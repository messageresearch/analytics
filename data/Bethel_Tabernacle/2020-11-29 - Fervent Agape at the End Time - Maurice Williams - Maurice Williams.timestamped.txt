[34:38] unusual year
[34:40] but we thank god for his grace amen
[34:43] it's been a year of things that we never
[34:45] even anticipated our plan but we thank
[34:47] god for his grace
[34:49] amen and us just coming up for
[34:51] thanksgiving you know this year
[34:53] this thanksgiving was a little bit
[34:54] different for me uh
[34:56] because it felt like i had a lot more to
[34:58] be grateful for
[34:59] man i know a lot of things been going on
[35:02] maybe personally in the saints lives and
[35:04] man even in my natural family we had a
[35:06] lot of people
[35:06] pass away some culvert related some not
[35:09] cover related they meant uh
[35:10] see my best friend from high school he
[35:12] lost a parent and my best friend from
[35:14] college lost a parent a man and i had
[35:16] close family members that
[35:18] lost parents one of my aunts passed away
[35:20] man two of mines passed away
[35:22] and then even uh in the midst everything
[35:24] going on sister tina's dad got very sick
[35:27] a minute
[35:27] he was on the ventilator for a few days
[35:29] a minute we seen some pass away but we
[35:32] seen by the grace of god that he's still
[35:34] on the scene
[35:35] and he was able to raise up my
[35:37] father-in-law off the ventilator by the
[35:39] grace of god amen
[35:40] so i'm saying all those things to say it
[35:43] it
[35:44] gives me a deep sense of appreciation
[35:47] because as you see the storm and the
[35:49] circumstances and the trials amen and
[35:51] all you got individual things that you
[35:53] had to go through man whether it's
[35:54] family members whether it was your jobs
[35:56] and different things
[35:56] but there's a god on the throne this
[35:58] morning
[36:00] and he's still in the business of
[36:02] keeping his people
[36:03] hallelujah and you know it makes us
[36:07] excited to be able to serve a god like
[36:09] that amen
[36:10] so we appreciate the invitation from
[36:12] brother jason this morning as always
[36:14] uh y'all keep sister blue and pray man
[36:17] she's still in the hospital she's kind
[36:19] of been in and out of icu
[36:21] and she had to have some different
[36:22] surgeries and things that was very high
[36:24] risk and
[36:25] had to move through some complications
[36:27] and fight with the breathing amen so
[36:29] y'all pray for it man the lord has kept
[36:31] it thus far
[36:33] and i looked at it as we've been still
[36:35] being in the fight each and every step
[36:36] of the way
[36:37] brother told me we're winning the fight
[36:39] amen so we're winning the fight by the
[36:41] grace of god so y'all remember the blue
[36:43] family brother blue has been
[36:44] strengths of him being in charleston a
[36:46] lot of man but the lord is in the
[36:47] business of taking care of his people
[36:49] and never forget that hallelujah we're
[36:52] going to look in the scripture this
[36:53] morning
[36:54] by the grace of god john the 13th
[36:56] chapter amen we usually read that for
[36:58] foot watching but we're going to go down
[36:59] a little bit further
[37:01] he's giving him some instructions as he
[37:03] leaves off the scene amen talking about
[37:04] the lord jesus this morning
[37:06] hallelujah hey amen it's good to be in
[37:09] the house of the lord amen i'm
[37:10] glad to be announced a little bit amen
[37:12] good to see all the saints here this
[37:14] morning amen
[37:16] and we'll just read it it says a new
[37:19] commandment
[37:20] i give unto you him preaching to the
[37:22] people amen
[37:24] that you love one another
[37:27] and he's going to give them a rubric or
[37:29] an example to show
[37:30] just how high you're supposed to love
[37:32] one another because you know we could
[37:33] say love in a lot of different ways but
[37:35] he says love one another
[37:36] as i have loved you
[37:41] now if you start to think i need to love
[37:43] somebody
[37:44] as the way that jesus christ loved us as
[37:47] individuals
[37:48] we cannot reach that with our own human
[37:50] mindset
[37:52] on our own human understanding he set
[37:54] the bar
[37:55] he set the ball very high by saying not
[37:58] only do you need to love one another
[38:00] but you need to love one another like i
[38:02] love you
[38:06] and the love of christ is something we
[38:07] can't explain we start here from now
[38:10] and we can spend a few years just trying
[38:11] to talk we can barely scratch the
[38:13] surface of the love of christ
[38:14] amen that you love one another as i have
[38:17] loved you that ye
[38:18] also love one another by this shall all
[38:21] men know that you are my disciples
[38:23] if you have love one to another praise
[38:26] god
[38:27] hallelujah let's just turn over to first
[38:29] peter
[38:30] four and seven
[38:35] and we'll read down to verse eight
[38:40] and then we'll let you have your seats
[38:42] this morning
[38:47] first peter 4 and 7 all the way down to
[38:50] verse 8
[38:52] it's good to be able to read the word
[38:54] almighty god
[38:58] scripture says but the end of all things
[39:02] is at hand how many believe that this
[39:05] morning
[39:06] because you know it's easy to read over
[39:07] those words but if you truly believe
[39:09] that the end of all things are at hand
[39:11] it will cause you to govern yourself
[39:13] differently
[39:16] the end of all things is at hand now
[39:19] he's going to give some instructions
[39:20] peter's going to give some instructions
[39:22] if you truly believe that in all things
[39:23] is at hand
[39:25] be therefore sober and watch unto prayer
[39:30] and now he's going to give further
[39:31] instructions and this is where we're
[39:32] going to draw emphasis on this morning
[39:34] because we read some things
[39:35] about love in the book of john and it
[39:37] says in above
[39:39] all things it's a lot of things you need
[39:42] to have
[39:43] but above all those things
[39:46] have fervent charity among yourselves
[39:50] seem like a simple thing but
[39:52] nevertheless at the end time he's saying
[39:54] above all else
[39:55] have fervent charity among yourselves
[39:59] for charity shall cover the multitude of
[40:02] sins amen let's just buy his this
[40:04] morning
[40:05] father god in the name of jesus lord we
[40:08] just thank you for the opportunity to
[40:09] come out this morning lord
[40:11] gather together with believers of light
[40:13] precious faith
[40:14] look into your word lord and see what
[40:16] you have to say for your people lord
[40:18] lord we kind of a great blessing lord
[40:21] that
[40:21] lord despite this year lord being such
[40:23] an unusual year father god
[40:26] nevertheless lord we're still standing
[40:27] here this morning lord proving lord that
[40:29] you're still in the business of taking
[40:30] care of your people father
[40:32] lord i pray that lord you're blessed
[40:33] each and every believer that's here lord
[40:35] the
[40:35] different ones that may be listening
[40:37] lord through the internet by different
[40:38] means father god a lot of different ones
[40:40] on the road lord
[40:41] lord take care of your people father god
[40:43] you've done it so far lord
[40:45] and we always trust you continue to do
[40:46] so lord lord as we turn our attention to
[40:49] the word this morning lord
[40:50] lord we always look to lead this place
[40:52] different to how we came in
[40:54] and lord we know that by the power of
[40:56] your holy spirit father god that's
[40:57] always in us lord
[40:59] that we always leave this place
[41:00] different than how we came in we think
[41:02] in the lovely name of jesus christ
[41:04] let's saints say amen amen you can be
[41:07] seated this morning
[41:11] when we're looking at the instructions
[41:13] that that peter laid out
[41:15] and when we were reading to you about
[41:17] how i was saying at the end of all
[41:19] things
[41:20] is at hand the end of all things is at
[41:24] hand and he
[41:24] peter he lays out some different
[41:27] instructions and different directions
[41:29] and what he says is above all things
[41:31] have fervent charity among yourselves
[41:34] amen
[41:36] now we know that word charity it means
[41:38] love amen
[41:39] and we've been well taught through the
[41:41] through the message amen
[41:42] there's different types of love amen
[41:44] brother branham took a lot of time to
[41:46] break down to us
[41:47] the different types of love because if
[41:49] you were to take this
[41:51] word love amen and look at a greek
[41:54] translation of the bible we know that
[41:56] the term
[41:56] that it uses instead of saying charity
[41:59] and instead of saying love
[42:00] it actually uses the word of goth
[42:02] payment
[42:03] and a god for love amen is something
[42:07] that's
[42:07] different all together
[42:11] and you know we talk about eros love
[42:13] amen that's just
[42:14] a man looking at a woman with a short
[42:15] skirt on lord help us all amen
[42:18] then they talk about feeling love that
[42:19] might be the love that a man has
[42:21] for his wife amen but when we start to
[42:24] talk about the agape
[42:25] love it talks about the divine love that
[42:29] almighty god
[42:30] has shown us amen and as he's shown that
[42:34] divine love towards us
[42:36] his expectation is that we start to show
[42:40] divine love back
[42:41] one to another now it's one thing for us
[42:45] to be able to show and demonstrate agape
[42:47] love
[42:48] but see what peter is talking about he's
[42:50] talking about the
[42:51] end time amen and if you believe that
[42:55] we're at the end time
[42:56] there's a certain way that you got to
[42:57] govern yourselves even
[42:59] so our title for the swarming is going
[43:02] to be
[43:03] fervent agape at the end time even
[43:08] fervent agape at the end time amen
[43:13] i'm not here so much to preach you a
[43:14] love message this morning there man
[43:17] but this is an end time message
[43:20] the brother is sitting there saying you
[43:22] know it's different things going to be
[43:23] on
[43:24] but the end of all things is at hand
[43:27] and see if you truly believe that the
[43:29] end of all things are at hand amen
[43:32] then you make a proper preparation
[43:35] you're getting yourself ready
[43:37] come on now we know that the message of
[43:38] the hour it didn't come
[43:40] to make us good people it didn't come
[43:43] just so the sisters can have long hair
[43:45] and what skirts amen that's all fine and
[43:48] good amen that's what the word
[43:50] asks us to do but what the message came
[43:52] to do
[43:53] is get us ready for the second coming of
[43:55] almighty god
[43:58] it's come to prepare us amen and get us
[44:00] ready god sent a prophet amen to get our
[44:03] hearts turned
[44:04] into the right direction so the message
[44:07] didn't come just to make us good
[44:09] people but it's making us good people
[44:11] amen
[44:12] to move towards the rapture amen and if
[44:15] you're looking for a rapture
[44:17] then you've got to believe that in all
[44:19] things is at hand amen
[44:23] god sent a prophet to get the people out
[44:25] of the nominations amen
[44:26] because we were doing all kind of things
[44:27] nominations get the people back into the
[44:30] bible amen get them back into the word
[44:33] because christ is coming
[44:35] and the people needed to get ready how
[44:38] are we going to get ready unless he sent
[44:40] us a messenger
[44:41] to let us know exactly what we needed to
[44:43] be doing to get ready
[44:45] and here all along we think well we're
[44:47] doing this and that's allowing me to get
[44:48] ready
[44:49] but no he sends a messenger with a
[44:51] prophetic influence
[44:53] to let us know exactly what we need to
[44:55] be doing to get rid of it man
[44:59] and so us recognizing that we're getting
[45:02] ready amen and hopefully by now we're
[45:03] not just getting ready but we are ready
[45:05] glory to god i mean getting ready time
[45:07] is is widening up saints
[45:09] the bible is letting us know to end all
[45:11] things at hand
[45:13] and when peter wrote that amen surely
[45:15] things were moving so quickly at the
[45:17] time and then they thought christ was
[45:19] coming right then
[45:20] but no it was a a a a time period that
[45:23] things had to go through it man
[45:26] the prophet of god it meant brother
[45:27] branham in this day and age i mean he
[45:29] took us through
[45:30] how those seven church agents had to
[45:31] play out amen how god had to allow a
[45:34] portion of time
[45:35] for you to be here in the midst of 2020
[45:39] in the midst of a pandemic in the midst
[45:41] of laid to see it going on
[45:43] all around us amen and maybe all through
[45:46] the ages that the saints will read the
[45:48] scriptures and say well they end all
[45:49] things at hand
[45:50] but no i can truly tell you this morning
[45:53] saints
[45:54] the end of all things is that ahead so
[46:00] we call us being endtime people
[46:02] we look at ourselves as a as being
[46:06] evening time people amen because we know
[46:09] time is winding up on the clock
[46:11] so so so what that does is it should put
[46:14] us in a certain sense of urgency
[46:16] it should always keep us in a certain
[46:18] sense of desperation
[46:20] and in a time period where where people
[46:22] are going to church less and we're
[46:24] comfortable at home watching things on
[46:25] the internet
[46:26] and maybe we're not reading our bible as
[46:28] much and but at the same time if we
[46:30] truly believe that the end of all things
[46:32] is at hand
[46:33] we should have that urgency about us
[46:38] you know some people might be sports
[46:39] fans of different things that man
[46:41] if you've got a team that you might like
[46:44] amen there's nothing worse than seeing
[46:45] that team it's the fourth quarter
[46:47] and they're not acting like it's the
[46:48] fourth quarter they're moseying around
[46:51] and
[46:51] they're dropping the ball and they're
[46:53] playing basketball he's taking his time
[46:54] bringing the ball up the court or the
[46:56] quarterback he not having to rush to
[46:58] snap the ball and different things
[47:00] if you know that the end of the game is
[47:03] coming
[47:03] all right you will move at a certain
[47:06] pace
[47:07] don't matter if you winning or not you
[47:09] still gonna have a certain pace about
[47:11] you
[47:12] and i'm here to remind you this morning
[47:14] since we are in the fourth quarter
[47:17] now is not the time to be dragging your
[47:19] feet all right
[47:20] now is not the time to be getting tired
[47:23] now is not the time to be distracted by
[47:26] the things of the world amen
[47:28] by the riches of the world amen man i've
[47:31] seen the political season come through
[47:33] it distracted so many people from the
[47:35] things of god
[47:37] now is the time to be focusing on the
[47:39] things that almighty god
[47:41] has for his people to enter all things
[47:43] is at hand
[47:48] you know if we believe at the end all
[47:50] things at hand
[47:52] then that means that almighty god has
[47:54] given us enough time
[47:56] to progress into a certain level of
[47:59] maturity
[48:00] spiritually that we know more babes that
[48:03] need the sense of milk or the gospel
[48:05] amen
[48:06] but if they end all things at hand then
[48:09] by the power of god
[48:10] preaching his word through his servants
[48:12] through pastors they've been through
[48:14] through wednesday's service they've been
[48:16] through sunday school
[48:17] on sunday mornings they mean we should
[48:19] be at a certain sense of maturity by now
[48:21] right
[48:22] we should have moved into our adoption
[48:25] amen
[48:26] that brother branham preached about all
[48:27] those years
[48:30] because when we talk about you being
[48:31] saved yeah that's one thing you believe
[48:33] amen almighty god takes care of you
[48:35] then the scriptures let you know how you
[48:37] receive the holy ghost since you believe
[48:39] praise god he put instills you with his
[48:41] power amen and now you got the ability
[48:43] to do things that you could not do on
[48:45] your own
[48:45] by the power of the holy ghost amen but
[48:48] you still have to come all the way into
[48:50] your adoption
[48:52] and that's a positional placing
[48:55] because all of us got a role within the
[48:57] body but once you come into your
[48:59] adoption
[49:00] you know exactly who you are you know
[49:02] exactly what you should be doing
[49:05] you know exactly what the father's
[49:07] business is
[49:08] and now you're not being laxed about the
[49:10] father's business
[49:11] but now you have developed to the point
[49:13] where you can run the father's business
[49:16] you develop to a point where where where
[49:19] your name being on the check is just as
[49:21] good as the father's name being on the
[49:23] check
[49:24] you develop to the point if you say
[49:26] so-and-so is hired
[49:28] then that means that they're hired and
[49:30] such such as fire
[49:31] that means that they're fired see the
[49:33] father even though you were a son all
[49:35] along
[49:35] he he held back a certain amount of
[49:38] responsibility
[49:39] but because you kept maturing now you
[49:42] had a certain level of responsibility
[49:45] and sometimes it seemed like we don't
[49:47] act like we should be at a certain level
[49:49] of responsibility when it comes to the
[49:50] things of almighty god
[49:54] still having to deal with little things
[49:56] amen still having to get our heart right
[49:58] for little things
[50:00] and hear the scripture letting us know
[50:01] that in all things is at hand
[50:03] we shouldn't still be saying well i'm
[50:04] gonna try to do better with that next
[50:06] time around
[50:06] now is the time to claim it that i am
[50:10] gonna do better with it by the grace of
[50:11] god
[50:12] amen hallelujah i'm gonna love the lord
[50:14] this morning
[50:16] just look at the scriptures this morning
[50:18] i'm not sure what time i started but
[50:19] we're not gonna be here long before you
[50:21] hallelujah amen not here to preach a
[50:24] love message to you but just
[50:25] to preach end time message to you
[50:28] because we need to be focused on
[50:29] the end time amen
[50:34] peter when he was writing out the
[50:35] scripture even he was writing out this
[50:37] epistle amen
[50:39] he said but the end of all things at
[50:40] hand be therefore the first thing he
[50:42] tells me is to be
[50:43] therefore sober be
[50:46] there for sober there's a lot of things
[50:50] that can cause you to be
[50:52] inebriated in this day and age of me to
[50:54] be drunk and people get drunk off of the
[50:56] things of life i mean
[50:58] people getting drunk by what their focus
[51:00] is and
[51:01] and getting drunk trying to make this
[51:02] amount of money or having this amount of
[51:04] carry man lord didn't
[51:08] call for us to be drunk off of the
[51:10] things of life amen
[51:12] if we're drunk off of anything
[51:15] we drunk off of this stimulation by
[51:17] revelation
[51:19] we're drunk off of this wine that
[51:21] almighty god has poured through the
[51:23] gospel amen
[51:26] that no matter what the enemy did he
[51:28] couldn't hurt not touch it amen
[51:29] praise god not to be inebriated by the
[51:33] things of the world amen
[51:34] but to be sober to be sober means that
[51:38] you're being
[51:39] alert you're looking at what's going on
[51:42] you're not getting mixed up by what's
[51:43] going on amen you're being
[51:45] vigilant hey man you're watching you're
[51:48] being
[51:49] short because you're not partaking in
[51:51] these things of the world
[51:52] that allows you to keep a laser light
[51:55] focused
[51:56] on the things that almighty god has for
[51:58] his people
[52:00] that's because you sober
[52:06] you know there's so much that that's
[52:07] going on that's starting to take
[52:09] people's
[52:10] eyes and minds off of the word of god
[52:14] and see we have to if you sober
[52:17] what will happen is you start to
[52:19] recognize the spirit behind different
[52:21] things
[52:23] and then when the world starts going
[52:24] through different things instead of you
[52:26] getting in a panic
[52:27] like the rest of the world you'll say
[52:29] you know what there's a spirit behind
[52:31] those things
[52:33] there's a spirit putting the world into
[52:34] a turmoil with different things hey man
[52:37] and yeah you got to recognize the the
[52:39] spirit that's that's moving amen
[52:42] because see what almighty god did for us
[52:44] people will tell you this morning
[52:45] the holy ghost does a lot of things for
[52:47] the people of god
[52:49] the holy ghost does a lot of things for
[52:51] the people of god what i like saying
[52:52] that court of god
[52:54] the holy ghost it does a lot of things
[52:56] for the people of god
[52:58] if you wish you wash and you need power
[53:00] guess what the holy ghost
[53:02] it'll give you power amen if you need a
[53:05] healing within your life amen
[53:07] the holy ghost will raise up your faith
[53:09] in man to claim your healing
[53:12] if you need to get right amen and stop
[53:15] doing little things that shouldn't be
[53:16] doing
[53:16] holy ghost to take care of that
[53:19] but you know one of the things that the
[53:21] holy ghost does for the people of god
[53:23] that we overlook sometimes
[53:24] is that the holy ghost it gives his
[53:27] people
[53:27] a spirit of discernment
[53:31] when i'm talking about a spirit of
[53:32] discernment amen that's you being able
[53:34] to look at
[53:35] something and not just see what's on the
[53:39] surface
[53:40] but you see the spirit that's that's
[53:42] pushing people in different directions
[53:47] people not upset and angry just to be
[53:48] upset and angry it's a spirit making
[53:50] people upset and angry amen
[53:52] and then you turn around now you got
[53:54] people that's angry at the ones that's
[53:55] angry
[53:56] man and now everybody's angry
[53:59] because it's spirits that's doing that
[54:01] we don't wrestle against flesh and blood
[54:05] but against spiritual wickedness high
[54:08] places amen
[54:10] and if you're sober you're watching
[54:12] what's going on
[54:13] you're not getting focused on the
[54:15] distraction well this one doing this and
[54:16] that one doing that what's going on with
[54:18] that
[54:19] no we're so reminded we're watching
[54:21] what's going on within the gospel
[54:24] because he said right there hey man why
[54:26] you being so baby
[54:28] he said be there for so baby man and
[54:31] watching
[54:32] not just watching just to know what's
[54:34] going on
[54:35] not just watching the news just to know
[54:37] what this person's doing that and this
[54:39] party wants this and that party want
[54:41] this and this candidate do that we're
[54:42] not just watching to watch for those
[54:44] things amen
[54:45] but we're watching a man onto prayer
[54:49] watching that god will keep his people
[54:52] in the midst of the stormy man watching
[54:56] the know what direction we need to be
[54:57] praying towards it man
[55:00] now your prayer in this day and age is
[55:03] god save america amen
[55:04] i'm gonna tell y'all now you you waste
[55:06] your time with that prayer
[55:09] if you're praying for lord put this
[55:10] candidate in office so he'll save the
[55:13] america for and take america back for
[55:15] god
[55:16] you you you missed the train all
[55:18] together
[55:21] i can show you in the book of revelation
[55:22] amen america's time is wide enough and
[55:25] then
[55:25] it's tied down in revelation 13 that's
[55:26] what brother brown showed us amen
[55:29] america had the opportunity
[55:32] and now it's all about god making sure
[55:35] that he has
[55:36] his wife ready without spot not blemish
[55:39] amen
[55:40] so if you're gonna pray towards anything
[55:42] in this hour
[55:43] say lord i pray that your bride or make
[55:45] herself ready
[55:47] because we got to get up out of here man
[55:49] i'm going to have to wear a mask for the
[55:51] rest of my life
[55:51] i i'm starting to realize you know i
[55:53] want to be able to go on different trips
[55:55] and do different things
[55:56] and i'm starting to realize you know the
[55:58] things that people took joy and within
[56:00] this world
[56:00] those things could be gone in the blink
[56:02] of an eye and there's got to be
[56:04] something greater that we're looking
[56:06] towards
[56:07] and i believe the lord allowed us to get
[56:09] shaken up a little bit because a lot of
[56:11] us were getting a little bit too
[56:12] comfortable with our nice cars and our
[56:14] nice houses and taking all of our trips
[56:17] and
[56:17] you can go on all these shopping
[56:19] discourages amen and all of a sudden
[56:20] those things get pulled away from you
[56:23] and you realize you don't got nothing to
[56:25] stand upon
[56:26] but the word of almighty god
[56:29] not but one thing that's certain and
[56:32] that is the power of the blood of jesus
[56:34] christ
[56:36] according to god amen people got mixed
[56:40] up they said if we put bond in office
[56:42] that'll make it more stable
[56:43] i beg your pardon they said well if we
[56:45] keep trumping office that'll make it
[56:47] more stable
[56:48] i beg your pardon there's not but one
[56:51] thing that can bring stability within
[56:53] your life
[56:55] hallelujah say that again there's not
[56:59] but one thing
[57:00] that will bring stability into your life
[57:05] there's nothing but jesus christ this
[57:06] morning hallelujah
[57:09] and it's good to know him amen
[57:13] he just said while you're watching be
[57:15] watching unto prayer amen
[57:17] y'all pray for one another as you see
[57:20] things going on
[57:21] pray for one another amen the ones
[57:24] that's out there working man i know
[57:26] y'all got a lot of
[57:26] saints here that work in the health care
[57:28] field they may pray for them even
[57:30] the different brothers had businesses
[57:31] and those businesses had to slow down
[57:33] because all that was going on y'all pray
[57:35] for one another
[57:37] pray for your past damn none of these
[57:38] pastors have have passed to the church
[57:40] doing a pandemic before
[57:42] we should be praying for one another
[57:45] the moms is at school at home and
[57:48] homeschooling the kids a minute
[57:50] maybe some had kids out in school and
[57:51] you had to bring them in amen y'all pray
[57:53] for the moms at home with them kids amen
[57:55] we ought to be praying one for another
[57:58] yeah our hearts and our minds in our
[58:01] conversation
[58:03] it should be more towards prayer because
[58:05] saints i'm here to tell you this morning
[58:07] prayer changes things hallelujah glory
[58:10] to god
[58:11] amen when they gave up on my
[58:14] father-in-law amen and they said well
[58:15] they call us at midnight so we're going
[58:16] to put them on the ventilator but you
[58:18] know it was people that was already
[58:20] praying amen
[58:21] and he got off that ventilator so
[58:23] quickly the doctors was amazed
[58:26] we said lord we need you to do a miracle
[58:28] and he did a miracle because prayer
[58:30] changes things and man
[58:32] when sister blue is in the midst of her
[58:34] battle amen in the doctors basically
[58:35] kind of said well
[58:37] we we we're not showing it but you know
[58:39] the effectual fervent prayer of the
[58:41] righteous
[58:42] the bible says that the veil of much
[58:44] amen
[58:45] and the lord uh because the lord has got
[58:48] the works of miracles amen because
[58:50] naturally
[58:50] it didn't look very good but god is
[58:53] still in the miracle working business
[58:54] he's praying scott he's still in the
[58:56] miracle working business
[58:58] so if you don't do nothing else pray for
[59:00] one another
[59:02] hallelujah and peter as he's saying
[59:05] those things he's saying i want you none
[59:07] of those things
[59:07] you've been sober as you've been
[59:09] watching and watching under prayer
[59:11] then he turned around and he said above
[59:13] all else
[59:15] have fervent charity among yourselves
[59:19] not just charity among yourselves
[59:21] fervent charity among yourselves
[59:24] and i told you that that a charity amen
[59:27] it talks about
[59:28] agape amen agape love divine love god's
[59:30] own love
[59:32] but the branham he had a vision we all
[59:35] familiar with he talks about it beyond
[59:37] the curtain of time and
[59:38] and and he came out of that vision and
[59:41] when he was
[59:41] uh was rehashing the vision to the
[59:43] people he man he was saying
[59:45] you know i'm convinced not more than
[59:47] ever
[59:48] that you're gonna need perfect love to
[59:51] be able to
[59:51] enter in over there man he had a vision
[59:54] of heaven and he was talking about
[59:55] uh oh my how the sisters were running up
[59:57] to him and how they could just hug him
[59:58] and there was no type of human sensation
[1:00:01] he was wondering what it was and
[1:00:03] he said a voice came down from heaven he
[1:00:05] said that this is perfect love
[1:00:08] and nothing can enter in here without it
[1:00:14] the prophet of god that we all follow
[1:00:16] amen that we believe that almighty god
[1:00:18] sent us amen as promised through the
[1:00:19] scripture through malachi
[1:00:20] 4 and 5 and he is saying that we won't
[1:00:23] be able to
[1:00:24] enter in without perfect love
[1:00:28] you know in a lot of ways love and when
[1:00:30] we talk about love it's a very
[1:00:32] elementary concept amen and i know we
[1:00:34] talk about a lot of mysteries and things
[1:00:36] but you know love is a very deep mystery
[1:00:39] and that the prophet is sitting here
[1:00:41] saying that without
[1:00:42] perfect love you won't be able to enter
[1:00:44] in
[1:00:45] what he's letting us know is that we can
[1:00:47] know the scripture frontlines and
[1:00:48] backwards
[1:00:49] we can know the quotes all kind of
[1:00:51] different ways we can come to the church
[1:00:53] every time the doors are open
[1:00:54] we can give all kind of money in church
[1:00:56] and if we have not reached the
[1:00:58] standpoint of perfect love
[1:01:00] we will not be able to enter in
[1:01:04] so now love comes from being a simple
[1:01:07] thing amen that's an elementary concept
[1:01:09] to it being a deep thing amen that
[1:01:12] you're not gonna be able to enter in
[1:01:14] without perfect love so if we can't get
[1:01:18] you to anything else in this hour
[1:01:20] i need to be getting you back towards
[1:01:22] perfect love cause you won't be able to
[1:01:24] enter in without it
[1:01:27] that's fervent charity amongst
[1:01:29] yourselves amen
[1:01:31] perfect charity you know the the
[1:01:34] christian experience
[1:01:35] what makes it a different type of
[1:01:37] experience from
[1:01:38] a lot of the other religions out there
[1:01:40] is when you talk about christianity
[1:01:43] you have to believe as an individual
[1:01:44] amen praise god
[1:01:46] you have to accept jesus christ as your
[1:01:48] personal savior
[1:01:50] you have to repent you have to be
[1:01:53] baptized in the name of the lord jesus
[1:01:55] for the remission of your sins
[1:01:57] so you got all these individual works
[1:01:59] that you're doing amen
[1:02:01] and then all of a sudden after you do
[1:02:03] all of those individual works then the
[1:02:06] bible lets us know because by one spirit
[1:02:08] we are baptized into one body
[1:02:12] so now all of a sudden your christian
[1:02:14] experience
[1:02:15] shows the individual experience amen
[1:02:17] that's how the gentiles had the cma man
[1:02:20] you have to see them individually
[1:02:21] compared to israel israel has set them
[1:02:23] as a nation the gentiles are settled
[1:02:25] individually
[1:02:26] but even in your gentile walk
[1:02:28] nevertheless you are part of a body
[1:02:31] so what happens is you got all of these
[1:02:34] individual works
[1:02:35] and all those individual works what it
[1:02:37] does it places you into a body amen
[1:02:41] and once you in the body you have to
[1:02:44] have
[1:02:45] perfect love
[1:02:49] that concept of a body amen it's a heavy
[1:02:52] concept amen
[1:02:53] by one spirit we baptize into one body
[1:02:56] amen
[1:02:56] and what happens is it takes the focus
[1:02:59] away from you as an individual
[1:03:01] what brother maurice could do or what
[1:03:03] brother so-and-so could do a man
[1:03:05] and what it does it puts the emphasis
[1:03:06] back onto the body
[1:03:08] because sometimes we get caught up in
[1:03:10] different things
[1:03:11] and the emphasis gets taken off for the
[1:03:14] body man i'm talking about the body of
[1:03:15] christ
[1:03:16] that all of us believers are part of but
[1:03:18] if we keep
[1:03:19] perfect love going amongst ourselves if
[1:03:23] we keep fervent charity amongst
[1:03:25] ourselves
[1:03:25] the focus and the mindset will always go
[1:03:28] back to the body
[1:03:32] you know the reason why these brothers
[1:03:33] ain't meant to dedicate their lives to
[1:03:35] preaching the gospel
[1:03:36] it's not so much for their sake amen
[1:03:39] glory to god hopefully it's not for
[1:03:40] their own gain or personal gain or
[1:03:42] whatever
[1:03:43] but it's because they want to see the
[1:03:44] health of the body
[1:03:46] they want to see the progress of the
[1:03:48] body amen we're doing these things for
[1:03:50] the benefit of the body of christ
[1:03:52] amen hopefully when we preach we all
[1:03:57] preaching the same
[1:03:58] thing because now we're showing you that
[1:03:59] there's order within the body
[1:04:02] and it don't matter if you take a
[1:04:03] preacher from green pond south carolina
[1:04:05] from north carolina from beautiful amen
[1:04:07] uh from uganda africa amen all over the
[1:04:10] globe
[1:04:11] we'll all be preaching the same thing by
[1:04:13] the grace of god
[1:04:14] because it's not about us it's about
[1:04:16] being part of a body amen
[1:04:19] hallelujah and almighty god has sent a
[1:04:22] ministry
[1:04:22] to keep the body in order and to keep
[1:04:25] the body alive
[1:04:30] so it takes the focus off of making it
[1:04:32] about us amen
[1:04:33] who got what revelation and who's
[1:04:36] spiritual well i'm the only one with
[1:04:37] this revelation no ain't about your
[1:04:39] revelation like
[1:04:40] daddy man it is but it isn't it's all
[1:04:42] about the body amen
[1:04:45] and that's why you need fervent charity
[1:04:48] man
[1:04:49] above all things have fervent charity
[1:04:51] among yourselves that word fervent
[1:04:53] that's an unusual word we don't use it
[1:04:55] very often so i had to look it up just
[1:04:57] to make sure i had to fully understand
[1:04:58] what that word fervent means
[1:05:00] fervent means that it's hot
[1:05:03] come on now it's not just dull it's not
[1:05:05] just moses alone
[1:05:06] fervent charity is hot
[1:05:09] it's intense it's enthusiastic
[1:05:14] sometimes it seems like people are no
[1:05:16] longer enthusiastic about the things of
[1:05:18] god
[1:05:19] they can get enthusiastic about other
[1:05:21] things i mean about your sports team
[1:05:24] about the political races going on about
[1:05:26] your garden and things they meant by
[1:05:27] these new clothes that you found on the
[1:05:29] internet amen
[1:05:30] let's get enthusiastic about the things
[1:05:32] almighty god
[1:05:35] let's get enthusiastic about our love
[1:05:37] towards one another amen
[1:05:39] i told you this is an end time message
[1:05:42] and peter's letting us know
[1:05:43] the end all things is at hand it's time
[1:05:46] for you to be
[1:05:47] hot in your love towards one another in
[1:05:49] an agape way man praise god
[1:05:53] intense enthusiastic passionate
[1:05:56] burning glowing those are all adjectives
[1:06:00] that you use to describe
[1:06:02] the word fervent amen
[1:06:06] see when the bible talks about this age
[1:06:09] that's all around us saving that age and
[1:06:10] laid to see how it's all around us
[1:06:12] remember the scripture refers to them as
[1:06:14] being a lukewarm age
[1:06:16] lukewarm age god has blessed us when we
[1:06:20] were able to come out of the lair to see
[1:06:21] amen but we see the influence all around
[1:06:23] us of that lukewarmness
[1:06:25] and the bible is letting us know in the
[1:06:27] midst of lukewarm being all around you
[1:06:29] know we talking about the church world
[1:06:30] now
[1:06:31] we're talking about the church world
[1:06:32] being lukewarm because the scripture
[1:06:34] lets us know that in the rest of the
[1:06:35] world they said the love of many will
[1:06:36] wax cold
[1:06:37] so you got the cold over here that's the
[1:06:39] world then you've got the church world
[1:06:41] that's the pentecostal church
[1:06:42] specifically amen the lay of the c.a.j
[1:06:44] man they're lukewarm
[1:06:46] but in the midst of them being cold over
[1:06:48] there and the nominal church being
[1:06:49] lukewarm
[1:06:50] god has called his people amen his bride
[1:06:53] his believers that he's cut out for his
[1:06:55] portion and set aside
[1:06:57] he's called for you to be fervent
[1:07:00] enthusiastic
[1:07:01] hot burning glowing for the things of
[1:07:04] god amen
[1:07:07] that's the example that he's called us
[1:07:09] to set forth with me
[1:07:12] now feeling your love for leo can go a
[1:07:13] long way man
[1:07:15] but you can't call that enthusiastic in
[1:07:18] this sense amen
[1:07:20] see the concept of agape love is such a
[1:07:23] deep and unusual concept
[1:07:25] uh you know it's hard for us to grasp it
[1:07:27] up front
[1:07:28] but you know your understanding of
[1:07:31] love and your standard of agape love it
[1:07:33] should grow more and more it should keep
[1:07:35] furthering itself it should keep
[1:07:37] developing itself amen
[1:07:39] even with a natural love you know uh
[1:07:41] when a young man finds a wife a man
[1:07:44] i see brother chris there with his wife
[1:07:45] amen he just you know when a young man
[1:07:47] finds
[1:07:47] i know they've been married for a while
[1:07:48] even but when a young man finds a wifey
[1:07:51] man
[1:07:52] you know he loves her man you know you
[1:07:54] might have seen
[1:07:55] different other women out there but
[1:07:56] there's something about this woman in
[1:07:58] there something about when i met sister
[1:07:59] tina
[1:08:00] she was different from any other woman i
[1:08:02] had ever met
[1:08:03] and it caught my attention i said you
[1:08:05] know what i think i love her
[1:08:08] and at that point in time i love her you
[1:08:10] know i didn't know if i could love any
[1:08:12] higher than that i just knew that i
[1:08:13] loved him
[1:08:14] it was nothing i ever felt or
[1:08:15] experienced before
[1:08:17] but you know with love it unfolds itself
[1:08:20] in different ways amen
[1:08:22] and as you spend more time together
[1:08:24] maybe uh
[1:08:25] your your wife maybe she bears a child
[1:08:27] for you man you start raising children
[1:08:29] together i mean now your love
[1:08:30] unfolds in a different way man maybe you
[1:08:33] might have a situation where you you get
[1:08:35] injured or you get hurt or you need
[1:08:37] something
[1:08:38] and now that spouse can take care of you
[1:08:40] amen so now that love is unfolding in a
[1:08:42] different way that you didn't have that
[1:08:43] opportunity for in the beginning amen
[1:08:46] maybe as you get older amen and you see
[1:08:48] your children and they have
[1:08:50] grandchildren all of a sudden you
[1:08:51] thought you loved your children and you
[1:08:52] did love your children but now that love
[1:08:54] is unfolding in a different way
[1:08:56] because different opportunities and
[1:08:58] different circumstances
[1:09:00] it allows more opportunity for love to
[1:09:02] unfold in a different way
[1:09:04] maybe y'all go through a hard financial
[1:09:06] difficulty and you see how the two y'all
[1:09:09] work together and y'all navigate that
[1:09:10] thing
[1:09:11] and you know you come out of it and say
[1:09:12] you're not always loving but you know
[1:09:14] i i i feel a higher level of love
[1:09:17] towards a now
[1:09:18] after i've come out of this thing that's
[1:09:20] because love it keeps unfolding
[1:09:23] really i'm gonna tell you this moment
[1:09:24] just like faith is a revelation perfect
[1:09:26] love is a revelation too amen
[1:09:28] and as different things take place amen
[1:09:31] and different things get revealed to you
[1:09:32] you'll find out that love keeps growing
[1:09:36] and so it is with the things of almighty
[1:09:38] god amen
[1:09:39] as you see him amen and when he saves
[1:09:41] you you love him in one way
[1:09:43] and then you see how he keeps you from a
[1:09:45] certain circumstance then you love him
[1:09:46] even more
[1:09:47] then you see him how he reveals himself
[1:09:49] to you by the power of his word
[1:09:51] then you love him even more man maybe
[1:09:53] somebody gets sick and then he
[1:09:54] he heals that person for you i mean you
[1:09:56] love him even more and then
[1:09:58] maybe you see what's going on in the
[1:09:59] world and how he's able to keep you from
[1:10:02] those things of the world
[1:10:03] and you see you know the lord if it
[1:10:05] wasn't for all your holy ghost
[1:10:06] i would have been right out there with
[1:10:08] the wrestling lord i see how much you
[1:10:10] love me amen
[1:10:12] and what he's doing he's given
[1:10:14] opportunities he he's given
[1:10:16] circumstances for the
[1:10:18] for the things of god to keep on fooling
[1:10:20] themselves
[1:10:22] because love is a revelation amen it's
[1:10:24] never stagnant it keeps growing
[1:10:27] it keeps moving hey man you should love
[1:10:28] your wife more today than you did
[1:10:30] 5 10 15 years ago because it keeps
[1:10:33] growing it
[1:10:33] it keeps moving by the grace of god
[1:10:37] you know one thing that that that's
[1:10:39] keeping me amen just as i see what
[1:10:41] almighty god is doing for the saints
[1:10:43] amen as i see him how he's kept all of
[1:10:46] these saints through all of these years
[1:10:49] and people are still on fire for god
[1:10:50] like it was in the beginning
[1:10:52] you know you know that's god and phone
[1:10:54] is love amen
[1:10:56] i appreciate that it man as he keeps us
[1:10:58] through all the storms i mean
[1:11:00] as he unfolds his love in that way man i
[1:11:02] appreciate that amen
[1:11:05] what we talking about we talking about
[1:11:06] agape man we talking about
[1:11:08] fervent agape man video love hey man
[1:11:12] feel the love it's all right amen but
[1:11:15] what fellow love does it works off of
[1:11:16] feelings
[1:11:18] feelings can be very wishy-washy up and
[1:11:20] down amen feelings can be back and forth
[1:11:22] you can't always trust your feelings
[1:11:24] when it comes to stuff hey
[1:11:25] you can trust your discernment but your
[1:11:27] feelings now you can feel one way and
[1:11:29] you can be totally
[1:11:30] opposite against the will of god because
[1:11:31] of your feelings amen
[1:11:33] so feelings and discernment are two
[1:11:34] totally different things
[1:11:36] feel your love it works off of feelings
[1:11:39] feel your love
[1:11:40] it works out for reasoning well this
[1:11:42] person is a good person so i guess i
[1:11:44] better love them because they're a good
[1:11:45] person and he got good shoulders and she
[1:11:47] got nice long pretty thick hair man
[1:11:49] feel your lover get you in trouble
[1:11:52] cause it works off of feelings and
[1:11:54] reasoning too much amen
[1:11:57] a god pay love it works off of
[1:11:58] revelation
[1:12:01] it's been revealed to me through the
[1:12:02] course of time how my god loves me
[1:12:05] it's been revealed to me through
[1:12:07] different circumstances and different
[1:12:08] situations
[1:12:10] how my god loves me man and one thing
[1:12:13] about a revelation saying
[1:12:14] whenever you get a revelation the
[1:12:16] almighty god has given you
[1:12:18] personally as an individual there's not
[1:12:20] a devil in hell that can rip that away
[1:12:22] from you
[1:12:23] that's your rock that's your revelation
[1:12:27] that's what god gave me and i'm not
[1:12:29] giving it back
[1:12:30] whatever almighty god reveals to you
[1:12:33] saints don't ever try to give it back
[1:12:36] a lot of people fall away because they
[1:12:38] never had a revelation to begin with
[1:12:40] but you know if you got your own rock
[1:12:42] that you standing on amen
[1:12:44] you might not be able to explain it you
[1:12:46] might not be able to explain to somebody
[1:12:48] else why you love so and so for such and
[1:12:50] such amen
[1:12:51] but the love of god amen if he's
[1:12:53] revealed himself to you
[1:12:55] you love him in a way you just can't
[1:12:57] explain to everybody else amen
[1:12:59] hallelujah that's a god they love him
[1:13:03] what happened too many people got filial
[1:13:05] love and agape love
[1:13:06] mixed up all of these years they man
[1:13:09] because a lot of times people think that
[1:13:10] they got a god for love and it's really
[1:13:12] feel your love amen people get tested
[1:13:16] and they feel this world got tested with
[1:13:18] his love just a few months ago all
[1:13:20] through the course this year
[1:13:21] and it failed the test in flying colors
[1:13:24] amen
[1:13:25] cause nobody else can put themselves in
[1:13:27] somebody else's shoes
[1:13:30] you know maybe if you somebody that lost
[1:13:32] the family member to the virus and
[1:13:33] different things you would say well
[1:13:35] you know maybe they should put on that
[1:13:36] maybe everybody should put on some masks
[1:13:38] because that's what you're looking at it
[1:13:39] from that's your point of view it man
[1:13:41] but then maybe if you somebody that you
[1:13:42] had a business that you poured your
[1:13:44] heart and your soul into
[1:13:46] and you dedicated your life to this
[1:13:47] business all your life savings was in it
[1:13:49] and just all of a sudden the virus come
[1:13:50] in and now all of a sudden you got to
[1:13:52] shut down
[1:13:53] but they're leaving walmart open and
[1:13:54] they're leaving lowe's open so that
[1:13:56] caused you to feel a certain way
[1:13:58] but this person over here well they lost
[1:13:59] a family member and what happens is
[1:14:01] because nobody got love for nobody
[1:14:03] else's situation
[1:14:05] everybody just sitting on the sides of
[1:14:06] the fence angry at each other
[1:14:10] but if we had love for one another maybe
[1:14:11] we could put ourselves in in my first
[1:14:14] cousin's shoes
[1:14:15] and my brother-in-law's shoes that lost
[1:14:16] his uh lost his mom a few weeks ago he
[1:14:19] made
[1:14:19] or maybe you could put yourselves in the
[1:14:21] shoes of that family that
[1:14:22] that lost everything that they had that
[1:14:24] had that good business that was going
[1:14:27] because things are booming things just
[1:14:28] looking good that
[1:14:30] dedicated their life to that thing but
[1:14:32] see it's hard for this human world
[1:14:34] to have that kind of love
[1:14:37] love got to be a revelation amen
[1:14:41] and talking about people race relations
[1:14:43] and people being upset with the police
[1:14:45] that's cause the world lost is loving
[1:14:47] man
[1:14:48] and people got angry man and one thing i
[1:14:51] i tell people all the time amen
[1:14:53] you know you might feel like well maybe
[1:14:55] my black life matters or
[1:14:57] white life matters or blue life matters
[1:14:59] but what i like to tell people is that
[1:15:00] your spiritual life matters
[1:15:03] your spiritual life matters and if i can
[1:15:07] get you to understand that your
[1:15:08] spiritual life
[1:15:09] matters then you're going to treat
[1:15:11] people a lot differently
[1:15:18] because you know people can be very evil
[1:15:20] that don't have the holy ghost now
[1:15:22] i'm saying tell you now people could be
[1:15:23] awful if they don't have the holy ghost
[1:15:25] man i've been done wrong by the police
[1:15:27] get out your car you've been drinking
[1:15:28] i don't i haven't been drinking well why
[1:15:30] are you driving so slow well i'm driving
[1:15:32] slow because the speed limit is a
[1:15:34] certain way and i know this is a speed
[1:15:35] trap well get out your car and they
[1:15:36] fussing and everything you know
[1:15:37] different things can happen there man
[1:15:39] people are evil
[1:15:40] man we we've had death threats our house
[1:15:42] and different things before with the
[1:15:43] little news and different things because
[1:15:44] people are evil you can't trust people
[1:15:46] without the holy ghost amen
[1:15:48] but one thing that i've learned amen and
[1:15:51] because god has put
[1:15:52] a certain amount of agape love into me
[1:15:54] amen so so those things are walking
[1:15:56] around making people better amen
[1:15:58] what those things cause me to do is is
[1:16:01] understand
[1:16:02] even one person that could change
[1:16:04] somebody's heart
[1:16:06] and that's numb but the man jesus christ
[1:16:08] say man
[1:16:10] we could march we could boycott we do
[1:16:12] all kinds of stuff ain't one person out
[1:16:14] there that can change
[1:16:15] hearts hallelujah how did i know he
[1:16:17] could change hearts because he changed
[1:16:19] my heart
[1:16:20] how do i know he could change hearts
[1:16:22] because he could change your heart amen
[1:16:24] if the world ever wanted an answer to
[1:16:26] the things that's going on in it
[1:16:28] it don't matter who you vote in or who
[1:16:30] you vote out but if you could elect
[1:16:32] jesus over your life in 2020 i promise
[1:16:36] you it will make
[1:16:37] all the difference in your life
[1:16:39] yesterday today
[1:16:40] and forever but what happened is
[1:16:43] distractions get people
[1:16:45] focused on other things where really we
[1:16:47] need to be getting back to the world of
[1:16:49] god amen to the word of god because the
[1:16:51] end of all things at hand
[1:16:55] you've got to have further charity one
[1:16:57] for another monster cells man
[1:17:00] and i understand that's not some
[1:17:02] something that everybody can attain
[1:17:04] because the prophet also shows us that
[1:17:07] love is a capstone revelation amen
[1:17:10] it's a simple concept but to move all
[1:17:13] the way to it eight minutes at the top
[1:17:14] of the parody
[1:17:15] you got to get through it through the
[1:17:16] holy spirit it's a capstone revelation
[1:17:20] and at the same time he told us we can't
[1:17:22] get where we're going without
[1:17:23] it even you know we have to show that
[1:17:27] forever agape man amongst ourselves
[1:17:31] and what happens is what you'll find out
[1:17:33] is that fervent agape love is not a weak
[1:17:36] love
[1:17:37] it's not a love of me and you buddy
[1:17:39] buddy today and then we fall out
[1:17:40] tomorrow amen but
[1:17:42] even how it says in first corinthians it
[1:17:44] man
[1:17:45] that love bears all things it believes
[1:17:47] all things
[1:17:48] hopes for all things endures all things
[1:17:50] amen that fervent charity understands
[1:17:52] shoulder to shoulder amen
[1:17:54] even at the end of this scripture it
[1:17:56] talks about how for
[1:17:57] charity for agape it should be able to
[1:18:00] cover
[1:18:00] the multitude of sins
[1:18:04] it makes me overlook your shortcomings
[1:18:06] and instead of me criticize you for your
[1:18:08] shortcomings i'ma pray for you man
[1:18:10] cause i'm supposed to be watching in the
[1:18:11] prayer man
[1:18:13] we can't get where we going without this
[1:18:15] capstone revelation
[1:18:16] man the prophet of god i mean he already
[1:18:19] told us that we won't be able
[1:18:21] to get in without amen
[1:18:24] what that perfect love does is it comes
[1:18:26] in
[1:18:27] it stabilizes you in a time where
[1:18:30] everybody is so unstable i mean in a
[1:18:32] time where
[1:18:33] where people are confused or maybe
[1:18:35] people are depressed and downtrodden
[1:18:37] amen
[1:18:38] what it's done is it provided us with
[1:18:40] some stability amen
[1:18:42] but brown he said when perfect love is
[1:18:44] coming to your heart
[1:18:46] all the demons in hell will never be
[1:18:48] able to upset it
[1:18:50] think about that now there's a lot of
[1:18:51] demons in hell but if perfect
[1:18:54] love is in your heart all the demons in
[1:18:57] hell won't be able to upset it
[1:19:00] now i'm not telling you about you
[1:19:01] getting upset over different things that
[1:19:02] go on in your life i mean show things
[1:19:04] have we human in me
[1:19:05] but i'm talking about that perfect love
[1:19:07] that you have in your heart one towards
[1:19:08] another
[1:19:09] i'm talking about that perfect love that
[1:19:10] you have in your heart towards the
[1:19:12] things of almighty god
[1:19:13] towards the things that's defending this
[1:19:15] message amen
[1:19:16] if you got it the right way it don't
[1:19:19] matter
[1:19:20] what the enemy tries to put against you
[1:19:23] you'll be able to stand in it amen
[1:19:25] and those things will never be able to
[1:19:27] upset what the kingdom of god has
[1:19:29] already established
[1:19:31] now is the time sinks for us to stay
[1:19:33] fervent with this message
[1:19:36] now is the time for us to stay
[1:19:38] enthusiastic
[1:19:39] with this message man it's time for us
[1:19:41] to be enthusiastic when it comes to the
[1:19:44] things of god amen
[1:19:45] fervent amen hot burning glowing
[1:19:48] we're not going back in the ladder to
[1:19:50] see it well it was a lukewarmness amen
[1:19:53] where people have a form of godliness
[1:19:56] but they're denying the power they help
[1:19:57] god has called these people to be
[1:19:59] fervently man
[1:20:01] hallelujah musicians y'all can come up
[1:20:03] this morning we ain't gonna be all
[1:20:04] morning amen
[1:20:06] the lord sent the example he said love
[1:20:09] one another as i have loved you
[1:20:10] that's a high example that's a heavy
[1:20:13] example but nevertheless
[1:20:14] the lord will never lay anything out
[1:20:16] that his people aren't able to walk into
[1:20:19] it man
[1:20:21] love one another as i have loved you
[1:20:22] amen that's our example amen
[1:20:25] and he said by this well all men know
[1:20:27] that you are my disciples
[1:20:29] now how well you know the seals book but
[1:20:31] that's very important inside you need to
[1:20:32] know what's going on amen
[1:20:34] but they'll know that you are one of his
[1:20:35] disciples if you can show love one for
[1:20:38] another
[1:20:40] but how you treat your fellow flock
[1:20:42] right here amen
[1:20:43] by how you treat the believers amen
[1:20:45] that's even at the different churches
[1:20:48] that's our love test and we want to make
[1:20:50] sure that we passing
[1:20:51] the love test man i'm gonna read a
[1:20:54] little piece too yeah the first
[1:20:55] corinthians 11
[1:20:57] because it's hard to fully talk about
[1:20:58] amen it's basic scripture but
[1:21:00] at the same time first corinthians 13
[1:21:02] i'm sorry amen
[1:21:04] it's basic scripture but at the same
[1:21:06] time you know sometimes we we have to
[1:21:07] look at those
[1:21:08] basic scriptures to remember exactly
[1:21:10] what we have amen
[1:21:11] first corinthians the 13th chapter in
[1:21:13] the first verse he said though i speak
[1:21:15] with the tongues of men
[1:21:17] and of angels and have not charity
[1:21:21] man i become as a sounding brass or
[1:21:24] tinkling symbol
[1:21:25] i speak with tongues and if i don't have
[1:21:27] any love
[1:21:28] uh it's not much to me he said and
[1:21:30] though i have to get the prophecy of it
[1:21:32] and understand all mysteries now
[1:21:35] almighty god came through revelation 10
[1:21:37] and 7 amen to reveal all these mysteries
[1:21:40] to us at the end time
[1:21:41] so i would think that somebody that has
[1:21:43] all understanding of all mysteries
[1:21:45] they've been and somebody that has the
[1:21:46] gift of prophecy
[1:21:48] i would esteem that person to be very
[1:21:50] high up on the totem pole
[1:21:52] because understanding all ministries is
[1:21:54] a very important thing
[1:21:56] but here the scripture says and though i
[1:21:57] had to give a prophecy
[1:21:59] and understand our mysteries and all
[1:22:01] knowledge
[1:22:02] and though i could have all faith so
[1:22:05] that i could remove
[1:22:06] mountains amen and i like that gift of
[1:22:09] faith for me hallelujah
[1:22:10] you get linked up to somebody that has a
[1:22:12] gift of faith y'all can go ask the way
[1:22:14] he's at
[1:22:15] and kick him off the problem that
[1:22:16] belongs to believers but nevertheless
[1:22:18] the scripture says you can have
[1:22:20] all of that amen and still not have love
[1:22:23] and it don't say that you halfway it
[1:22:25] says you are nothing
[1:22:30] all mysteries all my all knowledge
[1:22:34] all faith but no charity will make you
[1:22:37] nothing amen
[1:22:39] when you read on further down into the
[1:22:41] scripture a minute
[1:22:43] it talks about how it's going to get to
[1:22:45] a point amen and the eighth verse that
[1:22:46] says
[1:22:46] cherish he never failed if amen
[1:22:50] charity never faileth but whether they
[1:22:53] be prophecies
[1:22:54] they shall fail whether there be tongues
[1:22:56] they shall cease
[1:22:58] whether there be knowledge it shall
[1:23:00] vanish away
[1:23:01] but i'm here to tell you this morning
[1:23:03] saints you keep that very charity
[1:23:05] amongst yourself
[1:23:06] in the midst of the end time and that's
[1:23:09] what's going to carry you all away
[1:23:11] your walk is going to be different from
[1:23:13] the rest of this world
[1:23:15] your talk is going to be different from
[1:23:16] even the rest of the church world out
[1:23:18] there
[1:23:19] because god didn't just call you to any
[1:23:21] kind of love
[1:23:22] but he calls you to agape loving his
[1:23:24] hour
[1:23:25] and that's a divine love because we are
[1:23:28] divine
[1:23:28] people walking in maturity showing that
[1:23:32] we adopt the sons and daughters of god
[1:23:33] amen
[1:23:35] i'm gonna read this quote to you amen
[1:23:36] and then we'll turn over to brother
[1:23:38] jason man
[1:23:40] from beyond the curtain of time 1961
[1:23:42] brother branham said
[1:23:44] he said i'm convinced i'm more convinced
[1:23:47] than
[1:23:48] ever in my life that it will take
[1:23:51] perfect love to enter that place there
[1:23:54] was no jealousy
[1:23:55] no tiredness no sickness no old age
[1:23:59] no death oh god in a year where death
[1:24:01] been all around us
[1:24:03] death is finally defeated only supreme
[1:24:06] beauty and joy
[1:24:07] whatever you do lay aside everything
[1:24:10] else until you get perfect love
[1:24:14] get to where you can love everybody even
[1:24:17] every enemy
[1:24:18] no matter if the plane is rocking come
[1:24:20] on the plane is rocking right now
[1:24:22] no matter if the plane is rocking the
[1:24:24] lightning is flashing
[1:24:26] or the guns and the enemy are upon you
[1:24:28] these things do
[1:24:30] not matter get perfect love
[1:24:33] that's what he said even don't get
[1:24:36] caught up in the distraction saints
[1:24:38] these things do not matter the
[1:24:41] end of all things is at hand
[1:24:45] have fervent charity above all else have
[1:24:47] fervent charity amongst yourselves amen
[1:24:49] how many love the lord this morning
[1:24:52] according to god how many love one
[1:24:53] another this morning man
[1:24:55] how many want to be able to manifest
[1:24:56] that agape love one to another amen
[1:24:59] to your past amen to your brothers and
[1:25:02] sisters
[1:25:02] to your believers amen even when people
[1:25:06] meet you there
[1:25:06] they'll have to recognize that you're
[1:25:08] one of his disciples
[1:25:09] you're one of the disciples of christ
[1:25:11] because i recognize there's something
[1:25:12] different about you hallelujah glory to

[1:32:17] and i got to make every minute count
[1:32:18] that's right
[1:32:20] i don't have time for any more uh
[1:32:23] inefficiency
[1:32:24] in my walk for the lord and then when i
[1:32:27] got thinking about that
[1:32:28] as brother maurice was ministering i
[1:32:30] thought you know something friends
[1:32:32] because of the age that we live in
[1:32:34] i'm here to tell you you're all racing
[1:32:36] time
[1:32:37] we're all racing time there is not
[1:32:41] much time left the world is falling
[1:32:44] apart and i thought about this brother
[1:32:45] maurice i thought that
[1:32:47] you know people who are um what would we
[1:32:51] say
[1:32:51] maybe uh i was even trying to figure out
[1:32:53] the best word people who are dispensers
[1:32:55] are people who spread
[1:32:59] uh agape love are the essential
[1:33:02] personnel
[1:33:03] wow they are the essential business that
[1:33:05] this world needs
[1:33:07] is people who are spreading
[1:33:09] [Music]
[1:33:11] agape love are the essential workers
[1:33:14] of today now you might think that that's
[1:33:17] just kind of
[1:33:19] you know a nice catchy thing to say but
[1:33:21] do you realize
[1:33:22] friends brother maurice was talking
[1:33:24] about the only thing that'll
[1:33:26] settle you and stabilize you is god's
[1:33:28] word
[1:33:29] is christ it won't matter about how you
[1:33:31] feel politically or how you feel
[1:33:33] socially or whatever education
[1:33:34] the only thing that will settle you and
[1:33:37] ground you and give you faith and give
[1:33:38] you courage
[1:33:40] is god's word because the whole world
[1:33:43] you know proof i was just reading a
[1:33:44] headline this morning
[1:33:46] brother maurice that that that in the
[1:33:49] island nation of japan they are like
[1:33:53] a go society i mean it's pedal to the
[1:33:55] metal
[1:33:56] it's in it's in their culture from
[1:33:58] earliest childhood
[1:33:59] you're taught to hit it and go hard all
[1:34:02] the time
[1:34:03] and when covid hit there and that island
[1:34:06] nation
[1:34:07] locked down and everybody had to stay
[1:34:10] home
[1:34:11] their suicide rate is several times
[1:34:14] higher
[1:34:14] than their coveted death rate covet
[1:34:18] death's rate are so many thousands in
[1:34:20] suicides
[1:34:21] from people suddenly they can't go
[1:34:23] anymore they have to stay home and they
[1:34:25] don't know what to do with themselves
[1:34:26] and they're literally
[1:34:28] checking out i think it was four or five
[1:34:30] times at a higher rate
[1:34:32] than covet is even killing people over
[1:34:34] there
[1:34:35] and i just thought wow when your life is
[1:34:37] that
[1:34:38] no wonder suddenly you don't have that
[1:34:40] anymore you can't cope
[1:34:41] i'm glad i got something that i can cope
[1:34:44] doesn't matter what comes our way the
[1:34:46] world is falling apart
[1:34:47] we have the coping mechanism amen
[1:34:51] and that is the word of god which is the
[1:34:54] life of god which gives us the love of
[1:34:56] god
[1:34:57] oh my how many want to be essential
[1:34:59] workers
[1:35:01] oh i thought what a statement brother
[1:35:03] maurice was making and encouraging us
[1:35:05] you know we ain't never been in a global
[1:35:07] pandemic

[1:36:23] oh
[1:36:24] let me make an announcement dad stand by
[1:36:26] sister
[1:36:27] uh one of the things that we were going
[1:36:29] to do is
[1:36:30] next weekend we're going to have our
[1:36:33] little church get together we can't
[1:36:35] really call it a harvest fest
[1:36:36] because it just has the more
[1:36:40] the more we got into the logistics of
[1:36:41] trying to pull it off
[1:36:43] under the situation we're in it just
[1:36:45] became impossible
[1:36:47] we are hoping weather permitting to have
[1:36:50] a big
[1:36:50] thing here on the church grounds on
[1:36:52] saturday but
[1:36:53] uh we're gonna have you know we'll have
[1:36:55] all the food and all the fellowship the
[1:36:57] campfires and the games and the
[1:36:58] activities
[1:36:59] but uh it's still going to be way scaled
[1:37:02] down but we are going to have a lot of
[1:37:04] good time and so we want you to come
[1:37:06] hopefully whether we'll be permitting
[1:37:08] brother richie's going to come brother
[1:37:09] richie douglas
[1:37:10] good friend of mine i've wanted him to
[1:37:12] come for so long sat
[1:37:13] now we were going to have a friday night
[1:37:16] um and do a communion service have like
[1:37:18] a little abbreviated service and have a
[1:37:19] communion we can't do the foot washing
[1:37:21] because that's
[1:37:22] a little too close trying to do that in
[1:37:23] the fellowship hall and a little too
[1:37:25] close in proximity we're going to
[1:37:27] not do that right now but what we've
[1:37:29] decided to do is instead of doing that
[1:37:31] friday we're just going to have our
[1:37:32] regular wednesday night service this
[1:37:35] this week so on our regular wednesday
[1:37:37] night service brother richie won't be
[1:37:38] here
[1:37:39] myself for the matter i think jd won't
[1:37:41] be back in time yet myself or brother
[1:37:43] matt will take the wednesday service
[1:37:45] we'll abbreviate it a little bit and
[1:37:46] then have the lord supper at the end of
[1:37:48] that i've wanted to do that for a while
[1:37:51] and uh and then saturday brother richie
[1:37:53] will be the campfire
[1:37:55] preacher we'll have a we'll have our big
[1:37:58] campfire here we're gonna have to build
[1:37:59] it up big because it's gonna be cold
[1:38:01] amen and brother richie is going to uh
[1:38:03] maybe if the lord
[1:38:05] he we talked about it and if the lord is
[1:38:08] agreeable
[1:38:09] brother richie's going to you know give
[1:38:10] mainly just give his testimony and i'm
[1:38:12] here to tell you
[1:38:14] it is amazing it is powerful
[1:38:17] i'm hoping that every member of our
[1:38:20] senior youth
[1:38:21] will be there brother jason demars is
[1:38:23] going to take the younger
[1:38:24] the junior youth the class that he has
[1:38:26] in his home
[1:38:27] and he's going to go and have a
[1:38:29] different fire and he's going to do a
[1:38:30] little bible study with them
[1:38:32] at a different little campfire but we'll
[1:38:33] be out here gathered around
[1:38:35] as soon as it gets dark we're probably
[1:38:37] going to we're going to delay
[1:38:39] even probably we'll send out some
[1:38:41] announcements for the time frames
[1:38:42] probably somewhere around two to
[1:38:44] seven thirty two to eight uh and then
[1:38:46] we'll break and then brother rich he'll
[1:38:48] be back here sunday morning
[1:38:49] and then it'll be no holds barred we'll
[1:38:51] take all the
[1:38:52] restraints off of him and let him preach
[1:38:54] for us he is a wonderful brother
[1:38:56] um it's hard to describe brother richie
[1:38:59] if you've never met him but i promise
[1:39:00] you never meet anybody like him
[1:39:02] and you will like him he is adorable
[1:39:05] just a gigantic
[1:39:06] man but a teddy bear of a man who god
[1:39:09] has completely
[1:39:10] the lord wrecked his whole life he was
[1:39:12] like he was the
[1:39:13] he was a terror to the county where he
[1:39:17] lived
[1:39:18] i mean i think i think all law
[1:39:20] enforcement had a jubilee
[1:39:22] when the lord got a hold of his life i
[1:39:24] think they held a big church service
[1:39:25] just to
[1:39:26] praise the lord that that richie douglas
[1:39:28] gave his heart to the lord he was pretty
[1:39:30] rough
[1:39:31] so now you would never know you meet him
[1:39:33] now you would never know he had that
[1:39:35] kind of life
[1:39:36] so bring your teenagers bring your
[1:39:38] children and we're going to gather them
[1:39:39] around and hear brother richie pour his
[1:39:41] heart out
[1:39:42] at the campfire saturday but this
[1:39:44] wednesday we'll have
[1:39:47] kind of an abbreviated service and then
[1:39:48] the lord's supper so we haven't got to
[1:39:50] take that in quite a while
[1:39:52] and so make sure that you prepare your
[1:39:54] hearts for that amen
[1:39:56] all right i think that was all my
[1:39:57] announcements brother charles
[1:40:01] i'm going to send out an announcement
[1:40:02] when we have it all worked out and uh
[1:40:04] got to talk to the teams that are
[1:40:06] working on all that it looks like
[1:40:08] probably two to eight
[1:40:10] somewhere in that window to 2pm in the
[1:40:13] afternoon
[1:40:13] to maybe 8 o'clock that night so we are
[1:40:16] going to have all the
[1:40:17] different activities out there be plenty
[1:40:19] to do and fellowship and food
[1:40:22] and so we're looking for that then we'll
[1:40:23] have a campfire service as soon as it
[1:40:24] gets dark which don't take long
[1:40:26] it's dark what by 5 30 and so
[1:40:29] hopefully y'all be praying the lord has
[1:40:31] always given us a perfect weather
[1:40:34] and there's a little bit of a threat so
[1:40:36] we're gonna have to be praying
[1:40:37] now if we get to saturday and it ain't
[1:40:39] good weather i'm gonna know y'all didn't
[1:40:40] pray
[1:40:42] you'll say well no you didn't pray
[1:40:44] brother jason so we might all we're all
[1:40:46] under a little bit of pressure to get a
[1:40:47] hold of the lord and ask him for
[1:40:49] some good weather if not hey we'll bring
[1:40:50] it all in here we'll we'll eat under the
[1:40:52] canopy and in the fellowship paul we'll
[1:40:54] still have
[1:40:55] a good time we'll bring brother richie
[1:40:57] in here where it'll be warm and dry and
[1:40:58] let him give his testimony to us so
[1:41:00] we'll have a way to do it
[1:41:02] because it's here on the church grounds
[1:41:04] and that's kind of one of the advantages
[1:41:05] if you get rained out
[1:41:06] you just come inside so amen amen hold
[1:41:09] to god's unchanging hand god bless your
[1:41:11] friends
[1:41:12] we love you in the lord you're dismissed
[1:41:14] in jesus name
