[19:17] and um travis who was gonna do sunday
[19:20] school
[19:20] ended up having to work in the sound
[19:21] booth and and i knew he was going to
[19:24] have to
[19:25] and i thought well i'll take sunday
[19:26] school then i thought what am i going to
[19:27] do for a sunday school lesson
[19:29] and the only thing i could think of was
[19:31] i want to do a song
[19:32] and um practice it and hopefully sing
[19:35] really soon it's just a hymn that we
[19:37] would all know

[19:42] get sing we'll sing it in sunday school
[19:44] so we jumped in and me and the kids we
[19:47] practiced it and just kind of went

[19:53] last night but it just didn't come up
[19:54] and i hadn't talked to the kids yet and
[19:56] um so as we're practicing tony comes by
[19:58] the fellowship hall and he sticks ahead

[20:05] so i haven't had a bad dream about it
[20:06] last night that the dog was barking and
[20:08] wrote the song but um so um you all know
[20:11] the song and uh
[20:13] just um this was just

[25:07] to make concerning our harvest gathering
[25:09] and
[25:09] explain a little bit about the details
[25:12] uh
[25:13] first thing as i gave you uh on the uh
[25:16] church chat was that it is said to be
[25:18] saturday the 14th
[25:20] uh but i've also had it on my heart to
[25:22] do it a little bit different this year
[25:24] and
[25:24] as it as it stands almost everything is
[25:28] different this year
[25:29] and so um amen brother manuel says to
[25:32] carol happy to have you all here with us
[25:34] today
[25:35] um so what we're what i'm about to
[25:38] announce is kind of you can't
[25:39] take it anywhere see it's kind of top
[25:41] secret so that's why we have it on the
[25:43] internet
[25:43] so but it's okay i actually am going to
[25:46] make the announcement
[25:47] that um you know because of the
[25:50] situation that we have
[25:52] during the pandemic we're not going to
[25:54] do it like we normally
[25:56] do it normally it's it's over the top
[25:59] way large way big big lots of activity
[26:02] lots of things going on
[26:04] we're going to first have it here on the
[26:07] church grounds
[26:09] and we're going to uh scale it back
[26:12] uh quite a bit we're still going to have
[26:14] activities
[26:15] um you know but uh and i may i haven't
[26:18] it's hard for me to resist getting
[26:20] something for the kids to play on
[26:21] so i may put a slide up over here and by
[26:24] the way i sure enjoyed that song
[26:26] today that they did i vote for sarah
[26:29] putting that together every sunday
[26:33] only me every sunday she's standing
[26:35] behind you she can see your hands amen
[26:36] amen
[26:38] amen thank you sister sarah that was
[26:43] fantastic and so i just
[26:46] i love little children and so i love to
[26:48] see them having a good time love to see
[26:50] them worshiping the lord
[26:52] and so we may we may put that up i've
[26:55] given rachel uh
[26:56] if she wants to pursue that permission
[26:58] to do and we're still going to have
[27:00] other
[27:00] activities here i think the uh they'll
[27:04] they'll have the octa ball out and the
[27:05] corn toss and the ping pong tables and
[27:07] and all that kind of stuff and we'll
[27:09] have we'll have the fire
[27:10] and the lights and the eating and the of
[27:13] course we're gonna have the eating
[27:14] absolutely nobody would come if we
[27:16] didn't do that so
[27:18] and we're gonna have lots of fellowship
[27:20] and uh but it will be on a smaller scale
[27:23] so we're not even going to call it a
[27:24] harvest fest this year
[27:26] because of the scaled-down version we're
[27:28] just going to call it our harvest
[27:29] gathering
[27:30] and i've had it on my heart
[27:33] for weeks and just been secretly praying
[27:36] i haven't even
[27:37] only sister debbie only heard about this
[27:39] when i told rachel about it
[27:41] just the other day sister rachel's
[27:43] heading up our the teams and so
[27:45] any sisters that want to help out please
[27:48] see sister rachel about
[27:50] volunteering we're going to have we're
[27:52] going to do the food a certain way that
[27:53] we've discussed
[27:55] but i've also had it on my heart that
[27:58] you know the pandemic friends just if i
[28:01] speak to you from my heart
[28:03] for some it has taken quite a bit from
[28:05] us
[28:06] um and you know we were under
[28:08] restrictions for our church and we
[28:10] we first you know we were the skeleton
[28:13] crew a preacher of
[28:14] one musician and two booth personnel
[28:17] then we went to
[28:18] um the silly alphabet system we had to
[28:21] do it because
[28:22] i didn't never like it but we had to do
[28:24] it because of the
[28:26] it only had one purpose behind it was
[28:28] that we could not socially distance
[28:31] the building isn't big enough and so we
[28:33] couldn't socially distance having
[28:35] everybody here
[28:36] so because we felt compelled in the word
[28:39] of god
[28:39] to follow the restriction that our local
[28:43] city fathers had placed on us and i felt
[28:45] that i felt that in my heart as a
[28:47] servant of the lord
[28:48] i didn't make that decision lightly i
[28:50] didn't make it arbitrarily
[28:52] these decisions have been made with the
[28:54] entire board of elders deacons and
[28:56] trustees
[28:57] and we've and the ministry team so but
[29:00] through a lot of prayer i felt compelled
[29:02] by god's word and by things brother
[29:03] branham said
[29:04] to uh follow those restrictions they've
[29:07] since been
[29:08] relaxed and now we're able to meet uh
[29:10] together we do still
[29:12] ask and expect you to comply
[29:15] with wearing your mask coming into your
[29:17] seat and then leaving
[29:19] to go back out you'll notice even
[29:22] brother luther will wear one coming up
[29:24] here
[29:25] and we've got the three back rows
[29:27] reserved for people who wish to wear
[29:28] their mask
[29:29] throughout the service and there are
[29:30] people who do that's perfect there are
[29:32] people who are
[29:34] you know concerned about that and i have
[29:37] nothing at all negative say about that i
[29:39] think it is a concerning thing people
[29:41] are getting sick
[29:42] message believers are dying sister seal
[29:44] is on a ventilator right now
[29:46] and thankfully thankfully to the lord
[29:48] we're very grateful
[29:50] we're one of the few churches that this
[29:52] is true about so it's just god's grace
[29:54] but
[29:55] but we have no known infection from
[29:58] coming to church
[29:59] everyone that has got it was traveling
[30:00] away and got it while they were away
[30:03] or perhaps in a business somewhere we've
[30:05] we've not found any contact tracing that
[30:08] would lead us to think anyone caught it
[30:10] from here
[30:11] and we have installed new air
[30:14] quality systems to deal with pathogens
[30:17] of all kind
[30:18] and so the trustees we announced that
[30:20] last week so we've been doing good
[30:23] and we want to keep it that way so
[30:25] remember
[30:26] friends that the whole thing about
[30:28] asking you to wear a mask coming in or
[30:30] going out
[30:31] is because you're going to pass by
[30:32] people who
[30:34] who who have a concern you know about
[30:37] the mask and
[30:38] remember that the science indicates
[30:42] that the mask doesn't as much
[30:45] keep you from catching it as it as it
[30:48] more keeps you
[30:49] if you happen to have it and don't know
[30:52] it it helps prevent you from spreading
[30:54] it
[30:55] so that's why it's so important when you
[30:57] walk in because you're going to walk
[30:58] past
[30:58] people on the back row who are there
[31:02] because they have those concerns and
[31:04] want to wear a mask and so
[31:05] we're just asking you to follow that
[31:08] strictly
[31:09] remember i think that brother jason
[31:11] sunday school this morning was
[31:12] astonishing
[31:14] my wife and i were having that
[31:15] conversation this morning and i
[31:18] told brother jd in the back i said you
[31:20] know we were we were talking about what
[31:22] you know love versus selfishness and
[31:24] self-centeredness and i think
[31:26] i learned so much about brother jason
[31:28] breaking down that it's more than just
[31:30] agape love it's more than just the love
[31:32] of god that comes by the new birth
[31:34] there is a human interactive love as
[31:36] brother jason was breaking out
[31:38] and and and in order for the church to
[31:40] function according to the way
[31:42] god desires it to function all three of
[31:45] those
[31:45] forms of love need to be in need to be
[31:48] moving
[31:49] so you you've got to remember friends
[31:51] that that self-centeredness
[31:54] and selfishness uh
[31:57] when you're self-centered i want to tell
[31:59] you something what happens
[32:01] it creates a self-blindness and a
[32:04] self-deafness and a self-numbness
[32:07] to the effects of what you do in your
[32:10] life
[32:11] and too often times in an absence of the
[32:14] right kind of love
[32:15] and tender heartedness toward one
[32:17] another as the bible says
[32:19] we get self-centered and we we we tend
[32:21] to say
[32:22] you know i don't care what people think
[32:26] but just understand this please that
[32:28] just because you might not care
[32:30] that doesn't keep it from happening that
[32:33] it's still going to happen the effects
[32:35] of what you do are still going to affect
[32:37] people around you
[32:38] so you can you cannot care all day long
[32:40] that's not going to change the reality
[32:42] of what it's going to cause and so
[32:44] because that we are commanded
[32:46] you know to be kind-hearted
[32:48] tenderhearted one toward another kindly
[32:50] affection
[32:51] uh toward one another we ask that you
[32:54] for the sake of others follow these
[32:56] coveted rules we have been
[32:58] coveted free as far as anyone
[33:00] contracting it here
[33:02] in church and we would like to keep it
[33:04] that way
[33:05] there are other churches right now
[33:07] brother luke gibson had several cases of
[33:09] covet and
[33:10] some other illnesses that were also
[33:12] conspiring and so they've actually
[33:14] closed their services other churches
[33:16] have had to do that
[33:17] we've been we've managed to keep going
[33:20] uh
[33:20] even albeit limited at times but uh we
[33:24] we want to really there the nation is
[33:27] in a uh in an increase right now in 32
[33:30] states and i'm not talking about
[33:31] positive tests that's just because
[33:33] they're testing more but
[33:34] hospitalizations
[33:36] and deaths are up south carolina has
[33:39] about a 92.1 percent
[33:41] death rate right now uh fortunately
[33:44] thank be thanks be to god beaufort
[33:46] county
[33:47] is uh very low right now um very low
[33:51] in fact is it has some of the when i i
[33:53] was looking with the ministry team
[33:55] yesterday
[33:56] at the graphs from dhec and on their
[33:59] seven to 14 day window the seven
[34:01] past and the seven i think they do seven
[34:03] past and seven
[34:04] forecast uh they say right now beaufort
[34:07] county
[34:08] is quite low so i'm glad i'm thankful to
[34:11] the lord for that
[34:13] and so um jasper county was was one
[34:16] notch above but even still it was only
[34:18] moderate so
[34:19] we're thankful to the lord that he's
[34:21] watching over us i think maybe our
[34:23] coastal
[34:24] coastal breeze kind of helps that a
[34:25] little bit so there's advantages to
[34:27] living near the ocean
[34:29] amen we don't call it a beach here
[34:31] brother man you'll call it the coast
[34:32] the ocean amen so if you if you go to
[34:36] the coast
[34:37] or to the ocean you know you're fine
[34:40] don't be telling people you go to the
[34:41] beach
[34:41] but i'm just kidding i'm totally kidding
[34:45] i don't doesn't matter whatever to me
[34:47] what you call it amen
[34:49] you're going to be a christian wherever
[34:50] you go right
[34:52] so praise the lord and uh so we're going
[34:55] to be doing
[34:56] our harvest gathering on saturday the
[34:59] 14th and
[35:01] i i've had it on my heart that you know
[35:04] i would i would i
[35:05] we've wanted to try to figure out how to
[35:06] run a meeting of course that's
[35:08] wow how do you do that during a pandemic
[35:10] and all meetings have been canceled this
[35:12] entire year
[35:13] uh even some of the biggest meetings
[35:15] that we've been accustomed to for 40
[35:17] years or more
[35:18] had to be set aside for 2020.
[35:21] so what we're going to do is we're going
[35:24] to have
[35:25] i'm going to take the wednesday prior uh
[35:28] to that saturday that's me thank you
[35:31] uh yes sir correct and that that
[35:34] wednesday
[35:35] we're going to move that wednesday the
[35:37] 11th
[35:38] and i will i will let you know my final
[35:41] decision but my
[35:42] my tentative plan is to move it to
[35:44] thursday the 12th
[35:46] because i would like to have a couple of
[35:48] services
[35:49] leading up to our harvest gathering you
[35:52] know a revival
[35:53] time a rededication time i think the
[35:56] pandemic has taken something from us
[35:58] and i think i would like to see our
[36:00] hearts brought back into rededication
[36:03] to the lord and i appreciate all the
[36:05] dedication i see
[36:06] you're a marvelous group you've survived
[36:08] well during this
[36:09] unsettling time i think we're doing
[36:12] wonderful
[36:12] but i also feel it in my own heart and
[36:15] in your heart
[36:16] and and from the lord's heart i think i
[36:18] would like to see a time
[36:20] of reconsecration and rededication and
[36:22] because of that we'll have maybe our
[36:24] wednesday night service will be on
[36:25] thursday the 12th
[36:27] so we're just moving it we're not
[36:29] canceling it
[36:32] reading my lips we're not canceling it
[36:35] we're just moving it to thursday and
[36:37] then also i'd like to
[36:39] have on the 13th friday i'd like for us
[36:42] to come back and maybe have an
[36:43] abbreviated service where we
[36:46] have the lord's supper now we won't be
[36:48] able to do foot washing because
[36:49] several reasons logistically the
[36:51] fellowship hall it will be prepared for
[36:54] the harvest festival
[36:55] the harvest gathering the next day so
[36:57] the brothers can't go in there and bulls
[36:59] in a china shop and
[37:01] wreck everything that the sisters have
[37:03] done and
[37:04] imagine that we could get it back in the
[37:06] order they had it in so we're not going
[37:07] to be able to use that
[37:09] plus that would really put some close
[37:11] proximities
[37:12] i think i'd i'd just be better part of
[37:15] wisdom would be not to do that
[37:17] so we'll just have just the communion
[37:19] service
[37:20] just the lord's supper we'll have a
[37:22] little bit of ministry as we do
[37:24] we cut all the song singing short the
[37:26] ministry short
[37:27] and uh and then we have the lord's
[37:29] supper and i think that that thursday
[37:31] which is just our wednesday relocated to
[37:34] thursday
[37:34] and then the 13th friday as a
[37:37] rededication
[37:38] service reconsecration service
[37:41] amen i think that it would be wonderful
[37:44] and
[37:44] i like doing it that way because
[37:46] sometimes people won't come to communion
[37:49] service
[37:50] because they you know because of issues
[37:52] in their mind that they're aware maybe
[37:54] they're not
[37:55] they don't feel like they can take it
[37:58] and it's
[37:58] uh that that can happen i i'm
[38:01] i have nothing disparaging to say i'm
[38:03] glad if your heart feels
[38:05] hesitant but remember that paul's
[38:08] instructions are is to
[38:09] is to consider yourself make your heart
[38:12] right
[38:13] and then take the supper don't just not
[38:16] take it
[38:16] you know that's why friday will be we'll
[38:19] have some preaching
[38:20] to wash you up cleanse your hearts and
[38:22] minds give you an opportunity
[38:25] to re-consecrate your heart and then
[38:27] come and partake of the lord's supper
[38:29] it's a
[38:30] sad case when you see and i'm glad we
[38:33] don't have it
[38:34] very rampant here over the years but i
[38:37] have occasionally seen you know there's
[38:38] certain people and you go
[38:40] 5 10 15 20 years and that person
[38:44] is never at a communion service and
[38:46] that's very sad
[38:47] so you don't want to do that friends
[38:49] that's not why the gospel came
[38:50] that's not why you're a believer that's
[38:52] not why you're a christian you're a
[38:54] christian to be an overcomer
[38:56] so we'll give you a service a little bit
[38:59] of preaching
[39:00] even if it's a shortened version and i
[39:03] have it on my heart to bring a friend of
[39:05] mine down i'm i've texted him to ask him
[39:07] if he's available
[39:08] if he can't do it then we'll just carry
[39:10] it ourselves with the ministry here
[39:12] but i've had it on my heart to bring him
[39:14] in i'm not going to tell you who it is
[39:15] until i can get a confirmation from him
[39:17] but he's a wonderful wonderful friend
[39:21] and um just has a way about him that
[39:25] he will melt your heart and um he's
[39:29] he's he i don't think he's preached in
[39:32] this building maybe he
[39:34] maybe that might stand correction but
[39:35] it's been a long time
[39:37] and he's a very very dear friend of mine
[39:39] and so i think that he
[39:41] he his testimony will be great for our
[39:43] senior youth
[39:45] because this this is the white version
[39:46] of jewel forney i mean
[39:48] raised in the streets was
[39:51] in almost every uni i mean you talking
[39:54] about a
[39:55] uh you know a twofold child of the devil
[39:57] the devil
[39:58] this was this was one of the devil's
[40:00] franchise players
[40:02] and uh you know one of his one of his
[40:04] leading men and
[40:05] god snatched him from the devil amen and
[40:07] now he's a glorious christian
[40:10] and uh he has a powerful testimony that
[40:12] i'd like
[40:13] i thought would be good for dedication
[40:15] and if he can't make it we're definitely
[40:16] going to get him
[40:17] but well i'm just going to tell you who
[40:19] it is so you can help me pray
[40:21] that's brother richie douglas in north
[40:22] carolina good friend of mine
[40:25] since boys and uh he him and his mother
[40:28] and father were great friends to my
[40:29] parents
[40:30] and so his mom's still alive and boy
[40:32] she's their sister jean hey
[40:35] at least 90 yeah and so um
[40:38] i'm sorry to keep taking all your time
[40:39] anthony we'll we'll give you all the
[40:41] time out so don't change anything just
[40:43] carry on
[40:44] um we'll we'll limit the preacher i'll
[40:46] hold my watch up at him if he goes too
[40:48] long
[40:50] i used to see brother eddie do that to
[40:52] me he would he was too slick to just go
[40:54] like that he'd wear his watch upside
[40:56] down
[40:57] and i would notice him just go like he's
[41:00] looking at his hand but i knew what he
[41:01] was doing
[41:03] back i think we maybe have another
[41:04] special and we want to hear
[41:06] back i think we maybe have another
[41:08] special and we want to hear
[41:10] i want to hear what brother matt has
[41:11] today i have had to stand down
[41:14] actually i've stood here too long
[41:15] already i've strained my lower back
[41:17] pretty bad
[41:18] and i was over to see doc meredith
[41:20] yesterday an x-ray and different things
[41:22] everything's fine just uh just some
[41:24] inflammation
[41:25] from an old injury and some arthritis
[41:28] trying to creep in which i call lying
[41:30] devil
[41:31] and uh never gonna sign for that never
[41:33] gonna sign for that
[41:35] uh but uh you know it's my own fault you
[41:37] know i kind of felt it coming and should
[41:39] have took it easy and didn't
[41:41] uh should have continued with my
[41:43] stretching and my
[41:44] core strengthening coulda shoulda woulda
[41:46] isn't that what we always say
[41:48] when we're regretting man i could have i
[41:50] should have um
[41:52] so uh just need to be a little more
[41:54] diligent on keeping my temple
[41:56] uh healthy for the lord's use it's not
[41:58] mine doesn't belong to me and i need to
[41:59] take better care of it
[42:01] so god bless you again
[42:05] we will keep you up to date on our
[42:07] harvest gathering
[42:09] but that's our plans to move the
[42:11] wednesday

[42:45] but brother jd had to cover for me on
[42:46] sunday school and brother matt's
[42:48] covering for me on the service today
[42:49] it'd be too much on my feet
[42:51] and so uh if you see me moving slow

[48:08] word this morning psalms chapter 23
[48:10] we'll just have a
[48:12] one scripture very familiar psalm here
[48:16] but i i just wanted to read this we
[48:19] won't get to
[48:21] psalms 23 right away but we just want to
[48:24] um
[48:26] want to pour out what the lord's put
[48:27] upon our heart you love him this morning
[48:30] amen certainly appreciated all that good
[48:33] worship from the back i could hear and
[48:35] feel amen but we just want to look to
[48:37] his word this morning psalms chapter 23
[48:39] very familiar
[48:41] scripture here the lord is my shepherd
[48:46] i shall not want he maketh me to lie
[48:49] down in green pastures
[48:51] he leadeth me beside the still waters
[48:54] he restoreth my soul he leadeth me in
[48:57] the pas
[48:58] in the paths of righteousness for his
[49:00] name's sake
[49:02] yea though i walk through the valley of
[49:03] the shadow of death
[49:05] i will fear no evil for thou art with me
[49:09] thy rod and thy staff they comfort me
[49:12] thou preparest a table before me in the
[49:16] presence of my
[49:17] enemies thou anoinest my head with oil
[49:21] my cup runeth over surely goodness and
[49:25] mercy
[49:25] shall follow me all the days of my life
[49:29] and i will dwell in the house of the
[49:32] lord
[49:33] forever amen heavenly father we thank
[49:36] you lord for your
[49:38] word this morning that we've read
[49:39] already
[49:41] lord the sunday school that was taught
[49:42] father your word that went forth we
[49:44] believe
[49:45] lord that you're already here amongst us
[49:48] lord and you inhabit the praises of your
[49:50] people
[49:51] lord and we worship you this morning
[49:52] with thanksgiving in our heart lord we
[49:54] have something
[49:56] lord that we can rejoice over for you've
[49:59] done
[49:59] so much for us lord as your children god
[50:02] and so we just ask now that you would
[50:04] come
[50:05] by your spirit lord let not this be just
[50:07] the work of a man
[50:09] lord of the words or the thoughts or
[50:11] things that i've studied or looked at
[50:13] lord but
[50:14] i know you've placed a burden upon my
[50:16] heart now god would you come
[50:18] and quicken your word to the heart of
[50:20] your children lord i pray father it
[50:22] would reach every person in this
[50:23] building
[50:24] lord every person that's streaming those
[50:26] that'll go later maybe and see this lord
[50:28] i pray that your word would
[50:30] hit its mark father may you just move us
[50:33] out of the way lord be with
[50:35] the hearer and the speaker we ask in
[50:37] jesus christ's name
[50:39] amen amen you can be seated this morning
[50:42] i'd like to speak to you on the lord is
[50:45] my shepherd
[50:46] very simple title and we'll get to
[50:49] psalms 23 here in a moment
[50:51] but i'd like to begin here and if you
[50:53] have a bible
[50:54] handy and the brothers on the screen if
[50:56] they'd just be ready i'd like you to
[50:58] look at
[50:58] genesis chapter 17 and we're just going
[51:01] to read one verse
[51:03] and just want to want to begin here
[51:06] with a word that we have perfection
[51:09] and we know that word uh means
[51:12] something uh unattainable is what we
[51:15] feel like when we hear that word
[51:16] perfection uh we automatically think
[51:19] well
[51:19] i'm separated from that because i'm
[51:21] nowhere near perfect
[51:23] and i can never be perfect which is true
[51:25] let's see what the lord says about
[51:27] perfection here in genesis chapter 17.
[51:29] what has begun reading in the first
[51:31] verse
[51:32] i am the almighty god this is god
[51:35] speaking to abraham
[51:36] walk before me and be thou perfect
[51:40] so god gives this commandment to abraham
[51:43] and he says
[51:44] walk before me and be thou perfect he
[51:47] says also and
[51:48] and if you'll just follow me here on the
[51:50] screen in deuteronomy chapter 18 verse
[51:52] 13 he says thou shall be perfect with
[51:56] the lord
[51:57] your god so this is god speaking of the
[51:59] children of israel not only to abraham
[52:01] but he says this to his family also thou
[52:04] shall be perfect
[52:06] with the lord your god uh and and you'll
[52:09] find this
[52:10] laced all the way through the entire old
[52:12] testament and then into the new
[52:14] testament
[52:15] uh and when jesus says unless you're
[52:17] perfection exceeds the pharisees and he
[52:20] begins to talk
[52:21] and and use the example of what we think
[52:23] of when we think of perfection
[52:26] but god looks at perfection so
[52:27] differently than how
[52:29] we look at perfection in our life god
[52:32] even says here and he says and this is
[52:35] david in psalms chapter 101
[52:38] and verse 2 uh and we're just going to
[52:40] go through these i've got a lot of them
[52:42] here before me
[52:43] he says in psalms 101 verse 2 he says i
[52:46] will behave myself
[52:47] wisely this is david a desire he has in
[52:50] his heart
[52:51] he says i'll behave myself wisely in a
[52:54] perfect way
[52:55] oh when will thou come unto me i will
[52:57] walk within my house
[53:00] with a perfect heart and so notice david
[53:02] doesn't say i'll walk perfectly and all
[53:04] my behavior and my conduct and
[53:06] and everything that i do will be perfect
[53:08] we know his life
[53:09] definitely was not perfect and
[53:13] it was a life that was marred and
[53:14] scarred by sin and a lot of failure and
[53:17] a lot of mistakes
[53:19] but david purposes something in his
[53:21] heart and he says i'll walk
[53:23] within my house with a perfect heart
[53:26] we know solomon fell from that perfect
[53:29] from that perfect heart the bible says
[53:32] in first kings chapter 11
[53:34] and he says here in verse 4 first kings
[53:37] 11
[53:38] chapter chapter 11 verse 4 he says his
[53:41] heart speaking of solomon here
[53:44] he says his heart was not perfect with
[53:46] the lord his god
[53:49] he turned that his wives turned away his
[53:50] heart after the gods his heart was not
[53:52] perfect with the lord his god
[53:54] as was the heart of david
[53:57] his father so notice the correlation
[54:00] that god makes
[54:01] for perfection he doesn't point to
[54:04] conduct he doesn't point to
[54:06] behavior but he says a heart that's
[54:09] perfect before me
[54:10] david said i'll walk with a perfect
[54:13] heart in my house
[54:14] solomon we know the bible says he didn't
[54:16] walk it wasn't pointing to solomon's
[54:18] mistakes
[54:19] or his failures but actually something
[54:21] had happened
[54:22] in solomon's heart and the bible says
[54:26] he says he he didn't walk like david his
[54:28] father with a perfect
[54:30] heart he went not fully after the lord
[54:33] as david his father uh he says in
[54:36] matthew chapter 5
[54:38] verse 48 uh this is the lord come
[54:41] in the new testament this is jesus
[54:43] speaking and he says
[54:44] be ye therefore perfect matthew 5 48 be
[54:48] ye therefore
[54:49] perfect with the lord uh uh
[54:52] let me back up be you there for perfect
[54:54] even as your father
[54:56] which is in heaven is perfect paul
[54:58] speaks of this
[54:59] and he says and we don't have to turn
[55:01] but he says i have a desire
[55:04] that i may present you uh
[55:07] every one of you perfect chased spotless
[55:10] without spot without blemish
[55:12] without wrinkle without any such thing
[55:14] and
[55:15] he says in colossians 1 28 he says that
[55:17] we may present
[55:18] every man perfect in christ
[55:22] jesus that same exact book of colossians
[55:25] he says
[55:26] in chapter 4 verse 12 that you may stand
[55:29] perfect and complete in all the will of
[55:33] god
[55:34] first peter chapter 5 verse 10 this is
[55:38] peter speaking he says but the god
[55:40] of all grace who has called us unto his
[55:43] eternal glory by christ jesus
[55:46] after that you have suffered a while
[55:48] make you
[55:50] perfect here's that word again make you
[55:53] perfect establish strengthen and settle
[55:57] you
[55:58] so what we find is that perfection
[56:01] doesn't mean
[56:02] flawlessness as in the sense of human
[56:06] behavior
[56:07] because we already read that david was a
[56:09] perfect david had a perfect heart before
[56:11] the lord
[56:12] in fact god goes further and says he's a
[56:14] man after my own heart
[56:16] so david was a man full of mistakes full
[56:18] of fear full of failure full of anxiety
[56:21] constantly was a man who was up and down
[56:24] and in and out had many highs and lows
[56:28] but the scripture begins to tell us that
[56:30] there's there's a perfection
[56:32] that doesn't mean that you're perfect in
[56:34] the sense of
[56:35] flawlessness or even sinlessness let me
[56:38] go further and say that you
[56:40] as we preached on wednesday you'll never
[56:42] be sinless in this
[56:44] body because just the fact of being in a
[56:48] carnal body
[56:48] it's already sinful so no matter how
[56:51] much we try we read about monks who
[56:54] uh you know have have self mutilated
[56:56] themselves and tortured themselves
[56:58] looking for perfection we learned about
[57:00] that in the men's breakfast yesterday of
[57:01] a monk who
[57:02] spent 35 years on the top of a needle of
[57:06] a tower and lived there
[57:07] when he couldn't hold himself up anymore
[57:09] he chained himself to a pole just to
[57:12] hold his strength just to hold his body
[57:14] up there it was
[57:14] trying to look for outward perfection it
[57:17] was this
[57:18] this roman 7 law that paul said i
[57:21] realized that
[57:22] within me there's no good thing that is
[57:24] in my flesh
[57:26] and so this this he he begins to speak
[57:29] here and
[57:30] in god we know that we know very well
[57:32] that the bible says that man
[57:34] judges by the outward appearance but god
[57:36] looks upon the heart i know all these
[57:38] things are very
[57:40] elementary for us but i just want to
[57:41] cover them so
[57:43] god judges the heart god looks at the
[57:45] heart he doesn't look at the
[57:46] at the outward appearance as he says to
[57:49] david about saul
[57:50] but he looks at the heart and i believe
[57:53] sometimes we so rejoice in that
[57:55] we say oh thank god he looks at my heart
[57:58] but i think
[57:59] it's a much more weighty matter and in
[58:02] some ways should almost
[58:04] alarm us more
[58:07] are you with me this morning because
[58:09] oftentimes we look at that god looks at
[58:11] the heart as relief that oh well
[58:14] god doesn't look at my outward mistakes
[58:16] and we look and say well i have so many
[58:18] mistakes and i'm
[58:19] i'm just a mess and brother matt god
[58:20] doesn't look at my god doesn't look at
[58:22] my flesh praise god he looks at my heart
[58:24] praise god but do you realize
[58:26] the the seriousness of a god who looks
[58:30] at your heart
[58:34] because in your heart is what's not in
[58:36] your flesh
[58:37] what you can never see in the flesh is
[58:40] the motive of
[58:41] of a person and that motive comes from
[58:43] the word motivation
[58:45] what motivates you we can't we can't
[58:48] judge the intention of a person
[58:50] no all the time by what they do on the
[58:52] outside because sometimes they have very
[58:55] bad there's bad intentions that are
[58:57] covered up by
[58:59] good actions and so god says
[59:03] you know th this is a serious matter
[59:05] it's not a it's not a matter of relief
[59:07] though it is many times for us as a
[59:09] believer to say lord i'm so glad you
[59:11] look at the desire of my heart because
[59:13] god does look at the desire of the heart
[59:15] but the bible says he judges the heart
[59:19] are you here this morning and so what
[59:22] god judges he
[59:24] he sees uns the unseen part of you
[59:28] he sees the part that no one else can
[59:31] he sees the part that no disguise or
[59:34] religion
[59:35] can cover no amount of actions or good
[59:38] behavior can cover because sometimes
[59:41] some of the most corrupt people some of
[59:44] the most corrupted hearts we find
[59:46] are covered by religiosity and what we
[59:49] look at as outward perfection or
[59:51] blessing
[59:53] to stay with me here this morning we're
[59:54] preaching on the lord as my shepherd
[59:56] so david the bible says he was he had a
[59:59] perfect
[1:00:00] heart in first samuel chapter 16.
[1:00:03] in first samuel uh brothers on the
[1:00:04] screen first samuel chapter 16
[1:00:07] and verse 7. i want you to notice what
[1:00:09] the bible says first samuel 16 verse 7
[1:00:11] because this is speaking of david it
[1:00:12] says but the lord
[1:00:14] said unto samuel look not on his
[1:00:16] countenance
[1:00:17] or on the height of a stature speaking
[1:00:19] of david because
[1:00:20] i refuse are speaking of saul because
[1:00:22] i've refused him for the lord seeth not
[1:00:25] as man seeth for man looketh on the
[1:00:28] outward appearance
[1:00:30] but the lord looketh upon the heart
[1:00:34] perfection that word means completeness
[1:00:37] means maturity
[1:00:41] fullness and and the hebrew and the
[1:00:45] greek the definition when you look up
[1:00:46] the definition for
[1:00:48] uh perfection when it says he served the
[1:00:50] lord with the perfect heart
[1:00:52] that the hebrew in greek define it as
[1:00:55] uprightness
[1:00:57] or being without spot or without blemish
[1:01:01] or totally obedient
[1:01:05] it means to finish this is perfection
[1:01:08] perfection means to finish what has been
[1:01:11] started
[1:01:14] so what is god doing when he's
[1:01:15] perfecting me he's
[1:01:17] finishing what he started
[1:01:20] glory it also means a complete
[1:01:24] before performance there shall be a
[1:01:26] completion the bible speaks of
[1:01:28] there shall be a performance of those
[1:01:30] things which he has promised so
[1:01:31] what is god doing by the perfecting of
[1:01:33] the believer by the preaching of the
[1:01:35] word
[1:01:36] uh he he's bringing to completion
[1:01:39] what he started amen
[1:01:42] and it it it means a complete
[1:01:44] performance
[1:01:46] uh wesley calls it a constant obedience
[1:01:49] so you say brother matt what is a
[1:01:50] perfect heart i want to have a perfect
[1:01:52] heart this morning i believe any
[1:01:53] christian
[1:01:54] i don't even have to ask you here this
[1:01:56] morning we would oh identify and say
[1:01:58] lord i want to have a perfect heart
[1:01:59] before you
[1:02:00] i realize i'm not going to have a
[1:02:01] perfect life but i want to have a
[1:02:03] perfect heart
[1:02:04] i want to serve you with a perfect heart
[1:02:06] i want my motives
[1:02:07] that says why david said search me o god
[1:02:10] see if there be any wicked way not we're
[1:02:12] not this wasn't actions not
[1:02:14] wicked how i dress or wicked how i look
[1:02:16] or wicked in my conduct but a wicked
[1:02:19] heart is there a wicked way inside of me
[1:02:22] the lord searches a heart that is
[1:02:24] perfect
[1:02:25] is a heart that can be searched by the
[1:02:28] spirit a heart that can be searched
[1:02:30] is a heart you say the lord searches the
[1:02:32] heart but david speaks of something here
[1:02:35] in first chronicles
[1:02:36] this is first chronicles 28 verse 9.
[1:02:39] i've given you an exercise back there
[1:02:41] but i just i want to display these
[1:02:43] they're so important
[1:02:44] verse chronicles 28 verse 9 the lord
[1:02:48] searcheth all hearts
[1:02:51] lord searcheth all hearts wicked hearts
[1:02:55] righteous hearts rich people's hearts
[1:02:58] poor people's hearts young people's
[1:03:02] hearts
[1:03:02] elderly people's hearts the lord
[1:03:06] searcheth
[1:03:06] all hearts this is very familiar in
[1:03:09] psalms 139
[1:03:11] verse 23 david says search
[1:03:15] me oh god and
[1:03:18] know my heart now this was a this was a
[1:03:21] a plea this is david asking
[1:03:23] search me o god and know my heart
[1:03:28] try me that means the test that means i
[1:03:31] i'm going to put something i'm going to
[1:03:34] put it to it
[1:03:35] i'm going to put it to a test to see is
[1:03:37] it is it going to withstand and this is
[1:03:39] david
[1:03:39] asking saying lord search me know my
[1:03:42] heart
[1:03:43] try me know my thoughts and
[1:03:46] see if there be any wicked way in me
[1:03:51] jeremiah 17 10 you don't have to pull
[1:03:53] this one up
[1:03:54] god said to jeremiah i the lord
[1:03:57] searcheth the hearts uh the the this is
[1:04:01] the hebrew word for for search
[1:04:05] you say because we think of that and
[1:04:06] it's a searching like i'm looking for
[1:04:08] something
[1:04:09] and i'm i'm trying to find something
[1:04:11] that i've lost and we search for it but
[1:04:13] it has a much richer meaning than that
[1:04:15] when david says
[1:04:16] search me oh god and he says and god
[1:04:19] says to jeremiah i
[1:04:20] search the heart the greek word the
[1:04:22] hebrew word there for search means to
[1:04:24] penetrate to examine
[1:04:27] like an examination amen
[1:04:30] so it's a it's a it's a it's a breaking
[1:04:33] up of fallow ground and a
[1:04:35] it's a uncovering what god does when he
[1:04:38] searches the heart
[1:04:39] he peels back all the layers that we put
[1:04:41] on
[1:04:42] he peels back all the layers of our mind
[1:04:44] and all the
[1:04:45] facade that we as christians can have
[1:04:48] many times
[1:04:50] and the lord begins to do deep
[1:04:52] examination he begins to
[1:04:54] to search the inward motive in the
[1:04:56] inward
[1:04:57] being i penetrate examine deeply you
[1:05:00] remember first corinthians
[1:05:02] he says for the spirit searcheth the
[1:05:04] things of god yea
[1:05:05] the deep things of god and so he says
[1:05:09] the spirit what is doing the searching
[1:05:11] the holy spirit is searching
[1:05:13] and and you know what friends let me
[1:05:15] just stop preaching here for a moment
[1:05:17] and just say
[1:05:18] we need this more than we've ever needed
[1:05:21] it before
[1:05:22] and say what do we need brother man we
[1:05:24] need the spirit to search our hearts
[1:05:27] more than ever before every day as
[1:05:30] a believer as as we live in this world
[1:05:32] you say why because
[1:05:34] sin is more deceptive than it's ever
[1:05:36] been before in any other age
[1:05:38] sin is more subtle than it's ever been
[1:05:40] in any other age it's like
[1:05:42] dust that settles down on something and
[1:05:44] you don't notice it at all
[1:05:46] you live in a uh you know without your
[1:05:48] air filters
[1:05:49] in your hvac system and you get dust
[1:05:52] that settles sometimes you don't realize
[1:05:53] it until you wipe your finger across
[1:05:55] and you're like oh man that's dirty
[1:05:57] that's dusty
[1:05:59] and let me say sin in this 2020
[1:06:02] age is like dust that settles down
[1:06:06] upon our hearts you say
[1:06:09] what we need a we need a searching
[1:06:12] more than ever before revelations
[1:06:15] chapter 2 it
[1:06:16] talks about the depth of satan that
[1:06:19] there's
[1:06:19] there's a there's a there's a depth to
[1:06:22] sin
[1:06:23] that's a profound darkness an abyss
[1:06:27] it speaks about darkness shall come upon
[1:06:29] the people in gross darkness
[1:06:31] darkness shall come upon the land and
[1:06:32] gross darkness that gross darkness is
[1:06:34] not gross like yuck or disgusting
[1:06:37] but it's a measurement it's a weight and
[1:06:40] so he says the darkness is going to be
[1:06:42] so
[1:06:42] gross it's a it's a it's a it's a heavy
[1:06:46] weight in the world and he's saying
[1:06:49] evil the evil that exists in this day
[1:06:52] penetrates further than your than your
[1:06:55] five senses
[1:06:58] i hope you hear me uh both old and young
[1:07:00] but particularly the young people today
[1:07:03] sin is so subtle in this age that we
[1:07:06] live in
[1:07:07] and it has a much greater desire than
[1:07:09] just transforming the
[1:07:11] the outward look or appearance that you
[1:07:14] have
[1:07:15] you know music the wrong kind of music
[1:07:17] will do that to a person it'll change
[1:07:19] their entire appearance
[1:07:20] it'll change how they dress and they
[1:07:22] don't realize their influence is be
[1:07:24] the influence is the reason why they're
[1:07:26] attracted to certain clothing is because
[1:07:28] of
[1:07:28] certain outward uh influences
[1:07:31] but let me say that the desire of sin
[1:07:34] is not just to change you outwardly but
[1:07:37] to
[1:07:38] totally change you inwardly
[1:07:42] and the effect of sin is to deform you
[1:07:45] emotionally
[1:07:46] to to deform you mentally to where he
[1:07:49] changes
[1:07:50] how you look at the world he changes how
[1:07:52] you look at life
[1:07:53] he changes how you look at your parents
[1:07:55] how you look at the bible how you look
[1:07:57] at faith how you look at church
[1:08:01] and sin wants to completely deform you
[1:08:04] inwardly it wants to do just how the
[1:08:06] holy spirit
[1:08:08] wants to do an inward work sin wants to
[1:08:10] do an inward work also
[1:08:15] so he says it goes down the this is
[1:08:19] this is this is david speaking he says
[1:08:21] the inward thought of every one of them
[1:08:23] and heart is is deep
[1:08:25] so it's a it's a warning and david's
[1:08:28] saying search me o god
[1:08:30] and before more than ever before sin is
[1:08:32] more
[1:08:34] accessible than it's ever been
[1:08:38] it's it's easier to access than it's
[1:08:40] ever been before
[1:08:42] and so he in the this is this is exactly
[1:08:45] what has prophesied in this last day
[1:08:47] that because of a bounded iniquity
[1:08:49] the hearts of many would wax cold
[1:08:51] because of the deceitfulness
[1:08:53] of sin and so
[1:08:57] there's a there's a it takes roots
[1:09:00] it goes into the channels brother adam
[1:09:02] preaches on this and he says you've got
[1:09:04] to clear out the channels
[1:09:05] because the flu can get clogged up with
[1:09:08] the wrong thing
[1:09:09] and then we wonder why am i why am i
[1:09:11] struggling
[1:09:12] to with this or with that or why am i
[1:09:15] why am i struggling to believe the
[1:09:16] promise over here
[1:09:17] many times it's oftentimes it's because
[1:09:19] our channels are so clogged up we don't
[1:09:21] even realize it
[1:09:23] and so david says search me
[1:09:26] oh god see if there be any wicked way in
[1:09:31] me
[1:09:32] so this is a this is the desire of a
[1:09:34] heart that wants to walk perfect before
[1:09:36] the lord
[1:09:37] the heart says i want to be searched
[1:09:39] lord
[1:09:41] i want you to search the innermost part
[1:09:43] of my being
[1:09:44] go beyond my dress code
[1:09:48] go beyond my religiosity go beyond my so
[1:09:51] my
[1:09:51] my my uh affiliations with with
[1:09:54] believers
[1:09:55] go beyond my chur what church i go to go
[1:09:58] beyond who my family comes from
[1:09:59] lord go beyond all of the facade that i
[1:10:02] can create
[1:10:03] search the inward part lord search the
[1:10:07] hidden
[1:10:07] part shine your light into the darkest
[1:10:11] parts
[1:10:12] and investigate dig out
[1:10:16] can you say amen this morning this is
[1:10:19] what the believer wants dig it out lord
[1:10:20] expose it
[1:10:23] expose it a shallow christian just
[1:10:25] coming to church won't do that
[1:10:28] because sometimes people wear the
[1:10:30] thickest body armor they
[1:10:32] have at church
[1:10:35] sometimes people wear the thickest body
[1:10:37] armor emotionally and
[1:10:38] that nothing's gonna nothing's gonna uh
[1:10:41] uh uh penetrate them
[1:10:42] but the the perfect heart says lord i
[1:10:46] i'm going to let go of all of my body
[1:10:48] armor i'm going to let go of all of my
[1:10:50] layers
[1:10:51] i'm going to let go of all of pretense
[1:10:56] and so he says this is what it means to
[1:10:59] have a perfect heart
[1:11:01] jesus says in revelations 2 verse 23 he
[1:11:03] says
[1:11:04] uh all the churches shall know that i am
[1:11:06] he
[1:11:08] which searcheth the reigns and hearts
[1:11:12] and i will give unto every one of you
[1:11:13] according to your work so this is what
[1:11:15] the lord says
[1:11:16] i i'm searching but here's why now
[1:11:19] here's here's something so important to
[1:11:20] understand about the lord
[1:11:22] the cops investigate and they search to
[1:11:25] bust somebody
[1:11:28] they they they launch a covert operation
[1:11:30] and they begin to spy
[1:11:31] and surveil people for the purpose of
[1:11:34] not helping them
[1:11:36] but to take them down but let me just
[1:11:38] say something very simple god doesn't
[1:11:40] search you
[1:11:41] and expose you to bring you down or
[1:11:44] destroy you
[1:11:45] but god searches the heart to redeem you
[1:11:49] what a very difference the the the the
[1:11:52] you know that we have here the holy
[1:11:53] spirit
[1:11:54] isn't there to bust you or to expose you
[1:11:56] or to embarrass you or to shame you
[1:11:58] but god says i'm searching i'm exposing
[1:12:00] i'm pulling out the under layers because
[1:12:02] i want to redeem you
[1:12:05] i want to save you i want to clean you i
[1:12:08] want to wash you
[1:12:10] i want you to have a pure heart
[1:12:14] i want a heart that can trust and i
[1:12:17] almost titled this message
[1:12:19] trusting the shepherd and you're going
[1:12:21] to see why here in just a moment
[1:12:23] but god wants a heart that can trust
[1:12:26] because when a heart is laid out before
[1:12:28] the lord it's a heart that's
[1:12:29] trusting david says in psalms 22
[1:12:33] verse 4 he says our fathers trusted in
[1:12:36] thee they trusted
[1:12:38] this is our david's speaking he says our
[1:12:39] fathers trusted in thee
[1:12:42] they trusted and thou did delivered them
[1:12:46] they cried unto thee and were delivered
[1:12:50] he says that again they trusted in thee
[1:12:54] and were not confounded
[1:12:58] you know how many times in your memory
[1:12:59] you can remember reading psalms
[1:13:01] and and especially the psalms that david
[1:13:03] wrote
[1:13:04] because david didn't write all the
[1:13:06] psalms but you'd notice the ones david
[1:13:07] you
[1:13:08] you you even if it's doesn't even if
[1:13:10] you're scoffing or whatever bible
[1:13:11] doesn't identify
[1:13:12] who the writer is you can identify just
[1:13:14] by some of the things that are being
[1:13:15] said because david
[1:13:16] is repetitive he speaks from something
[1:13:19] you can always identify
[1:13:22] he says in psalms 11 verse 1
[1:13:25] in the lord this is david in the lord
[1:13:28] put on my trust and psalms 25
[1:13:33] verse 2 he says oh my god
[1:13:36] i trust in thee so the trust you say
[1:13:40] well
[1:13:40] the the what does that word mean that
[1:13:42] word trust means
[1:13:43] i'm going to read you the exact
[1:13:45] definition to fling
[1:13:49] to fling oneself off of a precipice
[1:13:54] this is what it means this is what david
[1:13:57] says lord i'll put my trust in you
[1:13:59] i'll trust in the lord and he says
[1:14:03] it means you're you're you're you're
[1:14:05] casting yourself
[1:14:07] you're you're throwing yourself like a
[1:14:09] child would would have so much trust in
[1:14:11] a father and take a little baby
[1:14:13] and they don't know there's no fear
[1:14:15] there there's such trust in the arms of
[1:14:17] their father they'll just fling
[1:14:18] themselves off of a high place unto
[1:14:20] their father because they know he's
[1:14:21] going to catch me
[1:14:22] amen do you realize this is what david
[1:14:25] means when he says i put my trust in you
[1:14:28] david says when my heart is overwhelmed
[1:14:30] lead me to the rock that is higher than
[1:14:32] i
[1:14:32] when my enemies come against me i'll put
[1:14:34] my trust in you what's he saying
[1:14:36] i'll throw myself off into your arms
[1:14:40] lord
[1:14:40] i'm going to trust you so much with this
[1:14:42] matter this problem or this situation
[1:14:45] i'm not going to worry about it i'm
[1:14:46] going to trust in you i'm going to cast
[1:14:48] my cares upon you for
[1:14:50] you careth for me this is like to be a
[1:14:53] child again as
[1:14:54] the father says jump and there's no
[1:14:58] pause there's no question there's no
[1:15:00] wondering they'll just freely do it
[1:15:03] it's only fear of falling that that that
[1:15:06] they lose their confidence but god says
[1:15:10] i want a heart that's perfect
[1:15:11] so it's got to be a heart that can be
[1:15:13] searched it's got to be a heart that can
[1:15:15] trust me
[1:15:16] in all matters of our life and let me
[1:15:18] just say this to you my brother my
[1:15:19] sister
[1:15:20] some of us even here today are in
[1:15:22] situations where we are
[1:15:24] we have one choice we can either trust
[1:15:26] the lord
[1:15:27] or we could give up on god
[1:15:30] because sometimes god puts you in spots
[1:15:32] in your life where you have to make a
[1:15:34] choice
[1:15:35] and you have to make a decision i'm
[1:15:38] talking very
[1:15:38] naturally here you've got to make a
[1:15:40] decision to say lord i'm on the edge
[1:15:42] i'm about to go over i'm going to either
[1:15:45] i'm going to
[1:15:46] jump and i'm either going to trust you
[1:15:48] lord or i'm going to fall to my death
[1:15:52] and god says will you trust me in the
[1:15:54] darkest moment
[1:15:55] will you trust me uh in the most
[1:15:57] impossible situation
[1:16:00] can you trust me then and you know some
[1:16:02] people say well
[1:16:03] you know i'm just trusting the lord and
[1:16:04] i'm just i'm just going to resign to
[1:16:06] whatever happens
[1:16:08] that's not trusting the lord i'm just
[1:16:11] going to resign whatever happens happens
[1:16:12] that's fatalism
[1:16:14] you know quesara whatever will be will
[1:16:16] be
[1:16:17] future is not mine i'm just going to
[1:16:19] just i i
[1:16:21] you know i can't i can't handle it i
[1:16:22] can't do anything else whatever i'm just
[1:16:24] going to let it go just whatever happens
[1:16:25] i trust you lord that's not trusting the
[1:16:27] lord
[1:16:30] that's not trusting your shepherd
[1:16:34] that's numbing yourself to the pain
[1:16:38] to where you become so numb to it you
[1:16:40] just i'm not gonna i'm gonna
[1:16:41] i'm gonna uh i'm gonna disengage i'm
[1:16:44] gonna check out
[1:16:47] and try and tribulation can bring us to
[1:16:49] this edge
[1:16:51] trouble can bring us trial could bring
[1:16:53] us to this edge
[1:16:54] to where we become almost numb to it to
[1:16:58] resign from it to say i
[1:16:59] i just give up i'm just not going to do
[1:17:01] anything else but let me say this to you
[1:17:03] my brother
[1:17:04] trust is is not a passive thing that a
[1:17:06] believer does
[1:17:07] trust is an active faith that you have
[1:17:10] in your heart
[1:17:11] that no matter what happens it's going
[1:17:13] to be for my benefit
[1:17:14] because i have a heavenly father who's
[1:17:16] my shepherd
[1:17:17] and i'm not going to fear i'm going to
[1:17:20] trust him that no matter what happens

[1:18:04] times people limit their trust in the
[1:18:05] lord in that way

[1:20:26] he controls everything that happens in
[1:20:29] my
[1:20:30] life everything
[1:20:34] jesus even the bible speaks of jesus
[1:20:36] being led into the wilderness
[1:20:37] you know and here's the devil here comes
[1:20:38] satan to tempt him the bible says he was
[1:20:40] led by the spirit into the wilderness
[1:20:42] satan didn't lead him there the spirit
[1:20:46] led him there
[1:20:48] are you with me here this morning think
[1:20:50] of job
[1:20:51] brother adam says god can't he says he
[1:20:53] says even
[1:20:54] satan had to get permission from god
[1:20:57] before he could touch a
[1:20:58] hair on the head of job amen
[1:21:01] he couldn't kill him couldn't hurt him
[1:21:03] even the messenger that paul
[1:21:05] uh receives the bible says a messenger
[1:21:08] there was given unto me by god a
[1:21:10] messenger of satan
[1:21:11] so god allowed it in his life
[1:21:15] god allows everything that happens to us
[1:21:19] he signs off
[1:21:23] signs off brother adam speaks about job
[1:21:27] and he says god's god's seen every
[1:21:28] single bit of it
[1:21:29] satan couldn't touch a hair on his on
[1:21:32] his head
[1:21:33] you know who removed the hedge god
[1:21:35] removed the hedge
[1:21:38] not satan god had hedged him remember
[1:21:41] satan says you've put a hedge around him

[1:21:46] revealing something to you here in 2020
[1:21:49] god puts a hedge around you
[1:21:52] and no devil can take that hedge away
[1:21:54] unless god says to take it away and you
[1:21:56] say well then why would god because
[1:21:57] here's here's the difference god knows
[1:21:59] what god knows what he put inside of you
[1:22:02] and he's your heavenly father can you

[1:22:14] every step i take is ordered of the lord
[1:22:17] my moment of life my moment of suffering
[1:22:19] if he permits suffering if it
[1:22:21] permits trial if he permits loss if he
[1:22:23] permits
[1:22:24] sorrow if he permits or whatever it is
[1:22:27] in my life
[1:22:28] god orders my steps
[1:22:33] whether i'm standing whether i'm lying
[1:22:34] whether i'm up whether i'm down
[1:22:37] you need to get this fixed in your mind
[1:22:40] i am the apple of his eye
[1:22:44] you are the apple of his eye
[1:22:47] you know what that means that means
[1:22:48] you're you know what the apple of the
[1:22:50] eye is it's
[1:22:51] the iris you know when god calls
[1:22:54] israel and he says they're the apple of
[1:22:56] my eye he's not speaking of an apple
[1:22:58] that you eat
[1:23:00] some people look at that and go oh i'm
[1:23:02] the apple of his eye
[1:23:03] i don't know what that means but it
[1:23:05] sounds good
[1:23:07] well i'll tell you what it means the
[1:23:09] apple is the iris go look in the in a
[1:23:11] mirror you'll see that apple
[1:23:14] and god says this about you you're the
[1:23:17] apple
[1:23:18] of my eye
[1:23:21] you know what that means watch what
[1:23:24] happens when you touch someone's iris
[1:23:29] you know what happens there's a
[1:23:30] knee-jerk reaction your entire body
[1:23:32] convulsing this is what god is saying
[1:23:35] you must this is what he said about
[1:23:36] israel you mess with israel
[1:23:38] you touch the apple of my eye you mess
[1:23:41] with my family you're touching the apple
[1:23:43] of my eye
[1:23:44] you're going to get a response from the
[1:23:45] angelic host of heaven
[1:23:48] you're not on your own my brother my
[1:23:50] sister we're not fighting these battles
[1:23:51] by ourselves
[1:23:52] this isn't god just casting us out as
[1:23:54] children but god says
[1:23:56] i'm going to be their shepherd i'm going
[1:23:57] to lead them i'm going to guide them all
[1:23:59] i'll lead them beside the still water
[1:24:01] i'll lead them into greed pastures yea
[1:24:03] though i walk through the valley of the
[1:24:04] shadow of death i'll fear no
[1:24:06] evil because why there's a shepherd
[1:24:09] there
[1:24:10] and i trust in that shepherd
[1:24:15] a a perfect heart this is this is
[1:24:18] this is a word that we know so well a
[1:24:21] perfect heart and i'm going to read you
[1:24:22] a scripture in psalms 34. notice this
[1:24:26] psalms 34 verse 18
[1:24:29] the lord is nigh unto them this is means
[1:24:31] close he's closed
[1:24:32] unto them that are of a broken
[1:24:36] heart so we have a perfect heart that
[1:24:39] trusts a perfect heart that can be
[1:24:43] searched and then we have a broken heart
[1:24:48] and god says something about this heart
[1:24:50] the condition
[1:24:51] he says the lord is close
[1:24:54] he's nigh his spirit his comfort
[1:24:58] his presence his person god says i'm
[1:25:02] nigh
[1:25:02] unto them that are of a broken heart
[1:25:07] and saveth such as be of a contrite you
[1:25:10] might wonder what that word
[1:25:12] contrite means it means crushed
[1:25:16] those he says i'm close to those of a
[1:25:17] broken heart
[1:25:19] and save as such as be of a
[1:25:22] crushed spirit contrite
[1:25:26] spirit so brokenness you say brother man
[1:25:28] what is the lord close to brokenness
[1:25:30] that's my weeping
[1:25:31] that's my crime that's not really what
[1:25:33] brokenness is
[1:25:34] that's my weeping that's my crying
[1:25:36] that's the beginning of being broken but
[1:25:38] that's not brokenness
[1:25:40] are you here this morning the lord is
[1:25:43] close to a broken
[1:25:44] heart but let me say broken is more than
[1:25:47] sadness it's more than blues it's more
[1:25:49] than
[1:25:49] sorrow it's more than tears it's more
[1:25:52] than being crushed
[1:25:53] in humility and you're just crushed uh
[1:25:56] and you say brother man is that
[1:25:57] weeping yeah weeping is a person who's
[1:25:59] broken you could say is a
[1:26:01] a person who's weeping is broken-hearted
[1:26:04] and we groan before the lord and many of
[1:26:06] us here today we groan before the lord
[1:26:10] we we cry we sigh the bible
[1:26:13] speaks of that and don't never lose that
[1:26:15] because that's part of
[1:26:16] that's part of of who you are you're a
[1:26:18] child that's why the bible says we cry
[1:26:21] abba father do you murmur no there's a
[1:26:25] big difference between murmuring and
[1:26:26] complaining and crying
[1:26:29] and sighing and we cry and we sigh we
[1:26:33] weep and we groan and we're broken and
[1:26:36] spirit
[1:26:37] we're broken in our in our whatever the
[1:26:40] situation is
[1:26:41] we're broken and then god says god says
[1:26:44] here in psalms 51
[1:26:46] verse 17 he says the sacrifices of god
[1:26:48] very familiar
[1:26:50] he says the sacrifices of god
[1:26:53] you have that psalms 51 verse 17
[1:26:57] the sacrifices of god are a broken
[1:27:00] spirit
[1:27:01] a broken and contrite heart
[1:27:05] o god thou will not despise
[1:27:10] a broken and contrite heart
[1:27:13] psalms 51 thou will not despise
[1:27:18] and you know who god relates this to god
[1:27:22] associates brokenness to a story in the
[1:27:25] bible you know very well and that story
[1:27:27] is the story of
[1:27:28] nehemiah and the broken walls of
[1:27:31] jerusalem
[1:27:32] this is what is being referenced here
[1:27:34] because the walls were torn down the
[1:27:36] walls were broken
[1:27:37] the walls were shattered were tattered
[1:27:39] there was nothing left
[1:27:41] and so he says this is this is this is
[1:27:44] what it means
[1:27:45] brokenness is walls that are broke down
[1:27:48] ruin
[1:27:48] that's laying in our lives ruin and
[1:27:51] and he says the sacrifices have got a
[1:27:53] broken spirit a broken contrite heart
[1:27:55] and he says notice that what the very
[1:27:57] next word uh verses in verse 18
[1:28:00] do good in thy good pleasure unto zion
[1:28:04] build thou the walls of jerusalem amen
[1:28:07] so you see the connection with
[1:28:09] brokenness
[1:28:10] and the walls of jerusalem and he says
[1:28:13] build thou
[1:28:14] the walls that are broken and contract
[1:28:16] he says brother
[1:28:17] a a a a the sacrifice of god or a broken
[1:28:20] spirit broken and conquer heart of god
[1:28:22] that will not despise
[1:28:23] so do good and thy good pleasure unto
[1:28:25] zion
[1:28:26] build thou the walls of jerusalem
[1:28:32] build thou the walls of jerusalem you
[1:28:34] know your mind
[1:28:35] immediately when you read that goes to a
[1:28:37] man who was broken
[1:28:40] a man who the bible says was weeping
[1:28:44] nehemiah was weeping over
[1:28:47] what he's seen after he surveyed
[1:28:49] jerusalem
[1:28:51] and the scripture says nehemiah he says
[1:28:53] in nehemiah chapter 2
[1:28:55] verse 12. he says and i arose it in the
[1:28:58] night and
[1:28:59] i and some few men with me neither told
[1:29:02] i any man what my god had put in my
[1:29:03] heart to do it jerusalem
[1:29:05] neither was there any beast with me save
[1:29:07] the beast i rode upon
[1:29:08] then went eye up in the night by the
[1:29:10] brook and viewed the wall
[1:29:12] and turned back and entered by the gate
[1:29:15] of the valley
[1:29:16] and so returned so nehemiah goes on this
[1:29:19] journey and he views the wall
[1:29:22] what what what was a wall
[1:29:26] if you use the condition of jerusalem we
[1:29:29] don't want to take the time you know the
[1:29:30] you know the history here of the
[1:29:31] babylonian captivity
[1:29:33] and that their their jerusalem is now
[1:29:35] ransacked and is destroyed
[1:29:37] and nehemiah comes back and he gets
[1:29:39] permission and he's viewing the walls
[1:29:41] and he sees this broken down city
[1:29:45] he says in the dark of the night he
[1:29:48] viewed the walls
[1:29:49] this is the word shabar it's the same
[1:29:52] exact word in psalms 51 verse 17 for
[1:29:55] broken heart
[1:29:58] and so nehemiah's heart is broken
[1:30:01] it's a broken heart it's a brokenness a
[1:30:03] heart that's broken before the lord
[1:30:06] and the bible says he sat down and he
[1:30:09] wept
[1:30:10] and he mourned certain days and fasted
[1:30:14] this is verse 4 of nehemiah 1. he sat
[1:30:18] down and wept and mourned certain days
[1:30:22] and fasted and prayed before the god of
[1:30:25] heaven
[1:30:27] let me say there it is brother matt
[1:30:29] there it is
[1:30:30] nehemiah is broken that's a broken heart
[1:30:35] that's brokenness he's weeping he's
[1:30:38] crying
[1:30:40] he's he's in distress but let me just
[1:30:42] let me stop you here and make you
[1:30:43] realize
[1:30:44] this was not a broken heart this was the
[1:30:47] beginning
[1:30:49] of brokenness because brokenness doesn't
[1:30:53] doesn't end with crying it doesn't end
[1:30:56] with weeping
[1:30:57] it starts with weeping it starts with
[1:31:01] crying
[1:31:02] are you here it starts with morning
[1:31:06] it starts and he sees all the ruin he
[1:31:09] says all of the waste
[1:31:11] and he sees all of the destruction and
[1:31:13] let me just say this he could have
[1:31:15] nehemiah could have stayed in shushan
[1:31:17] and the king's palace
[1:31:18] and he and he could have had went back
[1:31:20] home and just weeped and he could have
[1:31:22] cried
[1:31:23] and went next month and oh i just got
[1:31:24] the blues and all i'm i'm just i'm just
[1:31:26] mourning over all the brokenness that
[1:31:28] i've seen and i
[1:31:29] i'm just so what's wrong with me am i oh
[1:31:31] i'm just so sad i'm i'm so torn up over
[1:31:34] what took place i'm so messed up over
[1:31:36] what's happening oh you don't know
[1:31:38] what i'm going through you don't know
[1:31:39] what's happening to me
[1:31:42] what are you doing i'm fasting uh uh you
[1:31:44] know i'm i'm i'm
[1:31:45] i'm i just i can't believe what what
[1:31:48] what's happened
[1:31:48] but let me tell you something friends
[1:31:50] that would have never led to restoration
[1:31:54] if all he could do is sit and cry and
[1:31:56] mourn and be sad over
[1:31:58] but that sadness that weeping that
[1:32:00] mourning was leading him to action
[1:32:03] to say let's rebuild what's been broken
[1:32:07] because true brokenness leads you to
[1:32:09] restoration it leads you to say
[1:32:11] i'm mourning i'm crying i'm broken but
[1:32:13] i'm going to have faith that god can do
[1:32:15] something about it that all the ruin
[1:32:19] that i see i'm going to
[1:32:21] set my heart to do something about it
[1:32:25] the bible says in nehemiah chapter 2
[1:32:27] verse 10 there was come a man to seek
[1:32:29] the welfare of the children of israel
[1:32:31] nehemiah says i told no one what my god
[1:32:34] had put in my heart to do
[1:32:35] at jerusalem so he goes outside and he's
[1:32:38] viewing all of this ruin
[1:32:40] he's viewing all the the hebrew word for
[1:32:42] uh meaning is
[1:32:43] his heart was breaking it was breaking
[1:32:46] it
[1:32:47] it broke first with anguish and sadness
[1:32:50] and sorrow
[1:32:51] and then his heart breaks towards hope
[1:32:55] to rebuild this is this is what it means
[1:32:59] to have a truly
[1:33:00] broken you say i'm signed and crying for
[1:33:02] the morning
[1:33:03] for the sins done in jerusalem done in
[1:33:06] my city
[1:33:07] what is true brokenness a true
[1:33:09] brokenness
[1:33:10] is is is one that sees the ruin
[1:33:13] and the destruction and the and the and
[1:33:16] the
[1:33:16] and the the calamity that satan has
[1:33:19] brought to god's family
[1:33:21] and so we grieve over the reproach
[1:33:24] that's been brought to the lord's
[1:33:26] name but we don't stop there we look
[1:33:28] down and say lord
[1:33:30] i'm going to do something about it i'm
[1:33:32] not just going to sit and be broken over
[1:33:34] i'm going to take action
[1:33:35] i'm going to pick up a hammer and i'm
[1:33:37] going to start rebuilding
[1:33:38] i'm going to pick up a brick i'm not
[1:33:40] just going to stay crying
[1:33:42] i'm broken so i'm going to do something
[1:33:44] about it i'm going to pick up a brick
[1:33:45] i'm going to pick up a hammer i'm going
[1:33:47] to pick up a shovel a pickaxe whatever
[1:33:49] it is
[1:33:50] and i'm going to take action to rebuild
[1:33:52] what's been ruined in my life
[1:33:56] i'm going to take action to repair the
[1:33:58] breach
[1:33:59] whatever area of my life has been broken
[1:34:03] down
[1:34:06] i want to repair it lord
[1:34:09] can you say that here today i want to
[1:34:11] repair it lord
[1:34:13] uh i i want the my brokenness to lead
[1:34:17] yes it
[1:34:18] leads through sadness through sorrow but
[1:34:19] let it spring forth
[1:34:22] into a confidence to say i can the lord
[1:34:25] is my helper and i can rebuild
[1:34:27] whatever's been broken
[1:34:29] the lord is my the lord is my shepherd
[1:34:31] the lord is my reward the lord is my
[1:34:33] victory
[1:34:34] the lord is my father and i can rebuild
[1:34:37] whatever satan has broken
[1:34:38] here with help with strength from the
[1:34:40] lord i can do all things through christ
[1:34:43] who gives me strength
[1:34:47] the lord is my shepherd i shall not want
[1:34:49] david says in psalms 23
[1:34:52] he says the lord is my shepherd now
[1:34:53] notice this psalm here if you want to
[1:34:55] put it on the screen
[1:34:56] this is a psalm that david writes not
[1:34:59] not as a
[1:35:00] not as a shepherd he doesn't write this
[1:35:01] as a shepherd this is david is a king
[1:35:05] and so david's looking back in his life
[1:35:08] you know
[1:35:08] god is going god you very carefully
[1:35:11] you'll notice in the bible god very
[1:35:12] carefully
[1:35:13] he doesn't use every vocation of man he
[1:35:16] doesn't use every trade
[1:35:17] he doesn't speak of he doesn't attribute
[1:35:19] himself
[1:35:20] to everything in the earth but there's
[1:35:22] certain things that god
[1:35:24] uses uh and and and he uses
[1:35:28] to relate his relationship creator to
[1:35:30] creation
[1:35:31] you remember he uses a potter and he
[1:35:33] says and he uses a potter as an example
[1:35:35] and ken of ken that paul says can the
[1:35:37] thing form say the thing that forms it
[1:35:38] god uses a carpenter what's he doing
[1:35:40] he's using it's
[1:35:42] it's he he says this in he says the hand
[1:35:44] of the lord was upon elijah that doesn't
[1:35:46] literally mean that god's hand was upon
[1:35:48] elijah
[1:35:49] but it was speaking of something it was
[1:35:51] meaning something that
[1:35:53] his his spirit his presence was heavy
[1:35:56] upon elijah
[1:35:56] and so the lord is using this example
[1:35:59] and david says
[1:36:00] the lord is my shepherd
[1:36:03] he's going to use a a shepherd and he
[1:36:07] and
[1:36:07] he begins to recall no doubt david's
[1:36:09] recalling in his mind
[1:36:11] his days as a shepherd over sheep
[1:36:15] i love this so much this what this i'm
[1:36:18] going to read you i wish i had it to put
[1:36:19] on the screen
[1:36:20] that don't but i'm going to read it here
[1:36:22] from charles spurgeon
[1:36:23] about psalms 23 because psalms 23 so
[1:36:27] many times has been used for funerals
[1:36:30] it's been sometimes as the last dying
[1:36:32] breath the last things that someone says
[1:36:34] before they die
[1:36:35] i don't think david had any idea when he
[1:36:37] wrote psalms 23 how profound it would
[1:36:39] become
[1:36:40] in time in history the lord is my
[1:36:43] shepherd i shall not want psalms 23
[1:36:46] verse 1
[1:36:46] the lord is my shepherd i shall not want
[1:36:50] i shall not need spurgeon says
[1:36:54] this psalm has charmed more griefs to
[1:36:57] rest
[1:36:58] than all the philosophy of the world
[1:37:01] it is remanded to their dungeon more
[1:37:04] felon thoughts more
[1:37:06] black doubts more thieving sorrows than
[1:37:09] there are
[1:37:09] sands on the seashore it is comforted
[1:37:13] the noble host of the poor
[1:37:14] it has sung courage to the army of the
[1:37:17] disappointed
[1:37:18] it is poor bomb and consolation into the
[1:37:21] heart of the sick
[1:37:22] of captives in dungeons of widows
[1:37:25] and their pinching griefs of orphans in
[1:37:28] their loneliness
[1:37:29] dying soldiers have died easier as it
[1:37:31] was read to them
[1:37:32] ghastly hospitals have been illuminated
[1:37:35] it has visited the prisoner
[1:37:37] and broken his chains and like peter's
[1:37:40] angel
[1:37:40] led him forth in imagination and sung
[1:37:43] him back to his home again
[1:37:46] it has made the dying christian slave
[1:37:49] freer
[1:37:50] than his master and consoled those whom
[1:37:54] dying he left behind mourning not so
[1:37:57] much that he was gone is because they
[1:37:59] were left behind
[1:38:00] and could not go to
[1:38:04] so millions of people have memorized
[1:38:06] this psalm
[1:38:07] even some people who don't even know the
[1:38:09] bible at all never been in church can
[1:38:11] quote psalms 23.
[1:38:14] of your very ministers have used it to
[1:38:16] confront people
[1:38:17] you're going through severe trial or
[1:38:19] even death or suffering or illness
[1:38:22] and so david writes this without any
[1:38:25] idea the
[1:38:26] the impact it would have upon the world
[1:38:29] the lord is my shepherd
[1:38:32] i shall not want
[1:38:36] this is this is all throughout the bible
[1:38:38] he's called this
[1:38:39] shepherd in genesis chapter 49 verse
[1:38:43] the bible says i'm just going to read it
[1:38:45] to you here if you get it good if not
[1:38:47] it's fine
[1:38:48] it says the lord is the shepherd the
[1:38:50] stone
[1:38:51] the lord is my the lord is the shepherd
[1:38:53] the stone of israel
[1:38:55] so long before david attributes him as
[1:38:57] this
[1:38:58] shepherd genesis you find it all the way
[1:39:01] at the beginning of the bible in psalms
[1:39:03] david says in psalms 28 verse 9 he
[1:39:07] speaks of
[1:39:08] of the lord as his shepherd i want you
[1:39:10] to turn to john chapter 10
[1:39:12] just very quickly if you could we're
[1:39:13] going to close here i'm not going to be
[1:39:14] much longer
[1:39:15] i know it's already 12 45 here so give
[1:39:18] me about 10 more minutes
[1:39:19] john chapter 10 verily verily i say unto
[1:39:23] you
[1:39:23] he that entereth not by the door and to
[1:39:26] the sheepfold
[1:39:27] verily i said he that entereth not by
[1:39:29] the door into the sheepfold but climath
[1:39:31] up some other way
[1:39:32] the same is a thief and a robber
[1:39:36] but he that entereth in by the door
[1:39:41] is the shepherd of the sheep
[1:39:44] and so here's jesus now related himself
[1:39:47] beyond david
[1:39:48] who would say he's my shepherd i could
[1:39:50] have read you 30 more scriptures of god
[1:39:52] being referenced as shepherd
[1:39:54] but now we come to jesus himself and he
[1:39:56] says he that entereth through the window
[1:39:58] or some other way
[1:40:00] that's the thief that's the robber who's
[1:40:02] he identifying the enemy
[1:40:04] he's identifying the devil but with the
[1:40:07] devil there's also
[1:40:08] a god with a thief and a robber there's
[1:40:10] also a shepherd
[1:40:12] with the thief who comes to steal kill
[1:40:14] and destroy there also came a protector
[1:40:17] a shepherd who would watch over his
[1:40:19] family
[1:40:21] notice jesus says that the one who
[1:40:23] entereth by the door
[1:40:25] is the shepherd of the sheep
[1:40:28] to him the porter openeth and the sheep
[1:40:31] hear his voice
[1:40:32] and he calleth his own sheep by name
[1:40:35] and leadeth them out so jesus now
[1:40:39] relates even himself this is amazing
[1:40:42] here
[1:40:42] david knows this the lord is my shepherd
[1:40:46] and so so let me let me just read you
[1:40:48] some notes here from spurgeon
[1:40:51] he says a sheep is an object of property
[1:40:55] not a wild animal its owner sets
[1:40:59] great store by it and frequently it is
[1:41:01] bought with a great price
[1:41:03] it is well to know as certainly as david
[1:41:05] did
[1:41:06] that we belonged to the lord
[1:41:09] amen you'll never understand the lord is
[1:41:12] your shepherd until you understand i
[1:41:14] am his sheep until we realize that we've
[1:41:19] been purchased we've been bought
[1:41:20] and we're sheep we all like sheep have
[1:41:23] gone astray
[1:41:25] so god says he that jesus says he that
[1:41:28] entereth by the door
[1:41:29] is the shepherd the thief comes the
[1:41:31] robber comes he climbs up some other way
[1:41:33] but heated under by the door is the
[1:41:34] shepherd of the sheep verse 4
[1:41:36] and when he put forth his own sheep he
[1:41:38] goeth before them and the sheep follow
[1:41:40] him
[1:41:40] for they know his voice and a stranger
[1:41:43] they will not follow but will flee from
[1:41:44] him for they know
[1:41:46] not the voice of the stranger
[1:41:49] and so jesus says there's a there's a a
[1:41:52] a
[1:41:52] the thief cometh uh verse 10.
[1:41:56] let me back up here verse verse 8.
[1:42:00] verse 7 back up one more he says then
[1:42:03] said jesus unto them verily verily i say
[1:42:05] unto you
[1:42:06] i am the door of the sheep you know
[1:42:08] brother branham says he struggled over
[1:42:10] this and didn't understand what did that
[1:42:11] mean
[1:42:12] i am the door i am the door
[1:42:15] of the sheep and the prophet says i
[1:42:18] always struggled
[1:42:19] trying to understand you know david
[1:42:22] refers to
[1:42:23] refers to god as king many more times
[1:42:25] than he does shepherd
[1:42:27] it refers to god as king he refers to
[1:42:30] god as
[1:42:31] ruler he refers to god as lord
[1:42:34] and brother adam says i didn't
[1:42:35] understand this what does it mean
[1:42:37] shepherd
[1:42:38] what does it mean he's the door and he
[1:42:39] says i always struggle with that till i
[1:42:41] went over
[1:42:42] in the east and he says and i seen how
[1:42:44] that the shepherds over there
[1:42:46] he says when they would when they would
[1:42:47] take all of the sheep into the pen
[1:42:50] and he says the shepherd would then lay
[1:42:52] down where the two
[1:42:54] walls of the pen met there was no door
[1:42:57] he said the shepherd literally would lay
[1:42:59] his body down there
[1:43:02] and he was the door
[1:43:05] and brother branham says then i
[1:43:07] understood when jesus when he says i am
[1:43:09] the door of the sheep
[1:43:11] what's he saying you're not going to get
[1:43:14] to my sheep
[1:43:16] unless you come through me first
[1:43:19] you ought to rejoice in that my brother
[1:43:21] my sister you're not going to get to my
[1:43:23] children unless you come through
[1:43:25] me first i'm not going to send a prophet
[1:43:27] i'm not going to send an angel
[1:43:28] i'm not going to send a bible verse i'm
[1:43:30] coming myself to protect my children
[1:43:34] and not the devil can't get to your
[1:43:36] children your sons your
[1:43:38] daughters your family your mind unless
[1:43:40] he first comes through the lord
[1:43:42] because i am the good shepherd
[1:43:45] and he says and i lay my life down
[1:43:46] notice what he says here in verse 8
[1:43:48] and he says all verse 8 all that ever
[1:43:51] came before me are thieves and robbers
[1:43:54] but the sheep did not hear them
[1:43:56] verse 9 i am the door by me if any man
[1:44:00] enter in he shall be saved and shall go
[1:44:02] in
[1:44:03] and out and find pasture
[1:44:07] he's referencing here's david and david
[1:44:10] says the lord is my shepherd
[1:44:12] i shall not want to turn that psalm 23
[1:44:15] says i shall not want
[1:44:16] that means that means all my needs are
[1:44:20] supplied
[1:44:22] by the shepherd a sheep
[1:44:25] all of their needs are supplied by the
[1:44:27] shepherd
[1:44:29] he'll he makes me to lie dale notice
[1:44:32] this the lord is my shepherd i shall not
[1:44:33] want he maketh me
[1:44:35] he maketh me to lie down you know we
[1:44:38] don't sometimes know when to lie down
[1:44:41] so god says i'm going to make you lie
[1:44:43] down sometimes god does that very
[1:44:46] physically
[1:44:48] and sometimes he has to cut us down
[1:44:51] to make us lie down because sometimes we
[1:44:54] can get so go go go go go go and god
[1:44:57] says hold on a minute
[1:44:58] little sheep
[1:45:02] hold on before you get going and you
[1:45:04] think you're in control of your life
[1:45:06] i'm the shepherd and it grabs that sheep
[1:45:09] by
[1:45:09] front and back legs and puts them down
[1:45:14] this is what david says the relationship
[1:45:16] he had with the lord he says the lord he
[1:45:17] maketh me
[1:45:18] to lie down so david god says david
[1:45:22] david says god knows exactly when i need
[1:45:25] rest
[1:45:26] he knows exactly what i need to lay down
[1:45:30] and he says here to lie down notice
[1:45:33] he maketh me to lie down in green
[1:45:35] pastures
[1:45:36] he leadeth me beside the
[1:45:39] still waters
[1:45:43] he leadeth me into green pastures
[1:45:49] i didn't lead me into green pastures
[1:45:53] he leadeth me beside the still waters
[1:45:54] you know you don't know how to lead
[1:45:56] yourself
[1:45:57] to still waters and any time we try to
[1:46:00] lead ourselves to green pastures and
[1:46:02] still waters we go to
[1:46:03] we go to the wrong thing we end up in
[1:46:06] the bushes we end up in the thorns in
[1:46:08] the briar patch
[1:46:09] of hollywood so we say i need rest so
[1:46:13] i'm going to go and find green pastures
[1:46:14] and we look to money
[1:46:16] we look to success we look to disney
[1:46:18] world hello somebody
[1:46:21] and we we try to get rest we try to get
[1:46:24] vacation we try to get
[1:46:25] uh we try to lead ourselves but god
[1:46:27] david says
[1:46:28] but the lord leads me to green pastures
[1:46:31] he leads me beside
[1:46:33] still waters because a sheep has to have
[1:46:36] still waters
[1:46:38] it's it's nose and mouth are so close
[1:46:40] together that if it was to have rushing
[1:46:41] water it could drown itself
[1:46:44] so god says i'm going to lead it a
[1:46:46] shepherd leads it beside the still
[1:46:48] waters uh he says he restores
[1:46:54] my soul leads me in the paths of
[1:46:56] righteousness for his name's sake
[1:46:58] so this is the tender care this is the
[1:47:00] loving care of the shepherd
[1:47:02] he says he restores my soul
[1:47:05] this is this is uh david's soul is being
[1:47:07] restored how
[1:47:09] by leading me to green pastures by
[1:47:11] leading me besides still waters
[1:47:14] by leading me to start up food by
[1:47:16] leading me to mata
[1:47:17] to pastures green pastures that have
[1:47:19] life in them
[1:47:21] by feeding me the right things and not
[1:47:23] the wrong things
[1:47:25] because when you feed on what god gives
[1:47:28] you it restores your soul
[1:47:31] when you feed on the word its purpose is
[1:47:35] to restore your soul
[1:47:38] it says you restore my soul
[1:47:42] it could also mean that hebrew word
[1:47:44] means reas
[1:47:45] can mean bring me to repentance
[1:47:48] that's what it could also mean he
[1:47:50] restoreth my purity
[1:47:52] he restoreth my my david says that in
[1:47:55] psalms 51
[1:47:56] created me a clean heart uh and and cast
[1:47:58] me not away from that presence restore
[1:47:59] unto me the joy of my salvation
[1:48:02] so he says he restores my
[1:48:06] soul he cleans me he washes me
[1:48:10] because i need wash there's a sheep i
[1:48:12] need washed
[1:48:14] as a sheep i become dirty
[1:48:17] as a sheep i can become stinky
[1:48:21] the world can get its stench on me so he
[1:48:24] cleans me
[1:48:26] he washes me he restores my
[1:48:30] thank soul he leads me i love that
[1:48:35] for the the the he restores my soul he
[1:48:38] leadeth me what a
[1:48:42] what a what a picture of what brother
[1:48:45] adam says he says
[1:48:46] the bible says it's not of the man to
[1:48:48] lead himself and brother brandon
[1:48:49] preaches the message called a guide
[1:48:50] and he says you don't know how to lead
[1:48:52] yourself you've got to have a god
[1:48:54] you've got to have a leader and david
[1:48:56] says he leads me
[1:48:57] he's a shepherd who guides me i don't
[1:49:00] know how to get to green pastures in my
[1:49:02] life i don't know how to find the still
[1:49:04] waters
[1:49:06] but here's what i know here's all i need
[1:49:08] all i need is is a shepherd
[1:49:10] because a shepherd will lead me to the
[1:49:12] right water a shepherd will lead me to
[1:49:14] the right place
[1:49:15] a shepherd will lead me to a secret
[1:49:17] place a shepherd will lead me to good
[1:49:19] food to good things
[1:49:21] i only lead myself to chaos i only need
[1:49:24] myself to wreck
[1:49:25] i only lead myself to the briar patch
[1:49:27] but he leadeth me
[1:49:29] in the paths of righteousness for his
[1:49:31] namesake
[1:49:37] for his name's sake clark says to
[1:49:40] display the glory of his grace
[1:49:42] this is why god leads you to display the
[1:49:45] glory of his grace and not on account of
[1:49:47] any merit in me
[1:49:49] god's motive of conduct towards the
[1:49:51] children of men are derived from the
[1:49:53] perfections
[1:49:54] and goodness of his own nature
[1:49:58] david says yeah though i walk through
[1:50:00] the valley of the shadow of death
[1:50:02] verse 4 yea though i walk through the
[1:50:05] shadow
[1:50:05] through the valley of the shadow of
[1:50:07] death so what's david saying here
[1:50:11] it's a it's a now that the picture has
[1:50:13] changed from green pastures and still
[1:50:14] waters
[1:50:16] now there's the shadow of death and he
[1:50:18] says
[1:50:20] though he lead me through that valley
[1:50:21] though i walk through the valley of the
[1:50:22] shadow of death i will fear
[1:50:24] no evil for thou art with me thy rod and
[1:50:27] thy staff they do comfort me let's keep
[1:50:30] going here verse 5
[1:50:31] thou preparest the table before me
[1:50:34] in the presence of mine enemies
[1:50:38] thou anointest my head with oil
[1:50:42] my cup runneth over
[1:50:45] notice what god is saying here thou
[1:50:47] david says thou
[1:50:48] preparest the table before me
[1:50:52] in the presence of my enemies
[1:50:55] you're going to set a table you're going
[1:50:58] to
[1:50:59] prepare a banquet you're going to put an
[1:51:02] apron there you're going to put out
[1:51:03] plates you're going to put out forks

[1:51:06] you're going to put out food and you're
[1:51:08] going to feed me
[1:51:10] this is what david's saying amen thou
[1:51:12] preparest
[1:51:14] a table before me a spread
[1:51:17] and then what's god going to do david
[1:51:19] says then god puts on a
[1:51:21] waiter's apron and you serve me in the
[1:51:24] presence of my enemies
[1:51:26] that would notice my head with oil my
[1:51:28] cup ran it over do you know this is what
[1:51:29] david is saying
[1:51:31] in verse 5 that in the midst of the
[1:51:33] valley of the shadow of death in the
[1:51:34] midst of all of my enemies who are those
[1:51:37] enemies demonic forces
[1:51:40] he says thou preparest a table you know
[1:51:43] that if you click on that word if you
[1:51:44] have the table uh software and you click
[1:51:46] on that word table
[1:51:47] you're going to get this word spread
[1:51:50] spread you know what we know what that
[1:51:52] means
[1:51:54] spread now talk about spread and butter
[1:51:59] and this is what god david said thou
[1:52:01] preparest a
[1:52:02] spread i want you to catch this because
[1:52:05] today it's something important for you
[1:52:06] as a believer
[1:52:08] he's not just speaking of just a little
[1:52:09] portion
[1:52:11] he's not speaking i'm going to feed you
[1:52:12] some rations like a soldier
[1:52:14] who's shaking and and in fear from the
[1:52:16] enemy and so
[1:52:17] he takes just a little food with eyes
[1:52:19] wide open he's watching
[1:52:20] but david says no in the middle of all
[1:52:22] of my calamity
[1:52:23] in the middle of when the devil's
[1:52:25] attacking my family attacking
[1:52:27] uh everything around me you're gonna sit
[1:52:29] me down at a table
[1:52:30] you're going to put a spread out before
[1:52:32] me
[1:52:34] and you're going to whisper in my ear
[1:52:35] they can't touch you don't worry about
[1:52:37] anything
[1:52:38] they can't touch a hair on your head
[1:52:40] unless i let them touch you
[1:52:42] they can't bother you they can't destroy
[1:52:44] you they can't kill you here
[1:52:46] drink just a little drink right here in
[1:52:47] the presence of my enemies

[1:52:54] before me in the presence of
[1:52:56] my enemies you set down a feast
[1:52:59] before me oh what a thought here
[1:53:04] and then god says i'm going to make your
[1:53:05] enemies stay on the outer fringe
[1:53:08] i'm going to keep them away i'm going to
[1:53:11] shield you
[1:53:12] and i'm also going to make them watch
[1:53:17] notice david doesn't say you you prepare
[1:53:21] a table and then you rebuke the enemy
[1:53:23] and you get them out of there no david
[1:53:25] says in the presence of my
[1:53:27] enemies in the same room in the same
[1:53:30] place in the same house in the same body
[1:53:35] thou preparest the table before me
[1:53:38] he says you're you're you're you're you

[1:54:19] giving me the right food he's given me
[1:54:21] the right drink
[1:54:22] it's giving me exactly what i need
[1:54:26] luke chapter 12 verse 37 jesus speaks of
[1:54:28] the same exact thing
[1:54:29] in luke believe it or not in luke all
[1:54:32] the way in the new testament
[1:54:33] verse chapter 12 verse 37 luke 12
[1:54:37] 37 he says blessed are those servants
[1:54:40] whom the lord when he cometh shall find
[1:54:44] watching i want to be watching verily i
[1:54:47] say unto you
[1:54:49] that he shall gird himself
[1:54:52] and make them to sit down to meet which
[1:54:55] means to eat
[1:54:56] and will come forth and serve them
[1:54:59] amen what's god saying that with those
[1:55:01] that are watching for my appearing
[1:55:03] those that are watching for my coming
[1:55:05] verily verily i say unto you
[1:55:07] i shall serve them in the presence of
[1:55:10] their enemies
[1:55:12] in the middle of trouble in the middle
[1:55:15] of all
[1:55:15] who are your enemies who is your enemy
[1:55:18] the devil
[1:55:20] is not your brother it's not your sister
[1:55:22] now god may anoint people
[1:55:24] the satan may anoint someone to bother
[1:55:26] you but your enemy who david is speaking
[1:55:28] of
[1:55:29] is a demonic force
[1:55:32] he says he says he says thou in the
[1:55:34] presence of my
[1:55:36] enemies
[1:55:39] psalms 18 david speaks of this enemy and
[1:55:42] he's talking about demon spirits
[1:55:44] he says he delivered me from my strong
[1:55:45] enemy and from them which hated me for
[1:55:48] they were too strong
[1:55:49] for me he says in psalms 143 verse 9
[1:55:53] deliver me o lord from my
[1:55:55] enemies i flee unto thee
[1:55:58] to hide me i'm going to close here
[1:56:02] you've got an enemy and you need to
[1:56:05] realize that
[1:56:07] you've got you've got an enemy and it's
[1:56:10] not any person
[1:56:12] necessarily you've got an
[1:56:15] enemy my brother my sister you've you
[1:56:18] ever felt
[1:56:18] you ever had someone or maybe maybe you
[1:56:20] can't relate to this at all
[1:56:22] but have you ever through your entire
[1:56:23] life have you ever had anybody who
[1:56:25] didn't like you
[1:56:30] and maybe you didn't mind them
[1:56:34] but they didn't like you that bothers
[1:56:36] you why don't they like me
[1:56:38] and so what do you do you do everything
[1:56:39] you can to make them like you but they
[1:56:42] don't like you
[1:56:43] and and and you ever had someone who let
[1:56:46] me let me go further you have had
[1:56:47] someone who despises you
[1:56:49] you ever have someone who hates you
[1:56:52] think about it right now
[1:56:53] someone they can't stand me that doesn't
[1:56:56] make me
[1:56:57] i don't know about you but i don't like
[1:56:58] that i'd rather not have any enemies
[1:57:03] i'd rather not have anybody that hates
[1:57:05] me and i'd rather believe
[1:57:07] no one hates me
[1:57:11] you know why because that's natural but
[1:57:13] let me snap you out of that here this
[1:57:14] morning and i need you i need
[1:57:16] this truth to sink down on your mind
[1:57:18] there's somebody who
[1:57:19] hates you
[1:57:23] and he's the enemy of your soul
[1:57:26] and he wants to not just hurt you or
[1:57:29] harm you or
[1:57:30] bully you he wants to kill you
[1:57:34] he wants to take your life and you are
[1:57:37] his
[1:57:37] prime target you are his adversary
[1:57:41] he is your adversary he is your accuser
[1:57:44] and he will attack you mentally he will
[1:57:47] attack you
[1:57:48] physically he will attack you
[1:57:50] spiritually he will attack you
[1:57:52] emotionally this is your enemy he hates
[1:57:55] you he wants to destroy you
[1:57:57] amen he wants to take your life
[1:58:00] he hates everything about you he hates
[1:58:02] your anything that you have good he
[1:58:05] hates it and he wants
[1:58:06] it and he wants to take it
[1:58:09] oh david this is what this is what david
[1:58:11] is meaning here
[1:58:12] he's saying in this the in this
[1:58:14] supernatural feast
[1:58:16] the god in the presence of my
[1:58:19] enemies the lord is going to serve me
[1:58:24] on one side here's the devil here's all
[1:58:26] of his hordes here's all of his demons
[1:58:28] here's all of his enemies here and and
[1:58:31] and this is this is exactly why jesus
[1:58:34] says
[1:58:34] and he types himself to shepherd and he
[1:58:36] says behold he'll leave the ninety and
[1:58:38] nine and go after the one
[1:58:42] but did you ever catch something he
[1:58:43] never had to go after the 90-9
[1:58:46] he only had to go after one because only
[1:58:50] one strayed
[1:58:50] and at the other 99 they were safe
[1:58:54] from the enemy because they were with
[1:58:56] the shepherd
[1:58:57] it was when the sheep decided to leave
[1:58:59] the fold and become
[1:59:00] isolated that now god has to go on a
[1:59:04] rescue mission and go and rescue them
[1:59:06] you know what your enemy wants to do i'm
[1:59:07] closing i don't have time to finish
[1:59:09] let me just stop here and say the devil
[1:59:12] wants more than
[1:59:13] anything to isolate you
[1:59:17] and he will use anything he can to
[1:59:20] isolate
[1:59:22] a sheep to get that
[1:59:25] one separated from the 90-9
[1:59:28] because he knows if he can single you
[1:59:30] out you ever watch
[1:59:32] predators go after their prey they'll
[1:59:34] always go to the pack and they'll try to
[1:59:36] get that one who maybe lags behind as is
[1:59:38] singled out
[1:59:39] and then they'll go all their attention
[1:59:40] will go after him because their safety
[1:59:43] in the pack
[1:59:44] there's safety with the shepherd
[1:59:49] but when we stray away and satan
[1:59:51] isolates us and satan gets us over to an
[1:59:53] island all by
[1:59:54] by ourself
[1:59:57] isn't it amazing you know we're we're
[1:59:59] dealing with a virus here today that
[2:00:01] isolates people it's
[2:00:04] isolated churches it's isolated families
[2:00:07] it's isolated
[2:00:08] people from the from the house of god
[2:00:11] you think this
[2:00:12] isn't the do you think this is just the
[2:00:13] devil attacking the world
[2:00:15] this is the devil attacking the family
[2:00:17] of god to isolate you
[2:00:19] to pull you away i don't know let me
[2:00:22] just say this don't
[2:00:23] isolate yourself don't pull away from
[2:00:26] the pack
[2:00:27] don't get off over by yourself stay
[2:00:30] together
[2:00:31] stay together in unity in harmony stay
[2:00:34] with the shepherd
[2:00:37] stay with the shepherd now more than
[2:00:39] ever before don't get off by yourself
[2:00:43] why do you think the bible speaks of the
[2:00:45] last days and says assemble yourselves
[2:00:47] more as you see the day approaching
[2:00:53] come together more
[2:00:57] have confidence in your shepherd he
[2:01:00] leads me beside the still waters
[2:01:02] yea though i walk through the valley of
[2:01:03] the shadow death i will fear no evil
[2:01:05] for thy rod and thy staff come from
[2:01:07] become musicians if you could stand to
[2:01:09] your feet with me
[2:01:10] clock has expired so we're going to
[2:01:14] close
[2:01:17] buy your heads with me play something if
[2:01:19] you could brother andrew just something
[2:01:21] lord i've poured my heart out with what
[2:01:23] you placed upon it
[2:01:27] means so much to me lord the lord is my
[2:01:31] shepherd
[2:01:32] my watcher he takes care of me he feeds
