Pride and His Prisoners - Jason DeMars
TRANSCRIPT
========================================
good morning everyone god bless you let's stand and pray and read our opening scripture heavenly father we come before you now lord and we're so thankful for your grace and mercy lord we know that as the scripture speaks to us that we should rejoice more and and glory more in our infirmities lord because when we're weak then you are strong and lord help us to always recognize our our own weakness and frailty and our desperate need for you lord so i ask that you'd come and that you would minister through your word to your people we ask in jesus name amen so i'm gonna start a a topic probably take two times maybe three um on pride and his prisoners i'm just going to read the scripture then you can sit down and be comfortable and i'll tell you the other details after this psalm 10 verse 2 the wicked and his pride doth persecute the poor let them be taken in the devices that they have imagined may the lord have the blessing to the reading of his word you can be seated so the the title pride in his prisoners came to my mind from a book i don't know if you've ever heard of the lamplighter publishers but they they go to old books that were written in the 1700s i mean even back to the 1600s that are out of print that are just tremendous stories if you've never seen lamplighter and you like to read go find lamplighter and this particular book is excellent but there's a lot of excellent books that they do pride and as prisoners and i think that's a very appropriate way of speaking about it because a person that has pride in their life i mean we all have some level of pride but a person that has pride in their life becomes a captive to that pride and actually what what ends up happening is we we will worship that and serve that pride more than will serve god and surrender our lives to god and so it's it's such a grave danger for us as believers to fall captive to pride the word pride means inordinate self-esteem and unreasonable conceit of one's own superiority and talents beauty wealth accomplishments rank or elevation in office which manifests itself in lofty heirs distance reserve and often in contempt of others so that first scripture we read the wicked in his pride does persecute the poor pride will cause a person to take advantage of people that are weaker than you so i mean i think it's so amazing how the scripture gets to the very center of the issue and it reveals the secrets of the heart you see this i'm not i'm not talking about pride out there in the world we know that's there that's that's obvious if a person's not born again they'll never be in a condition to be able to humble themselves before god but the the thing i'm talking about here is pride amongst believers pride in the church you know there's three kinds of believers in every church there's there's three kinds of believers that are surrounding uh the body of christ if you look at the kingdom of heaven the kingdom of heaven is this it's a field and there's wheat and there's tares and there's wise and foolish virgin there's all these different layers and levels of things happening in this thing called the kingdom of heaven and so tares can come in amongst the wheat and so there can be pride and and you've you've seen that where uh someone with a a a false anointing false false ministry would come in and they have such a hold on pride has such taken them captive that this is what they're this is what they constantly are operating through and by and they might have a level of charisma and be able to control people but ultimately what their god is is pride j.c rile says this let us watch against pride in every shape pride of intellect pride of wealth pride of our own goodness nothing is so likely to keep a person out of heaven and prevent them from seeing seeing christ as pride so long as we think we are something we shall never be saved let us pray for and cultivate humility let us seek to know ourselves correctly and to find out our place in the sight of a holy god that should answer everything for us right there is when you see yourself through god's eyes i don't know if any of you pray that let me see this situation through your eyes lord not through my eyes not see how about seeing yourself i should i should pray that also let me see myself in your eyes and i think when you look i don't care who you are what maturity level you have pride can come up and eat you up and just hurt and damage you and damage people around you and so it's so critical that we guard against that pride in our own gifts spirit even spiritual gifts person can get worked up about themselves oh i have this gift i have this place no remember it's a gift it's not an innate ability that you have god has made it that way but it's all it's that it's actually a gift let's see next scripture yeah psalm 10 verse 4 the wicked through pride of his countenance will not seek after god god is not in all of his thoughts pride of his countenance pride of his countenance is what does that mean countenance well the word is actually either means his face or actually his nose so the pride of his nose it doesn't fit for our american dialect but what does it mean in other words a person can they have their appearance that they see of themself and so you know they wouldn't want to come to the altar crying and blowing snot bubbles because they're repenting before the lord they they want to be in a they want to be in a condition where everybody sees them prim proper and exactly fit the right way i'm strong i don't need anyone's help i don't need everyone's strength so what is what is what is their focus it's their outward appearance it's not their heart and god but it's an outward appearance this is a great danger this says will not seek after god god is not in all his thoughts well you think that's maybe an atheist right no it's not an atheist it's a religious person because they can they can they don't put god first doesn't mean god is not ever in their thoughts it means that in in the center of their thoughts god is not in the center is in the not in the midst he's not the purpose behind all of their thinking i remember jesus and i probably mentioned this the last four times i've preached but remember jesus talks about the motive of why you're doing something you he says if you're doing it to be seen by people you have real reward right because you did it to see people people saw you do it there you go that's your reward but we're not to be like the pharisees we're not to be like the gentiles we're to be like jesus christ and why do we what is our motive what is in our heart to please god to glorify god to see god move in people's lives and we do that in secret not wanting we don't care about being seen we don't care about getting recognition or someone patting us on the back we just care about god and god's people being helped and blessed that should be our heart and that should be our motive whether we're kicked to the side kicked to the curb people mistreat us i mean it doesn't get much more mistreatment than what jesus got and what did he do and in the in the very last thing when he was dying he said father forgive them he prayed for them and so let that be our hearts regardless of whether we have recognition regard regardless if anyone says hey you did a great job or said nothing it's not what we're doing it for we're doing it for his glory psalm 59 verse 12 for the sin of their mouth and the words of their lips let them even be taken in their pride and for cursing and lying which they speak my goodness look at what end pride brings brings to you that's pride in the heart leads a person cursing and lying they'd rather lie and make and maintain the pride that they have in themselves then speak the truth just humble yourself confess i made a mistake i did this wrong whatever it was just be humble enough you don't have to have pride as your motive how i look as my motive how you look is not going to have any impact on god if that's what you're worried about if if your own value and other other people's eyes is what you're working for pushing for trying to get that's a stink in god's nostrils god god cares how you look right but he wants it to be from your heart if your heart is right then he'll take care of the rest because how we look that's our testimony but you're going to have no greater testimony many times i've i remember being at work and you tell your boss something and you immediately you're condemned because you told him half the truth and i've gone to him and i knew i was going to be in trouble and said i didn't exactly tell you the 100 truth i told you half the truth this is the case and i am so sorry i i didn't do that and i'm so sorry and you know what that actually elevated me higher in the person's sight just by humbling myself and say i was wrong i didn't tell the whole truth forgive me over and over again it caused them to see me as more honest than i really was and so lord help us just humble ourselves because it's part of our testimony part a huge part of our testimony all right psalm 73 verse 6 therefore pride can pass it them about as a chain violence covers them as a garment i mean you talk about pride that is prisoners pride compasses them what does compass mean surrounds them i mean you think about you're you're the one that's in the center and there's an army surrounding surrounding you you're all you're completely alone and what is that pride pride is surrounding you and what is that your freedom is gone right your freedom in christ is gone your ability to do anything for the lord is gone oh yeah you you might be doing something you might be going forward you might be in the appearance that you're doing something for god but you're not doing anything for god you're literally a captive to pride and that's what a danger what a danger because you can look just exactly like everybody else but the reality is that pro pride has you as a captive and then of course the next thing that happens is violence violence covers them as a garment so when pride takes you captive the next thing is violence it might not be violent violence of fists but violence of words violence of gossip violence of false accusations and so forth why because you are losing your position your appearance before everyone so you should go and destroy other people so because that brings you higher in your own head it brings you lower it destroys you you're ruining yourself that's you're captive you're captive when pride cometh then cometh shame but with the lowly is wisdom in god's eyes pride leads us to disgrace many times it doesn't lead us to disgrace in other people's eyes but for sure in god's eyes he says what a disgraceful creature what are you going after your own pride for you're living and walking in your own pride but with the lowly with the with the humble someone that keeps him he understands who he is in christ that doesn't humility doesn't mean you think you're nothing you you know who you are in christ but you realize your desperate constant continual need for him to cleanse your heart humility is wisdom why is it wisdom same the reason is the fear of the lord is the beginning of wisdom because you recognize truly your position and your desperate need for god proverbs 13 10 only by pride cometh contention but with the well advised is wisdom i love that so through pride fighting fighting happens fights in the church disagreements amongst amongst ourselves fussing with one another what does it start from pride pride of our own opinion pride of our i own our own ideas pride of how we think things should be done hey i'm guilty you know and and it it leads to fighting and fussing but with the well advised is is wisdom in other words you understand yourself you have people around you that say uh be careful watch what you're doing watch where you're going you're you're embracing and going after pride it's not the right way proverbs 14 3 in the mouth of the foolish is a rod of pride but the lips of the wise shall preserve them so the mouth of the foolish is a rod of pride what is a rod used for for use for beating people right and so the rod of pride then is the mouth so how careful we need to be with our mouth many times we don't use our mouth the right way and what does it happen it shows that there's a rod of pride coming out of your mouth with jesus there's a sword coming out right a fiery sword that's coming out which is the word of god that discerns the thoughts and intents of the heart but with the foolish there's a rod coming out of their mouth beating people upside the head over and over again what a danger what a grave danger proverbs 16 18-19 very familiar verse often misquoted pride goeth before destruction and a haughty spirit before a fall better is to be of a humble spirit with the lowly than to divide the spoil with the proud it'd be better to lose and stay humble than it would be to win the battle and be so proud of yourself and your own accomplishments and be better off you'd be more pleasing to god to be a humble loser the the pro than a prideful winner you'd be better off to have no position in the church and just be humble than you would to be having a position and have a heart full of pride why because you lose you have a position but you lose you lose out on god's blessing and this is god's heart you know and we'll see this as we go forward in some of the scriptures through the through the prophets pride goes before destruction and a holy spirit before a fall you know this is this is one of those spiritual principles um many times it happens in this life but sometimes it doesn't happen to people in their life it happens right at the end of their life and it happens in the world to come because suffering torments sometimes the pride the proud they grow to ceos and the best positions the best places the highest positions in this world and in churches and in all kinds of places but ultimately destruction is following them destruction of their homes their families their lives now i'm not saying that they lose their money they lose their position they might they might not but ultimately is what's happening around them is destruction their family is destroyed their lives are destroyed people around them destroyed that's why you see over and over again rich billionaires and highly successful millionaire pastors or they're divorced and remarried why because destruction is going before them wherever they go all right isaiah 23 29 oh did i double up i doubled up no i didn't a man's pride shall bring him low but honor shall uphold the humble in spirit again the way brother branham says the way up is down the way down is up if if you want to go up then like brother branham talks about that preacher he went up to the pulpit all proud proud of himself and he went down and he was humiliated but the true heart is to go up and say lord i i can't help these people i don't have any i don't have anything special in myself it's just your word and it's your spirit that can help them just use me use me to help help and be a blessing and be a strengthening to them honor shall uphold the humble in spirit someone who has a humble spirit in god's eyes is honored and in the in the eyes of true holy ghost filled believers will also be honored and that will be your great testimony humility is actually the if you think about it deeply it's the root of all godly virtues without humility all virtues that you might have in your life are corrupted when there's pride you know love joy peace patience kindness goodness gentleness self-control you might have a modicum of that but pride will come through and corrupt that you know ruin the ruin that be like a disease to ruin the apples you got apples on your tree bearing fruit absolutely but man they sure ain't worth eating they're rotten and so we don't want that we want humility to be at the root and to be that sap that comes in and have a beautiful shining glorious apple that tastes so delicious in god's sight that's what we want to be but it starts with that humility all right here we go isaiah 23 9 the lord of hosts has purposed it to stain the pride of all glory and to bring into contempt all the honorable of the earth my goodness what a statement the lord of hosts has purposed this god has counseled with his own self you know the scripture in ephesians chapter one he's counseled with himself and he has set forth this decision i'm going to stain the pride of all glory let's let's stay far away from pride you better you better search your heart i better search my heart it's not something to go along in our lives and just whistle through the graveyard thinking everything's all right and i'm all right are you staining are you going to be are you going to be stained or is god going to polish you with humility god's going to polish you and let you shine but here god says i'm going to stain you and really when you look at it what is he going to he's going to stain you with blood that's that's a harsh thing to say but as we go along in the scriptures you'll see it to stain the pride of all glory and to bring into contempt all the honorable all the proud people on the earth that are honorable in the earth's eyes isaiah 25 11 he shall spread forth his hands in the midst of them as he swimeth spreadeth forth his hands to swim and he shall bring down their pride together with the spoils of their hands again this is god's heart towards pride and you'll see it over and over again i'm going to skip that one jeremiah 49 16 thy terribleness hath deceived thee in the pride of thine heart oh thou that dwelleth in the clefts of the rock that hold us the height of the hill though thou shouldest make thy nest as high as the eagle i will bring thee down from thence saith the lord you see rich people making all kinds of hiding places and plans if society falls apart and god says you can hide yourself wherever you want to i'm going to find you and i'm going to destroy you so i don't want to be in that position where god is becoming a mighty mighty hunter to find me so he can thrust me through with his sword that's god's attitude and heart towards pride skip that um let me go back mark 7 20 through 23 and he said that which cometh out of the man that defiles the man for from within out of the heart of men precede evil thoughts adulteries fornications murders thefts covetousness wickedness deceit lasciviousness an evil eye blasphemy pride foolishness all these evil things come from within and defile the man pride of heart pride of heart will defile you because it comes out of your heart and defiles you not the food that you not eating a little bit of pulled pork that's not gonna that's not gonna defile you right because that comes from the outside comes in and goes into the drought as jesus said right but it's what's from the inside it's good though brother joe yeah so it's what comes from the heart that actually defiles a man all right first timothy 3 6 he must not be a recent convert or maybe come puffed up with conceit and fall into the condemnation of the devil i'm not looking necessarily at the surrounding context of that regarding deacons and and overseers but more so looking at that becoming puffed up with conceit it'd be better like i said before it'd be better just to take take a humble lowly place take the lowest seat right that's what jesus said to do take the lowest seat then to become puffed up conceited over what position or place you have first john 2 16 for all that is in the world the desires of the flesh and the desires of the eye and pride of life is not from the father but is from the world the pro that pride is not it's not of god it's not of god it's not the nature of god god is against it god hates that pride psalm 12 3 the lord shall cut off all flattering lips and the tongue that speaks proud things i mean think about what that means for a second god's going to cut off all flattering lips and that's brutal that's a brutal statement but it's the truth god will cut off everyone that acts with with pride psalm 94 2 lift up thyself thou judge of the earth render a reward to the proud proverbs 16 5 everyone that is proud and heart is an abomination to the lord though hand joyed in hand he shall not be unpunished though people agree together to operate in their pride a pride in unity god says it's an abomination makes him sick he hates it james 4 6 but he giveth more grace wherefore he saith god resists the proud but gives grace unto the humble god actually if you look at this verse he sets himself in battle array he girds his sword that's what he's that's what it's talking about when he says resist we think resist is like the proud is pushing back and god is just like i'm trying to push against this guy's pride that's not what it's saying he's saying god actually sets himself in battle against the proud he looks at the crowd and says i'm taking out my sword and i'm going to fight how would you like do we want to be in that position do we want to have pride in our heart again the problem with pride is pride put you know they put blinders on a horse that's pride on a christian you can't see it you think you're humble enough i think that's i one of my quotes that we put in later there's no better proof that you're bound by pride than to think i'm humble enough amen this is god's heart this is the heart of the matter when you're living with pride when you're operating by pride when you're making decisions by pride when you deal with others with pride god is not your friend you still be a christian you're saved but in your operation of your life you're in a position where god is going to come against you and resist you and if you're predestinated seed god will break you down god will not stop at any length to break you down that's your health your body your mind whatever it might be god's gonna you might lose everything you might lose everything but god is going to have you humble if you're not predestinated seed you're just going to go on you say don't matter i'm humble enough you're never humble enough in god's eyes i don't know why this is on my mind i've really got to close but this statement and i probably have said this before but this statement you know i feel like i'm just not enough i hate that so much i feel like pride is that self-pride is at its center of that you are not enough i just set the record straight you're not enough you'll never be enough that's not that's why jesus came that's why we're christians that's why god changed our life is because you're not enough and you never will be enough but jesus christ is enough let's humble ourselves
