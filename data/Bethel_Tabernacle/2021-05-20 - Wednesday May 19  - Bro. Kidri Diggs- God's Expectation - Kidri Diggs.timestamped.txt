[30:29] amen amen if you have your bibles let's
[30:31] turn to genesis the
[30:33] third chapter
[30:40] no i'm sorry let's let's go to genesis
[30:48] 1.
[30:50] appreciate all the songs amen genesis
[30:53] chapter one
[30:56] we're going to read a familiar verse
[31:01] scripture if you want to say a bright
[31:04] scripture
[31:06] you know that it took a end-time prophet
[31:08] to come and
[31:10] open up to us and let us see
[31:14] what god was thinking amen
[31:18] amen genesis 1. let's start at verse 26.
[31:23] the bible says and god said let us make
[31:26] man
[31:26] in our image after our likeness and let
[31:30] them have dominion over the fish of the
[31:33] sea
[31:34] over the files of the air over the
[31:37] cattle
[31:38] and over all the earth and over every
[31:41] creeping thing
[31:42] that creepeth upon the earth verse 27
[31:46] so god created man in his own image
[31:51] in the image of god created he him
[31:55] male and female
[31:59] created he them and god
[32:02] blessed them and god said unto them be
[32:06] fruitful
[32:07] and multiply and replenish the earth
[32:10] and subdue it and have dominion over the
[32:14] fish
[32:14] of the sea and over the father of the
[32:17] air
[32:18] and over everything that moveth
[32:21] upon the earth my that's a full dominion
[32:24] right
[32:25] say over everything that moves oh my
[32:28] what almighty god let's go to um
[32:31] luke chapter seven
[32:50] luke chapter seven
[32:56] let's start at um
[33:00] let's just start at verse verse uh eight
[33:04] luke seven and eight
[33:07] and we know this is the centurion
[33:11] talking with jesus for i also am a man
[33:15] set under authority having under me
[33:18] soldiers
[33:18] and i say unto one go and he goeth
[33:22] into another come and he cometh and to
[33:25] my servant do this
[33:26] and he do it when jesus heard these
[33:28] things he
[33:29] marveled at him and turned
[33:32] him about and said unto the people that
[33:35] followed him
[33:36] i say unto you i have not found so great
[33:40] faith no not in israel and they that
[33:44] were sent returned to the house found
[33:47] the servant
[33:48] whole that had been sick amen
[33:52] lord bless reading of his word you can
[33:54] have your seats
[33:58] my thought by the grace of god and i
[34:00] desire your prayers and your pull
[34:03] my thought tonight is god's expectation
[34:07] you know and you know if you if we could
[34:09] just
[34:10] think for a second that the word
[34:13] expectation i don't
[34:15] literally have the definition before me
[34:16] but we know what it means to be
[34:18] expecting something
[34:20] that means you're looking for it and all
[34:23] the time
[34:24] as believers we're expecting something
[34:26] from god
[34:27] because his word is his word his word
[34:30] can lie
[34:31] he can't take it back it'll perform what
[34:33] he sent it out to do
[34:35] so we're always expecting of god but i
[34:38] kind of want to turn it around tonight
[34:40] and let's look at god's expectation i
[34:43] want you to know
[34:44] as a as a member of god's family that
[34:48] he is also expecting something out of
[34:50] you
[34:51] you know as a parent you pour in and
[34:53] pour in
[34:54] to your family or pour into your
[34:56] children or pour in
[34:58] you know to that life to a place to
[35:00] where you're expecting something back
[35:02] from all that you're giving out amen and
[35:05] we know that god
[35:07] he's he's looking upon his creation and
[35:10] he
[35:10] knows what you're supposed to be he
[35:13] knows what you're supposed to produce
[35:16] and he's not going to stop until he get
[35:18] it hallelujah
[35:19] so god i want you to catch this now
[35:21] church
[35:22] god is expecting something out of you
[35:25] so this is not a day where you could
[35:27] just lay back and say
[35:29] praise god i'm a christian no
[35:32] the father is pouring all into you
[35:35] so he can weep back out of you amen you
[35:38] know the scripture says that
[35:40] he's gonna uh reap in places he hadn't
[35:43] sold
[35:44] so who's doing the showing you are
[35:47] hallelujah
[35:48] and god is expecting amen but you know
[35:51] if you go back to the book of genesis
[35:53] you know and we look at god his his
[35:56] relationship with man
[35:58] and when god created man the bible says
[36:01] he says let us make man in our own image
[36:03] after our likeness let them have
[36:05] dominion
[36:06] god's expectation of you was not to be
[36:10] the head nor the tale
[36:11] his expectation was for you to be a
[36:14] ruler hallelujah
[36:16] for you to have dominion amen if i can
[36:18] make it simple
[36:19] dominion over your finances hallelujah
[36:23] dominion over your body dominion over
[36:26] your mind
[36:27] hallelujah dominion over the problems
[36:29] that may easily beset you
[36:31] according to the scripture you're
[36:33] supposed to dominate
[36:35] all right hallelujah why don't we always
[36:38] hallelujah
[36:39] run to god and say lord i need you this
[36:41] i need you that
[36:42] he already is expecting you to be in a
[36:45] position
[36:46] he's expecting us to be in a place where
[36:49] we shouldn't even have to come and ask
[36:50] him
[36:53] oh my do we ever think like that
[36:58] that god is looking at us and he's
[37:01] saying
[37:01] why are you asking me
[37:04] i've already given you dominion i've
[37:07] already given you a right
[37:09] church you have a birthright to ask for
[37:12] what you asked for
[37:13] hallelujah look he says and i hope this
[37:16] encourages you tonight and by god's
[37:19] grace i ain't gonna be long y'all know
[37:20] i'm about to close
[37:21] but look he says now this this this is
[37:24] what he gave to men he said now we're
[37:27] creating his image and his likeness
[37:29] and let them have dominion over the fish
[37:31] hallelujah
[37:32] over the sea so i
[37:35] according to the scripture i got
[37:37] dominion over water
[37:40] all right i said about these ain't no
[37:41] fish but i got dominion over it
[37:43] according to the scripture i got
[37:45] dominion over sharks
[37:47] the meaning of whales everything that's
[37:49] in that ocean hallelujah
[37:51] it has to obey my voice in the right
[37:53] context
[37:56] come on with me now church he says
[37:59] uh and over the fowls of the air
[38:02] and over the cattle and overnight we've
[38:05] seen that in the prophet's ministry
[38:06] hallelujah
[38:07] at a time where he was going to pray for
[38:10] somebody
[38:10] and and and and and he
[38:14] he left his gun in the car and there was
[38:16] a killer bull
[38:17] don't we understand god put him in that
[38:20] position
[38:21] god put him in that place because he was
[38:24] expecting something
[38:25] to come out of that prophet in that
[38:27] moment that he didn't even know that he
[38:29] possessed
[38:30] but god knew it was there god knew
[38:33] hallelujah
[38:34] in the right moment in the right time
[38:36] he'd be able to speak to creation
[38:38] just like he did in genesis 1 26
[38:42] sin did not change the word sin did not
[38:45] change the
[38:46] promise of god hallelujah and right
[38:48] there in that moment
[38:50] god would allow us to get in certain
[38:52] situations
[38:53] certain places certain positions just
[38:56] because he's expecting something has
[39:00] nothing to do with you
[39:01] and your failures it has to do with what
[39:03] god's seen
[39:05] before the foundation of the world let
[39:07] me say it like this
[39:08] god knows the capability of his seed
[39:13] he knows what that seed can do he knows
[39:15] the progression of that seed
[39:17] he knows the power of that life and that
[39:20] life is in you
[39:21] he's not expecting anything less
[39:24] but a child of god amen
[39:29] he don't put you in a position
[39:31] hallelujah that you might fail
[39:33] no he's looking for himself he's looking
[39:36] for those traits
[39:37] of that seed to come out of you in that
[39:40] situation
[39:44] now look i had to learn this
[39:49] god can easily stop things but he'll let
[39:53] it go on
[39:54] because he's expecting a certain kind of
[39:56] character
[39:58] so he'll let trials and tribulations and
[40:02] sickness and heartache and pain and all
[40:04] these things
[40:05] come upon you because he's expecting you
[40:07] to come over here
[40:10] he's expecting you to overcome it
[40:12] hallelujah
[40:13] he's expecting you to mature into his
[40:16] now i'm about to say something they're
[40:18] gonna shake your boots he's expecting
[40:20] you to come into
[40:21] his divine nature
[40:24] [Music]
[40:27] oh my he's expecting when he sees you
[40:31] to see all of his attributes to see his
[40:34] character
[40:35] to hear his own voice
[40:40] think about the church let's look at the
[40:43] level of god's expectation
[40:46] when he created adam there was no doubt
[40:49] in what he created
[40:52] god wasn't doubting adam in one bit
[40:55] one form one in nothing god was so
[40:58] confident in what he had created he just
[41:02] turned adam loose and say
[41:03] go do what you do
[41:07] hallelujah that was god's expectation
[41:11] god knew when he created adam he created
[41:14] an amateur god
[41:17] so what did he do he put him in a
[41:19] position
[41:20] where he could be a god so he told
[41:23] adam because of god's expectation he
[41:26] said adam
[41:27] i will bring all the animals to you and
[41:29] you name them
[41:30] why because god knew he had the ability
[41:32] to do that
[41:35] he had god's mind god's thought pattern
[41:39] he wouldn't name anything that god would
[41:41] name it
[41:42] and you know hallelujah that same
[41:45] expectation that god had trickled down
[41:49] through the ages hallelujah
[41:50] and you know he put he put brother
[41:52] branham in a position
[41:54] hallelujah it seemed like it was
[41:55] something hard a tough day
[41:58] he left his god he was going to pray and
[42:00] all these things and
[42:01] he saw a killer bull coming his first
[42:04] reaction
[42:05] was to shoot it but that was what god
[42:06] was expecting
[42:09] god wasn't looking for no gun to be
[42:10] fired that day
[42:12] hallelujah well let me let me let me
[42:14] backtrack a little bit
[42:16] no his first the prophet's first
[42:19] expression
[42:20] was to run god ain't looking for runners
[42:23] no more
[42:24] his seed is not a runner his seed is
[42:27] supposed to have dominion
[42:29] hallelujah you're supposed to stand
[42:31] right up to it
[42:32] and be what god made you all right
[42:36] now i'm not boasting hallelujah i'm just
[42:38] talking about what god
[42:39] said hallelujah in church
[42:42] he wanted to run but then he looked
[42:45] hallelujah
[42:46] how far the fist was and he knew he
[42:48] could make it
[42:49] his next instinct as a man was to shoot
[42:52] it
[42:53] but god made sure he left the gun in the
[42:55] car
[42:56] what was god expecting god was expecting
[42:59] him
[43:00] to be genesis 1 26
[43:04] so god would allow you to get in places
[43:07] so you can go back to your origin
[43:10] so you can go back you can fulfill his
[43:13] expectation
[43:14] wow hallelujah god's not looking for us
[43:17] to operate as a carnal human being he's
[43:20] looking for us to be what he created
[43:25] wasn't looking for a track star
[43:28] he wasn't looking for a marksman he was
[43:31] looking for his child
[43:33] he was looking for that god he created
[43:39] amen
[43:40] and that's what he's looking for when
[43:42] you go through things
[43:44] that's his expectation
[43:48] hallelujah and look the prophet didn't
[43:52] even know that was in him
[43:55] so god put him in position so he could
[43:58] come out
[43:59] because god wasn't expecting anything
[44:01] less he created man
[44:04] to have dominion
[44:07] over a killer bull oh
[44:11] and this bull was untamed let me tell
[44:14] you something
[44:15] church sin did not
[44:18] change what god is expecting
[44:23] he's still expecting you to be his son
[44:27] to be his daughter
[44:29] to be a god child and are you looking at
[44:32] the prophet
[44:34] in that moment what happens god begins
[44:37] to
[44:38] cover him god begins to come down
[44:42] and bruise over his creation again just
[44:44] like he did in genesis hallelujah
[44:47] amen and that seed of faith that was
[44:50] laying dormant there
[44:51] it began to come out in this place
[44:53] hallelujah
[44:55] why the light hallelujah and the life of
[44:58] that seed
[44:58] began to connect and all it could do was
[45:01] produce the supernatural
[45:03] just like he did when he said let there
[45:05] be
[45:06] now you look in that moment what was
[45:08] happening the prophet began to speak
[45:10] hallelujah
[45:11] and as he spoke everything he said was
[45:13] just like
[45:14] let there be what was happening that was
[45:17] god's expectation
[45:19] church i want to encourage you you can't
[45:22] be nothing but what god wants you to be
[45:24] and what he wants us to be is children
[45:27] of god
[45:28] [Applause]
[45:29] he don't want us to just settle for a
[45:31] plumber or baker or a teacher
[45:33] or whatever he wants you to be his child
[45:37] wow amen
[45:40] although the prophet was good at hunting
[45:43] he was good at boxing he was good at all
[45:46] these things
[45:47] but that wasn't what god created amen
[45:50] hallelujah the fall made him a good
[45:53] hunter
[45:56] are you with me that wasn't god's
[45:58] original
[45:59] uh concept of why he made him he didn't
[46:02] create the prophet
[46:03] just to be a good marksman he didn't
[46:05] create him to be a
[46:07] good herdsmen or a gamesman no he
[46:09] created him hallelujah
[46:10] to fulfill his expectation
[46:15] and that's why we are created to fulfill
[46:19] god's expectation and little church
[46:22] even after adam fell god
[46:25] he made a way where man could stay in
[46:28] that channel hallelujah
[46:30] because god continually expected
[46:33] something from man
[46:35] so look at the grace of god god's never
[46:38] going to lower his standards
[46:41] for you and i know he's expecting the
[46:43] greatness of the great to come out of
[46:45] you
[46:46] hallelujah through every trial through
[46:48] every situation
[46:50] he knows what's inside there you know i
[46:53] was telling you my daughter was riding
[46:54] down the road and you know i was
[46:56] thinking about a farmer
[46:58] you know when a farmer he plants his
[46:59] seed
[47:01] there's a certain kind of life he's
[47:02] looking for hallelujah
[47:05] somebody talked to me that that when
[47:07] that farmer plants apples
[47:09] he's not looking for oranges he knows
[47:12] exactly
[47:13] the life which he hallelujah
[47:16] it doesn't matter how dark the dirt is
[47:18] how rich the dirt is
[47:20] he's worried about that life that he
[47:22] planted coming forth
[47:24] there's a season there's a time that
[47:27] he's looking forward to bust through all
[47:28] that dirt
[47:29] and be what he planted he's expecting
[47:32] something
[47:34] whether it rains hard whether it rains
[47:36] tough he's still expecting something
[47:39] hallelujah whether it's snows oh yeah
[47:42] where the ice comes down
[47:43] he's still expecting something in that
[47:46] season
[47:48] churchill you don't want to be a person
[47:50] just because you feel like it's out of
[47:51] season
[47:52] you don't give god what he wants
[47:57] cause he already broke that chain
[48:00] remember
[48:00] he walked up to a fig tree and it looked
[48:03] like he was out of season
[48:04] but that fig tree didn't realize it was
[48:07] god saying give me some of you
[48:09] amen amen he was expecting figs
[48:15] should we say bro jesus wasn't a season
[48:16] we were dealing with god
[48:19] we were dealing with the one who created
[48:20] the tree
[48:22] and because the tree in that moment
[48:25] because it was caught in traditions
[48:27] hallelujah
[48:28] it couldn't give god what he wanted god
[48:31] cursed the tree why
[48:32] because he was expecting things
[48:38] what about you tonight what is god
[48:41] expecting
[48:43] holy he's expecting us to fulfill his
[48:45] word
[48:47] through the channel of faith hallelujah
[48:51] but let's read a little bit more oh
[48:54] my i hope you're encouraged tonight
[49:00] see even in that thought let me go back
[49:04] even in that thought he's just dealing
[49:07] with the prophet
[49:09] we're trying on beings and god loves to
[49:12] show us
[49:14] that it's the soul of man that counts
[49:18] although your spirit is good your body
[49:20] is good but who you really
[49:22] are is in your soul so a lot of times
[49:25] god will put you in places
[49:28] so the real you can come out
[49:31] wow hallelujah let's go back to it amen
[49:34] the first thing the prophet said i can
[49:36] run that was his body
[49:39] amen next thing he said well maybe i can
[49:43] shoot it that was his spirit hallelujah
[49:46] but then he said he felt the nature of
[49:47] god come down
[49:49] he felt the love come down and he began
[49:51] to talk to creation
[49:52] what was happening he was connecting
[49:54] with that gene sheet of god
[49:57] he was connecting in the soul realm
[49:59] hallelujah
[50:00] and in his soul he was a god so he began
[50:03] to talk like one
[50:04] he said i'm a servant of god you're a
[50:06] creature of god i got to go pray for
[50:08] another servant
[50:09] now you go back over there and lay down
[50:16] why did it happen that way because god
[50:18] was expecting that to happen
[50:23] god is constantly through the scriptures
[50:27] reminding his children who they are
[50:31] by his expectation he had to constantly
[50:35] do that
[50:36] because we're living in a body of death
[50:38] and sometimes the body of
[50:40] death it clouds out what's really on the
[50:43] inside
[50:44] holy he had to do that with abraham
[50:46] hallelujah
[50:48] he had to tell abraham you're the father
[50:50] of faith hallelujah
[50:51] abraham didn't even knew it but but but
[50:54] he began to
[50:55] tell abraham about genesis 1 26
[50:58] he said there are nations inside of you
[51:00] hallelujah
[51:01] your seed is going to shine like the
[51:03] stars it's going to be like the sun
[51:05] he said you look as far as the east to
[51:07] the west the north or the south
[51:09] so shall your seed be what was he doing
[51:12] he was putting him under his expectation
[51:20] and that was a growing process because
[51:22] all abraham could see
[51:24] was his failure hallelujah so god will
[51:26] continuously hallelujah
[51:28] put him in a position where he would
[51:30] fail but god's expectation didn't change
[51:40] that's the grace of god
[51:43] but we constantly fail god but his
[51:46] expectation of us
[51:48] never changes because he knows what
[51:51] you're capable of
[51:54] hallelujah abraham brings light alone
[51:56] they fuss and they fight
[51:58] light goes into sodom and now god says
[52:00] abraham i'ma give you a glimpse of who
[52:02] you are
[52:04] hallelujah i'm going to give you a
[52:05] glimpse of what's really on the side of
[52:07] you
[52:07] he says i want you to take 318 untrained
[52:11] servants
[52:11] and go down there and whip them kings up
[52:13] real good
[52:15] why because jesus said you're supposed
[52:17] to have dominion
[52:19] over the fish over the sea over the
[52:21] cattle
[52:22] and everything on the earth amen amen
[52:28] oh my so abraham goes down there
[52:31] he whips up on the kings real bad take
[52:33] lot
[52:34] back hallelujah lot was never any
[52:36] benefit for it
[52:37] hallelujah so why why lie why was god
[52:41] hallelujah
[52:42] using abraham to go get lot because god
[52:45] had to show
[52:46] hallelujah who he really was through us
[52:49] amen
[52:50] hallelujah right there in abraham he's
[52:52] showing that he's a kinsmen redeemer
[52:56] because even when he's wrong god made a
[52:59] way that lot could be redeemed
[53:01] amen it was his fault that he was down
[53:04] in sodom
[53:04] he chose that way but god's expectation
[53:08] the grace of god coming through him
[53:11] through abraham
[53:12] saved the man in his wrongdoing
[53:16] amen how do you respond when people do
[53:20] you wrong
[53:21] he's expecting you hallelujah to be a
[53:24] chip off the old block
[53:30] and we know the scripture says the sins
[53:34] of sodom
[53:35] vex light righteous soul and when you
[53:38] read about lot
[53:39] there was nothing righteous about life
[53:41] what made him righteous
[53:43] abraham's prayer
[53:47] amen because abraham was constantly
[53:50] interceding for him he let the scripture
[53:54] the scripture say that a righteous
[53:56] person can make a a wicked person
[53:57] righteous holy
[53:59] and the scripture also says whoever sins
[54:01] you remit they'll be remembered
[54:06] whoever sends you retain they'll be
[54:07] retained hallelujah
[54:09] that's god's expectation holy you know
[54:11] their problem with jesus
[54:12] was that jesus wasn't just doing good
[54:15] miracles but he was saying i'm god
[54:20] and that's the problem people have with
[54:22] this message
[54:23] because we act like we're children of
[54:25] god
[54:26] hallelujah you notice they don't have a
[54:29] problem with brother branham gift
[54:30] they don't have a problem with the
[54:31] healing line and all these things but
[54:33] when it gets down to god's thoughts
[54:35] and the mind of god that's when people
[54:37] have a problem
[54:38] [Applause]
[54:40] when you can look in the scripture and
[54:42] you say i'm supposed to act like this
[54:44] i'm supposed to do that because god is a
[54:46] holy god he's a righteous god
[54:48] i want to be his expectation
[54:51] god's expectation of you and i is holy
[54:56] amen
[55:00] his expectation of you and i is faithful
[55:04] righteous oh powerful
[55:08] that's his expectation i hope this stirs
[55:12] you up just enough

[55:57] were created as images likeness
[55:59] you know we have demeanor the fish so on
[56:01] and so on and all that
[56:03] but then you go on verse 27 saying god
[56:07] created man in his own image in his
[56:10] image of god created he him
[56:11] male and female created he them and god

[56:42] flowing through me hallelujah all right
[56:44] you're supposed to say amen to the word

[57:08] amen and we look at people and we see
[57:11] that they're blessed and
[57:12] god bless everything they touch us and
[57:14] the spirit of jealousy rises up
[57:17] that ain't god expectation god's
[57:20] expectations for you to be grateful

[57:53] hallelujah
[57:55] look church god did not change his word
[57:59] everything he said about us still
[58:00] remains to the day
[58:04] let's keep reading everybody all right
[58:12] it never fails
[58:16] i come and say i'm just preaching a nice
[58:17] message tonight i ain't gonna sweat
[58:22] but that wasn't god's expectation
[58:25] god knew when i started talking about
[58:27] this thought some of you were gonna get
[58:29] on the edge of your seat
[58:30] and you were gonna start pulling
[58:32] hallelujah and everything that i had
[58:34] planned was gonna go out the window
[58:36] because you and your spirit you're

[58:50] atmospheres hallelujah
[58:52] your theophany becomes real
[58:54] [Applause]
[58:55] it's not just a good quote that ain't
[58:57] your flesh saying hey man
[58:59] that's your word body so even though you
[59:02] may be sitting in this natural rim
[59:04] your theophany every time you come to
[59:06] church or every time you hear some good
[59:08] preaching
[59:08] it comes near hallelujah because he said
[59:11] that theology is saying
[59:13] he's talking about me and god's
[59:15] expectation
[59:16] is for you to know that you have
[59:18] representation in heaven
[59:22] how do you know that by your amends
[59:33] because remember the scripture says
[59:34] flesh and blood shall not inherit the
[59:36] kingdom of god
[59:38] so they hate your natural man saying
[59:40] amen i know that in my mind no
[59:42] that's the visitation of your theophany
[59:46] coming close to you tapping you on the
[59:49] shoulder
[59:50] hey man while i'm preaching run up on
[59:51] you and say
[59:53] say amen
[59:57] where's that nudge coming from are they
[59:59] coming from me hallelujah
[1:00:02] is there something pushing them amens
[1:00:04] out of you it ain't me doing it what is
[1:00:06] it
[1:00:06] it's your spiritual representation
[1:00:10] it's god's expectation hallelujah god
[1:00:13] sending those theophanies down saying
[1:00:15] all right it's a thirst night
[1:00:16] go stand in your position
[1:00:21] amen and i want i want you to know this
[1:00:23] church that your theophany
[1:00:25] is not sitting on your lap it's that
[1:00:28] attention
[1:00:30] amen because it cannot help hallelujah
[1:00:33] but worship in the presence of god that
[1:00:36] word body holy

[1:01:30] and his expectation
[1:01:31] to me he's worth more than a god

[1:01:46] worship holy adoration

[1:07:40] she got a splash from god that was god's
[1:07:44] expectation earlier
[1:07:46] for her to get sick and then get a
[1:07:48] visitation from an angel

[1:10:06] oh my sound john starts shouting they

[1:10:14] he said you shout too much in church and
[1:10:16] you're making the people uncomfortable
[1:10:18] imagine that people are uncomfortable
[1:10:21] because you praise the lord
[1:10:25] you talking about a spirit
[1:10:28] looking at me while i shout judging me
[1:10:33] i wonder if it's real that ain't none of
[1:10:36] your business
[1:10:38] the only one that can determine whether
[1:10:40] it's real or not is god
[1:10:42] and the life i live when i leave here
[1:10:48] hallelujah if you ain't living right i
[1:10:50] said like they said
[1:10:52] sit down someway
[1:10:55] but if you living right and you feel
[1:10:57] like shouting i'm sure brother jason
[1:10:59] don't mind that's right
[1:11:00] hallelujah y'all might not believe this
[1:11:03] or not
[1:11:03] but jason got some of this in him
[1:11:10] isn't that he don't even have to tan
[1:11:12] he'd just come out during the summertime
[1:11:20] sean john started shouting they said
[1:11:23] brother john you shout too much in
[1:11:24] church
[1:11:25] we can't we can't have you coming
[1:11:26] disrupting church like that he said oh
[1:11:28] yeah the people
[1:11:29] say he said yeah they said yeah the
[1:11:30] people upset john john say
[1:11:32] look at all this land i got you say you
[1:11:34] see all his land he said yeah we see it
[1:11:36] he said god gave me this land he said i
[1:11:39] got all my children all my children in
[1:11:41] church
[1:11:42] my wife saved everything all my
[1:11:43] possessions god gave it to me
[1:11:45] he said you don't want me to shout in
[1:11:46] your church he said well hold on
[1:11:51] john said hold my mute i shout right
[1:11:53] here right in your face if you don't
[1:11:55] like it
[1:11:56] i don't need your church to dance with
[1:11:58] god
[1:12:00] that's god's expectation cause you don't
[1:12:02] have to be in these walls
[1:12:04] to give god praise you don't have to be
[1:12:06] in this building
[1:12:07] to give god thanks his expectations for
[1:12:09] you to worship him wherever you go
[1:12:20] but i know some of you ain't gonna do it
[1:12:21] because you control freaks
[1:12:25] you love having control that's why
[1:12:27] people don't want the holy ghost brother
[1:12:29] mad because they love having control
[1:12:31] so you can just sit there and be all
[1:12:33] nice
[1:12:34] your favorite scripture is and it was a
[1:12:37] still small voice
[1:12:44] but what i love about that scripture god
[1:12:47] told elijah
[1:12:49] he said go stand in the mouth of the
[1:12:50] cave and i'ma come pass by
[1:12:54] and the bible says and god started to
[1:12:56] move
[1:12:57] and god's moving started an earthquake
[1:13:04] so was god in the earthquake
[1:13:08] who started the earthquake
[1:13:11] i'm just saying not the scripture
[1:13:14] you might not believe it but who was he
[1:13:16] on mount sinai
[1:13:18] he was an earthquake and he said as he
[1:13:22] began to move hallelujah
[1:13:24] there was a win god's moving did all
[1:13:28] these things
[1:13:29] what was he on the day of rushing wind
[1:13:33] and also saying there was a fire
[1:13:37] the scripture says god is a consuming
[1:13:39] fire
[1:13:40] church all three of those manifestations
[1:13:43] was a manifestation of god
[1:13:44] moving but in that moment he wanted to
[1:13:47] talk to elijah
[1:13:48] in a still small voice but the
[1:13:50] earthquake was god
[1:13:52] the wind was god and the fire was god
[1:13:55] but in that moment hallelujah his
[1:13:57] expectation was to speak in a still
[1:14:00] small voice
[1:14:02] so don't give the don't say it's not god
[1:14:04] when you see somebody
[1:14:06] experiencing an earthquake but jason the
[1:14:08] reason why they don't like an earthquake
[1:14:10] in church
[1:14:10] is because you can't control an
[1:14:12] earthquake
[1:14:14] you just gotta sit there and ride it out
[1:14:17] you just gotta sit there and hold on
[1:14:19] till it stops
[1:14:23] that's the reason why people don't like
[1:14:24] a mighty russian wind because you can't
[1:14:26] control it
[1:14:27] a real real strong wind will blow you
[1:14:29] down
[1:14:31] look what it does to the ocean when it
[1:14:32] gets to going
[1:14:35] reason why people don't like a fire
[1:14:37] hallelujah because it burns up
[1:14:39] everything in its way and brings it back
[1:14:42] to its original condition
[1:14:45] but some people want to remain what they
[1:14:47] are and god was in a fire
[1:14:50] to burn up all that filth so you could
[1:14:52] go back to what he originally created
[1:14:54] you to be
[1:14:56] a ministry of brimstone and fire
[1:14:58] hallelujah
[1:14:59] that's why people don't want this
[1:15:01] message hallelujah because the prophet
[1:15:03] was speaking
[1:15:04] fire amen
[1:15:12] we got to stop doing this we're going to
[1:15:13] set people on fire one day
[1:15:17] they're going to come down here they'll
[1:15:18] be like hey we got to stop them people
[1:15:21] we got to stop them people they doing
[1:15:22] something in the land
[1:15:24] sure let me let me let me move forward
[1:15:28] listen church in in in
[1:15:31] luke chapter seven
[1:15:36] when jesus was talking to the centurion
[1:15:39] we know the story right
[1:15:44] we know the story right
[1:15:48] hey man i know some people in here
[1:15:51] look centurion
[1:15:55] he's talking to jesus he tells jesus i'm
[1:15:58] a man like you are when i say go to go
[1:16:00] and i say do they do
[1:16:02] you know on and on and on and then he
[1:16:04] tells jesus don't even go
[1:16:07] now when you go back and read those
[1:16:08] stories what i want you to realize
[1:16:11] is jesus is coming
[1:16:15] and it's intruding he's talking to him
[1:16:17] while he's coming
[1:16:19] he's telling jesus i'm just i'm that but
[1:16:21] then he says
[1:16:23] don't even come just speak the word only
[1:16:25] am i right that's what the bible says
[1:16:27] he's telling god you even have to come
[1:16:29] down this way just speak the word only
[1:16:32] but jesus can't resist that kind of
[1:16:34] faith he's expecting that
[1:16:36] he's been searching for that so that
[1:16:39] faith is drawing him in is pulling him
[1:16:41] in
[1:16:41] because god knows what he's going to say
[1:16:43] next holy
[1:16:44] so he's expecting him to say i'm a man
[1:16:47] of like authority
[1:16:48] like pastors like you are just speak the
[1:16:50] word holy
[1:16:51] so jesus get straight down that come
[1:16:53] here brother
[1:16:56] jesus gets down there he says i want you
[1:16:58] turn this way turn this way what's your
[1:16:59] name again bro
[1:17:00] caleb he gets right here and just say
[1:17:03] caleb is a centurion
[1:17:07] and he says he says that he says hey i'm
[1:17:09] a man as you all would like precious
[1:17:11] of of same passion same faith same
[1:17:13] authority all these things
[1:17:15] and you go back and read luke the
[1:17:16] seventh chapter jesus hello
[1:17:20] he receives that faith but the
[1:17:21] expectation is so high
[1:17:23] he turns him around he says
[1:17:28] i haven't seen this kind of faith in
[1:17:31] all israel that faith
[1:17:35] got the god of glory excited
[1:17:40] you can sit down i'm gonna read i'm
[1:17:43] gonna read it to you
[1:17:45] luke 7.
[1:17:53] let's let's let's just start at verse
[1:17:55] let's start at verse 8.
[1:17:58] luke seven today he says for i also am a
[1:18:00] man set on the authority having under
[1:18:03] under me soldiers and i say unto one go
[1:18:06] and he goeth unto another
[1:18:08] come and he cometh and to my servant do
[1:18:10] this and he do it when jesus heard these
[1:18:13] things he marveled
[1:18:16] he was expecting something
[1:18:19] he marveled at him and said he marveled
[1:18:22] at him and
[1:18:23] turned him about and said unto the
[1:18:26] people that followed him
[1:18:28] i say unto you this is it
[1:18:33] that's basically what he's telling
[1:18:35] everybody that's looking holly
[1:18:36] this is what i've been expecting this is
[1:18:39] what i've been looking for hallelujah
[1:18:41] somebody who knows who they are it's not
[1:18:44] just a song
[1:18:45] but it's a revelation this man knows who
[1:18:48] he is
[1:18:49] he turns them about and he's telling
[1:18:50] everybody look on him amen
[1:18:58] he said marvel to him to turn them about
[1:19:00] and said unto the people that follow him
[1:19:02] i say unto you
[1:19:03] i have not found so great faith no not
[1:19:05] in
[1:19:06] israel god's expectation
[1:19:09] listen church in john the third chapter
[1:19:11] when jesus was saying you must be born
[1:19:13] again
[1:19:14] and he went on he was talking to the
[1:19:15] disciples you know what he said to them
[1:19:17] he said marvel not
[1:19:19] right this is what i'm expecting i'm
[1:19:22] expecting the people to be filled with
[1:19:24] the holy ghost
[1:19:26] marvel knot
[1:19:31] in matthew i believe it's the um
[1:19:35] mark the 6th to 16th chapter
[1:19:40] verse 14 he said after he appeared into
[1:19:42] the 11st
[1:19:44] that sat down and ate me and upbraided
[1:19:47] them
[1:19:47] with their unbelief see his expectation
[1:19:50] was for the church to believe
[1:19:53] hallelujah so you look at jesus hands of
[1:19:55] people that didn't believe
[1:19:57] amen he couldn't take it because he
[1:20:00] knows
[1:20:00] the life of his seed you're supposed to
[1:20:03] believe the words
[1:20:04] so the bible says he abraded them for
[1:20:07] their unbelief
[1:20:08] what that word means to scold
[1:20:11] amen basically he set them down and gave
[1:20:14] them a letter and said look
[1:20:15] you guys are better than this
[1:20:19] you guys are better than this you're
[1:20:21] supposed to believe i can walk through a
[1:20:22] wall
[1:20:28] on and on and on church his expectation
[1:20:31] of you hallelujah
[1:20:32] remember he told the saints and i'm
[1:20:34] about to close he told the saints and he
[1:20:36] said let's pray
[1:20:37] let's pray and they went to sleep he
[1:20:38] said let's pray the will to sleep and
[1:20:39] then another place he told
[1:20:41] let's go over to the other side jesus
[1:20:43] stayed back and prayed they jumped in
[1:20:44] the boat until the storm started
[1:20:46] happening
[1:20:46] jesus came walking on the water
[1:20:48] hallelujah and they said
[1:20:49] oh it's the spirit oh it's a ghost lord
[1:20:52] if it's you
[1:20:54] jesus said one thing come
[1:20:58] he wanted to show them you still got
[1:21:00] dominion over the sea
[1:21:03] amen
[1:21:06] that word didn't change as long as you
[1:21:09] keep your eyes on jesus
[1:21:11] you are genesis 1 26
[1:21:14] [Music]
[1:21:16] and as long as peter kept his eyes on
[1:21:19] christ
[1:21:20] he had dominion over the sea
[1:21:23] over the water he was walking on it
[1:21:26] just like the word of god said
[1:21:30] that was god's expectation that's why he
[1:21:32] allowed the storm
[1:21:33] to show peter who he is in the arms of
[1:21:40] jesus
[1:21:42] and in my closing in another place god's
[1:21:45] expectation
[1:21:48] church i don't know about you but he
[1:21:49] does me like this sometimes
[1:21:51] i remember i remember when i was first
[1:21:54] going
[1:21:55] full time in the ministry and i didn't
[1:21:57] want to go
[1:21:59] but god was expecting something so he
[1:22:02] started pushing me and pushing me and i
[1:22:04] was like
[1:22:05] so i finally accepted i went in quit my
[1:22:08] job
[1:22:08] took my pension from the city started
[1:22:10] evangelizing
[1:22:13] you know but i was i was just doing that
[1:22:14] because i felt like it was what i was
[1:22:16] supposed to do it wasn't a revelation
[1:22:18] if you're doing something it's not a
[1:22:20] revelation it ain't gonna last
[1:22:22] because you have to understand if god
[1:22:24] called you to something
[1:22:26] he's going to see you through it you
[1:22:28] know things got tough things got tight
[1:22:30] and you know what idea bro jason i went
[1:22:32] and got another job cause all my bills
[1:22:34] got backed up everything got backed up
[1:22:36] i went down to florida and preached
[1:22:37] preaching i was preaching doing youth
[1:22:39] meet for brother westco
[1:22:40] bill smiley brother jack and i get down
[1:22:44] there
[1:22:44] this is i've been probably evangelizing
[1:22:46] now about a year
[1:22:48] and you know things got tight bills
[1:22:49] behind everything behind
[1:22:51] and i get down and i sit in brother
[1:22:53] wesker office and he started telling me
[1:22:55] the testimony of how he became a
[1:22:57] full-time minister
[1:23:01] didn't even know what i was going
[1:23:02] through he said this was back in 77.
[1:23:08] this is like 2005 or 6 or something like
[1:23:11] that
[1:23:12] he would say god told me to go full time
[1:23:14] to ministry he said i had
[1:23:15] two years left to retire
[1:23:18] from the state he said and god told me
[1:23:21] to leave it and i'll take care of you
[1:23:23] he left it and god's been taking care of
[1:23:25] him ever since
[1:23:31] oh my church we got a currency
[1:23:34] that doesn't get old it's called faith
[1:23:38] hallelujah but he's talking to me about
[1:23:40] uh believing god
[1:23:42] full time in the ministry he's just
[1:23:43] telling me all these testimonies and
[1:23:44] stuff i didn't even
[1:23:45] ask him but god knew what i needed
[1:23:49] so i leave his office and you know i go
[1:23:51] and preaching we have church and
[1:23:52] everything is good
[1:23:53] and i i get on the road and the brother
[1:23:55] calls me he says hey brothers where you
[1:23:56] at i want to take you and your family
[1:23:58] out to eat i said man i'm gone i'm on 95
[1:24:00] north he said what you doing on 95 north
[1:24:03] i said i'm going home i got to go to
[1:24:04] work
[1:24:04] he said work man you supposed to be a
[1:24:07] full-time evangelist
[1:24:12] so god's giving me reminders of what he
[1:24:14] expects from me
[1:24:16] even though i'm running from it
[1:24:17] hallelujah but now i got this job and
[1:24:20] all these things are going on
[1:24:21] church it was like that day that weekend
[1:24:25] it was like give brother diggs money
[1:24:28] week
[1:24:31] felt like a holiday everywhere i went
[1:24:35] somebody
[1:24:35] hey everybody how you doing oh praise
[1:24:38] god
[1:24:43] i really really that that weekend i
[1:24:45] really really got acquainted with
[1:24:47] benjamin franklin
[1:24:51] everywhere i turned around me and
[1:24:52] benjamin was looking at each other
[1:24:55] jesus christ ben you again
[1:25:00] i'm so glad to see you
[1:25:05] what's somewhere into me oh brother i
[1:25:07] sure appreciate that word
[1:25:10] oh man that was so good church and by
[1:25:13] the time i got home
[1:25:14] i gathered up everything i had listen
[1:25:17] everything i gathered up
[1:25:18] you know it was enough to bring all my
[1:25:22] bills currently
[1:25:26] and god rebuked me like he did like he
[1:25:29] did the disciples
[1:25:31] say if you trust me i'll take care of
[1:25:33] you but you went and got another job
[1:25:36] so he was showing me right there in that
[1:25:37] moment trust him but y'all know we hard
[1:25:40] hit it
[1:25:43] i still wasn't quite on board so he said
[1:25:45] okay i make a deal with god i say well
[1:25:47] lord
[1:25:48] you want me to go full time you got to
[1:25:50] do something you know god got a sense of
[1:25:52] humor
[1:25:53] god said okay you want me to do
[1:25:54] something all right i'm gonna close your
[1:25:55] eyes
[1:25:56] i'm gonna make sure you can't drive no
[1:25:58] truck
[1:26:01] i'm gonna make i'm gonna make i'm gonna
[1:26:03] make it so easy and so simple
[1:26:05] your boss gonna fire you because you
[1:26:07] want to go to the eye doctor
[1:26:13] and it seemed like the safe thing to do
[1:26:15] let the man go to the eye doctor
[1:26:17] because something wrong with his eyes
[1:26:19] and he's driving a truck with 70 000
[1:26:21] pounds on it
[1:26:22] wouldn't you want that man to be able to
[1:26:23] see
[1:26:27] but my boss said you go to the eye
[1:26:28] doctor you're going to be looking for
[1:26:30] another job
[1:26:31] huh that don't even make no sense
[1:26:40] and just like he said i went to the eye
[1:26:42] doctor
[1:26:43] and i got fired
[1:26:49] and you know what who that man was it
[1:26:51] became a reality that day
[1:26:53] because you know what jokingly i used to
[1:26:54] call him pharaoh
[1:26:58] i come in that morning what you got for
[1:26:59] me today pharaoh
[1:27:04] he really became the manifestation of
[1:27:07] pharaoh
[1:27:09] fired me for trying to see
[1:27:14] and you know the grace of god the grace
[1:27:17] of god was
[1:27:18] god let it go on for at least
[1:27:22] a month and a half
[1:27:27] y'all don't believe it two witnesses
[1:27:28] back there amber after they saw me
[1:27:31] i was going down to florida to preach
[1:27:33] for brothers for brother
[1:27:35] smiley which i was trying to get out of
[1:27:37] it which he couldn't see me he was like
[1:27:38] man come on man you know we pray by the
[1:27:40] goddess and i'm like man i can't see
[1:27:45] so anyway we drove down there i got to
[1:27:48] the house
[1:27:49] they're like what's wrong with these
[1:27:50] eyes
[1:27:52] sister lewis said we gonna bind this
[1:27:53] devil up right now let's pray
[1:27:57] hardly but i had to go through something
[1:27:59] yeah see god had to let it go on as long
[1:28:02] as he did
[1:28:03] because he knew if i would have got my
[1:28:04] eyesight right back i don't want to got
[1:28:06] another job
[1:28:10] hallelujah so he let it go on and on and
[1:28:13] on and on
[1:28:14] until i got to a place where i just sit
[1:28:16] at home i say lord you know about this
[1:28:17] before the foundation of the world
[1:28:20] i say lord you knew this was going to
[1:28:21] happen he put me in this place to let me
[1:28:24] see his expectation and you know how i
[1:28:27] got healed
[1:28:29] i accepted his plan
[1:28:33] i was sitting in the house i said lord
[1:28:36] if this
[1:28:36] is your will for me to go full time in
[1:28:38] the ministry i accept
[1:28:40] and that was the last time my eyes ever
[1:28:42] closed like that
[1:28:43] they stayed open that whole day the next
[1:28:45] day the next week the next month
[1:28:46] all the way up to now just by me
[1:28:49] accepting his plan
[1:28:50] by faith just by me accepting god's
[1:28:54] expectation of me
[1:28:57] but you know i had my own reservation

[1:29:13] right church he know what he's doing i'm
[1:29:16] trying to close but maybe somebody needs

[1:39:52] god doing something in his body to get
[1:39:54] him and surrendering to the ministry
[1:39:56] see brother caleb i just i thought what
[1:39:58] a synchronization of god's mind
[1:40:01] brother dick's testifying god has his
[1:40:04] god has a way to get our attention
[1:40:06] amen if he god has a way to get us to
[1:40:08] stop
[1:40:09] and sometimes we say oh that's just the
[1:40:11] devil sometimes it's the lord the lord
[1:40:13] is who blinded brother dick's eyes
[1:40:15] because god was trying to get his
[1:40:16] attention god was doing something in his
[1:40:18] body
[1:40:19] to get him to surrender to a call in his
[1:40:21] life
[1:40:22] are you glad you served that kind of a
[1:40:24] father
[1:40:25] amen who loves you too much to leave you
[1:40:27] like you are
[1:40:29] amen praise the lord appreciated that so
[1:40:31] much tonight
[1:40:32] amen brother diggs i was reading
[1:40:34] actually last night
[1:40:36] we just did a little devotion and i was
[1:40:38] reading in the compendium
[1:40:40] just a quote book if you'd have a
[1:40:42] compendium the red books that are
[1:40:44] bound and they have a quotes upon a
[1:40:47] section
[1:40:48] and it was about attitude and brother
[1:40:49] brandon was talking about that's that uh
[1:40:52] luke chapter seven about that noble man
[1:40:54] that centurion and i love this i just
[1:40:56] thought it was so amazing
[1:40:58] brother branham says i like the attitude
[1:41:00] of that centurion tonight
[1:41:02] that we've just read about he was a man
[1:41:04] that felt
[1:41:05] unworthy didn't feel worthy he said lord
[1:41:08] i'm not even worthy that you'd come into
[1:41:10] my house
[1:41:11] but if you just speak the word he said
[1:41:13] he said he was a man that felt unworthy
[1:41:15] as long as you're feeling unworthy of
[1:41:18] the blessing you're asking for
[1:41:20] you're pretty apt to get it
[1:41:24] as long as you're feeling unworthy to
[1:41:27] even
[1:41:27] ask the lord brother adam says you're
[1:41:29] pretty apt to get it
[1:41:32] he says but when you get to a place
[1:41:34] where you think that god just owes it to
[1:41:36] you that's when you're mistaken
[1:41:38] we're in debt to god not god in debt to
[1:41:41] us
[1:41:42] he's talking about attitude say lord
[1:41:44] that's my attitude i don't even feel
[1:41:45] worthy
[1:41:46] that you'd ask me but i want to be your
[1:41:49] expectation
[1:41:50] amen praise the lord we have some needs
[1:41:52] we want to look to
[1:41:54] amen and i just want to see what we've
[1:41:56] got here
