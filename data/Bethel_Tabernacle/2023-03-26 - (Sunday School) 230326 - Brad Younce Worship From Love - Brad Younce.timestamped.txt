[0:00] Lord following his place of worship

[0:06] Sunday school lesson father than may you
[0:09] anoint the ministers he comes out later
[0:11] on Father Lord I just pray May
[0:13] everything be done be according to your
[0:15] perfect Divine will in Jesus name amen
[0:19] if you have your Bibles you can turn to
[0:21] Psalms 103
[0:23] and verse 1.
[0:27] kind of a
[0:29] you'll see odd opening scripture but
[0:34] that's the way I felt to go this morning
[0:36] so
[0:37] we'll speak on worship from Love
[0:40] but let all that I am praise the Lord
[0:43] with my whole heart I will praise His
[0:45] holy name
[0:46] and let all that I am praise the Lord
[0:48] amen may I never forget the good things
[0:51] he does for me because he forgives all
[0:53] my sins and heals all my diseases and
[0:56] redeems me from death and crowns me with
[0:57] love and Tender Mercies may God add a
[1:00] blessings you can have your seats
[1:04] over in Luke chapter four you don't have
[1:06] to turn if they they get it they may get
[1:08] it up here chapter 4 verse 8. when Jesus
[1:11] answered and said to him get thee behind
[1:13] me Satan for it is written Thou shalt
[1:16] Worship the Lord thy God and him only
[1:18] shalt thou serve
[1:21] you know it's tempting for every person
[1:23] to worship someone or something
[1:26] we worship our money
[1:28] we might worship our Recreation work our
[1:30] worship our homes our
[1:32] some people worship their wives some
[1:35] worship their husbands because you're
[1:37] going to worship something
[1:39] you know but one thing you know the Lord
[1:40] does not accept our
[1:42] insincere worship
[1:44] you know if if we come to church because
[1:46] our mom and dad makes us and we raise
[1:48] our hands just to please them
[1:50] that's not even acceptable to God he
[1:52] don't even like that
[1:54] you might as well not even come to
[1:55] church if that's the case but God
[1:58] demands
[2:00] his worst all the worship be directed to
[2:02] him
[2:04] and nothing else
[2:05] you know when we come to this building
[2:07] we ought to be able to
[2:09] worship one thing
[2:11] one person and that's almighty God we're
[2:14] not here to worship the preacher the
[2:16] pastor the song leader
[2:19] all them all them are good men but we're
[2:21] not here to worship man we're here to
[2:22] worship one thing and ask God in John
[2:24] chapter 4 verse 19.
[2:27] very familiar you're the woman at the
[2:28] well the woman said to him sir I foresee
[2:31] that thou art a prophet
[2:32] she said our fathers worshiped in this
[2:34] mountain and ye say that in Jerusalem is
[2:37] a place where men ought to worship
[2:39] and Jesus said to her woman
[2:42] believe me he had no good authority
[2:45] he knew what he was talking about he
[2:47] said woman believe me the hour is coming
[2:51] when ye shall neither in this mountain
[2:53] nor yet in Jerusalem worship the father
[2:58] because the one we worship will be on
[3:01] the inside
[3:02] he's a you worship ye no not what
[3:06] he said you don't know who you're
[3:07] worshiping you don't know what you're
[3:08] worshiping
[3:10] he says but we know who we worship
[3:13] he could speak because he was the god he
[3:16] knew the Jews were worship the right
[3:17] woman because he was the one
[3:19] you got to know who you're worshiping
[3:20] today
[3:24] but the hour cometh and now is when the
[3:27] true worshipers shall worship the father
[3:29] in spirit
[3:31] and in truth for the father seeketh such
[3:34] to worship Him
[3:36] but God is a spirit and they that
[3:39] worship Him must worship Him in spirit
[3:40] and in truth
[3:43] you know he just got through town of her
[3:44] so you worship you know not what
[3:48] we know what we worship
[3:50] I hope we know what we worship this
[3:51] morning
[3:53] or who we worship I'm going to raise it
[3:55] do you know who it is
[3:57] do you have the right object of worship
[4:00] but in order for us to worship you got
[4:02] to know what worship means
[4:05] worship the word worship is derived from
[4:07] an Old English word
[4:09] which I can't
[4:10] pronounce
[4:11] I'm just going to say from an Old
[4:13] English word meaning honor shown to an
[4:15] object
[4:16] it is the simplest simplest definition
[4:19] worship is to give Worth to something
[4:23] so whatever you worship it's worth
[4:26] something to you
[4:28] a dictionary definition of worship is
[4:30] reverent honor and homage paid to God
[4:35] or a person
[4:37] or to any object regarded as sacred
[4:40] worship is honor paid to a superior
[4:43] being
[4:44] it means to give homage honor reverence
[4:47] respect adoration praise glory to a
[4:50] superior being
[4:52] there's a superior being in the building
[4:54] this morning and that's who we're
[4:55] worshiping first chronicles 16 29 says
[4:59] give to the Lord
[5:01] the glory do his name bring an offering
[5:05] and come unto him
[5:07] o Worship the Lord in the beauty of
[5:10] holiness
[5:12] Romans 1 20.
[5:14] for since the creation of this world
[5:17] his attributes his invisible attributes
[5:20] are clearly seen been understood by the
[5:22] things that are made even his eternal
[5:25] power and godhead so that they without
[5:28] excuse
[5:30] because although they knew God they did
[5:32] not glorify him has God nor were
[5:35] thankful but become futile in their
[5:37] thoughts
[5:39] well and they're foolishness of Hearts
[5:42] were darkened and they exchanged the
[5:45] truth of God
[5:46] for a lie and worshiped and serve the
[5:49] Creator create the creature more than
[5:52] the Creator
[5:53] that reminds me of the story of
[5:54] Nebuchadnezzar
[5:57] when Daniel comes to him and tells us
[5:59] all his visions and all things he was
[6:02] dreaming he thought Daniel was a god
[6:05] so instead of worshiping the Creator he
[6:08] worshiped the creature
[6:10] the creation
[6:11] and I'm afraid that's what a lot of us
[6:13] has done this message
[6:15] they sit and tell you get the preachers
[6:17] off the platform brother Branham is
[6:18] their Prophet push play and Obey I'm
[6:21] afraid people is worshiping the creation
[6:24] more than the Creator
[6:27] I like this statement right here
[6:30] I found it somebody said the gods we
[6:33] worship write their names on our faces
[6:38] it's wrote on your face
[6:41] you know the saying is and my wife tells
[6:43] me I'm this way
[6:44] that it's written all over your face I
[6:47] can't hide something goes wrong you can
[6:50] tell by my face something ain't right so
[6:52] I can't hide it
[6:54] so whatever you're servant is written
[6:56] all over your face
[7:00] we could go to a sermon that for a
[7:02] little while brother Matt can do that
[7:03] next time he preaches
[7:06] if you're wearing makeup
[7:09] it's wrote all over your face
[7:12] I can get with you for a few minutes you
[7:14] and you tell me your passion I've seen
[7:17] people come up and say oh man I've done
[7:20] this I've this basketball game I did I I
[7:22] I've got so many points it's all over
[7:25] their face it's written all over their
[7:27] face
[7:28] their God is written all over their face
[7:31] so whatever you talk about get you
[7:33] excited I don't care what it is I mean
[7:35] you could be shopping
[7:36] getting all excited it's written all
[7:39] over your face I can see it
[7:42] but also I love it when I'm talking to a
[7:44] person and they're talking about God and
[7:46] you can see it all over their face their
[7:49] God is written all over their face
[7:53] Hallelujah you're telling me something
[7:55] you're getting excited I know who you're
[7:56] serving
[7:57] I know who's God you're worshiping
[8:00] oh
[8:02] man you could just tell it the gods we
[8:04] worship wrote their names on our face
[8:08] you're gonna have something written on
[8:09] your face it's gonna be the mark of the
[8:11] beast or the Seal of God
[8:14] we won't get into that we know what
[8:15] happens all in that part but a man will
[8:18] worship something
[8:19] have no doubt
[8:21] about that he may think that his tribute
[8:24] is paid in secret in the dark recess of
[8:26] his heart but it will be out
[8:30] that which dominates
[8:33] will determine his life and character
[8:36] therefore he behooves us to be careful
[8:37] what we worship
[8:41] what we are worse been
[8:44] so what you are worshiping you become
[8:50] so if you Worship in Jesus Christ this
[8:52] morning watch you be coming
[8:53] you're becoming to live and walk and
[8:56] talk in Jesus Christ
[8:58] I want it wrote all over my face
[9:01] we do what we worship
[9:04] and we worship What We Love and Desire
[9:07] my goodness
[9:09] in scripture the word for love is agape
[9:12] which means totally giving oneself over
[9:15] to something
[9:17] to surrender all to it to be fully
[9:20] committed to the God we worship
[9:24] are we fully committed
[9:28] if it's game plan are you committed to
[9:30] it you're worse than something
[9:36] glory to God we may not bow down to
[9:38] idols
[9:39] you're not going down here and bow down
[9:40] oh we worship you we worship you TV
[9:43] monitor we're worshiping you Golf Club
[9:45] we're worshiping you uh Ross's
[9:51] hate that store
[9:56] worship stems from the heart
[9:59] we worship what we love
[10:03] We crave what we love
[10:06] we fill our lives with what we love
[10:09] and we submit ourselves to what we love
[10:11] and we are controlled by it
[10:14] are you controlled by your love
[10:17] just think about it
[10:19] what are you in love with this morning
[10:22] Mercy
[10:25] skip a little bit
[10:28] so we worship what we love what you love
[10:31] second Timothy 4 8 said hence for there
[10:33] is laid up for me a crown of
[10:34] righteousness which the Lord the
[10:35] righteous judge shall give me at that
[10:37] day
[10:38] not to me only but unto all of them
[10:41] also that love his appearing
[10:45] there's two kinds of love
[10:47] we got Ophelia love and agape love
[10:50] affiliate love is what we have one for
[10:51] the other
[10:52] husband and wife
[10:54] but there's only one that's that agape
[10:55] love is meant for God
[10:58] we can't love God just by our own human
[11:00] love
[11:02] we got to have his his love if you love
[11:05] his appearing he's coming after you
[11:09] that's the love it will go into rapture
[11:12] you know we heard the story of the woman
[11:13] that washed Jesus's feet
[11:16] Luke 7 36.
[11:18] and one of the Pharisees desired him
[11:20] that he would eat with them
[11:22] and he went into the Pharisees house and
[11:24] sat down at meat and behold a woman of
[11:26] the city
[11:27] which was a sinner when she knew that
[11:29] Jesus said at meat in the Pharisees
[11:31] house
[11:32] brought an alabaster box of ointment
[11:35] and stood At His Feet behind him weeping
[11:39] and begin to wash his feet with her
[11:40] tears and did wipe them with the hairs
[11:43] of her head
[11:45] and kissed his feet and nor them with
[11:47] ointment
[11:48] Jesus got invited to a party
[11:54] the big preacher that they want to be
[11:55] popular
[11:56] I have Jesus in my house
[12:00] I'll tell you when you invite Jesus he's
[12:01] going to come
[12:04] priest Jesus will keep his appointments
[12:06] it's not like us we have an appointment
[12:08] set for tomorrow at 2.
[12:10] will cause it I can't make it
[12:12] something's come up it don't matter God
[12:15] ain't gonna say hey
[12:17] I like so-and-so better I do you
[12:20] I'm gonna have to cancel my appointment
[12:21] with you this evening
[12:23] God's not like that you invite God in
[12:25] the building
[12:26] God's here
[12:29] he's going to keep it
[12:34] I'm trying not to go too fast I don't
[12:35] want to start preaching
[12:39] When God says he will be there he will
[12:41] be there
[12:43] it's like when brother Luther or
[12:44] somebody comes up for prayer
[12:46] we invite your presence to come to this
[12:48] church this morning
[12:50] be sure he's coming but what are we
[12:52] going to do with him
[12:55] when Jesus come to this party
[12:59] there was nobody there to wash his feet
[13:00] because that's what they did when he got
[13:01] coming off the street they had a foot
[13:02] wash flunky there to wash his feet clean
[13:05] his feet give him some new sandals clean
[13:07] shoes
[13:08] he'll go through the next door and
[13:10] they'll anoint him with oil his hands
[13:12] and his feet and he'll walk it on her
[13:14] face it's refreshing
[13:16] there was nobody to do that to him
[13:18] the host was there to greet him they
[13:20] usually greet him on the shoulder and
[13:21] and welcome into the you're part of the
[13:23] family
[13:24] but nobody done Jesus like that that day
[13:28] so they started eating having a good old
[13:30] time
[13:31] the lamb must have smelled good as Brett
[13:33] Brown would say the scent probably went
[13:35] out to the neighborhood
[13:36] this guy wanted his party known that he
[13:38] had it in his front yard
[13:40] where the people will go by the street
[13:41] and see there's Jesus hey what's he
[13:44] doing in there
[13:46] say this woman the Bible said was a
[13:47] great sinner
[13:49] and she came and she came what's going
[13:52] on up there it's a big party
[13:54] and she's seen this man sitting in a
[13:56] corner
[13:57] laying on the couch dirty
[14:01] and such a love went out of her
[14:06] she was a prostitute but it was the kind
[14:08] of love we were talking about
[14:09] I love so much love that she went and
[14:11] got everything she owned took all of her
[14:14] money and went bought this expensive oil
[14:17] that she was going to go in and wash his
[14:19] feet
[14:22] Hallelujah she's going to give the best
[14:24] she's got
[14:25] that's what we need to be this morning
[14:27] we need to come here and give God the
[14:29] best that we got
[14:32] Burrell said right down through that
[14:33] crowd of Pharisees she went on her way
[14:35] elbow on her way to Jesus
[14:37] God help us tonight
[14:39] I elbow our way through all this stuff
[14:43] what did you elbow your way through to
[14:45] come in here this morning
[14:46] she went right on through pushing
[14:48] through the Pharisees
[14:49] and she got right to where he was and
[14:51] she broke the alabaster box and poured
[14:53] it on him she fell down on the floor of
[14:55] his feet and began to weep
[14:57] and she was patting his feet
[14:59] she got kind of beside herself
[15:02] you imagine all the tears that come out
[15:04] of that woman's eyes
[15:06] just to
[15:07] wash his feet that's a lot of water
[15:10] because he had a lot of dirt on his feet
[15:14] she was at the only place that she could
[15:17] get her help
[15:19] no wonder she was so hysterical
[15:21] no wonder she was beside herself God
[15:24] help us get beside ourselves long enough
[15:29] to get saved anyhow
[15:32] I believe Jesus felt just a little more
[15:34] comfortable
[15:36] a sinner at his feet makes Jesus feel
[15:39] comfortable
[15:42] what audit might do for the bride
[15:45] how comfortable will he feel this
[15:46] morning
[15:47] did we go bring him in here and put him
[15:49] over here in a corner somewhere
[15:51] you sit right here Jesus
[15:54] there he was her washing his feet and
[15:57] she was kissing his feet
[15:59] and she got so beside herself
[16:03] she had all of her hair done up like you
[16:05] know she was washed his feet that kissed
[16:07] him and her hair would fall down and she
[16:10] would took her hair and begin to wipe
[16:12] his feet to kiss them wiping his feet
[16:14] and her hair fell down
[16:21] laughs
[16:22] some of this is Harry long enough to
[16:24] even dry his feet
[16:27] wow
[16:29] I hated that he didn't say it
[16:34] At His Feet behind him
[16:37] and began to wash his feet with her
[16:39] tears
[16:41] and it wiped him with the hairs of her
[16:43] head
[16:48] she started kissing on his feet
[16:51] then she Anointed with ointment
[16:55] and now when the Pharisee which had
[16:57] bitten him saw it he spake within
[16:59] himself saying this man if he were a
[17:02] prophet would have known who in what
[17:04] manner of man this is that toucheth him
[17:07] for she is a sinner
[17:09] and Jesus answered said to him Simon
[17:12] I have somewhat to say to thee
[17:14] and he says Master say on
[17:18] there was a certain creditor who had two
[17:20] debtors that one owed 500 Pence the
[17:22] other 50. and when they had nothing to
[17:25] pay he frankly forgave them both
[17:28] tell me therefore which of them would
[17:30] love him the most
[17:33] he answered right Simon answered said I
[17:35] suppose that he to whom he forgave the
[17:37] most
[17:38] and he said unto him thou has rightly
[17:40] judged that he turned to the woman
[17:43] looking at the woman he said unto Simon
[17:47] seeth thou this woman
[17:49] I entered into that house God gave us me
[17:52] no water for my feet
[17:54] but she has washed my feet with her
[17:55] tears
[17:56] and wiped in with the hairs of her head
[18:00] thou gave us me no kiss but this woman
[18:03] since the time I came in hath not ceased
[18:05] to kiss my feet
[18:08] in the worst center of the city
[18:11] Simon I had something to say to thee Dr
[18:13] Simon you invited me down here when I
[18:15] come because you invited me you never
[18:18] gave me anywhere to wash my feet you
[18:20] never anointed my face and hands you
[18:22] never kiss me Simon
[18:24] you didn't love me Simon
[18:27] if you had loved me you would wash my
[18:30] feet
[18:33] if you had loved me you would anointed
[18:35] me
[18:36] if you had anointed me love me you would
[18:39] have kissed me but you never made me
[18:41] welcome
[18:42] oh God we want to make you welcome this
[18:44] morning
[18:47] he said my head with the oil without
[18:48] this not anointed but this woman half
[18:50] anointed my feet with an ointment
[18:52] wherefore I say unto her
[18:54] her sins which are many
[18:58] are forgiven
[19:00] for she loved much
[19:04] but to whom little Is Forgiven the same
[19:06] loveth little
[19:09] for she loved much or therefore she
[19:11] loved much her great love was not the
[19:13] cause of her remission of sins
[19:16] but for the full and free remission of
[19:19] many sins which had been manifest in her
[19:21] was the cause of her great love and her
[19:23] showing it in the manners she had done
[19:27] this poor woman had been a great sinner
[19:31] and her many sins were pardoned
[19:33] and therefore she expressed much love to
[19:36] him from whom she had received her
[19:38] pardon by above actions
[19:40] much more than Simon had done
[19:45] but to whom little Is Forgiven the same
[19:48] loveth little
[19:50] my
[19:51] Jesus just turns to look at her says thy
[19:53] sins are forgiven
[19:56] and they that said it meet with him
[19:58] begin to say within themselves who is
[20:00] this
[20:02] that forgiveth sins also
[20:06] he just looked at the woman says thy
[20:07] faith has saved thee just go in peace
[20:10] that's what God is wanting
[20:13] a love for him like this woman she had
[20:15] such love that she wasn't going to see
[20:17] Jesus left that way
[20:20] do we have that love for him
[20:22] that we say Jesus come on in the
[20:24] building
[20:25] come on in
[20:27] or do we say this is my seat
[20:30] I've been sitting this seat for years
[20:34] so Jesus there's one over in the corner
[20:36] it's been empty for a while go sit in it
[20:39] or we go or will we say here Jesus
[20:42] take my seat
[20:44] we'll see Jesus come sit beside me
[20:48] move over for him
[20:50] is that what you want to do
[20:53] we're not going to lead Jesus off in the
[20:55] corner somewhere
[20:56] with dirty feet
[20:58] there should be such a love
[21:01] emanating out of us
[21:05] they should be such a love that we can't
[21:08] leave him that way
[21:10] we got to water Him worship Him with our
[21:13] praise that's what we're going to do
[21:14] this morning
[21:16] when brother Tony comes out here he's
[21:18] going to start Us in worship
[21:20] who we're worshiping we're not
[21:22] worshiping brother Tony standing up here
[21:25] or any of these brother brothers that
[21:26] leads us singing We're Not worshiping
[21:28] them
[21:30] they're leading Us in worship
[21:32] but we're only worshiping one thing one
[21:35] being that's Supernatural
[21:41] God is just waiting to see what you'll
[21:43] do
[21:45] he wants to drop his presence down on
[21:47] you
[21:49] he wants to start a celebration in the
[21:51] building here
[21:52] are we willing to come to this party
[21:56] it's not a popular party
[21:59] we don't have drinking in here
[22:01] like you suppose
[22:06] trying I'm trying to be good
[22:09] let's don't leave him in the corner with
[22:11] dirty feet
[22:12] because if you love him
[22:14] you won't do it
[22:17] he loved you
[22:19] so much that he came down from Glory
[22:24] left that where he was worshiped day and
[22:28] night
[22:30] left his crown on on the throne there
[22:32] and come down to pick up a stinking
[22:34] human flesh
[22:36] for us
[22:38] that's love
[22:40] that's love
[22:41] that's what we need to do we come in
[22:43] here
[22:44] we need a sacrifice we need to lay all
[22:46] that stuff aside
[22:48] we can't love him our human love just
