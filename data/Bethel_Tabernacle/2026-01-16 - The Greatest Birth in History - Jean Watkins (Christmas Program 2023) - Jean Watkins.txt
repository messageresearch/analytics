TRANSCRIPT
========================================
babies. There is uh Judith, Anna, Samuel, uh Hazel, Lana, and little Zoe. &gt;&gt; Babies are precious. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All babies are precious. But let me tell you the story about the most precious baby &gt;&gt; that's ever been born. In the city of Nazareth in Galilee, there lived a young godly girl, a virgin. Her name was Mary. She was engaged to a godly man named Joseph. And one day as she was going about her house duties, maybe praying, an angel came into her. Hell, thou are highly favored among women. The Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou among women. It scared her. Wouldn't it scare you? &gt;&gt; I mean, if an angel come in, wouldn't it scare you? It scared him. What is going on? Fear not, Mary. I've come to tell you, you're favored of God. You shall conceive in your womb and bear a child, a son, and you shall call his name Jesus. How can this be? I I I'm not married. I've never known a man. The Holy Ghost will come upon you and the power of the highest shall shine upon you &gt;&gt; and that holy thing that's born of you shall be called the son of God. And Mary, your cousin Elizabeth, she's old. She's barren. She's going to have a child, too. Cuz with God, nothing is impossible. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And Mary said, "Get unto me according unto thy word." And the angel left. And Mary quickly went to see her cousin Elizabeth. While she was gone, I can see Joseph. He's engaged to the most wonderful girl in the world. He thinks, you know, and he thinks I'm a carpenter. I'm going to fix our house up just like I know she will love it. I can't wait for her to get back. I'm so excited to marry this wonderful girl. I can't believe God has so blessed me to find a girl like Mary. And it's time for her to come back. She's been gone three months and here she's coming. He's running out to greet her and he Something's wrong. Something's wrong. Mary, you're expecting a baby and it's not my baby. I I something's wrong. here. Besides, Joseph, an angel come to me and told me that I was the virgin that was going to fulfill this the prophecy that a virgin shall conceive and bring Emanuel, the Christ child, and I'm that virgin. Mary, that prophecy is hundreds of years old. No one thinks about that prophecy anymore. But it's true, Joseph. It's true. The angel Gabriel come and told me that. And I'm expecting a baby. Mary, I I I can't get my I can't get my mind around this. I got to think. There went a way to think. Brokenhearted. When y'all be brokenhearted? &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah. &gt;&gt; The wife, the beautiful virgin girl you going to marry, she's expecting a baby. It's not your baby. I'll put her away. I have to put her away, but I'll do it in secret because we live in Nazareth and it doesn't have the best reputation of being good to people. They'll make her life. They'll probably stone her to death. I can't let that happen. I I will put her away. I'm going to do it in secret. He fell asleep. Very troubled in his mind. Heartbroken. Yeah. &gt;&gt; I mean, all his dreams gone. And an angel come to him. Joseph, thou son of David, don't fear to take unto thee Mary thy wife. That she told you the truth. That which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost, and she shall bear a son, and you shall call his name Jesus, for he shall save his people from their sins. And so, Joseph, rise right now and go marry your wife. And he did. But they didn't live together as husband and wife till after Jesus is born. Mary had to be a virgin. &gt;&gt; Yeah, &gt;&gt; I can see him. He's fixed up this beautiful little house. And it's their little honeymoon house. And day after day, she's getting larger and larger with child. And and I can see maybe in the afternoon when all the day is done, we're sitting down enjoying each other's company. And I can see Mary one day said, "Joseph, I I'm puzzled about something. I I'm I can't get it off my mind, Joseph. I I wonder how this can be." The prophet said the Messiah, the Emanuel, would be born in Bethlehem of Judea. Joseph, we don't live in Bethlehem. We live in Nazareth. How's that going to happen? I don't know. I wondered it myself. All I know is that the prophets said it that he'd be born in Bethlehem of Judea. We believe the prophets. Nothing is impossible with God. I don't see how it's going to happen. That's what the prophets prophesied. I know, Joseph. I believe it, too. And as time went on, they're learning to live with one another, newlywed, you know, and she's getting larger and larger with child. And all of one day, here come a notice, a decree from the government. Everybody's got to go to the home of their birth, register, and pay taxes. Nobody's excluded. Don't matter your condition. You can be laying dying. You still got to go. How in the world, Joseph, are we going to go? I'm almost ready to be delivered. How we I don't know, Mary, but we got to go because you and I both were born in Bethlehem and I'm in the lineage of the house of David, Bethlehem. We got to go. So, they set out. A lot of other people had to go, too. Very hard trip. 90 miles by foot. took most people four or five days if they walked eight or nine hours a day uh to get there. Well, you can imagine it probably took them twice as long to get there. Now they're going through mountains and valleys and deserts and robbers and wild animals, bad weather. And so I can just see them taking their little donkey and packing up some water and some food and some essentials they have to have on on the way. and they set out for Bethlehem. A lot of other people did too. And of course, Mary and Joseph was left behind cuz there's no way I mean, how far can a 8, nine month expecting a baby girl, how far can she walk in a day? So, they finally come to Little Bethlehem. The place was packed. I mean, packed. People were camping out in the fields. There was it was just people everywhere. See, they they had to come pay taxes, but also the Passover was coming up and 2 million people according to historians say, would come there during Passover. 2 million people. That's a lot. And so when they got to Bethlehem, well then now there's a little in down here. And if they see your situation, Mary, I'm sure they'll find a place. There's no way you can camp out in the field in your situation. And so they went to the end and let's say he was a kind inkeeper. There's nowhere. There's people all over the place. It was impossible for him to fit one more person in. But he could see her situation. Listen. Down over the hill here, there's a stable in a cave. Nobody's in it, just a few animals. And if you'll hurry, go on down there and find that stable in the cave. Obviously they found the cave, the stable in the cave And so I I can see as as Joseph and Mary are going down to find the stable in the cave, they found it. And when they when they went in, it gave them shelter. They didn't have to camp out in the fields. And so when they got in there, I can Mary's beyond walking. She's walk. There's no way she can walk. She's riding the little donkey. And I can see Joseph tenderly taking her off the donkey, setting her down, giving her a drink of water, maybe a little something to eat. I can see him taking the little donkey and taking care of it's tired, too. They're exhausted. And then I can see him taking the straw in the stable in the cave and spreading it out ever so gently, no lumps in it, best he could to lay Mary's poor tired body down. &gt;&gt; And before the night is over, &gt;&gt; baby Jesus is born. And Joseph found swaddling cloth. It's strips of cloth tied together and he wrapped baby Jesus in the swaddling cloth laid him in the manger was a feeding trough. In other word is a manger. About that time on the hill about a mile outside of Bethlehem were shepherds watching over their sheep by night and day. These weren't just ordinary shepherds. These were special shepherds. Some say Levitical shepherds. And they were there because in Bethlehem was the only place in Israel that raised the pascal lambs, the Passover lambs, the sacrificial lambs. Josephus says in Passover they sacrificed 250,000 little baby Pascal lambs, special lambs, special shepherds. When the shepherds saw the mother U was fixing to have a baby, the first thing they done was took her to a stable in a cave. And when the baby was born, the first, if it was a little boy, had to be a little boy, they wrapped him in swaddling cloth and laid him in the manger because they had to inspect him. Is he got any broken bones? Is he got any blemishes? Is he got any imperfections? He can't be a pascal lamb if he does. And if he qualified a royal birth, then he was put out with the other Pascal lambs. And all of a sudden that night, an angel appeared and the glory of God shone all around them. And what terrified him? It scared them to death. I mean, that's our terminology. Scared them to death, but it terrified him. And he said, "Fear not. I bring you good tidings of great joy. For unto you this day in the city of David is born Christ the Lord. And you shall find the babe. This will be a shine sign to you. You shall find the babe wrapped in swaddling cloth laying in a manger. The lamb of God. And all of a sudden, the whole sky was heavenly host singing and peace on earth, goodwill towards men. These shepherds were so excited they couldn't. They were beside theelves. They were speechless. We We must go see this. We must go see what the angel said. And And they took off to the stable in the cave. And there he was wrapped in swaddling cloth, laying in a manger. baby Jesus. They went everywhere. Now, this place is packed out with people. They went everywhere telling an angel, "You can't believe it. An angel said this and we went down there and sure enough, he was there." And the people wondered, "What is going on?" They wondered, "Well, of course, they're special shepherds. They got to get back to their special sheep. The Passover's coming up and they got to have these little sheep ready without a blemish, without a broken bone or anything. They're special little sheep, little boy loun. And anyway, at the same time, about the same time that night, there were three wise men way away in the east. And they were there for one purpose, to study the stars, the heavens. We all know that the stars was God's first Bible. And anything that happens in the heavens happens on earth. They knew that. And they were there for the purpose. Like you go to college, like Uriah's going to college, Gideon. It was that was to study the stars, see what's going to happen on Earth. And while they're studying, strange things are begin to happen in the sky. And they notice, did you see that? There's something fixing to happen on earth. Something great, a king is going to be born. And about that time, a new star appeared like they had never saw before. There it is. It's a king. It's the king of the Jews. It's the King of Kings. We're Jews. He's our king. We must go find We must follow this star and we must find this great king. So they packed up whatever they had to pack and and they set out following the star night after night, week after week, month after month through rivers, creeks, deserts, mountains, wild animals, robbers, bad weather, but they kept following that star. They're going to follow till they find that king. And they followed and followed. And finally, they come to Jerusalem. And when they got to Jerusalem, the star left. This is it. This is where he's at. They run around everywhere. Where is he? Where is where is who? The king of the Jews. We saw his star in the east. and we've come to worship him. Where is he? Troubled all Jerusalem. Word got back to King Herod and he was a wicked evil king. Troubled him. He called in all the scribes, all the priests and demanded of them, I want to know where this so-called king, your prophets say he's to be born. Bethlehem of Judea. So then he calls secretly calls him the three wise men and diligently asks them uh when did you say the star first come out? Uh when did you start following this star? Two years two years ago. Took you two years to get here. Well the prophets say he's to be born in Bethlehem of Judea. That's only about six miles down the road here. Just go on down there and when you find him, bring word to me. He's a king. I'm a king. I want to go and worship him, too. So, bring word back to me when you find the young child. They left there just so excited. They were might have been some Pentecostal people shouting and never know, but they were thrilled. And they took off all in that star to Bethlehem and it stopped over a house. Their journey was over. They rejoiced. We finally hear after two hard years. He's here. And when they went into the house, there was the young child Jesus and his mother Mary. And they fell down and they worshiped him. And they gave him their gifts. Gold, frankincense, marrow. That is the most precious baby that's ever been born on this earth. Our savior Emmanuel, God with us, the Lord Jesus Christ. Thank y'all. A bless.
