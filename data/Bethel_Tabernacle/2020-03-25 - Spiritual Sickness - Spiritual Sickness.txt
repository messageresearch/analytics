certainly dealt with my heart on this thought want to invite you to Genesis chapter 2 this evening amen and just welcome our larger audience across the airwaves god bless you tonight amen we have an assembly of brothers and a sister here with us tonight to worship the Lord in spirit and in truth and to hear the word of God so I am happy to be here indeed a man we want to look in Genesis chapter 2 and want to speak to you tonight about spiritual sickness spiritual sickness amen Genesis chapter 2 we just have one single verse to read and we'll let you be seated verse 7 and the Lord God formed man of the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life and man became a living soul let's pray father I stand here tonight Lord with them what I would at least consider Lord to be a very technical teaching service tonight Lord and I'm under some bit of anxiety to make sure that I have it all in order Lord and perfectly aligned and I've spent the entire day now my mind saturated with it I've been studying it Lord for more than a week now and so here it is I probably myself would have never scheduled to preach this on a Wednesday but I don't get to choose that so it's up to you you had it for tonight so Lord I'm just been all day now and I'm counting on you now father as I have talked it over with you at length Lord that I'm just trusting in you tonight to teach us the things that you want us to know I commit it to you commit the whole streaming audience Lord let the stream work good father there's a lot of people depending on it tonight on our website streaming on Facebook streaming some perhaps YouTube streaming Lord we just want all of it to work good I pray that you will bless the instruments and bless the signal and be with the brothers if there'd be a technical difficulty you'd dis whisper the answer to them right quick we commit it to you Lord and we are looking to you now in these in these strange and unsettling times for the world so be with us now and teach us what you need us to know in Jesus name Amen God bless your friends you can be seated now I want to say mainly to the streaming audience before you step off let me make this announcement as you all know the governor issued a directive authorizing law enforcement to break up any groups greater than three people so we are ten here tonight and brother Matt contacted the Buford County Sheriff's Department they said he talked to a sergeant they do not have any understanding from sheriff Tanner what his plans are as far as enforcement of that we're hoping that we won't be interrupted if you see me suddenly stop and suddenly I'm in a conversation with someone at the back you'll understand that they've come in and if that happens then we'll go to dismiss everybody except myself and brother mark we will stay here I will keep on preaching brother mark we'll keep broadcasting and then that would put us in compliance so we should be able to finish but if there's a disturbance just please give us a minute to get it arranged and then we'll carry on god bless you brothers Thank You Amen god bless amen praise the Lord just want to be aware so that people don't panic a man spoke to brother Kevin he wasn't aware that there was any plans for enforcement so at least on churches meeting in small groups we are following the federal guideline from President and the CDC so hopefully that would be enough given that it's a church and we are keeping our distance apart I believe that we ought to obey Caesars desires so long as it doesn't conflict with the Word of God now I want to speak tonight on spiritual sickness and it's interesting because speaking to a very good friend of mine and minister and you know him well he's a good friend of us here and we were just talking about how that this you know this kovat 19 this coronavirus that seems to have the world at its knees you know it's in and and I was just watching today brother Tony was interviewing some folks over in Israel and they're just as bewildered by it everybody seems to can't figure out you know the level of fear but yet at the same time there's there's there's ominous possibilities so I guess it's just what the scripture says you know men's hearts failing for fear and I've said for years there is no greater fear than the fear of the unknown its intrinsic in a man to to fear and have anxiety when something is coming and he knows it's coming but he's not sure what its gonna look like or how it's gonna happen then that causes a lot of anxiety but lift up your heads Jesus said Amen this is not a time for the bride to be in fear I sent out a little greeting to the church today I trust you received it if you didn't you'll find it in the Bethel Tabernacle whatsapp chat just a little update from from me to you plan to keep that going periodically we're at tonight as one week we met last Wednesday for our first reduced congregation service like this and so now tonight is one week exactly and I think we still have some more days to go if the 15 days is up what day does that hit on hey April 1 maybe or I think maybe similar the last day of March something like that so we'll we'll see what's going on at that time all we can really say is you know it's what the president keeps saying we'll see that's all we know we'll see what happens and I'm sure that they are they've certainly demonstrated that they're making cautious decisions and we're trying to do the same thing now let me get right into the service here because it's a Wednesday and I have a little bit of limited limitation on my time some time ago I was trying to look at the date and it was quite a few years ago actually I took a sermon and used this scripture in Genesis chapter 2 verse 7 the Lord God formed man of the dust of the ground breathed tuned into his nostrils the breath of life and he became a living soul and some some translations say a living being so man became a living being or a living soul and we find out that in the in the Hebrew I did a Hebrew study word word study and you know and took some commentary from Jewish rabbis and what more and I have them here quoted there is a certain rabbi Sherman spelt with a funny way that Jews would spell Sherman not like we would spell it but we find out that that God being a living being God fashioned from the dust the body and we know it's brother Branham taught us that the body of Adam stood there lifeless with his toes like roots going down into the ground where God grew him up like you'd grow a tree and then God breathed into him the breath of life and he became a living soul and so man then manifested as nephesh in the Hebrew word and we find out that that that in the that in the Mishnah which is an oral an oral tradition that they pass along that the rabbi's take this word and they use a synonym a perfect synonym of this word and it is in the Hebrew ma vay if I'm pronouncing that right and it's derived from the root bah-bah-bah and the verb means and it's an important verb it means to ask to seek or to request as in prayer and so when you when you take this root word to the Hebrew term that he became a living being and then you take the root of that that the rabbis used that means to ask to seek or to request as in prayer and rabbi Sherman comments in other words the Talmud defines when it says a living being or a living soul the Talmud defines that man as the creature that prays because if you think about it he's the only one that does God created all the animals and man is a mammal he's a human animal and he's the top of the animal world and he was made different than all the other animals below him in that he was made in the image now more the serpent was not exactly in the image of God though he wasn't upright beasts and he was more subtle than any beast of the field but he did not have a soul so he could not reason it was not like Lucifer is not like an angel not like God not like a man because a man is a triune being whereas all other animals are of dual nature they're not true they are not a triune being they are body and spirit they have a spirit of life and their spirit is what animates or powers your flesh if your spirit leaves your body your body lays down in and it doesn't talk it doesn't react it doesn't respond there's no life inside the body anymore all right so then we realized then that that this man that that God turned the earth into a creature that preys and so that then then you have to conclude in fact as you couldn't fail to conclude that God built man uh as a as a being of reciprocal fellowship that God built man on purpose so that that man could pray and in fact his praying is literally in his DNA that the very Ebru synonym of the fact that god made him a living soul meant that he's a creature that prays and in fact his one scholar called man praying dirt all right this is why that that the dictionary of Bible imagery defines Adam now there's there's Adam azzam as a proper name that was given to the first man that God made a living soul but remember that Adam existed before he was a living soul put in human flesh mate from the dust of the earth and so it defines Adam then when he's when he's incarnated in flesh and given a a the breath of life that Adam then is the fleshly distillation now brother branham would not use the word distill brother branham would use the word condescend see so so it's it's brother branham is meaning in the same sense that that that man this man that is now standing there is the fleshly distillation of the creative and divine word stamped says the dictionary of biblical imagery stamped with the divine image all right now this was a perfect situation this man was an amateur god he named the animals he commanded the wind he commanded nature God brother branham says God did not even make the earth for himself to rule he made man to rule God rules the universe and so we find then that the earth in its in its most probable purpose then is the genesis are the beginning of God extorting to express himself in a family and so he he he doesn't want to express himself in something different than he is or something different than what he hasn't envisioned for himself to be when he expresses God's eventually gonna express himself in flesh and so he's going to express his children to look just like him to act just like him to be built just like him oh my we're gonna go somewhere tonight so I hope you really stay close attention all right now what caused the fall now we would say well you know as the story goes Lucifer you know desiring to have a kingdom like Michael who wanted to build his kingdom and be worshipped like God he starts out he realizes he can't create he doesn't have that power he had every power he wasn't a 90-pound weakling Lucifer had every power that Michael had except one he couldn't create and this made him jealous he was envious of that so he's going to create his family vicariously through a medium through an instrument you understand and he's going to he's going to use the serpent because the serpent is built unique for God's purpose the serpent looks like a man is upright like a man but he can't reason he's more subtle than any beast of the field but he can't reason the Word of God because he doesn't have a soul but he uniquely apart from all other animals has a place for one but the place is empty you have a place for a soul and it's filled with Europe so you understand and that that area is in the is in the heart brother branham said they even even biology they have found that there's a little place in the heart that the for years they didn't know what its purpose was and they think now it's where you know life ik life starts in a human being and so brother Branham says even God makes science prove his word because the Bible says as a man thinketh in his heart man so so now we realized then that Satan is going to he's going to if I could put it this way Satan is going to infect the spirit of the serpent he's going to come like a virus would and I'm going to show you an illustration animation three animations right quick that will help you get your mind around the natural typing the spiritual because brother amps are they running perfect continuity that natural always type spiritual now never the other way because the spirit is the real it's the original what what this is this I know this seems solid and this seems solid and this seems solid this is all just shadow there is a real brother Brendan said you see a tree struggling out here to live it proves there's one somewhere that doesn't struggle you see a no on old man gasping trying to live he said it proves there somewhere you know I thought about that as brother Eddie laying there on a hospital bed slipping away from us gasping on a ventilator trying to breathe and I thought there's a body waiting on him that doesn't struggle to breathe alright by the gorge we're gonna go in succession all three of them start with one then two then three and so just give me your attention here for a minute because I want to show you the natural typing the spiritual you're gonna see what it threw the serpent in EVE you're going to see how Satan then can now come into your body and bring us a physical sickness like a virus and then you're going to see and you might not catch it until I start preaching on it but then you're going to see how Satan contaminates our minds and how that Jesus gives us an inoculation all right a man so let's go brother George we'll watch the first one first plenty of sound is how virus gets in body [Music] it's just like these are human cells that it's inside contact this is the moment when infection begins this is the moment when infection begins how does infection happen how do you see the tiny shapes there on the virus particle sir if you see the tiny shapes they're a seamless random long random block in reality they are tiny key in reality proteins that have evolved to the peripheral shape that has evolved to the perfect genital side to unlock these resembles m2 on the surface reselling cell on the surface of this smile and a handshake the virus the virus this is welcome cell and is welcomed in where it will command the cell more cells to make more virus particles interesting I notice it has keys and like a smile and a handshake it deceives the long cell into thinking it's harmless giving the next another Jorge every cell in your body is a tiny factory every cell in your body is a tiny factors constant your genetic protein or DNA direct cellular genetic directing making machinery in the cell reads the cells in may in a hurry in the cell and make sure this is Proteus Bay where they're needed and make sure the cell proteins go where they're needed viruses have their own genetic of irises of their own they don't have the machinery to copy they don't have the machinery to copy so viruses need your cells so viruses reproduce machinery to reproduce themselves a virus starts this process by useless noise on its surface by games injuries on its surface to gain entry like a Trojan horse it enters the cell Trojan horse it enters the cell [Music] the virus releases its own DNA into the unsuspecting cell and hijacks the protein making machinery now this vital cell function becomes an assembly line for new virus particles no longer in service to your body the cell now serves the virus manufacturing thousands of new virus particles which are released to enslave more cells thousands and thousands more now before we start the third one they're going to show you how they make vaccine so I want you to notice the language of the natural typing the spiritual you've got a virus cell now remember that brother branham when he deals in divine healing he talks about a tumor and he says it's just a multiplication of cells he says a lot of times it's cells that have back slid and they're not doing what they're supposed to be doing and they start multiplying and it creates a tumor he says now when I'm praying for someone I'm not dealing with the tumor he said I'm dealing with the life inside the tumor I'm commanding because the life inside it is a devil amen Jesus never the science causing all kinds of diseases brother Graham said whether it's cancer TB or a even names pneumonia viral pneumonia doesn't matter what it is bacterial he said it's a devil and he says then I I command the devil to leave and then he says then the virus shrinks I mean he said then the tumor shrinks inside the person who said if it's cataracts they'll start to shrink and then as that cataract or that tumor inside begins to corrupt because it's just it's just human cells multiplied it starts to break up because it's dead it has no life in it just like when Jesus walked up to the tree and cursed the life in the tree now the tree was still standing their tree didn't go anywhere but it the life was gone from it and by the next day they come and they can see it starting to wither so when the life goes out of that multiplication of cells then the body's own tender then the body's own chain of events set off it starts to shrink and then as it corrupts it swells and then people who had cataracts get healed and then in 72 hours corruption sets in those cells start swelling up their corrupting is what they are but then people go back blind and say oh I must have lost my healing brother branham says brother sister that is the best sign you got your healing and then sometimes he said if the tumor is inside your body then as it breaks down and rots within you because it's a dead sted collection of cells and then it starts to decay break up it poisons the bloodstream you get a fever you get sick you think you've lost your healing it's the best sign you've got your healing the heart rate increases you know everything's yo you you get violently ill but it's because it's your body's divine healing purging out all of that disease now notice that when this virus comes in it has an intelligence of its own alright and it uses the word the virus and I love the language it uses it deceives the lung cell into thinking I'm harmless it deceives the lung cell into thinking it's one of us and it lets it in and then as you saw what goes on when it goes in there remember that the virus doesn't have its own machinery now how many remember brother branham saying a devil is almost helpless unless he can get somebody to work through you follow me you got you getting this so now so now the virus doesn't have its own machinery it needs your machinery that God built into you you understand your cell upon cell you you rejuvenate cells that's how you stay alive and and and you eat food and and I'm not gonna go down into the biology of it sister Meredith Verlander who could give us a better breakdown but but we find that that the biology is what it's trying to get its hands on trying to get inside the cell and then it enslaves did you notice what it said it enslaves the cell and then that cell that even though it might not want to it was made in the image of God but now it starts using its own machinery to reproduce other viruses that are going to infect its brothers and sisters around it well going somewhere you got me I can see you're with me now let me let me before we get to that third one I'm just in my mind trying to figure out where I want to show that let me so now let me start back and look at Adam and Eve so now the serpent doesn't have a soul he's got a place for one so Satan can't create Satan doesn't have the machinery to create so he needs someone else's machinery you understand and so he's got to have Eve's machinery to reproduce children by you follow me so now what is he going to do you're gonna see multiple we could do multiple breakdowns of it first he's going to come and enter into the serpent and he's going to give the serpent a soul which is his own soul Lucifer's nature and now the serpent can think he can reason he can look at the word he can now have desires like human beings no wonder the serpent could say to Eve listen you be like God trust me I know this by experience I was just a brute animal walking around but now my eyes have come open and what's happening is the serpent isn't even aware that's the enemy talking through him the enemy now has has enslaved his mind - now reason the Word of God and talk to Eve and Eve now he could have never done it to Adam because Adam was was in the original creation building the image of God perfectly he was the fleshly distillation of the creative and Divine Word stamped with the divine aim there's no way Satan our tent serpents could have got to Adam but Eve now God holding her for the second phase in a bi-product she is she's comes from that first creation just like just like machinery produces byproducts and byproducts can be very useful and so it's not it's not a disparaging comment like some people say a woman's it's a byproduct that's not a disparaging remark it's just a scientific fact from the scripture so it comes now God separates out the feminist part the weaker part puts it in her and now she's vulnerable now she's not vulnerable at all as long as she stays fortified behind the word so Satan comes and through a smile and a handshake gets her to believe in her mind not she's got a soul so now he's going to communicate nature to nature through the lips of a serpent into the ears of Eve from the separate from Satan's heart down into Eve's heart you understand and through a smile and a handshake deceive her and believing he's okay and this is good for food and something to be desired you see you see the natural type in his spiritual all right so now so then the serpent became a medium or a carrier of this false word just like a virus that had no engine of its own so like the virus tricked the cell she believed his line.i brother Branham says it like this when she believed his li II then she received his LIF e amen now bear in mind Jesus is going to show us the principle that weather the weather a physical act of adultery takes place or not when you commit when you reject the Word of God you're already committing adultery against Christ as calling him your husband amen so now we find that as soon as Eve receives his lie in the mind of God she's already guilty of spiritual adultery with Lucifer through the infected spirit of the serpent who was infected with this lie from Lucifer you still with me all right so then Eve and I'm going to use brother branham's language for you even is she becomes a tool to make the connection from the fallen nature of Lucifer in the spirit world down into the spirit life inside man in the natural world she's going to produce another human who when he's born has an infection in his spirit you understand and it's it's not for holiness it's an infection it's not in the original Satan couldn't produce it on his own he didn't have the machinery so through lies and through deception he tricks God's God's sons wife into accepting this act it becomes a physical act and then and then he brings forth children and now because of this now every child that's born is born in sin because why it's a it's now a an out of control replication of a false word you should bring children forth let me show you how to do it she was never supposed to use that method Christ she would have eventually come to that but not the Serpent's way you understand and so now because now once that happened and she fell and then Adam realizing she would be killed who loved her played the part of Christ took her quickly brother Brennan said to himself have the same act with her because now he's putting his seed in her and now God can't touch her because he would be destroying a part of Adam do you understand friends that that's why Satan can't destroy even a part of God you are not God but you are a part of God you're just the fact that you have only his seed was enough to secure you for all eternity just one Act one discharge of seed inside her secured her from destruction God couldn't touch her just like Sarah Sarah lied to God that's blasphemy but God couldn't destroy her because she carried within her the seed of Abraham and she had become flesh of his flesh and bone of his bone I'm here to take something friends what you are in Christ is more than the devil wants you to believe you are but now we realize that every man then is is born through this way because now that the fall has happened now no more people can be born by the word until God does it himself in a virgin thousands of years later and God is going to not God's not going to need anybody's machinery he's got his own creative power hallelujah he's going to speak thus the egg and the seed he's going to place it in the incubation chamber of a woman's womb and then as and then as that little egg begins to and that cell begins to get a spine and he says it begins to push out arms and push out legs and he said then God steps down in and and what is born is now little baby Jehovah once again God has distilled himself into the literal image of the creative word stamped with a divine image so that God can then reverse-engineer Satan's infection so that now it's so powerful that even though you are born in sin and have no possibility to change it yourself God rich in mercy coming into Christ taking on the penalty of that sin than you just by simply receiving the word the Eve rejected and you receive it and say a man to it and the supernatural magical power of God reverses the whole situation and says you are now born again see now let's have the third video now we're going to show you how they make vaccine watch this thirdly human viruses are highly adapted to growing in humans viruses are highly adapted to growing in his mattresses reproduce thousands of times in human services replete access using specific receptors that each mouse s using specific receptors that match molecules on cell surfaces like athletes they get stronger and stronger by continually training under the same conditions and strength that makes it possible to weaken the virus this weakening is the key to making live vaccines how do scientists make this kind of vaccine by forcing the virus to grow in different kinds of cells in the lab in these chick embryo cells most of the virus particles that were so good at growing in humans can't access the chick cells but with sheer numbers on their side a few virus particles are able to unlock the chick cells infect them and begin adapting to this new environment the virus adapts by modifying its genes but there's a price to pay as the virus gets better and better at growing in the chick cells it gets worse and worse at growing in our cells now when reintroduced to the human body as a vaccine these modified or weakened viruses have a hard time infecting human cells the virus multiplies less efficiently giving the immune system the time it needs to gather information about the virus and mount an antibody response the vaccine provides immunity to natural infection without making us pay the price of natural infection now brother branham doesn't often use the word vaccine what brother branham uses is inoculation and he talks about how that Satan come because remember Satan had the power of death over man and this weary job thus we read David and we read Solomon and we read everybody and didn't matter how holy they ever were they could not go into the presence of God they were kept in a special compartment in the lower regions of the earth called paradise there was a great gulf fixed between the the paradise side and the prison side that was hell and so we realize but it still wasn't where they wanted to be you understand and even even even their limited because even when when when when you see Samuel or you see saw calling Samuel from the grave you notice you ever notice in the Bible that Samuel still an old man because young do yet that makes perfect sense if you think it through because the only body that Samuel can inhabit and reappear is the old body that went to the grave so he's got to pick it back up and he's upset why have you disturbed me from my rest why'd you make me come back into this old brokedown body again yeah you see friends that that when you when you begin to realize what God has done for us in living in Christ Jesus and so so we realized in that there they can't come into the presence of God until God comes in Christ and descends into the lower parts of the earth takes the keys of death and hell takes them from Satan unlocks paradise empties it a sins on high takes them into the presence of God and then comes back down lays that body on the altar as a perpetual atonement so to this very hour that blood is speaking for you and me and then he sent back that life down into the church now why is that life so important because that's the life that Satan struck his virus of death in the body of the Lord Jesus and when he struck his his stinger in the body of Christ he lost his stinger in other words he lost his power Jesus took that and it killed him but then Jesus being God had power to raise himself up again and now that life in Christ coming down inside of you gives you an inoculation against the enemy now how important is the Holy Ghost friends you have such an inoculation that Satan can you see that's why it said there's a price to pay the cell pays a horrible price in getting stronger it got so it got stronger when it took Samson it got stronger when it took David he got stronger when it took Elijah I when it took Isaiah he got stronger and took John but when he took Jesus there was a price to pay hallelujah now that life can come inside of us that has already built antibodies against this virus of death now so we realized then that that eve becomes a tool she becomes a tool to make a connection for the fallen nature and Lucifer to get to to transfer from the spirit realm into the natural realm of a man and he's born in sin all right now sickness and disease happened the same way brother Graham said every sickness is a fourth dimension disease when it starts understand so so it's in it's in the spirit realm and a devil has no Harlee no power at all until it can get a host a virus has no machinery of its own it's a harmless thing until it can get a factory if it can take over a human cell factory inside your body then it can replicate itself so now now so so so I'm coming down to this so you have machinery you have I don't want to deal too much we've already talked quite a bit about the natural machinery of your cells to reproduce more cells to keep you alive to heal you if you get a cut you have factories that'll close it and if a doctor needs to stitch it he can stitch it but he still can't heal it your little factories heal it you understand when you get sick you have factories that that that's how vaccine works it gives the body enough time to study that invader figure out an antibody reproduce an antibody response and overwhelm the virus and eradicate it from the body then we come down into the mind and brother branham talks about memory reason and conscience and affection and imagination so you have you have a human engine you have a machinery that animates this body and powers it as I said if that machinery if that engine stops leaves the body the body can't live without its engine you understand so now no no go with me keep keep right with me so you have an engine and and and when we talk about the engines you know there's all kinds of different engines and and there are differing natures in an engine because you have a soul and the soul is the nature of your spirit you understand so the spirit is your is your factor your spirit is your engine that's keeping you alive but every engine there's different natures there's fossil fuel engines there's steam engines there's electric engines there's nuclear engines they all burn different types of fuel and run on different principles you understand you got me all right now you have an engine human spirit it's the engine of life and you are a living soul like Genesis 2:7 you are a living being and your spirit has a nature the Spirit powers the body and the nature guides the spirit now it animates this spirit as your because you're a living soul it animates or it powers or it drives your body the soul is the nature of the spirit engine that powers the body and the mind your human engine now watch your human engine of life has only one of two natures running in its lines only one of two it only has one of two fuels on the human engine spirit you understand it either has a fallen Adamic from Adam a Demick it has a fallen Adamic nature from Adam and that's its nature see or it has a redeemed Zoe nature from Christ the second Adam now went before you're born again that your body is animated and driven and has an engine of a spirit that only has one fuel burning and that's a fallen nature and there's no battle there's no warfare you go right along you're a happy sinner caring right along you might have struggles and loneliness and depression you your lunch searching for something you know as we were all searching you know and God searching for us and we were searching for something that that was something of eternal quality crying out inside you but it doesn't come to life until you're born again now so the fallen nature from Adam even when you're born again you know there's still this fuel that fuels these ten inlets and outlets of the flesh and the mind the Bible teaches us that among whom we also had our conversation in times past in the lusts of the flesh fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind and we're by nature the children of Wrath even as others let me hurry so the new birth then is is literally I will call it like this the new birthday is the annihilation of the former nature in the realm of the soul and a brand new nature roars to life you understand a brand new nature down inside that spirit cranks up and starts operating the the old former nature in the soul is annihilated that fuel is gone that soul is a completely brand-new person or with a nature that's already connected to God amen and so we find out that it had actually been there all along just dormant so these two completely different natures are now available in the spirit engine of life within you that's why it's called the greatest battle ever fought before the new birth there's no fight your nature your soul agrees with the Fallen spirit that you got from Adam and Eve who were tricked by the serpent who was in who was infected by Lucifer amen and so now when you're born again you find out now that you've got this new fuel but now the default powers the default fuel powers the motions of sin in the flesh and mind the fuel of eternal life powers motions of righteousness in the flesh and the mind so it depends on what's fueling the spirit because your spirit your flesh is not born again it's still fallen it's still infected and that's why you've got to start living by the life of the inner man that new nature which is Zoe which is Christ which is the inoculation and you go about your daily life every day of your life burning one fuel or the other see all thoughts all actions are given fuel by one of these two nature's and all you have to do to figure out which fuel you're burning is are you running in the motions of sin and your flesh the motions of sin and your in your mind is your mind the playground of the enemy all the time and you you you you Harbor that criminal activity you Harbor those thoughts you don't cast them down as the Bible says you don't you don't whatsoever things are pure and what server things are lovely whatsoever things are of a good report think on these cast down vain imaginations cast down anything that exalts itself against the Word of God which which which fuel is your spirit feeding on does your spirit feed on the fuel it needs for righteousness or does your spirit which animates your body fuel on on Hollywood or the world you understand this ain't rocket science now friends this is y'all know what I'm talking about as human beings as sons and daughters of God we understand what this is this is me dying daily this is me exalting the word in my life this is me having a discipline of prayer that a life in my life this is me having a discipline of the Bible having a discipline of fellowship having a discipline of communication with God or is all of your communication with Laodicea and then you wonder why your the motions of sin worked so freely in your flesh it ain't a mystery see now watch this so all thoughts and all actions are given fuel by one of these two natures now brother branham is going to make a statement from the serpent seed and he starts talking about women which brother Branham was always railing against ill-famed women he was never brother Brenda you know labeled as a woman-hater Paul was labeled as that too brother Brandon while he admits to problems in his early childhood from things that he saw but yet the Holy Ghost New Birth gave him a love and an appreciation for godly women so much so that he called them the greatest thing for that God ever give a man outside of his eternal salvation was a wife all right so so brother Branham says speaking to these women who don't let Christ rule in their lives they get out and strip he says you get out here and strip your little shorty shorts and tie a little ribbon around like that and your baby and you're gonna cigarette out of hanging out of your mouth walking down the street you don't do it for no good purpose you might be innocent of the fact he's talking about you maybe you never commit adultery but but you in God's eyes you're gonna stand with the prostitutes even though you might be true to your husband because you present yourself that way and he says it like this the devil is using you for a tool just like he did Eve you see there so a woman dressed bad then is a tool like a virus that has no motor of its own but uses the engine of a man's fallen nature see she she's not going to go have an act with that man but when she presents herself that way he's going something's going to happen in his visuals and he's going to think a thought and God's gonna write it on his record that he committed adultery and it's gonna get written on her record that she also did because she if there's no power to make that happen in her but but by transmitting her spike transmitting herself in the wrong way she's going to infect his human mind and he's going to become guilty he might as well have committed the physical act so women dress bad is like a tool like a virus that had has no motor of its own no machinery of its own but it can't cause damage in and of itself but it literally caused that causes damage because it uses the engine of the man's fallen nature now I thought about this today as I was studying and I I thought to myself you know I'm not here and I wanted to say that I wanted to make that statement that I'm really not here tonight to take the stereotypical road that always seems to single out women now while it's true there is a let me say it like this it is true that in this last day and age according to the Bible there is a demonic anointing that is released on women at the end time sisters who are listening tonight beware there is a special set of special forces Devils who have one purpose in life and that's to anoint women in the last days now we could talk about all of the correlations in the scription we could talk about Revelation 13 and sin you know ending ending its run ah 13 being the number of America and that's where sin you know it makes its last stand in the United States because this as far west as it can go as the Lightning cometh out east even under the West and it walls up at Hollywood and he said that's why it's so sinful there and so perverted and you see the red carpet things that are so twisted it's because all the sin is heaped up there that's been coming westward for centuries and then for two centuries it's been come for it for two millennia it's been coming westward and and right here in America Revelation 13 is where sin makes its last stand and that's why it's a woman's nation elation 13 we could talk about how that the Antichrist church system is symbolized as a great and powerful woman catch it again the Antichrist church system is symbolized in the book of Revelation as a great and powerful woman who is who secretly practices sorcery and the name of Christ while it is true then that that that that if allowed you know Satan always seeks to use a woman of this fallen world as a very robust fuel delivery system to fallen man she's a very robust Transport entrance / tation delivery system - fallen man because she's out there on the streets dressing herself and and it wasn't it was the morals of woman of the falling of women's morals that brother Branham saw in his vision that was that literally was what was going to bring the whole world down and so we realized then that that it is incumbent on me its own coming on me as a preacher always to strike out it's in when I see it in heaping up in an ungodly practices on the streets I'm obligated as a preacher but my preach my primary preaching isn't to them do you realize that my primary preaching my preaching isn't primarily sent to preach to them say why brother Jason because a prophet of the last stage has already served a blanket indictment handed down from God's a Supreme Court my God doesn't need me to go behind the Prophet and redo that you understand now granted I'm always preaching in sin whenever I see it heaping up we always strike against it but but but I ministered to all I do minister to all but but my ministry fall in the final boys to the final age is not to Laodicea which has already gone dark and has already been judged and it's already been indicted my primary mission is to believe her sister's preaching to them preaching to believers sisters that they're not to partake of her sins the great the Mystery Babylon they're not to partake of her sins that filthy prostitute woman Church who's controlling and influencing the whole world my sisters were not my sisters let me say to you today you were not placed here - to receive of her plagues my ministry is to challenge and inspire you to rise higher and fly higher and move above all of that to rise above the pressure of the age that is trying to hold you back from everything that God has planned for you however there are many more fuel delivery services than women ministers are a major supplier ministers if if if they're not founded on the revealed truth they're one of the most robust fuel delivery systems in the world because they literally have the confidence of millions of people who hear them watered down the Word of God I mean I mean friends oh yeah I mean sometimes the imagery I think about you know it's almost like they open their Bible and just drowning all the ink runs together and you can't even turn the pages it's all a watered down gouache I believe the world needs it preached straight right exactly what God has revealed in this day it has restored in this last day and so so we we realized that there's many more fuel delivery systems for fallen man's name sure then just an ill-dressed woman on a nil somesome preacher who just has it for a meal ticket and won't tell the people the truth he's a he's a far more dangerous huh you talking about a dangerous human animal I wanna say this it might make you uncomfortable parents sharing this top honor - sure do parents share in the top honors as fuel delivery system because they literally literally and physically set every standard and practice that children are indoctrinated long before the preacher ever gets a crack at them parents set every standard and every practice that they are indoctrinated by you know and my experienced friends I got I have us I have a many great things and many great testimonies and many things that just I well up with tears of gratitude before God because of the while this is a this is not a position I ever wanted to be in I never wanted to be over other men I never wanted to live off of the support of other people I never wanted to have that kind of responsibility I wouldn't have it today I love you all enough I just sit right in the middle of you and we'd have somebody that would take their responsibility but God made me do it and I'm probably never getting out of it because brother Branham says the only kind of man God can use is a man who don't want to do it and God almost has to force him to do it but at the same time I'm not trying to get a pity party from you because it is also the most rewarding thing I think I could ever do in life to be trusted with the souls of men and people place their confidence and trust their families to you and and and and you see people delivered from sin and you see people lifted up on high you see the sick healed and you see the sinner turn to Saints oh there's nothing like it since a child I only ever wanted to do this you wouldn't you it but one of the sad areas of my ministry is that I've had parents who were so destructive to their children spiritually mentally emotionally far more than physically you'd be as a child physically we got jails for you but but what goes undiagnosed is the spiritual poisoning the emotional damage and I've had parents literally undo years of ministry work years of ministry labor behind this pulpit and every time you see me step into this pulpit for one hour it represents weeks of prayer and study and hours of burning midnight oil and up in the morning thing about it in the middle of the day and sitting in the bed late at night and you're fast asleep and it's 3:00 a.m. and I'm still making notes because I'm so inspired I can't go to sleep and because I'm a the son of Annie Watkins if even if I go to sleep at 3 a.m. I still wake up by 6:30 7 o'clock at the latest if I'm in the bed at 8 I have so drastically overslept it's a Guinness Book of World Records and my body just wakes up when the room gets light even if I don't go to sleep till late and so I I've had times I've had young people that I know today who are teenagers who are young adults 20-somethings who are blown to smithereens think and and the parent was able to undo all of those years and hours and hours of study and preaching and praying and and and had them ready and had them going and then the parents flip out sometimes for just six eight twelve months and completely blow that child to kingdom come I'm here to tell you something friends we don't want to be fuel delivery systems for the enemy I don't want to be a fuel transportation of the from this fallen world to you to my family to my grandchildren I wanna I want to give them the inoculation of the Holy Ghost I wonder if we realize that we can all be tools to spread the most infectious sicknesses of sin to those around us I wonder friends tonight have we given ample consideration I've I've showed you here the natural typing the spiritual listen that you say all the devil the devil has almost no power unless he can get a medium to work through how to say Lord God you know don't don't let my insincerity be the vehicle be the field delivery that's what's destroyed I've seen that's what's destroyed so many times young people undestroyed years of ministry be just by by by uh even sometimes a short span of time of a insincerity in the mom or dad or both that the child sees and and it's just long enough to set up a ruination that sometimes it can take god years to get that thing turned around and then they come back scarred up cut up needlessly unnecessarily I'm not I'm not here to try to project here that I was the perfect parent and I'm not here to project to you that it's always a parent's fault when a child goes astray I mean I had a man Eve had the best parent you could have God and they lived in a perfect paradise and they still back slit so I'm not I'm not saying I'm not here to heap blame I'm just saying where we stand today the world is falling apart and demon powers are streaming into the earth these are where the whole world is worried about a virus that affects the body and Jesus said don't even fear him who can destroy the body but fear that one who can destroy the soul in hell and everybody's worried about a virus that can hurt the body 1% fatality and their nerd they're unconcerned with a virus that is a hundred percent fatal 100 percent fatal reject God's inoculation and you fall victim to a virus you can't recover from and rich young ruler thought he could he thought his wealth would protect him he had by had so much he said I gotta tear down all my giant barns and build bigger barns he didn't notice the very large being standing behind him and the angel dust said you fool this is all you care about work money gain more work more money more gain you fool today you didn't wake up thinking this to you you woke up today like it was any other day little did you know you fool that today your soul is going to be required of you he had caught a virus that Jesus offered him a vaccine for him Jesus offered him an inoculation but he knew that if he got the inoculation it would change his whole life and he liked his life pretty good and it was all fine and it was all great until it wasn't and then the Bible says and in hell he lifted up his eyes and regret I want to tell you something friends stand stand with me Deb come to the piano just just come alone yeah we'll just play a song and go to prayer but I want you to realize friends today the world is running crazy over a bug that's a variant of a flu bug it's bringing down the world the fear as I said to you Sunday the fear is inexplicable the fear is non sensible it doesn't make sense that they're so afraid of this and and you say but thousands are gonna die every year almost 70,000 people die every year just from the flu 40 to 70 died last year 40 to 70 will die this year it doesn't matter Korona now tell my Corona taking them we're talking about just the common flu and before we even were at a hundred deaths the world was collapsing the only explanation as I said to you Sunday the only way to explain that is it's a modern event only explainable by prophecy that at the last days because that knowledge would increase men would run to and fro and increase their knowledge and knowledge would increase which means he's eating off the tree of knowledge and brother Branham said the more he eats the more death he gets and then and and now the and then the other prophecy that connects to that is in the last days men's hearts would fail them for fear because because in the in the days when they didn't have the knowledge like we showed in 1957 no one even knew 100,000 people died no one even knew it was going on and even people who didn't know what was going on they didn't care they didn't shut down schools and colleges and businesses and baseball and nobody was blaming Eisenhower and he wasn't making everyday announcements on the news you couldn't stay home and work from home it was 1957 so this this 80 year old reporter I don't know if you all read that story I posted he just said so we just went to work and we just went okay well if I die I'd die he said you just lived with that death was they they weren't afraid of it why because Manhattan he hadn't eat so far on that tree of knowledge he hadn't come to the point where his heart would fail him for fear what you're seeing today man has destroyed himself and and as that and as that poem that that brother from Africa wrote said if one plague just one plague one virus has done all this what will you do when it's plague upon plague upon plague upon plague he said welcome to a dress rehearsal and the world can't handle the dress rehearsal of one virus they actually could but they're too afraid and their fear has infected them like a virus I want us tonight I want you to who are listening on the stream and you brothers here sister Deborah here tonight all of us here together want you to bow your heads with me and I want you to think about what you've heard what I've explained to you show you how the natural types the spiritual and showing it to you how we got to fall how we got fallen bodies how the devil works in in physical diseases how he infects the mind how unbelief comes in how families and people and marriages and children get ruined all heads bowed now hide over the airwaves those of you streaming bow your heads I want you to think now there is an inoculation and this inoculation is good to get you home on and it doesn't it doesn't this inoculation doesn't take away your right to choose to burn the other fuel what this inoculation does is pass you from death to life so that you can never be lost but I'm not I'm not worried about being lost when I went out what concerns me is I won't Daly Victor in my life I want to burn the right fuel I want to have the right mind I want to have the right actions I want to have the right reactions I haven't even asked but hands are already going up how many want it let's raise up those hands you want it out there across the airwaves you want that raise up that hand to God young people mom dad raise up that hand to God and say Lord Oh grab that I'll burn

pray for all these hands that went up Lord all over parts of the country listening right now I pray Lord that you'll look under those hands and lift us up hope God lifts us up above the shadows let us draw from that well that runs deep Lord from under the throne of God draw deep from that channel of the Holy Ghost this is why it came this is why we have it let us use it Lord I don't want my actions I don't want to be Lord I don't want to be the machinery that transmits a devil's plan on to somebody I don't want to be the connector I don't want to be the connection made where Satan trying to infect a person can't get to him but he knows he can get to him through me don't let it be Lord don't let it be let it be that the Holy Ghost will use me as the connection to reach to others let it be that righteousness will flow from the Holy Ghost out through me and that I will bring a healing ointment and a healing balm to the sick and weary Lord grant grant us that that we might give that vaccine that inoculation of the Holy Ghost to others grant it to us tonight Lord we love you for your greatness father we thank you for your word tonight Lord we're coming to a close we're gonna pray for sick people just in a moment but I just want us in this stillness of this moment Lord think deeply on what we've heard tonight I've been thinking deeply about it Lord I've been thinking deeply about it for days and all day today Lord the more I studied this the more gripping it came to me and I just said Lord don't ever let me be the transmitter of of a sin virus don't ever let me be the carrier of that I don't want to be a feel delivery system for that I want to be of a delivery system of righteousness I want to be able to deliver love and holiness and peace and tranquility I want to deliver faith and virtue I want to deliver the qualities and characteristics of the zowie life down within me help me Lord God I'm thankful Lord that you took that stinger of death that that that virus that had taken the lives of your greatest champions none of them could withstand it there was no cure for that virus called death it even took you Lord it even killed you and you gave your life and laid it down but Lord you had the ability to pick it back up and that virus of death paid a terrible price for stinging you now Lord your life has conquered death your antibody response conquered that virus of death and now you can infuse us with the antibodies of the inoculation of the Holy Ghost we get a we get it we get something injected into our bloodstream that sin can never take me again I am immune I am immune from the virus of death I have believed on the Son of God therefore I can never die that was your promise whoever believes on me will never see death he will never die what a promise I want to live daily Lord and service to youth I want to be a delivery system of your right thinking and you're right acting you're right reacting you're right motives you're right dreams and plans you're correct vision for my life granted to us we commit it to you in Jesus name Amen let me read my request here that we have for prayer brother Larry writes I have a prayer request for the Jason a longtime friend his brother Larry writing a longtime friend of mine is battling non-hodgkin lymphoma for the second time I just found out and the only thing I could tell him is God can heal you again and I will ask the church to pray for him think he was a little shocked but God an aim but I got an a man out of him also my sister-in-law teri Upshaw has a serious lung infection and again we will go to our great physician for her healing thank you and god bless every saint well Larry I also have a request but Luther is there any update did he have that surgery today or at noon

Luther I'm just making sure I don't have any other I've got a couple other requests but I'm making sure I don't have any that I haven't seen yeah brother Luther has his son with a surgery about blockage so ever so they're supposed to take his gallbladder that was at noon today and brother Luther also has a special unspoken request we missed a prayer request last Wednesday from sister Elizabeth she says remembers Starr who has has had cancer the doctor has found a spot on her breast she is waiting for results from biopsy let's pray for that need my wife sister Debbie sent in a request for her brother-in-law her sister's husband Greg needs to be on the prayer list tonight he has a sore throat so you can imagine what how that could grip someone and he's he's the one Greg and Karen they actually watch are probably watching right now I would imagine and he is the one who most often drives brother Richard my wife's dad to his dialysis I think three days a week and so he can't he can't be sick and then you understand how that's gonna complicate things so let's just pray whatever it is it's gone tonight a man so you'll be actually praying for brother Richard situation as you pray for Greg amen trusting the Lord you will do great things here don't have any other requests that I see let me just do one quick check here again this to remind you that if you have a prayer request send it to me whatsapp directly to my whatsapp because I can get it if you send it regular SMS but I might miss it I need everything coming to one place please and then even sometimes I still miss it so amen I know we're just a few brothers why don't you guys are coming up here and stand to stand up here and just stay spread out a little bit so we can follow the guidelines man Chris move on over just a little bit son brother Luther come on up in here we're not living in fear but we're just trying to respect our fellow community if they would if they would ask us we can say no we're following the guidelines we're trying to be careful we've even got some plans if this should go long-term and it might by the way they're talking now this thing could get much worse it absolutely could get much worse in the next couple of weeks because what we're seeing now is worse than last week and what we're seeing now is what was happening two weeks ago so now they're saying it could escalate again based on that the next week or two so we don't know France I just know who knows every I know the one who knows everything as we said Sunday I I don't we don't even know what all we don't even know so I just decided well then I'm just gonna make sure I know the one who knows it all so we're not in fear at all we lift up our head we're trusting the Lord for our safety but we do want to respect what they're asking of us and so you know we'll we'll we'll practice some distancing and you know that way if you're asked you can give a testimony I would say that you brothers just fist bump or elbow touch don't even shake hands and don't embrace because it's all about our testimony all right so let's just go ahead and dispense with the awkwardness of do i do idon't know let's just not okay let's just distance as far as we can and and keep us keep us safe we don't know the Lord may protect all of his bride from this but we don't know that I could get the flu I've had the flu so I don't know I don't care I'm not worried about what the devil is doing amen I just don't Cary's I tell him all the time he's your nobody you have no decision power in my life that all comes from my father a man I don't consult the devil as brother Abraham taught me that years ago we do not live by the mercies of Lucifer done I live by the mercies of Jesus Christ and I want the world and Lucifer to know and that's who my hope is built on nothing less than Jesus blood and righteousness amen let's pray father we thank you thank you for your guiding hand in this life lord thank you for our gathering tonight thank you for your word thank you for your presence I know it come from You Lord let it let it let this sermon Lord and this technical teaching side of it Lord I hope I got it

all anyway you the technical side is not as important as getting the main event Lord we understand that we don't want to be transmitters of the enemy's influences that's the bottom line tonight Lord I want to be the conduit of your life I want to be the conductor of your righteousness to all of those around me Lord may you grant it tonight we commit this need Lord for brother Luther that he has Lord this need that brother Larry has wrote in about Lord God this need that sister Elizabeth has wrote these are friends Lord and family members father the the need father of Greg Lord Karen's

infection were to get her their body and try to follow him home as soon as they walked into that token applied home it would be uh niya lated in the name of Jesus Christ granite Lord God granite father these brothers who and sisters sometimes they can't even though most people aren't going to work but some of them have to be involved Lord and I pray that that Eunice let the aura of the Holy Spirit if a devil would get even nearly and run for his life Lord granite Lord Jesus well now that I'm asking Lord if anybody infected comes near one of your children may the Holy Spirit heal their body Lord may it be so Lord God hallelujah Lord Jesus hallelujah Lord father may the presence of the bride living in Buford and Jasper counties may it eliminate this virus from our counties Lord God

Holy Spirit drive back spirits of unbelief granite Lord may you shame the devil for his audacity to try to and to comment to come at your family with these endtime plagues and diseases may it not be so Lord we ask all of these things in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen means so be it hallelujah it's 5:00 to 9:00 anybody got a testimony before we go praise Lord sure Chris let me get you a mic here all right I just want to give us a quick testimony about God's protection on the road we all know that the world's crazy drivers are crazy I don't not sure what was happening with this particular genre but I told my wife I was just was two days ago just driving along headed to the bank I think and then back to my house now thinking about much listening to some music just really kind of praying in my mind actually as we were driving along and I kind of just looked out the window and as I turned to look up a semi-truck without his rig but just the big truck portion was two tires into the middle lane and probably 15 feet from me and I didn't my eyes got I didn't really know you kind of freeze in that moment I kind of started to veer to the right and it was almost like an angel just pushed this car because it came and just went and just correct it at the last second I thought man well that was that was that was a man praise him or a man praise God just you know I got attacked on Sunday I was like when I got home from church I couldn't do nothing I was like I don't know what a migraine headache is like I just but I was just I was down for the count and I just texted for the Jason I just said Ben I don't feel well at all and I got sick about three o'clock and then I was just just sitting on the couch and waiting about seven o'clock I started feeling normal I had a little bit of a headache I just rested up a little bit on Monday and good to go I just want to thank the Saints for their prayers hallelujah amen brother Luther wrote me later on that evening said I feel great and I'm hungry I said okay normal man amen god bless you thank you all for coming sister Deborah thank you for coming to play being away from your family god bless you sister I told

until they tell us we can't or if it goes beyond four weeks tonight begins the second week for us we finished a Wednesday and Sunday this will be a Wednesday and Sunday if we do that two more whole times than we might start adjusting our long-term plan and I've got some ideas with regard to that will no need going into it now let's hope that we don't need it let's hope that we get back together soon amen I'm miss seeing everybody out here I felt so sorry for sister Debbie poor things she was just crying on Saturday night just thinking that she wasn't gonna get to come to church I tell you I married at the girl loves church she's loved going to church since she was a little girl she used to go with her papi he was an old tariff revivalist old tempreture and when nobody else in her whole family was going to church she would go I think what nothing but eight nine ten years old whatever but every service her papi pull in and get her and she loves going to church and so she is so pitiful
