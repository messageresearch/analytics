[38:45] romans chapter 7 if you have your bible
[38:47] we'll turn straight to the word thank
[38:49] you
[38:50] amen
[38:51] that was a wonderful
[38:52] spirit of worship there aren't you so
[38:54] grateful the lord
[38:56] can visit us when we invite him amen he
[38:58] comes where he's invited romans chapter
[39:00] 7 i'd like to just take a text here
[39:04] and a thought that
[39:06] i know that i won't have time to finish
[39:08] i just feel so overloaded and
[39:10] weighed down and um but that's all right
[39:13] we'll get to the portion the lord has
[39:15] for us and then
[39:16] and then the lord if he sees fit we'll
[39:18] continue this some other time romans
[39:20] chapter 7 we just want to begin
[39:23] reading here and i want to
[39:25] um
[39:26] i want to title this
[39:28] being changed
[39:30] being
[39:31] changed
[39:32] let's just begin reading here
[39:36] at verse seven
[39:40] let's let's move beyond that we're just
[39:41] going to save time
[39:43] verse 12 wherefore the law is holy and
[39:45] the commandment holy and just and good
[39:48] was then that which is good made death
[39:51] unto me god forbid sin that it might
[39:53] appear sin worketh death in me by that
[39:56] which is good
[39:58] sin by the commandment might become
[40:14] i do i allow not
[40:17] for what i would
[40:18] that do i not
[40:20] but what i hate
[40:22] that do i if then i do
[40:25] that which i would not
[40:27] i can send unto the law that it is good
[40:31] now then it is no more i that do it but
[40:33] sin that dwelleth in me
[40:36] for i know that in me that is in my
[40:38] flesh
[40:39] dwelleth no good thing
[40:42] for to will is present with me but how
[40:44] to perform that which is good i find not
[40:48] for the good that i would i do not but
[40:52] the evil which i would not
[40:54] that i do
[40:56] now if i do that i would not
[41:00] it is no more i that do it but sin that
[41:02] dwelleth in me i find then a law
[41:06] that when i would do good evil is
[41:08] present with me
[41:10] for i delight in the law of god after
[41:12] the inward man
[41:14] but i see another law in my members
[41:16] warring against the law of my mind
[41:19] and bringing me into captivity to the
[41:21] law of sin
[41:22] which is in my members
[41:24] o wretched man that i am
[41:27] who shall deliver me from the body of
[41:29] this death
[41:30] i thank god through jesus christ our
[41:33] lord so then with the mind i myself
[41:36] serve the law of god but with the flesh
[41:39] the law of sin
[41:40] we bow our heads tonight
[41:42] lord jesus
[41:44] we just need you right now father we
[41:46] need your help have mercy lord god upon
[41:49] us i pray that you would just have grace
[41:52] that you would pour it out abundantly
[41:53] lord to your children
[41:55] those lord that have gathered here
[41:56] tonight on a wednesday those that are
[41:58] listening by stream or by later maybe in
[42:01] an archive i pray that your word would
[42:04] just come and meet their need we believe
[42:06] father that you're the same today
[42:09] yesterday and forever that you don't
[42:11] change lord i pray god that you would
[42:13] come by your word by your promised lord
[42:16] that you would be wherever two or three
[42:18] are gathered there you would be in our
[42:20] midst so we're gathered here tonight
[42:22] lord in your spirit we've invited you
[42:24] we've sang we've worshipped lord we've
[42:26] read your word now god i pray that you
[42:29] would come and do what we can't do in
[42:31] every heart and every life
[42:33] may you get glory from it in jesus
[42:35] christ's name and the church said
[42:37] amen you can be seated
[42:39] romans chapter 7 if you'll hold that
[42:41] there with me and then also just have my
[42:44] powerpoint ready i'm going to read some
[42:46] things that i have on the powerpoint and
[42:50] then there are some things that i didn't
[42:51] have time to put up but i just want to
[42:53] go through them i believe it's so
[42:55] important that we uh romans 7 especially
[42:59] is what you would maybe call a debated
[43:02] controversial passage
[43:04] and many opinions have been taken
[43:06] upon this passage uh by different if you
[43:09] read just commentaries of
[43:11] biblical commentators you'll find a
[43:14] multitude of different opinions
[43:17] some believe
[43:18] maybe paul was not referring to himself
[43:21] was this a reference that he's speaking
[43:23] about his own struggle or is he just
[43:25] speaking generically or generally about
[43:28] people
[43:29] is paul talking about a person who's not
[43:32] been born again and this is a pre-state
[43:34] when he speaks about and says i'm no
[43:37] good thing in my flesh and i find that a
[43:40] law that when i would want to do good
[43:42] evil's present and i find that the
[43:44] things that i want to do i don't do and
[43:47] those things that i don't want to do i
[43:49] find myself doing and so paul is talking
[43:52] about this inner nature this two natures
[43:55] this
[43:56] this flesh that wars against this nature
[43:59] of the spirit
[44:01] and he begins to to relate here and
[44:03] we've preached this has been spoken on
[44:05] many times i'm not going to get too
[44:06] bogged down into the teaching of it but
[44:09] i just want to highlight just a few
[44:11] things because i believe it's important
[44:13] we have a biblical
[44:15] understanding
[44:16] of and a right understanding of the
[44:19] truth of what paul is actually saying
[44:21] here and i'm so glad we have the light
[44:23] of the message that has brings clarity
[44:26] in the midst of confusion we always have
[44:28] an answer
[44:29] and so is paul speaking about here in
[44:32] this romans 7 14 through is he's
[44:35] speaking about a person who's not born
[44:37] again this is this is what paul
[44:39] experienced
[44:40] prior to being born of the spirit
[44:43] or is this a believer is he speaking
[44:46] about the struggle
[44:48] of a person who's been born again or is
[44:51] he saying that this is something that
[44:53] takes place before you receive the
[44:55] baptism of the holy ghost and then after
[44:57] you receive the baptism of the holy
[44:59] ghost then that struggle is over and and
[45:03] and there's no more war and the war is
[45:05] over and now you live by the law of the
[45:07] spirit well let me just say that the in
[45:10] in one way as much as there is answers
[45:13] in in every
[45:15] time that you have a question and
[45:17] there's multiple answers there's usually
[45:19] truth in both answers
[45:22] and and most people are seeing a part of
[45:25] truth but maybe not all of it then the
[45:27] other one who would give a different
[45:28] answer sees a portion of that truth but
[45:31] maybe he doesn't see all of it so you
[45:33] could say it could apply to anybody is
[45:36] paul speaking here generically
[45:38] about anybody yes is he speaking about
[45:41] himself personally yes he's telling us
[45:44] about a real personal struggle that's
[45:46] why he says uh o wretched man that i am
[45:50] who shall deliver me so he's speaking
[45:52] personally here is he speaking to a
[45:54] struggle uh prior to the new birth and
[45:57] pride and then after the new birth yes
[45:59] both both are true
[46:01] this is something that that uh that i
[46:04] believe brother branham answers so
[46:05] clearly and i'm just going to read and i
[46:07] wish i would have had time to put it on
[46:08] the screen and i didn't so let me just
[46:10] read here and you just pay attention as
[46:12] best that you can i'm going to skip a
[46:14] lot of this because a lot of it just is
[46:17] very long brother branham says let me
[46:19] just kind of polish it up as you can see
[46:21] paul said in me as two persons two
[46:24] persons
[46:25] one wants me to do wrong the other one
[46:28] wants me to do every time i start to do
[46:31] right then wrong hinders me
[46:33] you are an outward man which is
[46:35] controlled by six senses you are an
[46:38] inward man controlled by one sense which
[46:41] is faith
[46:43] and this faith disagrees with all six
[46:46] senses
[46:47] if the sixth senses don't agree with
[46:50] faith let me read that again he says and
[46:52] this faith disagrees with all six senses
[46:54] if the six senses don't agree with faith
[46:57] but one is contrary to the other now as
[47:00] long as the six senses agree with the
[47:03] faith wonderful but when the six senses
[47:06] disagrees with faith lead then leave the
[47:10] six senses alone
[47:13] now for instance here jesus made a
[47:15] statement a promise the inside man says
[47:17] that's true the outside man reasons that
[47:19] it can't be true to you
[47:21] then ignore the outside man and accept
[47:25] the inside man
[47:26] [Applause]
[47:27] now that's the same thing paul is
[47:29] speaking of he was sold under under the
[47:31] law to carnal sin every one of us is the
[47:34] same that's the reason we have the
[47:36] troubles we do of married four or five
[47:39] times and that all kinds of sin
[47:41] adulteries and everything else along in
[47:44] our life is because of those things we
[47:46] are carnal and that part must perish
[47:51] but then inside we are a spirit man soul
[47:54] inside and that's faith in god's he says
[47:58] and that's faith in god's word then we
[48:00] bring our outside body under subjection
[48:04] to the word by faith
[48:06] by accepting what god said
[48:10] that's important you've got to accept
[48:13] what god said or you'll never bring this
[48:15] outward intellect
[48:17] under subjection to what faith tells you
[48:19] right
[48:21] how can i take a cocker bro listen to
[48:22] this what brother says i'm going to take
[48:24] a cockle burrow and make a grain of
[48:25] wheat out of it it's impossible for me
[48:27] to do it the only way it can be done is
[48:31] because inside that cocklebur has been
[48:33] transmitted from a cocker bore we from a
[48:35] cockapur wheat a cocker bro to a germ
[48:38] called wheat life
[48:40] then you bury that cocklebur and it'll
[48:43] produce a grain of wheat because there
[48:46] has been a life of wheat put in it
[48:50] and the life of that cocklebur has been
[48:53] taken out but the nature of the
[48:55] cocklebur is still sticky
[48:58] and it will be until this new life has
[49:01] been fully developed out of the ground
[49:04] and raised up again
[49:06] when it comes forth then it's no more
[49:08] cocklebur but wheat
[49:11] but listen but while it's here on earth
[49:16] and in the out of the earth a cocklebur
[49:18] it's still sticky
[49:20] but it's got the nature on the inside of
[49:23] it that's wheat
[49:25] and as long as you're in this life
[49:27] listen to me very carefully because this
[49:29] is the way brother branham says this is
[49:30] just beautiful hallelujah uses this and
[49:33] he's answering romans 7 what paul is
[49:36] speaking of here he says and as long as
[49:38] you're in this life you're going to be
[49:41] sticky and have a carnal nature that's
[49:44] going to bother you as long as you live
[49:47] but the inside of you you're born again
[49:52] and when you're raised up you're in the
[49:55] likeness of christ and all the sin is
[49:57] gone from you see that's the thing may i
[49:59] say this brother adam begins to speak
[50:02] about an indian and he talks about this
[50:03] man who he could only say uh me sick and
[50:06] you i'm gonna skip this but brother
[50:08] madam speaks of the indian man and he's
[50:10] saying me sick and that's the only
[50:11] english and billy paul's trying to get
[50:13] him to tell him what what's your problem
[50:15] because daddy told me not to take anyone
[50:16] with a tummy ache or something small
[50:18] it's got to be major and chief just kept
[50:20] saying me sick and brother and meets him
[50:22] later he's been converted and brother
[50:24] branham has a talk with him and and let
[50:27] me just move it here and he and and he
[50:28] says uh come to find out he said i
[50:30] talked to that missionary he said
[50:32] brother branham uh he said he said
[50:34] that's all he can say he said i taught
[50:36] him to say me sick that's the only thing
[50:38] that's right so that's the thing about
[50:39] it let me just move because i want to
[50:41] make sure i don't yeah here it is right
[50:43] here he says someone told me though he
[50:45] was converted he received the holy ghost
[50:48] and he said to him how are you getting
[50:50] along he said pretty good and pretty bad
[50:53] this is the chief pretty good and pretty
[50:55] bad he said well how do you mean pretty
[50:57] bad and pretty good he said well since
[51:00] me received the holy ghost he said
[51:03] there's been two dogs in me
[51:06] and one of them a black dog and one of
[51:09] them a white dog and said they argue all
[51:13] the time
[51:14] they growl and fight at one another and
[51:17] said the white dog wants me to do good
[51:20] the black dog wants me to do bad
[51:23] said well chief which one of them wins
[51:26] the fight
[51:27] chief said that depends on which one
[51:30] chief feeds the most
[51:31] so i think that's a good answer here see
[51:35] there just depends on the warning of the
[51:37] body that's in you it depends on which
[51:40] one you cater to
[51:42] which nature you cater to
[51:44] the carnal nature after the things of
[51:46] the world or the spiritual nature after
[51:50] the things of god
[51:52] that does it
[51:54] that does it
[51:55] let's go just a little bit further here
[51:58] any brother adam's speaking here and he
[52:00] says
[52:01] he says
[52:02] uh angelic beans i love this he says
[52:04] about 60 some odd years after pentecost
[52:07] here he's sent his angel to signify
[52:10] things unto his servant john that must
[52:12] must shortly come to pass now when the
[52:14] book brother branham's speaking of john
[52:16] and the
[52:16] john in the book of revelations and he
[52:18] says he says it was wrote before the
[52:20] foundation of the worlds and he says
[52:22] angelic beings associate together oh i
[52:26] hope you get that that just dropped
[52:27] right down free
[52:29] he says look if you've got the holy
[52:31] spirit and if you've got the holy spirit
[52:34] in you
[52:35] then you're a candidate for
[52:38] association with the unseen world
[52:42] and the supernatural
[52:44] so if you've got the holy ghost brother
[52:45] branham says then you're a candidate to
[52:48] an association with an unseen world and
[52:51] to the supernatural he says no wonder
[52:53] people can't believe in those things
[52:55] they've never come in contact
[52:58] they've got nothing in here to believe
[53:01] with
[53:02] but when the holy spirit comes into the
[53:04] heart quickly he begins then a twofold
[53:07] being amen
[53:09] amen so now brother madam says when the
[53:11] holy spirit comes into the heart now
[53:14] he's a twofold two of you two persons
[53:17] he becomes a twofold being
[53:21] one of the earth to die
[53:23] and one in heaven to live
[53:26] in his body
[53:28] he is still subject to death
[53:31] but in his soul he's passed from death
[53:34] unto life
[53:35] in his body he has his earthly contact
[53:38] with his five senses
[53:40] in his spirit he has his contact with
[53:43] god through the holy ghost
[53:45] and the angels of god visits them and
[53:48] speaks with them and they are messengers
[53:50] sent from god to reveal and to bring
[53:53] messages from god to the individual
[53:57] amen so what do you become when you
[54:00] become born again with the holy ghost
[54:03] you're a candidate for angels to angelic
[54:07] godly angels
[54:08] to influence you to minister to you to
[54:11] teach you to lead you to guide you
[54:15] remember brother branham answers that
[54:17] question when they said what about an
[54:18] angel does an angel follow you
[54:20] and brother madam says absolutely
[54:22] doesn't the bible say that the angels of
[54:24] the lord encamp about them that fear him
[54:28] and brother venom begins to talk about a
[54:30] baby when it's born he says there's an
[54:32] angel there that's waiting for that life
[54:35] to give it breath that it becomes a
[54:37] living soul
[54:38] and he says and that angel is there
[54:40] remember brother branham says that there
[54:41] was always he said i should have served
[54:43] the lord he said i wish i would have
[54:45] came to the lord
[54:46] earlier sooner than he did and he says
[54:48] but a spirit hung over me remember
[54:53] so there's they remember remember this
[54:55] young people i'll just say it to all of
[54:57] us there's always before you're born of
[54:59] the spirit of god and after you're born
[55:02] of the spirit of god
[55:04] there's always two spirits trying to
[55:07] influence you
[55:09] there's a spirit if you're not born of
[55:11] the spirit of god and you're sitting
[55:13] here tonight unregenerated by the holy
[55:15] ghost and you're born how you were born
[55:17] into the world there's a spirit a demon
[55:20] angel spirit that has been assigned to
[55:23] you
[55:24] he knows all about you the devil studies
[55:26] you he knows your makeup he plays on
[55:28] your complexes he plays on your the
[55:31] things that you receive generationally
[55:33] by your parents he plays on your
[55:35] attitudes he and the devil will always
[55:38] be there to try to prevent you
[55:40] from receiving the holy ghost
[55:43] but there's also a spirit that follows
[55:45] you that's trying to encourage you and
[55:48] anoint your faith and bring you to the
[55:50] baptism of the holy ghost there's always
[55:53] a war going on
[55:54] it's which one are you going to
[55:56] surrender to
[55:59] he says and the angels of god visits
[56:00] them speaks with them they're messengers
[56:02] they bring messages to the individual
[56:04] he's out to get the first things first
[56:06] he says you can't put the cupola on
[56:08] before the foundation is laid so we got
[56:11] to remember that put things first seek
[56:13] ye first the kingdom of god we know
[56:17] brother branham says we know
[56:19] we make mistakes
[56:21] now he's speaking to a born-again
[56:23] believer here
[56:24] we know we make mistakes and it's funny
[56:27] to me because the same people who will
[56:29] teach that romans 7 is prior to being
[56:32] born again well do you know what if you
[56:34] are if you're suggesting
[56:36] that paul is saying that romans 7 at war
[56:39] and have this battle i'm carnal there's
[56:41] no good thing in me and and when i want
[56:43] to do right evil is present and and that
[56:46] i find then that the things that i want
[56:48] to do after the spirit i don't do and
[56:50] the things that i don't want to do i
[56:52] find myself doing
[56:54] if if someone wants to say that's prior
[56:56] to being born again then what you're
[56:59] saying is is that after you're born
[57:00] again you don't sin anymore
[57:04] you don't make mistakes anymore
[57:08] and it's funny how those people will
[57:10] only classify the big mistakes they
[57:12] forget that the sin is sin
[57:15] and pornography and pride is both sin
[57:18] and there's not either one of them
[57:20] that's any worse than the other
[57:23] right
[57:24] bitterness even unforgiveness jesus said
[57:27] if you don't forgive those your father
[57:29] in heaven can't even forgive you
[57:32] it's amazing how we classify and
[57:34] categorize sin
[57:36] jealousy is as sinful as meth as method
[57:40] or or marijuana or alcohol
[57:43] it's as sinful
[57:45] you hold on to unforgiveness someone did
[57:48] something to me you could be born of the
[57:49] spirit of god sitting in church but if
[57:51] you hold on and let a root of bitterness
[57:53] come into your heart
[57:55] and you can't forgive somebody who
[57:57] wronged you you're as in sin that's
[58:01] sinful
[58:02] as smoking a joint
[58:05] now i know legalists don't like to hear
[58:07] that but
[58:08] did not didn't paul say though i speak
[58:10] with the tongue of men and angels
[58:12] though i have prophecies though i have
[58:14] dreams and visions if i don't have
[58:16] charity all of those things mean
[58:20] zero well that's true
[58:24] so brother man says you meant so what is
[58:26] it it would have to be if you if you say
[58:28] it was romans 7 is speaking to someone
[58:30] who's prior to boring and then that
[58:31] means that you don't make mistakes that
[58:33] the war is over and there's no struggle
[58:35] and there's no battle well the problem
[58:37] with that teaching is it's not biblical
[58:40] and it's not according to the message
[58:44] so if you want to teach it that's fine
[58:47] but it's not according to what brother
[58:48] branham taught i'll stick with what
[58:50] brother and i'm talking
[58:52] he says we know we make mistakes but you
[58:54] mustn't look at that listen
[58:56] it's not your mistakes
[58:59] because you're always going to have them
[59:03] but you see it's following his rules
[59:06] following what he said to do stumble and
[59:10] falling doesn't have one thing to do
[59:13] with it
[59:15] a real true servant if he will stumble
[59:18] he will get up again
[59:21] hello
[59:22] if he wobbles god pulls him right back
[59:25] in the path as long as he's in the path
[59:28] of duty
[59:31] but if he's off the path of duty god's
[59:33] not even obligated to him but as long as
[59:36] he's in the path of duty god's obligated
[59:38] to him knowing that he's just a man or a
[59:41] woman he's obligated to that person as
[59:44] long as they're in the path of duty
[59:48] i love that
[59:49] so what would it mean it would have to
[59:51] mean this is this war this struggle that
[59:54] takes place
[59:55] even after you're born of the spirit of
[59:57] god let me just cut to the chase here
[1:00:00] friends because it's what's in my notes
[1:00:01] and what i'm preaching on
[1:00:03] it is it is essential it is absolutely
[1:00:07] essential to the believer
[1:00:09] that you are being changed
[1:00:12] not that you are changed not that you
[1:00:14] were changed but that you're continually
[1:00:16] changing
[1:00:19] change is so important to the christian
[1:00:22] and i know we don't people don't like
[1:00:24] change but god uses everything he
[1:00:26] changes things by seasons
[1:00:28] you have high times and low times
[1:00:31] you have good times and bad times you
[1:00:33] have times of mountain and times of
[1:00:35] valley you have times of victory and
[1:00:37] times of defeat and let me just say this
[1:00:40] way god has designed
[1:00:42] your life that way
[1:00:46] his design growth only comes through
[1:00:48] winter spring and summer it's got to go
[1:00:50] through death before life can come again
[1:00:53] so you you're always it's important that
[1:00:56] we're that we realize we understand the
[1:00:59] makeup of how we're made
[1:01:01] because if we understand ourselves we'll
[1:01:03] live in victory
[1:01:05] a lot more than we live in defeat
[1:01:08] amen amen because if satan can do
[1:01:11] anything if he'll come if he has victory
[1:01:13] over you he'll take a person who's born
[1:01:15] of the spirit of god has the baptism of
[1:01:17] the holy ghost and beat them up and bomb
[1:01:20] them with their mistakes and their
[1:01:22] faults and their failures and their
[1:01:23] shortcomings to a place to where they're
[1:01:25] defeated they have no faith they have no
[1:01:28] what they feel they have no authority to
[1:01:30] speak to the devil they have no
[1:01:31] authority to speak to their problems if
[1:01:34] he can back you up into a corner that's
[1:01:36] why brother branham says he has no
[1:01:38] weapon of his own except getting you to
[1:01:40] doubt your weapon and if satan could be
[1:01:43] accomplished any if satan can accomplish
[1:01:44] anything he'll beat the family of god up
[1:01:48] so much that they have no confidence
[1:01:50] to speak in jesus name
[1:01:53] [Music]
[1:01:55] but let me just tell you god doesn't
[1:01:56] look at your mistakes
[1:01:58] god doesn't look at your failures god
[1:02:01] doesn't even look at them that's what
[1:02:02] brother branham says he says god doesn't
[1:02:04] even see them
[1:02:06] he looks at your heart
[1:02:08] and he judges what's inside of you
[1:02:11] now we still believe in the baptism of
[1:02:14] the holy ghost
[1:02:15] we believe it in this church let me just
[1:02:16] stop here for a minute and say we still
[1:02:19] believe in altar calls
[1:02:22] we do we believe that in this church you
[1:02:23] say well where was that in the words
[1:02:25] that altar call in the bible well
[1:02:26] where's where's it where's a lot of the
[1:02:28] things that we that that you do here
[1:02:30] today you're not going to find an exact
[1:02:31] scripture in a verse an exact place
[1:02:33] where the new testament church they
[1:02:35] didn't have a sound system but we have a
[1:02:37] sound system they didn't have screens
[1:02:39] and technology but we used technology
[1:02:41] they didn't have the internet but we so
[1:02:43] the gospel through the internet
[1:02:46] what is an altar it's a place for you to
[1:02:48] does it does it save you no does baptism
[1:02:50] no it's not about an altar call that you
[1:02:53] come up to an altar and and you and you
[1:02:55] and you and then be by transferring
[1:02:57] because you went to the altar you're
[1:02:58] going to be born of the spirit of god no
[1:03:00] more than baptism but what what is what
[1:03:02] what what does it do then brother matt
[1:03:04] it's a public confession or something
[1:03:07] that you're doing publicly which the
[1:03:08] bible does teach if you confess me
[1:03:11] on earth i'll confess you before my
[1:03:13] father in
[1:03:14] heaven we still believe in the altar
[1:03:18] i don't believe we see it enough in our
[1:03:20] churches let me just
[1:03:21] preach by the inspiration of the holy
[1:03:23] spirit we don't see it enough anymore in
[1:03:25] our churches just speaking to my grandma
[1:03:27] here just yesterday yesterday or maybe
[1:03:29] the day before about this and we were
[1:03:31] just reminiscing about even brother
[1:03:33] caleb when and when brother caleb gave
[1:03:35] his heart to the lord and my grandma was
[1:03:36] reminiscing she said he was squalling
[1:03:38] and bawling like a baby
[1:03:40] but you know what god did something for
[1:03:42] him at the altar we don't see enough of
[1:03:44] that our young people don't come to
[1:03:46] altars anymore except for camp meetings
[1:03:48] except for young people except for youth
[1:03:50] camps
[1:03:51] it should be you know why they don't you
[1:03:54] do you wear them at well why aren't
[1:03:55] young people our old people are coming
[1:03:57] to the altar anymore
[1:04:00] so what are kids going to do they're
[1:04:02] going to follow with the example of
[1:04:03] parents and adults
[1:04:05] say brother matt why are you preaching
[1:04:07] on that because the lord told me to so
[1:04:08] i'm just going to
[1:04:10] we believe in the altar we should never
[1:04:12] get rid of the altar we believe in a
[1:04:14] place where you can make a confession
[1:04:16] where you can come up here and surrender
[1:04:18] your life whether it's for repentance or
[1:04:20] a renewing or restoration or bodily
[1:04:24] healing that you need in your body or
[1:04:25] your spirit or your mind
[1:04:28] we believe in shouting
[1:04:31] we believe in speaking in tongues
[1:04:34] it's what we believe in in this church
[1:04:35] we believe in those things
[1:04:37] we believe in dancing in the spirit we
[1:04:39] believe in healing of the body through
[1:04:41] the through the prayer of faith because
[1:04:43] the bible says the prayer of faith shall
[1:04:45] save shall heal the sick
[1:04:47] amen
[1:04:49] we believe in the laying on of hands
[1:04:52] because the bible tells us
[1:04:54] in the book of james
[1:04:56] what is james speaking of something you
[1:04:58] say brother
[1:04:59] he said anoint them with oil does the
[1:05:01] oil have anything is there any this is
[1:05:04] this is uh classic olive oil is this oil
[1:05:07] because it's sitting in this pulpit and
[1:05:09] because it's sitting in this church and
[1:05:10] because our pastor touched it does that
[1:05:12] somehow make it divine and if i could
[1:05:14] just take this and dump it a better knot
[1:05:16] my lid might not be tight if i could
[1:05:19] just dump it on myself that there's any
[1:05:21] kind of transferences there is in and of
[1:05:23] itself is there any value uh no but when
[1:05:26] you have when there's faith
[1:05:29] mixed with something physical
[1:05:32] why did jesus pick up mud and dirt and
[1:05:34] he spit into the dirt and he rubbed it
[1:05:36] together and then he rubbed it in the
[1:05:38] man's eyes and the eye the blinded eyes
[1:05:40] became open what was he what was jesus
[1:05:43] portraying that god cares about your
[1:05:45] physical condition and god could use
[1:05:48] something very natural and very physical
[1:05:50] if you'll have faith he'll honor that
[1:05:52] faith and virtue comes through it
[1:05:56] amen
[1:05:58] that's why we believe in anointing oil
[1:06:00] because the bible tells us to do that
[1:06:02] was there any is there significance in
[1:06:04] the oil it's representative of the oil
[1:06:07] of the holy spirit
[1:06:09] that's why baptism does it save it is
[1:06:11] there any value in the water if it's hot
[1:06:13] or if it's cold if it's clean if there's
[1:06:15] bleach or whatever it is there's no
[1:06:17] value in it but it's you doing something
[1:06:19] physically
[1:06:20] naturally and god honors that physical
[1:06:24] action he backs it up by his word
[1:06:28] that's why we believe in it
[1:06:33] why why why why do we believe we believe
[1:06:36] in the baptism of the holy spirit
[1:06:38] we believe in visions
[1:06:40] we believe in divine dreams
[1:06:43] we believe in prophecy and the
[1:06:44] fulfillment of prophecy
[1:06:48] that's what we believe you want a
[1:06:49] statement of faith there it is
[1:06:52] part of it
[1:06:56] why do we believe in these things
[1:06:57] brother matt because they're
[1:06:58] because there's a faith that's been
[1:07:01] restored to a church and we defend that
[1:07:06] faith
[1:07:07] hallelujah
[1:07:09] brother branham says here he says now he
[1:07:11] says he says that we don't let me just
[1:07:13] get back to my thought here for a moment
[1:07:15] so there's a part of that
[1:07:17] that that is always with you there's
[1:07:19] something inside even in your nature
[1:07:22] there's a war there's a struggle there's
[1:07:24] a battle always taking place and you've
[1:07:26] always got to be being changed
[1:07:32] there's something the lord does in our
[1:07:34] life and it's amazing because
[1:07:37] you have all these
[1:07:38] you have in this with the world the the
[1:07:41] world that we live in today and i
[1:07:42] perhaps it's maybe it's been that way
[1:07:43] for much longer than i've been alive
[1:07:46] but there's we see it i see it more than
[1:07:49] ever before you have counseling and
[1:07:51] there's books on counseling and
[1:07:53] christian counts and i believe in
[1:07:54] counseling counseling is very important
[1:07:56] it's a part large part of of what we
[1:07:58] what what we're doing even when we're
[1:08:00] ministering sometimes the words
[1:08:01] counseling to needs
[1:08:03] we believe in counsel but it's been
[1:08:04] there's all kinds of psychologists and
[1:08:07] you've got to go see a psychologist for
[1:08:09] this and for this mental condition you
[1:08:11] could only see this kind of a doctor and
[1:08:12] then he diagnoses that and then he
[1:08:14] writes you a prescription and gives you
[1:08:16] some kind of drugs and for some people
[1:08:18] outside of god delivering them that's
[1:08:20] what they need because god uses medicine
[1:08:22] we believe that
[1:08:24] hello
[1:08:26] we do believe in that
[1:08:28] and but but it's it's it's amazing
[1:08:30] because there's all kinds of councils
[1:08:33] and counselors and books on
[1:08:35] relationships and all kinds of manuals
[1:08:37] on how to do it right and how to raise
[1:08:39] children writing and how how to live it
[1:08:41] how to how to be successful and there's
[1:08:44] books on counseling on marriage and
[1:08:46] there's advice on just about any subject
[1:08:48] from marriage to physical exercise
[1:08:51] physical problems physical diseases uh
[1:08:54] child raising finances business
[1:08:57] all kinds of of of of counseling
[1:09:00] available and all kinds of experts who
[1:09:03] have degrees and are they're
[1:09:05] professionals and what they do yet
[1:09:08] yet we live in a world that is
[1:09:10] more divorced and more broken homes
[1:09:14] and more broken lives and depression and
[1:09:17] anxiety and and even in churches today
[1:09:20] divorce is a common thing married two
[1:09:23] three four times
[1:09:26] he said brother matty against preaching
[1:09:27] against christian counsel no no by by no
[1:09:30] means am i preaching against that but
[1:09:32] you say brother matt then what is the
[1:09:33] problem if there's so much counsel and
[1:09:36] there's so much help why aren't we being
[1:09:38] helped
[1:09:39] because no one's taking
[1:09:41] the counsel
[1:09:46] why does lives why would a lot why does
[1:09:49] christian lives not change
[1:09:52] when a life doesn't change it's because
[1:09:53] you're not taking the council
[1:09:56] right now
[1:09:57] how are you changed because you take the
[1:09:59] the council
[1:10:01] and when you take the counseling from
[1:10:03] the word of god your life can change
[1:10:06] tragically we spend so much time and we
[1:10:09] spend so much time praying for god to
[1:10:11] change our circumstances
[1:10:14] praying for god to change your business
[1:10:15] or your boss or to your wife and change
[1:10:18] my husband change my church if you'll
[1:10:20] change my pastor you'll change this lord
[1:10:22] if you'll change this about me when no
[1:10:25] one's no one's looking inwardly and
[1:10:27] saying maybe it's not what needs to be
[1:10:29] changed around me
[1:10:31] but maybe something needs to be changed
[1:10:34] inside of me
[1:10:38] being changed is when you can look down
[1:10:40] and say like david change my heart oh
[1:10:43] god
[1:10:45] don't just change change my
[1:10:47] circumstances but change
[1:10:50] me lord
[1:10:52] change the situation that's good god can
[1:10:54] do that sometimes
[1:10:56] but how many times does god before he
[1:10:58] can change that situation
[1:11:00] he's got to get you to change first
[1:11:04] change my sibling change my friend
[1:11:07] change this problem change this change
[1:11:09] this situation
[1:11:11] you see god the bible says the footsteps
[1:11:13] of the righteous are ordered of the lord
[1:11:14] so that means anything that happens
[1:11:16] whether it's a crisis in your life
[1:11:19] or some great difficulty god has
[1:11:21] orchestrated those parts of your life
[1:11:24] and there to bring change
[1:11:30] sometimes they're negative sometimes
[1:11:32] they're hard sometimes they're difficult
[1:11:36] but it's through difficulty
[1:11:38] that change can come
[1:11:41] sometimes it's very hard sometimes it's
[1:11:43] very difficult sometimes it's unfaceable
[1:11:46] and you can't even face it and you don't
[1:11:48] want to think about it
[1:11:50] but god's using that in that that
[1:11:52] circumstance that's so great to you and
[1:11:55] it's and he's trying to do a work down
[1:11:57] on the inside of you
[1:12:00] something that can change
[1:12:03] the inside of the inside
[1:12:06] something that can dig deep enough let
[1:12:08] me just look into some of these issues
[1:12:10] and some of these things that even that
[1:12:12] we're born with and we go through life
[1:12:15] even after we're born again of the of
[1:12:17] the spirit of god and we've came we've
[1:12:20] came to the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:12:22] but how many things do we bring over
[1:12:25] into our new
[1:12:26] creation life
[1:12:28] our new creation life because that's
[1:12:30] what the bible says you are when you're
[1:12:32] in christ you're a new
[1:12:34] creation old things
[1:12:37] are passed away
[1:12:40] behold
[1:12:41] come on somebody bible reader help me
[1:12:43] out here
[1:12:44] behold
[1:12:45] all things
[1:12:48] have became new
[1:12:51] that means you don't carry over
[1:12:54] your temper
[1:12:57] from the old creation
[1:12:59] to the new creation
[1:13:02] that means you don't carry over your
[1:13:04] bitterness that you had in your heart
[1:13:07] against what happened to you into the
[1:13:09] new creation
[1:13:11] or at least you shouldn't
[1:13:13] god should be able to change that but
[1:13:15] how many times have we carried things
[1:13:16] over and we live
[1:13:19] and we're fine and everything's kosher
[1:13:22] and we we pet it we don't want anybody
[1:13:24] to preach against it we don't want to
[1:13:25] have to touch it we don't want to have
[1:13:27] to confront it
[1:13:30] but you see god will take what god will
[1:13:31] do if you're son of god if you're a
[1:13:33] daughter of god god will change you
[1:13:37] if you want change yourself
[1:13:40] because the holy spirit will lead and
[1:13:42] guide you into all truth the holy ghost
[1:13:45] is constantly working on your character
[1:13:48] he's constantly working on your
[1:13:50] personality
[1:13:51] you say my personality absolutely the
[1:13:54] holy ghost is trying to change your
[1:13:56] personality oh but that's who i am
[1:13:58] that's that's my identity uh no friends
[1:14:01] my personality should be the person
[1:14:04] of jesus christ
[1:14:06] and so every day we live our personality
[1:14:09] should cha you say i don't want to
[1:14:10] change my personality i don't want to
[1:14:12] change who i am god does
[1:14:15] the holy spirit does
[1:14:17] when you're you realize when you look in
[1:14:18] the mirror and you see your reflection
[1:14:22] whether you like that or reflection or
[1:14:24] you don't like that reflection whether
[1:14:25] you like what you see you don't like
[1:14:27] what you see let me tell you something
[1:14:29] that's not you
[1:14:33] that's not who you are
[1:14:37] that's not who you are sometimes we
[1:14:39] become so chained to our
[1:14:41] our identity whether it's our roots the
[1:14:43] country we're from
[1:14:45] the family we were born in the family we
[1:14:47] were raised in the church that we go
[1:14:48] through we we we
[1:14:50] we we we get so how can i say it we get
[1:14:53] so prideful of us we don't even realize
[1:14:56] as a son or daughter of god the real you
[1:15:00] lives deep beyond that flesh that you
[1:15:02] see on the outside
[1:15:04] when the when when the worms have
[1:15:07] destroyed this flesh and the the skin
[1:15:09] worms
[1:15:11] has destroyed my skin and my hair falls
[1:15:13] out and my body begins to decay
[1:15:16] the real me is still living
[1:15:21] right
[1:15:22] so this isn't even me you're not even
[1:15:24] seeing the real me
[1:15:27] i've never seen the real me
[1:15:29] but one day the bible says we'll see him
[1:15:32] and it says when when when he doth
[1:15:34] appear we'll be in his very image
[1:15:40] so who are we holding on to
[1:15:43] and so you see your makeup even the
[1:15:45] things that you the things that you have
[1:15:47] in your life i want to go through this
[1:15:48] because we got a lot of quotes if you
[1:15:49] put up that first powerpoint i want you
[1:15:51] just to to follow along it's a lot to
[1:15:53] read but i believe it's important
[1:15:55] brother branham says here and let me
[1:15:57] just turn this clicker on and make sure
[1:15:58] i have control of that
[1:16:00] he says in zacchaeus
[1:16:02] the businessman if you went into a
[1:16:03] doctor's office and told him you were
[1:16:05] sick told him your symptoms and he was
[1:16:07] in a hurry he would probably give you a
[1:16:08] little prescription some anesthetic in
[1:16:10] it some sort of aspirin the doctor's
[1:16:12] merely trying to get rid of you just at
[1:16:15] that time because he hasn't time
[1:16:18] a real good doctor before he gives the
[1:16:21] medicine would diagnose the case
[1:16:25] thoroughly
[1:16:26] till he found out what was wrong
[1:16:29] then give you the medicine
[1:16:31] sometimes we find people going through
[1:16:33] these prayer lines out across the
[1:16:35] nations and they just run up and think
[1:16:37] that the lord ought to kill them right
[1:16:38] then
[1:16:41] but there's something maybe down in
[1:16:43] there
[1:16:44] and we set before the lord until he
[1:16:47] reveals that
[1:16:49] what that is
[1:16:51] there's something
[1:16:52] there's a reason
[1:16:55] for everything
[1:16:59] there's a
[1:17:00] reason for everything
[1:17:04] maybe prayers even something that you've
[1:17:06] prayed over why hasn't the lord answered
[1:17:08] that there's a reason
[1:17:11] for everything well i'm born of the
[1:17:12] spirit of god i've got the holy ghost
[1:17:14] but bitterness and unforgiveness
[1:17:18] and the lord can't even hear your prayer
[1:17:20] that you're praying
[1:17:23] amen
[1:17:26] if you hold on you hold on you say well
[1:17:28] brother matt what are we talking about
[1:17:29] very very practical very simple little
[1:17:31] things
[1:17:34] but there's a reason for everything
[1:17:37] you you have a temper and you you you've
[1:17:40] you've you've guarded you've you've met
[1:17:41] you've justified you've justified that
[1:17:44] temper you've justified that attitude
[1:17:47] problem that's not according to the
[1:17:48] scripture and you we we call ourselves
[1:17:51] christians well we we might be we call
[1:17:53] ourselves born of the spirit of god well
[1:17:55] you might be
[1:17:56] but hold on to that temper and the
[1:17:58] attitude and never let god correct that
[1:18:01] and it makes sense why certain things
[1:18:03] don't happen and come to pass in your
[1:18:04] life
[1:18:06] he says there's a reason for everything
[1:18:09] and you've got to find the reason first
[1:18:13] that's why it's so important
[1:18:16] that you never settle
[1:18:18] or you never get content
[1:18:20] with how your christian life as it
[1:18:22] stands right now
[1:18:24] brother you may have came through some
[1:18:26] amazing circumstances god may have
[1:18:28] brought you from the uttermost maybe
[1:18:31] even the gutter most and you might sit
[1:18:33] here tonight and you're thankful for how
[1:18:35] god's fire god has brought you but don't
[1:18:38] ever get content let me say it this way
[1:18:41] until you've got a new body and you're
[1:18:44] you've got a brand new body and your
[1:18:45] body's changed don't ever get content
[1:18:48] and don't ever stop saying let me be
[1:18:50] changed lord let me die to myself let me
[1:18:53] die to my mind what my thinking is
[1:18:56] i've got to constantly be being changed
[1:19:01] and i don't want to make excuses for any
[1:19:04] thing in my life
[1:19:07] he says then you can find what to work
[1:19:10] on
[1:19:12] i found someone not programming excuse
[1:19:14] me on the interviews this morning a
[1:19:15] person i guess they're still here in
[1:19:17] this building about speaking with
[1:19:18] tongues the person genuine person real
[1:19:20] person lived right they've heard me say
[1:19:22] the evidence of the holy ghost wasn't
[1:19:23] speaking in tongues and it isn't but i
[1:19:24] advise that person to ask god to let
[1:19:27] them either speak in tongues or prophesy
[1:19:31] hold on a minute brother branham now
[1:19:34] you just preached that speaking in
[1:19:36] tongues is not the evidence of the holy
[1:19:38] ghost but you've prayed for this person
[1:19:41] and actually advised that person
[1:19:44] to ask god
[1:19:46] to let them speak in tongues
[1:19:48] or prophesy
[1:19:50] why
[1:19:51] because
[1:19:53] it's the nature
[1:19:55] so this person who came to brother
[1:19:57] branham had was questioning whether they
[1:19:59] were born of the spirit of god and
[1:20:01] brother branham knew that they were born
[1:20:02] of the spirit of god but he knew that in
[1:20:04] their nature for whatever reason when we
[1:20:06] say in their nature
[1:20:08] it could be their upraising it could be
[1:20:11] the country they're from it could be
[1:20:13] what their pastor has preached it could
[1:20:14] have been the church that they were in
[1:20:15] maybe what their mom told them the kind
[1:20:17] of environment that they were and maybe
[1:20:19] everybody in their church was shouting
[1:20:21] and jumping and doing jericho marches
[1:20:23] and speaking in tongues
[1:20:25] and now this person is constantly living
[1:20:27] with a fear and a bad well i never did
[1:20:29] that and maybe and you think well
[1:20:30] brother madam wouldn't you just say whoa
[1:20:32] well my goodness sister tongues is no
[1:20:34] evidence of the holy ghost you just need
[1:20:36] to let that go
[1:20:37] you just need to cast that down
[1:20:40] brother branham knows that even though
[1:20:42] the sister is born again there's
[1:20:44] something in her nature that won't never
[1:20:46] settle
[1:20:49] until she speaks in tongues
[1:20:52] isn't it amazing that the prophet of god
[1:20:54] didn't just cut her off and and even if
[1:20:56] though that you don't need to look for
[1:20:58] that you should not about to be looking
[1:20:59] for signs but he says actually it's in
[1:21:01] her nature so i'm going to i tell you
[1:21:04] and advise you ask the lord that the
[1:21:06] lord will let you prophesy or speak in
[1:21:08] tongues
[1:21:10] you know what i did that i prayed i
[1:21:12] prayed that same prayer
[1:21:14] i prayed that same prayer and the lord
[1:21:16] years later wasn't right away wasn't
[1:21:18] instantly was completely unbeknownst to
[1:21:21] me in a prayer closet coming back from a
[1:21:23] missions trip and i spoke in tongues for
[1:21:25] two and a half hours
[1:21:28] spoke in tongues many times after that
[1:21:29] you say brother matt do you believe in
[1:21:31] tongues i do because it's biblical
[1:21:33] brother branham says i would that my
[1:21:35] entire church spoke in tongues
[1:21:37] now does that mean that if you don't
[1:21:39] speak in tongues oh there's something
[1:21:40] wrong no absolutely
[1:21:42] absolutely it's not the pray more than
[1:21:45] tongues but for an interpretation of
[1:21:47] those tongues
[1:21:48] a prophecy of those tongues is paul said
[1:21:51] if the unlearned come in and that they
[1:21:53] just hear an unknown tongue what does it
[1:21:55] edify except the person who's speaking
[1:21:58] and he says but if an interpretation
[1:21:59] comes forth then the unlearned would say
[1:22:02] god must be with them right
[1:22:04] i say that just you say brother matt why
[1:22:07] did you even say that i just mentioned
[1:22:08] that because because god knows your
[1:22:11] makeup and he knows what kind of person
[1:22:13] that you are
[1:22:14] even brother and when he speaks about
[1:22:16] the book of james lay your hands upon
[1:22:17] the sick and the brother says well
[1:22:19] brother adam isn't real gentile faith
[1:22:21] just to say speak the word like the
[1:22:22] roman centurion he says absolutely it is
[1:22:25] he says but god will meet you at
[1:22:27] whatever level of faith that you give
[1:22:28] him
[1:22:30] god will condemn sin he'll come down if
[1:22:32] that's what your faith needs he's not
[1:22:35] going to sit up there with his hands
[1:22:36] crossed amen
[1:22:38] he says because it's the nature the
[1:22:40] first thing he says uh i went to the
[1:22:43] person and found their birthplace
[1:22:46] and what sign they were born under
[1:22:49] and could tell what their birth was
[1:22:52] i went to their birthplace
[1:22:55] i went to their birthplace you mean but
[1:22:58] where you're born
[1:23:00] could have an effect on you after you're
[1:23:02] born of the spirit yes
[1:23:07] and sometimes those things of where
[1:23:09] we're born we need to let go of
[1:23:12] that's why we preach here all the time
[1:23:14] you're not a south carolinian you're not
[1:23:16] an american you're not a minnesotan
[1:23:20] you're not from idaho
[1:23:23] you're not from tennessee
[1:23:25] you're from a colony in heaven
[1:23:28] a civilization
[1:23:29] from a kingdom
[1:23:32] and so after abort after you're born
[1:23:34] again you've got to let go of your past
[1:23:36] you've got to let go of where the way
[1:23:38] that you were made up if it doesn't line
[1:23:40] up with the word of god
[1:23:42] and brother adam says the first thing i
[1:23:44] went to the person this is the person
[1:23:45] asking to speak in tongues do i have the
[1:23:47] holy ghost he says i advise you to pray
[1:23:49] that you speak in tongues he says the
[1:23:50] first thing i went to the person found
[1:23:51] the birthplace what sign they were born
[1:23:53] under and could tell what their birth
[1:23:54] was which way it's set in their natural
[1:23:58] nature sets them in a certain line
[1:24:01] he says then when they're born again
[1:24:04] they're over here
[1:24:06] in another nature
[1:24:09] amen
[1:24:10] right
[1:24:12] but brother matt does that mean that
[1:24:13] that old nature there in another nature
[1:24:15] and now that old nature is just that was
[1:24:17] a day of yesterday no that sticky carnal
[1:24:20] nature will be with you till you die
[1:24:25] and he says then when they're born again
[1:24:27] they're over here and then when you find
[1:24:29] into his nature that's the inside
[1:24:31] conscience
[1:24:33] inside conscience
[1:24:35] it's been one of the most amazing things
[1:24:38] that i have noticed along the lines of
[1:24:40] my ministry for our lord jesus
[1:24:42] is the peculiarity of people
[1:24:46] and the study of human life
[1:24:50] is one of the greatest things that a
[1:24:52] person can study
[1:24:55] to watch the nature of people
[1:24:59] you go to different parts listen to this
[1:25:01] he says you go to different parts of the
[1:25:02] nation
[1:25:03] and worlds to where you go you'll notice
[1:25:05] that there's a difference there's a
[1:25:06] different attitude that people take
[1:25:08] towards christ towards his service
[1:25:11] towards his servants towards worship and
[1:25:13] one of the things has been that one type
[1:25:15] of meeting will be just wonderful in one
[1:25:18] part of the country or it won't work in
[1:25:20] the other part of the country
[1:25:21] [Music]
[1:25:22] because people by nature now remember
[1:25:26] that's not their new nature and most so
[1:25:28] many times message believers will go
[1:25:30] well i'm just not from the south and i'm
[1:25:32] from up north and we're a little bit
[1:25:33] more cold and chilly and we don't we you
[1:25:35] know we're like the bereans and who are
[1:25:37] more noble than the thessalonicans
[1:25:39] because listen friends you're not a
[1:25:41] berean you're not a thessalonican you're
[1:25:43] not a no you're not from ohio you're not
[1:25:45] from the north you're not from the south
[1:25:47] that might have been your birth nature
[1:25:49] but when you come into christ all things
[1:25:52] are made new and now you're from the
[1:25:55] land of promise the land of the holy
[1:25:57] ghost
[1:25:58] and you say lord change me not into how
[1:26:01] they do it in the south not how they do
[1:26:02] it in the north change me of how they do
[1:26:05] it in the word of god
[1:26:06] let my life be a mirror image of that
[1:26:09] lord is that what we want
[1:26:11] oh is that what we want church to say we
[1:26:13] want a body a church
[1:26:15] we're not we're not denomination we're
[1:26:17] not this name we're not that name
[1:26:19] we're we follow another ordinance we
[1:26:21] have another order we have another law
[1:26:24] that we live by
[1:26:28] and he says he says here now listen he
[1:26:30] goes further and i'm going to run out of
[1:26:31] time let me just go through this 20th
[1:26:33] century prophet listen to him talking to
[1:26:35] his sister excuse me sister i have to
[1:26:37] rally i've relaxed my mind once in a
[1:26:38] while now we'll be strangers i see that
[1:26:40] you're strictly a stranger to me you're
[1:26:41] from away from here come from another
[1:26:42] city you've got a lot of trouble in your
[1:26:44] heart you've got heart trouble to begin
[1:26:45] with is that right whole lot of
[1:26:46] blackness i see a black sheep keep
[1:26:48] following you and brother man says oh
[1:26:50] it's a lie
[1:26:51] somebody's total eye on you now she's
[1:26:53] having heart trouble
[1:26:55] and now brother branham goes into her
[1:26:57] not her body he doesn't diagnose her
[1:26:59] heart
[1:27:00] that a doctor with a heart cath could do
[1:27:03] that they could go in there and look at
[1:27:05] the natural heart
[1:27:06] but brother adam goes further than that
[1:27:08] and says that the the reason you're
[1:27:10] having an outside
[1:27:12] natural reaction your nervousness your
[1:27:15] high blood pressure your your heart
[1:27:17] problem it's actually not anything to do
[1:27:19] with the body
[1:27:21] but the body's just responding to an
[1:27:23] issue that you have in your spirit
[1:27:27] that's why brother madam says there's a
[1:27:28] reason for everything
[1:27:31] and so he starts to go down her look
[1:27:33] into her life and say oh it's a lie
[1:27:36] somebody's told a lie on you
[1:27:38] that was a man that was professing
[1:27:39] divine healing he said you was a witch
[1:27:42] yes you could hear the woman in 20
[1:27:44] century prophet she begins to weep
[1:27:47] is that true and you've got a whole
[1:27:48] story in your church something another
[1:27:49] about is that right you're pastor sick
[1:27:51] right now he's got polio is that right
[1:27:52] yes sir sister don't pay no attention to
[1:27:55] what them people tell you they're lying
[1:27:58] and the only thing wrong with your heart
[1:27:59] is that nervous condition got your heart
[1:28:01] worked up go home in peace and god bless
[1:28:04] you you're all right god bless you
[1:28:07] you're not a witch
[1:28:08] what did he do there was no kind of
[1:28:10] supernatural tongue spoken over her he
[1:28:13] simply diagnosed the problem in her
[1:28:15] natural flesh and when the enemy was
[1:28:18] exposed
[1:28:20] she was free
[1:28:23] because what brings freedom exposing the
[1:28:25] devil
[1:28:26] when you can expose him in your nature
[1:28:28] and in your life and say that's not me
[1:28:30] that's not who i am
[1:28:32] freedom comes to a believer all you got
[1:28:35] to do is expose the enemy
[1:28:38] listen he says you believe with all your
[1:28:40] heart believe god will heal you of that
[1:28:42] tb believe he will make you well
[1:28:45] if i'd ask him lord jesus i pray you'll
[1:28:46] heal the woman makes you get completely
[1:28:48] whole i ask the blessing in jesus
[1:28:49] christ's name amen go on your road
[1:28:51] rejoicing saying thank you lord and you
[1:28:53] will get well and then strangely listen
[1:28:55] he says
[1:28:57] he's you know this that was the end of
[1:28:59] that quote there that that last one
[1:29:00] listen to my brother man says and he
[1:29:01] care to you care do you he he cares do
[1:29:03] you care and then strangely sorry for
[1:29:05] the words just if you can't see them too
[1:29:07] well i have some of the other ones
[1:29:08] larger i think strangely i went to a
[1:29:10] place where i made an odd turn instead
[1:29:12] of turning around i went to make a turn
[1:29:14] the lights flashed on a lovely couple on
[1:29:15] the outside two fun two fine young
[1:29:18] ladies that i had just married two fine
[1:29:20] young ministers and satan after seeing
[1:29:23] the minister one of them his ministry
[1:29:25] being set and he took a life's companion
[1:29:28] right there this altar they went he's
[1:29:30] trying to be careful to not give away
[1:29:32] who that is he's just he's he's covering
[1:29:34] their identity but he's telling you
[1:29:35] about a problem that this brother had
[1:29:37] and he says that just married them this
[1:29:39] after they went away happily on their
[1:29:40] honeymoon and the enemy jumped on this
[1:29:43] young man
[1:29:45] and i'm saying this to express what i'm
[1:29:48] saying does he care
[1:29:50] somehow with faith that would not take
[1:29:53] no
[1:29:54] they turned and returned back here
[1:29:57] knowing after they was all the way over
[1:30:00] and way in the east here somewhere on
[1:30:02] their honeymoon returned back and i was
[1:30:04] sitting waiting and i walked in fine
[1:30:07] handsome young man his wife sitting on
[1:30:08] the outside crying her little companion
[1:30:10] of the man of the other brother come
[1:30:11] running which is a friend of this young
[1:30:12] man saying brother branham such and such
[1:30:14] has happened went there and seen this
[1:30:16] handsome young man sitting there just in
[1:30:17] the peak of his life leader young men
[1:30:18] sitting there and satan bound him
[1:30:21] he never noticed but i took my hand left
[1:30:24] to shake his hand right to see if some
[1:30:27] disease had plagued him but there was no
[1:30:29] sign of vibration
[1:30:31] coming right out of the room from
[1:30:32] praying
[1:30:33] and fasting and waiting on the lord the
[1:30:35] anointing of the holy spirit was there
[1:30:37] and that's why it led us
[1:30:39] see
[1:30:40] and then seeing the shadow of darkness
[1:30:43] over him i never said what i was doing
[1:30:45] but in less than a couple moments time
[1:30:48] it was all gone the coldness of his
[1:30:51] hands left he was shouted in praising
[1:30:53] god
[1:30:54] a few minutes
[1:30:56] to find himself
[1:31:00] and here they sit right here this
[1:31:03] morning
[1:31:04] sitting in the audience see how satan
[1:31:07] was trying to upset that young man by
[1:31:10] referring to him of some complex to be
[1:31:13] built
[1:31:14] back which the holy spirit knew and i
[1:31:18] seen it by the vision of the lord
[1:31:21] so what does brother branham say he says
[1:31:23] here's this man goes this honeymoon and
[1:31:24] then enemy jumps on him and you say well
[1:31:27] what happened well brother branham
[1:31:28] reveals it right there in the church
[1:31:29] service he says that old complex and
[1:31:32] it's something in his mind
[1:31:34] that he had long let go of tried to jump
[1:31:37] back on him
[1:31:39] something from his nature something from
[1:31:41] his mind
[1:31:43] and brother branham says god showed it
[1:31:45] by vision the holy spirit i've seen it
[1:31:47] by a vision of the lord but god cared
[1:31:49] for that i love that
[1:31:51] but god cared for that man
[1:31:54] god cared for that young boy
[1:31:59] he cared enough not to just let that man
[1:32:01] but what was it something in his nature
[1:32:04] was affecting him now a minister had
[1:32:06] already let go of that but the devil has
[1:32:09] a way of digging up your past the devil
[1:32:12] has a way and you've committed it to god
[1:32:14] and you might have prayed and committed
[1:32:16] it to god but you've constantly got to
[1:32:18] be washing your mind you've constantly
[1:32:20] got to be bringing every thought that is
[1:32:23] contrary to the word of god subject to
[1:32:25] the holy spirit that's why the bible
[1:32:27] says the weapons of our warfare are not
[1:32:29] carnal but they're spiritual to the
[1:32:32] tearing down of strongholds
[1:32:37] and it says take captive take every
[1:32:40] thought that's contrary to the word of
[1:32:42] god take it prisoner
[1:32:46] and he says god cared for that
[1:32:48] young boy just coming in a few moments
[1:32:50] ago a lady
[1:32:52] my house at 8 27. wow
[1:32:55] just coming in a few moments ago a lady
[1:32:57] sitting here in the aisle no just got
[1:32:59] her a seat and somebody sat down she
[1:33:00] said nine years brother random i've
[1:33:01] tried to get a hold of you she said i'm
[1:33:03] so desperate i hear late i couldn't even
[1:33:05] get a prayer call the lady moved back
[1:33:07] prayer card let me move back said
[1:33:08] brother branham just a word with you
[1:33:09] standing there a vision broke over this
[1:33:11] fine young fine looking young woman and
[1:33:14] see that her heart was burdened and she
[1:33:16] was trying to work to make a living and
[1:33:19] a great thing happened now brother madam
[1:33:20] can't give the details but he's given
[1:33:22] you enough to let you know
[1:33:24] it was something naturally
[1:33:28] that was affecting her spiritually
[1:33:33] and he says something had happened way
[1:33:35] back in the time listen way back in the
[1:33:37] time
[1:33:38] of her parents
[1:33:42] that it caused this great thing to
[1:33:44] happen to her
[1:33:46] and the lord jesus revealed it showed
[1:33:48] what it was and there in a moment's time
[1:33:50] took it from the woman
[1:33:53] she went around rejoicing and now
[1:33:55] sitting here in the audience with us now
[1:33:57] rejoicing with tears as she's wiping her
[1:34:00] eyes knowing the truth of the thing was
[1:34:01] made known and that poor little neurotic
[1:34:04] woman that was nervous she didn't know
[1:34:05] what to do with herself thinking she was
[1:34:07] gone and there was no holy spirit and
[1:34:08] this is her and this is her last day she
[1:34:11] had tried for nine years she was about
[1:34:12] to be at the end of despair god cared
[1:34:15] for that little woman
[1:34:16] which no one cares for
[1:34:19] see what a time
[1:34:21] he does care
[1:34:25] don't ever let the devil lie to you and
[1:34:27] tell you that that god doesn't care i
[1:34:29] was just talking to me and rachel
[1:34:30] talking the other day about the story
[1:34:32] brother brandon the the fish who
[1:34:35] the the the the lure had went so deep in
[1:34:38] in his in his belly and ripped the guts
[1:34:40] out and and there's the fish laying
[1:34:41] there on the top of the water floating
[1:34:42] for a half hour brother adam says there
[1:34:44] and he says there the holy spirit came
[1:34:47] to me voice spoke to me and said speak
[1:34:48] to that little fish give him back his
[1:34:50] life
[1:34:52] and brother man says here in my pocket
[1:34:54] he said stuffed in my pocket was the
[1:34:56] prayers i think it was little children
[1:34:57] with polio he said i had those prayer
[1:34:59] requests i had been holding needing to
[1:35:00] pray for he said of serious conditions
[1:35:03] if maybe it wasn't children it was
[1:35:04] someone with with a grace and multiple
[1:35:06] great sicknesses
[1:35:07] and he says yet the lord with all of
[1:35:10] these great needs wants me to speak to
[1:35:12] that little fish that little
[1:35:14] insignificant brim brother man says why
[1:35:16] did he do that just to show you
[1:35:19] he cares about the little things
[1:35:24] glory
[1:35:27] god cared for that little woman which no
[1:35:29] one cares for what a time he does care
[1:35:31] when he was here on earth i say he cared
[1:35:34] for the people
[1:35:35] so much
[1:35:36] until he healed their sick
[1:35:38] comforted their hearts
[1:35:40] told them about a place where he would
[1:35:42] go and prepare for them and would come
[1:35:43] again to receive them he cared for them
[1:35:45] and notice he cared so much until when
[1:35:47] he knowed he must leave in order to
[1:35:48] bring this to bring this great thing to
[1:35:50] us he said i'll not leave you
[1:35:51] comfortless i'll send the holy spirit
[1:35:53] and he shall continue my care
[1:35:56] for you
[1:35:57] until he until he returns there's no one
[1:36:01] cares
[1:36:02] like jesus
[1:36:05] and knowing that he sent back the holy
[1:36:07] spirit to continue to comfort his people
[1:36:11] does he care
[1:36:12] certainly he cares
[1:36:14] now he was to continue care for the
[1:36:16] people his people here on earth in the
[1:36:19] same manner that he cared for them when
[1:36:21] he was here
[1:36:26] brother brandon begins to relate and i'm
[1:36:27] just going to move through this quickly
[1:36:30] but i'm just going to relate some of
[1:36:31] this story here and then we'll skip some
[1:36:33] of it
[1:36:34] he begins to relate a dream and we've
[1:36:36] read this here before and preaching the
[1:36:37] entire message on it we're not going to
[1:36:38] go that direction but i just want to
[1:36:40] show you something
[1:36:41] prophet of god begins to tell of this
[1:36:43] dream
[1:36:44] and he says and he's speaking here
[1:36:46] he says one night the lord woke him up
[1:36:49] morning we're sitting there here and i
[1:36:50] looked it's brother roy and he says i
[1:36:53] looked there in jerusalem lords
[1:36:54] communion table i was talking his
[1:36:55] brother roy has a dream he couldn't
[1:36:56] understand it but lori's sitting present
[1:36:58] looking at me right now he saw it he
[1:36:59] called me up in houston or out in
[1:37:01] arizona sent me a letter and i called
[1:37:04] him back said you were sitting there
[1:37:05] brother brandon this is his dream you
[1:37:06] were sitting there brother branham and i
[1:37:08] saw that big pillar like come in and get
[1:37:10] you and take you away from the lord's
[1:37:11] table and you went westward because he
[1:37:13] was sitting on the east side watching me
[1:37:14] go west that's like coming and taking me
[1:37:16] out said it was one morning like it was
[1:37:18] a vision got up in the bed about three
[1:37:20] or four o'clock in the morning and
[1:37:22] something like that and saw this happen
[1:37:24] and he screamed looked like for days
[1:37:26] brother bill come back and roy and i
[1:37:27] have been real brothers we live together
[1:37:29] hunt together we're just brothers and he
[1:37:30] screamed for me till he was hoarse in
[1:37:32] his throat come back bring him back
[1:37:34] bring him back here come that pillar of
[1:37:35] fire coming back or a cloud come back
[1:37:37] and he set me at the head of the table
[1:37:39] notice
[1:37:40] and i had been changed
[1:37:43] i had been changed
[1:37:45] it was a mystery to brother roy me being
[1:37:48] changed
[1:37:49] to look different
[1:37:51] i lay this up here for something i want
[1:37:53] to remember
[1:37:54] and brother adam takes a note
[1:37:56] and he lays it there in front of the on
[1:37:58] the top of the pulpit big letters being
[1:38:00] changed
[1:38:03] and he says when i give him the
[1:38:05] interpretation of it that's funny if you
[1:38:07] don't read the rest of this you got to
[1:38:08] be wondering what's brother branham
[1:38:10] talking about he's been changed has he
[1:38:12] got his body change is he in a new body
[1:38:14] is a theophany body this must be some
[1:38:17] ethereal something's about he's going
[1:38:19] west there must be something about
[1:38:20] brother breaking up the seals and oh
[1:38:22] he's changed and maybe it's that white
[1:38:24] you know they you you could call it a a
[1:38:26] million different things notice what
[1:38:27] brother bannon begins to say that change
[1:38:29] was
[1:38:30] i'm going to skip two of these here he
[1:38:32] says i had been preaching for years and
[1:38:34] i've become an old man an old veteran
[1:38:36] preacher had a lot of hard battles maybe
[1:38:38] i'm scarred and cut up on the inside
[1:38:40] from fights because my law the lord gave
[1:38:42] me was not to not back to kiss the
[1:38:44] babies and men marry the young and to
[1:38:46] bury the old but it was to hold a
[1:38:48] two-handed sword at the battlefront
[1:38:51] against the wiles of paganism and
[1:38:52] demonology and all the powers of
[1:38:54] darkness and fight it with the word of
[1:38:56] god till i seen the enemy defeated and
[1:38:58] he says i've been cut many times
[1:39:02] so he begins to relate something in his
[1:39:04] nature
[1:39:05] this is something in his flesh
[1:39:07] this is something he's born of the
[1:39:09] spirit of god he's filled with the holy
[1:39:10] ghost he's preaching the gospel
[1:39:13] but he says something in my nature i've
[1:39:16] been cut many times
[1:39:18] let's skip through
[1:39:20] a lot of these we'll just skip through
[1:39:21] them just to save time get to the
[1:39:23] important context of it
[1:39:25] he says and these rickey's this is just
[1:39:27] through this he says and these rickeys
[1:39:29] and raketas that have so sassed the word
[1:39:32] called them ricky and raketa
[1:39:35] god give me to understand
[1:39:38] i shouldn't do that
[1:39:44] god gave me to understand
[1:39:47] i shouldn't do that now
[1:39:50] you got to be careful with what you take
[1:39:52] even listening to the tapes and listen
[1:39:54] and what brother branham's saying when
[1:39:56] he even relates as if you're not careful
[1:39:58] you'll take those tapes of brother
[1:39:59] branham saying a bunch of rickeys and
[1:40:01] raketas and then we think as message
[1:40:03] believers that ought to be our attitude
[1:40:05] oh these just bunch of heathen and bunch
[1:40:07] you ain't got the holy ghost and you
[1:40:09] ain't born again and you don't even have
[1:40:10] the spirit of god what ought our nature
[1:40:12] to be
[1:40:15] brother adam says the lord had showed me
[1:40:18] i shouldn't do that
[1:40:21] because that's many of them are still
[1:40:23] his children
[1:40:27] they can't help because they act so much
[1:40:30] different isn't it amazing
[1:40:32] that the lord
[1:40:33] cared
[1:40:35] about his attitude
[1:40:37] towards people
[1:40:41] and you don't think he cares
[1:40:44] about our attitude
[1:40:46] towards people
[1:40:50] how about we go further than just the
[1:40:52] people on the outside what about the
[1:40:53] people on the inside
[1:40:55] you don't think the lord cares how we
[1:40:57] treat each other
[1:41:00] oh he does
[1:41:02] he cares how not just the minister
[1:41:04] standing behind the pulpit how he treats
[1:41:06] i got a great responsibility here lord
[1:41:08] hold me accountable for my attitude that
[1:41:10] i have towards you
[1:41:12] because you're the purchase of his blood
[1:41:13] the bride of jesus christ but let me go
[1:41:15] further than that god cares how you
[1:41:17] treat each other
[1:41:20] he cares about your attitudes that you
[1:41:22] have one towards another
[1:41:25] let's just move a little bit further
[1:41:26] husband he cares about how you treat
[1:41:29] your wife
[1:41:31] he cares about your attitude towards
[1:41:34] your husband
[1:41:36] children young people he cares about how
[1:41:38] you treat your parents
[1:41:40] parents he cares about how you treat
[1:41:43] your children and the attitudes
[1:41:46] and how you look at them and how you
[1:41:47] view them and how you speak to them amen
[1:41:52] can we go on
[1:41:54] good i'm glad luther agreed we can go on
[1:41:56] berluther i heard an amen right over the
[1:41:58] internet thank you brother
[1:42:02] he says they can't help it because they
[1:42:04] act so much different some of these old
[1:42:06] cold formal churches has got them that
[1:42:08] spirit upon them they're in much in
[1:42:10] prison as israel was in prison just as
[1:42:12] much as moses went down to deliver them
[1:42:14] from slavery human beings that love
[1:42:16] jesus christ would serve him if they
[1:42:19] only knew what to serve him by and
[1:42:21] they're in bondage under
[1:42:23] denominationalism that tells them don't
[1:42:25] you do this and don't you do that
[1:42:27] but the call of god must come whoever
[1:42:30] wants to march towards the promised land
[1:42:32] let him march we're on our road to that
[1:42:35] promised land amen let them come march
[1:42:38] we're on our road to meet christ at the
[1:42:40] end time and i wanted to bring this to
[1:42:43] you so that you would see and show you
[1:42:46] that the mistake that a man can make
[1:42:49] being sincere
[1:42:52] moses lost the feeling of his people
[1:42:54] because they wouldn't listen brother roy
[1:42:56] you see your dream and now i can't go
[1:42:58] with a ministry like that until i feel
[1:43:01] different in my heart about it no matter
[1:43:03] if god did tell me but that is that
[1:43:06] change
[1:43:09] you mean it wasn't some ethereal thing
[1:43:11] and his body changed
[1:43:13] it's theophany it was all about the
[1:43:15] opening of the seals no
[1:43:16] it was about an attitude problem
[1:43:19] that he had towards unbelieving
[1:43:22] non-message believing people people who
[1:43:24] were in denominations who didn't believe
[1:43:26] him
[1:43:27] and if god cared his how much he would
[1:43:29] care about his attitude towards them
[1:43:32] how much more he'd care about how we
[1:43:33] treat our spouses and our children and
[1:43:36] our pastor and the deacons and the sound
[1:43:38] guys and how the sound guys treat the
[1:43:40] sound guys how the musicians treat each
[1:43:42] other how you treat each other how i
[1:43:44] look at you how i speak to you how i
[1:43:46] talk to you
[1:43:47] say brother man does that mean we could
[1:43:49] never make a mistake no we'll get upset
[1:43:51] we'll get we'll get mad at each other
[1:43:53] we're not we got a sticky nature i may
[1:43:55] rub you the wrong way you may rub me
[1:43:57] that wrong way but i say god changed me
[1:43:59] to where i can repent and i can humble
[1:44:01] myself and say brother will you forgive
[1:44:03] me sister will you forgive me i'm sorry
[1:44:06] i didn't mean to act that way i care
[1:44:08] about you the lord cares about you
[1:44:10] and he cares about how we treat each
[1:44:13] other
[1:44:14] [Music]
[1:44:16] this is the change brother roy had seen
[1:44:18] him brother branham something in his
[1:44:20] heart had changed he says that brother
[1:44:23] roy that's what something's got to
[1:44:25] change me
[1:44:26] because i in my heart if i go out there
[1:44:28] feeling the way i do now i still feel
[1:44:29] that they ought to have heard the
[1:44:30] message they ought to have done it and i
[1:44:32] don't have the feeling for people that i
[1:44:34] should have until i get that feeling
[1:44:37] there's no need of me going
[1:44:39] because i'd be a hypocrite
[1:44:41] you know that you until you get the
[1:44:43] feeling for that person who you or you
[1:44:46] may be concerned about their sin you may
[1:44:49] be upset by their condition you may be
[1:44:50] upset by what that what they're doing
[1:44:52] and your reputation and your image and
[1:44:54] how it makes you look and but listen
[1:44:56] until you can care for that person
[1:45:00] you ought not even say anything to them
[1:45:03] because you can't help them
[1:45:07] well hey
[1:45:09] man
[1:45:12] until we can have the right attitude how
[1:45:14] could we ever minister to someone who
[1:45:17] needs ministering you could be so right
[1:45:20] and you could be 100 percent right about
[1:45:23] how you're viewing the situation
[1:45:25] but if you you could be a hundred
[1:45:27] percent right
[1:45:28] but if you've got the wrong attitude
[1:45:30] you're 100 percent wrong
[1:45:34] i say that to me i say that to brother
[1:45:36] matt so you receive it too
[1:45:38] but i say it to me brother matt until
[1:45:40] your attitude is right
[1:45:42] how can you help someone
[1:45:45] until you can care like jesus cared
[1:45:48] amen
[1:45:53] i just want to make sure i get some all
[1:45:55] of this what was important yes he says
[1:45:57] and then it might have been
[1:45:58] he says it might be
[1:46:00] he says and then it might have been this
[1:46:02] that i've tried to think of it this
