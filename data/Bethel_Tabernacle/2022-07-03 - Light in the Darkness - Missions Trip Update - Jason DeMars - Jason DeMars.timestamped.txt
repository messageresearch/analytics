[3:14] even though i'm leaving this afternoon
[3:16] for
[3:17] byc it's good to be back for a little
[3:19] bit wish i was back for longer
[3:22] let's uh let's stand up and pray
[3:28] heavenly father we just come before you
[3:29] now lord and we want your name to be
[3:31] lifted up and glorified lord you're
[3:33] doing a
[3:34] mighty work on this earth lord
[3:37] to find that last predestinated seed and
[3:40] to
[3:41] bring each one of those seed to the
[3:43] place of perfection lord and maturity
[3:46] ready for the rapture lord
[3:48] lord our desires just to be a part of
[3:49] that
[3:51] to walk and live in submission to you
[3:53] for your glory we ask these things in
[3:55] jesus name
[3:56] amen god bless you can be seated
[4:02] this thing working
[4:05] all right
[4:09] so we wanted to start out with reading a
[4:12] few quotes for brother branham i was uh
[4:16] sometimes it gets discouraging when
[4:18] you're doing missions in
[4:20] amongst muslims
[4:22] and you see my goodness well
[4:24] you know you go to africa and there's
[4:26] great huge results and your
[4:28] things are constantly flowing and you go
[4:30] to the middle east and you're like
[4:32] this is a little boring
[4:35] but
[4:36] but
[4:37] there's a reason for that
[4:39] you see what brother branham said and
[4:41] actually i
[4:42] i knew he said it in the church ages
[4:44] book as i began to
[4:46] search about this
[4:47] he says it quite a number of times in
[4:49] quite a number of different ways
[4:51] and refers to this story it had a great
[4:54] impact in his mind
[4:57] and brother branham says and so i met
[4:58] one missionary he said think of it
[5:00] brother branham i've been here 30 years
[5:03] and i got one precious jewel
[5:05] i said what's that i want a
[5:07] to christianity
[5:09] that's really something for a missionary
[5:11] to win a to christianity
[5:14] amen it really is something
[5:19] and then in el shaddai brother ben says
[5:21] the lord willing hope to be in south
[5:23] africa this year with brother david and
[5:25] another big campaign or i think that the
[5:28] queen campaign and that i ever held for
[5:30] the lord was there
[5:32] where 30 000 raw heathens accepted jesus
[5:35] christ his personal savior one afternoon
[5:38] thirty thousand
[5:40] tagged raw heathens blanket natives and
[5:42] never had heard
[5:43] the name of jesus before as far as i
[5:46] know
[5:47] now there wasn't all natives some of
[5:49] them they claimed about ten thousand
[5:52] mohammedans see was in that group my
[5:58] now talking to a missionary years ago
[6:00] and he was talking about that one
[6:01] precious jewel he'd been in the missions
[6:03] field for so many years and had won one
[6:05] muhammadin
[6:06] they're the hardest there there is to
[6:09] win
[6:10] because they're from the old medes of
[6:12] persian that alter not
[6:14] and their religion is tops and they say
[6:15] it's the best and you just can't change
[6:17] them but when you see where i think
[6:19] we've made our mistake
[6:21] we haven't did as jesus commanded us to
[6:23] do see
[6:25] see we've went and made churches and had
[6:26] denominations and at schools
[6:29] that's all right but jesus never exactly
[6:31] commissioned his church to do that it
[6:33] was to preach the gospel seal see heal
[6:36] the sick raise the dead cleanse the
[6:37] lepers that's the commission see
[6:39] and we've done other things besides that
[6:41] and that's the reason the gospel hasn't
[6:43] gone out the way it has
[6:45] back to the general orders brethren
[6:46] that's right back to the order
[6:49] and so looking at these things that
[6:52] brother branham is speaking about here
[6:55] is a very true statement and
[6:56] historically very accurate through
[6:59] history so if you're familiar at all
[7:01] with history islam
[7:03] came in the seventh century
[7:06] and began to spread through uh saudi the
[7:09] the arabian tribes
[7:11] in through northern africa and then and
[7:14] then it went uh
[7:16] east
[7:18] going towards india
[7:20] and so
[7:21] you know different places had different
[7:24] uh
[7:24] ways that they received it but basically
[7:26] they it all it came to each of these
[7:28] places by the edge of the sword and by
[7:31] force
[7:33] and so that's that's kind of beside the
[7:34] point but it's also part of the part of
[7:37] the whole picture is that
[7:38] each of these areas
[7:40] through the force of an army became
[7:44] muslims
[7:46] and so
[7:48] islam is a very much a political
[7:50] religion
[7:52] it's not a separation of church and
[7:54] state you know
[7:56] that would be a natural understanding
[7:58] for most christians that are bible
[8:01] believers maybe not catholics but
[8:03] that are bible believers so
[8:05] we see
[8:06] our faith
[8:07] and the government as as something that
[8:10] the government shouldn't be trying to
[8:13] press pass over here to keep away
[8:15] though people of faith can be involved
[8:17] in in government and
[8:19] you know we should vote in different
[8:21] things and be involved in in the world
[8:22] that we live in
[8:24] but not a part of it and so
[8:26] the that's important but in islam
[8:28] there's not a divide like that and so
[8:32] and any political problems that we've
[8:34] faced and wars we've faced in islamic
[8:36] countries is because of this
[8:38] two worlds are colliding that don't look
[8:42] at the situation exactly the same
[8:44] when a muslim looks at
[8:47] an american he says that he's a
[8:48] christian
[8:49] an american looks at an american he says
[8:52] i mean he might be a christian but he's
[8:53] probably not
[8:55] more than likely
[8:57] right so there's there's a big
[8:59] difference and and then the mind of even
[9:01] an evangelical
[9:03] christian they they view those things as
[9:06] separate and they see those things that
[9:07] separate
[9:08] to a muslim
[9:10] their religion is equally political as
[9:13] as it is a religion
[9:15] and so government
[9:17] government's job
[9:19] in the mind of islam is to enforce
[9:24] islam and block anything else from going
[9:27] there
[9:28] so if that that's basically the that's
[9:30] the heartbeat
[9:32] of islam
[9:34] so a missionary goes there he's not only
[9:38] a religious threat he's a political
[9:40] threat
[9:42] and that's the reason why it's not a
[9:44] simple thing number one is
[9:46] you go through history i don't you can't
[9:49] think of many
[9:50] islamic missionaries that literally
[9:52] survived
[9:54] doing what they did because it's not
[9:56] possible it doesn't happen now brother
[9:58] branham's talking about a missionary to
[10:00] muslims in south africa and
[10:03] that being
[10:04] very much a minority
[10:06] of people
[10:07] that are muslims in south africa and the
[10:10] government at that time being controlled
[10:12] by
[10:13] i think it was the dutch
[10:14] uh the afrikaans
[10:16] so reaching out to muslims was no issue
[10:18] and no problem and in fact you would
[10:20] probably be defended
[10:22] by the government
[10:23] if a muslim were to raise up and come
[10:26] against
[10:27] that said missionary so again the
[10:29] situation is quite different
[10:31] there in south africa and nevertheless
[10:33] they could only win one
[10:35] over 30 years brother branham there in
[10:37] the in in his meeting put jesus christ
[10:40] on display
[10:42] and putting jesus christ on display to
[10:44] them they saw something real they saw
[10:47] the life of christ in action that was
[10:49] quite different than trying to teach
[10:50] them theology they have they have ev the
[10:54] islam is literally set up step by step
[10:57] to
[10:58] combat the theology of christianity
[11:01] number one is
[11:03] they believe that christians are
[11:04] polytheists
[11:06] they believe in three gods
[11:07] father son and holy ghost they
[11:09] three persons there's three gods so a
[11:12] that's that setup there b
[11:14] the bible is corrupt the the the new
[11:17] testament is corrupted you can't trust
[11:19] it so quote to a muslim
[11:22] that that the bible from the new
[11:23] testament they say well
[11:25] the gospel of jesus is correct but you
[11:28] have
[11:29] the false gospel
[11:31] yours is wrong
[11:32] well jesus died on the cross for your
[11:34] sins no
[11:36] he didn't die on the cross he was
[11:38] replaced by judas
[11:40] and jesus
[11:41] went away and fled and was caught up to
[11:43] god but judas
[11:45] they god deceived the people they
[11:48] thought they were killing jesus but they
[11:49] were killing judas
[11:50] and so you go step by step g well jesus
[11:53] is this is the virgin born son of god
[11:54] they say sure he's virgin born and he
[11:57] was sinless and he was a prophet and
[11:58] he's the messiah
[12:00] but he's not the son of god that's
[12:01] blasphemy so you see islam you don't
[12:04] just come and preach islam and they say
[12:06] i don't know anything about jesus
[12:08] say we believe in jesus he's a prophet
[12:10] he's the messiah he's coming back again
[12:13] to rule over the world
[12:15] so
[12:16] what's what do you what what what's
[12:18] different here a lot
[12:21] a huge amount is different
[12:23] the whole picture is different
[12:25] but they have something there they have
[12:27] theology
[12:29] that they know very well
[12:30] and
[12:32] if if a muslim knows anything about god
[12:34] they know he's one and they know these
[12:36] tenets to battle against christianity so
[12:39] the minute you go and just preach
[12:41] theology to them
[12:46] they're not interested
[12:47] they're not interested especially in
[12:50] um especially in states that are uh
[12:54] under the sunni religion
[12:56] and i'll share a minute the reason for
[12:59] that but
[13:01] under sunni islam
[13:02] all of these places have come to the
[13:05] point where you cannot be if you're
[13:07] turkish it means you're muslim
[13:09] if you're not a muslim
[13:12] you can't be turkish
[13:14] and they they have a whole tribal thing
[13:17] that's behind that that you literally
[13:20] you better just run if you become a
[13:22] christian just go you can't stay there
[13:24] you can't be around your family
[13:26] because
[13:28] rule number one if you have someone that
[13:30] converts
[13:31] in
[13:32] islam in your family you should kill
[13:34] them
[13:36] that's rule number one every everyone
[13:38] knows that you're bringing a shame on
[13:40] our family and you're bringing a shame
[13:42] on the tribe and if they don't kill them
[13:44] the tribe will come after that family to
[13:47] kill them
[13:48] so there's a whole thing that's whether
[13:50] that's be afghanistan egypt
[13:54] turkey saudi arabia
[13:56] pakistan etc you'll find that
[13:59] if you study and look that's exactly
[14:01] what happens not only will they
[14:03] typically kill the person who is
[14:04] converted they will track down the
[14:06] person that led them to christ and seek
[14:08] to kill them
[14:11] that's just how it works that's their
[14:13] that's their process every
[14:15] the the devil has trained them all
[14:17] extremely well they know this this is
[14:19] how they operate this is how they act
[14:22] and nobody questions that
[14:24] at all but
[14:27] but brother branham talks about the the
[14:29] persians
[14:30] they have a different background
[14:32] now
[14:33] uh they're they're called they're under
[14:35] the uh
[14:36] sect of islam called shia
[14:40] and the sunni
[14:42] uh they consider shia to be heretics
[14:46] and the reason for that is because they
[14:48] have
[14:49] they they believe in saints so their
[14:52] their mullahs are like
[14:54] people that they can somewhat pray to
[14:57] they believe that uh that one of the the
[15:00] 12th imam from
[15:02] a thousand years ago
[15:04] he he
[15:06] died but then resurrected
[15:08] and that he's invisibly working
[15:11] in the world now
[15:13] and that one day he will return again
[15:16] with jesus to set up
[15:18] the muslim
[15:20] kingdom on earth so that's that's what
[15:22] that's considered a
[15:23] twelver
[15:25] shia islam
[15:27] and that's what they believe and that's
[15:28] the state religion inside of iran
[15:32] and so
[15:33] because iranians have
[15:35] a rich history
[15:38] and it's been very well preserved a lot
[15:40] of these other countries their history
[15:41] is there but not preserved and not very
[15:44] well known for them their history
[15:46] started with islam
[15:48] and so
[15:49] beyond that they're not sure what
[15:51] happened
[15:52] you know minus perhaps egypt
[15:55] would be different but
[15:57] in in their minds in their minds islam
[16:00] is
[16:02] also their nationality
[16:04] directly connected to their nationality
[16:06] but with iranians for some reason
[16:08] it's not so
[16:10] they believe that they can be iranians
[16:12] and be
[16:13] muslims zaro austrians baha'i
[16:16] christian and it doesn't impact on
[16:19] whether they're still
[16:20] iranians and their their families
[16:25] this is not across the board because if
[16:27] they're they're a part of the twelver
[16:29] cult that controls the country
[16:31] they do act like other countries but the
[16:33] average person in the populace doesn't
[16:37] so in fact the conditions are such
[16:40] that if someone becomes a christian in
[16:42] iran
[16:44] they're often looked at as you're very
[16:46] brave
[16:47] almost heroic in a sense
[16:49] by their family and those around them
[16:51] they might be nervous
[16:53] for sure they'll be nervous what's going
[16:54] to happen because
[16:55] if you
[16:57] you know in in america
[16:59] your id does it say what religion is on
[17:01] it
[17:03] no if you go get a job do they say what
[17:06] religion are you from
[17:10] no
[17:11] in fact they're not allowed to do that
[17:13] here
[17:14] but in iran
[17:15] your id says your religion if you're
[17:17] born a muslim you can't become a
[17:20] christian
[17:21] right so you in other words you can't
[17:23] change your identification
[17:25] and your your name would reflect an
[17:27] islam
[17:29] 99 of the time would reflect an islamic
[17:31] name
[17:32] in the persian language so you have you
[17:35] have iranians who
[17:37] become christians now they go to apply
[17:39] for a job and now they have to say am i
[17:41] going to deny
[17:42] the son of man before men
[17:45] in order to get a job or am i going to
[17:48] be be honest and truthful and declare
[17:51] that i'm a christian
[17:53] and they they're honest and truthful
[17:55] they declare that they're a christian
[17:56] and they don't have a job
[17:59] and then they go to another place and
[18:00] they don't have a job and this is very
[18:02] typical or they say well i have to live
[18:05] i have to eat so let me just lie about
[18:06] this
[18:08] which is a good situat both situations
[18:10] are terrible
[18:12] and impossible so you're you're just to
[18:14] live just to function just to buy a
[18:16] vehicle just to do anything in iran
[18:19] you have that problem but nevertheless
[18:22] with that being said is people are
[18:24] coming to christ in iran
[18:26] now again thank the lord
[18:29] definitely again but that's different
[18:32] than being born again of the spirit of
[18:33] god
[18:34] because you have to understand
[18:37] life is miserable in iran and has been
[18:40] miserable in iran why has it been
[18:42] miserable in iran because of the twelver
[18:45] cult that controls the country
[18:47] it's a religion
[18:49] so the people's hatred for their
[18:51] government
[18:52] equals hatred for what
[18:55] islam
[18:56] so
[18:57] everybody has
[18:59] satellite television there
[19:01] and
[19:03] all there's all kinds of ministries that
[19:05] are putting satellite television into
[19:09] into iran
[19:10] and
[19:11] millions
[19:12] of iranians are coming to christ
[19:15] i haven't heard lately what it is but
[19:17] it's
[19:18] as far as in the world
[19:21] people coming to christ
[19:23] there's nowhere that's experiencing more
[19:26] growth in christianity than inside of
[19:28] iran
[19:30] it's not even close
[19:31] it's exponent it's almost exponential
[19:35] and the government has a great fear and
[19:36] they go to great lengths to try to
[19:38] prevent that
[19:41] gasoline on the fire and again i'm i'm
[19:44] telling you that probably the majority
[19:46] of these conversions are simply
[19:49] someone saying i am sick of islam i want
[19:52] to be a christian
[19:53] that's not being born again
[19:55] at all
[19:56] i i thank the lord i'm glad they're
[19:59] they're changing their religion that's a
[20:01] good thing
[20:02] and yet
[20:03] that's not
[20:04] that's not a real birth and that's what
[20:07] we're experiencing and seeing amongst
[20:09] iranians in turkey
[20:11] when when we get there and uh meet with
[20:14] them
[20:15] that's the first thing that we do is
[20:17] begin to declare the gospel
[20:19] serpent seed the purpose of the blood of
[20:21] christ and that's what myself the
[20:23] brothers that we're working with
[20:25] are doing
[20:26] constantly and consistently because
[20:28] that's that's the great need is to get
[20:30] people really get people to christ like
[20:32] brother branham said i'm afraid in our
[20:34] churches we're not getting people to
[20:35] christ
[20:36] we're not getting them to a true
[20:38] transform transformative
[20:40] conversion
[20:41] and so this is the situation
[20:43] that we're facing the lord is moving
[20:45] amongst iranians it's
[20:47] what brother branham's talking about
[20:49] here definitely what i'm seeing and
[20:52] amongst turkish people
[20:54] you know we've witnessed the turkish
[20:55] people shared the gospel with turkish
[20:56] people myself the team
[20:58] and when they've accepted the gospel
[21:01] it's not within weeks it's within weeks
[21:03] that they vanish we've never hear from
[21:05] them again
[21:06] and you try to track them down and maybe
[21:09] it's somebody you see one of these
[21:10] brothers they see in the city all the
[21:12] time all of a sudden they're gone
[21:14] so
[21:15] we don't know what's happening to them
[21:17] we really have no clue whether they're
[21:18] leaving the country or
[21:20] getting
[21:22] killed we have no idea
[21:25] so that's the situation amongst sunni
[21:27] turkish people but with iranians it's
[21:29] it's another thing and they're
[21:31] sharing the gospel with them they're
[21:33] immediately ready to receive it and
[21:35] accept it but that's again it's
[21:37] different than really having an
[21:39] experience of god that leads you into
[21:41] all truth has to start there right
[21:45] but i can't stop there
[21:46] and i'm
[21:48] i've got five minutes left and i haven't
[21:50] even showed
[21:51] any of the pictures
[21:53] i'll go fast so um i started out my trip
[21:57] went went to
[21:59] kaiseri met up with brother nehemiah in
[22:01] the airport in istanbul we went to city
[22:04] of chrysler where we held ministers
[22:05] meetings there
[22:07] and
[22:08] held
[22:09] two services each day and there was
[22:11] three of us ministering there
[22:13] this is the uh i'm changing it on my
[22:15] ipad not up there you can't see that
[22:20] there's the flight from
[22:21] charleston over to kaiseri
[22:25] yeah oh my is right
[22:27] still feeling it
[22:29] there's a group of believers that met us
[22:30] in the hotel to greet us and brought us
[22:32] flowers
[22:34] it's always weird um
[22:40] uh but wonderful to see them and
[22:42] been been a long time
[22:45] that's the big mountain there in the
[22:47] city of kaiser mount ergies
[22:52] it's the
[22:53] old city wall this was
[22:55] uh it's called kaiseri because it was
[22:57] originally originally under the roman
[22:59] empire
[23:00] not caesarea philippi not that but
[23:02] another another town named after
[23:04] caesarea
[23:06] after the caesar so
[23:08] it's the old city wall i think those are
[23:10] like
[23:11] a couple thousand years old
[23:15] some of the brothers there
[23:20] um
[23:24] i preached on the marriage of the lamb
[23:26] with them and the seventh seal
[23:28] and then i preached on overcoming
[23:30] depression in the minister's meeting
[23:34] the believers the local believers in the
[23:36] church were also allowed to come to the
[23:39] services
[23:40] as well
[23:42] any time you have an iranian service
[23:44] after the service you have to go into
[23:46] the fellowship area
[23:48] and drink
[23:49] tea it's required
[23:54] some of the food there
[23:56] brother brad you got to come with me and
[23:57] experience it
[24:00] kebabs is the main thing you eat in
[24:02] turkey it's we're spoiled
[24:04] for sure
[24:08] there with brother nehemiah is the bald
[24:09] one there he's the one i've been working
[24:11] with since
[24:12] 2009 before he even left iran and then
[24:15] brother shaheen
[24:16] is the one on the same side of the table
[24:18] with me he's the pastor in the city of
[24:19] denisley
[24:22] brother o'mead is on the far left he's
[24:25] the pastor in kaiseri
[24:27] he's
[24:29] he's had his we've prayed for him in the
[24:31] past he's the one that's had his refugee
[24:33] case canceled
[24:35] there and was in danger of deportation
[24:38] brother nehemiah goes to a church in in
[24:41] toronto area that was able to sponsor
[24:43] him and so uh within the next i think in
[24:47] the month of august he'll be
[24:49] going
[24:50] to canada with his family
[24:56] so that's his wife
[24:57] there
[24:59] on the right side
[25:00] sister sana's
[25:05] then i flew from kaiseri back to
[25:07] istanbul actually and then to cairo
[25:10] and we handed out book four five and six
[25:13] of supernatural series to group of
[25:16] believers there
[25:18] ministered on the coming of the son of
[25:20] man to them
[25:21] and the marriage of the lamb
[25:29] that's brother megaly the pastor there
[25:35] they do church a little differently they
[25:36] they um
[25:39] they have children's church while the
[25:40] adults are having church the children
[25:42] have church
[25:43] so there's like it's it's so funny
[25:45] there's
[25:46] the families are just huge so
[25:48] in the church you have like
[25:50] spread out maybe 25 30 people then
[25:53] outside you have like 60 kids running
[25:56] around
[26:10] so um
[26:11] i got a testimony this is how it usually
[26:13] happens in
[26:14] in egypt as i get all the testimonies
[26:17] from the last trip
[26:19] when i come back on this trip and one of
[26:20] the brothers came up and told me he'd
[26:22] been
[26:23] suffering from
[26:25] chronic back pain
[26:27] kind of
[26:28] must have been sciatica because the way
[26:30] he's describing it and
[26:32] had that for years and the last triple
[26:34] zero was that september
[26:36] we had a prayer line and he came in it
[26:38] and
[26:39] that the lord healed him of that he
[26:40] hasn't suffered
[26:42] from it since
[26:45] then i went up to norway i'm just going
[26:46] to go quickly because this this was
[26:50] that looks like northern minnesota
[26:52] it was it was incredible to see how
[26:55] how similar it was
[26:57] and how the similar the people talked
[26:59] you guys make fun of us the way we talk
[27:01] but
[27:02] now i know why
[27:05] so food is so similar to what i grew up
[27:07] with
[27:08] i had to laugh when they brought out the
[27:10] food because i was like yeah my mom made
[27:11] that exact meal
[27:14] all kinds of scandinavians in minnesota
[27:18] and no that's not raw that's smoked
[27:20] salmon
[27:24] there's some of the pictures going
[27:26] across the fjord
[27:28] and brother in the middle is brother
[27:30] kittle kittleson i think
[27:32] some people know about him um i might
[27:36] post his testimony he he actually from
[27:38] uh
[27:39] he played i think bass guitar in a death
[27:42] metal band
[27:45] back in the 80s and 90s late late 80s
[27:48] early 90s and
[27:50] was
[27:51] witnessed to by a guy brought to a bible
[27:54] study in his town that brother perry
[27:55] johansen was leading and
[27:58] and
[27:59] didn't want to go but was basically
[28:01] dragged there
[28:02] and came in with long hair and
[28:05] earrings and couldn't
[28:07] finish a sentence without swearing
[28:10] and
[28:11] the lord really
[28:12] touched his life
[28:14] completely changed it completely
[28:16] delivered him he quit the metal band and
[28:19] and uh he's married now he's got a
[28:21] couple sets of twins he's a wonderful
[28:23] brother and then on the far right is
[28:25] brother sven
[28:27] eric peterson
[28:29] and he's a pastor in sarpsberg
[28:31] really fine brother
[28:34] some more pictures of the beautiful
[28:35] countryside and i think that's
[28:38] about it oh there's uh that's brother
[28:40] john hanson he's the assistant pastor
[28:43] there in the church in
[28:45] strange pronunciation it's spelled skeen
[28:48] s-k-i-e-n this is how it's pronounced
[28:51] show on
[28:54] i don't know how they got that but
[28:56] they did and i had a wonderful time of
[28:58] fellowship there and
[29:00] and uh brother pair johansson
[29:02] is the pastor he's 87 years old and he
[29:06] came to the message in
[29:07] 1968
[29:09] so i believe brother
[29:11] jason and brother matt have been there
[29:13] and ministered for their
[29:16] immediate annual meetings in youth camp
[29:19] and um i think that's where brother
[29:20] jason met
[29:22] brother abraham
[29:24] for the first time so amen let's stand
[29:27] and pray
[29:33] gracious father we come to you now lord
[29:35] and we're so thankful for your mercy and
