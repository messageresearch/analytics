[1:09:20] inspiration just settled upon this
[1:09:22] weekend and God would just turn many
[1:09:25] hearts into Joy now my my little clicker
[1:09:28] here is not working brother so are we
[1:09:30] plugged in up there it'll make it easier
[1:09:33] for all of us if we
[1:09:35] can
[1:09:37] tonight God's just going to go to the
[1:09:39] heart of the
[1:09:40] matter we can talk a lot about all the
[1:09:43] things around the issues or the symptoms
[1:09:46] and we can go through all of that as
[1:09:48] young people but we've spoken uh the
[1:09:51] brothers have spoken wonderfully
[1:09:54] and uh it seems like restoration is a
[1:09:57] theme and tonight we'd like to speak
[1:10:00] about restoration of the booths and many
[1:10:03] might not maybe understand that or might
[1:10:06] not have heard it like this before and
[1:10:08] that's why we're speaking on it and uh
[1:10:11] it's a private place it's a personal
[1:10:13] place that maybe for years has been
[1:10:16] neglected or lost but God is going to
[1:10:18] speak on it tonight for us and uh going
[1:10:21] to the next slide I can see the brothers
[1:10:23] are going to have to help me now I I
[1:10:26] understand this is a youth meeting this
[1:10:28] is Young people's
[1:10:29] weekend but uh we're going to be
[1:10:31] speaking about spiritual things and I'm
[1:10:34] asking everyone to be spiritually minded
[1:10:36] and to be mature I believe the young
[1:10:38] people the message are ready for the
[1:10:41] third
[1:10:42] pool I believe that uh it's time now for
[1:10:45] all of us to realize what's happening in
[1:10:47] our lives spiritually is beyond our
[1:10:50] flesh it's beyond just someone trying to
[1:10:53] maneu things or orchestrate it uh who in
[1:10:56] this room's ever had a birthday
[1:11:00] before you have some of you haven't but
[1:11:04] who's had a birthday before all right
[1:11:07] what we're speaking about tonight has
[1:11:09] happened then for each one of us and
[1:11:12] it's happened to a mother to a lady and
[1:11:15] that's why we're here that's
[1:11:17] naturally and so spiritually though
[1:11:21] there's contractions and there's things
[1:11:23] that are have been going on in your life
[1:11:26] and especially in the last months and
[1:11:28] brother John's just going to labor in
[1:11:30] this area to help you understand that
[1:11:33] it's the Holy Spirit on you it's been
[1:11:35] his thirst and his uh groaning and his
[1:11:39] spirit and I know that there's many that
[1:11:41] are streaming I I heard today from some
[1:11:44] of your parents some of your
[1:11:45] grandparents even from other countries
[1:11:48] that are um as we said last night when
[1:11:51] Joel prophesied and talked about your
[1:11:53] children children and children we're
[1:11:55] seeing that manifested right in this
[1:11:57] weekend brother Burley brother Cadre
[1:11:59] brother Jason brother Matthew we're
[1:12:01] seeing the word of God made manifested
[1:12:04] so in our next slide I wanted you to
[1:12:06] know that it's the Lord
[1:12:09] Jesus that is in control of this surgery
[1:12:13] how many can see that on the screen it's
[1:12:16] the Lord Jesus is just watching every
[1:12:18] word he's he's uh pre-arranged
[1:12:21] everything he's allowed things to happen
[1:12:24] for this
[1:12:26] moment and when it comes time for the
[1:12:29] birth nothing's going to stop
[1:12:32] it when it comes time for it to happen
[1:12:36] nothing can stop it so tonight I want
[1:12:38] you just to visualize in your heart it's
[1:12:41] just like um everyone has come
[1:12:45] around and we're just standing here like
[1:12:47] this we're just standing as uh nurses or

[1:13:18] been
[1:13:19] right this is the
[1:13:22] night this is the hour let's stand to
[1:13:25] our feet and turn to our scripture the
[1:13:27] brothers can turn to the scripture in
[1:13:30] John chapter
[1:13:37] 16 John chapter 16 is the
[1:13:46] scripture we're taking these two
[1:13:51] thoughts of spiritual
[1:13:54] contractions in your booth
[1:13:59] because it's something that is happening
[1:14:03] globally but right here tonight in your
[1:14:06] life and to us this day this scripture
[1:14:10] is fulfilled right in our midst John
[1:14:14] chapter 16 verse 20 Jesus is
[1:14:17] speaking in in my Bible the words of
[1:14:20] Jesus are read and so this the whole
[1:14:23] scripture tonight is Jesus speaking to
[1:14:26] the young
[1:14:27] people speaking to us speaking to the
[1:14:30] bride John 16 verse 20 verily verily I
[1:14:35] say unto you that ye shall
[1:14:39] weep and
[1:14:41] lament but the world shall
[1:14:45] rejoice and ye shall be
[1:14:49] sorrowful but your sorrow shall be
[1:14:52] turned into
[1:14:54] Joy
[1:14:56] Hallelujah a woman when she is in
[1:14:59] travail we know that a woman is a type
[1:15:02] of the church or the bride a woman when
[1:15:05] she is in travail has
[1:15:07] sorrow because her hour is
[1:15:11] come but as soon as she is delivered of
[1:15:14] the child she
[1:15:16] rememberthe
[1:15:18] anguish for joy that a man is born into
[1:15:23] the world are you thinking spiritually
[1:15:26] right now this this child that is being
[1:15:29] born is
[1:15:31] Christ and Jesus is just laying it right
[1:15:34] out there uh more than just a drama but
[1:15:36] he's making it real that while we're
[1:15:39] going through this time of travail and
[1:15:41] sorrow because our hour is
[1:15:45] come but as soon as a woman is delivered
[1:15:49] of this
[1:15:52] child she remember no more the anguish
[1:15:55] it's Isaiah said when we are on that
[1:15:58] other side that none of this will be
[1:16:01] remembered or even come into our
[1:16:04] minds nothing negative nothing outside
[1:16:08] of God's plan will even be able to be in
[1:16:11] the bride's mind throughout the
[1:16:13] Millennium and throughout our future
[1:16:16] home can we say thank you Jesus no no
[1:16:19] bad thoughts no memories of any it will
[1:16:22] not even be remembered or come into your
[1:16:24] mind all the anguish and trouble verse
[1:16:28] 22 and ye now therefore have
[1:16:33] sorrow but I will see you again Jesus
[1:16:37] speaking and your heart shall rejoice
[1:16:39] and your joy no man taketh from you
[1:16:44] verse 23 is our last verse and in that
[1:16:48] day you shall ask me nothing verily
[1:16:51] verily I say unto you whatsoever you
[1:16:54] shall ask the father in my
[1:16:58] name he'll think about it
[1:17:02] maybe how many believe that day is this

[1:20:12] to connect yes we do with young people
[1:20:15] but it's got to go beyond the now it's
[1:20:17] got to stretch into the eternity where
[1:20:20] lives can be changed forever am where
[1:20:23] this
[1:20:25] groaning where this something that can't
[1:20:27] even be uttered many times from our
[1:20:31] hearts and I'm going to come down into
[1:20:32] your personal life but God is raising up
[1:20:35] an army tonight and this spiritual
[1:20:39] contractions that you've been sensing
[1:20:41] now and they're getting stronger
[1:20:44] contractions are like cramps is
[1:20:47] everybody ready to go into the service
[1:20:48] now what spiritual contractions
[1:20:51] contractions are
[1:20:53] cramps there's
[1:20:56] spasms it's something that's
[1:20:58] uncontrollable that's happening in your
[1:21:01] life and they get closer as the time
[1:21:04] approaches they get closer and it's
[1:21:07] often associated with
[1:21:10] pain it's not just always running and
[1:21:14] joyful and happy but a travail and a
[1:21:17] sorrow contractions are like there's
[1:21:20] discomfort it's not easy
[1:21:23] when you speak about the new birth or
[1:21:26] new life and every Birth has them every
[1:21:30] single one of you caused pain when you
[1:21:34] came forth so a contraction is actually
[1:21:38] can you go like this with your hands
[1:21:39] it's a it's a tightening then it's a
[1:21:43] flexing then it's something that's
[1:21:45] moving like this and I want you to
[1:21:47] listen really closely spiritual
[1:21:50] contractions it's a normal part of
[1:21:53] pregnancy it's something that is
[1:21:55] happening brother brandham said it like
[1:21:56] this in birth pains that it takes
[1:21:59] pain it takes
[1:22:02] distress and it takes
[1:22:05] discomfort so the gospel isn't always
[1:22:08] easy it's not always running on the
[1:22:12] mountains we're on the Mountaintop this
[1:22:14] weekend this is the greatest times of
[1:22:17] our lives are weekends like this but
[1:22:20] we've got to leave on Sunday afternoon
[1:22:23] or Monday and go down into the valley
[1:22:26] but it's the valley that he restores our
[1:22:30] souls no fruit is growing on the
[1:22:33] Mountaintop any farmer anybody will tell
[1:22:36] you that that raises weed or raises
[1:22:39] crops that it's down in the in the
[1:22:42] fertile Valley where it grows and so you
[1:22:45] cannot remain on the
[1:22:47] mountain we don't want to take away your
[1:22:49] Mountaintop experience and I'm not here
[1:22:51] to to to water that down but I'm here to
[1:22:56] let you know that what is happening this
[1:22:59] contractions and this flexing and
[1:23:01] cramping that you've been going through
[1:23:04] in the end of all of that these muscle
[1:23:07] contractions are what will help you in
[1:23:11] the labor to push that baby down the
[1:23:16] birth Channel and
[1:23:18] out so the very pain and the Very spasms
[1:23:22] and and there can be false contractions
[1:23:24] and there can be you that are in the
[1:23:26] back you sisters are streaming that's
[1:23:28] had children know that there can be
[1:23:30] false contractions and Braxton Hicks
[1:23:32] they call it and they just things that
[1:23:34] happen and you're just bracing you're
[1:23:36] bracing and you're but it just goes it's
[1:23:38] a false but then there's times when it
[1:23:40] just builds up and and it builds up and
[1:23:42] you're able to that's what I was
[1:23:44] speaking about last night just
[1:23:46] Brea okay just breathe and then it's
[1:23:50] like something in a bit you can just
[1:23:51] feel the pressure pressure you can feel
[1:23:54] the pain it's trying to move you into a
[1:23:57] place you say oh this is bad and this
[1:23:59] isn't this is uncomfortable but I'm here
[1:24:01] to tell you tonight that the very thing
[1:24:04] that has caused this contractions in
[1:24:06] your spiritual life is going to help you
[1:24:08] in the
[1:24:09] labor you needed that to push the baby
[1:24:13] out the birth to
[1:24:15] now and to push it
[1:24:18] out because we've had too many stillborn
[1:24:21] children in the message or as our
[1:24:24] brother that sang the special sang for
[1:24:26] many years he said it was just he was
[1:24:28] around the message raised in the message
[1:24:30] but there has to come a time when all of
[1:24:33] this becomes
[1:24:35] real
[1:24:37] sir in John chapter 16 that we read
[1:24:40] Jesus said a woman in travail has sorrow
[1:24:44] maybe the brothers can put up John
[1:24:46] chapter 16 again verse
[1:24:50] 21 a woman in travail has
[1:24:54] sorrow but there is
[1:24:57] Joy at the
[1:24:59] birth there's joy when you see a young
[1:25:03] lady singing a song for the glory of God
[1:25:06] and some of you are just waiting yeah we
[1:25:08] know her we know what happened in the
[1:25:10] cabin or yeah we know that brother and
[1:25:12] we kind of Snicker a little bit but do
[1:25:14] you know God is actually doing something
[1:25:17] Supernatural even in this atmosphere
[1:25:19] tonight right now you can feel it's
[1:25:21] different that's that contraction that's
[1:25:23] the all the prayers that's all the God
[1:25:26] has dates circled on his calendar for
[1:25:29] there to be births for there to be
[1:25:31] healings for I I was listening to
[1:25:33] brother brandham just coming in in our
[1:25:35] room I'm just forgetting the message
[1:25:37] maybe it was uh about Samson uh what was
[1:25:41] that message brother
[1:25:43] Burley just once more and brother
[1:25:45] brandham said oh I love this he said God
[1:25:48] is giving you back your right mind he's
[1:25:51] giving you back your mind and as Samson
[1:25:54] was his eyes were out but he was moving
[1:25:56] there God was giving back his right mind
[1:25:59] and I thought God do that for our young
[1:26:01] people tonight restore him to
[1:26:07] them give them the mind of
[1:26:11] Christ you say my heart is is broken or
[1:26:15] my heart is Wayward or my my heart is
[1:26:18] just brother John I don't even have the
[1:26:20] desire for God the Bible speaks about a
[1:26:23] person like that and it says I will give
[1:26:25] you a new heart I will give you a new
[1:26:28] spirit and I will put my spirit in you
[1:26:31] boy that would be wonderful tonight if
[1:26:33] someone within this service God had
[1:26:36] tonight's date circled on his calendar
[1:26:39] that this was the whole burden the whole
[1:26:44] focus of
[1:26:47] everything was for these
[1:26:49] moments wouldn't that be wonderful and
[1:26:51] we could just s that that a child is
[1:26:53] being born there there's and we just
[1:26:56] know that there's going to be joy and we
[1:26:59] know that there's going to be
[1:27:00] deliverance we know that we're going to
[1:27:01] go back home different and you say wow
[1:27:04] their attitudes different you can see
[1:27:06] there's light around you I I can just
[1:27:08] see their approach that is because God
[1:27:10] has had his way and the contractions
[1:27:13] that we've been feeling for months has
[1:27:15] led up right to this
[1:27:19] moment her hour is come
[1:27:22] Jesus said and as soon as she is
[1:27:26] delivered of the
[1:27:29] child the spoken word of our day God has
[1:27:32] pregnated now the bride of Christ it's
[1:27:35] been laying in the womb of this
[1:27:37] generation when they came out of Egypt
[1:27:40] through Moses god thought of the
[1:27:43] generation that was going to go into the
[1:27:45] promised land but there had to be
[1:27:47] fathers there had to be mothers there
[1:27:49] had to be grandparents there had to be
[1:27:51] Church services for the last 56 years
[1:27:55] plus since
[1:27:56] 1965 there had to be a Wilderness there
[1:27:59] had to be a time there had to be another
[1:28:02] generation there had to be Children of
[1:28:05] Children of Children to show that God's
[1:28:08] word is
[1:28:10] true you ought to be thankful tonight
[1:28:12] that though your eyes have never seen
[1:28:15] though you've never heard physically or
[1:28:16] been in a meeting of brother brandham
[1:28:18] that you can say my eyes have seen I've
[1:28:21] experienced
[1:28:23] that the same Holy
[1:28:30] Spirit the same Angel of the Lord that
[1:28:33] stood in the brandham Tabernacle in

[1:28:54] now I I've got to stay focused tonight
[1:28:56] tonight we've got to be more focused
[1:28:58] than we were last night God forgive
[1:29:01] us but I want to spiritual contractions
[1:29:05] when you speak to young people you're
[1:29:07] dealing with personal
[1:29:09] contractions you're dealing with
[1:29:12] relationship contractions or spasms
[1:29:14] there there's times when it's good and
[1:29:16] there's times when it goes opposite and
[1:29:18] you're dealing with maybe someone's been
[1:29:20] dealing with relationship contractions
[1:29:23] or contractions in a certain
[1:29:26] family I I remember in Poland one year
[1:29:29] when I was preaching there and there was
[1:29:30] a young lady that came to us it was just
[1:29:33] in the front of the building it was
[1:29:35] public but she just began to speak to me
[1:29:37] she was the only young person in her
[1:29:39] church there wasn't a bunch of young
[1:29:42] people there wasn't a big crowd she was
[1:29:45] the only young person in her youth group
[1:29:48] and I gave her just a word of
[1:29:50] encouragement as we spoke I said sister
[1:29:52] It won't always be like this she lived
[1:29:56] way up hours away and I mean those type
[1:29:59] of meetings that we were having was just
[1:30:00] so sacred and so wonderful to her to be
[1:30:03] able to come and be with other brothers
[1:30:05] and sisters but I said it won't always
[1:30:07] be like this and do you know within less
[1:30:10] than a year there was another brother
[1:30:13] that was in the camp meetings and in the
[1:30:14] convention that was a very I would say
[1:30:17] he was one of the leading young men and
[1:30:19] leaders of uh of the message then and he
[1:30:21] was just they were out on the streets
[1:30:23] witnessing they were on fire and they
[1:30:24] were just and and within a year that
[1:30:27] that young brother and that sister
[1:30:29] became in a relationship and now they
[1:30:31] have they're married and have children
[1:30:33] and when you go to Czech Republic or go
[1:30:35] to Poland you'll see this couple with
[1:30:37] their family they sing they they're
[1:30:39] right there as leaders in the message
[1:30:41] why it's because with a birth comes
[1:30:44] patience there's a character are you
[1:30:47] willing to wait until God's time and
[1:30:50] season
[1:30:53] in relationship Con constractions
[1:30:56] constractions in a family there's times
[1:30:58] when there's highs and lows for all of
[1:31:00] our families there's a time when it
[1:31:02] rains and it pours and then there's
[1:31:05] times when the sun comes out and there's
[1:31:07] a time when you go through the summer I
[1:31:10] I spoke to some of our Believers from
[1:31:12] Arizona this week and they were talking
[1:31:14] about the weather and things and you
[1:31:16] know it can get really hot in Arizona
[1:31:17] and it can get really cracked in the in
[1:31:19] the desert and it can get really uh
[1:31:22] humid in other places but it's not
[1:31:24] always summer in your life there will be
[1:31:26] a fall time and there'll be the beauty
[1:31:29] that you can drive to South Carolina and
[1:31:31] go to a youth camp and the leaves are
[1:31:34] beautiful is that true it's and it's
[1:31:37] wonderful to be here in South
[1:31:40] Carolina just outside of Travelers Rest
[1:31:43] and know that God has prepared a little
[1:31:45] womb a little Sanctuary a few days that
[1:31:49] we can St up step away from from our
[1:31:52] busyness of life and get plugged into
[1:31:54] the
[1:31:56] supernatural how many's thankful for
[1:31:58] that tonight and out of the
[1:32:02] womb of this desire is coming a
[1:32:06] generation I want to speak on that
[1:32:08] tomorrow morning the rising generation
[1:32:11] it's not a generation that is the
[1:32:13] backsliding generation or the generation
[1:32:16] that is falling
[1:32:19] falling but you are a rising generation
[1:32:22] you are a Rapture generation you've been
[1:32:25] prophesied it is thus sayeth the Lord
[1:32:28] there will be young people that out of
[1:32:30] this generation will be
[1:32:33] changed in a moment in the twinkling of
[1:32:35] an eye this this spasm this spiritual
[1:32:39] contraction is going to birth through
[1:32:41] your personal contractions your
[1:32:43] relationship contractions your family
[1:32:45] contractions your church family goes
[1:32:48] through times of uh of of uh great
[1:32:51] contraction
[1:32:52] ctions some of you have experienced it
[1:32:54] in
[1:32:56] school I know that you that go to public
[1:32:58] school just ra raise your hand if you go
[1:33:02] to public school or a college or
[1:33:04] university just raise your
[1:33:08] hand I was speaking to a senior brother
[1:33:11] today wow all the way back to the next
[1:33:13] to back row we got young people God
[1:33:15] bless you I was listening hearing a
[1:33:18] testimony today of a minister that's in
[1:33:20] this building right now
[1:33:23] and throughout his uh teenage years and
[1:33:26] things and though he was in a good
[1:33:28] church had a good
[1:33:30] family but it was through the public
[1:33:33] school and through that influence and I
[1:33:35] asked the question when was it that you
[1:33:37] notice this certain uh wildness and this
[1:33:41] certain uh he was in Sunday school he
[1:33:44] was good family but it wasn't during
[1:33:46] that time of public school and that
[1:33:49] influence that's why I'm speaking about
[1:33:51] the negative than the positive because
[1:33:53] we need these positive influences and we
[1:33:57] need times like this God loves young
[1:34:01] people in fact God loves youth so much
[1:34:05] that he said for eternity it's just
[1:34:08] going to be about 18 or 20 years old God
[1:34:11] loves
[1:34:12] youth he loves Vitality he loves
[1:34:16] passion God loves it when young people
[1:34:19] are passionate young people that are on
[1:34:21] fire for God God give us more young

[1:34:55] your contractions in your career as you
[1:34:57] look for even job uh brothers or sisters
[1:35:00] as they go through that time and they
[1:35:02] begin to spasm oh I know I I should know

[1:35:12] contractions that is happening to all of
[1:35:15] us

[1:35:22] further before I go to the
[1:35:28] booths I'm just quivering right here
[1:35:30] with the Holy Spirit is wanting to say
[1:35:32] something right now God has brought you
[1:35:35] from before your

[1:35:51] even in the
[1:35:53] womb he made sure that you came out of
[1:35:56] the womb and he sees you tonight and all
[1:36:00] of the sighing and crying and weeping
[1:36:04] that you have gone through
[1:36:07] personally all of the
[1:36:13] Wailing and the
[1:36:16] travail the Old Testament
[1:36:19] says Mark the
[1:36:22] those that are
[1:36:24] shying and
[1:36:26] crying that have a burden in the
[1:36:29] message in the
[1:36:32] city where are
[1:36:35] those that are
[1:36:38] interested they're interested in a son
[1:36:42] being born a daughter being born why is
[1:36:45] this world so full of feminist and they
[1:36:49] want to have a career before they have a
[1:36:51] baby they don't want their bodies to be
[1:36:53] deformed it shows the spirit of Satan
[1:36:55] that has got on the human race it's a
[1:36:58] perversion when God is trying to get a
[1:37:00] bride pregnant with his
[1:37:03] word you know what I'm talking about
[1:37:05] tonight and all of the travail and
[1:37:08] whale now I'm speaking as a minister
[1:37:11] that's been born and raised in the
[1:37:14] message and the burden on your heart the
[1:37:17] groaning behind the scenes of you as a
[1:37:20] young person
[1:37:22] on your bed at
[1:37:23] night in your classroom you you look
[1:37:27] around and you
[1:37:28] feel weird you feel strange it's not
[1:37:32] home to
[1:37:34] you in your bedroom in your closet maybe
[1:37:38] you just maybe you have to share with a
[1:37:40] sister or with a brother and maybe you
[1:37:42] have a little closet or something and
[1:37:44] God sees you when you close the door God
[1:37:46] sees
[1:37:48] you my my mind is just going right now I
[1:37:52] remember specifically when I was a
[1:37:54] teenager and I was I I don't know why
[1:37:56] I'm going to say this but I was just
[1:37:58] turned 18 years old and I was a night
[1:38:00] manager at a grocery store and there had
[1:38:02] been something happened at the front in
[1:38:04] the registers we were open 24 hours and
[1:38:06] I was checking out some people and I'd
[1:38:08] put all the money all the cash brother
[1:38:10] cadri from i' collected from all the
[1:38:13] teals in a grocery bag and I just put it
[1:38:15] behind me because I was checking out
[1:38:17] someone and when I turned around it was
[1:38:19] gone wow all the checks all the
[1:38:22] cash I
[1:38:25] my this is horrible and I just walked
[1:38:28] through the store and went back into the
[1:38:29] back of the restroom I'm just going to
[1:38:31] be open with you and as I shut the door
[1:38:34] he was
[1:38:35] there you know young people he's going
[1:38:38] to be there yes you say this is private
[1:38:41] or you say I'm just going to close the
[1:38:43] door no God is God knows what you're
[1:38:47] going through in your closet in your
[1:38:50] bedroom when you're in your car on your
[1:38:53] job when you're all alone or when you're
[1:38:56] with others you sense this travail this
[1:39:00] burden and you don't know maybe up till
[1:39:02] tonight what is it why do I feel this
[1:39:06] way it's spiritual
[1:39:09] contractions it's that seed inside of
[1:39:11] you it's that spasming it's that it's
[1:39:14] that uh you you you cannot control this
[1:39:16] you you don't know it's Destiny but God
[1:39:19] does and I just just encourage every
[1:39:22] person tonight just yield to
[1:39:24] that let's all say yield Y and as you've
[1:39:29] gone through these last years and these
[1:39:31] last months some of you been isolated
[1:39:34] and I spent a long time on it last night
[1:39:36] some of you have been separated from
[1:39:38] loved ones and distance and it hasn't
[1:39:40] been
[1:39:43] normal for none of
[1:39:45] us but God has seen your travail he's
[1:39:49] seen your s even of you parents even of
[1:39:52] you older ones even churches now even
[1:39:56] ministers I one of my Minister friends
[1:39:58] that's an elder in this
[1:40:01] message he was going to resign after the
[1:40:04] Sunday night service there been so much
[1:40:06] confusion in the church about you know
[1:40:08] should we be having Services should we
[1:40:10] not and there people saying oh I think
[1:40:12] we should be having Services let's have
[1:40:14] Services another said no we shouldn't be
[1:40:16] having Serv we're not going to he was
[1:40:17] going to resign on the Sunday
[1:40:19] night and there was a visiting Minister
[1:40:22] was in his church brother Jason came
[1:40:24] through that Sunday preached the morning
[1:40:26] and preached T night and God dealt
[1:40:29] mightily in that church and in that in
[1:40:31] that pastor's assembly and he got up at
[1:40:34] the end of the service the pastor and he
[1:40:35] said I was going to resign this Sunday
[1:40:38] night but God has changed my
[1:40:40] heart see it's not just young people
[1:40:43] that are going through issues it's not
[1:40:45] just young people we have young people's
[1:40:48] camps we have young people things but
[1:40:51] sometimes I wonder if we ought to have
[1:40:52] 40 old and plus and old would y'all like
[1:40:55] that
[1:41:01] just young people aren't the
[1:41:04] problem they're a product of their
[1:41:07] families they're a product of their
[1:41:10] churches I know I need to be careful
[1:41:13] here friends but I have in my notes
[1:41:15] written notes that young people thrive
[1:41:18] under Supernatural atmosphere
[1:41:21] they Thrive when the Holy Ghost is
[1:41:26] moving young people feed on the word
[1:41:29] they love Holy Ghost filled music they
[1:41:31] love to be around people that love
[1:41:34] them people that would die for them they
[1:41:38] Thrive under
[1:41:39] that but I understand and I wrote this
[1:41:43] in my notes in Washington before I came
[1:41:46] here many young people that attend
[1:41:49] special meetings like this this go back
[1:41:52] to a home that does not have a nurturing
[1:41:59] atmosphere we have great times and
[1:42:01] brother Burley can Minister brother
[1:42:03] codre is gonna Minister brother Jason
[1:42:05] and brother Matthew he's just done I
[1:42:07] think is
[1:42:09] incredible what brother Matthew and I I
[1:42:11] was with him last night in a personal in
[1:42:14] a personal time with another brother I
[1:42:16] just to see the wisdom of God upon his
[1:42:19] life but I know there's young people
[1:42:21] here that are not going back to a home
[1:42:24] that is
[1:42:26] nurturing they're not going back to an
[1:42:29] environment that is encouraging them
[1:42:31] it's they're going back home to people
[1:42:34] that's going to look down on them and
[1:42:35] say oh yeah we'll see how you are in
[1:42:37] three
[1:42:40] weeks maybe they're going back to an
[1:42:42] atmosphere even in their Church where
[1:42:44] there's a lot of skepticism and and and
[1:42:48] trouble so God giv give us a
[1:42:51] supernatural atmosphere while we're
[1:42:54] together like this my heart is
[1:42:58] groaning yeah we all want a Revival we
[1:43:02] all want to see a move of God but are we
[1:43:05] really willing to be honest enough and
[1:43:07] humble
[1:43:09] enough this past year I was speaking to
[1:43:12] a father in the message and can I be
[1:43:15] open tonight we're talking about
[1:43:17] contractions and we're talking about
[1:43:18] things we're going through in the
[1:43:20] message and as young people I was
[1:43:22] talking to the father and just
[1:43:24] discussing his teenage daughter she's a
[1:43:27] beautiful young
[1:43:29] lady beautiful young teenager raised in
[1:43:32] a message church
[1:43:33] and you know I seen her in the meetings
[1:43:36] and I see her and her
[1:43:39] family I actually saw her at a place of
[1:43:42] work where she was and she had earrings
[1:43:45] on
[1:43:46] and you could just see through the side
[1:43:48] of her shirt her her her bra and
[1:43:51] everything
[1:43:52] and she needed the
[1:43:56] Lord but what was so amazing when
[1:43:59] speaking to her father he was just
[1:44:01] giving me the testimonies and talking
[1:44:03] about his family and his life he said oh
[1:44:05] I know she has the Holy Ghost I know my
[1:44:08] daughter has the Holy Ghost and I didn't
[1:44:11] say anything to my precious brother and
[1:44:14] friend but I thought are we talking
[1:44:17] about the same
[1:44:19] person this person lives with you this
[1:44:22] person is in your home and yet publicly
[1:44:25] it's so obvious she's struggling she's
[1:44:28] not where she not just struggling she's
[1:44:30] manifesting a lot she's crying
[1:44:33] out and I thought God help all of us not
[1:44:36] to be so
[1:44:38] deceived we can be right in an
[1:44:40] environment and think everything's okay
[1:44:43] and it's not
[1:44:47] okay just today just between Services
[1:44:50] you know know we went back to our room
[1:44:52] again and and was alone and I was able
[1:44:54] to view a wedding of brother Ben steeman
[1:44:58] from Florida and sister Adriana puit
[1:45:00] they were married this afternoon and I
[1:45:02] thought of these families and thought of
[1:45:04] a young couple that has been probably
[1:45:06] influenced most of you and you've been
[1:45:08] around them or seen their brother Danny
[1:45:11] steeman as the pastor and brother Tim
[1:45:13] puit which we dearly love but for them
[1:45:15] to be married this afternoon and know
[1:45:17] they can live their lives before they're
[1:45:19] married and now after after they're
[1:45:24] married we're really quiet
[1:45:26] tonight but God has given you a virgin
[1:45:30] womb and he's given you a spiritual
[1:45:32] virgin womb and we ought to be fighting
[1:45:34] for that with everything that's within
[1:45:37] us guard your
[1:45:39] heart I speak to all of the beautiful
[1:45:42] young ladies and all the young men guard
[1:45:44] your
[1:45:45] heart don't trade it for Treasure don't
[1:45:48] trade it for a job or career rear a fast
[1:45:54] car don't let your heart get taken by
[1:45:57] the world and regret your decisions
[1:46:00] later this is why we're having these
[1:46:02] meetings to create an atmosphere around
[1:46:07] you how many knows what I'm talking
[1:46:09] about when I say crying out or groaning
[1:46:12] or
[1:46:14] [Music]

[1:47:53] through the most of service last night
[1:47:55] and I mentioned it to my wife I thought
[1:47:57] and she said are you

[1:48:02] for a guy I saw him sleeping in church I
[1:48:04] wouldn't even think about him I'd Dro
[1:48:06] him right

[1:49:14] days all that are Israelites born shall
[1:49:17] dwell in
[1:49:19] booths that your generation may
[1:49:22] know that I made the children of Israel
[1:49:25] to dwell in
[1:49:27] booths when I brought them out of the
[1:49:29] land of
[1:49:31] Egypt I am the Lord your
[1:49:34] God this is
[1:49:36] incredible this is God laying out in the
[1:49:39] Book of
[1:49:40] Leviticus I want the church I want the
[1:49:43] Believers of the message to know they
[1:49:46] need to make boo anyone born that's an
[1:49:49] Israel it should dwell in boo then why

[1:49:56] we've never heard of it do you know do
[1:49:58] you know what friends it's very amazing
[1:49:59] we're going to turn to Nehemiah chapter
[1:50:01] 8
[1:50:03] now this went on for years all the way
[1:50:06] to the brother Joshua
[1:50:09] and when Joshua crossed Jordan was
[1:50:15] 1,451
[1:50:16] BC now what we're reading tonight is the
[1:50:20] year
[1:50:21] 445 over a thousand years later since
[1:50:25] Joshua is everyone listening let's say
[1:50:28] Joshua Joshua it wasn't in the
[1:50:31] message they neglected booths we're
[1:50:35] going to read it in just a few minutes
[1:50:36] but for since the days of Joshua the son
[1:50:38] of none until the day had not the
[1:50:40] children of Israel done so it's like
[1:50:43] what's a booth what's a
[1:50:45] booth we all want Revival we all want
[1:50:48] everyone to have a Authority and come to
[1:50:51] your place but if you neglect the booth
[1:50:53] you're just going to keep going around
[1:50:55] in
[1:50:56] circles Nehemiah chapter 8 verse1 14 now
[1:51:00] this is Ezra standing up behind the
[1:51:06] pulpit Nehemiah 8:14 and they found
[1:51:09] written in the law this is was Leviticus
[1:51:12] they found which the Lord had commanded
[1:51:14] by Moses that the children of Israel
[1:51:16] should dwell in booths in the feast
[1:51:20] of the seventh month now if I can just
[1:51:23] have your attention the seventh month
[1:51:25] for the Jewish race was October this
[1:51:29] very month that we're in tonight for the
[1:51:32] Jews was a season of the booths and then
[1:51:35] the Feast of
[1:51:37] Tabernacles in verse 14 that we just
[1:51:39] read was that they found it is in the
[1:51:41] Book of Leviticus what we just read that
[1:51:44] the children of Israel should dwell in
[1:51:45] booze in the Feast of the seventh month
[1:51:50] verse 15 and that they should publish
[1:51:53] and Proclaim in all their
[1:51:55] cities in Johnson City and Florida and
[1:51:59] Phoenix and Idaho and South Carolina
[1:52:03] North
[1:52:04] Carolina hello I know those are States
[1:52:07] but I don't know all the cities you're
[1:52:09] from but here we are saying go forth
[1:52:12] unto the mount and fetch Olive branches
[1:52:15] and pine branches and Myrtle branches
[1:52:17] and palm branches and branches of thick
[1:52:20] trees to make Boos that is it is written
[1:52:23] so the people went forth and brought
[1:52:25] them and made themselves
[1:52:28] Boos everyone upon the roof of his house
[1:52:33] and in their courts and in the courts of
[1:52:36] the house of God and in the streets of
[1:52:38] the Watergate and in the street of the
[1:52:40] Gate of Ephraim verse 17 and all the
[1:52:43] congregation of them that were come
[1:52:47] again out of the Captivity made by Boos
[1:52:50] or the message struck their
[1:52:54] hearts everyone started to make
[1:52:58] Boos and sat under the booths for since
[1:53:02] the days of Joshua that's Joshua the son
[1:53:06] of none until that day had not the
[1:53:08] children of Israel done so and there was
[1:53:11] very great gladness great glad like it's
[1:53:14] going to be at the end of this service

[1:53:20] the mark and God's going to answer your

[1:53:37] appreciate that are the slides that we
[1:53:40] can go to right now so I I thought I'd
[1:53:43] make some pictures of Booth so that we'd
[1:53:45] all get to understand a
[1:53:47] booth is like a Thicket
[1:53:51] it's like a covert or a booth was a rude
[1:53:54] temporary shelter kind of like your body

[1:53:59] temporary you're going to get a new
[1:54:02] body who's going to get a new body amen

[1:54:29] temporary shelter like a hedge with a
[1:54:32] fence around it like being shut in it
[1:54:35] was like let's make Boo and let's get in
[1:54:38] there it was like a temporary shelter
[1:54:40] where you could kneel down where you
[1:54:42] could pray it wasn't for the public
[1:54:46] crowd a booth was something that you
[1:54:48] were to do your
[1:54:50] yourself to prepare for the feast all

[1:55:10] something that is to block
[1:55:13] out it's to something overshadow and
[1:55:16] Screen you to stop the approach to shut

[2:04:28] they bring the branches let's it's not a
[2:04:31] huge massive place where you invite
[2:04:32] everybody it's a more of a private booth
[2:04:35] where there's let me just say it like
[2:04:38] this for us tonight a booth speaks of a
[2:04:41] place of Consecration and a greater
[2:04:44] dedication where God could restore and
[2:04:47] bring back a spirit spiritual
[2:04:50] life that is consecrated and fully
[2:04:53] surrendered to
[2:04:56] Christ that's what I'm speaking about

[2:06:04] that since the days of Joshua they had
[2:06:06] not celebrated this 1,000 years listen
[2:06:10] really close a thousand years they had
[2:06:14] stopped making
[2:06:17] booths
[2:06:19] in the church in the young people they
[2:06:22] didn't know what it was to be
[2:06:23] consecrated they didn't know what it was
[2:06:25] to have a fully surrender personal walk
[2:06:27] with God it had been neglected wowow and
[2:06:31] I say tonight from
[2:06:33] 1965 to 221 is 56 years since our
[2:06:37] Prophet has
[2:06:39] left but I'm announcing to you there is
[2:06:42] a
[2:06:43] generation that God is restoring and
[2:06:46] bringing back their right Minds that we

[2:13:52] to you're not of this world you don't
[2:13:56] even fit in good let me just be honest
[2:13:59] there over the last few years there's
[2:14:01] been people leave the
[2:14:03] message I've known a lot of them very
[2:14:06] personally and their children do you
[2:14:08] know what happens they end up worse than
[2:14:11] people in the
[2:14:12] world how many can testify you've seen
[2:14:15] that their hair grows pink green yellow
[2:14:19] they turn into homosexuals and lesbians

[2:14:40] spiritual
[2:14:42] contractions they didn't understand what
[2:14:44] birth pains was or they got embarrassed
[2:14:47] when you talk talked about it their face
[2:14:48] got all red they couldn't go all the way
[2:14:52] to Pentecost they they kind of stumbled
[2:14:54] around some of them were worship
[2:14:58] leaders some of them were Dynamic
[2:15:03] pastors some of them were young people
[2:15:05] that could sing a special and give a
[2:15:07] testimony and some of you would say it
[2:15:09] like this they brought the house
[2:15:12] down and tonight they're worse than
[2:15:16] people in the world they've gone crazy
[2:15:19] times

[2:15:25] of god it should make you better it
[2:15:27] should make you grow more like the Lord
[2:15:29] if they got a greater Revelation it they
[2:15:31] should be more like Christ is that
[2:15:33] true talk to me tonight if somebody has
[2:15:36] a greater Revelation it should show in
[2:15:38] their lives it it should show in their
[2:15:40] patience that they should be able to put
[2:15:42] up with you if they've got a greater
[2:15:45] patience and a greater love that's right
[2:15:48] if they have a greater Revelation than
[2:15:50] the message they ought to live more
[2:15:52] Holier come on
[2:15:57] everybody but just look at it they they
[2:16:00] go worse they go weird they go wild yeah

[2:24:27] question is this apple sweet or
[2:24:30] sour now he's talking to the Infidel
[2:24:32] that had just got done saying there's no
[2:24:34] such a thing as God this message isn't
[2:24:37] true all this about the Holy Ghost is
[2:24:40] just
[2:24:43] drama and this young man took a bite of

[2:33:03] lady before we come into the prayer line
[2:33:07] I see a young
[2:33:10] lady has been raised in the message
[2:33:13] also actually ad ministers
[2:33:16] coming through a time of her teenage
[2:33:20] years she's
[2:33:23] struggling doesn't matter what your name
[2:33:25] is or where you live or who your pastor
[2:33:29] is Satan will come in those demon
[2:33:32] spirits of
[2:33:36] depression I'm going somewhere with
[2:33:38] this and you talk about the groaning you
[2:33:41] talk about the travail you talk about on
[2:33:44] your bed you talk about when you're
[2:33:46] alone and you're talking about everyone
[2:33:47] else could be happy but there's still
[2:33:50] that Spirit hanging over
[2:33:52] you and you're never good enough and
[2:33:54] you're always
[2:33:57] condemned and she goes through her
[2:33:59] teenage years and no matter how good the
[2:34:02] music
[2:34:03] was no matter how good the preaching
[2:34:07] was she was struggling in herself and it
[2:34:12] through the awkward times of teenage
[2:34:15] years
[2:34:17] and she becomes so struggling with this
[2:34:21] she begin to cut
[2:34:25] herself another young lady that I'm
[2:34:28] thinking about was in high school too
[2:34:30] and she began to cut herself because
[2:34:32] those Spirits are wanting to uh take
[2:34:35] your life and they're also wanting to
[2:34:37] bring attention there's a cry for help
[2:34:39] what does anybody here that cry for help
[2:34:43] we can be right around people that are
[2:34:45] about ready to shatter and break apart
[2:34:48] and not even know it I want to stop
[2:34:50] right here and say God help all of us to
[2:34:52] be more
[2:34:53] sensitive there could be somebody at
[2:34:55] this camp that is just
[2:34:57] struggling even right now battling
[2:34:59] darkness and demons and devils and I
[2:35:02] hear the clanking of chains and this
[2:35:04] young lady was begin to cut herself and
[2:35:07] in another situation I said we got to
[2:35:10] get her out of that situation we got to
[2:35:12] get her out of there and we got her into
[2:35:14] a church school and she was able to grow
[2:35:16] up in another environment and met her
[2:35:18] husband and tonight she has four
[2:35:20] wonderful
[2:35:22] boys and she loves this
[2:35:24] message can we thank God for bringing
[2:35:27] her out of that Mar
[2:35:38] clay you Satan what have loved for us to
[2:35:41] have another funeral service and another
[2:35:44] meeting like brother John had being
[2:35:46] raised in the brandham Tabernacle and
[2:35:48] the Deacon's son my best
[2:35:53] friend the Deacon son and if I said his
[2:35:57] name most of you would know his last
[2:36:00] name the pastor's grandson I was his
[2:36:03] best friend being raised up and we'd go
[2:36:05] to his house and we'd have great times
[2:36:08] and we'd be together and as he came up
[2:36:09] into high school and he was on the
[2:36:12] student council he was popular and he
[2:36:14] had a truck and everything
[2:36:20] but one day and nobody knew but he just
[2:36:24] drove up into an isolated
[2:36:28] place and took his life and I'll never
[2:36:32] forget it brother Jason standing in the
[2:36:35] gravide there in Jeffersonville where
[2:36:36] brother brandham is also buried and many
[2:36:38] other
[2:36:39] people and the mother here we're now
[2:36:43] we're about ready to bury this young
[2:36:45] man's body
[2:36:46] and the mother just
[2:36:48] wailing I never had a chance to say
[2:36:53] goodbye and there were school buses and
[2:36:56] school buses from his school he was so
[2:36:59] popular that came to the brandham
[2:37:01] Tabernacle I never had a chance to say
[2:37:03] goodbye Satan took a life in a moment of
[2:37:07] depression and hardship I said God save
[2:37:10] our young
[2:37:11] people deliver them from the LIE of the
[2:37:14] enemy I'm here tonight to push back
[2:37:17] against that
[2:37:30] Darkness so this young lady she began to
[2:37:33] cut herself and and and Satan had just
[2:37:36] brought her to such a deep depression
[2:37:38] and hardship
[2:37:41] and the awkwardness and time through her
[2:37:44] life but I thank God God dealt with that
[2:37:47] young lady's life and she had a most
[2:37:50] wonderful conversion God filled her with
[2:37:52] the Holy Ghost and she's been
[2:37:58] changed and one year after
[2:38:01] that she's in a meeting full of hundreds
[2:38:05] of other young people just packed out
[2:38:07] around March or April in Louisiana and
[2:38:11] people are standing they're praising
[2:38:12] they're rejoicing they just want to
[2:38:14] praise the Lord they want to Worship the
[2:38:16] Lord they just want to give God praise
[2:38:19] and glory like you have been this
[2:38:20] weekend and she saw other people
[2:38:23] praising and thanking God but because of
[2:38:25] her past and what she had gone through
[2:38:27] there were scars there were
[2:38:29] scars and you you all know in March and
[2:38:32] April there it can get humid and she
[2:38:35] just had on a shirt that was a short
[2:38:37] seve shirt she said I'd be so
[2:38:39] embarrassed brother Jason I'd be so
[2:38:40] embarrassed to know that I had gone
[2:38:42] through that that kind of thing I
[2:38:44] wouldn't want everybody to know
[2:38:46] I would be ashamed to know that I had
[2:38:49] gone so low being raised in the message
[2:38:51] that I wanted to take my life I don't
[2:38:53] want to tell
[2:38:55] nobody but I think sometimes we need to
[2:38:58] tell those around us so that others know
[2:39:03] we're not a bunch of Angels in this
[2:39:04] building tonight we're Sons and
[2:39:06] Daughters of God that are groaning under
[2:39:09] travail I've got to find you where are
[2:39:14] you
[2:39:20] and she sited in the meeting she says
[2:39:21] Lord I Want To Praise You I want to
[2:39:23] glorify your name she just passed the
[2:39:26] point where she said I don't care what
[2:39:28] other people think I'm going to stand
[2:39:29] and praise God anyhow I'm going to give
[2:39:31] God worship I'm going to give God praise
[2:39:33] and she stood up on her feet begin to
[2:39:35] Worship the Lord and thank the
[2:39:38] Lord and when she sat down she looked at
[2:39:41] her arm and the scars were gone wow all
[2:39:44] the scars
[2:39:58] God's able to take the memory able to
[2:40:00] take the scar able to take the issue
[2:40:04] able to take your past God's in the
[2:40:07] delivering business God's in the saving
[2:40:11] business can the musicians all come
[2:40:13] wherever you're at can the musicians
[2:40:15] come
[2:40:17] how many believe what God did for others
[2:40:20] he can do for
[2:40:21] you how many believe what God did for
[2:40:24] some of your fathers and your
[2:40:26] mothers and people that are older God
[2:40:29] can do for
[2:40:31] you I don't think we need to be ashamed
[2:40:33] you older ones that we also struggled as
[2:40:37] Youth and we don't have the time tonight
[2:40:40] to hear Brother John's
[2:40:43] testimony but thank God one day the
[2:40:47] lights came
[2:40:48] on can any adult stand on your feet you
[2:40:51] that are 18 or older and say God's done
[2:40:53] a work in my life and I want to give
[2:40:55] praise to God brother y don't leave
[2:40:58] brother Travis just any adults want to
[2:41:00] stand and say God's done a work in my
[2:41:02] life Yes to God be praised to God be
[2:41:05] praised there's nothing to be ashamed of
[2:41:07] nothing to be ashamed we thank you Lord
[2:41:09] how many of you that are standing can
[2:41:11] say what he did for me what he did for
[2:41:13] older ones he can do for the rest of
[2:41:16] these taste and see that the Lord is
[2:41:21] good God bless you you can have your
[2:41:28] seats I wonder if that sister now that's
[2:41:32] married and has wonderful children that
[2:41:34] I just spoke about if she'd stand on her
[2:41:44] feet
[2:41:51] oh taste and
[2:41:54] see sister Deb I don't think everyone
[2:41:56] saw your stand some didn't even know we
[2:41:59] thought you were always like
[2:42:01] this we thought that Deb was always like
[2:42:04] this but God rich in Mercy poured
[2:42:08] himself down into a life and older ones
[2:42:11] you don't need to be ashamed of your
[2:42:13] past you can say what God did for me he
[2:42:15] can do for anybody
[2:42:30] else I didn't think I would embarrass
[2:42:33] you sister Deb but I know that when I
[2:42:36] heard this testimony and I know many of
[2:42:38] you have heard it and we took it around
[2:42:39] the world in the last few months
[2:42:41] literally and I let sister Deb know this
[2:42:43] privately with my wife there
[2:42:46] every time we give this testimony
[2:42:48] brother Jason every time in Europe all
[2:42:52] through the states the whole
[2:42:54] congregation just burst out there's such
[2:42:57] a release there's such like a a a
[2:42:59] praising God every place we've been I
[2:43:01] thought wow what God can do for a young
[2:43:03] lady what God can do for a young
[2:43:07] man and the ministers are going to come
[2:43:09] now we're going to gather behind this
[2:43:11] curtain and pray I think brother
[2:43:13] Matthew's going to take this pulpit and
[2:43:15] then I believe the spiritual
[2:43:18] contractions that's been going on and
[2:43:21] the booths now that God has been
[2:43:23] preparing for all of us God is going to
[2:43:25] birth out into a wonderful Victory in

[2:43:37] struggle and the travail of soul body
[2:43:40] and
[2:43:41] spirit even the songs that were sang
[2:43:43] tonight as we sang and move the service
[2:43:46] up a half hour early to give a little
