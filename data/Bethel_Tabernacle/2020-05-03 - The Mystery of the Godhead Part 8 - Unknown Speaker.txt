and quicken them to our hearts father we commit ourselves to you in Jesus name Amen god bless you can be seated so I'm going to continue on mystery of the Godhead part 8 and I I came across some interesting things and in my studies today and sometimes what comes up is there's a confusion about the word person when we're talking about three persons versus one person and of course God is obviously one person he's not three persons but I came across this I hope you can read that there's a there's a man I think he's on the radio often here even he's a he's a preacher and a theologian from Ireland named Alister McGrath and by everybody's estimation he's very much quote/unquote Orthodox Trinitarian but I want you to listen to how he describes this the word persons and it this is actually shocking to me the way he describes it because it's pretty much what we're what brother branham taught us so he says the word person has changed its meaning since the third century when it began to be used in connection with the threefold nests of God when we talk about God as a person we naturally think of God as being one person but theologians such as Tertullian writing in the third century used the word person with a different meaning the word person originally derives from the Latin word persona meaning an actor's face or mask and by extension the role which he played so that was the original meaning of the word person when they first put it in place so then we go he goes on and he says by stating that there were three persons but only one God Tertullian was asserting that all three major roles in the great drama of human Redemption are played by the one and the same God the three great roles in this drama are all played by the same actor Wow God each of these roles may reveal God in a somewhat different way but it is the same God in every case so when we talk about God as one person we mean one person in the modern sense of the word and we talk about God as three persons we mean three persons in the ancient sense of the word confusing these two senses of the word person inevitably leads to the idea that God is an actual actually a committee Wow so this is what an Orthodox Trinitarian is describing he's saying God is not a committee of three separate and distinct persons in the modern sense that we understand persons he's telling us that's a that's an error to understand it that way but nevertheless this is what Trinitarians understand it as two throughout history and it's a it's an error it's a it's a very terrible theological error there's one God he's one person but he reveals himself through three different masks that's what Alister McGrath is saying his understanding of the Trinity is it's not wrong it's not wrong I was just blown away when I read that with that said I want to start going in looking a little bit we talked about the difference between the Greek philosophical way of looking at the Godhead and the Jewish understanding of the Godhead and so I'm gonna start looking at some some of the ways the Jews understand who God is this is actually taken from a catechism for Jewish children it says I believe with a firm faith that there exists a Creator who blessed be his name has created and governs all his creatures and that he alone has made does make and will make all things that can by any possibility that that by any possibility have existence I believe with the firm faith that the Creator is one and there's no unity like him in any manner and that he alone is our God who was who is and who will be I believe with the firm faith that the blessed Creator is in corporal that no bodily infirmities or accidents can reach him and that he can be compared to nothing corporal of which we can form any idea I believe with the firm faith that the blessed creator is the first and the last I believe with a firm faith that the blessed creator is the only one to whom we should pray and there's besides him no being to whom we ought to address our prayers and so this is the Jewish understanding now they they take it and they bring it so far to the point where they don't believe that God could appear in human flesh but they contradict their very own scriptures which they claim to believe they claim to believe that God appeared to Abraham in any eighth which and drank milk they believe that God appeared in the form of Melchizedek to Abraham so God can take on a human form absolutely but even more than that is that God made his sons and daughters in his very image and likeness and so God's actually God's purpose was to reveal himself in human form and so in these things they've gotten off the track and they've taken it too far but with that said this is a this is a true and right understanding God is a spirit he's he's not limited by only a hue only a human body or a spiritual but even just a spiritual body he's beyond that but yet he's taken the form of the logos stick in the form of the pillar of fire he's taken the form of Melchizedek all these different things he's appeared at and he took the form of Jesus Christ now he's taking the form of the body of Christ the Bride of Christ so Jewish belief is that God is one God is an undivided unity the creed that the Jews believe in is Deuteronomy 6 verse 4 here o Israel the Lord our God is one Lord Jesus and Paul both reaffirm this simple confession mark 12 28 and 29 and one of the scribes came and having heard them reasoning and perceiving that he had answered them well asked him which is the first commandment of all and jesus answered him the first of all commandments is hear o Israel the Lord our God is one Lord so he reaffirms that very simple basic commandment and Paul and Galatians 3:27 a mediator is not a mediator of one but God is one and we read the other translation the amplified for that and says but God is one person so Jesus Paul all the apostles never changed to belief in three distinct persons but here is the concept that comes to us on the left side there is the Trinity that's the concept that we get in artwork and so there's three separate and distinct persons and they're one because they're made up of the same substance so this is nothing less than belief in three gods if this is their understanding of the Trinity now as we read Alistair McAllister McGrath his his thought on the Trinity and I think many people of today's day and age is different than this concept of the Trinity of three separate and distinct persons that are as a committee in fellowship for all eternity the biblical truth we see on the right this is the picture that God gives of himself in his heavenly court there's one throne in heaven for one God Isaiah 6 verse 1 in the year that King Uzziah died I saw also the Lord sitting upon a throne high and lifted up in his train filled the temple how many did he see he saw the Lord sitting upon how many Thrones a throne he didn't see three three thrones he didn't see two thrones he saw one throne ezekiel 1:26 and above the firmament that was over their heads was the likeness of a throne and as the as the appearance excuse me an above the firmament that was over their heads was the likeness of a throne how many Thrones a throne one throne as the appearance of a sapphire stone and upon the likeness of the throne the throne not the Thrones was the likeness of the appearance of a man above upon it so this is what God pictures himself as you say well that's just the Old Testament that was just for the Jews alright well let's go to the New Testament revelation 4 2 through 4 and immediately I was in the spirit and behold Thrones were set in heaven now a throne was set in heaven how many sat on the throne and one sat on the throne so the New Testament reveals it in even greater detail it says specifically uses the word one how many is one is it two three ten thousand this one and he he that sat was to look upon like a Jasper and a sardine stone and there was a rainbow round about the throne in sight like unto an emerald and round about the throne were four and 20 seats and upon the seats I saw four and twenty elders sitting clothed in white raiment and they had on their heads crowns of gold so there we see the picture and you say well Jesus was a in a little throne sitting next to the right hand of God revelation three says I overcame Jesus and I overcame and him sit down in my Father's throne so what throne is Jesus sitting on there's no picture of a little throne sitting next to to God's throne there's not two persons there there's one person there's one that's sitting upon the throne that's the Lord Jesus Christ so just gonna go through some important verses about the oneness of God 1st Timothy 6 16 who only so only means alone it means by definition there's just one person this is verses talking about it's not talking about two persons three persons who alone has immortality dwelling in the light which no man can approach unto whom no man hath seen nor can see to whom be honor and power everlasting amen 1st Timothy 2 verse 5 for there is one God and one mediator between God and men the man Christ Jesus isaiah 44:24 thus saith the lord thy Redeemer and he that only from the womb I am the Lord that maketh all things that stretches forth the heavens alone that spreadeth abroad the earth by myself now I don't know how much clearer that can get that this is speaking about one person but you say it says let us make man in our own image okay so then you explain this verse come here and explain the verse he says let us make man in our own image but then the neck very next verse it says in the image of God made he him male and female made he them so one verse it says us the next verse immediately it's back to singular personal pronoun and then we hear that God says he did it alone God Himself did it so what does God do we you witness it through the through the scriptures he says let us he says who will go for us it's it's clear there's one person sitting on one throne and he has he's a singular personal pronoun one person not three isaiah 43:10 and 11 you are my witnesses saith the lord and my sermon who servant whom i have chosen that you may know and believe me and understand that I am he before me there was no God formed neither shall there be after me I even I am the Lord and besides me there is no Savior there's one god there's one Savior now I want you to notice what he said he said I am he when he when he met Moses he said I am that I am now Jesus was speaking understand he was a man he had to get a beginning and in time but who was speaking there when he when they were saying you you're a man you know you're not even older than 50 years old and you say you've seen Abraham what did he say before Abraham was I am he was completely identifying himself as the the Living God of Israel right in front of them they said you ever met you they were focusing on is manhood and Jesus trying to see who is on display here before Abraham was I am and that's the same thing in vindication when God is vindicating himself that son of man ministry revealing the presence of God who is here the I am he is revealing himself he's manifesting himself what is the sign of the Messiah doing it's showing the I am is present it's the unveiling of the invisible God whom no man has seen nor can see and yet we've seen him we beheld him no not in and of himself no one can but in his manifestation you see him John 4:24 God is a spirit and they that worship Him must worship Him in spirit and in truth I love this verse I often forget the context he was speaking to a woman who was an unclean woman that based upon his culture each never should have been speaking to her and the apart the disciples came back and they were shocked they were so he was speaking to her but what did what was he doing this was a Samaritan what was he showing this is what God this is the kind of worship that God wants don't worry about temples don't worry about coming to this mountain for the Samaritans the father seeks these kind of worshipers the ones that worship Him in spirit and in truth why why does he do that because God is a spirit he's not an idol that lives in a temple he's not limited to one little space wherever you are whether you're in a church or in your home in the mountain at your job you can worship God in spirit and in truth isn't that beautiful God is a spirit God is not a man God is not a human being God is an eternal spirit he never had a beginning never had an ending he covers all space and time the Bible says the heaven and the heaven of heavens cannot contain him now he brother Branham says he's not like the air we understand that that's absolutely true he's he's greater than everything the heaven in the heavens of can't contain him he also brother Branham also says he covers all space and time so in what sense is he not just like the air because he lives in a body he has an expression he has a manifestation that's the logos when God wanted to reveal himself out of God went the logos and that became the body the theophany of God the expression of who God is but yet God is still a spirit he's not limited just by one spiritual body brother Branham says he's not Jesus only and the Jesus only doctrine he says it's wrong Feast of the trumpets he says the mysteries even of the baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus and away from the oneness idea and so when I'm talking about the oneness of God I'm not referring to United United Pentecostal Church doctrine not referring to Jesus only doctrine I'm not even referring to the oneness doctrine I'm referring to that well the scripture that emphasizes that God is one person in 59 and the Palmer work worm locust cankerworm caterpillar brother Branham says many of you get off the wrong track when you try to think that God is one like your finger is one he can't be his own father he can't be now brother Branham is not trying to say there's three persons or there's two persons he's saying that the the invisible God who is a spirit he unfolds himself so when you have the invisible spirit that out of God so out of him went the logos so the logos is now with God we have an by number we have a distinction just like you are a body soul and spirit you're one person you're one express your but that your expressed in three different ways you're expressed through your soul you're expressed through your spirit and you're expressed by your body in those different senses that go along with it but you're you're not one like your fingers one neither is God one like your fingers one he's the unfolding God and Jesus is not his own father as per his humanity who is Jesus the Son of God John 1:18 no man has seen God at any time the only begotten Son which is in the bosom of the Father he hath declared him Jesus Christ is the image of the invisible God when you see him you're seeing God Colossians 1:15 who is the image of the invisible God the firstborn of every creature it's such a beautiful picture the scripture gives us when you see this God is invisible no man has seen him in at any time and yet he expresses himself he brings forth from himself a part of himself in order to reveal himself that's what you heard if we can understand who Jesus is correctly according to Scripture then we can see who we are if we don't understand him correctly and we make him a member a second member of the Godhead we can never understand who we are who we are Hebrews 1 2 and 3 we've already read that another one's I'm just gonna skip over that John 14 8 through 10 Philip saith unto Him Lord show us the father and it sufficeth us jesus saith unto him I love it have I been so long time with you and yet you have not known me Philip he that has seen me has seen the father and how sayest thou then show us the father believe is thou not that I am in the father and the father in me the words that I speak unto you I speak not of myself but the father that dwelleth in me he doeth the works sick where he where have you been Philip you've been watching you've seen what's been going on you're looking at the father right now okay Jesus is not his own father we under we understand that but as to expression who is Jesus the father he's expressed he is the father the invisible God made visible he is the man he's God manifests in the flesh second Corinthians 5:19 to wit that God was in Christ reconciling the world unto himself not imputing their trespasses unto them and hath committed unto us the word of reconciliation second Corinthians 4:6 for God was commanded the light to shine out of darkness as shined in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ I love that the glory of God the Shekinah glory the very logos itself is revealed and manifested through what the face of Jesus Christ so you want to see the glory of God see Jesus Christ you have to see Jesus Christ let's go let's go a little bit further beyond that what is the bride called today the body of Christ so where is the glory of God manifested today through the body of Christ it's Christ is the beginning of the creation of God the body of Christ is the continuation of the creation of God he's the firstborn among from among the dad he's the firstfruits were the continuation first Timothy 3:16 and without controversy great is the mystery of godliness God was manifest in the flesh justified in the spirit seen of angels preached unto the Gentiles believed on in the world received up into glory beautiful Paul doesn't just leave that as a past tense thing he says God was manifest in the flesh but he's saying God was preached unto the Gentiles believed on in the world this he's continually being manifested in the flesh jesus never himself went to the gentiles right the scripture also says Paul says regarding his ministry it's a verse about the Messiah and he says the Messiah is going to be the light unto the Gentiles and Paul refers that to his ministry as a fulfillment of that scripture Wow isn't that beautiful Christ in you the hope of glory Matthew 16:13 very important verse for understanding the Godhead when Jesus came into the coasts of Caesarea Philippi he asked his disciples saying whom do men say that I the Son of Man am and you know they answered some say you're this some say Jeremiah or one of the prophets or John the Baptist and then he asked them but who do you say that I am and verse 16 and 17 and Simon Peter answered and said thou art the Christ the Son of the Living God and jesus answered and said unto him blessed art thou simon barjona for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee but my father which is in heaven Who am I he said Who am I you guys you're the Messiah The Anointed One the Son of the Living God and he says this revelation was given by the father break it down for a second Peter is looking at flesh and blood he's looking at a man standing in front of him he's following physically following him and Jesus says it wasn't any of that that revealed it it wasn't any human thinking it wasn't any human reasoning but the father came to you Simon and revealed the truth of who I am son of the living this verse doesn't make any sense but the fact is that the the Godhead that's that's the divine nature is what it's speaking of the at in other words the attributes of what makes God God and so here Paul is writing in Jesus Christ dwells all the nature and attributes of God everything that God is is revealed through Christ it's hid correct he's not a third he's not a member of the Trinity all that God is all his nature is put into and revealed through Christ Christ is the body and the father is the Godhead says who's doing the works my father that dwelleth in me does the works in him dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily doesn't say he is all the fullness of the Godhead bodily but it says it dwells in him and it's manifested through him Christ being the body the Son of God the man the father being the eternal spirit that dwells in him and manifests himself through him so who are we looking at when we're looking at Jesus Christ the father the I am the great I am amen so let's stand and pray gracious father we just come to you now Lord and we ask that your spirit would just abide with us continually Lord I pray you bless the service today I pray that your Holy Spirit would just move in every heart in every home lord I pray that your word Lord would have preeminence in every home father we just want to commit ourselves to you and ask that you'd be glorified in all things we ask these things in the name of Jesus Christ amen god bless you
