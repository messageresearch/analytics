[34:33] chapter
[34:34] 1 and we hope by the will of the Lord
[34:37] just to continue today and perhaps uh
[34:40] make a little conclusion in this little
[34:42] three-part um series I suppose I would
[34:46] call it um I didn't actually name the
[34:49] series per se but um it's been running a
[34:52] certain theme that we announced and
[34:55] today we hope to come to um the end of
[34:58] Darkness rise of the day star amen so uh
[35:02] we started with end to the darkness and
[35:04] then part two was dark and darker still
[35:07] and then we're moving today to the end
[35:09] of Darkness rise of the day star I trust
[35:12] it's been a blessing to you it sure has
[35:13] been to me my goodness certainly enjoyed
[35:16] it amen God bless you second Peter
[35:19] chapter 1 and um I'm glad to have a
[35:23] comfortable temperature in here amen we
[35:26] um when we disconnect Ed all of our gas
[35:28] lines to pour the slab we didn't connect
[35:30] anything back and then winter jumped in
[35:33] on us so we're running some space
[35:35] heaters today we'll get that back up and
[35:37] running ASAP though amen we're just
[35:39] under a little bit of construction
[35:41] second Peter chapter 1 verse 16 to
[35:48] 21 for we have not followed cunningly
[35:52] devised fables when we made known unto
[35:56] you the power and and coming of our Lord
[35:58] Jesus Christ but were eyewitnesses of
[36:02] his majesty now I want you to notice
[36:04] right off the bat that Peter joins in
[36:08] that single verse uh as he says the we
[36:12] we made known unto you the power and the
[36:15] coming so there's three things happening
[36:19] one is something gets made known it has
[36:22] to do with his coming and what it is is
[36:25] there's a power asso iated with his
[36:28] coming that is made known man now it's
[36:31] not just made known doctrinally it's
[36:33] made known
[36:34] experientially amen by experience that
[36:37] Peter had actually experienced it verse
[36:41] 17 for he received from God the Father
[36:44] honor and Glory when there came such a
[36:47] voice to him from the excellent Glory
[36:50] this is my beloved Son in
[36:53] whom I am well
[36:55] pleased so again
[36:58] a voice is coming and the voice is
[37:01] coming with a teaching with a Doctrine
[37:05] this is my beloved Son but with but but
[37:08] the voice is accompanied by a
[37:12] demonstration that Peter is writing
[37:14] about it in a rear saying we were there
[37:17] I saw it yeah I saw a light come down
[37:20] we're not just I'm not just telling you
[37:22] what H I'm not just telling you the the
[37:25] teaching that we learned this is my
[37:27] beloved son but there was actually we
[37:30] experienced that teaching in in real
[37:34] time you got you get me all right Verse
[37:38] 18 and this voice which came from heaven
[37:41] we heard when we were with him in the
[37:44] Holy Mount we have also a more sure word
[37:48] of Prophecy so
[37:51] now so now Peter is
[37:54] saying there was a time back under
[37:58] Isaiah's writings David's writings
[38:00] ezekiel's writings back in Genesis when
[38:03] when the coming of Messiah was foretold
[38:06] job talked about it amen but Peter is
[38:10] saying but now what I'm saying to you is
[38:13] what they had in word only in doctrinal
[38:16] teaching we actually have the experience
[38:20] of that so we have a more sure word than
[38:24] their
[38:25] word because it's been made real To Us
[38:29] by a living experience make sense all
[38:34] right
[38:35] so uh for he re um so um for he received
[38:40] from God the Father honor and Glory when
[38:42] there came such a voice to him from the
[38:43] excellent Glory this is my beloved Son
[38:45] in whom I'm well pleased Verse 18 and
[38:47] this voice which came from heaven we
[38:50] heard when we were with him and the holy
[38:51] Mount 19 we have also a more sure word
[38:55] of Prophecy wherein to
[38:57] ye do well that ye take heed as unto a
[39:02] light that shineth in a dark place until
[39:05] the day Dawn and the day star arise in
[39:08] your heart so you're you've got a
[39:11] journey to take until you say what's
[39:15] where's the journey start in the word
[39:17] where does it where does it Con where
[39:19] does it reach its climax when you've had
[39:21] the experience amen and then what
[39:25] happens when you've had the experience
[39:27] you're the living word amen you see what
[39:30] I'm saying all right until so so you
[39:34] keep journeying in the word until the
[39:38] day star arise in your
[39:40] hearts like it did his like it did ours
[39:43] so do you also
[39:46] amen all right so verse 20 knowing this
[39:50] first that no Prophecy of the scripture
[39:53] is of any private
[39:55] interpretation so it's not about a
[39:57] doctrinal
[39:58] dispute God interprets his word by
[40:02] bringing it to pass you can't tell me
[40:05] there's no New Birth I've had it you
[40:08] can't tell me there's no power in the
[40:09] Holy Ghost I've experienced it see the
[40:12] day dawned in my heart see and now I
[40:16] living in the same power and victory
[40:18] Peter had who was then living in the
[40:20] same power and victory Jesus had make
[40:23] sense all right all right so knowing
[40:28] this so so it's not about a doctrinal
[40:30] dispute no no none of God's word is up
[40:33] to you to determine what it means god
[40:36] interprets it brother random said it
[40:38] over and over again God does not need
[40:40] anybody to interpret his word see as far
[40:43] as a doctrinal um laying it out
[40:46] doctrinally brother brandham went to the
[40:48] scripture and said God gives his word to
[40:49] His prophets and they give it to the
[40:52] people and it's thus sayith the Lord and
[40:55] when you follow thus sayith the Lord you
[40:57] get the
[40:59] Lord amen amen so you become an
[41:04] extension of the Lord by following thus
[41:08] sayeth the Lord which comes only through
[41:10] a prophet and Le and that word leads you
[41:13] to an experience amen all right knowing
[41:17] this first that no Prophecy of the
[41:19] scripture is of any private
[41:21] interpretation for the prophecy came not
[41:24] in old times in Old Time by the will of
[41:27] man
[41:27] but holy men of God spake as they were
[41:30] moved by the Holy Ghost so Peter is
[41:34] simply saying you know these these men
[41:38] of old they didn't come up with what
[41:42] they were going to say on their own so
[41:45] it's so so don't you come up with an
[41:49] interpretation on your own they were
[41:52] moved on by the Holy Spirit you'll have
[41:54] to be moved on by the holy spirit all
[41:57] right
[41:57] let's pray father we thank you for the
[42:01] rapid uh anointing that we feel and the
[42:04] teacher is certainly here today so we
[42:06] thank you for this and now Lord I just
[42:09] relax myself and in your presence humble
[42:12] myself before your presence Lord you be
[42:14] our instructor and teacher today make it
[42:16] real to us Lord these are perilous times
[42:20] that we live in and we we must see your
[42:23] Movement we were invited to see every
[42:26] time a seal is open open the invitation
[42:28] comes from the anointing that beast
[42:30] power come and see so Lord we're here
[42:33] today to see what it is you want us to
[42:35] see I pray that you'll uh give us isav
[42:39] Lord and open up our understanding give
[42:41] us hearing Hearts today to your word to
[42:43] believe every word and to walk forward
[42:46] according to thus sayeth the Lord we
[42:47] commit it to you to you alone in Jesus
[42:50] name amen God bless you as you're seated
[43:12] I love how the
[43:15] Lord Works in such a flow and and you
[43:19] know you're there there's no way to to
[43:22] make sense of all of the word of God
[43:25] outside of the spirit's teaching in you
[43:27] believe that you've got to have it
[43:29] friends we've demonstrated before that
[43:34] while it's true that there are things in
[43:38] God's word in this Bible and of course
[43:41] all of it's true and there are parts of
[43:44] it quite a lot of the parts of it that
[43:47] are accessible to students uh make sure
[43:51] you set up and pay attention don't be
[43:53] dozing or sleeping on me amen amen I'm
[43:56] just not getting started so so so we
[44:00] find that that there are numerous Parts
[44:04] in this book that students comparing
[44:08] verse with verse can decipher it's not
[44:12] difficult brother brandham talking about
[44:14] even the water baptism and he says you
[44:17] don't even need a revelation for water
[44:20] baptism if you can just read see and if
[44:23] you can't read have somebody read it to
[44:25] you it's comp apprehendable in a human
[44:29] just in a human sense without any divine
[44:32] intervention either you read it and you
[44:34] believe it and you emulate it or you
[44:36] won't see and and so on that day there
[44:40] there won't be anyone who can stand and
[44:43] say well I didn't follow it because I
[44:45] didn't understand it the Bible said
[44:48] there is not another name given under
[44:51] Heaven whereby men can be saved other
[44:54] than in the name of the Lord Jesus
[44:55] Christ so when you're B so this is why
[44:58] brother brandham on the authority of
[44:59] that could say if you if you've not been
[45:03] baptized in that name if you've been
[45:04] baptized in those titles you need to
[45:07] come and be re-baptized you understand
[45:10] so this is what the Holy Spirit does he
[45:12] leads people and guides people to all
[45:15] truth and and this why we brother
[45:17] Brandon would say there is no salvation
[45:20] in any other name because that's the
[45:21] scripture so you can't you can't get
[45:24] your way there uh using titles man you
[45:28] know that man has what man did is he
[45:30] went down into the ages and he started
[45:34] interpreting the scripture without the
[45:37] Holy Ghost without the spirit and that
[45:39] caused every denomination we have
[45:42] because it's it's it's students of the
[45:45] scripture comparing verse with verse you
[45:48] say well you know that should be a good
[45:50] system well if it's a good system then
[45:53] why do I have north of 33,000 different
[45:57] denominational interpretations of the
[46:00] Gospel there's only one the gospel
[46:03] that's see and I want the gospel I don't
[46:07] want another version of The Gospel you
[46:10] know and and this is what Paul feared
[46:12] Paul feared that that people would
[46:14] follow with Jesus that he had not
[46:17] preached because Christ is the gospel
[46:20] that's the message that's the good news
[46:22] see and so we realize then that that the
[46:26] the idea of using students comparing
[46:30] verse with verse Works to a degree you
[46:33] can understand water baptism you can
[46:36] understand how that husbands ought to
[46:38] love their wives Paul Paul gives you
[46:40] very clear unambiguous instructions do
[46:43] it like Christ did it's pretty easy I
[46:46] can read the life of Jesus I can I know
[46:48] what he's done for me I can treat my
[46:50] wife like he treats me that's not hard
[46:53] to figure out I can read in the Bible
[46:55] that I you know how
[46:57] how you know the different offices work
[46:59] and what they're called and how they
[47:01] operate I can understand how not to not
[47:03] to provoke my children and and I can
[47:06] understand you know all kinds of various
[47:09] things about the word of God I can
[47:12] understand that you know the the the the
[47:14] principles certain certain principles of
[47:16] marriage and divorce I can understand
[47:18] how churches ought to operate but but
[47:22] then there's a a part of the scripture
[47:25] and when I say parts of the scripture
[47:28] there is there are Parts all through it
[47:30] that are open to human understanding
[47:33] here's a part there's a part there's
[47:34] another part there's another part and
[47:35] you can get a whole bucket full of Parts
[47:39] but but we find that from the first page
[47:42] of Genesis to the last page of
[47:44] Revelation there is an overarching
[47:47] revelation of Christ and and and Christ
[47:52] working in a Plan of Redemption and that
[47:56] that's the part that is sealed away from
[47:59] students comparing verse with verse they
[48:02] might can put together some of the
[48:04] mechanics of it they can understand
[48:06] about Jesus of Nazareth and they can
[48:09] understand about how to believe on him
[48:11] and they can understand you know you
[48:13] you'd think they'd understand how to
[48:14] baptize they largely get it wrong and so
[48:17] if they get something that easy so wrong
[48:20] at such scale then why would we trust
[48:23] man-made Theory to interpret a book
[48:26] that's locked out to students and can
[48:29] only be revealed by the spirit of God
[48:32] that's why it's called a mystery of
[48:35] redemption amen the only one that can
[48:39] reveal to you the mystery of redemption
[48:43] According To Jesus is the holy spirit
[48:47] he's the only one who can unlock it to
[48:50] you you can read the you can read
[48:53] chapter and verse and you know there are
[48:56] certain minations who Pride themselves
[48:58] we We've ran into it here locally well
[49:01] they Pride themselves in being able to
[49:04] say chapter and verse they can tell you
[49:06] the chapter and the verse and quote you
[49:07] the verse and they can go to another
[49:09] chapter and verse and if you make a
[49:11] statement they'll say chapter and verse
[49:13] now they don't like having that said to
[49:15] them because I've did it I flipped it
[49:16] back before and you know I you know I
[49:19] got challenged you know chapter and
[49:21] verse where what's this nonsense about
[49:24] Cain being the son of the serpent
[49:26] chapter and verse and so I did we took a
[49:28] whole meeting with them and I showed
[49:30] them chapter and verse and then they
[49:34] their man got up and said it's obvious
[49:36] that Cain uh that that Abel it's obvious
[49:40] that Abel got his understanding of the
[49:43] lamb from his father Adam to which I
[49:46] then said chapter and
[49:51] verse where's that in the Bible and why
[49:54] was why is God Prejudice and gave it
[49:56] abble not
[49:57] Cain why why is Adam I mean to say why
[50:00] would Adam be favoring one son over
[50:02] another son the whole thing is nonsense
[50:05] and so you you find that it takes the
[50:08] spirit's re revealing to reveal to you
[50:12] not just the letter not just the
[50:15] mechanic of the of the correct teaching
[50:19] even if you have the correct teaching
[50:23] brother Brandon went on to say Satan
[50:26] doesn't care how religious you
[50:29] are see so a lot of times I care whether
[50:34] you're in church or not Satan don't
[50:36] really care you can be here or not he
[50:37] doesn't care you could be here every
[50:38] service he doesn't care that's not that
[50:41] doesn't worry him worries me if you're
[50:42] not here doesn't worry the devil and and
[50:45] and he said Satan doesn't even care how
[50:49] right you are in your Doctrine so even
[50:51] if you have all of the letter of the
[50:54] doctrine correct you have have not
[50:57] troubled there's still nothing about you
[50:59] that worries the
[51:00] devil you understand you come to church
[51:03] you have the correct understanding he's
[51:05] still not afraid of you in the slightest
[51:07] he doesn't lose any sleep over you but
[51:10] what he fears is that the holy spirit
[51:12] will make it real to you and you'll get
[51:15] a new birth and you'll come to a new
[51:18] understanding by experiencing the word
[51:21] of God now he's afraid of
[51:24] you see he wasn't it it it it wasn't
[51:27] about why did he fear Paul but he didn't
[51:30] fear the seven sons of ska because they
[51:33] both had a correct understanding but one
[51:36] had an experiential experience and had
[51:39] power moving with that and the others
[51:41] didn't the others went to church the
[51:43] others knew the word they knew the
[51:46] promises in the word of God they had
[51:47] heard Paul's
[51:49] lessons they were they were good message
[51:52] boys but they had not had an experience
[51:55] of the power of of the Holy Spirit and
[51:58] the devil knew that see Paul I know
[52:02] Jesus I know I don't really know much
[52:04] about you you haven't done very much
[52:06] I've seen you in church I've seen you
[52:08] taking notes I've seen you quoting
[52:10] verses but I still haven't seen that
[52:12] thing I'm afraid of what is it you're
[52:14] afraid of Lucifer I I fear that light
[52:18] I'm always afraid of that light if I
[52:20] don't see that light in you if the day
[52:22] star isn't shining in your heart you
[52:24] don't worry me but if you have the day
[52:27] star shining in your heart me and my
[52:29] demons howl and faint when you walk down
[52:31] the
[52:33] street glory to God you see what I'm
[52:36] saying so so we find then that it takes
[52:40] the Holy Spirit and we showed last time
[52:42] how we were finishing out that all of
[52:45] this began at Calvary from the uh you
[52:49] know from the Creator's view as as as I
[52:52] was saying last time as we were closing
[52:55] out God had went 4,000 years and every
[53:00] man he ever put his hand on failed him
[53:04] in some way from Adam all the way
[53:07] through to the end of the Old Testament
[53:09] even his great warriors of the faith
[53:12] that Paul would place in the Hall of
[53:15] Fame and he would he would place the
[53:18] great warriors of of Abraham and Moses
[53:21] and all the judges and and he would and
[53:24] and when we talk about David we talk
[53:25] about the brave men and brave sisters
[53:27] and and the great exploits that they did
[53:30] but we realize then that that finally by
[53:33] the time he gets down to the era that
[53:36] Jesus came forth on the earth God uh
[53:39] from the from the view of of God he was
[53:42] saying enough was enough and I'm not I'm
[53:45] not going to keep going with
[53:48] this substitute system because this
[53:52] substitute system yes I've got children
[53:56] yes they had the seed Gene of God but I
[53:58] and I could come down upon them and I
[54:00] could anoint them and when I came it
[54:02] down upon Moses they even had to Veil
[54:04] his face and as soon as I left the veil
[54:07] came off and he went just back to a man
[54:09] again and I'm not I don't want to do it
[54:11] that way anymore I don't want to just
[54:13] have a have somebody under my anointing
[54:15] when I anoint them and then when I leave
[54:17] they go back I'm done with that system I
[54:20] I can't redeem my family no matter how
[54:23] good of people they
[54:24] are yes I was quite proud of job and job
[54:28] passed the test but I couldn't redeem it
[54:29] in job Abraham was the father of Faith
[54:32] but I couldn't redeem it in Abraham
[54:34] David was a man after my own heart the
[54:36] apple of my eye but I couldn't redeem
[54:38] Israel uh under David it would have to
[54:41] come one to where God would come down
[54:44] himself and not put his hand on a man
[54:46] but become the man and God himself would
[54:50] Tabernacle himself in flesh and offer
[54:52] his own life as an atonement for his
[54:55] family and now that would make the way
[54:58] what did Calvary finish it calvary
[55:01] finished the purchase Jesus said it's
[55:04] finished the purchase is paid the blood
[55:05] of the Lamb has been paid but now is he
[55:08] finished no did the Rapture come of the
[55:11] Old Testament it did but what about all
[55:13] the New Testament what about you and me
[55:16] Calvary made a way for God to come down
[55:18] and say now enough is enough I'm going
[55:21] to live inside of people I'm going to
[55:25] come inside of I'm going to annihilate
[55:27] their nature and I won't be be there on
[55:29] Sundays and Wednesdays I'll be in there
[55:31] every day when they wake up in the
[55:33] morning when they move through the city
[55:35] when they're at Walmart when they're in
[55:37] the car when they're on the job when
[55:39] they're at church I will be with them
[55:41] and in them and I will abide in them
[55:48] forever they in fact will be a
[55:50] continuation of my
[55:53] Ministry it'll be me multiply
[55:56] yes amen so so this was going to go
[56:00] beyond Israel just as a nation of his
[56:03] servants God was expanding to the next
[56:06] phase of his plan from Genesis as I said
[56:09] to you at the end of last time God was
[56:11] going global yeah amen he wasn't even
[56:15] any longer just going to deal with
[56:17] Israel One Nation dropped down in the
[56:20] midst of all Heathen Nations to be a
[56:22] Shining Light and example to try to
[56:24] teach them the ways of the true God it
[56:27] it it was it was miserably failing
[56:30] brother bam talks about how that when
[56:32] Jesus came on the scene when when you
[56:36] know when when you've got blind Anna
[56:38] walking through the temple when you've
[56:40] got Mary bringing in the babe for you
[56:43] know his dedication when you've got uh
[56:46] Zacharias and and and you've got all
[56:48] these different ones and God is uh
[56:50] talking to the father of John and he's
[56:52] bringing John and all God is just doing
[56:54] all of these different things a whole
[56:56] bunch of stuff is happening
[56:58] simultaneously and brother Brandon makes
[57:00] the point how that by the time he comes
[57:04] to do this really even Israel as a
[57:07] nation had pretty much lost all hope of
[57:11] Messiah amen there were just a very few
[57:15] that really were still longing to see
[57:18] the real thing I'm here to tell you
[57:19] something friends that's the condition
[57:22] of the world today even among
[57:24] Christianity all they have is program
[57:27] and they keep adding to their program
[57:29] they keep trying to recycle it reinvent
[57:32] themselves and let's build a bigger
[57:33] building let's do it different let's
[57:34] have this program let's have that
[57:36] program but but the the thought that
[57:39] actually God could come down and live
[57:41] inside of a of a person and literally be
[57:44] the re Reincarnation of Christ moving in
[57:47] the earth and they seem to have lost all
[57:49] hope for that and so they they cast in
[57:51] their lot with a political movement or
[57:54] or this kind of movement or social uh
[57:56] issue I'm here to tell you God was done
[57:59] with that and the bride is done with
[58:01] that and we're looking for the Living
[58:03] God to have living manifestation and
[58:06] it's not too late it's happening now and
[58:09] it's only going to get more and the
[58:10] bride is leaving
[58:12] here we believe that friends we have not
[58:16] followed cunningly devised
[58:19] Tales we have a more sure word of
[58:25] Prophecy John went into the aisle of
[58:28] patmas and wrote about what was coming
[58:31] in our day I can say to John you can say
[58:36] to St John I have a more sure word of
[58:39] Prophecy than
[58:41] you amen saying well I don't know if I
[58:44] have enough courage I don't care whether
[58:46] you have enough courage or not it's true
[58:48] you are now the living experience of
[58:50] what John wrote in the Book of
[58:52] Revelation that nobody clearly
[58:54] understood they didn't understand what
[58:56] it meant when when the age in because if
[58:58] you looked at the leoan church age it
[59:01] ended miserably Christ is put on the
[59:04] outside he's no longer even in the
[59:07] church they're they're blind they're
[59:09] miserable they're poor they're naked
[59:11] they don't even know it they had insult
[59:13] to injury they kick Christ out of the
[59:15] church
[59:17] completely but John saw that in
[59:19] Revelation 4 and in Revelation 5 there
[59:22] was still one seated on the throne and
[59:25] there was one calling for somebody to
[59:26] take the book and loose the seals and
[59:29] redeem the family and we have a more
[59:32] sure word of Prophecy than that today
[59:35] because that book has been open and the
[59:37] seals have been released and I have been
[59:39] brought into the family of God in an age
[59:43] of impossible
[59:45] Darkness
[59:48] impossible sometimes we lose sight of
[59:50] how dark it is brother brandham called
[59:51] it I had never heard this term before
[59:54] brother brandham says in the Great
[59:56] Shining
[59:58] Light we are determined by God's grace
[1:00:01] to preach the gospel and reflect his
[1:00:02] light until he comes now Lord the rest
[1:00:05] is to you we shall Now call these people
[1:00:08] he's going to get ready to do a prayer
[1:00:09] line This is 1957 and may the Holy Ghost
[1:00:13] come to this little Tabernacle and make
[1:00:15] a faith in every heart oh I pray that is
[1:00:18] happening today May the Holy Ghost come
[1:00:20] to this little Tabernacle and make a
[1:00:22] faith in every
[1:00:24] heart as they stand come by here to be
[1:00:27] prayed for may they leave today and do
[1:00:30] like those wise men when they seen the
[1:00:33] star again after the spell of
[1:00:37] darkness is it interesting I I I I
[1:00:40] paused and I said to my wife I said I've
[1:00:42] never heard brother Brandon so
[1:00:46] identify the age that we live in and he
[1:00:49] calls it a spell of
[1:00:54] Darkness it's a fair question to to to
[1:00:59] ask
[1:01:01] how how
[1:01:04] has and how does if you can figure out
[1:01:07] how he does it you can figure out how
[1:01:09] he's done
[1:01:10] it how does Satan
[1:01:13] multiply darkness in the
[1:01:17] Earth because fallen angels have not
[1:01:21] multiplied
[1:01:26] they haven't multiplied you understand
[1:01:29] so how does he multiply Darkness on the
[1:01:32] earth when fallen angels have not
[1:01:34] multiplied how does how does Darkness to
[1:01:38] continue to permeate and
[1:01:43] grow throughout and and and until it
[1:01:45] till we've reached an age where it's now
[1:01:49] influence the whole world yes and it has
[1:01:54] them under a complete deception
[1:01:57] and they're blind and miserable they're
[1:02:00] miserable poor and naked they're
[1:02:02] wretched but the blindness brother
[1:02:04] brandham said is the most most saddest
[1:02:07] part it's the saddest part because they
[1:02:10] don't they are all of those things but
[1:02:12] they don't they don't see that and in
[1:02:15] fact is they see just the opposite they
[1:02:17] say no what are you talking about poor
[1:02:19] I'm rich yeah I'm increased with Goods
[1:02:22] I'm wretched I'm naked I have need of
[1:02:25] nothing who are you talking to not me
[1:02:28] see and so but what they don't realize
[1:02:30] is is there's a darkness and Isaiah
[1:02:34] prophesied at the end time that this
[1:02:37] darkness which we've been talking about
[1:02:40] came up out of Genesis when all the way
[1:02:42] to the flood remember we've been
[1:02:43] preaching on it then it went from Noah
[1:02:46] and by the time it got to Jesus it had
[1:02:48] covered the Earth again till even till
[1:02:50] it was so dark by the time Jesus
[1:02:53] ministry is on the scene that they do
[1:02:56] the unthinkable brother brandham said
[1:02:59] they the most holy people they the most
[1:03:02] holy city They Crucified the most
[1:03:05] horrible death the Son of God the most
[1:03:08] blessed
[1:03:09] person there they crucified him there in
[1:03:14] Jerusalem the most holy city they God's
[1:03:18] chosen people crucified the most
[1:03:20] horrible death to he the most beautiful
[1:03:25] person who had ever lived in the Earth
[1:03:28] how did it get to that point and I'm
[1:03:30] here to tell you that that that repeats
[1:03:33] at the end time and that's why a prophet
[1:03:35] would say I indict this generation for
[1:03:38] the second crucifixion because now it's
[1:03:40] not just Jerusalem and Israel doing it
[1:03:43] it's the whole world the entire
[1:03:45] Christianity the entire Christian world
[1:03:48] all 33,000 of them by rejecting Christ
[1:03:52] the word have crucified a friend
[1:03:59] so I don't I shouldn't have to spend a
[1:04:02] lot of time con you know convincing you
[1:04:06] that darkness is even greater now than
[1:04:09] when it was in the days of
[1:04:12] Jesus when there they crucified him now
[1:04:16] it's Global God went Global why did it
[1:04:18] Go Global because it was going to be a
[1:04:20] global bride whose names were in the
[1:04:22] Lamb's Book of Life and he would take
[1:04:24] 2,000 years years he would take 20
[1:04:28] centuries to fill up the role of all of
[1:04:31] those names in the Lamb's Book of Life
[1:04:33] That's why every age has had a message
[1:04:36] and a messenger that's why your age had
[1:04:38] a messenger and its message that's why
[1:04:40] you are believers you are the message
[1:04:43] made life made flesh made real it's not
[1:04:47] just Doctrine it's a
[1:04:48] life Satan's not afraid of Doctrine he's
[1:04:51] afraid of life
[1:04:56] so we find then that that's why Isaiah
[1:04:59] would
[1:04:59] say concerning the end time now you can
[1:05:03] see that because it's Isaiah
[1:05:06] 60 and it's a rise Shine for thy light
[1:05:09] is come and Gentiles will come to the
[1:05:11] brightness of thy Rising so clearly an
[1:05:13] end time prophecy and and Isaiah is
[1:05:17] saying that by the time you get to this
[1:05:19] point where you have a light shining in
[1:05:22] darkness till the day Dawn and the day
[1:05:25] start our rise so now we're not just
[1:05:27] talking about individual now we're
[1:05:30] talking about global there would come a
[1:05:32] day when it would be Darkness over the
[1:05:34] whole earth here it is I can't say it
[1:05:36] simpler than this it would get down to
[1:05:38] the end time and it wouldn't just be
[1:05:40] Darkness but it would be gross Darkness
[1:05:43] on the people it wouldn't just be Israel
[1:05:46] killing Christ it would be the whole
[1:05:48] world crucifying the word it would be a
[1:05:52] time unique from every other age when it
[1:05:54] would be grow Darkness on the people to
[1:05:57] where they would think that they're rich
[1:05:59] and increase with goods and have need of
[1:06:01] nothing when they actually have nothing
[1:06:03] amen imagine thinking you have need of
[1:06:06] nothing when you have
[1:06:07] nothing and that's that's the level of
[1:06:10] deception that we are living in and and
[1:06:13] now we're speaking on now we're speaking
[1:06:15] to the age now there's prophesied a day
[1:06:19] star would rise again Isaiah said
[1:06:21] Isaiah's language was that arise Shine
[1:06:25] the th light shall come that's why a
[1:06:27] prophet could come to the pull pit only
[1:06:29] after the opening of the seals and he
[1:06:31] could say it is the rising of the Sun
[1:06:35] and we have come to that Rising the day
[1:06:37] star has dawned in our
[1:06:41] age so it's brought an end of Darkness
[1:06:44] to the world no the world is darker than
[1:06:46] it's ever been but it brought an end of
[1:06:48] Darkness to the when God was filling up
[1:06:51] the role of all of those names in the
[1:06:53] Lamb's Book of Life I'm here to tell you
[1:06:55] something for uh friends the Bible says
[1:06:57] you shall come forth shining in his
[1:06:59] strength you'll be the light of the
[1:07:01] world shining in the strength of Christ
[1:07:04] himself this I'm G to tell you when God
[1:07:06] was done God was done uh there at
[1:07:09] Calvary he was he was he was finished
[1:07:12] with that system and the bride at the
[1:07:14] last day the spirit and the bride say
[1:07:16] come because why she is also done with
[1:07:20] man-made Theory and she's done with
[1:07:23] man-made ideology she's done with being
[1:07:26] hemmed in and trapped and boxed in and
[1:07:28] she can't have the power of God nonsense
[1:07:30] I'm done with that we have the power of
[1:07:32] God moving in our homes moving in our
[1:07:37] lives it's not just dry word it's the
[1:07:41] spirit that gives
[1:07:45] life so the Bible then so then it comes
[1:07:49] back to our
[1:07:51] question how does Satan multiply how has
[1:07:54] he been so successful
[1:07:57] and in fact
[1:07:58] is he has been more
[1:08:02] successful since Jesus died at
[1:08:06] Calvary he has been more successful
[1:08:11] since the seven sealed book was
[1:08:13] opened when When Jesus ascended on high
[1:08:18] and sent his life back into the church
[1:08:20] that didn't convert the
[1:08:22] world the world got darker still yes and
[1:08:27] it that it would get so it would it
[1:08:29] would get so dark after the upper room
[1:08:33] experience that even history theologians
[1:08:38] even brother brandham would call it the
[1:08:41] Dark
[1:08:44] Ages
[1:08:46] amen so and Isaiah would say it'll be
[1:08:49] dark and then it'll get finally get
[1:08:51] gross Darkness on the whole people so we
[1:08:54] realize then that how has this happened
[1:08:57] you would think that that that since the
[1:08:59] seals were open the world would start to
[1:09:02] turn around no sir the the gospel and
[1:09:05] I've said this before I want to say it
[1:09:07] again the gospel did not come to save
[1:09:12] the
[1:09:14] world the gospel is freely offered to
[1:09:17] anyone in the world but the same Jesus
[1:09:20] that sent his disciples out with the
[1:09:22] gospel prophesied in Matthew 24 in other
[1:09:25] places that it wouldn't be received it
[1:09:27] would get darker and worse and worse and
[1:09:29] the whole world would go into complete
[1:09:32] apostasy so it's not like Jesus is
[1:09:35] standing here today saying man I thought
[1:09:38] I had a locktite plan I can't believe
[1:09:41] it's got to this boy I just knew if I
[1:09:44] came down and lived out my life and gave
[1:09:46] my blood and then I sent back my life
[1:09:48] into the church and my goodness if they
[1:09:50] if if just the shadow of Peter could
[1:09:52] heal people and and and if they could
[1:09:54] have the power of God and and even that
[1:09:56] put him in prison and an angel would get
[1:09:58] him out and open the doors and drop the
[1:10:00] shackles it it doesn't doesn't matter
[1:10:02] what I've done and and and and and and
[1:10:05] you'd think that the whole world would
[1:10:06] have been converted not only is that not
[1:10:08] true but it's actually uh gotten
[1:10:13] worse amen but I'm here to tell you the
[1:10:16] Lord Jesus isn't standing here ringing
[1:10:18] his hands saying I don't know I'm it's
[1:10:21] so bad now I maybe I've waited too long
[1:10:24] maybe I should have I should have went
[1:10:26] ahead and had the Rapture years ago
[1:10:29] because now the world is darkness and
[1:10:31] gross Darkness over the whole people and
[1:10:33] the whole world now the scripture says
[1:10:35] their tables are filled with vomit yeah
[1:10:38] and and now you've got the days of of
[1:10:40] Noah and the days of lot like a double
[1:10:43] barrel shotgun and we're having to live
[1:10:45] under that now you've got a day when
[1:10:48] Satan himself has been elected by the
[1:10:51] popular vote as the god of the evil age
[1:10:54] and it's on both sides of the aisle
[1:10:56] right amen now he's the God of this evil
[1:11:00] age now he's had 6,000 years God is God
[1:11:04] might be saying gee I took 6,000 years
[1:11:06] to build my Eden and he broke it I I
[1:11:08] probably shouldn't have given him 6,000
[1:11:10] years because now he's built his Eden
[1:11:12] now it's it's a Darkness at a scale
[1:11:16] unprecedented it's Darkness at a scale
[1:11:18] unequaled unparalleled I may have waited
[1:11:21] too long it's now too evil if I couldn't
[1:11:24] get my bride out then how am I going to
[1:11:26] get her out now don't worry Hallelujah
[1:11:28] don't worry because arise shine thy
[1:11:32] light has
[1:11:35] come and we as kings and the sons of a
[1:11:38] king king's sons and daughters have come
[1:11:42] to the brightness of that
[1:11:45] rising and how do I know that I found
[1:11:48] the true anointing because the life of
[1:11:51] this lives inside me and the same love I
[1:11:54] I I I I find that when I go through his
[1:11:57] word It's Made Real to me and I even the
[1:12:00] parts that take my hide off and tell me
[1:12:02] I need to change this and I need to
[1:12:04] change that and the world would say
[1:12:06] you're crazy you should be you do you be
[1:12:09] be who you want to be I say I I don't
[1:12:11] want to be me I I'm tired of being me I
[1:12:13] want to be him Hallelujah
[1:12:17] friends he has filled the
[1:12:23] role so and Angels haven't
[1:12:28] multiplied and yet the Bible describes
[1:12:32] the world as getting progressively
[1:12:35] darker yeah until it becomes gross
[1:12:40] darkness and
[1:12:42] Satan you know here here's something to
[1:12:45] understand and and this is this this
[1:12:48] this Bears out in
[1:12:51] sociology
[1:12:53] culture is derived
[1:12:56] over a three to five generation it's
[1:12:58] anywhere from 60 to 150
[1:13:01] years and you can have a certain culture
[1:13:04] that's
[1:13:05] Global but sociology teaches us that
[1:13:09] that if if you have a a change agent a
[1:13:12] movement starts and that movement at
[1:13:16] first it's
[1:13:17] repudiated at first it's like no that
[1:13:19] ain't how we do things no you're you're
[1:13:22] deceiver you're you're that's not that's
[1:13:24] not
[1:13:25] accurate and and then and then by the
[1:13:28] second generation it's like well okay
[1:13:32] you know you be you will be us and then
[1:13:35] by the third generation people are
[1:13:37] starting to go you know maybe hey maybe
[1:13:39] we should look at this again let's this
[1:13:41] not all be you know think we're always
[1:13:43] right maybe there's something to this
[1:13:45] and then by the time you get to the
[1:13:46] fourth generation it's a totally
[1:13:48] accepted
[1:13:50] Norm
[1:13:51] amen we can see that in the in the AG of
[1:13:55] today oh yeah you you can see say oh
[1:13:58] well but there's been a a big
[1:14:00] repudiation you know we we elected our
[1:14:03] Superman we we're repudiating all of
[1:14:05] that woke nonsense don't think you've
[1:14:06] cured the world don't think you've even
[1:14:09] cured this nation I'm here to tell you
[1:14:12] this nation and the entire world are
[1:14:14] still steeped in darkness on both sides
[1:14:16] of the aisle and none of them are
[1:14:18] willing to accept the Judgment from
[1:14:20] Heaven none of them are willing to
[1:14:22] accept that voice they're all they're
[1:14:24] they're are all failing to catch the
[1:14:26] voice in the East Wind and the and and
[1:14:29] and enormous and horrible judgments are
[1:14:32] rushing to meet us and I'm here to tell
[1:14:34] you the only way out is
[1:14:36] up and and that's what happened to the
[1:14:38] bride at the end of leoda at the end of
[1:14:41] the last Church age the church goes into
[1:14:44] the tribulation and the bride goes into
[1:14:49] Rapture so you you have this you know
[1:14:52] you and now history is replete with that
[1:14:55] with many examples I mean for
[1:14:58] years you know you you they they taught
[1:15:01] well you know the World is Flat and they
[1:15:04] had scientists who thought that and then
[1:15:08] and then and then they had scientists
[1:15:09] who taught here's another one they
[1:15:12] taught that the Earth was the center of
[1:15:14] the
[1:15:15] universe and then the church got on and
[1:15:17] then political and religious joined
[1:15:19] together and then if you said the Earth
[1:15:22] wasn't the center they would put you to
[1:15:24] death
[1:15:26] now that worked for hundreds of years
[1:15:27] now that didn't you know what done that
[1:15:29] generational now how did we get that
[1:15:30] change you had men like cernus men like
[1:15:33] Galileo and they started coming up
[1:15:35] looking through their telescopes going
[1:15:37] uh guys we got a
[1:15:38] problem and they started saying you know
[1:15:40] we may not actually be the center of the
[1:15:43] universe looks like it's bigger than we
[1:15:45] thought it was and when they first
[1:15:47] started to do that I mean Galileo was
[1:15:49] almost killed for that he actually had
[1:15:51] to kind of repent and write out a little
[1:15:53] fake apology to the pope you know and
[1:15:57] and yeah and so and so but finally then
[1:15:59] by the Next Generation and then you you
[1:16:01] know you've got the reformation and you
[1:16:03] then you're going to have the
[1:16:04] Renaissance and then you're going to
[1:16:05] have the Great Awakening and science is
[1:16:07] going to start to pick up speed and two
[1:16:09] or three generations after that 60 to
[1:16:12] 150 years now by that time 150 years
[1:16:14] later everybody knows the Earth is not
[1:16:16] the center of the
[1:16:17] universe you had that in the church
[1:16:20] where the Deeds of the nicians yeah
[1:16:23] right and and we find out that they had
[1:16:26] the doctrine of balum they had the Deeds
[1:16:27] of the nians and and brother brandham
[1:16:29] goes back to church history to show to
[1:16:31] say listen it's you know it just started
[1:16:33] out as a little saying yeah that's right
[1:16:36] that the church wouldn't no we don't
[1:16:38] believe that what are you talking about
[1:16:39] nanism no we're against that oh well I'm
[1:16:42] just saying you know maybe don't you
[1:16:43] think we need to have a little bit of
[1:16:45] order to things we seem just a little
[1:16:47] scattered here and you know we were all
[1:16:49] piled up in Jerusalem and then
[1:16:50] persecution came we got scattered to the
[1:16:52] world we we had sold all of our houses
[1:16:54] and everything so we could all live
[1:16:56] common and now we got
[1:16:58] nothing amen remember the Theologian who
[1:17:01] interrupted brother brandham sermon said
[1:17:03] brother brandham said that was the
[1:17:05] greatest mistake the church ever made
[1:17:06] when they did that and brother brandham
[1:17:08] said the Holy Ghost make a mistake kind
[1:17:11] of preacher are
[1:17:12] you you don't need to understand it God
[1:17:15] Don't Make Mistakes you don't it's not
[1:17:18] about can you create a mathematical
[1:17:20] equation and say I was better I was
[1:17:22] worse that has God doesn't operate that
[1:17:24] way God is looking long range he knows
[1:17:27] what's best for you he knows what's best
[1:17:29] for me sometimes he we lose things to
[1:17:32] gain better
[1:17:35] things sometimes like job we do
[1:17:37] everything right and everything turns
[1:17:39] out
[1:17:41] wrong this is why our faith in Christ
[1:17:43] has to exceed our understanding of
[1:17:45] events your faith in Christ has to
[1:17:48] exceed the the pitfalls and ups and
[1:17:50] downs of your own life your faith has to
[1:17:53] exceed your failures and say but I still
[1:17:55] love him and I still believe him and
[1:17:57] I'll repent and I believe he forgives me
[1:18:00] well he forgave you last week he'll do
[1:18:02] it again this week he'll forgive me
[1:18:04] tomorrow and the next day and the next
[1:18:06] day because I am part of
[1:18:12] him so it actually you know all satan
[1:18:16] had to
[1:18:17] do in the Garden of Eden to permeate the
[1:18:21] Earth with
[1:18:22] Darkness even though the Fallen Angels
[1:18:25] multiply all he had to do was pollute
[1:18:29] the first
[1:18:31] generation that was all he had to do
[1:18:33] amen once he polluted that first
[1:18:36] generation those first parents of Adam
[1:18:38] and Eve then every man after that every
[1:18:41] man and woman boy and girl that would
[1:18:43] ever be born would be born in
[1:18:46] darkness and would be born with a fallen
[1:18:49] nature that could not even agree with
[1:18:52] God's
[1:18:53] word and so s then by remember brother
[1:18:56] BR talks about how that a demon spirit
[1:18:58] is almost powerless unless he can get
[1:19:00] someone to work through but you
[1:19:02] understand friends we we went from you
[1:19:05] know two people then we had hundreds
[1:19:08] then we had millions and then God re
[1:19:11] recycled it down to Noah and his family
[1:19:14] and then it wasn't very long after that
[1:19:15] you had a whole tribe of people in the
[1:19:17] valley of Shar building a a a a great uh
[1:19:21] sphere a great Spire a great tower and
[1:19:24] and then you had Babylon come along and
[1:19:26] then you had Nimrod carrying water to
[1:19:28] his neighbors we tracked all of this you
[1:19:30] know uh remember the man who said i'
[1:19:32] I've slown a man I slain a man to my
[1:19:34] wounding if and if and if Cain was this
[1:19:36] this then I'll be seven times that and
[1:19:38] you see it and and it kept kept going
[1:19:40] till finally it got to Noah's day and
[1:19:42] God just had to start all over again and
[1:19:43] then it grew
[1:19:45] again and then it got to Jesus day and
[1:19:48] that nation that crucified the word was
[1:19:51] destroyed and
[1:19:52] Scattered but did that stop St the devil
[1:19:55] the darkness kept growing but then the
[1:19:57] day of Pentecost uh illuminated some
[1:19:59] people but the darkness kept
[1:20:01] growing and we went from you know two to
[1:20:05] 100 to a th000 to 10,000 to 10 million
[1:20:09] to a billion to two billion to four
[1:20:11] billion to six billion 8 billion 8 and a
[1:20:14] half billion soon to be 9 billion and
[1:20:17] every time a hospital announces a little
[1:20:20] baby and they write a little new birth
[1:20:22] certificate Satan's influence is pro
[1:20:25] proactively growing throughout the Earth
[1:20:27] he didn't need for a fallen spirits to
[1:20:30] multiply all he had to do was break that
[1:20:32] first generation do you see why God had
[1:20:35] to take us back to the original word
[1:20:38] once you break it in any way then it all
[1:20:40] it does is perpetuate more darkness and
[1:20:43] more darkness and more Darkness but
[1:20:45] arise shine thy light has come the day
[1:20:49] star has arisen in our
[1:20:53] lives now we've come to the end of
[1:20:56] Darkness the day star has risen and
[1:21:00] there is a bride on the earth who is now
[1:21:03] the living Tabernacle of the living
[1:21:06] God's presence Hallelujah the world
[1:21:09] continues in its
[1:21:12] Darkness let's have my PowerPoint
[1:21:14] brother
[1:21:19] Josh I'm going to take this as
[1:21:22] I as I continue on and come to the
[1:21:26] close so the bride's
[1:21:29] time in the ages now that's an
[1:21:34] intentional the bride's
[1:21:36] time the reason I choose that is because
[1:21:40] brother Brenham hear me clearly brother
[1:21:44] Brenham interchanged almost
[1:21:49] equally bride's
[1:21:51] time with the bride age right
[1:21:55] with the Harvest
[1:21:57] Time so the bride Age The Bride time the
[1:22:01] Harvest time is all the same thing amen
[1:22:05] you understand so the bride age was
[1:22:08] never to be thought of as an eighth
[1:22:12] age it is a it is a time of the Bride
[1:22:16] within the last part of the last
[1:22:19] age after Christ has been put out then
[1:22:22] we have the word and the word only now
[1:22:26] there's there's two things that have
[1:22:27] happened to us sadly because as soon as
[1:22:31] people understood it as an eighth age
[1:22:34] then then you had all of these eighth
[1:22:36] age Messengers jumping up to elect
[1:22:39] themselves as the continuation of
[1:22:41] brother bram's
[1:22:42] Ministry and you've had this camp and
[1:22:44] that camp and this camp and that camp
[1:22:46] and this holy man and that holy man and
[1:22:47] this great gift and that great ministry
[1:22:48] in this and it's all these Kingdom
[1:22:51] building Ministries who who who thought
[1:22:54] that the bride age is a is something new
[1:22:57] it's an eighth it's back to the Eternal
[1:22:59] well absolutely the word has come back
[1:23:02] to its Eighth Day that's what the
[1:23:04] opening of the seals is all about it's
[1:23:06] absolutely true that in my soul I'm I'm
[1:23:09] already sitting in Heavenly places in
[1:23:11] Christ Jesus but this body's still
[1:23:14] here amen this body is not in its
[1:23:17] Eternal day I mean people say oh we're
[1:23:19] in the Millennium now well if it is can
[1:23:21] I please have my money back
[1:23:24] because I'm quite disappointed if this
[1:23:26] is the
[1:23:27] Millennium but this is not the
[1:23:29] Millennium Hallelujah at best this is
[1:23:31] Purgatory I'm standing between Heaven
[1:23:33] and Hell and Hell has come to the
[1:23:35] surface and demon powers are streaming
[1:23:37] into the Earth but arise shine thy light
[1:23:40] has come am
[1:23:43] amen so you either had eighth age
[1:23:47] ministers jumping on board to say I'm
[1:23:49] the guy it's fine until guy number one
[1:23:52] starts arguing with guy number two and
[1:23:55] Guy number three who lives in another
[1:23:56] continent argues with guy number two and
[1:23:58] says guy number one's an idiot then guy
[1:24:00] number four says you're all three stupid
[1:24:01] I'm the
[1:24:04] man I I I started to I started to play
[1:24:07] it you know here uh I had a clip I
[1:24:11] played for my Ministry team and it was
[1:24:14] it went back to
[1:24:16] 1997 and it was in their annual isua
[1:24:19] Revival meeting that's what they call it
[1:24:22] 1997 and so you're going back decades
[1:24:25] and one of their their keynote speakers
[1:24:27] and you got all of these these
[1:24:29] Pentecostals by denomination not by
[1:24:32] experience but by denomination and I
[1:24:35] hope God I'm I'm quite sure God has
[1:24:37] brought many of them out brother Ernie
[1:24:39] was trapped in stuff like that till he
[1:24:41] come out there's been lots of people who
[1:24:43] were brought out brought into the into
[1:24:45] the uh Shining Light amen they they they
[1:24:48] came under the glow of the day star and
[1:24:50] they came out of her my people amen but
[1:24:53] even even
[1:24:54] 1997 all of those decades ago and this
[1:24:59] man starts preaching and the people are
[1:25:02] on their feet they're rejoicing you can
[1:25:04] hear shouts of amen and and little did
[1:25:08] that preacher know at that time
[1:25:10] 1997 it was just a drop in the
[1:25:15] bucket he had no clue of how it would
[1:25:18] burgeon into our day to where it is so
[1:25:21] such a large thing it has taken over
[1:25:23] Christianity
[1:25:25] completely except for among the bride at
[1:25:27] least that's where it shouldn't be and
[1:25:29] he he starts talking about the the the
[1:25:32] music industry and he he and he starts I
[1:25:34] I I probably should have played it but
[1:25:36] he starts talking about he says you know
[1:25:38] today we've got we we've got secular
[1:25:42] people singing Christian songs and we
[1:25:43] got Christian people singing secular
[1:25:46] songs and and and and we've got we've
[1:25:48] got preachers acting like motivational
[1:25:50] speakers and we got motivational
[1:25:51] speakers acting like preachers and we
[1:25:53] got prophets acting like acting like
[1:25:55] psych psychics and psychics acting like
[1:25:58] prophets and the church is just going in
[1:25:59] a circle and in a circle she don't even
[1:26:01] know what to do or where to go I'm glad
[1:26:04] God called us out of that I'm glad today
[1:26:07] that we see the Glorious light that's
[1:26:10] shining Hallelujah we have not followed
[1:26:14] cunningly devised Tales we have received
[1:26:16] the engrafted word
[1:26:19] hallelujah and so so you find then that
[1:26:23] that we have too many who tried to you
[1:26:26] know jump and say I'm this one I'm that
[1:26:28] one and then then the next Pitfall we
[1:26:33] ran into was people misunderstanding a
[1:26:37] couple of things a prophet said he first
[1:26:39] says you know that you can't mix
[1:26:42] Pentecost with this message and
[1:26:46] somehow I mean it it it takes my breath
[1:26:49] away but somehow they imagine that
[1:26:52] brother Brandon meant the original Upper
[1:26:53] Room
[1:26:54] experience in Jerusalem that you can't
[1:26:58] mix this message with the upper room
[1:27:00] experience The Upper Room experience was
[1:27:02] the message is the message it's the
[1:27:06] Jubilee it's the long awaited Jubilee
[1:27:10] the Earth had been waiting for for 4,000
[1:27:11] years it was all through the te the Old
[1:27:14] Testament from Genesis on about how God
[1:27:16] would finally be able to not just dwell
[1:27:18] above or dwell with but he would dwell
[1:27:22] inside this was the long awaited Jubilee
[1:27:25] this was the power of God under
[1:27:27] salvation this was the living
[1:27:30] experience that's what that and I'm I'm
[1:27:32] going to show you here an example just
[1:27:33] in a
[1:27:35] minute and and so not realizing that
[1:27:38] brother Brandon was simply
[1:27:39] meaning that pent you can't mix this
[1:27:42] message with
[1:27:44] Pentecostalism meaning the
[1:27:46] denominations that the isua revivalist
[1:27:50] became the isua Revival was a part of
[1:27:53] the restoration of the brid tree it's
[1:27:55] part three of a four-face plan amen so
[1:27:59] so God was using it and just like Luther
[1:28:02] it was that brother brandham typed it to
[1:28:04] a wheat plant so like Luther is a stalk
[1:28:07] and when they denominated and the light
[1:28:09] moved on to the tassel the stalk became
[1:28:11] a dry stalk and there was no more life
[1:28:14] in it all the life had moved into
[1:28:16] Wesley's day and then when Wesley's day
[1:28:18] passed and the isua Revival started it
[1:28:21] went into what looked like the seed and
[1:28:23] the tassel went dry but then we found
[1:28:26] out that it actually wasn't the seed it
[1:28:29] was a shock that looked like the seed
[1:28:32] now we're not saying that the isua
[1:28:35] revivalists those great warriors of the
[1:28:37] faith back there oh they're just a shook
[1:28:40] well the age turned out to be that no no
[1:28:44] more than I would say oh John Wesley
[1:28:46] he's just a dried up
[1:28:47] tassel not insulting that that's that
[1:28:50] that truth is not to insult John or
[1:28:52] insult the azuza Revival it's not to
[1:28:55] insult Luther brother Ramon don't say he
[1:28:56] didn't have the Holy Ghost he did but
[1:28:59] we're talking about the full measure of
[1:29:01] the token and the full measure of the
[1:29:04] token has always been parallel and
[1:29:06] tantamount to the level of revelation of
[1:29:08] the word so they had the full Jubilee
[1:29:11] under a prophet's Ministry in the early
[1:29:13] Church of the alpha age amen that Alpha
[1:29:16] Church they had the Jubilee brother
[1:29:18] brandham said they had the abstract
[1:29:20] title
[1:29:21] deed they had the token they were the
[1:29:24] they were the ministry they not only had
[1:29:26] the office of the son of man in Paul
[1:29:29] they had the ministry of the son of man
[1:29:30] moving in the people why do you think
[1:29:33] Peter's Shadow and people got healed why
[1:29:35] do you think they could go out of jails
[1:29:37] and an angel why do you think they could
[1:29:39] speak
[1:29:40] boldly because they had the full token
[1:29:43] the message of this hour is not another
[1:29:46] gospel it's not an additional gospel
[1:29:48] it's the restoration of that original
[1:29:54] it's not an eighth one we don't need an
[1:29:56] eighth messenger we've come back to the
[1:29:58] full token back to the full abstract and
[1:30:02] when you do that you return back to the
[1:30:04] full power and demonstration of the Holy
[1:30:08] Ghost because the the the other fallacy
[1:30:12] becomes well but brother brandham said
[1:30:14] the word and the word only as if somehow
[1:30:17] he's meaning doctrinal teaching and
[1:30:20] doctrinal teaching only
[1:30:24] not only is that premise not true it has
[1:30:27] never been true in God's elect lady she
[1:30:31] has always had the power and
[1:30:33] demonstration of the Holy Ghost brother
[1:30:35] Brandon proved that in the church Age
[1:30:37] series in the revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:30:39] series and went back to to polycarp and
[1:30:41] irenius and and he he he went between
[1:30:44] those two and he picked irenius and then
[1:30:46] from there he went to uh Martin and then
[1:30:48] from there he went to Columba and then
[1:30:49] from there it came into Sardis and
[1:30:51] Luther and Wesley and it went on and
[1:30:53] brother Brandon went through history and
[1:30:54] showed that the power and demonstration
[1:30:57] of the power of God was alive in every
[1:30:59] Church
[1:31:00] age even when they their Doctrine skewed
[1:31:04] off because they they and because that
[1:31:06] you can't disbelieve what you don't know
[1:31:08] and it wasn't revealed to them there was
[1:31:09] darkness and the and a seal was only
[1:31:11] partially open and and a mystery dropped
[1:31:14] down a messenger caught it partial and
[1:31:16] ran with the partial and the bride
[1:31:18] gathered around the partial it wasn't
[1:31:19] perfect but it gave them the new birth
[1:31:22] they'll be in the first resurrection
[1:31:24] you'll see them at the great table
[1:31:26] you'll sit across from
[1:31:29] them so the word and the word only never
[1:31:32] meant doctrinal teaching and doctrinal
[1:31:35] teaching only we have the word so we
[1:31:37] don't need the power and demonstration
[1:31:38] of the Holy Spirit if you don't have the
[1:31:41] power and demonstration of the Holy
[1:31:43] Spirit you don't have the Living Word
[1:31:45] you've got a dead
[1:31:47] letter because the letter kth it's the
[1:31:49] spirit that giveth life I'm not even
[1:31:53] saying you have any accurate Doctrine
[1:31:54] but the devil don't care how right you
[1:31:57] are in your
[1:31:59] Doctrine it's the life that he's afraid
[1:32:03] of
[1:32:05] see so you know I I have said to I I I I
[1:32:11] was asked one time said no brother we're
[1:32:14] with the opening of the seals we've got
[1:32:16] something more than they
[1:32:18] had and I just said well okay so let's
[1:32:22] just go with that for a minute can you
[1:32:24] answer some questions for me yes sure go
[1:32:26] ahead would you please tell me which
[1:32:30] doctrine that we believe that Paul
[1:32:34] didn't
[1:32:37] teach just name one what a
[1:32:40] baptism the
[1:32:42] godhead think Paul didn't teach on the
[1:32:44] godhead you think he didn't baptize
[1:32:47] those Baptist back there in in Upper
[1:32:49] coast of Ephesus and make them get
[1:32:50] re-baptized you think Paul didn't
[1:32:52] understand marriage and divorce he
[1:32:53] preached on on it you think he didn't
[1:32:55] understand the identity of MDC Paul knew
[1:32:58] so much about mzc he said I can't even
[1:33:00] tell you everything I know you become
[1:33:02] dull of hearing see it was already
[1:33:04] starting to to decline the serpent seed
[1:33:07] the original sin who wh Paul is the one
[1:33:10] who goes to the greatest example of that
[1:33:13] bear with me and indeed bear with me for
[1:33:15] I'm jealous over you with a Godly
[1:33:17] jealousy for I've espoused you to to one
[1:33:19] husband and that's Christ but I fear as
[1:33:20] he was begal so you in the Simplicity of
[1:33:22] your mind
[1:33:24] and and so you realize that he's going
[1:33:26] right back to prove that that whatever
[1:33:28] you want to say of Eve she did not
[1:33:30] remain a faithful wife ESP spouse to one
[1:33:32] husband that's the whole point he's
[1:33:34] making and and and and if you don't
[1:33:36] agree with Paul then what in the world
[1:33:38] is he talking
[1:33:39] about what the the three-phase cycle of
[1:33:42] the Rapture Paul taught
[1:33:45] that we quote Pauls that that that we
[1:33:50] quote the Lord himself shall descend
[1:33:52] from heaven with a shout and the voice
[1:33:54] of the Archangel and the trumpet shall
[1:33:56] sound shall sound the dead in Christ
[1:33:58] shall rise we which alive and remain
[1:34:00] shall be changed in a moment Paul taught
[1:34:02] that
[1:34:04] cycle I mean which which Doctrine
[1:34:07] predestination oh goodness gracious
[1:34:10] election for ordination Paul was
[1:34:14] absolutely the master of it you you
[1:34:17] think you you think you
[1:34:18] can okay let let's play it uh take that
[1:34:22] down I'm uh the booth is dying to let me
[1:34:24] play it so I'm going to play it now
[1:34:26] you're going to read a posting at the
[1:34:29] top and all it says is 1997 30 years ago
[1:34:31] it's relevant today don't get distracted
[1:34:33] by that or you miss what the guy is
[1:34:34] saying all right let's have plenty of
[1:34:36] sound and let me know if you think it is
[1:34:38] still applicable you know world to the
[1:34:40] the lines have become so blurred until
[1:34:42] we got gospel singers singing secular
[1:34:43] music and secular singers singing gospel
[1:34:45] music and preachers looking like
[1:34:47] motivational speakers and motivational
[1:34:49] speakers trying to look like preachers
[1:34:50] and psychics trying to be prophets and
[1:34:52] Prophets acting like psychics and we're
[1:34:54] standing out here in the middle and we
[1:34:55] don't know where to
[1:34:56] [Applause]
[1:35:01] go the gospel music industry is filled
[1:35:04] with singers who have no
[1:35:06] Pastor who do not go to church but they
[1:35:10] have an agent who acts as a pimp to
[1:35:14] prostitute their gift to anybody who
[1:35:16] will pay the right amount of
[1:35:18] money I may never get to come back but
[1:35:21] I'm going to preach tonight
[1:35:22] [Laughter]
[1:35:24] you may not let me come back but I'm
[1:35:26] going to preach
[1:35:27] today that's what we're facing friends
[1:35:30] that's how the world got in the
[1:35:32] condition and that was 30 years ago I'm
[1:35:35] here to tell you something and and his
[1:35:36] cry was we need to come back to the
[1:35:38] truth they didn't it's only gotten worse
[1:35:42] until it's even permeated our ranks and
[1:35:45] sometimes I wonder where what kind of
[1:35:46] songs are we listening to that gets sung
[1:35:49] in the exact way that some secular
[1:35:51] artist sung a gospel song to worldly
[1:35:54] beat and we bring it right into our
[1:35:56] message churches I just say friends we
[1:35:58] need a wholesale repentance of these
[1:35:59] things and come back to the sacredness
[1:36:02] of the true
[1:36:04] word I you know I love powerful music
[1:36:07] Don't you'll never accuse me of that
[1:36:09] everybody knows brother Jason I Like it
[1:36:10] Loud I like it powerful I like my toe to
[1:36:13] tap I like my hands to clap I like
[1:36:15] jumping up and down I like running
[1:36:17] around I'm not against that but I'm here
[1:36:20] to tell you there's a there's a line
[1:36:22] that you can cross where all doing is
[1:36:24] doing something that's popular and
[1:36:26] Grievious to the holy
[1:36:29] spirit
[1:36:30] amen amen praise the Lord I hope y'all
[1:36:33] didn't ruin my
[1:36:35] sermon oh don't get me started let me
[1:36:37] get back to where I
[1:36:39] was so I'm G to try to wind up here with
[1:36:41] this right
[1:36:43] here so there's
[1:36:46] nothing that we Preach Today that's not
[1:36:50] a restoration of what Paul taught right
[1:36:53] if there is tell me what it is tell me
[1:36:54] what Doctrine and fact is you think
[1:36:58] that's something let me one up that when
[1:37:01] John goes to the aisle of
[1:37:04] patmas the prison
[1:37:06] Island Paul's already gone yeah John
[1:37:10] brings back a sealed mystery sealed
[1:37:12] under Seven Seals Paul's not even in the
[1:37:14] earth anymore that's why you don't hear
[1:37:17] Paul quoting from The Book of Revelation
[1:37:20] he never does because he's already gone
[1:37:22] he's already crossed over
[1:37:26] but isn't it
[1:37:27] amazing that
[1:37:29] when when the lamb steps forward and
[1:37:32] takes the book and looses the seals that
[1:37:35] had been sealed up when the church began
[1:37:37] to backslide amen they begin they had
[1:37:40] the original full Abstract title full
[1:37:42] word the son of man Ministry amen son of
[1:37:46] man office and Son of Man Ministry they
[1:37:48] had the full measure of it we're
[1:37:50] restored back to that when they begin to
[1:37:53] line and Fall Away the mystery of
[1:37:55] redemption was sealed up under Seven
[1:37:57] Seals but isn't it amazing that when a
[1:38:00] prophet comes in this day and God brings
[1:38:03] the message to him the unsealed word
[1:38:06] that when it comes in the message of the
[1:38:08] Seven Seals and every consecutive
[1:38:10] message afterward it agreed exactly and
[1:38:12] precisely with everything Paul taught us
[1:38:16] and Paul wasn't even in the earth when
[1:38:17] it was written I'm here to tell you
[1:38:20] friends we have not believed cunningly
[1:38:21] devised Tales we have been restored back
[1:38:24] to the original
[1:38:27] Faith see so so a bride's time is not
[1:38:32] doctrinal teaching and doctrinal
[1:38:34] teaching only the bride's time is not an
[1:38:36] eighth age for needing an eighth
[1:38:38] messenger I again the word I'll Grant
[1:38:41] you you want to say the word has come to
[1:38:43] its Eternal day amen so in that sense
[1:38:45] it's an eighth day there's really not an
[1:38:47] eighth day it just means back to the
[1:38:48] first day so it's went back to the
[1:38:51] original see and so so if people want to
[1:38:54] say I'm an eighth day messenger then I
[1:38:56] want to say then you're back to the
[1:38:58] original then let me see you produce the
[1:39:00] original life and the original Power and
[1:39:02] the original demonstration of the Holy
[1:39:05] Spirit but since they can't then they
[1:39:08] say well it's just doctrinal teaching
[1:39:10] and doctrinal teaching only which we've
[1:39:12] already shown the letter is what kills
[1:39:14] it's the spirit that gives
[1:39:16] life so so and then even though this is
[1:39:19] it back to its original Eternal day my
[1:39:21] soul is back to its original Eternal day
[1:39:24] this body's not the Earth is not even in
[1:39:26] the Millennium the Earth is not the
[1:39:29] Earth is in still in the seventh day
[1:39:30] living out a thousand years of that
[1:39:32] original day it'll go back to its Eighth
[1:39:34] Day when John when Peter said I saw new
[1:39:37] heavens and a new Earth for the first
[1:39:40] were passed away and there was no more
[1:39:42] SE see po Peter talks about it like
[1:39:46] being annihilated John sees it in a
[1:39:47] vision in the Book of
[1:39:49] Revelation so we realize then that what
[1:39:51] it is what is is the bride's time what
[1:39:54] is the bride's age it's a time within
[1:39:57] the last age just like the a time within
[1:40:00] the first age where they had the word
[1:40:03] and the word only meaning the pure word
[1:40:06] alone no man-made
[1:40:09] mongrelization no ad mixture it's the
[1:40:12] pure
[1:40:13] unadulterated that's the only way you
[1:40:15] get the baptism of the Holy Ghost that's
[1:40:18] the only way you get the token I'm not
[1:40:19] saying you can't have an experience just
[1:40:22] like the ages had an exp experience but
[1:40:24] when you come to the word that becomes
[1:40:26] the full token and the requirement of
[1:40:28] your
[1:40:30] age those isus of fathers didn't have
[1:40:33] that they weren't required to have that
[1:40:34] Luther didn't have that he wasn't
[1:40:35] required to have that but you have it
[1:40:38] and you are required to have
[1:40:40] it
[1:40:41] see so so he so then I I showed whoops
[1:40:46] turn myself
[1:40:48] off so then I'm
[1:40:51] taking green means goat thank you so
[1:40:55] then we're talking about as a subtitle
[1:40:59] the Jubilee established and
[1:41:02] restored it was established in the
[1:41:05] original church and it's restored in the
[1:41:09] last Church true church watch to Ephesus
[1:41:14] unto the angel of the Church of Ephesus
[1:41:15] write these things sayith he that
[1:41:17] holdeth the Seven Stars in his right
[1:41:18] hand who walketh in the midst of the
[1:41:21] seven golden candlesticks
[1:41:24] now so Christ is in the midst of the
[1:41:28] church always all right we we believe
[1:41:32] that he walked in the midst of all seven
[1:41:34] lampstands all Seven Ages Christ walked
[1:41:36] in the middle of them you say Well then
[1:41:40] why why did they only have partial truth
[1:41:42] well if you'll notice that what he calls
[1:41:44] himself and this is what brother Brandon
[1:41:45] pointed out that really flipped
[1:41:47] theologians on their on their ear and
[1:41:49] brother brandham says notice that Jesus
[1:41:53] called himself the Alpha and the
[1:41:56] Omega he didn't say much about the
[1:41:59] middle he's walking in the middle but he
[1:42:02] called himself the first and the last
[1:42:05] not a lot about the middle he called
[1:42:07] himself the beginning and the ending but
[1:42:09] not a lot about the middle amen why
[1:42:12] because he would be the word and the
[1:42:14] word only in the first age and the word
[1:42:16] and the word only restored in the last
[1:42:18] age while Christ is walking in the
[1:42:21] middle the middle so so what it is is
[1:42:24] Christ in the middle of the ages yes but
[1:42:27] not everything in the ages is purely him
[1:42:30] you've got an ad mixture of man-made
[1:42:32] theology that's how it goes into the
[1:42:34] Dark Ages this is why the message came
[1:42:37] in this hour I will send to you Elijah
[1:42:39] the prophet to turn your hearts back to
[1:42:41] the faith of the original fathers we're
[1:42:44] not turning back into a partial
[1:42:46] understanding we've come all the way
[1:42:47] back to the original see all
[1:42:51] right I Know Thy Word thy labor and thy
[1:42:54] patience thou cannot bear them which are
[1:42:56] evil is a great church and thou has
[1:42:57] tried them which say they're Apostles
[1:42:59] and are not you know how they did that
[1:43:01] they put them to the Paul test you're
[1:43:03] not saying what Paul said that's right
[1:43:06] and has found them liars and has borne
[1:43:08] and has patience and for my name's sake
[1:43:11] has labored and has not fainted see I
[1:43:14] want you to notice something for my
[1:43:16] name's sake you see
[1:43:19] that after you go from
[1:43:23] irenius into the third age you're going
[1:43:27] to get another mention one last time
[1:43:30] about his
[1:43:31] name and that's why brother Brandon
[1:43:33] would even say which a messenger comes
[1:43:34] at the end of the age that irenius was
[1:43:36] the last one with a clear understanding
[1:43:39] of the godhead so in the LA so in the
[1:43:41] third age then based on irenius that
[1:43:44] that teaching that handed off of baton
[1:43:47] to Martin there there was initially at
[1:43:50] the very early stage still some
[1:43:51] recognition of his name after that you
[1:43:54] don't see it again until you get to the
[1:43:56] sixth age of Philadelphia when he set an
[1:43:59] open door at the end of Philadelphia
[1:44:01] getting ready to go into leoda and you
[1:44:03] get a mention of the name again because
[1:44:05] why a revelation of an open door was
[1:44:08] Christ and they begin to understand
[1:44:10] baptism in jesus'
[1:44:12] name
[1:44:15] see so at this time they still got an
[1:44:18] understanding of his name and and for my
[1:44:20] name's sake has labored has not fainted
[1:44:22] nevertheless here's the problem here it
[1:44:24] comes here's that little lurking all
[1:44:26] he's got to do is pervert the first
[1:44:28] generation yeah and brother bam said it
[1:44:31] just started out as a little saying and
[1:44:33] then the next thing you know then it
[1:44:34] became a deed and then the next thing
[1:44:36] you know it became a full Doctrine and
[1:44:38] and after just a few 50 60 hundred years
[1:44:41] now they have already departed from
[1:44:44] everything in the full word they've
[1:44:45] still got some Revelation Irene is still
[1:44:47] understands the godhead but polycarp is
[1:44:49] already uh being warmed to the idea of
[1:44:52] NC
[1:44:53] leonism that's why brother Brandon went
[1:44:55] and choose him as a messenger and chose
[1:44:57] irenius over him because polycarp baned
[1:44:59] into that kind of language well we've
[1:45:01] got pastors but then we need a
[1:45:03] bishop see so you can see it already
[1:45:05] starting to go
[1:45:08] sideways remember
[1:45:10] therefore from whence Thou Art
[1:45:13] Fallen why do you think why do you think
[1:45:16] the Apostle starts writing letters to
[1:45:18] the church and says we need to earnestly
[1:45:21] contend for the faith once toiv
[1:45:23] delivered amen for men have gone into
[1:45:26] the world creeping into houses and
[1:45:28] leading silly women and captive and all
[1:45:30] these kinds of things are happening the
[1:45:32] gnostics are starting to emerge and
[1:45:33] they're starting to deny and are
[1:45:35] starting to say uh lascivious living is
[1:45:38] okay you don't have to be all Sanctified
[1:45:40] and you get all kinds of of people
[1:45:42] that's where that whole e easy believism
[1:45:46] started it started back there it's only
[1:45:48] come in this age and flowered out but it
[1:45:50] started back there and that's who John
[1:45:53] they didn't you know what they didn't
[1:45:54] believe they didn't believe that Jesus
[1:45:55] was a physical
[1:45:57] human you know why because if they
[1:46:00] believed if they accepted that Jesus was
[1:46:02] a physical human who did always that
[1:46:04] which the father showed him then they
[1:46:06] were obligated to do try to do the same
[1:46:08] thing and they didn't want to do that so
[1:46:10] they started to say oh well he wasn't
[1:46:11] actually a human he was he was an
[1:46:13] apparition he was a ghost he was an
[1:46:15] angel he was a a phantom and that's why
[1:46:19] John writes in his letter anybody who
[1:46:21] will not confess that Jesus Christ Has
[1:46:23] Come In the Flesh as an
[1:46:25] antichrist because those Apostles are
[1:46:27] battling against false Doctrine the
[1:46:29] church is starting to go off track amen
[1:46:33] so so he's saying here this is this is
[1:46:34] the summation of the age remember
[1:46:37] therefore from whence Thou Art fallen
[1:46:39] and repent and do th the first works or
[1:46:42] or else I will come unto thee quickly
[1:46:44] and remove thy Candlestick out of his
[1:46:46] place except thou
[1:46:48] repent uh but this thou Hast that thou
[1:46:52] hatest the Deeds of the nicians which I
[1:46:54] also hate that's conquer the L that's
[1:46:56] hierarchical order put into the church
[1:46:59] he that hath an ear says this at the end
[1:47:01] of every age he that hath an ear let him
[1:47:03] hear what the spirit saith unto the
[1:47:04] churches to him that overcometh will I
[1:47:06] give to eat of the tree of life which is
[1:47:08] in the midst of the garden midst of the
[1:47:09] paradise of God all right now we come to
[1:47:12] the last
[1:47:13] age and unto the angel of the Church of
[1:47:16] the Leo Deans write these things sayith
[1:47:18] the amen the faithful and true witness
[1:47:20] the beginning of the creation of God I
[1:47:23] Know Thy works that thou art neither
[1:47:25] cold nor hot I would thou W cold or hot
[1:47:28] so then because Thou Art lukewarm and
[1:47:30] neither cold nor hot this is the church
[1:47:33] I will spew thee out of my mouth because
[1:47:37] thou sayest I am rich and increased with
[1:47:39] goods and have need of nothing and
[1:47:41] knowest not that thou art wretched this
[1:47:43] is the church miserable this is the
[1:47:46] church poor and blind and naked that's
[1:47:51] the leot toan church age that's his
[1:47:54] that's his overview of the whole
[1:47:56] church watch so that's really
[1:48:01] bad can you believe it could get
[1:48:04] worse it was as wor it was as bad as it
[1:48:07] could get until it wasn't and then it
[1:48:09] got
[1:48:09] worse I counsel thee here's the message
[1:48:13] buy of me gold tried in the fire that
[1:48:15] thou mayest be rich in white rant see
[1:48:17] this only comes by the word of God that
[1:48:19] thou mayest be clothed and that the
[1:48:21] shame of thy nakedness do not appear and
[1:48:24] anoint thine eyes with isaf that thou
[1:48:26] mayest see as many as I love I rebuke
[1:48:28] and chasen be zealous therefore and
[1:48:32] repent say well there's a little bit of
[1:48:34] Hope behold I stand at the door and
[1:48:36] knock if what he's been put out of his
[1:48:40] church he doesn't say that to any other
[1:48:44] church and in fact is friends do you
[1:48:47] realize that to the leoan church he has
[1:48:49] nothing good to point out they're just
[1:48:51] miserable poor blind naked he he warns
[1:48:55] them to buy isav you better repent he
[1:48:57] doesn't even have anything good to say
[1:48:59] do you know that in just the age prior
[1:49:01] in Philadelphia had nothing bad to say
[1:49:03] every age even Ephesus he had something
[1:49:05] bad you know you've done this you've Lo
[1:49:07] lost your first love you fell away but
[1:49:09] you do hate the Deeds of the nickel and
[1:49:10] so we're okay we're going to keep going
[1:49:12] he gets to Philadelphia to Wesley's age
[1:49:14] he doesn't even have a bad word the
[1:49:16] whole age is like beautiful how do you
[1:49:19] go from the sixth age when he doesn't
[1:49:21] have a single bad thing to say to the
[1:49:24] last age when he's got not a single good
[1:49:26] thing to say you understand Fallen
[1:49:28] Angels haven't multiplied but unbelief
[1:49:31] has multiplied because a message came
[1:49:34] and the message and his the messenger
[1:49:37] and his message were rejected and now
[1:49:39] Christ is put out of his church behold I
[1:49:42] stand at the door and knock at don't no
[1:49:45] other age suffered this but us if any
[1:49:50] man I'm not even calling the church I'm
[1:49:52] not going after denominations If any man
[1:49:55] that's mankind that's Humanity male or
[1:49:57] female if any man hear my voice open the
[1:50:00] door I will come into him and will St
[1:50:04] with him and he with me have you heard
[1:50:06] His Voice have you opened your heart to
[1:50:09] his voice you don't have to belong to
[1:50:12] their Church you have to belong to
[1:50:16] Christ and sub with me and he with
[1:50:20] me to him that over
[1:50:23] cometh overcome what the
[1:50:27] deception the deception that the last
[1:50:29] Church age is under to him that
[1:50:32] overcometh I will grant to sit with me
[1:50:34] in my throne even as I also overcame him
[1:50:36] sat down with my father in his throne
[1:50:38] here it is again he that hath an ear see
[1:50:41] Mercy's not over even at the last age
[1:50:43] even when Christ is put out Mercy's not
[1:50:46] over he that hath an ear let him hear
[1:50:48] what the spirit saith to the churches is
[1:50:51] there still Mercy yes yes did he claim
[1:50:53] the book yes so is there still Mercy yes
[1:50:56] whoever will have an ear to hear how do
[1:50:58] you get Redeemed by hearing the word and
[1:51:01] coming to the word and having an
[1:51:02] experience in the word you don't get it
[1:51:05] by joining a church not even this
[1:51:08] church so when we look then at the first
[1:51:12] age I couldn't make it bigger than that
[1:51:14] I apologize I probably could have but I
[1:51:17] just wanted to do this I'll help you
[1:51:18] understand it now this is The Seven Ages
[1:51:22] starting with Eep Ephesus and samna and
[1:51:24] pergamus and thyra and Sardis and
[1:51:26] Philadelphia and leoa I haven't put all
[1:51:29] that in there but you're familiar now
[1:51:30] the the ages are not to scale with
[1:51:32] history and time in fact is the middle
[1:51:33] age is the biggest of all it's the Dark
[1:51:35] Ages over a thousand years so I haven't
[1:51:37] made them to scale I just put them there
[1:51:39] for reference okay the first one and the
[1:51:42] last one are not the biggest ones but
[1:51:43] I'm just doing that so you can see so in
[1:51:46] the so in the first age you had a
[1:51:49] jubilee the token the quickening power
[1:51:52] power What followed that you had an
[1:51:55] anointed Prophet amen Paul got knocked
[1:51:59] out of his horse the church didn't start
[1:52:01] with
[1:52:02] Paul didn't start with an anointed
[1:52:05] Prophet it started with the
[1:52:07] Jubilee you get me it started with
[1:52:10] quickening power that's important then a
[1:52:13] prophet got called now did Paul become a
[1:52:15] prophet when God called him know he was
[1:52:17] always a prophet but he became an
[1:52:19] anointed prophet and then what happened
[1:52:21] then the message came
[1:52:23] and then you've got all the disciples
[1:52:24] including Peter who's supposed to be the
[1:52:26] spokesman for the church who's the one
[1:52:28] who has the keys to to to to Heaven and
[1:52:31] Earth actually says you're going to have
[1:52:33] to believe what Paul said or you're
[1:52:34] going to be
[1:52:36] lost Peter we really like you but don't
[1:52:38] like Paul then you're doomed because
[1:52:41] even I have to AC acquest to Paul yeah
[1:52:44] even my Revelation has to agree with his
[1:52:46] his don't have to agree with mine mine
[1:52:47] has to agree with his see you get me all
[1:52:51] right now
[1:52:52] listen friends I I'll give you a
[1:52:55] demonstration I started to use Ai and do
[1:52:57] a video but I just decided to just give
[1:52:59] you demonstration to keep it simple
[1:53:02] sometimes you just keep it simple
[1:53:06] stupid so so what
[1:53:10] happens you start with a
[1:53:12] jubilee with a token with quickening
[1:53:15] power then you get an anointed Prophet
[1:53:18] then you get a
[1:53:20] message and then all you're doing at the
[1:53:22] end time under
[1:53:24] restoration what's at the end here
[1:53:27] Jubilee token quickening power is that
[1:53:30] at the is that is that at the end is
[1:53:32] that at the beginning then when you
[1:53:34] bring it around to the ending what does
[1:53:37] it end with quickening power what does
[1:53:40] it start with look what does it start
[1:53:42] with a mighty Angel
[1:53:45] descended open the book send it down to
[1:53:48] a prophet then you have an anointed
[1:53:50] Prophet was William brandom only a
[1:53:52] prophet when the seals came no he was
[1:53:54] always a prophet but Malachi 4 was not
[1:53:57] fulfilled until now you've got a a
[1:54:00] prophet who was born a prophet is now an
[1:54:02] anointed Prophet who receives the word
[1:54:04] and gives it to the people and the age
[1:54:06] finishes with the Jubilee restored the
[1:54:09] token restored quickening power restored
[1:54:13] I don't understand people who say we
[1:54:15] don't have the quickening power it
[1:54:17] started with it it's ending with it
[1:54:20] that's why a prophet came that's why a
[1:54:22] message
[1:54:23] came Hallelujah friends we have the
[1:54:26] quickening power therefore God started
[1:54:30] his church like he wanted it now he
[1:54:32] wants it like he started it and all it's
[1:54:35] done you say well why why did why did it
[1:54:39] start with Jubilee because you didn't
[1:54:40] even have a church until the Jubilee was
[1:54:43] there you didn't have it until the token
[1:54:46] was in play and then it called a prophet
[1:54:49] and then he had a message but in our day
[1:54:51] a message comes a prophet is called and
[1:54:54] we leave here under quickening
[1:54:57] power we leave here under the full
[1:55:00] measure of the Jubilee the full measure
[1:55:03] of the
[1:55:05] token oh friends I cannot make it
[1:55:09] plainer to you today don't let anybody
[1:55:11] ever tell you that the word and the word
[1:55:14] only is just doctrinal teaching and
[1:55:16] that's all we need that's not what we
[1:55:18] stop end with we end with quickening
[1:55:22] power power we end with the Saints
[1:55:24] Rising we end up with our bodies being
[1:55:29] changed so don't tell me it's an eighth
[1:55:32] age it's a bride's time within the last
[1:55:36] age both the the whole church ages the
[1:55:40] whole church
[1:55:42] ages remember Alpha and Omega yes
[1:55:46] amen so the the whole age started with
[1:55:50] the power and demonstration of the Holy
[1:55:52] Spirit
[1:55:53] God bookended this age with a prophet
[1:55:56] who had a message and the power and
[1:55:58] demonstration of the Holy Spirit and he
[1:56:00] bookends to the last age with a prophet
[1:56:04] with a message and the power and
[1:56:05] demonstration of the Holy Spirit he's
[1:56:08] the alpha and he's the Omega he's the
[1:56:11] first and he's the last he's the
[1:56:14] beginning of the creation of God you are
[1:56:17] the continuation of that same
[1:56:20] creation Ephesus a continuation that's
[1:56:24] that's why they had the ministry of the
[1:56:25] son of man because they were a
[1:56:28] continuation of the ministry of Jesus
[1:56:31] Amen what what is the office of Son of
[1:56:35] Man
[1:56:36] Prophet what is the ministry of the son
[1:56:38] of man the word made
[1:56:40] flesh you understand Jesus was was the
[1:56:44] prophet he was he was the son of man as
[1:56:47] a prophet but he was the word made flesh
[1:56:50] and when the Holy Spirit came down down
[1:56:52] into the church in the upper room now
[1:56:56] the Life of Christ is Multiplied into
[1:56:58] the people he's the beginning of the
[1:57:01] creation of God because that that term
[1:57:04] brother Brandon points out doesn't make
[1:57:07] logical sense because how God's not
[1:57:09] created so how does it call him the
[1:57:11] beginning of the creation of God that's
[1:57:13] that's jammed up that's that that's
[1:57:16] that's that's that's just combobulated
[1:57:18] he God wasn't created so what happened
[1:57:21] is God condescended into a human and
[1:57:25] then God took that human to the Cross
[1:57:28] amen and then that body went into the
[1:57:30] tomb and then it raised up it ascended
[1:57:32] on high that body laid on a mercy seat
[1:57:35] God took the life that was in the body
[1:57:37] which was his life and sent it back into
[1:57:40] the church and you're the continuation
[1:57:42] of that original
[1:57:45] creation that is what has been restored
[1:57:49] to this day and this hour my friends
[1:57:52] stand on your feet and rejoice with me
[1:57:54] this morning because arise you have
[1:57:57] Arisen the light is shining in our day
[1:58:00] we have come to the end of Darkness
[1:58:03] hallu Darkness permeated Darkness
[1:58:06] multiplied it will continue to
[1:58:12] multiply the only
[1:58:16] thing that can
[1:58:18] save the
[1:58:20] 144,000 is because they receive this
[1:58:25] message Israel as a nation that's why
[1:58:30] the Bible says they're born in a day you
[1:58:33] say wait a minute the six point star of
[1:58:36] David is the oldest flag known to human
[1:58:39] history it that's been flying for
[1:58:41] thousands of years Israel was a nation
[1:58:43] all the way back they had a king they
[1:58:45] had a they had everything but Israel
[1:58:47] becomes a nation in a day because Israel
[1:58:50] rejected their Messiah
[1:58:52] but at the end time there's 144,000
[1:58:55] 12,000 out of each tribe yes amen it's
[1:58:59] amazing that even balum saw
[1:59:01] that when the wise listen when the wise
[1:59:04] men came following a star they were
[1:59:06] following balam's
[1:59:08] prophecy because because the anointing
[1:59:11] of Christ can fall on a false vessel and
[1:59:14] he'll prophesy truth it happened to Bam
[1:59:16] it happened to Caiaphas
[1:59:18] amen balum saw him at the end time and
[1:59:21] he saw all the tribes in their tribal
[1:59:24] order in their tents that's Feast of
[1:59:27] Tabernacles that's the Millennium you
[1:59:30] understand I don't have time to teach on
[1:59:31] that today but balam actually saw what
[1:59:33] the end of that would be and why did
[1:59:35] they get restored back because the word
[1:59:37] that they rejected they Moses and Elijah
[1:59:39] take it to them when the bride are gone
[1:59:41] is gone when the bride lifts off of the
[1:59:43] earth that's it for the
[1:59:45] Gentiles then there's no more Mercy for
[1:59:47] the Gentiles because the bride is the
[1:59:50] blood of God by the spirit the bride
[1:59:52] guide is the continuation of the word
[1:59:54] she's she is the The Living Word she has
[1:59:56] she carries a living message you
[1:59:59] understand so Redemption only comes
[2:00:01] through that word doesn't you don't have
[2:00:03] to come to me for your Redemption but
[2:00:05] I'm preaching a word that will as the
[2:00:07] only thing that can give you Redemption
[2:00:09] amen we're not here to exalt a man we're
[2:00:11] here to exalt the
[2:00:13] man amen and once that bride who's the
[2:00:16] blood of God by the spirit cuz it's a
[2:00:18] bleeding word cuz life is in the word
[2:00:20] blood the blood is in the word that's
[2:00:22] why John said if we walk in the light as
[2:00:24] he's in the light then the blood of
[2:00:26] Jesus Christ cleanses us from sin so you
[2:00:28] have to walk in his word to get the
[2:00:30] cleansing of the blood say well I I I I
[2:00:33] I read the sinner's prayer Jesus Christ
[2:00:34] Son of God died to save Sinners I accept
[2:00:36] that I'm born again well you might be on
[2:00:39] your way to a new birth but you haven't
[2:00:41] got the token yet you've only got the
[2:00:43] token when you have said amen to the
[2:00:45] engrafted word of this hour that's why
[2:00:48] God sent a message that's why God sent
[2:00:50] if you reject that message you'll end up
[2:00:52] in a tribulation period I don't care
[2:00:55] what kind of a Christian you say you are
[2:00:57] and and when the bride goes home then
[2:01:00] the blood is gone for the Gentiles God
[2:01:03] sees all the sin of the world and that's
[2:01:05] what starts the tribulation that's what
[2:01:07] lets the judgments loose now that eagle
[2:01:10] anointing doesn't go home doesn't go
[2:01:11] back to the throne that eagle anointing
[2:01:13] lifts up flies East picks up Moses and
[2:01:16] Elijah and goes to the 144,000 with this
[2:01:18] same gospel message of the token
[2:01:22] they receive it and then they're brought
[2:01:25] up with Moses and Elijah to be in the
[2:01:26] Millennium they're part of the first
[2:01:27] resurrection the foolish virgin aren't
[2:01:30] part of the first resurrection but they
[2:01:32] get enough of the truth they agree with
[2:01:34] just enough of the truth to not take the
[2:01:37] mark of the beast see they die they give
[2:01:41] their life in the tribulation they die
[2:01:42] as Martyrs and at the great white Throne
[2:01:44] they're given a fair trial and a
[2:01:46] judgment God looks in their heart to see
[2:01:48] if they believed everything he revealed
[2:01:50] to them he can't condemn them for what
[2:01:51] he didn't reveal but whatever he
[2:01:53] revealed they better not be guilty of
[2:01:55] condem of of refusing it see doesn't
[2:01:58] matter what kind of Life they lived
[2:01:59] whatever God reveals to you you are
[2:02:01] obligated to believe it or be doomed see
[2:02:05] amen oh friends what an hour what a day

[2:04:48] had preached such wonderful
[2:04:52] truths had brought such a reality to the
[2:04:55] word but looking out over the audience

[2:05:03] done Lord I pray today that you will
