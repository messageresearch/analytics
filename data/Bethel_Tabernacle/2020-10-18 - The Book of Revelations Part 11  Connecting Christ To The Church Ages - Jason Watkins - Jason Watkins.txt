========================================
[Music] [Music] so [Music] so [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] so [Music] so that's it [Music] so [Music] [Music] so [Music] [Music] praise the lord wow it's nice to see some faces for sunday school class god bless you hello good to see you brother god bless happy to have you and sister here today amen we're going to invite you to stand and we'll read right quick um i want to just turn to the book of revelation chapter one we're continuing in our study on the entire book of revelation and we're sufficiently finished with um chapter one however we want to finish the connection between christ introducing himself in chapter one and his movement in the churches beginning in chapter two amen i trust you've been enjoying the sunday school class and uh again i remind you that we're not covering it exhaustively in this class we will be covering it exhaustively in the podcast i've had a lot of emails when is that podcast going to start well we're working on it trust me and all things are pretty much ready at this point um brother jd is out of town today so he's preaching for brother keith brown in florida want to be remembering him and i don't know if he took the family with him i don't see sister amy or the kids so they might all be with him amen revelation chapter 1 and we want to just read uh from verses 2 verse 20 and then we'll catch verse 1 of chapter 2 to make the connection the mystery of the seven stars which thou sowest in my right hand and the seven golden candlesticks the seven stars are the angels of the seven churches and the seven candlesticks which thou sawest are the seven churches verse 1 of chapter 2 unto the angel of the church of ephesus right these things saith he that holdeth the seven stars in his right hand who walketh in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks father we commit our lesson into your care today now lord may you bless the people may you let it flow freely to them as it did to me commit myself into your hands for service in jesus name amen god bless your friends as you're seated one of the statements that we finished up with was on our last time was how that we dealt with god blinding israel and paul dealt with that quite a bit and i don't have sufficient time in the sunday school class to backtrack a whole lot you would have to get the archive but we just briefly we were dealing with the connections that paul made in the scriptures and through the book of acts chapter 13 verse 46 and in romans 11 7 just by reminder paul says what then israel hath not obtained that which he seeketh for but the election hath obtained it and the rest were blinded so we were concluding last time on how the reason that he blinded them was so that god could in fact turn from the jews to the gentiles the scripture says that god will take out of the people a bride from the gentiles he calls israel his wife remember that israel was the wife of jehovah and he calls his wife israel to jehovah but he calls the true church the bride of jesus christ and that's that has to be made made known you have to catch that and so you you can you can realize why there's a uh uh a what we would call election and remnant brother ram said in every age whether that would be new testament or old testament you find a remnant in every age certainly the old testament uh had its time of ages as well brother brennan makes that reference though he doesn't get down into the bolts of nuts and bolts of that too much just makes a few reference points that gives us some some kind of some land markers to try to put the rest of it together and um we find that in acts 15 verse 14 simeon hath declared how god at the first did visit the gentiles to take out of them a people for his name because the wife takes the husband's name and so you see that all the way down through the bible you see joseph which was probably the best type of christ i i guess you could point to moses but i think that joseph would be the most complete picture in in certain ways uh that how that he was in exile that he was given a gentile bride by pharaoh he was given asnath who was a gentile and so we know that it was his gentile bride that was dismissed to the palace when he made himself known to the hundred and to to his brethren particularly to benjamin we do see a type of course in moses you know moses when he was in exile took uh a non-hebrew wife and took zipporah and so this this type is all through the scripture and so each letter then in revelation chapter 2 and revelation chapter 3 he now begins to address himself to each messenger because and in our thorough examination of chapter 1 we were showing you how that the book of revelation being really more perfectly not exclusively but more perfectly the bride's book at the end time because john was translated to the day of the lord and so that you can see how brother branham comes into there and he talks about the ages and then he says you know the the the bride goes up at the end of chapter three she's not seen again until revelation 19 when she comes out as the armies of heaven however he takes chapter five he mentions specifically and of course chapter four and chapter five are you shouldn't divide them as separate events they're exactly the same event and so chapter four begins the process of opening up into chapter five and brother branham says he uses those chapter that chapter five to explain how he pulled it off remember that how he managed to get a bride out of the ages into a rapture and then of course from there on he's going to continue to demonstrate remember that the book of revelation is not like the gospels the gospels was christ operating christ jesus christ who created all things now operating in a human ministry as the redeemer as the as the lamb of god and he had a ministry there but we've showed you many times that god's plan was never to stay bottled up in a single man walking the source of galilee and so then of course you have the book of acts which records the early history of the holy ghost working in the church then when you come to the book of revelation we find that it's introduced to the church after paul is gone john comes back with it he's the last one to die dies of actually dies of natural causes as an elderly brother and statesman of the church and so we realize that it's a book of symbols and so what it is now is it's the revelation of jesus christ that god gave to him to show the churches this is how i'm now going to work i'm going to work in my body in the ages to come and so that's important that you understand that so we realize he begins speaking to the messenger of each age to the to the of each of the seven ages and we find out that the book is prophecy sealed and of course you you it's going to stay that way and revelation 10 4 can you give me 10 4 josh can you find revelation 10 4 real quick just to put that up sorry to jump you i should have had that already you notified but we find that this book is prophecy sealed and you'll notice here uh in revelation 10 4 when the seven thunders had uttered their voices i was about to write and i heard a voice from heaven saying unto me seal up those things which the seven thunders uttered and write them not and so when we look at that we realize that the voice of god and this is how we've been understood and to understand it by the teachings of brother branham that the voice of god then is a thunder and so you know brother branham makes the statement when he's asked about the seven thunders and he says you know the thunders were the mysteries that came out of the seals and so of course the opening of the seven seals opened up the whole book broke all the seals and opened all the mysteries not for theology remember that it's not for to make you bet with better theology than the baptist but it was so that you could be transformed into the open word because that's what it's all about is about christ being manifest to the world through his church through his bride that's what the book of revelation is really about it's to give us con it's to give us context for who we are how we got here what what we're to do and how it's going to conclude and so the book of revelation being open to us that's why we say again that it is particularly with an emphasis for the bride of the last days so that she can uh qualify and quantify everything that is happening around her it's what takes the fear out of us amen it's what gives us purpose it's what gives us understanding it's what it's what opens us up to realize that we're not here by an accident our lives are are driven by the purpose of god so your life is purpose driven you don't own it see so let us be glad and rejoice for the bride hath made herself ready how did she do it by the un unsealing of this mystery and so god then the voice of god being a thunder he speaks seven times and how did he speak he spoke through man uh to an age he spoke seven times but of course it was sealed up and not to be understood uh until the end time it had to be that way because the church fell away there was certainly not sealed up to paul everything that paul taught he understood clearly the mystery of melchizedek he understood clearly the rapture of the church in cycles he understood clearly the godhead the baptism predestination serpent seed election i mean what doctrine do we have in the message that doesn't come from paul's teaching not a single one and so we realized that they were they did have the full abstract they did have the jubilee they they had um the the the mighty god unveiled but after but after the disciples fall away and paul falls away the church begins its backslide of course at that point the church can't go in the rapture christ must sit back down now on the throne he can't step forward and take his bride just come by his side because now she's a fallen woman and that was necessary that wasn't the devil's sucker-punching god that was necessary because that seed had to follow like christ had to go into the ground and come back up again like a phoenix from the flames now the one of the things that is going to make this last day brad unique uh uh unique completely unique from all other ages is that she is predestinated not to fall every age fell israel fell the early church fell this bride won't and can't the womb is already sealed she's already been impregnated with the word of god so so when you received the mystery of christ it already begins a transformation in you once a woman becomes pregnant she can't stop the transformation and man if she does that she does that only does that by breaking god's law and and murdering a child and so but the bride of christ isn't going to miscarry she's going to see this thing through to a body change and so we realize then that he speaks seven times and so christ you know sits down upon the throne seals the book in seven seals it's got to wait for the end time for elijah to come forward and break them back open to the church and so now we have been restored back to that perfect word the final voice to the final age because why what have i taught you because we've been restored to paul's original teaching who was the final voice to all the ages remember that nothing can be added to paul's teaching even paul can't add to it nothing can take away not even god could take away from paul's teaching it can't be countermanded even by god because god gave it to paul and paul was speaking it thus saith the lord it became scripture and therefore heavens and earth will pass away but not one word of god's word can ever pass away so the lord sealed it with an oath and so we find then that he brings his letter you know to each age and you see the pattern uh you see this pattern constantly where every age opens up how that jesus declares you know one of his manifested attributes and he he's always tying it back to this very first chapter it's why we've taken so long i think today's part 11 i think just on chapter one don't know that we'll need that many uh on on each of the ages maybe until we get further along but chapter one is so important that you understand what christ who it is and what he's doing and why he's doing it and what he's to accomplish and so in every age chapter one is so important that he opens every age with some type of a reference to one of his manifold attributes you're gonna see that then of course there's a condemnation uh i'm sorry uh well there is a condemnation to every age except philadelphia and there is a commendation to every age except laodicea you catch that so we find then that there's an exhortation there's a promise of a reward to the overcomer and and so you know jesus is going to address the angel uh of the age and he's going to give a description of himself it's amazing how that when we come down to the last day that we we remember how that we've taught you that everything uh and brother branham taught uh i should say brother branham taught us that that they're cumulative and they accumulate and so you see that in the pattern of the horse riders the white to the red to the black accumulates into the pale and that that also makes our age unique that's why it's satan's eden that's why he's the god of this evil age that those are unique characteristics to this age alone and so we we realized now it's it doesn't mean that it's a a greater mystery or a further truth we're not preaching another jesus in the end time message it's a restoration of the original but there is a a further manifestation because if if you can't see that anywhere in the middle just let me cut to the chase and point it out to you at the end we get a body change amen that's never happened amen right not universally not a bride not a many member bride who's the who's now the fullness of the godhead in a mini-membered bride as jesus was in a single body and so we realized that while we were not neglectful to remind us ourselves of enoch as a type of being translated but this will be the first time that god has ever brought the holy ghost on a people universally and transformed them at the molecular level wow and we're almost home friend what an hour that we live in and so we we realized then that that he's he's he it's further areas of manifestation that the first church would have reached had they not fallen away from so you've got to keep that in your mind real clear it's not a further another jesus or new mysteries or further mysteries there's nothing that the book of revelation i've said this before there's nothing that the that understanding the book of revelation there's nothing in it that reveals a a further understanding of god as far as doctrinally understanding it however paul does make a reference to looking through a glass darkly now that's not doctrine that's where people mistake paul's not speaking of doctrine he's speaking of manifestation paul could see that we're going to be changed he writes about it in a moment in the twinkling of an eye he had went up into heaven and he heard things that couldn't even be uttered so he knew it was there and he's preaching listen friends here's what's going to happen church that the dead in christ shall rise first and we which are alive and remain shall be caught up now he knew that was going to happen but it didn't manifest itself in his age you understand so that so in that in that way they looked through a glass darkly looking to because when you when you when you when something happens to you and you experience it you have a better understanding i mean you can read all the books in the world about what it is to have children but until you have them amen then what happens everything you understood theologically from reading this baby book suddenly you're going oh wow boy where are they shortchanging me here there's way more to it you know and it's not that greater it's not a greater theology but it is a further manifestation we're coming to the time frames and that that that that that that darkly of that manifestation is getting brighter and brighter and brighter because we've already came to the sun rising the sun is already up we're already under full light and you know what that's doing that's transforming you into full light what's it going to do it's going to change you at the atoms it's going to change you at the molecular level we are literally uh eating our way to a body change because you assimilate you are what you eat you are what you feed on amen so so we realized then that this pattern as i've said if we look at revelation 2 1 i've got nine minutes to close up here and that's using up my five minutes of overtime um we find that revelation 2 1. watch unto the angel of the church of ephesus right these things saith he ah that holdeth the seven stars in his right hand now this is the same attribute described in revelation 1 13. so you see when he comes even comes into chapter two he connects back they go it's still me right now it's still me in you see revelation 2 1 all right now watch this commendation i know thy works and thy labor and thy patience and how thou canst not bear them which are evil has tried them which say they are apostles and are not and has found them to be liars and so so here you see that the bride is demonstrating catch it now he's he's commending the age that that you have caught liars in your midst and you've identified them and you were right well done and god and so we realized then that the bride is demonstrating that he the same one in chapter one is actively operating through yes amen because he didn't come down and say and send a prophet in and say hey that one's wrong that one's a liar that one says he's a jew he's really not god didn't need to do that the bride had a discernment of spirit within her and so she's proving by her life that she is an active manifestation in chapter two of what he said he would be in chapter one amen oh and that's where we're at my friend so now watch uh verse um three and has borne two uh chapter two verse three and has borne and has patience and for my name's sake uh has labored and has not fainted so he's commending them two four to six watch this here's the complaint notice the complaint all right uh he had a common accommodation now he's got a complaint nevertheless i have somewhat against thee because thou has left my first love remember therefore from whence thou art fallen and repent and do the first works or else i will come to thee quickly and will remove thy candlestick out of his place except thou repent but this thou hast thou thou hatest the deeds of the nicolaitans which i also hate all right 2 7. all right now watch then there's then there's this promise of the reward to the overcomer he that hath in here let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches to him that overcometh will i give to eat of the tree of life which is in the midst of the paradise of god now the sumerian age he does the same thing you know 2 8 unto the angel of the church of smyrna right these things say at the first and the last and was which was dead in his life there he is back in chapter 1 verse 17 again you see how he's constantly connecting to say it's not ever going to be you it's going to be me in you that's the secret yes that's what separates you from denominationalism and organized religion that that is a man-made system this is a god-made thing amen i'm not supposed to be preaching on sunday school for a while but i get excited oh i got four minutes all right so so we you find it costly 2 9 jesus introduces himself and and he's commending you know uh on their their condition look i i know your works and tribulation and poverty thou art rich and i know the blasphemy them which say they're jews and are not the synagogue of satan and so and then he goes into 10 to 11 starts starts you know giving them a commendation see fear none of those things which thou shalt suffer the devil cast some of you into prison he may be tried slept tribulation 10 days we'll deal with that when we get into the church age itself be thou faithful unto death i'll give you the crown of life he that hath and here let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches so there it is again this promise to the overcomer and we've shown how that that it is that it is cumulative just like just like white horse red horse black horse yeah lion ox man eagle and so it accumulates in each age even the wrath pours over from age to age because the cup of iniquity is not full and so every age he opens a seal partially drops a mystery down a messenger catches it there it goes forth gathers a people there's a rejection and then a temporary judgment is dropped and the cup of iniquity not the full cup not the tribulation period but it pours over into the next stage and just keeps accumulating keeps accumulating till we come to the last where we're literally in satan's eden amen say my we're in trouble no we're not because we have the mighty god unveiled back among us and he's in you hallelujah don't doubt that he's in you he's well able to handle this age i'm here to tell you friends if you'll keep the flus cleaned out and keep your heart pure god in you is able to handle anything you can face amen amen amen believe that so he's certainly able to do that my we want to we want to have the sword with the two edges and so a lot more to say on that coming forward amen but you better have that sword with two edges i'll just say that friends because that's the only thing that'll stop a devil don't be out here wielding a butter knife that might be fine for spreading peanut butter but that ain't gonna stop a devil that ain't going to stop him from taking your home and your family and your marriage and your finances and your health you're going to need the sword with two edges hallelujah and you're going to find that that's christ operating through you just as well all right i got to close so we we we we can see then that this cumulative this cumulative uh overcoming and that's a beautiful thing let me catch that just before we close i think i may have hit it before remember friends that that everything that they had to overcome in each age and they got a reward our our reward of the last day is that we'll be granted to eat of the tree of life have a crown amen and be seated with christ to him that overcometh will i grant to sit with me in my throne see and you and you have access to the to the tree of life and so so we realized then that that you say well what is what is it that we have to overcome brother jason you've got one thing left only one you know why because cumulatively accumulatively you have already overcome everything the ages have overcome i've already come to overcome the white horse rider he can't fool me i came out of her my people amen we've already overcome the red horse rider we've already come the black horse we've already overcome denominational systems the last thing that we've got to overcome in this age is to overcome the deception that would so strong it would deceive the very elected if possible i'm here to tell you if you're a believer today you've already overcome amen amen you already have understood and overcome and the only thing we're doing here is daily allowing christ to live more and more in our lives god bless you you're dismissed hallelujah
