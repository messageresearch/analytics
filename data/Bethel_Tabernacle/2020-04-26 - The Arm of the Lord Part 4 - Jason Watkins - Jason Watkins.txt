can you say Amen we have missions report this morning amen sigh ran over a little bit but we got a little bit of a late start and brother John has a special maybe we'll bring the minister out on that son today a man come on brother Jason how are we looking on that Power Point brothers all right wonderful so gonna start a trip report or not a trip report but a missions report and want to just give you a little update about what's going on in Egypt and also in Turkey of course everything has changed with what was going on in the world today and so of course missions work has changed as well so we've been we've been meeting with the brothers and keeping in contact with them and they've been they've had to cancel services and they're using Facebook and and so forth to continue their services using zoom to have Bible studies and meet meet with believers in the church and so there there's a consistent process that we have going in that the brothers in in Turkey and Egypt have going to do that do this as well and I've been a part of some of those Bible studies as well and so we're just continuing on by God's grace and just a little Egypt update they but they've been shut down since March 19th haven't been able to have a service since then and just like us they kind of don't really know when they can start up again brother megali he's been having Facebook services with for the church and he pray for him he's right now suffering with some chronic pain in his neck and lower back here's a picture of him and a few of the brothers in the in the church there in Cairo and we just recently printed book two of Supernatural so that's been printed and once once all this ends it'll be distributed so that would be God willing very soon kind of the same idea with missions traveling for missions I would like to make a plan because that's in my nature to plan ahead but there's no way to make a plan so we're just waiting on when things are open of course there's flights you can take a flight to Turkey or Egypt but you would get there and pretty much sit in a hotel or in someone's home and not be able to do much of anything so flights some flights are open but it's not a matter of that it's a matter of the public being open up up up again and so we're just kind of waiting on that book six of supernatural has been translated so the work there of translating is done we're going through edits on book three four five and six will kind of go through those step-by-step as we prepare them for printing and I recently found a service that you can use that will translate YouTube videos into many many different languages and so I've started doing that so the they make they make a transcript of the English then they they'll translate it to Arabic and then my Arabic translator can go in and review the Arabic translation and change it as needed so the videos that I'm doing I'm doing are gonna be made made into Arabic and brother Omid is translating those videos also into Farsi but that was with that it would be a voiceover for them so turkey update for the last several years brother Nehemiah's home Church in the Toronto area has been sponsoring the printing and shipping of the message and they're continuing to do that so they're printing it in in Toronto and they're actually ship mailing it over to Turkey to the different Edge's and believers there they've also recently purchased had printed a thousand Bibles for us to have there and distribute so we're really really excited for that because the persian old version which would be similar to our King James Version is actually going out of print there so we've had to go and contact the printer and say can we print them and they've given us the okay to do that so we're now able to print as we have needed but of course you have to print in bulk and that church there in Milton Ontario has been a great blessing to be able to do that print those and provide for the shipping as well so now this is from a picture from a recent trip brother Shahin who's the pastor in Denizli has traveled to eskisehir we used to have a church in escucha here now we have a small group of believers there that that are meeting together and watching the services from Deniz Lee and brother shine recently started traveling to visit them and with with shutdown's that's kind of put a wrench in that but we'll get it started again once things open up and this is brother Petros on a recent trip that he took to Turkey in February and meeting with the different ones and and and meeting some in some new areas to see about getting new churches going brother Petros is doing a fantastic job we're gonna be working on a plan to start distributing those Bibles in those books in Turkey we want to do some form of outreach once once this starts opening up whether that be in Istanbul or where we would do that we're not sure but we're just starting the process of making a plan to get that outreach going and we also need to go back and start reprinting the supernatural series in Farsi we have recently printed book six but we got to go back has they've already distributed all of the book one two three four and five so we'll be printing that again soon with God's help um please pray for brother brother Petros in Germany he's he's living in Germany travels back and forth to Turkey quite frequently and he's recently faced some really significant difficulties and he needs needs our prayer and for to face the things he's currently facing he and I'll be traveling back to Turkey once things open up as as soon as the opportunity to go we will be going back so prayers your prayers are appreciated they're essential we can't we can't do it without that so please be diligent in remembering the work in Turkey and Egypt and we need that prayer covering for that so god bless you when we're up other levels he's an older brother and his name is Jean Petrie I'd like to remember him also he is in the

praise God preached in the name of the Lord this morning amen happy to be here again mr. Meredith good to have you here today god bless you g-man good to have you here buddy so happy to have all of you here streaming we're trusting that signals coming through loud and clear appreciate all the work of the teams and their efforts a man even if we fail I promise you we get an A for effort because I'm a person a witness of the rigorous hours that all of our brothers are putting in to try to make it they're trying to make it perfect there's no other way to describe it we know we can't get it perfect but that's our goal so you pray for us as we continue to endeavor amen we're and we're not just throwing money at it I don't do that these brothers have legitimate answers to questions that I ask and whenever we can come up with a solution we're investing in it so it's part of the ministry it's part of the word amen and so we're happy to be able to do that first Peter chapter four today want to give you just a quick update on brother Charles so I spoke to the nurse's station this morning and he had his fever was down to 99 which was nearly normal I spiked a little bit again this morning button but but it leveled off and it's they the nurses words to me was he's daily making small improvements they're not they were having to manually turn him because of the pneumonia she said he's actually turning himself now so his he's getting more clear his comprehension of things I think he even spoke to apparently somebody here from the church gave him a call so god bless you for that I've tried to do that unsuccessfully trying to get a meeting to I'm trying to get it arranged where I can go in under my chaplaincy badge and to his bedside that's not been worked out yet so we're still working on that they are testing him again kovat to make sure to kind of confirm the first test that they did which was negative so we're just continuing to pray for our brother he is still very sick and he's not a young man so things that are pulmonary like that I mean they can you can go off a cliff he really fast and bought him out really quickly and so we're just wanting to continue to pray for him amen we had some other prayer requests that came in brother Kenny you got to those and so we're happy to have all of you on line with us today amen so brother Matt is sending out a an announcement to all booth personnel we're going to have a short meeting with you at 2:00 p.m. via zoom via virtual there are some members of the team that will be there in person I appreciate that and so that's going to start right at 2 o'clock so if you can attend physically that's wonderful if not make sure you get ready virtually I assume it's zoom I don't remember if Matt told me that or not it is very good so brother Matt will be sending out the invitation for that amen we're just needing to try to catch everybody up on where we are based on what we've learned based on trial and error based on experimentation and so we want to we want to outline where we are where we feel that we are and where we want to be and plotting a solution to get from here to there so and then there's some other things on my heart as well so we're just looking for that amen first Peter chapter 4 I will inform you also that we're continuing to monitor the civil authorities for when we can assemble again as a whole Church it's not now but we can see it coming there's light seemingly at the end of the tunnel so we'll keep you updated on that as we gather what they're going to allow remember that we are cooperating fully to preserve our testimony in the community we want to make sure that we because they're not trying to stop us you know from from gathering at all they're not trying to get us to not preach the gospel they're not trying to get us to compromise our beliefs this is not that if this were that we would be saying absolutely no way that's never going to happen but this is not that so that's not a battle that we need to worry about or fight because that's not what this is this is just steps of prudence and wisdom and that's why we are more than willing more than willing to not only comply but to but to help a man a man I want to be I like being part of the answer I like being part of the solution not part of the problem that's that's anathema to me if I think I'm part of the problem wow man I'll take my own self to the woodshed I cannot tolerate wrong within me I can't it's just maybe it's maybe it's I don't know if it's if it's if it's OCD or PTSD or whatever it is but I cannot abide if I know I'm wrong in something I have to fix it stop drop and roll a man if you're on fire stop drop and roll now if your own spiritual fire run amen so I want to be part of the solution and so amen all right first Peter chapter four we've been reading this I wanted to read it today I'm continuing on in the arm of the Lord part four I believe in hope and trust by the grace of God this should be the final installment amen if we can get there amen for as much then verse one first Peter chapter four verse one for as much then as Christ hath suffered for us in the flesh arm yourselves likewise with the same mind for he that hath suffered in the flesh hath ceased from sin that he no longer should live the rest of his time in the flesh to the lusts of men but to the will of God for the time past of our life may suffice us to have wrought the will of the Gentiles when we walked in lasciviousness lusts excesses of wine revellings banqueting x' and abominable idolatries Paul doesn't pull any punches there does he does he a man wherein they think it's strange that you run not with them to the same excessive riot speaking evil of you who shall give account to him that is ready to judge the quick and the dead for for this cause was the gospel preached also to them that are dead that they might be judged according to men in the flesh but live according to the God to God in the spirit but the end of all things is at hand be therefore sober and watch unto prayer amen father we thank you for your word today now I'm ending on you Lord we're depending on you we sing it I pray it I believe it I claim it Lord I'm asking in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ that you remember continue to remember all of our sick and afflicted Lord those who have been shut in father those who Lord are trusting in you Lord we're looking for the arm of the Lord to reach out to us today I commit the service and the sermon myself as a vessel into your hands in Jesus name Amen god bless you as you are seated now I want to bring a specific notice in our reading from verses four through six and I'm going to read them for you from the New Living Translation if you have that mat you can put that up if we don't no worries I'm just going to read these three verses from the NLT Paul says of course your former friends are surprised when you no longer plunge into the flood of wild and destructive things they do so they slander you but remember that they will have to face God who stands ready to judge everyone both the living and the dead that is why the good news was preached to those who are now dead so although they were destined to die like all people they now live forever with God in the spirit that's going to become important as we go along you know I see today such an ironic contrast in preaching about being the hand at the end of the arm of the Lord as we have been ministering on you know it's it's it's ironic to me because that you know we've been shut in we've been you know self quarantined you know staying trying to stay out of the public and only moving out for items of necessity when it necessitated when the need necessitated that we go out so so because that we have been bottled up and closed in and been at home and and you know we're I find it ironic to be preaching on and to say you know we're the hand at the end of the arm over the Lord because that that to me that that says that we should be active and we should be on the move and we should be making tracks and making hay while the Sun is up as my dad always used to say and you know it to me it feel you know we're in the Lord's army how many army members we got here today but you know it seems and it feels to me like I've just been sitting around the barracks and I don't know how I'm best better to describe it you know I go out twice a week and I I blow a bugle you know I and raise a flag and you know on Wednesdays and Sundays you know but but but you know it's got to be done so so I just say let's be found faithful and do what we can the point of the matter is yeah i'm really mainly just sitting around the barracks i'm i come here twice a week to blow a bugle and raise a flag and then but but if that's what I can do then then let me do it with zeal and and let me do it with purpose I like a life to be driven by purpose I don't like idleness and so it's it wars against my mind and so you know brother branham tells a story I heard him telling it this morning and about the lady you remember the Irish lady coming in on a ship to New York Harbor half an hour out she comes in till they come into a raging storm they are the captain is sending out SOS you know it's terrible there the hull could breach and and the captain you know brother Branham says before when the ban you know I've been playing there their boogie-woogie and all of this and everybody partying reveling and dancing suddenly now they want to change the music to near my God to thee and the captain is going around and saying everybody needs to pray just pray in your own way and they come up upon this little sister and she's walking the deck just praising God hallelujah glory to God and and the captain says my good lady did did not we say that everybody should pray and she said I'm prayed up a man I don't need to pray my whole life is prayer my man my whole walking talking moving I don't do anything without praying I'm mind lips and my heart is constantly talking to the Lord he says but listen how did you know you hear what I said that in 30 minutes time we're either gonna be in New York Harbor I'll anchor down with the gang gangplank disembarking in 30 minutes or we're gonna be at the bottom of the ocean and she said well sir she said I got one daughter in glory and I'm coming to New York to visit one daughter in New York so in 30 minutes time I'll be with one of them it doesn't matter to me I thought about you know I thought about I thought about that within my own self you know I could we any of us could be driving on I can be driving along headed to my one of my children's house maybe gonna visit my grandchildren you know what on my way there I mean they're gonna see my children and my grandchildren or drive and see my mom or and if that doesn't work then I'm gonna be visiting my dad and two brothers so it doesn't matter to me my life is in his hands and I want it to be like that I want to live you know like he's coming in the morning how should we live here like he's coming in the morning we plan our lives as if it won't be for another century see so brother BAM said if you've got potatoes to plant get them planted if you want to make investments make them and whatever you know you're going to get an education get it you're gonna get a different job get it you're gonna get married get married plan like he's not coming for another century but live your life like he's coming in the morning amen it means something friends I I hope that you have garnered the real burden of my heart and preaching this scripture from who hath believed our report you know because the arm of the Lord has been extended into the world and I have proven to you through three previous installments that the arm of the Lord is Christ and you are the hand on the end of that arm that he was the vine the father was the farmer the gardener and you are the branches that bring forth the fruit that's why brother Brandon would say he got no hands but yours no lips but yours no feet but yours see that body of the Lord Jesus Christ lays on the altar as a memorial and is not picked up corporately until he is ready to return and so now does does that mean he doesn't have an active body no he has an active body you're it I remember years ago brother Bisco told a story heard it probably 30 years ago and he he was telling about how he was in a meeting you know up and up in an Indian village and he was competing with the Catholic priest for the attention of the people and you know the Catholic priest got up and gave the virtues of the church and trying to serve the communion to those to those Native Americans our native Canadians and and and you know he's he's holding up you know this this bread that somebody you know the whole argument is ensuing that this is not the body of the Lord and the Catholic priest is saying but we have you know we have the authority to turn this into the body of the Lord and so he he holds it up brother hit brother mystical sitting behind him and the Catholic priest holds it up and he says behold the body of Christ and brother head said he couldn't take it he rose to his feet raised up his hands and he says that is not the body of Christ I am the body of Christ you are the body of Christ listen friends that's what we're here for that's the purpose of our life so we need to stay brother branham emphasizes over and over in telling that story we need to stay prayed up we need to stay in the veil your whole life should be in the veil you know it I am convinced that I'm going to find three categories of people when we come back to church and and maybe you say you shouldn't be convinced you should have faith well okay I'll I'll go ahead and have faith in a testimony that everybody's going to come back here more spiritual having missed all of these church services but my fear if I judge it based on Man and history and everything that we see I'm probably going to find people who are pretty much the same and I'm going to find people who are worse off than when we took a break but let me say to you today that's not I'm not coming here we're not holding these services to have you stay the same or certainly not to have you worse I want to see us rising I want to see us advancing I want to for me I want to for you it's a sad world that we live in let me build my case today give you a little dose of reality not that you're not aware of it but you know Peter said I stir you up by way of remembrance so that we we don't you know we're not the image of the you know the somebody with their head stuck in the sand we have to stay prayed up if we're the handout on the end of the arm and the arm is the mediator between God and man and I'm the and gods at one end and Christ is in the middle and I'm at the other end amen hell I love that image and so because it's it's not it's not as much indicating three persons as it's indicating stages I can a God expressing himself do you understand Christ was the beginning of the creation of God and you are the continuation of that same creation that's one of the beautiful things that the message brings out in the Godhead that's what the Trinitarians miss that's what the oneness miss that's what two lords and two souls miss they miss that it's an expression a continuation of one God expressing himself in his family that's the beautiful part of it that's why there would be an invisible union of the heavenly bridegroom in the earthly bride because it's it's husband and wife it always has been husband and wife it's mates it's eternal mates that's what the Godhead is about eternal mates hallelujah and so we want to be the hand at the end of the arm that reaches out to the world and we need to be that we need to be that because because we need to be that because it's a very sad world that we live in let me build my case such as such a sad state and condition that mankind finds himself in this dress rehearsal pandemic that we speak about and literally and we've said this before just my way of remembrance it's literally brought the mightiest nation to the brink it's brought the whole world to the brink of economic collapse they've had to they've had to enact emergency measures just to stay afloat and they don't yet know what more they will have to do the the World Health Organization is announcing get it the worst is yet to come now and they're saying we haven't seen the worst globally yet that's one of their fresh announcements it seems that only a few months ago you're aware of it I don't have to convince you of this it the the the liberal left out like this fact but it's true it seems that only a few months ago the soaring economy had wall street literally drunk with wealth and success but we find that and we all are aware of it God consciousness was in sharp decline and that's Israel was the same way it doesn't mean that Americans are all dirty rats it's mankind with his sinful nature Israel God said when you're in trouble you call him me as soon as I bless you you get fat and you forget me see so we found that they were literally soaring with and drunk with wealth and drunk with success but yet God consciousness was in sharp decline true spirituality and the fear of the Lord all across the nation and across the world in such sharp decline I think that it's not unfair of me to call it a pleasure mad Society racing for for greater and and ever greater achievements you know I mean I am I am I am I right ray you know recreational activities of bounding just months ago you know the Wall Street soaring and recreational activities of bounding professional sporting arenas attended by faithful worshipers around the world oh my you know life was like a life was like a Mardi Gras of decadence twisted perversion and the more perverted the lifestyle the more they loved it the more it was celebrated come on friends you know that's true you can't even if you can't even see a commercial today on the internet or on a device of any kind you can't even see something that's been in families as it like this is a family product this is a staple of homes and you and now they even bring in their perverted lifestyles where it's not a husband and a wife it's two men I mean it's it's so twisted it's so upside down it's so perverted I'm not here trying to rain on our parade I'm just saying this is work where the world has been the more perverted the lifestyle the more they loved it partying as if the cost of life was free you don't hear about too much partying now I said to somebody I said well praise the Lord I said at least we've got all of our blue laws back in effect all the bars are closed not just on Sundays they're closed all the time amen so a man there's a little bit of good come out of it so but you know you don't hear too much about partying anymore every night every night what do you hear you hear on the news about the latest couple thousand who died during the night the latest couple thousand every every night I catch the archive of of national news and it's it's jumping by multiple thousands who were just alive the day prior who aren't in the world anymore only a few months ago self gratification and indulgence literally had the world in a dizzying stupor of false security a false security ending each day with Thanksgiving - they're false idols for the peace and safety that they thought they had little did they know that sudden destruction was coming only a few months ago see an invisible enemy so small it can't even be seen or felt until it has you it would tear down everything that had been built up to dizzying heights the economy entertainment recreation decadence perversion everything that had been built up to dizzying heights it would literally tear it down the global economy jobs Devas physically devastating whole families ripping them apart taking multiple siblings and a parent or both parents and multiple or the whole family I've seen we've seen whole families eliminated scene I seen I seen a report where an elderly mother caught it when in the hospital and she never knew she was unconscious and the intubation never knew her daughter and two sons were in the right down the hall come in two days behind her and she died and then today's behind her they died these aren't made-up stories for you no I'm not not trying to you know make my sermon sensational this is real life this is what's happening it was all I think that you will give me a hearty amen it was all a false position a false security only months ago they felt secure only months ago everyone's for okay 401k looked nice only months ago they were talking about the next stars in the draft day and when it all comes out and suddenly they can't even play games they can't even assemble Wall Street is crashing the government's bailing out everybody people are having to distance themselves and stay at home and and they the the ripple effect this is going to have going forward an expert after expert after expert is saying we'll never go back to that normal again those days are gone I'm here to tell you that's going to be a repeating theme you're going to see as the world moves toward tribulation every day they're going to realize wow what it used to be is fading fading fading and are we ever going to get back to it the answer is no I'm thankful to God that my yesterdays will soon in and the next day I face won't be another day here but it'll be a day there and that day will never end hallelujah not trying to discourage you this morning I'm trying to challenge you I'm trying to excite you to say we're here for a purpose God has all of this under control nothing is out out of in disarray from the word they had a false security they were in a false position a scene a a report that's sad and humorous at the same time that they were interviewing a man with a liquor store and he was saying this was his statement this was a statement every day is New Year's Eve in sales every day is New Year's Eve he said ever since the lockdown every day for me has been New Year's Eve New Year's Eve is when he can't even he's got to hire extra help to handle all the customers who are in there buying up all of their liquor the the marijuana stores it's they're having a they're having a festival they're making so much money there this one guys the average customer that used to be a three or four time he said a few visits a month became a three or four visit a week you know what I thought about and I thought about Chris you know I thought about really Kenny I thought geez I haven't had that urge I haven't had that hurts I've had this urge I've had a completely different set of urging oh my goodness friends why the world is doing that just to cope oh my I want to encourage you today drink it up drink it up come on get a hold of the word eat your fill of the Word of God let the blessings let the rain come down in your homes let the reign of God come down in your lives of your marriage and your children don't miss this grand opportunity that God has given us I haven't had those same kinds of urges thank God Almighty my position is real now that's a contrast they have just months ago they were living in a false position a fake position wasn't real my position could and and their false position led them to become a three or four week liquor store from a couple of few times a month to a three or four a week just to cope it shows their position was sinking sand it and because I have different urges it shows my position is solid rock hallelujah oh my my position is real friends I'm not given the spirit of fear I'm given the spirit of a sound mind I use it in prudent action and trust god there's a real life and there's a fake life you know brother Brandon talks about those those young women he caught in the hallway there you know sing Whoopi this is life drinking scandalously dressed married women one of them a Sunday school teacher and brother branham grabbed him forced him down to try to pray try to pray for him and and and the and he stood back in the shadows not wanting not wanting to get involved until they said the wrong thing and then a prophet couldn't keep still and he was sitting there thinking how shameful how horrible this is and then one of them happened to say it's almost like Goliath was fine until until what he said got hurt by the wrong man and brother branham is standing there as a prophet Elijah and one of them gives out up will be this is this his life and brother Ram said that's it I couldn't take it he said I stepped out of the shadow I said just a minute sister that's a lie said this isn't life this is death it's fake life it's fake life see it's what the devil has tried to get you to say that this is life they had believed you know what they had believed I thought about the term fake news we hear it a lot now Trump didn't invent that fake news has been a reality those girls were believing the fake news of Hollywood in the 1950s brother Brown who used their own slogans life starts after the Sun Goes Down he said I saw that on a magazine sitting on an airplane life starts when the Sun Goes Down he said life don't start with the Sun Goes Down sinning starts when the Sun Goes Down that's a time when devils go on the loose Paul said you're not of the children of the darkness you're children of the light you're not like them you're not going to be destroyed with them you have a different ending than them you have a different purpose than them you have a different reason for living than them see so it was all was all fake news it was all fake life Hollywood is a fake life of course it is you know crime-fighting superheroes romance heroes main character heroes in some epic adventure you know life being lived in the imagination of people's fantasies seeing that wanting to be that person modelling themselves you said all the time people adopt haircuts they adopt clothing styles they adopt you know they start looking like the image of what they're enamoured by oh you can't hide now see this is this you know that's true we've seen it we've seen it in ourselves amen life is being lived in this day and time it's being lived in the imagination of people's fantasies listen friends all professional sports we tell my Hollywood is all fake life professional sports you know for almost all humans it's fake life even fantasy leagues that they create you know to satisfy a craving for that to be their life some people are like fantasy what I mean there's professional sports casters won't have anything to do with it like no we don't do fantasy stuff we do real life they see the the idiocy of it people and I'm not here I'm not here to condemn it I'm just saying okay fine I've never done it I've never understood if you're in it fine whatever not preaching against that you understand not preaching I've cheered my favorite team plenty ass I'm not here preaching about that getting it clear you know that that's not my point but do you realize that that you take the NFL do you realize that all those all the boys that start playing football at pal's level that aren't that less than 1% of every boy that ever puts on a helmet and carries a football less than 1% including the ones who go through high school when championships go to college less than 1% make it to the pro leagues less than 1% see so it supports my statement all professional sports at every level for almost all humans is fake life you're never going to be that but yet the devil will get you so enamored that you will burn up your useful valuable time to serve God and you're chasing something that's fake it'll never be realized you're trying to be a Hollywood star you come on teenagers listen up now don't try to be that don't don't chase after that kind of stuff that live a real life make your life count for something live for eternal purposes you're the hand on the end of the arm that is attached to Almighty God say well but isn't it true that 1% I could be I could be that one ok what if you did what do they have the 1% what do they have if they make it what do they want what does the 1% have if they make it the Bible says I saw the dead both small and great stand before God the books were opened and another book was opened which is the book of life I'm here to tell you that book of life is all that matters even if you happen to be the 1% what are you God at the end of it all oh my my friends that's why brother Brandon would say you're not even living until you're born again every day you wake up in an unconverted state you're just one day closer to your death sentence that you were born with no one can commute that sentence except the giver of life himself only the great judge can do away with all of your former life and make you stand perfect in the sight of God and gain eternal life and be freed from the bondage of sin that you're born into hallelujah you're not even you're not even living all the people chasing Hollywood and all of Hollywood being chased and all the professional sports being chased and even the 1% anybody I'm including any and every and all globally who have not been born again they're there they're only being turned into the very image of the tribulation they're headed for I said that knew weeks ago it's still true today that's what you see happening to the world anybody I don't care how big their yacht is they're being transformed into the image of the tribulation they're headed I don't care how big their contract is I don't care how how much how many how many how much of a presence they have in the world be whatever they want a king a dictator they're being transformed into the very image of the tribulation they're headed into the tribulation they're headed into a such a perversion of life it's going to so unfairly penalize mankind he will be the victim of his own demise it is not as said it is not a you know an evil god that's going to do that God is simply allowing man to destroy himself God has spent 6,000 years trying every way to save every person he possibly could who would accept his pardon yes friends brother branham talks about that dimension of Hell he calls it a nightmare that you can't wake up from that's pretty real that gives real thoughtful description hell is not a metaphor hell is not a parable as the Seventh day Adventist think I think it's seventh-day Adventist thing it's just a metaphor I know that Jehovah's Witness don't believe you know they they certainly sell believe it is I think it's unfair to say its seventh day I think it was Jehovah's Witness I'm confusing and they even when they go to Jesus telling the story of the rich young ruler in hell he lifted up his eyes they say that's just a parable it's hyperbole he's dead there's not a literal place like that which I don't believe that because Jesus says there was a man see so so so but but but the point is he said don't ever let anyone tell you there's not a real devil don't let anyone tell you that hell's not a real place because if they can convince you of that then they can convince you that God's not real in Heaven's not a real place and I think I would be of all men most miserable having tasted of this seven-course meal may it be like inviting me to a big banquet and walking me in and letting me look at it in my and slobbering with oh my goodness the it's so glorious and they tapped me say sorry you don't actually get to eat it you have to leave now we just wanted you to see it I decided herethen ever seen it I'd rather never seen it don't tell me about it now Paul said I'd be above all men most miserable because Paul had already been caught up to a third heaven Paul had already seen and heard things said if I don't get to go there I'd rather never heard it Oh friends I am I in one since I'm so glad that I heard about it but it makes me shiver to think what if I what if I didn't have it oh but then I fall back and I say wait a minute there was a family in the mind of God before the foundation of the world and I am the happy finder that I was part of that family hallelujah it's a nightmare brother branham said you can't wake up from people who find themselves suddenly in that dimension people who have and people who do in this very real dimension place and another dimension just as real as this one they're going to find they're going to realize that they were living a fake life all along in the earth one day saying farewell words to their family being put under a medically-induced condition so that you can be intubated the next time they wake up they're in a nightmare they can't wake up from say you're judging I'm not judging I'm as if I just play the law of averages alone if I just play the law of human averages I'm gonna be right most of the time I my trust and my hope is that nobody in the right mind would come to that position and not make their heart right the problem is so many don't have the right mind because they've allowed Satan to corrupt and poison their mind with fake life fake news about what life is fake news from Hollywood fake news from the from the entertainment industry fake news from the recreation and sports teams fake news from the politician and the worst of all fake news from the pulpits that are supposed to tell us the truth and because pulpits that do tell them the truth are held in derision and condemned as fanatic it's always been that way it will always be that way why are you preaching on today because I gotta try to convince anyone I can I already know I can't convince them all but I hope I convincing you today I hope I'm convincing you today I hope we're all being convinced so I don't want fake life I want real life hallelujah people who find themselves sudden that dimension are going to realize they were living fake life he already had them asleep and walking around in a dream of life slowly they didn't realize that day by day every day that they spurned God every day that they didn't do what was necessary to save themselves as Peter said save yourselves from this untoward generation and every day they didn't do that they walked around in their dream life slowly descending into a state of complete madness we see it on the streets today until as the Bible says of the rich young ruler in hell he lifted up his eyes it's interesting because the first time that that term was even used in the Bible give me Genesis 13 10 brothers brother Joe brother Matt somebody Genesis 13 10 the first time that term is used Genesis 13 10 is lot lifting up his eyes to Sodom Abraham had come to him and says you know you pick you choose and whatever you choose I'll go the other way and lot here it is first time in the Bible this term is used and lot lifted up his eyes now this is just like the rich young ruler he lifted up his eyes and he saw Abraham in hell he lifted up his eyes and lot lifted up his eyes and beheld all the plain of Jordan pay attention now watch this that it was well watered everywhere before the Lord destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah even as the Garden of Eden like the land of Egypt as thou comest and Azure so now I want you to catch something here what look like what would it look like to lot at that time was not how it would end it only looked like that at the moment little did he know God had a calendar and God had a tenth and God had a calculator and God had been keeping a record of the sins of Sodom and Gomorrah and what what exacerbated what is the real Grindr of it is that God had blessed them with abundance and beauty and fern fertile and rainin and the land was fertile in the it was beautiful like Egypt andhe's or it was gorgeous and the people instead of being thankful to God got fat and became decadent and became perverted and God was keeping a record I was keeping a record and it was it was being amplified by powers of magnitude because they they had been given so much that it made their sin that much more egregious and he lifted up his eyes like they are doing today to what look like success but it but they didn't realize that prophecy was going to come to pass and it wasn't going to take all that long and everything that he thought he was seeing was was a mirage it was just a fake it way it looked real at the time and you can even put your finger on things today I know you could I'm not I'm not dumb I know that we could put our things on things in the world ago well this ain't bad this ain't bad this is good and this is good and you got to give credit this Shore they were good they had beauty it was true it was real but it wasn't gonna last because their sin was going to undo it and God was going to destroy it what a faithful decision what made when he lifted up his eyes and looked to the world's beauty what it looked like was not how it would end that's a principle we need to learn well and think about it think about a young person think about a teenager not here too so you but I'm here to tell you that you are your your largely unaware your your eyesight of life it just isn't keen enough yet to discern the mirages of life yet many times even even your elders many times even your elders have a hard time not learning the lessons that life has taught them I've failed to learn lessons even and I'm I'm 57 soon be 57 years old been reading God's Word since a boy hearing its story since a boy believing it since a child and even today I still stumble and make the same mistakes twice so think about a young person think about a teenager let me give you the best advice I could ever give you if you never hear brother Jason again you'll go away with the best advice I could ever give you make this your road map make this your guide make this what you live your life because this isn't fake and this isn't passing away what it looks like now is what it'll look like in a hundred years hallelujah oh my from this false dream of life to Lucifer's nightmare that you don't wake up from until Judgment Day you're bound over for trial people you know you get asked as a preacher people finding your preacher your chaplain they see this they start asking questions you know what about Hell what about heaven what about God what about the devil what about this what about that you know I think we need to have a ready answer so I study we need to have a studied answer the world needs an answer that makes sense and we've got the answers that make sense hell is certainly a real place people really go there God doesn't send them there they go there in spite of his efforts to keep him from going there he didn't build hell for men for men hell hath enlarged itself because it isn't overcrowded prison and had to receive people and it was never built for that it was built for the devil and his angels and so you know from from this false dream say well well is it a burning flow no not yet it's not a literal lake of fire what is it you're bound over for trial just like if you got convicted of a if you got arrested tomorrow and you'd be bound over for trial unless you could bail out er our RoR or somebody put up a lot of money to let you get out and then you still have to hang around and show up in court in other words but if you can you're bound over and I'm here to tell you you go to the devil's prison house what we call Hell nobody's paying your bail there's there's no such thing as praying you out of purgatory I'm here to tell you I don't care how much mama cries at your funeral you're not getting bailed out you're bound over for trial it's a false dream today this life that it's Lucifer's nightmare from a false dream of life to a nightmare you can't wake up from you're bound over for trial until the day of judgment let's say you this morning courtroom have I made my case have I made my case I started out saying this is a sad world and I'm gonna prove it today oh I'm here to tell you about another world that's not sad I'm here to tell you that even in this life you can have joy unspeakable and full of glory that even your life here in Satan's dreamworld you can be alive you can be born again and be living and have a different master hallelujah and I love it now let's carry on brother Joe and in verses 14 and 15 Genesis 13 14 15 now watching come to Abram law has already lifted up his eyes verse 14 and the Lord said unto Abram after that lot was separated from him lift up now thine eyes second time second time in history you find this statement lift up now thine eyes and look from the place where thou art northward and southward and eastward and westward for all the land which seest to thee will I give it and to thy seed forever I wanted to emphasize to you first Peter four four through six again so let me read it again for you from the New Living Translation don't bother putting it up for the brother Joe unless you have NLT but we read in 1st Peter 4 verses 4 through 6 now listen you used to run with these wild revellings and parties and drinks lasciviousness that's and and and all kinds of sinful decadence but Paul says but you don't run that way no more but here here you when you get born again you create a new paradigm because now the people that used to be your friends suddenly think you're weird they even criticize you I've had it happen I doubt if there's anybody in there who hasn't had that happen especially if you lived a life of sin and ran with the wrong people and now you're serving God they don't understand you anymore Paul says of course your former friends are surprised when you no longer plunge now let me let me set this up right because you're about to see a contrast between verse 4 and verses 5 and 6 ok so there's gonna be a contrast now watch of course your former friends think about Joe are surprised when you no longer plunge into the flood of wild and destructive things they do so they slander you you got that one but remember now watch the contrast but remember that they will have to face God who stands ready to judge everyone both the living and the dead that is why the good news was preached to those who are now dead so although then this is those who used to be dead who are now alive so although they were destined to die like all people you were destined to die just like them now they live forever with God in the spirit so in verse in verses five and six in contrast to verse four Peter is encouraging his readers with this fact that rather than facing judgment for their sins we all got him hey man we've all had them we all got them but Peters trying to encourage his readers that rather than facing judgment for your sins that like everybody else that those who had heard and believed the gospel of Jesus Christ faced a different future I'm here to tell you you facing a different future you had a sure future you're in Satan's dream of fake life you were headed to Satan's nightmare I bound over for trial no way to get out of it but now you have a different future hallelujah oh my friends in heaven that's where I'll have real life I'll never lust after fake life again this body will be changed in a moment thank God thank God thank God oh thank god let us come awake let me say to today let us come awake from Lucifer's dream the god of this evil age come away young people come awake old people snap out of his drink come up to real life come awake to the joys
