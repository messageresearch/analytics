[1:46] chapter 5
[1:48] first peter chapter 5. if you have your
[1:50] bible
[1:52] apologize we're a little bit late it's
[1:53] my fault i
[1:55] messed up on the schedule there we had a
[1:56] brother out of town
[1:58] and i felt to reschedule that spot so we
[2:01] were just trying to get the stream
[2:02] the recording going amen but we'd like
[2:05] to begin
[2:06] a series and i tried everything
[2:10] in my mind to be able to condense this
[2:13] into
[2:14] one teaching then i just felt that that
[2:16] was uh the lord just
[2:18] having me not do that so we're gonna
[2:20] break this up into a few and i'd like to
[2:22] speak to you
[2:23] i'm just going to title this series
[2:25] present darkness
[2:27] present darkness and we'd like to cover
[2:30] um at least there will be at least one
[2:33] more
[2:34] to this so i'm probably going to leave
[2:37] you on a cliffhanger and some of the
[2:38] things we're going to talk about are
[2:39] going to be a little heavy
[2:41] uh here today spoke to the brothers on
[2:44] some of these lines yesterday at the
[2:46] men's breakfast but i don't want to rush
[2:49] and i don't want to conclude so i may
[2:51] say a lot i may pose a lot of questions
[2:55] that we don't necessarily give direct
[2:58] answers to
[2:59] now but lord willing uh we'll
[3:02] wrap back around to some of those things
[3:04] and and come to a conclusion in other
[3:06] words
[3:06] you're only going to get half of it
[3:08] today and we may end on a cliffhanger
[3:10] but that's all right
[3:11] first peter chapter 5
[3:15] verse 8. i'd like you to turn to
[3:17] revelations 12 after that so let's read
[3:19] this first in first peter 5.
[3:22] be sober be vigilant
[3:25] because your adversary the devil
[3:29] as a roaring lion walketh about
[3:32] seeking whom he may devour revelations
[3:35] chapter 12
[3:36] i'll read one more scripture and i'll
[3:38] have you be seated
[3:47] revelations 12 12 brother joe when you
[3:50] have that
[3:53] and there appear to great uh that's yeah
[3:56] let's go to verse 12 that's verse 1
[3:58] verse 12 yeah
[4:02] therefore rejoice you heavens
[4:05] and you that dwell in them woe to the
[4:08] inhabiters of the earth so
[4:10] heavens rejoicing but woe to those on
[4:12] the earth well that's a problem because
[4:15] i don't know if y'all looked around
[4:16] lately we're not in heaven
[4:18] or right here on the earth the bible
[4:21] says
[4:21] woe to the inhabitants inhabiters of the
[4:25] earth
[4:26] and of the sea for the devil
[4:29] is come down unto you having great wrath
[4:33] because he knoweth he hath but a short
[4:36] time you can be seated
[4:42] we read in first peter chapter five and
[4:44] there's many scriptures we could use
[4:47] to describe our adversary to describe
[4:50] our foe the devil the bible uses many
[4:54] different
[4:54] terms but some of those we'll just save
[4:58] for today and we'll just read just a
[4:59] couple of these
[5:00] but in fur in john chapter 8 jesus
[5:04] refers to the devil and says he was a
[5:07] murderer
[5:08] from the beginning a murderer think
[5:10] about that that's a
[5:11] you can call a you can a person could be
[5:14] attributed or
[5:15] an adjective could be described to you
[5:17] to to uh speak of someone in a
[5:20] horrible way but a murderer and jesus
[5:22] says he's a murderer
[5:24] from the beginning first peter paul says
[5:28] be sober be vigilant because here's your
[5:30] adversary i'm going to describe him for
[5:32] you because
[5:33] you don't you've never met him face to
[5:35] face as you would meet a man
[5:37] you don't see him every single day you
[5:39] don't have a conversation with him
[5:42] but yet he's he's real yet he's
[5:45] um he's as real as any person that you
[5:48] could meet
[5:48] you would say a natural enemy that you
[5:50] have someone that you despise or someone
[5:52] that despises you
[5:54] but paul says i'm going to describe him
[5:56] for you
[5:57] he's like a roaring lion now remember
[6:01] that jesus is also typed as jehovah is
[6:03] typed as the lion
[6:05] of the tribe of judah but paul is using
[6:08] a com
[6:09] a completely different analogy
[6:12] or an illustration to describe the devil
[6:15] the lion that jesus has referred to is
[6:18] in power and in strength
[6:20] and in defense and as a protector as a
[6:23] lion of the tribe of judah
[6:24] but paul is using the devil and he's
[6:26] going to describe him
[6:28] as like a roaring lion if you ever seen
[6:32] a lion on the prowl or on the
[6:34] hunt and he's and he's and he's tr he's
[6:36] looking for
[6:37] for something to consume or something to
[6:39] just rip into
[6:41] and shred the pieces and if you've ever
[6:44] watched any national geographics and
[6:47] watch some of the
[6:48] images of a lion there's nothing that is
[6:51] more ferocious
[6:52] uh uh just a ferocious animal that when
[6:56] he
[6:56] when he when he attacks and he and he
[6:59] gets hold he subdues
[7:01] whatever it is that he's attacking he
[7:03] just
[7:04] he he he annihilates that
[7:07] animal immediately it's just almost
[7:09] instant death
[7:11] and this is what paul is describing when
[7:13] he says be sober
[7:15] christians believers be vigilant
[7:19] be sober be on guard be ready
[7:22] because your enemy who's attacking you
[7:25] is like a roaring lion seeking on the
[7:29] prowl on the hunt
[7:30] finding vulnerabilities looking for
[7:32] weaknesses looking for moments of
[7:34] weakness when he can
[7:36] attack and when he attacks
[7:39] his purpose is to murder amen
[7:44] now that's going to be really important
[7:46] as we go through some of this
[7:47] his purpose is murder
[7:51] he doesn't want to just hurt you or
[7:53] offend you
[7:54] or hurt your feelings or make your life
[7:58] a little bad and a little uncomfortable
[8:00] he
[8:00] he wants to murder you he wants to
[8:03] destroy you he's looking to destroy and
[8:05] jesus calls him that and says he's a
[8:07] murderer he's been a murderer
[8:10] from the beginning revelations 12 what
[8:12] are the inhabitants of the earth for the
[8:13] devil
[8:14] this roaring lion so the scripture
[8:17] paints
[8:17] this uh this adversary is a maniac
[8:21] just a a it one and and it's not just a
[8:24] not just a roaring lion as he uses that
[8:26] adjective but
[8:28] or that descriptor but he's a he's he
[8:31] knows he has but a short time
[8:34] he knows his time is running out and
[8:35] he's been unleashed
[8:37] upon the earth and upon the sea the
[8:39] scripture says
[8:41] i thought of this the lord began to deal
[8:43] with my heart and i spoke to the
[8:44] brothers yesterday about this
[8:45] at the breakfast it's it's incredible
[8:49] because
[8:50] i was i was watching a viewing
[8:52] documentary
[8:55] on the columbine high school shootings
[9:00] when two boys walked into a high school
[9:04] that they had attended and they felt the
[9:07] need to
[9:09] they they felt they were picked on and
[9:11] bullied and they were the outcasts
[9:13] and so they premeditated and concocted a
[9:16] plan
[9:17] to go into a school and take weapons and
[9:21] and just go on a rampage and murder
[9:26] and i i after watching that you know
[9:29] it's a it's incredible it's
[9:31] almost becomes a little surreal because
[9:33] we've been so
[9:34] inundated since that point with school
[9:37] shooting after school shooting and
[9:40] and just horrible things i was just it
[9:42] sort of spawned all this
[9:44] yesterday or the the i think it was
[9:45] friday and thursday or friday in the
[9:47] news
[9:48] maybe some of you read it about the man
[9:52] uh there who went into i think he worked
[9:54] at a railroad
[9:55] uh or a train station there and he went
[9:57] into his work
[9:58] and he and he there was a mass shooting
[10:00] there where he had he murdered
[10:02] several individuals wounded several
[10:04] others and
[10:06] it was incredible watching the door cam
[10:08] footage of
[10:09] the man from the neighbor who she had
[10:12] watched
[10:13] uh that not that she had watched but
[10:15] that camera had viewed
[10:17] for years of the same man going through
[10:19] the same routine
[10:20] walking out of his house in his work
[10:23] clothes his work garb
[10:25] he has an old ford truck he's walking in
[10:28] front of it he put
[10:28] loads of stuff in usually his coffee or
[10:30] whatever he has he gets in the
[10:32] driver's seat he starts the car always
[10:34] at the same time every day
[10:36] same routine going to work except this
[10:38] day
[10:39] the security camera footage shows him
[10:41] come out with a duffel bag and
[10:43] he very nonchalantly not in any kind of
[10:45] a rush
[10:46] opens the door like he always does loads
[10:48] of stuff grabs the duffel bag
[10:51] puts it in goes to the driver's side
[10:54] about the same exact time
[10:55] closes the door starts his truck except
[10:58] for in that duffel bag is multiple
[11:00] high-powered weapons and
[11:02] rifles and and pistols and and every
[11:05] kind of array of
[11:06] of weaponry to cause destruction
[11:10] and ruin and murder and it's almost
[11:13] surreal watching
[11:15] and i asked just watching these images
[11:18] how could a person
[11:21] how could a could a human being who
[11:24] is uh who who's in this who who operates
[11:28] in the same
[11:29] um world that i operate in go
[11:32] has the same emotions obviously had a
[11:35] father had a mother don't know his
[11:36] backstory don't know what happened there
[11:38] but how could a human being go into this
[11:41] railroad facility and just start
[11:43] shooting people and hearing some of the
[11:44] horror and stories of the survivors
[11:47] of one man who uh garnered a gathered a
[11:50] bunch of people into a room
[11:51] told them they went into shock and end
[11:53] up went into panic
[11:55] and he yells at them and tells them get
[11:56] out of here there's a shooter
[11:58] you got to get into this locked door and
[12:00] get behind it and he finally got him
[12:02] got all i think it was 10 or 11 of them
[12:04] put in there
[12:05] and before he could make it in the
[12:07] shooter was there and they watched him
[12:08] execute him right there in front of him
[12:11] saved all their life lost his
[12:15] watching the going through some of the
[12:19] women what would be memory
[12:22] for all of us here i think all of us
[12:24] maybe not not every individual but most
[12:26] of us here today
[12:28] would remember the columbine high school
[12:30] shootings
[12:32] and the the immediate when you mentioned
[12:35] that
[12:36] name columbine even that city
[12:39] uh that entire community
[12:42] has was destroyed their their reputation
[12:45] forever
[12:46] what that city is even known for and
[12:49] that
[12:50] is is those school shootings
[12:55] what was incredible as was is hearing
[12:58] the back story of those two boys
[13:00] that there was really didn't make rhyme
[13:02] or reason didn't make any sense
[13:04] didn't come to family you'd think they'd
[13:06] come from some home where
[13:08] you know they were there was some form
[13:09] of abuse or something and
[13:11] but really just a normal american
[13:14] family you know um
[13:18] uh you know just normal home raised and
[13:20] you think how could a
[13:22] how could a how could a person how could
[13:24] a human
[13:25] get to such a point to where these two
[13:28] boys would go and premeditate this
[13:30] entire thing and
[13:31] and plan the entire thing out and then
[13:33] go into the school
[13:35] and and then just one by one watching
[13:38] the
[13:38] cameras there was no it wasn't erratic
[13:40] behavior it wasn't
[13:42] it wasn't panicked it was controlled
[13:45] premeditated
[13:46] and cold and evil
[13:50] evil we look for the the rhyme or reason
[13:54] people uh has has tried to
[13:58] you know to diagnose and say how could a
[14:00] per what must have been the video
[14:02] games it must have been this there must
[14:03] have been some abuse or
[14:05] psychologically there's got to be
[14:06] something there wrong
[14:08] you know with and they what they what
[14:10] they they miss
[14:11] that in plain sight that what the answer
[14:15] is
[14:16] and all of those things that they name
[14:18] and we've got to go to congress get with
[14:20] our congressmen we got to change the
[14:22] laws we gotta
[14:23] and and all of these are a way because
[14:26] the
[14:26] human mind has to intellectually answer
[14:28] the question
[14:30] as not just to the how it happened but
[14:33] why why did it happen and we've got to
[14:36] have solutions we've got to prevent it
[14:38] we've got to
[14:39] be aware and and prevent this the next
[14:42] time
[14:44] and it's really just going for the
[14:46] symptoms and not the calls
[14:49] and the cause is evil the cause is
[14:53] present darkness that the world is
[14:56] surrounded in and engulfed in and that
[14:58] darkness the bible says
[14:59] is getting greater and to the point to
[15:02] where it calls it a gross darkness and
[15:05] it's not gross like the word
[15:06] yuck or disgusting but it's it's a form
[15:10] it's a metric of measurement that it's a
[15:13] thick exactly it's a thick gross
[15:16] heavy darkness
[15:22] what was probably the most sobering and
[15:25] we may not get too much more that's all
[15:27] right
[15:28] what was so sobering about watching that
[15:31] was
[15:32] the worst part was not necessarily to
[15:36] watch these boys and you watch the
[15:37] premeditation of
[15:39] you know these boys that would go into a
[15:41] girl and here she is praying on her
[15:43] knees and calling out to god and then he
[15:45] puts a gun to her head and pulls the
[15:46] trigger it's a horrible thing
[15:49] you think how how could a person the
[15:50] bible says that
[15:52] they would be without natural affection
[15:57] and it's almost a loss of how do you not
[15:59] have the natural affection of another a
[16:01] human being to another human being to
[16:03] where you can get so
[16:04] cold to where they had given way they
[16:07] had
[16:08] given over they had just like legion had
[16:11] started somewhere brother random calls
[16:13] him you know a man
[16:15] there with a family a husband and
[16:16] children an alcohol or something or a
[16:18] temper
[16:19] that he couldn't control and then one
[16:21] demon turns into two and turns into ten
[16:24] and one hundred and
[16:25] to where he has two thousand and he's a
[16:27] social
[16:28] outcast living in a cemetery
[16:32] and and just like that he had he had
[16:35] given a place to the devil and the devil
[16:37] had
[16:37] possessed his body brother travis used
[16:40] the example of judas
[16:41] yesterday that the bible says that and
[16:44] and satan
[16:46] now having entered the heart of judas
[16:48] iscariot simon's son to portray him
[16:50] so there was a moment when the devil
[16:52] entered him and now he's completely
[16:54] possessed by that
[16:56] spirit that he's worshiped or given
[16:58] place to
[16:59] but there was months there was years
[17:02] probably a track record of
[17:04] compromise or giving in to the devil
[17:08] it's amazing because as i said one of
[17:10] the most horrible things
[17:11] to try to reconcile or to to process was
[17:14] not necessarily
[17:16] the damage of the loss of those
[17:18] individuals those
[17:20] that numeric number uh at columbine
[17:23] of those who died and those who were
[17:25] injured but what was so shocking and
[17:27] what you
[17:28] what was uh i guess so sobering for me
[17:31] when i watched the documentary
[17:34] was not necessarily the worst part was
[17:37] not the loss of life there on that one
[17:41] day in one hour and six minutes whatever
[17:43] it was of
[17:44] of chaos but it was the
[17:47] trail of carnage of broken homes and
[17:50] broken families
[17:51] and suicides the amount of suicides
[17:55] of people and families who were
[17:57] connected to some of those children and
[17:59] some of the school staff that years
[18:02] later even as recent i think it was 2018
[18:05] of of of a suicide from that just
[18:08] living with years of that grief and
[18:11] trauma and that ptsd
[18:13] of that moment you know who you blame
[18:16] you blame dylan or the the you blame the
[18:19] individual boys do you blame the parents
[18:21] do you blame the schools you blame the
[18:23] guns
[18:24] you know what you do you just keep
[18:25] blaming and blaming and blaming
[18:27] and if you keep tracing it back and
[18:29] tracing it back and tracing it back and
[18:31] tracing it back you eventually land in
[18:32] the garden of eden
[18:35] and you blame you put the blame where it
[18:37] really belongs
[18:38] and that's to the devil the serpent
[18:42] because jesus says he was a murderer
[18:46] from the beginning he was a murderer
[18:49] from the beginning
[18:50] he's evil and evil possesses the hearts
[18:54] and minds of people
[18:57] the ravaged homes and the lives
[19:00] the pain of the family the heartbreak
[19:04] of of the of the brothers
[19:08] one man who goes around the country now
[19:10] because of how
[19:11] brutal he was and how how bullying she
[19:14] was to his sister
[19:16] i think he was i think he was 15
[19:20] and she was 12 or whatever age it was
[19:22] and she was the first
[19:24] one she was the first one shot at
[19:26] columbine on the stairs before the boys
[19:28] entered the school they shot her
[19:30] and he had spent a life of just
[19:31] despising her and picking on her and
[19:34] and impugning her her character whenever
[19:36] he could get in front of someone he just
[19:38] he would tell how nasty he was and now
[19:42] that boy has
[19:43] dealt with years he dealt with for
[19:45] almost a year of
[19:46] suicide tried several times to kill
[19:48] himself because he couldn't handle the
[19:49] grief
[19:50] of how he treated some his sister who's
[19:53] now
[19:53] gone and now he's lost her and and
[19:57] and now he goes around to school after
[19:59] school even today on
[20:00] and and speaks up to children about
[20:03] bullying and brothers and siblings and
[20:06] how you should treat and
[20:07] appreciate each other it's been
[20:10] it's been years of
[20:13] just collateral damage from that
[20:17] one moment that one hour
[20:21] and now there's there's lives and ruin
[20:24] and destruction
[20:26] and you know this is this is the devil's
[20:29] desire this is what he's after he's a
[20:32] raging
[20:33] maniac
[20:37] and and he's he wants to destroy
[20:40] and in any way he can destroy or afflict
[20:42] you or attack you in any possible way
[20:45] that he can
[20:46] he's there to destroy he's there
[20:50] the bible says woe unto the inhabitants
[20:53] of the earth for the devil has come down
[20:55] unto you having great wrath because he
[20:58] knows that he has but a short
[21:01] time brother branham's
[21:04] we spoke yesterday on this the prophet
[21:06] of god speaks to us about
[21:08] the seven dimension environment that man
[21:11] is constantly contacting
[21:14] and and from the from the in from the
[21:16] moment of the fall
[21:18] when time begins when when when there's
[21:20] a curse
[21:21] brought on humanity and that curse
[21:24] that's
[21:25] that is the serpent is going to be
[21:27] cursed
[21:29] but it's not just the serpent who's
[21:30] cursed but also the woman in
[21:32] in humanity adam and eve are
[21:36] cursed and the ground is cursed and the
[21:39] earth
[21:40] is cursed and everything in the world
[21:43] is cursed now the now the
[21:46] the the the woman and the man will work
[21:50] by the sweat of his brow you remember
[21:52] the scripture when
[21:53] they're in the garden when when the god
[21:55] is speaking and says
[21:57] now and labor and sweat and toil and it
[22:00] won't yield a it'll yield
[22:01] thistles and thorns unto you
[22:06] but further than that it wasn't just the
[22:08] earth but man was also brought under
[22:10] a sin curse and he's lives he lives
[22:14] under that sin curse the world is
[22:18] cursed we we we we can speak of many
[22:21] types of of evil in the world and we
[22:25] probably shouldn't do that it's probably
[22:27] gonna be a
[22:28] hard spot to segue so let's stand we're
[22:31] out of time
[22:32] i told you i'd leave you on a
[22:33] cliffhanger
[22:37] lord we hear these some of these
[22:39] sobering thoughts that we brought to our
[22:42] mind
[22:43] lord but it's the reality of this
[22:45] present darkness this world that we have
[22:47] to live in
[22:48] lord but you placed us here for a
[22:50] purpose
[22:52] for a reason we spoke last sunday on
[22:54] salt and light
[22:55] and you said you are the salt of the
[22:58] earth
[22:58] you are the light and man doesn't take a
[23:01] light and light a candle and hide it
[23:02] under a bushel
[23:04] but he sets it like a city upon a hill
[23:07] lord in this present world we're so
[23:10] grateful that we have a lighthouse
[23:14] that we have a refuge that we can turn
[23:16] to
[23:17] we have a place lord that we can live
[23:19] where there's protection from the wrath
[23:21] and the evil
[23:23] that the devil the apostle paul says
[23:25] therefore
[23:26] wherefore put on the whole armor of god
[23:30] because your battle is real your enemy
[23:33] is real
[23:34] so put on the whole armor because your
[23:37] adversary our battle is not against
[23:39] flesh and blood
[23:40] but it's against spiritual wickedness
[23:43] evil in high places
[23:46] so lord help us every day to put on the
[23:48] whole armor of god to be sober to be
[23:50] vigilant
[23:51] as the book of peter says because our
[23:53] adversary is a roaring
[23:55] lion seeking whom whom he may devour
[23:58] help us lord every day to put on that
[24:00] whole armor
[24:02] whereby we may be able to withstand the
[24:04] fiery darts of the enemy
[24:06] granted lord jesus i pray for this
[24:08] service for the
[24:09] singing the worship lord the minister
[24:11] and of your word
[24:12] i pray that you'd bless it now in jesus
[24:14] name amen
[24:37] you
