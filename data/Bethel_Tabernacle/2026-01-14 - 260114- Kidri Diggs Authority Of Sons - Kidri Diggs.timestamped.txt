[3:51] Heat.
[4:02] Heat.
[4:28] This poor man cried. Amen. Praise the
[4:31] Lord. Love the Lord. This evening,
[4:35] I was instructed to give a little
[4:39] uh announcement. Announcement. That's
[4:41] what it was. Um, we just want to um
[4:46] remind those with little babies that um
[4:49] we don't want to be feeding food in the
[4:51] sanctuary.
[4:53] Now, if you have little dry cereals and
[4:56] things, something that's a little
[4:57] inconsistent,
[4:58] not inconsistent, that's not the word.
[5:00] Inconspicuous
[5:02] is the word. That would be okay. Babies
[5:05] with bottles is that's another thing.
[5:07] But um we have some chairs that are
[5:10] getting some stains on them and stuff
[5:11] from food. So um it's also why we don't
[5:15] want no crayons in the sanctuary because
[5:17] sometimes they get left behind. They get
[5:19] stepped into the carpet.
[5:21] And um we're not going to mention gum.
[5:24] I'm just kidding. Come on. It's okay.
[5:27] Little levity ain't going to hurt you.
[5:28] Praise the Lord. But so we just uh no
[5:32] eating food in the sanctuary. We know
[5:34] that. But we just kind of remind as we
[5:36] go along. Amen.
[5:38] Let's pray.
[5:41] I love you, Lord.
[5:43] I thank you for your grace and mercy to
[5:45] me and to my brothers and sisters this
[5:48] evening.
[5:50] Lord, we just come together to worship
[5:52] you in spirit and in truth. Present
[5:55] ourselves before you, Lord, that you
[5:57] would draw us closer to you. Cut off
[6:01] those things that need to be cut off.
[6:03] Encourage the hearts.
[6:06] fill us again with thy holy spirit.
[6:08] Father,
[6:10] we just pray that you would be pleased
[6:12] with our worship, our hearts this
[6:14] evening.
[6:16] Father, we do want to continue to
[6:18] remember our sick and needy this
[6:20] evening. We love you, Lord. We worship
[6:23] you in spirit and truth. As we collect
[6:27] the tithes and offerings, I pray that
[6:28] you bless the cheerful giver of those
[6:30] that are streaming. Let the word have
[6:33] preeminence. Let it do its work. We pray
[6:35] in Jesus name. Amen.
[6:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. Would you turn really quick and
[6:43] just look somebody in the eyes and say,
[6:45] "God bless you."
[6:49] Amen.

[12:19] traveling on
[12:23] which way.

[14:20] Amen. Sister Brenda, won't you come and
[14:22] give us a song this evening? Amen. You
[14:25] can be seated.
[14:27] Amen. Sister Brenda, let's give her a
[14:28] hand. Amen.
[15:19] Out on the water,
[15:23] storms raging high.
[15:26] The waters around them were troubled
[15:32] that night
[15:34] and fear filled their heart.
[15:38] They thought they would die, but they
[15:42] failed to remember.
[15:46] The master was nigh and he spoke the
[15:51] word
[15:53] and the winds all stood still.
[15:57] Even the waters
[16:01] they obeyed his will.
[16:04] He calmed their storm
[16:08] just like he will mine.
[16:11] If I'll just remember
[16:14] that he lives deep inside.
[16:19] So why should I worry?
[16:23] Why should I fear when the very same
[16:28] Jesus,
[16:30] he stays always near. He lives in my
[16:35] heart
[16:37] and he hears when I cry. I'll call on
[16:42] his name till the storm passes by.
[16:52] We read in the Bible
[16:56] how he walked with them, brought light
[17:00] to their darkness
[17:03] when their way grew so dear. How great
[17:07] it would be
[17:10] to have his steps leading
[17:13] mine and to walk with the master
[17:18] all of the time.
[17:21] So when trials come
[17:25] and death seems so nigh, I'll search for
[17:30] the master. He said he'd be there on
[17:35] time. And when I'm in trouble
[17:39] and my body's in pain,
[17:44] all I have to do
[17:47] is call
[17:49] his name. Why should I worry?
[17:55] Why should I fear? Very same Jesus,
[18:02] he stays always near. He lives in my
[18:07] heart
[18:09] and he hears when I cry. I'll call on
[18:14] his name till the storm passes by.
[18:20] So why should I worry? And why should I
[18:26] fear when the very same Jesus?
[18:31] He stays always
[18:33] near. He lives in my heart
[18:38] and he hears me when I cry.
[18:42] Call on his name till the storm passes
[18:47] by.
[18:52] And I'll call on his name
[19:00] till the storm passes by.
[19:19] key F. Please,
[19:26] won't you stand with me? Sing a little
[19:28] bit of heart of worship. Amen.
[19:34] When the music fades
[19:38] and all is stripped away
[19:42] and the simple come,
[19:50] longing just to bring
[19:54] something that's a word
[19:57] that will bless your heart.
[20:04] I'll bring you more than a song.
[20:09] For a song in itself is not what you
[20:14] have required.
[20:20] You search much deeper within
[20:25] through the way things appear. You're
[20:28] looking into my heart.
[20:35] I'm coming back to the heart of worship
[20:42] when it's all about you.
[20:47] All about you, Jesus.
[20:51] I'm sorry, Lord, for things I made
[20:58] when it's all about you.
[21:02] All about you, Jesus.
[21:11] King of endless world.
[21:16] No one could express
[21:19] how much you deserve.
[21:26] Though we can hold
[21:31] and all I have is yours.
[21:34] Every single breath
[21:41] I'll bring you more than a song.
[21:46] For a song in itself is not what you
[21:51] have required.
[21:57] You search much deeper within
[22:01] through the way things are. You're
[22:05] looking into my heart.
[22:12] I'm coming back to the heart of worship
[22:19] when it's all about you.
[22:23] All about you, Jesus.
[22:27] I'm sorry, Lord, for being found
[22:34] when it's all about you.
[22:38] all about you, Jesus.
[22:42] I'm coming back to the heart of worship.
[22:49] When it's all about you,
[22:53] all about you, Jesus.
[22:58] I'm sorry, Lord, for things I made
[23:04] when it's all about you.
[23:09] All about you, Jesus.
[23:17] Let's give the Lord another praise
[23:19] offering.
[23:23] &gt;&gt; How many is ready for the word now?
[23:26] Let's sing. Because he lives, I can face
[23:28] tomorrow. Is Brother Diggs come? Amen.
[23:32] Because
[23:34] he lives,
[23:40] I can face
[23:43] tomorrow
[23:48] because
[23:50] he lives.
[23:54] All fear is gone
[24:02] because I know
[24:09] he holds my future.
[24:16] Our life
[24:18] is worth
[24:20] the living
[24:22] just because
[24:25] he lives. Let's get the Lord away for
[24:28] humans. And because he lives,
[24:36] I can
[24:43] be
[24:50] Heat. Heat. Heat.
[25:00] Oh
[25:06] my
[25:13] word.
[25:18] Because he lives across the building.
[25:31] I can face you all.
[25:54] I know.
[26:01] I
[26:14] love
[26:22] Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord.
[26:26] And life is worth living because he
[26:28] lives. Amen. It's good to be home again.
[26:32] Certainly appreciate all of you coming
[26:35] out. Amen. To be in the house of the
[26:38] Lord.
[26:39] &gt;&gt; God.
[26:40] &gt;&gt; You know, I'm I'm to a place where
[26:43] every time I come to church, I expect to
[26:45] see God.
[26:48] &gt;&gt; If you don't come with that mindset,
[26:50] it's just tradition to you.
[26:53] But when we gather, we gather as
[26:55] children of God. We ought to expect to
[26:57] see our father.
[26:58] &gt;&gt; Our gathering is not in vain. Amen. We
[27:01] certainly appreciate Pastor Jason. Amen.
[27:04] And governments of the church. Let's
[27:07] just have a word of prayer and we'll get
[27:08] right into the word of God. If you have
[27:10] a need, you can acknowledge it by
[27:11] uplifted hand. Let's pray. Lord Jesus,
[27:14] Father, like the song says, because you
[27:16] live, we can face tomorrow, Lord.
[27:19] Lord, and we don't face it in our own
[27:21] human ability, but we face it knowing
[27:24] that you live, Lord. And whatever we
[27:27] stand in need of, Father, you've already
[27:29] done it, Lord. You've already, Lord,
[27:32] brought us out of the pawn shop. You
[27:34] pleaded our case. You became our
[27:36] &gt;&gt; judge, jury,
[27:39] everything, Lord God, that would beset
[27:40] us, Lord. You took care of it. So, Lord,
[27:44] here we are as your people, Lord, the
[27:46] sheep in your pasture. Father, we just
[27:49] pray that you would lay your hands upon
[27:51] us tonight, Lord.
[27:54] Lord, naturally and spiritually, Father,
[27:56] and mold us, Lord, make us fit for the
[28:00] master's use, Lord.
[28:02] &gt;&gt; Lord, if there's anything, Lord, you
[28:03] find anything in us, Lord, that doesn't
[28:05] reflect you, Lord, remove it, Lord, and
[28:09] replace them with something refreshing
[28:10] of thy spirit, Lord. And Lord, as we say
[28:14] so many times, Lord, forgive us for our
[28:16] sins and trespasses, Lord. Lord, in the
[28:19] areas in our lives, Lord, that we may
[28:21] struggle with that no one sees but you.
[28:24] Father, we plead your blood right now.
[28:27] &gt;&gt; Lord, in a multitude of sin,
[28:30] Lord God, we just pray that the Holy
[28:33] Spirit would dominate the service, Lord,
[28:35] that you will become even more real to
[28:37] us than you've already been.
[28:40] wonderful and masterless name of Jesus
[28:42] Christ we pray. The church say amen.
[28:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. Those of you have your Bibles,
[28:49] let's turn to um Matthew chapter 16.
[28:56] Matthew 16.
[29:08] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen.
[29:13] &gt;&gt; You know Jesus in this verse of
[29:14] scripture asked them, "Who do men say I
[29:18] am?"
[29:19] &gt;&gt; You know, and
[29:22] they identified with they they
[29:23] identified him with what somebody else
[29:26] was saying
[29:27] &gt;&gt; at the time,
[29:29] you know, a reflection of what other
[29:31] people thought.
[29:32] &gt;&gt; But then in verse 16,
[29:37] no, let's back up to verse 15.
[29:42] Matthew 16:15, the Bible says, "He saith
[29:45] unto them,
[29:47] but whom say ye that I am?"
[29:51] &gt;&gt; Somebody got to answer that question.
[29:54] But in the midst of that, the Bible
[29:56] says, "And Simon Peter answered and
[29:58] said, Thou art the Christ, the Son of
[30:01] the living God." And Jesus answered and
[30:05] said unto him, "Blessed art thou Simon
[30:08] by Jonah."
[30:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[30:11] &gt;&gt; If I could just put in there, this this
[30:14] is not in the scripture, but
[30:16] Jesus is saying, "Blessed art thou Simon
[30:21] by John by Jonah, for you know who I
[30:24] am." Right.
[30:27] &gt;&gt; He says, "For flesh and blood have not
[30:29] revealed it unto thee, but my father
[30:32] which is in heaven. And I say also unto
[30:36] thee that thou art Peter, and upon this
[30:39] rock I will build my church, and the
[30:42] gates of hell shall not prevail against
[30:45] it.
[30:47] And I will give unto thee the keys of
[30:50] the kingdom of heaven."
[30:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. And whatsoever thou shalt bind on
[30:54] earth shall be bound in heaven. And
[30:58] whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth
[31:00] shall be loosed in heaven. Then charge
[31:03] he his disciples that they should tell
[31:07] no man that he was Jesus the Christ.
[31:12] Let's go to Acts
[31:14] chapter one.
[31:18] Acts chapter 1 verse 8. familiar verse
[31:20] of scripture.
[31:25] The Bible says Acts 1:8, it says, "But
[31:28] ye shall receive power after the Holy
[31:32] Ghost is upon you, and ye shall be
[31:35] witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem, and
[31:39] in Judea, in Samaria, and unto the
[31:41] uttermost part of the earth." Amen. May
[31:45] the Lord bless reading of his word. You
[31:46] can have your seats.
[31:49] Amen.
[31:51] Tonight I want to use for a subject
[31:54] authority of sons.
[31:57] &gt;&gt; Authority of sons. I think uh I don't
[32:02] necessarily want to have to pull up the
[32:04] word of what authority means. I think we
[32:07] got a good idea of what authority means.
[32:11] But I think we need to reflect a little
[32:13] bit. Man was created to have authority.
[32:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[32:18] &gt;&gt; We don't we don't we I think we mistake
[32:21] sometimes. Yes, the Bible does say that
[32:24] he gave up to us power. But in that
[32:28] scripture that that particular word
[32:30] power means exusia
[32:33] and that means authority.
[32:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[32:35] &gt;&gt; You know and God has given us authority.
[32:37] Amen. NOW YOU THINK ABOUT IT AS MY
[32:40] SUBTITLE IS uh who are you? Hallelujah.
[32:45] &gt;&gt; You know, knowing know as sons as sons
[32:47] of God and having authority, I THINK
[32:51] IT'S TIME FOR US TO TO exercise
[32:54] &gt;&gt; and knowing who we are.
[32:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[32:57] &gt;&gt; Now, I want to I WANT TO JUST GIVE YOU A
[32:58] LITTLE INSIGHT, you know, and and where
[33:01] this thought came from. You know, I was
[33:03] at the gym when I was working out and I
[33:04] was listening to some music and THAT
[33:06] SONG CAME ON. I KNOW WHO I AM.
[33:09] HALLELUJAH. AMEN.
[33:10] &gt;&gt; And you know, and it and it just would
[33:12] not leave MY SPIRIT. HALLELUJAH. THAT
[33:14] SONG SAYS, "I'M WALKING IN POWER."
[33:18] &gt;&gt; I I I I work in miracles.
[33:23] I know who I am. Hallelujah.
[33:26] &gt;&gt; But to do to exercise in that level of
[33:28] faith, you have to know who you are.
[33:31] Amen. And I THINK ONE THING THAT GOD HAS
[33:34] done through the preaching of the word
[33:36] of the hour, he's come to restore unto
[33:40] us, hallelujah, THE TRUE IDENTITY of who
[33:44] sons and daughters are.
[33:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But what I WANT US TO
[33:49] REFLECT ON TONIGHT is do we operate,
[33:52] HALLELUJAH, FROM THE HOUSEHOLD OF GOD
[33:55] WHICH WE CAME FROM?
[33:57] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. Think about it. as a son or
[34:00] as a daughter in a particular house.
[34:03] When you're hungry, YOU CAN JUST GO TO
[34:05] the refrigerator and eat.
[34:07] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[34:08] &gt;&gt; Talk to me, somebody.
[34:09] &gt;&gt; You don't have to go pray about it.
[34:12] &gt;&gt; If it if it's nothing that's going TO
[34:13] MAKE YOU SICK, YOU DON'T EVEN NEED

[35:02] &gt;&gt; And I and I'm sure you've uh it may have
[35:04] been an alert to what brother Matt sent
[35:07] out about come to church. Hallelujah.
[35:09] What that was about was COME TO CHURCH
[35:12] WITH EXPECTATION.
[35:14] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. WE'RE NOT WAITING ON A
[35:17] PARTICULAR THING TO HAPPEN. YOU CAN MAKE
[35:19] it happen.

[35:51] READ YOU SOMETHING. AMEN.
[35:53] In a nutshell where we're going tonight,
[35:56] the prophet of God, he says in um this
[35:59] is in wisdom versus faith. Hallelujah.
[36:02] He says, "THEN IF JESUS DEFEATED SATAN,"
[36:06] HALLELUJAH. HOW many would just love to
[36:08] know that the enemy was defeated?
[36:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:12] &gt;&gt; Half of us, half of us,
[36:15] &gt;&gt; ALL OF US ARE GOING THROUGH SOMETHING.
[36:17] And wouldn't it do you some real real
[36:19] good TO KNOW THAT YOUR ENEMY WAS
[36:22] DEFEATED?
[36:24] &gt;&gt; NO MATTER HOW MUCH HE RAISED HIS HEAD,
[36:26] NO MATTER HOW MUCH HE TALKED, NO MATTER
[36:28] WHAT HE'S DONE IN THE PAST, TO KNOW THIS
[36:30] VERY MOMENT, HALLELUJAH, IN BETHL
[36:33] TABERNACLE, YOUR ENEMY, THE DEVIL, IS
[36:36] DEFEATED.

[36:55] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[37:00] &gt;&gt; He says, "Then if Jesus defeated SATAN
[37:04] UPON THE FAITH, HALLELUJAH, KNOWING WHO
[37:08] HE WAS," HALLELUJAH.
[37:10] &gt;&gt; Oh my. Jesus defeated the enemy simply
[37:14] BY KNOWING WHO HE WAS.
[37:17] &gt;&gt; HE DIDN'T HAVE TO UH UH DO SOMETHING
[37:19] SPECIAL. HE DIDN'T HAVE TO HAVE FIRE
[37:21] COME OUT HIS HAND. ALL HE HAD TO DO WAS
[37:23] BY THE REVELATION OF GOD KNOW WHO HE IS.
[37:27] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[37:29] &gt;&gt; AND THERE WERE MANY OF TIMES,
[37:30] HALLELUJAH, WHERE JESUS WOULD COME AND
[37:32] HE SAID, HALLELUJAH, WHEN YOU SEE ME,
[37:35] YOU SEE THE FATHER.
[37:37] &gt;&gt; HE WAS CERTAIN
[37:39] &gt;&gt; WHO HE WAS.
[37:45] knowing who he was. He was
[37:48] predestinated. He was a predestinated
[37:50] creature. Are you ready?
[37:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:55] &gt;&gt; The prophet says, the congregation says,
[37:57] "Amen." Thank you, brother Luther.
[37:59] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[38:01] &gt;&gt; Are you ready?
[38:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:04] &gt;&gt; Are you ready?
[38:06] &gt;&gt; I'm going to SAY IT AGAIN. WE ARE NOT IN
[38:08] AN INSURANCE SEMINAR.
[38:11] THIS IS A NEW YEAR AND WE OUGHT TO BE
[38:13] EXPECTING MANIFESTATION.
[38:17] &gt;&gt; HONEY, WHEN WE COME TO CHURCH, WE GOT A
[38:19] PROMISE WHERE THE BIBLE SAYS WHEREVER
[38:21] TWO OR THREE ARE GATHERED, THERE WILL
[38:24] ALSO BE IN THE MIDST. NOW, DO YOU
[38:26] BELIEVE GOD IS HERE?
[38:28] &gt;&gt; AND IF YOU BELIEVE IT, I'LL ASK THE
[38:30] QUESTION, ARE YOU READY FOR HIM TO MOVE?
[38:35] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. RIGHT NOW
[38:37] &gt;&gt; IN THIS VERY MOMENT.
[38:39] &gt;&gt; WHATEVER'S HALLELUJAH AFFECTING YOUR
[38:41] LUNGS, WE TAKE AUTHORITY OVER IT RIGHT
[38:44] NOW IN THE NAME OF JESUS.
[38:47] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[38:49] &gt;&gt; I'M A SON.
[38:51] &gt;&gt; ARE YOU A SON?
[38:52] &gt;&gt; SO YOU CAN TAKE AUTHORITY over it
[38:55] &gt;&gt; in the name of Jesus Christ.
[38:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[39:00] &gt;&gt; It's too often we learn to live with
[39:03] what's bothering us.
[39:05] Hallelujah.
[39:06] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[39:07] &gt;&gt; JOSHUA DIDN'T DO THAT. AND JOSHUA WAS A
[39:10] TYPE OF THE HOLY SPIRIT. HALLELUJAH.
[39:12] WHEN JOSHUA LOST THE BATTLE, JOSHUA
[39:15] CALLED A SOLEMN ASSEMBLY AND SAID,
[39:17] "SOMETHING'S WRONG."
[39:19] &gt;&gt; CUZ AS A SON, I GOT AUTHORITY AND I'M
[39:22] NOT SUPPOSED TO LOSE ANY BATTLE.
[39:24] &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT.
[39:25] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[39:26] &gt;&gt; We're not supposed to lose.
[39:28] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[39:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:29] &gt;&gt; When you know who you are.
[39:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And what I love about
[39:34] Joshua,
[39:36] oh my church, I ain't going to be long.
[39:40] You know why I ain't going to be long?
[39:42] &gt;&gt; Cuz I will get a Holy Spirit time to do
[39:44] what he said he would do.
[39:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Church, what I love about
[39:49] Joshua, Joshua went to battle and lost
[39:53] against Ai. Some of you are losing the
[39:55] battle right now against Ai.
[39:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Joshua lost the battle
[40:01] against Ai, but then he WENT BACK AND
[40:04] CHECKED the whole assembly and said,
[40:05] "Hey, I don't know about y'all, but I
[40:07] ain't USED TO LOSING. GOD GAVE ME A
[40:10] PROMISE. GOD GAVE ME A WORD." AND THAT
[40:13] WORD HAS TO BECOME A PERSONAL
[40:15] REVELATION.
[40:17] &gt;&gt; JOSHUA COULDN'T GO BY WHO WAS SCARED AND
[40:19] WHO WAS AFRAID. ALL HE COULD DO, CHRIS,
[40:21] WAS GO BY WHAT GOD TOLD HIM. AND GOD
[40:24] TOLD HIM, "BE STRONG AND VERY
[40:26] COURAGEOUS." AMEN.
[40:29] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[40:30] &gt;&gt; HE SAID, "I'VE CALLED YOU TO TAKE THE
[40:32] PEOPLE INTO THE PROMISED LAND." SO WHEN
[40:34] JOSHUA LOST THE BATTLE, HALLELUJAH. WHEN
[40:36] THE REVELATION KICKED IN, THE VERY
[40:39] BATTLE HE LOST, HE WENT BACK TO IT.
[40:42] &gt;&gt; LOOKED THE ENEMY STRAIGHT IN THE FACE
[40:44] AND HE TOOK AUTHORITY
[40:48] &gt;&gt; over the enemy as a son.
[40:50] &gt;&gt; Who are you?
[40:51] &gt;&gt; Are you any different from Joshua?
[40:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:58] Amen.
[41:00] &gt;&gt; Thank you, brother.
[41:02] Oh my. He said he was predestinated
[41:05] creature. Are you Are you ready?
[41:09] &gt;&gt; Thank you, brother Luther.
[41:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[41:14] You see how we do when it come to
[41:15] spiritual things. We go in and out,
[41:18] &gt;&gt; in and out, in and out. LET'S ENGAGE.
[41:21] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. LET'S ENGAGE. LET'S TAP IN.
[41:24] LET'S LET THE ENEMY KNOW I AIN'T SITTING
[41:26] DOWN ANYMORE.
[41:27] &gt;&gt; I'M LOOKING AT YOU FACE TO FACE CUZ I
[41:30] KNOW WHO I AM.
[41:32] &gt;&gt; I'M NOT AFRAID OF YOU. HALLELUJAH. I AM
[41:34] A SON.
[41:35] &gt;&gt; I HAVE AUTHORITY. HIS SPIRIT LIVES IN
[41:38] ME. THE SAME LIFE THAT DEFEATED YOU IN
[41:41] HEAVEN, KICKED YOU DOWN TO EARTH AND
[41:43] DEFEATED YOU AGAIN IS NOW LIVING IN ME.
[41:46] SO I'M NOT AFRAID OF YOU.
[41:49] &gt;&gt; I got authority.
[41:52] Amen.
[41:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[41:56] &gt;&gt; As a son,
[41:58] he says, "Are you ready?"
[42:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:02] &gt;&gt; Thank you, sister.
[42:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[42:07] What about the predestinated bride of
[42:09] Jesus Christ? Now,
[42:11] &gt;&gt; you believe the bride is predestinated.
[42:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:14] &gt;&gt; The predestinated bride of Christ. Now

[43:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[43:29] &gt;&gt; I've been commissioned
[43:31] &gt;&gt; to preach deliverance ministry.

[43:46] HALLELUJAH. TO PUT THE ENEMY UNDER OUR
[43:48] FEET TONIGHT.
[43:53] &gt;&gt; But the thing of it is is we come to
[43:55] church and don't expect God to move.
[44:01] &gt;&gt; Like I said, we're sons
[44:03] &gt;&gt; and daughters. When you go in the
[44:05] refrigerator, you expect to eat.
[44:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:11] Oh my. He said the promises he put in
[44:15] the church in it right now. It's in it
[44:18] now. Everything is in order. Oh, BROTHER
[44:22] JESUS, I'M FIGHTING THIS BATTLE AND MY
[44:23] CHILDREN THIS AND MY JOB this and oh,
[44:26] I'M JUST FIGHTING THIS BATTLE.
[44:28] EVERYTHING IS IN ORDER RIGHT NOW.
[44:31] &gt;&gt; GOD IS TRYING TO RAISE YOU UP.
[44:33] HALLELUJAH. BROTHER KING, WILL YOU LOOK
[44:35] AT IT FACE TO FACE AND SAY, "SATAN, I
[44:37] KNOW WHO I AM. I AM A CHILD OF GOD. NOT
[44:41] JUST A CHILD OF GOD, A REDEEMED CHILD OF
[44:44] GOD.
[44:45] &gt;&gt; THAT MEANS I'M WALKING IN POWER.
[44:49] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[44:51] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[44:56] &gt;&gt; Everything is in order. The Holy Spirit
[44:58] has been given. The seed has been sown.
[45:03] The evening light has been shining.
[45:05] Somebody say, "Amen."
[45:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We've had the evening light,
[45:09] THE MESSAGE OF THE HOUR, 50 PLUS YEARS.
[45:14] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[45:15] &gt;&gt; AND YOU LOOK AT ONE OF THE ONE OF THE
[45:17] FIRST FRUIT THAT CAME OUT OF THE
[45:19] VINEYARD. HALLELUJAH. HE WASN'T AFRAID
[45:21] OF DEMONS.
[45:23] &gt;&gt; WHY? CUZ HE KNEW WHO HE WAS.
[45:25] &gt;&gt; EVEN IN THIS RESTING TIME WHEN HE WAS
[45:27] VISITED BY THE DEVIL, HE WOULD LOOK OVER
[45:29] AND SAY, "OH, THAT'S JUST YOU, SATAN.
[45:32] YOU CAN'T EVEN GET IN MY DREAMS UNLESS I
[45:34] ALLOW IT.
[45:37] HALLELUJAH.
[45:39] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[45:41] &gt;&gt; When are we going to stop making Satan
[45:43] more powerful than what he is?
[45:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:47] &gt;&gt; He's only as powerful as we surrender
[45:49] him TO BE.
[45:51] &gt;&gt; YOU MAKE HIM WHAT HE IS.
[45:54] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. CUZ GOD HAS ALREADY DEFEATED
[45:57] HIM.
[45:58] &gt;&gt; YOU MAKE CANCER POWERFUL. YOU MAKE HIGH
[46:01] BLOOD POWER, HYPERTENSION, WHATEVER IT
[46:03] IS. YOU MAKE ANXIETY POWERFUL. GOD
[46:06] ALREADY DEALT WITH ALL OF THAT WITH HIS
[46:08] AUTHORITY ON CALVARY'S CROSS. HE
[46:11] CRUCIFIED IT.
[46:14] &gt;&gt; DEALT WITH IT.
[46:15] &gt;&gt; DONE AND OVER.
[46:17] &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT.
[46:18] &gt;&gt; The only way it comes back is if you let
[46:20] it back.
[46:25] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[46:28] &gt;&gt; Listen.
[46:29] So what is it, Brother Jigs?
[46:32] How do I get there? Hallelujah. If God
[46:35] has unleashed this authority, how do I
[46:39] get there with all these mistakes I got?
[46:42] &gt;&gt; How do I get there with all these
[46:43] battles and all these fears in my life?
[46:46] How do I get there? I'm not a preacher.
[46:48] I'm not A DEACON. HOW DO I GET THERE?
[46:52] &gt;&gt; LISTEN,
[46:54] this is an exposition of the church age.
[46:58] He said as I have already said this book
[47:02] Revelations
[47:04] is the the consummation
[47:07] of scripture.
[47:08] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[47:09] &gt;&gt; It is EVEN PLACED EXACTLY RIGHT in the
[47:13] canon of scripture at the end. Now you
[47:17] can know why it says that anyone who
[47:20] reads or even hears it is blessed.
[47:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. WOO.
[47:28] &gt;&gt; HOW MANY CHURCHES THAT ARE OUT THERE,
[47:31] HOW MANY DENOMINATIONS THAT ARE OUT
[47:33] THERE DON'T UNDERSTAND THE BOOK OF
[47:35] REVELATION, BUT GOD CAME TO US, PREACHED
[47:38] ON IT, OPENED IT UP, SHOWED US WHERE WE
[47:40] ARE, TOLD US TO COME OUT. HE PLACED US
[47:42] BACK IN CHAPTER 15. WOO!
[47:46] &gt;&gt; SHOWED US EXACTLY WHO WE ARE.
[47:49] &gt;&gt; WE DON'T HAVE TO BE AFRAID OF THE WHITE
[47:50] HORSE RIDER. WE HAVE AUTHORITY OVER HIM.
[47:53] WE DON'T HAVE TO BE AFRAID OF THE SECOND
[47:55] OR THE THIRD OR THE FOURTH. WE DON'T
[47:57] HAVE TO BE AFRAID OF THE PALE HORSE. WE
[47:59] HAVE AUTHORITY. WE DON'T HAVE TO BE
[48:01] AFRAID OF THE MARK OF THE BEAST.
[48:04] &gt;&gt; CUZ WE HAVE AUTHORITY
[48:06] &gt;&gt; AS SONS AND DAUGHTERS.
[48:11] &gt;&gt; Do you know who you are?
[48:15] &gt;&gt; WHO ARE YOU TONIGHT?
[48:19] &gt;&gt; Who are you tonight?
[48:25] tonight. You can't use the term I'm a
[48:28] message believer.
[48:34] &gt;&gt; That's just good talk.
[48:36] &gt;&gt; It has to be a revelation.
[48:39] &gt;&gt; Listen.
[48:41] &gt;&gt; He says, "Now you can know why it says
[48:44] that anyone who reads or even hears it
[48:47] is blessed.
[48:49] It is the REVELATION OF GOD THAT WILL
[48:54] GIVE YOU AUTHORITY OVER THE DEVIL.
[48:56] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[48:59] &gt;&gt; YOU SEE HOW SIMPLE THAT IS?
[49:01] &gt;&gt; IT'S THE REVELATION OF JESUS CHRIST. THE
[49:04] SAME THING HE TOLD PETER. HALLELUJAH.
[49:07] &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT.
[49:08] &gt;&gt; IT'S THE REVELATION OF JESUS CHRIST THAT
[49:10] GIVES US AUTHORITY OVER THE DEVIL
[49:12] TONIGHT.
[49:13] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[49:14] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[49:14] &gt;&gt; COME ON.
[49:15] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[49:15] &gt;&gt; HE SAYS, "FLESH AND BLOOD HAVE NOT
[49:17] REVEALED IT UNTO YOU. IT WAS A
[49:19] REVELATION.
[49:22] &gt;&gt; And when YOU KNOW WHO GOD IS, IT SHOULD
[49:24] BE ENOUGH TO DEFEAT THE DEVIL ANYTIME,
[49:28] ANY PLACE, ANYWHERE.
[49:30] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[49:32] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[49:35] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[49:37] Listen,
[49:40] I love this right here
[49:43] &gt;&gt; because God gave the prophet
[49:46] such an understanding when it came to
[49:48] the scripture.
[49:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:51] &gt;&gt; Things we would have never caught a hold
[49:52] of.
[49:53] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[49:54] &gt;&gt; Without hearing the voice.
[49:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[49:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[50:00] He says
[50:02] WE DON'T HAVE POWER.
[50:06] WE'RE not have power.
[50:08] We got authority.
[50:10] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[50:11] &gt;&gt; IT'S NOT A POWER. IT'S AUTHORITY.
[50:14] HALLELUJAH.
[50:15] &gt;&gt; MY WE DON'T NEED POWER.
[50:18] &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT.
[50:21] &gt;&gt; Somebody say, "AMEN."
[50:23] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. WE DON'T NEED POWER. WHY?
[50:26] CUZ WE GOT AUTHORITY.
[50:29] JESUS ALREADY DEMONSTRATED ALL THE POWER
[50:32] THAT THE BELIEVER WOULD EVER NEED.
[50:34] &gt;&gt; AND IF YOU TRUST IN HIM, YOU DON'T NEED
[50:37] POWER. YOU JUST NEED A FAITH.
[50:39] HALLELUJAH. IN THE AUTHORITY OF KNOWING
[50:42] WHO HE IS,
[50:45] &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHY THE BIBLE CAME, BROTHER
[50:47] AARON, AND IT SAID, HALLELUJAH. NOT BY
[50:49] POWER NOR BY MIGHT,
[50:52] &gt;&gt; BUT BY MY SPIRIT, SAY THE LORD. YES.
[50:56] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[50:59] &gt;&gt; But you know what the enemy does?
[51:02] The enemy bluffs some of us.
[51:04] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[51:05] &gt;&gt; We got law enforcement in here.
[51:07] Hallelujah. And you know, they had to go
[51:09] through some special training.
[51:12] &gt;&gt; They had to take time away from their
[51:13] family. Hallelujah. They had to learn
[51:16] the laws of the land
[51:18] &gt;&gt; so they could operate by those laws. And
[51:21] once they completed all the schooling
[51:23] and everything, what happened? They got
[51:25] a badge.
[51:30] &gt;&gt; THEY GOT A BADGE. WHEREVER THEY GO IN
[51:33] THEIR COUNTY OR IN THEIR STATE,
[51:34] HALLELUJAH, THEY DON'T HAVE TO SAY A
[51:36] WORD. ALL THEY HAVE TO DO IS FLASH THE
[51:38] BADGE.
[51:40] &gt;&gt; THE BADGE SHOWS, HALLELUJAH, THAT
[51:42] THERE'S AN ORGANIZATION BIGGER THAN JUST
[51:44] ONE PERSON STANDING BEHIND THIS PERSON,
[51:47] &gt;&gt; CHURCH. AND ONCE YOU GET THE BADGE OF
[51:49] THE HOLY GHOST, THERE'S SOMETHING BIGGER
[51:52] THAN YOU IN THE ROOM.
[51:54] &gt;&gt; There's something BIGGER THAN YOU IN
[51:55] YOUR FIRE. THERE'S SOMETHING BIGGER THAN
[51:57] YOU IN YOUR TRIAL OR YOUR STORM.
[52:00] &gt;&gt; THE PROPHET OF GOD SAID, "ALL OF HEAVEN
[52:02] IS BACK IN YOU."
[52:04] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[52:05] &gt;&gt; SIR,
[52:10] &gt;&gt; what if you was in the police car and
[52:11] had no authorization?
[52:15] That mean I didn't have to pull over. I
[52:18] can even talk junk TO YOU. GET OUT THAT
[52:21] CAR, YOU FAKE COP.
[52:24] But me, I'm a little bit more
[52:25] aggressive. I'll be like, "YOU AIN'T
[52:27] NOTHING BUT OLD PIG.
[52:38] Get on out of here." And I might spin
[52:41] off.
[52:43] Why? cuz he has no authority to do
[52:45] anything.
[52:46] &gt;&gt; He's bluffing.
[52:48] &gt;&gt; And what the enemy does, hallelujah, HE
[52:50] STUDIES YOU. HE WATCHES YOU. And he
[52:52] knows the areas you're afraid of.
[52:56] &gt;&gt; AND GOD, HE'LL ASK GOD, "Can I get in
[52:58] that area?" Hallelujah. Just to see if
[53:01] you'll stop serving him. So God will
[53:03] say, "Okay, go ahead." THE ONLY REASON
[53:05] WHY GOD LETS HIM GO SO GOD CAN SHOW YOU
[53:08] WHO YOU ARE.
[53:10] AMEN.
[53:12] &gt;&gt; BY THE TIME GOD WAS DONE WITH JOB, JOB
[53:15] WAS SAYING, "HALLELUJAH. I KNOW MY
[53:17] REDEEMER LIVING."
[53:19] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. AND I'M GOING TO SEE HIM
[53:20] AGAIN IN HIS FLESH.
[53:23] &gt;&gt; THAT TRIAL BOUGHT HIM INTO A CLOSER
[53:26] RECOGNITION OF THE AUTHORITY HE HAD.
[53:31] &gt;&gt; YOUR TRIALS ARE NOT THAT YOU MAY FALL
[53:33] BACKWARDS OR BE DEFEATED. YOUR TRIALS
[53:35] ARE THERE TO GIVE YOU A VICTORY.
[53:39] &gt;&gt; That's good.
[53:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:41] so you can RISE UP IN AUTHORITY. GOD
[53:43] TOLD ABRAHAM, "GO KILL YOUR SON." AFTER
[53:46] ALL HE DID, ALL GOD WAS TRYING TO DO WAS
[53:49] SHOW HIM, "I GAVE IT ALL TO YOU NOW."
[53:53] &gt;&gt; Then Abraham in THE MIDST OF THAT TRIAL,
[53:55] HALLELUJAH, I'VE BEEN LISTENING TO WHY
[53:57] CRY SPEAK. ABRAHAM IN THE MIDST OF THAT
[53:59] TRIAL, HE WOKE UP THAT MORNING UNDER THE
[54:02] COMMISSION OF WHAT GOD SAID, BUT SOME
[54:04] KIND OF WAY HE REALIZED WHO HE WAS.
[54:06] AMEN.
[54:07] &gt;&gt; AND BEFORE HE LEFT, BEFORE HE TOLD SARAH
[54:10] ANYTHING, HE SAID, "HEY, I AND the lad
[54:12] going to go and worship."
[54:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:16] &gt;&gt; WE GOING TO GO AND WORSHIP AND WE GOING
[54:19] TO RETURN. WHAT IS THAT? THAT SOUNDS
[54:21] LIKE A MAN OF AUTHORITY.
[54:26] &gt;&gt; God didn't say nothing about you coming
[54:28] to return.
[54:32] When you know who you are,
[54:35] &gt;&gt; you speak as God would speak.
[54:38] &gt;&gt; Isn't that what Abraham did?
[54:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Where did it COME FROM?
[54:42] ISN'T THAT what what Adam did?
[54:45] Hallelujah. Adam in the Garden OF EDEN,
[54:48] HE SPOKE AS GOD WOULD speak
[54:51] &gt;&gt; with the same authority. He knew who he
[54:54] was. And you want to know who ELSE KNEW
[54:55] WHO HE WAS? THE SERPENT.
[54:59] &gt;&gt; THE SERPENT KNEW WHO HE WAS. AMEN.
[55:01] &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHY THE SERPENT DIDN'T HAVE
[55:02] CONVERSATION WITH ADAM BECAUSE HE KNEW
[55:04] WHO Adam was.
[55:06] &gt;&gt; I WANT TO KNOW TONIGHT WHAT'S BEHIND
[55:08] THAT FLESH THAT'S SITTING IN THESE
[55:10] &gt;&gt; PEWS.
[55:13] &gt;&gt; IS IT THAT SAME SPIRIT THAT WAS
[55:15] HALLELUJAH JESUS CHRIST?
[55:20] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[55:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[55:24] &gt;&gt; Oh my. Listen. He said Christ has the
[55:27] power but we've got the authority. Amen.
[55:30] Amen.
[55:31] &gt;&gt; THERE'S A LOT OF DIFFERENCE. He was the
[55:34] one who conquered. HE CONQUERED AND GAVE
[55:37] US the authority.
[55:41] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[55:41] &gt;&gt; So, you see who WE SHOULD BE PUTTING OUR
[55:43] FAITH IN.
[55:44] &gt;&gt; YOU SHOULD PUT YOUR FAITH IN CHRIST CUZ
[55:47] HE HAS THE POWER, BUT HE GAVE YOU THE
[55:49] AUTHORITY TO BELIEVE IN HIM.
[55:52] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[55:53] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[55:54] &gt;&gt; Somebody say, "I believe."
[55:56] &gt;&gt; I believe.
[55:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Listen.
[56:01] &gt;&gt; He conquered and gave us the authority.
[56:04] He's got the power. But we got the
[56:06] authority.
[56:08] &gt;&gt; JUST LIKE AN AMBASSADOR GOING TO ANOTHER
[56:10] COUNTRY.
[56:12] &gt;&gt; WELL, that ambassador. Hallelujah. If I
[56:15] was an ambassador,
[56:18] I ain't going to say America.
[56:23] AS AN AMBASSADOR OF HEAVEN. If I was
[56:26] able to go down into hell, I'D HAVE ALL
[56:29] HEAVEN REPRESENTING ME.
[56:31] &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHAT CHRIST DID. HALLELUJAH.
[56:34] &gt;&gt; WHEN HE WENT DOWN INTO HELL, HE HAD ALL
[56:36] HEAVEN BACKING HIM. HALLELUJAH, CHURCH.
[56:39] THE SAME POWER AND AUTHORITY HE HAD ON
[56:41] EARTH, HE HAD IT DOWN IN THE REGIONS OF
[56:44] HELL.
[56:45] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[56:49] &gt;&gt; CAME DOWN TO SATAN'S HOUSE.
[56:52] &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. TOOK HIS HOUSE KEYS,
[56:54] &gt;&gt; TOLD HIM TO SHUT UP AND GET BACK IN THE
[56:56] OTHER ROOM.
[56:59] &gt;&gt; That's a man with authority.
[57:03] &gt;&gt; Well, no demon would even challenge him.
[57:06] &gt;&gt; No spirit, NO IMP. WHY? THEY knew who he
[57:10] was.
[57:12] &gt;&gt; He was in their element AND THEN IT
[57:14] BECAME HIS ELEMENT.
[57:17] &gt;&gt; IT SAY HALLELUJAH. ALL POWER IN HEAVEN,
[57:21] HELL, AND THE GRAVE
[57:24] &gt;&gt; WAS GIVEN UNTO HIM.
[57:25] &gt;&gt; SO I'M SAYING TO YOU TONIGHT, WHEN YOU
[57:27] GET THE REVELATION, HALLELUJAH, YOU GOT
[57:30] AUTHORITY OVER THE GRAVE.
[57:32] &gt;&gt; When you GET THE REVELATION, YOU GOT
[57:34] AUTHORITY OVER YOUR HELL.
[57:37] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[57:40] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[57:45] &gt;&gt; Right now, some of our battles, we feel
[57:46] like we in hell.
[57:48] But I'm here to tell you, you got
[57:51] authority over it.
[57:54] &gt;&gt; As an ambassador
[57:56] of Jesus Christ,
[57:58] &gt;&gt; oh my. Listen. He says, "And when a man
[58:01] or a woman is dressed in the full armor
[58:05] of God, it ain't power, it's authority
[58:09] from the high." When he says, "Devils
[58:13] will stream and break." Hallelujah.
[58:16] HE'S COMPARING THAT TO THE POLICE
[58:19] OFFICER STANDING OUT THERE IN THE MIDDLE
[58:21] OF TRAFFIC.
[58:22] &gt;&gt; Police officer BECAUSE OF HIS HIS HIS
[58:25] AUTHORITY. HALLELUJAH. TRAFFIC CAN BE
[58:27] REAL THICK. EVERYBODY MOVING FAST. IT
[58:30] COULD BE SOME DUMP TRUCKS AND TRACTOR
[58:31] TRAILERS, BUT HE CAN STAND OUT THERE IN
[58:34] FRONT OF IT ALL, HOLD UP THAT ONE HAND,
[58:36] AND EVERYBODY WILL COME TO A HALT.
[58:40] &gt;&gt; AMEN. AND THEN THE PROPHET COMES AND
[58:42] SAYS, "SO IS IT WITH THE SON AND
[58:45] DAUGHTER OF GOD
[58:47] &gt;&gt; WHEN YOU KNOW who you are
[58:49] &gt;&gt; AND WHO YOU REPRESENT AND WHAT'S BACKING
[58:51] YOU." HE SAID, "THE DEVIL WILL SCREAM."
[58:54] HALLELUJAH. AND SQUEAK his brakes.
[59:01] &gt;&gt; Oh my. You don't believe that?
[59:04] &gt;&gt; I give you a prime example. Remember
[59:08] there's a man in the Bible named Legion.
[59:11] &gt;&gt; He was in the tombs cutting himself,
[59:14] tormenting people as they walked by the
[59:15] grave site. But one day Jesus say, "I'm
[59:19] going to the grave site."
[59:21] &gt;&gt; Jesus come by the grave site and all
[59:23] legion of far off. All he saw was a body
[59:25] of flesh.
[59:27] &gt;&gt; Something that he was used to
[59:28] tormenting.
[59:29] &gt;&gt; CHURCH AND HE RAN OUT THERE.
[59:32] &gt;&gt; And as he got closer, he could feel
[59:34] something.
[59:36] HE CAN FEEL, HALLELUJAH, THOSE 12
[59:39] LEGIONS OF DEMONS, THEY COULD FEEL THE
[59:42] MASTER'S PRESENCE AND THEY START TO COME
[59:44] UNDER OBEDIENCE.
[59:47] &gt;&gt; AND THE BIBLE SAYS THEY RAN OUT THERE TO
[59:49] JESUS AND THEY WORSHIP.
[59:56] &gt;&gt; WELL, YOU KNOW WHO YOU ARE. SATAN WILL
[59:59] BOW DOWN BEFORE YOU.
[1:00:03] You say, "Bro Digs, you boy, you boy,
[1:00:06] you you you you pretty bold."
[1:00:09] &gt;&gt; CHURCH,
[1:00:10] &gt;&gt; "I AIN'T GOT THE POWER." HE DOES.
[1:00:13] &gt;&gt; I got authority
[1:00:16] &gt;&gt; to believe that he can do it.
[1:00:18] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:00:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:00:21] Hallelujah.
[1:00:23] &gt;&gt; You know, this this year, I have a theme
[1:00:26] for myself every year. A theme for
[1:00:28] myself.
[1:00:30] And my theme this year is I won't go
[1:00:32] back.
[1:00:34] Amen.
[1:00:35] &gt;&gt; I won't go back. Hallelujah. I'm at the
[1:00:39] point of no return.
[1:00:42] &gt;&gt; No matter how sticky it gets, no matter
[1:00:44] how strenuous the battle is, I'VE SEEN
[1:00:47] TOO MUCH GOD TO TURN AROUND.
[1:00:50] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:00:51] &gt;&gt; I'VE HAD TOO MANY VICTORIES TO GIVE UP.
[1:00:55] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[1:00:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:00:57] &gt;&gt; Last time I was here, Brother Tony was
[1:00:59] singing a song. Uh, you made a way.
[1:01:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:01:05] &gt;&gt; When my back was against the wall
[1:01:07] &gt;&gt; and it looked like it was over, you
[1:01:11] &gt;&gt; made a way.
[1:01:13] &gt;&gt; You know where that song came from?
[1:01:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. THAT MAN GOT VICTORIES.
[1:01:19] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. At the age of three, he fell
[1:01:22] off the balcony. Hallelujah. I think it
[1:01:25] WAS THREE STORIES DOWN. HALLELUJAH.
[1:01:28] WALKED AWAY FROM IT.
[1:01:31] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. SAY BY THE TIME HIS MAMA GOT
[1:01:33] TO HIM, HE WAS LIFELESS. AND SHE SAID,
[1:01:37] "OH JESUS."
[1:01:40] &gt;&gt; They said, "He didn't move." SHE SAID,
[1:01:42] "OH JESUS, HE DIDN'T MOVE." BUT THE
[1:01:45] THIRD TIME SHE CALLED JESUS, HE ROSE.
[1:01:48] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. WELL, WHAT WAS SHE DOING?
[1:01:51] SHE WAS EXERCISING HER AUTHORITY OVER
[1:01:54] DEATH. AMEN.
[1:01:56] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:01:57] &gt;&gt; And she ain't even got the full
[1:01:59] revelation like you got.
[1:02:02] &gt;&gt; SAME OLD US FOR NOT BELIEVING GOD.
[1:02:09] &gt;&gt; But that was just a piece of it. His
[1:02:11] wife got their first child. I think his
[1:02:14] name is Jace. Hallelujah. She she was
[1:02:17] pregnant and 21 weeks her water broke.
[1:02:21] Her water broke. And when they went to
[1:02:25] the doctor, ALL THE DOCTOR KNOW IS
[1:02:27] SCIENCE.
[1:02:29] &gt;&gt; But I'm going to give you the quote
[1:02:30] again.
[1:02:32] Wisdom versus faith.
[1:02:38] &gt;&gt; WISDOM VERSUS FAITH.
[1:02:40] &gt;&gt; I DON'T WANT YOUR WISDOM TONIGHT.
[1:02:43] &gt;&gt; GIVE ME YOUR FAITH.
[1:02:45] &gt;&gt; GIVE ME YOUR FAITH.
[1:02:47] &gt;&gt; AND TOGETHER WE'LL TAKE AUTHORITY OVER
[1:02:49] YOUR PROBLEMS.
[1:02:52] CHURCH. WISDOM VERSUS FAITH. HE SAID,
[1:02:55] "THEN JESUS DEFEATED THE DEVIL BY
[1:02:58] KNOWING WHO HE WAS."
[1:03:01] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:03:02] &gt;&gt; Church
[1:03:05] doctor said, "Well, 21 weeks, uh,
[1:03:10] y'all can try again. The baby ain't
[1:03:13] going to make it."
[1:03:17] 21 weeks, baby, you know, it's just too
[1:03:19] small. ain't going to make it. He said
[1:03:22] him and his wife looked at each other
[1:03:26] after the doctor left out the room and
[1:03:29] they looked at each other and they said,
[1:03:32] "We trust God too much to give up now."
[1:03:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:03:40] &gt;&gt; We trust God
[1:03:42] &gt;&gt; TOO MUCH TO GIVE UP NOW.
[1:03:44] &gt;&gt; I WISH I COULD GET AN AMEN IN HERE. WE
[1:03:47] TRUST GOD TOO MUCH TO GIVE UP. NOW,
[1:03:50] &gt;&gt; THIS AIN'T A TIME TO GIVE UP. THIS IS A
[1:03:53] TIME TO LOOK AT YOUR PROBLEM AND SAY, "I
[1:03:55] TAKE AUTHORITY OVER YOU IN THE NAME OF
[1:03:58] JESUS CHRIST. AS A SON, AS A DAUGHTER OF
[1:04:01] GOD, I KNOW WHO I AM."
[1:04:04] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:04:06] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:04:07] It's amazing to me, brother Jason.
[1:04:10] &gt;&gt; When you go through trials,
[1:04:12] &gt;&gt; holy, especially when it's worldwide,
[1:04:14] when everybody know about your trial,
[1:04:16] &gt;&gt; they look at you and they expect for you
[1:04:18] to be down.
[1:04:20] &gt;&gt; And then when they see you, take a look
[1:04:22] at me. I'm a wonder, see his glory. I
[1:04:27] know who I am.
[1:04:29] &gt;&gt; They looking at you like,
[1:04:31] &gt;&gt; is he supposed to BE DOING THAT? YES, I
[1:04:33] AM. AMEN.
[1:04:36] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:04:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:04:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:38] &gt;&gt; Some of y'all y'all need to Hallelujah.
[1:04:41] Don't let the devil ride.
[1:04:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:47] &gt;&gt; Don't do it. Don't do it. Don't do it.
[1:04:50] Don't let them ride. DON'T LET THEM
[1:04:51] RIDE. DON'T DO IT. DON'T do it.
[1:04:55] &gt;&gt; Brother Aaron want to sing that song
[1:04:57] bad.
[1:05:01] Hallelujah. Cuz if you let him ride,
[1:05:04] he'll want to drive your car.
[1:05:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:11] &gt;&gt; And if you let him drive, he'll take you
[1:05:14] too far.
[1:05:17] &gt;&gt; Don't do it. Don't do it. Don't do it.
[1:05:20] &gt;&gt; Don't do it. Don't do it.
[1:05:27] &gt;&gt; Some of y'all see them hitchhiking and
[1:05:28] y'all slowing down.
[1:05:34] I'm strong enough.
[1:05:39] &gt;&gt; See, I'm beyond that.
[1:05:41] &gt;&gt; If I see him hitchhiking,
[1:05:43] &gt;&gt; I hit him.
[1:05:46] I ain't worried about the D. I get that
[1:05:48] fixed.
[1:05:49] &gt;&gt; I get that feeling. If I got to get a
[1:05:51] new car, I GET A NEW CAR. HALLELUJAH.
[1:05:53] But I don't want to see HIM ON MY ROUTE.
[1:05:56] &gt;&gt; I DON'T WANT TO SEE HIM ON MY ROUTE
[1:05:58] ASKING FOR FAVORS. I DON'T WANT TO SEE
[1:06:00] HIM ON MY RAP TALKING ABOUT CAN I GO
[1:06:02] WHERE YOU GOING? NO YOU CANNOT.
[1:06:04] &gt;&gt; SOME OF Y'ALL NEED TO TELL THE DEVIL NO
[1:06:06] YOU CANNOT. YOU CANNOT FOLLOW ME. YOU
[1:06:09] CANNOT HITCHHIKE. I DON'T EVEN WANT TO
[1:06:11] SEE YOU RUN HIM IN THE DITCH.
[1:06:20] &gt;&gt; Somebody say don't do it now.
[1:06:25] &gt;&gt; Y'all y'all going to be in trouble.
[1:06:30] Oh my. Oh my church. Listen, I ain't
[1:06:33] going to be too much longer. I'm about
[1:06:34] to close.
[1:06:36] Let's go. Let's go to Matthew chapter
[1:06:39] 10.
[1:06:43] I hope
[1:06:46] like the prophet said, remember there's
[1:06:48] a story of a little girl who was
[1:06:50] paralyzed
[1:06:52] &gt;&gt; and she came in a prayer line with a
[1:06:53] shoe box.
[1:06:56] I HOPE YOU BROUGHT YOUR SHOE BOX
[1:06:58] TONIGHT.
[1:06:59] &gt;&gt; I HOPE THAT TEXT MADE YOU BRING SOME
[1:07:02] EXPECTATION TO CHURCH.
[1:07:05] &gt;&gt; That little GIRL KNEW THAT THE PROPHET
[1:07:07] HAD A MINISTRY. HALLELUJAH. TO GET IN
[1:07:09] CONTACT WITH GOD AND SHE CAME TO CHURCH
[1:07:12] WITH A SHOE BOX.
[1:07:15] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. AND THE PROPHET SAID,
[1:07:16] "HONEY, WHAT'S THAT UNDER YOUR ARM?" SHE
[1:07:18] SAID, "A PAIR OF SHOES CUZ AFTER YOU
[1:07:21] PRAY FOR ME, I'MMA PUT THEM ON AND WALK.
[1:07:24] HALLELUJAH.
[1:07:25] &gt;&gt; WHAT IS THAT? THAT'S EXERCISING HER
[1:07:27] AUTHORITY
[1:07:29] &gt;&gt; BEFORE she even got prayed for.
[1:07:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:07:35] &gt;&gt; Oh my. The prophet said, "Okay, honey, I
[1:07:39] want you to go sit over here
[1:07:41] &gt;&gt; and let your faith build up."
[1:07:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. See, some of you are
[1:07:46] fighting some things you've been
[1:07:48] fighting for years. Come on.
[1:07:50] &gt;&gt; But you've been coming here and the
[1:07:52] ministry's been preaching.
[1:07:54] &gt;&gt; Whether it be the pastor or brother
[1:07:56] Caleb or brother Matt or or brother
[1:07:58] Matt. Hallelujah. Any one of those
[1:08:00] brothers preaching, I hope I left nobody
[1:08:02] out, but any of those brothers
[1:08:04] preaching, what is it? It was to build
[1:08:06] up your faith
[1:08:08] &gt;&gt; to get you to that place WHERE YOU COULD
[1:08:11] ADDRESS IT, BELIEVE, AND WALK AWAY WITH
[1:08:14] THE VICTORY.
[1:08:16] AMEN.
[1:08:17] &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHAT THE MESSAGE HAS BEEN DOING.
[1:08:20] THE MESSAGE HAS BEEN BUILDING YOUR FAITH
[1:08:24] &gt;&gt; FOR WHAT? A BODY CHANGE.
[1:08:28] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:08:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:08:33] church. The inspiration for I won't go
[1:08:36] back is you see people turning around
[1:08:41] &gt;&gt; been in this truth for years
[1:08:43] &gt;&gt; and they turning around.
[1:08:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:45] &gt;&gt; But the Bible says as a dog goes back to
[1:08:47] his vomit.
[1:08:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And I love how the prophet
[1:08:50] said, he said, "Think about it. They
[1:08:52] going back to THEIR VOMIT. IF IT'S
[1:08:54] VOMIT, IT'S SOMETHING THEY THREW UP.
[1:08:57] &gt;&gt; That means it was SOMETHING THAT ALREADY
[1:08:59] MADE THEM SICK.
[1:09:03] And they go back to it. That mean they
[1:09:05] GOING TO GET SICK ALL OVER.
[1:09:10] &gt;&gt; I will not go back.
[1:09:13] &gt;&gt; What I say in Matthew Matthew 10.
[1:09:19] &gt;&gt; Oh my
[1:09:25] verse one.
[1:09:32] Are you with me? Yes, sir.
[1:09:34] &gt;&gt; And when he had called unto his 12
[1:09:38] disciples,
[1:09:39] he gave them power
[1:09:43] &gt;&gt; against unclean spirits to cast them out
[1:09:47] and to heal all manner of sickness
[1:09:50] &gt;&gt; and all manner of disease. Now, my
[1:09:53] question to you is, does that have an
[1:09:56] expiration date?
[1:09:59] So that mean what he gave to the
[1:10:00] disciples back then. I don't know ABOUT
[1:10:03] YOU, BUT I'M A DISCIPLE.
[1:10:06] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:10:07] &gt;&gt; SO THAT MEANS THE SAME POWER PETER,
[1:10:09] JAMES, AND JOHN HAVE, BROTHER DIGGS GOT
[1:10:12] TONIGHT.
[1:10:13] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. SISTER SMITH GOT TONIGHT.
[1:10:16] HALLELUJAH.
[1:10:17] &gt;&gt; THERE'S NO EXPIRATION DATE ON AUTHORITY.
[1:10:31] Somebody saying just in time,
[1:10:36] &gt;&gt; church.
[1:10:38] He gave them power. Hallelujah. What did
[1:10:41] he give them power over? Now you put
[1:10:44] your problem in this.
[1:10:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He gave the 12. Hallelujah.
[1:10:48] He say 12.
[1:10:51] &gt;&gt; JUDAS WAS IN THERE.
[1:10:55] THE DEVIL WAS OPERATING UNDER A CERTAIN
[1:10:57] AUTHORITY.
[1:11:00] &gt;&gt; HE GAVE THE DEVIL AUTHORITY.
[1:11:04] &gt;&gt; NOT JUST ONE TIME WHEN THE DEMONS CAME
[1:11:07] TO JESUS. HALLELUJAH. HE SAID, "MASTER,
[1:11:09] WILL YOU ALLOW US TO GO INTO THE PIGS?"
[1:11:12] HE SAID, "GO AHEAD." OH MY. IF GOD WILL
[1:11:15] GRANT THE DEVIL'S WISH,
[1:11:19] &gt;&gt; WHAT ABOUT YOU?
[1:11:21] THE DEVIL KNEW WHO HE WAS. HE KNEW THAT
[1:11:24] GOD COULD GRANT HIS WISH. WHAT ABOUT
[1:11:26] YOU? IF HE GRANT THE WISH OF DEMONS,
[1:11:30] &gt;&gt; WHAT ABOUT US AS SONS AND DAUGHTERS OF
[1:11:32] GOD?
[1:11:33] &gt;&gt; YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO ASK THAT YOUR JOYS
[1:11:36] MAY BE FULL.
[1:11:38] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:11:43] &gt;&gt; He says he had called to him 12
[1:11:46] disciples. He gave them power against
[1:11:49] unclean spirits
[1:11:51] &gt;&gt; to cast out. Hallelujah. AND TO HEAL ALL
[1:11:56] MANNER
[1:11:57] &gt;&gt; of sickness.
[1:11:59] &gt;&gt; All manner
[1:12:02] &gt;&gt; if it's in this church tonight.
[1:12:07] Let me tell you, let me say it like
[1:12:08] this. If it's in this church, if a
[1:12:11] sickness is in this church tonight, I
[1:12:14] got authority over it.
[1:12:18] And if you'll give me consent, I'll deal
[1:12:21] with that demon.
[1:12:24] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:12:24] &gt;&gt; But I don't want your faith to rely on
[1:12:26] me.
[1:12:28] &gt;&gt; The same faith THAT GOD GAVE ME, HE GAVE
[1:12:30] UNTO YOU. HE GAVE IT TO THE 12. AND HE
[1:12:32] SAID, "ONE OF YOU IS THE DEVIL."
[1:12:36] &gt;&gt; You don't have to wait for a preacher to
[1:12:37] lay hands on you,
[1:12:39] &gt;&gt; but we're here to assist.
[1:12:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:12:44] Listen.
[1:12:48] All manner of sickness, all manner of
[1:12:50] diseases. What does all mean?
[1:12:53] &gt;&gt; There you go.
[1:12:55] &gt;&gt; All means all.
[1:12:57] &gt;&gt; THANK YOU, BROTHER BRAD. EVERYTHING.
[1:13:00] YOUR SITUATION.
[1:13:01] &gt;&gt; THOSE OF YOU WHO ARE STREAMING TONIGHT,
[1:13:03] YOUR SITUATION.
[1:13:05] &gt;&gt; ALL.
[1:13:06] &gt;&gt; DON'T SEND IN NO PRAYER REQUEST. TAKE
[1:13:09] AUTHORITY OVER IT RIGHT NOW.
[1:13:11] IN THE NAME OF JESUS, I TAKE AUTHORITY
[1:13:14] OVER IT RIGHT NOW.
[1:13:17] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:13:21] &gt;&gt; I was at a church one time and the
[1:13:24] customs was to pray after the after the
[1:13:27] me after the message. So they had all
[1:13:29] these notes they wrote down. They read
[1:13:31] all of them and they gave them to me.
[1:13:33] Say, "Brother, bear with us." I ain't
[1:13:36] reading none of them. I took all of
[1:13:37] them. I ripped them up.
[1:13:42] We already got the victory.
[1:13:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:46] &gt;&gt; Why are we asking God to do what he's
[1:13:48] already done?
[1:13:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:13:52] &gt;&gt; That's why I stand here tonight cancer
[1:13:55] free.
[1:13:56] &gt;&gt; Because I told the Lord, I said, "God,
[1:13:58] if you've already healed me, prove it to
[1:14:00] me.
[1:14:01] &gt;&gt; I'm going to STAND ON YOUR WORD. PROVE
[1:14:03] IT TO ME. IF THIS CANCER IN MY BODY,
[1:14:05] HALLELUJAH, HAS ALREADY BEEN DEFEATED.
[1:14:07] HALLELUJAH. I'M AT THE AGE OF 15.
[1:14:10] HALLELUJAH. NOT KNOWING GOD, I WAS JUST
[1:14:14] LIKE THESE MEN. Put that back up. 10.
[1:14:17] Hallelujah. Matthew chapter 10. I was
[1:14:20] just like these guys. HALLELUJAH.
[1:14:22] BROTHERS, WHAT DO YOU MEAN? EVERYBODY,
[1:14:26] ALL 12 RIGHT HERE IN THIS MOMENT DIDN'T
[1:14:29] HAVE THE HOLY GHOST, BUT THEY HAD a
[1:14:40] &gt;&gt; They didn't have the Holy Ghost.
[1:14:42] &gt;&gt; No.
[1:14:43] &gt;&gt; But Jesus gave him authority.
[1:14:45] &gt;&gt; Gave them power over all sickness and
[1:14:48] disease. Now, let me ask you a question.
[1:14:50] Did they exercise it? Yes, they did.
[1:14:54] &gt;&gt; YES, THEY DID.
[1:14:55] &gt;&gt; WITHOUT THE HOLY GHOST, JUST FAITH IN
[1:14:58] WHO THEY WAS FOLLOWING. WOW.
[1:15:01] &gt;&gt; FAITH IN CHRIST
[1:15:03] &gt;&gt; WAS ENOUGH. HALLELUJAH. TO HEAL THE
[1:15:05] SICK, RAISE THE DEAD, CAST OUT DEMONS.
[1:15:09] &gt;&gt; IT WAS ENOUGH.
[1:15:12] &gt;&gt; We have no excuse.
[1:15:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:16] &gt;&gt; I was just like them. Hallelujah.
[1:15:20] not realizing
[1:15:22] God honors faith.
[1:15:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:15:25] &gt;&gt; Faith is the revelation.
[1:15:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And when you realize who God
[1:15:31] is and you put him in place in your
[1:15:34] situation, he becomes the power and
[1:15:37] authority.
[1:15:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:49] There's a lot more I could say, but I'm
[1:15:51] I'm come down to a close. Listen now.
[1:15:57] I hope somebody is bubbling right now
[1:16:03] cuz I'm bubbling.
[1:16:06] But D, what do you mean? I can feel his
[1:16:09] presence.
[1:16:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:16:14] Being in this channel many many many
[1:16:16] times.
[1:16:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:18] &gt;&gt; I can feel when God is near
[1:16:20] &gt;&gt; and when the devil is afraid.
[1:16:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:25] &gt;&gt; All God wants you to do is recognize
[1:16:28] who you are.
[1:16:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:16:32] Oh my.
[1:16:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:16:37] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[1:16:40] Listen.
[1:16:42] He says, "Now I realize that I am in the
[1:16:45] pull pit and I realize that God is
[1:16:48] present."
[1:16:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:54] &gt;&gt; You got to go past this room and you got
[1:16:57] to tap into a place where God is.
[1:17:02] &gt;&gt; He's in this room, church.
[1:17:05] &gt;&gt; You say, "Really, does Brother Digs?"
[1:17:07] Yes, HE'S IN THIS ROOM BY promise
[1:17:11] &gt;&gt; and God cannot tell a lie.
[1:17:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:17:16] He said, "And I realize God is present,
[1:17:18] but it seems to me that something spoke
[1:17:22] DOWN IN MY SOUL AND SAID, "I'm waiting
[1:17:24] to see what you're going TO DO ABOUT
[1:17:26] IT." MY
[1:17:28] &gt;&gt; HOW MANY OF US BELIEVE GOD IS HERE?
[1:17:31] &gt;&gt; BUT IS THAT SPIRIT INSIDE OF YOU SAYING,
[1:17:33] "I'M WAITING TO SEE WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO
[1:17:35] DO ABOUT IT." ARE YOU GOING TO TAKE GOD
[1:17:37] AT HIS WORD OR ARE YOU GOING TO WALK
[1:17:39] BACK OUT OF HERE DEFEATED?
[1:17:44] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:17:45] &gt;&gt; The Bible don't The Bible don't even say
[1:17:47] we don't even have to pray. The Bible
[1:17:49] just says that they can lay hands on
[1:17:51] them
[1:17:52] &gt;&gt; in the name of Jesus right now.
[1:17:55] &gt;&gt; All we got to do is touch and agree
[1:17:58] &gt;&gt; and the enemy is defeated
[1:18:00] &gt;&gt; in every form, in every matter. He's
[1:18:03] defeated right now. I don't care how
[1:18:06] long it's been GOING ON. IT STOPS RIGHT
[1:18:08] NOW BECAUSE WE have authority over it.
[1:18:12] WE ARE SONS AND DAUGHTERS.
[1:18:14] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:18:16] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:18:18] &gt;&gt; We take authority over the enemy.
[1:18:26] &gt;&gt; Stop losing sleep
[1:18:29] over heaviness you're carrying.
[1:18:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:18:37] Stop letting the enemy look you in your
[1:18:38] face.
[1:18:40] Hallelujah. If Satan is looking you in
[1:18:43] your face, he's out of place.
[1:18:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:46] &gt;&gt; Scripturally,
[1:18:47] &gt;&gt; he's out of place. He don't belong in
[1:18:50] your face.
[1:18:51] &gt;&gt; He don't belong in your ears. The Bible
[1:18:53] says he belongs under my feet.
[1:18:57] &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHERE HE BELONG.
[1:18:59] &gt;&gt; AND I GOT ALL AUTHORITY TO STOMP ON THE
[1:19:02] DEVIL'S HEAD. HALLELUJAH.
[1:19:04] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR.
[1:19:06] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:19:07] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:19:09] Oh my. Listen.
[1:19:14] He says, "But it seems to me." Everybody
[1:19:17] all right?
[1:19:18] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:19:19] &gt;&gt; He says, "But it seems to me that
[1:19:21] something spoke down in my soul and
[1:19:22] said, I'm waiting to see what you're
[1:19:25] going to do about it. I gave my
[1:19:28] authority to the church.
[1:19:31] There you come back again to Hallelujah.
[1:19:35] Say to this mountain, I gave my
[1:19:38] authority to the church and I'm waiting
[1:19:41] to see what you're going to do.
[1:19:45] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:19:46] &gt;&gt; GOD WANTS TO SEE TONIGHT if you know who
[1:19:50] you are.
[1:19:54] &gt;&gt; He said, I wonder if that's his attitude
[1:19:57] towards us all. Hallelujah.
[1:20:00] all the time that he's WAITING TO SEE
[1:20:04] WHAT WE'RE going to do. What about the
[1:20:06] signs of the time we just we just been
[1:20:09] preaching about what
[1:20:12] what would he do? He's waiting to see
[1:20:15] what we'll do.
[1:20:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:18] &gt;&gt; Oh my I'm going just break I'mma break
[1:20:21] in this quote because I don't feel like
[1:20:22] reading all of it.
[1:20:24] But listen,
[1:20:28] we got time. Amen.
[1:20:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:31] &gt;&gt; I appreciate the five of you.
[1:20:35] &gt;&gt; Listen, he says, "Oh, if the great holy
[1:20:39] church only realize its power to do
[1:20:42] these things, but there's so much doubt
[1:20:45] and fear and trembling, wondering if it
[1:20:48] will, COULD IT HAPPEN?"
[1:20:51] &gt;&gt; BETHL TABERNACLE
[1:20:59] AS LONG AS THAT EXISTS, THE CHURCH CAN
[1:21:01] NEVER STAND UPRIGHT.
[1:21:04] &gt;&gt; And when every talk of FEAR IS VANISHED
[1:21:07] AND THE HOLY SPIRIT IS COMPLETELY in
[1:21:09] control of the church, THEN ALL FEARS
[1:21:12] ARE GONE. AND THE CHURCH HAS THE POWER,
[1:21:16] WHAT POWER? THE AUTHORITY
[1:21:19] &gt;&gt; TO POSSESS AND CLAIM WHAT BELONGS TO YOU
[1:21:22] TONIGHT.
[1:21:23] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:21:24] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. JANUARY 14TH, 2026.
[1:21:28] EXERCISE YOUR AUTHORITY, CHURCH.
[1:21:34] &gt;&gt; HE SAID THAT CHURCH HAS THE POWER. SEE
[1:21:36] WHY? THEY HAVE EVERYTHING THAT HEAVEN
[1:21:39] OWNS. HALLELUJAH. BEHIND THEM.
[1:21:43] &gt;&gt; Remember he TOLD PETER, HALLELUJAH,
[1:21:45] WHATSOEVER YOU BIND ON EARTH SHALL BE
[1:21:48] BOUND IN HEAVEN. WHATSOEVER YOU LOOSE ON
[1:21:50] EARTH SHALL BE LOOSED IN HEAVEN. WHAT
[1:21:52] DOES THAT? THE REVELATION.
[1:21:59] &gt;&gt; IT'S THE REVELATION THAT GIVES US
[1:22:01] AUTHORITY.
[1:22:02] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:22:03] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:22:06] &gt;&gt; Cuz in that moment, Peter didn't have
[1:22:09] the Holy Ghost.
[1:22:14] &gt;&gt; It was simply knowing who he was.
[1:22:19] &gt;&gt; He said, "They're ambassadors to the
[1:22:21] throne." Absolutely. An ambassador of
[1:22:22] Christ has authority and everything that
[1:22:25] Christ owns belong to that ambassador.
[1:22:27] Somebody say amen.
[1:22:29] &gt;&gt; And he said, "Go ye into all the world.
[1:22:32] Ye are my witnesses after the Holy Ghost
[1:22:34] is come on you." And what is a witness?
[1:22:37] It is an ambassador is to come and
[1:22:40] witness something. The whole power OF
[1:22:43] HEAVEN IS RIGHT in your hands. My
[1:22:47] then the prophet comes and says, "Oh my,
[1:22:50] THERE'S ENOUGH POWER IN THIS CHURCH TO
[1:22:52] CREATE A WORLD AND GO LIVE ON IT." WHAT
[1:22:55] KIND OF POWER? AUTHORITY.
[1:22:58] &gt;&gt; HE'S NOT TALKING ABOUT, "HALLELUJAH,
[1:22:59] JUST GOING TO CREATE ANOTHER EARTH." But
[1:23:01] he's TALKING ABOUT CREATE ANOTHER WORLD
[1:23:03] WITHIN YOUR SITUATION.
[1:23:06] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:23:16] This is the part I love. How many
[1:23:19] believe you're sitting under fruitful
[1:23:20] ministry?
[1:23:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:24] I'm not talking about brother Brandham.
[1:23:26] I'm talking about Bethl Tabernacle.
[1:23:28] &gt;&gt; How many believe you're sitting under
[1:23:29] fruitful ministry?
[1:23:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:23:33] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:23:34] He said the whole power of heaven is
[1:23:36] right behind is right in your hands. He
[1:23:39] says, "Oh, why do we sit and the church
[1:23:43] is barren and we set dormant? Is because
[1:23:47] that we don't recognize these things.
[1:23:50] &gt;&gt; If we believe we are under a fruitful
[1:23:53] ministry, we shouldn't be barren."
[1:23:58] &gt;&gt; Come musicians, come on. I'm closing.
[1:24:11] Who are you tonight?
[1:24:16] &gt;&gt; We going to spend time
[1:24:19] continuously calling out the enemy
[1:24:21] tonight. H.
[1:24:24] But I want to give you a little insight
[1:24:26] in deliverance.
[1:24:28] Hallelujah. I'm gonna give you a little
[1:24:30] insight in deliverance.
[1:24:33] Once you tell the enemy,
[1:24:36] you denounce him, you don't want to be
[1:24:39] bothered in this way anymore, he has to
[1:24:42] release.
[1:24:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Whatever the sickness,
[1:24:49] whatever the problem, once you speak to
[1:24:51] it, Hallelujah. And you say, in the name
[1:24:54] of Jesus, I don't want this in my body
[1:24:56] anymore. It has to let go. In the name
[1:24:59] of Jesus, it has to let go.
[1:25:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:03] Hallelujah.
[1:25:06] But the thing of it is the PROPHET OF
[1:25:08] GOD, HE said one of THE GREATEST THINGS,
[1:25:11] TWO things we HAVE IS A COMMITTAL AND A
[1:25:13] CONFESSION.
[1:25:15] &gt;&gt; AND ONCE YOU HALLELUJAH, CONFESS AND
[1:25:17] COMMIT IT TO GOD. SATAN IS POWERLESS.
[1:25:22] &gt;&gt; BUT YOU GOT TO WANT TO GET RID OF IT.
[1:25:25] YOU GOT TO WANT TO SAY ENOUGH IS ENOUGH.
[1:25:27] &gt;&gt; I'M TIRED OF STRUGGLING. I'M TIRED OF
[1:25:29] FIGHTING THE SAME BATTLE. TONIGHT. I
[1:25:32] WANT MY JOY BACK.
[1:25:34] &gt;&gt; GLORY. AMEN. Come on. Praise God.
[1:25:38] &gt;&gt; I want my joy back.
[1:25:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:25:42] &gt;&gt; I want my joy back.
[1:25:44] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:25:46] &gt;&gt; I've been serving the Lord a long time.
[1:25:48] I got a right to be happy about it.
[1:25:52] &gt;&gt; I got a right to come to church and
[1:25:54] rejoice in his goodness. No matter WHAT
[1:25:56] THE BATTLE MAY LOOK LIKE, TAKE AUTHORITY
[1:25:58] OVER IT RIGHT NOW IN THE NAME OF JESUS.
[1:26:01] AMEN.
[1:26:02] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:26:02] &gt;&gt; Take authority out of it.
[1:26:05] &gt;&gt; DON'T WALK ABOUT HERE SAYING, "OH, I
[1:26:07] SHOULD HAVE GOT PRAYED FOR." NO, YOU
[1:26:08] SHOULD HAVE SPOKE UP.
[1:26:12] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.
[1:26:13] &gt;&gt; YOU SHOULD HAVE SPOKE UP.
[1:26:15] &gt;&gt; GOD TOLD MOSES, "WHY YOU CRYING TO ME?
[1:26:17] SPEAK AND MOVE FORWARD."
[1:26:20] &gt;&gt; HE DIDN'T HAVE TIME TO PRAY FOR 2
[1:26:23] MILLION, 4 MILLION PEOPLE. HE SAID,
[1:26:24] "SPEAK AND MOVE FORWARD."
[1:26:26] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:26:35] We've been in church too long.
[1:26:38] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:26:39] &gt;&gt; Settling for defeat.
[1:26:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:43] &gt;&gt; It's time for us to exercise our
[1:26:45] authority.
[1:26:48] &gt;&gt; In this very moment,
[1:26:51] in this very time, young people, the
[1:26:54] things you are struggling with
[1:26:56] right now Amen.
[1:26:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:27:00] &gt;&gt; Whatever that struggle, that struggle
[1:27:01] may be lust,
[1:27:03] &gt;&gt; that struggle may be pornography.
[1:27:05] &gt;&gt; That struggle may be uh insecurities, it
[1:27:07] may be anxiety,
[1:27:09] &gt;&gt; I'm saying to you tonight,
[1:27:11] &gt;&gt; call it by name.
[1:27:14] &gt;&gt; And say, I rebuke you right now in the
[1:27:17] name of Jesus. Call it by name.
[1:27:21] Hallelujah.
[1:27:22] &gt;&gt; SEE, DELIVERANCE IS NOT JUST A COMING
[1:27:25] AND A FALLING DOWN TO THE ALTAR.
[1:27:27] DELIVERANCE IS IDENTIFYING YOUR ENEMY
[1:27:29] AND THEN TELLING HIM, "I DON'T WANT YOU
[1:27:32] IN MY LIFE ANYMORE."
[1:27:36] &gt;&gt; CHURCH, if you notice, when Jesus got
[1:27:38] the legion, he didn't just PRAY FOR HIM.
[1:27:41] HE ASKED HIM A QUESTION. WHAT IS YOUR
[1:27:43] NAME?
[1:27:45] &gt;&gt; IDENTIFY YOURSELF. IDENTIFY THAT SPIRIT.
[1:27:48] CALL IT OUT.
[1:27:52] &gt;&gt; CALL IT OUT. BE SPECIFIC. GOD IS
[1:27:55] INTENTIONAL. AMEN.
[1:28:03] &gt;&gt; You have authority over it.
[1:28:07] &gt;&gt; And they got to respond.
[1:28:10] Once you call it by name, it's
[1:28:12] identified.
[1:28:14] Hallelujah.
[1:28:15] Hallelujah. It can't sit that dormant
[1:28:17] anymore. Hallelujah. Brother Brad, I've
[1:28:20] seen it too many times in church where
[1:28:23] the anointing is moving. Spirits hide.
[1:28:26] &gt;&gt; They hide and they sit there because
[1:28:28] we're a calm church. We're a nice
[1:28:30] church. BUT I WANT TO SAY THIS,
[1:28:32] HALLELUJAH, ABRUPTLY AND BOLDLY. I SEE
[1:28:35] YOU, SATAN.
[1:28:41] &gt;&gt; I see you.
[1:28:44] Let go of your fears right now. Let it
[1:28:45] go. Let it go.
[1:28:48] Rejoice in him. Let it go. You know what
[1:28:51] you want God to do? CALL IT BY NAME.
[1:28:56] Identify it and say, "Get out of my
[1:28:58] body. GET OUT OF MY LIFE. GET OUT OF MY
[1:29:02] MIND.
[1:29:09] This is not that you may be afraid. No,
[1:29:15] we're exercising our authority for true
[1:29:18] deliverance.
[1:29:20] Hallelujah. While the Holy Spirit is
[1:29:21] moving. Hallelujah. By the grace of God,
[1:29:24] I can move to this room and touch
[1:29:25] different ones. Hallelujah. Who are
[1:29:27] going through. BUT I DON'T WANT TO DO
[1:29:29] THAT. I want you to want God to do it.
[1:29:33] NOT BROTHER DIGGS TO DO IT. I want YOU
[1:29:35] TO WANT GOD TO DO IT. BECAUSE WHEN I'M
[1:29:37] GONE, GOD WILL STILL BE HERE. HE'LL BE
[1:29:41] HERE NEXT WEEK AND THE WEEK AFTER THAT
[1:29:43] AND THE WEEK AFTER THAT. IF YOU COULD
[1:29:45] JUST TAP IN TO GOD, HE WILL DEAL WITH
[1:29:48] YOUR STRUGGLES TONIGHT.
[1:30:03] While you're waiting on the altar call,
[1:30:04] the altar's in your heart.
[1:30:08] Let God meet you right there in your
[1:30:09] seat. Hallelujah. Right there in your
[1:30:13] seat. Let him meet you right there in
[1:30:14] your seat. Hallelujah.
[1:30:17] Right there in your seat. Hallelujah.
[1:30:20] God has come to recover and restore.
[1:30:23] Hallelujah.
[1:30:26] &gt;&gt; In the name of Jesus. So let's go
[1:30:29] &gt;&gt; in the name of Jesus.
[1:30:31] &gt;&gt; For months, for weeks, for years,
[1:30:34] Satan's been STRIPPING YOU FROM YOUR
[1:30:36] JOY. GET YOUR JOY BACK.
[1:30:39] Fall back in love with the Lord.
[1:30:43] It belongs to you. It belongs to you.
[1:30:47] It belongs to you. Hallelujah.
[1:30:51] It belongs to you.
[1:30:54] Hallelujah. It's connecting. Just reach
[1:30:57] up and grab it right now in the name of
[1:30:59] Jesus. Hallelujah. In the name of Jesus.
[1:31:04] Hallelujah. We take authority over the
[1:31:06] enemy right now. Satan, you've been
[1:31:08] you've been troubled and you've been
[1:31:09] trying to make him doubt, but we bind
[1:31:12] your lies right now in the name of Jesus
[1:31:14] Christ.
[1:31:15] Hallelujah. And let the spirit of love
[1:31:20] overflow in this house
[1:31:22] against every trial, against every
[1:31:25] situation, against every struggle. Lord,
[1:31:28] let the love of God prevail
[1:31:32] through the authority as a son right now
[1:31:35] in Jesus Christ. And let it overflow.
[1:31:39] Let it overflow. Let it move from you to
[1:31:42] you
[1:31:43] &gt;&gt; down to the children. Hallelujah. Let
[1:31:45] the love of God overflow.
[1:31:48] WE TAKE AUTHORITY OVER THE TRIAL RIGHT
[1:31:51] NOW.
[1:31:52] &gt;&gt; And we speak deliverance
[1:31:56] in this house.
[1:31:59] &gt;&gt; We can praise him. YOU DON'T HAVE TO
[1:32:03] TELL ME. GOD ALREADY KNOWS. Glor
[1:32:11] King
[1:32:12] of glory.

[1:42:34] Brother Ken Boo says, "Please remember
[1:42:36] Caitlyn in prayer tonight. She's home
[1:42:38] not feeling well today. Also, my
[1:42:40] grandmother, Sister Gene, I'm having
[1:42:42] some tests run at my doctor's request.
[1:42:44] Please pray all goes well and a good
[1:42:47] report and that my back doesn't cause me
[1:42:49] a problem due to the nuclear test. Also,
[1:42:51] please pray for my neighbor Ruth. She
[1:42:53] left the hospital on Sunday evening with
[1:42:55] the flu. She's pretty sick right now.
[1:42:57] She'd been in the hospital since Friday
[1:42:59] for diverticulitis. She left the
[1:43:01] hospital with the flu. So, we want to
[1:43:03] remember my memo having the test run and
[1:43:06] that she gets a good report also for her
[1:43:08] neighbor Ruth. Sister Melissa says,
[1:43:10] "First of all, I'd like to praise God
[1:43:11] for what he's done in the life of my
[1:43:14] teacher friend with cancer. She's very
[1:43:16] troubled over this next round of chemo.
[1:43:18] The healthc care staff trying to prepare
[1:43:20] her has told her it's going to be awful,
[1:43:23] much worse than anything she has
[1:43:24] experienced. Thus for her side effects
[1:43:27] have been minimal thus far. Sorry, her
[1:43:30] side effects has been minimal and I
[1:43:32] believe an answer to our prayers. Please
[1:43:34] continue. I believe it was an answer to
[1:43:36] our prayers. Please continue to pray

[1:43:57] prayer request for my daughter Olivia.

[1:44:02] lupus like symptoms, but the test has
[1:44:04] been inconclusive. She's having joint
[1:44:06] pains in her knees and issues with her
[1:44:08] hair growth and breakage, asking God to
[1:44:10] completely restore her hair and take
[1:44:12] away all pains from her joints. And this
[1:44:15] diagnosis that Satan is trying to put
[1:44:17] upon her is reversed and that she does
[1:44:20] not have this disease. God is able.
