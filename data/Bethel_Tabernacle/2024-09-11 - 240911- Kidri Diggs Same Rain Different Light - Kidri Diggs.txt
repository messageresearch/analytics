Praise You In The Wonderful Name of Jesus Christ the church say amen amen hallelujah if you have your Bibles let's turn to uh Job chapter 14 Your Grace amazes me Hallelujah job believe I want chapter 14 Job 14 let's start reading at verse 7 you have say Amen the Bible says for there is hope of a tree if it be cut down that it will Sprout again and that the tender Branch thereof will not cease though the root thereof wax old in the earth and the stock thereof D in the ground yet through the scent of water my it hadn't even rain yet but there's something in a root there's something in a seed that at the scent of water it will bud and bring forth bows like a plant oh my but man dieth and waste away yay man giveth up The Ghost and where is he let's go to um Isaiah chapter 10 no let's go to Matthew Matthew 5 Matthew Chapter 5 then we're going to go to Isaiah chapter 10 Matthew 5 and 45 Matthew 5 and 45 the Bible says that ye may be children of your father Father which is in heaven for he maketh his son to rise upon the evil and on the good and sendeth reigned on the just and unjust amen let's go to uh Isaiah chapter 10 familiar verse of scriptures Isaiah 10 and and 27 Isaiah 10 and 27 the Bible says and it shall come to pass in that day that his burden shall be taken away from off thy shoulder and his yoke from off thy neck and the Yoke shall be destroyed because of the anointing amen may the Lord bless reading of his word you can have your seats amen by the grace of God tonight I want to use for a subject same rain different light same rain different light you know and and and I'm G kind of start uh on my end backwards you know but I hope you can follow along uh um same rain different light now we know the Bible always speaks in in in Shadows and in types and if I say rain you know we're not really talking about rain as in leadership or or as in Lord I'm talking about r n rain like a falling a a a dripping a soaking a thunder but I'm not talking about the rain as far as being wet but I'm talking about the rain of the anointing Hallelujah you know and the anointing has been relevant and and and and around for forever amen you know at the earliest times where God called man the anointing was there but one thing I've I've I've come to look at and notice and you know uh uh your your pastor by the grace of God he he Pro he preached a message at the at the men's meeting lifting lifted lifting him up how how how was it Go lifted up From the Ashes amen you know and it was just so many things he said in that you know it just it it tuck me to a place to where I begin to ask myself am I growing in Christ you know and all together church we ought to be asking ourself are we growing in Christ now let's just start with the anointing Hallelujah when the anointing when the rain comes Hallelujah the Bible said at just the smell of it at the smell of it at the smell of water something begins to connect with that seed and life begins to come forth now if I ask the question how do you respond in church when the rain falls how do you respond when the anointing comes in the midst of bethl Hallelujah now it's the same rain Hallelujah that's that's that's falling in denominations hallelujah amen they seeing some of the same songs they're inspired by some of the same music but the question is when the rain comes it's something being unlocked in your life because clearly in job the Bible says that that this tree can be cut down and when the root Hallelujah comes in contact with the smell of water something begins to be unlocked and It prepares itself to grow again Hallelujah even though it went to a season where something cut it down it went to a season where something was dry just the smell of water Hallelujah just just the presence of that anointing that rain unlock something in that tree to say I want to give more hallelujah hallelujah and and one of the the reasons why I believe we go I'm going this way because uh in my travels I look around and I go places and people don't even respond when the anointing is falling we've gotten so used to uh good songs and a good song service you know and the presence of God comes down the rain comes down Hallelujah to drive demons away the rain comes down to give us strength the rain comes down in the power of his resurrection and we don't even respond to it but the rain comes so it can unlock something in the seed Hallelujah but not only unlock it comes and it falls so that you don't remain in the same condition that's the purpose of the anointing the anointing comes to break yolks the anointing comes to destroy the whole that the enemy has on you amen these songs these atmospheres that we are experiencing not for us to walk out the same way we came in but it's supposed to ignite something in our lives something Hallelujah is is supposed to respond when the rain comes hallah we us to sing a song open the floodgates of Heaven Let It Rain think about that Hallelujah if the rain is coming from the heavens hallelujah amen and we don't acknowledge it that means we're not even understanding his presence Hallelujah am oh my but look the reason why I said sing rain different light Hallelujah because we all have seen maybe churches online or whatever uh uh let me take the group um that everybody's listening to right now uh Maverick City I keep going I get you now but you take some of the songs they sing like promises and and all the rest of them you know what I'm talking about some of the these same songs that we listen to Under the inspiration of the rain Hallelujah see it's the same rain they feel the presence of God just like we do Hallelujah but the difference is the light Hallelujah see there's two things that's going on Hallelujah even in the service church one the rain which is the anointing and the other is the light Hallelujah the light is what the word Hallelujah people have experienced the anointing but there's a different light that we walk in Hallelujah if I can by the grace of God I want to read to you what the what the prophet of God said see what we ought to do is uhh not uh if I could say it like this let worship and things get so common to us on because when it gets common then it starts to lose its fire right when it gets caling Hallelujah then it starts to lose the effect of it Hallelujah and normally when things get common to us hallelujah we just ignore it when it gets common to us I never want the rain presence anointing of God to get common to me cuz it's those times Hallelujah when you least expected when God is in the room church for a moment Hallelujah ask yourself are you conscious of God are we conscious when we worship that you're not worshiping brother Tony Hallelujah these songs we sing We Sing unto almighty God hallelujah these brothers that are playing the instruments and sisters that are playing the instruments is not unto their own doing but it's for one reason Hallelujah and is to exalt the [Applause] king but when the rain falls how do we respond to the Rain listen the prophet of God say he says now we can do many things we can take communion Hallelujah we can be baptized we can come to church have our names on the book or just be or or be just as respect and reverent as we can be and still be Lov oh my think about that you can sit in the presence a god reverent you can be baptized pay your tithes do all these things and still be lost amen amen he said that's a solemn he said that's a solemn warning we could be just as just rejoice when the spirit would fall and in a meeting when the word was being preached and our souls would just Rejoice with the word and still be lost listen what he says the rain falls on the just and unjust now if I can stop right there Hallelujah the anointing the Bible brother DS ain't making us up the Bible the the Bible says that the rain the anointing is in the message and is in denominations all right that's hallelujah hallelujah or should I say it like this the rain when it falls in our midst Hallelujah people people with the Holy Ghost are blessed and people without the Holy Ghost are blessed Hallelujah and brother Jason I think that's what the problem is we walk out experiencing the rain and we walk out saying I'm all right no we must come into a birth H we must come into an experience with God where when God comes we acknowledge his presence all of creation acknowledges the sun when it rises not by choice they don't have a choice cuz nothing's going to stop the Sun from rising well listen he said the rain falls on the just and the unjust the same rain that makes the wheat grow makes weeds grow hallelujah amen but if I could say it like this my inspiration is tonight church is are you growing amen hallelujah amen we experience good Services good word good atmospheres but are you growing cuz the only reason why Hallelujah rain connects with the seed is to unlock the life that life may come forth now there's two things that a seed must have it must have Water and Light you're already dirt hallelujah hallelujah we already five and six feet of dirt so there's two things that we need need in our journey one is water we need a holy a holy ghost filled atmosphere H we need to come in contact with the anointing of God the rain of God H cuz it's by that rain that you grow it's by that rain that it unlock something in your life Hallelujah to give back to God what he put inside of you Hallelujah you see how important it is to respond when the rain is falling Hallelujah that seed is no good if it doesn't come in contact with rain amen hallelujah it can't grow without water am it can't produce without water we need the anointing but don't take it for granted no I ain't going to be long I'm about to close but church if we look and we examine think about how many powerful worship Services we've had and we walk out with the same struggles we walk out with the same problems the same questions the anointing came to do something in your life hallelujah amen and I love how the Pastor said it's it's it's lifting us up hallelujah amen it's not by choice but when we get in the presence of God this is the thing I want you to understand in that atmosphere fear when the rain Hallelujah is falling either you're yielding or resisting some people don't like rain cuz they don't want to be touched Hallelujah but sometimes the rain Hallelujah it'll identify what kind of material you are now I got certain shoes that I wear I don't like to wear in the rain because the what the rain will do the rain will War the the material or or mess it up so I don't wear that kind of stuff in the rain but then there are some things in the rain that are waterproof Hallelujah and you know what church there are too many Christians Hallelujah that are waterproof Hallelujah there too many Christians that can be in the presence of God and not be touched that to me people that can experience the rain and not be affected H I don't know about you guys but when I'm in a storm and I run from my car Hallelujah when I run from my car to the house I get wet I get affected by the storm Hallelujah sometimes I have to go and change clothes sometimes I have to go wash wipe my head Hallelujah but I get touched by the rain Hallelujah ask yourself we was the last time you were touched by the rain no I'm not trying to make you jump and Shout I'm asking you are you growing that's cuz the rain comes to unlock that seed even though it's been cut down even though it's been cut down when the rain falls something is supposed to be unlocked now you ask yourself am I in the same spot I was in last year that means you're not growing even though you're experiencing the same rain same rain yeah same rain same song leader same musicians some of the same songs same church same atmosphere and you are still in the same place spiritually something's wrong with that picture Hallelujah either Hallelujah you're not hallah being Reverend to the anointing H or you're ignoring it wow amen that's the thing about being a free more agent Hallelujah listen you say well brother DS what do you mean look hallu there are people hallelujah in this church that used to do specials I haven't heard do a special in years does that mean you're growing or you're dodging the rain think about it Hallelujah when the anointing fall because it's supposed to bring more out of you hallelujah how often we leave a good service and we knew God was in there we knew God talked to us and we walk out with the same attitude church now I I'm preaching to myself also because I feel like all of us who are still here that means we have haven't obtained yet that means there's still room for growth Hallelujah there's still more that God wants to unlock out of your life Hallelujah I've seen Hallelujah young people pray and pray for a spouse and then they get the spouse and they disappear anointed too anointed lies same rain different light so we can see that the rain Hallelujah the rain the anointing Hallelujah that's the type of the rain the anointing he says he says um he says in that day I'm going go back and read it Isaiah 10 it says and it shall come to pass in that day that is burden shall be taken away from off thy shoulders some of you got heavy shoulders you know why cuz you're dodging the anointing whoa oh my he said in his Yol from off thy neck and the Yoke shall be destroyed because of the rain because of the anointing how often do we come to church and we look for deliverance Hallelujah I ain't talking about a special meeting hallelujah sister J what about what about I'm sorry you're not sister J she look like a little bit but but but think about what if we Hallelujah are in a place in our life Hallelujah before we get to Camp amen before we get to Camp we're already anointed before we get to Camp we're already walking in his presence before we come back Sunday morning we've already bathed in the rain H the rain not just a drizzle but a downpour you bathed and you labored In God's Presence till all your yolks and burdens have been destroyed because of the rain what if right now you would tap into the anointing God would do something special in your life but what do we do we resist the anointing because people are afraid of emotion and if I can hallelujah what you call the thing uh a pet peeve I got a pet peeve amen why all of a sudden Ministries are badgering the worship come on come on why all of a sudden Ministries are taking a stab at the worship H because it's the enemy Hallelujah trying to keep you from Catching the anointing trying to keep you from Catching your freedom and your Liberty by looking at Hallelujah the way you worship and the way it sound who cares long as I get delivered oh brother you were just a little too loud KN oh brother no kicking and shouting you know what you people that feel like that I doubt they could have been in brother Brandon's meetings they say that message Believers but when they see the anointing sometimes they fall under the same tree that the Sadducees and Pharisees fall under because yeah they were fundamental yeah they had all their Traditions but when Jesus came who was the opening of the word who was the anointing himself they called it a devil my and it's still the same Spirit looking at the true anointing of God calling it a devil praise God onlu but I refuse to become cold formal and Powerless I I refuse to be a church with no testimony I refuse to be a church Hallelujah that'll be quiet about the goodness of God oh watch it brother you don't want to be too emotional bunch of nonsense well if you think I'm too emotional let me explain something to you I escaped death H spiritually and naturally Hallelujah tomb in my brain with the with Witnesses saying that I'll never be able to do what I'm doing right now that I wouldn't live past a certain age that I wouldn't be able to have children Hallelujah amen and everything they said I wouldn't be able to do God made it possible and you don't want me to shout in your church well I'm sorry then Escape diabetes blood conditions and all these things and you don't want me to be emotional you don't understand the rain in my life you don't understand that when God comes down it's a downpour it's not just a dral hallelujah it's baptism after baptism drench after drench rain after rain [Music] Hallelujah I feel like brother Brown he said when Billy Paul was was in the bars and doing all these things he said one thing for for sure he'll have to walk over my Christian Life if my kids ever go and live in the world H they're going to go with the testimony saying God my daddy was a worshipper Hallelujah my daddy was not stone wall Jackson no uhuh he was a worshipper praise God yes sir Hallelujah he's a descendant of Aza Hallelujah yeah we're afraid of these things Hallelujah but it's a part of the rain Aza is a part of the rain yeah we're under a different light now but it's still a part of who we are you can't take that away from us yes sir cuz all of it makes up the seed that's right and forgive me if I sound like I'm fussing no I just want to let you know it's all right to be free hallelujah it's all right to be free Hallelujah go it's all right to feel the joy of the Lord hallelujah it's all right to be in church and smile every now and then come on who wants a gospel that can't even put a smile on your face who wants a gospel you walk in the church and you oh man oh man the prophet said and that's all you got come on brother this rain has to become an experience when you go to a good concert it becomes an experience when you go to a good meeting it becomes an experience and let me tell you something if you ever come in contact with the real genuine Holy Spirit flowing in the church it becomes an experience that you want every time you [Applause] come Hallelujah almost feel like the the um I can't think of their name but LBT l o p q TRV Community Hallelujah every time you turn around they got a new set of rules and they're so aggressive want you to do it their way if you don't do it their way you in trouble well I'm sorry Hallelujah lb GT Qs of the message Hallelujah I'm going to do it the way God is leading see I I Church forgive me but I don't believe in the same service one minute you can be anointed by God in the next minute anointed by the [Music] devil oh oh my church I preached a message on dealing with the Masterpiece and I use some quotes from Michelangelo and my subject was stay with division but one thing Michelangelo had to Hallelujah do he had to have his mind in a certain place Hallelujah to where all the distractions wouldn't deter his vision all the distractions with with with life wouldn't destroy what was in his mind Hallelujah and there's one place he says hallelujah if you knew what it take Hallelujah to get where I am you wouldn't want to follow me oh my church we haven't come through a Hallelujah a bed of ease so I say to all of you you have a right to rejoice in God oh my if we can hit it if we can hit it real good you got a right to clap on a 2 4 or 13 a 56 a 8 n however the Lord want to leave you to praise you praise am oh my but are you growing in the presence of that rain Hallelujah because the rain comes to pull something out of you yes now that's the first initiation all right we've EXP experience the rain but now the other thing that happens with the seed when it rains what also makes it grow is the light you need light but we don't have the same light we have a different light a more complex light oh my church you know as time went along don't get nervous I ain't gonna be too much longer you know as time went along how they how they projected light it progressed Hallelujah but it was always there amen only a certain group of people could walk in that light the revealing of that light now look Hallelujah the Bible says Thy word is a lamp unto my feet and a light unto my path Hall so the word is a type of light Hallelujah see we don't have the same light that Luther had we don't have the same light that Noah had H we don't have the same light that Moses had we got the same rain but a different light Hallelujah he's still the same God the same anointing throughout the generations but now there's a different message Hallelujah because there's a different achievement or overcoming that God wants from this church are you growing in the light hallelujah look he said Thy word is a lamp unto my feet Hallelujah the light a light unto my path oh my so church as we walk in the light it illuminates our direction it'll show you where you should go and where you shouldn't go that's what the word of the hour will do if you're participating and paying attention in it and let me say like this when the true anointing Falls it'll make you want to go study oh that was kind of weak I hope y'all not waiting on the ministry to give it all to you on hallelujah look I just want to give you some forms of light one form of light is called hologen we've heard of that right a hologen light is is this that kind of light it gives you a natural feeling of white light now everything I'm going to every every every form of light I'm talking about I want you to put it in a bulb amen and you take a hologen and put it in a bulb it's it's it's a it's a natural filling of white light but then there's another one called incandesent it said this light Hallelujah is heated up until it glows amen wow oh my it's still anointed H but now it's a different light Hallelujah one light is is is is is there to feel more natural or more natural white but this light Hallelujah the next light is heated up Hallelujah but when it projects white it looks like it's glowing Hallelujah when was the last time the word was in your life and you felt like you were glowing you feel like the word was having such an effect in your life that when somebody seeing you they say when I see you I see the [Music] F John the Baptist was glowing oh my the disciples Hallelujah they were glowing oh my listen those are two forms of life but then if we keep going in the stages of life light the light gets brighter there's another light called fluorescent fluorescent it gives off a color of white see not only is it white but it's giving off the natural color of white it's not glowing but when you look at florescent see the thing about fuorescent fluorescent light you can add different colors in it amen oh my but the one I like is the one I think we're all familiar with LED most of our cars have what kind of light LED because LED is 90% brighter than the other ones I named but it's still light what makes it brighter Hallelujah LED light Hallelujah it lights up 90% more efficient Hallelujah than the other lights because they said there's a certain energy moving through the bu Hallelujah there's more energy moving through a LED Hall see it's not just coming to church it's not just Co but an experience there there's something that's taking place there's an energy there they can feel God in the room Hallelujah we need an LED experience amen that's right aise God it's still like but it's giving off more energy some of us we come to church and we give off the same energy every time we come come on we hear we experience the anointing sing good songs and we hear good preaching and this is all the energy we have your amens are not even a voice what kind of energy is that do you think God will respond to that Hall you get what you expect hallelujah hallelujah oh my look church amen listen what the prophet of God says and I and I ain't going to be too much longer by the grace of God but I want to I want I want to show that Hallelujah that seed you and I our seeds in these two things every time we come to service every time yes we need to experience the water the rain amen the anointing and we also need to be present when the light is shining not your mind drifting off way know because this light this light what is it doing every time that light comes in contact with that seed it pulls it up a little bit higher just like the Su n when it comes in contact Hallelujah with the S D it what does it do it has the effect to pull it out of its conditions it pulls it out out of the dirt pulls it out of the surroundings and nothing can stop it once it comes in contact why because there's something on the inside happening you can have a hurricane and a hurricane come through and tear everything up but when that season of light comes back around that seed will continue to grow just like it did Hallelujah prise God look listen what the prophet of God says are you happy tonight cuz you know y'all know I've been going around and there's something that our churches have been missing we've been hearing the word all this time years and years and years and we've gotten mature come on come on come on I'm mature we don't we don't need all that brother dicks that's just you're just a little too radical on what we need to get back in church brother Matt in unison this is our power come on brother this is our power when you interact with the word with this how can God resist when you tell God you know what this says when you say this this means I believe this means god you're talking to me this means just like Mary be it unto me according to the word that I just [Applause] heard but we become good message Believers with no interaction with the [Music] anointing we get more exced excited about things that ain't going to do nothing for our life I guarantee that some of you are watching the debate last night a't ain't going to do nothing for you right we already got the light we already know what's going to happen Hallelujah we already know what's going to happen when we come to church we ought to be that more excited Hallelujah we got a man running and they can't be that that they can't control and we got a woman that'll take power which will be a prophecy and we come to church with no oh my oh mylah church just in case you forgot the anointing is not in the music come on no the anointing is not in the music the anointing is in your revelation of how you see God hallelujah hallelujah that's where the anointing lies Hallelujah cuz you look at it when David Hallelujah begin to fight Goliath he wasn't fighting with his own strength he was fighting by Revelation and that anointing that was there to help him defeat a lion and a bear was there to meet him when he fought Goliath what no music playing what was that anointing that anointing was supreme power under control knowing how and what Hallelujah now is the time David said but what we've done we've made it a a good song I pledge alance to the and there's nothing wrong with worship and worship and songs Hallelujah but is God still there when there's no music can you still say listen the prophet of God tells a story he's sitting in the living room and he's telling some of the Saints about the third pool he's talking about the Silver Tip Grizzly he's talking about Hallelujah the storm on the mountain he's talking about the little fish that rolls Hallelujah he's talking about the caribou and there was a woman sitting there listening who wasn't there at any of those events but she caught the anointing she caught the anointing for salvation hallu she caught the anointing for the supernatural by just doing what saying but just saying that ain't nothing but the truth you know when she was telling the prophet she was saying so be it and the devil don't want us to amen the word the devil don't want us to be free enough to say hallelujah he don't want us to be free enough to say thank you Jesus for the word that's your power thank you Lord and don't give me that non sense that's just the way I'm built yeah you need to be torn down and rebuilt Hallelujah but she's sitting there and she is listening to all the stuff the prophet was saying and she wasn't there at none of those events but something was clicking the rain was coming down was no instruments being played hallelujah amen was no music nothing just the light begin to Shine the Light begin to shine for her same anointing H listen to me Church listen to me good oh my this is fresh the same anointing that was there on the mountain the same anointing that was there with the bear in The Caribou the same anointing that was there with the little fish was the same anointing right there in that living room when she said stay ain't nothing but the truth it was the same anointing Hallelujah same anointing shining on another seed church we can experience some of the same things that the prophet experienced if we would just amen the word that's why I ain't got time to be fussing and arguing with people about what's right and what ain't right huah Sons and Daughters of God are led by what the spirit of God can you imagine God if I see brother Matt worshiping and I said come on Matt man you got to got to do a little bit better than that I want see you shake a leg a little bit brother Jason you met Brother Sam Brother Sam about 6465 but he loves to come around and worship and he just be smiling while we be wor I said come on Sam all you got to do is start shaking your leg a little bit just a little bit just shake it a little bit you'll get going he just laughs He Just Smiles but he ain't told me this but I guarantee when he get home he be like why does he do it at home not Sam if you watch this Sam I'm just using you for illustration you still my guy it's my brother from another mother but why does he do it at home because he feels more free when we ought to feel free In God's Presence sir Hallelujah but what the enemy tries to do he tries to make us feel ridiculous sorry I'm sorry you ain't gonna make me feel like that Hallelujah listen listen what the prophet of God says I'm going to read something in the same message and then I'mma back up a little bit I want to come down to this point this is a message um a man Eternal Light the prophet of God says all natural life comes by his spoken word and the Sun is his spoken word the Su n is his spoken word how he said let there be light and it appeared amen so light appearing is the manifestation of the spoken word being spoken amen catch me now yes sir listen he said the son is his spoken word he said he said he created a great light in the heavens for the day and a lesser night a lesser light for the night see and all natural life has to come by God's spoken word hallelujah amen see so as we're experiencing as we're experiencing the the anointing and the rain Hallelujah let's not try to live a word for another day Hallelujah so we take this message of the hour the message playing for young it didn't come to bind you it didn't come to make you feel a certain oh I can't go to the movies I can't weigh dresses I mean yeah you can weigh dresses I can't weigh pants and I I I can't cut my hair and I can't weigh uhh uh earrings and I want my butterfly eyelashes the word for our day the light it didn't come to bind you but it came to show you a more excellent way a more acceptable way that the light in your life would continue to shine wow Hallelujah that's what it's about church if you experience the rain Hallelujah and the light what does it do it brings you into a place where you continuously walk with Goden and that's what we want we want to walk with God hallelujah cuz the spoken word is walking in the light for your day Hallelujah really simple you want to know what the Holy Ghost is make your desires listen he says a flower cannot grow without light of God's spoken words shine upon it now he's typing a flower which is you and he said a flower cannot grow without God's spoken words shining on it you'll never glow grow until you stop dodging the light oh my I'm going Jump Around in here a little bit if you don't mind he said the word shine upon it for the S the Su in is the spoken word of God when he said let there be light see it's God's spoken life and no matter how much people try to say this that or the other it Still Remains the Same see Hallelujah same anointing different light it Remains the Same you have to have the Sun so life natural can only come by the spoken word of God so if you're looking for life if you're looking for a connection Hallelujah if you're looking to grow you must connect with the spoken word of God Amen that's why church is important not to become a tradition to you and we are very traditional very traditional amen very traditional no I'm not no I'm not brother I am not traditional I'm right I prove it to you you're very traditional no I a I ain't traditional I believe in everything that the prophet said I am not traditional you are very traditional yeah prove it I prove it every service you come you sit in the seat you're sitting in it never fails a wedn to you're there Sunday you're there special meeting you're there amen but let me show you something ain't no power in the seat Amen Let me see [Applause] Glory nope still feel the same see your Traditions will never bring you closer to God what it'll do is make things more common to you it'll even put an attitude on you if you come in and somebody else sitting in your seat somebody else sitting in your [Applause] tradition you won't even hardly get pass it don't you walk look at that seat now you got a mind Bal now they know they know that's my seat come on they know that's where I normally sit she just doing that out of Spike and then you get so aggravated you call your sister your brother the devil that ain't nothing but the devil sitting in my seat keep in mind ain't no power in that seat it's your perception let me tell you something Hallelujah you can sit right here see I almost grabbed one of y'all you can sit right here hallelujah and the same anointing will fall right here it's all based upon your expectation but if you're traditional Hallelujah you'll come and get locked in with no expectation because you're where you're supposed to be brother Jason brother Matt Caleb different ones I hope the next time y'all preach they be in a different seat show the ministry that you care about the light amen listen I'm about to come down to the close and I know some of you going to be stubborn oh yeah you going to be stubborn you going to come in and you going to sit right down in your seat and you going to sit in that seat and this is what you going to be saying in your mind I know they looking at me but I don't care what brother dig say this this where I'm comfortable and that's why you miss God because you've become comfortable I don't never want the presence of God to get comfortable to me Hallelujah I want him to shake me up every time I come H I want to expect the unexpected HJ I want God to sweep in and touch me like he didn't touch me last week I want God to come in and speak words to me that I've never heard before I don't want to be comfortable Hallelujah I want to be alert I want to be on edge Hallelujah I want to be All Shook Up I want to be to a place almost I'm I'm just almost uh shaking because I don't know what he's going to do next am am that's where I want to beu I want to be all traditional and all got everything together I'm a message believer you know who was like that the Sadducees and Pharisees they were so traditional with Moses's message that when Hallelujah The Light Came they were stuck in the same anointing amen come on The Light Came Hallelujah and they called it a devil because it didn't match up with their Traditions that's right I'm all right I know you know people call me all kind of stuff it's all good my mama still call me by name you can say what you want just spell my name right Hallelujah and now I'm getting to a place where I'm correcting people on how they pronounce it it's been too long for people to be still calling me kidy Hallelujah on it's like Sky Kai Dre all right Kai Dre all right okay praise the Lord but look what the prophet of God says this is what the prophet of God says he says now what God separates Darkness from light or light from darkness and he separates death from life and he does it by his word his word is what always brings this forth amen see so church is not just only the anointing that separates us it's the word that we're hearing it's the word that you're living that separates you from any denomination hallelujah it's the light that you're walking in it's the path that's been illuminated hallelujah it's all these things that coincide with the revealing of light that makes you who you are Hallelujah so when we come to church we ought not just to be here to be here but there should be an expectation and a participation Hallelujah I'm going ask the question again tonight are you growing because the rain causes the seed to unlock and the light pulls the seed out of its present condition Hallelujah so if we got the rain which is the anointing and we got the word which is the light we should be different we should be growing Hallelujah God we shouldn't be just coming around with the same old experiences the same old testimony no there should be growth in our journey Hallelujah sir he says now light well now need was always was was already upon the earth I believe God had planned plant the seed and just as long as the sun could get to that seed it begin to grow and I believe in this church God can get to the seed let's stop blocking the light and let's open up the way so the light can just Shine On Us yeah we experience the anointing the anointing is here but let's let the word have its way in our life Hallelujah listen he says and that's the way God has today his seed is already here somebody say amen he said his word the only thing it needs is light right amen and I believe in this church the truth of the light is is being preached so what what am I saying that we should be growing you you you you can call me crazy but I believe when we come to church Supernatural things should take place every time we come if the anointing is here if God is here there should be a testimony every service amen amen sometimes God to do things and you're not even aware of it Hallelujah he said the only thing it needs is light upon it and he is that light for he is the word the word and the light is the same thing right are you with me Church the light I'm talking about is the word which is the same thing the word and the light is the same thing the life is in there in the light of the word see is the life Hallelujah your life is where in the word that you're hearing for your day amen and as long as the anointing is present Hallelujah and the word comes forth we should be experiencing spiritual growth amen amen when your baby is born you don't expect that baby to stay an infant but you expect that baby to grow and as it's growing you're teaching it h based upon what is going to become you teach it how to walk why because you knew the potential was already there you teaching how to talk why because you knew the potential was already there Hallelujah God teaches us how to walk spiritually why because he knows the potential is already there God teaches us how to talk spiritual why because he knows the potential is already there amen Hallelujah pise God some of us have been babies too long and if that one ain't good enough for you I got it in blood too Church let's get on the edile seats Hallelujah let's stop getting trapped in true tradition on let's stop getting trapped in walls of religion and let get back to being free as God made us hallelujah where God can have his way with our lives but we would come and expect to be touched by God we would come and expect to hear from God we would come and expect Our Lives to be changed Hallelujah I was in um I was in in in in in in in South Africa about 3 weeks ago you know the story of the woman Memphis Tennessee she had a need and she first thing she did was identify herself as a Bible character hallelujah what was she doing she was living into the light for her day she made the Bible become present God oh my am church I was in Durban and I was preaching some Services before I got there there was a young man heard I was coming about

been fulfilled and he says that young man right there he had a request from God Hallelujah against my will Hallelujah remember the plane came down against the prophet's will that's right Hallelujah he didn't know what was happening but there was a woman who had a request Hallelujah and and that request changed up the prophet schedule Hallelujah church I'm telling you Hallelujah when the light and the anointing come together in your life you have the ability to change things Hallelujah hey you know that young man said I don't care how it happens but brother digs needs to be here preaching to me as I turn 21 and church the very thing he desired the very thing he spoke got me there in his church preaching to him on his 21st birthday so you know what I don't have to talk about a woman from

going to say Amen let's bring the expectation back in the church remember the prodical son had a brother who didn't know his position right amen he got angry yeah because his his father reached out to

from God just in the service and it was met I just want to thank him for that amen praise the Lord during the preaching of the word while Peter yet spake these words God keeps his promises amen God bless you everyone I just wanted to share this um my wife and I just got back from trip of a life Lifetime and God did three wonderful things for me so I just want to give him the praise for it when we first got on the plane at New York and we were going to Athens the um you're supposed to take your laptop out of course you all know that's my bread and butter so you put it in a bin and then behind that they want you to take everything else out so your wallet your passport your money everything and then my bag and it goes through the thing and they aren't paying any attention it gets all bound up my laptop top flips over falls and hits the floor all my money my passport everything right underneath their equipment wow and I started freaking out and of course I get on my hands and knees and crawl around and I get everything and the laptop's okay and I was just very thankful that the Lord protected it and then several days later we flew to an island from Athens and um I was so busy trying to get off the plane helping people get their luggage from up above actually left my phone on the plane and I didn't even realize it until we got to where we were staying an hour later and I asked the driver I'm like you got to turn around you got to take me back to the airport and so I go back to the airport I'm expecting him and he speaks Greek I don't I'm expecting him to help me right and we pull up and he's like all right I'll be out here driving in circles good [Laughter] luck I just started praying I was like Lord just tell me what to do and um I couldn't get anybody anywhere to help me so I finally decided I'll just walk where I'm not supposed to walk in security and I'll get all kinds of attention and sure enough I had two police officers come up to me and they explain and I explained and I went and got a a piece of paper that said lost and found and they let me back there thank God somebody on that plane saw my phone and it was the one got phone back while I was there and then the third thing that happened to us and I'm just so thankful so I had hurt my foot and I told my wife I'm like you might as well put me in a wheelchair and just get one of them wheel things and and so the lady was helping us and she was putting all the luggage and Mike and I she started pushing me we were laughing having fun there's a little video on Facebook but we didn't NE one realize it we were in Charlotte and that was on the way home we had another flight 3 hours later 15 minutes before we get on the other flight we realized that neither myself nor my wife nor that lady had taken my luggage and put it underneath that thing and there's no way we were ever going to get in time we had to go back out go to security and all that I just started praying I was like all right Lord just it's whatever it wasn't even tagged I actually had carried it on the plane so it didn't have they couldn't trace it or nothing so I get home and I call my buddy that lives in Charlotte I'm like will you do me a favor will you please go to the lost and found in the Charlotte Airport and uh I see that my luggage is in the airport because I have a tracer on it and after about five different people send him in all these different directions he finally sends me a picture back of my luggage so God did that those three things for me and I just want to give him praise for it and I I thank him for watching over us and all the little things that he does yeah amen amen anybody else before we go praise the lordon oh where you at okay go ahead brother um Saturday we were driving home from town and our car threw a check engine light which whatever check engine light but this one made it go into limp mode so we couldn't go over like 25 miles an hour so I was freaking out and our our car is too smart for its own Goods so it sent us a text message like hey there's something wrong with your uh drivetrain you need to take it to the dealership immediately and so I was like oh great so I went to the auto part store immediately cuz the dealership wasn't open and had him check the code and it was a p1061 there's a recall out on my car right now for catastrophic engine failure but they don't have the stuff to do all the recall on everybody's car right at the second so basically they're just doing them as they blow up and so so I took it to the dealership and uh on Monday and they didn't get a chance to look at it and I was like oh man what are we going to do so I was like like well let's just go run a car so we went to the Run Place they didn't have any cars so I was like okay well I guess we'll just figure it out there's three other people living at my house besides my family and so we've got cars we'll figure it out and um so they called me um Tuesday and before that I went and pulled that recall notice out and it said it your car will throw code p161 um just bringing to the dealership I was like oh great and then I was looking at the fin it's like this uh this recall is good for 10 years 100,000 Mi well I got 155,000 Mi on my car even though it's only not even three years old yet but um was like great I guess I'm going to have to put an engine in myself so they call me to on uh Tuesday and he's like hey uh Simmons you're um we checked out your car uh everything seems to be fine we went ahead and reset the check engine light and we've been driving around and it hasn't come back on so uh basically just take it home and drive it if the check in light comes back on just bring it back to us we'll replace the engine under warranty I was like are you sure I was like CU I just check the recall notice and he looked up on the computer he's like yeah he says we'll cover it to up to 150,000 miles he said but there is an amendment in here that it is doesn't there's no mileage uh limit up to September of 2025 so I'll get a free engine if it does decide to blow up I guess wow but it's it's we drove it tonight so it's it's running amen I've sure had the Lord lay his hands on engines and vehicles for me through my life amen wonderful testimonies tonight Brother Brad I'm not sure if I ever want to go on a trip with you because a lot of things happen
