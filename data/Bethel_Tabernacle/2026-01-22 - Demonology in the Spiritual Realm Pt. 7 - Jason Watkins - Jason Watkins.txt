You're not a stranger to the heavy load. When the sorrow overflows the banks of the river of my soul, would you whisper comfort in a peaceful word? You're not a stranger to the winds that blow. And oh my savior, you're not a stranger to the winds that blow. And oh my savior, you're not a stranger to the heavy load.

We're trying to get him to get him up there, get him back, and Amen. get him get him hunkered down. Amen. Praise the Lord. Ephesians chapter 4. Guess what? I thought I was finished Sunday with the um um with the series on demonology in the spiritual realm. But I don't get to choose that. That ain't that ain't up to me. So, I was finished as far as I knew. And uh lo and behold, the Lord began to really stir my heart yesterday, you know, with uh quite a bit more. Not quite a bit more. I should be able to finish it tonight. Amen. Amen. Well, I mean, I could be wrong. The rapture could come in the next five minutes. Wouldn't that be wonderful? Praise the Lord. Wouldn't have to preach this at all. Amen. Could lay our uh lay our burdens down. Amen. Amen. Happy for that. What a what a morning that'll be. Ephesians chapter 4 verses 1. We're going to read 1-6. We'll just read a few and let you be seated. I therefore, the prisoner of the Lord, beseech you that you walk worthy of the vocation wherewith ye are called, with all loneliness and meekness, with longsuffering, forbearing one another in love, endeavoring to keep the unity of the spirit in the bond of peace. There is one body and one spirit. Even as you are called in one hope of your calling, one Lord, one faith, one baptism, one God and Father of all, who is above all and through all and in you all. Now, it's amazing that in the continuation of of our reading, it's very clear in these first six verses, it should be clear to you by now that Paul is speaking to born again believers &gt;&gt; who are he says that full of the spirit of God, one God and father of all who is above all and through all and in you all. So, is there any doubt this these are believers? But yet he's going to go on down in our reading as we continue after we pray and seat you. And he's going to start talking about the necessity uh to to come into the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the son of God and unto a perfect man under the stature under under the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ that we hence be no more tossed about like children. And he's talking to born again people. Amen. &gt;&gt; All right, let's pray. Father, we thank you for your word. And I just am eager, Lord, to get into the material tonight. And so, Father, we're just calling you on the scene and asking you now to be with us, everyone. We have number of sick requests that have come in tonight. And so, we're asking for your mercy for them, Lord. And we'll take up prayer requests just shortly in a more expansive way. But for now Lord may you help us and reveal the word to us. These are important hour important time that we live in. So we commit it to you in Jesus name. Amen. God bless. You can be seated. All right let's carry on in our reading verse seven. But unto every one of us is given grace according to the measure of the gift of Christ. Wherefore he saith, when he ascended up on high, he led captivity captive, and gave gifts unto men. Now that he ascended, what is it? But that he also descended first into the lower parts of the earth. He that descended is the same also that ascended up far above all heavens that he might fill all things. And he gave some apostles. Now he's going to he's going to break down the gifts. He gave gifts unto men. We just read that. And he he led captivity captive and gave gifts unto men. Now the reason that he gave part of the reason he gave these gifts unto men is expressed in that seventh verse. He unto every one of us is given grace according to the measure of the gift of Christ. So we're all different. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But we all have one faith, one Lord, one baptism, one spirit. We're gifted severally. We're, you know, we're, you know, different in our nature, different in our temperaments. You know, we're we're different in our gender. We're different in our zodiac. We're different in our raising. We're different in our culture. and and but yet we're all one spirit, one faith, one body. So So the way that he's going to bring all of these these various parts that are all supposed to fit together, only nobody knows how to fit them together. So, he's going to bring forth the Holy Spirit, give us a new birth, and then send forth ministry of the word to to put it all together everywhere where it's supposed to go and fit it close together so that we operate as one unified body of Christ. G God dwelt in the unified body of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; And that's always the goal. Just because that there were 120 on the in the upper room and then 3,000 and then thousands more and then it spread to all the world. HE STILL WANTS IT. His goal has always been to get oneness. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To reestablish oneness. &gt;&gt; And so he says and he gave some apostles and some prophets and some evangelists and some pastors and teachers. Now catch it. Catch it. These bornagain people full of the Holy Spirit, but they still need this ministry for the perfecting of the saints, &gt;&gt; for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ, till we all come into the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ. Why? that we henceforth be no more children tossed to and fro, carried about with every wind of doctrine by the slight OF MEN. YOU WOULDN'T THINK THAT COULD HAPPEN. &gt;&gt; YOU KNOW, THE OLD THING IS JUST GUESS JUST JUST GET THE HOLY GHOST AND IT FIX ALL THE PROBLEMS. We're finding out that THE HOLY GHOST OPENS YOU UP TO THE HOLY SPIRIT NOW BEING ABLE TO grow you and mature you and bring you INTO THE STATURE OF THE FULLNESS of Christ. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; Right. That we henceforth be no more children tossed to and fro. carried about with every wind of doctrine by the slight of men and cunning craftiness whereby they lay and wait to deceive. But speaking the truth in love, catch this language. May we may grow up into him. GROW UP INTO HIM in all things, which is the head, even Christ, FROM WHOM THE WHOLE BODY FITLY JOINED TOGETHER and compacted by that which EVERY JOINT SUPPLY to each other. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We're all in this together. &gt;&gt; All right. EVERY JOINT SUPPLY ACCORDING TO THE effectual working. See, now we're back to verse seven. the effectual working and the measure of every part. It maketh increase of the body UNTO THE EDIFYING OF itself in love. All right. Now, I'm going to invite you to Matthew chapter 18. Matthew chapter 18. We're going to catch these first four verses. Now Paul has just said we've got to grow up into all things so that we're not like children. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All right. Now Jesus in Matthew 18 at that at the same time certain at at that at the same time came the disciples unto Jesus saying who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven? And Jesus called a little child unto him, and set him in the midst of them, and said, Verily, I say unto you, except ye be converted, and become as little children, ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven. Whosoever therefore shall humble himself as this little child, the same is greatest in the kingdom of heaven. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; SO HE'S ADVOCATING THAT WE BE SPIRITUAL ADULTS, but in our faith and in our and in our observance of God's word, we act we humble ourselves like little children. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All right. Now, we're going to go somewhere. Now, let me just say that, you know, when you're talking about uh humbling ourselves as children, very little tiny children, very little, don't really have to do that. They don't even, you know, it it it and it takes a very a very young little child uh before they begin to recognize even that they are &gt;&gt; THEY THEY SUDDENLY NOTICE THEIR HANDS. YOU I I seen I remember raising kids AND SUDDENLY YOU SAW THEY NOTICED THEIR HAND. WOW, I HAVE HANDS. AND THEY'RE BECOMING AWARE AND and they they you know BUT BUT WHEN YOU CATCH THEM very young uh somewhere between infant and up to about YOU KNOW IT'S IN MONTHS OLD YOU KNOW NOT QUITE A YEAR SOMETIMES BY THE TIME THEY'RE A YEAR AND A HALF THAT'S WHY THEY CALL THEM terrible twos. Amen. It's okay mothers breathe. You'll get through it. I promise. Brother Eddie said listen grandkids are God's reward for not killing your kids. So, don't just just wait. Amen. But I I was uh I was I was in A IN A PARKING LOT THE other day and and I noticed um just sitting there and Sister Deb had went into a store and I was sitting there and there was a young mother who got out of the car and she went around and she uh took a very small baby. Couldn't have been more than about maybe six months old, six, seven months old at most. AND UH JUST JUST THE KIND THAT YOU WANT TO PINCH THEIR CHEEKS completely off and and she just TAKES THE BABY OUT AND YOU KNOW THE BABY'S JUST okay I'm being lifted out of a car I'M BEING CARRIED THE THE BABY'S NOT SAYING WHAT ARE YOU DOING WHY DID YOU WHY PUT ME DOWN SEE BECAUSE IT'S JUST A VERY LITTLE infant and she's she gets around back she pulls out a stroller you know her husband's coming around this way he's got a couple more little children they're older he's got them by the hand and he's helping her erect the stroller and AND SHE JUST SETS THE LITTLE GUY IN there and and I JUST NOTICED THAT SHE JUST PLOPPED HIM DOWN AND HE JUST, YOU KNOW, HE'S looking around. Okay, this is what we're doing. AND AND I JUST THOUGHT, YOU KNOW, HE DOESN'T EVEN HE'S NOT EVEN OLD ENOUGH YET TO KNOW HE HAS A will &gt;&gt; and that MAYBE HE DON'T WANT TO DO THAT. SEE, NOW, BROTHER BAM TALKS ABOUT THE LANGUAGE OF CRYING. IF THEY'RE HUNGRY, they they cry. That's how that's their language. That's how THEY GET FED. BUT THAT'S NOT THE SAME THING AS HIM DECIDING, HEY, YOU KNOW, MOM, I CAN I CAN, YOU KNOW, I DON'T REALLY WANT TO SIT in that. I mean, NOT ONLY IS SHE SETTING HIM IN IT AND HE'S COMPLETELY LIMBER TO IT, SHE'S ACTUALLY READJUSTING HIM AND FIXING HIM AND HE'S JUST LIKE, "OKAY, OKAY, IS THIS GOOD?" You know, AND ALL OF A SUDDEN, AND SHE'S GOT HIM AND SHE PUTS HIS LITTLE CAP ON AND HE'S LOOKING around and all of a sudden here she goes into the store. And I just thought about this scripture, Jesus saying, "Except you humble yourself and become like a little child." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; BY THE TIME THEY'RE ALMOST any age at all, you know, they they don't exactly sometimes they you feel a little bit of resistance when you take them by the hand. Sometimes you have to show some authority. Who's in charge here? But when it's a very LITTLE CHILD, THEY JUST PLOP DOWN WHEREVER YOU SET THEM OR YOU lay them on the bed, they lay there and they just look around. You know, YOU SIT THEM IN A HIGH CHAIR. THEY THEY'RE JUST SITTING THERE. They're waiting and and they AND AND IT'S IT TAKES A LITTLE WHILE FOR THEM TO START TO DEVELOP THEIR OWN LITTLE PERSONALITY BEFORE THEY SUDDENLY REALIZE, I GOT HANDS AND I'M A PERSON AND I THINK THEREFORE I AM AND I got a will and maybe I don't like that and I and I'm going to, you know, I'M GOING TO LET THE PARENT KNOW. BUT WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT THAT KIND OF A CHILD. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT a a a little child. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Jesus, I promise you, isn't saying you should be like a rebellious little terrible two. &gt;&gt; Some of his children unfortunately are, but you're not supposed to be. &gt;&gt; Amen. BUT BEFORE THE CHILD IS OLD ENOUGH TO recognize its own desires by I guess by being aware of its own life and its surroundings and as it becomes more self-aware and this then OPENS UP THE CHILD to its own desires and and and and then you can see some resistant to the parent you know when the when the parents direction conflicts with the child's desires All right. Amen. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; So, so Jesus said, you know, PAUL IS SAYING, DON'T BE LIKE LITTLE CHILDREN TOSSED ABOUT. THAT THAT'S SPIRITUAL IMMATURITY. &gt;&gt; YOU'RE BORN AGAIN OF THE SPIRIT OF GOD, BUT DON'T BE SPIRITUALLY IMMATURE. &gt;&gt; BECAUSE GOD IS LOOKING FOR MATURE, A MATURE BRIDE. JESUS WAS NEVER COMING BACK TO MARRY a little girl. HE'S COMING BACK TO MARRY A MATURE BRIDE. UH UH UH ready to BE UH SIT BESIDE HIM ON THE THRONE AND RULE AND REIGN WITH CHRIST. BUT YET WHEN IT COMES TO OUR BUT BUT WHEN IT COMES TO OUR SPIRITUAL MATURITY, A REAL SIGN OF SPIRITUAL MATURITY is a humility to act like a child. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; As it relates to your will &gt;&gt; versus God's will. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Brandham in the message oneness. It was a, you know, he had he had been in he spent, you know, in early 1962, he' he'd just come back in from Arizona and he had been all over Phoenix and Tempe and and preaching and and got home and he tells ON THE TAPE, YOU KNOW, I JUST got home last weekend, last Sunday. HE HE HE GOT INTO JEFFERSONVILLE JUST IN TIME FOR A SUNDAY NIGHT communion service there in the early first weekend of February. And then and then the very next Sunday now he's back in the pull pit. HE SAYS, "NOW LAST week we had communion showing that you KNOW IT'S A IT'S A COMMUNION BUT IT'S FELLOWSHIP. IT'S RELATIONSHIP WITH YOU IN CHRIST. IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT TAKING THE articles of communion." &gt;&gt; And he says BUT NOW TODAY HE SAYS AND HE AND HE GOES ON HE HE HE STARTS TALKING ABOUT HOW THAT HIS SPIRIT IS TROUBLED over the age that he is seeing and he feels VERY MOVED. UH BY THE SPIRIT OF GOD. AND HE SAYS, "NOW TODAY I WANT TO COME AND I WANT TO TAKE MY time and I want TO BEGIN TO SHOW YOU BECAUSE THIS IS THIS IS EARLY ' 62. THIS IS UH JUST YOU KNOW A LITTLE MORE THAN A YEAR MAYBE 13 or 14 months at most before the nation has already crossed the judgment. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; 56 WAS IT AS A NATION AND AMERICA WAS THE LAST NATION. AND ALL THE OTHER NATIONS ARE ALREADY UNDER JUDGMENT. IN THE 20TH CENTURY, 1956, THE UNITED STATES CROSSES THE LINE BETWEEN JUDGMENT and mercy. Brother Brandham said, "You'll never bring it back. PUT AN ABRAHAM LINCOLN and a GEORGE WASHINGTON IN EVERY COUNTY AND YOU WON'T TURN IT AROUND." &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; BUT YET NOW THE CHURCH IS STILL, YOU KNOW, LIVING ON A SHADOW OF WHAT IT USED TO BE. BUT IT'S LESS THAN 14 MONTHS, MAYBE 15 MONTHS AT THE MOST BEFORE IT'S ABOUT TO CRUCIFY THE WORD OF GOD THE SECOND TIME AND BE INDICTED BY A PROPHET THAT'S GOING TO PUT CHRIST OUT. HE HE'S GOING TO BE OUTSIDE OF HIS OWN CHURCH FOR THE FIRST TIME in 2,000 years. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; SO MUCH SO THAT THEN THE THE CHURCH BECOMES NO LONGER HIS MOUTHPIECE. AND THEREFORE NOW HE'S GOT A A A MESSAGE IN THE LAND CALLING A BRIDE OUT OF ORGANIZED RELIGION BECAUSE HE'S GOING TO HAVE A MOUTHPIECE. &gt;&gt; HE'S GOING TO HAVE A BRIDE. AND IF THE CHURCH KICKS HIM OUT, HE'LL CALL HIS BRIDE OUT WITH HIM AND SHE'LL COME OUT WITH HIM EVERY TIME. &gt;&gt; AMEN. AND SO HE HE TAKES HIS TEXT OUT OF OVER IN IN HEBREWS, you know, GOD WHO AT SUNDAY times and and you know, AND AND AND TIMES PAST AND SPOKE TO THE um through the prophets AND AND BROTHER BRANDHAM IS BRINGING ON DOWN HOW HE NOW HE'S SPOKEN TO HIS BY HIS SON WHO'S HE'S BEEN MADE HEIR OF ALL THINGS who express image of his person and upholding ALL THE THINGS BY THE WORD OF HIS POWER AND HOW HE'S seated and risen TO THE THRONE. AND THEN HE DOUBLES BACK TO GENESIS 1. LET US MAKE MAN IN OUR IMAGE AFTER OUR LIKENESS AND LET HIM HAVE DOMINION. AND SO NOW HE'S SHOWING THAT CHRIST HAS COME AND HAS BEEN ELEVATED. AND WHAT'S WHAT'S THE GOAL? WHAT'S THE ENDGAME? IS TO TURN EVERYTHING AND GO BACK AND TAKE HIS FAMILY BACK TO WHERE GOD WALKED WITH HIM IN THE COOL OF THE DAY. WHERE HIS FAMILY HAD DOMINION OVER ALL CREATION. &gt;&gt; AMEN. AND THERE WAS NO IMMATURITY IN ADAM, NO DISOBEDIENCE IN ADAM. HE DID ALWAYS THAT WHICH PLEASED THE FATHER. &gt;&gt; THE SECOND ADAM DID THAT. THE FIRST ADAM DID THAT AS WELL. SEE, SO HE HIS HIS WHOLE POINT IS NOW THAT GOD HAS SENT A WORD IN THIS DAY TO RESTORE US BACK to oneness &gt;&gt; where the body of Christ and Christ become Mr. and Mrs. Jesus where she is him. &gt;&gt; It's not literally him. She didn't You didn't die for me. UH YOU I DON'T GET BAPTIZED IN YOUR NAME. &gt;&gt; YOU UNDERSTAND? SO, BUT BUT IT BUT HEBREWS 13:8 GIVES US THE KEY TO THE STATEMENT. SHE IS HIM. THREE WORDS. SHE IS HIM. HEBREWS 13:8 EXPLAINS IT. JESUS CHRIST IS THE SAME YESTERDAY, TODAY, AND FOREVER. SHE'S NOT LITERALLY HIM. SHE'S THE same as him. &gt;&gt; You understand? HE'S THE BEGINNING OF THE CREATION OF GOD. THE BRIDE IS THE CONTINUATION OF THAT SAME CREATION. IT'S JUST EXTRAPOLATION AND IT'S STILL GOING AND IT'S BEEN GOING FOR 2,000 YEARS AND IT'S ABOUT TO BE WRAPPED UP. &gt;&gt; I'M IN THAT NUMBER. ARE YOU IN THAT NUMBER? &gt;&gt; SO, WE HAVE THESE CHALLENGES THAT WE ARE FACING and and and AND THE CHURCH WAS GETTING READY TO CROSS A LINE THAT THEY COULDN'T COME BACK FROM. AND AND BROTHER BRANDHAM SAYS, "I'M I'M VERY MUCH CONCERNED WITH THE TIME THAT WE'RE LIVING IN. I'M VERY," HE SAYS, "VERY, VERY VERY MUCH concerned when I see the things happening. I SEE THEM TAKING PLACE AND THERE'S SOMETHING WITHIN ME that's stirred." AND SO HE HE'S GOING TO BREAK THIS SERMON DOWN, HOW THAT a true believer, YOU KNOW, UH HE'S GOING TO GIVE US THE PATH. HOW DO WE GET BACK TO ONENESS? ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS THAT HE'S GOING TO LAY OUT IS THAT A TRUE BELIEVER WILL NOT COMPROMISE on any word of God. BECAUSE TO DOUBT ONE WORD OF GOD IS TO ACCEPT THE DEVIL'S LIE AND YOU BREAK THE CHAIN. Immediately you BREAK THE CHAIN. AS SOON AS YOU DOUBT GOD'S WORD, THEN YOU BREAK THE CHAIN. AND PEOPLE EVEN EVEN GOD'S FAMILY SOMETIMES GET IN IN A HORRIBLE FIX. WONDER WHY DID GOD LET LET ME GET HERE? GOD IS STANDING THERE GOING, "GET BACK ON THE PATH." &gt;&gt; WHY'D YOU LET ME GET DOWN HERE? I DIDN'T. BUT YOU'RE YOU WALKED OFF THE PATH. NOW GET BACK ON THE PATH. &gt;&gt; WILL YOU HELP ME? I'LL HELP YOU. BUT THIS TIME, STAY ON IT ALREADY. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; SEE? &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; SO, HE GOES ON TO SHOW THAT THE WAY BACK COULD NEVER BE intellectual wisdom. And I REALLY WANT THAT CLEAR TONIGHT. THE WAY BACK, AS BROTHER BRANDHAM WOULD DESCRIBE IT, COULD NEVER be intellectual wisdom, but it had TO BE THROUGH A TOTAL UNCOMPROMISING ADHERENCE to God's word and the indwelling of the Holy Ghost. He makes that so clear in that oneness message to brother Brham. PERFECT ONENESS WAS NOT MERELY mental agreement with the word, &gt;&gt; BUT IT WAS ACTUALLY A SPIRITUAL UNION &gt;&gt; WHERE ALMIGHTY GOD LIVES INSIDE THE PERSON. &gt;&gt; SEE? WELL, AND YOU CAN IMAGINE WHY. BECAUSE WITHOUT THAT, any works you did would just be man-made works. &gt;&gt; See? and and even and AND THEY MIGHT BE NOBLE WORKS BUT EVEN IF NOBLE THEY COULD NOT UH GIVE ETERNAL LIFE BACK TO FALLEN HUMANITY. See friends, REFORMATION WITHOUT REGENERATION IS STILL DEATH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; REFORMATION WE WERE TALKING ABOUT THIS SUNDAY. REFORMATION WITHOUT REGENERATION IS STILL DEATH. &gt;&gt; UNDERSTAND? SO, SO YOU KNOW WHEN WHEN WHEN HE DEFINES ONENESS WITH GOD AS HAVING GOD'S SPIRIT IN you and agreeing with the word and THEN THE THIRD THING THAT WILL BE AN EVIDENCE THAT HIS SPIRIT IS in you and that you agree with the word IS THAT YOU WILL MANIFEST HIS KIND OF POWER HIS KIND OF LIFE. WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT, YOU KNOW, WALKING ON WATER. IF THAT'S IF THAT'S WHAT HE DECIDES FOR YOU, THEN YOU'LL WALK ACROSS THE ENTIRE PACIFIC OCEAN AND BACK. BUT THAT'S NOT IT. BUT DO YOU HAVE POWER TO ALWAYS DO THAT WHICH PLEASES THE FATHER? AND IF THE ENEMY COMES IN, DO YOU HAVE POWER TO CAST HIM OUT? DO YOU OPERATE THE POWER OF LOOSING AND BINDING? I'M HERE TO TELL YOU, WHEN YOU HAVE A LIFE FULL OF THE HOLY GHOST AND YOU LIVE AN ADHERENCE TO EVERY WORD, THEN EVERY DEVIL IS AFRAID OF YOU, NOT THE OTHER WAY AROUND. &gt;&gt; AMEN. AMEN. &gt;&gt; SO JESUS SAID UNTO THEM, "VERILY I SAY TO YOU," THIS IS MATTHEW 19:28, "THAT YE WHICH HAVE FOLLOWED me in the regeneration WHEN THE SON OF MAN." &gt;&gt; YES. CORRECT. SO HE SAYS JESUS SAID, "VERILY I SAY UNTO YOU THAT YE WHICH HAVE FOLLOWED ME in the regeneration when THE SON OF MAN SHALL SIT IN THE THRONE OF HIS GLORY, YE ALSO SHALL SIT UPON 12 THRONES JUDGING THE 12 TRIBES OF ISRAEL." SO TO FOLLOW CHRIST, AND I WANT TO SAY IT LIKE THIS, YOU MUST follow Christ in in the regeneration &gt;&gt; or you're nowhere. YOU'RE NOT EVEN OUT OF THE GATE &gt;&gt; IF YOU HAVEN'T FOLLOWED HIM IN THE REGENERATION. BECAUSE REMEMBER, REFORMATION WITHOUT RE REGENERATION IS STILL DEATH. &gt;&gt; YOU UNDERSTAND? AND SO WHEN WE HAVE FOLLOWED HIM TO FOLLOW CHRIST IN THE REGENERATION without a willingness FOR DAILY TRANSFORMATION BY THE APPLICATION OF THE WORD, IT'S STILL IMMATURITY. AMEN. &gt;&gt; AND PAUL SAID, "I DON'T WANT YOU TO BE like children, immature, tossed about." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; JESUS SAID, "YOU GOT TO HUMBLE YOURSELF. BE LIKE A CHILD IN THAT YOU HUMBLE YOURSELF TO EVERY WORD OF GOD." BECAUSE THIS IS THE REAL RUB. WE HAVE OUR OWN WILL. WE HAVE OUR OWN WAY. AND A LOT OF TIMES THE PARENTS WILL AND THE CHILD'S WILL CONFLICT. &gt;&gt; BUT IF THE CHILD WANTS TO STAY HEALTHY, FED, AND DRY, IT NEEDS TO FOLLOW THE WILL OF THE PARENT. YOU HAVE A HEAVENLY PARENT. &gt;&gt; SEE, SO SO REFORMATION WITHOUT REGENERATION IS STILL DEATH. BUT EVEN IF YOU COME THROUGH THE REGENERATION, BUT IF YOU DO THAT WITHOUT A FIRM COMMITMENT TO A DAILY TRANSFORMATION BY APPLYING THE WORD, WE APPLY THE TOKEN. THAT'S NOT A A WORD SALAD. APPLY the token. THAT MEANS TO BRING SOMETHING IN CONTACT WITH. PARENTS APPLY THE TOKEN TO THEIR HOME. THAT MEANS THE CHILDREN COME INTO CONTACT WITH THE token in their home. &gt;&gt; Amen. See, SO CLAIMING TO HAVE A DESIRE FOR TRANSFORMATION AND I WOULD DARE SAY EVEN TO PRAY AND ASK THE LORD TO GROW YOU, BUT WITHOUT A WILLINGNESS TO ENGAGE IN DAILY WARFARE &gt;&gt; AND TO FIGHT THE GOOD FIGHT OF FAITH. YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE NEVER GOING TO OVERCOME? YOU'RE NEVER GOING TO OVERCOME THAT VULNERABILITY THAT WE TALKED ABOUT a couple of services ago. THAT BEING A HUMAN YOU YOU'RE VULNERABLE BECAUSE YOU HAVE CHOICE &gt;&gt; AND THAT'S A HUMAN VULNERABILITY THAT YOU HAVE TO CONSTANTLY DAILY SURRENDER TO THE HOLY SPIRIT. THIS IS WHY THIS MATERIAL IS SO RELEVANT TO DEMONOLOGY BECAUSE EVERY DEMON OUT OF HELL WHO HE HE CANNOT DECEIVE YOU. SO HE TRIES TO HINDER YOU FROM BECOMING EVERYTHING THAT GOD WANTS YOU TO BE IN HIS WORD BECAUSE AS YOU ARE BECOMING THE WORD THAT'S SOMEDAY GOING TO BRING THE SAINTS OUT OF THE GRAVE. &gt;&gt; SO BROTHER BRANDHAM TAUGHT US AS THE CAPSTONE IS COMING DOWN AND THAT BRIDE AND CHRIST BECOME SO INTO ONE TILL THE GRAVES AND THE DEAD FOR HUNDREDS OF YEARS WILL COME. SEE, SO JUST AS DESIRING THE CHARACTER OF CHRIST, BUT YOU HAVE NO WILLINGNESS TO SUFFER WITH CHRIST, &gt;&gt; that's a non-starter &gt;&gt; with God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You understand? See, NOW LISTEN FRIENDS, THIS KIND OF PREACHING IS, YOU KNOW, I I I JUST WANT TO I JUST WANT TO TELL YOU THAT THIS KIND OF PREACHING AND TEACHING, HOWEVER YOU WANT TO CALL THIS SEVEN-PART SERIES, IT'S VERY PURPOSE- DRIVEN. AND AND THE AND THE PURPOSE, THE BEST WAY I CAN DESCRIBE IT TO YOU IS I'M NOT HERE, FIRST OF ALL, I'M NOT HERE TO MAKE YOU COMFORTABLE. I'M HERE TO CONFRONT I'M HERE TO CONFRONT DEMON SPIRITS. &gt;&gt; That anoint PEOPLE WITH SUPERFICIAL CHRISTIANITY. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; And these things a lot of times live too close to us, too close in our homes, too close in our daily lives. AND I'M NOT HERE SAYING I FOLLOW YOU AROUND AND I SEE IT IN TOO MANY'S LIVES. I LOOK IN THE MIRROR AND I GO, "YOU BOY, YOU'RE YOU GOT TOO MUCH SUPERFICIAL GOING ON HERE. YOU NEED TO HAVE A YOU NEED TO BE MATURE BY HUMBLING YOURSELF LIKE A CHILD." &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; SO, I WANT TO TAKE IT HEAD ON AND and the and the whole reason IS, FRIENDS, IS TO CALL US TO A HIGHER FULLNESS IN THE POWER OF GOD. I WANT TO SEE US OPERATE IN THOSE HEAVENLY ATMOSPHERES. HOW ABOUT YOU? DON'T YOU WANT TO SEE YOUR FAMILIES AND YOUR HOMES AND YOUR CHURCHES AND YOUR CHILDREN? WE WANT TO OPERATE IN THOSE HIGH ATMOSPHERES. &gt;&gt; IT'S A GREAT DESIRE OF MY HEART. SEE, AND SO, YOU KNOW, THIS IS NOT REALLY EVEN WHAT I WOULD CALL TEACHING DOCTRINE, BUT IT'S IT'S MORE DIAGNOSING A SPIRITUAL CONDITION of the age that we live in. &gt;&gt; But God has a prescription and a cure. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; AND SO, IF MY IF MY TONE SOUNDS URGENT, THAT'S ONLY BECAUSE IT IS. YES. &gt;&gt; If it's BEEN URGENT OVER SEVEN INSTALLMENTS, IT'S BECAUSE I FEEL URGENT. YOU KNOW, I I THERE THERE THERE'S A THERE'S A CRISIS OF OF OF doom that is THAT IS GROWING AND IT'S GROWING EXPONENTIALLY. BROTHER MATT SMITH WAS JUST TALKING ABOUT THAT IN THE SUNDAY SCHOOL LAST WEEKEND. YOU KNOW, THAT THAT EVEN AMONG THE CONSERVATIVE CONSERVATIVE conservatism and AND THEY'RE EVEN SAYING THAT IT IT'S WHAT ACTUALLY ELECTED TRUMP. YOU KNOW, JUST LIKE THE VOTE OF THE WOMEN ELECTED JOHN KENNEDY &gt;&gt; ON ON THE DEMOCRATIC LIBERAL SIDE AND NOW THE VOTE OF YOUNG MEN HAVE ELECTED DONALD TRUMP AND IS WHAT PUT HIM WITH ALL THOSE EXTRA MILLIONS AND WHY IT WAS SUCH A LANDSLIDE. HE LIKELY WOULD HAVE WON ANYWAY. BUT BUT BUT IT WAS SUCH A LANDSLIDE THAT IT WAS OVERWHELMING. IT WAS HISTORIC THE AMOUNT HE WON BY AND THE POPULAR VOTE AND THE AND THE AND the and and and the and my goodness the the electoral college and IT WAS IT WAS CONSIDERED A A THROTTLING OF THE OTHER SIDE AND BOTH SIDES OF THE HOUSE OF CONGRESS, HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES AND THE SENATE WON ALL OF THAT. &gt;&gt; And what IS IT? IT'S IT WAS YOUNG MEN FEELING ENTHUSED AND AND NOW THEY'RE ALL Christians and AND AND AS I WAS AS I WAS EXPLAINING LAST TIME, I DON'T WANT TO GO DOWN THIS THIS KIND OF A PATH AGAIN. WE'VE COVERED IT BEFORE, BUT IT'S JUST ALL SUPERFICIAL BECAUSE THEY GLORIFY GOD IN ONE MINUTE AND WITHIN 30 SECONDS THEY'RE DROPPING SWEAR WORDS. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; And they they they AND YOU CAN SEE THAT THEY HAVE NO COMPULSION AT ALL TO NOT DO THAT. IT'S AS NATURAL AS BREATHING. &gt;&gt; THAT AND THAT IS SUPERFICIAL. THAT'S THE DECEPTION THAT SATAN HAS SWN OVER THE WORLD. &gt;&gt; SEE, AND AND THE THING ABOUT IT IS FRIENDS THAT THAT THAT THAT THE PIED PIPER IS IS GATHERING THEM ALONG WITH THE UNWISE VIRGIN WHO ARE SEEKING THE OIL. AND AND THAT'S WHY YOU SEE A LOT OF SOMETIMES THINGS THAT LOOK LIKE REVIVAL. THAT FOOLISH VIRGIN ARE SEEKING THE OIL &gt;&gt; AND THE REST OF THE WORLD IS GETTING CAUGHT UP IN THAT HYSTERIA AND THEY'RE ALL CHRISTIANS AND IT'S ALL IT'S THEY'RE NOT CHRISTIANS. &gt;&gt; CHRISTIAN MEANS TO BE CHRISTLIKE. &gt;&gt; SEE, AND SO IT'S A IT'S APPROACHING AN INFLECTION POINT UH TO A PERMANENT TRANSITION THAT HUMANITY IS NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO COME BACK FROM. THEY'VE GOT A LITTLE BIT OF AN OPPORTUNITY WHILE THE BRIDE IS STILL HERE. OH, HOW WE OUGHT TO BE ON FIRE IN THE ATMOSPHERES OF GOD. HOW WE OUGHT TO BE HAVE A LIFE WORTHY OF THE GOSPEL. YOU'RE THE LAST VOICE. YOU'RE THE LAST HOPE. ONCE IT CROSSES THAT LAST INFLECTION POINT AND THE BRIDE LEAVES, THERE'S NO MORE MERCY FOR THE WORLD. &gt;&gt; AND IT PLUNGES HEADLONG INTO A TRIBULATION PERIOD. &gt;&gt; My many inflection points in prophecy have already been crossed. And you KNOW TH THIS AS I CALLED IT SUNDAY THIS SYNTHETIC IMPERSONATION OF CHRISTIANITY. It's a trap. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's a trap according as I said to you Sunday. If the book of revelation is to be believed &gt;&gt; now if you don't okay but if the book of revelation is to be believed it's a trap that will lead them to the mark of the beast &gt;&gt; and destruction in the tribulation sadly. And I say that sadly. Oh, why were we we are still here and they still have a chance. Oh, friends, I I feel like I want to say with Paul, I I must I must not cease to warn every man. &gt;&gt; With urgency, thank God for the revealed word of the hour. &gt;&gt; Thank God for spiritual eyesight &gt;&gt; that we're able to overcome. say, "I DON'T ALWAYS FEEL LIKE MUCH OF AN OVERCOMER." THE ONLY OVERCOMING THAT GOD IS LOOKING FOR YOU to overcome is to overcome the deception to the age. &gt;&gt; YOU UNDERSTAND? JESUS ALREADY OVERCAME ON BEHALF OF your life. &gt;&gt; YOU GET HIM INSIDE YOU AND THEN YOU GET FULLY CREDIT FOR ALL OF HIS LIFE. I'M HERE TO OVERCOME THE LIE. I'M HERE TO OVERCOME THE DECEPTION OF THE AGE THAT'S TAKING THE AGE WITH IT. NO WONDER I SAY THANK GOD FOR EYES TO SEE. &gt;&gt; SEE, not only NOT ONLY, YOU KNOW, UH THE BELIEVER MUST YIELD TO GOD'S VISION FOR THEIR FOR THEIR LIFE, YOU KNOW, UH BUT BUT I I DON'T WANT TO BE I'M GLAD FOR HEARING, BUT I DON'T WANT TO BE A HEARER ONLY AND NOT A DOER &gt;&gt; of the word of God. &gt;&gt; See, SO I'M GLAD FOR WHAT GOD HAS DONE IN OUR LIVES. THE BAPTISM OF THE HOLY Ghost is what GIVES US THE CAPACITY TO be this. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; BUT BROTHER BRANDHAM COMES BACK TO IT AGAIN AND AGAIN. He won't do it all for you. He's not going to push you through a pipe. &gt;&gt; See, the believer must yield to God's vision for their lives. I'm going say that again. The real believer like a child must humble themselves and must yield to the vision God has &gt;&gt; for their life. See, we are participants. Do you believe that? &gt;&gt; It's all for the perfecting of the saints. We read it in our text. It's for THE WORK OF THE MINISTRY. IT'S FOR THE EDIFYING OF THE BODY OF CHRIST. WHY? WHY? WHY? WHY DOES WHY DOES PAUL SAY THAT? THAT WE HENCEFORTH BE NO MORE CHILDREN TOSSED TO AND FRO. I'D SAY THAT'S A PRETTY GOOD REASON. &gt;&gt; SEE, SPEAKING THE TRUTH IN LOVE, WE MAY GROW UP INTO HIM. GROW UP INTO HIM IN ALL THINGS. AGAIN, HE'S ALREADY TALKING TO BORN AGAIN PEOPLE &gt;&gt; WHO AND HE'S SAYING TO THEM, I WANT YOU TO GROW UP INTO HIM IN ALL THINGS. THE BODY OF CHRIST. SEE, IT'S THE BODY OF CHRIST AND AND THEREFORE IT'S YOUR BODY. SO, THE BODY OF CHRIST GLOBALLY, BUT YOUR BODY YOUR BODY PHYSICALLY FITLY JOINED TOGETHER AND COMPACTED FOR WHAT? FOR WHAT? WHY? WHAT? WHY AM WHAT'S MY BODY? WHY DOES HE NEED MY BODY? FOR THE EFFECTUAL WORKING OF THE MEASURE OF EVERY PART MAKETH INCREASE OF THE BODY UNTO THE EDIFYING OF ITSELF IN LOVE. &gt;&gt; THIS IS HOW THE GOSPEL ROLLS. THIS IS HOW HE ACCOMPLISHES HIS PLAN. In love. Not love for the world but for the word and for one another. So, so when we're covering these kinds of things where, you know, you've heard it called, you know, nuts and bolts preaching, you've heard it called where the rubber meets the road. And I I THINK THAT'S PROBABLY FAIR OF THE KIND OF SERIES THIS HAS BEEN. BUT I I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT THAT WHEN I'M PREACHING ABOUT OUR LIVES AND WHERE WE LIVE, JUST REMEMBER I'M IN IT WITH YOU. YES. AMEN. &gt;&gt; And I'm AND I'M NOT I'M NOT ATTACKING PEOPLE. AND CAN I SAY, BROTHER BRANDHAM WASN'T ATTACKING PEOPLE. &gt;&gt; HE I'M NOT ATTACKING PEOPLE. HE WASN'T ATTACKING PEOPLE. WE'RE EXPOSING A SYSTEM AND DOCTRINE THAT PRODUCES A COUNTERFEIT COMFORT. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AND PEOPLE BECOME COMFORTABLE &gt;&gt; AND THEIR COUNTERFEIT EXPERIENCE. SO, I'M NOT HERE TO MAKE YOU COMFORTABLE. Is that okay? &gt;&gt; I'm not HERE TO MAKE YOU COMFORTABLE BY TELLING YOU, YOU KNOW, YOU'RE covered if if you believe God sent a prophet. THE DEVIL BELIEVES THAT. YEAH. I'M NOT HERE TO MAKE YOU COMFORTABLE AND AND SAY, "WELL, AS LONG AS YOU believe the teachings." Let me tell you something, FRIENDS. I IF IF THIS MAKES YOU UNCOMFORTABLE, I GOT TO SAY IT ANYWAY. YOU NEED TO KNOW THAT NOTHING SHORT OF A PERSONAL EXPERIENCE WITH THE LORD JESUS CHRIST. WELL, IF YOU DON'T GET THAT, THEN YOU'LL GO TO YOU'LL TRY TO SERVE GOD AND IT WON'T BE VERY FAR. YOU'LL BE BROKEN. YOU'LL BE DISILLUSIONED AND YOU'LL BE WALKING AWAY WONDERING WHY GOD DOESN'T LOVE YOU. &gt;&gt; AMEN, BROTHER. That's true. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. Oh yeah. &gt;&gt; Satan will eventually you're in church and you love God and you believe the word and you know what God did in this day. But I'm here to tell you, it's got to start with an experience with Christ. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Otherwise, Satan will eventually put together. You hear me? I was once was young and now I'm older. &gt;&gt; I can hear to TELL YOU THAT SATAN WILL EVENTUALLY PUT TOGETHER the right combination. He's just trying to get the right get you IN THE RIGHT SPOT AT the right time. PUT TOGETHER THE RIGHT COMBINATION OF TEMPTATIONS, TRIALS, AND TRAGEDIES, AND HE'LL TAKE YOU RIGHT OUT of the game. &gt;&gt; Amen. So my direct aim has been to emphasize over and over the necessity OF BOTH THE SPIRIT BAPTISM and disciplined thoughts and plans towards God's word. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yeah, &gt;&gt; I'm teaching you to refuse the false choice &gt;&gt; between curtain A, just get the Holy Ghost and everything will fix itself OR CURTAIN B, JUST TRAIN YOUR MIND AND YOU'LL SOMEHOW OVERCOME. THERE IS SOME TRUTH IN BOTH OF THOSE THINGS, BUT BY THEMSELVES, THAT'S NOT THE FULL PLAN OF GOD. YOU MUST BE BORN AGAIN BY THE BAPTISM OF THE HOLY GHOST. AND THEN THAT OPENS UP YOUR CAPACITY TO BELIEVE EVERY WORD OF GOD AND TO APPLY THE TOKEN IN YOUR DAILY LIFE. LISTEN FRIENDS, THE RAPTURE IS NOT A LAYAWAY PLAN. IT'S NOT EASY, REYNOLDS. IT'S THE SAME THING THAT ENOCH HAD. AND ONE DAY YOU'RE JUST WALKING AND THE RAPTURE IS THE SHORT STEP THAT HAS YOU A LITTLE HIGHER THAN YOU WERE THE DAY BEFORE. AMEN. &gt;&gt; THAT'S HOW ENOCH WENT IN A RAPTURE. &gt;&gt; ONE DAY HE STEPPED A LITTLE HIGHER THAN HE HAD THE DAY BEFORE. &gt;&gt; SEE, &gt;&gt; SO IT TAKES A SPIRITFILLED EXPERIENCE in your heart. &gt;&gt; And a determination in your mind TO BRING YOUR UNCONVERTED FLESH SUBJECT TO every word that's balanced. That's biblical and it's desperately needed in our ranks. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; THE SCRIPTURE DOES NOT TELL US in vain to cast down vain imaginations. &gt;&gt; Amen. PAUL DID NOT TELL THE PHILIPPIAN CHURCH, YOU KNOW, HE HE WASN'T VAGUE WHEN HE SAID, "WHATSOEVER THINGS ARE TRUE, WHATSOEVER THINGS ARE HONEST TO BELIEVERS, WHATSOEVER THINGS ARE JUST TO BORN AGAIN PEOPLE, WHATSOEVER THINGS ARE PURE, WHATSOEVER THINGS ARE LOVELY, WHATSOEVER THINGS ARE OF A GOOD REPORT, IF THERE BE ANY VIRTUE, IF THERE BE ANY PRAISE, THINK ON THESE THINGS." &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. SOLOMON DOES NOT MINCE WORDS IN PROVERBS 4. UH BRAD, GIVE ME PROVERBS 4:23-27. Let me give YOU SOME OLD TESTAMENT GOSPEL. Is that all right? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; SOLOMON BEING VERY CLEAR, PROVERBS 4:23 through 27, KEEP THY HEART WITH ALL DILIGENCE, for out of it ARE THE ISSUES OF LIFE. PUT AWAY FROM THEE A FRO MOUTH, AND PERVERSE LIPS PUT FAR FROM THEE. LET THINE EYES LOOK RIGHT ON, AND LET THINE EYELIDS LOOK STRAIGHT BEFORE THEE. PONDER THE PATH OF THY FEET, AND LET ALL THY WAYS BE ESTABLISHED. TURN NOT TO THE RIGHT HAND, OR TO THE LEFT. REMOVE THY FOOT from evil. &gt;&gt; That's not a word salad. &gt;&gt; That's not a word play. That's that's part of the gospel of the Old Testament. I &gt;&gt; WANT TO TELL YOU SOMETHING, FRIENDS. IT'S JUST AS MUCH A PART, YOU KNOW, IT'S JUST AS MUCH A PART OF ALLOWING THE MIND OF CHRIST IN THE OLD TESTAMENT AS IT is in the New Testament. &gt;&gt; IT'S JUST AS MUCH A PART OF ALLOWING THE MIND WHICH WAS IN CHRIST JESUS, WHETHER IT'S IN THE OLD TESTAMENT, SOLOMON IS PREACHING IT, WHETHER IT'S IN THE NEW TESTAMENT, PAUL IS PREACHING IT. YES. &gt;&gt; SEE, WHETHER IT'S THE OLD TESTAMENT BRIDE OR THE NEW TESTAMENT BRIDE, SHE HAS ALWAYS NEEDED TO LET THE WORD OF GOD DWELL IN HER RICHLY. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; SEE, the Holy Spirit is aware that your human desires &gt;&gt; are not always aligned with what God wants for you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. He's aware of that. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; It's why the Bible says, "Lord, remember we are but dust." &gt;&gt; Sometimes I've just had to fall on my knees and say, "Lord, just remember I'm dust. I'm so sorry. Just don't forget I'm just dust." Yes. &gt;&gt; See, &gt;&gt; he's very much aware that our human desires are not always aligned with, you see, WE'RE NOT WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT THE DESIRE in your soul cuz that's for God's word when you're born again by the spirit of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And that's a definite experience. &gt;&gt; BUT NOW YOUR FLESH IS STILL UNCONVERTED. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; And it's GOT TO BE BROUGHT DAILY. THAT'S THE ONE THAT HAS TO CAST DOWN VAIN IMAGINATIONS. THAT'S THE ONE THAT HAS to let the word of God dwell richly. THAT'S THE ONE WHO HAS TO CLAIM EVERY WORD AND APPLY THE TOKEN CONSTANTLY. SEE, THAT'S THE ONE WHO HAS TO TURN HIS FEET AWAY FROM EVIL. YOU KNOW, GOD UNDERSTANDS THAT SOMETIMES OUR FLESH IS NOT ALIGNED WITH WHAT HE WANTS. I MEAN, WE TALK ABOUT IT. WE TALK ABOUT IT ALL THE TIME. HOW OFTEN, YOU KNOW, THE THE LORD DOESN'T LET US HE DOESN'T LET US KNOW WHAT'S DOWN THE PATH. BECAUSE IF WE KNEW AHEAD OF TIME WHAT'S DOWN THE PATH, WE PROBABLY WOULDN'T GO DOWN THE PATH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; So Jesus instructs us to become his little children willing to be led by our heavenly parent in everything. Amen. &gt;&gt; Not just children, but little children. The ones who who will sit where the parent sits them and turn be willing to be turned any way the parent wants to turn them. Very little children don't resist. They really don't know to resist for a while. BUT BUT SEE, WE'RE NOT babes in Christ, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; We're not baby. I MEAN, IF YOU IF YOU WERE IF YOU EVER GET AROUND A PERSON WHO COMES OUT OF THE WORLD AND THEY'RE JUST A BRAND NEW BRAND NEW SPANKING BABY BOY, brand new born again, it don't even matter. YOU COULD TELL THEM YOU HAVE TO JUMP OFF THE ROOF TO GO TO HEAVEN. THEY'D GO JUMP off the roof. THEY ARE WILLING. THEY'RE SO THEY'RE THEY'RE SO HAPPY TO BE CLEAN. THEY'RE SO HAPPY TO BE SAVED. THEY'RE JUST READY TO DO ANYTHING. THEY WANT TO BE AT CHURCH EVERY SERVICE. THEY SIT RIGHT UP ON THE FRONT ROW, YOU CAN'T PREACH IT HARD ENOUGH FOR THEM. AMEN. &gt;&gt; BUT WE DON'T STAY BABES IN CHRIST. WE GROW AND WE BEGIN TO REALIZE, YOU KNOW, I STILL DO HAVE A will &gt;&gt; and I still do have some plans. &gt;&gt; We're grown adults who have to humble ourselves. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And this is where we must get to. I just want to say this to you friends. This is really the the summation of the whole burden of on my heart tonight. come back on here and take this seventh installment on a Wednesday night. And I'm so glad it's a Wednesday night because I wanted to follow Sunday and and a lot of times Wednesdays you can just come and and there's just an atmosphere, simple faith, simple people who love God simply and they want his word. &gt;&gt; A lot of times you you can you can tell who your most spiritual people are because they'll be at church on Wednesdays. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. I'm not attacking. I'm I'm fighting against superficiality. &gt;&gt; I ALREADY ACKNOWLEDGED YOU'RE BORN AGAIN. WHAT DO YOU WANT? I'M TELLING YOU, YOU GOT TO GROW. SEE, YOU'VE GOT TO THROW OFF THE SUPERFICIALITY. UH THAT THAT LISTEN, IT'S A PLAGUE. IT'S IN THE ATMOSPHERE. IT'S OVER THE WHOLE WORLD. &gt;&gt; I DON'T WANT TO BE A PART OF THAT. I WANT TO LIVE IN THOSE HEAVENLY ATMOSPHERES. I WANT TO BE ON FIRE FOR ALMIGHTY GOD. I WANT TO KNOW THAT THE POWER OF GOD AND THERE'S NO HINDRANCE THAT IT CAN FLOW THROUGH ME. I WANT TO SEE IT FLOW THROUGH YOU. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; I hope this weekend, Sunday, I, you know, every year at the beginning of a new year, I kind of give, you know, what I've traditionally called my quote unquote state of the union address. you know, where we are as a church, what is our vision, the beginning of a new year, and and some things that I'm preparing that I want to open my heart up to you as an assembly. But but this is where we must get to if WE'RE GOING TO SUCCESSFULLY NAVIGATE. &gt;&gt; And do you want to &gt;&gt; we're going to navigate and we're going to operate IN THE KINGDOM OF GOD AS USEFUL. I WANT TO BE a useful grown child. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; A child of God who who who has put on the armor and is ready to serve at the pleasure of the king. How many are ready to serve at the pleasure of the king? I want to tell you something friends. The Lord wants us to be wise and he wants us to be cunning and instructed and mature AND AND IN FACT, YOU KNOW, WHEN WE ARE I I JUST WILL SAY TO YOU AND THIS AND I'VE LEARNED THIS BY EXPERIENCE and I I you know, I I I I DON'T WANT TO MAKE MYSELF SOMETHING ABOVE YOU. WE'RE all in this thing together. I SAY THAT all the time. But I'm I'm HERE TO TELL YOU THAT THAT THAT THIS IS WHEN WE ARE THE MOST USEFUL to him. UM YOU KNOW WHEN WE CAN BE SPIRITUALLY MATURE BY HUMBLING OURSELVES AS A LITTLE CHILD. &gt;&gt; YES. AMEN. AND THEN YOU'LL HAVE, BROTHER BRANDHAM SAID, THEN YOU'LL HAVE MORE POWER than the man that RUNS ALL OVER THE BUILDING AND MAKES A BIG BUNCH OF noise &gt;&gt; because you have learned to conquer yourself. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The edifying of itself &gt;&gt; in love. Brother Brandham says finally in oneness 1962, here we are in the end time coming from the east and west, north and south. What are we doing? We're getting ready for a rapture. &gt;&gt; Amen. M getting ready for holding ourselves steady for a few minutes till every fiber is filled with the Holy Ghost. Then she'll go up. &gt;&gt; Oh my. Calling his people together to himself into in the true oneness with himself because it's his one Holy Spirit. By one spirit we are all individually baptized into one body collectively. The body of Jesus Christ. And Jesus Christ living with his spirit in our flesh is serving the church and doing the same things he did as a as an end sign to the world and that we're in the last days getting ready for rapture. &gt;&gt; Amen. So it comes down to this, friends. God's goal is to restore us back to oneness. &gt;&gt; God's goal is to see us living in this last day, this impossible day. What he's asked of us is quite impossible if it were not for his Holy Spirit &gt;&gt; ready, willing, and able to live through you and me. &gt;&gt; Why is this demonology? because every evil spirit is will tell you the exact opposite of what you've heard tonight and heard across these seven installments. I'm here to tell you we're pressing towards something, friend. I'm pressing toward a mark. I'm growing. I'm maturing. I'm gaining ground. I'm gaining speed. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And and you say, "Oh, why aren't you satisfied? I'll be satisfied when I'm on the other side." Hallelujah. Oh, that morning when that morning breaks eternal bright and fair. OH, WHEN THE REDEEMED FRIENDS, WHAT A WHAT AN HOUR THAT IS UPON US NOW. AND IT'S IT'S it's racing to meet US AND THE WORLD FALLING OFF A CLIFF. I'M HERE TO TELL YOU SOMETHING, FRIENDS. I DON'T WANT TO I DON'T WANT TO GET INTO ANY OF my any of my my material in my heart for the weekend. But you you you I just want to I JUST WANT TO BRING YOU UP TO SPEED. The world is is is accelerating toward destruction. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I mean, IT'S IT'S PICKED UP SO MUCH PACE. IT'S IT'S IT'S EXPONENTIALLY FASTER AND AND each and WITH EACH EVEN WITH EVERY 30 DAYS, IT'S JUST DOUBLING AND TRIPLING AND AND AND THE WHOLE WORLD ECONOMY IS ABOUT TO CHANGE AND SHIFT. And they're EVEN NOW EVEN EVEN FINANCIAL ADVISORS ADVISING EVERYBODY GO back to metal, go back to gold because why IT IT IT NEVER BROTHER BRANDHAM DIDN'T TEACH US that the pope controls all the ETFs. &gt;&gt; He controls the gold. &gt;&gt; And Poland and Brazil particularly are are stockpiling both of them Catholic nations. &gt;&gt; Stockpiling gold. He controls the wealth of the world. I'll tell you something. the the you know the the enemies of the beast are learning very quickly that they can't resist him. He's got too much power already. Oh, I just say come quickly, Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; Oh, listen friends. Whatever is left of our life here, I want to I want to be running full steam. I don't want to slow down. I don't want to miss out on opportunities. I want to be at I want to be at full throttle on that morning. Hallelujah. How about you? Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's stand. God bless you. Now, as far as I know, that series is concluded. Amen. Blessed be the name of the Lord. Come on, musicians. Amen. And let's uh take up some prayer requests. I only had the one I saw was uh from Brother Mark uh Carter him and Sister Tabby. Uh we're not doing so good tonight. Maybe like a setback of the flu or the cold that they had had. And that can happen. And a lot of times that's worse when that happens. you're actually more sick than you were uh prior. Amen. So, we're going to put them on the prayer request list tonight. If you have any other prayer requests, you get it to me. I didn't really get any other ones today. Um I had a request from Brother Bruce Paris to be praying for members of his family. And um and so I saw the one for brother Marcus Tabatha. And so I know that there's other ones and and we want to be praying for the saints up in North Carolina and above up through Virginia. that ice storm is supposed to uh head up in that direction. And so I want you to be praying for Sister Debbie's family. Amen. Because they'll be it'll go I think it looks like it's gonna go right over the top of them. Amen. Praise the Lord. Let's bow our heads across the building. Master, we thank you, Father, for your love and your kindness and directing us in your word. Lord, this has been a for me personally such a such a gaining of ground, such an enlightenment into the things of God and how I can overcome and how I can be a stronger Christian, how I can how I can survive Satan's Eden at a higher altitude. Oh God, I want to survive it. Not just survive it, I want to excel. I want oh God to be in those upper atmospheres morning, noon and night every everything Lord your VOICE I COULDN'T IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE TO MISS hearing your voice. Grant it Lord we feel many times Lord that it's higher than we can accomplish but I know that you can accomplish it in us. All it takes Lord is a surrender. We heard you. YOU PUT IT RIGHT ON THE YOU PUT IT RIGHT ON THE BRASS TEXT. humble yourselves and become like a little child. Lord, I pray you'll grant it to us tonight. We commit ourselves into your hands as we turn to prayer now. Lord, we ask you to be with us now and come hear our petitions as we begin to turn the order of the service now in Jesus' name.

We have requests for brother Bruce's family, members of his family, James and different ones needing prayer. Um, brother Tony writes in, "Remember my daddy's been feeling pretty um been following um remember my daddy's been following pretty often." I think maybe he means falling.

How we love him. Lord, in his in his aging now, his aging years falling. And Lord, I'm asking for strength for our dear brother George. I'm asking right now, Lord, mend and heal. If any there's any injury, I pray you'll mend him up quickly. Put strength in him. Lord, don't let that happen. Father, that's just a cruel enemy that would do something like that. We're praying for your servant and we're asking for your mercy. Lord, I'm reaching out for brother Bruce's family and members of his family. We were in a discussion today needing prayer. Oh God, you're still the God of the impossible. Move on the scene. I pray for those young men. I pray for brother Mark, Sister Tabitha, Lord, that you'll touch them in body. I pray, Father, for uh brother Anatoli Stell. You woke me up early this morning, Lord. Heard his name go through my mind. began praying for him, Lord, finding out, Father, that he's uh having talked to his son, that he's he's been having some problems and trouble, and you walked me up, Lord. Perhaps it was on my mind, Lord, as I went to bed, but when I woke up, I could just hear his name coming through my mind, and I'm believing that you're going to touch him, Lord God, and that you're going to strengthen him and meet the challenge. Lord, you know all about it. You know the challenges our brother Straov is facing there in Bellarus. Lord, I pray you will help him now. be near him, Father, now tonight, Lord Jesus, this word that is going forth. God, may it be so that in tomorrow and days to come, we'll continue to ponder these things. Help us now, Lord Jesus. We love you. Give us the strength that we need. We sit in this service tonight, Lord, and we heard your word, and it challenges us, Lord, how it challenges us at such a deep level. And I just want to say, Father, I want to raise up both my hands to you and say, Lord God, put strength in us all. Help us, Lord God, to raise up into higher atmospheres, meeting the challenge to be insign to a dark and dying world. May you grant it, Lord. We commit it to you in Jesus' name. Amen. Let's sing it again. Reaching out to you, dear Lord. I'm reaching out to you. I know your arm is not too short and it can reach me too.

We're going to need a mic to uh Anybody got a testimony? Okay, we got several. We're going to grab a microphone real quick. Praise the Lord. Amen. Okay. All right, Sister Mom, come on up here and get this. Amen. And I know, preaching, the battery's almost dead. Okay. All right. I just want to thank the Lord for last week. Y'all all prayed for me. I had two uh heart tests last week. Doctor wouldn't let me out of them. So, I went they all went very well. I have to say it was kind of rough, but I got through it for because of y'all's prayers. Another prayer y'all prayed was for my neighbor Ruth, who is just a blessing to me. on Friday, she had had uh went to the doctor and he sent her word, "Go to the ER right now." She went to the ER. She was scared. I prayed for her. She went to the ER and they kept her for two days, I believe it was. And when she was ready to come out, it was diverticulitis. She's had it before. When she was ready to come out, they thought she had COVID. &gt;&gt; They give her tests and she had the flu. She's my age. She's 85. She come home extremely sick. After y'all prayed for her, that was amazing. She was just almost healed perfectly. &gt;&gt; Wow. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So, that's some prayer. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. Amen. Sister Melissa back there all the way back. There you go. I've been meaning to give this testimony since Christmas, but it just hasn't worked out. Um, y'all have been so faithful to um pray with me about my testing. We did extremely well. Um, so I want to thank God for that. And then over the holidays um I was um going to it was actually right before we were um going to be out for um the Christmas break. I was going to Bluff and I don't drive very often by myself, just to work and that's about it. And um I had went to merge onto 170. And I guess I just really misjudged um maybe didn't accelerate as fast as I should have, but what I thought was plenty of room was not. And how it was not a serious accident. I don't even know. But three trucks was in a two lane road. I don't know. I can't explain it. But God kept me safe and I'm so thankful. And um you know, you get in a hurry, you don't really you're not very careful sometimes. And I was had a lot to do in a short period of time. So I was on the the ladder and um it's just a step ladder, just a small ladder, but I wasn't being as careful as I should. And I missed a step, fell off and not even I mean nothing. I could have, you know, really stove myself up, but God is just faithful in the little things. And I don't want it may sound silly and but I don't want to ever let these things become &gt;&gt; just common. I want him to know I appreciate all that he does. &gt;&gt; Amen, sister. Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It's kind of a praise um and testimony. I just want to thank God for helping us and helping me get through everything. But I'm on the other end of the spectrum now with blood sugar and insulin and and now my numbers are dropping into the 80s and the 70s like where they're supposed to be. And um I thank God for it. I haven't taken insulin in 10 days. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Um so I just need his wisdom on on how to deal with this end of that spectrum. And I just appreciate all y'all's prayers. They mean very much to me. So thank you for praying for me. and I really genuinely appreciate. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; I just want to thank you for the prayers for Sister Pam Kronite. &gt;&gt; Um she came through the surgery. The doctor said everything went well. She was home the next day. The worst part, she was worried because they were going through her throat um to do a spine um three and four I think and the surgery and she was worried about swallowing after and she said there's been no issues. &gt;&gt; Wow. Praise God. &gt;&gt; So she's home and recovering and thanks for your prayers. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. I love it to know God answers prayer. Okay, brother Caleb, we give you the last word right back there. just want to thank the Lord. We were uh going home like it's been like eight weeks ago now, seven weeks, but we were coming home. The kids were not with us and we got and somebody pulled out right in front of us and um ended up totaling our car. Um but everybody was okay. Wasn't really a serious accident, but the insurance totaled it. Um I just want to thank the Lord that the kids weren't with us and that he protected us in that. And then also having to deal with the insurance company. I was just praying cuz I didn't want to have to deal with that and uh so I was just praying that everything would go smooth and it was definitely the Lord. I mean it was a five minute conversation and they were all very very helpful and it was it had to be the Lord. So I just want to thank the Lord for that Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen.
