TRANSCRIPT
========================================
proceeding, but we'll pray first. Father, we come before you, Lord, and we just want to lift our hearts up to you, Lord. Living in living in a such a a dark hour in so many ways. And Lord, where would we be without the prophetic voice you've given to us at this day? Lord, we'd be so confused and lost in the chaos, Lord. But you you sent us a voice, Lord, to make everything clear for us. Keep our focus &gt;&gt; and our understanding of the times correct, Lord, in in such an incredible way, Lord, in a way that none of us could really comprehend or imagine, Lord. And so we we just want to lift our hearts to you. Ask that you would be be with us this morning and we commit ourselves and our time to you in Jesus name. Amen. Very I haven't been able to I tried my best to study. I haven't been able to even come up with uh any particular thought uh that I wanted to look into. And the maybe for some of you, you you've never heard of Charlie Kirk before. And uh that's just been heavy on my heart. &gt;&gt; Ever since that happened. And you know looking at that I certainly don't want to steal anything away from brother Jason but at the same time I couldn't if the Holy Spirit is dealing with you I just how you can't I every I have a thousand notes to pull up that I could do for Sunday school but it's like totally blank and few scriptures have come to my mind. Philippians 1 verse 20. I don't know that we have anybody back there, but we'll go ahead and pull that up. Philippians 1:20 and 21. according to my earnest expectation and my hope that in nothing I shall be ashamed but that with all boldness as always so now also Christ shall be magnified in my body whether it be by life or by death for me to live is Christ and to die is gain &gt;&gt; amen God God has given us such a a a word of of comfort and strength you I I look at all of this and and I again I apologize if people don't know who he is. You probably do by now if if you don't. It's such a horrible evil that is going on in the world today. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And you look at this, you know, we we understand the teaching of the wise and foolish virgin and and and we get that and we understand that we know that God God works and has an eternal purpose both for the wise and the foolish virgin. And so we don't uh denigrate that whatsoever and understanding uh uh properly placing these things according to the scripture. I don't want to take the time to do that. I just want to put that in your mind. Don't think that Jason's wigged out on everybody here. So, um, but, uh, Charlie Kirk with boldness proclaimed the name of Christ and stood for biblical, uh, values, biblical worldview, and he knew that the price could be his life. He spoke of that over and over again. And yet, he did continue to put himself in harm's way. And I mean speak directly to a culture that is so given over to the enemy, to the devil, that they're celebrating his gruesome assassination. And as I look at all of these things, I just say for myself, Lord, let me speak with all boldness. I'm I'm I'll I'll never have a platform like Charlie Kirk, &gt;&gt; but I have I have a platform, which every one of us do. I have a family. I have I have a wife. I have I have daughters. I have people that I fellowship with. And I believe that this is just a a reminder reminder, at least for me, to never compromise, never to feel like, oh, I'm scared to say something because I might get fired. I might get this. I mean, here's a man who's not even has a doesn't even have a revelation of the message of the word for this day. And he's standing boldly in front of people that hated hated and despised him and debating with them and speaking absolutely plainly about the importance of marriage, of family, of homeschooling, of uh such incredible things that he would stand for. And Lord, let me be in such a place that I with all boldness uh that Christ would be magnified in my body, whether it be in life or whether it be in death. And we have to we have to live and think like that as Christians. We don't have a promise of any more time. We don't know we don't know when our time will be called up. We need to realize, you know, we have loved ones we need to speak to plainly, boldly, but with love and compassion in our hearts. You know, I I I think it's so incredible because you hear the different things that people said about about him or he he said, "Do you hate transgender people?" He's like, "How could I hate people that I have such a heart for?" And I hate he hates what's evil. And that's how we need to be. We need to be in that position where we absolutely hate what is evil. We cling to that which is good. Not hate who is evil but hate that which is evil. And we look at this as well in you know in in just in as individuals as we experience this and I think maybe the young young younger people younger generation this might even impact them more greatly because as Christians you're you're trying to shape and form your your worldview as a believer and Charlie Kirk would be a great help to you And I would encourage young people uh to take the time to watch his videos because many of the things he says says lines up exactly with what we believe in the message as far as family and home and etc. I'm not giving a blank statement. You got to use discernment and search everything by what the prophet said. But in general, you know, brother Matt and I have talked about that as well. And it's it's just incredible to see even so that the the reactions from both sides of the political spectrum and sort of moving into an aspect of uh the prophetic in this day. There's a real we understand what is coming, &gt;&gt; right? Is it communism that's going to rule the world? No. And this is what I that this is what I see as so important to remember the message and to remember how this fits into uh prophecy because it isn't a left-wing uh prophecy that brother Brandham brings forward and prevents presents before us that atheists communists are going to take over the world and we would in our minds and that's what many people thought brother Brandham was preaching against if you start to search communism, do that. I encourage you go into the table and search communism, Romanism, communism, Catholic, &gt;&gt; and you'll see what brother Brandham says. This is very important to understand that because there's there is a deception coming that will deceive even message believers &gt;&gt; and they will see a political move happen in this world and they'll say, "This is good. This is fantastic." and we'll say, "Yeah, yeah, it it is." But one word off is death, &gt;&gt; right? And so, Brother Brandham says in the mark of the beast, 1954, "This United States will come to a time that church and state will unite together and Protestant and Catholic will throw their things together to fight communism." and ex exactly playing into the hands of what God said right here. And behold, a greater Solomon is here in 1962. Let me drop this in. I hope my watch don't alarm too quick. But look, listen. The people today are scared to death of communism. Shame on you. Well, what are you scared of communism? I want a theologian, any Bible scholar, to show me where communism will rule the world. I tell you Romanism is going to rule the world according to the Bible. &gt;&gt; So this is so important to understand that we we look at what's happening and if you can if you understand what's happening to the younger generation is there is a huge pendulum swing that's going on. I know that there's many are deceived by the communist things that are going on in college. And I don't want to get into this, but I would just give a great warning. This this young this young man who became an assassin grew up in a Christian home and a Christian family. And what did he do? He got a scholarship to a to a liberal university with what? With within one year he was on Reddit, obsessed with Reddit and he was a liberal and he was losing his mind. This is a short period of time that he was deceived uh from a university. So I give a great warning and unless you have a a perfect leadership from the Lord to do it for a perfect reason. &gt;&gt; My goodness, Christians should think twice, three times, 10 times, 20 times before they ever enter their children into a university. It's a it's a grave grave danger and it's not something to take lightly. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Where was I? Where this when you don't have notes, there's a danger of rabbit trails. going everywhere and then then you get lost. But as as you look at this this communism that's ra I understand that that is a that is something that's happening but it's really not what is the major thing that's happening uh in in western uh the western world regarding worldview and that is that uh gen Z and Gen A in particular are moving very sharply right. uh many of them would even consider Donald Trump to be left-wing would would consider him to not be very conservative or not conservative enough for their tastes. And so as we understand this, we I was speaking with the brothers last weekend in the fellowship hall about this and to see this happen, it was already happening. But do you understand this event the Lord I mean the Lord has a sovereign purpose that he allows in everything. The word is going to come to pass. This is like a throwing gasoline on a fire that was already burning. &gt;&gt; And I think you'll see in the the coming weeks, months, and next few years this this shift hard right towards Catholicism and and mainline traditional Protestantism. This will increase 100,000 m even just this event. You see things pour absolutely pouring in and people saying, "I'm going to church now. I've been on the fence. I'm going to church. I bought a Bible. I'm doing this. I'm doing that. It It is causing a huge firestorm." And who could argue that's it? Oh, that's horrible. Goodness. No, obviously not. None of us as believers should stand up and say it's horrible, but we should issue a warning and say there's a direction. It's the great that rides upon the beast. And the great is not red China or communism. It's not red, it's purple. &gt;&gt; It's scarlet and purple. Two two colors together. And so it's that's who ride who rides the beast. That's who's pulling uh pulling the levers behind the scenes with everything. And if you if you could see that and understand it's the it's the Roman Catholic Church behind the scenes controlling the beast order. And you know we all of these things are always here in part but then will come in fullness as time goes on. We have them. We all have all these things here. We have spiritually speaking the mark of the beast is already in place. Amen. &gt;&gt; We have all these things, but then it will come to a place where it will actually be a boycott. Thank God we'll the bride will be raptured and gone &gt;&gt; after that. But with all that said, if we can understand and and and and grasp the importance and the significance of the current events, you know, 20 years ago, every everybody thought, well, maybe uh the liberals are the ones that are going to bring in the mark of the beast and we got Clinton and we got Obama and we got all this anti- absolutely is antichrist, but it's at its core it's communist and it's not what we're supposed to fear in in many ways if we can if we can put it all together that communism was just the scarecrow to cause everybody to respond. &gt;&gt; And when I say communism, I mean the left. &gt;&gt; The left is headlong into communism. And their purpose and their plan is is is they want to they want to bring forth communism. They they're sincere about that. But the devil is just laughing at everyone &gt;&gt; because it's he simply is eliciting a natural response. &gt;&gt; You know, for young people, they they want they want to be they want to be on the edge. They they want to be moving towards something. How can you be on the edge and moving towards something with modern society like this today? Means go back to traditional values. It means become a Catholic. go into and and look, you look at all of this. The world has gotten so dark and so evil that we as message believers see Catholics and say, "Oh, I'd rather have them be that than anything else." Okay. Well, yes. No. &gt;&gt; No. Because that doesn't that's death. &gt;&gt; We get to the core reality. Just because you share some basic values, how can two walk together lest they be agreed? I think the value of brother Brandham's message is becoming clearer and clearer and clearer to Bible believers because he's preaching this over and over again and you're going, "What in the world?" I mean, we got we got other problems, Brother Brandham. We got Bill Clinton and Obama and all this stuff going on and it's it's we're missing. &gt;&gt; Yeah. And Christians are are being deceived by it and pulled aside. And again, as I said, I don't say I don't say it's a bad thing that people are buying their Bibles. And I believe even many of them will become part of that remnant, part of that foolish virgin. No, no doubt about that. And they'll decide at the at the last second, I can't take this thing. I can't take They'll be hunted down by like dogs. And yet as we look at the whole picture, we have to understand that there is that out of this is a great deception. &gt;&gt; And I think we learned we learned not to trust our news media. If you didn't know that before when CO struck and you still don't know it, I don't know if you ever will. uh but co was something that revealed many secrets &gt;&gt; and brought to light many many lies uh from that are going forth all around the world. And so when we look at what's what's happening understand is we're not being told the whole story. Uh this is a this is as much as we like to say I like what Trump is doing. I like what this is doing. We have we have to step back and see it from the realm of prophetic. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I don't I don't begrudge any of any of those things and and the the the uh the the things that have been done to move against perversion and wickedness. That's that's wonderful. I think I think what's been done to move away from perversion and wickedness is good. Only the problem is is what's the motive and objective behind it? what's the heart behind it? And I think the same thing for us as we look at just kind of want to transition away from those thoughts. Um, as we look at this and we see what what happened with Charlie Kirk and I think everybody feels like I got to do something. I got to stand up. I got to get active politically. I got to I've got to do something. And I think if if we really look at it in any circumstance, in any situation, whatever happens, the thing is for us to really come down to this and that we want to live according to the word. &gt;&gt; If there's anything in your life that's not right with the Lord, now is the time to realize you could you could you you might not make it out of this church. &gt;&gt; We you know, anything can happen in this evil society. We don't like to think like that but the reality is let's get rid of the evil things in our lives and ultimately this what comes down to when things happen in the world God is giving us a message and you know even when a prophet would come and condemn a n whole nation God even then God wasn't saying it's hopeless he's informing them hey things are bad you have to repent you have to turn away from evil. And if you know any of us want to feel like, hey, I want to do something. How about you love your family? Well, &gt;&gt; how about you love your spouse a little deeper? &gt;&gt; And how about you dig in a little deeper and teach your family the word of God? You say, "I haven't built that habit. We haven't done it. It'll be weird." Good. Be weird. &gt;&gt; Lead your family. Love your family well. Love the people around you well. When and and that means many times having to say the unpopular thing, the difficult thing. That coworker who's struggling, have the difficult conversation with them. The coworker that hates you, is giving you a hard time, have the difficult conversation and speak the truth to them with love, with compassion in your heart. And if you're just angry, we all are a little angry about what what has happened. And we're all maybe hurting over what's happened. I am. Understand that the Lord's trying to speak some a message to you through through the anger and through the hurt. And it could be a thousand different messages. But I would I would say beyond anything, live the word. &gt;&gt; Live the word. Speak the word with boldness. As we read before, Paul saying his earnest expectation and his hope that in nothing he would be he would live his life in such a way that in nothing he would be ashamed, &gt;&gt; but that he could have with a clear conscience. He could speak with all all boldness as always. And now also that Christ would be magnified in my body. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Whatever come, whatever might come. I think if you can understand it, the gospel is not come and your life will be better. The gospel is surrender yourself to Christ. &gt;&gt; In one sense, it's true. I came to give you life at that more abundantly. And when you live according to God's principles, that means you can have peace in your heart and you can live and speak with boldness. On the other hand is we have to count the cost of being a disciple of Jesus Christ. If you remember the the different parables that the Lord tells about a king if he comes to attack a city, he would be a fool if he didn't sit down and understand, do I have enough troops? Do I have the capability to do it? No. This guy has way more troops. All right, I'm going to send an emissary to make peace with this person. And he says, you we need to realize and sit down and count the costs of being a disciple of Jesus Christ. It will cost us everything. We must give everything up to him and let him live and operate in our bodies. Amen. And we want him to be I mean how many want Christ to be magnified in your body? &gt;&gt; Amen. I want I want him to be magnified in my body. But then the next part is hey I want to be magnified in my body whether it be in life or whether it's how I die. &gt;&gt; I want the way I die and the way I live both to magnify Christ. Amen. Romans 12 1 I beseech you therefore brethren by the mercies of God that you present your bodies a living sacrifice holy acceptable unto God which is your reasonable service and be not conformed to this world. Amen. So we have to stand against the ways of the world. We have to stand in contradistinction to the ways of the world. He's called us at the very core, we're different. Even a portion of the meaning of the word holiness, to be holy means to be different, means to be other, means to be separated. We're not to be like the world. We're not to try to find a way to be as close to the world as we possibly can. &gt;&gt; No, we're not to be conformed, but we're to be transformed by the renewing of your mind. &gt;&gt; Amen. So it starts in the mind. The renewing of your life and how you live and how you how you act starts with what's in your mind. What you're feeding your mind, what you're believing and what you're receiving into your mind. That is that is what will be the transforming place. Amen. And that's where the greatest battle ever fought is. that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God. For I say through the grace given unto me to every man that is among you, not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think, but to think soberly, according as God hath dealt to every man the measure of faith. For as we have many members in one body, and all members have not the same office, so we being many are one body in Christ, and everyone members one of another, having then gifts differing according to the grace that is given to us, whether prophecy, let us prophesy according to the proportion of faith. Or ministry, let us wait on our ministering. Or he that teacheth on teaching, or he that exhortth on exhortation. He that giveth, let him do it with simplicity. He that ruleth with diligence. He that showeth mercy with cheerfulness. Amen. We all have a different calling and in a different place &gt;&gt; and a different position in the body. But it all requires a full surrender to Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's not saying the preachers have to have more of a surrender and the drum drum drummer has to have a less surrender. That's not each one of us has a ministry and a gift that we need to operate and we need to fully surrender our hearts and minds to the Lord so that we can operate with boldness. And then beyond that, not just in the body, but also in our own family. Each one of us has a different place and a pos different position. Some are older siblings, some are younger siblings, some are middle siblings. There's different position and place and there's a different interaction that will take place in there. But the Lord wants you to be all that you can be for the building up of the family. It's not just dad's place to build up the family or mom's place to build up for the family. It's also the children's place if they if if they understand it right. They have gifts. They've been made in such a way that they can bless and build up the family. And it's even our job as fathers to see that and bring that out of them. And so I think if we look at what's happened recently, I think it can be just a if you can for me personally, I feel like it's a call to to realize how important my duty as a Christian is. Not just as a preacher.
