[10:48] god bless you all this morning i have a
[10:50] little announcement to make we've had
[10:52] some uh
[10:53] work done on the
[10:55] irrigation of the pine straw beds
[10:57] outside
[10:59] so the little ones we want to keep from
[11:00] running through it and the big ones too
[11:04] you want to stay on the walk path
[11:07] irrigation is a little fragile so if you
[11:09] step on it or something it won't work
[11:11] properly so
[11:13] your parents want to re-emphasize that
[11:15] to your children as you see them out
[11:17] there and stuff to keep them out of the
[11:18] flower beds and stuff
[11:21] amen
[11:22] now that sunday school lesson
[11:25] i can't
[11:26] imagine with all the prophecies that are
[11:29] being fulfilled today
[11:32] to be slack or
[11:34] numb
[11:35] to where we are today
[11:37] we are so close to just
[11:40] passing over and that's where my focus i
[11:43] want to be you know i i see people in
[11:45] the world and i'm just like
[11:47] how do they keep going and they don't
[11:49] they
[11:50] do this you know the
[11:51] the last horse rider was death
[11:54] and anytime you read the news what do
[11:56] you see people are dying left and right
[11:59] you got 15 year old kids killing parents
[12:02] and you got parents killing kids and
[12:04] you know they find bodies here and they
[12:06] find bodies here that have been missing
[12:08] for
[12:08] six months a year
[12:10] and it's just you know in the natural is
[12:12] typing the spiritual
[12:14] amen so we want to be
[12:16] aware

[12:20] other term but we want to be awakened to
[12:23] the hour that we're living in give all
[12:25] that we got

[12:33] for that
[12:35] you know

[12:39] why am i even going to work anymore
[12:42] but you know you got to have a balance
[12:44] you want to keep
[12:46] pressing the mark and you want to be a
[12:48] solid
[12:50] minded christian that people can look at
[12:53] you know if everybody stopped working
[12:55] it's like oh that's a cult that's what
[12:57] they did when brother branham was around
[12:58] they set up a commune and they didn't
[13:00] want to work and they wanted the lord's
[13:02] coming and that was 60 years ago

[41:23] do a follow-up
[41:25] heart cath to make sure everything is
[41:27] working fine i had a very slight symptom
[41:30] that was similar
[41:32] to last year a year ago it was very mild
[41:34] it wasn't anything compared to
[41:37] a year ago
[41:38] but the doctor felt that in an abundance
[41:40] of caution hey
[41:42] you know all my tests always come back
[41:44] normal when they test my heart
[41:46] every test i ever take my heart comes

[41:52] so strong echo is great everything is
[41:54] great
[41:55] uh and none of it detected um that
[41:58] blockage but i had a certain symptom

[54:47] lord to lay aside the the thoughts that
[54:50] are might be nagging us in the cares of

[54:56] minutes
[54:57] on the word we ask these things
[54:59] in jesus name amen
[55:02] god bless you i'm going to speak on the
[55:04] subject of the marriage of the lamb
[55:07] also
[55:09] for those who are
[55:11] volunteering to help
[55:13] with the youth meeting weekend
[55:16] we're going to have a meeting right
[55:17] after service so stay around it'll be
[55:19] brief
[55:20] won't keep you long so
[55:22] all right
[55:25] i had studied this topic before
[55:28] the marriage of the lamb and
[55:30] had some notes but
[55:32] yesterday in the the men's bible study
[55:35] we spoke about the seventh seal and
[55:38] and we're going through some different
[55:39] things and and uh i think it was brother
[55:41] rodney that brought up the
[55:44] the type of the marriage
[55:45] and so and how critical that is i'm
[55:48] looking for the
[55:50] uh
[55:51] the clicker for the
[55:52] i think it's up there they're running it
[55:54] up
[55:56] so we want to go to the first slide
[55:58] there and read the scripture while
[55:59] you're standing we don't want to keep
[56:00] you standing
[56:01] all after
[56:02] all through the afternoon
[56:04] but uh second corinthians 11 2.
[56:08] for i am jealous over you with godly
[56:10] jealousy
[56:12] for i have espoused you to one husband
[56:15] that i may present you
[56:17] as a chaste virgin to christ
[56:24] revelation 9 19
[56:26] 7
[56:27] let us be glad and rejoice
[56:30] and give honor to him for the marriage
[56:32] of the lamb
[56:33] is come and his wife
[56:35] hath made herself ready amen may the
[56:38] lord have the blessing to the reading of
[56:39] his word he can be seated
[56:44] so
[56:47] looking at
[56:49] the seventh seal we were discussing that
[56:52] some yesterday and
[56:54] how that
[56:55] you know many times people they want
[56:57] they want to
[56:58] look at the seventh seal and they begin
[57:00] to study it and they look at what
[57:02] brother branham said
[57:03] in the sermon the seventh seal
[57:06] by itself and they come and say
[57:09] it's not
[57:10] it's not revealed
[57:12] we it's a secret we can't know anything
[57:15] about it okay that's what that's
[57:18] an accurate depiction of what he says
[57:21] in the seventh seal
[57:22] but again we don't stop there
[57:25] the message doesn't end there
[57:28] he continues to pre in case he didn't
[57:30] know that after the seals he continues
[57:31] to preach after that
[57:33] he speaks about that topic he there's
[57:35] there's some quotes we're going to look
[57:37] at
[57:38] but when you look and see
[57:41] in the seventh seal he also gives clues
[57:45] he'll he'll be speaking a certain way a
[57:47] certain way a certain way and then he
[57:48] says but
[57:50] which reminds me of revelation 10 7 but
[57:54] in the days of the voice
[57:55] of the seventh angel the mystery of god
[57:57] should be finished
[57:58] so here's
[58:00] here's ten things when i was
[58:02] studying the seventh seal that i
[58:04] grabbed a hold of three there's a
[58:05] threefold mystery
[58:07] one of the folds is the seven thunders
[58:10] another fold is connected to the coming
[58:12] of the son of man a mystery known only
[58:15] to god
[58:17] then the seven thunders reveals the
[58:19] coming of the son of man
[58:21] six seals have been opened we see it
[58:24] seventh will not
[58:25] be broke to the public until the hour
[58:28] arrives
[58:30] the seventh he says the seventh seal is
[58:32] not completely unfolded
[58:34] all right
[58:36] he says it's it's just unfolded to the
[58:39] seven thunders
[58:42] and again he repeats the seventh seal is
[58:44] not known to the public
[58:48] in matthew 24 he says when he goes
[58:50] through that he left out the seventh
[58:53] seal
[58:54] meaning
[58:55] he said it was a mystery matthew 24 36
[58:59] and 37
[59:00] speaks of no man knows the day or the
[59:03] hour
[59:05] but it but but as it was in the days of
[59:07] noah so shall it be
[59:08] at the coming of the son of man so
[59:10] that's
[59:11] what he's saying the seventh seal is the
[59:13] coming of the son of man
[59:14] then as he finishes all this he says it
[59:17] won't be known and it's not going to be
[59:18] known
[59:19] but
[59:20] it will be revealed
[59:22] in the days of the voice of the seventh
[59:24] angel
[59:26] all right
[59:29] so
[59:30] you know brother branham speaks about
[59:32] this the sec first and second polls
[59:35] he thoroughly explained over and over
[59:37] again right
[59:40] and he wasn't supposed to do that what
[59:42] did it do brother branham said it
[59:43] produced impersonators
[59:46] but
[59:48] to this point in time in his life the
[59:50] lord had taught him and trained him
[59:52] don't do it again don't do it a third
[59:55] time
[59:56] don't thoroughly explain every detail
[59:58] the third time he very carefully spoke
[1:00:02] about the seventh seal and the third
[1:00:03] pole
[1:00:06] and he emphasized
[1:00:08] at the end
[1:00:09] it's not to be known to the public
[1:00:13] he says he says just live
[1:00:17] don't try to interpret it
[1:00:19] just live a godly
[1:00:21] christian
[1:00:22] life don't be fanatical
[1:00:25] i love that it's almost like a sleight
[1:00:27] of hand a little bit that brother
[1:00:29] brother branham is doing he's saying
[1:00:30] don't interpret it
[1:00:32] just live a godly life because living a
[1:00:34] godly life is the interpretation of it
[1:00:40] because then you fast forward
[1:00:42] and we understand okay it's
[1:00:45] it's it's not going to be known to the
[1:00:46] public this is it's a total secret
[1:00:49] okay are we supposed to stay there
[1:00:51] without understanding
[1:00:53] are we supposed to just okay it's a
[1:00:55] total secret mine stop done it'll be
[1:00:57] known sometime in the future
[1:01:01] laodicean church age i think i'm not
[1:01:04] sure if this is working brothers i'm not
[1:01:05] sure if this is the right one
[1:01:07] am i
[1:01:08] is this hiding from me up here
[1:01:11] i know there's a second one
[1:01:13] uh
[1:01:14] maybe this one will work we'll give it a
[1:01:16] shot
[1:01:20] that one don't work and
[1:01:22] that one don't work brother george could
[1:01:23] you help me
[1:01:24] you fixed it before
[1:01:27] go on to the next screen
[1:01:32] yeah
[1:01:35] chapter 9 in the church ages book now
[1:01:38] this messenger of malachi 4
[1:01:40] and revelation 10 7 is going to do two
[1:01:43] things one
[1:01:44] according to malachi 4 he will turn the
[1:01:46] hearts of the children to the fathers 2
[1:01:49] he will reveal the mysteries of the
[1:01:51] seven thunders in revelation 10
[1:01:53] which are the revelations contained in
[1:01:56] the seven seals
[1:01:58] it will be these divinely revealed
[1:02:00] mystery truths that literally turn the
[1:02:03] hearts of the children to the
[1:02:04] pentecostal fathers exactly so
[1:02:07] all right let's
[1:02:08] go back don't don't go to the next
[1:02:10] screen yet
[1:02:11] so this is this is key in understanding
[1:02:14] this
[1:02:15] are the seven thunders what they spoke
[1:02:17] are they is it revealed
[1:02:19] according to this it is
[1:02:23] right so we're not waiting for a future
[1:02:25] revealing of the seven thunders right
[1:02:28] before
[1:02:29] the literal body change takes place
[1:02:32] some people will interpret it that way
[1:02:34] the right before the literal body change
[1:02:36] seven thunders will under their voices
[1:02:38] to bring rapturing faith
[1:02:40] brother branham's message was to bring
[1:02:42] rapturing faith
[1:02:44] the seven thunders
[1:02:46] was to bring rapturing faith they're one
[1:02:48] in the same
[1:02:50] right it's the seventh what the seven
[1:02:53] thunders utter
[1:02:54] actually restores us back to the
[1:02:57] original faith
[1:02:58] so it's not a new revelation it's not
[1:03:01] something outside of scripture but it's
[1:03:02] what is hidden in
[1:03:05] the bible
[1:03:07] the teachings of the apostles
[1:03:09] and the prophets
[1:03:11] there that were
[1:03:12] sealed to our understanding
[1:03:14] throughout the church ages
[1:03:16] then brother branham says when the seals
[1:03:18] open it becomes a new book
[1:03:21] not that it literally becomes a new book
[1:03:23] but that the understanding of what's
[1:03:25] already in the book
[1:03:28] now is made known made plain made clear
[1:03:31] amen
[1:03:33] and so we can't we can't say
[1:03:35] the seventh seal is not
[1:03:37] revealed
[1:03:38] it's not revealed to the public
[1:03:40] absolutely it's a spiritual revelation
[1:03:43] for the bride only
[1:03:45] we can as preachers we can stand and we
[1:03:47] can try to
[1:03:48] [Music]
[1:03:49] uh
[1:03:51] unfold it to you explain it to you
[1:03:53] but at the end of the day it has to be a
[1:03:56] revelation from the holy spirit
[1:03:58] it's you can acquire knowledge
[1:04:02] about this topic
[1:04:04] human knowledge
[1:04:07] and
[1:04:08] it can be the worst thing that could
[1:04:09] happen to you because
[1:04:10] it creates pride
[1:04:13] and at the same time if it's spiritual
[1:04:16] revelation that's bringing knowledge
[1:04:17] because we're supposed to grow in the
[1:04:19] grace
[1:04:20] and the knowledge of the lord jesus
[1:04:23] so our growth in grace and our growth as
[1:04:25] christians is connected to
[1:04:28] knowledge
[1:04:29] but it's not human knowledge
[1:04:32] it's spiritual revelation
[1:04:34] that's what the that's what the bible is
[1:04:36] that's what paul is continually pointing
[1:04:38] to continually talking about
[1:04:40] he prays for the church
[1:04:42] in ephesus and he says i'm praying that
[1:04:44] you would receive a spirit of wisdom and
[1:04:46] revelation
[1:04:48] in what in the knowledge of him
[1:04:51] okay
[1:04:52] don't get it out of order
[1:04:54] people can get it out of order and so
[1:04:56] emphasize
[1:04:57] on the knowledge aspect they divorce
[1:05:00] themselves from it has to be
[1:05:02] a spiritual revelation from god
[1:05:06] otherwise it's no knowledge to speak of
[1:05:08] in the first place it's not knowledge
[1:05:10] that's going to change your life
[1:05:12] but there is hidden
[1:05:14] mystery
[1:05:16] knowledge that we're supposed to have
[1:05:19] that will change our lives but it has to
[1:05:23] come
[1:05:24] by something that god unfolds to you as
[1:05:27] an individual because it's not to be
[1:05:30] known to the public
[1:05:31] but it's to be known and revealed to the
[1:05:33] bride
[1:05:37] so the seven thunders
[1:05:39] it's already revealed we're not waiting
[1:05:41] for more
[1:05:43] um teachings to be made known
[1:05:46] everything that the bride has need of
[1:05:48] has been revealed in brother branham's
[1:05:51] message
[1:05:53] but everything that's revealed it
[1:05:55] revealed in that message is not yet an
[1:05:57] understanding to us
[1:06:00] right and so that's why we're still here
[1:06:02] is god is unfolding himself through
[1:06:04] that message to us
[1:06:07] as individual
[1:06:08] members of the body bride of christ
[1:06:13] that's god's purpose he wants you to
[1:06:15] have a revel i have an understanding
[1:06:18] in in the sermon the paradox if you look
[1:06:19] at the beginning he says
[1:06:22] it's coming to an ephesians again
[1:06:24] and we're going to understand it the
[1:06:26] bride is going to understand it
[1:06:29] so please don't consider
[1:06:31] knowledge
[1:06:32] and understanding as a swear word
[1:06:36] but understand it in its right balance
[1:06:39] it has to be
[1:06:40] holy spirit
[1:06:42] inspired and revealed
[1:06:44] to your heart
[1:06:45] we can study we can get it all figured
[1:06:47] out that's that's meaningless and
[1:06:49] useless
[1:06:50] it has to come by a revelation of the
[1:06:53] holy ghost to you as an individual
[1:06:57] all right so
[1:06:58] it's a secret won't be known to the
[1:07:00] public
[1:07:02] but
[1:07:03] but
[1:07:03] we see this this and then we see the
[1:07:05] next if we go to the next screen
[1:07:07] brothers
[1:07:08] in christ is the mystery of god revealed
[1:07:11] god's
[1:07:12] great mystery of how it's a secret he
[1:07:15] kept it a secret
[1:07:17] nobody knowed nothing about it
[1:07:19] even the angels didn't understand it see
[1:07:22] he didn't reveal it that's the reason
[1:07:23] under our seventh mystery when the
[1:07:25] seventh seal was open there was silence
[1:07:28] jesus when he was on earth they wanted
[1:07:30] to know when he would come he said it's
[1:07:31] not even the son himself don't know when
[1:07:33] it's going to happen see god has this
[1:07:35] all to himself it's a secret
[1:07:37] and that's the reason there was silence
[1:07:39] in heaven for a space of a half hour and
[1:07:42] seven thunders utter their voices
[1:07:44] and john was even forbidden
[1:07:48] to write i think we
[1:07:50] need to go on to the
[1:07:52] next one
[1:07:53] john was even forbidden to write it see
[1:07:55] the coming of the lord
[1:07:56] that's the one thing he hasn't revealed
[1:07:59] yet of how he will come
[1:08:01] and when he will come
[1:08:03] it's a good thing that he doesn't no
[1:08:06] okay so this is interesting what he's
[1:08:08] saying
[1:08:09] the quote doesn't end there though let's
[1:08:10] go to the next screen
[1:08:13] look his next verse it's sim it's so
[1:08:15] similar
[1:08:16] to the seventh seal
[1:08:18] it's not known it's not revealed yet
[1:08:20] it's a good thing he doesn't
[1:08:22] he has showed it he should order
[1:08:24] revealed it in every type that's in the
[1:08:26] bible
[1:08:28] therefore the entire bible is the
[1:08:30] revelation of god's mystery in christ
[1:08:34] the entire bible is an expression of one
[1:08:37] goal that god had one purpose he wanted
[1:08:40] to achieve in the entire bible next
[1:08:42] screen
[1:08:43] and all the acts of the believers in the
[1:08:45] bible has been in type
[1:08:47] and expressing what god's great goal is
[1:08:50] and now in this last day he has revealed
[1:08:54] it and showed it
[1:08:56] okay
[1:08:58] it's a good thing he hasn't revealed it
[1:08:59] next thing he says it's in every type in
[1:09:01] the bible
[1:09:02] and god's great goal and now in the last
[1:09:04] day he reveals it and shows it and god's
[1:09:07] help will see it right here this morning
[1:09:10] what the lord has had in his mind
[1:09:12] all along and it has expressed it
[1:09:15] therefore you can see the great meaning
[1:09:17] of what it's been to know this and then
[1:09:20] to try to bring it to the people see and
[1:09:22] then you don't i haven't went into
[1:09:24] details to try to explain it
[1:09:26] as god has revealed it to me
[1:09:30] again
[1:09:31] similar language to the seventh seal
[1:09:32] it's we don't know it it's a mystery
[1:09:34] good thing he doesn't reveal it and
[1:09:36] we're gonna speak about it and show you
[1:09:37] exactly what it is today
[1:09:42] why is he doing that because he was
[1:09:44] warned
[1:09:46] he was warned let it be a spiritual
[1:09:49] revelation to the people
[1:09:51] don't explain every detail
[1:09:53] let it be that revelation to the people
[1:09:56] now i want you to want to show you
[1:10:00] in the next quote when we're talking
[1:10:03] about
[1:10:04] the coming or the revealing of the son
[1:10:05] of man
[1:10:08] he says jesus said when the son of man
[1:10:11] is revealed from heaven
[1:10:13] let me close by saying this the son of
[1:10:15] man is now being revealed from heaven
[1:10:18] will it come after a while brother
[1:10:19] branham
[1:10:20] it is now
[1:10:22] and i hope i won't have to make this
[1:10:23] purse so personal of this own meeting
[1:10:26] but that your spirit within you that's
[1:10:28] given you by god can read what i'm
[1:10:30] talking about the some son of man has
[1:10:32] already come from glory and is revealing
[1:10:35] himself for the past few years to his
[1:10:36] church in mercy
[1:10:38] showing them his great presence doing
[1:10:40] the same things that he did when he was
[1:10:41] here on earth
[1:10:42] revealing himself like he did to abraham
[1:10:45] before the destruction
[1:10:46] he has come now in mercy revealing
[1:10:49] himself to the church it's being laughed
[1:10:51] at and scoffed at
[1:10:54] so understand the big picture
[1:10:57] don't shut your brain off if you go
[1:10:58] study the seven do study the seventh
[1:11:00] seal but don't shut your brain off your
[1:11:03] mind off your your spiritual
[1:11:05] understanding from the rest of what the
[1:11:08] message says
[1:11:09] because brother branham is speaking in
[1:11:11] careful terms
[1:11:13] to not go into every detail
[1:11:15] but for for those of us who've been
[1:11:17] following the message it should be quite
[1:11:19] obvious what he's talking about the
[1:11:21] seven thunders reveals the coming of the
[1:11:23] son of man
[1:11:25] hmm
[1:11:26] well what does that mean what are this
[1:11:28] what is what what can we break down the
[1:11:30] seventh seal real easy
[1:11:32] it's the message
[1:11:35] it's the message and
[1:11:36] and we're going to talk about
[1:11:38] more about that um more about the second
[1:11:42] aspect of that because it has to not
[1:11:43] just be a message that's out there in
[1:11:45] space
[1:11:46] but it has to be christ becoming one
[1:11:49] with his bride
[1:11:51] and and she
[1:11:53] being him amen
[1:11:57] so understand of course
[1:11:59] this is this quote is from 1958 i don't
[1:12:01] want to muddle things up
[1:12:03] understanding 1963 the mighty angel came
[1:12:06] down in a unique way to open up
[1:12:09] those seals to us to bring us the
[1:12:11] revelation of the word
[1:12:13] so don't don't get confused but of
[1:12:14] course throughout brother branham's
[1:12:16] ministry the son of man was there behind
[1:12:18] that revealing himself through that
[1:12:21] but something distinct and important
[1:12:23] happened in 1963 that was different
[1:12:25] from what happened before that
[1:12:28] that's another topic altogether
[1:12:31] but let's look at that statement brother
[1:12:32] branham makes
[1:12:35] back there let's talk about that all the
[1:12:37] acts of the believers in the bible has
[1:12:39] been in type
[1:12:40] and expressing what god's great goal is
[1:12:45] he says and now in this last day he has
[1:12:47] revealed it
[1:12:49] and shows it
[1:12:51] so the seventh seal
[1:12:53] is shown by every type
[1:12:56] throughout the bible
[1:12:58] so fast forward then christ is the
[1:13:00] mystery of god revealed what verse is
[1:13:03] that from the mystery of god
[1:13:06] revelation 10 7
[1:13:08] so christ is the mystery of god revealed
[1:13:10] but in the days of the voice of the
[1:13:12] seventh angel when he shall begin to
[1:13:13] sound the mystery of god should be
[1:13:16] finished
[1:13:17] as it was revealed to his servants the
[1:13:19] prophets
[1:13:21] so what what what is the threefold
[1:13:23] mystery
[1:13:25] god revealed in fullness in christ
[1:13:28] god
[1:13:29] god revealed in fullness in his bride to
[1:13:32] bring the preeminence
[1:13:35] and the restoration back to the kingdom
[1:13:38] those three things it's a threefold
[1:13:40] purpose so well that's what's god that's
[1:13:42] god's great goal that's what's unfolded
[1:13:45] by the seventh seal
[1:13:48] it's it's so complicated you'll never
[1:13:50] understand it without me explaining it
[1:13:52] to you
[1:13:53] no
[1:13:54] no
[1:13:56] i don't believe god made it that way
[1:13:58] i don't believe god purposed it that way
[1:14:01] amen
[1:14:03] these things are clear
[1:14:06] brother jason has pretty much been
[1:14:07] preaching to us about this for the last
[1:14:09] since i've been here brother jason
[1:14:11] from different every different angle
[1:14:13] it's if we're not if we're not picking
[1:14:15] he's preaching to us the seventh seal
[1:14:17] the third pole the opening of the word
[1:14:19] what the message is
[1:14:23] we don't want it to go over go over our
[1:14:25] heads or not or miss the importance
[1:14:27] of what he's talking about
[1:14:29] this is key
[1:14:34] so one way
[1:14:36] that god reveals himself in type
[1:14:39] through the bible is through marriage
[1:14:41] right
[1:14:42] actually that's one of his most primary
[1:14:45] ways
[1:14:47] you know that's part of the great
[1:14:48] importance of understanding the
[1:14:50] revelation of serpent seed
[1:14:52] is because it's always
[1:14:54] a false life injecting itself
[1:14:58] into
[1:14:59] the place that god is working in to
[1:15:01] bring an adultery amongst the people
[1:15:04] and so that's that's the continual
[1:15:06] process in
[1:15:08] in eve through eve
[1:15:10] through israel through the church
[1:15:13] and he's still trying to do it today
[1:15:16] trying to inject a false seed
[1:15:18] and so when we understand serpent seed
[1:15:20] we can we can grasp this
[1:15:22] because god is trying to be married to
[1:15:24] his people
[1:15:26] and have full and complete
[1:15:29] preeminence in them
[1:15:31] so that when you see them you're seeing
[1:15:33] him
[1:15:34] right he made
[1:15:36] man adam and eve he made man and woman
[1:15:38] to be the image and likeness of god the
[1:15:41] two of them together in unity
[1:15:44] express the invisible god not not each
[1:15:48] of them separate but the two of them
[1:15:49] together in god's economy so christ and
[1:15:52] his bride is a perfect expression of who
[1:15:55] god who the invisible god is
[1:15:59] and so in in the bible we see a lot of
[1:16:01] things written about
[1:16:03] marriage
[1:16:05] and i don't believe it's our british
[1:16:08] marriage customs that have passed over
[1:16:10] to america
[1:16:11] that is the type
[1:16:13] of christ and his bride
[1:16:14] but it's eastern
[1:16:17] traditions of marriage and customs that
[1:16:19] we find in the bible
[1:16:20] and it's made clear from genesis to
[1:16:22] revelation these things are made
[1:16:25] plain before us
[1:16:27] it's incredible
[1:16:29] so i want to start with with the next
[1:16:31] quote that i have up there
[1:16:33] brother travis from proving his word
[1:16:38] he says to join the church to the head
[1:16:40] unite the marriage of the bride
[1:16:42] the bridegroom call will come right
[1:16:44] through this
[1:16:45] when the son of man will come down and
[1:16:48] come in human flesh to unite the two
[1:16:50] together
[1:16:51] the church has to be the word he is the
[1:16:53] word and the two unites together and to
[1:16:56] do that it will take the manifestation
[1:16:58] of the revealing of the son of man
[1:17:01] next one
[1:17:03] not a clergyman i don't i don't know i
[1:17:05] do you see what i mean see it's the son
[1:17:07] of man jesus christ will come down
[1:17:10] in human flesh among us and will make
[1:17:12] his word so real
[1:17:14] that it will unite the church and him as
[1:17:16] one the bride and then she'll go home to
[1:17:19] the wedding supper amen she's already
[1:17:21] united see
[1:17:22] we go to the wedding supper
[1:17:24] not to the marriage
[1:17:26] so what does he tell what is he saying
[1:17:28] there
[1:17:28] he's he's telling us in very simple
[1:17:30] terms the son of man
[1:17:32] has come down
[1:17:35] into
[1:17:36] a body of people a many member bride in
[1:17:39] this hour
[1:17:40] in order to join the two
[1:17:42] together in marriage
[1:17:46] christ and the bride are married
[1:17:48] the marriage of the lamb
[1:17:50] has come
[1:17:52] his wife hath made herself ready
[1:17:54] we're married
[1:17:56] listen to invisible union go go and
[1:17:58] listen to that find out if we're married
[1:18:00] or not
[1:18:02] all right
[1:18:04] so again
[1:18:05] marriage customs are different in every
[1:18:06] culture but if we're gonna see a type in
[1:18:08] the marriage
[1:18:09] custom we're gonna have to see a type in
[1:18:10] the bible
[1:18:13] so first scripture we had up and i think
[1:18:16] it's the next one yeah
[1:18:17] second corinthians 11 2 for i am jealous
[1:18:20] over you
[1:18:21] with godly jealousy for i've espoused
[1:18:23] you
[1:18:24] to one husband that i may present you
[1:18:27] as a chaste virgin to christ
[1:18:30] so paul is saying i've i've you're
[1:18:32] engaged
[1:18:34] i've been a part of the i've been the
[1:18:36] one to communicate
[1:18:38] that there's an engagement going here
[1:18:40] there's a betrothal
[1:18:41] that's taken place
[1:18:43] between
[1:18:44] the church
[1:18:46] and christ he didn't say there's a
[1:18:47] wedding that took place he said there's
[1:18:49] a betrothal there's an engagement
[1:18:52] that's taken place and so let's go to
[1:18:55] the next screen
[1:18:57] and i have
[1:18:58] a number of points come up just go one
[1:19:00] by one as i cover them by the travis
[1:19:02] so here's the process
[1:19:05] and we'll see this in the scripture
[1:19:07] first thing is negotiation between
[1:19:09] families
[1:19:10] where the father of the groom has to pay
[1:19:13] a price
[1:19:14] to the father of the bride
[1:19:17] next
[1:19:18] comes the betrothal or the jerusalem
[1:19:21] ceremony
[1:19:22] at this point stage in time they're
[1:19:25] legally
[1:19:26] married
[1:19:27] and a divorce would need to be obtained
[1:19:30] to split them up
[1:19:32] this is legally binding
[1:19:34] marriage at this point and in ancient
[1:19:36] times
[1:19:37] it actually was the most important
[1:19:39] portion
[1:19:40] of the marriage process
[1:19:44] three then a year there's they would
[1:19:46] have a year waiting period that would
[1:19:48] take place
[1:19:49] where they could not live together as
[1:19:52] husband and wife
[1:19:54] next came taking possession of your
[1:19:56] bride
[1:19:57] which has been purchased
[1:20:00] this was done at the consummation of a
[1:20:03] ceremony where the husband took his wife
[1:20:05] into a private room
[1:20:07] and they were joined together in one
[1:20:09] flesh
[1:20:11] then after that's that a celebration
[1:20:13] took place
[1:20:15] if the family was wealthy it was a
[1:20:17] week-long celebration
[1:20:20] all right so that's let's look at this
[1:20:22] spelled out in scripture matthew
[1:20:24] 1 18-20 now the birth of jesus christ
[1:20:28] was on this wise when as his mother mary
[1:20:32] was espoused or betrothed to joseph
[1:20:35] before they came together
[1:20:36] she was found with child of the holy
[1:20:38] ghost
[1:20:39] then joseph her husband being a just man
[1:20:41] and not willing to make her a public
[1:20:42] example
[1:20:44] was minded to put her away privily
[1:20:47] you see there he had to
[1:20:49] actually
[1:20:50] write a certificate of divorce even
[1:20:52] though they hadn't been joined together
[1:20:56] she was found with child of the holy
[1:20:58] ghost he would he was going to think he
[1:21:00] was thinking there i'm going to divorce
[1:21:02] her
[1:21:03] but while he thought on these things
[1:21:05] behold the angel of the lord appeared
[1:21:06] unto him in dreams saying joseph thou
[1:21:08] son of david
[1:21:09] fear not to take unto thee mary thy wife
[1:21:12] for that which is conceived in her is of
[1:21:13] the holy ghost so there we see the whole
[1:21:15] process he was betrothed to her
[1:21:18] right there's a he was during the
[1:21:19] waiting period that the holy spirit over
[1:21:21] overshadowed mary
[1:21:23] and he says i'm going to divorce her so
[1:21:25] he they're legally bound
[1:21:28] at that point in time to to one another
[1:21:31] all right but then the last process the
[1:21:34] the lord appears in a dream and says
[1:21:37] take
[1:21:37] mary
[1:21:38] as your wife take her to yourself that's
[1:21:41] the that's the last process is the
[1:21:43] claiming
[1:21:45] of the bride
[1:21:47] all right
[1:21:50] so
[1:21:51] first there's that patrol that that
[1:21:53] marriage proposal
[1:21:54] if it's accepted by the bride's family
[1:21:57] then they immediately set the dates
[1:22:01] for the
[1:22:02] there's a ceremony so
[1:22:04] after the betrothal takes place they
[1:22:05] actually have a ceremony
[1:22:07] and
[1:22:09] what they what they actually do is the
[1:22:10] engaged couple
[1:22:12] drinks wine from the same
[1:22:15] cup
[1:22:16] and
[1:22:17] an engagement blessing
[1:22:19] is pronounced over them after they've
[1:22:21] taken that oath
[1:22:23] to seal their betrothal matthew
[1:22:26] 26 27 says and he took the cup
[1:22:30] and gave thanks and gave it to them them
[1:22:32] saying drink he
[1:22:34] all of it
[1:22:35] so this is the this is an engagement
[1:22:38] ceremony taking place
[1:22:41] there at the last supper
[1:22:44] together they drink out of that cup
[1:22:47] um
[1:22:49] once the ceremony takes place they drink
[1:22:51] the cup together the blessing is said
[1:22:53] now you got to pay
[1:22:58] now the father the father of the bride
[1:23:00] has to pay whatever the agreement
[1:23:02] was made
[1:23:04] there the contract is made the price has
[1:23:07] to be paid
[1:23:09] first corinthians 6 20 says for you are
[1:23:11] bought with a price
[1:23:13] there therefore glorify god in your body
[1:23:16] and in your spirit which are
[1:23:18] gods
[1:23:19] uh
[1:23:20] did we miss first corinthians i might
[1:23:22] have missed it in my
[1:23:24] thing that's all right
[1:23:26] first peter 1 18 and 19 for as much as
[1:23:29] you know
[1:23:30] that you are not redeemed with
[1:23:32] corruptable things as silver and gold
[1:23:34] from your vain conversation received by
[1:23:36] tradition from your fathers but with the
[1:23:38] precious blood of christ as of a lamb
[1:23:41] without blemish without spot
[1:23:44] when
[1:23:45] he wanted to pay a price for his bride
[1:23:47] what did he do he shed his own blood
[1:23:50] that was the purchase price he shed his
[1:23:52] own blood he gave his own life
[1:23:54] to make the purchase
[1:23:56] of his own bride
[1:23:59] so
[1:24:00] just
[1:24:02] you know in ancient times there was two
[1:24:04] parts always of a financial transaction
[1:24:06] you paid
[1:24:08] then you take possession
[1:24:11] first ephesians 1 14 says which is the
[1:24:13] earnest
[1:24:14] the down payment
[1:24:16] of our inheritance until the redemption
[1:24:18] of the purchased
[1:24:20] possession unto the praise of his glory
[1:24:22] so
[1:24:23] he paid the price at calvary right
[1:24:26] that's the start
[1:24:28] that's that's that's how the the
[1:24:30] marriage process
[1:24:31] that's how the joining begins
[1:24:34] but he has he didn't take possession yet
[1:24:36] he's gonna in the future
[1:24:39] from that point in time come
[1:24:41] and take possession
[1:24:45] and in the hebrew language that's often
[1:24:47] how they spoke i think it's probably not
[1:24:50] very
[1:24:50] politically correct
[1:24:52] today
[1:24:53] to purchase
[1:24:55] your bride and take her as a possession
[1:24:59] in our day and age
[1:25:04] we're a little more revelated today
[1:25:12] a whole other topic
[1:25:15] so
[1:25:16] there's there has to be
[1:25:19] that sum of money that's paid but then
[1:25:20] there has to be an acquisition
[1:25:23] of that which has been paid you have to
[1:25:26] come
[1:25:27] and take
[1:25:28] possession of your property
[1:25:31] okay
[1:25:32] again i'm sorry for that language
[1:25:36] in our day and age
[1:25:37] but we're christ's property
[1:25:39] that's how the bible speaks
[1:25:41] i'm not sorry for how the bible speaks
[1:25:47] we are his purchased possession
[1:25:49] he he paid the price he shed his blood
[1:25:52] great price great suffering
[1:25:56] but it hadn't taken taken his possession
[1:26:00] that's what the seals is all about right
[1:26:03] he's there's two parts of redemption
[1:26:06] paying the price taking possession
[1:26:09] when he took the book
[1:26:11] i'm getting ahead of myself but i might
[1:26:12] as well
[1:26:14] when he when he took the book
[1:26:16] what is he doing he's saying this is my
[1:26:19] this is the title deed to my property
[1:26:22] the names of everyone are on that
[1:26:25] the truth about who they are is on that
[1:26:27] right
[1:26:29] and so i'm gonna take my possession now
[1:26:31] of my property he breaks open those
[1:26:32] seals he comes down and says okay i'm
[1:26:35] gonna join be one
[1:26:37] with that which i purchased
[1:26:40] matthew 25 1-13
[1:26:44] the parallel of the ten virgins of
[1:26:45] course
[1:26:46] you know this is this is just to give a
[1:26:48] picture of what marriage is in this case
[1:26:52] he's typing believers as
[1:26:55] the bridesmaids he's not typing them as
[1:26:57] a bride specifically
[1:26:59] in this but it gives us a picture
[1:27:02] of a marriage
[1:27:04] in those days then shall the kingdom of
[1:27:06] heaven be likened unto ten virgins
[1:27:09] which took their lamps and went forth to
[1:27:10] meet the bridegroom
[1:27:12] and five of them were wise and five were
[1:27:14] foolish
[1:27:16] so they knew that the bridegroom was
[1:27:17] coming
[1:27:19] the the hour was set the time was set
[1:27:22] he's coming but they don't know exactly
[1:27:23] when he's
[1:27:25] going to arrive
[1:27:27] all right so they go out to meet him
[1:27:29] they that were foolish took their lamps
[1:27:31] and took no oil with them but the wise
[1:27:33] took oil in their vessels with their
[1:27:34] lamps
[1:27:35] while the bridegroom tarried they all
[1:27:37] slumbered and slept
[1:27:40] and at midnight there was a cried maid
[1:27:44] behold the bridegroom cometh go you out
[1:27:46] to meet him that's the message
[1:27:49] so the message is is a cry
[1:27:52] that the bridegroom is coming go go out
[1:27:54] to meet him
[1:27:56] verse 7 then all those virgins arose and
[1:27:58] trim their lamps and the foolish said
[1:27:59] unto the wise give us of your oil
[1:28:02] for our lamps are gone out but the wise
[1:28:04] answered saying not so lest there not be
[1:28:05] not enough for us and you but go ye
[1:28:08] rather to them that sell and buy for
[1:28:10] yourselves and while they went to buy
[1:28:12] the bridegroom came and they that were
[1:28:14] ready went in with him to
[1:28:16] the marriage
[1:28:17] or the nuptials
[1:28:21] and the door was shut afterward came
[1:28:23] also the other virgins saying lord lord
[1:28:25] open to us
[1:28:26] but he answered and said verily i say
[1:28:28] unto you i know you not
[1:28:30] watch therefore for you know neither the
[1:28:32] day nor the hour wherein
[1:28:35] the son of man cometh
[1:28:38] so i don't want i want to get
[1:28:40] sidetracked in the teaching about the
[1:28:41] ten virgins the picture is a marriage
[1:28:44] the son is leaving the father's house
[1:28:46] to retrieve his espoused wife
[1:28:49] they're going to
[1:28:52] have a ceremony
[1:28:54] then they're going to go into a tent
[1:28:57] and they're going to be joined together
[1:28:58] as one flesh
[1:29:00] that is for the for the jewish
[1:29:04] tradition
[1:29:05] and and the biblical custom the ceremony
[1:29:08] is not what joins them together it's
[1:29:10] them coming together in a physical union
[1:29:13] in the tent that makes them married
[1:29:16] that completes the process
[1:29:18] of marriage
[1:29:19] all right
[1:29:21] so in those days
[1:29:23] it was customary
[1:29:25] for the son to choose a friend
[1:29:28] to communicate on his behalf
[1:29:31] he's called a friend or a companion
[1:29:34] of the bridegroom
[1:29:35] judges
[1:29:36] 14 10 and 11.
[1:29:40] so his father went down under the woman
[1:29:42] and samson made there a feast
[1:29:45] for so used the young men to do
[1:29:47] and it came to pass when they saw him
[1:29:49] that they brought 30
[1:29:51] companions
[1:29:52] to be with him
[1:29:54] so the companions of the bridegroom
[1:29:56] that's like
[1:29:57] what we call
[1:29:59] groomsmen
[1:30:00] today
[1:30:02] but a different responsibility in a
[1:30:04] different picture so here is the
[1:30:05] choosing out of 30 companions for him
[1:30:08] after he
[1:30:10] goes down there to make the feast
[1:30:13] so john 3 29 says he hath
[1:30:16] he that has the bride is the bridegroom
[1:30:18] but the friend of the bridegroom
[1:30:20] which standeth and heareth him rejoices
[1:30:22] greatly because of the bridegroom's
[1:30:24] voice
[1:30:25] this my joy therefore is fulfilled
[1:30:29] so as john the baptist forerand the
[1:30:31] first coming of christ there's a friend
[1:30:33] of the bridegroom
[1:30:36] brother branham was sent with a message
[1:30:38] to forerun
[1:30:40] the second coming of christ
[1:30:42] another friend of the bridegroom who is
[1:30:44] the one that says behold the bridegroom
[1:30:46] comes
[1:30:47] it's the friend that's the best man
[1:30:50] it's the friend of the bridegroom
[1:30:52] all right
[1:30:54] john
[1:30:56] 2 8 and 9
[1:31:00] and he saith unto them draw out now and
[1:31:02] bear unto the governor of the feast
[1:31:05] and they bear it when the ruler of the
[1:31:07] feast had tasted the water
[1:31:09] that was made wine and knew not whence
[1:31:11] it was but the servants which drew the
[1:31:13] water knew the governor of the feast
[1:31:15] called the bridegroom again here's
[1:31:18] here's another title the governor of the
[1:31:20] feast governor of the feast many times
[1:31:23] was the friend of the bridegroom
[1:31:25] so here we have the marriage taking
[1:31:27] place
[1:31:28] and who's who's presiding over it the
[1:31:31] best man
[1:31:33] it's beautiful
[1:31:35] there's another word that's connected
[1:31:37] with
[1:31:38] marriage in the bible it's called the
[1:31:39] hoopa
[1:31:41] this is spoken of several times psalm 19
[1:31:44] verse 5
[1:31:45] which is as a bridegroom coming out of
[1:31:48] his chamber or his hoopa
[1:31:50] and rejoiceth as a strong man to run a
[1:31:52] race
[1:31:54] the next one is isaiah 4 5 and the lord
[1:31:57] will create upon every dwelling place of
[1:31:59] mount zion and there are upon her
[1:32:02] assemblies a cloud and smoke by day
[1:32:04] and the shining of a flaming fire by
[1:32:06] night for upon all the glory shall be a
[1:32:10] defense
[1:32:11] but that's the word hoopa
[1:32:13] so for all the glory shall be a hoopa so
[1:32:16] this again
[1:32:18] speaking of
[1:32:20] the place of marriage
[1:32:22] joel 2 verse 16 says gather the people
[1:32:25] sanctify the congregation assemble the
[1:32:27] elders gather the children and those
[1:32:29] that suck the breasts let the bridegroom
[1:32:32] go forth
[1:32:33] of his chamber this is speaks of his
[1:32:35] inner apartment
[1:32:37] and the bride out of her closet the
[1:32:39] hoopa
[1:32:42] okay so
[1:32:43] when the marriage
[1:32:45] nuptials as they call it take place
[1:32:48] it was first
[1:32:50] this is the taking possession portion of
[1:32:52] of marriage
[1:32:54] when those take take place first there's
[1:32:56] a ceremony
[1:32:58] which is performed
[1:33:00] by a rabbi
[1:33:02] but it's under a garment which is held
[1:33:04] up by
[1:33:05] four poles
[1:33:07] in other words it's like an open tent
[1:33:10] now i'm not trying to make great
[1:33:12] interpretations of tent visions
[1:33:15] and those different things i let the
[1:33:16] lord take care of that
[1:33:18] but there's a lot of
[1:33:21] pictures
[1:33:22] in brother branham's visions
[1:33:24] that you can see all over the bible
[1:33:28] and so here we have a great thing under
[1:33:30] the third pole taking place
[1:33:32] under a tent
[1:33:33] well
[1:33:35] the same thing there there's tents and
[1:33:38] things that are so important
[1:33:40] here in the marriage ceremony in the
[1:33:42] jewish
[1:33:43] culture
[1:33:45] so
[1:33:48] they have the ceremony again but then
[1:33:50] they go into the bridegroom's apartment
[1:33:52] or his inner chamber
[1:33:54] it's either a tent or a private secret
[1:33:56] room
[1:33:58] where
[1:33:58] husband and wife are joined together
[1:34:01] and then they come out and have a feast
[1:34:03] it's very strange
[1:34:04] but even today if you were to go to an
[1:34:07] orthodox jewish
[1:34:08] wedding they have a special room set
[1:34:11] aside for the husband and wife
[1:34:13] they're at the wedding hall for
[1:34:16] the jewish customs
[1:34:24] all right and it's a secret place right
[1:34:26] it's only for
[1:34:28] the bride and groom to be together
[1:34:30] to join as one
[1:34:33] in that place
[1:34:34] so i'm going to read again
[1:34:37] the quote
[1:34:38] i only had a portion of it before i want
[1:34:40] to read the whole thing
[1:34:42] from proving his word now remember that
[1:34:44] was not jesus talking to abraham there
[1:34:46] that could discern the thoughts and
[1:34:47] sarah's mind behind him that was not
[1:34:49] jesus he had not
[1:34:50] yet been born but it was a man in human
[1:34:53] flesh that abraham called elohim the
[1:34:55] great almighty showing and jesus said it
[1:34:58] as it was in the days of sodom now watch
[1:34:59] close
[1:35:00] in the days of sodom so will it be at
[1:35:02] the coming of the son of man
[1:35:04] when the son of man is being revealed
[1:35:07] not no more as a church see not no more
[1:35:09] the bride is called see
[1:35:11] in that day the son of man revealed will
[1:35:13] be revealed what to join the church to
[1:35:16] the head unite the marriage of the bride
[1:35:18] the bridegroom call will come right
[1:35:21] under right through this when the son of
[1:35:23] man will come down and come in human
[1:35:25] flesh to unite the two together
[1:35:27] the church has to be the word
[1:35:30] he is the word and the two unites
[1:35:32] together and to do that it'll take the
[1:35:35] manifestation of the revealing of the
[1:35:37] son of man
[1:35:39] not a clergyman i don't know i
[1:35:42] do you see what i mean see it's the son
[1:35:43] of man jesus christ
[1:35:45] will come down in human flesh among us
[1:35:48] and will make his word so real that
[1:35:50] he'll unite the church and him as one
[1:35:53] the bride
[1:35:54] and then shall go home to the wedding
[1:35:56] supper amen she's already united see we
[1:35:59] go to the wedding supper not to the
[1:36:00] marriage fill your flesh of all the
[1:36:03] flesh of the mighty man because the
[1:36:04] marriage of the lamb has come but the
[1:36:06] rapture is going to the wedding supper
[1:36:09] when the word here unites with the
[1:36:10] person and they too become one
[1:36:13] and then what does does it do to them it
[1:36:15] manifests the son of man again not the
[1:36:17] church theologians the son of man
[1:36:20] the word and the church becomes one
[1:36:22] whatever the son of man done he was the
[1:36:24] word
[1:36:24] the church does the same thing
[1:36:28] amen there's an invisible union
[1:36:31] that's taking it's a spiritual marriage
[1:36:33] it's not a physical marriage it's a
[1:36:35] spiritual one what does it take the son
[1:36:37] of man coming down
[1:36:40] in spirit form
[1:36:41] to come into his bride and be one with
[1:36:44] her that what is what what is that that
[1:36:46] took place
[1:36:47] a marriage
[1:36:49] a joining together an invisible union
[1:36:52] that's the picture that we're seeing
[1:36:54] today
[1:36:55] uh genesis
[1:36:57] 24 67 and isaac brought
[1:37:00] her into his mother
[1:37:02] sarah's tent
[1:37:05] again a tent
[1:37:07] in the picture in marriage i i
[1:37:10] i want to emphasize i'm not trying to
[1:37:11] interpret brother branham's
[1:37:13] vision
[1:37:14] okay
[1:37:16] but it's very interesting
[1:37:19] that this image of a tent would be there
[1:37:22] and you go in one way and you come out
[1:37:25] another way
[1:37:27] that's very interesting
[1:37:28] what all that means
[1:37:30] i don't know but when i look at the
[1:37:32] bible
[1:37:33] and see marriage
[1:37:35] i see tense
[1:37:37] so isaac brought her brought her into
[1:37:40] his mother sarah's tent
[1:37:41] and took rebecca and she became his wife
[1:37:44] and he loved her and isaac was comforted
[1:37:47] after his mother's death this is the
[1:37:49] claiming
[1:37:50] of the purchased possession
[1:37:53] now she's now she's his wife they're one
[1:37:56] so then we come to deuteronomy 22.
[1:38:01] again more of the marriage traditions
[1:38:03] will read through this
[1:38:05] somewhat quickly if any man take a wife
[1:38:07] and go in unto her and hate her
[1:38:09] and give occasions of speech against her
[1:38:11] and bring up an evil name upon her and
[1:38:13] say i took this woman and when i came to
[1:38:15] her i found her not
[1:38:16] a maid then shall the father of the
[1:38:18] damsel and her mother take and bring
[1:38:20] forth the token of the damsel's
[1:38:22] virginity unto the elders of the city
[1:38:24] and the gate and the damsel father shall
[1:38:26] say unto the elders
[1:38:28] i'm not going to expound on this you're
[1:38:30] going to have to read between the lines
[1:38:32] there's kids here
[1:38:35] take and bring forth the tokens of the
[1:38:36] damsel's virginity and the elders of the
[1:38:38] city and the gate and the damsel's
[1:38:39] father shall say unto the elders i gave
[1:38:42] my daughter under this man to wife and
[1:38:44] he hateth her
[1:38:45] and lo he hath given occasions of speech
[1:38:47] against her saying i found not a
[1:38:49] daughter thy daughter a maid
[1:38:51] yet these are the tokens amen
[1:38:54] these are the tokens of my daughter's
[1:38:56] virginity
[1:38:57] and they shall spread the cloth before
[1:38:59] the elders of the city then the elders
[1:39:01] of that city shall take that man and
[1:39:03] chastise him
[1:39:04] and they shall immerse him in a hundred
[1:39:06] shekels of
[1:39:07] silver
[1:39:09] and give up them unto the father of the
[1:39:11] damsel because he hath brought up an
[1:39:13] evil name
[1:39:14] upon a virgin of israel and she shall be
[1:39:17] his wife he may not put her away all his
[1:39:19] days
[1:39:20] but if this thing be true and the tokens
[1:39:22] of virginity be
[1:39:23] not found for the damsel so that's what
[1:39:26] i want to emphasize is
[1:39:28] there's tokens there's a token of your
[1:39:30] virginity
[1:39:32] he said you're a virtuous
[1:39:34] bride of christ you never sinned
[1:39:36] in the first place and he gave us a
[1:39:39] token amen
[1:39:40] he gave us the holy ghost the life
[1:39:42] that's in the blood
[1:39:45] that's the token to us today
[1:39:47] his very presence the son of man
[1:39:50] coming down into a body of people to
[1:39:54] reveal himself through that people
[1:39:55] that's the token of your virginity amen
[1:40:01] all right
[1:40:05] next
[1:40:07] let us be glad
[1:40:08] and rejoice and give honor unto him
[1:40:12] for the marriage of the lamb is come
[1:40:15] and his wife have made herself
[1:40:18] ready
[1:40:20] and to her was granted that she should
[1:40:21] be arrayed in fine linen clean and white
[1:40:24] for the fine linen is the righteousness
[1:40:27] of saints
[1:40:28] and he's he saith unto me right blessed
[1:40:31] are they which are called unto the
[1:40:33] marriage supper of the lamb and he
[1:40:34] sayeth unto me these are the true
[1:40:36] sayings of god
[1:40:38] brother branham was sent with a message
[1:40:40] to dress a bride amen
[1:40:44] so
[1:40:45] us making ourselves ready is what
[1:40:47] working ourselves into righteousness
[1:40:50] no we receive his righteousness
[1:40:53] right but it's it's that
[1:40:55] that token of the holy ghost
[1:40:58] coming into us making us that virgin for
[1:41:01] christ
[1:41:02] and what is it that's dr that word
[1:41:05] is addressing the bride
[1:41:08] amen and so we see there the marriage
[1:41:12] is one thing and then the marriage
[1:41:13] supper
[1:41:15] that verse speaks of two different
[1:41:16] things it's exactly what brother branham
[1:41:17] said
[1:41:18] you have the marriage of the lamb we're
[1:41:20] already married we're already joined in
[1:41:22] an invisible union
[1:41:24] then we have the second part which is
[1:41:26] what we're called unto which is the
[1:41:28] marriage supper that's what we go to
[1:41:29] when the rapture takes place
[1:41:32] so we see all these types and these
[1:41:35] shadows
[1:41:36] we see the betrothal taking place when
[1:41:39] christ
[1:41:40] drinks the wine with his disciples
[1:41:43] we see christ
[1:41:44] paying the price for his musicians if
[1:41:46] you'd come
[1:41:48] brother tony
[1:41:51] christ pays that price
[1:41:53] for his bride to purchase his bride at
[1:41:56] calvary
[1:41:58] then in this hour he comes down with an
[1:42:01] open book
[1:42:03] he comes by he takes
[1:42:06] what does he take he takes the
[1:42:09] title deed
[1:42:10] of his of his bride
[1:42:12] it takes that title deed
[1:42:15] and he says i'm claiming my possession
[1:42:18] and he comes down in spirit form
[1:42:20] he takes that bride
[1:42:23] and what does he do he becomes one with
[1:42:25] her
[1:42:27] consummates
[1:42:28] the marriage with her the word and the
[1:42:31] bride are one she is him
[1:42:34] now what what are we doing we're being
[1:42:37] made ready to go to the marriage feast
[1:42:40] amen
[1:42:41] it's a spiritual union of christ and the
[1:42:43] bride
[1:42:45] all right let's stand and pray
[1:42:52] heavenly father
[1:42:54] lord we're so so very thankful
[1:42:59] lord for the revealing of your word in
[1:43:01] this hour

[1:48:21] hey man i am so glad amen
[1:48:25] [Music]
[1:48:26] [Applause]
[1:48:29] you know i was thinking
[1:48:31] about as brother jason was just tying it
[1:48:34] all together
[1:48:35] and winding it up there i thought my
[1:48:38] isn't that incredible how that
[1:48:40] the
[1:48:41] i mean do you realize that our approach
[1:48:43] to
[1:48:44] even what it means to be a christian
[1:48:46] and what it means to be in union with
[1:48:47] christ is so opposite from
[1:48:50] the the rest of christianity who looks
[1:48:53] to some kind of organized denominational
[1:48:56] system
[1:48:58] you know you ever hear the old statement
[1:48:59] you can't trust the system
[1:49:01] believe me you can't trust those systems
[1:49:03] of man and i thought
[1:49:05] wow to be able to go through the bible
[1:49:08] and show
[1:49:09] how that
[1:49:11] what we understand to be a relationship
[1:49:13] with god what we understand to be real
[1:49:16] to be really the bride of christ in a
[1:49:18] relationship and to be able to track
[1:49:20] that to track it all through the
[1:49:21] scripture i i'd love to see somebody try
[1:49:23] to do that with denominationalism
[1:49:26] try to take denominationalism and track
[1:49:28] it and connect all those dots like that
[1:49:30] you know the bible speaks of
[1:49:31] denominationalism but it ain't good
[1:49:34] it is nowhere
[1:49:36] that you're going to find a harmony
[1:49:38] in the scripture like that to come out
[1:49:40] of the old testament into the new
[1:49:42] testament didn't matter where brother
[1:49:43] jason went he was able to show exactly
[1:49:47] what a prophet taught us about the
[1:49:49] invisible union about what it meant to
[1:49:51] have
[1:49:52] the seventh seal open to us it's not
[1:49:54] just doctrine is it friends it's not his
[1:49:57] knowledge
[1:49:58] it's a person
[1:49:59] amen you know i
[1:50:01] i thought about there right as you were
[1:50:02] you had you were beginning and
[1:50:04] you kept emphasizing and going back the
[1:50:06] way brother branham would say
[1:50:08] you know it's not open and but yet he's
[1:50:10] revealed it but then he's not revealed
[1:50:12] it but then it's been in the bible
[1:50:14] and you know it's not revealed say is
[1:50:17] the seventh seal revealed
[1:50:19] yeah you're it
[1:50:21] is it revealed to the public
[1:50:23] not the not not all the parts that
[1:50:25] pertain to the public believe me
[1:50:28] that's not something they're looking
[1:50:30] forward to because remember friends
[1:50:32] seventh seal runs all the way through
[1:50:34] the tribulation all the way through
[1:50:37] and there's parts of that of that
[1:50:38] seventh seal that are going to unfold
[1:50:40] you go home and read revelation 15
[1:50:42] you'll find out
[1:50:43] there is things coming and the
[1:50:46] messengers that god sent to the earth
[1:50:48] and in every age there was a
[1:50:51] partial opening of a seal a rejection of
[1:50:54] the word a temporary judgment was set
[1:50:56] but hey
[1:50:57] when those seven messengers clothed in
[1:50:59] linen when they come out of the temple
[1:51:01] of god to bring forth judgment into the
[1:51:04] world it's not temporary
[1:51:06] it's not partial it's the full on vials
[1:51:09] it's the judgments on full amen and that
[1:51:13] to think about it friends that
[1:51:15] that when you go back and you look at
[1:51:17] those seven messengers and clearly you
[1:51:19] can see as brother branham was showing
[1:51:21] us and tying the scriptures together
[1:51:23] that the world is looking for seven new
[1:51:26] people to come and they don't realize
[1:51:28] god has sent seven messengers in seven
[1:51:30] ages
[1:51:31] and their message that they brought in
[1:51:33] every age gave life to the believer and
[1:51:35] judgment to the unbeliever and so who
[1:51:38] more fittingly than to be those ones
[1:51:42] associated with those vials because the
[1:51:43] judgments are upon the earth that's why
[1:51:46] brother branham would say when he was a
[1:51:48] white wig one there remember
[1:51:50] and he said that was what that white wig
[1:51:52] was of judge
[1:51:54] and he said what made it seven angels
[1:51:57] amen praise the lord all through it
[1:51:59] doesn't matter where you go in the
[1:52:00] scripture where you go in the message it
[1:52:03] all is one harmonious beautiful picture
[1:52:06] of god's
[1:52:07] plan
[1:52:08] don't never think
[1:52:10] that
[1:52:11] god is caught off guard by anything
[1:52:13] happening in your life god's got this
[1:52:16] whole thing planned out mapped out
[1:52:18] synced out
[1:52:19] i mean it's it's it's already moving you
[1:52:22] don't he doesn't even need you to move
[1:52:24] it it's moving
[1:52:25] you don't need to move him he's moving
[1:52:27] you friends amen i i feel that pull of
[1:52:30] god moving us and he's moving the world
[1:52:33] the world can't stop itself
[1:52:36] it's on a path to self-destruction and
[1:52:38] it jesus foretold it 2000 years ago told
[1:52:41] exactly what would happen it's happening
[1:52:43] it's happening exactly like christ
[1:52:45] foretold it would he knew it would he
[1:52:48] knew sending the disciples and sending
[1:52:50] the gospel around the world wouldn't
[1:52:51] stop that because that's all part of
[1:52:53] god's plan too
[1:52:55] i'm glad to be on the winning side of
[1:52:56] the plan amen i'm glad blessed are your
[1:53:00] eyes for they see
