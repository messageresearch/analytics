[0:00] [Music]
[0:10] [Music]
[0:23] Good morning. Amen.
[0:25] So
[0:27] let's stand and have a word of prayer
[0:28] this morning.
[0:33] Dear gracious father, Lord, we come
[0:36] before you this morning, Father, in this
[0:39] Sunday school, Lord, we want to invite
[0:41] you come humbly before you and invite
[0:44] you into our presence this morning. But
[0:46] Lord, you could meet us here, that you
[0:49] could speak with us, Father, that
[0:51] something might be said that would be
[0:52] anointed of you, that the people could
[0:54] take hold of it, could grow their
[0:56] courage and their strength, be uh
[0:59] edified by it, Lord, that they would be
[1:03] able to further combat the the spirit of
[1:06] this age, Father, that they wouldn't be
[1:10] uh bogged down or or or
[1:13] weakened, Father, by the the spirits
[1:15] spirits, Lord, that would attack us both
[1:18] spiritually and physically, Lord. But
[1:21] Father, that people would have courage
[1:23] to take your word and apply it to every
[1:25] aspect of their life, Father. And that
[1:28] you would give us strength. We invite
[1:30] you into this Sunday school yet again,
[1:33] Father, you would meet us here and you
[1:36] would give me the ability to step out of
[1:38] the way and allow you to speak through
[1:39] me. We ask these things in the name of
[1:40] the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.
[1:42] Amen. man. So, we're going to um by the
[1:46] grace of the Lord, we are going to do uh
[1:49] part two of um my uh topic from last
[1:54] Sunday. Um
[1:56] uh faith is a choice. I want to turn to
[2:02] um
[2:05] Romans chapter 10 and verse 14 for our
[2:08] text.
[2:12] Um,
[2:17] and we'll do a we read this uh last
[2:20] time. Do a very quick little recap um of
[2:25] of last time and then we'll move into
[2:26] some hopefully the and we'll wrap it up
[2:29] after that. Um so it says
[2:33] um this is Romans 10 and verse 14.
[2:38] How then shall they call on him in whom
[2:42] they have not believed? And how shall
[2:44] they believe on him whom they have not
[2:46] heard? And how shall they hear without a
[2:48] preacher? And how shall they preach
[2:51] except they be sent? As it is written,
[2:53] how beautiful are the feet of them that
[2:55] preach the gospel of peace and bring
[2:56] glad tidings of good things. But they
[3:00] have not all obeyed the gospel. For
[3:01] Isaiah said, Lord, who hath believed our
[3:04] report? Finally, verse 17. So then faith
[3:07] cometh by hearing and hearing by the
[3:09] word of God. May have your seats.
[3:12] Um so I said I want to quickly recap um
[3:16] because I don't want to I have I want to
[3:18] get through my material and and finish
[3:20] it up today. Um but just so that you
[3:24] know everyone's uh up to speed with
[3:26] where we were. Um,
[3:29] you know, obviously talking about faith
[3:30] and faith being a choice and a decision
[3:32] that you make to accept the word of God
[3:35] regardless of your feelings or
[3:36] regardless of your, you know, what's in
[3:38] front of you. You you accept the word of
[3:40] God as as the absolute no matter what.
[3:44] Amen.
[3:44] And that's what um, you know, causes uh,
[3:48] the word of God to manifest. Um, I want
[3:50] to read this quote. I had referenced it
[3:52] last week, but I want I think it sums up
[3:54] kind of a lot of what I said um, last
[3:56] week. And this is from um God revealing
[3:59] revealing himself to his people. Said,
[4:01] "Now many times
[4:04] um now this may seem strange. Everybody
[4:06] be real reverent if you can get the uh
[4:09] person just what I was trying to do to
[4:11] the woman." Now context, he was just
[4:14] dealing with a lady in a prayer line and
[4:16] she was dealing with all kinds of stuff.
[4:17] She was dealing with like depression and
[4:19] illness and all these things. And he's
[4:21] talking her through it. He's, you know,
[4:23] kind of preaching with her for a while.
[4:25] And then he steps down and he starts
[4:26] kind of talking directly to her and has
[4:28] a whole conversation with her and kind
[4:30] of working through a lot of stuff. And
[4:32] then this is, you know, he prays for
[4:33] her. She gets her healing. And now he's
[4:35] addressing the people as to what just
[4:36] happened.
[4:37] Um, so he says, uh, I was trying to do
[4:40] with a woman, get her in the right
[4:42] mental attitude. She wouldn't have to be
[4:44] prayed for. The right mental attitude
[4:46] towards any promise of God will bring it
[4:47] to pass. Do you believe that?
[4:49] The word is a seed. Is that right? That
[4:51] a swer swed in the ground. and every
[4:53] seed will bring forth of its kind. If
[4:56] you need salvation, the seeds here. If
[4:58] you need healing, here's the seed in the
[5:00] word. The word of God is a seed. Put it
[5:03] in your heart. Don't dig it up every
[5:05] morning to see if it sprouted. Put it in
[5:07] there and leave it there. It's God b
[5:10] God's business to bring forth the
[5:12] harvest. You just leave it there. Water
[5:15] it by faith and praise every day
[5:18] thanking God for it. All right.
[5:20] Amen. Now um
[5:24] uh again a couple of bullet points that
[5:26] I want to hit. Um so number one, faith
[5:28] is based on a confession. We read that
[5:30] last time. No matter what you think
[5:32] about it, what you feel about it, what
[5:34] your logic and reason says, what the
[5:35] evidence is before you, you confess that
[5:38] the word of God is true in your
[5:39] situation because what you say changes
[5:44] the way you think. Right? We know and we
[5:47] use the example of how um even in like
[5:50] uh uh prisoner of war camps, they could
[5:53] take people who had just previously been
[5:55] willing to fight and die for a country,
[5:58] right? They were willing to give
[5:59] everything for a country and then just
[6:00] by simply day over day slowly getting
[6:03] them to confess something e not even
[6:07] contrary to their where they came from,
[6:09] but just a little criticism,
[6:11] right? Just a little criticism, a little
[6:13] critique. Oh, well, you know, I love my
[6:15] country, but here's this little problem
[6:17] I have with it. And then over time, you
[6:19] do that every single day. Get someone to
[6:21] confess something negative every single
[6:23] day, and eventually completely turned
[6:25] around and now they're completely
[6:26] against what they would have died for.
[6:29] Okay? And that's the exact same thing
[6:31] that your confession will do. Even if
[6:33] you don't feel that you believe it. Even
[6:35] if it seems like a lie when you say it,
[6:37] you say it anyways because eventually it
[6:40] will turn your thinking to be to have a
[6:44] correct mental attitude.
[6:45] You will convert your thinking to be in
[6:48] line with the word of God and then it
[6:50] will start bringing the promises of God
[6:51] to pass.
[6:53] Okay.
[6:55] Um
[6:58] now we of course all love that kind of a
[7:03] thought. We love that kind of preaching.
[7:04] We love that that aspect of the word of
[7:06] God that when the when we are in need of
[7:08] Jehovah Gyra, we can lay claim to a
[7:10] promise and Jehovah Gyra will come on
[7:12] the scene and be the provider. Okay.
[7:14] When we need healing, when we need um
[7:17] you know uh uh restoration in our
[7:19] family, when we need all these things,
[7:21] we like that aspect of it. However, a
[7:23] lot of times we
[7:26] will get bogged down in the details of
[7:30] the entire word of God,
[7:32] right?
[7:34] The word of God is not simply a book of
[7:36] pro it it is a book of promises, but
[7:39] that's not all it is. Right? The word of
[7:42] God is is an instruction manual
[7:46] for how to live your life in a way that
[7:49] is pleasing unto the Lord. Right. It is
[7:52] a it is a it is a it is our in you know
[7:56] what they call it the basic instructions
[7:58] before leaving earth.
[8:00] Right. It is the this the the the
[8:04] pattern that we choose to live our lives
[8:06] by so that our lifestyle
[8:10] will be pleasing to God and that the
[8:13] promises will be applicable.
[8:15] Right? You know, we can don't forget
[8:19] that the same atonement in Isaiah 53,
[8:23] the same atonement that was for our
[8:24] transgressions,
[8:25] Amen,
[8:26] was also for our healing and our healing
[8:28] was for our transgressions, it's the
[8:30] same atonement under the same promise.
[8:32] Okay? If you want Jehovah to be a
[8:35] provider and then he's also got to be
[8:38] your savior. And if you are living loose
[8:41] and not taking the the you're you're
[8:44] you're living in sin and not um bringing
[8:48] your life subject to salvation
[8:52] and and not bringing those things where
[8:53] you fall short under the blood, then you
[8:55] don't really have access to healing
[8:56] either,
[8:57] right? Because you're you're rejecting
[8:58] the atonement on rejection of one is
[9:01] rejection of the other.
[9:02] Yeah. And
[9:05] um so the other aspect of faith being a
[9:08] choice is choosing to believe the word
[9:10] of God even when it doesn't
[9:14] it's going to make changes to your life
[9:15] and lifestyle that you don't like.
[9:17] Amen.
[9:19] So um you know in my mind goes to Joshua
[9:22] chapter 24 and verse uh 14 and 15 where
[9:26] Joshua well I'm just going to uh I'm
[9:29] just going to read it. Um
[9:42] um Joshua uh no that's wrong one
[9:46] Joshua 24
[9:50] verse 14 it says now therefore fear the
[9:52] Lord and serve him in sincerity in truth
[9:55] and put away the gods which your fathers
[9:57] served in the other side of the flood
[9:59] and in Egypt and serve serve ye the
[10:01] Lord? And if it seemed evil unto you to
[10:04] serve the Lord, choose you this day whom
[10:07] you will serve, whether it be gods which
[10:10] your father served that were on the
[10:12] other side of the flood, or the gods of
[10:14] the Amorites in whose land you dwell.
[10:16] But as for me and my house, we will
[10:18] serve the Lord. Okay? At some point, you
[10:21] have to make a decision that this is
[10:23] this is what you believe and this is
[10:25] whom you're going to serve. this is the
[10:27] standard that you're going to hold
[10:28] yourself to because
[10:31] uh making a choice, right? You can say
[10:32] that you've made a choice, but if your
[10:34] lifestyle doesn't really,
[10:36] you know, line up, then it doesn't
[10:38] you're you're you didn't you didn't
[10:41] actually make that choice, right? This
[10:44] is from um three kinds of believers. It
[10:46] says, "But they sell out like Judas."
[10:49] There's the makeeliever, right? Some of
[10:52] them are highly talented people. And
[10:54] this makebeliever, watch that guy.
[10:58] That's the shrewd guy. This little guy
[11:00] that fills up quick and jumps up and
[11:02] runs out at every little phrase that he
[11:04] don't like. You don't pay no attention
[11:06] to him. He's just an unbeliever to begin
[11:09] with,
[11:10] right?
[11:11] So, you know, the sermon is, you know,
[11:13] three kinds of believers. And brother
[11:14] Ram says there's three kinds of
[11:15] believers in every church. And, you
[11:17] know, he breaks it down into these three
[11:18] categories. When you really get to the
[11:20] bottom of it, there's really only two
[11:20] kinds of believers. those who do and
[11:22] those who don't.
[11:23] Right? Because you you you know the
[11:25] unbeliever and the makebeliever are just
[11:27] two different you know aspects of
[11:30] unbeliever.
[11:30] Yeah.
[11:31] Right. The one just has convinced
[11:32] himself that he believes when he
[11:34] doesn't.
[11:36] Um let's see uh that uh make believe um
[11:40] where was that?
[11:42] Um little phrase doesn't like you pay no
[11:44] attention. He's just an unbeliever to
[11:45] begin with. But when you see this guy a
[11:48] makeeliever hangs on. And see, that's
[11:50] the Judas. That's him. Like, uh, like
[11:53] great talents. I'm going to call names
[11:55] here, which I really shouldn't do it,
[11:58] but I'm going to call them anyhow so
[12:00] that you'll know it. Like Elvis Presley,
[12:02] Red Foley, Ernie Ford, Pat Boon, Elvis
[12:05] Presley, a Pentecostal, Pat Boon, a
[12:07] Church of Christ. Red Foley, a deacon in
[12:09] the Church of Christ, and I think Ernest
[12:12] Ford is a Methodist. And all these
[12:14] people with those talents, smart out on
[12:17] television and people saying, "Ah, well,
[12:19] aren't they religious?" They sing songs
[12:22] that don't mean one thing.
[12:24] Yes, sir. Deceiving the world. What do
[12:28] they get out of it? Judas got 30 pieces
[12:30] of silver. Elvis a fleet of Cadillacs
[12:32] and a hundred or two $150 million
[12:36] um or a million dollars on records and
[12:38] things like that. Pat Boon and the rest
[12:40] of them, I don't care what church they
[12:42] belong to and everything. It's
[12:43] hypocrisy. It's a makebelieve. It's a
[12:46] front that their life proves out that's
[12:50] right.
[12:52] So,
[12:53] you know, we're seeing clearly that the
[12:56] the prophet of our age is laying out
[12:59] that there are people who will choose,
[13:03] you know, they will claim that they're
[13:04] choosing the the word of God, even maybe
[13:08] even think they're choosing the word of
[13:09] God, but if their actual lifestyle and
[13:12] the things that they choose on the
[13:13] dayto-day do not line up with the word
[13:16] of God, then they're they're not
[13:18] choosing the word of God, right? their
[13:20] faith is not in line with the word of
[13:22] God. No matter what they say, no matter
[13:24] what you might think, no matter what
[13:25] kind of afront they put on, if they're
[13:27] day, if your day-to-day lifestyle is not
[13:30] a constant day after day choosing of the
[13:33] word of God, even when it contradicts
[13:35] your feelings and thoughts on the
[13:37] matter,
[13:38] then you you you know, you're not
[13:41] choosing the word of God
[13:42] if that's not where you're at.
[13:45] You know, I
[13:47] I think of um you know, in this is from
[13:51] in Genesis um or sorry, uh where was I
[13:54] at?
[13:55] Uh it's right here. Numbers, I'm sorry.
[13:58] Numbers chapter 16.
[14:01] Um which I'm not going to turn to and
[14:02] read because I do not have enough time.
[14:04] But um this is the story of Kora and
[14:08] Dayan and Abram. Now, in case any of you
[14:11] all had not read that story in a minute,
[14:14] um, briefly, what happened is you have a
[14:17] Levite. He was from the tribe of Levi.
[14:20] He was from the tribe that God ordained
[14:22] to be the priest, the priesthood, right?
[14:26] That's Kora. And he gets a couple of
[14:28] Reubenites named Dayan and Abram to and
[14:32] they they get kind of upset because
[14:34] here's Moses leading the people. You
[14:36] have a a God-scent prophet for their
[14:39] day. He was God's representative on the
[14:41] earth. And he had under him a a a
[14:44] priesthood, a uh a ministry, a team of
[14:47] ministers, right? You have Moses as the
[14:49] prophet, you have Aaron as the pastor,
[14:50] and you have the the other Levitical
[14:53] priest as the ministry under Aaron. and
[14:57] they're ministering to the people, but
[15:00] Kora and Dayan and Aby Byron decide that
[15:04] they're not happy with the fact that
[15:06] Moses has this authority over God's
[15:09] people, right? They don't want to listen
[15:12] to the to the precepts of Moses. They
[15:14] don't want to follow Moses'
[15:15] instructions. They don't want to have to
[15:17] to be under, you know, what they see as
[15:19] some sort of bondage or control. But
[15:21] it's just simply Moses bringing them the
[15:23] word of God. And so they tell Moses,
[15:25] "Well, Moses, you know, I don't you're
[15:28] up on your high horse. You think that
[15:29] you're so so great and you know, you
[15:31] promised us this land flowing with milk
[15:32] and honey, and here we are in the
[15:33] desert, and you haven't produced
[15:34] anything, right? You've you've promised
[15:37] us this rapturing faith, Moses, and a
[15:39] promised land and a rapture, but it
[15:40] where is it?" And, you know, frankly,
[15:43] you know, your your your messages for
[15:45] for some uh you know, that was great
[15:47] when we were back in Egypt, but we need
[15:48] a different sort of a newer idea, a
[15:51] fresher take on the word of God. And so
[15:52] frankly, the entire congregation is is
[15:56] holy. Moses is we're we're God's people
[15:58] and God's people are holy. So isn't the
[16:00] whole congregation holy? And aren't we
[16:02] all qualified to bring our sensor before
[16:03] the you know our incense before God? And
[16:06] so Kora
[16:08] as a minister, right, he is in he is in
[16:11] the Levitical order yet is trying to
[16:14] sideline the prophet for the age.
[16:16] Yeah.
[16:16] Right. He's trying to you know uh you
[16:20] know that's that's great. That's your
[16:21] opinion, Moses. But, you know, we don't
[16:23] really need to follow that. We're tired
[16:24] of, you know, you telling us what to do
[16:26] because you know, you know, we have all
[16:28] of our whatever our reasoning is. And
[16:31] so, we think that the whole
[16:34] congregation, everyone can have this
[16:36] sort of direct uh uh not I don't want to
[16:39] say uh maybe direct is the wrong word,
[16:40] but they can just sort of uh bypass the
[16:43] ministry, right? We don't need you. we
[16:45] can all just sort of, you know, have our
[16:47] own religion and and we don't need the
[16:50] ministry or the prophet.
[16:52] And
[16:54] this is this is the confrontation that
[16:56] they have with Moses that ultimately
[16:58] leads to the earth swallowing them
[17:01] whole, right? That God did not accept
[17:04] that God was not with them. God did not
[17:06] agree that they didn't need a ministry
[17:08] or or a prophet. and that God did not
[17:10] think that they could just, you know,
[17:12] uh, have their own interpretation of the
[17:14] word and live as they saw fit. He did
[17:16] not agree with that. The Kora and
[17:19] Dayton, the leaders of that movement
[17:20] were swallowed a whole and the rest of
[17:21] them were burnt to death,
[17:24] right? And what happened, you know, and
[17:27] and it it spec it specifies
[17:31] that when they went down when the earth
[17:33] swallowed them that they could hear the
[17:35] screams coming up out of the pit, right?
[17:37] The people were screaming as they went
[17:39] down. And it so struck me when I'm
[17:42] studying this that it so parallels when
[17:45] brother Brandham because I just want to
[17:47] make a note the people Kora and Dayan
[17:49] these Reubenites they did what they did
[17:52] not do was say that they were rejecting
[17:54] Jehovah.
[17:55] They they of their own valition or of
[17:58] their own testimony were saying well we
[18:00] worship God. We're going to worship God.
[18:02] We just want to do it how we want to do
[18:03] it. Right? They were claiming to worship
[18:06] Jehovah. They were claiming to worship
[18:09] the same God. They were planning to
[18:10] offer the same sacrifices. They were
[18:12] going to do everything the way Moses and
[18:13] Aaron was going to do, but they just
[18:15] wanted to, you know, do it their own way
[18:17] and not include God's chosen uh
[18:20] ministry.
[18:21] And they go into the pit and it reminded
[18:24] me of when brother Brandham saw the
[18:26] vision of the churches, right? And here
[18:28] comes the Church of America naked and
[18:30] dancing to the beat of rock and roll,
[18:32] completely naked. And she goes off into
[18:35] this pit and you could hear the screams
[18:36] coming up.
[18:37] Yeah.
[18:38] Right. Well, what was it? She again,
[18:41] these were churches.
[18:43] That woman was not an atheist.
[18:47] Right.
[18:48] Okay. She wasn't secular. She wasn't,
[18:51] you know, some non she was claiming she
[18:53] was a church. She was claiming to be
[18:56] Christian.
[18:58] But she But what had she done? She had
[19:02] rejected her the the prophet for her
[19:04] day. She'd rejected all of this. She'd
[19:06] chosen to instead, you know, declare
[19:10] herself as her own headship.
[19:12] And the end result is she cannot be
[19:15] clothed by the word. So, she's naked and
[19:18] she's been blinded by
[19:21] she's blind to the fact, right? She's a
[19:23] church of Leodysia, poor, miserable,
[19:24] blind, and naked and doesn't know it.
[19:26] Amen.
[19:26] She has no idea. And it's, you know, so
[19:29] many times we get blinded by comparison.
[19:32] Yeah.
[19:32] You know, that's the spirit of the age
[19:34] to blind you with comparison. You know,
[19:37] I I I notice
[19:40] Brother Brandham said that she was
[19:42] dancing to the beat of rock and roll.
[19:44] Now, maybe I'm this might be a little
[19:46] bit pedantic, but I noticed he said rock
[19:48] and roll. In the music world, the term
[19:52] rock and roll refers to something kind
[19:53] of specific. We're talking about the
[19:55] music of Elvis Presley. Okay. He did not
[19:58] say she was dancing to the beat of heavy
[20:00] metal. She was not dancing to the beat
[20:02] of, you know, rap or any of this other
[20:04] stuff. Not to say that that's a
[20:05] justifiable thing. I'm just saying what
[20:08] she was participating in that made her
[20:10] in that condition was something so
[20:12] innocuous by today's standards.
[20:16] You know, you compare, you know, you
[20:19] know, come November 1st, people start
[20:21] playing Christmas music.
[20:22] Yeah. And you know, people will turn on
[20:24] the radio and start listening to, you
[20:26] know, Elvis crew on about his blue
[20:27] Christmas
[20:29] and people, we don't even think anything
[20:31] of it. Don't even think twice. It's
[20:34] like, no, that that right there is what
[20:37] will drag the church of America into the
[20:39] pit. As innocuous as that seems by
[20:41] today's standards, as simplistic. And
[20:44] the problem is we think, "Oh, well, this
[20:47] is the media that we'll consume. This is
[20:49] the the standard of holiness that we'll
[20:51] abide by. This is the standard of of um
[20:55] household structure and organization
[20:56] that we'll live by. You know, this is
[20:59] and it's so innocuous in comparison to
[21:02] today's standard. You know, oh well, you
[21:05] know, we we'll we'll have um uh you
[21:09] know, the the family structure, you
[21:12] know, you know, it's it's certainly uh
[21:15] you know, we're not allowing a a lot of
[21:17] this um you know, sort of new age
[21:18] thinking. And you know, we don't we
[21:20] don't promote sex before marriage in our
[21:21] young people. We don't do all of these
[21:23] things. You know, we don't we we
[21:24] discourage um uh you know, just just
[21:27] sort of uh uh like dating and things
[21:29] like that, you know, in the in sort of
[21:31] like the after the modern example in the
[21:33] modern uh the modern way.
[21:36] But we don't and and that's the
[21:38] standard, but it's like yeah, but but
[21:39] we'll still do things like um completely
[21:41] sidelining the the role of the father in
[21:44] that whole situation.
[21:45] You know, people will still do that. And
[21:47] it's well this is the line that you know
[21:50] we'll hold to because it's so far less
[21:52] than what the rest of the world is doing
[21:54] and so we think we're okay but the
[21:57] standard is not you know a mile this
[22:01] side of heathenism.
[22:03] Amen.
[22:03] Right? That's not the standard. The
[22:05] standard is the word of God and you you
[22:07] know one inch to the other side of that
[22:10] and you're completely out. You might as
[22:11] well go all the way.
[22:13] Right? you're not, you know, and now
[22:15] there's a difference between people
[22:17] making mistakes and failing and and and
[22:22] trying their best to hold to the
[22:23] standard and having their own uh um
[22:28] human mortality get in the way
[22:32] because if there's because God does
[22:33] judge the heart, but it is a heart that
[22:36] is longing for to do better. It is a
[22:38] heart that is longing to say, "Lord, I
[22:40] made a mistake. I don't want to do that
[22:42] again." and turning away from it. Not
[22:45] well, you know, I'm only human and I'm
[22:46] that's that's going to be my
[22:47] justification to just keep doing it.
[22:51] That's not those are two very different
[22:53] things.
[22:55] And so, if we're going to have faith in
[22:56] the word, we're going to have to make a
[22:58] decision. That's the decision that we
[23:00] have to make is to even when the message
[23:03] of the hour and the scripture instructs
[23:06] us to do things that doesn't even seem
[23:07] logical, don't even seem like it's
[23:09] something that it seems like uh almost
[23:13] we have this attitude of like, oh well,
[23:15] anything, you know, it just seems
[23:17] unreasonable, right? Well, that just
[23:19] seems unreasonable and fanatical,
[23:21] well, yeah, of course it seems fanatical
[23:24] in comparison.
[23:25] Yeah.
[23:26] Right. The whole purpose of the devil in
[23:29] this age is to make the actual word of
[23:31] God seem like fanaticism, to make it
[23:34] unattractive,
[23:36] to make it repellent. But that's but you
[23:39] have to go contrary to that. You have to
[23:41] say, "No, I don't care what I feel about
[23:44] it. I don't care what I'm thinking or
[23:46] feeling about it. I have to claim the
[23:48] word of God." And if you don't do that,
[23:50] then you're going to get swept away with
[23:52] everybody else,
[23:53] right?
[23:55] You're you're going to go to go the same
[23:57] direction as everyone else just 5 miles
[23:59] an hour slower.
[24:00] Right. You you end up at the same place.
[24:02] You just end up there later.
[24:07] Wow. That was
[24:09] not where I wanted to end this. Um
[24:15] I'll uh I'll I'll close up by saying
[24:17] this. I I suspect the song leader will
[24:19] be okay with me borrowing a minute or
[24:21] two. I'm the song leader. Um
[24:24] Yeah.
[24:25] Um,
[24:27] we accept every word of God, no matter
[24:29] how illogical and no matter how absurd
[24:32] it may seem to us and no matter how much
[24:34] it galls our feelings on the matter,
[24:37] because we know, all right,
[24:40] this is from um
[24:43] uh my new ministry 1959 says um I said
[24:48] that same God, hallelujah, that Jehovah
[24:50] Gyra, he just as much Jehovah Gyra today
[24:52] as he was on the Mount of Abraham.
[24:55] Amen.
[24:55] He can still produce an animal to his
[24:58] glory. Three squirrels was not a vision.
[25:00] I shot them. Blood came out of them. I
[25:03] dressed them and ate them. They weren't
[25:05] visions. They were squirrels. I said I
[25:09] said that same Jehovah Gyra trying to
[25:11] get his promise over to me in my
[25:13] thickness and dullness of mind, he could
[25:16] speak all my needs into existence the
[25:18] same as he could speak Abraham's need
[25:20] into existence. I no more than said that
[25:23] until sister Hattie sitting there crying
[25:26] now hadn't said a word and she said
[25:29] that's nothing but the truth.
[25:31] Amen.
[25:31] Okay. So here's this prophet said
[25:35] something told a story that it
[25:37] completely defies the logic completely
[25:41] defies rationality and yet she said
[25:44] that's nothing but the truth because she
[25:46] was going to take the word of God even
[25:47] on something that seemed absurd and and
[25:50] with her whole heart believe it and say
[25:52] that's the truth and because of that the
[25:55] word of God could provide to her
[25:56] anything that she needed in that moment.
[25:58] Whatever she needed in that moment was
[26:00] hers because she took the word of God on
[26:03] every aspect.
[26:04] Wow.
[26:05] Every single thing she laid claims. She
[26:08] said, "That's the truth."
[26:09] Amen.
[26:10] Okay. It he didn't he wasn't talking
[26:11] about healing. He wasn't talking about
[26:13] salvation for her boys. But yet she she
[26:17] accepted it anyways. And because of
[26:18] that, the entire promise of God, she
[26:21] accepted the entire promise of God. So
[26:22] the entire promise of God was to her.
[26:25] Okay?
[26:27] And and again and I'll and hopefully
[26:29] I'll I'll wrap up with this. I would
[26:32] just like to point out that God will
[26:35] never expect you to do something that he
[26:37] cannot do or will not do for himself.
[26:39] Amen.
[26:40] Okay? Even when Christ is facing the
[26:44] cross, he says, "Not my will but thine
[26:46] be done." Right? If this cup can pass,
[26:49] let it pass. "Not my will, thine be
[26:51] done." Why? Because Jesus did not want
[26:53] to be tortured to death. Nobody wants to
[26:56] be tortured to death. He was a man. He
[26:58] had a will. If he didn't have a will, he
[27:00] would not have said, "Not my will."
[27:02] Right? He had will. He had desire. He
[27:05] had things in his flesh that he didn't
[27:07] want to die.
[27:09] Right? And yet, he said, "I don't care
[27:12] about my flesh." The Lord made a
[27:14] promise. Now, we hold to a promise for
[27:16] healing and for salvation. But what was
[27:17] the promise that Christ was holding to?
[27:20] You. You were the promise that Christ
[27:22] was holding to. You were what he was
[27:23] sacrificing his flesh for you, your
[27:26] salvation. And that's where we need to
[27:29] come. You know, Christ literally had to
[27:31] reject his own flesh and reject his own
[27:33] comfort and reject his own uh you know,
[27:37] pride, reject his own his own um
[27:40] comfort. You know, it's very
[27:42] uncomfortable to be tortured to death.
[27:44] And he accepted anyways. And not only
[27:46] did he have to die, he had to go to a
[27:47] sinner's hell. He had to become a sinner
[27:50] on your behalf and then go to a sinner's
[27:52] hell. And now the key to this is he
[27:54] didn't stay there,
[27:56] right? He showed that he was more than
[27:58] just a sinner, you know, because he came
[28:00] back. He he rose again on the third day.
[28:03] And likewise, we have to even when in
[28:07] the face of things where the where we
[28:09] are taught to to live our lives and in
[28:12] in a way that we find uncomfortable, we
[28:14] are taught to live our lives in a way
[28:16] that we don't find logical. We hear uh
[28:18] you know the prophet of our age tell us
[28:20] things that we don't necessarily like
[28:22] and yet you you say not my will thine be
[28:25] done. It's not my feelings but God's
[28:28] feelings. It's not my memory. It's God's
[28:32] memory. Let God's memory dictate how I
[28:34] live. Not my memories of my past. It's
[28:38] you know God's view of you is how you
[28:40] need to live. Not your view of you. You
[28:43] know, because if you're willing to do
[28:46] that, right, that if you're willing to
[28:49] take up your cross and sacrifice your
[28:51] will and your thinking for God's word,
[28:55] then you will come up in the same
[28:56] resurrection that Christ did. You'll be
[28:58] have access to the same resurrection
[29:00] power and you will you will join Christ
[29:03] in that resurrection. I have to stop.
[29:07] Thank you for your time. Let's all stand
[29:09] and have a word of prayer.
[29:13] Gracious Father, Lord, thank you for
[29:15] this this morning, the Sunday school.
[29:17] Lord, I ask that you would meet us yet
[29:19] again in the in the uh in the worship
[29:21] service. Father, that you would let your
[29:24] spirit move, that the hearts of the
[29:26] people would be open to you, the hearts
[29:29] of the people would be uh
[29:33] would be open to to your word. that Lord
[29:35] that Father, we know that whatever we
[29:37] would have need of that you would be
[29:38] able to move upon our life. Even those
[29:40] things that if what we would have need
[29:41] of is is uh a correction or or or to be
[29:46] delivered of things that that Father,
[29:48] you're more than willing and ha and and
[29:50] able to deliver us from the the
[29:52] difficulties of our own flesh.
[29:55] lot father that that when when you have
[29:58] instructed us to to live according to
[30:01] your word you would not simply instruct
[30:02] us without a provision to follow that
[30:04] instruction. So, Father, we hold to that
[30:06] promise that you would mold us and shape
[30:08] us and keep us, Father. That you would
[30:11] meet us here again in the sanctuary,
[30:14] Father, in our worship, that you could
[30:15] tend to our hearts and bring us closer
[30:17] to you.
