praise the lord praise the lord real quick um last week throughout last week we were um persecuted pretty harshly through someone in our community and um it was kind of rough because the person attacked not only our business but our character and one of the statements that she made publicly was that we were wolves in sheep clothing so uh caitlyn and i both took that pretty personally but um you know the more we just really listened to the lord as he was speaking to us through that trial was that you know we're supposed to be persecuted we're supposed to stand out and be a difference and um so i just kept thinking how to handle the situation and i tried to reach out to her in love she didn't want to communicate with us and so you know i just kept feeling you know lord you didn't say anything when you were being beaten and bruised and um so he just kept saying keep your mouth quiet and just keep living living the life so i'm only singing this [Music] it's a hard song because my dad so i hope i could get through it and i'm thankful he came up and sang with me because i'm a backup singer he's the lead so if you know it just sing it because i don't want to sing about myself once was lost but now i'm found i once was lost but now i'm [Music] but i'm home now once was but now i'm fine and now my life song sings [Music] i once was blind [Music] when he touched me i once was

morning amen y'all be coming it might be great amen man i want to say i really love being able to see and pull on the different gifts i mean it's people that have gifts to sing and just sitting here and not really realizing or not wanting to admit it but sometimes just by surrendering your own will and desire you can bless others man so i really appreciate that that's awesome i really like it man let's give them a hand hey man clear skies grew black his angry thunder rolled in smashing waves driven by mad howling wind one lonely vessel so close to home and one frantic captain barely keep in control the lighthouse on the hill [Music] could have ended his plight but it's dim beacon's glow hardly cut through in the night [Music] though he strained he could not see [Music] for the lack of some light he heard the crack of the hole the ship soon was full was the captain's last night and all to the thanks of a lazy light keeper [Music] the fire did burn but it was only within it did not reach out to the ones that were needy [Music] poet could not reach out for there was soot on the limb one man a drift [Music] on life's troubled sea i maintain this lighthouse and it's all up to me [Music] but my beacon shines through this darkened world of sin or will he like the captain soon see his end [Music] oh i don't want to be a lazy light keeper hope my fire does burn but isn't only within will it reach out to the ones that aren't oh can it reach out [Music] or is there soot on my lid oh i don't want to be a lazy light keeper for my fire does burn but isn't only [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] how can it reach out [Music] or is there soot on my lens [Music] can it reach out or is there soot on my [Music] lens [Applause] [Music] sorry [Music] i believe there are streets of gold but it's all right with me if there's nothing more than worn oh and i know a mansion's waiting but a cabin soothes me fine just a place where i can rest my heavy load oh they say there is a river that flows beneath the throne and the surface that reflects that holy place [Music] oh i'm sure that all the splendor [Music] will be so grand to see what i long to see the most is jesus face [Music] cause that's all that murders to me [Music] to bow my head and thank my blessings savior on my knees on those peaceful hills of glory in his presence i will be [Music] to know i'm home that's all that matters to me oh the lights of that fair city will never fade away it's a perfect place where night will never come [Music] but all the beautiful there can't compare to how i feel when i hear my precious lord say well done because that soul that matters to me to bow my head and thank my blessed savior on my knees on those peaceful hills of glory in his presence i will be [Music] to

just come out and enjoy it so it was so wonderful so so wonderful appreciated that anointing wow on that singing i felt like i've sometimes brother eddie said sometimes i want to blow through the roof and land out in the road amen and then run on up the road from there screaming amen so i sure appreciate that amen praise the name of the lord so appreciate all the visitors here this morning amen praise lord brother douglas glad to see you and your family here we're not much calling you visitor anymore though amen amen happy to have brother steve and and uh sister emily today and i'm sure there's others here that i'm overlooking i'm real bad for that so if you're here and i'm not calling you out just know i'm the worst in the world uh oh yeah here we go praise the lord brother matt brother matt praise the lord amen amen praise god any others god bless you greece in the name of the lord sure enjoyed that singing i hate that um uh you're you're we're because if we're under a local restriction so we can't have the whole church in social distance so this is half so the other half is just as pretty smelled just as good and if you stay around till next weekend you can meet the other half amen amen amen like amen [Music] [Laughter] amen praise the lord that be worth you staying around to meet trust me amen we're happy in the lord today we want to look right to the word of god and we've got a couple of prayer requests that came to me special my sister-in-law karen said please remember greg's daughter tatiana she is going through a lot in a bad situation and and just both of our families satan is attacking everyone so um that's brother greg and sister karen who stream from north carolina and um every time i talk to brother greg he's more on fire with the word of god and what god has done in this day amen praise the lord he's never heard anything like it he wants all of his brothers and his whole family to hear it amen so amen we're trying to see if we can figure out how to get that done so brother john phelan also requests the saints to pray for my brother-in-law matt won't try to pronounce that last name brother john he's in switzerland and uh who is he's undergoing brother john's brother-in-law is in switzerland undergoing diaphragm surgery associated with colon cancer i pray the surgeons find nothing to remove and a healthy body well wow what a way to say it and to give glory to the lord how many will agree with that amen praise the name of the lord so that's the only special request that came to me um i'm sure there were others and i'm sure that you have a need you know we talk a lot about about a raised hand and we say it almost becomes a you know autopilot thing you got a need raise your hand to the lord but you know something friends brother branham made a lot to do over raising your hand talked about how it defies gravity said it could actually save your life said it could be the difference between life and death you think just that yeah how can just that because god's watching so you know something god looks for that it so let me say today i'm sure that you have needs on your heart right now i'm sure you could think of one or two or five or ten so you've got a need you'd like to make known to the lord why don't you raise that hand and say lord remember me today you see my need amen let's pray before we read our scripture master we thank you for this lovely morning thank you for this group of people here present in the building and those lord streaming from home we long for the day to be all joined together again father i just i just want that so bad and and but yet we're we're trying to set the right example in our community lord and they're not asking too much of us that we can't work it out so we're working it out we believe we have your blessing but we sure do long to see it come back to full fellowship and everybody could be here together lord i commit that to you and ask you to bring it to pass remember this need of sister karen today for brother greg's family and both sides of the family the need for brother john that he puts in for his brother-in-law matt and having surgery lord you're the you're you're jehovah rafa your jehovah's shalom your jehovah jireh you're all of our needs you're all of our healing you're jehovah shaman you're jehovah sid canoe you're jehovah raya you're everything that we could need from the cradle to the grave those seven compound redemptive names lord what a promise it was what a comfort it was what are letting off of the pressure it was to your prophet when standing there hearing seeing that that that that that on the mountain seeing those crosses and that rainbow and a voice saying jesus that jehovah of the old testament is jesus of the new so father it was a great release for him to know that he had not erred in the scripture you confirmed it lord it's confirmed to us today and father we don't only recognize that every redemptive blessing you were under that name jehovah you are in the holy ghost today and we have access to it we commit these needs into your hands and every hand that was raised with unspoken needs and other perhaps other spoken needs lord we commit them to you and i ask you to remember my dear wife today lord the devil just tenaciously battling but he ain't nobody lord he's just a liar and a bluff and we're all bound together and our decision is firm that sister debbie's going to be well completely and we'll never change that confession and neither does she and lord we're claiming full and complete victory for her today i pray you'll grant it speed it along lord in jesus name we pray amen amen you love him so praise the lord let's go into our bibles today to revelation chapter 21. i want to continue with my series on the anointed kingdom this would be part [Music] 2. and um oh let's see i should have the controller yep got it right here so once we finish with the scripture we'll make sure that that's working good i'll wait to turn it on uh i won't turn it on just yet for the mat all right revelation chapter 21 verse 1 through 7. i saw a new heaven and a new earth for the first heaven and the first earth were passed away and there was no more sea and i john saw the holy city new jerusalem coming down from god out of heaven prepared as a bride adorned for her husband you can have confidence friends john saw it john saw it he wrote you a letter saying hey i saw it and i heard a great voice out of heaven saying behold the tabernacle of god is with men and he will dwell with them and they shall be his people and god himself shall be with them and be their god and god shall wipe away all tears from their eyes and there shall be no more death neither sorrow nor crying neither shall there be any more pain for the former things are passed away and he that sat upon the throne said behold i make all things new and he said unto me write for these words are true and faithful and he said unto me it is done i am alpha and omega the beginning and the end i will give unto him that is a thirst of the fountain of the water of life freely he that overcometh shall inherit all things and i will be his god and he shall be my son may the lord bless the reading of his word as you're seated all right so you should be on that number uh 12 title it's a blank screen but let's have that number 12 screen pulled up so i'm correct that i'm going to use this hey matty so it's not going to work in the propresenter okay all right praise the lord now i would think that the that blank 12 that number 12 screen would have a golden bar at the bottom i don't see that so let me advance um yeah okay you're not up yet very good all right go to slide 12. and slide 12 should be a black blank screen magnificent you're a beautiful man son thank you all right so so we're we're taking this thought and continuing on the anointed kingdom how many are glad to be the kingdom of god you know the kingdom means people you don't have kingdom without people and so it's a kingdom of saints amen it's a kingdom of christ and let me say it like this it's a kingdom of christ's it's a kingdom of kings and priests amen and so and it's real and it's coming say how do you know i'm already in it how how do i know i'm going to get my body changed it has so many weaknesses and i make so many mistakes well i you know you know the victory i get is i realize i'm a triune being so yeah i make mistakes but not all of me does this flesh which hasn't been converted and this mind which is this spirit's not converted and sometimes it thinks wrong and sometimes it does wrong but there's a part of me that's already translated and what he has begun he will finish so your change is coming it's already started so there is a kingdom and it's only going to get greater and greater brother branham that's one of the last things he points to us points out to us in the seventh seal and he just starts talking about he doesn't talk about what's happening in heaven he starts talking about what's happening he says right here in this service he said we got a leukemia child and a cancer patient and this over here and this boy and this girl and he said what is it he said what is it because they had been miraculously healed and and healed in a different way it seemed to be more of the spoken word the power of the third pull and brother brown says what is it what is it friends it's the kingdom coming as it has been so the kingdom is already among us friends don't look for another message the kingdom message is here now look for another message to give you a rapture the rapture message is here and all you need is to have faith and they say i'm trying to have faith how do i get more faith start aligning the other two parts of you with the inside part of you and i'm here to tell you a supernatural faith not yours his will begin to overtake and it'll work in your life the devil fears you'll get that so he tries every way in the world to distract you he's magnificently successful sometimes i am so impressed with lucifer and his ability to dupe god's family without a single weapon and brother branham said jesus took every weapon from him and the only weapon he has is a psychological warfare weapon and he said the only weapon satan has is if he can get you to doubt your weapon other than that he's a weaponless defeated foe that we face on june the 4th in 1940 winston churchill stood before the parliament of england to give an account of the disastrous defeat of dunkirk but the to announce also the very successful unprecedented saving of the entire british army and it was a feat unparalleled in war history it stands to this day as a seemingly an impossible task because literally everybody just ran down they didn't have enough navy ships to get them home so everybody the call went out over the radio and everybody ran down to their fishing boats and got on their fishing trawlers and got in their little motorboats and crossed the channel at peril with with enemy aircraft dropping bombs and trying to strafe them sometimes airplane squadrons a hundred numbering a hundred just trying to strafe the beaches and bomb the boats coming and and they went in there and loaded the entire british expeditionary force evacuated them from dunkirk and saved the british army and got them back across the channel and churchill while he acknowledges you know belgium's complete defeat the likely defeat of france while not conceding that they should stop fighting gives perhaps the greatest speech of his life and he had two more that followed it but they think that this speech probably was the greatest one he ever gave you can actually hear a recording of it i have a actual recording of it it's quite inspirational the entire speech about 12 13 minutes long but i wanted to come to one particular part today the most famous i would say by far and the most one referred to where he's just giving his resolve to the british people as bad as it looks as dire as the situation is and he didn't mince words and he didn't sugarcoat it and he said we should expect an invasion of our island and they were convinced that that was what hitler was going to do and hitler was in fact planning to do that when you know young airmen from the british royal air force took off in their spitfires and a little thin wall of defense and somehow the hand of god helped them to repel overwhelming numbers that were attacking them and churchill saying we should expect it because it's the next logical move this was napoleon's idea this is hitler's idea and we should prepare ourselves but he wanted to give a resolve to the british people that invade they might but surrender we won't and he said we shall defend our island whatever the cost may be we shall fight on the beaches we shall fight on the landing grounds we shall fight in the fields and in the streets we shall fight in the hills we shall never surrender and even if he goes on to talk about how that even if they do occupy this island they won't keep it as long as we're alive we will fight we finished last time talking about how that you know and i made that statement to you i will never stop fighting the devil that he cannot have my ground you know why because it's mine now it's supremely mine because the creator gave it to me everybody can run around the world national parliaments and governments can say this is our boundary country and this is our country you know native americans can say this land is our land and you took it from us well i only know and i'm not i'm not diminishing the the horrors that were done to them that this nation is still paying for but i don't know of but one track of land that was ever actually deeded to some humans and that was in palestine in the land of israel and god sent abraham on a mountain and said now look as far as you can see northward southward eastward and westward everything you can see i'm giving it to you abraham i built it i own it i'm giving it to you i don't care what those people that live there say i don't care what happens in history i don't care tyrants will rise and fall but this is your land and if they dispossess you from it and even if i allow it i will take it back for you and i will bring you back and i will put you back on it it's your land and you can never lose it and i'm here to tell you something friends that's our land in the holy ghost by the holy ghost we are enjoined by the through the blood of jesus back to abraham his land is my land and i'm not just talking about uh july you know real estate that you can find uh geosynchronous you can get uh you know gps coordinates and say here's the boundary lands of israel it's it's more than that i'm reading about a city i'm reading about a mountain that's not even on the earth yet hallelujah i'm reading about a new heavens and the new earth and i'm going to live there because he said i would it's mine how did you get entitled to it because i was an overcomer i was in christ and i overcome the deception of this hour and therefore since it's mine i don't give it up lightly i i have authority i have the promise of god that i can live above sin i don't always do it but i'm always fighting i can be well i don't have to be sick i do get sick but i'm fighting the devil brings sickness into my house them's fighting words the devil comes after my children that's fighting words the devil comes after my my marriage or my home my peace my tranquility my success that's fighting words friends and you might as well get used to it now you're gonna have to fight so come on fight on the beaches fight in the streets fight on the landing fight in the hills don't ever surrender you don't have to surrender you have the champion of all champions it's promised john saw it it's mine i'll not surrender my inheritance to the devil without having fought that to me would be i don't think i could live with that i live i do i do get through failures and i do realize sometimes i get pushed off a hill but it wasn't because i wasn't fighting i mean if i if i lost territory and something happened in my home or my family or my children and it was because i wasn't fighting i don't think i could handle that i mean we're going to fight it's going to be battles you're going to win some you're going to lose some but don't worry the war is won and all he's asking you to do is fight and it has nothing to do with the size of the dog in the fight it's the size and amount of the fight that's in the dog jesus was not a big man brother branham saw him brother i'm sorry i'm just hovering above and he said i stood there looking at him said he was a small man he said in stature he might weigh 140 pounds just a small man and he said and and he said i saw he said i thought in my dreaming i bit my finger and he said i'm trying to figure out is this a vision because he had had those he didn't even call him visions early called him a trance and he's just a young man and he said i i thought i'll get his attention oh he's looking he's looking eastward i'm going to walk around till i can kind of see him i don't want to be rude and he's trying to clear his throat i'd do the same thing you know or or maybe you'd be so terrified you wouldn't hardly be able to make a sound and he said i saw the sagebrush blow and he said when the sagebrush blew he said his garment started blowing in the wind it was real wasn't just a vision that was real and he said he looked at me and he said i said jesus and he said he turned and looked at me and put his arms out to me like you know welcoming and he said it's the last thing i remembered till daylight he said it was a look no artist could capture he said that that hoffman's head of christ which we have here the hoffman's head is a is a is a um what do you call a crop of that and and he said that's the closest he'd ever seen ex but he says except for his size he's not that big of a guy isn't that amazing every prophecy now that looks like him in the face but he's not that big he's a small man and he said when he looked he said no artist could catch those eyes and he said it looked like that you just wanted he a man of that that looks so so sorrowful that you could just want to break down and cry he said yet at the same time a look that was such a way that if he would speak just speak the world would end amen well tell you something friends that man lives in you hallelujah and you need to take ownership of that today and do whatever is necessary to give him rulership over the other two fallen sides of you he lives in a reborn state of you inside that soul and i just say lord take over my mind take over my life take over my body i i don't want to lose ground i want to gain ground i'm not here to sign a treaty with the devil i'm not here to give him quarter i'm never going to surrender and every morning god's mercies are new so you know what i do every morning you know what i did this morning i woke up and nullified the victories of satan from the day before i took back all my hills hallelujah i took back all my land hallelujah brother branham says in the message perseverant he says now you're ill you've been into a doctor see he would advise an operation that operation is on the colon yes the patient says here's another thing you're you're desperately in need of a spiritual yes amen you haven't been feeling right you've kind of washed away a little and you want to come back that's right the man says well you're back well you wanna you've kind of washed away a little bit but you wanna come back yes you're back congratulations you're back oh my well you're back now go believing with all your heart you'll get well in jesus christ's name your sins are forgiven you now go believing now it's interesting because brother branham i didn't continue the quote just to save us time putting more slides up brother branham says he comes back to microphone he says hey now did you hear that said his sins were forgiven he said now you you heard my voice he said but that wasn't me that said that so that was him he's the only one that can say that oh you're you're healed and hey your sins are forgiven say oh well that's not even scriptural it sure is scriptural that's exactly what jesus said you're he forgave their sins and healed their sickness because it's all in the same atonement see so so he comes down and and and and and the takeaway for me is is that any time that satan is successful now come on let's be real honest today sometimes he is sometimes you're you you get driven off a hill it doesn't mean you're not a child of god see sometimes this means a lot of corrections headed in see sometimes we listen friend to doubt any word of god is equal to doubting any other word of god so if if you if you don't if you don't exercise the word of god in a transgression and you commit that transgression that is no worse than looking at a promise that he speaks about your healing in the atonement and deny that and claim your sickness that's just as bad that's just as insulting to god that's just as much losing a heal or losing a hill you understand so so anytime satan is successful in taking land from me in any way in any way it happens then i'm going to tell you something it is a drawn out battle it is a drawn out battle because i'm going to be praying in the mornings i'm going to be praying when i go to bed i'm going to have a lifestyle of going to church i'm going to be reading my bible i'm going to be listening to tapes i i'm it's going to be a long drawn out battle and even if i do lose a hill it's going to be a big battle because i'm fighting every day because i just don't walk off my land that's that's being a christian that's what a christian is i might get drove off of it by my own weakness my own doubt and not taking god at his word and not overcoming like i could have there's no temptation taking you but such as his common demand get over yourself nobody's picking on you you ain't special god satan satan attacks us all you understand but within that temptation god makes a way for you to escape now he doesn't say you'll take it but he does make it there is a way and if you don't escape and i've had to come to that look at that man in the mirror and go you know you could have got out of that i know and that's what takes me to my knees come on am i the only part-time center in here i've passed from death unto life that's why i can talk like that because i know the devil ain't nobody i've already passed from death to life i'm in christ i'm in the kingdom the lord lives in me and i tell the devil all the time you do not matter you do not matter you're a big puppet that's all you are and if even if you're able to pull something off on me and bring me to a trial well it went past my father because i got his promise that you can't come after me unless he lets you ha and so so i don't just walk off my land i fight to keep it and it is always come on those of you who are born again of the holy spirit will identify with this it is always a regret in my heart if he's able to finally push me off of it that's the that's a sign of the holy ghost birth see a failure is not a sign that you don't have the holy ghost what is a sign that you do is that you repent else why why did you repent if you really wanted to do it the bottom line is your flesh might have but the real you didn't want to do it that's why i repent how did i get in that condition of not wanting sin because i got born again see and so it and so it's always a regret truly it's a regret in my heart if he's able to finally push me off my land but it is equally a great sense of pleasure when i take it back from him in a moment like brother branham with the man in the line you've been kind of washed away you've really got a spiritual need yes yes amen that's true and you really want you want to come back it's been a long battle yes and you want to come back yes you're back the devil's been victorious and you want to seem defeated yes he's defeated you want to come back to victory don't you yes you're back i i i fight him every day in a protracted battle and even if he pushes me off my heel he's gonna have to fight me but i take great pleasure brother jack in walking back up with a blood stain banner and putting it down like cerebache and say i claim this mountain and i take it back in a moment i don't have to go do penance i don't have to crawl on glass i don't have to go to rome i don't have to sit in a confessional i have access i'm a king and a priest i have access to god i take my land back that quick amen brother branham says here in the queen of sheba let me see if i can get it get it up here all right the queen of sheba here's a little girl sitting here watch this now girl's looking down you believe little lady on the lord jesus do you little green dress on sitting there yes that's her do you believe the lord jesus god trouble with your back haven't you that's right you have a prayer card you don't okay you don't need one let me tell you your back trouble's gone no need to blow a trumpet no need to have a parade no need to flashlights we don't need power technics you gotta back trouble don't you honey you don't have a prayer card do you it's okay you don't need one your back trouble's gone where'd it go it's gone how long will it take no no it's gone but i just now had it you just now did but you just now don't watch watch him keep moving he comes he says same sermon that's your daddy sitting next to you there you believe me to be god's prophet you do if god will tell me what your trouble will you believe me as his servant you have a kidney trouble is that right raise up your hand all right you don't have it now this is the gospel we're part of this is the reality that you're enjoying today in the holy ghost he keeps going watch he keeps going that's your son sitting there smiling that's right you believe you believe with all your heart you have trouble with your neck haven't you a broken neck you also have had rheumatic fever didn't you you don't have it now now do you believe lord jesus just have faith and believe you had it didn't you you don't have it now you have a prayer card you don't it's okay you don't need one it's over oh my friends and so so when when we talk about the devil and you know maybe the devil maybe you're here today and you say brother jason i'm in such a battle and and i guarantee if we polled a half a dozen people you'd have a half a dozen different kinds of battles for some people it might be some spirit of oppression troubling their mind and others it might be a physical ailment troubling their body and others it might be some financial calamity in their bank account for others it might be a lost child for others it you know whatever it could be whatever it could be i'm here to tell you that that that that the devil has if he's fought you for a while on any front on any front i i'm here to tell you i don't care what kind of fronts in fact is all fronts if you're here today and everything i just named you goes wow that's me i got all of them and he's fighting you with all of them and fighting you simultaneously how would you like to get rid of them in a moment in a moment say i've needed deliverance for a long time well have it right now say i've needed healing for a long time we'll take it right now it's yours he's a right now god this is the hour you don't have to back up from the devil come on you're the bride of jesus christ he died for you he ascended he gave back his life who does the devil think he's messing with there's power in the blood of jesus there's power in the name of the word of god all right now brother branham gives a beautiful example car lovers love this one where he talks about a shined up beautiful i think he uses a cadillac even and uh simoniz job and i guess that's an old-fashioned word for buffing and waxing i guess who's old brother luther does that mean never mind okay thank you sir i'd rather lose my buddy he's the one i can pick on he gives it back trust me [Laughter] yeah so so brother branham is shining up this car and my goodness it's got chrome everything and it's it's it's beautiful it's luxurious it's got a powerful engine it's got a tank full of gasoline it's it's ready and raring to go but in order for that car to serve any purpose other than eye candy you're gonna have to get in it turn the switch and there's gonna have to be a spark happen inside that combustion area to ignite that gasoline now that gasoline is loaded with power it is it it is extremely gasoline is extremely volatile and the fumes even the fumes can blow up so i understand it's very volatile substance it's filled with power unreleased you and brother branham says unless it gets a spark it might as well be water for all the good it would do you now that's true i could douse you in water i could douse you in gasoline you'd like the gas you'd like the water a lot better but you wouldn't be in any more danger as long as nobody comes around you with a match the gasoline can't release its power i mean water is is hydrogen oxygen it has power too but gasoline has an incredible amount of energy inside of its molecules and what happens is when a spark brother branham calls it now he talks about mechanics and dynamics and the mechanics are the word it's a car it's got wheels it's got a transmission got an engine it's got a tank full of gas and one place you know we go out here and we try to figure out do i need a you know 87 octane 89 90 throw on 93. brother brahm said he he in one place calls it this is a hundred octane another place he says it's a thousand octane another time he says it's ten thousand octane oh i i wrote a letter to brother uh uh brother doug baker and you know you you hear the old joke about somebody being a rocket scientist and you know i i've done that before one time you know when i was had a sermon i was going to preach and i was and brother branham called us astronauts and we're in the astronaut age and the and it's 10 000 octane you know and it's no it's not the horse and bugging it's not the car it's not the airplane we're blasting off and so i i needed some items in best buy and i walked in and i walked up to the counter i don't know what about me made them think to ask me these questions and uh seemed like i needed some some um a way to i was looking at a projector and some things i was gonna i said well i'm teaching a class and uh they said oh said what do you what do you what do you do for a living i said i'm a rocket scientist like four or five of those black shirts uh what do they call them you know at best buy i said now hold on i'm a spiritual rocket scientist they were like what's that but brother doug baker is actually a real rocket scientist and so you know he he's the real deal and so i wrote to him uh yesterday and asked him about what's what's with this 10 000 octane uh brother doug is that rocket fuel how is that working and he gave me this long little you know scientific which i love that kind of stuff he gave me this long scientific paper and he kept apologizing i'm sorry to go so far he said but the only way to explain is to explain it all and i'm like i love it keep it coming got a whole sermon out of it i'm going to preach amen amen and so so so we find that this that this word that you have in this day is a hundred no a thousand no ten thousand octane it's got a lot of power but it's gotta have a spark so brother branham now in god's provided place of worship he says here all right he says now and that's what's the matter with the church today we're full of theology without any dynamics in it that's right see in other words you've got to have a spark to the gasoline or the gasoline is no more than it's it's not even as good as water as long as it hasn't got the spark of fire to it now that's a true statement you can't drink it it can't save your life unless you're gonna burn gasoline it's a it's a worthless element it has no value but to stink up your garage and contaminate your driveway and get on your hands you got to go wash them it's dangerous the fumes are dangerous unless unless you're going to put it in a gasoline-fired engine and use it it's worthless so they send their preachers to bible study for years and years and years and they fill up their tank with gasoline and it's you know it's it's not pure gasoline but at least it's gasoline they they can get something out of it the problem is they never get a spark and so all it does is stink up a church and stink up people's lives and nobody's ever cleaned because they're just getting doused in gasoline i don't want any dousing gasoline give me the water of the word put up put a put a flame to it and i'm here to tell you you got a 10 000 octane something that'll take that vehicle down the road it'll cause the blind to see it'll cause the death to hear the lame to walk it'll cause the loss to get saved it'll give the holy ghost to your children and your family it'll cast out devils we're going to tell you some friend this word i've said it to you so many times god didn't send a prophet his seventh and last star just to fill your head full of gasoline it's not about greater theology it's about a life we're part of a kingdom a kingdom of priests a kingdom of saints a kingdom of christ's a kingdom of messiahs hallelujah so he says it has to have a spark as long as it hasn't got the spark of fog to fire it so that's the way so now so now dynamic power let me get caught up to myself here all right so now so when we talk about dynamic power now watch this there is a dynamic power to disappear this bride you understand that there is a dynamic power upon the word and brother branham said when the when the dynamics come on the mechanics that you're feeding on dynamics hit that then mechanics become dynamics so in other words the word that you are feeding upon turns you into the fire that ignites you the fire that ignites you is jesus christ so what does it turn you into misses jesus christ amen that's not just fancy language that's not just you know lofty thinking that's reality so there is enough dynamic power now in this word that we have to literally disappear a bride around the world in a moment in an instant in the blink of an eye power's not the problem power's not the problem the gasoline got loads of power locked up in it the fire of the holy ghost is not not the problem god's not lacking in what he has for this church what the problem in too many of god's children and hear me as i'm calling you god's children because what makes you a child of god because you're a christian no that's only when you found out you already were you understand you didn't become a christian you found out you just started cooperating in the vision when you got born again so we find out that that what is missing in too many children of god is a personal experience with the source of the fire a personal experience we feel revelation of the word and a lot of times people end up in a place of false security sons and daughters of god sit in message churches sometimes for years sometimes decades they believe the word they believe the teachings and they have a gene of god they listen peter understood who jesus was because of the gene of god long before he ever got the new birth i understand that gene was enough to recognize you're the christ the son of the living god and jesus says blessed art thou simon you know you no man told you that god gave you that so there's lots of people with god-given understanding of prophecy peter was understanding a modern event made clear this was the word that was prophesied to come and stand in a human being virgin born and be the son of god and peter connected the dots and said you're the one he still wasn't converted and sometimes we we we feel that because we have a a revelation of the word and we say i have a a gene seed of god and i agree with the teachings of the message but clearly clearly it's more than that and it must be more than that the message of the hour is not doctrine it's a person of christ the word and it's got to become a reality in your heart and when it does it becomes something something that you you you to you personally that that that's far more than agreement with doctrine the new birth becomes so much more than that to you it's more than just agreement with doctrine it it it was always to be a personal thing of revelation when you come into contact with christ and and and while listen the experience of the new birth while it often can affect you and often does and you hear testimonies from people say i i got the holy ghost and this happened to me in this sensation i shouted dance ran screamed loved everybody for two weeks and felt dizzy and i mean there's all kinds of things that can happen all of it be perfectly god doing it see but you got to understand it's always got to be something personal to you while it can have often have an effect affect you physically in profound profound physical ways it's i want to say it like this it's beyond physical amen it's more real than physical physical is such a shallow way to think of the new birth some physical emotion or sensation this is something that's more real than physical and that's why it has always been folly to to to label it as any describable physical experience see because it's deeper than that it's deeper than something i can feel it's something deeper than you can even explain you know it's there it's hard to put into words only a person who has had the same experience says i get it they don't even have to pass words you just go you know there's that yeah oh it's changed my whole life and and and people around you start going oh tears start rolling they're not even one telling the story and they're crying listening to yours because they're remembering their experience this is something that brother branham was talking about how it's missing and and so so it's something that's deeper than you can even explain and and hence brother branham's description of it as a personal revelation a personal revelation uh a a it's a it's a reality of happening within you that is so profound it changes you into a brand new person that's not a light statement brother branham called you a brand new unit paul said old things are passed away all things have become new i'm not here to put something as a carrot so far out there you just sit here and say man i can never attain that you probably have more attained it than you even are aware of and the devil's got you you know afraid because you got this weakness or that weakness but tell me about your heart tell me about your love for god and your love for his word tell me how that you don't want to sin anymore i'll start to tell you about the holy ghost tell me you wanna you love righteousness and you love purity and you regret your weaknesses now you're starting to get to an experience friends brother branham says here in christ is the mystery i i don't have it on the slide i i added it later after i was completed with the powerpoint brother branham says what is the new birth then you say well brother branham what is the new birth now i'm going to read this quotes to you upside down because i'm going to read you what he said after something he said that i'm going to read you second does that make sense well brother branham what is the new birth it's the revelation of jesus christ personally to you see not you joined a church you shook a hand you done something different you said a creed you promised to live by a coat of rules but christ the bible he is the word that was revealed to you and no matter what anybody says what takes place it's christ pastor priest whatever it might be it's christ in you that is the revelation that the church was built on now he says further or prior look christ in you so here here say well then okay bring it down and give me some brass tacks so that i can have a north star somewhere i need to get my bearings on my spiritual condition all right i'm going to do that for you christ in you makes him the center of life of the revelation say i got a revelation of this message well let's look at your life and i'll give you a doctor's opinion i'm a spiritual doctor and i'll give you my my spiritual medical opinion on whether or not you've got what you think you have if you have a real revelation of this message that's not doctrinal theology that's a an intimate relationship with the person of the word see and what it does is it makes him the center of the life of the revelation see christ's life in you makes him the center of the revelation christ in the bride makes the bible the complete revelation of christ that's a strange statement christ in the bride listen to what he says christ in the bible all right makes the bib christ in the bible makes the bible um let me back up in the center of the revelation all right here it is christ in the bible makes the bible the complete revelation of christ christ in you makes you the complete revelation of the whole thing then you see what god is trying to do so the whole validity of the bible is the fact that you're it amen so why does why do i validate the bible because you were born a sinner and you had no way to be this and when you suddenly are this and this comes off the page and starts getting written behind skin and you start living it it you validate this that's that's the dynamics on the mechanics that's a kingdom that's a church with authority see all right let me go to my next slide uh this one all right it's not sh witching oh there we go beautiful okay no matter what watch no matter how well we're taught how well we'll believe and how much can't you read along with me and how much of the bible that we say is true and we believe it all true it's got to be the dynamics has got to be there the spark to set that word of fire and make it start rolling that's the whole purpose i have in a car and i ain't got a car i'm not jay leno i i can't fill a garage full of cars i can go stare at i got to have a truck because i got to drive i don't want to walk to walmart i don't want to go to walmart at all but i don't want to walk anywhere i go i got to have a truck the purpose of having it the reason i pay payments on it is because i'm going to use it god didn't put you here as just a trophy bride you're here to be a kingdom of christ you're not you're you're you're when you're sitting on a cell on the hill as a light that that's an activity that's not you to stand up there with a smile on your face that's the life of the word living out of you because the life is the light of men hallelujah if there's no life there's no light see so so he says it's got to put the word of fire and make it start rolling it's got to have that if you don't the church sits still the car sits still you'll sit still i don't want to sit still i don't want a church that sets steel i don't want a kingdom i don't want to be a part of a kingdom that's set still come on we're marching to zion you got a purpose for being here i challenge you today to accept the purpose of god in your life and say today jesus make me the perfect vision of every purpose you have in my life no matter who no matter how much you say i sympathize i believe every word of that you've got to have something to spark that off to make that 100 octane go to firing and the big church of god go to moving on it's got to take the dynamics with the mechanics nothing wrong with the mechanics but lacking dynamics as a pastor quite naturally i'm sure that you would understand that my concern very naturally is that is that you have that supernatural spark to ignite the word the gasoline that you say you believe in that you're feeding on first of all you're going to need to feed on it if you want to have anything to ignite carr can man that electronic ignition can be firing every one of them spark plugs firing all the wires everything hitting good but you ain't got no gasoline in that tank you ain't going nowhere you ain't gonna get it running you're going to be pushing it why would i push a car i can drive say well that'd be crazy well then then which then then look at our lives and say sometimes we just have to listen friends sometimes you got to be honest enough to go man look at that man the mirror and go man you're crazy here you are pushing your way through life when you got a perfect engine and gasoline and a spark and this thing could take off and pass everybody amen what do we want as a church bethel tabernacle those of you here those of you who are streaming at home the the other half of the alphabet what is it we want friends i'm here to tell you i want a fire breathing church i want something that can burn the robber i want something that can go down the track and beat everybody else i want to set new speed records i want to do something for the kingdom of god i don't want to sit still hallelujah i don't want to get comfortable we get so comfortable laodicea is designed to cuddle you rub you caress you go to sleep little baby why why so he can destroy your life so he can invade your home there's no strong man there see so as a pastor my concern naturally then is that you have that supernatural spark to ignite the gasoline you're feeding on i'm not okay i'm not okay brother jason is not okay with you just having a tank full of gas i appreciate the ministry of this church it fills up your tank let me tell you something friends god has gifted bethel tabernacle with some incredible ministry preaching teaching encouraging strengthening devil casting out preaching we've got that here but i'm not satisfied with you just having a tank full of gas and no spark to turn mechanics into dynamics here's another quote i don't have a slide for but i want to use it it is the rising of the sun but oh i'm so glad that there is a 10 000 octane power the word of god and the holy ghost to light it up but brother jason i thought that you have told us the seed gene is the trump card of it all and it's all election by origin and if i've got to see gene of god listen friends the devil would love to side track you with that very valid argument that's a very true argument that's a truth in the scripture all all the father hath given me will come to me that's not the issue here i'm talking about being able to get in jesus being able to get in his car and go down the road you understand i'm not talking about you getting into heaven that's john's already saw it you're gonna be there i'm talking about the lord jesus saying i need to run an errand i need a truck real quick oh there's one right there and drop right down into me or drop right down into you i did there there's there's a there's a young person at that school and i i need a car real quick that i can drive up those hallways and go witness to her oh there's a young lady who's a christian who loves me i'll go get in her and i'll go witness to that sinner hallelujah friend you think that's fairy tales that's how god operates that's how he operates he's looking every day to be a witness through his family why i heard the testimony sister needham brother ken and and the persecution they're come on they've come under and and and and jesus always went to stuff like that brother branham was the most criticized paul was the most criticized to this day people hate paul's so bad they they criticize him 2000 years after he died come on you think they're not going to go after william branham he's only been gone 50 some years they go after paul he's been gone 2 000 years and they still go after him still call him a woman hater still say he it was a hostile takeover of the church and he was a secret sinner oh there's a website against william brano every one of you bring me i'll show you five against jesus bring me bring me one of william branham i'll show you two or three about christianity and the apostle paul that what's what's new about that's not original that's not new that's just dummies who don't want it to be true too bad it is it's got 10 000 octane so so you know this whole idea of the seed gene of god and this is exactly why you know so many too many say how many too many you know who are actual seed gene children of god they were born that way some of them have already made their way into message churches have already been baptized and have all already believing and already got tanks full of gasoline and never have had the spark that could give the car power so that jesus could drive around in their life never live to the potential of god's vision for them say is that possible yup they did an article i read recently i thought it was astonishing brother branham deals with this that's how i knew how credible it was brother branham talks about uh brother sheridan and they were breeding cattle and and brother branham brother brown he said you know i'm i'm against all that inner breeding kind of stuff we ought to leave nature the way nature is he was against hybrid anything and so he brother branham talks about that in the in the breeding of bulls and he said i've i've looked under the microscope to see the the male seed how it fertilizes the egg and brother branham talks about one in a million you're familiar with that so so we find then just let me give you some some science here there there are about 40 million as a minimum to 1.2 billion male sperm cells in a discharge so when they're breeding these cattle and and this is a this is every animal this is from human to cattle to monkeys to everything these these numbers all line out and there's about anywhere from 40 million to 1.2 billion that comes from that bull and there it's released with every discharge now watch this watch these numbers 40 million to 1.2 billion in the discharge yet only 2 million of these persistent swimmers actually reach the cervix for the 2 million seed that inner the female cervix around one million actually make it to the uterus for the one million cells that actually reach the uterus only about 10 000 make it to the top of the uterus for the 10 000 cells that make it to this point only around half of them actually go in the right direction heading to the egg cell for the nearly 5 thousand seed that make it to the utero tubal junction only around one thousand of these reach the inside of the fallopian tube for the one thousand that enter the tube only around 200 are actually reach the egg in the end only one cell out of this group of 200 actually penetrates and fertilizes the egg and brother branham is saying you're talking about one in a million that was child's place one in 40 million to 1.2 billion and one and it just keeps reducing keeps reducing keeps reducing people people hate election by origin but you can see it in nature and so the magic of conception then then then you've got the whole time because the magic of conception this is why an animal breeding you see that's where brother brown said the fall of a of a human female animal that that was part of that shows that she fell from grace because she can have that act all the time but in nature it's not like that in nature you you can have the bulls and the cows you can have the dogs and the female dogs running around the yard it won't matter but if one of them comes in heat you better put somebody up and we find that that it can only happen you know during this time and and in this certain week uh once once that has once that act has happened and and you you get survivability rates and i don't want to get too deep into the science of this but i want to i want to read this so the male cells are capable of surviving more than six days in the female body research has shown that the research has shown that visible visible that you can see with your naked eye under a microscope that visible zinc sparks are released along with calcium levels at the time of fertilization when that one in a million when that one in 40 million to 1.2 billion gets in the egg and fertilizes it zinc sparks are released along with calcium levels and this fertilization releases a flash of light and according to scientists the size of the zinc sparks the zinc spark determines the eggs the egg's ability to grow and into a healthy embryo and here brother branham is saying here we got plenty of mechanics but without a spark without a flash of light say what is the holy ghost it's a flash of life because life is the light halloween god is even testifying in nature itself you have every mechanical part of a son of god as a gene as a seed gene of god you've got every mechanical part as a son of god from the foundation of the world but you still have to have that supernatural experience there has to sparks have to fly it has to be a light that is seen hallelujah if it's something in the natural you can better believe it's in the spiritual and i want to know that i've had the spark i want to know i've had the flesh of light i want to know that i have conceived in me the life of the lord jesus christ why do i need that to unlock all that power all that power to do what i listen friends oh power to power to move mountains power to speak storms i don't need to go to palestine and move a mountain to fulfill jesus words i don't have to stand on a mount in colorado to to speak a storm out of existence how about i speak to the mountains and storms in my life how about we have enough fire and spark and light on the word of god to have the holy ghost take over our homes and our lives unlocking the power to live out the portion of the word to live out the portion to live out to live out the portion of the word for your day brother branham says here in the ever pro wow i'm gonna i'm gonna wrap up here right brother branham says i just got a few quotes i wanna i wanna get you these quotes and we'll stop ever present water from the rock says tell them repent and be baptized in the name of jesus christ for the remission of their sins and these signs shall follow them that believe now you're back on the road back to the same water the same water will give the same refreshments it will give the same scourge to the body it will it'll give the same cleansing power it'll give the same healing power it'll do the same thing it did then if we'll only get back to the same spirit now do you think that's poetic license or brother branham just trying to be like walt disney and make you feel good or is that the word of god see watch next slide all right let me get to the next one now i love this watch life in a grapevine will bring forth grapes you know why that's true because genesis said every seed to bring forth of its kind if it did last year it'll bring the same this year that's the law of god the law of god is that if this is a grapevine leave it alone it'll produce grapes see if you have the real spark of life in you i can pretty much leave you alone if i had a whole church with everybody with the spark and the gasoline on fire you know i wouldn't have to preach against sin at all i could just stand here and we could talk about the glories of god and every time a devil poked his head in the back door we bash him and he and he would get tired of coming around amen that's that's a book of acts church that's what i'm after that's what's promised to us in this last day amen a promise of the return of that church so he says you can interbreed it with something else while it's on my mind matt that looks perfect but this and that are not they're not correct that and that's perfect in framing so just just a note to self so watch what he says you can interbreed it with something else but then leave it alone and it'll come right back to the same grapes again next one watch he says so we've interbred the church with pentecostalism i love this term baptistism methodism presbyterianism with anglicanism and every other kind of an ism why don't you leave it alone come back to the vine it'll come back to the same power amen amen i i he says amen amen i like that now so we can talk about the fact that you know if i if i took this segment of my sermon i would speak to people who have had an experience of the holy ghost but who have grown cold coveted has went a long way into making some people cold see how about if i add to pentecostal baptist methodist presbyterian anglicanism and all the other isms how about we add this one not to add to brother branham but we could add easily worldlyism carnalism see and so this this is my concern for revival because i know that the promise of the word of god is we have the bride's revival and these elements and things that are happening in the world ought not to be taking us down these are the times when it's time to rise up and excel to have complete victory over the enemy that this demon of covet i'm gonna tell you something friends if you think about this i was talking about wayne lawson the other day he was he was reciting this it's so inspiring that this covet brother wayne said brother jason he said i see this covet as a demon of separation isn't it funny how the devil's tried since the days of the prophet even brother branham warning the church he said now you're one great big happy sweet group now but remember my warning say well let it stay that way even if he has to bring somebody in uh an imposter and inject them with a poison they'll start running through the church and and don't you side with it remember that love that brother pray for him he'll either come in or go out become one of you or leave and and satan has always been trying and he's been very successful splitting churches splitting families splitting marriages are all in the name of the message of the hour under the authority of the king's word taking the misinterpreting the scriptures and and and breaking away and then they're against this one and then you've got a split and then there's a division and satan but you know that the beauty of it is the true church of god that true pure bread body of christ with the holy ghost has weathered every one of those i've been raised up in this thing i've been in church splits i've seen church splits you're not going to see more and have more experience than me my parents were in the meetings i was born in it i've been raised in it i've i i've lived at numerous places i've lived in the north i've lived in the south i've lived in the deep south i've been around the world i'm here to tell you the bride of jesus christ just just surmounts every time that happens she just steps over it and keeps on walking every time somebody rises up with the camp and people get pulled aside the bride of christ stays right on the word and even sometimes some of them come out of that and go what was i thinking yeah what were you thinking come on back let me let me let me wash you up real quick okay now you're just fine hallelujah friends that's the power of the word of god now here we are we've got a we've got an affliction that's going around the world and satan has been able to divide us literally only half this congregation can even be here at any given service not saying we're not well i'm not saying we're going to stop doing that i'm just saying you know we we've got our thinking on that i've covered it thoroughly we want to see it end but we're trying to provide the right kind of testimony we found a way to work around it so we're working around it but you know if you just think about it for a second what is one of the best ways sometimes as a preacher brother wayne and i were talking about this and relating man that is so true i've had that happen he said yeah me too yeah so many times in a church you start preaching and and yeah you ever wonder why brother jason is like kooky on making you turn on shake hands you think that's just my ocd do you know i do that around the world you know why i do it because it breaks the breaks the power of devils because you reach out and you take another believer by the hand we we got to bind our faith what do we do we say lay your hands on one another we we we gather up here around the the pulpit how many times for years i say no don't stand in the aisles get up in here tight do we need this we need this bonfire to be big we can't even do any of that now i can't even turn around i can say shake hands within your family and just give a virtual shake to everybody else and wave at them this covet has been a literal separate it's been the most successful way that satan's been able to literally separate us and i'll tell you something friends he's separated a lot of people from coming to the house of god and it's affecting lives it's affecting lives it's i'm going to tell you something friends if you are at home and afraid of covid shame on you cast that thing down believe in the power of god we've got we've got distancing here we wear mask here we got hand sanitizers here i'm here to tell you satan has pulled one and i'm here to say we're not we're not going to violate the the ordinance but i i just believe that that we got to come to grips and say i need more of god i need more of the holy ghost i need a fresh fire that's what bethel tabernacle needs that's what i'm preaching about i want us to be the anointed kingdom the anointed kingdom where the devil has no way to get a foothold we need a revival meeting i've been trying to brainstorm how can i have a revival meeting i don't know man i've thought about putting a big old ginormous tent out here they say you know if you're outdoors that's why they say you know protesters they can get out there because they're outdoors okay fine we'll put a big old tent so we'll all be outdoors and if they let them do it outdoors they got to let us do it outdoors amen i'd like to run about 10 nights in a big tent revival out here i'd show them what to what the what the world needs we'd bring in some gospel revival preachers in here and we'd blow this place up hallelujah friends that's what i want i want to see the power of god moving we're almost home the devil's raging i want to see the power of the living god moving among us it's promised to us it's promised to us let me finish up here i think i got three more slides yeah three more exactly watch let's stop with these still gotcha i need not that one i need that one the future home of the heavenly bridegroom and the earthly bride just like all the curse of sin is gone when the holy ghost accepts you you don't accept it it accepts you see because it's god's attribute see if it's the holy ghost means god's spirit and it's the attribute the thought of god has accepted you because you were ordained for that purpose so you've got a gene of god you are one in 40 million to 1.2 billion but you still got to have the spark you got the ma you got the gasoline you got the gene of god but you still got to be born again see to release the power in the word he goes on next slide he says yet you was born in sin so you ordained for that purpose yet you were born in sin but god had that attribute and here you expressed yourself here on earth and he comes down and gets you see you're back here and here is where you belong sin has lost its power could i say to you today that's where you belong where brother jason do i belong in here do i belong in beaufort do i belong in another state you but you you belong where sin has lost its power and wherever you're ever your g your geographical location is matters not that matters way less than that you dwell where sin is not see and so so he says you're in where you belong see sin has lost its power that's right the desire of sin has done gone from your heart when the holy spirit comes in you are a restored person and then when the earth is restored by the same thing there can be no more cursing no more storms no more winds no more typhoons you are reconciled man and god has met the new earth will be put on its eden beauty again the new earth will spread forth her uh after her baptism of fire listen friends let me give you a a a word of encouragement let me leave you on an encouraging note sin will not stop the earth from changing back to its original condition thank god i i i look in the news headlines and i just have to look away i try to read oh i'm so sick of it i'm so sick of it it's so twisted it's so perverted everybody hates everybody everybody's lying good causes have been hijacked by bad causes and and and things and and insanity and chaos in the streets i'm i'm done with it and i want to i want to live on another planet you know the planet i want to live on i want to go live on planet jesus and the prophet said you've got enough power in you to speak a world into existence and go live there i intend to speak planet jesus into existence and i intend to live there i'm tired of this world i want his world i want his life and i don't care all the chaos all the lies all the nonsense i don't care who wins the president i don't care who does what when where or how it's not going to stop what john saw john saw it he said it's real i saw it hallelujah why brother jason why did why can it not be stopped for the same reason you can't be stopped because it's god's attribute the new world is part of his attribute you're part of his attribute this earth is part of his attribute do you do you think friends for a moment when god had the earth standing and and it was darkness covered the face of the deep there was no garden of eden there was no trees nothing darkness covered the face of the deep and the sun was already there and the seed was already in the earth but in between was this thick dark blackness and it was cutting off the rays of light all it needed was to strike the earth clear back the water and strike the seed and life would come forth because life was in the seed and you know i think in all of that chaos we look today and say man it's chaos it's darkness it's terrible how's the how's the light of god's sunlight how is the is the rising of the sun and we we say that until it becomes almost a cliche what does it really mean brother jason i'm here to tell you something friends no more than the chaos of that earth when god said let there be light he wasn't creating a sun and he wasn't creating seed he was speaking to that darkness and i when i think about that i wrote my own self this question do you really think that god looked at that darkness standing between the sun and the seed and said who how will i get this seed to match my vision of it as a flourishing plant i see it as a flourishing plant how am i ever going to get there i'm here to tell you something friends that darkness couldn't stop it you know why light as brother graham said light is 10 million times more powerful than darkness all you need all you need today say brother jason sum it up give me my one piece of advice before you send me home my one piece of advice brother anthony bring your team and come on back my one piece of advice is this come away from darkness and stand in the light stand think about your life friends think about where your life is do you stand in the darkness as a seed gene of god you're a christian where are you standing think about that seriously now for a moment i want you to think real seriously because you know there i i have because there's been a spark i have the ability to stand in the light say brother jason i've had that same spark too well good then stand in the light stand in the light come out of the darkness move into the light because look brother branham you know you know why i read that quote about the grapevine it was so beautiful to me because brother branham is saying look the life in the vine is great life and maybe you've did all kinds of things and covered it and hybrid it and everything but if you just leave it alone and let it come back to nature it'll come back to bearing grapes again you know i don't know what's happened in your life i don't know exactly where you might be standing today you say brother jason i've been a part of this and it has made me cold i got too involved in this and it made me carnal i got to i'm a christian brother jason i'm a believer i believe the word i've had the spark i've got the spark of life i know i love the lord but you know this happened to me and i did indulge in that and i got this and this is in my home and i did i allowed that and i shouldn't have oh brother jason i i got no light my my life is chaos and darkness stop just stop just stop just get away from all that stuff it'll come back to life again just move away from it this sermon today isn't complicated move away from the darkness move into light the grapevine if you just leave it alone quit feeding it the poisons of laodicea the seed gene in you will start growing god again do you believe that it'll start growing god again move back into the light move back into your bibles move back into the tapes move back into church services move back into prayer stop being chased by the world stop being afraid of the chaos claim your hill claim your mountain claim your land take it back today don't wait for another service don't wait for me to finish this sermon claim it right now take the bloodstained banner and put it on that on that mountaintop just like mount sarabachi they put that flag you know what that flag was saying we own this mountain we fought we ran the enemy off of it and we own it and we ain't ever giving it back hallelujah why don't you bow your heads with me over the building whatever is your choice brother anthony or brother andrew whatever you'd like to play let's let's just bow our heads for a moment thank you lord thank you for your grace thank you for your love your kindness all that you have meant to us lord this day you have delivered your word i know it was you lord i

the darkness and come into the light look over your life child of god why don't you bring that seed of god out of the darkness into light if you do that you won't have to make it grow you won't have to beg it and struggle it'll just grow it's got zoe life in it just give it the light give it the gasoline give it the spark let that represent your whole life say today today lord today i'm taking
