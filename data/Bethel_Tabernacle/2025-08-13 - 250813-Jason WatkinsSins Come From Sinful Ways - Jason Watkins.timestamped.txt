[0:00] regimes. They routinely practice
[0:03] especially they they practice uh
[0:06] breaking the rules of international war
[0:09] when they feel that no one is watching.
[0:12] Under the third Geneva Convention,
[0:15] prisoners of war are uh are entitled.
[0:19] They must be treated humanely at all
[0:22] times. They must be protected from
[0:24] violence, intimidation,
[0:27] insults, public curiosity, and they must
[0:30] have access to medical care and contact
[0:33] with their families.
[0:36] &gt;&gt; That's actually the third Geneva
[0:38] Convention concerning prisoners of war.
[0:41] But rogue actors who ignore these rules,
[0:44] and history is replete with this, tend
[0:47] to violate the most basic floor of
[0:49] protection anytime there's war. Because
[0:52] the thought is, well, all's fair in war
[0:55] and there's no rules to war.
[0:58] the common article three uh by employing
[1:03] it goes on to say by employing
[1:05] prohibited acts they often employ
[1:08] prohibited acts such as torture cruel
[1:10] treatment hostage taking outrages upon
[1:14] personal dignit dignity in plain terms
[1:18] captives can face beatings electric
[1:20] shock stress positions sexual violence
[1:24] mock executions and deliberate
[1:27] humiliation. They can be denied medical
[1:30] care, adequate food or sleep, held in
[1:33] incommunicado
[1:35] and threatened even with harm to their
[1:38] families
[1:40] &gt;&gt; who are not even captured.
[1:44] Now the world, it's true, the world has
[1:46] gone after and actually have have
[1:49] prosecuted in in world courts and and I
[1:52] and I I remember when the the war was
[1:55] going on there in Serbia and and
[1:57] Herzgoina and those different places and
[1:59] and um and they and there was a very
[2:02] cruel dictator who was guilty of great
[2:05] atrocities of war and they actually
[2:07] captured him and tried him and put him
[2:10] in prison after it was all settled.
[2:12] Bosnia, Herziggoina and uh Serbians and
[2:15] different ones uh going on down in that
[2:17] war there in the Baltic states and and
[2:20] when they commit such acts it's it's
[2:23] really you say wow you know so so they
[2:27] they finally got what's coming to them
[2:29] and I and I will say this that they
[2:31] ought to get what's coming to them
[2:33] &gt;&gt; if justice is to be served and and what
[2:36] I would call righteous justice uh you
[2:40] know I I we realize that that even
[2:42] brother Brandham talks about being
[2:44] against capital punishment. He said even
[2:46] even God did not execute Cain. He put a
[2:49] mark on him. But I'm going to here to
[2:50] tell you something friends uh that
[2:52] desperate times can call for desperate
[2:55] measures. And when you have people who
[2:59] refuse to follow civilized law, very
[3:01] often times more often than we would
[3:04] like to imagine and far more often than
[3:08] than police force and military forces
[3:12] are forced to actually end someone's
[3:14] life,
[3:15] &gt;&gt; right?
[3:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:16] &gt;&gt; And they have no choice. Many times it's
[3:18] in the defense of their own life or to
[3:21] save and protect the lives of others or
[3:23] to turn back an invading force. We find
[3:27] that Samuel put Aag to death in that
[3:29] very same way when Saul had spared him.
[3:32] And and here was a man that was guilty
[3:34] of horrible genocidal acts against uh
[3:38] against the Jews. And Samuel immediately
[3:41] slaughtered him and told him that he was
[3:44] being killed for all the sons that he
[3:48] had robbed the Jewish mothers of.
[3:53] &gt;&gt; So this is only when justice and
[3:58] righteous judgment are put into effect.
[4:01] Too often unfortunately we don't see
[4:04] equality of action uh when persons um
[4:09] you know if I would say it like this
[4:11] sometimes there are persons and they're
[4:14] somewhat influential or nations that are
[4:18] too influ influential and or businesses
[4:21] that are too big to let them fail.
[4:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:27] &gt;&gt; Isaiah 59, brother Josh. Isaiah 59:14-18
[4:35] the Bible says here and judgment God
[4:38] speaking this was this this was God
[4:41] speaking about you know no justice and
[4:43] no uh equity and and no fair judgment 59
[4:49] 14 to 18 verse 14 and judgment is turned
[4:53] away backwards excuse my voice I'm not
[4:55] sure what's going on but
[4:58] it's All good. I'll preach right through
[5:00] it and blow it out and then it'll work.
[5:04] &gt;&gt; Verse 14. Judgment is turned away
[5:07] backward, and justice standeth a far
[5:10] off. For truth is fallen in the street,
[5:13] and equity cannot enter. Yay, truth
[5:16] faileth, and he that departeth from evil
[5:19] maketh himself a prey. So good people
[5:22] get killed. See,
[5:25] &gt;&gt; and the Lord saw it, and it displeased
[5:28] him that there was no judgment. And he
[5:31] saw that there was no man, and wondered
[5:34] that there was no intercessor.
[5:37] Therefore, his arm brought salvation
[5:39] unto him, and his righteousness it
[5:42] sustained him.
[5:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[5:45] &gt;&gt; For he put on righteousness as a
[5:47] breastplate, and a helmet of salvation
[5:50] upon his head. And he put on the
[5:53] garments of vengeance for clothing and
[5:55] was clad with zeal as a cloak. According
[5:58] to their deeds, accordingly he will
[6:01] repay fury to his adversaries,
[6:04] recompense to his enemies. To the
[6:07] islands he will repay recompense.
[6:15] When we talk about
[6:18] going into a battle unprepared and
[6:20] you're either going to be annihilated or
[6:22] you're going to be taken as a prisoner
[6:24] of war and you can see that in the
[6:28] natural and as I even as I have taken
[6:31] these first 15 minutes just to lay out
[6:34] that very natural picture I've drawn in
[6:37] your mind.
[6:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[6:39] &gt;&gt; And you all agree with me in the
[6:41] natural. No, I wouldn't I wouldn't go to
[6:44] war against a highly trained, highly
[6:46] skilled, highly conditioned, heavily
[6:49] armed enemy with no weapons and no
[6:51] training and no conditioning. I wouldn't
[6:53] do that because naturally I'd either get
[6:55] killed very quickly or I'd be taken a
[6:57] prisoner of war very quickly and it
[6:59] might be a rogue nation.
[7:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[7:02] &gt;&gt; But why is it that we would imagine that
[7:06] it would be any different in spiritual
[7:08] war? Amen.
[7:12] &gt;&gt; I'll ask you this another question
[7:14] tonight. Got a number of questions I
[7:15] want to put to you and present.
[7:18] Which kind of war
[7:21] would be of greater concern to you that
[7:24] you had to fight in? A natural war where
[7:27] you had to face bullets and tanks and
[7:29] jets and missiles where you had to face
[7:32] drones and could be killed silently by a
[7:35] sniper. Would you would you have greater
[7:37] concern to fight that natural war or a
[7:41] spiritual war?
[7:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[7:45] &gt;&gt; It's a good question, don't you think?
[7:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[7:51] &gt;&gt; But Jesus says
[7:54] in Matthew 10:28,
[7:56] "Fear not them which kill the body,
[8:01] &gt;&gt; but are not able to kill the soul."
[8:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. but rather fear him which is
[8:07] able to destroy both soul and body in
[8:12] hell.
[8:14] &gt;&gt; See,
[8:18] &gt;&gt; you know,
[8:20] we serve at the pleasure of the king.
[8:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[8:24] &gt;&gt; He's been a king for a long time. He's
[8:27] the king of heaven, the king of earth,
[8:29] and the king of the universe. In fact,
[8:32] he's the king of all men. He's not only
[8:34] the God of good men, he's the God of all
[8:35] men. He leads men at his choosing. And
[8:39] he has a way that he has worked with
[8:42] humanity down through the centuries.
[8:46] You know, if you were part of a
[8:50] natural army and you were able to walk
[8:54] in the ranks of the best army in the
[8:56] world with the best commanding generals
[8:59] and the best under under the generals of
[9:03] command staff uh that are under the
[9:05] generals and men who had winning records
[9:10] in battle, men who had been leading
[9:13] successful assaults and defensive
[9:15] maneuvers for decades.
[9:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[9:20] &gt;&gt; I present to you tonight in a spiritual
[9:22] war that God had generals.
[9:26] &gt;&gt; And God has a command staff. And he
[9:29] calls his command staff a five-fold
[9:31] ministry. And he called his generals the
[9:33] seven spirits of God that would anoint
[9:36] seven stars in his right hand that would
[9:39] be sent to the earth to receive a
[9:41] message to spread forth the carcass of
[9:43] the word so the eagles could gather. And
[9:45] it causes great spiritual warfare when
[9:48] he does that.
[9:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[9:52] this five-fold ministry. I mean, this
[9:54] command staff that you had the privilege
[9:57] to serve under, they had real chops and
[10:00] they'd proven themselves in battle for
[10:03] many years. And their their top priority
[10:06] was to throttle the enemy daily. And
[10:09] their top priority to serve the king was
[10:12] to drive Satan off of kingdoms lands
[10:16] while keeping you alive.
[10:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[10:21] So when I come back full circle and I
[10:23] say it all like that, I come back to my
[10:25] original two of my questions. Why would
[10:28] you imagine for a moment that that
[10:32] natural war would be different than
[10:34] spiritual war or spiritual war might be
[10:37] different than natural war? And the
[10:40] second one was which kind of war would
[10:43] be of greater threat or greater concern?
[10:46] I think I have convinced you by the
[10:48] words of Christ. I don't care about
[10:50] missiles, drones, and all that. I'm not
[10:52] saying they don't matter. I'm just
[10:54] saying all that could do is take your
[10:56] body.
[10:57] &gt;&gt; And Jesus said, "Don't fear the one who
[10:59] can take your body, but fear the one who
[11:01] can take both body and soul and destroy
[11:03] you in hell." Cuz there's no coming back
[11:05] from that.
[11:10] &gt;&gt; So, let me ask you one last time,
[11:12] natural spiritual warfare, which is the
[11:14] greater threat? Amen.
[11:20] &gt;&gt; I don't want to put you on edge, but I
[11:24] just want to say from my heart
[11:27] that if you thought
[11:29] that or if you think that natural
[11:33] warfare
[11:35] was the more deadly and the greater
[11:37] concern, then that might just explain
[11:39] why you lose so many spiritual battles.
[11:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. So often
[11:47] might explain how that you are
[11:50] if you think that the natural battle is
[11:53] of greater threat than the spiritual
[11:56] battle
[11:58] then uh you know I would say that you
[12:00] are probably lucky or rather than lucky
[12:04] you're you're blessed to even be still
[12:06] in the game only it's not a game.
[12:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[12:10] It's your daily life
[12:13] and you've got a choice in this
[12:15] spiritual warfare
[12:17] and God has control over your life. But
[12:22] I'm here to tell you something, friends.
[12:24] Your daily spiritual life in a spiritual
[12:29] prisoner of war camp of a rogue devil is
[12:33] no way to live a Christian life.
[12:37] you're cut off from home and all the
[12:41] things that you love most. And that's
[12:42] what the devil does.
[12:44] The devil will take families and he'll
[12:47] he'll raise up a a a child in that
[12:50] family and they become a teenager and
[12:52] the next thing you know, hear me well,
[12:53] teenagers. Next thing you know, they're
[12:55] flirting with the world and they're
[12:56] going out. I'm here to tell you, you're
[12:59] marching to a prisoner of war camp. And
[13:01] when the devil puts you in it and slams
[13:03] the door, you'll be cut off from the
[13:05] family, your friends, your health, your
[13:08] money, and you'll you'll live a a
[13:10] miserable life and say, "Why? What
[13:13] happened to those days?"
[13:16] &gt;&gt; When I walked in peace and I had a home
[13:18] and I had a family and I had a church
[13:20] and I had a five-fold ministry that
[13:22] loved me and cared about me. Yeah.
[13:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[13:29] &gt;&gt; A lot of times we can argue and it's not
[13:32] just teenagers,
[13:33] &gt;&gt; right?
[13:34] &gt;&gt; Sometimes that kind of thing happens in
[13:35] marriages. Sometimes that thing happens
[13:38] to dads or husbands or mothers or wives
[13:41] or both or all of them.
[13:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[13:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[13:44] &gt;&gt; And a lot of times they actually still
[13:46] live in their house. You might still
[13:48] live in your house. You might still come
[13:51] to church. and uh you know you you might
[13:54] even have some some some friends and
[13:57] some family that are gathered around you
[14:00] but you're not there really.
[14:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[14:03] &gt;&gt; Not really.
[14:06] Because it's true that even sometimes
[14:09] when you sit in church, you you you sit
[14:12] in church cuz maybe you like church.
[14:14] Maybe that's why you come. But but but
[14:17] you're not here. You're not really here
[14:19] when you're here.
[14:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[14:24] &gt;&gt; And you know, let me let me let me just
[14:27] try to smooth that over with a little
[14:30] bit of honey in the rock. Uh, you know,
[14:33] maybe that last part is not exactly true
[14:35] about you. Perhaps you you actually do
[14:38] come here to get cleaned up and get the
[14:40] washing of the water in the of the word
[14:42] because you like to feel clean
[14:44] spiritually. You like to feel good. You
[14:46] like to feel in contact with God because
[14:49] you know you need it and you want to
[14:50] feel clean.
[14:52] &gt;&gt; But you but you also know you also know
[14:56] and I hope you wouldn't try to deny it
[14:58] to the Holy Spirit. You also know that
[15:00] you're shortch changing God. Your
[15:03] friends and your family and they trust
[15:05] you and they love you and you're shortch
[15:07] changing all of them because of a of a
[15:10] lack of ferveny in your life. Amen.
[15:15] &gt;&gt; You know deep inside
[15:18] that a real ferveny is lacking. Not
[15:21] saying you're not a believer. Not saying
[15:22] you don't want to be at church. You do.
[15:24] You're here. Not trying to judge why
[15:26] you're here. I'm just wanting I just
[15:29] want you to be honest with yourself
[15:31] tonight. God put this burden on my heart
[15:34] and just trying to make the notes of it
[15:36] today. Could not stop weeping. And and I
[15:40] don't even have a particular case that
[15:42] I'm thinking of, but just the whole
[15:43] burden of this friends, God has called
[15:45] us to ferveny. He's called us to zeal.
[15:49] He's called us to care.
[15:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[15:53] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[15:55] &gt;&gt; I know. I know that as children of God,
[15:58] you would rather have that, wouldn't
[15:59] you?
[16:00] &gt;&gt; Wouldn't you rather have much more have
[16:02] a life where you know him and the power
[16:05] of his resurrection? Wouldn't you like
[16:07] to know him and all the wonderful
[16:09] freedoms that he offers you? And he
[16:11] offers you quite a bit.
[16:15] &gt;&gt; Where every morning
[16:18] I thought to myself,
[16:20] Lord, I want to wake up every morning
[16:23] in the fresh air of righteousness.
[16:27] &gt;&gt; I want to wake up every morning and feel
[16:29] the love of God sweeping down. And I
[16:32] want to lay my head on my pillow at
[16:34] night and say, "Lord, I love you." And
[16:36] he believes me and he knows it's true
[16:38] and I know it's true and wake up the
[16:40] next morning. Good morning, Lord. How
[16:41] can I serve you today, this beautiful
[16:44] day? Doesn't matter what's happening
[16:45] outside. I'm in a I'm living in a
[16:47] spiritual place
[16:52] &gt;&gt; where we breathe that fresh air
[16:56] &gt;&gt; of righteousness.
[17:02] The United States knows and the United
[17:04] States armed forces
[17:07] and I read an address to Congress. They
[17:09] have something called SEIR. I I guess
[17:12] I'm pronouncing it right. It's it's
[17:14] capital letters s e r e survival evasion
[17:17] resistance and escape.
[17:19] The United States equips its forces
[17:23] with a code of conduct and sear.
[17:27] And it's a training to prepare them in
[17:29] case they are captured by the enemy.
[17:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[17:32] &gt;&gt; To train them for possible isolation and
[17:35] captivity and to re be able to return
[17:38] with honor. And that that training,
[17:42] while necessary,
[17:44] has proven to fall woefully short
[17:47] against a rogue nation that
[17:50] systematically violates the laws of war.
[17:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[17:55] And I want to say to you tonight,
[17:57] friends,
[17:58] Satan is the head of a global rogue
[18:00] nation.
[18:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[18:03] &gt;&gt; And the spiritual warfare that he is
[18:05] waging against the planet Earth. And
[18:07] here we live, friends. and he hates the
[18:09] bride worst of all.
[18:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[18:13] You realize that the Bible teaches us
[18:16] that hell was created for the devil and
[18:20] his angels.
[18:22] &gt;&gt; But we also find out that a unique
[18:24] amazing thing happens near the end time,
[18:28] the early part of the 20th century under
[18:30] the fifth trumpet and its corresponding
[18:32] vial. We find that that that a that an
[18:36] angel falls from heaven and and and he
[18:39] has a key to the bottomless pit and
[18:40] brother Brandham ties him back to
[18:42] Isaiah's prophecy, how art thou fallen
[18:45] from heaven, oh Lucifer, son of the
[18:47] morning. And brother Brandham would say
[18:50] later in describing that event, he would
[18:53] say it like this, the lids torn from
[18:55] hell
[18:56] &gt;&gt; and demon powers are streaming into the
[18:58] earth. That's the day and hour that you
[19:00] and I live.
[19:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. The earth hadn't had that
[19:04] happening. Sure, Satan had a presence in
[19:07] the world, but it was not Satan's Eden.
[19:09] He couldn't even become Satan's Eden.
[19:11] First, he had to fall from heaven, be
[19:13] given a temporary authority to open the
[19:15] bottomless pit. That's a real thing.
[19:18] &gt;&gt; And the and those demons came up out of
[19:20] there. And brother Brandham said, "The
[19:21] lid is torn from hell. Demon powers are
[19:24] streaming through the earth." I'm here
[19:25] to tell you that the prison of hell and
[19:27] its chains of darkness have come to the
[19:30] surface. the world order from that
[19:32] moment.
[19:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[19:35] &gt;&gt; That time there in the very early part
[19:38] of the 20th century,
[19:40] the world began to devolve into a chaos
[19:43] that has only worsened until finally it
[19:47] has become what a prophet pulling no
[19:50] punches declared it to be
[19:54] Satan's Eden.
[19:55] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[19:58] to where pulling no punches.
[20:00] A prophet has made it clear that
[20:03] Lucifer, yes, that guy
[20:07] &gt;&gt; is the one and the same who was the
[20:10] enemy of God,
[20:11] &gt;&gt; who fell, who opened the pit, that same
[20:15] one who met Jesus in Gethsemane and
[20:17] tried to dissuade him from Calvary. That
[20:20] same one who offered him all the
[20:22] kingdoms of the earth and Jesus didn't
[20:23] argue that. Amen.
[20:25] &gt;&gt; That same one according to a prophet is
[20:28] now the god of this evil age.
[20:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[20:34] &gt;&gt; And he's made a god by popular demand
[20:37] because he had no authority to make
[20:39] himself a god. But he has ma become an
[20:42] object of worship. And the people now
[20:44] worshiping him make him the god the
[20:48] worshiped being of this age.
[20:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[20:54] An age Isaiah would describe as darkness
[20:56] covering the whole earth
[20:59] and gross darkness upon the minds of
[21:01] humanity worldwide
[21:05] with the former
[21:08] demon inmates
[21:10] now running the prison.
[21:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[21:12] &gt;&gt; Which has come to earth,
[21:15] the earth we call home.
[21:18] We're amazed,
[21:21] even astonished at times that the Lord
[21:23] has left us here this long.
[21:28] &gt;&gt; Come on, let's be honest.
[21:30] &gt;&gt; As I said to you Sunday, I I already
[21:33] expected to be several decades into the
[21:36] millennium by now.
[21:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. I growing up as a young man, I
[21:41] thought there I mean by now 2025 I
[21:44] expected us to be sitting around a rose
[21:46] garden in young bodies enjoying a
[21:49] millennial world and saying you remember
[21:51] that day back there. Oh, what a bunch of
[21:52] nonsense. We were so worried about it.
[21:55] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[21:56] &gt;&gt; Those things we chased after so hard
[22:02] &gt;&gt; that we're still here fighting this
[22:04] greatest battle. All I can say is that
[22:07] for sure you cannot lean to your own
[22:10] understanding.
[22:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[22:13] &gt;&gt; If you do, if you try to reason out your
[22:16] life, if you try to reason out your
[22:18] trials, if you try to reason with God,
[22:20] you remember some months ago we preached
[22:22] about Abraham and Abraham did that and
[22:25] God had made him a promise and God came
[22:27] back a second time and promised him.
[22:28] Then God come back a third time and even
[22:30] after three times, Abraham is now still
[22:33] looking at reasoning. But the I don't
[22:35] even have a son and this one board in my
[22:37] house is not my heir and looks like he's
[22:39] going to get everything. And I know what
[22:40] you promised me, but I just don't see
[22:43] any way when I'm looking at it from a
[22:45] reasonable standpoint. I don't see how
[22:48] it can be. I don't see how the promise
[22:51] can come to pass. Yes, I believe it, but
[22:53] my reasoning is battling my mind.
[22:55] Abraham opened up that conversation for
[22:58] a reason.
[22:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. He wasn't just passing the time
[23:02] making this wasn't chitchat.
[23:05] He wasn't just trying to have casual
[23:06] conversation. He's pouring out the
[23:08] burden of his heart. And the Lord after
[23:11] the third time was not going to come
[23:12] back around and say,"Abraham, I told you
[23:14] once. You know, parents say that if I've
[23:16] told you once, I've told you a thousand
[23:17] times." He loves He, you know, I'm not
[23:19] going to tell you a second time. I
[23:20] already told you second time. Now I'm
[23:22] telling you a third time. So now I got a
[23:24] challenge for you, Abraham. I need you
[23:25] to do something. And this is this is a
[23:27] command. I want you to walk outside,
[23:31] look up into the night sky, count the
[23:33] stars, and give me the number.
[23:37] &gt;&gt; And that was that was so unfair of God.
[23:42] It was so unreasonable because Abraham
[23:45] had no way to do that.
[23:47] &gt;&gt; Even science today with all of its
[23:50] instruments has no way to do that. So, I
[23:53] made the point to you that when you if
[23:55] you keep trying to reason God's
[23:57] promises, God will put you in an in in
[24:01] an unreasonable situation to get you to
[24:04] stop reasoning his word.
[24:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[24:12] &gt;&gt; Stop reasoning it, Abraham.
[24:13] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[24:16] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham has told us that God
[24:18] gave us 10 senses. You you have the five
[24:21] that are on your body. You have the five
[24:23] that are in your spirit.
[24:26] And and these 10 senses a prophet talks
[24:29] about were given to you to to contact
[24:33] the world you live in. Now this is your
[24:37] you know your touching, your tasting,
[24:39] your sight, your smell, your hearing.
[24:41] You've got memories, you've got reason,
[24:42] you've got affection, you've got
[24:43] imagination, you've got conscious. These
[24:46] are given to you so that you can contact
[24:48] the world you live in. But brother
[24:50] Brandham said, "But he did not give them
[24:52] to you to lead you."
[24:55] &gt;&gt; Right? Amen.
[24:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[24:57] &gt;&gt; Memory, conscience, reason, affection,
[25:00] imagination, what feels good, smells
[25:01] good, looks good here, sounds good,
[25:03] tastes good, that's not that's not what
[25:06] you're supposed to be following. He put
[25:08] a a part of himself down in your soul,
[25:10] and he comes to anoint that life, and
[25:12] that becomes the mind of Christ, and
[25:14] that's to lead you. And it doesn't
[25:16] matter how insensible, how unreasonable,
[25:19] or why we're still here in 2025. All I
[25:22] know is my redeemer liveth. And at the
[25:24] last day, I'll see him in the flesh, and
[25:26] I'll see him myself.
[25:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[25:32] &gt;&gt; Let me give you some prophetic intel on
[25:34] the leader of this rogue nation. You
[25:37] like that?
[25:38] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[25:40] I wanted to read it because brother
[25:43] Brandham here in the God of this evil
[25:44] age he says now think let that soak in
[25:47] and when you play this tape back on this
[25:49] point here stop for a while and think.
[25:53] So I did just that.
[25:58] He starts talking about Satan becoming
[26:00] the god of this evil age. It's the
[26:02] people that's done it.
[26:05] He says his works are exalted above
[26:09] God's word and manifested works. The
[26:13] wisdom of Satan
[26:16] which he gave to Eve at the beginning.
[26:19] Now listen, don't miss this.
[26:22] The wisdom of Satan
[26:24] is exalted to the throne of worship in
[26:27] man above the vindicated word of God for
[26:31] the hour. You don't even have to spend
[26:33] an hour on the streets to know that's
[26:35] true.
[26:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[26:37] &gt;&gt; Our churches prove that by their
[26:40] seminaries, schools of learning. Dr. So
[26:43] and so, teacher so and so, professor so
[26:46] and so has exalted their own knowledge
[26:49] socalled from Satan.
[26:52] Their their knowledge so-called truth
[26:54] above the vindicated promise of God made
[26:57] clear right before them. and man fall
[27:00] for it.
[27:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[27:03] &gt;&gt; So it's a ruse. He got tricked. He got
[27:06] duped. He's fell for something.
[27:11] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says, "And a man will
[27:13] fall for it." See,
[27:16] and a lot of times, you know, Brother
[27:18] Brandham would just say that and I say
[27:19] that I sometimes I'll catch myself
[27:21] saying I'll go I'll make a point. I go,
[27:23] see, and it's just something we say. And
[27:26] preachers say that. And brother Brandman
[27:28] when he when I read that sea and there's
[27:29] a question mark there and I thought yeah
[27:32] I do I do see that
[27:36] I do I thought about a conversation
[27:41] that I had with a very fine man and I
[27:43] mean that very sincerely very fine man
[27:46] you know not a not a believer of the
[27:48] message a nominal Christian but a very
[27:50] fine fellow honest I've never found him
[27:53] to be dishonest at all he seems to be
[27:55] very noble very sincere here leads Bible
[27:57] studies. I've set in on his Bible
[27:59] studies that he leads there in his home.
[28:01] He doesn't have to do that. He's a very
[28:02] wealthy man. He takes his time to help
[28:05] people. He's he's been a great friend to
[28:07] to members of my family. And you know, I
[28:12] had a a really nice conversation with
[28:14] him the other day, and I say it was a
[28:15] very nice conversation, but it left me a
[28:17] little sad after it was over. um you
[28:20] know because he he he had a really very
[28:23] sincere question that you know he was
[28:26] going on a or had been on a podcast and
[28:28] they wanted him to come back and be be a
[28:30] guest speaker again and they were trying
[28:32] to settle the question what is the
[28:34] gospel very good question that's an
[28:35] excellent question
[28:37] and you know he he had a very good he
[28:40] had a very good answer already prepared
[28:42] he's an intelligent man a Bible student
[28:45] and you know but but but his answer is
[28:48] the little twominute pre packaged almost
[28:54] read from a script explaining if you've
[28:56] only got two minutes with somebody can
[28:58] you tell them what the gospel is quickly
[29:02] &gt;&gt; and he he wanted my take what what would
[29:04] you say I don't know why he was asking
[29:06] me I don't know if he thought I'd
[29:07] memorize some kind of a you know I had
[29:09] that happen to me one time I'm talking
[29:11] to a man and next thing I know he's
[29:13] sitting beside me reading me the
[29:14] sinner's prayer
[29:16] &gt;&gt; and I I know what you you understand I'm
[29:20] What are you doing?
[29:23] You know, I'm in here trying to be a
[29:24] light to you and you're okay, never
[29:26] mind. Whatever.
[29:30] It it it it shocked me. But I
[29:33] appreciated his zeal. He was also a very
[29:35] fine man. Jerry Stokes, who it was, a
[29:37] lot of people know Jerry and uh very
[29:40] very very fine man. And I've done plenty
[29:44] of business at his dealerships. I like
[29:45] the I like Stokes Honda, Stokes Toyota.
[29:47] very fine people we have in this
[29:49] community.
[29:51] And you know when I when I began to to
[29:55] give my my answer I said well you know I
[29:59] said if somebody if you just want my
[30:01] quick short take on what is the gospel?
[30:04] I said to me the gospel is the answer to
[30:07] Job's question.
[30:09] &gt;&gt; Yeah. It's the answer. It's the question
[30:11] that plagued mankind for millennia that
[30:13] brother Brandham took up when he and
[30:16] brother Brandham is beginning to preach
[30:17] and takes the first 45 minutes. Oh my
[30:20] goodness. And and and he and he and he
[30:22] and he's talking about how that that you
[30:25] know man had suffered. And it Job said
[30:28] if a if the flowers die, they come back.
[30:30] If the tree dies, if the grass withers,
[30:32] it comes back. But if a man die, can he
[30:35] live again? Is this it? Is there another
[30:37] life? What's what's happening? What's
[30:39] hap? Why am I here? What's life all
[30:41] about? And brother Brandham said that
[30:43] day when Christ rose, he answered the
[30:45] question. And he set mankind free. No,
[30:48] you don't need to fear anymore. The sun
[30:51] has risen.
[30:53] &gt;&gt; It is the rising of the sun. And he
[30:55] said, when that sun went up into the
[30:56] heavens that day, it was the greatest
[30:58] declaration the world had ever had. Yes,
[31:01] there's another life. Yes, you can be
[31:03] forgiven. No, you don't have to die. You
[31:06] don't ever have to die. Amen.
[31:11] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[31:12] &gt;&gt; And I I just I I went into a 30 60 90
[31:16] second
[31:18] montage of that I suppose you'd call it.
[31:20] And and he just said, "Well, yeah,
[31:23] that's I've never thought about that."
[31:26] Um, you know, taking it from the angle
[31:27] of Job and that didn't surprise me.
[31:30] We're constantly you say sometimes the
[31:32] most rudimentary elementary things and
[31:34] and you can tell people have never
[31:36] they've never known the Bible could be
[31:37] used like that. I'm here to tell you
[31:40] William Brham taught things out of this
[31:42] Bible that you're guaranteed not to hear
[31:43] in the average Sunday morning pullpit.
[31:46] &gt;&gt; And I don't love it because it's more
[31:48] knowledge or more theology. I love it
[31:50] because it lives.
[31:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Yeah.
[31:54] &gt;&gt; And I and I and and it's and it's
[31:56] provable not only in chapter and verse,
[31:58] but it's provable in the life that it
[32:00] brings.
[32:02] &gt;&gt; So, you know, and he he said, "Well, you
[32:05] know, I that's great." And it was kind
[32:07] of like, you know, that's really good,
[32:09] but what I was after was, you know, if
[32:11] I've only I I can't preach a sermon to
[32:13] somebody. I said, "Well, I didn't preach
[32:15] you a sermon. I just gave you a little
[32:17] short." He said, "Well, I guess what I'm
[32:18] looking for is just a little, you know,"
[32:20] he just wanted X's and O's. ABCD.1 point
[32:23] 2.3
[32:25] and I I so cuz I really like him a lot
[32:29] and I was trying in my roundabout way to
[32:32] say yeah but what good is that?
[32:37] &gt;&gt; Yeah,
[32:37] &gt;&gt; if if all you give them is the is the
[32:39] X's and O's, the devil knows all of
[32:41] that. All you've done is give them
[32:44] mechanics of it, but you can't really
[32:46] explain anything about the dynamic power
[32:48] of the life that comes in you when you
[32:50] believe it. And I said, I'm not I I
[32:53] said, that's that's great if you're
[32:55] trying to give them information. I'm all
[32:57] for that.
[32:58] &gt;&gt; Put it on a track. Put it on the card.
[33:00] Hand it to somebody. I'm not opposed to
[33:02] that. Brother Brandham talks about that
[33:04] car salesman who just found a little
[33:06] track and it led him to eternal life.
[33:08] Where will you spend eternity? And
[33:09] that's all it took. And it put him put
[33:11] him to thinking. Then the Lord started
[33:12] talking to him. So I'm not against that
[33:15] at all. I'm for that. I But but but I
[33:17] but I found it. I found that that that
[33:21] entry point without what really follows
[33:23] the real thing that can really bring
[33:26] somebody to life that can really show
[33:28] them that he's not just some man-made
[33:30] system. He's a living being.
[33:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:34] &gt;&gt; So when brother Brandham is saying, "See
[33:36] man fall for it." I do you see? I said
[33:38] yes. I said to myself, "I do. I see it.
[33:41] I see it and it's heartbreaking when you
[33:43] see it so clearly but you realize that
[33:46] they don't see it or maybe they refused
[33:49] to take it in deeply into their heart
[33:51] and that see he he started speeding up
[33:53] and sounded a little nervous like he was
[33:55] just trying not to have this
[33:56] conversation and I was all too happy to
[33:58] back out cuz it was you know I was
[34:00] starting to feel discombobulated myself.
[34:02] I wanted to go on to greater things. He
[34:04] didn't seem open to that at all. And I
[34:06] wanted to end the call very good and we
[34:08] did and we're great friends and I wish
[34:10] him all the best and I'd help him again
[34:12] at any time. He he talked to me about
[34:15] maybe going on a podcast with him. I'd
[34:17] be happy to do I'd probably recommend JD
[34:18] do it, but I'd be happy to do it. So,
[34:22] you know, we sometimes when you when you
[34:26] have something
[34:28] that you know would help someone.
[34:31] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[34:33] and you you you have such strong
[34:36] affection for them. Perhaps maybe
[34:38] there's someone special in your life and
[34:41] they don't really see what you see, but
[34:44] you want them to see it so desperately
[34:46] bad. And I and sometimes, you know, can
[34:51] I just say this without flipping the
[34:54] script and making you tighten up on me?
[34:57] You know, sometimes God's very
[35:00] well-intentioned
[35:01] family members,
[35:03] &gt;&gt; yeah,
[35:04] &gt;&gt; get caught on that slippery slope. They
[35:06] have so much affection for this person,
[35:07] and they want them to see it so bad, and
[35:09] the person doesn't hasn't don't see it,
[35:13] don't want to see it, don't really want
[35:14] to talk about it, but they they get
[35:17] tricked into their mind if I just start
[35:19] to compromise and let down my own bars
[35:21] and I can stay close and kind of hang
[35:23] out with them. And all that happens to
[35:25] you down the road, that person is no
[35:27] more converted than ever. And now you're
[35:28] half
[35:28] &gt;&gt; backslid.
[35:31] &gt;&gt; See,
[35:33] &gt;&gt; I can tell you something, friends. Jesus
[35:35] never did that.
[35:38] &gt;&gt; Say, I love sinners. Nobody loves
[35:40] sinners more than Jesus.
[35:42] &gt;&gt; But he never did that. Did he Did he eat
[35:45] with sinners? He did eat with sinners.
[35:47] But when he went into the house of Simon
[35:50] to that great feast, he demonstrated
[35:52] that he never compromised the gospel
[35:55] because they left him over in a corner
[35:57] unwashed, uncked, uncared for, and all
[36:00] alone and and pushed him aside. I'm here
[36:03] to tell you something. There was nothing
[36:05] about him that was accommodating to the
[36:07] sinner.
[36:08] &gt;&gt; He loved them, but he stood clearly on
[36:11] the word of God. And that's what I want
[36:13] to stand. I'm happy to help anybody I
[36:15] can and project the love of God. And I
[36:18] and I know it takes the Holy Spirit. And
[36:19] I know there's going to be foolish
[36:21] virgin and the heathen. And I know not
[36:23] everybody in heaven is going to be a
[36:24] message believer, but excuse me, I am a
[36:27] message believer.
[36:28] &gt;&gt; And excuse me, I have received the whole
[36:30] word. And excuse me, but I want everyone
[36:33] to see it.
[36:39] &gt;&gt; They didn't care about him.
[36:42] They left him in a corner unwashed
[36:45] and unloved. Very much unloved.
[36:50] But there was a broken woman.
[36:55] &gt;&gt; A life
[36:56] so broken.
[36:59] Brother Brandham says she was
[37:01] embarrassed
[37:03] for him to know where she got the money
[37:06] to buy the ointment.
[37:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:09] And the Bible says she stood behind him
[37:12] weeping. And there he was, Jesus. And
[37:15] brother Brandon, Jesus with dirty feet.
[37:18] &gt;&gt; And it broke the prophet's heart to
[37:20] think. He kept saying, "My Lord." Just
[37:22] to think of it. My lord, sitting there,
[37:24] the king of heaven and earth and the
[37:26] prince of peace and the mighty God and
[37:28] the everlasting father, the one who
[37:30] loved everybody and was giving his life
[37:32] for the sinner. And God was going to
[37:34] trade the innocent for the guilty. And
[37:37] there he sits, unwashed, unloved,
[37:40] uncetpt for, unconcerned. But here was
[37:42] one broken woman that loved him. And I
[37:46] thought to myself, you know, she she
[37:49] brother Brandham said, she went in
[37:50] there. She knew he'll know. He'll know
[37:52] where I got this money. She tells the
[37:54] man, "Here's my money. I want the best
[37:57] you've got. I He'll know where it come
[37:58] from, but I don't care. I got to do
[38:00] something for him." I'm here to tell
[38:02] you, she didn't have anything else she
[38:04] could offer him in life but the results
[38:06] of all of her sin. But she brought that
[38:09] to Jesus.
[38:10] &gt;&gt; She didn't have any she didn't have any
[38:13] water to wash his feet, but she had a
[38:15] river of tears that had been building up
[38:18] her whole life.
[38:21] &gt;&gt; Oh my. And she began to weep and she
[38:23] began to anoint his feet with the
[38:25] ointment. She began to cry. She began to
[38:28] dry his feet with her tears. Oh my. She
[38:31] she here here here is a woman with a
[38:33] lifetime of regrets.
[38:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:37] &gt;&gt; And it's all pouring out at the feet of
[38:39] the master. I sometimes I get so wrapped
[38:43] up in brother Brandham and he goes there
[38:45] and he says, "Oh wondering star,
[38:49] oh wondering star, sons of God,
[38:52] daughters of God, hurling through the
[38:56] blackness of sin in this life and away
[38:59] from God. Don't you know you came from
[39:01] God? You're part of his creative word.
[39:04] And he says, "Oh, wondering stars, wind
[39:07] your way back home. Come back to the
[39:09] Lord. I thought about I thought about oh
[39:11] sad sinner. I thought about all sad
[39:14] prisoner of war." And maybe you've been
[39:17] a believer and and you love God and you
[39:20] really do and he really knows it and you
[39:22] actually have faith and you've been born
[39:24] again, but you've you've allowed the
[39:26] carnal edges of this world to draw you
[39:29] away. And sometimes you've become a
[39:31] prisoner of war. We might have some here
[39:33] tonight. I want to tell you something
[39:34] that the same God who created heaven and
[39:36] earth can open those prison doors like
[39:39] he did for Peter, like he did for Paul
[39:41] and Silas. He can drop those chains off
[39:43] of you. Come home, prisoner of war.
[39:46] Walk out of that prison. Walk out of
[39:48] those chains that were those were meant
[39:50] for the devil and his angels, not God's
[39:53] family.
[39:56] &gt;&gt; They weren't meant for you.
[40:00] &gt;&gt; Bring a repentant heart to Jesus.
[40:04] &gt;&gt; I'm here to tell you something, friends.
[40:06] We're going to we're I'm out of time and
[40:08] we're going to take up some prayer
[40:10] requests. I want you to know something
[40:12] tonight that you have the beautiful
[40:15] ability to take those chains, whatever
[40:19] they have been that have held you back
[40:22] from zeal and real ferveny before the
[40:26] Lord. and you've allowed the this dark
[40:30] evil day with darkness covering the
[40:32] world and men's minds covered in
[40:34] darkness and and all it's all global and
[40:37] Satan's Eden and sometimes yeah we're
[40:40] coming to church and we love how it
[40:42] cleans us. we we love. But you know
[40:44] something, it it it it it I I I just
[40:47] heard brother Josh Bennett talk about
[40:49] this how that how that you know it it
[40:51] comes back to a a personal choice that
[40:54] you've got to make and that God, you
[40:56] know, when when God comes to raise
[40:59] Lazarus from the grave, Jesus could have
[41:03] moved the stone with the word, but he
[41:06] wouldn't move the stone cuz he didn't
[41:07] put it there. And he tells the people
[41:10] who put it there, move it. I'm here to
[41:13] do the work. I'm here to do the miracle.
[41:14] I'm here to fulfill the vision. But I
[41:16] need you to do the work. Oh, wandering
[41:19] star. Oh, prisoner of war, drop those
[41:22] chains. God, why don't you stand up on
[41:24] your feet with me tonight and say, "I'm
[41:26] raising my hands in freedom and I'm
[41:29] dropping chains and I'm walking out of
[41:31] prison doors. Hallelujah. I want to be
[41:34] completely free. Amen.
[41:37] &gt;&gt; I want to have access to all that God
[41:40] has given me.
[41:43] &gt;&gt; Come. Yes. Musicians, please.
[41:48] &gt;&gt; We're going to take up requests tonight.
[41:50] I have a few. You know, I can say to you
[41:52] tonight, I can say, "Bring chains that
[41:56] walk away from those chains that have
[41:57] held back your ferveny.
[42:00] Bring it to the master." You got a chain
[42:02] on your life. You feel like you're a
[42:03] prisoner of war. some some kind of
[42:05] thing, some lifestyle.
[42:08] Remember I said at the beginning, we're
[42:10] talking about transgressions.
[42:12] Sinful lifestyles
[42:15] lead to sins.
[42:18] Failing lifestyles lead to failure.
[42:21] Transgressive lifestyles lead to more
[42:24] transgressions. James made that very
[42:26] clear to us. Oh, I'm here to tell you
[42:29] something, friends. Whether your need
[42:31] tonight is is spiritual, emotional,
[42:36] maybe you've got physical uh problem and
[42:39] the devil has battled you. I'll invite
[42:41] you to come tonight and bring that
[42:42] sickness to the king. Bring those chains
[42:44] to the king. Bring that prison to the
[42:46] king. It doesn't matter. He's here to
[42:48] set you at liberty.
[42:50] &gt;&gt; Oh, I'm here to tell you something,
[42:52] friends. Satan has maybe battled you for
[42:55] a sickness for a long time. Well, you
[42:57] know something? If anything at all, you
[42:59] have proven this that you're still a
[43:01] believer and he has failed. And I would
[43:04] invite you tonight to bring that
[43:05] sickness to the king and let let's do
[43:08] away with this devil tormenting you like
[43:10] that.
[43:11] &gt;&gt; How many are on board with that tonight?
[43:14] &gt;&gt; Oh, gather around. We got to go here.
[43:16] It's already uh 25 till. Come on and
[43:19] gather around the front with me.
[43:21] [Music]
[43:23] &gt;&gt; It doesn't matter what the need might
[43:25] be.
[43:27] Amen.
[43:29] &gt;&gt; God is well able, more than able.
[43:32] He is uh Hey De,
[43:35] he is able more than able to accomplish
[43:38] what concerns me today. You know that

[44:26] to do much more than I could ever dream.
[44:32] He
[44:34] is able,
[44:36] more
[44:38] than able
[44:42] to make me what he wants me to be. Sing
[44:47] it again.
[44:49] He is able. Let's raise our hands.
[44:53] &gt;&gt; More than able.
[44:56] Yes, Lord to accomplish what concerns
[45:02] me.

[45:45] Yes, he is.
[45:46] [Music]
[45:52] Sister Melissa writes, "Please pray for
[45:54] my daughter Nicole.
[45:56] She's under a heavy load at this time.
[45:58] Not only does she work full-time as a
[46:00] pharmacy tech, the store she works for
[46:01] is currently without a manager, she's
[46:04] had to pick up all the manager
[46:06] responsibilities along with her own."
[46:10] Her
[46:12] fiance's dad has been diagnosed with
[46:14] cancer and now lives with her. She is
[46:17] his caretaker after working 12-hour
[46:19] shifts. My goodness. With 2-hour
[46:22] roundtrip commute, she's on her way to
[46:26] take him to the ER due to a complication
[46:28] from his diagnosis. She's asking prayer
[46:31] for him and I'm asking prayer for her.
[46:35] She carries this burden without
[46:37] complaint, but I know she is exhausted.
[46:39] It doesn't surprise me Coley would carry
[46:41] that without complaint. That's the kind
[46:43] of girl she's always been. How many will
[46:45] I pray for Nicole tonight? We've loved
[46:48] her a long time. Knew her since she was
[46:50] just a little girl. Sister Deborah Lowry
[46:53] needs prayer tonight for pain in her
[46:54] back and her leg.
[46:57] Brother Caleb Campbell has a prayer
[46:58] request. I have a lady that I work with
[47:01] by name of Sher Hinnan that has been
[47:04] diagnosed with liver cancer. Apparently,
[47:06] chemo doesn't work for this type of
[47:08] cancer. So the next step was to do an
[47:11] imunotherapy,
[47:13] but that was also unsuccessful.
[47:16] They now want to try a drug that is
[47:17] supposed to block blood flow to the
[47:19] cancer cells. Apparently, it wouldn't
[47:21] kill the cancer, but it would help it
[47:23] stop growing.
[47:25] She is undergoing a lot of tests this
[47:28] week to see if that drug is something
[47:31] her body can even handle. I've had her
[47:34] heavy on my heart for the last two
[47:36] weeks. And I told her yesterday that I
[47:38] was going to ask our church to pray for
[47:39] her. I told her we're a bibleelving
[47:42] church who has seen miracles take place
[47:43] even in cancer cases. And that we will
[47:47] be believing
[47:49] uh we will be believing for a complete
[47:52] healing.
[47:53] Amen.
[47:55] [Music]
[47:56] I don't seem to have any other prayer
[47:59] requests. Hopefully you've got them all
[48:02] into me by now.
[48:07] He is able. He is able. Let's sing it.
[48:10] Oh, he is aable.
[48:13] More
[48:15] than able
[48:19] to accomplish what concerns
[48:23] me today.
[48:26] He
[48:27] is aable,
[48:30] more
[48:31] than able
[48:34] to handle to handle anything that comes
[48:39] my way.
[48:42] Oh, he is able,
[48:46] more than able.
[48:49] Think about what you're singing to to do
[48:52] much more than I could ever dream.
[48:57] [Music]
[48:58] He is able,
[49:02] more than able
[49:07] to make me what he wants me to be.
[49:13] Take the hand or join with someone
[49:16] standing near you. Let's go to the Lord
[49:18] in prayer.
[49:22] Master, we are before you tonight.
[49:26] We want to thank you, Lord, for your
[49:28] word, for your presence, for your
[49:30] anointing, for helping me to unbburden
[49:33] my heart, Lord,
[49:35] with all that time would allow. And
[49:39] perhaps I'll have another time with more
[49:41] to say, but I feel satisfied in my heart
[49:44] tonight that the word went forth, Lord.
[49:47] And on a Wednesday night, it it found
[49:50] like an arrow of deliverance, Lord. It
[49:52] may even be across the internet, someone
[49:55] listening, it may be someone here
[49:57] tonight that days from now, that arrow
[50:00] of deliverance, Lord, will strike their
[50:02] heart.
[50:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:03] &gt;&gt; And it'll be a freedom.
[50:05] I pray, Lamb of God, that your children
[50:08] near and far realize that they don't
[50:11] have to live as prisoners of war. They
[50:14] don't have to be prisoners to this rogue
[50:16] nation, this rogue leader. They serve
[50:19] the great King of heaven, Lord. And you
[50:22] open prison doors. You you you you break
[50:24] chains and feathers off of people's
[50:26] lives. You forgive sin to the uttermost.
[50:31] You turn to that woman, Lord, weeping.
[50:34] You said to Simon, "I say unto you, her
[50:37] sins, which are many." Oh, he knew of
[50:40] her sins. She wasn't wrong, thinking
[50:44] that he'll know where I got this money.
[50:47] He'll know how I earned it, but I can't
[50:49] help it. I've got to give him Lord, you
[50:51] wanted her to come with that level of
[50:54] honesty.
[50:56] I pray that each and every person will
[50:58] meet you at that same level. If they do,
[51:01] then you have to treat them the way you
[51:03] treated her. And you have to say your
[51:05] sins, child, your transgressions, your
[51:08] carnality, your your your your lack of
[51:11] zeal, your lack of fervent ferveny,
[51:13] which is big, which is huge. Your sins
[51:15] and transgressions are many, but they're
[51:17] all forgiven.
[51:19] &gt;&gt; And I'm ready to restore you. Walk
[51:21] closer to me, child. That's all you have
[51:24] to do. Walk away from the world, the God
[51:27] of this evil age.
[51:29] He loves hanging around your family,
[51:31] Lord. But the the family of God must be
[51:34] the ones to walk away from him cuz he's
[51:37] certainly not going to walk away. He's
[51:39] not going anywhere anytime soon, Lord.
[51:42] But Father, we have an ability to stay
[51:45] clear of him, to take things out of our
[51:47] lives and and our and our homes and our
[51:51] occupations, our relationships, to
[51:53] remove anything that's causing a lack of
[51:55] ferveny toward you and your word. We
[51:59] want to breathe the fresh air of
[52:01] cleanness. We want to breathe in that
[52:04] that deep air of righteousness, that
[52:07] clean feeling of knowing that God is
[52:09] pleased with your life.
[52:11] knowing that he's a word and whisper of
[52:14] away and you can say father and he'll
[52:16] say here am I my son
[52:18] &gt;&gt; hallelujah
[52:20] oh grant it Lord break every chain break
[52:23] every open every prison door break every
[52:26] sickness and disease upon your people
[52:28] meet the need Lord that sister Melissa
[52:30] turns in for Nicole right now Nicole
[52:32] with her own request for this other
[52:34] person and a mother now for her daughter
[52:37] we're joining with our sister Lord to
[52:39] believe for the for what might look
[52:41] impossible, but with God all things are
[52:44] possible. And the Bible says, "Nothing
[52:47] shall be thought impossible with God."
[52:51] The more impossible it is, the better
[52:53] you like it, the greater glory you get
[52:55] out of it.
[52:57] Lord, I pray for Sister Deborah and this
[53:00] pain in her leg and her back and she's
[53:02] did all she can do and let the doctors
[53:04] do what they can do. Father, we're
[53:06] asking for your special touch upon her
[53:08] tonight, this very night, Lord.
[53:11] I pray for this poor woman under the
[53:14] affliction of a cancer demon. Lord, we
[53:17] have another woman, my wife and I met.
[53:19] She's under a under a death sentence
[53:21] from a demon of cancer. We condemn the
[53:23] work of cancer in both of these ladies.
[53:26] We lift prayers. We pray against you,
[53:28] Satan. We pray against you in the name
[53:31] of Jesus Christ. Lord God, may you come
[53:34] with healing in your wings, with mercy.
[53:36] Oh God, your throne is established in
[53:39] mercy. May it be so, Lord God. May it
[53:42] let the light of God's mercy reach.
[53:46] Lord, I pray that you give us courage to
[53:48] face the dark world to face this time
[53:52] where darkness is short to shore and
[53:56] gross darkness in the minds of humanity
[53:58] the world over.
[54:00] the whole the whole all the all the
[54:04] former inmates of hell. Hell created for
[54:07] the devil and his angels now loosed upon
[54:10] the earth. And the inmates are running
[54:11] the whole country, running the whole
[54:13] nation, running the whole world, a whole
[54:16] order of called Satan's Eden, a cosmos,
[54:19] an order that is someday soon going to
[54:21] pass away and give way to a new order.
[54:24] We look forward to that day, Lord. We
[54:26] look forward with great eagerness. We're
[54:29] not in no ways tired, Lord. We're ready
[54:31] to continue fighting. We're ready to
[54:32] keep pressing the battle, Lord God. I
[54:35] pray you'll help us
[54:37] [Music]
[54:39] one for all and all for one together.
[54:42] We commit these things into your hands
[54:44] tonight. I think we've said plenty,
[54:47] Lord. Now, let the Holy Spirit have his
[54:50] way in Jesus' name. One more time. He is
[54:54] aable
[54:56] more
[54:58] than a
[55:00] oh yes to accomplish what concerns
[55:06] me today.
[55:10] He is aable,
[55:13] &gt;&gt; more than able
[55:16] [Music]
[55:18] to handle anything that comes my way.
[55:26] Oh, he is aable
[55:29] more.
[55:30] Hallelujah.
[55:32] more
[55:37] than I
[55:38] &gt;&gt; could ever dream.
[55:41] He
[55:43] is able
[55:46] more than able
[55:50] to make me to make me what he wants me
[55:55] to be. One more time. to make me. Oh, to
[55:59] make me what he wants me to be. One more
[56:04] time. One more time. Oh, to make me what

[56:28] Okay. Make Give it Brad behind you.
[56:30] Yeah. Yeah. Amen.
[56:36] All right, buddy. Uh, just like to give
[56:38] a quick testimony for my wife. We, uh,
[56:40] had a couple years ago, she developed a
[56:42] nodule on her thyroid. So, it's kind of
[56:44] swollen on one side. We had it biopsied
[56:46] and it was clear. And so, we were
[56:48] grateful for that. Um, and then over the
[56:51] last few years, it's grown. So it got a
[56:53] little bigger, a little more noticeable,
[56:55] really bugged her. So we found a thyroid
[56:57] specialist, went to them and had tests
[56:59] done, biopsy, came back yesterday,
[57:01] totally benign, no problem, and a
[57:03] treatment to to shrink it and get it
[57:05] going. So we just want to thank God for
[57:07] that.
[57:08] [Applause]
[57:15] &gt;&gt; All right. So, I was playing football um
[57:18] a couple days ago and I fell and twisted
[57:21] my ankle. At first, it didn't hurt that
[57:24] badly, but um after I had just like
[57:28] after a little while at home, it started
[57:31] actually getting painful. And by that um
[57:35] and by I think Thursday or Friday night,
[57:38] I could barely even walk on it.
[57:42] Um yeah, I'm pretty sure that was
[57:44] Thursday. So Friday I had just been I
[57:47] couldn't go to school so I had to stay
[57:49] at home and um I I had just been trying
[57:55] my dad has like had put like ice packs
[57:58] on it and everything to try and um heal
[58:01] it. And um so on Saturday my birthday
[58:06] party was then and I woke up and I was
[58:10] able to walk on the ankle and my ankle
[58:12] did not hurt at all.
[58:16] [Applause]
[58:17] [Music]
[58:18] [Applause]
[58:20] Nice birthday present.
[58:23] &gt;&gt; Anybody else before we go?
[58:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord.
[58:28] &gt;&gt; All right, go ahead.
[58:31] &gt;&gt; I just wanted to say how much tonight's
[58:33] sermon meant to me.
[58:35] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[58:35] &gt;&gt; I've been studying, as I've been sharing
[58:38] with Caleb, uh 2 Kings 18, 19, and 20.
[58:41] And I so appreciated King Hezekiah
[58:45] standing up against the Syrian army. And
[58:50] um you really made it come to life
[58:53] &gt;&gt; tonight with the unprepared and
[58:56] prepared, but he there's no way in the
[58:59] natural without God going and slaying
[59:03] all of the Assyrians that night. In one
[59:05] night, he slayed them all.
[59:07] &gt;&gt; Yeah. And uh I can't imagine the
[59:09] reasoning that he must have gone
[59:11] through. Boy, if I don't do something,
[59:13] then there we're all going to die and
[59:15] just the thoughts that he must have went
[59:17] through and the troubles and um anyway,
[59:20] tonight's sermon meant a great deal to
[59:21] me. Praise the Lord.
[59:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.

[1:00:32] through me.
[1:00:34] Oh,
[1:00:38] through me
[1:00:45] [Music]
[1:00:49] through me.
[1:00:51] Holy
[1:00:53] Spirit
[1:00:56] flow through me.
[1:00:58] [Music]
[1:01:02] Flow through me.
[1:01:05] [Music]
[1:01:16] As I lift my hands to worship.
[1:01:26] [Music]
[1:01:51] Get my mind closed.
[1:01:56] [Music]
