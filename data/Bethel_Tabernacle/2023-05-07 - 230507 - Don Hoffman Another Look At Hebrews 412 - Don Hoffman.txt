[Music] man I love that song speaks deeply to my heart do you know what they just sang brother Bradham says is the man [Music] in the message adoption brother Brown talks at the man that God has to test and he said you know what I did because he puts him under the tutor of the Holy Spirit he says what'd you do to him he says well I threw him down I stomped on him I made him sick put him in the hospital I turned his family against him turned his church against him oh what was his response that was his response we have no place to go there's no place we want to go there's no place except in our Lord Jesus Christ let's pray oh Heavenly Father hear everything to us [Music] not just a part of our Lives you are our lives this world could be totally stripped away from us and [Music] that's okay because we know you'll take our hand and lead us through guide us home to you father thank you take your place Lord take your place in each one of us permanently but even now this morning so you can do what you want to do in US say what you want to say and just ask Lord you'll be glorified we ask in Jesus name foreign [Music] like to just greet you all from the land of ten thousand lakes up north and uh when you're just around the family of God you feel at home you know that doesn't make any difference where you're at but uh around those who have been given prior that precious faith and revelation of Jesus Christ in this day I'd like to say first of all those of you who Miss Sunday school really miss something the Lord's blessed Jason with an incredible Teaching Ministry and uh we're all blessed by it thank you all of you who live here that for welcoming Amy and Jay down here it means a lot to Mary and I and so thankful For Your Love acceptance of them also I just want to say I'm sorry I missed brother Jason and his family truly respect him and his ministry and I want you to know if I say anything here that is contrary to what is taught or spoken of here just that's crazy hold on just disregard me but stick with your pastor Okay so this morning want to get into the scriptures and I've got a lot of quotes here and I base in most of my thought this morning on a message in 1965 and and north and not and it's one of those things I think it's because of where we're living in time right now that you can pick up these messages that oh I know all about that and a while back the Lord spoke to my heart and says pick this up and read it I said I know all about this and no no said not it's all about the denominations they don't know that they're blind miserable and naked and I don't need to read it read it and and I picked it up and I just started crying Lord I never saw this before and it became a whole new message and there's so many of them because of where we are now and because of what we're facing now you watch when the spirit gets into this word each one will become a new book and I've been preaching for a while on the message um it is the rising of the Sun and I finally told the people back home so that that's not just a message it's a message full of messages and I'm approaching each one of them right now because each message preached is just loaded and full of messages that will speak to you right now right where you're at right with what we're facing right at this time I'm brother Ken's sister Anita good to see you guys further down some of you have I've met and I'd like to meet you all but I some of you have never met so God bless you all okay we're gonna take another look this morning at a scripture which is Hebrews 4 12 and I know we all know that and brother branham's most common reference to that is indiscernment lines right so uh in there there's so much more for us even today with what the spirit of the Lord is doing and what he did in the prophet and what he's doing in us today and I guess that's another thing starting out is taking all of the things that the prophet taught and saying Amen to all of them because he says if you have the Holy Ghost you say Amen to every word of God right well he says well we'll get into that how's that okay so since we're taking a look at Hebrews 12 let's start with Romans chapter 12. okay there it is now this is the whis translation if you ever heard there's a man by the name of Kenneth weast and you use them don't you quite a bit he's and just gifted and if you look at Romans 12 with the KJV why don't you go in your cell phones or your Bibles there and it says I beseech you therefore Brethren by the mercies of God now that beseech in the Greek or when you hear that word beseech that's carries a very strong emotional tie to it in other words there's something in the heart of Paul when he was speaking this saying I'm desperate uh for you to receive what I'm saying now it's just not oh here's a nice thought and take it or leave it no that's not it I'm begging you okay this is something I believe the spirit needs you so that's what he's saying I beseech you therefore brother and by the mercies of God did you present your body as a Living Sacrifice holy acceptable unto God which is your reasonable service and be not conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind and now watch what he says here it's amazing that you might prove okay the proof is in the puddin isn't it yeah okay so there's something by doing what he tells us to do that's going to bring something out of my life that proves God is in his word working with me okay that you may prove what is the good and acceptable and perfect will of God now the good old weast translation I therefore beg of you brethren please brother through the instrumentality and aforementioned mercies of God that once by a once for all presentation of your bodies at the disposal of God a sacrifice a living one a Holy One well pleasing your rational sacred service now listen to this this is where I was wondering when he said this how could you come up with this with these but actually if you go back and study some of those Greek words and I'm not a scholar so I'm not but I like to read he's it's an incredible how he brings us out and this is a very accurate in in the Greek that he's translating okay and he says stop assuming an outward expression that does not come from within you don't you love that that's not the real you right that's not the true you why are you acting this way it's like a parent watching over his kid isn't it what happened that way and God has to say that to us in sort of those tones sometimes okay that doesn't represent Who You Are right okay so that's a correction we all take from him okay stop assuming an outward expression that does not come from within you and is not representative of what you are in your inner being how rich is that yeah that's not the real you but it's patterned after this age oh teenagers wake up okay who's the real you and I think that is the age that is critical right who's the real you because you have a Warfare going on inside of you something inside deep inside of you as Jason we got these two Natures fighting within us you know and you know what God's trying to help you and he will identify the true you and when he you hear from your heavenly Father Who I Really Am it's going to help you win a lot more battles and that's what we need in this day okay okay it's not representative what you are in your inner being but it's patterned after this age but change your outward expression to one that comes from within okay and is representative of your inner being by the renewing of your mind resulting in your put into the test what is the will of God the good and well-pleasing and complete will and having found that it meets specifications place your approval on us boy that's rich so much there okay now I have a question okay this is something that God said to his prophet I did that way and it hurt him when he says it to you me hurts me but he has to say it okay oh brother Matt I loved your teaching Wednesday night awesome God bless you I'm Don you're a man okay so the question is uh you can scroll down um what is the need in US that the Lord is working on to make us him manifest in our flesh isn't that our goal isn't up to what the prophet said that the bride would be so if I manifest me and you manifest you were really missing it go on just say oh I'm just me sorry you're still missing it so well it can't be anything but what I am trying to tell you who you really are when you believe me then you'll manifest that yes that's the time that we're in so the bride must be more than just Believers in this day Brothers manifest I believe clear back going into the messages especially after this you know brother Branham says like in the token message I don't care what you believe in As Good As You Are believe until you have that token applied to you all your believing is in vain isn't that sort of a shock because I'll be honest with you I think we've been way too comfortable saying I'm a message believer and he's saying no that's not good enough anymore because he's here to help you do something you can never do yourself and he's helped you I'm here to help you I'm here to do what you can't do and that is love and he says but you've got to make a transition and turn a corner from just being a Believer to be coming up becoming as all through the rest of the message he keeps telling you he says what is the bride she is the manifested word okay so it's not just a believing I believe it but it's becoming that word itself right so here so that's what we're talking about today is this process that the Holy Spirit has in it and from there we go to the next scripture which is Hebrews chapter 10. and verse 14 through 18. now okay Hebrews 10 14 is incredible okay so let's go there this is critical to understand why the prophet preached the way he did but when you see this you will understand that what we are feeding on as a son of man Ministry is a perfect word it's absolutely scriptural it's a hundred percent scriptural and if you see messages that you don't understand I don't understand where that is in the word you just wait and say Lord in your time you'll reveal it to me but I guarantee you this you have to have the right attitude you have to have the attitude that says I know he's right and I'm wrong I know he sees and I don't because if you had the right the wrong attitude which says oh I don't believe that I don't see it in the scripture you'll never see it but you go to God with an open heart and a believing heart and say I don't see it but you know your eyes are more open than mine and I just got this little Canary brain you know and I've waited I've waited 25 years for answers in the scripture and all of a sudden they opens it up watch that attitude and watch him do that to you okay so here's one of them that just blessed me incredibly Hebrews chapter 10. verse 14 for by one offering he has perfected forever them that are Sanctified okay now I'll go on just a few verses wherever the Holy Ghost is also a witness to us for after that he said before this is the covenant What Covenant blood Covenant the New Testament is in the New Covenant is in my blood isn't that what Jesus said so here's what the blood is doing are you under the blood here's proof that you are under the blood this is the Covenant I will make with them after those days saith the Lord I will put my Liars laws in their hearts and in their what now the mind is put down too much in this day it's both okay yeah how could you have it in your heart without having it in your mind so he's taken what's out of your mind and putting his word there and that's how you know I'm under the blood because he's writing he's inscribing himself he's inscribing his word in here 's the work of the blood of Jesus right okay and in their minds I will write them and then look what he says in verse 17 read it out loud with me would you and their sins and their iniquities ever remember no more why does he say that there isn't that an interesting place to make that statement it doesn't say anything about walking to the front of the church doesn't say anything about even giving your life to the Lord which is important we know that but it says when I do this when the blood is working and the blood of Christ is effective in your life and he's inscribing his word inside my mind inside my heart then he says exactly how brother Branham taught it because he's seals are open and he says now there's the bride and she's received the word you're perfect right it's because the what is because what he the Holy Spirit did in you here now I was listening to a Christian radio station back in Minneapolis and I looked at this and uh in chapter 10 verse 14 for by one offering he hath perfected in the Greek tensor and this isn't for intellectual purposes but it really means something it's a perfect it's a done deal nothing can be added to it nothing can take away you are perfected by the blood of Jesus okay period done but then the next one okay what does he say okay for by one offering is perfected forever them see the word are sanctified that looks sort of like a past tensey word doesn't it it isn't this is what John okay oh are we okay I still haven't figured myself out is that better okay so again the word Sanctified in the Greek tense is a present progressive continuous thing that never quits isn't that interesting and when I heard that that day I went because that's exactly how brother Brandon preached now look at all of these things he tells you about you he says you're perfect you're spotless you're sinless you never did in the first place you're Justified right isn't that beautiful but I'm not done working with you and don't you forget it can you can both of those abide in me at the same time now it's exactly exactly the wave of the Brother Brad so is he scriptural yeah it's right there in the word doesn't that make you happy perfect word man I love him so isn't it interesting also now think about this it's Those whom he have perfected by his blood only those and the blood perfects because of the token the spirit the word you can't separate the blood from the word can you another one okay so this word of God is working inside of me and those that who are perfected and Justified because they receive that word inside their souls he says you know what I'm going to take that group and I'm going to do something with them I'm going to continue to sanctifying them I'm going to take him Place places that know I can't take anywhere else anybody else isn't that amazing so he's doing something with the bride that he isn't doing with anybody else and the rest of the world will say that's impossible you think you're going to be manifested Son of God oh can you believe that do you think you're going to be God made manifest huh you you guys are crazy you're going to do the works Jesus said you're really crazy oh I'll lock these guys up but those to whom the word is given he takes them and he does something different with them than he can do with anybody else in the world and here it is right there in the word of God because this is how exactly our brother Branham taught you're perfect but you're not complete you're perfect but you got to lay in the presence of the sun you're perfect but you got to ripen all these things there they are perfect word okay so this brings to mind another scripture if he uh Ephesians chapter one again going to the weast ah it's so rich I want you to know in these two verses chapter one of Ephesians in the whis translation is the message of the hour in one verse the whole message is there here it is hidden before the eyes of the wise and proven prudent but revealed unto babes that we'll learn okay verse 9. according to the wealth of his grace which he caused to let's say were accepted in the Beloved okay and he caused a super abound not abound super abound to us in the sphere of wisdom every wisdom and understanding having made known to us the mystery of his will according that which seemed good to him which good thing he purposed in himself his purpose with respect to the administration of the completion of the epox of time that's us that's here that's now this is the time and what's he going to do in this time fulfill the message of the hour no not learn it not learn it become it you with me and here's what it is this is the message okay and the completion of the epochs of time to bring again to their original state all things in Christ can you believe that's in the Bible it's right there in Ephesians it's right there in the in the message and the whole message is right there isn't that the message Christ is the mystery of God revealed and all the rest of them isn't that what he's talking about here it is in the Bible don't you love it bring back to their original state okay I gotta keep moving so I'm gonna finish so Hebrews 10 14 and Ephesians is exactly what brother Branham preached he's a word Prophet preaches the Bible even if they can't see it it's the Bible and it's there and it's perfect so part one here is I want you to know that there's a work continuing on he hasn't left us he loves us amen you're perfect by the blood but you are not finished work by the spirit and that's very scriptural and can they be yes they can be and they are so a couple things that brother Brenham says and we're going to go yep there we go one thing he wants us to do again this is part one we're perfected by the blood but we're not a finished work so in the message God God's only provided place of worship Steve you were mentioning this yesterday okay I believe the church is beginning to hear the message this is 1965 August isn't it Jason yep so he knew brother Bradham was very aware of what the people were not hearing but because it wasn't time right but let me tell you it's time Now's the Time isn't it okay and begin to understand begin to understand but friends listen we got to there it is lay in the presence of well if I'm perfect why do I need to do that you're perfect but I'm not done working with you because I need to mature you to make you me okay we got to lay in the presence of the sun we've got to be ripened then once they say our faith isn't ripe is that the truth yeah intellectually we're hearing the message of God that God has given us and seen the signs that he showed us and proven it by the Bible is there oh how the church needs to lay in the presence tell it amen something happens yeah tenders up gets what where there you go so it can do what you know that's sort of interesting isn't it you got some cleaning up kids yeah but I can't clean up with that rotten Spirit right it fits right in doesn't it something's got to happen in my spirit something has to happen in my spirit so that I can bathe down okay so sometimes in the message you get harsh you have to break it in like that because you've got a cleansing nail to make it hold but when the church once gets it he's telling me something really big here when the church once get it gets it I think we're just starting to the elected is called out and separated then in the presence of God now listen something's going to happen when I get it really get it some there's a transforming power that happens in me that makes me look different and act different talk different walk different today amen and I'm going to be thinking like Jesus and talking like Jesus and doing the works of Jesus and the things of the world I'm oblivious to because I'm walking in a world with God Alone right isn't that what he says I know it'll be something like the people was there you are going to be already there's a thing happening that you're not going to be there and be changed like he tells us you're already going to be changed here like those that are already there so we all have to ask that question where am I with you am I playing Church oh I'm a Believer yeah that's good but that's just the beginning take another step he's making the transformation now from becoming Believers to becoming becomers you have to become the word manifest not just believe the word amen okay so here you're perfect but I'm still working with you and I don't know about you but I'm really glad and that's the best thing you got going for you right now is that the spirit hasn't left you because you go out there and look around you and talk to people go to your workplace go to the grocery store and start talking about what the word is doing and they'll look like you mm-hmm deer in the adelites right yeah but you say hey God's working in me and he's making me him he's doing what you are both get used to it that's okay okay now so that's one thing here's the next thing this is from the message perfect faith and he comes to the end of the message and he says watch a perfect God I'm don't go into the middle of it with the perfect heart keep a perfect Promise by his perfect word which is sharper than here it goes to Hebrews 4 12. isn't that interesting something in my perfection has something to do with Hebrews 4 12. isn't that interesting so it's not just I have a knowledge that there's three parts of me there's something that the holy spirit is doing in those three parts and has to do in those three parts that he did with the prophet because he's saying why are you expressing something that doesn't reflect your inner soul amen why are you acting like the world why are you acting somebody like everybody else that just reflects your human spirit you with me okay which is sharper than a two-edged sword and a discerner of the thoughts of the heart what we're coming down to that Perfection because the people who look at this has to come to that and over for the rapture so I'm not there yeah that's why we're here I have a question for you aren't you getting tired of being here wouldn't you like to get home yeah then he needs to do these things because these are the things he says need to be done right okay look at what he says that's read it out loud with me what's holding it away right now is waiting for the church to come into that perfect raptured Faith looking for it look at what it says it means a lot of Shaving down for a being it means a lot for you but together we'll make it by the grave all right who wants to be shaved Save Me Lord shave it up okay that's like Hebrews 12 he's going to shake everything off of it that isn't him yes yes no here's the problem we have heard too many things for too many years to not have it happen how many years have you heard these things how many decades some of us yeah so that's where the message that is the rising of the sun says there's a quickening power here now we need to tap into that because the things that we've heard for so long were just bumps on the log why haven't they taken effect why aren't we being changed because we're playing Church do you know that you are sitting in one of the most dangerous places that there is is the church and the one that can help you the most but is also the most dangerous because you can feel like I come here I do my duty oh it's Wednesday I go to church oh it's Sunday I go to church so what what do you do on Monday morning and Tuesday and where is the word debt and how many messages have you heard this week and why not because I'm interested in nothing listen let me tell you something very painful you do what you want to do you make time for what you want to make time for you well where's the word in that oh well by the time I have time for that I'm too tired and I fall asleep oh really do you understand me before God and say I just you're down on my list of things of importance to me God have mercy listen you can take these things as a threat Mino Hoffman's up here challenged us and telling how evil we are and how bad we are or you can take it as Oh you mean you want to do that in me too and I haven't let you you mean you love me that much that you're working with me you want to do these things with me huh that's up to you how you take it yes but I'm praying that through the hardness of the things I have to say this morning you would be encouraged because sometimes you give your kids a whooping because they need it right there's nothing like you know my wife used to say to my kids I love you too much to let you act that way and you know what else she would say I want other people to like you and if you're a brat nobody's going to want you around right is that true so we have a Divine parent don't we he says I'm not going to let you act that way I love you too much so thank you Lord he turns us over okay all right um from the message North or not this is 1965. August right before he's done at Jeffersonville forever okay and at the beginning of the message and at the end of the message he tells us why we're not gone yet okay let's think of the loudest in church age and it's condition day today as far as I know I don't see anything to hinder at this time the coming of the Lord Jesus outside of what okay go look in the mirror so I'm holding the upload true or not true all right then what do you want to do and what are you waiting to do and what am I not allowing you to do that's holding us all here 1965 right at the end of the message at the end of his life okay then at the end of the same message he says what are we coming here for your church what are you what are we doing are we coming playing the game are we coming here may meeting as a lodge I told you this is a dangerous place you can feel spiritually comfortable by here and being dead as a doornail in your soul okay that is a door nail something's got to be going on on the inside something's got to be churning something's got to be correcting every day that word wasn't for me that thought wasn't from me that action wasn't for me I'm sorry Lord I'm sorry I want you I want your thoughts right okay the church Christ can't come until that church is perfectly right he's waiting on us I believe we're at the end well this was 1965. so where are we from the message it is the rising of the sun okay notice it was a force he talks about the wave sheep offering that that's very rich because that what happened When It Was Elijah and Elisha okay so Elisha asks Elijah I want a double portion now Jason my theologian why did Elijah tell him yet of see him go what did that have to do with it Steve you got to see me go or you get nothing well that's sort of dumb if it's mine to have why can't I just have it why do I have to watch her go isn't that interesting brother Branham talks about it now it's very interesting when you saw him when he get a double portion okay now it's very very interesting in Acts chapter one Jesus was with the Saints there for about 40 days before he was taken up I think it says right and then he says they watched him go that interesting they saw him go and what happened brother Bradham says a double portion but the Holy Spirit came down yeah right yeah keep your eyes on him and you have to keep your eyes on him now there's this he says this happened in this day the spirit of the Lord waved over the people and he says here it is but this time it's a mature inward that's a maturing spirit all right is that what he said are you maturing it's Grace every day isn't it that's why they had to wave the sheep for it was the first one to come to maturity and it was waived as a memorial of Thanksgiving to God believing that the rest of them would come it was a sign yeah okay it was a sign so say it out loud Steve I'm coming to majority there you go not because of what you are but because of who you are that seed inside okay all of these quotes I'm telling you yes you're perfect no I'm not done with you yes I gotta work it doesn't take away your Perfection right but it's still saying I'm you're not mature you're not where I want you to be okay so that's why I'm doing all of these quotes um again I'm going back to the the message just to bring this in uh perfect faith we're perfect by a perfect word which is sharper than a two-edged sword and watch a perfect God with a perfect heart keep a perfect promise to his children who he perfected by a perfect word that is sharper than a two-edged sword and a discerner of the thoughts of the heart he's referring to Hebrews 4 12. now we go to part two where was it that our God worked in his prophet and why and where he must do the same work for me and you okay now I'm if you think of and you go home and study there's three messages that I would like to give you where all of these things are expounded on exponentially those three messages are March of 1962 the greatest battle ever fought please remember that okay both both of the next two are in 1965 in Jeffersonville his last month there before he goes and then never comes back next one is thinking mansfelder and the last one is north and not so remember those three three messages and please okay now I'm ready for sketch one Whoever has that okay the greatest battle this is so common okay we all know this is kindergarten stuff Body Soul and Spirit we know the scripture talks about this what have you done with it what have you done with your knowledge of that well I know that I'm Body Soul Spirit okay then go to sketch two here here's the thing that brother Bradham starts in the message greatest battle ever fought and he tells you where does that battle take place everybody knows that right where's the greatest battle ever here okay now in that message brother Branham refers to this and he talks about our own solar system isn't that interesting okay and he says see all those channels okay now he he names of course the Realms of the flesh see Phil see feels smell taste here to contact this world you need it you live in it you have to contact this world okay but you have a human spirit and that human spirit that conglomerate right there is what the world would say that's your mind and brother Brandon breaks up that parts of your mind and he says okay you have conscience imagination reasoning affection and Imagination he says do you know what happened to those uh you should have been here for Sunday School okay hybrid Satan has plugged up every one of those channels he says there are flus that have been stopped up so as long as my reasoningness is plugged up by Satan then God can't throw he really has a hard time getting through my reasoning true or wrong true what about my conscience what about my imagination huh teenagers you got imaginations that are going wild right oh how about this teenagers what about your affections because your affections are so plugged up by the devil that he makes something attractive and dangles it out from you and we just right because Satan is using that affection and not God Amen and you know what that leads to pain I'm sure always correct okay so that that's what I wanted to get he said no what's the matter I'm going to just read the last part of the quote from the greatest battle ever fought that refers to this well that's the way matter with so many blowed up Christians he talks about those channels as a flu in a boiler and it's all plugged up so the boiler just explodes that's some what's the matter with so many excuse me blowed up Christians is because they don't clean the channels out they don't go down it does they don't go down to the inside you've got to clean it you've got to clean it your conscience your memory your thoughts laying aside everything and coming from the inside out we see an unadulterated word of God so the what is he telling you he said I have no place in my reasoning for the word once plugged up but what's God's he says I only want my word in your reasoning yeah I only want my word in your conscience I only want my word in your imagination I only want my word in your affections you say I can't do that what does he say to you I know it it's about time you do it too right you can't do it I never asked you come on did he ever ask you to let me do it yeah yeah let me let my love come in and do what you could never do right okay next sketch is what he says in the message um thinking Mansfield or 1965 and he's talking about the denominational person the religious person and he says everything that they processes from the outside in so they their likes and then they go from their likes to their reason and their conscience and then then they'll take that word and say well that doesn't fit with my reasoning I I think and so it can't go down to their soul it's stuck there yeah do you understand that how much of our life have we processing through your reasoning and conscience and Imagination and affection Right and he said you know what you will never go in the Rapture that way so we cannot be like those people he's talking about in thinking man's filter and process things from the outside in those channels have to be cleaned and it's got to be turned around now okay um from the message thinking man's filter the soul is drawing your resource resource through the outside down through the spirit into the soul wrong direction and then the Soul listen what he says the soul that loves the world that's dead yeah I don't care how how it's anointed okay it's out here and it's how righteous it is out here down here it's dead ouch but thank you Father I needed that spanking okay so keep working with me Lord it's the only hope you got it's the only hope I got yeah that is working with us in this day sketch number four there we go you notice I I'm taking this this three circles and I'm putting the outside Circle up on top why hold your babies right that's the only thing that they have to deal with is see taste feel smell in here right so as a as our age as we get older like to the age of accountability then below that is the second but that's why we have to be so careful brothers and sisters a little tiny child is Led wow I'm hungry wow I'm dirty right what I'm what I want to taste what I want to feel governs their whole being correct right and I can look at people out in the world that are still living that way true or not true age of accountability you all of a sudden the reasoning starts to take effect but it's plugged by Satan right yeah conscience imagination affection all of those but they're a mess okay and then way down inside is a soul okay here's the thing all of our message life all of us have heard brother Branham say that rapturing faith lies in the tapes right I'm not kidding you know I I'm old I'm 75 almost 76. I'm so thick-headed but he's still working on me and I'm telling you brothers and sisters if he can get to me he can get to any of you you know so I heard that because I believed it because he said it but just this last year and a half or two I'm experiencing it and I'm seeing things you know we would never know the things we know without the spirit of the Lord coming to this age to fulfill his scripture I have to get these things to my kids because it's going to help them I have to get these things to the kids to show them how much I love them I have to get these things to the kids to say I'm going to tell you who the real you is because you were deceived by Satan thinking the real you as something rotten think about that okay so here is Hebrews 4 12. where God came in this day and decided his it's time for you to know I'm going to divide your soul in spirit okay and it's not just standing as the prophet did so beautifully by the spirit of God in the discernment Discerning the thought that no listen to these things the love of God revealing not only his true identity to you but yours also your true identity he has blessed us and has equipped us to become him manifested same as he did his prophet he hears the real you here's the true you what our God is revealing to us about us that's love okay now this is from thinking man's filter again the love of God okay he says notice the word cannot deny itself then it's satisfied or its desire it's a desire of what what made you desire in the first place because down in your soul there was a predestinated seed that was eternal life always laying there always in there all that the father has given me will come to me there isn't any of them going to be lost don't you love that what did you have to do with that inside of the inside that was that could only do one or two things there you go it says yes or no I'm going to ask each one of your question you've had trouble you've had things in your life and you think I'm going insane it's because of this battle going on between your soul and your spirit okay and you have always been convinced by the devil that what you think and what is going on in that realm that's the real you ask you a question down deep inside whenever you've heard the word of God did you ever say no to it because you couldn't because that's the real you that other isn't the real you know and here's what the brother brought him so beautifully is trying to tell us I want you to know who the real you is okay now where am I okay yeah here's another one if that Soul hasn't come from God it can make all the impersonations but it cannot be real okay you can act healing you can act like you have and be ever so good at it but that don't mean you're saved that's exactly right the spirit can be real genuine Holy Spirit can anoint you doesn't mean you're saved it's that inside Soul That Never Dies it's got eternal life it always was eternal life it come from God and it goes to God you came from God in your soul and you go back so you have part of you that's eternal awesome now if that's the case why am I going crazy because of what's going bouncing around in my head do you remember the old-fashioned pinball machines you ever feel that way yeah go get on your knees to pray and all of a sudden bound and there's no right it just goes everywhere and you think well Lord I'm sorry you think well then the devil's right there on your shoulder how do you think you can be a son of hard because the Son of God would never think those things isn't he good yeah God's better so God come along and you know what he said you know let me tell you about her that's not you I'm going to give you the true identification the real you came from me and the real you is a part of me and the real you has never done anything your whole life but say Amen to this word isn't that wonderful yeah isn't that a gift no wonder he says rapturing faith lies in these tapes huh without these Revelations of these last day we wouldn't have Rapture in faith but it's given to us oh I used to have a sister a dear friend of ours from New Mexico her name was Verdi Smith you've ever heard somebody by the name of Birdie oh she was special do you know what she used to tell me Hoffman get your head down in that word and don't come up for error and she meant it often don't get your head down in that word and don't come up for air yes sister she knew I needed it and I did at the time yeah okay so that what brother Branham said is absolutely scriptural John 5 24 truly truly I say unto you whosoever hears my word and believes him who sent me has eternal life now we'll get it now we'll die and go to heaven and live eternally no you have eternal life and because you have this eternal life in you you believe the word of God right who's the real you is the real you your spirit no okay what about the outside parts now here's the main thing we're going to the next one that's a from the message North and not now this outside man is the flesh brother branham's doing the three circles Body Soul and Spirit okay and the outside man is the flesh that's what we look at that's what we see five inlets to that body any grammar school child and myself would know that there's five senses to control the body skip that's the only way you can have a body see taste feel smells here now what does he say that is the what unaware so you're sort of a mess not really God designed it that way okay so that's the evil one now on the side of that go on there we go this is the important one I know you've read this but I want this to sink into you today now the inside is that Spirit which you become when you're born of the earth and the Breath of Life breathed into him that spirit is of a what you were born with it listen because it was look at this not given from God but was permitted by God so you have a spirit that was never part of God it's of a worldly nature but he said I'm going to permit that to go in you well that's sort of Me no come on you God God is love and he's doing everything perfectly and he's going to work it out but he's going to say do you know what the most freeing thing for me in this day is is for the Holy Spirit to say look at your conscious look at what's going on in your imagination look what's going on in your reason oh Lord they drive me crazy and what does the Holy Spirit saying in this day that isn't isn't it the real you is the soul that came from me the real Soul the real you is the soul from that's part of me the real you is the thing that always says amen don't you love that identification so your spirit is not really that's not part of God he just permitted it okay it's what drives me nuts don't identify with the brothers and sisters identify with what the brother brought him says the real you y-o-u soul that came from God it's a part of God it came from him and it's going back to him right the thing that says amen that's the real you yeah what a gift for the Bride of Jesus Christ tell me that doesn't make a difference because you need that to know I can have rapturing faith now you know your true identity my identity is his word my identity is his Spirit my identity is him made manifest that's me I can't get away from it oh I got this part that drives me crazy yeah that's not you but you don't have an excuse to let that control you because the scripture says sin shall not have dominion over me okay so here's the question who or what is the real you notice how the prophet phrased that that person inside there okay going back to that quote look at it let me read it again the spirit is of a worldly nature because it's not given from God but it was given and permitted by God now you got that every child that's born in the world is born in sin shaped in iniquity come to the world speaking lies that right so look at that that person inside there is a sinner to begin with that person inside there that soul okay that's not the real you yeah the real you okay the soul inside that is the real you so God had to bring deliverance from that rule of the false identification that gained control and bondage over you saying that's that's me because I think those things Satan is there the Son of God wouldn't think that way and what happened to your faith when you received that thought well I can't have Rapture in faith well I'm just stuck here I'm a mess okay that's why this is critically important what brother what God did with brother Branham so to deliver the prophet Hebrews 4 12. had to become flesh and blood for the word of God is quick and Powerful sharper than any two-edged sword piercing even to the dividing asunder of the Soul and Spirit and the joints in the mirror and as the discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart I want you to listen now this is hard but man is it good from the message North and not I want you to listen to our Prophet tell us how God had to separate his soul from his spirit so what he's trying to do with us this morning from the rule of his own spirit I want you to look how it was piercing and cutting and dividing even to the joints in the marrow from the outsard look at the where's the life nurses Merrell what do they why do they give marrow transplants huh this is a life in the bone structure or in the marrow in the marrow right from the outside framework has to be separated from the life of the framework he's in the hospital telling this story he just left the room where his wife died is going to the room whereas babies dying he says I sat there and I thought oh god what have I done you're a good God why did you let her die the other day me holding her two little arms like that begging him for her and why'd you let her go there's Billy lying there dying and she was dying what have I done tell me well I made well just go with him he wanted to die also I opened the door and no nurse was there I slipped down into the basement that was before the hospital was fixed screens no screens no windows hardly and then he flies flies on her eyes had a piece of mosquito bar we call it netting put over her face I shoot the Flies off laid their little eyes suffered so much till they were crossing then Satan moved by the side of me and said did you say he was a good God reasoning human spirit I said yeah I said that did you say he was a Healer Consciousness reason imagination well why did your father Die In Your Arms over there and you calling him a sinner calling for his life why did your brother die in your other brother's arms out there and you standing in the Pulpit preaching a few weeks ago why did he why didn't he answer you you said he loved you you said he saved you he couldn't tell me there was no God because I already seen him but he was telling me he didn't care for me oh yeah isn't he good at that listen I've been plagued with that my whole life he's loved but he doesn't love me I couldn't you know said so there lays your wife your babies will be there pretty soon your daddy is buried your brothers buried your wife is going to be buried now tomorrow and here's your other baby he's a good god he's a Healer you met him made a sap out of yourself William Brandon now this next sentence bun me around and has held me captive for two years I know of no other place in the message where our Prophet tells us why you had to go through what he went through why God in 1937 says I'm not going to let you continue in your ministry until something changes and he puts something from the Lord as heartbreaking think of it piercing dividing cutting paragraph 199 read it out loud with me would you what did it do from it was working from the outside now there it is do you know that's what he has to do with every one of us he would not allow his Prophet to continue as long as he could be influenced by his own reasoning and his own Consciousness and his own imagination because listen to me God cannot be preeminent until he's preeminent in my conscience and he's preeminent in my thinking and my thinking is it's his thinking and my reasoning to see his reasoning and his word is a ruling not me and if the prophet would not allow him to go and continue in that Ministry and tell no that's got to be cleaned out what about me what about you what about us where we're at right today yeah and what stands before you in the Rapture is this is one of them why the church isn't ready this is one of them because you've identified yourself with the wrong thing number one oh the things that are going on your brain oh that's the real me no it isn't it yeah the real you is your soul the real you is the thing that says Amen to me but you believe that was the real you and so he comes today and he says you know that thing that Spirit your mind you know your reason your imagination that wasn't you that isn't even from God he just permitted it there but brother Branham used his own logic and he used his own reasons the Mother-in-law you know you're not going to take my daughter to those people oh yeah well maybe you're right maybe do you understand that what that costume yeah do you know the heartache that that brought him let me ask you something when God did this and him do you know what kind of a man he got and when he does this to me and to you do you know what a bride you'll have you'll have a bride that reflects him oh lose your identification of your spirit and gain the identification of your soul the part that came from God that goes back to God but brothers and sisters I want you to think about something that's the most amazing statement where the Prophet could say that what did that do all my heartache ah come on yeah you lose your wife you lose your baby you lose your brother you lose your dad all at the same time what did it do it was working from I was controlled by this outside no more you still didn't learn perfectly because he's human that was in 1937 wasn't it we are still governed Jason aren't we by Logic and reason 1953 he's in Africa South Africa and that's the meetings that uh all these different ministers arranged for him now brother Branham spoke to him in dreamers there he says I want you to quit I want you to go hunting for two weeks with Sydney Jackson isn't that right and then you'll come back and you'll have meetings like Beyond imagination now Jason you're an organizer and the prophet just called you and said Jason I'm coming to the United States and we're gonna you're gonna take me on tour around the Eastern United States so you were arranged so if you were arranging for the prophet you would say okay I need to put I need to call and make arrangements with this facility and this stadium and this Arena and this Racetrack and whatever and okay Jason we'll do that what date would you like it on I'd like it on such and such a date okay the deposit will be okay and so all those brother Branham told all of those ministers the holy spirit said no I want you to go hunting for two weeks yeah tell me that wouldn't break your brain for real right tell me that wouldn't drive you crazy how much money did you just put down on all those places now here's a question that's totally unreasonable is it is the holy spirit here to be reasonable that's totally illogical is the holy spirit here to be logical he might tell you something totally unreasonable totally illogical and he's expecting you to do it then finally brother Bradham says I you know look at what these guys have done how I'm going to mess up they'll never want me back ever logic logic reason reason right he says go ahead listen to him they just suffer for it what happened when he got he got the amiibo look at the dates I think it's about six months at least from October to March spring he's so sick he thinks he's dying this is when he went to the Mayo Clinic okay and they said sorry nothing we can do and he said okay I'm dying and he learned he even told me he says get the kids ready you're going to be on your own all right he thought he was dying yeah finally One Night in a vision I think the Lord appeared on the wall some fruit was it or something apples or and he knew he was healed I guarantee you after that you would never listen to this again 1953 watch his life after that okay that he had to be separated from the rule of the human spirit and until God separates us from the rule of our human Spirit he cannot have the real preeminence stop and think about that amen is this my thinking I'm not preeminent sorry yeah stop and think about this brothers and sisters hard to understand but man what God got in that man yeah what a character yes Jesus Christ Ministry again repeated in the end times so for be and for you and to give us these things that are a reality and your give us our true identification that you can be free once and from all from Satan you telling you and pointing to the things that you're thinking when it's really him hey there's there's a place in COD Volume 2 where somebody asked brother Branham the question and says um how do I know if it's Satan's thinking or if it's me thinking do you remember reading that do you know what brother Branham says if it's a word it's God yeah and if it's not the word of Satan do you know what he just told you you don't even have anything yeah because we're all influenced by other dimensions we know that okay so you asked the question was this really the love of God to break a man's heart yes in the mind of the in the realm of the human Spirit you will never figure that out it may be logical okay but in your soul something makes sense right Jay it is eternal love that only that which comes from eternity can grasp stop and think about that so what about me and you brothers and sisters what about all the trials and heartaches you've gone through maybe they'll make sense to you maybe you'll understand I is moving he's trying to move me to the Inside Man that the soul would finally take its place of preeminence so God could be preeminent in my life he allows us to go through those things for a purpose is he not working the same things out in me and you is he not transforming us from men and women who would just believe to be men and women who are flesh of his flesh and bone of his bones life of his life power of his powers that my brother Bradham did he not become us that we might become him His Image his likeness that we have to have his mind yeah there's another whole sermon I want you to think about something as I close here and this is the grace and mercy of God Romans chapter 4 talks about Abraham who staggered not at the promises of God through faith but with strong giving praise to God brother Bradham tells us that Romans was the account that God saw and that's what God saw why didn't God see or hear oh that Ishmael might live before you finally dawned on me after this because that wasn't the real Abraham think about that Jake that was just a spirit that didn't come from me the real Abraham was his soul that said amen to everyone that beautiful God bless you brothers and sisters God be with you build you edify you every day we're here we're here for a reason but I'm telling you if we're holding them up let's quit holding him up let's get out of here I want to go home really bad don't you if he's waiting on the church then the church ought to be moving into those realms where eternity is in control amen love you all God bless you praise the Lord brother Tony he's taking us from walking by sight to walking by faith brother Caleb sister Joy walking by faith right our circumstances sometimes we have things presented in front of us let's let's stand we have things presented in front of us and trials and tribulations and God is saying I'm taking you from this realm to another realm from a realm of sight to a realm of faith and that faith has to be become our sight right you don't see you don't see a sickness you don't see a damaged person you don't see uh what is maybe in front of you or the possibilities but you see with God's promise and the reality is we're not just becoming Believers of that promises Brother Don was speaking about us but we're becoming that promise that promise is becoming a part of us and we're becoming a part of that and we're an expression of it and so regardless of the circumstances you fit you face there's a promise of God for you and you you know you can look at that and you could say but I had this terrible thing happen or I did this terrible thing that's not the real you it's there's a as brother Brandon said down inside of there there was another William Branham and he says that was the real William Branham right inside of you there's a real brother Jack Amen and that real brother Jack is growing and growing and permeating your entire being until that hey we're being made ready for a Rapture right at that time Body Soul and Spirit it's all perfectly of what God had in his mind before the foundation of the world but right now that word has to permeate it has to the Bible says work out your own salvation with fear and trembling carry your own salvation out to its ultimate end its ultimate conclusion its ultimate purpose why because God is working in you both to Will and to do of his good pleasure amen let's pray father oh Lord God we're so thankful for these things Lord I pray Lord that those may be struggling facing trials the outside is is is bothering them and and maybe there's there's just horrible pain that they're going through I pray that they would see this that they would hear the word that was preached today and see that it's it's a loving God bringing a circumstance to bring you to that place where the real you is being expressed that Gene of God that seed of God that's in the soul so that we're not governed by by our circumstances we're not governed by our thoughts about our circumstances but we're governed by the word becoming the word thank you Lord bring it bring healing bring rests bring peace in every Heart Lord we ask it in Jesus name [Music] amen let's Worship the Lord I want to see you amen Open the
