name of the lord my god is so good isn't he praise god we're happy to have you here in the house of the um green means go okay switch to this right here yeah this is why you'll always see me when i get up here and song leaders push this over i always stand it back up for that reason so that if this contraption fails this contraption uh will pick it up amen amen praise the lord i found out they can't leave it on i told them they should leave it on all the time but they said they can't do that because it creates a loops of some kind so amen over my head but anyway those brothers seem to have it all together but we're happy to be here tonight happy to have you all in the house of god amen we're gonna go right to the scripture we're really on a tight schedule tonight and i gotta i gotta set the set the standard amen i've put these other brothers under a strict guideline and and so uh i kind of didn't put myself under one but but uh anyway i i kind of did kind of didn't kind of did left it left it and left me a little bit of wiggle room but i would like to move right along uh we're going to have the order the way we're going to do it is i'm going to take this opening segment um and i added a few minutes to my to my part but then we're going to go straight to the communion now that's a little different for us we're going to go i'm going to preach that list a little bit we're going to go straight to the communion and then immediately after the communion service we're going to hear from our other brothers and then when they go through their portions then we will dismiss for the foot washing for those who can stay it'll be starting to get a little late by then but we're trying not to get you out very late at all i'm aiming i'm aiming at 9 30 we'll see how that how close to that we can get but uh that wouldn't be too bad if we slip out and did foot washing and then come back in just for a dismissal prayer amen does that sound all right praise the lord so god bless you first thessalonians chapter 1 amen praise the lord get to use my new bible for the first time and uh i love it my it's uh i never had a spurgeon bible with his annotations and notes and outlines never had that before so i really appreciate that i was going to start there at verse 1 but i tell you what brother caleb let's just drop down and read verse 5 for our gospel came not unto you in word only but also in power and in the holy ghost and in much assurance that's a lot isn't it look at it again didn't come in word only but here's what came with the word power and in the holy ghost and in much assurance as you know what manner of men we were among you for your sake father we thank you for your word tonight i ask now that you bless it mightily lord let it go to all peoples now as we have definitely a feeling on our heart to go in this direction and been thinking on it lord for weeks now coming to just a little short time in your word as we lord the word prepares our hearts so we wouldn't want to just jump straight into uh the communion we want to have at least a little bit of the word lord to uh to add on to what the worship service has been able to accomplish and have hearts and minds prepared to receive your supper we commit it to you in jesus name god bless you friends you can be seated one of the things that i had said to the brothers they were just looking you know wondering what um i had on my heart on my mind as far as you know kind of a list a little bit of a pointer for them tonight what out what kind of was the vision of my heart and i i just i just said to them brothers whatever is on your heart that the lord would impress amen you know you might reflect a little bit about the the year that's passed and correlate that to the year coming you know i i thought to myself that if i were to do that tonight i don't want to really spend much time uh thinking about this past year other than to say i'm grateful to god amen to be here tonight with you i'm grateful to god for what he's done in our lives friends i'm so thankful to the lord and i'm glad uh for what we were able to accomplish uh the word went forth amen people were healed sick people were healed lost people found christ many have found a deeper experience with the lord in their lives i've spent this whole year hearing testimony after testimony of the great things that god did i i trust that our our young people are still reveling in the meetings that we held amen as this year goes out and the things that god did for you at that time don't forget it don't let it don't let it just pass by uh absorb what god did for you during that time you know i one of the last thing that i thought that i might say concerning this past year jesus made this statement how that he says when ye shall have done all those things which are commanded you say here's what you say you don't say i'm going to disney world like the world does they get some big accomplishment i'm going to disney world you know we're not here to to brag about our accomplishments jesus said it's a little hot whoever's on the mic for me that's a little hot at least up here it is anyway so likewise ye when ye shall have done all those things which are commanded you say we are unprofitable servants we have done that which was our duty to do i just think that that's a perfect um attitude adjustment amen if if you know we're coming to a communion service and i'm just thinking lord what what could i ponder what could i put my mind on that would give me the kind of humility and the kind of sincerity that i need and i think luke 17 10 is a very good place to start when we've done all that we all that we have been asked to do everything that god asked you to do in 2022 now i'm not going to ask you for a show of hands and i hope you don't ask me i'm not going to ask for a show of hands for everybody that did everything god asked them to do in 2022 please don't ask me and i won't ask you don't ask don't tell okay all right but that's a bad analogy [Laughter] but i i think i'm thankful to god that i can stand here today and say lord you know i i you asked me to do things i didn't get them all done but even if i had i want to have the kind of humility that stands in your presence tonight and say lord i owe you everything i got nothing coming i only did what was my duty and i'm not even sure i did a great job on that but but i know this he did a great job i know this that the bible says let the weak we all feel weak at times let the weak say i'm strong what you ought to say is i i can do all things through christ who strengthens me that's what i want to take into 2022 that's what i want to take into the new year to say i i'm not going to base it on my 2021 record because if i based it on that i probably come up short again but i'm going to say no i'm going to let that go i'm going to count it to the lord i'm going to ask for his mercy and i'm going to press into the new year with a new vigor and a new zeal and say lord i want to i want to hit every mark i want to check every box that you ask of me in this year and he's asking quite a bit because we're in a day and we're in an hour friends very serious brother branham makes a number of statements and i'm going to read through a bunch of quotes here very quickly i would have put them on the screen but it would have slowed me down brother madam talks about when he was in in india the methodist bishop and many of them come over to meet me said brother branham we heard these things we preached the word we know more about theology perhaps and all the americans put together and because the bible is an eastern book and i said and that's right i said but we want to see someone anointed with the holy spirit and here it is that can make it live again that's that's the theme of what i want to say to you tonight going into 2022 i want to see the word live again see somebody that can make it live again that's it we want somebody who can produce what the bible says it will do otherwise we want to see the faith in other words he's saying we want to see the faith that was once delivered to the saints now if you're wondering what kind of church they had in the days of the apostles they made the word live how many want that so now i'm i'm wanting to go forward but i'm wanting uh uh i'm wanting a rerun of that a very early day in the day ahead of us i'm looking out at it ahead of us and i say lord let this be the most apostolic year that bethel tabernacle has ever enjoyed to see the power of god moving to see people's lives being changed you don't realize friends what an impossibility that is in the day and hour that we live in he goes on he says here in 1955 here in 63 the world falling apart we've already got it god god gave it to us it's his promise for this hour we look in the bible we see it everywhere through the bible anointed ones come anointed ones come on and made that word live again right in the hour for that hour we've got messiah this is him he holds up his bible this is him the word in the beginning was the word it was with god was god and the and it remains god hebrews 13 8 same yesterday day and forever we know what's supposed to take place in this day we're wanting a messiah and god gave us the messiah his promised word for this day don't undervalue the promised word that's the messiah coming to you in this hour listen friends if you can really get your minds wrapped around that fact say i want to see the coming of the lord you're right in the big middle of it so i want to see messiah that he's come in his revealed word you're not waiting to see messiah he's already among us he's literally finishing up the last portion to do what change our body bring the saints out of the grave take us to the sky hallelujah i i never i never thought i would see 2022. i never wanted to see 2022. but if i'm going to see it i'm going to tell you something i want to put my foot to the floor and take this thing at high speed and i want to say lord maybe this will be the last year and if i go across the finish line i want to be running full speed hallelujah that's what your pastor that's my vision for 2022 friends he says somebody to anoint it and make it live again yes sir it's a real messiah it's the word of god both heavens and earth will pass away my words are never passed away he goes on there in 63 there's a manner that can turn on the light sometimes the grain lays in the earth dormant all through the winter like winter wheat sowed in the ground but when that sun gets just right oh it's to live see and it can't live without the sun and god has made promises for every age and every day and when the light gets right and shines upon that it'll produce now listen it's not i'm not here saying you got to go produce it the word in you has the power to produce itself that's what brother branham taught us it you you have you have that which is everything you have needed for a rapture is in you now all it's got to be brought is into the presence and the atmosphere of messiah and it'll it'll bring that winter it might have been dormant it might have been winter but i'm here to tell you the sun is just in the right position it's going home time and you should have an expectation that your life can match the promise of this hour if you're a believer because you've got the seed of the seed of god in you you've got the word for this hour we've got the time met prophecy what's to hinder us friends see we let the devil sometimes uh get us in this mindset that oh nothing's changing nothing's happening there's plenty happening and there's opportunity glory i want to really emphasize that tonight there is opportunity aplenty for god to move in your life and god made a promise for every age and every day and when the light gets right and shines upon it it'll produce just exactly what the word said because he is the light and the life so so i would ask you a question tonight what are you looking for what are you looking for are you looking for a new year to just be like the old one i don't want it to be like the old one say well a lot of good things happen i didn't go in the rapture i wouldn't mind a repeat of all the good things i wouldn't mind avoiding all the bad things but i didn't get to go on the rapture i'd like to go in the rapture i like for 2022 to be the best year of the bride's life hallelujah the best year in history he says in looking unto jesus 64 the mechanics don't run the church it's the dynamics the holy ghost that gets into the into this word see that's that's dynamics when the holy ghost gets into the word all right it's not a seminary that teaches you theology and greek interpretations but it's the dynamics of the holy ghost in there to set that a fire and to bring it to pass and to make it to make it to make it live just exactly what the promised word for this hour not the mechanics the dynamics it takes mechanics and dynamics the word and the spirit they are the one that gives life he says later in paradox now what is it christ coming to his bride christ is the word we all know the anointing is christ that comes on the word that makes the word live is that right congregation says amen that is the anointing christ is the anointing the spirit that comes upon the word that quickens the word to make it live now the word is in your heart you believe in divine healing whatever more we we we do we do we do believe in those things we do believe in divine healing we do believe in the power of god we do believe in the anointing of the holy ghost i believe in that stuff hallelujah he says in the oddball how many feel like an oddball to this world you can lay a seed out there on the ground no matter how much the seed is germatized and lay it there it's got to have an atmosphere to make it live now watch listen now we're turning now we're going to the next step so it's not just the season it's not just the sunlight but watch it could be dramatized but what's it got to have an atmosphere the sun has to come to a certain power before bring it to a certain atmosphere an egg has to have an atmosphere or it won't hatch no matter how fertile it is it's got to have an atmosphere now this is what i have proven to be true i can testify to you tonight friends that that when you don't keep that that seed gene of god not only the seed gene of god down in you but the seed of the word should be a constant there should be a constant intake of the word of god there should be a constant intake of the presence of god there should be a constant communion between you and the son see the son of god but when we don't keep that atmosphere of the holy ghost and we don't keep feeding on the word then i'm here to tell you something friends you live an underachiever's life you remember i said that i promise you that if you don't increase your intake of the word of god and if you don't increase your fellowship with the lord in prayer and fellowship and the assembling of the saints and the fellowship of the saints and you don't and you don't have more of that then you know what you do you're you're gonna you and you you say 2021 if i'd be honest i feel like an underachiever you'll just repeat it you'll just repeat it i'm gonna tell you something i made up my mind years ago i was done with being an underachiever i want to i want to excel i want to achieve everything that god has for me at the beginning of 22 i want a purpose to give my mind more to the word of god and the things of god and take advantage of the anointing that was prophesied for this hour see and so so you know the truth of the matter is friends i i can't make it happen for me you can't make it happen for you a prophet is here telling you god is already here to make it happen all i can do all you can do is slip into the stream of prophecy and allow your life to be to be molded to have more of the word of god more of the fellowship of god more of the anointing more of the spirit of god that's how you're going to be an overcomer in 2022 if you slip into the stream of it friends i promise you it'll carry you along you'll find yourself if if the lord tarries another year i hope he doesn't but if he does you'll find yourself at the end of 2022 saying brother jason this was a better year for me than 2021. you might make less money you might get sick more but you'll still say this was a better year for me than 2021 because i stopped being an underachiever and i started focusing my life and taking advantage of the opportunity that god has given us in this hour see when you do that friends when you step into the stream of the promise with your heart and your mind prepared then god is obligated to make all things possible to you you believe that let's say it again that's a big point when you're willing to slip into the stream and let and let all of these things come together let the the sunlight is in the right spot the word is here the people are here christ is here messiah is here and all you've got to do is slip into that stream and god will be obligated god will be obligated to make all things possible for you he says and i think in a group like this christians hatch out or are born again in such an atmosphere as this this is the kind of atmosphere i was born under no matter where i go in the world the cold world the mission fields and so forth i can even stand and close my eyes and think of this atmosphere and god's provided place of worship going fast and i think that's what's the matter with the church today we're lacking that dynamical power watch now to press this word and make it live for this day so there's a there's this notion of you pressing this notion of you getting on board this notion you can't make it happen but you can be a participant in it and that's how exactly god has always desired to do it in with and through in you all through you all above you all amen so that so that god is all in all i'm here to tell you you're in that all right you're in you're part of that or you're in there with jesus and god is wanting to make his life come forward in all he says god's provided place of worship he carries on martin luther had the mechanics and dynamics of his day john wesley had them of his day pentecost had them of their day what about our day what about it what about our day this isn't luther wesley azuza this isn't the days of brother branham and his tent meetings this isn't the day on on 8th and penn the seals are being preached you're not you're not you're not at parkview junior high and and listening to this day the scripture is fulfilled you're not you're not you're not in phoenix you're not in tucson today you're here you're not in 1963 64 65 you're at the end of 2021 what say you church what about it what about you what about me what about us it can't just be a god of history it's a god of the future hallelujah this is another time what about our day this is another time the church should be full fully grown now ready to go meet with the manifestation of every blessing that he promised in the bible operating in that one great body where he promised that he would meet the people and be worshipped in this great church of his so how so how ready should i be that's a good question how ready should i be ready to meet him that's what he says this church should be fully grown now ready to go meet christ where should you be say brother jason where should i be in my life you should be ready to meet him that's that's like that's like real time you should be ready to meet him in real time not not somewhere over rainbow but right now i'm not here you know i i i i tell you something friends i'm not here like a prophet with a gift of discernment that can discern your heart my wife and i we were coming up the road listening i said i want you to listen to this and i played her just a little clip one of my favorites and brother branham just goes into that discernment with a lady standing there and he breaks from her and breaks out over the audience and she's traveling and he's got them all in the same car and he can see me say i see all y'all and oh yeah lady you and sir you're in the same car you're coming from another country 2 000 miles away oh you come from canada and and she's got a tumor she's got a thyroid he's got a problem he's standing there with another lady who says he says that's your wife no it's not it's actually your sister and and i mean this woman here is is shock and the audience is in shock and disbelief nobody can believe my goodness what is he tied into and then he prays a simple prayer for her and then right as he comes out of his prayer then all of a sudden an urgency hits his voice and he says everybody everybody stand up quick he said the holy spirit's sweeping through the building hurry everybody in wheelchairs blind halt man whatever stand up quickly he's moving all over the building i'm here to tell you something friends oh i i may not be that prophet i'm not here with that kind of discernment but you know uh but the word is say brother jason what do i need in my life will you tell me how about you tell me how about you tell yourself what it you need you you you tell me what's the need in your life and be honest before the lord think about it right now friends be honest before the lord what is the biggest need in your life i tell you something i'm glad as brother branham says we ought to be a mature we ought to be preparing for the coming ready to meet the lord and i i'm glad that i have sown the seed i was thinking about it today i thought lord i'm glad that i've spent all these years sowing the seed of the word i've sold it in this congregation for years and i'm going to tell you something it's paying off i have a mature assembly i have people who know god who know the power of god who understand the word of god who aren't afraid to believe god for anything to reach out and take miracles oh and bring them in bring them right in among us i tell you friends you're not little children anymore i i don't have to hold your hand constantly thank the lord i told you the other sunday how proud i am of this assembly i meant it i think we have a very spiritually minded assembly you're you're a child of god you've known the lord all of these years and oh you know but but but if i come to you tonight and say well what does it mean to be ready to meet the lord well what if i said to you tonight that that suddenly like brother branham had come over him and he said everybody quickly the holy spirit's moving across the building what if i suddenly stood up here and said to you thus saith the lord it's we got 30 minutes left friends here we are we thought we were looking to 2022. guess what we're not going to make it we got 30 minutes we got 30 minutes left from now what would you want to have in place now we're dealing with the question how ready should i be you should be ready to meet the lord well what does that even mean what does that look like how ready should i actually be what if i said you only had 30 minutes and he was going to be here see now i know i got enough sense to know we got things in our life that the lord might put on our heart and say you need to make that right it might happen in this service tonight and i know 30 minutes isn't enough time to sometimes run out and fix everything that if you really thought the lord was really going to be here in 30 minutes no make that 29.5 minutes if i had some magical way to suddenly put an urgency on you to where you became convinced my goodness 29 minutes and some seconds he'll be here what you say oh you know what a lot of things that you think i don't need to go fix you might think different say oh i i'm i'm okay with my level of sincerity 2021 is good enough i don't need to be any more spiritual than that i promise you if i said you had 20 less than 29 minutes now you wouldn't think you had enough sincerity i know i wouldn't i wouldn't think i had enough sincerity and i know we can't run out and and fix everything in 30 minutes or 28 minutes or 29 minutes but you know something you could make a commitment in your heart right now that's all the thief on the cross could do he couldn't come down and go fix anything but you know what he could do he couldn't believe christ right at that spot he could have said lord remember me when you come into your kingdom oh my what what about 30 what if it was three what commitment if it was three minutes what kind of commitment would you make in your heart you got the lord's supper the communion table here before you represents the the broken body and the blood of the lord that he shed for us and i'll tell you something friends we need to come to it with a humility but we need to but you need to understand that god doesn't want you in a beat down humility god wants you in a supernatural humility god's not interested in human humility it's not about staring at your feet when you walk and dressing in a potato sack and and speaking softly that's not humility that's not always humility that's religious that's not necessarily spiritual you understand but real humility when when when brother bisical told me one time he said he asked brother branham our brother brandon ask him said brother eddie do you know what real humility is and he said i think i do brother branham he said what would you say it is and he said it's when you can say amen to every word of god i want that kind of humility friends i want that kind of humility oh what if you could hear it coming what if what if what if your senses could actually pick it up brother describes it sometimes i remember one time he described about how that what annoying thing starts coming in he said you know you're he said i'm praying and he said then i start to get a little lifted up and i keep praying and i press a little higher this is a prophet now and he said i i feel myself rising into another atmosphere and he says then i hear him coming and he now i don't understand this don't get me outside nothing to explain it any better because i don't understand any better what i'm about to tell you but he says he says i can hear it starting to roll in and he said it's coming in like one plus one is two two plus two is four and he's giving the idea it's like a it's like it's ramping up and he said and he said and then he said when that happens i just raise up my hands and he said it just sweeps me up into another realm and that's when i see visions and visions break out in front of me oh i'm going to tell you something friends i'm not here to try to duplicate a prophet's life but what if you could what if i said he'll be here in three minutes and suddenly you went i feel it i hear that and suddenly we begin to hear i'm gonna tell you the hair'd stand up on the back of your neck you'd raise up both hands you'd get up on your feet tears would roll down your face it wouldn't be fear it wouldn't be sadness it'd say on the day i've waited on all my life is now coming upon me hallelujah that's the kind of that's the kind of power that god has one of these morning's friends it's gonna sweep us into another realm oh my i wanna i wanna know what it feels like i i wanna have that warm urgency in my heart i wanna i wanna feel god moving in our lives what would be your your last thoughts or your last words as i wind up to a close here what would be your last thoughts or your last words as you felt it rushing in just when you started to feel yourself lifting up into that other dimension oh what a different service we'd have instantly even from right this minute we're sitting here in a nice air-conditioned building we're waiting to take the lord's supper but friends that that reality is just a breath away that reality is just right here it's just in another dimension it's all around us i tell you in 2022 we need to set our mind and set our focus i want to move into that realm i want to have more of that working in my life what all of those things that you're reading brother jason let me give you this final two quotes proving his word he says he is the quickening power he is the spirit the dynamics that comes into the mechanics the words that make it live it ha it and it all has to work together or it just don't work see it's so you can't just have mental assent to true teaching you can't just agree mentally that the word is accurate the word is accurate whether you agree with it or not the rapture is not depending on you to agree with it this word is accurate the message of the hour is accurate it doesn't need you or me to judge it it just needs me and you to live it amen and so it all has to work together it's got to take the whole bible the whole christ the full gospel finally he says trying to do god's service without it being his will without it being god's will 1965 old church here and across the nation listen to your humble servant will you he says look where you were a few years ago when this first started now look what impersonations has capitalized on it and great millions and billions of dollars has flown into organizations see they're they're building great big buildings and and those denominational systems that that despised brother branham reaped millions off of his ministry he poured he poured souls and people into their churches when when when churchianity was dying in america and and william branham spearheads a campaign a spearhead's a revival that sweeps around and every other global evangelist started up under him and went forward and he says then what have they done it's all just been capitalized on and it's all a bunch of impersonations and billions of dollars has flown into organizations see still away from the word of god buildings and organizations is not the way god stirs his spirit he stirs it right into his word to make it live i i love the the renovations we've done to this property i i love the ideas that we have going forward but i want to tell you something friends if we didn't have this building at all and all we had was a brush arbor you y'all know what that is hey man sister gene ask her after church she'd tell you about a brush arbor brush arbor you didn't need a building this holy ghost filled people be driving down the road there'd be a whole big thicket of something they'd just pull off the side of the road and mash all their mash it all down mash all the weeds down and it'd just be an old brush arbor and they'd get in there singing and playing a tambourine shouting and speaking in tongues and preacher jump up and sweat and spit and preach and you drive by there wow people pull over and stop ain't that right sister gene that's a brush arbor i'll tell you something friends we don't need millions of dollars in buildings we don't need this building if all we had was a brush arbor i'd still want to see the power of god in my life and your life that's what i want to see i don't need to see big buildings if we if we end up just in a field i want to know that we're out there with the power of god moving in our lives that's what it's about for me that's what 2022 as i see myself moving to it that's what i desire it to be amen god bless you as you stand with me amen praise the lord let's have our musicians come back brother matt bring your team and come back brother luther if you come and be preparing to um to to to go into the lord's supper here amen and then god bless you you're ready to take the lord's supper oh let's bow our heads father lord i i could i could have easily come lord with years and knowledge of the word of god and could have just drew me up an outline and preached some quiet you know maybe maybe some would think we we needed a a a quiet sermon we needed something to to quiet in our spirit as we get ready to go to take the lord's supper but lord i i that's not what i felt in my heart i i felt in my heart i wanted to come to this service lord with uh with uh with the prepared supper before me to say lord it it works the gospel works and we're believers and and we want to see the power of god this is what a prophet taught us that we're to expect this is what a prophet taught us where to look for we're to look for the power and demonstration of the holy spirit lord as we come to this supper may the sincerity of our heart be great may our humility lord to say amen to every word i hope there was an amen in the heart of every person here tonight lord not to i wasn't here my my whole theme as you well know father my whole theme wasn't to just pep the people up and say oh let's charge in and have a bunch of power of god the whole challenge of it was to have more of the word and the fellowship of the spirit in my life i'm not trying to make it happen i'm not trying to make anything happen you will make it happen my portion is to focus my mind give my mind more to your word give my heart more to your word give my life more to fellowship with you lord let 2022 be uh the greatest year that we could say at the end of the year i had the greatest fellowship i i achieved the greatest closeness to god that i ever have at any point in my life i believe lord that that people who accomplish that that would be the people who break out of this dimension and go into another realm that's the ones that'll do it lord i don't know what'll happen lord it i i don't have confidence i wish i did i wish i could stand here and just say oh it's okay as long as you come to this church and you believe god sent a prophet and you're a believer it's okay you don't ever really have to get sincere very dedicated you'll be fine the lord will the lord will just jerk you in anyhow i i like saying that i it gives me hope to believe none none that i that are under my care would be lost but lord i don't have the confidence in that like i like the confidence i have in tonight and what i've said that i have a great confidence i know that the people who follow these this message that i've given out here tonight these quotes that i've read and these challenges that i've made i know those are the people that will take i have a hundred percent confidence those are the people for sure who will go in the rapture and people who just won't who just don't and year after year they just allow carnality in their lives and they just oh i'll get serious with god someday and one of these days they're going to wake up and there ain't going to be another day to do that i pray tonight father that there'll be a a sincerity in our hearts lord to press press into this type of relationship that a prophet has described in these quotes where it is a it is a recreation of the early church that church was on fire lord that church was fervent that church had faith that church had zeal that church was determined to be separate from the world amen i pray you will grant that to us lord grant that to us grant to us that desire to to say lord i want to make my commitment this year at the end of this year i want to commit to you that i'm going to give my mind more to reading and hearing your word i'm going to give my heart more to fellowship and prayer i'm going to give my schedule more to being at the house of god and being among the saints and putting my shoulder to the wheel with everybody else lord and and be all for one and one for all i want i want this year lord if nobody does it but me then i want to make sure i do it but i have confidence lord that i won't be the only one i just don't believe i will be i believe there's plenty of people in here tonight and listening online who say lord oh father i'll raise up my hands and say i'm determined in this new coming year to press when i take this communion supper tonight i'm taking it with a greater purpose i'm taking it with a greater determination i'm not just completing symbolism this isn't just ritualism i lord i'm identifying myself with something so i committed to you in jesus name amen paul says here as brother luther begins to prepare the items now concerning or excuse me for i have received of the lord that which also i delivered unto you that the lord jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread and when he had given thanks he break it and said take heed this is my body which is broken for you this do in remembrance of me after the same manner also he took the cup and when he had sucked saying this cup is the new testament in my blood this do ye as oft as you drink it in remembrance of me for as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup you do show the lord's death till he come wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the lord now i love this next verse because when i i remember when i was a teenager growing up and i love the lord and i believed the message but you know i still i couldn't go in on my mom and dad's coattails i had to have my own experience with god and i and i this that that 27th verse was so foreboding to me it seemed like such a harbinger of doom every time i would read it wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the lord you can carry on sister ruth but then but then one day the lord just reminded me just read the next verse verse 28 but let a man examine himself and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup your requirement to eat this bread and drink of this cup is not that your report card has straight a's from the year past but that you're here tonight and you're willing to be examined in your heart by the presence of god you're willing to stand under the fountain of the word and wherever god has touched you and said this needs this needs improved this needs fixed this needs redone this needs repented this needs you to say amen amen amen amen lord all my life under the blood right now all my life let a man examine himself and so i just say to you speak to the lord in prayer we're going to pray one more time and you just say to the lord lord right now i've been here tonight i've heard the word of god i'm examined my life under it and the truth is when i examine my life by your word i'm a failure so i'm just going to repent and say god help me god help me how many want to how many want it to be like that say lord when i examine myself in the word i found out i'm a failure and i'm not worthy to take this so but i'm commanded to take it so here's what i'm going to do lord i'm going to plunge into the sea of god's blood i'm going to step down into the river hallelujah i'm going to let that that that blood of christ wash right over me amen and cleanse all my heart and my mind and when i step forward to this communion unworthy as i have been i'm going to stand perfectly perfectly acceptable in the presence of god let's pray once more master we thank you for these articles that are here prepared [Music] thank you for the laborers who made all of this possible bringing it all together thank you for the saints of god lord who are out here tonight to to partake of this right it is a believer's right to come to the lord's table we come humbly lord we come repenting we come asking the blood of jesus christ and all of his mercy to cover all of our lives lord when i examine myself in the word i find that i'm all together undone but lord i'm looking to that day on calvary i'm looking to an empty tomb lord i'm looking to a christ that ascended and sent back his life into the church and it fell upon me and lord i'm grateful for that now may you take every person man woman boy and girl young and old lord of every station in life may we have your mercy right now lord as we come humbly to this table we commit the articles to

gave us a uh really short timeline which is putting a smith on a short timeline is dangerous so uh i'm also kind to my sister so hopefully i can talk fast um so i'm actually gonna uh stand you all back up just for a quick minute to read the word here and um we'll turn to um psalms chapter 31 and i'm also going to start my timer so i can pull the breaks really fast um and we'll go to psalms 31 verse 30 22. um turn there myself and i had it marked excellent um psalms 31 and verse 32. for i said in my haste 22 yes i'm sorry um for i said in my haste i am cut off from before thine eyes nevertheless thou heardest my voice the voice of my supplications when i cried unto thee amen y'all can be seated um knowing that this is a new year's eve service um kind of wanted to think about the last year really two years going into 2022. um you know the last few years have been really dark and kind of psychologically depressing and it feels like there's a lot of darkness especially more than there ever seems like before and i've it seems like there's just been this wave of almost psychological manipulation um and it had my mind thinking about um certain things that i've experienced in and some of my education and and different things and um i wanted to just take a few minutes and talk about um something a phrase you some of you might have heard it have you ever heard the term gaslighting people you use it a lot in the news you get some talking head and saying oh this politician is lying he's trying to gaslight the american people well what that effectively means is it's somebody who's trying to lie to you and tell you that what you saw and what you experienced didn't actually happen and then it's all a lie it's all fake you're crazy you don't know what you're talking about and you don't believe you're lying eyes right um well this is actually a term that comes from the psychology world um it is actually a tactic that abusive people will use to keep their victims under their thumb right because if you've got some abusive relationship say um some man beating up his wife he can't just beat her up and then because she'll just leave right he has to also psychologically manipulate her keep her in the relationship so she doesn't just go away from him so um it's the idea that you're going to keep somebody psychologically manipulated that they're not going to know what's the truth they're not going to know what's real they're going to be completely confused and they're not going to trust their own judgment and have faith in their own knowledge of what's happening and you wonder how in the world did the term gaslighting get attached to that well actually comes from an old movie that was actually originally a play written back in the 1800s called the gaslights um and so i figured i would just take a little bit of time and tell you the story because i thought it was very interesting i figured if brother branham could preach on a pack of cigarettes i can preach on an old movie um so um the the story goes that there was a man who's kind of a charlatan and a con and he finds about finds out about this woman who is an heir or an heiress rather to an estate the problem is she doesn't know that she's an heir to the full extent of the state she doesn't know what she really got um she got a house and then somewhere hidden in that house that she doesn't know about is actually an old family heirloom it's a some sort of treasure of some kind and the this man realizes that she doesn't know what she's got he knows that somewhere in that house somewhere is hidden this treasure and he's got to get access to it right he wants to get access to this thing he doesn't care about her he just wants that treasure so he convinces her to marry him and the whole time they're living in this house he is trying to get this treasure right now ain't that just like the devil right he doesn't care about us he doesn't care about anything but he'll tell you all kinds of sweet nothings to get into your life to get you to go along with what his plans are because he knows that you have something that he he doesn't have and he doesn't have access to it right um i don't really have time to read it but brother branham talks about um how that uh satan wanted humanity specifically because he he couldn't reproduce himself he has no creative power humanity actually has creative power and satan doesn't have that he can't build an eden without us can't build in his eden without the cooperation of humanity so his only path to satan's eden is to is to manipulate humanity into building it for him okay so this guy um he's he also has a problem because he doesn't like this woman he doesn't actually love her and he just wants the treasure so he needs to get rid of her but he can't kill her because that's he's got another problem see there's there's a third person in this story and i'm gonna i'm gonna take a little bit of poetic license with this particular story so if you go back and watch the movie it don't it's not going to be uh exactly accurate so this third character is a is a is a policeman right and he he kind of liked this girl going way back right they kind of grew up together and they they liked each other they had a bit of a relationship right he when they were younger but as you know time went on and they kind of fell apart right and you know that's kind of how we get when we're young and we're in church and we get a little bit of a relationship with god and we maybe get baptized but then time goes on and become teenagers and the devil convinces us that we need to be in a relationship with this guy and so you end up in a relationship that you didn't really want to be in the first place with somebody who doesn't actually love you and now you're trapped and this policeman he knows what's up he knows that this girl got taken for a ride and he knows that he cares about her and he can't just go he can't just go haul her away they're married he's got to have he's got to be able to use the law to justify handling the situ the situation and he knows that if he just investigates it far enough he'll he'll solve the situation because the law will always solve it so um and he knows and so the our villain he knows he can't just kill the kill the girl because law man will get him right there's there's there's an authority that won't let him do that so what he does is he starts manipulating her he starts convincing her that everything that she knows is a lie and he does stuff like he will move her keys around or he'll move the dishes around when she wasn't looking and then she'll be like wasn't that sitting over there no honey it was always the way it is right now and she starts doubting herself she starts getting a little bit you know feeling a little bit weird about it and he starts slowly ramping it up until find like one day she goes to a friend's house and he repaints some of the walls and she goes like why is that green oh honey it was always green you know and we get you know we'll have experiences we'll have things that we know happened we we had we saw something in the word we we know where we stand and then the devil come along go oh no you're it wasn't ever that way you never got that deliverance that you thought you got right and he slowly starts ramping it up ramping it up and she starts getting a little bit she starts getting farther and farther into her own head and she starts really doubting herself and she starts not associating with people because she she feels bad she feels like she's going crazy and this guy is convincing her that she's nuts and she's nothing wrong with her she knows the truth and she's being convinced that shh everything that she knows is a lie and so she stops associating with her friends because she's she's so put off by everything she doesn't know what's what's real and what isn't you know in christians when we're going through a hard time and we don't know where we are and things get really dark and the first thing we'll do is we'll start isolating right i mean really in any abusive relationship one of the first signs is see the abused party will always start self-isolating because that abuser is trying to keep you keep the the abused away from other people who can help them right trying to trying to draw draw a line and a wall and so in this the in this story the villain he's always around her he doesn't let her be around other people without him there right it's like whenever you get around you know when you're going through a hard time and the devil's just beating you down you know you get around church people and that's when the devil is going to start attacking you in your mind right it's when you get away out away from yourself and get nice and isolated then then he'll give you some relief make you think that's what you want right make you think the solution to your psychological pain is to not be around people so he's always he's always there always always questioning her in front of other people always doing everything he can to make her feel make her doubt what she knows is the truth and so as time goes on he gets more and more grand in what he does to get her to doubt herself and at this point she's completely isolated doesn't go out anymore doesn't doesn't gather together you know with her with her people and the final thing that he does to get her to break because in the in the story it's back in the old days before they had electric lighting they had gas natural gas lamps on all the walls and he went to all the valves and he turned the gas down and it got any slowly over time until the lights got darker and darker and all the shades are pulled and she's walking around the middle of the day in almost perfect darkness and there's no lights and she's going around going man it's dark in here and he's going oh no this is how bright it's always been you've always been in darkness and that's where we end up the devil will get us so cornered and so surrounded and so convinced that the trial that we're in has always been there and that we're crazy and then we're hopeless and that there's there's no light and there never was any light and finally she just breaks down she's going through a mental breakdown and he's like oh honey we'll just take you to the mental hospital you're clearly going insane we'll take you to the mental hospital they'll be able to help you and so she goes and starts packing her bags to go check herself into the instant institution because she's a perfectly normal person who knows the truth knows that there's light outside and is so convinced that her life is nothing but darkness that she's going to go check herself into a prison cell effectively and that is what the devil will do to you he will get you to go check yourself into your own prison cell and he'll tell you that that's what you want that oh well you know this this disease that you have you know it's it's all you're going to have it's what you have you're never going to get out of it just accept what you have right or you know the psychological problem or uh this marital problem or financial whatever it is anything that the devil is going to he will convince you that what you have is not only you know correct and that you you there isn't anything outside of it but also that you kind of deserve it right so this is the little part in the movie right it's literally dark and you know we're surrounded by a lot of darkness in the world and sometimes it's going to get feel really dark in the world well this is when our hero comes in because he knows what's going on he knows this girl is isolated he knows there's something wrong and so he he decides one day he's going to go knock on the door he's going to see what's going on so he knocks on the door the policeman and she opens the door and she's packing her bags to go take herself away to the padded room and he walks in there and he's kind of talking to her is like so how's it been oh that's nice why is it so dark in here and she goes it's always been this dark it goes no it's not look and he turns the light on and then her eyes come open she's like whoa it's lighting here there's i wasn't crazy after all right the devil's gonna convince you that you're you're crazy but there's a man who can turn lights on right no matter how dark it's going to get for you there's a man who can turn on the lights no matter how dark it gets in the world no matter how dark it gets in your life no matter how convinced you are that what you have is going to be there forever it's a lie it's always been a lie it's always going to be a lie there's always light in the world and there's a man who can give it to you it's not me but it is the policeman who by the way i thought this was interesting he now has the grounds to throw out this this villain right who's a deadbeat and a bum who has no ability to contribute to this relationship other than abuse okay he can now deal with that because the woman is on his side she's accepting the deliverance that he's bringing her okay and in in our particular story not only is he the the law man he's also the one who wrote the law and the white wig judge so he's going to find this person guilty and kill him that's the poetic license um so he's going to kill this villain on the spot and that is the deliverance that the lord is offering you today i don't care how dark and this is going forward into the new year i know things are going to get dark it's prophesied that it's going to get dark it's not going to get any any better and it's only going to get worse but no matter how dark it's going to get there is somebody who has light and can deliver us and um and uh that's uh what was on my heart and i got 40 38 seconds left so and uh [Applause] god bless you i guess it's uh brother brad yes brad uh yes brother brad come my brother wow kind of reminded me his dad not 15 minutes you got that right i believe brother brown said you need to stay with your pastor i think our pastor took 35 minutes so but y'all saw he said you got to obey him too so let's all stand real quick and let's read what's on my heart joshua chapter 1 verse 9 and he says have not i commanded thee be strong and of good courage be not afraid neither be thou dismayed for the lord thy god is with thee whether soever thou goest god bless you and have your seats this is one of my favorite scriptures when there's trouble when i go worried this scripture

read out of numbers the 13th chapter tonight hey man brother we're i was just reading this morning just studying over the last few days and i just was not sure what what way to go and uh talking about joshua as well we are well able to overcome tonight friends in numbers chapter 13 we're going to go to chapter 13 and verse 26. and they went and came to moses and to aaron into all the congregation of the children of israel unto the wilderness of peron to kadesh and brought back word unto them and unto all the congregation and shoot them all the fruit of the land and they told them and he said we come out to the land whither thou sinnest and surely it floweth with milk and honey and this is the fruit of it nevertheless the people be strong that dwell on the land and the cities are walled and very great and moreover we saw the children of anac there the amalekites dwell in the land the south the hittites and the jebesites and the amorites dwell in the mountains and the canaanites dwell by the sea and by the coast of jordan and caleb stilled the people moses and let us go up and said let us go up at once for we are well able to overcome it amen friends you can have your seats tonight and caleb still the people and said at once and possess it for we are well able to overcome it you don't have to turn with me tonight but in joshua 14 verses 6 through 9 and it says the children of judah came into joshua in gilgal and this is this is after they reached the promised land friends well who's going to make it to the promised land with me amen we're going to make it amen the children of uh judah came into joshua and gilgal and caleb the son of jeffery the kazonite said unto him thou knowest the thing that the lord said unto moses the man of god concerning me and thee and kadesh barnea 40 years old when i was when moses the servant of the lord sent me from kadesh barnia to expire out the land and i brought him word as it was in my heart nevertheless my brethren that went up with that went up with me made the heart of the people melt but i wholly followed the lord my god amen i holy follow the lord my god and moses swear on that day saying surely the land wherein they step where they feed have trodden shall be thine inheritance and thy children forever and ever because thou hast holy followed the lord thy god we're fighting for our ground tonight friends we are fighting for a place that we have seen our prophet saw that land we know it we have a promise in revelation 24 21 4 it says that there's going to be a place with no more sorrow no more tears no more agony and we know for sure we have we have that we have the prophet we have that caleb and joshua saying to us hey man friends that we're going to make it amen friends we're going to make it tonight we're going to make it it doesn't matter if it's next week next month we're going to go into this year i just wanted to talk a little bit about this past year and what it what it was for us what it meant to us the testimony service that we had where you know those brothers got up and and they testified of the things that they that they were going through and and that they they brought through and brother jack and brother jason and and brother mark and it just it really touched my heart to be in that service and of all the things that the lord did for us this year brother jason was talking a little bit about it and you know i was just studying this sermon i was just studying for it and brother steve short texted me just out of nowhere and it was a video that i hadn't seen actually i've never seen the video but i but i lived it i lived the video it was it was my baptism and i looked back on that moment and it was just a few minutes and it was a long time ago but it meant it meant the world to me that he sent me that this week because i was just studying this and when we when we took that promise when god called our hearts he had us he had a he had something in mind he had something in mind for us and now we're at we're at the culmination of it we're at the end of it friends we are gonna make it i am here to say as caleb caleb said in chapter 13 i am say i'm here to steal you and before moses and say let us go up at once and possess it for we are well able to overcome it friends we are well able to overcome it brother branham says in and god keeps his word it says the lord thy god is with thee wherever thou goest no matter what it is how hard it is how great the obstacle is that doesn't matter if it's down through the valley of the shadow of death the lord thy god is with thee wherever thou goest how joshua could call israel together and say stand here and watch the glory of the lord god is with us god made that promise amen friends god said to joshua every place that the souls of your feet set that's yours i'll give it to you that's yours friends he said that he gave it to us they were those were two men if you go back and listen to this week you should go back and listen to one in a million friends they were one in a million because they were the two that made it to the promised land they were given eyes that could see that land they knew god had promised them that land they knew that whatever the giants if you go back and read that story the the other the other messengers said that they were that they were giants that they they couldn't overcome but joshua and caleb said to them no friends we have a promise from the almighty god that we can overcome that land we can possess it and we are at that time now friends i'm telling you we're at that time in one in a million there i have it right here the quote when israel and egypt there was approximately two million people left at the same time everyone heard the message of the prophet everyone saw everyone saw the pillar of fire every one of them was baptized to moses in the red sea amen every single one of them shouted in the spirit they beat the tambourines they run up and down the bank with me with miriam when moses sang in the spirit every one of them drank from the same spiritual rock they everyone ate fresh manna every night every one of them two but two out of a million made the land that's one in a million two two million and two of them made it that's one in a million what was the test they all drank the same rock they all like the same manna that we're eating this morning but the word test proved it when it came to the time of kadesh barnia when they were to go into the promised land they could not go over till it was tested by the word friends this this is tested by the word this message that we're living in now has been tested by the word and it's been proved it's been proved over and over again and i'm living it today i can say with all my heart i'm living it today have i fallen have each one of us fallen since especially each one of us has fallen we've come short paul would say oh wretched man that i am i am i am the greatest sinner among all of us but but i am here by the glory of god to encourage you to stand and to go into the promised land in this in this new year it says um we can make it we're like grasshoppers to them they're great walled city the opposition was too great but caleb and joshua stilled the people they said we're more than able to do it amen why because god said it before they left the promised land he said that i'm gonna give you the land i'm gonna give it and it will be yours and they were one out of a million amen friends amen friends we're gonna turn to um to joshua real quick just ending ending chapter joshua 14 verses 6 through 9 and it says then the children of judah came up unto joshua into gilgal and caleb the set the son of jeffernua the kazai said unto them thou knowest the thing that the lord said unto moses the man of god concerning me and thee in gadesh barnea forty years old was i when the servant when moses was a servant of the lord sent to me to kadesh barnea to spy out the land and i brought him word as it was in my heart nevertheless amen friends nevertheless can we say nevertheless my brethren that went with me made the heart of the people melt but i followed the lord i want to i want to be able to say that on that day oh well done my good and faithful servant because i follow the lord and moses sweared on that day and surely the land where thou on hath trodden shall be thine inheritance and thy children forever because thou hast fully followed the lord and this new year friends let's just fully follow the lord and we'll take stride amen praise the lord [Applause] god bless you all usually takes me about 15 minutes just to get started so we're going to do better here amen i want to speak about thought distortions so you got it up for me we're coming into the new year and you start to think about plans and and making plans and wanting to improve yourself coming into the new year we think of things like renewing our purpose making new goals spending more time in devotions losing weight etc etc etc all right what is brother brent let's see what brother branham talks about with new year's resolutions he says some people say well you should live a better life turn a new page this is new year's oh how many resolutions did you make and all of you broke them it'll never work it's dying out and a rebirth a regeneration a new creature in christ jesus that's what the world needs today that's what the church needs today is an old time apostolic god shaken holy ghost revival that's right i don't mean a bunch of fanaticism i don't believe in a bunch of emotional worked up but i mean a real true blood-borne salvation that sets men free from sin and makes him a new creature in christ that's what we need that's what we need but we want we want to we want to grow right that's the we make a new year's resolution we want to grow we want to improve ourselves right but you're not going to improve yourself just by writing something you want to do on a piece of paper or deciding to do something in your mind just like brother branham said that's that none of you have kept them none of you followed through sometimes you make it through january most the time you don't even make it that far romans 12 1-2 i beseech you therefore brethren by the mercies of god let this be our new year's resolution that you present your bodies as a living sacrifice holy acceptable unto god which is your reasonable service and be not conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of god proverbs 23 verse 7 for as he thinks thinketh in his heart so is he we hear that quoted often but we don't look at this next part eden drinks saith he to thee but his heart is not with thee in other words he says one thing but his thoughts are different than what he says his thoughts line up with his actions but his words are a lie so don't let your new new year's resolution prove that you're a liar don't let it do that go deeper understand when you're making and if you're making a new year's resolution i don't like to do that i like to live just a consistent life but let's put it this way many times you come to the end of the year thanksgiving rolls around the years coming to end and you say you start to examine yourself that's good we should do that every month we do that every week every day a few times a day continually but as you think in your heart so are you so understand if you want something to change in your life you have to first change your thinking and what do we want to do as christians we want to think think as the word has us think not our own way not the way culture tells us not the way people tell us around us not the way our parents raised us god bless them whatever they did they're not the word of god they're not the absolute we want to think god's ways all of us have right now inside of our mind thought distortions we think about ourselves contrary to the word of god and we just continue to do that in emotional weight in things about emotions and things about mentally physically spiritually all these different things we think about ourselves our lives our purpose incorrectly and we communicate back to ourselves incorrectly again again brother bam says we have no thought coming what does that mean it means that we are to think as the bible speaks we're to think biblical thoughts message thoughts truth let let our thought life shape our actions so what are thought distortions habitual ways of thinking that are often inaccurate and negatively biased we have to make no effort to think the way we think we just that's how we think but we need to examine ourselves and we need to be careful because the way you think is going to shape your actions simply put anything contrary to biblical truth is a thought distortion if it's not according to the bible throw it in the trash can and reshape your way of thinking i i couldn't stand here and tell you i could go down a list of types of thought distortions and i have a list of types of thought distortions i'll probably skip right past it but all of us have to go before the lord and let the holy spirit search us to where we think we're thinking incorrectly and it's producing the wrong kind of life that we have in us and around us the wrong atmosphere the wrong attitude and the wrong decisions so what's wrong with just thought distortions you deceive yourself self with the words that you speak to yourself in your mind but also your thoughts then produce the actions wrong thinking produces wrong actions which then produces wrong consequences in your life a natural example something stressful happens i'm probably guilty something stressful happens in your life and you habitually respond it doesn't take any thought it just naturally happens you go and start eating to calm down your stress is that supposed is is that what that's for is that what food is for is that what god wants us to do are we turning to the right thing that can help us what's the consequence stress is momentarily relieved but ends in increased stress and being overweight and unhealthy so renewed thinking says stressful event happens i need to respond the way the bible wants me to respond go to prayer and to reading the bible for your comfort that's true worship of god i'm in trouble let's go eat what's your worshiping your god is your belly you're worshiping food don't turn to that for comfort we turn to the lord for comfort and then what's the consequence of doing that god is working i'm receiving peace and stress is relieved source of thought distortions it's satan seeking to destroy mankind through deceit and doubt and to use that deceit and doubt to perpetuate deceit and doubt throughout the world it's a man-centered means of immediate survival but long-term destruction types of thought distortion polarized thinking everything's black and white either a person's an angel or a devil today they're an angel and then they do me wrong now they're devil over generalization you take you take one quickly you you experience one event in your life and then all other events that happen in the future are exactly like that event that happened before no they're not it's not how it works catastrophizing every ordinary worries and difficulties you figure out what the worst thing that could possibly happen and then you fixate that the catastrophe is coming everybody personalization you take things personally when it has nothing to do with you assuming you could be assuming you're purposely left out of something or assuming that someone speaking is oh that they were they they were speaking that against me you don't know that ask them you think that you know that but you don't know that mind reading that's when we assume we know what other people are thinking without considering all the evidence or even asking the person what what the case is what the situation is mental filtering ignoring anything positive in a situation and focusing completely on the negative interpret everything through a negative mental filter this leads to anxiety leads to depression suicidal thoughts holding on to guilt if you confess your sin to the lord ask for forgiveness made things right you don't need to hold on to the guilt anymore that's the devil distorting your mind saying i'm guilty i'm terrible i'm bad the thing's already been paid for stop thinking that way and think what god said if i confess my sins he's faithful and just to forgive my sins and cleanse me from all unrighteousness let's go let's move forward the past is the past i'm going i'm going forward with god emotional reasoning the thing that i feel is my absolute the thing that i feel the emotion that i feel is the truth okay you feel what you feel acknowledge it talk to somebody about it it's fine but don't judge what's really happening in the world based upon your emotions your emotions are not the truth the truth is the truth um labeling i'm a drunk i'm a failure i'm fat i'm ugly it's my stress i'm an anxious person it's my cancer etc etc you're not your failure and you're not your current situation you are you you're who god said you are you're defined by god you're not allowed to define yourself sorry you can do it if you want to but you're only hurting yourself listen to what god says about you you're fearfully and wonderfully made you're made in his image and likeness you're a son and daughter of god you couldn't possibly be anything better in the whole universe than that so stop thinking those other thoughts so they're not of god all right first corinthians 2 16. for who hath known the mind of the lord that he may instruct him but we have the mind of christ it is god's purpose for us to have the mind of christ not just about spiritual things but in every aspect of our life because the reality is the things that happen in this physical body impact your spiritual life the things that happen in your spirit your mind those five senses of your mind that impacts your spiritual life the the things that happen in your soul obviously impacts your spirit all of it does we want to have the mind of christ in each and everything amen we have to allow god into our thought life to change the way we habitually think probably the most blinded all of us are is in this area we think the way we think and it's perfectly logical it might not be it might not be it check it by the word are my is the way i'm thinking according to the word it's really easy to get caught up in the way you think and you get in this circle people that get caught in these things they're not healthy they're not spiritually healthy they're harming themselves and they're missing out on the good things that are all around them no not everything is black and white no not everything brother jason does is perfect or i do or the musician does name somebody that's even a professional musician who's perfect everything that they play they're not none of you are perfect none of you are either angels or demons your sons and daughters of god you make mistakes i make mistakes but we keep going forward we keep pressing forward and we submit our thoughts to god second corinthians 10 5 casting down imaginations and every high thing that exalts itself against the knowledge of god and bringing into captivity every thought every thought to the obedience of christ you want to have the mind of christ let's bring into captivity every thought to the obedience of christ well while amy sent me a little something about having just a few minutes to live brother jason you're saying well if there's just 30 minutes to live we have a pattern jesus christ what did jesus do with his last minutes of freedom his last time of freedom he washed feet he washed his disciples feet and he went and he prayed that's the that's these are that's just an example a small example we need to have the mind of christ in everything not just in spiritual things or church stuff everything last thing from the pergament church age in the church ages book brother branham says here's the secret of this the word is in the bride as it was in mary the bride has the mind of christ for she know what knows what he wants done with the word she performs the command of the word in his name for she has thus saith the lord then the word is quickened by the spirit and it comes to pass like a seed that is planted and watered it comes to full harvest serving its purpose that's the mind that we need to have that covers everything we've got to get we've got to allow the lord to purge us of our distorted and habitual way that we think so that the word is the only thing that's there amen god bless you [Applause] brother matthew was supposed to uh be taking this portion but uh his flight trying he's been trying to get home all day from just from atlanta i guess storms kept him out at the very last uh he kept saying okay i'm trying to get there i'll try to get there they finally canceled his flight so he is one exhausted young man and

the end and supper being ended the devil having now put into the heart of judas iscariot simon's son to betray him jesus knowing that the father had given all things into his hands and that he was come from god and went to god he riseth from supper and laid aside his garments and took a towel and girded himself after that he poureth water into a basin and began to wash the disciples feet and to wipe them with the towel wherewith he was girded then cometh he to simon peter and peter sayeth unto him lord does thou wash my feet jesus answered and said unto him what i do thou knowest not now but thou shalt know hereafter peter saith unto him thou shalt never wash my feet jesus answered him if i wash thee not thou hast no part with me simon peter saith unto him lord not my feet only but also my hands and my head jesus saith to him he that is washed needeth not save to wash his feet but is clean every wit and year clean but not all for he knew who should betray him therefore said he ye are not all clean so after he had washed their feet and had taken his garments and was set down again he said unto them know ye what i have done to you you call me master and lord and you say well for so i am if i then your lord and master have washed your feet ye also ought to wash one another's feet for i have given you an example that ye should do as i have done unto you verily verily i say unto
