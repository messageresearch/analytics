TRANSCRIPT
========================================
now is when the true worshipers shall worship the father in spirit and in truth for the father seeketh such to worship him in the days of Jesus of Nazareth when he was here owner walking in flesh he found the people in his day seeking a religion that would bring them delivery's they wanted a religion that would deliver them from all their evils and their enemies and Christianity met every challenge that they asked for Christianity met everything that they needed and everything that they asked for it challenged every one of their needs one by one they would not receive it and it's about the same as it is today we let's pray let's stand up and pray actually gracious father we come to you now Lord and we ask that your Holy Spirit would move amongst us today father that you would speak to our hearts and deal with us Lord let the word penetrate deep within us and produce the results Lord that you've sent it for father we thank you for that we ask that your name would be lifted up and glorified amongst us we ask it in Jesus name Amen god bless you you can be seated I'm gonna continue on part three of obedience is better than sacrifice as you can see on the screen kind of this is the item where we're going today faith innately grows works love innately grows obedience a perfect bride innately grows a perfected bride amen God is working mightily in this day to accomplish that in the earth amen there's a poem that my father-in-law brother Don Hoffman from back to my pastor back in when I was back in Minnesota would read often and I feel like it's very fitting for the subject we're talking about and kind of the direction I'm wanting to go today and further down the road it's by it's called the shaping of a disciple by owed it by Dale Martin stone when God wants to drill a man and thrill a man and skill a man when God wants to mold a man to play the noblest part when he yearns with all his heart to build so great and bold a man that all the world shall be amazed then watch God's methods watch his ways how ruthlessly he perfects whom he royally elects how he hammers and hurts him and with mighty blows converts him making shapes and forms which only God Himself can understand even while his man is crying lifting abbacy Ching hand yet God bends but never breaks when man's good he undertakes when he uses whom he chooses and with every purpose fuses man to act an act to man as it was when he began when God tries his splendour out man will know what he's about that's beautiful you know that's that's God's dealings with us he has promised that he's going to have a perfect bride and we have faith in that word and so that process is going to begin by our faith in that word he says you're perfect and then he says but you need to be perfected and say okay well what does that even mean you're perfect in God's eyes the blood renders us perfect and then when that blood is applied you know in a true work of justification bride justification the next result is God B starts working has to that's that's how the new birth works if there's not that working that that ruthlessly perfecting whom he royally elects you know God gets us in his hand and he he hammers us and you say well he hurts us that's what the poem said he's trying he's trying to reflect his image through us and so he has to beat out the dross you it needs to be twenty-four karat gold is he's not looking for 18 karat twelve eight that's that's too impure he wants 24 karat and then next is suffering his trials he hammers us he pounds away at us so that we are perfected in his eyes Hebrews 10 verse 14 this is from the ESV version the one we have up there because I want to bring out something in the lattice Peschel II in the last part but it's a perfect expression of what we're just talking about for by a single offering he has perfected for all time those who are being sanctified so we have both sides there he's perfected us by the blood we're in in God's sight we are perfect in other words the judge has made his judgment we're already judged in Christ you've passed from death to life but that's not it when you've passed from death to life we see there's a result which is being sanctified now that we're not talking about foolish virgin can be justified without being sanctified you can be sanctified without we're not talking about that we're talking about the bride and that's that's something different we can go through the processes but the result of justification is what sanctification and baptism and the Holy Ghost we have the Holy Ghost inside and now all work begins perfectly expressing brother branham's message look at verses 15 16 and 17 there as well where of the Holy Ghost also is a witness to us for after that he had said before this is the Covenant that I will make with them after those days saith the Lord I will put my laws into their hearts and in their minds while I write them in their sins and iniquities will I remember no more so we again see both sides God looks at us and says I don't even remember your sins you're perfect you're sinless your spotless your the virtuous Bride of Christ and he also says that he's writing his law his word in our hearts so those who have this judicial decision put upon them by the blood of Christ that they're sinless in God's eyes the result is by the Holy Ghost he writes his word within us what is the message doing in this day it declares us perfect doesn't it but then it says well you've got a process to go through you're not you're not there yet you need your do you have growing to do I need to write this word that's been delivered that you believe in and that through that you're saved but I need to write it needs to be written on your heart so that you reflect me so that no man teaches his neighbor nobody says brother Charlie you got to be obedient and well that's what we're preaching on you got to be obedient but the reality is the Holy Ghost is already writing that on your heart already convicting you and the preaching of the word just increases increases that whole project because it's the washing of water by the word the Holy Ghost in you feeding on the word transforming you to make you the image of Jesus Christ a few quotes here from things that are to be I like to call it rapture part two it's a perfect place calling you to that perfection and you have to be perfect to get there the Bible said so jesus said be therefore perfect even as your father in heaven is perfect it's a perfect Kingdom so it must be a perfect people come because you have to stand and be married to a perfect son of God and you must be a perfect bride so how can you do it any through anything else but the perfect Word of God which is the waters of separation that washes us from our sins amen that's right the blood of Jesus Christ think of it the dripping bloody word amen the blood the Word of God bleed blood to wash the bride in a man yes sir she stands perfect virgin unadulterated she never sinned in the first place amen she was trapped into it see so there's again both sides of the coin right and right in the same one we believe it he's declared as perfect and yet there's a work to do we need to be perfected from the sermon perfect faith not a faith but a perfect faith build it up in here and watch a perfect God with a perfect heart keep a perfect promise by His perfect word which is sharper than a two-edged sword and indiscernible of the heart what we're coming now to the perfection because the people has to come to this in order for the rapture that's what's holding it away right now is waiting for that church to come into that perfect raptured faith hmm looking for it it means a lot of shaving down for me it means a lot for you but together we'll make it by the grace of God amen so part of this process of rapturing faith is shaving down it's a cleansing you know brother Jason has expressed it wonderfully God had a purpose in the first age and that was to have a perfect bride with a rapturing faith but they fell away when the time came they fell away now it has to be restored this was God's intention all along when he brought the new covenant what was his intention to declare us perfect yes through the blood of Jesus Christ and to write the word on our hearts so that all we are is the word all that's made visible is the word and when that comes to place we go up and so why are we here today well what did brother Branham say that's what's holding it away right now holding Waterway the rapture that's what's holding it away right now is waiting for the church to come into that perfect raptured faith so in order to get there what does he say it means a lot of shaving down whoo lord help us that's what we want we want shaving down we want to be in that place where we can have a perfect raptured faith strange way to say it not a rapture ring a finished a perfect raptured faith and so what is it growing to that if you're not growing into that Oh check your birth you got to get the Holy Ghost because when you have the Holy Ghost in this age its leading you in this process to what perfect raptured faith and in the meantime your shape its but you're being shaved down God is correcting you God is rusyn ruthlessly perfecting whom he royally elects Philippians 2 12 and 13 I don't know if any of you have heard of the Wiest translation but it's a Greek New Testament expanded translation and sometimes it's not the greatest but sometimes it really does a tremendous job of illustrating to me the message of the hour so this is Philippians 2 12 and 13 wherefore my beloved ones as you always obeyed not as in my presence only but now much more in my absence isn't that wonderful that the Apostle saying you you're oh but you obeyed when I was there but I know you're obeying even more now that I'm gone why because it's the Holy Ghost working in you perfecting you changing you transforming you but now much more in my absence carry to its ultimate conclusion your own salvation with the wholesome serious caution and trembling now it says in the King James Version it says work out your salvation with fear and trembling that word work out is speaking like of a math problem so when you're working out a math problem there's a conclusion that it's coming to but there's a process of getting there so we we look at and say work out your salvation me oh man I got to work hard and I've got to do this and this and this and this in order to reach salvation it's not what it's saying saying carry your salvation to its ultimate conclusion as a math problem you're saved but there's a process that you go through to get to that end salvation and you won't get there unless you go through the process you can't say well I'm saved and that's the end of it I'm done that's what the whole denominational world is saying and they're missing the whole reality of the simple scripture if you're ultimately saved it means you're going through a process that God is shaving you down he's working he's care you you are a participant in it because Paul says that we must carry it to its ultimate conclusion so does that mean now that we're you know we're the ones that bring our salvation no let's keep looking and it says do it with fear and trembling in the KJV but here he's saying serious caution and trembling so that that's really tremendous when you think about how do we live our lives how do we walk with God there should be some serious caution and trembling along with it we don't just go along say hey everything's fine and no problem and hey I'm a Christian I all is just joy and happiness there's joy and happiness by all means I think that's what God ultimately made it for but within that to have joy in God an ultimate pleasure in God there needs to be some serious caution and trembling why because we know ourselves we know our weaknesses we know the points that we fail yes we still fail yes we still sin and it should cause serious caution and trembling why for or because God is the one who is constantly putting forth his energy in you I love that God is constantly putting not just sometimes not just at church not on Wednesday night God this is for the elect no God is constantly putting forth his energy his power his glory his life in you now what was what are we talking about were carrying our salvation to its ultimate conclusion why do we do it because God is putting his energy in you to do what both in the form of you being desirous of Wow and of your doing his good pleasure so how has God's energy expressed in you your desire your desire to carry your salvation to its ultimate conclusion and doing his good pleasure so that's it we're carrying our salvation to its ultimate conclusion because God is constantly putting his energy into us isn't that beautiful it's not you working yourself into salvation it's you being studious of your life studious of your choices praying feeding on the word being sure that you're in the faith being sure that you're standing right being sure that you're following in obedience to the word step-by-step why do you do that though why do you have that desire in yourself because God's constantly putting his energy in you if God isn't know let's go to the negative if God isn't putting his energy in you then what you won't work out your salvation with fear and you won't carry your salvation to its ultimate conclusion because God is hidden you the Spirit of God is in you you are carrying your salvation out to its ultimate conclusion John 8:31 and 32 then said Jesus to those Jews which believed on him if if that means that there's two sides to this if you do this this results if you don't do this this results so there's an if if you continue in my word then are you my disciples indeed and you shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free so a condition of being a disciple of Jesus is continuing in the word what if you just say I believe and that's the end of it and there's no work in your life there's no fruit there's no conformity to the word you're not continuing in the word and you're not the disciple of Jesus but when you continue in the word it's not just attending church and saying you're a message believer but it's it's abiding in staying and living in the word then you're the disciple of Jesus so we need to continue in the word if we don't jesus has tough words for us you're not my disciple we want to continue in that word Martin Luther says this thus it is just as impossible to separate faith and works as it is to separate heat and light from fire they want the one results from the other always comes forth this is from works as faith expressed trying to get this from multiple angles so you can see the reality of it notice Jesus said only believe for all things are possible to them that believe faith and works are husband and wife they work together the husband works with the wife the wife works with the husband they identify one another like a man says he's married and yet he can't produce and show that he has a wife you doubt his claim see a man said I'm married where's your wife oh I don't know about that see see be kind of hard thing for me to believe in I say well where is your wife well I don't know I'm going to believe it so you see if you have what you say you have I have faith how are you gonna show me you got faith by your work see I'm married how do you know you're married this is my wife see there you are so you know it's it's totally connected to each other faith is what saves us the Holy Ghost baptism within us is what brings the life but it produces something faith being alone without works it's dead it's it's dead faith it's not genuine faith because the devil's believe also and tremble true and genuine faith always results in works now when we hear faith and works you know we go back to some traditional way of thinking and think what works is you know giving to the poor and doing this that's part of it absolutely in other words I all go up to it this way Paul talks about the fruit of the Spirit so you have the spirit in your life you say I've received the Holy Ghost now something results in that there's a fruit there's a result there's something there's a bearing there's a bearing of wheat and see and so forth when you have the Holy Ghost when you have a life inside of you there's something that's produced as a result and so if there's not something that's produced there's something out of order and we got to get it right Romans 6:17 and I'll quickly close with this much more to cover but do that next time but God be thanked that you were the servants of sin but you hope have obeyed from the heart that form of doctrine which was delivered you obeyed is a very interesting word in the Greek it's the word means to hear under as a subordinate that is to listen attentively by implication to heed or conformed to a command or authority remember brother Branham talks about he that Jesus said he that hears my word and believes on him that sent me has eternal life and his past as far as passed from death to life he says any drunkard can hear the word any prostrate prostitute can hear the word it's not just that the word the word hearing in the Greek speaks of hearing in hearing under so what does that mean think about it for a second tissue it's to listen and then to come in submission to the word that's being smoke spoken so they've obeyed from the heart they heard and come under that word from the heart they've the Paul says the form of doctor in the form of teaching which was delivered to you another translation says which you were delivered unto in other words God has delivered you to this message not that it was delivered to you God delivered you into the message and we listened and came in submission to it that's what Ablett message believer does they don't just say I believe and then live any kind of life live as close to the line as possible they they say look I've heard this word my desire is to submit and come under its authority so that it can produce the life that it's supposed to produce oh my god so much more here but I better quit let's pray gracious father we love you and we're grateful Lord to see the purpose of this message to produce a perfect bride that is in the process of being perfected for that raptured faith Lord let us come under it Lord let us hear and submit ourselves fully and completely to it father we love you we're so grateful for your work and we say Lord will you continually put your energy into us father we need more of that more of your energy so that we can carry our salvation out to its ultimate conclusion we ask it in the name of Jesus Christ amen [Music]
