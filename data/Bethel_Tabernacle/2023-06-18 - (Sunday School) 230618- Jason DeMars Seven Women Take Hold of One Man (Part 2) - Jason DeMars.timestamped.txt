[0:00] Heavenly Father, we just come before you
[0:01] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[0:03] And we want to commit this day to you.
[0:06] We want to commit ourselves to you,
[0:07] Lord. We ask your Holy Spirit would come
[0:09] and open your word and teach us this
[0:11] morning. We pray, Lord, that you'd help
[0:13] each one of us to lay aside the the the
[0:18] worries of this life and the cares of
[0:20] this life, Lord, that we would just turn
[0:23] our focus and turn our hearts to you,
[0:25] Lord. That you would speak to us and
[0:26] deal with us, Lord. Help us to uh
[0:28] glorify your name today. We ask in Jesus
[0:30] name. Amen. And God bless you. We can
[0:34] going to open in the scriptures to
[0:36] Isaiah 4 and we're going to read one and
[0:42] two
[0:45] and we're going to continue on our
[0:47] topic. There it is.
[0:56] It was left on. So, I'm going to hope it
[0:58] works. It does. Good deal. All right. In
[1:01] that day, seven women shall take hold of
[1:03] one man, saying, "We will eat our own
[1:05] bread and wear our own apparel. Only let
[1:08] us be called by thy name to take away
[1:10] our reproach. In that day shall the
[1:12] branch of the Lord be beautiful and
[1:14] glorious, and the fruit of the earth
[1:16] shall be excellent and comely for them
[1:18] that are escaped of Israel." May the
[1:20] Lord add the blessing to the reading of
[1:21] his word. You can be seated.
[1:24] So part two on seven women shall take
[1:27] hold of one man. And if you look at this
[1:30] word there it says take hold means to
[1:33] seize to grab hold tightly to refrain or
[1:37] support by grabbing hold of. And so when
[1:41] you think about this this word this
[1:44] verse is we're you know you can you can
[1:47] you could say there's a natural
[1:49] fulfillment of scripture and there's a
[1:51] spiritual or typological filment
[1:53] fulfillment of scripture. And so you
[1:55] know some of the commentators point to
[1:58] you know the time that Titus sacked
[2:00] Jerusalem and killed so many uh men and
[2:04] there was very few uh men left and there
[2:08] was only only women. And so they had a
[2:11] very difficult time finding a husband
[2:13] and they'll say they're saying we'll
[2:14] just we don't care about what God's
[2:17] requirements are. We'll just do it our
[2:19] way and but let give us your name and
[2:23] and and and be your be our protection
[2:27] because you're giving us your name. And
[2:29] so that that's the natural fulfillment.
[2:31] Even in the natural fulfillment, you can
[2:33] carry it forward to today where we have
[2:36] such an hour where uh feminism has come
[2:40] to its full circle. And when I say
[2:43] feminism has come to its full circle, I
[2:44] mean now they've shot themselves in
[2:47] their own foot
[2:48] by the madness of justice and equity
[2:54] coming to this place where now we don't
[2:57] even know what a woman is.
[2:59] Right? You you try to you try to ask an
[3:02] educated person today or a politician,
[3:05] what is a woman? Boy, you're going to
[3:07] fry their brain.
[3:09] How should I answer that? Well, a woman
[3:10] who is someone who identifies as a
[3:13] woman. Well, what is that?
[3:15] We don't know what that is. So, that's
[3:19] that's the full circle
[3:22] feminism. Are you happy? Are you glad
[3:25] here? Are you glad that your sports are
[3:27] just going to be destroyed with all
[3:29] kinds of terrible athletic unathletic
[3:31] men destroying you now because men are
[3:35] designed stronger?
[3:37] Wow. We found out really that men and
[3:40] women are different and God made them
[3:43] differently. They're designed at the
[3:45] very cellular level differently. What a
[3:48] shocker. No, it's not a shocker.
[3:51] No, it's exactly what God's word says.
[3:55] And you say these things and people are
[3:57] offended. They're they're upset. You
[4:00] know, who knows? The YouTube channel
[4:02] might get cancelled for Bethl
[4:04] Tabernacle. Now,
[4:06] you know, these things are happening.
[4:09] And that's that's the hour we're living
[4:12] in. Seven women shall take hold of one
[4:14] man, saying, "We will eat our own bread
[4:16] and wear our own apparel." The scripture
[4:18] in Exodus 21:10, this of course is
[4:21] speaking about if if if there's a
[4:24] polygamous relationship, if if the
[4:26] husband takes another wife, says if you
[4:29] take him another wife, her food, her
[4:30] raignment, and her duty of marriage
[4:32] shall he not diminish? But of course,
[4:34] I'm just looking at it in the sense of a
[4:36] husband's duty
[4:38] is to provide food, clothing, uh
[4:42] housing, etc. for his wife. That's his
[4:46] duty. That's that's her expectation of
[4:48] him, right? And so it God is commanding
[4:52] men if you're going to of course this is
[4:55] Old Testament is not allowed now. He's
[4:57] commanding men if you take another wife
[5:00] don't you're not going to diminish
[5:02] your provision. You have to provide your
[5:06] duty what you're supposed to do for her.
[5:09] And she is by God's word is to expect
[5:11] this. Right? So then we have the
[5:14] reverse. We see here is now it's
[5:16] reversed bread and clothes. She's going
[5:19] to say, "I'm going to provide it. I I'm
[5:22] going to supply this.
[5:24] I'm going to have a I'm going to get a
[5:26] degree and I'm going to have a career
[5:29] and you man, I don't need you.
[5:32] Just let me be married and take away the
[5:34] approach." So then we then we forward
[5:36] this to the spiritual application.
[5:42] I lost control here.
[5:45] All right, we take it then to the
[5:47] spiritual application.
[5:50] Revelation 18:7,
[5:53] speaking of
[5:55] mystery Babylon,
[5:58] how much she hath glorified herself and
[6:00] lived deliciously. So much torment and
[6:02] sorrow give her. For she saith in her
[6:04] heart, I sit a queen and am no widow,
[6:07] and shall see no sorrow.
[6:09] Right. So there there she is exalting
[6:11] herself, exalting her place, exalting
[6:13] her position. I'm the one in control.
[6:15] Remember we read last week Revelation
[6:17] 17. It's the riding upon the
[6:19] beast. So it's a woman controlling the
[6:22] governmental system which we know
[6:24] represents the Roman Catholic Church and
[6:26] the denominational systems. They're they
[6:29] have committed adultery against Jesus
[6:31] Christ and made their another Jesus,
[6:34] another gospel, and another spirit. and
[6:36] they've turned against him. Instead of
[6:38] receiving the vindicated truth of the
[6:40] Bible, they've taken their own
[6:42] interpretation, which is the
[6:43] interpretation of men, which is saying,
[6:46] "I'll I'll have my own bread. I'll
[6:48] supply my own bread. I don't need the
[6:50] bread that Christ sends and Christ
[6:52] vindicates. I I want the bread that I
[6:55] can supply." You see how it's flipped
[6:58] flipped on its head? Now, a woman is
[7:00] taking hold of Christ. Seven women,
[7:03] seven churches, seven denominations.
[7:06] It means seven in in in Jewish means the
[7:09] completion, right? In the Jewish
[7:11] scriptures. So it's the completion. The
[7:14] church as a whole besides a small
[7:16] remnant has said we'll take hold of this
[7:20] man Christ. We don't want your bread and
[7:23] we don't want the raignment that you
[7:25] prov.
[7:30] But it's a perverted word. It can't
[7:31] produce life. It only It's hybrid. It
[7:34] produces death. She says, "I'm a queen.
[7:37] Look at me." What is What is uh the
[7:40] Catholic Church call itself? Queen.
[7:42] Queen of heaven. What does it call Mary?
[7:44] The queen of heaven.
[7:48] Revelations 3:17. Because thou sayest, I
[7:51] am rich and increased with goods, and
[7:53] have need of nothing, and knowest not
[7:55] that thou art wretched, and miserable,
[7:57] and poor, and blind, and naked. That's
[7:59] the condition of seven women taking hold
[8:01] of one man saying I'll I'll eat my own
[8:04] bread and provide my own clothing. This
[8:08] is this is the this is the result is
[8:10] saying I don't need anything. I don't
[8:11] need the vindicated word. I don't I
[8:13] don't need the truth that Christ sends.
[8:16] I've got my own version. I've got my own
[8:18] interpretation. Well, the Bible says
[8:21] that the word is not of any private
[8:23] interpretation. But God interprets his
[8:25] own word by sending a prophet and
[8:27] bringing it to pass.
[8:30] Revelation 3:20, "Behold, I stand at the
[8:32] door and knock. If any man hear my voice
[8:35] and open the door, I will come into him
[8:37] and will s with him and he with me."
[8:40] This this is a verse that the
[8:42] denominational systems have turned into
[8:44] just ah this is a lovely invitational
[8:46] verse. Come to the altar and shake the
[8:49] minister's hand and ask Jesus into your
[8:52] heart.
[8:55] That's not what this is talking about.
[8:56] This is a prophetic scripture saying
[8:59] Christ is on the outside of the church
[9:02] and he's been he's been cast out.
[9:05] He said we we we'll we'll eat our own
[9:08] bread. We'll wear our own reignment.
[9:11] Let only let us be called by your name
[9:14] to take away our reproach. We want to be
[9:16] called by the name of Christian, but we
[9:18] don't want to take Christ what Christ
[9:21] has delivered to us in this day.
[9:24] So he's standing outside and he's
[9:26] knocking. The rejected king, the
[9:28] rejected
[9:30] bridegroom. She says, "I have my own
[9:32] husbands. I have my I have my own bread.
[9:35] I have my own food. I've got my own
[9:38] career. I don't need you to provide for
[9:40] me. I don't need you to take care of me.
[9:43] I don't need a husband. I just want your
[9:45] name. Okay? I just I just I just want to
[9:49] have some sort of relationship that
[9:52] satisfies me. But I don't want the bread
[9:56] of life that Christ has offered. I have
[9:59] what I want. I have what suits me, what
[10:02] suits me in a modern world.
[10:05] Revelation 17:4-5.
[10:09] And the woman was arrayed in purple and
[10:11] scarlet color and decked with gold and
[10:13] precious stones and pearls, having a
[10:14] golden cup in her hand, full of
[10:16] abominations and filthiness of her
[10:18] fornication. And upon her forehead was a
[10:20] name written, "Mistry Babylon the great,
[10:23] the mother of harlots and abominations
[10:25] of the earth." We spoke about this last
[10:27] time and gave the details behind it. I
[10:30] won't do that again, but I'm just going
[10:31] to point out she's arrayed. She's
[10:34] dressed in purple and scarlet. This is
[10:36] her own garment that she's provided by
[10:39] her own works. And what was her own
[10:41] works? It was persecution
[10:44] of anyone that didn't dis didn't take
[10:47] sides with her. If you didn't confess
[10:50] the Catholic faith, you were martyed. 68
[10:53] million people during the dark ages were
[10:57] put to death by the Roman Catholic
[10:59] Church. And what is it? She what is
[11:01] what's the substance that she has in her
[11:04] golden cup? It's blood from the martyrs
[11:07] of Jesus. She's drinking the blood of
[11:10] the mart. She's not she's not drinking
[11:12] the wine that brings a stimulation of
[11:15] revelation. She's drinking her own
[11:17] works, the result of her own works, the
[11:19] blood of the martyrs. Think about that.
[11:23] That's that that's the works of her
[11:25] hands. That's how she's clothed herself.
[11:28] Of course, if you're going to if you're
[11:30] going to take upon yourself to close
[11:32] your clothe yourself, you're going to do
[11:34] it in the best that the world has has to
[11:35] offer, right? But you're going to do it
[11:38] your way and you're you're not going to
[11:40] submit yourself to Christ because if
[11:42] Christ has made an offer, here's my
[11:44] word. Here's my vindicated truth. and
[11:46] you say,
[11:48] "I got my own thing going on." You know,
[11:52] and and again, look, there's nice people
[11:55] in many churches around the world. And
[11:59] there's no discounting that there's nice
[12:01] people, really wonderful people. But
[12:04] there's a great difference between being
[12:07] a nice person and being walking in the
[12:09] truth.
[12:10] Because you can you could say, "I'm a
[12:12] nice person." but your denomination is
[12:14] teaching you that there's three gods.
[12:17] There's a there's a major problem. You
[12:19] you could be a nice person, but your
[12:21] denomination is teaching you to
[12:22] disbelieve God's word. All of them do
[12:25] it. You say, "No, I heard the I heard
[12:28] the Baptist church telling us to believe
[12:30] God's word." Yeah, to a certain extent,
[12:32] sure. I I I I used to be a reformed
[12:35] Baptist. I believe God's word, but what
[12:38] happens when you're confronted with a
[12:40] revelation of the truth?
[12:42] Amen. What what happens if you're
[12:44] confronted with something simple like
[12:46] Acts 2:38?
[12:49] Are we going to make Matthew 28:19 fight
[12:52] Acts 238? Or are we going to simply say
[12:55] amen? They're both true. And I and this
[12:58] is how the name of the Father, Son, and
[13:00] Holy Ghost is the name of the Lord Jesus
[13:02] Christ. Take that simple thing and bring
[13:05] it to every denomination. I challenge
[13:07] you if you're struggling with this
[13:09] message. Take that simple thing. Go to
[13:11] every single denomination and ask them
[13:14] what they say to you. I can already tell
[13:16] you what they can say. A they're going
[13:17] to say it doesn't matter.
[13:21] They're B they're going to say well
[13:23] Jesus said this and we'll take what
[13:26] Jesus said. Or C they're going to say
[13:29] well Jesus the way Jesus did it was
[13:32] correct. Um and the apostle Peter was
[13:35] simply saying like by we baptize you in
[13:38] the name of father son and holy ghost by
[13:39] the authority of Jesus Christ. So they
[13:42] have to re they can't just take the word
[13:44] leave it as it is and say this fits here
[13:47] like this because of this. They can't do
[13:49] that. They're going to tell give you one
[13:50] of those three answers and what and
[13:52] that's a that's a red flag for me that
[13:55] you don't believe God's word. if it
[13:58] wouldn't cause you to struggle and look
[14:00] and say, "We have a problem with
[14:02] denominations right now." God gave us
[14:05] such an incredible clue right there that
[14:08] denom that the denominational system and
[14:11] those who are rejecting turning away
[14:13] from the message, they cannot answer
[14:15] that.
[14:17] How shocking should that be? For me,
[14:19] that was the most shocking thing I've
[14:20] ever heard in my life. When that when
[14:23] that brother introduced the message to
[14:24] me and told me about wa water baptism in
[14:27] my college, I was confronted by God's
[14:30] word. And I I was immediately I had to
[14:32] say, is is what I'm reading in God's
[14:35] word true or is the whole is the history
[14:39] of the Orthodox church true?
[14:43] And then you have to go and say, well,
[14:46] I'm a Bible believer. I could care less
[14:48] what this authority says and that
[14:51] authority says and that authority says.
[14:53] Amen.
[14:53] I was a I grew up a Lutheran. I heard
[14:55] about Martin Luther's story all the
[14:57] time. And when I I was always captivated
[15:00] by my heart is captive to the word of
[15:03] God. I can do no other. That's it. My
[15:06] conscience is captive to the word of
[15:08] God. Where else are we going to go?
[15:10] You're going to go to a denomination.
[15:12] You're going to go to a place that's
[15:13] teaching father, son, and holy ghost
[15:15] baptism. They can't get to very the very
[15:19] first base in scripture. They don't have
[15:22] the very first base of the gospel
[15:24] restored to them.
[15:27] They've completely missed it. And what
[15:28] is it? We'll have our own bread. That's
[15:30] what happens. We're talking about being
[15:32] confronted with God's word. You say, "I
[15:35] believe God's word." Me, too. But what
[15:37] about if you're confronted with
[15:38] something that you don't understand? Are
[15:41] you going to say, "Okay, Lord, I don't
[15:44] understand it. Your word is true. Not my
[15:47] church, not my thinking, not my not my
[15:50] theological background,
[15:52] but God's word is true. That's where the
[15:54] confrontation takes place. And that's
[15:56] where you either commit adultery against
[15:58] Christ or you stay true to him.
[16:00] You say, "I'm so I'm not committing. I
[16:03] love Christ." You love a version of
[16:05] Christ.
[16:08] And I I I I wish I could open the net
[16:10] and say everybody's just fine. That's
[16:13] what my flesh wants to say. everybody's
[16:15] just fine.
[16:16] But that's not what we're bound to.
[16:18] We're bound to point people to God's
[16:20] word, and we have to stay with the
[16:22] vindicated truth
[16:23] that we've received by scripture. And
[16:25] so, you're looking at at at this is they
[16:27] say, "We'll have our own bread.
[16:30] We'll take our own raignment." I hope
[16:32] that's striking you. What a dangerous
[16:35] situation is. And it's a perfect the
[16:37] church is perfectly reflected by the
[16:40] woman and feminist movement of today.
[16:42] Amen. of the last 120 140 years
[16:47] they've said we don't need God's order
[16:50] we don't need God's purpose we don't
[16:52] need the woman said I don't need a
[16:54] husband
[16:56] I don't I don't have need of I can do
[16:58] everything on my own well is that God's
[17:00] order
[17:02] is that God's God's program
[17:05] no it's not what is what I better leave
[17:10] you leave you that
[17:12] Hebrews 5:25-27, "Husbands, love your
[17:15] wives, even as Christ also loved the
[17:17] church and gave himself for it, that he
[17:19] might sanctify and cleanse it with the
[17:21] washing of water by the word." Now,
[17:24] we're going to see Christ being the
[17:27] source of a washing. Our garments were
[17:31] filthy. The garments got filthy through
[17:33] the denominational systems. But then
[17:35] there came a message of restoration that
[17:37] was to cleanse and wash us by the
[17:39] washing of the water of the word. That's
[17:41] what the message is sent for. You can't
[17:43] be washed by a perverted word. You have
[17:45] to be wa washed by a clean word,
[17:49] completely restored word. So that's what
[17:52] the message came to wash us. It's we we
[17:55] we get brother Brandham brought the
[17:58] message but this was Christ coming and
[18:00] he vindicated that by the supernatural
[18:04] that was coming through his ministry.
[18:05] God proved it over and over and over
[18:08] again that this was him coming to wash
[18:11] his church
[18:14] for what? That he might present it to
[18:15] himself a glorious church not having
[18:18] spot or wrinkle or any such thing but
[18:20] that it should be holy and without
[18:22] blemish. And isn't that perfectly
[18:24] fitting to the gospel? We can't provide
[18:26] our own bread and reignment. That's our
[18:28] own works. It's all filthiness in the
[18:30] sight of God. It has to be Christ's come
[18:34] to supply us with the washing and with
[18:37] the garment.
[18:39] Revelation 197 and 8. Let us be glad and
[18:42] rejoice and give honor to him for the
[18:43] marriage of the lamb has come is come
[18:46] and his wife hath made herself ready.
[18:49] She's made herself ready. Absolutely.
[18:51] But look how how she made herself ready
[18:54] and to her was granted. What does it
[18:56] mean when it's granted? It means it's
[18:58] given to you.
[19:00] You didn't make it yourself. You didn't
[19:02] create it yourself. It was granted to
[19:04] you. It's given. Means it was in
[19:06] somebody else's possession and they gave
[19:08] it to you as a gift. That she should be
[19:11] arrayed in fine linen, clean and white.
[19:15] For the fine linen is the righteousness
[19:17] of saints. She didn't provide her own
[19:19] reignment. She was given this fine
[19:23] linen, clean and white. It's not merely
[19:25] a white robe, but it's a it's a
[19:27] beautiful, expensive, glorious garment,
[19:29] but it's white. It's not purple and
[19:33] scarlet. And it's not it and it's
[19:35] simple. It's humble. It's not arrayed
[19:37] with pearls and gold and all all these
[19:40] other things and a a golden cup. No,
[19:43] it's it's not that. It's a simple,
[19:45] humble, but beautiful fine linen, clean
[19:49] and white. Because that fine linen is
[19:52] the righteousness of saints. Now, I want
[19:54] to ask you, who what's the righteousness
[19:55] of saints?
[19:59] All our own righteousness is as filthy
[20:01] rags. What is the righteousness of
[20:02] saints? It's the righteousness of Christ
[20:06] imputed unto her. Brother Brandham says,
[20:08] I it's not my righteousness. I don't
[20:11] have any.
[20:11] Amen. That's right. It's his it's his
[20:13] righteousness. So he clothe us in this
[20:17] fine linen which is representing that's
[20:19] his righteousness that we're clothed in.
[20:22] But you can't clothe yourself in it by
[20:24] your own works, by your own word, by
[20:26] your own doctrine, by your own theology.
[20:29] You have to be clothed in it by the word
[20:30] that Christ delivers. And he has
[20:33] delivered.
[20:34] And he made sure of that we would
[20:35] understand it by vindicating it over and
[20:37] over and over again.
[20:38] Amen.
[20:41] Ephesians 5:22-
[20:44] 24. Wives, submit yourselves unto your
[20:46] own husbands as unto the Lord. For the
[20:50] husband is the head of the wife, even as
[20:53] Christ is the head of the church, and he
[20:55] is the savior of the body. Therefore, as
[20:57] the church is subject unto Christ, so
[20:59] let the wives be to their own husbands.
[21:01] When you get a society that's so out of
[21:04] order,
[21:05] it's flip this around. This is what it
[21:07] is. If you if you watch enough uh memes
[21:11] and men talking, what is the reality is
[21:13] they get married and their wife does
[21:15] everything. She she does the finances,
[21:18] she cooks and cleans, she goes to work,
[21:21] she makes the schedule, and what does he
[21:23] sit? I don't even know what's going on.
[21:27] I'm just watching the football game and
[21:29] beer appears in my hand,
[21:32] you know. And he goes to work. Sure, he
[21:34] works, too. But his wife's in control of
[21:37] everything
[21:39] and he's just walking along as a
[21:41] submissive puppy. And what do you think?
[21:44] There's depression. Women are depressed.
[21:46] Women will fill the role of leadership
[21:48] if men refuse to do it. Absolutely they
[21:51] will. But men are are, you know, we can
[21:54] go on. There's so many layers of this.
[21:56] And we're going to get into it, but it
[21:57] won't be this time. There's so many
[21:59] layers
[22:01] that the devil has attacked. Yes. Amen.
[22:05] He started in in the the 1800s and he
[22:09] began a slow and methodical process of
[22:13] attacking the home and attacking the
[22:15] church. And he did it and his purpose
[22:18] was to effeminize men. And he did it in
[22:22] the natural realm. He did it in the
[22:23] spiritual realm. And he and he did it in
[22:26] the in the mental realm. He did it all
[22:28] three levels. He attacked it. It's very
[22:31] clear. We're going to we're going to get
[22:32] to that probably next time. But the
[22:35] purpose was to flip this upside down.
[22:38] Why did he want to flip it upside down
[22:40] in the home? Because he was flipping it
[22:43] upside down in the church. He was going
[22:45] to make a woman a leader. He was going
[22:47] to make her the preacher. She's going to
[22:49] make her deacons and elders. And he was
[22:51] going to let her be the one that
[22:54] supplies the bread. You know, both both
[22:57] as in the physical women preachers.
[23:01] Every denomination has it beside
[23:03] Catholic and some Baptist. Every
[23:06] denomination has it. It's ABC. You have
[23:10] to do theological headstands to overcome
[23:13] the scripture that says, "I suffer not a
[23:16] woman to teach or to usurp authority
[23:18] over a man."
[23:19] You see, you see all of this is being
[23:21] turned upside down because it's a
[23:24] perfect representation of what's
[23:26] happening in the spiritual realm.
[23:28] Christ is being they are they are
[23:31] seeking to lead Christ around the way
[23:35] that they want to and they're
[23:37] representing that to the world. We're in
[23:39] control. We make the interpretation. You
[23:42] see that word? It doesn't really mean
[23:44] that because Phoebe was a preacher. Oh
[23:47] yeah, Phoebe was following around Paul
[23:50] and he was having to preach all the
[23:51] time. Come on.
[23:55] You know, and and this is the this is
[23:57] the interpretation that they want to put
[23:59] on it and say Christ redeemed everything
[24:02] and restored everything. So now woman's
[24:04] a preacher and now woman's in the pulpit
[24:07] and leadership position. Well, I want to
[24:08] ask a question just a simple question.
[24:11] How in the world is a woman can be the
[24:15] husband of one wife?
[24:17] Well, okay, in modern America, but I
[24:19] mean, I'm talking about in the light of
[24:22] scripture. Maybe you you profess to
[24:24] believe a little bit of the Bible, but
[24:26] the that's the issue is as soon as you
[24:28] put a woman in the pulpit, what's the
[24:30] next result? You you're going to go
[24:32] woke.
[24:34] Amen.
[24:34] It's just a matter of time. Every
[24:37] denomination that's done it, name me one
[24:40] that hasn't. Episcopalian,
[24:42] what have they done?
[24:45] Methodists, what have they done?
[24:47] Lutheran,
[24:49] what have they done? You see, they're
[24:51] they're they're trying to make
[24:53] themselves appealing to the culture. The
[24:56] culture don't like church anyway.
[24:58] All right?
[25:00] So, don't try to appeal to them.
[25:01] Offer them something different.
[25:04] offer them something that's real and
[25:06] true and solid. If they won't hear the
[25:08] word of God, that's their problem.
[25:11] They're going to suffer for that. Our
[25:12] job is to declare it as it stands, not
[25:15] adjust ourselves to the culture and to
[25:18] the times. We don't have husbands,
[25:20] submit yourselves unto your wives as
[25:22] unto the Lord. We don't have the wife is
[25:25] the head of the husband even as the
[25:27] church is the head of Christ.
[25:30] That's not what it that's not reality.
[25:32] That's not how God designed us. As we
[25:34] talked about last time, God's initial
[25:36] design was for man to be a leader.
[25:39] This that's what it said in first
[25:41] Timothy. Paul appealing to the fact that
[25:43] women shouldn't be preachers said that
[25:45] Adam was created first. That's not the
[25:47] result of the fall. That's a result of
[25:49] God's design.
[25:51] He made a man to be ahead. Now, he
[25:53] didn't mean him to be ahead as in a
[25:55] dictator. He ma he said he said you
[25:58] you'll lead, you'll provide. You'll
[26:01] sacrifice yourself. You'll be a servant
[26:04] to your family.
[26:06] Right?
[26:07] He he he speaks of this kind of
[26:08] leadership, not a dictatorship. Christ
[26:11] redeems a woman from the dictatorship
[26:14] rule of a man into the rule of love
[26:19] be sacrificing yourself.
[26:21] But he doesn't reverse the order. You
[26:23] say, but it says there's no male,
[26:25] there's no female in Christ.
[26:30] Okay. What is that? What what do you
[26:33] think that means? Means that we all come
[26:35] to Christ directly and we're all one in
[26:38] him. That doesn't change our roles. That
[26:41] doesn't change what what God created us
[26:43] to be.
[26:45] He created a woman to be a weaker
[26:47] vessel. He created a man to be a
[26:49] stronger vessel.
[26:51] There's nothing to apologize for.
[26:54] You should be you should be thankful for
[26:56] God's order. The way that a man and a
[27:00] woman will be happy is when they
[27:02] actually enter into God's correct order.
[27:06] What the people that don't do that,
[27:08] they're unhappy. They're they're
[27:10] suicidal
[27:11] and life is horrible
[27:14] and they'll complain about every little
[27:16] thing. They complain about their
[27:17] marriage. It's just it's mystifying to
[27:20] me
[27:22] that these spirits will try to get on us
[27:25] that are following this message. But we
[27:28] have to fight
[27:29] Amen.
[27:29] against these spirits because that's the
[27:31] spirit of the age that's trying to come
[27:33] and conquer us. Ben, lead your home. You
[27:35] don't lead with rigor. You lead with
[27:37] love and service. But you, it's your job
[27:39] to be the provider. Provide means
[27:42] provision. Means to see ahead of h of of
[27:45] time and and and make the steps to meet
[27:49] the need that's there. And that's not
[27:51] just for food. That's not just for
[27:53] clothing. That's spiritually speaking.
[27:56] You're supposed to lead your family.
[27:57] You're supposed to see the dangers and
[27:58] the pitfalls and make decisions and
[28:01] choices and pull things away and put
[28:04] things there and and you're supposed to
[28:05] see those things to lead your family
[28:07] with the wisdom of the Holy Spirit.
[28:10] All right, I'm going to close right
[28:12] there. Let's stand.
[28:19] There's so much here. It's just
[28:20] incredible looking at this.
[28:23] We'll continue at some point here.
[28:26] Heavenly Father, we just come to you,
[28:28] Lord, and we ask that your Holy Spirit
[28:29] would move and work in our hearts,
[28:32] minds, and lives today, Lord. I pray
[28:33] that you would help us to to glorify you
[28:36] and get our eyes and our hearts fixed
[28:38] upon you, Lord. We ask it in Jesus name.
[28:40] Amen. God bless you.
