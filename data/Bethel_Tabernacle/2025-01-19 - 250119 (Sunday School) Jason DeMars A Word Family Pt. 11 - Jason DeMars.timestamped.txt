[0:19] Psalm
[0:20] 127 verse
[0:23] 3 Lo children are inheritage of the Lord
[0:27] and the fruit of the womb is his reward
[0:31] Heavenly Father we just come before you
[0:32] Lord and we're so thankful for your
[0:35] light in this hour Lord we know that
[0:38] Darkness even gross
[0:41] darkness is covering the Earth Lord but
[0:44] we also know that you've said in that
[0:47] very same verse that AR arise and shine
[0:49] for thy light has come and so Lord in
[0:52] the age of gross Darkness your light
[0:56] shines even brighter to your elect Lord
[0:59] thank you for that pray that you'd
[1:01] reveal yourself more and more Lord that
[1:03] you'd speak to us this morning Lord and
[1:05] that you'd be glorified in our midst
[1:08] today we ask in Jesus name amen God
[1:10] bless you can be
[1:16] seated as we finished last week um
[1:21] abruptly because I was going to a
[1:23] different not last week two two weeks
[1:27] ago uh finished abruptly a little bit
[1:30] early because I didn't want to go into
[1:32] the next topic um we're going to be
[1:36] looking at uh God's heart and attitude
[1:40] towards children and again I think
[1:43] sometimes you have have to come with a
[1:46] few disclaimers we understand there's
[1:48] different situations we're not here uh
[1:51] to tell you how many children to have
[1:53] when to have them how to have them but
[1:55] just simply announce to you what the
[1:57] word of God says and what attitude the
[2:00] word wants us to have different
[2:02] situations different people but the main
[2:05] thing is that our attitude should
[2:07] reflect the same attitude that God's
[2:09] heart has about children amen with the
[2:13] understanding of what is our what is
[2:15] what did God create us for what was the
[2:18] original purpose what was the design for
[2:21] man and woman when we can see that and
[2:24] understand that we can see God's
[2:26] attitude towards children another aspect
[2:29] of it I hear often uh and it's very very
[2:33] uh culturally based and personally based
[2:36] but people start having a few kids when
[2:38] they first get married and they quote
[2:40] brother brandom what he said to Billy
[2:42] Paul as though that was a
[2:45] Doctrine he didn't give you the full
[2:48] responsibility to replenish the fill up
[2:51] the Earth of course uh it's a little bit
[2:54] of a joke uh not a
[2:57] Doctrine um and and we want to see what
[3:00] God's attitude and heart is and more
[3:03] than just that quote what brother
[3:04] brandom speaks about it so we're going
[3:07] to
[3:08] look in this sermon um invisible Union
[3:12] brother brandom says speaking of the day
[3:14] that when women couldn't no more
[3:16] wouldn't no more want children were
[3:19] living in that
[3:22] day they want a dog or a cat or
[3:24] something like that but she don't want
[3:26] children anymore did you realize that
[3:28] brother brandom proph side about liberal
[3:30] cat
[3:35] ladies she don't want children anymore
[3:39] why she's old mother hubard if she has a
[3:41] child see she don't want that's the
[3:43] remarks of
[3:45] Hollywood it don't want his woman to be
[3:47] an old mother hubard so she'll he'll
[3:49] have some operation performed to himself
[3:52] or her one that'll keep them from having
[3:55] children they don't they don't want no
[3:58] children
[4:00] Jesus spoke of it and what did he say at
[4:03] that time they'll begin to cry for the
[4:05] rocks and the mountains to fall on us
[4:08] she'll practice birth control so she can
[4:10] go to parties she can't be bothered with
[4:12] a baby nursing her it'll disform her
[4:15] when she's pregnated it'll be it'll it
[4:17] disform her she won't doesn't want to
[4:19] look like she used she won't look like
[4:21] she used to and her husband ignorant
[4:24] enough to let her go that way she won't
[4:28] give him a child
[4:30] Jesus spoke of it and he said that when
[4:32] they were doing this at that time
[4:33] they'll go to crying then for the rocks
[4:36] to fall on them it's the coming of the
[4:39] Lord they pay great sums of money for
[4:42] cats dogs to
[4:44] mother this is obviously a very
[4:47] prophetic statement and a a very uh much
[4:51] a fulfilled prophetic statement of God's
[4:55] prophet and this has become the attitude
[4:59] of the world world today towards
[5:01] children they're an
[5:02] inconvenience they interrupt your life
[5:04] and even this same kind of attitude can
[5:08] permeate into the Christian Community
[5:10] they interrupt your life they're they're
[5:13] difficult we'll have kids and then let's
[5:15] hurry let's hurry through this process
[5:18] and get rid of them so we can go back to
[5:20] doing what we like to do it is a spirit
[5:24] of selfishness it's a spirit of Pride
[5:28] it's a spirit that that's against God's
[5:31] heart God's mind and God's
[5:34] attitude uh towards
[5:37] children and and unfortunately we can
[5:40] easily fall prey to this I think we need
[5:42] to ask the Lord to cleanse our hearts
[5:45] and our minds our children are a gift
[5:48] amen they're a
[5:50] blessing
[5:52] and from anyone that has any perspective
[5:55] with the Holy Ghost they could say
[5:57] please soak up every minute of your your
[6:00] children enjoy them the the the love
[6:04] that you put into them and the sacrifice
[6:07] that you put into them will pay the
[6:09] dividends to you later
[6:15] hundredfold in questions and answers law
[6:18] having a
[6:19] shadow uh a baby's and I don't want to
[6:23] again I don't want to go into the Weeds
[6:24] about birth control if you look at this
[6:27] quote brother bham quotes about birth
[6:29] control I think we can generally say
[6:32] what what brother brandham said which
[6:34] was he's not for it right and then on
[6:38] the other hand he said there's certain
[6:39] situations where it would be a catastro
[6:42] would be would mean death um but he said
[6:46] he he said he didn't want to make that a
[6:48] public statement he said caseby casee
[6:51] basis but he did a number of times make
[6:54] BL blanket statements that he was not in
[6:56] favor of it right but he said I want to
[6:59] talk to the person
[7:01] individually so again we can look at it
[7:05] as in general number one is we can can
[7:07] look at the big picture and say birth
[7:10] control wasn't what was created for a
[7:14] purpose I don't believe God was the one
[7:17] that created birth control birth control
[7:19] was created right in the midst of the
[7:21] time
[7:23] of the maturing of feminism where we
[7:28] don't want the responsib we we either
[7:30] want to prevent the pregnancy using
[7:32] birth control pills and of course this
[7:36] obliterates a woman's system obliterates
[7:39] her body not functioning the way God
[7:41] designed it right and secondarily they
[7:44] they wanted if they couldn't prevent the
[7:46] pregnancy they wanted to have abortion
[7:50] when when first birth control was
[7:53] legalized next abortion was legalized
[8:00] I got a little bit into the weeds but
[8:02] not too
[8:04] far brother brandom says a baby baby's a
[8:07] baby when it's formed the very first
[8:09] germ in the mother's womb it's a baby
[8:11] I'm firmly against birth control see yes
[8:14] sir for where it's just as much to take
[8:17] the life of a little baby that ain't two
[8:19] months old as it is to pull a pistol and
[8:21] shoot a man down in Cold Blood murder
[8:24] yes sir I'm against birth control what
[8:27] God sends God will take care of Amen
[8:31] notice now that is wrong to do that now
[8:33] the baby's right there it's a life for
[8:35] the first
[8:37] germ of life is in it which it'll only
[8:40] be the life that'll enter lets other
[8:42] Spirits in then the baby becomes
[8:44] begotten it's little muscles quiver and
[8:46] jump and twist like that then that's the
[8:48] next thing then the water the blood and
[8:50] then it has to when it breaks the little
[8:51] lungs through just as the natural baby
[8:53] is born there's a spiritual body at the
[8:55] side of the mother to give the baby a
[8:57] spiritual life amen from the
[9:01] very moment of conception that's a
[9:05] baby that's a human life it's not
[9:08] somewhere down the line at the very
[9:11] moment that happens
[9:14] that's a little human being made in the
[9:18] image and likeness of
[9:20] God and it's absolutely evil and it's
[9:23] taking a life as the prophet said it's
[9:26] murder it's coldblooded murder
[9:29] it's not women's health
[9:31] care it's
[9:34] murder amen this as we y'all are quiet
[9:37] this morning it's making me
[9:40] nervous maybe I'm making y'all
[9:45] nervous the Bible says that a woman is
[9:48] saved in child childbearing and as we
[9:51] looked at before it's not that me that
[9:54] childbearing is the means of her
[9:56] salvation the means of her salvation is
[9:58] the same as same as any elect of all
[10:02] ages and that's only through the blood
[10:04] of Jesus Christ and it comes to us as a
[10:07] gift of faith he gives us Faith amen
[10:11] it's his calling it's his work in our
[10:13] hearts and yet we understand that there
[10:16] is an aspect in motherhood or or in
[10:20] Womanhood where part of her out working
[10:23] should God choose to give her a child
[10:25] will be how she administers herself as a
[10:29] mother and as a a her attitude towards
[10:33] the children and how she behaves it is
[10:36] not the means of her salvation but it's
[10:38] the
[10:39] outworking we're created in Christ
[10:41] Christ Jesus unto good works which God
[10:44] has before ordained that we should walk
[10:46] in them what better work is there than a
[10:49] than a mother to Bear a child and to
[10:52] raise that for the
[10:53] gospel that is a that is a foreordained
[10:57] before the foundational of the world
[10:59] work that he's placed upon mothers and
[11:04] of course also
[11:06] fathers you think about the attitude
[11:08] towards children and the attitude
[11:11] towards the value of life in the hour
[11:14] that we live
[11:18] in they want to take the life of a baby
[11:22] so they can have their life whatever
[11:27] that means but the true expression of
[11:31] motherhood is she is willing to impart
[11:34] her own life for her
[11:37] children that's real and genuine
[11:41] motherhood and it's also an expression
[11:43] of the Bride we should be willing to
[11:47] offer our own life on the altar in order
[11:51] to find that last predestinated
[11:57] seed and well if I have a child
[12:00] Everything Will Change that's
[12:03] right that's right praise the Lord
[12:06] you'll stop being so
[12:13] selfish amen having getting married and
[12:16] having children is part of the
[12:19] sanctification
[12:20] process if you're a true child of God
[12:23] one of the predestinated seed God will
[12:25] use that to hone you and mold you and
[12:29] shape you amen nothing's made perfect
[12:32] without
[12:36] suffering but at the same time you can
[12:38] all understand sister Jean is it worth
[12:41] it
[12:44] all it's a
[12:46] treasure
[12:51] and as the baby grows in mother's womb
[12:56] nutrients are taken from her body goes
[13:00] to the baby then the byproduct the waste
[13:04] comes out of mother comes out of the
[13:06] baby into the mother for her to process
[13:08] it through her body of course her body
[13:13] grows and changes shape because of those
[13:16] children that's part of the
[13:19] process we we think we think of that our
[13:22] society thinks of that it's deformed no
[13:24] actually you're fall you're coming into
[13:26] your correct
[13:28] form husbands make sure your wives
[13:30] understand that she's coming into her
[13:33] correct form the the the the into the
[13:36] work that God had before ordained for
[13:38] her to walk
[13:41] in and the fact is there's a great
[13:44] Beauty to that I think we should
[13:47] understand that reality and that should
[13:48] be part of our thoughts not you're
[13:50] getting big are you gaining weight are
[13:52] you this negative attitude about
[13:56] pregnancy this is part of this is the
[13:58] worldly way of
[14:00] thinking we shouldn't think that way we
[14:02] shouldn't talk that way it's a great
[14:05] blessing to a grow a
[14:07] child within within your
[14:10] womb and there's a great Beauty to it
[14:13] that can never be repeated outside of
[14:17] that then of course when the baby's born
[14:21] mother goes through great pain in
[14:24] childbirth and her body's changed
[14:27] forever
[14:29] she begins to nurse coming forth from
[14:31] her body she feeds her children this is
[14:37] this is the most
[14:38] amazing incredible
[14:41] process that we that we can be a part of
[14:44] it is magical brother
[14:51] Kevin
[14:53] and a mother a true mother with the Holy
[14:57] Ghost there's a love that she has has
[14:59] for her children that is unexplainable
[15:03] and
[15:03] inexpressible it goes far
[15:07] beyond understanding she cares for them
[15:10] she feeds them she teaches them this is
[15:14] what should be lifted up
[15:17] as as great as
[15:20] wonderful as a
[15:23] blessing now of course God can ordain
[15:25] that a uh uh
[15:29] someone be single for their life and God
[15:32] has a purpose in all of that but as the
[15:36] prophet said there's a perversion when
[15:39] the vision of a woman is I want to
[15:42] remain single and I want to have cats
[15:44] and
[15:46] dogs the the the the selfishness and
[15:49] self-centeredness now I know I know
[15:51] Christian women that weren't able to
[15:53] have children and that's not but that
[15:56] wasn't their heart's desire that was n't
[15:59] their passion but God by his Providence
[16:01] so designed that and we honor them as
[16:06] well and real
[16:09] men will see what their wife has gone
[16:13] through is going through am and it will
[16:16] be everything within his heart that he
[16:20] wants to take care of his companion his
[16:23] best friend and his
[16:25] sweetheart he understands what his
[16:27] responsibility
[16:29] is in this
[16:31] process and he knows that he must guide
[16:33] his
[16:34] family as we said
[16:36] before young men all men when you sign
[16:41] up to become a husband you are now a
[16:45] teacher you are now a priest you are now
[16:49] a worship leader that is to be your
[16:52] function in the home if you didn't know
[16:55] that before now you know it now
[16:59] it's your responsibility to correct if
[17:03] you love your family if you love your
[17:05] wife if you love your children you'll
[17:08] correct them not with pride but with
[17:10] humility knowing your own weaknesses
[17:13] amen you'll be someone that
[17:17] listens when when your wife is
[17:20] struggling or maybe when she's nagging
[17:23] you you should shut up and
[17:27] listen because maybe you weren't
[17:32] listening and now you need now it's your
[17:35] CH chance to sit down and listen
[17:39] closely because sometime sometimes it's
[17:41] a neag and sometimes it's a cry there's
[17:44] a cry that's going out sit down and
[17:47] listen to your wife and hear what she
[17:49] has to
[17:51] say cuz you'll find something out you
[17:54] might learn
[17:56] something we should understand that that
[17:59] men as the stronger vessel she's the
[18:01] weaker vessel don't look at as it always
[18:04] as an
[18:06] annoyance look at it as a chance to be
[18:10] together because the reality is you're
[18:12] supposed to complete the image and
[18:14] likeness of God together in Oneness
[18:18] right in your Oneness and out of your
[18:21] Oneness the image of God is manifested
[18:26] expressed and
[18:27] multiplied and it's not just a physical
[18:30] Oneness it needs to be beyond that it
[18:32] needs to be a spiritual emotional
[18:34] emotional mental Oneness that Finds Its
[18:37] expression in the physical act which
[18:40] produces
[18:41] offspring and then we find that that is
[18:44] a blessing and a fruit of that
[18:47] Oneness Christ and the
[18:50] bride ma the manifestation of God
[18:54] himself it's not just Christ before the
[18:57] foundation of the world Christ was first
[19:00] right but what was next you in him the
[19:05] elect in him a part of him we were
[19:07] chosen in him before the foundation of
[19:10] the world and this is to be the very
[19:12] expression of life and the multip
[19:16] multiplication of that life and that's
[19:19] what family
[19:23] is either you're thinking or you're
[19:26] annoyed or uh
[19:29] you're listening okay we'll go with that
[19:31] brother
[19:36] Luther a modest kind holy Godly Meek and
[19:42] quiet woman is the crown of her husband
[19:45] and even as we look at scripture she is
[19:47] literally the crown of creation the very
[19:50] last thing in the process created was
[19:54] the it was the
[19:56] woman a man was made
[19:59] to rule to be strong to love and provide
[20:02] and care for those under his
[20:06] authority a true Godly family is the
[20:08] Pinnacle of
[20:10] creation not presidents not the White
[20:13] House not Kings sure they can be a part
[20:16] of it but they're they're no more the
[20:18] Pinnacle of
[20:20] creation than one of us humble
[20:25] people God Delights in a true family
[20:29] where the Holy Holy Ghost is the center
[20:32] and the word is the
[20:36] absolute Psalm
[20:38] 127 pull up my PowerPoint again verse
[20:42] three we read it already we'll read it
[20:45] again Lo children are in Heritage of the
[20:49] Lord and the fruit of the womb is his
[20:52] reward
[20:54] amen as arrows are in the hand of a
[20:58] mighty man so are children of the
[21:02] youth happy is the man that H happy is
[21:06] the man that hath his quiver full of
[21:07] them they shall not be ashamed but they
[21:10] shall speak with the enemies in the
[21:14] gate again we've developed this attitude
[21:17] in Western culture children are an
[21:18] inconvenience now they don't have this
[21:20] attitude in eastern
[21:24] cultures but in in our culture and we
[21:26] are seen really the death of our culture
[21:30] I don't want to get going too too much
[21:31] on that but because of its departure or
[21:35] maybe I will get going a little bit on
[21:37] it that because of because of the
[21:41] rejection of the word of God in Western
[21:44] culture you find in in in Europe in
[21:49] America um we've turned away from the
[21:53] principles that God has laid forth in
[21:56] his word and when we turn away from the
[21:57] pr principles
[21:59] God has laid forth in his word then that
[22:01] that culture
[22:02] dies and the gospel I think that as I
[22:05] observe this and see this the gospel
[22:07] goes around the world starts in the East
[22:10] goes to the West travels back to the
[22:11] east again and as we as we see and
[22:15] observe that um some of the very first
[22:18] places that received the gospel and it
[22:21] became all-encompassing to that culture
[22:24] is the Middle East turkey Syria
[22:29] these different places and the you know
[22:31] this is where we find Antioch and Asia
[22:35] Minor and galatia all these places and
[22:39] they became areas that everyone was
[22:42] fully Christan Christian paganism was
[22:45] totally rooted out and yet as time went
[22:48] on they turned away from the gospel went
[22:52] to a formal
[22:55] religion intermixing paganism within it
[22:59] and when that happened God raised up
[23:01] judgment what was it the Arab
[23:05] conquests the Muslims and I I used to
[23:08] think in Turkey here's a perfect example
[23:10] of it in Turkey what happened was the
[23:12] Muslims didn't come and convert the
[23:14] Christians the Muslims came and replaced
[23:16] them and pushed them
[23:17] out and it was down to so so very few uh
[23:23] Byzantine Christians left that as time
[23:26] went on they literally went out of
[23:29] existence as not just as a faith but as
[23:34] a people we see the same thing following
[23:37] suit the
[23:39] Muslim again we're getting into the
[23:42] weeds but we're looking at the reality
[23:43] of what's Happening into the
[23:46] world Muslims are moving and instead of
[23:49] marching with armies we're just going
[23:51] come on take over our
[23:56] countries it's
[23:59] it's like what we would call cultural
[24:03] suicide and that right along with that
[24:06] is the
[24:08] hopelessness where people don't even
[24:11] want to get married and have children
[24:13] this is an evil and perverted it's a
[24:15] sign of
[24:18] judgment that's what brother brandham
[24:19] told us it's an absolute sign of
[24:22] judgment and we're finding that but God
[24:25] forbid this be the attitude in the bride
[24:28] of Jesus Christ amen regardless of the
[24:32] death of our perverted culture amen
[24:35] that's become so evil and regardless of
[24:39] the hope that uh some might feel that's
[24:42] coming
[24:45] tomorrow in Washington DC the reality is
[24:50] the change does not ha happen in
[24:53] politics politics is merely a reflection
[24:56] of what happens in in our homes and in
[24:59] our families
[25:01] amen and we as Believers of the word of
[25:05] God we go the way of the word regardless
[25:08] of what the culture around us tells
[25:13] us the culture tells us children are
[25:15] inconvenience and a difficulty and they
[25:18] change your body have cats and travel
[25:21] the
[25:23] world but scripture tells us
[25:26] that part of
[25:28] children are in Heritage of the lord
[25:31] they're an inheritance God is God is
[25:33] giving you of what belongs to him into
[25:37] your hands to raise that's what your
[25:39] children are he's committing to you his
[25:43] children to raise them up for what
[25:46] purpose for him
[25:49] amen so that they would know him that we
[25:53] have to realize that's our function as
[25:55] parents the function as parents is not
[25:57] to get them to school and make sure that
[25:59] they have food the function as parents
[26:02] is that your children would know the
[26:04] Lord that they would be raised in a home
[26:07] where worship isn't just on Wednesday
[26:09] and Sunday but worship is every
[26:12] day and that they're being established
[26:15] in the word by their father and
[26:18] mother and those children they're not
[26:21] just um little bundles of joy for us to
[26:26] enjoy their arrows yeah in other words
[26:30] there something that has to be aimed
[26:31] there's something that you you want to
[26:34] defeat the Devil raise up children that
[26:37] serve God then when you release them
[26:40] that's an
[26:41] arrow that strikes the
[26:45] enemy amen and even even goes to the
[26:48] place so are the children of the youth
[26:51] have kids
[26:53] young that's not my own Doctrine that's
[26:55] what the word says have children young
[26:58] if you
[27:00] can happy is the man that has his quiver
[27:03] full of them has a lot of them
[27:05] amen you shall not be ashamed well in in
[27:08] American culture practically you you
[27:11] know you have you have more than three
[27:13] kids or two kids are like my you have a
[27:15] big family
[27:22] wow all right I need to finish and I
[27:26] want to get to this quote from the
[27:28] presence of the Lord Jesus brother bam
[27:30] says on her Road she heard about this
[27:31] Elizabeth her cousin is going to have a
[27:33] baby so she runs up in the hilly country
[27:36] of Judea to see her it was a great honor
[27:38] then to have a baby it's a disgrace
[27:40] nearly now I'm not balling people out I
[27:44] Don't Preach by any notes I don't know
[27:45] what I'm going to say just I have to
[27:47] reach up and get it and when it comes I
[27:49] just have to say it that's all I know to
[27:51] do but today it's a dishonor almost to
[27:54] see a big family
[27:56] anymore yes sir they'd rather pay $100
[27:59] for a little snotty-nosed dog and pack
[28:01] it around and give it the love of a
[28:03] mother and practice birth control than
[28:05] to have children think that was
[28:08] something old going hang around to the
[28:09] barrooms and drink and play cards and
[28:11] run run around all afternoon in your
[28:13] husband's car why it's a disgrace that's
[28:16] right the greatest honor a woman can do
[28:20] outside of coming to Christ and being
[28:21] loyal to her husband is to have is have
[28:24] a baby amen you might be nursing a
[28:27] little preacher how do you know
[28:28] Hallelujah I know that's oldfashioned
[28:30] cornbread type but brother it'll stick
[28:32] to your ribs amen it'll do when you're
[28:36] dying it sure will amen so the Bible and
[28:41] brother brandham upholds having children
[28:44] as a reward and a blessing from God and
[28:48] an
[28:49] honor it's a the man that has his quiver
[28:52] full of them is
[28:55] blessed I can even remember going into
[28:58] hotels when we're traveling for Ministry
[28:59] work and I you know those those carriers
[29:02] you got them just full of people and all
[29:04] these men are business guys are walking
[29:06] by and they look at me and they frown
[29:08] and they say oh I'm so sorry and I it
[29:11] made me
[29:12] mad made me very mad sometimes I'd say
[29:15] sorry for
[29:16] what oh you got to do all that and have
[29:19] all those kids and I was like it's this
[29:21] is the greatest blessing of my
[29:25] life yes it's hard work
[29:29] but this is a blessing not something to
[29:31] be sorry about amen let's
[29:36] stand Heavenly Father we thank you so
[29:38] much for your goodness Lord for your
[29:40] mercy we thank you for blessing us in so
[29:42] many ways Lord we pray your Holy Spirit
[29:44] would just brood over your people today
[29:47] Lord that you would be with us in the
[29:49] worship and in the preaching of the word
[29:51] Lord be glorified in our midst we commit
[29:53] ourselves to you in Jesus name amen
