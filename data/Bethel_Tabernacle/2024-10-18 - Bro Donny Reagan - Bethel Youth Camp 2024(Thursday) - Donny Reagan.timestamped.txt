[0:28] that and a whole lot of the other thing

[0:38] that this will be a great outpouring of
[0:39] the Holy Spirit and that it'll visit
[0:42] each one of you in a very specific and
[0:44] very special
[0:46] way uh the fact that we're here I
[0:49] believe is ordained of God we know
[0:52] that's true regardless regardless of the
[0:55] circumstances but this year we can say
[0:57] it's a miracle that we're having camp
[1:02] um the camp is still standing power is
[1:05] on now and the roads are we're ready for
[1:09] all of us to get here so we know know
[1:11] the Lord has a a special purpose for
[1:13] each one of us during this camp and I
[1:16] believe that each one of us are uh
[1:19] expecting and anticipating this is I
[1:22] believe our fourth year of the camp and
[1:24] we've seen the Lord there's many
[1:27] miracles sitting amongst us us that many
[1:31] testimonies that have come from this
[1:32] camp and we're so thankful to the Lord
[1:35] Jesus for that um want to start off the
[1:38] service with a little camper orientation
[1:41] I'm Jason dears I'm the co-director of
[1:44] Camp somewhere on camp site is brother
[1:48] Matt Watkins he's the director of Camp

[2:55] it will happen and sometimes there's big
[2:57] groups of 30 people get up at once let's
[3:00] make sure not to do that use the
[3:01] restroom before you come in here I'm
[3:04] pretty sure unless there's a medical
[3:05] issue we can all uh make it through
[3:08] unless it's one of those services that
[3:10] goes to midnight or 2 a.m. and we
[3:13] understand but with that said if if

[5:11] expectations and clear consequences if
[5:13] rules are violated our counselor or
[5:16] security team team lead will issue a
[5:19] warning second violation is calling your
[5:22] parents and having them take you home uh
[5:25] this will be done obviously together
[5:27] with our leadership team we don't take
[5:28] that lightly we don't want want to do
[5:30] that but we reserve the right to do that
[5:33] if there's any violations that are
[5:35] egregious um some of them will be
[5:37] detailed uh below um obviously your
[5:40] parents expect us to provide you a safe
[5:42] and edifying atmosphere so number one
[5:45] boys are not allowed in the girls dorms
[5:48] and vice versa this can result in
[5:51] immediate expulsion both boys and girls
[5:53] are required to dress modestly at all
[5:55] times I won't go through all the details
[5:57] but we believe in what the prophet of
[5:59] God Tau hot us and we want to provide a
[6:01] good Godly environment for everyone it's
[6:05] not allowed to leave your cabin before

[6:33] inappropriate behavior which could
[6:35] result again in media exposion it's not
[6:38] allowed to watch movies or televis
[6:41] television shows on apps in the cabins
[6:44] when it's time for lights out put your

[43:06] place tonight are so different some of
[43:10] you from different states different
[43:14] regions of the country maybe you're
[43:15] facing different types of battles but
[43:18] the Lord Jesus I believe is ordained
[43:21] these times for us to be together and he
[43:24] knows every one of your needs some some
[43:27] of you might need something in your soul
[43:30] some of you in your spirit some of you
[43:32] in your body maybe some of you all three
[43:37] but he's
[43:38] mindful we're going to pray and as we do
[43:41] can we just hold our needs and our
[43:43] request at this Opening Service as we go
[43:46] to the Lord in prayer whatever your need
[43:48] is right
[43:50] now Heavenly Father we count it's such a
[43:53] great honor that we can stand before
[43:57] a great group of young
[43:59] people father young people that have
[44:02] been called out of the world called out
[44:04] of sin called out of religion called
[44:07] into the Gospel of Jesus Christ we're
[44:11] thankful father for this evening light
[44:15] that has come in this day to shine upon
[44:18] the seed to bring us into this great
[44:21] hour Lord as we start these few days of
[44:25] meetings we pray for your your
[44:28] leadership your divine
[44:30] intervention you're the only one that
[44:33] can custom fit a sermon that'll be able
[44:36] to touch every Hungry Heart
[44:38] Tonight There's no way any man could do
[44:41] that on his own so we commit the service
[44:44] to you Lord I pray that you would lead
[44:48] me in a way that would please you for
[44:50] this Opening
[44:51] Service father if there's a need here
[44:54] tonight that lays outside the confin of
[44:57] the way that I've studied that I pray
[44:59] you'd make me sensitive Lord maybe
[45:03] someone that would go back and hear the
[45:05] service or maybe a young lady a young
[45:07] man it may not take but a sentence or
[45:10] two and it'll be their
[45:12] answer so help me
[45:15] Jesus it's more than a preacher getting
[45:17] scriptures and quotes together it's
[45:20] being led of the Holy Ghost come tonight
[45:23] father we commit the service we commit
[45:26] the preaching of the word and the
[45:27] hearers all these Services all the
[45:30] efforts brother Jason and his church all
[45:32] those that have put forth would you
[45:34] bless it dear God May those things of
[45:37] Eternal value come out of these days
[45:40] that we are together in the name of the
[45:42] Lord Jesus we ask it amen praise the
[45:47] Lord if you would turn with me tonight
[45:49] to Isaiah chapter 59 verse 15 we greet
[45:53] you tonight in the name of the Lord
[45:54] Jesus we count it a great honor to be
[45:57] able to be with you all
[46:00] uh I was supposed to be here last year
[46:02] but as probably many of you know the
[46:05] Lord and his wisdom decided to take my
[46:09] daughter Erica home and I'm sure
[46:11] probably a lot of you prayed for her and
[46:13] we thank you for that it was actually a
[46:16] year ago
[46:17] yesterday um so we're happy she's not
[46:21] sick anymore happy that she's the Lord
[46:24] we thought the Lord was going to heal
[46:26] her and in her body and take away that
[46:29] cancer that she had fought for about 4
[46:31] years but the Lord's plan was to heal
[46:34] her of her
[46:36] mortality not just heal her
[46:39] temporarily so we're looking every day
[46:42] to be able to be gathered together of
[46:44] course not only with her but with Jesus
[46:46] first of all and all of our loved
[46:48] ones Isaiah chapter 59 verse um 15 I
[46:53] want to say what an honor it is for me
[46:55] to be able to preach the with u brother
[46:58] Andrew Glover um I remember from Brother
[47:01] Andrew was a little bitty boy about that
[47:04] big and uh went to our church long time
[47:07] ago that's right and uh it sent me a
[47:10] picture some time ago it was of him
[47:13] coming up for prayer and he always liked
[47:15] to come up for prayer he like to come up
[47:16] to the Altar and little bitty old guy
[47:18] and sit on the front row and I look at
[47:21] him today and what he's grown up into a
[47:23] fine fine man of God and what God's done
[47:26] through room it just makes makes you so
[47:29] happy and if the Lord terries before
[47:32] long I'm 68 years old and brother Jason
[47:36] of course is not that old but he's
[47:38] getting closer and these other brothers
[47:39] we're getting we're getting older and if
[47:42] the Lord terries who's going to take
[47:44] this
[47:45] message used to I could fulfill that
[47:48] quote that brother renom said that these
[47:51] young men will take this message and
[47:53] sweep it on to the coming of the Lord
[47:54] Jesus guess what I can't fulfill that
[47:56] that quote anymore so the Lord has got
[48:00] maybe young men here tonight maybe
[48:03] future Pastor wives evangelist wives so
[48:08] we're not just looking to you tonight as
[48:11] being the Church of tomorrow but you're
[48:14] the Church of today so you never know
[48:17] what God's allowing you to go through in
[48:18] the young years of your life don't think
[48:21] that well whenever I get 25 30 35
[48:24] whatever God may be allowing you to go
[48:26] through things this very week that will
[48:29] help mold you for the years are to come
[48:32] amen let's read together Isaiah chapter
[48:35] 59:1 15 ye truth
[48:40] fath and he that departeth from Evil
[48:44] maketh himself a
[48:47] prey and the Lord saw it that this
[48:51] peculiar that truth at this time frame
[48:54] where they were it seemed it was failing
[48:58] and those that were departing from Evil
[49:01] it seemed as if though they were making
[49:03] themsel a pray and the Lord saw it
[49:07] sounds a lot like to they we're living
[49:08] doesn't it and it displeased him that
[49:12] there was no judgment and he saw that
[49:16] there was no man and wondered that there
[49:21] was no
[49:22] intercessor therefore his arm brought
[49:26] salvation unto him and his righteousness
[49:31] it sustained him for he put on
[49:34] righteousness as a breastplate and en
[49:38] helmet of salvation upon his head and
[49:41] put on the garments of Vengeance for
[49:45] clothing and was clad with Zeal as a
[49:50] cloak according to their deeds
[49:53] accordingly he will repay Fury to his
[49:57] adversaries recompense to his enemies to
[50:01] the islands he will repay recompense now
[50:04] this is the verse we want to take from
[50:06] tonight so shall they fear the name of
[50:09] the Lord from the West and his glory
[50:14] from the rising of the sun when the
[50:17] enemy shall come in like a flood the
[50:22] spirit of the Lord shall lift up a
[50:26] standard
[50:28] a
[50:29] standard against him may the Lord bless
[50:32] his words you may be
[50:37] seated thank
[50:40] you I'd like to speak to you for just a
[50:43] little a little short time tonight on
[50:46] the standard of the
[50:49] Lord I'm sure that most of you know what
[50:53] a standard is we don't use them as much
[50:56] of of course in our day as they did
[50:59] whenever it was written in the Old
[51:00] Testament but we see enough of them to
[51:03] be able to know that it is an
[51:06] identification so if you're in the Army
[51:10] in the Marines in the Navy whatever you
[51:12] are you have a certain Banner a certain
[51:17] identification a standard is something
[51:20] that helps us gives us a rallying point
[51:24] that we can be able to know uh where to
[51:27] go where we are assigned to it is our
[51:31] identification status now God has always
[51:35] had that and if God has a standard then
[51:39] we know that Satan's goal will be to try
[51:43] to confuse the people of God for that
[51:46] day to where they're not certain where
[51:48] their standard is now because we're not
[51:51] a denomination if we would um list
[51:54] denominational names tonight and values
[51:57] of those people and we're not here now
[51:59] to you know to discredit anyone for
[52:02] wherever they're walking and what God
[52:04] has given them but for many of them they
[52:07] would declare a certain name and you'd
[52:09] say oh yes that that's me that that's
[52:11] what I am I'm of this certain name well
[52:14] that becomes a standard as it was for
[52:17] those people and then they rally around
[52:20] that and whatever that standard declares
[52:23] by their board of directors or their
[52:25] trustees or their people on their system
[52:28] then they get together and they say Well
[52:30] since we are this certain certain group
[52:33] this is what we believe this is our
[52:35] Declaration of faith we believe in God
[52:37] Almighty we believe in this and that and
[52:40] the other then their people they will
[52:42] rally around that that will become the
[52:45] standard by which they gather themselves
[52:48] then other people say well no no no I I
[52:50] don't want to be a part of that because
[52:52] I I believe you know you got to be
[52:54] baptized and that they simply believe in
[52:56] sprinkling so they declare their
[52:58] Declaration of what their standard is
[53:01] and we realize that Satan does this to
[53:05] be to bring confusion upon the people
[53:08] now I love the way that Isaiah when he
[53:10] wrote this by the inspiration of the
[53:12] spirit of God and he said whenever the
[53:14] enemy shall come in like a flood that
[53:18] the spirit of the Lord shall lift up a
[53:21] standard against him now you know
[53:24] according we've just come through a
[53:26] terrible terrible time and this uh
[53:29] hurricane that come up through and
[53:31] wasn't even sure if it's was going to be
[53:32] able to have this Camp because of the
[53:36] effect of it now I didn't see so much on
[53:39] my journey here today uh once I reached
[53:42] this part of that of the flooding but
[53:44] what I saw more so here was trees but
[53:47] our church is about 10 miles from where
[53:50] we had massive catastrophic flooding it
[53:53] was a Thousand-Year flood and it was
[53:56] about about 10 miles from our church and
[53:59] uh bridge is washed away the Interstate
[54:01] closed down hous is washed away some of
[54:04] the people from our church stood at the
[54:06] place where they worked and they saw
[54:08] houses washing down the river they saw
[54:11] churches washing down the river people
[54:14] cars animals uh everything that you can
[54:17] imagine and Carol and I my wife came
[54:20] through uh the a little detour on the
[54:23] interstate today and whenever we cross
[54:25] that place
[54:26] and we saw what had happened it was
[54:29] absolutely unimaginable a catastrophic
[54:33] Flood now you know a flood it's strange
[54:37] because a flood can come in many ways
[54:41] sometimes a flood can be a catastrophic
[54:44] flood as the one that came through Helen
[54:48] now what made it so bad for East
[54:50] Tennessee and Western North Carolina was
[54:53] because it had been many days of of
[54:55] pretty heavy rain and then whenever the
[54:59] flood itself came with the wind and all
[55:02] of that and all the inches and inches of
[55:05] rain then it brought more flooding on
[55:08] top of the wet ground now what had
[55:10] already happened was the inches and
[55:13] inches of rain that had fallen in
[55:16] Western North Carolina and in East
[55:18] Tennessee it caused the ground the
[55:20] mountains to begin to loosen up and then
[55:23] whenever more rain was brought by helim
[55:27] then what it did was it caused
[55:29] tremendous landslides and then trees
[55:32] start falling off of the mountains and
[55:34] sliding down and it's it's absolutely un
[55:39] unfathomable the amount of trees and the
[55:42] amount of debris and the Mount of of
[55:45] great big gigantic M Boulders that are
[55:47] half as big as this building where we
[55:50] are tonight that have been displaced by
[55:53] the power of water but now I want you to
[55:56] think that all floods don't come the way
[56:00] that Helen did you see sometimes floods
[56:03] are brought about by just moderate
[56:06] rainfall that will come day after day
[56:09] after day and it's not a deou of rain
[56:13] it's not something to where you're
[56:15] getting a warning from your National
[56:17] Weather Service and your phone goes off
[56:20] okay we're expecting about seven Ines of
[56:22] rain today and maybe another five and a
[56:25] few more days but it's just moderate
[56:27] rain and it just comes down and you know
[56:29] it's not really that scary it's not that
[56:32] frightening and it happens one day and
[56:34] then another day and then another day
[56:37] and another day it's all moderate rain
[56:40] and then all of a sudden this this
[56:42] pressure will move in and the system
[56:45] will begin to form and it's called by
[56:47] this trough which is in the sky and this
[56:50] trough will just get enough moisture
[56:53] from the Gulf or from the West as it's
[56:55] moving across here and it will just
[56:58] become a deluge now you know I myself I
[57:01] see that as a parallel to where that
[57:04] that's the way life is that sometimes
[57:07] it's not like that we get these heavy
[57:10] deuses in our life but it might be a
[57:13] moderate trial with another moderate
[57:16] trial and another moderate trial and
[57:19] then we find ourselves in a dilemma and
[57:22] what is it it's still a flood
[57:24] nonetheless
[57:26] now no doubt most of you if you've been
[57:28] serving the lord very long you've had
[57:30] floods as it was with helim to where
[57:33] that it seemed like you were overwhelmed
[57:36] so suddenly and it caught you unawares
[57:40] now for those of you that have seen
[57:42] YouTube videos and and one of the towns
[57:44] there near where we live in Johnson City
[57:47] was called Irwin and uh it was a great
[57:50] river that came down through there many
[57:51] years ago uh the core of engineers came
[57:54] behind uh where the hospital was and
[57:57] they built a great restraint they felt
[58:00] like that would be able to hold it in
[58:02] case a flood came but what the water did
[58:05] was the river in the middle of this
[58:08] flood actually changed its course so the
[58:12] core of engineers prepared this so that
[58:16] the river would run its course and it
[58:18] would be behind this certain Hospital
[58:21] which is unicy county hospital one of
[58:23] the sisters in our church a Deacon's
[58:25] wife wife was the administrator of that
[58:28] hospital so she was in Johnson City when
[58:31] she gets this alarm this notice that the
[58:35] river has changed its course and instead
[58:37] of going behind the hospital it's coming
[58:40] in front of the hospital so instead of
[58:43] running for safety this sister goes back
[58:46] to the hospital in the face of danger
[58:50] why she's an administrator it's her
[58:53] responsibility so the water is ing
[58:57] they're taking the patience out for
[58:59] those who know who could not climb on
[59:02] the top of the roof they put them
[59:06] in hospital and they were rising and
[59:10] rising and Rising this sister call my
[59:12] wife and I on the phone she's on the
[59:15] roof of this Hospital cars are passing
[59:18] by she saw her car going by she saw
[59:21] buildings going by different things
[59:23] going by her some of the EMT people are
[59:26] up there the sheriff is up there with
[59:27] them and they cannot get a helicopter in
[59:30] there because the winds hurricane is
[59:32] still blowing trees are going down
[59:35] through there she calls her husband and
[59:38] tells him
[59:42] goodbye and she wanted to hear my voice
[59:46] and my wife Carol's
[59:48] voice thinking it might be the last time
[59:52] she'll ever hear
[59:54] it I can't imagine the human Fear Can
[59:57] you now if you've seen any of these
[1:00:00] videos there's a lot of them on YouTube
[1:00:02] and there's a Blackhawk helicopter that
[1:00:05] comes
[1:00:07] in and picks her
[1:00:11] up she's the last one on the
[1:00:16] roof well let me tell you
[1:00:20] something maybe you feel that way
[1:00:24] tonight you've been under such stress
[1:00:26] and strain in your family and your home
[1:00:31] maybe your church is having all kinds of
[1:00:34] issues and you're not sure that you're
[1:00:37] going to pull through this
[1:00:40] one I'm not here tonight to tell you to
[1:00:43] look for a Blackhawk
[1:00:46] helicopter but I'm here tonight to tell
[1:00:48] you the Lord Jesus has come in these
[1:00:54] meetings not with the Blackhawk
[1:00:56] helicopter but on the wings of an
[1:01:00] eagle
[1:01:02] hallelujah
[1:01:09] hallelujah we begin to pray brother Joe
[1:01:12] Hara he's the brother that was his wife
[1:01:14] there and he's a minister from the
[1:01:15] church and also a deacon and he text
[1:01:18] Brother Daryl and myself and a couple of
[1:01:20] more ministers and said please pray I
[1:01:22] feel so helpless I can't do a thing they
[1:01:25] had all kinds of boats and things that
[1:01:27] was there but they couldn't get to them
[1:01:30] because the water was Rising so fast and
[1:01:34] it got was just in a few feet of the
[1:01:36] boundary of the roof line when the
[1:01:39] sister called Carol and I and she said
[1:01:42] please pray please pray we got patience
[1:01:44] in boats we've got patience up on the
[1:01:47] top of the roof and it don't look like
[1:01:49] they're going to be able to save us
[1:01:52] please
[1:01:53] pray so we begin to pray
[1:01:57] and our God and his power caused that
[1:02:00] wind to calm down around that
[1:02:04] hospital and they begin to send in one
[1:02:07] helicopter after another and be able to
[1:02:09] bring out those people let me tell you
[1:02:11] something that same God that calmed that
[1:02:14] wind so they could be able to make an
[1:02:16] emergency landing is right here in this
[1:02:19] building tonight to be able to drop down
[1:02:23] whatever you have need of in your
[1:02:27] life we know that floods can be so I
[1:02:31] I've been our our church has been
[1:02:34] helping a lot of these things and the
[1:02:36] way it happened to us it's it's just
[1:02:38] phenomenal one of the brothers in our
[1:02:40] church got a phone call from someone who
[1:02:42] worked with over in Weaverville North of
[1:02:44] Asheville and he was blocked in by trees
[1:02:47] and couldn't get out he said could you
[1:02:48] come maybe and bring a friend and bring
[1:02:50] a chainsaw and help get us out we have
[1:02:52] no power no water so they left our
[1:02:54] Church Fellowship Paul maybe four or
[1:02:57] five bags of groceries couple of
[1:02:58] chainsaws gas whatever and then the next
[1:03:01] day some more begin to cry and some more
[1:03:03] begin to
[1:03:04] cry we have fixed over 1,300 meals our
[1:03:09] sisters
[1:03:11] did tens of thousands of dollars have
[1:03:15] been sent to us from people all over the
[1:03:18] United States people from 13 states have
[1:03:23] drove tractors trailers you Halls all
[1:03:27] types of things why because it touched
[1:03:30] their heart the flood victims lost
[1:03:34] everything I've been on some of those
[1:03:36] deliveries myself and see how
[1:03:39] devastating as is and as I looked in
[1:03:41] those mountains and I told my wife when
[1:03:43] I come home I said what I saw today
[1:03:46] those scars of those what the damage
[1:03:49] that was done in those mountains and in
[1:03:52] the rivers and so on will be there until
[1:03:55] the breaking of the day of the
[1:03:59] Millennium it will never recover In Our
[1:04:03] Lifetime trees that were a hundred years
[1:04:06] old some of them even older than that
[1:04:09] broke like
[1:04:11] toothpicks homes displaced lives
[1:04:14] displaced but I look
[1:04:16] tonight and I look at
[1:04:18] humanity and I wonder how many people's
[1:04:21] lives look way worse than the mountains
[1:04:24] that I've seen
[1:04:27] these poor people and you take them
[1:04:29] water and you take them food and
[1:04:31] Pringles and Cheerios they don't have a
[1:04:33] toothbrush they don't have a comb to
[1:04:36] comb their hair it's getting cold in the
[1:04:39] mountains they don't have a
[1:04:44] coat but I think tonight maybe some of
[1:04:46] you you've come to this meeting and you
[1:04:49] thought I'm not sure if it's even for me
[1:04:53] I don't know if I can get anything or
[1:04:55] not
[1:04:56] I believe you
[1:04:58] can
[1:05:01] Hallelujah brother Andrew and myself
[1:05:04] come tonight to be a part of the relief
[1:05:08] disaster
[1:05:10] team praise the
[1:05:12] Lord
[1:05:15] hallelujah
[1:05:17] amen whenever the enemy comes in it's
[1:05:21] like he comes in a way that we're not
[1:05:24] quite prepared
[1:05:26] there's no way that the people who would
[1:05:31] have lost everything would have ever
[1:05:34] stayed the sister in our church no doubt
[1:05:37] if she could have went back and
[1:05:38] rethought she' probably saying what am I
[1:05:41] doing why why would I even do that but
[1:05:44] it was a pulsation of the moment because
[1:05:47] she loved her patience and she couldn't
[1:05:50] stand to see them that were invalid and
[1:05:53] even after she got back back and
[1:05:56] and was safe and rescued herself even
[1:05:59] that afternoon and that night and the
[1:06:01] next day she was calling and checking on
[1:06:04] those patients also another brother from
[1:06:06] our church was also on top of that you
[1:06:09] know why because they don't do it for a
[1:06:11] salary they do it because they're called
[1:06:14] to do it and let me just tell you the
[1:06:16] reason that brother Jason and their
[1:06:18] church and all the those that have
[1:06:20] worked behind the scenes why they do
[1:06:22] that they don't do this so they can get
[1:06:24] a name so people can say well praise God
[1:06:27] brother Jason Watkins and brother Jason
[1:06:29] dear oh my those guys are great guys
[1:06:32] they're not doing it for that more than
[1:06:34] likely they don't even care if you
[1:06:35] remember their first middle or last name
[1:06:38] as long as your life gets changed that's
[1:06:41] the most important thing to them and
[1:06:44] they do it because they love you and
[1:06:46] they pray and ask God about the ministry
[1:06:49] to get in here brother Andrew and myself
[1:06:51] we not here for any other reason it's
[1:06:53] it's really difficult for me to leave
[1:06:56] because my daughter and all that my my
[1:06:58] granddaughter's been you know at home
[1:07:00] and so on and we've got all this
[1:07:02] disaster stuff we've turned our
[1:07:03] fellowship hall into a place I mean it's
[1:07:06] absolutely unbelievable it looks like a
[1:07:08] miniature of Walmart we've got Pringles
[1:07:11] you need anything we got it pretty much
[1:07:12] anything you need we've got it there
[1:07:14] more supplies coming in and seven more
[1:07:17] truckloads going out today generators
[1:07:20] gasoline propane some of these peoples
[1:07:22] have no heaters we bought 500 from
[1:07:25] Walmart walart waiting for them to come
[1:07:27] we bought them from True Value Hardware
[1:07:29] coming from absolutely everywhere it's a
[1:07:32] miracle what it has done to our church
[1:07:35] it has brought our church together you
[1:07:37] know what we couldn't have done it I
[1:07:39] I've come in on Saturday and saw how it
[1:07:41] was all operating and I told the church
[1:07:44] on Sunday I se after I saw how this was
[1:07:47] working I come to this conclusion you
[1:07:49] all don't even need me no more I'm
[1:07:51] retiring
[1:07:55] I
[1:07:56] wish but you know what God calls us and
[1:08:00] he may work on us for years to get us
[1:08:03] ready for such a time as this and let me
[1:08:07] encourage you tonight young man young
[1:08:09] woman let me just give you a little
[1:08:11] insight or you say well I've got plenty
[1:08:13] of years to be able to you know just not
[1:08:15] really give that commitment to God you
[1:08:18] don't even know that at all I'm a 68
[1:08:21] year old man and I gave my heart to the
[1:08:23] Lord Jesus when I was 12 I started

[1:08:28] 18 50 years of my
[1:08:33] life ask me tonight anybody want to do I

[1:08:52] 16 we turned 17 on July the 9th I'm not
[1:08:57] telling you to do
[1:09:02] that and we've been together all these
[1:09:04] years and we still love one another
[1:09:07] thank the Lord for that I'm so grateful
[1:09:09] for
[1:09:12] it I do not regret giving God my 10

[1:09:24] 60s and if he terries and I'm alive I'm

[1:09:31] my 90s if I'm alive don't you think well
[1:09:34] I I've got a lot to do I'll tell you
[1:09:36] what you've got to do you need to read
[1:09:38] your Bible you need to listen to the
[1:09:40] message of the hour you need to go to
[1:09:43] youth meetings and not only that but get
[1:09:45] your soul set on fire by the Holy Ghost
[1:09:49] and when you come back from those youth
[1:09:51] meetings or you say my church needs a
[1:09:53] Revival who knows might start with you
[1:09:57] or with you or with you it might be
[1:10:00] through you that God will so germatize
[1:10:03] that seed of God and it will bring it
[1:10:06] back and start a Revival in your church
[1:10:09] why give the devil your teens why give
[1:10:11] the devil your 20s why give the devil
[1:10:14] your 30s start tonight giving the Lord
[1:10:17] Jesus everything you are and when the
[1:10:21] Devil Comes against you like a flood the
[1:10:24] spirit of God God will raise up a
[1:10:31] standard several years ago my wife and I
[1:10:34] were able to go to Israel it was our
[1:10:37] second trip there and brother Mike walls
[1:10:41] had got the trip together and it was a
[1:10:43] quite quite a busy time in tourism for
[1:10:47] Israel so You' see one tour guide and
[1:10:50] then you'd see another and there'd be
[1:10:51] buses everywhere you would pull up so
[1:10:54] our tour what I noticed was that for
[1:10:57] those T gods they would have a small
[1:11:02] flag now whenever you're on your own bus
[1:11:05] and you're kind of in your own hotel you
[1:11:07] can identify okay I'm with that guy and
[1:11:09] that guy and that guy but when you take
[1:11:11] thousands of people and you're walking
[1:11:13] down the streets of
[1:11:16] Jerusalem it's amazing how the they just
[1:11:19] all merged
[1:11:20] together but I thought it was really
[1:11:23] amazing because you hold up that flag
[1:11:27] and then you know you're with the right
[1:11:31] group now what was that flag a
[1:11:35] standard now you what the devil
[1:11:38] understands that too that's why he's
[1:11:40] doing all that he's doing with the
[1:11:43] transgender move and the gay move and
[1:11:46] the lesbian move now come on don't get
[1:11:48] quiet on me on this that's why he's
[1:11:50] trying to influence our youth and try to
[1:11:54] sew a question in their mind if they're
[1:11:56] a boy or a
[1:11:58] girl well Hallelujah so they don't know
[1:12:02] so what does our government want to do
[1:12:04] they want to be able to take our tax
[1:12:06] dollars and be able to change them out
[1:12:09] oh if you were born a boy I don't figure
[1:12:11] God made no mistake if you were born a
[1:12:14] girl that shouldn't take a scientific
[1:12:16] research all you got do is open your
[1:12:18] eyes and look and you should know
[1:12:20] whether you're a boy or a girl but the
[1:12:22] devil wants to seow them seeds and the
[1:12:24] minds of what use start them when
[1:12:27] they're young started infiltrating their
[1:12:29] minds what is it the enemy's coming in
[1:12:32] like a flood remember it was sex in the
[1:12:35] Garden of Eden that started this fall it
[1:12:37] ain't no wonder that he's on a rampage
[1:12:40] right now like never before but young
[1:12:42] people there's going to be young men and
[1:12:45] young women that's going to overcome the
[1:12:47] absolutely Gates of Hell in this day our
[1:12:51] nation is under a delude of sexual
[1:12:55] perversion our nation is under a delude
[1:12:58] of sexual all mind not only that but
[1:13:01] religious perversion but God has held up
[1:13:04] a standard in the last day what is it a
[1:13:08] rallying point a message of Malachi for
[1:13:12] Hallelujah it is the evening life in
[1:13:15] order to give us a place that we can
[1:13:18] rally
[1:13:22] around now what's amazing is when and
[1:13:25] you're a tourist and you've got a GoPro
[1:13:28] and you've got your iPhone and you've
[1:13:30] got your Nikon and you're taking
[1:13:32] pictures and all of that you know these
[1:13:34] is all the sites you've read about all
[1:13:36] your life and then you're standing there
[1:13:38] and it's so easy to get caught up and
[1:13:40] boy you're teaching this picture and
[1:13:41] that picture and that picture and then
[1:13:44] you look around and you think oh my
[1:13:47] goodness where am
[1:13:49] I what happened to my
[1:13:51] wife what happened to M where am I where
[1:13:54] am I
[1:13:55] so then is when you
[1:13:58] panic so you start looking at this
[1:14:01] flag standard Church preacher whatever
[1:14:06] you want to call it and no that's not it
[1:14:09] that's the wrong color well you look
[1:14:11] over there oh this guy's got one he's
[1:14:13] waving like that and it's oh no no wa
[1:14:15] that's not it either so what are you
[1:14:17] looking for you're looking for your
[1:14:20] standard you see our Jewish tour guide
[1:14:25] was a Massad
[1:14:30] agent now you see some of you don't know
[1:14:32] what Massad it means he does that's why
[1:14:34] I said what he
[1:14:36] did one of Israel's most elite Secret
[1:14:40] Service as a matter of fact when we were
[1:14:42] in the Dead Sea some of the Mad slipped
[1:14:45] into Iran broke into some of their main
[1:14:48] offices broke open their safe and stole
[1:14:51] some of their top secret documents so we
[1:14:55] had to be delayed at the Dead Sea
[1:14:57] because they had to cue him in and let
[1:15:00] him know what had happened now for us of
[1:15:03] course well was glad they done it I
[1:15:05] guess they figured they deemed they
[1:15:06] needed all that but to him he was
[1:15:09] absolutely elated why because that's his
[1:15:13] identity he's a Jew so you and I don't
[1:15:16] think on it on the same way and we
[1:15:18] realize that for many people in the age
[1:15:21] that we're living you know darkness is
[1:15:23] normal to the average person they live
[1:15:26] in darkness they're born in darkness
[1:15:28] they work in darkness they go to school
[1:15:30] in darkness they are not terrified of
[1:15:33] Darkness the way we are and when God
[1:15:36] called pastors see anyone in their
[1:15:39] Church heading toward Darkness it turns
[1:15:41] them all to pieces why because darkness
[1:15:44] is not our element of normaly we do not
[1:15:48] love Darkness we hate Darkness we hate
[1:15:52] sin then what does a pastor try to do he
[1:15:55] tries to raise up that standard before
[1:15:58] you and say don't go that way don't go
[1:16:01] that way no no
[1:16:05] no because he's trying to be mean
[1:16:09] because he loves
[1:16:11] you
[1:16:13] because he loves you you know floods can
[1:16:17] be
[1:16:18] spiritually it can be a flood of
[1:16:21] error so it's just like the flood gates
[1:16:24] just
[1:16:25] pour in around the truths that we have
[1:16:29] one after another after another after
[1:16:31] another it can be a flood of
[1:16:34] error it can also be a flood of
[1:16:38] complacency to where we go to church and
[1:16:40] we clap our hands and we sing and we get
[1:16:43] into the routine and the ritual and
[1:16:46] we're a pretty good believer and you
[1:16:48] know we're not really doing a whole lot
[1:16:49] wrong but we're
[1:16:52] complacent and moderate complacency te
[1:16:55] just keeps adding and adding and adding
[1:16:57] and before long we're
[1:16:59] flooded but we don't even realize it
[1:17:03] it's washed our joy

[1:22:18] kind of worldly pleasure he needed
[1:22:20] something to speak to his soul the devil
[1:22:23] was coming in like a a flood and the
[1:22:25] devil was absolutely flooding his mind
[1:22:29] with these suicide thoughts I don't want
[1:22:30] to live no more I can't do it no more no
[1:22:33] devil I ain't getting off this I'm
[1:22:35] staying on it till the Holy Ghost
[1:22:37] release me I'm here to tell you tonight
[1:22:39] young man you got everything to live for
[1:22:42] young girl but Brother Don you don't
[1:22:44] know what I've been through I don't need
[1:22:46] to know what you've been through but
[1:22:48] what I need to tell you is there's a God
[1:22:50] who loves you there is a God who's come
[1:22:53] Amen in these meetings to bring
[1:22:55] Deliverance to you but I messed up so
[1:22:58] bad but our God is a god of Second
[1:23:02] Chances and third chances and fourth
[1:23:06] chances the question is will you take
[1:23:09] him up on the
[1:23:15] chance oh
[1:23:18] God sometimes it's a
[1:23:21] flood oh Lord Jesus help me of
[1:23:26] neutrality just being
[1:23:28] neutral added to your
[1:23:31] indifference with a color of moderation
[1:23:34] of course not anything to just really
[1:23:38] scare you and frighten you just to get
[1:23:41] you to
[1:23:43] compromise sometimes it can be a
[1:23:45] flood of great
[1:23:48] sorrow and
[1:23:50] sadness you remember when the
[1:23:53] Lord allowed brother Ram's first wife
[1:23:55] and his baby to go
[1:23:57] home brother renam got to such
[1:24:00] despair he tried to take his own
[1:24:06] life I'm so grateful that God stopped
[1:24:09] him where would we be
[1:24:13] tonight you say how could a person do
[1:24:17] that well I to be honest with you I've
[1:24:19] never been there myself but I've talked
[1:24:21] to a lot of people who have
[1:24:25] and for me to say that I understand it I
[1:24:28] don't I don't understand it I hope I
[1:24:29] never go through it but apparently is so
[1:24:33] much upon them that they just have no
[1:24:37] more hope left knowing God made us he
[1:24:41] made us a dimensional
[1:24:44] creature and in in the in the beginning
[1:24:47] we should have
[1:24:50] been
[1:24:52] sieging soul
[1:24:55] and
[1:24:55] body not Spirit remember the prophet
[1:24:59] said your spirit breaks up when you die
[1:25:01] now what's in our spirit imagination
[1:25:04] conscience memory reason and affection
[1:25:08] your spirit is the communication channel
[1:25:11] of your whole being remember the woman
[1:25:14] at the whale and the prophet said that
[1:25:16] the Lord
[1:25:17] Jesus called her spirit you ever notice
[1:25:21] in the discernment when brother random
[1:25:23] would do that that he he would not say
[1:25:25] now I I'm waiting to catch your spirit
[1:25:28] I've never found where he ever said I'm
[1:25:29] waiting to catch your flesh or I'm
[1:25:32] waiting to catch your
[1:25:33] soul and whenever he would catch their
[1:25:36] Spirit then the mystery of their life
[1:25:39] would become unfolded let's look at us
[1:25:41] some of them just from memory off the
[1:25:42] top of my head I see you coming home
[1:25:46] from school you've got a yellow check a
[1:25:49] dress on there's a dog chasing you you
[1:25:52] run up on the porch
[1:25:54] and you fall through the door and it
[1:25:57] scared you the rest of your
[1:26:01] life now you imagine this
[1:26:04] woman now many years older than that
[1:26:07] comes up before the prophet and when she
[1:26:09] does he doesn't tell her how long her
[1:26:11] hair is how decent her dress is how many
[1:26:14] times she reads the Bible every day how
[1:26:16] many times she prays but he goes to her
[1:26:19] troubled
[1:26:21] area not her soul not even her body
[1:26:25] but the communication channel of this
[1:26:27] woman opened up and he began to
[1:26:30] communicate where her problems
[1:26:33] lay let's let's hear another one so I
[1:26:38] see that you have a
[1:26:41] fear a fear of winter
[1:26:45] time a phobia of winter time every time
[1:26:50] it goes to getting
[1:26:52] winter you get a
[1:26:54] fear and it's caused you to be with bad
[1:27:02] constipation how peculiar is
[1:27:05] that now you imagine this poor
[1:27:07] individual trying to eat fiber and
[1:27:10] apples and
[1:27:12] prunes and everything in the world to
[1:27:14] relieve their problem but the problem
[1:27:18] was not
[1:27:19] physical the problem laid in the Avenue
[1:27:23] of a fear or a phobia but it reflected
[1:27:27] itself in the
[1:27:30] body why now the communication channel
[1:27:33] of course I'm not a prophet no other
[1:27:34] prophets here on the Earth today but I
[1:27:36] believe the Holy Ghost can still be able
[1:27:39] to discern Our Hearts by the preaching
[1:27:42] of the word of
[1:27:43] God maybe there's young people here
[1:27:45] tonight that's been through terrible
[1:27:47] terrible things in your life and you've
[1:27:50] come here to this meeting bearing scars
[1:27:52] and maybe you're not even sh that you
[1:27:54] even trust me or brother Andrew or
[1:27:57] brother Jason or any other preacher as
[1:27:58] far as that goes because you've been so
[1:28:01] hurt by preachers you've been so let
[1:28:04] down and so disappointed maybe even by
[1:28:07] your parents or your grandparents or
[1:28:09] maybe a a pastor in your life but let me
[1:28:11] tell you something the failures of human
[1:28:13] beings has nothing to do with the
[1:28:15] reality and the power and the
[1:28:18] faithfulness of almighty God so don't
[1:28:21] you blame God for the failures of
[1:28:23] preachers or anybody else come on now is
[1:28:26] that right now sure we all get hurt I've
[1:28:28] been hurt too I've been so hurt by
[1:28:30] preachers my goodness but you know what
[1:28:32] I refuse to let that stop me because
[1:28:36] that has nothing to do with my God so
[1:28:39] what do we want to do we want to bring
[1:28:41] ourselves before the Lord and let the
[1:28:44] Lord be able to look down every Avenue
[1:28:47] of our life and say Lord am I carrying
[1:28:50] fears and complexes and phobias oh it's
[1:28:53] unbelievable the amount of phobias that
[1:28:55] they've diagnosed in this day you've
[1:28:57] probably read of a lot of them some
[1:28:58] people have a fear of red some people
[1:29:01] have a fear of blue some people have a
[1:29:03] fear of yellow some people have a fear
[1:29:05] of broccoli I don't fear it but I sure
[1:29:08] don't like it some people have got a
[1:29:09] fear of flying some people have got a
[1:29:12] fear of big crowds it's unbelievable how
[1:29:15] many fears they've diagnosed call them
[1:29:17] whatever you want to call them it ain't
[1:29:19] nothing but a devil I said it ain't
[1:29:21] nothing but a devil some of you may be
[1:29:24] the one of the greatest fears is the
[1:29:26] fear of failure well I want to be a
[1:29:29] Christian but I'm afraid I'll fall I'm
[1:29:31] afraid I'll fall short oh sure you're
[1:29:33] going to fall short but the thing of it
[1:29:35] is you get right back up and dust
[1:29:37] yourself off and say Lord I am so sorry
[1:29:41] I am going to get the best of this thing
[1:29:44] this besetting sin in my life is not
[1:29:47] going to destroy me by the grace of God
[1:29:52] [Applause]
[1:29:58] I guess some of the saddest things that
[1:29:59] I've seen in the last few
[1:30:03] weeks due to catastrophic winds and
[1:30:08] floods is how
[1:30:10] floods
[1:30:13] destroys such valuable
[1:30:17] things some of them folks that we've
[1:30:19] been helping they're waiting on their
[1:30:21] life insurance they told me the other
[1:30:23] day if we would have been waiting on
[1:30:25] FEMA we'd been dead but God sent you all
[1:30:29] to
[1:30:30] us now we know FEMA's got their hands
[1:30:32] full we understand that but you realize
[1:30:35] that what floods do they can rebuild
[1:30:38] their houses many of them many of them
[1:30:40] are now finding out they didn't have
[1:30:42] flood
[1:30:44] insurance and their house is gone and
[1:30:46] they're still paying payments on
[1:30:48] it but they have no house to go
[1:30:50] to because they don't have flood
[1:30:54] insurance I'm so glad my eternal life
[1:30:57] policy has flood
[1:31:01] insurance my God knew there'd be things
[1:31:03] come against me that I wouldn't know
[1:31:05] what to do anybody ever been there every
[1:31:08] anybody ever been to that spot that you
[1:31:10] didn't know what to do you didn't know
[1:31:12] how you was going to get through it but
[1:31:13] boy I'm so glad the Holy Ghost has got
[1:31:16] flood insurance and when the enemy comes
[1:31:18] in like the flood the spirit of the Lord
[1:31:20] lifts up a standard what's it for it's
[1:31:23] so let let you know where to Rally
[1:31:25] around but the devil will do everything
[1:31:28] he can young people when you get down
[1:31:30] and you get despondent one the first
[1:31:32] things he'll do is to cause you to pull
[1:31:34] away from your church cause you to pull
[1:31:37] away from your family and for those that
[1:31:39] can help you recognize that as the devil
[1:31:42] don't you pull away from your family
[1:31:44] that loves you don't you pull away from
[1:31:47] your church family they love you and
[1:31:49] they are there to help you don't you let
[1:31:51] that devil lie to you and say they don't
[1:31:54] love you they do love
[1:32:00] you one of the brothers today that went
[1:32:03] out on a a mission to take some of that
[1:32:06] stuff sent me a picture an hour or so
[1:32:09] before we come to church of plaques they
[1:32:12] found Bibles and found all kinds of
[1:32:15] things somebody sent me a picture not
[1:32:16] long ago of where that they had found a
[1:32:19] Bible turned open to the scripture I
[1:32:22] read tonight when the enemy shall come
[1:32:25] in like a
[1:32:28] flood they might be able to replace
[1:32:30] their car their
[1:32:33] clothes but what about photographs of
[1:32:36] their mother their
[1:32:39] grandmother
[1:32:41] weddings baby
[1:32:43] dedications you see what floods do
[1:32:46] floods try to Rob us from some of the
[1:32:48] most spiritual intimacy that we have
[1:32:52] with our lord Jesus
[1:32:54] and with brothers and
[1:32:56] sisters knock us out of
[1:32:59] Fellowship oh my hope somebody's sharing
[1:33:02] me tonight I want you to notice how
[1:33:05] Isaiah this word that he chose to use so
[1:33:08] shall they fear the name of the Lord
[1:33:10] from the west from the West which is
[1:33:12] where we're from and His glory from the
[1:33:15] rising of the sun when the enemy shall
[1:33:18] come in like a flood the spirit of the
[1:33:22] Lord shall lift up a standard against
[1:33:25] him now this is the same word that Moses
[1:33:29] used in Genesis in the beginning God
[1:33:32] created the heavens and the Earth and
[1:33:34] the Earth was without form and void and
[1:33:37] darkness covered the face of the deep
[1:33:39] and the spirit of God that Hebrew word
[1:33:44] is
[1:33:45] ruach
[1:33:47] Elohim ruach Elohim look at what it
[1:33:51] means the spirit that breathes quickly
[1:33:55] in
[1:33:57] animation Vigor courage and inspiring a
[1:34:03] static state of
[1:34:07] Prophecy so when the enemy comes in like
[1:34:10] a flood Here Comes god with
[1:34:13] inspiration the spirit ruach I love this
[1:34:17] meaning of this word the compound of it
[1:34:19] is spirit of God which is one of the
[1:34:21] first manifestations of the compound
[1:34:23] name of God Genesis 1 and it is that he
[1:34:26] took his wings and began to brood over
[1:34:30] the
[1:34:31] Earth so he was brooding and
[1:34:41] breathing
[1:34:42] ruach
[1:34:45] Elohim and when the enemy comes in to
[1:34:48] destroy God sends this presence so what
[1:34:52] is the stand Bearer The Spirit of the
[1:34:56] Lord you know I love quotes and I get
[1:34:59] discouraged don't you
[1:35:01] scriptures but I don't mind telling you
[1:35:03] there's been times in my life I needed a
[1:35:06] God that had skin on
[1:35:10] it Ain that right somebody that'll pick
[1:35:14] up a phone and call you text you
[1:35:16] WhatsApp you zoom you and whatever else
[1:35:18] y'all do somebody that God will lay it
[1:35:22] on their hearts
[1:35:25] amen you believe is that mindful of you
[1:35:29] few years ago I was down in my basement
[1:35:31] at home listen to the tape building a
[1:35:33] piece of furniture I like to make
[1:35:35] furniture and a certain man come on my
[1:35:39] heart that man was many many hundreds of
[1:35:42] miles from where I
[1:35:45] live this man had fallen into a terrible
[1:35:48] terrible
[1:35:49] sin and the spirit of God quickened to
[1:35:53] me a quote that I'd heard the prophet
[1:35:55] say about taking your
[1:35:59] life I picked up my phone I text this
[1:36:03] man little did I
[1:36:06] know he had his
[1:36:09] gun stuck to his
[1:36:12] head he had tried to figure out a way to
[1:36:14] make it look like an accident so his
[1:36:16] wife would be able to get his insurance
[1:36:20] claim because another preacher had sent
[1:36:22] him a real real email a message
[1:36:27] preacher basically left him no hope no
[1:36:31] mercy I actually read the email I was
[1:36:33] ashamed to be
[1:36:35] honest so this man is sitting there on a
[1:36:38] stump and his phone goes off and he sees
[1:36:41] it's me I've known him for several
[1:36:44] years he picked up that phone into his
[1:36:46] hand and started reading that what I
[1:36:49] told him I said the spirit of God come
[1:36:50] on him and I was down here in the
[1:36:52] basement I said I'm not sure you know
[1:36:54] where you at well exactly what you're
[1:36:55] going
[1:36:56] through but I'm just going to tell you
[1:36:57] what he told me to tell you that night
[1:37:00] he called me couldn't wait to get back
[1:37:01] to where he could but in phone
[1:37:03] range wow the enemy was coming in like a
[1:37:10] flood and well the sad part about it is
[1:37:13] a message preacher was part of that
[1:37:22] flood don't make Gods out of
[1:37:26] preachers God uses them and they'll help
[1:37:29] you but they're human
[1:37:31] beings I put my ultimate confidence in
[1:37:35] no
[1:37:36] man I got confidence in all these
[1:37:38] brothers sitting here tonight absolutely
[1:37:41] but my ultimate confidence is in one
[1:37:44] right up here because people will let
[1:37:46] you down y'all ever been let down you
[1:37:49] ever been disappointed by people oh yes
[1:37:51] have confidence pray for them but
[1:37:53] remember remember they are human beings
[1:37:56] they will make mistakes they'll fall
[1:37:58] short of the glory of God come on don't
[1:38:00] get quiet on me now I feel like myself
[1:38:02] that's one of the reasons why that God
[1:38:04] allowed brother Brenham to mention some
[1:38:05] of his own human mistakes in the message
[1:38:08] because a lot of message people would
[1:38:09] have never wanted you to read them I
[1:38:12] cannot follow a preacher that will not
[1:38:14] admit that he's a human being and that
[1:38:16] he makes mistakes but I can get behind a
[1:38:19] man that'll say I fell short of the
[1:38:22] glory of God I can get behind a man that
[1:38:24] say church WIll you pray for me I can
[1:38:26] get behind a prophet of God that
[1:38:29] whenever he told his wife to tell that
[1:38:31] liyer that he wasn't in the house and
[1:38:33] whenever they brought the sick baby that
[1:38:35] afternoon for him to pray for the Holy
[1:38:37] Ghost spoke to him and said you're a
[1:38:41] hypocrite wow my I can imagine the Holy
[1:38:44] Ghost saying it but I'd still Marvel
[1:38:46] that I hear a man get up behind the pull
[1:38:48] pit and say what the Holy Ghost told him
[1:38:51] knowing that them tapes should be played
[1:38:53] by five thousands of people that's the
[1:38:56] kind of man you want to put your
[1:38:58] confidence in that's the kind of man why
[1:39:00] he's been through the
[1:39:02] floods
[1:39:07] himself
[1:39:09] oh let me let me
[1:39:12] hurry you know it's so
[1:39:16] sad after God has sent us such a
[1:39:20] wonderful beautiful message
[1:39:23] that in our own ranks standards are
[1:39:27] being lifted up by different preachers
[1:39:30] and
[1:39:31] Ministries that's bringing
[1:39:35] confusion now you young people you may
[1:39:37] go to different camps and you want to be
[1:39:39] there and be a part of it in Fellowship
[1:39:41] no doubt you've experienced that one
[1:39:44] preacher says one thing and another
[1:39:45] preacher says something else and another
[1:39:47] preacher says something else and you
[1:39:48] think what do you believe where do you
[1:39:51] come back to the standard of this
[1:39:56] day notice in Isaiah
[1:40:00] 11:10 in that day there shall be a root
[1:40:02] of
[1:40:03] Jesse which shall stand for an ins sign
[1:40:07] of the people which is the standard to
[1:40:11] it shall the gentille seek and his rest
[1:40:14] shall be glorious verse 12 and he shall
[1:40:17] set up an ins sign for the Nations and
[1:40:19] shall assemble the outcasts of Israel
[1:40:22] and gather together the dispersed of
[1:40:24] Judah from the four quarters of the
[1:40:26] earth so who is our who is our standard
[1:40:30] the Lord Jesus but yet the denominations
[1:40:34] say the same
[1:40:35] thing but the problem with man-made
[1:40:37] religion is that they make their own
[1:40:42] Jesus so the Baptist have a baptist
[1:40:45] version of Jesus every denomination has
[1:40:49] their own version of a Jesus now I don't
[1:40:51] want to say it to hurt you feelings but
[1:40:53] I don't I'm not sure that some of the
[1:40:54] message folks are too far from doing the
[1:40:56] exact same thing because they've got
[1:40:59] their own
[1:41:00] Jesus well Hallelujah a l the
[1:41:02] denomination they've got a Jesus that'll
[1:41:04] let them sin and do whatever they want
[1:41:06] to do and that Jesus will let them come
[1:41:08] right into heaven they can live any way
[1:41:10] they want to live that's not the Jesus
[1:41:13] of the Bible is that right young people
[1:41:16] so what did they do so they hold up a
[1:41:18] standard here with the same name on it
[1:41:22] as ours oh my now those of you that know
[1:41:26] your your your new testament if you've
[1:41:28] studied it very well in the interlineal
[1:41:31] Greek you realize that whenever the
[1:41:34] great offer was made to the Jews that
[1:41:37] day when the Lord Jesus stands
[1:41:40] there and whenever the great man stands
[1:41:44] and makes the
[1:41:46] offer so which will you
[1:41:49] choose I found it amazing several years
[1:41:52] ago as I was studying on this that I
[1:41:55] found that oh Lord help me whenever he
[1:41:59] makes this
[1:42:01] offer do you want
[1:42:03] Jesus the king of the
[1:42:07] Jews but there was another man there
[1:42:10] remember his
[1:42:11] name but what I found amazing was his
[1:42:14] name was not only
[1:42:16] Barabas but it was
[1:42:20] Jesus
[1:42:22] Jesus
[1:42:26] barabus so here's one
[1:42:28] Jesus and here's another
[1:42:36] one oh Lord God help
[1:42:39] us I you're God's Prophet say listen
[1:42:42] little church the church in the last
[1:42:45] days it'll be so close it would deceive
[1:42:48] the very elected if possible it will be
[1:42:52] twins
[1:42:54] it will be a Pentecostal
[1:42:56] move same mother same
[1:43:00] movement but different
[1:43:06] fathers so then what a Catholic
[1:43:11] priest and an Archbishop or something
[1:43:13] like that be a twin to brother
[1:43:16] Jason I me he stands up big toe little
[1:43:20] toe
[1:43:23] and wears a dress you know like a woman
[1:43:25] all that and You' say that's brother
[1:43:26] Jason's
[1:43:30] twin so what would brother Jason's twin
[1:43:36] be someone in the message have to be our
[1:43:39] twin cannot be Church of
[1:43:41] Christ it cannot even be Church of God
[1:43:44] Assembly of God none of that it must be
[1:43:46] I know this hurts us but young people
[1:43:49] you're not idiots you're not idiots I'm
[1:43:52] not here tonight to treat you like a
[1:43:53] bunch of babies I want you to be able to
[1:43:56] embrace the truth and realize no doubt
[1:43:58] many of you have got questions in your
[1:44:00] heart cuz you're hearing this and that
[1:44:01] and the other that it brings confusion
[1:44:03] come back to Christ Jesus the word and
[1:44:07] remember the Holy Ghost will not deny
[1:44:10] one word in his holy
[1:44:15] scriptures so when the enemy comes in
[1:44:17] against
[1:44:19] us you imagine Jesus saying it in
[1:44:22] Matthew 24 4 24 there stand before me
[1:44:24] that day and say Lord I cast out devils
[1:44:28] in your name I heal the sick in your
[1:44:32] name and he'll say I will say unto them
[1:44:34] depart from me you worker of iniquity
[1:44:37] for I never knew you that word knew is
[1:44:41] not
[1:44:42] knowledge but it is the word that is
[1:44:44] used for a relationship between a man
[1:44:46] and a
[1:44:47] woman it is more than knowing about God
[1:44:50] you see to the Jews knowledge the Greek
[1:44:53] word nosis to them it was more than an
[1:44:56] intellectual conception it was knowing
[1:44:59] it and then carrying it out that's the
[1:45:02] way they looked at a real knowledgeable
[1:45:04] person it wasn't just they could quote
[1:45:06] and quote and quote but they lived their
[1:45:10] knowledge oh my that what we want to
[1:45:14] do where are you tonight young
[1:45:17] people where do you find
[1:45:20] yourself are the waters Rising around
[1:45:23] your
[1:45:24] feet that sister that I told you about
[1:45:27] earlier from our
[1:45:29] church her and her husband wanted to
[1:45:31] come into my office a week ago on Sunday
[1:45:34] because she's still dealing with some of
[1:45:36] this stuff she wanted to thank me for
[1:45:39] Carol and I praying for
[1:45:42] her and sharing with me how she
[1:45:47] felt and watching that water rise and
[1:45:49] Rise she said brother Donnie I had to go
[1:45:52] around on the other side of an air
[1:45:54] conditioning unit so them people would
[1:45:57] not hear the fear in my
[1:46:00] voice what's she doing being strong for
[1:46:04] her
[1:46:05] patience oh how many preachers in this
[1:46:08] message stand behind pulpits when they
[1:46:11] themselves have gone down for the first
[1:46:14] count the second count and the third
[1:46:18] count but you see a preacher has to act
[1:46:21] like he's got the victory
[1:46:23] he's got to act like he's happy he's got
[1:46:26] to act like everything is going good
[1:46:28] when it ain't that's why it's so easy
[1:46:30] for preachers to get into real trouble
[1:46:33] and nobody can pick it
[1:46:35] up because you're part preacher part
[1:46:42] actor I wonder how these preachers would
[1:46:44] act how they would behave before you if
[1:46:47] they acted the way they felt all the
[1:46:49] time they'd walk out and say well I was
[1:46:51] going to preach tonight but I'm so think
[1:46:53] and low down and I'll tell you what I
[1:46:54] just don't think I ain't got nothing to
[1:46:55] say y'all go
[1:46:58] home come back tomorrow I'll try again
[1:47:01] tomorrow but I ain't promising you
[1:47:02] nothing now I may not have nothing
[1:47:03] tomorrow either you would say Lord have
[1:47:06] mercy what in the world's wrong with
[1:47:08] brother Jason say what does he do he
[1:47:09] applies himself he studies he look for
[1:47:11] something talk about gets up there glory
[1:47:13] to God I'm telling you we're Victors
[1:47:15] tonight and he himself is fighting the
[1:47:17] offest battle he's ever fought in his
[1:47:19] life I've set in counsel people many
[1:47:22] times people from around the world they
[1:47:24] come from around the world to talk to
[1:47:26] you to get advice and I'm sitting there
[1:47:28] with dealing with more than they are and
[1:47:31] I'm thinking you flew from the UK to
[1:47:33] come here and talk to me about this I
[1:47:35] wish that was my
[1:47:39] problem but what is it each of us have
[1:47:43] floods you're not going to be exempt
[1:47:46] from them but this is the question how
[1:47:49] will you
[1:47:50] deal with it when it comes
[1:47:57] amen let me stop right now is a good
[1:48:00] time let bar
[1:48:11] it
[1:48:13] Hallelujah so I wonder the first night
[1:48:16] of
[1:48:16] these precious times
[1:48:20] together would there be anybody here one
[1:48:22] or many that would raise your hand and
[1:48:25] say I need help I don't want to wait
[1:48:28] till
[1:48:29] Sunday God knows I need help
[1:48:32] tonight maybe you find yourself in over
[1:48:34] your
[1:48:35] head maybe so far it's just up on your
[1:48:38] heels if your shoes or maybe your socks
[1:48:41] are just now getting
[1:48:43] wet but you don't want to wait you say
[1:48:45] Lord why should I head this thing off
[1:48:49] tonight anybody else with ever a head
[1:48:52] bath please please just raise your hand
[1:48:54] to the Lord we're not going to embarrass
[1:48:56] you we're not going to humiliate you
[1:48:58] pull on you or anything like
[1:49:01] that
[1:49:04] amen Lord
[1:49:09] Jesus I believe tonight that
[1:49:12] we are in such a great great
[1:49:17] War Lord as I read today where Israel
[1:49:23] had finally been able to take
[1:49:25] out one of their greatest
[1:49:29] enemies one who has killed many
[1:49:32] thousands of their
[1:49:35] people no doubt in
[1:49:37] Israel many happy
[1:49:40] people are rejoicing because of this one
[1:49:45] man that they were able to take
[1:49:49] out Lord God brother Andrew and myself
[1:49:51] are here this week to
[1:49:53] help every individual that'll attend
[1:49:56] these Services first and foremost our
[1:49:57] priority of course is the youths but
[1:49:59] then the adults that have brought them
[1:50:01] and come with
[1:50:03] them oh Jesus we want to be able to
[1:50:06] leave this campground on Sunday
[1:50:09] afternoon also rejoicing in our
[1:50:13] hearts because an enemy of lust has been
[1:50:17] slain an enemy of
[1:50:20] suicide an enemy of distrust
[1:50:25] Lord maybe there's some here tonight
[1:50:26] that they've just are just not
[1:50:29] sure there maybe some Lord that have
[1:50:31] come and they thought this is my last
[1:50:33] meeting I ain't coming back to another
[1:50:36] one but Lord Jesus may your presence
[1:50:39] sweep down in this place tonight
[1:50:43] father maybe they've went down for the
[1:50:45] first count for the second
[1:50:48] count and they just came because well I
[1:50:52] I'll go I'm not sure I'll get
[1:50:55] anything but may the spirit of God lift
[1:50:57] a standard here these few
[1:51:01] days we know that that day on
[1:51:06] Calvary a standard was lifted like had
[1:51:09] never been lifted
[1:51:13] before when you come to the Earth to
[1:51:15] become one of
[1:51:17] us oh Lord we Marvel that you become a
[1:51:21] sheep but I'm Marvel even greater that
[1:51:23] you become a
[1:51:25] goat cuz your Prophet said you become
[1:51:28] that
[1:51:29] goat and our sins was laid upon
[1:51:32] you and Paul said you who knew no sin
[1:51:35] become the very oh my you become our sin
[1:51:39] that we might become the very
[1:51:41] righteousness of God in him now now hear
[1:51:44] him saying demonology part two paragraph
[1:51:46] 199 I think of how that Jesus when he
[1:51:50] died God sent him to
[1:51:54] hell because of his
[1:51:58] sins but you never said one thing wrong
[1:52:00] or did one thing
[1:52:02] wrong where did you get sins
[1:52:07] mine these young people's sins you took
[1:52:11] them upon
[1:52:13] yourself and you went down into
[1:52:16] hell Hallelujah you died
[1:52:19] alone so when I come to die I won't have
[1:52:24] to when my little girl a year ago
[1:52:27] yesterday
[1:52:29] Lord when she started entering into that
[1:52:33] channel we was all in the room praying
[1:52:36] praying
[1:52:37] praying but it became evident you were
[1:52:41] going to take her I get up from my chair
[1:52:44] open my phone to Psalm
[1:52:47] 23 The Lord is my shepherd I shall not
[1:52:52] want
[1:52:54] I'm so glad Lord Jesus in Good Times in
[1:52:57] shouting times you're there but oh in
[1:53:00] times of flood you're
[1:53:02] there and when death comes we don't have
[1:53:06] to scream like a
[1:53:08] coward glory to God because we will not
[1:53:12] die
[1:53:13] alone and you screamed out on the cross
[1:53:16] the
[1:53:17] standard was on the cross and you said
[1:53:20] Eli Eli
[1:53:22] L May sebasty my God my God

[2:01:18] something friends this world brother
[2:01:20] Donnie spoke about
[2:01:24] the the insanity of the age that we live
[2:01:27] in and it's an unparalleled day you live
[2:01:29] in there's never been a day like it
[2:01:31] there's never been an age where Satan
[2:01:35] become by the by the popular vote he
[2:01:38] becomes the god of the evil age never
[2:01:41] been a day this is an un unparalleled
[2:01:44] time brother Bram shows that that's
[2:01:46] exactly what Paul was showing at the end
[2:01:48] there would be things that happen in the
[2:01:51] day that you live in that only happen in
[2:01:53] the day you live in he's the god of the
[2:01:57] evil age he's now had 6,000 years to
[2:02:01] build his Eden no age has ever had to
[2:02:04] face
[2:02:06] simultaneously the days of Noah and the
[2:02:09] days of lot right
[2:02:11] now
[2:02:13] amen you know the world and all of their
[2:02:15] Insanity I was I was sitting there
[2:02:17] thinking as brother Donnie was talking
[2:02:18] about all the the crazy things that they
[2:02:22] want me to they expect me to change my
[2:02:25] definition of what is a male and a
[2:02:27] female they expect me to adopt their
[2:02:30] woke language and you know something I'm
[2:02:33] not going to do that I I don't intend to
[2:02:37] admit that what they say is true and you
[2:02:39] know what I'm not talking now about
[2:02:41] politics because I'm not a politician
[2:02:43] we're not here brother Donnie's not here
[2:02:45] to make a political speech I'm not you
[2:02:48] know what I'm GNA hold up a standard I'm
[2:02:50] not going to allow
[2:02:52] someone who's not a Christian to be
[2:02:54] called a Christian even right it just
[2:02:57] doesn't matter you might have been in a
[2:02:58] message Church you might believe God
[2:02:59] said I'm Prophet but I'm here to tell
[2:03:01] you it's more than just lip service it's
[2:03:04] a real experience and I'm holding a
[2:03:07] standard to say we will not
[2:03:10] compromise we will not acquest to the
[2:03:13] enemy with we're not backing up we're
[2:03:15] going
[2:03:16] [Music]
[2:03:18] forward Hallelujah
[2:03:22] I think we ought to have a standard to
[2:03:23] say a real believer is a holy ghost
[2:03:26] filled on Fire full of the Zeal of the
[2:03:29] Holy Spirit
[2:03:31] Hallelujah you know this is why I so
[2:03:35] appreciate the promise that Jesus made
[2:03:38] in in John chapter 6 I believe the 39th
[2:03:42] verse of memory
[2:03:43] serves where he says here he says that
[2:03:47] that all the father has given me right
[2:03:52] amen you remember the scripture and
[2:03:55] they'll come and and and and Jesus said
[2:03:58] I lose nothing and it's always stood out
[2:04:01] to me that he didn't say people because
[2:04:04] of course a gene of God cannot be lost
[2:04:08] but friends it's not just because that
[2:04:11] you are a gene of God it's not just
[2:04:13] people that he won't lose he loses
[2:04:16] nothing that means that whatever you
[2:04:19] were supposed to be whatever God
[2:04:21] envisioned I'm here to tell you I don't
[2:04:24] care what's happened to you in your life
[2:04:26] and Satan may have taken it from you and
[2:04:28] you may have had every kind of flood and
[2:04:30] every kind of that the enemy has come
[2:04:33] into your life it might have been a
[2:04:34] preacher it might have been your home it
[2:04:36] might have been a a a boyfriend a
[2:04:38] girlfriend an experience and tonight you
[2:04:41] feel like what has been taken from me
[2:04:43] I'm here to tell you the vision of God
[2:04:46] is Not diminished and the message of the
[2:04:49] hour has come to give it back to you
[2:04:52] it's not just people but it's whatever
[2:04:55] you were supposed to be I'm here to tell
[2:04:57] you you can be that tonight starting
[2:05:00] tonight it doesn't even matter if you
[2:05:02] were involved in the loss Jesus gives it
[2:05:08] back
[2:05:10] [Applause]
[2:05:12] Hallelujah I'm going to tell you
[2:05:13] something friends I hope you'll take my
[2:05:15] word for it the Lord passed in front of
[2:05:17] me and spoke to me directly and I don't
[2:05:20] listen let me tell you I'm just going to
[2:05:21] tell you what he told me a lot of times
[2:05:24] we're preaching to adults and we're
[2:05:26] preaching to parents and we're saying
[2:05:28] you need to you need to raise a standard
[2:05:30] in your home you need to come back to
[2:05:32] the oldfashioned we say that across our
[2:05:34] pull pit but the Lord said to me and I
[2:05:37] don't know it might only be one person
[2:05:39] in here tonight I don't know what's
[2:05:41] going on in your home or what's going on
[2:05:43] in your family but I'm here to tell you
[2:05:46] God might have you to be the standard
[2:05:49] because brother brandham said concerning
[2:05:51] that scripture when an enemy comes in
[2:05:53] like a flood and he raises a standard
[2:05:56] brother brandham says that's you raising
[2:05:58] yourself up in prayer I'm here to tell
[2:06:01] you I don't know what kind of home you
[2:06:03] came from but God might be using you
[2:06:06] tonight to go back home and reverse it
[2:06:09] and say I'm going to influence my
[2:06:12] parents I'm going to influence my
[2:06:15] siblings I'm going to influence my whole
[2:06:19] church Hallelujah and all he's ever
[2:06:22] needed is a surrendered friend a
[2:06:25] surrendered heart tonight and I believe
[2:06:28] that God can restore you back to
[2:06:30] whatever you might have arrived at this
[2:06:33] camp and say I'm missing some pieces I'm
[2:06:35] here to tell you Jesus gives them back
[2:06:38] that's what this word is this message is
[2:06:41] not books and tapes and quotes it's a
[2:06:45] person of Jesus Christ do you believe it
[2:06:49] tonight do you really believe it

[2:07:19] whatever's happened in your church God
[2:07:21] can use use you to be the Catalyst God
