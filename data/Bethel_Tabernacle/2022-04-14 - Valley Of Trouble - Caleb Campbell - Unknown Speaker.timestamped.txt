[42:48] character and he's just ironing ironing
[42:50] out the parts of me that just don't need
[42:52] to be there but there is still a lot
[42:55] that needs to be less like me less like
[42:58] us and more like him amen
[43:00] zechariah 13 9 says that it talks about
[43:03] refining silver and trying gold through
[43:05] the fire
[43:06] now in goldsmithing when you try a fine
[43:09] metal like that you don't just dip it in
[43:10] the fire once and expect all the
[43:12] impurities to be separated out you keep
[43:15] dipping until you see a reflection until
[43:17] there isn't a trace of the imperfections
[43:20] left amen so the trials that we're
[43:22] facing tonight as much as
[43:24] the enemy thinks that he's victorious
[43:26] over us that is just god dipping us in
[43:29] the fire just trying us getting us ready
[43:32] for that soon return amen
[43:34] and it's truly
[43:36] god's mercy
[43:37] trials are
[43:41] preparing us for our eternal destination
[43:43] thanks bro
[43:44] that's how we should focus on our trials
[43:46] and see it as him perfecting us
[43:49] paul speaks of a trial that he was going
[43:51] through to the corinthians church the
[43:54] thorn it was a thorn in a side and the
[43:56] scripture doesn't exactly say what the
[43:58] thorn was probably for good reason that
[44:00] many of us might put ourselves in that
[44:03] in that same situation and not being
[44:05] able to get past it because we would
[44:07] think that only that thing would be what
[44:09] we can conquer and what we would glory
[44:11] in a tribulation amen
[44:13] but when he writes this he had actually
[44:15] already asked the lord three different
[44:17] times to take this thing from him and
[44:19] finally the lord just spoke to him spoke
[44:21] to him and he said that
[44:23] my grace is sufficient for thee
[44:26] for my strength is made perfect
[44:29] in weakness amen glory through it all
[44:32] his grace is sufficient in our
[44:34] weaknesses now ephesians 6 now i'm just
[44:37] building a little bit here ephesians 6
[44:39] speaks of what we're fighting against
[44:41] fighting against the principalities and
[44:42] the powers and the rulers of the
[44:44] darkness of this world amen but
[44:46] scripture doesn't stop there and do must
[44:48] to live subjected
[44:51] to defeat to be defeated by those powers
[44:54] the word arms us with a weapon with the
[44:56] sword of the spirit to not only defend
[44:58] against but to attack and defeat every
[45:01] single time amen
[45:03] colossians 2. i'm just going to build up
[45:05] a little bit here so that we can disarm
[45:07] the enemy a little bit amen colossians 2
[45:09] 15 says he disarmed those principalities
[45:12] he stripped their power he spoiled them
[45:14] and he made a show of them opening
[45:16] openly triumphing over them
[45:19] by nailing every power that the enemy
[45:22] had to the cross amen and not only did
[45:25] he overcome and triumph over them
[45:27] hebrews 2 said in verse 17 18 it says
[45:30] wherefore in all things it behooved him
[45:33] to be made like unto his brother that he
[45:35] might be a merciful and high priest in
[45:38] things pertaining to god to make
[45:41] reconciliation for the sins of the
[45:43] people for the
[45:44] for that in himself hath being tempted
[45:47] he is able to secure
[45:49] all that are tempted that word sakura
[45:51] actually translates and says that it
[45:54] would be an assistance and a support in
[45:56] times of hardship and distress so he
[45:58] made himself like us so that we could
[46:00] face those principalities and powers and
[46:02] he would be a faithful high priest and
[46:04] be there with us through it all amen
[46:07] and those very powers were actually
[46:09] created for him
[46:11] and by him colossians 1 16 says for by
[46:14] him all things were created and in
[46:16] heaven and in earth visible and
[46:18] invisible whether thrones or dominions
[46:20] or principalities or powers all things
[46:22] were created for him and through him
[46:25] not only that
[46:27] but there is a limit to the enemy's
[46:30] power amen in romans 8 38 it says for i
[46:32] am persuaded that neither death nor life
[46:35] nor angels nor principalities nor powers
[46:39] nor present nor things to come nor
[46:42] height nor depth nor any creature
[46:44] nothing can separate us from the love of
[46:47] god which is in christ jesus with christ
[46:49] jesus lives in me he overcame these
[46:52] things so that means that those things
[46:53] can't overcome me amen just like the
[46:56] pastor always is saying the devil ain't
[46:58] nothing amen he's just mad that we're
[47:01] eternal beings and he's not
[47:04] we find uh we're gonna we're gonna look
[47:06] through some
[47:07] um
[47:09] we're gonna look through some more
[47:10] scripture here uh you know sometimes the
[47:12] enemy can get so angry at us and with us
[47:15] as the children of god because we are
[47:18] always being delivered from his hand
[47:20] every time he will do everything he can
[47:23] though to kill us and destroy us
[47:24] remember he's our adversary
[47:26] david said that we find david in a point
[47:31] in first samuel and verse
[47:34] first samuel 27 chapter 27 we find
[47:37] david at a point of such discouraging
[47:40] discouragement in his spirit at this
[47:41] point david had just uh this was this
[47:44] was actually three years after the
[47:46] victory over the philistine army by
[47:48] celane goliath
[47:50] and david was at a time where he was
[47:53] fleeing from saul he was running for his
[47:55] life and and it was i think three or
[47:57] four different times where he had
[47:59] actually escaped death
[48:01] and david spent most of that time
[48:03] fleeing from scott saul and that
[48:05] discouragement actually seeped down into
[48:07] his spirit
[48:08] and verse verse 1 it says and david said
[48:10] in his art i shall now perish one day
[48:13] by the hand of saul
[48:15] there is nothing
[48:17] better for me than that i should
[48:19] speedily speedily escape into the land
[48:22] of the philistines into the land of the
[48:24] enemy and saul shall despair of me to
[48:27] seek any more
[48:29] in any coast of israel so shall i escape
[48:33] out of his hand sometimes we can't
[48:35] recognize it right away
[48:37] but trauma the trauma that he was facing
[48:41] can cause believers to slip into a state
[48:43] of spiritual amnesia
[48:46] david was already at this point anointed
[48:48] to be king of israel by samuel several
[48:50] chapters later earlier
[48:52] he was all he had already defeated
[48:54] goliath years earlier and he was
[48:56] actually promoted to high ranks among
[48:58] the army of israel he had much respect
[49:00] in the land and god was with him
[49:01] wherever he went amen
[49:03] yet he found through a great trial
[49:06] himself in psalms 18 we don't have to go
[49:08] but in psalms 18 4 and 5 it says the
[49:10] sorrows of death come past me this is
[49:13] david speaking and the floods of ungodly
[49:15] men made me afraid and the sorrows of
[49:18] hell compassed me about the snares of
[49:21] death prevented me it said he said in
[49:23] his heart that there is nothing better
[49:25] for me that i should escape because saul
[49:27] is going to kill me anyway he was going
[49:30] through a great trial a great trauma and
[49:33] what we can easily forget that in those
[49:35] times of great trial and trauma it's
[49:37] just actually the starting point for a
[49:39] merciful road to deliverance
[49:42] to a powerful deliverance amen because
[49:44] if we never went through those times of
[49:46] great trial or great trauma or great
[49:48] disappointment our character in christ
[49:51] wouldn't be where it is today amen
[49:55] because character in christ comes
[49:57] through
[49:58] victory now the prophet shows us this in
[50:01] uh picking it up in the smirny and
[50:03] church age and this is a bit of a
[50:04] lengthy quote but i'm just going to make
[50:05] some comments and
[50:07] there was
[50:08] everything in this was just so good i
[50:09] couldn't take anything out but so the
[50:11] lord god almighty says i know that here
[50:14] he is walking in the midst of the people
[50:15] there he is the chief shepherd of the
[50:17] flock but does he hold back the
[50:19] persecution does he stem the tribulation
[50:22] no he does not he simply says i know
[50:26] your tribulation i am not at all
[50:28] unmindful of your suffering but what a
[50:31] stumbling block this is to so many
[50:34] people
[50:35] like israel they wonder if really god
[50:37] loves them
[50:38] how can god be just and loving if he
[50:41] just stands by and watches his people
[50:43] suffer i've heard that all
[50:45] so many times over the years how can he
[50:47] watch people suffer
[50:48] this is what they ask in malachi 1
[50:51] 1-3 the burden of the word of the lord
[50:53] to israel by malachi
[50:54] i have loved you saith the lord yet ye
[50:57] say wherein hastil loved us was not he
[51:00] saw jacob's brother sayeth the lord yet
[51:02] i loved jacob and i hated esau and laid
[51:05] his mountains and his heritage a waste
[51:07] for dragons of the wilderness you see
[51:10] they couldn't figure out god's love
[51:13] they thought that love meant no
[51:15] suffering and they thought that love
[51:17] meant a baby with prenatal care
[51:20] but god says that his love was elective
[51:24] love amen and the proof of his love is
[51:27] election that no matter what happens
[51:31] his love was proven truly by the fact
[51:34] that they were chosen unto salvation
[51:37] because he picks up a scripture because
[51:39] god has chosen you to salvation through
[51:41] sanctification of the spirit
[51:44] and
[51:45] belief of the truth
[51:47] amen how many of us tonight believe the
[51:49] truth of this message tonight
[51:52] he may commit you to the death as he did
[51:55] paul he may commit you to suffering as
[51:57] he did job but that is his prerogative
[52:00] i'm still in the quote so bear with me
[52:02] he is sovereign but it is all with a
[52:06] purpose amen if it did not if he did not
[52:09] have a purpose then he would be the
[52:10] author of frustration and not of peace
[52:13] but he's the author of peace amen his
[52:15] purpose is that after we have suffered a
[52:18] while that we would be made perfect and
[52:20] be established and strengthened and
[52:23] settled job says he put strength in us
[52:25] in job 23 he himself suffered
[52:28] he learned obedience by those things
[52:30] which he suffered and he was made
[52:32] perfect by those things amen
[52:35] though yet he were a son he learned
[52:36] obedience by the things that he suffered
[52:38] and he was and he was being made perfect
[52:40] amen that's what trials are it's making
[52:42] us perfect through the love of god and
[52:45] in plain language the prophet says the
[52:47] very character of jesus was perfected by
[52:51] suffering
[52:52] no man suffered more than jesus christ
[52:54] and according to paul he has left his
[52:57] church a measure of suffering
[52:59] that they too by their faith in god
[53:01] while suffering for him
[53:04] would come to a place of perfection
[53:07] but the prophet picks up and he says why
[53:09] does he stand by
[53:11] the reason is in romans 8 he says and if
[53:14] children than heirs and heirs of god
[53:17] joint heirs with christ amen if so be
[53:20] that we suffer with him that we may be
[53:23] also glorified together
[53:26] for i reckon that the sufferings of this
[53:28] present time are not worthy to be care
[53:30] compared with the glory which shall be
[53:31] revealed in us
[53:32] and he picks this up and he says unless
[53:34] we suffer with him then
[53:37] we cannot reign with him you have to
[53:40] suffer to reign amen the reason that
[53:44] this charac that this character simply
[53:47] is never made without suffering
[53:50] character is a victory not a gift
[53:53] satan is so mad at us for this reason
[53:56] because he has never won a true victory
[53:58] like we have he possesses zero character
[54:01] and he's so mad that he can't get us to
[54:03] serve him hey man he doesn't even
[54:05] understand those things that he does to
[54:07] us that he gets us with those trials
[54:09] that he gets us with that he thinks that
[54:11] he's got us but really what those things
[54:13] are doing are just getting us closer to
[54:15] our position in jesus christ they're
[54:18] getting us closer to reigning with jesus
[54:20] christ so bring it on satan give me all
[54:22] you got because i'm getting closer and
[54:24] you're doing it by your trials that
[54:26] you're sending me a man a man without
[54:28] character can't reign because apart from
[54:30] character because power apart from
[54:32] character is satanic but the but power
[54:35] with character is fit to rule amen
[54:39] and since he wants us to share his
[54:41] throne with us
[54:43] since he wants to share his throne even
[54:44] on the same basis that he overcame
[54:47] then we have to overcome to sit in the
[54:50] throne with him and the little temporary
[54:53] suffering that is now that is it's not
[54:55] worthy to be compared with the
[54:57] tremendous glory
[54:59] that will be revealed in us when he
[55:01] comes oh what treasures are laid up for
[55:03] those who are willing
[55:04] to enter into his kingdom through much
[55:06] tribulation amen
[55:08] thinking not strange concerning the
[55:10] fiery trials that are to try to you is
[55:12] it strange that god wants to develop a
[55:15] christ-like character that comes through
[55:17] suffering
[55:18] no sir
[55:20] this is a special and we're talking
[55:22] about this was this was in the smyrna in
[55:24] church age so we're talking about the
[55:26] condition in the smyrnan church age but
[55:28] it says that the prophet says that this
[55:30] must be applied to every age there is no
[55:32] age free from it there is no true
[55:36] believer how many true believers i have
[55:37] here tonight this is of god and this is
[55:39] the will of god it is needful we need
[55:42] the lord to teach us the truth that we
[55:44] are to suffer
[55:46] and be christ christ-like in doing it to
[55:49] be christ-like in our suffering that is
[55:52] a responsibility that each of us have
[55:55] does he love us yes but how shall we
[55:57] know we shall know because he said so
[56:00] and manifested that he did
[56:03] love us for he brought us to himself and
[56:05] gave us his spirit
[56:07] placing us as sons and coming down to
[56:10] the end of it he says and how shall i
[56:12] prove my love to him
[56:14] by believing what he said and by
[56:16] conducting myself listen here by
[56:18] conducting myself with joy amidst the
[56:22] trials
[56:23] that he is in
[56:24] wisdom allows it to come to pass in his
[56:28] wisdom amen so we know this to be truth
[56:30] glory yet sometimes we fall into that
[56:33] state of forgetfulness none of us are
[56:36] exempt from that forgetful state either
[56:38] because we all suffer traumas we all
[56:40] suffer hurts we all suffer trials amen
[56:43] but it's so often times
[56:45] that
[56:47] that when you're in the middle of it how
[56:49] how you think to yourself how can this
[56:51] possibly work out for my good we start
[56:53] we start thinking
[56:55] we start trying to have the mind of god
[56:56] in us how is this possibly going to work
[56:58] out for my good we we we try to play
[57:01] that why oh lord would this happen to me
[57:04] and you begin to ask yourself
[57:06] as i'm sure david did
[57:08] what could i have done differently for
[57:10] saul not to want to kill me
[57:13] what did i do to earn this
[57:15] why is this happening could i have done
[57:18] more his current state caused his mind
[57:22] to drift now i want you i'm going to
[57:25] pick this up later i don't want to get
[57:26] ahead of myself but the discouragement
[57:28] isn't a sin the discouragement happens
[57:31] it's going to happen to each of every
[57:32] each and every one of us but what david
[57:34] allowed the discouragement to grow into
[57:36] became sin amen he left the land of
[57:40] promise and went into the philistine
[57:42] land the enemy's land and later on we go
[57:44] to find out that he didn't even
[57:46] seek the lord he was backslidden for
[57:48] over a year a year and a half in fact
[57:51] amen
[57:52] your wonderings
[57:55] don't just affect you
[57:57] they affect those around you
[57:59] pick this up david arose and he passed
[58:02] over with
[58:03] 600 men that were with him unto akish
[58:07] the son of mayok the king of gaith and
[58:09] they and david dwelt with achish at gath
[58:12] he and his men every man with his
[58:14] household even david with his two wives
[58:17] so he had 600 men 600 men's wives 600
[58:21] men's children his wives
[58:24] david fled to the enemy's territory but
[58:26] and sometimes we don't realize it but
[58:28] our state of being affects everyone
[58:31] around you your family your children
[58:34] your church body each one of us you may
[58:37] not think of it but each one of you are
[58:39] a tremendous influence on somebody amen
[58:42] brother brandon picks us up he says when
[58:44] aiken took a wedge it wasn't god's shape
[58:46] faith that did it it was a babylonian
[58:49] garment we're going to pick that up
[58:50] later but when one
[58:51] uh and a wedge of gold out of the camp
[58:54] and when he did it it hindered the whole
[58:56] battle one person hindered the whole
[58:58] battle one member he says suffers all
[59:00] members suffer what god is coming to one
[59:03] of these days brothers is a church
[59:05] without spot or wrinkle he's coming to a
[59:09] spirit-filled church that divinely love
[59:11] of god so welded together in our hearts
[59:14] that that we'll walk as one that's where
[59:16] i want to be that's where each of one of
[59:18] us should want to be amen
[59:20] first samuel 29 now we're going to skip
[59:23] a little bit here but first samuel 29
[59:25] and we'll just paraphrase here but the
[59:27] thing being played out here is that the
[59:28] philistines were actually gathering
[59:30] together to fight against the israelites
[59:33] once again now and this was this was
[59:35] david was still in the land of akush at
[59:37] this time
[59:38] yet this time one one person that was at
[59:42] once their greatest foe
[59:44] amen remember he he slew goliath which
[59:46] was one of their great generals at one
[59:48] time so many years prior
[59:51] was now getting ready to fight with the
[59:54] philistines
[59:56] the same philistines which he defeated
[59:59] know three years prior
[1:00:01] that discouragement seeped into david's
[1:00:04] spirit and even the philistine leaders
[1:00:07] questioned what was happening in verse
[1:00:09] 29 it says what do these hebrews do here
[1:00:11] they knew david and his reputation
[1:00:14] against their army amen
[1:00:16] but sometimes we find ourselves in
[1:00:18] david's position
[1:00:19] so far into the enemy's territory
[1:00:22] that
[1:00:23] we're lost we're backslidden and it was
[1:00:26] from something that was a discouragement
[1:00:28] that we should have been able to
[1:00:29] overcome by the word of god but it
[1:00:31] seeped into our spirit amen
[1:00:34] another incredible we and we find this
[1:00:35] we're going to pick this up in joshua
[1:00:37] another incredible warrior of the faith
[1:00:39] took the baton from moses we're familiar
[1:00:41] with the story and to cross the people
[1:00:43] over to jordan
[1:00:45] and there's so many types in the old
[1:00:46] testament but the type here is that
[1:00:49] we're not yet in the promised land but
[1:00:51] we're fighting to get there but we have
[1:00:52] crossed over jordan we have the holy
[1:00:54] ghost in our lives and we're cross and
[1:00:56] we're fighting our way to the promised
[1:00:58] land and when he says that
[1:00:59] joshua picks this up and he says that
[1:01:01] every or the lord says to joshua that
[1:01:04] every thing every land that your foot
[1:01:06] treads upon will be yours it will be
[1:01:08] your possession not one foe will defeat
[1:01:11] you
[1:01:12] yet this time
[1:01:14] something something happened okay he
[1:01:17] came
[1:01:18] you know we're all familiar with jericho
[1:01:19] he finds himself victorious after a
[1:01:21] battle with jericho and the lord was
[1:01:23] with him and they marched around and
[1:01:25] they didn't even have to to fight after
[1:01:27] the captain of of salvation came and
[1:01:30] showed himself to him
[1:01:32] yet the very next battle arises and he
[1:01:34] didn't realize that sin had actually
[1:01:36] gotten into the camp
[1:01:39] joshua 7 and we're just going to go
[1:01:41] through you don't have to put up joshua
[1:01:43] 7 a man named aitkin had taken
[1:01:46] from the spoils of jericho
[1:01:50] you know this time a sin that it just
[1:01:52] didn't seem so major you know the god
[1:01:56] commanded
[1:01:57] uh joshua not to take any spoils from
[1:02:00] jericho yet one man decided that he was
[1:02:02] gonna take a spoil because because satan
[1:02:05] planted a seed in his mind that this
[1:02:06] isn't this isn't a big deal this is you
[1:02:08] know i'm really i'm i'm kind of on gray
[1:02:11] territory here and it doesn't seem like
[1:02:13] you know what what are they getting
[1:02:14] they're not going to use it like they're
[1:02:16] dead now why would why can't we use it
[1:02:19] that's how the enemy works in our minds
[1:02:20] he plants that seed he plants that seed
[1:02:23] of discrepancy where something that may
[1:02:25] not be a sin can
[1:02:27] quickly turn itself into a sin amen
[1:02:31] this time the sins didn't seem so major
[1:02:34] but he disobeyed god's word
[1:02:36] every word of the lord
[1:02:39] is
[1:02:40] god's word and we are not to disobey one
[1:02:43] word of it we can't take some and not
[1:02:44] the other we can't take it from here and
[1:02:46] not from here it's the whole word amen
[1:02:50] and the enemy slipped in joshua didn't
[1:02:52] know it though so he just sent a small
[1:02:54] portion of his army to battle ai they
[1:02:56] were a small enemy and they he didn't
[1:02:58] think too much of it so they just he
[1:02:59] just said a small portion of the army
[1:03:02] but the lord wasn't with them in the
[1:03:03] battle
[1:03:05] and they were driven back it says that
[1:03:06] they suffered casualties amen
[1:03:10] joshua 7
[1:03:11] and 5 says that the word
[1:03:14] the hearts of the people melted and
[1:03:16] became his water because they had
[1:03:19] remembered that word of the lord
[1:03:21] that everything that our feet were going
[1:03:23] to tread upon would be ours they had
[1:03:25] just seen a a
[1:03:27] a victory like jericho take place there
[1:03:30] was there was triumphant there was there
[1:03:32] was
[1:03:34] gumption in their in their hearts
[1:03:37] because they knew that the word of god
[1:03:39] was with them wherever they went yet
[1:03:41] they just suffered a loss from a small
[1:03:43] battle so they it says that the people's
[1:03:45] hearts melted who's ever felt like that
[1:03:48] before who's ever gone before you know
[1:03:50] they're in the middle of a trial and you
[1:03:52] fall and you slip and you're like man
[1:03:54] why
[1:03:55] wha what is happening what is going on
[1:03:58] those little things that you don't the
[1:04:01] the enemy slips in
[1:04:03] you don't think that they're big or
[1:04:04] whatever but they are amen they matter
[1:04:07] to god the little things matter to god
[1:04:10] and sometimes we do that spiritually we
[1:04:13] seek to fight the enemy without first
[1:04:15] going to the lord amen one a couple a
[1:04:19] couple times ago we were talking about
[1:04:20] seeking the lord in everything we have
[1:04:22] to go before the lord before every
[1:04:24] before every trial before everything and
[1:04:26] we have to constantly brother jason was
[1:04:28] saying we have to constantly mark our
[1:04:30] books with him we have to constantly
[1:04:31] check ourselves and our lord are we
[1:04:33] still in your perfect will i know you
[1:04:34] had your word of the lord here and i'm
[1:04:37] following that to the best of my ability
[1:04:38] but you still need to seek after his
[1:04:40] word amen
[1:04:42] you promise joshua finds himself seeking
[1:04:45] leadership after the defeat he says lord
[1:04:47] you promised everything that our foot
[1:04:50] feet would tread upon would be ours but
[1:04:52] why so why have we lost this you know
[1:04:54] why is this trial getting to us
[1:04:57] what have we done lord and the lord
[1:04:59] replies that there is sin
[1:05:01] amongst your camp
[1:05:03] that aiken had taken
[1:05:06] of the spoils against my commandment
[1:05:10] well iran picks us up in adoption he
[1:05:12] says in the promised land everything
[1:05:13] belongs to us
[1:05:15] in the promised land see everything in
[1:05:17] the promised land when israel crossed
[1:05:18] over into jordan into the promised land
[1:05:20] they fought down everything now remember
[1:05:23] in this promised land
[1:05:25] that don't mean that you're immune from
[1:05:26] sickness that don't mean that you're
[1:05:28] immune from troubles but it does spell
[1:05:31] this so let this just sink so deep it
[1:05:33] says this that it is yours just rise and
[1:05:36] take it and remember that the only way
[1:05:39] israel ever lost a man
[1:05:42] is when sin got into the camp that's the
[1:05:45] only way that we can ever lose a victory
[1:05:48] is for sin to get into the camp amen
[1:05:51] something went wrong somewhere aiken
[1:05:53] stole a wedge that babylonian garment
[1:05:55] and a sin was in the camp the battle
[1:05:57] went wrong the prophet says that the
[1:05:59] only way we can ever lose a victory is
[1:06:02] if sin gets in our camp
[1:06:04] you know the victory is laid within the
[1:06:06] journey but it's a journey of obedience
[1:06:09] to every word of god humbling yourself
[1:06:11] at every turn and laying aside as
[1:06:13] hebrews would say laying aside every
[1:06:15] weight and every sin every weight means
[1:06:18] you know the unforgiveness of a brother
[1:06:20] or the lust or the habits that you don't
[1:06:22] think are big things they matter to god
[1:06:25] laying aside every weight and every sin
[1:06:28] that so easily besets us because they do
[1:06:31] so easily beset us amen suffering like
[1:06:34] paul
[1:06:35] in corinthians yet glorying and knowing
[1:06:38] that his grace is sufficient we're types
[1:06:40] of those people today we've crossed over
[1:06:42] jordan and now we're heading into the
[1:06:44] land of promise but and everything our
[1:06:47] feet are supposed to tread upon we would
[1:06:48] overcome but overcoming doesn't always
[1:06:51] look as as it seems overcoming is taking
[1:06:54] that discouragement and not allowing it
[1:06:56] to seep into our spirit
[1:06:59] overcoming is allowing
[1:07:01] the word of god to discern your heart
[1:07:03] and those little sins to be purged out
[1:07:06] constantly seeking after him amen
[1:07:10] he didn't say that it would be free of
[1:07:12] troubles and he didn't say it would be a
[1:07:14] flowery bed of ease
[1:07:16] amen
[1:07:18] sin had gotten in the camp and it wasn't
[1:07:20] what we should think of sin
[1:07:22] it was so small it was taking
[1:07:24] of the garment holding on to that habit
[1:07:28] and many
[1:07:31] many times
[1:07:33] like david
[1:07:35] it will cause you
[1:07:37] to come to a backslidden condition
[1:07:40] and you don't you're not even realizing
[1:07:42] that you're in it you're still coming to
[1:07:44] church you're still reading your bible
[1:07:46] you're still praying but the connection
[1:07:48] with the holy ghost is hindered somehow
[1:07:51] amen
[1:07:52] and you're backslidden and not even
[1:07:54] realizing and in the enemy territory
[1:07:56] without even realizing it
[1:07:58] trials tribulations don't mistake those
[1:08:02] things for sin those are mercies from
[1:08:04] god
[1:08:05] transforming us remember remember in job
[1:08:09] he was sinless he found himself
[1:08:11] consider my servant job i think i've
[1:08:13] mentioned him in every single one of my
[1:08:14] sermons but
[1:08:17] it it's not for when you're free of
[1:08:19] troubles that's not showing god's love
[1:08:22] god's love is when you have troubles but
[1:08:24] yet in the midst of the troubles you can
[1:08:25] joy and glory in it amen
[1:08:28] how often do we let those things get us
[1:08:31] so low
[1:08:32] that we have lapsed in our trusting of
[1:08:35] god
[1:08:37] we forget that he's always been faithful
[1:08:39] amen he's always been faithful
[1:08:42] he was always faithful to david
[1:08:45] but once god not once god had failed to
[1:08:48] protect him all those times
[1:08:50] with the bear and the lion and goliath
[1:08:52] and each time saul had tried to kill him
[1:08:55] yet david finds himself discouraged
[1:08:58] and you love david through the
[1:08:59] scriptures because you can so identify
[1:09:01] with almost everything that he goes
[1:09:03] through i mean everything you're like
[1:09:04] wow so he it says he found himself
[1:09:06] discouraged so he ventures off
[1:09:08] you know thinking that saul was going to
[1:09:10] kill him anyway
[1:09:11] and this was after the anointing this
[1:09:13] was
[1:09:14] he lapsed in trusting god and during
[1:09:17] that year and a half time period he
[1:09:19] doesn't seek after the will of god one
[1:09:21] time it says that scripture doesn't show
[1:09:23] him seeking after god's will god's
[1:09:25] direction
[1:09:26] not even one time in fact he doesn't
[1:09:29] even think about god during this time
[1:09:30] because his mind was so just traumatized
[1:09:34] by what had happened
[1:09:37] david and his army went back to ziklag
[1:09:40] in first samuel versus
[1:09:41] first samuel 30
[1:09:44] and when they went back to ziklag after
[1:09:47] the philistines had rejected allowing
[1:09:49] him to fight with him
[1:09:51] they found what was
[1:09:53] what felt like to be more than they
[1:09:56] could bear
[1:09:57] amen
[1:09:59] they came over the hill to return to
[1:10:01] their families their wives and their
[1:10:03] children
[1:10:04] like after anything
[1:10:06] you came you come home to you know after
[1:10:08] work and you know you want to see your
[1:10:10] wife and your little new little baby
[1:10:12] girl and and they're not there
[1:10:14] something something has happened you
[1:10:16] don't know what happened to them and not
[1:10:17] only that they weren't there it says
[1:10:19] that they had taken everything and they
[1:10:21] had burned the place that they were in
[1:10:24] the amalekites had swept through in
[1:10:26] their absence and took all of their
[1:10:28] families captive burned down their
[1:10:30] houses their possessions their they were
[1:10:32] gone and all that they knew and loved at
[1:10:34] this point in their life
[1:10:36] was gone
[1:10:38] verse four it says that they wept until
[1:10:40] they had no power to weep
[1:10:42] who has been there before amen just
[1:10:45] weeping just in within your spirit
[1:10:47] doesn't even have to be physically
[1:10:48] crying but just you don't know where to
[1:10:50] go you don't know where to turn because
[1:10:52] you're in a state of spiritual amnesia i
[1:10:55] know exactly where to turn god shows you
[1:10:57] where to turn every time
[1:10:59] and the lord will allow
[1:11:01] such things to happen
[1:11:03] so that all you can do is lie on your
[1:11:05] back and look up to him
[1:11:07] but always remember god will never leave
[1:11:09] you or forsake you he will allow the
[1:11:12] enemy a certain leeway like he allowed
[1:11:15] the amalekites a certain leeway so that
[1:11:17] he could get david back into his
[1:11:18] position into his rightful throne amen
[1:11:22] david david's wives and all this men
[1:11:24] everything was gone when we look at this
[1:11:25] history it's really important to stop
[1:11:28] and kind of put yourself in in their
[1:11:31] position okay
[1:11:34] where everything that was gone
[1:11:36] everything that was true to them
[1:11:39] everything that was true to you
[1:11:40] everything that you know and you and you
[1:11:42] really
[1:11:43] you know you don't think that you're
[1:11:45] really out of the will of god because
[1:11:47] you know a discouragement like i said
[1:11:50] it's not the sin but it had led to the
[1:11:51] sin amen and you find yourself doing the
[1:11:55] same things it what would i i
[1:11:58] read one commentary and it said that
[1:12:00] david had
[1:12:02] david needed to flee to the land of the
[1:12:04] philistines because saul was pursuing
[1:12:07] after him no david did not need to flee
[1:12:10] to the enemy's land he was in the land
[1:12:12] of promise
[1:12:13] god wherever your land is you will
[1:12:16] conquer it with the word of god you just
[1:12:19] have to stand and trust in god when you
[1:12:21] have nothing else to trust in amen
[1:12:24] the enemy can be ruthless in those times
[1:12:26] of ins of uncertainty
[1:12:28] you know where where my family go had
[1:12:30] they been destroyed you know would i
[1:12:32] ever am i ever gonna see them again
[1:12:35] he sends he sends
[1:12:37] mind battles he plagues your mind
[1:12:41] with unimaginable things
[1:12:43] that's that's when satan is is at his
[1:12:46] high point
[1:12:47] and they became so distressed that they
[1:12:50] actually wanted to stone david
[1:12:53] and in later verses it says that the
[1:12:55] amalekites were rejoicing and dancing
[1:12:58] and partying after they had taken from
[1:13:00] the spoils of david now remember david
[1:13:03] david was out of the land of promise but
[1:13:05] he's still god's son amen you may be out
[1:13:08] of the will of god but you're still
[1:13:10] god's son so he just you just have to
[1:13:12] make one turn one confession one
[1:13:14] repentance and you're right back on that
[1:13:16] path amen glory to god
[1:13:18] it says you know the enemy you know the
[1:13:20] enemy uh he'll laugh at
[1:13:22] he'll laugh at you he'll laugh when he
[1:13:25] sees someone now i'll
[1:13:27] take a little bit of a turn here he
[1:13:28] laughs when he sees
[1:13:31] someone that we hold dear to us
[1:13:34] not serving god
[1:13:36] living in the world amen we're all we
[1:13:38] all have someone that we hold dear to us
[1:13:40] that isn't serving god maybe in the
[1:13:42] capacity that they should or at all and
[1:13:46] he thinks that because of that
[1:13:49] that
[1:13:50] he's got a victory over us
[1:13:52] or when he sees one of us fail
[1:13:54] one of us
[1:13:56] falter one of us allow the
[1:13:58] discouragement in our spirit he thinks i
[1:13:59] mean he's over there rejoicing
[1:14:02] and why why do you think that is
[1:14:05] it's because satan can't see the future
[1:14:09] satan is not omniscient and he's on
[1:14:10] omnipresent all satan can do is plan and
[1:14:14] react he cannot see the future like
[1:14:16] christ can little does he know that the
[1:14:18] real victor will show up later that
[1:14:22] night and take back everything that the
[1:14:24] enemy stole from you
[1:14:26] everything your family your children
[1:14:29] your sons your daughters everything will
[1:14:32] be returned back to you as long as you
[1:14:34] seek after the will of god and you apply
[1:14:36] the token on their life amen
[1:14:39] david's memory came back to him he
[1:14:42] remembered his position in this time of
[1:14:44] low you know you're just sitting down
[1:14:46] and you're in your in your lowest point
[1:14:49] and the only place you have to look up
[1:14:50] is up
[1:14:52] that is when god will
[1:14:54] bring to your remembrance who you are
[1:14:58] and you know what we have today
[1:15:02] where we're living at that david didn't
[1:15:05] have
[1:15:06] is that
[1:15:07] we are a bunch of davids
[1:15:09] amen you are david's when you share
[1:15:12] something with your brothers and your
[1:15:14] sisters who have faced maybe similar
[1:15:16] tragedy or similar trauma or who you
[1:15:18] know they face the same enemy we've all
[1:15:21] got the same enemy that we face they can
[1:15:24] give you encouragement amen to press on
[1:15:27] you know i was facing something last
[1:15:28] week and i had a little bit of a
[1:15:29] discouragement in my life and you know i
[1:15:32] just shared with some brothers in a text
[1:15:34] knowing that they had years of
[1:15:35] experience of facing the same enemy that
[1:15:38] i faced
[1:15:40] i knew that it would encourage me amen
[1:15:42] and satan will satan will even come and
[1:15:44] come at you when you're you're going to
[1:15:46] seek after
[1:15:47] encouragement from somebody and he'll
[1:15:49] say no you don't want to do that he'll
[1:15:50] say that you shouldn't share things with
[1:15:52] other people he'll he'll just he'll say
[1:15:54] that they'll just think lower of you
[1:15:56] amen this is how the this is how the
[1:15:57] mind battles work then they'll they'll
[1:16:00] they'll just think that your faith is
[1:16:01] too low and somehow lose respect for you
[1:16:04] that is the enemy friends they go to
[1:16:06] prayer for you a holy ghost-filled
[1:16:09] christian doesn't question you for a
[1:16:11] trial or a discouragement they encourage
[1:16:14] you amen that's why he orchestrated
[1:16:17] putting you into this assembly so that
[1:16:20] you'd have others you'd have each other
[1:16:22] to face those things with amen don't
[1:16:25] ever find yourself in a place where you
[1:16:28] think that you're the only one who has
[1:16:30] ever faced what you're going through
[1:16:32] there is nothing ecclesia i think it's
[1:16:34] ecclesiastes there is nothing new under
[1:16:36] the sun and rather than shutting people
[1:16:39] out
[1:16:40] open yourself up and allow them in to
[1:16:43] help you go through your experiences
[1:16:45] amen
[1:16:47] you were you were vulnerable
[1:16:50] for the snare that overtook you amen you
[1:16:52] were vulnerable for that thing that
[1:16:54] overtook you now be vulnerable to allow
[1:16:56] the holy spirit to mend you be
[1:16:58] vulnerable to allow your friends to
[1:17:01] encourage you it takes a certain amount
[1:17:03] of vulnerability it takes a certain
[1:17:05] amount of stepping out of your comfort
[1:17:07] zone and realizing that okay lord like
[1:17:10] you know i need i need some help in this
[1:17:12] i need i need my brothers and on my
[1:17:14] sisters the enemy's facing me i've got
[1:17:16] my mind battles plaguing me that's what
[1:17:19] that's when we look to each other we
[1:17:21] look to the body of believers that we
[1:17:23] have we look to our moms and our dads
[1:17:25] and our brothers and our sisters in
[1:17:27] christ amen
[1:17:29] amen we don't have moms and dads in
[1:17:30] christ but you know our moms and dads
[1:17:32] began crying david began crying out to
[1:17:35] the lord in psalms 18 it says verse 1 it
[1:17:38] says i will love thee o lord my strength
[1:17:41] and the lord is my rock and my salvation
[1:17:43] he began he began it says to encourage
[1:17:46] himself

[1:17:52] strength and whom i trust my buckler my
[1:17:55] horn of salvation my high tower i will
[1:17:58] call upon the lord who is worthy to be
[1:18:00] praised so shall i so i shall be saved
[1:18:03] from my enemies glory to god psalms 25
[1:18:05] it says unto thee o lord do i lift up my
[1:18:08] soul
[1:18:09] oh my god i will trust in thee let me
[1:18:12] not be ashamed let not my enemies
[1:18:14] triumph over me psalms 34 it says i
[1:18:16] sought the lord
[1:18:18] and he delivered me from all of my fears
[1:18:21] psalms 40 says i waited these are all
[1:18:23] psalms that david wrote psalms 40 i
[1:18:25] waited patiently for the lord and he
[1:18:27] inclined unto me he heard my cry he
[1:18:30] brought me out of this horrible pit out
[1:18:33] of the myrik clay and set my feet upon a
[1:18:35] rock he established my goings and he
[1:18:38] hath put a new song in my mouth even
[1:18:40] praise unto our god
[1:18:42] many shall see it and fear and shall
[1:18:45] trust in the lord amen he encouraged
[1:18:48] himself in the lord friends he was
[1:18:50] backslidden he had found himself in a
[1:18:52] place where he didn't even acknowledge
[1:18:54] god and his amnesia the discouragement
[1:18:58] his condition went on for so long and it
[1:19:01] took it took that place for david to
[1:19:04] come to
[1:19:05] where god was his only strength
[1:19:08] and you asked why would god strengthen
[1:19:10] him after this because god is rich in
[1:19:12] mercy and grace and because david was
[1:19:15] now completely broken now ready to be
[1:19:18] filled
[1:19:19] david finally remembered god's promise
[1:19:21] and his calling and his memory came back
[1:19:23] to him sometimes when a person has
[1:19:25] amnesia from some kind of trauma
[1:19:28] physically or mentally
[1:19:30] a familiar face or a voice
[1:19:34] or a place will trigger their memory to
[1:19:37] come back to them amen and there's a
[1:19:39] whole study you can do on that
[1:19:41] we're not going to get into that but let
[1:19:42] let that familiarity that you need be
[1:19:46] found for you tonight in the word of god
[1:19:48] amen don't let your condition go on any
[1:19:52] longer tonight amen
[1:19:54] first samuel 30 and verse 8 it says that
[1:19:56] he inquired of the lord and the lord and
[1:19:59] he said lord shall i pursue after my
[1:20:01] enemy shall i overtake them and the lord
[1:20:04] answers he says pursue
[1:20:07] for thou
[1:20:08] shalt surely
[1:20:10] overtake them and without fail recover
[1:20:14] all that was lost
[1:20:16] amen glory to god i just want to soak in
[1:20:19] that for a minute and without fail he
[1:20:22] will suffer all to be given back to you
[1:20:25] amen every discouragement every fear
[1:20:29] every family member everything will be
[1:20:32] given back to us glory to god you know
[1:20:35] and out of the 600 men you know two of
[1:20:37] them were so they found themselves so
[1:20:39] distressed at the situation
[1:20:42] at their loss they couldn't even go with
[1:20:44] david to pursue after the enemy and now
[1:20:47] david with less of an army than when he
[1:20:49] started pursuing after an enemy that he
[1:20:52] had no idea what their number was he had
[1:20:54] no idea where they were but he had the
[1:20:56] word from the lord all it takes when
[1:20:59] you're 4 000 steps in the wrong
[1:21:01] direction is with a word from the lord
[1:21:03] to get you right back into step glory to
[1:21:06] god many times glory to god many times
[1:21:09] in scripture in our lives the lord will
[1:21:11] allow what little strength that we think
[1:21:14] that we possess
[1:21:16] to be stripped away
[1:21:18] so that we know that he is the one
[1:21:20] fighting for us glory because in our
[1:21:22] weaknesses he is made strong glory to
[1:21:25] god
[1:21:26] possess we shall recover all amen
[1:21:29] that promise still stands for tonight
[1:21:31] amen just as the enemy thought that he
[1:21:34] had victory our mighty conqueror would
[1:21:36] sweep in first samuel 30 and 16.
[1:21:39] it says and when he had brought him down
[1:21:41] behold they were spread abroad upon all
[1:21:44] the earth
[1:21:45] eating and drinking and mary and dancing
[1:21:49] because of all the spoil that they had
[1:21:51] taken the devil was laughing at you
[1:21:54] because you fell the devil is laughing
[1:21:56] because your
[1:21:57] your daughter your son is out in the
[1:21:59] world the devil's laughing because you
[1:22:01] you got something that's that's that's
[1:22:03] hindering you you got you've got a habit
[1:22:05] that he thinks that he's got you and
[1:22:07] just when he thinks that he has that
[1:22:09] victory over you
[1:22:12] david smote them
[1:22:14] and recovered all that was taken
[1:22:17] when the word promises restoration
[1:22:20] it doesn't have limitations
[1:22:23] glory to god
[1:22:25] i will restore saith the lord even if
[1:22:28] you go on your own path i will restore
[1:22:30] even if you get discouraged i will
[1:22:32] restore even if you get amnesia and
[1:22:34] forget your position i will bring to
[1:22:37] your remembrance who you are
[1:22:42] amen
[1:22:45] amen when we're coming up on easter amen
[1:22:48] and remember when the enemy thought that
[1:22:50] he had won the final victory jesus
[1:22:52] christ
[1:22:53] being nailed to the cross
[1:22:55] satan satan was just like the amalekites
[1:22:58] singing and dancing for joy finally i
[1:23:01] got rid of him finally finally this man
[1:23:03] oh i got him he's hung on a cross and
[1:23:06] there's no just it's just when that
[1:23:08] happens oh he hears a knock it did he

[1:23:22] than david amen to take back those keys

[1:23:28] hosea the valley of trouble or the
[1:23:30] valley of um aiken
[1:23:33] uh let's see let's turn back to it if we
[1:23:34] can
[1:23:35] uh 14
[1:23:37] verse 15 i will give you her i will give
[1:23:39] her vineyards from thence and the valley
[1:23:42] of aker for a door of hope and she shall
[1:23:45] sing there as in the days of her youth
[1:23:48] now
[1:23:50] aiken had taken the spoils back to
[1:23:52] joshua aiken had taken the spoils and he
[1:23:54] allowed the enemy to slip in
[1:23:57] and
[1:23:59] joshua asks what that they what what do
[1:24:02] we need to do how do how do we get how
[1:24:04] do we
[1:24:05] what do we need to do lord
[1:24:07] and the lord says that you need to purge
[1:24:08] the sin from the camp you need to lay
[1:24:11] down that weight you need to lay down
[1:24:13] that forgive unforgiveness you need to
[1:24:15] lay down that lust you need to lay down
[1:24:16] that habit you need to lay down that
[1:24:18] snare it says snares that means anything
[1:24:20] that is hindering your relationship with
[1:24:22] the lord jesus christ lay down that
[1:24:24] thing that you won't let go of and god
[1:24:26] will take you to places where you need
[1:24:28] to be
[1:24:29] he will take those valleys of sin that
[1:24:32] you were in
[1:24:33] which the valley of uh aitkin became
[1:24:38] akin was purged and aiken became the
[1:24:40] valley of acor which translates
[1:24:43] literally to the valley of trouble and
[1:24:45] it was it says in verse 15 of hosea that
[1:24:49] that valley of akin that valley of
[1:24:51] trouble will be turned into a gateway of
[1:24:54] hope
[1:24:55] glory to god
[1:24:57] that snare was cast out the israelites
[1:25:00] didn't know whether or not they would
[1:25:02] get another victory after disobeying god
[1:25:05] it says remember it says that their
[1:25:06] hearts were melted with them within them
[1:25:09] you know we
[1:25:11] i've said this before but you know you
[1:25:12] can't read the scriptures and just skip
[1:25:14] ahead and think i mean this is this is
[1:25:15] their lives that they're living in they
[1:25:16] they had just suffered a defeat and now
[1:25:18] they all they had to do was turn back to
[1:25:20] the lord but they had disobeyed his word
[1:25:22] so now they didn't know if they were
[1:25:23] ever going to possess the land they
[1:25:26] didn't know if they were ever going to
[1:25:27] get another victory they were just at
[1:25:29] the mercy of jehovah
[1:25:33] what was once a snare in your life
[1:25:36] amen i'm talking to each one of us miss
[1:25:38] me you which was once a snare in your
[1:25:41] life the lord can turn that into a
[1:25:44] gateway of hope
[1:25:46] why is caleb why in the world did you
[1:25:49] tie those three things together how do
[1:25:51] they correlate the word of god is a
[1:25:53] masterpiece i was sitting in my study
[1:25:55] this morning just studying trying not to
[1:25:57] wake my baby up and i just headed a
[1:25:59] silent jubilee dancing and shouting when
[1:26:01] he showed me this
[1:26:02] oh glory
[1:26:04] for time's sake we don't need to turn
[1:26:05] there but for reference sake if you want
[1:26:08] to read at home hosea chapter one the
[1:26:10] word of one for one through five just
[1:26:13] read it when you get home on your own
[1:26:14] time but the word of the lord comes to
[1:26:16] hosea the prophet and it was an odd word
[1:26:19] he was commanded to take a prostitute
[1:26:21] for a wife and hosea listened to the
[1:26:24] lord
[1:26:24] and when he did that they had they were
[1:26:27] blessed with a child and their first
[1:26:28] child that was born the lord commanded
[1:26:31] hosea to name him jezreel
[1:26:34] and scripture references in the fifth
[1:26:35] verse that god would break the bow of
[1:26:38] israel in the valley of jezreel now i
[1:26:40] did some digging and to come to find out
[1:26:42] the valerie of jezreel is located within
[1:26:46] mount gilboa in the spur of the valley
[1:26:49] near the bottom of the mountain mount
[1:26:50] gilboa is the very place that the enemy
[1:26:53] slew saw and david's kingdom was
[1:26:56] restored back to david glory to god
[1:26:59] he'll take that valley of jezreel he'll
[1:27:01] take that valley of trouble and he'll
[1:27:03] turn it into a gateway of hope no one
[1:27:06] else like hosea could could prophesy
[1:27:10] like that he lord you want me to take
[1:27:12] who and and do what oh but he turned it
[1:27:14] around glory to god it just goes to show
[1:27:17] that it doesn't matter where you're at
[1:27:19] does it matter
[1:27:20] what how far you feel like you're down
[1:27:23] the lord can take you from the place
[1:27:25] that you're at into a gateway of hope
[1:27:28] glory to god
[1:27:29] oh you'll never tell me the word of god
[1:27:32] is an inspired that was a thousand years
[1:27:34] apart and the lord jesus was hosea was
[1:27:36] 800 years after joshua glory to god
[1:27:40] don't think that your valley is too big
[1:27:42] tonight nothing is out of reach for the
[1:27:45] orchestrator hallelujah you can think
[1:27:48] your weight your snare your sin is the
[1:27:51] most low down thing and no doubt it is
[1:27:54] it is low down all sin is low down and
[1:27:58] it's not a place for the house of god
[1:28:01] but that's why we come into the house of
[1:28:03] god because it's a house of correction
[1:28:05] amen and i want the lord jesus to
[1:28:07] correct me in everything in every way
[1:28:10] that every snare that so easily besets
[1:28:12] me glory to god
[1:28:15] there is a swift pack
[1:28:17] pathway back to deliverance and that is
[1:28:20] confession and it's repentance glory to
[1:28:23] god
[1:28:24] my cousin made an incredible statement i
[1:28:27] get a lot of my inspiration from him
[1:28:30] i was sharing with him that thing that i
[1:28:32] was going through last week and he said
[1:28:33] you know caleb you know this thing
[1:28:35] though it doesn't seem so now
[1:28:38] may be one of the most important things
[1:28:40] that you go through because that
[1:28:43] discouragement that thing the the mind
[1:28:46] battles that started to rage i can now
[1:28:48] stomp on the devil and say that doesn't
[1:28:50] matter because i've got a victor who's
[1:28:53] gonna break every chain in my life i'm
[1:28:55] not gonna live in the valley of
[1:28:57] discouragement like david did i'm not
[1:28:59] gonna live in the valley of sin i'm not
[1:29:01] gonna live in the valley of acor i'm
[1:29:04] gonna be like hosea and his wife i'm
[1:29:06] gonna live in the gateway of hope that
[1:29:09] the lord has brought me into glory to
[1:29:11] god
[1:29:12] oh glory to god each one of you tonight
[1:29:15] are davids glory to god stand with me as
[1:29:17] much as i'm sure that david wished that
[1:29:20] he didn't that he didn't have to flee
[1:29:22] from saul for so long or find himself in
[1:29:25] that place
[1:29:26] so much of the rest of his life so much
[1:29:29] of the psalms were shaped because of
[1:29:31] those experiences that he had so much of
[1:29:34] those things that you go through
[1:29:36] although you don't want to go through
[1:29:38] them
[1:29:39] those things shape who you will be who
[1:29:42] you will be in christ remember that
[1:29:44] without a battle then you will not reign
[1:29:47] with christ so those things that you're
[1:29:49] battling will become your victory and
[1:29:51] then you'll have character now remember
[1:29:53] satan doesn't have character so you've
[1:29:56] got that on him glory to god brother
[1:29:58] branham picks it up and oh in the great
[1:30:01] warrior david who is that uncircumcised
[1:30:03] devil who is that devil that has no
[1:30:05] relationship with god at all who is that
[1:30:08] devil that stands with nothing but a
[1:30:10] defeated thing behind him his master was
[1:30:12] defeated at calvary by our lord and our
[1:30:15] conqueror hallelujah he's a bluff that's
[1:30:18] all we won't believe him any more down
[1:30:21] with him jesus christ robbed satan of
[1:30:25] everything he had he spoiled
[1:30:26] principalities powers dominions his
[1:30:30] domain reigns over the heavens and we
[1:30:32] are the subject of his domain hallelujah
[1:30:36] my that puts him where he belongs glory
[1:30:38] to god you're called you are elected you
[1:30:42] are anointed you are positionally placed

[1:31:05] was
[1:31:06] oh he he was it says that he drew near
[1:31:09] to god he drew me out of many waters
[1:31:13] remember when it says that they melted
[1:31:14] their hearts melted like water
[1:31:16] david's heart melted like that but it
[1:31:18] says that the lord jesus drew me out of
[1:31:20] those many waters he delivered me from
[1:31:22] my strong enemy psalm 6 18 verse 16 and
[1:31:26] from them which hated me

[1:37:22] lord it's a challenge it's also a
[1:37:25] message of encouragement and hope lord
[1:37:27] as our brother caleb said you could take
[1:37:29] our valley of trouble
[1:37:31] and turn it into a gateway of hope
[1:37:34] let us lord not just be hearers tonight
[1:37:36] of your word that we've heard let us be
[1:37:38] doers

[1:37:43] raise my hands now and say god let me
[1:37:46] water it with faith let me water it with
[1:37:48] praise lord may you may it bring forth
[1:37:52] your truth your fruit lord in my life
[1:37:56] thank you for it lord jesus i pray for
[1:37:58] each one here each one that listened
[1:38:00] online
[1:38:01] lord i just feel just to stop and just
[1:38:04] talk to you just for a minute lord
[1:38:05] before we go into the request to let the
[1:38:08] word that we've heard sink in lord i
[1:38:10] believe it was you who spoke you moved
[1:38:12] brother caleb stepped out of the way
[1:38:14] lord and your word went forth lord and
[1:38:17] it's healing to the broken if they would
[1:38:19] receive it
[1:38:21] it's truth to the backslider if he would
[1:38:23] receive it it's restoration to all of us
[1:38:26] lord as your as our brother said there's
[1:38:28] no limit to your restoration no matter
[1:38:31] what we need no matter what we have need
[1:38:33] of tonight
[1:38:34] [Music]
[1:38:36] we can reach out
[1:38:37] with faith with the hand raised and in
[1:38:39] faith we could touch the hem of your
[1:38:41] garment
[1:38:42] i wonder if someone could just do that
[1:38:44] here tonight could just reach out in
[1:38:46] faith and say lord i want to touch you
[1:38:48] father i want to touch just a piece of
[1:38:50] your garment i know if i could just
[1:38:52] touch jesus i'll be made whole that's my

[1:39:25] after brother branham brother caleb was
[1:39:27] talking about character and how that
[1:39:29] it's it's a uh not a gift but it's a
[1:39:31] victory
[1:39:32] brother branham says this the cloudy
[1:39:34] skies
[1:39:35] and storms of life are no sign of god's
[1:39:38] disapproval
[1:39:40] neither are bright skies and still
[1:39:42] waters
[1:39:43] signs of his love and approval
[1:39:45] his approval of us is only in the
[1:39:48] beloved
[1:39:50] his love is elective
[1:39:52] which he had for us
[1:39:54] before the foundation of the world then
[1:39:56] brother adam says does he love us
[1:39:59] say does he love me
[1:40:01] ah

[1:40:12] matt because he said he loved you
[1:40:16] and manifested that he did love us for

[1:40:20] spirit

[1:40:22] as sons

[1:40:36] no lord i want to say how can i prove my
[1:40:39] love that i love you brother adam says
[1:40:42] by believing what he said
[1:40:45] and by conducting myself with joy
[1:40:48] amidst trials
[1:40:50] that he and his wisdom allows
[1:40:53] to come to pass
[1:40:54] the valley of trouble
