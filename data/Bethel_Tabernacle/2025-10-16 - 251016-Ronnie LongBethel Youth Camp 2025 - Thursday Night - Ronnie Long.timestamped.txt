================================================================================

[18:47] my first year at camp, but I'm going to
[18:49] be your co-director. Um, our director is
[18:51] Brother Matt Watkins and of course our
[18:53] home pastor at Bethl Tabernacle is
[18:55] Brother Jason Watkins. Couple of quick
[18:57] announcements we want to make. Uh choir
[19:00] practice is going to be Friday at 2:30
[19:02] and Saturday at 3:30. You can come to
[19:05] practice even if you didn't sign up. So
[19:07] we want as many volunteers as we can to
[19:09] come over to that. Skip practice is
[19:11] going to immediately follow breakfast
[19:13] tomorrow morning. Okay.
[19:16] Now getting into the rules. So we want
[19:19] everybody to have a safe time here.
[19:21] That's our top priority. Well, our top
[19:23] priority is to serve the Lord. So our
[19:25] top priority is to have a good time in
[19:26] the Lord and then for safety. So,
[19:30] we uh if you have any concerns or you
[19:32] see anything that alerts you or you have
[19:33] questions about, make sure you get with
[19:34] your counselors. That's what they're
[19:35] here for. So, breakfast will be at 8:30
[19:38] in the mornings. Sorry, that one got out
[19:40] of out of line there. Let your
[19:42] counselors know about any medical issues
[19:44] that you have.
[19:47] And also, a lost and found will be in
[19:49] concessions. So, keep your rooms clean.
[19:55] and
[19:57] couple of things. You should have
[19:58] already read this in your packet, but
[20:00] I'm just going to read these rules to
[20:01] you and also elaborate on a couple more
[20:02] of them. So,
[20:06] the rules, if they're violated, the
[20:08] counselor or a security team member will
[20:10] issue you a warning. The second
[20:13] violation is calling your parents and
[20:15] having them take you home. This will be
[20:17] done together with the leadership team,
[20:19] and we reserved the right to send you
[20:20] home from camp for any violation. Boys
[20:24] are not allowed into girls dorms and
[20:26] vice versa. So, girls are not allowed
[20:27] into boys dorms and this will result or
[20:30] can result in immediate expulsion. Along
[20:32] the lines of couples and intermingling,
[20:34] no unmarried couples are allowed to
[20:36] wander around together un alone. You can
[20:39] be in groups, but do not wander if
[20:41] you're not married separately off.
[20:45] You are not allowed to leave the cabin
[20:47] before rise and shine and after lights
[20:49] are out and that also can result in
[20:51] immediate expulsion. Extreme practical
[20:54] jokes and cabin raids are not allowed.
[20:57] There is no cursing, fighting, pushing,
[20:59] punching, bullying, or other
[21:01] inappropriate behavior which could
[21:02] result in immediate expulsion. Seeing a
[21:05] trend?
[21:08] It is not allowed to watch movies or
[21:10] television shows on apps in the cabins.
[21:13] When it's time for lights out, phones
[21:15] must be put away. The hiking trails are
[21:18] for organized hikes only, so do not go
[21:21] hiking without supervision. That
[21:22] schedule will be posted. And also, no
[21:26] couples that are not married hiking. So,
[21:29] camper campers are not allowed to drive
[21:31] to golf carts. Campers are not allowed
[21:33] to leave camp once they have checked in
[21:35] unless you have prior approval. Um, if
[21:38] you have to be driven,
[21:41] uh, oh, I'm sorry. Those who have driven
[21:43] here, make sure you leave your cars in
[21:44] the parking spot.
[21:46] All campers must attend the entire
[21:49] chapel services unless they are feeling
[21:51] unwell, in which case you need to get
[21:52] with the medical staff. Also, that said,
[21:55] make sure to use the restroom before
[21:56] coming into chapel. We want as few
[21:58] distractions as we can have. Um, all
[22:02] campers must be in their cabins after
[22:04] lights out. We hit that again, so we're
[22:05] going to keep reiterating some of these.
[22:08] No headphones or AirPods or any kind of
[22:11] electronic like that will be allowed
[22:12] during the day.
[22:15] Um, camp directors again reserved a
[22:17] right to send you home if they feel in
[22:20] judgment that you have violated any of
[22:21] the camp rules. All right, now getting
[22:24] into modesty. Girls, skirts and dresses
[22:27] must be below the knees when sitting
[22:30] down, even if you're wearing leggings or
[22:32] this new term snoggas. I'm still
[22:35] learning that if I said it wrong. No
[22:37] splits or slits in the dresses that are
[22:39] above the knee. So, do not have your uh
[22:42] knees visible. And no tight fitting
[22:45] clothing. No low cut or sleeveless
[22:47] shirts or dresses. No shirts that show
[22:49] your midrifts. For boys, no shorts and
[22:53] no sleeveless shirts. Uh and keep your
[22:55] rooms clean. All right. Um so again,
[23:00] kind of getting into some of the
[23:02] schedules. Breakfast is at 8:30 followed
[23:04] by a teaching. So once you finish
[23:07] eating, don't get up, just stay seated.
[23:09] And then um one of the ministers is
[23:11] going to have a little session with you.
[23:13] Then also again, choir practice will be
[23:15] at 2:30 tomorrow and 3:30 on Saturday.
[23:19] And also the sports um schedule will be
[23:22] posted as well. We should have all that
[23:24] up for you in the morning. All right.
[23:27] And with that, let's go ahead and let's
[23:29] stand.
[23:33] Okay, let's bow our heads. Lord, we just
[23:36] want to come and thank you for all the
[23:38] kindness that you give us, Lord, your
[23:39] grace and your mercy. Thank you for this
[23:42] time together, Lord. We just ask that
[23:43] you would come down, Lord, and that you
[23:45] would move in hearts, Lord. That you
[23:46] would anoint the ministry, Lord, as they
[23:48] wait on you, Father. You would anoint
[23:49] the musicians and the song leader as
[23:51] they wait, Lord, on you. Pray that Lord,
[23:54] your spirit would just be free to move,
[23:56] Lord. That you would forgive us of all
[23:57] of our shortcomings that nothing would
[23:58] hinder you, Lord, in this service. We
[24:02] ask now that you would be blessed and
[24:04] glorified as we commit it into your
[24:06] hands in Jesus name. Amen.
[24:23] &gt;&gt; Let's give the Lord a hand.
[24:32] Amen. Amen. I think we can do a little
[24:34] bit better than that. Let's give the
[24:35] Lord a great big hand. How many happy in

[1:06:19] believe he comes where he's invited. We
[1:06:21] feel him moving amongst us already
[1:06:23] because there's anticipation,
[1:06:24] expectation on the hearts of the
[1:06:26] believers that they know that the only
[1:06:29] the only thing that can change their
[1:06:31] situation is just a few moments in his
[1:06:34] presence. Amen. No man can change our
[1:06:37] situations or can better our life, but

[1:06:43] Amen. And I know that he's alive and
[1:06:45] he's amongst us. And I believe that he's
[1:06:47] aware of our situations and some of us
[1:06:50] coming from uh different parts of the
[1:06:52] country and all over and maybe some
[1:06:55] carrying some different situations and
[1:06:56] some are happy and some are sad. But
[1:06:59] whatever your situation is, God is the
[1:07:02] God of that situation and he's able able
[1:07:05] to deliver. Amen. We just are glad to be

[1:07:12] Matt for the invitation. and thank you
[1:07:14] for the songs and the wonderful
[1:07:16] specials. Amen.
[1:07:19] Amen. I'm just uh Brother Ronnie, if you
[1:07:22] don't know me, it's an honor to speak to
[1:07:23] you. We're from Truer Tabernacle in
[1:07:24] Bluffton, Ohio. We greet you in the name
[1:07:27] of the Lord. I see some fellow Ohioans
[1:07:28] here and uh Amen. But uh I just love
[1:07:33] this church, the Bethl Tabernacle, and
[1:07:35] the saints here, and we just uh have a
[1:07:37] have a kindred fellowship, and we just
[1:07:39] uh want to put our shoulder to the wheel
[1:07:41] tonight. And you know, I believe that
[1:07:43] the the prophet taught us that there's
[1:07:45] there's such a great power in the heart
[1:07:47] of the believer. And I just look at this
[1:07:49] room and uh just almost overwhelmed with
[1:07:52] the potential that's laying in here
[1:07:54] tonight. If we could just recognize what
[1:07:57] God has put within us. And I wonder
[1:07:59] tonight if we could just use some of
[1:08:01] that power. Maybe you just put your hand
[1:08:02] over on the person next to you tonight.
[1:08:04] And you know, let's bind our faith
[1:08:06] together. These campgrounds have been
[1:08:08] used many times since we were here last
[1:08:10] year. We've seen the power of God move
[1:08:12] upon this stage and move upon the hearts
[1:08:14] of the believers. And it's been used by
[1:08:16] God before, but it's been used for other
[1:08:18] things since then. And let's just
[1:08:20] reclaim this this campground. Let's
[1:08:23] reclaim this sanctuary. Let's let God
[1:08:25] have his dominion over this place that
[1:08:28] all that's said and done would just be
[1:08:29] in perfect order with his word. Amen.
[1:08:32] Let's just bind together. And while
[1:08:33] you're praying for this camp, why don't
[1:08:35] you pray for that person that your hands
[1:08:36] on and just say, "Lord, why don't you
[1:08:38] come by their way? Come by their way in
[1:08:41] this camp. Change their situation.
[1:08:43] Increase their faith and draw them
[1:08:45] closer to you. Father, we just love you
[1:08:46] tonight, Lord. We thank you for your
[1:08:48] grace to us, Father, unmarited favor,
[1:08:51] Lord. That you have, Lord, called us out
[1:08:53] of a nation, Father, called us out of
[1:08:55] the mire of the world, Lord. that
[1:08:57] Father, not to just be Lord uh lukewarm
[1:09:00] Lord or just sitting on the side, but
[1:09:02] Lord, you called us into action, Father.
[1:09:04] Lord, you called us into a position of
[1:09:06] authority, Lord, in this age of the
[1:09:08] opening of the word, Father. Lord, we're
[1:09:10] aware that you're Lord, you've moving
[1:09:12] among your people, Father, Lord, and
[1:09:14] you've desired us to come higher in your
[1:09:16] word. And Father, tonight, I ask that we
[1:09:18] would just, Father, bind our hearts
[1:09:20] together in one accord, Father. Lord,
[1:09:22] that we would, Lord, we would take this
[1:09:24] campground under supreme control of the
[1:09:26] Holy Ghost, Father. Lord, that you would
[1:09:28] just, Father, move across these these
[1:09:30] grounds, Father, may you move in the
[1:09:32] dorms, Father, may you move in the
[1:09:33] outbuildings, Father. Lord, but may you
[1:09:36] move in this sanctuary, Lord, over these
[1:09:38] services, Father. We we have need of
[1:09:40] these places, Father. We have need of
[1:09:42] this pulpit, Lord. We have need of these
[1:09:44] chairs, Father. And Lord, I pray that
[1:09:46] your anointing power, Lord, would just
[1:09:48] move upon every corner, Father. Lord,
[1:09:50] every situation, Father, we become
[1:09:52] subject under your word tonight. For you
[1:09:54] are the God of God and the King of
[1:09:56] Kings, Lord, and there's no thing that
[1:09:58] you cannot do, Father. We bind our
[1:09:59] hearts together, Lord, asking that you
[1:10:01] would just move on the individuals
[1:10:03] gathered here, Lord, that if Lord,
[1:10:05] they've surrendered their time, they've
[1:10:06] surrendered their money, Father, not to
[1:10:08] just see one another, but Lord, that
[1:10:10] they might have communion with you. And
[1:10:12] Father, we know that you're you're
[1:10:14] inhabiting our praises tonight, Lord.
[1:10:16] And we will not cease to give you praise
[1:10:18] over this weekend, Father. I pray that a
[1:10:20] greater liberty would come Lord to every
[1:10:22] individual Lord that is gathered here
[1:10:24] Lord that we could lift up our voice and
[1:10:26] say our God is king Lord. Our God is the
[1:10:29] one who makes a difference. Our God is
[1:10:31] way maker amongst us. Father we
[1:10:33] recognize your presence. We recognize
[1:10:36] you father.
[1:10:38] Lord we give you supreme power Lord. We
[1:10:40] give you control over every situation.
[1:10:43] Father Lord I pray that you just bless
[1:10:45] Father those that are putting their
[1:10:46] shoulders to the wheel. Father, Lord,
[1:10:48] may you anoint every counselor, every
[1:10:51] worker. Father, Lord, may you use every
[1:10:53] every person in a position, Father,
[1:10:55] Lord, to say, Lord, what you would have
[1:10:57] them to say, but Lord, may you bless the
[1:11:00] young people this weekend. I pray,
[1:11:01] Father. Lord, may hearts be open to you,
[1:11:05] Lord. Father, may lives be surrendered,
[1:11:07] Lord.
[1:11:09] Father, we need you. There's never been
[1:11:11] an age like this age, Lord. We need you
[1:11:14] now more than ever, Lord.
[1:11:16] We can't do it without your presence,
[1:11:18] Lord. Father, we don't want to resist
[1:11:21] it, but Lord, we want to embrace it,
[1:11:23] Lord. Let your presence come. Let your
[1:11:25] presence come and move amongst us. We
[1:11:27] pray, Lord, as we open these services,
[1:11:30] Lord, we just look to you, the author of
[1:11:32] this word. We pray in Jesus name. Amen.
[1:11:37] Amen. Hallelujah. If you have your
[1:11:40] scriptures, turn to the book of Romans,

[1:12:17] I'm not going to ask too much of you
[1:12:19] tonight. I I I I'm not going to I'm not
[1:12:21] going to make you think too deep, but I
[1:12:23] just want to present to you a simple
[1:12:25] question uh through the word and uh some
[1:12:27] some some statements through the word.
[1:12:29] And I'm only asking of you one thing.
[1:12:32] I'm just asking for a yes.
[1:12:35] I'm just asking for a yes. So just keep
[1:12:37] that in mind. It's just one word that I
[1:12:38] need from you. A yes. But what saith it?
[1:12:43] The word is nigh thee, even in thy mouth
[1:12:46] and in thy heart. That is the word of
[1:12:48] faith which we preach, that if thou
[1:12:51] shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord
[1:12:53] Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart,
[1:12:56] that God hath raised him from the dead,
[1:12:58] thou shalt be saved. For with the heart
[1:13:01] man believeth unto righteousness, and
[1:13:03] with the mouth confession is made unto
[1:13:06] salvation.
[1:13:08] For the scripture saith, whosoever
[1:13:10] believeth on him shall not be ashamed.
[1:13:13] Amen. May God bless his word. As you
[1:13:14] could be seated tonight. Amen. So with
[1:13:17] the power with the with the power of the
[1:13:19] mouth, confession is made. So there's a
[1:13:21] lot of power that can come out of what
[1:13:23] we can use our mouth for. And and in
[1:13:26] this age, there's a lot of a lot of
[1:13:28] pressure, a lot of influence over us to
[1:13:30] use our opinions or our mouths for other
[1:13:32] things. But I would just like to present
[1:13:35] uh some statements through the word
[1:13:37] tonight that are are are very familiar
[1:13:39] to us. This is going to be a a simple
[1:13:41] thought, but I believe that the Lord has
[1:13:43] directed this to us to just say yes to
[1:13:46] the promises that are coming this
[1:13:48] weekend. This is the opening service.
[1:13:49] This is maybe the the the first service
[1:13:51] of this camp, but it's not your first
[1:13:53] service. you've been in church before
[1:13:54] and you know what the power of God looks
[1:13:56] like and feels like and you know how to
[1:13:58] access that power. And I would say that
[1:14:00] let's not just approach this service or
[1:14:02] this camp like a another tradition or
[1:14:04] another routine, but let's look at this
[1:14:07] from a different perspective than we
[1:14:08] looked at it before to see what what
[1:14:10] could God do in the midst of us if his
[1:14:13] word was open to every individual in
[1:14:16] this room. And I see hearts and I I see
[1:14:18] faith in the building and you might just
[1:14:20] see a you might just see another member
[1:14:21] of your youth group or you might just
[1:14:23] see another person that you long to be
[1:14:24] here at camp with. You might just see a
[1:14:27] a deacon standing in the back. You know
[1:14:28] what but I see from my perspective is I
[1:14:30] see great potential that is laying in
[1:14:33] this room tonight. I believe that if the
[1:14:35] devil if the if the devil uh caught on
[1:14:38] to the power that was within you, he
[1:14:39] wouldn't be plaguing you so bad. And I I
[1:14:41] believe if we knew the potential that we
[1:14:44] carry within us, then we would approach
[1:14:46] life a lot different than to just be
[1:14:47] handed what we're given because we're
[1:14:49] children of the King. Can I can I get a
[1:14:51] yes to that tonight? Are you a child of
[1:14:54] the king? You weren't just put here on
[1:14:56] this earth to fill a seat or to to to
[1:14:59] just come to a church service, but you
[1:15:00] were put here to overthrow the kingdom
[1:15:03] of the devil. You may not recognize
[1:15:05] that. You may not know that tonight, but
[1:15:06] if you'll just continue in this thought
[1:15:08] with me and just say yes to the promises
[1:15:10] of God over your life, you'll recognize
[1:15:12] why you were put here and the purpose
[1:15:14] that God has for you in this time. So, I
[1:15:16] just for a title tonight, I would like
[1:15:18] to speak on the power of yes. The power
[1:15:21] of a yes. If we could just get united
[1:15:23] under the word tonight. You know, in
[1:15:25] this age, there's so many oppressions
[1:15:27] against us and so many pressures. Uh you
[1:15:29] know, you you young people are facing
[1:15:31] things that I never I never faced as a
[1:15:33] young person. You know, I I'm not I'm
[1:15:35] not terribly old, but I'm not young
[1:15:36] either. And so, you have trials. You
[1:15:38] know, I remember I was already I was
[1:15:40] already an adult by the time a
[1:15:41] smartphone came out. And so, I can say
[1:15:43] that you have pressures that I did not
[1:15:45] have as a young person. You have
[1:15:47] temptations that I did not have as a
[1:15:49] young person. You have you have greater
[1:15:51] obstacles to overcome that I did not
[1:15:53] have as a young person. But I say,
[1:15:55] praise God that he sent you anyway
[1:15:57] because he knew what you would have to
[1:16:00] overcome in this age. He knew that there
[1:16:02] would be greater greater temptations. He
[1:16:04] knew that there would be a greater force
[1:16:05] against you. But he sent you to this age
[1:16:07] anyway because God had confidence in you
[1:16:10] that you would be an overcomer in this
[1:16:12] age. And you would not just fall to the
[1:16:14] Leodysian temptations that are in front
[1:16:17] of you, but you would be an overcomer in
[1:16:20] the greatest of ages that there ever
[1:16:22] was. We're not waiting for hell to lift
[1:16:24] off its lid. We're not waiting for a
[1:16:26] great squeeze to come. The great squeeze
[1:16:28] has already been come on the church. the
[1:16:30] great the great oppression of the
[1:16:31] believer has already come to the church.
[1:16:34] Uh can I get an amen in the back? Maybe
[1:16:36] some of you are feeling the pressure
[1:16:37] leading up to this camp. I know what it
[1:16:39] takes to put on a camp and I know the
[1:16:40] pressure that comes behind it and I I
[1:16:42] know all of the feelings involved and I
[1:16:45] know all of the obstacles that you have
[1:16:47] to overcome. But you overcame them
[1:16:48] because you're here and this camp is now
[1:16:51] in session and and what God is doing in
[1:16:53] this camp. The devil tried to stop but
[1:16:56] he could not stop it because God had
[1:16:58] plans for you. You might have thought
[1:16:59] you just jumped on a plane or you just
[1:17:01] decided to come. But God knew you were
[1:17:03] going to be here. He knew what you were
[1:17:04] going to be wearing. He knew what you
[1:17:06] were going to be sitting next to or how
[1:17:07] you were going to feel at this moment of
[1:17:09] time. And God knew that you had an
[1:17:11] appointment to be at this camp during
[1:17:14] these services to receive from something
[1:17:16] from him. Now, some of you might have
[1:17:18] come just to see one another and and
[1:17:19] maybe find a find a significant other,
[1:17:22] but but but God had other plans for you.
[1:17:25] God had a bigger purpose for you that
[1:17:27] you would come and you would dwell under
[1:17:29] the under the opening of his word in
[1:17:32] this age and by that word you would be
[1:17:34] liberated from the oppression of this
[1:17:36] Leodysian age because you are in
[1:17:38] Leodysia but you're not Leoans right you
[1:17:41] are you are in this age but you're not
[1:17:43] of this age you feel different you look
[1:17:45] different you talk different you walk
[1:17:47] different so what makes you different
[1:17:48] it's the word that has been presented
[1:17:51] before you that makes you different
[1:17:53] right this is not just a a a rally to
[1:17:55] come together. This is an ordained
[1:17:58] appointment by God that you would come
[1:18:00] and you would suck with him and he would
[1:18:01] commune with you. And this this this
[1:18:03] these set of services could could exceed
[1:18:06] even what you could imagine that God
[1:18:08] could do. Now, I know this is opening
[1:18:10] night, so I'm not requesting a lot from
[1:18:11] you, but I just want a yes.
[1:18:14] &gt;&gt; I just want a yes that you know that God
[1:18:16] is able to change your situation. And
[1:18:18] you might not know all of the details
[1:18:20] that he's got working in your life, but
[1:18:22] he's able to change the situations. He's
[1:18:25] able to to move across your life. Now,
[1:18:27] the scripture would say this in Isaiah
[1:18:28] 54, "In righteousness shalt thou be
[1:18:30] established. Thou shalt be far from
[1:18:32] oppression. For thou shalt not fear and
[1:18:35] from terror, for it shall not come, it
[1:18:37] shall not come near thee. And behold,
[1:18:39] they shall surely gather together, but
[1:18:41] not by me. Whosoever gatherth together
[1:18:43] against thee shall fall for thy sake. No
[1:18:47] weapon.
[1:18:49] Somebody say no weapon.
[1:18:51] &gt;&gt; No weapon that is formed against thee
[1:18:54] shall prosper. And every tongue that
[1:18:56] shall rise against thee in judgment thou
[1:18:59] shalt condemn. This is the heritage of
[1:19:02] the servants of the Lord. And their
[1:19:04] righteousness is of me, sayaeth the
[1:19:06] Lord. So their righteousness does not
[1:19:08] come from their own works or their own
[1:19:10] abilities, but their righteousness is
[1:19:12] from the Lord. Right? So we're not
[1:19:14] dwelling on whether we're worthy or
[1:19:15] whether we're able. Our righteousness
[1:19:17] comes from God. So it's not based upon
[1:19:19] how good we are. It's based upon how
[1:19:21] good he is. Right? It's not based upon
[1:19:23] how well we can sing. It's based upon
[1:19:25] how worthy of our worship he is. We do
[1:19:28] not come up here. You did not come to
[1:19:29] this camp tonight or come into this
[1:19:31] service to say amen to me.
[1:19:34] &gt;&gt; You came to say amen to a God who is way
[1:19:36] beyond me or way bigger than me. This is
[1:19:38] not about preachers. This is not about
[1:19:40] this is not about just musicians or good
[1:19:42] singers. This is about a God who is
[1:19:44] indwelling in human flesh. And when we
[1:19:47] recognize that this is not about just a
[1:19:48] preacher preaching, this is about a word
[1:19:51] that has come down in our age and it has
[1:19:53] told us who we are, where we came from,
[1:19:55] and where we're going. This is not a
[1:19:57] this is not a message of of big names
[1:19:59] and big authorities. This is a message
[1:20:01] of authority that will use a somebody or
[1:20:04] a nobody to everybody else that nobody
[1:20:06] put their money on you, but God put his
[1:20:09] money on you. God put his name on you
[1:20:10] that you would come here and be an
[1:20:12] overcomer in this age. You might come
[1:20:14] into this camp thinking, "I I'm not
[1:20:16] worth anything. I have no value to me.
[1:20:18] There's no way I could be an overcomer."
[1:20:20] But God says otherwise about you. God
[1:20:22] said that you would be an overcomer in
[1:20:24] this age. God sent you to this end time
[1:20:27] not to be a quitter.
[1:20:29] &gt;&gt; God didn't send you to this end time to
[1:20:31] be to have depression across your back.
[1:20:33] Right? I I believe brother Ram says it
[1:20:35] like this that God has uh Jesus Christ
[1:20:37] himself has sponsored us to be in this
[1:20:40] age. I don't believe I don't believe
[1:20:41] Jesus sponsored us just to be a a
[1:20:44] depressive suicidal person. I don't
[1:20:47] believe Jesus would sponsor that, right?
[1:20:49] I don't believe Jesus would sponsor just
[1:20:51] us to come and fill a seat. Why would he
[1:20:53] why would he sponsor us? You know how
[1:20:54] many in here knows who LeBron James is?
[1:20:59] Come on, Joel. Raise your hand.
[1:21:02] Nike sponsors LeBron James. You know
[1:21:05] what Nike pays LeBron James annually for
[1:21:08] his sponsorship?
[1:21:10] I think it's like $75 million a year and
[1:21:13] he's just wearing the logo of Nike. Why
[1:21:16] would Nike select him to be a sponsor?
[1:21:20] What' you say? He's okay at basketball,
[1:21:22] right? Because they think he's the best,
[1:21:24] right? I'm not going to get into that
[1:21:26] with you guys. They think he's the best.
[1:21:30] They think he's the goat. So, they have
[1:21:32] agreed to sign him up for this contract
[1:21:34] annually because they know how he's
[1:21:36] going to perform. They know what he's
[1:21:38] going to do and they want him to wear
[1:21:40] their logo. Now, they didn't go to just
[1:21:41] anyway. They didn't come to me or Enoch
[1:21:43] and say, "Hey, we we were going to
[1:21:44] sponsor you for $72 million a year." No,
[1:21:46] they put it on the Brown James. Why?
[1:21:47] Because they know he's a winner. They
[1:21:50] didn't just sponsor anybody, but they
[1:21:51] knew he was going to win and he was
[1:21:53] going to represent them well. So when
[1:21:54] Christ sponsored you to come into this
[1:21:56] age, he didn't just put his name on
[1:21:58] anybody, but he put it on you because he
[1:22:00] knew that you were an overcomer. He knew
[1:22:02] that you're a winner. He knew that you
[1:22:04] would overthrow the powers of this age.
[1:22:07] He knew that you would conquer every
[1:22:09] enemy that has come before you. That's
[1:22:12] why he's put his name on you. This is
[1:22:13] not just a church. This is not just a
[1:22:15] meeting. This is a message meeting. This
[1:22:18] is a message camp. This is a message
[1:22:21] gathering. And under the banner of the
[1:22:22] message of the hour, every enemy is
[1:22:25] defeated. I don't care how you feel. I
[1:22:27] don't care how much sin you're currently
[1:22:29] in. This message will triumph over every
[1:22:32] enemy in this age. We are under the
[1:22:35] banner of something greater than our
[1:22:36] individual talent. We are under the
[1:22:38] banner of sponsorship from the one who
[1:22:41] has never lost a battle. He has never
[1:22:43] retreated. He has never backed up. He
[1:22:46] has never had to say, "I'm sorry." He
[1:22:48] has never made the wrong turn. And that
[1:22:50] one is the one who put his name on you.
[1:22:52] I say praise God that he had confidence
[1:22:54] in me when nobody else thought I'd be a
[1:22:56] winner. Christ Almighty sent me to this
[1:22:59] age and said you will be a winner in the
[1:23:02] greatest of ages that there is to them
[1:23:05] that overcome. I believe that's us. I
[1:23:08] believe that's our commission. We did
[1:23:10] not come just to show up. No, we didn't
[1:23:12] I didn't get dressed today. I didn't I
[1:23:14] didn't put on my tie. I didn't drive all
[1:23:16] the way down here just to show up. I
[1:23:18] drove down here to tread on serpents. I
[1:23:21] drove down here to overcome every trial.
[1:23:23] I drove down here to show you that you
[1:23:25] are able to to overcome every temptation
[1:23:28] of this age. Because if he did it for
[1:23:31] me, he can do it for you. If he did it
[1:23:33] for Matt, he can do it for you. If he
[1:23:35] did it for Chris, he can do it for you.
[1:23:37] &gt;&gt; That's just a few examples in the room.
[1:23:39] But we know what we're talking about
[1:23:41] because the same God that overcame in us
[1:23:45] &gt;&gt; will also overcome in you. I believe if
[1:23:48] the devil knew what the power was, he
[1:23:50] would he would have left you a long time
[1:23:51] ago. But when you recognize who you are,
[1:23:54] what you are, what you're sent here for,
[1:23:57] the devil will be powerless before you.
[1:23:59] Right? Is that what the word says?
[1:24:00] Somebody say no weapon.
[1:24:02] &gt;&gt; No weapon.
[1:24:03] &gt;&gt; No weapon.
[1:24:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It doesn't matter what it's
[1:24:07] named. It doesn't matter the the the the
[1:24:09] medical term for it. No weapon
[1:24:12] &gt;&gt; formed against you will prosper.
[1:24:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. And I believe that's great
[1:24:16] confidence for us tonight.
[1:24:18] &gt;&gt; That means that nothing the devil has is
[1:24:20] strong enough to take you out of the
[1:24:22] fight.
[1:24:23] &gt;&gt; That means the greatest the greatest
[1:24:25] battle that you could think of in your
[1:24:26] mind is not strong enough to take you
[1:24:29] out of where God has placed you in this
[1:24:31] age because God thought so much of you
[1:24:33] to send you here. You were not born in
[1:24:34] the age of Luther. You were not born in
[1:24:37] the dark ages. you were born in the
[1:24:38] greatest of ages that there ever was
[1:24:40] where there would be a body change where
[1:24:43] where where you would do something that
[1:24:45] no other group of believers would ever
[1:24:47] do. Now, I'm I'm trying to place you
[1:24:48] here of where you're at in this age. I
[1:24:52] hope we're okay. Are we okay?
[1:24:53] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:24:56] Amen. So, if God had confidence in you,
[1:24:59] shouldn't you have confidence in God to
[1:25:00] overcome? Thank you. Shouldn't you have
[1:25:03] God? Shouldn't you have confidence in
[1:25:04] God that he's able to overcome in your
[1:25:07] situation? God didn't just send you here
[1:25:09] powerless, but God equipped you to
[1:25:11] overcome every enemy that you would face
[1:25:13] in this age. God equipped you that you
[1:25:16] would overcome lust. God equipped you
[1:25:18] that you would overcome depression. God
[1:25:19] equipped you that you would overcome
[1:25:21] anxiety. He did not say that you would
[1:25:22] not fight it, but he equipped that you
[1:25:24] would overcome it. He gave you
[1:25:26] everything that you need to overcome it.
[1:25:29] Because greater is he that is in you
[1:25:30] than he that is in the world. Greater is
[1:25:33] the anointing that dwells within you
[1:25:34] already than he that is that is that is
[1:25:37] the ruler of this age. But God has sent
[1:25:40] us here as overcomers, not as quitters.
[1:25:43] There's no quit in the material that you
[1:25:45] were made out of. God sent you here as
[1:25:48] an overcomer of every trial in this age.
[1:25:52] You will overcome because greater is he
[1:25:54] that sent you than he that is in the
[1:25:56] world. He He that is in you is greater.
[1:26:00] Can you say yes to that tonight?
[1:26:02] &gt;&gt; Yes to that tonight.
[1:26:04] &gt;&gt; You see, it depends on whose influence
[1:26:06] you're going to be under. The devil
[1:26:07] would like to keep you under the
[1:26:08] influence that you're not going to make
[1:26:09] it. You're not going to succeed. You're
[1:26:12] never going to live a life outside of
[1:26:13] anxiety.
[1:26:16] &gt;&gt; But the devil is a liar.
[1:26:19] &gt;&gt; The devil has no credibility to his
[1:26:21] voice. He only has the power that you
[1:26:24] loan him. He only has the power that you
[1:26:27] allow him to access in your mind. And so
[1:26:29] instead of believing the devil's lies,
[1:26:31] why don't we say yes to the promises of
[1:26:33] God tonight that would tell us that we
[1:26:35] are overcomers, that we are free in him,
[1:26:38] that we do have precious peace that is
[1:26:40] beyond our understanding, that we do
[1:26:42] have access to all of these blessings of
[1:26:44] God. You see, the influence that we're
[1:26:45] under will determine our outcome, right?
[1:26:49] &gt;&gt; Because we've got to get away from the
[1:26:51] from the lies of the enemy. The lies of
[1:26:53] the enemy will keep you down in in in a
[1:26:56] leodyian mud trying to struggle for
[1:26:58] life. But the word has come and told us
[1:27:02] you are free. You are under the spirit
[1:27:04] of Christ. And where the spirit of
[1:27:06] Christ is, there is liberty. There is
[1:27:10] freedom. There is absolute freedom from
[1:27:13] every oppression. And I believe the
[1:27:14] spirit of Christ is in this message. I
[1:27:17] believe this message is the spirit of
[1:27:19] liberty. And any spirit that would try
[1:27:21] to take the liberty from you is not of
[1:27:23] God. But it's easy to discern. It must
[1:27:26] be the devil lying to me because God
[1:27:28] said, "I'm free."
[1:27:30] &gt;&gt; Christ did not open this word to us in
[1:27:32] this age and reveal who we are to tell
[1:27:33] us that we were not going to make it.
[1:27:35] Brother Matt, he didn't go through all
[1:27:37] that to tell us that we just weren't
[1:27:38] going to have enough at the end time.
[1:27:40] But God so thoroughly vindicated this
[1:27:42] message in this age and rose up a
[1:27:44] Kentucky hillbilly and kept him from
[1:27:45] women and kept him from money and kept
[1:27:47] him from the reproach of the world. Why?
[1:27:49] So that we could be a quitter or we
[1:27:51] could be a loser? No. So we could be an
[1:27:53] overcomer.
[1:27:55] &gt;&gt; He's opened the word to us. It has
[1:27:57] identified who we are in this age. It's
[1:27:59] identified your name. It's called you by
[1:28:02] name. And it did not call you a loser of
[1:28:04] Leodysia. It called you an overcomer
[1:28:08] because you were born to win. You were
[1:28:10] sent here to overthrow the kingdom of
[1:28:12] the enemy. Now, I want to remind you the
[1:28:14] potential that's within you is greater
[1:28:17] than you recognize.
[1:28:18] &gt;&gt; You know what the word potential means?
[1:28:20] It means stored up energy. So, there's
[1:28:23] something that God sent here before
[1:28:24] there ever was a trial. You already had
[1:28:26] potential
[1:28:29] &gt;&gt; before there ever was before your
[1:28:30] grandpa ever took his first breath. You
[1:28:33] are already sent here with potential
[1:28:35] because God's not surprised that you're
[1:28:36] here. Nor is God surprised that you're
[1:28:38] going through the struggle that you're
[1:28:39] going through. God knew you would be
[1:28:42] going through the struggle that you're
[1:28:43] going through and he equipped you to
[1:28:45] overcome it. He sent his word to you and
[1:28:48] his word has equipped you to overcome
[1:28:51] every trial of this age. What is this in
[1:28:55] your hand,
[1:28:56] &gt;&gt; friend? I don't know what the message is
[1:28:58] to you, but I know what it is to me.
[1:29:00] What is this in your hand? Is it just
[1:29:02] something that we just quote back and
[1:29:03] forth and we argue with one another back
[1:29:05] and forth? Or is this the king's sword?
[1:29:07] I believe it's the sword of the king
[1:29:09] that has come down in the camp. And I
[1:29:11] believe it's time to put it to work. I
[1:29:13] believe it's time to draw the sword of
[1:29:14] the king and go to attack against the
[1:29:17] against the enemy in this age.
[1:29:18] Hallelujah. I believe that there's still
[1:29:21] some standing here.
[1:29:23] All right.
[1:29:24] &gt;&gt; You may not have any fight in you when
[1:29:26] you showed up tonight, but I pray by the
[1:29:27] end of this weekend there's a renewed
[1:29:29] fight in you that you are raised up to
[1:29:32] the place where you could draw the
[1:29:34] king's sword out of the sheath and put
[1:29:36] it to work. This is not a message of
[1:29:38] just quotes. This is not a message of
[1:29:40] camps. This is an action message. This
[1:29:43] is a faith in the word that release will
[1:29:46] put you in the plan of God.
[1:29:49] &gt;&gt; We've got to release it, though. Can you
[1:29:51] say yes to that?
[1:29:53] &gt;&gt; Can you say yes to that?
[1:29:55] &gt;&gt; That this word was not meant to just
[1:29:56] dwell on paper.
[1:29:59] &gt;&gt; This this this message wasn't sent here
[1:30:01] so a couple of big preachers could argue
[1:30:03] about what it means. This message was
[1:30:05] sent here to liberate the captive this
[1:30:08] day. This scripture is fulfilled in your
[1:30:11] ears. You got to recognize the season
[1:30:13] that you're in. Friend, we are in
[1:30:15] another season than just Luther's age or
[1:30:17] Wesley's age or the Pentecostal Isuza
[1:30:20] revival. We have all of the word. And
[1:30:23] all of the word comes with all of its
[1:30:25] benefits.
[1:30:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:30:28] &gt;&gt; We're not tied down to one opinion or
[1:30:29] the other. We are walking in the middle
[1:30:31] of the road with the word.
[1:30:33] &gt;&gt; Sometimes I worry that the young people
[1:30:35] maybe feel like Peter in prison. Right.
[1:30:37] Right, brother Joel? They're strapped
[1:30:39] between two prisoners. one being the
[1:30:42] formal side and one being the fanatical
[1:30:44] side, right? Well, you feel like, well,
[1:30:47] if I get too fanatical, then I might be
[1:30:49] considered a Pentecostal,
[1:30:51] &gt;&gt; but then you feel like, I hope you're
[1:30:52] okay. And then you feel like you got the
[1:30:54] you know, we we've got the revelated
[1:30:55] word, so I mean be more mature than
[1:30:57] that.
[1:30:59] &gt;&gt; But the the prophet taught us that you
[1:31:01] take all of what was in those former
[1:31:03] ages and you bring them into the current
[1:31:05] position of the word, right? You don't
[1:31:06] throw away that. You take all that that
[1:31:09] was. So what that does for me is when
[1:31:11] this word opened to me and it revealed
[1:31:13] to me who I was, brother Levi, there was
[1:31:15] no chain strong enough to hold me down.
[1:31:17] There was no I didn't care who was
[1:31:19] looking. I didn't care who was around
[1:31:21] because I was headed for nowhere. And
[1:31:23] when this word became open to me, it
[1:31:26] identified me as an overcomer in this
[1:31:28] age. How could I keep quiet? How could I
[1:31:31] keep silent? How could I how could I
[1:31:33] restrain myself from worshiping a God
[1:31:36] who would identify that I am an eternal
[1:31:38] being? Hallelujah.
[1:31:41] &gt;&gt; There's no greater knowledge than that
[1:31:43] to know that you came from God and
[1:31:45] you're going back to God. So this is
[1:31:47] just a trial of our life. This is not
[1:31:50] the end of your story. And when you see
[1:31:52] this word is open to you and you
[1:31:54] recognize who you are, you see that your
[1:31:56] story does not end here.
[1:31:59] But you will keep going on and on and
[1:32:02] on. And when the tempter that has been
[1:32:03] tormenting your life ceases to exist,
[1:32:06] you will still be going on in glory. You
[1:32:08] will still be worshiping God. You will
[1:32:11] not have an end because you never had a
[1:32:13] beginning. How could we keep quiet when
[1:32:15] this message has been open to us? It
[1:32:17] identifies who we are.
[1:32:20] &gt;&gt; This is who we are, friends. This is why
[1:32:23] we believe what we believe. I believe we
[1:32:25] have the the revealing of the word and I
[1:32:27] believe we can rejoice about it. I
[1:32:30] believe that we have a power that is
[1:32:31] opened up to in this age and I know that
[1:32:33] Christ is the mystery of God revealed
[1:32:35] and I believe that he that is in you is
[1:32:38] the hope of glory
[1:32:40] &gt;&gt; and I think we should be able to rejoice
[1:32:42] about it. I think we ought to be able to
[1:32:44] give God praise about it. I don't think
[1:32:45] we should be confined to one one side or
[1:32:47] the other. I think we should walk with
[1:32:49] the word in step with liberty. Right?
[1:32:51] Because if any spirit tries to bring you
[1:32:53] subject under their opinion or their
[1:32:55] idea of the scripture, then it's easy to
[1:32:57] identify it's not God's promise. This
[1:33:01] doesn't take great discernment, friends.
[1:33:03] You've got enough discernment within you
[1:33:04] to understand what is God and what is
[1:33:06] not. God never told you that you were
[1:33:08] not going to make it.
[1:33:12] Doesn't take great discernment. You
[1:33:14] don't have to raise your hand, but how
[1:33:15] many people have ever had the thought
[1:33:16] that you're not going to make the
[1:33:17] rapture?
[1:33:20] Well, God didn't give you that thought.
[1:33:22] Where'd that thought come from? It
[1:33:24] wasn't your thought, but it came from
[1:33:26] another source. It came from something
[1:33:29] outside the true word of God. Right? And
[1:33:32] it put that thought within you. Now, the
[1:33:33] only power that that thought has is what
[1:33:36] you give it. If you say yes to that
[1:33:38] thought, you'll enter into depression,
[1:33:40] and you'll enter into into
[1:33:41] sorrowfulness, and you enter into
[1:33:42] anxiety. You'll enter into wondering if
[1:33:44] you're going to make it. You'll enter
[1:33:45] into an up and down relationship with
[1:33:47] God from camp to camp and have no
[1:33:49] experience with God and you'll be up and
[1:33:52] down in your Christian relationship. But
[1:33:53] if you reject that thought and you say
[1:33:56] yes to the fact that you are chosen, you
[1:33:58] are elected. You are the apple of God's
[1:34:01] eye. Then that is already a no. You
[1:34:03] can't miss the rapture when you said yes
[1:34:05] to this. So there's power that comes
[1:34:07] when you say yes. There's power that
[1:34:10] comes with understanding why you've been
[1:34:12] put here on this earth. It was not just
[1:34:14] to fill a seat, but it requires some
[1:34:15] input from you. I know that that there
[1:34:17] are situations that we go through in
[1:34:19] life and we're solely dependent upon
[1:34:21] God's strength in our life. But
[1:34:24] sometimes he just wants a yes from you.
[1:34:28] Sometimes he just wants you to agree
[1:34:30] with his word. The power of confession
[1:34:32] of his word that yes, I want you to
[1:34:35] lead. There's many there is many
[1:34:37] influences trying to take the leadership
[1:34:39] of the young people in this age. But we
[1:34:42] have the true leader.
[1:34:44] Remember Jesus would come to the rich
[1:34:46] young ruler and he would he would tell
[1:34:47] him what a good Christian he was. What a
[1:34:49] what a powerful Sunday school student he
[1:34:51] was. How he he could he could quote the
[1:34:53] scripture and he could do all these
[1:34:54] things and he had an intellectual
[1:34:56] understanding of the message.
[1:35:00] But when it came time to say yes and
[1:35:02] make a commitment, one thing that thou
[1:35:05] lackest to make that final commitment
[1:35:08] with the word that this is the divine
[1:35:11] leadership in this age. We cannot be
[1:35:13] halt between two opin opinions anymore.
[1:35:16] But we've got to have a revelation to
[1:35:17] know this is the unadulterated truth of
[1:35:20] the hour. Can I get a yes? Can I get a
[1:35:23] yes? How many how many how many people
[1:35:24] have have received the power of this
[1:35:26] word in this age and it changed your
[1:35:28] life? Brother Chris, he's a he's a
[1:35:29] witness. Brother Brother Matt is a
[1:35:32] witness. There's other people that are
[1:35:33] witnesses in here. I wonder how many
[1:35:34] people I know we got some older ones in
[1:35:35] the back. How many of you has God
[1:35:37] changed your life from the trajectory
[1:35:38] that you were headed? Look at the
[1:35:40] witnesses that we have that said yes to
[1:35:42] the word of God and their entire life
[1:35:44] was changed in a moment in just an
[1:35:47] experience with God. And they were
[1:35:48] headed one way. They were headed for
[1:35:50] drugs. They were headed for a life of
[1:35:52] sin and shame. But just one moment they
[1:35:54] said yes to the right moment at the
[1:35:56] right time. and their entire trajectory
[1:35:59] was changed. We've got some witnesses
[1:36:01] tonight that know that the power of yes
[1:36:03] is able to change your entire trajectory
[1:36:06] in life. You maybe think you're headed
[1:36:08] this way, but if you say yes to a
[1:36:10] promise of God, you will reject the
[1:36:12] filth of this world and you will go on
[1:36:14] into the promises of God. He has
[1:36:16] predestinated you as an overcomer in
[1:36:19] this age. He's just waiting for you to
[1:36:21] say yes, Lord.
[1:36:22] &gt;&gt; Brother would ask the question, do I
[1:36:24] have any Isaiah's in the building
[1:36:26] tonight? Is there any Isaiah that could
[1:36:28] say I am Isaiah. I am Isaiah. How about
[1:36:32] some Davids?
[1:36:34] &gt;&gt; How about some Davids? Can we say I am
[1:36:36] David? Let's look at David for a minute.
[1:36:39] I'm just going to preach. I got quotes
[1:36:40] and stuff. We'll just preach. It's
[1:36:41] opening night.
[1:36:43] &gt;&gt; How many Davids?
[1:36:45] &gt;&gt; You know that David's own dad didn't
[1:36:47] even bet on him to win.
[1:36:50] &gt;&gt; He tried to offer every other kid he
[1:36:52] had.
[1:36:53] &gt;&gt; Take this one. Anoint this one. Anoint
[1:36:55] this one. This one's taller. This one's
[1:36:56] handsomemer.
[1:36:58] &gt;&gt; This one's stronger. David's own dad
[1:37:01] didn't even bet on him to win.
[1:37:03] &gt;&gt; But the Lord had other plans for David.
[1:37:06] And when David's name was called, you
[1:37:08] know what he was doing? He was working
[1:37:09] in the field.
[1:37:12] And he said yes.
[1:37:14] &gt;&gt; He responded to the call. And that
[1:37:16] prophet anointed him. When nobody else
[1:37:19] had their eye on David, God already knew
[1:37:21] where David was. He was small in
[1:37:23] stature. Nobody thought he was a winner.
[1:37:25] And maybe nobody thought in your entire
[1:37:27] youth group, they're thinking, "It can't
[1:37:28] be that person. Maybe it won't be that
[1:37:30] person." But God knows who you are and
[1:37:33] he knows how to get your attention. All
[1:37:35] you need to do is say, "Yes. Yes, Lord.
[1:37:38] Yes, Lord. Yes, I I agree. Yes, I
[1:37:41] accept. Yes, I want that. Yes, I want a
[1:37:43] victorious life." And when you say yes
[1:37:46] to a victorious life, you're saying no
[1:37:48] to a defeated devil.
[1:37:51] &gt;&gt; He's just looking for a yes.
[1:37:55] We have any do we have any Paul's?
[1:37:58] I am Paul.
[1:38:02] A true leader that would forsake all
[1:38:05] that he knew.
[1:38:08] And an interaction with the light that
[1:38:10] he would say yes to.
[1:38:13] You know that light is here in our midst
[1:38:15] tonight.
[1:38:17] It didn't it didn't go away in 1965.
[1:38:21] That light is very much wherever this
[1:38:23] message is preached, the angel of the
[1:38:26] Lord accompanies it always. Is that what
[1:38:29] it says, brothers? Always. That means
[1:38:30] wherever this message is preached, that
[1:38:32] light is here. Wherever this message is
[1:38:35] preached, that angel anointing is here.
[1:38:36] We're not waiting for something to come.
[1:38:38] We're not in anticipation for the
[1:38:40] bride's revival to break. The bride's
[1:38:42] revival has already broken. This is the
[1:38:44] yes that I'm talking about. The bride's
[1:38:46] revival is open to you if you want to
[1:38:49] enter into it. You just got to say yes
[1:38:51] tonight. Hallelujah.
[1:38:54] There's no greater yes that you'll ever
[1:38:56] have in your life. Is Gideon in here,
[1:38:58] Watkins? Yeah. Somewhere. Okay. Last
[1:39:01] year I was here. He was he was uh just
[1:39:04] just had his eye on somebody. Right.
[1:39:07] Shortly after that, he had to ask her a
[1:39:10] question and she said yes. But when she
[1:39:14] said yes, it was a no to everybody else.
[1:39:20] When she said yes to him, it was a no.
[1:39:23] Sorry, boys. It was a no to all you
[1:39:25] other boys.
[1:39:27] &gt;&gt; Because one yes can be a thousand nos.
[1:39:32] &gt;&gt; And when you say yes to the promises of
[1:39:34] God that have come into this age, you're
[1:39:36] saying no. You're rejecting the filth of
[1:39:38] this age. You're rejecting pornography.
[1:39:41] You're rejecting suicide. You're
[1:39:43] rejecting anxiety. You're rejecting the
[1:39:45] lust of the flesh. You're rejecting
[1:39:47] depression. When you say yes to the
[1:39:49] promise of God, you are saying no to the
[1:39:51] devil in his field. I say yes, Lord. I
[1:39:54] say yes. Yes. Let your promise be
[1:39:58] fulfilled in me, Lord. I say yes. Let
[1:40:00] your promise be yay and amen in my life.
[1:40:04] I say yes, Lord. Let this be more than
[1:40:06] just my daddy's religion or my pastor's
[1:40:09] religion. Let this be a me message. This
[1:40:12] is a message of you can too.
[1:40:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. If David can trust him, then
[1:40:16] you can too.
[1:40:18] &gt;&gt; David trusted him so much, he put his
[1:40:20] future in his hands.
[1:40:23] &gt;&gt; Can you do the same thing?
[1:40:26] Puts your future in the hands of God.
[1:40:28] You know what that does for you? I'm
[1:40:29] just going to I'm just going to whack at
[1:40:30] this devil again. It drives the anxiety
[1:40:32] out of you because you know it's not
[1:40:34] based on something you can change or
[1:40:36] something you can do. But you have
[1:40:38] surrendered your own ability to the one
[1:40:40] who's got it all in control. Hallelujah.
[1:40:43] He's the alpha. He's the omega. And he's
[1:40:47] in the middle,
[1:40:48] &gt;&gt; which means he's got your life in
[1:40:50] control.
[1:40:54] Amen. All right. Are we good?
[1:40:58] &gt;&gt; You know, I think I think we need to I
[1:41:00] need I think we need to look at where
[1:41:01] we're getting our influences from. Any
[1:41:04] influence that would try to keep you
[1:41:06] down, like Uzziah, right, in the
[1:41:08] scripture. And in the year King Uzziah
[1:41:10] died, that's when Isaiah started his
[1:41:13] ministry. That's when everything took
[1:41:15] off for Isaiah. Why? Because there was a
[1:41:16] weight that was on top of him, right?
[1:41:18] You can't grow if you've got somebody
[1:41:21] else's influence on top of you.
[1:41:23] &gt;&gt; It's like a corn where we come from,
[1:41:24] there's corn coming out of the ground,
[1:41:25] right? All over the place. But I noticed
[1:41:27] where there's a rock sitting, there's no
[1:41:29] corn growing up. But it'll try to it'll
[1:41:30] a stock of it'll try to come out from
[1:41:32] underneath that rock, right?
[1:41:34] But what has to happen is you got to
[1:41:36] move the rock. You got to take the
[1:41:38] weight off the life and allow that stock
[1:41:41] to come up into liberty, right? Get some
[1:41:43] rain on it, get some sunshine on it, get
[1:41:45] some freedom on it, and then then that
[1:41:48] stock will come to life and it will
[1:41:49] produce fruit, right? So, you got to get
[1:41:51] Uzziah out of your life. And that's the
[1:41:54] enemy trying to tell you that you're not
[1:41:56] going to make it. You're just a you're
[1:41:57] just a make believer.
[1:42:00] You're just here for the go-karts.
[1:42:05] We can go faster tonight than the
[1:42:06] go-karts can take you if you want to.
[1:42:09] &gt;&gt; We don't got to wait till they open
[1:42:10] tomorrow. We can have a good time
[1:42:11] without go-karts.
[1:42:13] &gt;&gt; I think if we can scream and we can
[1:42:14] shout on the go-kart track, then we
[1:42:15] ought to be able to rejoice that our
[1:42:17] names are written in the book of heaven
[1:42:19] and there is no end to us. I think
[1:42:22] that's a real reason to give God praise.
[1:42:24] And to think about a God that would do
[1:42:26] so much for you and yet I know how I
[1:42:28] feel that I've done so little for him. I
[1:42:31] think I I I just think how how little
[1:42:33] have I done for God at my age, in my
[1:42:35] time. And I can imagine what a young
[1:42:36] person thinks. But I want to encourage
[1:42:38] you tonight. There is something you can
[1:42:40] do for God.
[1:42:42] &gt;&gt; You can say yes.
[1:42:44] &gt;&gt; You can say yes to his will and his word
[1:42:46] in your life. And that is doing
[1:42:48] something for God. You know, one time
[1:42:50] there was a king in the scripture who
[1:42:52] was thirsty. Hallelujah. I know if I
[1:42:54] said I was thirsty right now, maybe
[1:42:56] somebody would run up and get me a
[1:42:57] bottle of water and there'd be no
[1:42:58] problem. Here you go. Glad we can serve
[1:42:59] you. Brother Jason said, "Hey, I'm
[1:43:01] thirsty." Somebody go get him a bottle
[1:43:02] of water. Right. Well, how much more the
[1:43:04] King of Kings, the one who has paid the
[1:43:06] price for our sins, that has brought us
[1:43:08] out of the mire of this world and given
[1:43:10] us eternal life, a pathway to victory.
[1:43:13] How much more would we get him a drink
[1:43:14] of water if he asked us for something
[1:43:16] tonight?
[1:43:17] &gt;&gt; You know, in the scripture one time,
[1:43:18] there was a king that was thirsty and
[1:43:20] his men said, "Your wish is our command.
[1:43:22] Whatever you require of us, we will do.
[1:43:25] We will cut through denominational
[1:43:26] spirits. We will cut through Leodysian
[1:43:28] attitudes. We will cut through the fear
[1:43:30] of this world to give our king a drink.
[1:43:32] I wonder how many of you would say yes.
[1:43:36] &gt;&gt; Oh, come on, friends. Yes.
[1:43:40] You think we think if if if if God came
[1:43:42] in here tonight, right? Let's just say
[1:43:44] let's just say that Jesus is going to
[1:43:46] come in here tonight and we're going to
[1:43:48] offer him a chair. This is just
[1:43:50] spontaneous now. This is free.
[1:43:52] &gt;&gt; And we're going to offer him a seat. We
[1:43:55] would say, "No, take my seat. No, take
[1:43:56] mine. No, take the cushion seat. No,
[1:43:59] take the more comfortable seat. Take
[1:44:01] take here, here, here. Is there
[1:44:02] something I can get you? Do you want a
[1:44:04] slushie? Is there something I can do for
[1:44:06] you? Right? Because we want to serve
[1:44:07] him. But yet, we'll come to church
[1:44:10] service after service. And he's asked us
[1:44:12] to do something. And we won't do it for
[1:44:14] him because we're unaware of the
[1:44:16] presence that's in the room with us.
[1:44:18] This is not just another service. This
[1:44:19] is not just another camp. This is not
[1:44:21] just another set of meetings. This is a
[1:44:23] changing of your life. This is taking
[1:44:25] your yes one way and saying no to all
[1:44:28] that. This is a changing of times. I I I
[1:44:32] wish that you could see the potential
[1:44:33] that's within. You might see, well, I'm
[1:44:35] I'm brother, if you knew me, I'm just a
[1:44:36] weak Christian. I know I am, too. But
[1:44:38] the God that's in me is greater than the
[1:44:41] situation in my life. The God that's in
[1:44:43] me is more powerful than any
[1:44:45] circumstance that I am facing tonight.
[1:44:48] He that I have surrendered myself to is
[1:44:51] greater than the challenges of this age.
[1:44:55] Brother Bam said that there was three
[1:44:57] men that went to get that water for him.
[1:44:59] Let me tell you where you are in this
[1:45:00] story. Brother Tony had a sword tonight.
[1:45:04] He cut away all the sleepiness, all the
[1:45:06] tired eyes, all the roadweary warriors.
[1:45:08] He took a sword out. I've got the other
[1:45:11] sword tonight. There's only two swords
[1:45:13] in this fight, right? So what do you got
[1:45:16] to do? You've got a bucket.
[1:45:20] Surely you would get a drink for the
[1:45:22] king. Surely you would. You would give
[1:45:24] him some water if he was thirsty. Right
[1:45:26] now, we've already cut down the
[1:45:28] denominational spirits around us. And
[1:45:30] the word is currently cutting it down.
[1:45:32] So, you've got an open bucket tonight.
[1:45:34] The power of Yes. And if you'll take
[1:45:36] that bucket out and you'll go and run to
[1:45:39] the well, you know what that bucket
[1:45:40] represents? It represents your praise
[1:45:42] and your worship. But you got to take
[1:45:43] that bucket all the way to the well of
[1:45:45] Bethlehem. You got to fill it up with
[1:45:47] that Pentecostal water that he desires.
[1:45:49] And you got to run it back to camp. You
[1:45:51] got to run it back to the one that has a
[1:45:53] has a thirst in your life. If God asked
[1:45:55] you for something, you would no doubt
[1:45:56] say yes. Right?
[1:45:59] &gt;&gt; Can I get a yes?
[1:46:01] &gt;&gt; So, he's asked you to take this bucket
[1:46:03] and to pour out your praise upon him.
[1:46:07] &gt;&gt; We're not praising a song leader
[1:46:09] tonight.
[1:46:11] We're not praising the songs that we're
[1:46:13] singing. We're not just praising because
[1:46:16] we sound good.
[1:46:18] I sound terrible and ain't no rock ever
[1:46:21] going to steal my praise because I know
[1:46:23] why I was put on this earth. I know the
[1:46:25] commission that I was sent here. I know
[1:46:27] that when I was unlovable, he loved me.
[1:46:30] I know that when I had no future, he
[1:46:32] gave me eternal life and shown me who I
[1:46:34] was in his word. I know that there was
[1:46:36] no way for me to succeed. And he said
[1:46:39] that I have called you. I have chosen
[1:46:41] you. So, how could I withhold my praise?
[1:46:44] Hallelujah. Don't tell me to be quiet
[1:46:47] cuz you weren't in the hole I was in.
[1:46:50] &gt;&gt; But if you recognize the hole that he
[1:46:52] brought you out of, you could not cease
[1:46:54] giving him praise. He's worthy of every
[1:46:56] breath we could breathe. Worthy of every
[1:46:59] song we could sing. We're not singing to
[1:47:01] just some pulpit or some some some some
[1:47:03] man singing. We're singing to the King
[1:47:05] of Kings.
[1:47:07] This is why we sing, friends. Why is
[1:47:09] there a war over that today?
[1:47:12] because Satan wants to rob you from your
[1:47:15] position.
[1:47:18] But I believe it's time you say yes.
[1:47:21] Yes to the word of God. Yes to the
[1:47:25] promises of this age. Yes to the
[1:47:27] promises of the word that we're living
[1:47:29] under. That age that you're living in
[1:47:31] and the message of this age, it's got to
[1:47:33] be brought out of the scriptures and
[1:47:34] vindicated and proved by God that it's
[1:47:36] God doing so. Then you either receive
[1:47:39] that or reject it. That's eternal life.
[1:47:41] The leadership of the Holy Spirit, we
[1:47:43] must follow him is the only way to have
[1:47:46] eternal life. So the leadership of God
[1:47:48] is to follow the vindicated word of the
[1:47:50] hour by the Holy Ghost. Can I say that
[1:47:54] again? By the Holy Ghost. This was in uh
[1:47:57] uh 65 if you're wondering.
[1:48:00] By the Holy Ghost. He did not send us
[1:48:03] here to build another church
[1:48:06] or to another organization. He sent us
[1:48:09] here to be powerhouses
[1:48:12] &gt;&gt; raised up into the stature of Jesus
[1:48:14] Christ. Now you tell me what kind of
[1:48:16] powerhouse will drag themselves into
[1:48:18] church. Oh buddy, don't beat us up. It's
[1:48:21] opening night.
[1:48:24] But I just want you to say yes to the
[1:48:26] potential. There's some powerful men of
[1:48:28] God that are coming behind me. And if I
[1:48:31] can just get you to say yes tonight,
[1:48:35] &gt;&gt; then you are saying no to all of the
[1:48:37] filth of this world that will try to
[1:48:39] follow you in here tomorrow night. If
[1:48:41] you can say yes tonight to the promises
[1:48:43] of God, you're not waiting to be
[1:48:45] resurrected. This message has already
[1:48:46] resurrected us. We're already
[1:48:49] resurrected. But a lot of us are like
[1:48:51] Lazarus was when he came out of the
[1:48:52] grave. And we've got to do some
[1:48:54] changing.
[1:48:55] &gt;&gt; The word is powerful, more powerful,
[1:48:57] sharper than any two-edged sword. It's
[1:48:59] already resurrected us to life. But we
[1:49:01] got to change our clothes.
[1:49:04] &gt;&gt; Religion stinks, friends.
[1:49:08] Just leodys and worship. It stinks in
[1:49:09] God's nostrils.
[1:49:12] But he loosed him
[1:49:14] by the power of the word. Why would God
[1:49:17] loose him? Because you can't praise
[1:49:19] being bound. You can't worship him being
[1:49:22] bound. You can't worship him when your
[1:49:24] hands are tied down. So, you've got to
[1:49:26] get the influence of condemnation off of
[1:49:28] you and you've got to move into the
[1:49:30] promises of God that has liberated you
[1:49:32] to be a worshipper in this age. He is
[1:49:35] seeking those. Right? This is something
[1:49:36] else he's looking for.
[1:49:39] &gt;&gt; Can you be a worshipper in spirit and
[1:49:40] truth?
[1:49:42] &gt;&gt; Yes. Anybody? Can I get a yes? Can you
[1:49:44] worship him in spirit and in truth? Can
[1:49:46] I get a yes, somebody?
[1:49:50] &gt;&gt; He's looking for it. He's seeking it.
[1:49:52] You think it'd be easy for him to find,
[1:49:53] but it's not easy for for him to find
[1:49:55] because it takes somebody to surrender
[1:49:57] themselves and move beyond how they
[1:49:59] feel, what they see, how they how they
[1:50:01] how they how they view themselves and
[1:50:03] move into the promises of God. There's a
[1:50:06] law that comes with God's word. And
[1:50:09] you've got to recognize that you are
[1:50:10] under a dispensation of a word that's
[1:50:13] more powerful than even even your own
[1:50:15] understanding.
[1:50:17] I'm going to read this out of
[1:50:18] expectation. I'm not going to preach all
[1:50:20] night. Just a yes. That's all I'm
[1:50:21] looking for. Just a yes. You know the
[1:50:24] power of your voice.
[1:50:29] I think too many of us have let the the
[1:50:31] voice of our worry
[1:50:34] become louder than the voice of our
[1:50:36] praise.
[1:50:38] We've let the voice of our of our
[1:50:39] anxieties become louder than the voice
[1:50:42] of our amens to the word of God. That
[1:50:44] he's got it in control. We've let the
[1:50:47] voice of of some influencer or some some
[1:50:50] some uh uh social media expert become
[1:50:53] louder than the voice of the message in
[1:50:54] our car.
[1:50:57] We've let we've let the voice of
[1:50:58] Leodysia become louder than the voice of
[1:51:01] the promises of God in this age. But
[1:51:03] tonight, you can change that by just
[1:51:05] saying yes. The power of yes. Now, for
[1:51:08] instance, if you was up here back behind
[1:51:10] some of these big dark mountains
[1:51:12] tonight, it was so black and dark down
[1:51:13] there and you couldn't see where you
[1:51:14] were going. You might fall over a rock
[1:51:16] or step into a snake or you didn't know
[1:51:18] what was going to happen and one of
[1:51:19] these big hila monsters or something
[1:51:20] laying up there and you know electricity
[1:51:22] is all around you. You could scream till
[1:51:23] you got horse. Oh, electricity,
[1:51:25] electricity, light up. How many's ever
[1:51:28] been crying out to God in the middle of
[1:51:29] your great situation. Sometimes that's
[1:51:32] the only place that we that we remember
[1:51:35] he's even with us is in our greatest
[1:51:37] trial. We'll cry out to God. Oh,
[1:51:40] electricity, electricity, light up. Show
[1:51:42] me to get how to get out of here. I know
[1:51:43] you're here. I know you're here. It's
[1:51:45] scientifically proven that you're here.
[1:51:47] So, light up. You could scream till you
[1:51:49] got horse and it would never light up.
[1:51:51] Why? Electricity will light if you
[1:51:53] follow the law of electricity. But
[1:51:56] you've got to follow the laws of
[1:51:57] electricity. If you had a fountain over
[1:51:59] on this side, an artisian well gushing
[1:52:01] up, and a crop over on this side burning
[1:52:02] up. Now, you could say, "Oh, water, go
[1:52:04] over here and irrigate my crop." It
[1:52:06] wouldn't do it. No. But if you'll follow
[1:52:07] the laws of gravitation, you can make it
[1:52:10] do it. Is that right? When I look, God
[1:52:11] is here this afternoon and we've got to
[1:52:14] follow the law of God. The law of God is
[1:52:16] one accord. Love for one another. He
[1:52:18] that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God
[1:52:20] believeth, hopeeth all things, trust in
[1:52:22] all things, to do with all things. There
[1:52:24] you are. One accord. Everybody under
[1:52:26] expectation that God's going to pour
[1:52:28] down his power. Can you say yes tonight?
[1:52:32] &gt;&gt; You know it's here. Scientifically, you
[1:52:34] know it's here. Lookie, how could Mrs.
[1:52:35] Waldrup be sitting here and dying of
[1:52:36] cancer? How many across the world? a
[1:52:38] thousands of times, thousands of cases.
[1:52:40] How could you, how could a drunkard a
[1:52:42] few weeks ago or a few months ago and a
[1:52:44] gentleman this afternoon, how could a
[1:52:45] street harlot a few weeks ago and a lady
[1:52:47] this afternoon by the transforming power
[1:52:50] of God being transmitted by the Holy
[1:52:52] Ghost into your heart changed your
[1:52:55] nature and changed your making, it made
[1:52:58] you another person. That's right. You
[1:53:00] might not have felt it. Hallelujah. I
[1:53:03] don't know. I don't know about that. I
[1:53:04] don't know. You might not have felt it,
[1:53:05] but it's here anyhow. Whether you feel
[1:53:07] it or whether you don't, let's give God
[1:53:09] thanks for it, for it's here anyhow,
[1:53:12] whether you feel it or whether you
[1:53:14] don't, I can prove to you right now
[1:53:16] there's radio coming uh in through here.
[1:53:18] You don't feel it, but you know it's
[1:53:20] there. There's television pictures
[1:53:22] coming right through here. There's
[1:53:23] probably messages you've got on your
[1:53:24] phone when we've been having this
[1:53:26] conversation tonight, but you didn't see
[1:53:27] them come in, right? They're in
[1:53:29] invisible something that's come in, but
[1:53:31] it's here, right? Yes. Going right
[1:53:33] through you. Somebody saying yes
[1:53:36] on the radio.
[1:53:38] Well, it comes right through you as it
[1:53:40] goes through them them powers,
[1:53:41] electronics and so forth as it goes
[1:53:43] through your body. Now when it hits
[1:53:45] against that crystal in the set or it
[1:53:47] just catches it like that and you hear
[1:53:49] yes. Now if God is up there by his
[1:53:51] stripes you were healed and the Holy
[1:53:52] Ghost entwines and brings that down by
[1:53:54] the power of God. Your heart is set on
[1:53:56] that and it says yes.
[1:54:00] &gt;&gt; You hear it? You hear the voice of yes.
[1:54:03] Whatsoever things you desire when you
[1:54:05] pray, believe you receive it. Lord, we
[1:54:07] prayed for a meeting. We've been fasting
[1:54:09] for a meeting. We've been crying for a
[1:54:11] meeting. Yes, Lord. I believe the
[1:54:13] meeting's on the road. Then stand there
[1:54:14] like that until power of God comes down
[1:54:16] and it hits and it says yes. And the
[1:54:19] next man says yes. And the next man says
[1:54:21] yes. And then you got double the power
[1:54:23] of yes. Yes. Triple the power of yes.
[1:54:26] Four times the power of yes. First thing
[1:54:28] you know, it becomes thousands of powers
[1:54:30] of yes. Then the Holy Spirit moves in
[1:54:33] and confirms the word of God with signs
[1:54:36] and wonders following. That's it. That's
[1:54:38] what we need. An expectation. Yes. Yes.
[1:54:42] Yes. If you could say it and then you
[1:54:44] could say it and you could say a
[1:54:46] thousand yeses
[1:54:48] &gt;&gt; to the promises of God and expectation
[1:54:51] that he can move in our midst tonight.
[1:54:53] You know that's what's the matter with
[1:54:54] the church today is they don't get in
[1:54:56] the spirit enough.
[1:54:58] &gt;&gt; We're too much in ourselves. Maya, if
[1:55:00] you'll just get out of yourself long
[1:55:01] enough. You say, "Well, you know, our
[1:55:03] church, we have a regular routine." Oh,
[1:55:05] who cares about your routine? I wish
[1:55:07] you'd get out of the routine long enough
[1:55:09] to get saved. Get saved. Get out of the
[1:55:12] routine. We don't care about the
[1:55:14] routine. Get in the spirit and then you
[1:55:17] can see things done. And until you get
[1:55:19] in the spirit of liberty, you'll always
[1:55:21] be in bondage.
[1:55:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:55:24] &gt;&gt; Don't ask advice from a prisoner about
[1:55:27] how to get free.
[1:55:30] Some of you are young and
[1:55:31] impressionable. Don't take financial
[1:55:33] advice from your broke uncle.
[1:55:36] &gt;&gt; Right? Why would you do that? Why would
[1:55:39] you take advice from somebody who's
[1:55:40] never
[1:55:42] All right?
[1:55:45] Why would you take advice from somebody
[1:55:46] who's never dwelt under the presence of
[1:55:48] that shakina glory and tell you that it
[1:55:51] doesn't exist or it's just fanaticism or
[1:55:53] it's just it's just a ridiculous idea. I
[1:55:55] don't take advice from somebody who's
[1:55:57] never been under that. That's why
[1:55:58] there's a commission in this end time
[1:56:00] that every ministry should have met him
[1:56:02] on the sacred sands face to face. Come
[1:56:04] under the washing of that shakina glory
[1:56:07] so that we can know what we're talking
[1:56:09] about. When I can tell you that when you
[1:56:11] get under this shakina washing, it'll
[1:56:13] clean you. It'll cleanse you. It'll
[1:56:15] loose you. It'll wash you from the cares
[1:56:18] of this age. It will make you a new
[1:56:20] creation in Christ. I know what I'm
[1:56:23] speaking of. Brother Matt's a testimony.
[1:56:26] We know what we're talking about because
[1:56:28] we were not in the pathway of God.
[1:56:32] &gt;&gt; But under that shikina presence, under
[1:56:34] that dispensation of his Holy Ghost
[1:56:36] outpouring,
[1:56:38] &gt;&gt; oh my, it never gets old. I don't
[1:56:40] believe there's an expiration on it.
[1:56:42] &gt;&gt; I believe you got to come the same way
[1:56:43] that Paul came.
[1:56:45] &gt;&gt; You got to come the same way that I
[1:56:46] came. You got to come the same way that
[1:56:48] Jason came. You got to come the same way
[1:56:50] that every surrendered heart has come.
[1:56:52] There is no silver spoon in the message
[1:56:54] of the hour that you are exempt from
[1:56:56] getting under the baptism of the Holy
[1:56:58] Ghost. This is a mandatory requirement
[1:57:01] in this age. And until we surrender our
[1:57:04] own idea and say, "Lord, do what you
[1:57:06] want with me. Wash me in your word. I
[1:57:08] don't like me. I want you."
[1:57:12] &gt;&gt; Your thoughts have never won you a
[1:57:14] battle. They have never made you
[1:57:16] succeed, but just one of his thoughts.
[1:57:19] Hallelujah. I know the thoughts that I
[1:57:21] think towards you. They are thoughts of
[1:57:23] good. They are thoughts of peace to give
[1:57:26] you an expected end of victory.
[1:57:30] &gt;&gt; He's not giving you expected end of
[1:57:31] defeat. Friend, you are victorious
[1:57:34] through Christ who strengthens you. You
[1:57:36] can do all things.
[1:57:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:57:40] &gt;&gt; But you have to come under the same
[1:57:43] the same blood that we've all had to
[1:57:44] come under. Well, I don't know what
[1:57:46] it'll make me do.
[1:57:49] Well, maybe it'll make you come and and
[1:57:50] and maybe it'll make you be a preacher
[1:57:52] one night at a Thursday night at a Bethl
[1:57:53] camp. You don't know what it'll make you
[1:57:56] do.
[1:57:58] But one thing it will do is it will free
[1:57:59] you from the oppressions of this age
[1:58:02] where the only place that you can tr you
[1:58:04] can find true freedom.
[1:58:07] Medications wear off.
[1:58:12] Some of you are here. You don't have
[1:58:13] your parents that you to cry on their
[1:58:14] shoulder. So, you need somebody that
[1:58:16] goes with you all the time. everywhere.
[1:58:20] What happens if I get into one of my
[1:58:21] anxiety fits at this camp? There's a God
[1:58:23] here who is more powerful than any
[1:58:26] Xanax. There's a God here who is more
[1:58:28] powerful than any medication of this
[1:58:30] age. He's a God who can fix you under
[1:58:33] his anointing and his presence. Now, I'm
[1:58:35] not preaching against medication. Take
[1:58:36] it if you have it. But there's a God who
[1:58:38] who can restore your body back to where
[1:58:41] it was when you didn't have that
[1:58:43] struggle, when you didn't have that
[1:58:44] thing. You know that God sees you the
[1:58:46] way that he made you in the back part of
[1:58:47] his mind before there ever was a trial.
[1:58:50] You are in God's mind. That means he's
[1:58:52] not looking at you through your sin or
[1:58:53] your fault. He's looking at you the way
[1:58:55] that he sees you in his mind. Before
[1:58:58] there ever was a trial, I just like to
[1:59:00] tell the devil this tonight. I'm older
[1:59:01] than you.
[1:59:06] &gt;&gt; Before Lucifer was, you were. And before
[1:59:09] Lucifer was, you were an overcomer. That
[1:59:11] means that whatever he can produce, it
[1:59:14] cannot take you out of your position
[1:59:15] because you came from before him. Before
[1:59:18] there ever was iniquity found, you are
[1:59:20] already in the mind of God. And who has
[1:59:22] more authority on earth? A son of God or
[1:59:26] an angel?
[1:59:27] &gt;&gt; A son of God. Which means on your worst
[1:59:30] day when you feel like the worst
[1:59:32] Christian in the building, even if
[1:59:34] iniquity had never been found in
[1:59:35] Lucifer, you are still over him. He is
[1:59:38] still under your feet. Your position is
[1:59:42] over the devil. Your position is to
[1:59:44] tread on serpents. Your position is to
[1:59:48] overcome in this age. Wow. Hallelujah.
[1:59:52] &gt;&gt; You've been given authority. And I'm
[1:59:54] looking at faces and voices that have
[1:59:56] more authority. Hallelujah.
[1:59:59] &gt;&gt; If one can chase a thousand.
[2:00:03] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. What's the potential in
[2:00:05] this room?
[2:00:08] We're not waiting for the attack to
[2:00:10] come. The attack's already on us,
[2:00:11] friends. There's already 200,000,000
[2:00:13] demons attacking you. They're already
[2:00:15] plaguing your mind. They already stopped
[2:00:16] you from coming here. Tried to stop you
[2:00:18] from coming here. But guess what? They
[2:00:20] didn't have enough
[2:00:22] cuz you came anyway. You overcame what
[2:00:25] was trying to say, "No, I can't go." Or,
[2:00:27] "No, I don't want to make it." You had
[2:00:28] something within you that was a greater
[2:00:30] driving force than 200,000,000 demons
[2:00:34] because Satan sent his best to this age.
[2:00:36] I really believe that we're not just
[2:00:38] fighting little spirits, conjur, these
[2:00:39] are the worst of the worst, right? You
[2:00:41] know, you you deal with them. These are
[2:00:43] the worst devils that there ever has
[2:00:44] been on the face of the earth.
[2:00:47] And the devil has sent his best to
[2:00:49] attack you.
[2:00:51] But God also sent his best.
[2:00:55] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah.
[2:00:56] &gt;&gt; I'm gonna say it again. God also sent
[2:00:58] his best. While the devil threw
[2:01:00] everything he could at you, God had
[2:01:02] already thought of you in his mind as an
[2:01:04] overcomer in this age. And he said,
[2:01:06] "I'll send them to that time when the
[2:01:08] greatest of enemies is plaguing minds
[2:01:10] and taking victories and ripping apart
[2:01:12] homes and ripping apart relationships
[2:01:14] with God. I'll send you and I'll send
[2:01:16] you and I'll send her and her and her
[2:01:18] because they will be overcomers
[2:01:21] under the greatest dispensation that
[2:01:23] we've ever known." This is your age,
[2:01:25] friend.
[2:01:27] This is not a Methodist age. This is not
[2:01:29] a Pentecostal age. This is a bride age.
[2:01:32] And I believe that the bride has been
[2:01:33] given authority to rule in this age.
[2:01:36] We're not going to control the politics
[2:01:38] of the world. We're moving in liberty
[2:01:40] with the word.
[2:01:42] You've been given full authority. You've
[2:01:45] been given the right to move into every
[2:01:48] promise that God has saved for this
[2:01:50] position in time. It's yours, friend.
[2:01:54] Well, we don't do it that way at our
[2:01:56] church. We don't do it that way in our
[2:01:57] but I'm going to just ask you. This is
[2:01:59] not your church.
[2:02:01] This is not my church. This is a message
[2:02:03] camp where we want the message to have
[2:02:06] liberty. We want the message to move
[2:02:08] upon the young people as the message has
[2:02:10] promised to do. And the message has
[2:02:12] brought liberty to the captive and said
[2:02:15] this day this scripture is fulfilled. If
[2:02:18] you finish the rest of that scripture,
[2:02:19] Jesus closes the book, right? And then
[2:02:21] we find it open again in Revelations.
[2:02:22] And what's the rest of that scripture?
[2:02:24] in the day of his vengeance.
[2:02:27] &gt;&gt; Take that word vengeance. It means
[2:02:28] vindicated. In the day of his
[2:02:30] vindication,
[2:02:32] &gt;&gt; you know what that word means? It means
[2:02:34] loosed.
[2:02:36] In the day of the loosing.
[2:02:39] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:02:40] Sorry, I don't want to go into the
[2:02:41] Greek, but there's a lot of powerful
[2:02:42] words in there. In the day of his
[2:02:44] loosing. Why would he call this the day
[2:02:47] of his loosing? You go to Revelations
[2:02:49] 15. Who hath washed us in his blood.
[2:02:51] Right? Brother Brandham tells us in the
[2:02:52] church age book that that word washed is
[2:02:54] loosed. So he has loosed us in this age.
[2:02:58] And why would he loose us in this age,
[2:03:00] but that we could have liberty under the
[2:03:02] word of God. There is no quote that I'm
[2:03:05] ashamed of. There is no section of the
[2:03:07] message that I will back up on. I
[2:03:09] believe this is the full word. I believe
[2:03:11] everything in it is for this age. I
[2:03:13] believe everything in it is for this
[2:03:15] time. I don't care if it was pre63 or
[2:03:18] post 63. I believe it was for a bride at
[2:03:21] the end time that we might gain access
[2:03:24] to the promises of God and we don't have
[2:03:26] to lay down in this Leo to seeing world
[2:03:28] that we're in. But we're rising up.
[2:03:32] You're rising up. Can you say yes to
[2:03:34] that tonight? Can you say yes and four
[2:03:37] yeses and five yeses?
[2:03:40] &gt;&gt; This is our age, our time. Friends, I
[2:03:43] don't believe I'm preaching to the
[2:03:44] church of tomorrow. I believe I'm
[2:03:46] preaching to the church of right now.
[2:03:48] You are today's church.
[2:03:51] &gt;&gt; I believe there's a powerhouse laying
[2:03:54] inside you that if you would allow the
[2:03:55] Lord to use it,
[2:03:59] &gt;&gt; every enemy, every enemy will fall short
[2:04:03] under that anointing.
[2:04:06] He's done it before and he's promised to
[2:04:08] do it again. Friend, he's just looking
[2:04:10] for you to put the yes in your mouth.
[2:04:14] Say yes. I believe that. Yes. This
[2:04:16] message is for me. Yes,
[2:04:19] intellectually
[2:04:20] it'll never work.
[2:04:24] But with a true experience,
[2:04:26] this word becomes yay and amen. Every
[2:04:29] promise of God, no matter what it looks
[2:04:31] like, no matter what you feel like, this
[2:04:33] word will produce what it said it will
[2:04:35] produce.
[2:04:38] &gt;&gt; In spite of my weaknesses, if it was on
[2:04:40] my strength, I would have given up a
[2:04:41] long time ago. But it's not on my
[2:04:43] strength. I said yes. And when I said
[2:04:46] yes almost 20 years ago now, that yes is
[2:04:49] still ringing in my life. That yes is
[2:04:51] still coming forth in my life. That yes
[2:04:53] is still yay and amen. Trials, yes.
[2:04:56] Fallen, yes. Mistakes, yes.
[2:05:00] But the commitment holds.
[2:05:02] &gt;&gt; The yes that I promised him holds. And
[2:05:05] whatever the devil could bring against
[2:05:07] me, it's not enough to stop what God has
[2:05:10] already planned.
[2:05:12] &gt;&gt; Who's greater? Come on, friends. Let's
[2:05:14] just take this simple. Who's more
[2:05:16] powerful? Well, God is. So, whose plan's
[2:05:20] going to win? Well, God's plan.
[2:05:23] Who's in God's plan? Yes.
[2:05:27] Who's an overcomer sent to this age?
[2:05:29] Yes.
[2:05:31] Who's going to defeat every enemy that
[2:05:33] they're facing in their life? Yes.
[2:05:36] &gt;&gt; He's given us everything that we have
[2:05:38] need of. He showed us that this word
[2:05:40] works. This message works, friends. This
[2:05:44] word will stand the test of time. Even
[2:05:46] when you don't see it or you don't feel
[2:05:47] like you may not understand it, he never
[2:05:49] asked you to understand it.
[2:05:52] &gt;&gt; Moses didn't even know how to read. But
[2:05:54] he didn't ask Moses to read. He asked
[2:05:56] Moses to have a faith that when he
[2:05:58] jumped there'd be a hole there when he
[2:05:59] got there. He didn't ask you to
[2:06:01] understand every quote and every every
[2:06:02] scripture and to tie together the seals
[2:06:04] and the trumpets and all these. He
[2:06:05] didn't ask that of you. He asked if you
[2:06:07] believe.
[2:07:05] Lord, I need help. I need I need some
[2:07:07] help. You told me that I could overcome
[2:07:09] every giant that I'm fighting. I need
[2:07:11] help. You know, it's okay sometimes,
[2:07:13] friends.
[2:07:16] I don't have this all together. I need
[2:07:18] help.
[2:07:20] I got to have help. I I I need I need I
[2:07:23] need the Lord to come in this situation.
[2:07:24] I got to have help. Any any man of
[2:07:27] wisdom will testify to you. They never
[2:07:29] did anything on their own. It took the
[2:07:31] help of God.
[2:07:34] And Joshua said, "Lord, I need help. You
[2:07:36] promised
[2:07:39] and stones of fire rain down from
[2:07:41] heaven." Think this is impossible.
[2:07:44] This is an impossible feat that
[2:07:46] hailstones from heaven would rain down
[2:07:49] from from heaven and they only hit the
[2:07:51] giants.
[2:07:54] Why? Because a man asked for help.
[2:07:57] &gt;&gt; And there they are in the midst of the
[2:07:58] battle and he's about to draw his sword
[2:07:59] and go after one and boom, there's a
[2:08:01] giant giant falls before him. Another
[2:08:04] hailstone. Boom. And another giant falls
[2:08:05] before him and another giant falls
[2:08:07] before him and another giant. Another
[2:08:09] giant. Before they know it, that entire
[2:08:10] valley was defeated. And all of the
[2:08:13] giants were underneath of those stones.
[2:08:15] Right now, we think of these stones as
[2:08:17] big, big, huge boulders, right? That
[2:08:18] rain from heaven. But God moves in small
[2:08:20] ways. God moves in what we would we
[2:08:22] would maybe overlook, but he's moving.
[2:08:27] &gt;&gt; It might just be a little yes from you
[2:08:29] tonight, but he's moving.
[2:08:33] If I could just get a whisper of a yes.
[2:08:35] Yes.
[2:08:37] Yes, Lord.
[2:08:39] Yes, Lord.
[2:08:41] And these these these stones were
[2:08:43] created for the purpose of killing
[2:08:45] giants. That was what God designed them
[2:08:48] for. You know, there's things in our in
[2:08:50] our potential, in our hand, that have
[2:08:52] been designed to destroy giants in this
[2:08:54] age.
[2:08:59] Remember, it was David, the same David
[2:09:01] that nobody bet on was there in the
[2:09:03] valley against Goliath.
[2:09:06] And that giant had stopped the move of
[2:09:08] God. Everybody was so afraid to move.
[2:09:11] But there was a David amongst them.
[2:09:16] David just had a little visit with the
[2:09:18] Lord down by the stream. We stopped on
[2:09:20] the road here. I was down by the little
[2:09:22] stream. Beautiful area down there. I
[2:09:23] just began to look at the little little
[2:09:24] stones. The Lord refreshed this thought
[2:09:26] to me.
[2:09:28] Nobody saw potential in those little
[2:09:29] stones.
[2:09:31] Nobody saw the potential that those
[2:09:33] stones would carry in them.
[2:09:36] Maybe nobody sees the potential in you.
[2:09:39] Maybe you're just thinking you're an
[2:09:41] insignificant youth here. Just
[2:09:44] maybe nobody's really recognized the
[2:09:46] potential in you.
[2:09:49] There's a God who designed you.
[2:09:52] Who knows right where you're at, who has
[2:09:53] polished you for such a time as this.
[2:09:58] David just bends down and picks up.
[2:09:59] Well, here's a peculiar looking stone.
[2:10:02] All sudden, David begins to recall,
[2:10:04] "These stones have killed giants before.
[2:10:09] I'm in the same valley where Joshua
[2:10:11] fought those giants. This is a peculiar
[2:10:13] looking stone. I'm going to pick this
[2:10:15] up." Works is faith expressed. That's a
[2:10:18] peculiar looking stone. But this has
[2:10:20] killed giants before. I'm going to put
[2:10:22] this in my satchel and I'm going to go
[2:10:24] I'm going to go to the war. Oh, here's
[2:10:25] another peculiar looking stone. The
[2:10:27] mighty conqueror. That's a peculiar
[2:10:29] looking one. But this has killed giants
[2:10:30] before. I'm going to put it in my
[2:10:32] stature. You see, friends, we didn't get
[2:10:33] sent here without ammunition, but we
[2:10:35] have everything that we have need of to
[2:10:38] overcome in this age. And it may seem
[2:10:40] peculiar to you, but if you pick it up
[2:10:43] and you put it in the sling of your
[2:10:44] mouth and you say yes to the promise of
[2:10:47] God, you say yes, yes, yes, yes, then
[2:10:51] that promise will come to pass in your
[2:10:53] life. These stones have killed giants
[2:10:55] before. Hallelujah. I was right here on
[2:10:58] this stage last year. And giants were
[2:11:00] killed here before. And you know what,
[2:11:02] brother Matt? It's going to be the same
[2:11:03] thing this year. There's going to be
[2:11:05] giants slain all over this building
[2:11:08] because somebody will rise up and they
[2:11:10] will say, "I am I am I am I am a David.
[2:11:15] I am a I am a Paul. I am an Isaiah. I am
[2:11:20] an Esther. I am a Ruth. I say yes to the
[2:11:23] promises of God."
[2:11:26] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[2:11:28] &gt;&gt; There's no power that can hold back when
[2:11:30] you recognize
[2:11:32] if you say to this mountain.
[2:11:36] Yes.
[2:11:38] Yes. The music players will come. Yes.
[2:11:42] Yes.
[2:11:45] Once more, Lord. Yes. Do it in me. Yes.
[2:11:49] Now friend, I don't know what your
[2:11:50] expectation is, but if you had an
[2:11:53] expectation to come to these services
[2:11:56] and receive an outpouring of the Holy
[2:11:58] Ghost, then it's yours if you just say
[2:12:01] yes. If you came to these services and
[2:12:03] you have an expectation of being healed,
[2:12:05] it's yours if you could say yes.
[2:12:09] You're coming to this camp, Lord, I just
[2:12:11] want to have I want to be clear of all
[2:12:13] the confusion. You know that in just one
[2:12:15] word, he can clear away the confusion of
[2:12:17] a lifetime.
[2:12:20] Alls it takes is a yes from you.
[2:12:24] But friends, you got you got people here
[2:12:26] to fight for you.
[2:12:29] Brother Matt's here. Brother Matt's
[2:12:30] here. Brother Codra's here. We're here
[2:12:32] to fight for you. Brother Paul's here.
[2:12:35] Brother Brad's here. We're here to fight
[2:12:36] for you. How many elders will fight for
[2:12:38] the young people? These counselors
[2:12:40] didn't come here. These people workers
[2:12:42] didn't come here just because they have
[2:12:42] nothing else to do. They're here for
[2:12:44] you.
[2:12:45] They thought so much of you that they
[2:12:46] would come and sacrifice their time and
[2:12:48] they would they would come down to this
[2:12:50] camp so that they could create an
[2:12:51] atmosphere where you
[2:12:55] could enter into the promises of God.
[2:12:57] Friends, don't go home when you got
[2:13:00] nobody to fight with you. Take the
[2:13:02] battle now. Take the battle now while
[2:13:04] there's swords drawn in your favor that
[2:13:07] are driving back the spirits. You've
[2:13:09] been given a bucket in this age and I
[2:13:10] say you fill it up while you're here.
[2:13:12] Lord, fill my bucket. fill my cup, fill
[2:13:14] all that I am. I don't want this to
[2:13:16] exhaust when I get home, but I want to
[2:13:18] be refreshed, renewed, under under a new
[2:13:21] anointing, a new authority in my life. I
[2:13:23] I say what the devil says is a lie, and
[2:13:26] I say yes to the promises of God. Yes
[2:13:28] and amen to everything that God has
[2:13:31] delivered to his church in this age.
[2:13:34] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:13:35] &gt;&gt; Is that simple enough for us tonight?
[2:13:38] Can you just say yes this weekend?
[2:13:42] just a yes
[2:13:45] when the inspiration of the Lord comes
[2:13:46] by. Maybe it'll be in a morning
[2:13:48] devotion. Maybe it'll be in a
[2:13:50] conversation with somebody this weekend.
[2:13:51] Maybe it'll be while the man of God is
[2:13:53] preaching the message across this
[2:13:54] pulpit.
[2:13:57] Could you just say yes?
[2:14:01] Yes, Lord.
[2:14:04] Maybe you don't feel victorious tonight,
[2:14:06] but can you see it?
[2:14:11] Can you see a victorious you
[2:14:14] that's not under the under the dominion
[2:14:16] of the attacks of the enemy in this age?
[2:14:21] How about it? How about it in this
[2:14:22] section?
[2:14:24] Can you see yourself
[2:14:26] unanxious,
[2:14:30] delivered from every fear and every
[2:14:32] worry? Can you see yourself liberated?
[2:14:35] Can you see you see somebody else
[2:14:37] rejoicing in the in the spirit of God?
[2:14:39] You say, "I want that to be me." Can you
[2:14:40] see yourself in that position? Can you
[2:14:43] see yourself in the position of liberty
[2:14:44] where you don't care who's around? You
[2:14:46] don't care what's going on around you.
[2:14:48] It's you and the Lord and nobody else.
[2:14:49] Can Can you see yourself there? You
[2:14:52] might not feel it right now. I'm not
[2:14:53] asking you if you feel it, but can you
[2:14:55] see it?
[2:15:01] Can you see yourself with a real smile
[2:15:03] on before that old demon of depression
[2:15:06] creeped in your life? Tried to take away
[2:15:08] every victory that you had. Remember
[2:15:10] what it looked like when you used to
[2:15:11] look in the mirror and smile?
[2:15:14] You may not feel that way, but can you
[2:15:16] see it?
[2:15:18] Can you say, "Yes, that's that's who I
[2:15:21] am.
[2:15:25] Yes, I I I'm I'm a true son of God.
[2:15:28] Yeah, that's who I am.
[2:15:32] &gt;&gt; Yeah, the devil's had his way with me
[2:15:34] and had me torn apart this way and this
[2:15:35] way, but I'm a true son of God. That's
[2:15:39] who I am. Can you see that tonight?
[2:15:42] &gt;&gt; Can you see yourself walking in the
[2:15:44] victory,
[2:15:49] &gt;&gt; friend? the potential
[2:15:52] that's been released in this age, in
[2:15:54] this meeting.
[2:15:58] You might wonder how you ended up here,
[2:16:00] but God set you up.
[2:16:05] He's not going to leave one.
[2:16:08] He's not going to forget one,
[2:16:11] but he knows you. He built you.
[2:16:14] What if we could just sing that song?
[2:16:21] Yes. Yes. Lord your eyes
[2:16:26] upon
[2:16:28] Jesus.

[2:16:39] face.
[2:16:44] And the things
[2:16:48] of earth
[2:16:50] will grow strange
[2:16:56] in the light
[2:16:59] of his glory

[2:17:50] and
[2:17:52] we can sing that song. I give myself
[2:17:54] away. I give myself away.

[2:24:03] When nobody else
[2:24:08] nobody else thought I would be a winner.
[2:24:10] He chose me. He placed me. He anointed
[2:24:13] me. And he didn't anoint me sparingly.
[2:24:16] But in this age, he poured out the
[2:24:17] bottle of anointing oil upon his church.
[2:24:20] And he said, "You will be an overcomer.
[2:24:22] You will be victorious."
[2:24:25] I choose that me. It's a reality,
[2:24:28] friends. It's a reality.
[2:24:31] It's a yes.
[2:24:53] That's not a hard word. Just say yes.

[2:26:54] evening.
[2:26:56] My goodness.
[2:27:03] [Applause]
[2:27:06] You know I was reminded of brother
[2:27:08] Brandamman conferences 63. He said,
[2:27:12] referring to the scripture, he's the
[2:27:15] high priest of your confession.
[2:27:18] Brother Brandham would take a number of
[2:27:20] sermons and go into detail and and just
[2:27:25] nail it down that if you're afraid to
[2:27:28] confess,
[2:27:30] even Jesus can't help you because he's
[2:27:33] the high priest of your confession.
[2:27:37] He says he can only here's one of the
[2:27:39] places he can only only help you as you
[2:27:45] believe it.
[2:27:48] &gt;&gt; You know, I remember five, six years ago
[2:27:50] now,
[2:27:52] brother Matthew had a tremendous vision
[2:27:56] for this camp and but it seemed almost
[2:27:59] impossible. It seemed like there were so
[2:28:01] many things that said, "No, there's no
[2:28:03] way a camp of this scale, we can have
[2:28:05] youth weekends, but to have a camp like
[2:28:08] this, but this was brother Matt's
[2:28:10] vision. I had had that vision years ago
[2:28:12] and thought, I'll never be able to pull
[2:28:13] it off." And I I I'm grateful to the
[2:28:16] Lord that we began to coales teams and
[2:28:19] and began to take a hold of that vision.
[2:28:23] And people just started saying, "Yes, we
[2:28:25] can do this." And the enemy kept saying,
[2:28:28] "No, you can't." And we kept saying,
[2:28:30] "Yes, we can." And the enemy just said,
[2:28:32] "No, there's this problem. There's that
[2:28:34] problem." But somehow the Holy Spirit
[2:28:36] just kept saying, "Yes. Yes." I'm here
[2:28:39] to tell you something, friends. You
[2:28:40] might have had every kind of problem in
[2:28:41] the world getting here. Might have been
[2:28:43] impossible. But I think the Holy Spirit
[2:28:45] was saying, "Yes, you can get here. And
[2:28:48] yes, you're going to be given an
[2:28:49] opportunity. You are here tonight to
[2:28:53] you. You've come here this weekend to
[2:28:55] receive your opportunity to hear the
[2:28:59] word and say yes. Hallelujah.
[2:29:03] Are you willing to say yes to the word?
[2:29:06] Listen friends, that's how the Holy
[2:29:07] Ghost comes. The the the Holy Ghost, the
[2:29:10] baptism of the Holy Ghost is a
[2:29:12] revelation personally of Christ to you.
[2:29:15] That's the new birth. That's what the
[2:29:18] Holy Ghost seals in you is a perfect
[2:29:21] faith in the revealed word of this hour.
[2:29:24] That is that is what the Holy Ghost
[2:29:26] seals inside you. And I promise you when
[2:29:29] that happens, you'll never say no to it
[2:29:31] again. Everything, every word, every
[2:29:35] line, you'll say yes Lord. Yes, Lord.
[2:29:38] How many have had had that experience? I
[2:29:40] say yes to every word.
[2:29:44] &gt;&gt; I want to tell you something, friends.
[2:29:45] When brother Ronnie said, "When you know
[2:29:48] when when you when you say yes, you're
[2:29:51] saying no to the world." And I thought
[2:29:54] to myself, you know, when when I say yes
[2:29:57] to the word, that's all God hears. God
[2:30:01] God hears me say yes and then God hears
[2:30:04] me say no to the world. That's what God
[2:30:07] is hearing. The devil will never hear
[2:30:10] you say no to him. You might not even
[2:30:12] think you say no to the world
[2:30:14] sufficiently. We've all been there.
[2:30:16] Amen.
[2:30:17] &gt;&gt; But I'm here to tell you something. When
[2:30:19] I said yes to the word, the Holy Spirit
[2:30:22] from that moment has never heard me say
[2:30:25] no again to the word of God. It's yes to
[2:30:28] the word, no to the world. And I don't
[2:30:32] care what the devil I'm here to tell
[2:30:34] you, he can he can jump up and down. He
[2:30:37] can complain. But, you know, I found out
[2:30:40] that I'm older than him.
[2:30:43] And and I found out I started before
[2:30:45] him. And I found out I'll still be alive
[2:30:49] when he's a spoonful of ashes at the
[2:30:52] bottom of the lake of fire. I'll still
[2:30:56] be saying yes to every word of God.
[2:31:02] [Music]
[2:31:04] I want to say yes, Lord, to every word.
[2:31:10] That's the opportunity you have here
[2:31:12] tonight. You've heard the word. Say yes
[2:31:14] to it. Jesus can't help you if you're
[2:31:17] afraid to confess it. Quit believing the
[2:31:19] devil. And for sure, quit believing you.
[2:31:22] Start believing him.
[2:31:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. I said I said a long time ago when
[2:31:28] I when I met him, brother Ronnie, when I
[2:31:31] met Jesus,
[2:31:33] I didn't want to be me anymore.
[2:31:36] I was so done with me. I want to tell
[2:31:39] you something, friends. When Jacob
[2:31:40] finally got a hold, when Jacob wrestled
[2:31:42] with that angel, Jacob was so done with
[2:31:46] being Jacob. Oh, I met Jesus. I was so
[2:31:49] done with being me. I wanted to be him.
[2:31:52] I've wanted to be him ever since that
[2:31:55] hour, every day of my life. Sometimes I
[2:31:58] feel like, oh my goodness, I'm so far
[2:32:00] behind. But all I know is is he keeps
[2:32:02] hearing me say yes. Yes. Yes. To the
[2:32:06] word of God. Amen. Brother Wes, you're
[2:32:08] going to sing a song, I think, for us.
[2:32:10] Amen.
[2:32:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:32:12] &gt;&gt; In the name of Jesus.
[2:32:13] &gt;&gt; Let's sing along with our brother in
[2:32:14] worship. This is the beautiful time when
[2:32:17] the Holy Spirit can come and water the
[2:32:20] seed of the gospel. You know, Jesus
[2:32:22] called it that. Jesus called the gospel
[2:32:24] a seed. And I'm going to tell you
[2:32:25] something, friends. It's good seed. You
[2:32:28] let it get planted in your heart and let
[2:32:29] the Holy Spirit water it. You won't have
[2:32:31] to worry about it growing. It'll grow a
[2:32:33] life of the It'll grow you into a garden
[2:32:36] of God's life and you won't even all
[2:32:38] there's not enough devils in hell to
[2:32:40] stop it. Amen. Praise the Lord. Amen.
[2:32:42] Let's sing. Let's sing with Brother
[2:32:44] Wesley tonight. Break every stronghold.

[2:40:34] what a powerful name. What a powerful
[2:40:37] name it is. Oh, what a powerful name it
[2:40:42] is. Powerful name of Jesus
[2:40:47] Christ my king.

[2:41:05] the powerful, what a powerful name it

[2:41:54] What a wonderful name it is
[2:41:58] and nothing can stand against.
[2:42:01] Oh what a wonderful name it is the name
[2:42:07] of
[2:42:07] &gt;&gt; I wonder without the music. What a
[2:42:09] wonderful name.
[2:42:10] &gt;&gt; What a wonderful name it is. Let me hear
[2:42:14] those voices.
[2:42:15] [Music]
[2:42:18] &gt;&gt; Lift it up now.
[2:42:22] &gt;&gt; Oh, let him hear you.
[2:42:25] &gt;&gt; He's listening.
[2:42:28] &gt;&gt; Can you hear that, Lord? That's young
[2:42:31] men and young women that love you, Lord.
[2:42:39] &gt;&gt; The name of Jesus.
[2:42:44] Hallelujah.
[2:42:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:42:58] &gt;&gt; Worthy of God.
[2:43:07] Worthy is the lamb of God. My goodness,
[2:43:11] friends. Wonderful to have been in the
[2:43:13] house of God tonight. Have you enjoyed
[2:43:15] the word?
[2:43:17] &gt;&gt; I'm going to tell you something,
[2:43:18] friends. I believe that God has great
[2:43:21] things in store. You don't have to wait
[2:43:23] for another service. You can have
[2:43:25] everything met in tonight, right now.
[2:43:29] You don't have to leave here at all. I'm
[2:43:31] going to pray a prayer before we close.
[2:43:33] I'm going to pray a closing prayer. I
[2:43:35] suppose I don't think there's any other
[2:43:37] announcements to make. Just breakfast in
[2:43:39] the morning and u concessions are open
[2:43:43] tonight and then breakfast in the
[2:43:45] morning. Amen.
[2:43:48] You know, I I thought about
[2:43:52] brother Ronnie making that statement and
[2:43:54] I never thought about that before. You
[2:43:57] know, there was nothing special about
[2:43:59] those smooth stones that David picked
[2:44:02] up. There was no potential in those. I
[2:44:05] mean, think about when God, Brother Bram
[2:44:08] talks about like that that clinker that
[2:44:10] flew off of the sun and it flew so far
[2:44:12] and God said, "Stop right there." And he
[2:44:14] just started forming it and working on
[2:44:17] it over however many eons. And brother
[2:44:19] Ram said it doesn't say how long. Just
[2:44:21] in the beginning, God created the
[2:44:22] heavens and the earth. And you know,
[2:44:25] I've often thought about what was going
[2:44:27] through his mind when he made that small
[2:44:29] lonely hill that would be known as
[2:44:31] Goltha.
[2:44:33] And you know, I think it was perfectly
[2:44:36] in the mind of God when he laid smooth
[2:44:39] stones right there in a brook that
[2:44:41] thousands of years later, a young
[2:44:43] shepherd boy would hear a giant making
[2:44:47] claims that he couldn't back up and and
[2:44:50] cursing the God of Israel. And he picks
[2:44:53] up stones that had no chance of
[2:44:56] themselves to slay a giant. But once
[2:44:59] they were put in the hand and the sling
[2:45:01] of a man of faith, they became giant
[2:45:03] killers. I want to tell you something,
[2:45:05] friends. Don't let the devil cause you
[2:45:08] to devalue the value God sees in you and
[2:45:13] has chosen you and saw you and elected
[2:45:15] you to be here tonight to say yes to the
[2:45:18] word of God. That single that that's
[2:45:21] that's all that they did. Israel waited
[2:45:25] for for 1600 years of law. They waited
[2:45:29] for a day of jubilee.
[2:45:31] That long awaited Jubilee finally came
[2:45:34] on the day of Pentecost. And you know
[2:45:36] what? When they came that room and those
[2:45:40] devout Jews from all points around come
[2:45:43] there for the for the feast and all they
[2:45:45] heard was a word of God that pricricked
[2:45:47] their hearts and they just said, "Yes,
[2:45:51] what must we do?" Peter said, "You must
[2:45:53] do this." They said, "Yes." Amen. That's
[2:45:55] all it takes, friends, is a faith, an un
[2:46:00] an unyielding faith and a complete heart
[2:46:03] surrender to the word of God. The Holy
[2:46:06] Ghost is not a hard thing to get. All he
[2:46:08] needs is a complete vessel that says yes
[2:46:11] to every word and surrenders everything
[2:46:15] that you've ever been. And make that
[2:46:17] repentance full and unequivocal. and the
[2:46:21] promises unto you and to your children
[2:46:24] and as many as are are far off as many
[2:46:27] as the ever tonight. Did you hear his
[2:46:30] call to you tonight? Amen. Don't let the
[2:46:32] devil tell you it's somewhere way off.
[2:46:34] It's hard to get. It's not. The Lord,
[2:46:36] Brother Brandham said, the Lord wants to
[2:46:38] seal you into the Holy Ghost more than
[2:46:40] you even want to receive it yourself.
[2:46:42] I'm here. That's why we're here,
[2:46:43] friends. That's why we're preaching.
[2:46:45] That's why we're singing. That's why
[2:46:46] we're gathering. Is is not we can't give
[2:46:49] you the Holy Ghost. What we can do is
[2:46:51] give you the word. He sent his word and
[2:46:53] healed the people. Amen. You're washed
[2:46:56] clean by the washing of the water of the
[2:46:59] word. The Bible says the word of God is
[2:47:01] health to all your flesh, mind, body,
[2:47:03] and soul. You believe that?
[2:47:06] &gt;&gt; I want to tell you something, friends.
[2:47:08] You just make up your mind that I am
[2:47:12] to every word that proceedth from the
[2:47:16] mouth of God. And that's what you're
[2:47:17] going to hear. That's what you heard
[2:47:19] tonight. You didn't hear a man's
[2:47:20] opinion. You heard the word of God.
[2:47:23] Amen. Amen. I want to pray for you
[2:47:26] before we go. And we're going to let you
[2:47:28] go out and uh and have some fellowship
[2:47:31] and concessions are open. We'll see you
[2:47:33] tomorrow morning. We're going to have
[2:47:34] breakfast and a and uh and and ministry
[2:47:37] of the word tomorrow morning. So, we're
[2:47:39] looking forward to that. I want you to
[2:47:41] be praying for brother Paula Fontaine.
[2:47:43] Amen. Brother Paul, are you here? Wave
[2:47:44] at me. Is he in the building? Amen. I'm
[2:47:47] not sure. Brother Paul was really under
[2:47:48] the weather. Okay. Very good. Very good.
[2:47:51] And uh the enemy fought him some days
[2:47:54] before coming here and uh he by faith he
[2:47:57] got on the plane and made it here today.
[2:47:59] So you will you be holding up our
[2:48:01] brother in prayer. Amen. We don't want
[2:48:03] to uh we want to see the Lord have him
[2:48:05] at 100%. I just want to see the devil
[2:48:08] completely defeated. Amen. Amen. Let's
[2:48:11] bow our heads. Master,
[2:48:14] as we come to the end of this first
[2:48:15] night, Lord, it won't even it'll hardly
[2:48:18] it it'll be hard to believe how fast
[2:48:20] these services will go by. These days
[2:48:23] will just fly by, Lord. And we want to
[2:48:26] be able to maximize every waking hour,
[2:48:29] every moment, Father, that we can get
[2:48:32] more of you, Master. I pray that you
[2:48:34] will inspire these young men and young
[2:48:36] women to go from here tonight. And
[2:48:39] father, no matter what the challenge
[2:48:41] that is in their life, all you need them
[2:48:44] to do is say yes. Say amen to every word
[2:48:47] of God. Lord, you'll grant you you've
[2:48:51] sent us the perfect word and you sent us
[2:48:54] the faith to believe that word. All we
[2:48:57] have to do is accept it and receive it.
[2:48:59] You can't help us if we won't confess
[2:49:00] it. I'm not going to confess what the
[2:49:02] devil says anymore about me. I'm not
[2:49:04] going to confess what I think about me.
[2:49:06] I'm going to confess what he has said
[2:49:08] about me. I'm a believer in his word.
[2:49:12] There's something Lord from the depths
[2:49:14] of my soul that although many times I
[2:49:17] fail you, but I I have a perfect faith.
[2:49:20] Perfect faith resides in my innermost
[2:49:24] being. I say amen to every word of God.
[2:49:28] Lord, may you give these young men and
[2:49:30] young women who have come here who maybe
[2:49:31] don't know you and the power of your
[2:49:34] resurrection. Lord, I pray that you will
[2:49:36] give them a courage to go from here
[2:49:39] tonight that that that no matter what
[2:49:41] the circumstance is, no matter what of a
[2:49:44] failure they might feel, no matter what
[2:49:46] the enemy has lied to them, that they
[2:49:48] will go away from here with courage to
[2:49:50] say, "I believe what I heard tonight. I
[2:49:55] accept it. I believe it. I confess it. I
[2:49:59] put it on my lips and I speak it." Lord,
[2:50:02] may when they go to sleep tonight, the
[2:50:04] last thing they'll remember saying is,
[2:50:07] "Yes, Lord. I believe your word." When
[2:50:10] they wake up tomorrow morning, may they
[2:50:12] say, "Yeah, Lord. Yes, I'm continuing to
[2:50:16] believe your word. I say yes." May you
[2:50:20] grant it, Lord. We commit them into your
[2:50:22] hands tonight as we conclude this first
[2:50:25] night's service. Lord, may you bless us
[2:50:27] through the night. Keep us safe, Father.
[2:50:30] May give us the good night's rest. We'll
[2:50:32] rise tomorrow morning ready to receive
[2:50:34] more of you, Lord God. I pray you'll
[2:50:36] grant it. We believe you will grant it,
[2:50:39] Lord. And we accept it in the mighty
[2:50:41] name of Jesus Christ. Amen. God bless
[2:50:45] you. Shake hands with somebody near you.
[2:50:47] God bless you. You can be dismissed at
[2:50:49] your leisure. These musicians will play
[2:50:51] and we'll sing. If you want to stay in
[2:50:54] worship, you're more than welcome. God
[2:50:55] bless you.
[2:51:01] And I know
[2:51:04] that there are angels
[2:51:09] all around.
[2:51:16] Let us praise
[2:51:22] oh
[2:51:24] Jesus
[2:51:26] now
[2:51:27] [Music]
[2:51:31] for we are standing
[2:51:35] in
[2:51:37] his presence
[2:51:39] on holy
[2:51:42] around.
[2:51:45] Oh, when we are standing
[2:51:50] [Applause]
[2:51:54] on holy
[2:51:56] ground.
[2:51:59] [Music]
[2:52:00] Oh,
[2:52:02] and I know that there
[2:52:08] are angels
[2:52:11] all around.

[2:52:26] Jesus
[2:52:27] now.
[2:52:33] For we are standing
[2:52:37] in
[2:52:39] his presence
[2:52:41] on holy
[2:52:44] ground.
[2:52:47] [Music]
[2:52:48] Oh, let us praise
[2:52:54] [Music]
[2:52:57] Jesus
[2:52:58] now.
[2:53:01] [Music]
[2:53:03] Oh, we
[2:53:06] are standing
[2:53:08] in
[2:53:10] his presence
[2:53:12] on holy
[2:53:14] ground.
[2:53:15] [Music]
[2:53:20] I'm coming back to the heart of worship.
[2:53:27] And it's all about you.
[2:53:31] It's all about you, Jesus.
[2:53:36] Sorry, Lord, for the things I've made.
[2:53:42] But it's all about you.
[2:53:46] It's all about you, Jesus.
[2:53:51] I'm coming back to the heart of worship.
[2:53:57] And it's all about you.
[2:54:01] Oh, it's all about you, Jesus.
[2:54:06] I'm sorry, Lord, for the things I've
[2:54:11] made it. And it's all about you.
[2:54:16] Oh, it's all about you. Oh, I'm coming
[2:54:20] back. I'm coming back to the heart of
[2:54:26] worship.
[2:54:28] And it's all about you.
[2:54:31] Oh, it's all about you, Jesus.
[2:54:36] I'm sorry, Lord, for the thing I made.
[2:54:43] And it's all about you.
[2:54:47] It's all about you, Jesus.
[2:54:53] When the music fades
[2:54:57] and all is stripped away
[2:55:00] and I simply come
[2:55:05] [Music]
[2:55:08] longing just to bring
[2:55:12] something that's worth
[2:55:16] that will bless your heart.
[2:55:19] [Music]
[2:55:21] Wo I bring you more than a song
[2:55:27] for a song in itself
[2:55:30] if not what you have required.
[2:55:38] &gt;&gt; You search much deeper than this
[2:55:42] &gt;&gt; and the way things appear. You're
[2:55:46] looking into my heart.
[2:55:51] Oh, I'm coming back. I'm coming back to
[2:55:55] the heart of worship.
[2:56:00] And it's all about you.
[2:56:04] It's all about you, Jesus.
[2:56:08] I'm sorry, Lord, for the things I made.
[2:56:15] When it's all about you.
[2:56:18] Oh, it's all about you, Jesus.
[2:56:24] King of endless worth.
[2:56:28] Oh, no one could express
[2:56:32] how much you deserve.
[2:56:38] Oh,
[2:56:40] though I'm weak and poor,
[2:56:44] all I have is yours.
[2:56:48] every single breath.
[2:56:54] Oh, I'll give you more than a song.
[2:56:59] For a song in itself is not what you
[2:57:04] have required.
[2:57:08] Oh,
[2:57:10] you search much deeper within.
[2:57:14] [Music]
