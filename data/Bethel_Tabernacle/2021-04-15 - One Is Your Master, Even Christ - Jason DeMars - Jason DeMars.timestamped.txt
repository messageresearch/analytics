[24:22] how you've given us your spirit to lead
[24:23] us lord
[24:26] you you're the master
[24:29] you're our leader
[24:33] we want to follow you lord
[24:37] we ask that your spirit would just
[24:40] continue to
[24:41] be in control of the service but i would
[24:44] just step out of the way and let you
[24:46] move and work in my heart and in every
[24:49] heart here
[24:50] and every heart listening lord we want
[24:54] you to come
[24:55] and do what only you can do to touch us
[24:58] father
[25:00] we ask these things in jesus name amen
[25:05] while we're standing let's just turn to
[25:08] luke
[25:10] 14 27. i'm entitling this
[25:13] one as your master even christ
[25:18] so luke 14 27
[25:21] it's important for all of us not to get
[25:24] caught up in the normal
[25:26] routines of life and stop listening to
[25:29] that still small voice speaking to our
[25:31] hearts
[25:33] not just to be living in the natural
[25:35] realm and doing the normal
[25:38] things of every day of course we have to
[25:40] do that
[25:41] but there has to be something in our
[25:42] hearts that transcends that
[25:45] not just on sunday and wednesday but
[25:47] every single day every single moment
[25:51] and i believe we all i know myself we
[25:54] all need
[25:54] times to rededicate our hearts
[25:57] and minds to that simple truth
[26:01] that we are all to be led as individuals
[26:04] by christ there are some things like
[26:07] this that are so
[26:08] critical and key to the christian faith
[26:11] that
[26:12] without them you literally have nothing
[26:15] else and this is one of those things
[26:18] it's not a group walk it's not a church
[26:20] walk it's not a walk with your pastor
[26:22] it's a walk with you and christ alone
[26:26] there's only two people allowed in it
[26:29] only two people and whosoever does not
[26:33] bear his cross and come after me
[26:37] cannot be my disciple may the lord add
[26:39] the blessing to the reading of his word
[26:41] can be seated
[26:47] i just want to remind us all it's how
[26:49] important our personal relationship
[26:52] personal experience and individual walk
[26:55] with god is
[26:56] again it's not about a church it's not
[26:58] about a group it's not about a
[27:00] favorite minister or a group of
[27:04] ministers
[27:05] that we all think are associated
[27:07] together that we're following and take
[27:09] comfort
[27:10] that we're following it's about your
[27:13] heart
[27:14] and christ we gather as a troop
[27:18] as a church as a group made up of
[27:21] individuals
[27:22] who must be individually led by the
[27:24] spirit of god
[27:26] so that when we come together each part
[27:28] of the body
[27:29] functions properly
[27:32] each individual member of we are a part
[27:35] of a body
[27:36] we're a part of a group but it's a
[27:38] mystical body
[27:41] it transcends this these walls
[27:45] the structure that we have as with a
[27:48] pastor and
[27:49] and trustees and deacons it transcends
[27:52] all of that
[27:53] and it goes to each one of you as an
[27:56] individual
[27:57] if each one of you is an individual is
[27:59] not led by the spirit
[28:03] your and your your part of your if a
[28:05] part of your body is not connected to
[28:06] the head
[28:07] what is it its paralysis takes place
[28:11] so if you are not individually led by
[28:15] the spirit of god
[28:17] it's causing paralysis in the body
[28:22] for a body to function properly
[28:25] every individual has to be connected
[28:29] to the head personally by revelation
[28:34] through the baptism of the holy ghost
[28:36] matthew 23 verse 2
[28:39] saying the scribes and pharisees sit in
[28:42] moses
[28:43] seat
[28:47] all therefore whatsoever they bid you
[28:50] observe that observe and do
[28:53] but do ye not after their works for they
[28:55] say and do not amen
[28:59] for they bind heavy burdens and grievous
[29:01] to be born and lay them on men's
[29:03] shoulders but they themselves will not
[29:05] move them with one of their fingers
[29:08] but all their works they do for to be
[29:10] seen of men now i
[29:12] i'm not up here to point fingers at who
[29:14] these pharisees
[29:15] are what i'm here to do is look at a
[29:18] motive of the heart
[29:20] but all their works they do why to be
[29:23] seen
[29:24] by those around them
[29:27] that's scary in other words they're in a
[29:30] group
[29:30] they're a part of a group and what they
[29:33] do they want
[29:34] to be seen by other people
[29:38] as what fitting into what that group
[29:40] does
[29:43] that's their mo that's the motive that
[29:45] they have of their heart they make broad
[29:48] their phylacteries they all they all do
[29:51] they're all making them broad and
[29:53] they're even in a competition to make
[29:55] make them broader and enlarge the
[29:57] borders of their
[29:58] garments and love the uppermost
[30:02] rooms at feast in other words and the
[30:03] chiefs in the synagogues
[30:05] they want to be honored they're looking
[30:08] to be honored they're looking to be
[30:10] served
[30:11] by other people
[30:14] and we're seven in gatherings in the
[30:17] markets
[30:18] and to be called of men rabbi rabbi
[30:23] but be not called rabbi
[30:26] for one is your master even christ
[30:30] and all ye are brethren
[30:34] we're all equal that's what that's
[30:36] saying
[30:38] all all these walls of differences
[30:41] and hierarchies all of that is torn down
[30:45] in jesus christ that's destroyed
[30:49] it's annihilated in christ outside of
[30:53] christ of course
[30:54] they still have that they continue that
[30:57] but truly for the true believer
[31:00] he knows that he has one master
[31:04] even christ and that all of you are
[31:07] brothers and sisters we're all
[31:09] equal we're all equally valuable did you
[31:12] hear that
[31:13] sisters
[31:17] young people you're all equally
[31:20] valuable do you have a different
[31:22] function than one another
[31:24] yeah sisters are not called to
[31:26] leadership positions
[31:28] in the local church or preaching
[31:30] positions in the local church
[31:32] but they're not called also not called
[31:34] to be
[31:35] spiritual weaklings amen they are
[31:39] this word brethren is a greek word
[31:43] that speaks of brothers and sisters it's
[31:45] the word
[31:46] delfoy which is neuter
[31:50] gender which means it's both men and
[31:53] women
[31:54] not just brothers
[31:57] as in the sense of male all of you
[32:01] are a delphi all of you are brothers and
[32:04] sisters
[32:05] we're all equally valuable there's no
[32:07] male or female
[32:09] in christ the female is not receiving
[32:11] her salvation
[32:13] in a subservient way through her husband
[32:17] male and female has done away with that
[32:19] doesn't mean roles
[32:21] and positions in the church and
[32:23] leadership
[32:24] is done away with as some take that
[32:27] but what it what it means is equal
[32:29] access
[32:31] same as jews and gentiles he says
[32:34] there's no
[32:35] difference between jews and gentiles
[32:38] that's a direct
[32:39] scriptural quote what and what does that
[32:41] mean
[32:43] there's no difference between ju we all
[32:45] have equal access
[32:47] what are gentiles gentiles is made up of
[32:49] every
[32:50] nation tongue and people group
[32:53] every color every tribe every language
[32:58] there's no difference between jews and
[33:01] gentiles
[33:02] all now have open and free access
[33:06] to christ and we can only come
[33:09] as individuals
[33:13] and where and again i want to emphasize
[33:14] on that sisters
[33:16] it's equal access your husband
[33:19] does not have more access to the spirit
[33:21] of god
[33:22] than you do he has a different position
[33:26] but you are called to not be
[33:29] a spiritual weakling but to be strong
[33:33] i think i did in a sunday school he said
[33:36] paul told the whole church quit you
[33:39] like men be men always writing to men
[33:43] and women
[33:44] well now he's not trying to confuse
[33:47] genders like we are today
[33:50] but what was he saying be strong be
[33:53] strong
[33:54] sisters he wants you to be strong he
[33:56] wants you to have a
[33:57] solid revelation and understanding of
[34:00] the truth of the bible
[34:02] he wants you to know how to communicate
[34:04] that to your children
[34:07] and to your sisters around you so that
[34:10] you can fellowship
[34:11] not just about what dress you're going
[34:13] to get
[34:14] that's fine but so you can fellowship
[34:17] around the word of god you're not
[34:20] lower than men
[34:23] that's a false teaching in a false
[34:26] doctrine
[34:28] you have a different position absolutely
[34:30] it doesn't make you lower
[34:31] doesn't make you have less access
[34:34] there's
[34:35] in christ there's neither male or female
[34:39] we have one master that's christ
[34:42] verse 9 and call no man your father upon
[34:45] the earth
[34:46] for one is your father which is in
[34:48] heaven neither be
[34:50] called masters for one is your master
[34:52] even christ
[34:53] but he that is greatest among you shall
[34:55] be your
[34:57] servant and whosoever shall exalt
[35:01] himself shall be abased
[35:03] and he that shall humble himself shall
[35:06] be exalted
[35:07] i'm going to be mentioning a couple
[35:09] times the chosen if you
[35:11] haven't seen it please see it but
[35:14] i think they did a brilliant job and i'm
[35:17] bringing this up here
[35:18] i understand the chosen is not scripture
[35:21] and there's things in it that are
[35:24] uh artistic license the the point i'm
[35:27] bringing up is
[35:29] everyone was taking turns to carry the
[35:32] carts as they're going from one place to
[35:33] another
[35:34] and jesus said oh it's my turn they're
[35:35] like no you don't do that oh no i like
[35:37] to do that
[35:38] some ways this uh manual labor is very
[35:41] simple
[35:43] uh and easy compared to what i'm doing
[35:46] right now
[35:47] and i thought this is marvelous that is
[35:50] the heart
[35:52] of a servant not to say i'm the messiah
[35:55] i'm the king of kings and lord of lords
[35:57] you shall you shall serve me and carry
[36:00] all the burden
[36:01] no he's out there he's ready to carry
[36:04] this cart he's down underneath working
[36:07] on someone's
[36:07] cart to help him that is the heart
[36:11] of christ to be a servant
[36:14] to do what you can to help people
[36:17] now it would not be a help to anyone for
[36:20] me to get under
[36:21] and start working on your vehicle
[36:25] but there's other things i can do to to
[36:28] to help you and be a blessing
[36:30] but what i'm saying is each of us has a
[36:33] different thing
[36:34] take what you have take what little
[36:36] thing
[36:37] you can do and use it to help
[36:41] other people to serve to say i didn't
[36:43] come to
[36:44] be served i came to serve
[36:48] verse 12 and whosoever shall exalt
[36:51] himself
[36:52] shall be abased and he that shall humble
[36:54] himself
[36:56] shall be exalted i've
[36:59] i don't want to call peop
[37:02] any names out but i've been to
[37:07] i've been to meetings and there the
[37:09] ministers are they're eating all the
[37:11] the best food and that's smoked on the
[37:13] smoker and it's
[37:15] the most wonderful thing and all the
[37:17] ministers there to just kick back
[37:18] enjoying
[37:20] these good things and everyone else is
[37:21] up eating the
[37:23] meager food at another place i thought
[37:26] my
[37:26] goodness that's not that's not the heart
[37:30] of of christ that
[37:33] i didn't i that broke my heart to think
[37:36] that
[37:37] you know the we as preachers should be
[37:40] more mature
[37:41] and up there serving the young people
[37:46] not beings not being served the the
[37:49] the steaks and the ribs and all this
[37:51] stuff while they're eating
[37:52] whatever it wasn't bad food they were
[37:54] eating but it was definitely lesser
[37:56] food and our heart
[38:00] should be different our heart should be
[38:03] one where we're ready to go wash
[38:06] people's feet
[38:07] now we do that as a symbol but in the in
[38:09] the day
[38:11] in the day of christ that was a real
[38:13] necessity
[38:15] and it was a job that someone took and
[38:17] christ
[38:19] went and did that and it was offensive
[38:21] to peter
[38:23] how will the king of kings and lord of
[38:25] lords bend down and be
[38:27] do the job of a slave
[38:31] because that is the way of god
[38:35] that is the heart of god christ was
[38:39] full filled with the heart of god
[38:41] whoever will exalt himself
[38:44] will be a base he'll be brought low and
[38:46] he that shall humble himself
[38:49] shall be exalted do you none of us
[38:52] should have it in our mind saying i want
[38:54] to be exalted
[38:56] right that's you're starting from the
[38:58] wrong motivation
[39:00] because the human nature when you say i
[39:02] want to be exalted you're going to do
[39:05] what you're not going to go and do the
[39:08] dirty
[39:09] thing you're not going to get involved
[39:11] with people that are unclean
[39:13] and i think
[39:16] sometimes we can have the approach
[39:20] in the message when we look and see
[39:23] that person doesn't fit the image
[39:27] and we just we we put a thing over her
[39:29] face and say
[39:30] unclean unclean we
[39:34] we laugh and it's funny but
[39:37] something's wrong in the in our heart
[39:40] when we take that approach and when we
[39:42] look at
[39:43] other people who are different than us
[39:46] and look down on them okay they've got
[39:49] spiked hair and it's a rainbow color but
[39:52] it's a soul
[39:54] it's a soul that's destroyed under
[39:58] the curse of satan in this day and our
[40:01] heart
[40:02] should not be looking down
[40:06] looking down our noses at people but we
[40:09] should be coming down on their level
[40:11] that's what christ did
[40:14] look at look at what he did in john 4
[40:17] i must needs go by samaria it's
[40:20] astonishing
[40:22] it's an astonishing thing that he did
[40:24] that
[40:25] jews and samaritans hated each other the
[40:28] samaritans were
[40:29] the ten tribes the jews were the jews
[40:32] were the
[40:33] uh judah benjamin and some and levites
[40:37] and so they they looked down on these
[40:40] samaritans samaria was the capital city
[40:43] of the the northern kingdom right and so
[40:46] they had
[40:47] a different worship they had a different
[40:49] bible
[40:50] they had a different approach and the
[40:52] jews looked down on them and they looked
[40:54] down on
[40:55] at the on the jews they despised each
[40:57] other
[40:58] and jesus said none of your nonsense
[41:02] matters to me
[41:05] there's souls that need i must needs go
[41:08] by
[41:10] samaria and there was that woman at the
[41:13] well
[41:14] yeah no one wanted her no one not even
[41:17] other women wanted to be around her
[41:19] and here he was going after that one
[41:23] that one soul
[41:27] you know it let us have that heart
[41:34] now i i'm sorry if i spoil
[41:38] season two episode three for you
[41:44] but um it's on my heart
[41:48] and it's part of what a quote that
[41:51] i came across from the quote of the day
[41:53] today that blew me away
[41:55] last night um watching the
[41:59] episode most of it jesus was in the
[42:01] background
[42:02] he had a healing line and the disciples
[42:06] are there they're taking shifts to
[42:07] manage the crowd and
[42:09] keep control of them and so forth during
[42:12] this time the disgust the disciples were
[42:14] discussing
[42:15] themselves the kingdom how they fitted
[42:19] in that fit into that the destruction of
[42:21] rome
[42:22] and then as the day went on jesus is at
[42:24] the healing line morning
[42:26] until late late at night as the day went
[42:29] on peter
[42:31] and and peter becomes angry
[42:34] at matthew the tax collector
[42:37] you you never you never apologized you
[42:40] made me do things
[42:41] i never would have done and he was angry
[42:45] they were blowing up and there's a blow
[42:46] up andrew says he's right
[42:48] he's not not he's not very nice to you
[42:50] but he's right
[42:52] you you did wrong and you've never
[42:54] apologized to us
[42:56] then james and john having been already
[42:58] rebuked as the sons of thunder
[43:01] stand up and say you can't do that so
[43:02] they're ready to go to blows
[43:05] they're arguing and they're ready to go
[43:07] blows and everybody has a different
[43:09] perspective
[43:10] and everybody is right
[43:13] from their perspective but they're all
[43:16] arguing they're all fussing they're all
[43:18] fighting with each other and they're
[43:20] ready to have a fist fight with each
[43:23] other and out of the darkness comes
[43:26] jesus staggering
[43:28] walking after praying for hundreds and
[43:31] hundreds and hundreds of sick people
[43:33] all day and as he as he walks they see
[43:36] he's he's staggering he can barely stand
[43:39] up
[43:40] and he there's so complete silence
[43:43] and he looks at them says good night and
[43:46] goes directly to his tent
[43:48] and he's got blood on his face his feet
[43:52] hurt
[43:53] he's tired what was he doing he was
[43:57] healing the sick
[44:00] he was ministering to the broken
[44:05] he was delivering people that were
[44:06] captive
[44:08] and what were his disciples doing
[44:10] fighting
[44:12] each other and and with a trembling
[44:15] heart somehow i feel
[44:18] some of us even around the message
[44:20] movement have come to this place
[44:22] we're busy fighting one another while
[44:26] jesus
[44:26] is healing the sick saving the lost
[44:31] and delivering the brokenhearted our
[44:33] whole
[44:34] focus sometimes gets wrong gets off
[44:38] me too our focus gets to the wrong thing
[44:43] and looks at the wrong thing and our
[44:44] attitude gets wrong
[44:46] and we get bad feelings and funny
[44:49] feelings about one another
[44:51] when jesus is saying you're my body i
[44:54] want to use you
[44:55] to heal the sick deliver the
[44:57] brokenhearted
[44:58] and save the lost what are you doing
[45:03] what are we doing what am i doing
[45:13] in the sermon be not afraid
[45:16] brother branham says i've had ministers
[45:19] say to me you better go see him because
[45:21] he's an influen an
[45:22] influential man in the city i don't care
[45:26] if he's a bum in the street
[45:27] so so drunk he can't move he's just as
[45:30] much as a mayor of the city
[45:32] in the sight of god because it's
[45:34] whosoever will let him come
[45:36] but we went after somebody else that was
[45:38] a movie star
[45:39] had some great pole or some tap dance or
[45:42] a modern jitterbug or whatever you want
[45:44] to call it
[45:46] god goes to the gutters go out in the
[45:50] streets and the highways and compel
[45:51] them to come in and remember that was
[45:54] the last call the church
[45:55] has gone off listen the church
[45:58] has gone on without him
[46:02] see you've gone on off on tantrums
[46:06] and don't think just because we're
[46:09] fought
[46:10] we we confess to follow the messenger to
[46:13] this
[46:13] age that we can't do the same thing
[46:17] that we can't go off into tantrums go
[46:19] off in the wrong direction
[46:20] have the wrong attitude wrong approach
[46:22] because we all know
[46:24] we all know and know many examples
[46:28] of these things happening and i'm not
[46:30] saying
[46:31] you are this one is our church is this
[46:34] art i'm not making a broad statement
[46:36] i'm talking to you and to me as an
[46:39] individual
[46:40] because that's what goes off the wrong
[46:42] direction
[46:43] and in the wrong way is individuals do
[46:46] that
[46:48] and then we do it as a group
[46:55] in a man running from the presence of
[46:57] the lord
[46:59] brother branham says how wishy-washy
[47:01] that's what's too many christians today
[47:03] are so
[47:03] soft-soaked and everything until they
[47:05] think all they do is join a church
[47:07] go in somewhere put their name on a book
[47:10] or do a little something jump up and
[47:12] down shout or something like that
[47:13] and call it christianity christianity is
[47:16] an everyday rugged life
[47:18] living for god in this in this present
[47:20] world
[47:21] it's a constant burning of the fire and
[47:24] love of god in the heart
[47:25] that sets you a fire and puts you out
[47:27] yonder with the people
[47:29] and making converts to christ
[47:32] responsibilities
[47:34] but it's easy to go the way the world
[47:36] goes
[47:37] it's easy to flow down the stream now i
[47:41] don't want you to push this off on
[47:42] somebody else when you say it's easy
[47:44] to go the way the world goes you can say
[47:48] well i'm not
[47:49] of this world think about it this way
[47:53] what is he talking about wishy-washy
[47:56] christians
[47:58] so that's the world that he's talking
[48:00] about
[48:02] don't put it don't even put it off
[48:04] that's just denominations
[48:06] because the spirit of denomination
[48:10] it starts out what as a deed
[48:14] it doesn't start out as a doctrine it
[48:17] starts out as a deed
[48:18] they haven't formalized it they just
[48:20] have the spirit
[48:22] of what that doctrine formally becomes
[48:26] so it's a it's a deed what is it it's a
[48:29] spirit
[48:30] we understand that by looking at the
[48:32] four horsemen four horse riders
[48:36] we understand it's a spirit and it looks
[48:38] so close
[48:40] to being right and and you're
[48:43] he says go out there and brother branham
[48:45] says it's easy to flow down the stream
[48:47] so there's
[48:48] the picture i see is there's a there's a
[48:50] stream going this way
[48:52] this is the easy message
[48:56] way to go down you fit in you look the
[48:59] part
[49:00] everything's nice everything's good and
[49:04] you're flowing down the stream it's easy
[49:09] go out there and set down in the river
[49:10] with your boat you get your oars
[49:13] and start pulling up against the current
[49:15] you don't make much time and it goes
[49:17] hard
[49:19] but you just want let once let loose the
[49:22] oars
[49:22] and watch how fast you pass the trees
[49:25] going down but look where you're going
[49:27] when things are floating easy remember
[49:29] you're going towards a great cataract
[49:31] down there of some sort you're going
[49:32] towards the falls
[49:34] and it won't be long you'll be going
[49:35] over that falls just floating with the
[49:37] world easy the way it goes you don't
[49:39] want that no sir
[49:41] but you must accept your responsibility
[49:45] now you believe it and you think it's
[49:46] the truth and the responsibility
[49:48] that god has given us in this day to
[49:51] bring this message
[49:53] and as i get older and i know my days
[49:55] are shortening up
[49:56] i feel the responsibility greater than i
[49:58] ever felt
[49:59] pressing on we must do it we must get
[50:01] down to it and everywhere we go and tell
[50:04] the message
[50:05] and tell the people that jesus christ is
[50:06] coming that he's god and he's coming
[50:08] soon
[50:09] there's not a hope left in the world but
[50:11] the coming of
[50:12] the lord amen so that's a responsibility
[50:17] that we have to make converts to christ
[50:22] to share the message wherever we go
[50:24] that's our responsibility
[50:28] and the way the way of the world is the
[50:30] easy way the wishy-washy way
[50:34] it's not sharing the message it's not
[50:36] being salt
[50:37] and light it's being weak it's trying to
[50:40] fit in
[50:42] but god's way is that rugged every day
[50:46] living for god it's a constant burning
[50:49] of the fire and love
[50:51] of god in the heart and you don't get
[50:54] that from a church walk
[50:57] you don't get that from being a groupie
[51:01] you get that from being individually
[51:04] connected
[51:06] to jesus christ
[51:12] we can we can get caught in that flow
[51:15] there's a flow and you get caught up in
[51:18] it
[51:19] into that flow and that flow can take
[51:22] you in the completely
[51:23] wrong direction we want to be sure
[51:27] that we're rowing with christ
[51:31] that we're going the direction that
[51:33] christ is going
[51:35] i brought two quotes there our
[51:36] responsibility is
[51:38] to share the message to make converts to
[51:40] christ
[51:41] the other the other quote what did it
[51:43] say god goes
[51:44] to the gutters not the popular places
[51:48] the easy places
[51:50] the people that smell right but the
[51:52] people that are lost
[51:53] that are broken what did christ go to
[51:58] the people that are lost that are broken
[52:02] people that are healthy they don't they
[52:05] don't need a physician
[52:06] the sick need a physician you are the
[52:09] body of christ
[52:12] the sick need a physician who is the
[52:14] physician
[52:16] you you are the physician
[52:20] christ in you the hope of glory so
[52:24] healing deliverance from
[52:27] from sin all these things come by the
[52:30] spirit of god
[52:31] sending you to someone who's broken
[52:35] amen who's hurt not just to anyone
[52:38] remember christ
[52:39] went to the pool of bethesda he didn't
[52:42] just blanket
[52:43] heal everyone he was led of his father
[52:46] directly to that one and he spoke the
[52:50] word to that one
[52:51] and that that's what came
[53:00] you as an individual have a mission
[53:04] given to you as an individual
[53:07] by god and he wants
[53:10] you to be connected directly
[53:14] to him to accomplish that mission
[53:17] every member of the body of christ
[53:21] every person that is filled with the
[53:22] spirit of god
[53:24] has a purpose and must
[53:28] be led by god
[53:31] in that purpose see i don't know exactly
[53:34] what my purpose is
[53:36] he made you it's not complicated
[53:40] he made you the way you are he prepared
[53:42] you look at the apostle paul
[53:44] now god could have made apostle paul
[53:46] like john the baptist
[53:48] a person that was completely outside
[53:51] of education outside of greek culture
[53:54] he could have sent him from a young age
[53:57] to the wilderness
[53:58] trained him up and he would have walked
[53:59] right in
[54:01] to the to christ and being a preacher of
[54:05] the gospel but god
[54:06] made it completely different he made him
[54:09] a religious fanatic pharisee
[54:13] he made him born in the city of tarsus
[54:17] to learn greek and no have a greek
[54:20] background
[54:21] he went and learned in a theological
[54:24] seminary
[54:26] and then he got called knocked off his
[54:28] high horse
[54:29] sent to the wilderness to have all of
[54:31] that beaten out of him
[54:33] and yet all of it was still there
[54:37] it didn't like he forgot the education
[54:40] that he had or he forgot
[54:42] about jewish traditions and customs he
[54:44] just
[54:45] took that all of that is done in
[54:47] comparison
[54:49] to the knowledge of christ in other
[54:51] words
[54:52] god took a man molded him from the time
[54:54] he was a little boy
[54:56] sent him through greek education jewish
[54:59] education
[55:01] allowed him to be a man fighting against
[55:03] jesus christ
[55:05] and then came and knocked him out of the
[55:07] horse
[55:08] and knocked him off his horse and
[55:10] brought him to the place where he used
[55:12] all of those experiences that led up to
[55:15] that point
[55:17] in subservience to christ alone
[55:22] think about that for a second he god
[55:24] didn't it wasn't
[55:25] men in black god didn't erase take a
[55:29] little thing and erase the memory
[55:31] of paul it's not what he did
[55:35] he took paul and he brought him to the
[55:37] place where everything was
[55:40] surrendered to christ
[55:43] everything was the education the
[55:46] background
[55:47] all of it meant nothing to him in
[55:50] comparison with the value
[55:52] of jesus christ so what's my point he
[55:55] made you
[55:56] he brought you through life experiences
[55:59] he's and
[55:59] all of that is training and purpose for
[56:02] god to use you
[56:03] for his purpose whatever that might be
[56:06] amen the things that you have a bent
[56:09] towards that you have a desire for what
[56:11] is it supposed to be used for
[56:14] get rid of your thinking and let christ
[56:17] use you in that thing that you're gifted
[56:20] at
[56:23] john 21 20
[56:27] through 22.
[56:37] then peter turning about sees the
[56:39] disciple whom jesus loved
[56:41] following which also leaned
[56:44] on his breast at supper and said lord
[56:47] which is he that betrayeth thee peter
[56:49] seeing him sayeth to jesus
[56:52] lord and what shall this man do
[56:56] so here peter sees john coming by after
[56:59] this conversation do you love me
[57:01] you know i love you back and forth feed
[57:03] my sheep
[57:04] then here we come what about
[57:07] any he's told basically told peter
[57:09] you're going to be
[57:10] taken and executed at the end of your
[57:13] life right
[57:14] and so peter says tell john's future too
[57:20] tell me what's going to happen to him
[57:24] if i will that he tarries till i come
[57:26] what is that to thee follow
[57:28] thou me what's john going to do what's
[57:32] his life going to consist of
[57:34] what does that do follow me
[57:39] well what if what if brother matt does
[57:40] this what is that to you
[57:43] follow me that's an individual call
[57:47] to peter peter is not to respond to
[57:50] john's purpose
[57:51] john's call or any of the other
[57:54] disciples
[57:55] he is to follow directly
[57:58] the leadership of christ we have one
[58:00] master
[58:01] even christ
[58:05] in the sermon divine healing in 1954
[58:07] brother branham says one of the biggest
[58:09] failures
[58:11] in the world is the church that's right
[58:13] churches has miserably failed
[58:15] everything has failed but we receive a
[58:18] kingdom which cannot fail
[58:20] jesus christ it cannot fail and we're so
[58:22] happy for that that it's not a church
[58:24] affair
[58:25] it's an individual affair it's not
[58:27] whether my church is saved
[58:29] it's whether i am saved it isn't whether
[58:31] my deacon is saved or my pastor is saved
[58:34] or my mother is saved
[58:35] it's whether i am saved or not myself
[58:38] i must be saved then i must tell them
[58:41] and then if they're saved wonderful if
[58:43] they're not
[58:44] i must still remain saved amen
[58:48] that's i must obtain my salvation oh
[58:52] what a wonderful day
[58:54] amen romans 8
[58:57] 14
[59:02] for many as are led by the spirit of god
[59:05] they are the sons of god
[59:10] every individual in the body of christ
[59:15] must be led by the spirit of god
[59:19] god wants and demands that our hearts
[59:24] alone belong to him
[59:28] we cannot be caught in the web of the
[59:31] influence
[59:32] of what everybody else is doing we have
[59:35] to be
[59:36] caught in the web of the leadership of
[59:38] christ
[59:41] we have to be in that reality
[59:44] not in the reality well i'm just doing
[59:46] what everybody else around me does
[59:48] no we're not we're not to do that
[59:51] we're to be led and molded
[59:55] personally by christ i mean
[59:58] obviously we understand god uses
[1:00:01] the five-fold ministry he uses pastors
[1:00:05] he he he works through them
[1:00:08] but they're not your master
[1:00:11] they are there for your edification for
[1:00:13] your personal building up
[1:00:15] so that your individual walk
[1:00:18] with christ can flourish
[1:00:22] that's the purpose of it they're not to
[1:00:24] be your holy ghost
[1:00:26] they're not to be your leader you
[1:00:29] have to be led you can
[1:00:32] go for advice you can go for asking
[1:00:35] questions
[1:00:36] but at the end of the day you can't just
[1:00:38] act upon
[1:00:39] someone's advice you have to pray
[1:00:43] and ask god to lead you
[1:00:46] as an individual
[1:00:50] we can't be in this position where we
[1:00:52] look around and
[1:00:53] we take a look at the people around us
[1:00:55] and say oh
[1:00:57] good i'm sure i'm being led by god now
[1:01:00] because everybody around me is just
[1:01:02] right my pastor is the right one and
[1:01:07] that doesn't mean anything it's
[1:01:09] important to have a good pastor
[1:01:11] it's important to have a good bible
[1:01:13] teaching ministry at your church it's
[1:01:15] imp
[1:01:15] it's important to have a spirit-filled
[1:01:17] worship team
[1:01:19] but what if you have none of that what
[1:01:22] if you're way off in
[1:01:23] some beaten path and you got somebody
[1:01:26] that
[1:01:27] you know they love the lord they're not
[1:01:29] very good preacher
[1:01:31] and you got a song leader and they're
[1:01:32] real bad
[1:01:34] now you can't go to heaven
[1:01:38] it's ridiculous but people approach it
[1:01:42] that way i've got to move to this church
[1:01:44] and then i'll be okay
[1:01:46] no no you can still be lost and go to
[1:01:50] hell
[1:01:51] judas had the best pastor ever
[1:01:55] and he had a great church that he was a
[1:01:57] part of
[1:01:58] but it didn't mean that he went to
[1:02:00] heaven
[1:02:03] and and so that's why we have to have
[1:02:05] our individual bond
[1:02:07] with jesus christ be at
[1:02:10] our complete absolute that has to be our
[1:02:13] absolute
[1:02:15] not our church and of course we can all
[1:02:18] say amen to that but
[1:02:19] really in your approach in your heart
[1:02:23] you have to live that because
[1:02:26] we can all say amen to that and then go
[1:02:28] say i sure am glad
[1:02:31] i'm at this church and this person's the
[1:02:33] pastor
[1:02:34] oh i just feel real satisfied
[1:02:37] okay i mean i'm i'm glad i'm here too
[1:02:41] that don't mean i'm going to heaven that
[1:02:43] don't mean i have the leadership of the
[1:02:44] holy ghost in my life
[1:02:47] that just means i'm at a good church
[1:02:56] on the day of pentecost the disciples
[1:02:58] each
[1:02:59] as individuals and then the the uh
[1:03:03] the pillar of fire broke apart they
[1:03:05] didn't all receive
[1:03:07] the pillar of fire and they were just
[1:03:09] joined at the hip one you know they
[1:03:11] broke apart
[1:03:12] as cloven tongues and they came into
[1:03:14] them as
[1:03:15] individuals they as individuals received
[1:03:18] the spirit of god and had
[1:03:20] an individual experience with
[1:03:23] christ that no one else could take away
[1:03:25] from them
[1:03:29] without that we have we haven't
[1:03:32] experienced salvation without that we
[1:03:34] can't
[1:03:35] be led by the spirit of god
[1:03:38] i love i love the
[1:03:41] apostle paul i think
[1:03:44] he's such an example you know you look
[1:03:47] at how
[1:03:48] how he handled things and dealt with
[1:03:50] things and
[1:03:51] it just amazes me but even you even look
[1:03:54] in galatians chapter 2 verse 11
[1:03:57] through 14 peter's coming for a little
[1:04:01] fellowship
[1:04:02] to antioch but when peter was come to
[1:04:05] antioch
[1:04:07] i was stood him to the face because he
[1:04:09] was to be blamed
[1:04:12] for before that certain came from james
[1:04:16] he did eat with the gentiles but when
[1:04:19] they were
[1:04:19] with come he withdrew and separated
[1:04:23] himself
[1:04:23] fearing them which were of the
[1:04:25] circumcision and the other jews
[1:04:27] dissembled likewise with them in so much
[1:04:29] that barnabas also was carried away with
[1:04:31] their dissimulation
[1:04:33] but when i saw that they walked not
[1:04:35] uprightly according to the truth of the
[1:04:37] gospel i said unto peter before them all
[1:04:40] if thou being a jew livest after the
[1:04:42] manner of the gentiles and not as do the
[1:04:44] jews why compel us thou the gentiles
[1:04:46] to live as do the jews he rebuked him
[1:04:50] in front of everyone what happened peter
[1:04:53] was scared of a group of
[1:04:56] people and he submitted his heart
[1:05:00] to this group in this situation
[1:05:03] before he submitted his heart to christ
[1:05:08] peter we understand peter was
[1:05:11] filled with the holy ghost he was the
[1:05:13] apostle of the jews
[1:05:15] he he under inspiration he wrote
[1:05:18] scripture
[1:05:20] he was the preacher on the day of
[1:05:21] pentecost to explain what was happening
[1:05:25] and yet he was carried away with
[1:05:30] my group is going to look down on me
[1:05:34] if i do this my group of preacher
[1:05:37] friends
[1:05:38] will kick me out
[1:05:43] and paul said i could care less
[1:05:46] about your groups of preacher friends i
[1:05:50] want to be true to christ no matter how
[1:05:54] they look at me no matter what they
[1:05:57] think of me
[1:05:58] i want to be obedient to him
[1:06:02] it's not about preacher groups every
[1:06:05] preacher has to be led by the spirit of
[1:06:08] god
[1:06:08] and if he's not he's doing what peter
[1:06:12] did
[1:06:14] at the very best he's doing what peter
[1:06:16] did which was
[1:06:17] making a grave mistake which he needed
[1:06:19] to needs to repent of and which
[1:06:21] i know i'm sure he did repent of
[1:06:27] in the sermon a hidden life 1955 brother
[1:06:31] branham says as our differences of life
[1:06:33] and fussing
[1:06:34] and quarreling amongst one another is
[1:06:36] the reason the veil
[1:06:38] can't drop behind us and we ca we can we
[1:06:40] can go into the
[1:06:41] presence into that presence of god
[1:06:43] that's right
[1:06:44] we're so interested in our denominations
[1:06:47] we're so interested in what the next
[1:06:49] fellow
[1:06:50] what what is that to thee follow thou
[1:06:54] me it's an individual affair between
[1:06:57] every minister
[1:06:59] how a minister ought to always get alone
[1:07:01] to himself
[1:07:02] even before he preaches before he prays
[1:07:04] before he does anything
[1:07:05] he should get alone with god in that
[1:07:07] quiet place hid
[1:07:09] away with god
[1:07:14] in the sermon abraham 1956 next thing
[1:07:17] what taken place
[1:07:19] there was lot when god said said
[1:07:21] separate yourself from everybody
[1:07:24] the walk with christ is an individual
[1:07:26] walk
[1:07:27] you walk you stand alone with you and
[1:07:29] god alone
[1:07:30] not you and the pastor you and god alone
[1:07:33] not you and the deacon sometimes you and
[1:07:35] your wife you and your husband but you
[1:07:37] and god alone
[1:07:39] you stand alone on your convictions
[1:07:42] salvation is not a church affair it's an
[1:07:44] individual affair
[1:07:48] in 58 the sudden secret going away of
[1:07:51] the church
[1:07:53] not only that but what a what if i would
[1:07:55] speak of the
[1:07:56] time of little stephen not a prophet not
[1:07:59] a pastor just a member of the body of
[1:08:01] christ
[1:08:02] how that this little fellow stood before
[1:08:04] the sanhedrin council that morning and
[1:08:06] spoke out to those
[1:08:07] who were condemning him and said you
[1:08:09] stiff necks uncircumcising hearts and
[1:08:11] ears you'd always resist the holy ghost
[1:08:14] as your fathers did so do you he wasn't
[1:08:16] a pastor
[1:08:18] you can't expect your pastor to do it
[1:08:20] all you can't expect your trustee board
[1:08:23] to do it all or your deacon board
[1:08:25] you've got to make ready make yourself
[1:08:28] ready it's an individual affair
[1:08:33] amen in what house will you build me
[1:08:37] 1965 we must look to the leading of the
[1:08:40] holy spirit
[1:08:41] but one thing that troubled me in coming
[1:08:43] here and to telling people well you
[1:08:45] should not come or you should come
[1:08:46] brother bran was talking about
[1:08:48] tucson he's telling he's
[1:08:51] people are saying should i move out
[1:08:53] there that's the one thing that troubled
[1:08:55] me in coming here into telling people
[1:08:56] well you should not come or you should
[1:08:58] come
[1:08:59] that i leave up to each individual the
[1:09:01] way that god
[1:09:02] leads that individual to do i think
[1:09:05] every one of us should do that
[1:09:07] be led by the spirit on what
[1:09:10] to do perfect faith 1963
[1:09:14] that's the way it is to all believers
[1:09:16] they're a mystic the people don't
[1:09:17] understand
[1:09:18] because they live in a world to
[1:09:20] themselves
[1:09:23] jesus lived in a world that nobody else
[1:09:25] could touch
[1:09:27] the type disciples couldn't understand
[1:09:29] him he spoke to them they say this and
[1:09:31] then they said what
[1:09:32] you talking riddles we don't understand
[1:09:34] this how can this be
[1:09:36] see they wasn't in the world that he
[1:09:37] lived in see they couldn't understand
[1:09:39] him nobody could understand him
[1:09:41] and so when a man lives by faith and
[1:09:43] walks by faith i mean substance faith
[1:09:46] he is isolated from the entire world and
[1:09:48] becomes a new creature in christ
[1:09:51] there now you're getting to bride
[1:09:52] material see you're getting into
[1:09:55] rapturing condition now that means for
[1:09:57] each one of us
[1:09:58] not just the pastor deacons trustees
[1:10:00] that means for the laity every
[1:10:01] individual walks in a world with god
[1:10:05] alone you're baptized into this kingdom
[1:10:08] and there's nobody in there but you
[1:10:10] and god see he gives the orders and you
[1:10:13] pack them out
[1:10:14] whatever he says there's not a shadow of
[1:10:17] doubt nowhere you walk right on
[1:10:19] if the lord says this there's nobody in
[1:10:21] the world can talk you out of it
[1:10:23] you go right on just the same now you're
[1:10:25] coming into perfect faith
[1:10:27] perfect perfection that cannot fail that
[1:10:29] faith never fails yes
[1:10:31] he was a mystic to them with his perfect
[1:10:34] faith and so is it now with those who
[1:10:37] have perfect faith
[1:10:38] are a mystic to others amen
[1:10:45] what is he saying there you're a mystic
[1:10:47] in other words
[1:10:48] what why are you doing that that's that
[1:10:51] makes no sense
[1:10:52] the lord is speaking to my heart and i'm
[1:10:55] being obedient to him
[1:10:57] well you could go and you could have
[1:10:59] these big huge meetings
[1:11:00] and you'd attract all the people no i
[1:11:02] want to go and talk to one
[1:11:04] samaritan woman and then she'll talk to
[1:11:06] everybody
[1:11:08] and they'll come to me that don't make
[1:11:10] any sense
[1:11:12] to the world but god can god can lead us
[1:11:16] in very strange
[1:11:17] and different ways that the world
[1:11:20] doesn't understand
[1:11:21] and we have to be ready to act on the
[1:11:24] way
[1:11:25] we're not purposely making crazy
[1:11:28] decisions
[1:11:28] no this don't try to mimic
[1:11:32] this if you mimic it you'll destroy your
[1:11:34] life
[1:11:35] this isn't something that can be
[1:11:37] mimicked by human
[1:11:39] understanding this is a relationship
[1:11:42] that you have
[1:11:43] and sometimes he says nothing and you
[1:11:45] sit still and sometimes he speaks
[1:11:48] and you go do something and it makes no
[1:11:50] sense to anybody
[1:11:51] but but you know and you understand why
[1:11:54] he told you
[1:11:55] and the purpose behind it
[1:12:01] galatians 1 1
[1:12:05] i read these verses and though
[1:12:09] it's paul speaking i just feel it
[1:12:10] resonating
[1:12:12] in my heart when i read it
[1:12:16] not that i look at myself as some
[1:12:18] apostle
[1:12:19] that's not the part about i'm looking at
[1:12:21] but paul an apostle
[1:12:24] not of men that part not of men
[1:12:29] neither by man but by jesus christ
[1:12:32] and god the father who raised him from
[1:12:35] the dead
[1:12:35] that's not just for paul the apostle
[1:12:38] it's for
[1:12:39] every son and daughter of god
[1:12:42] you can say tony son of god
[1:12:46] not of men neither by man but by jesus
[1:12:49] christ
[1:12:50] and god the father who's quickened me
[1:12:52] from the dead
[1:12:54] each of us have to have that
[1:12:57] testimony god raised me up
[1:13:01] it's god's purpose that he's called me
[1:13:04] i had someone on youtube comments last
[1:13:07] night say are you
[1:13:09] are you for brother joseph or are you
[1:13:12] against
[1:13:12] brother joseph and i said
[1:13:16] well brother i was called of god
[1:13:20] to the ministry not by any man
[1:13:24] and therefore it matters very little
[1:13:26] what other people are doing
[1:13:29] and neither does neither does that
[1:13:30] affect
[1:13:32] my calling it doesn't matter
[1:13:36] brother joseph is this brother joseph is
[1:13:38] that he's doing this wrong he's doing
[1:13:39] this right
[1:13:41] what is that to thee follow thou
[1:13:44] me now people people are carried away
[1:13:47] sometimes into
[1:13:48] false teachings and false doctrines and
[1:13:51] and of course we have to
[1:13:52] to to clarify things and take a stand
[1:13:56] but we do it in love
[1:13:58] we do it in kindness but if i'm for or
[1:14:01] against a person goodness i'm for
[1:14:03] everybody
[1:14:05] but as far as a certain ministry and
[1:14:06] following a certain ministry
[1:14:09] after the messenger this age
[1:14:12] not really into that
[1:14:15] we're supposed to be faithful to what
[1:14:17] the messenger taught
[1:14:19] not to our own thinking or some other
[1:14:21] one of our favorite preachers
[1:14:23] we're supposed to be led of the lord
[1:14:27] we have all kinds of wonderful preachers
[1:14:30] wonderful ministers that do
[1:14:31] so much good and people get delivered
[1:14:34] and healed and
[1:14:36] and and so forth but we're not we're
[1:14:38] we're not of them
[1:14:39] we have one master even christ
[1:14:48] let me skip ahead from
[1:14:52] the ephesian church age the church age
[1:14:55] book
[1:14:57] brother branham talking about
[1:15:00] the first messenger paul founded the
[1:15:02] church at ephesus about the middle of
[1:15:04] the first century
[1:15:06] and he talks about the beginning of that
[1:15:07] and he says his mannest manner of
[1:15:09] ministering
[1:15:10] set the pattern that all future
[1:15:12] messengers were to aspire to
[1:15:14] and actually sets the pattern for every
[1:15:17] true minister of god
[1:15:19] though he would not attain to such
[1:15:20] heights in the prophetic realm as paul
[1:15:22] did
[1:15:24] so he goes on to say paul's ministry at
[1:15:26] a three-fold
[1:15:27] quality i'll just briefly read those
[1:15:29] paul was first of all paul was
[1:15:31] absolutely true to the word
[1:15:34] he never deviated it from it no matter
[1:15:36] what the cost
[1:15:38] no matter what the cost notice that paul
[1:15:42] was unorganized
[1:15:44] but spirit-led as when god moved upon
[1:15:46] moses to lead israel out of egypt
[1:15:48] jerusalem's council
[1:15:50] never sent paul out nor did it have any
[1:15:53] power
[1:15:53] or jurisdiction over him god and god
[1:15:57] alone
[1:15:57] did the sending and the leading secondly
[1:16:00] his ministry was in the power of the
[1:16:02] spirit
[1:16:02] thereby demonstrating the spoken and
[1:16:04] written word
[1:16:06] thirdly he had the evident fruit of his
[1:16:08] god-given
[1:16:09] ministry now i want to look
[1:16:12] at the heart of paul and
[1:16:16] galatians 1 11.
[1:16:21] and we'll read gonna read extensively
[1:16:23] and that'll be the
[1:16:24] where i close but i certify
[1:16:28] you brethren and don't just take this as
[1:16:31] well it's for ministers because
[1:16:35] it's for all of us on our every one of
[1:16:37] us
[1:16:38] on our own level but i certify you
[1:16:41] brethren that the gospel which was
[1:16:42] preached of me is not after man
[1:16:45] for i neither received it of man neither
[1:16:47] was i taught it but by the revelation of
[1:16:49] jesus
[1:16:50] christ for us god used
[1:16:54] a man to deliver it to us but it has to
[1:16:57] transcend that and it has to be a
[1:17:00] personal
[1:17:01] revelation to our heart now god uses men
[1:17:05] to bring that for for the body of christ
[1:17:09] he brought it through brother branham he
[1:17:11] brings it through the five-fold ministry
[1:17:14] but yet it has to be a spiritual
[1:17:16] happening
[1:17:17] in your soul it can't merely just be
[1:17:21] knowledge it has to be by the revelation
[1:17:24] of jesus christ
[1:17:25] to you personally verse 13 for you i've
[1:17:28] heard of my conversation
[1:17:30] in time past in the jews religion how
[1:17:32] that beyond measure i persecuted the
[1:17:34] church of god
[1:17:36] and wasted it and profited in the jews
[1:17:38] religion above many my equals in my own
[1:17:41] nation
[1:17:42] being more exceedingly zealous of the
[1:17:44] traditions of my fathers
[1:17:46] but when it pleased god look at this
[1:17:51] the man who was wasting
[1:17:54] and persecuting the church of god still
[1:17:56] could say
[1:17:57] but when it pleased god who separated me
[1:18:00] from my mother's womb the chiefest of
[1:18:03] sinners
[1:18:04] still said he separated
[1:18:08] me from my mother's womb and called me
[1:18:11] by his grace
[1:18:14] you might have gone through all kinds of
[1:18:16] problems troubles
[1:18:17] difficulties you might look like the
[1:18:19] least
[1:18:20] one that's qualified to do what god has
[1:18:23] called you to do
[1:18:24] and yet god separated you
[1:18:28] from his mother's womb to fulfill the
[1:18:31] purpose that he has for you
[1:18:34] in your life in his in his life in you
[1:18:37] which is what to reveal his son in me
[1:18:41] it's not just for paul that's that's
[1:18:43] every believer
[1:18:45] is to have the son of god revealed
[1:18:48] through them that i might preach
[1:18:50] him among the heathen immediately i
[1:18:52] conferred
[1:18:53] not with flesh and blood
[1:18:58] interesting
[1:19:01] and yet god did send someone to him to
[1:19:03] pray for him
[1:19:05] right and baptize him
[1:19:08] but yet that vision and that revelation
[1:19:12] that paul
[1:19:13] had he didn't say hey i need to check
[1:19:15] this out he
[1:19:17] went forward he went forward in what god
[1:19:21] called him to do
[1:19:23] neither went i up to jerusalem to them
[1:19:25] which were apostles before me
[1:19:27] but i went up went into arabia and
[1:19:29] returned again
[1:19:31] unto damascus then after three years i
[1:19:34] went up to jerusalem to see peter and
[1:19:36] abode with him
[1:19:37] 15 days but of other of the apostles
[1:19:41] saw i none save james the lord's brother
[1:19:45] and now the things which i write unto
[1:19:46] you behold
[1:19:47] before god i lie not afterwards i came
[1:19:51] into the regions of syria and cilicia
[1:19:54] and was unknown by faith under the
[1:19:56] churches of judea which were in christ
[1:19:59] but they had heard only that he which
[1:20:01] persecuted us
[1:20:02] in times past now preaches the faith
[1:20:06] which once he destroyed and they
[1:20:09] glorified god in me
[1:20:12] then 14 years later musicians if you'd
[1:20:14] come
[1:20:16] then 14 years later after i went up
[1:20:18] again to jerusalem with barnabas
[1:20:21] and took titus with me also and i went
[1:20:23] up by
[1:20:25] revelation amen god revealed
[1:20:28] paul go up go up go do that isn't it
[1:20:31] interesting
[1:20:33] when paul was received that revelation
[1:20:36] everybody came and said the holy spirit
[1:20:39] says bonds and affliction
[1:20:41] await you in jerusalem he says why are
[1:20:45] you breaking my heart i don't
[1:20:46] this is this doesn't mean anything to me
[1:20:50] i'm willing to die for the sake of the
[1:20:54] gospel of jesus christ
[1:20:58] so he went up by revelation and the holy
[1:21:00] spirit is
[1:21:01] warning him and telling him in every
[1:21:03] place bonds and affliction await you
[1:21:05] isn't that interesting
[1:21:07] how the lord deals was that a test for
[1:21:10] paul
[1:21:11] saying well you could deliver yourself
[1:21:12] there's a whole lot of places you can go
[1:21:14] besides jerusalem
[1:21:16] and paul says i was revealed to me
[1:21:19] personally what these other people are
[1:21:21] saying i love them
[1:21:23] they don't want me to go they don't want
[1:21:25] to be me to be harmed
[1:21:26] but i need to follow christ
[1:21:30] no matter the cost and i went up by
[1:21:34] revelation
[1:21:35] and communicated unto them that gospel
[1:21:37] which i preach among the gentiles
[1:21:40] but privately to them which were of
[1:21:42] reputation lest by any means i should
[1:21:44] run
[1:21:45] or had run in vain but neither titus who
[1:21:48] was with me being a greek was compelled
[1:21:50] to be circumcised
[1:21:51] and that because of false brethren
[1:21:54] unawares brought in who came in privily
[1:21:58] to spy out our liberty
[1:22:00] which we have in christ jesus that they
[1:22:02] might bring us
[1:22:03] on into bondage
[1:22:06] look at here these are people
[1:22:09] that are in the church in jerusalem you
[1:22:12] have apostles
[1:22:14] and paul says you also have false
[1:22:16] brethren
[1:22:18] in the church who are trying and pushing
[1:22:21] for the gentiles to be under
[1:22:23] the law of moses and he says to whom
[1:22:27] we gave place by subjection no not for
[1:22:31] an
[1:22:31] hour look at the stand that he takes
[1:22:35] regardless regardless of the cost
[1:22:39] that the truth of the gospel might
[1:22:41] continue with you
[1:22:44] but of those who seem to be somewhat i
[1:22:46] love this
[1:22:47] whatsoever they were it makes no matter
[1:22:51] to me those who appeared to be
[1:22:54] important
[1:22:57] [Music]
[1:22:58] whatever they were it didn't matter to
[1:23:01] me
[1:23:02] god accepts no man's
[1:23:05] person god does not play favorites
[1:23:10] that way it doesn't matter
[1:23:13] they're popular they're the big shots
[1:23:16] they're in power
[1:23:17] paul says it makes no difference
[1:23:20] to me that is the heart that was the
[1:23:24] heart that brother branham had
[1:23:26] they said you should go see the
[1:23:27] important man of the city he said god
[1:23:29] goes to the gutter
[1:23:31] he looks deals with the man that's drunk
[1:23:34] on the street
[1:23:35] the same way he would deal with the man
[1:23:36] that's the mayor of the city
[1:23:41] for they who seem to be somewhat in
[1:23:44] conference
[1:23:45] added nothing to me but contrary wise
[1:23:47] when they saw
[1:23:48] that the gospel of the uncircumcision
[1:23:50] was committed unto me as the gospel of
[1:23:52] the
[1:23:52] circumcision wasn't to peter for he that
[1:23:55] wrought effectually in peter to the
[1:23:57] apostleship of the circumcision the same
[1:23:59] was mighty in me
[1:24:00] for the gentiles and when james cephas
[1:24:03] and john who seemed
[1:24:04] to be pillars perceived the grace that
[1:24:06] was given unto me
[1:24:08] they gave to me and barnabas the right
[1:24:10] hands of fellowship that we should go
[1:24:11] unto the heathen and they into the
[1:24:13] circumcision only they would
[1:24:15] that we should remember the poor the
[1:24:17] same which i also
[1:24:19] was forward to do the heart of paul
[1:24:23] following the leadership of the holy
[1:24:25] ghost no matter what
[1:24:26] it's an individual affair that's not
[1:24:29] just for paul
[1:24:31] you say well he was the messenger to the
[1:24:33] age he had something
[1:24:34] different he had something uh set apart
[1:24:37] from what i have well
[1:24:39] of course of course and yet his life he
[1:24:43] says follow me
[1:24:44] as i follow christ in other words he was
[1:24:45] an example
[1:24:47] to us to see and say this is how
[1:24:51] we can as individuals walk with christ
[1:24:55] we have this we have the same access
[1:24:57] that paul has
[1:24:59] different gifts different place in the
[1:25:01] body of christ
[1:25:03] but we have the same spirit of god
[1:25:05] dwelling in us
[1:25:06] we have the same god that wants to speak
[1:25:08] with us and
[1:25:10] lead us as individuals don't get
[1:25:14] caught aside into a church walk
[1:25:17] [Music]
[1:25:18] get further get deeper into christ be
[1:25:20] led by the spirit
[1:25:22] young people it's an individual walk
[1:25:25] between
[1:25:26] you and christ not you and your parents
[1:25:28] in christ
[1:25:31] yes of course there's relationships we
[1:25:33] all have
[1:25:34] human relationships and god governs
[1:25:37] those human relationships according to
[1:25:39] his commandments
[1:25:40] and yet you're not going to be saved
[1:25:43] through your parent
[1:25:45] you're going to be saved through god
[1:25:48] coming to you directly as an individual
[1:25:51] regardless of what your parents do now
[1:25:54] or in the future
[1:25:58] it's you and your heart and christ
[1:26:01] let's stand and pray
[1:26:05] heavenly father we love you
[1:26:09] we worship you lord we ask that your
[1:26:13] spirit would come and

[1:26:37] and you correct us
[1:26:38] and you convict us when we're wrong lord
[1:26:42] we shouldn't look at that as a bad thing
[1:26:44] it's the the most wonderful thing
[1:26:47] in this entire world to know that you
[1:26:52] care about us enough
[1:26:55] to come to us and say that was wrong
[1:26:58] [Music]
