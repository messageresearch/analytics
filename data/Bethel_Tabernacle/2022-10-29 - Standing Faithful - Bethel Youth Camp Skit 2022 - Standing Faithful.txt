this for you guys I'm very nervous and I don't even have any lines so just think how the other people must feel I decided I was going to give a little introduction because I made all these kids get up and do this and now I'm sorry so who was here last year okay so last year the skit was about making the right choice and this is a continuation of last year it is about once you've made your choice that now it's time to stand for it even if it's hard and scary you stand for your choice right um just pardon if you see any glitches we didn't have a lot of time to put this together so people are going to be trying to shuffle mics around just bear with us we have the front rows kind of know what's going on there's going to be times when they're cheering and you just follow along if you feel like it we want the energy to stay really good in here we don't want to feel boring because then the people on stage get nervous like I am right now so don't don't do that to them so just follow along if there's a video playing try to stay quiet so that everyone in the back can hear um I think that's all I needed to tell you guys oh there's also everyone's favorite character from last year is back so let's see if we can spot him foreign do we have any mics on that side foreign babylon's King Nebuchadnezzar came to Jerusalem and attacked it the Lord handed Judas King jehoicum over to Nebuchadnezzar along with some of the equipment from God's house Nebuchadnezzar took these to shinar to his own God's Temple putting them in his God's treasury Nebuchadnezzar instructed his highest official ashfinaz to choose Royal descendants and members of the ruling class from the Israelites young men without any physical defect handsome showing aptitude for every kind of learning while informed quick to understand and qualified to serve in the king's Palace he was to teach them the language and literature of the Babylonians the king assigned them a daily amount of food and wine from the king's table they were to be trained for three years after which they would serve before the king you will now be called Hammurabi next what is your name Benjamin you will not be called Ishtar that's a terrible name it's a fine Babylonian name you're lucky to have it what's your name Daniel you will now be called Belta shazar next what's your name Hannah Nile you you'll now be called Shadrach next what's your name Michelle Hebrew names oh you'll now be called Meshach next what's your name Azariah you did your parents want you to get beat up your new name is Abednego you've seen the food they expect us to eat almost everything there is unclean cafeteria food Brothers we cannot eat this we must speak with Ash pinatas sir we have a concern about the food do I look like a waiter sir we are unable to eat this food excuse me we are not in hebrewville anymore this is what we eat in Babylon God asks us not to partake of anything unclean and we must obey we asked them that we ask that we may be given only vegetables and water while we are here he could kill me no you must eat the King's food now what you are a steward correct I am please test us for 10 days allow us to eat our Sanctified diet and then compares to the other men 10 days okay but do not tell last-minute that dude is unstable man down there you can trust for the name of Daniel he had three more Shadrach Meshach and Abednego so he knew he could trust them so he told him not to I want the the law the Locust in his heart that he would not defile himself of the king's needs that's just exactly when you say you're going to do anything go to accept your healing or you're going to accept your the baptism the Holy Ghost that's where the devil flies on you with all four feet that's right when he got down there he said what he was going to do the king come around seen his excellent spirit and Daniel so he said now you put them fellows over there and feed him I guess the doctor come along and said now look they'd eat plenty of vitamins so I tell you you got to give him some wine some hard drinks and some uh affecting things a whole lot of calories in it a lot of meat and a lot of stuff the king said I'll feed them all bone table but when they come down to Old Daniel Amen they met somebody there love the Lord God come in or you say now look here said here's a dish the king sit down to just look how it looks a great big gobbler full of whiskey sitting on it so now the king wants you to be happy so he's just going to give you some of this now keep the steam laid up he said I just won't drink it voice and I'm and I'm free my own life and yours said I'll tell you what you do that you just give me pause for 10 days and then it'll be over amen otherwise a little line is little some corn pone or whatever you want to call it just skinny a little of it for 10 days and then examine me against the rest of them together and be in the kingdom of God I'd rather take my with a bunch of little holy rollers and live in the presence of God than the bombs the biggest church in Chicago and be out of the kingdom of God all right as always I'm joined by the Hall of Famer himself Troy Aikman Troy uh likewise Joe good to be with you today I'm super excited as a former InterContinental world champion myself I've uh body slammed a few Hebrews in my day uh today is going to be a briska 117 a nice little cold front moving through the Middle East right now my goodness Troy did you just say 117 degrees I did it's really nice out there it's actually considered a cold front here in the Middle East well Troy you're certainly making me miss summers in South Carolina let's not keep the games waiting anymore first up we have the arm wrestling match between Abednego and the Babylonian Warrior Hakeem I like to kill and they're off uh it looks like they're trying to pull the opponent's arm down towards the table I believe that's exactly what they're doing Troy wow that's an interesting strategy I guess must be some kind of Babylonian technique oh it's a struggle and he's looks like all the Hebrew pulls out the upset unbelievable wow that is that's really surprising I I was going for Babylon on that one for sure me too Troy and we're off with rock paper scissors and here they go wait scissors beats Rock since when I'm pretty sure that okay well let's move on to the next match I think this is the best of three today so one two three shoot is that how that goes I think that is how that goes Troy haven't played since junior high this is the last round I think I think the Babylonians have got this one race how how did that happen Hebrew with the win then he cut the competition up with that one [Applause] well we're up for our weight lifting competition let's see who can pull the win out here Troy oh we got to go with Babylonian on this one because uh the vegetarians there's no way they can win right and they're off look at that form wow that's really good right there yep man I see veins popping out of his neck Troy I'm pretty sure that he was going on The Struggle Bus over here for Babylon how's this happening and the Hebrew pulls out the wind this is quite the upside I think there's cheating going on the strength of these Hebrews is astonishing Troy yeah especially for carrot diet we're down to the last game I cannot believe it and uh how are we 2-0 right now foreign [Music] [Music] [Applause] well Joe I can't believe this I guess better luck next time huh well that's pretty much a clean sweep for the Hebrews well that's it for us today folks [Applause] foreign [Applause] you and your friends have exceeded my expectations your God's laws are wise and effective maybe I'll try the Hebrew diet keto isn't really working for me [Applause] [Applause] [Music] foreign [Applause] don't forget to put the mic back when you're done okay foreign I already got it thank you in the second year of his Reign Nebuchadnezzar had dreams his mind was troubled and he could not sleep so the king summoned The Magician's enchanters Sorcerers and astrologers to tell him what he had dreamed when they came in and stood before the king he said to them I've had a dream that troubles me and I want to know what it means then the astrologers answered the king May the King live forever tell your servants dream and we will interpret it the king replied to the astrologers if you do not tell me what my dream was and interpret it I will have you cut into pieces and your house turn into Rubble but if you tell me the dream and explain it you will receive gifts and rewards and great honor so tell me the dream and interpret it for me once more they replied let the king tell his servants to dream and we will interpret it then the king answered I am certain that you are stalling for time because you realize that if you do not tell me there is only one penalty for you you have conspired to tell me misleading and wicked things hoping the situation will change so then tell me the dream and I will know that you can interpret it for me the astrologers answer the king there is no one on earth who can do what the king asked no King however Great and Mighty has ever asked such a thing of a magician enchanter or astrologer what the King asks is too difficult no one can reveal it to the king except the gods and they do not live among humans this made the king so Furious that he ordered the execution of all the wise men of Babylon so men were sent to look for Daniel and his friends to put them to death when ariak the commander of the King's Guard had gone out to put to death the wise men of Babylon Daniel spoke to him with wisdom and tact he asked the king's officers why did the king if she's such a harsh decree ariak then explained the matter to Daniel at this Daniel went into the king and asked for time so that he might interpret the dream for him then Daniel returned to his house and explained the matter to his friends hananiah Michelle and Azariah he urged them to plead for Mercy from the god of Heaven concerning this mystery so that he and his friends might not be executed with the rest of the wise men of Babylon during the night the mystery was revealed to Daniel in a vision then Daniel prays the god of Heaven blessed be the name of God forever and ever for wisdom and power belonged to him now the King Nebuchadnezzar he was a hearty man he said look what I have done then the lord gave him a dream and it's troubling and when he did he saw a great image and noticed the accuracy of God's Eternal Word King Nebuchadnezzar seen an image with a golden head and it's resting here was silver and his thighs were cracked and his feet was iron clay now notice how those kingdoms the salt this material is gold the Nets coming harder net is Silver the next is brave and the hardest of all of them is iron iron is the heart and notice how the Gentile world would start it would start a song then it's keeping harder and harder and harder and harder until it finally went out into the clay and iron mixed together and each one of those kingdoms now think 2500 years ago a single person that purpose in their heart that they would serve the law and would not be Father's Death Foretold this day to the knobs and every other age coming down foreign [Applause] [Music] yes great Kink many gods are certainly responsible for our success you know I think it's about time people recognize the great power of both chazar and the King he serves well King I am experienced in such matters and typically I don't name drop but I did advise the kings of Hebrew and belt the shazar his own home country [Applause] that's just hurtful what do you suggest well it's like I say when in doubt build an idol we'll build a great statue to Belt a shazar everyone loves worshiping a Graven image especially when it's mandatory and to me Aspen as your majesty may you live forever please don't kill me make an announcement to my citizens at the sound of music playing almost bow and worship at the image of Belton that that disobey shall be thrown into a Den of Lions Lions my Lord doesn't that seem a little like you know impractical I guess you're right it can't always be hungry we'll throw him into my furnace yeah that's better all right foreign [Music] [Applause] I want you to notice as soon as the king saw this vision and he made it he forced every person in his kingdom in his domain to worship the Demi he made an enemy and it's believed by scholars in which I do believe that a Spirit-filled person would see it that that he worshiped Daniels what he did and he made an image to Daniel and he called it Bell the pleasure he called Daniel Bell to pleasure which was the name of his God and he made an image and forced every person to worship that eating I want you to notice that the beginning of the Gentiles when God dealt with them they got party in their heart and forced every man to worship the image of a holy man and the Gentile age was issued in with that it will go out in the same way the same way of of pouring cup of the mark of the beast that will force people to worship images and to do the things that we've been taught that was contrary to the word of God and brother it'll be so slick and fly until it will receive the very easy not deposit I'll show you a better purpose in your heart tonight and be filled with God's holy spirit that you'll be able to discern her right among them when the population is issued a Hallelujah thank God Benjamin Benjamin hey it's Char now are you here to check out the image it's great to finally see a Hebrew getting some recognition around here Benjamin I am in Ishtar Daniel will be furious at this people worshiping him instead of God this is idolatry come on guys I'm just following just following your face to myself furnace Babylonian living has corrupted you Benjamin yeah well at least I'm living bye [Music] [Applause] [Music] bye there they are your highness these delinquents refuse to worship a Graven image surely not lose they're some of my most trusted advisors oh King it is true we worship the one true God Jehovah and we will not bow down to any Graven image but your lives depend on it how dare you refuse to show loyalty to the great belt of shazar we can't worship Daniel we only worship His God our God is able to Deliver Us from the furnace but we will not bow to your image then we'll burn the religion out of you and then what God will deliver you got an awful picture here under consideration now of a Believer going to his death but let's turn our camera tonight towards heaven and while things are going on down here there's something going on up there [Music] the year was 500 BC and the entire host of heaven was watching a scene unfold when the king's decree went forth the Angels began Reckoning with the captives in Babylon might do after all idolatry was the reason they had all ended up in Babylon to begin with idolatry a way to fit in God's chosen people had commonly spurned the thing that set them apart from other nations a relationship with Jehovah in exchange for relations with other countries and their Idols would the Hebrew people break generations of weakness and defy their Babylonian Masters join us as we find out [Music] foreign [Music] can you say your name and your position for our viewers I'm the Archangel Gabriel captain of the Lord's hosts Gabriel take us back to that day how did things start all of heaven was on the edges of our seats we were hopeful for just a few servants be washed as one by one Babylonians into Hebrews alike fall to the image and how did that make you feel when you saw everyone bowing this image I was disappointed everyone was after generations of watching the Israelites fall into idolatry the anticipation grew for a few courageous men I am the Archangel Michael I sit at the right hand of the master how did you feel when you saw everyone bowing to this image well it was distressing I've spent centuries helping Jehovah protected people it's never easy to watch them fail I was the first one to notice them as the captain of the host I'm always vigilant for displays of Courage when I saw these three Hebrew boys refusing to Bow I knew these are true Warriors foreign did you notice the Hebrews refusing about Gabriel pointed out the young men to me I immediately knew they were among those who sit in prayer to the almighty no other human could possess such strength unless they knew Jehovah as the angel who sits at the right hand of God himself I am well acquainted with his presence I am wormwood I'm over the many Waters in The Fountains of the deep at what point did you notice the Hebrews I could feel a change in the atmosphere before I noticed the three Hebrews refusing to kneel there's always a change in the atmosphere before something important these men had already captured our attention by defying the king when they had refused his unclean table we had all washed with pride back then but now a great concern was arising amongst the angels these Faithful Servants who had never even glimpsed the reality of the most high had just sealed their fate in loyalty to him how did watching the children of Israel remain faithful affect you first I wondered what our orders would be the Lord normally tells us what to do in these kind of situations the orders never came in like many of my brothers I felt a great deal of relief but what now these men had just chosen a furnace of fire I knew I had to protect them what action did you take I rushed to the throne room to receive my orders I said master have you looked down to Babylon today three True Believers they're at their ends let me go down there I'll change the scene in just a few minutes so what action did you take I went with Gabriel to the throne I was ready to wipe out Babylon just like we did with Sodom and Gomorrah when the father looked at me I said look down there there are men who are walking in your provided way willing to seal their testimony one more step and death is right before them let me go and finish this [Music] what action did you take I followed Gabriel Michael from Shirley the master had noticed a course of events Lord I said have you considered they're about to burn up three faithful believers you gave me the keys to the Great Waters and the antidote moving to destruction I poured water all over the Earth let me go down there I will wash all of that one away and how did the Lord react he said I've been watching them all night long I watched even The Sparrows and I've seen my servants in Babylon today you've been a faithful companion Michael but this is a man-sized job he just raised his hand and said I would let you all go but I can't he stood up in his Priestly robes and he said you've been a good angel [Music] and you've always obeyed my orders that I'm going myself I'm going myself I'm going myself [Music] and what did God do next he pointed at the Thunderhead growing in the North he spoke to it I can still hear him call the winds north south east and west everything in the heavens obey him he stepped off his throne onto this Thunderhead like a chariot he reached over and he hooked the Four Winds to the Thundercloud like four massive Celestial horses he rode down to Babylon on that Chariot of Thunder cracking lightning like a whip finally right then and there he had picked the right man for the job and as he passed the Sea of life he picked up a palm to Fan the Flames when he arrived after the countless times that God sent an angel to carry out his commands when he saw these young Hebrews standing for him he left his throne to stand with them [Music] I watched them all night long I heard him in the prayer meeting last night I heard him when they prayed too and this struck Heaven here with their prayers I lost him I know they got one more set to go I've been watching them all night long I can't let you go because it's a man's side job I'm going myself he's still watching tonight watching me he's watching you he's watch where we'll stand or not stand what decisions we will make whether we'll stand straight to the word or get away from it it's later than you think [Applause] laughs foreign [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] baby [Music] [Applause] [Music] did we not tie up three men yet I see four in the fourth is as the Son of God Shadrach Meshach Abednego come out great is the god of Shadrach Meshach in the Bendigo for no other God can deliver like this [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] homes [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] keep playing my videos [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] I know [Music] [Music] so so long to my old friends [Music] you're

okay yeah [Music] [Applause] [Music] foreign [Music] take it out here [Music] oh build my heart foreign [Music] thank God foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] oh my God [Music] [Music] praise God before we sing this next song I want everybody in here to understand the prophet of God said this is the quietest place we'll ever be and the reason why he said that is can you imagine being in heaven after you've come through later this year and you see the master and you think you're gonna be able to keep your compulsion think about that when you see the one who's done everything for you you think you're gonna be able to sit there and say foreign I'm gonna lose my mind I'm Gonna Lose Myself and I don't care who's looking at me [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] foreign [Music]
