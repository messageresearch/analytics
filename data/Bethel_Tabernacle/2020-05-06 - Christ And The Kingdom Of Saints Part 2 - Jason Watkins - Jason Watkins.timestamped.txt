[31:31] Luke 17 we're going to go back to our
[31:34] text from Sunday amen and we're going to
[31:39] take apart to want to go take a little
[31:41] further announced Sunday that we would
[31:43] have this in a series and so I only have
[31:47] one prayer request that came in from
[31:50] brother Luther so if you have one you
[31:52] want to get it to me make sure you send
[31:54] it to me personally on on whatsapp
[31:57] that's what
[31:57] monitor I can't look at all the places
[31:59] even though I make a mad dash to try to
[32:01] do it every service but it's helpful if
[32:04] everything can come into one place and
[32:06] we catch all of our prayer requests amen
[32:09] Luke chapter 17 we're just going to read
[32:11] we read lengthy version of it Sunday
[32:14] were preaching continuing Christ in the
[32:17] kingdom of Saints we want to catch
[32:19] verses 6 through 10 and the Lord said if
[32:27] you had faith as a grain of mustard seed
[32:30] you might say unto this sycamore tree be
[32:34] thou plucked up by the root and be thou
[32:36] planted in the sea and it should obey
[32:39] you but which of you having a servant
[32:43] plowing or feeding cattle will say unto
[32:46] him by and by when he has come from the
[32:49] field go and sit down to meet and will
[32:52] not rather say unto him make ready
[32:55] wherewith I may sup and gird thyself and
[32:58] serve me till I have eaten and drunken
[33:01] and afterward thou shalt eat and drink
[33:04] doth he thank that servant because he
[33:07] did the things that were commanded him I
[33:09] think not so likewise ye when ye shall
[33:13] have done all those things which are
[33:15] commanded you say we are unprofitable
[33:19] servants we have done that which was our
[33:22] duty to do let's pray father I thank you
[33:26] for your word now Lord I thank you for
[33:29] your fresh anointing that I feel upon me
[33:32] lord I thank you for every tidbit of of
[33:37] inspiration you've given me Lord I this
[33:40] burden is upon my heart and I've just
[33:42] pondered it all throughout the day Lord
[33:45] since early morning keeping my mind just
[33:47] reserved Lord to come minister now I
[33:50] pray you'll anoint it to the hearer your
[33:54] word of course has already anointed its
[33:56] speakers and hearers that need it Lord
[33:58] so we're committing ourselves to you and
[34:00] humbling ourselves before your presence
[34:02] we commit it now to you it's your
[34:04] service in Jesus Christ's name Amen god
[34:08] bless you friends as you're seated
[34:11] christ and the kingdom of saints you
[34:16] know it the bible promises in the book
[34:20] of Revelation that the kingdom will be
[34:23] given to the Lord and His Christ and of
[34:27] course we have proven and shown you in
[34:29] teaching many times that's a reference
[34:31] to the Lord Jesus that's a reference to
[34:34] mr. and mrs. Jesus Christ that's a
[34:37] reference to the Lord Jesus Christ and
[34:39] his bride to our Lord and His Christ
[34:43] because we realized that Christ is it is
[34:46] a broad term that means the anointed
[34:50] word or when the word is made manifest
[34:52] that becomes Christ and so hence brother
[34:56] Branham could make a reference to
[34:58] Jeremiah and say Jeremiah was Christ
[35:01] because he was the anointed Word the
[35:04] Bible so much this this principle is so
[35:08] plain that when the anointing of God and
[35:12] the presence of God and the Word of God
[35:14] came into Moses that literally his his
[35:18] his countenance shone and they it was so
[35:24] bright they couldn't look at it and they
[35:26] had to veil his face and the Bible
[35:29] actually said Moses was God to the
[35:33] people and and brother Branham says when
[35:36] that word was inside him then he was the
[35:40] Living Word he was God to the people he
[35:42] said and then when he gave out that word
[35:45] then he went back to being Moses again
[35:48] now that's an amazing statement but we
[35:51] realized that during that day the the
[35:55] life of God could not remain inside of
[35:59] us like that it could come upon Moses it
[36:02] could come upon prophets it could come
[36:04] upon David it could move through them
[36:06] and speak through them it could it could
[36:09] have a an effective baptism upon John in
[36:13] his mother's womb but we realized that
[36:16] the first time the Holy Spirit came and
[36:19] remained on a vessel and didn't ever
[36:21] have to leave was on the Lord
[36:24] Jesus until Calvary's cross death burial
[36:28] resurrection ascension and then he sent
[36:31] back that life into his church his body
[36:33] his bride and now now that's why brother
[36:37] Branham would say she is him he would
[36:41] say things like that when a saint of God
[36:43] I quoted this Sunday how that would any
[36:45] believer takes not any promise of God
[36:48] and puts it upon your lips and speaks it
[36:50] with faith that's the exact same as deed
[36:53] he speak in all heavens and earth move
[36:55] under the power of those words and so we
[36:59] realize that that the Lord Jesus was
[37:02] building a kingdom we talked about it
[37:04] extensively on Sunday don't need to go
[37:07] back and cover all of that again but we
[37:10] covered in depth about God's great
[37:13] purpose from eternity and he was not you
[37:18] know I it's amazing that people imagine
[37:21] that Calvary is just you know sometimes
[37:25] I wonder the way they teach the purpose
[37:27] of God it's almost like God was just
[37:29] playing a dice game and just rolling the
[37:32] dice well let me go down and here's a
[37:34] good idea I can't seem to save the world
[37:36] I've been trying for four thousand years
[37:38] Oh Eureka I got it I'll go down and live
[37:41] as a man and I'll die a death and get
[37:43] hung on a cross and maybe somebody will
[37:45] believe finally you know God did not
[37:48] send Christ
[37:50] he did not come in Christ on an
[37:52] uncertain errand God knowing the end
[37:55] from the beginning purposed the death
[37:58] burial resurrection of Christ and
[38:00] purposed your life to be here so that
[38:03] you could receive that life and because
[38:05] his whole plan from Genesis and before
[38:08] Genesis is recorded God had a vision of
[38:12] a kingdom a kingdom of saints a kingdom
[38:18] a replication of himself a
[38:21] multiplication is a better word of
[38:23] himself God would not simply create a
[38:27] family here is the beauty of their of
[38:31] the opening of the seventh
[38:34] to restore back the original teaching of
[38:36] the early church it restores you to a
[38:38] truth that soul passes by denominational
[38:42] understanding of the Godhead that we
[38:45] find out that God didn't just create a
[38:48] family actually God became a family and
[38:53] that's why it is a legitimate I want to
[38:57] tell you tonight it is a legitimate
[38:59] statement it is not hyperbole it is not
[39:02] a parable it is not a metaphor to say I
[39:06] am a part of God I came from God I am
[39:11] identified as coming from him because I
[39:13] have the ability they're very unique
[39:16] ability to say amen to every word of God
[39:21] nothing that I did of myself to married
[39:24] it but I was simply came from the
[39:27] elected son Christ was the elected son
[39:31] and I came from Christ I am part of him
[39:34] and it's not wishful thinking in fact is
[39:39] if I was going to go based on what I
[39:41] thought I would never include myself in
[39:44] such a station but but I cannot deny
[39:47] that this screams a man inside my heart
[39:50] I can't stop it I can't make it come I
[39:54] can't make it leave when I read these
[39:56] words every fiber of my being says yes
[39:59] sir Amen Lord be it unto me Lord you
[40:04] can't bring yourself there you can't
[40:08] make yourself that grace grace God's
[40:14] grace hello my friends
[40:18] of course we've taught it many times
[40:21] before God gives a legitimate chance for
[40:24] every man to save himself
[40:26] God loves life takes no pleasure in the
[40:31] death of anything or anyone not even
[40:32] sinners not even people who reject him
[40:34] he doesn't take pleasure in the fact
[40:37] that they destroyed themselves he offers
[40:41] salvation to all but that's that's a
[40:44] different level than what we're talking
[40:45] about today we're talking about
[40:47] out we're talking about origin we're
[40:49] talking about genes we're talking about
[40:51] a seed gene of the Word of God I believe
[40:58] this word because what's in me and this
[41:02] word and the one who wrote this word is
[41:05] all the same substance it's all the same
[41:09] substance that's the beauty that is what
[41:13] the Seventh Seal opened to us it as I've
[41:16] said many times that was what was
[41:18] missing in the Trinitarian formula they
[41:21] they couldn't see husband and wife they
[41:23] simply saw three individual gods the
[41:26] oneness the Unitarian all they see is
[41:28] Jesus only they don't they don't include
[41:31] his body in their formula that the bride
[41:34] the kingdom of saints is part of the
[41:37] mystery of the Godhead hallelujah and we
[41:45] found out Sunday that God is bringing
[41:48] all of those whose origin was in him he
[41:53] is bringing you you say what is my life
[41:56] about what has it been about you know I
[41:59] say brother Jason I've got a pretty
[42:01] reckless past and I've got a history I'm
[42:03] not proud of I don't I don't
[42:06] I'm not even caring about that I'm here
[42:09] to tell you that from the day you
[42:11] breathe there God was bringing you to a
[42:13] vision a vision that he had of you in
[42:17] himself before the foundation of the
[42:19] world and it's a very lovely vision it
[42:22] is a state of perfection and you you've
[42:25] got to realize that your life here is
[42:29] being brought to his vision of you and
[42:33] we made that we made the inference last
[42:36] Sunday that you don't want to run afoul
[42:40] of that many people many of God's family
[42:45] his elect family his genes bring injury
[42:49] to themselves to repeat myself from
[42:52] Sunday run themselves up onto the rocks
[42:55] and get all cut to pieces
[42:57] uh you know they're you know because
[43:00] there God has a plan for them they run
[43:03] afoul of that and they they end up you
[43:05] know in the rocks and bust it up and so
[43:09] you want to as soon as you possibly can
[43:12] find the wherewithal don't wait when the
[43:15] Holy Spirit calls you listen up young
[43:17] people when the Holy Spirit calls you
[43:19] repent immediately go ahead and take the
[43:22] plunge and give your whole life to the
[43:24] Lord Jesus Christ I promise you you have
[43:27] a much more blessed life I don't care
[43:30] what the circumstances end up I'm
[43:32] talking about your life will pattern the
[43:34] vision God had of you amen
[43:38] so we found that that we closed off son
[43:43] to hell that Satan was trying had always
[43:45] tried to kill the holy child tried and
[43:48] he tried to get it he's trying to stop
[43:51] the seed he's trying to stop this
[43:52] kingdom from coming so he tries to kill
[43:56] Abel it didn't work God replaced him
[43:58] with Seth he comes along and you know he
[44:02] we seen the patterns in the scripture I
[44:04] don't want to just keep going through
[44:05] them all you know that we saw that Esau
[44:08] was determined to kill Jacob but God
[44:10] preserved him and wouldn't let it happen
[44:12] we see that Judas betrays Jesus and
[44:17] Satan thought he had him there but he
[44:18] didn't have him and he's been hunting
[44:20] him he tried to kill Moses and God
[44:23] protected Moses he tried to he did kill
[44:26] Jesus and that was by God's allowance
[44:28] Jesus said I lay my life down I pick it
[44:33] back up again said to Pilate you have no
[44:35] power except what my father gives you
[44:38] and the only power he's going to give
[44:39] you is whatever accomplishes his
[44:41] purposes so you just remember that
[44:43] friends if you believe that your
[44:45] intellect gene of God I don't care
[44:47] what's happening in your life understand
[44:49] that for whatever reason in God's
[44:51] discretion it's being allowed now it
[44:54] might be that God's teaching you a
[44:55] lesson because you're running afoul of
[44:57] the vision I don't know my my advice to
[45:00] you if you think that you're off of his
[45:02] perfect path you better stop drop and
[45:04] roll close you're on fire hey man come
[45:09] up here and I'll I'll throw a blanket
[45:11] over you and try to put it out and we'll
[45:12] get you get you born again of the Spirit
[45:15] of God and then you'll be burning from
[45:16] the inside hey man that was the
[45:19] advantage John had friends you know
[45:21] that's why a submarine can handle depth
[45:23] because pressure on the inside is
[45:25] greater than pressure on the outside
[45:26] otherwise pressure on the outside would
[45:28] crush the hull you get down and it's me
[45:30] it's many tons per per inch no they
[45:33] couldn't build a steel hull strong
[45:35] enough that I'd do it mater building out
[45:36] of titanium it wouldn't matter you go
[45:38] down deep enough and it'll crush it if
[45:39] there's no pressure inside pushing out
[45:41] the outside pressure will push in that's
[45:44] why when they tried to boil John and a
[45:46] vat of boiling oil
[45:48] they couldn't burn him on the outside
[45:50] cuz the fire he had on the inside was
[45:52] greater than what was on the outside
[45:54] yeah a man that that's a point I made in
[45:58] the very first sermon I ever preached I
[46:00] pulled that one up out of mothballs it
[46:02] wasn't in my notes and I was sitting
[46:04] here thinking about it ah but I want
[46:06] that fire on the inside now I want to
[46:11] take a practical turn tonight if you
[46:13] will indulge me to let me take about
[46:16] 3540 minutes here and just just just
[46:19] bring a practical side of this because
[46:21] this isn't all about a thorough
[46:23] high-altitude preaching you know we did
[46:26] a lot of that Sunday I'm opening up
[46:28] tonight with a lot of that but listen
[46:29] this stuff's got to get down where the
[46:32] rubber meets the road because if it's
[46:34] true we believe it's true and I think I
[46:35] proved it to you that you were called
[46:37] before the foundation of the world you
[46:39] came from God you're a part of God
[46:40] you're going back to God you have an
[46:42] Amen inside you then then that's not
[46:44] just here to give you you know dancing
[46:47] and and and and and and and and the
[46:50] liberties that that happiness would
[46:51] bring it means that there's gonna be a
[46:54] responsibility placed upon our lives it
[46:59] means that that that the enemy's going
[47:01] to fight you harder than most and it
[47:05] means that God is looking for something
[47:08] from you he didn't just remember as
[47:12] you've heard me say he didn't just say
[47:14] okay you're saved see in heaven you're
[47:18] here on a mission it's not an uncertain
[47:21] mission you
[47:22] mission here is no less is no more
[47:28] uncertain than Jesus was his mission was
[47:31] very certain and yours is no less
[47:33] certain than his was because he was
[47:37] fulfilling the headship part you
[47:40] understand of our Lord and His Christ
[47:44] that's you now you've got something to
[47:46] fulfill so when we when we look at the
[47:51] Bible the Bible isn't is an incredible
[47:54] book you know if we were not going there
[47:57] tonight but you get there you get the
[48:00] the Proverbs the Psalms and the Proverbs
[48:02] and we've taken such comfort from the
[48:04] Proverbs and from the Psalms and the
[48:06] Proverbs have such instruction
[48:09] day-to-day you know instructions and and
[48:12] I love the fact that you know the
[48:14] instructions are broad enough to where
[48:16] you know it's not just like you know
[48:19] what do you do if this exact situation
[48:21] happens no got God moving from Solomon
[48:24] you know gives sweeping principles so
[48:28] that you can go through life and
[48:30] whatever situation you find yourself in
[48:33] in the 21st century don't cop out and
[48:38] say well there's no scripture for this I
[48:40] promise you there's nothing you'll face
[48:42] that there's not a scripture for there's
[48:45] nothing you're going to face in this
[48:47] modern day before we get out of here
[48:49] that's not covered from the cradle to
[48:51] the grave this is your book of
[48:53] principles and guidance this is your
[48:55] lifeline this is your guidebook this is
[48:58] your reference manual this is your book
[49:01] of life it's your book of hell that your
[49:03] book of freedom your book of safety it's
[49:08] your book of power power over the devil
[49:11] power over the world power over sin and
[49:14] power over the flesh oh my I'm here to
[49:18] take something friends I don't I don't
[49:21] and it's not in that order with me the
[49:23] biggest enemy I got is not the world of
[49:25] not the devil and not sin in the world
[49:27] it's this old guy in the mirror
[49:30] that guy gives me more trouble
[49:32] hallelujah I thank God for the power of
[49:36] the of the Word of God that it can it
[49:38] can keep us clean and keep us free
[49:42] there's so many things that Solomon
[49:45] talks about in wisdom and and it and it
[49:48] goes to show you that the Bible is an
[49:50] application book see many people think
[49:55] that what's written in the Bible you
[50:00] know is is is in majority to do with
[50:03] getting people into heaven you know
[50:05] getting people right with God and saving
[50:08] their souls for all eternity of course
[50:11] that is that is that is at least
[50:13] probably half the Bible but you wouldn't
[50:15] call that the majority because equal to
[50:18] that equal to two getting people into
[50:22] heaven equal to getting people right
[50:24] with God equal to getting people
[50:26] born-again in their soul and it has to
[50:29] do not only with that but it has to do
[50:33] with with their course of life it is
[50:36] equally concerned with not just going to
[50:40] heaven but living on this earth that's
[50:46] an important point and that is a almost
[50:51] a a center part of the part of the hub
[50:54] that's a major spoke to this whole
[50:57] series that you understand that the
[51:00] Bible you know it's not just you know
[51:03] mostly to do with getting people
[51:05] born-again and getting them to heaven it
[51:07] certainly has its fair share of that it
[51:10] does have many things to do with that of
[51:13] course but but not above the other vital
[51:16] purpose of the Bible and that is
[51:19] concerned with living on earth and
[51:21] living well not just living but living
[51:28] well that's a challenge in this day
[51:30] because you got a world of such insanity
[51:34] you've got a world that's overrun that
[51:36] we have exceeded the days of Noah and
[51:39] the days of Noah God already destroyed
[51:42] the world that's how bad it was
[51:45] we're more than a half-century worse
[51:46] than that in the days of lot as soon as
[51:50] he left out of the city at rain fire and
[51:51] brimstone down and wiped everything out
[51:53] we're already more than a half century
[51:55] you are living in unparalleled
[51:58] unprecedented evil a time that Jesus
[52:02] identified uniquely as a time when Satan
[52:06] would be the god of the evil age that
[52:07] was never in any age until this age that
[52:11] he would be worshiped in church as
[52:13] Christ and and people wouldn't realize
[52:16] it but they're literally worshipping the
[52:18] devil this is the age and the only age
[52:21] when they for the second time would
[52:23] crucify the Word of God afresh and put
[52:29] him to an open shame so this is this is
[52:33] an epic moment in history and you know
[52:37] we we have our Bibles we have the word
[52:42] and we have not just a closed Bible
[52:44] because that's what it was that's what
[52:47] it testifies of itself that no man can
[52:51] understand it except that whom God opens
[52:54] it to and God promised that there would
[52:57] go down through many ages of the church
[52:59] and he would partially reveal it but he
[53:02] promised at the end time he would
[53:04] totally restore the full revelation you
[53:07] understand I'm here to tell you
[53:09] something friends that not only gives
[53:11] you life that not only gives you sanity
[53:13] that lets you live in robust sanity I'm
[53:18] here - I'm here to rejoice I live in
[53:20] robust sanity I don't just have a little
[53:23] bit of better knowledge than the world
[53:24] I'm sane I'm alive I have a great
[53:29] purpose I understand what's going on I
[53:31] understand what's called for from me I'm
[53:34] not in the dark I'm not groping the ages
[53:37] before were trying to find their way
[53:40] under partial light but God has brought
[53:43] not just the secret and the unlocking of
[53:46] the mysteries but he has brought us back
[53:49] the understanding how to live as
[53:51] kingdom saints we live as Kingdom Saints
[54:01] as Jesus said in his prayer when they
[54:05] asked him how do we pray one of his
[54:09] quotations in his prayer was on earth as
[54:13] it is in heaven so in other words here's
[54:17] my great prayer to God make this earth
[54:21] like the image of me there
[54:23] whatever I'm like there make me like
[54:27] that here help me to strive for that
[54:30] Lord what a target what is something to
[54:34] put out in front of you friends and so
[54:37] we realize that when we talk about
[54:39] Solomon's wisdom or the wisdom of Moses
[54:43] or the wisdom of Abraham or the wisdom
[54:44] of David or the wisdom of all the
[54:46] prophets you know that wisdom you know
[54:50] is the biblical term for this for this
[54:54] on earth as it is in heaven
[54:56] that's what wisdom is all about that's
[54:58] why when you read about wisdom in the
[55:01] Sun in in in proverbs it speaks of
[55:04] wisdom as a woman because at the end
[55:08] time that that's the whole the whole
[55:11] picture of Christ and his bride you
[55:14] understand that you're now the Living
[55:16] Word and so you are the dis the
[55:19] dispensers of wisdom to the world not
[55:23] because you're out here on the street
[55:24] corner screaming at everybody but your
[55:26] everyday walking around life when people
[55:28] see how you conduct yourself in this
[55:31] madness and you live in robust sanity
[55:34] then you're proving that there is a
[55:37] wisdom that exceeds the wisdom and
[55:39] knowledge of man because the wisdom of
[55:43] knowledge and man at his highest level
[55:45] can't fix the world he tries he can't
[55:50] get it fixed it's only getting worse
[55:53] everything he tries simply makes it
[55:55] worse because he's drawing his wisdom
[55:57] from the wrong source he thinks he's
[56:01] drawing wisdom in fact he's drawing
[56:03] knowledge from the 3 of 9
[56:05] which of good and evil see so we want to
[56:10] draw on real wisdom we we understand
[56:13] that it's the Petersons called wisdom
[56:17] the art of living skillfully in whatever
[56:20] actual condition we find ourselves see
[56:24] has nothing to do with information don't
[56:27] ever think the message is information is
[56:29] not information it's not just doctrine
[56:31] not theology brother Branham wasn't the
[56:36] problem when brother Branham preached
[56:37] indictment and he was showing them
[56:40] here's how you have crucified the Word
[56:43] of God you have committed spiritual
[56:45] adultery you have adult Erised the word
[56:49] and you've changed its meaning to meant
[56:52] to agree with man what man wanted it to
[56:54] say man wanted a a less rigorous version
[56:59] on his flesh because he he was living in
[57:02] an unconverted state and it's just too
[57:05] hard when you're unconverted a Christian
[57:09] life here in misery because you're
[57:12] always fighting against this insatiable
[57:13] urge for sin but you don't want to go to
[57:16] hell or you're afraid that you're gonna
[57:17] miss the rapture or all kinds of things
[57:19] like that that and that's and a lot of
[57:22] people I've said this for years so a lot
[57:24] of people get just enough of God in
[57:26] their life to make them miserable they
[57:30] don't go all the way but they get just
[57:32] enough knowledge to be afraid not to
[57:34] live something and they can go 10 years
[57:37] 20 30 40 years and never really actually
[57:40] have passed from death unto life and it
[57:42] finally they finally collapse because
[57:45] I'm here to tell you you might could
[57:46] have got by with that in the 90s in the
[57:48] early 2000s but here in the 21st century
[57:51] there's just no doing it the world is
[57:53] just too wicked you can't hold up under
[57:55] it you'll have a nervous breakdown
[57:57] trying to be a Christian without the
[57:59] Holy Ghost see so it's so brother
[58:04] Branham was trying to get them to
[58:05] understand you've rejected the the seed
[58:08] of life the Word of Life this is a
[58:10] bleeding word has life in it and and it
[58:13] has a life that can come into your life
[58:16] and show you
[58:17] how to live like this life like his life
[58:19] so that so that the kingdom is the
[58:22] kingdom of Christ and His Saints see so
[58:28] so we find out then that it has nothing
[58:31] really to do with knowledge as such a
[58:33] college therefore college degree it's
[58:36] certainly no certification of wisdom
[58:39] I've said to you in past services that
[58:43] the Antichrist is actively as we speak
[58:47] on a daily basis every 24 hours he has a
[58:51] game plan and he is literally molding
[58:55] people into the image of the tribulation
[58:58] they are headed into tribulation is a
[59:02] time of crazy madness and mankind is
[59:05] taking that on even ahead of the
[59:07] tribulation the tribulation is a time of
[59:10] unparalleled trouble and mankind has
[59:13] never been so troubled he he acts
[59:18] troubled he conducts himself troubled
[59:21] the the slightest little thing can take
[59:24] even even the most sane looking citizen
[59:28] one second I guarantee you brother Kevin
[59:30] could come up here tonight and just tell
[59:32] you the story after story about somebody
[59:34] who they got called who just had totally
[59:36] lost it and maybe had seen them sometime
[59:39] before that and they seemed like a
[59:40] perfectly normal person and and you
[59:42] don't realize that the world is walking
[59:44] the streets with ticking time bombs
[59:47] people just on the edge oh my goodness
[59:51] friends they don't realize they're going
[59:52] over that edge I want to be part of that
[59:54] group that's headed up in an order of
[59:56] ascending every day I'm here to tell you
[59:59] I know it's happening because every day
[1:00:01] the world gets worse I get more joy and
[1:00:04] more happiness and more determination
[1:00:06] the worst the world gets the more
[1:00:08] determined I become how can that be
[1:00:12] explained except by the Holy Ghost the
[1:00:16] same way the Antichrist is molding
[1:00:18] people into the image of the tribulation
[1:00:20] they are headed into the Holy Ghost came
[1:00:23] to mo
[1:00:24] you into the kingdom you are headed for
[1:00:26] you believe that he's here to mold you
[1:00:30] let me read you something brother
[1:00:32] Branham said brother Cao brother who's
[1:00:34] on the board
[1:00:35] give me revelation fifteen three sorry
[1:00:37] to jump you keV I should have gave you a
[1:00:39] warning revelation 15 three this one
[1:00:44] quick verse wait till we get it up here
[1:00:48] I can read along
[1:00:53] alright brother branham takes this up at
[1:00:57] the church age book and he says in they
[1:00:58] sang and they sing the song of Moses the
[1:01:03] servant of God and the song of the lamb
[1:01:06] saying great and marvellous are thy
[1:01:10] works Lord God Almighty just and true
[1:01:13] are thy ways thou king of saints brother
[1:01:21] Branham says do you see it now he's
[1:01:23] gonna ask you this is a question do you
[1:01:24] see it the lamb the high priest holding
[1:01:30] his blood as an atonement on the mercy
[1:01:32] seat for our sins and it's the Lord God
[1:01:37] Almighty see that is his present office
[1:01:43] that is what he's doing now pleading his
[1:01:47] blood for our sins aren't you glad
[1:01:49] aren't you glad for that but one day
[1:01:54] that lamb will become the Lion of the
[1:01:58] tribe of Judah he will come forth in
[1:02:02] power and glory to take his authority to
[1:02:05] reign his king now we're moving into the
[1:02:07] Millennium alright you got me
[1:02:09] right now he's interceding with his
[1:02:12] blood but one day he becomes lying the
[1:02:15] king of a millennial world alright so he
[1:02:19] says he will come forth in power
[1:02:21] alright to reign as king he is now watch
[1:02:25] this he is the coming king of this earth
[1:02:30] boy I doubt if the Kremlin or the
[1:02:33] Vatican or Washington likes that but he
[1:02:36] is
[1:02:37] the king of this earth he is the coming
[1:02:42] king of this earth of course that does
[1:02:45] not say he is not King now for he is our
[1:02:49] King see King of the Saints so you have
[1:02:56] a sovereign you have a king that you're
[1:02:59] you're you're a different citizen you
[1:03:01] have a different sovereign you
[1:03:02] understand we live here I'm not an
[1:03:04] American I'm a Christian I appreciate my
[1:03:08] land for what little bit of fragment is
[1:03:10] left of the old original idea which is
[1:03:14] fading fast but but but I appreciate
[1:03:18] that that I'm not going down with this
[1:03:24] world I am ascending up and when I come
[1:03:29] back we're gonna set up Christ and his
[1:03:32] kingdom of saints are gonna set up a
[1:03:34] Millennial Kingdom on this earth alright
[1:03:39] so he says right now is it is a
[1:03:45] spiritual Kingdom it is not of this
[1:03:47] world system even as we are not of this
[1:03:51] world
[1:03:52] that's why you can't be a Christian and
[1:03:54] act like the world that that point alone
[1:03:58] goes to show that people are living in
[1:04:01] nominal Christianity and they're not in
[1:04:03] they don't have any portion in this
[1:04:06] family of Saints because he's not even
[1:04:09] their King if he was their king they
[1:04:12] would be living according to his
[1:04:14] commandments so they they have him in
[1:04:19] name only I'm not being cruel I'm not
[1:04:22] calling names I'm not trying to put
[1:04:24] people down I'm trying to warn the world
[1:04:26] that that you think you're a Christian
[1:04:28] and you're fine you're not and you're
[1:04:30] not it's gonna be okay no it's not gonna
[1:04:34] be okay because the king is a real king
[1:04:38] and he has a real word and he has a real
[1:04:40] holy spirit and he wants to for real
[1:04:43] live inside
[1:04:44] you and then when he does that your life
[1:04:46] will look like his life
[1:04:48] it can no longer look like the world's
[1:04:50] life that is impossible so he says it is
[1:04:59] not of this world system even as we are
[1:05:02] not of this world that's the reason you
[1:05:04] ever wonder why here it is that's the
[1:05:06] reason we act different from the world
[1:05:09] our citizenship is in heaven I love this
[1:05:14] statement i'ma say it slow so you can
[1:05:16] absorb it we reflect the spirit of the
[1:05:21] world of our rebirth you understand we
[1:05:26] reflect why are we different
[1:05:28] what well what is this difference about
[1:05:31] us what is this difference that the
[1:05:33] world can see here's what it is we are
[1:05:36] reflect the spirit of the world of our
[1:05:38] rebirth I don't reflect this current
[1:05:41] world I'm not a reflector of that it has
[1:05:44] an image I don't want to reflect that I
[1:05:46] have no interest in reflecting that I'm
[1:05:48] here I realize that the Bible doesn't
[1:05:51] just isn't just trying to get me to
[1:05:53] heaven the Bible is teaching me how to
[1:05:54] live here because his kingdom is going
[1:05:58] to be here so I where aware you think
[1:06:01] about it friends you're already like an
[1:06:03] advance party establishing in the world
[1:06:06] what the world is going to look like
[1:06:08] when everybody is full of his life
[1:06:10] hallelujah
[1:06:14] so he says we reflect the spirit of the
[1:06:19] world of our rebirth where Jesus is the
[1:06:22] king not will be but is that is why our
[1:06:26] women do not dress in men's clothing or
[1:06:28] cut their hair or use all those
[1:06:30] cosmetics and other things that the
[1:06:32] world likes so much that is why our men
[1:06:36] don't drink and smoke and carry on and
[1:06:39] sin here's why see people think it's
[1:06:43] legalism it's not bad at all it has
[1:06:47] nothing to do with legal anything I'm
[1:06:50] above the law
[1:06:52] I'm above the law I'm in Christ
[1:06:57] there is nothing of the wall that is
[1:06:59] relevant to me I am in Christ perfected
[1:07:02] in Christ he already lived his life in
[1:07:06] representation mine I get credit for the
[1:07:08] life he already lived I cannot be
[1:07:10] indicted I cannot be arrested I cannot
[1:07:13] be convicted I can't even be try can't
[1:07:15] even be I can't even be accused in the
[1:07:18] month in the courtroom of God I have
[1:07:21] diplomatic immunity because I'm not from
[1:07:24] here understand Satan cannot bring on
[1:07:28] accusation against me when he tries he
[1:07:30] doesn't even it's not even accepted in
[1:07:32] God's Court
[1:07:33] there is now therefore no condemnation
[1:07:36] to them which are in Christ Jesus
[1:07:39] Paul's argument was look I'm not the one
[1:07:42] who died it was Christ see so it's not
[1:07:48] anything about a legalism it has nothing
[1:07:50] to do with that our Dominion is the
[1:07:54] dominion over sin and it is enforced
[1:07:58] through the power that is in the Spirit
[1:08:00] of Christ that indwells us that's why
[1:08:04] you've been if the world is listening
[1:08:06] tonight and you wonder why are all you
[1:08:08] people why do you women dress so
[1:08:10] old-fashioned why do your men dress
[1:08:12] old-fashioned why do you not do these
[1:08:14] things of the world why can't you be
[1:08:15] like all the nominal Christians because
[1:08:17] there's there's a Dominion that lives
[1:08:20] inside me and it's enforced through the
[1:08:23] power that is in the Spirit of Christ
[1:08:24] that indwells me every Kingdom on earth
[1:08:27] is going to be torn down but ours will
[1:08:32] remain now who's living in sanity and
[1:08:37] who's living in robust sanity I'm here
[1:08:41] to taste something friends you're part
[1:08:43] of a kingdom a kingdom of saints and
[1:08:46] it's in force it's it's a Dominion of
[1:08:49] the it's it's a power
[1:08:51] it's a Dominion that you have accepted
[1:08:54] into your life and it's it's taken you
[1:08:57] over see that that is what half this
[1:09:01] Bible is about half this Bible is about
[1:09:06] that
[1:09:08] about you living a successful Christian
[1:09:11] life under the Dominion of the power of
[1:09:14] God
[1:09:14] see so Jesus now you know he he makes
[1:09:21] that statement and and I and where we
[1:09:24] read give me our text again by the cab
[1:09:26] where we read out of Luke 17 6 through
[1:09:29] 10 and and I and I and I want to I want
[1:09:33] to take note of verse 7 Luke 17 7 but
[1:09:40] which of you having a servant plowing or
[1:09:43] feeding cattle will say unto Him by and
[1:09:46] by now catch it when he has come from
[1:09:48] the field now that's where we're that's
[1:09:52] going to become us right now we're
[1:09:55] laboring were the 11th hour workers or
[1:09:57] that were the last shift we're the lab
[1:10:00] there's not another shift coming the
[1:10:02] 11th hour worker was it that was in
[1:10:04] Jesus parable we all come into the field
[1:10:06] one of these days
[1:10:07] we're gonna come in from the field
[1:10:09] friends so now then he then look down at
[1:10:12] verse 10 for the Kevin so likewise when
[1:10:16] ye shall have done all those things
[1:10:18] which are commanded you so now I I'm I'm
[1:10:22] I'm I'm projecting to you tonight the
[1:10:27] the unique quality of this seventeenth
[1:10:31] chapter of Luke now you already know
[1:10:35] because we read on down on Sunday as it
[1:10:38] was in the days of lot as it was in the
[1:10:41] days of Noah as the Lightning cometh
[1:10:43] from the east and south into the West
[1:10:44] any of us here who are who have cut our
[1:10:47] teeth you know reading the message
[1:10:49] understand that Luke 17 is a monumental
[1:10:53] chapter for us because it in place after
[1:10:56] place after place it's speaking of the
[1:10:59] group of people who come to the end time
[1:11:02] guess what that's you that's me we're
[1:11:06] getting ready to come in from the field
[1:11:07] we're almost to the point where we've
[1:11:10] done all the things that have been
[1:11:12] commanded for the church to do oh what a
[1:11:15] thrilling thought that is friends
[1:11:17] our labor is almost over hallelujah
[1:11:22] so then then this ought to have a very
[1:11:28] direct impact we ought to look at these
[1:11:32] words in this description and in this
[1:11:35] description Jesus is talking about your
[1:11:38] service to the king now we've been
[1:11:41] sitting here for 3540 minutes rejoicing
[1:11:44] that weird part of the kingdom and that
[1:11:46] we have a king and we're part of his
[1:11:49] genes a man and we have a dominion over
[1:11:51] sin a man but remember what he's saying
[1:11:55] he shouldn't need these are kingdom
[1:11:57] principles that says chapters 17 16 back
[1:12:02] through there that that's why the the
[1:12:04] Pharisees Jesus is giving principle
[1:12:06] after principle saying look the kingdom
[1:12:08] of heaven now the kingdom of Earth is
[1:12:10] this this this but the kingdom of heaven
[1:12:13] is likened to the kingdom of heaven is
[1:12:15] like unto so the world has its normal
[1:12:19] sea and God calls it foolishness but
[1:12:23] Jesus said but now the kingdom of heaven
[1:12:26] is an altogether different thing and
[1:12:28] they're running simultaneously and we
[1:12:32] are reflecting the spirit of the land of
[1:12:36] our rebirth where Jesus is the king a
[1:12:38] man that's what makes us different and
[1:12:41] so when we look at these principles
[1:12:44] Jesus is telling us how to act telling
[1:12:46] us how to think he's saying look put
[1:12:49] yourself you realize that you're the
[1:12:50] servant you're the servant and you're
[1:12:56] you're not here to to say to God I'm
[1:13:01] hungry you know feed me what I want but
[1:13:06] that's what people say give me a word
[1:13:08] that I can that'll fit me instead of me
[1:13:12] fitting the word give me a word that's
[1:13:14] comfortable and and and and sing me a
[1:13:18] beautiful song that's what not sinners
[1:13:19] in the Old Testament wanted they wanted
[1:13:21] comfortable words they didn't like those
[1:13:24] prophets those prophets were they said
[1:13:26] all they're just angry old men are
[1:13:28] always bawling us out and
[1:13:30] and you know we want to hear a pleasant
[1:13:32] song and you know and we want
[1:13:35] comfortable words and the profit would
[1:13:37] come back time after time with a message
[1:13:39] of doom Elijah comes stomping out of the
[1:13:42] wilderness with one single message
[1:13:44] you're all gonna die you're all a bunch
[1:13:47] of filthy sinners and God's killing
[1:13:49] everybody
[1:13:49] and I'm the only one even left he wasn't
[1:13:52] mistaken thank God the Lord still had a
[1:13:56] representation in the earth but it
[1:14:00] wasn't gonna end well for those prophets
[1:14:02] of bale 450 of them wasn't going to end
[1:14:05] well for forum 400 of them I think and
[1:14:07] so we find that that he's saying you
[1:14:12] know you don't say to the king fit the
[1:14:15] word to me you know the Kings not saying
[1:14:19] to you hey you know sit down take it
[1:14:21] easy half a meal the King said Jesus
[1:14:23] said what a king's say that to his
[1:14:25] servant he said I don't think so said
[1:14:27] the king would say listen you're my
[1:14:29] servant gird yourself and get yourself
[1:14:31] ready to serve me I know you've been out
[1:14:33] there in the field in the hot Sun all
[1:14:34] day that's beside the point now you're
[1:14:36] in here to serve me at my table and I'm
[1:14:39] not even going to thank you for it
[1:14:40] because and not only that as if as if to
[1:14:44] add insult to injury he's going to say
[1:14:47] in fact when you when you show me your
[1:14:50] successful work in the field and you
[1:14:52] shall you successfully serve me my meal
[1:14:55] then you're gonna go and you're gonna
[1:14:57] write sentences I am an unprofitable
[1:14:59] servant 500 times on the chalkboard oh I
[1:15:06] had to do that one time I had to write
[1:15:07] sentences I forget what I'd done in
[1:15:09] class but you know I was stubborn and so
[1:15:11] I didn't do and so a hundred became two
[1:15:13] and I dug in more and two became four
[1:15:16] and I dug in more and four became eight
[1:15:18] we're talking to hundreds and by the
[1:15:21] time it was over I think I would the
[1:15:22] teacher of something like fourteen or
[1:15:24] fifteen hundred sentences and my I think
[1:15:27] my mom had to get involved and say that
[1:15:28] if we're not doing that will will making
[1:15:31] you you reduce it to half an and so the
[1:15:33] teacher compromised and I setup for two
[1:15:35] or three nights writing sentence oh mama
[1:15:38] day something friends that you don't
[1:15:39] want to resist Authority that's over
[1:15:41] yeah
[1:15:42] amen so he's saying your your your to
[1:15:47] here's your here's to be as a kingdom
[1:15:50] child this should be your attitude
[1:15:53] I'm just an unprofitable servant now
[1:15:55] that sounds that I mean the human you
[1:15:59] know the the agnostic are the atheist
[1:16:01] would go Wow
[1:16:03] why do you serve a god like that doesn't
[1:16:06] even appreciate you for the work you
[1:16:08] you've done listen friends you know what
[1:16:11] our answer to that can only be to say
[1:16:14] bud if I worked every day for a thousand
[1:16:18] years by the sweat of my brow I could
[1:16:21] never repay him for the debt of love I
[1:16:24] owe because when I've worked those
[1:16:26] thousand years then I've got all
[1:16:27] eternity ahead of me my vacation my
[1:16:30] retirement is out of this world brother
[1:16:31] Joe
[1:16:32] oh my and so you know we we think about
[1:16:37] these words that he says here your your
[1:16:39] to say III was verse 10 was when you
[1:16:45] shall have done all those things which
[1:16:47] are command you say now this is us this
[1:16:48] is the end time say we are unprofitable
[1:16:52] servants we have done that which was our
[1:16:54] duty to do and I began to look at that
[1:16:59] and I I found some wonderful commentary
[1:17:03] how that this word unprofitable that it
[1:17:10] that you know it has a I want to try to
[1:17:13] show you a different angle tonight that
[1:17:15] this word unprofitable has a rude word
[1:17:19] synonymous to this actual root word and
[1:17:22] it and it's the the synonym quino's and
[1:17:26] we and what it literally means is is
[1:17:29] empty it means empty now that's what a
[1:17:35] eunuch is a eunuch is a he's a
[1:17:38] Chamberlain to the to the court to the
[1:17:40] King's wife he doesn't at all try
[1:17:43] anything himself he's sterile first of
[1:17:46] all he has there's no passing of his
[1:17:49] seed to the King's wife he he only
[1:17:51] guards her provides her needs whatever
[1:17:53] she needs
[1:17:54] and the king has no fear to leave her in
[1:17:56] the presence of this eunuch or this
[1:17:58] Chamberlain and this is this is what you
[1:18:02] are as a servant of God you're empty
[1:18:05] you understand and and the commentator
[1:18:09] the commentator says you know
[1:18:12] unprofitable and this is this is
[1:18:14] actually why he started looking at the
[1:18:16] root meanings because he kept reading
[1:18:19] this word unprofitable unprofitable he
[1:18:22] says this being the inescapable truth I
[1:18:25] decided to turn a lemon into lemonade
[1:18:29] beautiful and he says it means empty as
[1:18:35] in the song that we sing when we we we
[1:18:40] have altar calls and we sing the song I
[1:18:43] grew up as a child hearing this played
[1:18:45] and sung at altar calls nothing in my
[1:18:48] arms I bring simply to thy cross I cling
[1:18:54] he goes on he says since it was certain
[1:18:58] and proven in the Bible that I had in my
[1:19:02] fallen condition no value
[1:19:05] to such a holy and high being I died to
[1:19:09] self completely that's the well what a
[1:19:13] way to look at being unprofitable that
[1:19:15] he's literally turning it around he's
[1:19:17] saying this isn't a disparaging thing
[1:19:19] this isn't a hard-nosed boss this is God
[1:19:22] saying no your your there's nothing of
[1:19:26] you profitable to me your only profit is
[1:19:29] if I can work through you your your to
[1:19:32] be empty you understand he says since it
[1:19:36] was certain that in this fallen
[1:19:38] condition I had no value to such a holy
[1:19:40] and high being I died to self completely
[1:19:44] as a pure servant I I took Paul's
[1:19:48] counsel and I died daily and thus
[1:19:51] managed to stay out of his way never
[1:19:54] trying to inject my ideas or actions
[1:19:57] however well-intentioned I presented
[1:20:00] myself each new day as an empty and
[1:20:03] clean vessel for him to work through
[1:20:07] by filling this unprofitable servant
[1:20:10] with all of himself God successfully did
[1:20:15] it all and deserved all the glory he
[1:20:18] says this is noteworthy by the Lord and
[1:20:21] Luke's Gospel started shouting I thought
[1:20:26] what a way to look at Luke 1710 the Lord
[1:20:31] is not being snarky and cruel and
[1:20:33] cutting he's simply trying to get you to
[1:20:35] understand what it means to be a servant
[1:20:37] you have no intrinsic value to him your
[1:20:40] best effort your best holiness is
[1:20:43] filthiness to him that's how high he is
[1:20:46] your best holiness friends that's why
[1:20:49] it's not about legalism God can't use
[1:20:51] your good works God God wants you to
[1:20:54] bring him your worst so that he can
[1:20:57] empty you out and fill you with all of
[1:20:59] himself and then you're truly a servant
[1:21:03] to God you're on you are unprofitable
[1:21:08] he's the only profitable life and so by
[1:21:12] dying daily I love how he ended it by
[1:21:15] filling this unprofitable servant with
[1:21:18] all of himself God successfully did it
[1:21:22] all and deserved all the glory here's a
[1:21:28] man who understood what it meant to die
[1:21:30] daily to see that that you with all of
[1:21:36] your wisdom and knowledge and creativity
[1:21:38] and zeal and spunk and fervor and all of
[1:21:41] these things you do nothing but get in
[1:21:44] God's way you just get in his way and
[1:21:48] what he needs you to do is just die
[1:21:51] completely realize that to say I'm empty
[1:21:55] nothing in my arms I bring I have no
[1:21:57] value to you Lord except you working
[1:22:00] through me I am willing to be a kingdom
[1:22:05] vessel how many are willing to be that a
[1:22:10] kingdom vessel you know when I must and
[1:22:16] when I look at this world come brother
[1:22:17] John a man will try to
[1:22:20] a song here before we go to prayer you
[1:22:25] know when I was I think I was telling
[1:22:29] you Sunday that that in school I ran
[1:22:32] track I was on the track team I was a
[1:22:33] distance runner and I did some some long
[1:22:37] jumping and some distance running and I
[1:22:40] ran relay races and I
[1:22:41] I ran distance races and I I remember
[1:22:48] whenever I would be running a race and I
[1:22:53] would have a certain pace because you've
[1:22:55] got to pace yourself in a distance run
[1:22:57] to make sure you can finish and you know
[1:23:00] I I had this thing that even my coach he
[1:23:03] didn't like it so good but it was it was
[1:23:05] how it worked for me and I and I would
[1:23:08] always when I would run these races I
[1:23:10] would just run at a speed that would
[1:23:13] keep me you know about mid-pack and it
[1:23:16] wasn't until I made that final turn on
[1:23:19] the track and weigh probably several
[1:23:23] football fields in length I could see
[1:23:25] the finish line and as soon as I come
[1:23:27] around that last cross-country corner
[1:23:30] and come back around and I would see
[1:23:33] that finish line I would turn on the
[1:23:35] Jets something about seeing the finish
[1:23:38] line boosted me to pour it on I would
[1:23:43] and and after you're running a long
[1:23:45] distance you know we were running three
[1:23:46] miles and and by the time here you're
[1:23:48] gonna sprint that last 200 meters maybe
[1:23:51] 300 meters you almost feel like you're
[1:23:54] running on air yeah that's hard to
[1:23:55] explain the I don't know if it's blood
[1:23:57] to your head or whatever you're
[1:23:58] overheated or whatever it is but it
[1:24:00] feels like you're in a dream and when
[1:24:02] you're sprinting at the end of a long
[1:24:05] run and I and I loved it I loved that
[1:24:08] euphoric feeling of seeing and I was
[1:24:10] always I was either always first or
[1:24:12] second across that line and the coach
[1:24:14] would always say where was some of that
[1:24:16] energy during the Midway and I said I
[1:24:18] was saving it for the Hinton
[1:24:20] he never liked it he never got used to
[1:24:23] it but I never changed it because I will
[1:24:25] taste some friends I see the finish line
[1:24:27] I can see it's a buzz Jason the
[1:24:29] craziness of the world I see a finish
[1:24:31] line you see man
[1:24:32] this I see I'm almost home hallelujah
[1:24:35] and it makes me want to run it makes me
[1:24:37] want to serve it makes me want to be all
[1:24:40] that God has seen of me in his vision of
[1:24:43] his mind that's my great desire friends
[1:24:46] amen I hope it's yours tonight that's
[1:24:49] enough for tonight we'll pick it up
