anyway i am so glad for that so god bless you let's stand back to our feet we're going to just make a few announcements and i've got a couple prayer requests that i want to pray over there but i wanted just to also let you know brother jason is going to be bringing brother jason to mars is going to be bringing the morning message for us and we had a good time here i was able to i got to teach the sunday school we kind of did a roll swap today and i wanted to just let you know what that's about amen um so um from last year as you all remember i had situation where i had some blockages in my heart arteries and they put a stent in been doing great and so tomorrow in the early afternoon they're going to do a follow-up heart cath to make sure everything is working fine i had a very slight symptom that was similar to last year a year ago it was very mild it wasn't anything compared to a year ago but the doctor felt that in an abundance of caution hey you know all my tests always come back normal when they test my heart every test i ever take my heart comes back strong they tell me you have heart of an athlete oh your ejection fraction so strong echo is great everything is great uh and none of it detected um that blockage but i had a certain symptom that kind of was a an identifier well so i was exercising the other day isn't that great i was exercising and i just felt it a little bit and so i went to see the cardiologist and i said hey it's not much and it wasn't very much at all and it went away quickly but it was there he said well was it there and i said yeah he said well in your case he said look at i mean they they just put me on the machine and said look at this this all looks great he said but we know how your body works that that's the one little signal you get he said so better safe than sorry i said yes sir better safe than sorry i don't want to do it so bad i can't stand it i can't hate the rigamaro of it but i i told um made sister debbie a promise i would do whatever it was to keep myself around hey man to take care of her amen i have too many too far too much responsibility to take a chance i have my wife and my children my grandchildren my mother uh you this assembly the ministry of the gospel around the world so amen i'm gonna gonna go against my will tomorrow and do that if you just be praying for me please that i expected and as he expects it also he said i expect to find nothing amiss and uh that's what we expect so it's just kind of a precaution but he did tell me uh you need to see solid uh strenuous exercise he didn't say anything about preaching but i know how i preached and i thought oh man i'm gonna have to swap out for sunday so we're having brother demars take it today and i know you'll enjoy it we always enjoy brother jason and so we're going to move to that i want to take two quick prayer requests sister ruth sent me can you please um one of one of the employees and good friend's father passed away this morning could you please pray for her and her family what's her name sister amanda all right and then brother bruce also said brother jason i have a request that you pray for our son adam and his girlfriend carly who have a severe case of covet thank you and god bless you brother bruce and so also different ones are out away today traveling and i think brother steve is on the road driving sister emily some are going to catch a flight so let's be praying for all of them i have some family members traveling want safe journeys for all of them amen praise the lord so you love the lord i just wanted to come out and tell you all that so you can see i'm fine amen and this morning i actually caught myself trying to preach during my sunday school and i kept trying to pull it back so today is my sweetheart day sister debbie and i our 40th wedding anniversary amen so i appreciate that sister debbie reminded me of that little little joke it's actually not a joke it's actually a true story you know about the guy who was bragging about 50 years at his 50th wedding anniversary 50 years with the same woman after he said it you know seven or eight times to everybody that wanted to hear it his wife finally said dear i've been with you 50 years i will assure you i'm not the same woman so sister debbie reminded me she said taking care of you for 40 years just remember i'm not the same woman i said well you're my woman anyway so the only one i want amen the perfect one for me amen praise the lord amen so god bless you we're going to ask brother anthony to come and lead us in one more song and then we'll turn it to brother jesus [Music] i feel [Music] and i know his fears moving me to give my arm he speaks to me [Music] and i agree lord please come take control i feel at night i laid in bed and i began to cry [Music] and my mind just fails to know exactly why [Music] me with [Music] cause i feel [Applause] [Music] i look home and i know his fears moving me to give he speaks to me and i agree [Music] lord please come take control i feel [Music] and with each line and praise [Music] he was drawing me together higher praise [Music] there's a deed called to the deep like a great pulling me i know for sure [Music] i [Applause] and i know his fears moving me to get my [Music] amen lord please come and take control i feel [Music] [Applause] amen amen that's what we're hearing [Music] and speak to his people that's our desire there were a couple of prayer requests made known before we want to remember those also we want to keep remembering brother donald jackson in prayer if you hadn't heard he had fell out of the tree doing some trimming last wednesday night quite a number of injuries there's a lot the lord is working he was able to stand up and put weight on his both legs yesterday but there's a lot of healing and recovery i think some surgeries as well that with him that god is able to touch and heal him and deliver him from this also praise report from brother brad writing in that he's doing much better after having some complications from a root canal so we thank the lord for that also want to remember brother matt also sister amariah both not feeling well zoe is in recovery ethan's here so he's must be doing pretty good praise the lord for that and um let's go before the lord in prayer amen father we we come to you lord and we know that you're a ever-present help in time of trouble lord and we're living in such a deceiving hour and we know that satan wants us to get our eyes off of you and on to ourselves and our circumstances lord and i just pray for each of these requests that what's behind that lord that each each one would have their eyes of faith fixed upon you lord even if it's just a small amount of faith just as a purity of a mustard seed faith lord yet you can work in that and through that father and even even when a person like myself in my own testimony of healing maybe you can't can't even have faith for yourself but we can have faith for those who are weak and hurting lord bring us up into that channel of faith in this hour lord we want to lift up brother donald lord oh our heart just moved so much when we heard what happened lord and we know we know that you're a healer so you've already started that process lord would you continue to heal his body and make him completely well father lord we want to lift up brother bruce's son adam and his girlfriend carly both suffering from a bad case of covid lord just touch them lord and deliver them and heal them lord we thank you for touching brother brad we're so grateful for that lord it's can be such a serious thing with infections and in bones and things lord but you you touched him and and he's on the mend we thank you lord and want to lift up brother matt amariah zoe lord would you just give them a touch and heal them and raise them up lord also want to lord live before you the curtises one driving one flying in lord just may your hand of protection be upon them and bring them here safely lord for sister ruth's co-worker lord would you move in that situation lord we commit it to you lord and we want to we just want to look to you now lord we want we want your presence to come and break open your word to your people lord we wan help me to step out of the way help each one of us lord to lay aside the the thoughts that are might be nagging us in the cares of this world lord to focus just a few minutes on the word we ask these things in jesus name amen god bless you i'm going to speak on the subject of the marriage of the lamb also for those who are volunteering to help with the youth meeting weekend we're going to have a meeting right after service so stay around it'll be brief won't keep you long so all right i had studied this topic before the marriage of the lamb and had some notes but yesterday in the the men's bible study we spoke about the seventh seal and and we're going through some different things and and uh i think it was brother rodney that brought up the the type of the marriage and so and how critical that is i'm looking for the uh the clicker for the i think it's up there they're running it up so we want to go to the first slide there and read the scripture while you're standing we don't want to keep you standing all after all through the afternoon but uh second corinthians 11 2. for i am jealous over you with godly jealousy for i have espoused you to one husband that i may present you as a chaste virgin to christ revelation 9 19 7 let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the lamb is come and his wife hath made herself ready amen may the lord have the blessing to the reading of his word he can be seated so looking at the seventh seal we were discussing that some yesterday and how that you know many times people they want they want to look at the seventh seal and they begin to study it and they look at what brother branham said in the sermon the seventh seal by itself and they come and say it's not it's not revealed we it's a secret we can't know anything about it okay that's what that's an accurate depiction of what he says in the seventh seal but again we don't stop there the message doesn't end there he continues to pre in case he didn't know that after the seals he continues to preach after that he speaks about that topic he there's there's some quotes we're going to look at but when you look and see in the seventh seal he also gives clues he'll he'll be speaking a certain way a certain way a certain way and then he says but which reminds me of revelation 10 7 but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel the mystery of god should be finished so here's here's ten things when i was studying the seventh seal that i grabbed a hold of three there's a threefold mystery one of the folds is the seven thunders another fold is connected to the coming of the son of man a mystery known only to god then the seven thunders reveals the coming of the son of man six seals have been opened we see it seventh will not be broke to the public until the hour arrives the seventh he says the seventh seal is not completely unfolded all right he says it's it's just unfolded to the seven thunders and again he repeats the seventh seal is not known to the public in matthew 24 he says when he goes through that he left out the seventh seal meaning he said it was a mystery matthew 24 36 and 37 speaks of no man knows the day or the hour but it but but as it was in the days of noah so shall it be at the coming of the son of man so that's what he's saying the seventh seal is the coming of the son of man then as he finishes all this he says it won't be known and it's not going to be known but it will be revealed in the days of the voice of the seventh angel all right so you know brother branham speaks about this the sec first and second polls he thoroughly explained over and over again right and he wasn't supposed to do that what did it do brother branham said it produced impersonators but to this point in time in his life the lord had taught him and trained him don't do it again don't do it a third time don't thoroughly explain every detail the third time he very carefully spoke about the seventh seal and the third pole and he emphasized at the end it's not to be known to the public he says he says just live don't try to interpret it just live a godly christian life don't be fanatical i love that it's almost like a sleight of hand a little bit that brother brother branham is doing he's saying don't interpret it just live a godly life because living a godly life is the interpretation of it because then you fast forward and we understand okay it's it's it's not going to be known to the public this is it's a total secret okay are we supposed to stay there without understanding are we supposed to just okay it's a total secret mine stop done it'll be known sometime in the future laodicean church age i think i'm not sure if this is working brothers i'm not sure if this is the right one am i is this hiding from me up here i know there's a second one uh maybe this one will work we'll give it a shot that one don't work and that one don't work brother george could you help me you fixed it before go on to the next screen yeah chapter 9 in the church ages book now this messenger of malachi 4 and revelation 10 7 is going to do two things one according to malachi 4 he will turn the hearts of the children to the fathers 2 he will reveal the mysteries of the seven thunders in revelation 10 which are the revelations contained in the seven seals it will be these divinely revealed mystery truths that literally turn the hearts of the children to the pentecostal fathers exactly so all right let's go back don't don't go to the next screen yet so this is this is key in understanding this are the seven thunders what they spoke are they is it revealed according to this it is right so we're not waiting for a future revealing of the seven thunders right before the literal body change takes place some people will interpret it that way the right before the literal body change seven thunders will under their voices to bring rapturing faith brother branham's message was to bring rapturing faith the seven thunders was to bring rapturing faith they're one in the same right it's the seventh what the seven thunders utter actually restores us back to the original faith so it's not a new revelation it's not something outside of scripture but it's what is hidden in the bible the teachings of the apostles and the prophets there that were sealed to our understanding throughout the church ages then brother branham says when the seals open it becomes a new book not that it literally becomes a new book but that the understanding of what's already in the book now is made known made plain made clear amen and so we can't we can't say the seventh seal is not revealed it's not revealed to the public absolutely it's a spiritual revelation for the bride only we can as preachers we can stand and we can try to [Music] uh unfold it to you explain it to you but at the end of the day it has to be a revelation from the holy spirit it's you can acquire knowledge about this topic human knowledge and it can be the worst thing that could happen to you because it creates pride and at the same time if it's spiritual revelation that's bringing knowledge because we're supposed to grow in the grace and the knowledge of the lord jesus so our growth in grace and our growth as christians is connected to knowledge but it's not human knowledge it's spiritual revelation that's what the that's what the bible is that's what paul is continually pointing to continually talking about he prays for the church in ephesus and he says i'm praying that you would receive a spirit of wisdom and revelation in what in the knowledge of him okay don't get it out of order people can get it out of order and so emphasize on the knowledge aspect they divorce themselves from it has to be a spiritual revelation from god otherwise it's no knowledge to speak of in the first place it's not knowledge that's going to change your life but there is hidden mystery knowledge that we're supposed to have that will change our lives but it has to come by something that god unfolds to you as an individual because it's not to be known to the public but it's to be known and revealed to the bride so the seven thunders it's already revealed we're not waiting for more um teachings to be made known everything that the bride has need of has been revealed in brother branham's message but everything that's revealed it revealed in that message is not yet an understanding to us right and so that's why we're still here is god is unfolding himself through that message to us as individual members of the body bride of christ that's god's purpose he wants you to have a revel i have an understanding in in the sermon the paradox if you look at the beginning he says it's coming to an ephesians again and we're going to understand it the bride is going to understand it so please don't consider knowledge and understanding as a swear word but understand it in its right balance it has to be holy spirit inspired and revealed to your heart we can study we can get it all figured out that's that's meaningless and useless it has to come by a revelation of the holy ghost to you as an individual all right so it's a secret won't be known to the public but but we see this this and then we see the next if we go to the next screen brothers in christ is the mystery of god revealed god's great mystery of how it's a secret he kept it a secret nobody knowed nothing about it even the angels didn't understand it see he didn't reveal it that's the reason under our seventh mystery when the seventh seal was open there was silence jesus when he was on earth they wanted to know when he would come he said it's not even the son himself don't know when it's going to happen see god has this all to himself it's a secret and that's the reason there was silence in heaven for a space of a half hour and seven thunders utter their voices and john was even forbidden to write i think we need to go on to the next one john was even forbidden to write it see the coming of the lord that's the one thing he hasn't revealed yet of how he will come and when he will come it's a good thing that he doesn't no okay so this is interesting what he's saying the quote doesn't end there though let's go to the next screen look his next verse it's sim it's so similar to the seventh seal it's not known it's not revealed yet it's a good thing he doesn't he has showed it he should order revealed it in every type that's in the bible therefore the entire bible is the revelation of god's mystery in christ the entire bible is an expression of one goal that god had one purpose he wanted to achieve in the entire bible next screen and all the acts of the believers in the bible has been in type and expressing what god's great goal is and now in this last day he has revealed it and showed it okay it's a good thing he hasn't revealed it next thing he says it's in every type in the bible and god's great goal and now in the last day he reveals it and shows it and god's help will see it right here this morning what the lord has had in his mind all along and it has expressed it therefore you can see the great meaning of what it's been to know this and then to try to bring it to the people see and then you don't i haven't went into details to try to explain it as god has revealed it to me again similar language to the seventh seal it's we don't know it it's a mystery good thing he doesn't reveal it and we're gonna speak about it and show you exactly what it is today why is he doing that because he was warned he was warned let it be a spiritual revelation to the people don't explain every detail let it be that revelation to the people now i want you to want to show you in the next quote when we're talking about the coming or the revealing of the son of man he says jesus said when the son of man is revealed from heaven let me close by saying this the son of man is now being revealed from heaven will it come after a while brother branham it is now and i hope i won't have to make this purse so personal of this own meeting but that your spirit within you that's given you by god can read what i'm talking about the some son of man has already come from glory and is revealing himself for the past few years to his church in mercy showing them his great presence doing the same things that he did when he was here on earth revealing himself like he did to abraham before the destruction he has come now in mercy revealing himself to the church it's being laughed at and scoffed at so understand the big picture don't shut your brain off if you go study the seven do study the seventh seal but don't shut your brain off your mind off your your spiritual understanding from the rest of what the message says because brother branham is speaking in careful terms to not go into every detail but for for those of us who've been following the message it should be quite obvious what he's talking about the seven thunders reveals the coming of the son of man hmm well what does that mean what are this what is what what can we break down the seventh seal real easy it's the message it's the message and and we're going to talk about more about that um more about the second aspect of that because it has to not just be a message that's out there in space but it has to be christ becoming one with his bride and and she being him amen so understand of course this is this quote is from 1958 i don't want to muddle things up understanding 1963 the mighty angel came down in a unique way to open up those seals to us to bring us the revelation of the word so don't don't get confused but of course throughout brother branham's ministry the son of man was there behind that revealing himself through that but something distinct and important happened in 1963 that was different from what happened before that that's another topic altogether but let's look at that statement brother branham makes back there let's talk about that all the acts of the believers in the bible has been in type and expressing what god's great goal is he says and now in this last day he has revealed it and shows it so the seventh seal is shown by every type throughout the bible so fast forward then christ is the mystery of god revealed what verse is that from the mystery of god revelation 10 7 so christ is the mystery of god revealed but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of god should be finished as it was revealed to his servants the prophets so what what what is the threefold mystery god revealed in fullness in christ god god revealed in fullness in his bride to bring the preeminence and the restoration back to the kingdom those three things it's a threefold purpose so well that's what's god that's god's great goal that's what's unfolded by the seventh seal it's it's so complicated you'll never understand it without me explaining it to you no no i don't believe god made it that way i don't believe god purposed it that way amen these things are clear brother jason has pretty much been preaching to us about this for the last since i've been here brother jason from different every different angle it's if we're not if we're not picking he's preaching to us the seventh seal the third pole the opening of the word what the message is we don't want it to go over go over our heads or not or miss the importance of what he's talking about this is key so one way that god reveals himself in type through the bible is through marriage right actually that's one of his most primary ways you know that's part of the great importance of understanding the revelation of serpent seed is because it's always a false life injecting itself into the place that god is working in to bring an adultery amongst the people and so that's that's the continual process in in eve through eve through israel through the church and he's still trying to do it today trying to inject a false seed and so when we understand serpent seed we can we can grasp this because god is trying to be married to his people and have full and complete preeminence in them so that when you see them you're seeing him right he made man adam and eve he made man and woman to be the image and likeness of god the two of them together in unity express the invisible god not not each of them separate but the two of them together in god's economy so christ and his bride is a perfect expression of who god who the invisible god is and so in in the bible we see a lot of things written about marriage and i don't believe it's our british marriage customs that have passed over to america that is the type of christ and his bride but it's eastern traditions of marriage and customs that we find in the bible and it's made clear from genesis to revelation these things are made plain before us it's incredible so i want to start with with the next quote that i have up there brother travis from proving his word he says to join the church to the head unite the marriage of the bride the bridegroom call will come right through this when the son of man will come down and come in human flesh to unite the two together the church has to be the word he is the word and the two unites together and to do that it will take the manifestation of the revealing of the son of man next one not a clergyman i don't i don't know i do you see what i mean see it's the son of man jesus christ will come down in human flesh among us and will make his word so real that it will unite the church and him as one the bride and then she'll go home to the wedding supper amen she's already united see we go to the wedding supper not to the marriage so what does he tell what is he saying there he's he's telling us in very simple terms the son of man has come down into a body of people a many member bride in this hour in order to join the two together in marriage christ and the bride are married the marriage of the lamb has come his wife hath made herself ready we're married listen to invisible union go go and listen to that find out if we're married or not all right so again marriage customs are different in every culture but if we're gonna see a type in the marriage custom we're gonna have to see a type in the bible so first scripture we had up and i think it's the next one yeah second corinthians 11 2 for i am jealous over you with godly jealousy for i've espoused you to one husband that i may present you as a chaste virgin to christ so paul is saying i've i've you're engaged i've been a part of the i've been the one to communicate that there's an engagement going here there's a betrothal that's taken place between the church and christ he didn't say there's a wedding that took place he said there's a betrothal there's an engagement that's taken place and so let's go to the next screen and i have a number of points come up just go one by one as i cover them by the travis so here's the process and we'll see this in the scripture first thing is negotiation between families where the father of the groom has to pay a price to the father of the bride next comes the betrothal or the jerusalem ceremony at this point stage in time they're legally married and a divorce would need to be obtained to split them up this is legally binding marriage at this point and in ancient times it actually was the most important portion of the marriage process three then a year there's they would have a year waiting period that would take place where they could not live together as husband and wife next came taking possession of your bride which has been purchased this was done at the consummation of a ceremony where the husband took his wife into a private room and they were joined together in one flesh then after that's that a celebration took place if the family was wealthy it was a week-long celebration all right so that's let's look at this spelled out in scripture matthew 1 18-20 now the birth of jesus christ was on this wise when as his mother mary was espoused or betrothed to joseph before they came together she was found with child of the holy ghost then joseph her husband being a just man and not willing to make her a public example was minded to put her away privily you see there he had to actually write a certificate of divorce even though they hadn't been joined together she was found with child of the holy ghost he would he was going to think he was thinking there i'm going to divorce her but while he thought on these things behold the angel of the lord appeared unto him in dreams saying joseph thou son of david fear not to take unto thee mary thy wife for that which is conceived in her is of the holy ghost so there we see the whole process he was betrothed to her right there's a he was during the waiting period that the holy spirit over overshadowed mary and he says i'm going to divorce her so he they're legally bound at that point in time to to one another all right but then the last process the the lord appears in a dream and says take mary as your wife take her to yourself that's the that's the last process is the claiming of the bride all right so first there's that patrol that that marriage proposal if it's accepted by the bride's family then they immediately set the dates for the there's a ceremony so after the betrothal takes place they actually have a ceremony and what they what they actually do is the engaged couple drinks wine from the same cup and an engagement blessing is pronounced over them after they've taken that oath to seal their betrothal matthew 26 27 says and he took the cup and gave thanks and gave it to them them saying drink he all of it so this is the this is an engagement ceremony taking place there at the last supper together they drink out of that cup um once the ceremony takes place they drink the cup together the blessing is said now you got to pay now the father the father of the bride has to pay whatever the agreement was made there the contract is made the price has to be paid first corinthians 6 20 says for you are bought with a price there therefore glorify god in your body and in your spirit which are gods uh did we miss first corinthians i might have missed it in my thing that's all right first peter 1 18 and 19 for as much as you know that you are not redeemed with corruptable things as silver and gold from your vain conversation received by tradition from your fathers but with the precious blood of christ as of a lamb without blemish without spot when he wanted to pay a price for his bride what did he do he shed his own blood that was the purchase price he shed his own blood he gave his own life to make the purchase of his own bride so just you know in ancient times there was two parts always of a financial transaction you paid then you take possession first ephesians 1 14 says which is the earnest the down payment of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession unto the praise of his glory so he paid the price at calvary right that's the start that's that's that's how the the marriage process that's how the joining begins but he has he didn't take possession yet he's gonna in the future from that point in time come and take possession and in the hebrew language that's often how they spoke i think it's probably not very politically correct today to purchase your bride and take her as a possession in our day and age we're a little more revelated today a whole other topic so there's there has to be that sum of money that's paid but then there has to be an acquisition of that which has been paid you have to come and take possession of your property okay again i'm sorry for that language in our day and age but we're christ's property that's how the bible speaks i'm not sorry for how the bible speaks we are his purchased possession he he paid the price he shed his blood great price great suffering but it hadn't taken taken his possession that's what the seals is all about right he's there's two parts of redemption paying the price taking possession when he took the book i'm getting ahead of myself but i might as well when he when he took the book what is he doing he's saying this is my this is the title deed to my property the names of everyone are on that the truth about who they are is on that right and so i'm gonna take my possession now of my property he breaks open those seals he comes down and says okay i'm gonna join be one with that which i purchased matthew 25 1-13 the parallel of the ten virgins of course you know this is this is just to give a picture of what marriage is in this case he's typing believers as the bridesmaids he's not typing them as a bride specifically in this but it gives us a picture of a marriage in those days then shall the kingdom of heaven be likened unto ten virgins which took their lamps and went forth to meet the bridegroom and five of them were wise and five were foolish so they knew that the bridegroom was coming the the hour was set the time was set he's coming but they don't know exactly when he's going to arrive all right so they go out to meet him they that were foolish took their lamps and took no oil with them but the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps while the bridegroom tarried they all slumbered and slept and at midnight there was a cried maid behold the bridegroom cometh go you out to meet him that's the message so the message is is a cry that the bridegroom is coming go go out to meet him verse 7 then all those virgins arose and trim their lamps and the foolish said unto the wise give us of your oil for our lamps are gone out but the wise answered saying not so lest there not be not enough for us and you but go ye rather to them that sell and buy for yourselves and while they went to buy the bridegroom came and they that were ready went in with him to the marriage or the nuptials and the door was shut afterward came also the other virgins saying lord lord open to us but he answered and said verily i say unto you i know you not watch therefore for you know neither the day nor the hour wherein the son of man cometh so i don't want i want to get sidetracked in the teaching about the ten virgins the picture is a marriage the son is leaving the father's house to retrieve his espoused wife they're going to have a ceremony then they're going to go into a tent and they're going to be joined together as one flesh that is for the for the jewish tradition and and the biblical custom the ceremony is not what joins them together it's them coming together in a physical union in the tent that makes them married that completes the process of marriage all right so in those days it was customary for the son to choose a friend to communicate on his behalf he's called a friend or a companion of the bridegroom judges 14 10 and 11. so his father went down under the woman and samson made there a feast for so used the young men to do and it came to pass when they saw him that they brought 30 companions to be with him so the companions of the bridegroom that's like what we call groomsmen today but a different responsibility in a different picture so here is the choosing out of 30 companions for him after he goes down there to make the feast so john 3 29 says he hath he that has the bride is the bridegroom but the friend of the bridegroom which standeth and heareth him rejoices greatly because of the bridegroom's voice this my joy therefore is fulfilled so as john the baptist forerand the first coming of christ there's a friend of the bridegroom brother branham was sent with a message to forerun the second coming of christ another friend of the bridegroom who is the one that says behold the bridegroom comes it's the friend that's the best man it's the friend of the bridegroom all right john 2 8 and 9 and he saith unto them draw out now and bear unto the governor of the feast and they bear it when the ruler of the feast had tasted the water that was made wine and knew not whence it was but the servants which drew the water knew the governor of the feast called the bridegroom again here's here's another title the governor of the feast governor of the feast many times was the friend of the bridegroom so here we have the marriage taking place and who's who's presiding over it the best man it's beautiful there's another word that's connected with marriage in the bible it's called the hoopa this is spoken of several times psalm 19 verse 5 which is as a bridegroom coming out of his chamber or his hoopa and rejoiceth as a strong man to run a race the next one is isaiah 4 5 and the lord will create upon every dwelling place of mount zion and there are upon her assemblies a cloud and smoke by day and the shining of a flaming fire by night for upon all the glory shall be a defense but that's the word hoopa so for all the glory shall be a hoopa so this again speaking of the place of marriage joel 2 verse 16 says gather the people sanctify the congregation assemble the elders gather the children and those that suck the breasts let the bridegroom go forth of his chamber this is speaks of his inner apartment and the bride out of her closet the hoopa okay so when the marriage nuptials as they call it take place it was first this is the taking possession portion of of marriage when those take take place first there's a ceremony which is performed by a rabbi but it's under a garment which is held up by four poles in other words it's like an open tent now i'm not trying to make great interpretations of tent visions and those different things i let the lord take care of that but there's a lot of pictures in brother branham's visions that you can see all over the bible and so here we have a great thing under the third pole taking place under a tent well the same thing there there's tents and things that are so important here in the marriage ceremony in the jewish culture so they have the ceremony again but then they go into the bridegroom's apartment or his inner chamber it's either a tent or a private secret room where husband and wife are joined together and then they come out and have a feast it's very strange but even today if you were to go to an orthodox jewish wedding they have a special room set aside for the husband and wife they're at the wedding hall for the jewish customs all right and it's a secret place right it's only for the bride and groom to be together to join as one in that place so i'm going to read again the quote i only had a portion of it before i want to read the whole thing from proving his word now remember that was not jesus talking to abraham there that could discern the thoughts and sarah's mind behind him that was not jesus he had not yet been born but it was a man in human flesh that abraham called elohim the great almighty showing and jesus said it as it was in the days of sodom now watch close in the days of sodom so will it be at the coming of the son of man when the son of man is being revealed not no more as a church see not no more the bride is called see in that day the son of man revealed will be revealed what to join the church to the head unite the marriage of the bride the bridegroom call will come right under right through this when the son of man will come down and come in human flesh to unite the two together the church has to be the word he is the word and the two unites together and to do that it'll take the manifestation of the revealing of the son of man not a clergyman i don't know i do you see what i mean see it's the son of man jesus christ will come down in human flesh among us and will make his word so real that he'll unite the church and him as one the bride and then shall go home to the wedding supper amen she's already united see we go to the wedding supper not to the marriage fill your flesh of all the flesh of the mighty man because the marriage of the lamb has come but the rapture is going to the wedding supper when the word here unites with the person and they too become one and then what does does it do to them it manifests the son of man again not the church theologians the son of man the word and the church becomes one whatever the son of man done he was the word the church does the same thing amen there's an invisible union that's taking it's a spiritual marriage it's not a physical marriage it's a spiritual one what does it take the son of man coming down in spirit form to come into his bride and be one with her that what is what what is that that took place a marriage a joining together an invisible union that's the picture that we're seeing today uh genesis 24 67 and isaac brought her into his mother sarah's tent again a tent in the picture in marriage i i i want to emphasize i'm not trying to interpret brother branham's vision okay but it's very interesting that this image of a tent would be there and you go in one way and you come out another way that's very interesting what all that means i don't know but when i look at the bible and see marriage i see tense so isaac brought her brought her into his mother sarah's tent and took rebecca and she became his wife and he loved her and isaac was comforted after his mother's death this is the claiming of the purchased possession now she's now she's his wife they're one so then we come to deuteronomy 22. again more of the marriage traditions will read through this somewhat quickly if any man take a wife and go in unto her and hate her and give occasions of speech against her and bring up an evil name upon her and say i took this woman and when i came to her i found her not a maid then shall the father of the damsel and her mother take and bring forth the token of the damsel's virginity unto the elders of the city and the gate and the damsel father shall say unto the elders i'm not going to expound on this you're going to have to read between the lines there's kids here take and bring forth the tokens of the damsel's virginity and the elders of the city and the gate and the damsel's father shall say unto the elders i gave my daughter under this man to wife and he hateth her and lo he hath given occasions of speech against her saying i found not a daughter thy daughter a maid yet these are the tokens amen these are the tokens of my daughter's virginity and they shall spread the cloth before the elders of the city then the elders of that city shall take that man and chastise him and they shall immerse him in a hundred shekels of silver and give up them unto the father of the damsel because he hath brought up an evil name upon a virgin of israel and she shall be his wife he may not put her away all his days but if this thing be true and the tokens of virginity be not found for the damsel so that's what i want to emphasize is there's tokens there's a token of your virginity he said you're a virtuous bride of christ you never sinned in the first place and he gave us a token amen he gave us the holy ghost the life that's in the blood that's the token to us today his very presence the son of man coming down into a body of people to reveal himself through that people that's the token of your virginity amen all right next let us be glad and rejoice and give honor unto him for the marriage of the lamb is come and his wife have made herself ready and to her was granted that she should be arrayed in fine linen clean and white for the fine linen is the righteousness of saints and he's he saith unto me right blessed are they which are called unto the marriage supper of the lamb and he sayeth unto me these are the true sayings of god brother branham was sent with a message to dress a bride amen so us making ourselves ready is what working ourselves into righteousness no we receive his righteousness right but it's it's that that token of the holy ghost coming into us making us that virgin for christ and what is it that's dr that word is addressing the bride amen and so we see there the marriage is one thing and then the marriage supper that verse speaks of two different things it's exactly what brother branham said you have the marriage of the lamb we're already married we're already joined in an invisible union then we have the second part which is what we're called unto which is the marriage supper that's what we go to when the rapture takes place so we see all these types and these shadows we see the betrothal taking place when christ drinks the wine with his disciples we see christ paying the price for his musicians if you'd come brother tony christ pays that price for his bride to purchase his bride at calvary then in this hour he comes down with an open book he comes by he takes what does he take he takes the title deed of his of his bride it takes that title deed and he says i'm claiming my possession and he comes down in spirit form he takes that bride and what does he do he becomes one with her consummates the marriage with her the word and the bride are one she is him now what what are we doing we're being made ready to go to the marriage feast amen it's a spiritual union of christ and the bride all right let's stand and pray heavenly father lord we're so so very thankful lord for the revealing of your word in this hour how you make it clear to us as the bride lord we can we can do our best to try to make these things plain and clear but lord it takes a spiritual revelation so i pray that you'd come lord and take this teaching this morning lord and establish it do the supernatural portion establishing it in the hearts of the people that they would see their positions see who they are see their place lord and enter into what you've called them to lord we thank you for these things lord we ask for each one here today lord no doubt many different things going on in in people's lives and people are seeking your face and and looking to find your will and find your purpose people are seeking healing and restoration in their lives lord i pray that you would come even now lord and establish your word in their hearts that they would see lord that it's already finished it's already done they already have what they have need of it's by the spirit by that token living inside of them that it comes lord we thank you for these things we ask it in the name of jesus christ amen amen because of who you are because of who you because of who you are i hear your glory [Music] because of who you are [Music] who you are i will lift my voice and say lord i worship you because of who you are lord i worship you because of who you are jehovah [Music] [Music] and i worship you because of who you are and i worship you because of who you are because of who you [Music] of are you are i give you great praise because of who you are i will my live saying lord i worship you because of who you are lord i worship because of who you are [Music] [Applause] jehovah [Music] and i worship you because of who you are jehovah [Applause] [Music] lord you [Music] and i worship you because of who you are [Music] and i worship you because of who you are [Music] aren't you glad to be a believer today hey man i am so glad amen [Music] [Applause] you know i was thinking about as brother jason was just tying it all together and winding it up there i thought my isn't that incredible how that the i mean do you realize that our approach to even what it means to be a christian and what it means to be in union with christ is so opposite from the the rest of christianity who looks to some kind of organized denominational system you know you ever hear the old statement you can't trust the system believe me you can't trust those systems of man and i thought wow to be able to go through the bible and show how that what we understand to be a relationship with god what we understand to be real to be really the bride of christ in a relationship and to be able to track that to track it all through the scripture i i'd love to see somebody try to do that with denominationalism try to take denominationalism and track it and connect all those dots like that you know the bible speaks of denominationalism but it ain't good it is nowhere that you're going to find a harmony in the scripture like that to come out of the old testament into the new testament didn't matter where brother jason went he was able to show exactly what a prophet taught us about the invisible union about what it meant to have the seventh seal open to us it's not just doctrine is it friends it's not his knowledge it's a person amen you know i i thought about there right as you were you had you were beginning and you kept emphasizing and going back the way brother branham would say you know it's not open and but yet he's revealed it but then he's not revealed it but then it's been in the bible and you know it's not revealed say is the seventh seal revealed yeah you're it is it revealed to the public not the not not all the parts that pertain to the public believe me that's not something they're looking forward to because remember friends seventh seal runs all the way through the tribulation all the way through and there's parts of that of that seventh seal that are going to unfold you go home and read revelation 15 you'll find out there is things coming and the messengers that god sent to the earth and in every age there was a partial opening of a seal a rejection of the word a temporary judgment was set but hey when those seven messengers clothed in linen when they come out of the temple of god to bring forth judgment into the world it's not temporary it's not partial it's the full on vials it's the judgments on full amen and that to think about it friends that that when you go back and you look at those seven messengers and clearly you can see as brother branham was showing us and tying the scriptures together that the world is looking for seven new people to come and they don't realize god has sent seven messengers in seven ages and their message that they brought in every age gave life to the believer and judgment to the unbeliever and so who more fittingly than to be those ones associated with those vials because the judgments are upon the earth that's why brother branham would say when he was a white wig one there remember and he said that was what that white wig was of judge and he said what made it seven angels amen praise the lord all through it doesn't matter where you go in the scripture where you go in the message it all is one harmonious beautiful picture of god's plan don't never think that god is caught off guard by anything happening in your life god's got this whole thing planned out mapped out synced out i mean it's it's it's already moving you don't he doesn't even need you to move it it's moving you don't need to move him he's moving you friends amen i i feel that pull of god moving us and he's moving the world the world can't stop itself it's on a path to self-destruction and it jesus foretold it 2000 years ago told exactly what would happen it's happening it's happening exactly like christ foretold it would he knew it would he knew sending the disciples and sending the gospel around the world wouldn't stop that because that's all part of god's plan too i'm glad to be on the winning side of the plan amen i'm glad blessed are your eyes for they see and your ears for they hear oh many have desired to see and hear the things that we hear and see amen god bless you it's been wonderful to have you here today turn around and greet somebody you can remember you can shake their hand you can fist bump you can wave at them you can amen however you want it's up to you amen praise the lord god bless you we're happy to have any visitors here with us today amen happy
