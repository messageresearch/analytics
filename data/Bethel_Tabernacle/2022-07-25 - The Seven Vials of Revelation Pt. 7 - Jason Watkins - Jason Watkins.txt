========================================

are you catching I just hope I'm not confusing you I hope it's clear what is wrong is the way of Cinema sometimes it's not even sin it's just misunderstanding of people I think each one of us has a right to express ourselves to our understanding not that we disagree with you brother this is known to ones at the end time to be different many of you here might be trinitarian preachers we don't want to be angry with you we love you a trinitarian preacher we love you amen but yet somehow we have other message preachers that we can't stand and we hate and we're out to destroy and out to take a sword to yet the prophet says I love you trinitarian preachers we don't want to be angry with you we love you if we didn't if I didn't believe that I'd never leave this church till I got down there on my knees and said God make me right I don't want that arrogant selfish Spirit mixed up with mine raise my hand and say I don't want it Lord I want my spirit to be pure how many can raise a hand clean Brotherly Love holy he says holy with Holy Spirit now if someone does anything wrong to me that's all right and though I might have the right to get back at them I don't want that in my life I want to have love I want to be ready to correct with love so it was a balance he brought correction you can bring correction you can stand for the truth you can stand on your convictions you can be uncompromising and unwavering but you can be angry and sin not I want to be ready to correct with love with love that absolutely answers out of you out yonder for it I don't mean to be different Methodist Baptist Catholic Presbyterian whoever you are I don't say these things to be different be Arrogant with you if I did I'm a hypocrite and should be down here at this altar praying through to God but I say it's because of love I say it because of love and see where you're going now I don't say this in myself and say it I'm presuming I give you thus saith the Lord that is the truth and I love you for those things God bless you I'd rather this is where I'm going to end I'd rather have a church listen just for a moment I would rather have a church that knows nothing about any spiritual gift and just be so in love with each other and with Christ I'd rather have that than every spiritual gift operating in the church I'd rather have a church so in love one with another so in Harmony One with another I'd rather have that than all the spiritual gifts in my church how could brother Branham say that he's preaching against well did not the Apostle Paul say I can speak all know all the Mysteries I can speak in the tongues of men and angels and have not love I have nothing and he says I would rather have that than all the gifts operate in the church now that might sound hard in a Pentecostal group but I would rather have it where there is gifts they'll fail where there is gifts they'll bring confusion where there is gifts that they can be questioned but where there is love it is perfect that's right and if notice there's the key and if you had perfect love you'd have perfect gifts that's right so work first with love that brings fellowship and fellowship brings gifts Give the Lord a hand clap of praise Lord we thank you this morning for your word how accurate it is how laser accurate it is Lord you hit the bullseye your word hits the Mark we fail Lord we miss it but your word hits the mark every time in our heart May It Be an Arrow of Deliverance Lord where we can be delivered from ourself to have true christ-like love not worldly inclusive everybody just gets in and it doesn't matter no that's not true love Lord that's not true anger either Lord but real righteous indignation is to be able to tell someone that they're wrong and still love them and still showing and reflect Christ that's what we want Lord we just raise our hand and say we want to reflect you and all of our nature and all of our actions and all of our reactions help us to reflect you

Rachel Sweeney were here some years ago and we we knew James as a young man and as he grew up the devil got a hold of his mind and has just tormented him in that way that's what demons are they're tormentors amen so but we have authority over them aren't you glad for that aren't you glad you don't have to be victims to the enemy amen praise the Lord don't don't pity the devil whatever you do don't feel sorry for him amen he's God he's gonna he's got his coming amen praise the Lord you don't want to pity him there's nothing worse than a you know what's one of the one of the classic signs of a narcissist shows you that Satan is the chief narcissist because a narcissist wants pity for a problem they created yeah so don't don't pity him amen put him in his place let him know you're the Bride of Jesus Christ and we take authority over him amen praise the Lord um um so let's let's sing this and then we'll read our scripture amen you love [Applause] I um for you oh let the whole world hear it and some days foreign [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] Lord we thank you this morning for your presence in our midst thank you for Gathering these people here Lord under your care we're turning now to the word that most important part lord of the service I Surrender myself right readily Lord just fresh right now humbling myself as brother Brennan said I humbled myself and then I humbled myself again Lord help us now we want to be your servant's father taking no thought of our own these are these are this is a a serious hour and time is it's so vital that we redeem the time for the days are short we must see you in your movements at every Junction Lord so help us now today to be not only hearers of your word but doers we're asking special prayer for sister Linda Lord Paris today and and brother James Sweeney you see the enemy Lord bothering them from that end but Lord we're here on this end praying for them we're lifting them up in the name of Jesus that you would bring Liberty Lord God that you would bring healing that you would put the enemy in his place oh God take away pain mind body and soul replace it with life and Liberty in the Holy Spirit Lord and Divine Healing uh in in the body father I'm thinking of Chris my son today started feeling bad on on Friday and not feeling good today and so father asking to you to you to touch him as well today we commit all of these things now in the reading the preaching and the hearing of the word there is a blessing the Bible says in just reading it there's even a blessing in just hearing it read so we're counting on you for that blessing today we commit it to you in Jesus name amen God bless you Luke chapter 17 while you're standing Luke chapter 17 I think that was all of my announcements amen amen praise the Lord Luke Chapter 17. now let me get all of my ducks in a row here we're continuing Today part 7 teaching on the seven vows of Revelation now we've just remind you again we're we're very deep into this series we've already covered um you know as far as like looking at at um at the seven vials as they relate to the symbology there we're really only dealing with One released into the air because uh it appears from everything that I can see as a student that the rest of it will be in the in the tribulation period so brother Branham only identified clearly the part that was released into the air and announced to us and I put the quotes up here that those judgments you are reading under that vial began with the Alaska earthquake and there that's why you see the world going into the situation it's in it's because there's a there's a an Airborne infection in the minds of mankind driving the insanity of the world and leading him to a tribulation period I'm glad we're going to be taken out amen do you want to hear come up amen do you want to hear come up amen will you make sure you hear come out because if you don't hear come out and you don't follow that you'll never hear come up amen amen Luke 17 and we'll we'll read this portion of it so Matt I I think I posted to you that we would go from Luke and then into Matthew but once we read Luke then put my PowerPoint up and I'll catch Matthew there amen Luke 17 verse 24. for as the lightning that shineth out of one part under Heaven shineth unto the other part under heaven so shall also the son of man be in his day so this is all going to happen under Heaven before the bride goes home all right this is not going to happen in heaven this is happening under Heaven it's just like when you look at the tribes of Dan and Ephraim you can see it in the Old Testament but when you when you when you when you look at at God showing the the tribes on the other side that Dan and Ephraim are are omitted because they were put out of the family under heaven but when you read the millennial scriptures and the new heavens and the new Earth you find them put back because brother Branham said it was only under heaven but they're written in the palms of his hands they can never deny them they'll be restored in Heaven All right so so we read here something that's happening in human history uh from the lightning out of one part under Heaven shineth unto the other part under heaven so shall also the son of man be in his day but first must he suffer many things verse 25 and be rejected of this generation all right now that's uh that's uh it sounds like it's a one-off but you've just heard that it's from east to west so as the generations move in every generation he was rejected in every generation including this last generation this is why the unwise Virgin who is the remnant of the woman's seed she goes into the tribulation a Time the Bible says there's never been a tribulation like it in the earth say my it's like why did why did the seventh age the the first six uh ages of the foolish virgin didn't have to they're not gonna have to go through that you're correct why does the seventh because they rejected the consummation of all the ages and all the messages and everything they rejected the greatest message that the Earth has ever had Christ in his second appearing that this is the greatest uh of all of them because this is the consummation of everything all right so first must he suffer many things and be rejected of this generation now watch is going to now talk about the end time we're going to make a multi-millennial leap to the last age verse 26 and as it was in the days of Noah so shall it be also in the days of the son of man they did eat they drank they married wives they were given in marriage sounds like our day right until the day that Noah entered into the ark and the flood came and destroyed them all likewise also as it was in the days of lot now we've pointed out to you that this that's one of the unique Mark markers for the last day where the only age this is one way we're unique there's a number of ways there's one of them this last day bride must face the days of Noah and the days of lot simultaneously it's like a double barrel shotgun we're the only age that's ever had to face that see all right verse 28 likewise also as it was in the days of lot they did eat they drank they bought they sold they planted they builted but the same day that lot went out of Sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven and destroyed them all so once The Messengers to Sodom were gone off the scene the fire fell all right and the two Messengers to Sodom have gone off the scene all right but the same day that lot went out of Sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven and destroyed them all even thus here it is here's another clue again even thus shall it be in the day when the son of man is revealed may the Lord bless the reading of his word and you can be seated amen amen praise the Lord so I I'm I'm I know she told me not to do it but I or not to make a big deal out of it but I sure am missing uh the first lady today and she's visiting with some friends and went to see sister Sherry so I'll probably only preach 15 minutes today because when I get out of here I'm going to get her so but I'll let you know when I start preaching don't start timing me till I till I let you know amen praise the Lord all right so now we're going to move to the overhead and we're continuing the seven vials of Revelation and today I want to take the subtitle earnestly contending for the faith and I I could have easily took taken that scripture and read that but uh it's it's not necessary you're familiar the church was warned to earnestly contend for the faith once delivered to the Saints that's because the Ephesus was going to fall away and it was going to go off and get worse and worse with each age Go off into the Dark Ages and then God would restore um in those same stages the four stages that ate it down the four stages would be its restoration and we are in the final fourth and last stage which is the fruit of Christ Living in the lives like fruit back in the top it's a bride tree amen and so we realize that we are now uh in that sequence of events it's a setting of History a setting of Prophecy as brother Brandon would call it so we find here then that uh we're going to continue now and I'm going to continue reading in the scripture but I wanted to put this on the overhead now we've read from the Gospel of Luke concerning the time when the ministry would go to the son of man now here's an important Point all right I got everybody's attention because we're subject preaching today it's kind of like teaching but I'm not suit so good at that I'm good at subject preaching so if I get going you'll understand why so and then you can start my 15-minute timer but but we find out that that when you when you look at the prophecy in the Book of Luke it shows us the hour that we have arrived at now that's important because I I'm saying to you that that's the that's the message we need to earnestly contend for the ministry of the son of man all right uh brought to us through the office of the son of man now I'm going to repeat some things that you all are taught well in but for the sake of the recording the archive and and streamers and visitors sometimes I have to repeat stuff when we're teaching like this but you're you're going to realize then that the that when God comes in restoration you're never going to diminish it's not a subtraction so when that which is perfect is come then that which is in part is done away you're familiar with that a lot of people take that to mean that when the perfect word comes we no longer need the gifts of the Spirit that's not what the Bible is saying because that's a reduction of the Holy Ghost you don't want to have that in your mind what it means is is that the way we operated them under partial understanding we no longer do it that way we now have full understanding amen so now it's a mature bride he was never coming to marry a little girl he was coming to marry a mature bride and that's the age we have arrived at so when he when he goes from the Son of God and he's in the he's in the ages of Son of God I still got your attention I'm going to really make some technical uh points here all right so when he was in the ages in the ministry of the son of God it's prophesied in Luke 17 that he's going to come at the end time in the last generation back in the office and Ministry he's coming back in the office of son of man to bring back the ministry of the son of man now the office is the prophet the ministry is the people who become the word because the ministry of the son of man is the word made flesh you got it the office is a prophet the office of Son of Man the ministry of the son of man is the word made flesh that's what Paul had in his day that's why this is a restoration of that original truth and that's the message we are to earnestly contend for I know it's and it's not about getting out I mean fine if you want to go on a street corner and declare Malachi 4 for um how you know but but what's but are you declaring it on the job are you declaring it in the schools by your life are you declaring it in your places of business is your life worthy of the Gospel does your life project the truth of what God has done in this hour see and so when he comes as son of man and he say all right then we don't have the age of Son of God anymore and there's where you'd be wrong because you're trying to make a reduction again remember that the that the ministry that Christ entered into remember when his Earthly Ministry he was son of man right he was the word made flesh am I right then then he went into the spirit and that's and now he's is in the ages and you say well he was in Son of God as a as a uh in the in the eternities interceding on behalf of the of the ignorance of the church well he eventually had to do that of course but that but that early church those first couple of early decades there was no ignorance they had the full Jubilee they had the token they had the opening of the word Paul understood Melchizedek Paul understood the coming of the Lord Paul understood the rapture you understand this message isn't an addition to Paul's teaching it's a restoration Paul understood election and serpent seed and baptism and the godhead and the Mystery of the Bride Body of Christ there is nothing we preach in this message that's not based on what Paul taught in fact is if you're teaching something Paul taught you're a false prophet see and brother Branham said that the reason that makes you a false prophet he said like the pope he's a false prophet he's a prophet because he's a preacher see he's a new testament Prophet New Testament preacher but he what he's preaching is contrary to scripture so that makes him a false prophet see you can be a you can be a real Prophet but that doesn't mean you're a true prophet you can a lot of false prophets Balaam was a real prophet but he was a false prophet amen so so we see that the that the anointing rain falls on the just and the unjust Delight so we find then that that brother pray you say well but he's the son of God because he's he's he's pleading fragrance of course he did as the as as they kept you know losing uh the understanding of the word it sealed up to the end time Christ sits back down in the eternities to intercede for his family but also but also also also the ministry of the Son of God brother Branham explained it this way that when he was in his Earthly pilgrimage as son of man word made flesh then he went into Son of God brother Branham says which was the supernatural because he wasn't flesh that's why the Bible says we we knew Christ after the flesh but we know him no longer after the flesh we know him by the spirit he's now Supernatural and that Supernatural Spirit was in every age and it's all the way down today and just because we come to the ministry and the office of the son of man it's not a reduction of the supernatural it's actually a perfection because once again the Supernatural is living in a family of God who are walking by the saith the Lord you get me it's an important transition you mustn't lose so so we find then that when we pick up now we're going to go to Matthew's gospel chapter 24 is where brother Branham would go for prophetic teaching many times immediately after the tribulation of those days shall the sun be darkened and the moon shall not give her light now it's coming to the end into the world and the Stars shall fall from Heaven and the powers of the heavens shall be shaken and then shall appear the sign of the son of man now that's an important prophecy catch it now there's an appearance all right then shall appear the sign of the son of man in heaven and now first let me say to you people sometimes mistakenly think this is the cloud over Arizona and that's not accurate because this is at the end of the tribulation there's another scripture that does refer to what happened in Arizona this ain't that all right all right and then shall appear you can see the description you can see the context immediately after the tribulation of those days it's at the end of the tribulation all right and it goes down verse 30 and then shall appear the sign of the son of man in heaven this is now Revelation 19 when he comes riding Out of Heaven on a white horse remember and his vesture dipped in blood his name is called the word of God amen and and the armies of Heaven following him which is the bride at the end of the tribulation all right this is why the scripture says that when they when they see him this is not Lo where we're going to read it here and then shall appear the sign of the son of man in heaven and then shall also then oh I'm sorry and then shall all the tribes of the earth mourn now it's hard to imagine you mourning to see Jesus I mean to us as a Believer is it not true that to see him in the skies when we meet him in the air is that not the quest of the of all Journey yeah the quest of all quests the Journey of all Journeys isn't that why we are a Believer isn't that why we're we're fighting it out isn't that why we've taken our stand isn't that why we believe what God has done to this day to see him in the air three of you just see him in the air about 12 of you just see him in the air to meet him at last the one I've lived for my whole life since a boy looked for that day that morning that breaks Eternal pride and fair oh my God then then shall appear the sign of the son of man in heaven and then shall all the tribes of the earth mourn and they shall see the son of man coming in the Clouds Of Heaven with power and great Glory so this is another description of Revelation 19 the armies of Heaven following him because it's the because it's the sign of the son of man and and the son of man is word made flesh see and it's coming in clouds and you're surrounded by a cloud of many witnesses Hallelujah see and and and in heaven with power and great Glory because at that point the queen is now speaking with the king in perfect Authority now it's Esther and the hazarus on the throne and Nehemiah at the time of feast of trumpets going back to restore Israel now Moses and Elijah Hallelujah friends have completed their course and a pride is in one voice with Christ and it's we've went through the whole tribulation and now we've come back out in in chapter 19 or Matthew 24 30. see now I can't just say that I got to prove it all right now because notice it doesn't say coming even though he he does come out of heaven and it's for real this is not a metaphor they actually see him right but now watch now John was so sure that he was going to see the Messiah till he said he's in our midst now now watch notice there's a great big difference in the sign of Jesus appearing and then Jesus coming those two different words means two different things the appearing over the Lord and the coming of the Lord all right the coming of the Lord is when we meet him in the air see but when when Revelation 19 occurs there's an appearing of that Lord with his bride in Perfection and the whole earth will see it and mourn so so so so so so so then accurately verse 30 is not the rapture the Rapture had taken place three and a half years prior and the world missed it this is why they mourn because now it becomes evident that that little man was right and the people that they held in derision and ridiculed are now appearing with him in clouds of glory and Power oh the Bible is so flawless see so he says the the at the bottom the appearing of the Lord and the coming of the Lord he go now now the appearing is that same yeah now the appearing of the Lord is now when he's appearing in his people see that's why the sign of the son of man appears because what is it it's the Lord and his people the glory in power in a cloud amen see so so we find then that his Spirit what is it his Spirit working among them proving that it's him with them getting them ready for the Rapture for the coming of the Lord to catch away his bride the appearing and the coming that is exactly how this is if they don't say it prayer although I think they will I think many who want to reject uh William Branham now but brother Branham said someday they'll say that little man was right and and I think maybe when California and then when all the plaques start coming but for sure at verse 30 of Matthew 24. for sure see because of this principle they're going to see the appearing and that's his coming all right and it but but what the significance of verse 30 is what what what that what that coming in Revelation 19 is as an appearing you follow me it's Christ working the spirit among them and you've got the word made flesh as it was in the days of lot as it was in the days of Noah so shall it be in the coming of the son of man the word made flesh again watch so he goes on uh oh wait okay now um did I get it yeah okay I'll make sure where I'm at all right now uh it's when he is presented people all right all right now the thing we have to do if if we can believe it and be concerned about it first we got to be convinced that it is God then when we're convinced then we are concerned I like that all right now I'm going to take something friends what what causes a preacher especially a pastor but all preachers but particularly pastors what what call what's the leading cause of the pastor losing sleep at night is people who actually see it and are convinced of it but aren't very concerned even though when you see it and acknowledge it that it's true then you already know we're at the end time because what you've now believed wasn't coming until the end time and you see the world going into chaos and you actually see the results you can read about the things happening in the tribulation and brother Branham in his vials series that's not titled that but as we've been teaching you from it where that was the theme of his heart because those are the things that that we need to know because of this Airborne infection that that when brother Brandon began to bring the word of God that that is a sign to you and I that we have arrived in the last days and that's where brother Brandon would say now listen to watch watch brother Brandon would say now he you can go in the Book of Revelation and read about some of the things that happened on the seventh vial let me give you some of brother branham's and I read them for you where brother Branham said man will go so insane that they will see ants crawling on the earth the size of multi-story I forget how many said 3 every story or so uh hi in their imaginary mind and their imaginary mind there's no ants the tribulation isn't going to produce ants multi-story buildings birds with wingspans five miles across like like Raptors like prehistoric creatures they're not actually going to be there but man in his imaginary mind is going to go that crazy and he'll run and scream that's tribulation things that are going to be happening Andy do you know do you know why they do you know why they arrive there because they're not convinced or concerned and they just keep feeding on the things of the world but you God has called you aside to say come out of her my people don't be like that don't get caught there in that insanity and the word has come today and I and and so what I want to try to drive into your hearts is if you're convinced then be concerned be concerned with your prayer life be concerned with your attended church attendance be concerned with the example that you set in front of your children be concerned as a teenager be concerned that your light you see when when Paul goes to a woman you know cutting her hair and and it's so I find it almost amusing if it weren't so sad and right away when people leave the message first thing the women do is cut their hair and put on pants and wear makeup and it's across the board it happens every single time and they say I say and well because I don't have to listen to William Branham anymore Time Out Hold Up Wait stop women cutting their hair it's not a William Branham Doctrine you won't have to worry about William Brennan that's a Saint Paul a woman putting on a garment that pertains to a man is not a William Branham teaching that's a Moses teacher see and and as far as Jezebel all you got to do is go back and look at Elijah and so it won't do you any good even if you believe William Brandon was false and even if you end up right you're still gonna have to deal with Paul and Moses and Elijah see that shows you how far the devil can break their mind and break their mind to think like that see and have no concern and Paul when he talks about a woman cutting her hair you have to realize the emphasis that Paul is trying to make when it comes to you know adorning herself uh which means beautifying there's nothing wrong with a woman beautifying herself brother REM said it's in her nature there's nothing wrong with that but it but it's to be done modestly in the spirit of Christ see and and brother Branham said you don't want to go walking like you went through a five and dime with a magnet on and and the length of your skirts matters the the your your upper Clothing Matters say why is it always on the women well okay you mean besides the fact that a woman's body's sacred you mean other than that because she brings life into the Earth and her body's sacred and and so and so so brother so Paul brother Paul his whole point is to say that what is what would be a travesty what would be so sad what would be so wrong this picture would be so wrong if you were in public and someone who didn't know you and saw how you were dressed and mistook you for an unbeliever and thought by the way you're dressed you're not even a Christian Paul is saying that would be horrible that would be such a slap to the face of the Lord Jesus that somebody would accidentally because of the attitude you had the words you were saying the things you were doing where you were going what you were doing what you were wearing how you were dressing how you were conducting yourself that anyone could see you and mistake you for a person of the world you are to be a bright and Shining Light see see so it's not it's not Paul trying to be hard on women they call him a woman hater and that is unjustified and it's unfair he was not he Paul loved the females of the of God's family and that his sisters in Christ he wanted them to be holy because they were uh they were a portrait of the Bride of the Lord Jesus Christ see and then he wanted men to take the position of of Christ himself as the high priest of the home you know I was just I was speaking to a young man here recently and I was giving him a testimony about another conversation I had with another young man recently and this other young man was married with Children and you know I felt the need uh this is some time ago quite a ways back it's nothing like that today and I felt the need to take him aside and say listen my dear brother because I could you could see love of the Lord and he was a firm believer and I said you've gotta you hear you've got a you've got a house full of youngins and I it's pretty easy to see that you know how to sow seed and produce human beings I I can see that you got a house full of children but do you know how to sow a spiritual seed do you know how to reproduce Christ in your family see it's one thing to be able to do it naturally that's just nature but what what what what the what the married sisters need my brothers what the what the single sisters who will be married eventually my brothers what they need is men who are living men in the image of their maker who are who are who are taking their position as a high priest in the home you remember as I've said before say it to young men all over the world manhood is not a gender you don't get to be a man just because you're a male brother Brandon said I've seen men 50 six foot 200 pounds and have ounce of man in them I've seen men 70. six foot 200 pounds didn't have ounce of man in them because manhood manhood is not a gender you don't get to automatically be a man just because you're a male of advanced years manhood is an office that speaks of character it speaks of loyalty it speaks of honesty it speaks of Integrity it speaks of perseverance it speaks of strength it speaks of determination Hallelujah it means you have the ability to make a decision for God and live that way and go forward and display it in your life there was the committal of Abraham that God so admired his his level of commitment didn't matter what happened he was not gonna he was gonna believe God's word going forward see all right I'm only going to get 15 minutes to preach I've already get to it so brother Branham says you know it's about believing it and then being concerned about it if you're going to believe it be concerned enough to let it make the changes that you need in your life or your life is Unworthy of the Gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ and since this gospel is dripping with the blood of the martyrs and the blood of Christ I don't think this Pulpit should ever let the gospel become a cheap gospel some easy believism come on preachers come on Amen come on amen amen don't ever let it be easy believe is if you get behind this Pulpit preach preach Hallelujah repent or perish Hallelujah we have no room for compromise he goes on in a couple months about a month or two later in perseverance did you know that the Bible speaks of the appearing of the Lord and also the coming of the lord it's two different Works search it and find it out if that's right they're peering and the coming is two different things all right you with me all right the appearing of the Lord is now he's appearing amongst his people there it is again see that's the appearing that's why in Matthew 24 30 it's an appearing of the sign of the son of man all right the Lord and his people all right appearing among his people we see him in his same works the appearing his holy spirit but his coming will be in a physical being it'll be to catch the church up you want to be a part of that you want to be in that number now when that angel of the Lord come to Abraham there in the time before the destruction now that was God appearing in human flesh and Jesus said as it was in the days of Noah so will it be in the coming of the son of man as it was in the days of lot he give the morals of what they were doing in the days of Noah now it's significant in the Bible that he didn't say as it was in the days of Enoch and Abraham see it was in the days of Noah and lot because Noah and lot are types of going through the tribulation Noah particularly the Jews the 144 000 brother Branham said one place he talks about it and and it's a little bit ambiguous that it's also a type of the foolish virgin but his main point was Noah going through the tribulation uh was was the 144 thousand who goes through the tribulation to be purged amen and so and then and then you have lot the and brother Branham talks about Abraham up on the hill he had the sign of Melchizedek see and he not built a pyramid and walked home to heaven could you imagine letting this be built up you will one of these days it's going to be so built up in you you're going to get so close to Heaven that you're just going to step into another dimension Glory glory to God I look forward to that hour Hallelujah see as it was in the days of Noah all right in the days of lot watch the messenger to Abraham watch The Messengers to lot and the nominal church just come out come out and Abraham pleading for them notice the Angel God Elohim appearing in the form of human flesh shows that Elohim in the last days will appear watch not the coming of Christ but the appearing of Christ in human flesh in his church making his same signs so this appearing leads to that coming amen amen so not the coming of Christ but the appearing of Christ in human flesh in his church making his same signs and things he and things he did and hasn't done it in the church for 2 000 years see the appearing of Our Lord all right now now we can go forward now come back verse 31. you good and he shall send his angels with a great sound of a trumpet see this is how he does it and they shall gather together his elect from the Four Winds from one end of Heaven to the other that's now you're back to Matthew 13. see they they correlate Matthew 13 Matthew 24 Revelation goes all the way from chapters one now we're all the way over to chapter 16 in the vials and you finally end up with a spirit and a bride say come this is all working together in Matthew 13 what did he do he would he would send his angels to do what separate the good from the bad that's his preachers that's his ministers they they sound a trumpet now we're not talking about the great trumpet see we're not talking about the trumpet to Israel we're talking I'm not talking about the great trumpet that brings the sleeping dead we're talking about the gospel trumpet that he will send forth his Messengers how do you know it's a true Messenger he'll have the true gospel trumpet for his hour he might not be pretty he might not be smart he might not be popular but he'll have the saith the Lord and it becomes it's incumbent upon you to follow that if you want to live and he shall send his angels and and it shall go on for me even after the bride is gone it'll be Moses and Elijah remember when the bride leaves Grace is Gone remember because Grace is the camp of the redeemed it's the encampment of the redeemed it's part of Elections part of your origin amen amen amen see and and and and and that ego anointing doesn't go back to Heaven that fourth flight that fourth creature it goes all the way as soon as the Gentile bride goes up Grace is over for the for the Gentiles because the bride takes the the grace and the blood of Christ with her because say we take the blood Shore you you are the blood of God by the spirit it's not the chemistry the chemistry ran down across and fell on the earth and claimed the Earth for a millennium but it's the Life In The Blood that's a token that comes into your life and when the bride leaves physically because she's now the word the blood and the spirit of God is in her she's the word made flesh she is Grace she's Mrs Jesus Christ she's under the eagle anointing just because a prophet went home just because the office of son of man went home that doesn't stop the ministry of the son of man or the Flying Eagle upon the bride that's why she has thus says in order she keeps still in other words her whole life is lived by thus Sith Lord and nothing else she she the womb is sealed she won't hear another man-made idea she won't be wooed by the siren song of Lucifer and Satan's Eden she closes her ears and eyes to that she wants only the word of God see and so so we find then that this is so beautiful so so he sends them and as soon as the bride leaves then the eagle anointing lifts up flies East picks up Moses and Elijah and goes to the 144 000. there in Israel not all Israel's Israel but God knoweth him that are his see so so it's it's the trumpets going and then of course it's the the proper Jewish trumpets Moses and Elijah operating and they're going to be the ones who give a verse by verse breakdown to Israel brother Brandon wanted to he he wasn't allowed because it wasn't necessary he gave verse by verse in the ages verse by verse and the seals when it came to the trumpets and the vowels wasn't necessary he took eight or nine services to show you the impact that the seventh vial is having on the day and hour that we live in he took these sermons to show you and taught on Revelation to show you that they were partially fulfilled in every age but they're coming because seven is the completion sevens all your sevens are the completion so in after the seventh age and it goes into the tribulation under the seventh trumpet then that's then that's the full cup of God's indignation and wrath poured out no wonder it says there's never been a day like it never will be again so I I feel like I'm going so fast I hope you're staying caught up all right I'll start my preaching in a few minutes and then and and he shall send his angels with the with a great sound of a trumpet and they shall gather together his elect from the Four Winds from one end of Heaven to the other now all right now he's going to back up and say okay now I'm going to give you a sign I'm about to show you a sign that that is so clear it won't seem clear to you now Church you're the early church you don't even know I'm not even going to tell you that it's going to be 2 000 years I'm going to let you think it's imminent in every age I don't want to discourage you brother Brian said I want to discouraged them so here he is he's not even going to let him know that it's going to be Seven Ages 2020 centuries but he's coming now to the last one and there ain't another one and he's saying now I'm going to let you know how this is going to unfold I'm going to give you a sign when the lightning has traveled under the heaven prior to the Rapture has traveled under the heaven in human history all the way from east to west when that happens then you're going to see the the light it's going to look like Noah's day it's going to look like lot's day and that's the time when I'm going to reveal the office again of son of man and that's going to produce the ministry of the son of man and a people who are then the glory and power of God when he appears at the end time I mean this stuff is mind-blowing when you see it all put together you realize this was put together by a very brilliant mind I'm entertain something he accounted for everything there's nothing take courage in this there's nothing that you can encounter from the Cradle to the Grave that's not covered he's thought of everything he's thought of everything he has a contingency as a plan he has a remedy all you got to do is walk in his will and you'll walk in his remedy Hallelujah you got cancer doesn't matter by his stripes are healed you got depression doesn't matter by his stripes the word of God is Health to all mind body and soul the word of God is Health to all your flesh hallelujah it's the imperishable seat if you'll plant it in your heart and confess it and thank God for it and don't never change it that seed will grow it will become a crop and you'll have a harvest of it lungs don't go back and take it up out of impatience and as soon as you doubt a promise you just dug it up you got to start over it's the imperishable seat just put it in the ground every farmer knows he's got to wait take care of it be convinced be concerned see it's your it's your health it's your strength this word is your health and your strength don't be careless with your health and your strength don't don't don't be careless with your overcoming energy don't be careless with the only thing that can clean you be convinced then concerned hear recognize and act see upon the word of God that's why it comes all right I might not get to preaching today all right now all right now so now at the end time now learn a parable of the fig tree when his branch is yet tender and put it forth leaves you know that summer is nigh all right you know all right you know that summer is nigh so likewise when ye shall see all these things now now brother Brown said all of these things means just that it means the ministry of the son of man it means the days that the society is going to become like it did in the days of Noah men's mind he will continue all over the world it's going to become like it did in lot's time with perversion and sexual perversions and perversions of every imaginable kind to where they even they even want to have illicit affairs with the angels you talking about The Audacity Of The Devil you're talking about the nastiness of the devil don't mess around with him teenagers he actually wants to do vile things to God's angels don't have nothing to do with him he'll corrupt your whole mind and pollute you and put scars in your life you'll you might never get away from this whole lifetime God give you Grace to keep going but you're going to be all wounded up I promise you when you get down the road and the baptism the Holy Ghost it never fails every believer turns back and says I wish I'd have served him sooner I wish I'd had this back there I wouldn't have went that way in that way and did this and that did that and all these scars and wounds I got but I didn't want to show you now but I wish I didn't have them I wish I'd have stayed true as a young man I wish I'd have just kept serving him and kept serving him Hallelujah thank God for keeping me from the things he did see so likewise he when you shall see all these things so it's all of these things and it's and and it's uh it's Israel putting forth its Leaf now we could go there and read that in the scripture uh but but it's in verse 32 here where we're reading right here now learn a parable of the fig tree that's Israel when its branch is yet tender and puteth forth leaves all right so that Nation the people the generation that sees that that generation is the one that won't pass away till everything in Matthew 24 is fulfilled and we've already read to the end of the tribulation now you got to do the math backwards the generation that sees Israel and sees the days of Noah and the days of lot that generation that sees that start counting because that's God's timepieces Israel see verily I say unto you this generation the one that sees it all will not pass till all things be fulfilled all the way to the sign of the son of man appearing in the earth Mourns all the way to Revelation 19. amen I'm here to tell you there was a generation that I already saw that come to pass say yet was us not exactly it was them I saw this little girl interviewed she's now in her 80s I saw her interviewed and she tells she she's that little girl right there with the square you can see I've got it right there and she tells of the Horrors friends she's now in her 80s and uh and all of those children are passing away I think we lose so many of them every single day and that's the generation that saw Israel put forth its leaf and that's the generation that won't completely can't completely pass from the earth until all the way to the end of the tribulation is observed I want to ask you a question today now are you concerned I hope you're convinced you know it's one thing to be convinced but then you're going to want to be concerned amen and that is that is a burden in my heart musicians return come back I realize I'm at a junction if I go further I'll need another 45 minutes that is the generation that is going to see these children who are elderly adults now saw the Horrors they literally you're looking in the faces of humans who saw the putting forth of the leaf they this is the generation that goes back to Palestine after their Liberation and that's where they raised the six-point star of David and have their own flag and their own money and brother Branham goes back and takes up the U.N security Council and all the vote now he got their own flag in their own Army and their own money and their own people their own government their own Constitution I'm here to tell you something friends this is the this is the hour this is the time this is the of all prophecy has come to pass in our day and you no now you wonder why now you shouldn't wonder anymore see um because you can take that down Maddie this this is as I've said to you before you are the generation upon whom the ends of the world have come you're it it can't go further there's not another age he only had seven stars in his right hand and he's already deployed all seven of them he's already deployed them and recalled them and the last remaining Ministry of son of man is in the bride right now are you convinced are you concerned are you concerned enough stand with me all over the building are you concerned enough right right by your heads I I didn't expect to end at this point today but I definitely am a letter of the holy spirit with all your heads bowed now and all your eyes closed everywhere now if you're convinced and you

alive on the Earth for there won't be a need to write history about there won't be anyone to read it I believe that we are the generation upon whom the ends of the world have come I commit all of
