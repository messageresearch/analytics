to Philippians chapter 1 amen I presume uh you got my PowerPoint to the booth amen excellent brother Josh amen we'll get this um scripture reading and then we'll go right to that hope by the help of the Lord just to Carry On from Sunday and I ran out of time but just felt that we stopped at the right place so want to pick up from there tonight got a number of prayer requests we'll get to just shortly amen uh verse chapter 1 verse one Philippians 1 and one Paul and timotheus the Servants of Jesus Christ to all the saints in Christ Jesus which are at Philippi with the Bishops and deacons Grace be unto you and peace from God our Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ I thank my God upon every remembrance of you always pray of mine for you all quest with joy for your fellowship in the gospel from the first day until now being confident of this very thing that he which hath begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ is that beautiful verse 20 according to my Earnest expectation and my hope that in nothing I shall be ashamed but that with all boldness as always so now also Christ shall be magnified in my body whether it be by life or by death for to me to live is Christ and to die well that's gain amen isn't that amazing praise the Lord let's pray father we thank you for your word tonight Lord and I just uh have desired to be standing here at this moment Lord to carry on in this material and I commit myself into your hands thoroughly Lord that you would take over and let me help me Lord to convey the burden of the word for the people that's on my heart tonight I commit it to you in Jesus name amen God bless bless your friends you can be seated all right we'll have the PowerPoint up there brother Josh amen Philippians 1:1 if you'll remember in our reading it was Paul and Timothy the Servants of Jesus Christ to all the the Saints in Christ Jesus so when you and I when you break down the original uh Greek language that means the set aside ones of Christ amen those who are set aside those who are different those who are not the world those who are not like the world Amen praise the Lord and so you know he that he that's who he's talking to Grace be unto you and peace from God our Father and you know it's interesting that this grace and peace he's not saying you know uh grace and grace and peace unto you from Wells Fargo bank because you got a lot of money in your bank Grace and peace unto you from Mark Zuckerberg because you got a lot of friends it's not what he's saying it's not Grace and peace from the White House I just want to make this point there's no Grace and peace except coming by Jesus Christ yes amen amen amen all right so Sunday we had read this this quote from an absolute and brother brandom I just want to read it again just for a refresher brother brandham said there was no profits in them days you remember how that we took the text out of the Old Testament where where there was no open Vision in the days of Samuel when he was just a boy in the days of Eli you remember that and it said the word of God was precious the word of the Lord was precious because it was rare now I I'll promise you this it's it was less rare then than it is now see right now we have a more sure word of Prophecy Amen in the word of God we have the Messiah we have his understanding we have the death burial and Resurrection We Now understand things the disciples did not understand at that even when Jesus was there right so we have when John come back from the aisle of patmas he had a further revelation of things that the church clearly had no understanding of before the Holy Ghost experience in the upper room and then Paul comes along and starts setting the church in order and then when John comes back everything he brings everybody is able to tie them together with what Paul has taught them to say goodness look at a revelation of Jesus Christ and here's his description and I'll be if that's not exactly what Paul described him as and then it goes in starts to describe the church that we are he hath made us Kings and Priests my goodness and the whole church is saying can you imagine that John would go to the aisle of patmas for two years and when he comes back the the one that spoke to him agreed with everything the messenger has already told us that's a beautiful thing friends that's why to me this message is so beautiful today because it's so agrees with everything I already knew in the Bible and then the things I didn't understand it all makes sense and ties all together I'm going to tell you something friends we today have a seven course meal now having said that in perfect contrast you have the prophecy that at the end time there would be a famine for hearing the word of God so not a famine of the word of God but a famine of hearing the word of God and you say well that doesn't make sense because this is the 21st century and we've got it digitized and it's going all over the world in every language and it's went to every country and it's on the internet and it's on it's on this site and that site and this site and that site and it's being spread everywhere how is there a famine for hearing the word there's a famine for people willing to hear the word so now it turns back again you are rare yes amen you now if you're rare then you know what that makes you precious in His sight because you you rare bunch of people you one in a million you have believed his word and that makes him love you and you are precious in His sight but the world has turned a deaf ear and the Bible said they would do that they would Heap to themselves teachers having itching ears they wouldn't want to hear the word of God anymore they they they the the people who don't listen to the word of God don't listen to it because they don't want to people who don't come to church don't come because they don't want to people who have left churches and stay at home on purpose and have S have have given up a local church and a local Ministry a local live pastor and they've stopped coming to church and stop fellowshipping with the Saints the reason they've done that is because that's what they wanted to do and somebody told them it was okay and they took it but I still believe what Paul said that as you see the day approaching you ought to assemble more Let Your Love abound abound amen this is the time where love must abound Faith must abound now if that's true do we believe it do we accept it then then then don't hold it against God if he has to take measures to make sure that you're growing along at pace so we finished Sunday well we didn't finish it but we read this quote in part one he says there was no Prophets in them days to stand to the word and direct Israel so the word wasn't coming so every man did what was right in his own sight and that's about what we where we've gotten to to uh to again today Brethren see every man in his own sight see uh well I want to take the Golden Rule I want to do this you know some religion I believe my religion uh is do so and so and you find that everybody finds that God's he says now God's Got Away amen amen now you'd have confidence in it if God's got it right the B but the Bible also says there is a way now this is obviously another way there is a way that Seth right unto a man but the end thereof is the way of death and there's nobody wants to die that's separation we don't want to be separated from God we want to live life is the greatest treasure that man can have and now we've got to find what is life and he said he's going to answer question his own question my word is life that's the life that you should have the word living in you so we talked about the problem now we are coming to the book of Philippians because we don't just need a problem we need an answer amen all right so when we look here in Philippians in our very oops in our very first verse we find I Paul and Timothy the Servants of Jesus Christ to all the saints in Christ Jesus now this these this wording here uh let let me read it to you like this with some help from the Amplified Bible Paul and Timothy the servants the attendants the helpers of Jesus Christ in his ministry you know to all the saints the all the set aside ones the word has very little effect on people who are not willing to be set aside for service but I just want to say to you tonight please don't allow uh any type of resentment or anger or offense or bitterness rise in your hearts at the preaching of the gospel because we're only his helpers please when you think of brother Jason just remember and if what I say offends you just say well he's just the Lord's helper I'm not here I've never been here I've never used this desk you know to try to to try to dominate over people it's not about that it's that's that's the need Deeds of the nicians and the Lord hates that and I hate it and you hate it and we hate it amen amen so we are the Servants of the lord we are his attendants we are his helpers where we read on down we find in verse four or let's get verse three a going into four I thank my God upon every remembrance of you always in every prayer of mine for you all making requests with joy now that Paul can do anything with joy is astonishing I mean you know people who get feeling sorry for themselves just remember that Paul talks about and he says you know I've I've been robbed of my countrymen beaten many times many stripes twice he said I had the 40 Lashes save one the same one Jesus had Paul had twice he's been he said I've been robbed I've been hungry I've been naked I've been he said I spent a day and a night in the Deep because we were 14 days in a ship in a gale and we even despaired of life and then the ship was crashed and I spent a night and a day in the Deep I even despaired of Life yes amen so you know here's Paul he's rejected he's in prisoned he gets out he's put back he you know he's he's he's Chained and and and and he's he's a he's constantly stoned and he's been stoned numerous times and and left for dead so you know if you break a spiritual fingernail get over it if you stop your spiritual toe just get over it amen because here is Paul saying you know after everything he's been through I pray for you I pray the prayer of mind for you all making requests with joy he's not even saying I request Joy or or I request for you Joy he said I request with joy amen so the fact that Paul can do anything with joy and in fact is as he goes on down in that chapter it's going to be more and and more astonishing with what he says over the next number of verses however by the time hopefully we get to verse 20 and 21 the end of our opening text uh you're going to see the secret to it all amen you want a secret Lord they they say that if you want somebody's undivided attention laser focus you lean in and Whisper I shouldn't be telling you this I promise you they will drop everything they will lay their phone down so I'm going to we're going to get to Paul's secret that how that in everything he could still have joy when we come to verse S even as it is meat for me or good for me to think this of you all because I have you in my heart in as much as both in my bonds and in the defense and confirmation of the Gospel look what I've got to underline ye all are partakers of my grace in other words he's saying to the church you share in my afflictions you share in my hardships you share in my bonds and guess what it's all partaking of Grace so I just want to encourage you here on a Wednesday night I know there's all kinds of buns and there's all kinds of hardships and there's all kinds of afflictions but there's joy because there's Grace and I'm just more than happy to say I will take my stand with the Lord's despise few Peter Peter talks about this in First Peter chapter 1 verses 3-7 and he says blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ which according to His abundant uh excuse me yeah according to His abundant Mercy hath begotten us again unto a life ly Hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead so now I want you to realize that we have been begotten again unto a lively hope not a lively dread not a lively depression there's no such thing see we have we have been given he goes on to say watch this to an inheritance incorrupt able and undefiled and I will say to you quite undefiled not a way reserved in heaven for you for you who are kept by the power of God through faith un salvation ready to be revealed in the last time I mean friends I don't know of a better package deal that you could be a partaker of tonight you have an inheritance Incorruptible enough undefiled and one that fadeth not away so it'll be it'll be good tomorrow good the next day regardless of what happens it'll get you home it fadeth not away say but what happens down here in Earth it's reserved in heaven Hallelujah and you are kept by the power of God I don't know if I can make it listen you are kept by the power of God through faith under salvation ready to be revealed in the last time I don't feel so much it's not about you it's what he has done it's what the devil don't want you to believe but it's the truth and therefore he says wherein we greatly Rejoice how many are rejoicing in that do you love the fact that it's incorruptable do you love the fact that it's reserved in heaven is that a rejoicing does that make it precious you realize it's reserved in heaven and the power of God is bringing to pass are you rejoicing how many are rejoicing are you sure are you sure okay don't don't stop rejoicing don't don't stop rejoicing though now for a season if need ye are in heaviness through manifold Temptations come on what happened what y'all said you were ready you said you were rejo I knew you would do this let me take it away all right Rejoice all [Applause] [Laughter] right oh wait a minute minute brother Simon hold on man wait what what happened all this inheritance reserved in heaven the power of God you know wow why why would I need why what in the world are you kidding do do you understand Peter that you're talking to those with an Incorruptible inheritance undefiled and faith not away and it's reserved for me in heaven you mean if need be what are you talking about if need be I'm kept by the power of God God through faith un salvation ready to be revealed what's this kind of language if need be ye are in heaviness to manifold Temptations good question that the trial of your faith being much more precious than of gold that perisheth though it be tried with fire everybody say fire that's right though it be tried what what's getting tried my faith I thought I had an inheritance Incorruptible you still got to have the trial of fire it's a trial of your faith and it's not bad it's good Rejoice you'd Rejoice if I handed out bars of gold if I walk down through here with 24 Karat bars of gold and handed everybody a couple of pounds each they would hear you in Port Royal and all the way down on Boundary Street you'd be rejoicing and singing and kicking it up and I'm here to tell you that the trial of your faith is much more precious than gold that perisheth if you're willing to go through it you'll have a faith that won't perish though it be tried with fire okay that here's why that you might be found unto the praise how many want it and honor how many want it and Glory how many wanted at the appearing of Jesus Christ [Music] amen so it's something that's slightly more precious it's much more the next time you're in a trial please don't whine and cry and complain and call nine people and put it on Facebook for the whole world to cry along with you rejoice because it's much more precious than gold amen gold perishes that's right do you know that Armageddon is going to destroy everybody's gold good news you get to come back I can claim it Rejoice oh my we found out the other service that sons of Zion are more valuable than gold that lovely so Paul I'm sorry Peter carrying on in Peter we're coming to verse nine now this is the whis translation with a little bit of uh little bit of little bit of flavor that I've added to it of my own just I'm just adding it for clarity but this is largely I want to give credit where credits to this is largely from the whis translation very wonderful translation brother JD's father-in-law uh turned me on to verse nine my Earnest prayer this is Peter for the church my Earnest prayer namely is that your love divine in its nature might more and more overflow amen see but at the same time being kept within the guiding limitations of God's word that's directly from the Weis let's look at it again here's my Earnest prayer Peter is saying this is the same guy who's let you know you're going to get Fiery trials they're they're more precious than gold you should Rejoice see my Earnest prayer namely is that your love divine in its nature so it's not human remember it's not a love for God it's the love of God amen right that your love divine in its nature might more and more so it sounds like trials and things to perfect you're going to keep coming and keep coming one yeah I got one yeah Rejoice see here's why so that your love divine in its nature might more and more overflow love isn't a whole lot of value if it's not active you know brother Steve wrote the song The Lazy Light Keeper the light was burning bright within but it it wasn't reaching out sit on the lens a lot of good it did to have light inside it couldn't reach out and didn't save the captain see so that your love more and more overflow but at the same time be kept within the guiding limitations of God's word remember in that this guiding knowledge was ministered to you by the Holy Spirit there's lots of ministering spirits in the world there's one holy spirit so which one do you want to be ministered to there's a there's millions of spirits to anoint you and Lead You and influence you and inform your thinking but there's one Holy Spirit and it's the love of God and it's divine in its nature see and you're but but but it's not you know it's it's uh he says here let me see if I want to go to the next one yeah so so he's he's bringing this here uh let me get to where I want to be so that your love divine in its nature uh Eugene Peterson in his message translation of the New Testament he says so that your love not sentimental gush see not sentimental gush you still have to identify and call Sin Sin and that ain't that don't that don't mean you go on a street corner and do it and it don't mean that you you just you know you you you get in everybody's business it's just your life becomes a sermon amen You Want To Lose Friends fast get in everybody's life and judge them and tell them what to do and how to live believe me you lose friends I know by experience so don't do that love one another pray for one another sometimes opinions however good they might be are Best Kept to yourself and you wonder why people don't like you so much that there's a reason for that amen so whoever that helps praise the Lord might be somebody online amen amen it was free Amen brother Luther amen that wasn't in my notes but not sentimental gush just live your life let your light so shine That Others May see it was remember friends it is the lighthouse on the on the hill but it's the Lower Lights it's the Lower Lights because that's where many a shipwreck has happened that even when the lighthouse was shining a big beam because the the channel was narrow and shallows they had men that go down along the bank with Lower Lights that's why the song let the Lower Lights be burning send a beam across the way that some poor wayfaring seman you may rescue you may save sister Jean used to sing that in younger days my looking forward to hear singing it again so my Earnest prayer namely is that your love divine and it nature might more and more overflow but at the same time be kept within the guiding limitations of God's word remembering that this guiding knowledge was ministered to you by the Holy Spirit you cannot help anyone by letting down the bars and doing it in the Name of Love that's not love that's at least that's not Divine love that might be sentimental gush and you might be sentimentally gushing on on everybody that really needs to see a a life of a Christian out of you and it would do them a whole lot better than you just gushing all the time and just trying to be you know just just never never living in a way never having anything in your life that confronts the world and makes them think and second guess that maybe they need more than they have see brother brandham when he talks about the sman age and um brother Brenham said you know he's covering Revelation tribulation brother brandham says now the Lord God Almighty says I know there he is walking in the midst of his people there he is the chief Shepherd of the flock but does he hold back the persecution does he stem the tribulation no he does not he simply says I know your tribulation I'm not at all unmindful of your suffering just remember that friends when it feels like you you're suffering you can't get a prayer to go higher than your 9- foot ceiling just remember he's not unmindful at all he's aware what a stumbling block that is to so many people m yes amen like Israel they wondered if God really loves them how can God be just and loving if he stands by and watches his people suffer this is what they ask him in Malachi 1 the burden of the word of the lord of the Lord to Israel by Malachi I have loved you sayith the Lord yet you say wait wherein hast thou loved us now if you go back and you read that in Malachi he go they're they're asking the Lord look you don't you know we're suffering do you understand that you understand that we're a nation we're under conflict we're under military rule we got all these things going on and you say you love us and yet we've been invaded and everything and the Lord doesn't deny any of that in fact is he's the one who hired pharaoh to come in after him he's the one who hired uh Nebuchadnezzar he's the one who hired all these Kings and all their armies to go in and spank his children he doesn't he doesn't try to disavow himself of that see but he simply you know what you know what he you know how he proves he says you say wherein hast thou loved us and he says really was was not Jacob and Esau and yet I said before either were ever born that that Jacob have I loved and Esau have I hated am so God's love is proven in election in that he elected you see so so he he go he goes on brother brandham says you see they could not figure out God's love they thought that love meant no suffering they thought that love meant a baby with parental care but God said that he his love was elective love amen so this isn't sentimental gush like you would gush over a baby or like you would never have any kind of a thing that you don't want to offend you know you're you're the only light your family might see you're the only light your neighbors might see you're the only light your business associates might see but but we we don't want to offend anybody so all we do is just gush human gushing sentiment but I'm here to tell you something friends the love of God the real love of God is given by the Holy Spirit and and and so it comes down and that's why we kept asking you Sunday you know is this word precious amen the Eugene Peterson says verse n like this so this is my prayer that your love will flourish and that you will not only love much but love well learn to love appropriately so we're learning something tonight aren't we it's not the care it's not the care of a baby it's not that's not the kind of love he's talking about it's it's elective love it's a holy love it's a it's a divine nature love Jesus was loving the people just as much when he platted a whip together and ran them out of the Temple Le and whipped them and over overturned their money tables he loved them just as much doing that as he did when he was raising their dead just as much as when he was had a Social Services Program going and was feeding the poor he loved them just as much see and so they couldn't figure out God's love but he Peterson says so this is my prayer that your love will flourish and that you will not only love much but love well learn to love appropriately coming back to the whis translation for verse 10 so that going forward so in other words in other words Your Love needs to be appropriate are we rejoicing Your Love needs to be appropriate so that going forward by God's word you recognize you identify and you manifest the value of divine distinctions in true Christian conduct so that you might be unadulterated by evil and thus pure and not a stumbling block till the coming of the Lord this is what Peter's his his sermon is trying to get us to understand sometimes we go through Tri s sometimes they're fiery they're more precious than gold they sometimes we're suffering but just like Paul said even in Paul all of his suffering Paul prayed with joy the the recommendation of the Bible is that we Rejoice even if right now we have to go through something to perfect us even if I got to go through something hard that makes me more valuable than gold that perisheth that that because it's molding my divine nature it's teach teaching me to love appropriately I mean it's making you a super weapon for the law for God to use for your family don't resist it it's the best medicine your lost loved ones can ever encounter is you having come through the school of trial and tribulation and yet you loved God and you kept going and you became more precious than gold that perishes so that going forward by God's word I love that this is a bunch of stuff you recognize you identify and you manifest the value of divine distinctions I'm glad this is this is coming out of the Bible this isn't me to St here saying you need to be different than the world th this flies in in the face of modern Christianity who just says it doesn't matter and we're all alike we're not oh it doesn't matter oh it matters people are going to find out on Resurrection morning how much it matters they're going to find out at the day of judgment when they're in the tribulation they're going to find out wow I guess it mattered don't wait till then and guess it mattered understand now it matters that and thus pure and not a stumbling block till the coming of the Lord you know I think about the kind of love that hady Wright had for her children and we you know we went into this a little bit on Sunday and and I could I could I could feel things tightening up and people getting a little quiet because this gets down really close to where we live but to Haddie there was nothing more precious to her the greatest most precious desire of her heart was the salvation of her children she didn't have any money but that wasn't precious money wasn't precious to her she had sick family but and while she cared about them she certainly cared about them she certainly could have used money she certainly would love to see Edith be healed yeah her sister but you know what here's the thing Edith would die again anyway and then Haddie would die then what do you got so you've chased the world so you won the prize Well then what oh friends this love is divine Let Your Love be pure let it be let it be controlled by the Holy Ghost let it be appropriate see had he cared enough to live the kind of life in front of her boys and when she got the opportunity to have anything she wanted the most precious desire that God recognized and did the supernatural for was the love of a mother for her her unredeemed children I want to tell you something friends let every mother have that kind of faith today oh near and far because that's the thing that that God loved that because that's how he had been Hallelujah he spared no expense to save you and I right and so a lot of times it comes down to and hear me when I say I'm I'm I'm I'm gonna stop I'm trying to watch my time but listen let me let me come to this real um this point that I want to make sure we're not missing because it comes down to what is precious to you and a lot of times we find that the the problem can be is that the things that ought to be precious are valuable but they're not the most precious sometimes the example that parents ref they refuse to live that fervent life before their children and and and you know why they don't do that and it's not because they don't love their children it's because they love what they want to do more gold to my ear was the fourth prime minister of Israel she served from 1969 to 1974 in a speech one time uh before it was a journalist um journalist dinner and they had her there as a guest keynote speaker she started talking about the Arab Israeli conflict she made this gripping gripping gripping statement she's quite famous for it she says we can forgive the Arabs for killing our children we cannot forgive them for forcing us to kill their children we will only have peace with the Arabs when they love their children more than they hate us that's that takes my breath away what a statement look at it again we can forgive the Arabs for killing our children we cannot forgive them for forcing us to kill their children we will only have peace with the Arabs when they love their children more than they hate us so this kind of statement challenges us it challenges us tonight it was challenging us Sunday and it challenges us tonight to think about the root causes of and and the consequences of our actions and choices and consequence quences that that don't always turn out very good I made I made a mention of it Sunday and I didn't go on to it because I didn't want to get sidetracked into this material but you know I coming up on 30 years pastoring here I'm in my fifth or sixth I counted up the other day I think I'm in my sixth generation of young people growing up I've got an intermediate age on uh 12 13 14 who are growing heading toward that becoming that senior I know the age limits I'm not talking about that I'm talking about where you really are part where you really are a senior youth where you're headed to that 16 17 18 19 I'm going to tell you Mom and Dad if you haven't really really instilled a fervent love of God in the hearts of those children it's going to be very difficult to do once they get much older and I have stood in this pull pit and other buildings that we had before we had this building in 1999 stood in an aame that's no longer even there stood in a pull pit in Chessie standing in this pull pit for all these decades and I have and I have said to parents I know they look little and sweet and cute now and they're adorable and we love them but if you don't train them up in the way that they ought to go say brother Jason you're going to Hur the fing the some I can't help that because this has been a consistent message that I've given over and over again and I got now younger parents going to be having children and I got younger parents with little bitty children now and I know I've said it to every generation so I got to say it to this generation now listen I know they're sweet and cuddly now but they won't stay that way because you got to recognize they have a little sweet adorable Fallen nature and they're adorable now but if you don't bring listen you can't save them but what you can do is train them up the Bible doesn't say raise kids it says train them that's harder raising is just you you feed them you clothe them you shelter them you take them to school you take them to soccer you do do all that stuff that's not training that you're raising children but the Bible says train up a child and the reason I'm preaching this again for the sixth generation is I don't want to come to another generation of 16 17 18 19 20 year olds and they're out in the world or their life is filled with carnality that's not what the message came for and it's you say oh my goodness mine are already that age is it too late thank God no as long as Christ is still on the throne oh I'm here to tell you something friends God still honors Faith you can turn things around if you start today and it doesn't have to take you that long because the Jesus multiplies oh I used to say that a lot back in the day I haven't said it in a long time listen if he only added and subtracted then if you spent 20 years serving the devil Jesus would need 20 years to get you cleaned up fortunately he multip supplies and he can take 10 years 20 years 30 years of upside down life and in a moment turn it around I'm here to tell you something friends I was talking to a brother recently and I said listen when you get a body change that's not the first time something will happen to you in a moment in the twinkling of an eye it also happens at a new birth in a moment in the twinkling of an eye you are born again the body is only continuing the process process amen it challenges us to think about the consequences of our actions and the root causes and the root causes there's really only one at the root there's really only one singular cause at the heart of it and Jesus pins it on this trying to serve God and yet love the things of the world at the same time and he makes it clear that you cannot do both at the same time those things are mutually exclusive they those two things cannot both be true about you there are things that are not mut mutually exclusive and they both things can actually be true at the same time this ain't one of them either you love one and ha and hate the other or love this one and hate this one amen you can't serve God in the world it's impossible and so you know they we we find you know because where if you want if you want consequences if you want to make it plural now you can get into into plural by the many bad outcomes and the devastating consequences plural devastating consequences devastating consequences for near and dear ones around you your own children your own family members your own close friends when you love the when you when you love them more when you love your children and your family and your close friends when you love remember go to my ear see look at it again we can forgive the Arabs for killing our children we cannot forgive them for forcing us to kill their children we will only have peace with the Arabs when they love their children more then they hate us and when you find that you can love your family and your children and your close friends and you love them more than you love following your own carnal desires wow that's when you will see the love of God come Sweeping in with the supernatural to accomplish The Impossible or as Paul calls it in Philippians 1:11 being filled with the fruits of righteousness I want my family filled with the fruits of righteousness I want my friends filled with the fruits of righteousness I want my whole all my near kin filled with the fruits of right I want this church I want your family I want your children filled with the fruits of righteousness which are by Jesus Christ under the glory and praise of God I want the Lord to fill them so full of the Holy Ghost and give them eternal life that their lives bring glory to God that they make Heaven their home who could not want that for their dearest loved ones who could possibly want their own carnal desires more than they love their children and their family and they know that there will be conse quences and and and regrets and things like that that happen oh friends I'm not here to I'm not going to close and leave you on a down note I'm here to tell you that there's hope in Christ and he can turn it around overnight he can turn it around immediately he can turn it around tonight in this service you don't even have to leave here the way you came here you can say Lord tonight I'm making a determination I'm going to love you more than I love myself I'm going to love my family more than I love my carnal design desires as Peter says I put Peter but it's actually Paul we're back to Philippians this is actually Philippians 1:20 my apologies according to my Earnest expectation and my hope that in nothing I shall be ashamed but that with all boldness as always so now also Christ shall be magnified in my body whether it be by life or by death Eugene Peterson writes that 20th verse like this in his in his message translation of the Bible I don't expect to be embarrassed in the least on the contrary everything to me in in this jail only serves to make Christ more accurately known regardless of whether I live or die they didn't shut me up they gave me a platform alive I'm Christ's messenger dead I'm his prize life versus even more life I can't lose hallelujah what do you want tonight I want life plus more life Hallelujah I can't lose it doesn't matter life or death it doesn't matter you know why it doesn't matter because for me to live is Christ and to die is G that's what's precious to me friends is that what's precious to you are you ready to Rejoice tonight with what is precious and say Lord I want your word to be precious in my sight I want your life I want the value I want a I don't want a gushy sentim s sentimental gush I want to have a divine nature in my love I want to learn to love but I want to learn to love well I want to learn to love appropriately amen friends that's what I desire Christ gives me meaning to life and cause his people to serve him my even even to their death it I mean imagine that you have the ability to call somebody to serve God until the day they die amen and the way you done it was you were willing to die and then be reborn and then shine a light that wasn't hindered by carnal soot on your life the light projected it wasn't sentimental gush it was a propriate Divine in nature it rejoices in Trials it endures hardships it counts it all joy when fiery Trials come it knows that it's being perfected to something more valuable than gold amen that's what's worth rejoicing friends that's what I want to Rejoice over that that's what's precious so I come back tonight and I I come to the end of this again and I ask the question what is more precious to you what is the most precious thing to you I can tell you something friends if it's not this if you don't value this above your own daily bread and the air in your lungs then I I I feel sorry for you tonight let me tell you I'm a man who if the Lord said if the Lord said you've got a couple of breaths left what are you going to do with them I'd say Lord if I only got a few breaths left with my last one please tell me when I'm taking my last one because my last breath I want to declare Satan is a liar and that Jesus Christ is the truth that's the last thing I want to hear want the world hear me say Satan is a liar my last let me just say it again and again Satan's a liar Satan's a liar I don't care What's happen he's a liar I'm here to tell you Jesus is truth hallelujah the word is truth and there's liberty and there's power in prayer Power in the Blood amen and I believe that with all my heart amen let's stand to our feet friends amen praise the Lord I've been amen real disciplined on Wednesday nights y'all bound to love me y'all going to want me to preach

majesty that that's how I do it when I go when I go overseas and I've been many many times I hate being away from my family I hate being away from my home I hate being away and when I had children it was I hated being away from my kids and uh and it's not easy a real real trip like that is not easy there's Brothers here also who know that by experience amen I think of the trips Brother Brad has

trips are demanding now I'm reading this so you'll help me pray for them not okay that's why I'm reading it right these trips are demanding and indeed no picnic but the kingdom and the King's business requires haste that's what David said the king's business requires Haste The Kingdom and The King's business requires haste and often sever it you're officially and unequivocally on duty you're working for the king no time for pleasure or pandering cut the head off of the devil everywhere you go and take every Spirit of the enemy under your control through the Holy Ghost how many will pray that that'll be the effect of our brothers offer him no quarter except no surrender or treaty he must be destroyed in the lives of God's family as sister Mr Brenda Lewis wrote You've been given full Authority and Power in his name the greatest mission of any church is to go or send someone I sent them this quote from Thomas Jackson Stonewall Jackson he says War means fighting the business of the soldier is to fight armies are not called out to dig trenches to throw up breastworks to live in camps but to find the enemy and strike him to invade his country and do him all possible damage in the shortest possible time this will involve Great destruction of life and property while it lasts but such a war will of necessity be of brief continuance and so would be an economy of life and property in the End Amen I just wanted to send them with courage you know when we say take the name of Jesus with you that means something brother brandom said the rod that Moses had was the name of Jesus to you and I he said he said they the Egyptians they never they never caught that he kept doing everything with that rod and no one ever thought to take it from him brother Bram said brother BR said brother Bram said if they could have got that Rod out of his hands they'd have had him whipped I'm glad I ain't holding just a natural Rod that somebody could trip and take from me I'm holding the name of Jesus and nobody can take take that from me amen praise the Lord I had also a request from sister Sharon Carter prayer requests for safe travels for me tomorrow I'm flying to Alabama for the
