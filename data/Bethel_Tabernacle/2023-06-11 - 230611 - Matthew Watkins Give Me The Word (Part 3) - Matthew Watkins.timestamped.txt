[22:19] testimony I went Friday just as an
[22:21] update

[22:25] weeks to The Specialist and
[22:28] she said on every measurable metric I'm
[22:31] improving amen she was very happy and
[22:34] all of the different things she was
[22:37] seeing are all seemed to be gone the the
[22:40] virus is gone and uh just healing up the
[22:43] effects of it amen I'm thankful to God
[22:45] and she took back some of the medication
[22:48] I'm I'm putting in my eye cutting a lot
[22:51] of it cut in half and some of it even
[22:53] more she said another week or so I can
[22:55] fade off of most of it she doesn't even
[22:57] want to see me again for almost five or
[22:59] six weeks amen so I'm thanking the Lord
[23:01] this morning amen praise God
[23:06] it's not easy and um she asked me she
[23:10] asked me if I was preaching so so I had
[23:13] to kind of tell her I wasn't and she
[23:15] continued to ask me not to do that and I
[23:19] don't know if she got tipped off or if
[23:21] she went online but I think she knows
[23:22] that I get a little excited so you said
[23:26] you have to you're going to have to just
[23:28] tough it out because and I thought well
[23:30] you don't have any idea you're not a
[23:31] preacher it's tougher than you think and
[23:34] so um but she said it can actually cause
[23:36] it to come back again but I'm just I'm
[23:39] saying that's not part of the program by
[23:41] his stripes I am already healed amen so
[23:45] I'm thanking the lord for that I'm
[23:46] looking forward to getting back in the
[23:48] Pulpit on the first of July I'm gonna
[23:51] have to stay on the sidelines through

[24:23] it up and tough it out and um but um
[24:27] you keep saying she said I'm like you

[28:03] keep knocking and then say Lord would

[28:09] announcements uh one uh is concerning
[28:13] Youth Camp and this isn't this is just
[28:15] uh to uh just a brief announcement
[28:18] there'll be more announcements
[28:20] coming from Brother Jason to Mars and
[28:23] and myself just as we get closer and
[28:25] closer but just a couple things I just
[28:28] want to keep it on your mind Amen to the
[28:30] church those that are here I know that
[28:32] we have a lot of people out today
[28:34] traveling and so we want to make sure
[28:36] this just gets said to the whole church
[28:39] but Youth Camp is coming up as we know
[28:42] registration is opening on October 19th
[28:44] and so October I'm sorry June forgive me
[28:48] the word corrects the air
[28:51] amen correct the air and make sure if
[28:53] anybody if I say anything right now just
[28:55] please correct me uh June chapter uh
[28:58] June June
[29:00] chapter and verse
[29:02] I need to get to my thought but I need
[29:04] to make these announcements too
[29:06] uh June 19th we have registration
[29:09] opening and so we want to just put that
[29:12] as a reminder because our young people
[29:15] this is your opportunity as our youth
[29:17] group here to register uh to get online
[29:20] and register and so there's some that
[29:22] have
[29:23] want to register don't have the funds
[29:25] today uh and don't have the funds by the
[29:29] 19th and so we want to just make make
[29:32] you aware that if that's your case and
[29:34] you need to register but you won't have
[29:36] the the funds by the 19th then just let
[29:38] us know that come to us and let us know
[29:41] that you can't some already have and we
[29:43] will hold your place and give you an
[29:45] extension on that if you need a little
[29:47] bit more time we can't do that very far
[29:49] and take that too far but we do we would
[29:51] do we do want to make sure all of our
[29:53] young people have the opportunity to
[29:55] register and to go and so if you don't
[29:58] and Camp gets full as we said the last
[30:01] two years we can't let you in we can't
[30:03] give you a spot there's only so many
[30:06] beds so if you miss your opportunity
[30:08] this is Mercy so don't spurn Mercy
[30:11] there's only judgment after you spurn
[30:13] Mercy this is warning before judgment so
[30:16] make sure you get registered also
[30:19] we need a as we've told you before
[30:22] there's a work crew that is necessary
[30:25] very much necessary of 40 people is that
[30:29] right
[30:29] 45 people
[30:32] to work in the kitchen and and your the
[30:36] fee for that is
[30:39] 99 I believe
[30:42] I should have had my notes here for that
[30:43] but the fee for that covers your lodging
[30:45] covers your Mills also but as our church
[30:49] we're reaching out to other churches
[30:50] other believers to make that known that
[30:53] we do need a work crew we have to have
[30:55] it actually it's not a it's a
[30:56] requirement for uh Carolina point for
[30:59] the camp so if it's on your heart to
[31:01] help this year and you think that you
[31:03] could come and serve in that capacity
[31:04] brother Jason will be making more
[31:06] announcements specifically we'll send
[31:08] something out to the church on exactly
[31:09] what the requirements are and what we
[31:11] need but I just want to make a plea for
[31:14] that today that we really do need our
[31:17] church before other churches to step up
[31:19] and uh and and help it's a it's a it's a
[31:22] it's a great help it's a labor of love
[31:24] and sacrifice to the young people but we
[31:26] do need those roles filled and so we'll
[31:28] announce more
[31:30] um more of that so I would say quite
[31:33] simply if you have a desire to come and
[31:35] help and many over the last two years
[31:37] have came to us and said I'd like to
[31:39] help it with youth camp well now's your
[31:41] opportunity now's your chance to do that
[31:43] we have spots for you to fulfill and so
[31:46] if you're wanting to do that the
[31:49] registration deadline for that is uh
[31:52] August 1st I believe is what we've said
[31:54] and so uh those are my announcements I
[31:57] don't have anything else here you love
[31:59] the Lord Jesus amen we just wanted to
[32:01] put that before you to make sure you're
[32:04] aware of that we're coming up on that
[32:05] date June 11th today so just uh just a
[32:08] few days away uh from that Ezekiel
[32:12] chapter two if you have your Bible we'll
[32:15] just begin reading here
[32:18] we want to just continue on with our
[32:20] thought that we took last Sunday give me
[32:22] the word and this will be part three
[32:27] and he said unto me son of man
[32:30] stand upon thy feet and I will speak
[32:33] unto thee
[32:34] and the spirit entered me when he spoke
[32:37] unto me and set me upon my feet that I
[32:40] heard him that spake unto me and he said
[32:44] unto me son of man I send thee to
[32:46] children of Israel to a rebellious
[32:49] nation that hath rebelled against me
[32:51] they and their fathers have turned
[32:52] grassed against me even unto this very
[32:55] day for they are impudent children and
[32:57] stiff-hearted I do send thee unto them
[33:01] and thou shalt say unto them thus saith
[33:04] the Lord God and they whether they will
[33:07] hear or whether they will forbear for
[33:09] their rebellious house yet shalt know
[33:12] that there hath been a prophet among
[33:15] them and now son of man be not afraid of
[33:18] them neither be afraid of their words
[33:21] though Briars and Thorns be with thee
[33:25] and thou doest dwell among scorpions be
[33:29] not afraid of their words nor be
[33:32] dismayed at their looks though they be a
[33:35] rebellious house do you think this is a
[33:38] good description
[33:39] of the world we live in today
[33:43] we dwell amongst scorpions he says
[33:47] Thorns be with thee yet I'm going to
[33:50] give you a thus saith the Lord not
[33:52] something from you not your own figuring
[33:55] it out I'm going to give you a sure word
[33:57] of Prophecy I'm going to give you I'm
[33:59] going to put my words inside of you not
[34:02] your own words Ezekiel this is going to
[34:03] be the word from the Lord thou shall
[34:06] speak verse 7 Thou shalt speak my words
[34:10] unto them whether they will hear or
[34:13] whether they will forbear for they are
[34:15] most rebellious but thou son of man hear
[34:20] what I say unto thee be not thou
[34:22] rebellious like that rebellious house
[34:25] open thy mouth and eat now this is an
[34:29] important verse here we're going to draw
[34:30] a text from open thy mouth and eat that
[34:35] I give thee and when I looked Behold a
[34:39] hand was sent unto me and lo a roll of a
[34:42] book was therein and he spread it before
[34:45] me and it was written within and without
[34:47] and there was written there Lamentations
[34:49] and mourning and whoa Revelations if you
[34:52] have your Bible chapter 5 just before
[34:54] you're seated we just want to cover yet
[34:57] one more scripture here
[34:59] and I saw in the right hand of him that
[35:01] sat on the throne of book written within
[35:03] and on the backside sealed with Seven
[35:06] Seals and I saw a strong angel
[35:09] proclaiming with a loud voice who is
[35:12] worthy to open the book and to loose the
[35:15] seals thereof and no man in Heaven Nor
[35:18] in Earth neither under the Earth was
[35:20] able to open the book neither to look
[35:22] thereon and I went much because no man
[35:25] was found worthy to open and to read the
[35:28] book neither to look thereon and then
[35:30] one of the elders saith unto me weep not
[35:32] Behold The Lion of the tribe of Judah
[35:35] the root of David hath prevailed to open
[35:38] the book and to loose the Seven Seals
[35:41] thereof and behold and lo in the midst
[35:44] of the throne and of the the four beasts
[35:46] and in the midst of the Elder stood a
[35:48] lamb as it had been slain having seven
[35:50] horns and seven eyes which are the seven
[35:53] spirits of God sent forth into all the
[35:56] Earth and he came and took the book out
[35:59] of the the right hand of him that set
[36:01] upon the throne and when he had taken
[36:03] the book The Four beasts and four twenty
[36:06] Elders fell down before the lamb having
[36:08] every one of them Harps and golden vials
[36:10] of full of odors which are the prayers
[36:12] of the Saints and they sang a new song
[36:16] saying Thou Art Worthy to take the book
[36:18] isn't it awesome when the Lord changes
[36:20] the song and the tempo changes and the
[36:23] atmosphere changes and there's there's
[36:25] the atmosphere of gloom and despair and
[36:27] doom but let me just preach here for a
[36:29] minute while you're standing we're not
[36:31] under the Rhythm and tempo of gloom and
[36:34] doom and despair this is the tempo of
[36:37] Onward Christian Soldiers the lamb hath
[36:40] prevailed Hallelujah and he says they
[36:43] sang a new song saying Thou Art Worthy
[36:45] to take the book and to open the Sills
[36:47] thereof for thou was slain and has
[36:51] redeemed us to God by the blood of out
[36:53] of every by thy blood out of every
[36:55] Kindred and tongue and people and Nation
[36:58] Lord we give you thanks this morning we
[37:01] Rejoice Lord for we've got something to
[37:04] Rejoice about we've got something Lord
[37:07] that you've revealed unto us Lord in
[37:09] this end time day of Darkness Lord day
[37:12] of Gloom day of Despair but Lord to the
[37:16] bride arise Shine for thy light has come
[37:19] we give you thanks this morning Lord we
[37:22] pray God that you would come Lord as
[37:24] you've been so faithful to do as we
[37:26] stand here Lord God in great need of you
[37:28] this morning Lord as we've said many
[37:30] times every Mo every time Lord I come to
[37:34] this spot Lord where I've read my
[37:36] scripture and I'm about to minister what
[37:38] you've laid Upon My Heart Lord I can't
[37:40] help father but just before you
[37:44] Lord to stand here and say who am I Lord
[37:47] God that I would be here behind this
[37:50] desk Lord speaking to your people father
[37:52] but all of us Lord truly feel that way
[37:54] who are we lord to be called your
[37:56] children what Grace this is Lord we
[37:59] humble ourselves now to you Lord to what
[38:02] you're wanting to do we yield our vessel
[38:04] may God you just come and take your word
[38:07] break it Lord to your children we ask it
[38:10] in Jesus Christ's name
[38:12] amen you could be
[38:14] I knew maybe three weeks ago maybe two
[38:17] two and a half weeks ago that I would
[38:19] preach this sermon today the Lord just
[38:22] in a special way uh told me that and so
[38:26] I know that the Lord has something very
[38:29] specific and the Lord didn't want me to
[38:31] preach it last Sunday he wanted me to
[38:33] preach it today so you just believe that
[38:35] God can use a vessel God can use a man
[38:38] and God's timing is always just right on
[38:41] time
[38:42] and so the Lord Lord I just have great
[38:44] confidence in that that what we're going
[38:46] to speak up today I'm just going to
[38:48] relax amen and yield my vessel and to
[38:51] say exactly what the Holy Spirit wants
[38:53] me to say and I don't want to say
[38:56] anything that he wouldn't want me to say
[38:58] I just want to be obedient to him this
[38:59] morning
[39:01] Ezekiel uh turn keep your Bible open
[39:04] there in Revelations 5 but I'm just
[39:06] going to reference Ezekiel just here for
[39:09] a minute because it's such a parallel to
[39:12] what we read here in Revelations 5 the
[39:15] ending there of chapter two when we're
[39:17] reading about this nation that he's
[39:19] going to speak to and now this is the
[39:22] Book of Ezekiel uh this is years as we
[39:25] said last Sunday this is years after the
[39:28] ten tribes of Israel have went off into
[39:31] captivity into Assyria and now uh 100
[39:35] years later those tent tribes had
[39:38] ignored the warnings from God's prophets
[39:41] and they had ignored the warning of Amos
[39:44] and God then when they ignored Amos he
[39:47] sends Hosea and and now these same men
[39:50] that were warning them and pleading with
[39:53] them and and and and and now it's it's
[39:56] incredible to think now the only thing
[39:59] left is just two little tribes and these
[40:03] two little tribes had watched had
[40:06] witnessed prophets come ministers
[40:09] Ministry come preach the word of God and
[40:12] they had watched that God's warnings
[40:14] that came through prophets had been
[40:17] spurned and spurned and now judgment was
[40:20] passed and now the ten tribes are taken
[40:22] off into captivity and I and now here's
[40:27] the last two tribes of Israel this is
[40:29] God's family as we said when he's
[40:31] speaking and he's saying this is a
[40:33] rebellious house this is a rebellious
[40:35] people don't don't be afraid of them
[40:37] don't be don't be don't as he tells
[40:40] Jeremiah in another place don't look at
[40:42] their faces you remember that scripture
[40:44] in Jeremiah when Jeremiah's given a
[40:46] scroll and and God tells Jeremiah eat
[40:49] that scroll it'll be sweet in your mouth
[40:50] it'll be bitter in your belly and but
[40:53] God says Jeremiah but I'm gonna I'm
[40:55] going to put something inside of you and
[40:57] don't be dismayed by their facial
[41:00] expressions don't be dismayed by their
[41:03] reactions to the word that I'm giving
[41:05] them and so he says but preach the word
[41:08] you you can't look at circumstances you
[41:10] can't look at the result of what you're
[41:13] preaching is it taking effect is it not
[41:15] taking effect even brother Branham got
[41:17] into this place to where it gave him
[41:19] such a complex because he felt like what
[41:21] he was preaching was just being preached
[41:23] and said amen to but no one ever changed
[41:25] and I come to your churches and you're
[41:27] still the same your women dress the same
[41:29] you're you're still acting the same and
[41:31] I preach and he says they just won't
[41:33] hear me Lord and God brother random
[41:35] commits that in standing in the Gap and
[41:37] says I got just a complex that they
[41:38] wouldn't hear what I had to say
[41:41] and so here you see God admonishing
[41:44] encouraging Ezekiel with the same exact
[41:48] encouragement Ezekiel though they spurn
[41:51] it you've still got to preach it though
[41:53] they reject it you've still got to tell
[41:56] it the though though your family rejects
[41:58] you you've still got to stand though no
[42:01] one goes before you I'm going to put my
[42:03] words my words Ezekiel and sometimes
[42:06] when you stand for the word you stand
[42:09] alone
[42:11] as we preached this here last Sunday and
[42:13] and brother Brandon tells this in in the
[42:16] and and we're just going to go through
[42:17] just a few quotes here just this morning
[42:19] uh bear with me is we just go through
[42:21] some of these and I'll skip if you want
[42:23] to display that I'll skip there's some
[42:24] of these that we're going to cover uh
[42:26] this morning that you got that
[42:28] PowerPoint no if you could display that
[42:30] click diverse uh to slide seven if you
[42:32] could and then I'll control it as as we
[42:35] said standing sometimes for the word you
[42:38] stand alone we're preaching to you this
[42:40] morning don't give me the word and you
[42:42] know that comes at a cost let me just
[42:45] say this the the true word always comes
[42:49] with the cost
[42:51] there's always a price the word of God
[42:54] is free it's a free gift given but when
[42:57] you receive that word there's always a
[43:00] sacrifice there's always a a giving of
[43:03] something you'll never receive what the
[43:06] Lord is trying to give you until you're
[43:08] willing to say Lord no matter what it
[43:11] cost me I want what you want to give me
[43:14] Lord
[43:15] and God really only knows the one who
[43:17] really knows the heart that that's more
[43:19] than just an in verbal confession but
[43:22] it's something that a True Believer
[43:23] wants and so sometimes when you stand as
[43:26] Ezekiel learns for the word you stand
[43:28] alone sometimes you've got to believe
[43:30] what you believe though no one else
[43:33] believes it though no one else accepts
[43:35] it yet when God reveals it to you it's a
[43:38] personal conviction that isn't swayed by
[43:41] your friends it's not swayed by your
[43:44] family it's not swayed by pressure it's
[43:46] not swayed by what's popular when God
[43:49] really convicts you and it it's no
[43:52] longer what my family believes it's no
[43:54] longer what my church practices it's no
[43:57] longer my religious conviction because
[44:00] of what my preacher teaches come on
[44:02] somebody it's it it when it when it when
[44:05] you take the book
[44:07] and when it becomes your your message
[44:10] when when you take the word and it
[44:12] becomes your word and it's not just Mom
[44:15] and Dad in my church and and that's what
[44:17] my dad believed that's what my church
[44:19] believes and that's the practice listen
[44:21] friends we don't have a practice we
[44:23] don't we don't we don't follow the word
[44:25] because of a practice or a discipline or
[44:28] uh you know some type of creed we don't
[44:31] have any Creed here
[44:34] so sometimes you gotta stand alone
[44:37] in fact that's
[44:39] exactly how God wants you to stand
[44:44] in fact that's exactly what the Lord is
[44:47] wanting us to do
[44:49] in in in this age that we live in
[44:52] is to stand alone
[44:56] this is what brother Brandon says here
[44:57] in leadership in 1965. God don't deal
[45:01] with organizations he don't deal with
[45:04] groups he deals with individuals
[45:08] that's right
[45:10] always not in groups individuals
[45:14] one person
[45:17] one person the last days he said I stand
[45:20] at the door knocking If any man not a
[45:23] group not any group If any man will hear
[45:26] my voice and I'll and hear me I'll come
[45:30] in to him and sup see if any man can
[45:34] hear so why do you hang on to some group
[45:37] so uh this is this is not working here
[45:40] Bob I'm not really sure why if you can
[45:42] just control it so why do you hang on
[45:45] hang on to some group when they're all
[45:48] together wrong the Bible said so
[45:50] Revelation 17 it'll all be collected in
[45:54] one group
[45:55] so there's a Harmony as we said Sunday
[45:58] there's a Harmony I wish this worked
[46:01] because I would blink it right now so
[46:02] you can't read ahead there's a Harmony
[46:04] and there's a Unity there's a spirit of
[46:08] of of of of Harmony that's that's at
[46:11] play and the undercurrents of the world
[46:15] and whether even let me just say this
[46:17] here and I won't go
[46:23] to an appear that there's United and it
[46:25] appears that the nation and world is
[46:27] more divided than they've ever been just
[46:30] know that some of those things that
[46:31] Satan puts as as contrast or as
[46:36] polarizing topics he's using those very
[46:40] things that separate people to prepare
[46:43] them for a world order
[46:45] that will unify them all right
[46:48] and so he says he doesn't deal in
[46:50] individuals he deals in groups so
[46:53] there's a Harmony there's a Unity that
[46:55] the world is coming under and the church
[46:57] is involved because he has their pulpits
[47:02] and the the the the education system is
[47:06] involved because he has their minds
[47:09] and the political system is involved and
[47:12] unified because he controls who's in
[47:14] politics so all the world he controls
[47:17] Hollywood
[47:19] that's his headquarters in fact
[47:22] and so he's got a music
[47:24] he's got a he's got a message
[47:27] he's got an atmosphere and he's working
[47:30] towards a Harmony or a Unity now brother
[47:34] Madam says but out of there will come
[47:36] notice it'll all be collected in one
[47:38] group display that please but out of
[47:40] there will come individuals that's right
[47:43] with God not the group right the
[47:46] individual right the individual in the
[47:50] group
[47:51] now we find out then we fuss and go on
[47:54] about we belong to this and we belong to
[47:56] that and that don't mean one thing to
[47:59] God
[48:01] it's you as an individual listen to me
[48:04] young people
[48:06] it's you
[48:08] as an individual
[48:11] you've got to stand on your own feet
[48:15] you're the one that has to make the
[48:18] testimony
[48:21] each one of you has to do that to answer
[48:24] to God for the Revelation now I just
[48:26] want you to catch what the holy spirit
[48:28] is is saying this morning because I
[48:31] don't have some great big boom here so
[48:33] don't wait for it don't wait for the
[48:34] grand finale this is the grand finale
[48:36] just catch on right now
[48:39] you've got to stand on your own feet
[48:42] you're the one that has to make the
[48:45] testimony each one of you has to do that
[48:48] to answer to God for the Revelation look
[48:51] at Jesus that we know oh he says look at
[48:53] Jesus all that we know he was manifested
[48:56] word of God we believe that the Bible
[48:57] said it was well watch notice when he
[49:00] done the Messiah sign so brother Adam
[49:01] says every year the individual stands on
[49:05] their own God doesn't deal with the
[49:06] group God's not looking for a Unity God
[49:09] yes we believe in Brotherhood yes we
[49:12] believe in real Unity yes we believe in
[49:14] in the end thank you brother John yes we
[49:16] believe that that we should be in
[49:18] harmony that family should operate in
[49:20] harmony that families should operate in
[49:22] unity but there's got to be something
[49:24] listen there's got to be something that
[49:28] unites us
[49:30] if there's going to be a uniting time
[49:33] and sign then there's got to be
[49:36] something that we can unite around
[49:38] and it's and it can't be our opinions
[49:41] because that leads to denominationalism
[49:44] it can be our theories because that
[49:47] leads to one-man Ministries and as we
[49:50] said last Sunday there was a one-man
[49:51] Ministry and that was Jesus Christ
[49:54] revealed through a Vindicated son of man
[49:56] prophet
[49:58] and outside of that there is no other
[50:00] one-man Ministry
[50:03] oh I just feel to preach this morning
[50:04] I'm getting ahead of myself there is no
[50:07] one one there is listen to me friends
[50:08] there is no one Pulpit to rule them all
[50:13] there is no one Ministry to correct them
[50:15] all God has not ordained the finefold
[50:18] ministry to correct all the rest of the
[50:21] gifts in the body
[50:23] God has put Ministry and Ministry over
[50:25] local churches and local visions and
[50:28] Sovereign bodies I'm going to keep
[50:30] preaching and Sovereign bodies listen
[50:32] we're part of a global bride that the
[50:35] many member Body of Christ that's all
[50:37] that's not just in America it's all over
[50:40] the entire world or part of a group of
[50:42] brothers who believe like we believe
[50:43] we're part of the family of God but God
[50:46] is not looking for a group Revival he
[50:49] wants a Revival in the heart of each
[50:51] individual
[50:54] and there's not one organization we
[50:56] don't have a headquarters
[50:59] I'm thankful for gifts of God I'm
[51:01] thankful for men who are gifted that I
[51:03] glean from and teachers that I gleaned
[51:05] from and and Men of God but let me just
[51:08] say this they're not perfect and I'm not
[51:10] perfect there's only one thing that's
[51:12] perfect and that's the revealed word
[51:17] so he's so so let me get to my thought
[51:19] here this morning
[51:21] so they they ignored the voices of God
[51:25] they ignored the voice of God that was
[51:28] revealed through a prophet now Ezekiel
[51:30] comes to them and watched
[51:32] I think it's so incredible they had
[51:34] watched over and over you can blink that
[51:37] display they had watched over and over
[51:39] prophets coming warning coming and then
[51:42] judgment comes and they're taken into
[51:44] captivity and yet you look at
[51:46] historically when ezekiel's coming to
[51:47] minister here yet
[51:49] Judah here's Benjamin here's the last
[51:52] two tribes and they're more backslidden
[51:57] then the tin tribes who were just taken
[51:59] away
[52:01] I was just reading just the history of
[52:03] this throughout the the uh uh wasn't
[52:05] Josephus but another historian here
[52:07] about just the condition
[52:09] of of God's people and it's incredible
[52:12] because they were actually worse and I
[52:15] thought to myself about how how can you
[52:17] watch your brothers and your sisters to
[52:20] see the the visible evidence of God's
[52:24] warning and then judgment come to pass
[52:26] and somehow you ignore it
[52:33] they they watched what ignoring a
[52:35] prophet's message
[52:37] brings
[52:40] and so now here's Ezekiel the voice of
[52:43] warning the voice of impending judgment
[52:47] and so was it what what is it listen
[52:50] what is it about human nature
[52:54] that we can watch the word of God be
[52:57] fulfilled to the letter and yet
[53:00] stubbornness
[53:02] to let go of things that the word is
[53:05] calling us out on yet we hold on to
[53:07] those things
[53:10] what is it in the nature of people what
[53:13] is it the nature of even God's family
[53:15] and and we can't just put this out out
[53:18] here outside
[53:19] thank you brother but what is it in the
[53:21] nature of people that we could hear the
[53:24] word of God and I'm identifying myself
[53:27] here this morning this isn't this is
[53:28] Brother Matt preaching at brother Matt
[53:30] that we can know the word of God then
[53:33] the instruction of the word of God the
[53:35] voice of God we can watch what happens
[53:37] around us but if we're not careful we
[53:40] get Bewitched as we spoke of Balaam we
[53:42] get lackadaisical we get out of tune
[53:45] with the harmony and the of the word and
[53:47] we get in tune with the gospel of
[53:49] Hollywood
[53:51] and we can hear and watch the signs all
[53:54] around us we can see this The Voice we
[53:56] can hear the voice of the Sun
[53:59] and yet they be just become more
[54:02] stubborn and and they ignored the
[54:04] warnings from Isaiah they in fact they
[54:06] got harder the more this is what's
[54:08] incredible it's the more Isaiah preached
[54:10] the harder they got
[54:13] now that's what the that's what the
[54:15] preaching of the true gospel will do
[54:17] it'll either soften your heart or Harden
[54:20] your heart
[54:22] and it all depends on how you receive it
[54:25] so they actually got harder the more the
[54:28] more Isaiah preached this is actually
[54:30] the the what you could read this in the
[54:32] book of Isaiah where the the children of
[54:34] Israel said we're fed up with Isaiah
[54:37] we're fed up we don't want to hear it
[54:39] anymore
[54:40] don't prophesy us don't don't the
[54:42] prophets don't Prof they say to their
[54:44] prophets don't prophesy into their seers
[54:45] don't see
[54:47] what a condition to get into
[54:49] prophesying this lies
[54:51] tell us deceits
[54:55] that they ignored the prophet Micah they
[54:57] ignored the Prophet Jeremiah the the
[54:59] habakkuk is another Prophet that comes
[55:01] right before Ezekiel and he gives them
[55:03] the same warning the same the same thing
[55:06] but here God comes to Ezekiel and look
[55:09] at Ezekiel chapter 2 chapter one if you
[55:11] could just quickly Ezekiel 1 just
[55:14] quickly if you could turn there
[55:16] Ezekiel chapter one notice this and he
[55:19] says here
[55:22] no let's go to let's go to chapter two
[55:24] let's go to our our text
[55:26] and he said unto me son of man
[55:29] now this is amazing that he calls him
[55:32] this
[55:33] he says unto him son of man
[55:36] prophesy you you have that in ezekiel's
[55:39] drought the vision of the dry bones
[55:41] later in the end of the of the book and
[55:44] Ezekiel the Lord is saying son of man
[55:47] prophesy
[55:49] and he says say unto the bones can they
[55:51] live and and he and he says any and he
[55:54] uses this phrase you know now I I could
[55:56] stand correction but I think I'm correct
[55:58] on this that the Bible never there's no
[56:01] other place
[56:03] that a prophet's called son of man
[56:05] except Jesus in the New Testament but
[56:09] Ezekiel there's something different
[56:11] about the ministry of this man Ezekiel
[56:14] as we know he was the last this is some
[56:16] of the last words that they're going to
[56:18] hear so he was the prophet called son of
[56:21] man and and so you here's here's
[56:24] something powerful about him he was a
[56:25] prophet and he was also a priest I'm not
[56:28] sure where the connection I'm not making
[56:30] a connection of that today but he shows
[56:33] the Bible calls him the son of man now
[56:35] listen to what brother Branham begins to
[56:37] say here and we're just going to take
[56:38] just a little a little turn here and
[56:41] then we'll come back to our scripture so
[56:43] can you bear with me and just keep your
[56:45] attention here this morning because I
[56:47] don't I I didn't feel fully prepared to
[56:50] preach what I'm about to go through
[56:51] myself but the Lord just just made me so
[56:55] we're going to
[56:57] you all right
[56:58] listen to my brother random says if you
[57:00] could put that PowerPoint look at Jesus
[57:01] all that we knowed he was this is the
[57:04] identify the identified Christ of all
[57:06] ages
[57:07] let me pull it up here to make sure I
[57:09] follow along
[57:10] uh with you look at Jesus oh that we
[57:14] knowed he was the manifested word of God
[57:17] we believe that the Bible said it was
[57:19] well watch when he'd done his Messiah
[57:22] sign the Pharisees that had a little bit
[57:26] of light now listen to this they was
[57:28] good people lived a good Christian Life
[57:30] or and he corrects it or a religious
[57:33] life
[57:34] had a little
[57:36] a little light about them
[57:39] they had organized and a priesthood they
[57:42] had a little light but down on the
[57:45] bottom of their heart they had no
[57:48] Eternal representation in glory
[57:52] so you can have a little bit of
[57:54] religious light but have no Eternal
[57:58] representation
[57:59] now remember remember God's family is
[58:02] made up of of of of of of many different
[58:04] classifications of people
[58:06] we don't have time to teach on that this
[58:08] morning but remember that there's an
[58:10] elected group there's a predestinated
[58:12] group that was predestinated with the
[58:15] seed of God the germ of God the life of
[58:17] God before the foundation of the world
[58:19] remember brother Baron I'm in the church
[58:21] age book he says you didn't he says you
[58:23] didn't become seed and you didn't
[58:25] because you didn't become seed when you
[58:27] were came to an altar and you repent now
[58:30] this is powerful principle that we don't
[58:32] want to gloss over you didn't become
[58:34] seed because you came up to an altar and
[58:36] you repented of all your sins and you
[58:38] gave your heart to the Lord and he says
[58:40] no he says you didn't become seed you
[58:43] didn't you weren't he says you didn't
[58:44] become seed by a new birth you were seed
[58:48] and so therefore you were Reborn
[58:51] and so God has a family with the germ of
[58:54] Life inside of them and so you when you
[58:56] come to them when the message of the
[58:57] hour the truth of the light of the
[58:59] Gospel strikes that seed then brother
[59:02] Branham said the light flashes the word
[59:04] is the light that flashes across that
[59:06] seat and it will come to life
[59:08] and you don't have to beg it you don't
[59:10] have to but you don't have to plead you
[59:12] don't have to pressure it it's the seed
[59:15] of God if you get it in the right
[59:17] atmosphere it will groom
[59:21] and so they had no Eternal
[59:23] representation in glory so when they
[59:26] seen that Supernatural done they said
[59:28] this man is Beelzebub a devil and what
[59:31] happened that put what light they had
[59:35] out
[59:37] amen
[59:39] that put what that little light that
[59:42] they had out
[59:44] what brother Matt I'm gonna make this so
[59:46] simple because they failed to recognize
[59:49] this is what brother random say and when
[59:51] they seen the supernatural
[59:52] they called it blzibub when it was
[59:55] Jehovah Jireh
[59:58] and he says they put what little light
[1:00:00] they had they put it out but listen to
[1:00:02] this but here was a little ill-famed
[1:00:05] woman a prostitute
[1:00:07] down in her heart well
[1:00:10] she had a representation of one of God's
[1:00:13] thoughts
[1:00:15] amen there she was
[1:00:17] waited in sin I want to want you to make
[1:00:20] sure you catch this here she was waited
[1:00:23] in sin yet in her heart in other words
[1:00:26] what she was externally was not who she
[1:00:29] was internally
[1:00:30] what everybody else seen on the outside
[1:00:33] was not actually who she was
[1:00:36] yet to the Pharisee what everybody's
[1:00:38] seen as a religious person was actually
[1:00:41] not who they were
[1:00:43] [Applause]
[1:00:44] and he says down on her heart she had a
[1:00:47] representation of one of God's thought
[1:00:49] there she was weighted in sin but when
[1:00:52] she seen that happen
[1:00:55] so when she's seen the sign of the son
[1:00:57] of man in Jesus when she seen that
[1:01:01] happen she said sir I believe you're a
[1:01:04] prophet
[1:01:06] I know when the Messiah cometh he'll
[1:01:08] tell us these things what did he do it
[1:01:11] cleansed her life
[1:01:16] what a powerful thing that the word
[1:01:18] recognizing do you realize when you
[1:01:21] reject the word of God it pollutes and
[1:01:24] destroys your life but when you accept
[1:01:27] the word of God it cleans your life
[1:01:30] [Applause]
[1:01:32] he was her Redeemer to her because he
[1:01:34] could lift her up from where she had
[1:01:37] come from in other words his gospel and
[1:01:40] his word connect all he could do is hard
[1:01:43] in the hearts of the Pharisee but to the
[1:01:45] believer it lifted them up out of where
[1:01:47] they were and I say today the message of
[1:01:49] the hour I didn't darken my heart it
[1:01:52] didn't give me bondage it had the power
[1:01:54] to lift me up out of who I was and where
[1:01:57] I was
[1:01:58] Glory
[1:02:00] but they said Son of David notice when
[1:02:02] blind Bartimaeus run out and recognize
[1:02:04] him David meant King remember son of man
[1:02:07] son of David
[1:02:09] Son of God which was Lord
[1:02:12] this Jew God this is the trial 1964. now
[1:02:15] we've changed messages so listen but
[1:02:18] they said Son of David when blind
[1:02:20] Bartimaeus ran out and recognized him
[1:02:21] David meant King
[1:02:25] remember son of man
[1:02:27] son of David Son of God remember brother
[1:02:30] random teaches us this
[1:02:32] I'm just going to pull some notes that I
[1:02:35] don't have
[1:02:36] that I don't have on the on the overhead
[1:02:39] but are on the on the slides but I will
[1:02:42] have them I will just go through them
[1:02:43] just for a moment just give me just bear
[1:02:45] with me just a moment
[1:02:47] I had to pull it up on my screen so
[1:02:49] remember brother Branham says that and
[1:02:51] he says now remember and he says these
[1:02:54] two words this is God is a provided way
[1:02:56] in 1962.
[1:02:59] and he says now remember these two words
[1:03:01] before I leave you the appearing of
[1:03:04] Christ and the coming of Christ is two
[1:03:07] different things
[1:03:08] Christ is now appearing in the fullness
[1:03:12] when
[1:03:14] now
[1:03:17] Christ is now appearing in the fullness
[1:03:20] of the Papa's power his coming will be
[1:03:23] afterwards his appearing before his
[1:03:28] coming
[1:03:30] now brother random says this he says but
[1:03:32] they said Son of David remember brother
[1:03:34] man taught us this that he comes in
[1:03:35] three son of David Son of God Son of Man
[1:03:38] now that's not the that this is that we
[1:03:41] could we could uh re we could show you
[1:03:43] that in in so many places in the message
[1:03:45] but I just want to paraphrase some of
[1:03:47] this because I've got too much that what
[1:03:49] we could get to today but he says he
[1:03:51] comes and see remember son of man son of
[1:03:53] David Son of God which was Lord
[1:03:56] this Jew got what he asked for because
[1:03:59] he approached him in the name of son of
[1:04:02] David the king he wasn't savior listen
[1:04:07] but he was King now but when the Greek
[1:04:11] woman the seraphination approached him
[1:04:13] in the name of son of David he never
[1:04:16] even as much raised his head
[1:04:21] he never even as much raised his head
[1:04:24] she had no claims on him in the name of
[1:04:27] son of David
[1:04:28] he wasn't son of David to that Seraph
[1:04:32] Phoenician woman
[1:04:33] but when she said Lord then he turned
[1:04:37] around
[1:04:38] he was the Lord see Lord he was Lord no
[1:04:43] son of David to her now why wasn't he
[1:04:46] recognized the son of man the son of man
[1:04:49] was the spiritual Revelation now listen
[1:04:52] to what brother Venom says this now why
[1:04:54] wasn't he recognized the son of man the
[1:04:57] son of man was the spiritual Revelation
[1:05:00] a prophet
[1:05:02] son of man means Prophet now if you turn
[1:05:06] over in your Bible to Ezekiel the second
[1:05:08] chapter and the first verse you'll find
[1:05:11] out that Ezekiel was the prophet listen
[1:05:13] Alice lays this out Ezekiel was the
[1:05:16] prophet the word of God for that day
[1:05:23] Ezekiel was the prophet the word of God
[1:05:26] for that day and Jehovah himself called
[1:05:30] him the son of man
[1:05:34] Jehovah called him a man the son of man
[1:05:38] the same as Jesus revealed himself
[1:05:43] as son of man
[1:05:46] now where does I I just want to just to
[1:05:49] turn here just for a minute
[1:05:51] and I know I keep saying that shape of
[1:05:53] the matter you're gonna you keep making
[1:05:54] a lot of turns we're gonna get back
[1:05:56] don't worry
[1:05:59] [Applause]
[1:06:03] that the the Rapture as we as we've
[1:06:05] taught this here before and so we won't
[1:06:07] take a lot of time to lay a lot of
[1:06:08] groundwork
[1:06:09] but we know that the Rapture of the
[1:06:11] church is it happens brother random says
[1:06:14] in three stages
[1:06:16] and you remember brother random says
[1:06:17] that all three of those stages the shout
[1:06:19] the voice and the trumpet brother random
[1:06:23] says Christ does all three as he's
[1:06:26] descending now we read that in
[1:06:28] Revelations 5 turn to Revelation 7 if
[1:06:30] you can just quickly Revelations chapter
[1:06:33] 7. I'm sorry chapter 10 chapter 10. and
[1:06:37] I saw another Mighty Angel come down
[1:06:40] from heaven clothed with the cloud and a
[1:06:44] rainbow is upon his head and his face
[1:06:47] and his face was as it were the son and
[1:06:51] his feet as pillars of fire and he had
[1:06:54] in his hand a little book open now this
[1:06:57] is the same book that you see in
[1:06:59] Revelations 5 right but in Revelations
[1:07:02] five it's a closed book now he's got a
[1:07:04] little book and it's open in his hand or
[1:07:07] are you with me here this morning this
[1:07:09] is simple just write that write down
[1:07:11] where the rubber meets the road for a
[1:07:13] believer
[1:07:14] yeah
[1:07:16] amen and he said his and he set his
[1:07:18] right foot upon the sea and his left
[1:07:21] foot upon the Earth and cried with a
[1:07:23] loud voice as when a lion roared and
[1:07:25] when he cried seven Thunders uttered
[1:07:27] their voices and when the seven Thunders
[1:07:29] had uttered their voices I was about to
[1:07:32] ride and I Heard a Voice from Heaven
[1:07:33] saying unto me fill up those things
[1:07:35] which the seven Thunders uttered and
[1:07:36] write them not and the angel which I saw
[1:07:39] upon the sea and and upon the Earth
[1:07:41] lifted up his hand to heaven and move on
[1:07:44] down to verse let's just keep reading it
[1:07:46] verse six and swear by him that liveth
[1:07:47] forever and ever who created heaven and
[1:07:49] the things that their the than the
[1:07:51] things that therein are and the earth
[1:07:53] and the things that therein are and the
[1:07:54] Sea and the things which are therein
[1:07:57] that there should be time no longer but
[1:08:00] in the days of the voice of the seventh
[1:08:04] angel when he shall begin to sound the
[1:08:07] mystery of God should be finished as he
[1:08:12] has declared unto his servants the
[1:08:14] prophets so he says and the voice which
[1:08:17] I heard from Heaven spoken to me again
[1:08:19] and said go and take the little notebook
[1:08:21] so something there's a there's something
[1:08:24] that takes place from verse 7 and verse
[1:08:28] 8 right there's a transaction there's a
[1:08:31] transfer of something that that John is
[1:08:35] seeing here which is a type of the Bride
[1:08:37] there's a transaction that here he comes
[1:08:39] in verse 7 and he says in the days of
[1:08:42] the voice of the seventh angel when he
[1:08:44] shall begin to sound the mystery of God
[1:08:46] should be finished and so now that same
[1:08:48] voice which he heard speaks and says now
[1:08:51] go and take the book in other words it
[1:08:54] can't just remain as a sounding Shout
[1:08:58] but that shout has to now become a voice
[1:09:02] the same way that God's mind and God's
[1:09:05] word says to Ezekiel I'll put my words
[1:09:09] into your mouth
[1:09:11] and when you say what I say
[1:09:15] you're the voice of God
[1:09:18] now this is what son of man meant it
[1:09:20] meant that it was a Ministry that hadn't
[1:09:23] that had the voice of God as John as he
[1:09:25] says here in the voice which heard from
[1:09:27] Seven sake said go and take the little
[1:09:29] book which is open in the hand of the
[1:09:32] Angel which standeth upon the sea and
[1:09:34] upon the earth now listen to what
[1:09:36] brother Branham says here and this is
[1:09:37] this is uh 1963 Souls that are in prison
[1:09:42] and he says but remember all this time
[1:09:45] Noah was in the ark the bride is sealed
[1:09:47] in with Christ the last member has been
[1:09:50] redeemed The Sixth Seal has produced
[1:09:52] itself you can just you can blank that
[1:09:54] for a minute the seventh seal brings him
[1:09:58] back to Earth
[1:10:01] let's say that again the seventh seal
[1:10:04] brings him back to Earth
[1:10:07] the lamb come and took the book out of
[1:10:09] the right hand of him that sat down and
[1:10:11] claimed what he owned what he redeemed
[1:10:14] is that right it's always been the third
[1:10:16] pull three is perfection the ministry
[1:10:20] come to its Perfection when it
[1:10:24] reproduced Christ again
[1:10:27] in natural
[1:10:29] amongst human beings
[1:10:32] as was predicted as it was in the days
[1:10:35] of lot oh thank people could go right on
[1:10:38] preaching thinking they're getting saved
[1:10:41] believing listen what brother Brandon
[1:10:43] says here believing they're doing right
[1:10:44] believing their organizations are
[1:10:46] growing not even a ray of Hope and if
[1:10:49] that Vision was that and it's been so
[1:10:51] hard against women we've come to that
[1:10:52] hour the door is closed gone already the
[1:10:55] book is in his hand think of it so
[1:10:57] brother Brandon begins to say things
[1:10:59] you'll find this in Souls that are in
[1:11:00] prison even this in the seventh seal and
[1:11:02] it's almost time to bring in a
[1:11:04] correlation and say is this what's
[1:11:06] taking place is Mercy over are we
[1:11:09] preaching now to souls that are in
[1:11:11] prison right now but notice what he
[1:11:13] points this is the seventh seal in 1963.
[1:11:16] there was some reason that God led the
[1:11:19] seven voices be thunder because it must
[1:11:22] come see we find that Christ the lamb
[1:11:26] took the book in his hand and he opened
[1:11:29] the seventh seal but you see it's a
[1:11:31] hidden Mystery no one knows it
[1:11:35] it's right along with what he said no
[1:11:37] one would know his coming they also
[1:11:40] would not know about this seven Thunder
[1:11:42] mystery now I'm not preaching on the
[1:11:43] seven Thunder mystery so don't get
[1:11:45] scared and fall asleep
[1:11:46] he says that what no one would know
[1:11:48] about this seven Thunder mystery so you
[1:11:51] see this is what I'm going to under I
[1:11:53] got underline my my notes Here you see
[1:11:55] it's connected together
[1:11:58] that much we have an understanding of it
[1:12:00] today because the rest of it is all
[1:12:02] unfolded but this is not unfolded but
[1:12:05] sitting in my room and I heard this and
[1:12:08] I heard it rather but I've seen it
[1:12:10] unfold to this seven Thunders now he
[1:12:13] says that's as far as we can go right
[1:12:16] there
[1:12:18] that's as far as we can go right there
[1:12:21] so you see even even the even as brother
[1:12:24] branham's beginning to lay this out and
[1:12:26] you've got to follow the message all the
[1:12:27] way through and not just stop here at
[1:12:29] what he says in the seventh seal but as
[1:12:31] brother Brandon begins to lay this out
[1:12:33] that the coming of the Lord would come
[1:12:35] in stages that it wasn't as the church
[1:12:38] as the nominal church as the religious
[1:12:41] world thinks today that he'll come down
[1:12:44] and that the Rapture of the church the
[1:12:46] coming of the Lord the second coming
[1:12:48] would be when Christ comes down in a a
[1:12:50] great the sky opens up and a red carpet
[1:12:54] rolls down and then Jesus walks out and
[1:12:56] and all and everybody sees him and falls
[1:13:00] down and worships him they even let me
[1:13:02] go further and say it's not it's not
[1:13:04] people just disappearing that's not all
[1:13:07] that it is
[1:13:08] it's not the Rapture is not just I want
[1:13:11] to get your minds here this morning the
[1:13:13] Rapture is not just a moment in an
[1:13:17] instant
[1:13:18] that's been called that that's been
[1:13:19] waiting and then it happens and then
[1:13:22] it's over
[1:13:23] but the Rapture is a accumulation
[1:13:28] or a condensing
[1:13:30] or a or a cycle that takes place
[1:13:35] and so the coming of the Lord is brother
[1:13:37] Brandon would say he would come as Son
[1:13:39] of God he'd come as son of David he
[1:13:41] would come as son of man so there had to
[1:13:44] be the coming or the appearing of the
[1:13:46] Lord that that that would come to as
[1:13:49] brother Madam says take to to to prepare
[1:13:52] the people there had to be a word that
[1:13:56] silenced the voices of opinions of what
[1:13:59] he was and of who he was and of who he's
[1:14:02] going to be
[1:14:04] as we know today as we've said here
[1:14:06] before there's hundreds of denominations
[1:14:08] and hun thousands of denominations and
[1:14:10] thousands of ideas if you just sit down
[1:14:12] and ask yourself the simple question why
[1:14:14] do some Churches why why are there why
[1:14:17] are there so many thousands of churches
[1:14:21] with ideas about not just Christ but
[1:14:25] about his church
[1:14:27] about his body about how they conduct
[1:14:30] Church how they operate church we have
[1:14:33] so many different flavors in the world
[1:14:34] today and you say why are there so many
[1:14:37] interpretations yet they have one book
[1:14:42] hello
[1:14:43] there's one book
[1:14:45] and yet out of that one book there could
[1:14:49] come a thought on baptism that varies
[1:14:52] from one Church to the next to the next
[1:14:53] to the next to the next
[1:14:56] there's there's a thought on
[1:14:57] predestination that comes from one
[1:14:59] Church to One Church to the church to
[1:15:00] the next Church
[1:15:02] there's thoughts on how how how women
[1:15:04] should dress from one Church to the next
[1:15:06] Church to the next Church to the next
[1:15:07] Church
[1:15:08] there's thoughts on on on you can name
[1:15:11] any category here today not just
[1:15:13] biblical Doctrine not just that they
[1:15:15] differ on Election not that they just
[1:15:17] differ on the coming of the Lord and the
[1:15:19] Rapture the Millennium the tribulation
[1:15:22] but in every category through one book
[1:15:25] there's a thousand thousands of voices
[1:15:28] with different opinions so what did God
[1:15:31] have to do God would have to sin The
[1:15:34] Voice a loud voice why was it allowed
[1:15:38] voices when a lion roared because it
[1:15:39] wasn't just going to be the another
[1:15:40] opinion of man wow it wasn't just going
[1:15:43] to be a well I think or I I think this
[1:15:45] is what it means wasn't even just going
[1:15:47] to be a teaching it was going to be a
[1:15:49] loud voice
[1:15:50] yes as when a lion roarth
[1:15:54] so what happens when a line Roars all
[1:15:56] the other voices fall silent
[1:15:58] hello somebody
[1:16:00] all the other voices fall silent and so
[1:16:04] brother random says here continue on our
[1:16:06] slides if you could and I know I'm
[1:16:08] laying a lot of this in here and so just
[1:16:10] give me some time just here for a moment
[1:16:11] bear with me I know you believe the
[1:16:13] message so I take great comfort in what
[1:16:15] I'm reading even if you you wouldn't
[1:16:17] misunderstand something that I'm saying
[1:16:18] this morning we got we got Believers
[1:16:20] here
[1:16:21] so Ezekiel was the prophet he was the
[1:16:23] word of God for that day and Jehovah
[1:16:25] himself called him the son of man
[1:16:27] Jehovah called him a man now notice the
[1:16:29] promise of the word listen in the Bold
[1:16:31] the promised word of that hour being
[1:16:34] made manifest same God God of ezekiel's
[1:16:38] time God of Jesus time son of man
[1:16:41] now listen to what brother Adam says
[1:16:43] here he was the son of man because he
[1:16:46] had come to reveal himself to Israel as
[1:16:49] a prophet and they rejected it and that
[1:16:52] was the prophecy that they should
[1:16:54] receive him in the name of the son of
[1:16:56] man a prophet because it was according
[1:16:59] to the word Deuteronomy 18 15 the Lord
[1:17:01] your God shall raise up a prophet like
[1:17:03] it unto me and when he come he
[1:17:05] identified himself in his ministry as a
[1:17:08] man not a son of God
[1:17:10] son of man
[1:17:13] God is a spirit he revealed himself as a
[1:17:16] son of man what he claimed to be and
[1:17:20] they was blind and they was blinded and
[1:17:22] they couldn't see it Jesus said as it
[1:17:25] was in the days of Sodom now he points
[1:17:27] this to Revelation I'm sorry to to Luke
[1:17:29] 17 Jesus said as it was in the days of
[1:17:33] Sodom when the son of man is being
[1:17:37] revealed
[1:17:39] in the days of Sodom was the son that
[1:17:44] was God
[1:17:45] revealed in human flesh
[1:17:49] which was one time brother Adam says
[1:17:51] called Melchizedek the father
[1:17:53] Melchizedek at that time had no father
[1:17:55] no mother no beginning of days no wonder
[1:17:57] in her life ever who he was he remained
[1:18:00] the same Jesus had father and mother but
[1:18:02] this man had neither father nor mother
[1:18:05] and he appeared to Abraham I lost my
[1:18:09] place sorry he appeared to Abraham
[1:18:12] in the form of Son of Man
[1:18:16] he says he imported it and he appeared
[1:18:19] in the Abraham in the form of Son of Man
[1:18:22] Elohim Jehovah
[1:18:26] now brother Adam says this is what Luke
[1:18:27] 17 this is what Luke 17 is referring to
[1:18:30] in the days of the coming of the son of
[1:18:33] man what was that son of man Ministry it
[1:18:37] was the ministry of Jesus in a prophet
[1:18:40] revealed through human flesh
[1:18:44] now that now now you say for the math
[1:18:47] that's all that's that's good that's
[1:18:48] wonderful we believe that we say we say
[1:18:51] Amen to that uh uh we we believe now
[1:18:54] listen to what brother Brandon says here
[1:18:55] in Legacy in church change I'm going to
[1:18:56] skip down to the very bottom and he says
[1:18:58] now I said a moment ago that the false
[1:19:00] Vine come into full fruition in this age
[1:19:02] her fruit would mature and ripen that's
[1:19:04] correct this evil spirited Church full
[1:19:06] of iniquity will be revealed as the
[1:19:08] mustard seed that grew into a tree where
[1:19:10] in launch the fowls of the air at her
[1:19:12] head will be the Antichrist the mystery
[1:19:14] of iniquity all this is true and if this
[1:19:18] is true then it must also be true that
[1:19:21] that bright church WIll mature
[1:19:24] and her ripeness shall be an
[1:19:28] identification with her Lord by means of
[1:19:31] the word and her head will come to her
[1:19:35] is the mystery of godliness
[1:19:39] which indeed is Christ and as the false
[1:19:43] church with all kind of diabolical power
[1:19:45] made up of political force physical
[1:19:47] force and demons of Darkness come
[1:19:50] against this True Vine the True Vine
[1:19:52] with the fullness of the spirit and the
[1:19:55] word will do the very acts of power that
[1:19:59] Jesus did
[1:20:00] do you believe that as a Believer today
[1:20:03] so who was the son of man Ministry
[1:20:06] coming to not just a prophet but that
[1:20:09] son of man the Christ son of man Jesus
[1:20:12] revealed in flesh would have to transfer
[1:20:15] to John the bride
[1:20:17] she would have to eat the book she would
[1:20:20] have to prophesy again what does it mean
[1:20:22] by the man it means that not everything
[1:20:24] that we not everything that we see that
[1:20:27] we place in the power of God is not
[1:20:29] coming just for one man it's coming for
[1:20:31] a mini-membered body
[1:20:34] and so much that brother Branham said
[1:20:36] that she would do the very acts of power
[1:20:38] that Jesus did
[1:20:41] as she nears her headstone
[1:20:44] becoming like him through the word
[1:20:48] Jesus will come that the bride and groom
[1:20:50] may be forever United as one
[1:20:55] [Applause]
[1:20:56] man
[1:20:58] you say brother Matt where are you going
[1:21:00] this morning now I just want to stop
[1:21:02] here just for a moment
[1:21:03] and I'm going to take another term
[1:21:07] I've read all the things that I've read
[1:21:08] today
[1:21:09] and all this is what the Lord put up put
[1:21:11] put on my heart to say
[1:21:13] and I've read all the things that are
[1:21:15] that are that are
[1:21:17] uh how could I say this that our crucial
[1:21:22] they are Paramount
[1:21:25] to the believer
[1:21:28] to recognize
[1:21:30] that the message of the hour was not
[1:21:33] doctrines it wasn't books it wasn't
[1:21:36] tapes it was in stories it was Christ
[1:21:39] returning
[1:21:41] right brother random breaches the
[1:21:43] message who do you say this is and his
[1:21:45] entire thought is even the premise of
[1:21:47] the entire trial brother Brandon calls
[1:21:49] the blind prosecutor and he calls the
[1:21:51] the the different witnesses to the stand
[1:21:53] and you can go down to the very end of
[1:21:56] that sermon and brother random takes
[1:21:58] this entire message in the trial and we
[1:22:00] we we won't we we'll just read one more
[1:22:02] quote from it listen to this here and he
[1:22:04] says Mr prosecutor I want you to know
[1:22:07] and he says I want you to know that I
[1:22:09] could call thousands of witnesses here
[1:22:11] this afternoon I want you to know that
[1:22:13] these things that he said that he did we
[1:22:15] are witnesses that he keeps his word
[1:22:18] there's a genuine Holy Ghost meeting
[1:22:21] there is a genuine power of God there's
[1:22:25] a genuine promise that they shall
[1:22:27] recover when they lay hands on the sick
[1:22:28] I want you to know that I want you to
[1:22:31] know he said as it was in the days of
[1:22:33] Sodom so shall it be in the coming of
[1:22:36] the son of man Revelations 10 promised
[1:22:39] the whole mystery how are you going to
[1:22:41] reveal the Mysteries
[1:22:42] see what Luther left off see what Wesley
[1:22:45] left off see what Pentecost left off and
[1:22:49] reveal the secret of the heart to make
[1:22:52] it the same God through every age
[1:22:56] which is nothing but God's word being
[1:22:59] made manifest
[1:23:00] back
[1:23:02] to the son of man again
[1:23:06] look at what I've got underlined here we
[1:23:08] don't look for now scars
[1:23:11] we don't look for nail scars we look for
[1:23:14] the word
[1:23:15] made manifest I'm preaching you on give
[1:23:18] me the word notice God promised these
[1:23:20] things and he does it justice he said I
[1:23:22] could say more but we'll leave the
[1:23:23] subject it's getting late we don't look
[1:23:25] for now scars we look for the word you
[1:23:27] say for the man did Brother Bear them
[1:23:29] not believe in the nail scarred Jesus
[1:23:31] did he not believe that in the physical
[1:23:33] Corporal return absolutely he did that's
[1:23:36] he says well of course we believe that's
[1:23:38] what Believers believe
[1:23:40] but to to fail to recognize that Jesus
[1:23:45] is his word
[1:23:47] and his word came down and was restored
[1:23:50] is to miss the return of Christ
[1:23:55] let me see this further he's not coming
[1:23:57] corporally physically to Rapture and to
[1:24:00] put snatch out of church to a people
[1:24:02] that hasn't recognized him in his word
[1:24:06] [Applause]
[1:24:07] that what was it that's why brother
[1:24:09] Brandon points to what is that pillar
[1:24:11] what is that that cloud that appeared in
[1:24:13] Arizona that's our Lord up there
[1:24:17] what was that it was the headship as
[1:24:19] brother and we just read it as she nears
[1:24:21] her headship comes to her she becomes
[1:24:23] into that that word the prophet of God
[1:24:25] says the Church of God it's becoming the
[1:24:28] bride all the time
[1:24:31] by believing the word of God
[1:24:33] [Applause]
[1:24:35] by believing the word of God how am I
[1:24:37] becoming the bride brother man how am I
[1:24:39] becoming what I'm hearing preached by
[1:24:41] believing the word of God by hearing the
[1:24:44] word of God can you say Amen
[1:24:46] but by hearing the word of God but let
[1:24:48] me give you the scripture how shall they
[1:24:50] hear
[1:24:52] unless there be a preacher
[1:24:57] how shall they hear unless there be a
[1:25:00] preacher is that what the word of God
[1:25:01] says
[1:25:03] how shall they hear and so so there's
[1:25:05] got to be a Ministry the the the the the
[1:25:07] the same chapter says for Faith cometh
[1:25:10] by hearing
[1:25:13] and hearing of the word of God
[1:25:16] how how do we become the bride by how
[1:25:19] are we becoming the bride how are we
[1:25:22] coming into his very image by coming to
[1:25:23] a church
[1:25:25] by by calling herself a Believer by by
[1:25:28] saying that we believe the message Faith
[1:25:31] cometh by hearing
[1:25:34] [Applause]
[1:25:35] now hearing is not just what you do
[1:25:37] listen to me hearing is not just what
[1:25:40] you're doing right now through your ears
[1:25:42] because let me say this you can be deaf
[1:25:44] and be able to read the word of God and
[1:25:46] you're still hearing the word of God
[1:25:50] and you can have full perfect hearing
[1:25:52] and be deaf to the word of God and not
[1:25:55] hear it at all
[1:25:57] so how do we become the word brother man
[1:25:59] by hearing Faith cometh by hearing and
[1:26:04] hearing of the word of God so what
[1:26:07] brings rapturing Faith hearing the word
[1:26:10] of God why do we cover even some of
[1:26:12] these things that we've covered here
[1:26:13] just in the last 15 minutes about the
[1:26:15] ministry of the son of man that it was
[1:26:17] that it's essential it is Paramount it's
[1:26:21] essential that you see that this message
[1:26:23] that you believe is not just something
[1:26:26] that you lay upon a shelf it's not
[1:26:28] something that you just come and confess
[1:26:30] and profess that you're a Believer but
[1:26:33] you've got to eat it you've got to
[1:26:35] consume it it's got to become you the
[1:26:38] bride has become the church is becoming
[1:26:40] the bride all the time by believing the
[1:26:42] word of God
[1:26:43] he says there in our quote that we read
[1:26:45] in in in in in the ladies in church age
[1:26:48] as she nears her headstone becoming like
[1:26:51] him through the word how do we become
[1:26:53] like him through the word
[1:26:58] and it's so amazing to me I'm just going
[1:27:01] to going to going to say this it's so
[1:27:04] amazing to me how when you preach these
[1:27:07] things
[1:27:08] and you display those things
[1:27:13] and I want to be very very careful how
[1:27:15] we say this because I believe we're all
[1:27:17] believers here but it's so amazing how
[1:27:19] people
[1:27:20] the nature of a Believer can sort of
[1:27:23] tune out
[1:27:25] and I'm I'm giving you the word
[1:27:28] I'm not just giving you the word I'm
[1:27:30] giving you your word
[1:27:31] I'm giving you your message
[1:27:34] I'm giving you your message I'm giving

[1:27:42] just wrote some notes here even just
[1:27:44] leading up to knowing I was going to be
[1:27:45] preaching this morning and some some of

[1:30:57] it
[1:30:57] the Lord just just burned me burned me
[1:31:00] up with just something so simple here
[1:31:03] for Sunday morning if I say nothing else
[1:31:05] and I just say this then I'll know I've
[1:31:07] delivered my thought
[1:31:10] how many of you I'll go back to it how
[1:31:13] many of us have our own personal copy of
[1:31:15] the church age book
[1:31:17] that our faces in this
[1:31:21] have we de-emphasized
[1:31:24] not deified
[1:31:27] but have we de-emphasized
[1:31:29] the voice of God's prophet
[1:31:33] to the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:31:37] let me go further and just tell you
[1:31:38] exactly the way the Lord spoke to me
[1:31:42] in a day an hour
[1:31:44] where there's a perversion of the of of
[1:31:47] of of of of a doctrine that would say
[1:31:50] shut up and push play
[1:31:52] in the face of that here's what I say
[1:31:55] push play

[1:32:03] time to push play oh my brother it's
[1:32:05] right now

[1:32:25] your life how do we expect to defeat the
[1:32:29] onslaught of the devil on our minds in
[1:32:34] mind Warfare
[1:32:36] in an age of anxiety and stress and
[1:32:40] depression and fear how do we expect to
[1:32:43] be exempt from the spirits that have
[1:32:46] been released and permeated upon this
[1:32:48] generation if we're not using the sword
[1:32:51] that God gave us to fight the devil with
[1:32:55] I just want to remind you this is your
[1:32:58] sword
[1:33:00] you say brother Matt you're not holding
[1:33:02] up your Bible That's because I can hold
[1:33:03] up both of them and say this is your
[1:33:05] sword and it's a perversion to try to
[1:33:08] separate these two
[1:33:11] amen it's a perversion from the devil to
[1:33:15] try to get you to separate the two you
[1:33:17] can't separate the word from the word
[1:33:20] it's the word that you've been you know
[1:33:22] it may not be your word but not to say

[1:38:24] subconsciously
[1:38:26] to Facebook Instagram Snapchat be real
[1:38:29] Tick Tock YouTube
[1:38:31] because a lot of y'all said oh yeah I'm
[1:38:34] I'm free I didn't have to raise my hand

[1:38:46] how many times have you tuned into that
[1:38:48] and felt fearful anxious don't you
[1:38:51] realize that the thing that you're
[1:38:53] trying to defeat your feeding
[1:38:57] do we realize as Believers we can become
[1:39:00] just like the rest of the world anxious
[1:39:03] fearful stressed worried
[1:39:07] troubled
[1:39:08] depressed suicidal you say brother Matt
[1:39:11] real Believers real Believers can get to
[1:39:13] that place
[1:39:15] but I promised you it never comes as the
[1:39:18] result of fellowshipping with the word
[1:39:21] [Applause]
[1:39:23] it never comes as the result of
[1:39:25] fellowshipping with the Lord and having
[1:39:27] your lives and Harmony in tune with the
[1:39:28] Holy Spirit it always comes from in
[1:39:31] putting and feeding on the very thing
[1:39:34] you're wanting victory and I want to get
[1:39:36] over it and I want I want over my
[1:39:38] depression then I say stop feeding your
[1:39:40] depression and start feeding the word of
[1:39:43] God start putting the word of God in
[1:39:45] your mouth confessing what the word says
[1:39:47] sharing what the prophet of God says
[1:39:51] it's time and I want to make this I just
[1:39:54] want to keep coming back to it to make
[1:39:56] sure I don't finish and feel like I
[1:39:58] didn't say what the Lord told me to say
[1:40:00] if there was ever a time to push play
[1:40:03] now
[1:40:06] and I'm not going to allow the devil to
[1:40:08] take a person who's taken that totally
[1:40:10] in perversion and and gone the wrong way
[1:40:13] with it God help them God delivered them
[1:40:16] from that evil demon spirit
[1:40:18] but I'm not going to allow that
[1:40:20] scarecrow to keep me out of my
[1:40:22] inheritance
[1:40:23] because when I listen to God's Prophet
[1:40:25] I'm hearing my inheritance this is how I
[1:40:29] fight my battles
[1:40:30] this is how I get victory in my life
[1:40:33] this is how I I free myself of anxiety
[1:40:36] and stress when I'm worried I turn to
[1:40:39] the word when I'm fearful I turn to the
[1:40:42] only thing that's absolute in my life I
[1:40:45] turn to the only thing that's sure
[1:40:47] that's unchanging
[1:40:50] I turn to the word
[1:40:52] Ezekiel 33 verse 11 say unto them as I
[1:40:55] live saith the Lord God Ezekiel 33 verse
[1:40:58] 11. say unto them as I say I have no
[1:41:01] pleasure in the death of the wicked but
[1:41:03] that the wicked turn from his way and
[1:41:07] live
[1:41:09] Ezekiel 33 verse 11.
[1:41:13] and he says say to them eyes I live
[1:41:15] saith the Lord God I have no pleasure in
[1:41:18] the death of the wicked
[1:41:19] but that the wicked turn from his way
[1:41:22] and
[1:41:24] live
[1:41:26] if God wants the wicked to live how much
[1:41:30] more does he want his children and his
[1:41:33] family to live

[1:43:27] stays the book that's open in the hands
[1:43:29] of the angel

[1:43:34] if you don't consume it if you don't eat
[1:43:38] it if you don't if it's not your daily
[1:43:40] bread and your daily portion if you're

[1:43:51] you a prophet and it wasn't his words it
[1:43:53] was the words from the Throne of God
[1:43:55] given to the words of the mouth of a
[1:43:58] prophet but you've got to not just hear

[1:44:35] the message of the hour to say here's
[1:44:38] here Lord here's this problem in the
[1:44:41] world that I see today and I know and I
[1:44:43] believe that the answer has already been
[1:44:47] given
[1:44:48] if there was ever a time to not just be
[1:44:51] coming to church hearing a preacher
[1:44:53] preach the word that's wonderful that's
[1:44:56] good there's a time for Fellowship
[1:44:58] there's a time to come to the house of
[1:44:59] God and hear the word of God but if
[1:45:01] there was ever a time where the were the
[1:45:03] Bride of Jesus Christ needs to say give
[1:45:07] me the word Lord
[1:45:09] it's now
[1:45:12] and you say man you believe it this
[1:45:14] morning
[1:45:15] if there was ever a Time
[1:45:19] to be able to discern the truth from the
[1:45:23] LIE
[1:45:24] and that's a voice that Satan speaks to
[1:45:26] you he gives you the voice of Lies but
[1:45:30] God gives you the Voice of Truth and if
[1:45:33] there was ever a time to use the voice
[1:45:35] of Truth God gave you
[1:45:38] to silence the LIE of the devil it's
[1:45:41] right now my brother and my sister
[1:45:43] if there was ever a time where a people
[1:45:46] needs to have spiritual discernment and
[1:45:50] be equipped
[1:45:54] to do spiritual warfare
[1:45:57] it's right now

[1:46:22] many words as I can to get you to
[1:46:23] understand how how practical I am today

[1:51:16] this later those that are alive
[1:51:18] listening in
[1:51:21] but we take just a moment in
[1:51:24] evaluate
[1:51:26] say what am I fitting on
[1:51:28] what I come to church and I hear the
[1:51:30] word of God being preached but really am
[1:51:32] I really consuming the word
[1:51:35] am I really on a daily basis
[1:51:39] come on be honest friends let's be
[1:51:41] honest with each other
[1:51:42] [Music]
[1:51:44] are we hearing or are we content that
[1:51:47] we've heard
[1:51:49] and everything the Lord wants to say
[1:51:50] he's already spoken and I'm a Believer
[1:51:52] in that that's enough no the Lord the
[1:51:54] holy spirit is still wanting to speak
[1:51:57] he's still wanting to fellowship and I
[1:52:00] just want to raise a hand and say Lord
[1:52:02] let me always
[1:52:03] make myself available to you when you
[1:52:06] want to Fellowship Lord then I just want
[1:52:09] to fellowship with you
[1:52:11] I want to open every door Lord in my
[1:52:13] heart and let you come in
[1:52:17] I don't just want to hear it Lord with
[1:52:20] my ears I want to
[1:52:23] hear it in my heart
[1:52:25] I want that word to Echo
[1:52:27] [Music]
[1:52:29] when I'm in a moment of Temptation let
[1:52:33] that word Echo out from my heart oh God
[1:52:36] when I'm in a moment in a fearful
[1:52:38] situation
[1:52:40] and I don't have the answer and I don't
[1:52:42] know what to do let me remember
[1:52:45] I just gotta look to the rock of my
[1:52:48] salvation
[1:52:49] as David said when my heart is
[1:52:50] overwhelmed lead me to a rock that is
[1:52:53] higher than I and you've given us that
[1:52:55] sure word that rock of our Salvation
[1:52:58] you've given it to us Lord when I'm in a
[1:53:00] moment Lord and I feel like oh
[1:53:02] everything's collapsing let me say give
[1:53:05] me the word oh God let me look to
[1:53:07] the word
[1:53:09] hurts the word Lord that
[1:53:11] changes
[1:53:13] word Lord that sets free
[1:53:16] the word that gives faith
[1:53:19] the word that changes men's hearts and
[1:53:21] leads them to repentance it's not an
[1:53:24] emotion it's not just a not just a a
[1:53:27] disciplined academic study it's not that
[1:53:31] Lord you didn't send it for that
