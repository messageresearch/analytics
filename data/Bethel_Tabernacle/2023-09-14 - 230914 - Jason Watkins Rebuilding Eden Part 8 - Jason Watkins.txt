the commune you know not just to hear it here but how many want to say Lord let me not just hear it here let me hear it right here God let me hear that voice amen behind the voice let me be sensitive to that let's invite our pastor to come touching Jesus is all that matters birthday then your life will never be the same there's only one way to touching just believe just believe when you call on

forth the word of God God bless you all greach in the name of the Lord gonna invite you to Philippians chapter 3. I want to go right to the word of God sure enjoy all that singing and worship every time amen praise the Lord just enough gets back to my office to make me feel jealous but blessed at the same time amen amen sometimes I'd like to be out here amen enjoying it amen but I can enjoy it back there to a degree amen God bless you Philippians chapter 3 we're trusting the Lord tonight to continue uh in rebuilding Eden this is part eight it's not was not my intention actually um to preach uh to continue this series tonight I had actually went to bed last night with another thought in mind and woke up um with that same thought and then went to study and Lord just wouldn't have it so we're going to carry on tonight amen praise the Lord want you to be praying for me I'll be ministering away in Colombia this weekend the meetings there in Swansea brother Benny Perry and uh the various churches in that area so you'd be praying for me can I count on you to do that amen praise the Lord if you want to come up Friday and Saturday and visit drop in on the meetings I think we posted the flyer amen but make sure you're here at your posted Duty on Sunday morning Amen brother Matt I'll be covering base for me praise the Lord um Philippians chapter 3 verses 10 through 19 will will let you uh actually we're just going to read 1011 and then I'll let you be seated and then we'll finish reading with you seated um Philippians 3 verse 10 my favorite passage in the Bible but I may know him and the power of his resurrection and the fellowship of his sufferings being made conformable unto his death love verse 11 if I love verse 10 but 11 is what really adds a real Finishing Touch to to the 10th verse if by any means I might attain unto the resurrection of the Dead for a little more clarity the NLT reads that so that one way or another I will experience the resurrection from the dead one way or another whatever it takes I want to know him and the power of his resurrection now that's two different things there there's a conjunction it's not knowing in the power although brother Branham used it that way there's an application of that but he also brother Branham also preached it just like it's written I want to know him and the power of his resurrection and the fellowship of his sufferings being made conformable unto his death so that one way or another I will experience the resurrection from the dead let's pray father we thank you for your word tonight and I thank you for this opportunity Lord to stand here and come under your anointing Lord to minister the gospel I pray you be with me Lord God having having been all day Lord considering this material it's all new it's all fresh I was forced to write completely new notes for this eighth part Lord and what was going to be part eight has now been moved to part nine and part 10 is waiting Lord and so we're just looking to you tonight commit myself into your hands Lord in Jesus name amen God bless you as you're seated and keep your Bibles ready we're going to continue reading because now beginning in verse 12 we come to what what what probably is in your Bible there might be a chapter notation there this is the part where Paul begins to talk about the High Calling of God now that High Calling our first thing I want you to get in your Minds tonight this is a Monumental point because this is really an anchor point if I could say that to everything I've been constantly preaching in the previous seven parts you've heard me say again and again that this whole series is primarily to believers hey man I'm it's primarily to people who testify that they have given their heart to Christ they testify that they have been filled with the Holy Spirit they testify that they have set Amen to every word if that's you then this series is for you amen because it is the Believers that have been called to the High Calling of God we know that brother Branham said only the predestinated are considered in Redemption and since Redemption uh is is what we're after uh then you can see certainly that election then is based on uh you know it's genealogy it's the gene seed of almighty God a true election don't ever forget that true election is based on Origin as Jesus said I you know he the Bible said Jesus knowing that he came from God and went to God Amen and so we realize that the great principle of the High Calling of God now you believers do you feel the High Calling do you feel the challenge of the High Calling upon you listen you don't have to you you don't look at the High Calling as somewhere in outer space that you just you just want to give up on you say I'm just got too many problems and I'll never a high calling are you kidding I can barely Hang On Now understand that the world has fallen so far under you you're in the High Calling if you're standing so how many are standing as a Believer say I've got weaknesses I have ups and downs I do have problems but I'm still standing then you are living in the High Calling see it's really the high calling is really part and parcel of the great principle of spiritual warfare that is in fact what spiritual warfare is all about what spiritual warfare all about Pastor the high calling and you achieving that position not living under your privileges as sons of God you're not warring very successfully if you're if you don't have access to the all the power of God because I'm here to tell you it's for you it is you you can have it all it takes is war with the love of God in your heart amen now so Paul goes on to say echoing what I've just said not as though I had already attained either we're already perfect amen where's my verse on the screen guys yeah verse 12. amen not as though I had already attained either were already perfect but I follow after how many paulins we got here tonight say like Paul said I uh Paul amen Paul you're you're you're speaking my language brother I I I don't I I I not as though I had already attained either or were already perfect but I follow after if that I may apprehend that for which also I am apprehended why do you why are why are you following because Christ has apprehended me to the high calling and I don't think I've quite reached my perfection but I'm fighting the fight of faith this is what's important verse 13 Brethren I count not myself to have apprehended but this one thing I do I can't get I can't do a whole lot but I got one thing I can do I can defeat the Devil how are you going to defeat him forgetting those things which are behind I have failures well I I'm not sure I have because I've forgotten them say if you ever failed I don't know I don't really remember it say well you're you're insane you kind of Amen I'm just believing God's word and and and although in my flesh I don't necessarily feel but here's what I can do I can forget what is behind and I and when I do that when I forget what is behind then reaching forth unto those things which are before maybe I didn't meet the grade yesterday but it's ahead of me for today it's ahead of me again for tomorrow his mercies are new every morning Hallelujah see if if the devil could have one success and it would be to bring you to church tonight just to keep you in the failures of yesterday if he can do that all my preaching is worthless because you because the word has to be mixed with faith see in them that hear it so Paul says what do I do see I reach forth unto those things which are before I press that means stretch that means strain that means you know I press toward I'm reaching as far as I can toward the mark for the prize of the High Calling of God in Christ Jesus you know the beauty of it is is that because that the predestinated only the only the predestinated are considered in Redemption then then because that I have been redeemed then then then I uniquely have the ability to make the mark say how do you do you know you'll make it well I know I can I know it's for me I know he has supplied me see I know he won't push me through a pipe he won't push me through a mold and just pull me out and say what a wonderful Overcomer I gotta fight where how many are willing to fight tonight and say I want everything in my inheritance see so let us therefore as many as be perfect be thus minded see he just admitted he wasn't perfect In the Flesh so now he's admitting that we are perfect in Christ let us therefore as many as be perfect be thus minded and if anything you otherwise you are you'll be otherwise minded God shall reveal even this to you what a statement of Grace Paul is saying if you disagree well you know if you if you have a hard time believing what I'm telling you about yourself God will make it plain breathe it'll be all right God will make it plain I'll keep telling you that you're the Flawless spotless bride of Jesus Christ until you believe it amen because you're going to see the effects of believing it here in a minute see nevertheless we're in two we have already attained that's an important verse it's a super important we're going to break down verse 16 just in a little bit so be ready getting in a little bit after you take the scripture down I'm going to need that 16th verse again now watch real close verse 16 nevertheless believers bride elect lady redeemed predestinated right nevertheless where unto we have already attained let us walk by the same rule let us mind the same thing see the NLT says we must hold on to the progress we have already made so don't Don't Drift don't slide back you understand now here's an interesting thing about backsliding if you if you because the world is moving toward more and more sin every day and moving toward more and more Insanity every day moving to more and more toward perversion every day so so it's it's moving brother Branham said it's it's it's headed for a destruction you can't stop it you can't turn it around you can't even slow it down the world is moving now get on a moving treadmill uh and and I'm here to tell you if you don't walk you'll go backwards understand so you don't have to run out here to The Honky Tonk to backslide just stop cut your prayer life in half cut your church attendance in half just stop doing spiritual things and you'll bless you'll slide backwards because the world is moving toward evil so you have to press you have to constantly constantly go forward go forward go forward see for many walk verse 18. see verse 17 brethren be followers together of me and mark them which walks so as you see as you have us for an example I'm so glad Paul could say that he was an example to the church for many of whom I have told you often and now tell you even weeping that they are the enemies of the Cross of Christ who's in this destruction whose God is their belly and whose glory is in their shame who mind Earthly things you know what they stop doing they stop pressing see you know this is such a description of today who have become enemies of the Cross whose end is destruction whose God is their own belly and whose glory is their own shame who mind Earthly things I mean that's why you know I'm you know I'll just tell you you remember several Services ago and we showed some different musical artists on the screen over here we showed Hillsong particularly you know I really was very kind I was actually very kind and and and didn't Linger on it I could have really brought forth you know I I'm not a newsman I'm a preacher but I but I I could have brought forth almost a documentary level uh of a debauchery among that Hillsong movement if you would if you would ever study the Hillsong churches I mean at this point so many of them had to close down because of the failures of all their leadership and their and their pastors and they they started in Australia and and then that Pastor the founder he had a big fall and then the man that they set up in New York and I mean it's it's so bad that I couldn't show it because this man as the pastor actively I'm not talking about after he got caught in the sack with another woman I'm talking about before that while he's the active Pastor he's hanging out with rock stars he's drinking tequila at the bars he cusses jams out with with rock bands walks around in such vulgar clothing in public and the people loved him he was considered the Superstar Pastor in America and on you you could see interviews of him on on the on the major news channels he was like a Phenom and I mean he actually he he's so gross and so vulgar and so nasty and such an ungodly sinner and I'm just calling the fruit I'm calling the tree by the fruit that he literally makes Joel Osteen look like a Cub Scout I'll take I'll take 10 Joel Osteen's instead of one of this guy so I'm just making a point friends that because you we said in a message church and you're somewhat sheltered from the world you ought to thank God that we had a Godly messenger who came in this day and he never fell to money or to women or to popularity and there was never an accusation against him a man who stayed clean in his life and humble before God and God manifested and you're the you're the result of that Ministry I've never been so happy to be a result of anything in my life I was showing you some of the results of that movement but this movement has produced the life of Jesus Christ don't be fooled friends the modern world of so-called Christianity is vulgar nasty and rotten gross see and I I don't hardly have enough words I could borrow a few Bible descriptions their tables are full of vomit they're fine they're they're they're harlots their mother's a say that's true man you're turning the air blue I'm just quoting the Bible that's all I'm doing don't lose sight of how blessed you are don't lose sight about glad you ought to be don't lose sight that you are know the truth and the truth has made you free well don't apologize for that that's the that's the flat truth that's the truth the world needs to hear they don't need to hear a watered down gospel they need to hear they're headed to a tribulation unless they repent the eighth part tonight this eighth installment in this series is all about this great principle of spiritual warfare for the believer we've been zeroing in on the what I consider to be the greatest existential threat to the true church of the last days and that is the Antichrist impersonation of Christianity within the framework of the Christian church see this is the threat we face don't think that that Antichrist Spirit of impersonation doesn't try to weed in Among Us he'll come right into your home right into your life if you let him the next thing you know you'll be you'll find yourself living with carnality and on the edge and you you you barely look like a a reformed sinner so he dress in ways that are absolutely contrary to the quotes on tape absolutely contrary to the quotes has anybody does does anybody remember that William Branham was against women painting their fingernails does anybody remember that does anybody remember that he was against women trimming their hair even trimming it do you do you remember that William Branham preached Holiness and women should dress holy and they shouldn't be half naked at the upper part of their body okay men shouldn't run around in shorts you shouldn't carouse and run around and and hang out with the wrong crowds because what will happen is you run with dogs you catch fleas see and I'm not speaking about people who can come to Christ I'm like God I would that all the whole world would come to Salvation I have that in my heart I preach I wish every man and woman would fall down on their knees tonight and repent and let Christ come into their life brother Branham said the Millennium could be on tomorrow if we do that so I I reject the ideology that I'm against people or that I shouldn't say hard things you should know I reject that kind of an idea I have the right to preach the bare-fisted gospel I believe it I live it and I have a right to minister it amen it's the plain truth the soul brother Adam talks about tight clothes and short skirts and you know if you're going to be a Christian then be one amen so we've been zeroing in on this great existential threat of the impersonation I call it the Antichrist impersonation of Christianity that's what brother Branham is going to refer to it as here in a minute so remember that we're not looking at it as a threat and I'm not preaching and this series isn't about looking at it as a threat to the false Church because the because the false church is just that it's false meaning it's not a real one there is only one real Church and that's the Holy Ghost Field Church that's it it's not it's so it's so so the false church is not the actual Body of Christ uh it's not the Virgin bride whom he comes to reproduce His Image in do you know that's why you're the Virgin bride of Christ so that he can reproduce His Image through you brother Branham says in the revelation of Jesus Christ and I'm debated whether to put these on the screen being Wednesday I decided against it plus I want to jump in and out of it so just stay right with me this is very familiar but I'm going to make some comments on it as we go so brother Branham says now remember this now pay attention everybody got me now remember this Christ in the true church is a continuation of the book of Acts the very fact that he says two true church shows there's a false one okay so he's got two different churches going here all right he's going to talk about an antichrist church and a Christ Church all right the the Christ in the true church is a continuation of the book of Acts but the Book of Revelation shows how that the Antichrist spirit would come into the church and defile it now watch because it's going to actually end up forming a false Church off of the true church you can you know it's the false Church by the by the characteristics he said he'll defile it making it lukewarm formal and Powerless the true church with the Holy Ghost is not lukewarm or formal or powerless the true church is a continuation of the book of Acts see it exposes The Book of Revelation it exposes Satan revealing his works now here is his Works ready attempted destruction of God's people and the discrediting of God's word you understand so my my my my my my uh concern is not for the false Church my concern is what he's trying to do to God's people and God's word he's trying to destroy God's people by discrediting God's word that's how he'll destroy you if he can discredit God's word in your mind if he can get you to look at a quote of William Branham and discredit that in your mind he will destroy you you are fortified behind the word of God see so it's discredited in God's word he does it right down to the time he has cast into the Lake of Fire so just plan to fight to the Finish Line come on friends you have to fight to the Finish Line now you'll be no vacations we're not getting any time off you have to fight to the Finish Line I just say Lord then bring on the Finish Line bring on the fight Hallelujah he fights that see Revelations he fights it he cannot stand it he knows that if the people now this is the true bride you can see by the characteristics remember the characteristics identify the false church lukewar and formal and Powerless now he's going to identify the true bride see Satan cannot stand Revelation he knows that if the people the true bride get the true Revelation because she's the only one who can the true revelation of the true church and what she is now I'm gonna I'm gonna make you go along with me on this you ready if the true bride gets the true revelation of the true church and what she is Who You Are Who You Are if the true bride gets a true revelation of the true church and who you are if you can understand who the true church is and who you are what she stands for what you stand for how many know what we stand for do you realize that Faith a revelation of who you are and what we stand for is what defeats the devil and that she you can do the Greater Works she you will be an invincible Army Hallelujah if they we get a true revelation of the two Spirits within the framework of the Christian church and by God's spirit catch it and by God's spirit discern and withstand the Antichrist Spirit if we discern and withstand the Antichrist Spirit if we discern and withstand the Antichrist Spirit then Satan will be powerless before her Satan will be powerless before us Satan he'll be powerless before me say he'll be powerless before me because God only needs one person he Satan will be as definitely thwarted today as when Christ withstood his every effort to gain power over him in the desert yes Satan hates revelation and now brother Branham does it for us I don't have to do it Satan hates Revelation but we love it with true Revelation in our lives the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against us but we will prevail over them demon power Gates of Hell demon power say how many demons all of them all of them I have given you power over all the power of the devil Hallelujah so can you now see the danger you see what I'm preaching on see we've got to discern and withstand now you're all you're almost having it done for you because you've got faithful Ministry who are gifted to rightly divide the word and we're following a prophet's message so I I promise you you can rely on what you're hearing we're pointing things to you to avoid yes you say oh you're just meddling in our lives trying to tell us how to live no kidding it's what I do that's what I do it's what you pay me for you pay me to hurt you I'm sorry your money's not worth it to me to for the pain I go through hurting you but it's a duty before God so now you can see why tonight is part eight and parts nine and ten are waiting in the wings now watch now when when brother Branham was shown a preview of The Bride you remember that and he saw the true the the true church and then he saw you know the the churches from America Church from all over the world and it's got worse and worse and worse till it got to the last which was uh the Church of America and that was the most horrible of them all which makes sense because the lightning traveled from these to the west and it's all heaped up right here see so so we we find that when he was shown a preview of The Bride you remember when the bride came around he they said the now the bride must because brother Brandon was so destroyed over looking at the church and he said goodness all my preaching and all my brother and all of us ministers and all the revivals and he thought of Africa and he thought of India and he thought of Scandinavian countries and he seven times around the world and oh my goodness and and this is the best we could do he said I was embarrassed I didn't want to look he said he was standing right here and he said I was so embarrassed to think this is the best we could offer him uh a church naked following a witch dancing to rock and roll and that's the best that we could offer and he was so destroyed and he said that voice said now the bride must come in to review again because the lightning from the East is now in the West and then when the bride comes along and brother Branham said saintly bunch of little girls smooth clean all of them had long hair down their back all of them dressed decently said beautiful clean they weren't all filled full of Max Factor and and all kinds of makeup trying to make them beautiful they had the beauty of holiness but brother Branham noticed two or three right at the end time right the last Representatives and they were getting out of Step see and so brother Branham observed that the great threat to the Bride of the last age at the end of the line was that she allowed herself to get out of Step by watching that false Church what he says he said she she got to watching that false church and saw them going into destruction and she got gazing at that and the things you you you're transformed into what you gaze at that's scripture the things you gaze at you get transformed into that it it affects you and they got they got gazing at that and they ended up you know they they they they right right near at the end of the line allowing herself to get out of Step watching that false church and she almost like began to you know it's almost like it looks like the true church has got little fringes of wow or are are believers trying to pattern after the false Church what I thought we were believers I thought we didn't dress like that and act like that and go to those places and do those things I thought Believers had a different standard I thought Believers didn't compromise like that false Church see the display of lewdness and vulgarity and nakedness of the false Church driven by evil spirits that that brother Branham said it's evil spirits that teach women to strip their clothes off men too men too I mean that Pastor I was telling you about has a picture where he's in shorts and no shirt but I I couldn't show it because it is so unbelievably vulgar it made me blush and I'm a dude it made me blush and I and I and I felt incense that he called himself a minister of the Gospel because I gotta face that out here and people go oh what do you do I'm a preacher oh boy hey don't don't associate me with that or that kind of stuff's going straight to the Lake of Fire we have nothing to do with that kind of stuff we believe in Holiness under God cheap brother Branham said it's like like Legion in the Bible Legion stripped his clothes off of him so that's an evil spirit sister brother brother sister that's an evil spirit driving you to show Too Much flesh that's an evil spirit says hiking those skirts up that's an evil spirit brother for walking around in those shorts that's an evil spirit that's an evil spirit Brothers to have bangs hanging down in your face brother Brandon said that's a spirit that's a feminist Spirit you might be as manly as all get out but there's a feminist Spirit working see so the worldly and and so that that lewdness that nakedness of the false church that vulgarity the worldly rhythm of the false Church which brother Branham you remember in 1964 in Shalom brother Branham attributes it to to Lifestyles that don't move in harmony with the original composer he talks about sympathy and Symphony and I I'll read you the the statement here in a second so this this worldly Rhythm there brother Branham said you know they're moving and they're dancing and they got their music going and you know and and these are supposed to be lives it's representing the false church and they're supposed to have lives that are in sympathetic Harmony they're in sympathetic resonance with the with the conductor how he wrote brother Brown said this is the sheet music and the and and and the conductor wrote it like he wants it played but this isn't something that these guys get on and do this is something all of you do you're an instrument you this is sheet music that you play in your lives amen and so this was the problem they they had their lives were so you know Lifestyles born of of insincere repentance towards God and you know join the church and shake the preacher's hand that's all you need to do but effective change and Holiness simply aren't necessary Asiana Christ Church brother Brandon says in shalom can't you see my brother's sister it's got to be in harmony the director has got to be with the word when it says one thing don't say something else it'll give the wrong sign then when the whole thing goes out of rhythm that's right God's word is a great and brother Brandon says God's word is a great sympathy a symphony rather he keeps interchanging it we've preached on that before it's the Holy Spirit using both words on purpose and he says You must begin like he did in the music you must begin with him notice get in the rhythm of it see it's a holy ghost rhythm that makes you love God and keep his word and your whole life is a life of Christianity your whole life is like Jesus your attitudes are like Jesus you're you're playing the sheet music you're in harmony with him see you say well I joined church that's not the Rhythm I did so that's not the Rhythm I went up to the Altar and I said I believe Jesus is the son of God Satan does the same thing that's not the Rhythm see you're out of Swing what happened maybe some director told you shake hands and put your name on the book join our club or our organization you're all out of Swing come on man you need to get with the swing you're you're out of swing with the word of God so so you know then then there was the fact that that the false Church wasn't marching to the beat of the Gospel they were dancing to Modern worldly music see and this all began affecting the marching order of the true church which was paying too much attention to it you remember when we talked about even John there in the Book of Revelation and when he saw the Beast system and the and he said I admired her it had my I marveled greatly and the angel was standing there's a John are you marveling that God sent a prophet he had a prophetic tour guide who said I will show you the revelation of her that she hates Christ don't don't Marvel after her don't don't get transfixed with this world this world's going to Ash and send her we got another world coming see so this began affecting their marching order they they they were getting out of step with the original sheet music the true church say wow you know I've heard preachers say good grief if you're if you're preaching clothesline Ministry if you're preaching clothesline sermons about how we should live and talk and dress and everything you're not preaching to the mature bride I beg your pardon that's that's nonsense that's just that's probably a preacher that likes it like that so he can live however he wants to live I'm here to tell you something friends we will never stop preaching old-fashioned holiness some of the most profound mystery preaching comes across this Pulpit but we also have a gear that says we need to walk right and live right and look right and act right see so this was the true church that brother Branham saw getting out of Step this was true believers so I'm not preaching to the world this is this whole series is to True Believers you you must not get out of Step watching that other system I want to say that I feel like I want to say it five times you must not get out of Step as a Believer patterning after the false impersonation of Christianity say well but I I'm not doing that then why then why are then why do I see certain people dressing the way they do acting the way they do going where they shouldn't go doing what they shouldn't do then why do I see that if it's not affecting you I'm not saying you're not a believer I'm not saying you're not a child of God I'm saying you've been mesmerized by the Antichrist see a great tool that Satan uses in the modern day is to present himself as a modern Christian preacher that's a great tool in his hand who teaches and sets examples that that you and you know and sets the example that that you can modernize the word and water it down make it more tolerable you know make it more of a tolerable teaching make it easier to live you know because it allows for a compromising approach towards biblical Christianity that and I I want to come to one more point because I'm determined to stop at 8 30. I've been going too long on Wednesdays but I'm I want to get to this one that old-fashioned standards and morals and holiness you know the the the false Church basically has the position and you can see it by the way they live I can look right at it and I know that that that the old-fashioned uh old-fashioned standards of morals and Holiness are not observed and as far as they're concerned they don't need to be observed because their belief is God is a god of love and he loves you just as he as you are and he he doesn't mind if you stay just as you are well that's a false Doctrine God does love no matter where he finds you he loves you but he he he doesn't save you to leave you where you are he saves you to change everything about you if you if you didn't if you didn't need changing you wouldn't need saving see so can I take up for the old-fashioned gospel just for a minute is that okay I just want to take up for the old-fashioned gospel with my last few minutes you know we teach uh that godliness and morals and holiness are part of the love of God see I don't I don't say God just is God just has so much love he doesn't care I don't really need to change because he's a god of love but what what the real true church teaches is that godliness and morals and Holiness are actually part of the love of God because he loves you too much to leave you in ungodliness and amoral he loves you too much to do that see so the teaching of Godly morals and standards being encapsulated uh within God's love I want to say this to you tonight that is not a new revelation that's not just some end time Revelation concocted by a Kentucky hillbilly I want to say it again the teaching of Godly morals and standards being encapsulated within God's love is not a new revelation in fact is it's not something that came to the earth and the time of the Gospels it did not even in the days of Jesus when he went about doing good that that Godly morals and Holiness uh Holiness standards are that they are embedded in the love of God is actually part of an eternal teaching so the Eternal teaching of standards and Holiness I'm just trying to really I'm just rephrasing it because I really want this to stick this is like my whole sermon tonight is almost based on this statement that the Eternal teaching of of the standards of Holiness within God's love is actually found in the Eden story going all the way back to Genesis so if you if you call me old-fashioned you have no idea if you call me old-fashioned you have no idea this thing goes all the way back to the Eden story in Genesis see so holiness morality and living separated lives unto God why it says it's a teaching As Old As It Gets to let people say what they want but I'm believing the the the teaching that's as old as it gets search the record go all the way back to page one and I'm standing and it's all through the Bible see so so call me old-fashioned thank you it's a great compliment it warms my heart if that's what you see me as oh I I mean that if that's what you notice about me then praise God I must be doing something right G-Man verse 16 again because here's the breakdown I want to do on the 16th verse nevertheless wherein to we have already attained let us walk by the same rule let us mind the same thing uh in other words we must hold on to the progress we have already made so Paul is just eliminating that you that you kind of get a hole in his vacation that you only have to be holy at church time and in the week you can kind of do whatever you want Holiness is a way of life it's a lifestyle it's not a diet it's a lifestyle morals and high value and Faith these kinds of things are part of the kingdom of God so so a breakdown you know now now a breakdown and and I want to say that this is not just me playing on words what I'm about to say is not just a word play all right consider the prophetic Bible reference to the terms former and latter rain all right so the former latter rain you know we properly assign descriptive terms such as the former rain and the latter rain and when we're describing this prophecy which the former latter rain is a prophecy concerning the movement of God upon his family across time all right it's a movement of God upon his family across time a former reign of Latter rain all right so so we so then we properly assign descriptive terms such as the former and the latter you know where it's it's it's actually common in human language for the very purpose of context all right so when we describe things that are our former then what we're meaning is is something older or in the past all right and and things that are latter to mean things that are newer or more recent and that's just for the purposes of context we pick up our Bible and we say we have an Old Testament and we differentiate the Old Testament from the New Testament to differentiate between the writings again over time all right but more perfectly speaking more perfectly speaking God's word can never actually be old-fashioned because God's word is eternal you get me see as Eternal it actually can never be old that's why brother Brandon would say every thought God has ever had he has always had he can never have a new thought because every thought he has he has always had all right so I'm trying not to blow fuses tonight I'm just trying to keep this this simple so the word of God is eternal it can never be old so it it can never be owed all it can be is original or not original you got me so this is exactly why the spirit of God never anointed his Elijah prophet of of of this day to to to preach a sermon the spoken word is the old seed he told him preach the spoken word is the Original Seed not the old seed see there's nothing old or old-fashioned about the word of God because it's the same yesterday in the past as it is today in the present and it will remain unchanged in the future for as many tomorrows as there will ever be and when all tomorrows are in the past that's a twister when all tomorrows are in the past the word will still be being lived out yeah when the books are closed for the last time the word will still be being lived out it's an eternal word it's not old-fashioned it's not a new gospel it's the original word The Original Seed see God's word with all of its principles will still remain they will still be true they will still be relevant they will still be enforced even when the books are closed for the last time his word will be believed throughout eternity so so brother Jason how did you end up going down that rabbit path because I started out by showing you that the teaching of Godly morals are encapsulated within the in the love of God and that's not a new revelation so the message of the hour is not something new it's just a restoration of the original everything we believe in Holiness that were given to us by Elijah the early church believed and and that that sent them and they became part of the first resurrection then you'll become part of the first resurrection scene and so that Godly morals and Holiness are embedded in the love of God is is literally part of the Eternal teaching that goes all the way back as I said into Genesis see now I've got to make this I got to close this this thought out I got two points to make so firstly this what I just broke down for you literally flies in the face of the modern interpretation of God's love because the modern interpretation of God's love separates out morals and Holiness and godliness rather than having that embedded within the love of God amen so first of all it flies right in the face of the modern interpretation it brings the true word of God literally into direct conflict with the message of the modern Church uh about God so loving the world you you're you're in a complete Log Jam the the the modern Church of today cannot really preach correctly about the love of God because their position that they desire to hold can't fit in the love of God see see so so it so it brings the true word indirect and a direct conflict not only uh and it's not only in his teaching but in its practices and in its Lifestyles secondly the word of God being eternal is it the word of God being eternal where there really is no old or new it's just original or not the word of God being eternal invalidates any idea that the teachings of Elijah the prophet in our day and the example he lived and the plain instructions he gave for how we should live they are just as valid in 2023 as they were in 1965. the very fact that the word of God is eternal invalidates any other notion whatever he said however he lived however he'd been plain in plain Kentucky broken English so that you didn't even have to go get a dictionary you can just follow right along because we're simple people and he told us things we shouldn't do in ways we shouldn't dress in places we shouldn't go and it's so clear and it's so plain I'm not saying you have to like cherry pie better than Apple Pie I'm not saying you're you're 22 rifle has to be a Winchester it doesn't okay all right you don't have to drive a Ford but I'll tell you something friends when he went down the line of correct decency and morality how we should conduct ourselves the things that we should and shouldn't participate in all the way down to how we dress and how we act whether that's in church or whether that's in public or even he gave us instructions how to not act in our home even in the privacy of our own homes and I'm going to tell you something friends those teachings those teachings that God sent us through that same messenger that told John don't admire her those teachings were certified you say well they were his opinion his opinions were certified by the angel of the Lord who fellowshipped with him all the time I want to say that again there's things where even brother Branham like Paul Paul would say no I don't I don't I'm not saying Christ you know told me this I don't have a scripture this is what Paul would say said but I think I have the mind of Christ I you know this is me not the Lord and Paul gave his advice do you think you shouldn't follow that you think this because Paul said not me it's just me not the Lord you think he said oh well good I I can scratch that one out you better not you do so to your own peril I'm here to tell you something friends if you disregard the direct teachings that are on the tape and even the opinions of William Brandon for how he lived and how he told you and I to live you do that and you'll do it to your own Peril because I have not shunned to declare unto you the whole gospel of Christ Hallelujah friends I am not shunned to declare unto you the whole counsel of God Hallelujah and God certified that message and that messenger by and presence of the Angel of the Lord and we're not talking about a Gabriel or or a Michael or wormwood we're talking about none other than the Lord Jesus Christ the same one that Moses followed the same one that was a cloud by Tay and a fire by Night the same one that came down and licked up Elijah's offering that same angel of God Walk daily with William Branham and certified his doctrines teachings and opinions and they're good enough for me how about you friend they say they're good enough for me oh let's stand to our feet tonight they're good enough for me I hope they're good enough for you I am not shunned I wrote that down today I felt like I could shout and scream it I have not shunned to declare unto you the whole counsel of God amen hallelujah amen brother man that song um I want to live the way he wants me to live hey gather around come on and gather because we're going to pray I want to sing I don't want to keep you
