[31:35] to say present truth ministries will
[31:37] remain open and missions work will
[31:40] continue to be supported and and we'll
[31:42] continue as the Lord leads uh in the
[31:45] future. Just ask that you'd remember us
[31:48] in prayer. We'll definitely be
[31:49] remembering you all in prayer and
[31:52] &gt;&gt; please please stay in touch.
[31:55] uh we're still, you know, distance is is
[31:58] a thing, but it's uh we can still stay
[32:01] in touch and we're brothers and sisters
[32:04] in Christ. And once again, just thank
[32:08] each and every one of you for your love
[32:10] for for me and for my family. And um God
[32:15] bless you. And I don't like to say
[32:17] goodbye. Um, my I I can always remember
[32:20] growing up, I think I got it from my
[32:22] grandfather when we would leave the
[32:23] cabin or leave his house, he couldn't
[32:25] look at us and say goodbye. I always had
[32:27] to turn his back and just go like this.
[32:31] So, but it's not goodbye for sure.
[32:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[32:35] &gt;&gt; Farewell. We love you all and we'll see
[32:38] you soon. Amen.
[32:41] &gt;&gt; Thank you, brother Jason.
[32:47] [Applause]
[32:48] Amen. So, we're going to continue to uh
[32:51] remember the Demar's family in prayer
[32:53] and um it's not an easy thing, you know,
[32:55] what they're taking on. But, you know,
[32:57] servants of the Lord don't get to decide
[33:00] anything about their life. And I learned
[33:02] that many years ago. They don't get to
[33:04] uh decide where they live, what they do,
[33:07] what they say. They don't even get to
[33:08] decide what they think or feel. They're
[33:11] they're set aside for the service of the
[33:13] Lord and for his family and they are uh
[33:16] reserved unto Christ. And brother Jason
[33:18] and his family have certainly been an
[33:20] example of that to us. Amen. Sister Amy,
[33:23] you going to make us all cry. You keep
[33:25] doing that. But uh you know, I just I
[33:28] just want to say what a lovely addition
[33:30] they've been and will always remain part
[33:33] of the Bethl Tabernacle family. Amen.
[33:38] Amen. uh you know I said uh brother
[33:41] Jason that that that you all will remain
[33:43] friends goes without saying but but I
[33:46] want to say it anyway. Amen. But also
[33:48] beyond that uh the relationship will
[33:51] carry on. You know um when brother Jason
[33:55] and his family relocated here how many
[33:57] years ago Jay?
[33:58] &gt;&gt; Six.
[33:59] &gt;&gt; Six. Uh
[34:01] Bethl Tabernacle did not absorb Present
[34:04] Truth Ministries. That stayed a separate
[34:06] entity. Brother Jason simply relocated
[34:09] his global office here to work out of
[34:11] this church. It's been a great benefit
[34:13] to us. We still had had and have Bethl
[34:17] missions and brother Jason has actually
[34:19] represented us as Bethl missions in the
[34:21] field and we've supported President
[34:23] Truth Ministries and we will continue to
[34:25] do that. I have plans in my heart to
[34:27] continue supporting PTM ministries,
[34:30] especially in mission endeavors. And uh
[34:32] Brother Jason and I, we're talking about
[34:34] tentative plans to um end up in the
[34:36] Middle East somewhere uh if the Lord uh
[34:39] wills it. But we we want to continue to
[34:42] regard them as part of us and and
[34:44] they'll be back here visiting. Brother
[34:46] Jason will be back here ministering that
[34:49] wonderful ministry that we have so
[34:51] enjoyed all these years.
[34:53] &gt;&gt; So, amen. Let's stand to our feet. We
[34:55] want to turn to the word and um at this
[34:59] time, you know, we Hey, the Bible says,
[35:02] you know, here we have no continuing
[35:04] city. But I'm glad we can seek one
[35:07] that's coming. Amen. Whose builder and
[35:09] maker is God and their time and distance
[35:12] will be a moot point. It'll be relative.
[35:15] Have no meaning, no bearing on us at
[35:17] all. And I'm glad for that. Amen. Praise
[35:19] the Lord. You know, Bethl Tabernacle is
[35:21] a uh is a is an assembly of imports.
[35:25] Most of this assembly is imported, you
[35:27] know, and sometimes people come from
[35:30] families and from homes and they sojourn
[35:32] with us for a while and they head back
[35:34] to a home or a family or they move on to
[35:36] a completely new chapter. So, uh that
[35:39] that's the way it's always been here 30
[35:41] years. We're not expecting that to
[35:43] change anytime soon. But hey, you know,
[35:45] the Lord has always, you know, taken
[35:48] certain servants of the Lord and
[35:50] families onto another chapter and then
[35:52] he'll bring somebody else back in. So,
[35:54] all in all, we stay a wonderful,
[35:56] wonderful family and I appreciate that.
[35:58] What a wonderful family atmosphere that
[36:01] we have here. Amen. We have brother
[36:04] Benny. We want him to come make his way
[36:06] to the platform. It's been a long time.
[36:08] Too long. I was telling him, man, when I
[36:10] opened my door, I had to step back and
[36:11] take a picture of it. I said, "Brother
[36:13] Benny, it is so good to see you sitting
[36:15] there in that desk. It's been too many
[36:17] years since he's been." And uh but we're
[36:19] happy today. And I want you just to uh

[40:52] Lord richly bless you. I appreciate
[40:53] brother Jason giving us this opportunity
[40:56] and uh to be able to speak to you. And
[41:00] yes, I'm always nervous.
[41:03] Amen. But once he come, it'd be all
[41:05] right. Amen. Amen. If my background, I
[41:08] wasn't a speaker. But when he called me
[41:11] to preach, he made me a speaker. soon
[41:13] after I finish preaching, I don't have
[41:15] much to talk about.
[41:17] May God bless you. Good to have my wife
[41:19] with me and some of the saints uh from
[41:22] y'all of Bethl. We El Beth Tabernacle.
[41:26] Amen. So, we want to get right to the
[41:28] word. How many look How many look
[41:30] forward to the word?
[41:31] &gt;&gt; How many come to hear from Jesus?
[41:34] &gt;&gt; Thank God for a great message.
[41:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. Everything else falling apart.
[41:39] Glory. But this message, it keeps the
[41:42] bride and God's church in position and
[41:44] in place.
[41:45] &gt;&gt; So if you're looking at the NBC, ABC,
[41:48] whatever, all that there is is a that's
[41:50] fake news. The modern event has been
[41:54] made clear by prophecy.
[41:56] &gt;&gt; So we don't have to worry about their
[41:57] news. Glory. We have one of the greatest
[41:59] news flashes in history.
[42:02] &gt;&gt; And because he lived, we shall live
[42:04] also.
[42:05] &gt;&gt; Praise God. Let me turn to scripture and
[42:08] I'll let you be seated in a minute.
[42:10] Let's turn if you will to um
[42:14] the book of Job and then we'll be going
[42:16] to Timothy
[42:18] and then we're going to I've heard but
[42:20] now I see. Uh start Job 32
[42:27] and let's start at verse 8. It says,
[42:31] "But there is a spirit in man,
[42:34] and the inspiration of the Almighty give
[42:37] them understanding."
[42:40] &gt;&gt; And let's turn to
[42:42] Timothy, second Timothy,
[42:49] and verse 16, very familiar.
[42:52] All scripture is given by inspiration of
[42:55] God and is profitable for doctrine for
[43:00] reprove for correction for instruction
[43:03] and righteousness that the man of God
[43:05] may be perfectly thirsty and furnished
[43:07] unto all good works.
[43:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's uh go if you will to the
[43:15] message I heard but now I see as brother
[43:17] Brandham here talking about the story
[43:20] about Job and so forth. And let's start
[43:23] at paragraph 82.
[43:26] He says he had a channel of
[43:28] communication to God that he had got by
[43:32] inspiration.
[43:34] He had a way of moving himself out and
[43:38] letting God move in. And he know he was
[43:41] justified. It was a gift. It was a gift
[43:44] for the people and not for Job, but for
[43:47] the people. That's what all divine gifts
[43:50] are to serve God's people with
[43:52] everybody. Uh everybody in order to that
[43:56] prophet. All of you. Now just read that
[43:58] first portion. Heavenly Father, Lord, as
[44:02] we come this morning in the name of the
[44:05] Jesus Christ and is not by power nor by
[44:08] might, but by your spirit, said the
[44:11] Lord. Lord, we give you this service.
[44:14] Heal the sick, cast out devils, renew
[44:17] our strength, change our lives, give us
[44:20] our direction. Lord, we know that you
[44:22] are here cuz you promise what two or
[44:24] three are gathered together in your
[44:26] name. Dare you be in the midst, Father.
[44:29] take control of this service now. And
[44:31] brother Bram said, "What is a gift is
[44:33] getting yourself out the way." Lord,
[44:35] help me to move out the way that the
[44:38] Holy Spirit will have the preeminence
[44:40] and you can speak to your people and we
[44:41] can say, "Did not our hearts burn within
[44:43] us as you talk with us along the way and
[44:46] open to scripture in Jesus Christ's
[44:49] name." Amen. You may be seated. Glory.
[44:53] My my my topic this morning is uh in in
[44:57] a channel inspiration that moves get you
[45:02] moves you into
[45:04] that moves God in. Amen. Praise the
[45:08] Lord. Now, Brother Brandham was talking
[45:10] about here. He said, and I heard, but
[45:12] now I see Job was the oldest book in the
[45:15] Bible. And Job may you we find that Job
[45:21] didn't have a place he could go like we
[45:23] have today. We could go to the Bible. We
[45:26] could go to scriptures and when somebody
[45:28] say you know what brother Brandham said
[45:30] we could go check it out. Well Job had
[45:33] to go by inspiration. He didn't have no
[45:36] scripture he could go to and say well
[45:38] God said this or God said that. But he
[45:41] was inspired by everything that he done.
[45:44] Now in the me message masterpiece,
[45:46] brother Brandham says, "Glory, a
[45:48] musician is in is inspired."
[45:51] &gt;&gt; Glory, a artist is inspired. Glory uh
[45:54] and so forth. And when Michelangelo
[45:58] caught the inspiration of how Moses
[46:01] looked, he got inspired
[46:03] &gt;&gt; and he didn't know what Moses looked
[46:05] like, but something in him saw it that
[46:09] what Moses looked like and he started
[46:11] begin to carve and got a rock. Now to
[46:14] everybody else it just looked like a
[46:15] rock but to Michelangelo
[46:18] it was Moses' face that he was carving
[46:21] out the way it looked. And sometimes you
[46:23] know how many thank God for this great
[46:25] message.
[46:26] &gt;&gt; I don't care what anybody Let me just
[46:28] get to a point. I don't care what
[46:29] anybody say, what things going on, how
[46:31] many quit. You have thus sayeth the
[46:34] Lord. Glory. No matter how many people
[46:36] talk against it, Glory. This message
[46:38] Glory that God sent is the final voice.
[46:41] It's you and I. the final voice to the
[46:43] final age. We are at the end time and
[46:46] God has given us the authority to take
[46:49] this message. Glory. And let me tell you
[46:51] something, it will drive out every
[46:53] enemy. And I tell the church, people
[46:55] worry about what Trump doing, what this
[46:57] person doing, what's going on. Glory.
[46:59] But God has given you, glory, an
[47:01] abstract title D. Glory. You come from
[47:04] God and you're going back to God. And
[47:07] no, nothing can stop that. Glory. You
[47:09] people say, "Oh, I quit." Glory. If you
[47:11] a part of God from the foundation of the
[47:13] world, you can't quit. It's something on
[47:15] the inside of you. Brother Brandham call
[47:17] it a deep call into the deep. Glory. And
[47:20] if there's a deep call to the deep,
[47:21] there has to be a deep to respond. We're
[47:24] not here in this message trying to make
[47:25] it. Glory, sir. We have already made it.
[47:28] Glory. We're not trying to be a message,
[47:30] how can I overcome? Brother Brandham
[47:32] says you've already overcome. Glory.
[47:34] Why? Because he live, you shall live
[47:37] also. You know, people say, "Oh, I'm
[47:38] trying to make it." Glory. You got to
[47:40] try it. Jesus already made it for you.
[47:42] What you got to do is accept what God
[47:45] already done. Glory. Inspiration.
[47:48] Inspiration. Sometime you get inspired.
[47:51] How many know a song leader is inspired?
[47:53] A songwriter is inspired. Glory. You
[47:55] know sometimes we we look at things and
[47:59] we've been in this message a long time
[48:01] and you hear ups and down. Glory. Don't
[48:03] worry about who failed. Don't worry
[48:05] about who's not making it. What you need
[48:08] to do is worry about God has
[48:09] predestinated me and he chosen me from
[48:12] the foundation of the world and guess
[48:14] what? I'm going to take what God give
[48:17] me. Glory. And the devil ain't going to
[48:18] take nothing from me. Glory. Every
[48:20] believer has to be tested and tried.
[48:23] Hallelujah. God don't care how much
[48:25] money you got. God ain't looking at what
[48:27] color you is. God ain't looking at how
[48:29] what your status is. What God looking
[48:32] at? Will you believe my word? He that
[48:34] heareth my word and believeth on him
[48:37] that sent me has everlasting life and
[48:40] shall not come into condemnation but is
[48:42] passed from death unto life.
[48:44] inspiration.
[48:46] Sometimes you get inspired and God have
[48:49] you to do something, you know, like
[48:51] Michael Angelo the message master uh
[48:53] masterpiece brother Brandham says he one
[48:55] day just sitting there he was wanted to
[48:57] know and he caught that inspiration. How
[49:00] does this how does uh uh Moses look? And
[49:03] he started carving it. Carving it. But
[49:05] the thing what it is about what got me,
[49:08] brother Ram said, what made it a
[49:09] masterpiece? He said after he had carved
[49:11] it out and after he got it so beautiful,
[49:14] it looked perfect. It looked just like
[49:16] what he wanted, what he saw in his mind.
[49:18] And when he saw that masterpiece and he
[49:21] saw Michelangelo, he got so inspired.
[49:23] Listen, it just didn't wasn't a rock no
[49:26] more. It become so real to him. what was
[49:29] in his mind was standing before him. And
[49:31] he took that hammer and he said,
[49:32] "Speak." And he bust the leg on it. Oh
[49:35] my goodness. I can imagine. But his
[49:37] inspiration, his inspiration became a
[49:40] reality. And let me tell you something.
[49:42] Your inspiration must come a reality.
[49:45] Let God move you into the, you know, not
[49:47] be in the message. No, you are the
[49:50] message.
[49:51] &gt;&gt; Are you listening now? I read all
[49:53] scriptures given by inspiration. Glory.
[49:55] The Bible is written by people lives.
[49:58] How many know that? Glory. Their lives
[50:01] is the word. When you read about Esther,
[50:03] you're reading about a life that please
[50:05] God. When you read about Samuel, you
[50:08] reading about a life. The word. Are you
[50:10] listening? The Bible is God in letter
[50:13] form.
[50:14] &gt;&gt; Glory. One time he sent his prophet
[50:18] uh Samuel. He said, "Listen, I have
[50:20] provided me a king. I have a king in the
[50:24] house of Jesse. And Samuel, he gets his
[50:27] ore. He goes down there in the house of
[50:30] Jesse. And Jesse had eight sons. And as
[50:34] he anointed each child, you know,
[50:36] anointed this boy, didn't feel no, he
[50:38] didn't feel no inspiration. Anointed
[50:41] another one, anointed all seven of them.
[50:43] And then he got ready. And God kept
[50:46] saying, "Anoint it ain't on him. It's
[50:48] not on him.
[50:49] &gt;&gt; Not on him." And Samuel thought, "Maybe
[50:51] something is wrong." He says, "Jesse,
[50:54] have you got any more sons?" He said,
[50:56] "Yes, I got one son." But he's always
[51:00] singing to the sheep. He's an oddball.
[51:03] He's one in a million. He He always
[51:06] doing something strange. He's always
[51:08] reading the message. He always in the
[51:10] spoken word book. He's listen to the
[51:12] tape. Glory. I don't I says, "I got him,
[51:14] but we just keep him outside because
[51:16] he's like an outcast." And Samuel said,
[51:19] "But let me tell you something. Bring
[51:21] him here. I need to see him, Glory, cuz
[51:24] I can't take the sacrifice and eat
[51:26] until, Glory, I anoint a king." And God
[51:28] said, "A king is in this house." Let me
[51:30] tell you something, Glory. There's a
[51:32] bride in this house.
[51:34] &gt;&gt; And there ain't going to be a rapture
[51:35] until the bride get herself ready. And
[51:38] the bride must make herself ready.
[51:40] Glory. And when Jesse come, glory to
[51:42] God, he didn't come to church or when he
[51:45] come to Jesse house. You and David come
[51:47] and said, "David, come out here. Lead
[51:48] the sheep alone. I need you to come in
[51:50] here. We have a prophet with thus said
[51:52] the Lord." And I God has blessed my
[51:55] house. I got a king in here. Glory. And
[51:57] he didn't know that his king was David.
[52:00] The one that they rejected, the one that
[52:02] David didn't have nothing to do with.
[52:03] And I can imagine glory. David come
[52:06] there and he start coming in the house.
[52:09] And he walked in there and Samuel jumped
[52:10] up. He said, "Oh my God, that's him."
[52:14] But David, him and two omnipotent meat.
[52:16] In other words, David was singing, "My
[52:18] Lord is my light and my salvation. The
[52:20] Lord is my strength." And him and Samuel
[52:23] to the prophet and and David got the
[52:26] connection. And Samuel, I can imagine,
[52:28] jumped up. He said, "Jesse, you didn't
[52:30] know what you had in your house. That's
[52:32] God's king. That's God's anointed. And
[52:34] sometime people with friends in the
[52:36] church go around. Sometime you don't
[52:38] realize what you got in your house. You
[52:40] got sons and daughters of God that was
[52:42] predestinated from the foundation of the
[52:45] world that be part God put them place
[52:47] here. It's not just you going to a
[52:49] church with somebody. It's God placing
[52:51] sons and daughters of God in an area
[52:54] that he want. Glory to God that he want
[52:56] you to be do something special for God.
[52:59] &gt;&gt; Praise God. Glory. I can imagine when
[53:03] David got up this God's looking he was
[53:07] anointed. He was inspired. Glory. And
[53:10] you know, we look at brother, brother
[53:12] Brandham, you know, he said, "Oh, he's a
[53:14] prophet. He was a prophet." But do you
[53:15] know he got inspired
[53:17] &gt;&gt; one day sitting there, he's looking at
[53:19] pen and the Holy Ghost said, "Pick up
[53:20] your pen and write. Pick up your pen and
[53:23] write." Listen, brother Bradamon, right?
[53:25] No, he wrote the entire message. You
[53:27] didn't know that, did you? Glory. All
[53:29] 1100 message was his message. But here,
[53:31] the Holy Ghost inspired it. Pick up the
[53:33] pen and write. Here's the secret. The
[53:36] word is in the bride. Glory. And she
[53:40] would do a greater work. Glory. The word
[53:42] is in you. Glory. It's not beside you.
[53:45] It's not, you know, on the tapes. It's
[53:47] not just on the books. The word is the
[53:49] bride. Glory. They can close every
[53:52] church door. They can do what they want
[53:53] to do. Glory. But inside, he said, "If
[53:56] you abide in me, my words abide in you.
[53:59] Ask what you will
[54:00] &gt;&gt; and it shall be given to you." Glory.
[54:02] The word glory is inside of you.
[54:05] &gt;&gt; Do you believe that? You become the
[54:07] living word. You become the manifested
[54:10] word. Let church say amen. Glory God.
[54:12] Job didn't have no Bible to read. No
[54:14] sir. But one thing Job had, he had the
[54:17] inspiration that moved him into a
[54:19] channel of God. One time, you know, how
[54:22] about how many you remember Simeon?
[54:23] Brother Brandham talked about Simeon.
[54:25] &gt;&gt; He said, Simeon, Glory, God had revealed
[54:28] to him.
[54:29] &gt;&gt; You know something like in the message
[54:30] when God reveals something to you, I
[54:32] don't care. You ain't got to try to
[54:34] prove it to nobody. You ain't got to try
[54:36] to make them believe it. All you got to
[54:38] do is stand on it and wait on God and
[54:40] watch God vindicate it. And Simeon years
[54:44] he's in church and God told him said,
[54:47] "Look, Simeon, you're not going to die
[54:49] until you have received the Lord Christ
[54:52] until you." So, his job was to let
[54:55] church say, "Amen." His job was to do
[54:57] what? Every eight days he had to
[54:59] dedicate babies. Can you imagine every
[55:02] eight days how many years he was in
[55:04] church? How many times it was revealed
[55:06] to him? Let's say if he started with a
[55:08] young man, now he get old. Oh, and
[55:10] babies still coming in. He's still
[55:12] anointing babies. Still trying to get
[55:14] babies, you know, anoint him. So, and he
[55:17] got so old. Glory. One day they didn't
[55:20] see him in church. He might have said,
[55:22] "You know what? The old man must have
[55:24] done died. He ain't coming no more." And
[55:26] he been telling us that, you know, he
[55:29] was going to see the Lord's Christ. I
[55:30] guess he ain't come. And about two
[55:32] months later, maybe he was sick. All of
[55:34] a sudden, he back in church on duty
[55:37] dedicating babies. And they call, you
[55:39] know, the talk went around in church.
[55:40] Maybe maybe I thought he was dead, but
[55:42] he's still alive. He told me that he
[55:44] wasn't going to die until he have seen
[55:46] the Lord Christ. And the Messiah ain't
[55:48] here yet. We don't know where he is.
[55:50] Glory. But Simeon, he was certain of
[55:53] God. Glory. He dotted every eye, crossed
[55:56] every tea. He knew that what God told
[55:58] him, it had to come to pass. Gy are you
[56:01] listening now? You can be certain of God
[56:03] in this generation. I know I'm getting
[56:05] ahead of myself, but be certain of God.
[56:08] There's going to be a rapture for the
[56:09] bride. You can be certain of that. I
[56:12] don't care how many things changing.
[56:14] Glory. God will make his word come to
[56:16] pass.
[56:17] &gt;&gt; Let me tell you something.
[56:19] &gt;&gt; No man can make nothing come to pass.
[56:22] &gt;&gt; Glory. It takes God to fulfill his word.
[56:25] &gt;&gt; Glory. Hallelujah. Do you love the Lord?
[56:28] &gt;&gt; And Simeon, wait, wait. They said, "My,
[56:32] he's still here. He ain't dead yet."
[56:34] Glory. And all of a sudden, one day,
[56:36] Simeon just in church, a normal church
[56:38] service, and he come and oh, here come a
[56:41] young man and a young woman, Mary and
[56:43] Joseph, come to coming to church. And
[56:45] they come, they had this little baby,
[56:46] and Simeon got anointed. Glory. He felt
[56:49] good. Inspiration don't lead you wrong.
[56:52] Inspiration moves you right into the
[56:54] plan of God. God, it's a channel. Once
[56:56] you catch that channel, every person, I
[56:59] don't care, even a preacher when he's
[57:00] preaching, he's got to have the
[57:02] inspiration.
[57:03] &gt;&gt; Glory. Singer must have inspiration.
[57:06] Glory. Musicians must be inspired.
[57:08] Glory. And here was Glory. When he
[57:11] walked up to the Mary and Joseph, he
[57:13] didn't know who the baby was, what it
[57:15] looked like, when it was going to come.
[57:17] And it didn't make no difference. When
[57:19] God got ready to reveal it, he couldn't
[57:22] go wrong. Glory. And he walked over
[57:24] there to him and walked over there and
[57:25] picked up uh Jesus out of the arms of
[57:28] Mary and Joseph. He said, "Lord, let
[57:30] your servant depart in peace for my eyes
[57:33] have seen your salvation."
[57:35] &gt;&gt; What was he could have said, "This day,
[57:38] this scripture, what you promised me has
[57:40] been fulfilled." Glory. You are part of
[57:43] something. Glory. Do you realize you are
[57:46] closing out the gentile age?
[57:48] &gt;&gt; After you this this after this age, it
[57:50] ain't going to be no more. Glory. God
[57:52] have us closing this gentile age out.
[57:54] Glory. And you know I I'm going just say
[57:56] it like this here. Look at here. I'm
[57:59] using as a type. Look at all the great
[58:01] men that gone before us. I'm just use
[58:02] brother Perry Green, brother brother
[58:05] Bisco, the different brothers that's
[58:07] gone on that that come. You know when
[58:09] they first come in to the message
[58:11] following brother Brandham, you can
[58:13] count how many men was on his hand.
[58:15] Glory. How many was there? They used to
[58:17] have ministers meeting. Glory. 12 15
[58:19] brothers back there. Glory. And I just t
[58:22] like I said that's just like Jesus with
[58:24] Peter, Paul and they was around brother
[58:25] Brown because it was a fresh message. It
[58:28] was a new message. It was a new day.
[58:31] Jesus Christ was the same but the new
[58:33] message had to bring in new people to to
[58:36] spread the message. And now here here we
[58:39] are. Look at these young men in the
[58:41] message now. They grab this message and
[58:43] brother Brandon prophesied they will
[58:45] sweep it throughout the world. What's
[58:46] going on Glory? They grabbing it. You in
[58:49] do you realize sers what time is it?
[58:52] Glory. Do you recognize your time?
[58:54] Recognize your day. Just don't say oh
[58:56] I'm in a church here in Beth. No. You
[58:58] are part of God's eternal plan. The
[59:01] great attributes of God now being on
[59:03] display. The word is where at? It's in
[59:06] the bride. It's in you. It's in me. The
[59:09] world won't see. And brother Brandham
[59:10] quoted that line. world won't see me no
[59:13] more but you shall see me for I personal
[59:17] pronoun will be with you even in you
[59:19] under the baptism of the Holy Ghost the
[59:21] Christ in you the hope of glory grieve
[59:24] not the Holy Spirit whereby you're
[59:25] sealed until the day of your redemption
[59:27] you know sometimes you're doing
[59:29] something for God in the Bible you may
[59:31] God tell you to do something and like he
[59:33] did Joshua he said Joshua go kill go
[59:37] destroy AI glory matter of fact we need
[59:39] to destroy AI today got So many people
[59:42] trust in AI more than they trust in God.
[59:44] Glory. All that church say amen. People
[59:46] don't like that. Say that. But education
[59:48] is of the devil. Glory. Politics is of
[59:50] the devil. Glory. And the god of this
[59:53] evil age. Go. Are you listening? Glory.
[59:55] He says Satan is the god of this evil
[59:57] age. Church. Say amen. It's good to be
[59:59] smart. It's good to have a great
[1:00:01] education. It's good to have a good job.
[1:00:03] But it's more better to have faith than
[1:00:04] what God said. Glory. Cuz faith take
[1:00:07] those things as not and make them as
[1:00:09] though they were. Oh, let church say
[1:00:11] amen.
[1:00:12] &gt;&gt; Don't get quiet on me. Glory. Glory. Let
[1:00:14] make me think. Glory. You got to believe
[1:00:16] this message. Glory. If you say
[1:00:17] education of the devil, then it's got to
[1:00:19] be of the devil. Glory. Hallelujah.
[1:00:21] Glory.
[1:00:23] At the end time. Glory. We at the end
[1:00:26] time.
[1:00:27] &gt;&gt; We are at the end time.
[1:00:29] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[1:00:30] &gt;&gt; This is our day. This is our message.
[1:00:33] You know, look at Brother Brandham
[1:00:34] talked about with Russia back then
[1:00:37] there. How many remember the Soviet
[1:00:38] Union? Yeah,
[1:00:39] &gt;&gt; it ain't had nothing to do with Russia.
[1:00:41] They ain't had nothing. You ain't no
[1:00:42] Russia existence.
[1:00:44] &gt;&gt; But here's a prophet says, "Glory, watch
[1:00:46] Russia before everybody else was
[1:00:48] watching you and the Soviet Union. They
[1:00:50] was watching all these other countries,
[1:00:52] the United States." Glory. But look at
[1:00:53] Russia and that message recognized your
[1:00:55] day. He said Russia recognized that day.
[1:00:58] You say, "Well, wait a minute. They get
[1:00:59] coming up because God already ordained
[1:01:02] them to be what they are going to be.
[1:01:04] And they will take, are you listening?
[1:01:07] They got a bomb ready for this country.
[1:01:09] Glory.
[1:01:10] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:01:11] &gt;&gt; And I was in Phoenix, Arizona, out there
[1:01:14] visiting and and uh I went by brother
[1:01:17] Brun and different places. But the first
[1:01:19] time I says, I got to ride in prophecy.
[1:01:23] So they say everybody, you know, cars,
[1:01:24] you know, you know that halfway drive,
[1:01:27] you know, you set it, you have to still
[1:01:30] steer it. I said, no, brother Brandham
[1:01:32] said there would be a car with no no
[1:01:34] steering wheel driving down the road.
[1:01:36] All you do is sit in it.
[1:01:38] &gt;&gt; So I had my deacon with me. Glory. I
[1:01:40] said, "Listen, they said we want to get
[1:01:42] I forgot what they call a car, but I
[1:01:44] took a picture of it and got out." He
[1:01:45] said, I said, "Go, I want to ride in
[1:01:47] that car. I want to ride and prophesy."
[1:01:50] Praise God. So the brother called he
[1:01:54] called the car the car we was at to came
[1:01:56] to the hotel, picked us up, nobody in
[1:02:00] it. drove by, got to the car, it called
[1:02:04] the deacon's name, tell him Elliot
[1:02:06] Richardson, your ride is here. I said,
[1:02:09] "You talking about powerful?" I said,
[1:02:11] "Look, glory." And listen, this was back
[1:02:13] in 1930 something, Brother Brandon
[1:02:15] talking. And here we were here day and
[1:02:17] we got in the car, opened the door, and
[1:02:19] got in. Are you listening? The car was
[1:02:23] so computerized. It was It was showing
[1:02:26] the streets. It was showing the people
[1:02:27] that was walking. It was stopping. And I
[1:02:29] said, "Man, I don't know about this
[1:02:31] here." And it kept on getting out in the
[1:02:33] way. And I was wondering what the car
[1:02:34] doing. It was flashing for the car. He
[1:02:36] was changing lanes. It was flashing for
[1:02:38] the other car over there to stop where
[1:02:40] he can get in. I said, "Man, this is got
[1:02:42] a lot of s." I said, told my dear, I
[1:02:44] said, "You know what? I thank God,
[1:02:46] Glory. I ain't talking about riding down
[1:02:48] watching TV. You can sit in there and
[1:02:50] don't worry about where you're going and
[1:02:52] when you get there, the carte you have
[1:02:54] arrived."
[1:02:55] Oh, glory. And if they could do that in
[1:02:57] the natural, what about the Holy Ghost
[1:03:00] get you to a place you have arrived.
[1:03:03] You're here. You're ready for the
[1:03:04] rapture. Glory to God. Recognize time is
[1:03:09] close. The hour is here. Glory. And
[1:03:12] Joshua God said, "Listen, you got to
[1:03:14] destroy destroy Ai. You got to you got
[1:03:17] to make sure." Man, God didn't say,
[1:03:18] "Wait till next week, you know, wait six
[1:03:21] months later." He said, "Destroy." And
[1:03:24] Joshua got in. He got the army. They
[1:03:26] started fighting. They started fighting.
[1:03:28] And he'd already heard from God. Glory.
[1:03:31] And And when the sun was going down, it
[1:03:33] was getting dark. He said, "Oh, if the
[1:03:34] enemy didn't say, Lord, if the enemy,
[1:03:36] can I wait till tomorrow cuz it's
[1:03:38] getting dark." You know, I said, "No,
[1:03:40] no, he didn't say." He was wondering,
[1:03:41] "Lord told me to finish." He didn't go
[1:03:43] try to get a second opinion. He didn't
[1:03:45] try to get a third. Ask God the second
[1:03:47] time. God said, "Destroy it today, not
[1:03:50] tomorrow. Don't wait next week. Do it
[1:03:51] today."
[1:03:53] &gt;&gt; So the sun was going down. It was
[1:03:55] getting dark and the enemy would hide
[1:03:56] and Joshua didn't know what to do. He
[1:03:58] didn't only thing he said inspiration
[1:04:00] struck him. He says, "Son, stand still."
[1:04:03] Now, I want to say this here. Let me say
[1:04:04] it. I don't know if Joshua know the son
[1:04:07] was going to stop. But he spoke it
[1:04:08] anyway. Go ahead. Why? Because he was
[1:04:10] inspired. And when you're inspired and
[1:04:12] God tell you to do something, God going
[1:04:14] to back it up. Yes, sir. Because he is
[1:04:17] the word. And the sun stood still. And
[1:04:20] Joshua and the moon stayed. Joshua
[1:04:22] fought until he destroyed the enemy that
[1:04:24] day. Oh, church of the living God bride.
[1:04:27] Do you know who we are? Third pool. I
[1:04:29] said, "Brother, when we get in the third
[1:04:30] pool and glory, you in the third pool."
[1:04:34] &gt;&gt; Glory. The first time the third pool was
[1:04:36] used on a mortal being was on sister bey
[1:04:40] first time it was used on a mortal
[1:04:42] being. Now, if he used it then, Glory,
[1:04:44] what about now? Glory. You way down the
[1:04:46] road. Glory. Speak. Glory. Speak the
[1:04:49] word. Speak the word. Keep talking. And
[1:04:51] sometimes we say things and we don't
[1:04:54] have enough patience to wait to it to
[1:04:55] come to pass.
[1:04:57] &gt;&gt; Glory. I always tell my church, listen,
[1:04:59] when you speak and ask God something,
[1:05:00] Glory. You got faith. Abraham was
[1:05:02] faithful to God. How many know that?
[1:05:03] Glory. He waited 25 years before you
[1:05:06] start complaining. Wait 25 years. Glory.
[1:05:09] Glory. I'm just I'm just saying that.
[1:05:12] Glory. Let church say amen. Glory. But
[1:05:14] inspiration. You got to be inspired.
[1:05:17] &gt;&gt; Glory. You know people come to church,
[1:05:19] you know. Oh, I just got to come with
[1:05:21] the message. I'm going come to church
[1:05:23] today. Glory. You should come in to
[1:05:24] church and Lord, glory, I'm anointed.
[1:05:27] You should be like Caleb. Lord, I'm
[1:05:29] coming to church. Give me my mountain.
[1:05:32] &gt;&gt; Glory. You know, sometimes we had, it's
[1:05:35] been a lot of battles in this message.
[1:05:36] You had all kind of things going on, all
[1:05:39] kind of doctors, all kind of this and
[1:05:40] that. But let me tell you, you still
[1:05:42] here.
[1:05:43] You still going on. What is keeping you?
[1:05:47] &gt;&gt; Yourself?
[1:05:49] &gt;&gt; No sir. It's Jesus Christ.
[1:05:51] &gt;&gt; He is the same yesterday, the dead,
[1:05:53] forever. Glory. Are you listening?
[1:05:56] &gt;&gt; One time the disciples, they they John
[1:06:00] had uh introduced Jesus. How many know
[1:06:02] that
[1:06:03] &gt;&gt; he had introduced Jesus Christ and he
[1:06:06] got in trouble. He got in a trial. And
[1:06:08] his trial was glory. They put him in
[1:06:11] jail. Herod, he was preaching against
[1:06:12] women preachers. Glory. And his trial
[1:06:15] was, let church say amen. I didn't say
[1:06:17] make no mistake when I said that. Glory.
[1:06:19] Every time Elijah come, brother Brandham
[1:06:21] say he he preaching get the women in
[1:06:23] line. I'm just bringing you quotes. Let
[1:06:26] church say amen. And John had been
[1:06:28] preaching and and Herod got mad because
[1:06:30] he said, "You can't have your brother
[1:06:32] pillow's wife." And Herod got mad and
[1:06:34] put him in jail.
[1:06:35] &gt;&gt; And we put John in jail. He's down in
[1:06:37] jail. You know how it is. You get a
[1:06:38] little down and discouraged. And John,
[1:06:40] listen, after he had introduced the
[1:06:43] Messiah, behold the lamb of God which
[1:06:46] take away the sins of the whole world.
[1:06:48] He had introduced him. Glory. And yet
[1:06:51] when he got so down, he called his
[1:06:53] disciples. He said, "Listen, I want you
[1:06:55] to go and ask, is he the one or do we
[1:06:59] look for another?"
[1:07:01] &gt;&gt; Oh, let church. Amen. You got a lot of
[1:07:03] people in the message. Is brother
[1:07:04] Brandham the one or is there another
[1:07:06] message coming? Ain't no more coming.
[1:07:08] Glory. You have God's final voice.
[1:07:11] &gt;&gt; You have it. Glory. And John actually
[1:07:13] asked Jesus, "Is you the go ask him? Is
[1:07:16] he the one or do he look for another?
[1:07:18] Glory. And so the disciples, they kind
[1:07:20] made their way to Jesus. They found him.
[1:07:22] And Jesus was in a meeting. Glory. Jesus
[1:07:24] was in a meeting. Y'all excuse me. I'm
[1:07:27] John the Baptist preacher. I can't be
[1:07:28] neat. Glory.
[1:07:30] And Jesus in in a meeting. And he
[1:07:33] preached and they said, "Excuse me.
[1:07:34] Excuse me, master. We John sent us to
[1:07:37] ask, is you the one or do we look for
[1:07:40] another?" You know what Jesus didn't
[1:07:42] answer? You know what Jesus told him?
[1:07:44] Look, stay here. Hear the gospel preach.
[1:07:47] Watch. See what the things that you see
[1:07:49] in here. In other words, he wanted them
[1:07:52] to see the fulfillment of the word.
[1:07:54] Glory. Not that working on their
[1:07:56] feelings. Watch what the word say that
[1:07:58] he would do. Then you'll know it's him
[1:08:01] or not. He heal the sick, cast out
[1:08:03] devils, the blinded eyes open, the deaf
[1:08:05] ears unstopped. He said, "Now go tell
[1:08:08] John what you hear and see." Glory. Are
[1:08:11] you listening now? Glory. Go tell John
[1:08:14] what you hear and see. So the disciples
[1:08:16] went back. They said, "John, John said,
[1:08:19] is what did he say? Is he say he the
[1:08:21] Messiah? Is he the one?" They said, "Oh,
[1:08:23] John, I'm telling you, you should have
[1:08:25] been in one of those church service."
[1:08:27] Oh, glory. The blinded eyes was open.
[1:08:30] The deaf ears was unstopped. And poor
[1:08:32] people were sitting down there in drove
[1:08:34] and he had the gospel preached unto
[1:08:36] them. And John got anointed. John jumped
[1:08:38] up and said, "Oh, glory." They said,
[1:08:40] "What's going on, John?" That's him.
[1:08:42] Glory. He's vindicated by the word.
[1:08:45] That's him. Glory. And your message,
[1:08:47] Glory. If you going to be excited, it's
[1:08:49] vindicated by the word.
[1:08:51] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:08:53] &gt;&gt; And they said, "John, what's happening?
[1:08:55] What's going on?" He said, "Tell Harry
[1:08:57] to come cut my head off. I'm ready."
[1:08:59] What it was? He knew, glory, that he was
[1:09:02] in the right place. He knew he had the
[1:09:04] right message. He wasn't guessing, "Oh,
[1:09:06] is brother Brandham right? Oh, this say
[1:09:08] this." He knew that it was right, Glory,
[1:09:10] because he saw the fulfillment of the
[1:09:13] word that was promised for that age.
[1:09:15] &gt;&gt; Behold, I will send you personally. You,
[1:09:19] Elijah, the prophet, glory. Not you and
[1:09:21] your sister. Not you and your mama. Not
[1:09:24] you and your best friend. I will send
[1:09:26] you.
[1:09:27] &gt;&gt; It's a personal pronoun. And once you
[1:09:29] catch it, Glory, you'll recognize who he
[1:09:32] is and why he was sent to you. Or let
[1:09:34] church. Amen.
[1:09:35] &gt;&gt; You can't go. God, you know, God reveals
[1:09:38] by revelation. You can't go to somebody
[1:09:40] say, "Well, what you think that you
[1:09:42] think, brother Brandham, right? What you
[1:09:44] think?" They might not never know
[1:09:46] anything. God might not even talk to
[1:09:48] them.
[1:09:49] &gt;&gt; Lord, do you know sometime God let
[1:09:51] church say amen in the Bible when a Ahab
[1:09:54] or who it was, he came there, he says,
[1:09:56] you know, and God told me, he said,
[1:09:57] "Listen, the prophet said, if
[1:09:59] Jehoshaphat wasn't with you, I wouldn't
[1:10:02] even give you a time of day." That's
[1:10:03] right.
[1:10:04] &gt;&gt; I wouldn't even waste my time with you.
[1:10:05] Come on, let church. Amen. You better
[1:10:07] thank God for this message. Malachi 4,
[1:10:11] Luke 17:30, Hebrews 13:8 is not just
[1:10:14] scripture. It's divine revelation for
[1:10:18] the church to overcome.
[1:10:20] &gt;&gt; Glory. Let me take a few more. Glory.
[1:10:23] Listen. Brother Brandon was inspired.

[1:10:50] looked at it he got anointed he was
[1:10:52] inspired and he said if a man was
[1:10:55] thinking he wouldn't even smoke these
[1:10:56] things. Glory. And if you were thinking,
[1:10:59] you wouldn't even be joining any kind of
[1:11:01] organization or denomination. You'll be
[1:11:03] born again of the Holy Ghost.
[1:11:05] &gt;&gt; Glory. A thinking man. Glory.
[1:11:10] Some people scared of the Holy Ghost.
[1:11:13] Listen, I was baptized a
[1:11:17] a a gentleman. and I was witnessing to
[1:11:18] him and uh I tried to get him to come
[1:11:21] this morning but he's only been baptized
[1:11:23] about two months and uh he he couldn't
[1:11:25] make it. He was working. He's a
[1:11:27] millionaire and he come down we was
[1:11:30] building our bill. I said listen I don't
[1:11:32] care about your money. I don't care
[1:11:34] about your skills. But I said God had
[1:11:37] you here to speak to me. I'm speaking to
[1:11:39] you for a reason. And he was telling me
[1:11:41] about how much he loved Jesus. So I said
[1:11:43] let me I got to tell him now. That was
[1:11:45] my That was my flashing red light.
[1:11:49] I said, "Now he's talking about Jesus.
[1:11:50] He talking about somebody and
[1:11:52] Pentecostal Bapt." I said, "Let me tell
[1:11:54] you something." I says, "If you receive
[1:11:58] Jesus Christ, have you received the Holy
[1:11:59] Ghost?" He said, "I don't know if I have
[1:12:01] it or not." I said, "You don't have it.
[1:12:03] &gt;&gt; Cuz when you get it, you know you got
[1:12:05] it."
[1:12:06] &gt;&gt; And I asked him, I said, "Didn't you
[1:12:07] know they told you when you was born?" I
[1:12:09] said, "You." He said, "Yeah." I said,
[1:12:10] "When you get the Holy Ghost, Glory." He
[1:12:12] was baptized in the name of father, son,
[1:12:14] holy ghost. And I started telling about
[1:12:16] the message and about squirrels were
[1:12:18] being created under he said Jesus
[1:12:19] Christ. I said listen he's the same
[1:12:20] yesterday had a prophet said this. He's
[1:12:23] the same yesterday then ever. And he
[1:12:24] says wonder why I ain't got the holy
[1:12:26] ghost. I said listen listen read Acts
[1:12:29] 238. This what cuz I was only dealing
[1:12:31] with I said you shall receive the gift
[1:12:33] of the Holy Ghost. I said you've been
[1:12:34] baptized you don't have the Holy Ghost
[1:12:36] you ain't going to make it. Go. He said,
[1:12:37] "I need to be baptized cuz this
[1:12:39] scripture says I shall receive the gift
[1:12:41] of the Holy Ghost."
[1:12:43] &gt;&gt; Praise God. We baptized him. That's
[1:12:45] about two months ago, right, baby? And
[1:12:46] baptized the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:12:48] Christ. This man is a millionaire.

[1:12:56] time. He want to hear that word every
[1:12:58] time I hear a message. Glory." He
[1:12:59] stirred about it. Glory. I give him end
[1:13:02] time seed sign. Glory. I gave him
[1:13:05] different ones. Glory. and recognizing
[1:13:06] your day in this message. He said,
[1:13:08] "Brother Perry, I'm beginning to
[1:13:10] recognize something different. I'm
[1:13:11] leaving this church." I said, "Listen,
[1:13:13] don't leave until God tell you to." I
[1:13:17] said, "When you hear the Holy Spirit
[1:13:19] speak to you, you when you go, you ain't
[1:13:21] never coming back." Glory. Hallelujah.
[1:13:24] He said, "Okay." He said, "But I'm about
[1:13:25] ready." I said, "When you get ready,
[1:13:27] when God get ready, you walk away.
[1:13:28] You'll never all you won't worry about
[1:13:30] your friends, your nephews, your cousin,
[1:13:33] your uncle, whatever. You'll walk right
[1:13:35] into the message of the hour. Glory.
[1:13:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. What the church need today,
[1:13:39] Glory. You know, it's good that we have
[1:13:41] all the quotes. Nothing wrong with that.
[1:13:42] But we need to do like s like uh Samson
[1:13:45] did. Lord, give me one more time. Lord,
[1:13:48] when I first come in the message, I was
[1:13:50] so fired up. I I made it to church. I
[1:13:53] made it to every prayer meeting. Lord,
[1:13:55] just once more. Some of us don't realize
[1:13:57] we have lost some of our gusto. Glory.
[1:13:59] What you need to do, Lord, once more,
[1:14:01] Lord. Let me feel the way I felt when I
[1:14:04] first come in the message. I want to
[1:14:06] feel when I was first illuminated. Go
[1:14:08] ahead. Trials and different things come.
[1:14:11] It weakens you spiritually. It gets you
[1:14:13] going over the years and all that
[1:14:16] church. Amen. Some of us get real hard,
[1:14:19] cold, formal like Glory. Listen, God
[1:14:22] don't owe you nothing.
[1:14:24] &gt;&gt; God don't owe none of us nothing.
[1:14:26] &gt;&gt; Glory. We come to church because we need
[1:14:28] him. Let me remind you, God don't need
[1:14:32] you.
[1:14:32] &gt;&gt; You need God. I need God. Glory. You
[1:14:36] can't change God. God come to change us.
[1:14:38] And when we walk in here, Glory, in the
[1:14:40] church, Glory, it's a privilege for us
[1:14:42] to be able to come in the presence of
[1:14:43] God. Many wise men and scholars and
[1:14:46] people educated want to sit where you
[1:14:48] sitting and they can't sit there. Why?
[1:14:50] Because it's revelation. It has to be
[1:14:52] revealed to them. And God revealed it to
[1:14:55] you. Babe, such as we learn. You think
[1:14:58] they don't want to come. People want to
[1:15:00] come. But no man can come except God
[1:15:03] called them.
[1:15:04] &gt;&gt; And all that the father has given me
[1:15:06] will come to me. I lose none
[1:15:08] &gt;&gt; except for the son of predition. You're
[1:15:10] in the greatest age. You're in the
[1:15:12] greatest time. You're in the greatest
[1:15:13] age of time you can ever live. You
[1:15:15] sitting in one of the greatest places
[1:15:16] you can sit in the end time message.
[1:15:19] Well, God is calling the elected bride.
[1:15:21] Glory. He ain't calling the church.
[1:15:23] Glory. He got plenty churches. Glory.
[1:15:25] But he's calling. He want a wife. He
[1:15:27] wants somebody that can marry to him
[1:15:30] that will be a part of him. B like Adam
[1:15:32] was bones of his bones, flesh of his
[1:15:34] flesh, word of his word, life of his
[1:15:36] life. Glory. He wants somebody that's
[1:15:38] married to him.
[1:15:41] &gt;&gt; That's what this message come from.
[1:15:43] &gt;&gt; Glory. Listen.
[1:15:46] An expectation. Brother Brandham says,
[1:15:48] listen, you ought to come to church
[1:15:49] expecting God.
[1:15:51] &gt;&gt; Let church. Amen.
[1:15:54] Not coming on some days expecting. He
[1:15:57] said you come expecting God to do
[1:15:59] something every service. And when you do
[1:16:00] that there, Glory, listen. The preacher
[1:16:01] can't preach. The musicians have a hard
[1:16:04] time. Glory. Why? Because you in
[1:16:06] expectation. Expectation for what?
[1:16:08] Glory. I come in to see sister so and
[1:16:10] so. Brother Brandham already told if you
[1:16:12] want to see sister so and so, brother so
[1:16:13] and so, you go to their house. But when
[1:16:15] you come to church, you come to see God.
[1:16:18] &gt;&gt; Sir, we would see Jesus. The Greeks came
[1:16:22] to the Passover. They wanted to see
[1:16:23] Jesus. They didn't come. I want to see
[1:16:25] Peter, John, and James. You know, I know
[1:16:27] they disciples of the Lord, and I know
[1:16:29] they good. They read the message and
[1:16:31] they good. Glory. When they got there,
[1:16:33] they said, "Sir, we would see Jesus."
[1:16:35] Philip telling Andrew and Andrew telling
[1:16:37] Phillip, "Glory." And they went to get
[1:16:39] Jesus. And you know what? Those Greeks,
[1:16:41] you know how far they travel? Greece is
[1:16:42] a long ways. Glory. Long ways by plane.
[1:16:45] But they come from Athens, Greece to
[1:16:48] hear Jesus. And when he walked out
[1:16:49] there, go ahead. He looked at the stern
[1:16:52] we see Jesus. Jesus come out there. And
[1:16:54] they looked at him and Jesus said, "I
[1:16:56] set up the corner of wheat fall in the
[1:16:57] ground and die. It abide alone." In
[1:16:59] other words, you know what he's telling?
[1:17:00] You looking for me, but you can't see
[1:17:03] me. Glory. You only see the shell that
[1:17:05] is, but the mighty God has been veiled.
[1:17:08] Glory. They came to see God. Glory. And
[1:17:10] they saw the manifestation of a man.
[1:17:12] Glory. God was hiding behind Jesus
[1:17:15] Christ.
[1:17:16] &gt;&gt; Let me tell you something today. God is
[1:17:18] hiding behind the bride. Go. You may
[1:17:20] think it's just a little sister or just
[1:17:22] a little brother there. Glory. Well,
[1:17:24] things has changed now. Glory.
[1:17:26] &gt;&gt; You. She has become him.
[1:17:29] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[1:17:31] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[1:17:32] &gt;&gt; Inspiration.
[1:17:34] &gt;&gt; This is sister had it right. We hear
[1:17:35] that story all the time. You know, if it
[1:17:38] was a Bible, she'd have been in the
[1:17:39] Bible. But she's in the spoken word.
[1:17:42] &gt;&gt; The spoken word is God. Let church say
[1:17:44] Amen. Brother says part of the Bible. It
[1:17:46] is the Bible. Ain't the B. It don't make
[1:17:48] no difference what they say. She's in
[1:17:50] the word. Glory. Glory. And when you go
[1:17:53] read about sister had it, right, Glory?
[1:17:56] You know, she got inspired. She come out
[1:17:58] there. Brother B was just talking about
[1:18:00] the silver tip grizzly and the hunting
[1:18:01] trip. You know, some of us said we're
[1:18:03] hunting. Oh, went on a trip and we had a
[1:18:05] good time. You hunting and you know, we
[1:18:07] take it like, you know, maybe it's okay,
[1:18:09] but it's not nothing really important.
[1:18:11] And sister had it right when he come.
[1:18:14] She start he start talking about the
[1:18:16] silver tip grizz and everything that
[1:18:17] happened on the trip and she said
[1:18:20] brother Brandham that's nothing but the
[1:18:22] truth
[1:18:23] &gt;&gt; that inside of her heart was so sincere
[1:18:26] God come down say give her what you want
[1:18:29] &gt;&gt; glory you know what she was so inspired
[1:18:33] she didn't even know what she wanted or
[1:18:34] what she needed she was so satisfied

[1:18:39] satisfied with God be content with the
[1:18:42] word get quiet Sometime run for pillar

[1:18:46] know where he going. Go. You got to be
[1:18:48] certain that what God told you going is
[1:18:50] the truth. Go ahead.
[1:18:52] &gt;&gt; And sister had it right. Said, "Brother
[1:18:53] Brandom, I don't know what to ask. I I
[1:18:56] don't know what." He said, "Well,
[1:18:57] sister, I can't ask for you." Boy,
[1:18:59] that'd be somebody in the message said,
[1:19:00] "Yeah, I tell you what God want done
[1:19:02] with your life. Let me tell you what God
[1:19:04] want with you." Glory. Glory.
[1:19:07] &gt;&gt; She said, "Sister, sister Rice, brother
[1:19:10] Brandham, I don't know what to ask." He
[1:19:11] said, "Well, I can't tell you. I don't
[1:19:12] know what it it but only thing I tell
[1:19:14] what is your desire can you believe it

[1:19:42] She said, "Brother Brandon, my greatest
[1:19:44] desire is the salvation of my two boys.
[1:19:47] &gt;&gt; In the name of Jesus Christ, I give you
[1:19:50] your two boys. Glory." And they fell on
[1:19:52] their knees, start crying out to God
[1:19:53] right then and there. Somebody say,
[1:19:55] "Well, they ain't went to church." I
[1:19:56] don't care if they don't go to church.
[1:19:57] They ain't never had to go to church. A
[1:19:59] gift is a gift.
[1:20:02] &gt;&gt; Oh, let church say amen. Don't get
[1:20:04] quiet. I've heard people in the message
[1:20:06] earlier, yeah, they never did go to
[1:20:07] church. I don't care if they didn't go.
[1:20:09] God said, "I give them to you."
[1:20:11] &gt;&gt; Glory. When God give you something, you
[1:20:13] know, you think God's the Indian giver,
[1:20:14] he ain't know. He said, I give you a
[1:20:16] salvation of your two boys. When she get
[1:20:18] on the other side, if they don't step a
[1:20:20] foot in the church, she'll see him on
[1:20:22] the other side. Why? Because God said
[1:20:24] so.
[1:20:25] &gt;&gt; You can't make God have a liar. Oh no.
[1:20:28] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[1:20:30] &gt;&gt; All of a sudden, glory stick inspires
[1:20:34] inspiration
[1:20:36] people. the word you. How many heard
[1:20:39] brother Brandham said when you find
[1:20:41] somebody God did something for somebody
[1:20:42] in the word and he and you meet the same
[1:20:45] qualification or same thing he said God
[1:20:47] is obligated
[1:20:49] &gt;&gt; to do the same thing for you or else he
[1:20:52] acted wrong in the first place
[1:20:54] &gt;&gt; and God don't act wrong
[1:20:56] &gt;&gt; no sir Lord he's obligated glory to keep
[1:20:59] his word listen when the inspiration
[1:21:03] sometime it comes you don't even know
[1:21:06] Job in the time of crisis is you know
[1:21:09] sometime when people get in trials and
[1:21:10] get in hard instead of them crying out
[1:21:12] to God glory they they first on they get
[1:21:16] on nothing wrong with that if people do
[1:21:18] that they call sister so s you don't
[1:21:20] know how I'm going through real bad
[1:21:22] times you don't notice my uncle died my
[1:21:24] family died my nobody loves me and so
[1:21:26] forth and they get in a time of crisis
[1:21:29] the one that they should be crying on
[1:21:32] &gt;&gt; is God
[1:21:33] &gt;&gt; glory listen that's why God took away
[1:21:36] how many know God took away the high
[1:21:37] priest priest. The high priest, you come
[1:21:39] in there and said, "Listen, I got
[1:21:40] cancelled." He said, "Well, I can have
[1:21:42] cancer, too." Glory. But this high
[1:21:44] priest,
[1:21:45] &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ is a high priest forever
[1:21:47] after the order of mazdc. Glory. He
[1:21:50] knows what we going through. He feels
[1:21:52] what we going through. And guess what?
[1:21:54] He can do something about it.
[1:21:56] &gt;&gt; But a natural priest never could.
[1:21:59] &gt;&gt; He can only sympathize with you.
[1:22:01] &gt;&gt; But Jesus can step in there.
[1:22:03] &gt;&gt; Glory. And he can take take the place.
[1:22:06] He can feel your infirmities. He can
[1:22:08] feel what's going on. Glory church. Say
[1:22:10] amen.
[1:22:11] &gt;&gt; I think brother Bam talked about the
[1:22:13] Sonician woman. He in several places of
[1:22:15] perseverance. He preached that message
[1:22:17] several times maybe over 15. He said,
[1:22:19] "Listen, you got to be persistent. You
[1:22:22] got to be persevering." Sometime people
[1:22:23] want God to do something for them and
[1:22:26] they ain't persisting. God want you to
[1:22:28] be constant. Persistent. Persistent. And
[1:22:30] that woman and sometime things going to
[1:22:32] happen. It gonna happen. Look like God
[1:22:35] let it happen.
[1:22:36] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:22:36] &gt;&gt; And really, he did.
[1:22:39] &gt;&gt; Glory. The devil can't do nothing to you
[1:22:40] unless God allow it.
[1:22:43] &gt;&gt; Don't give the devil no credit. You
[1:22:45] better give a credit to God. He have to
[1:22:47] go to God. Like I'm coming into my text
[1:22:49] now. He have to go to God and ask God,
[1:22:52] let you know why they doing good in
[1:22:53] their business. They doing good in their
[1:22:55] life. You know why they doing? Cuz you
[1:22:57] are protecting them. Let me have them.
[1:22:59] And I guarantee you they'll lead a
[1:23:01] message.
[1:23:04] I'm just saying that because that's our
[1:23:05] age. You understand? I'm saying that
[1:23:07] because of age. They said they'll curse
[1:23:09] you to your face and go glory glory. But
[1:23:11] that's what happen. Things going to
[1:23:12] happen. People, you know, oh, I'm gone.
[1:23:15] It It ain't what I thought it was. It
[1:23:16] ain't what it glory. Of course, it ain't
[1:23:18] what you thought it was. You got to
[1:23:20] think what God thought it was.
[1:23:22] &gt;&gt; Glory. Your idea and God's idea is two
[1:23:24] different things. And let let me just
[1:23:26] say, my thoughts are not your thoughts.
[1:23:28] My ways are not your ways. So as the
[1:23:30] heavens are full of the earth, so is my
[1:23:32] ways from your ways, said the Lord.
[1:23:34] Glory. Sometimes, Glory. We criticize
[1:23:36] things and get upset with some man. God
[1:23:38] said, "Well, leave it alone."
[1:23:40] &gt;&gt; You remember the man was cursing David
[1:23:42] and spitting on him and everything and
[1:23:44] God spoke out of David said, "Leave him
[1:23:46] alone. Maybe the Lord told him to do
[1:23:48] this
[1:23:49] &gt;&gt; cuz I'm looking for a blessing."
[1:23:51] &gt;&gt; Praise God. Most of us in the message,
[1:23:52] he talked about me and we be on Facebook
[1:23:54] and whatever other kind of channel we
[1:23:56] talk about. Leave that sister, that
[1:23:58] brother alone. Glory. They said this
[1:24:00] about this. Don't get quiet. Don't act
[1:24:01] like y'all holy. Y'all know what I'm
[1:24:03] talking about. Your Facebook and and
[1:24:05] YouTube channels and all that kind. It's
[1:24:07] crazy. What we need to do is get back to
[1:24:09] the word, back to the Bible. Listen, I
[1:24:12] get on my little grandson. He be on the
[1:24:13] I said, "What are you doing?" Oh, I'm
[1:24:15] looking at your I said, "If you got the
[1:24:17] you got uh uh the the table on your on
[1:24:19] your the message on your phone, what are
[1:24:21] you talking about?" I said, "From here
[1:24:22] on out, when I see you playing with
[1:24:24] that, I better see you reading by
[1:24:25] Brother Random." Glory. I better see you
[1:24:27] playing today. Glory. Now I don't know
[1:24:29] how much you do it but every time I say
[1:24:30] what you got on the phone he said oh
[1:24:32] granddad I listen to sir is this the
[1:24:34] time I said tell me what what you listen
[1:24:37] to when I get glory let church say amen
[1:24:40] but that phone glory if they don't glory
[1:24:42] they be all kind of games and everything
[1:24:44] but we want to what we want to put the
[1:24:46] right thing in their mind they may trick
[1:24:48] us sometime but at least when we check
[1:24:51] they can say they could call a title out
[1:24:53] anyway if they they can't say whole
[1:24:55] message let church say amen you got to
[1:24:57] be inspired
[1:24:58] One time, brother Brandham talks about
[1:25:00] an auctioneer. How many remember he
[1:25:02] talks about that auctioneer? He said he
[1:25:03] was trying to auction off and I like
[1:25:05] going to auction cuz I go go uh bid on
[1:25:07] cars and stuff like that. And the
[1:25:09] auctioneer he was there he said had a
[1:25:12] violin trying to auction it off. Said
[1:25:15] somebody $5, $5, somebody give me $5 $5
[1:25:19] $5. Nobody would buy auction looking
[1:25:22] said what's wrong the violin is a good
[1:25:24] instrument you know baby auction. $5.
[1:25:27] $5. He said, "A man back in the
[1:25:29] audience, he said, "Excuse me a minute,
[1:25:30] sir." He said, "All right, good." And
[1:25:32] the man came up, came up front, got the
[1:25:35] violin, and he start playing it so
[1:25:38] beautifully. Boy, they hear the music
[1:25:39] and Auctioneer got anointed. He said, "
[1:25:41] $5,000. Anybody give me $5,000?" $5,000.
[1:25:46] Glory. What? What? He said, "What
[1:25:47] happened?" The master's hand got a hold
[1:25:49] to it. He got anointed. Glory. He moved
[1:25:52] in that channel and $5,000. He just sold
[1:25:55] $5,000 when 10 minutes early he couldn't
[1:25:58] get $5 for it. What it was, it was the
[1:26:00] master's hand. It may not be what you
[1:26:02] think it is. Glory. He might be a bad
[1:26:05] brother. He might be a bad sister.
[1:26:06] Whatever. But wait till the master's
[1:26:08] hand get a hold to it. When the master
[1:26:10] hand get a hold to it, they become a
[1:26:12] bride of Jesus Christ.
[1:26:14] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:26:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:15] &gt;&gt; Glory. The message, the people in the
[1:26:18] message, they don't know what repent is.
[1:26:19] You know what repent? Pit means to turn
[1:26:21] around
[1:26:23] &gt;&gt; to change. The zeal of this hour I have
[1:26:26] to preach the message. This what I read.
[1:26:27] Glory
[1:26:28] &gt;&gt; here. The zeal of this hour is not
[1:26:31] pride.
[1:26:32] &gt;&gt; The zeal of this hour is to say I'm
[1:26:34] sorry.
[1:26:36] &gt;&gt; Glory. Jesus said, "I stand at the door
[1:26:38] and knock. If any man hear my voice, I
[1:26:41] will come into Glory." And let me tell
[1:26:43] you, preaching ain't trying to convince
[1:26:45] you to do something. Preaching is trying
[1:26:47] to get your soul saved. Preaching is
[1:26:50] trying to get you in heaven. Glory. And
[1:26:52] he said, "Let not your heart be
[1:26:53] troubled. If you believe in God," Jesus
[1:26:55] said, "believe also in me. In my
[1:26:57] father's house are many mansions. If it
[1:26:59] were not so, I wouldn't have told you. I
[1:27:01] go to prepare a place for you. And where
[1:27:03] I am, there you may be also." How many
[1:27:06] want to be where Jesus is?
[1:27:08] &gt;&gt; How many want to be where Jesus is? You
[1:27:10] have the opportunity.
[1:27:12] &gt;&gt; He's already opened the way.
[1:27:14] &gt;&gt; See, like the psalm said, "Lift up your
[1:27:16] heads, oh ye gates. be lifted up. Let
[1:27:19] the king of glory come in. Who is the
[1:27:22] king of glory? The Lord mighty in
[1:27:24] battle. He conquered death, hell, and
[1:27:25] the grave.
[1:27:27] &gt;&gt; Do you believe that? Glory. And when you
[1:27:29] rose, brother, he rose. Brother Brandham
[1:27:31] say you rose with him. When he overcame,
[1:27:33] you overcome with him. Don't let the
[1:27:35] devil push you in a corner. You a son
[1:27:37] and daughter of God. Trials going to
[1:27:39] come. Problems in life is going to
[1:27:41] happen. No, everybody have. Nobody's
[1:27:43] exempt. But one thing that you have,
[1:27:45] glory, that you can always attend, you
[1:27:47] have that Jesus Christ that promised
[1:27:49] that he will be with you always.
[1:27:51] &gt;&gt; Not sometime, always. Even to the end of
[1:27:55] the age.
[1:27:56] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[1:27:57] &gt;&gt; One time had a sister in my church been
[1:27:59] there for years. Glory. She got sick.
[1:28:02] This about two years ago. I don't know,
[1:28:03] maybe a year and a half ago. And uh but
[1:28:05] I know y'all have great testimonies.
[1:28:07] Thanks. It's good. But just want to add
[1:28:09] this in. He she was she got real sick.
[1:28:11] She was going to the hospital. The
[1:28:12] doctor couldn't find what was wrong with
[1:28:13] her. Finally, they found out that she
[1:28:15] had cancer. And then by the time she
[1:28:18] organs was breaking down, everything. So
[1:28:20] the doctor side they was going to cut
[1:28:21] her open. They cut her open.
[1:28:25] And they didn't see no. All they saw was
[1:28:28] black. Black on the inside. Sister Pam.
[1:28:33] And doctor said, "We can't do nothing."
[1:28:36] They shouldn't have even cut her open.
[1:28:37] They couldn't do nothing. They said, "We
[1:28:39] can't do nothing." Sewed her back up.
[1:28:41] They said, "Well, she ain't going to
[1:28:42] have that long to live." Her organs had
[1:28:45] quitting. Her liver had quit. Couldn't
[1:28:49] have had no didn't have no bowels,
[1:28:51] nothing. I mean, she just was totally
[1:28:52] just about gone. A month went by. She
[1:28:56] called her daughter said, "Bring her
[1:28:58] bring her daughter name is Tamila. Bring
[1:29:01] bring me something to drink." Said,
[1:29:03] "Mama, you want something to drink?"
[1:29:04] Say, "Yes, bring me something to drink."
[1:29:06] Glory to God. Hallelujah. That was the
[1:29:09] beginning. Glory. She got something to
[1:29:12] drink. Glory. A couple months went by.
[1:29:14] Anyway, she's in church now. A couple
[1:29:16] months went by. Glory. Her liver start
[1:29:18] working. Her kidneys start working. The
[1:29:21] doctors ain't know what what was going
[1:29:22] on. They said, "But let let us look at
[1:29:24] you." I said, "Brother William, don't
[1:29:26] let them touch her." Glory. God done
[1:29:28] healed her.
[1:29:30] &gt;&gt; And he stayed in the hospital about a
[1:29:31] month ago. He let us stay in there. I
[1:29:33] said, "Brother William, go get your go
[1:29:36] get your wife out the hospital. They
[1:29:37] don't know what to do. But you, we have
[1:29:39] a great position. Now is near. Is there
[1:29:42] no bomb in Gilead? Is there no position
[1:29:44] in the land? Then why not the daughters
[1:29:46] of my people healed?
[1:29:48] &gt;&gt; Glory. And she came home. Glory.
[1:29:51] Everything working. Kidneys work. She
[1:29:54] went back to work. Glory. And
[1:29:56] everything. I don't know. She close to
[1:29:58] 69. She went back to work and
[1:30:00] everything. What was it? Glory. When you
[1:30:02] believe God
[1:30:03] &gt;&gt; and you don't doubt,
[1:30:05] &gt;&gt; glory, you hold true to the word,
[1:30:07] &gt;&gt; you got to wait on God. Sometime it see
[1:30:09] like he not moving and not going to make
[1:30:11] it. It's taking too late. Don't worry
[1:30:13] about that, Glory.
[1:30:14] &gt;&gt; If he slay you, you ought to trust him
[1:30:16] anyway.
[1:30:16] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:30:17] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[1:30:18] &gt;&gt; And she got got back to work and
[1:30:19] everything supernatural. And let me tell
[1:30:22] you something. God nature is not
[1:30:25] natural. Brother Brandham said God's
[1:30:27] nature is supernatural.
[1:30:31] Glory. He does things that you think or
[1:30:34] I think it's impossible,
[1:30:36] &gt;&gt; but it's nothing is impossible for God.
[1:30:39] &gt;&gt; Glory. That's why we had a message. Look
[1:30:42] at brother Brandham. All the great
[1:30:44] miracles and look at that sister
[1:30:45] Florence night again. I know you see all
[1:30:47] these messages and and so forth. She was
[1:30:50] so skinny looked like wasn't nothing
[1:30:51] going to happen.
[1:30:53] &gt;&gt; But when God come down and prayed for
[1:30:55] her and guess what? You know what? It's
[1:30:59] Zoe on God's own life.
[1:31:02] &gt;&gt; The word is life.
[1:31:04] &gt;&gt; I know we human beings and we're
[1:31:06] limited. Glory. And and and a lot of
[1:31:08] times God heals who he wants to.
[1:31:11] &gt;&gt; Glory. Are you listening?
[1:31:13] &gt;&gt; You say, "Oh, God didn't heal my sister.
[1:31:15] God didn't heal my brother." Yeah. God
[1:31:17] heals who he wants to.
[1:31:20] &gt;&gt; And he touches who he want to. And let's
[1:31:22] just say amen.
[1:31:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. You know, brother Bam said it was
[1:31:25] wrong when said God heal everybody. No,
[1:31:27] that's wrong. He don't heal everybody.
[1:31:29] God heal who he wants to
[1:31:31] &gt;&gt; and he saves who he wants to.
[1:31:33] &gt;&gt; Glory, are you listening?
[1:31:35] &gt;&gt; You remember that maniac when it was
[1:31:37] attacking all the preachers? They said,
[1:31:38] "Brother Brandom, is he is he is he been
[1:31:40] delivered?" He says, "No." He said,
[1:31:42] "Why?" He says, "Glory." He loved that
[1:31:44] spirit that he have.
[1:31:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. God can't override your spirit. If
[1:31:48] you love what you doing, oh, let church.
[1:31:50] Amen. Can I come home now? If you love
[1:31:52] to gossip, then God ain't override that.
[1:31:54] If you love to lie, God ain't over. You
[1:31:56] got to want to stop lying. You got to
[1:31:59] want to stop smoking. You got to want to
[1:32:01] stop cutting your hair. Glory. God is
[1:32:02] not going to override your human be.
[1:32:04] Remember, you're on free moral agency.
[1:32:08] &gt;&gt; Free moral agency.
[1:32:10] &gt;&gt; God let you do what you want to do. You
[1:32:12] have to yield yourself to him.
[1:32:15] &gt;&gt; You want to be saved, glory. You got to
[1:32:16] yield yourself to him. You want to be
[1:32:18] transformed, want to be changed, glory.
[1:32:20] Then you have to yield to God.
[1:32:22] &gt;&gt; Glory. Amen. He don't make us do
[1:32:24] anything. No. Glory to God. Inspiration.
[1:32:27] Inspiration. Inspiration. Inspiration.
[1:32:30] Glory. Listen. Testimony on the sea.
[1:32:32] Y'all the message. They was there on the
[1:32:34] sea. Glory. And brother Brandon was said
[1:32:37] Jesus was in the bottom of the boat. You
[1:32:38] done heard it many times. He said, "Why
[1:32:40] is he in the bottom of the boat?" He was
[1:32:41] just down there resting, taking it easy.
[1:32:44] And they was having trouble up there.
[1:32:46] Waves and storms hitting the boat. the
[1:32:48] boat about to sink and everything they
[1:32:50] study trying to do things the itself
[1:32:52] that's just like human beings we always
[1:32:54] trying to do things ourself then when we
[1:32:57] can't get it done we want God to come
[1:32:59] help us first of all you should call on
[1:33:01] God first
[1:33:02] &gt;&gt; glory and they was jumping the water
[1:33:04] they was jumping water out then they got
[1:33:06] frustrated you know they got mad with
[1:33:07] God really they run down here well gee
[1:33:09] in other words I want to dramatize it
[1:33:11] what you doing down here sleeping you
[1:33:12] see we doing everything we can to get
[1:33:14] this water out the boat we about to s
[1:33:16] glory
[1:33:18] And they said, "Lord, you don't care
[1:33:19] that we're going to perish."
[1:33:22] And Jesus walked up on the boat, and I
[1:33:23] like how brother Brandham dramatized it.
[1:33:25] He said, "Jesus walked up on the boat,
[1:33:28] put his foot up on the hill, and he
[1:33:30] looked at the storm, and he said, "Peace
[1:33:32] be still."
[1:33:34] &gt;&gt; And he walked back down. And they said,
[1:33:37] "What manner of man is this?"
[1:33:39] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:33:40] &gt;&gt; Even the waves and the wind and the sea
[1:33:42] obey him. He was God.
[1:33:44] &gt;&gt; He was the word made flesh. All that
[1:33:47] church say amen.
[1:33:48] &gt;&gt; You said brother Brandham, you know, are
[1:33:50] you listening?
[1:33:51] &gt;&gt; Can I say something that's going to
[1:33:52] shake you? Brother Brandham, God was
[1:33:54] using brother Brandham. It wasn't
[1:33:56] brother Brandham c stop the Colorado
[1:33:58] storm. That was God hiding a vessel
[1:34:00] where he could use where his servant
[1:34:02] that he could stop the storm.
[1:34:04] &gt;&gt; You know, I found out people in the
[1:34:05] message, you know what they say, God is
[1:34:07] in you. God is in the word. But when you
[1:34:09] say God was in brother Brandham, they
[1:34:11] get the
[1:34:13] what's what's wrong? What's wrong? Who
[1:34:15] was he then? Glory. Who was in him?
[1:34:20] &gt;&gt; God used him to stop the car store
[1:34:22] coming. Just like God come in your body.
[1:34:25] You lay hands on the sick and they shall
[1:34:26] recover. If you did you to lay hands on
[1:34:29] them and heal them or did God do it?
[1:34:33] &gt;&gt; God veils himself in flesh.
[1:34:37] &gt;&gt; Glory. Oh, don't get quiet. I know
[1:34:38] everybody in the message. I I preach I
[1:34:40] preach in 38 countries. I I send this
[1:34:42] every time. Brother Brandham. Oh, glory.
[1:34:45] I can't help if your mind make you think
[1:34:46] he's God. Glory. Well, really, you not
[1:34:49] far from it, Glory. Cuz if they wouldn't
[1:34:51] have mistaken him for God, glory, then
[1:34:53] it wouldn't have been right with the
[1:34:54] scriptures cuz they mistake John for
[1:34:57] Jesus Christ.
[1:34:59] &gt;&gt; Glory. And I'm quoting you from I'm
[1:35:01] quoting you from the serpent seed.
[1:35:03] &gt;&gt; Glory. Glory. Don't don't don't don't
[1:35:04] don't
[1:35:06] be in between.
[1:35:09] &gt;&gt; If a little sister come lay hands on
[1:35:11] somebody and they heal, who healed them?
[1:35:13] That little sister did it. Then you
[1:35:15] become an idol worshipper.
[1:35:19] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory. I'm stepping on some toes.
[1:35:21] Well, he said to preach. Let me let me
[1:35:23] let me preach. I'm like home now. Glory.
[1:35:25] That's why I feel at church. Glory.
[1:35:26] Glory. But you have to be inspired. It
[1:35:29] moves you. It moves you into what God
[1:35:32] want. You know this glory. He was a
[1:35:34] thieves and we hear many times thieves
[1:35:36] on the cross. And both of them was on.
[1:35:38] Do you know both of them was on the
[1:35:39] cross. They was fussing. They said,
[1:35:41] "Listen, he's the Messiah. Let him to
[1:35:44] come down from the cross and bring us
[1:35:46] down with him. Glory. If he be the son
[1:35:49] of God, glory. Let him let him save
[1:35:52] himself and us. We both here. We need to
[1:35:54] be saved. He's got the power. They were
[1:35:56] believing he got the power. Brother Bram
[1:35:58] says they was trying to devil was trying
[1:36:00] to get him to exercise his power outside
[1:36:03] of the will of God.
[1:36:05] &gt;&gt; Oh, you mean Jesus had to follow the
[1:36:07] will of God? Yes. Glory. He was the
[1:36:09] word. He was God. And he kept and he
[1:36:13] says, you know, save yourself and us. We
[1:36:15] believe you the Messiah. Save us and
[1:36:17] yourself. And then finally, one of them
[1:36:20] got to thinking something happened to
[1:36:21] him. Glory. He had he had he had a he
[1:36:24] had something to have. I want to call it
[1:36:26] maybe a a
[1:36:29] metamorphosis or something happened to
[1:36:31] him. He he got there. He said, "Wait a
[1:36:33] minute. Wait a minute. Don't you feel
[1:36:35] God?" He said we we deserve all the
[1:36:39] things that we we deserve to be on the
[1:36:41] cross. We deserve to die. This man this
[1:36:44] man that they got ha they have lied on
[1:36:47] him told all kind of things. Glory. This
[1:36:49] man he had done nothing wrong.
[1:36:52] &gt;&gt; Glory. But he says Lord he called him
[1:36:54] capital L O R D. Elohim. Lord when you
[1:36:57] get to your kingdom remember me. I
[1:36:59] wonder where did that inspiration come
[1:37:00] from? Where did it come from? God. God
[1:37:03] came and Jesus said, "Today, not
[1:37:05] tomorrow,
[1:37:06] &gt;&gt; not when you go in the grave. Today,
[1:37:08] you'll be with me in paradise."
[1:37:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:37:10] &gt;&gt; What was it?
[1:37:11] &gt;&gt; He was inspired.
[1:37:13] He was inspired.
[1:37:15] &gt;&gt; Many people. All scripture. All
[1:37:18] scripture. Glory. Brother Brandham talks
[1:37:21] about Sister Fanny Crosby. How many How
[1:37:23] many heard that?
[1:37:25] &gt;&gt; Sister Fanny Crosby. She was a great
[1:37:26] songwriter.
[1:37:28] Every song she wrote, we read sang most
[1:37:30] of her songs in in the song book and she
[1:37:33] she she kept singing and she the world
[1:37:36] wanted her gift. They saw how blessed
[1:37:38] she was sanging everything. Every time
[1:37:40] she write a song, it was anointed and
[1:37:43] they tried to give her money. They tried
[1:37:44] to sell it and then they come talk to
[1:37:46] her. They even send they send like they
[1:37:48] said scouts. Glory. Praise God. I have a
[1:37:52] grandson 68. They send scouts over there
[1:37:54] to get him. Glory. I said, "All right."
[1:37:56] I gave him a choice. I said, "You can
[1:37:58] make a lot of money or sell your
[1:37:59] birthright, whichever you want to do. I
[1:38:01] leave it up to you." Glory. He said,
[1:38:03] "What you talking about, granddaddy?" I
[1:38:05] said, "Go read about it. You can sell
[1:38:07] your birthight for a good NBA."
[1:38:12] Glory. Let church say amen. Y'all ain't
[1:38:14] think I believe this message. All right.
[1:38:16] I don't think about it. I believe all of
[1:38:18] it.
[1:38:19] &gt;&gt; Glory. I believe it. Glory. Whether it
[1:38:22] whether people understand it or not. I
[1:38:24] didn't make the choice for him. I told
[1:38:26] him to make the choice. I said, "Esau,
[1:38:28] at least you getting more than Esau. He
[1:38:30] sold his for uh some pottage. That's a
[1:38:33] slop of the world." I said, "At least
[1:38:34] you getting to maybe get a good NBA
[1:38:36] contract and you might die rich."
[1:38:39] &gt;&gt; I said, "But you got to sell your
[1:38:41] birthright." Satan ain't going to give
[1:38:42] it to you for nothing.
[1:38:43] &gt;&gt; That's what people don't understand.
[1:38:46] &gt;&gt; He gave it to Jesus. Listen, all this I
[1:38:48] give you. You can have all this. We'll
[1:38:50] have you every say signing up for every
[1:38:53] NBA team, but you got to give me
[1:38:55] something.
[1:38:56] &gt;&gt; You're not going to get it free. Glory.
[1:38:58] Glory. He said if you fall down and
[1:39:00] worship me. Glory. See, people don't
[1:39:02] understand that destiny. You when you
[1:39:04] would with the word, Glory, you not
[1:39:06] devil ain't going to give you something
[1:39:07] and ain't going to get nothing back from
[1:39:08] it. Glory. Oh, they But listen, God, you
[1:39:12] are you listening? You can come without
[1:39:14] money, without price. Salvation is free.
[1:39:18] Glory. Hallelujah. Glory, you spend
[1:39:20] money for things that cost us a lot.
[1:39:22] Glory. But salvation don't cost you
[1:39:24] nothing.
[1:39:24] &gt;&gt; Matter of fact, some people don't even
[1:39:26] pay tithe when they come to church. Let
[1:39:27] me leave that alone. But Glory,
[1:39:29] salvation don't cost you nothing.
[1:39:31] &gt;&gt; It's free.
[1:39:32] &gt;&gt; It's free.
[1:39:35] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[1:39:36] Don't sell out.
[1:39:38] &gt;&gt; No sir. Don't sell out for nothing.
[1:39:40] Glory. Glory. It may look good then, but
[1:39:43] guess what? When you inspire, the
[1:39:45] inspiration inspire you to do something.
[1:39:47] Glory. Listen, Gloria, I found that
[1:39:51] Gloria in in Memphis, Tennessee, Brother
[1:39:53] Brandham talks about the woman, the
[1:39:55] Shouite woman and things everybody talks
[1:39:57] about the plane and that's good. But one
[1:40:00] thing that struck me, she says, I am
[1:40:02] like that Shouite woman.
[1:40:05] &gt;&gt; I'm like what's in the word. How many
[1:40:06] want to be like what's in the word?
[1:40:08] &gt;&gt; Glory. If you ask anybody, you want to
[1:40:10] be Jezebel? They say, "Oh, no, no, no.
[1:40:13] You want to be Ruth?" Yes. Glory. She
[1:40:16] said, "I'm like that Shouanite woman,
[1:40:18] but Lord, I'm like the Shouite woman.
[1:40:21] But where's Elijah? If Elijah was with
[1:40:24] the first Shouite woman, then Elijah had
[1:40:26] to be here somewhere. Glory."
[1:40:28] &gt;&gt; And God says, "Since you have that kind
[1:40:29] of faith, I'm going to send him to you.
[1:40:32] &gt;&gt; I'mma show you that he's here.
[1:40:34] &gt;&gt; You believe that? It was no
[1:40:36] coincidence."
[1:40:37] &gt;&gt; Glory. God don't work by coincidence.
[1:40:40] &gt;&gt; God have a purpose for everything he
[1:40:41] does. this morning. You may think, "I
[1:40:43] just came to church here because we come
[1:40:44] here every Sunday morning to go." You
[1:40:46] have a purpose for being here. Every
[1:40:48] Sunday you come, you have a purpose for
[1:40:51] being there. Glory. And you may not
[1:40:53] know, you need every time you come, you
[1:40:56] need that word to fill in your heart and
[1:40:58] your soul.
[1:41:00] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[1:41:01] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Glory. Something like the
[1:41:03] shoe like, "Where's your life?" And God
[1:41:05] said, "Holy, wait a minute." Glory.
[1:41:08] The plane was flying. They was going
[1:41:09] back there. He said going back to
[1:41:11] Louisville the plane was God said make a
[1:41:13] detour. Pilot don't know why he said go
[1:41:16] on down to Memphis. How many know where
[1:41:17] Louisiana is in Louisiana up here? How
[1:41:21] many know what Memphis Tennessee is?
[1:41:23] &gt;&gt; Memphis Tennessee down here. That don't
[1:41:25] make no sense do it. There's plenty
[1:41:27] other places they could have flew could
[1:41:29] have flown into. But as it was going he
[1:41:31] changed here going to Louisville
[1:41:34] Kentucky. Now he's going down to Memphis
[1:41:36] Tennessee for what? Because there was a
[1:41:39] daughter of God, a bride that needed the
[1:41:42] word that needed Elijah. And God wanted
[1:41:45] to show her that Elijah was alive,
[1:41:48] &gt;&gt; that he was on the earth.
[1:41:50] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[1:41:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:51] &gt;&gt; And amen. The prophet didn't even know
[1:41:53] why. He got off the pain. He forgot his
[1:41:55] suitcase. God had already showed a
[1:41:57] vision. Let me tell you something. When
[1:41:58] God show you something's going to
[1:41:59] happen, it will be just that way.
[1:42:04] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[1:42:05] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[1:42:07] And you walked out there suitcase, you
[1:42:08] walked out the hotel, he forgot the
[1:42:10] suitcase. And let me tell you something,
[1:42:12] Gloria, that that woman,
[1:42:15] she was there
[1:42:17] up 4:00 in the morning
[1:42:21] &gt;&gt; waiting.
[1:42:24] Do all over.
[1:42:26] Praise God. Some of us fight to get to
[1:42:28] work on time.
[1:42:30] Praise God. But do all overhead.
[1:42:33] Waiting. Waiting there. Waiting. Where
[1:42:36] the God and God God didn't say I'mma
[1:42:38] send you Elijah. She asked where he is.
[1:42:41] God said I'mma make sure she know that
[1:42:43] he's here. And is he walking there? She
[1:42:46] way all over. Then when he came up when
[1:42:48] brother Brand come the vision came into
[1:42:51] reality. She saw what he looked like,
[1:42:53] what he had on, what he was wearing,
[1:42:55] what God revealed to her. Glory. Let
[1:42:57] church say amen. If God revealed
[1:42:59] something to you, it will be just that
[1:43:01] way.
[1:43:02] &gt;&gt; Glory. And she is so confident. She
[1:43:06] said, "Good morning, parson." And
[1:43:08] brother B said, "How you know I was a
[1:43:10] preacher?" He said, "Cuz he told me you
[1:43:12] was coming." Glory.
[1:43:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. If he told you he was coming,
[1:43:16] Glory, something got to happen.
[1:43:17] Something good is going to happen.
[1:43:18] Glory. And there says, "Good morning."
[1:43:20] He says, "And got to talk." He says, "I
[1:43:22] want you. My son is there. I pray for
[1:43:25] the sick and so forth. Brother Brandham,
[1:43:26] come in there." And I say this here,
[1:43:28] Gloria, especially now, my Lord, when
[1:43:32] you walked in that house, he said she
[1:43:33] had something in there that every house
[1:43:35] in America needed. Glory. Hallelujah.
[1:43:39] You could tell they've been praying. You
[1:43:42] could tell something what we need in our
[1:43:43] house. Oh, let church say amen. This
[1:43:46] young generation, glory. Don't Don't get
[1:43:48] let church say amen. Come on, young
[1:43:50] people. Glory. This young generation.
[1:43:52] Glory. You ain't got to pray more. Seek
[1:43:54] God more. Glory. Glory. Because you know
[1:43:57] what? The old folks is dying off.
[1:43:59] &gt;&gt; Mama ain't going to make you pray every
[1:44:01] day. Mama ain't going to make you read
[1:44:03] the Bible. You going to have to have
[1:44:04] something inside.
[1:44:05] &gt;&gt; My goodness.
[1:44:06] &gt;&gt; You going to have to have it there. It's
[1:44:07] not going to come just cuz you're glory.
[1:44:10] &gt;&gt; He said she had something you could feel
[1:44:12] the presence of God. Glory. My goodness.
[1:44:16] You ought to walk in a believer's house.
[1:44:18] Glory. You ought to feel the presence of
[1:44:20] God.
[1:44:21] &gt;&gt; Praise God. Yes. Yeah. No matter you
[1:44:24] walk in the church,
[1:44:25] &gt;&gt; I like going there when I see Glory.
[1:44:27] This just my assessment so don't take it
[1:44:29] person. I walk in the church when I see
[1:44:31] brother Brandham picture hanging in
[1:44:32] there. I said at least they got his
[1:44:34] picture hanging in there. Praise God.
[1:44:35] Glory. Him and Jesus.
[1:44:38] Somebody said I you know as over the
[1:44:41] years you go through all kind of things
[1:44:42] people saying this that and that go
[1:44:43] glory. You don't want to be fooling with
[1:44:45] that. But the thing that I like, Glory,
[1:44:48] Glory, when I see that P pillar fire,
[1:44:50] that seven angel to come out of
[1:44:52] eternity, I say, "Yes, Glory. The Holy
[1:44:55] Ghost is on the scene." Glory.
[1:44:57] &gt;&gt; And when he walked in today, she said,
[1:44:58] "She didn't have all those kind of
[1:44:59] pinups and everything in the house." But
[1:45:01] what she had in there, every house
[1:45:03] needs. Glory. And I like this. Glory.
[1:45:04] When I first come, my my children will
[1:45:06] tell you they grown up now. Glory. And I
[1:45:08] used to be at the house. My wife tell
[1:45:10] they they go I can go off and come back.
[1:45:13] When I walk in the house, I could tell
[1:45:15] if they played any rock and roll music.
[1:45:17] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:45:18] &gt;&gt; Glory. Because we all we did was play
[1:45:19] brother Brandham tapes. We play the
[1:45:21] music and the atmosphere and another
[1:45:23] spirit coming there. You could feel it.
[1:45:25] Glory.
[1:45:26] &gt;&gt; Praise God. Oh, don't get quiet.
[1:45:28] &gt;&gt; Glory. I used to one time I could tell
[1:45:31] who coming to my house. As my wife, I
[1:45:32] said so and so coming to the house.
[1:45:34] They'll be here in a few minutes. Glory.
[1:45:36] I said Lord what happened to that? Once
[1:45:38] more, Lord.
[1:45:39] &gt;&gt; Once more. We want more of it, Lord. We
[1:45:42] want you to reveal to We want the
[1:45:43] church. Give us one more time. You need
[1:45:45] it. I need it. We want the Holy Ghost.
[1:45:48] Glory. Not just talking about the
[1:45:49] supernatural. Not just talking about the
[1:45:51] seal. But the seals got to become a
[1:45:53] reality in the bride. You must be the
[1:45:55] word. Glory. God seal you up by the Holy
[1:45:58] Ghost. Now, the word and the bride must
[1:46:01] become one.
[1:46:02] &gt;&gt; Glory. That's what this message is for.
[1:46:04] I hear brothers say, "Oh, you got to
[1:46:06] listen to the tape. You got to listen to
[1:46:07] the tape. You got That's good. But the
[1:46:09] word got to become you." He was the
[1:46:11] word. The image of the very invisible
[1:46:14] God must come a reality to you and me.
[1:46:17] And I'm not just saying that. Glory. No.
[1:46:20] Glory. God got to become a reality.
[1:46:23] He can walk. God can talk. God can
[1:46:26] speak.
[1:46:28] &gt;&gt; Glory. He came to Abraham house. Brother
[1:46:30] Brown said he ate.
[1:46:32] &gt;&gt; Glory. Come out ate. You drunk milk.
[1:46:35] &gt;&gt; God can write.
[1:46:37] &gt;&gt; Glory. He's still God today. Reason why
[1:46:40] I'm going saying this because sometime
[1:46:41] we get in church move we don't realize
[1:46:43] we come here to see Jesus and the word
[1:46:46] brings him on the scene. What brother
[1:46:49] said calling Jesus on the scene.
[1:46:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:54] &gt;&gt; Glory that church say amen.
[1:46:57] I met years ago covering this message.
[1:47:02] You know, Gloria eight I mean me and
[1:47:05] brother Jason was young so you know me
[1:47:07] got I met him long time long Gloria I
[1:47:12] ain't ashamed I'm 68 now and I'm tell
[1:47:14] you what I'm like Caleb I was young when
[1:47:17] I first came in and I'm old and let me
[1:47:20] tell you something is more powerful now
[1:47:21] than when I first heard it. Glory I can
[1:47:24] see the vindication of everything
[1:47:26] brother Brandham said.
[1:47:27] &gt;&gt; Glory glory now. Glory somebody can talk
[1:47:30] to you about it. talk you out of it.
[1:47:32] Glory. Praise God. Explain it. Let
[1:47:34] church. Amen. I don't hear. I don't hear
[1:47:36] to explain the thunders. Explain this
[1:47:38] here. But can you bring him on the
[1:47:40] scene?
[1:47:41] &gt;&gt; Glory. When you and when him and me
[1:47:43] meet, when two omnipotent meet,
[1:47:45] something have to happen. When you come
[1:47:47] in church, Glory, and you, you know,
[1:47:49] people think, "Oh, it's got to be all
[1:47:50] supernatural. All no. When the presence
[1:47:53] of God is there, you know it's there.
[1:47:55] &gt;&gt; You ain't feeling the preacher then.
[1:47:57] You're going, you feeling the presence
[1:47:58] of the almighty God. Glory." And guess
[1:48:01] what? It'll make all evil spirits leave.
[1:48:03] All indifference leave. All everything
[1:48:05] going away. You'll feel like your glory.
[1:48:07] You'll feel free. Glory.
[1:48:09] &gt;&gt; And he who the son set free is free
[1:48:11] indeed.
[1:48:12] &gt;&gt; Glory. Said, "Oh, I was preaching one
[1:48:15] time in in England." I said, they said,
[1:48:17] "Are we in the message? We Abraham
[1:48:19] seed." I said, "Well, if you Abraham
[1:48:20] children, then you believe everything
[1:48:22] brother Brandham said." Glory.
[1:48:24] &gt;&gt; That church say amen. And I got to
[1:48:27] talking Glory. I said, "Listen, glory."
[1:48:30] They said, "We Abraham's seed." I said,
[1:48:32] "The Jews told you Abraham's seed."
[1:48:33] Jesus said, "Listen, if you was
[1:48:34] Abraham's seed, you'll believe me."
[1:48:37] &gt;&gt; Glory. And they said, "Well, you born of
[1:48:38] fornication. How you going?" He said,
[1:48:40] "Listen." Jesus let them know. Glory.
[1:48:43] Why are you trying to disbelieve or kill
[1:48:45] me or kill the effects of the word or
[1:48:47] try to kill the message if you're a
[1:48:49] message believer?
[1:48:51] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[1:48:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:53] &gt;&gt; You know, Abraham rejoiced to see my
[1:48:55] day. What? Abraham rejoiced to see you.
[1:48:59] You ain't 50 years old yet. You ain't
[1:49:01] been in the messes long. Glory. He said,
[1:49:03] "But before Abraham was, I am." Glory.
[1:49:06] In other words, I was with God before
[1:49:08] the foundation of the world. Greatest
[1:49:09] battle ever fought. Glory. You had to be
[1:49:12] with him then, or else you wouldn't be
[1:49:13] here now.
[1:49:16] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[1:49:17] &gt;&gt; I'm getting ready to close. Listen.
[1:49:20] Listen. You got to let the word inspire
[1:49:23] you.
[1:49:24] It must keep you in inspiration.
[1:49:27] &gt;&gt; The inspiration of the word. Listen,
[1:49:30] when the ch when the when they got in
[1:49:31] the I believe it's third seal and they
[1:49:35] was buying major wheat for Bali, major
[1:49:38] penny for Bali. See, they was selling
[1:49:40] prayers. They was, you know, doing all
[1:49:42] kind of church tricks. I call them going
[1:49:44] the Catholic church. God said, "You can
[1:49:46] do all that you want to do,
[1:49:49] but don't touch the oil and the wine."
[1:49:51] You know why? The oil and the
[1:49:52] stimulation from the revelation. You can
[1:49:55] touch everything, their house, their
[1:49:56] land, their but don't touch the
[1:49:58] revelation from the stimulation that I
[1:50:00] put in their soul. You won't be able to
[1:50:02] touch that. And it's still the same
[1:50:04] today. They can't touch the stimulation
[1:50:06] from revelation. He might touch your
[1:50:08] house, might touch your friends, might
[1:50:10] touch anything else. But inside of you,
[1:50:12] that deep call into the deep. There's
[1:50:14] stimulation there that glory keeps you
[1:50:17] drunk on the raft of the word of the not
[1:50:20] of the word of God. It keeps you drunk
[1:50:22] by the word of God that you never go get
[1:50:24] uh uh to a place where you won't want to
[1:50:27] serve God. Glory.
[1:50:29] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Inspired. Inspired.
[1:50:32] Inspiration. All scripture. All
[1:50:36] scripture is given by inspiration.
[1:50:40] All scripture. I had another page here.
[1:50:42] Let me let me just finish this here.
[1:50:44] Glory. I'm in Memphis, Tennessee. Glory.
[1:50:49] When brother Brandham walked in the
[1:50:50] house, you know, he started praying for
[1:50:53] us, son. He said it was dark. It was
[1:50:54] dark. It's dark. When he got finished
[1:50:56] praying, he said, "Oh, mama is lighted
[1:50:58] here."
[1:50:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:51:00] &gt;&gt; And when he said light here, he start
[1:51:02] out the door. I like what brother Brand
[1:51:04] said. She she didn't care whether he got
[1:51:06] healed or but what she didn't want him
[1:51:08] to die lost
[1:51:10] &gt;&gt; that was the main thing
[1:51:12] &gt;&gt; and said she thought oh my mama's baby
[1:51:14] her brother Brandham slipped out the
[1:51:16] door glory he going leaving glory as he
[1:51:19] walked into the airport y'all heard the
[1:51:21] story he walked in there he said he said
[1:51:23] Louisville now uh play such and such
[1:51:26] flight departing for Louisville Kentucky
[1:51:29] this is your prophet this is my prophet
[1:51:31] he said God helped the plane on the down
[1:51:34] &gt;&gt; until he got finished doing what he
[1:51:36] wanted to do.
[1:51:37] &gt;&gt; And if God can hold that up, go, how
[1:51:39] much more he can hold up anything that
[1:51:41] try to stop the bride.
[1:51:44] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:51:46] &gt;&gt; Listen,
[1:51:49] I'm like Peter. As Peter spoke the word,
[1:51:51] the Holy Ghost fell on them. I'm not
[1:51:53] make a altar call, but if God want you
[1:51:55] here, your pastor here, he can pray for
[1:51:56] you. Say, Lord, I need I need a I need
[1:51:59] to be inspired more.
[1:52:01] &gt;&gt; I just don't want you know that church.
[1:52:02] Amen. Let me tell you something. Glory.
[1:52:04] God have confidence in you. I've heard
[1:52:06] but now I see. Glory. When Job, brother
[1:52:10] Brandham says when Job, God had
[1:52:11] confidence in him. And when Job got to
[1:52:13] the place. Glory. You know, he looked at
[1:52:16] the tree, the tree died, come back
[1:52:18] again. And he said, Lord, what you care
[1:52:20] about the tree and stuff more than man?
[1:52:23] Glory. And he kept on. And I like how
[1:52:26] brother Brandham said it. Listen. And he
[1:52:28] said, "Job saw the thunder was flashed.
[1:52:31] The lightning flashed, thunder roar,
[1:52:33] wind was blowing, everything. And he
[1:52:34] lifted up out the bed. Balls all over
[1:52:36] him. He lifted up out of bed. And you
[1:52:38] know what he said? I know my redeemer
[1:52:40] liveth.
[1:52:41] &gt;&gt; And I'm going to see him." Jo, the skin
[1:52:42] worm destroyed his body. Yet in my
[1:52:45] flesh, I'm going to see him. He going to
[1:52:46] be walking on the earth one of these
[1:52:47] days. What he said? Job got inspired.
[1:52:51] &gt;&gt; The sickness didn't bother him no more.
[1:52:54] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[1:52:56] Praise God. Why? Inspiration struck him.
[1:52:59] Glory. Inspiration moves you to the
[1:53:01] channel to move God in. Glory. You can
[1:53:04] get inspired, but you got to let God
[1:53:06] move in and take control. Praise God.
[1:53:08] How many How many know that is a
[1:53:10] channel? It's a channel of inspiration.
[1:53:13] Glory. You have it. I have it.
[1:53:16] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[1:53:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:18] &gt;&gt; But we have to use it.
[1:53:21] &gt;&gt; Glory. That's all through the Bible.
[1:53:24] Esther. Glory. Let me take one that we
[1:53:27] use all the time that we not notice we
[1:53:30] we underestimate how you know Moses. How
[1:53:33] many know Moses bringing the children of
[1:53:34] Israel out of Egypt?
[1:53:36] &gt;&gt; I'm in the message of Exodus, third
[1:53:38] Exodus. He said when Moses start coming
[1:53:42] bringing them out of Egypt, God told him
[1:53:44] to go that way. Do you know that God
[1:53:48] told him to go the way of the Red Sea?
[1:53:50] And God knew the mountains on both
[1:53:52] sides. And God also probably knew and he
[1:53:55] did know that Pharaoh was gonna be
[1:53:56] chasing him.
[1:53:58] &gt;&gt; But see when God wanted he won't want
[1:54:00] won't totally control
[1:54:02] &gt;&gt; he also have total control of his
[1:54:04] prophet. And I'm going say this on the
[1:54:06] hill here don't lie. People say oh
[1:54:07] brother Brandham made mistake. That's
[1:54:09] cuz they don't know God.
[1:54:11] &gt;&gt; God don't make no mistake.
[1:54:14] &gt;&gt; Praise God. That brother said but the
[1:54:15] Bible said it was 7,000. Brother
[1:54:17] Brandham said 700. Didn't God tell them
[1:54:19] to leave it there? Glory. If God told
[1:54:21] him to leave it there, then he had a
[1:54:22] reason for leaving it there. Oh, don't
[1:54:24] get quiet. He could have erased it out.
[1:54:26] Glory. See, I I I let church say amen.
[1:54:29] I'm not getting his doctrine, but I'm
[1:54:30] trying to show you. When God says
[1:54:32] something, Glory, you can't make a You
[1:54:34] say made a mistake. God don't make no
[1:54:36] mistakes.
[1:54:37] &gt;&gt; I make mistakes. You make mistake. You
[1:54:39] can miss fire. You can do it. But glory.
[1:54:41] When God says something, he has a reason
[1:54:43] for doing it.
[1:54:44] &gt;&gt; And we have to trust God. Let church say
[1:54:46] amen. We have to trust God
[1:54:50] &gt;&gt; knowing that he have everything in his
[1:54:52] heart and mind to benefit his children.
[1:54:56] &gt;&gt; Glory. May God bless you. Let me let me
[1:54:59] let me stop. But Moses Moses as he going
[1:55:03] down he said God the people put pressure
[1:55:06] on him. You know he don't know what he
[1:55:08] doing. And Nathan and Coror
[1:55:12] glory
[1:55:13] said, "Listen, Moses,
[1:55:16] you going down by the Red Sea. How we
[1:55:18] gonna get out? Don't worry. God told
[1:55:20] him. God told me to go this way." Let
[1:55:22] church say amen. Are you following me so
[1:55:24] far?
[1:55:25] &gt;&gt; It ain't but 1:00. I usually preach at
[1:55:27] 3:00, but I'm going to let y'all out
[1:55:29] early.
[1:55:31] No. God bless you. God bless you. I
[1:55:34] don't preach about the hour. Glory.
[1:55:37] Notice. So Moses was going and as he got
[1:55:40] down by the Red Sea looked like looked
[1:55:44] like everything was getting ready to
[1:55:46] fall apart. All my efforts, everything
[1:55:48] that come out of Egypt, all they had,
[1:55:50] all they house, all they land, they had
[1:55:52] every cattle, they had everything,
[1:55:53] everything that they owned was right by
[1:55:55] the Red Sea. Nowhere to go.
[1:55:57] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen.
[1:56:00] &gt;&gt; And Moses and the people, Moses, what
[1:56:02] you going to do, Pharaoh behind? What
[1:56:04] you going to do? And all God done, he
[1:56:06] let the pillar of fire come down.
[1:56:09] &gt;&gt; It was darkness to Egypt and light to
[1:56:11] the children of Israel.
[1:56:13] &gt;&gt; And while he was standing there going,
[1:56:14] they saying, "What are we going to do?"
[1:56:16] And God, I'm going to tell you how
[1:56:17] brother Brandham said, "You know, God,
[1:56:18] how many know God is real? God is in
[1:56:21] nature." He said, God looked down at the
[1:56:23] Red Sea with angry eyes and the Red Sea,
[1:56:26] Lord, what you want me to do? Get out
[1:56:28] the way. Get out the way.
[1:56:31] &gt;&gt; And the Red Sea backed up. And they
[1:56:34] called the dry land and said, "Moses,
[1:56:36] Moses, why are you crying out to me?"
[1:56:39] Somebody, "I want my child saved. I want
[1:56:41] my children." Why are you crying out to
[1:56:43] me? I want to be a better Christian. Why
[1:56:45] are you crying out to me? Speak the
[1:56:47] word. Speak the word. Say you want it.
[1:56:52] &gt;&gt; Glory. Say you want to be closer to God.
[1:56:54] Speak the word and go forward.
[1:56:56] &gt;&gt; It hadn't changed.
[1:56:58] Now, if God got mad with his prophet,
[1:57:00] how many know God got mad with brother
[1:57:01] Brandham when he said he said, "I'm
[1:57:03] going to look for I'm going to be
[1:57:03] praying. I'm going to seek seek the
[1:57:05] Lord." And you know, people with
[1:57:06] sickness and cancer, he always prayed
[1:57:08] and sought God for it, saw a vision. And
[1:57:10] God said, "Why are you waiting on a
[1:57:12] vision?
[1:57:13] &gt;&gt; I gave you the power. Speak the word.
[1:57:16] &gt;&gt; Say what it is." God gave him the spoken
[1:57:18] word and let you know that Glory that
[1:57:19] you're not getting power just here and
[1:57:21] there. You have the power in you to
[1:57:23] create your own world and live in it.
[1:57:27] Somebody say, "I ain't done it yet."
[1:57:29] Don't worry, you'll do it. Just keep
[1:57:31] believing it.
[1:57:32] &gt;&gt; Faith come by what? Hearing. Hearing the
[1:57:35] word. God bless you. God bless you. I
[1:57:37] want to hold you. Be inspired.
[1:57:39] &gt;&gt; If you have something, you want to have
[1:57:41] Brother Jason come. Musicians come.
[1:57:43] Glory. Say, Lord, I want to get closer
[1:57:45] to you.
[1:57:46] &gt;&gt; I want to be like Samson. I want one
[1:57:48] more time. I want to really feel this
[1:57:50] message in my heart. I want you to touch
[1:57:53] me, Lord. Let's bow our heads.
[1:57:58] Oh God,
[1:58:00] as the musicians come,
[1:58:03] Lord is open.
[1:58:07] Lord, your presence is here.
[1:58:10] And Father, we thank you. I know I've
[1:58:14] been all over the place, but Lord, you

[1:58:18] individual heart,
[1:58:20] Lord. And we thank you for what you've
[1:58:22] done for us. I was so happy, glad when
[1:58:26] they said unto me, let us go into the
[1:58:27] house of the Lord. Bless this church.
[1:58:30] Bless Beth Tabernacle. Lord, the
[1:58:33] inspiration that you gave to them in
[1:58:36] this age, in this time, in this city, in
[1:58:38] this place, Lord. May the ministry go
[1:58:40] out, Lord God. It accomplish that which
[1:58:43] you sent it here to do, Lord. And we
[1:58:45] thank you for the pastor. May you bless
[1:58:48] Brother Jason with all our heart.
[1:58:50] Strengthen him, Lord. all the laborers
[1:58:53] and everybody in this church, Lord, may
[1:58:55] they understand this just not a church.
[1:58:58] But Lord, we're getting ready, making
[1:59:01] oursel ready, Lord God, to go on to be
[1:59:03] with you, Lord God. We want to go beyond
[1:59:06] the curtain time, Father.
[1:59:10] And I like that Lord when they went over
[1:59:12] there said, "These are not randoms.
[1:59:15] These are all your converts
[1:59:18] that led to Christ, that believe Christ,
[1:59:20] Lord." and bless this here church in
[1:59:23] this area, Lord. Even when they on the
[1:59:26] street passing by, may the anointing of
[1:59:27] the Holy Ghost like it was on Isuzu
[1:59:31] Street as they pass by, something shake
[1:59:33] them and anoint them, Lord, to want to
[1:59:34] come in to see what is the attraction on
[1:59:36] the mountain.
[1:59:38] &gt;&gt; Father, grant it, Lord, and bless it in
[1:59:41] the name of Jesus Christ. We thank you
[1:59:43] and give you honor and praise. Amen and

[2:04:27] never stop working. Come on, friend.
[2:04:30] Stop. Never stop working. Even when I
[2:04:35] don't feel it, you're working. Even
[2:04:40] [Applause]
[2:04:40] [Music]
[2:04:42] you never stop. You never stop working.
[2:04:46] You never stop. You never stop working.
[2:04:51] Even when I don't see it, you're
[2:04:53] working. Even when I don't feel it,
[2:04:57] you're working. You never stop. You
[2:05:00] never stop working. You never stop. You
[2:05:05] never stop working.
[2:05:07] Way maker, miracle worker, promise
[2:05:12] keeper, light in the darkness.
[2:05:16] My God, that is who you are.
[2:05:21] Oh, you're the way maker, miracle
[2:05:27] worker, promise keeper, light in the
[2:05:31] darkness.
[2:05:33] My God,
[2:05:35] &gt;&gt; that is who you are.
[2:05:39] That is who you are.
[2:05:43] That is who you are.
[2:05:48] That is who you are.
[2:05:52] That is who you are.
[2:05:56] Hallelujah.
[2:06:02] &gt;&gt; Even when you don't see him, he's
[2:06:04] working.
[2:06:06] &gt;&gt; You feel him. You might not feel him,
[2:06:07] but he's working.
[2:06:09] &gt;&gt; I'm glad he has every answer. I'm glad
[2:06:12] to have the answer to the devil's
[2:06:14] question before he can think of the
[2:06:16] question.
[2:06:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. Glory.
[2:06:20] &gt;&gt; I made so many notes I hardly know where
[2:06:22] to start.
[2:06:24] That was powerful.
[2:06:28] You know, I
[2:06:30] if if I pick two things that just move
[2:06:33] me to the core
[2:06:35] is the reality
[2:06:38] of how privileged we are to be here
[2:06:40] today to hear this word. And you know
[2:06:43] we've quoted that scripture many times
[2:06:45] for many prophets and king great
[2:06:47] prophets and kings desired to see it was
[2:06:50] not given. Here it is granted to you.
[2:06:52] Brother Benny just just added a little
[2:06:54] bit. He said many of them those great
[2:06:57] prophets great kings desired to sit in
[2:06:59] these seats
[2:07:00] &gt;&gt; in a message church and hear the great
[2:07:02] mysteries of God unfolded. It wasn't
[2:07:04] granted but it's granted to you.
[2:07:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The last bride, the final
[2:07:09] voice to the final age. Oh friends,
[2:07:12] we're privileged today. Hallelujah.
[2:07:16] &gt;&gt; You can you can want to know God.
[2:07:19] &gt;&gt; You can want to be saved. You can want
[2:07:22] to have faith.
[2:07:25] But all of these things are given by
[2:07:27] God.
[2:07:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:07:29] &gt;&gt; You can want those things. That don't
[2:07:30] mean you can get them.
[2:07:32] &gt;&gt; It's all given. It's all granted. It's
[2:07:35] all sent down. It all comes down from.
[2:07:37] And it's all the spirit of God. I just
[2:07:40] believe the Lord deserves all the praise
[2:07:42] and all the glory today. How privileged
[2:07:45] we are that he that he spoke to us
[2:07:49] today. Do you feel spoken to by the word
[2:07:51] of God?
[2:07:53] You know, I had always read that verse
[2:07:57] and I and and I guess maybe I always
[2:08:00] just read it from Matthew and and Satan
[2:08:03] saith unto him, Satan speaking to Jesus
[2:08:05] in the wilderness, "All these things
[2:08:08] will I give thee if thou wilt fall down
[2:08:12] and worship me." But today I read it, it
[2:08:16] occurred to me, and I read it from the
[2:08:18] Gospel of Luke. And the devil said unto
[2:08:21] him, "All this power will I give thee,
[2:08:25] &gt;&gt; and the glory of them, for that is
[2:08:28] delivered unto me, and to whomsoever I
[2:08:31] will give it."
[2:08:33] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[2:08:34] &gt;&gt; And he's talking about his grandson. He
[2:08:36] just told him straight up, the devil can
[2:08:38] give you that. The devil, listen,
[2:08:39] friends, if you want the world, the
[2:08:41] devil can give you that, but there's a
[2:08:43] price.
[2:08:43] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[2:08:44] &gt;&gt; It'll cost you your soul. It'll and even
[2:08:46] if it don't cost you your soul,
[2:08:48] ultimately it'll cost you scars and
[2:08:51] wounds and torment and tortures and
[2:08:54] disappointment and sad broken dreams.
[2:08:57] But I'm here to tell you something.
[2:08:58] Jesus can give you the word and give you
[2:09:01] life and give you freedom and give you
[2:09:04] deliverance.
[2:09:05] &gt;&gt; They both have the power to give. The
[2:09:08] the only one that's deciding is you and
[2:09:10] me. I choose the word.
[2:09:12] &gt;&gt; I choose power. How many want to have
[2:09:14] freedom? How many want to have the word
[2:09:17] &gt;&gt; governing our lives?
[2:09:19] &gt;&gt; Oh my goodness, brother Benny. That was
[2:09:23] too good.
[2:09:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I want you to bow your heads
[2:09:26] all over the building with me. I don't
[2:09:28] dare want to pass an opportunity like
[2:09:31] this. Even brother Benny felt in in his
[2:09:33] own heart.
[2:09:33] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:09:34] &gt;&gt; Maybe you need a fresh batch of
[2:09:36] inspiration today.
[2:09:38] &gt;&gt; Why don't you raise up a hand to God
[2:09:39] with every head bowed? Say, Lord, I need
[2:09:41] a fresh surge of the Holy Spirit in my
[2:09:44] life. Oh, I just want to put up both my
[2:09:46] hands. I want to say, Lord, I need a
[2:09:48] fresh surge. I need a fresh inspiration.
[2:09:51] Inspiration comes to the inspiraable
[2:09:54] people. Lord God, you see hands up
[2:09:56] everywhere, all over the building, I'm
[2:09:58] quite sure, out across the airwaves,
[2:10:01] hands are going up. Lord, we heard the
[2:10:03] word today. The word of truth that
[2:10:06] brings deliverance and brings freedom
[2:10:08] and brings power to sustain us in this
[2:10:11] impossible hour, this impossibly dark
[2:10:14] time. Lord, your word is more than
[2:10:17] enough. And you have desired to bless
[2:10:19] your people today.
[2:10:22] Preaching of the gospel has cast out
[2:10:25] devils. The preaching of the gospel has
[2:10:28] driven back spirits of unbelief. I felt
[2:10:31] you doing it, Lord. There's people in
[2:10:32] here right now who are at this moment
[2:10:35] free to make a choice. They might not
[2:10:36] have came here with that freedom.
[2:10:38] Spirits of the world binding their
[2:10:40] heart, not even able to have faith. But
[2:10:42] the preaching of the gospel has driven
[2:10:44] back the spirits of unbelief. And they
[2:10:46] stand right now with the liberty to
[2:10:48] choose you in your word. Oh, I pray they
[2:10:50] choose it today. Let everyone that has
[2:10:53] breath praise the Lord. Choose the Lord.
[2:10:55] Say, "I choose you, Jesus. I don't want
[2:10:58] the world. I want to be free of the
[2:11:00] world. And I want to be renewed in my
[2:11:03] spirit in the spirit of the almighty
[2:11:05] God. Grant it to us today, Lord. I'm
[2:11:08] believing, Father, hearts are being
[2:11:10] liberated today. I'm believing young
[2:11:12] people are drawing closer. I believe old
[2:11:14] people are re are rededicating their
[2:11:17] lives and we're repurposing our spirit
[2:11:19] and our heart today to serve you more
[2:11:21] fervently. Lord, I feel at the end of
[2:11:24] this service, I want to serve you more
[2:11:26] than I ever have before. I want to have
[2:11:28] more zeal. I want to have more energy
[2:11:31] for the Holy Spirit. I want to be a
[2:11:33] vessel that he can use. Oh God, we
[2:11:37] desire to be free. Lord, you have to
[2:11:41] desire it. You have to want to be free.
[2:11:44] &gt;&gt; As the minister said, God will not
[2:11:46] overstep your your will. You're a free
[2:11:49] moral agent. If you want to be free of
[2:11:52] lust, you got to want to be free of it.
[2:11:54] Lord,
[2:11:54] &gt;&gt; if you want to be free of the world, you
[2:11:56] got to want to be free. If you want
[2:11:58] deliverance, you got to want that thing
[2:12:00] binding you to be gone from your life.
[2:12:02] And if you'll do that, the Lord is here
[2:12:04] to break chains and set free.
[2:12:07] &gt;&gt; We thank you for it today, Lord God. Let
[2:12:09] the Holy Spirit confirm his word and
[2:12:12] seal the hearts and minds of your people
[2:12:14] in faith today. May it be so. Oh God, we
[2:12:18] love you. We thank you in the name of
[2:12:21] Jesus Christ. Amen. Let's sing.
[2:12:24] [Music]

[2:28:33] hand on the handle, and the Lord said,
[2:28:34] "You You're not preaching that this
[2:28:36] morning?"
[2:28:37] &gt;&gt; I was like, "Whoa, what does that mean?
[2:28:40] You're preaching that tonight. What am I
[2:28:42] preaching this morning?" What you were
[2:28:43] going to preach tonight? You're going to
[2:28:44] flip it.
[2:28:46] &gt;&gt; And that's the first moment. I'm glad.
[2:28:48] I'm glad I learned it young. I learned
[2:28:51] it within the first six months of my
[2:28:53] ministry. Just obey God. Don't even
[2:28:56] question it. Just go for it.
