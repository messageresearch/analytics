[55:23] Spirit let's begin reading here at verse
[55:25] 3 of Judges chapter 13 and the angel of
[55:30] the Lord appeared unto the woman and
[55:32] said unto her behold now they won't
[55:34] barren embarrass not but thou shalt
[55:37] conceive and bear a son now therefore
[55:39] beware I pray thee and drink not wine
[55:43] nor strong drink and eat not any unclean
[55:48] thing for lo thou shalt conceive and
[55:51] bear a son and no razor shall come on
[55:54] his head for the child shall be a
[55:55] Nazarite unto God from the womb and he
[55:58] shall begin to deliver Israel out of the
[56:01] hand of the Philistines then the woman
[56:03] came and told her husband saying a man
[56:06] of God came unto me and his countenance
[56:08] was like the countenance of an angel of
[56:10] God very terrible but I asked him not
[56:13] whence he was neither told me his name
[56:16] but he said unto me behold thou shalt
[56:19] conceive
[56:19] even beerus son and now drink no wine
[56:22] nor strong drink neither eating the
[56:23] unclean thing for the child shall be a
[56:25] Nazarite to God from the womb to the day

[57:14] chapter 13 just keep your Bible open
[57:16] through 14 and 15 and 16 we're going to
[57:20] come to a few of these scriptures here
[57:21] it's an amazing thing when you study the
[57:24] life of this man Samson and the Bible
[57:28] tells us a lot about him
[57:31] and a lot about the choices that he
[57:33] makes Samson's life is made up of many
[57:36] choices and and it led him to such a
[57:39] place of such such a such a disgrace his
[57:44] life starts out here in judges chapter
[57:46] 13 and we know the story the the light
[57:48] that the story is very well so we'll
[57:51] only touch on them just briefly but it's
[57:54] amazing because we find that choice is
[57:57] such an important thing in our life
[58:00] every decision that we make every
[58:03] judgment call that we make both large
[58:07] and small ultimately it's it's every
[58:10] choice that we make in our life has some
[58:13] form of consequence the large decisions
[58:17] the small decisions the small choices
[58:20] really life is made up of a great array
[58:24] of choices both large and small and we
[58:29] know that that we things that we listen
[58:32] to the things that we
[58:33] to come into the gates of our soul is a
[58:36] choice that we have as an individual the
[58:38] places that we go the type are the
[58:41] places where we choose employment the
[58:43] church that we go to the the police the
[58:47] place where we live the friends that we
[58:49] have and those that we choose to
[58:52] associate with these are all things that
[58:54] are our choice that God left up to us as
[58:59] many things God does for us and God
[59:01] shapes portions of our life but yet God
[59:04] still leaves it up to us to make the
[59:08] choice and to make the right one and so
[59:10] we know that in the larger grand picture
[59:12] what we find is after we look at a
[59:15] choice and we look at choice after
[59:18] choice what we notice is a pattern well
[59:21] you can look over a man like Samson's
[59:24] life and and you can you can link it
[59:27] very much with ours as the scripture
[59:29] says that these were written for our
[59:31] examples and so we learn from their
[59:35] successes and we learn from their
[59:37] mistakes the Bible says that that that
[59:40] ultimately what we find out here from
[59:43] the life of Samson is we notice with all
[59:46] choices even in our own life we begin to
[59:49] see a pattern we can watch and see a
[59:53] trajectory we can watch and see a an ebb
[59:57] and a flow of life and many of us can go
[1:00:00] down memories lane and we can begin to
[1:00:02] take account and and we could say you
[1:00:05] know not not I'm just speaking naturally
[1:00:07] here we could say that we've arrived the
[1:00:10] station that we find ourself in life
[1:00:12] we've arrived at our the life that we
[1:00:15] live now and we can look back and we
[1:00:18] could start to look at the choices and
[1:00:19] say the the circumstances are such
[1:00:22] because of a choice that was made our
[1:00:25] decision that I chose to make and and
[1:00:27] you know sometimes it's great to look at
[1:00:29] some of those things and say you know I
[1:00:32] have what I have today spiritually
[1:00:34] because of very natural choices that I
[1:00:37] made in my life you see life is made up
[1:00:40] of very sometimes serving the Lord is a
[1:00:43] very natural experience sometimes we
[1:00:46] live in the ethereal and we
[1:00:47] live in great spiritual revival but what
[1:00:50] we find is that many times some of the
[1:00:52] choices that we make that seem so
[1:00:54] insignificant is actually serving the
[1:00:58] Lord and it can feel so natural and so
[1:01:01] small and just so normal but this is
[1:01:04] exactly how God has designed our life
[1:01:07] and he's designed life that way you'll
[1:01:11] see here that Samson's life where he
[1:01:13] ended up and where we end up in life
[1:01:15] ultimately our final destination or the
[1:01:19] final result of where our life ends up
[1:01:22] is made up of small choices Sampson
[1:01:26] learns this and you could follow this
[1:01:29] throughout the entire scripture and
[1:01:30] we're gonna hold your Bible open here to
[1:01:32] Judges chapter 13 we'll continue from
[1:01:35] there to 14 but we find out that Samson
[1:01:38] the Bible says God anoints this man's
[1:01:41] life he he wasn't we know and we're not
[1:01:45] gonna spend time on this but we know he
[1:01:47] wasn't filled with the Holy Spirit as we
[1:01:48] are by the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:01:50] through in their birth but Samson was
[1:01:53] filled with the Spirit meaning that he
[1:01:55] was anointed with the Ruach or the
[1:01:58] breath of God this was an enabling that
[1:02:01] God gave it's how Samson could slay
[1:02:03] Philistines it's how Shamgar would slay
[1:02:05] the listings that God the Holy Spirit
[1:02:08] was available to David that's why he
[1:02:10] could pray in Psalms 51 depart from not
[1:02:13] for me take not thine Holy Spirit for me
[1:02:16] so there there was an anointing that
[1:02:18] came over Samson's life it was a very
[1:02:21] special anointing because the scripture
[1:02:23] says it was something he was born with
[1:02:25] that he would begin to he would begin to
[1:02:28] deliver the Israelites from their
[1:02:31] oppressors and we know that they had
[1:02:34] many oppressors the scripture says that
[1:02:36] they had lived in a state of rebellion
[1:02:39] and so now the Philistines are going to
[1:02:42] be used as God's weapon to - to
[1:02:45] persecute or to judge the nation of
[1:02:47] Israel and they're going to begin to
[1:02:49] afflict them and they're going to become
[1:02:51] a weapon against them but ultimately for
[1:02:54] a good purpose and so God says that they
[1:02:57] begin to cry and they cry out and the
[1:03:00] scripture
[1:03:01] starts here in judges 13 and God says
[1:03:03] I've heard the cries of my people and he
[1:03:05] says that I'm gonna begin to deliver
[1:03:07] them through through men through judges
[1:03:10] now the word judge actually means Savior
[1:03:13] it's not a sense of a savior like a
[1:03:15] redeemer like we find in Christ but that
[1:03:17] word Savior simply means that it begins
[1:03:20] to save the people from their
[1:03:22] afflictions so Samson was a mini Savior
[1:03:26] he was saving the people we know he
[1:03:29] spoke of the the his life spoke of many
[1:03:33] things that spoke of the inability for
[1:03:35] man to really save anybody that it would
[1:03:38] take the man Christ Jesus to do that but
[1:03:41] we see that Samson's life begins here in
[1:03:45] judges 13 in his life is a life that's
[1:03:47] anointed of God it's filled with the
[1:03:50] Spirit of God from the womb and God says
[1:03:53] you're gonna be an anointed vessel
[1:03:54] you're gonna be a consecrated vessel
[1:03:57] that Nazarite minute was a consecration
[1:03:59] it was it was it was something that
[1:04:01] would enable that that very human man to
[1:04:05] be very super human and God was gonna
[1:04:08] use this man's life but we know that the
[1:04:11] scripture says that his life is made up
[1:04:13] of one bad choice after the next bad
[1:04:16] choice after the next bad choice his
[1:04:18] life is born he's born under this
[1:04:21] Nazarite vow and god we know we could
[1:04:24] study the life of samson and we could
[1:04:26] highlight some of the victories because
[1:04:28] he had some in his life God had used him
[1:04:31] with for many good purposes and good
[1:04:33] victories in his life and the Bible only
[1:04:36] gives us certain specific details about
[1:04:38] the timeline of his life and when
[1:04:40] certain events happen but we know that
[1:04:42] there there must have been through Manoa
[1:04:44] and and they have this child and he's
[1:04:47] raised up as a deliverer and and and
[1:04:50] he's going to begin to deliver them from
[1:04:52] this oppression and the scripture says
[1:04:54] that you know that that that his life is
[1:04:57] built with the purpose in other words
[1:05:00] God had patterned her blueprinted the
[1:05:02] life of Samson God had charted a course
[1:05:04] for Samson it was his original intent or
[1:05:07] his original desire for to end up at a
[1:05:10] at a destination as the scripture says I
[1:05:13] know the plans you
[1:05:14] made for me and and that that I'll
[1:05:16] haven't expected in what the scripture
[1:05:19] saying there is that God charts the
[1:05:21] course of every life for a purpose he
[1:05:25] rose up Pharaoh for a purpose though it
[1:05:27] wasn't one that we ever want to fulfill
[1:05:30] but God raises up world leaders for
[1:05:32] purposes he rose up our life God had a
[1:05:34] pattern and a blueprint for your life
[1:05:37] and God's intent and his intention and
[1:05:40] his desire is to get you to come to that
[1:05:42] place of that pattern to where the
[1:05:45] purpose of God is fulfilled in your life
[1:05:47] but what we understand is is that though
[1:05:50] God had a pattern for Samson though he
[1:05:52] had a blueprint though he hadn't
[1:05:54] expected in yet Samson was a very real
[1:05:57] human being whose life was made up of
[1:06:00] memory his spirit was made up of a
[1:06:02] conscience of affections of reeds and
[1:06:04] reasonings and imaginations and within
[1:06:07] all of that human who's anointed and
[1:06:10] ordained with a destiny and with the
[1:06:12] blueprint and with a pattern yet there's
[1:06:14] something in the mix and it's called the
[1:06:17] power of free moral agency or the power
[1:06:21] of choice and so ultimately Samson could
[1:06:25] say God can save Samson I've destined
[1:06:28] you patterns your life I've charted your
[1:06:31] course but I'm gonna give you the choice
[1:06:33] Samson I'm gonna give you the choice of
[1:06:36] how you're gonna get there or if you
[1:06:38] will ultimately get there thank God he
[1:06:42] ultimately got there that God took his
[1:06:45] bad and made it good and we know the end
[1:06:47] of Samson's life where the scripture
[1:06:50] says he killed more destroyed more
[1:06:52] Philistines and his death and isn't as
[1:06:55] than in his entire life so God can take
[1:06:58] our permissive will and and get glory
[1:07:01] out of out of our mistakes and out of
[1:07:04] our faults and out of our failures God
[1:07:07] God we understand this by that there's a
[1:07:10] there's a truth to a predestination that
[1:07:13] we believe that there's a foreknowledge
[1:07:16] of God and that there's a predestinate
[1:07:18] that we believe our lives are
[1:07:19] predestinated but but what we have to
[1:07:22] understand is that God is still given
[1:07:24] each and every single one of us free
[1:07:27] moral agency
[1:07:28] and we ultimately choose how we're going
[1:07:31] to get to that destiny if you're an
[1:07:33] elected seat of God you couldn't take
[1:07:35] your name off no more than God could
[1:07:37] take your name off if your predestinated
[1:07:39] seat of God God will get his man God
[1:07:43] will get his woman God o get his seed
[1:07:45] but it'll be up to you as our pastor
[1:07:49] says so many times it's up to you
[1:07:51] whether you'll come there by your own
[1:07:53] choice or you'll come kicking and
[1:07:55] screaming but be assured God will get
[1:07:58] his man the Holy Spirit always gets his
[1:08:02] seed we find that very true and it
[1:08:05] played out perfectly in Samson's life
[1:08:08] he's born under this Nazarite vow oh the
[1:08:13] cost of a choice oh the cost of a choice
[1:08:17] and what a choice means it's amazing
[1:08:20] when we look at this something so small
[1:08:23] yet it can have such profound
[1:08:26] consequences as we said a Nazarite
[1:08:31] Valley it was something very special it
[1:08:34] was a spiritual vowel that you took to
[1:08:37] stay away from dead things and I want to
[1:08:40] be careful that I don't get a get too
[1:08:42] far ahead of myself here but I want to
[1:08:44] make sure that I don't miss this but
[1:08:46] Samson's life is is something here well
[1:08:50] let's just pick it up here as he follows
[1:08:52] choice bad choice after bad choice and
[1:08:55] Judges chapter 14 and your Bible if
[1:08:57] you'll turn there and at home also if
[1:09:00] you if you have a Bible there you could
[1:09:01] take that out but I want to just come to
[1:09:03] this and judges chapter 14 let's look at
[1:09:06] one of these bad choice amps and decides
[1:09:08] to make the scripture says in judges 14
[1:09:11] verse 1 and Samson went down to Timnath
[1:09:13] saw a woman in Timnath of the daughters
[1:09:16] of the Israelites now I'm glad you all
[1:09:21] have your Bibles you see Samson Hey he
[1:09:27] begins to get to this place in his life
[1:09:29] though filled with the spirit remember
[1:09:31] were preaching on the value of the
[1:09:32] Spirit here he is a place as an anointed
[1:09:35] vessel consecrated vessel has a Nazarite
[1:09:38] vow but the scripture says he goes down
[1:09:40] to Timnath
[1:09:41] and he saw a woman in Timnath of the
[1:09:44] daughters of the Philistines bad choice
[1:09:48] number one and then he the Bible says
[1:09:51] that he comes in with this with this
[1:09:53] arrogance and tells his dad and mother
[1:09:56] and verse two and said I've seen a woman
[1:09:58] in Timnath of the daughters of the
[1:10:00] daughters of the Philistines now
[1:10:02] therefore get her for me to wife what a
[1:10:05] demand he makes to his parents then his
[1:10:09] father and mother said in Amos there
[1:10:11] never a woman among he says said unto
[1:10:14] them as there never a woman among the
[1:10:16] daughters of thy brethren among all thy
[1:10:18] people all my people that thou go is to
[1:10:21] take a wife of the uncircumcised
[1:10:23] philistine and Sampson said unto his
[1:10:26] father get her for me for she pleases me
[1:10:31] well it's amazing because God sets up
[1:10:36] this warning sign in Samson's life as
[1:10:40] God always gives us a warning before
[1:10:43] judgment and his mother and his father
[1:10:46] are going to be one of the first vessels
[1:10:49] of Mercy to Sampson though he doesn't
[1:10:52] recognize it though he recognizes it
[1:10:54] just as mom and dad yet little to
[1:10:57] Sampson know this is the first vessel of
[1:11:00] Mercy that is trying to get the
[1:11:02] attention of this wayward son and they
[1:11:05] say they immediately say Sampson huh you
[1:11:08] know here's a here is there not a
[1:11:09] daughter among our own people that you
[1:11:12] would have to go to the Philistines
[1:11:13] Samson is so determined he's so adamant
[1:11:17] he's gonna have this woman and and and
[1:11:20] we noticed it was it was such a rest
[1:11:22] such a bad choice such a bad decision
[1:11:24] yet even though God tried to warn him my
[1:11:27] brother my sister the Bible says there
[1:11:30] is no temptation that they can come upon
[1:11:32] you but with that temptation God makes a
[1:11:35] way of escape he brings a vessel of
[1:11:39] mercy in your life it may be a sermon it
[1:11:42] may be a prayer from a mother may be
[1:11:44] advice from parents it may be your
[1:11:46] friend it may be a feeling of the Holy
[1:11:48] Spirit come in your life it may be a
[1:11:50] voice or something but let me let me
[1:11:53] give you what the Bible says there
[1:11:54] we'll be a way of escape but it's up to
[1:11:57] you to take that way of escape what you
[1:12:02] don't see is that Samson doesn't respond
[1:12:05] to that mercy he responds to it by just
[1:12:08] barging over it it responds to him I
[1:12:10] just kicking it out of the way and
[1:12:12] moving it out of the way oh it's very
[1:12:14] different than Joseph who the Bible says
[1:12:16] when Joseph was confronted with
[1:12:18] Potiphar's wife he ran for his life he
[1:12:22] went the other direction what was it he
[1:12:24] was resisting the devil and the Bible
[1:12:27] says resist the devil and he'll flee
[1:12:29] from you right but Samson the scripture
[1:12:35] says he just barrels right over the
[1:12:37] advice of his parents and says I'm going
[1:12:39] to take me a non message girl and and
[1:12:43] I'm gonna bring her in and I'm just
[1:12:44] gonna you know what they're gonna enter
[1:12:46] this work it'll work well let me give
[1:12:51] you the words of a prophet anything
[1:12:52] that's outside of God's line and order
[1:12:54] will fell every time I'm just gonna take
[1:12:59] her for my wife and I don't know I
[1:13:01] really can't figure out how it's gonna
[1:13:03] work I'm just gonna make it work you
[1:13:05] know it's amazing how quickly our
[1:13:07] desired human lust can cloud the vision
[1:13:11] and can cloud discernment of choice so
[1:13:14] many times were so clouded by our own
[1:13:17] desire Samson said she pleased with me
[1:13:20] well he was so clouded by this woman by
[1:13:23] a weakness you know because God had
[1:13:26] anointed Samson and God had given him
[1:13:28] and blueprinted his life but let me tell
[1:13:30] you something my brother my sister just
[1:13:32] as much as God had a plan for smurfer
[1:13:36] for Samson Satan also had a plan for
[1:13:39] Samson and just as much as God had given
[1:13:42] him strengths he also had human
[1:13:45] weaknesses and the devil studied those
[1:13:47] human weaknesses and the devil studies
[1:13:50] your human weaknesses and the devil
[1:13:53] knows what trips you up he knows what
[1:13:55] atmospheres where when you get in you
[1:13:57] have a pattern in your life to sort of
[1:13:59] go a certain direction and just as much
[1:14:01] as God had a plan for Samson Satan also
[1:14:04] had an intention and he wanted to make
[1:14:08] claim on Samson's life the scripture
[1:14:13] says he just barrels right over this
[1:14:15] decision and we're not gonna take the
[1:14:17] time here tonight but we know just the
[1:14:19] carnage that follows this choice
[1:14:24] absolute chaos follows this daughter of
[1:14:27] Timnath he's engaged to her and we know
[1:14:30] the story of the lion and he slays the
[1:14:32] line and then he goes back and sees the
[1:14:34] bees and the honey and he takes from the
[1:14:36] honey of those Beason touching a dead
[1:14:38] thing which was a Nazarite uh-uh what
[1:14:40] you absolutely can't can't do in a zoo
[1:14:43] right now you don't touch anything
[1:14:44] that's unclean or anything that's dead
[1:14:45] and then Samson comes back and we know
[1:14:48] the story of the riddle and then her
[1:14:50] brothers get involved and she's
[1:14:51] betrothed to another man
[1:14:53] and Samson ends up killing all of them
[1:14:55] this carnage and wreckage and and just
[1:14:59] go read it in Sandton judges chapter 14
[1:15:02] it just turns into such a mess we don't
[1:15:07] have the time to preach all of this
[1:15:09] tonight but I'll just make a simple
[1:15:10] statement when you're when you refuse to
[1:15:13] take the way of escape God gives you in
[1:15:16] your life a mess we'll always follow the
[1:15:20] scripture says further he goes past this
[1:15:23] we know his life comes to here upon the
[1:15:28] story comes here let me just find my
[1:15:30] place here yes and chapter 15 turn to
[1:15:35] turn to Judges chapter 15 let's go one
[1:15:37] chapter over we got to get through this
[1:15:39] quick because we have a lot to get to
[1:15:41] and I got started a little bit late so
[1:15:43] give me mercy and give me grace I need
[1:15:47] it here tonight so notice this here and
[1:15:50] judges chapter 15 let me just find my
[1:15:54] place here make sure I get to the catch
[1:15:57] the right part of the story that I want
[1:15:58] to and notice what it says here in verse
[1:16:00] 10 and it says it says here and and and
[1:16:04] and the men of Judah said why are you
[1:16:07] come up against us and the answer to
[1:16:08] bind Samson
[1:16:09] are we come up to do to him as he has
[1:16:11] done to us so because he was such a
[1:16:13] conqueror because he would had so many
[1:16:16] Spears so much
[1:16:18] with this anointing of the Spirit that
[1:16:20] God had put it upon his life
[1:16:21] the Philistines just wanted to kill him
[1:16:23] they were gonna do anything they could
[1:16:25] to get after him and as we said they
[1:16:28] would become agents of the devil they
[1:16:30] would become anointed to afflict Samson
[1:16:33] to call Samson to lose his focus to call
[1:16:36] Samson to lose his passion for the Lord
[1:16:39] and his life comes to this decision and
[1:16:41] and Judges chapter 16 it says that then
[1:16:44] went Samson to Gaza and so their harlot
[1:16:47] and went in unto her and it was told the
[1:16:50] gale I gaze I saying Samson has come
[1:16:52] hither and they come past him in and
[1:16:54] laid wait for him all night in the gate
[1:16:56] of the city they were quiet all the
[1:16:58] night saying in the morning when it's
[1:16:59] day we shall kill him and Samson lay
[1:17:01] till midnight and a rose at midnight and
[1:17:05] took the doors of the gate of the city
[1:17:07] the two posts and went away with him bar
[1:17:09] and all I remember preaching this years
[1:17:12] and years ago and I remember seeing this
[1:17:14] here in verse three and Samson lay till
[1:17:19] midnight I begin to just ponder that and
[1:17:22] try to put myself as I do many times
[1:17:24] reading these stories as I just pictured
[1:17:26] myself what was what was going through
[1:17:29] Samson's mind at this moment he's went
[1:17:34] in unto a harlot it's just a life of bad
[1:17:36] choice after bad decision after bad
[1:17:38] decision and alleys Timnath is over and
[1:17:41] that's in the past and all the wreckage
[1:17:43] and carnage not sure exactly what
[1:17:45] happened between then and now but now he
[1:17:47] finds himself going into a harlot and
[1:17:49] and and he's and the nights over and
[1:17:52] he's laying there and and and all the
[1:17:54] pleasures of the night are over and he's
[1:17:56] he's in he's laying in his bed no doubt
[1:17:59] you imagine as the scripture says he lay
[1:18:01] there till midnight now this man who who
[1:18:05] was anointed of God filled with the
[1:18:07] Spirit of God knew what it was like to
[1:18:10] operate the powers of God yet no doubt
[1:18:12] sometimes as we do many times at night
[1:18:14] we begin to take account for our life we
[1:18:17] begin to think of our choices the
[1:18:20] scripture says he lay there maybe maybe
[1:18:22] just a voice begin to speak to Samson
[1:18:25] and maybe something starting to try to
[1:18:27] break through his heart and trying to -
[1:18:29] to - to break that fallow
[1:18:31] ground of his mind the scripture says
[1:18:34] that I can't imagine what was going
[1:18:36] through Samson late till midnight
[1:18:38] can't imagine what was going through his
[1:18:40] mind maybe uh maybe there came some type
[1:18:43] of repentance I don't know maybe there
[1:18:46] came some kind of contrite us in
[1:18:49] Samson's heart as he began to just
[1:18:52] survey his life and the how am I here
[1:18:55] and lay just the winning it to a harlot
[1:18:58] and how did I find myself here Oh
[1:19:00] the fall and how great the fall was you
[1:19:03] as we do many times in our own life
[1:19:06] after we've made mistakes we begin to
[1:19:09] evaluate our decision their choices and
[1:19:12] the scripture says Samson lays to
[1:19:15] midnight when no miracle comes the
[1:19:17] strength of God comes upon him and he
[1:19:19] rips the gate in the bar put him on his
[1:19:21] shoulders and and he carries them up to
[1:19:23] the hill that's before had brawn and now
[1:19:26] at the moment of at the moment of
[1:19:28] repentance at the moment of God dealing
[1:19:31] with this heart and then God comes on
[1:19:33] the scene the Spirit alerts quicken to
[1:19:34] him and he rips the gates of the city
[1:19:36] and all of these men who were laying in
[1:19:38] wait notice the Bible says they waited
[1:19:41] they waited they were they were just
[1:19:42] going to stay there quietly
[1:19:45] all the while Samson had no clue there
[1:19:49] was always someone behind him over his
[1:19:52] shoulder waiting for the right moment to
[1:19:55] pounce waiting for the right moment for
[1:19:59] the weakness to come to such a place
[1:20:01] when his strength as when his secret is
[1:20:02] finally known Samson has no idea this
[1:20:05] he's just going through life he doesn't
[1:20:07] know that every time he's in a city
[1:20:09] there's a there's a special operations
[1:20:12] team that is trying to take him out you
[1:20:17] don't think the devil follows your life
[1:20:19] and follows my life and tries anything
[1:20:22] they can to scheme and to plant
[1:20:24] Satan is a planner he's a master planner
[1:20:27] he's a master strategist that's why the
[1:20:30] Apostle Paul says don't be ignorant of
[1:20:33] Satan's devices it was as devising his
[1:20:36] planning his scheming and Satan
[1:20:40] strategizes he watches your life he
[1:20:43] watches our life
[1:20:44] he makes in if he can if he can arrange
[1:20:46] certain circumstances to be in such a
[1:20:48] way as to as to as to attack you or to
[1:20:52] afflict you but no matter how great his
[1:20:55] repentance was there no matter how great
[1:20:57] that turning around was it must have not
[1:20:59] been very it must have not been very
[1:21:01] long because the scripture says here in
[1:21:04] verse 4 the very next verse and it came
[1:21:07] to pass afterward that he loved a woman
[1:21:11] here's another woman in his life
[1:21:13] man just woman after a woman after a
[1:21:15] woman he loved a woman in the valley of
[1:21:19] Sorek whose name was Delilah you know
[1:21:24] it's amazing because he takes this
[1:21:26] Nazarite vow and what is the Nazarite
[1:21:30] this this Nazarite vow was someone in
[1:21:33] israel who takes a vow from birth to be
[1:21:38] separated so what it is it's a
[1:21:40] separation unto the lord Nazarites
[1:21:44] wouldn't drink they wouldn't partake of
[1:21:46] any wine or any alcohol because that
[1:21:49] represented human passion er or human
[1:21:52] lust they wouldn't come into contact
[1:21:53] with anything that was dead a dead
[1:21:56] person or a dead animal
[1:21:57] they stayed away from dead things which
[1:22:02] were because what does death represent
[1:22:04] to us spiritual death that's why we stay
[1:22:06] away from dead things that's my brother
[1:22:08] man and said anything without emotion is
[1:22:10] dead and ought to be buried we don't
[1:22:12] believe in dead singing we don't believe
[1:22:14] in dead music we don't believe in dead
[1:22:16] Christian lives were alive by the Spirit
[1:22:19] of God we stay away from dead things
[1:22:23] because God's not in death he's in life
[1:22:25] and so he was to stay away from anything
[1:22:29] that did that was there they wouldn't
[1:22:31] shave their head this was a consecration
[1:22:33] it was a sign of their commitment to the
[1:22:37] life this life of separation and
[1:22:39] separated them to the Lord they were but
[1:22:42] they get they were in the world don't
[1:22:44] forget this they weren't a monk they
[1:22:47] weren't living in a monastery and we're
[1:22:50] living in some other you know as some
[1:22:52] other desert place and they came out of
[1:22:54] the shadows
[1:22:55] Severine Islands they took a Nazarite
[1:22:57] vow yet they lived in a row around it
[1:23:00] among the rest of the world they were
[1:23:04] separated yet they were there with what
[1:23:08] are we were were in the world but we're
[1:23:10] not of the world it doesn't mean I
[1:23:14] notice this here they were in the world
[1:23:16] but they were not they were separated
[1:23:18] unto God for the purpose that he had in
[1:23:21] their life
[1:23:22] you take Samuel Samuel was a Nazarite
[1:23:25] unto God he was separated holy unto God
[1:23:27] John the Baptist was a Nazarite unto God
[1:23:30] he took a consecration he was separated
[1:23:32] unto God so so you say brother Matt what
[1:23:36] is this Nazarite is there still
[1:23:37] Nazarites today you spiritually by the
[1:23:41] Holy Spirit are a Nazarite unto God you
[1:23:44] are separated unto Jesus Christ o my
[1:23:48] brother my sister hope you catch you
[1:23:50] here tonight you are a Nazarite unto God
[1:23:52] God still has people who are separated
[1:23:55] unto God he still has an elected lady
[1:23:58] who is in the world but not of the world
[1:24:00] who doesn't touch dead things who
[1:24:02] doesn't partake of worldly things she's
[1:24:05] separated to God she sir life is
[1:24:08] separated unto God she's not gonna take
[1:24:11] partake of this world or this age of
[1:24:14] this world she's gonna keep her vow to
[1:24:17] the Lord you said no matter what does
[1:24:20] she get because of that she's full of
[1:24:22] the Spirit and the Spirit of God can use
[1:24:25] and operate through this Nazarite people
[1:24:29] can you say man they're separated unto
[1:24:33] God they've received the transforming
[1:24:35] power of the Lord Satan had a plan and
[1:24:41] his plan was to rob Samson of the
[1:24:44] strength and the power that enabled his
[1:24:47] life you know there's something that
[1:24:49] enables you to live a Christian life and
[1:24:51] it's definitely not you there's
[1:24:55] something that enables you to overcome
[1:24:57] the devil and it's definitely not you
[1:24:59] it's definitely not me it's not my
[1:25:01] intellect or my doctrine or how much I
[1:25:03] study it's the power and then the
[1:25:05] enabling of the Holy Spirit we ought to
[1:25:09] that's what I'm preaching to you here
[1:25:10] tonight you ought to value the Holy
[1:25:12] Spirit in your life to put a greater
[1:25:15] value upon the Spirit being able to flow
[1:25:18] and move and operate through you it's
[1:25:20] the only thing that will enable you to
[1:25:22] live a Christian life but Satan's plan
[1:25:28] is to rob you and to D to calls you to
[1:25:31] devalue the Spirit of God in your life
[1:25:34] and then Satan's plan was to robbing
[1:25:39] through this woman Delilah do you know
[1:25:42] what do you know what Delilah's name I
[1:25:44] wanted to put it on the board but I
[1:25:45] didn't have time to get it up I'm gonna
[1:25:48] give you the the meaning of Delilah her
[1:25:50] name simply means to slack off that's
[1:25:55] what the named Delilah means it means to
[1:25:58] slack off I almost like it means to ease
[1:26:01] up and I like the pedal when you're
[1:26:04] driving a car and then you come to
[1:26:06] something and you start to ease off the
[1:26:08] gas a little bit that's what it means
[1:26:10] they're literally her name means to ease
[1:26:12] up to total titute to ease up to lose
[1:26:17] intensity to lose your intensity as a
[1:26:23] Christian is one of the most dangerous
[1:26:25] things are more vulnerable to the attack
[1:26:28] of the devil in your life I'm not
[1:26:30] speaking to sinners here right now I'm
[1:26:32] speaking to you believers who are filled
[1:26:34] with the Holy Ghost you've got to keep
[1:26:36] your intensity for the Lord you've got
[1:26:38] to keep and keep the pedal to the metal
[1:26:41] don't let up don't ease off don't slack
[1:26:44] off it means Delilah means to lose your
[1:26:50] intensity and Samson had started off so
[1:26:53] intense so strong it was such vigor with
[1:26:59] such vibrancy with such such an
[1:27:02] anointing I had tried to live a
[1:27:04] separated life to judge Israel but now
[1:27:07] the Bible says through this through this
[1:27:10] slacking off or this easing off or this
[1:27:13] letting up in Samson's life do you know
[1:27:16] that there's 20 long 20 years in
[1:27:19] Samson's life to where we don't read if
[1:27:22] you look at the
[1:27:22] numbers of his when it tells us his age
[1:27:24] 20 years and the Bible doesn't record
[1:27:29] one act of strength through this man he
[1:27:35] loses his intensity at twenty it's an
[1:27:37] amazing number we're gonna find here in
[1:27:39] just a moment it's it represents
[1:27:40] something for twenty years that's long
[1:27:44] that's a long time twenty years is a
[1:27:47] long long time for 20 years we read of
[1:27:51] nothing of the Spirit of God moving upon
[1:27:55] Samson's life there are no victories
[1:27:57] there's no great battles that take place
[1:27:59] there's no exploits no victories over
[1:28:02] over the Philistines you know you can
[1:28:06] spend a long time in lukewarmness but
[1:28:11] you say brother Matt born again bored of
[1:28:12] the Spirit of God you could spend a long
[1:28:14] time with no intensity
[1:28:17] you could spend twenty long years eased
[1:28:20] up let off slacked off no more victories
[1:28:26] you say brother man how did this happen
[1:28:28] I can't I can't tell you that but it was
[1:28:31] Jack and tell you this it was the choice
[1:28:33] that Samson chose a very human choice he
[1:28:37] lost the value of the Spirit in his life
[1:28:42] it's one thing when you lose your
[1:28:44] intensity so I don't need all come on I
[1:28:47] don't need to be that intense for the
[1:28:49] Lord uh you know this separated life I
[1:28:52] got surely there's got to be some you
[1:28:54] know I don't know what it was I don't
[1:28:55] know what kind of flirting Samson did
[1:28:57] with the devil all I know is that the
[1:29:00] Bible says he laid in the lap and lost
[1:29:03] he laid in her lap and lost his
[1:29:05] intensity you want to know what will
[1:29:09] drain your intensity lay in the lap of
[1:29:11] Delilah similar Matt was the lap of
[1:29:14] Delilah worldly pleasures worldly lusts
[1:29:17] worldly things feed on that fourth
[1:29:20] dimension so much of Hollywood in the
[1:29:22] world and and all all the all the things
[1:29:25] of the world my brother my sister you'll
[1:29:27] lose your intensity same for the matter
[1:29:29] how do I keep my intensity keep feeding
[1:29:31] on the body word of the son of man
[1:29:33] keep those tapes rolling in your house
[1:29:36] read in that Bible keep playing that
[1:29:37] music keep singing those spiritual songs
[1:29:40] why brother Matt you're putting gasoline
[1:29:42] in your engine you're putting fire the
[1:29:45] dynamic fire of the Holy Ghost in your
[1:29:47] heart
[1:29:47] I say God give me more intensity made me
[1:29:50] more zealous for yo God again don't let
[1:29:53] me let up or slack off let me push the
[1:29:56] pedal to the metal he loses his
[1:30:00] intensity he goes down to this woman in
[1:30:04] the valley of Sorek it's Philistine
[1:30:08] territory the scripture says he finds
[1:30:12] this prostitute Delilah and he and he
[1:30:16] spends the night with her we know the
[1:30:18] story the next morning Samson realizes
[1:30:21] that you know did what had happened to
[1:30:25] him and we know the story of where they
[1:30:26] come in and there's Liars and wait we
[1:30:28] don't want to take the time here in a
[1:30:29] Wednesday night but there's Liars and
[1:30:31] wait waiting to afflict him attack him
[1:30:32] and the scripture says Samson wakes up
[1:30:35] and brokest
[1:30:36] broke the the the you know the the cords
[1:30:38] that were that he was wrapped in and he
[1:30:40] and he realizes his mistake but yet his
[1:30:42] strength is still there and he says he
[1:30:45] should the Bible says he shook himself
[1:30:46] and he and he slew the Philistines that
[1:30:49] were there to kill him we know the story
[1:30:50] then the next night goes and she does
[1:30:53] the same thing all Samson all tell me
[1:30:56] where in my great strength lies and he
[1:30:58] makes up something all of you if you
[1:31:00] braid my hair and weave it is with a
[1:31:02] Weaver's beam that has never been you
[1:31:04] know dried and all this you know then
[1:31:07] I'll be has become as any other man and
[1:31:10] he falls asleep on her lap and she does
[1:31:13] it she weaves his hair and then she
[1:31:14] tells the people that are coming you
[1:31:16] know that we're laying him wait he's
[1:31:18] asleep and then they come in and she
[1:31:20] says Samson the Philistines be upon thee
[1:31:23] and the scripture record Samson broke
[1:31:26] the web and he broke that broke old all
[1:31:28] the things that she had put on him to
[1:31:30] bind him and he slew the Philistines I
[1:31:31] guess what he does the very next night
[1:31:33] he goes back in the night back in the
[1:31:35] lap of Delilah goings back to the same
[1:31:37] thing you think it was surely it would
[1:31:40] have called his attention surely he
[1:31:41] would have woke up at some point goes
[1:31:45] the next night turned that the next
[1:31:47] thing ties him Bank binds him with vines
[1:31:49] Samson the Philistines be upon thee he
[1:31:53] wakes up to repeats it does the same
[1:31:55] exact thing
[1:31:56] rinse and repeat rinse and repeat rinse
[1:31:58] and repeat going down the same pattern
[1:32:02] in the same pattern the same pattern you
[1:32:04] know what though the problem is is that
[1:32:05] with each time he loses more value of
[1:32:09] the Spirit with each time that voice of
[1:32:13] warning that voice of judgment that
[1:32:15] voice of a Samson the Philistines be
[1:32:20] upon that you don't no doubt it shook he
[1:32:22] know about it no doubt he came to
[1:32:23] himself you know like when you're woken
[1:32:25] up in the middle of the night by
[1:32:26] something you suddenly come awake you're
[1:32:28] wide awake no doubt it shook him the
[1:32:31] first time but you know every time if
[1:32:33] you hear that every single night over
[1:32:35] and over and over again that that
[1:32:37] doesn't doesn't shake you the same way
[1:32:39] it did before
[1:32:40] it doesn't alert you does it shock you
[1:32:42] the same way because it happened the
[1:32:44] night before and then and then and then
[1:32:47] it gets quieter and every time you you
[1:32:50] you you refuse the voice of the Lord for
[1:32:53] your life trying to warn your vessel of
[1:32:56] mercy that voice gets quieter and I
[1:32:59] think it's quieter Samson the
[1:33:01] Philistines be upon thee and it doesn't
[1:33:06] do anything doesn't move you then the
[1:33:08] next time Samson until before long it's
[1:33:19] why do you do that because I'm trying to
[1:33:21] illustrate to you here today that the
[1:33:23] voice of the Lord when it comes in
[1:33:24] correction is bright and loud and
[1:33:26] bursting through to your to you to your
[1:33:28] spirit but if you the Bible says the
[1:33:31] Spirit of the Lord will not always
[1:33:32] strive with man and so eventually that
[1:33:35] voice gets quieter and gets quieter and
[1:33:38] gets quieter and that voice of
[1:33:40] quick-cook conviction gets quieter and
[1:33:42] you get more used to doing the same
[1:33:44] thing over and over again no doubt
[1:33:51] Samson here is just beginning to be more
[1:33:54] load to sleep and more load to sleep and
[1:33:57] more load
[1:33:58] to sleep oh just a little bit you know
[1:34:01] just just dabble in it just a little bit
[1:34:03] you begin to flirt with it you play with
[1:34:05] fire you get burnt and he continues to
[1:34:10] go down this way and then Felicity's
[1:34:13] urged he'll notice this here they begin
[1:34:16] to urge him the entire time the Devils
[1:34:18] working behind the scenes the entire
[1:34:21] time the Philistines are waiting waiting
[1:34:24] to destroy him Oh is scheming always
[1:34:27] planning and they urged him to Lila
[1:34:29] entice him find out a secret find out
[1:34:32] his power that we may prevail against
[1:34:34] him
[1:34:34] we won't admit what was it they be what
[1:34:37] they wanted to take this man captive
[1:34:38] they wanted to bind him that's exactly
[1:34:41] what the devil wants to do to your life
[1:34:43] he wants to wrap you up and wrap you up
[1:34:46] and with it's a job he'll wrap you up if
[1:34:48] it's a career he'll wrap you up if it's
[1:34:51] a passion he'll wrap you up I don't care
[1:34:53] how harmless or seemingly innocent it
[1:34:55] seems what the devil get a hold of him
[1:34:58] he'll begin to wrap you up like a spider
[1:34:59] does interweb wrap him up and wrap him
[1:35:05] up and tell us you know let me say this
[1:35:07] D my brother my sister the tragedy of
[1:35:10] the life of Samson wasn't his his
[1:35:13] adulterous affair it wasn't it wasn't
[1:35:15] that he laid with the harlot the tragedy
[1:35:18] of Samson was not a shaven hair you read
[1:35:21] the story and she eventually eventually
[1:35:23] gives a secret and she shaves him hello
[1:35:25] it's so tragic my brother my sister you
[1:35:27] missed the tragedy the tragedy was not
[1:35:30] the sin the tragedy is this is a man who
[1:35:33] was an anointed a vessel of God that had
[1:35:35] lost the value of the Holy Spirit in his
[1:35:38] life the tragedy is that it suddenly
[1:35:42] didn't mean what it used to mean and it
[1:35:46] didn't mean I know this is a simple
[1:35:47] message here for Wednesday night but I
[1:35:49] just what the Lord placed upon his heart
[1:35:51] and then that somehow he had did that
[1:35:53] too he allowed the devil to devalue the
[1:35:56] things of God in his life the presence
[1:36:00] of God was no longer the most important
[1:36:02] thing in his life say that's the tragedy
[1:36:07] that's the tragedy of Sam's
[1:36:09] Oh
[1:36:12] Sampson woke up that morning hair had
[1:36:15] been shaved off shaven completely and
[1:36:18] the scripture says it this way says
[1:36:20] Sampson said I'll go out as other times
[1:36:22] as before and I'll shake myself and he
[1:36:25] was not he knew not that the Spirit of
[1:36:28] the Lord had departed and then he goes
[1:36:33] you know what happens after that bondage
[1:36:36] they take him captive
[1:36:38] put out his eyes take him captive Oh put
[1:36:42] out his eyes where he couldn't see they
[1:36:44] bind him with fetters of brass and
[1:36:45] brother branham said brass represents a
[1:36:47] judgment but let me say this to you
[1:36:50] Sampson was blind long before they poked
[1:36:52] his eyes out Sampson was bound with
[1:36:56] fetters of brass long before they put
[1:36:57] chains around him his life was so
[1:37:00] entangled and oh he gets to such a place
[1:37:03] in his life I want to look here at Jacob

[1:39:45] you in the palms of my hands Jesus was
[1:39:50] going to fulfill that literally one day
[1:39:52] on Calvary and he was going to engrave

[1:41:58] catch it tonight look at the example the
[1:42:00] Lord uses there's nothing like a
[1:42:03] mother's love for a baby and

[1:42:08] oh I'm just going to go ahead and you
[1:42:09] may say it's point zero zero zero zero

[1:42:14] forget her baby John says out of this
[1:42:16] I'll say yay they may forget but here's
[1:42:19] what I'm gonna say they may forget yet
[1:42:21] will I not forget the alleluia he says I
[1:42:28] never forgot forget I will not forget
[1:42:30] thee verse sixteen brother Joe behold I
[1:42:33] have grave and V I have inscribed thee
[1:42:37] that word graven means to take a pin
[1:42:39] there to take a to take a chisel and to
[1:42:42] chisel you to chisel your name and he
[1:42:45] says I have graven you in the palms of
[1:42:47] my hands every time I look at my hand
[1:42:51] I'm looking at you i have graven you in
[1:42:55] the palm of my hands then he says thy
[1:42:58] walls are continually before me thy
[1:43:04] walls are continually before me what is
[1:43:08] God saying as I walls I've graven you in
[1:43:11] the palm of my hand
[1:43:13] this word is Choma in the Greek this is
[1:43:16] in the Hebrew listen what it means it
[1:43:18] means to be joined or to be connected or
[1:43:22] to be attached this is what God is
[1:43:24] saying here it means to be joined to a
[1:43:28] wall or attached to a wall it's the same
[1:43:32] as a stonemason would interlock a brick
[1:43:35] to a brick and that's how that's how
[1:43:39] masons know when they take brick and
[1:43:40] they're gonna build a wall they lay one
[1:43:42] brick and they attach it to the next
[1:43:43] then they attach it to the next and they
[1:43:45] attach it to the next and they attach it
[1:43:47] to the next this is what God is saying
[1:43:49] I'll never forget you I'll never leave
[1:43:51] you I've joined myself to you I've
[1:43:54] attached myself to you
[1:43:56] you're one brick I'm the other brick
[1:43:58] you're one brick on the other brick I'm
[1:44:00] so intrinsically connected to you how
[1:44:03] could I forget you
[1:44:06] Oh God is saying you may for you let me
[1:44:08] get let me make sure this is clear in
[1:44:11] your mind you may give up on me but I'm
[1:44:13] never gonna give up on you I'm gonna
[1:44:15] keep preaching the Word of God to you
[1:44:17] I'm gonna keep encouraging you I'm gonna
[1:44:19] keep lifting you up I'll never forget
[1:44:21] you your walls are continually before me
[1:44:28] your I am joined to your wall now I want
[1:44:34] you to think of that and I want you to
[1:44:37] listen again to Genesis chapter 28
[1:44:39] brother Joe listen to this promise he
[1:44:42] makes Jacob verse 15 of Genesis chapter
[1:44:45] 28 yeah y'all right tonight notice verse
[1:44:49] 15 and behold
[1:44:52] Genesis chapter 28 verse 15 I'll wait
[1:44:55] for him to get it up verse 15 you're
[1:44:57] alright verse 15
[1:44:58] Genesis chapter 28 notice when he tells
[1:45:01] Jacob and behold I am with thee and will
[1:45:05] keep thee what did that with thee mean
[1:45:07] means I'm joined to you Jacob I will
[1:45:11] keep thee in all the places where there
[1:45:13] thou goest and Jacob history the Bible
[1:45:17] is gonna record that you're gonna go a
[1:45:18] lot of places that God never told you to
[1:45:22] go you're gonna you're gonna err you're
[1:45:24] gonna backslide from Bethel you're gonna
[1:45:26] backslide from this place of an altar he
[1:45:29] says but no matter where you go Jacob
[1:45:32] and you're gonna go a lot of places I
[1:45:34] never anointed you to go but I'm gonna
[1:45:36] go to Jacob because I'm connected to you
[1:45:41] I'm joined to you he says I'll be with
[1:45:45] thee and notice he says Jacob woke out
[1:45:47] of a sleep and he said surely the Lord
[1:45:49] is in this place that man and he says
[1:45:51] then I knew it not and he was afraid and
[1:45:53] said how dreadful means awesome his aids
[1:45:55] in this plays this place this is none
[1:45:57] other but the house of God and this is
[1:45:59] the gate of heaven Jacob rose up early
[1:46:01] and took the stone that he had put for
[1:46:03] his pillows set it up for a pillar and
[1:46:05] poured oil on the top of it and he
[1:46:07] called the name of that place Bethel
[1:46:09] Bethel means the house of God but the
[1:46:12] name of the city was called lose at the
[1:46:14] first and Jacob
[1:46:15] vowed a vow saying if God will be with
[1:46:17] me and will
[1:46:18] keep me in this way that I go and we'll
[1:46:20] give me bread to eat and rained and put
[1:46:22] on so that I come again to my father's
[1:46:23] house in peace then shall the Lord be my
[1:46:27] god
[1:46:29] but Jacob you didn't but Jacob you
[1:46:34] didn't stay Lord was with you but the
[1:46:38] Bible says Jacob notice this experience
[1:46:40] the spiritual experience he has the
[1:46:43] Bible says he calls this place Bethel
[1:46:45] oh what a vivid what it what a dream
[1:46:47] this man must have had at night so vivid
[1:46:50] is this dream that the Bible says he
[1:46:53] wakes up the next morning and he takes a
[1:46:56] stone and he takes oil and he's just got
[1:46:58] to do something
[1:46:59] the experience was so awesome he he
[1:47:02] listens I gotta gotta do something here
[1:47:03] this was so powerful of an experience
[1:47:06] I'm gonna I'm gonna pour oil anointing
[1:47:08] oil upon it I'm gonna set it up as a
[1:47:10] sacred stone or a sacred memorial I'm
[1:47:14] gonna call it Bethel
[1:47:15] it means the house of God what was he
[1:47:18] signifying and experience with the
[1:47:20] Spirit of God it meant something to him
[1:47:24] oh my brother my sister I can just
[1:47:27] preach right here and say the day the
[1:47:30] Lord saved me and got a hold of my life
[1:47:32] it meant something to me oh it's a
[1:47:35] special spot you should have a special
[1:47:38] place and remembrance in your mind say
[1:47:40] God you got a hold of my life you turned
[1:47:42] me around you changed my desires oh it's
[1:47:46] a memorial it's worthy of something
[1:47:50] special it's not just a common place
[1:47:54] it's a it's a it's a special place it's
[1:47:57] what they would do it's a common in the
[1:47:59] Eastern culture they would take graves
[1:48:01] and they would they would memorialize
[1:48:03] them and build shrines out of it spoke
[1:48:05] of something special it was a special
[1:48:07] place a marker it was I was a sad was a
[1:48:10] bay was a memorial it served as
[1:48:13] something that typify door represented
[1:48:16] as special experience a significance had
[1:48:20] taken place in Jacob's life oh it was a
[1:48:25] it was a reminder of this spiritual
[1:48:27] experience he had
[1:48:29] he pours the oil on the top of the
[1:48:31] Stoney's he's declaring he says Lord I'm
[1:48:34] gonna serve you as long as you'll be
[1:48:36] with me bringing me back to my father's
[1:48:38] place oh oh he gives he gives such a he
[1:48:41] gives such such a it's such an
[1:48:43] experience here but notice how
[1:48:45] disobedient this may not well I don't
[1:48:47] have the time here on Wednesday I'm just
[1:48:49] gonna have to just skip over pages of
[1:48:51] notes here just to come to what I
[1:48:53] believe the Lord wants me to and that's
[1:48:54] okay
[1:48:56] notice how disobedient Jacob becomes in
[1:48:59] his life we know the story of Jacob his
[1:49:02] name means shyster supplanter oh he just
[1:49:07] lives his entire life he sees running
[1:49:10] from God the tire life he's running for
[1:49:13] the purpose of God and and and in a
[1:49:15] struggle and he says a struggle within
[1:49:17] himself become so disobedient and though
[1:49:21] he's an anointed servant of God though
[1:49:23] God visits him in such a special way
[1:49:25] he's an anointed seasoned and anointed
[1:49:29] servant just like Samson was an anointed
[1:49:31] vessel of God God appears the helmet
[1:49:34] Bethel he appears them at this special
[1:49:36] place the significance to his mind
[1:49:39] supernaturally the Lord visits him in a
[1:49:41] dream and he sees a ladder reaching from
[1:49:44] heaven to earth and the angels of God
[1:49:46] descended and aseneth upon that ladder
[1:49:48] sees the Lord and and God says Jacob I'm
[1:49:51] with you no matter where you go I'll
[1:49:55] always be with you Jacob wherever thou
[1:49:57] goest and I will bring you back until
[1:49:59] I've accomplished my purpose in your
[1:50:02] life I'll bring you back to this place
[1:50:04] Jacob II gives him a promise I've joined
[1:50:06] myself to you I've attached myself to
[1:50:09] you I'm connected to you Jacob I'll not
[1:50:13] leave thee until I've done that which
[1:50:15] I've spoken to thee God wasn't joining
[1:50:20] he was connecting and God says I'm never
[1:50:23] gonna lose much I'm never gonna lose my
[1:50:26] focus
[1:50:27] you're gonna lose yours many times but
[1:50:30] God will never lose his focus on what he
[1:50:32] wants to do in your life God will never
[1:50:34] lose his purpose how quickly we can
[1:50:37] become so lose our focus we have
[1:50:38] ambition our gonna be so I'm gonna do
[1:50:41] this for the Lord we lose our focus God
[1:50:42] says I'm not lose
[1:50:43] my focus no matter what you do it's not
[1:50:46] gonna uh dissuade me from keeping my
[1:50:49] promise in your life it's sure it's
[1:50:52] solid it's firm I've made a plan I've
[1:50:56] made a blueprint I've charted your life
[1:50:58] I'm gonna get you there Jacob I'm not
[1:51:02] gonna leave you I'm not gonna forsake
[1:51:04] you no matter how backslidden you become
[1:51:06] in your life I'm gonna get a hold of you
[1:51:09] Jacob I'm Anne I'm attaching myself to
[1:51:11] you and Jacob wakes ups Lord is in this
[1:51:14] place and the Bible says all he says how
[1:51:16] dreadful is this place none other than
[1:51:18] by the house of God and it's amazing
[1:51:20] from that moment 20 long years
[1:51:24] just like Samson no 20 years from that
[1:51:30] experience 20 years following such a
[1:51:36] wonderful experience yet those twenty
[1:51:39] years are trial and sorrow and struggle
[1:51:44] know what it is Jacob's wrestling Jacob
[1:51:48] long before he wrestles with the Lord
[1:51:49] he's wrestling with himself and many
[1:51:54] people get to this place to where
[1:51:55] they've not won that Lord hasn't won the
[1:51:57] battle yet and they're wrestling with
[1:51:59] himself they become angry in this
[1:52:03] wrestling they become bitter Jacob was
[1:52:05] angry wasn't a person you want to be
[1:52:07] around Esau was he's always a good man
[1:52:11] Jacob wasn't a very good man but you
[1:52:14] know what the difference was Jacob was a
[1:52:16] god man
[1:52:17] he had a favor upon his life and
[1:52:20] sometimes people that are a god man has
[1:52:23] favored maybe aren't necessarily a good
[1:52:25] man but there's a good purpose in their
[1:52:28] life
[1:52:30] Jacob struggles any troubles and he
[1:52:32] trials and sorrows and he's running and
[1:52:35] he's wrestling I wish we had the time to
[1:52:37] go into some of these but we don't let's
[1:52:39] just move on Jacob settles down he
[1:52:42] leaves Bethel and he comes to this place
[1:52:44] although he had an experience in his

[1:57:00] the Bible says today is the day of
[1:57:02] salvation
[1:57:03] not tomorrow you may not have a tomorrow
[1:57:06] but the scripture says he goes and he
[1:57:08] dwells and Shechem you know what Shechem
[1:57:11] means
[1:57:14] chicca means to go back
[1:57:18] not to go back to Bethel but to
[1:57:22] backslide it means a place of burdens oh
[1:57:29] you're gonna find out how true that was
[1:57:31] brother Jacob some place of burdens any
[1:57:35] time any time you're out of the will of
[1:57:39] God and you've disobeyed the voice of
[1:57:41] the Lord huh you find yourself in a
[1:57:44] place of burdens he's gonna get into
[1:57:48] trouble
[1:57:49] we know the story in Genesis chapter the
[1:57:52] next chapter over Genesis chapter 34
[1:57:55] brother Joe verse 1 very first thing
[1:57:57] that happens here Dina the daughter of
[1:57:59] Leah she born to Jacob went out to see
[1:58:03] the daughters of the land what do you
[1:58:05] think you're you're going your children
[1:58:07] are gonna do what do you expect your
[1:58:10] children to do when you put them and all
[1:58:13] they live in the world you you put the
[1:58:16] world you're not living in the house of
[1:58:18] God you're not living in the presence of
[1:58:19] God you're not living with the token
[1:58:21] applied you're living with the world
[1:58:23] you're living with Hollywood you're
[1:58:24] putting the world always in front of
[1:58:26] them what do you expect them to do
[1:58:28] they're gonna see the daughters of the
[1:58:30] land notice what it says here she went
[1:58:33] out to see the daughters of the land
[1:58:34] verse 2 brother Joe and when Shechem the
[1:58:37] son of Haymore the hive a prince of the
[1:58:38] country sorry took her lay with her and
[1:58:40] defiled her this is the daughter of
[1:58:43] Jacob what a horrible burden he's gonna
[1:58:49] have to live with now we don't want to
[1:58:50] get into some of this but I just want
[1:58:53] you to realize because he disobeyed the
[1:58:56] voice of the Lord he's now going to live
[1:58:58] a life with burdens that scar will never
[1:59:01] leave his family remember at the
[1:59:05] beginning of the sermon we told you
[1:59:06] about the power of choice and how every
[1:59:09] choice has a consequence what a price to
[1:59:13] pay his daughters raped his house is
[1:59:17] defiled and you read the rest of the
[1:59:20] story what his brother his own sons had
[1:59:22] to go to do to get her back just to get
[1:59:24] her back and then that the story just
[1:59:28] unravels and unravels
[1:59:31] and unravels what a horrible burden
[1:59:36] Jacob has to bear do you think Jacob
[1:59:41] ever one time said you know maybe I'm
[1:59:42] out of the will of God
[1:59:44] it's amazing how our life gets so
[1:59:47] untangled we look at the mess of our
[1:59:49] life we blame the pastor we blame the
[1:59:51] preacher we blame our parents we blame
[1:59:54] the situation we blame our health we
[1:59:56] blame our job we blame we blame
[1:59:57] everybody but we never we never what do
[2:00:01] they call that interest on that when you
[2:00:03] when you look inwardly introspect you
[2:00:06] you have no introspective looking at
[2:00:08] your life there's a there's no there's
[2:00:10] no inward looking to say maybe it might
[2:00:13] have been my choices that I made you
[2:00:19] know what we would have done if we had
[2:00:20] Jacob if we were God we would have said
[2:00:21] Jacob you're getting what you deserved
[2:00:23] you didn't listen to God look at what
[2:00:26] mess you've made
[2:00:27] Oh Jacob you ought to be ashamed of
[2:00:29] yourself how differently a true father
[2:00:37] handles his children how differently God
[2:00:42] do you know that not one single word
[2:00:45] that I can find in the Bible God speaks
[2:00:48] to Jacob begin but do you know that God
[2:00:49] never mentions it one time
[2:00:51] never brings it up Jacob knew what he
[2:00:55] did wrong Jacob understood God never
[2:00:57] mentions it once he doesn't he not not
[2:01:02] one single word not a word about the
[2:01:05] murder that he did that his sons
[2:01:07] committed not not a murder about the
[2:01:09] pollution of his dog the uncleanliness
[2:01:11] and the the rape not no no nothing no
[2:01:14] guilt trip no no condemnation instead
[2:01:17] God comes to Jacob and he says in verse
[2:01:20] 3 chapter 35 for the Jo notice the word
[2:01:23] of the Lord again to Jacob in Genesis 35
[2:01:25] verse 1 and God said unto Jacob arise
[2:01:30] here it is again go up to Bethel and
[2:01:35] dwell there make an altar unto God that
[2:01:38] appeared unto thee when thou foot us
[2:01:39] from the face of thy brother here's the
[2:01:42] word of the Lord to Jacob
[2:01:45] here's the Word of God get back to the
[2:01:48] value of the Spirit of God Jacob get
[2:01:50] back to the first experience get back to
[2:01:53] the altar get back I'm not gonna mention

[2:02:01] understand the mess you've made in your
[2:02:02] life are you listening to me friends

[2:02:25] he gets rid of his idols he kicks out he
[2:02:28] he takes his family gathers them all up
[2:02:30] and he goes back to Bethel he goes back
[2:02:33] to the place that God brought him to and
[2:02:35] God restores this man he restores the
[2:02:39] value of the spirit to this man
[2:02:41] Jacob December the met why didn't God
[2:02:45] how could God how could he take a person
[2:02:49] who was so errant like Samson how could

[2:03:21] grow back again as it grinded in that
[2:03:25] prison house it's the mercy of God God
[2:03:28] says you may give up on me but I'm never
[2:03:30] gonna give up on you Samson I've got a
[2:03:32] purpose in your life and his life ends
[2:03:36] to the glory of God and Jacobs life ends

[2:08:10] from brother Nathan brian says please
[2:08:12] keep my mom in prayer a doctor visited
[2:08:15] CT scan came back she has fluid on the
[2:08:17] lungs nodules in her lungs the mass on
[2:08:20] one of her breasts doctor had my wife
[2:08:23] take her to the ER to start having all
[2:08:25] three issues checked and they wouldn't
[2:08:27] even let her come in the ER waiting room
[2:08:29] with her this is an update says they did
[2:08:32] admit her late last night and started
[2:08:34] running multiple tests this morning to
[2:08:35] try and determine what is causing all of
[2:08:38] this might be a day or two before they
[2:08:40] get the initial tests back none of us
[2:08:42] are allowed to stay with her or visit
[2:08:43] her currently due to everything going on
[2:08:45] with the quarantine apparently they are
[2:08:47] only allowing family in for near death
[2:08:49] cases or those who are completely unable
[2:08:51] to take care of themselves she's in good
[2:08:54] spirits considering and told us she's
[2:08:56] not alone because Jesus is there with
[2:08:59] her thank you amen praise the Lord for
[2:09:01] that thank you for your prayers also a
[2:09:04] request from Ezra for the brad's
[2:09:07] family relation a relative brother Brad
[2:09:11] I'm guessing here for the five month old
[2:09:15] baby Ezra appointment with GI went okay
[2:09:17] but we don't have enough answers yet
[2:09:19] Ezra got a new x-ray that the doc wasn't
[2:09:21] prepped wasn't impressed with so he's
[2:09:24] having to test on Monday they were
[2:09:26] apparently they were apparently way too
[2:09:28] many air pockets or there were
[2:09:30] apparently way too many air pockets so
[2:09:32] he's having us a sweat test to rule out
[2:09:35] cystic fibrosis and an upper GI which he
[2:09:39] can't eat for eight hours before before
[2:09:42] that so it's going to be very rough
[2:09:43] depending on what is found in those
[2:09:45] tests he will then be getting an
[2:09:47] endoscopy
[2:09:50] he barely gained from his appoint he
[2:09:52] barely gained from his appointment three
[2:09:54] weeks ago and he had just eaten so some
[2:09:57] of that was food transfer so hopefully
[2:09:59] Monday they will break grill answers
[2:10:01] we'll remember that little five month
[2:10:03] old baby from rain Davidson I've been
[2:10:06] having severe stomach flu since Sunday
