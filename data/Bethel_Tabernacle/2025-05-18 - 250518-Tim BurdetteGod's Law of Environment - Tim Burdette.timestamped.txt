[4:19] Brother Charles was probably he's in the
[4:21] fellowship hall, but he's hurting pretty
[4:23] good. Want to remember him this evening.

[4:28] morning. So, we want to thank God for
[4:29] that.
[4:37] Amen. We want to keep holding her up in
[4:39] prayer for full recovery. Let's pray.
[4:42] Father, I love you this morning. I love
[4:45] your people, Lord.
[4:47] Lord, we're so thankful that you first
[4:49] loved us. Therefore, we could turn
[4:51] around and love you, Father.
[4:54] And Lord, we had quite a blessing last
[4:56] night, last evening, worshiping you in
[4:59] song and spirit.
[5:02] And Lord, today we come for the same
[5:04] thing. To worship you in spirit and in
[5:06] truth. The gift you bring before us to
[5:09] break the bread of life. Father, move
[5:10] the man aside. Let the gift that you
[5:13] have given have free reign.
[5:16] I bless your people. Bless those that
[5:17] are streaming. Father and Lord, we want
[5:20] to remember ours that are sick and
[5:22] hurting. Whether it be physical, whether
[5:25] it be mental, whether it be hearts, we
[5:28] lift them up before you, Father. This
[5:30] life is nothing but a a trial.
[5:34] But Lord, you give us the strength to go
[5:36] through it. That we could be trophies in
[5:38] your grace cabinet. Father, as we
[5:41] collect the tithes and offerings, Lord,
[5:43] we pray you bless that cheerful
[5:44] forgiver. Lord, just let us open up our
[5:47] hearts. Surrender all that we are.
[5:49] Forgive us for our shortcomings. We
[5:50] praise you for the sacrifice that you
[5:52] made for us. In Jesus' name we pray.

[17:14] morning. Amen. Sun is shining without
[17:17] and within. We're happy to have all of
[17:20] you here in the house of God with us
[17:22] today. We had a dynamic time last night.
[17:24] Wonderful, wonderful time in the
[17:26] presence of the Lord. And I just want to
[17:27] say again how grateful I am to all the
[17:30] teams that made it possible. All of our
[17:32] local singers. And wow, I mean, y'all
[17:36] visitors don't know, but it sometimes
[17:38] we've got two or three singers that we
[17:40] just have to put on a constant rotation.
[17:43] And when we did this, our singers came
[17:45] out of the woodwork. Like, where where
[17:47] have y'all been all all my life? So,
[17:49] we're going to keep Sister Debbie and I
[17:51] done got a pack. We're going to keep
[17:52] that going. So, all y'all who rarely
[17:55] sing that sang last night are going to
[17:57] get caught on a lot more. Sister Deb,
[17:59] good to have you back. Amen. Good to see
[18:02] her back with us today.
[18:07] Amen. And we're going to get right out
[18:08] of the way and we've got some more
[18:09] singing this morning and then we're
[18:11] going to bring the preacher out and turn
[18:12] him loose. You know, last night and
[18:14] today are a little bit different today.
[18:16] The real the the main part is the word
[18:19] of God.
[18:20] And we're looking forward to that. And
[18:21] we have perfect confidence. Brother Tim,
[18:23] known him for years. I knew his daddy
[18:25] way back in the day. I didn't know him
[18:27] personally, but I remember as a as a
[18:28] young teenager hearing him minister,
[18:30] went on to be with the Lord probably 35
[18:32] years ago. Brother Tim has carried on
[18:35] and uh he had big shoes to fill and he's
[18:37] done a marvelous job. If you've never
[18:39] been over to that to that area and visit
[18:41] that church, you'd be greatly blessed.
[18:44] Amen. To do it. He's got a unique style
[18:46] of singing. He we we were last night he
[18:49] was singing brother Lennial's song, but
[18:51] of course he bdettized it cuz he
[18:54] bdetizes everything he sings. And I said
[18:57] I told my son Jonathan I we were
[18:59] chuckling over and I said, "And he don't
[19:00] care. the original artist can be sitting
[19:02] right there and he'll still do it. But
[19:06] that's what makes his sound unique and
[19:08] uh so we're we were loving all that last
[19:10] night. We're going to get brother
[19:11] Lennial. He got out of it last night.
[19:13] Had some throat problems. You good to go
[19:15] today, Brother Lennial? Praise the Lord.
[19:17] We're going to get him up here. We're
[19:18] going to start uh this morning and have
[19:21] sister Amber come. And u we sure love
[19:24] Sister Amber. I'm glad that glad that
[19:26] she has agreed to come this morning.
[19:28] She's another one of those we almost
[19:29] have to fight her to get her to sing.
[19:31] And uh she for for those of you who
[19:33] don't who don't know and there were some
[19:35] people Brother Wes was hearing this for
[19:37] the first time. This is Sister Brenda
[19:38] Lewis's daughter. And so uh we think she
[19:41] should sing all over the world, but
[19:43] we're glad we have her here. She's
[19:45] actually her and sister Caitlyn have
[19:47] started helping Brother Tony with a
[19:49] little bit of backup there in the back
[19:50] corner. We're enjoying that. Amen. But
[19:52] praise the Lord. We're so happy to have
[19:54] them and uh want her to bless us with
[19:57] the song right now. Amen.
[20:00] [Music]
[20:09] You could have chosen
[20:12] a prime minister or a king.
[20:17] [Music]
[20:18] You could have chosen
[20:22] great men in palaces
[20:25] who rule and reign.
[20:30] You could have chosen
[20:34] women of great beauty who have
[20:38] everything.
[20:43] Lord, you chose me
[20:47] and I have nothing
[20:50] that I can bring.
[20:55] All I have
[20:59] is the love you gave to me.
[21:07] All I have
[21:11] is the change you made in me.
[21:18] I have nothing
[21:22] that I can give,
[21:25] but all I want to do is live.
[21:32] in you, Lord.
[21:35] I just want to live in you.
[21:42] In the eyes of men, it seems I have no
[21:48] dreams.
[21:51] Floating down a river
[21:55] in an orless boat, it seems.
[22:01] But the guide is here and he's standing
[22:06] at the helm.
[22:10] Though you may not see him, there's a
[22:14] dove that's leading this land.
[22:20] And all I have
[22:25] is the love you gave to me.
[22:32] All I have
[22:36] is the change you made in me.
[22:44] I have nothing
[22:48] that I can give.
[22:52] But all I want to do is live.
[22:58] live
[23:00] in you, Lord.
[23:03] I just want
[23:05] to live
[23:07] in you,
[23:11] Lord. All I have
[23:15] is the love you gave to me.
[23:22] All I have
[23:25] [Music]
[23:26] is the change you made
[23:30] in me.
[23:34] I have nothing
[23:38] that I can give,
[23:41] but all I want to do is live.
[23:47] [Music]
[23:49] in you, Lord.
[23:52] I just want
[23:54] to live in you.
[24:01] [Applause]
[24:11] Up here.
[24:13] We're going to invite Brother Lennial to
[24:15] come at this time. You know,
[24:18] back in the day, I remember when I took
[24:20] my very first missionary trip. I went to
[24:23] the Philippine Islands, Brother James
[24:25] Walls, gone on to be with the Lord now,
[24:28] Brother Mike's, Brother Lloyd's dad, and
[24:32] I was in I was literally, no kidding, I
[24:34] was in a way, way back jungle area where
[24:39] just grass huts and we were holding
[24:42] services back there. And I walked into a
[24:46] grass hut and I heard a familiar voice
[24:50] and it's like brother Wes was talking
[24:51] about. They had an old cassette tape of
[24:54] Brother Lineal singing his songs with
[24:56] the with the with uh Louie and uh
[24:59] Kenneth and and I walked in there and
[25:02] here I am in the jungle of the
[25:03] Philippine Islands and they've got a
[25:05] tape of the of these guys going and I
[25:07] said, "Oh, I I know the J brothers."
[25:10] That almost became like a deity. They
[25:12] were like, "You know the Jans brothers?"
[25:14] I'm like, "Yeah, yeah, they're good
[25:16] friends of mine." Oh my goodness. We
[25:17] love it.
[25:20] So, so Brother Lineal's songs uh have
[25:23] literally went around the world,
[25:26] friends. I mean that literally. I don't
[25:28] mean that just phys figuratively. They
[25:30] have went around the world. They're sung
[25:33] and they bring comfort to the hearts and
[25:35] minds. The lyrics and things that
[25:37] brother Lennal has put together speak to
[25:39] the heart of the bride. And it's almost
[25:41] like if we could give a message to the
[25:43] world, it's almost like what brother
[25:45] Lennal is giving us the words to say. So
[25:48] I want to ask him to come at this time.
[25:49] Come on, brother Lennial. Known him for
[25:51] a long time. Amen. Praise the Lord.
[26:03] You want to use a handheld mic. Okay.
[26:08] I'll let brother John do
[26:12] it.
[26:20] [Music]
[26:30] [Music]
[26:37] You know
[26:40] us for everything
[26:43] she put on.
[26:46] And there's one called Rosemary
[26:49] that helps your memory.
[26:58] [Music]
[27:00] There's a story in the Bible.
[27:03] Oh yes.
[27:05] [Music]
[27:10] The water.
[27:16] [Music]
[27:39] Oh, glorious
[27:42] [Music]
[27:58] message.
[28:01] All is well.
[28:04] [Music]
[28:07] There is a place hallelujah perfect rest
[28:12] behind me.
[28:17] Oh, rest little ride rest.
[28:22] [Music]
[28:29] Now things
[28:31] not worked out
[28:34] like God's people thought.
[28:40] Oh, we're still here fighting
[28:44] the greatest battle ever fought.
[28:49] [Music]
[28:52] We must have faith,
[28:56] Abraham,
[28:57] knowing God's word never fails.
[29:03] If we'll trust in him, we're going to
[29:06] find all is well.
[29:12] Third verse.
[29:14] The years have slowly gone by. All
[29:18] right.
[29:20] Since we thought we'd be gone.
[29:24] [Music]
[29:25] So many become discouraged and walked
[29:28] away. Oh, but that true bride keeps
[29:32] going on.
[29:34] [Applause]
[29:36] There's so much in this message still to
[29:40] be revealed. So much is that has to
[29:44] tell.
[29:46] Oh, if we just trust in him, we're going
[29:49] to find all is well.
[29:54] Help me say, "Yes, all is well.
[30:02] All is well.
[30:08] We've heard the message. Shalom.
[30:13] All is well.
[30:17] [Music]
[30:19] There is a place of perfect rest
[30:24] [Music]
[30:25] by the veil.
[30:29] So rest the bride rest for all is well.

[31:04] call an anthem. Uh and the bride of
[31:07] Christ. Amen. That might have been the
[31:09] very song that I heard playing when I
[31:10] walked into that Philippine hut. Amen.
[31:13] Brother Wesley. Uh I'm not going to call
[31:16] him Brother Wessles, but that was his
[31:18] name when he was a bouncing baby boy in
[31:20] a play pin. And I used to play around
[31:24] with him in the play pin. And uh now
[31:26] he's big strapping young man with a
[31:28] family of his own. But the the years
[31:31] have developed a heritage between his
[31:34] family and our family. My mom and dad go
[31:37] way back with his grandparents.
[31:40] Amen. And it's meant a lot to me. My
[31:42] wife and I were even reflecting on it
[31:44] this morning. um you know because he
[31:49] my whole life from a very young age from
[31:51] a very young age I had a great I felt a
[31:53] great affinity
[31:55] um before I started preaching and then
[31:57] especially when I started preaching I
[31:59] had such an affinity with brother
[32:01] Biscll's ministry and um was close to
[32:04] that family for years actually lived up
[32:06] there in British Columbia moved up there
[32:08] as a as a teenager that's when I knew
[32:11] Wes as a baby
[32:13] and um and now here it's come full
[32:15] circle.
[32:17] And now here I was looking last night
[32:20] and here's, you know, my sons and
[32:22] daughter-in-laws and grandchildren
[32:24] sitting over at a table and here's Wes
[32:26] right in the big middle of it and
[32:27] they're all talking and laughing. I just
[32:28] thought, "Wow, the circle of life. This
[32:30] is how God has orchestrated it to have
[32:33] brother Wes come all the way back around
[32:34] and be a blessing to my family that I
[32:37] invested in." Amen. Praise the Lord.
[32:39] Amen. Amen. So the, you know, the Lord
[32:42] says, "Cast your bread upon the water."

[32:47] a while, it it it'll come back. It won't
[32:49] return void. Brother Wesley, come on. I
[32:52] think you got one you're going to do,
[32:53] and then maybe your son was going to do

[34:09] thanks for that or not, but what an
[34:11] outpouring of the Holy Spirit and uh the

[55:38] I'm looking for that.
[55:40] Especially since I'm 60 years old this
[55:43] this year.
[55:45] We all can relate to that.
[55:48] My dad passed away at 45 years old.
[55:53] Back then, didn't you know?
[55:58] I thought 45 was old.
[56:02] I'm 60
[56:04] and now I'm wondering if that's old.
[56:09] But I'm telling you, we're going to a
[56:13] another place
[56:15] and we're going to be young again.
[56:18] And I can't wait to get there.

[56:25] Have you enjoyed the weekend? Oh yeah,
[56:29] God's good to us. Ain't you friends?
[56:31] Let's sing this song. Tricius,
[56:36] I love this song.
[56:40] Go plead with your mother
[56:44] or the words of Hosea
[56:48] as they send his children to extend his
[56:52] mercy.
[56:56] So they journey down the old path that
[57:00] led to much destruction.
[57:04] All the while their loving hearts
[57:08] were hurting.
[57:12] Their hopes was crushed inside.
[57:15] Their compassion was denied.
[57:20] And the woman they so love seemed a
[57:24] stranger.
[57:27] Heartbroken
[57:29] and alone, they took the long road back
[57:34] home.
[57:36] For sin now rained and hope seemed to
[57:40] change
[57:42] her.
[57:43] One day the word was told.
[57:47] There was some slaves being sold.
[57:52] Restless heart sosian
[57:56] seeking.
[57:59] One by one they brought them in. They
[58:03] were beaten down with sin.
[58:07] Within his chest his anxious heart was
[58:11] beating.
[58:15] All at once she caught his eye.
[58:19] From his lips the bids were so high.
[58:23] She could not believe the voice that she
[58:27] could hear.
[58:28] [Applause]
[58:30] He threw judgment to take her life.
[58:34] Forever ended pain and strife. What was
[58:39] happen as she saw him drawing near
[58:45] her?
[58:46] I've come to take you home.
[58:54] Said, I know that you've done wrong.
[59:03] you. I'll give my life through the
[59:07] sorrow, the pain, and the strife.
[59:10] I cannot let you go.
[59:15] [Applause]
[59:17] Oh, we going to leave the past behind.
[59:22] [Music]
[59:26] Love conquered one more time.
[59:30] [Music]
[59:34] He took her hand and said, "There's a
[59:38] new day ahead.
[59:42] I've come to take you home.
[59:46] [Music]
[59:52] I've stood in that same place.
[59:56] Bound by sin, a broken slave.
[1:00:00] From the depths of my despair, I prayed
[1:00:04] for mercy.
[1:00:08] I heard his word. The price was paid on
[1:00:12] the cross that day he gave.
[1:00:16] And he said, "The seed of God
[1:00:20] is in
[1:00:22] me all at once. My conscious awoke.
[1:00:28] I found out seven seals broke.
[1:00:32] And I found my name revealed upon that
[1:00:36] book.
[1:00:39] The veil fell from my eyes.
[1:00:44] I looked inside
[1:00:47] and I saw that mighty God. As he was
[1:00:52] looking,
[1:00:54] he said, "I've come to take you home."
[1:01:03] Said, "I know that you've done wrong,
[1:01:08] [Music]
[1:01:11] but for you, I gave my life through the
[1:01:16] sorrow, the pain, and the strife.
[1:01:19] I cannot let you go.
[1:01:23] [Music]
[1:01:27] We going to leave the past behind.
[1:01:35] Love conquered one more time.
[1:01:43] He took my hand and said, "I've got a
[1:01:47] new day.
[1:01:51] I've come to take you home.
[1:01:56] [Music]
[1:02:07] I'm so glad of that.
[1:02:10] There's such a hope.
[1:02:13] I don't have to just have a hope like
[1:02:16] most the world has a hope, but it's a
[1:02:19] hope. And when you see the word hope in
[1:02:22] the scripture, it means there's a
[1:02:23] confidence
[1:02:24] in that hope
[1:02:27] that there's something greater than
[1:02:28] this.
[1:02:30] Brother, sister, there's something
[1:02:32] greater than what we have today.
[1:02:34] Don't you love him? Ain't he wonderful
[1:02:37] today?
[1:02:38] He's good to us, ain't he?
[1:02:43] As we go into the word,
[1:02:46] let's sing the song we closed with last
[1:02:49] night, If Not for Grace.
[1:02:52] I guess that's one of my favorite songs.
[1:02:54] It's amazing how it was wrote, but there
[1:02:58] just something about it.
[1:03:00] Would you stand with me and sing it with
[1:03:02] me today?
[1:03:06] Where would I be?
[1:03:11] You only know.
[1:03:16] I'm glad you see
[1:03:21] through eyes of love.
[1:03:27] I was a hopeless
[1:03:29] case.
[1:03:33] an empty place.
[1:03:36] [Music]
[1:03:38] If not,
[1:03:41] oh, let's say it with all your heart
[1:03:42] now.
[1:03:44] Where would I be?
[1:03:50] He only knows.
[1:03:53] [Music]
[1:03:55] I'm glad you see
[1:03:59] [Music]
[1:04:01] through eyes of love. Thank you, Lord.
[1:04:06] I was a hopeless case
[1:04:12] and in Jesus me
[1:04:18] if not.
[1:04:20] Oh, hallelujah.
[1:04:22] Listen now.
[1:04:24] And I thank you for
[1:04:29] things I cannot see.
[1:04:35] You've been a shelter
[1:04:38] in the storms of life, a shield
[1:04:43] surrounding
[1:04:44] me.
[1:04:47] And I thank you for the mercy
[1:04:52] you proided.
[1:04:58] And I know you could have walked away.
[1:05:04] You stayed a thousand times.
[1:05:10] Amazing grace,
[1:05:16] how sweet the sound
[1:05:21] I was once lost.
[1:05:27] Oh, but now I'm found.
[1:05:31] Hallelujah.
[1:05:33] I was a hopeless
[1:05:35] case,
[1:05:39] an empty place
[1:05:44] if not for grace.
[1:05:48] Listen.
[1:05:49] Oh, and I thank you for the things
[1:05:56] I cannot see.
[1:05:59] [Music]
[1:06:02] You've been a shelter
[1:06:05] in the storms of life,
[1:06:08] a shield surrounding
[1:06:11] me.
[1:06:13] And I thank you for the mercy
[1:06:18] you provided.
[1:06:24] And I know you could have walked away.
[1:06:30] You stayed a thousand times.
[1:06:37] Amazing. Great.
[1:06:41] [Music]
[1:06:43] How sweet the sound.
[1:06:48] I was once lost,
[1:06:53] but now I'm found.
[1:06:57] [Music]
[1:06:59] I was a hopeless cave,
[1:07:05] an empty place
[1:07:10] if not for grace.
[1:07:15] I was a hopeless
[1:07:18] case,
[1:07:19] [Music]
[1:07:22] an empty place
[1:07:27] if not for grace.
[1:07:31] [Music]
[1:07:40] I'm
[1:07:42] going to make it.
[1:07:47] He already said
[1:07:51] I would.
[1:07:55] I
[1:07:57] keep on trusting
[1:08:02] that he work in everything
[1:08:09] and he
[1:08:12] walks beside
[1:08:14] me
[1:08:17] and heaven
[1:08:20] my view.
[1:08:23] Oh,
[1:08:27] I'm going to make
[1:08:30] it.
[1:08:32] All the singing, little church.
[1:08:34] Hallelujah.
[1:08:36] Well,
[1:08:38] I know
[1:08:39] I'm
[1:08:41] going to make it.
[1:08:46] He's already said
[1:08:50] I could
[1:08:53] [Music]
[1:08:56] keep on trusting.
[1:09:01] He's working everything for my
[1:09:06] [Music]
[1:09:08] Oh, he
[1:09:11] walks beside
[1:09:13] me.
[1:09:16] and heaven
[1:09:18] in my view.
[1:09:22] Oh,
[1:09:25] I'm going to make it.
[1:09:31] [Music]
[1:09:38] You set the tone
[1:09:42] for this service today.
[1:09:45] Not me.
[1:09:48] You set the tone for whatever happens in
[1:09:51] this service.
[1:09:53] You set the tone.
[1:09:55] Brother Jason does it.
[1:09:57] He can do his part. Studying at home in
[1:09:59] the study, praying.
[1:10:01] These other ministers can do their part.
[1:10:04] But you set the tone.
[1:10:09] [Applause]
[1:10:18] There's anything that's possible.
[1:10:22] Amen.
[1:10:23] With God.
[1:10:26] You believe that?
[1:10:28] Anything is possible
[1:10:30] with God.
[1:10:32] Let me say it's been an honor to be here
[1:10:33] and a privilege. I appreciate being
[1:10:35] here. I try to get him to speak. just
[1:10:39] let me sit in this seat and I'd be just
[1:10:41] as happy.
[1:10:46] I know.
[1:10:48] But I still had to try.
[1:10:52] But uh to be able to speak in front of
[1:10:54] Jason and these brothers here and Jason
[1:10:57] Dear I got to meet and several I
[1:10:59] probably don't know five or six
[1:11:02] ministers here.
[1:11:04] What in the world am I doing up here?
[1:11:08] But I'll give it my best
[1:11:11] and we will have church
[1:11:14] because I done had church at the house.
[1:11:18] So this is my second service this
[1:11:20] morning.
[1:11:22] Amen. If you have your Bibles, turn with
[1:11:24] me to Ruth one for a scriptural reading.
[1:11:27] Now I I don't have all those fangle
[1:11:30] stuffs these guys use.
[1:11:33] I I don't use computers. I'm not against
[1:11:36] them. I just don't know how to use them.
[1:11:40] So, actually, Brother Jason, I went and
[1:11:43] got me one the other day. Lane said,
[1:11:45] "What you going to do?" I said, "Well,
[1:11:46] I'm going to try to start using
[1:11:48] computers." She said, "Yeah, that'll be
[1:11:50] the day.
[1:11:53] That'll be the day." And uh she said,
[1:11:56] "You can't be still long enough to use a
[1:11:58] computer." So, I don't use them. They
[1:12:02] use them nice computers and set them up
[1:12:04] and all that. And there's nothing wrong
[1:12:05] with it. Praise the Lord. But I'm o.
[1:12:11] So I hope that's all right with y'all
[1:12:13] today. And I may try to get where I can
[1:12:15] use that thing and scroll that thing. I
[1:12:17] don't know. It's not looking too good.
[1:12:21] My wife said,"Tim, there's no way.
[1:12:23] You'll never." I had a couple ministers
[1:12:26] call me said, "I tell you what, go get
[1:12:27] you one." Told me the one to buy and let
[1:12:30] me know and I'll come set it up for you
[1:12:31] and I'll show you how to use it. I ain't
[1:12:33] called him yet.
[1:12:36] So
[1:12:37] God's still good, ain't he?
[1:12:39] Amen. Amen. Ruth 1:1, I want to read a
[1:12:42] portion of scripture here and then we're
[1:12:44] going to look at a few things is so
[1:12:46] critical and so powerful and why I said
[1:12:48] that you set the the the the uh the
[1:12:51] focus of how the service will go today
[1:12:53] is upon you. I want to speak on a
[1:12:55] subject, brother Jason, on God's law of
[1:12:58] environment.
[1:12:59] God's law of environment. Brother B said
[1:13:01] God has a law.
[1:13:03] So if we come out of that law, then
[1:13:05] God's not obligated
[1:13:07] to do what he said he would do because
[1:13:10] it was us that got out of the law.
[1:13:12] Wow.
[1:13:12] Not God.
[1:13:13] You understand? And I I'll bring this
[1:13:16] about. And now I preached on this for
[1:13:18] six months at home. So I'm not going to
[1:13:21] be able to preach six months on it here.
[1:13:22] So I'm going to highlight it. Hit it
[1:13:23] quick. Fast. Have a fork. Just start
[1:13:26] eating.
[1:13:28] In the first chapter of the first verse,
[1:13:31] now it came to pass in the days when the
[1:13:33] judges ruled that there was a famine in
[1:13:35] the land and a certain man Bethlehem
[1:13:39] went to sojourn in the country of Moab.
[1:13:41] He and his wife and his two sons. May
[1:13:44] the Lord add his blessings as you're
[1:13:45] seated. I won't keep you standing.
[1:13:49] And he name of the man was Elch. And the
[1:13:51] name of his wife was Naomi. And the name
[1:13:53] of his his two his sons were uh his sons
[1:13:57] were Malon and Cleon
[1:14:00] uh Ephritus the Bethlehem Judah and they
[1:14:04] came into the country of Moab and
[1:14:06] continued there. And Elc's Naomi's
[1:14:09] husband died and she was left and her
[1:14:11] two sons. They took unto them wives of
[1:14:14] the women of Moab and the name of one
[1:14:15] was Ofra, the name of the other was
[1:14:17] Ruth. They dwelt there for 10 years.
[1:14:20] There's very familiar scripture reading,
[1:14:21] but let's just read this word. And Melon
[1:14:24] and Chillin died also both of them and
[1:14:26] their women was left of their two son,
[1:14:29] her two sons of her husband. Then she
[1:14:31] arose with her daughters-in-law when she
[1:14:33] might return to the country of Moab. For
[1:14:36] she had heard in the country of Moab how
[1:14:38] the Lord had visited his people and
[1:14:40] given them bread. I want to look at two
[1:14:42] components this morning that God has
[1:14:45] gave us. two vital components for us to
[1:14:50] have a spiritual life. We're not here on
[1:14:54] the earth just to say, "I believe God
[1:14:56] sent a prophet."
[1:14:58] I'm not here just to say, "Well, I
[1:14:59] believe the message."
[1:15:01] The devil believes in the prophet. The
[1:15:03] devil believes in the message. As I said
[1:15:05] last night, he met him quite often. But
[1:15:07] we're here for something else that's
[1:15:10] greater than just saying, "I believe the
[1:15:12] message or I believe God sent a
[1:15:13] prophet." Of course, we do believe that.
[1:15:15] But I want to look at the two vital
[1:15:17] component components of spiritual life
[1:15:20] that we have upon this earth. And those
[1:15:22] words is word or bread which means word
[1:15:26] or praise. Bethlehem means bread which
[1:15:29] is word. Judah represents praise. Now if
[1:15:32] you watch the scripture here, God is
[1:15:35] actually and I may read some more. God
[1:15:37] is actually, let me tell the story just
[1:15:38] for a few minutes. And we know that
[1:15:40] Naomi says we're going to go back home.
[1:15:42] We're going to go back to where we come
[1:15:43] from. And she says, "Well, the two
[1:15:45] daughters going to go." She said, "No,
[1:15:46] y'all stay here." And I'm paraphrasing
[1:15:48] to save time, and you can read it later.
[1:15:50] And she says, "No." She said, "I want
[1:15:51] y'all two to stay here. Uh uh uh because
[1:15:54] there's nothing there for you. I want
[1:15:55] y'all to just stay here." So, one of
[1:15:57] them said, "Well, I I'll stay here." And
[1:15:58] she said, "Well, I bid you goodbye. Will
[1:16:00] you stay here?" The other one, Ruth,
[1:16:01] says, "I'm going with you." Long story
[1:16:03] short, I'm going with you and I'm going
[1:16:05] to your your people's going to be my
[1:16:07] people. Your God's going to be my God.
[1:16:08] Wherever you lodge, I'm going to lodge.
[1:16:10] Wherever you die, I'm going to die. So
[1:16:13] she comes to that spot in her life. Now
[1:16:15] they're going back. Notice I I was
[1:16:17] listening to brother Brown what reading
[1:16:19] something brother said this morning. He
[1:16:20] said it's so amazing. He said they
[1:16:22] actually didn't have to leave
[1:16:26] Bethlehem.
[1:16:29] Go read the quote.
[1:16:32] Many stayed there.
[1:16:35] Now look at it very quickly if we could.
[1:16:38] But God is actually letting us know that
[1:16:40] if we're not in a place where we can
[1:16:43] receive bread
[1:16:45] or receive word and praise, then we're
[1:16:49] not able to sustain the life that God
[1:16:52] has given us.
[1:16:54] There has to be if God called me to this
[1:16:57] message and he called me to believe it
[1:16:59] and he called me to be a minister and he
[1:17:01] called me to be a a a singer and he
[1:17:03] called me for all these things. And I
[1:17:04] don't know why he would call me for that
[1:17:06] cuz I don't think I'm good at none of
[1:17:07] them. But yet, if he called me for that
[1:17:09] and he called you for whatever God
[1:17:11] called you for, he had to give you
[1:17:14] something to sustain you.
[1:17:16] He didn't just put you on the earth and
[1:17:18] say, "Here, believe this and go." No,
[1:17:19] there's got to be something to sustain
[1:17:22] what God placed you in.
[1:17:25] God is actually
[1:17:27] has brought the word and praise to a
[1:17:30] place of environment in which God
[1:17:32] dwells. The Bible said God inhabits the
[1:17:35] praise of his people. So there's a place
[1:17:38] where God actually dwells. Would you say
[1:17:41] amen? Now nobody here's the thing in the
[1:17:43] age and the hour we live in. If you
[1:17:45] watch the world and the environment of
[1:17:47] the world has totally changed from when
[1:17:48] I was a young boy. It's totally changed
[1:17:50] from when I remember coming up in church
[1:17:52] in 13 12 13 14 15 in daddy's church
[1:17:55] there and visiting other churches all in
[1:17:57] North Carolina and Tennessee when I was
[1:17:59] a young boy. The environment has
[1:18:01] actually changed. We live in a day where
[1:18:04] everybody wants entertainment,
[1:18:06] but yet nobody wants to participate.
[1:18:10] Well, if I can go somewhere and I I I
[1:18:12] I'll let I'm just going to use Brother
[1:18:14] Jason. I'm just going to use the church
[1:18:15] cuz this is where I'm at this morning.
[1:18:17] Well, if I can just come and hear
[1:18:18] Brother Jason and brother Matt saying
[1:18:20] and these musicians, you know, I'm just
[1:18:22] going to sit and just listen to them.
[1:18:23] Nobody want I'm not pointing this at any
[1:18:26] person. Please understand me today. You
[1:18:29] have to participate. That's right.
[1:18:32] In order to receive something from these
[1:18:35] two vital components that God has given
[1:18:38] us to have on this earth, you have to
[1:18:41] participate in this hour. Everything on
[1:18:45] earth has its own environment
[1:18:48] for it to be sustained
[1:18:51] upon this earth.
[1:18:52] Now, in Genesis 1, the Bible tells us,
[1:18:55] and I'm paraphrasing. I happen all of it
[1:18:56] wrote down, but I'm paraphrasing to the
[1:18:58] same time. It says in the beginning God
[1:19:00] created. Now notice if you go on and
[1:19:02] read further it says God made. Now God
[1:19:04] the word created and made is two totally
[1:19:07] different words. The Bible says as he
[1:19:09] created we know that he created the
[1:19:12] earth and the world and it was total
[1:19:14] darkness in Genesis 1. We find it total
[1:19:16] total chaos and just oh my it was in a
[1:19:19] mess. There was no environment for
[1:19:22] anything to live. So now God comes to
[1:19:25] the place where he begins to create
[1:19:27] things. He wants to create the vows and
[1:19:29] the fish and the different things. So he
[1:19:31] has to be able to make a water for the
[1:19:34] fish
[1:19:35] to live. Why? It's its environment. If
[1:19:39] you take a fish out of water, you take
[1:19:41] it out of its environment. That fish
[1:19:44] can't live.
[1:19:45] It will die. You understand? It's very
[1:19:48] simple. So I'm just taking a thought uh
[1:19:50] maybe just an evangelistic st thought
[1:19:52] this morning. It takes the sky when he
[1:19:54] placed all these millions of stars and
[1:19:57] galaxies and all this in the air. He
[1:19:59] placed it there and he placed all the
[1:20:01] gases in order for the stars to hang
[1:20:04] there. Why? It's in its environment.
[1:20:07] If you take it out of its environment,
[1:20:09] they will fall.
[1:20:12] They can't sustain if you take it out.
[1:20:14] The stars needed that to keep it
[1:20:17] burning. It needs all the gases of the
[1:20:20] atmosphere and the universe to keep each
[1:20:22] star and the light burning. The ground
[1:20:25] has nutrients it needs to sustain plant
[1:20:28] life. Whatever is in the ground, God
[1:20:31] knew he would need it there because
[1:20:33] there was going to be something that
[1:20:34] needed what was in the ground. So, he
[1:20:37] had to make the environment that would
[1:20:39] sustain the life of the fish, to sustain
[1:20:42] the life of the plants, to sustain the
[1:20:44] life of the trees.
[1:20:46] Is that right? It's the same way for you
[1:20:49] and I. Do you believe that? God knew
[1:20:51] there would be a message come. God knew
[1:20:54] I was going. He was going to send a
[1:20:55] prophet. He said, "I'm going to send
[1:20:57] one." Malachi 4, Luke 17:30, Revelation
[1:20:59] 10:7. I'm going to send him. But notice,
[1:21:02] he couldn't send him in any other age.
[1:21:05] Why? The environment had to be right for
[1:21:09] people to be on the earth that would
[1:21:11] believe that message that he said. Why?
[1:21:14] It would take that environment to
[1:21:16] sustain the life of the believer.
[1:21:20] Hallelujah.
[1:21:24] I don't know why preachers wear these
[1:21:25] things.
[1:21:28] It would take that message. I cannot
[1:21:31] sustain life off of Methodist and
[1:21:33] Baptist.
[1:21:33] Come on.
[1:21:34] I'm not putting nobody down if they're
[1:21:36] Methodist Baptist. God bless you.
[1:21:38] I'm just talking about the
[1:21:40] understanding.
[1:21:41] There'll be a lot of Methodists and
[1:21:43] Baptist and Presbyterians and Pentecost.
[1:21:44] Heaven will be full of all of that.
[1:21:48] I said heaven will be full of all of
[1:21:49] that.
[1:21:52] Your pastor believes that, so y'all
[1:21:53] should.
[1:21:55] But we're on a different scale and we're
[1:21:59] not better, but there's a predestination
[1:22:01] and a choosing and a selection and a
[1:22:04] though what God had collectively called
[1:22:06] us. And he said, "Now if Kim Bernett and
[1:22:08] Jason Watkins and there's going to be
[1:22:10] people on this earth, they're going to
[1:22:11] be in Buford, South Carolina. He's going
[1:22:13] to go down there and preach a message in
[1:22:14] 2025 of April the May the 18th. So I'm
[1:22:18] going to send a message that he will be
[1:22:20] able to preach there." Why? He has to be
[1:22:22] in that environment in order for them to
[1:22:25] be sustained what they believe to be
[1:22:29] sustained in the life that Jesus Christ
[1:22:31] has called me to be and called you to
[1:22:33] be. You understand? If the ground has
[1:22:36] nutrients, the water's there for the
[1:22:38] fish, the trees is ever there for the
[1:22:40] sun and the shade, then God did the same
[1:22:42] thing for humanity.
[1:22:46] So when you take these things out of
[1:22:48] that environment, Brother Jason,
[1:22:51] then they die.
[1:22:53] Take the fish out, it dies.
[1:22:58] Take the trees out,
[1:23:01] the sun burns up everything.
[1:23:04] God knew exactly how to place everything
[1:23:06] where it needed to be for the
[1:23:08] environment that it was going to be in.
[1:23:11] Oh my. God said, "I can't send Tim
[1:23:14] Bernardet to a denominational church."
[1:23:19] God says, "Ain't no way he can sit there
[1:23:20] and hear that."
[1:23:22] He says, "So, I got to have an
[1:23:24] environment for him.
[1:23:26] I've got to place something there on the
[1:23:27] earth that he needs. I know he's going
[1:23:30] to need it cuz I'm God. I I know
[1:23:32] everything." He says,
[1:23:34] "So, I got to place that there that
[1:23:36] he'll have something to sustain the life
[1:23:38] that I'm going to give him."
[1:23:40] Yes, sir.
[1:23:41] Hallelujah.
[1:23:43] There's going to be a message to come
[1:23:44] that'll sustain the body of Jesus
[1:23:47] Christ. It'll sustain the life that's
[1:23:49] inside of the bride of Jesus Christ.
[1:23:52] Hallelujah.
[1:23:54] If I came from God, then my sustainment
[1:23:56] is in God.
[1:23:58] Yes, sir.
[1:24:02] If my if if I come from God and we heard
[1:24:05] the saying, I come from God, I go back
[1:24:06] to God. Brother Brown tells us all the
[1:24:08] time, then there had to be something on
[1:24:11] here to sustain me. Amen.
[1:24:17] There had to be something of an
[1:24:19] environment that where I came from. Oh,
[1:24:22] hallelujah. I came from God. Then
[1:24:25] there's nothing that can satisfy me but
[1:24:28] God.
[1:24:31] There's nothing that can satisfy me but
[1:24:34] an environment of this message.
[1:24:38] That's the truth.
[1:24:39] Amen.
[1:24:42] I need that kind of environment to live.
[1:24:47] Oh God, help us to understand it.
[1:24:51] We come to the place where people don't
[1:24:53] want to participate. And I'm looking at
[1:24:55] bread, Bethlehem, and Judah, which is
[1:24:58] praise. Brother said, "You always notice
[1:25:00] Judah comes forth with praise."
[1:25:03] He said, "When it's the end, Judah
[1:25:04] brings it back up with praise." That's
[1:25:07] why you have a song service. What is it
[1:25:09] to do? to bring you into a
[1:25:11] participation.
[1:25:14] Can you imagine how these singers and
[1:25:16] these men and other women that would
[1:25:18] play this music, if you just sat on your
[1:25:20] hands,
[1:25:23] I bet you they ain't going to play here
[1:25:24] for long.
[1:25:29] If you don't participate,
[1:25:32] what are they doing? They're bringing an
[1:25:34] environment
[1:25:36] that you can worship. Yes.
[1:25:38] I don't know if I sung the song last
[1:25:40] night that Kenny Henson wrote. I've been
[1:25:42] to heaven, but I never left the room.
[1:25:46] Yes, sir.
[1:25:47] Did I sang that last night? I didn't. I
[1:25:49] sang it before I leave then.
[1:25:51] But the song tells us, I'm able
[1:25:54] Hallelujah. I'm able to leave this
[1:25:57] building, but yet still be in the
[1:25:59] building.
[1:26:01] I'm able to leave my pew but yet still
[1:26:04] be in the pew.
[1:26:06] Why? because it's able to go into
[1:26:09] another realm. Why? That environment
[1:26:12] draws me there.
[1:26:14] Matthew 6:9, Jesus tells them how to
[1:26:17] pray. I quoted it last night. He says,
[1:26:19] "Our Father, which are in heaven,
[1:26:20] hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come,
[1:26:22] thy will be done in earth." Notice where
[1:26:24] he wanted to be in earth. And because
[1:26:27] it's already there,
[1:26:28] so the environment in heaven, he says, I
[1:26:31] want that environment on the earth.
[1:26:33] Amen.
[1:26:36] You can't have two different
[1:26:37] environments.
[1:26:40] Amen.
[1:26:41] Don't work.
[1:26:42] You've got to have believers has to have
[1:26:45] the same environment.
[1:26:52] Can you say amen?
[1:26:55] And we there's so many folks come to the
[1:26:58] place, well, you know, I really don't
[1:27:01] fit in here.
[1:27:06] You know, nobody just they really don't
[1:27:08] like me.
[1:27:11] Quit thinking that nonsense.
[1:27:15] You know, they really don't miss me on
[1:27:16] Wednesday night.
[1:27:20] You know, I used to, you know, I used to
[1:27:23] get involved a little bit, but you know,
[1:27:25] it's different now.
[1:27:31] It's a little different. I I I I I I I
[1:27:33] you know I I just can't seem to get
[1:27:36] involved. Why?
[1:27:40] Jason ain't changed.
[1:27:42] He still preaches the same word.
[1:27:47] He still preaches the same environment.
[1:27:49] Amen.
[1:27:51] What's he doing? He's trying to pull the
[1:27:53] church up
[1:27:56] and elevate them to a place that they
[1:27:59] can oversee all the problems and
[1:28:02] troubles and trials that the enemy is
[1:28:04] trying to do to you.
[1:28:08] But when you're in it and you're looking
[1:28:10] at it, you got to get above it. That's
[1:28:12] why he says, "I've been I've been to
[1:28:14] heaven, but I never left the room."
[1:28:19] Amen.
[1:28:21] Paul tells us, "I was called up into the
[1:28:24] third heaven."
[1:28:27] Brother Brandham was caught up.
[1:28:29] Do you think they're the only ones that
[1:28:31] can be called up?
[1:28:34] You have the ability with the components
[1:28:36] that God give you and I a praise in the
[1:28:39] word or bread and the praise. Why both
[1:28:42] of those component is very vital to you
[1:28:45] serving the Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:28:48] Well, I'm just not going to clap no
[1:28:49] more. and I just don't feel like I'm
[1:28:50] going to praise him no more. I'm just
[1:28:52] not going to do Well, they didn't sing
[1:28:53] the right kind of song.
[1:29:00] Well, you know, I I I that's just not my
[1:29:03] style.
[1:29:05] We all have different styles.
[1:29:09] I can't sing like brother Lennial. His
[1:29:11] style is totally different.
[1:29:15] That's why when I sang a song of brother
[1:29:17] lineals, it's totally different way he
[1:29:18] wrote it. That's my style.
[1:29:22] I told these brothers yesterday and
[1:29:24] these sisters, I'm totally different. I
[1:29:26] play totally different. First of all, I
[1:29:28] can't play. I just get by.
[1:29:32] I said, but guys, gals, if you don't,
[1:29:34] you know, this this is just me. This is
[1:29:37] what you get. Amen.
[1:29:41] Now, I can't take the songs that our
[1:29:42] precious brother Wes and sing them and
[1:29:45] make it do what he does.
[1:29:48] I wish the Lord I could
[1:29:51] when he sits down and he opens that
[1:29:53] mouth,
[1:29:54] he knows how to bring that anointing.
[1:29:57] But his style is totally different.
[1:30:00] Well, they didn't sing the song that I
[1:30:02] like. You know, I just don't I didn't
[1:30:03] want to worship. Listen, friends, if
[1:30:06] you're here, there's a purpose. Amen.
[1:30:09] But if you'll get off of them pews and
[1:30:11] get in that environment, it don't matter
[1:30:14] what song these men and women sing. It
[1:30:17] don't matter what they play. Let them
[1:30:19] pull you up into that environment.
[1:30:25] Bless churches get all over me. Praise
[1:30:28] God.
[1:30:33] Well, you know, Brother Tim just this
[1:30:35] and brother Tim, I've had some of them
[1:30:37] to tell me, "Well, Brother Tim, when he
[1:30:38] gets up there and sings, he he just
[1:30:40] wants to entertain people."
[1:30:42] Well, I definitely sure don't want to
[1:30:44] bore you.
[1:30:48] So, if you want to call it entertaining,
[1:30:49] well, you go right ahead and call it
[1:30:51] what you want to call it. But I don't
[1:30:52] want you sitting there going to sleep on
[1:30:54] me. I don't want to bore you and say,
[1:30:57] "Brother Tim, he just bores me." You
[1:30:58] know, and some say, "Well, he bores me."
[1:31:00] Some says, "Well, had a few preachers
[1:31:01] that sent out sent out some things." We
[1:31:03] know that Tim Burden, he he he he he's
[1:31:06] just an entertainer.
[1:31:08] Well, thank you.
[1:31:16] My my my purpose is to be able to to be
[1:31:21] able to bring you up.
[1:31:23] That's right.
[1:31:25] Not that I'm higher, not that I'm
[1:31:27] greater, not that I'm smarter, because
[1:31:28] I'm sure you I'm dumber than all of
[1:31:30] y'all.
[1:31:33] But God has given something that would
[1:31:36] be able to bring you up
[1:31:38] in an environment to where you look and
[1:31:40] see, wow, I didn't know this was up
[1:31:43] here.
[1:31:45] Why? He created that for you.
[1:31:48] He created that so you could climb in
[1:31:51] that environment. Why? It's God's law.
[1:31:56] The law, the environment that we live
[1:31:58] in, we can survive.
[1:32:03] Get out of it and you die.
[1:32:07] Notice they lived in Bethlehem, Judea.
[1:32:10] They lived in bread. They lived in word.
[1:32:13] They lived in praise. But watch the
[1:32:15] scriptures. When they left, what
[1:32:16] happened? They died.
[1:32:19] Every time.
[1:32:20] Leave the word and you'll die
[1:32:22] spiritually.
[1:32:24] Yes, sir.
[1:32:25] Well, I just don't know if brother
[1:32:26] rounds a prophet or not. That's not up
[1:32:28] to me and you.
[1:32:31] I say when person leaves, go in peace.
[1:32:35] Just keep that mouth shut.
[1:32:36] Amen.
[1:32:37] Because if you don't understand it, let
[1:32:39] it go.
[1:32:41] What they don't realize, that's an
[1:32:43] environment that some people have to
[1:32:45] live in. God brought it to the earth in
[1:32:48] the seventh church age that you and I
[1:32:51] would have some bread, that we would
[1:32:53] have some praise. Oh, but brother Tim,
[1:32:55] we're in the messes now. We don't need
[1:32:57] praise. We don't need worship.
[1:33:02] You must be Baptist.
[1:33:09] It's a part of the environment that God
[1:33:12] calls us into. Well, brother Tim, I
[1:33:14] don't I I I don't I don't scream like
[1:33:16] you. I don't holler like you. I don't
[1:33:18] jump like you. I don't shout like you.
[1:33:20] God don't want you to do what I do.
[1:33:23] That's right.
[1:33:25] God don't want you to do that.
[1:33:27] God wants you to be what he made you.
[1:33:30] But I assure you, he made the same
[1:33:32] environment that would bring each one of
[1:33:34] us up into the place.
[1:33:37] The same message can speak to every
[1:33:40] heart. Wow.
[1:33:42] If there's 100 to 125 here this morning,
[1:33:45] I don't know, but the same message can
[1:33:47] speak to every individual as it's
[1:33:50] preached.
[1:33:51] That's the kind of God we serve. That's
[1:33:53] the kind of bread. Hallelujah. That's
[1:33:55] the kind of bread we got. That's the
[1:33:57] kind of praise we got.
[1:33:59] It's not a fake praise. It's something
[1:34:01] that God give us. Brother Ram said, "I
[1:34:03] found myself going around and around and
[1:34:05] around and around that oak tree when I
[1:34:07] looked at that eagle there." He said it
[1:34:09] took one big old leap and jumped off and
[1:34:12] got a breeze upon it and it sailed clean
[1:34:15] out of sight.
[1:34:19] Can you imagine your prophet going
[1:34:21] around and around that oak tree?
[1:34:25] I can.
[1:34:28] If I'd have been there, I'd have been
[1:34:29] running right behind him.
[1:34:32] When they left Judah, they begin to die
[1:34:36] off.
[1:34:41] The the environment that we must live in
[1:34:46] is the word for the day.
[1:34:49] Yeah.
[1:34:50] Not a word that's back yonder. Not a
[1:34:52] message is back yonder.
[1:34:57] We didn't come to look at each other's
[1:34:59] standards.
[1:35:01] I'm not worried about your standard. I'm
[1:35:03] not worried about what you wore today. I
[1:35:06] don't care what you wore today.
[1:35:08] If you wore flip flops, I don't care.
[1:35:11] You wouldn't never catch me in a pair of
[1:35:13] flip flops, but if you wore them, then
[1:35:14] God bless your heart.
[1:35:18] We don't come for that purpose.
[1:35:21] We don't come to see somebody else's
[1:35:23] standards. And that's the problem today.
[1:35:25] We're so busy looking it around at so
[1:35:27] and so and brother this and sister this.
[1:35:30] I I didn't come to see how well you was
[1:35:32] dressed. Well, you know, they dress
[1:35:33] here. It doesn't matter to me. I come to
[1:35:36] worship. I come to get bread. I come to
[1:35:39] praise.
[1:35:40] Yes sir.
[1:35:45] Your environment is everything.
[1:35:49] And in that environment, you need it.
[1:35:55] You take a person. How many's ever heard
[1:35:57] of my pillow?
[1:36:00] I got one. They sleep pretty good.
[1:36:03] Here's
[1:36:06] a plug for old Mike Lindell.
[1:36:10] Mike Lindell has a big company out in uh
[1:36:12] uh Minh
[1:36:15] Minneapolis somewhere out that way. And
[1:36:18] and all he hires
[1:36:21] is drug dealers. I mean drug people that
[1:36:23] use drugs. That's who he hires cuz he
[1:36:27] was a he was a a druggie himself. Was on
[1:36:30] the streets most of his life. He was he
[1:36:33] was terrible.
[1:36:36] I have friends that work with me. I I I
[1:36:39] the some of the guys that work with me,
[1:36:40] I've been with friends with them 35, 40,
[1:36:42] 45 years. I mean, I've watched them be
[1:36:44] get on drugs and it take them from
[1:36:46] working with me and next week they're in
[1:36:48] in jail for 15 years.
[1:36:52] I don't have a job where I sit in the
[1:36:54] office by myself. I have a job around
[1:36:56] the world.
[1:36:58] My environment every day is around the
[1:37:00] world.
[1:37:02] Everybody I work with is drug addicts
[1:37:04] mostly. If not, they're drinkers.
[1:37:09] But that's the environment that I'm in
[1:37:11] constantly.
[1:37:14] And I watch these people. I watch this
[1:37:18] good friend of mine. He went into prison
[1:37:20] for 15 years. When he got out, I went
[1:37:23] down to Aken, South Carolina and got
[1:37:25] him. when he walked out,
[1:37:29] pulled him right back on my crew like he
[1:37:31] never left.
[1:37:35] I said I said, "You going to make it
[1:37:38] this time?" He said, "The only way for
[1:37:41] me to survive,
[1:37:43] I have to change my environment."
[1:37:50] So, he comes back. He finds him a house.
[1:37:52] He's got a wife, got a couple of kids,
[1:37:55] grandkids. He finds a place that is
[1:37:58] secluded from his old neighborhood.
[1:38:02] I said, "Do you ever see any of these?"
[1:38:04] And I call, he said, "Well, I see them
[1:38:05] walking down the street." He said, "But
[1:38:07] Timothy, I can't stop and talk to him
[1:38:09] and fellowship with them." He said, "If
[1:38:11] I don't change my environment, I'll find
[1:38:13] myself back in that."
[1:38:19] So, Mike Lindell was a druggie. Bad.
[1:38:22] bad, bad. Opened a company, started
[1:38:24] making pillows, making my coffee now,
[1:38:26] making uh h my my pillowcases and
[1:38:30] everything you can make. My pillow makes
[1:38:32] it. And the people that work for him is
[1:38:34] druggies.
[1:38:36] He pulls them off the street, sent them
[1:38:38] through their class thing, and he hired
[1:38:40] them. He has helped hundreds and
[1:38:41] hundreds. Why? He pulled them from an
[1:38:44] environment that they that they lived
[1:38:46] off of and placed them in another
[1:38:48] environment. Yeah.
[1:38:50] And every one of those people that work
[1:38:52] for him claim Jesus Christ. Now
[1:38:57] they don't know what we know far as
[1:38:59] understanding with the message, but they
[1:39:01] do know of an environment.
[1:39:03] They knew they had to change something
[1:39:06] or they'd find themselves in the same
[1:39:08] place.
[1:39:13] I know people personally that I I that I
[1:39:15] try I've talked to and tried to get off.
[1:39:18] They don't. There's many people don't
[1:39:20] want off of drugs.
[1:39:22] They don't want to change the
[1:39:24] environment. They they they they thrive
[1:39:26] for that environment.
[1:39:29] But there's people that wants off of it.
[1:39:31] If you can give them a little nudge and
[1:39:33] a little help.
[1:39:35] It'll pull them off of the streets and
[1:39:37] put them right in a AA meeting. And
[1:39:39] that's what they believe in.
[1:39:43] I'm not against that.
[1:39:45] It's there to help people.
[1:39:52] So the environment that people are in,
[1:39:56] if you want to change, you've got to
[1:39:58] pull away from that.
[1:40:00] If there's an envir if if I was in a
[1:40:03] church that was dead,
[1:40:05] that didn't like music, didn't like
[1:40:07] singing,
[1:40:08] I wouldn't last five seconds. Amen.
[1:40:13] Amen.
[1:40:15] They might have the greatest preacher
[1:40:16] there is. I wouldn't last five seconds.
[1:40:19] Why? Because that environment, Brother
[1:40:21] West, is a part of my life.
[1:40:24] Amen. That's right.
[1:40:26] Amen.
[1:40:28] That part of the environment is a part
[1:40:30] of who I am.
[1:40:32] God created me that way. So, it takes
[1:40:35] that that environment for me to live off
[1:40:38] of, for me to to to sustain what's
[1:40:41] inside of me.
[1:40:43] I don't want a dead church. I ain't
[1:40:44] going to a dead church.
[1:40:53] You understand?
[1:40:55] If you don't take that guy away from the
[1:40:57] environment, he'll be back on drugs next
[1:40:59] week.
[1:41:00] That's right.
[1:41:02] You have to change the people that
[1:41:05] you're around.
[1:41:09] You understand?
[1:41:10] Now, I'm not going to get nowhere near
[1:41:11] through with this, but I'm going to try
[1:41:12] to jump.
[1:41:15] So, the environment must change for that
[1:41:18] person to survive. And it's the same way
[1:41:21] in the spiritual side. Once you begin to
[1:41:24] to be able to follow Jesus, the people
[1:41:27] that is around you will not understand.
[1:41:31] You don't take that person and throw
[1:41:33] them away because you we may think we're
[1:41:34] a little higher because we are
[1:41:36] Christians now and I don't talk like if
[1:41:38] I went by the way people talked around
[1:41:40] me. I never go to work because they say
[1:41:43] words I've never heard.
[1:41:47] Now there's a lot of people in the
[1:41:49] message, a lot of people may be in here
[1:41:50] that don't have to be around that.
[1:41:53] You don't you have no idea.
[1:41:58] There's two kind of rough rough people
[1:41:59] and they're painters and roofers.
[1:42:03] I don't know if there's no painters in
[1:42:04] here or not. Doesn't matter to me. I
[1:42:06] know a lot of painters.
[1:42:10] Plumbers, too, then.
[1:42:14] But if you had to work around me with
[1:42:17] one day, I don't know how many messes
[1:42:19] people would last, Brother Jason.
[1:42:22] Cuz I hear words I didn't even know were
[1:42:25] there. Amen.
[1:42:27] And most of these people has respect for
[1:42:30] me because they know who I am. But some
[1:42:32] of them just could care less.
[1:42:38] Sometimes it aggravates me and I'll tell
[1:42:40] them to go get an English book.
[1:42:42] I told one, I said, "Do you know
[1:42:44] English?" He said, "What do you mean?" I
[1:42:45] said, "I'll have you one tomorrow."
[1:42:48] So the next morning I brought a book in.
[1:42:50] He said, "What's this?" I said, "This is
[1:42:51] for you to learn a new language while
[1:42:52] you work around me."
[1:42:54] Well, he got the picture and he changed
[1:42:56] him to somewhat.
[1:42:58] But see, if I had to work if I if I
[1:43:01] couldn't work around that, I I a lot of
[1:43:04] people would let that pull them over.
[1:43:07] Cuz remember, whether you realize it or
[1:43:09] not, most of you don't know me. He does,
[1:43:11] but he he don't not living with me. He
[1:43:13] don't know me like who I know me.
[1:43:17] Cuz there was a time when I was out in
[1:43:19] the world.
[1:43:20] Now, I know you people thought I was
[1:43:21] perfect.
[1:43:27] I was raised by a message preacher.
[1:43:30] This message preacher was harder than
[1:43:32] that. They
[1:43:34] ain't none of you young girls could live
[1:43:36] with my daddy. He would done strung you
[1:43:38] up and hung you.
[1:43:45] I couldn't go nowhere, do anything cuz
[1:43:47] it beat me back home.
[1:43:51] Where'd you go tonight? and I would him
[1:43:53] haul and go way out through here. He
[1:43:54] says, "Won't you understand me because I
[1:43:55] know where you was at." He had eyes
[1:43:58] everywhere.
[1:44:01] You wouldn't know it. One day, and I'm
[1:44:02] not proud to say this, but I was one of
[1:44:04] those cussers.
[1:44:08] The more I said, the better I liked it.
[1:44:13] That's hard to see that in me, ain't it?
[1:44:16] I come home one day one day and daddy
[1:44:18] said, "Damn, how can you talk like that
[1:44:21] out there, but when you come in this
[1:44:22] yard, you forget everything you say and
[1:44:24] you you talk totally different?" I said,
[1:44:26] "I don't know how to do that.
[1:44:28] I don't know."
[1:44:30] Really, I do know cuz he'd backhand me.
[1:44:40] But one day, my environment changed.
[1:44:46] I didn't have no desire to say a cuss
[1:44:48] word.
[1:44:51] Now, that that's about all I ever done.
[1:44:53] That was really wrong. If you look at
[1:44:55] the world standards, I didn't drink. I
[1:44:57] didn't smoke. I didn't care nothing
[1:44:59] about none of that. I didn't care
[1:45:00] nothing about running around doing
[1:45:02] everything in the world. All I wanted to
[1:45:04] do was cuss and chew the backer.
[1:45:08] That's all that's all I've really ever
[1:45:09] done that was wrong to my standards now.
[1:45:12] Yeah.
[1:45:13] But one day when God changed my
[1:45:15] environment,
[1:45:18] I've never set another one.
[1:45:23] The last time I chewed, I spit out I
[1:45:26] don't know what changed in my taste
[1:45:27] buds.
[1:45:28] Wow.
[1:45:29] But I tell you, I love tobacco.
[1:45:33] I could chew 24 hours a day.
[1:45:37] Daddy said, "How do you do it?" I said,
[1:45:38] "I swallow it."
[1:45:42] He said, "I don't believe you." Cuz he
[1:45:43] caught me one day with it. He said, "Put
[1:45:45] it in there and swallow it." He thought
[1:45:46] he was going to make me sick. I put a
[1:45:48] big old plug of RJ Gold boy and chomp
[1:45:51] down on it and swallowed it. He said,
[1:45:53] "You are a nut."
[1:45:57] But what he didn't understand, that was
[1:46:00] my environment.
[1:46:02] even though he taught me against it.
[1:46:07] But brother Wes, one day I come home and
[1:46:09] spit it out and never put a nothing in
[1:46:11] there.
[1:46:12] One day I said my last cuss word. Why?
[1:46:14] My environment changed.
[1:46:17] I've never had a desire to go back to
[1:46:19] that environment.
[1:46:22] Thank you, Lord. Amen.
[1:46:29] I accidentally said one round mama one
[1:46:31] time.
[1:46:45] She said, "What did you say?" I said,
[1:46:46] "Nothing."
[1:46:49] She said, "I knew what you said." She
[1:46:51] said, "I just want to see if you tell
[1:46:52] me." I said, "What you going to do?" She
[1:46:54] said, "Oh, I'm waiting. Emanuel comes
[1:46:56] home." I said, "Well, you can go ahead
[1:46:58] and whoop me now if you want to." She
[1:47:00] said, "Nah, I want your daddy to get a
[1:47:02] hold of this one."
[1:47:07] And buddy, he did. He did.
[1:47:12] But see, once the environment changes,
[1:47:16] I I don't know how it works. I can't,
[1:47:19] brother said, I can't explain how all of
[1:47:21] it works.
[1:47:22] He said, I just know when something
[1:47:24] changes.
[1:47:26] Glory to God.
[1:47:29] I ain't never wanted another child.
[1:47:34] And after I got saved, I was still
[1:47:36] young. This is when before I ever
[1:47:37] started preaching, and I was serving
[1:47:38] God, you know, to the best of my
[1:47:39] ability. I go down to Sandy Cooper with
[1:47:41] a bunch of guys and we fishing. The guys
[1:47:43] on the boat was was chewing the beggar.
[1:47:44] He said, "Tim, you used to chew." I
[1:47:46] said, "Yeah, I don't care about it no
[1:47:47] more." And I didn't want them to know
[1:47:49] that I was trying to serve God. And they
[1:47:51] looked at me and they I thought of
[1:47:52] Brother, you know, and they said, "Well,
[1:47:53] Tim, I'll just go ahead and put one in
[1:47:55] your mouth." Said, "You'll like it
[1:47:56] again." And I said, and they kept on. I
[1:47:58] said, "Give me that thing." So, he
[1:48:00] throwed it over to me and I got a big
[1:48:02] old chaw red man. I stuck it in my
[1:48:04] mouth. Made me sick as a dog.
[1:48:08] Amen. I spit over the boat and started
[1:48:10] puking and spitting over the boat. He
[1:48:12] said, "I thought you liked it." I said,
[1:48:13] "Something's changed."
[1:48:15] When God changes you, you don't go back.
[1:48:20] You may fall. You may You're not
[1:48:22] perfect. You may have mistakes. You may
[1:48:23] fall, but keep getting up.
[1:48:30] Try your best to stay in the environment
[1:48:33] where God brought you to a new
[1:48:35] environment to sustain you. Amen.
[1:48:39] Amen.
[1:48:43] Hallelujah.
[1:48:44] When your environment changes,
[1:48:47] there's many times things will try to
[1:48:49] pull you back out of that environment.
[1:48:52] Scriptures teaches that it'll pull you
[1:48:54] back out of that environment. If we
[1:48:57] watch the book of Acts there and the
[1:48:58] environment, if you go to I think I've
[1:49:00] got it here somewhere. If you go to the
[1:49:02] book of Acts, you don't have to turn
[1:49:03] there. I'll just I'll just read it
[1:49:05] myself. But it's so striking and I love
[1:49:07] it.
[1:49:11] Do you love him?
[1:49:15] I got a couple of quotes I want to read
[1:49:17] to you in just a moment. Notice Brother
[1:49:19] Bam said, "In the Garden of Eden, sin
[1:49:20] was so beautiful until attracted Eve
[1:49:22] from righteousness to sin. In the same
[1:49:25] garden where there was a tree of life,
[1:49:27] there was a tree of death."
[1:49:30] The same environment there was both
[1:49:32] trees. So just because you come to serve
[1:49:34] God, just because you come to be in an
[1:49:37] environment, it doesn't mean it's not
[1:49:39] going to try to pull you out of that
[1:49:40] environment.
[1:49:42] Satan, the enemy is going to try to pull
[1:49:44] you out of that environment and
[1:49:46] constantly let you be around this and
[1:49:48] that and that and everything else.
[1:49:52] Watch, brother. He said, "Now we know it
[1:49:54] today as a law that there where's good,
[1:49:58] there's evil. Where there's right,
[1:50:00] there's wrong." He says we will never no
[1:50:03] matter how our environment may be able
[1:50:05] to shake ourselves from the presence of
[1:50:07] either.
[1:50:09] So both environments is there
[1:50:13] when you come to church both
[1:50:15] environments are there.
[1:50:18] But said that's where the devil likes to
[1:50:20] go is to church.
[1:50:22] He likes to go to church more than
[1:50:24] people like to go to church.
[1:50:27] So you can't you just don't come to
[1:50:29] church and get out of that environment.
[1:50:30] That environment's here with you whether
[1:50:32] you like it or not. That's where you got
[1:50:34] to get off the pews and climb into the
[1:50:36] presence of God.
[1:50:40] He says, notice, he said, where there's
[1:50:42] right, there's wrong. You cannot ever,
[1:50:45] no matter what environment you be in,
[1:50:47] ever shake yourselves from the presence
[1:50:49] of either. Paul says, "When I would do
[1:50:52] good, evil's present." The sinner will
[1:50:54] never be able to shake itself away from
[1:50:55] the Christian. The Christian will never
[1:50:57] be able to shake himself away from the
[1:50:59] sinner.
[1:51:03] Oh my. There will be a witness there of
[1:51:05] right and a testimony of wrong always.
[1:51:08] And you have to make your choice which
[1:51:11] side you're on.
[1:51:15] I'm skipping a lot to get something.
[1:51:18] Notice Acts 16. Who's having received
[1:51:20] such a charge thrust them into the inner
[1:51:23] prisons Paul and Silas and made their
[1:51:26] feet fast in the stalks. Inner means the
[1:51:29] inner cell and then if you run it on the
[1:51:31] spiritual side it means the inner soul.
[1:51:35] So it's a two-fold meaning. He says the
[1:51:38] inner prison. The Bible says so at
[1:51:41] throws them into a inner cell are their
[1:51:44] soul. And at midnight Paul and Silas
[1:51:47] prayed and sang praises unto God and the
[1:51:49] prisoners heard them.
[1:51:52] And suddenly there was a great
[1:51:53] earthquake so that the foundations of
[1:51:55] the prisons were shaken. And immediately
[1:51:57] all the doors were opened and everyone's
[1:52:00] bands were loosed.
[1:52:02] Why? Because they changed the
[1:52:04] environment.
[1:52:06] Do you realize? Go back and do a study
[1:52:08] on the prison that Paul was thw
[1:52:14] dead where dead men was laying. Rats
[1:52:16] infested. Human waste never was clean.
[1:52:19] And they was put in the inner sail of
[1:52:21] that.
[1:52:23] They could have said, "Oh, I don't know
[1:52:24] what I'm going to do. I'm in this place
[1:52:26] and I can't get out. They could have had
[1:52:28] They rightfully had every excuse.
[1:52:33] Woo! Hallelujah.
[1:52:36] They had every excuse
[1:52:39] to be frustrated. They had every excuse
[1:52:43] to actually say, "I I I'm done. I can't
[1:52:46] do it no more."
[1:52:50] I didn't do nothing to get in this
[1:52:51] prison.
[1:52:53] All I was doing was doing the right
[1:52:54] things.
[1:52:56] Amen.
[1:53:03] Let me show you something. I'll come
[1:53:05] back to that because I'm going to inject
[1:53:06] in something here and come back to it in
[1:53:08] close. If you watch the scriptures or
[1:53:10] you find that Jesus had 12 disciples,
[1:53:12] keep acts on your mind. One hung
[1:53:14] himself. They picked another disciple
[1:53:16] and made it 12 again. Right? 12 was a
[1:53:19] very important number to God.
[1:53:22] It has a couple of different meanings.
[1:53:23] One of them is completeness. One of them
[1:53:25] is authority.
[1:53:27] So the book of acts, they come from 12
[1:53:29] disciples to 12 apostles.
[1:53:33] Now the the the environment had changed
[1:53:36] somewhat. Four gospels was preaching.
[1:53:39] Jesus was preaching and it was the acts
[1:53:41] of Jesus. Now they move into the the the
[1:53:45] book of acts. Now it's the acts of the
[1:53:47] apostles. The same men.
[1:53:50] Amen.
[1:53:52] same people,
[1:53:54] but now their environment was different.
[1:53:57] Jesus wasn't with them,
[1:54:00] but he had instilled something in them.
[1:54:09] Oh my. They now notice this, they become
[1:54:12] the twel apostles. Now their duty,
[1:54:15] notice this, their duty wasn't just
[1:54:17] brother Jason to be a pupil.
[1:54:20] Amen.
[1:54:23] Now they are to go do what Jesus did.
[1:54:33] Oh my. I still believe in a body
[1:54:35] movement.
[1:54:38] I still believe there's a movement for
[1:54:39] the body to be in.
[1:54:42] Notice here in the book of Acts, the
[1:54:44] energy was changed. Notice as the energy
[1:54:47] changes now, it changes the environment
[1:54:50] with it.
[1:54:51] Amen.
[1:54:54] As the Holy Ghost came upon these 12
[1:54:57] men, they began to preach the power of
[1:54:59] God under an environment.
[1:55:02] Amen. that was so under demonstration
[1:55:09] as they went preaching here and there
[1:55:11] and preaching and bringing the gospel
[1:55:13] about. They notice what these men did.
[1:55:16] They didn't have television host. They
[1:55:18] didn't have internet host. They didn't
[1:55:20] have iPads. They didn't have Bibles like
[1:55:23] we have today. They didn't have radio.
[1:55:26] They didn't have Facebook.
[1:55:32] When me and this guy and these other men
[1:55:33] preach, they preach around the world on
[1:55:35] Facebook. If somebody wants it, there it
[1:55:37] is.
[1:55:38] But these 12 men did something that we
[1:55:42] can't do today.
[1:55:45] And we got everything at our disposal.
[1:55:51] You know what the difference was? Their
[1:55:53] environment.
[1:55:55] They preached under the power of the
[1:55:56] Holy Ghost. Amen.
[1:55:59] They didn't worry about it if it was on
[1:56:01] cuz cuz I I get so frustrated with
[1:56:03] Facebook and YouTube and all that. I
[1:56:04] tell my church, I'm taking it off. I'm
[1:56:06] sick of all of it.
[1:56:09] But then I get to thinking, well, maybe
[1:56:10] one person might hear something that'll
[1:56:12] help them.
[1:56:14] So, I try to weigh that thing out. But I
[1:56:16] begin to think about these 12 men here.
[1:56:18] They did something with 12 people that
[1:56:21] is so hard for me and these men to do.
[1:56:24] and we've got everything at our
[1:56:26] disposal.
[1:56:29] Now, I know it's a different age,
[1:56:31] so I take in consideration of all of
[1:56:33] that. They packed out churches.
[1:56:39] Thousands upon thousands upon I mean men
[1:56:41] and women packed out churches and didn't
[1:56:43] have no way to advertise it.
[1:56:45] Amen. But their life
[1:56:48] cuz they had been in an environment.
[1:56:51] They had been in an environment that was
[1:56:53] so powerful. They burned with the fire
[1:56:56] of God.
[1:56:59] It was so powerful. It actually changed
[1:57:02] the acts of the Holy Spirit in such a
[1:57:04] way that it now come upon these men. And
[1:57:08] these men were so close under the
[1:57:10] environment of God.
[1:57:14] Watch these guys.
[1:57:17] And the keeper,
[1:57:20] notice, all the doors were open and the
[1:57:23] bands were loose. And the keeper of the
[1:57:24] prison awakened out of his sleep, seeing
[1:57:26] the prison doors open, drew his sword
[1:57:28] and was going to kill himself, supposing
[1:57:29] the prisoners hasn't fled because he
[1:57:31] knew that they would kill him. And Paul
[1:57:34] cried with a loud voice, saying, "Do not
[1:57:36] harm thyself. We're all here."
[1:57:37] Yeah.
[1:57:41] Then he called for a light, sprang in
[1:57:43] and came trembling and fell down before
[1:57:45] Paul and Silas and brought them out and
[1:57:48] said, "Sir," notice the first thing,
[1:57:50] "Sir, what must we do
[1:57:52] to have what you got?"
[1:57:56] They brought an environment into the
[1:57:57] prison that they was changing the prison
[1:57:59] guards.
[1:58:05] This man got up that morning to go do
[1:58:07] his duty as a soldier. did have no idea
[1:58:09] what was going to take place. Notice
[1:58:12] what they said. Believe on the Lord
[1:58:13] Jesus Christ, thou shalt be saved and
[1:58:15] thy house.
[1:58:16] And they spake unto him the word of the
[1:58:18] Lord to all that were in the house. And
[1:58:19] he took them the same hour of the night,
[1:58:21] washed their stripes, and was baptized
[1:58:22] he and all his straight way.
[1:58:26] Oh my God.
[1:58:29] And when he had brought them into his
[1:58:30] house, he set me before them and
[1:58:32] rejoiced, believing with God with all
[1:58:34] his house.
[1:58:37] I want you to get before I leave and go
[1:58:39] today and when I go back to upper South
[1:58:42] Carolina,
[1:58:44] I want I want you to get this in your
[1:58:46] spirit so strong that you don't forget
[1:58:50] about what was preached or said today or
[1:58:52] sung this weekend. I want you to take it
[1:58:54] home with you. I want you to understand
[1:58:56] if I can climb in that environment as
[1:58:58] that preacher said, I'm going tell you
[1:59:00] friends, it'll change your life.
[1:59:03] Young people, it'll change your life.
[1:59:05] Amen.
[1:59:13] Paul and Silas noticed all they were
[1:59:15] doing was going back doing good. They
[1:59:16] wasn't doing nothing bad.
[1:59:18] If you read the scriptures, you'll find
[1:59:19] that there was a woman called Lydia. She
[1:59:22] was a seller of purple.
[1:59:25] She was in the city of Tharia.
[1:59:29] Notice and she worshiped God. The Lord
[1:59:32] had opened her heart. Watch this.
[1:59:38] She was baptized and she constrained
[1:59:40] them to abide at her place according to
[1:59:42] the Bible. I'm just paraphrasing.
[1:59:45] And there was another woman there
[1:59:46] possessed of a spirit
[1:59:49] and Paul him says this old soothsayer
[1:59:53] and the people got a hold of it. This is
[1:59:55] why Paul when he come against that they
[1:59:57] throw Paul and Silas in prison.
[2:00:00] But God had already done orchestrated
[2:00:02] this to take place because he knew what
[2:00:04] he was going to do in prison. I wish we
[2:00:06] could do in church what they done in
[2:00:08] prison.
[2:00:11] I want to come to church and do what
[2:00:13] they did in prison and make it happen in
[2:00:16] church.
[2:00:19] Woo. Hallelujah.
[2:00:21] I don't want to come church and stay
[2:00:23] cold, formal, starchy.
[2:00:25] I don't want to come to church and stay
[2:00:26] that way. I want to if I'm different, I
[2:00:28] want to leave different.
[2:00:32] Yes, sir.
[2:00:33] I want to see what they done in prison.
[2:00:35] Notice they're in prison. The stink of
[2:00:38] everything is on them. They're bound,
[2:00:40] their hands, their feet. They can't do
[2:00:42] nothing. But somehow, Brother Jason,
[2:00:44] they begin to get up and clap their
[2:00:46] hands. I can imagine the chains moving.
[2:00:49] I can imagine all the people was
[2:00:51] listening at them and they said, "Oh,
[2:00:52] they're crazy. They're just some of
[2:00:54] those old Christian folk." But about
[2:00:56] that time Jesus came down.
[2:00:59] The same one that Paul was fixing to
[2:01:01] meet. He that man came down
[2:01:05] and changed the environment of the
[2:01:07] prison
[2:01:08] and men in the prison got saved and
[2:01:12] believed.
[2:01:16] Thank you, Lord.
[2:01:20] Hallelujah.
[2:01:26] Notice,
[2:01:29] see the men was using this soothsayer to
[2:01:33] make money off of her.
[2:01:36] And they got mad at Paul and Silas cuz
[2:01:38] now they getting in their back pockets.
[2:01:41] Oh, you get a person's you get in a
[2:01:43] person's bill, it's going to change.
[2:01:46] So now Paul and Silas and got in there
[2:01:48] the master's bill and they said, "Oh, we
[2:01:50] ain't having his man. We got to get them
[2:01:51] guys gone.
[2:01:54] We got to get them. So they went down to
[2:01:55] the masters and they said, "These guys
[2:01:56] are doing this. They've come against
[2:01:57] this. They're doing this. They're doing
[2:01:58] that." And they take and put them in
[2:02:00] prison and God's orchestrated the whole
[2:02:02] thing.
[2:02:02] That's right.
[2:02:05] Why? God had some believers down there
[2:02:07] in prison.
[2:02:08] Yeah.
[2:02:10] He says, "I'm going to put Paul on." And
[2:02:11] they're sitting there and the Napodium
[2:02:14] had every right
[2:02:17] to say, "You wise me.
[2:02:21] I don't have that right. I live a pretty
[2:02:24] good life. Y'all live a pretty good
[2:02:27] life.
[2:02:28] I don't see no bums in here.
[2:02:31] Everybody looks like they eating
[2:02:32] healthy.
[2:02:34] I'm not saying you're big and fat. I'm
[2:02:36] saying you look like I don't see
[2:02:37] nobody's skin and bones.
[2:02:40] But they had every right to be
[2:02:41] frustrated.
[2:02:42] They had every right to sit there and
[2:02:44] say, "Nobody loves me.
[2:02:47] I just don't know if I can keep on
[2:02:48] following this Jesus or not. You know, I
[2:02:51] never went to prison when I when I
[2:02:52] wasn't following him.
[2:02:56] They had every every opportunity to to
[2:03:00] make it worseer and worseer. They could
[2:03:02] have got mad. They could have did all
[2:03:04] this thing.
[2:03:06] They beat Paul. They beat them. They
[2:03:08] rent their clothes off of them. The
[2:03:10] Bible says they laid stripes on them and
[2:03:12] throwed them in a prison.
[2:03:23] You understand, friends?
[2:03:26] But something happened
[2:03:28] and there's so much in this I can't
[2:03:29] never get to it. There's no way.
[2:03:33] But something happened and I could go
[2:03:35] from story to story to story to story in
[2:03:37] the Bible.
[2:03:39] And if I could jump, when Paul and Silas
[2:03:42] begin to pray,
[2:03:44] they were so in tune with God
[2:03:48] that they they're literally in a prison
[2:03:51] with the stink of a human waste, rats,
[2:03:54] it's infested. Go pull up how this
[2:03:56] prison was. It was the worst of the
[2:03:58] worst. Dead people's laying everywhere
[2:04:00] and pawn him sitting there. And somehow
[2:04:03] they begin to sing and clap. How could
[2:04:07] these men do this? Amen.
[2:04:11] They could said, "We don't deserve
[2:04:12] this." And they didn't.
[2:04:15] All they was doing, Brother West, was
[2:04:16] doing good.
[2:04:18] But God had allowed them to be put in
[2:04:20] that in that place to change the
[2:04:24] atmosphere.
[2:04:26] And then Paul started clapping his
[2:04:27] hands.
[2:04:30] Silas probably looked at him and said,
[2:04:31] "Paul, are you gone a little nuts? Do
[2:04:34] you realize, Paul, where we're at?" Paul
[2:04:37] said, 'Yeah.' He said, 'But I know if we
[2:04:40] said here, we'll die in this mess.
[2:04:45] But Silas, think about it. If we can
[2:04:46] just change the atmosphere a little bit.
[2:04:48] Let's change the environment. Silus
[2:04:50] says, "Why would we do that?" He
[2:04:51] probably started singing, started
[2:04:53] clapping his hands, started stomping his
[2:04:56] feet. Change was rattling. He probably
[2:04:58] started saying, "I'm one of them."
[2:05:00] That's right.
[2:05:01] I'm one of them. I remember my dad
[2:05:04] saying something, brother Jason, 40
[2:05:06] years ago, and he was preaching on
[2:05:07] something along these lines here. He
[2:05:09] said, "God got so happy, he couldn't
[2:05:10] stand it." And said, "God just took that
[2:05:12] big old foot and hit one time and the
[2:05:14] whole jail opened up."
[2:05:19] And they stayed there.
[2:05:21] They stayed there.
[2:05:24] They now begin to go in their bread.
[2:05:27] They had the word. Now they was having
[2:05:29] to praise. Now they was beginning to
[2:05:31] interlock it together.
[2:05:34] Naomi was going back to Bethlehem. There
[2:05:37] was going back to the house of bread.
[2:05:39] They were going back to Judah of praise.
[2:05:43] Praise is a very important thing. It's
[2:05:45] two vital components that you need in
[2:05:48] your life.
[2:05:50] I'm not talking about this this garbage
[2:05:52] and junk we see all over the world. I'm
[2:05:54] talking about worship and praise from
[2:05:55] the hearts of men and women that's
[2:05:57] filled with the Holy Ghost. I'm talking
[2:05:59] about praise and worship like you see
[2:06:00] these guys play music and these gals
[2:06:02] play and they sing songs. I'm talking
[2:06:05] about that kind of praise. God inhabits
[2:06:07] that.
[2:06:10] He live, notice where he lives, brother
[2:06:12] Jason. He lives in that praise.
[2:06:17] He loves to be worshiped.
[2:06:22] He loves to be praised.
[2:06:27] I like this. What brother Bam said,
[2:06:32] brother Bam said in any time that a
[2:06:33] believer gets off his God-given grounds.
[2:06:38] He said many times they jump in
[2:06:39] politics. He said this election coming
[2:06:42] forth, a good man can be a good man.
[2:06:44] He'll wander off the grounds like a
[2:06:46] certain minister and he goes on a few
[2:06:48] things and a mayor of the city. Then he
[2:06:50] says, "If a Christian gets off of those
[2:06:53] God-given grounds,"
[2:06:56] he said, "you'll find yourselves in the
[2:06:59] poo room again."
[2:07:02] In other words, if you change your
[2:07:04] environment,
[2:07:05] you'll find yourself going back doing
[2:07:07] the things of the world.
[2:07:10] He says, he says, "Oh," he says, "Oh,
[2:07:13] it's not going to hurt for me to it'll
[2:07:15] do no harm if I get off of these
[2:07:17] grounds." Brother, I'm portraying this
[2:07:19] now as environment. If you go read this,
[2:07:22] he said, "Oh, it's not going to hurt for
[2:07:24] me to do that. It's
[2:07:26] I'll do no harm. I'll just take one
[2:07:29] little drink."
[2:07:31] He said, "You're off your grounds. Come
[2:07:33] back."
[2:07:35] He said, "You're setting your course for
[2:07:37] trouble."
[2:07:40] He said, "All the rest of the little
[2:07:42] girls are smoking a cigarette." He said,
[2:07:43] "Oh, you say, well, I'll just try one."
[2:07:45] He said, "You're off your grounds. Don't
[2:07:47] do that. Stay in your homeland.
[2:07:53] You say, "Well, everybody's over here
[2:07:54] and they call me an old fogy. They call
[2:07:56] me oldfashioned. They call me." He said,
[2:07:58] "That's where God called you."
[2:08:02] He said, "Stay there.
[2:08:06] Stay in that environment that God called
[2:08:09] you."
[2:08:14] Let me find a place to close.
[2:08:19] Oh God, help us today.
[2:08:25] Imagine
[2:08:26] we could go into David. We could go. But
[2:08:29] what strikes me with Ruth, I preached on
[2:08:31] Ruth for probably five or six months.
[2:08:33] And I pulled all I pulled every word and
[2:08:36] everything in. And Ruth goes from before
[2:08:39] she comes out of the Moabitete country
[2:08:41] as a gentile comes up there. Don't know
[2:08:43] nobody. Your God will be my God. Your
[2:08:45] people be my people. Uh your land will
[2:08:47] be my land. And she comes where she's
[2:08:49] nothing
[2:08:52] to owning the land.
[2:08:57] A beggar.
[2:08:59] Now she owns the land. And I'm not
[2:09:02] breeding it to save time.
[2:09:06] When we come to church every Sunday and
[2:09:08] every Wednesday, when these men of God
[2:09:10] are going to get up here and preach and
[2:09:12] sing and worship,
[2:09:14] our thought should be this morning when
[2:09:16] we come. God, I wonder what you're going
[2:09:19] to do today.
[2:09:23] Don't come saying, "Ah, they ain't
[2:09:24] nothing going to happen anyway."
[2:09:27] You're bringing the wrong environment
[2:09:29] outside into the worship house.
[2:09:32] We're all guilty one time or another.
[2:09:35] There's been times when I had to go
[2:09:36] preach. I didn't have no I didn't want
[2:09:37] to go.
[2:09:39] I didn't want to be behind that pullpit
[2:09:40] preaching. That's wrong. That's
[2:09:41] humanity.
[2:09:43] But I'm trying to train myself by the
[2:09:45] according to the law of God's
[2:09:46] environment.
[2:09:47] That's good.
[2:09:49] I'm trying to train myself according to
[2:09:51] law God's environment law that he placed
[2:09:54] an environment here that if I can get in
[2:09:56] that law and then I can bring the people
[2:09:59] up to that law with me
[2:10:02] we should be saying God what are you
[2:10:04] going to do today
[2:10:07] I I I I the limits are unlimitless
[2:10:12] I mean he can do anything he wants to
[2:10:17] whatever you
[2:10:20] If you can find yourself,
[2:10:24] musicians, would you come? If you can
[2:10:26] find yourself coming off of that pew,
[2:10:28] climbing into that environment,
[2:10:31] saying, "God, what can you do for me
[2:10:32] today?
[2:10:34] Lord, I need this and I need this. My
[2:10:36] body's sick. My I need the Holy Ghost. I
[2:10:38] need a double portion." Whatever it is,
[2:10:41] you're able to find yourself raising
[2:10:44] into that atmosphere.
[2:10:47] I've been to heaven and I never left the
[2:10:50] room.
[2:10:52] Wow.
[2:10:54] I've been to heaven, but I never left
[2:10:56] the room.
[2:10:59] When you begin to slack off of praise,
[2:11:03] you can tell it in your life.
[2:11:06] When you begin to slack off of bread,
[2:11:09] if you quit eating literal bread, quit
[2:11:12] eating, you'll you'll get in a bad
[2:11:14] shape.
[2:11:15] Take the same analogy. If you quit
[2:11:17] eating spiritual bread
[2:11:19] where you used to pray two hours, three
[2:11:21] hours, whatever it is a day, you'll find
[2:11:23] yourself down to minutes a day.
[2:11:26] Where you used to walk around the house
[2:11:28] clapping and singing a song, you'll find
[2:11:29] yourself, oh, I don't feel like it.
[2:11:32] If you're not careful, friends, I'm here
[2:11:33] to help you, not hurt you in any way.
[2:11:36] I want you to understand, do your best
[2:11:38] to stay in that environment. Yes.
[2:11:42] Whatever you have to do.
[2:11:45] I find myself on top of this on on top
[2:11:47] of these roofs and I do a lot of copper
[2:11:50] work. I do a lot of historical copper
[2:11:54] work. We make anything and everything.
[2:11:59] And
[2:12:01] I'll be working by myself on a certain
[2:12:04] part and I'm I make it in the shop and I
[2:12:06] go out there put it on. I have to weld
[2:12:07] it and do all this stuff to it.
[2:12:10] And I find myself, brother Jason, I'll
[2:12:13] pull my phone out and lay it down beside
[2:12:14] me and I'll pull up some good worship
[2:12:17] music and song. And I begin to listen to
[2:12:20] that and I'm working and I find myself
[2:12:21] crying.
[2:12:24] I find myself in a position that I'm on
[2:12:27] this roof. It's hot. I'm sweaty. Tony's
[2:12:30] on the other side of the roof working or
[2:12:32] somewhere. We try to separate some on
[2:12:33] some of the smaller stuff.
[2:12:36] and you're hearing everybody walk down
[2:12:38] the the the thing and there and and it's
[2:12:40] just all the noise of the world and I
[2:12:43] begin to tune it out
[2:12:46] and I'm hearing a song from the Henson's
[2:12:48] or the Crabs or somebody
[2:12:51] and I find myself not even realizing
[2:12:54] where I'm at
[2:12:56] and I'm steadily beating and working
[2:12:58] because I beat copper. You know the old
[2:13:00] beaten copper of the old 200 year stuff.
[2:13:04] That's what I do.
[2:13:10] I find myself if I just bring that
[2:13:13] atmosphere on that roof with me and
[2:13:15] create it.
[2:13:17] Brother Brandham said the Bible says
[2:13:19] that we are little creators.
[2:13:26] Let me go a step further. The Bible says
[2:13:28] whom the word of the Lord came to. The
[2:13:30] word which is bread whom that word come
[2:13:33] to is little gods. That's your Bible. I
[2:13:37] didn't say that. The Bible did. Which
[2:13:40] means it's a little G, Brother West.
[2:13:42] It's a little creator where you have the
[2:13:44] ability to be in a situation where you
[2:13:47] can say, "God, I need something right
[2:13:50] now."
[2:13:52] When the world seems like it's spinning.
[2:13:54] Maybe you're getting discouraged. Maybe
[2:13:56] you're finding yourself slipping into a
[2:13:58] depression. Maybe you're finding
[2:13:59] yourself slipping into a place of
[2:14:01] discouragement that you it's just
[2:14:03] getting rougher and rougher. If you can
[2:14:05] find your way to pray, play, begin to
[2:14:08] sing.
[2:14:10] Begin to lift your hand. I go up the
[2:14:12] road and people thinks I'm crazy. I go
[2:14:15] up the road and my hands is in the air
[2:14:17] in the car and they passing me looking
[2:14:19] at me. What is this guy doing?
[2:14:25] If you seen me go down the road, you
[2:14:27] would say, "He needs to be on Bull
[2:14:29] Street.
[2:14:31] I find myself doing this in the car and
[2:14:33] just screaming and crying."
[2:14:39] I wake up at 4:00 this morning. I'm
[2:14:41] walking and walking the floors. I sit at
[2:14:43] the table and it's dark and I begin to
[2:14:46] weep like a baby.
[2:14:50] Amen.
[2:14:53] doing everything I can to bring that
[2:14:56] atmosphere
[2:14:59] because trust me, Satan wants you to be
[2:15:01] in a different one.
[2:15:03] Satan wants you to be so in tune with
[2:15:06] the other side. He wants to place this
[2:15:09] issue and this problem and you to have
[2:15:10] your mind here. He wants He don't mind
[2:15:12] you coming to church, but don't get
[2:15:13] involved.
[2:15:15] He don't mind if if y'all
[2:15:17] fill this church slap up and you have to
[2:15:19] put more tears in. He don't care. That's
[2:15:20] fine. Oh, he doesn't matter. But don't
[2:15:23] participate.
[2:15:24] Oh, children, don't be like that.
[2:15:27] Come to church with an expectation.
[2:15:31] Come to church that God that you say,
[2:15:32] "God, I know you're going to do
[2:15:34] something."
[2:15:43] Oh, if I could climb into that
[2:15:44] environment for just a moment,
[2:15:49] I know something will change.
[2:15:52] If I can climb into that spot, Brother
[2:15:54] Jason, where I know he'll come down and
[2:15:57] meet me there.
[2:16:00] This is your place.
[2:16:03] This is where he's called you.
[2:16:09] Oh Jesus.
[2:16:14] Naomi goes back to the house of bread.
[2:16:18] Brings Ruth with her.
[2:16:23] Boaz, a type of Christ, of course, going
[2:16:25] to be the kinsman redeemer. Throws a few
[2:16:28] handfuls of purpose out for her.
[2:16:31] She's basically a beggar.
[2:16:36] Goes and lays by his feet and marks
[2:16:38] where he's laying so she don't lay by
[2:16:40] the wrong one
[2:16:50] very quickly. Let me say this.
[2:16:53] Esther is one of the most greatest books
[2:16:55] in the Bible.
[2:16:59] You know what's so powerful? The word
[2:17:01] God, if I'm not mistaken, don't quote
[2:17:02] me, go look it up, but I'm gonna quote
[2:17:04] what I think. I've got it in my mind.
[2:17:05] The word God is in the Bible in every
[2:17:07] chapter of the Bible, in every book of
[2:17:09] the Bible, 3,700
[2:17:12] 3,878
[2:17:14] times, I think.
[2:17:17] And not one time is it written in the
[2:17:20] book of Esther.
[2:17:24] But yet Esther
[2:17:26] finds her way to come before the king.
[2:17:31] And the Bible says, Mori says, "Are you
[2:17:33] here for such a time as this?"
[2:17:37] The environment, the atmosphere that's
[2:17:39] around at that time, Hmon's trying to
[2:17:43] kill all the Jews.
[2:17:46] And now God places a woman there.
[2:17:49] And that woman, she's not afraid to go
[2:17:51] before the king. Why? She's changing the
[2:17:54] environment.
[2:17:56] And the king hells out the scepter
[2:17:59] in type of when we come to him, he hails
[2:18:02] out Christ.
[2:18:04] And he welcomes her in his presence.
[2:18:08] And the atmosphere changes. And now
[2:18:10] Hmon's on the news instead of Mori.
[2:18:13] That's right. Cuz God had her there,
[2:18:15] brother West. For such a time,
[2:18:18] God has me and you. For such a time as
[2:18:21] this, the most evil age there is on the
[2:18:24] earth. The greatest message that ever
[2:18:27] come outside of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[2:18:29] And this message is that Lord Jesus
[2:18:31] Christ. I said this message is that Lord
[2:18:34] Jesus Christ.
[2:18:37] And now that same environment's here,
[2:18:40] we're able to take it and climb into
[2:18:42] that spot.
[2:18:48] Just because you're a son and daughter
[2:18:49] of God, friends, doesn't mean you can't
[2:18:51] get on the outside lines.
[2:18:54] That doesn't mean you're not saved.
[2:18:56] Doesn't mean you're not a good person.
[2:18:59] It means just line back up.
[2:19:02] Let's change the environment.
[2:19:05] Every one of us could use an environment
[2:19:06] change.
[2:19:08] Not just me, not just you. Every one of
[2:19:12] us could use that.
[2:19:15] You believe that? Let's bow our heads.
[2:19:18] Heavenly Father,
[2:19:20] oh Lord Jesus,
[2:19:24] let that environment be so strong this
[2:19:26] morning.
[2:19:30] Lord, as we bow our heads and we pray,
[2:19:34] issues, troubles, and problems, Lord, we
[2:19:36] all got them.
[2:19:39] But Lord, you sent a way to change that
[2:19:42] environment that we could climb in it
[2:19:44] for a moment.
[2:19:46] We could come in from the outside into a
[2:19:48] house of bread,
[2:19:51] praise you and honor you and bring the
[2:19:52] glory of God.
[2:19:56] Lord, I pray that you would move upon
[2:19:58] this church, Lord.
[2:20:01] May they come Lord continually bring an
[2:20:04] environment Lord to this building Lord
[2:20:07] that Lord it captivates the minds and
[2:20:10] the hearts of this people that when they
[2:20:12] go out to their workplaces that
[2:20:14] environment so strong them that it
[2:20:17] captivates the people that is around
[2:20:19] them and they wonder oh what do you how
[2:20:22] I want to taste that
[2:20:26] and them as sons and daughters of God
[2:20:28] are able
[2:20:34] and help.
[2:20:37] God, we need environment change.
[2:20:44] May you grant it. If there's any sick,
[2:20:47] Lord, I pray the Holy Spirit would move
[2:20:49] from pew to pew.
[2:20:55] Walk the aisles, Lord.
[2:21:01] Let me say it this way.
[2:21:05] Two men on the road down the road. He
[2:21:06] met Jesus. They don't risen. Jesus, a
[2:21:10] man steps out of the bushes, comes up to
[2:21:11] him. He begins to talk to him. They
[2:21:15] don't recognize him. And they go on
[2:21:16] down. They're talking. They come in and
[2:21:17] the and they start to go in the house.
[2:21:20] And the Bible says, and this is what's
[2:21:22] so striking. I I I continually tell this
[2:21:24] to my church. What's so striking is they
[2:21:25] tell them and the Bible says they
[2:21:27] constrained him
[2:21:32] to come in and stay a while.
[2:21:36] And I told my church, I said, "Constrain
[2:21:38] him
[2:21:40] as he's walking down your aisle in your
[2:21:42] pew. Stop him in his tracks. Constrain
[2:21:45] him. Pull him in.
[2:21:51] For whatever you have need of, constrain
[2:21:53] him. God, I need this. God, my family's
[2:21:57] here. God, my kids, this. God, this
[2:21:59] here. Constrain him. Church, Bethl
[2:22:02] Tabernacle.
[2:22:04] Constrain him to stay with you a while.
[2:22:11] Constrain him.
[2:22:17] Oh Jesus.
[2:22:28] Hallelujah.
[2:22:32] He's so wonderful, friends. He's so
[2:22:35] precious today.
[2:22:38] We're so grateful that he met us this
[2:22:40] weekend.
[2:22:43] Oh, would you stand to your feet today
[2:22:47] and would you give him a hand clap of
[2:22:48] praise for coming and meeting with us
[2:22:50] this weekend?
[2:22:52] [Applause]
[2:22:58] Hallelujah.
[2:23:01] Hallelujah.
[2:23:03] CS, would you give me save, please?
[2:23:07] My Jesus,
[2:23:10] my savior.
[2:23:13] Lord, there is none
[2:23:16] like you.
[2:23:19] All of my days.
[2:23:23] I want to praise
[2:23:27] the wonder of your

[2:29:33] Don't you love him?
[2:29:37] I come just to be a help to say say
[2:29:40] something that'll help you.
[2:29:42] Nothing to hurt you in any if I have you
[2:29:44] forgive your brother.
[2:29:46] Brother Jason, if I've said anything
[2:29:48] that's wrong, you forgive your brother.
[2:29:52] I'm here for only one purpose.
[2:29:56] To fellowship y'all. Amen.
[2:30:00] I'd have been happy sitting in that
[2:30:02] right there and listen to brother Wes
[2:30:04] and these guys and these preachers,
[2:30:09] but I pray something was said when you
[2:30:13] leave today, take that environment with
[2:30:16] you.
[2:30:17] Everywhere you go, remember you have the
[2:30:19] ability to change it.
[2:30:22] I didn't say it would be easy. God
[2:30:23] didn't say it would be easy, but you
[2:30:26] have the ability to do it.
[2:30:28] You're God's children.
[2:30:31] You're God's children. Thank everyone of
[2:30:34] you if you're coming. My precious buddy,
[2:30:36] Brother Lee, and Sister Lily, I'm
[2:30:39] grateful to them to come and support it.
[2:30:42] Thank you, brother sis.
[2:30:46] Appreciate each and every one. Brother
[2:30:47] Jason, love you, buddy. Wow.
[2:30:51] I've had myself a time.
[2:30:53] I've had a good time.
[2:31:02] Brother Wes, I don't get to see you
[2:31:05] much, buddy, but I sure love you. Sure
[2:31:09] love that, man. I usually see him one
[2:31:11] time a year, and that's when we both
[2:31:12] meet up at Brother Donny's.
[2:31:15] I guess that's our meeting place.
[2:31:18] I'll see you in a couple weeks, I guess.
[2:31:22] But I love you. Appreciate each and
[2:31:24] every one of you.
[2:31:26] You ministers, stay on the firing line.
[2:31:29] It ain't no time to slack up now.
[2:31:32] Amen.
[2:31:33] It ain't no time to get slack now,
[2:31:34] friends.
[2:31:36] We got to get out of here.
[2:31:38] We got to go.
[2:31:40] We got to go, brother.
[2:31:42] Just think before we ever meet again,
[2:31:45] brother Jason, he could come.
[2:31:46] That's it.
[2:31:49] It's been eight years since I've been
[2:31:52] something like that. Just thing. It has
[2:31:54] been too long.
[2:31:57] Of course, I can't say nothing. It's
[2:31:58] been that long since you've been to my
[2:31:59] place.
[2:32:03] You owe me one now, though.
[2:32:06] I tell you, he owes me one. Oh, but we
[2:32:09] love him and brother Matt at our place.
[2:32:11] Brother Matt came in November, man. He
[2:32:13] done. Wow. That guy's a preacher right
[2:32:16] there, man. Y'all y'all don't know what
[2:32:17] y'all got in that guy. Y'all ever want
[2:32:20] to get rid of him? Send him to my
[2:32:21] church.
[2:32:30] That guy is he's he's amazing right
[2:32:32] there. That's from my heart, buddy.
[2:32:35] That guy can preach. He preached a storm
[2:32:36] up at my church.
[2:32:39] Everybody's saying, "When you getting
[2:32:40] that Matt guy back,
[2:32:43] he's coming soon because, man, I talked
[2:32:44] to him last night and I got to get
[2:32:47] Jason." My man, Jason's done some of the
[2:32:50] most dynamic preaching at my place. Wow,
[2:32:52] this guy can preach.
[2:32:55] This guy can preach.
[2:32:58] I don't even feel worthy to stand on the
[2:33:00] same pull pit with these guys. They can
[2:33:02] preach and their life
[2:33:05] shows it.
[2:33:07] Amen.
[2:33:07] I love you, buddy.
[2:33:09] Appreciate you. These musicians, thank
[2:33:11] you. I know the work that goes into
[2:33:13] this.
[2:33:14] I've done it. There's some work in this,
[2:33:17] man. Thank you, guys. Sisters, thank
[2:33:19] you. But God's good, ain't he?
[2:33:22] You love him today.
[2:33:24] Amen. Brother Jason, come buddy.
[2:33:30] Praise the Lord. Give the Lord another
[2:33:32] hand.
[2:33:33] [Applause]
[2:33:42] Wonderful time. What a wonderful
[2:33:45] weekend. A lot went into it and it was
[2:33:48] um effort well spent. Praise the Lord. I
[2:33:52] want to say again how much we appreciate
[2:33:54] all of y'all coming out. Uh that's the
[2:33:57] people and we didn't really even hardly
[2:33:58] invite anybody or announce much because
[2:34:00] I knew word would get out on its own.
[2:34:03] And so we probably try to do something
[2:34:06] like this again real soon. I think we
[2:34:08] want to make it maybe our thing. And if
[2:34:10] we're successful in proceliting Brother
[2:34:12] Wesley here, you'll get to see him here
[2:34:14] more often. Did I meant persuade brother
[2:34:17] brother Wesley? Amen. Amen. Praise the
[2:34:21] Lord. But don't get in trouble like
[2:34:23] Louie did getting too much on Matthew
[2:34:25] because Yeah. He uh he went after my
[2:34:27] grandkids one time and I I sent him a
[2:34:30] text. I said, "Brother Louie, I'm glad
[2:34:32] you love my son, my grandchildren, but
[2:34:34] if you ever try that again, I'll have
[2:34:36] you assassinated."
[2:34:41] Amen. Oh, there's so much. My heart is
[2:34:44] so full from a sermon like that. I
[2:34:46] remember years ago when I was just
[2:34:48] starting to preach and Brother Donnie,
[2:34:49] it was first time I'd ever heard of
[2:34:50] somebody say that. Brother Donnie said
[2:34:52] the one thing that'll make him want to
[2:34:54] get a hold of a microphone is coming up
[2:34:56] behind a preacher who can't preach or
[2:34:59] coming up behind a preacher who can.
[2:35:02] Amen. And I wanted to get a hold of a
[2:35:03] microphone because I came up behind
[2:35:05] somebody who can preach. Amen. I would I
[2:35:08] would love to go through my notes, but
[2:35:09] I'd probably make you listen to a whole
[2:35:11] another sermon. But brother Tim, it was
[2:35:13] just remarkable. It seems um my
[2:35:16] goodness, can you imagine that God has
[2:35:20] this environment on purpose
[2:35:23] and has you here on purpose?
[2:35:25] Yes, sir.
[2:35:26] And now that seems counterintuitive,
[2:35:29] doesn't it? But we we have
[2:35:31] counterintuitive things. Less is more.
[2:35:34] Uh the the you know, Socrates said the
[2:35:37] the greatest amount of wisdom was
[2:35:38] knowing that you know nothing. Amen.
[2:35:41] So, we have these kind of
[2:35:42] counterintuitive things. And to actually
[2:35:44] say God literally looks like he allowed
[2:35:47] the age to just become a a catastrophe
[2:35:49] and a wreckage and put you here
[2:35:52] on purpose.
[2:35:55] What an amazing statement. But that's
[2:35:57] how God does it. You know, don't
[2:35:59] insulate yourself from it. You find that
[2:36:01] people who do that cuz it it gets hard
[2:36:03] and it gets hot and it gets heavy. And
[2:36:05] you know what? As pastors we find, I
[2:36:07] know brother Tim will have a an
[2:36:09] agreement to this. When we find saints
[2:36:12] of God, children of God who we know are
[2:36:14] children of God, but they they insulate
[2:36:18] their lives from the from the from from
[2:36:21] taking a stand
[2:36:23] and facing the heat, walking into the
[2:36:26] furnace of Leodysia. They just insulate
[2:36:28] their lives from that. And you know what
[2:36:30] happens? That weakens your faith. You
[2:36:32] get carnal and cold. Don't do that.
[2:36:35] Don't run away from the presence of the
[2:36:36] Lord. Run toward him.
[2:36:38] Amen. Friends, he he's got a lot
[2:36:40] invested
[2:36:42] to have you here.
[2:36:44] Amen. Amen. We've been preaching on on a
[2:36:46] whole series of modern events made clear
[2:36:48] by prophecy. I thought to myself this
[2:36:50] morning, I'm going to eventually end
[2:36:52] this series with a a title called Future
[2:36:54] Events Made Clear in Prophecy, cuz our
[2:36:56] future is bright, friends.
[2:36:59] Amen. The Lord took a Lord invested a
[2:37:01] lot to get me here, to get you here. And
[2:37:03] guess what? He He knew exactly who he
[2:37:06] wanted here.
[2:37:08] He knew exactly you would be here. He
[2:37:10] knew exactly all your faults and
[2:37:13] failures. He knew exactly your
[2:37:15] weaknesses. And he knew exactly this
[2:37:17] would be the kind of people that would
[2:37:19] believe thus sayeth the Lord.
[2:37:21] Amen. So there I go saying I wasn't
[2:37:23] going to preach it by the start. Amen.
[2:37:26] We've had a lovely time. We've got a
[2:37:28] whole afternoon and they're out there.
[2:37:29] The sisters are out there already
[2:37:31] preparing. We got a lot of food. A lot
[2:37:34] way more than we probably We're gonna
[2:37:35] have to send some home unless all y'all
[2:37:37] show mercy and stay around and go in
[2:37:39] there and eat. Amen. And eat. Help us
[2:37:42] eat it up. Amen. We've already bought
[2:37:44] it. We can't take it back. So, uh let's
[2:37:47] let's get it all and and and have some
[2:37:49] fellowship throughout the afternoon.
[2:37:50] We'll keep Brother Tim around as long as
[2:37:52] we can and uh make him shake everybody's
[2:37:55] hand and give you a chance to talk to
[2:37:57] him. Amen. Have you appreciate all of
[2:37:59] our singers and all of our ministry and
[2:38:01] all of our musicians and all of our
[2:38:03] preaching and above all things the
[2:38:05] presence of the living God among us.
[2:38:07] Amen. Praise God.

[2:38:26] Oh, Father, what a what a spiritual what
[2:38:29] a as brother Brandon would say, a
[2:38:31] gastronomical jubilee, Lord, on the
[2:38:33] spiritual food, seven course meal that
[2:38:36] we heard all packed into one sermon.
[2:38:38] Lord, packed into songs and testimonies
[2:38:40] just over the last 48 hours. Lord, we
[2:38:43] feel like we're closer to heaven today.
[2:38:45] I pray now that you will let us take
[2:38:47] this spirit of revival into the week
[2:38:49] coming within our hearts to draw near to
[2:38:52] you, Lord. not not pull away but draw
[2:38:55] near oh God to step up to the plate to
[2:38:58] to endure Lord this age that you placed
[2:39:01] us here and Father to to throw our
[2:39:04] shoulders back and march Lord to the
[2:39:06] step of the gospel. Grant it Father we
[2:39:08] pray that you'll bless our fellowship
[2:39:10] throughout the afternoon. Bless the food
[2:39:14] Lord all the hands that made it possible
[2:39:16] and that are will continue working Lord.
[2:39:18] May it may it be pleasing to you and may
[2:39:21] you be pleased Lord to dwell among us
[2:39:23] throughout the afternoon. Now we commit
[2:39:25] it to you in Jesus name. Turn around and
[2:39:28] shake hands with somebody. Say God bless
