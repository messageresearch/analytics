evening praise the lord i heard you had a wonderful time on sunday a lot of testimonies came back to me i haven't been able to catch that service i got to a few minutes pass for the mass text and haven't been able to figure out finish it up she was rejoicing reports so i started to finish it today ukrainian refugees and uh brother barry has a lot of testimonies and video already from the believers you know men women and one sister at home with four small children and moms are falling and she's just happy and content in the lord not worried about a thing amen and one brother who escaped mary opal which is completely among god's family and uh you know they they see it uh as prophecy coming to pass don't you think they don't they're looking at what the lord said in the book of revelation and they're seeing that that what's happening in real time i'm telling you friends things are wrapping up quickly amen and i i've just been astonished really for there's no better word i could use just astonished at uh the unprecedented things that are happening headlines that i read about the world and the power of the beast moving behind the scenes my my my our home going is soon amen and so i want you to turn with me this evening uh to the book of ezekiel and we're going to look from chapter 9 i think i gave in and so we want to go there and catch our thought for this evening ezekiel is a an amazing prophetic book hinged in between jeremiah and daniel all three of those men uh contemporaries and you know watching things take place jeremiah there in jerusalem and warning them about the babylonian invasion and and then jeremiah finally gets sent to egypt as an old man he doesn't actually go into captivity dies and actually dies in egypt and so uh ezekiel caught the vision that we're going to read tonight about the departing of the glory of the lord and then of course you're familiar with daniel he's actually there in babylon during the um during the uh captivity seventies captivity so it's a lot of activity moving that's all relevant uh to us today amen so let's look in our bibles to um this screen here under this thing does does this power it um this one here i want to turn that off is what i want is that right okay i don't need this one then ah some fiend has stolen my remote uh okay you know i you're right about that and uh i think i may have found it yeah i think i got it praise the lord die like flashing at me like here i am no i'm not high no fine so it's very distracting amen ezekiel chapter 9 and i want by the help of the lord uh to you to speak to you on a sermon that i didn't derive my title until late in the afternoon just trying to find the exact mind of the lord i want to speak on his presence departing ezekiel 9 verse 1 and we're kind of jumping into the middle of the vision it's actually beginning 8 goes through 9 goes through 10 goes to 11. i'm just decided to pick this one spot and then we'll make references back and forth it's not going to be an exhaustive bible study lesson tonight i just want to reference it somewhat he cried also in mine ears with a loud voice saying calls them that have charge over the city to draw near every man with his destroying weapon in his hand and behold six men came from the way of the higher gate which lath toward the north and every man a slaughter weapon in his hand and one man among them was clothed with linen with a writer's ink horn by his side and they went in and stood beside the brazen altar so this one in lenin with the ink horn is going to put a mark and so we're seeing types of the holy spirit coming here a seal who's the only one who can seal is the presence of god and the glory of god of israel was gone up from the cherub but read that again verse three and the glory of god of the god of israel was gone up from the cherub where upon he was to the threshold of the house and he called to the man clothed with linen which had the writers writer's incorn by his side and the lord said unto him go through the midst of the city through the midst of jerusalem and set a mark upon the foreheads of the men that sigh and cry for the abominations that be done in the midst thereof and to the others he said in mine hearing go ye after him through the city and smite let not your eyes spare neither have you pity slay utterly old and young both maids and little children and women but come not near any man upon whom is the mark and begin at my sanctuary then they begin at the at the ancient men which were before the house and he said unto them defile the house and fill the courts with the slain go you forth and they went forth and slew in the city and it came to pass while they were slaying them and i was left that i fell upon my face and cried and said ah lord god will thou destroy all the residue of israel and thy pouring out of thy fury upon jerusalem so ezekiel is seeing this vision of the impending doom when the babylonians come in this is what they're going to do see and so he says here in verse 9 then said he unto me the iniquity of the house of israel in judah is exceeding great and the land is full of blood and the city full of perverseness for they say the lord hath forsaken the earth and the lord seeth not and as for me also mine i shall not spare neither will i have pity but i will recompense their way upon their head and behold the man with linen which had the incorn by his side reported the matter saying i have done as thou has commanded me let's pray master of foreboding passage of scripture lord and we we feel the weight lord of what it is showing us and father we know of course that i'm thankful to you that lord of the the the enemy was going to come in the enemy was going to invade the nation because it had been exceedingly sinful and the enemy was going to slay young men old men maidens children everybody and lord it was really be the devil's children slaying the devil's children because you put a mark upon all of your children and none was allowed to hurt them father we're we're realizing that this is not the passage this is not a passage that speaks of some evil bloodthirsty god this is just simply a god allowing man turning man over to his own devices and allowing him lord to destroy his own self but you saved your children out of it lord you saved anyone you saved everyone who was who was righteous who was holy who loved you who loved your word lord and who were burdened by the sin that they saw in the nation those were your family lord and you let no harm come to them and so father we're asking you tonight now speak to us in the depths of our heart we commit it to you in jesus name amen god bless you friends you can be seated given what an advantage it is to have the presence of god the personal presence of god operating in your life operating in your home operating in this church operating in your children operating in your business given the advantage that it is for god to be present and all of the aspects of our lives you would think that every mortal man ever whoever lived would covet and crave and go to great extremes and do frankly whatever he had to do to be sure that a god that great was in his home and in his life and in his children and in his business and yet we find uh paradoxically the exact opposite of that we find and it's not just today in the hour that we live in it is inarguable historically that mankind around the world all over the world have in the majority in fact is it has always been the overwhelming majority that man just seems to determine to to rid god of controlling his life and take over his own life and and it seems like that that you know men get to the point and it doesn't come suddenly you know when when the garden of eden uh happened that event and here's adam and eve out and then here's abel with a sacrifice and and and it didn't take very long though it didn't happen on day one but eventually cain kills his brother and then god raises up seth and then populations start going and they start talking about building cities and and raising sheep and you've got seth's children who become uh simple people and herdsmen and and and farmers and raising livestock and you find that the children of cain went after knowledge and science and built great cities and and and went after all sorts of things from the tree of knowledge of good and evil and for a while everybody got along for a while there was no more body getting killed everybody saw what happened to cain he had a mark he was well known don't anybody do what he did and that went on for quite a while until finally a man rose up and said you know i'm just not going to do that anymore and he went out and killed seven men and so so we find that right away by the time you go from that sad verse and by the time you get to the days of noah that that first man who who killed the first humans after cain did after that uh the time of peace in the earth then you find that by the time it gets to noah just seven generations after enoch we come to noah and we find out that by that time the whole earth is covered in ungodliness it's become global and the bible says in fact is that except for eight humans the entire world's minds were con evil continuously and perversion was rampant and imagine that that it didn't happen overnight but over a space of time you find and god just finally says that's it i'm going to allow man i'm going to pull out the stops i'll pull out the chucks from the wheels and let the wagon roll over the cliff and that's exactly what happened it was nuclear uh it was an atomic blast that went off in that scientific age and rocked the earth off its axis and and broke up the uh the underground rivers and and shattered the firmament above and flooded the world and man destroyed himself but god preserved his family hallelujah and then we find that it came out a little ways and after a while everything was fine uh it didn't happen on day one or it didn't happen it doesn't really tell us when but it talks about by and by over time noah decides to build a a vineyard and the next thing you know he hits an alcoholic problem and then the next thing you know sin is starting to spread and then the next thing you know you're going to find that they're down in the valley of shinar building attack building a tower and you've got nimrod carrying war to the to his neighbors and and suddenly here we go again and it didn't happen suddenly it just seemed like that that there was a presence of uh uh in in the memories of the earthlings there was a memory of of what god does when when we go in that direction he he he's not some cruel bloodthirsty ogre he he doesn't even want anybody to die in fact as he goes out of his way to try to persuade everybody he won't force him mankind wouldn't want to be forced say why why does god allow all the wars and babies to die and sin to be in the earth because he won't force man to serve him and remember that when god built the earth there wasn't no sickness no babies died there was no war it was man that did that it's man that has done it every time god recycled and they started it again not immediately but after a while by and by it just got worse and every generation got worse until finally god recycled it again and so so we find then that we arrive to a time where god is going to say okay i i'm not going to destroy the earth by water again i promised him i wouldn't do that so here's what i'm going to do i'm going to reach down and find me a man and i'm gonna give him a call and i'm gonna call his name his name is abram and i'm gonna call him and he's gonna believe my word and i'm gonna start with him and i'm gonna craft a righteous nation to show the world uh who the real true god is and it went fine for a while abraham had isaac and isaac had jacob and then they went on and on and on and the history comes all the way to the fact that you finally end up you know with the children of israel down in in egypt and then god brings them out and then they wander through wilderness and they go into a promised land then they take it and for a while everything's going fine until joshua dies and then things start slipping and the next thing you know there's judges coming and you've got all the story of the judges and then finally god's gonna and i'm just making millennial leaps here god's gonna finally bring him a king and he's gonna have and they they pick a bad one a real doozy and he self you know enamored with himself and stuck on himself and and became rebellious and became the enemy of god god ended up saving him because god loved saul he was god's son and he he finally took him off the earth like he will any disobedient son who he loves he set up david and everything looked good and then as if it couldn't get any better solomon comes and it gets even better and so that all the nations around israel are put under under under tribute solomon everybody's afraid of him he's got a gift of discernment he can discern the secrets of the heart he's his his fame is global his army they're terrified of the israeli army and we find that for a while it looked like a millennium but by and by solomon begins to backslide the now now look at what happened israel's starting to go there's going to be a problem and god starts sending prophets you need to repent this is going to be a problem this ain't going to end well and they they you know they abuse the prophets and they kill them and jesus told him said which one of the prophets did your fathers not slay and put to death tell me which one that that designation you ever listen to you're so proud of your prophets and you tried to kill every one of them and killed almost all of them and and so we find out that that you know he said you you you think you you look the scriptures you think in them you have life i am literally here proving that i'm the reality of everything and you're trying to kill me amen and so so you find that that they you know from the time of solomon it didn't happen right off the bat but a little after a while a little more a little more after a little more until finally it gets to the point where we're kings down many kings in uh the ten tribes have already been taken uh but you know and and and the next thing you know uh by the assyrians and then you've got two tribes left and then they're going to be sacked by babylon and and all and you know that whole story how that goes and they're going into seven years captivity and so we find then that you know leading up to this god sends this prophet jeremiah and he's trying to plead with them to say listen this is really mission critical this is serious that you know we were a great nation and all we've done is follow the pattern since the days of genesis where it goes good for a while god comes down does great miracles in our life we have the power of god we have a great king we have a great army we're whipping everybody god grows our crops heals our land gives us money gives us food makes us the leading nation we don't owe anybody any debt everybody owes us debt but by and by by and by it just kept getting a little worse and a little worse until jeremiah now jeremiah's pleading and saying listen you don't seem to understand this isn't going to end well you you're going to keep going in that direction you're going what direction are we going jeremiah away from the glory of the lord you're literally turning away from the glory of the lord your life should glorify god this nation should glorify god your church should glorify god the preachers should glorify god the people should glorify god the young people should glorify god marriages should glorify god and you're starting to get away from it you're starting to get away from it and you're starting to add glamour instead of glory you're starting to add the world instead of the word and well what's going to be the consequence it ain't going to end well because finally what's going to happen the lord will begin to depart and he the thing about it is he doesn't do it suddenly he doesn't do it suddenly he does it in phases because he's merciful and he cries out to his people and by the time ezekiel sees his prophecy here he is you know and i he's brought by a vision and god shows him and takes him to the temple and he sees and god is not gonna god's gonna actually he doesn't have to do it just but just out of out of a determination to to make his to make sure that no one tries to impugn him he's going to begin to show that listen ezekiel i'm going to show you i'm going to take you to the inner court i'm going to show you something i'm going to destroy this place why are you going to do it lord i'm going to show you come on come on with me i'm going to show you now you go home read chapter 8 chapter 9 chapter 10 chapter 11. i'm just going to narrate it for you tonight because it's wednesday and i want to move quickly and he found them with idols right in the sanctuary and men there supposed to be in the house of god supposed to be message believers and got all kinds of idols in their lives that they're worshiping and they're bringing glory to their idols and they're not bringing glory to god and you find that what god does is that he he lifts up from the cherubs and where he was in the holy place between the cherubs and the glory of god lifts from there and moves now he doesn't he doesn't move oh he doesn't completely leave he just moves to the door and he says now let me show you something else jeremiah i mean ezekiel he shows it it shows his ego and he begins to show him this sin and that sin and this secret thing and that secret thing and then still nobody's repenting and instead of getting better they're getting worse and it seems like every generation gets worse and every year they get worse and the nation is going down but when the nation goes down that's when god's family is supposed to shine listen friends the perversions of laodicea the poison toxins of hollywood and sodom and the days of noah which we have a convergence both of them were being doubled with a double barrel of that i'm here to tell you that the world has long ago ejected god from their thinking and their churches no longer have him their politics have long ago not had him and they they they sit in their in their chambers and they they pass all these laws and i was reading today spurgeon was making just a side comment about it and he was almost like in a prayer and saying lord they sit and they pass laws with no regard for the creator who built the whole thing no regard at all we're here we're legislators we're not god's not involved in this really he built the earth you're standing on he he builds the air you're breathing he builds the bodies you're living in he did it for not your glory his glory what do you mean he has no say in our laws oh no no no no we're we're not we're not going to talk about god we're not going to talk about the bible you know we're there we're going to make laws as we see fit all right go ahead it ain't going to end well it's never ended well you find that finally you know the the lord moved and i and i and just off top my head i think his next movement was he first moved to the south to the south entrance and he stood there a little bit longer and god rich in mercy slow to anger that takes no pleasure in the death even of the wicked once every man to come to salvation wants every man to live why will you why will you not come to me that you may have life why are you determined to keep going in that direction do you not realize my that my glory god would not stay in that temple he wouldn't share that temple with an idol he's not going to share your home your heart your mind your activities your christianity he's not going to share that with the world and then he then finally he moves again and he moves a little further he moves into the east and then finally he moves out of jerusalem and he sees and the last time he saw him he was on the mountain headed out of headed out of judah judea he's literally just going to leave the whole tribal land and he's going to just fly off to heaven and then they've got no one there to keep the babylonians out he didn't do it overnight he doesn't he doesn't treat you like that you know we we have to constantly think about in our lives friends as this world is steeping and getting darker and darker and darker and the power of the enemy is rampant across the earth and god god already knows the world has ejected him but he's calling to his family he's calling to his children he called you out of those systems and said don't stay in there and die come out of her my people lest you end up suffering her plagues i'm not telling you that god's family is going to go through the tribulation but i'm here to tell you something friends god is watching our lives he looks at our heart he considers our motives and our objectives and his question is is your life bringing me glory amen or is your allegiance divided is your allegiance between me and the world divided you know jesus said you couldn't do that you can't serve god and mammon you can't serve god in the world you're going to love one and hate the others say i would never hate god you'd be amazed what the human being is capable of when the glory of the lord departs and there's been many a home that started out so wonderfully many a young person that started out full of fire many churches many preachers many many things that started out so strong and so good i'm here to tell you something friends we can't ever sit on rest on our laurels we can't just lay back we got to keep going forward undesiring forward undesired i'm not here to say oh my word it's great we've got a great anointing we've got great music we're going to build a new building we've got new families coming in you think the devil's going to take that laying down i'm here to tell you we're going to have to press harder we're going to have to have more sincerity and i'm going to tell you something right now if the devil has begun to divide your attention between the glory of god and the glory of the world you need to abandon the enemy and run back to god and say have mercy on me lord and re re-light my fire some of us need our fire relent tonight so i remember a time when the glory of god surged in my life i remember a time when i couldn't wait to be at church i remember a time when prayer came so easy i remember a time when i could sing and raise my hands and now i can hardly i can hardly keep from counting the minutes till the preacher finishes so i can get back home to my stuff oh i'm here to tell you something friends this world is burning down and it's giving satan all the glory but there's got to be some people who say all glory to god my life is going to be a testimony to the glory of god it was sad you know they had god had been so gracious like he is to us he was so personal when moses says show me your glory and here's this is a difficult question moses you understand that that's just not something willy-nilly you want to see my glory that's big that's not like you wanting to go see a a mulberry tree you want to see my glory i don't do that very often very few people in the whole world get that kind of insight on me but moses i love you and here's what i'll do you can't see my face not and live so i'll put you in the cleft of rock i'll find a way moses to show myself to you and what i do will be sufficient i'm here to tell you something friends you can you can go to god tonight he can't respect persons you might want to say lord i don't know what i'll be in that glorified body someday i know i'm going there but could you show me something of it tonight could you let some kind of a an anointing come upon me that i can feel the surge that thing that's going to change my body one of these days hallelujah let that let that be in my morning and in my daytime and in my evening time hallelujah let me think about that on the job let my mind be on heavenly things lord i want to feel your presence i want to feel your nearness because when you're near everything's all right when you're near all things are possible when you're near i don't have to free it from afraid anything when you're near all my needs are assured when you're near victory is mine when you're near i can overcome the world and i want that more than anything lord hallelujah what happened to you i i got a change inside my soul and that says brother matt was i heard this part of his sermon how that same power that that will change your body is the same power that brings that gene to life it brings your soul in the presence of almighty god but it's not two different powers god was willing they wanted to know something about him he was so it was personal enough to grant israel's request and he took pains to explain his ways and you can read it in the scriptures i mean so many places we could turn to tonight we're to save time and we won't but you know they wanted to know about what are your requirements and i mean you have to tell them that he could just wait for him to step in a hole and smack him in the head well you're not supposed to do that you know but he was gracious okay well don't do this thou shalt not do that and you shall not do this and remember i'm holy and remember the sabbath and remember this covenant and remember your promise and if you'll keep your word i'll keep mine i'll kill all your enemies i'll grow all your crops i'll i'll multiply all your households you'll have children in abundance you'll have health you'll have liberty you'll have plenty of money you have plenty of food you'll you'll be the lender not the borrower you'll be the head and not the tail you'll be the nation favored by me and that's how personal god was willing to be and went into great detail through the book of exodus and through numbers and through deuteronomy and through leviticus and and he began to show exactly his ways and his nature and what was expected and the people look at that and said we'll do it yeah we're in man i'm you're gonna do that for us we'll definitely do all this for you they didn't they didn't and even for a while god kept up his end and you know they'd get to get to a point where he'd just have to come down and bring a little parental correction on they'd line up right quick and then he would let the blessings flow again and they'd make some more progress and and he said every time every time i do that for you you forget me every time i'm good to you every time i bless you every time you pray and i come on and i help you and then you thank me and then you forget me and you're you're more interested in your own agenda than my agenda what's your agenda lord that you be a holy nation as an example to the world so that if they never open a bible you know if if if school chums never open this they'll they'll read this every day looking at you young people if if they if this city never reads this they can still see the believers out here at night they can still hear our sermons we're on we're broadcasting online our speakers are running outside we stand out of the yard with love and and and fellowship one with another and we move in the community and they see that we're honest men and honest women and that we're hard workers and that we're decent and we're moral we're not like the world and we don't want to be at all not even a little bit i it it is you know this is what this is what paul was referencing you know that when when he started talking about you know women's hair and men's hair and this dress and this conduct and this and paul's whole emphasis if you read the whole thing in its entirety what paul is trying to get them to to realize is that not only do these break covenants of god and and make bad types and and and it's it's it's you do certain things for the sake of the angels everything but here's here's another big here's another big one that you don't ever don't ever whatever you do this is paul's instruction whatever you do don't ever be found in public and somebody because of the way you're dressed or talking or acting or doing somebody would accidentally mistake you for not being a christian that somebody would actually not realize you're a christian and they would mistake you for a person of the world and paul was saying that is the most sad shameful thing that could possibly happen to you amen because your whole purpose of being here is to be to bring him glory your whole purpose is to glorify god in the way you talk and the way you act and where you go and what you do and and and i'm here to tell you there's too many times that god's family hear me friends there's too many times especially here with with so much of the world to offer and god's children who used to know him in the power of his resurrection who used to have a fervent prayer life who used to never miss church and now the slightest thing interrupts that entire program and they're full of carnality and worldliness and they don't care about their prayer life or their church schedule or their children amen who watched that example and learned from it said brother jason can you please leave town again and i will i'm going this weekend i wasn't going to preach this tonight i get totally different notes i brought out two sets of notes in case the lord let me out of it he hasn't we're supposed to bring him glory and god takes the time to send you a message and a messenger with with intricate detailed testimonies of the power of god and what pleases god and how to be happy in your home and how to have how to have the holy ghost and how to have the how to have the authority over devils and how to how to be under the blessing of almighty god and how to witness in the community and we have no excuse friends we have no excuse we have no way that nothing that we can blame except the man in the mirror god is so personal and he's so willing to help you know i think about paul when he got struck down on the road to damascus there i stood right there where he got launched out of the saddle and hit the ground and i i think about his conversation that he has with god seeing that great light and who are you lord brother branham jumps in to help us with clarity and says now he was a scholar see he he knew what that light was he would have never called something lord but he knew wow we haven't seen that since that left the temple they they that when god lifted up between the cherubims and went to the south door and went to the east store and left jerusalem and went to judea and went over the mountaintop and and and left judea and he never again appeared in the earth until he laid in a manger wrapped in swaddling cloth and that manger was a much greater image of him than the than the one that left the tabernacle because the tabernacle represented him and god would live inside of him like he would live inside the tabernacle but because of the people's sins he had to leave that tabernacle he would never leave this baby he would live he and he he was filled with the spirit of god and brother bam talks about that holy ghost in him and could never leave him and had to be with him all the way into eternity i get the anointing left him in the garden and he went to calvary as a man that's uh in the mystery of the godhead that we're not preaching on that tonight but but but now here's paul and he suddenly he found the lord to be much more personal than all his theology training had ever taught him i mean paul was a theologian of theologian pharisee of the pharisees as touching the law blameless zealous eager energetic here's the man who volunteered to do everything for god and now here he is smacked out of the saddle laying on the ground can't see a thing but he sees a bright light he hears a voice so it's all why persecutest thou me wait what who are you lord all my theology i never had you speak to me i read about you i never imagined you would actually talk to me all my life i've studied you all my life i've been serving you wow is this ever personal i'm kicking i i'm resisting you yes whoa how is that possible i'm a scholar i'm a pharisees of pharisees who are you how am i resisting you i'm jesus you're talking about a paradigm shift suddenly that brother had something he had to think about you're jesus yes i never put that together well you do now paul and and you're you're persecuting me because you're persecuting my family and then he goes and and we and we find that you know i mean it wasn't that paul wasn't acquainted with what the pillar of fire was i hope you're gathering paul's astonishment it's not that he's unacquainted with the pillar of fire he knows what that is he knew theologically god dwelt in light he knew that he knew historically that he appeared to israel like that in the past but he hadn't been seen like that in hundreds of years not since the days of jeremiah when he lifted up from the holy place and was seen heading back to heaven not something you'd really want to see really to see god to see god leave your church to see him depart from your life depart from your home oh friends that should make us tremble this gradual departure as as is so often the case then who better than who better to warn than paul to come to the church and say listen i thought i knew him but i'm here to tell you now that i had to forget everything to really know him i had to just forget everything everything i thought that i knew about him i didn't even i realized now i didn't know him at all i didn't even know he was jesus all i knew was what theology had told me all i knew was what history had told me all i knew was what i could read in the prophets i never imagined he could be so personally known well guess what he is and he can and he wants to be known by you that way and that's where he goes into those you know where he says there what what things were gained to me i counted loss for christ i was i was preaching uh and had some a little bit of amusement the way i went at it on sunday morning there and hickory you know kind of had everybody wondering what in the world for the first 10 minutes i said now today i'm going to be very transparent i want to be honest before everybody and everybody you know they're starting to you know okay well this is going to be serious but jason he's going to go say some things i said you know i just want to speak to you from my heart and i just want to tell you that i'm a loser and they all wait what yeah i'm a loser and i said you know i said but now don't you know normally the street term loser you know is somebody who don't know a good thing when they got it and and and they ruin it by just stupidity and just being dumb or being inconsiderate and they just gotta go you don't know a good thing and hit you in the face and you ruined it now man you're a loser i said i'm not that kind of loser i said i'm the happy loser and i said because i followed paul and i lost everything so that i could know christ i said i'm such a happy loser i said i'm probably the happiest loser of all time and probably i feel like the happiest loser in history because i lost it all to gain it all i gave away the world i gave away my dreams i gave away my motives and my objectives i didn't want them anymore i met jesus and i didn't want to be me after that i wanted to be him oh he took away friends from me that would have harmed me and led me astray he took away opportunities in business i could have had because he knew it would pollute my life he took away a family he took away opportunities and i'm here to tell you i've never been so happy to lose everything and gain christ amen what things were gained to me it's amazing when you read that because paul when he's talking about you know i count all things but lost for the excellency of the knowledge of christ jesus for whom i have suffered the loss of all things and then he goes down this whole list of really good credentials born the circumcised the eighth day of the stock of benjamin man that's check that's a winner uh a pharisee of the pharisees check man uh touching the law blameless check check check i mean here's paul and he's going down all of these all of these things he's not calling them bad in fact is what he says in verse seven is but what things were gain he's not saying they weren't gain he's not saying god you know god just took all the bad things you god took good things from you things that could have gave you more money things that might have made you more popular things that might have made you more acceptance things that might have allowed you to bypass some persecution and have and not have such a hard time i mean it got god god you know what he's saying is i took all of the good things that were gained to me and when i compared them all to christ i counted them as rubbish as garbage as dung heap i didn't want any of those advantages i only wanted christ i wanted the glory of the lord to shine in my life i wanted god to have sway in my every day i wanted my life to count for something eternal that's where i'm at friends that's where i hope you are i mean this world isn't getting better it's getting worse you know i i can't help but turn one more corner and just got to follow the instructions of the lord you know i realized as i've grown older that like paul i wasn't interested in my own righteousness anymore i wasn't any more interested in my own accomplishments even the good ones what i needed i remember that day i remember you know i i told the hickory church there a little bit of my own testimony and you know born into the message and you know still in the womb of my mother when she's coming to the lord baptized in jesus name gets the baptism the holy ghost shouts all over the place speaks in a language not our own and i'm insider they call me the holy ghost baby sister mom the holy ghost baby raised up there in the tabernacle heard tapes every day of my life say you went to church every day no but sister mom played him every day and if we went at home listen to him we was at church listening to him and and and friends with the branham family and grew up with those guys and friends and my parents friends with their their parents and sitting there seven years and you know i think about all the advantages but i had to come to a place one day where i said you know with all of these advantages these are good things these are all good advantages i was healed under his ministry of an incurable disease i set as a baby under that anointing as he operated his ladder his ladder pulls but you know something i found myself like paul and i can remember i can remember as a young man you listen to me young people you don't have to be very old to give your heart to the lord completely and i remember as a young man saying to myself what has all of these advantages got me i'm still missing that fervency i'm still missing that personal i'd read paul i'd read john i'd read the stories of brother branham i'd read the the the old saints and the old war heroes of the faith and my my heart my young heart would burn and i knew that i hadn't finally had to reach a point where i couldn't get in on my parents coattails and i couldn't get in on my own advantage i had to have a personal experience with this god i had to make up my mind that today my life is going to bring glory to god and i'm not going to keep going down the road bringing glory to the world i'm done with that it's the greatest decision huh my only reason what's your greatest regret that i didn't do it when i was even younger oh i'm here to tell you something friends there's nothing like serving god there's nothing like being pleasing to god there's nothing like having him as a friend having him as somebody closer than a brother somebody who'll help you talk to you love you care for you amen this day this world is going into complete chaos and the the trumpets and the seals have wound themselves out and the vials breaking forward in the earth this these things are not accidents you're watching the world go up in flames and i'm here to tell you if there was ever a day when you need to shine in the glory of god this is that hour this is that hour to make your life count for something and say i'm not going my way anymore i realize that time has met prophecy and i i didn't i could have been in some other age god put me right here amen if he put you here with me then that means he's got as much confidence in you as he has in me and i'd like to pay him back for some of that confidence how many would like that tonight say i want i want to i want to get on board i want to start returning this investment oh i want to be a retirement of investment that's positive for god i want my my testimony in my life and i want the zeal of the spirit i want to have a prayer life i want to have a bible life i want to have a church life i want to have family life i want to have godliness let's stand to our feet friends i i take your word for it you take my word for it i'm here to tell you god takes all of our word for it show him again say lord i'm here tonight and i want to make that pledge to you i don't want to go the way of the world it's ending and i want to bring glory to your name lord hands everywhere you really mean it hold them up there say lord in all my life i want to bring you glory oh master hands all over the building father you saw in my own heart finding it strange to take this angle tonight wasn't what was on my mind in the early part of the day but lord i knew your anointing when i felt it i knew your direction and i can see the effect upon the people and it's affecting my heart lord i'm pledging allegiance to you i'm refreshing myself in the spirit this world in its darkness i want to be a bright shining light in this world lord i want to show respects to you i want to lay down whatever i have to lay down i want to walk away from whatever i got away walk away from take it from me lord god even things that might be a gain i want to count it as a loss [Music] if losing it can give me more of you yeah lord even things that might be a gain and i worked hard to get it i finally struggled and sweated and grinded it out and i finally got it and now i'm hearing tonight a preacher say well if you give it up you might could get more glory of god in your life what say you friend oh as the head and hearts are bowed now why don't you take a few moments to speak to the same god moses spoke to speak to the same god paul spoke to say who are you lord will you show me your glory in all my theology i thought i knew you in all my training and my upbringing and i've been in this church and brother jason's been my pastor and brother branham and i my mom and dad and my grandparents but but who are you who are you to me do i know you in the power of your resurrection am i willing to know you in the fellowship of your sufferings being made conformable unto your death may i know you in that way lord may everyone in this building know you in that way grant it to us lord these are dark times [Music] we see things unraveling so quickly i've been astonished at the pace of things that are that we've been looking at in prophecy for years wondering we know it was coming but what will it look like when it gets here and we're seeing it and it's happening all around us lord all right i avoided it but you're not going to let me i'll ask i want every head and heart bowed every head and heart bowed on behalf of the lord may i say and ask you a question where were you when his glory began to depart and you didn't know it what were you doing just like israel they were still going to church they were still walking into the temple right while they're in their worshiping they don't even know you're leaving church was just a routine to him serving god was just some [Music] some human thing that we do because well we just should and we'd do it and whatever didn't really mean much to him anymore they still showed up to church they still walked right in they still started still started to bring their offerings of praise sing their songs raise their hands go through the motions and he and here's the prophet who's been lord you you grabbed him by the by the hair by the nap of his head and you lifted him up in the air over the top and looked down into the temple as if there was no roof on it and he and saw them worshiping and they were not even aware you had already left the cherubs you were standing at the south door they never even knew then you went to the east and they never knew then you left jerusalem and they never knew you left judea you went over the mountain and headed off back to heaven and they never knew they never even knew your glory was departed it was never coming back not under that system no way where were you friends the lord just drilled this into me to ask you on his behalf have you been unaware as the world has sifted your mind contaminated your spirit with i don't even say sinful things just things that aren't lending to your righteousness just stuff over the world and your prayer life is not as easy as it used to be your your fellowship your church attendance your commitments to god your your strict holiness you've begun to get carnal and edgy and look like the world act like the world dress like the world follow the world chase the world be loved by the world be popular by in among the world what are you doing come to your senses do you not know the glory of the lord is departing lord it should it should grip our hearts it gripped mine today thinking about it i said lord god lord as far as i know i'm a complete absolute bona fide 24 carat gold believer i'm absolutely a believer lord there's not a trace of doubt in my heart i perfectly believe this word i love you with all my heart i love you with all my mind and all my soul but i'm also aware that this flesh buffets me and i'm also aware that i could be more fervent and i could have more zeal and i could be i could be more reliable and dependable oh god help me help us as a church lord god as these closing hours are dropping upon the earth and the history of mankind coming to an end where were we when we were unaware that the glory of the lord was departing it sounds hopeless lord and if i hadn't if i couldn't this very minute go on over some more chapters go on past 8 and 9 and 10 and 11 and go on past you departing and go over into the 40-somethings and 43 and on from there because that same light that left returned from that same east way he went home and he came back according to his promise and he restored that's his promise i'll restore you i'll bring you back to a nation again i'll live among you and you'll be my people lord god let him come tonight in our lives oh god let

really meant that to the lord and say lord i need help and i want to be free of that and i want to go forward faster harder god will meet that need brother branham said you show your respects to god by by being willing to lay things down and then god can get behind that and bless it see but you got you've got a part to play in that you've got to make decisions and say i'm going to stop doing that
