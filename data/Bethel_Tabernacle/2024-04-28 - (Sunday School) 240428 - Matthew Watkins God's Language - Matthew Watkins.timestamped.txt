[0:00] and then little book of Zephaniah just
[0:03] want to take one scripture from there
[0:05] then I'll have you be seated Zephaniah
[0:07] chapter 3 verse 9 we're going to teach
[0:09] this
[0:10] morning on God's language God's language
[0:14] for then I will turn this is Zephaniah
[0:16] 3:9 for then I will will I turn to the
[0:20] people a pure language or this is the
[0:23] word return I will return the people a
[0:28] pure language that they may all call
[0:32] upon the name of the Lord to serve him
[0:34] with one consent you can be seated this
[0:36] morning it's incredible um brother
[0:39] brandham out of the uh Church age book
[0:42] and we're just going to sort of be uh
[0:44] all over the place this morning all over
[0:46] the map I should say I don't really have
[0:48] uh notes I've not taught Sunday School
[0:50] in a long time so y'all are going to
[0:51] have to forgive me for uh being Rusty
[0:54] I'm not don't consider myself a teacher
[0:56] but none of the other brothers who are
[0:58] apt to teach are good at uh good
[1:00] teachers were available so I'm the spare
[1:03] tire this morning but um we just want to
[1:06] um just cover this just here for a
[1:08] moment the God's language brother
[1:11] Brandon says that the Book of Revelation
[1:13] and we're speaking about God's language
[1:15] he says that the Book of Revelation is
[1:17] the revelation of the seven Church ages
[1:21] so we know that in the scripture the
[1:23] Bible would refer to this uh it would
[1:26] refer to it as the fullness of the
[1:29] Gentiles
[1:30] and so remember that word Gentile means
[1:33] other nations or nations so the way that
[1:36] God views not the way that man but the
[1:38] way that God views Humanity as he views
[1:41] Humanity as one lump as brother brandham
[1:43] said out of one lump uh as a Potter
[1:47] would take one lump of clay he makes
[1:49] vessels of Honor vessels of
[1:52] Dishonor and he makes Jews and Gentiles
[1:56] Nations people that are non-jews and he
[1:59] shows how that the fullness of the
[2:02] Gentiles the seven Church a would be
[2:04] called the seven Church ages and so we
[2:07] know that the way that God views time is
[2:10] very different than uh well let me say
[2:12] it this way the way God views time is
[2:15] the only way that matters it's the only
[2:18] way that matters how we understand time
[2:20] or history really doesn't matter how
[2:22] philosophers teach history doesn't
[2:24] really matter it's how God views history
[2:25] or his story and so we know that God's
[2:28] way of viewing time time is through this
[2:31] time this this this uh Gentile time is
[2:34] called ages or dispensations Seven Ages
[2:39] and brother brandham says for out of the
[2:42] Revelation now remember this this say
[2:43] how he says this the Revelation uh The
[2:46] Book of Revelation is the revelation of
[2:49] the seven Church Ages which is the
[2:51] fullness of the Gentiles for out of the
[2:55] revelations out of
[2:57] Revelations uh the revelation of the
[2:59] seven ages comes every other
[3:05] Revelation and so this is the way God
[3:07] always communicates he doesn't
[3:09] communicate through intellect or
[3:11] knowledge or education but God actually
[3:14] speaks very specifically through
[3:17] Revelation now you you you have to you
[3:21] you can find this all throughout the
[3:23] Bible you could find it from in the Old
[3:25] Testament uh all the way through
[3:27] prophets the way that that prophets
[3:29] would speak it's even incredible to me
[3:32] even the Book of Daniel and what's
[3:35] what's amazing I'm going to say some
[3:36] things today that maybe would surprise
[3:38] you uh but uh it surprised me too when I
[3:41] when I learned them but I think it's
[3:44] important to understand these types of
[3:45] things that Christendom as a whole or
[3:49] the opes of Christendom and when we're
[3:52] talking about that that encompasses
[3:54] everything that encompasses uh
[3:56] Evangelical non-denominational
[3:58] denominations
[3:59] all the way through Christendom uh um up
[4:02] until present time that the way that
[4:05] they approach God or the way that they
[4:09] approach the Bible the way that they
[4:11] approach salvation the way that they
[4:13] approach uh
[4:15] church is is categorically very
[4:19] different than how a True Believer
[4:22] does and you'll find this all the way in
[4:25] the beginning through Cain and Abel who
[4:28] had two ways to approach God two totally
[4:32] different ways and so I I want you to I
[4:36] want to make it as simple as we can this
[4:38] morning to to say it this way there is
[4:41] only two approaches to God there was
[4:45] always only two approaches to God and
[4:49] you'll find that number running in
[4:51] parallel to the prophet of God would say
[4:54] there's the mark of the beast or the
[4:58] seill of the Holy Ghost am there's only
[5:00] two there's nothing in the middle
[5:02] there's no multiple choice there's one
[5:04] or the other in this age the mark of the
[5:06] beast or the Seal of God and brother
[5:08] Bram says it this way you'll take one or
[5:12] the other think about how important that
[5:14] is here for a moment every human Jew
[5:18] Gentile Muslim atheist doesn't matter
[5:23] will take one or two approaches to God
[5:26] the mark of the beast or the seill of
[5:29] God which is the baptism of the Holy
[5:31] Ghost and we see this all the way
[5:34] correlated in Genesis at the very
[5:36] beginning that there were twins there
[5:39] were two boys and one was of the seed of
[5:42] one was of the seed of God one was of
[5:44] the seed of The Serpent and we know that
[5:47] this would carry on past Cain and Abel
[5:49] how did it all begin past Cana and Abel
[5:51] then you had a Seth you had a nimrod you
[5:53] had God's seed following all the way
[5:55] throughout history and then uh Satan's
[5:58] seed and so there was always two
[6:01] approaches Cain's approach was not
[6:04] satanic as we would call what we would
[6:06] call satanic or ritualism or or Ouija
[6:09] boards or Voodoo or
[6:12] witchcraft that wasn't the way of Cain
[6:14] Cain wasn't a devil the Bible uh brother
[6:17] bam said that Cain had in his heart he
[6:20] wanted to serve God he wanted to worship
[6:23] God and Cain here's Cain and Abel here's
[6:26] two two but notice this is something
[6:28] that God was setting in Foundation
[6:30] remember that everything that you see
[6:32] presently is only a fruit of the
[6:35] original
[6:36] seed and so the the Genesis remember is
[6:39] the seed chapter it's the book of
[6:41] Beginnings it's every you want to know
[6:43] how to understand everything in the
[6:44] world today everything in your life go
[6:46] back to the seed chapter you'll
[6:49] understand that everything that you're
[6:50] seeing today and I mean everything that
[6:53] covers everything is only a fruit or the
[6:57] fruition of that seed chapter of Genesis
[7:01] and so we notice that there was always
[7:03] two approaches to God a way of Cain that
[7:06] Jude refers to and then the way of the
[7:09] sons of God the seed of
[7:11] Seth uh and and and it was the seed line
[7:14] of God and so that one way we're not
[7:17] teaching on that here this morning and
[7:18] we'd get bogged down on it but we know
[7:20] quite simply that one was a way of blood
[7:23] and one was
[7:26] bloodless I could I could condense it
[7:29] down to that one was a bloodless way
[7:33] approach to God one was a way that came
[7:36] through blood or the shedding of blood
[7:40] and so we know that this would all I
[7:41] want you just to some of these we have
[7:43] 30 minutes so it's a you know it's a
[7:46] it's a uh just you have to just sort of
[7:48] hit highlights here and let let it let
[7:50] Revelation drop in but remember that
[7:52] that it's always two the way of Cain a
[7:54] bloodless way the way of Abel uh the way
[7:57] of the blood or the way we could say of
[8:01] intellect and reasoning rationalism
[8:04] common sense you have all of these
[8:07] things the the the human mind the you
[8:10] know through education through science
[8:12] civilization all of those things and
[8:14] then you have the way of Abel which was
[8:17] a way that was revealed unto him let me
[8:21] say this Abel didn't have a book he
[8:24] didn't have a teacher he didn't se he
[8:26] didn't he couldn't study a scroll
[8:29] but God was going to communicate through
[8:33] what what Zephaniah refers to through
[8:35] pure language what is that language you
[8:37] asked brother Matt well you'll find that
[8:39] all the way throughout the bible let me
[8:41] just give you a couple because I I I
[8:42] just want to I think if I give these two
[8:45] examples rather than trying to lay a
[8:47] huge Foundation it'll just bring you
[8:48] right up to where I'm at think of
[8:51] something in your Bible you have the
[8:53] Book of Daniel now now Daniel it's so
[8:57] incredible and I don't want to we're not
[8:59] going to take a lot of time with this
[9:01] but I'm just going to give you two I
[9:02] think two would be good two good
[9:03] examples to to
[9:06] illustrate uh the language of God and I
[9:09] know I've taught on this before and so
[9:11] just give me a moment just just uh to to
[9:14] be able to uh to to say this without
[9:17] taking up uh the entire Sunday school so
[9:20] um what's
[9:22] incredible uh give me just a moment to
[9:24] find my place here uh what's incredible
[9:27] is that you can divide
[9:29] The Book of Daniel into two halves this
[9:32] is just one example I'm going to use you
[9:34] could actually divide the Book of Daniel
[9:38] uh into two halves and you could you
[9:41] you'll understand that actually the Book
[9:45] of Daniel is written in two
[9:48] languages did you know that originally
[9:51] now you have it in your King James Bible
[9:53] and it's all in English you said brother
[9:54] Matt what are you talking about here
[9:56] well the original Book of Daniel was
[9:58] actually written in two languages
[10:02] because Daniel could be divided into two
[10:05] halves we could say and so Daniel the
[10:08] introduction of Prophecy when he begins
[10:11] to talk about
[10:12] prophecy um he's actually referring to
[10:16] Daniel chap 11 So Daniel 11 and on take
[10:21] you could take notes if you want on this
[10:23] um the the the first The Book of Daniel
[10:26] covers 75 years of d Daniel's life from
[10:31] chapter 1 through chapter 10 you're
[10:33] going to catch 75 years of his life but
[10:37] then after Daniel 10 Daniel 11 and on
[10:43] covers thousands of
[10:45] years because Daniel is actually going
[10:48] to turn from speaking of Daniel I want
[10:51] you to catch this he's it's going to
[10:54] speak of
[10:55] Daniel and then it's going to speak of
[10:58] Prophecy that would outlive Daniel or go
[11:01] beyond Daniel and so it covers thousands
[11:05] of of of history and so Daniel sees way
[11:09] off into the distant uh future actually
[11:11] with such accuracy now listen with such
[11:17] accuracy that 2third of Christian not
[11:21] atheist Christian Scholars today
[11:26] say that that part of Daniel was
[11:29] inserted after and is not
[11:34] inspired now that may shock you but it's
[11:41] true large large uh portion of biblical
[11:46] Christian men view the The Book of
[11:48] Daniel that Daniel there's no way the
[11:52] Book of Daniel could have recorded some
[11:54] of the historical things that would take
[11:57] place years after Daniel leaves the sea
[12:01] we're not teaching on that today but if
[12:02] you go and read some of the things that
[12:04] Daniel prophesies concerning Antioch as
[12:07] Epiphany specifically who is the
[12:09] Antichrist of BC or before the Common
[12:13] Era before Christ comes on the scene and
[12:15] you have Judah mccabes in the book of
[12:17] the hasmonean Empire that rose up to
[12:20] come against the salusin empire and hel
[12:22] helenistic culture that had invaded the
[12:24] Jews not preaching on that don't get
[12:26] lost in that I just want to tell you
[12:28] that if do a little research in history
[12:31] you'll find that Daniel laser accurately
[12:35] prophesies of this and he doesn't just
[12:39] stop there the the the the the the
[12:41] empires that would raise up that Daniel
[12:43] has of the Giant stature of Daniel's
[12:46] vision would go through every Empire
[12:49] that would come in the
[12:51] world and what does men do with that
[12:54] they they have a choice you either have
[12:56] to believe that God has a language that
[12:59] he speaks that is beyond human knowledge
[13:02] or intellect or you have to conclude
[13:05] that Daniel's not inspired and sadly
[13:08] many people do and it wasn't always that
[13:13] way in fact that was a generational
[13:16] shift that happened in what we call the
[13:18] enlightenment you read literature
[13:20] surrounding the Bible and you'll watch
[13:21] that the attitudes of Scholars changed
[13:25] and there's two key things that they
[13:28] change on not the text not the scroll
[13:32] not the dialect not the language but
[13:35] what choked them was two things
[13:39] Miracles and
[13:42] prophecy those are the two things that
[13:44] are unexplainable because they don't
[13:46] they don't it's not speaking our human
[13:49] language you follow me and so Miracles
[13:53] and prophecies are used or considered to
[13:56] be proofs of the inspiration of the
[13:58] Bible and so uh uh uh used to be
[14:01] considered Miracles and Prophets that
[14:03] are used to be considered proofs of the
[14:04] Bible and so you'll see these that
[14:07] people uh you know look at the
[14:10] miraculous and they look at the prophecy
[14:13] and the Prophecies of the
[14:15] Bible and they consider them you know uh
[14:19] that it would be impossible and so
[14:21] people say well if you just cut out the
[14:23] Miracles and cut out the prophecies I
[14:25] could believe the Bible and so instead
[14:27] of helping people to believe it's God's
[14:30] book it actually hinders people you say
[14:34] who what people brother Matt the
[14:35] intellectual mind or the way of Cain's
[14:38] approach to knowledge to understanding
[14:41] to God's
[14:43] word and so they treat them Miracles as
[14:46] fiction rather than fact as myths
[14:49] actually in Legends I know I taught on
[14:52] this here uh before but it was
[14:55] incredible when we we we spoke about the
[14:58] modern
[14:59] uh archaeological fine of the cities of
[15:02] Sodom and Gomorrah you remember that and
[15:04] you could watch that video some people
[15:05] requested it from me I'll just note this
[15:07] just for a moment that these were two
[15:10] Scholars these were two Christian
[15:12] Seminary trained men that had stumbled
[15:15] upon these cities of sod this
[15:16] archaeological dig where they had found
[15:18] the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah and
[15:20] these archaeologists had said we believe
[15:22] we found the ancient Dead Sea cities and
[15:24] here they come they ask them were there
[15:26] arrowheads no there were not then what
[15:29] destroyed the cities of Sodom and
[15:31] Gomorrah these Christian men pressed
[15:32] these archaeologists and they didn't
[15:34] want to answer the question and when
[15:35] they finally pressed them enough the
[15:36] archaeologist said well we call it a
[15:38] heat
[15:39] event and they said well what's a heat
[15:41] event what do you mean by a heat event
[15:43] how what's a heat event well you know it
[15:46] was it was it was natural disaster okay
[15:49] well what do you mean heat of it and he
[15:50] said well when we looked at the pottery
[15:53] that we found in the Dig we we thought
[15:56] that it was tainted because on the back
[15:58] of the pottery there was glazing the
[16:00] pottery was glazed raise your hand if
[16:02] you've heard this okay good that's about
[16:06] half so let me just quickly Breeze over
[16:09] this they found that the pottery was
[16:12] glazed and so they they thought the Dig
[16:14] is Tainted this is not the ancient city
[16:16] of Sodom and Gomorrah because it
[16:18] couldn't be because te Pottery glazing
[16:20] didn't happen until the Byzantine period
[16:22] Well after this the you know the ancient
[16:26] period of Sodom and Gomorrah but these
[16:28] men these archaeologists sent the
[16:30] pottery off to a lab and said Analyze
[16:32] This glazing what is this and the pur
[16:35] the the the scientists came back and
[16:37] said that's not glazing that's and I
[16:39] could say this wrong because it's been a
[16:40] while I'm going to give you a word that
[16:42] you won't understand and I don't
[16:44] understand because they argued that man
[16:45] didn't even understand it I believe it
[16:47] was called
[16:48] trinitite and they
[16:50] said what you're seeing is not glazing
[16:53] it's trinitite and he said what in the
[16:54] world is trinitite and she said oh
[16:57] that's easy trinitite is what happens to
[17:00] Pottery when it reaches nuclear bomb
[17:05] temperature and she pointed to the the
[17:07] bomb in New Mexico that they blew up and
[17:09] she said this is what they found is that
[17:11] Pottery looks laaz he said what are you
[17:13] saying she said sir what I'm saying is
[17:15] whatever piece of pottery you found has
[17:17] been in
[17:19] heat equivalent to a nuclear
[17:22] bomb and so you say brother Matt what
[17:24] does that mean well they conclude Sodom
[17:27] and Gomorrah was nuked
[17:29] and it
[17:31] was but not man's nuclear bomb God's
[17:34] nuclear bomb and so but I don't I say
[17:37] all that to say it was incredible
[17:38] because you say well that validates the
[17:40] Bible Well I didn't need that to
[17:42] validate the Bible now if I only spoke
[17:45] the language of human intellect and
[17:47] reasoning then yeah I would need that to
[17:49] validate my understanding but I
[17:52] understood because God spoke to me and
[17:54] revealed it to me in a way that wasn't
[17:56] revealed through scientific
[17:57] archaeological
[17:59] evidence and these two Christian men
[18:01] were laughing saying isn't it so awesome
[18:04] and the one man says to the other these
[18:05] are Christian Scholars the one man says
[18:07] to the other it's so encouraging because
[18:10] I my whole life have just looked at the
[18:12] story of Sodom and Gomorrah as one of
[18:14] those mythical parts of the
[18:17] Bible now you see how rub that rubs I
[18:20] don't know about you friend that rubbed
[18:21] me the wrong way the mythical
[18:24] part I'll just say it this way if I
[18:28] believed that there were mythical parts
[18:30] to God's Bible I wouldn't believe
[18:34] it
[18:36] no and so so they they said it's
[18:39] mythical part so this is the way that
[18:41] they approach these kind of stories it
[18:43] was you know it's validated so they
[18:45] believe the woman at the well was added
[18:48] and and Mark 16 was added they study
[18:52] textual criticism and textual variance
[18:55] through manuscripts and they try to DCT
[18:57] deduct it down they they've missed it
[18:58] that God doesn't reveal himself that way
[19:02] and if you try to find God that way you
[19:05] might find it to your own satisfaction
[19:07] but you won't be able to satisfy the
[19:09] carnal mind Beyond any certainty of what
[19:12] we call certain because you're speaking
[19:15] of things that aren't from this
[19:18] Dimension and so they're not validated
[19:22] yeah are brother Matt do you believe
[19:23] that the Bible's validated and proved I
[19:25] do Beyond A Reasonable Doubt let me just
[19:28] go further and say that I don't believe
[19:30] the message that way
[19:34] either but some we talk about the way of
[19:37] knowledge the way of Cain some have just
[19:39] understood the message through this
[19:41] deduction and reason intellectual
[19:44] understanding but when you hear God's
[19:46] language it reveals it to you in a way
[19:49] that studying and comparing scripture to
[19:52] scripture and and quote to quote can
[19:54] never give
[19:57] you and so they cut out these two things
[19:59] even the even the the the the woman at
[20:02] the well you know they say was at and
[20:05] this is how that they they they the
[20:06] modern mind treats God this is how they
[20:09] treat even the Book of Daniel but what
[20:11] you'll find even about the The Book of
[20:12] Daniel that's so amazing is that um the
[20:16] first half chapter 7 let me let me give
[20:19] you this
[20:21] so you'll find that that chapter let me
[20:25] just cover it fast chapter 1-6 of the
[20:29] Book of
[20:30] Daniel um you'll find This Book of
[20:33] Daniel you remember me doing this before
[20:35] and I'll do it again you could take the
[20:37] Book of Daniel not the Bible because
[20:39] remember the Bible the the to the to the
[20:41] Jews these were Scrolls one scroll you
[20:43] could take it and divid it hold it in
[20:45] half and you'd have two halves of this
[20:47] book the first half is Miracles and the
[20:50] second half is prophecy all of the first
[20:52] half is M miraculous all the second half
[20:55] is Daniel prophesying of Kingdoms that
[20:57] would come Kingdom that would raise
[20:59] kingdoms that would end and so those who
[21:02] have difficulty with the supernatural
[21:04] don't know what to do with the Book of
[21:07] Daniel it's the same way that Christian
[21:09] men treat the Book of Revelation it's
[21:12] not important was it part of the cannon
[21:15] maybe most of them don't believe that it
[21:18] was so what do they focus on Matthew
[21:22] Mark Luke and John say brother Matt do
[21:24] you believe in that absolutely but you
[21:26] understand that that's
[21:29] history
[21:31] hello so mankind always doesn't have a
[21:36] problem the human mind doesn't have a
[21:38] problem if you can keep God contained in
[21:41] a box of
[21:43] History they're okay with that they'll
[21:46] create religions and churches and pull
[21:47] pits and people and they'll be good
[21:49] moral people because you put a God in
[21:52] history who doesn't speak anymore he
[21:53] doesn't talk anymore he already spoke
[21:55] and we just now analyze what he said but
[21:58] when you say God did speak yes we look
[22:01] at what he said but I also believe God
[22:03] is still
[22:06] speaking then it becomes
[22:09] dangerous because now God is still
[22:11] speaking he still has a pro he still has
[22:13] a voice he's still using gifts hold on
[22:15] see it's easy to contain God Hebrews uh
[22:17] 9 I believe it is says it this way uh uh
[22:20] it says that uh refuse not him who
[22:27] speaketh for if they they escape not who
[22:30] refused him who spake from Heaven how
[22:33] can we escape from him who spoke from
[22:35] the earth another words don't people
[22:37] don't have a problem refusing they don't
[22:40] refuse the God who spoke they refuse the
[22:42] God who
[22:44] speaks and so so Daniel the chapter uh
[22:48] Daniel 1 through let me go fast through
[22:51] this so the first six chapters are easy
[22:54] to understand and we know them all well
[22:56] from Sunday school Daniel and the lions
[22:58] den Shadrach Meshach and abedo we know
[23:00] you
[23:01] know Meo TI you far and all the
[23:03] handwriting on the wall you know all of
[23:05] those stories that you hear from Sunday
[23:07] school but then if you turn your Bible
[23:09] over to chapter 7 through chapter 12
[23:11] it's much harder to understand most
[23:13] can't quote anything from Daniel 7 to
[23:16] 12
[23:18] most be because you think what is in
[23:20] there well because the human
[23:22] intellectual mind loves to hear the
[23:24] story story story Daniel linon but then
[23:27] that human mind goes prophecy what is
[23:29] that oh but to a Believer it's their
[23:32] language and so the second 7 to 12
[23:35] chapters interesting fact as we said
[23:39] chapter here's what's here's what's
[23:40] interesting I remember I spoke I told
[23:42] you I'm just going to use two examples
[23:43] here they are here's one and I'm going
[23:45] to give you the second one chapters 1
[23:48] through six of Daniel is written in the
[23:50] third
[23:53] person go read your Bible you'll find
[23:55] that Daniel he and D Daniel said it's
[24:00] always the third person chapter 7- 12
[24:03] there's a shift and it says I
[24:06] Daniel so now it's not the third person
[24:09] it's the first person remember we're
[24:11] talking about God's language let me say
[24:13] it to you this way chapter 1-6 was
[24:16] written for the whole world chapter 7-2
[24:19] was only written for those who had an
[24:20] ear to hear am and so 7- 12 are I Daniel
[24:26] the so we could say the first half of
[24:28] the books of Daniel is all about him the
[24:31] second half is by him the first half is
[24:35] what happened in Daniel or during
[24:37] Daniel's life the second half is what
[24:40] happens after Daniel's life and some of
[24:43] it we could say happened some of it is
[24:45] happening and some of it will happen
[24:48] long after we're
[24:49] gone so the first half is present we
[24:52] could say the second half of Daniel is
[24:54] future why did God write the Bible this
[24:56] way because God has a language
[24:58] am and so the most unusual difference
[25:02] between those two halves is that the
[25:04] first half chapter 1 through6 and the
[25:07] second half chapters 7-2 has something
[25:11] so incredible about it the first this is
[25:13] you're going to you're going to get a
[25:15] tongue twister here so listen close the
[25:17] first chapter of the first half is
[25:21] written in Hebrew the language of
[25:24] Hebrew which was the language of the
[25:27] Jews but the next five chapters are
[25:30] written in Aramaic which was commonly
[25:35] understood by everybody the masses it's
[25:38] the official language of that time it
[25:41] was used everywhere in the ancient world
[25:43] Aramaic so why God would you write
[25:45] because one was meant to be read and
[25:49] understand by one group of people all
[25:51] Humanity but then another was to be
[25:54] understood only by one people amen and
[25:58] so the first chapter is another key the
[26:01] first chapter of the second half is the
[26:04] reverse it's written in Aramaic and the
[26:07] next five chapters are written in Hebrew
[26:11] you say brother Matt what are you saying
[26:12] it tells you where the chapters were
[26:14] meant to be read or who they were
[26:17] directed towards so you could tell which
[26:19] parts were meant to be read
[26:22] widely and then which parts I hope
[26:25] you're catching it friends there's parts
[26:27] of your Bible that is meant and written
[26:30] for the whole world to understand then
[26:32] there's portions that are only written
[26:34] to
[26:36] you I got one thing to say thank God
[26:38] I've got an ear to hear and eyes to
[26:42] understand because I'm a better person
[26:44] no I'm smarter that's surely not true
[26:49] but because of one what is the reason
[26:50] brother Joe
[26:52] Grace
[26:53] Grace God's grace and so so that's the
[26:58] first first let me let me give you
[26:59] another example of this have you ever
[27:01] called Matthew chapter 14 look there
[27:03] quickly if you could we're going to
[27:04] close here Matthew chapter 14 Matthew
[27:07] chapter 14 let me hear those Bibles
[27:09] Bibles Bibles Bibles bring your Bible to
[27:11] Sunday
[27:13] school preach brother Matt you didn't
[27:15] bring yours no I
[27:16] didn't so if you got a phone and you got
[27:19] that that's fine too Matthew Chapter 14
[27:22] verse 13 you got that for me Gideon
[27:25] Matthew chapter 14 put that up verse
[27:27] 13-2 1 this is something incredible and
[27:31] it's about the multiplication of the
[27:33] fishes and Loaves Matthew 14 when Jesus
[27:36] heard of it parted
