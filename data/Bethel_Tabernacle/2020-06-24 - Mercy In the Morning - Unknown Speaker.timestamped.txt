[43:42] Heavenly Father we thank you Lord
[43:44] tonight we can rest in your mercy lord
[43:48] 'as Father as Jeremiah wrote limitations
[43:52] father and Lord and and as he would look
[43:55] over the ruin and the utter destruction
[43:57] of Jerusalem the captivity of your
[44:00] people Lord and he would weep father but
[44:02] he comes to the verse that we've read
[44:04] and said Lord it's because of your
[44:06] mercies that we are not consumed for
[44:08] your Mercy's new every morning great is
[44:11] your faithfulness Lord how we see Lord
[44:14] how we can testify of that in our own
[44:15] life as we see our life Lord Eric your
[44:17] mercy is what's kept us father it's what
[44:20] brought us here tonight Lord whether
[44:22] Lord were streaming online Lord in a

[44:39] if you want to display that PowerPoint
[44:42] you can do that at any time morning
[44:44] mercy I'm going to make a lot of
[44:46] comments here tonight and shift maybe
[44:49] just a direction that the Lord
[44:53] not sure what all we'll cover here
[44:56] tonight but we'll get to what we can get
[44:58] to and then move on and then no and then
[45:00] it's Wednesday it's already 7:45 so we'd
[45:03] like to just look at this it's an
[45:05] amazing thing when you look at mercy in
[45:09] the Bible and when you look at this when
[45:13] you look at this word just that
[45:15] lamentations is speaking of here it's
[45:17] amazing because lamentations was written
[45:19] by Jeremiah and actually in the Hebrew
[45:22] Bible the lamentations it's it's a very
[45:25] hard book to read if you've ever tried
[45:26] to pick up your Bible and read the book
[45:28] of limitations it's just it's a sad book
[45:32] it's definitely what Solomon speaks of
[45:34] when he says there's a time to
[45:36] everything and he says there's a time to
[45:38] weep a time to mourn and this is this is
[45:41] Jeremiah as he is seeing God's kingdom
[45:45] God's Tabernacle his temple is destroyed
[45:48] and he's seen the destruction and and
[45:52] he's seeing that God's people are being
[45:54] taken away and drawn away and it's just
[45:56] a it was a horrible time to live in in
[45:59] those days and actually that's why it's
[46:01] called lamentations the Hebrew Bible
[46:03] it's called simply tears that's what the
[46:07] Bible the book is named that's named
[46:09] tears and it was Jeremiah lamenting it
[46:12] was him crying in him lamenting over
[46:15] just the destruction and the horror that
[46:18] was taken place in the kingdom of God
[46:21] but it's an amazing thing because he
[46:23] comes to verse the verse that we just
[46:25] now read and verse 22 and he says it is
[46:28] of the Lord's look at it again in
[46:30] lamentations verse chapter 3 verse 22 he
[46:35] says it is of the Lord's mercies that we
[46:37] are not consumed because his
[46:40] Compassion's fell not they are new every
[46:43] morning great is thy faithfulness he was
[46:48] saying this of the Lord that were not
[46:50] totally what Jeremiah could see is that
[46:52] in spite of the captivity they weren't
[46:54] wiped out consumed means to be
[46:57] annihilated means to be completely
[46:59] destroyed and so this is somehow
[47:01] Jeremiah able to see light in the midst
[47:06] of darkness
[47:07] he was able to see some what we would
[47:10] call just a ray of light you ever been
[47:12] in such a bad situation and it just
[47:14] looked so dark and so hopeless but
[47:17] somehow you see a ray of light and this
[47:20] is this is the ray of light that
[47:21] Jeremiah sees in his lamenting and his
[47:24] weeping and he says it's the Lord's
[47:26] mercies that were not consumed because
[47:28] his compassion fells not they are new
[47:31] every morning great is thy faithfulness
[47:36] you'll find this in the one of the only
[47:39] rays of light in this entire book it's
[47:42] the one bright spot in the book and I
[47:45] think it's in Chapter five there are
[47:47] five different lamentations that he that
[47:50] he gives it's one of the only bright
[47:52] spots that you'll find but what it's so
[47:55] amazing is that he points to the mercy
[47:57] of God and you know there's there's
[47:59] something amazing when you just do a
[48:01] Bible study on what mercy is because the
[48:05] Kingdom of the world doesn't live by a
[48:07] law of mercy but where we live by a law
[48:10] of merit everything is a azmerit it's
[48:14] what you've merited is what you receive
[48:16] but the kingdom of God is not
[48:18] established on merit it's established on
[48:21] mercy and we have no claim on the mercy
[48:24] of God that's why it's mercy it's what
[48:26] God gives us though we're undeserving of
[48:29] it and what's awesome about this
[48:31] undeserving love of God is that it never
[48:35] ceases never ends jeremiah says his
[48:39] mercy doesn't his compassion doesn't
[48:42] cease it's new every morning and it's
[48:47] his mercy and and and you know mercy can
[48:49] take a form maybe different a different
[48:52] form in one situation in your life than
[48:56] it would maybe in another situation you
[48:58] know you could look at the mercy of God
[49:00] as brother branham looks at the the the
[49:03] Holocaust and he says that was as the
[49:05] world looked as such and it was terrible
[49:07] horrible thing to happen in their
[49:10] history but the prophet of God stood
[49:12] back beyond all of it and got the aerial
[49:15] view of God's view and seeing that God's
[49:17] people were scattered as the Bible
[49:20] predicted
[49:20] they would be they were scattered in the
[49:22] entire earth and so God was going to use
[49:25] something to drive them back to their
[49:28] homeland because only in their homeland
[49:31] could they receive blessing and so
[49:33] brother Branham says what was that
[49:35] Holocaust he said it was the tender hand
[49:38] it was the tender mercy the tender
[49:40] loving hand of Jehovah we don't often
[49:44] see the tender loving hand when we look
[49:47] at the Holocaust and very much so we
[49:50] don't always see the tender loving hand
[49:52] when we see what God does even in our
[49:54] own life and reminded so just yesterday
[49:58] I was contemplating and pondering this
[50:01] and thinking about here was brother our
[50:03] brother Steve persone when he was here
[50:05] last time and you'll remember he spoke
[50:07] about origins and how that he had always
[50:09] he had started to get bitter to God and
[50:11] God why did you not allow me to have a
[50:13] father and he loses his father at 13 his
[50:16] father leaves divorces his mom moves
[50:18] back to Greece and he lives his entire
[50:20] life just almost with a cold spot hard
[50:24] spot in his heart to say Lord ah I could
[50:26] have found a had a father I could have
[50:28] helped him and I could have loved him
[50:30] and then you know life goes on and then
[50:31] brother Steve meets his father goes to
[50:33] Greece meets him and then it grows even
[50:35] greater a greater bitterness because now
[50:37] he starts to see this man and he's
[50:39] missed out on all of his life and
[50:41] brother Steve sees his children and and
[50:43] thinks all what what they've missed out
[50:45] on a grandfather and now they've missed
[50:47] he's missed out on grandchildren and why
[50:49] did this have to happen and Lord why did
[50:51] you keep me from the love of a father
[50:53] and I've lived with just a mother and
[50:55] and raised by a single mom and and you
[50:57] know it's it's how we get sometimes when
[50:59] we start to weigh and we start to
[51:01] measure our life and why this happened
[51:03] and why that happened and you remember
[51:05] brother Steve said but then he brought
[51:06] his children on the next trip I think it
[51:08] was the next year and he gets to meet
[51:10] his grandchildren who he's missed out on
[51:12] their entire life and he says and then
[51:14] you know he showed us that picture of
[51:16] William and his and his father you know
[51:19] pointing that point of his finger at it
[51:21] and saying now William you know you're
[51:22] gonna make a fine young man and you're
[51:24] you're Yura you know you're not a
[51:26] Canadian
[51:26] you're from Greece and you should be
[51:28] proud Grecian and and and here they are
[51:31] caught up in this moment and then his
[51:33] father begins to say you know if you
[51:35] ever heard of this song Frank Sinatra I
[51:37] did it my way
[51:38] and he says now you do William you live
[51:41] by that law he says that you should
[51:42] become that should become your law that
[51:44] you live by
[51:45] do and you think of that Frank Sinatra's
[51:47] I did it my way which we preached on
[51:50] this here before that the author of The
[51:53] Satanic Bible labeled that song is the
[51:56] most satanic song written ever because
[52:00] it's a it's Satanism in essence I did it
[52:04] my way I didn't let anybody do tell me
[52:07] what I was gonna do or I was gonna do it
[52:09] my way and here's his father saying to
[52:11] his his you know his grandson you live
[52:13] by this law of you do it your way and
[52:15] Steve said suddenly in that moment so
[52:18] the Holy Spirit spoke to me and said
[52:19] this is why I kept you from the
[52:22] influence of this man you know what it
[52:25] was it was him recognizing the
[52:27] bitterness that he had give that he had
[52:30] received it was the tender loving hand
[52:32] of Jehovah it was the tender mercy of
[52:36] God now we may not always get that aha
[52:39] moment in this life job didn't get it in
[52:42] this life but in the other life job got
[52:44] that aha now I know why song says will
[52:48] understand it better by and by so it's
[52:51] the mercy of God
[52:52] it's his mercies that we are not
[52:55] consumed this is what Jeremiah says he
[52:57] says great is thy faithfulness they are
[53:00] new every morning and and whoa and
[53:04] that's an awesome thing to think about
[53:06] that mercy is new every single morning
[53:09] there's something so powerful I begin to
[53:11] think about this that there there's
[53:13] there's there's something so special
[53:15] about the morning and and if you've when
[53:18] I go to Tucson and I'm always there on a
[53:21] three-hour time shift so I'm mourning
[53:24] for me it starts at about 5:00 a.m. but
[53:27] long before at least for the first few
[53:29] days you're waking up early in the
[53:31] morning I remember I was there and I
[53:33] just the the morning the Sun begin to
[53:36] come up the Lord begin to deal with me
[53:38] on something so special
[53:39] about the morning something so special
[53:42] about the sunrise even the Bible speaks
[53:45] of this and we have the slides here if
[53:47] you'll just advance those to the first
[53:49] slide I don't have any control over here
[53:51] so just advance it
[53:52] this is lamentations the one that we
[53:54] read verse 23 says that the mercies of
[53:57] the Lord notice there new every morning
[54:00] and there's something so special to God
[54:04] about the morning time you remember even
[54:07] in your minds brother Branham ministers
[54:09] on this and he says God doesn't the Holy
[54:11] Spirit doesn't like the night time and
[54:14] he said spooks come out now he said evil
[54:16] spirits come out at night and he said he
[54:18] said so don't don't he said they come
[54:20] out late so you children don't stay out
[54:22] late that's the devil's business he he
[54:25] works in the darkness he works in the in
[54:28] the nighttime where there's no light and
[54:30] he says but there's something brother
[54:32] Adam says there's something God loves
[54:33] about the morning he says if you ever
[54:35] want to meet God just wake up early one
[54:37] morning he said he'll be there the
[54:40] presence of the Lord you know the
[54:41] nearness of the morning that you feel
[54:43] you know when you when you're when
[54:45] everything is just fresh and this is
[54:47] what Jeremiah saying he says that the
[54:50] mercy of the Lord comes with the morning
[54:53] so something about the dawning of a new
[54:56] day it's something about the the the
[54:59] ending of of a night and the beginning
[55:03] of a new day
[55:05] you remember David's I think it was who
[55:07] said this he says that morning meaning
[55:09] Elmo you are in morning like crying
[55:12] morning May last for the night but joy
[55:15] comes in the morning so there's no
[55:19] there's no season of your life of
[55:21] sadness as Solomon says that everything
[55:23] there's a season there is no season of
[55:26] mourning that will last forever very
[55:29] much like that there's no season of
[55:31] laughing that lasts forever but our life
[55:33] is made up of ups of an ever evolving
[55:36] morning midday evening brother Adam says
[55:40] it's you watch the Sun as it begins to
[55:42] creep up it's like a babe in the morning
[55:44] starts off so young and he says then it
[55:46] goes through its life it's midday it's
[55:48] the middle of the day then it goes into
[55:50] the cool of the evening then before you
[55:51] know what the Sun Goes Down
[55:53] and he says but it's back up in the
[55:55] morning so so this is what David says
[55:57] that morning may last for a season
[55:59] Solomon says there's a season for
[56:01] everything there's a season for laughing
[56:03] there's a season for embracing there's a
[56:06] season to not embrace as we've learned
[56:08] in kovat 19 that's a season we're in we
[56:10] don't embrace and Solomon says but there
[56:13] will be a season that we embrace again
[56:15] and I'm looking forward to that season
[56:17] but but there's a so there's a season to
[56:20] everything that you go through in life
[56:21] there's a eviden there's a middle and he
[56:26] says morning may last for the night but
[56:30] joy comes with the morning because mercy
[56:35] is new every morning it's a new chance
[56:38] it's a new start and the storm may last
[56:41] a long time but here's a powerful
[56:43] statement I read someone sent me and it
[56:45] said no storm has ever lasted period
[56:52] simple sentence no storm in history has
[56:56] ever lasted think about that here just
[56:59] for a moment powerful when you think
[57:00] about no storm has ever been permanent
[57:04] the Sun has always shined again no
[57:08] matter what hurricanes have came through
[57:10] and you can give your history there the
[57:11] horriblest storm the were storm at Genoa
[57:13] that's in the past this is the present
[57:15] this is the now don't live in the storm
[57:18] from yesterday there's a morning mercy
[57:21] that's here and he says the mercy comes
[57:24] in the morning they are new every
[57:26] morning great is thy faithfulness go to
[57:30] the next slide this is in Genesis 27
[57:33] notices something special about the
[57:34] morning here it came near and kissed him
[57:37] and he smelled the smell of his raiment
[57:38] and blessed him and said see the smell
[57:40] of my son is as the smell of the field
[57:42] which the Lord has blessed therefore God
[57:45] give thee of the dew of heaven do is
[57:50] something very special because as the
[57:53] morning is is a new day it's and let me
[57:57] just say this as I go back to my point
[57:59] here before we go further there in in
[58:01] Tucson and the Sun it was very early 5
[58:04] a.m. and I was just there
[58:06] preparing for the Sunday morning service
[58:08] and up so early because it was 8 a.m.
[58:10] for my body but but just sit there and
[58:12] watch over the mountains as the Sun
[58:14] began to the lordís begin to speak to me
[58:16] and I just thought you know you know
[58:18] what's so powerful about this morning is
[58:21] that this morning you know what so
[58:23] listen let me get your attention here
[58:25] because I don't want you to miss this
[58:26] you know what's so powerful is the Lord
[58:28] began to deal with me and I said you
[58:30] know what's so powerful about this
[58:32] morning that's different than yesterday
[58:33] morning say boy brother Matt something
[58:37] must have been special about that day
[58:38] there was something very special about
[58:39] that morning this is what was special
[58:42] that day had never happened yet nothing
[58:46] had happened it was brand-new you know
[58:50] what wasn't there
[58:51] history wasn't there yet begin to think
[58:55] about this powerful principle about the
[58:58] morning and about the freshness and and
[59:00] this is the light this is the ray of
[59:02] light that Jeremiah sees as he looks at
[59:04] the destruction and he's lamenting and
[59:06] he says it's because that compassion
[59:08] that mercy were not consumed
[59:10] he says for your mercy it ceases not
[59:13] it's new every morning history isn't
[59:17] there my past isn't there what happened
[59:21] yesterday is yesterday this is a new day
[59:24] this is a new opportunity in God I don't
[59:26] live on merit I live by mercy oh my
[59:29] brother my sister it's not I don't have
[59:31] a right to a house it's the mercy of God
[59:33] I have one I don't have a right to rain
[59:35] it it's the mercy of God that I have won
[59:38] the world lives by rights I don't have a
[59:40] right to breathing into air into oxygen
[59:43] it's the mercy of God that I have then
[59:45] we live not by a system of merit we live
[59:48] by a system and a law of mercy and it's
[59:53] a clean slate there's something special
[59:55] about the morning it's a clean chance
[59:58] it's a fresh start it's a blank canvas
[1:00:04] it's a another chance maybe that's what
[1:00:09] you're hearing tonight let the Holy
[1:00:11] Spirit begin to speak to you his mercy
[1:00:14] is new every morning
[1:00:17] forget what happened yesterday forget
[1:00:19] the mistake of yesterday or last week
[1:00:22] today's another chance
[1:00:23] today's a fresh start mercy was new when
[1:00:27] you woke up this morning dew was there
[1:00:29] you didn't ask for it to come but it
[1:00:31] arose whether you seen it or not whether
[1:00:34] you woke up early enough to go out in
[1:00:37] your yard with bare feet and fill the
[1:00:39] dew on the grass it was there whether
[1:00:42] you seen it or not let me give you the
[1:00:44] message of God the mercy of God whether
[1:00:47] you have experienced that or not or felt
[1:00:49] it or not or seen it or not God renewed
[1:00:52] his covenant of mercy to you when you
[1:00:55] woke up this morning somebody say praise
[1:00:58] the Lord
[1:00:59] so what's not there it's another chance
[1:01:02] the old nests of yesterday is gone it's
[1:01:06] been replaced by the freshness of today
[1:01:10] the night is over as David said the
[1:01:12] morning is over the joy has came in the
[1:01:15] morning it's been replaced the night
[1:01:17] though it was long as I sat there and
[1:01:19] watched the Sun all of the shadows begin
[1:01:22] to just to slowly flee and flee and you
[1:01:25] watch through the canyons and through
[1:01:27] the ridges and through the saddles all
[1:01:29] the shadows that were there just begin
[1:01:31] to fade and fade as the Sun rose upon
[1:01:33] them the shadows ran away the night was
[1:01:39] over it's been replaced by the crispness
[1:01:42] of life there's moisture there was
[1:01:45] moisture as I watched there looked into
[1:01:46] the wash and all the the little cactus
[1:01:49] is they they were wet and there was
[1:01:50] water and you know there in the desert
[1:01:52] it's so important because it's so dry
[1:01:54] it's some of the only water that they
[1:01:56] get is the dew that comes in the morning
[1:01:59] and it was there was moisture on
[1:02:01] everything though it was dry through the
[1:02:03] night though it was through a season of
[1:02:05] dryness now there was do you know
[1:02:09] powerful thing here about dude appears
[1:02:12] 34 times in your Bible did you know that
[1:02:15] the word do appears 34 times in the
[1:02:20] Bible and anytime you look at
[1:02:21] that word do it really almost always is
[1:02:24] speaking a representative of a blessing
[1:02:27] something that God has blessed you by
[1:02:31] it's it's it's uh let me just find it
[1:02:33] here I had some notes on it it appears
[1:02:36] 34 times in the Bible you'll find in the
[1:02:40] Bible used in different poems or poetry
[1:02:43] that you find it it speaks about the dew
[1:02:45] of the morning the dew of the earth that
[1:02:48] speaks symbolically it's very different
[1:02:51] than what the Bible when the Bible
[1:02:53] speaks about the blessing of rain are
[1:02:56] you here tonight
[1:02:57] you see rain is also a blessing but rain
[1:03:00] can also be a curse rain can destroy as
[1:03:02] much as it can help you get a torrential
[1:03:05] downpour it can destroy a manicured lawn
[1:03:07] that you've worked on or something you
[1:03:10] get the wrong kind too much rain can
[1:03:11] cause a flood it's very different when
[1:03:14] you look at rain but it's amazing but
[1:03:17] after the Passover the Jews and even
[1:03:19] today you can go to my Jewish learning
[1:03:22] calm and the website that I frequent
[1:03:24] have frequented many times to learn
[1:03:26] about Jewish culture and and you can
[1:03:29] just learn so much about it it is based
[1:03:31] biblically but it's amazing because they
[1:03:33] celebrate that you celebrate the Talalay
[1:03:37] holas how they say it and it's the it's
[1:03:39] a song that's a it's a prayer for do
[1:03:43] it's a prayer for moisture it's a prayer
[1:03:46] for blessing and they they they sing
[1:03:50] this prayer a blessing of do and it's
[1:03:52] it's a if you'd listen to the words it's
[1:03:55] saying God will you bring light out of
[1:03:58] the darkness we sing that Psalm waymaker
[1:04:02] and in the words it says he's the light
[1:04:05] in the darkness I'm glad he's the light
[1:04:08] in the darkness and this is Israel pray
[1:04:11] and say Lord where you bring light out
[1:04:13] of darkness and and they says and it
[1:04:15] says out of darkness to draw to draw
[1:04:19] Israel to himself as a root finds water
[1:04:23] from Dew and begin to think about this
[1:04:28] because if you think about the morning
[1:04:30] and you think about what comes in the
[1:04:32] morning
[1:04:32] do you think about rain rain is
[1:04:34] something you always you almost not
[1:04:36] always but almost always you can hear it
[1:04:39] you can you can hear it coming you
[1:04:41] suddenly are in your house and though
[1:04:42] it's raining you can hear the rain
[1:04:44] outside and you know and if it catches
[1:04:47] your attention it can be you can hear it
[1:04:49] especially when it's a torrential
[1:04:50] downpour you can hear the pummeling of a
[1:04:53] heavy rain shower on the roof of your
[1:04:56] house but the opposite of dew dew is
[1:04:59] silent doesn't make a noise there's no
[1:05:03] grand entry there's no earth-shattering
[1:05:06] sound you don't you don't pop your eyes
[1:05:08] open at 6:00 a.m. and go all the dew I
[1:05:11] can hear it no you just snore right
[1:05:15] through it it's silent I'm gonna bring
[1:05:19] this to something here in a minute it's
[1:05:21] silent it doesn't draw any attention to
[1:05:24] itself you can look at it is there's
[1:05:27] there's a humility to it it's unassuming
[1:05:30] but its moisture it's the same exact
[1:05:33] thing as rain it's the same exact it's
[1:05:37] water it's moisture its watering the
[1:05:39] earth but you know what it doesn't do it
[1:05:41] never causes damage it's gentle it's
[1:05:46] nourishing and it's dependable that that
[1:05:52] is an exact type of the mercy of God the
[1:05:58] mercy that Jeremiah says is new every
[1:06:02] morning it's dependable it's it's always
[1:06:06] it goes unnoticed and in order for you
[1:06:09] to ever see the dew you've got to make
[1:06:11] an intention you've got to go outside
[1:06:13] and and and look at that but it's it's
[1:06:15] it's as much a gift of God as rain as
[1:06:18] they as they pray the the Jews will pray
[1:06:21] they live in two seasons they don't have
[1:06:23] multiple seasons like we have here we
[1:06:25] don't really have multiple seasons even
[1:06:27] here in South Carolina and Buford but
[1:06:29] they live in the dry season and they
[1:06:31] live in the wet season that's it one or
[1:06:33] the other it's two extremes much like
[1:06:35] even the Arizona desert it's either
[1:06:36] really dry with you this most of the
[1:06:38] time and then they got the monsoon and
[1:06:40] it's really wet and it's and it's a
[1:06:42] torrential downpour there's no
[1:06:43] in-between but it's it's
[1:06:46] this it's it's as much a gift as rain is
[1:06:50] in a dry season and it's and and and you
[1:06:54] notice this here even even in a another
[1:06:57] scripture here if you go to the next
[1:06:58] slide I'm not sure what I have brother
[1:06:59] if you can advance that Gideon says that
[1:07:02] people this is Genesis 27 says that
[1:07:05] people shall be willing in the day of
[1:07:07] thy power and the beauties of holiness
[1:07:09] from the womb of the morning so it's a
[1:07:11] it's a it's it's speaking up here from
[1:07:13] the beginning and he says thou has the
[1:07:16] dew of Veit youth go to the next slide
[1:07:19] if you can keep going here okay yeah you
[1:07:24] can you can pause it right there so it's
[1:07:26] it's a powerful thing here let me come
[1:07:28] back to my notes here just for a minute
[1:07:30] here's another scripture in Genesis 27
[1:07:32] this is a blessing Isaac blesses Jacob
[1:07:36] with and he says may God give you of the
[1:07:38] dew of heaven and of the fatness of the
[1:07:41] earth and the plenty of grain and wine
[1:07:44] so it's it's a blessing and so much that
[1:07:47] he used it with grain and wine and he
[1:07:50] says may give you of the dew of the
[1:07:53] heaven so it's a it's a it's exactly
[1:07:58] what the Bible says it's exactly it's a
[1:08:00] refreshing it's the same thing that God
[1:08:02] gave the children of Israel under Moses
[1:08:05] with manna in the morning and and quell
[1:08:08] in the evening this is this is what it's
[1:08:11] typed with it's a source of life it's a
[1:08:14] source of life what's amazing about this
[1:08:17] even when you look at this this this
[1:08:19] thing with Dew and the morning is that
[1:08:22] the Jews would pray for the first do
[1:08:25] because it was important for them it
[1:08:27] spoke of that they were going to come
[1:08:29] out of the dry season and then we're
[1:08:32] gonna enter the moist season and it's a
[1:08:34] as we said it's a it's a prayer of
[1:08:37] blessing that they pray and it's it's
[1:08:40] something that they that they asked for
[1:08:42] to the Lord but what's amazing is when
[1:08:44] you look at this morning forgive me here
[1:08:46] for this being a little bit disorganized
[1:08:48] here on my notes I want to make sure
[1:08:49] don't get ahead of myself here but it's
[1:08:51] amazing because when you look at morning
[1:08:55] and if you go to the next this this
[1:08:57] slide right here
[1:08:58] in Psalms 5 go back 1 and psalms 5 want
[1:09:01] to make sure we catch that one he says
[1:09:03] my voice shall hear my voice shall doubt
[1:09:06] here in the morning this is David my
[1:09:10] voice shalt thou hear in the morning O
[1:09:13] Lord in the morning will I direct my
[1:09:16] prayer unto thee and I will look up go
[1:09:22] to the next one if you could he says it
[1:09:24] is of the Lord's mercies they are new
[1:09:26] every morning don't go advance that a
[1:09:28] little bit just again beginning for his
[1:09:31] anger and dureth for a moment here it is
[1:09:33] in his favour his life we've been may
[1:09:36] endure for a night but joy comes in the
[1:09:43] morning so it's a season as David said
[1:09:47] there's a season of night of mourning
[1:09:49] but then there's a season coming of joy
[1:09:52] in the morning and keep going and I'm
[1:09:56] not sure I want to make sure we catch
[1:09:57] all these but I will sing of thy power
[1:09:59] this is David again yay I will sing
[1:10:01] aloud of thy mercy in the morning for
[1:10:04] thou has been my defence and refuge and
[1:10:07] the day of my trouble go to the next
[1:10:09] slide do we have any more calls me to
[1:10:12] hear thy loving-kindness in the morning
[1:10:15] for indeed do I trust calls me to know
[1:10:18] thy way where and I should walk for a
[1:10:19] lift my soul unto thee and he says this
[1:10:25] is the day which the Lord has made this
[1:10:28] is what David is saying today this
[1:10:30] morning not yesterday not what happened
[1:10:33] yesterday but right now today is the day
[1:10:37] the Lord has made I will rejoice and be
[1:10:41] glad in it so it's the it's thing is we
[1:10:44] says we register minute ago the womb of
[1:10:46] the morning the beginning of the morning
[1:10:47] the breaking of a new day it speaks of
[1:10:50] the freshness the strength of the early
[1:10:53] stages of the day because it's a new
[1:10:56] start
[1:10:56] it's it should be and it's an
[1:10:58] encouragement that God can can can can
[1:11:02] can revive what is what needs to be
[1:11:05] revived he can give strength to that
[1:11:07] which is weak and it's it's a powerful
[1:11:11] thing be
[1:11:11] because when you think of this here just
[1:11:14] for a moment is the last time we spoke
[1:11:16] one of the last time we spoke we spoke a
[1:11:18] lot on the life of Samson in the life of
[1:11:21] Jacob and two very powerful characters
[1:11:25] that we're not going to parallel again
[1:11:26] here tonight but I I just began to read
[1:11:29] this here again because I thought about
[1:11:31] how much failure that they had a they
[1:11:35] had experienced in their own life
[1:11:37] we ended if you were I don't know if you
[1:11:39] remember I was recap here for a moment
[1:11:41] we ended with Samson grinding in the
[1:11:44] prison house and he had missed
[1:11:47] completely missed his destiny and his
[1:11:49] life was just a wreck complete just just
[1:11:52] just a sad story of what could have been
[1:11:56] Jacob very much the same way with Deena
[1:11:58] and then the Lord begins to call to
[1:12:00] Jacob and says go back to Bethel it was
[1:12:03] it was God addressing his son who had
[1:12:07] failed it was God addressing Jacob who
[1:12:10] had just made a mess out of things and
[1:12:13] and God just begins there at the very in
[1:12:16] and he says Jacob go back to Bethel and
[1:12:19] you remember God doesn't address him in
[1:12:23] some chastising way he doesn't rebuke
[1:12:26] him he doesn't lash out at him he just
[1:12:29] gives him the very simple invitation
[1:12:32] come back to Bethel Jacob it's a it's
[1:12:34] what is it it's it's very different than
[1:12:37] how we react to others who have felt us
[1:12:41] others who've led us down God react it
[1:12:45] reacts with such mercy to his servant
[1:12:48] they he doesn't even discuss it I
[1:12:50] thought it was so powerful you don't
[1:12:52] record no record of Scripture of God or
[1:12:55] a prophet coming to him or trying to
[1:12:57] trying to rebuke him or trying to tell
[1:12:59] him how how bad he messed up but godness
[1:13:02] says listen Jacob just forget about what
[1:13:05] happened and just move on past it you
[1:13:08] can't live in yesterday Jacob you've got
[1:13:11] to come back to Bethel and you remember
[1:13:14] that God says I'm he says I'm bound to
[1:13:17] you I'm tied to you all wherever you go
[1:13:19] I'll go
[1:13:20] and he says that I'll never leave you or
[1:13:22] never forsake you it was God saying
[1:13:23] forget about what happened yesterday
[1:13:25] because I promise you no matter what way
[1:13:30] or what capacity you may have failed God
[1:13:34] God was aware that you were going to
[1:13:37] fail him before you failed him and God
[1:13:40] knew the inadequacy that was in Sampson
[1:13:43] before Sampson messed up thought it was
[1:13:47] powerful in judges chapter 27 you'll
[1:13:49] read this are judges chapter 16 you'll
[1:13:52] read the same exact thing when the Bible
[1:13:54] says in verse 22 it says in verse 21 the
[1:13:57] Philistines took him put out his eyes
[1:13:59] brought him down to Gaza and bound him
[1:14:02] with fetters of brass ha and he says and
[1:14:05] he did grind in the prison house and
[1:14:07] then in verse 22 that comes out of
[1:14:09] nowhere
[1:14:10] howbeit the hair of his head began to
[1:14:12] grow again out of you a shave
[1:14:14] it's just like immediately what was it
[1:14:17] it was mourning mercy
[1:14:20] it was another chance it wasn't a God
[1:14:23] who was just going to say you know what
[1:14:25] Samson man I'm your room the word is
[1:14:27] done you're gonna separate you find
[1:14:30] somebody else but God is saying you're
[1:14:32] the Mercy's new every morning can't
[1:14:35] dwell in yesterday here's another chance
[1:14:37] what was that representative of a shaven
[1:14:40] head howbeit the hair of his head began
[1:14:44] to grow maybe ever so small maybe no one
[1:14:46] could see it but God but the hair of his
[1:14:49] head began to grow again
[1:14:50] it was the mercy of God saying no matter
[1:14:53] how how bad you've messed up how bad
[1:14:56] you've jumbled this up you have to make
[1:14:59] a choice in your life of how you're
[1:15:03] going to react or how you're going to
[1:15:05] move forward from this point because you
[1:15:09] can either stay stuck in yesterday or
[1:15:12] you can receive the dew of this morning
[1:15:16] it's an amazing thing I actually heard
[1:15:19] another minister speaking about this and
[1:15:21] he made some references to this plant
[1:15:24] and I just begin to look it up it became
[1:15:26] an interest to me Rachael is becoming a
[1:15:29] quite the colour the plant lady and
[1:15:31] she's got plants everywhere and she's
[1:15:33] got a real
[1:15:34] really good it's got a green thumb and
[1:15:36] she does he loves she loves plants and
[1:15:39] loves she's you know she's doing it
[1:15:41] almost looks like a chemistry project
[1:15:43] sometimes with some some of the things
[1:15:45] she's doing with plants and it's amazing
[1:15:47] study when you look at this it's it's it
[1:15:50] went that of what makes a plant grow and
[1:15:53] we know that there's many things that
[1:15:55] make a plant grow you have the Sun and
[1:15:57] you have the light and you have water
[1:15:59] you have all the components but there's
[1:16:01] something I'm not a botanist but there's
[1:16:03] something you can study called a
[1:16:05] meristem line and it's pretty powerful
[1:16:08] when you look at it because it's it's
[1:16:10] the science it's the part of science
[1:16:13] that's real that science can't figure
[1:16:16] out make this the same thing they can't
[1:16:19] figure out how SAP in a tree during the
[1:16:22] season of winter leaves the tree and
[1:16:24] goes into the root system they know what
[1:16:26] happens but what voice tells that SAP
[1:16:29] and the trick is if the SAP stays in the
[1:16:31] tree and the winter comes the tree will
[1:16:33] die but there's an intelligent life
[1:16:36] inside of that tree to tell that tree
[1:16:39] wintertime is coming so the SAP leaves
[1:16:43] the tree goes down into the roots to
[1:16:45] preserve the life of that tree and it's
[1:16:49] amazing because it's a part that science
[1:16:51] hasn't figured out but they know that it
[1:16:53] happens it's an intelligent life there's
[1:16:55] something that's brother branham uses
[1:16:56] that example with the infidel who he's
[1:16:59] speaking to and you remember he tells
[1:17:01] he's he starts you know talking about
[1:17:03] the one talking about you know to this
[1:17:05] infidel he's hunting the property and
[1:17:06] the infidel says you know he tells him
[1:17:08] about a you know he asks him about he
[1:17:11] says oh you're an infidel or he says yes
[1:17:12] sir and and brother Branham says well it
[1:17:15] and he begins to figure out how the
[1:17:17] exactly the conversation begins but
[1:17:19] brother Manning begins to start talking
[1:17:21] him about nature and he says you see
[1:17:22] that bucket over on that tree and he
[1:17:25] says you know what the SAP that's inside
[1:17:27] of that tree dripping from the tree down
[1:17:28] into the bucket NER area gives me he
[1:17:31] gives the example of the of a of the SAP
[1:17:33] and the tree that's what it was and
[1:17:35] brother man and says he says what
[1:17:36] there's a voice inside of that tree that
[1:17:38] tells the SAP to go back into the ground
[1:17:41] and he says and then there's a then
[1:17:44] there's
[1:17:44] you know when springtime comes that
[1:17:47] voice tells that SAP to come up out of
[1:17:49] the tree and he says and go back and
[1:17:52] come out of the roots and go back up
[1:17:54] into the tree and brother branham begins
[1:17:56] to tell him he begins to tell him about
[1:17:58] this woman that was healed and made up
[1:18:00] said she made a terrible ruckus he was
[1:18:02] shouting and praising God I said healed
[1:18:03] of some disease and he says and brother
[1:18:05] Branham begins to say and he doesn't
[1:18:07] realize he's speaking to brother Branham
[1:18:08] who's the man in the meeting he says
[1:18:10] some man and the meet he says I'd like
[1:18:11] to meet him someday he says that man who
[1:18:14] told that woman she was going to get
[1:18:15] well and he had no idea there he was
[1:18:19] speaking to the man I'm speaking to the
[1:18:20] Prophet himself and he says told him
[1:18:23] some voice he says some voice told say
[1:18:26] he said some voice told that preacher to
[1:18:28] tell that woman she was going to get
[1:18:29] well - brother Branham says well he says
[1:18:31] the same voice that tells that SAP in
[1:18:34] the tree to come up out of the ground of
[1:18:35] the same voice that told me to tell that
[1:18:37] woman she was gonna get well brother man
[1:18:40] said just with a little thing like that
[1:18:41] I'll let him to the Lord because he
[1:18:44] could see the law of nature he could see
[1:18:46] the law of life it's amazing because
[1:18:49] there's something in a tree or something
[1:18:51] in a plant in every plant whether it's a
[1:18:53] flower tree and it's something called a
[1:18:56] meristem line and it's and if you ever
[1:18:59] cut even at the base of a tree it's
[1:19:01] where it goes into the ground you ever
[1:19:03] cut it off you can find that meristem
[1:19:05] line it's it's it and we know that at
[1:19:08] the bait the base the root system is
[1:19:10] where that tree receives its nutrients
[1:19:12] and you know what's amazing about it is
[1:19:15] is that a tree in the wild or a flower
[1:19:17] in the wild it doesn't get to pick how
[1:19:20] much sunlight it gets it doesn't get to
[1:19:22] choose the weather that it receives it
[1:19:26] doesn't get to ask what nutrients it's
[1:19:28] going to receive it just receives
[1:19:30] whatever it's given it receives it at
[1:19:34] the base and the ground it receives
[1:19:36] those nutrients and then science tells
[1:19:39] us that it divides those nutrients out
[1:19:41] in two ways some of the nutrients it
[1:19:45] pushes down and some of the nutrients it
[1:19:48] pushes up and some of those nutrients
[1:19:50] that divides it into roots into root
[1:19:52] systems than others it divides it into
[1:19:54] to go up into fruit
[1:19:56] into leaves and it's an amazing because
[1:19:59] if you look at it well enough you can
[1:20:02] see it it looks like a little knot I've
[1:20:05] seen pictures you can google it it looks
[1:20:07] just to wear it it's a different maybe
[1:20:08] that it's different with the based on
[1:20:10] the you know a different color maybe
[1:20:12] based on the tree if you were to cut the
[1:20:14] tree down and you were to look at the
[1:20:16] bark you'd see this little different
[1:20:18] it's almost an odd colored line that
[1:20:21] starts at the tree and it's it's almost
[1:20:23] like the DNA of a plant you have a plant
[1:20:27] or a tree or a flower it's like the DNA
[1:20:29] just stay with me here for just for a
[1:20:31] moment but what's amazing is that
[1:20:33] science says this line is where that
[1:20:37] tree or that plant or that flower makes
[1:20:41] a decision in that spot and it makes a
[1:20:46] choice of what to do with the nutrients
[1:20:51] or the atmosphere or the rain that it's
[1:20:55] receiving and it makes a choice it's
[1:20:58] it's a spot the where that that
[1:20:59] intelligence of that plant it determines
[1:21:02] what I'm going to use this for and a lot
[1:21:05] of times a plant will at that meristem
[1:21:08] line the reason that a tree will die is
[1:21:11] because it used what it received for it
[1:21:14] didn't use it for life and yeah it
[1:21:16] didn't use it to grow up but it actually
[1:21:19] used it to stunt its growth and grow
[1:21:21] down and the tree eventually dies and it
[1:21:24] happens at a meristem line it makes a
[1:21:28] choice to go high or decision to go low
[1:21:34] now
[1:21:35] pause that for a moment it's almost
[1:21:37] exactly what happens in your body at not
[1:21:41] the meristem but the stem cell line
[1:21:43] because in your body the body makes
[1:21:47] decisions from the cells and the
[1:21:50] nutrients it's receiving your body
[1:21:53] chooses what to do with those nutrients
[1:21:56] it receives now you choose unlike a
[1:21:59] plant you choose what you put in your
[1:22:01] body you choose what you drink you
[1:22:03] choose what you eat but that plant has
[1:22:05] no decision in and it just receives
[1:22:08] and the body makes decisions from the
[1:22:11] cells and the nutrients that it's
[1:22:12] receiving from a baby from its mother
[1:22:15] the life of that mother there's
[1:22:17] nutrients coming in the infant's body
[1:22:19] and at a stem cell line that little
[1:22:22] fetus that little life makes a decision
[1:22:25] to use those nutrients it's drawing on
[1:22:28] to make a finger to make an eyeball to
[1:22:30] make hair to make feet to make legs it's
[1:22:34] a it to make a heart to make organs and
[1:22:37] it's at that's very it's almost directly
[1:22:39] parallel with the meristem line of the
[1:22:41] plant it makes a choice to take a cell
[1:22:44] and say I'm going to use you for a good
[1:22:47] sale and you're going to be used for a
[1:22:49] good purpose and I'm gonna use it to
[1:22:51] grow the body are you with me but what
[1:22:55] they say is what causes cancer is
[1:23:00] unidentified cells things that the body
[1:23:04] never does anything with and they become
[1:23:08] almost like foreign they're aliens and
[1:23:11] then they can become dangerous because a
[1:23:14] cell that never gets identified can
[1:23:17] become cancer it's unidentified can
[1:23:19] multiply into bad cells now notice this
[1:23:23] here it's not necessarily what's coming
[1:23:26] in but it's what the body chooses to do
[1:23:30] with what's coming in are you following
[1:23:34] me
[1:23:35] it's how it decides the body makes a
[1:23:38] choice what am I going to do with what I
[1:23:41] have received how am I going to handle
[1:23:45] it it's not what comes in that causes
[1:23:48] the cancer it's how the body acts to
[1:23:51] what's coming in its how they handle it
[1:23:53] it's that it gets sent to the wrong
[1:23:56] place and those cells become dangerous
[1:23:58] used to create cancer it's how the body
[1:24:01] handles what it's been given it's
[1:24:05] exactly how the plant determines or
[1:24:08] decides how it's going to use what it's
[1:24:13] received and a plant has no choice in
[1:24:18] the nutrients it receives and
[1:24:21] no decision but here's the decision it
[1:24:23] can make how am I going to use what I've
[1:24:27] got how am I go what am I going to do
[1:24:31] I've got a choice to make I can decide I
[1:24:34] can't always choose what bad things
[1:24:37] happen to me in my life I can't always
[1:24:40] choose I don't get to pick I don't know
[1:24:42] about you but I don't have a I don't
[1:24:44] text God every morning in heaven he
[1:24:46] doesn't give me a multiple choice and
[1:24:47] here's four trials I can send you
[1:24:49] through now you pick which one you want
[1:24:51] to go through maybe you all have that
[1:24:53] conversation but I don't I don't choose
[1:24:57] what trial I'm going to go through I
[1:24:58] don't choose what circumstance I'm going
[1:25:00] to face what difficulty I'm going to
[1:25:02] face what problem I'm going to go
[1:25:04] through as Suliman says life is made up
[1:25:06] of seasons a time of more and a time to
[1:25:08] laugh a time to dance a time to cry time
[1:25:10] to receive a time to get time to lose
[1:25:12] time to build up time to tear down and
[1:25:15] you don't choose all the seasons of your
[1:25:17] life but you have the choice are you
[1:25:21] here and how you're going to react to
[1:25:25] what you've been given the plant makes a
[1:25:29] decision I'm either going to take what
[1:25:32] I've been given and allow it to cause me
[1:25:35] to go down or I'm going to take what
[1:25:38] I've been given and I'm gonna allow it
[1:25:40] to bring me higher and it makes are you
[1:25:44] here tonight Church it makes that
[1:25:47] decision at the meristem line that
[1:25:50] decision and the body is made at the
[1:25:53] stem cell line it's a powerful thing the
[1:25:56] minister pointed out in 2nd Corinthians
[1:25:58] chapter 2 verse 16 turned there if you
[1:26:00] have you at home in Scripture 2nd
[1:26:02] Corinthians chapter 2 verse 16 or
[1:26:04] something this is so amazing
[1:26:06] 2nd Corinthians 2 look what he says he
[1:26:11] says this is this is the gospel look we
[1:26:13] have it on the screen here so you can
[1:26:14] save time the Bible says that to the one
[1:26:17] we are the savour of death now this is
[1:26:21] Paul this is his ministry this is the
[1:26:23] gospel this is the cross to one it is
[1:26:26] the savour of death unto
[1:26:28] of death unto death and to the other the
[1:26:31] savour of life unto life so what is the
[1:26:35] Bible saying that the same gospel that
[1:26:38] saves one damns another the same gospel
[1:26:42] that creates life in one person actually
[1:26:46] creates death in another person imagine
[1:26:49] if you just think about that it's a
[1:26:50] powerful thought that this the preaching
[1:26:53] of Christ Paul says is foolishness to
[1:26:56] some of the world but it's life unto
[1:26:58] others the same message that you believe
[1:27:01] gives you joy it brings bitterness and
[1:27:04] hatred to other parts of the world the
[1:27:07] same message the same voice of a prophet
[1:27:09] that you turn on that gives you peace in
[1:27:11] your life brings hatred to other people
[1:27:15] and Paul says two to one its life to the
[1:27:19] other it is death in in other words some
[1:27:22] people can hear the message are hear
[1:27:24] that the sermon and can ear the
[1:27:26] preaching of the word and and some
[1:27:28] people can take in that use that message
[1:27:31] or that inspiration and they literally
[1:27:33] receive life it brings life to their
[1:27:36] family it brings joy to their marriage
[1:27:38] it brings salvation to their children it
[1:27:40] brings life in their brains it brings
[1:27:42] encouragement when they're discouraged
[1:27:44] and they could use that message that
[1:27:47] gospel that truth to make them to grow
[1:27:50] strong in the Lord and there's some
[1:27:52] people who hear the same preaching the
[1:27:55] same gospel the same message and it does
[1:27:59] nothing for them it does nothing for
[1:28:05] them your the message of the hours to
[1:28:07] here at 8 is nothing but to me it's it
[1:28:10] does so much because of that decision
[1:28:14] that brother madam said what is in the
[1:28:15] soy says that's where you make your
[1:28:17] choice that meristem line that stem cell
[1:28:21] line will you you choose what what
[1:28:24] you're going to do with what you receive
[1:28:28] that's why you can have a church just
[1:28:31] like a garden and they could hear the
[1:28:33] preaching of the word and some are
[1:28:34] growing and some are dying or let me say
[1:28:37] it this way some are growing and some
[1:28:38] are staying in the same exact spot
[1:28:40] they've always been
[1:28:41] it's not the preachers fault it's not
[1:28:42] the messages fault it's not the Holy
[1:28:44] Ghost Holy Spirit's fault
[1:28:46] it's it's you who make the decision on
[1:28:49] what are you going to do with what you
[1:28:52] receive you can take a person who goes
[1:28:57] through a horrible situation you watch
[1:28:58] two families amazing you watch two
[1:29:01] families go through the exact same
[1:29:02] tragic event and one of them gets bitter
[1:29:05] and one of them gets better from yeah
[1:29:07] you take a horrible thing that happens
[1:29:09] to one person and it's life it's it's a
[1:29:12] it's growth for one it's death for the
[1:29:14] other now they went through the same
[1:29:17] exact thing you take the loss of a child
[1:29:19] one family loses a baby and another
[1:29:22] family loses a baby but their reactions
[1:29:24] are totally separate one of them maybe
[1:29:26] get bitter and leave the church and turn
[1:29:28] their back on God one may grow stronger
[1:29:31] in the Lord yeah are you are you hearing
[1:29:34] me tonight you see it's not in in what
[1:29:39] it's it's not it's not in what we
[1:29:42] receive you can receive some bad things
[1:29:44] in your life it's how are you going to
[1:29:47] react to what you've been given it's not
[1:29:52] let me go further than that it's not in
[1:29:54] how bad your brother man I felt so bad
[1:29:56] that's not the failure is not what
[1:29:59] defines you it's how you react to that
[1:30:01] failure it's what are you going to do
[1:30:04] everybody makes mistakes everybody
[1:30:07] messes up everybody can sit here and and
[1:30:10] give a sob story of how they missed the
[1:30:12] will of God or how they miss this chance
[1:30:14] this opportunity they have but what are
[1:30:16] you going to do now how are you going to
[1:30:20] react to it now are you going to get
[1:30:22] better or are you going to get better
[1:30:25] are you going to go down or are you
[1:30:28] going to use what life has given you to
[1:30:30] go up it's all according to your choice
[1:30:35] you can choose everything listen to me
[1:30:38] my brother my sister you don't as we
[1:30:40] said you don't choose what happens in
[1:30:42] your life it's not what happens in other
[1:30:45] words it's not what happens to me it's
[1:30:47] what happens in me because inside of me
[1:30:50] I get to make a choice on what I'm going
[1:30:52] to do with what I've been given and you
[1:30:54] know your you're gonna get you don't get
[1:30:56] to choose that this storms are the
[1:30:58] trials of the test that you go through
[1:31:00] but let me say this to you you can make
[1:31:02] a choice to either allow that difficulty
[1:31:06] to take you up or to take you down this
[1:31:12] is what happens to that plant at that
[1:31:15] meristem line it either goes it takes
[1:31:17] what it's received the nutrients it
[1:31:19] receives the life that it's been given
[1:31:21] the sunshine er the clouds or the rain
[1:31:23] or the the hurricane or whatever it is
[1:31:26] and it makes a choice what am I going to
[1:31:29] use what if it's not whether what I
[1:31:31] receive or what I don't receive it's
[1:31:33] what I'm doing with what God has given
[1:31:37] me you've heard it before the problems
[1:31:40] in life are gonna come but it's our
[1:31:41] attitude and how we face difficult I
[1:31:44] know that simple but it's what the Lord
[1:31:46] gave me it's our attitude and how we
[1:31:49] will it will either be will either
[1:31:52] recognize the do in the morning or will
[1:31:55] this sleep right through it because the
[1:31:59] mercy is new every morning but you've
[1:32:01] got to make use of that mercy you've got
[1:32:04] to use that morning mercy that mercy in
[1:32:06] the morning and say I'm going to use it
[1:32:08] just to thank God for it and as Paul
[1:32:11] said forget what's in the past forget
[1:32:14] what happened yesterday forget about it
[1:32:17] and press towards the mark of the high
[1:32:19] calling in Christ Jesus what are you
[1:32:23] gonna do with what life has given you no
[1:32:25] matter what it is and what season in
[1:32:27] your life what would no matter what
[1:32:29] comes your way or what since your way
[1:32:31] you'll either choose let me say they see
[1:32:33] my brother my sister you're gonna have a
[1:32:35] million chances you're gonna have a
[1:32:37] million opportunities to get bitter in
[1:32:40] life you're gonna have a million
[1:32:42] opportunities to get depressed in life
[1:32:44] you're gonna have a thousand chances to
[1:32:46] let someone hurt your feelings or
[1:32:48] someone to do you wrong or some
[1:32:49] injustice to happen to you you're going
[1:32:52] to have a thousand opportunities to
[1:32:54] allow those things
[1:32:55] happened to you to become bitter or
[1:32:57] someone to hurt you and for you to get
[1:33:00] cynical or you to get under our for you
[1:33:02] to get negative and you can allow that
[1:33:05] root of bitterness to grow inside your
[1:33:07] heart and and I think it's James who
[1:33:12] says that root of bitterness he says
[1:33:13] when it defiles you it doesn't just
[1:33:15] defile the person it defiles everything
[1:33:17] around them you'll have a hundred
[1:33:22] thousand chances to get bitter in life
[1:33:25] somebody will hurt you say something
[1:33:27] that they shouldn't have said it's the
[1:33:28] church will do you wrong somebody will
[1:33:29] do you wrong let me say this you're
[1:33:31] gonna have a million disappointments
[1:33:34] you're gonna have millions of
[1:33:36] opportunities of how am I going to react
[1:33:38] to those disappointments in life you can
[1:33:42] make a decision I'm either going to let
[1:33:45] this take me down into a root of
[1:33:46] bitterness I'm gonna push up the fruits
[1:33:49] of the spirit I'm either going to allow
[1:33:53] it to make me bitter or make me better
[1:33:57] it can take you down or it can take you
[1:34:02] up we decide what we're going to do with
[1:34:07] what we've been given
[1:34:09] and as Solomon says life is full of
[1:34:12] seasons it's it's it's full of of times
[1:34:15] as Solomon says that everything there's
[1:34:17] a season a season to be born to see a
[1:34:20] time to die a time to plant time to
[1:34:23] pluck up that which is planted time to
[1:34:25] build up time to tear down and he says
[1:34:27] there's going to be seasons that you go
[1:34:29] through and there's going to be even let
[1:34:31] me say this there's going to be seasons
[1:34:33] of disappointment there's going to be
[1:34:36] times that you fell God in your life too
[1:34:40] many times where you fall on your face
[1:34:42] as a son of God as a daughter of God
[1:34:46] born of the Spirit of God there's going
[1:34:48] to be difficulties you have in your
[1:34:50] marriage there's going on know some of
[1:34:52] y'all newlyweds don't want to hear that
[1:34:54] but they're gonna be difficulties can
[1:34:57] some of us veterans I'm not a veteran
[1:35:01] say there's gonna be difficulties
[1:35:03] there's gonna be struggles but you
[1:35:06] notice it's it's not it's one family
[1:35:08] that breaks off in divorce and one
[1:35:10] family that's 50 years down the road
[1:35:11] still together they both went through
[1:35:13] the same what life had been given them
[1:35:16] it's just they chose to do something
[1:35:18] inside of them differently they both
[1:35:22] received the same nutrients but one of
[1:35:24] them use those to cause them to go down
[1:35:27] and one of them use them to cause them
[1:35:29] to push up
[1:35:31] you're gonna go through tests you're
[1:35:33] gonna go through trials yes Samson
[1:35:35] daddy's gonna fail God but what he had
[1:35:37] to recognize is that his hair had begin
[1:35:40] to grow again what Jacob had to begin to
[1:35:42] realize is that whether he realized that
[1:35:45] or not mercy was new that morning he
[1:35:48] could have ignored it you might have
[1:35:50] ignored it you might be ignoring it
[1:35:51] today but the mercy of God is for you
[1:35:54] and it's never gonna give up on you it's
[1:35:57] never gonna quit on you it's never gonna
[1:35:58] stop on you it's never gonna get loose
[1:36:01] faith in you God is never gonna lose
[1:36:03] faith in me
[1:36:04] he's never gonna lose faith in you you
[1:36:06] may lose faith in yourself but God will
[1:36:08] never lose faith in you
[1:36:10] you know what God's gonna do God's just
[1:36:12] gonna keep on encouraging you he's gonna
[1:36:14] keep on preaching to you he's gonna keep
[1:36:16] on telling you you can make it just get
[1:36:18] back up again you might have messed up
[1:36:20] you might have made every mistake in the
[1:36:22] world but I'm not gonna quit I'm not
[1:36:24] gonna stop I'm gonna keep giving it to
[1:36:26] you until you can receive it with faith
[1:36:32] and say Lord I'm going to overcome it
[1:36:34] God said I'm it doesn't matter how many
[1:36:36] times you walk away doesn't matter how
[1:36:38] many times you know you hear a sermon
[1:36:39] God sends it gets an anointed sermons
[1:36:43] I'm knowing an inspiration and it deals
[1:36:45] directly with a situation and just
[1:36:48] directly like a bull's-eye like a laser
[1:36:50] but how many times we walk away and goes
[1:36:53] right over and what we go through the
[1:36:57] same exact road and the same exact
[1:36:58] problem the same exact issue and we just
[1:37:00] keep repeating and they keep repeating
[1:37:01] and they keep repeating you know what
[1:37:03] you thank God one day we'll just go you
[1:37:05] know what fine that's enough that's it
[1:37:07] that's all
[1:37:09] that's enough I'm done told you how many
[1:37:12] times now that was uh that was the 33rd
[1:37:14] time I had that preacher say that in his
[1:37:16] sermon and you are still questioning the
[1:37:20] same exact thing in your life you're
[1:37:23] still allowing bitterness to come in
[1:37:25] your life you're still Allah you
[1:37:26] steelers are bound by that after 39
[1:37:29] times that's been said under the

[1:41:51] David's prayed this prayer and he says
[1:41:53] he started to look at the frailty and
[1:41:55] the how fragile life was he started to
[1:41:58] look at how the how life could just be
[1:42:01] it could end just overnight and David
[1:42:03] realizes that and he realized he's just
[1:42:05] been going through the hustle and the
[1:42:07] bustle of life and David stops and says
[1:42:10] he says so teach us to number our days

[2:00:37] Cherokee North Carolina sent in books
[2:00:39] and everything well after Andy passed
[2:00:43] away it become harder and I prayed and I
[2:00:46] said lord if they ever have an outreach
[2:00:47] please let me go
[2:00:49] well because of Christopher and Katie I
[2:00:52] got to go last year they had an outreach
[2:00:54] but anyway I wrote some that absolutely
[2:00:59] loved it this one girl a woman she had
[2:01:02] children
[2:01:04] me and her started corresponding and I'd
[2:01:07] sent her books it's absolutely loved on
[2:01:09] the senator tapes and everything in 2011
[2:01:14] 2012 2013 lost track
[2:01:19] and I just I kind of got discouraged I
[2:01:24] said well Lord I really really had my
[2:01:27] heart set on some work being up there
[2:01:29] but if it ever comes I I don't don't
[2:01:32] guess I'll be around
[2:01:34] unless Christopher Texas again you know
[2:01:36] or something but anyway I had sent out
[2:01:39] three letters just recently and one of
[2:01:43] those to her I didn't still live the
[2:01:45] same place or anything and I said Lord
[2:01:48] you said cast your bread upon the water
[2:01:50] after many days I've come back so I
[2:01:53] actually prayed I said Lord I'm kind of
[2:01:56] sad about it it seemed like it's never
[2:01:59] come back
[2:02:00] it'll come back whether I'm here or
[2:02:02] there it's from back last week I've got
[2:02:05] a letter from her after seven years
[2:02:08] right guard begging for books I sent her
[2:02:10] a whole pack so y'all pray for anybody
[2:02:20] else sister joy I just want to thank God
[2:02:27] for this new job I got so we were
[2:02:29] praying for probably this entire school
[2:02:32] year that I would find something other
[2:02:34] than teaching and when Kove it happened
[2:02:36] I was like well no one's gonna be hiring
[2:02:38] for any job and I wasn't really sure you
[2:02:41] know what I wanted to do anyways so I
[2:02:44] just signed my teaching contract and I
[2:02:46] was pretty comfortable with going back
[2:02:47] for the next school year and then
[2:02:49] probably like a month later Hannah
[2:02:51] called me and she was like we're
[2:02:53] actually looking for an assistant at my
[2:02:56] work and she works for this mortgage
[2:02:58] company and she was like it's a
[2:03:00] part-time job
[2:03:00] and I told her like oh thanks but I
[2:03:03] really need a full-time job so I just
[2:03:06] kind of forgot about it and then a week
[2:03:07] later she calls me back and she's like
[2:03:09] well we're gonna do up to the regional
[2:03:11] manager about making it into a full-time
[2:03:12] position so we can pay you more and I
[2:03:15] was like well okay then
[2:03:16] and so she's like I'll just get back to
[2:03:19] you and I said you know what he says so
[2:03:21] in the meantime I'm like talking to
[2:03:24] Caleb he was like well you know we've

[2:03:38] calls me back and she's like yeah we're
[2:03:39] gonna make it into a full-time position
