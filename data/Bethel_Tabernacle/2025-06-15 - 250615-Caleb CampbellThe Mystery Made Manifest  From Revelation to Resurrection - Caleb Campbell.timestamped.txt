[1:39] your spirit. Father, you are our father.

[1:46] pray that you'll bless your people
[1:47] today, Lord.
[1:49] Help us, Father, to
[1:52] honor you and worship you.
[1:55] You deserve it all, Lord. We thank you
[1:57] for what you've done for us. As we
[1:59] collect the tithes and offerings, we
[2:00] pray that you bless the cheerful giver.
[2:04] Father, I pray for those that are sick,
[2:06] not feeling well, whatever their
[2:08] circumstance, whatever situation they're
[2:10] in. Father,
[2:13] as a child, I just lift up the name of
[2:15] Jesus Christ to you for their healing,
[2:18] for their comfort, for their strength.
[2:20] Touch their bodies, touch their hearts,
[2:24] touch their minds, Lord. Fill us again
[2:27] and again with thy Holy Spirit. In

[37:37] take lightly. uh standing here before
[37:40] his people and bringing the word,
[37:41] preaching the gospel. You know, even
[37:43] though I always, I'm sure all of us, we
[37:45] all all get nervous and flustered and
[37:47] have a roller coaster of ups and downs
[37:49] preparing for the service, I do love
[37:51] preaching the word. Amen.
[37:53] Want to wish all the fathers out there
[37:55] happy Father's Day. Amen. God bless
[37:57] y'all. I've been incredibly blessed to
[37:59] have a a earthly father that I can
[38:02] really look up to and he's really grown
[38:04] into be one of my best friends as as an
[38:06] adult. So sure appreciate my dad and his
[38:08] influence and also my father-in-law. You
[38:10] know, I remember when Joy and I were uh
[38:13] in the beginning stages of our
[38:14] relationship and he would have quite a
[38:17] few fatherly conversations with me,
[38:20] you know, and for a time there, I I
[38:22] wasn't sure I was ever going to convince
[38:24] him that I was the guy for her.
[38:28] Um Amen. He would always tell me that he
[38:30] believed that God had somebody special
[38:32] for her. And you know, from the way he
[38:33] said it, I wasn't fully convinced. He
[38:36] wasn't fully convinced that it was me.
[38:38] Amen. But you know, I look back on those
[38:40] times and I I I greatly appreciate that.
[38:42] Amen. What I want to be for my daughter.
[38:44] So sure appreciate him. And you know,
[38:45] most importantly, we have a heavenly
[38:47] father and that's what we're here today
[38:49] for. Amen. And and to celebrate him.
[38:53] Want to remember pastor and brother Matt
[38:55] today. I think in Poland. Um brother
[38:57] Jason Demar's out of town. Anybody else?
[38:59] Um, anybody else that that might be
[39:02] traveling, uh, any visitors that might
[39:05] be here, God bless you. Good to have
[39:06] you, have you in the house of the Lord.
[39:08] Um, Brother Matt and Sister Katie, the
[39:10] newest father and his precious wife. Uh,
[39:12] we want to remember them in prayer,
[39:14] their precious little baby today. Amen.
[39:17] So, God bless you. If you have your
[39:18] Bibles, let's turn to the word.
[39:20] Appreciated the all the all the music
[39:23] and appreciated the Sunday school this
[39:24] morning. Amen.
[39:26] We're going to go to Colossians chapter
[39:28] 1. Colossians chapter 1 and verses 15
[39:34] and then we're going to read down to 29
[39:36] and then turn over into the book of
[39:37] Romans. So Colossians 1 vers 15.
[39:46] Amen. And it says, "Who is the ini the
[39:49] image of the invisible God, the
[39:51] firstborn of every creature? For by him
[39:54] were all things created that are in
[39:57] heaven and that are in earth, visible
[39:59] and invisible, whether they be thrones
[40:02] or dominions or principalities or
[40:04] powers. All things were created by him
[40:07] and for him. And he is before all
[40:10] things, and by him all things consist.
[40:13] And he is the head of the body, the
[40:15] church, who is the beginning, the
[40:17] firstborn from the dead, that in all
[40:19] things he might have the preeminence.
[40:22] For it pleased the Father that in him
[40:24] all fullness dwell. And having made
[40:28] peace through the blood of his cross by
[40:30] him to reconcile all things unto himself
[40:34] by him, I say, whether they be things in
[40:36] earth or things in heaven.
[40:39] And you that were sometime alienated and
[40:41] enemies in your mind by wicked works,
[40:45] yet now hath he reconciled, Amen. in the
[40:49] body of his flesh through death to
[40:51] present you holy and unblameable and
[40:55] unreprovable in his sight. If ye
[40:58] continue in the faith grounded and
[40:59] settled, and be not moved, away from the
[41:02] hope of the gospel which ye have heard,
[41:04] and which was preached to every creature
[41:07] which is under heaven,
[41:09] whereof I, Paul, am made a minister, who
[41:12] now rejoice in my sufferings for you,
[41:15] and fill up that which is behind of the
[41:17] afflictions of Christ in my flesh, for
[41:20] his body's sakes, for his body's sake,
[41:22] which is the church, whereof I am made a
[41:26] minister.
[41:27] according to the dispensation of God,
[41:29] which is given to me for you to fulfill
[41:31] the word of God, even the mystery which
[41:35] hath been hid from the ages and from
[41:37] generations, but now is made manifest to
[41:41] his saints, to whom would make known
[41:44] what is the riches of his of this
[41:47] mystery among the Gentiles, which is
[41:50] Christ in you, the hope of glory. Amen.
[41:53] whom we preach, warning every man, and
[41:56] teaching every man in all wisdom, that
[41:57] we may present every man perfect in
[41:59] Christ Jesus, where unto I also labor,
[42:02] striving according to his workings,
[42:05] which workketh in me mightily. If you
[42:07] turn over to Romans the 8th chapter,
[42:10] Romans chapter 8, and just the first few
[42:13] verses there down to 11,
[42:16] there is therefore now no condemnation
[42:18] to them which are in Christ Jesus, who
[42:20] walk not after the flesh, but after the
[42:21] spirit. For the law of the spirit of
[42:24] life in Christ Christ Jesus hath made me
[42:27] free from the law of sin and death. For
[42:30] what the law could not do and that it
[42:32] was weak through the flesh, God sending
[42:35] his own son in the likeness of sinful
[42:38] flesh and for sin condemned sin in the
[42:41] flesh that the righteousness of the law
[42:44] might be fulfilled in us who walk not
[42:47] after the flesh but after the spirit.
[42:50] For they that are after the flesh do
[42:53] mind the things of the flesh, but they
[42:55] that are after the spirit the things of
[42:57] the spirit. For to be carnally minded is
[43:00] death, but to be spiritually minded is
[43:03] life and peace. Because the carnal mind
[43:06] is enmity against God. For it it is not
[43:09] subject to the law of God, neither
[43:11] indeed can it be. So when they that are
[43:14] in the flesh, so that so then that they
[43:17] are in the flesh cannot please God. But
[43:19] you are not in the flesh, but in the
[43:21] spirit. If so be that the spirit of God
[43:23] dwell in you. Now if any man have not
[43:26] the spirit of Christ, he is none of his.
[43:28] And if his and if Christ be in you, the
[43:31] body is dead because of sin. But the
[43:35] spirit is life because of righteousness.
[43:38] But if the spirit of him that raised up
[43:41] Jesus from the d dead dead dwell in you,
[43:44] he that raised up Christ from the dead
[43:46] shall also quicken your mortal bodies by
[43:49] his spirit that dwelleth in you. Amen.
[43:53] I'm going to take a thought by the help
[43:54] of the Lord this morning titled the
[43:56] mystery made manifest. And I want to
[43:58] subtitle that from revelation to
[44:00] resurrection. The mystery made manifest
[44:03] from revelation to resurrection. Amen.
[44:05] Let's pray. Heavenly Father, we just
[44:06] thank you so much, Lord, just for this
[44:08] opportunity to be in the house of God
[44:10] this morning. Lord God, we've just come
[44:12] gathered together, Lord, not to hear any
[44:14] man, Lord, but to hear from the throne
[44:16] room of God. Lord, may you come and
[44:18] break the bread of life to us, Lord. May
[44:20] you move me aside as a vessel, Lord God.
[44:23] Father, may you just quicken, Lord, the
[44:25] word to our hearts, Lord God. May this
[44:27] be father, Lord, we're not thinking of,
[44:29] Lord, our h have to-dos for next week,
[44:33] Lord, or tomorrow. We're here, Lord
[44:35] Jesus. Father, for you to just speak to
[44:37] us, Lord God. Lord, may you open up our
[44:40] hearts to hear, Lord God, and receive
[44:42] whatever it is that you have from us,
[44:44] Lord. We love you now, and we ask it in
[44:46] the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. God
[44:48] bless you as you take your seats this
[44:50] morning.
[44:52] Amen. The text there, put this
[44:55] somewhere. Thanks, bro.
[44:57] The text here in Colossians is actually
[44:59] the text that brother Renham uses when
[45:01] he preaches Christ is the mystery of God
[45:04] revealed. Amen. I've been just studying
[45:06] that through through the last few weeks
[45:08] and it was there at the tabernacle in
[45:10] July of 1963. I've got some quotes from
[45:12] that sermon I want to dive in today here
[45:14] in a few minutes by the help of the
[45:15] Lord. Brother Random says that
[45:17] revelation is Christ's way of making
[45:20] himself known to the church to his
[45:22] church. Amen. You know, and to reveal
[45:24] something is simply just to make it
[45:26] known. We Webster's dictionary says
[45:28] reveal is to make known, especially in
[45:31] divine truth. Amen. And the prophet
[45:33] brings out in that sermon what he refers
[45:36] to as the three-fold purpose of Christ
[45:39] being revealed. Amen. He says the first
[45:42] thing was that God wanted to reveal
[45:44] himself to the people. And he couldn't
[45:46] do it as a great Jehovah God who covered
[45:49] all space, time, and eternity. He could
[45:51] not. He is too great to ever be revealed
[45:54] to people because it would be too
[45:56] mysterious. How could that great being
[45:58] that never did begin that after you went
[46:01] beyond the cycle of hundreds of billions
[46:03] and trillions of years of light space
[46:05] and on out into the in infinite into the
[46:08] eternity and a great creature was all
[46:10] that that was and still is. And that's
[46:12] why he had to do it in stages through
[46:15] the ages. It was a mystery that had to
[46:17] be unfolded. Amen. But what he wanted to
[46:20] do is what he he brother Benham says is
[46:22] he loved fatherhood for he was a father.
[46:24] And the only way for him to express that
[46:26] was to become a son. Amen. A man. And
[46:28] and I was just listening to him talk
[46:30] about this. That's the reason that Jesus
[46:31] kept saying the son of man. See they
[46:33] they didn't know what he was talking
[46:34] about. He said many of them. But now you
[46:36] get it. See he wanted to express
[46:38] himself. That was one of his three-fold
[46:41] purposes was to express himself identify
[46:44] himself with human beings to reveal
[46:47] himself in Christ. So you have first to
[46:50] express himself completely God in
[46:52] Christ. Brother Renham says second to
[46:54] have the preeminences by this in his
[46:56] church which is the body the bride till
[46:59] he could have the preeminence to express
[47:02] himself through them. Amen. And thirdly
[47:05] it was to restore the kingdom to its
[47:08] rightly position that fell by the first
[47:11] Adam back to where he walked in the cool
[47:13] of the evening with his people and he
[47:15] talked with them and he fellowshipped
[47:17] with him. So the way that it started all
[47:19] the way back in the beginning in
[47:21] Genesis, that's the that's what he
[47:23] wanted to restore it back to. Amen. And
[47:25] he says, "And now sin and death had
[47:27] separated them from this presence." And
[47:30] it was his entire expression, the
[47:32] three-fold purpose. So I've been looking
[47:34] at this ministry of Jesus here lately,
[47:36] and something that's been so captivating
[47:38] to me is the first miracle that Jesus
[47:41] did there in the in his earthly
[47:42] ministry. You know, we're all familiar
[47:44] with the marriage there in Canaa of
[47:45] Galilee. Amen. you know, uh, ministers
[47:49] often quote it in in marriage ceremonies
[47:51] and you know, Jesus and his disciples,
[47:53] they're all gathered together at this
[47:55] great celebration and and it's just this
[47:57] typical Jewish wedding. It's a joyous
[47:59] occasion, but they run out of wine. And
[48:01] and I just began looking at at that in
[48:03] all things for God to start choosing to
[48:06] to to start performing miracles in his
[48:09] ministry, it didn't seem like a very
[48:11] notable thing to do. Amen. He would
[48:13] perform things in his ministry that
[48:15] would raise the dead, that would that
[48:17] would heal the sick, that would open the
[48:18] blinded eyes. Amen. But the beginning of
[48:21] all of it of of in his ministry was this
[48:23] turning water into wine. But there was
[48:26] something about that first event. Amen.
[48:28] And you know, wine in in scripture has a
[48:30] deeper representation. If you just be
[48:33] with me here as as I as I build a
[48:35] foundation, wine in the scripture has a
[48:37] deeper representation. It represents a
[48:39] stimulation. Amen. Brother Benham says
[48:41] in the third seal, he starts talking
[48:43] about oil and wine and in the Bible how
[48:46] they always run together. They're often
[48:48] associated together. And we know as
[48:50] believers that oil as Bible readers that
[48:52] oil always types the spirit. And you
[48:54] know, remember in Matthew 25 that talks
[48:56] about the wise virgin and and her lamp
[48:58] and she had, you know, she had oil in
[49:00] her lamp when the bridegroom returned.
[49:02] Amen. Meaning that she was filled with
[49:04] the spirit. And wine represents a
[49:07] stimulation. And he says in this third
[49:09] seal, he says, "When the truth of a
[49:12] promised word of God has been truly
[49:14] revealed to his saints that's filled
[49:17] with oil, they all get stimulated."
[49:20] Amen. Wine is a stimulation. Glory. I
[49:22] feel it right now. He says, "Stimulated
[49:24] with joy." Shout. See, and when it does,
[49:27] it has the same effect upon them that
[49:30] wine does upon a natural man. Because
[49:33] when the revelation has been given of a
[49:36] truth of God and a true believer filled
[49:39] with oil and the revelation is revealed,
[49:41] the stimulation becomes so great that he
[49:44] makes himself behave unnormally. Amen.
[49:48] So it's meant to arouse something or
[49:51] cause a great effect in something. So
[49:53] you have the start of his ministry here
[49:55] on earth. There would be a stimulation
[49:57] of revelation as brother Brandham puts
[49:59] it. Amen. And it seemed like something
[50:01] insignificant. you know, just a ceremony
[50:04] that in my opinion could have been
[50:05] poorly planned out. They ran out of a
[50:07] natural drink. But catch this. The
[50:09] greatest thing that can ever happen in
[50:11] the life of a believer is when he gives
[50:13] you the revelation of who Jesus Christ
[50:16] is. It's the stimulation of revelation
[50:18] in your life. When you have a
[50:20] recognition that you and Christ are one,
[50:22] hallelujah, that he lives inside of you.
[50:25] Amen. And it's the beginning of your
[50:27] life. It's the start of whatever you
[50:29] have pre-ordained in this life. It's the
[50:32] start. Amen. It's the stimulation, the
[50:34] start of everything. The new birth.
[50:35] Brother Brandham says is the new birth
[50:37] is the revelation of Christ personally
[50:40] to you. Amen.
[50:42] You know, and watch this type here. The
[50:44] water being turned into wine. So what
[50:46] does he do? He takes the waters of life.
[50:48] Because the Bible says the word is life.
[50:51] Amen. And Jesus said that in John, he
[50:54] said, "My word is life." And and as we
[50:56] read there in Romans 8, that the spirit
[50:58] is life. So the word is life and the
[51:00] spirit is life. Meaning that they are
[51:02] one and the same. Amen. And the only way
[51:05] for the word to become a reality in your
[51:07] life is by a spiritual revelation or a
[51:11] stimulation of the spirit of God. Amen.
[51:13] And what the Bible refers to that is is
[51:16] as a quickening power. You know, because
[51:19] the spirit is what gives life to the
[51:21] believer. You know, I began looking at
[51:23] that that that term quickening power.
[51:26] Quickening. The term quickening in an
[51:28] it's actually used in for an expecting
[51:32] mother. The quickening time in an
[51:34] expecting mother refers to the first
[51:37] perceptible movements of a fetus in the
[51:40] uterus that are felt by the mother.
[51:42] Glory to God. And if you think of that
[51:43] this morning, the life that it was
[51:45] already in in the womb, the life was
[51:48] already there for the mother, but there
[51:50] came a time in her life where it became
[51:52] perceptible to her that there was a life
[51:54] now living in her. Hallelujah. There
[51:56] came a time in your life. There was a
[51:58] quickening power where you read the
[52:00] word. You came to church, but the Lord
[52:02] Jesus came and he quickened something in
[52:04] your life and it became perceptible to
[52:06] you as a believer. You you you you knew
[52:09] you you you could have you read the
[52:11] Bible and you tried to correlate things,
[52:13] but there was a quickening time. Amen.
[52:15] There was a revelation that struck you.
[52:18] Amen. And you thought about that this
[52:20] morning. She she knew that there was
[52:22] life. She's seen a change. But then a
[52:25] time comes where there's a vindication
[52:27] of that life that it's actually alive
[52:30] inside of her. Amen. And not void of
[52:32] life. Brother Benham says this and he
[52:34] says it in the Easter Seal. There's only
[52:37] one life, one eternal spirit, one
[52:40] eternal life and that's God. God alone
[52:43] is the eternal. And then we being his
[52:46] children are part of him. That is the
[52:48] attributes of his thinking. And the
[52:50] thought is expressed becomes a word.
[52:53] than each individual in here that
[52:55] possesses this eternal life was before
[52:59] the foundation of the world in God's
[53:02] thinking. It's the only way it could be
[53:04] because you're an attribute. That's the
[53:06] expression of a thought, not has become
[53:08] a word and a word has taken life and
[53:10] it's eternal. That's the reason that we
[53:12] have eternal life. He says in in the
[53:14] same principle that the great son of
[53:16] God, the redeemer, we become sons and
[53:19] daughters of God through that same
[53:21] spirit. Amen. that by the same
[53:23] fornowledge of God and he says remember
[53:25] you in the stature that you are in this
[53:27] morning if you wasn't in his thinking
[53:29] then that you're not now for you there's
[53:32] some part in you that's eternal and
[53:34] eternal only belongs to God and in God
[53:38] was his thinking of you sitting right
[53:40] where you are now in his thinking I
[53:42] stood at the pulpit this morning he says
[53:44] because he's infinite and he knows all
[53:46] things therefore he could tell the end
[53:49] from the beginning because he is eternal
[53:51] and You being a son and daughter of God,
[53:54] you were in his thinking at the
[53:56] beginning. And then when the Holy Spirit
[53:58] come and you're on earth walking around
[54:01] here as a sinner, way down in your life,
[54:04] there is something. Hallelujah. There is
[54:07] something that takes place. He says, you
[54:09] don't know what's taking place, but
[54:11] you're hungering. Amen. Every person h
[54:14] has that hungering and and the world is
[54:17] searching for it. They search for it in
[54:19] natural stimulation. Amen. But the life
[54:21] of a believer searches for it in the
[54:23] stimulation of the spirit of God. Amen.
[54:25] And at some point in your life, you were
[54:27] walking around like the rest of the
[54:29] world. But something took place inside
[54:31] of you. You know, in Romans, they call
[54:33] it a quickening power. You might have
[54:35] grown up in church. You might have
[54:36] believed God. But something took place
[54:38] in your life that actually made it a
[54:40] reality to you individually as a person,
[54:43] personally revealed to you. Amen.
[54:46] Some some preacher might have presented
[54:48] it in a way or or like brother Jason
[54:50] says, he he he was just sitting in a
[54:52] car. Whatever it was, something came
[54:54] alive in you. Amen. There was always
[54:56] something in you, but then there came a
[54:58] point where it was perceptible to you
[55:00] and it came alive. Amen.
[55:03] Hallelujah.
[55:05] Brother Benham says, "Look at the
[55:06] millions on earth that he didn't that
[55:09] didn't receive it when Jesus was here.
[55:11] But how thankful we should be this
[55:13] morning to know that we have the direct
[55:15] evidence, the Bible proof that we are
[55:17] included in the great resurrection
[55:19] morning." Oh, hallelujah. That great
[55:22] Easter, we have the earnest of it right
[55:24] now in our mortal bodies. You know, the
[55:27] earnest, the confirmation, it's that
[55:29] perceived life. It's the Holy Ghost,
[55:31] brother. The Bible calls it Christ in
[55:33] you, the hope of glory. Amen. You know,
[55:38] conception is is an incredible thing.
[55:40] Amen. It's it's something kind of
[55:42] unexplainable. Science tries to explain
[55:44] it, but it's supernatural. It's two life
[55:47] sources that come together and create
[55:49] one life source. Amen. And that's the
[55:52] same thing with a supernatural birth.
[55:54] The supernatural power of of a new
[55:57] birth. You receive something in your
[55:59] life. You're a new creature. The Bible
[56:02] calls you a new creature. All things
[56:03] have passed. Old things have passed away
[56:05] and all things become new. It's a it's a
[56:08] it's a supernatural event that takes
[56:10] place. Amen. And the seed was always
[56:13] there. It was always placed in the womb.
[56:14] Brother Brandham said, "But when
[56:15] stimulation came, it brings something to
[56:18] life in you."
[56:21] He says, "And it's it it's something
[56:23] that you couldn't desire to be in there.
[56:26] It's something that's contrary to your
[56:28] own nature. It's the fornowledge of God
[56:31] taking place, God's word.
[56:38] You know, when you're born again, and he
[56:42] was talking about this on Wednesday,
[56:43] when you're when you're born again, we
[56:46] can't let the devil deceive us
[56:49] if you still fall every once in a while.
[56:51] Because when babies are learning how to
[56:53] walk, parents don't get upset with them
[56:55] when they stumble. They may get upset
[56:57] when they cry and they won't stop
[56:59] crying, but they won't get upset if they
[57:01] stumble. Amen. They pick them back up
[57:03] again because they know they've never
[57:05] they've never walked this way before.
[57:07] They're not used to this. Amen. And so
[57:10] when Christ comes in you, Amen. There's
[57:12] a maturing taking place. It's the
[57:15] adoption period taking place in you.
[57:18] Amen. You have to have patience with
[57:19] yourself and you have to remind yourself
[57:21] that I am a child of God and I'm going
[57:24] to stand back up wherever I fell and
[57:26] give my life back to the Lord. Wherever
[57:28] I fell, I'm going to go back to that
[57:30] place and I'm going to surrender that
[57:32] thing to him. I might have fallen but I
[57:34] am going to get back up again. Amen.
[57:36] It's the process of maturing. Amen. He
[57:39] says you are you are on your way growing
[57:41] into the full resurrection. No tree
[57:43] comes up overnight. It's got to grow. As
[57:46] we grow in the grace and in the
[57:49] knowledge of God, you're baptized into
[57:51] that spirit. The thing to check is your
[57:54] desire. Amen. Does does your nature
[57:57] desire that holiness, that holy life?
[58:00] Amen. If you slip, do you do you hunger
[58:02] to get back up? Amen. Do you hunger for
[58:05] that holiness in your life? I thought of
[58:07] that speckled bird that Brother Ben
[58:08] Brandham calls. He, you know, in
[58:10] referring to Jeremiah there, he calls it
[58:12] the church of the living God. Amen. And
[58:14] and brother Brandham, he he says that as
[58:16] it's flying through the air there, it's
[58:18] flapping his wings. And what is it what
[58:20] is it doing? It's crying, "Holy, holy,
[58:23] holy unto the Lord." And what does that
[58:25] represent? It represents the blood of
[58:27] Christ. Amen. Speckled on the life of a
[58:29] believer. But what is it doing? It's
[58:31] crying holy, holy, holy unto the Lord.
[58:36] Amen. It's representing something. And
[58:38] that's the life of a true believer. Does
[58:40] the nature of your life cry holy, holy,
[58:45] holy unto the Lord? A true, it's a true
[58:48] vindication of the quickening in your
[58:50] life. Amen. And it's done from an inward
[58:53] desire. Amen. It's it's not from trying
[58:56] to match what you've been taught or
[58:58] trying to match your brother or your
[58:59] sister or be like everybody else, but
[59:02] when you desire to have the garments of
[59:05] righteousness in your life. Amen. And it
[59:07] matches the word. You don't want to live
[59:09] on the edge anymore. You want to live so
[59:11] far from that edge that you don't even
[59:13] know where that edge is anymore. Amen.
[59:15] Amen.
[59:15] It matches the word and the word then
[59:18] speaks for you. Amen.
[59:21] I want to try to turn turn a corner here
[59:24] if I can by the help of the Lord try to
[59:25] bring bring something together. When
[59:27] Jesus comes in Matthew the 4th 14th
[59:30] chapter, he's there on the mountain and
[59:33] he's teaching the multitudes. Amen. He's
[59:34] preaching the word and you know this was
[59:36] God in flesh preaching a sermon there on
[59:39] the mountain and after much teaching the
[59:41] people that they were there they were
[59:42] all day they were there all day they
[59:44] started to get weary and the disciples
[59:46] were going to send them away so that
[59:48] they could get some natural food but
[59:50] Jesus had another plan in his mind.
[59:51] Amen. You remember the little boy and a
[59:54] he had a few fish and a few loaves of
[59:56] bread. You know, and what I love about
[59:58] that that scripture is that he never
[1:00:00] asks the disciples to go out and to try
[1:00:03] to find food for the people or to try to
[1:00:06] figure it out himself. He didn't give
[1:00:07] this overwhelming task. They're sitting
[1:00:10] there racking their brain trying to
[1:00:11] figure out how are we going to how are
[1:00:13] we going to do what what he wants us to
[1:00:15] do with what we have. Amen. But see,
[1:00:17] Jesus, what what Jesus had them do is he
[1:00:20] had them bring what he h what they had
[1:00:23] to him. Amen. because he was the life
[1:00:26] source. He was the one that had the
[1:00:28] ability to multiply the bread of what
[1:00:30] they have. And you know, sometimes I
[1:00:32] just just naturally type in spiritually
[1:00:33] this morning, sometimes I believe that
[1:00:35] we within ourselves, we try to act like
[1:00:37] the disciples there. How am I how can I
[1:00:39] fathom this? How how am I going to make
[1:00:41] a rapture? How are we going to be
[1:00:43] perfected? How could my faith ever rise
[1:00:45] to a point of calling the dead saints
[1:00:47] back to life again? But see, all he's
[1:00:49] looking for you to do is bring what you
[1:00:51] have to him. Amen. He's the life source.
[1:00:54] He's the multiplier of bread. You bring
[1:00:56] what little faith you have to him and
[1:00:58] you watch him multiply it. Amen. You may
[1:01:00] have a need in your life. You bring what
[1:01:02] you have to him and watch him be the
[1:01:05] life source in your life. Amen.
[1:01:07] Hallelujah.
[1:01:09] Wow.
[1:01:10] You may need faith. You bring what you
[1:01:12] have to him and then you watch the
[1:01:14] mountains be moved. It's not an
[1:01:16] intellectual faith that you say, "I need
[1:01:18] the mountain moved." and you're trying
[1:01:20] to figure out how to move it and I just
[1:01:21] need to have more faith and I try to
[1:01:23] figure it out. You need to bring that
[1:01:25] thing to the Lord and you need to let
[1:01:26] him do it for you.
[1:01:30] You got to be like that little child
[1:01:32] where it may not seem like much to you,
[1:01:35] barely enough to get you through the day
[1:01:37] sometimes. Amen. But Brother Brandham
[1:01:39] says no matter what you got or how
[1:01:41] little it is, you say, "Well, Brother
[1:01:42] Brandham, the only thing I can do, I
[1:01:44] might be able to talk to some people."
[1:01:46] Well, that might not be very much to
[1:01:48] you, but you put it in the hands of the
[1:01:51] Lord Jesus Christ, and you watch the
[1:01:53] little fish, like the little fishes that
[1:01:55] was there in the boy's hand, it could
[1:01:57] only feed him. But when he put it into
[1:01:59] Jesus's hand, it fed 5,000.
[1:02:02] So, it will be with you. You put what
[1:02:04] you have in his hand. Amen. Whatever you
[1:02:09] have need of this morning, you put it in
[1:02:10] his hand. Glory to God. And brother
[1:02:13] Brandham says this in the Easter Seal.
[1:02:15] And you are quickened. And this
[1:02:18] quickening power brings your body into a
[1:02:22] raptured condition already. I want to
[1:02:25] say that again. And this quickening
[1:02:27] power brings your body into a rapturing
[1:02:31] condition when already. Amen. It's a
[1:02:35] present tense thing. It's not anything
[1:02:37] that you're going to do within
[1:02:38] yourselves. Amen. It's a quickening
[1:02:40] power. It's a stimulation by a divine
[1:02:43] power that something has now come alive
[1:02:45] in you that it takes the letter of the
[1:02:48] word and it quickens it makes it alive
[1:02:50] again and it makes you a part of that
[1:02:53] resurrection. Hallelujah. I am a part of
[1:02:56] that resurrection. Not by anything that
[1:02:58] I've done or anything I could say or do
[1:03:00] but because the life source lives within
[1:03:03] me. Amen. And two life sources met
[1:03:05] because he lives in me and he quickened
[1:03:07] that other one. Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:03:10] Hallelujah.
[1:03:11] So many times we try to be like those
[1:03:13] disciples. We try to understand or we
[1:03:15] try to grasp how it's going to be. How
[1:03:17] is it going to take place? We try to
[1:03:18] conceive it into our minds. How how
[1:03:21] would we ever feed 5,000 with two pieces
[1:03:23] of fish and five loaves? How could the
[1:03:26] dead be raised? H how could this happen?
[1:03:28] How is it going to be? How could someone
[1:03:31] walk on water? How could someone control
[1:03:33] the raging storms with his words? You
[1:03:36] know, but but see, even after all these
[1:03:38] things had happened, you know, there was
[1:03:39] still questions in their mind. Amen. If
[1:03:42] you pull that PowerPoint up for me,
[1:03:43] brother, there was still questions after
[1:03:45] their in their minds after he did those
[1:03:48] things. After he spoke to the storm,
[1:03:49] they said, "Who is this that even the
[1:03:51] winds and the waves obey him?" Prophet
[1:03:55] says, "If you'll just pull up the Okay,
[1:03:57] well that's all right. I'll just read it
[1:03:59] if that's all right. Praise the Lord. On
[1:04:02] the day of Pentecost, Brother Benham
[1:04:03] said, he said, on the day of Pentecost,
[1:04:06] they were all waiting up there in
[1:04:08] themselves. They were afraid, the Jews,
[1:04:12] just what they were going to do. So,
[1:04:14] they got scared. But what happened when
[1:04:16] this quickening power fell from heaven,
[1:04:19] there was a bravery set upon them. There
[1:04:21] was something, an understanding where
[1:04:24] they wasn't too sure of it a few hours
[1:04:26] before. They know he had died. They know
[1:04:30] he had risen. They had talked to him on
[1:04:32] the way. But was that thing for them or
[1:04:36] was it just for Jesus himself? But here
[1:04:39] on the day of Pentecost, the Holy
[1:04:41] Spirit, the abstract fell upon the
[1:04:43] believers that made them part of the
[1:04:47] resurrection. It made him part of his
[1:04:50] fellowship. The Holy Spirit came and
[1:04:52] confirmed to them that they would be
[1:04:55] raised up again because they were
[1:04:58] potentially raised up then from cowards
[1:05:01] to brave men. There was something new
[1:05:03] living in them. They walked with the
[1:05:05] word and flesh. But there was still a
[1:05:07] cowardly behavior living in them. But
[1:05:09] when that spirit came and quickened that
[1:05:11] life in them, there was a new bravery
[1:05:14] that set upon them. There was a word
[1:05:16] that was quickened to life again.
[1:05:18] Hallelujah.
[1:05:20] There they were, he said, afraid of the
[1:05:22] very word that they had thought. Don't
[1:05:24] let this pass over you. They were
[1:05:25] afraid. They knowed he was the word.
[1:05:28] Even the Jews, he, Brother Ben, this
[1:05:30] quote's almost over. Even the Jews had
[1:05:32] to admit it. Nicodemus said, "Rabbi, we
[1:05:34] know that you're a teacher that's come
[1:05:36] from God. No man could do the things
[1:05:38] that you do except God be with him."
[1:05:40] Now, we know that. We recognize that.
[1:05:41] So, the disciples, Peter had even sworn
[1:05:44] in his presence, all them forsaken him
[1:05:46] at the crucifixion. But there they are
[1:05:48] now up in this upper room in the
[1:05:51] presence of God. Then all of a sudden,
[1:05:53] here comes this Holy Spirit down from
[1:05:55] heaven and it quickened them and the
[1:05:57] quickening took place that they wasn't
[1:06:00] afraid to make witness of the message
[1:06:02] that they believed and they knowed to be
[1:06:05] the truth. Otherwise, they were afraid
[1:06:07] of it. Amen. Even though God himself was
[1:06:10] vindicating his word in flesh through
[1:06:12] Christ and they witnessed all those
[1:06:14] miracles and those signs and uh and
[1:06:16] wonders until the upper room until
[1:06:19] Pentecost, it couldn't be comprehended
[1:06:21] completely. You know, they believed it.
[1:06:23] See, and there was always something in
[1:06:25] them to believe it. They identified it
[1:06:27] themselves with that word. They they
[1:06:29] walked with his ministry, but until they
[1:06:31] became a part of his resurrection, amen.
[1:06:35] Something that came down, it was a
[1:06:37] confirmation of the promise. Amen. That
[1:06:40] Jesus now would identify himself in
[1:06:43] them. Amen. The same life that he lived
[1:06:46] would now be living inside of them. And
[1:06:47] brother Brandham says, "Now this is the
[1:06:49] spirit. It's the spirit that quickens.
[1:06:51] It's not the word that quickens. It's
[1:06:53] the spirit that quickens the word or
[1:06:56] gives the word life. It gives it wings
[1:06:59] to fly. It gives it access. Before that
[1:07:03] time, there was only ever partial
[1:07:05] access. You could try to comprehend.
[1:07:08] You'd try to understand like the
[1:07:09] disciples. But now, the spirit had
[1:07:12] quickened them, the word in them. Amen.
[1:07:14] And it gave them wings to fly. And when
[1:07:18] that confirmation happens, brother
[1:07:20] Random says, "When this body receives
[1:07:22] the spirit of God, the immortal life
[1:07:26] inside of you, it throws this body in
[1:07:29] subjection to God." I think he read that
[1:07:31] quote Wednesday. Hallelujah. The B that
[1:07:34] are born that of those that are born of
[1:07:36] God does not commit sin. He cannot.
[1:07:38] There is no condemnation to them that
[1:07:40] are in Christ Jesus. They walk not after
[1:07:43] the flesh, but after the spirit. See,
[1:07:46] there you are. It throws your body
[1:07:48] subject. And when you become subject to
[1:07:51] that spirit, it throws your whole being
[1:07:54] subject to the spirit. And that spirit
[1:07:57] is nothing in the world but this seed
[1:08:00] word made manifest or quickened or made
[1:08:04] alive. Amen.
[1:08:08] Just tying some things together here. So
[1:08:10] when you look at the earthly ministry of
[1:08:13] Jesus, he began it with revelation, the
[1:08:17] stimulation of revelation. We talked
[1:08:19] about that, you know, the marriage
[1:08:20] supper. And he thought it was necessary
[1:08:21] to have that be the beginning event.
[1:08:24] Amen. Amen. There was that that event
[1:08:26] that because the greatest miracle that
[1:08:28] took place in your life was when Jesus
[1:08:30] was revealed to you. Amen. It changes
[1:08:32] your nature. Amen. It's something in
[1:08:34] your life. And then you fast forward to
[1:08:37] the final miracle that takes place in
[1:08:39] the Jesus in Jesus's life on earth. You
[1:08:41] have the most important event in all of
[1:08:43] history. It's the resurrection on Easter
[1:08:45] morning. Amen. The moment in time that
[1:08:47] God had planned from before the
[1:08:49] beginning to reconcile us back to being
[1:08:52] sons and daughters living in his
[1:08:55] kingdom. So the beginning was the
[1:08:57] revelation. If you think in types, the
[1:08:59] start of your life is when God has made
[1:09:02] flesh in you. Amen. the Christ in you,
[1:09:04] the hope of glory. And as a sinner, it
[1:09:07] turns you upside down. It changes your
[1:09:09] opinions. It sets your affections on
[1:09:12] things above. And the things that you
[1:09:14] used to do, it's beneath you. The
[1:09:16] desires have changed. Amen. And then he
[1:09:18] can begin to express himself to you, the
[1:09:21] individual. And we talked about that,
[1:09:23] how it's always been about expression.
[1:09:25] Amen. Brother Bham said he wanted to
[1:09:27] express himself and identify himself
[1:09:30] with human beings in Christ. And if you
[1:09:33] think of that word expression, it means
[1:09:36] that you are making known or you're
[1:09:39] revealing your thoughts and your
[1:09:42] emotions. So this great infinite God
[1:09:46] wanted to reveal himself to you the
[1:09:50] individual. And you know just just
[1:09:52] bringing it down this morning thinking
[1:09:54] of this just as a father or mother when
[1:09:56] you love your child you want to express
[1:09:59] your love to them. Amen. You want them
[1:10:02] to know how you feel about them. You
[1:10:05] embrace them. You love to talk to them.
[1:10:08] You love to hear them to talk to you.
[1:10:11] You want to know who they are and and
[1:10:14] you want them to know you're express
[1:10:16] it's an expression. Amen. You express
[1:10:19] how much you love them and you display
[1:10:21] it in your actions and it's a joy. And
[1:10:23] you know the the prophet explains he
[1:10:25] says and sin and death had separated
[1:10:27] them from his presence and his entire
[1:10:31] expression because remember the third
[1:10:34] part of that three-fold plan was to
[1:10:37] restore that fellowship that Adam and
[1:10:39] Eve had the walking in the cool of the
[1:10:43] evening. Amen. Back to where they could
[1:10:45] he could fellowship with him. It was
[1:10:47] about this fellowship. It was a
[1:10:48] restoration of this beautiful thing that
[1:10:51] he once had. And and yes, I yes, God
[1:10:55] knew that Adam would fall. He knew every
[1:10:59] He knew he would make that mistake. But
[1:11:01] he also knew one day that he could
[1:11:04] restore them back. Amen. Brother Bham
[1:11:06] said that through his life, just trying
[1:11:08] to catch a thought here. Brother Bham
[1:11:09] said through this life, his son, his
[1:11:11] cross, the blood, that he might
[1:11:13] reconcile himself a body, a bride, which
[1:11:16] is Eve, the second Eve. So, if you just
[1:11:19] could catch my heart this morning, if
[1:11:21] you had a son and you knew that a
[1:11:23] certain point in his life, a time would
[1:11:25] come where he would be given
[1:11:27] independence, the ability to make his
[1:11:30] own choices, the ability to make his own
[1:11:33] decisions, and you knew he was going to
[1:11:36] make the wrong choice. Even though you
[1:11:38] warned him not to, even though you
[1:11:40] pleaded with him not to, even though you
[1:11:42] showed him what the consequences of that
[1:11:44] choice would be. Amen. death, separation
[1:11:48] from perfection, from the garden, from
[1:11:50] fellowship.
[1:11:52] And you knew for a time he would walk,
[1:11:54] he would walk away from you and your
[1:11:56] word. But you knew that even though he
[1:11:59] would make a wrong choice and that he
[1:12:01] would go against your advice and your
[1:12:03] word, that one day he would come back to
[1:12:06] his senses again, that he would be
[1:12:08] reconciled. Amen. That you could redeem
[1:12:11] him back to that fellowship you once
[1:12:13] had. Because for a time there was a
[1:12:16] beautiful fellowship that you have with
[1:12:17] your child. But then there gets a point
[1:12:19] in their life where they have to make
[1:12:21] their own decisions. They grow up. They
[1:12:22] have independence and they may go
[1:12:24] astray. They may do what they want. Oh,
[1:12:26] but you know in your mind that there's
[1:12:28] going to be a fellowship that can be
[1:12:30] reconciled. Would you choose not to
[1:12:32] create that? Oh, would you choose not to
[1:12:35] because maybe for a while but you knew
[1:12:37] there would be a redemption come. That
[1:12:40] is the expression of a heavenly father
[1:12:42] this morning. That is the expression of
[1:12:45] your heavenly father. He knew you would
[1:12:47] fall. He knew how you would fall. He
[1:12:50] knew where you would fall. But he also
[1:12:52] knew the very moment that you would come
[1:12:54] back to him. Amen. He knew that there
[1:12:56] would be a moment in time just like when
[1:12:59] when that prodal son there would be a
[1:13:01] moment in history where he could run
[1:13:04] toward you and he could embrace you once
[1:13:06] more. Hallelujah. He could reconcile
[1:13:09] himself back to having a fellowship and
[1:13:12] walking in the cool of the evening, but
[1:13:14] it had to be done in a certain way
[1:13:17] because sin separates you from God.
[1:13:19] Amen. It separates you from holiness.
[1:13:22] You have to live a holy life. So God had
[1:13:24] to send his son. He had to die on a
[1:13:27] cross. Blood had to be shed. But it was
[1:13:29] all about a reconciliation that could
[1:13:31] take place. Hallelujah. And on the
[1:13:33] individual life, he had to do these
[1:13:36] certain things. And he knew you would
[1:13:37] fall, but he also knew there would be a
[1:13:40] time. He knew there would be a time
[1:13:42] where he would come back and be able to
[1:13:45] embrace you once more. Oh my brother, my
[1:13:48] sister, let the Lord embrace you once
[1:13:50] more. Oh, whatever life that you're
[1:13:52] living, don't live without the Lord in
[1:13:55] it. Amen. Oh, let him redeem you back.
[1:13:58] Amen. He's already paid the price. He's
[1:14:01] already purchased you. He's just waiting
[1:14:04] on that quickening time to take place.
[1:14:06] He's waiting for that seed to manifest.
[1:14:09] He's waiting for a certain pre-ordained
[1:14:11] time in history to take place in your
[1:14:14] life. Hallelujah. Wow.
[1:14:22] You know that even through all of this,
[1:14:25] the word said, "The day you eat of that
[1:14:29] tree, you shall surely die."
[1:14:35] So they should have died.
[1:14:38] That is the expression of the heavenly
[1:14:40] father that he went against his own
[1:14:43] covenant. He went against his own word.
[1:14:45] Amen. He said, "You will die." Amen.
[1:14:50] Because he knew there would be a part, a
[1:14:54] time in history where he could get them
[1:14:56] back. Amen.
[1:15:01] That it could be restored.
[1:15:06] You know, I just my wife Joy and I were
[1:15:08] talking about it this morning along
[1:15:10] those lines and just thought this was
[1:15:13] something that we she had mentioned and
[1:15:15] I thought this was an amazing argument.
[1:15:18] You know, if we in our mortal bodies
[1:15:21] could have just one conversation with
[1:15:25] someone in glory right now, and I'm
[1:15:28] talking about someone who went through
[1:15:31] some pretty hard things in their life.
[1:15:34] I'm talking about maybe the saints
[1:15:36] through the dark ages that had to give
[1:15:37] their life for Christ. I'm talking about
[1:15:40] people that have gone through things.
[1:15:41] And I know we go through things
[1:15:42] spiritually. We type the natural here.
[1:15:44] We're going through things now. But if
[1:15:46] we could we if we could have one
[1:15:48] conversation with any one of those
[1:15:50] people right now, I promise you, oh, I
[1:15:54] guarantee you that they would say that
[1:15:57] every moment of it was worth it.
[1:16:00] Hallelujah. That every single time, oh,
[1:16:04] that they had to take a lashing. Every
[1:16:06] single time that they had a mind battle,
[1:16:09] every single time there would be a week
[1:16:10] of anxiety, every single time there was
[1:16:13] depression that set in, every single
[1:16:15] time they was worth it because now for a
[1:16:18] time they had to go through that. But
[1:16:20] now for eternity, they could live in the
[1:16:22] presence of the king of the world. There
[1:16:25] would be joy and peace. There would be
[1:16:28] no more sorrow. Oh, it would be a
[1:16:30] beautiful thing. Not a single one of
[1:16:32] them would ever take back what they did.
[1:16:35] Amen. because we try to conceive it in
[1:16:37] our minds. Why is there such a oh why is
[1:16:39] there all this? It's because God
[1:16:41] conceived a perfection and we broke the
[1:16:44] perfection and now God is getting us
[1:16:46] back to perfection again. Hallelujah.
[1:16:50] Hallelujah.
[1:16:51] You could have one conversation.
[1:16:54] Thanks be to God.
[1:16:57] a life that may not have seemed fair to
[1:17:00] the world
[1:17:02] if you could talk to them right now.
[1:17:07] This was the last quote I had on the
[1:17:09] PowerPoint, but we don't have a
[1:17:11] PowerPoint, so that's probably my fault,
[1:17:13] bro. No worries. Um, I wanted you to
[1:17:16] follow along, but um, it's all right.
[1:17:18] I'll just read it. Brother Benham says,
[1:17:20] "In Christ is the mystery of God
[1:17:23] revealed." Now notice again what his
[1:17:26] three-fold purpose making himself
[1:17:30] manifest in Christ Jesus to come into
[1:17:33] the body by Jesus Christ to have the
[1:17:35] preeminences to what? To restore back
[1:17:38] Eden and bring that which was lost. That
[1:17:41] was the only thing out of order. All the
[1:17:43] rest of his things was in order. Catch
[1:17:46] this. He says, "But he had to let and
[1:17:49] put man on free moral agency to fall
[1:17:51] that he might be a savior and to display
[1:17:54] what's in him." See, his attribute of
[1:17:56] savior, something had to be lost. And
[1:17:58] the very thing that man fell and became
[1:18:00] lost, he became a savior of that taking
[1:18:03] his own law and he could not do it as
[1:18:05] that great Jehovah that we talked about
[1:18:07] that covered all space and time. See, he
[1:18:09] couldn't do it. So, he had to become
[1:18:11] man. And then he took kinship with that
[1:18:13] man that was lost to become God and made
[1:18:16] flesh. God became from God to become me
[1:18:19] to take my sin upon him that he might
[1:18:22] make me him. Amen. I want to say that
[1:18:24] again because that is a tongue twister.
[1:18:26] God became me. God became me to take my
[1:18:30] sin upon him that he might make me Amen.
[1:18:33] him. Hallelujah.
[1:18:36] Glory to God. back to his great purpose
[1:18:39] of sons and daughters of God for he is
[1:18:43] the eternal father. The attribute was in
[1:18:46] him. So that had to be displayed. See
[1:18:51] it was always an expression. He says
[1:18:53] this is I think this is the last maybe
[1:18:56] the last quote brother says
[1:18:57] predestinated there's the mystery he
[1:19:01] before Christ or anything ever was on
[1:19:03] earth. You see his great mystery that he
[1:19:05] chose the bride knowing Eve would fall
[1:19:07] from disbelieving the word knowing that
[1:19:10] she would fall but he would choose a
[1:19:12] bride that would not fall that would
[1:19:15] hold to the word regardless of what the
[1:19:18] rest of the world had to say about it.
[1:19:20] They would hold to the word. They are
[1:19:22] predestinated to stand there. The
[1:19:24] adoption of children by Christ Jesus
[1:19:26] predestinated to the church to that
[1:19:29] glorious stand. Now you see his secret.
[1:19:32] He says what? To restore fallen Eve as
[1:19:36] she was a prefigure of the church.
[1:19:41] You know, so from the start of his
[1:19:44] earthly ministry, he started with he
[1:19:47] starts with the revelation in your life
[1:19:49] and then he goes through stages bringing
[1:19:52] you back into fellowship, the adoption
[1:19:54] period, finding your position, maturing
[1:19:56] you. Amen. Unfolding his plan to you
[1:19:58] personally. This is a great plan of God.
[1:20:01] And when you can read these things and
[1:20:04] faith cometh by hearing, Amen. and
[1:20:06] hearing of the word of God, by
[1:20:08] understanding the word of God, and only
[1:20:10] God can give you an understanding to to
[1:20:13] read these things and comprehend it.
[1:20:15] Amen.
[1:20:16] Then he sweeps all the way all the way
[1:20:18] down to his final miracle in your life.
[1:20:21] And the final thing is the resurrection.
[1:20:24] Amen.
[1:20:26] But you know, pastor always says this.
[1:20:27] Jesus says that I am the resurrection.
[1:20:33] The resurrection is a person.
[1:20:36] Amen. It's not just an event. It is an
[1:20:39] event that will take place. I believe
[1:20:41] it. Hallelujah. But it's not just an
[1:20:43] event. It is a person that is revealed
[1:20:46] to you, the individual. Amen. That makes
[1:20:49] you a part of that event. Amen.
[1:20:53] Amen.
[1:20:54] And in order for you to be a part of the
[1:20:57] resurrection, you have to have the
[1:21:00] revelation. Amen. Flesh and blood hath
[1:21:03] not revealed this to you. He said to
[1:21:05] Peter, "But my father which is in heaven
[1:21:07] hath revealed this to you. And upon this
[1:21:09] rock, upon this revelation, Amen. I will
[1:21:12] build my church." And you know, you
[1:21:14] start you start looking at Jesus, you
[1:21:16] know, after the resurrection. And you
[1:21:18] know, he started appearing. And I was
[1:21:20] listening to brother Brenham talk the
[1:21:21] other day. He He didn't start appearing
[1:21:23] to the unbeliever. Amen. He didn't start
[1:21:26] appearing to Caiaphasis and to Pilate.
[1:21:30] That was never in his nature. It was
[1:21:32] never in his earthly nature to say, "I
[1:21:35] told you so." He didn't appear to those
[1:21:36] and show them who he was. He didn't
[1:21:38] think that it was important to put them
[1:21:40] in their place. Amen. He went above all
[1:21:43] worldly thinking. He just appeared to
[1:21:46] the elected believer. Amen. because it
[1:21:49] was a continuation of his ministry. It
[1:21:52] was a continuation of him of him
[1:21:55] expressing himself to the believer.
[1:21:58] Amen. A gentle nature. Amen. The nature
[1:22:02] of Christ. Amen. And he wanted to
[1:22:04] display that that nature could now live
[1:22:07] in human flesh. Amen. He would express
[1:22:11] his nature. And just in some in some
[1:22:15] closing thoughts here, uh he would John
[1:22:18] the 8th chapter, you know, when the
[1:22:20] Pharisees and the teachers of the law
[1:22:22] caught that woman in the act of
[1:22:24] adultery. Amen. We're familiar with the
[1:22:26] story. They brought her to Jesus and
[1:22:27] they asked, "What would you do with this
[1:22:29] woman?" Knowing what the law had said,
[1:22:32] knowing that because of the sin that she
[1:22:34] committed, it was written in the law to
[1:22:37] be stoned. Amen. John John, if you want
[1:22:40] to pull that up for me. John 8.
[1:22:43] But what they didn't realize what was
[1:22:46] while they were over there trying to
[1:22:48] keep some law, they were dead in sin and
[1:22:52] trespasses. And he came to set them free
[1:22:57] from that law. Amen. So that the law
[1:23:00] could live in their hearts. Because we
[1:23:02] read there that there was no way for the
[1:23:05] person to uphold the law. But when the
[1:23:08] lawgiver was placed in the person, then
[1:23:11] it can be done. Hallelujah.
[1:23:14] I love how the scripture puts that. If
[1:23:16] you if you have it, John 8:es 5. Now
[1:23:19] Moses in the law commanded us that such
[1:23:22] should be stoned. But what sayest thou?
[1:23:26] This they said, tempting him that they
[1:23:28] might have to accuse him. But Jesus
[1:23:31] stooped down and with his finger wrote
[1:23:35] on the ground. Amen.
[1:23:38] As though he heard them not. And again
[1:23:42] he stooped down and wrote on the ground.
[1:23:45] And they which heard it, being convicted
[1:23:48] by their own conscience, went out one by
[1:23:51] one, being at the eldest, even unto the
[1:23:54] last. And Jesus was left alone. And the
[1:23:57] woman standing there in the midst. I
[1:24:00] thought that was so rich because they
[1:24:02] caught her in the midst of this sin.
[1:24:05] Amen. But just by the humility of our
[1:24:08] savior bringing just the the bringing
[1:24:11] their conscience up to them, they were
[1:24:14] able to one by one leave his presence,
[1:24:16] you know, and it was by it was them that
[1:24:19] brought her into the presence of Jesus.
[1:24:22] Amen. And that's sometimes what can
[1:24:24] happen in our life. The accuser can come
[1:24:27] into your life and he can catch you in
[1:24:29] the act of adultery. He can catch you in
[1:24:32] the act of sin. And he brings you to the
[1:24:35] life source and says they are guilty of
[1:24:38] this particular thing. They are guilty
[1:24:40] because I caught them in the act. Amen.
[1:24:42] You know, but what he does is it's
[1:24:44] because when you get into his presence,
[1:24:46] it doesn't matter what you've done. He
[1:24:48] has a way of of making it all right
[1:24:51] again. Amen.
[1:24:52] He has a way of writing something on the
[1:24:54] ground. I like to think that he was
[1:24:56] writing on the ground to his accusers to
[1:24:58] the devil saying that I no longer hold
[1:25:02] her sin to her charge anymore. Amen. She
[1:25:05] though she was dead though you did catch
[1:25:08] her. Hallelujah. I have set her free.
[1:25:11] Hallelujah.
[1:25:14] And she was left alone standing in his
[1:25:20] midst. the expression of Christ to the
[1:25:24] believer to get us to walk the way he
[1:25:27] walked to get us to talk the way he
[1:25:29] talked. You know, he could have gone
[1:25:30] down a list and you know, you did this
[1:25:32] and you did that. He knew you did that
[1:25:34] and you did this. He didn't do that. He
[1:25:37] just by a simple humble expression said,
[1:25:41] "Is there any of you who don't have sin
[1:25:45] and you condemn her who does?" And at
[1:25:47] least she has an openness about it, but
[1:25:50] you're dead living in sin and trespasses
[1:25:52] as well. It was the expression. It was
[1:25:54] the the nature of a man who would one
[1:25:58] time in your life be able to live in you
[1:26:01] and then you as a believer could express
[1:26:04] him to the world. That was the part of
[1:26:08] the three-fold purpose of Christ so that
[1:26:10] you could live as a believer and express
[1:26:14] him to the world. Hallelujah.
[1:26:17] The expression.
[1:26:19] Hallelujah. It was the accusers that
[1:26:22] brought her before Jesus. But there was
[1:26:25] something in her. Amen. There was a seed
[1:26:27] in here.
[1:26:29] And then when she got into the presence
[1:26:32] under the right circumstances.
[1:26:35] See, you can go your life and you could
[1:26:38] be in his presence and there could be
[1:26:40] things happening all around you. There
[1:26:43] has to be the right circumstances. Amen.
[1:26:46] There has to be a there is there's a
[1:26:48] pre-ordained time. Amen. And when God
[1:26:51] elects you and called you from before
[1:26:53] the foundation of the world, he knew
[1:26:55] when that time would be. Amen. And even
[1:26:58] if it's the devil who caught you in
[1:27:01] whatever it is that you're living up in,
[1:27:03] God can take whatever it is and turn it
[1:27:06] around. Amen. She came to that place
[1:27:09] condemned to death. They were going to
[1:27:11] stone her. And she left forgiven of her
[1:27:13] sin and her trespasses. And she didn't
[1:27:16] die. She was the only one who left that
[1:27:18] place with life. Hallelujah.
[1:27:21] Oh, I don't ever want to be in a place
[1:27:23] where I can be in the presence of God.
[1:27:25] And I have an opportunity to leave with
[1:27:28] the life source in me. Amen. Don't let
[1:27:30] yourself be like those Pharisees where
[1:27:32] you can get continually into the
[1:27:34] presence of God. Amen. But you never
[1:27:36] allow the life source to live in you and
[1:27:39] you leave different. Amen. You need to
[1:27:41] leave different than you came in.
[1:27:43] Hallelujah.
[1:27:44] There was something lacking in her life.
[1:27:47] She was obviously searching for it in
[1:27:49] her earthly desires. And that's what
[1:27:51] happens to you and I. We search for
[1:27:53] things in our earthly desire because
[1:27:55] there's a hungering. There's a thirsting
[1:27:58] and she was caught in that. Oh, but then
[1:28:00] the life source came and granted her
[1:28:03] that water. Hallelujah. And it sustained
[1:28:06] her. Hallelujah.
[1:28:09] Hallelujah.
[1:28:10] What those Pharisees I thought about
[1:28:12] this. what those Pharisees were
[1:28:14] expressing to her was the dead letter of
[1:28:17] religion. And never let anybody say that
[1:28:21] the message is some dos and don'ts. I'm
[1:28:25] talking about a person. I'm talking
[1:28:27] about Christ. The nature of a man who
[1:28:30] who who did no sin, who can live in your
[1:28:34] mortal bodies, who can quicken you to
[1:28:36] life again.
[1:28:38] Amen.
[1:28:38] Hallelujah. It's the nature of the
[1:28:40] person of Jesus Christ. Amen. Who I've
[1:28:43] been I was living in my own self. I was
[1:28:46] living for lustly desires. But God came
[1:28:48] and quickened me. Hallelujah.
[1:28:51] Thanks be to God. That's the Jesus that
[1:28:54] I offer. I don't offer you the the kind
[1:28:57] of Jesus or the kind of law that those
[1:29:00] Pharisees offered. I offer you the Jesus
[1:29:05] in John chapter 8. Amen.
[1:29:07] That's the offer this morning. If the
[1:29:10] only gospel that you've ever heard is a
[1:29:12] gospel, and I know you haven't, but just
[1:29:14] for sake of drama, if you have only been
[1:29:17] offered that in terms of religion, it's
[1:29:19] been misrepresented to you. Amen. The
[1:29:23] gospel is Jesus Christ, the very
[1:29:26] expression of a heavenly father who had
[1:29:29] a three-fold purpose to identify himself
[1:29:33] in you. Amen.
[1:29:34] Amen. despite what you've done. Despite
[1:29:37] what she did, oh, it doesn't matter what
[1:29:40] you've done. He can erase it. He can
[1:29:42] change it. Hallelujah.
[1:29:44] It's a quickening power. I believe we
[1:29:47] were all caught up in the same situation
[1:29:49] at that woman as that woman was living
[1:29:51] for ourselves, living, you know, for the
[1:29:54] pleasures of life. But one day there was
[1:29:56] a pre-ordained meeting, a time that took
[1:29:59] place and the Lord had arranged things
[1:30:02] for me to be brought into his presence.
[1:30:04] Wherever that was, his presence can be
[1:30:07] anywhere. Oh, as long as you invite him
[1:30:09] there. Amen. And it can change you
[1:30:12] forever. Amen.
[1:30:16] Totally condemned, caught up.
[1:30:20] Amen.
[1:30:25] you are part of. Let's go ahead and
[1:30:26] stand to our feet. If the musicians
[1:30:28] would come,
[1:30:47] the mystery
[1:30:49] made manifest
[1:30:51] in you that you are part of the
[1:30:55] resurrection. a present tense. The
[1:30:58] nature of that person living in you,
[1:31:03] living through you, a quickening power.
[1:31:06] There was a resurrection of the dead in
[1:31:10] my life in your life when you as a
[1:31:13] believer perceived that there was a
[1:31:16] movement of life now living in your
[1:31:19] mortal body. Amen. You perceived there
[1:31:22] was always life there. There might have
[1:31:25] been a desire there, but then there came
[1:31:26] a time in life where you perceived that
[1:31:30] there was life.
[1:31:32] Amen. When I realized that Romans 8
[1:31:36] became a reality to me by the grace of
[1:31:39] almighty God and my desires were
[1:31:41] different, my outlook was different. I
[1:31:43] was different. And sure, I still made
[1:31:45] mistakes. Sometimes we still do.
[1:31:48] But something changed. Amen. We were
[1:31:51] quickened.
[1:31:54] God is good, isn't he?
[1:31:56] Amen.
[1:31:59] Brother Benham says that's it. Christ
[1:32:00] the word. He was the word. He is the
[1:32:02] word. And the church becomes the word by
[1:32:05] him making her a part of him. And that's
[1:32:09] the word again. Personally identified by
[1:32:12] him. His property alone. She is redeemed
[1:32:16] by him, through him, for him, and for
[1:32:18] him alone. Thanks be to God. That's what
[1:32:21] the devil's howling about.
[1:32:24] Christ in you, the hope of glory. Let's
[1:32:26] just close our eyes this morning.
[1:32:30] The mystery made manifest. Amen.
[1:32:34] There's just someone here just under the
[1:32:37] sound of my voice that just wants to
[1:32:39] raise a hand to the Lord and
[1:32:43] surrender yourself to him or there's
[1:32:45] just something on your heart. I invite
[1:32:47] you to do that this morning.
[1:32:51] Heavenly Father, we just are grateful
[1:32:53] and thankful, Lord Jesus, for the word,
[1:32:56] Lord, for the purpose in our life, for
[1:32:58] what you've done, Lord Jesus, and for
[1:33:01] what you're doing continually, Lord.
[1:33:03] Thanking you, Lord, for quickening us,
[1:33:06] Lord. Thank you for, Lord, making us
[1:33:09] alive again, Lord. Thank you that even
[1:33:11] though I made poor choices, even though
[1:33:13] I made the wrong decisions, Lord, you
[1:33:16] still chose, Lord God, to to have me
[1:33:20] come to be, Lord, because you knew that
[1:33:22] one day, Lord,
[1:33:24] you knew that one day you could redeem
[1:33:27] me and it could be reconciled, Lord.
[1:33:30] Father, you saw every hand that went up,
[1:33:32] Lord. Father, you see every heart, Lord.
[1:33:35] May you just come down, Father, and make
[1:33:38] your word live, Lord Jesus. As I was
[1:33:41] praying, Lord, for today, Lord, I just
[1:33:45] kept saying, Lord, I know there's
[1:33:47] nothing, Lord, that could be said in my
[1:33:51] own way or in my own notes, Lord, that
[1:33:52] would mean anything, Lord God, but it
[1:33:54] would be your presence that would come,
[1:33:56] Lord. And we saw how, Lord, just being
[1:33:58] in your presence can just turn a whole
[1:34:00] life around, Lord God. Thank you for
[1:34:03] turning our lives around. And if there's
[1:34:05] any that needs their lives turned
[1:34:07] around, let it be so I pray. We love you
[1:34:10] now. We commit everything to you into
[1:34:12] your mighty hands in Jesus name.
[1:34:17] Amen.
[1:34:19] Amen. Let's just praise the Lord.
[1:34:23] Whatever you're singing, bro, just let's
[1:34:24] just

[1:35:01] a love letter in the sky.

[1:35:16] I could have had a really different
[1:35:20] story,

[1:38:10] Father, thank you for the love that you
[1:38:12] have for me, Lord. Father, for each one

[1:38:28] just be with every heart, Lord God,

[1:38:32] Lord, let the word not leave our hearts,
[1:38:34] Lord. Let us ponder it today, Lord. And
[1:38:37] as we go into our week, Lord, may you
[1:38:39] just walk with us, Lord, in everything
[1:38:42] we do, just commit these people into

[1:38:51] Amen. Let's just worship the Lord a
[1:38:53] little bit. Whatever's on your heart.
