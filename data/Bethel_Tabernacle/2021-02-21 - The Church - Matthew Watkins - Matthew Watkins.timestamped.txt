[1:12] god bless you let's all stand to our
[1:13] feet this morning
[1:15] amen matthew chapter 20 and if you have
[1:18] your bible we'll turn there
[1:20] amen matthew 28.
[1:25] i'd like to begin a series here teaching
[1:29] for our sunday school and uh the lord
[1:32] just has just placed this upon my heart
[1:34] and i would like to just title this very
[1:36] simply
[1:37] the church it's our title today is
[1:40] the church matthew 28 we'll begin
[1:42] reading at verse 18.
[1:49] and jesus came and spake unto them
[1:51] saying all power
[1:53] is given unto me in heaven and in earth
[1:57] go ye therefore and teach all nations
[2:01] baptizing them in the name of the father
[2:03] and of the son
[2:05] and of the holy ghost teaching them to
[2:08] observe
[2:09] all things whatsoever i have commanded
[2:12] you
[2:12] and lo i am with you always
[2:15] even unto the end of the world amen may
[2:18] you be seated you can be seated this
[2:20] morning may the lord have his blessing
[2:22] amen to the word this morning we'd like
[2:24] to just begin a series here
[2:26] on the church and in this series i'd
[2:27] like to cover
[2:29] what is the church and it's amazing so
[2:32] many times when you
[2:33] understand you take people's definition
[2:37] of what the church
[2:38] is and what we even would
[2:41] reflect today and say what we believe
[2:43] what is church when we ask that question
[2:46] we could also ask the same question why
[2:48] a church uh why not a temple
[2:51] why not a mosque why not a you know a um
[2:55] a uh you know what commune what whatever
[2:58] different
[2:59] times of types of types or forms
[3:02] that religion has produced for a place a
[3:05] gathering a meeting place so why do we
[3:08] gather in a church what is the church
[3:11] and what is the purpose i think is
[3:14] probably the most important question we
[3:15] could ask
[3:16] is what is the purpose of the church
[3:20] why what is the purpose of coming to
[3:22] church these are all things we like to
[3:24] just look at
[3:25] because i believe that we have a real
[3:27] good answer i believe that the word
[3:29] teaches
[3:30] is a teacher and and there's so much uh
[3:32] that we could
[3:34] learn from it so we'd just like to begin
[3:36] that today we read matthew 28
[3:38] uh in very popular scripture here in
[3:40] verse 19 when jesus commands and
[3:42] commissions
[3:44] the church now in matthew 28
[3:47] the church hadn't even been born yet but
[3:50] this is the commission from jesus
[3:52] because we know that the
[3:53] the beginning the birth the alpha
[3:57] the origin and the the original the
[3:59] genesis
[4:00] the seed the beginning in the beginning
[4:03] of the church was in the book of acts
[4:06] and brother branham tells us that that
[4:08] it was there was an
[4:09] peter preached the inaugurational
[4:12] message
[4:13] and his inaugurational message was to
[4:16] repent
[4:17] and be baptized every one of you in the
[4:20] name of jesus christ and you shall
[4:22] receive the gift of the holy spirit you
[4:24] could read the book of acts
[4:26] to follow along with that to see what
[4:28] the first
[4:29] church that's why we call it that the
[4:31] first church let's cover just some
[4:33] uh some details here because many
[4:36] oftentimes we call church um
[4:39] a building and we think of it that way
[4:42] we know it's not none of us
[4:43] all of us here as believers know that
[4:45] the church isn't the building
[4:47] but yet we all still refer to i'm going
[4:50] to church
[4:51] and so i'm going to what do we mean when
[4:53] we say i'm going to church well i'm
[4:55] going to a place on 2608 mossy oak road
[4:59] or wherever that is for you and so um
[5:02] for those of you streaming today but we
[5:05] what do we mean when we say it it's
[5:07] obviously it's
[5:08] not a building the word
[5:11] church that we find in the bible is a
[5:14] translation of the greek word ecclesia
[5:17] and it it simply means an assembling
[5:21] or a gathering or an assembly of people
[5:24] that's where we get the word
[5:25] assembly we call it this is our local
[5:29] assembly it's our local gathering our
[5:32] local
[5:33] church it's also that greek word
[5:35] ecclesia
[5:36] also means the called out
[5:39] ones and that's cliche in a lot of
[5:43] in a lot of ways but think about that
[5:45] just for a moment
[5:47] think about that title that when jesus
[5:49] established a church and called us to a
[5:51] church
[5:52] we are the called out so we are we've
[5:56] been
[5:56] called out of something and now we're
[5:58] something what are we what have we been
[6:00] called out of the world we've been
[6:01] called out of sin
[6:03] and jesus has called each one of us out
[6:07] not as a group but as an individual he's
[6:09] called us
[6:10] out of our sins and then we make up
[6:14] the gathering the assembly the ecclesia
[6:17] and so the the the word there doesn't at
[6:20] all mean
[6:21] building but it's a it's a it rather
[6:23] speaks of people
[6:25] and lives and souls and so
[6:28] romans 16 uh verse five you don't have
[6:32] to turn it's amazing
[6:33] because it speaks of the church
[6:37] actually it says greet the church
[6:40] that is in the home that is in the house
[6:43] and so the bible refers to a church
[6:45] in a house now you got to be careful
[6:47] when you say that because
[6:49] you know we have groups that that think
[6:51] it's that all we do is
[6:53] the the entire body in the ministry of
[6:55] the church is just to gather in homes
[6:56] and play tapes and
[6:57] you know good godly sincere people but
[7:01] um sincerely wrong and you say how are
[7:03] they wrong about brother matt because
[7:05] that's not what the word teaches we're
[7:07] going to learn that the
[7:08] word teaches that the church has a
[7:12] purpose
[7:13] and we don't try to redefine that
[7:15] purpose
[7:17] we don't try to remake it up as we go
[7:19] along and just decide
[7:21] you know we're going to become more
[7:23] modern that's what the modern church has
[7:24] done what
[7:26] the what you have today in the modern
[7:28] church is so distant
[7:30] from what the first original intent and
[7:32] purpose that jesus had
[7:34] when he established the first church so
[7:37] there's a pattern
[7:39] and brother branham said that he said
[7:40] there's a pattern and he said and that
[7:42] pattern must always remain true we never
[7:45] try to change that pattern
[7:47] and he said that pattern was the first
[7:49] church
[7:51] in the book of acts on the day of
[7:53] pentecost
[7:55] not the denomination of pentecost on the
[7:58] day of pentecost that
[8:00] feast that where the church was born
[8:02] that is the pattern
[8:03] brother branham says it's so
[8:04] emphatically in the church age book he
[8:06] says there
[8:07] is no other pattern
[8:10] so what do we pattern ourselves after
[8:13] the word
[8:13] which was the first church can you say
[8:16] amen
[8:18] and so it's not a it's not a
[8:21] a building but it's a he says that let
[8:24] me go back to romans 16 but it's a
[8:26] group uh and he even greets them in
[8:28] their house so it's
[8:29] meaning that it's a group of people it's
[8:31] a body
[8:33] of believers uh it's the body of christ
[8:36] i want you to turn to ephesians chapter
[8:38] one if you have your bible just turn
[8:40] there with me in your
[8:41] in your bible ephesians chapter one
[8:45] i had some quotes from the prophet
[8:48] ready and i just didn't uh i don't know
[8:50] that we'll get to them today
[8:52] uh to to just the the line of the
[8:55] foundation that we're laying here we may
[8:56] not get to show you those that i'll
[8:58] probably read some
[8:59] from up here but not ones that i have
[9:01] ephesians chapter 1
[9:03] and i just want to begin reading at
[9:05] verse 22.
[9:07] and hath put let's begin at verse 20
[9:10] just for context
[9:11] which he wrought in christ when he
[9:13] raised him from the dead and set him at
[9:15] his
[9:16] own right hand in the heavenly places
[9:18] far above all principality and power and
[9:20] might and dominion
[9:22] and every name that is named not only in
[9:24] this world but also in that which is to
[9:26] come
[9:27] and hath put all things under his
[9:30] feet and gave him
[9:33] to be the head over all things
[9:37] to the church so he is the head
[9:40] who are we talking about who's the he
[9:42] christ
[9:44] and he says gave him to be the head
[9:47] over all things to the church which
[9:50] is his body amen
[9:54] which is his body not now now we're not
[9:58] just talking about
[9:59] a body of believers like a body of land
[10:03] or a body as a group we're not just
[10:05] talking about a a segregated group
[10:07] but now he goes further and says in fact
[10:10] that
[10:11] group that that segregated group that
[10:14] that called out separated i should say
[10:17] separated
[10:18] group is not just a body but it's
[10:21] his body the fullness of him that
[10:24] filleth
[10:25] all in all which is his christ
[10:28] body so we are the body of christ and he
[10:31] says
[10:32] which is his body the fullness of him
[10:35] that filleth all
[10:37] in all so that
[10:40] body we have a body here today and he's
[10:42] using that figuratively
[10:44] of our own body that here we are today
[10:46] and we all
[10:47] all of us have a head today or else you
[10:51] would be dead
[10:53] all of you have a head but
[10:56] figuratively he's speaking of something
[10:58] that that head
[10:59] controls the rest of the body
[11:03] in that head is the intelligence
[11:04] remember brother i'm talking about that
[11:06] in the head is the intelligence it tells
[11:09] the body what to do
[11:11] but yet on the opposite side of that i
[11:14] have no hands but your hands
[11:16] i have no feet but your feet so without
[11:19] the body
[11:20] the head can do nothing and without the
[11:23] head the body could do nothing
[11:24] so who is what is the headship it's not
[11:27] a man
[11:30] what is the headship of the church it's
[11:32] not a man
[11:35] and and men have been placed there
[11:38] erroneously
[11:39] it's not a man we have a pastor we
[11:41] believe in a pastor we believe in god
[11:43] using that
[11:44] the elder of the church but the head
[11:48] of the body is christ
[11:51] it's not a bishop it's not a pope it's
[11:53] not a prophet
[11:55] not a man it's not the headship of the
[11:57] world the headship of the word was not a
[11:59] prophet was not a man was not a teaching
[12:01] or a doctrine it was
[12:03] christ we mean that in the most in the
[12:06] most
[12:06] literal way we possibly can say it it is
[12:09] christ
[12:10] amen who is the head
[12:14] let's go on just a little bit further
[12:16] and he says god placed
[12:18] all things under his feet and appointed
[12:19] him to be the head over
[12:21] everything for the church so here he is
[12:23] referring to the church
[12:25] again and so the body's made up of
[12:28] believers in jesus christ and it starts
[12:32] on the on the
[12:33] in acts chapter 2. i want you to read
[12:35] there in acts chapter 2 and let's just
[12:37] begin reading in acts 2 and we'll just
[12:39] begin reading in verse 1.
[12:41] acts 2 verse 1. i know they already have
[12:43] it but i just want you to
[12:45] to get it there i hear pages turning and
[12:47] that's wonderful
[12:50] amen
[12:52] i i can tell you that there's something
[12:55] very special about reading
[12:57] the pages of your bible it's good to
[12:59] have it on the screen but
[13:01] take take my word for it open your bible
[13:03] at home
[13:04] and you're in your off time and read the
[13:06] literal it's good to have audio i love
[13:09] we're living in the day of technology
[13:10] i'll just insert this here
[13:12] we're living in the day of technology
[13:13] where you could just have audio bible
[13:15] and you could hear the bible and you put
[13:16] it in your
[13:17] airpods or whatever you decide to use
[13:23] you put it there and you listen to that
[13:25] but that's good it's good to hear the
[13:27] word but
[13:27] there's something special about reading
[13:29] the word
[13:31] something special about when the word is
[13:33] read and you read it for yourself
[13:35] and you comprehend it the lord can i
[13:38] just believe uses that in a special way
[13:41] and when the day of pentecost was fully
[13:43] come they were
[13:44] all with one accord in one place
[13:48] and suddenly there came a sound from
[13:50] heaven as a rushing mighty wind
[13:52] and it filled all the house where they
[13:54] were sitting and there appeared unto
[13:56] them cloven tongues like as a fire
[13:59] and it sat upon each of them and they
[14:01] were
[14:02] all filled with the holy ghost and began
[14:05] to speak with other tongues
[14:07] as the spirit gave them utterance so
[14:09] verse 4
[14:11] is a transition it's a beginning it's a
[14:13] new dispensation this hadn't
[14:15] ever this isn't an event that you're
[14:17] reading that was repeated
[14:19] it was the second time it wasn't that
[14:21] this was the first time this is what
[14:23] jesus spoke of in john i think chapter 7
[14:26] when he says
[14:27] he that believeth on me shall out of his
[14:31] belly flow rivers of living water and he
[14:34] says and then in your
[14:35] parentheses there in your king james
[14:37] bible it says for he spoke of the spirit
[14:40] that had not yet been given that's
[14:42] exactly what it says there so it was all
[14:44] prophetic it was all
[14:46] moving towards something john was filled
[14:48] with the spirit
[14:49] from his mother's womb meaning on his
[14:51] flesh there was a purpose upon his life
[14:54] as the same way that shamgar was filled
[14:57] with the spirit on his flesh
[14:59] there was a purpose samson had it but
[15:01] the spirit in
[15:02] this way that you're reading in verse 4
[15:04] had never happened yet
[15:08] because the spirit as jesus said had not
[15:10] yet been given but
[15:11] now now the new the the dispensation
[15:15] begins let's read it here again
[15:16] and they were all filled with the holy
[15:18] ghost and began to speak with other
[15:19] tongues as the spirit gave them
[15:20] utterance
[15:21] and there were dwelling in jerusalem
[15:23] jews development and every out of every
[15:25] nation
[15:26] under heaven now when this was noise
[15:28] abroad the multitude came together when
[15:29] conf
[15:30] were confounded because that every man
[15:32] heard them speak
[15:33] in his own language and they were all
[15:35] amazed and marveled saying one to
[15:37] another behold
[15:38] are not all these which speak galileans
[15:40] and how here we
[15:41] every man in our own tongue which
[15:43] wherein we were born
[15:45] and he goes to lis list those countries
[15:47] all the way down through verse 11.
[15:49] and they were all verse 12 i'm amazed
[15:52] and we're in doubt saying one to another
[15:54] what
[15:54] meanest this in other words what's
[15:57] happening what's going on what's taking
[15:59] place
[16:00] we've never heard this before others
[16:02] mocking say these men are full of new
[16:04] wine but peter
[16:05] standing up with the eleven lifted up
[16:07] his voice
[16:08] and said unto them you men of judea and
[16:12] all that dwell at jerusalem be this
[16:13] known
[16:14] unto you and hearken to my words for
[16:16] these are not drunken
[16:17] as you suppose see and it is but the
[16:20] third hour of the day
[16:21] but this is that which was spoken by the
[16:25] prophet joel
[16:26] and it shall come to pass and he quotes
[16:29] joel
[16:30] and it shall come to pass so now he's
[16:32] identifying
[16:33] there's a prophecy there's a scripture
[16:36] and this is that
[16:38] this is that fulfillment the same way
[16:40] when jesus the bible says
[16:42] he handed the the scroll back to the
[16:44] priests and said this day this scripture
[16:46] is fulfilled
[16:47] and he points to a prophecy and he says
[16:49] now it's came to pass right here before
[16:51] your very eyes
[16:54] and now here's peter standing up saying
[16:56] this is
[16:57] that this is what was prophesied and
[17:00] let's look at what he quotes here he's
[17:02] quoting joel in verse 17
[17:03] and it shall come to pass in the last
[17:05] days saith god
[17:06] i will pour out my spirit upon all flesh
[17:10] and your sons and your daughters shall
[17:12] prophesy
[17:13] and your young men shall see visions and
[17:16] your old men
[17:17] shall dream dreams
[17:20] what's he speaking of there he's saying
[17:22] what is that prophecy about your young
[17:24] men will see
[17:25] visions because they've never seen
[17:27] anything like this before it's something
[17:28] god's going to do
[17:29] and your old men will dream dreams in
[17:31] other words they'll look back
[17:33] and say hey this is what was coming this
[17:35] is what was prophesied and here it is
[17:37] right now before us
[17:39] and he says and your young men shall see
[17:40] vision your old men shall dream
[17:43] dreams uh uh where am i at verse
[17:46] 18 and on my servants and all my
[17:49] handmaidens i will pour out in those
[17:51] days of my spirit and they shall
[17:53] prophesy and i shall show wonders in
[17:56] heaven above and signs in the earth
[17:57] beneath blood and fire and vapor and
[17:59] smoke
[17:59] sun shall be turned so it's a
[18:02] it's a fulfillment it's a fulfillment of
[18:06] prophecy now look what peter very
[18:09] familiar
[18:10] uh scripture here he says here
[18:13] in verse 38. verse let's actually start
[18:17] at verse
[18:18] 37. now when they heard this they were
[18:21] pricked in their heart
[18:23] and said unto peter and to the rest of
[18:25] the apostles men and brethren
[18:27] what shall we do that word there is
[18:30] amazing when you when you
[18:32] look at that word when it says they were
[18:34] pricked in their heart it doesn't just
[18:35] mean
[18:36] it doesn't just mean that they were
[18:38] curious
[18:41] it really doesn't it's not at all what
[18:42] it's saying it's not saying they went
[18:44] you know it's pretty good peter you know
[18:46] tell us a little bit more
[18:48] but actually that word pricked is this
[18:50] is the way that they give an adrenaline
[18:52] shot to the heart
[18:53] it's stabbed pretty amazing when you
[18:57] think about that
[18:57] you go click on that greek word it's
[18:59] stabbed in the heart that's
[19:01] that's how that's how graphic he's
[19:04] trying to tell you that this is
[19:05] what the preaching of the word of god is
[19:08] supposed to do to the
[19:10] to people it's supposed to not just
[19:13] tickle their ears or tickle their
[19:15] intellect but it stabs them in the heart
[19:18] it pricks them in the heart they're
[19:19] conflicted by it and they say
[19:21] what shall we do then peter said unto
[19:25] them
[19:26] and this is this is what brother branham
[19:28] says is the inauguration it's the banner
[19:30] it's the
[19:31] first sermon he says then peter said
[19:32] unto them repent
[19:34] and be baptized every one of you in the
[19:37] name of jesus christ
[19:39] for the remission of sins and you shall
[19:42] receive the gift
[19:43] of the holy ghost for the promises unto
[19:45] you and to your children
[19:47] and to all that are afar off even as as
[19:50] many as the lord our god shall
[19:52] call and with many other words he
[19:54] testified and exhorted now
[19:56] here's the first church here's the first
[19:59] sermon and here's the inaugurational day
[20:04] many things throughout the book of acts
[20:07] you'll read all about that church and
[20:09] the
[20:09] exploits and the things that god did and
[20:11] then you pick that up
[20:12] into paul's letters as churches are
[20:14] starting to become established
[20:16] and so that was the first uh church let
[20:19] me just find my notes here
[20:21] and so that was that was the commission
[20:23] where am i at
[20:25] that was the commission to the church
[20:28] and so
[20:30] so what is the purpose i just want to
[20:31] get to some of this here today what is
[20:33] the mission
[20:34] i wish so bad i had this up before on
[20:36] the screen and i don't i'll have it for
[20:38] next time lord willing
[20:40] the prophet of god in 1954 looking for
[20:42] jesus
[20:44] he says there is the mission of the
[20:47] church
[20:48] there is the mission so the church has a
[20:50] mission
[20:51] it's not just a just a a body just just
[20:54] to be a body but it has a mission
[20:56] has a purpose he says there there is the
[20:59] mission of the church
[21:00] is to preach the gospel
[21:03] to demonstrate the power
[21:08] he says oh we've passed tracks
[21:10] everywhere
[21:11] but that ain't what it takes it takes
[21:13] the power
[21:14] and demonstration of the holy spirit
[21:18] truly now you can go
[21:21] so far over to one to one side
[21:25] where you say oh we that means we just
[21:27] need to look for an emotional experience
[21:29] and it's all about
[21:30] you know tongues and it's all about
[21:32] great
[21:33] miracles and what is the gospel it's
[21:34] just all about this great fan
[21:36] fantastic really that's one way that
[21:39] charismatics went
[21:40] so they went to seed on that there's a
[21:42] truth and a real
[21:44] experience and a real physical
[21:45] experience you could have with the holy
[21:47] spirit i've had it
[21:48] multiple times in my life it's wonderful
[21:50] but what is the prophet of god really
[21:51] saying he's saying
[21:52] that that that word that we have that we
[21:55] read that's on paper what is the true
[21:57] mission of the church
[21:58] to demonstrate the life of jesus
[22:02] in a body to the world
[22:06] that's the real mission of the church
[22:08] it's not about demonstrating tongues or
[22:10] some
[22:10] external gift or some gift of the spirit
[22:13] but it's about a church that's
[22:14] christ-like that demonstrates
[22:16] jesus christ in their life to the rest
[22:20] of the world
[22:22] i just say lord that's my i want that
[22:25] more than anything
[22:26] in the whole world i want to i want to
[22:28] have the power of the holy spirit

[27:46] and teaching and doctrine and
[27:48] understanding and
[27:49] and grouped in with that just as
[27:51] important and
[27:53] in fellowship and breaking of bread
[27:56] that's sharing a mill together that's
[27:57] what it means

[28:00] meal with another believer and have
[28:02] fellowship

[28:06] hospitality tradition that's
[28:08] biblical breaking bread
