out of this generation how did you ever make it you know all the discouragement and all the the lies that we hear and all the false doctrine and different things that goes on in the world and they'll say how in the world did you make it out of this wicked and adulterous generation and the only thing i believe they'll say is we just held on and that's all we can do every day just hold on no matter

today i want to make just one brief announcement we announced it wednesday night and i think today if i'm not mistaken is the deadline for our young people to get registered ahead of the crush and once we open up public registration it's expected to fill up very rapidly perhaps within hours so please make sure bethel tabernacle parents young people senior youth that you get registered we're going to have a glorious time i was just looking at some of the testimonies if you go to if you go and look at our website you see the camp from last year and just some wonderful testimonies were just a sampling of so many that i heard about young people saying you know i i you know received the baptism of the holy ghost and only only months before had been wondering is the message even real and now i know it's real and running on with jesus and others saying the same thing how the power of god moved we had young people here in our own assembly right here in bethel tabernacle who received the token in their life right then amen praise the lord i've heard their testimonies to me so we know the power of god is moving we we have wonderful ministry coming for this year so we're looking forward to that so today i think is the last day for our bethel youth to be able to register uh on a private link before the public link opens st john chapter five saint john chapter 5 and we're going to read uh verses 24 through 29 and just appreciating the the lord in this study i certainly have needed him and he is i tell you the lord is just the most faithful friend you'll ever have and uh just so reliable and so uh so responsible over his family and you know if it was all up to us man it would just fall down right away i know it would fall down if it was all up to me but i'm glad that he just overlooks my fault and sees the need and one one singer sang at one time said he overlooked my fault and saw the seed i say blessed be the name of the lord so we want to carry on today by the help of the lord and we're we're going on into part three of the seven vials of revelation and we're just going to we're trying to go slow and i'm trying to do that on purpose so we really want to get into the nuts and bolts of some of it today and move into those eight or nine consecutive services that brother branham took when he was at least going along the theme of the seven vials he makes it very clear that he would like to have a time and a place to specifically take it like he did the seals where it becomes just a uh you know seven eight nine services of bible study but he he couldn't get the facility and the lord didn't bring it like that he still kept longing for it he wanted to do the trumpets the same way but we find that as we look closer at the message we find that he did teach many things out of the trumpets and out of the vials and correlated a lot of things together for us that you really can only see uh in the entire body of his teaching if you go to any one servant one service you're not gonna get it but if you if you understand the whole thing in its entirety then you can put a lot of the pieces together this is why there's a need for the five-fold ministry to rightly divide the word of truth because you know i've spent my my lifetime uh since a boy studying and putting it all the picture together in my mind you say brother jason where are you where are you getting all this i can only say it's been you know years since a child that i began studying the prophet's message comparing it to the scripture and uh have found it to be a hundred percent spot on uh you're indefensible if you try to resist it from the bible it's an indefensible position and so uh i appreciate it that's why you know we no one preaches i promise you no one preaches harder that you should hear the tapes of god's prophet but you still need an elected ministry to rightly divide the whole thing out and draw out and put all the pieces together for you amen so that's god's order of doing things and we very much appreciate it i would have no ability to do it i promise you that would have no ability if i wasn't able to lean back on a prophet's tapes i would have no ability to bring anything of understanding men have tried they probed at it but god sent one vindicated voice in this day believe that friends amen i hope you believe that because that's your that's the path to getting out of here is to receive him whom god hath sent they asked jesus how can we do the works of god and that was his answer believe him whom god hath sent so whenever christ reveals himself to a messenger in any age you should follow that if you want to live amen john chapter 5 verses 24 to 29 now we've taken the first two parts and we've read out of revelation 16 concerning the seventh vial i don't need to do that today partly because i've already done it twice and additionally because we'll have it up here on the screen just shortly i have some stuff i've been promising to show you and i got a lot more that we won't get to today so you just give me your undivided attention and let me get to what i want to get to amen i won't wear you there's no death worse than being drugged to death so we won't we won't do that to you verily verily saint john 5 24 verily verily or truly truly or surely surely i say unto you he that heareth my word and believeth on him that sent me hath everlasting life and shall not come into the condemnation but is passed from death unto life that one verse has the value of eternity uh they could never write enough volumes of books to fill up the whole world that would be more valuable than that verse amen verse 25 verily verily i say unto you the hour is coming and now is when the dead shall hear the voice of the son of god and they that here shall live for as the father hath life in himself so hath he given to the son to have life in himself now watch and conjunction and not only does he have the power to give life but anne hath given him authority to execute judgment also because so there's a reason because he is the son of man all right now that's an office the son of man marvel not at this for the hour is coming in which all that are in the graves shall hear his voice now he's jumped all the way to the end time now he's just talked about saint john 5 24 that those who have believed him have passed from death to life never come into the judgment so they're already resurrected by the time this voice is sounding this is the general resurrection uh coming at the end of the millennium and shall come forth they that have done good unto the resurrection of life and they that have done evil unto the resurrection of damnation so he's calling forth the remnant of the woman's seed and those who face judgment they're all coming to his judgment bar and they're there they will get a fair trial i appreciate that that's a comforting word to the whole world people can say to me you know what what's going to be my fate uh if i refuse this thing you call a message i'll just simply say well you'll get a fair trial i can promise you that and you'll get a fair trial from an unbiased judge who will look at your heart and he knows what he revealed to you and he knows what you were called to and he knows what you did with what you had when you had it and so so there there's nobody going to be able to cry foul at the judgment bar and if you go and read matthew 25 you don't find anybody crying foul you don't even even the people resigned to their fate and led away are not gold kicking and screaming crying injustice they realize that there's apparently at that point all the veil is lifted and you you see yourself as you really are now the advantage that we have today is we can look in god's mirror and see who we really are now you don't have to wait till you get there amen because now there's mercy so i would say to you today if you don't know him in the power of his resurrection you're at the right place at the right time and a tremendous opportunity lays before you let's pray father we thank you for your word and i just move into it lord as i begin to feel your anointing and declare as you would have me declare i commit myself into your hands unworthy as i may be but lord you are worthy and you have made in christ we are worthy now lord that's not something we could do to ourselves of ourselves for ourselves but you have purposed it lord and you have carried it out and we say today blessed be the name of the lord now give us lord the word that we need for the present distress we commit it to you in jesus name amen god bless you you can be seated all right so i understand then that um this should be working brother mark so brother caleb i'm going to power off and power on you put my powerpoint up please and remember the instructions we're starting from a certain slide let me advance one and let me see if that's the one no you you're you started too far back go to seven i think is what i sent to the booth there you go beautiful all right so we're advancing on and today we're carrying on the seven vowels of revelation and we want to look at a correlation between the seven trumpets and the seven bottles let me test this and try to go back okay perfect seems to be working brother mark you're a good man uh we'll we'll see if if if technology holds up because i have an embedded video thanks brother tony uh can i get yeah you're right never mind that's that's the one yeah and um and we'll see if it plays and brother caleb i i sent it to you with the volume muted it should stay muted even though it doesn't look muted but it if you hear sound uh then yeah pardon yeah you're you're the man all right so let's look now at some things the prophet said here in an exposition of the seven church ages i have a number of things and statements i want to take from the church age book brother branham says though this is from the introduction though this volume will concern itself with the various major doctrines such as the godhead water baptism etc found in revelation chapters one through three its main theme is the setting forth of a detailed study of the seven church ages now watch this is necessary in order to study and understand the rest of the revelation for out of the ages come the seals excuse me and out of the seals come the trumpets and out of the trumpets come the viles like the first burst of a roman candle the church ages come forth with a mighty initial illumination without which there could be no further light but once the brilliance of the seven church ages is given by divine revelation light upon light follows until the whole of the revelation opens wide before our wondering eyes isn't that a wonderful promise and we edified and purified by its spirit are made ready for his glorious appearing even our lord and savior the one true god jesus christ all right um i think i can go we'll just leave it right there for now so so when we are looking at at the revelation that god brought in this day under the opening of the seven seals and as i've said to you before and i don't have a lot of time for backgrounding today so if you've missed part one and two i would highly advise you to go back and listen to it because it really i've spent a lot of time and effort identifying where we are in prophecy and that's important because once you identify where you are in time as it relates to prophecy then you then you know what god's up to you know what the devil's up to and you know what you're supposed to be up to amen so uh so you don't just want to you know just gloss over it and say well you know i wasn't here for that service and i'm not going back to get the archive well that's your loss because it'll better equip you to understand uh the hour and the challenge that we face in this day now so when we when we see what he's done and and and as he says out of one thing comes another and comes another and comes another we've told you how that the seventh seal is the overview of it all everything is under that seventh seal everything happens under the seventh seal all the trumpets sound under the sixth seal which indicates a time of tribulation when they come into their fullness but we've also now found out that during the ages that that there are partial uh renderings there are partial fulfillments coming under the trumpets just like there were partial seals partially opened during the ages and with partial opening of the word then there was a brad called out and and in the trumpet it's god dealing with israel down through history uh he's gonna slowly bring them back to the day of atonement because they rejected christ it went to the gentiles but we find that they're going to discover when when moses and elijah go to them with the message of the hour when they take to them the message like that you have enjoyed for years the mighty god unveiled the token the invisible union they're going to understand that and and moses and elijah are going to be able to go into the trumpets in depth because brother branham he he he wanted to do that like he did the seals and and and god told him he already preached it under the seals and so he takes feast of trumpets my mom and dad uh were uh live at that service and so so we find that that when you have that seal partially opened down in every age you had trumpets partially open and that's why you read about judgments brother branham talks about that in each age and i'm going to say this again shortly i'm just saying it in repetition so you get it but we fight going to find out that that during each of the ages when he's opening partially a seal and a messenger catches it when there's a rejection of that then there's a partial uh opening of a vial correlating to that age and pours out a judgment and the trumpets record it and it'll say things like a third of this died and a third of that died meaning temporary it's not the full thing which is going to come in the tribulation period but you don't want to discount the fact that these that the seals and the the ages the seals the trumpets and the vials have been and are affecting life as you know it and they are they are moving in god's plan of redemption and that's an important point and brother branham gives us enough teaching on the trumpets and in the vial so that we can know that so that you can know what i just said is true all you got to do is go and study brother branham's teachings on the book of revelation and he said a ton of stuff showing and went right into the trumpet showing how they were applying and back in the ages because every time you had an age uh to the to the gentiles and and a seal partially opening and a messenger you also had a trumpet correlating to that for the jews and and then before the second age or the second seal would begin you'd have you'd have that first trumpet and then the second in the age for the gentiles and then a second to the jews and then a third and a third and a fourth and a fourth and all the while the vials or the plagues or the judgments are pouring out partially under those partial openings it makes sense now that all worked fine until we got down to this end time day and you're going to see one of the things i've been telling you that it's going to make this age completely unique from those ages because it's a restoration all the way back to the alpha age the alpha church under the apostles that early church before they began to to cool off and relax and backslide and uh and that's why when you see brother branham begin the church ages he begins with that with that falling that that relaxing so he says the he talks about how the church ran for a couple decades uh under the perfect word of god and so uh going into the ages as every time they kept losing the realities of christ and losing the teaching and brother branham talks about irenaeus last one to understand the godhead perfectly and so every time they they lose something and it's because of their backsliding and then when they lose it then god seals it away and he seals it under and by the time you get to the end it's all sealed up it's under seven seals and can't even be known and so by the time they crown a false prophet in the fourth age they've already rejected christ at nicaea and they've been put away and and and now god is dealing uh as the as the son of god in mercy back in the eternities interceding on behalf of the ignorance of the people because he's not going to lose his children see and you can't disbelieve what you don't know so the sin is unbelief that's what sin is and so you can't be you can't be found guilty of sinning and disbelieving something you you don't know at all see so so you see that god has it all covered he has a plan for it he even has a plan for the for the natives as brother branham said the heathens who never even got a chance to hear the gospel be raised up in the millennium to hear it and have a chance at it you say well who's not going to believe it living in the millennium well adam and eve fell in the garden so it's not going that's not going to stop anything see so so they're going to be and the judgment bar now will give every man a fair trial but i'm thankful that the bride down through all the ages old testament and new will be with him hallelujah the four and 20 elders are already seated on 12 thrones and now there's there's a place for you to sit hallelujah amen and i just said a mouthful all right now let me let me try to make some tracks so it's all redemption it brings everything back that that's what the seventh seal does it it re it redeems everything that was lost it's going to come through god's threefold plan of uh of of making himself manifest in christ and then he's going to have preeminence down through the church ages in his church by the holy ghost and by the seven spirits of god which are going which is one god speaking in seven ages through seven messengers yes amen so so so i so look there's no need to kick against the pricks the seven spirits of god speak through seven messengers and so if you want to hear the spirit of god you have to hear the seven i mean that's not hard all right and that's the way complain all you want but that's how god designed it see all right now so it's all redemption it's all about bringing everything back we found out last wednesday not only the bride is redeemed uh we find out that in the tribulation the threefold purpose because you know in this site it's to re to make himself manifest in christ to get preeminence in his bride through the ages and then to restore the bride back to her rightly position that fell by sin in the garden all right so we find then that in the tribulation it's a time of purging it's a time of purging 144 000 elected jews it's a time of purging the remnant of the woman's seed the foolish virgin and it's a time of purging the earth excuse me um i apologize for that the medication i take chokes me up horribly in the morning so i just have to hack and cough my way and preach through it but it's all right amen so if i cough and you feel you need to cough just cough you don't have a mic i have to mute mine all right so so we find then that it's it's it's redemption and it and it's going to bring the earth you know into back into its right order and you know there should be a passion i i think that there should be a passion in our lives you know to know the word of god to to not only know the theology of it friends but but there should be some kind of as paul said pressing toward the mark there should be a and that means straining reaching there should be a reaching to know him in the spirit there should be a reaching to know you're not here today just to get theology pumped into your heads i'm here to to show you christ in his word because he's a mystery that desires fellowship with his people and so there should be a fervent desire in our lives to please god brother branham comes in the church age book i don't i don't i didn't put it up on purpose because i didn't want to read too much uh from the screen but brother branham goes into the sumerian church age and then he repeats it again in the resume of the ages and he talks about how that learning has replaced revelation and reasoning has replaced faith and program listen to this one program has replaced spontaneous praise in the holy ghost all away with program we should have spontaneous praise in the presence of god not here looking for reasoning to replace my faith i'm not here to let program replaced spontaneous praise in the holy ghost he goes on how in the resume how that they the age became lukewarm and that's what the church has happened today that's that's the that's what god testified about laodicea the seventh and last age that you're in this was his testimony two thousand years before they came on the earth and he talks about brother bannon goes into the resume talking about how that they they just become lukewarm and and formal and when you become lukewarm and formal you know what happens you become powerless you have no power to overcome the devil you have no power to live a life above reproach you have no power in your prayer and i'm here to tell you this is an hour when you need to have power in your prayer this is an hour when you need to have a fellowship with god and brother branham would say that over and over perfect faith in different messages he would say now i'm bringing this you've had a faith but but there's coming a time i'm going to talk to you about a perfect faith because there's coming a time when you're going to need this and it's not going to come by theology and it's not just going to come because you're elected it's going to come because you have pressed forward that you have reached for the high calling that you have entered into a vibrant relationship with christ he said they become lukewarm and formal and powerless and many well he calls it well worked out explanations and prophet called it educated guesses of educated men how that they hold the ignorant in foodless pastures oh i'm no i think this bride is done with that she wants the revealed word of god hallelujah she doesn't just want to be a church member she's looking to ascend hallelujah and so we see these things happening you know they're in an age where we have such fear that has come upon the earth i'm going to try this i think it darkens that screen i thought it yeah it does we have such an age where fear has come into the world but but the prophet showed us that when the seven seals were open in the last day that what it one of the primary purposes that it came to do was take away fear how does it remove fear by removing doubts see because uncertainty brings anxiety and that's that's fear and and the whole world men's hearts are failing for not knowing the fear of the unknown and so now he has revealed not only his teaching but he has manifested his presence and that's why a prophet could say to you shalom bride good morning it is the darkest time the darkest day it's gross darkness on the people but here's the here's the ministry of the morning star arise shine thy light has come hallelujah so we find in the opening of the seals that have been people who have been chosen in christ how their names have been placed in the lamb's book of life and under no circumstances could any of those names ever be removed just say that to yourself and say it to the devil under no circumstances can those names be removed from the book of life under no circumstances so when the church comes you know to know who she is brother branham talked about satan will be powerless before her she'll be an invincible army he tells the the time the experience of coming and he's he's in a dream and he's three quarters of the way to jordan and it's and there's great fear and everybody's under fear and it's a great it's a great beast moving and he says when i saw it i recognized it as a mamba from africa he said they're very deadly one bite and you just are finished and and and i was just seeing uh the other day on a uh uh uh uh an animal documentary about the mamba and how that his bite can even take down a full grown bull elephant i saw it was so pitiful i saw a lion uh a a large lion taken and bitten by him and he began to convulse and shake and couldn't control his functions anymore and and through the night perishing and and and brother branham said the one bite of this that's a spiritual it's a time where the enemy has reached his zenith it's a time where he's the god of this evil age this is no time to be distant from christ you're gonna need to be close to him in this hour things are coming upon the earth and you're going to need to have thus saith the lord you're going to need to have a token that you can bring and show him and brother branham says shake it in front of his face i'm a son or daughter of god and the word of god gives me this privilege and i claim it in the name of jesus christ it'll go after your sickness in your body it'll go after your children who are in the world it'll restore everything because this is a message of redemption hallelujah it's a time of extreme fear and you must go on he was only i heard brother abraham preaching on this recently and how that you know brother branham is pointing out he's only two-thirds of the way the whole point was you must go on and and the and the real if there be a moral to the story is that if you don't if you don't go on if you don't move on in maturity if you you're you're living in such a time that if you stay carnal and you don't move on then the mamba well brother abraham said in his african way then the mamba will finish you here he'll destroy you now i'm here to tell you he'll take away from you everything you love he'll take away everything that you hold dear to your heart don't let that happen friend you're the bride of jesus christ hallelujah so we see these things as they begin to break upon the earth and i had a number of articles i was going to show you but they just were too sad and there's just been too many and when i you know i i started to show you the you know this shooting in this situation and before i before i could even come to show it to you they already had three four five six more and i was going to show you another one and then i'm going to show you two or three and now i'd have to show you half a dozen just since i started showing studying this the world is such a such a sad state i read an article about a you know and this is so typical it's not some big headline breaking story but i thought how typical it is of this world of irresponsibility where nobody takes responsibility nobody owns anything it's always somebody else's fault it's never you know everybody refuses blame and even large corporations get caught gaming the system and and and and they they have to come and and pay a fine which is a fraction of the of the billions they've tucked away breaking the law and they have to pay a little fine that doesn't even wouldn't even cover the interest they're earning but they admit no guilt yeah we'll pay your fine but we're not going to admit any guilt say yeah that's that's a corrupt government it's not just a corrupt government it's a government that knows that these corporations can hire dream teams of lawyers who are corrupt and can just work to move this thing on for years and so the government says look with a center you pay a fine and don't you do it again and and they won't until they do the world's done friends stop investing in it invest don't put treasures here put them up there hallelujah this world is passing away they talked about i seen a headline of this congressman got caught totally you know he was a complete adulterer and liar and swindler and and here he is has the audacity you need you need to resign from running i'm not going to resign well but you got caught red-handed that you were a crook and you were cheating on your wife and your family and you then you lied about it and then and then you even threatened this woman over here that if she said anything you would have her killed how can you not resign i'm not resigning he's still running today there's no shame there's no embarrassment brother branham said you can't even hardly get a girl to blush these days brother m tells a story of a little boy he says when i was a little boy i was on the playground in the school and he says we were out of the swing or the slide or something and he said a little girl out there in her long dress uh and he said she go to when to stand up and just the the bottom flap of her skirt just kind of flipped open and he said about a few inches of her petticoat which was also all the way down he said a few inches of her petticoat showed and she said all the boys seen it and said she turned several shades of red and all the boys turned away that's that sounds like a joke that's like that's like material a comedian would use to today in the modern day but that's where society was compared to where it is now they're not even embarrassed to be completely nasty and vulgar out in the open and you've got society going that way you've got the government passing laws to protect it i'm here to tell you friends that satan's eden and i i'm looking for a new heavens and a new earth i'm looking for a millennial reign with christ i read a story of a middle schooler middle school kid who may have his future trashed as far as it relates to universities and he was a he's a he's a a straight a student with high aspirations to ivy league schools but that's all been cast in doubt now because his middle school faculty went after him uh because that they because he didn't use a proper gender neutral pronoun it was an accident and he did it several times and he i'm sorry and they said you're doing that on purpose and his parents are saying look we raised him to look at a boy and say a boy and look at a girl and say that's a girl and this is a he and that's a herd and this is a hymn and that's a she and i'm sorry but he can't just turn that around overnight and they're actually trying to ruin his future because he refers to a girl as her i was preaching to you wednesday about the insanity the insanity the insanity see and so we find that you know he um when we start to look at these things and so so it's but now let me let me just say this let me just let me just come back to my thought it's all still under the perfect control of god there is nothing i know it looks like chaos but prophecy is driving it to the letter i know it looks like this thing's got out of got away from god and got out of control nothing doing i'm here to tell you the devil still runs nothing but his mouth and brother branham said he has no weapon only the only weapon he has is to get you to doubt your weapon i'm not going to doubt my weapon and i'm not going to doubt that i that i can move into a relationship with god so far so deep that satan can't even find me i believe that the holy spirit can anoint me and i can speak to something and it wouldn't matter what's hindering it it god's power of creation can turn it around hallelujah so beginning then to be seen at the turn of the 20th century judgments began to pick up steam in the earth this is all part of the unique hour that we have arrived at there's so many things as i've said to you so many things that are unique about the seventh and last age preach a whole sermon on it but not going to do that today we've talked about it before but we find that one of the things that make it unique is that bro that this age brother branham was identified by brother branham as unfolding under the under the beginning under the fourth trumpet which which was unfolding in history just prior to the turn of the 20th century and brother branham goes back to identify it because it was part of the depravity of the world the sun wouldn't shine the moon and the stars wouldn't give their light and brother branham says see there the world was turning away from the word christ is the sun the moon the church is going dark so so we already see the uh the under under the fourth trumpet and then and then when you come into the fifth trumpet then you find right around the turn of the century you've got an angel descending and given a key to the bottomless pit and to and brother branham takes that angel and ties him back to zechariah how art thou fallen from heaven o lucifer or isaiah son of the morning and shows that that angel that fell with the key to the bottomless pit was lucifer and he's been given now an extra power in the earth because now things are starting to pick up speed this thing is arriving to the seventh and final age the it won't be but just a few decades and god will be standing in a cave telling a prophet i'm going to sing you to the world with a ministry of divine healing amen and see so so now when satan has been given all this extra power and released all of these demons into the world then you've got god as i've said to you before and i'm repeating it you've got god back over here starting to inspire parnum and grant and lake and seymour and these guys and you've got the holy spirit pouring out on azusa street in los angeles because why when the enemy comes in like a flood god raises up a standard and then you're gonna move on from there and you're gonna find out that under the sixth trumpet then you're gonna find that the the the 200 million demons are released from euphrates that's history that's not a sixth trumpet on brother ram says all the trumpets sound under the sixth seal and the six seals tribulation so none of them sound till the tribulation wrong it's just that one is fullness one is partial just like the seals we have the full opening of the seals my brother adam says back in the ages the seal was partially opened and there was a and when they rejected it he dropped a temporary judgment a temporary plague that you can read about in its fullness coming under the seventh vial during the time of the tribulation period or whatever age the rejection was taking place you'd have a corresponding temporary partial judgment coming from that corresponding vial so i just want to keep all of that straight in your head i i started to draw it but i thought i can explain it better and just give you a uh let you have a visual image i'm happy to answer any questions if you're not quite catching it all right just try to try to stay with me so and and you're i'm sure you've noticed by now i say things and repeat them and i'm repeating things now i've already repeated and it's because that's how you're going to learn it the best is to constantly you'll finally you'll get to a point you'll you'll start to see the picture and it'll all start to make sense all right so just stay with it so now we find then that he he talks about how that through the fourth and the six trumpets with their correlating vials you're going to start seeing god move in the earth in the last age coming to the last laodicean age all right now i'm going to show you correlation all right this is correlation between the trumpets and the vials you'll notice revelation 8 7 the first angels sounded they're followed hail fire and mingled blood and they were cast where upon the earth and the third parts of the tree see a third part third a third see it's temporary it's in time it's not in the tribulation in the tribulation the the vial is going to be poured out in its fullness all right but now watch and so look here in the first vial and the first went and poured out his vile where upon the earth see and there fell annoys him and grievous swore upon men which had the mark of the beast and upon them which worshipped the image right you can track that all the way back into the church ages brother branham didn't do that i'm not going to try to do that because it would be presumptuous but what what you need to where it's really going to get important is when we get to the seventh one all you need to understand now is they were running hand in hand and these vials were playing out among the jews and among the gentiles partially all right watch second trumpet and the second angel sounded as it were a great mountain burning with fire all right remember the ages and seals uh relate to the gentiles trumpets are to the jews and the vials are the plagues that fall under both of them and the second angel sounded great mountain burning with fire was cast into the sea there are cataclysmic events that happened in history of the last 2000 years when i look at them and i look at some of these descriptions i go yeah that's probably a connection but i'm not going to preach that because i don't have the authority of a prophet and he didn't preach that all right all right so he said so we only want to be able to say what a prophet taught us and and anything i say i promise you can be supported in the quotes so he says a great mountain burning with fire cast in the sea and a third part of the sea became blood third part of the creatures were dead la and and had life died and the third part of the ships were destroyed revel now the second vial and the second angel poured out his vow where upon the sea because it correlates to the second trumpet all right third and the third angel sounded and there fell a great star from heaven burning as it were a lamp and it fell upon the third part of the rivers and fountains of waters and the name of the stars called wormwood in the third part here it is again third of the waters became wormwood and many men died of the waters because they made bitter third vial and the third angel poured out his vial upon where the rivers and fountains of waters see they became blood and it goes on and on and on and on trumpet four uh and the fourth angel sounded and the third part of the sun was smitten and the third part of the moon and the third part of the stars and when when brother branham is preaching on revelations uh chapter three chapter four chapter five he goes and starts interpreting these symbols even though he's not preaching on the trumpet he he he because some of this language appears in the ages also and brother branham gives us the universal meaning of it that you can apply and extrapolate throughout we'll see you'll see that in a few minutes and so it was smitten in the third part of the moon and the third part of the stars so as the third part of them was darkened and the day shown not for a third part of it and the night likewise now look at the fourth violin the fourth angel poured out his vile here it is upon the sun power was given unto him to scorch men with fire all right great heat they blasphemed god which had power over these plagues they repented not listen judgment comes for the purpose of repentance god is not maniacal sadistic he's not a troll he's not evil he doesn't he he he loves life he loves humanity he says to the world why will you die why will you not come to me and live no god doesn't send anybody to hell brother branham said anybody that goes to hell will have to fight every step of the way because god will try everything he can to block him so you say oh the judgment comes upon this situation or that situation or this church or that person just just rejoice because the judgment comes for repentance in the tribulation they can't repent but right now they still can repent hallelujah so he poured it up upon the sun fourth vial all right let's move on trumpet five the fifth angel sounded star here it is says lucifer fall from heaven unto the earth to him was given the key to the bottomless pit brother branham ties him right back to the old testament how are thou fallen from heaven lucifer son of the morning he opened the bottomless pit and there was a smoke of the pit as the smoke of a great furnace and the sun and the air were darkened by reason of the smoke of the pit under the vial and the fifth angel poured out his vial upon the seat of the beast and his kingdom was what here it is full of darkness and they gnawed their tongues for pain and blasphemed the god of heaven because of their pains and their sores and repented not of their deeds trumpet six and the sixth angel poured out his voice from the four horns of the golden altar which is before god saying to the sixth angel which had the trumpet loose the four angels which are bound in the great river euphrates now now you're coming to the book of revelation where you've got four angels standing on the winds of the earth controlling world war and the walls have have need the woes have just been waiting first world second world third woe which is going to bring the first world war the second world war and armageddon and and when the first woe starts through the earth it would have just went one two three and it would have just swept the earth clean of of all humanity but there came an angel who rose out of the east with the seal of the living god it showed it was christ because christ is the only one who can seal you oh hallelujah he comes with a seal of the living god and says wait i got children down there hold your horses hold up everything i gotta redeem him i gotta find him i gotta get a prophet and drop him down in an interval in a space of time between the sixth trumpet and the seventh trumpet and the sixth seal and the seventh seal i gotta send elijah and pull a pride out of there and then i gotta then the eagle's gonna lift up and the bride will go home and the eagle will fly east and pick up moses and elijah and he'll find my 144 thousand amen so he put he puts a temporary injunction on the prophecy see and so when he comes here into into into the vial see because here the the great river euphrates and those and so the those that's where you're going to get in in another place those 200 million chargers all right the six angel sits vial the sixth angel poured out his vial where upon the great river euphrates and the water there it was dried up that the way of the kings of the east might be prepared and the and all of the prophecy teachers think that's china that's nothing to do with china it's that it's because listen here's a good way to think of the vile the vile makes the way for the antichrist to take the next step so so when it's time for him to go after the jews we find waters dried up spiritually which release demons who are trapped there and they and now the antichrist has taken another step to do what annihilate god's people but it was all the tender hand of jehovah god was playing him the whole time oh my now we come we come to the seventh and i apologize it's so small i had to fit it all on one screen and the seventh angel sounded and there were great voices in heaven saying the kingdoms of this world are become the kingdoms of our lord and of his christ and he shall reign forever and ever and the four and twenty elders which sat before god on their seats fell upon their faces and worshiped god saying we give thee thanks move that curse of please we give thee thanks lord god almighty which art and was and art to come because thou has taken to thee thy great power and has reigned and the nations were angry and thy wrath is common the time of the dead that they should be judged and that thou should just give reward unto thy servants the prophets and to the states and them that fear thy name small and great and should us destroy them which destroy the earth now watch verse 19 and the temple of god was opened in heaven and there were seen in his temple the ark of his testament and there were lightnings and voices and thunderings and an earthquake and great hail those five things along with the with the ark of the testament now look at the vial and the seventh angel poured out his vial where into the air now here's where we've been showing you that temporary portion amen all right now i'm gonna i'm gonna i'm gonna connect it just carry on because we see that happening temporarily now before we go into the tribulation and it is that it is that thing released into the air that brings satan's eden and causes the world to go insane see watch now and i'm going to prove it so let's hold on the seven things are poured out as violent into the air and there came a great voice out of the temple of heaven from the throne saying it is done now watch verse 18 and there were voices and thunders and lightnings and there was a great earthquake such as was not since men were upon the earth so mighty an earthquake this is the earthquake that brother branham ties back to the old testament prophecy i believe in ezekiel or jeremiah can't remember that this is jerusalem the city will people think it's rome all revelation teachers think that's rome being divided into three parts not rome gets burned with nuclear fire rome gets torched by atomic radiation jerusalem breaks into three parts and that's where the mount of olives begins to break up right there in jerusalem to create because because when brother branham is preaching the in the uh the future home he uses the same scripture of a holy mountain to describe the millennium and the new heavens and the new earth so there is going to be a headquarters in the millennium there's not going to be the city john saw but there is going to be palaces and there is going to be government there is going to be his family and priests and kings ruling and reigning with christ a thousand years so so we find then there's this great earthquake so i don't see it as being california because brother branham thought we would see california and we certainly don't see jerusalem broke into three parts so he so i think california's the fulfillment of matthew 27 and 28 on the on resurrection morning the graves of them which slept arose uh and oh because there was two earthquakes there was an earthquake on good friday in matthew 27 and brother branham says the events of matthew 27 repeat at the end time and that's why when brother branham just like the seventh vial brother branham throws a rock up into the air and says judgment striking the west coast and the judgments under the seventh vial begin with alaska and it's going to move and move and move and move and it's going to take california out and it's causing the madness that you see in the world and it starts with the last guy and moves all the way and the bride goes home the the stops are all pulled out satan's wagon and that church following a witch goes off into the abyss but the bride is marching upward hallelujah oh my now so he says and every island fled away in the mountains were not found and there fell upon me in a great hail see all of those signs under the seventh trumpet are in the vile weighing about a talent men blasphemed god because of the plague of the hail for the plague thereof was exceeding great so when it's falling in its fullness all they can do is blaspheme see there's no way brother branham says no one is saved during the millennium the unwise virgin are not saved in the millennium she's already saved but she goes into the tribulation to be purged for her sin of unbelief and rejecting the message see and so so he's he's purging he's purging the remnant he's purging israel and he's purging the earth during the millennium now all right let me pause right there all right hang on you good man i don't see anybody's ears smoking yet so we're we're good amen brother joe give me a thumbs up if brother joe is good we should all be good amen praise the lord so so when you go now and so you know and you and and as i said to those who might be listening to this you you have to go to everything brother branham taught because it it takes it takes a lot of study and and countless hours and and midnight oil over years to get the full picture so you know brother branham translates what voices and thunderings and lightnings are but he doesn't preach a sermon called the seventh vial where he interprets it where he interprets it is back when he's preaching revelation chapter 3. and there brother branham comes in and says you notice in here it was not a mercy seat for there was lightnings and thunder and voices there's no there there's no lightning and thunders at mercy that's judgment see so lightnings thunder and voices so so then now so out of the throne is lightning and thunder so now because why this is the time where we've entered into judgment now in the tribulation it's all full complete judgment right now you're seeing life and death go forward right now you're seeing a word that can give life to believe it and at the same time god will issue an indictment to the age it's a unique time that's never happened before see and so we find that john is being taken forward here and and and you you if you want to go home and read that that's revelation 4 5 and out of the throne proceeded lightnings and thunderings and voices and there were seven lamps of fire burning before the throne which are the seven spirits of god so now watch so now you've got all your messengers you've got your judgment lightnings your judgment thunders you've got your voices of the of the messengers see so out of the throne is lightning and thunder and john now in revelation 4 is being taken forward in time and he's literally moved into where where what's revelation 4 the rapture cycle so he we we've been caught up out of the age god closed off a church age now not an eighth age it's a it's an age within an age it's a bright age contained in the last age and that's why brother branham said it's now the time of the word and the word only now word and word only does not mean word no spirit it doesn't mean that at all it just simply is saying that everything we believe is only the word that now i'm throwing out all man-made ideology all man-made ideas all organized religion and the bride has thus saith the lord or she says nothing in other words everything she says is thus saith the lord by a prophet see but you don't discount the spirit it's the spirit that gives life to the word amen see so we find then that the throne so john now here is seeing this rapture cycle he's taken into the heavenly realm he's looking at what is taking place there and the throne of course represents a judgment throne as brother branham showed it's not a not a throne of mercy see there they then then here's seven lamps of fire burning before that throne which are the seven spirits of god so now here's the voices as brother brennan would say the voice of judgment what is it the voice of the ministers down through the ages who cried through the holy spirit see so now you've got these voices you've got christ speaking through his messengers and once the messenger watch this now i'm going to show you another unique point once the messenger was was taken from the earth then what does history teach us what did brother branham prove in the church ages that they denominated the movement amen am i right how many how many message readers when the messenger was taken here you've got these seven messengers these seven spirits of god god's not seven persons it's god speaking through messengers and so we find that when that messenger is taken from the earth then they denominate the movement by disbelieving the word for their age and its messenger and this then releases a temporary judgment into the earth under the correlating vial correlating to that age and that messenger partially temporarily you see so now we're at the seventh age now we've come down to the seventh age and this age now here's a unique thing this age didn't have to uh wait if i could put it that way every age they had to wait till the messenger ran his course and was taken and then they denominated and that was it in the in the age that we that we live in we find that that we that that we didn't have to wait until the messenger left because his ministry is the ministry of pointing to the messenger in the latter rain which is christ and that's why he says at the end i'll give you the former rain and i'll give you the latter rain but then there's going to come a time i'm going to pour the former rain and the latter rain out in the same month and and the reapers will overtake the sowers oh do you understand friends who who are who i mean i mean the sowers overtake the reapers because the sowers for the next ages moses and elijah and the reapers who are still in the field trying to gather the harvest of the pride and you've already got judgments moving in and messengers ready to go and god's ready to get a move on and the pride is getting ready and you've got these you've got this anointing saying to you bride hey clear the field go in the rapture get out of here we gotta sow for the next event that's the hour that we live in friends you're being pushed out of here by the anointing of the holy spirit i feel the pull it's drawing me somewhere so we find then that that he's pointing to the messenger the seventh angel points to the messenger in the latter ring because that's christ he didn't bring people to himself we and branham didn't do that people who say he did are lying that's a false accusation he actually never did that he pointed people to christ constantly see and so he he's pointing to the messenger and the latter raid which is the identified christ of all ages and this is exactly now this is exactly why that that that when he when he comes to declare the identified christ in all the ages that he can he can say i indict this generation in the presence of the judge so now there's been a transition now seals have been opened the mighty angel has descended down the open book has been given to the messenger who's then given it to the people why because the ministry of the son of man has to be restored in the church not just the office of son of man paul held the office of son of man jesus walked in the office of son of man but the ministry of the son of man is that word made flesh in people and when the holy ghost came in the upper room that became the ministry the continuation of jesus christ the ministry of the son of man the word made flesh and what did they do they opened blinded eyes they raised the dead they healed the lame they preached the gospel they walked out of prison hallelujah and that's what the last day messenger was to bring back he was to bring back the office of son of man therefore christ could come down and through that message come into his church and once again we have the ministry of the son of man the word made flesh in a pride at the last day no wonder satan is afraid of you no wonder he fears you no wonder he attacks you see so the judgments did did not need to wait until the age ended the indictment came and the judgments began to fall ah while elijah was still sounding starting in alaska they didn't need to wait until the age ended in the tribulation because the last part of the seventh age is a bright age which never ends the kingdoms of this world revelation 11 the kingdoms of this world have become the kingdoms of our lord and of his christ that's not true lord that's not teaching to lord doctrine that's teaching christ and his bride it's become the kingdoms of our lord and of his anointed family see so brother branham identifies that as his bride so we find then that lightnings and thunderings and voices now here's a beautiful part i'll probably have to close here because i'm just flat out of time and i'm not going to be able to finish not going to be able to even get to my pause place but it's okay all right all right thanks moe all right now that's about what i need i'm i can finish a few a few minutes inside of that so now listen friends here's something to put a shot in your arm lightnings and thunderings and voices also represent deliverance to god's people because when god called israel out of egypt in the first exodus and now here we are in the third exodus and when god called israel out of egypt under the first exodus there were lightnings and there were thunderings and there were voices and it was judgment to egypt but it was deliverance to israel it was a coming out of oh my friends because there were there those of god's family who right while the judgments were pouring out they were safe in goshen hallelujah while the world was in darkness goshen had light while the world was suffering the loss of their firstborn israel was under a token hallelujah oh my friend so we we see then the giving of life with this message in this bright age at this hour we see the giving of life and the releasing of judgment under an indictment simultaneously amen see that's unique it's simultaneous because it's the ministry of the son of man again see and we're we're living right in the big middle of it it's judgment to a dying world but to the bride it's the power of transformation hallelujah it's the power of transformation it's judgment to the world it's darkness to the world but arise shine shalom bright arise shine my light has come hallelujah you know let me just let me just turn a corner i i want to try to get to this part and no i'm still going to stay within my time just watch so now you're going to find that no members and i and i can say this authoritatively because i grew up you know in the age after the prophet was gone and i i you know i always tried to position myself near preachers feeling as a little boy someday i would do that and you know when brother eddie was having deep discussions you know i was always with an ear listening you know discussing it with other ministers and brother eddie was kind of on the inside of things because he was personal deep deep very close personal friends with perry green very personal friends of oliveio and uh very very personal friends with brother collins at the tabernacle there and and going there as a child gave me some inside track and i can just tell you friends and then as i grew up and began to minister myself you know there was no member of the fivefold ministry or even even dare i say a prophet in his day that thought we would still be here this side of eternity now yeah it's it's you know there was a there was a unanimous around the world no one who followed the the teachings of god's prophet not even brother branham now i got to say it like this brother branham knew we could be and he said that he said that very clearly he said i could miss it many miles he said it might go on another 100 years and i just thought to myself you know i remember years ago in the in the late 80s and how crazy the world was then which looked like nothing compared to now and the 80s look and the 80s made the 60s look like nothing and so it's just gotten worse and it got impossibly worse until it couldn't get any worse and then it did and that's where we are and i'm here to tell you it'll continue to get worse say i can't imagine it's already beyond what you can imagine you couldn't imagine five years ago where we'd be now with the laws that they're passing and the and the the the attitude and the social fabric of the nation and of the world it's it's it's madness it's it's crazy we look at it and we go has everybody just lost their mind they have see and so the only thing that's held us in check is the mind of christ see that's why i was saying one time about things old-fashioned and you know the only the only reason something got old-fashioned is because time progressed and they changed at one time here was a certain style and women the women all dressed in dresses and modest and and nothing you know showing and decent and modest and men were tipped their hat and didn't curse in public and and didn't even spit in front of a woman and you say oh that's old-fashioned well that's only old-fashioned cause time kept going and people backslid that didn't change the fact that there's still decency it didn't change the fact you see so i i'm i'm interested in the in the in the word i don't care about the style i want the word because the style will always and what's old is new and what goes around will come right back around again and you you chase that stuff you'll go nuts you'll spend a third of your income just trying to keep up with fashions and styles don't do it hallelujah put on what you like what looks comfortable and what keeps you decent modest and a testimony of jesus christ let the world go crazy don't go crazy with them see so brother branham knew it could go on ministers knew it could the bride certainly i think i speak for us all the bride wanted to be long gone long ago you know um 50 plus years ago yeah i mean i thought this morning how i would love to be 50 years deep into the millennium right now man about how to run away when i thought about that and i started getting excited i thought how i would love to be 50 years deep into the millennium still at 950 years to go but those first 50 have been epic and here we are still this side of eternity see and just as god i say well brother jason can you speak to that i think i can at least it and what helps me when i rationalize it i realize you know by by teaching that god brother brown talks about how that god wouldn't allow the early church to know it's going to be you know they they thought he him his coming is imminent he didn't let him know brother brown talks about that he didn't let him know it's going to be 2 000 more years because that would have discouraged him see you always want to live with the imminency of he's coming soon he's coming soon and so so that that that that's helpful so the cup of iniquity but we found the cup of iniquity you know would have to be full and i i just want to i just want to give this plug for god can i do that the cup of iniquity we would have loved to have been gone 50 years ago but but the cup of iniquity of fallen man would have to be full before a god of boundless mercy would finally end the gospel era to the gentiles and i'm here to tell you something friends he is a god of mercy and the bible says don't don't count as slackness just because the lord is delaying that's what you might count as slackness he said but to god it's not slackness but god is tenderhearted and merciful trying to give everybody a chance see so he's trying to find and redeem the last name in the lamb's book of life and call his bride home and then of course that dreadful time of jacob's trouble uh would set in and six thousand year human journey would come to a come around its final bend and uh finishing out its last 42 months when you're gone you say the clocks stop when we're gone no they actually just start 42 months and counting and every day they wake up it's one day less 42 months and counting and so we found that that what god that and brother branham was showing us that the two things now now we're going back to to rehearse what we learned and i think part one and partially in part two that the two things that brother branham showed us that would lead the church to armageddon one would be the trinity doctrine those three unclean spirits like frogs so so that that doesn't even come until you find that coming in the in the vials and so brother branham shows that it's coming between the sixth and seventh vial and that's already been and brother branham said that that look those frogs look back all the way back to when to babylon see and and it looks back to rome and rome looks back to babylon so you've got the same devil operating all the time only now it's coming into prophecy and we find at the last days that the trinity doctrine is going to give a power of solidarity to the religious world to bring them against you and i and it doesn't matter that your lives are holy and decent and righteous and you don't lie you don't kill you don't beat your wives you don't drink you don't do drugs you pay your bills you keep your word you're a good citizen and they hate you see i'm not i'm not talking about your hated universally i got plenty of friends who love and respect me i'm talking about the the beast system the demon powers that that control and and and i'm here to tell you something friends uh what according to bible prophecy the whole world will run after him whose names are not in the lamb's book of life you say well i got i got i know a lot of nice people that would never do that listen i don't care what you think about those nice people when demon power takes over their mind the bible says that they as a unified body of humanity will murder moses and elijah murder the 144 thousand and murder the unwise virgin they will slaughter them they will all be martyred during that time and a lot of nice people now won't be so nice then see and i would say in that time the only nice ones left will be the remnant of the woman's seed as far as gentiles are concerned and and the 144 thousand that's just a a drop in the bucket compared to the humanity so the whole world is going after that don't don't be naive and think scripture's not gonna like scripture you don't know what it's talking about scripture has never been wrong see and so then the second thing that would lead the whole world was worldly entertainment now brother branham used the term rock and roll and when he saw a witch which represented the head of the church puts the nuts because remember it's a tr it's a it's a it's a triunity of religious political and demon power all right coming together and though the church is being led by a religious witch that goes all the way back to the pope see because the bible says through his sorceries see and it's witchcraft because rebellion against god and and brother branham in the 60s could only call it rock and roll now we've actually because we're still here 50 plus years later now we've had to actually broaden the term not adding to brother branham's words but there was a lot of things there were you know now we've got to say we've got to say rock and roll and then you've got to divide classic and then you've got to divide pop and then you've got to divide rap and then you've got to divide country and then you've got to divide this and that and then you've got to divide grunge and then you've got to really call it punk and then you've got to i mean the the the categories go on and on and on and on and now you had hollywood just really getting started when brother branham talks about that they swap around one another committing adultery you know uh and and that was just that that now you're in the days where you've got cary grant and grace kelly and it looks it looks innocent now it's it's so vulgar even the commercials i i hope no one in here is a is a is a a routine tv watcher i know you might be in a hospital and they got it playing or you might be in a my wife went to the dentist and they got it playing in front of her thankfully it's hg it's showing you know cooking shows and rebuilding houses and i appreciated the dentist for that but i mean let's face it friends the world is nasty and vulgar and perverted and now even the commercials are promoting the the homosexual agenda promo promoting all uh you know cross-racial barriers and and and i'm not not complaining against that but why are they constantly putting it in our face because hollywood nashville motown new york where it's at paris france london england moscow russia it doesn't matter the whole world the religious world is being led by a trinity of devils father son and holy ghost under a false prophet a beast and a dragon and we find that the power of world now i've got to expand the term to worldly entertainment driven by demons now for 40 years former soviet soviet union the uh with with all of their soviet union satellite states for 40 years held people under communism where they could not you know let me just come to the part that's really that i noticed personally when we first started going into russia brother lonnie and i started going together and then brother eugene started coming along then later brother barry started coming along and and and and now brother barry's still going back in there even to this day i haven't been in years uh probably five years ago i was in moscow preaching revivals for brother sergey and that's the meeting where we saw as he yet spake these words the holy ghost started falling on the people people were being healed of diseases i never prayed for a person just while i preached young people being filled with the holy ghost on the spot people under depression and darkness and beginning getting free men coming in off the street here just hearing me read a scripture fall down and repent see just like just like in the just like the house of cornelius that the book of acts again as peter yet spake these words the holy ghost fell and so so we but one of the things that we find when we went there is they were so stoic that you you no matter what you said it was difficult on us especially me as a southern preacher brother lonnie was yankee it was a little easier on him but it was hard on me as a southern because i like i like to hear some amens i like to hear some pull you know and and you you i mean you bring your best material and you'd wow and they just sit there and we thought what is wrong with these people but what we learned to discover now they're not like that now now they'll jump through the roof and land out in the road but but then they were 40 years under communism and they were taught to not be expressive it was it was against the law they'd take you aside and question you if you acted out in public see and so so we we learned that they were just locked down and frozen so so then you can imagine what a revival began to break among the people when when perestroika and glasnost and and gorbachev and yeltsin begin they tore down the berlin wall and and and commune the soviet union collapsed and you had cosmonauts who were part of the ussr when they went into space and when they came home they were ussr didn't even exist anymore they're part of the russian federation and so they they held a revival in in in moscow right shortly after the uh after all of that came down it's 1991 and they they held a revival and you can see when the people who have who have been taught there was no god there is no god they didn't know the first thing about worshiping god and finally now the gospel is starting to go in and and and and things are starting to progress and the people are so excited to hear uh the things of god that they assembled in moscow 1991 almost two million people almost 2 million people the excitement was palpable they're there i mean you're going to even see american and even dixie flags wave look at the mass of humanity it's as far as you can see and one point it starts waving there's a russian helicopter going over i mean these people are excited to be free now they can worship like they've never been able to worship before and even their soldiers there that's a profile of a soldier you can see the people are so excited and watch them now you're even going to see the soldiers even finally can't resist anymore and and even the soldiers start jumping up and down and and worshipping and these people are so sincere look at those raising their hands and oh lifting up glory and praise and their there's your soldiers and the only problem was that it they weren't worshiping the god that you and i would normally worship and they'll be led by the trinity and rock and roll to armageddon you think you think that that rock and roll won't lead the world look at that you think rock and roll doesn't have that kind of power to make people look at this soldier right here he's he's lost it now he's taking his uniform off i mean this this was this was just me this here they are and i i titled that screen false anointed ones 40 years under communism this is what broke my heart broke brother's heart 40 years under communism and as soon as those walls collapsed trinitarian churches ran in took up all the real estate started started persecuting the believers tried to hold us back from witnessing questioned us at checkpoints and wanted to know come into our meetings i'm told in certain meetings i have to keep my voice low i go into belarus and and i'm preaching in an apartment to probably 20 people and i'm trying not to get excited and every time i get excited the pastor's saying there's people outside listening and if they hear us in a service they'll call in so we said well we better go and have a secret meeting in the woods and we did and we got busted and the border guards come rushing in what took everybody to jail but god in his sovereignty when i got out of the out of the van they left to go get some old ladies and i left my bible left my notebook i left everything and i couldn't start preaching until they got back with the old women and before they got back with them here come the border guards and so no preaching was going on but i would have been wide open and i'd went straight to jail the pastor went to jail he told me that he said you'd went to jail i'd went to jail and everybody here women and children would have went to jail and they finally when we told them we're just here singing some songs and they looked at everybody's passports and and they left and then i get on a train and i've got to cross the russian frontier to get back to moscow and suddenly the train's not leaving and they're knocking they're knocking on our window and the brother brother vitali goes and he opens the curtain and the pastor's you know and vitali leaves and and he locks the door he says brother jason something's wrong don't talk don't speak english leave this door locked if somebody knocks don't answer it and he went and they said the kgb had boarded the train because this is belarus they're still russian they're still uh communist and he's and they're looking for someone and so they they hit me in this car with the door locked wouldn't let me even utter a word and we drove across the russian frontier through the night i made it back into the federation of russia i'm going to tell you something friends and this is this is now satan in control if satan can do that if satan can do that to people who never did that for 40 years then you think the trinity and rock and roll worldly entertainment ain't gonna somehow lead them to armageddon i'm here to tell you something friends it not only will it already is this is the hour that we have arrived at the taking back of every everything that we lost god is redeeming it back to his bride you are living in the last closing scenes of human history and we'd love to have been 50 years deep in the end of the millennium but you know this word had to be lived it had to be lived do you know do you know why they wrote a book of acts i've said it to you before why they write a book of acts because people acted and i'm here to tell you what what vindicated william branham was it his theology no it was his life of the supernatural and his life as an overcomer and maintaining victory and they could never move him from that and his life proved that what the bible said would happen when elijah came he did it i'm here to tell you the the old testament prophesied what would happen in the in jerusalem in the upper room it prophesied what would happen jesus prophesied that that his life would be lived continually through them i'm here to tell you we'd have all liked to have been gone 50 years in the millennium but he wasn't coming back to marry a little girl she was barely walking when a prophet went home hallelujah she had to she had to go through this because the world was going to get worse and much worse and worse still and then even worse still but there had to be a bride who walked through it and stayed in the step of the gospel and stands today a regal bride ready for christ to meet christ in the air she's she's refused all man-made systems she doesn't want the fashions and styles of the world she wants holiness and righteousness she wants to see the power of the risen christ living through her listen friends that it's those it's those evil spirits it's those same evil spirits that that try to drive our young sisters into dressing him immodestly just remember sisters the same devil's doing that it's the same one that want to make our brothers irresponsible and corrals and do things that they shouldn't be doing it's the same devil i'm here to tell you i i i'm just saying lord god give me
