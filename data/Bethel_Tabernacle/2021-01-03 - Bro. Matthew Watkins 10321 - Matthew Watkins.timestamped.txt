[0:00] those again do we believe that this
[0:01] morning even so them
[0:04] also which sleep in jesus
[0:07] will god bring with him for this we say
[0:10] unto you
[0:10] by the word of the lord that we which
[0:13] are alive and remain unto the coming of
[0:16] the lord
[0:17] shall not prevent them which are asleep
[0:21] for the lord himself shall descend from
[0:24] heaven notice the distinction
[0:26] this is in a priest a prophet a king
[0:29] this is the lord
[0:30] himself brother branham said christ does
[0:32] all of it
[0:33] the shout the voice the trump all of it
[0:36] he does
[0:38] when he descends notice let's read it
[0:39] again for the lord himself shall descend
[0:42] from heaven
[0:43] with the shout with the voice of the
[0:45] archangel
[0:46] and with the trump of god and the dead
[0:49] in christ
[0:50] shall rise first then
[0:53] we which are alive and remain shall be
[0:57] called up together with them in the
[0:59] clouds
[1:00] to meet the lord in the air and so shall
[1:03] we
[1:03] ever be with the lord wherefore comfort
[1:06] one another
[1:08] with these words you can be seated this
[1:10] morning
[1:12] we know that from the as we spoke last
[1:15] time on this that that
[1:17] verse 17 and you can just pull that back
[1:20] up brother kevin
[1:21] says then we we which are alive and
[1:23] remain shall be called up now we know
[1:26] that that the the word that we use
[1:29] there uh the english word that we use
[1:31] rapture
[1:32] you won't find it here in first
[1:34] thessalonians 4 you won't find it in
[1:36] first corinthians 15. it actually comes
[1:39] from
[1:40] the latin version of the bible and the
[1:43] word is
[1:44] if i was just to pronounce it would be
[1:45] rapturo or something like that
[1:48] it sounds very similar to the word
[1:49] rapture that's where we get the word
[1:52] rapture so people who say that rapture
[1:53] is not in the bible
[1:55] well that's not necessarily true it
[1:56] actually is in the bible
[1:58] just not that english word rapture but
[2:00] the latin rap
[2:01] rapture is in there but the greek the
[2:04] hebrew word the in the greek word that
[2:06] is used here actually is
[2:08] harpazo which means when it says we
[2:10] shall be
[2:11] called up that word means to be
[2:15] snatched that's what if you click on the
[2:17] word and that's exactly what it says to
[2:19] be snatched
[2:20] and we know what that means to snatch
[2:22] something out of someone's hand to
[2:24] snatch something away
[2:26] and this is what the the the bible is
[2:29] trying to convey here that
[2:30] we which are alive and remain shall be
[2:33] snatched we shall be
[2:34] called up together with them in the
[2:37] clouds
[2:38] to meet the lord in the air and so shall
[2:41] we ever be with the lord
[2:43] now what you'll find here distinctively
[2:45] in the bible
[2:46] when you study it is that you're going
[2:48] to see that there are certain
[2:50] scriptures that pertain to to the bible
[2:53] says christ
[2:54] coming in in his glory we know that
[2:56] there's a lot of things that you're
[2:58] going to
[2:58] read about that pertain to separate uh
[3:02] time it's the same timeline but separate
[3:05] events
[3:05] along that timeline because the bible
[3:08] speaks very clearly about the great
[3:10] tribulation
[3:11] and it speaks about um in the
[3:14] great as we're teaching here this
[3:15] morning it speaks of a great tribulation
[3:18] period and the bible says that there's
[3:21] never was a day
[3:22] like it and there's never going to be
[3:24] another day like it it's going to be the
[3:26] day
[3:27] of the lord and we don't uh we don't
[3:30] we we wouldn't uh we would never try to
[3:33] convey that
[3:34] that we know everything uh in a in a
[3:38] uh in a chronological sense uh because
[3:41] even myself
[3:42] i remember maybe two or three months ago
[3:44] actually back in february this year i
[3:45] had something upon my heart
[3:47] that i created a document and and i
[3:49] started putting a document i still have
[3:51] it
[3:51] putting it together called what happens
[3:53] next and i was
[3:55] i was my attempt my ambition i should
[3:58] say
[3:59] was to uh to chronologically lay out
[4:02] what happens
[4:03] next in time we know certain things that
[4:06] are coming we're waiting for the rapture
[4:08] waiting for the body change there's the
[4:09] millennium there's the
[4:10] great white throne judgment there's the
[4:12] resurrection
[4:14] so all of those things i was trying i
[4:15] was going to lay out in order
[4:18] and i and i sort of tied myself in
[4:21] in knots trying to do it and what i
[4:23] realized the lord
[4:24] stopped me i had so many things together
[4:26] and then questions about this
[4:28] and the lord holy spirit to stop me and
[4:30] and just re
[4:31] just told me um you're not going to be
[4:34] able to do this
[4:36] because i've i don't want you to be able
[4:38] to list
[4:39] every little thing and every spot and
[4:42] every
[4:42] every little uh line that you could mark
[4:45] for the timeline because
[4:47] some of it is a mystery and brother
[4:50] branham says how does god interpret his
[4:52] word
[4:53] how does god interpret his word come on
[4:55] you message students here brother
[4:56] branham said how does thank you
[4:58] he brings it to pass god interprets his
[5:02] own word by
[5:03] bringing it to pass and so we would be
[5:07] uh we would be out of the line in order
[5:10] of god's word to try to put
[5:11] and that doesn't mean we don't know
[5:13] something but to try to put a
[5:15] chronological event for
[5:16] every single thing i don't think god
[5:18] really intended it to be that way
[5:21] there are certain portions as we've said
[5:23] many times that apply
[5:24] specifically to you there are certain
[5:27] things that
[5:28] that apply generically to the entire
[5:30] mystical body of christ
[5:31] and there are certain things that don't
[5:33] apply to us in any way
[5:34] shape or form i
[5:38] i put together a document brother kevin
[5:39] you can go ahead and bring that up
[5:41] because we're just going to look at it
[5:42] here
[5:42] just for a moment and i want to read to
[5:45] you i didn't get a chance to do this
[5:48] wednesday i got to some of them and ran
[5:51] out of time
[5:52] so this is going to be a lot of reading
[5:54] but i want you to
[5:55] i want you just to pay attention i've
[5:57] got it on the screen the first
[5:59] document i sent you brother kevin and
[6:01] you could make that just as big
[6:02] uh maybe if you could make it bigger
[6:04] it'd be probably better
[6:06] can you see that brother jason to mars
[6:07] in the back can you see that okay maybe
[6:09] a little bit a little bit bigger if you
[6:10] could
[6:11] brother kevin maybe command plus i think
[6:14] yeah
[6:14] if you can you may even have to scroll
[6:17] left and right but that's fine
[6:19] i want you to listen close because this
[6:21] i believe is very important because it
[6:23] sets
[6:24] our expectation on the right things
[6:28] because if we're not careful paul's that
[6:30] just for a moment because everyone's
[6:31] reading the head
[6:33] if we're not careful when we have the we
[6:36] we
[6:37] when you have the false when you have a
[6:39] false expectation or maybe not even a
[6:41] false expectation
[6:43] but a lot of times there's great amount
[6:45] of fear
[6:46] in what you don't know right
[6:50] so what you don't know there's a lot of
[6:52] well i've heard this and what about this
[6:54] over here and then there's this
[6:56] brother branham said this over here
[6:57] about the squeeze and then he talks
[6:59] about
[7:00] over in this place about how that
[7:01] persecution will come and run us
[7:03] together then
[7:04] i heard this brother a lot of times what
[7:06] you'll realize when
[7:07] if you were to if you were to be able to
[7:11] narrow down you say well didn't brother
[7:13] branham say this if you were able to
[7:14] trace that back
[7:16] and trace it all the way back to where
[7:18] that thought got put in your mind
[7:20] it was most of the time it's never
[7:23] actually you
[7:24] reading something that the prophet said
[7:26] or something that you heard brother
[7:28] branham say
[7:29] but usually it's it's laced in with this
[7:32] brother said this and this preacher over
[7:34] here said this and this teacher said
[7:36] this and then you sort of piece it all
[7:37] together
[7:39] and you know what you have you still
[7:40] don't really know you just didn't didn't
[7:42] this say this and
[7:43] aren't this and what that what that will
[7:46] bring is
[7:46] an unnecessary fear
[7:50] so we don't want unnecessary fear when
[7:52] we can
[7:53] know right
[7:56] we're teaching here and i titled this
[7:57] this morning the purge
[7:59] listen what brother adam says in the
[8:00] seventh seal brother kevin if you want
[8:02] to bring that up
[8:03] he says the first thing
[8:06] the first thing was that the sleeping
[8:09] virgin
[8:10] had to go through the tribulation period
[8:12] for
[8:13] purification for purification
[8:18] she had to be purged of her sins
[8:21] of unbelief and rejecting the message
[8:25] now this is not the heathen this is
[8:28] not the unjust this is not the the
[8:31] sinner
[8:31] brother branham says this is that notice
[8:33] the beginning this is that sleeping
[8:35] virgin the foolish virgin
[8:38] and he said they were to be purged this
[8:40] was the point
[8:41] of the tribulation period there's a
[8:44] purpose for the millennium
[8:46] and it has to do with you and me and
[8:49] there's a purpose for the tribulation
[8:51] and it has to do with the foolish virgin
[8:53] it doesn't have to do with me or you
[8:55] there's something god is going to
[8:57] accomplish in the millennium and that's
[8:59] rest
[8:59] that's restoration for you and for me
[9:03] but then there's something he's wanted
[9:04] to accomplish in the tribulation period
[9:07] she had to be purged for her sins of
[9:09] unbelief and rejecting the message
[9:11] this she was done in the tribulation
[9:14] period so what what again just to make
[9:16] it crystal clear
[9:18] the purpose of the tribulation period
[9:20] was for purification and for purging
[9:23] for sins of unbelief and rejecting
[9:26] the message we're at the end
[9:30] you can just follow with me we're at the
[9:32] end
[9:33] and we see that we're and we see we're
[9:35] at the end there's
[9:36] no there's not no way to build upon the
[9:39] corruption how can we build a city upon
[9:41] the charred ruins
[9:42] of a sodom and gomorrah how can we do it
[9:45] there's only
[9:46] one phoenix left and that's the coming
[9:49] of the lord
[9:50] jesus now that's a group follow me
[9:53] that's a group the coming of the lord
[9:55] jesus encompasses
[9:56] many different things one of them is the
[9:58] rapture
[9:59] one of them is the catching away that's
[10:02] why i said you'll find in your bible
[10:03] there's certain scriptures where it
[10:05] talks about
[10:05] christ coming with the saints and then
[10:07] he comes in all of his glory and then
[10:09] every eye
[10:10] shall see him but then the bible also
[10:13] talks it would be
[10:14] it would be contradicting itself if the
[10:16] come if the second coming of the lord
[10:18] the tribulation period and the rapture
[10:21] were all just
[10:22] the same exact thing then it would be
[10:23] contradictory because you'll also find
[10:25] scriptures where the bible says
[10:27] that he comes like a thief in the night
[10:33] he comes like a thief in the night well
[10:35] how do you reconcile that with him
[10:36] coming in his glory in every eye
[10:38] and every tongue shall confess not the
[10:40] same exact happening not the same exact
[10:44] time
[10:46] he comes like a thief in the night now
[10:47] remember he's not a thief
[10:50] he's not coming as a thief that you got
[10:52] to be careful how you apply this
[10:54] because you don't you don't steal
[10:56] something that already belongs to you
[10:59] and i already belong to him so you
[11:02] already been purchased by him so he's
[11:04] not coming as a thief to steal something
[11:06] because
[11:07] he's all he's doing is claiming what's
[11:09] already his
[11:11] but to the world it will be like a thief
[11:14] because what does a thief do you look
[11:16] around
[11:17] something that was there's gone suddenly
[11:18] it's vanished so the bible says he comes
[11:21] like to the world like a thief
[11:24] in the night listen he says we're at the
[11:26] end and that's the coming lord jesus
[11:28] my he says a purification
[11:31] let me find my place a purification
[11:34] through the tribulation period
[11:36] to bring back a restoring of a world
[11:40] for a people who are just in the sight
[11:43] of god
[11:43] and live by his word what is the purpose
[11:46] of the tribulation period
[11:48] purging and what is also being purged
[11:53] is the earth that's why the
[11:56] brother madam says what does he do he he
[11:59] he it's just
[12:00] water blood and spirit he's already we
[12:02] already know that noah's
[12:03] uh ark we already know that the flood of
[12:05] noah's day he already
[12:07] washed it baptized it with water
[12:10] right his blood spilled upon the earth
[12:12] when he was crucified
[12:14] now what's left a fiery baptism
[12:18] and that's why the bible says the
[12:19] element shall melt with
[12:21] fervent heat means the very in the
[12:24] tribulation
[12:25] what's he doing it will be purged the
[12:26] atmosphere the earth i'm talking very
[12:28] naturally here very very naturally
[12:31] it will be an a maybe an atomic bomb
[12:34] maybe some kind of uh nuke you know
[12:36] brother branham says that the last thing
[12:38] that he's seen
[12:39] was american smoldering ruins and he
[12:41] says
[12:42] that was the last thing just it was
[12:43] smoldering so we know that what is
[12:46] you say well that's god just pouring out
[12:48] his wrath well no no no no
[12:49] he's purifying he's purging the earth
[12:53] for you so that
[12:57] you can live in an earth that matches
[12:59] what's inside of your soul
[13:01] because what's inside of your soul not
[13:03] your flesh is purity
[13:05] righteousness and so the earth will
[13:07] match the condition of the people that
[13:09] live in it that's
[13:10] in essence what he's saying here that
[13:11] are just he says that's coming
[13:13] uh a purification of the tribulation to
[13:15] bring back a restorative word for people
[13:17] who are just in the sight of god to live
[13:18] by his word we've got to go quick
[13:22] now and then at that time see the
[13:24] gentile bride then
[13:26] at that time the gentile bride is in
[13:28] heaven and the sleeping virgin the
[13:30] gentile virgin is not to be
[13:32] saved during that time of tribulation
[13:36] she's already been saved but has been
[13:38] rejected
[13:39] in the bride and she only goes through
[13:42] the tribulation period for the time of
[13:45] purification because she has rejected
[13:48] christ
[13:48] not jesus of nazareth but she's rejected
[13:52] christ
[13:52] the word for her purification can you
[13:55] say amen
[13:57] then she has to suffer for her deeds but
[13:59] the bride who has
[14:00] become the word a complete atonement was
[14:03] made of christ because he is the word
[14:05] that body was rendered and when the body
[14:08] was rendered the bride was
[14:09] in the in that body because it's all the
[14:12] word amen you see it i do i see it
[14:16] the conflict between god and satan
[14:17] brother branham says there's no place
[14:20] where the church ever goes through the
[14:22] tribulation period is referring to the
[14:24] elected
[14:25] christ's blood and the fullness of the
[14:27] application of the blood of jesus christ
[14:29] cleanses all sin and why do we have to
[14:31] be purged
[14:33] we are purged daily
[14:37] no tribulation so we have a choice we'll
[14:39] either go through a tribulation to be
[14:41] purged or we can be purged right now
[14:43] i say lord purge me now listen listen
[14:47] what jesus said in saint john 5 24. now
[14:49] let's just move past that brother
[14:50] branham says here notice
[14:52] in this next quote if standing in line
[14:55] to get into church is going to only be a
[14:57] memory
[14:58] what is going to happen this is a
[15:00] question here what is going to happen
[15:02] if we are not going through the
[15:04] tribulation are we to be
[15:06] seen same some suffering
[15:10] if we're not to see see this question is
[15:13] probably this i'm trying to hurry i
[15:14] ought to do this
[15:15] uh to lay these back because there's a
[15:17] place you could stay on it and then
[15:19] i stay on in an hour just tear it down
[15:21] i'll stop look the people are wanting to
[15:23] say that
[15:24] thinking the church is going to hit the
[15:26] tribulation see
[15:28] it won't it can't
[15:31] because it's already redeemed the church
[15:34] the nominal believers like lot
[15:36] he's going through the tribulation
[15:38] period and be saved as
[15:40] if it was by fire noah went through the
[15:43] tribulation period carried above it
[15:45] come out with ham with who polluted the
[15:47] earth again see lot came
[15:49] his own daughters slept with him and had
[15:51] children by his own daughters see but
[15:53] abraham
[15:54] brought forth the royal seed brought
[15:57] forth the seed of the promise
[15:59] enoch went to glory in the rapture and
[16:01] he's laying these types in here to show
[16:03] you
[16:03] there's a type for a ch for a par for
[16:06] foolish virgin to go through tribulation
[16:08] and bride to be raptured
[16:10] and he says enoch went to glory in the
[16:12] rapture just just took a walk and went
[16:13] home
[16:14] he never went through the tribulation
[16:16] period you see there you are
[16:17] see it does not the bible cannot be the
[16:20] types can
[16:21] can't fail see it does not predict that
[16:23] the bride now the church
[16:25] will go through the tribulation period
[16:27] now the people say what about the early
[16:29] saints that was the changing of the
[16:31] dispensations
[16:32] that was under persecution which if you
[16:34] were here to hear this church ages
[16:36] let's move down to the underlying
[16:37] portion here right just back up right
[16:39] before it
[16:40] he says then come to the time of the
[16:42] calling out of the bride
[16:44] which was to escape all damnation
[16:49] all damnation in the book of luke
[16:52] jesus says that and says he says pray
[16:55] always
[16:57] and he says so that you may be accounted
[17:00] worthy
[17:01] to stand before the son of man
[17:04] and to escape all these things i love
[17:07] that he used that word escape
[17:10] because we're going to escape
[17:14] that means that great trouble is going
[17:16] to be brewing there's going to be great
[17:17] trouble in the land
[17:19] it's not going to be a time of peace
[17:21] it's a great time of trouble
[17:23] but we'll escape we'll be snatched up
[17:26] we'll be called away in the time of
[17:28] trouble psalms 27.
[17:30] he says he says now that uh let me find
[17:32] encounter worthy escape all the
[17:33] damnation and wrath to come upon the
[17:35] earth that you might be kind of worthy
[17:36] to escape it not go through it
[17:38] escape it do you understand now
[17:40] everybody see
[17:41] the church the lukewarm
[17:45] the anything outside of the elected
[17:49] bride
[17:49] will go through the tribulation period
[17:51] they will not they will not
[17:53] raise in the first resurrection the rest
[17:55] of the dead live not for a thousand
[17:56] years
[17:57] just the four ordained elected broad
[18:00] god's own elections
[18:02] who is it brother branham i love this
[18:05] who is it brother burnham he says it's
[18:08] all of this this group here
[18:10] uh he says they were not raised the rest
[18:13] of the dead lived not
[18:14] the four ordained predestinated elected
[18:16] bride god's own choice who is it brother
[18:18] branham i don't know
[18:20] i can't tell you who it is but i know
[18:22] it's going to be there
[18:23] because the lord said they would see
[18:25] they are the ones that will go
[18:27] up from the tribulation but the rest of
[18:29] them will go through the tribulation
[18:35] let's keep going here so let me just say
[18:37] this if brother branham were here today
[18:40] and he was to be asked this same exact
[18:44] question the same exact question
[18:47] will we go through the tribulation will
[18:49] the bride be persecuted will she suffer
[18:52] i will say he would answer it the exact
[18:55] same way
[18:56] he did when he was asked
[19:00] so we don't have time boy i'm really
[19:02] gonna
[19:03] you know say this and then not be able
[19:05] to really clarify but let me just make
[19:07] some statements here
[19:08] even even down to the squeeze that so
[19:12] many people have looked for
[19:13] because of things the prophet of god
[19:16] said but if taken out of context with
[19:18] how he said them now brother matt does
[19:19] that mean you know everything about it
[19:21] no i don't
[19:22] i don't don't know here's there are some
[19:24] things i do know that i can use as
[19:26] anchors the bride doesn't go through the
[19:27] tribulation
[19:29] here's another anchor she doesn't suffer
[19:31] she doesn't have to give her
[19:32] life physically we know that
[19:37] right so we would say that most
[19:41] of so much of what so many people have
[19:43] looked for of this coming squeeze and
[19:45] this pressure that's coming and
[19:47] this ecumenical council that's shutting
[19:50] their church down
[19:51] chasing us down like dogs all of us
[19:52] having to give our
[19:54] all of this mo let me just say this most
[19:56] of everything people have looked for
[19:58] happens in the tribulation period
[20:02] and i don't plan on being here if you
[20:05] don't believe that go listen again i
[20:06] recommend it again the feast of the
[20:07] trumpets there's so much brother branham
[20:09] clarifies with
[20:10] comments he made prior in that message
[20:14] that the bride receives her squeeze she
[20:16] is squeezed
[20:18] in an ecclesia ecclesiastical manner not
[20:20] a physical manner
[20:22] but it's spiritual pressure it's not
[20:24] physical pressure
[20:25] it's spiritual not physical doesn't mean
[20:28] we're not squeezed it's just in a
[20:29] different way
[20:30] and the church will go through that time
[20:33] the tribulation period but
[20:34] not the bride so what is that what is
[20:37] that
[20:37] what is that squeeze that that what what
[20:39] battles us today
[20:40] it's a squeeze to try to uh to try to
[20:43] ban the anointing of god to try to take
[20:46] out the spirit of god out of our
[20:47] churches
[20:48] take away prayer lines take away altar
[20:50] calls take away
[20:51] uh anything like that that that's that's
[20:54] the virus we need to fear
[20:57] brother adam says this in the feast he
[20:59] says what has he done what is it done
[21:01] notice in the cunningness in the
[21:03] cunningness as he said he come in like
[21:05] flatteries
[21:06] what has he done he's bringing the
[21:08] protestant ecumenical council of the
[21:10] world church to the spirit of antichrist
[21:11] upon both of them
[21:13] bringing them to the slaughter just like
[21:14] they just like they did the other
[21:17] in the hour to call the bride how loosed
[21:20] in the
[21:21] ecclesiastical church spirit loosed upon
[21:24] what
[21:25] not upon denominations upon the bride
[21:27] but here you'll get it follow close
[21:30] right here but here you'll get it the
[21:32] bride will not
[21:33] go through that time feast of the
[21:37] trumpets
[21:39] he says the bride will not go through
[21:41] that
[21:42] time the bible says not the church will
[21:45] but not the bride can't you ministers
[21:47] can't you see that brethren
[21:48] you say the church has got to go through
[21:50] the persecution for the perfection of it
[21:52] the blood of jesus christ perfects the
[21:56] bride
[21:58] a man who chooses a wife don't put her
[22:00] through a lot of punishment
[22:02] he's already found grace with her she
[22:05] has found grace with him he engages to
[22:07] her and if there's
[22:09] anything he'll keep her away from every
[22:12] place to turn her hand
[22:13] his grace is so great upon
[22:16] them we ought to be thankful for that
[22:21] his grace is so great upon them
[22:26] and so it will be upon the bride and so
[22:28] it is on the bride we
[22:29] unworthy creatures deserving of hell but
[22:31] his grace holds us
[22:33] through it so we could put a hundred
[22:36] more quotes out here
[22:37] but i think it's so easy for anyone to
[22:40] see if you just have access to the table
[22:42] and if you don't know you can access
[22:44] that online
[22:45] you go to the message hub you go to the
[22:46] table software type in an exact search
[22:49] find exactly what you're looking for
[22:51] if you want to clear some of these
[22:52] things up for yourself so and a lot of
[22:54] people say well you just need revelation
[22:56] you just need to you know order to see
[22:58] this had one brother telling me that
[22:59] we're already in the tribulation brother
[23:01] matt really this is already the trip we
[23:03] already missed the rapture
[23:03] resurrection's already happened dead in
[23:05] christ has already raised we've already
[23:06] missed it all that's what he told me
[23:10] and he said you know you got it you
[23:11] gotta you know you need revelation you
[23:13] need to read
[23:14] between the lines to see the picture
[23:16] what brother adam says
[23:17] i love i personally in study i love
[23:20] reading between the lines
[23:22] you get that from brother branham
[23:24] telling a story about his wife and he
[23:25] was going to go overseas and he says and
[23:27] she wrote a letter and
[23:28] you remember that and he says and i
[23:30] could read between the lines
[23:31] i could read what she was trying to say
[23:33] i love reading between the lines but
[23:35] what i
[23:36] read what we read between the lines must
[23:39] still
[23:39] at least match what's already on the
[23:42] lines
[23:43] must already match it can't can't
[23:45] disagree with what's on it it could
[23:47] further maybe enrich what you're looking
[23:50] at
[23:50] so so uh brother adam says this
[23:54] here let me just keep going here just
[23:56] for a moment
[23:57] that's the reason i do believe that when
[24:00] the bride
[24:00] is called out and elected and said in
[24:03] the book of life
[24:04] there will come a sound from heaven
[24:07] that will take such a baptism of the
[24:09] holy spirit into that bride
[24:12] that will take her from the earth in a
[24:14] rapturing grace
[24:16] god promised it don't care how many
[24:19] science how many astronauts they signed
[24:21] up and everything else how many million
[24:23] miles they can see i don't care nothing
[24:24] about it about that
[24:26] there is a heaven are you glad yes
[24:30] there is a literal jesus christ are you
[24:32] glad
[24:33] that will come in a body form to receive
[24:36] his
[24:37] church to himself no matter how
[24:41] old the story seems it's still
[24:44] the truth god said so that's what
[24:48] believers
[24:49] believe
[24:52] i love that quote here because so many
[24:54] people try to spiritualize the rapture
[24:56] and the coming of the lord and he
[24:57] already came on sunset mountain he's
[24:59] already coming you missed the coming
[25:00] the advent here's here's my thai post
[25:03] this is what believers believe there is
[25:05] a physical return of the lord jesus
[25:07] christ
[25:08] to come and snatch away's bride we're
[25:10] out of time let's stand to our feet
[25:13] thank you jesus for this morning it's
[25:15] lesson lord i pray god that you would
[25:17] settle your word
[25:18] secure it lord plan it and secure it in
[25:21] the hearts of your children
[25:23] lord let it be our stabilization in
[25:26] these uncertain
[25:26] unsettling times let the word be what
[25:29] stabilizes us lord what brings us
[25:31] comfort that's what we're that's what it
[25:34] was sent for you
[25:35] even with the scripture we read in first
[25:36] corinthians 15
[25:38] so shall we be ever with the lord
[25:40] comfort wherefore comfort
[25:42] one another with these words let it be
[25:45] that today god i pray for the service
[25:47] the music the singing the ministry of
[25:49] your word in jesus name
[25:54] amen
