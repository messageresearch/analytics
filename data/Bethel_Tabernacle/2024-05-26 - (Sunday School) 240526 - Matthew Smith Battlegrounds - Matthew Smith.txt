TRANSCRIPT
========================================
e e e e e e e e e e e good morning everybody um let's all uh stand this morning have a word of prayer dear precious father Lord we're very honored to be here this morning Lord grateful to be in good health father and sound mind father that in a place where we could come and gather together in your name in a in a common Church Lord that we could all come together and enjoy the Gathering of the Saints Lord enjoy the move movement of your spirit Lord father we ask you would meet us here Lord that we would open up our hearts open up our minds consecrate ourselves to you turning aside side from anything that would distract us turning our hearts to the things of your kingdom you might edify us and grow us encourage Us in the way that you would take the few words that I have these few notes Lord and that you would move on it and that you would touch the heart of the people that whoever would be listening whatever need that they would have that something might be said to give an encouragement or a spark of a spark of Faith Lord that they could they could withstand this dark Time Lord we ask these things in the precious Name Lord Jesus Christ amen want to ask if you would um turn to Ephesians chapter 6 and we're going to go to verse 12 my thought here I've either through Sunday schools or just ministering here I've I've taken this very similar thought in the past but it's it's been so strong in my heart again I figured i' I'd take it again maybe someone hears something so if you hear something that I've said in the in the past all over again then don't mind maybe you needed to hear it twice but uh maybe someone else needed to hear it for the first time but all right so Ephesians chapter 6 in verse 12 and it says for we wrestled not against flesh and blood but against principalities against Powers against the rulers of the darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places that you know be seated I want to take for a a thought just taking the the the thought of Battlegrounds spiritual Battlegrounds but there was a in January of 1941 the Japanese High command got together and had a a big meeting with the Imperial Japanese Navy and the Army and everything and they have this huge meeting and they the decision was made don't know exactly when but some one day in January of 1941 the decision was made that they were going to go to war with the United States and that their initial attack was going to be at Pearl Harbor in Hawaii and but that was just the opening because the most of what they were interested in was actually all of the US Holdings in the South Pacific um a lot of attention basically gets put on Pearl Harbor but really Pearl Harbor was just the cover for what was actually happening in the Philippines which was that they were going to attack the uh because at the time the Philippines was a US territory as much as Hawaii was a US Territory um a US colony and it as much as Puerto Rico is a US territory now um and the Japanese were planning on taking the Philippines and in order to do so they were going to need to the US Navy in Pearl Harbor and so the decision was made to attack the Navy so they couldn't respond to the attack in the Philippines and all this was going to happen in the space of a day right they the Japanese were planning to do this carry out several different operations across South Pacific and it was all going to happen at the same time and it was going to start with Pearl Harbor and for the next year the Japanese military knew that they were at war with the United States and the United United States did not United States had no idea they might have had some inclination they might have had suspicions but they didn't as far as the American public were concerned as far as the rank and file of the US military nobody had any idea what was coming right they had no idea that they were at War but they were right they were completely oblivious to the fact that there was a military preparing to slaughter them all and completely oblivious right had no idea and this goes on for a year that was in January of 1941 and in December of 1941 almost a year later is when the attack actually came so for a full year the Japanese know there's a war on and the US doesn't and at 610 a.m. off the coast of aaho on the light first light of dawn Japanese planes take off aircraft carriers and they know they're at War and the sailors at Pearl Harbor have no idea they don't know they're at War yet but they are and when a American radar technician sees a flight of aircraft coming towards aahu he says to himself we're not at War these must be American planes returning home sooner than we scheduled and so he disregards the report it's just American planes because he's not thinking he's at War yet and then at 700 a.m. the bombs start falling and a lot of American boys don't go home that day a lot of a lot of mamas got folded flags and a lot of a lot of wives had to explain to little kids that daddy's not coming home because the US didn't realize that they were at War when they enemy knew that they had been for a year they didn't prepare they they were completely unawares they were they they didn't concern themselves with defense because they didn't think that they were they needed to and so often times we in terms of spiritual matters we don't recognize that we are in an actual real deal War it's not it's not metaphorical it's not you know when when it says that we wrestle against principalities and Powers the air it's not it's not a metaphorical battle it's not a it's not just it's not just a an analogy it's a real thing and it has real consequences and it has real casualties and there are people who actually die you know cancer uh uh disease all these things these are ultimately spirits that come on to people and this is all this is all fought in the spiritual realm right you know you have p real PS when you end up with somebody who's got an addiction that they can't kick completely a slave to a substance that's a p right that's a prisoner of of a of a spirit that has has its hold on them and so we can't ever fail to recognize that we have we are surrounded on all sides by by spiritual forces that are actively trying not to ruin your day they're not trying to spoil the whipped cream for your strawberries right they are trying to destroy destroy you they're trying to ruin your life take your life destroy you and destroy your children it's it's not a it's not nothing and because of that because we don't we don't think in terms that this is a a real conflict that has to be taken in the same strictness as an actual or or a physical battle you know we think of military security you don't just go wandering onto a military base best case scenario you go away in handcuffs best case scenario right worst case scenario you go home in a body bag or I guess not home but be kind of horrible to send someone to their home in a body bag but you know there there there military installations where they got big old signs that say Enter you know we shoot on site there ain't no warning shots and they mean it you know you don't you don't you don't just go wandering and because security is important people die if they don't take take these matters very seriously and so how many times people we get lacked in the things that we allow into our lives we get super lack in you know like the the guy on on in Hawaii you know he's he's seeing on the radar he sees the enemy he could have warned people they could have been prepared they could have had been Manning the guns but instead they weren't because he he wasn't he was you know not thinking that it was a big deal you know and so in so many times we we don't recognize that the conflict is so serious that we allow media into the house that shouldn't be there we participate in in conversations we have associations and friendships that we really shouldn't have because at the end of the day the guy that you're fighting the your main combatant is the guy in the mirror right we we want to put it all off on onto you know the devil or or whatever but at the end of the day the greatest battle that ever that has ever been fought happens between your ears right at the end of the day you're you know you're you know I've read this quote so many times and I I always keep coming back to it it says as questions and answerers 1950 1959 it says Canaan is not a typee of the Millennium because they had Wars fightings killings and everything else in Canaan Canaan is a type of the Holy Ghost Egypt is the world that they come out of the Wilderness is where they were Sanctified called out Church Canaan is where they settled down with the holy spirit because they still had Wars and if you don't believe you have wars just get the Holy Spirit want okay and what happens is so many times people you know you're born in sin shaped iniquity and you have an unregenerated nature and when your flesh desires to do something evil your spirit agrees because they are totally in line with each other right and there's nothing to say no there's no struggle there there's no battle there there's no battle against your nature to do something that you know is wrong because it's all chasing evil but when you get the Holy Spirit suddenly there's conflict because when your flesh wants to do one thing there's a holy spirit that says you will not right and so now there's a there's a there's a struggle and the guy that we're so our struggle is against the flesh that is constantly trying to do evil right and he's influenced by this environment that he's in though at the end of the day at the end of the day your flesh man is basically just a chimpanzee with an IQ score right he's got all the proclivities of of of an animal he's got all the proclivities of just no no real spiritual awareness and so many times people have you know people think that they have they make decisions and they they think that they're you know people think they're a lot smarter than they actually are people think they're making decisions logically and and with all kinds of you know pre-thought but reality most times decisions are made emotionally and and your logic is after the fact you come up with a reason for what you're doing after you've already decided to do it right that's just people operate and unfortunately all that emot you know that that spiritual realm that conscience and reason and memories and affections these are all so easily influenced because it's all part of your physical person right it's all part of your physical person you know the the are triggers and there psychological things that happen in your brain that are going to cause you to feel certain kinds of ways whether you want to or not no matter how smart you are no matter how logical you can try to reason yourself out of it it doesn't change certain realities for instance no matter how smart you think you are you get around a certain kind of person you will become that certain kind of person right you are the sum of your five closest Associates the people you see every day are who your flesh will become that's just all there is to it and no matter how smart you are no matter how hard you try to just make that not a reality it'll seep in eventually right your associations will change who you are and if you think that it doesn't get around somebody that you don't like for a while but you got to work with especially like a cooworker that you have a hard time with and it's only a matter of time but you'll start noticing you do stuff like they do and you you can't stand it right it it'll drive you nuts but because that's that's that's the flesh right and the battle that you're fighting against that flesh is to come totally under subjection of the word right and um I so appreciated brother Don's uh sermon on Wednesday I had actually had put this together before he preached that and it so struck me because you know where he was going down that line of how people will think that there's thoughts that are arising that are them but it's it's not really them right so many times you think that you have a thought arising in your mind that's contrary to the word but that's not you you have to recognize there's a real you on the inside that's not the chimpanzee with an IQ score right that's it's not who you are that's somebody that you got tied to right that's something that you are stuck with until the until the body change right and so when the word of God says there you're going to be made more than a conqueror then you have to accept the fact that that is that is true right it says we are made more than conquerors right now whether your memory agrees with that or not right you you know there's a this is from uh greatest battle ever fought says if you'll come and you'll keep them memories and conscience and everything thinking about well I might fail it might not be right don't you do that at all you throw aside everything and open up the channel and say God your word is eternally true and it's for me if the whole church fails if the whole world fails yet I can't fail because I'm taking your word there's the battle okay that's the battle line right there that when the Bible says that you can overcome anything that besets you you say that's true and I I am an overcomer regardless of whether or not you just fell on your face right that when when you make an absolute hash out of things you stand back up and you repent and say Lord I'm sorry and I'm taking your word to carry on that I've overcome this right that no matter what no matter what report you get whether it is it is um no matter how bad things might seem no matter how bad you might fail in your flesh right you say but that's not me that's not who I am I'm taking the word of God that says I'm redeemed and above that and then you press forward no matter what what the devil throws at you no matter no matter um uh just just no matter Come What May and but on the other hand we also have to we have to be honest with ourselves in what we allow into our lives and allow to influence our spiritual environment right so many times it's this is just a sort of a military truism that the weather pretty much determines the battle right it doesn't matter how big and powerful your tanks are if the weather is so bad that the ground has turned into mush your tanks will get bogged down and will be very easily destroyed they will be annihilated if you try to operate in bad weather and in some cases bad weather is great because it means you can move around with you know without is as with without certain um uh like uh spy planes and things and so likewise we have a spiritual environment we have a the weather the spiritual weather around you is absolutely determined by the media and the the people and the atmosphere around you right you know how you know it talk you know the Bible says faith comeing by hearing the word well if you're constantly you know allowing things into your home that are not the word right you're constantly allowing the product of Satan's e to be in your home right you constantly have media that's contrary to the word of God playing in your home what's that doing to the spiritual environment of your home right what's that doing to the spiritual environment how are you supposed to have strength to combat the devil when everything all the all the the the you know entertainment that you're consuming is directly contrary to the thing that's supposed to give you strength right how are you supposed to you know have faith when the people you choose to hang out with bring you doubt right how are you supposed to be pressing for Holiness when you're constantly feeding on unholiness right this is and it's simple and it's not it's I I know this is kind of like I guess it's Sunday school right um it's simple but you know I I heard a an interview with an engineer he was a actually one of the guys who worked on a lot of the social media platforms that I'm sure we all know of um and he's very much against social media because he's basically like listen if you don't think that these are systems engineered to control your mind then I have a let me I have news for you he's like I built them I know exactly what we did like he he has a he's a um psychology background he was brought in specifically to engineer these social media platforms to be become addictive and and to manipulate people psychologically and he goes you know the funny thing about it is you know I built the platform I know exactly how it works I you know you know me and my team engineered a lot of the things that you take for granted in social media we came up with the idea because we knew that it would get people hooked that you know it's con it's that constant feedback loop of wanting you know you know that the way the algorithm will feed you content and things like that and he said the way that you know that it works is because it works on you even when you know it's happening yes you can be 100% aware that it's happening and it'll still work on you you can know that it's manipulating you and you're you just got to click on the next video you just got to scroll a little longer right because you because your brain is just feeding on that that little bit of you know those those psychological buttons and so you know we know that we can be manipulated we know that this is the environment that we're in we know that that the media that we have you know whether it's social media or or any kind of media really it's engineered to to pull you in to to drag you in even if it's not necessarily you know something UNH wholesome or or or vile it's still something that's distracting you you know it's still something that's eating your time it's still something that you know oh well you know you know we know it I know it's very simple I know it's very simplistic I know it's almost like well you know this is almost a message for little kids and yet we're adults and still addicted to our phones and you know it's it it doesn't matter who you are you can know that it's working on you and it's still working on you right and so you know I just I guess you know I would just be if I have a a takeaway from this it's that you know in this in this day and age in this time where we are we are pressing towards you know the the straight and narrow way is getting so narrow that there's there's no there's no turning to the left hand or the right there's no margin for error there's no room for for for for slack right everything has to be has has to be so precise because you know you know Bible says that in the last day that you know it would be so close as to deceive the very elect if it were possible you know we're coming to a point where you know there's there's not going to be a a clear line of separation of who's making it and who's not and it's I can I can one thing I know for sure it's going to be the people who are of avoiding feeding on the on the product of Satan's Eden and then feeding instead on the things of God that's one thing I know for sure is that the more you turn off YouTube and instead turn on the prophet of the age the better right you're you're and everything everything in this world is engineered to siphon away as much time as it can right to just distract you to keep your eyes glued to it and to and to carnal eyesee the atmosphere that you're in right to keep your eyes on things of the world because as long as you're looking on things of the world there's no it's it's it's muddying your faith it's or it's mud muddying your spiritual senses to the to the to the things going on around you and you know I I know it's it's as I said it seems simplistic it seems um maybe simple but at the but you know so often times it's the simple things that it's the little foxes you know that spoil the vine it's the simple things that we don't we don't pay attention to that will just absolutely destroy us and so I just you know as a as an encouragement maybe that that we would we would lay aside a lot of this to just press press into into press against that that nature press against the flesh that doesn't want to feed on the word press against that that flesh that doesn't that so desperately wants to turn away to to carnal things to to to worldly things and instead just keep your mind ever ever focused on things of the of the word things of of a of a um of a spiritual of a Godly spiritual um uh nature because you know the that atmosphere that you build build for yourself you know you you create an atmosphere around yourself and that atmosphere is absolutely going to influence um you know who who we are it's you know we think you know just I I'll just finish off with this just as a closing thought you know we we think about um how you know we know that music just some something as simple as music will bring Spirits into the room right you we know that the you know in the Bible the prophets you know called for music in order to prophesy we know that David played um music for Saul to drive away evil spirit we know that the wrong kind of music can bring an evil spirit into the room right and you know it's like and I know it's it's almost seems like overly I don't know I don't want to come off as legalistic but you know it's something as simple as this you know you're you know okay I'm going to watch the baseball game and there's look watching a baseball baseball is not lwd it's not it's nothing the game itself isn't all that bad but the ad reel that plays every minute and a half you know is some you know Ford Mustang ad with you know rock and roll guitar riff playing on it and it's like well okay that ad played for 30 seconds and for 30 seconds you just called demon Spirits into your house right and okay it was 30 seconds but how many demon Spirits went into your home in that 30 seconds right okay it wasn't a million it was it was only 100 right it was only 50 it was only 25 cancer Spirits right it was only it was only 25 depression Spirits you know came into your home in that 30 seconds and it's like well yeah you know maybe maybe if maybe if we're serious about this there shouldn't be any evil spirits coming into your house right maybe that number should be zero how are we supposed you know and I you know it's just it's just been on my heart you know that we should we shouldn't be we shouldn't be loose on these things we should be tighter on these things we should be we should be very careful with with how [Music] we you know like the Le in the in you know we talk about the token applying the token to the home yeah you could put you could put the blood over the doorpost circumcised man they did did everything right but if there was still leev in the home the blood over your door post meant nothing there was leaven in your home you know be very careful about what's in your home you you know when the when the death angel comes to knocking on your door you know you don't have a whole lot of ground to stand on to say there's blood over my door I've applied the token no the the blood over the doorpost wasn't was just simply an external indication that the leaven was out of the home so if there's no if there's Levan in your home if there's sin in your home if there's little carnal things poisoning the atmosphere of your home you're not going to have a whole lot of token Authority when the Devil comes knocking so we'll we'll end with that went over time a little bit let's stand and have a word of prayer father Lord I just trust that maybe something that I said would encourage somebody give somebody the little bit of encouragement Lord to press forward to rise a little bit higher to maybe avoid something that would displease you Lord that they would be stronger in the faith and father that grow their faith that they would be able to hold to the word that there would be no eliminating and laying aside all these voices that would naysay the word of God and to bring a a bad atmosphere around us father we ask that maybe something I would have said would bring an encouragement that it wouldn't be just simply my words Lord but maybe that it would spoke to somebody's heart and spoke to a need that they would have they could take it and go forward and meet the devil father on these this dark time we ask these things in Jesus name amen
