========================================

heavenly father we just come to you now lord and we're so thankful for your mercy and grace to us lord we're so thankful for how you've given us your spirit lord you've changed our lives and you're moving in a mighty way in our hearts lord and we're so thankful we pray that you'd continue this move amongst your people lord draw us near to you move in hearts lord bring healing deliverance spiritual strength to your people lord we need you to come to confirm your word in the hearts of the people lord that it would that we would become those living written epistles read and known of all men we ask these things in jesus christ's name amen for this sunday school i'm going to be speaking on the priesthood of all believers and first scripture i want to look at is exodus 28 and verse 1. and take thou unto thee aaron thy brother and his sons with him from among the children of israel that he may minister unto me in the priest's office even arab nadab aaron nadab and abihu eleazar and ithamer aaron's sons amen can be seated so just to give a little bit background to this priesthood of all believers and we'll talk about it more in detail as we go along but in in the the history of the church the ministry office began to be spoken about as a priest right and so time went on this took on so many different forms that basically he was a mediator between god and the laity and so this is like the nic the fruition of the nicolaitan spirit to conquer the laity and so the priest now is the only one that can interpret the bible you can't even you a laity person can't even read the bible because it would bring him so much destruction in his life that's the belief system that they had and so then through the sacraments of the church the grace of god through the priest is given to the people and so that's the thing that it took took on and luther uh in his work that he wrote to the um the the german people he he said that every believer is a priest and it was a radical departure from the understanding of the medieval church in the dark ages but it was scripture amen and so we want to talk about that and and look at that so looking at the priesthood the word the word there in exodus 28 is kahan usually it's cohen so this is like the act of being a priest so priests office office it means to mediate in religious offerings so right within the concept of a priest it's speaking of a mediator so under the old covenant there were three divisions of priests there was the high priests there was the priests and then there was the levites the high priest and the priests all came from the family of aaron and aaron only so the people that offered sacrifices that did offer the incense all those activities was all done by aaron's family and descendants one person was chosen from the from that family to be the high priest then the rest they had their different orders and and and hierarchy developed and all these things developed over time that you that you see that that we arrive at in the new testament where jesus is confronting them and you have the the chief priests so it's like a family of chief priests and sort of a rotation all of these things these then there's multiple hierarchies that they made they're not scriptural they're developed after the fact just like we have hierarchies developed in the church they did it with the levitical priesthood so the function of priests of the high priest priest levites priests and a high priest had a specific duties he was also the leader of the priests and then the priests had many many different duties and then there was the levites the levites could be from any levitical family and they were in charge of sacred things uh they were they were the ones when the ark of the covenant was to be moved they weren't were never to touch it but they would put poles through it and carry it so that was their duty when they wrapped up the tabernacle now it changed and it when there was a temple built and it's in one structure but still they the same responsibilities basically continued on the function of priests was not just to offer sacrifices but it was also to teach and to judge in scriptural matters in people's lives as i said time went on they developed hierarchies and they developed parties sects denominations of priests etc let's look at hebrews 5 verse 1. for every high priest is taken from among men is ordained for men in things pertaining to god that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins okay so the priest is taken from among men of course we understand in the old testament it was aaron's family and but they're taken from among men and they're ordained for men in other words they're there for the purpose of serving men and in things pertaining to god in other words it's a minister it's a servant it's a place to be a mediator between god and men hebrews 3 verse 1. in the old testament they had many high priests succession of high priest they had a family of high priests it was like a almost like a a genetic monarchy where it went from one to one to one they had some changes in there due to the sins of eli and his family but basically it was it was a passed on from from father to son hebrews 3 1 wherefore holy brethren partakers of the heavenly calling consider the apostle and high priest of our profession christ jesus now under the new covenant who's the high priest it's jesus christ first timothy 2 verse 5 says there's one god and one mediator between god and men the man christ jesus there's only one mediator there's only one high priest and he didn't offer a sacrifice distinct from himself and continually do it as we find in hebrews he offered himself once for all he's not continuing why because it was a perfect sacrifice that accomplished something that was perfect amen that was complete nothing needed to be added to it so he as that high priest still stands as a mediator between us and god amen first peter 2 verse 9. but ye are a chosen generation a royal priesthood a holy nation a peculiar people that you should show forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvelous light now who is a chosen generation who is a royal priesthood is it only the five-fold ministry no every believer now is anointed by the holy ghost to be a priest is it just men just the brothers or priests does it give some distinctions no it's every single believer is now a priest but we truly only have one high priest and we truly only have one mediator but i want you to look at it differently because under the old testament did those priests have the baptism of the holy ghost no what is what do we have in the new testament christ in you the hope of glory why are we priests because the high priest is living inside of us so then what what are we what do we do um let's let's look at ii corinthians 5. 18 and all things are of god who hath reconciled us to himself by jesus christ and hath given to us the ministry of reconciliation to wit that god was in christ reconciling the world unto himself not imputing their trespasses unto them and hath committed unto us the word of reconciliation now then we are ambassadors for christ as though god did beseech you by us we pray you in christ that be reconciled to god i want to ask a question do you believe that these verses are merely limited to the five-fold ministry i wouldn't deny that the five-fold ministry has a special calling within that but these verses are not limited to that because right before we read this it says we are a new creation if any man be in christ he's a new creation old things passed away behold all things are become new and he's then the next person says and he's given to us the ministry of reconciliation and but but who is doing it who is performing it is it is it god in heaven and then uh between god you have the mother of god and then you have christ and then angels and then another group of angels and then you got the pope and archbishops and cardinals and and bishops and priests that's the that's the that's the old viewpoint but here's we have a problem and and you say well we don't have a problem with that we're message believers we listen in every day to brother branham condemning that but we maybe we do have a problem a little bit of a problem we see nicolet and preachers raise up and they misuse the understanding of the fivefold ministry and they start taking that and putting it upon this priesthood oh we have a priesthood again the fivefold ministry and if you don't and the pastor is the supreme authority true true but that doesn't make him now the priest mediating between you and god but that's the viewpoint that preachers and nicolaitan preachers in this message have put forth you've got to listen to your pastor to be saved your pastor is a tool in god's hands to build your faith but it's not your pastor that's leading you to salvation the holy spirit does that work me your pastor we are simply a voice to remind you of what's in here and to help you better understand what's in here but you have to be like the bereans you're like the bereans you're not like they were in the old testament in the old testament they are waiting for a sacrifice to happen we're waiting for this man to do his duty before god and then we can receive god's blessings no no you can go in your closet in your bedroom you can lay on your bed and approach god and he can talk to you and he can reveal this message to you does he use preachers i sure hope he does i sure hope he does and i know he does that's scriptural i believe he does but remember this is not what i'm saying is not my words doesn't accomplish your salvation christ has already accomplished your salvation and you believe that you don't need me to get to christ and and that that that is an issue and that is a misunderstanding even sincere people very sincere people but they they misunderstand and say my pastor is going to lead me into the rapture is there a quote that says something like that well not really but people have quoted it as though it says that but it don't say that it says when you have difficult situations in your church and people are fussing and fighting with each other brother brahms referring to brother neville and he says stay with your pastor he's ordained to lead you through well brother neville was a good godly man that brother branham knew by experience could lead them through what if the preacher was not a good godly man and he was an ornery guy and all he did was damage people should we stay bar by our pastor so that he would lead us through through what he's the problem and so this is the this is the issue is that a real preacher understands his role simply as to be a tool to communicate god's word with you but he doesn't bring you salvation the word that he preaches can accomplish salvation but god is dealing directly with you as an individual he's not dealing with you through me in order to get to god you got to come through the preacher that's not scriptural amen that's not correct god uses the preacher god sends the preacher as a gift but his words are to communicate god's words directly to you and it isn't even him he needs to understand that and you need to understand that it isn't even him he is supposed to merely be a vessel and a tool for god to get to you because god is working in you directly and this you know the these things it takes balance by the holy spirit and when we there's a thousand different directions you can go the wrong way there's one right way and it's it's very important you can't take this and say we don't need preachers i'm staying home i don't i don't need anything i just read the bible that's not scriptural but people will take this idea that's a direction that a ditch that people go into the other ditch that people go into is we need the five-fold ministry and the five-fold ministry now becomes a mediator between god and men and that's not it that's not it you are a mediator between god and men if you really want to look at it every believer is every single believer is why because he's committed to us the word the ministry of reconciliation to each of us anyone that's a new creation in christ has the word of reconciliation committed to them so that now you are a go-between between god and man no you didn't offer the sacrifice you're not a high priest you're you're you're one you're one of the priests you're you're a priest you're part of the order of melchizedek if you want to put it that way we're all a royal priesthood so i just wanna i'm gonna kind of back up to what i was talking about before and not that we can completely need this but i think some of the history is helpful just to see balance these things out this is reading from the gospel coalition website talking about the priesthood of all believers the medieval church taught that god works exclusively through a select class of priests as they administered the seven sacraments of the church protestants on the other hand believe that all people in the church are priests or in the language of the 16th century reformer martin luther the priesthood of all believers what are the difference differences between these two views in short the medieval view rests on the teaching of church tradition whereas the protestant view grows out of scripture medieval christians believe that the church was a part of a celestial hierarchy where everything in the heavens and earth had its place in a great chain of being the great chain begins with god then archangels angels heavenly hierarchy finds its earthly parallel through the sacraments those who are inspired by god to comprehend them and those initiated by them god passes his knowledge and grace down the chain to the angels you see how it's a it's a means to control right it's a means to control that's all it is who in turn invests this information in the sacraments and those who administer the sacraments the priests who then give them to the laity salvation chiefly comes through the sacraments and the priests who administer them and the priests are a unique class of individual have been gifted by god to contemplate the things of god they are of a higher order than ordinary people who have no capacity for such sublime truth this view of hierarchy prevailed in the church through the middle ages until the 16th century protestant reform reformation luther challenged this prevailing notion because he rejected the church's claims he believed the church rested its idea of the unique priestly class on tradition rather than the authority of scripture luther instead believed that offering the sacrifice of the mass did not make one a priest but rather anyone who had faith in christ our great high priest was indeed a priest of god in lit luther's typical pithy manner he claimed faith alone as the true priestly office luther's idea of the priesthood of all believers versus the priesthood of only a select few rests in the priestly office of christ and in the believer's blessing to share in all that christ is through union with him that is where we secure our blessing through christ it's not through me it's not through your pastor with any all of us are merely tools in god's hand not just the preacher all of us my wife is a tool in the hand of god to help me right even my children are a tool in the hand of god these things the god i think the thing is i want you to understand god is working in you god is working the teenager that's filled with the holy ghost it doesn't it doesn't have to be well now you have some great qualification god will use you if you have the holy ghost god can use you ephesians see ephesians chapter 4. verse 11 and 12 and he gave some apostles and some prophets and some evangelists and some pastors and teachers i want you to watch this for the perfecting of the saints perfecting is not the same word that is translated in other places as as perfect or which means complete here it's it it it contains part of that but the whole word is complete furnishing in other words equipping so the five-fold ministry is to be there to equip completely furnished in other words you have a war to fight and the five-fold ministry is to give you the materials you need to fight in that war so for the perfecting of the saints for what purpose for the work of the ministry so you are called to a ministry the five-fold ministry is to equip the ministry of the church the ministry of you each one of you so that that is the correct understanding and balance of what the purpose of the ministry is and what the purpose of you is revelations 5. verse eight nine and ten and when he had taken the book the four beasts and four and twenty elders fell down before the lamb having every one of them harps and golden vials full of older odors which are the prayers of the saints and they sung a new song saying thou art worthy to take the book and to open the seals there thereof for thou a slain has redeemed us to god by thy blood out of every kindred in tongue and people and nation and has made us unto god our god kings and priests and we shall reign on the earth every believer has been already been made kings and priests this isn't a future event he already paid the price and put us in the position of being king kings and priests where it says royal priesthood it's basically the same exact concept communicated differently royal means kingly in that word you are a kingly priesthood so we we are under christ under christ we are part of a royal family and that royal family every member in that royal family is what a priest every member is a minister of god to the world go into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature was never meant only for preachers not and not for the laity it was meant for every one of us to be witnesses of what jesus christ has done in our lives let's stand heavenly father we thank you so much for your word we thank you so much for this truth lord that each one of us is ordained to be a priest lord we're put in a position of divine authority to be used as a tool in your hand to accomplish salvation healing and deliverance for those who are out there in the world that need to be called unto you lord let us set aside our own way of thinking our own approach to things lord and may we continue walking in this faith that you've called us to to be a priest lord strengthen us to see what authority and what position you've put us in we ask your blessing father in the name of jesus christ amen amen god bless you you
