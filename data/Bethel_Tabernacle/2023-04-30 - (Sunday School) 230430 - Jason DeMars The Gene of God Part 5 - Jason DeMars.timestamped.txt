[5:27] everyone
[5:28] God bless you
[5:30] we're going to continue on the topic the
[5:32] gene of God part five
[5:34] and normally I'd have you stand but
[5:36] we're going to do it a little
[5:37] differently we'll uh we'll pray you can
[5:40] keep at your seats and we'll start going
[5:43] through a few different things here so
[5:44] Heavenly Father we come before you Lord
[5:46] and we ask that your Holy Spirit would
[5:48] come and take your word and make it
[5:50] alive in our hearts Lord thank you so
[5:52] much for
[5:53] supplying us Lord with such a rich and
[5:55] beautiful revelation of yourself in this
[5:58] day Lord through that prophet
[6:00] Lord who just got himself out of the way
[6:02] Lord May uh May each of us do the same
[6:06] get ourselves out of the way that your
[6:07] Revelation could flow through US Lord
[6:09] that we would be a light to this fallen
[6:13] and evil World father go before us Lord
[6:15] we just bind every Spirit of the enemy
[6:19] in the name of Jesus Christ and we ask
[6:22] that
[6:23] healing and and strengthening and
[6:26] understanding would flow to your people
[6:28] we ask in Jesus name amen
[6:33] so the gene of God
[6:36] we're talking about
[6:38] you know the the background of this word
[6:41] the word Genesis is the Greek
[6:43] translation for the word beginning in
[6:45] the beginning
[6:46] then we fast forward to the Greek New
[6:49] Testament and we have this word only
[6:51] begotten son so that word only begotten
[6:55] is manojanao
[6:59] uniquely begotten our term Gene so you
[7:03] see that word there in general Gene
[7:05] obviously
[7:06] so our term Gene has that same origin as
[7:10] the term only begotten
[7:11] Gene by definition is a unit of heredity
[7:15] which is transferred from a parent to
[7:17] offspring and is held to to determine
[7:20] some characteristic of The Offspring
[7:25] so Gene speaks of origin in connection
[7:27] with his characteristics
[7:29] same idea behind the word attribute that
[7:32] you hear Brother Branham used so
[7:34] frequently the word characteristic
[7:37] our nature and characteristics come from
[7:40] our origin and a point that I want to
[7:43] make is science looks at this as
[7:46] flesh only
[7:48] this is all that they look at it you're
[7:50] you're functioning of your brain the
[7:52] functioning of our bodies but there's a
[7:54] lot of
[7:55] there's a lot that they miss because of
[7:57] that because we're we're a tripartite
[8:01] being we're made we're made of a
[8:03] spiritual aspect we're made up of a
[8:06] fleshly aspect and then behind on the
[8:09] inside of the inside of that there is a
[8:11] soul
[8:12] and so I think it's clear as we'll study
[8:15] this is that
[8:17] all three of those are impacted by
[8:20] genetics
[8:23] let me just let me just
[8:25] take a minute and talk about that
[8:29] before we prove our point we'll just
[8:31] talk about it for a second you see the
[8:33] the the the thought behind it
[8:36] so our spirit
[8:38] right that's our that's our that's where
[8:41] our mind resides
[8:42] right you have a brain that connects
[8:45] this body this is like a computer that
[8:48] connects this body to the thing that
[8:51] actually runs it which is the spiritual
[8:53] aspect behind it when that spiritual
[8:55] aspect is severed from this body
[8:58] the body as a computer as as a machine
[9:01] and credible machine that God made
[9:04] Beyond any computer that's ever designed
[9:07] it
[9:08] it's done it's finished We Lay It
[9:11] We Lay it in the ground
[9:13] right
[9:14] and God will pick it up again in the
[9:16] resurrection
[9:18] but if we if if we separate that we
[9:22] don't cease to have our memories you
[9:23] know we can go through scripture on this
[9:26] but it's very clear that all all the
[9:29] people in that are in heaven have the
[9:31] memories of what they were on Earth
[9:32] we've we read it before about that um
[9:35] Lazarus and the rich man the rich man
[9:38] knew his family had feelings for his
[9:40] family
[9:42] um on Earth desired they're even in Hell
[9:45] desired their salvation that they
[9:48] wouldn't come to that place and you know
[9:50] in a way they were praying
[9:53] they were they were making a prayer
[9:54] please send them you know making it
[9:57] through Abraham but please send them
[9:59] back if you send them back they'll
[10:01] believe so they're and then in
[10:03] Revelation chapter five
[10:05] uh no chapter six but the fifth seal the
[10:09] souls under the altar how long Lord till
[10:12] you avenge our blood
[10:15] and he says a little while a little
[10:18] while until your brethren are killed
[10:20] like you
[10:21] so they they know their connection they
[10:24] know their connection to other people so
[10:26] when our my when our spirit separates
[10:28] from our body we don't cease to think
[10:31] we don't cease to operate the brain is a
[10:34] connection between that spirit and your
[10:37] body to control the body memory
[10:40] conscience reason affection and I always
[10:43] miss one of them
[10:46] um
[10:47] and I'm so what's that
[10:49] imagination
[10:51] thank you you know each of those
[10:53] continue to exist
[10:55] after the spirit leaves this body that's
[10:57] a spirit then the Soul that's the nature
[11:00] of the spirit
[11:02] and in Us in everybody there's a hybrid
[11:04] nature all of this all three of these
[11:08] things we can find and we the
[11:10] characteristics of those
[11:12] of who you are is connected to your
[11:17] parentage
[11:18] all of that comes from back back back
[11:21] you're the sum total of the genetics of
[11:26] your mother's side and father's side and
[11:29] all their ancestors all the way back to
[11:31] the very beginning
[11:33] and so that that isn't it isn't as
[11:36] though God makes your body
[11:38] and then your spirit and soul come into
[11:41] it and it's something totally separate
[11:43] and different you can always find that
[11:45] those
[11:46] those spiritual you can trace it back to
[11:49] characteristics even Paul says you you
[11:52] know you receive this from your
[11:54] grandmother
[11:55] Lois well you say it was just she just
[11:57] read the Bible to him no he he's saying
[11:59] there's a genetic thing that's passed on
[12:01] and we all can find that within our if
[12:04] we search back and look back you can see
[12:06] how there's a stream of spiritual people
[12:09] following the word for your age
[12:11] somewhere in your family
[12:14] even if and even if not it still can pop
[12:17] out of nowhere two total unbelieving
[12:19] Heathen parents
[12:21] can produce a son or daughter of God say
[12:25] how is it possible well let's keep
[12:27] studying
[12:29] First John 3 8-10 we read it I think
[12:32] four times through the last
[12:35] um
[12:36] uh sermon and and Sunday school that
[12:39] showed us that there are those born of
[12:41] God who have the seed of God in them the
[12:44] Sheep they're a children of God by
[12:46] election they have a place in their
[12:49] hearts for the word
[12:51] and then there are those who are the
[12:53] children of the devil they're not sheep
[12:55] and we found out that the word has no
[12:57] place in them
[12:59] they're both born in the same condition
[13:00] dead in sin walking after the prince of
[13:03] the power of the air but some have a
[13:06] place for the word to receive the word
[13:08] and some have no place for that word
[13:10] First John 3 10 says they're manifest by
[13:13] whether they do righteousness and love
[13:14] their brother the seed of God hear the
[13:16] voice of the shepherd
[13:19] and their life begins to manifest the
[13:23] life of their parent God the children of
[13:27] the devil they hate his voice they want
[13:29] to silence it and they work against it
[13:31] though they be ever so religious
[13:34] they're religious because they have that
[13:36] inside of them from from Eve the
[13:39] genetics from Eve
[13:40] the seed of God can receive the true
[13:43] baptism of the Holy Ghost every seed can
[13:45] receive an anointing
[13:47] every seed can receive an anointing it
[13:49] doesn't matter if you're the seed of God
[13:52] or the seed of the serpent you can
[13:54] receive an anointing but the true seed
[13:59] of God is the one that can receive the
[14:02] baptism of the Holy Ghost and their
[14:03] souls
[14:04] galatian calls it adoption or other
[14:07] words the placing of sons because you
[14:09] are Sons he sent forth the spirit of his
[14:12] son into your heart whereby you cry
[14:14] father father Abba Father
[14:17] you can do that because you are Sons not
[14:19] because you became Sons but because you
[14:21] are Sons by predestination
[14:25] in the sermon communion let's look at a
[14:27] few places that brother Branham clearly
[14:29] shows that this Gene seed of God is
[14:32] there you're born with it from your
[14:35] mother
[14:36] it's not something that enters into you
[14:38] later on but it's inside of you by by
[14:42] election
[14:44] I was taking I was saying this taking
[14:46] for myself like he was going to say
[14:48] William Branham well 40 years ago with
[14:51] the William Branham it isn't the same
[14:53] one tonight if somebody back there would
[14:55] say William Branham he was a ranked
[14:56] Rascal see because I was born of Charles
[14:59] and ellebranum in their nature I was a
[15:01] sinner I came to the world a liar in all
[15:03] the habits of the world laid right in me
[15:05] but down in there too was another nature
[15:08] present C predestinated was in there by
[15:11] God in this same body see two Natures in
[15:14] there
[15:15] see he was it was in there it was inside
[15:18] of him even though he was born of
[15:20] Charles and Ella Branham
[15:22] somehow through Charles and ellebranum
[15:25] he received this Gene that was inside of
[15:27] him
[15:28] that was a different nature that was
[15:30] crying out for something different
[15:33] he says well I catered to one as I
[15:34] growed I grew it as a baby Dada first
[15:36] thing you know I become a liar become
[15:38] everything else that's a sinner because
[15:40] I raised up that way but down in there
[15:42] was a little speck of Life all the time
[15:46] what was it there was another William
[15:48] Branham see a little spot of eternal
[15:51] life down there from the genes of God
[15:54] the word of God that was placed in there
[15:57] each one of you can think of similar
[15:59] things see it was working there's a
[16:01] place
[16:02] in the predestinated seeds heart to
[16:06] receive the word what is it it's the
[16:08] genes of God
[16:10] inside you
[16:12] in the sermon Paradox now the genes
[16:16] I want to expand this a little bit as we
[16:18] were talking before now the genes in the
[16:20] father and the mother of this boy no
[16:22] matter how much they are converted Still
[16:25] Remains the flesh that's been interbred
[16:27] out of this boy therefore the boy has
[16:29] got a complex in him just like from his
[16:32] mother's family and they're not
[16:34] forgiving they'll not apologize that's
[16:36] where that voice stands
[16:39] so you see this is this is a a state of
[16:44] mind it's not merely an attribute of
[16:46] Flesh his his uh hair is red his
[16:51] his skin is uh really light or his skin
[16:54] is middle or skin is dark that comes
[16:56] from it's not a merely fleshly genetics
[17:00] that's been talking about there there is
[17:02] an attribute and a nature
[17:04] a characteristic from the parents that
[17:08] comes down and you see I'll visit the
[17:10] iniquity of the fathers upon the
[17:11] children it's very plain and simple that
[17:14] it's passed on period
[17:17] you you have that in you now it could be
[17:19] excessive or it could could be or could
[17:22] be dominant or it could be recessive
[17:24] you never know but it's in there it
[17:25] might miss you and go to the Next
[17:26] Generation you see but it's there it's
[17:29] there and it keeps going on
[17:32] and it will keep going on and brother
[17:33] Branham says in this no matter uh no
[17:37] matter how much they're converted see
[17:39] parents converted their lives changed
[17:42] but yet there was something in their
[17:44] genetics that caused them to be
[17:46] unforgiving when the boy was born he
[17:48] wasn't born born again
[17:50] he was born with those same nature and
[17:52] attributes that his parents have and he
[17:55] needs to be born again to overcome that
[17:57] otherwise he'll continue in the same
[17:59] nature that his parents were born with
[18:01] that clear That's genetics that's that's
[18:04] how it works that's
[18:06] biblically scientific if we put it that
[18:09] way
[18:11] Hebrews 7 scripture Bears this out as
[18:13] well we'll read verse 5 and then we'll
[18:15] read nine and ten
[18:17] and verily they that are of the sons of
[18:19] Levi who receive the office of the
[18:21] priesthood have a commandment to take
[18:23] tithes
[18:25] of the people according to the law that
[18:27] is of their Brethren though they come
[18:28] out of the loins of Abraham
[18:30] and as I may say so say Levi also who
[18:34] receive tithes paid tithes in Abraham
[18:37] for he was yet in the loins of his
[18:39] father when Melchizedek met him so you
[18:43] see you're in the genes the genetics of
[18:46] your father your past down you you go
[18:50] forward and even the positive side of
[18:53] this was Abraham paid ties the
[18:54] Melchizedek God allotted it to Levi
[18:57] praise the Lord if if the Lord tarries
[19:00] and we have grandchildren
[19:02] um hopefully you're going to have
[19:03] grandchildren soon
[19:06] um as she's walking in back there
[19:09] um
[19:11] you the good the good things that you've
[19:13] done God can allot them then to your
[19:15] grandchildren and they could be blessed
[19:18] amen isn't that wonderful
[19:22] so Kane
[19:24] derived genetics
[19:27] from so let's go back to the beginning
[19:28] let's look at this process
[19:30] that happened in the Garden of Eden
[19:32] let's let's see how this follows Cain
[19:35] derived his genetics from The Serpent
[19:39] and Eve right
[19:41] so he had there's a little bit of his
[19:44] father The Serpent and a little bit of
[19:47] his mother Eve produced Cain
[19:50] Eve could be deceived because she was a
[19:53] byproduct of Adam right
[19:56] brother Branham we just read this the
[19:57] jeans and the father and the mother of
[19:59] this boy Remains the flesh that's been
[20:01] been innerbred out to this boy so genes
[20:04] of the father and the mother go into the
[20:08] child it's not just the genes of the
[20:10] father
[20:11] both father and mother
[20:13] so then we have Abel and Seth
[20:16] who are they they have the genes of Adam
[20:19] and Eve
[20:20] so if Eve could be deceived then so
[20:23] could Seth right
[20:25] because she's passing on that genetics
[20:28] to him he can be deceived and brother
[20:30] Branham says this
[20:31] that the sons of God were deceived
[20:35] Genesis 6 2 that the sons of God saw the
[20:38] daughters of men that they were Fair
[20:40] and they took them wives of all which
[20:43] they chose now this is a huge
[20:46] uh point that people try to make that
[20:48] they say that the Elohim and and the
[20:51] daughters of men got together
[20:53] so they they think the Angels came down
[20:56] and produced children but we we see
[20:59] Jesus himself directly contradicting
[21:03] this scene that's not possible saying in
[21:05] the resurrection
[21:07] will be like the angels of heaven
[21:09] and we won't have children okay so how
[21:11] is this how does that become possible we
[21:14] we can't bring it that way we see that
[21:17] God is making a distinction between two
[21:19] seedlines which he did from the very
[21:22] beginning right there in Genesis chapter
[21:24] four and five he
[21:26] he spoke of the two different seed lines
[21:28] then we go to Genesis 6 and now we're
[21:31] talking about angels coming down
[21:34] and let's go a little bit further you
[21:36] have trouble with serpent seed
[21:39] that the devil came and incarnated
[21:42] a beast of the field that looked like
[21:45] man reason like man taught like man you
[21:47] have trouble with that idea but then you
[21:49] go to Genesis 6 and say Angels came down
[21:52] and had sex with with women and produce
[21:54] the Nephilim
[21:57] so you got it all flipped around you you
[21:59] if you see that in the beginning you'd
[22:02] have it right
[22:03] where the serpent got together with Eve
[22:06] and produced Cain here we see two seed
[22:08] lines the whole this whole thing is
[22:10] talking to us about seed lines if you
[22:13] read Genesis Genesis 4 and Genesis 5 you
[22:16] have Genesis 4 showing us what
[22:19] Keynes line
[22:20] worldly evil angry polygamous Etc then
[22:25] you have Genesis 5 they began to call in
[22:27] the name of the Lord they were humble
[22:28] simple one of them gets raptured up
[22:30] because he's walking so close with God
[22:32] God takes him
[22:34] and so you see that seed line now you're
[22:36] going to Genesis 6 and we're talking
[22:38] about angels
[22:40] come on it's not difficult to understand
[22:43] Adam was a son of God
[22:46] what were his children then sons of God
[22:50] so the sons of God
[22:52] that's uh that's uh Seth's line
[22:56] comes together with Cain's line
[23:00] and they took wives and they produced a
[23:03] hybrid
[23:04] brother Branham says in the God of this
[23:06] evil age notice the sons of God saw the
[23:08] daughters of men not Daughters of God
[23:09] the daughters of men that they were
[23:11] beautiful and it caused the sons of God
[23:13] to fall into this delusion
[23:17] so they were deluded they were deceived
[23:21] because they had the attributes of their
[23:22] mother she could be deceived pass it on
[23:24] to the children we can all be deceived
[23:26] right
[23:26] any of you here that can't be deceived
[23:28] somehow
[23:30] well the elect won't be deceived amen
[23:32] but you got to have a you gotta add
[23:33] something foreign to us
[23:35] something outside of us a different life
[23:38] the baptism of the true baptism of the
[23:40] Holy Ghost and the Soul then we have the
[23:43] ingredients to never be deceived doesn't
[23:45] mean we don't make mistakes don't
[23:46] doesn't mean we don't go into error But
[23:49] ultimately when the word the true word
[23:51] is manifested we say Amen to it
[23:53] because there's something in our hearts
[23:55] that that can receive it
[23:58] spoken word is the Original Seed then
[24:00] except a man be born again why must he
[24:02] be born again he's dead with the flesh
[24:04] he's in he's a hybrid he's got to be
[24:07] born again why he was born in Sin from
[24:09] Eve's sin shaped an iniquity come to the
[24:11] world speaking lies so we see that we're
[24:14] all hybrid where were we hybrid at
[24:17] we were hybrid in Genesis chapter 6.
[24:21] the whole human race and we see that
[24:23] this just by the nature of the sons of
[24:26] Noah you see that it is a fact we're all
[24:29] hybrid they had some sons that were
[24:32] Godly some sons that were ungodly but
[24:35] what did they produce what did their
[24:37] entire what did they produce they and
[24:39] their wives a world of evil
[24:42] they went straight to Babel
[24:46] and only a few stood and resisted
[24:48] against that evil
[24:51] so we're all in this condition of hybrid
[24:54] and as I said before that is not merely
[24:57] talking about your flesh
[24:59] it's your it's your body it's your
[25:01] spirit it's your soul all three parts
[25:05] come genetically from your parents and
[25:08] so this hybridization that we can get in
[25:10] our soul
[25:11] spiritual aspect of us that's passing
[25:14] down
[25:14] from our parents
[25:16] so it's a mixed race a hybrid race I
[25:18] want to skip over that last part that I
[25:20] have in there
[25:21] but this whole this whole serpent seed
[25:24] nature is there
[25:28] in you and me
[25:30] that's where that evil nature comes from
[25:32] that's where that Fallen nature comes
[25:34] from if the serpent seed would have been
[25:36] slid to the side and there would never
[25:39] have been any hybridization that took
[25:41] place within the human race we would all
[25:43] be born subject to be deceived
[25:46] subject to sin right but yet we would
[25:49] have all had that nature to recognize
[25:51] when the word of God was manifested all
[25:54] of us because that that that breeding
[25:57] would have went to the side but it
[25:58] didn't it was all mixed and hybrid and
[26:00] that's what we have today is a mixed
[26:03] hybrid human race and we see right there
[26:07] in John 8 37.
[26:11] I know that you are Abraham's Sperma
[26:14] seed but you seek to kill me because my
[26:17] word has no place in you Jesus
[26:19] acknowledges physically speaking you
[26:22] come from Abraham physically spiritually
[26:25] speaking both of them you come from
[26:27] Abraham
[26:28] because my word has but you seek to kill
[26:30] me because my word has no place in you
[26:31] they answered and said unto him Abraham
[26:34] is our father Jesus saith unto him if
[26:35] you're Abraham's children now he uses a
[26:38] different word if you were Abraham's
[26:39] tecton sons
[26:41] a relationship with a bond in other
[26:44] words if you had Abraham's nature in you
[26:47] you would do the works of Abraham
[26:50] but you're of your father the devil and
[26:52] the lust of your father you will do he
[26:54] was a murderer from the beginning and
[26:55] Abode not in the truth because there's
[26:57] no truth in him when he speaks a lie he
[27:00] speaks of his own for he is a liar and
[27:02] the father of it so in the midst of
[27:04] Israel you have Abraham's seed
[27:07] who are of the devil
[27:09] and then you have Abraham's seed who are
[27:11] also his sons
[27:13] his technon and they have a place
[27:16] in them for the word right there right
[27:19] there we understand it's a hybrid race
[27:21] it's a genetically mixed race
[27:25] by the way there's only one race
[27:27] if you didn't know that already it's the
[27:30] human race
[27:32] calling all kinds of this race and this
[27:34] color race and this call that's human
[27:36] invention that has nothing to do with
[27:39] the word of God look it up what brother
[27:40] Madam says there's one race
[27:43] so let's let's look at this I'm really
[27:46] short on time but I feel like it I would
[27:49] have to re-preach everything I just said
[27:51] in order to get to this point so from
[27:55] genome.gov you can look at dominant and
[27:57] recessive genes so dominant refers the
[28:00] to the relationship between two versions
[28:02] of a gene individuals receive two
[28:05] versions of each gene known as I don't
[28:07] know how to say this and I don't know
[28:09] the details
[28:11] alleles from each parent if the alleles
[28:14] of a gene are different one allele will
[28:16] be expressed it's the dominant gene the
[28:19] effect of the other allele called
[28:20] recessive is Mast so I think if you are
[28:25] spiritual and you're reading this you
[28:27] could see what I was just saying right
[28:29] in the same family from the same mom and
[28:31] dad you have Esau and Jacob
[28:34] right
[28:36] one has a dominant gene of the genes of
[28:39] God one has a recessive gene there then
[28:43] you go on go on go on and guess what
[28:45] there's predestinated seed from Esau's
[28:47] line
[28:48] that recognize and receive the word of
[28:50] God today
[28:52] so how is that possible because it's
[28:55] past it continues to be passed on in a
[28:57] it's either dominant or it's recessive
[29:01] foreign
[29:04] says in the literal discharge of the
[29:07] male there's somewhat a million germs
[29:09] come forth from the male at each time
[29:12] and from a million eggs comes from the
[29:15] female at the same time but did you know
[29:16] in all of them little germs moving
[29:19] around a million of them there's only
[29:21] one of them ordained to life and there's
[29:23] only one egg fertile
[29:26] and that little germ will crawl right up
[29:28] through every one of them other little
[29:30] germs right over the top of every little
[29:32] germ looking just like him and come over
[29:34] the top of that and come over here and
[29:36] find that fertile egg and crawl into it
[29:38] and then all of the rest of them die why
[29:41] talk about a virgin birth oh it's not
[29:43] half as mysterious as a physical birth
[29:46] how it's foreordained predestinated by
[29:48] God it's it's incredible what brother
[29:50] Branham said he's saying that
[29:52] a child being born the very sperm that's
[29:56] supposed to fertilize the egg is
[29:58] predestinated by God so you see the
[30:01] depths of that because all the genes
[30:03] genetics is affected by that process
[30:08] now in the beginning way back way years
[30:10] ago before there was a time began you if
[30:13] you're a born-again Christian tonight
[30:14] you were in God then your father that's
[30:17] why when you come into this life here
[30:19] and profess Christianity well everything
[30:21] going wrong you've wondered why this is
[30:23] and all this it you you wondered at it
[30:25] but one day something struck you what
[30:27] was it the life that was down in there
[30:30] from the beginning
[30:32] like my little story about the eagle
[30:34] finding it everyone's very familiar with
[30:36] this but I it's important to understand
[30:38] in the context it's mother finding the
[30:41] eagle you've heard me preach on that how
[30:43] that little Eagle was hatched under a
[30:45] hen but she her habits of trying to feed
[30:47] them them chickens the little Eagle
[30:48] couldn't stomach it because he wasn't a
[30:50] chicken to begin with
[30:53] yet he was in the pen with the chickens
[30:55] and followed the chicken but she would
[30:56] scratch in the barnyard and things and
[30:59] the little Eagle couldn't stand it but
[31:00] every time she would cluck in everything
[31:01] all the little chickens go so he would
[31:04] go too but one day
[31:06] his mother knew that she had laid two
[31:08] eggs not one there had to be another one
[31:10] somewhere she went to hunt it flying
[31:12] around circling finally she come over
[31:14] the Barnyard and she found her baby and
[31:16] she screamed to him it was a voice that
[31:18] he realized that that's the thing that
[31:20] fit
[31:21] that was what he's looking for see he he
[31:24] realized then that he wasn't a chicken
[31:26] he was an eagle
[31:29] and that that eagle can be born under
[31:32] any and let's expand it what we're
[31:34] talking about an eagle can be born in
[31:35] any family anywhere any place on this
[31:39] earth right now any color skin
[31:42] any religion any place and it's our duty
[31:46] to go find it how can that be brother
[31:47] Jason you just we just explained that
[31:50] sometimes it's dominant sometimes it's
[31:52] recessive it can be recessive for
[31:54] Generations upon Generations upon
[31:55] Generations all of a sudden it's active
[31:58] why do you think that all of a sudden
[31:59] all these Gentiles are being saved and
[32:02] they weren't saved before
[32:04] where did that how did that come from
[32:05] did they somehow just get Jewish blood
[32:08] in them it has nothing to do with it
[32:10] it's there it's there from the very from
[32:14] the very from the flood going on
[32:18] I'm gonna skip this one
[32:22] and uh just got a few more minutes I'm
[32:25] going to take every
[32:26] ounce of my allotted time
[32:29] from the spoken word is the original
[32:31] season now notice now in this God
[32:33] foresaw and predestinated a world of
[32:35] sons and daughters he predestinated them
[32:38] to be there and because of high breeding
[32:40] disbelieving God's word caused the high
[32:42] breeding God has put it right back again
[32:45] that you don't have to be hybrid anymore
[32:48] you can come right back to the original
[32:50] word and be a Son of God just like you
[32:52] were supposed to be at the beginning
[32:55] Christ couldn't help being what he was
[32:56] he was the son of God that's it see what
[32:58] I mean now see if you were intended you
[33:01] see the word of God you believe it
[33:02] because why
[33:04] there's something new see why have you
[33:06] ever heard of a strain in a family one a
[33:09] son will kind of impersonate his father
[33:12] or the mother or the grandfather
[33:13] grandmother that strain in the family
[33:16] you've heard of it haven't you well
[33:18] that's the same thing from
[33:19] predestination see what brother
[33:21] branham's trying to say there's a strain
[33:22] in the family there's something being
[33:24] passed down in the genetics of the human
[33:27] race and all of a sudden it comes and
[33:30] you're you you can recognize the word
[33:32] well I'll let him finish
[33:33] well that's the same thing from
[33:35] predestination you were supposed to be
[33:37] here in the right way at the beginning
[33:39] so what does that mean he's referring
[33:41] back to if there had never been a fall
[33:43] you to come forth by the spoken word
[33:45] through Adam and Eve and and you would
[33:48] have you would that the whole family of
[33:50] God would have been here but instead it
[33:52] was hybrid and we have a huge population
[33:54] and in there one here and one there is
[33:57] predestinated by God to come forth but
[33:59] you were supposed to come forth in the
[34:01] beginning
[34:03] predestinated you hear the word it
[34:04] brings you right back to where you were
[34:06] predestinated amen never saw that before
[34:08] it brings you right what makes you
[34:10] believe the word of God and turn down
[34:11] these other things it's because you were
[34:14] there something in you way back Yonder
[34:17] What You're Made to live here forever
[34:20] amen
[34:23] all right so in closing down to the very
[34:26] sperm and egg level your genetics are
[34:30] predetermined
[34:31] so DNA is the sum total of the DNA of
[34:34] all of your mothers and fathers and
[34:36] sisters
[34:37] then this is passed from the Garden of
[34:39] Eden all the way to us today but due to
[34:42] the mixing of the two lines all are born
[34:44] in a hybrid condition some are born with
[34:48] the genetics of God dominant and within
[34:50] their spiritual DNA and some are born
[34:52] with it in a res in as recessive
[34:55] but the new birth is what quickens that
[34:57] spear
