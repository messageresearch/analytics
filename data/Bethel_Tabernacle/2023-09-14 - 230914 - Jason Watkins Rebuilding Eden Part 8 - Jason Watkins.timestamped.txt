[34:13] we're trusting the Lord tonight to

[34:19] part eight it's not was not my intention
[34:21] actually
[34:23] um to preach uh to continue this series
[34:26] tonight I had actually went to bed last
[34:30] night with another thought in mind and
[34:33] woke up
[34:34] um
[34:35] with that same thought and then went to
[34:37] study and
[34:39] Lord just wouldn't have it so we're
[34:41] going to carry on tonight amen praise
[34:43] the Lord want you to be praying for me
[34:45] I'll be ministering away in Colombia
[34:47] this weekend the meetings there in
[34:49] Swansea brother Benny Perry and uh the
[34:52] various churches in that area so you'd
[34:55] be praying for me can I count on you to
[34:57] do that amen praise the Lord if you want
[34:59] to come up Friday and Saturday and visit
[35:00] drop in on the meetings I think we
[35:03] posted the flyer amen but make sure
[35:06] you're here at your posted Duty on
[35:08] Sunday morning Amen brother Matt I'll be
[35:09] covering base for me praise the Lord
[35:14] um Philippians chapter 3
[35:17] verses 10 through 19 will will let you
[35:20] uh actually we're just going to read
[35:22] 1011 and then I'll let you be seated and
[35:25] then we'll finish reading with you
[35:26] seated
[35:28] um Philippians 3 verse 10 my favorite
[35:31] passage in the Bible
[35:33] but I may know him
[35:36] and the power of his resurrection
[35:39] and the fellowship of his sufferings
[35:42] being made conformable unto his death
[35:45] love verse 11 if I love verse 10 but 11
[35:49] is what really adds a real Finishing
[35:53] Touch to to the 10th verse if by any
[35:55] means I might attain unto the
[35:58] resurrection of the Dead for a little
[36:00] more clarity the NLT reads that so that
[36:04] one way or another I will experience the
[36:07] resurrection from the dead one way or
[36:09] another whatever it takes I want to know
[36:13] him and the power of his resurrection
[36:16] now that's two different things there
[36:18] there's a conjunction it's not knowing
[36:20] in the power although brother Branham
[36:22] used it that way there's an application
[36:24] of that but he also brother Branham also
[36:27] preached it just like it's written I
[36:29] want to know him and the power of his
[36:32] resurrection and the fellowship of his
[36:35] sufferings being made conformable unto
[36:39] his death so that one way or another
[36:42] I will experience the resurrection from
[36:44] the dead let's pray
[36:46] father we thank you for your word
[36:48] tonight and I thank you for this
[36:50] opportunity Lord to stand here and come
[36:54] under your anointing Lord to minister
[36:56] the gospel I pray you be with me Lord

[37:04] it's all fresh I was forced to write
[37:07] completely new notes for this eighth
[37:09] part Lord and what was going to be part

[37:19] myself into your hands Lord in Jesus
[37:22] name amen God bless you as you're seated
[37:25] and keep your Bibles ready we're going
[37:27] to continue reading
[37:30] because now beginning in verse 12 we
[37:34] come to what what what probably is in
[37:38] your Bible there might be a chapter
[37:40] notation there this is the part where
[37:43] Paul begins to talk about the High
[37:45] Calling of God now that High Calling our
[37:48] first thing I want you to get in your
[37:50] Minds tonight this is a Monumental point
[37:53] because this is really an anchor point
[37:56] if I could say that to everything I've
[37:59] been constantly preaching in the
[38:02] previous seven parts you've heard me say
[38:04] again and again that this whole series
[38:07] is primarily to believers
[38:11] hey man I'm it's primarily to people who
[38:15] testify that they have given their heart
[38:17] to Christ they testify that they have
[38:20] been filled with the Holy Spirit they
[38:22] testify that they have set Amen to every
[38:24] word if that's you then this series is
[38:27] for you amen because it is the Believers
[38:32] that have been called to the High
[38:35] Calling of God we know that brother
[38:37] Branham said only the predestinated are
[38:41] considered in Redemption and since
[38:43] Redemption uh is is what we're after uh
[38:47] then you can see certainly that election
[38:50] then is based on uh you know it's
[38:53] genealogy it's the gene seed of almighty
[38:57] God a true election don't ever forget
[39:00] that true election is based on Origin as
[39:05] Jesus said I you know he the Bible said
[39:08] Jesus knowing that he came from God and
[39:10] went to God Amen and so we realize that
[39:14] the great principle of the High Calling
[39:18] of God now you believers
[39:20] do you feel the High Calling do you feel
[39:22] the challenge of the High Calling upon
[39:25] you listen you don't have to you you
[39:28] don't look at the High Calling as
[39:31] somewhere in outer space that you just
[39:34] you just want to give up on you say I'm
[39:36] just got too many problems and I'll
[39:38] never a high calling are you kidding I
[39:41] can barely Hang On Now understand that
[39:44] the world has fallen so far under you
[39:46] you're in the High Calling if you're
[39:49] standing
[39:50] so how many are standing as a Believer
[39:53] say I've got weaknesses I have ups and
[39:56] downs I do have problems but I'm still
[39:59] standing
[40:01] then you are living in the High Calling
[40:05] see
[40:06] it's really the high calling is really
[40:09] part and parcel of the great principle
[40:12] of spiritual warfare that is in fact
[40:16] what spiritual warfare is all about what
[40:20] spiritual warfare all about Pastor the
[40:23] high calling and you achieving that
[40:26] position
[40:27] not living under your privileges as sons
[40:31] of God you're not warring very
[40:33] successfully if you're if you don't have
[40:36] access to the all the power of God
[40:38] because I'm here to tell you it's for
[40:41] you it is you you can have it
[40:45] all it takes is war with the love of God
[40:50] in your heart amen now so Paul goes on
[40:53] to say
[40:55] echoing what I've just said not as
[40:57] though I had already attained either
[41:00] we're already perfect amen where's my
[41:03] verse on the screen guys yeah verse 12.
[41:05] amen not as though I had already
[41:08] attained either were already perfect but
[41:12] I follow after
[41:14] how many paulins we got here tonight
[41:18] say like Paul said I uh Paul amen Paul
[41:21] you're you're you're speaking my
[41:23] language brother I I I don't I I I not
[41:27] as though I had already attained either
[41:30] or were already perfect but I follow
[41:33] after if that I may apprehend that for
[41:37] which also I am apprehended why do you
[41:39] why are why are you following because
[41:41] Christ has apprehended me to the high
[41:44] calling and I don't think I've quite
[41:47] reached my perfection but I'm fighting
[41:50] the fight of faith
[41:53] this is what's important
[41:55] verse 13 Brethren I count not myself to
[41:59] have apprehended but this one thing I do
[42:02] I can't get I can't do a whole lot but I
[42:05] got one thing I can do I can defeat the
[42:07] Devil how are you going to defeat him
[42:10] forgetting those things which are behind
[42:14] I have failures well I I'm not sure I
[42:18] have because I've forgotten them
[42:21] say if you ever failed I don't know
[42:25] I don't really remember it say well
[42:27] you're you're insane you kind of Amen
[42:30] I'm just believing God's word and and
[42:33] and although in my flesh I don't
[42:35] necessarily feel but here's what I can
[42:36] do I can forget what is behind and I and
[42:41] when I do that when I forget what is
[42:43] behind then reaching forth unto those
[42:46] things which are before maybe I didn't
[42:49] meet the grade yesterday but it's ahead
[42:52] of me for today it's ahead of me again
[42:55] for tomorrow his mercies are new every
[42:58] morning
[43:00] Hallelujah
[43:02] see
[43:03] if if the devil could have one success
[43:06] and it would be to bring you to church
[43:08] tonight just to keep you in the failures
[43:10] of yesterday
[43:12] if he can do that all my preaching is
[43:15] worthless
[43:15] because you because the word has to be
[43:17] mixed with faith see in them that hear
[43:20] it
[43:21] so Paul says what do I do see I reach
[43:24] forth unto those things which are before
[43:26] I press that means stretch that means
[43:29] strain that means you know I press
[43:31] toward I'm reaching as far as I can
[43:33] toward the mark for the prize of the
[43:37] High Calling of God in Christ Jesus you
[43:40] know the beauty of it is is that because
[43:43] that the predestinated only the only the
[43:48] predestinated are considered in
[43:49] Redemption then then because that I have
[43:52] been redeemed then then then I uniquely
[43:56] have the ability to make the mark
[44:02] say how do you do you know you'll make
[44:05] it well I know I can
[44:07] I know it's for me I know he has
[44:10] supplied me see I know he won't push me
[44:13] through a pipe
[44:15] he won't push me through a mold and just
[44:17] pull me out and say what a wonderful
[44:18] Overcomer I gotta fight
[44:22] where how many are willing to fight
[44:25] tonight and say I want everything in my
[44:27] inheritance
[44:30] see
[44:33] so let us therefore as many as be
[44:36] perfect be thus minded
[44:39] see he just admitted he wasn't perfect
[44:41] In the Flesh so now he's admitting that
[44:43] we are perfect in Christ
[44:45] let us therefore as many as be perfect
[44:47] be thus minded and if anything you
[44:50] otherwise you are you'll be otherwise
[44:52] minded God shall reveal even this to you
[44:55] what a statement of Grace Paul is saying
[44:57] if you disagree well you know if you if
[45:00] you have a hard time believing what I'm
[45:02] telling you about yourself God will make
[45:05] it plain
[45:07] breathe it'll be all right God will make
[45:10] it plain I'll keep telling you that
[45:13] you're the Flawless spotless bride of
[45:15] Jesus Christ until you believe it
[45:17] amen because you're going to see the
[45:19] effects of believing it here in a minute
[45:21] see nevertheless
[45:24] we're in two we have already attained
[45:28] that's an important verse it's a super
[45:31] important we're going to break down
[45:32] verse 16 just in a little bit so be
[45:36] ready getting in a little bit after you
[45:37] take the scripture down I'm going to
[45:38] need that 16th verse again now watch
[45:41] real close verse 16 nevertheless
[45:44] believers
[45:46] bride elect lady redeemed
[45:50] predestinated
[45:52] right nevertheless where unto we
[45:56] have already attained let us walk by the
[45:59] same rule let us mind the same thing see
[46:04] the NLT says we must hold on to the
[46:07] progress we have already made
[46:11] so don't
[46:12] Don't Drift
[46:14] don't slide back
[46:18] you understand now here's an interesting
[46:20] thing about backsliding if you if you
[46:23] because the world is moving toward more
[46:28] and more sin every day
[46:31] and moving toward more and more Insanity
[46:34] every day moving to more and more toward
[46:36] perversion every day
[46:38] so so it's it's moving brother Branham
[46:40] said it's it's it's headed for a
[46:43] destruction you can't stop it you can't
[46:46] turn it around you can't even slow it
[46:48] down the world is moving now get on a
[46:51] moving treadmill uh and and I'm here to
[46:55] tell you if you don't walk you'll go
[46:58] backwards
[47:01] understand so you don't have to run out
[47:04] here to The Honky Tonk to backslide just
[47:07] stop cut your prayer life in half cut
[47:09] your church attendance in half just stop
[47:12] doing spiritual things and you'll bless
[47:14] you'll slide backwards because the world
[47:17] is moving toward evil
[47:19] so you have to press you have to
[47:22] constantly constantly go forward go
[47:25] forward go forward see
[47:28] for many walk verse 18. see verse 17
[47:32] brethren
[47:33] be followers together of me and mark
[47:36] them which walks so as you see as you
[47:40] have us for an example I'm so glad Paul
[47:43] could say that he was an example to the
[47:45] church for many of whom I have told you
[47:48] often and now tell you even weeping that
[47:52] they are the enemies of the Cross of
[47:53] Christ
[47:54] who's in this destruction whose God is
[47:57] their belly and whose glory is in their
[48:00] shame who mind Earthly things you know
[48:02] what they stop doing they stop pressing
[48:05] see
[48:07] you know
[48:08] this is such a description of today
[48:12] who have become enemies of the Cross
[48:14] whose end is destruction whose God is
[48:17] their own belly and whose glory is their
[48:19] own shame who mind Earthly things I mean
[48:22] that's why you know I'm you know I'll
[48:25] just tell you you remember several
[48:26] Services ago and we showed some
[48:29] different musical artists on the screen
[48:31] over here we showed Hillsong
[48:33] particularly you know I really was very
[48:35] kind I was actually very kind and and
[48:39] and didn't Linger on it I could have
[48:41] really brought forth you know I I'm not
[48:44] a newsman I'm a preacher but I but I I
[48:47] could have brought forth almost a
[48:49] documentary level uh of a debauchery
[48:52] among that Hillsong movement if you
[48:55] would if you would ever study the
[48:57] Hillsong churches I mean at this point
[49:00] so many of them had to close down
[49:02] because of the failures of all their
[49:04] leadership
[49:05] and their and their pastors and they
[49:07] they started in Australia and and then
[49:11] that Pastor the founder he had a big
[49:13] fall and then the man that they set up
[49:14] in New York and I mean it's it's so bad
[49:19] that I couldn't show it
[49:24] because this man as the pastor actively
[49:29] I'm not talking about after he got
[49:31] caught in the sack with another woman
[49:33] I'm talking about before that while he's
[49:35] the active Pastor he's hanging out with
[49:38] rock stars he's drinking tequila at the
[49:41] bars he cusses jams out with with rock
[49:45] bands
[49:46] walks around in such vulgar clothing
[49:50] in public
[49:52] and the people loved him
[49:55] he was considered the Superstar Pastor
[49:57] in America
[49:59] and on you you could see interviews of
[50:01] him on on the on the major news channels
[50:04] he was like a Phenom
[50:05] and I mean he actually he he's so gross
[50:09] and so vulgar and so nasty and such an
[50:12] ungodly sinner
[50:14] and I'm just calling the fruit I'm
[50:16] calling the tree by the fruit
[50:18] that he literally makes Joel Osteen look
[50:21] like a Cub Scout I'll take I'll take 10
[50:24] Joel Osteen's instead of one of this guy
[50:27] so I'm just making a point friends that
[50:31] because you we said in a message church
[50:33] and you're somewhat sheltered from the
[50:35] world you ought to thank God that we had
[50:38] a Godly messenger who came in this day
[50:40] and he never fell to money or to women
[50:43] or to popularity and there was never an
[50:46] accusation against him
[50:48] a man who stayed clean in his life and
[50:51] humble before God
[50:53] and God manifested and you're the you're
[50:56] the result of that Ministry I've never
[50:58] been so happy to be a result of anything
[51:00] in my life
[51:02] I was showing you some of the results of
[51:05] that movement
[51:06] but this movement has produced the life
[51:09] of Jesus Christ
[51:11] don't be fooled friends the modern world
[51:13] of so-called Christianity is vulgar
[51:16] nasty and rotten gross
[51:19] see and I I don't hardly have enough
[51:21] words I could borrow a few Bible
[51:23] descriptions their tables are full of
[51:25] vomit
[51:27] they're fine they're they're they're
[51:28] harlots
[51:30] their mother's a
[51:33] say that's true man you're turning the
[51:36] air blue I'm just quoting the Bible
[51:38] that's all I'm doing don't lose sight of
[51:41] how blessed you are don't lose sight
[51:44] about glad you ought to be don't lose
[51:46] sight that you are know the truth and
[51:49] the truth has made you free
[51:51] well don't apologize for that that's the
[51:54] that's the flat truth that's the truth
[51:56] the world needs to hear they don't need
[51:58] to hear a watered down gospel they need
[52:00] to hear they're headed to a tribulation
[52:01] unless they repent
[52:09] the eighth part tonight this eighth
[52:11] installment in this series is all about
[52:13] this great
[52:14] principle of spiritual warfare for the
[52:17] believer
[52:19] we've been zeroing in on the
[52:22] what I consider to be the greatest
[52:24] existential threat
[52:27] to the true church
[52:30] of the last days
[52:33] and that is
[52:35] the Antichrist
[52:37] impersonation of Christianity within the
[52:41] framework of the Christian church
[52:45] see
[52:47] this is the threat we face
[52:50] don't think that that
[52:52] Antichrist Spirit of impersonation
[52:56] doesn't try to weed in Among Us
[53:00] he'll come right into your home right
[53:02] into your life if you let him the next
[53:05] thing you know you'll be you'll find
[53:07] yourself living with carnality and on
[53:09] the edge and you you you barely look
[53:12] like a a reformed sinner
[53:16] so he dress in ways that are absolutely
[53:19] contrary to the quotes on tape
[53:22] absolutely contrary
[53:24] to the quotes has anybody does does
[53:27] anybody remember that William Branham
[53:29] was against women painting their
[53:31] fingernails
[53:35] does anybody remember that
[53:37] does anybody remember that he was
[53:39] against women trimming their hair even
[53:41] trimming it
[53:43] do you do you remember that William
[53:46] Branham preached Holiness and women
[53:48] should dress holy
[53:50] and they shouldn't be half naked at the
[53:52] upper part of their body
[53:57] okay
[54:00] men shouldn't run around in shorts
[54:03] you shouldn't carouse and run around and
[54:05] and hang out with the wrong crowds
[54:07] because what will happen is you run with
[54:10] dogs you catch fleas
[54:13] see
[54:14] and I'm not speaking about people who
[54:17] can come to Christ I'm like God I would
[54:19] that all the whole world would come to
[54:21] Salvation
[54:22] I have that in my heart I preach I wish
[54:24] every man and woman would fall down on
[54:26] their knees tonight and repent and let
[54:29] Christ come into their life brother
[54:31] Branham said the Millennium could be on
[54:33] tomorrow if we do that
[54:36] so I I reject the ideology that I'm
[54:39] against people or that I shouldn't say
[54:41] hard things you should know I reject
[54:43] that kind of an idea I have the right to
[54:46] preach the bare-fisted gospel I believe
[54:49] it I live it and I have a right to
[54:51] minister it
[54:53] amen
[54:54] it's the plain truth
[54:58] the soul brother Adam talks about tight
[55:02] clothes and short skirts and you know if
[55:05] you're going to be a Christian then be
[55:06] one
[55:08] amen
[55:09] so we've been zeroing in on this great
[55:12] existential threat of the impersonation
[55:15] I call it the Antichrist impersonation
[55:17] of Christianity that's what brother
[55:19] Branham is going to refer to it as here
[55:21] in a minute
[55:23] so remember that we're not looking at it
[55:25] as a threat and I'm not preaching and
[55:28] this series isn't about looking at it as
[55:31] a threat to the false Church
[55:33] because the because the false church is
[55:36] just that it's false meaning it's not a
[55:40] real one
[55:42] there is only one real Church
[55:45] and that's the Holy Ghost Field Church
[55:47] that's it it's not it's so it's so so
[55:51] the false church is not the actual Body
[55:54] of Christ
[55:55] uh it's not the Virgin bride whom he
[55:59] comes to reproduce His Image in do you
[56:03] know that's why you're the Virgin bride
[56:05] of Christ so that he can reproduce His
[56:07] Image through you
[56:10] brother Branham says in the revelation
[56:12] of Jesus Christ and I'm debated whether
[56:15] to put these on the screen being
[56:16] Wednesday I decided against it plus I
[56:19] want to jump in and out of it so just
[56:20] stay right with me
[56:22] this is very familiar but I'm going to
[56:24] make some comments on it as we go
[56:26] so brother Branham says now remember
[56:28] this now pay attention everybody got me
[56:31] now remember this Christ
[56:34] in the true church
[56:36] is a continuation of the book of Acts
[56:39] the very fact that he says two true
[56:41] church shows there's a false one okay so
[56:43] he's got two different churches going
[56:45] here all right he's going to talk about
[56:47] an antichrist church and a Christ Church
[56:49] all right
[56:51] the the Christ in the true church is a
[56:55] continuation of the book of Acts but the
[56:59] Book of Revelation
[57:02] shows how that the Antichrist spirit
[57:06] would come into the church and defile it
[57:09] now watch because it's going to actually
[57:12] end up forming a false Church off of the
[57:15] true church you can you know it's the
[57:17] false Church by the by the
[57:18] characteristics he said he'll defile it
[57:21] making it lukewarm formal and Powerless
[57:25] the true church with the Holy Ghost is
[57:29] not lukewarm or formal or powerless
[57:33] the true church is a continuation of the
[57:37] book of Acts
[57:39] see
[57:41] it exposes The Book of Revelation it
[57:44] exposes Satan
[57:46] revealing his works now here is his
[57:49] Works ready
[57:51] attempted destruction of God's people
[57:57] and the discrediting of God's word
[58:02] you understand so my my my my my my uh
[58:06] concern is not for the false Church my
[58:10] concern is what he's trying to do to
[58:12] God's people and God's word he's trying
[58:16] to destroy God's people by discrediting
[58:20] God's word that's how he'll destroy you
[58:24] if he can discredit God's word in your
[58:27] mind if he can get you to look at a
[58:30] quote of William Branham and discredit
[58:32] that in your mind he will destroy you
[58:37] you are fortified behind the word of God
[58:42] see
[58:46] so it's discredited in God's word he
[58:48] does it right down to the time he has
[58:50] cast into the Lake of Fire so just plan
[58:53] to fight to the Finish Line
[58:55] come on friends you have to fight to the
[58:57] Finish Line now you'll be no vacations
[58:59] we're not getting any time off you have
[59:01] to fight to the Finish Line I just say
[59:04] Lord then bring on the Finish Line bring
[59:05] on the fight Hallelujah
[59:09] he fights that see Revelations he fights
[59:13] it he cannot stand it he knows that if
[59:18] the people now this is the true bride
[59:20] you can see by the characteristics
[59:22] remember the characteristics identify
[59:24] the false church lukewar and formal and
[59:26] Powerless now he's going to identify the
[59:27] true bride see Satan cannot stand
[59:30] Revelation he knows that if the people
[59:33] the true bride get the true Revelation
[59:36] because she's the only one who can the
[59:38] true revelation of the true church and
[59:41] what she is
[59:45] now I'm gonna I'm gonna make you go
[59:49] along with me on this you ready
[59:53] if the true bride gets the true
[59:56] revelation of the true church and what
[59:59] she is
[1:00:01] Who You Are
[1:00:04] Who You Are
[1:00:06] if the true bride gets a true revelation
[1:00:09] of the true church and who you are
[1:00:12] if you can understand who the true
[1:00:14] church is and who you are
[1:00:17] what she stands for what you stand for
[1:00:22] how many know what we stand for
[1:00:25] do you realize that Faith a revelation
[1:00:27] of who you are and what we stand for is
[1:00:30] what defeats the devil
[1:00:32] and that she you
[1:00:36] can do the Greater Works
[1:00:39] she you will be an invincible Army
[1:00:45] Hallelujah
[1:00:48] if they we
[1:00:51] get a true revelation of the two Spirits
[1:00:55] within the framework of the Christian
[1:00:57] church and by God's spirit catch it and
[1:01:00] by God's spirit discern and withstand
[1:01:03] the Antichrist Spirit if we discern and
[1:01:07] withstand the Antichrist Spirit if we
[1:01:11] discern and withstand the Antichrist
[1:01:14] Spirit then Satan will be powerless
[1:01:17] before her Satan will be powerless
[1:01:21] before us Satan he'll be powerless
[1:01:24] before me say he'll be powerless before
[1:01:27] me because God only needs one person
[1:01:33] he Satan
[1:01:36] will be as definitely thwarted today
[1:01:40] as when Christ withstood his every
[1:01:43] effort to gain power over him in the
[1:01:45] desert yes Satan hates revelation
[1:01:50] and now brother Branham does it for us I
[1:01:53] don't have to do it
[1:01:54] Satan hates Revelation but we love it
[1:01:58] with true Revelation in our lives
[1:02:02] the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against
[1:02:05] us
[1:02:06] but we will prevail over them
[1:02:12] demon power Gates of Hell demon power
[1:02:14] say how many demons all of them
[1:02:17] all of them I have given you power over
[1:02:19] all the power of the devil
[1:02:22] Hallelujah
[1:02:25] so can you now see the danger you see
[1:02:28] what I'm preaching on
[1:02:30] see we've got to discern and withstand
[1:02:35] now
[1:02:36] you're all you're almost having it done
[1:02:38] for you because you've got faithful
[1:02:40] Ministry
[1:02:42] who are gifted to rightly divide the
[1:02:44] word
[1:02:45] and we're following a prophet's message
[1:02:48] so I I promise you you can rely on what
[1:02:52] you're hearing
[1:02:53] we're
[1:02:54] pointing things to you
[1:02:56] to avoid
[1:02:58] yes you say oh you're just meddling in
[1:03:01] our lives trying to tell us how to live
[1:03:03] no kidding it's what I do
[1:03:07] that's what I do it's what you pay me
[1:03:09] for
[1:03:12] you pay me to hurt you I'm sorry
[1:03:20] your money's not worth it to me to for
[1:03:23] the pain I go through hurting you but
[1:03:25] it's a duty before God
[1:03:28] so now you can see why tonight is part
[1:03:30] eight and parts nine and ten are waiting
[1:03:33] in the wings
[1:03:34] now watch now
[1:03:38] when when brother Branham
[1:03:40] was shown
[1:03:42] a preview of The Bride you remember that
[1:03:46] and he saw the true the the true church
[1:03:50] and then he saw you know the the
[1:03:52] churches from America Church from all
[1:03:54] over the world and it's got worse and
[1:03:56] worse and worse till it got to the last
[1:03:57] which was uh the Church of America
[1:04:01] and that was the most horrible of them
[1:04:03] all which makes sense because the
[1:04:05] lightning traveled from these to the
[1:04:06] west and it's all heaped up right here
[1:04:08] see
[1:04:10] so so we we find that when he was shown
[1:04:14] a preview of The Bride
[1:04:16] you remember when the bride came around
[1:04:19] he they said the now the bride must
[1:04:21] because brother Brandon was so destroyed
[1:04:23] over looking at the church
[1:04:25] and he said goodness all my preaching
[1:04:27] and all my brother and all of us
[1:04:29] ministers and all the revivals and he
[1:04:31] thought of Africa and he thought of
[1:04:33] India and he thought of Scandinavian
[1:04:34] countries and he seven times around the
[1:04:36] world and oh my goodness and and this is
[1:04:39] the best we could do he said I was
[1:04:41] embarrassed I didn't want to look he
[1:04:42] said he was standing right here and he
[1:04:44] said I was so embarrassed to think this
[1:04:46] is the best we could offer him uh a
[1:04:48] church naked
[1:04:51] following a witch
[1:04:53] dancing to rock and roll
[1:04:56] and that's the best that we could offer
[1:04:58] and he was so destroyed and he said
[1:05:02] that voice said now the bride must come
[1:05:05] in to review again
[1:05:07] because the lightning from the East is
[1:05:09] now in the West
[1:05:11] and then when the bride comes along and
[1:05:13] brother Branham said saintly bunch of
[1:05:15] little girls smooth clean all of them
[1:05:19] had long hair down their back all of
[1:05:22] them dressed decently said beautiful
[1:05:24] clean they weren't all filled full of
[1:05:27] Max Factor
[1:05:29] and and all kinds of makeup trying to
[1:05:31] make them beautiful they had the beauty
[1:05:33] of holiness
[1:05:36] but brother Branham noticed two or three
[1:05:38] right at the end time
[1:05:42] right the last Representatives
[1:05:46] and they were getting out of Step
[1:05:48] see and so brother Branham observed
[1:05:52] that the great threat to the Bride of
[1:05:56] the last age at the end of the line was
[1:05:59] that she allowed herself to get out of
[1:06:01] Step by watching that false Church
[1:06:07] what he says he said she she got to
[1:06:09] watching that false church and saw them
[1:06:12] going into destruction and she got
[1:06:14] gazing at that and the things you you
[1:06:16] you're transformed into what you gaze at
[1:06:18] that's scripture the things you gaze at
[1:06:20] you get transformed into that it it
[1:06:22] affects you and they got they got gazing
[1:06:25] at that and they ended up you know they
[1:06:28] they they they right right near at the
[1:06:31] end of the line allowing herself to get
[1:06:34] out of Step watching that false church
[1:06:36] and she almost like began to you know
[1:06:40] it's almost like it looks like the true
[1:06:41] church has got little fringes of wow or
[1:06:45] are are believers trying to pattern
[1:06:48] after the false Church
[1:06:51] what I thought we were believers
[1:06:55] I thought we didn't dress like that and
[1:06:57] act like that and go to those places and
[1:06:59] do those things I thought Believers had
[1:07:01] a different standard
[1:07:04] I thought Believers didn't compromise
[1:07:07] like that false Church see
[1:07:10] the display of lewdness and
[1:07:13] vulgarity and
[1:07:15] nakedness of the false Church driven by
[1:07:18] evil spirits that that brother Branham
[1:07:21] said it's evil spirits that teach women
[1:07:24] to strip their clothes off men too
[1:07:28] men too I mean that Pastor I was telling
[1:07:30] you about has a picture where he's in
[1:07:32] shorts and no shirt but I I couldn't
[1:07:35] show it because it is so unbelievably
[1:07:38] vulgar
[1:07:39] it made me blush and I'm a dude it made
[1:07:42] me blush
[1:07:44] and I and I and I felt incense that he
[1:07:46] called himself a minister of the Gospel
[1:07:49] because I gotta face that out here and
[1:07:51] people go oh what do you do I'm a
[1:07:53] preacher oh boy
[1:07:54] hey don't don't associate me with that
[1:07:57] or that kind of stuff's going straight
[1:07:59] to the Lake of Fire
[1:08:01] we have nothing to do with that kind of
[1:08:03] stuff we believe in Holiness under God
[1:08:07] cheap
[1:08:08] brother Branham said it's like like
[1:08:11] Legion in the Bible Legion stripped his
[1:08:13] clothes off of him
[1:08:15] so that's an evil spirit sister brother
[1:08:18] brother sister that's an evil spirit
[1:08:20] driving you to show Too Much flesh
[1:08:24] that's an evil spirit says hiking those
[1:08:26] skirts up that's an evil spirit brother
[1:08:28] for walking around in those shorts
[1:08:31] that's an evil spirit that's an evil
[1:08:33] spirit Brothers to have bangs
[1:08:35] hanging down in your face
[1:08:37] brother Brandon said that's a spirit
[1:08:41] that's a feminist Spirit you might be as
[1:08:44] manly as all get out but there's a
[1:08:46] feminist Spirit working
[1:08:50] see
[1:08:52] so the worldly and and so that that
[1:08:54] lewdness that nakedness of the false
[1:08:57] church that vulgarity the worldly rhythm
[1:09:01] of the false Church which brother
[1:09:03] Branham you remember in 1964 in Shalom
[1:09:06] brother Branham attributes it to to
[1:09:09] Lifestyles that don't move in harmony
[1:09:12] with the original composer he talks
[1:09:15] about sympathy and Symphony and I I'll
[1:09:18] read you the the statement here in a
[1:09:19] second
[1:09:20] so this this worldly Rhythm there
[1:09:23] brother Branham said you know they're
[1:09:24] moving and they're dancing and they got
[1:09:26] their music going and you know and and
[1:09:28] these are supposed to be lives it's
[1:09:31] representing the false church and
[1:09:32] they're supposed to have lives that are
[1:09:35] in sympathetic Harmony
[1:09:37] they're in sympathetic resonance with
[1:09:39] the with the conductor how he wrote
[1:09:42] brother Brown said this is the sheet
[1:09:43] music and the and and and the conductor
[1:09:46] wrote it like he wants it played
[1:09:49] but this isn't something that these guys
[1:09:51] get on and do this is something all of
[1:09:53] you do you're an instrument you this is
[1:09:56] sheet music that you play in your lives
[1:10:00] amen
[1:10:02] and so this was the problem they they
[1:10:04] had their lives were so you know
[1:10:07] Lifestyles born of of insincere
[1:10:09] repentance towards God and you know join
[1:10:12] the church and shake the preacher's hand
[1:10:14] that's all you need to do but effective
[1:10:16] change and Holiness simply aren't
[1:10:18] necessary
[1:10:20] Asiana Christ Church brother Brandon
[1:10:22] says in shalom can't you see my
[1:10:25] brother's sister it's got to be in
[1:10:27] harmony
[1:10:28] the director has got to be with the word
[1:10:31] when it says one thing don't say
[1:10:33] something else it'll give the wrong sign
[1:10:35] then when the whole thing goes out of
[1:10:37] rhythm that's right God's word is a
[1:10:40] great and brother Brandon says God's
[1:10:42] word is a great sympathy
[1:10:43] a symphony rather he keeps interchanging
[1:10:46] it we've preached on that before it's
[1:10:48] the Holy Spirit using both words on
[1:10:50] purpose
[1:10:51] and he says You must begin like he did
[1:10:54] in the music you must begin with him
[1:10:58] notice get in the rhythm of it
[1:11:02] see it's a holy ghost rhythm
[1:11:06] that makes you love God and keep his
[1:11:09] word and your whole life is a life of
[1:11:12] Christianity your whole life is like
[1:11:15] Jesus your attitudes are like Jesus
[1:11:19] you're you're playing the sheet music
[1:11:22] you're in harmony with him see
[1:11:27] you say well I joined church that's not
[1:11:29] the Rhythm I did so that's not the
[1:11:32] Rhythm I went up to the Altar and I said
[1:11:34] I believe Jesus is the son of God Satan
[1:11:37] does the same thing that's not the
[1:11:39] Rhythm see you're out of Swing
[1:11:41] what happened maybe some director told
[1:11:44] you shake hands and put your name on the
[1:11:45] book join our club or our organization
[1:11:47] you're all out of Swing
[1:11:50] come on man you need to get with the
[1:11:52] swing
[1:11:53] you're you're out of swing with the word
[1:11:55] of God so so you know then then there
[1:11:57] was the fact that that the false Church
[1:12:00] wasn't marching to the beat of the
[1:12:02] Gospel they were dancing to Modern
[1:12:04] worldly music see
[1:12:06] and this all began affecting the
[1:12:10] marching order of the true church which
[1:12:13] was paying too much attention to it you
[1:12:15] remember when we talked about even John
[1:12:17] there in the Book of Revelation and when
[1:12:19] he saw the Beast system and the
[1:12:21] and he said I admired her it had my I
[1:12:25] marveled greatly and the angel was
[1:12:27] standing there's a John are you
[1:12:29] marveling that God sent a prophet he had
[1:12:32] a prophetic tour guide who said I will
[1:12:35] show you the revelation of her that she
[1:12:38] hates Christ
[1:12:40] don't don't Marvel after her don't don't
[1:12:43] get transfixed with this world this
[1:12:46] world's going to Ash and send her we got
[1:12:48] another world coming
[1:12:51] see
[1:12:53] so this began affecting their marching
[1:12:55] order
[1:12:56] they they they were getting out of step
[1:12:59] with the original sheet music the true
[1:13:01] church
[1:13:04] say wow you know I've heard preachers
[1:13:06] say good grief if you're if you're
[1:13:09] preaching clothesline Ministry if you're
[1:13:11] preaching clothesline sermons about how
[1:13:13] we should live and talk and dress and
[1:13:15] everything you're not preaching to the
[1:13:16] mature bride
[1:13:18] I beg your pardon
[1:13:20] that's that's nonsense that's just
[1:13:22] that's probably a preacher that likes it
[1:13:24] like that so he can live however he
[1:13:26] wants to live
[1:13:27] I'm here to tell you something friends
[1:13:28] we will never stop preaching
[1:13:30] old-fashioned holiness
[1:13:33] some of the most profound mystery
[1:13:36] preaching comes across this Pulpit but
[1:13:38] we also have a gear that says we need to
[1:13:40] walk right and live right and look right
[1:13:44] and act right
[1:13:46] see
[1:13:48] so this was the true church that brother
[1:13:51] Branham saw getting out of Step this was
[1:13:53] true believers so I'm not preaching to
[1:13:55] the world this is this whole series is
[1:13:57] to True Believers you you must not get
[1:14:00] out of Step watching that other system
[1:14:03] I want to say that I feel like I want to
[1:14:05] say it five times you must not get out
[1:14:09] of Step as a Believer patterning after
[1:14:12] the false impersonation of Christianity
[1:14:18] say well but I I'm not doing that then
[1:14:20] why then why are then why do I see
[1:14:23] certain people dressing the way they do
[1:14:25] acting the way they do going where they
[1:14:27] shouldn't go doing what they shouldn't
[1:14:29] do then why do I see that if it's not
[1:14:32] affecting you I'm not saying you're not
[1:14:33] a believer I'm not saying you're not a
[1:14:34] child of God I'm saying you've been
[1:14:36] mesmerized by the Antichrist
[1:14:41] see a great tool that Satan uses in the
[1:14:43] modern day is to present himself as a
[1:14:45] modern Christian preacher that's a great
[1:14:47] tool in his hand who teaches and sets
[1:14:50] examples that that you and you know and
[1:14:52] sets the example that that you can
[1:14:55] modernize the word and water it down
[1:14:57] make it more tolerable
[1:15:00] you know make it more
[1:15:02] of a tolerable teaching make it easier
[1:15:05] to live you know because it allows for a
[1:15:09] compromising approach towards biblical
[1:15:12] Christianity
[1:15:18] that and I I want to come to one more
[1:15:20] point because I'm determined to stop at
[1:15:22] 8 30. I've been going too long on
[1:15:23] Wednesdays but I'm I want to get to this
[1:15:25] one
[1:15:28] that old-fashioned standards
[1:15:32] and morals
[1:15:34] and holiness
[1:15:36] you know the
[1:15:37] the the false Church basically has the
[1:15:41] position
[1:15:42] and you can see it by the way they live
[1:15:44] I can look right at it
[1:15:46] and I know that that that the
[1:15:48] old-fashioned uh old-fashioned standards
[1:15:51] of morals and Holiness are not observed
[1:15:54] and as far as they're concerned they
[1:15:55] don't need to be observed
[1:15:58] because their belief is God is a god of
[1:16:00] love and he loves you just as he as you
[1:16:04] are and he he doesn't mind if you stay
[1:16:07] just as you are well that's a false
[1:16:09] Doctrine
[1:16:10] God does love no matter where he finds
[1:16:13] you he loves you but he he he doesn't
[1:16:15] save you to leave you where you are he
[1:16:17] saves you to change everything about you
[1:16:20] if you if you didn't if you didn't need
[1:16:22] changing you wouldn't need saving
[1:16:25] see
[1:16:26] so
[1:16:28] can I take up for the old-fashioned
[1:16:30] gospel just for a minute
[1:16:33] is that okay
[1:16:34] I just want to take up for the
[1:16:36] old-fashioned
[1:16:37] gospel
[1:16:39] with my last few minutes you know we
[1:16:41] teach
[1:16:42] uh that godliness and morals and
[1:16:46] holiness
[1:16:47] are part of the love of God
[1:16:51] see I don't I don't say God just is God
[1:16:54] just has so much love he doesn't care I
[1:16:56] don't really need to change because he's
[1:16:57] a god of love but what what the real
[1:17:00] true church teaches is that godliness
[1:17:03] and morals and Holiness are actually
[1:17:07] part of the love of God
[1:17:09] because he loves you too much to leave
[1:17:12] you in ungodliness
[1:17:15] and amoral he loves you too much to do
[1:17:18] that see
[1:17:20] so the teaching of Godly morals and
[1:17:22] standards
[1:17:24] being encapsulated uh within God's love
[1:17:28] I want to say this to you tonight that
[1:17:30] is not a new revelation
[1:17:34] that's not just some end time Revelation
[1:17:36] concocted by a Kentucky hillbilly
[1:17:40] I want to say it again the teaching of
[1:17:42] Godly morals and standards being
[1:17:44] encapsulated within God's love is not a
[1:17:47] new revelation in fact is it's not
[1:17:49] something that came to the earth and the
[1:17:52] time of the Gospels it did not even in
[1:17:54] the days of Jesus when he went about
[1:17:56] doing good that that Godly morals and
[1:18:01] Holiness uh Holiness standards are that
[1:18:06] they are embedded in the love of God is
[1:18:09] actually part of an eternal teaching
[1:18:14] so the Eternal teaching of standards and
[1:18:18] Holiness I'm just trying to really I'm
[1:18:20] just rephrasing it because I really want
[1:18:22] this to stick this is like my whole
[1:18:25] sermon tonight is almost based on this
[1:18:28] statement
[1:18:30] that the Eternal teaching of of the
[1:18:34] standards of Holiness within God's love
[1:18:38] is actually found in the Eden story
[1:18:43] going all the way back to Genesis so if
[1:18:47] you if you call me old-fashioned you
[1:18:50] have no idea
[1:18:54] if you call me old-fashioned you have no
[1:18:57] idea
[1:18:57] this thing goes all the way back to the
[1:19:00] Eden story in Genesis see
[1:19:03] so holiness morality and living
[1:19:06] separated lives unto God
[1:19:09] why
[1:19:11] it says it's a teaching As Old As It
[1:19:14] Gets
[1:19:16] to let people say what they want but I'm
[1:19:19] believing the the the teaching that's as
[1:19:21] old as it gets search the record go all
[1:19:25] the way back to page one
[1:19:27] and I'm standing and it's all through
[1:19:29] the Bible
[1:19:30] see
[1:19:32] so so call me old-fashioned thank you
[1:19:37] it's a great compliment it warms my
[1:19:39] heart
[1:19:40] if that's what you see me as oh I I mean
[1:19:44] that if that's what you notice about me
[1:19:46] then praise God I must be doing
[1:19:47] something right
[1:19:50] G-Man verse 16 again because here's the
[1:19:52] breakdown I want to do on the 16th verse
[1:19:55] nevertheless
[1:19:57] wherein to we have already attained let
[1:20:01] us walk by the same rule let us mind the
[1:20:04] same thing uh in other words we must
[1:20:08] hold on to the progress we have already
[1:20:11] made
[1:20:13] so Paul is just eliminating that you
[1:20:17] that you kind of get a hole in his
[1:20:19] vacation
[1:20:21] that you only have to be holy at church
[1:20:23] time and in the week you can kind of do
[1:20:25] whatever you want
[1:20:26] Holiness is a way of life it's a
[1:20:29] lifestyle it's not a diet it's a
[1:20:31] lifestyle
[1:20:32] morals and high value and Faith these
[1:20:35] kinds of things are part of the kingdom
[1:20:37] of God so so a breakdown you know now
[1:20:40] now a breakdown and and I want to say
[1:20:42] that this is not just me playing on
[1:20:45] words
[1:20:46] what I'm about to say is not just a word
[1:20:49] play all right
[1:20:51] consider the prophetic Bible reference
[1:20:56] to the terms
[1:20:58] former and latter rain
[1:21:00] all right
[1:21:02] so
[1:21:03] the former latter rain
[1:21:06] you know we properly assign
[1:21:09] descriptive terms such as the former
[1:21:13] rain
[1:21:14] and the latter rain and when we're
[1:21:17] describing this prophecy which the
[1:21:19] former latter rain is a prophecy
[1:21:20] concerning the movement of God upon his
[1:21:23] family across time
[1:21:25] all right it's a movement of God upon
[1:21:28] his family across time a former reign of
[1:21:30] Latter rain all right so so we so then
[1:21:33] we properly assign descriptive terms
[1:21:36] such as the former and the latter you
[1:21:40] know where it's it's it's actually
[1:21:42] common in human language for the very
[1:21:44] purpose of context all right so when we
[1:21:47] describe things that are our former then
[1:21:51] what we're meaning is is something older
[1:21:53] or in the past
[1:21:55] all right
[1:21:56] and and things that are latter to mean
[1:21:59] things that are newer or more recent
[1:22:03] and that's just for the purposes of
[1:22:05] context we pick up our Bible and we say
[1:22:07] we have an Old Testament and we
[1:22:10] differentiate the Old Testament from the
[1:22:13] New Testament to differentiate between
[1:22:15] the writings again over time
[1:22:19] all right
[1:22:21] but more perfectly speaking
[1:22:24] more perfectly speaking God's word can
[1:22:27] never actually be
[1:22:29] old-fashioned because God's word is
[1:22:33] eternal
[1:22:36] you get me see as Eternal it actually
[1:22:40] can never be old
[1:22:45] that's why brother Brandon would say
[1:22:47] every thought God has ever had he has
[1:22:50] always had
[1:22:52] he can never have a new thought because
[1:22:55] every thought he has he has always had
[1:22:58] all right
[1:22:59] so I'm trying not to blow fuses tonight
[1:23:01] I'm just trying to keep this this simple
[1:23:04] so the word of God is eternal it can
[1:23:06] never be old
[1:23:08] so it it can never be owed all it can be
[1:23:13] is original or not original
[1:23:18] you got me so this is exactly why the
[1:23:21] spirit of God never anointed his Elijah
[1:23:24] prophet of of of this day to to to
[1:23:27] preach a sermon the spoken word is the
[1:23:30] old seed he told him preach the spoken
[1:23:33] word is the Original Seed
[1:23:37] not the old seed see there's nothing old
[1:23:41] or old-fashioned about the word of God
[1:23:45] because it's the same yesterday in the
[1:23:49] past as it is today in the present and
[1:23:52] it will remain unchanged in the future
[1:23:55] for as many tomorrows as there will ever
[1:23:58] be and when all tomorrows are in the
[1:24:01] past that's a twister when all tomorrows
[1:24:04] are in the past the word will still be
[1:24:07] being lived out
[1:24:10] yeah when the books are closed for the
[1:24:12] last time the word will still be being
[1:24:16] lived out
[1:24:18] it's an eternal word it's not
[1:24:20] old-fashioned it's not a new gospel it's
[1:24:24] the original word
[1:24:27] The Original Seed
[1:24:29] see
[1:24:32] God's word with all of its principles
[1:24:36] will still remain they will still be
[1:24:40] true they will still be relevant they
[1:24:44] will still be enforced even when the
[1:24:47] books are closed for the last time
[1:24:52] his word will be believed throughout
[1:24:55] eternity
[1:24:57] so
[1:24:59] so brother Jason
[1:25:01] how did you end up going down that
[1:25:02] rabbit path
[1:25:04] because I started out by
[1:25:08] showing you that the teaching of Godly
[1:25:11] morals
[1:25:12] are encapsulated within the in the love
[1:25:15] of God and that's not a new revelation
[1:25:21] so the message of the hour is not
[1:25:24] something new it's just a restoration of
[1:25:27] the original
[1:25:29] everything we believe in Holiness that
[1:25:31] were given to us by Elijah the early
[1:25:34] church believed
[1:25:35] and and that that sent them and they
[1:25:39] became part of the first resurrection
[1:25:40] then you'll become part of the first
[1:25:42] resurrection scene
[1:25:43] and so that Godly morals and Holiness
[1:25:48] are embedded in the love of God is is
[1:25:50] literally part of the Eternal teaching
[1:25:52] that goes all the way back as I said
[1:25:54] into Genesis see now I've got to make
[1:25:58] this I got to close this this thought
[1:26:00] out I got two points to make
[1:26:02] so firstly
[1:26:05] this what I just broke down for you
[1:26:09] literally flies in the face of the
[1:26:11] modern interpretation of God's love
[1:26:14] because the modern interpretation of
[1:26:17] God's love separates out morals and
[1:26:20] Holiness and godliness rather than
[1:26:23] having that embedded within the love of
[1:26:25] God amen so first of all it flies right
[1:26:28] in the face of the modern interpretation
[1:26:30] it brings the true word of God literally
[1:26:33] into direct conflict with the message of
[1:26:37] the modern Church uh about God so loving
[1:26:41] the world you you're you're in a
[1:26:42] complete Log Jam the the the modern
[1:26:45] Church of today cannot really preach
[1:26:48] correctly about the love of God
[1:26:52] because their position that they desire
[1:26:54] to hold can't fit in the love of God see
[1:26:59] see so so it so it brings the true word
[1:27:02] indirect and a direct conflict not only
[1:27:04] uh and it's not only in his teaching but
[1:27:07] in its practices and in its Lifestyles
[1:27:09] secondly
[1:27:11] the word of God being eternal
[1:27:16] is it
[1:27:20] the word of God being eternal
[1:27:25] where there really is no old or new it's
[1:27:28] just original or not
[1:27:31] the word of God being eternal
[1:27:34] invalidates any idea
[1:27:39] that the teachings of Elijah the prophet
[1:27:42] in our day
[1:27:44] and the example he lived and the plain
[1:27:48] instructions he gave for how we should
[1:27:52] live
[1:27:53] they are just as valid in 2023 as they
[1:27:58] were in 1965.
[1:28:04] the very fact that the word of God is
[1:28:08] eternal invalidates any other notion
[1:28:12] whatever he said however he lived
[1:28:15] however he'd been plain in plain
[1:28:18] Kentucky broken English
[1:28:21] so that you didn't even have to go get a
[1:28:23] dictionary you can just follow right
[1:28:24] along because we're simple people
[1:28:26] and he told us things we shouldn't do in
[1:28:29] ways we shouldn't dress in places we
[1:28:31] shouldn't go and it's so clear and it's
[1:28:33] so plain I'm not saying you have to like
[1:28:35] cherry pie better than Apple Pie I'm not
[1:28:37] saying you're you're 22 rifle has to be
[1:28:40] a Winchester it doesn't
[1:28:41] okay
[1:28:43] all right you don't have to drive a Ford
[1:28:51] but I'll tell you something friends when
[1:28:52] he went down the line of correct decency
[1:28:54] and morality
[1:28:55] how we should conduct ourselves the
[1:28:58] things that we should and shouldn't
[1:29:00] participate in all the way down to how
[1:29:04] we dress and how we act whether that's
[1:29:06] in church or whether that's in public or
[1:29:09] even he gave us instructions how to not
[1:29:11] act in our home
[1:29:13] even in the privacy of our own homes and
[1:29:16] I'm going to tell you something friends
[1:29:17] those teachings those teachings that God
[1:29:21] sent us through that same messenger that
[1:29:24] told John don't admire her
[1:29:27] those teachings were certified you say
[1:29:30] well they were his opinion his opinions
[1:29:33] were certified by the angel of the Lord
[1:29:36] who fellowshipped with him all the time
[1:29:42] I want to say that again
[1:29:44] there's things where even brother
[1:29:45] Branham like Paul Paul would say no I
[1:29:48] don't I don't I'm not saying Christ you
[1:29:51] know told me this I don't have a
[1:29:53] scripture this is what Paul would say
[1:29:54] said but I think I have the mind of
[1:29:56] Christ I you know this is me not the
[1:29:58] Lord and Paul gave his advice do you
[1:30:00] think you shouldn't follow that
[1:30:02] you think this because Paul said not me
[1:30:05] it's just me not the Lord you think he
[1:30:07] said oh well good I I can scratch that
[1:30:09] one out you better not
[1:30:11] you do so to your own peril I'm here to
[1:30:14] tell you something friends if you
[1:30:16] disregard the direct teachings that are
[1:30:19] on the tape and even the opinions of
[1:30:20] William Brandon for how he lived and how
[1:30:22] he told you and I to live you do that
[1:30:25] and you'll do it to your own Peril
[1:30:26] because I have not shunned to declare
[1:30:29] unto you the whole gospel of Christ
[1:30:32] Hallelujah friends I am not shunned to
[1:30:35] declare unto you the whole counsel of
[1:30:38] God
[1:30:39] Hallelujah and God certified that
[1:30:43] message and that messenger by and
[1:30:46] presence of the Angel of the Lord and
[1:30:49] we're not talking about a Gabriel or or
[1:30:51] a Michael or wormwood we're talking
[1:30:53] about none other than the Lord Jesus
[1:30:56] Christ the same one that Moses followed
[1:30:58] the same one that was a cloud by Tay and
[1:31:01] a fire by Night the same one that came
[1:31:04] down and licked up Elijah's offering
[1:31:06] that same angel of God Walk daily with
[1:31:10] William Branham and certified his
[1:31:13] doctrines teachings and opinions and
[1:31:15] they're good enough for me
