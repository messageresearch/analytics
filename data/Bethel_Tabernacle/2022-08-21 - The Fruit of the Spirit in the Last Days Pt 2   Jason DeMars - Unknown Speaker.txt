========================================

gracious heavenly father we come before you lord and we ask that your presence would be with us lord that you'd come and speak to our hearts lord and deal with us on the basis of your word lord guide and direct our thoughts lord may your anointing be upon each one lord the speaker and the hearer lord may your name be lifted up and glorified in all things we ask these things in jesus christ's name amen so we're going to continue on part two from the fruit of the spirit in the last days and we're going to get this turned on and i think we're gonna go back to the beginning i uh i covered just a few screens last time and did it very slowly so i'm gonna speed up a little bit this time by god's grace so ephesians 4 13 till we all come in the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the son of god unto a perfect man unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of christ amen may the lord have the blessing to the reading of his word he can be seated amen so we have a promise that the church is going to come to this place so there's a per there's there's a purpose for the church beyond um merely the great commission so though that's uh integral part of it but it's something that's even goes beyond that and that that's that god is redeeming right that's that's what he that's that's the whole purpose from the beginning soon from his plan from the beginning was to reveal himself as a redeemer a savior and a healer so adam fell so god is going to right this wrong he's going to he's going to solve this problem and he he does that by fixing what was broken right men and women made in the image and likeness of god is what's broken and so god is going to bring restoration to that ultimately we know that's our new body that's immortality but we also understand that there's a process that we have to go through now number one it's the new birth by the baptism of the holy spirit so new birth and the baptism holy spirit are the same one and the same when you're born again you're baptized with the spirit you're circumcised in your heart you're regenerated all these different terms that the apostles use to describe this event that you're becoming a new creation in christ but god's purpose isn't just to leave you there he doesn't say okay i've called you now just enjoy your life and do whatever you please no he says i've i've called you for a purpose there's something i want to do inside of you i want to bring you to the bible we'll call it perfection or if we look at the word more closely it's speaking of maturity it's speaking of completion so there's a there's a process that god is working within us to bring to completion but we understand looking at the the whole realm of the ages that completion can only come by the revealing of the word and it can't come by a partial word it can't come by a denominational word because why they limit god they limit god's capabilities they limit what god is doing they say this is it no further and so each time a denomination raises up that's what they do and then they organize and they make a battle actually against god saying sorry you're not welcome here you're not welcome to reveal yourself to us we have what we have and we want nothing else and so god says fine i'll keep keep moving on keep moving on and so he keeps moving on keeps raising up more but that's what the reformation came for that's what luther was sent for wesley calvin zwingli all the different reformers were sent for a purpose to restore part of the word but it has to come to a place where the full word is completely restored because there's a there's a maturity paul says to the hebrews you should be teachers by now i want to teach you about melchizedek but now you're dull of hearing and you need to have have milk and be reminded again of the first principles but we'll go on to perfection if god permit well god didn't do it in that age why because as soon as the apostles passed away then the church started on a decline started going against the word that's why the reformation came then it's going on an incline inclined to what back to the fully restored word everything that paul preached and so everything that paul preached there was a purpose in that and it was to bring a people to maturity it was to bring a people to the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the son of god unto a perfect man unto a a complete or another way that you could bring that word perfect man is a mature manhood so that's god's purpose for the church is we're to come to a mature manhood that's why the word is restored to us is to prepare us for a rapture this preparation and growth into maturity is why we're here and that's why i say this fruit of the spirit in the last days there's fruit of the spirit in every age when the holy spirit comes within you it molds you and shapes you into christ but if it's only a part of the word what does it shape you into it can only shape you into a portion of the word in in today today's dna's days we have the perfect brother branham says we have the perfect interpretation of the word with divine vindication uh that when that which is perfect is come the bible speaks about then we then we see dimly but then then we'll know him face to face we'll see clearly and so that's the hour we're living in where he's revealed to us face to face the perfect is come that which is fully mature so it's a fully mature age a fully mature word produces a fully matured people and so that's we're to have a fully matured fruit of the spirit in this day not not a partial not just a portion but a full growth in the character and likeness of jesus christ amen all right anointed ones at the end times brother branham says to see the fruit of the spirit in the last days and the bride tree ripening in the top of the time amen are we ripening we're in the age of ripening that's what god is doing that fruit of the spirit in the last days again there's fruit of the spirit in every age but there's a ripening that's supposed to take place what is ripening it's a maturing really when you look at ripening what is it doing it's getting it ready to be eaten when it's not ripe it still has certain chemicals and different things in it that's trying to prevent you from eating it's still too green you can't you don't want to harvest it then now they do they harvest it and they put it in some building but we're going to do it we're going to see it god's way we're going to be on the vine ripening then he harvests us and so we're what is the prophet sweetening up in the spirit is one way he puts it that's exactly what happens when the when when the fruit ripens so we're supposed we're supposed to see all the things that paul wrote about we're supposed to see it in its mature form today in a body of people galatians 5 6 screens and it was 10 minutes so i guess i'm not moving very fast we'll do our best but we'll let the holy spirit direct us amen galatians 5 6 this i say then walk in the spirit and you shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh so paul is trying to get the galatians away from looking at outward obedience for their leadership and salvation outward obedience is what what the galatians were being preached at they received the gospel they received the holy spirit and then false teachers came behind them and said you ha in order to in order to get what you already have you've got to come and be circumcised and follow the law you've got to come and be part of the mosaic covenant in order to get the new covenant and paul's saying wait a minute what's what's happening here you've already got it somebody's coming trying to put you in under a yoke of bondage and so he's trying to explain and rightly divide the law and grace if you walk in the spirit you will not fulfill the lust of the flesh so if you're walking after the nature of the spirit you'll not perform or execute the works of the flesh and is your life worthy of the gospel brother branham says when this takes place the thing you'll do then you'll find out that the spirit comes that comes in you from the new birth you will believe and do everything that god says in his word is for you to do notice notice again what he says when that spirit comes in you from the new birth then you will believe and do everything that god says in his word for you to do so it's that nature change it's that spiritual transformation that takes place on the inside of the inside then you do not the other way around not you do and and then and then you get the spirit no get the spirit and then god molds you into obedience to the word and everything that the bible quotes for you to do you'll punctuate it with an amen and you'll not stop day and night until you receive it that's right that's right and in all this time you'll certainly above everything bear the fruit of the spirit amen galatians 5 17 for the flesh lusts against the spirit and the spirit against the flesh and these are contrary the one to the other so that you cannot do the things you would so the word lusteth there that means to set the heart upon so the flesh sets the heart against the spirit in other words the flesh is trying to control the control tower right the out that's how satan works from the from the outside in so from the outside the flesh the devil is kind of trying to control the heart but the spirit also sets sets the heart against the flesh so in other words there's there's a battle for control that's taking place and it says these are contrary the one to the other so that you cannot do the things that you would so when you receive the holy ghost a battle takes place on the inside and there's and we we have to engage in this fight the sinful nature that we have in our flesh wants to take control it's it's going to push to take control okay but but the holy spirit inside is also pushing to take control and what it what is the difference it's a matter of what we surrender to or as brother branham says which dog you feed the most you know the story of the black dog and the white dog and so our war begins and as a result we we struggle and we battle to manifest the reality of the spirit of the living god inside of us that's our that's what our ultimate goal is remember the verse before us if you walk in the spirit you won't fulfill the lusts of the flesh and so what's the key what's the key in this battle walk in the spirit verse 18 but if you be led of the spirit you are not under the law so that that's the necessity that's what paul is trying to point these people to in galatia and point us to is that we need to be led by the spirit if we're led by the spirit then we're not subject the law and we're not under the law we don't need to we don't need to take the ten commandments and lay them out in front of us and make sure we're obeying them because the holy spirit inside of us is leading us to fulfill that law our flesh can't keep the ten commandments that's proven out genesis to revelation our flesh walks in disobedience we do good one day we do bad the next day we can never maintain by our flesh obedience to the word the law is a school master to lead us to christ in other words the law is teaching us you cannot save yourself you cannot overcome the sinful nature you need christ the law shows us that we're sinners and the law puts us in bondage it puts us in bondage to punishment john 16 13 says how be it when he the spirit of truth is come he will guide you into all truth for he shall not speak of himself but whatsoever he shall hear that shall he speak and he will show you things to come so the guide is the opposite side of the one being led so the holy spirit is the guide and we are the ones that need to be led by him in all things that's that's if you're not getting it yet that's the key that's the key is to being being led by and walking in the spirit how what does that mean what does that look like well paul speaks about that what it looks like but the reality is i think each one of us understands it's your it's your connection with him it's your relationship with him that's that's the purpose of the gospel is to bring a relationship between you and god he speaks to you he teaches you he convicts you and he guides you in all things galatians 5 19 now the works of the flesh are manifest which are these adultery fornication uncleanness lasciviousness idolatry witchcraft hatred variants emulations wrath strife seditions heresies envyings murders drunkenness revelings and such like of the which i tell you before as i have told you in time past that they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of god this is what the flesh does paul gives us a list this is what the flesh does this is what the flesh produces and he says it's the works of the flesh it's the works that the flesh performs flesh doesn't obey the it doesn't obey the law it doesn't obey the word it's completely sold out under sin the flesh is under bondage to sin and is totally incapable of obedience to god we have to get that part of out of our mind that somehow it's we're going to get our kids to be real good and they're going to be totally obedient to the word hey kids are messed up that's why that's why we have youth meetings that's that's why we're working with the youth constantly is because they're messed up why are they messed up they're born that way they're born with a sinful nature and they make mistakes and they do stupid stuff and it's our jobs as fathers and as mothers to teach them to guide them but the reality is kids make mistakes because they're because they're dominated by the flesh and so by the word we keep them under under the atmosphere that they need to be until they get born again but the fact is they make mistakes and that's okay we're trying to guide them we're trying to teach them we're trying to help them to grow but that flesh is under bondage and it's not capable of obedience verse 22 but the fruit of the spirit is love joy peace long suffering gentleness goodness faith meekness temperance against such there is no law so that's the ninefold fruit of the spirit the flesh produces the negative the holy spirit in us produces the positive life of god this is the life of god so if you're talking about the fruit of the spirit it's talking about what's being produced the end product so the spirit we have to receive the spirit to do it a person can mimic a person can be in the right atmosphere and sort of produce these things you see brother brother branham talks about this with the pharisees interaction with jesus and the pharisee but jesus is telling them calling them vipers and uh all kinds of names we would say calling them a devil and it's it's the priest saying who's the one that was there when you were sick who was the one that was there there and and lend you that money when you needed it who was the one that took care took care of you and brother branham says the fruit they could outdo jesus in the fruit of the spirit that's not that's not the fruit of the spirit it's receiving the word in other words in other words what what is what is that mean so jesus didn't have the fruit of the spirit is that what brother branham's saying obviously not what what is it is that the fruit of the spirit is is not what we see externally and figure out exactly what it is when jesus was braiding ropes and getting ready to whip the people he wasn't going contrary to the fruit of the spirit he was doing what the spirit of the lord was leading him to do was showing him to do these these things are important to understand in their balance but the holy spirit this is what it produces in our life love joy peace these are these are all some of them are emotions some of them are attributes of character but when you have these things manifested in your life life against such there is no law god has not merely called us to avoid the works of darkness or to speak against the works of works of darkness yes he's called us to avoid them and he's called us to speak against them but what he's really called us to is to manifest his nature that's first and foremost when we manifest his nature then the darkness has to flee it's the light that pushes back the darkness and so when when when you're manifesting this kind of life you you can't you can't hold on to darkness you you can't grip darkness you can't live in darkness you're you're actually destroying it by the life that you're living not necessarily by the words that you're speaking but the kind of atmosphere that's created around you i mean think about these nine-fold fruit of the spirit what an atmosphere is created when these things are manifested it's it's it's incredible what is it it's god it's the nature of god brother branham says this in the marriage of the lamb the holy ghost is meekness joy peace long suffering goodness gentleness patience faith the holy ghost that's the fruit of the spirit that the holy spirit bears in the church of the living god sweetness and humbleness humility love one another love for one love one for another long suffering if a brother has gone wrong don't just beat him or something another go after him and see if you can get him back don't wait for the preacher do it you do it somebody else preacher can't do it all neither can the deacons everybody is a member of this body of christ should go after one another and if we got the spirit of christ in us he taught the great parable they left the 90 and 9 and went after that one that's what we're supposed to do but we say oh let them go we never should do that we should be gentle forgiving long-suffering that's the fruit of the spirit amen amen i love that brother branham doesn't put that off on merely your pastor he doesn't put that only on the preacher but he puts that if you have the nature of christ your heart is going to be going after the 90 and 9. amen this is not a compromising spirit it's it's it's a spirit in you that says that brother or sister has gone wrong they've gone the wrong direction they're doing wrong they're living wrong but my heart in love doesn't just say oh look at that terrible guy over there isn't he bad let's just avoid them no it says oh my what's happening how can we help how can how can we help restore them how can we be a blessing to them how can we build them up that's the spirit of christ galatians 5 24 and they that are christ's have crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts amen if we live in the spirit let us also walk in the spirit if we live in the spirit let us walk in the spirit it's not we're not under a yoke of bondage if the message is a yoke of bondage to you and it's a bunch of rule rules and do's and don'ts then you haven't got the spirit of christ you haven't been changed or you've been taught wrong you've been taught wrong you've been approached wrong this message is not a list of rules and do's and don'ts the message is a relationship with christ transforming power and yes there is a standard but the holy spirit is the one that's working in you to give you a delight to obey the word amen when i threw away my shorts after i got after i came to the message went through my shorts no one was forcing me to i wasn't unhappy about it i was happy i was thankful i was thankful for the correction why i wanted to go there i wanted a way to go the way the lord wanted me to go that's just a small thing that's me and that's me in christ and that's you in christ in your obedience you know we we we're living in an hour that's lukewarm and we're living in under a spirit of laodicea that pushes us towards lukewarmness and you know it's it's not that there's not warmth there lukewarm is lukewarm it's not it's not freezing cold it's not i hate god i want nothing to do with him it's like well i i love god and i love my other stuff too lord help us to be delivered from this spirit of of compromise and and lust that's on this world the lust for the things of the world in um got a lengthy quote from turn on the light brother branham says think the people can go right on preaching the ecumen ecumenical council can join up with the catholic church just as they promise to do all organizations can come on but the mark of the beast is already there they take it in that see and they say oh hallelujah bless god there was so many got saved last night they did they danced in the spirit they spoke in tugs that don't mean one thing see oh they're meek and gentle and humble yes sir they got the fruit of the spirit that's no sign not a bit let me give you the fruit of the spirit oh okay between jesus and the pharisees see which one had the fruit of the spirit what if i stood as i started to say a while ago against christ now for a minute god forgive me for even saying it see but just to show you something what if i come to you and say say your congregation who's your friend who shows you who shows the fruit of the spirit your kind old priest who comes to you in the hospital when you're sick your gentle old priest that's right who is it always loans you some money when you're up against it in a tight place you members of his congregation don't you go to your kind of priest and he loans you money see who is that that's always loving and kind and showing the fruit of the spirit your kind old priest who has that studied for years and years in the synagogues down there where his great great great great great great grandfather come from all the way down who is it that studied and got worked hard and got doctors degrees and phds and lld's to know his this word and stand here and deliver it to you every sunday morning in his congregation you're kind of priests who is this renegade called jesus what school did he come from what school is he out of where is his fellowship card what organization does he belong to what does he do when you all have a family argument who comes to you your kind old priest all you have and you have an argument against this neighbor over here and an argument against and and your kind old priest comes and makes makes you up said you all are children of god you shouldn't do that what's this jesus of nathan it does tear tears the thing up what does he do lambast your organization what does he do called your plot priest a blind leader of the blind he called him a snake in the grass he took the sacrifice that god ordained and cooked the tables over and throwed the money out and looked upon them with anger do you ever see your priest look like that now where is the fruit of the spirit not by speaking in tongues not by dancing in the spirit not by joining church not by fruit of the spirit christian science can outsmother any of you on that see and deny even jesus christ was divine not that but it's the word living there it is if they'd have only looked he was messiah he was the living word made manifest and a man that's got the spirit of god in him or a woman lives that word lives right out in them that's the heartbeat the predestinated for the word of the lord comes to them and they are the word of the lord word to the people written epistles read of all men is that right could the third pole be on you can't judge by speaking in tongues neither can you judge by the fruit of the spirit but it's a manifestation of the word of god brought to light it's the light that does it the man that walks in that light jesus christ was not founding upon speaking in tongues though he did it he was not the fruit of the spirit though he did it you couldn't judge it but he believed and punctuated it and god lived every word of the promise of that day through him that's the light of the hour that's the evidence when a man tells me that the holy ghost falling in them will deny the word of god being so there's something wrong with it amen there's many things that i could bring out of that and we're really out of time just take one moment in finishing it up is you you can't you can't take this statement where brother banham grabs this and shows it's not the fruit of the spirit because i've seen people in an out of balanced life they take that well it's not the fruit of the spirit see jesus lambasted them so they live a life of lambasting the people everybody that they see everybody that they're around that's not what's being said when when when we're confronted with a situation what is it saying when we're confronted with a situation that's against the word we take a stand it doesn't mean we have to be harsh or hard about it but we take our stand god called jesus to call them vipers and demons i'm not sure if he called you you and i to call everybody vipers and demons maybe a circumstance would arise but that shouldn't be our norm and default it becomes people's norm and default if somebody disagrees with me goes against my church that person is a demon and a viper i think it's a dangerous thing because you don't know that you don't know what's what's happening in the person's life you don't know what god could do down the road so the the purpose is if the lord reveals to you to say that then say it but if you're just saying it because of reasoning and logic leave your reasoning and logic aside love love them be kind to them but take your stand be firm it's scriptural to take your stand it's scriptural to have boundaries it's scriptural to say you can't you can't do that you can't speak that that's wrong that's not right that's loving that's a loving thing to do but in other words it's not what the world thinks the fruit of the spirit is it's not what the word world thinks living the word is it's what the word says and it's his leadership of the holy spirit so that's a terrible place to end i wish i had more time let's stand and and pray and next time i'm here we'll continue heavenly father we thank you so much for your light in this hour lord we know that it's as we see you as your revealed lord in this hour that we're changed and transformed into that same image lord and it's producing the very life of the word within us lord and that's the that's love that's the fruit that's the gifts that's all these things lord you're glorified in your people lord let us get ourselves and our flesh out of the way may we walk in the spirit and be led by the spirit so we wouldn't fulfill the lusts of the flesh and lord our is for more of you lord pour yourself out on us lord more and more may we be filled more and more with the spirit lord in every aspect of our life we ask these things in the name of jesus christ amen god bless you you
