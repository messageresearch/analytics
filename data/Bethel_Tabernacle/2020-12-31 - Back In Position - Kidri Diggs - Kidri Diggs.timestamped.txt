[26:53] all of us with open service on the first
[26:56] sunday of the new year
[26:58] in january now these are uncertain times
[27:02] and
[27:05] strange and unsettling times so we'll
[27:07] just have to keep you
[27:09] updated but i've been trying to do that
[27:11] i've been trying to be very faithful to
[27:13] keep the church informed uh just to let
[27:16] you understand that all the decisions
[27:18] that are made
[27:19] regarding that are made in group with
[27:22] all of the ministry and officers
[27:24] teams i've been in a lot of discussion
[27:27] with them and
[27:28] you know there's a a very very good
[27:32] honest open dialogue as to
[27:34] what we're facing what we should do what
[27:36] should be our response so
[27:38] at this time it's my tentative plan to
[27:41] have the service back for everybody uh
[27:44] come the third of january
[27:48] and i hope we're able to do that i
[27:49] expect that we will
[27:51] um and i hope that that will carry
[27:53] through i will keep you posted
[27:55] so please just keep a track on the
[27:58] church
[27:58] um whatsapp that goes out to the whole
[28:01] assembly
[28:02] that's where i will post anything just a
[28:04] reminder tonight
[28:05] that if you have any prayer requests
[28:07] send them to me personally
[28:09] via whatsapp or sms and i'll get them
[28:11] here on my device
[28:13] amen and um we're happy to have brother
[28:16] diggs you might just let him know we're
[28:18] ready for him brother matthew
[28:19] and um we're happy to have him here
[28:22] tonight this is
[28:23] uh you won't see him again until next
[28:25] year amen so this is
[28:27] uh the last time we'll that uh we're
[28:29] going to give him a chance to come out
[28:31] and
[28:31] beat the devil's brains out amen amen
[28:34] huh
[28:35] i've always referred to brother diggs as
[28:37] the weapon
[28:38] and he's he's the weapon that i bring in
[28:41] here to give the devil a good
[28:43] thumping amen so we appreciate that and
[28:46] i know that he knows it's a compliment
[28:48] amen
[28:49] amen the enemy fears him that's for sure
[28:52] but we love him we love brother diggs
[28:53] here he's been ministering for us
[28:55] he comes once a month we've kind of been
[28:57] doing that since
[28:58] uh probably the last year and a half and
[29:00] we have been
[29:02] the happy beneficiaries of that now
[29:04] tonight we've got him a little bit on a
[29:07] little bit of corral well not a corral
[29:08] he's welcome to
[29:09] preach on whatever's on his heart but
[29:11] we've got him on a little bit of at
[29:12] least
[29:13] short lease time wise because i want to
[29:16] be able to come up behind him
[29:18] before we dismiss when we take up the
[29:20] prayer request and i've got just some
[29:22] other things that i'd like to
[29:24] say that are on my heart i'd like to say
[29:26] to you the whole the whole assembly
[29:28] who are home uh streaming tonight and if
[29:30] they're not catching it live i'm hoping
[29:32] hoping they will catch it then on the
[29:35] archive
[29:36] but just some things that i want to um
[29:39] talk about give you a little bit of an
[29:40] idea
[29:42] about the upcoming year the things
[29:44] that's in my heart and the ministry team
[29:46] and things that we want to do kind of a
[29:49] vision for the year
[29:50] the reason i want to do it tonight is
[29:52] because i don't want to spend any of my
[29:54] precious preaching time on that first
[29:56] sunday doing it
[29:57] so we're going to try to take a little
[29:59] bit so we've asked brother diggs to uh
[30:02] you know hold it back just a little bit
[30:04] tonight and then that'll give me
[30:06] now we want the holy ghost to take his
[30:08] liberty so i know what i said
[30:10] but what i said is subject to change of
[30:12] what he says
[30:13] and so whatever time you leave me i'll
[30:15] just use whatever time that is
[30:18] but brother diggs is a pro and a veteran
[30:20] he knows he understands how that goes
[30:22] but we'll let the holy ghost have
[30:24] liberty tonight we'll definitely
[30:25] take up your prayer requests we want to
[30:27] pray for any of your needs
[30:28] so if you have them feel free to send
[30:30] them in to me
[30:32] and we will catch those at the end want
[30:34] to pray for everything
[30:35] that everybody sends in and then i will
[30:38] take a few minutes at the end
[30:40] and just kind of speak to you a little
[30:42] bit
[30:43] you know kind of a state of the church
[30:45] state of the union thing
[30:47] but i won't take long but just want to
[30:49] deliver my heart
[30:50] on this last service we were supposed to
[30:52] have communion service tonight we had to
[30:55] push that off we'll push it off into
[30:58] into january we will get to that
[31:01] i want to start doing that more often
[31:02] that's one of the things we want to talk
[31:04] about tonight
[31:05] but god bless you we want to invite
[31:06] brother diggs to come now
[31:08] and just take his liberty amen in the
[31:11] lord
[31:11] only believe again sister dead

[31:25] that all things

[32:38] lord jesus father we're here tonight
[32:41] lord and as we often say that we're here
[32:43] on the merits of your grace lord
[32:45] lord knowing that it's nothing we've
[32:47] done but it's all your choosing lord
[32:50] lord before the foundation of the world
[32:52] you saw us here
[32:53] in bethel tabernacle lord you've seen it
[32:56] in different conditions
[32:57] we would be around lord but that doesn't
[32:59] stop the word of god from going forth
[33:02] so lord we pray that tonight lord you
[33:04] have total preeminence
[33:06] lord in me and in both listen in
[33:09] the lord jesus and speaker lord god that
[33:12] this service would

[33:26] protected lord
[33:28] lord it's that blood that keeps your
[33:30] hand of grace in our lives
[33:33] so lord we love you and we appreciate
[33:35] for the sacrifice
[33:36] of your life in the name of jesus christ
[33:38] we pray the church amen
[33:41] amen if you have your bibles amen we
[33:43] appreciate all the songs
[33:44] let's go to um genesis the
[33:47] first chapter genesis chapter 1.
[33:56] blessed be the name of the lord familiar
[33:57] verse of scriptures
[33:59] genesis chapter 1 verse 26.
[34:04] the bible says and god said let us make
[34:07] man
[34:08] in our image after our likeness
[34:11] and let them have dominion over the fish
[34:14] of the sea over the fowl of the air over
[34:17] the cattle
[34:18] over the earth and over every creeping
[34:21] thing
[34:22] that created upon the earth so god
[34:25] created man in his
[34:26] own image in the image of god
[34:30] created he him male and female
[34:34] amen let's go to matthew chapter 27.
[34:40] matthew 27.
[34:54] matthew 27 and verse
[34:58] verse 50.
[35:03] matthew 27 and 50 the bible says
[35:07] jesus when he had cried again with a
[35:09] loud voice yielded
[35:11] up the ghost and behold the veil of the
[35:13] temple was rent
[35:15] and twain from top to bottom
[35:18] and the earth did quake and the rocks
[35:20] rent
[35:21] and the graves were open and many bodies
[35:24] of the saints which slept arose
[35:28] and came out of the graves after his
[35:30] resurrection and went into the holy city
[35:32] and appeared
[35:33] unto many and maybe the lord blessing to
[35:36] the reading of his word
[35:38] amen you have your seats you know
[35:41] tonight by the grace of god
[35:43] real briefly i want to use for a subject
[35:46] back
[35:47] in position amen back in
[35:50] position church i know that we're in a
[35:52] time
[35:53] where everything seems very shaky you
[35:56] know one minute we're in church one
[35:58] minute without a church
[36:00] one minute healings in the land one
[36:02] minute sickness is in hand
[36:03] in the land but one thing i want us to
[36:05] realize
[36:07] that we live and move and have our being
[36:09] in christ
[36:10] you know so although we we operate
[36:13] according to the things of the land
[36:16] that's not our position amen our
[36:18] position
[36:20] is in the revelation of jesus christ you
[36:22] know but i i want to i want to deal with
[36:24] this
[36:26] you know simply for what it is you know
[36:28] the prophet of god he said that
[36:31] we are amateur creators we are uh
[36:34] if you could say it like this we are we
[36:37] are god's

[38:10] the story of
[38:11] david and saul the bible says when david
[38:13] came
[38:14] and he played the instrument and cast
[38:16] out the demons that was in saul's life
[38:19] the bible says and saul was refreshed
[38:23] what was it david was in his position

[38:29] refresh somebody

[38:52] power
[38:52] hallelujah in your position now you look
[38:55] church
[38:56] god made everything else first you know
[38:59] he made the boom
[39:00] the stars you know the heavens he heard
[39:02] and then he came and he started making
[39:04] creation on the natural earth to put it
[39:07] in the earth
[39:07] he made fish and all the animals and all
[39:10] these things
[39:10] and then he made a man holly he made a
[39:13] man last
[39:14] he was the last thing you made but it
[39:17] was the strongest
[39:18] all right it was the best hallelujah
[39:21] why because that was the only thing that
[39:24] could
[39:24] fully resemble god
[39:28] praise the lord you say well lamb
[39:31] is the type of god an eagle is a type of
[39:34] god a lion
[39:35] is a type of god but church what was the
[39:37] first type
[39:40] wow according to the scriptures the
[39:42] first type was a man
[39:44] hallelujah he said i created man in my
[39:47] own image
[39:48] and likeness harlow and he gave that man
[39:51] dominion that was his position
[39:53] his position was to control all right
[39:57] what about your situation are you
[40:00] controlling it
[40:00] or is something else controlling it you
[40:04] hurry up as one of god's many me
[40:07] you have the power to control it there
[40:09] wasn't a situation
[40:10] in the bible that jesus didn't control
[40:14] amen he went to the death of lazarus
[40:18] and controlled it hallelujah
[40:21] oh church there's a place in the
[40:23] scripture where they said
[40:25] they wanted to throw jesus off a cliff
[40:27] hallelujah he controlled that situation
[40:30] why because there was no scripture
[40:32] saying that he was going to die of a
[40:34] cliff
[40:34] holy when you know who you are and
[40:37] you're in your position
[40:38] you can control your what's going on
[40:43] the church look at that man that man in
[40:45] his position
[40:46] the prophet of god saying he could
[40:48] control the trees
[40:50] he tell a tree get up from the east wing
[40:52] and go west
[40:53] hallelujah that's the power he had he
[40:56] had the power
[40:57] of the spoken word why because he was a
[40:59] god
[41:01] now i'm going to say something you know
[41:02] the prophet say when he was talking
[41:04] about
[41:04] man be omnipotent he said i was gonna
[41:06] choke it he said what i'ma say it
[41:08] man was created to be omnipotent
[41:13] that's your position tonight amen
[41:17] that's your position to be all powerful
[41:21] omnipotent that's your position in
[41:24] adam's position
[41:25] everything had to obey him adam was so
[41:29] much like god
[41:30] he went to creation and told creation
[41:33] what it was
[41:36] amen
[41:40] in his position that's right but you
[41:42] look church
[41:44] adam he lost his position
[41:47] he lost the position in the fall
[41:50] he did something god told him not to do
[41:52] he willfully did it
[41:54] he lost his position but he didn't lose
[41:57] hallelujah
[41:58] his true identity
[42:03] think about the church you can lose your
[42:05] position but you'll never lose your true
[42:07] identity
[42:09] see he just had spiritual amnesia he was
[42:12] always a adam hallelujah
[42:15] glory he was always a son he was always
[42:18] a god hallelujah
[42:20] there was just something that took place
[42:22] within his own
[42:23] human spirit see what happens when you
[42:26] live like a human
[42:28] you live with spiritual amnesia amen
[42:32] i don't want to be a human all right i
[42:34] want to be a son of god
[42:38] as a son of god there's a certain thing
[42:40] that comes along with that title
[42:45] and we know in that position when adam
[42:48] lost his position
[42:50] he lost the authority hollywood
[42:53] to believe in what god made him to be
[42:57] now i want you to catch this even though
[43:00] harley
[43:00] he fell in the sin he still was a son
[43:05] even the prophet of god said even in the
[43:07] fallen condition
[43:08] they're still sons and daughters of god
[43:11] because god is the only one that can
[43:12] create
[43:13] hallelujah so in that condition
[43:15] hallelujah
[43:16] adam being out of position he still was
[43:19] what god said he is
[43:23] that's why god had to bring a message in
[43:26] this day
[43:27] hollywood because that was the only
[43:29] thing that could put us back in position
[43:33] hallelujah hungry without this message
[43:36] we will be
[43:36] living a revelation of part
[43:42] knowing from the beginning he said you
[43:45] are in my
[43:46] image and my likeness hallelujah so he
[43:49] had to bring something
[43:50] to restore that image and that likeness
[43:53] he had to do something to put
[43:54] man fully back in position hallelujah
[43:58] now what i love about the story of adam
[44:00] because he was a god
[44:02] hallelujah he walked away with a memory
[44:05] of knowing what it was like to be a god
[44:09] wow holy anybody ever been blessed
[44:13] and you remember what it's like to be
[44:15] blessed
[44:16] if you were ever sick and were healed
[44:18] you got a memory of what it's like
[44:21] to be healed hallelujah see there's
[44:23] something god put in us
[44:25] that we will never forget where we came
[44:27] from
[44:28] that's right amen now you think about
[44:32] adam walking out of that garden
[44:34] he's leaving that garden with a memory
[44:37] of the position he was in yeah
[44:42] think about it today he had to work hard
[44:44] and he had
[44:45] he had to kill the ground and do all
[44:47] these things he was doing all that with
[44:49] a memory of
[44:50] man i used to be a god
[44:53] i used to speak the creation it did
[44:55] whatever whatever whatever i said to
[44:57] her i didn't have to worry about the
[44:59] animals they were my pets
[45:01] the lions was my pets the tiger was my
[45:03] pet hallelujah
[45:05] everything was his pet called in his
[45:07] position he controlled
[45:09] his surroundings and you
[45:12] and your position you have the authority
[45:14] and power
[45:15] to control your surroundings you say

[45:34] to get in my position so the whole world
[45:38] earth and creation can recognize who i
[45:40] am
[45:41] when i get in my position church read
[45:43] your bible
[45:44] when jesus hallelujah in his position as
[45:47] a redeemer when he died
[45:49] the whole world took notice
[45:54] even the unbelievers took notice even
[45:57] the grave
[45:58] death
[46:07] [Music]
[46:10] church the bible says see jesus knew he
[46:13] had to redeem mankind
[46:15] and we're going somewhere we just see
[46:17] this tonight it's like
[46:19] what we grew up on my daughter don't
[46:20] know about us we grew up on pac-man
[46:25] pac-man and pac woman and what they
[46:28] would do
[46:29] they would run from ghosts until they
[46:31] got a power pellet
[46:34] that power pellet meant everything once
[46:36] they get that power pellet
[46:38] the ghost started running why pac-man
[46:41] was impositioned in
[46:43] wow pac woman was in position there
[46:46] and then the ghosts recognized who they
[46:49] were chasing
[46:50] once you get hallelujah that power
[46:52] pellet
[46:53] called the holy ghost the ghost will run
[46:55] from you
[46:58] i heard a brother say one time

[47:02] i'm the nightmare in my dream
[47:06] hallelujah devils don't torment me i'm
[47:08] the nightmare in my
[47:10] dream amen
[47:15] see when you know who you are look it's
[47:18] clear
[47:19] it's clear the prophet of god said jesus
[47:22] was walking in a frail
[47:24] body about 135 pounds but the demons
[47:27] recognized who he was
[47:29] not according to his flesh according to
[47:31] his spirit
[47:32] hallelujah they looked at that little
[47:34] body hallelujah and they said
[47:36] we know who thou art
[47:41] even though he left the throne and came
[47:43] and took on a body of sin
[47:45] he still was god showing us who we
[47:48] are when you know who you are the demons
[47:52] recognize who you are in your position
[47:55] amen oh my
[47:58] but adam lost all that so god said huh
[48:02] i'm not gonna settle for this i'm gonna
[48:04] put man back where they're supposed to
[48:06] be
[48:07] i'm gonna put you i'm gonna put bethel
[48:08] tabernacle where they supposed to be i'm
[48:10] gonna put them back in position
[48:11] hallelujah
[48:12] how did he do it he said i'm gonna give
[48:14] my life hallelujah
[48:16] look he tucked away harlow you took away
[48:19] the
[48:19] sacrifice of bulls and ghosts and he
[48:22] became
[48:22] the supreme sacrifice because he know
[48:26] once you got in position and accepted
[48:29] christ as your
[48:30] as your sacrifice that put you back to
[48:33] genesis 1 26
[48:38] that's why the temple was rent from top
[48:40] to bottom hallelujah
[48:42] and everything took notice that god had
[48:44] redeemed the whole world
[48:49] church you have to realize what god does
[48:52] don't get nervous about the clothes what
[48:54] god does
[48:56] he pushes us back into our position
[48:59] because sometimes we don't even realize
[49:02] what's in us
[49:02] he had to push the prophet into speaking
[49:05] squirrels
[49:07] and he was right in the midst of it
[49:09] hallelujah one
[49:10] two of them he right in the midst of it
[49:12] still doubting
[49:13] and god had to push him some more
[49:18] come on let's put that first quote up so
[49:20] i can get out of the way
[49:22] this isn't a message i know hallelujah
[49:27] he says every christian believer
[49:31] i know i know yeah those are upside down
[49:35] i mean yeah yeah that's it that's it
[49:37] yeah
[49:38] he says every christian believer has to
[49:42] be
[49:42] pushed into those trials look god
[49:46] pushes us into trials think about that
[49:49] so even when i'm going through something
[49:51] god got his hand on me
[49:54] and it may look like it's something
[49:56] crazy it may look like something
[49:57] ridiculous
[49:58] it might even look like i'm saying but
[50:00] the problem god said
[50:01] is god pushing me into a trial
[50:05] what is he doing putting me in position
[50:07] [Applause]
[50:09] oh i feel my helper coming up i'm sorry
[50:12] cameraman
[50:13] 10 people 20 people 100 people hey man
[50:18] listen he says every christian believer
[50:21] do we have christian believers here
[50:22] tonight
[50:23] will you say birthdays my bills behind
[50:25] god's hand is behind you
[50:27] yeah you say oh my family messed up
[50:29] god's hand is pushing you
[50:31] he said oh i'm a little sick in my body
[50:33] god's hand is on your back pushing
[50:36] the devil ain't doing nothing
[50:42] he says every christian believer has to
[50:44] be pushed
[50:46] into those trials every christian listen
[50:48] to the reason why
[50:50] listen he says every christian believer
[50:53] has to be put
[50:54] on the ash heap so that they can come
[50:56] forth
[50:57] with an experience
[51:01] amen that's why tongs is not the
[51:03] evidence experiences the evidence
[51:08] he says pushed on the ash heap
[51:12] so that he can come forth with an
[51:15] experience
[51:16] i know my redeemer liveth hallelujah
[51:19] so you mean god to take us through
[51:21] things just to unveil more of himself in
[51:24] our life
[51:25] earlier so we can know who he is
[51:28] in deeper depths hallelujah and i'll
[51:30] give you a key
[51:32] when you know who he is you definitely
[51:34] know who you are
[51:36] [Applause]
[51:37] amen and when god pushes us
[51:40] pushes us to believe into a trial then
[51:43] we walk out with experience saying
[51:45] i know my regime are living i know my
[51:48] god got my back
[51:49] i know my god on my side i know my god
[51:52] is a healer
[51:53] i know my god is righteous i know my
[51:55] god's deliverer
[51:56] i know my god is faithful
[52:00] that's what the child is all about
[52:02] putting you back in position where you
[52:04] can never doubt god
[52:06] amen luke church before the fall
[52:09] adam didn't have any doubt
[52:12] amen
[52:17] and amen taking a step further even
[52:21] his act doing the fall shows he didn't
[52:24] have no doubt
[52:28] because the bible the prophet said he
[52:30] willfully sinned
[52:33] so he knew he wasn't being deceived
[52:36] he knew the day he partook of he was
[52:39] going to die hallelujah
[52:41] but him being a type of god as a
[52:43] redeemer
[52:44] he injected his seed into his wife so
[52:46] she couldn't die
[52:48] because god couldn't kill himself see
[52:51] in his position he was a redeemer
[52:54] even in his wrong adam was typing out
[52:56] god in his position
[53:04] why because he was created in the image
[53:06] of god
[53:08] all he could do is redeem
[53:11] wow
[53:16] [Music]
[53:17] all you can do is save hallelujah
[53:21] and adam willfully sending save e
[53:26] delivered eve and in the midst of all
[53:29] that
[53:30] and he brought forth life
[53:33] [Music]
[53:34] all in his position my
[53:38] sea church our childhood tribulations
[53:39] are there to bring forth something that
[53:42] says
[53:42] i know my redeemer living your trial is
[53:45] not
[53:46] that you may backslide no no
[53:50] god is not the other confusion he has a
[53:53] purpose in everything he does
[53:55] holly little church it's like a baby
[54:00] you take a baby and as that baby grows
[54:03] and grows and grows
[54:04] i believe my my baby girl kiara started
[54:06] walking at nine months
[54:08] you know so as she grew and ate food and
[54:11] grew
[54:13] she got to a place and y'all had seen
[54:14] babies do this
[54:16] she got to a place where she would crawl
[54:18] and this should use her
[54:20] own strength and pull up on something
[54:22] and just stand there
[54:24] not even knowing she can walk
[54:28] wow the ability was already in her
[54:31] she just had to be coached and pushed
[54:33] into it
[54:34] hallelujah now to push from a parent
[54:38] to that baby hallelujah is gonna produce
[54:40] some falls
[54:44] but it's for her or his good hallelujah
[54:47] that push is for the good hallelujah
[54:49] because once they fall
[54:51] hallelujah i remember when i was when i
[54:52] was when i was a kid
[54:55] i was playing football and i loved to
[54:56] play football but my first initial
[54:59] introduction to football we had to put
[55:01] the pads on and all the stuff
[55:02] i was 10 years old we put the pads on
[55:04] and all that stuff and i was
[55:06] worried about somebody hitting me and
[55:08] y'all i got hit
[55:09] and i didn't feel anything and i was
[55:11] like oh oh
[55:13] so you mean i can run full speed and ram
[55:15] somebody and ain't gonna feel anything
[55:18] oh man i like this boy hallelujah
[55:21] i love this hallelujah why holy i didn't
[55:24] feel nothing hallelujah so i could give
[55:26] a little bit more
[55:28] i could give a little bit more effort
[55:29] hallelujah and church
[55:31] as a child falls
[55:34] really when it's falling what's
[55:36] happening is it's increasing
[55:38] its balance
[55:43] it takes a fall to increase
[55:46] your foundation to increase your
[55:49] stability hallelujah
[55:51] so as that child falls hallelujah it
[55:54] learns with every step hallelujah
[55:56] how to balance itself why because they
[55:58] remember
[55:59] what it's like to fall
[56:04] god pushes us so the real potential in
[56:08] you
[56:09] can come out and you know before you
[56:12] know it
[56:13] one parent is you know behind i don't
[56:15] know if it was you bro jason i know me
[56:17] i was behind my girls and boys standing
[56:20] there
[56:20] just just in case they fail they'll fall
[56:23] in my arms
[56:26] church if we fall we're christian
[56:28] believers we're falling into the arms of
[56:30] god
[56:31] hallelujah and all he's going to do is
[56:34] pick us back up
[56:35] and say try it again pick us back up and
[56:38] try it again
[56:38] that's why the bible says a righteous
[56:40] man fallen
[56:42] seven times
[56:45] but he gets back up again that's what
[56:48] makes him righteous
[56:49] he gets back up to try again
[56:53] he doesn't wallow into it holy the bible
[56:56] says
[56:57] in that same verse of scripture that
[56:58] talks about the sinful man
[57:01] he goes into mischief when he falls
[57:04] but church listen like i said like the
[57:07] baby the baby falls and
[57:09] as it's falling it's really increasing
[57:11] this balance hallelujah
[57:13] so then it gets to a place hallelujah
[57:15] before it falls
[57:16] the balance kicks in
[57:21] it kicks into a place to walking becomes
[57:24] normal
[57:24] yeah there you go remember walking
[57:28] used to be a child
[57:31] it used to be a child to that baby it
[57:34] used to be something he was scared of
[57:37] it used to be something that would hurt
[57:38] it but then he gets a place

[1:01:40] which is the most he said which is the
[1:01:43] most thought of
[1:01:45] your servant or your son or your
[1:01:47] daughter
[1:01:48] oh my listen to this prayer from a saint
[1:01:52] will go a million times higher than an

[1:02:24] daughter
[1:02:25] according to god's vindicated prophet
[1:02:27] hallelujah
[1:02:28] he said our prayers go a million miles
[1:02:32] higher than a sinless angel
[1:02:36] an angel that's never done any wrong an
[1:02:39] angel that's never even had a bad
[1:02:41] thought
[1:02:42] amen but when you pray
[1:02:46] look at your position church

[1:03:16] saint will go a
[1:03:17] million times higher than an angel yes
[1:03:19] sir because he's a son
[1:03:22] oh probably like where the prophecy
[1:03:24] probably said whoa
[1:03:26] yeah there you go
[1:03:30] that inspiration is coming to a prophet
[1:03:33] and he almost can't believe it
[1:03:35] you don't study for stuff like this it
[1:03:38] comes afresh
[1:03:40] it's god hunger reminding the people
[1:03:43] of their position
[1:03:44] [Applause]
[1:03:46] amen he can't pull the scripture out hey
[1:03:49] yeah well you can't put a scripture out

[1:03:58] sister

[1:04:21] purpose hallelujah
[1:04:22] amen and you know one of those in there
[1:04:25] was he wanted to restore eden
[1:04:28] hallelujah and another one was he wanted
[1:04:30] to have the preeminence in the believer

[1:06:24] you know to to adjust our balance and
[1:06:27] our our reaction you know it's it's
[1:06:30] almost
[1:06:31] it's almost always your reaction that
[1:06:33] gets you in trouble
[1:06:34] not a lot of time your action because
[1:06:36] actions you know you can think it
[1:06:38] through and avoid it but sometimes you
[1:06:40] get caught off guard
[1:06:41] and you have the wrong reaction and you
[1:06:44] know a lot of times we we can see the
[1:06:46] things that are going on in the world
[1:06:48] today
[1:06:49] and uh hey deb come on back and uh sing
[1:06:51] that song for me

[1:06:58] right there and and uh i've asked sister
[1:07:00] debra to help me with a song i love it
[1:07:02] and uh one of my favorite songs i was
[1:07:04] learning some history about it tonight
[1:07:06] just blew my mind did you ever find out
[1:07:08] if that was in the time of taylor or you
[1:07:10] didn't you don't know yet
[1:07:11] you don't know or i don't know okay so
[1:07:14] amen it's quite an amazing song
[1:07:16] um that i've loved for years but we'll
[1:07:19] have her sing it just in a few minutes
[1:07:21] uh just get her in position amen but
[1:07:24] you know this the whole what a year
[1:07:28] man what a what a year we've had what
[1:07:32] i i was so glad to see 2020
[1:07:35] in the rear view mirror now you say
[1:07:39] well brother jason you know how do you
[1:07:41] know 2021
[1:07:42] will be any better i i don't expect it
[1:07:45] to be better
[1:07:46] but at least you know now i i think that
[1:07:49] we've come
[1:07:50] we've we've we've had enough falling and
[1:07:52] enough stumbling around
[1:07:53] that we've learned how to walk in these
[1:07:56] kinds of times i
[1:07:58] i so appreciate that i was this morning
[1:08:00] uh on my bible study with those brothers
[1:08:02] on the west coast and
[1:08:04] and uh different ones and brother dale
[1:08:06] was in there he started joining in with
[1:08:08] me and
[1:08:08] some brother jack from florida and
[1:08:10] there's some brothers from florida and
[1:08:12] man we're starting to get a nice little
[1:08:14] gang of brothers every morning and those
[1:08:15] west coast brothers have to get up at
[1:08:16] 4am
[1:08:18] to do that y'all remember brother
[1:08:20] esteban when he was here
[1:08:21] and he's one of those that is on there
[1:08:23] and we were talking about that very
[1:08:24] thing this morning
[1:08:26] about how that atom and it sounds it
[1:08:29] sounds upside down it sounds
[1:08:32] counter-intuitive
[1:08:33] to suggest that adam is a more complete
[1:08:38] son once he comes in contact with
[1:08:40] redemption
[1:08:41] having needing redeemed and gets
[1:08:43] redeemed
[1:08:44] he's a greater masterpiece than before
[1:08:47] he understands it
[1:08:48] see there was a time when adam brother
[1:08:50] branham called him god's masterpiece but
[1:08:53] in a sense he was because he was in the
[1:08:55] image of god
[1:08:56] but adam didn't know anything about sin
[1:08:58] adam didn't know anything about redeemer
[1:09:00] i didn't know anything about a healer
[1:09:02] and so god
[1:09:03] desiring to express his attributes
[1:09:06] and we find that adam and i love how
[1:09:09] that brother diggs
[1:09:10] just so nailed that down that adam with
[1:09:13] his eyes wide
[1:09:15] open knew that he was the son of god
[1:09:19] and he knew that if that if he gave his
[1:09:22] seed to this fallen woman
[1:09:24] god couldn't kill her because
[1:09:27] his seed the bible doesn't say adam was
[1:09:30] the son of god
[1:09:30] the bible says he was the son of god
[1:09:33] that's a pretty strong
[1:09:34] statement he was the son of god and
[1:09:36] there was nothing about adam
[1:09:38] that could be eternally separated from
[1:09:40] god think about that friends
[1:09:42] there is nothing that you could ever do
[1:09:45] in this life
[1:09:46] come what may you can never be eternally
[1:09:48] separated from god
[1:09:50] because you were always in him and
[1:09:52] brother branham says god's already seen
[1:09:54] the whole thing finished up he said it's
[1:09:56] finished up with god a long time ago
[1:09:57] in god's man god's understanding he's
[1:09:59] already got you on the other side
[1:10:01] already enjoying heavenly places my but
[1:10:04] here we are you know we got to go
[1:10:05] through the shadow of a life
[1:10:07] amen boy you left the preacher up here i
[1:10:10] better be careful
[1:10:11] oh my i have longed to be back in my
[1:10:14] pulpit i've
[1:10:16] been away for a little bit and i uh just
[1:10:18] wanted to give you a little bit of
[1:10:19] update
[1:10:20] so uh brother matt i think ends his
[1:10:22] quarantine if i'm not mistaken
[1:10:24] maybe tomorrow or friday i can't
[1:10:26] remember um
[1:10:28] his family sister rachel and the
[1:10:30] children have tested all tested negative
[1:10:32] i tested and tested negative
[1:10:34] and uh what i had obviously was just a
[1:10:37] head cold it was a
[1:10:38] there's actually a there was another you
[1:10:40] know head cold kind of a bug going
[1:10:42] around my daughter-in-law katie caught
[1:10:44] it and
[1:10:44] wondered if she had coveted she tested
[1:10:46] and tested negative
[1:10:47] so um all is well in our families
[1:10:50] brother matt's completely fully
[1:10:51] right his reign uh already you know been
[1:10:54] back full steam
[1:10:56] and so while we were we're we'll be able
[1:10:59] uh to be past all of that so i'm happy
[1:11:02] in the lord tonight
[1:11:04] and you know something friends this has
[1:11:06] been a
[1:11:07] we've called it over and over again you
[1:11:10] know
[1:11:10] just a strange year strange and
[1:11:12] unsettling
[1:11:14] time that we've been in but do you do
[1:11:16] you realize that
[1:11:18] they're already uh they knew it was
[1:11:20] coming
[1:11:21] and it's actually already been confirmed
[1:11:24] i think they had their first case in
[1:11:25] colorado
[1:11:26] either today or yes i think it was
[1:11:28] yesterday the day before where
[1:11:30] the covid 19 has already mutated it's
[1:11:32] already now
[1:11:33] a new more uh they think it's even more
[1:11:37] contagious now
[1:11:38] fortunately they're thinking that the
[1:11:40] vaccines they're developing
[1:11:42] if they work on the sars2 coveted 19
[1:11:46] then it'll also work on this mutation
[1:11:48] but that always happens satan ain't
[1:11:50] never going to be finished till god
[1:11:51] finishes him
[1:11:52] amen you just remember that remember i
[1:11:54] told you in the beginning of the year
[1:11:56] of this year i said listen when this
[1:11:58] one's over there'll be five more behind
[1:12:00] that
[1:12:00] and and ten more behind those five that
[1:12:03] you have to get it through your head the
[1:12:05] world is burning down it's going into a
[1:12:07] tribulation
[1:12:08] you can't stay here it's time to get out
[1:12:12] and you know i want to see us be
[1:12:15] prepared we have a lot of
[1:12:17] things that we want to accomplish and i
[1:12:20] i find myself going into 2021
[1:12:24] with the same astonishment and amazement
[1:12:27] that i
[1:12:28] went into 2020 with you know um
[1:12:31] never imagining in our you know and
[1:12:34] and and i can speak authoritatively
[1:12:36] because i'm
[1:12:38] you know a little bit unique in some
[1:12:39] regards to most of you here
[1:12:42] um i've been in this message my whole
[1:12:43] life i was raised up in it my mom and
[1:12:45] dad were
[1:12:46] as you know in the meetings and and i
[1:12:48] grew up
[1:12:49] in message churches and i can tell you i
[1:12:51] was i was in the circles growing up
[1:12:54] of uh the great the great warriors of
[1:12:57] yesteryear many of them most all of them
[1:12:59] going on now
[1:13:00] and uh you know even brother eddie
[1:13:02] included in that and none of them
[1:13:04] none of them imagined for a second that
[1:13:07] we would actually
[1:13:08] had here we are 20 years deep
[1:13:12] into the 21st century and it blows our
[1:13:15] minds but you know something
[1:13:17] we also at the same exact time we can
[1:13:20] look by bible prophecy
[1:13:22] and we can know that no other age
[1:13:25] has ever been so close to seeing
[1:13:28] every last prophecy before the coming of
[1:13:31] the lord
[1:13:32] completely fulfilled completely in place
[1:13:36] and i want to say to you and this may i
[1:13:38] would probably need a sermon
[1:13:40] just to qualify this statement i won't
[1:13:43] take the time tonight
[1:13:44] but maybe we'll get there sunday but i'm
[1:13:47] gonna tell you something friends
[1:13:49] here we are and it's 20 21
[1:13:53] on the eve of it but i gotta say to you
[1:13:56] it makes sense to me i never saw it
[1:13:59] coming
[1:14:00] i you if you had to talk to me you know
[1:14:02] in
[1:14:03] in in the 1980s or 1990s or even in
[1:14:06] right around the turn of the century i'd
[1:14:08] have never saw it going to 2020
[1:14:10] but now that i'm here headed into 2021
[1:14:12] and i
[1:14:13] see what's happening in the world
[1:14:16] i see what's happening at every level
[1:14:18] whether it's politics or religion
[1:14:20] the ecumenical movement social
[1:14:23] conditions
[1:14:23] no entertainment industry no matter what
[1:14:25] you want to say and
[1:14:27] and the falling away even with people
[1:14:30] who
[1:14:31] uh who walked in the ranks of the
[1:14:33] message of the hour
[1:14:35] and and even the not just of falling
[1:14:38] away but a turning
[1:14:39] against and becoming an opposer of it
[1:14:42] that was unprecedented until this day
[1:14:45] you never had that back
[1:14:47] in the day i'm here to tell you that i
[1:14:50] see where we are now when i look back
[1:14:52] when i look at it in hindsight at my age
[1:14:55] i just say
[1:14:56] well i never expected it but i do get it
[1:14:59] i do get it and i want to tell you
[1:15:01] something there is not
[1:15:03] one single thing out of cater
[1:15:06] god has not lost control at all
[1:15:10] and fact is he is he is really
[1:15:13] demonstrating his greatness and his
[1:15:17] power
[1:15:18] and his control over his family more
[1:15:20] than in any other age
[1:15:22] because never has it age been so
[1:15:24] impossible
[1:15:26] for believers to stay spiritually minded
[1:15:28] and strong
[1:15:29] and to accomplish the word of god and
[1:15:32] yet here we are doing it
[1:15:34] here we are in an age of impossibility
[1:15:37] and yet
[1:15:39] god is doing more in us than we can even
[1:15:42] comprehend and even be aware of
[1:15:47] i am looking forward to 2021
[1:15:50] i hope it's i hope that we never see
[1:15:54] 2022.
[1:15:55] amen i hope we would never see 2021
[1:15:59] and i stand here tonight and i hope we
[1:16:01] won't see 2022
[1:16:02] i wouldn't it be amazing to say 2021
[1:16:06] would be the year that we've waited on
[1:16:08] and and and on that morning that i could
[1:16:10] wake up
[1:16:11] and and here's brother eddie back in my
[1:16:13] living room again and
[1:16:14] here's your loved ones back in the
[1:16:16] living room again and i realize and i
[1:16:18] look around and i see that i'm back
[1:16:19] young and i say the day
[1:16:21] i've waited for my whole life oh what a
[1:16:25] morning that's gonna be friends
[1:16:26] what a morning it gives me courage
[1:16:29] i feel more courage
[1:16:32] than i've ever felt yeah i feel more
[1:16:35] drive
[1:16:36] than i've ever felt and it should be the
[1:16:39] opposite i stand in astonishment
[1:16:42] i stand here in astonishment to say with
[1:16:45] what 2020 has been for me
[1:16:47] at a personal level and the trial and
[1:16:49] you're all as a church aware of the
[1:16:51] trial that sister debbie and i
[1:16:53] walked together hand in hand over the
[1:16:55] last half year
[1:16:56] and and here i stand on the backside of
[1:16:59] it
[1:16:59] and sister debbie completely recovered
[1:17:02] oh by the way the last thing that was
[1:17:04] to come was her sleeping uh was to come
[1:17:06] back where she
[1:17:07] where she could sleep without any
[1:17:09] assistance and she's sleeping like a
[1:17:10] baby
[1:17:11] i even got up this morning had to wake
[1:17:12] her up so she's doing good
[1:17:15] and uh you know when your nervous system
[1:17:18] gets that broken
[1:17:19] you know it can take a little while i'm
[1:17:20] quite sure she's still got some
[1:17:22] some internal healing but as far as all
[1:17:24] those symptoms i tell you
[1:17:26] the devil tries to irritate her with a
[1:17:28] little bit of a buzz in her tongue
[1:17:30] and and i think that's just the last
[1:17:32] little salt grain that's vanishing away
[1:17:34] amen but you know i just tell the devil
[1:17:37] all the time brother diggs i tell him
[1:17:38] all the time
[1:17:39] you ain't nobody satan you ain't nobody
[1:17:42] you're a puppet
[1:17:44] in the hands of my daddy my daddy is in
[1:17:47] control of my life my life as brother
[1:17:50] abraham
[1:17:50] myra always says we do not live
[1:17:54] by the mercies of satan by the mercies
[1:17:56] of lucifer we live
[1:17:58] by the mercies of jesus christ and i
[1:18:02] remind that you say you better be
[1:18:03] careful the devil might hear you say
[1:18:05] that i'm not
[1:18:06] i'm not trying to to you know i'm not
[1:18:09] trying to meet him on those kind of
[1:18:10] terms i'm not trying to
[1:18:12] you know face off with him in some
[1:18:13] street fight in a back alley
[1:18:15] i can't whip him but my my daddy can
[1:18:18] whip him
[1:18:18] and already did whip him and i know that
[1:18:21] my father has control
[1:18:23] of my life i'm only stating the obvious
[1:18:25] my life
[1:18:26] and my times are in his hands
[1:18:29] and i've already got the promise of the
[1:18:31] word that i win
[1:18:32] so why should i worry about losing if
[1:18:35] i'm already promised to win
[1:18:38] how crazy would that be yeah how crazy
[1:18:41] would it be to worry about losing
[1:18:43] when you have the promise that you're
[1:18:44] going to win amen
[1:18:47] how crazy would it be to take the word
[1:18:49] of the devil
[1:18:50] who's never been able to defeat the one
[1:18:52] who gave you the promise
[1:18:55] and god has never ever
[1:18:58] ever ever did i say ever
[1:19:02] he has never ever lost a battle
[1:19:05] to anything or anything and and
[1:19:09] every time satan has challenged him
[1:19:11] without the exception of even one time
[1:19:14] whenever he's challenged the holy ghost
[1:19:16] he's always lost
[1:19:18] amen and i tell you something friends
[1:19:21] when you realize
[1:19:22] that you are a part of god when you
[1:19:24] realize that you are
[1:19:26] actually included in the literal godhead
[1:19:29] reality of christ
[1:19:31] and brother branham taught us that so
[1:19:33] very clearly that
[1:19:34] that we literally are a part of him
[1:19:37] literally a part of god in that great
[1:19:40] equation
[1:19:42] that makes up god that's why that's why
[1:19:44] you're a believer because
[1:19:46] brother rahm said you believe the word
[1:19:47] because it's a part of you
[1:19:50] it's you haven't been persuaded into
[1:19:52] this nobody convinced you of it
[1:19:54] nobody can dissuade you from it nobody
[1:19:57] can convince you
[1:19:58] otherwise you're a believer even in
[1:20:01] things you don't understand because you
[1:20:02] know god said it that settles it i'm a
[1:20:04] believer
[1:20:05] i just believe it you know why you know
[1:20:07] why
[1:20:08] i believe it because that's what
[1:20:10] believers do
[1:20:12] they believe and with the trials of
[1:20:16] 2020 and with covid
[1:20:20] and and the ups and downs and the ins
[1:20:23] and outs and our church schedule on and
[1:20:25] off and
[1:20:25] you know we we were saying here recently
[1:20:28] that
[1:20:29] you know i said it to the church and i
[1:20:30] meant it quite seriously and i i
[1:20:32] so say i again tonight you know as a
[1:20:35] church
[1:20:36] and not just this church but churches
[1:20:38] around the world covet has taken
[1:20:40] something from us and i'm going to tell
[1:20:42] you something friends i want it back
[1:20:45] i want it back i want to i don't like
[1:20:48] seeing that people have lost ground and
[1:20:50] yet i do
[1:20:50] see that some and it's impossible not to
[1:20:53] lose ground
[1:20:54] i mean just while i was while i was in
[1:20:57] quarantine and couldn't even come here
[1:20:59] to this church
[1:21:00] just a couple of services i said to my
[1:21:03] wife i said
[1:21:04] i don't see how i do not see how people
[1:21:09] cannot have uh and come to church
[1:21:12] and hear the live preaching and have the
[1:21:13] fellowship of the saints and just be
[1:21:15] able to come here
[1:21:17] how do they even stay christians i don't
[1:21:19] even know
[1:21:21] just the power of god in their lives
[1:21:24] i'll give them credit man they
[1:21:25] they must have something more than me
[1:21:27] because i'm going to tell you something
[1:21:28] i have felt the impact of not standing
[1:21:32] here
[1:21:32] and let's say oh it's just a building
[1:21:34] brick and mortar and wood and chairs
[1:21:36] i get that friends but i'm going to tell
[1:21:37] you something god
[1:21:39] gathers here do you know how i know god
[1:21:42] gathers here
[1:21:44] because you gather here amen and not
[1:21:47] only does he promise to gather where two
[1:21:49] or three of you gather in his name
[1:21:51] but he gathers in you and you
[1:21:54] sitting here you are his family
[1:21:57] you are the bride the purchase
[1:22:00] the bride of the lord jesus christ
[1:22:03] that's no small thing
[1:22:05] don't let the devil you know devalue
[1:22:09] your heritage don't let him take that
[1:22:11] away from you
[1:22:13] as brother diggs was preaching on that
[1:22:14] tonight listen adam
[1:22:16] adam may have sinned and lost his
[1:22:18] position
[1:22:19] but he never lost his identity with god
[1:22:22] and i've said it before and i'll say it
[1:22:23] again
[1:22:24] tonight there is no earthly condition
[1:22:26] that can change your heavenly position
[1:22:28] you started in christ guess what you
[1:22:31] will finish in christ
[1:22:33] amen i believe that with all my heart
[1:22:37] we have a lot of things that we want to
[1:22:39] do
[1:22:40] in 2021 and i've
[1:22:43] you know i've made some adjustments uh
[1:22:45] one of the things that i get asked
[1:22:46] often is concerning the podcast that we
[1:22:49] want to do
[1:22:50] and i have made an adjustment to that
[1:22:54] because i didn't have just one podcast i
[1:22:56] wanted to do i actually had several that
[1:22:58] i wanted to do
[1:22:59] and um two or at least two of them uh
[1:23:02] maybe even a third one
[1:23:04] will just be a podcast of my own and
[1:23:07] then we also wanted to have a podcast of
[1:23:09] the whole ministry team here
[1:23:11] and then brother jason already has uh
[1:23:14] already i don't
[1:23:14] i'm sure y'all know it by now in the
[1:23:16] mornings uh
[1:23:18] that he is on a youtube live streaming
[1:23:20] and i've been able to drop in a few
[1:23:22] times when i'm not preparing
[1:23:24] for my bible study which starts
[1:23:26] immediately on the heels of that
[1:23:27] sometimes i'll listen in the background
[1:23:30] oh well i'm getting ready for that
[1:23:31] morning bible study i'm in that every
[1:23:32] day
[1:23:33] and i've took a a a few days off while i
[1:23:36] felt bad and the brothers covered for me
[1:23:38] but we have such a good time in there
[1:23:41] and such wonderful ministry in there i'm
[1:23:43] so enjoying it
[1:23:45] but but i've actually taken a few steps
[1:23:47] just to fyi
[1:23:49] um got some other equipment so that i
[1:23:52] will be
[1:23:52] able to at least until we can get up to
[1:23:55] full steam
[1:23:56] and we're not going to be able to do it
[1:23:57] just yet we want to do it
[1:24:01] to say all things are ready a lot of
[1:24:03] things are ready for it but we're not
[1:24:05] quite
[1:24:05] impositioned for it perfectly however i
[1:24:08] do
[1:24:08] uh have managed to get some things that
[1:24:11] i will be putting in position
[1:24:13] uh very quickly i'm talking within the
[1:24:15] first week of the new year
[1:24:17] i should be at least one or two
[1:24:20] of the individual podcasts that i want
[1:24:22] to do livestream on
[1:24:23] youtube and facebook and our church
[1:24:25] website they'll be posted there
[1:24:27] and there's some things that i want to
[1:24:29] do there a couple of ideas that i've got
[1:24:32] um and so i wanted to kind of give you
[1:24:35] that
[1:24:36] uh little heads up on that we
[1:24:39] are looking to go into the new year
[1:24:41] strong and i want to
[1:24:45] encourage you as a church to
[1:24:48] cast down fear i want to tell you
[1:24:50] something friends i wanted to speak to
[1:24:52] those of you
[1:24:53] who have felt too much fear to be back
[1:24:57] in
[1:24:58] regular church services i want to
[1:25:00] encourage you
[1:25:02] to ask the lord and pray and i'm going
[1:25:05] to pray for you specifically
[1:25:06] and ask the lord to give you the courage
[1:25:10] to reassemble on a regular basis if you
[1:25:13] don't
[1:25:13] okay god bless you i get it i'm i'm
[1:25:17] determined
[1:25:17] not to press anyone uh beyond uh their
[1:25:21] faith but i'm i'm gonna tell you
[1:25:22] something friends as a shepherd
[1:25:25] i can see that this staying out of
[1:25:28] church and just streaming all the time
[1:25:29] has taken quite a bit from some of you
[1:25:32] and i
[1:25:33] that hurts my heart see i i want to see
[1:25:35] you strong
[1:25:36] in the lord strong in the power of his
[1:25:39] might strong
[1:25:40] in faith i want to see your schedules
[1:25:42] manipulated i've got
[1:25:44] i've got people that i'm praying for
[1:25:47] and uh who's whose work schedules
[1:25:51] uh keep them from being at church often
[1:25:54] on wednesdays and sundays and i'm i'm
[1:25:56] praying been praying for a little while
[1:25:58] that god will change that and i'm just
[1:26:00] waiting for him to come to me
[1:26:02] and say man i'm having all kinds of
[1:26:03] problem on my job and i'm going to say
[1:26:05] well there's a reason behind that
[1:26:08] and i might it might be uh you know um
[1:26:11] might be causing you some some trouble
[1:26:14] but
[1:26:14] but i want to see god's family in the
[1:26:17] house of god
[1:26:19] and i pray it constantly lord and i'll
[1:26:22] name the person that's in my mind and
[1:26:23] then i'll name the next one i'll name
[1:26:25] the next one
[1:26:26] i want to see it lord i want you to do
[1:26:28] whatever you need to do
[1:26:29] in their life or their career or
[1:26:31] whatever to see that they can be
[1:26:33] in the house of god with their families
[1:26:36] uh
[1:26:37] so uh if if things start go sideways on
[1:26:40] you well
[1:26:40] just chuck that up to me praying for you
[1:26:43] amen
[1:26:44] so i want to see the fear dissolve
[1:26:47] because listen friends
[1:26:49] until we get out of here i mean as i
[1:26:53] said earlier 2021's not going to be
[1:26:55] better than 2020.
[1:26:56] right so what are you going to do just
[1:26:58] hide in fear forever
[1:27:00] when are you finally going to just throw
[1:27:02] it down and say i'm not given the spirit
[1:27:05] of fear
[1:27:06] i'm given the spirit of a sound mind
[1:27:08] that's what the promise of adoption is
[1:27:11] that you are not given the spirit of
[1:27:13] fear
[1:27:13] stop fearing fear as brother ernie says
[1:27:16] f-e-a-r is false evidence appearing real
[1:27:20] and i'm going to hear i'm here to tell
[1:27:21] you if god can keep a hold of your soul
[1:27:24] he can keep a hold of your body he can
[1:27:26] keep a hold of your family he's all
[1:27:28] powerful
[1:27:29] in case you haven't heard recently he's
[1:27:32] all powerful
[1:27:33] and i would rather see you uh put a foot
[1:27:36] forward
[1:27:37] in faith and trust the lord and i
[1:27:40] i want to see that i i hope that we
[1:27:42] don't have to
[1:27:43] uh of course we're going to continue to
[1:27:45] operate in prudence we're still going to
[1:27:47] operate um in wisdom we've
[1:27:51] managed by the grace of god by the way
[1:27:53] that the decisions that we've made as a
[1:27:56] group
[1:27:57] and i've i've striven to not make them
[1:28:00] arbitrarily
[1:28:01] and the brothers and the other officers
[1:28:03] the deacons and the trustees and the
[1:28:05] ministry team
[1:28:06] i'm sure would testify to you tonight if
[1:28:08] you ask them that
[1:28:09] that brother jason has consulted the
[1:28:11] team time and time again time and time
[1:28:14] again we talk it out
[1:28:15] uh we've we've met in person we've
[1:28:18] talked on the phone we meet in chat
[1:28:20] uh and i'm i'm i'm open for everyone's
[1:28:23] opinion
[1:28:24] um and and i and and the brothers know
[1:28:26] i'm gonna take every all the advice i
[1:28:28] get because i want it
[1:28:30] and i'm gonna pray about it all and i'm
[1:28:32] gonna follow what i
[1:28:34] feel is the mind of the lord and uh and
[1:28:36] they
[1:28:37] they trust me and uh and i know you do
[1:28:39] and and
[1:28:40] and i'll tell you something friends you
[1:28:41] can you know why you can trust me
[1:28:43] because i trust him
[1:28:45] and i know he won't mislead us i know
[1:28:48] that if brother branham taught us that
[1:28:50] that in
[1:28:50] important matters that that when you
[1:28:53] don't know what to do and you've got an
[1:28:55] important decision
[1:28:56] to make that you've got to bring your
[1:28:58] heart down to neutral before god and
[1:29:00] just
[1:29:00] come to a point in the presence of god
[1:29:03] where you can say lord
[1:29:04] whatever is your will i'm ready to do it
[1:29:08] i just need to know what it is
[1:29:10] and that's the kind of man that god will
[1:29:12] speak to and in fact is brother branham
[1:29:13] said if he doesn't
[1:29:15] and there and he doesn't speak and
[1:29:17] there's not a vision or prophecy or
[1:29:19] leading that's very strong or lead you
[1:29:22] into a scripture
[1:29:23] or something he said then you just do
[1:29:25] the best way you can feel in your heart
[1:29:27] and there's been times i've had to do
[1:29:28] that
[1:29:29] and brother branham said this he said
[1:29:30] because i i do not believe
[1:29:33] that god would let a man that sincere
[1:29:36] who
[1:29:36] who don't know what to do but he's
[1:29:38] trying to do the right thing
[1:29:39] and he's asking god to help him and he
[1:29:41] means it and he's he's humble
[1:29:43] and he's ready to do whatever god wants
[1:29:45] to do and he don't know exactly he said
[1:29:48] and he said i don't believe god would
[1:29:50] let that kind of a man make a mistake
[1:29:54] and if he is making a mistake then god
[1:29:56] is obligated to turn him around
[1:29:59] and put him back on the right path
[1:30:00] because god can't respect persons and
[1:30:02] that was what paul ran into
[1:30:04] uh you know and and paul brother branham
[1:30:06] said he prayed all night and
[1:30:08] he waited on god and god never spoke and
[1:30:10] he got up the next morning he didn't
[1:30:11] know what to do
[1:30:12] he said he just went what the best way
[1:30:14] he could feel in his heart and he
[1:30:15] saddled his mule
[1:30:16] and headed off in one direction and he
[1:30:18] said a vision broke before
[1:30:20] him and a man from macedonia waving at
[1:30:22] him saying brother paul
[1:30:23] come our way brother and said he just
[1:30:25] turned his meal around
[1:30:26] and went that way and so i'm going to
[1:30:28] tell you some of the friends
[1:30:30] i i i have proven i stand here before
[1:30:33] you today
[1:30:35] and i can say and if i said it any other
[1:30:37] way i'd just be
[1:30:38] lying i have never seen that fail
[1:30:41] whenever i've been able to meet god and
[1:30:44] pray my way to neutrality
[1:30:47] now you can't brother branham said you
[1:30:49] can't even ask god for his will if
[1:30:50] you're not neutral
[1:30:51] right he said first you've got to pray
[1:30:54] to get neutral because if you don't
[1:30:55] you'll have your feelings in on the
[1:30:57] prayer and you'll imagine god gives you
[1:31:00] permission when he never
[1:31:01] even opened his mouth because it's your
[1:31:04] own desires wanting to do it and you'll
[1:31:06] trick your own self and i've done that
[1:31:07] too
[1:31:09] i've made that mistake and boy i tell
[1:31:11] you what
[1:31:12] you know what you when you when you fall
[1:31:14] enough you master walking
[1:31:17] i love that brother at one at one point
[1:31:20] for that little child
[1:31:22] walking used to be a trial until he
[1:31:25] mastered it
[1:31:26] and that's so beautiful i want to tell
[1:31:28] you something it's like that in life you
[1:31:30] know until you master running until you
[1:31:31] master riding a bicycle until you master
[1:31:33] swimming
[1:31:34] it's a trial it's stress it's anxiety
[1:31:37] but once you
[1:31:38] master it wow then you're you're never
[1:31:40] free it's like riding a bike you never
[1:31:42] forget it
[1:31:43] and i tell you i've learned you know how
[1:31:45] to trust god and i've learned how to
[1:31:47] stay before him until i'm neutral i've
[1:31:49] learned how to just
[1:31:50] you know kick it out of gear brother
[1:31:52] ernie how's that he says that he says
[1:31:56] that that uh patience i think it's i
[1:31:59] think it's patience
[1:32:00] he said real faith he says
[1:32:03] faith is idling your motor
[1:32:07] when you feel like stripping the gears
[1:32:10] and so
[1:32:11] when you feel like just laying it to it
[1:32:13] and stripping the gears he said you just
[1:32:15] idle idle the motor and just wait on the
[1:32:17] lord
[1:32:17] and i have learned in all directions to
[1:32:20] wait on the lord
[1:32:22] and uh there's been many times friends
[1:32:24] you know
[1:32:26] even even i've had it sometimes and i
[1:32:28] can testify to this as well
[1:32:30] when you can when you trust god when you
[1:32:33] really trust him
[1:32:34] and i mean it ain't no joke you really
[1:32:36] do trust him and he knows it because you
[1:32:38] can't
[1:32:38] you can't hide it from him anyway so you
[1:32:40] might as well be honest
[1:32:41] how are you going to hide it from god so
[1:32:43] just come to him in honesty
[1:32:45] and you you might need to say lord i
[1:32:47] believe but help thou my unbelief
[1:32:50] that's not going to offend him he's
[1:32:51] heard that request before
[1:32:53] he met that need before and so you know
[1:32:56] i
[1:32:56] i've had to come to god that way before
[1:32:58] but but when i come to him really
[1:33:00] trusting him there's been times where
[1:33:03] i and you know even within my own flesh
[1:33:06] was was ready and a reaction as i was
[1:33:08] talking about earlier not always action
[1:33:10] sometimes it's a reaction
[1:33:11] and ready to react and go put my hands
[1:33:13] on a situation and just take the bull by
[1:33:16] the horns
[1:33:16] you know how you can get sometimes and
[1:33:18] the lord literally
[1:33:19] run ahead of me and interdict and block
[1:33:22] me literally block me from doing it
[1:33:24] and then within a day or two later it
[1:33:26] fixed itself and was smooth as silk and
[1:33:28] i realized i had to blow the whole thing
[1:33:29] to pieces
[1:33:30] i'm going to tell you something i want
[1:33:31] to give you a testimony from a man
[1:33:34] who's been who's been a christian a long
[1:33:36] time and i've been
[1:33:37] preaching the gospel many years and and
[1:33:40] was
[1:33:41] you know working in the ministry a
[1:33:44] decade before i started pulpit preaching
[1:33:46] i was working in the ministry
[1:33:48] and i i i can tell you that you
[1:33:51] can trust the lord he is trustworthy
[1:33:56] you can put you can rest in
[1:33:59] christ you can rest in his promise you
[1:34:02] don't have to be stressed
[1:34:04] amen you don't have to be you don't have
[1:34:07] to suffer anxiety
[1:34:09] just give it to him he already knows
[1:34:12] what to do
[1:34:13] he already knows what you need he
[1:34:15] understa a lot of times
[1:34:16] he'll start doing for you in the way
[1:34:19] that you think is the opposite
[1:34:22] see of what he should be doing that's
[1:34:24] only because he knows what you need
[1:34:26] better
[1:34:27] than you and you you want it to go a
[1:34:29] certain way because you think you have a
[1:34:31] certain need
[1:34:32] he's looking at going actually that's
[1:34:34] not really your problem so i'm going to
[1:34:36] go over here and fix your problem it's
[1:34:37] going to look weird to you but just
[1:34:38] trust me
[1:34:39] it'll all come out and it does every
[1:34:42] single time
[1:34:44] we want to you know we've had a a a a
[1:34:47] great desire to
[1:34:49] to really double down uh on missions
[1:34:52] and it's been it's been quiet for 2020
[1:34:56] as far as
[1:34:57] as far as traveling but the lord is
[1:34:59] faithful i you know brother matt and i'm
[1:35:01] brother jd we've talked uh at length
[1:35:03] about
[1:35:04] missions and and brother george who
[1:35:06] helps me on our local missions here and
[1:35:08] and then brother brother jason still um
[1:35:11] runs
[1:35:11] present truth ministries which is which
[1:35:14] has not been absorbed
[1:35:15] by bethel tabernacle that's why i said
[1:35:17] when brother jason first moved here
[1:35:19] and i say to all my preacher friends
[1:35:20] listen if you've been supporting
[1:35:22] uh pete uh ptm if you've been supporting
[1:35:25] present truth ministries
[1:35:26] please keep it going because we're not
[1:35:28] absorbing it but jason simply relocated
[1:35:30] his headquarters
[1:35:31] from minnesota here to south carolina
[1:35:34] and that ministry is still going strong
[1:35:36] brother jason is still
[1:35:37] active he's not boots on the ground
[1:35:39] because it's been impossible
[1:35:41] but uh it may be that in 2021
[1:35:44] some of that will open back up he's
[1:35:46] desiring it so pray for that will you
[1:35:48] will you remember to please pray that
[1:35:50] the lord will open up
[1:35:52] travel again so that he can actually go
[1:35:54] and i have a desire
[1:35:56] maybe to visit a few of those places
[1:35:57] brother dale has went many times
[1:35:59] uh representing the church here as well
[1:36:02] and
[1:36:02] um so we want to continue to do that
[1:36:04] then we're we're also doing
[1:36:07] that's not the only thing we're involved
[1:36:08] in with missions and so
[1:36:10] you know i i have people
[1:36:13] even people to this day who don't even
[1:36:16] come to this church who used to come to
[1:36:18] it
[1:36:18] who still send in missionary support and
[1:36:21] still send in offerings and things like
[1:36:23] that and
[1:36:24] and we always appreciate that it always
[1:36:26] goes to that because we're involved in
[1:36:27] more than just
[1:36:29] uh what we're involved with in present
[1:36:31] truth ministries brother george
[1:36:32] helps me keep that organized and keeps
[1:36:34] me abreast of what's going on
[1:36:36] kind of an adasha for me and so we're
[1:36:39] that's how we came in contact with the
[1:36:41] needs in
[1:36:42] in central america that's how we came in
[1:36:44] contact with the needs
[1:36:46] uh in the philippines and so we want to
[1:36:49] continue doing that
[1:36:50] so uh you know i'm not at all uh shy
[1:36:53] about saying
[1:36:54] hey give to missions friends give to
[1:36:56] missions i know that
[1:36:58] you know even when we're when we're not
[1:37:00] here we were
[1:37:01] it was a little amusing i think brother
[1:37:04] matthew
[1:37:04] it was amusing to him and i would sister
[1:37:06] dave and i were watching
[1:37:08] sunday and he said are we still taking
[1:37:09] up an offering because nobody was really
[1:37:11] here but
[1:37:12] but uh but he mentioned that we do have
[1:37:14] the paypal accounts and we do
[1:37:16] and use them hey the church still has to
[1:37:18] pay its light bill still has to pay
[1:37:20] water bills still has to pay um you know
[1:37:22] the different expenses of the building
[1:37:24] and the cost to clean it and the
[1:37:26] ministry still has needs they still go
[1:37:28] on
[1:37:28] missions is still a constant need and it
[1:37:31] will be
[1:37:32] until the lord comes and so you know the
[1:37:34] greatest
[1:37:35] the greatest mission of this church
[1:37:37] ought to be to either go
[1:37:39] or send someone amen and so i i really
[1:37:43] want you to
[1:37:44] be faithful in your giving we have every
[1:37:47] available opportunity
[1:37:49] for you to do it and so we want you to
[1:37:51] continue to be faithful in that and we
[1:37:53] certainly appreciate the years
[1:37:56] of high high percentage
[1:38:00] of faithfulness of bethel tabernacle and
[1:38:02] i've i've been in a lot of churches and
[1:38:04] uh
[1:38:05] and it wasn't that way and so i've
[1:38:07] always been very grateful for the heart
[1:38:10] of bethel tabernacle to their ties and
[1:38:13] their offerings and missions and
[1:38:14] building and everything
[1:38:16] and you've always been over the years
[1:38:18] every time
[1:38:19] and actually the the congregation we
[1:38:21] have now is uh
[1:38:23] almost not in any way the congregation
[1:38:26] we had the first 10 years
[1:38:28] uh i think maybe
[1:38:31] um i'm sure gonna forget somebody if i
[1:38:33] start down this road but
[1:38:35] you know as far as like the old original
[1:38:37] the old original
[1:38:38] assembly other than probably brother
[1:38:41] michael and sister wanda
[1:38:43] and i know sister debbie's at home
[1:38:45] thinking of somebody i'm forgetting
[1:38:46] but um and of course my family but
[1:38:50] other than that you know the church is
[1:38:52] almost completely turned over
[1:38:54] to whole new people but at the same time
[1:38:57] it's always been a giving church that's
[1:38:59] never failed never ceased and so
[1:39:03] i appreciate that friends god bless you
[1:39:06] god bless you for that
[1:39:07] and please be praying for the missionary
[1:39:11] work that
[1:39:12] we ought to do because the needs are
[1:39:14] great we can't do them all
[1:39:16] right we can't do them all we'd love to
[1:39:17] do them all we can't do them all so we
[1:39:19] have to be selective
[1:39:20] and we don't want to choose we'd rather
[1:39:22] the lord choose amen
[1:39:24] and so we stay in prayer and we we stay
[1:39:27] before the lord on what
[1:39:28] um he would have us do because we can't
[1:39:32] do it all you know i i
[1:39:35] i hope that 2021 brings
[1:39:38] us back you know we've got meetings that
[1:39:41] we'd like to run
[1:39:42] revivals that we'd like to have in
[1:39:44] january by the will of the lord
[1:39:46] hopefully
[1:39:47] if all things stay as they are as of
[1:39:50] this point it's a go
[1:39:52] i'll be hosting a minister's meeting
[1:39:53] here in the middle of of uh january
[1:39:56] and uh we're going to have um brother
[1:39:59] uh brother jack from down jump by the
[1:40:02] jack duff now
[1:40:04] most of y'all either know him or have
[1:40:05] heard of him he pastors down in west
[1:40:08] palm wonderful wonderful wonderful
[1:40:11] brother
[1:40:12] he joins us in the mornings on the bible
[1:40:15] study and he
[1:40:16] takes at least one day a week and so
[1:40:19] whenever we have the saturday ministers
[1:40:21] meeting for ministers
[1:40:23] then on the sunday a lot of times i'll
[1:40:24] keep one of the preachers over
[1:40:26] and i've asked brother jack to stay over
[1:40:27] so that'll be on the 17th
[1:40:29] i want you to be looking forward to that
[1:40:31] and i would sure
[1:40:33] love to sometime in the spring
[1:40:36] regardless of conditions unless
[1:40:38] conditions just deteriorate horribly
[1:40:40] i sure would like to run a big spring
[1:40:42] meeting maya
[1:40:43] 2020 do you realize how many annual camp
[1:40:46] meetings had to be canceled
[1:40:48] i mean every one of them had to be some
[1:40:51] of them that had ran for 40 years
[1:40:53] plus without ceasing and others 20 and
[1:40:56] 30 years without ceasing
[1:40:57] had to be canceled i i sure want to see
[1:41:00] that
[1:41:01] come back and i'm trusting that the lord
[1:41:04] will make a way for that we've got
[1:41:08] other things that we're going to be
[1:41:10] doing i want to mention this
[1:41:12] um as you know um brother kevin
[1:41:16] and sister sarah have been hosting the
[1:41:18] financial peace university
[1:41:20] classes and we did it twice now and in
[1:41:23] fact
[1:41:23] is uh brother jason demars also has the
[1:41:26] training to do the one for small
[1:41:28] business owners because that's kind of
[1:41:30] a little bit it's a little bit different
[1:41:32] and he says he's well
[1:41:34] uh well qualified to teach that so
[1:41:36] coming
[1:41:37] in the new year we want to do some more
[1:41:39] of that and i
[1:41:41] i'm going to make an announcement and uh
[1:41:44] i
[1:41:44] trust the lord will allow me to keep the
[1:41:46] promise and i won't have to
[1:41:48] uh rescind it but in
[1:41:51] in 2020 all of the ones that we held
[1:41:55] uh we there was a tuition that you had
[1:41:58] to pay
[1:42:00] and uh we'd like to announce that when
[1:42:02] we hold them going forward
[1:42:04] uh from here on uh i'm going to cover
[1:42:06] the cost myself
[1:42:08] of any body married couples
[1:42:11] teenagers older married couples young
[1:42:14] married couples mid-grade
[1:42:15] mid-level married single doesn't matter
[1:42:18] male or female
[1:42:19] i i i don't not going to get into it
[1:42:22] tonight
[1:42:23] but there is a there is a number
[1:42:26] of of couples that could stand in this
[1:42:29] pulpit
[1:42:30] kevin and sarah not the least of which
[1:42:34] would be brother kevin and sister sarah
[1:42:36] to tell you in remarkable
[1:42:40] re stunning is is the word for it
[1:42:44] stunning results that they have had
[1:42:47] in their personal finances by observing
[1:42:51] biblical based principles that are
[1:42:53] taught
[1:42:54] in those seminars they are good they are
[1:42:57] excellent
[1:42:58] i want to see the whole church i i think
[1:43:01] every young man
[1:43:02] i think if you've got sons coming up
[1:43:04] they need to be in that class
[1:43:05] when we have them in 2021 and not just
[1:43:08] young men
[1:43:09] young women uh you know because a lot of
[1:43:12] times
[1:43:12] a lot of times it sure is the condition
[1:43:14] in my house you know where the the man
[1:43:17] either he's working in the field and
[1:43:19] he's got a maybe a small business and
[1:43:21] he's
[1:43:22] he's going you know crazy just trying to
[1:43:24] keep that going
[1:43:25] and he has really no time for the to
[1:43:28] handle the finances of the home
[1:43:29] and that's what a wife can can pull
[1:43:32] right in there and help him i
[1:43:33] appreciate sister debbie for that she's
[1:43:35] way better at keeping those things
[1:43:36] organized
[1:43:37] than i am and so um i'm not a bit too
[1:43:40] uh embarrassed to admit that that sister
[1:43:43] debbie
[1:43:44] uh manages the finances of our home and
[1:43:47] um
[1:43:47] you know i i'm because i i have all of
[1:43:49] the church responsibility and the
[1:43:51] finance of the church
[1:43:52] upon me and so sister debbie handles
[1:43:55] that and we work great together
[1:43:57] and uh you know i i encourage if the
[1:44:01] if the wife is better at it good grief
[1:44:03] let her do it
[1:44:04] my goodness what kind of crazy would you
[1:44:06] be to not do it out of some male
[1:44:08] chauvinism
[1:44:09] that would be ridiculous you know let
[1:44:11] her be a help mate to you that's what
[1:44:13] she's there for
[1:44:14] and uh and god bless his order and so
[1:44:18] amen my whole family my grandkids will
[1:44:20] tell you sister debbie is what makes our
[1:44:21] family go
[1:44:23] amen she is she is one put together
[1:44:26] uh little sister and so uh i've
[1:44:29] appreciated her
[1:44:30] her drive for years i tell the grandkids
[1:44:34] you know pablo wouldn't have nothing if
[1:44:35] it wasn't from emmal so
[1:44:38] if you need anything you go get it from
[1:44:39] memo because she'll be the one
[1:44:41] and so i appreciate a good wife in that
[1:44:44] regard
[1:44:45] and you know i want to see these classes
[1:44:47] go forward i told brother kevin
[1:44:49] that i'd be announcing that and you know
[1:44:52] uh
[1:44:52] i i would invite you to take brother
[1:44:55] kevin and sister sarah side and just let
[1:44:57] him give you their testimony
[1:44:58] take brother michael and sister wanda
[1:45:00] just just say hey give me give us the 10
[1:45:02] minute
[1:45:03] overview tell us what this did uh for
[1:45:05] your finances
[1:45:07] you know uh i mean it's it's been
[1:45:09] remarkable brother arvid and sister
[1:45:11] martha another one been remarkable the
[1:45:13] stories
[1:45:13] that they have reported back uh taking
[1:45:16] those
[1:45:17] financial peace classes has completely
[1:45:20] revolutionized
[1:45:21] uh their their finances and hey that's a
[1:45:24] boon for me
[1:45:26] if we want a spiritual church then i
[1:45:29] need spiritual families
[1:45:31] because a church just collection of
[1:45:33] families see
[1:45:34] and if i want to if we if we want to
[1:45:36] have a fine i know this sounds carnal
[1:45:38] but if we want a financially sound
[1:45:39] church i need financially sound families
[1:45:42] amen can y'all say amen to that too amen
[1:45:45] thank you
[1:45:46] uh so these things all work hand in hand
[1:45:48] friends i've said it so many times
[1:45:51] it's a it's a mantra it's a it's a
[1:45:54] philosophy
[1:45:55] you you you probably heard me say it a
[1:45:57] thousand times
[1:45:59] we're all in this thing together
[1:46:02] and there's no big eyes and little yous
[1:46:04] god has us
[1:46:05] gifted severally as he will position
[1:46:07] severally as he will
[1:46:09] and we work together as a team and i
[1:46:12] i i'm looking forward to 2021 i should

[1:50:39] read you
[1:50:40] uh a quote here from brother branham
[1:50:46] he's in the message in 1952 jesus christ
[1:50:49] the same yesterday today and forever
[1:50:52] and he says now just a moment he says
[1:50:55] slowly sister abide with me if you will
[1:50:59] and let's just kind of get near
[1:51:02] to god remember before you start praying
[1:51:05] he says look this way the angel of god
[1:51:08] whose servant i am is standing less than
[1:51:12] three feet from me right now
[1:51:14] you think i'd say that if i didn't know
[1:51:16] what i was talking about
[1:51:17] he's moving right in you can just feel
[1:51:20] it coming in
[1:51:21] it's his presence you know when i read
[1:51:24] that
[1:51:24] [Music]
[1:51:26] and i hope this is true for you
[1:51:29] when i read a quote like that i
[1:51:33] have an affinity with that i get that
[1:51:34] because
[1:51:36] i felt that presence how many have ever
[1:51:38] had those times
[1:51:39] where you're just quietly before the
[1:51:41] lord in prayer
[1:51:43] maybe you're singing a little song
[1:51:44] quietly under your breath
[1:51:46] and you just feel that sweet aroma
[1:51:49] that sweet presence of god just move in
[1:51:52] it's not
[1:51:52] lightning is not flashing that's not
[1:51:54] what i'm talking about i've had those
[1:51:55] times too where
[1:51:56] you just feel like you could run through
