========================================

[Music] Christians into that direction in that way. And again, I'll repeat it. Fathers are the gatekeeper. Fathers are the ones that either they remove themselves and they do nothing. Doing nothing is doing something. It's ruining your family. It's damaging your family. It's a It's allowing the If you were a farmer and you had a field and you just said, "Well, it's up to God to take care of the field." They would probably say, "There's something wrong with his head. Let's get him an examination." It takes work. It takes effort. It takes That's what redemption is. It takes work. It takes effort. We want to see redemption in our family. We want to re see redemption in our home. It takes effort. It takes fighting. It takes battling. And so, fathers are the the ones that are to establish this in their home. You don't just sit back and hope. A farmer doesn't just sit back and hope. A shepherd doesn't just sit back and hope. He uses all his strength, all his efforts to stand in the gap. That's that's our job as fathers and mother is to be a helper in that. You didn't think that I'd be speaking to the fathers and mothers so much when I was talking about courtship, but that's because maybe we're we're not looking at it right. The young people are not the drivers of this process, and they shouldn't be. They're a part of it. They participate in it. They're they're actively seeking the will and the mind of the Lord. But it's not without parents being involved. It's never designed to be that way. And if there's resistance, fathers, maybe you didn't start it young enough so that it isn't normal in your children's heads and now there's resistance. Maybe there's resistance from mom and the children. Well, do you have any muscles? Do you have any spiritual muscles? You'll have to take a stand. It won't be easy. You'll have to pray about it. You'll have to use wisdom. You don't use you don't use force, but you use the strength that God has given you to make sure that these standards are taught with love, with patience, and that that they're followed. I can't do it. There's already this. There's already that. With God all things are possible. That's not that's not just a statement for things that are outside of your control. Actually, it's more in a statement if because Paul went when Paul says, "I can do all things through Christ who gives me strength." Is he doing all he was able to do all things? In other words, he was able to if you look at it, it has nothing to do with football or soccer uh that people quote this verse. What does it say? I know how to both abound and to be abased. I know how to live with riches. I know how to live in poverty and be content either way. So when when we're looking at this as men with God's help and with God's strength, we can establish this at any time and any place in our home because God calls us to redeem that which is lost. We are to be his hands and feet towards redemption. All right, with that said, let's go to the scripture. So, as we looked at before, headship means the decision maker, husband and father can invalidate any decision his wife or daughter makes. Uh, and there's no also talked about this, there's no intermediate state between head the headship of a father and the headship of a husband. In America, we have this state. you you you turn 18, you don't got to listen to anybody anymore. Not if you're a Christian. Not if you're a Christian young lady, you're you're in that position of being under headship. A woman is always under headship unless she's a widow. Yeah. Deuteronomy 22:13, if any man take a wife. And so we're looking at this verse and it's strange and shocking. And we'll be looking at several passages that are strange and shocking to our Western um mind mind frame and our our Puritan heritage. So let's let's just bear with the Bible for a little bit. You're going to I was going to say bear with JD a little bit, but let's just I'll put it off on the Bible because wasn't my idea. Deuteronomy 22:13. If any man take a wife and go in unto her and hate her, and give occasions of speech against her, and bring up an evil name upon her, and say, I took this woman, and when I came to her, I found her not a maid or a virgin. Then shall the father of the damsel and her mother take and bring forth the token tokens of the damsel's virginity unto the elders of the city and the gate. And the damsel's father shall say unto the elders, I gave my daughter unto this man to wife, and he hateth her. And lo, he has given occasions of speech against her, saying, I found not thy daughter a maid. And yet these are the tokens of my daughter's virginity, and they shall spread the cloth before the elders of the city, and the elders that of that city shall take the man and chastise him. So you see what a serious accusation is. So in Israel, we're looking at this verse. We're going to look at another verse. In Israel, what was God trying to do and establish? He was trying to establish that being pure, being a virgin was of a high value. Amen. And an accusation. This woman's not a virgin. This was an accusation against the parents, right? Because it's their duty to bring that girl up in purity and to deliver her as a virgin to her husband, right? That's the duty. that that's the duty that's put upon the parents and so it's an important duty and God is looking at this whole picture and wants to emphasize how critical and important this uh purity and virginity is. So the elders of that city if if it's if the accusation basically if you want to look at it in a big picture they're they're the man is accusing the do the the girl and her parents of virginity fraud. You've committed fraud against me. You you said that this was a virgin daughter of Israel. She's not. You've lied to me. And here she makes the accusation. If there's proof, they put forth the proof. And what what happens is even the the the head men of the city, the city council of elders gets involved and they chastise him. You know what that means? They don't go, "You jerk." They beat him. He gets beaten in public in front of everyone. Amen. For making this accusation because it's such a serious one in in in our world, in our society. It hardly people hardly bat an eye at it. It's not that important. It's not significant. As Christians, this is the word. We look at this as a very critically important thing that we as fathers and as mothers have a duty to teach. And it's not just teaching and hoping, but it's verifying. It's watching the atmosphere. It's watching the type of friends and people that they're around. Right? Uh bad company corrupts good morals. We're watching for we're being watchful. We're being mindful. We're making sure that the atmosphere that our children are in is the right atmosphere. Right? Because the wrong atmosphere will produce the wrong results. the right atmosphere will produce the right right results. Amen. So, we're being watchful and mindful all of the all of this because we have a duty to produce children that are born again but that are pure. All right. And the elders of that city shall take that man and chastise him, and they shall immerse him in a hund shekels of silver, and give them unto the father of the damsel, because he's brought up an evil name upon a virgin of Israel, and she shall be his wife. He may not put her away all his days. I'm not really sure. I didn't I didn't do the research on what what amount a hundred shekels of silver would actually be. But if you begin to look at what some of these fines are in the Bible, they're very significant. They're not $5. They're not even a thousand dollars. They're tens of thousands of dollars in in in in modern money. And so these this is a very significant thing that she not only because he has brought an evil name upon a virgin of Israel and she shall be his wife, he may not put her away all his days. If you look at the Old Testament, there's other situations and circumstances where he could put her away, right? For the hardness of their hearts, Jesus said, "Moses gave you that authority." But from the beginning, it wasn't so. So in this case, because of that false accusation, every other reason is put away. He cannot divorce her. Not only that, but he has to pay a very significant fine to her father. Again, what is God pointing out? The responsibility of a father. The responsibility of a father. And if this evil accusation, the evil accusation is not just against the girl. It's against her father because you're accusing him of committing fraud. All right. So, the daughter is held uh I think I'm missing some verses here. Are they next? No. All right. So, let me just take that back. Um, okay. I have them here. Verse 20 says in Deuteronomy 22:20, "But if this thing be true, and the tokens of virginity be not found for the damsel, then they shall bring out the damsel to the door of her father's house, and the men of her city shall stone her with stones that she died because she has wrought folly in Israel to play the in her father's house. So shalt thou put evil away from among you." So you see there, the Lord holds the daughter guilty. She committed virginity fraud and she's guilty. She's literally put to death. But where is she put to death? At the door of her father's house. Why at the door of her father's house? Because her father didn't ensure the purity of his daughter. It's it's awful. It's horrible. But this is the horror. and wickedness of sin when a man would just imagine yourself in that position that you didn't deliver your daughter as a virgin. You failed to protect her. You failed to keep her in the right atmosphere. You failed to teach her. And here you you deliver her and she's guilty. What do you do? Your your precious daughter is brought to your door and they stone her with stones. And whose fault is that? Amen. It's it's your fault. It's her it's her guilt, but it's your fault for cause being the cause of it. So, how many knows what the three sacred virtues are? So, if you're if you're parents, you need to you need to get this written down. You need to get a good understanding of this because it's brother Brandham says it's what we need to be be teaching our families. Every every woman is given three sacred virtues. And it's again it's the duty of us as fathers and as mothers to deliver this teaching to our children so that they know do our daughters know what the s three sacred virtues are. Do they understand what their responsibility is before God? And this is from uh invisible union I believe. No, not invisible union. Choosing of a bride that brother Brandham talks about it. Three sacred virtues. One is your body. It's to keep your body pure. Two, it's your virtue. Speaks of strength. In other words, your ability to say yes or no. Three is your womanhood. your character and contact to your children and to your husband. These are the three sacred virtues that these are the things that God will hold. Brother Brandham says God will hold our sisters accountable, women accountable for how uh they handled these three things, these three sacred virtues. Let's keep going. Exodus 22:16. And if a man entice a maid that is not betrothed and lie with her, he shall surely endow her to be his wife. If her father utterly refused to give her unto him, he shall pay money according to the dowy of virgins. And so we see the Bible shows us fathers actually have genuine authority to make decisions for their daughter's marriage. Right? It it's not just a mock authority. It's not just a uh uh formality as we basically have it in our modern society. But in the Bible, the father can utterly refuse. So here we have a situation where a man entices a maid and he lies with her. He's under obligation. Now again the purpose of these laws is not necessarily the sense that um God wants to enact them right he wants to make these things difficult the purpose is there is a protection that he's putting there he's saying okay you want to become one flesh with some girl you're under obligation now you're obligated to provide for her. Now you're obligated to provide a home. Now you're obligated to provide for children if any children should come. You're under obligation before God to be a man of honor to take care of what you're you're doing. But the father still even in that situation he still has the right to say no I won't I won't give her to you. Of course, this would be a very very difficult thing for her in in the nation of Israel because of the value that they would place upon a virgin daughter. And so this is a very difficult thing. But I guess if the man is a son son of Bell, you probably wouldn't want to give him. And the evidence is probably pretty good that he is a son of bleial because he's defrauded physically defrauded your daughter without any commitment without taking asking authority to be joined in marriage from the father. And so what is what is his punishment? And you notice here is it's not execution. It's not a death sentence in this situation. But what it what is it? He shall pay the money according to the dowy of virgins. I was looking at this and the the amount could vary, but you could see it as anywhere between 30 and $50,000. So, it's a very significant amount of money that is placed upon this thing. This is this is a very very heavy fine. And and so whether he gets the girl or not to marry her, he has to pay it. Yeah. one way or the other. All right. And so as we looked, Time is short. I'm going to try to try to get through this. It's a good good place to finish if I can do it in five minutes. So once again, the Bible gives genuine authority to fathers to make decisions about the love life of their daughters. Right now, a wise father, of course, is going to have his daughter involved. It's not simply going to be an arranged marriage, though. There are places in the world where message believers certainly do it that way, and that's a normal thing. That's okay. In our culture, it's not done that way. And the Bible doesn't force us into that place. But the Bible does bring the principle of headship and decision making across the board. Yeah. And so, you know, if there's no if there's no leading of the Lord from your daughter, you're not going to force her into getting married to someone she doesn't like at all. Right? And so, as for as a young man, you're you're also not just out of nowhere now. It's like, hey, the pressure is off me. I can just go start asking all kinds of dads about this. I don't even have to talk to the girl anymore. As tempting as that as that is for some young men, probably would have been tempted uh for me that way. But as tempting is because as brother Brandham said, I don't like talking to a girl. I never did like talking to a girl when I was growing up. I was always afraid of them. Now I I got a house full of them. Guess the Lord was intent on delivering me of fear. So, but you know, you're you're you're making a con as a young man. Number one is you're ready to be a provider, right? Or you're in the process of preparation to be a provider. You're not 13 years old living at your mom and dad's house and playing video games in the dark, right? You're not ready to be a husband. You don't you don't have a job. You're not ready to provide. You can't get a home. You're you're not in that position. So, someone that is ready, you you you you you're meet a young lady, you're speaking to her, and you you think, "Maybe I have the leading of the Lord here. I'm going to pray." You seek the mind of the Lord in through this process. As a young lady, you're not out there throwing yourself in the message version of doing that before young men trying to get response from all of them. You're waiting on the Lord. You're trusting God for send to send you the right one in the right time. But as a young man, you look, you're discerning the the mind of the Lord. And none of these decisions should be made in a vacuum. You shouldn't make the decision on your own. You as a as a young man, you have parents, you have a pastor. Seek wisdom. In the multitude of counselors, there's safety. Seek wisdom. Am I ready? That's a question you should ask your your mom and dad. Not I like this girl. I want to talk to her. You need to be ready to because the purpose of courtship is what? Fun. That's a that's a a side thing. The purpose of courtship is discerning the will of the Lord for marriage, right? And so as a as a young lady, you're you you you get the question asked of you from your dad because a young man has approached your dad and you your dad should come to you come to you and you speak together about it and you pray and seek the mind of the Lord together about it. Do you want to take the next step? Do you want to go towards courtship? Do you want to discern the will of the Lord? She might say no way. Well, she's protected. She doesn't have to say no way. dad gets the wonderful opportunity to tell a young man, "No, no, I don't believe that's the will of the Lord." And so, you know, this this whole process is not to be made uh without advice, without wisdom from your pastor, your parents, and those that you trust. It's not a it's not a matter that we run into with our hormones ablaze, right? Of course, that's part of it. God designed us that way for a purpose. And yet, we do it the biblical way. We seek as young men, you seek counsel. You seek wisdom. You understand? Well, you go and talk to your dad. You're not ready. But dude, what are you talking about? Okay. So, what do I need to do, Dad? What steps do I need to take to make myself ready? Same thing, young lady. Maybe a boy approaches and dad has to right away say she she's not ready for that. You know, you you you need to understand first, do you have the Holy Ghost? Never should go into marriage in a position where you're not born born of the spirit of God. That's a disaster waiting to happen. And so, I'm going to have to close there. Let's stand and pray.
