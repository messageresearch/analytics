how you've given us your spirit to lead us lord you you're the master you're our leader we want to follow you lord we ask that your spirit would just continue to be in control of the service but i would just step out of the way and let you move and work in my heart and in every heart here and every heart listening lord we want you to come and do what only you can do to touch us father we ask these things in jesus name amen while we're standing let's just turn to luke 14 27. i'm entitling this one as your master even christ so luke 14 27 it's important for all of us not to get caught up in the normal routines of life and stop listening to that still small voice speaking to our hearts not just to be living in the natural realm and doing the normal things of every day of course we have to do that but there has to be something in our hearts that transcends that not just on sunday and wednesday but every single day every single moment and i believe we all i know myself we all need times to rededicate our hearts and minds to that simple truth that we are all to be led as individuals by christ there are some things like this that are so critical and key to the christian faith that without them you literally have nothing else and this is one of those things it's not a group walk it's not a church walk it's not a walk with your pastor it's a walk with you and christ alone there's only two people allowed in it only two people and whosoever does not bear his cross and come after me cannot be my disciple may the lord add the blessing to the reading of his word can be seated i just want to remind us all it's how important our personal relationship personal experience and individual walk with god is again it's not about a church it's not about a group it's not about a favorite minister or a group of ministers that we all think are associated together that we're following and take comfort that we're following it's about your heart and christ we gather as a troop as a church as a group made up of individuals who must be individually led by the spirit of god so that when we come together each part of the body functions properly each individual member of we are a part of a body we're a part of a group but it's a mystical body it transcends this these walls the structure that we have as with a pastor and and trustees and deacons it transcends all of that and it goes to each one of you as an individual if each one of you is an individual is not led by the spirit your and your your part of your if a part of your body is not connected to the head what is it its paralysis takes place so if you are not individually led by the spirit of god it's causing paralysis in the body for a body to function properly every individual has to be connected to the head personally by revelation through the baptism of the holy ghost matthew 23 verse 2 saying the scribes and pharisees sit in moses seat all therefore whatsoever they bid you observe that observe and do but do ye not after their works for they say and do not amen for they bind heavy burdens and grievous to be born and lay them on men's shoulders but they themselves will not move them with one of their fingers but all their works they do for to be seen of men now i i'm not up here to point fingers at who these pharisees are what i'm here to do is look at a motive of the heart but all their works they do why to be seen by those around them that's scary in other words they're in a group they're a part of a group and what they do they want to be seen by other people as what fitting into what that group does that's their mo that's the motive that they have of their heart they make broad their phylacteries they all they all do they're all making them broad and they're even in a competition to make make them broader and enlarge the borders of their garments and love the uppermost rooms at feast in other words and the chiefs in the synagogues they want to be honored they're looking to be honored they're looking to be served by other people and we're seven in gatherings in the markets and to be called of men rabbi rabbi but be not called rabbi for one is your master even christ and all ye are brethren we're all equal that's what that's saying all all these walls of differences and hierarchies all of that is torn down in jesus christ that's destroyed it's annihilated in christ outside of christ of course they still have that they continue that but truly for the true believer he knows that he has one master even christ and that all of you are brothers and sisters we're all equal we're all equally valuable did you hear that sisters young people you're all equally valuable do you have a different function than one another yeah sisters are not called to leadership positions in the local church or preaching positions in the local church but they're not called also not called to be spiritual weaklings amen they are this word brethren is a greek word that speaks of brothers and sisters it's the word delfoy which is neuter gender which means it's both men and women not just brothers as in the sense of male all of you are a delphi all of you are brothers and sisters we're all equally valuable there's no male or female in christ the female is not receiving her salvation in a subservient way through her husband male and female has done away with that doesn't mean roles and positions in the church and leadership is done away with as some take that but what it what it means is equal access same as jews and gentiles he says there's no difference between jews and gentiles that's a direct scriptural quote what and what does that mean there's no difference between ju we all have equal access what are gentiles gentiles is made up of every nation tongue and people group every color every tribe every language there's no difference between jews and gentiles all now have open and free access to christ and we can only come as individuals and where and again i want to emphasize on that sisters it's equal access your husband does not have more access to the spirit of god than you do he has a different position but you are called to not be a spiritual weakling but to be strong i think i did in a sunday school he said paul told the whole church quit you like men be men always writing to men and women well now he's not trying to confuse genders like we are today but what was he saying be strong be strong sisters he wants you to be strong he wants you to have a solid revelation and understanding of the truth of the bible he wants you to know how to communicate that to your children and to your sisters around you so that you can fellowship not just about what dress you're going to get that's fine but so you can fellowship around the word of god you're not lower than men that's a false teaching in a false doctrine you have a different position absolutely it doesn't make you lower doesn't make you have less access there's in christ there's neither male or female we have one master that's christ verse 9 and call no man your father upon the earth for one is your father which is in heaven neither be called masters for one is your master even christ but he that is greatest among you shall be your servant and whosoever shall exalt himself shall be abased and he that shall humble himself shall be exalted i'm going to be mentioning a couple times the chosen if you haven't seen it please see it but i think they did a brilliant job and i'm bringing this up here i understand the chosen is not scripture and there's things in it that are uh artistic license the the point i'm bringing up is everyone was taking turns to carry the carts as they're going from one place to another and jesus said oh it's my turn they're like no you don't do that oh no i like to do that some ways this uh manual labor is very simple uh and easy compared to what i'm doing right now and i thought this is marvelous that is the heart of a servant not to say i'm the messiah i'm the king of kings and lord of lords you shall you shall serve me and carry all the burden no he's out there he's ready to carry this cart he's down underneath working on someone's cart to help him that is the heart of christ to be a servant to do what you can to help people now it would not be a help to anyone for me to get under and start working on your vehicle but there's other things i can do to to to help you and be a blessing but what i'm saying is each of us has a different thing take what you have take what little thing you can do and use it to help other people to serve to say i didn't come to be served i came to serve verse 12 and whosoever shall exalt himself shall be abased and he that shall humble himself shall be exalted i've i don't want to call peop any names out but i've been to i've been to meetings and there the ministers are they're eating all the the best food and that's smoked on the smoker and it's the most wonderful thing and all the ministers there to just kick back enjoying these good things and everyone else is up eating the meager food at another place i thought my goodness that's not that's not the heart of of christ that i didn't i that broke my heart to think that you know the we as preachers should be more mature and up there serving the young people not beings not being served the the the steaks and the ribs and all this stuff while they're eating whatever it wasn't bad food they were eating but it was definitely lesser food and our heart should be different our heart should be one where we're ready to go wash people's feet now we do that as a symbol but in the in the day in the day of christ that was a real necessity and it was a job that someone took and christ went and did that and it was offensive to peter how will the king of kings and lord of lords bend down and be do the job of a slave because that is the way of god that is the heart of god christ was full filled with the heart of god whoever will exalt himself will be a base he'll be brought low and he that shall humble himself shall be exalted do you none of us should have it in our mind saying i want to be exalted right that's you're starting from the wrong motivation because the human nature when you say i want to be exalted you're going to do what you're not going to go and do the dirty thing you're not going to get involved with people that are unclean and i think sometimes we can have the approach in the message when we look and see that person doesn't fit the image and we just we we put a thing over her face and say unclean unclean we we laugh and it's funny but something's wrong in the in our heart when we take that approach and when we look at other people who are different than us and look down on them okay they've got spiked hair and it's a rainbow color but it's a soul it's a soul that's destroyed under the curse of satan in this day and our heart should not be looking down looking down our noses at people but we should be coming down on their level that's what christ did look at look at what he did in john 4 i must needs go by samaria it's astonishing it's an astonishing thing that he did that jews and samaritans hated each other the samaritans were the ten tribes the jews were the jews were the uh judah benjamin and some and levites and so they they looked down on these samaritans samaria was the capital city of the the northern kingdom right and so they had a different worship they had a different bible they had a different approach and the jews looked down on them and they looked down on at the on the jews they despised each other and jesus said none of your nonsense matters to me there's souls that need i must needs go by samaria and there was that woman at the well yeah no one wanted her no one not even other women wanted to be around her and here he was going after that one that one soul you know it let us have that heart now i i'm sorry if i spoil season two episode three for you but um it's on my heart and it's part of what a quote that i came across from the quote of the day today that blew me away last night um watching the episode most of it jesus was in the background he had a healing line and the disciples are there they're taking shifts to manage the crowd and keep control of them and so forth during this time the disgust the disciples were discussing themselves the kingdom how they fitted in that fit into that the destruction of rome and then as the day went on jesus is at the healing line morning until late late at night as the day went on peter and and peter becomes angry at matthew the tax collector you you never you never apologized you made me do things i never would have done and he was angry they were blowing up and there's a blow up andrew says he's right he's not not he's not very nice to you but he's right you you did wrong and you've never apologized to us then james and john having been already rebuked as the sons of thunder stand up and say you can't do that so they're ready to go to blows they're arguing and they're ready to go blows and everybody has a different perspective and everybody is right from their perspective but they're all arguing they're all fussing they're all fighting with each other and they're ready to have a fist fight with each other and out of the darkness comes jesus staggering walking after praying for hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of sick people all day and as he as he walks they see he's he's staggering he can barely stand up and he there's so complete silence and he looks at them says good night and goes directly to his tent and he's got blood on his face his feet hurt he's tired what was he doing he was healing the sick he was ministering to the broken he was delivering people that were captive and what were his disciples doing fighting each other and and with a trembling heart somehow i feel some of us even around the message movement have come to this place we're busy fighting one another while jesus is healing the sick saving the lost and delivering the brokenhearted our whole focus sometimes gets wrong gets off me too our focus gets to the wrong thing and looks at the wrong thing and our attitude gets wrong and we get bad feelings and funny feelings about one another when jesus is saying you're my body i want to use you to heal the sick deliver the brokenhearted and save the lost what are you doing what are we doing what am i doing in the sermon be not afraid brother branham says i've had ministers say to me you better go see him because he's an influen an influential man in the city i don't care if he's a bum in the street so so drunk he can't move he's just as much as a mayor of the city in the sight of god because it's whosoever will let him come but we went after somebody else that was a movie star had some great pole or some tap dance or a modern jitterbug or whatever you want to call it god goes to the gutters go out in the streets and the highways and compel them to come in and remember that was the last call the church has gone off listen the church has gone on without him see you've gone on off on tantrums and don't think just because we're fought we we confess to follow the messenger to this age that we can't do the same thing that we can't go off into tantrums go off in the wrong direction have the wrong attitude wrong approach because we all know we all know and know many examples of these things happening and i'm not saying you are this one is our church is this art i'm not making a broad statement i'm talking to you and to me as an individual because that's what goes off the wrong direction and in the wrong way is individuals do that and then we do it as a group in a man running from the presence of the lord brother branham says how wishy-washy that's what's too many christians today are so soft-soaked and everything until they think all they do is join a church go in somewhere put their name on a book or do a little something jump up and down shout or something like that and call it christianity christianity is an everyday rugged life living for god in this in this present world it's a constant burning of the fire and love of god in the heart that sets you a fire and puts you out yonder with the people and making converts to christ responsibilities but it's easy to go the way the world goes it's easy to flow down the stream now i don't want you to push this off on somebody else when you say it's easy to go the way the world goes you can say well i'm not of this world think about it this way what is he talking about wishy-washy christians so that's the world that he's talking about don't put it don't even put it off that's just denominations because the spirit of denomination it starts out what as a deed it doesn't start out as a doctrine it starts out as a deed they haven't formalized it they just have the spirit of what that doctrine formally becomes so it's a it's a deed what is it it's a spirit we understand that by looking at the four horsemen four horse riders we understand it's a spirit and it looks so close to being right and and you're he says go out there and brother branham says it's easy to flow down the stream so there's the picture i see is there's a there's a stream going this way this is the easy message way to go down you fit in you look the part everything's nice everything's good and you're flowing down the stream it's easy go out there and set down in the river with your boat you get your oars and start pulling up against the current you don't make much time and it goes hard but you just want let once let loose the oars and watch how fast you pass the trees going down but look where you're going when things are floating easy remember you're going towards a great cataract down there of some sort you're going towards the falls and it won't be long you'll be going over that falls just floating with the world easy the way it goes you don't want that no sir but you must accept your responsibility now you believe it and you think it's the truth and the responsibility that god has given us in this day to bring this message and as i get older and i know my days are shortening up i feel the responsibility greater than i ever felt pressing on we must do it we must get down to it and everywhere we go and tell the message and tell the people that jesus christ is coming that he's god and he's coming soon there's not a hope left in the world but the coming of the lord amen so that's a responsibility that we have to make converts to christ to share the message wherever we go that's our responsibility and the way the way of the world is the easy way the wishy-washy way it's not sharing the message it's not being salt and light it's being weak it's trying to fit in but god's way is that rugged every day living for god it's a constant burning of the fire and love of god in the heart and you don't get that from a church walk you don't get that from being a groupie you get that from being individually connected to jesus christ we can we can get caught in that flow there's a flow and you get caught up in it into that flow and that flow can take you in the completely wrong direction we want to be sure that we're rowing with christ that we're going the direction that christ is going i brought two quotes there our responsibility is to share the message to make converts to christ the other the other quote what did it say god goes to the gutters not the popular places the easy places the people that smell right but the people that are lost that are broken what did christ go to the people that are lost that are broken people that are healthy they don't they don't need a physician the sick need a physician you are the body of christ the sick need a physician who is the physician you you are the physician christ in you the hope of glory so healing deliverance from from sin all these things come by the spirit of god sending you to someone who's broken amen who's hurt not just to anyone remember christ went to the pool of bethesda he didn't just blanket heal everyone he was led of his father directly to that one and he spoke the word to that one and that that's what came you as an individual have a mission given to you as an individual by god and he wants you to be connected directly to him to accomplish that mission every member of the body of christ every person that is filled with the spirit of god has a purpose and must be led by god in that purpose see i don't know exactly what my purpose is he made you it's not complicated he made you the way you are he prepared you look at the apostle paul now god could have made apostle paul like john the baptist a person that was completely outside of education outside of greek culture he could have sent him from a young age to the wilderness trained him up and he would have walked right in to the to christ and being a preacher of the gospel but god made it completely different he made him a religious fanatic pharisee he made him born in the city of tarsus to learn greek and no have a greek background he went and learned in a theological seminary and then he got called knocked off his high horse sent to the wilderness to have all of that beaten out of him and yet all of it was still there it didn't like he forgot the education that he had or he forgot about jewish traditions and customs he just took that all of that is done in comparison to the knowledge of christ in other words god took a man molded him from the time he was a little boy sent him through greek education jewish education allowed him to be a man fighting against jesus christ and then came and knocked him out of the horse and knocked him off his horse and brought him to the place where he used all of those experiences that led up to that point in subservience to christ alone think about that for a second he god didn't it wasn't men in black god didn't erase take a little thing and erase the memory of paul it's not what he did he took paul and he brought him to the place where everything was surrendered to christ everything was the education the background all of it meant nothing to him in comparison with the value of jesus christ so what's my point he made you he brought you through life experiences he's and all of that is training and purpose for god to use you for his purpose whatever that might be amen the things that you have a bent towards that you have a desire for what is it supposed to be used for get rid of your thinking and let christ use you in that thing that you're gifted at john 21 20 through 22. then peter turning about sees the disciple whom jesus loved following which also leaned on his breast at supper and said lord which is he that betrayeth thee peter seeing him sayeth to jesus lord and what shall this man do so here peter sees john coming by after this conversation do you love me you know i love you back and forth feed my sheep then here we come what about any he's told basically told peter you're going to be taken and executed at the end of your life right and so peter says tell john's future too tell me what's going to happen to him if i will that he tarries till i come what is that to thee follow thou me what's john going to do what's his life going to consist of what does that do follow me well what if what if brother matt does this what is that to you follow me that's an individual call to peter peter is not to respond to john's purpose john's call or any of the other disciples he is to follow directly the leadership of christ we have one master even christ in the sermon divine healing in 1954 brother branham says one of the biggest failures in the world is the church that's right churches has miserably failed everything has failed but we receive a kingdom which cannot fail jesus christ it cannot fail and we're so happy for that that it's not a church affair it's an individual affair it's not whether my church is saved it's whether i am saved it isn't whether my deacon is saved or my pastor is saved or my mother is saved it's whether i am saved or not myself i must be saved then i must tell them and then if they're saved wonderful if they're not i must still remain saved amen that's i must obtain my salvation oh what a wonderful day amen romans 8 14 for many as are led by the spirit of god they are the sons of god every individual in the body of christ must be led by the spirit of god god wants and demands that our hearts alone belong to him we cannot be caught in the web of the influence of what everybody else is doing we have to be caught in the web of the leadership of christ we have to be in that reality not in the reality well i'm just doing what everybody else around me does no we're not we're not to do that we're to be led and molded personally by christ i mean obviously we understand god uses the five-fold ministry he uses pastors he he he works through them but they're not your master they are there for your edification for your personal building up so that your individual walk with christ can flourish that's the purpose of it they're not to be your holy ghost they're not to be your leader you have to be led you can go for advice you can go for asking questions but at the end of the day you can't just act upon someone's advice you have to pray and ask god to lead you as an individual we can't be in this position where we look around and we take a look at the people around us and say oh good i'm sure i'm being led by god now because everybody around me is just right my pastor is the right one and that doesn't mean anything it's important to have a good pastor it's important to have a good bible teaching ministry at your church it's imp it's important to have a spirit-filled worship team but what if you have none of that what if you're way off in some beaten path and you got somebody that you know they love the lord they're not very good preacher and you got a song leader and they're real bad now you can't go to heaven it's ridiculous but people approach it that way i've got to move to this church and then i'll be okay no no you can still be lost and go to hell judas had the best pastor ever and he had a great church that he was a part of but it didn't mean that he went to heaven and and so that's why we have to have our individual bond with jesus christ be at our complete absolute that has to be our absolute not our church and of course we can all say amen to that but really in your approach in your heart you have to live that because we can all say amen to that and then go say i sure am glad i'm at this church and this person's the pastor oh i just feel real satisfied okay i mean i'm i'm glad i'm here too that don't mean i'm going to heaven that don't mean i have the leadership of the holy ghost in my life that just means i'm at a good church on the day of pentecost the disciples each as individuals and then the the uh the pillar of fire broke apart they didn't all receive the pillar of fire and they were just joined at the hip one you know they broke apart as cloven tongues and they came into them as individuals they as individuals received the spirit of god and had an individual experience with christ that no one else could take away from them without that we have we haven't experienced salvation without that we can't be led by the spirit of god i love i love the apostle paul i think he's such an example you know you look at how how he handled things and dealt with things and it just amazes me but even you even look in galatians chapter 2 verse 11 through 14 peter's coming for a little fellowship to antioch but when peter was come to antioch i was stood him to the face because he was to be blamed for before that certain came from james he did eat with the gentiles but when they were with come he withdrew and separated himself fearing them which were of the circumcision and the other jews dissembled likewise with them in so much that barnabas also was carried away with their dissimulation but when i saw that they walked not uprightly according to the truth of the gospel i said unto peter before them all if thou being a jew livest after the manner of the gentiles and not as do the jews why compel us thou the gentiles to live as do the jews he rebuked him in front of everyone what happened peter was scared of a group of people and he submitted his heart to this group in this situation before he submitted his heart to christ peter we understand peter was filled with the holy ghost he was the apostle of the jews he he under inspiration he wrote scripture he was the preacher on the day of pentecost to explain what was happening and yet he was carried away with my group is going to look down on me if i do this my group of preacher friends will kick me out and paul said i could care less about your groups of preacher friends i want to be true to christ no matter how they look at me no matter what they think of me i want to be obedient to him it's not about preacher groups every preacher has to be led by the spirit of god and if he's not he's doing what peter did at the very best he's doing what peter did which was making a grave mistake which he needed to needs to repent of and which i know i'm sure he did repent of in the sermon a hidden life 1955 brother branham says as our differences of life and fussing and quarreling amongst one another is the reason the veil can't drop behind us and we ca we can we can go into the presence into that presence of god that's right we're so interested in our denominations we're so interested in what the next fellow what what is that to thee follow thou me it's an individual affair between every minister how a minister ought to always get alone to himself even before he preaches before he prays before he does anything he should get alone with god in that quiet place hid away with god in the sermon abraham 1956 next thing what taken place there was lot when god said said separate yourself from everybody the walk with christ is an individual walk you walk you stand alone with you and god alone not you and the pastor you and god alone not you and the deacon sometimes you and your wife you and your husband but you and god alone you stand alone on your convictions salvation is not a church affair it's an individual affair in 58 the sudden secret going away of the church not only that but what a what if i would speak of the time of little stephen not a prophet not a pastor just a member of the body of christ how that this little fellow stood before the sanhedrin council that morning and spoke out to those who were condemning him and said you stiff necks uncircumcising hearts and ears you'd always resist the holy ghost as your fathers did so do you he wasn't a pastor you can't expect your pastor to do it all you can't expect your trustee board to do it all or your deacon board you've got to make ready make yourself ready it's an individual affair amen in what house will you build me 1965 we must look to the leading of the holy spirit but one thing that troubled me in coming here and to telling people well you should not come or you should come brother bran was talking about tucson he's telling he's people are saying should i move out there that's the one thing that troubled me in coming here into telling people well you should not come or you should come that i leave up to each individual the way that god leads that individual to do i think every one of us should do that be led by the spirit on what to do perfect faith 1963 that's the way it is to all believers they're a mystic the people don't understand because they live in a world to themselves jesus lived in a world that nobody else could touch the type disciples couldn't understand him he spoke to them they say this and then they said what you talking riddles we don't understand this how can this be see they wasn't in the world that he lived in see they couldn't understand him nobody could understand him and so when a man lives by faith and walks by faith i mean substance faith he is isolated from the entire world and becomes a new creature in christ there now you're getting to bride material see you're getting into rapturing condition now that means for each one of us not just the pastor deacons trustees that means for the laity every individual walks in a world with god alone you're baptized into this kingdom and there's nobody in there but you and god see he gives the orders and you pack them out whatever he says there's not a shadow of doubt nowhere you walk right on if the lord says this there's nobody in the world can talk you out of it you go right on just the same now you're coming into perfect faith perfect perfection that cannot fail that faith never fails yes he was a mystic to them with his perfect faith and so is it now with those who have perfect faith are a mystic to others amen what is he saying there you're a mystic in other words what why are you doing that that's that makes no sense the lord is speaking to my heart and i'm being obedient to him well you could go and you could have these big huge meetings and you'd attract all the people no i want to go and talk to one samaritan woman and then she'll talk to everybody and they'll come to me that don't make any sense to the world but god can god can lead us in very strange and different ways that the world doesn't understand and we have to be ready to act on the way we're not purposely making crazy decisions no this don't try to mimic this if you mimic it you'll destroy your life this isn't something that can be mimicked by human understanding this is a relationship that you have and sometimes he says nothing and you sit still and sometimes he speaks and you go do something and it makes no sense to anybody but but you know and you understand why he told you and the purpose behind it galatians 1 1 i read these verses and though it's paul speaking i just feel it resonating in my heart when i read it not that i look at myself as some apostle that's not the part about i'm looking at but paul an apostle not of men that part not of men neither by man but by jesus christ and god the father who raised him from the dead that's not just for paul the apostle it's for every son and daughter of god you can say tony son of god not of men neither by man but by jesus christ and god the father who's quickened me from the dead each of us have to have that testimony god raised me up it's god's purpose that he's called me i had someone on youtube comments last night say are you are you for brother joseph or are you against brother joseph and i said well brother i was called of god to the ministry not by any man and therefore it matters very little what other people are doing and neither does neither does that affect my calling it doesn't matter brother joseph is this brother joseph is that he's doing this wrong he's doing this right what is that to thee follow thou me now people people are carried away sometimes into false teachings and false doctrines and and of course we have to to to clarify things and take a stand but we do it in love we do it in kindness but if i'm for or against a person goodness i'm for everybody but as far as a certain ministry and following a certain ministry after the messenger this age not really into that we're supposed to be faithful to what the messenger taught not to our own thinking or some other one of our favorite preachers we're supposed to be led of the lord we have all kinds of wonderful preachers wonderful ministers that do so much good and people get delivered and healed and and and so forth but we're not we're we're not of them we have one master even christ let me skip ahead from the ephesian church age the church age book brother branham talking about the first messenger paul founded the church at ephesus about the middle of the first century and he talks about the beginning of that and he says his mannest manner of ministering set the pattern that all future messengers were to aspire to and actually sets the pattern for every true minister of god though he would not attain to such heights in the prophetic realm as paul did so he goes on to say paul's ministry at a three-fold quality i'll just briefly read those paul was first of all paul was absolutely true to the word he never deviated it from it no matter what the cost no matter what the cost notice that paul was unorganized but spirit-led as when god moved upon moses to lead israel out of egypt jerusalem's council never sent paul out nor did it have any power or jurisdiction over him god and god alone did the sending and the leading secondly his ministry was in the power of the spirit thereby demonstrating the spoken and written word thirdly he had the evident fruit of his god-given ministry now i want to look at the heart of paul and galatians 1 11. and we'll read gonna read extensively and that'll be the where i close but i certify you brethren and don't just take this as well it's for ministers because it's for all of us on our every one of us on our own level but i certify you brethren that the gospel which was preached of me is not after man for i neither received it of man neither was i taught it but by the revelation of jesus christ for us god used a man to deliver it to us but it has to transcend that and it has to be a personal revelation to our heart now god uses men to bring that for for the body of christ he brought it through brother branham he brings it through the five-fold ministry but yet it has to be a spiritual happening in your soul it can't merely just be knowledge it has to be by the revelation of jesus christ to you personally verse 13 for you i've heard of my conversation in time past in the jews religion how that beyond measure i persecuted the church of god and wasted it and profited in the jews religion above many my equals in my own nation being more exceedingly zealous of the traditions of my fathers but when it pleased god look at this the man who was wasting and persecuting the church of god still could say but when it pleased god who separated me from my mother's womb the chiefest of sinners still said he separated me from my mother's womb and called me by his grace you might have gone through all kinds of problems troubles difficulties you might look like the least one that's qualified to do what god has called you to do and yet god separated you from his mother's womb to fulfill the purpose that he has for you in your life in his in his life in you which is what to reveal his son in me it's not just for paul that's that's every believer is to have the son of god revealed through them that i might preach him among the heathen immediately i conferred not with flesh and blood interesting and yet god did send someone to him to pray for him right and baptize him but yet that vision and that revelation that paul had he didn't say hey i need to check this out he went forward he went forward in what god called him to do neither went i up to jerusalem to them which were apostles before me but i went up went into arabia and returned again unto damascus then after three years i went up to jerusalem to see peter and abode with him 15 days but of other of the apostles saw i none save james the lord's brother and now the things which i write unto you behold before god i lie not afterwards i came into the regions of syria and cilicia and was unknown by faith under the churches of judea which were in christ but they had heard only that he which persecuted us in times past now preaches the faith which once he destroyed and they glorified god in me then 14 years later musicians if you'd come then 14 years later after i went up again to jerusalem with barnabas and took titus with me also and i went up by revelation amen god revealed paul go up go up go do that isn't it interesting when paul was received that revelation everybody came and said the holy spirit says bonds and affliction await you in jerusalem he says why are you breaking my heart i don't this is this doesn't mean anything to me i'm willing to die for the sake of the gospel of jesus christ so he went up by revelation and the holy spirit is warning him and telling him in every place bonds and affliction await you isn't that interesting how the lord deals was that a test for paul saying well you could deliver yourself there's a whole lot of places you can go besides jerusalem and paul says i was revealed to me personally what these other people are saying i love them they don't want me to go they don't want to be me to be harmed but i need to follow christ no matter the cost and i went up by revelation and communicated unto them that gospel which i preach among the gentiles but privately to them which were of reputation lest by any means i should run or had run in vain but neither titus who was with me being a greek was compelled to be circumcised and that because of false brethren unawares brought in who came in privily to spy out our liberty which we have in christ jesus that they might bring us on into bondage look at here these are people that are in the church in jerusalem you have apostles and paul says you also have false brethren in the church who are trying and pushing for the gentiles to be under the law of moses and he says to whom we gave place by subjection no not for an hour look at the stand that he takes regardless regardless of the cost that the truth of the gospel might continue with you but of those who seem to be somewhat i love this whatsoever they were it makes no matter to me those who appeared to be important [Music] whatever they were it didn't matter to me god accepts no man's person god does not play favorites that way it doesn't matter they're popular they're the big shots they're in power paul says it makes no difference to me that is the heart that was the heart that brother branham had they said you should go see the important man of the city he said god goes to the gutter he looks deals with the man that's drunk on the street the same way he would deal with the man that's the mayor of the city for they who seem to be somewhat in conference added nothing to me but contrary wise when they saw that the gospel of the uncircumcision was committed unto me as the gospel of the circumcision wasn't to peter for he that wrought effectually in peter to the apostleship of the circumcision the same was mighty in me for the gentiles and when james cephas and john who seemed to be pillars perceived the grace that was given unto me they gave to me and barnabas the right hands of fellowship that we should go unto the heathen and they into the circumcision only they would that we should remember the poor the same which i also was forward to do the heart of paul following the leadership of the holy ghost no matter what it's an individual affair that's not just for paul you say well he was the messenger to the age he had something different he had something uh set apart from what i have well of course of course and yet his life he says follow me as i follow christ in other words he was an example to us to see and say this is how we can as individuals walk with christ we have this we have the same access that paul has different gifts different place in the body of christ but we have the same spirit of god dwelling in us we have the same god that wants to speak with us and lead us as individuals don't get caught aside into a church walk [Music] get further get deeper into christ be led by the spirit young people it's an individual walk between you and christ not you and your parents in christ yes of course there's relationships we all have human relationships and god governs those human relationships according to his commandments and yet you're not going to be saved through your parent you're going to be saved through god coming to you directly as an individual regardless of what your parents do now or in the future it's you and your heart and christ let's stand and pray heavenly father we love you we worship you lord we ask that your spirit would come and just move upon our hearts lord [Music] that you would guide us and you to teach us lord and that you would you would deal with us lord we what a precious thing it is for each of us that that
