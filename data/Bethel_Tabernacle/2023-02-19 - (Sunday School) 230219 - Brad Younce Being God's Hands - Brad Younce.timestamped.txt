[0:00] this morning
[0:01] and he's happy to be in the house of the
[0:04] Lord
[0:07] not necessarily come to hear
[0:09] me or
[0:10] any brother but we couldn't expect to
[0:12] hear from the Lord this morning
[0:15] let's all uh let's all stand
[0:19] have a word of Prayer
[0:22] father we just thank you for this time
[0:24] we have to come together once again Lord
[0:26] not knowing how many more times we'll
[0:28] have this opportunity
[0:30] but God may we take full advantage of it
[0:33] Lord may you just come down in this
[0:35] little lesson this morning and father
[0:37] and may you anoint my lips anoint her
[0:39] ears father give us stuff for our
[0:41] strength for our journey Lord we'll
[0:43] place it in your hands in Jesus name
[0:45] amen
[0:47] if you have your Bibles I'll read First
[0:49] Corinthians 29 chapter chapter 29 verse
[0:53] 10 through 12.
[1:00] should have it on the screen
[1:03] wherefore David blessed the Lord before
[1:06] all the congregation and David said
[1:08] blessed be thou Lord God of Israel Our
[1:11] Father forever and ever
[1:12] thine O Lord is the greatness and the
[1:15] power and the glory and the Victory and
[1:18] the Majesty for all that is in the
[1:20] heaven and in Earth is thine thine is
[1:23] the kingdom of Lord and thou are exalted
[1:25] as head above all
[1:27] both riches and honor
[1:29] come of thee and thou reignest over all
[1:32] and in thine hand is power
[1:35] get that in thy hand is power
[1:37] and might and in thine hand is to make
[1:40] great and to give strength unto all
[1:43] and in Philippians 4 13 He says Paul
[1:46] says I can do all things through Christ
[1:48] which strengthen me
[1:51] may God bless the Lord you have your
[1:52] seats
[1:56] put a title to this
[1:58] I was was put in be in God's hands
[2:02] hands signify power
[2:05] signifies Authority because we know when
[2:07] Jesus died
[2:09] he arose up and extended into the right
[2:11] hand of God
[2:12] not that he is on the right hand of God
[2:15] but he set it up as the authority he had
[2:18] the power so Jesus standing on the right
[2:20] hand of God he has all power
[2:23] all because of what he had done he had
[2:25] came on the earth he had died he
[2:27] accomplished what he came for
[2:29] here roses sent it up and came back down
[2:31] and then he appeared to disciples
[2:34] because Jesus said told right before he
[2:36] extended back up he says I've been up
[2:39] there I've come back now all power
[2:42] belongs to me he's I have all power of
[2:45] all Heaven a power of all Earth is on me
[2:48] he didn't get less power
[2:49] he got more power
[2:51] so what happened when he got God's power
[2:53] did God lose his power
[2:56] God didn't lose no power because there's
[2:58] not three Gods all that God was he
[3:01] poured into Christ and all that Christ
[3:03] was he poured into the church so what
[3:05] what that gives us today we got more
[3:07] power
[3:09] we have all the power because in Matthew
[3:11] 28 18 Jesus said unto them
[3:14] saying all
[3:16] power
[3:18] everything
[3:20] everything is given unto me in heaven
[3:22] and earth so what are you going to do
[3:25] he says I've got the power so I'm going
[3:27] to give it to you so go ye therefore to
[3:29] all the world
[3:31] be baptizing teach All Nations baptizing
[3:34] them in the name of the father and the
[3:36] son of the Holy Ghost go ye and taught
[3:38] the world and preach the gospel he's
[3:39] telling them
[3:40] teaching them to observe all things of
[3:44] whatsoever I have commanded you he said
[3:47] I have told you so what this is what
[3:48] you're going to do Lo I'm with you alway
[3:52] even unto the end of the world
[3:55] Jesus took all of God's power
[3:59] and gave it to you that's what happens
[4:01] when you come back on the day of
[4:03] Pentecost
[4:04] all that God was he poured into Christ
[4:06] like I said many God all that Christ was
[4:08] important to the church
[4:09] that means you have all the power
[4:12] so the power has been transferred to you
[4:15] God in you
[4:17] now it's when you say I can do all
[4:19] things through Christ who strengthened
[4:21] me
[4:22] now these hands are going to take these
[4:24] hands are going to do what you tell them
[4:25] to do if you don't tell them do nothing
[4:27] he's just gonna be she's going to sit
[4:28] here
[4:29] but if you take your hand says pick up
[4:31] that fork and dig in that plate and take
[4:33] a bite that's what your hands are going
[4:35] to do scratch your head your hand's
[4:38] going to do it whatever these you have
[4:40] power over your hands so what are you
[4:42] going to say to your hands today
[4:46] no you get on your phone
[4:49] play games why you got a game controller
[4:51] what's in your hands
[4:53] these hands were once used for the
[4:55] devil's work
[4:57] they used to smoke you tell it Go didn't
[5:00] grab your cigarette smoke grab you a
[5:02] drink take you a little drink
[5:04] whatever whatever the devil told us to
[5:06] do with our hands is what we did with it
[5:07] but now they're used for God God says I
[5:10] Want You To Worship me we rate we say
[5:13] hands you're going to raise up
[5:15] you're going to worship God
[5:17] we're being God's hands
[5:20] you get excited you want to clap your
[5:21] hands take your hands that's what God is
[5:24] using your hands whatever is in your
[5:25] hands God's going to use it
[5:28] Hallelujah if we completely surrender to
[5:31] God he can use our hands
[5:33] to lay them on the sick and cast out
[5:36] devils
[5:37] your hands is God's hands
[5:40] but we have to Humble ourselves
[5:42] therefore the my under the mighty hand
[5:45] of God that he may exalt you in due time
[5:49] but we try to do too many things our way
[5:51] we try to use our own hands to
[5:53] accomplish things we try to use our own
[5:56] intellect to get things accomplished
[5:59] but he can't use us until we realize
[6:02] we're nothing but Ralph says in Wild
[6:05] little Bethlehem God don't do it that
[6:07] way he takes something that's nothing so
[6:10] that he can show himself to be Mighty
[6:12] that he can
[6:14] if he had took a high priest or a
[6:16] well-trained man in the days when he was
[6:18] calling the apostles if he took debt
[6:21] instead of the ignorant unlearned
[6:22] fisherman who couldn't even write his
[6:24] own name
[6:25] they could have said oh that you see
[6:27] your education paid off but God took a
[6:30] man who couldn't even write his name
[6:33] and that he could take something that he
[6:35] could get into his hand
[6:37] something that he could make something
[6:39] out of to show that he's God
[6:41] would he get to a place that we realized
[6:44] that we're nothing
[6:45] they then get in God's hands and he can
[6:49] mold you and make you the way he wants
[6:52] you to be
[6:53] but as long as we go around and feel
[6:55] like we're important
[6:57] then you'll never get nowhere
[6:59] you can't even get in the hands of God
[7:02] Until you realize you're not important
[7:05] let's realize that this morning we're
[7:07] not important
[7:09] but we have the power in our hands
[7:11] so what power do you have
[7:14] is it your own power
[7:16] I don't want my own power my own power
[7:18] ain't gonna do nothing
[7:20] under my own power I can't speak
[7:22] I can't speak sickness to go away on
[7:25] people I can't cast out Devils my own
[7:26] power
[7:27] without without him I am nothing
[7:31] but in that it's in thy hand you have a
[7:32] choice of what you want to do
[7:35] you have life or death being presented
[7:37] to you it's what you choose
[7:40] God is just requiring a complete
[7:42] surrender to him
[7:44] you can't be in the world and God
[7:46] you can't have both
[7:48] right it's what's in your hands that
[7:50] gives you power
[7:51] what's in your hand
[7:54] if you want God to use what's in your
[7:56] hands what's in there
[7:58] is it your phone
[8:00] or some kind of game controller
[8:03] can God use that
[8:06] what's in your hand
[8:08] what was in the hands of Moses
[8:10] it was a stick most people just all they
[8:13] see was a stick
[8:14] Moses come up to the burning bush
[8:17] Moses like I can't do nothing God
[8:19] finally got you there after 40 years
[8:22] finally got you because 40 years before
[8:24] that he had tried to do it on his own
[8:27] he tried to he tried he took his matters
[8:29] into his own hands he was going to
[8:31] conquer Egypt it didn't work
[8:33] but when he got in front of the burning
[8:34] bush God said what's in your hand I'm
[8:36] going to use what you got Mo said that's
[8:38] just a stick he said throw it on the
[8:40] ground
[8:41] it turned to a snake he just picks it up
[8:44] and turns to a rod God says now you're
[8:46] ready go conquer Egypt
[8:49] that was what Moses had in his hand
[8:51] guard what do you have in his
[8:54] he had an ox goat it was used for
[8:56] prodding cattle
[8:57] as I was used for under under shamgar
[9:00] the man
[9:02] he would prod cattle
[9:04] Glory
[9:05] try not to get too excited here bro
[9:07] Jason told me to teach by the letter
[9:11] he said teach Let it Fly
[9:14] so I'm trying not to
[9:16] I'm gonna let him do the preaching but
[9:19] under just sham guard it was just an ox
[9:21] gold
[9:22] well he got tired of 600 flips got tired
[9:24] of listing stealing his food every year
[9:27] he said I've got to do something's got
[9:28] to happen so I'm going to place this
[9:30] I'll go into the hands of God and see
[9:33] what God will do with it what happened
[9:35] when when that father he said I can't
[9:37] take it no more I can't do I can't do
[9:39] nothing I can't do nothing on my own to
[9:40] fight these Philistines but God's power
[9:42] come in him and he slayed 600 600 of
[9:45] them
[9:47] what about Samson
[9:49] he took it to Samson he just had a
[9:51] Jawbone
[9:52] we know what happened he was hit a
[9:54] thousand Philistines upon him
[9:56] and he just looks over and sees a
[9:57] Jawbone laying on the ground
[9:59] a normal Jawbone you couldn't whoops a
[10:01] thousand people you hit you'd hit across
[10:03] a soldier's helmet one time it is
[10:05] shattered
[10:07] yeah brother ramp said there was a
[10:08] thousand of them
[10:10] Samson was just a little bitty little
[10:12] thing but the spirit of the Lord
[10:14] is what was big God always takes the
[10:18] foolishness
[10:20] he takes the foolishness of preaching
[10:23] that's what we do brother Caleb every
[10:24] time we get up here we're a bunch of
[10:25] fools
[10:27] we're fools for Christ
[10:29] he takes the foolishness of preaching
[10:32] what we're used by God
[10:36] remember to say God always takes the
[10:37] foolish and the ignorant things like
[10:39] that to do his work you see he takes
[10:42] something that's nothing
[10:44] all at once Here Comes those Philistines
[10:47] and surrounding him to kill him he took
[10:49] the Jawbone of a mule that was laying
[10:51] there
[10:53] picked up the Jawbone of that mule and
[10:55] the spirit of the Lord came upon him
[10:58] what's in your hand Samson
[11:01] at first he looked like an old Jawbone
[11:03] laying there
[11:04] the first lick he would have hit it with
[11:05] a burst into a thousand pieces over top
[11:07] of one of those helmets
[11:09] when a thousand rushed upon him and he
[11:11] beat every one of them to death
[11:15] that was when the spirit of God Came
[11:16] Upon him
[11:18] I like this next statement
[11:21] it popped out at me
[11:23] he said if we could only be jawbones in
[11:27] the hand of God
[11:28] [Music]
[11:31] what could God do with us if he could
[11:34] just get us in his hands
[11:35] let our hands be his hands what would
[11:39] happen
[11:40] Lord let me David with a sling
[11:45] just a slinging day of his hand he just
[11:46] had to protect sheep
[11:48] when animals come and tactic he just
[11:49] picked up a stone he would kill kill the
[11:51] animals
[11:52] but what happened when he got into the
[11:54] hands of God
[11:55] a big Philistine devil said it up there
[11:57] cursing God in Israel
[12:00] they said I can't take this
[12:02] her brother Ram said and Witnesses he
[12:04] got the thing to working right
[12:07] he got it going around and around
[12:10] but David had something to do
[12:14] all he had to do was just get it started
[12:17] God would do the rest
[12:19] that's what we had to do we got to get
[12:21] it started
[12:22] if you need healing get it started
[12:26] if you need Deliverance get it started
[12:30] just get it started let God do the rest
[12:33] there's power in your hand to defeat the
[12:35] Devil
[12:36] Robert said when you get to Faith in
[12:38] Jesus Christ Working In Perpetual
[12:40] perpetual motion in your soul something
[12:43] is going to take place
[12:46] sin and sickness will get away from you
[12:49] Devils will scatter like Roaches on a
[12:52] floor
[12:54] wow
[12:55] Devils will scatter like Roaches on the
[12:58] floor in the summertime when the light
[13:00] is turned on
[13:03] Hallelujah
[13:05] so here you come
[13:07] he says I'll meet you in the name of the
[13:10] Lord God of Israel and he begin to swing
[13:12] that slingshot around and the Holy Ghost
[13:15] shot that rock right up
[13:17] that Philistine and killed him
[13:19] David took his own sword and cut his
[13:22] head off
[13:24] took Goliath's so on sword and cut his
[13:27] head off
[13:31] and then he held it up
[13:34] and then he says come on boys
[13:38] Hallelujah he says come on all we got to
[13:42] do is get it started
[13:44] and let God do it
[13:46] come on boys he said

[14:10] Victory Is Ours
[14:13] how many wants victory
[14:16] what's in your hand

[14:23] just give it to God
[14:25] just let God
[14:27] let go and let God
[14:31] I always wonder about that statement
[14:33] just let go let God
[14:35] it's easy
[14:39] and not really it's not really easy
[14:43] what happened when Jesus had five
[14:45] thousand to feed
[14:46] he said feed these people so he ain't
[14:48] got nothing but a few little fishes and
[14:50] a few little loaves
[14:52] that might have fed
[14:54] brother Chris it might just fed me I
[14:57] might have shared with you
[14:59] but when God got a hold of it
[15:02] it fed 5 000 people and then had 12
[15:04] basketballs left over
[15:07] power
[15:09] that's what's in God Jesus is saying you
[15:11] have power
[15:12] you have the Holy Ghost
[15:14] it gets all over you

[15:29] walk
[15:30] he had a power from somewhere
[15:32] was he he's be he was beating God's
[15:34] hands
[15:36] Hallelujah
[15:38] you lay hands on the sick and they shall
[15:40] recover

[15:50] what happens when the brothers come up
[15:51] here and we all laid our hands up on top
[15:54] of one another it was God's hands
[15:57] praying over those cloths
[15:59] when you come up here you get prayed for
[16:00] no matter who it is
[16:03] as soon as that man lays hands on you
[16:05] it's God laying hands on you
[16:08] if we just get the faith

[16:13] received it because I know God's hands
[16:14] is on me
[16:16] God is praying for me not just a man
[16:18] because like I said we can't do nothing
[16:22] Hallelujah says
[16:25] so with the laying hands on the sick if
[16:28] he says we're anointed to do so from God
[16:32] our hands represent God's hands that's
[16:35] the only hands he has is ours
