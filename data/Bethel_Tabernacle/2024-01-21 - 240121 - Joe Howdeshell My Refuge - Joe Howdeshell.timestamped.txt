[48:23] morning if you have your Bibles I'd like
[48:25] for you to turn with us you
[48:54] can
[54:50] unel
[54:52] follows and everything that he got his
[54:54] he got involved in was trouble on every
[54:57] hand and his mom and dad said why do you
[55:01] have to go down amongst those
[55:03] Philistines uncircumcised when we have
[55:06] daughters amongst your brethren and it
[55:08] grieve their
[55:09] heart and but if you go on down into the
[55:14] that's in in uh to the next verse it
[55:17] says but they did not know that it was
[55:20] of the Lord because God sought an
[55:23] occasion against the Philistines SC
[55:26] because they had dominion over the
[55:28] children of
[55:29] Israel everything was for God's purpose
[55:32] and his
[55:33] plan and we look at as we're going
[55:36] through it we're like oh my goodness I
[55:39] can't I can't handle this but as you're
[55:42] going through it knowing that there's a
[55:45] purpose and a plan for everything you in
[55:48] your life that God
[55:51] has now some people when hard times come
[55:55] um I had a brother in the message who
[55:58] told me that he lost his
[56:01] son and he
[56:03] said that what happened to him is he
[56:05] just gave up on everything he quit going
[56:08] to church quit talking to people he he
[56:13] didn't want to even be around any
[56:16] believers and that's what'll happen
[56:19] sometimes and what I wanted to talk
[56:21] about is is the world it'll tell you um
[56:26] when you listen to a song or you watch a
[56:28] movie or you see something like that it
[56:31] says well pick up a
[56:34] bottle go to an old bar stool I'll tell
[56:37] it to the old Long Tall cold beer I'll
[56:41] talk I'll talk to that one or I'll talk
[56:42] to the liquor glass or I'll talk to this
[56:45] that and other and that's the answer
[56:47] that the devil wants you to take when a
[56:50] hard time comes he wants you to turn to
[56:54] everything except exep for
[56:55] God if he can put a peel in your hand or
[56:59] somebody says have you got a cigarette
[57:01] maybe when they're nervous see it's
[57:04] these kind of things that'll calm your
[57:06] nerves but brother bam said there's not
[57:08] a pill that can take away that
[57:12] nervousness and we know it's spiritual
[57:15] warfare and the devil puts things in
[57:17] your life to throw you off
[57:20] track oh but what the enemy meant for
[57:23] evil God meant it for
[57:25] good he can't win either way he's a
[57:29] defeated foe from the word
[57:31] go just going through the motions that's
[57:35] right we have to
[57:36] believe
[57:38] amen now there's something that took
[57:42] place in brother brandom's
[57:44] life we wonder why these things have to
[57:47] be my heading on this one is called the
[57:50] danger zone so now the what is the
[57:52] trouble so now so what see so
[57:56] what brother ramam said now there was
[57:59] the hardest and most treacherous time of
[58:00] my life taken from the life story Sharon
[58:03] Rose was laying dying her eyes crossed
[58:07] she
[58:08] was suffering so
[58:11] hard and he said that he prayed and it
[58:13] was like a black sheet came down God
[58:16] wouldn't hear his
[58:17] prayer he said that was the most
[58:19] treacherous time of my life cuz I want
[58:21] to tell you something you're going to go
[58:23] through something your life you are
[58:27] going to get a knock like you've never
[58:29] got
[58:29] before and don't wait till that
[58:33] time to find out where you
[58:36] stand make sure your Hope Is Anchored In
[58:40] nothing less than Jesus Christ because
[58:44] it'll knock you for a
[58:46] loop it'll Knock You Plum
[58:50] out and don't look at somebody who maybe
[58:53] it didn't happen to and say well they're
[58:55] a Superman they're a lot stronger than I
[58:58] am like I told my son the other day I
[59:00] said when you go to the
[59:02] gym and you're a big old boy you might
[59:05] can pick up deadlift 400 pounds or
[59:07] something like that but another fellow
[59:09] might come in like my size I might not
[59:11] be able to get up maybe 200 pounds or
[59:13] something does that make me a less
[59:15] person than him or any is he any better
[59:17] than I am no what it means is that he
[59:19] has put his body through more stress in
[59:22] life because the way that your muscles
[59:25] get stronger is to put them under stress
[59:28] am and that goes the same for your
[59:30] spiritual
[59:32] Constitution if everything's a flowery
[59:34] bed of ease you're going to be just a
[59:36] tub of
[59:37] jelly see but God's got to put you
[59:40] through the ringer sometimes he's got to
[59:43] put you through stress in your life that
[59:46] makes you a stronger person you take an
[59:49] older man maybe in the Hard Knocks are
[59:51] coming and a young man he's just shaking
[59:53] he don't know what to do about it and I
[59:55] told him I said I'm older than you are
[59:57] I've been through a lot more I've been a
[1:00:00] don't mean I'm no better than you are
[1:00:02] but I've had the Hard Knocks I've got
[1:00:04] knocked down so many times and had to
[1:00:06] get right back up
[1:00:08] again but that's life and that's a
[1:00:11] training ground for us that's boot camp
[1:00:15] you're not going into battle until you
[1:00:16] go to boot
[1:00:17] camp gotta go through the training
[1:00:20] that's right gotta go through that
[1:00:21] strength training you got to go through
[1:00:23] the endurance training and God is not
[1:00:25] going to put anything on you unless
[1:00:27] you're ready for it now is that right so
[1:00:30] be
[1:00:31] ready because it's
[1:00:34] coming now brother random said
[1:00:37] this now there was the hardest and most
[1:00:40] treacherous time of my life when I
[1:00:42] raised up and looked at her and I
[1:00:44] thought Satan put in my mind well you
[1:00:46] mean as hard as you've preached see he's
[1:00:50] having a pity
[1:00:51] party feeling sorry for your there devil
[1:00:55] oh he loves that that's one party he can
[1:00:58] throw he can give you a pity party oh
[1:01:02] yeah and that's a danger zone because
[1:01:05] when you're going through grief and
[1:01:07] you're going through a hard
[1:01:10] trial it's a lot feels a whole lot
[1:01:12] better to turn that grief into anger
[1:01:15] yeah it's easier to deal with if you can
[1:01:16] blame
[1:01:19] somebody you can blame somebody or you
[1:01:21] can blame something amen you know in
[1:01:25] this world today accidents just don't
[1:01:27] happen somebody's always to
[1:01:29] blame see always got to blame somebody
[1:01:32] for
[1:01:33] something and in that little place right
[1:01:36] there of grief that you're hurting so
[1:01:39] bad you want to turn that it's so easy
[1:01:41] to turn it to anger but let me tell you
[1:01:44] that's the danger zone that's where
[1:01:46] Satan lives right
[1:01:48] there when that thing when you get to
[1:01:50] that point and you will one day you'll
[1:01:52] get to that point always remember to
[1:01:55] turn that thing over to
[1:01:58] God look at what brother brandham did
[1:02:00] right
[1:02:02] here Satan put in my mind well you mean
[1:02:05] as hard as you preached and the way
[1:02:06] you've lived now when it comes to your
[1:02:09] own baby he'll turn you down and I said
[1:02:11] that's right if he can't save my baby
[1:02:14] then I can't see he
[1:02:17] almost listen to what the devil had to
[1:02:19] say wow then I stopped I just didn't
[1:02:23] know what to do
[1:02:25] and he said I said Lord you gave her to
[1:02:27] me and you taken her away blessed be the
[1:02:31] name of the Lord if you take even me
[1:02:34] I'll still love
[1:02:36] you now that's the so
[1:02:39] what that's the that's the danger zone
[1:02:43] that the devil has for all of
[1:02:46] us because what'll happen if you let
[1:02:49] that slide over to the anger side yes
[1:02:52] there's a there's a there's a place in
[1:02:54] there there that you're not going to be
[1:02:56] able to do anything without
[1:02:58] anger that's where Vengeance comes from
[1:03:00] that's where hatred comes from malice
[1:03:02] and all these things so you can't vent
[1:03:05] it you can't get revenge what are you
[1:03:07] going to do so then you get
[1:03:10] depressed because really depression is
[1:03:13] is anger it's an unmet need in your life
[1:03:16] it's an unmet expectation realistic
[1:03:20] expectation that becomes anger then that
[1:03:22] turns into depression
[1:03:25] and that depression it can take you down
[1:03:28] so low it'll pull you away from
[1:03:31] fellowship you won't want to talk to
[1:03:33] nobody you won't want to go to church
[1:03:35] you won't want to put on a tape you
[1:03:37] don't want to sing you don't want to
[1:03:39] play M you don't want to do any of the
[1:03:41] things that you used to
[1:03:43] do but that's what the devil wants you
[1:03:46] to
[1:03:47] do that's exactly as good as he would
[1:03:49] have it to have you in a dark place in a
[1:03:53] deep dark
[1:03:55] place that's where that that's where the
[1:03:57] devil lives see and then what happens if
[1:04:01] you can't get rid of that depression and
[1:04:03] then that anger is built with it and
[1:04:05] that self-pity oh woe is me I deserve
[1:04:09] better than this I don't deserve to be
[1:04:11] going through this I wanted more time
[1:04:13] with him I wanted I I I I
[1:04:16] I it's all about
[1:04:19] me when you start thinking about oh God
[1:04:22] I claimed him for
[1:04:25] you in the name of Jesus
[1:04:29] Christ I have an
[1:04:33] assurance My Hope Is Anchored In nothing
[1:04:39] less I know one
[1:04:42] thing I I want to give this
[1:04:47] testimony you
[1:04:50] believe that God can give you a a
[1:04:53] message from 15 years before it ever
[1:04:56] even
[1:04:59] happens we were up
[1:05:01] in uh brother Roy Shrewsberry and
[1:05:03] brother Billy Paul Brandon was there
[1:05:05] gave his testimony gave a wonderful just
[1:05:09] a moving testimony as as always just the
[1:05:12] Holy Spirit came down and brother Steve
[1:05:14] and brother Bobby was there and my wife
[1:05:17] and my children we were all there and my
[1:05:20] goodness my son Joseph was down he got
[1:05:23] in the floor and he had hands up just
[1:05:25] trembling praising God about 11 years
[1:05:27] old 12 years
[1:05:29] old how that when he went up after the
[1:05:31] service brother Billy Paul was there and
[1:05:33] he had his Bible and he took his Bible
[1:05:35] and went up and said brother Billy I
[1:05:36] want you to sign my Bible and brother
[1:05:38] Billy Paul signed it around on the fly
[1:05:40] leaf there and and so the other day um
[1:05:43] about a month ago when he passed I was
[1:05:46] been up all night laying there all
[1:05:48] night oh my I just you couldn't go to I
[1:05:51] couldn't go to sleep I just kept seeing
[1:05:52] him in in my mind amen I get up and I I
[1:05:55] go I I'm thinking about when brother
[1:05:58] Brandon went beyond the curtain of time
[1:06:00] and I was thinking about that and how
[1:06:03] that when he was there and and he he
[1:06:06] said when I got there he said you know
[1:06:08] all the millions of people came running
[1:06:10] to him they said oh our precious
[1:06:12] brother
[1:06:14] and they said one day when Jesus comes
[1:06:19] we'll go back to Earth and you'll be
[1:06:23] judged for what you've preached and when
[1:06:26] you're accepted and if you're accepted
[1:06:28] which you will be then you'll present us
[1:06:31] to him as trophies of your
[1:06:34] ministry and he said about that time and
[1:06:37] a voice said press the
[1:06:38] battle and he looked down he he felt
[1:06:41] something lick his hand and there was a
[1:06:43] dog right there that was old Fritz his
[1:06:46] hunting dog and he heard something
[1:06:48] nicker and there was his
[1:06:50] horse now if you go back and you
[1:06:52] remember when Danny Henry had a he was a
[1:06:56] brother brandom said he was just a um
[1:06:59] Baptist member of the Full Gospel
[1:07:01] businessman didn't even know anything
[1:07:03] about the baptism of the Holy Ghost but
[1:07:05] he said he came up and got a hold of
[1:07:07] brother brandham and immediately started
[1:07:08] speaking in tongues in perfect
[1:07:11] French and it was it was interpreted by
[1:07:14] a un interpreter man named Victor leuk
[1:07:18] and he wrote it out and it was it was um
[1:07:23] there was like Witnesses is there three
[1:07:24] two or three other ones a woman came up
[1:07:26] and and different ones and it
[1:07:29] paraphrasing I I can't remember exactly
[1:07:30] what it said but said because you've
[1:07:32] chosen the hard way which is my way a
[1:07:35] great portion of Heaven awaits you what
[1:07:38] a reward I want to take that hard way
[1:07:41] don't you oh I'll take the way of the
[1:07:44] Lord's despise
[1:07:46] few greater portion of Heaven awaits
[1:07:50] you so when he got up when he went
[1:07:52] beyond the curtain of time and and you
[1:07:55] you'll have to go back and listen to it
[1:07:57] again it'll do your heart good and a
[1:08:00] voice spoke
[1:08:02] twice and said all that you ever loved
[1:08:05] and all that ever loved you will be here
[1:08:08] what a
[1:08:10] reward said it again all that you ever
[1:08:13] loved and all that ever loved you will
[1:08:15] be
[1:08:16] there well I remember
[1:08:19] that and I got up and I got his Bible
[1:08:24] and I picked up the Bible and I opened
[1:08:27] up the fly leaf and brother Billy P had
[1:08:30] signed his name brother Billy Paul
[1:08:32] brandham and under it he' wrote Matthew
[1:08:36] 10:41 brother can you pull that up on
[1:08:39] the
[1:08:39] screen Matthew 10:41 I didn't even know
[1:08:42] what it
[1:08:44] was I've read it but when it comes up I
[1:08:48] want you to read it with me and it was
[1:08:50] like the Lord just confirming something
[1:08:52] to me that he had wrote his
[1:08:55] Bible I guess that was probably
[1:08:58] back probably 10 years before I guess it
[1:09:01] was about 10 years and it was just a
[1:09:04] confirmation to
[1:09:07] me you know sometimes the Lord just
[1:09:09] gives you things on purpose don't he and
[1:09:11] it's just for you amen whenever it comes
[1:09:15] up brother is that there it is he that
[1:09:18] receiveth a prophet in the name of a
[1:09:20] prophet shall receive a prophet's reward
[1:09:24] he that receiveth a righteous man in the
[1:09:26] name of a righteous man shall receive a
[1:09:29] righteous man's
[1:09:31] reward I put that on my son's grave
[1:09:34] marker because I believe that if we
[1:09:36] receive the word of this
[1:09:39] hour we'll be beneficiaries of that same
[1:09:45] reward like brother Jason said that same
[1:09:47] faith that you have in your heart for
[1:09:49] your loved one even if you die and go by
[1:09:51] way of the Grave when you come up that
[1:09:53] faith is still Al
[1:09:57] amen he said I believe what is the Holy
[1:10:00] Ghost he said there'll be a power
[1:10:02] working in this church one day that'll
[1:10:04] be so powerful the Holy Ghost will be
[1:10:06] moving it'll literally draw the Dead
[1:10:07] from the
[1:10:11] graves Christ in
[1:10:14] us he's looking for empty vessels to
[1:10:18] fill we got to empty out
[1:10:20] first remember the story of Elisha when
[1:10:24] the widow
[1:10:25] woman her husband died and her sons were
[1:10:27] going to be sold to pay the debt said go
[1:10:31] get
[1:10:32] vessels all this all we got go borrow
[1:10:34] some get all you can get fill it up
[1:10:37] God's looking for empty vessels this
[1:10:39] morning but we got to empty out of
[1:10:41] everything that's not like him
[1:10:43] amen
[1:10:47] amen Lord help
[1:10:52] me
[1:10:54] covered that already so now what do we
[1:10:57] do now what that's so what we had what
[1:11:01] so what now what so we know what the
[1:11:04] danger is what do we do about it how do
[1:11:07] we avoid falling into that trap yes you
[1:11:10] know you can benefit from counselors
[1:11:12] even even Solomon said that in a
[1:11:14] multitude of counselors we have safety I
[1:11:17] believe in that I believe we need to if
[1:11:19] you're going through something find
[1:11:20] somebody who can you can talk to and you
[1:11:22] can you know
[1:11:24] Godly men I'm not talking about these
[1:11:25] rep probates out there but I mean Godly
[1:11:27] men and women somebody who's been
[1:11:29] through the trials and been through the
[1:11:31] tribulations and and and you know I'll
[1:11:34] listen to people even on the radio some
[1:11:35] of these ministers and and I'll listen
[1:11:37] to these men I'm like I'm I'm thinking
[1:11:39] myself why do I enjoy them me and my
[1:11:41] wife were talking about that why do I
[1:11:42] enjoy them so much they don't know the
[1:11:43] truth like like we know it but my soul
[1:11:46] can really benefit from what they're
[1:11:47] saying and I'll tell you what it comes
[1:11:49] down to they may not have the knowledge
[1:11:50] but the men have wisdom and they've been
[1:11:53] through some of of the things they've
[1:11:54] been through the hard knocks and as much
[1:11:55] as they know they have they have come
[1:11:58] through the fire so to speak and they
[1:12:00] have something to offer
[1:12:03] Amen brother Braham said Billy Graham
[1:12:05] had the Holy Ghost but he was anointed
[1:12:08] and he was ordained to do what he did he
[1:12:10] couldn't do what brother brandom did
[1:12:12] Brother brandom couldn't do what he did
[1:12:14] he was in a certain place and he stayed
[1:12:16] in his position
[1:12:19] amen now we can talk about these issues
[1:12:21] that we're having we can we can go
[1:12:23] through all kind of things but we got to
[1:12:25] realize there's only one relief from the
[1:12:28] pain amen and that's
[1:12:30] God he's the only
[1:12:32] way now we we know that in on in the
[1:12:36] book of Hebrews chapter 11 it says
[1:12:38] without faith it is impossible to please
[1:12:41] him for he that cometh to God must
[1:12:44] believe that he is amen
[1:12:49] comma and he is a rewarder of them that
[1:12:52] diligently seek him so you must believe
[1:12:56] first off that God is Not
[1:12:59] was not will be but he is right now he
[1:13:04] is the god of now he told even he even
[1:13:07] told that to Moses I am that I am not I
[1:13:11] will be or or I was but he is the ever
[1:13:14] present tense God right now to meet the
[1:13:17] need that you have and you must believe
[1:13:20] that it won't do you a bit of good to
[1:13:23] get on your knees and say well this
[1:13:25] might work no no no You Must
[1:13:28] Believe even as Paul said that the
[1:13:31] weapons that we pick up every
[1:13:33] day that we have is the is the
[1:13:36] breastplate of righteousness amen oh put
[1:13:38] it on every morning put on the helmet of
[1:13:41] salvation but he said this above all
[1:13:45] what is it the shield of
[1:13:47] Faith because that's what operates all
[1:13:49] the rest of
[1:13:50] them you've got to have faith
[1:13:54] if a little child gets a thorn in its
[1:13:56] finger if it don't think it mama can
[1:13:57] help it it won't go to Mama it won't go
[1:14:00] to Daddy but it must believe that Daddy
[1:14:02] can help that take that thorn out oh
[1:14:05] what a terrible thing that would be for
[1:14:07] a child to not have the confidence in
[1:14:09] its own father that Daddy I got a
[1:14:12] splinter can you help me get it
[1:14:13] out see a lot of times we don't go to
[1:14:17] God we don't take like the song says
[1:14:20] have we trials and temptations is there
[1:14:23] trouble
[1:14:24] anywhere take it to the Lord in prayer
[1:14:28] see we've got to take it to him and I
[1:14:32] know that sounds simple but when you're
[1:14:33] going through the battle and you're
[1:14:35] reing your hands and walking the floor
[1:14:37] and you don't know what to do with
[1:14:39] yourself you better remember where to
[1:14:41] take that grief
[1:14:43] too take that anger too it's got to go
[1:14:48] somewhere don't let it stay
[1:14:50] inside because it'll Fester and it'll
[1:14:53] grow into something that's
[1:14:55] ugly it will it'll turn into something
[1:14:58] real bad and and you'll well I've done
[1:15:02] said that it'll pull you away it'll
[1:15:04] it'll put it fill your life with
[1:15:06] bitterness and anger
[1:15:09] amen he is the I am that I
[1:15:13] am so what do we do we've got to give
[1:15:16] him everything that's right cast all
[1:15:20] your cares upon Him for he carth for you
[1:15:24] you got to believe that he
[1:15:27] does and and when you're praying I'll go
[1:15:31] through days sometimes it hits you and
[1:15:33] you're you're going through uh regret
[1:15:36] sorrow pain anger hopelessness all these
[1:15:40] feelings every one of them take it to
[1:15:42] the Lord in
[1:15:44] prayer let me tell you something when
[1:15:45] you're going through that if you're
[1:15:47] maybe it don't have to be losing a loved
[1:15:49] one it could be financial trouble you
[1:15:51] want to talk about something that'll
[1:15:52] weigh on your mind mind more than almost
[1:15:55] anything is when you can't pay your
[1:15:57] bills or your your job's in Jeopardy you
[1:15:59] might be losing your home or something
[1:16:01] like that's going on it'll shake you and
[1:16:03] you just can't hardly get no rest or no
[1:16:05] peace or nothing say God this is this is
[1:16:08] stronger than I can do this is stronger
[1:16:10] than I can handle it's too strong for me
[1:16:13] God help me that's what God wants you to
[1:16:16] do sometimes he allows things to come
[1:16:18] into your life just to drive you to
[1:16:21] him they got I can't do this and and
[1:16:24] just say oh God I'll give it to you in
[1:16:26] the name of Jesus Christ you may not
[1:16:29] feel immediate relief I'm not GNA
[1:16:31] promise that you will but I tell you
[1:16:33] what if you do it over and you do it
[1:16:36] over again that's right God will replace
[1:16:39] that grief with joy he'll replace that
[1:16:42] anger with
[1:16:44] happiness he'll replace that that
[1:16:47] sadness with oh my just
[1:16:50] exaltation the next time somebody sees
[1:16:52] you your have hands lifted up you'll be
[1:16:55] praising His holy name because the devil
[1:16:58] wants to get you down into a place to
[1:17:00] where you feel like that you are nobody
[1:17:03] and you're
[1:17:04] nothing tell another thing he'll do to
[1:17:06] you he'll remind you of your
[1:17:08] past is that
[1:17:12] right oh me and brother Jason were
[1:17:14] talking in the back and I heard this
[1:17:17] also too that the psychologists are
[1:17:19] talking and how they had all this out
[1:17:22] there that positive thinking the power
[1:17:24] of positive thinking it's so good well
[1:17:27] that ain't that's okay but if you got
[1:17:29] this negativity over here you're just
[1:17:30] piling positive on top of it you still
[1:17:32] got negativity
[1:17:33] there the best thing to do is get rid of
[1:17:36] the negative feelings the negative
[1:17:38] thoughts empty out of those things you
[1:17:41] you you can take you say well I can't do
[1:17:44] it God can that's right say God I can't
[1:17:47] do help me with this negative thought
[1:17:49] that I've got I'm always thinking
[1:17:51] negative about myself I'm worried about
[1:17:53] about the end of the world I'm worried
[1:17:54] about making this bill I'm worried about
[1:17:56] getting sick or cancer or this that and
[1:17:58] other God take these things from
[1:18:01] me and restore unto me give me that joy
[1:18:04] that I
[1:18:05] need the joy of my
[1:18:07] salvation CU he promised that he would
[1:18:10] do it he's the god of our refuge amen he
[1:18:14] is our
[1:18:15] refuge and that's the title of this
[1:18:17] message this morning my refuge amen it's
[1:18:20] not in a bottle it's not in a pel it's
[1:18:23] not in a self-help program it's not in
[1:18:25] all these things that people do but take
[1:18:28] it to God go straight to him say oh God
[1:18:32] I give this to you I can't handle it I
[1:18:35] can't hold it anymore and he said come
[1:18:37] unto me all ye that are heavy laden I'll
[1:18:41] give you
[1:18:42] rest but we got to believe that he'll
[1:18:45] take it from
[1:18:46] us see comes back down to faith without
[1:18:50] faith it's impossible to please him so
[1:18:52] we've got to believe that he'll do
[1:18:54] it now here's something else the devil
[1:18:58] would
[1:19:01] do see the God is also the god of your
[1:19:04] past
[1:19:08] amen as we're seeing now in the as the
[1:19:11] nation is
[1:19:13] progressing we see how that that they
[1:19:16] are trying to rewrite
[1:19:19] history and and there's a there's a
[1:19:21] funny thing about that
[1:19:23] because if you do it in the negative if
[1:19:25] you rewrite
[1:19:27] history and and you and you present a
[1:19:29] different version of historical
[1:19:32] facts you can literally steer the future
[1:19:35] of a
[1:19:38] Nation you can steer the direction that
[1:19:42] the nation goes in by rewriting what the
[1:19:45] past
[1:19:47] was right because if if just take
[1:19:51] Germany if they continually look back in
[1:19:54] the past with a uh a a wonderful view of
[1:19:59] Nazism and they look back in the past
[1:20:01] and said oh the Glory Days of the Nazi
[1:20:05] party then what would the future look
[1:20:08] like they would be steering to the same
[1:20:10] direction from where they came from but
[1:20:13] they had to look back into the past and
[1:20:15] see what a terrible thing that was and
[1:20:18] it steered the country into a completely
[1:20:21] different direction as far away from the
[1:20:24] past as it was
[1:20:26] see and they're doing that with America
[1:20:29] now in the negative they're taking all
[1:20:32] of the principles that were Godly and
[1:20:35] they're saying oh it was a bunch of
[1:20:37] racist bigots that started the country
[1:20:39] and so now it's tainted everything
[1:20:41] they've written including the
[1:20:42] Constitution so all these things should
[1:20:44] be changed by a new enlightened group of
[1:20:46] people who are running the country
[1:20:48] nowadays and that's the direction that
[1:20:51] it's moving into see
[1:20:53] so you can take that in a positive and a
[1:20:55] negative but now let's take it into a a
[1:20:58] positive view amen and let's see what
[1:21:01] God wants you to see about your own life
[1:21:03] and about your own past because there's
[1:21:05] one thing I found out is that I know
[1:21:08] that if a child is abused as a child and
[1:21:12] and specifically molested um that child
[1:21:14] will grow up with a tainted view of its
[1:21:17] own self it'll grow up with guilt and
[1:21:20] it'll grow up with depression and it'll
[1:21:23] manifest itself in drug use and
[1:21:26] promiscuity and all kinds of of terrible
[1:21:28] things that it had nothing to do with it
[1:21:31] was not its fault it was a victim in the
[1:21:36] affair but they're looking at what
[1:21:38] happened to them with adult
[1:21:40] eyes when what happened to them they
[1:21:43] were a child and Paul said when I was a
[1:21:46] child I thought as a child but you're
[1:21:48] looking at yourself and you're
[1:21:50] condemning yourself for what what
[1:21:52] happened to you back then
[1:21:56] see and you'll grow up thinking but when
[1:21:58] you realize that I I was a victim in
[1:22:01] that I had nothing to do with that then
[1:22:03] you're set free from that thing and then
[1:22:06] you can go on and then you know that God
[1:22:08] has set you
[1:22:09] free I had nothing to do with that the
[1:22:11] guilt is
[1:22:13] gone guilt of the past and it's what is
[1:22:17] where is the guilt then put back on to
[1:22:19] the one who did it to start
[1:22:21] with that goes for you and I with a life
[1:22:24] of sin that we had Satan might try to
[1:22:27] come and condemn you look at what you
[1:22:29] did look at the life you lived look at
[1:22:32] all the things that you did oh but let's
[1:22:34] put that guilt right back on the one
[1:22:35] where it come from had nothing to do
[1:22:38] with me Satan you tricked me into it you
[1:22:42] T me into it I got out there yeah I
[1:22:44] strayed
[1:22:47] away but thank God GL he called my
[1:22:51] name I'm not carrying the guilt anymore
[1:22:55] I'm not
[1:22:57] carrying I'm not carrying
[1:22:59] anymore back on the devil where it
[1:23:01] belongs
[1:23:03] amen praise be to
[1:23:08] God do you have that P could you find
[1:23:10] that picture you couldn't find it that's
[1:23:15] okay brother
[1:23:20] brandom well this is a this is a
[1:23:29] uh brother could you get my phone off
[1:23:32] the desk back there I I want to show it
[1:23:35] I might be able
[1:23:41] to this is a poem by Cory tan
[1:23:45] boom he was a holocaust
[1:23:49] Survivor talk about going through some
[1:23:51] hard times
[1:23:53] amen me you and I haven't hardly seen
[1:23:56] anything her whole bethl Tabernacle
[1:23:59] sound booth at
[1:24:03] gmail.com
[1:24:06] well this is the poem that she wrote or
[1:24:10] I don't know if she wrote it but this is
[1:24:11] the one she would give says life is but
[1:24:14] a
[1:24:15] weaving my life is but a weaving between
[1:24:18] my God and me I cannot choose the colors
[1:24:21] he weaveth steadily
[1:24:23] oftimes he weaveth sorrow and I and
[1:24:25] Foolish Pride forget he sees upper and I
[1:24:29] the
[1:24:30] underside till the loom is silent and
[1:24:32] the shuttle cease to fly will God unroll
[1:24:35] the canvas and reveal the reason why see
[1:24:38] if I can find that picture you might be
[1:24:40] able to see it from my phone
[1:24:44] it's it I think I
[1:24:48] it's I don't know if you can see this
[1:24:50] it's uh it's kind of a mess ain't it can
[1:24:54] you see that just colors you see
[1:24:56] that some of you might have seen this
[1:24:59] before but it's just an old mess of
[1:25:01] colors
[1:25:02] and red and green and all kinds of
[1:25:05] things like
[1:25:07] that but there's something that takes
[1:25:09] place can y'all see it back there you
[1:25:12] see there's something that takes
[1:25:15] place in the life of a
[1:25:19] believer that believes in what God can
[1:25:22] do
[1:25:25] it says God unrolls the canvas and
[1:25:29] reveal the reason why the dark threads
[1:25:31] are as needful as the Weaver's skillful
[1:25:33] hand as the threads of gold and silver
[1:25:36] in the pattern he has planned he knows
[1:25:39] he loves he cares nothing this truth
[1:25:42] condemn he gives the very best to those
[1:25:45] who trust him now that was the side that
[1:25:49] we see that's our life that's that's the
[1:25:52] life that we're looking at all we see is
[1:25:54] a mess we see the trials we don't
[1:25:59] understand why but the flip side that
[1:26:02] was a
[1:26:04] tapestry and the flip side of that
[1:26:06] tapestry is what God is weaving for us
[1:26:09] can you see that there's the crown right
[1:26:11] there but that's the flip side of it the
[1:26:14] back side is a jumbled mess it's just
[1:26:16] nasty looking old strings that's your
[1:26:18] life that's your trials that's your
[1:26:21] troubles but what God is weaving in your
[1:26:24] life right now is a Crown of
[1:26:37] Glory first Peter when the chief 54 says
[1:26:42] when the chief Shepherd shall appear you
[1:26:44] shall receive a Crown of Glory fadeth
[1:26:48] not way I'm ready for the chief Shepherd
[1:26:51] to come at you
[1:26:53] oh even so come Lord Jesus come quickly
[1:26:56] Lord
[1:26:58] Jesus brother brandom said this on the
[1:27:01] life story he said some people say he
[1:27:04] made mistakes that's fine that's okay he
[1:27:07] was a man I'm a man Elijah was a man
[1:27:11] John the Baptist was a
[1:27:13] man brother Bram said and may all my
[1:27:16] mistakes in
[1:27:18] life only be a stepping stone to others
[1:27:22] W so is it okay if you made
[1:27:24] mistakes that's all right with me if
[1:27:27] it'll be a stepping stone for
[1:27:30] me that would bring them closer to thee
[1:27:34] granted Lord May Sinners see the
[1:27:36] footprints on the sands of time may
[1:27:40] they be led to
[1:27:44] thee in Psalms 46 it says God is our
[1:27:48] refuge and
[1:27:49] strength very present help and trouble
[1:27:54] therefore will we not fear though the

[1:29:56] center of your life amen he can take all
[1:30:00] the hurt he can take all the pain why he
[1:30:03] took it into
[1:30:04] himself you know there's another
[1:30:06] scripture there's two times in the Bible
[1:30:09] where it said that somebody's somebody
[1:30:11] was almost vexed to death almost to
[1:30:14] death one was was Samson when Delila was
[1:30:17] was wearing upon him and wearing upon
[1:30:20] him and he loved her but she didn't love
[1:30:22] him and and she had him down and and and
[1:30:25] he was so infatuated with her and he and
[1:30:27] she kept saying you you you've mocked me
[1:30:29] and and you won't tell me your secret
[1:30:31] the devil wants to know your secret this
[1:30:33] morning he wants to know everything what
[1:30:35] makes you tick he wants to know how to
[1:30:37] get your strength from you and that's
[1:30:40] what she was doing to him and the Bible
[1:30:43] says that she vexed his soul unto
[1:30:46] death that he wanted to die he couldn't
[1:30:49] handle it he wanted to kill himself that
[1:30:52] he got into such a state from her
[1:30:54] bewitching and her her um what Jezebel
[1:30:59] spirit is all it is you want to talk
[1:31:01] about the spirits they don't
[1:31:03] die the Bible talks about seven spirits
[1:31:05] of God in Revelation are there seven
[1:31:08] gods no it's the seven manifestations of
[1:31:10] the same spirit of God and so is that
[1:31:13] devil of Jezebel who was manifested in
[1:31:15] Jezebel manifested in Delilah manifested
[1:31:18] in herodias and manifested in this day
[1:31:21] also
[1:31:22] to try to Temp the sons of God and the
[1:31:24] daughters of God away from the kingdom
[1:31:26] of
[1:31:27] God Satan will work and he'll do
[1:31:29] everything he can let me tell you
[1:31:31] something there's another scripture in
[1:31:33] the Bible where it said another man who
[1:31:34] was sorrowed unto death that was Jesus
[1:31:37] in The Garden of
[1:31:39] Gethsemane he said I'm sorrowful even
[1:31:41] unto
[1:31:43] death not that he wanted to die but that
[1:31:46] he had to take death on him how was it
[1:31:49] that the author of Life The Giver of of
[1:31:51] life and the author of Holiness and
[1:31:54] righteousness had to take my
[1:31:56] unrighteousness upon him and my death he
[1:31:59] stood in my stad amen and he took it
[1:32:02] upon himself oh God help me this morning
[1:32:06] God I I I'm sorry that you did that but
[1:32:08] I'm so glad that you did and I give you
[1:32:11] all my grief I give you my sorrow I give
[1:32:13] you you're the god of my tomorrow you're
[1:32:16] the god of my past and I give everything
[1:32:18] to you this morning
[1:32:20] amen let me tell you something there's
[1:32:22] brother BR said that that you say well
[1:32:24] how how did how did Samson get into such
[1:32:27] a a position to where he wanted to die
[1:32:30] brother bandom said this when them young
[1:32:32] women come down the hallway he was up in
[1:32:33] Canada and they were drinking wearing
[1:32:35] their under clothes and saying kicked up
[1:32:37] their leg said whoopee this is life
[1:32:40] brother random said it's not life he
[1:32:42] said I took him by the hand and said
[1:32:44] it's death you don't realize what you're
[1:32:47] doing amen he said that kind of a
[1:32:50] lifestyle he said well will lead you to
[1:32:53] Suicide it'll pull you so far away from
[1:32:56] God and hopelessness and the devil wants
[1:32:59] to get you out there and even lead you
[1:33:01] to put your gun put a gun to your
[1:33:04] head you don't think that's what
[1:33:06] happened to Samson he got into such a
[1:33:08] place that he wanted to die he didn't
[1:33:10] care he wanted her so much that if I
[1:33:13] can't have her I don't even want to live
[1:33:16] she's all and I'll give her the secret
[1:33:19] see gave it up
[1:33:22] Satan will get you to a place you may
[1:33:24] not get weak the first day you leave

[1:33:30] the first month but just like you take

[1:38:16] hallelujah am man just keep that or if
[1:38:19] he switches that's fine but otherwise
[1:38:21] you can keep that going just quietly
[1:38:23] brother
[1:38:25] Andrew you know
[1:38:27] I I was thinking about when the critic
[1:38:32] came to brother brandham and and he
[1:38:35] tried to say that you know there is no
[1:38:40] God and uh there there is no Divine
[1:38:44] Healing there is there are no Miracles
[1:38:46] there are no Supernatural power and
[1:38:48] brother brandham just said to him you
[1:38:50] come too late late for that
[1:38:52] buddy he said you might have you might
[1:38:54] have told me that a few years ago he
[1:38:56] said but you you too late now he said I
[1:38:58] hav been all around the world he said I
[1:39:00] done experienced it I've seen it you
[1:39:02] remember even even by the time he went
[1:39:04] through that deep dark trial of losing
[1:39:07] his family and he said Satan didn't try
[1:39:11] to tell me there was no God he because
[1:39:13] I'd already met him he said he didn't
[1:39:15] try to tell me there was no God he he
[1:39:17] tried to tell me but he don't care about
[1:39:20] you
[1:39:21] yeah and you know there's something
[1:39:24] about taking up a topic and speaking
[1:39:27] from your heart from experience oh yeah
[1:39:31] I thought about brother Joe in that
[1:39:34] sermon I just kept it going through my
[1:39:36] mind this is a man that's speaking from
[1:39:40] experience you know when somebody can
[1:39:43] bring something doctrinally and it might
[1:39:45] be true but it's not the same thing it's
[1:39:49] just not the same thing
[1:39:51] you can't argue with a man who's been
[1:39:53] there and had that happen you know cuz
[1:39:56] it happened to him and I was thinking
[1:39:58] about him and sister Becky as they were
[1:40:00] singing and what a what a jubilent what
[1:40:03] a testimony that is what a slap to the
[1:40:07] face of the enemy yes my you know I
[1:40:10] thought about a another servant of God
[1:40:12] you talking about Samson you're talking
[1:40:14] about the Lord Jesus I thought about
[1:40:17] Paul Paul got to a point in his life he
[1:40:19] said we despaired of life yes that's
[1:40:22] right despaired of life as far as Paul
[1:40:24] was concerned it was just over there was
[1:40:26] no way to survive it it was just too too
[1:40:30] too
[1:40:31] bad Paul said to the church at
[1:40:36] Corinthia we are troubled on every side
[1:40:40] yet not
[1:40:41] distressed we are perplexed but not in
[1:40:45] despair persecuted he didn't deny the
[1:40:49] persecution but not for forsaken cast
[1:40:52] down that's true that can happen but not
[1:40:56] destroyed yes always bearing about in
[1:41:00] the in the body the dying of the Lord
[1:41:04] Jesus that the life also of Jesus might
[1:41:08] be made
[1:41:10] manifest in our
[1:41:12] [Music]
[1:41:13] body you know you know why
[1:41:17] Paul could have that kind of an attitude
[1:41:21] you know where his strength came from to
[1:41:23] admit to all of that
[1:41:26] distress and trouble and
[1:41:29] perplexity
[1:41:31] persecution cast down and yet he's not
[1:41:35] destroyed he's not in despair he's he he
[1:41:39] he it's just the dying of the Lord Jesus
[1:41:41] Christ he's not forsaken he's not
[1:41:44] destroyed and the reason is
[1:41:47] found where he says in verse six right
[1:41:52] right ahead of saying all of that he
[1:41:54] said for God who commanded the light to
[1:41:57] shine out of Darkness hath shined in our
[1:42:02] hearts oh to do what to give the light
[1:42:05] of the knowledge of the glory of God in
[1:42:09] the face of Jesus Christ I wonder today
[1:42:12] if we're willing to bring glory to God
[1:42:15] in our
[1:42:16] lives he makes a point in the seventh
[1:42:19] verse I'll read it to you from the New
[1:42:21] Living
[1:42:22] Translation now we have this light
[1:42:25] shining in our
[1:42:27] [Music]
[1:42:29] hearts but listen to this
[1:42:32] honesty but we ourselves are like
[1:42:36] fragile clay jars containing this great
[1:42:41] treasure this makes it clear that our
[1:42:45] great power is from God not from
[1:42:49] ourselves how how are you how is Paul
[1:42:51] Still Standing he's a fragile human
[1:42:54] that's a fragile human but he's still
[1:42:56] standing I'm still standing you're still
[1:42:58] standing we're still
[1:43:00] believing yes we're fragile yes life is
[1:43:03] that way sometimes you feel like a
[1:43:05] shattered clay vessel but oh I'm here to
[1:43:08] tell you something friends if the light
[1:43:10] of God is shining in your heart
[1:43:14] hallu I wonder if you know that
[1:43:17] way to get to God brother Joe that was
[1:43:20] such a amazing
[1:43:21] Point said when you come into those
[1:43:24] kinds of times you know you you bring
[1:43:27] all your cares to the Lord you take it
[1:43:30] to the Lord in
[1:43:31] prayer but it's not just a an exercise a
[1:43:35] physical exercise when you go in real
[1:43:38] prayer you know something friends when
[1:43:40] you go in real prayer you go
[1:43:43] somewhere brother Ram talked about that
[1:43:45] you travel somewhere you might still be
[1:43:47] in a room you're still in trapped in
[1:43:50] these Dimensions but you the real you
[1:43:52] goes somewhere and you lift yourself up
[1:43:56] into the atmospheres of God how many
[1:43:58] prayer warriors know that to be a fact
[1:44:01] you hear things and see things you get a
[1:44:04] strength that you can't account for
[1:44:07] Hallelujah and as brother Joe was saying
[1:44:10] in times of trouble I hope you know how
[1:44:12] to get back there I hope you know the
[1:44:15] way to get
[1:44:17] back if you're practiced if you're if
[1:44:20] you're stud if you think about it if you
[1:44:23] if if prayer really means something to
[1:44:27] you you know my my dad was almost
[1:44:32] inexplicably able anywhere he had ever
[1:44:35] been one time he could get back to he
[1:44:37] didn't need a map he could tell you
[1:44:39] exactly how to get there and the roads
[1:44:41] and the direction and what you do and
[1:44:42] where you turn and having only went
[1:44:44] there one time I mean we'd go into big
[1:44:46] Metropolis go into California go into LA
[1:44:49] and we' go back there and he just knew
[1:44:50] exactly how to get and where to go and
[1:44:52] it was almost
[1:44:54] photographic but it's because he paid
[1:44:57] attention and he knew how to get back
[1:45:00] there I why don't you bow your heads
[1:45:02] with me today all over the
[1:45:05] building do you know the way into the
[1:45:08] presence of
