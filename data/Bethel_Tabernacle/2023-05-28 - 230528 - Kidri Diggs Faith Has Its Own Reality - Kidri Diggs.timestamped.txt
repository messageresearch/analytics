[36:39] Wilderness of Paran and kadish and
[36:42] brought back word unto them and unto the
[36:45] congregation and show them the fruit of
[36:48] the land
[36:50] and they told them
[36:52] and said we came unto the land whether
[36:56] thou sentence us and surely it floweth
[36:59] with milk and honey and this is the
[37:03] fruit of it
[37:05] oh my let's go to uh Romans chapter four
[37:18] chapter four
[37:23] Romans 4 let's start reading that um
[37:27] verse 17.
[37:33] as it is written I have made thee a
[37:35] father of many nations before him whom
[37:39] he believes even God
[37:41] who quickeneth the dead and call it
[37:43] those things which be not as though they
[37:48] were
[37:50] who against hope believed in hope that
[37:53] he might become the father of many
[37:55] nations according
[37:57] to that which was spoken so shall thy
[38:01] seed be and being that weak in faith he
[38:04] considered not his own body now dead
[38:07] when he was about a hundred years old
[38:11] neither yet the deadness of Sarah's womb
[38:14] he staggered not at the promise of God
[38:17] through unbelief but was strong in faith
[38:22] giving glory to God and being fully
[38:25] persuaded that what he had promised he
[38:30] was able to perform amen may the Lord
[38:33] blessed reading of his word you can have
[38:35] your seats
[38:41] praise God let's give the Lord a hand
[38:43] clap of praise
[38:44] [Applause]
[38:51] amen by the grace of God today I desire
[38:55] your prayers but we want to use for a
[38:56] subject amen faith has its own reality
[39:01] faith has its own reality
[39:04] now we we've heard so many messages
[39:06] about faith
[39:08] and I just want to declare in my own
[39:11] Christian Life that it never gets old
[39:14] amen because God is always dealing with
[39:17] us on a level of Faith because we can't
[39:20] see everything that God has for us so
[39:23] that's why we're called Believers amen
[39:25] God wants us to believe in what God has
[39:29] for us
[39:30] but you know when when I think of uh
[39:32] faith and reality
[39:34] it's it's
[39:36] let's just look at it faith is looking
[39:38] to the Unseen but reality is what's true
[39:41] Hallelujah
[39:43] so how can your faith look to the Unseen
[39:46] of what's really true amen
[39:48] that's when you believing comes in the
[39:51] hand Hallelujah and you know as we look
[39:53] in the scriptures right here this
[39:55] morning and we take the children of
[39:57] Israel before we get there let's just
[40:00] back up a little bit now the whole
[40:02] reason why the children of Israel were
[40:04] were looking for a land flowing with
[40:07] milk and Honeys because God gave Abraham
[40:09] a promise
[40:10] God gave Abraham a promise that you know
[40:12] your seed is going to be like the stars
[40:14] and so forth like saying you're going to
[40:16] be the father of Nations amen is that
[40:19] what God told Abraham he also told
[40:21] Abraham see that you're going to possess
[40:24] the Gate of your enemy Hallelujah so God
[40:27] is in the business of throwing out a lot
[40:30] of promises hallelujah hallelujah and
[40:33] one thing about a promise when it comes
[40:35] from God it can't be taken back
[40:37] Hallelujah if God said it I want you to
[40:40] catch this now if God said it it has to
[40:43] be a reality
[40:45] Hallelujah if God said it somehow
[40:48] someway it has to come into tuition
[40:51] Hallelujah it has to become real to you
[40:54] as a Believer if God's had it if you're
[40:57] a Believer if you're walking in faith
[40:59] amen and we know that the Bible says
[41:01] faith is the substance of things hoped
[41:04] for the evidence of things what not seen
[41:09] so faith has the ability to make it real
[41:14] faith has the ability to create the
[41:18] substance of what you're hoping for
[41:20] Hallelujah but we're not in this place
[41:22] today hoping amen we're in this place
[41:25] today as Believers amen when we look at
[41:28] the word of God and say that's my
[41:30] reality
[41:31] we look at the word of God and we say
[41:33] that's my truth hallelujah we look at
[41:36] the word of God and say God you said it
[41:38] I believe it and that settles it
[41:41] that's where God wants us to walk
[41:43] Hallelujah but how do we get there
[41:46] Hallelujah
[41:48] it's a walk of Faith amen he told
[41:51] Abraham walk before me and be thou
[41:55] perfect amen those are some strong words
[41:58] God telling a man who's uh almost 100
[42:02] years old walked before me and be thou
[42:06] perfect a man living and seeing a man
[42:09] Hallelujah born in failure
[42:12] now God comes and says Abraham I'm going
[42:16] to give you something to look forward to
[42:18] Abraham I'm going to speak your reality
[42:22] walk before me and be thou perfect
[42:26] that was Abraham's reality
[42:29] but he had to walk into it amen
[42:31] hallelujah what do you have to get
[42:34] through first he had to conquer his own
[42:37] doubts
[42:38] he had to conquer the greatest thing
[42:41] that's hindering the church today
[42:42] brother Matt is our imagination
[42:47] that's the greatest thing hindering us
[42:50] it's your imagination When You Reach
[42:53] opposition what do you think about first
[42:55] what God Said or what's before you
[42:59] and most of the time hallelujah our
[43:03] reality is being controlled by what our
[43:06] eyes see
[43:07] when your reality should be controlled
[43:10] by what truth hallelujah
[43:13] oh my let's look at the word reality
[43:16] reality means
[43:18] the states or quality of being real
[43:22] how many believe in God
[43:25] so God should be your reality this
[43:28] morning
[43:29] everything about him should be real to
[43:31] you this morning Hallelujah Jesus going
[43:34] in the grave and dying and raising again
[43:37] that's a reality to the believer
[43:39] Hallelujah because if he did do that
[43:42] like the Bible says that means that
[43:45] everything he meant for that death to be
[43:48] Hallelujah stands true in a believer's
[43:51] life this morning
[43:52] Hallelujah but you know as us as as
[43:55] children of God you and I as people the
[43:58] thing we have to deal with the most is
[44:01] our own self getting in our own way
[44:04] we become our own hindrances
[44:09] let's start with Abraham Hallelujah and
[44:11] I don't plan being alone today y'all
[44:13] know I'm about to close
[44:19] Hallelujah
[44:20] but George let's look at Abraham
[44:22] Hallelujah God called him what the
[44:26] father of faith
[44:28] God's telling him his reality and the
[44:32] first thing Abraham does he tries to
[44:35] believe God with his five senses
[44:39] oh my
[44:41] how often God gives us a word from
[44:45] heaven and we try to believe it without
[44:47] five senses
[44:49] your Five Sisters oh boy you're gonna
[44:52] say something heavy now your five senses
[44:55] Hallelujah are not connected to your
[44:58] reality
[45:02] [Applause]
[45:06] how can you make a statement like that
[45:09] because the prophet of God said your
[45:11] five senses are connected so you can
[45:13] live on this side
[45:15] Hallelujah but Faith which is my reality
[45:18] is for what where I come from and where
[45:22] I'm going back to so My Five Senses will
[45:25] always deny where I come from
[45:29] because my Five Sisters say you're a
[45:31] body of Flesh
[45:32] your Five Sisters say you don't have 20
[45:34] 20 Vision your five senses say you're
[45:37] hard of hearing your Five Sisters say
[45:39] you got the sickness of that sickness
[45:41] but ask yourself what is my reality
[45:44] according to the word of God
[45:47] oh
[45:50] see the thing about your Five Sisters is
[45:53] your Five Sisters Hallelujah will get
[45:56] you to believe in a lie
[46:00] and strip you away from your reality
[46:04] anybody ever
[46:06] Hallelujah I I know this to be true
[46:09] because it happens to me someone as I
[46:11] get up cause I'm I'm past 25
[46:14] someone as I get up and I feel a little
[46:17] tightness
[46:20] sometimes in my junks Hallelujah
[46:25] that's what I've been dealing with you a
[46:27] long time you changed the pronunciation
[46:28] of it
[46:30] it's in my Jones is in my bones
[46:33] you know when I get up sometimes and
[46:35] it's like oh
[46:36] it's like ah and you know indeed a voice
[46:39] will come and say you have this or you
[46:42] have that but the reality of it is by
[46:46] his stripes I'm already healed
[46:48] so if I walk in my truth my truth will
[46:51] control early in my next step my truth
[46:54] will control earlier my next step my
[46:57] next step my next step if I can walk in
[47:00] my tooth and my truth will become what
[47:02] my reality
[47:04] Hallelujah I love how the prophet of God
[47:06] said Hallelujah you are your thoughts
[47:10] what you're thinking right now that's
[47:12] who you are if you're thinking about
[47:14] Krispy Kreme Donuts you are a donut
[47:20] let's change it I know what some of you
[47:22] thinking about you thinking about that
[47:23] chicken
[47:27] it's barely and it starts to control
[47:30] your thoughts
[47:31] oh my but let's make it spiritual church
[47:34] you are what's your thoughts say you are
[47:39] the greatest battle ever fought is
[47:41] wearing the mind
[47:43] but let's bring it brother Jason if we
[47:44] can't can we bring it to the proper
[47:46] perspective
[47:48] we we we love to use that when we're
[47:51] going through a battle
[47:54] well brother I'm trying to believe but
[47:56] you know the prophet says the greatest
[47:58] battle ever fall is in the mind
[48:02] I'm trying to believe the greatest
[48:04] battle of a fall yes brother I know what
[48:07] the prophet said but I'm going through a
[48:09] battle
[48:13] we shouldn't use quotes
[48:16] to succumb to the pressure
[48:19] but we should stand on what we believe
[48:23] and walk into our reality
[48:26] the king the prophet of God wasn't
[48:27] saying the greatest battle ever fought
[48:30] is in the mind for us hallelujah to give
[48:33] over to the devil
[48:36] he wasn't saying that for us to
[48:39] surrender our mind our thoughts to the
[48:41] devil no he said it's a battle that
[48:44] means God wants your mind too
[48:47] Hallelujah that's what makes it a battle
[48:50] not only the devil's trying to get that
[48:52] ground but God also wants that ground
[48:54] Hallelujah but we succumb to depression
[48:57] so many times and we say okay I'm
[48:59] fighting about it in my mind just give
[49:01] it over to God
[49:03] Hallelujah
[49:05] and don't let your me up your
[49:07] imagination take you into areas that are
[49:10] not even true
[49:13] oh my
[49:18] a lot of times your imagination can work
[49:21] Hallelujah against your reality
[49:26] and we're going to get there but look
[49:28] Hallelujah
[49:30] good to see brother Smith praise God
[49:32] hallelujah hey man but you think about
[49:34] it Church
[49:35] you look at Abraham first thing God says
[49:38] to him is you're going to have a son
[49:43] because God already told him you're
[49:44] going to be the father of Nations and
[49:46] this is not going to happen you're going
[49:47] to have a son now he has to get through
[49:49] get past his imagination then the first
[49:52] thing he does he laughs at his reality
[49:57] church I don't know about you if God has
[50:00] ever told me anything I want to believe
[50:02] it
[50:03] sister smell Hallelujah I want to
[50:05] believe it I want to walk in and
[50:07] Hallelujah I don't want to wave her with
[50:09] it but I want to take a step like God
[50:11] told Abraham walk before me and be thou
[50:14] perfect see faith is walking through
[50:16] that word that's been pronounced over
[50:18] your life
[50:19] Hallelujah faith is not just sit back
[50:22] saying I believe Hallelujah Abraham
[50:24] didn't believe
[50:27] he didn't become a Believer until he
[50:29] started walking with God
[50:32] but he was already the father of faith
[50:36] brother Diggs you're contradicting
[50:38] yourself
[50:39] no God made him a believer of his own
[50:43] reality by faith
[50:45] Hallelujah because Abraham couldn't see
[50:48] himself as the father of Faith because
[50:50] he laughed at God Chris he says me
[50:54] the father of faith
[50:56] man I'm 90 years old
[50:59] and then Sarah comes in and hears the
[51:01] same thing now he has to deal with an
[51:03] unbelieving wife
[51:07] boy we're gonna leave that one alone
[51:13] is hard enough believing something on
[51:16] your own but then you have someone else
[51:18] connected to it that don't believe also
[51:21] boy you in trouble trouble trouble
[51:27] and Abraham he started it off because he
[51:30] laughed and all Sarah did was picked up
[51:32] his anointing
[51:34] fathers husbands Hallelujah a lot of
[51:37] times you see things going on in the
[51:38] house because it starts with you first
[51:41] and you it may be a mild form but then
[51:44] your kids will watch it
[51:46] your spouse will watch it different
[51:47] people watch it and the devil used them
[51:50] to take it to the extreme
[51:53] it may have been just a simple Netflix
[51:57] movie Hallelujah but then it turned into
[51:59] Hulu Yoo-hoo sport you Hooters Olu knew
[52:03] who by who every kind of who Yahoo
[52:10] because it started really really simple
[52:15] that's why we had to catch things amen
[52:17] we have to catch with Satan is trying to
[52:19] pull us away from our reality
[52:21] in my reality Hallelujah what's our
[52:25] reality Church our reality as a man is
[52:28] Genesis 1 26.
[52:32] oh
[52:34] we was created to be gods we was created
[52:37] to have dominion over everything
[52:40] Church somebody say everything that
[52:43] means whatever you're going through
[52:44] right now you're supposed to have
[52:45] dominion over it
[52:47] you say everybody how can you say that
[52:49] because the prophet of God said
[52:50] everything Adam lost was restored in
[52:53] Jesus Christ
[52:54] because when Jesus Christ came he walked
[52:57] in his reality
[52:59] oh my what I love about the church he
[53:02] stepped down from being Hallelujah the
[53:05] god of glory and became a man
[53:09] stepped into your reality
[53:11] stepped into our reality how we were
[53:14] going to be born if I could say Jesus
[53:16] did it first
[53:18] Hallelujah anything you can think about
[53:21] I'll bring it back to the scriptures and
[53:23] say Jesus did it first
[53:25] Hallelujah
[53:26] but now Church
[53:28] Abraham God tells him and Sarah you're
[53:30] gonna have a child Hallelujah in your
[53:33] age by Sarah at the appointed time and
[53:36] then Sarah gets anointed and says can't
[53:38] be
[53:39] me having pleasure with my Lord at this
[53:41] old age or whatever the case may be no
[53:44] he must mean Hagar
[53:46] she got in the way
[53:48] of the Walk of faith
[53:51] which changed the reality
[53:54] or produce something that God didn't
[53:57] intend to produce
[53:59] sure
[54:00] they produced in Ishmael
[54:03] which was something wild something
[54:05] untameable something that would later on
[54:07] rise up against what God had for them
[54:12] and that's what happens when we let our
[54:14] imagination get in the way our
[54:16] imagination will create something that
[54:19] will later on stand in the way of what
[54:21] God has for us
[54:23] and we know the story
[54:26] so he takes hey God has the baby this
[54:28] and that blah blah blah all that get out
[54:30] the way but he's still walking by faith
[54:33] and now he goes we know the patterns of
[54:36] his life and you know he has lot with
[54:38] him and all these different things and
[54:39] him a lot begin to clash and and you
[54:42] know and now he has to fight for lot now
[54:45] he has to go down and plead the blood
[54:47] Hallelujah the spiritual blood for lot
[54:50] all these things he's fighting because
[54:51] he's trying to maintain the promise of
[54:54] God walk before me and be thou perfect
[54:56] and he don't even understand how he's
[54:59] going to walk and be perfect because
[55:01] every step he meets Hallelujah seems
[55:04] like a battle every step he takes seems
[55:06] like he's losing but that's a part of
[55:09] his reality
[55:11] every step is making him Hallelujah the
[55:14] father of faith
[55:18] I hope you're catching the church
[55:20] Hallelujah so there are things you'll go
[55:22] through holy that you might not want to
[55:25] go through but it's producing your
[55:26] reality
[55:29] in our church Oh my he gets there and
[55:32] and and and he tells Sarah Hallelujah he
[55:36] says hey you're beautiful you're looking
[55:37] good grandma Hallelujah you're looking
[55:40] real good granny nobody can look like
[55:43] you look granny but you know what I want
[55:45] you to understand this they gonna kill
[55:47] me
[55:48] oh
[55:50] he's creating in his own reality
[55:54] by his imagination
[55:59] told him somebody gonna take your wife
[56:01] and I'm gonna have to fight for you
[56:05] God never told him that
[56:11] no worries
[56:12] but church God never told him that if we
[56:15] could look at it if we could dive into
[56:17] it what caused that King to take Sarah
[56:20] ham
[56:21] Abraham's what caused that King to take
[56:24] Sarah Abraham's
[56:26] imagination
[56:29] thank you brother
[56:32] he comes he says you're very beautiful
[56:34] the king want to kill me because they
[56:36] gonna want you so hey let's just change
[56:39] this for a second you're not my wife
[56:41] you're my sister
[56:43] and he tries to change what God made him
[56:48] but let me tell you something you ain't
[56:51] gonna mess it up
[56:52] God ain't gonna let you mess it up
[56:55] because if you could change God's word
[56:57] God would never speak it Hallelujah so
[57:00] God allowed you to go through something
[57:01] and look like you failed just so he
[57:03] could come on a scene and say prove me
[57:07] just so he could come on the scene and
[57:08] say I got this just so he could come on
[57:11] the scene and say I told you so just so
[57:13] he can come on and see he say if you
[57:16] only believe all things are possible
[57:19] so God will let us meet things that we
[57:21] can't control just so he can show you
[57:23] how I'm in control of it
[57:26] and that's the hardest part getting past
[57:29] our five senses
[57:32] because your five sixes are connected to
[57:35] What Fear
[57:39] now God
[57:41] to get Abraham to his reality
[57:44] he has to conquer his fears first
[57:50] in his own fears lies within who he is
[57:56] see Church
[57:57] he looks at the king
[57:59] and the whole Army of the king and
[58:01] everything the King has to offer and he
[58:03] says you know what I'm not able to come
[58:05] against us
[58:06] see his fears as in a way
[58:09] I can't beat this Army I can't do this
[58:11] and I can't that you know how we do when
[58:12] it comes to believing God first thing we
[58:14] say I don't make enough money
[58:16] I don't do this my prayer life ain't
[58:19] together I can't pray long enough I
[58:20] can't I can't I can
[58:24] and you're creating resistance
[58:29] you know what God want to do to us most
[58:31] of the time Matthew when we start going
[58:32] I can't just I can't just I'll tell you
[58:34] let's flash back the first time a person
[58:37] came to God and said I can't you know
[58:39] what God said shut up Moses
[58:42] who made your mouth now God's gonna tell
[58:45] him his reality who made your mouth who
[58:48] did this who did that he said you know
[58:50] what Moses do who you are you be God
[58:58] see God always elevates us higher than
[59:01] our imagination
[59:04] Moses is looking at himself in his five
[59:06] senses saying I'm not doesn't I'm not
[59:09] dead I can't talk and I did this and I
[59:11] did that God said shut up
[59:13] you are a god
[59:20] that's why Moses could stand before a
[59:23] raging seek
[59:26] and then he could create and speak
[59:29] Hallelujah things into existence
[59:32] that was not even there
[59:38] what was that
[59:40] that's God
[59:42] he says
[59:45] the Egyptians
[59:47] who've you've seen
[59:49] you shall see them no more
[59:54] forever
[59:57] now he's creating
[59:59] Hallelujah listen he didn't even speak
[1:00:03] to the Sea
[1:00:05] to see what the problem
[1:00:07] the problem was that the Egyptians who
[1:00:09] were chasing them Hallelujah so Moses
[1:00:12] speaks to his problem Hallelujah and by
[1:00:15] speaking to his problem the sea opens up
[1:00:17] and they walk to their reality
[1:00:21] maybe if you speak to the problem
[1:00:23] Hallelujah God will open up the way and
[1:00:25] then you can step into your reality
[1:00:27] Hallelujah
[1:00:30] glory to God
[1:00:32] but let's go back to Abraham Hallelujah
[1:00:35] now the king takes Sarah
[1:00:37] and he wants to wife her he wants to do
[1:00:40] the things that a husband does with his
[1:00:42] wife
[1:00:43] and then God steps in
[1:00:46] don't you love it when God step in
[1:00:48] you say oh god I've been praying for my
[1:00:50] bags leading the job for so long just
[1:00:52] keep praying
[1:00:55] don't accept what your eyes see
[1:00:58] church I'll be a witness if my mom
[1:01:01] accepted what her eyes saw in me I
[1:01:03] wouldn't be here
[1:01:05] but what she did she accepted the
[1:01:08] promise of God in Isaiah 55 or 54 one of
[1:01:11] the two Hallelujah God gave her a
[1:01:13] scripture and said to her all your
[1:01:15] children are going to come back to these
[1:01:17] borders
[1:01:18] Hallelujah and we were all doing
[1:01:21] different things Hallelujah but that
[1:01:22] promise became a reality
[1:01:25] all of us are in the kingdom of God now
[1:01:29] why because she didn't let Her
[1:01:30] Imagination overtake what God's word
[1:01:33] said
[1:01:35] don't let the the images your
[1:01:37] imaginations of your thoughts and your
[1:01:39] minds Hallelujah and your five senses go
[1:01:42] above what God has already said about
[1:01:44] you
[1:01:46] hey you know what helps me when it comes
[1:01:48] to these things like this God comes into
[1:01:51] Jeremiah 29 and he says for I know the
[1:01:55] thoughts I have towards you
[1:01:57] oh
[1:01:59] can somebody say Amen
[1:02:01] I ain't worried about what you think God
[1:02:03] says I know the thoughts I have
[1:02:05] concerning you Hallelujah God said he
[1:02:08] knows what he thinks about my journey
[1:02:10] but he thinks about my life what he
[1:02:12] thinks about my trial he said I got
[1:02:14] thoughts of peace and not of evil
[1:02:18] and you know what Diggs hallelujah what
[1:02:20] I'm thinking is going to bring you to an
[1:02:22] expected end
[1:02:27] God is looking for something out of you
[1:02:30] he's expecting it
[1:02:32] he's looking for what something real
[1:02:35] and you look at the whole journey of
[1:02:37] Abraham and Abraham see her Abraham
[1:02:40] battled to get to that walk of Faith to
[1:02:42] be the father fan
[1:02:43] all the way to the point to where he
[1:02:46] wouldn't deny anymore no matter what he
[1:02:48] was going through
[1:02:50] then God comes down and God confirms it
[1:02:53] God makes it and seals it a reality and
[1:02:56] he says now I know
[1:03:00] God cause Abraham he says now I know you
[1:03:02] love me now I know you fear me he said
[1:03:04] you know what Abraham I'ma never hide
[1:03:07] anything from you again
[1:03:09] we're gonna have a one-on-one and I'm
[1:03:11] gonna tell you the truth
[1:03:13] but then Abraham's seed Hallelujah
[1:03:15] starts off the same way he does
[1:03:20] oh my God Isaac picks up Hallelujah the
[1:03:23] same traits as Abraham line
[1:03:27] doing the same thing but that wasn't his
[1:03:29] reality
[1:03:32] his reality Hallelujah was Samina
[1:03:34] Rebecca Hallelujah who was chosen by the
[1:03:37] Eliza who was a servant of Abraham glory
[1:03:40] to God holy and all of that was carry on
[1:03:43] what the reality of the promise from
[1:03:45] Abraham
[1:03:47] and then you go from Isaac Hallelujah
[1:03:49] Isaac to Jacob looks like he picked up
[1:03:52] the same traits
[1:03:54] Jacob was a deceiver lying and cheating
[1:03:56] and lying to his daddy lying to
[1:03:58] everybody but that wasn't his reality
[1:04:03] don't look at your failures that's a
[1:04:05] part of it God's trying to get you to
[1:04:07] make steps of perfection and the only
[1:04:10] way you could be perfect first you have
[1:04:12] to have error
[1:04:15] you say brother these I got to have
[1:04:17] error yeah you didn't have ever how you
[1:04:19] know it's right
[1:04:22] I'd like to say to the young people that
[1:04:24] are sitting here
[1:04:27] you know what maybe you're excited about
[1:04:28] church today because it's a fellowship
[1:04:30] afterwards you're gonna eat good
[1:04:33] you're gonna drink good
[1:04:34] but there's a bigger picture
[1:04:37] I always say to the young people that
[1:04:39] most of us your parents and your adults
[1:04:41] here we've already been your crash
[1:04:43] dummies
[1:04:49] I've said this before you can take the
[1:04:52] finest car
[1:04:54] the the the most expensive car before
[1:04:58] they put it out there on the road they
[1:04:59] had to go through a crash test first
[1:05:03] three hundred thousand dollar Mercedes
[1:05:06] boom
[1:05:08] wreck up
[1:05:09] Smash Up
[1:05:11] but they didn't just smash it they put a
[1:05:14] body in it that would resemble you
[1:05:20] so that crash wasn't just a crash that
[1:05:23] crash had a purpose behind you that
[1:05:25] grass was to save some lives eventually
[1:05:28] that crash Hallelujah would prevent
[1:05:31] somebody from missing their reality so
[1:05:34] what God did Hallelujah just like that
[1:05:36] test he put some of us dummies
[1:05:38] Hallelujah and let us crash to prevent
[1:05:41] you from running into the same walls
[1:05:47] and it's amazing to me how the children
[1:05:49] think we don't know what we talking
[1:05:50] about look at me I got the scars of the
[1:05:53] accident
[1:05:56] we have the scars of the accident
[1:06:00] but we take some of our sons who are uh
[1:06:03] most of our kids grow up to be our boys
[1:06:06] grew up to be taller than us
[1:06:09] no thank you something special you just
[1:06:12] got more pesticides than you
[1:06:18] it's causing you to grow a little bit
[1:06:21] extra
[1:06:23] you just got more steroids in you
[1:06:28] be careful with this stuff
[1:06:30] because Church even now Holly you know
[1:06:33] that steroids is considered in the in
[1:06:35] the in the the the performance the
[1:06:38] performance era to be illegal
[1:06:41] but when you go to the doctor and you
[1:06:43] have a pain where they give you steroids
[1:06:47] if it's illegal for them why should it
[1:06:50] be okay for me
[1:06:53] sisters you come and say honey how do I
[1:06:55] look I feel like I'm gaining weight
[1:06:58] you just say honey stop taking them
[1:07:00] steroids and you won't feel like that
[1:07:04] that's what it's doing is pushing out in
[1:07:06] areas that don't need to be seen
[1:07:09] and that's normally what the devil does
[1:07:11] he tries to get you to push out in areas
[1:07:13] that don't need to be seen
[1:07:15] hold on let me get off of that
[1:07:19] but church if you take it and you look
[1:07:21] at the examples of the scriptures you
[1:07:23] get to Jacob and Jacob Hurley look like
[1:07:25] his life was a mess
[1:07:27] but that was a part of his reality
[1:07:29] remember the Seed of Abraham has to walk
[1:07:32] before God and be thou perfect
[1:07:35] so there may be a lot of trial and error
[1:07:38] in that walk but the end of it is the
[1:07:41] reality of perfection
[1:07:43] that's why all the other Brides all the
[1:07:46] other churches had to fail so we could
[1:07:48] get in position
[1:07:49] Hallelujah why because this church is
[1:07:52] going to walk into perfection
[1:07:54] this church is going to walk into a body
[1:07:57] take oh
[1:07:59] yeah and then we got scriptures that
[1:08:01] speaks of our reality and it says ye
[1:08:04] shall not all sleep
[1:08:07] some of us are going to be well aware of
[1:08:09] what's taking place we're going to be
[1:08:12] well aware looking at this message and
[1:08:14] all these things that are prophesied
[1:08:16] coming to pass Church what are we we're
[1:08:18] walking by perfection
[1:08:23] how many of you feel this way it doesn't
[1:08:25] matter who the president is whatever God
[1:08:27] says is going to happen it's going to
[1:08:29] happen
[1:08:33] if I can hit this real quick don't get
[1:08:34] caught up in Democrats and Republicans
[1:08:36] and all that nonsense
[1:08:40] well well you don't vote you can't make
[1:08:43] a change the changes in the word of God
[1:08:50] now you can do what you want to do you
[1:08:52] know I ain't tell nobody not to vote
[1:08:54] but I didn't already cast my vote
[1:08:57] and it's the same every year
[1:09:02] hallelujah it's the same every year
[1:09:04] because I know earlier his legislation
[1:09:07] is not going to change
[1:09:09] Holly I know what he stands for what he
[1:09:11] believes earlier is not going to change
[1:09:13] when he's under pressure
[1:09:16] he's not going to succumb to the
[1:09:18] pressure of the people trying to put on
[1:09:19] but Jesus Christ Remains the same
[1:09:21] yesterday today and forever that's my
[1:09:24] reality
[1:09:26] and no matter how many laws they changed
[1:09:29] how many laws they create how many
[1:09:31] things they make up Hallelujah the
[1:09:33] reality of the Believers stays the same
[1:09:39] but if your hope isn't biting I feel
[1:09:42] sorry for you
[1:09:47] if your hope is in Trump I feel even
[1:09:49] more sorry for you
[1:09:54] let me let me move on
[1:09:58] oh my
[1:09:59] God cause I know people get caught up in
[1:10:01] this what's happening your imagination
[1:10:03] because the word of God has already told
[1:10:05] us hallelujah who's going to take over
[1:10:07] everything we have a word hallelujah
[1:10:10] that shows us our reality that the
[1:10:12] United States is going to fail and
[1:10:14] everything they're going to fall under
[1:10:16] debt like they are right now trillions
[1:10:19] and trillions and trillions of dollars
[1:10:21] behind and they're trying to negotiate
[1:10:23] what they should do with the debt
[1:10:28] when we already know what's going to
[1:10:30] happen see we're living in a reality of
[1:10:33] faith
[1:10:36] this thing is so real to us we can walk
[1:10:39] right up to the pope and say I Know Who
[1:10:41] You Are
[1:10:45] you can call yourself Francis Benedict
[1:10:47] Arnold whatever you want to call
[1:10:48] yourself but I call you the mark of the
[1:10:51] beast
[1:10:52] I know who you are I know what you're
[1:10:55] gonna do you I know what you're gonna do
[1:10:57] before you do it and if you don't do it
[1:10:59] I know what your success is gonna just
[1:11:00] yeah
[1:11:01] why because the word of God tells me so
[1:11:03] that's my reality Church what he told
[1:11:06] Abraham I will hide nothing from you
[1:11:11] Hallelujah there's not anything going on
[1:11:14] church that we don't know about that's
[1:11:16] who we are that's our reality well let's
[1:11:19] look at it a little bit more there was a
[1:11:21] prophet in Israel who knew what was
[1:11:22] going on in the other parts of the land
[1:11:26] Hallelujah
[1:11:29] sold it to a prophet already
[1:11:36] and if you say well brother brother D
[1:11:38] that was just a prophet well who pointed
[1:11:40] him to the prophet it was a hands made
[1:11:43] it was a little made down there who say
[1:11:45] I know there's a man down there who can
[1:11:47] tell you what you stand in need of
[1:11:50] Hallelujah
[1:11:52] let's keep moving
[1:11:53] I'm about to close don't get nervous
[1:11:57] reality also means
[1:12:00] resemblance to what is real
[1:12:03] resemblance to what is real that word
[1:12:07] resemblance can be kind of tricky
[1:12:10] because we have a word of resemblance
[1:12:14] where it says the two will be so close
[1:12:18] that it can deceive the very elected if
[1:12:21] possible
[1:12:23] so that means that there's something out
[1:12:25] there that resembles my reality
[1:12:32] what's the difference between
[1:12:34] them and me
[1:12:36] I have to live it
[1:12:39] you have to live it
[1:12:41] and as you live it it becomes more and
[1:12:44] more real
[1:12:47] see you're not really a wife when you
[1:12:50] say I do
[1:12:54] you say what you mean I said I do I'm a
[1:12:57] wife I didn't sign a certificate no
[1:12:59] there's a definition behind wife
[1:13:02] there's certain characteristics that
[1:13:04] come along with that Hallelujah all
[1:13:06] right well you're not really a husband
[1:13:08] just because that paper says you're the
[1:13:10] husband of
[1:13:12] what makes your husband your
[1:13:14] characteristics
[1:13:15] Hallelujah cause you can say your
[1:13:17] husband and your character says you're a
[1:13:20] bum
[1:13:24] grass need to be cut
[1:13:27] wife tire flat
[1:13:32] all kind of stuff that a husband is
[1:13:34] supposed to be taking care of
[1:13:37] but you say honey I work I work I'll
[1:13:40] take care of them
[1:13:44] let's look at this because look at the
[1:13:46] reality of it what's the reality of it
[1:13:50] Sarah called Abraham Lord
[1:13:52] why because that's what she saw
[1:13:56] earlier that's what he manifest
[1:14:00] I know a sister brother was preaching I
[1:14:02] ain't gonna say the name he was
[1:14:03] preaching and he started yeah what he's
[1:14:05] called Abraham Sarah call Abraham Lord
[1:14:08] he said honey you heard that when we got
[1:14:10] out of church he said no I'm gonna call
[1:14:11] you by your first name
[1:14:14] let's just say his name was Patrick your
[1:14:16] name Patrick bro
[1:14:19] ain't no lawyer going on up in here
[1:14:24] you say oh brother D's you cutting up no
[1:14:26] the only way that men can be Lord is if
[1:14:29] she makes you Lord
[1:14:32] you say oh my that's that's kind of
[1:14:34] heavy brother Dix Hallelujah well how
[1:14:36] did Jesus Christ become Lord we made him
[1:14:38] Lord
[1:14:40] Hallelujah because there were people who
[1:14:43] saw him and called him bl's above
[1:14:45] holy so it's a revelation of him that
[1:14:48] makes him who he is and my reality is
[1:14:51] he's my Lord my reality is He's My
[1:14:54] Savior My reality is He's My All In All
[1:14:57] That's My Reality
[1:15:01] I'll see you back there Auntie praise
[1:15:03] God Church
[1:15:06] but if we look
[1:15:07] at the seat of Abraham it looked like it
[1:15:10] was getting away from his reality but no
[1:15:11] he was walking to it
[1:15:13] every form of that seed had trial and
[1:15:16] tribulation now we start with Jacob at
[1:15:19] the end of his battle Jacob got to a
[1:15:22] place of panel where he had to wrestle
[1:15:24] with God
[1:15:27] so you mean all at trial all them lies
[1:15:30] all the stuff he ever did all those
[1:15:32] babies was just to get him to that point
[1:15:37] the reality of being called a prince
[1:15:41] the reality with everyone would know
[1:15:43] that he's no longer a Jacob
[1:15:46] but he's a prince called of God
[1:15:48] God even changed his name
[1:15:50] we're not calling you Israel no more I
[1:15:52] mean we're not calling you Jacob anymore
[1:15:53] your name now is Israel
[1:15:56] that was his reality
[1:15:58] when he was mixing up the the cattle and
[1:16:00] and when he was putting Harley a fur on
[1:16:03] his arms
[1:16:05] boy that boy went to the extreme
[1:16:09] to get what his heart desired
[1:16:15] I wonder what you would do to see the
[1:16:18] Promise fulfilled in your life
[1:16:20] because remember all the trickery and
[1:16:22] all the things Jacob did in that moment
[1:16:24] was just to receive the blessing
[1:16:28] yes but in church
[1:16:30] if we
[1:16:32] go past Jacob
[1:16:34] and we go to Joseph
[1:16:36] more what era more trial more
[1:16:39] tribulation only to get him where to
[1:16:45] he was lied on
[1:16:49] his brothers was envious of them they
[1:16:51] hated his guts
[1:16:55] they hated his guts
[1:16:57] see the law of contrast
[1:16:59] and I say this all the time you say we
[1:17:01] don't hear much about saying Lord please
[1:17:03] give me perfect love
[1:17:05] you be careful
[1:17:07] perfect love is the only thing gonna be
[1:17:09] there right
[1:17:10] Lord please give me perfect Lord I need
[1:17:13] perfectly oh Lord please I need perfect
[1:17:15] love be careful
[1:17:17] because the only way you're gonna get
[1:17:18] this you experience perfect hatred
[1:17:24] and that ain't gonna happen that hatred
[1:17:26] ain't gonna come from a stranger because
[1:17:27] it wouldn't affect you
[1:17:29] Your Love wouldn't be tested
[1:17:32] it may have to be if we look at the
[1:17:35] Bible it may have to come from a family
[1:17:37] member
[1:17:40] it may come from somebody out of your
[1:17:42] same household out of the same church
[1:17:44] somebody that you worship with somebody
[1:17:46] who's supposed to know what you believe
[1:17:48] and now they hate your gut so much the
[1:17:50] way they ready to get rid of you
[1:17:54] they hate you so much Hallelujah so
[1:17:56] they're willing to lie on you
[1:18:00] so they're willing to allow you to be
[1:18:02] put in jail
[1:18:05] those are all the things Jacob went
[1:18:07] through just to get to his reality
[1:18:10] oh my and when he got there hallelujah
[1:18:13] what was it it was to run the whole
[1:18:15] country
[1:18:16] it was to show his brothers everything
[1:18:18] you did was just to get me here
[1:18:21] and that's a man who's appreciative of
[1:18:23] his reality and then he could look back
[1:18:25] at his brothers with No Malice no hurt
[1:18:28] no pain and say hey what y'all thought
[1:18:30] y'all meant for evil God worked it out
[1:18:33] for my good and he said look y'all don't
[1:18:35] have to tell me lies that Daddy said you
[1:18:38] know don't hurt y'all he's I ain't
[1:18:39] worried about none of that what y'all
[1:18:41] did y'all were supposed to do and then
[1:18:42] he comes and he said to them and I love
[1:18:44] to say this to people in the action hey
[1:18:46] brother how you doing everything good I
[1:18:47] said am I not in the place of God
[1:18:52] that's what Joseph said
[1:18:54] his brothers they're worried about their
[1:18:56] life and all the things that have taken
[1:18:57] place Joseph says to them am I not in
[1:19:01] the place of God
[1:19:02] is this not what God had for me even in
[1:19:05] all the wrong y'all did
[1:19:10] let's be careful who we give the credit
[1:19:12] to
[1:19:15] too often we go through things and God
[1:19:17] is making us walk before him and be thou
[1:19:19] perfect first little trial this ain't
[1:19:22] nothing but the devil
[1:19:24] you the devil
[1:19:30] we give the devil too much credit
[1:19:33] only thing he can do is what God allows
[1:19:37] only Power he has is what we confess to
[1:19:39] him
[1:19:42] by your imagination and your five senses
[1:19:45] you give the devil control of situations
[1:19:47] that don't belong to him
[1:19:53] I feel like I'm coming down with a Y2K
[1:19:57] flu
[1:19:59] be making up stuff
[1:20:02] and I ain't got nothing against doctors
[1:20:04] and and nurses and everything but why
[1:20:07] can't never be a simple name
[1:20:11] got to be something never heard of
[1:20:14] something never thought of because it
[1:20:16] has to look like something that you
[1:20:17] can't control
[1:20:20] you have herbal Simplex 97 by eight
[1:20:24] tenths
[1:20:26] huh
[1:20:28] I got what
[1:20:31] and because you've never heard it before
[1:20:32] your imagination takes over
[1:20:35] oh my God I have that oh Lord oh Father
[1:20:38] please let me oh I need prayer no
[1:20:42] you just need to say that's not my
[1:20:44] reality
[1:20:47] you might see something under your scope
[1:20:49] but my words see something else it says
[1:20:51] by your stripes I'm Healed
[1:20:54] but God is God is so great church this
[1:20:57] is what I want you to understand God is
[1:20:59] so great he'll even allow the doctor to
[1:21:02] see the bruise cells
[1:21:08] the cedar Bruce cells just to let your
[1:21:11] confession vanish in a way
[1:21:15] Hallelujah
[1:21:17] I believe and know it to be true
[1:21:24] but church if we wind this on down
[1:21:27] everybody all right
[1:21:29] I got about two more I'm about to close
[1:21:32] church if we look if we go back to the
[1:21:34] text scriptures
[1:21:36] of the Chisholm of Israel
[1:21:38] in the land now
[1:21:41] let's understand this
[1:21:43] when they came and saw those grapes
[1:21:46] they were in the land of the promise
[1:21:49] they were in their reality
[1:21:55] but they let the thoughts of their
[1:21:56] imagination take them out of the land
[1:22:00] and not want to go back in the land
[1:22:03] when God gave them the promise of the
[1:22:05] evidence
[1:22:06] and look Church they said the grace was
[1:22:09] so big it took two of them to take them
[1:22:11] back
[1:22:12] you know why because they were giants
[1:22:15] eating Those Grapes
[1:22:17] and when you go back and read the church
[1:22:19] the Bible said after 40 days they
[1:22:22] returned so they were already in the
[1:22:24] land for 40 days
[1:22:26] and the Giants didn't do nothing to them
[1:22:28] then
[1:22:29] so what made them think that they could
[1:22:31] live in the land
[1:22:33] there
[1:22:34] say it with me
[1:22:38] they were already in the land they
[1:22:41] already came and tasted up the land had
[1:22:43] the evidence of the land walked out of
[1:22:45] the land came back to Moses and said
[1:22:46] Moses this is the promise of what God
[1:22:49] Said
[1:22:50] what kind of sense that me
[1:22:52] you're confirming what God Said and then
[1:22:55] you're going to say I don't believe it
[1:22:57] foreign
[1:22:59] that's crazy that's somebody who who
[1:23:02] needs a 5150 session
[1:23:08] y'all may not know what that mean that
[1:23:09] means psychiatric help
[1:23:15] they need a classic Kanye West section
[1:23:22] somebody who got so much to offer but
[1:23:24] don't know what to do with it
[1:23:27] Church
[1:23:28] they have the evidence they come back to
[1:23:31] Moses and say hey they say they come
[1:23:33] back to Joshua and say look this this is
[1:23:34] it right here we got it this is it right
[1:23:36] here everything God surely the land is
[1:23:39] their words the land is Flowing with
[1:23:42] milk and honey like God said like God
[1:23:45] promised
[1:23:46] now I don't know about y'all but that
[1:23:48] would that would have charged me up for
[1:23:51] war
[1:23:53] they would have stopped calling me
[1:23:55] brother D's and start calling me Rambo
[1:24:00] because whatever weapons I had to my uh
[1:24:02] uh it was in my reach I would have
[1:24:05] started loading up
[1:24:06] no matter how big the giant look and
[1:24:08] they say and the sons of anak were there
[1:24:10] who cares
[1:24:12] if God allowed me to taste of the fruit
[1:24:15] that mean it was mine
[1:24:18] that's my reality they were holding
[1:24:20] their reality they were tasting their
[1:24:22] reality and let their imagination walk
[1:24:25] them away from me
[1:24:30] don't let your own desires of unbelief
[1:24:34] get in the way of your truth
[1:24:39] so Church
[1:24:41] they say we don't want to go
[1:24:45] and then Moses I mean Joshua tries to
[1:24:47] get the people Joshua Caleb as if God
[1:24:49] delighted us we're more than able
[1:24:51] instead of giant in their land we don't
[1:24:53] want to go and this and that and they
[1:24:54] complain and complain and complain and
[1:24:56] God got to the place
[1:24:57] don't worry
[1:24:59] I I give somebody else your blessing
[1:25:04] but it didn't change
[1:25:06] two people's reality
[1:25:10] no matter how many peoples walked away
[1:25:12] from this truth
[1:25:13] don't let it change your reality
[1:25:17] because there is a bride
[1:25:19] Hallelujah
[1:25:20] that's being washed By the Waters of
[1:25:22] separation
[1:25:24] there is a bride who knows she has thus
[1:25:26] said the Lord there is a bride
[1:25:29] Hallelujah that believes in Revelations
[1:25:31] 10 Hallelujah Hallelujah you think I'm
[1:25:34] talking about seven no I'm talking about
[1:25:35] one
[1:25:37] Revelation 10 1 another Mighty angel
[1:25:40] came down Hallelujah he started the
[1:25:43] whole thing
[1:25:44] God came down and started the whole
[1:25:46] thing Hallelujah he dealt with the
[1:25:48] prophet and he also dealt with the bride
[1:25:50] starting at the eighth verse
[1:25:53] Hallelujah so we're all a part of the
[1:25:55] reality of God coming down
[1:25:58] because when he came down he dealt with
[1:26:00] us as one Hallelujah
[1:26:03] because he didn't change books the book
[1:26:05] that he gave the prophet Hallelujah he
[1:26:07] passed over to us
[1:26:09] so we have the same reality as Malachi
[1:26:11] 4.
[1:26:13] Hallelujah I'll give you another
[1:26:15] scripture for that one how do you say
[1:26:16] they that receive a prophet in the name
[1:26:18] of a prophet have a prophets what
[1:26:19] Rewards
[1:26:21] did God comes Hallelujah to the prophet
[1:26:23] it says because you chose this way which
[1:26:26] is the harder way there's a large
[1:26:27] portion of what happened
[1:26:30] that awaits you Hallelujah so if I chose
[1:26:33] the same way he chose that means there's
[1:26:35] a large portion of Heaven that awaits me
[1:26:38] also
[1:26:41] Hallelujah
[1:26:43] don't try to change my reality by
[1:26:46] putting it on a man no we saw God
[1:26:52] because if you put it back on a man
[1:26:53] you're still living in your five senses
[1:26:58] Hallelujah
[1:27:00] but Church
[1:27:02] in closing
[1:27:08] Abraham
[1:27:10] the Bible says
[1:27:13] who believed in Hope
[1:27:16] he believed in things that he couldn't
[1:27:19] see as though they were
[1:27:23] that's who we are
[1:27:26] everything you stand in need of
[1:27:28] your eyes may not declare it
[1:27:31] your ears may not declare it
[1:27:33] your sins of touch may not declare it
[1:27:36] but the prophet of God says your faith
[1:27:38] can go get it
[1:27:40] make it happen
[1:27:42] grab a hold of it bring it back to you
[1:27:44] and make it a reality
[1:27:48] Hallelujah
[1:27:50] and that's what it did for Abraham
[1:27:52] Harley
[1:27:53] and the Bible says he staggered not
[1:27:56] oh
[1:27:57] that means that all the things he was
[1:27:59] going through King elimelech trying to
[1:28:02] get his wife he stagger not
[1:28:05] fighting for lot all those kings he
[1:28:08] staggered not
[1:28:10] and we can go on and on and on and on
[1:28:13] but that Seed of Abraham staggered not
[1:28:16] at the promises of God
[1:28:19] you say Brothers I'm going through
[1:28:21] something real tough you're not
[1:28:22] staggering you're believing
[1:28:25] Hallelujah because if you wouldn't
[1:28:27] believe in you if you didn't gave up by
[1:28:29] now
[1:28:30] because I don't know if you really
[1:28:32] realize the trials in our day and how
[1:28:34] how are a lot more tougher
[1:28:38] a lot more harder to believe that God is
[1:28:41] on our side
[1:28:44] people have decided to come against the
[1:28:47] very thing that you believe
[1:28:49] they know how you worship they know what
[1:28:51] you worship who you worship where it
[1:28:53] came from and all that and come back and
[1:28:55] say I did it with you once upon a time
[1:28:57] so I know it ain't real
[1:29:01] don't let that change your reality
[1:29:04] damn that
[1:29:07] because when it all boils down to
[1:29:09] Hallelujah
[1:29:11] if we look at the reality of the Saints
[1:29:13] and different things that took place in
[1:29:15] that moment it didn't look like God was
[1:29:17] doing something but there was a reality
[1:29:18] coming forth remember Lazarus died but
[1:29:22] before he died the Bible says God loved
[1:29:24] him
[1:29:26] Hallelujah so you think death was going
[1:29:29] to change God's love no death Hollywood
[1:29:32] was going to bring the love of God to
[1:29:34] him
[1:29:35] so Dev Hallelujah was the reality of
[1:29:38] bringing love down whoa
[1:29:41] oh Hallelujah so Lazarus Hallelujah real
[1:29:44] reality of death was what proving the
[1:29:46] resurrection
[1:29:48] then God called he says Lazarus come
[1:29:50] forth God allowed death to show The
[1:29:53] Resurrection
[1:29:54] oh my and as we look at other things and
[1:29:56] we say God brought Moses on the scene
[1:29:58] what was his reality Deliverance
[1:30:02] and all that walk with Moses experienced
[1:30:04] the reality of Deliverance if we take
[1:30:07] Abraham his reality was Jehovah Jireh
[1:30:10] holy God shall provides for himself
[1:30:14] let me tell you a story real quick
[1:30:16] before I get out the way friend of mine
[1:30:19] he's been here in Arizona brother Robson
[1:30:22] Steve Robson
[1:30:24] I was speaking for him and before I
[1:30:27] spoke for him that weekend before he
[1:30:28] went deer hunting
[1:30:30] and you know he loved a good hunt
[1:30:33] he said he was out there hunting
[1:30:35] he had to crossbows on about four doors
[1:30:39] but in his heart he said I want a buck
[1:30:44] I didn't come out here to shoot no dose
[1:30:46] he said but they were standing there and
[1:30:49] it was a tree not a big tree but it was
[1:30:51] a tree
[1:30:52] he said they kept going back and forth
[1:30:54] past the tree back and forth he's
[1:30:55] sitting there in the grass watching
[1:30:57] and in his heart he said I want a buck
[1:31:00] I want a buck
[1:31:02] Church there may be something in your
[1:31:04] heart hallelujah it's just marinade I
[1:31:07] won't
[1:31:08] I won't I won't but what you gonna do
[1:31:10] about it
[1:31:11] you're gonna leave it there
[1:31:14] oh you're gonna speak it
[1:31:18] and that's what Steve did he say he said
[1:31:20] the bus was walking back and forth by
[1:31:22] the tree and he said he said I know a
[1:31:25] bucket somewhere
[1:31:27] so you know what I'm gonna do I'm gonna
[1:31:28] speak it out
[1:31:30] so while he was laying there oh he could
[1:31:32] see was four bucks and he said he stood
[1:31:35] up you know when you stand up they run
[1:31:37] he said he stood up and yelled hey buck
[1:31:46] as long as he said that as long as he
[1:31:48] kept the scope there there never was a
[1:31:49] book but as soon as he called it by name
[1:31:52] it appeared
[1:31:57] as soon as he said hey Buck the buck
[1:32:00] came from out of nowhere and now it's in
[1:32:03] his scope so you know what it wasn't a
[1:32:05] vision he shot
[1:32:07] and if I would have stayed around a
[1:32:09] little bit longer I would have had some
[1:32:10] of that meat
[1:32:12] I love spoken word meat
[1:32:15] Hallelujah
[1:32:17] that's some of the best meat earlier
[1:32:20] that mean they ain't got no heartburn to
[1:32:22] it Hallelujah that meat ain't got no
[1:32:25] pesticides connected to it it's fresh it
[1:32:28] came fresh out of the mouth of a
[1:32:30] believer
[1:32:31] so all they could do is produce Joy
[1:32:35] and all of a sudden a big a big buck
[1:32:38] came out
[1:32:39] where was it
[1:32:41] it was always there he just had to speak
[1:32:43] it just like Father Abraham
[1:32:51] you tell a testimony like that and and
[1:32:52] most of all you're like
[1:32:59] church if it happened for Steve
[1:33:03] it can happen for you
[1:33:07] you just need to call it out in faith
[1:33:10] don't let your imagination say it's not
[1:33:13] there
[1:33:14] you put it there the prophet of God is a
[1:33:17] real faith will put it there remember
[1:33:19] you talking about the knife in his
[1:33:20] pocket he said if I leave it on the
[1:33:22] dresser if I need it I'll put it in my
[1:33:23] pocket
[1:33:25] and we didn't heard all these stories
[1:33:26] about communion and they ran out of wine
[1:33:28] and he prayed Hallelujah in a wine
[1:33:31] appear
[1:33:33] I know a brother Hallelujah named Floyd
[1:33:36] Jenkins I don't know if Floyd's still
[1:33:37] alive but he was in the tabernacle
[1:33:39] during those days of older brother he
[1:33:41] said the anointing was so strong in
[1:33:44] Church Holy when the anointing came down
[1:33:46] and everybody stood up he said the first
[1:33:48] three rows of chairs were levitable
[1:33:54] now some of y'all are like really
[1:33:58] if the devil could make a pumpkin float
[1:34:01] you don't think God can make
[1:34:03] floating the presence of faith
[1:34:07] or make a gas float witchcraft can make
[1:34:10] a death float
[1:34:13] see the things when it comes to God we
[1:34:15] let this get in the way
[1:34:21] the woman with the blood issue her
[1:34:23] reality was healing
[1:34:25] rahab's reality was what not
[1:34:27] prostitution it was salvation
[1:34:30] Hallelujah
[1:34:31] oh my you look at you say she had a bad
[1:34:34] life and all these things it was just to
[1:34:37] get her to the place where she could
[1:34:38] meet salvation
[1:34:40] oh my you say Brothers I'm going through
[1:34:43] a tough time God's trying to bring you
[1:34:45] to your reality
[1:34:49] and once she met up with that her life
[1:34:51] was changed forever
[1:34:52] she didn't even know that she was in the
[1:34:55] lineage of the most high God she didn't
[1:34:57] even know that she was going to produce
[1:34:59] a type of Christ and Boaz
[1:35:03] but that was her reality
[1:35:05] her reality wasn't Jericho
[1:35:08] because when God destroyed Jericho he
[1:35:11] destroyed all of the past
[1:35:17] in my closing
[1:35:20] remember that woman in Memphis Tennessee
[1:35:24] her son was sick come on musicians
[1:35:28] her son was sick
[1:35:30] and she raised him
[1:35:32] in a Christian environment
[1:35:34] now what is God doing he's testing her
[1:35:37] faith
[1:35:39] not only is he testing her faith
[1:35:42] he's showing her
[1:35:44] that she's really scripturally placed
[1:35:49] he's showing her
[1:35:52] that these characters in the Bible is
[1:35:55] exactly who you are
[1:35:59] and her son is singer she said Lord I
[1:36:02] can't let my baby die like this
[1:36:04] I can't not the daughters can't not
[1:36:06] medicine I can't let my baby die see
[1:36:08] she's speaking with authority now
[1:36:10] she's back to Genesis 1 26. she's
[1:36:13] speaking with authority having dominion
[1:36:15] over everything I can't let my boy die
[1:36:17] like this so she goes into prayer
[1:36:19] Hallelujah God gives us a dream and she
[1:36:21] before she started praying she says Lord
[1:36:24] I'm just like that shooting Mike
[1:36:28] and if I'm the pseudomite the reality of
[1:36:32] that scripture is there has to be an
[1:36:33] Elijah on this Earth let me ask you
[1:36:36] something who are you
[1:36:37] if you find yourself in the scripture
[1:36:39] where's the rest of it
[1:36:44] all right it has to be here
[1:36:48] if God gave you a promise the rest of
[1:36:51] that promise has to be here
[1:36:53] and the suit of my says she said the
[1:36:55] Auntie she says if I'm Hallelujah the
[1:36:58] shooter might do where's my Elijah
[1:37:00] Elijah was on the plane didn't even know
[1:37:01] what was going on but he was connected
[1:37:03] to what her face
[1:37:06] faith has its own reality
[1:37:10] in her faith Hallelujah changed the
[1:37:13] travels of a prophet
[1:37:16] just like it did in the Bible Hallelujah
[1:37:19] remember Jesus was going down to the
[1:37:22] service house Hallelujah he was going
[1:37:24] down there to to help the servant of the
[1:37:27] Centurion Hallelujah but then there was
[1:37:30] a woman believing
[1:37:33] and Jesus had to deal with her faith on
[1:37:35] his way down there
[1:37:37] and the prophet was going some way
[1:37:39] Hallelujah but God needed that gift holy
[1:37:42] to stop off in Memphis Tennessee and the
[1:37:44] only way he could stop there was through
[1:37:46] the reality of faith
[1:37:49] he's still the same God
[1:37:53] he's still here today
[1:37:56] her reality was salvation for her son
[1:38:00] life can seem tough but Lord let the
[1:38:03] devil dictate your end or your outcome
[1:38:07] Hallelujah
[1:38:08] you've been going through it ain't been
[1:38:10] 25 years yet keep pressing you ain't got
[1:38:12] no reason to complain yet
[1:38:14] because Abraham was 25 years Hallelujah
[1:38:17] and even if he hit 26 that don't mean
[1:38:20] God's promises change
[1:38:22] maybe you are going to be the one to
[1:38:24] rewrite history
[1:38:26] Hallelujah
[1:38:27] let's pray let's pray
[1:38:30] Hallelujah
[1:38:32] y'all playing touching Jesus
[1:38:37] let's go let's pray Lord Jesus father we

[1:38:42] your mercy Lord and all the things that

[1:38:46] Lord and even right now we want to live
[1:38:47] in the reality of Faith Lord
[1:38:50] Faith controlling everything in our life

[1:41:30] want to touch you this morning here's
[1:41:33] what you got to do there's only one way
[1:41:36] [Music]
[1:41:39] to touch
[1:41:43] oh just really
[1:41:46] [Music]

[1:42:04] [Music]
[1:42:17] there is only
[1:42:21] one way
[1:42:25] [Music]
[1:42:31] when you call
[1:42:34] his name
[1:42:39] did you appreciate the word of the Lord
[1:42:41] amen this morning you know faith is a I
[1:42:44] thought about brother Diggs as he was
[1:42:45] just speaking there and I thought about
[1:42:47] Jesus when he was touched by that woman
[1:42:50] who had that blood issue and the prophet
[1:42:52] of God says that the father had shown
[1:42:54] him everything but that little woman the
[1:42:57] Lord he said the father didn't show
[1:42:58] Jesus that but he said actually that
[1:43:01] woman by her need operated the gift
[1:43:04] inside of the Son of God and she reached
[1:43:08] out with faith and Drew out from the
[1:43:11] Lord what she needed
[1:43:12] now I believe that if that little woman
[1:43:14] could have an issue how many here would
[1:43:16] say Lord I've got something I need to
[1:43:18] reach out and touch the Lord Jesus you
[1:43:20] know faith is beyond human reasoning you
[1:43:23] heard brother Diggs Preach Today and you
[1:43:25] might say well that just sounds
[1:43:27] unreasonable you know brother Brandon
[1:43:28] says in 1962 in the countdown he's
[1:43:31] talking about that astronaut now it's
[1:43:33] easy for us now we've had astronauts
[1:43:36] John Glenn starting with John Glenn
[1:43:38] we've had astronauts and NASA missions
[1:43:40] go to outer space we've got a telescope
[1:43:42] that'll send us back images but put
[1:43:45] yourself in the shoes of a person before
[1:43:48] and prior to any of that Discovery and
[1:43:51] for someone to say you know what there's
[1:43:52] something beyond what we see there's
[1:43:54] something beyond what were our five
[1:43:57] senses can touch brother Brandon said to
[1:43:58] that that and that first astronaut and
[1:44:01] he said he had to have he had to look
[1:44:03] Beyond his own space
[1:44:07] to look to what's out of his space and
[1:44:10] brother Brandon says faith doesn't lay
[1:44:12] within this space Faith looks beyond
[1:44:15] into an outer space
[1:44:17] into something that's beyond what you
[1:44:20] see you might have a need in your body
[1:44:21] and I know we got needs here amongst us
[1:44:24] today and we got brother Diggs here and
[1:44:25] we're not just going to rush to close
[1:44:27] this service out I believe the Lord
[1:44:29] inspired brother Diggs and put a thought
[1:44:31] upon his heart amen and maybe if you had
[1:44:33] a need maybe something upon your heart
[1:44:35] you just want to uh brother Jack wants a
[1:44:38] prayer cloth we're going to do that

[1:44:41] would have a need amen here this morning
[1:44:43] we're going to have the anointed vessel
[1:44:44] of God Amen come and lay hands on you
[1:44:47] and pray for you Amen brother Brandon
[1:44:49] says God's not looking for horse and
[1:44:51] buggy drivers
[1:44:53] he's looking for astronauts
[1:44:55] someone that'll something that'll go
[1:44:57] beyond what your human senses can touch
[1:45:00] amen and Reach Out And Touch the Lord
