[0:00] wise fear the lord and depart from evil
[0:04] and i thank god that i'm able to eat
[0:08] from the lord's table my mind
[0:11] ever since 1984 and this 2020.
[0:16] and let me tell you what this food
[0:19] is never got spar to me
[0:23] brothers give me peace and since i've
[0:25] been eating this
[0:26] it made me love my wife more it made me
[0:30] do
[0:30] things for my wife that perhaps i
[0:33] probably wouldn't have been doing but so
[0:34] happened by the grace of god
[0:36] i'm eating from the lord's table when
[0:39] the bible tells me from the lord's table
[0:41] the bible said husband love your wife
[0:44] even that christ loved the church and
[0:47] gave himself for it
[0:48] i thank god i'm able to eat
[0:51] from the lord's table i'm going to ask
[0:54] you tonight
[0:56] are you eating from the lord's table

[1:47] somebody hard
[1:49] and i believe there's a verbal warning

[9:07] i just tell a quick testimony
[9:10] i went and speak at brother scott from
[9:13] lower uh lenoir north carolina
[9:17] and covert 19 had struck that church
[9:21] about 80 percent it got so bad until
[9:23] they had to spray the whole entire
[9:25] church
[9:26] well that particular sunday we was
[9:28] ministering there
[9:29] and the lord was really moving in a
[9:31] mighty way i still believe that god's
[9:33] still a healer
[9:34] i told the church the same lord jesus
[9:36] that was with william branham
[9:38] william branham has gone into that
[9:40] dimension but the holy spirit is still
[9:42] here
[9:43] but you got to get the people to believe
[9:45] not even cancer
[9:46] so he was preaching on that level and
[9:49] there was a sister
[9:50] that she couldn't breathe the type of
[9:53] the cover 19.
[9:55] and she said as i was ministering and
[9:57] when i walked on the floor
[9:59] she said her whole body began to shook
[10:01] and she said god
[10:02] healed her right then and there and
[10:05] there's another sister came
[10:06] up because i was telling the story about
[10:08] brother elvin's car you know this story
[10:10] brother browner told in 1962
[10:12] brother elvin's call was stolen how
[10:14] brother browner prayed
[10:16] and he used matthew the 18th chapter and
[10:18] 19th verse that there's two of you will
[10:20] gather together
[10:21] and agree brother brown used that and
[10:23] her vision came for
[10:25] and brother elvin's call was restored
[10:27] but this sister came up
[10:28] she's a brother children there's many
[10:30] things has been said and she
[10:32] said one thing in particular watch now
[10:34] what is your need tonight
