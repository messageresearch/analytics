[35:58] the Lord
[36:01] amen um you can be seated just for a

[36:08] that we received from Brother Jason and
[36:12] I I can't say a whole
[36:14] lot um I can't name call but um it comes
[36:19] from um th this is not the scene where
[36:23] Believers are there's a pastor there and
[36:26] uh Brother JD has asked me not to say
[36:28] his name over the Internet because we're
[36:31] streaming but uh the report from him is
[36:34] that they are you know um hunkering down
[36:38] and that attacks are going on throughout
[36:41] Israel you're going to see a clip here
[36:43] that is reflective of actually what's
[36:46] happening on the ground and a lot of
[36:49] times the Western media you know because
[36:52] of the liberal slant of things they
[36:54] don't want to show everything and I can
[36:57] promise you I promise you no matter what
[37:01] happens no matter what Israel does in
[37:04] defense of their Nation they basically
[37:06] had a 911 event like we did and when
[37:09] that happened we went straight to War uh
[37:12] they're going to do the same thing
[37:14] however you can rest assure they will be
[37:17] very heavily condemned for it by the
[37:20] world um they'll be called you know
[37:22] they'll be called genocide and
[37:23] everything and all they're doing they've
[37:25] literally been in
[37:27] eved what you're seeing is a running gun
[37:33] battle on their
[37:35] interstates if you went out to 95 and
[37:39] you were driving and suddenly an enemy
[37:42] from the tree line opened fire and
[37:45] fortunately there was a convoy of
[37:48] Israeli soldiers and they all hit the
[37:51] brakes jump out and this is a liveaction
[37:55] running gun battle the people filming it
[37:58] inside a car are hunkering down trying
[38:01] not to get killed amen just want to give
[38:05] you this brother Matt go
[38:25] ahead
[38:26] [Music]
[38:33] go
[38:55] go
[38:58] [Music]
[39:05] that's happening in real time that's
[39:08] very recent it would be no different
[39:10] friends put yourself going up 21 you're
[39:14] passing by the air station and suddenly
[39:17] you come under Fire and Marines are
[39:19] flooding out of the air station to
[39:22] return fire that's what's happening on
[39:24] the ground in Israel right
[39:27] they have crossed the borders they've
[39:28] invaded they've killed innocent they
[39:31] went after children and women and I saw
[39:35] a
[39:36] clip of Israelis being taken hostage and
[39:40] women being separated and carried off in
[39:43] vehicles um already bleeding and so this
[39:47] is happening and uh we want to be
[39:50] praying the Bible tells us in multiple
[39:53] places that we should pray for the Peace
[39:55] of Israel
[39:56] for the Peace of Jerusalem and you know
[39:59] we know that of course that's not going
[40:03] to stop all nations in in coming against
[40:06] Jerusalem in the tribulation that's
[40:08] going to happen your prayers aren't
[40:10] going to stop that but there are
[40:12] believers there and we're praying Lord
[40:14] keep your hand over all of your family
[40:17] over the innocent people watch over
[40:20] soldiers and you know I don't we don't
[40:22] want to see people killed on either side
[40:25] of a conflict but you know I know that
[40:28] the Lord has all of this in his control
[40:32] that's the thing you really want to take
[40:33] away friends is the Lord is in control
[40:37] this is the uh this is a surprise attack
[40:40] uh very similar they haven't seen
[40:42] anything like it since 73 on yam kapor
[40:46] when uh um Arab Nations poured across
[40:49] their border and Israel nearly collapsed
[40:53] I don't know how familiar you are with
[40:55] that but they nearly were overrun they
[40:58] were taken by surprise their
[40:59] intelligence had an epic failure to
[41:02] detect it and they were literally facing
[41:05] the collapse of the capital uh I think
[41:08] it was Egyptian and Syrian were in a
[41:12] coming from the North and the South and
[41:15] Israel had it is known that Israel is a
[41:17] nuclear nation and they have all it is
[41:21] it is absolutely established fact and I
[41:24] verified it Israel had
[41:27] nuclear bombs armed on the planes on the
[41:31] runway and the bombers with engines
[41:33] running and they were waiting for the
[41:36] command to
[41:38] strike and Washington found out about it
[41:41] called the cremin said you better tell
[41:44] them uh Egyptians and syrians to stop or
[41:49] we're looking at
[41:50] Armageddon and just the hand of God
[41:53] moving and political pressure was
[41:55] applied lied and we didn't face uh
[41:59] Global you know nuclear war in the 70s
[42:02] you know why we didn't because God
[42:04] wasn't ready for it amen hallelujah he
[42:07] still had names on that book Hallelujah
[42:10] and I'm so glad to know that my name is
[42:13] on that book praise the name of the Lord
[42:16] and at you say when will it all end
[42:18] it'll end at the appointed
[42:20] hour it'll end ex that's what Jesus said
[42:23] the father has that you just understand
[42:25] this it's a date on his calendar known
[42:28] to God Amen Hallelujah and it's not
[42:31] you're not going to speed it up or
[42:32] hinder it amen but friends the world is
[42:36] falling apart it's happening right now
[42:39] and my personal opinion and I I as a
[42:44] student of History I study historical
[42:46] Trends I preach by history history has
[42:49] moved at the pace of Prophecy since
[42:52] since the uh the earliest civilizations
[42:55] that's provable by the Bible and an
[42:57] overlay of history and I can tell you as
[43:00] a student of History who studies it and
[43:03] teaches it what you're seeing now is
[43:07] something to take notice of this is not
[43:10] a small thing and I uh you know I I
[43:14] believe it looks to me like this could
[43:16] really get out of control very quick and
[43:20] uh we know Iran is behind it Western
[43:23] Nations know that intelligence Services
[43:25] know that and if Israel decides to take
[43:28] advantage and strike
[43:31] Iran you need to be close to the
[43:35] Lord I just want to say to you the time
[43:38] for playing church has ended amen it
[43:42] it's it's going home time amen we know
[43:45] that we will not be here when that
[43:48] happens amen so that's clear in Prophecy
[43:53] amen so I just wanted to give you that
[43:55] update today
[43:56] and uh the pastor there says that all
[43:58] the Believers are accounted for
[44:00] currently and safe but they are having
[44:02] to hunker down and there's all kinds of
[44:05] emergency procedures they're having
[44:07] these this this is all over they they
[44:09] have found pockets of this you know they
[44:12] realize that they got into more than
[44:14] just one little Hamlet and one military
[44:16] base they've spread out and attacks are
[44:19] still going on and so the Israeli Army
[44:22] is trying to get control of their
[44:24] borders and and they're trying to rescue
[44:28] hostages as we speak so will you be
[44:30] praying for them amen praise the Lord
[44:34] we're going to take today I'm going to
[44:36] invite you to stand back with me for a
[44:38] reading in Genesis chapter
[44:40] 1 I'm hoping to conclude today my
[44:44] lengthy series 10 part 10th part today
[44:47] rebuilding Eden rebuilding
[44:51] Eden
[44:52] amen praise the Lord
[44:56] in Genesis
[44:59] 1 it's um a lengthy reading so we will
[45:04] um read through quickly Genesis
[45:08] 1:1 in the beginning God created the
[45:11] Heaven and the Earth and the Earth was
[45:13] without form and void and darkness was
[45:16] upon the face of the deep and the spirit
[45:19] of God moved upon the face of the waters
[45:21] and God said let there be light and
[45:23] there was light and God saw the light
[45:26] that it was good and God divided the
[45:28] light from the darkness and God called
[45:31] the light day and the Darkness he called
[45:34] night and the evening and the morning
[45:36] were the first day and God said let
[45:39] there be a firmament in the midst of the
[45:41] waters and let it divide the waters from
[45:43] the waters and God made the firmament
[45:46] and divided the waters which were under
[45:48] the firmament from the waters which were
[45:50] above the firmament and it was so and
[45:53] God called the firmament heaven and the
[45:56] evening and the morning were the second
[45:58] day and God said let the waters under
[46:00] the heaven be gathered together into one
[46:03] place and let the dry land appear and it
[46:05] was so I think it's pretty clear who's
[46:07] in
[46:08] control there's no ambiguity who's
[46:10] calling the
[46:12] shots he's not counseling with anybody
[46:14] there's no
[46:15] committee this isn't a
[46:18] denomination this is One Sovereign in
[46:21] control of his creation aren't you glad
[46:23] he's in control of you
[46:27] and God called the dry land Earth and
[46:30] the Gathering Together of the waters
[46:32] called he
[46:34] seeds and God saw that it was good and
[46:38] God said let the Earth bring forth grass
[46:40] the herb yielding seed and the fruit
[46:41] tree yielding fruit after his kind whose
[46:44] seed is in itself upon the Earth and it
[46:46] was so and the Earth brought forth grass
[46:49] and Herb yielding seed after his kind
[46:51] and the tree yielding fruit whose seed
[46:53] was in itself after his kind and God saw
[46:55] that it was good the evening and the
[46:56] morning were the third day he goes on
[46:58] down and down and down fourth day fifth
[47:01] day sixth day he comes to verse 24 and
[47:04] God said let the Earth bring forth the
[47:06] living creature after its kind cattle
[47:08] and creeping thing and beast of the
[47:10] earth after its kind and it was so and
[47:12] God made the Beast of the earth after
[47:14] his kind and cattle after their kind and
[47:17] everything that creepeth upon the Earth
[47:19] after his kind and God saw that it was
[47:20] good and God said let us make man in our
[47:23] image after our likeness let them have
[47:26] dominion over the fish of the sea and
[47:28] over the foul of the air and over the
[47:29] cattle and over the Earth and over every
[47:31] creeping thing that creepeth upon the
[47:33] Earth so God created man in his own
[47:36] image in the image of God created he him
[47:39] male and female created he them God
[47:41] blessed them and God said unto them be
[47:44] fruitful and multiply and replenish the
[47:47] Earth and subdue it now he's
[47:49] transferring some
[47:51] Authority he's been doing it all now
[47:53] he's got somebody in his own image and
[47:55] he's saying now I want you to take over
[47:58] see have dominion over the fish of the
[48:00] sea and over the fowl of the air and
[48:02] over every living thing that moveth upon
[48:04] the Earth and God said behold I have
[48:07] given you every herb bearing seed which
[48:08] is upon the face of all the Earth and
[48:10] every tree and the
[48:12] which is the fruit of a tree yielding
[48:15] seed to you it shall be for meat to
[48:17] every beast of the earth and to every
[48:19] foul of the air and everything that
[48:21] creepeth upon the Earth wherein there is
[48:23] life I have given every every green herb
[48:26] for me and it was so and God saw
[48:29] everything that he had made and behold
[48:31] it was very good and the evening and the
[48:34] morning were the sixth day three verses
[48:36] into chapter two thus the heavens and
[48:39] the Earth were finished and all the host
[48:41] of them and on the seventh day God ended
[48:44] his work which he had made and he rested
[48:47] on the seventh day from all his work
[48:50] which he had made and God blessed the
[48:53] seventh day and Sanctified it it because
[48:56] that in it he had rested from all his
[48:59] work which God created and made from
[49:02] there it goes on into the generations of
[49:04] the heavens all right let's
[49:06] pray I have a special prayer request
[49:09] from um brother Donnie Reagan is asking
[49:12] prayer we had to take Erica to the
[49:15] hospital yesterday she has pneumonia in
[49:18] both lungs and pancreatis and high
[49:19] ammonia levels and Colitis would you all
[49:22] remember her today she needs a touch
[49:25] from the Master but then he says but
[49:28] none of these things back to as Paul
[49:31] said in the book of Acts but none of
[49:33] these things move us from believing that
[49:37] our God is going to completely restore
[49:39] her father we give you thanks today for
[49:43] this Faith Lord that brother Donnie has
[49:45] for his daughter We join our faith with
[49:48] his faith Lord may you join your faith
[49:50] with our faith and push this promise
[49:52] through to completion May our sister
[49:55] receive receive a merciful Touch by the
[49:57] master today Grant it Lord we have
[50:00] prayed much and we continue to pray and
[50:02] we will not stop praying Lord we are
[50:04] determined to see our sister Lord
[50:06] brought back under thy blessing of
[50:08] Health today I pray you'll bless the
[50:10] word the hearing the reading Lord the
[50:13] speaker and the hearer commit myself
[50:16] into your hands completely now in the
[50:18] name of Jesus Christ amen God bless you
[50:21] friends you can be
[50:24] seated
[50:42] man just waiting for the commotion to
[50:44] die
[50:45] down everybody
[50:47] good praise the
[50:53] Lord the Bible knowledge commentary
[50:56] volume
[50:58] two concerning Genesis 1:1 makes this
[51:03] statement the account of Genesis 1:1
[51:06] where we read in the beginning God
[51:07] created the Heaven and the
[51:09] earth and the commentator says the
[51:12] account
[51:14] reveals that that God is a redeeming God
[51:20] it records how and this is what you read
[51:22] in that lengthy reading it records how
[51:26] that he brought the cosmos out of chaos
[51:30] he turned Darkness into light he made
[51:34] divisions between them he
[51:37] transformed cursing into blessing and
[51:41] moved from what was evil and darkness to
[51:44] what was holy now that is a a perfect
[51:49] type of what he has done for you and I
[51:52] when we were born in sin and we came
[51:55] into the world in darkness and our lives
[51:58] in chaos and so bad was our situation so
[52:03] hopess was our condition that Paul said
[52:07] that the mind that you were given that
[52:10] you were born with when you were born in
[52:12] sin could actually never agree with God
[52:17] you could never believe him you could
[52:19] never agree with him it is hopeless for
[52:24] mankind B born in sin to save himself
[52:28] find God or find his way
[52:32] home our home is in heaven above as what
[52:36] the Bible teaches us that we are we have
[52:39] Jerusalem above the mother of us all
[52:44] this is why in the Old Testament
[52:46] whenever you read about Jerusalem
[52:49] referred to as Zion and you realize a
[52:52] prophet said that's always a type of the
[52:55] bre bride it's always a type of the of
[52:57] the wife of Christ and and and that's
[53:01] such an important point because you know
[53:04] one of the prayers as I was saying one
[53:06] of the areas that tells us to pray for
[53:10] the Peace of
[53:12] Jerusalem is not only there's two verses
[53:15] in Psalms and I'm not going to turn to
[53:17] it today because I'm already got a lot
[53:19] to cover and I don't want to go too
[53:20] long but but one verse says that you
[53:25] should
[53:27] pray without and I'm just I'm just I'm
[53:30] just uh paraphrasing it don't stop
[53:33] praying for the Peace of
[53:35] Jerusalem and the next verse to my
[53:38] astonishment when I read it I thought am
[53:41] I seeing things I didn't ever remember
[53:44] reading it and it said and give God no
[53:49] rest until he does
[53:53] it blue my mind all my years of reading
[53:56] the Bible I never remembered I if I read
[53:59] it I read across it and didn't catch it
[54:02] don't let and God is saying through
[54:04] David here's what I want you to do don't
[54:06] give me a
[54:08] break don't let up on me keep praying
[54:12] until I make Jerusalem a city of peace
[54:16] and I just say if Jerusalem is Zion and
[54:19] Zion is the bride that I'm not going to
[54:21] give him any rest until he brings my
[54:24] life to where it needs to be until he
[54:27] brings this whole assembly and all your
[54:29] families to where it needs to be give
[54:32] give no rest to the Holy
[54:36] Spirit no wonder brother Brandon would
[54:38] say just start knocking to he that
[54:40] knocketh say Lord I'm not going to stop
[54:45] are you getting tired of Me Knocking I'm
[54:47] having a good time
[54:49] knocking that's what we need friends
[54:52] this world's falling apart and we need
[54:54] the power of the Living God moving Among
[54:57] Us and I would say don't stop praying
[55:00] for it don't stop pressing for
[55:06] it by allowing the light to shine on my
[55:10] Eden soil my
[55:13] Stardust as NASA says we are
[55:17] visy
[55:20] Stardust brother brandham said before
[55:23] Stardust I I I existed
[55:27] Hallelujah so just as in the Garden of
[55:31] Eden those ages long ago when all
[55:34] Darkness was cleared
[55:36] away the water was rolled back and the
[55:39] dry land
[55:40] appear and Eden soil before it ever was
[55:45] separated it already was in existence
[55:48] but the water had covered it it's
[55:50] interesting because when you look at
[55:53] that as an analogy as a type you say
[55:56] goodness the water was covering over all
[55:59] the land with all the seed and nothing
[56:01] could grow but yet water is the source
[56:03] of life for the seed to grow it needs
[56:06] light and it needs water it's say wow it
[56:09] it it kind of loged jams the spiritual
[56:12] type because it's almost as if that
[56:14] thing which was s which was to support
[56:18] life was hindering life but that's not
[56:22] uncommon at all when you're talking
[56:24] about something in a fallen condition
[56:27] because that's when you when the
[56:29] narrative opens up when the drama the
[56:31] first scene in the curtain opens in
[56:33] Genesis 1:1 the Earth has already been
[56:37] there a long
[56:38] time in in the beginning God created the
[56:41] heavens and the Earth period doesn't say
[56:43] when how long what he did it just simply
[56:46] says that's what he did and then that's
[56:47] it and then verse two he begins bringing
[56:51] it back it came out of a ruined
[56:53] condition it came out of a chaos
[56:55] Darkness covered the face of the deep
[56:57] water there was no dry land the
[56:59] firmaments weren't even
[57:01] divided this is some type of a prophet
[57:03] calls it a ruined Earth from uh
[57:05] something prior we don't know we'll
[57:08] we'll understand it better by and by
[57:09] it's rather ambiguous in scripture but
[57:12] but it's a type of you and I the the
[57:15] Earth hadn't always been ruined than it
[57:18] was and now he's fixing it I I wasn't
[57:20] always born in sin I had a beginning in
[57:23] the mind of God but then I came born in
[57:25] sin but now he's fixing
[57:27] me
[57:30] hallelujah hallelujah thank
[57:37] God he's fixing me he's fixing
[57:41] you and he he he how does he do it he
[57:47] gives his word that's how he always
[57:50] operates there there's there's times
[57:53] where I would like him to slap you
[58:00] around and there's times he needs to
[58:02] slap me
[58:05] around knock some sense out into you or
[58:08] some stupidity out of
[58:10] you but he doesn't do it that way he
[58:13] sends his word and he gives you the
[58:16] choice whether or not to believe it I'm
[58:19] here to tell you if you'll just believe
[58:20] it and receive it and Obey it it'll fix
[58:23] the chaos it'll repair you I don't care
[58:27] what's happened it'll repair
[58:31] you he by his word the word just obeyed
[58:35] him his brother R would say one time he
[58:37] said you know if God could have chose
[58:39] the the the the wind to preach the
[58:43] gospel he chose what the Bible calls the
[58:46] foolishness of preaching and that's so
[58:48] crazy because it's Fallen men preaching
[58:51] to Fallen men trying to get us all
[58:53] perfect
[58:57] so it's the foolishness of preaching but
[58:58] it's what God chose see and so Propet
[59:02] said he could have chose the wind he
[59:04] could have done that he said he could
[59:06] have chose the trees to do it in fact as
[59:08] he said had he chose the wind the wind
[59:10] would have just obeyed him the trees
[59:12] would have just obeyed him he we already
[59:14] know Jesus commanded the winds and the
[59:17] waves we already know he said to a to a
[59:20] to an olive tree you'll bear or you'll
[59:22] bear no more forever and it began to
[59:24] wither up
[59:25] immediately and so we already know that
[59:28] nature always obeys him Prophet said but
[59:30] it's man who gives him his
[59:33] trouble God's not looking for robots or
[59:36] Androids or forced slavery he he doesn't
[59:39] want worship like Nebuchadnezzar did
[59:44] where which slavery Worship You worship
[59:46] or I'll kill you it's not that God God
[59:49] loves and God wants to be loved and God
[59:53] gives and and he he desires the whole
[59:56] thing was about building a kingdom
[59:59] Prophet said he was alone but he he
[1:00:01] wanted to share his eternal life with
[1:00:05] Humanity who could not love a god with
[1:00:08] that kind of a heart that kind of a soul
[1:00:11] who who takes no pleasure in even the
[1:00:14] death of his
[1:00:16] enemies takes no pleasure he would that
[1:00:19] all men come to repentance the Bible
[1:00:21] says he knows they won't but he desires
[1:00:24] he gives them a chance and he
[1:00:26] tries it's why a prophet said if you go
[1:00:29] to hell remember Hell friends was never
[1:00:31] built for human beings it was built for
[1:00:33] the devil and his angels but the Bible
[1:00:35] says Hell hath enlarged itself like a
[1:00:37] prison overcrowded prison they had to
[1:00:38] build on new Wings because it's now
[1:00:39] housing humans who wer never supposed to
[1:00:41] be
[1:00:42] there and he said if you go to hell
[1:00:44] you'll fight every step of the way
[1:00:46] because God will set every kind of
[1:00:48] barricade and block and try to block you
[1:00:49] and he he'll do it with parents and
[1:00:52] preachers and friends and prayers and he
[1:00:54] and and then if none of if none of the
[1:00:56] good things work then he'll plague you
[1:00:57] and and and go after you and whip you
[1:01:00] and and try everything he can like a
[1:01:03] loving parent would
[1:01:04] do you don't love a child if you don't
[1:01:07] discipline the child because they're
[1:01:09] they're wild weed they can't they they
[1:01:11] can't grow
[1:01:13] straight they they have to have
[1:01:15] nurturing they have to have training you
[1:01:18] don't you don't raise up children and
[1:01:19] start letting them make their own
[1:01:21] decisions as a child that's ignorant
[1:01:24] nature itself no nowhere does that
[1:01:26] happen in nature see and so I mean you
[1:01:30] know those those Mama bears they raise
[1:01:33] those Cubs until they're able and then
[1:01:35] sometimes even will keep them even
[1:01:37] longer see so so so you find that that
[1:01:41] you know God operates in this exact same
[1:01:45] way just the same way he rolled back
[1:01:47] Waters and dry land appear he brought
[1:01:50] order out of chaos and and and this is
[1:01:53] literally the heart of every son and
[1:01:55] daughter of God born in in the darkness
[1:01:58] of chaos and they overflowed you know as
[1:02:02] I was giving you a while ago the analogy
[1:02:04] of the water remember that
[1:02:07] Paul goes into the book of Romans and he
[1:02:11] he starts taking the Law of God which
[1:02:14] came from God and Paul says now here's
[1:02:16] an interesting thing that that
[1:02:20] Satan he saw the word of God and then he
[1:02:23] saw me
[1:02:25] and he knew if I'm born in sin there's
[1:02:28] no way I can keep
[1:02:30] this it's not possible even and and and
[1:02:33] he also knows that even if I'm a good
[1:02:36] person that still wouldn't have any
[1:02:39] Eternal value it has temporal value if
[1:02:41] you're good if you give God will see to
[1:02:44] it that people give unto you you reap
[1:02:47] what you sow so goodness so kindness
[1:02:49] you'll reap it back but as far as
[1:02:52] Eternal value as far as escaping the
[1:02:54] Realms of mortality into the new heavens
[1:02:57] and the new Earth you have to be born
[1:02:59] again there there's no amount of good
[1:03:02] works that can earn you the right to
[1:03:04] live in heaven you have to be born
[1:03:07] again and so Paul says that here Satan
[1:03:12] was taking advantage of the good word
[1:03:16] and you and he said he was actually
[1:03:19] using the word which was for life and he
[1:03:24] was applying it to me and it brought me
[1:03:26] death cuz I couldn't keep the word and
[1:03:29] so now I I'm on the I'm on the hook to
[1:03:33] keep it but I can't and even what a
[1:03:36] little bit I can still do is still just
[1:03:38] so far below God its filthiness at best
[1:03:41] to him that's how much higher he is and
[1:03:44] so it's just like genesis the water
[1:03:46] which was supposed to give life is now
[1:03:49] is now hindering life the word which was
[1:03:51] sent to give life because you're born in
[1:03:53] sin it's now it's now condemning you
[1:03:56] that's why brother and said the law all
[1:03:58] the law could do was put you in jail all
[1:04:00] it could do was condemn you but Christ
[1:04:03] came to fulfill the law on your behalf
[1:04:06] and now you can go free you can be born
[1:04:10] again you can have all the chaos
[1:04:13] removed and you can be a fruitful field
[1:04:16] for the
[1:04:18] Lord so we realize then that the same
[1:04:22] word that was spoken
[1:04:25] let there be
[1:04:26] light it speaks to us now and it rolls
[1:04:30] back the Waters of death and darkness so
[1:04:33] that the seed that we were born with can
[1:04:36] shine in the presence of God's sunlight
[1:04:38] it brings forth life it brings forth
[1:04:41] life I'm here to tell you Jesus called
[1:04:43] the gospel a
[1:04:44] seed I mean there is so much value in
[1:04:48] that because it's good seed and if it
[1:04:51] falls in the right bedding ground you
[1:04:53] know what it'll do
[1:04:54] it'll grow the same Garden of Eden that
[1:04:57] God
[1:04:59] grew your life has the potential to
[1:05:04] become a garden of beauty and
[1:05:09] Perfection Adam and Eve operated in
[1:05:14] Perfection all was peace forever more in
[1:05:18] that happy Golden
[1:05:20] Shore there was no Strife between Adam
[1:05:23] and Eve they had a perfect marriage a
[1:05:26] perfect home they would have brought
[1:05:28] forth perfect children and perfect
[1:05:30] Offspring as they were commanded to do
[1:05:33] but before that could come about God's
[1:05:36] enemy Prophet says he slipped in under
[1:05:39] the wall and he began to reason he went
[1:05:42] after Eve because of her unique way of
[1:05:45] coming into the Earth her beginning was
[1:05:48] unmanifested she was contained within
[1:05:50] Adam until at a later time after
[1:05:53] creation God put him to sleep and took
[1:05:56] her out because of this way that she
[1:05:58] came it exposed her to reasoning he he
[1:06:03] never went to try to reason with Adam
[1:06:05] that would have been impossible Adam was
[1:06:06] the son of God and would have never
[1:06:08] reasoned God's word and therefore you're
[1:06:11] not to reason God's word see and so but
[1:06:16] she did she she made that terrible
[1:06:18] terrible
[1:06:21] mistake now we find that that when that
[1:06:24] happened and she reasoned the word of
[1:06:26] God Prophet said it like this when
[1:06:30] she received the devil's
[1:06:36] liie then she received his
[1:06:41] L you see the spoken word is the
[1:06:44] Original Seed so you
[1:06:48] have no chance to be an overcomer if you
[1:06:53] doubt and reason the word of
[1:06:55] God you literally are defeating your own
[1:06:58] self it's not that the word is powerless
[1:07:00] it's that you will not allow it to
[1:07:03] operate in your life and that's your
[1:07:05] choice I've made my choice I I as for me
[1:07:09] in my house we're going to believe it
[1:07:12] and we're going to live it you say Do
[1:07:13] you ever fail at it I do but thankfully
[1:07:16] I have an advocate with God Christ Jesus
[1:07:20] who intercedes on my behalf when I do
[1:07:22] make a mistake
[1:07:26] and I'm going to Avail myself of that
[1:07:28] I'm not going to let that sit in my
[1:07:29] treasure chest and never spend it that's
[1:07:32] right see the world cast great doubt on
[1:07:36] this Victor
[1:07:38] Hugo when he was past 80 years of
[1:07:41] age he gave expression to his religious
[1:07:45] faith in these Sublime sentences he
[1:07:47] says I feel in myself the future life
[1:07:53] it's past 80
[1:07:55] I am like a
[1:07:57] forest which has been more than once cut
[1:08:00] down the new shoots are livelier than
[1:08:04] ever I am Rising toward the
[1:08:07] sky the sunshine is on my head the Earth
[1:08:12] gives me its generous sap but Heaven
[1:08:15] lights me with its unknown
[1:08:18] worlds you say the soul is nothing but
[1:08:22] the resultant of the bodily
[1:08:25] Powers why then is my soul more luminous
[1:08:30] when my body Powers begin to
[1:08:33] fail winter is on my head but Eternal
[1:08:37] spring is in my heart I breathe at this
[1:08:42] hour the fragrance of the lilacs the
[1:08:45] violets and the Roses as at 20 years I
[1:08:50] the nearer I approach the end the pler I
[1:08:54] hear around me the immortal Symphonies
[1:08:58] of the worlds which invite me it is a
[1:09:02] marvelous yet simple truth that Hugo
[1:09:06] realizes in in his as the older he
[1:09:10] gotten the closer to Heaven he felt am I
[1:09:13] want to say to you today friends don't
[1:09:16] let the world paint Heaven as some story
[1:09:19] some fabrication it's a real land it's
[1:09:23] in existence
[1:09:24] right now there are people living there
[1:09:26] there are people you have known in this
[1:09:29] lifetime who are living there alive
[1:09:32] right now and they're saying as a
[1:09:34] prophet heard press the battle you can
[1:09:37] make it you're almost
[1:09:42] home
[1:09:46] Hallelujah we've been in this
[1:09:50] series making the statement over the
[1:09:53] last several
[1:09:54] installments how that Holiness is
[1:09:58] embedded uh in
[1:10:01] love in the Eden
[1:10:04] Story the reason that and I just want to
[1:10:08] say
[1:10:10] this not perhaps that Believers need
[1:10:14] this you know this this this opening
[1:10:18] statement but perhaps because I've dealt
[1:10:22] with it again and again and again and
[1:10:25] again and I'm going to go down the path
[1:10:28] a little bit today not it's not really
[1:10:30] the the the main stay of my
[1:10:33] sermon but I don't get to choose these
[1:10:36] things I have to follow the
[1:10:41] boss but there is such
[1:10:44] a uh an
[1:10:48] assault today that of all places comes
[1:10:52] from modern Christianity yeah of all
[1:10:57] places it's not even the liberal left
[1:11:01] it's actually the conservative
[1:11:03] right that says God is love which is
[1:11:08] true and it doesn't really matter how
[1:11:11] you live or what you do God judges the
[1:11:15] heart forgetting completely that if the
[1:11:17] Heart Is Right the outside will be right
[1:11:20] as if they're just ignoring that and I
[1:11:23] and and I say they're ignoring it
[1:11:25] because there's no way they could be so
[1:11:28] naive as to actually they believe it
[1:11:30] because they want to believe
[1:11:31] it as I've said to you before if you
[1:11:34] don't if you don't if you go up years
[1:11:38] and I've seen this and I'm seeing
[1:11:41] this that and I'm seeing it more than
[1:11:45] I've ever seen it that if you sat in a
[1:11:48] message church for enough years and you
[1:11:52] never get the B baptism of the Holy
[1:11:54] Spirit but you remain only mentally
[1:11:57] convinced of it eventually your
[1:11:59] willpower to live Holiness will erode
[1:12:03] and you'll start leaning into carnality
[1:12:06] and the and the design of the
[1:12:09] world and and if and if and if you don't
[1:12:12] get that arrested and what we're seeing
[1:12:14] is is that you'll finally get so
[1:12:17] impatient with constantly having to live
[1:12:21] a Holiness standard that you'll start
[1:12:23] looking around for a different version
[1:12:26] of The Gospel that will tell you you
[1:12:28] don't have
[1:12:31] to you will minimalize the value of the
[1:12:34] message you will minimalize the
[1:12:36] authority of the Prophet don't tell me
[1:12:39] it won't happen I'm already seeing
[1:12:44] it it's a
[1:12:47] fact so I I want to say
[1:12:52] again yes God is love the love of God is
[1:12:57] immeasurable but Holiness is
[1:13:01] embedded in his
[1:13:04] love right living is embedded in his
[1:13:10] love don't imagine that you can live an
[1:13:13] ungodly lifestyle and call that the love
[1:13:16] of God that is a conundrum that is that
[1:13:20] is that is impo that's impossible
[1:13:24] see so when we when we go to the
[1:13:30] most more often than not people we we
[1:13:34] talk about the Ten Commandments from
[1:13:37] Horeb and you know because that's where
[1:13:40] everybody say okay well that's where the
[1:13:41] law began to be given and thou shalt not
[1:13:43] kill and thou sht not steal and shall
[1:13:44] not commit adultery and shall not do
[1:13:46] this and bear false witness and covet
[1:13:48] and all these different things and and
[1:13:51] and you know which is exactly why I've
[1:13:53] said said and say again you know my my
[1:13:56] wife and I we we were just talking about
[1:13:58] this recently my goodness if if if there
[1:14:01] wasn't even no heaven and there was I
[1:14:04] would still live a Christian lifestyle
[1:14:05] because it's
[1:14:06] better it's healthier I as I've said
[1:14:10] you've heard me say it before I get to
[1:14:11] hang on to all my money I get to stay in
[1:14:13] health I don't blow it on wild living I
[1:14:16] don't I don't eat up my body with with
[1:14:19] diseases social diseases and and and
[1:14:22] controlled substances that destroys me I
[1:14:25] I I I I don't abuse my wife or my
[1:14:28] children we have love and we and the
[1:14:30] Christian lifestyle teaches me
[1:14:33] that it's a much better lifestyle people
[1:14:36] are crazy to not live it even if they're
[1:14:38] not a Christian they should live it
[1:14:39] they'll have a better
[1:14:41] life absolutely have a better life see
[1:14:45] because those principles of God work
[1:14:49] because they're a seed Jesus called it a
[1:14:51] seed it'll grow a crop and it'll grow in
[1:14:55] Eden so so when we look at these Ten
[1:15:00] Commandments from
[1:15:01] Horeb I I want to make a statement and
[1:15:04] and I'm there's a number of things today
[1:15:06] that I'm going to go slow on on purpose
[1:15:08] because this is my perhaps my last
[1:15:10] chance in this series to nail this one
[1:15:13] more
[1:15:14] time the Ten Commandments from
[1:15:18] Horeb were not first written at
[1:15:22] Horeb they were first written in Adam's
[1:15:26] heart and Genesis bears that
[1:15:29] out it was you know when we come to
[1:15:34] horb it was it was
[1:15:38] insincere
[1:15:40] individuals who desired to codify it all
[1:15:43] in
[1:15:44] writing was
[1:15:46] insincere Prophet said that was never
[1:15:48] God's plan they had a prophet they had
[1:15:50] the pillar of fire they had a Brazen
[1:15:51] altar they had everything they needed a
[1:15:54] cloud by day a fire by Night the angel
[1:15:56] of the Lord's presence a Vindicated
[1:15:59] Prophet but man wanted something to do
[1:16:02] in it he he the reason he wants
[1:16:04] something to do in it is so he can
[1:16:05] control it and so he wanted to have a
[1:16:08] part he wanted a law Prophet said it's
[1:16:10] the most his Kentucky English rational
[1:16:13] thing meaning irrational thing they ever
[1:16:16] did and and and and the only reason even
[1:16:19] Jesus shows us that the only reason God
[1:16:21] gave it to him was to prove to him they
[1:16:23] couldn't keep
[1:16:25] it see to get people to understand you
[1:16:29] can't save
[1:16:32] yourself you've got to surrender eternal
[1:16:35] life comes by
[1:16:37] surrender Christ will give it to you but
[1:16:40] you've got to let
[1:16:44] him hallu so it was in sincere people
[1:16:48] who desire to have it in writing and and
[1:16:52] and just as in the days of Samuel there
[1:16:54] were make Believers of Jehovah who
[1:16:57] preferred a mortal King over God being
[1:17:00] their Divine
[1:17:02] King you know Joshua having crossed over
[1:17:06] and he met the captain of the Lord's
[1:17:08] host and and and what you see God laying
[1:17:13] out to Joshua after he met the captain
[1:17:15] of the Lord's host and he said now
[1:17:16] here's what you're going to do here's
[1:17:18] your battle tactic here's your first
[1:17:20] Target and don't worry if you follow my
[1:17:24] instructions this is going to not exist
[1:17:27] and it's going to you're going to
[1:17:28] reclaim the land and then after that
[1:17:29] there'll be another one and another one
[1:17:31] and another one because I am giving you
[1:17:34] this land that's the only people I know
[1:17:36] of in history in all the world are are
[1:17:39] the children of Abraham who the creator
[1:17:42] of the world says I'm going to give you
[1:17:43] a piece of my world and I'm actually
[1:17:45] going to deed it to you they're the only
[1:17:47] people I know everybody says oh it's our
[1:17:49] nation and you go all the way back to
[1:17:50] Native Americans saying oh it our well
[1:17:52] who gave gave it to us who gave it to
[1:17:54] you well who gave it to them I only know
[1:17:56] of one group that the Creator who built
[1:17:59] it said I'll give it to
[1:18:03] you and and God warns them for years
[1:18:08] decades and even centuries get out of it
[1:18:11] my people are sojourning they're going
[1:18:13] to be in PR in slavery for 400 years but
[1:18:15] I'm going to bring them out you better
[1:18:17] clear
[1:18:18] out and then this people say oh God was
[1:18:21] so cruel he killed those people that he
[1:18:24] warned them for 400 years get off of
[1:18:27] Abraham's property the eviction is going
[1:18:30] to be painful just
[1:18:33] leave and they dug in defying God just
[1:18:36] like Sinners do today it's my body It's
[1:18:38] My Life I'll do what I want who told you
[1:18:41] that who told you it was your body in
[1:18:43] your life did you build it can you keep
[1:18:45] it alive can you keep the air going and
[1:18:48] can you keep your heart going you have
[1:18:51] nothing you owe God everything you owe
[1:18:53] him the breath in your lungs if it
[1:18:55] wasn't for God you'd have
[1:18:57] nothing
[1:19:01] Hallelujah so it's it's it's it's even
[1:19:04] so what is Joshua given Joshua is given
[1:19:08] instructions how to begin to build
[1:19:12] Israel the gift that God gave to Abraham
[1:19:15] and his descendants what is God doing
[1:19:18] he's showing him do it this way do it
[1:19:20] that way take this have that move here
[1:19:22] go there put this tribe there put this
[1:19:24] tribe there put this tribe there put
[1:19:26] this tribe there put this tribe uh put
[1:19:29] put put Caleb up here no Caleb wants
[1:19:31] this mountain okay put Caleb over here
[1:19:33] and give him this mountain and and and
[1:19:35] you know what God was doing he's
[1:19:37] building a larger
[1:19:39] Eden he's rebuilding
[1:19:42] Eden what do you think the word is in
[1:19:45] this hour he's rebuilding Eden we're
[1:19:48] rebuilding Eden that's why the word has
[1:19:51] came oh be a believer of it today it'll
[1:19:55] rebuild everything that could ever be
[1:19:57] wrong in your lives and
[1:20:02] homes it was insincere people like achen
[1:20:05] who remain steeped in the what I call
[1:20:10] the miseries of
[1:20:12] humanism humanism and reasoning of God's
[1:20:14] word thank God people like aen didn't
[1:20:17] stop people like
[1:20:18] Joshua thank God there was aens but
[1:20:21] there was still believers there was aens
[1:20:23] but the Israel still conquered
[1:20:27] Hallelujah it will not prevent the Bride
[1:20:29] of the last day either mark that down it
[1:20:32] will not stop
[1:20:35] her
[1:20:36] so so can we
[1:20:40] see this God of love in Eden brother
[1:20:43] Bram tells the story so so tenderly so
[1:20:47] beautifully how that you know God coming
[1:20:50] down you remember God coming coming down
[1:20:54] every evening to he said he would take
[1:20:56] his children he'd come down to visit
[1:20:58] them did you enjoy your day in the
[1:21:02] beautiful world today yes Father oh it
[1:21:05] was so beautiful we were along the ridge
[1:21:07] line and we went down and and and and we
[1:21:10] saw this and that oh my that's wonderful
[1:21:13] I I I've built it all for you I I rule
[1:21:16] the heavens I'm I I'm going to this is
[1:21:18] just the beginning children this is just
[1:21:20] the start we're going to build a whole
[1:21:22] Kingdom we're in this
[1:21:25] together and he said he would now lay
[1:21:28] down and he would lay them down at night
[1:21:30] give them a little kiss on the cheek you
[1:21:33] know and good night I'll see you
[1:21:35] tomorrow off to sleep they would go Eve
[1:21:39] roll over lay and and on on Adam's chest
[1:21:43] and he would stroke her beautiful hair
[1:21:45] and they would just Drift Off to Sleep
[1:21:48] all was beautiful all was peaceful all
[1:21:52] was so So Divine it was it was a model
[1:21:55] it was just God getting started to build
[1:21:58] a Holy Kingdom a holy economy let me
[1:22:00] tell you something friends the eye hath
[1:22:02] not seen the ear has not heard it's
[1:22:05] never into the heart of man what God has
[1:22:07] in store for them that love him how that
[1:22:11] how that he he cared about them he shows
[1:22:14] them his love he shows them his care he
[1:22:16] Prophet said he had them fortified
[1:22:18] behind the
[1:22:19] word they were they were taught moral
[1:22:23] in no uncertain terms this you can
[1:22:26] partake of this you can't don't have
[1:22:30] anything to do with it and the the
[1:22:31] amazing thing was that Satan in the
[1:22:34] Garden of Eden as we were saying
[1:22:36] Wednesday Ezekiel saw him as a man and
[1:22:39] and and and typed him as a king and said
[1:22:42] you have been in Eden and you had all
[1:22:44] these precious stones and you were
[1:22:45] beautiful until sin was found in you and
[1:22:48] so audacious so audacious was Lucifer
[1:22:52] that he built his office right next to
[1:22:55] the to Christ's
[1:22:57] office right in the midst of the garden
[1:23:00] right in the headquarters right in the
[1:23:01] hub right in the center don't think he's
[1:23:04] not trying to do that to you don't think
[1:23:08] he's not trying to crowd in and move the
[1:23:11] Lord out of your life and out of your
[1:23:12] home and then you can start reasoning
[1:23:15] the word of God and he's going to tell
[1:23:16] you oh you'll be a lot happier you the
[1:23:19] Lord knows that you know you don't
[1:23:21] really have to do all these things
[1:23:22] there's no need to limit
[1:23:24] yourself be who you want to be do you go
[1:23:28] for
[1:23:30] it
[1:23:31] see and so he but God made it very clear
[1:23:36] morals Thou shalt not commit adultery
[1:23:39] Thou shalt not do this Thou shalt not
[1:23:40] lie sh not steal sh not kill all these
[1:23:43] different things these morals are taught
[1:23:45] in Eden they didn't get invented at horb
[1:23:50] at sini you see so so the love of God is
[1:23:54] in Eden the moral teaching of God
[1:23:57] there's no ambiguous wording about what
[1:24:00] trees were good and which trees were
[1:24:03] forbidden you know the the the world uh
[1:24:06] you know stayed
[1:24:09] upright as long as his family followed
[1:24:13] the
[1:24:15] word and as soon as they didn't that
[1:24:18] broke the
[1:24:19] world broke the whole world see
[1:24:23] so one would imagine that being told
[1:24:26] something to the face by
[1:24:30] God in
[1:24:32] person you would think that that that
[1:24:34] would prevent even the hardest heart
[1:24:37] from transgression but not
[1:24:39] so they were told to the face by God in
[1:24:45] person I have to look at that and and
[1:24:48] comfort myself in a strange weird way
[1:24:52] when I I stand up here and pour my life
[1:24:54] out for almost three decades and preach
[1:24:56] it as hard as I can quote it out of the
[1:24:59] scripture quote it out of the message
[1:25:00] and yet I see an uh and I'm not worried
[1:25:03] about transgression I don't I don't
[1:25:05] track wins and losses because I got
[1:25:07] those I don't I don't I don't keep a
[1:25:10] there's no record at my house of your W
[1:25:12] and L
[1:25:13] columns wins and
[1:25:15] losses and I wouldn't want you I hope
[1:25:17] you don't keep one on me because I
[1:25:18] probably have more losses than wins and
[1:25:21] that'd probably be the truth that that's
[1:25:22] not what I'm talking about I'm not
[1:25:23] talking about transgressions I'm talking
[1:25:25] about unwilling Hearts who are simply
[1:25:28] unwilling to let the whole word govern
[1:25:29] their lives and they don't mind 90% of
[1:25:33] it but they're determined to have that
[1:25:34] 10% of their own say their own way their
[1:25:36] own
[1:25:38] will
[1:25:40] amen and so I say well goodness if Adam
[1:25:44] and Eve were told to the face by God in
[1:25:47] person and they didn't do it what chance
[1:25:49] do I have but I still got to preach it
[1:25:54] amen God told
[1:25:57] them to the
[1:25:59] face in person you shall not do
[1:26:05] this but
[1:26:07] reasoning is a powerful weapon against
[1:26:10] the word of
[1:26:13] God want to say that again friends I got
[1:26:16] it highlighted on to say it reasoning is
[1:26:19] a powerful weapon against the world word
[1:26:22] of God
[1:26:24] am Satan knows that if he can get you to
[1:26:29] reason the word of God water it down and
[1:26:33] maybe it doesn't matter quite as much as
[1:26:35] the pastor says maybe it's not all that
[1:26:38] incumbent upon me after all the prophet
[1:26:41] was just a man he had his own opinions I
[1:26:43] don't
[1:26:47] necessarily those are the
[1:26:50] people that I fear for
[1:26:52] for on Resurrection
[1:26:55] morning cuz I don't know how you'll get
[1:26:59] the word to come up if you've never
[1:27:02] obeyed come
[1:27:04] out and you've never fully
[1:27:07] surrendered say but the Lord can do it
[1:27:09] he can I'm just saying I fear for you
[1:27:14] I'm not talking about transgressions I'm
[1:27:15] talking about an
[1:27:16] unwillingness to let Christ be the
[1:27:19] center an
[1:27:20] unwillingness to let the message message
[1:27:22] that God ha sent you be the the
[1:27:25] dictation of God's voice for your life
[1:27:29] and your homes and your marriages and
[1:27:31] your
[1:27:32] children fair enough I have not sh to
[1:27:36] declare unto you the whole counsel of
[1:27:38] God I can't get up on that morning and
[1:27:40] know that I held back and maybe it was
[1:27:42] partly my fault can't do that friends I
[1:27:45] love you but I love the word more than
[1:27:48] you
[1:27:50] Hallelujah reason in is a powerful
[1:27:53] weapon against the word even the
[1:27:55] revealed word it has doomed the most
[1:27:58] noble of humanity yet it has been the
[1:28:00] path to uh to failure even for the
[1:28:03] family of God I've seen it people who I
[1:28:06] know have had an experience with the
[1:28:08] Lord I know they have maybe multiple
[1:28:10] experien with the Lord and they're
[1:28:11] Believers for real they're not make
[1:28:13] Believers they're True
[1:28:15] Believers but that that area of
[1:28:18] reasoning of the word where they won't
[1:28:20] come to a full complete surrender I've
[1:28:22] seen it be be a path of failure and a
[1:28:26] path of destruction and and I'm telling
[1:28:28] you that there's no way to escape
[1:28:31] getting down the road Without
[1:28:35] Regrets I just made up my mind I'm done
[1:28:37] with
[1:28:38] regrets I do failing but I quickly
[1:28:41] repent I I try my best I strive I press
[1:28:45] daily cuz I don't want any more
[1:28:49] regrets do you see friends how
[1:28:52] vulnerable you
[1:28:53] are I mean even with I mean to say
[1:28:56] nothing without the Holy Ghost even with
[1:28:58] the Holy Ghost yet you
[1:29:00] refuse to lay aside weights and sins
[1:29:03] Paul said as I said to you Wednesday
[1:29:06] when Paul said lay aside the weights and
[1:29:08] sins that do so easily beset you run
[1:29:11] this race Paul wasn't talking to
[1:29:14] Sinners he was talking to
[1:29:19] Believers see we should never be without
[1:29:23] Holiness Holiness was embedded in the
[1:29:26] love of God all the way back to the Eden
[1:29:29] story I'm G to tell you something
[1:29:31] friends God's God's heart is first
[1:29:34] broken at
[1:29:36] Eden at the gates of Eden that's where
[1:29:39] God had his first
[1:29:42] heartbreak was at the gates of
[1:29:47] Eden when you look at the strict
[1:29:50] guidelines uh that we find in Exodus and
[1:29:54] Leviticus and Deuteronomy those three
[1:29:59] particularly these guidelines against
[1:30:01] immoral behavior that are outlined in
[1:30:03] those three books
[1:30:05] particularly they also had a secondary
[1:30:08] purpose that they
[1:30:11] served they they were they were
[1:30:14] designed to reflect and and of course
[1:30:17] they were they were God said keep this
[1:30:20] so that it may be well with thee in long
[1:30:23] life and I'll bless thee all of that but
[1:30:26] it but it had a
[1:30:27] secondary uh
[1:30:29] application and that is that that they
[1:30:33] were used that that the the
[1:30:36] statutes Israel by being able to read
[1:30:40] them and then they could look at what
[1:30:42] they were and then they could look
[1:30:45] everywhere in all the Heathen Nations
[1:30:47] around them and they could see by what
[1:30:51] they read vers versus what they see then
[1:30:53] they know that there's a
[1:30:56] reflection in the word of what's out
[1:31:00] there am God is saying don't be immoral
[1:31:03] don't be vile don't be ungodly don't be
[1:31:06] sinful don't do this don't do that don't
[1:31:08] do this that when they read that it's
[1:31:10] like looking in a mirror they can go wow
[1:31:13] why is he saying all of that to us we're
[1:31:16] his chosen people because partly it's
[1:31:18] reflecting what's all around them this
[1:31:20] is exactly why
[1:31:22] Israel was supposed to be a
[1:31:25] beacon God dropped a holy nation right
[1:31:28] down in the center of
[1:31:31] idolatry right down in the middle o of
[1:31:34] Eastern mysticism and said now I want
[1:31:37] you to be a Shining Light so that when
[1:31:41] the world over here in their heathenism
[1:31:43] looks at that they'll be attracted
[1:31:44] there's a better way there's a better
[1:31:46] way there was a better way Ruth Ruth saw
[1:31:49] a better way the moabitas she she didn't
[1:31:52] want to go back to her her her Moab she
[1:31:55] said your God will be my god oh
[1:31:58] Hallelujah your home will be my home
[1:32:00] where you live I'll live where you die
[1:32:02] I'll die why because Naomi was a
[1:32:06] beacon a Shining Light of
[1:32:12] Purity um where's my Gizmo all right
[1:32:15] let's let's have let's have that
[1:32:18] now almost home part two
[1:32:26] Hallelujah all right let me just keep up
[1:32:28] with myself
[1:32:31] now I've built this PowerPoint in a
[1:32:34] funny way I've built it on purpose to
[1:32:39] go really
[1:32:42] slow really
[1:32:44] slow because I want what you're going to
[1:32:47] read to sink in
[1:32:55] we start in the church age
[1:32:59] book Revelation chapter 1 the revelation
[1:33:03] of Jesus Christ now you're about to read
[1:33:07] the
[1:33:08] words that God's singular Vindicated
[1:33:14] proven to be prophet of the age
[1:33:20] says going
[1:33:22] slow I want that to sink in there's no
[1:33:26] arguing with the one God sends that's
[1:33:29] right he sends him to stop argument he
[1:33:33] sends him to to put down debate he sends
[1:33:37] him to Vanquish
[1:33:39] reasoning
[1:33:42] see in Revelation
[1:33:45] 153 it says and they sing the song of
[1:33:49] Moses the servant of God and the song of
[1:33:51] of the lamb
[1:33:53] saying great and marvelous are thy Works
[1:33:56] Lord God
[1:33:58] Almighty just and true are thy ways Thou
[1:34:03] King of saints that's a pretty wonderful
[1:34:07] scripture I'm glad he's king of
[1:34:12] saints ready for the next
[1:34:15] one do you see
[1:34:18] it the lamb the high priest
[1:34:22] holding his blood as an atonement on The
[1:34:24] Mercy Seat for our sins is the Lord God
[1:34:29] Almighty am we could just go home that
[1:34:32] right
[1:34:35] there that is his present office don't
[1:34:39] let anyone tell you he's not still
[1:34:41] interceding for sins that is his present
[1:34:46] office that is what he is doing now
[1:34:51] pleading his blood for our
[1:34:56] sins everybody say hallelujah hallelujah
[1:34:59] thank
[1:35:02] God but one
[1:35:05] day that lamb will become the lion of
[1:35:08] the tribe of
[1:35:12] Judah he will come forth in power and
[1:35:16] glory and take his authority to reign as
[1:35:20] king
[1:35:24] he
[1:35:25] is the coming king of this
[1:35:31] Earth of course that does not say he is
[1:35:35] not King now for he is our king king of
[1:35:42] saints right now it is a spiritual
[1:35:47] kingdom are you keeping
[1:35:49] up you with me me right we found out who
[1:35:54] he is what he's doing what his purpose
[1:35:57] is what what's up that's what's up right
[1:36:01] now it's a spiritual Kingdom you with me
[1:36:05] not going too fast am
[1:36:08] I it is not of this world
[1:36:13] system it is not of this world system
[1:36:17] amen what what's not the spiritual
[1:36:19] Kingdom that we're a part of right it's
[1:36:22] not of this world system even as we are
[1:36:26] not of this
[1:36:29] world there's no ambiguity there that's
[1:36:33] as clear as it can even be
[1:36:36] said I I I mean grammarly couldn't even
[1:36:39] improve on
[1:36:41] that it is not of this world system
[1:36:44] what's not our spiritual Kingdom our
[1:36:46] King even as we are not of this
[1:36:50] world that's the reason that's the
[1:36:53] reason that there's a reason yes say oh
[1:36:58] you people are mad there's a method to
[1:36:59] this
[1:37:01] madness that's the
[1:37:03] reason we act different from the world
[1:37:07] we do sure why because we're not of it
[1:37:11] what are we part of a spiritual Kingdom
[1:37:13] what is that about there's a king he's
[1:37:15] our father and we're here in service to
[1:37:19] him I didn't start here I'm not
[1:37:21] finishing here my life is not about here
[1:37:24] my life is about
[1:37:26] there this life only counts if you get
[1:37:29] to live it eternally what's life even
[1:37:31] worth if you don't live
[1:37:33] eternally it's a few days in full of
[1:37:36] trouble it's hardship and heartache and
[1:37:39] pain what's it worth if you don't get to
[1:37:42] live eternally in a Happy Land with no
[1:37:45] stress and no taxes and no anxiety and
[1:37:48] no bad neighbors and no loud music and
[1:37:51] no traffic rage and no government no
[1:37:54] nothing Hallelujah nothing to worry
[1:37:57] about no sorrow to be sorry
[1:38:02] for that's the reason we act different
[1:38:04] from the world I can only conclude when
[1:38:07] people who are supposed to be Believers
[1:38:10] act like the world they either don't
[1:38:12] realize they're part of a kingdom or
[1:38:14] they don't want to be part of the
[1:38:17] Kingdom I don't know maybe they come
[1:38:20] here CU they just like me maybe they
[1:38:21] like the way sister Debbie dresses me
[1:38:23] maybe they like the way brother Anthony
[1:38:24] sings I don't know it's a great singing
[1:38:27] Sister Debbie does a good
[1:38:34] job our
[1:38:37] citizenship it ain't
[1:38:40] here it's in
[1:38:44] heaven I'm so glad to hear y'all
[1:38:49] pulling we
[1:38:52] reflect the spirit of the world of our
[1:38:56] rebirth where Jesus is the
[1:38:59] king see just like Israel they were to
[1:39:02] be a
[1:39:03] reflection to the world we reflect the
[1:39:07] spirit of the world of our rebirth where
[1:39:11] Jesus is the king that is poetry that is
[1:39:13] so beautiful that just rolls off the
[1:39:16] tongue we reflect the spirit of the
[1:39:18] world of our rebirth where Jesus is the
[1:39:21] king why are y'all so
[1:39:25] different why why are y'all so
[1:39:27] weird why are yall so not like everybody
[1:39:32] else who wants it who wants to be
[1:39:38] that Jesus will let you be honest if you
[1:39:41] just want to say I don't really want to
[1:39:42] be but I want to
[1:39:46] be that is
[1:39:49] why oh there's a reason yeah that's why
[1:39:52] our women do not dress in men's clothing
[1:39:56] or cut their hair or use all those
[1:40:00] cosmetics and other things that the
[1:40:03] world likes so
[1:40:09] much there's a
[1:40:11] reason sisters born of the Holy Spirit
[1:40:14] don't do those things because they don't
[1:40:16] want to do those things the world wants
[1:40:19] to do those things because they're not
[1:40:21] Sisters in Christ they're human beings
[1:40:24] they could become Sisters in Christ if
[1:40:26] you'd witnessed to them
[1:40:28] correctly I I if if your life didn't
[1:40:31] conflict with your
[1:40:32] testimony if your life matched your
[1:40:36] testimony come
[1:40:38] on what good is what good is your lip
[1:40:40] service if your life don't match it how
[1:40:43] you going to witness to somebody in this
[1:40:45] community and they
[1:40:46] go do you see what you're saying versus
[1:40:49] what you are
[1:40:53] if if what y'all have is the truth then
[1:40:55] why does uh you
[1:40:59] know that's that is why our men don't
[1:41:03] drink and smoke and carry on in sin
[1:41:05] there's a reason for
[1:41:09] it our Dominion I love it is the
[1:41:14] dominion
[1:41:16] over
[1:41:18] sin I'm not under it and I'm not in a
[1:41:22] treaty with it I'm not alongside it I'm
[1:41:25] not compromising I'm not sitting in its
[1:41:28] camp and it's not in my Camp I have a
[1:41:30] dominion over
[1:41:35] sin it is enforced through the power
[1:41:40] that is in the spirit of Christ that
[1:41:43] indwells
[1:41:45] us every Kingdom on Earth is going to be
[1:41:49] torn down but ours will
[1:41:54] remain ours will
[1:41:58] remain Hallelujah who want to be a part
[1:42:00] of that
[1:42:05] Kingdom you give me about 15 more
[1:42:08] minutes I got two more slides I want
[1:42:10] three more slides I want to show
[1:42:13] you so our commission from the
[1:42:16] Lord is to reflect this reality to the
[1:42:20] Fallen World
[1:42:22] so you say what what reality that the
[1:42:24] Spirit uh that we that we manifest is
[1:42:28] the spirit of our rebirth we actually
[1:42:30] demonstrate to them we actually
[1:42:33] demonstrate to them that there is
[1:42:35] another actual world besides this
[1:42:38] one and it's
[1:42:41] real and it and and it's a reflection we
[1:42:45] are to be a reflection of that higher
[1:42:49] life
[1:42:52] saywell you know we got nice smiley
[1:42:54] people and wholesome values and we pay
[1:42:56] our taxes and we don't lie and cheat the
[1:42:58] Mormons do the same
[1:43:00] thing put some of you to shame don't
[1:43:02] even get me started on the Amish it's
[1:43:05] not about that friends it's about a
[1:43:07] complete reflection of the Holiness that
[1:43:10] started in the Garden of Eden it ought
[1:43:13] to be more on display now that the world
[1:43:15] is further away from it and more
[1:43:17] perverted and more Twisted we are to
[1:43:19] have such a display of Holiness on
[1:43:22] purpose a willingness to lay aside the
[1:43:26] weights and sins that beset us and
[1:43:30] Skip walk this race jog this race
[1:43:35] run this
[1:43:38] race because our duty as commissioned by
[1:43:41] the
[1:43:42] Lord is to Showcase did you know you are
[1:43:46] a
[1:43:47] showcase to Showcase this corrupt world
[1:43:51] the essence of the world that we are
[1:43:54] reborn into we
[1:43:57] must and I'm being very careful on my
[1:44:00] notes I thought what I want to say very
[1:44:03] carefully we
[1:44:06] must exhibit to them that there exists a
[1:44:11] different
[1:44:13] world a world that is as real as this
[1:44:16] one and even more real our aim is to re
[1:44:21] why I am a believer why I am a preacher
[1:44:25] why I constantly put it on you because
[1:44:29] our aim why do we have a church our aim
[1:44:32] is to reflect the superior way of living
[1:44:36] while down
[1:44:40] here consider the
[1:44:45] contradiction just for a moment stop
[1:44:48] don't think about Walmart or the NFL
[1:44:50] just just
[1:44:56] stop consider the
[1:44:59] contradiction that
[1:45:01] arises from God's
[1:45:04] plan and how confusing it is to The
[1:45:08] Sinner if your clothing your speech your
[1:45:14] behavior do not reflect does not reflect
[1:45:18] the spirit of the world
[1:45:21] that you were reborn
[1:45:23] into but instead resembles the outside
[1:45:27] world that you are meant to stand apart
[1:45:31] from think of the
[1:45:36] contradiction this is exactly where
[1:45:38] Israel stood all those centuries ago
[1:45:42] Moses read to them the law from Mount
[1:45:44] SII and the outside world was filled
[1:45:47] with sin perversion and idolatry
[1:45:51] and you just have to wonder my goodness
[1:45:53] how had Humanity who had started in such
[1:45:56] Perfection how did it get that
[1:45:59] way my you know this is exactly why God
[1:46:02] wanted Israel to be a
[1:46:04] loudspeaker this exactly why he wanted
[1:46:06] them to be a beacon he wanted them to be
[1:46:08] a public address system he wanted them
[1:46:10] to be a living example to the world a
[1:46:13] living example of another
[1:46:15] world 2,000 years from Noah to Jesus
[1:46:20] found Israel steeped in failure in this
[1:46:23] Mission even picking up great men like
[1:46:26] Abraham and David and Elijah and finally
[1:46:29] John and now 2,000 years from Jerusalem
[1:46:34] to
[1:46:35] leoda uh the New Testament Church has
[1:46:38] once again
[1:46:40] failed Christ has found her as an
[1:46:43] adulterous woman she is a living
[1:46:48] catastrophe even picking up Great Men
[1:46:51] along the way like Paul and Luther and
[1:46:54] Wesley are our early fathers of the
[1:46:57] auser Revival finally the Pentecostal
[1:47:01] movement itself which of course has now
[1:47:03] sits in complete ruin today Mega
[1:47:06] Ministries all these Mega Ministries
[1:47:08] like we've been talking about the the
[1:47:10] hill song Global Hillsong Church
[1:47:13] movement the shameful tele evangelists
[1:47:16] who fly around in their Lear Jets until
[1:47:18] one gets a little low on gas and they
[1:47:20] switch to their other Lear Jet and and
[1:47:23] they live in homes that almost look like
[1:47:25] Royal
[1:47:26] palaces and they tell people God told me
[1:47:29] to buy this jet that's a flat
[1:47:35] lie I mean listen friends it's nonsense
[1:47:38] even even the Asberry Revival is proof
[1:47:41] of this oh I said it oh I said it the
[1:47:45] Asberry Revival is not a move of the
[1:47:48] holy spirit it's a move of a spirit I
[1:47:51] don't deny that but you still got you
[1:47:54] still got bobbed haired women with all
[1:47:56] kinds of Jezebel makeup wearing blue
[1:47:59] jeans with hands in the air praising God
[1:48:02] singing songs that is the Antichrist
[1:48:05] system you've got men who drink and cuss
[1:48:08] and then get in the pull pit and commit
[1:48:10] adultery outside of it that is the
[1:48:12] Antichrist system we don't believe in it
[1:48:15] we don't stand for it we are the pure
[1:48:19] unadulterated Bride of the Lord Jesus
[1:48:23] [Applause]
[1:48:25] Christ professing to be the church they
[1:48:28] do they you know a prophet saw them
[1:48:31] naked dancing in a in an example so
[1:48:35] vulgar Prophet said I had to turn my
[1:48:36] head I couldn't even look at you say
[1:48:38] well brother Jason I don't see it that
[1:48:40] way well firstly uh brother brandham
[1:48:44] didn't see something he was shown
[1:48:47] something that's the first thing he
[1:48:49] didn't see something he didn't come back
[1:48:51] and tell us what he saw he said I was
[1:48:54] shown a preview of The Bride doubt it
[1:48:56] all you want to but I would simply point
[1:48:58] out that you don't have the angel of the
[1:49:00] Lord standing over your shoulder showing
[1:49:02] it to you because he was showing it to
[1:49:04] him because I don't care how you see it
[1:49:07] that's how God sees it God sees it as
[1:49:09] naked idolatry dancing and vulgar but
[1:49:14] the bride had to come in preview one
[1:49:16] more time and there came a group of
[1:49:19] sainted little girls smooth clean
[1:49:22] marching to the step of the
[1:49:25] Gospel this the entire advantage of a
[1:49:28] prophet he's an oracle he's a human
[1:49:29] vessel that the almighty God speaks
[1:49:31] through how do you know the true ones
[1:49:33] from the false ones because he speaks to
[1:49:36] according to all the
[1:49:37] word absolutely that's what a true
[1:49:40] prophet he speaks according to all the
[1:49:42] word and all the pro true prophets
[1:49:44] before him signs and wonders and
[1:49:47] prophecies are just there to attract
[1:49:49] your attention friends but it's the word
[1:49:52] that is the test it's the word that
[1:49:54] comes through those chosen vessels God's
[1:49:57] God's word is committed to them in a
[1:50:00] supernatural way to change you you to
[1:50:04] change you into the version of the
[1:50:07] Living
[1:50:08] Word that's why it comes there's no way
[1:50:11] for you to do it to yourself see so why
[1:50:16] why do you think they don't follow the
[1:50:17] decency and morality teachings of
[1:50:19] William Bren because they they don't
[1:50:21] believe he was that vessel sent by God
[1:50:24] to declare how the Holy Ghost feels
[1:50:26] about their condition they don't believe
[1:50:28] it so I just say today whose side are
[1:50:30] you
[1:50:31] on there's no middle ground sir Moses
[1:50:34] said all who are on the Lord's Side come
[1:50:36] to me and all who are not stay with
[1:50:39] Dayan see and that didn't end well for
[1:50:43] daythan or his family or his children or
[1:50:44] his cattle or
[1:50:47] anybody I mean was was William brandham
[1:50:52] the angel the tour guide the prophet
[1:50:55] from the future who stood there and
[1:50:58] showed John who the was was that
[1:51:01] him or was it
[1:51:03] not see it it's really comes down it's
[1:51:06] that simple either it was him or it
[1:51:09] wasn't him and John tried to worship him
[1:51:10] he refused it said I'm one of the
[1:51:12] prophets he's a prophet from the
[1:51:15] future see so no wonder we say the heart
[1:51:18] that broke on Calvary is
[1:51:21] heartbroken with grief at the gates of
[1:51:23] Eden
[1:51:26] first oh that clock wow what an
[1:51:33] enemy I never preach long so can I just
[1:51:37] keep going a little bit come on
[1:51:40] y'all all right I I Don't Preach long
[1:51:44] let me not make a joke about that
[1:51:48] either I'm not going to out our other
[1:51:51] preachers but I Don't Preach
[1:51:56] long brother brandom describe and I'm
[1:51:59] not going to preach long
[1:52:00] today but I'm not going to be able to
[1:52:02] keep that 15-minute promise I want to
[1:52:03] show you two more slides
[1:52:05] Amen brother brandham describes
[1:52:08] him running through the
[1:52:11] garden when word reached God that his
[1:52:15] children had fallen he didn't send an
[1:52:18] angel he didn't send a message J he did
[1:52:20] he said he came
[1:52:22] himself the desperate search and we
[1:52:25] could have never known this it had not
[1:52:26] had a prophet with prophetic insight to
[1:52:29] to describe to us the desperate search
[1:52:32] for his fallen family brother Ram says
[1:52:35] in the message The Prodigal 1950 and
[1:52:38] here he was
[1:52:40] searching walking running up and down
[1:52:44] through the garden screaming for his
[1:52:46] Lost
[1:52:48] Boy the f father hunting searching for
[1:52:52] the son it should have been the son
[1:52:54] searching for the father and today it's
[1:52:58] just the same just as soon as a man sins
[1:53:00] and instead of coming out and confessing
[1:53:02] his sins before God he'll try to get
[1:53:05] back he'll try to hide behind something
[1:53:07] he'll try to get a self-made
[1:53:09] religion brother R says in 1916 in
[1:53:12] having conferences when God knew that
[1:53:15] shocking state of
[1:53:17] emergency I suppose the first first ever
[1:53:20] come to heaven was when he heard that
[1:53:22] his children was lost and he came
[1:53:25] frantically up and down through the
[1:53:28] garden he went looking under every Bush
[1:53:31] Adam oh my son Adam Where Art
[1:53:38] Thou you know
[1:53:41] he's when God judged the case he he
[1:53:44] didn't he didn't apologize or admit to a
[1:53:49] poor design God wasn't it wasn't some
[1:53:51] poor design it was heartbreak his heart
[1:53:54] was
[1:53:56] broken from
[1:53:58] Wednesday we read for you about the
[1:54:03] change of
[1:54:05] fashion moving from Paris in the early
[1:54:09] part of the 20th century and moving to
[1:54:13] Hollywood and in the early part of the
[1:54:15] 20th century and how that brother
[1:54:16] Brandon
[1:54:18] prophesied that God would sink Hollywood
[1:54:21] a mile beneath the ocean never said he
[1:54:23] would sink Paris Paris will meet its own
[1:54:26] its own demise in whatever way God
[1:54:29] chooses but he said Hollywood he would
[1:54:31] sink Hollywood a mile beneath the
[1:54:36] ocean the first motion picture
[1:54:40] Studio did you
[1:54:43] know was not actually on the west coast
[1:54:46] it wasn't in California at all it was
[1:54:48] actually on the east coast in New Jersey
[1:54:51] and it was actually built for
[1:54:53] science the world's first Film
[1:54:57] Production
[1:54:58] Studio was a studio called black
[1:55:01] Maria which was completed in
[1:55:04] 1893 on the grounds of Edison's
[1:55:08] Laboratories in West Orange New Jersey
[1:55:11] the studio was built for the purpose of
[1:55:13] making film strips for the uh
[1:55:17] kinetoscope which was invented by Thomas
[1:55:21] Edison and his assistant William
[1:55:28] Dickinson this is the earliest Motion
[1:55:31] Pictures were shot inside the black
[1:55:35] Maria using natural sunlight to film the
[1:55:39] roof of the black Maria was cranked open
[1:55:42] to admit the light and the entire Studio
[1:55:45] rotated on Wheels 15° every hour to
[1:55:48] track the Sun
[1:55:50] is automated it stayed stayed with the
[1:55:52] moving of the
[1:55:54] Sun the the black Maria was a tar paper
[1:55:58] covered dark studio room with a
[1:56:02] retractable roof cost 600
[1:56:04] bucks yeah and in their
[1:56:07] $637 to build the first now watch this
[1:56:12] so the the the reason it was
[1:56:15] invented was for progress and Science
[1:56:18] and invention so Med could test his new
[1:56:22] Contraption the
[1:56:24] industrial uh uh Revolution was underway
[1:56:27] men shall run to and fro and knowledge
[1:56:29] shall increase that's the prophecy of
[1:56:31] the end time that mankind would get
[1:56:34] wiser but
[1:56:37] weaker so but of course Satan's never
[1:56:40] going to let it stay there soon as
[1:56:42] Edison proved it's working and they got
[1:56:44] a studio then right away Satan sees his
[1:56:48] chance
[1:56:50] see and so we find that the world's
[1:56:53] first Film
[1:56:55] Production he says it that it was uh the
[1:56:58] first motion pictures made in the black
[1:57:01] Maria were deposited for copyright by
[1:57:05] Dickinson at the Library of Congress in
[1:57:06] 1893 the first films shot at the black
[1:57:09] Maria included segments of magic
[1:57:13] shows then plays then
[1:57:16] vaev dancers and strong in then they
[1:57:21] even started showing you know the the
[1:57:23] the the big circus act of Wild Bill Cody
[1:57:26] and and and the wild west show and then
[1:57:28] various boxing matches and then
[1:57:30] fights and then scantily clad
[1:57:36] women the actual first movie studio in
[1:57:41] California was a established by a man by
[1:57:44] the name of C polyscope from Chicago he
[1:57:48] built it in Edendale Los Angeles in
[1:57:52] 1910 the first movie studio in Hollywood
[1:57:57] opened in
[1:57:59] 1912 however it was not until
[1:58:03] 1915 that many major Motion Picture
[1:58:06] companies relocated to Hollywood from
[1:58:10] the East
[1:58:11] Coast as the lightning travels from the
[1:58:15] East unto the West so shall it be your
[1:58:19] SE being a coalescing starts on the East
[1:58:22] Coast with an invention now they're
[1:58:24] building it it's not in Hollywood
[1:58:26] exactly but it's in on the west coast
[1:58:28] but now it's going to be in Hollywood
[1:58:29] and now everybody's moving to Hollywood
[1:58:31] and now the Fashions are starting to be
[1:58:34] now we're not going to Paris anymore
[1:58:36] this is the first part of the 20th
[1:58:37] century
[1:58:39] 1912
[1:58:41] 1912 was the year of the
[1:58:45] Bob when women started cutting their
[1:58:47] hair they never used to do that
[1:58:50] Christian Church taught against women
[1:58:51] cutting their hair for 2 th000 almost
[1:58:52] 2,000 years but the modern day they
[1:58:56] started bobbing off their hair is a sign
[1:58:57] of Independence this is the truth this
[1:58:59] is
[1:59:00] historical and and when you and then by
[1:59:04] 1915 they're all starting to group in
[1:59:06] there together and now the trend is
[1:59:08] starting to change now let me let me let
[1:59:11] me lift you up out of history and take
[1:59:14] you into prophecy can I do that for just
[1:59:16] five
[1:59:18] minutes you you find that under the
[1:59:23] fourth trumpet which governed the
[1:59:25] politics of the world because it's got
[1:59:27] to get Israel home the trumpets are
[1:59:29] about
[1:59:30] Israel you've you've got the sun won't
[1:59:32] shine anymore and the Moon is darken and
[1:59:34] the Stars won't give their light and
[1:59:36] brother Brandon breaks that down to show
[1:59:37] that's the backsliding of the church
[1:59:39] it's starting to go the sun's not
[1:59:41] shining the the the church is going dark
[1:59:43] the Stars aren't shining sons of God who
[1:59:45] are supposed to shine and then what
[1:59:47] happens right around the turn of the
[1:59:50] century what what does God do to counter
[1:59:52] that because when the enemy comes in
[1:59:54] like a flood he raises a standard and
[1:59:57] while that's happening in the world God
[1:59:59] brings uh some some old Pentecostal
[2:00:01] fathers and and they come to isusa
[2:00:04] Street to the apostolic mission on isua
[2:00:07] Street in in Los Angeles California and
[2:00:10] they're going to have the isua
[2:00:14] Revival and God breaks it out prophet's
[2:00:16] not even on the scene he's not even born
[2:00:18] yet and God now is going to bring his
[2:00:21] last movement to the church and he's
[2:00:24] holding one star in his right hand
[2:00:27] waiting and then the fifth trumpet
[2:00:30] begins to commence and when a fifth
[2:00:32] trumpet starts because now what's it
[2:00:34] doing it's all about getting Israel home
[2:00:36] so it starts changing world events
[2:00:38] remember the seals are for the bride the
[2:00:40] trumpets are for the Jews you've got wo
[2:00:43] and you've got vials and every time a
[2:00:45] trumpet sounds a vial partially a
[2:00:48] judgment a trumpet partially opens a
[2:00:50] vile judgment partially opens that's why
[2:00:54] when you read you know under the Sixth
[2:00:57] trumpet where it's dries up the river
[2:01:00] Euphrates under the Sixth vial it's a
[2:01:03] plague that strikes the Euphrates so
[2:01:05] they run hand in hand you you got me
[2:01:09] you're with me I don't want to go too
[2:01:11] fast so now you're at
[2:01:14] 19 now you're at at 197 1910 1912
[2:01:19] 1915 you've got a coalescing of
[2:01:22] Hollywood it's starting to pull from
[2:01:25] Paris and women are starting to Bob
[2:01:27] their hair and then you come under the
[2:01:28] fifth trumpet and under the fifth vial
[2:01:31] and what happens under the fifth trumpet
[2:01:33] you have a star falling from heaven and
[2:01:37] a prophet takes it back to Isaiah and
[2:01:38] says oh Lucifer son of the morning how
[2:01:41] how Thou Art fallen from Heaven which
[2:01:43] did weaken the
[2:01:45] Nations so you've got Lucifer now and
[2:01:48] he's what is he doing he's been released
[2:01:50] down into the Earth and he's given a set
[2:01:52] of keys he hasn't had in his hand since
[2:01:54] Calvary he's got keys to hell to the
[2:01:57] bottomless pit Jesus had had them for
[2:01:59] 2,000 years said now I've got to start
[2:02:01] moving things along so here you go go
[2:02:04] down into the world I need it to be more
[2:02:06] evil than it
[2:02:07] is and he falls from heaven with a key
[2:02:10] to the bottomless pit and opens the
[2:02:13] bottomless pit and when brother Brandon
[2:02:15] picks that up he says the lid has come
[2:02:18] off of Heaven
[2:02:19] and demon powers are streaming into the
[2:02:22] Earth and then immediately what do you
[2:02:25] have you have the First wall the second
[2:02:27] wall the third wall you've got a fifth
[2:02:28] vial coming down and and and it says
[2:02:32] that out of this pit rose up these
[2:02:35] creatures that they they look like
[2:02:38] scorpions but they they had long hair
[2:02:41] like women and Stingers in their tails
[2:02:43] and they looked like lions and they flew
[2:02:45] and they they tormented and a prophet
[2:02:47] said notice that they had long hair to
[2:02:52] torment the women who had cut theirs off
[2:02:55] they'd only cut theirs off recently in
[2:02:58] 1912 and now you've got this fifth
[2:03:00] trumpet and a fifth vial breaking and
[2:03:02] now you've got the lid torn from hell
[2:03:04] and demon powers are going to make the
[2:03:06] world more evil because now we got to
[2:03:07] come to world war never happened there's
[2:03:10] got to be way more evil in the world or
[2:03:12] it's never going to get pulled pulled it
[2:03:14] off you understand this just off top of
[2:03:17] my head I hope you you're staying up I
[2:03:19] can't I can't take too much time and so
[2:03:22] so then what what does that mean to
[2:03:25] torment the women because in
[2:03:28] 1914 the first woe breaks onto the Earth
[2:03:32] and what does it start World War I and
[2:03:35] what happens to those women they lose
[2:03:41] 116,000 of their husbands and their sons
[2:03:44] to the first
[2:03:46] woe and the ones who came home injured
[2:03:50] and diseased were three times
[2:03:53] that and right as World War I is ending
[2:03:56] because had it not the first one would
[2:03:58] have went one two three and we'd have
[2:04:00] been an armagedon by 1920 and God
[2:04:02] couldn't let that happen he hadn't even
[2:04:05] open the seals yet he's got to keep
[2:04:06] everything moving at the same time and
[2:04:08] if one runs out ahead he says now we got
[2:04:10] to drop back and wait for all this other
[2:04:12] to catch up this is real time this is
[2:04:15] happening you're living in the coming of
[2:04:16] the
[2:04:17] Lord
[2:04:19] and so he so now we we find that that
[2:04:22] what happens is at the end of the the
[2:04:25] woe because why does it stop because it
[2:04:28] stops in 1918 on the 11th month the 11th
[2:04:34] day of the of the 11th month and the
[2:04:37] 11th Hour of the 11th uh day of the 11th
[2:04:42] month because it's got to get the 11th
[2:04:46] Hour worker that Jesus spoke of
[2:04:49] and there's got to be a last bride who
[2:04:52] returns back to the faith of the
[2:04:53] original oh my that's where we are
[2:04:57] friends and God sent forth a prophet to
[2:05:00] accomplish that and dare we minimalize
[2:05:03] you think all this stuff is an accident
[2:05:05] you think God sent an opinion down into
[2:05:08] the Earth
[2:05:11] nonsense what God is doing is
[2:05:13] controlling
[2:05:15] Nations and you want to disqualify
[2:05:18] Propet because of a bridge or a bear
[2:05:23] really that is so
[2:05:26] ignorant my goodness I know what the
[2:05:29] word has done to my life I give this
[2:05:31] message the word
[2:05:33] test I know what it's done to
[2:05:36] me on and at the end of 1918 because God
[2:05:40] stopped it the historically they still
[2:05:41] to this day I don't know who stopped it
[2:05:43] Kaiser wilham said publicly I never
[2:05:45] stopped it the king of England I never
[2:05:48] stopped it well who stopped it well we
[2:05:49] just stopped God stopped
[2:05:51] it but
[2:05:53] because that the judgments weren't
[2:05:56] finished right at the end of
[2:05:59] 1918 the first influenza pandemic Falls
[2:06:04] because it's coming from the fifth vial
[2:06:07] and 30 million people die
[2:06:11] amen and of all the deaths of American
[2:06:16] GIS more than half half of them died of
[2:06:20] that plague they weren't shot they were
[2:06:24] diseased these are the things that God
[2:06:28] has been maneuvering and
[2:06:30] unfolding as we go and then I don't have
[2:06:33] time to run it all the way out to the
[2:06:34] end it's a whole lesson but then a
[2:06:36] prophet comes on the scene born out of
[2:06:38] season God had already spoke to him way
[2:06:41] back here as a boy while he's working in
[2:06:44] Europe while these things are happening
[2:06:46] and then the then the six trumpet sounds
[2:06:49] and then the sixth vial releases
[2:06:51] partially because it's all going to be
[2:06:53] fullness in the tribulation none of it's
[2:06:54] fullness now and then what happens it
[2:06:57] strikes the riv Euphrates and six and
[2:07:00] 200 million demon Chargers are released
[2:07:02] to go after Hitler nikman and go after
[2:07:04] the
[2:07:05] Jews you see friends this stuff you
[2:07:08] can't make that up this stuff hits
[2:07:09] perfect this stuff hits on all cylinders
[2:07:12] I'm here to tell you what God has done
[2:07:14] in this hour is almost
[2:07:17] mindblowing I have time to doubt it I'm
[2:07:19] trying to believe every word of it I
[2:07:22] want to see where it places me and
[2:07:24] positionally and what it tells me is
[2:07:26] that I am the Spotless Bride of the Lord
[2:07:29] Jesus Christ and there's Authority once
[2:07:32] again under the opening of the seventh
[2:07:34] seal there's Authority in the Church of
[2:07:36] Christ while the world has gone off into
[2:07:40] darkness and the Heathen rages against
[2:07:42] it let him rage the Heathen will always
[2:07:44] rage let him
[2:07:47] rage
[2:07:49] I'm going to scroll down to my last
[2:07:51] point and this is at these I want to
[2:07:52] show you these
[2:07:54] slides did you ever
[2:07:58] know that from the
[2:08:02] Apostolic Faith
[2:08:04] Mission on isua street they actually had
[2:08:07] the exact
[2:08:10] number that from the Apostolic Faith
[2:08:14] Mission on isua street in Los Angeles in
[2:08:17] 1907
[2:08:20] did you ever
[2:08:22] know that from that
[2:08:24] mission to
[2:08:26] Hollywood is
[2:08:29] exactly seven
[2:08:34] miles I double verified it and you know
[2:08:37] how how our map systems are these days
[2:08:39] Google or Apple whoever it is it'll give
[2:08:41] you like the middle one will say this is
[2:08:43] your beline and then if you want to go
[2:08:45] around this way and up some back streets
[2:08:46] you might shave a tenth off if you go
[2:08:48] this way you'll add a couple of tents
[2:08:50] depending on you know you can take your
[2:08:52] pick you choose which one but the center
[2:08:55] one always comes up seven miles
[2:09:02] exactly and in this one 69 and 66 I did
[2:09:05] another one and it was 69 and 72 depends
[2:09:08] on which way you want to go but the
[2:09:10] beline route that both Maps recommend if
[2:09:15] you want to go from where the mission
[2:09:16] was where they where where they called
[2:09:19] the fire department because the
[2:09:22] neighbors thought the building was
[2:09:23] engulfed in
[2:09:25] flames wow that's a historical fact they
[2:09:29] called the fire department the fire
[2:09:31] department came and found a building
[2:09:34] engulfed in flames only when they looked
[2:09:36] closely it wasn't on fire at all but it
[2:09:38] was
[2:09:39] glowing and lighting the heavens and
[2:09:41] it's seven
[2:09:43] miles and at this time Hollywood Studios
[2:09:46] don't even exist
[2:09:49] yet they're just on the East Coast it
[2:09:51] hasn't made it West yet it hasn't it
[2:09:54] hasn't come to 1912 yet the woes haven't
[2:09:57] started
[2:09:58] yet but it's seven miles
[2:10:02] exactly to
[2:10:04] Hollywood I'm going to tell you
[2:10:05] something friends you think of a prophet
[2:10:07] now just think for a
[2:10:09] moment and a prophet said he said I near
[2:10:12] the end of his ministry he said I have
[2:10:16] went up and down the Coastline of
[2:10:20] California year after year after year
[2:10:24] and every time I come back it gets
[2:10:28] worse you think of God running up and
[2:10:31] down the Garden of Eden crying for a son
[2:10:33] think of a prophet running up and down
[2:10:36] the coastline as brother brandham
[2:10:38] describes God running up and down the
[2:10:39] Garden of Eden crying
[2:10:41] Adam Adam here he is now here is a
[2:10:47] prophet now
[2:10:48] on the west
[2:10:50] coast it's all come back full circle it
[2:10:54] started at isua it went around the world
[2:10:57] seven times and it's coming back and a
[2:11:00] prophet says he'll sink Hollywood a mile
[2:11:03] beneath the ocean here is a prophet up
[2:11:06] and down the coastline of California the
[2:11:09] last I want to say this clearly hear me
[2:11:11] the last line of defense it's it's it's
[2:11:15] moved Westward and backed up and backed
[2:11:18] up and the Christian Church kept
[2:11:20] backsliding and kept backsliding till
[2:11:22] finally she's at the coast she can't go
[2:11:25] any further you go beyond here and you
[2:11:27] go east again and brother brandom says
[2:11:29] it's walled up and the sin and the
[2:11:32] perversion are all stagnated right there
[2:11:35] along that Coastline and here's a
[2:11:38] prophet he's standing on the last line
[2:11:41] of defense before the love of God is
[2:11:45] overrun by the enemy completely and the
[2:11:48] nation is sealed away to its
[2:11:52] Doom the world has come full circle Back
[2:11:56] to Where it All Began in the last stage
[2:11:59] at isua Street seven miles from
[2:12:03] Hollywood and brother brandham finishes
[2:12:05] with this there stood Adam and
[2:12:08] Eve with their fig leaves sewed together
[2:12:12] behind a bush father I wish you'd go
[2:12:16] home and play the tape this I'm going to
[2:12:18] try to emulate as close I can to brother
[2:12:20] Brandon he's so
[2:12:21] heartbroken father going back and forth
[2:12:24] screaming where are you where are
[2:12:28] you that same God goes up and down the
[2:12:31] aisles night after night screaming the
[2:12:33] same thing where art thou Where Art Thou
[2:12:37] listen friends not Adam I don't know
[2:12:39] where you are where are you hiding God
[2:12:41] knew right where he was it's not that
[2:12:43] it's Adam how did you get here how did
[2:12:47] this happen to you you you were perfect
[2:12:49] I had everything how did you arrive at
[2:12:52] such a place in your life oh Adam my son
[2:12:56] my son you weren't made for this I made
[2:13:00] you as an amateur God you were going to
[2:13:02] rule the galaxies with me we were
[2:13:04] starting a civilization we were building
[2:13:07] a
[2:13:08] kingdom I'm here to tell you God is
[2:13:11] calling you and I back to that original
[2:13:14] creation God is calling us back Eden is
[2:13:18] being
[2:13:19] rebuilt and Adam and Eve are being
[2:13:22] restored Hallelujah friends and you
[2:13:25] can't stop it prophecy is unwinding
[2:13:28] today
[2:13:30] Hallelujah it fell by a loss of faith in
[2:13:33] the word he's building it back by the
[2:13:37] perfect word come Anthony bring your
[2:13:40] team he's building it back by a perfect
[2:13:44] word a restored Faith by rest restored
[2:13:48] word and a restored
[2:13:51] people say brother Jason how do you know
[2:13:55] it'll
[2:13:56] work it's already been
[2:13:59] tested it was tested in
[2:14:02] Jesus he said destroy this temple in
[2:14:06] three days I'll build it back oh friends
[2:14:10] it's already been tested stand to your
[2:14:15] feet with
[2:14:16] me God
[2:14:18] and the day and hour that we live in has
[2:14:23] once again I I I just want to say this
[2:14:26] last closing statement again God how did
[2:14:30] it
[2:14:31] fall by that powerful devious weapon of
[2:14:36] reasoning God's
[2:14:38] word doesn't mean what it says it's not
[2:14:40] incumbent upon me it's just his
[2:14:43] opinion I don't really have to do
[2:14:46] that
[2:14:48] that same
[2:14:50] reasoning is trying like crazy to
[2:14:54] prevent this bride see the second Adam's
[2:14:57] already been restored now all he's got
[2:14:59] to do is get the second Eve restored and
[2:15:02] so how does how did he build the first
[2:15:04] one by his word how's he building the
[2:15:06] second one restoring his original word
[2:15:09] not a new word not a new word there is
[2:15:12] not one thing we teach that's new
[2:15:15] outside of the Bible amen everything
[2:15:17] we're teach teaching is only in the
[2:15:19] scripture it's just a re restoration of
[2:15:21] the teaching that's all the message is
[2:15:24] say what is the message what God said he
[2:15:26] would do what does that mean he'd
[2:15:28] restore the word and he did what does
[2:15:31] that mean means that he's given you a
[2:15:32] way home if you want it he he won't
[2:15:36] force it on you and if you want to
[2:15:37] reason it away you'll do that at your
[2:15:39] own Peril but I cannot help but declare
[2:15:42] the whole counsel of
[2:15:45] God bow your heads with me me all over
[2:15:48] the
[2:15:52] building Lord thank you that I'd like to
[2:15:56] thank you for your grace to me thank you
[2:15:58] for your anointing on the
[2:16:01] word I'd like to thank you for these
[2:16:04] people who have been so very patient and
[2:16:07] allowed me the extra time I needed to
[2:16:09] finish this series I wanted to I felt in
[2:16:11] my heart I should I want to thank you I
[2:16:14] pray you reward them for their patience
[2:16:16] and their pull on the the word of God
[2:16:18] today lord it's not unnoticed by me or
[2:16:22] you and many words were said today quite
[2:16:25] a
[2:16:25] few and it'll definitely take the
[2:16:28] anointing of the Holy Spirit Lord you
[2:16:31] know I'm just a
[2:16:33] man all I can do is preach it and live
[2:16:37] it and try to be the best example of it
[2:16:39] I can it's ultimately Lord up to the
[2:16:43] individual whether they will accept your
[2:16:46] mercy or whether they won't you you
[2:16:47] won't force them
[2:16:50] to but I I know that you will compel
[2:16:53] them you
[2:16:55] will you will convict their hearts you
[2:16:57] will you said that that that when you
[2:17:00] come you would convince the world of
[2:17:03] sin you would convince them that they
[2:17:05] need a savior that they can't get home
[2:17:08] on their own they're hopelessly in chaos
[2:17:12] because of the way they were born
[2:17:14] they're born wrong come into the world
[2:17:16] wrong you're trying to turn everything
[2:17:18] back around you're trying to restore it
[2:17:20] back by the spoken word to the spoken
[2:17:23] word that's the only way that life ever
[2:17:26] did come that's the only way the Earth
[2:17:27] got built that's the only way that Mercy
[2:17:30] was ever extended was through your word
[2:17:33] it doesn't come any other way there's no
[2:17:35] works we can do there's no Deeds
[2:17:37] everybody in this building could go from
[2:17:39] here today and keep everything that I've
[2:17:41] said today to the letter it still
[2:17:42] wouldn't do it they've got to be born
[2:17:44] again they've got to receive Christ in
[2:17:47] into their heart and then he will make
[2:17:49] the changes in
[2:17:51] them Lord I pray today that you will
[2:17:54] make it that real May the people see
[2:17:57] Lord that just as prophecy they can't
[2:17:59] deny
[2:18:01] it I all I did was lay out the
[2:18:04] prophecies out of the Bible and overlay
[2:18:05] it with history that everybody knows
[2:18:07] happened what's to
[2:18:09] deny where where's the room for denial
[2:18:13] if you did all of that how are you not
[2:18:14] doing all of
[2:18:16] this if you sent us a message that
[2:18:18] opened all of that up and opened our
[2:18:20] eyes and we understand it and we see our
[2:18:21] position in Christ then how in the world
[2:18:25] would we not trust it to get us home how
[2:18:28] would we not be ready willing to go
[2:18:31] forward and obey every word of God I
[2:18:35] pray today for all of those under the
[2:18:38] sound of my voice here in this live
[2:18:40] audience th across the airwaves live or
[2:18:43] maybe at a later time through a
[2:18:45] recording I pray that same holy spirit
