[7:00] just coming and ministering to the lives
[7:02] of young people god loves young people
[7:05] and i wanted to encourage you tonight
[7:07] this is just opening comments
[7:09] these are not momentary
[7:11] blessings
[7:12] weekends like this
[7:14] these are eternal
[7:16] sacred moments
[7:18] sacred sands that god has given to you
[7:21] and i that's going to last forever
[7:24] and the effects of these meetings
[7:27] are not temporary
[7:29] we're not here for a weekend flame
[7:33] did anybody say amen i'm not here for a
[7:36] weekend flame
[7:38] and
[7:39] young people these are some of the
[7:41] greatest times of your life
[7:43] and i would encourage you to just drink
[7:45] it all in
[7:48] when i look back over
[7:50] our short life
[7:51] 49 years and going to youth camps from
[7:54] when i was just a little boy myself and
[7:56] milton west milton ohio and
[8:00] ohio area those are the greatest times
[8:02] of our lives
[8:05] and this weekend the ministers that are
[8:07] minister for you
[8:09] i want to encourage each of you young
[8:11] people to look beyond just for now
[8:15] because when we minister to you we're
[8:17] actually ministering and looking into
[8:19] your positive future
[8:21] god's giving the ministry the faithful
[8:23] ministry
[8:25] an anointing
[8:26] to not speak to you just where you're at
[8:28] now but he's they're actually anointed
[8:32] to look beyond the now
[8:34] and preach you into your future
[8:37] so i encourage you to just lay aside
[8:39] every way we're creating a heavenly
[8:42] atmosphere for one another
[8:44] god's breathing hope into you he's
[8:46] breathing faith into you
[8:48] into your future
[8:50] and that's an expected end god looks
[8:52] down the road and he doesn't see you
[8:54] crashed up or
[8:56] missing the rapture but he sees you with
[8:58] an expected inn full of
[9:00] full of peace and full of strength and i
[9:03] just want to say this right at the
[9:04] beginning
[9:06] everything's going to be okay
[9:10] god's got it all in control
[9:12] god's dwelling
[9:14] in the lives and hearts of
[9:16] now
[9:17] we've gone on many years in the message
[9:19] and i'm looking at many of your faces
[9:21] and i know a lot of your fathers and
[9:22] mothers

[22:01] and the fats
[22:03] shall overflow with wine and oil that
[22:06] means the containers those things that
[22:09] are within the house of god wine is
[22:11] stimulation
[22:13] from revelation
[22:15] and oil is a type of the holy ghost that
[22:17] means in our meetings
[22:19] they shouldn't be dead and boring and
[22:21] dry
[22:22] the word ought to be flowing ought to
[22:24] bring stimulation
[22:26] to young people to teenagers to people
[22:29] in their 20s there ought to be joy
[22:31] and excitement at the hearing of the
[22:33] word
[22:35] no we're not at a football game or
[22:37] a
[22:38] rock concert we're not shopping tonight
[22:41] and we're not in a spa we are on the
[22:43] front lines
[22:44] battling the enemy enemy but we are
[22:47] victorious
[22:48] and in that atmosphere is going to be
[22:51] stimulation it's going to be the holy
[22:53] ghost coming to young hearts the same
[22:56] experience that your mother's
[22:58] got and your father's got and your
[23:00] minister's god and i i met him in my
[23:02] motel room they love to be here tonight
[23:05] brother matthew mother jason if we would
[23:07] have had a a building for six seven
[23:09] hundred people i think there would have
[23:10] been people that would have driven and
[23:12] come here to be in these services
[23:15] but it's mostly young people
[23:18] here we are tonight almost just 400 of
[23:20] us god has brought us together for such
[23:24] a time as this for different churches
[23:26] and different families
[23:28] and different walks of life because he
[23:31] predestinated
[23:32] and he knows that restoration is going
[23:35] through this building right now
[23:37] the same fire of god that birth your
[23:39] parents that came maybe years ago in
[23:42] their meetings and in their services my
[23:44] wife gave her a heart to the lord in a
[23:47] meeting in new zealand when brother
[23:48] donnie reagan and brother uh harold
[23:51] gilderbrandt was preaching she'd been
[23:53] raised in a christian home her father
[23:55] was a pastor but there came a certain
[23:58] day
[23:59] when the lights came on
[24:02] and we can be in the message brother
[24:03] john was raised in the branham
[24:05] tabernacle from a little boy heard the
[24:08] words of william branham
[24:12] but there had to come a day
[24:14] when the lights came on
[24:16] just a 12 year old boy a month before i
[24:19] was 13.
[24:20] they said is there anyone here that
[24:22] would like to be baptized and i raised
[24:24] my hand and i was baptized that night
[24:27] brother elliot and i have never been the
[24:29] same from that night i remember going
[24:33] back to school the next morning there
[24:34] wasn't
[24:35] pillars of fire there weren't angels but
[24:38] i just knew that something was different
[24:41] i had done what the word had asked us to
[24:43] do
[24:44] and from that time it's just been a
[24:46] growth this has been a seasons and i i
[24:49] feel i really had my word birth some
[24:52] years later as we were under the impact
[24:55] of the word of god at cloverdale bible
[24:57] ways
[24:58] and as in a little love church many
[25:00] young people and hearts had come to the
[25:03] lord and people were moving because
[25:05] there was a stir of god and there was
[25:07] life within the assembly just like i
[25:10] since right now in this meeting i just
[25:12] feel the pulsation of the holy spirit
[25:15] it's the prayers of others that are like
[25:17] odors coming before the lord
[25:21] i believe in those prayers
[25:24] and we see in verse 12 25
[25:27] god sent in a prophecy
[25:29] of i will restore to you the years do we
[25:33] have that on the street
[25:35] i will restore
[25:38] to you the years just keep that up that
[25:40] brothers restoration this is our title
[25:44] i will restore means i'm going to bring
[25:46] back to you
[25:49] your ought to be conditioned
[25:51] i'm going to bring you back
[25:53] to where you ought to be
[25:56] let's all say restoration
[25:59] re-store
[26:01] is like
[26:02] repentance or revival you've heard all
[26:06] of these phrases revival repentance
[26:08] redemption is christ bringing you out of
[26:13] but it's him taking you into
[26:16] it's two parts it's god bringing you out
[26:18] of the world out of yourself
[26:21] now 20 years ago would have been at
[26:23] conventions and meetings and they said
[26:25] come out of denominations come out of
[26:28] baptist come out of catholic come out of
[26:30] pentecostal denominations most young
[26:33] people in the message don't even know
[26:34] what a denomination is
[26:36] so it's time that the ministry today
[26:38] jump down into
[26:41] the ditches as it was and start to talk
[26:43] the language of the hearts that we can
[26:46] connect with this new generation
[26:50] to be able to say things that will
[26:51] connect with our hearts
[26:53] not their minds
[26:55] but in their hearts they can see that
[26:57] god's alive
[26:59] he's present
[27:01] not just by pictures or quoting but to
[27:04] be able to bring that presence so near
[27:07] that they can want what we've got
[27:10] that they can desire the god that not
[27:13] that we're pointing to but we're
[27:15] bringing him to them
[27:20] [Applause]
[27:22] so restore means to bring back it means
[27:25] to bring you back to your place that god
[27:28] had in his mind about you
[27:32] it is him coming to you at your season
[27:36] at your time
[27:39] and making it so real for you
[27:43] let's look in verse 25 and i will
[27:45] restore to you the years that the
[27:47] locusts have eaten the tank worm and the
[27:49] caterpillar and the palm oil my great
[27:51] army which i sent among you
[27:56] and you shall eden plenty verse 26.
[27:59] have you enjoyed the food here at the
[28:01] camp here is everybody doing okay
[28:04] breakfast lunch supper did y'all eat
[28:06] okay today
[28:07] half of you did y'all eat okay today
[28:10] brother john bypass those couple meals
[28:12] so i could be in better shape for you
[28:14] tonight but we're talking spiritually
[28:17] verse 26 you shall eat in plenty
[28:20] and be satisfied
[28:22] and praise the name of the lord your god
[28:24] that hath dwell wondrously with you i
[28:27] just want to speak to you just for a
[28:29] moment has god been wonderful to you
[28:32] has god been good to you
[28:35] i mean what more can god do for us to
[28:38] get us ready to go in the rapture
[28:41] is anybody listening tonight
[28:43] what more ministry what more effects i
[28:46] mean
[28:47] some of you come from homes maybe that
[28:49] are broken or in trouble
[28:51] but i i speak for most of you you have a
[28:54] pretty good life
[28:59] it's comfortable god has met your needs
[29:04] more than enough in fact we become so
[29:07] unthankful and we take things for
[29:09] granted and i pray that in meetings like
[29:11] this god would just break that out of us
[29:13] that we would say god i acknowledge you
[29:16] and what you've done in my life
[29:18] you've worked wondrously with you and
[29:20] verse
[29:21] 26 says and my people shall never be
[29:25] ashamed
[29:30] my young people
[29:32] shall never be ashamed
[29:36] i'm not adding to the word i'm bringing
[29:38] bethel tabernacle youth right into it
[29:40] now there's no reason for you to be
[29:42] ashamed i have this later in my notes
[29:44] but i might as well just say it right
[29:46] now you know as ministers we deal in the
[29:48] last years or so with prayer lines and
[29:50] secret expressions when young people
[29:52] come to the front and we hear a lot
[29:54] about suicide we hear a lot about the
[29:57] spirits that would satan would try to
[29:59] plague the young people with in our
[30:02] generation pornography
[30:04] wrong music and wrong movies
[30:07] they battle fashion they battle how they
[30:10] look and and the perception of others
[30:12] they you know their nails or their looks
[30:14] and their face and or how they just look
[30:17] and it just seems like satan has put an
[30:19] epidemic on young people to care about
[30:23] how you look so much more that they lose
[30:26] their the appetite in that real how does
[30:29] god think about you
[30:31] but i just want to say tonight you are
[30:33] accepted in the beloved
[30:36] our sisters don't have to wear makeup or
[30:38] cut their hair to be beautiful
[30:41] [Applause]
[30:47] i think we just ought to knock that
[30:49] suicide spirit right out of the building
[30:52] we've been in a lot of prayer lines this
[30:53] last year so after this covet pandemic
[30:56] has come through it's not a local thing
[30:58] it's a global thing i just got back from
[31:00] europe i had to be tested three times
[31:02] for that one trip two times going and
[31:05] one time coming i know what it's like
[31:06] and my wife sits back there probably
[31:08] more tested than anybody in this room
[31:10] probably without exaggeration crossing
[31:13] back and forth into canada to see our
[31:15] daughter a lot but let me tell you what
[31:17] friends suicide has tried to plug the
[31:20] young people of the message satan trying
[31:22] to tell you your life is worthless or
[31:25] just take your life
[31:26] and you're no good and i'm here tonight
[31:28] to tell you god loves you
[31:30] you're accepted in the beloved
[31:44] life is worth living god sees beyond the
[31:47] now he's trying to lift up your eyes out
[31:49] of the dust and out of just the now that
[31:52] you're seeing and look above look above
[31:54] the now catch a vision of the word
[31:57] it's continuing it's passing through
[32:00] this building right now
[32:02] that's our title of restoration
[32:04] continues i've heard it over and over
[32:06] young men and even young ladies
[32:09] plagued with pornography and looking at
[32:11] things that are not right let me tell
[32:13] you what friends that is not an
[32:15] attribute of the holy spirit
[32:17] homosexuality lesbianism
[32:20] beastology whatever you satan may try to
[32:22] plague your mind with is not of the holy
[32:24] ghost
[32:25] and it's meetings like this we need to
[32:27] say it
[32:31] it can be right in the room and people
[32:32] are afraid to talk about it
[32:34] ministers afraid to say it
[32:37] and i pray god help all of us from the
[32:39] youngest to the oldest there's no big
[32:41] eyes or little you there's not a person
[32:43] in this service or streaming the service
[32:46] that's better than anybody else
[32:49] you might be down the road you might
[32:51] have traveled in the message but we need
[32:53] to learn to humble ourselves and knock
[32:55] out all that arrogancy and pride
[32:58] you say well i've been there done that
[32:59] no you haven't
[33:01] i just read a quote today of brother
[33:03] branham he said our children our sons do
[33:06] you know that your boys fathers have it
[33:09] ten times worse than you ever had
[33:12] that's a quote of brother branham i had
[33:14] it on my wall for years in my office
[33:17] just to always remind us
[33:20] as we've spoken to a lot of young people
[33:21] over the years
[33:24] they have it 10 times harder than i ever
[33:27] did
[33:28] and then if you're if you have
[33:29] grandchildren that's 10 times 10
[33:32] what is it for our grandchildren i'm
[33:34] speaking to the children of the children
[33:36] in the message
[33:38] we have not been there we have not done
[33:40] that
[33:41] brother john stands in the pulpit
[33:43] tonight
[33:44] i've never drank i've never smoked i've
[33:46] never took drugs
[33:48] but you i'm looking in the faces of a
[33:50] generation that has it much harder than
[33:53] i ever had
[33:54] you're dealing with things emotionally
[33:56] when you're eight years old and 10 years
[33:58] old things that are putting blatant out
[34:00] there when brother john would have had
[34:02] to go to a store or go to a special
[34:04] place to look into it's at the
[34:06] fingertips of our children and our sons
[34:09] and i say god save our young people
[34:12] send down the holy spirit so strong in
[34:15] our meanings
[34:17] that while the waters being stirred
[34:28] joel chapter 1 verse 26 the last part of
[34:31] it says
[34:33] and my people shall never be ashamed
[34:37] verse 27 and ye shall know that i am in
[34:39] the midst of israel that i am the lord
[34:41] your god and none else and my people
[34:43] shall never be ashamed
[34:46] and this message came forth with
[34:48] shouting crying grace grace it's like a
[34:52] double portion it's like god knew that
[34:54] we needed not just grace we need grace
[34:57] grace
[34:58] i'm standing here on august i'm sorry
[35:00] october the 29th saying we need grace
[35:05] but we need grace grace
[35:07] and the message of the hour will meet in
[35:10] time conditions
[35:12] the holy spirit is standing there
[35:13] tonight with his sword drawn
[35:16] to defeat the enemy
[35:19] and if you feel the least tug
[35:21] of his spirit don't turn it away
[35:25] if you just feel the least little desire
[35:27] for god i would respond to that
[35:30] how many believe in miracles just raise
[35:32] your hand
[35:34] how many have a desire for more of god
[35:37] do you know what friends that is a
[35:39] miracle
[35:42] you all believe in miracles we just saw
[35:44] a lot of miracles
[35:46] young ladies and young men and a whole
[35:48] room full of people that actually want
[35:50] god
[35:55] lord we love you
[35:56] tonight lord jesus we want to serve you
[35:59] with all of our hearts
[36:01] yes
[36:03] my people shall never be ashamed verse
[36:06] 28 excuse me for taking this time but
[36:08] this is probably going to be our last
[36:10] scripture before we go to our sides
[36:12] and it shall come to pass afterward
[36:16] and i will pour out my spirit upon all
[36:18] flesh and your sons
[36:20] and your daughters shall prophesy
[36:25] how many can read that in the bible they
[36:27] shall prophesy
[36:28] not cussing not swearing
[36:32] not the newest movie not the latest chad
[36:35] they're going to be caught up in a
[36:36] spirit of prophecy sons and daughters in
[36:39] the message your old men shall dream
[36:42] dreams
[36:43] and your young men shall see visions
[36:47] and it's not television or it's not
[36:49] gaming or it's not you too
[36:53] but it's a vision
[36:54] of the holy spirit it's god breaking
[36:57] through
[36:58] it's better than a basketball star
[37:01] or a football player when he takes off
[37:03] his helmet he's got big earrings and
[37:05] tattoos all up and he's on his second or
[37:07] third girlfriend our wife and he's an
[37:09] abuser
[37:11] god's given us brothers and sisters in
[37:13] this room that love you we love one
[37:15] another
[37:24] verse 28 speaks about afterward all
[37:28] these things
[37:29] after the
[37:30] uh tanker worm locust caterpillar and
[37:33] palmer worm has tried to eat away after
[37:34] all these things i'm going to pour out
[37:36] my spirit in verse 29
[37:38] also upon the servants and upon the
[37:40] handmaids and in this those days will i
[37:43] pour out my spirit the campers the
[37:45] counselors the team the ministers
[37:48] the fathers the mothers
[37:51] those that would love to be here in this
[37:52] service but they're streaming or will
[37:54] see this service
[37:56] i will show verse 30 wonders in heavens
[37:58] and in the earth blood and fire and
[38:00] pillars of smoke the sun shall be turned
[38:02] into darkness and the moon and the blood
[38:05] before the great and
[38:07] terrible day of the lord come and it
[38:09] shall come to pass that whosoever let's
[38:11] all say whosoever
[38:13] brother brother said that word whosoever
[38:16] it means you
[38:18] because if he would have said john or
[38:20] mary or susan or wesley and someone
[38:24] else's name could have been wesley or
[38:26] susan he said whosoever
[38:30] shall call on the name of the lord
[38:34] shall be delivered
[38:36] this scripture is so powerful
[38:38] it's it's quoted again in acts chapter 2
[38:42] whosoever shall call upon the name of
[38:44] the lord shall be saved
[38:46] it's quoted again in romans whosoever
[38:49] shall call upon the name of the lord not
[38:51] maybe not hope so now i'll watch you
[38:54] after camp for about a week or so and
[38:56] see if it was just an emotion no
[38:58] whosoever shall call upon the name of
[39:01] the lord
[39:02] [Applause]
[39:04] i don't think you're getting it tonight
[39:06] shall be saved
[39:08] [Applause]
[39:11] brothers if you can bring up our slides
[39:13] i wanted to now
[39:15] continue in this story this service

[43:23] spiritual
[43:24] contractions
[43:27] it's holy first inside of a person
[43:31] and they can't explain it and they can't
[43:33] time it
[43:34] it's just happening it's god
[43:36] moving saying now is the time now is the
[43:40] hour now is the season i put the seed
[43:43] there but now it's time for it to be
[43:45] born
[43:47] i will restore as a promise in joel
[43:50] peter picked it up on the day of
[43:52] pentecost saying this is that
[43:55] now i'm bringing it up to 2021 saying
[43:58] the same holy ghost was moving now
[44:00] globally
[44:03] we see it now on the refrigerator who's
[44:06] ever been in the refrigerator before
[44:08] about half of you come on everyone
[44:12] this is a believer's youth camp amen
[44:19] we want to see
[44:20] it we want to hear it
[44:24] we're going to put it before them this
[44:25] is fulfilling
[44:27] deuteronomy put it on your bed post talk
[44:29] about it
[44:30] in your uprising when you go through the
[44:32] house
[44:34] it's not all about your job it's not all
[44:36] about your career it's not all about
[44:38] your good looks can you imagine staring
[44:40] into a mirror every morning and saying i
[44:43] will restore screaming back at you
[44:47] you talk about the love of god
[44:50] it's a lot better than rock and roll
[44:52] music playing through the house
[44:55] come on young people it's a it's a lot
[44:56] better than a mother cursing you and
[44:58] telling you you're no good you're never
[45:00] gonna amount to nothing
[45:03] it's a lot better than what brother
[45:05] williams had to deal with in his
[45:07] testimony
[45:10] of a father standing with a gun
[45:14] wanting to destroy life i doubt there's
[45:16] a handful of people that's ever even
[45:19] seen a father take a gun and point it at
[45:21] their mother
[45:23] brother burly williams did
[45:26] we stand here as witnesses
[45:29] i will restore i'm going to bring you
[45:31] back i'm going to bring all of those
[45:32] hurts and all of that pain
[45:35] all of that broken heartedness and all
[45:37] that loneliness that you've been dealing
[45:39] with even in this last year and a half i
[45:43] will restore i'm going to bring it all
[45:45] back to you in the same season
[45:56] oh it's on the refrigerators
[45:59] it's on the windows you kind of look out
[46:00] through the trees
[46:02] you're trying to look out the window
[46:03] brother jason and you see something
[46:06] written on the way i will restore say
[46:08] the lord
[46:11] can't get away from it
[46:14] you can't run from it you can't hide
[46:16] from it
[46:18] it's on the walls
[46:22] it's tucked up to the walls
[46:24] i will restore
[46:26] saith the lord
[46:28] i say god give us more houses like that
[46:33] that was april
[46:35] and may
[46:38] we came in june
[46:42] this is june the 11th
[46:44] 2021 on the first friday night brother
[46:47] john didn't know none about these signs
[46:49] didn't know anything about this
[46:50] inspiration didn't know nothing about
[46:53] this being written on bedpost and
[46:55] windows and refrigerators had no clue
[46:59] and the very first service we stood up
[47:01] on the friday night under the
[47:02] inspiration of the holy spirit i
[47:05] will restore saith the lord
[47:09] restored youth it was like a promise
[47:11] that's when i heard brother matthew give
[47:13] the testimony that that very scripture
[47:16] all the way back from february all the
[47:18] way april may now a visiting minister
[47:20] comes through
[47:22] in invisible
[47:24] tabernacle and the very first
[47:25] inspiration is joel chapter 2 25 i will
[47:29] restore to you the years that the
[47:32] locusts have eaten the cankerworm and
[47:33] the caterpillar and the palmer my great
[47:36] army which i sin among you i can say
[47:38] praise god there's a mind of the lord
[47:41] [Music]
[47:41] [Applause]
[47:51] and just toward the end of the service i
[47:52] want to give another testimony about
[47:54] something that was happening within
[47:56] hours of the service this was a friday
[47:58] night
[47:59] and already in europe it was already
[48:01] saturday but in the saturday afternoon
[48:03] there was a whole new incredible thing
[48:05] that happened on june the 12th and i
[48:07] want to close with that inspiration to
[48:09] let you know god's working globally the
[48:12] very hours
[48:16] it's not just here in south carolina
[48:18] this weekend it is happening globally
[48:22] brother john can say as a minister in
[48:23] the last six months that we have
[48:25] traveled full-time evangelism around the
[48:28] united states and been at youth meetings
[48:31] and local churches and then into europe
[48:33] just a few weeks ago the same
[48:35] inspiration and the same revival and the
[48:38] same spirit of god that is collecting
[48:41] our children and our young people is in
[48:43] this building
[48:46] tonight the same atmosphere
[48:51] the same pulsation and desire of you
[48:54] reaching out and thirsting and hungry
[48:56] and you don't even know why
[48:59] it's the holy ghost
[49:01] restoring so what was that
[49:04] it caused this inspiration what was it
[49:07] that would cause a burden
[49:10] of a mother
[49:12] a microwave
[49:15] on windows
[49:17] on mirrors
[49:20] on the refrigerator
[49:24] near the door
[49:27] it's like the token it's like
[49:29] it's like brother john i can't get away
[49:31] from this there's blood
[49:34] all over the door
[49:37] you know friends this message is not a
[49:39] bunch of quotes and volumes and sermons
[49:42] this message is christ
[49:45] and i wonder sometimes if we're really
[49:47] getting our young people to christ
[49:53] my wife is a very wonderful believer
[49:56] she's very burdened i'm very happy
[49:58] to have her this weekend she doesn't
[50:00] travel with brother john very much
[50:03] but she wanted to come sister rachel
[50:07] she wanted to come in june and she
[50:08] wanted to be here this weekend
[50:12] and last night it was almost midnight
[50:14] we're laying in the bed and she's just
[50:15] burning for the young ladies
[50:20] we just sat back there and saw everyone
[50:22] coming in
[50:24] and young lady i'll begin the week i'll
[50:26] be honest with you i was sitting
[50:28] right there on the aisle
[50:30] and i just began to weep
[50:32] as you came in
[50:34] as brothers begin to find their places
[50:36] and i
[50:40] just saw how you
[50:42] were coming into the presence of god
[50:44] brother john just began to weep
[50:46] my wife at midnight just saying honey
[50:49] when i saw the young ladies today she
[50:52] where the mic took us back to our room
[50:54] after the morning service and
[50:56] sister sharon wanted to stay she wanted
[50:58] to be with you she wanted to be at the
[51:00] volleyball court at the
[51:02] soccer court she wanted to eat lunch she
[51:04] wanted to be around the young people she
[51:05] went on the great big swing brother
[51:08] and face god
[51:12] she can't hardly sleep last night her
[51:14] arms are all achy they're all achy she
[51:16] says what it is finally this morning
[51:18] brother burley on the way to the service
[51:20] she said you know what i think it is
[51:21] it's because i was worshiping so much
[51:23] last night
[51:27] i was praising god
[51:29] i tell you we need more meetings like
[51:31] that
[51:33] hallelujah
[51:35] you all know how the welsh revival
[51:36] started in wales
[51:40] in the early 1900s there was a bunch of
[51:42] young people it wasn't that a an
[51:44] ordinary service it wasn't a regular
[51:46] service it was young people that saw the
[51:49] deadness in the church and they started
[51:50] to gather and have prayer meetings and
[51:52] gather and wanted to see a revival there
[51:54] were poor they were poor there were
[51:57] young men that worked in the coal mines
[51:59] and
[52:00] young people that were in churches that
[52:01] were dead brother jason
[52:04] and they were teenagers that said we've
[52:06] got to have a revival we we want to see
[52:08] a stir of god
[52:11] and in one of those services there was a
[52:13] young lady that was 17 18 years old i
[52:16] know when they dim the lights it makes
[52:18] everybody tired but just stay with us
[52:19] are y'all doing okay don't fall asleep
[52:21] on us amen yeah just shake your head
[52:24] amen thank you brother
[52:29] it was a 17 or 18 year old young lady
[52:32] she stood up in one of those meetings
[52:34] and just raised her hands and said lord
[52:37] jesus
[52:38] i love you with all of my heart
[52:41] and the holy ghost fell in that meeting
[52:43] and from that revival from that service
[52:47] streaked a whole welsh revival that
[52:49] brought over a hundred thousand souls to
[52:52] christ in wales because a young lady and
[52:55] young people said we must have a revival
[53:10] young people brother john's 49 years old
[53:12] i feel like i'm over the hill
[53:14] i said to my wife i think yesterday the
[53:16] day before we were having
[53:18] uh reading scripture and praying for
[53:20] these meetings together and i said honey
[53:22] we're about over the heel we're middle
[53:24] aged at least
[53:26] i admit that
[53:29] what are y'all laughing for
[53:31] when i was your age you looked to people
[53:33] to say he's old he's old he's 49 he's
[53:36] old he's almost 50 he's out putting out
[53:38] the pastor somewhere
[53:40] the thing about it is i know that it's
[53:41] true
[53:44] some of my better years are behind as it
[53:46] was
[53:48] and you young people the baton is in
[53:50] your hands now
[53:52] that's why i'm not preaching at you i'm
[53:54] preaching with you you're the church of
[53:56] today
[53:57] and i pray from these meetings and this
[53:59] weekend they would spawn pastors
[54:02] and ministers
[54:03] trustees and deacons and piano players
[54:06] and organ players and young men and
[54:08] young ladies that are on fire with god
[54:12] and i promise you for myself we're not
[54:14] going to try to stop you
[54:17] we're not going to be like david's old
[54:19] older brothers that were saying you
[54:20] naughty boy you naughty boy what are you
[54:22] doing delivering these cheeses and these
[54:24] breads get you back and get you back no
[54:27] they should have been the ones defeating
[54:29] the enemy
[54:31] i i pray god raised up more david's
[54:33] among us
[54:36] that in spite of the souls of the older
[54:38] people that you rise up in the humility
[54:41] of the anointing of god and take off the
[54:44] head of that goliath
[54:55] there shouldn't be one person
[54:57] discourage
[54:59] a young person from serving the lord
[55:03] there shouldn't be one elder in this
[55:05] message speak negatively
[55:08] about a young person that's trying to
[55:10] serve the lord
[55:12] we're here to pick you up this weekend
[55:17] do something for god
[55:19] do all you can for god
[55:21] don't wait until the candles have lit
[55:24] when god lights your flame you move
[55:26] under that inspiration
[55:29] and have a walk with god where you don't
[55:31] need the roar of the crowd and the
[55:33] thousands cheering you on
[55:36] but you can stand alone
[55:49] this past week i was reminded
[55:52] by another person that
[55:54] is also a minister but they came out of
[55:56] denominations they came out of the world
[55:58] they came out of and they spoke about
[56:01] the pressures and the rejection of what
[56:04] they had to go through in their fathers
[56:06] their mothers and in the churches they
[56:08] attended
[56:09] and they talked about how people wrote
[56:11] them off and
[56:13] said
[56:13] wrong things about them that was from
[56:16] denominations into the message
[56:19] but as the years go by we've seen the
[56:21] same decline
[56:24] and i pray god take that spirit out of
[56:26] all of us tonight but we would never
[56:28] speak negatively or speak against
[56:30] another believer
[56:32] but we would always encourage and always
[56:34] be one that would say what can we do for
[56:37] the lord
[56:39] that is the spirit of the holy ghost
[56:42] that was the spirit on the prophet that
[56:44] i hear every day i hear brother branham
[56:46] every day and even throughout the night
[56:48] my wife will tell you this that was the
[56:50] spirit of our prophet
[56:52] he would always encourage he was always
[56:54] what more can we do
[56:57] what was it in the mother
[56:59] that wrote this on her window
[57:04] why would she write and put a hole in
[57:06] her wall
[57:08] with a photo or with a picture of i will
[57:10] restore what was that
[57:16] then just a few weeks ago now i'm
[57:18] speaking tonight on restoration
[57:20] continuing this is in belgium
[57:25] we're young people just it was a small
[57:26] group from holland and
[57:29] almost all dutch-speaking young people
[57:32] i'm gonna go now into the next part of
[57:34] the service
[57:38] we had special meetings and then
[57:41] this is the saturday morning
[57:44] session
[57:45] are we doing okay
[57:48] it wasn't a service it was a time for
[57:50] the young people to speak and the pastor
[57:52] had felt led to
[57:54] speak about the covet 19
[57:56] virus and their response the young
[57:58] people how they had gone through these
[58:01] last
[58:02] 18 19 months the whole session was
[58:05] them speaking
[58:06] to us and sharing from their heart what
[58:09] they had gone through
[58:12] you know the first question was about
[58:14] the virus how this pandemic
[58:17] what they felt and the very first
[58:20] comment was we're sick of it
[58:23] who's been sick of it
[58:26] well the rest of you probably are sick i
[58:28] hope you're not sick with it
[58:31] we cast that demon far away from here
[58:36] tell you meetings like this have been
[58:37] criticized in the last several months
[58:40] burden pastors and churches have had
[58:42] meetings like this
[58:44] and then there'll be a wave of this
[58:46] crazy spirit try to take out assemblies
[58:49] that was the best place those young
[58:50] people could have been
[58:54] you put me in the presence of god any
[58:56] day
[58:57] i'll say it like david
[59:06] let's give david the microphone what do
[59:08] you think about it well a day in thy
[59:10] courts is better than a thousand with
[59:13] the wicked
[59:14] a thousand days is almost three years
[59:19] give me one day in the presence of god
[59:22] is better than three years
[59:25] with the wicked
[59:31] that was a young man that was anointed
[59:33] under the message of his day and he knew
[59:35] how to get away from javelins
[59:40] and he knew how to run and he knew where
[59:42] to go he was on his way to the throne he
[59:46] had already been prophesied over he had
[59:48] been born and raised and anointed by a
[59:50] prophet's message and nothing was going
[59:52] to stop him
[59:54] not a soul not his big brothers and not
[59:56] a goliath
[59:58] and not goliath's brothers
[1:00:02] it's time for us to raise up and know
[1:00:04] our position
[1:00:05] you're not little babies anymore
[1:00:09] young people
[1:00:10] a besting in tabernacle youth camp
[1:00:12] you're not a little baby anymore
[1:00:15] you're not a child
[1:00:19] you need to cut the apron strings with
[1:00:21] your mother and father just lean on that
[1:00:23] whatever they say whatever my pastor
[1:00:26] says it's not what do you believe
[1:00:38] and don't misunderstand i know those
[1:00:41] people that stream or will stream the
[1:00:43] service and they misunderstand and they
[1:00:45] twist and they misconstrue we're not
[1:00:47] even part of that we're of one mind and
[1:00:50] one accord lord send a restoration
[1:00:53] through the service
[1:00:54] lord may lives that are empty be filled
[1:01:00] may hearts that have been wounded be
[1:01:02] restored
[1:01:04] be lives that are empty
[1:01:06] be healed
[1:01:08] and hearts that are full let them just
[1:01:10] pour it out
[1:01:11] so that more of god can come in and
[1:01:13] maybe a little bit will just spill over
[1:01:15] the top
[1:01:17] in the book of acts people's shadows
[1:01:19] were healing the people
[1:01:22] they were having meetings where where
[1:01:24] the word was being spoken and lives are
[1:01:27] being filled with the holy ghost while
[1:01:28] they heard the word
[1:01:31] that was the type of service we had last
[1:01:33] night and that's the type of service
[1:01:35] that it ought to be more regular
[1:01:39] where we hear the word we receive the
[1:01:41] word and god infills us
[1:01:44] and for the rest of the service it's
[1:01:46] like a whole new dynamo happen it's like
[1:01:48] a ball of fire came down the pipe
[1:01:54] you all want me to go on should we play
[1:01:56] so we got around the tables
[1:01:59] with the young people the young men and
[1:02:01] the young ladies
[1:02:03] this is the pastor speaking
[1:02:07] to them speaking about their connection
[1:02:10] the young people begin to talk about how
[1:02:12] they couldn't go to church in the last
[1:02:14] 18 19 months that they couldn't be
[1:02:17] together
[1:02:18] i've got about five or six pages of
[1:02:21] notes of their comments i'm not going to
[1:02:22] read them all but i just wanted you to
[1:02:24] know what other young people have gone
[1:02:25] through the same
[1:02:27] last months that they've gone through
[1:02:30] many of you feel the same
[1:02:34] they begin to speak about how people
[1:02:36] become separated because of
[1:02:40] this virus and how all the rules and
[1:02:42] regulations brought instability and
[1:02:44] actually brought more fear
[1:02:47] to the people
[1:02:49] they talked about how people are afraid
[1:02:51] and the difficulties
[1:02:53] about their experiences with this whole
[1:02:55] thing
[1:02:56] young people in the message begin to
[1:02:58] express
[1:02:59] for the country
[1:03:01] their feelings of fear
[1:03:03] how they couldn't go on holiday trips
[1:03:05] and they were concerned that their
[1:03:07] grandparents would be afflicted
[1:03:10] no church services no
[1:03:12] youth meetings
[1:03:15] days were long there was no school
[1:03:17] because a lot of schools were shut down
[1:03:20] and family visits were cut off and the
[1:03:22] wearing of masks and the social
[1:03:25] distancing they caught social but it's
[1:03:27] anti-social really all the distancing
[1:03:34] you all are really quiet tonight
[1:03:37] that's how the world responds
[1:03:40] they want a distance
[1:03:42] they don't want to get further away
[1:03:44] that was exactly what satan wanted to
[1:03:46] have happen
[1:03:49] the distance
[1:03:51] they began to talk about their
[1:03:54] it just seemed like their life went on
[1:03:56] pause for a little while it was like
[1:03:58] they went on sleep mode nobody's ever
[1:04:01] heard of sleep mode like sleeping mode
[1:04:04] how they thought about things they they
[1:04:07] begin to ponder and meditate their
[1:04:09] social contacts
[1:04:11] they talked about conspiracy theories
[1:04:13] and in the politics and the scientists
[1:04:16] and people saying well follow the
[1:04:17] science and follow the politics it even
[1:04:20] crept into message pulpits
[1:04:24] people saying well if you have the holy
[1:04:26] ghost you wouldn't get the virus
[1:04:30] till it started to fit to them or
[1:04:32] someone in their church then they
[1:04:33] backtrack really fast
[1:04:35] let me tell you what that's nothing but
[1:04:36] a lie from the devil
[1:04:38] a holy ghost-filled person
[1:04:42] can get a disease
[1:04:44] can have cancer can have high blood
[1:04:47] pressure that is no indication tonight
[1:04:50] if satan is tempting you
[1:04:52] with spirits of of the world but you
[1:04:55] have you you are not a believer you are
[1:04:57] a son and you are a daughter of god and
[1:05:00] you need to shake yourself tonight
[1:05:04] to shake yourself
[1:05:07] [Music]
[1:05:12] we begin to speak about these things
[1:05:16] we talked about how they talked about
[1:05:19] streaming
[1:05:20] services versus live services and how
[1:05:25] they were taken from their live services
[1:05:27] and now being forced to stream
[1:05:31] and how they felt about that
[1:05:33] how did you all feel about that
[1:05:37] you didn't like it
[1:05:40] they talked about how
[1:05:42] being in a dedicated place of worship
[1:05:46] like a church or like meetings like this
[1:05:48] is so much more different than when
[1:05:50] you're just in your home
[1:05:55] yes we're believers at home yes we have
[1:05:57] the holy ghost yes we can raise our hand
[1:05:59] i'm not speaking about that this was
[1:06:00] young people
[1:06:02] expressing how different it was to be in
[1:06:04] live services
[1:06:06] where even when we're streaming at home
[1:06:09] there was distractions and it was more
[1:06:11] comfortable they talked about being
[1:06:13] falling asleep
[1:06:16] these are supposed to be services this
[1:06:18] anointed preaching and then people are
[1:06:20] left at home and you know then people go
[1:06:22] up to the room you say no it was just as
[1:06:25] good brother we feel closer to god now
[1:06:28] you know what friends if i was speaking
[1:06:30] to a age 40 and up group there's a lot
[1:06:33] of older ones that can maintain and
[1:06:35] maybe stream and last longer than young
[1:06:38] people can
[1:06:41] okay i'll say it amen brother john
[1:06:46] but for a family with children
[1:06:48] and young people
[1:06:52] it's not the same
[1:06:56] we need live services
[1:06:59] and yes for a season and yes for a time
[1:07:02] but there ought to be a desire to get
[1:07:03] right back into the church and
[1:07:06] get right back in the fellowship
[1:07:14] i'm speaking tonight on restoration
[1:07:17] continues if you have a local church to
[1:07:19] go to that are having services you ought
[1:07:22] to be there next sunday
[1:07:24] stop being somebody that just hangs out
[1:07:27] and using a virus for an excuse
[1:07:29] you're more safer in the presence of god
[1:07:42] young people talked about this and you
[1:07:44] know it's amazing how the same ones that
[1:07:46] were so against having live services and
[1:07:48] we need to be so careful we need to be
[1:07:50] careful you'd see them at walmart and
[1:07:52] costco and out there and they're dude
[1:07:54] they got a shop it's essential
[1:07:58] don't y'all understand we gotta fill our
[1:08:00] refrigerator
[1:08:02] we gotta have diapers we gotta have food
[1:08:08] the same ones that wouldn't come to
[1:08:10] church
[1:08:11] and wouldn't press through the unbelief
[1:08:13] and the fear
[1:08:14] that paul said gather yourself so much
[1:08:16] more as you see the day approaching
[1:08:19] they'll they'll be just happy pushing
[1:08:20] their little buggy and rubbing shoulders
[1:08:23] with someone they don't know that person
[1:08:24] from no i know brother jason but they
[1:08:26] don't know that check out person
[1:08:30] since when did walmart
[1:08:32] trump the presence of god
[1:08:38] don't meet the house of god and don't
[1:08:39] beat being in live services thank god
[1:08:42] that we can have meetings like this
[1:08:45] and if there's any person
[1:08:48] that it would even cross your mind
[1:08:51] that we have 400 people in a small
[1:08:53] little room all packed together
[1:08:56] and you're just saying well maybe
[1:08:59] colvin's going to strike them and i hope
[1:09:01] it does shame on you
[1:09:03] you're not even a believer
[1:09:05] you don't even have the holy ghost
[1:09:08] i didn't say if you think that i said if
[1:09:10] you continue to ponder like that and
[1:09:13] keep away you're not walking with the
[1:09:15] nature of the holy ghost
[1:09:17] as the manner of some are
[1:09:20] we ought to get right back in and say
[1:09:22] lord bring us back together again
[1:09:26] [Applause]
[1:09:35] they talked about how testing
[1:09:37] testing for the virus brought stress to
[1:09:39] them and i know what that's like who
[1:09:41] else knows what it's like to have a
[1:09:43] little cough have a fever do i have it
[1:09:44] do i have it or about a third of you who
[1:09:47] knows what i'm talking about and you got
[1:09:49] to get tested you got to get tested you
[1:09:50] got to quarantine you got to be away and
[1:09:52] satan will come right in and bring fear
[1:09:55] you're going to die you're going to do
[1:09:57] this
[1:10:01] brother jason demars can you stand to
[1:10:03] your feet
[1:10:04] this is a man
[1:10:06] that was in icu just a few days ago
[1:10:09] but restoration continued
[1:10:17] hallelujah
[1:10:19] let's stand and give god a standing
[1:10:21] ovation
[1:10:23] restoration
[1:10:25] continue
[1:10:28] hallelujah
[1:10:48] you may be seated and i don't want to
[1:10:49] embarrass anyone and brother john's a
[1:10:51] minister i understand
[1:10:53] there's privileges and health privileges
[1:10:56] and you talk to a doctor you don't tell
[1:10:58] things you talk to a nurse you talk to a
[1:11:00] minister it should be private but i
[1:11:02] wonder who in this building would be at
[1:11:04] least unashamed to say i also had that
[1:11:07] covet spirit but i'm here to stand in
[1:11:09] the presence of god and say
[1:11:11] satan couldn't take me i'm here and i'm
[1:11:14] going to serve god would you stand to
[1:11:16] your feet
[1:11:17] somebody that had covered
[1:11:20] but god healed you
[1:11:23] i'm standing
[1:11:31] just look around the room
[1:11:33] well you're not standing you're not
[1:11:34] standing
[1:11:36] nope
[1:11:38] i'm standing i had cloven in february of
[1:11:40] 2020.
[1:11:42] the god rich and mercy knew we needed to
[1:11:44] be standing here tonight
[1:11:46] and there's some that have gone on
[1:11:48] to their rewards but kova didn't take
[1:11:51] them
[1:11:53] i said coven didn't take them
[1:11:57] i'm sure there's somebody who already
[1:11:58] logged off of youtube a long time ago
[1:12:00] covet never took one believer
[1:12:04] god allowed them to go
[1:12:06] it was their time to go and whatever
[1:12:08] would take a believer is just lit it's
[1:12:11] just like hitching up a cart and taking
[1:12:13] you into that other dimension
[1:12:17] now friends the reason we're having
[1:12:18] services tonight is so that if you're
[1:12:21] not ready to go
[1:12:23] god would be able to give you that
[1:12:25] experience you can say i'm ready to go
[1:12:28] god bless you all that stood and those
[1:12:31] that didn't stand god
[1:12:33] thank you for healing you and delivering
[1:12:34] you he's our healer restoration
[1:12:40] healing is in the house
[1:12:43] and i'm not telling a story
[1:12:47] it's real we're alive we're we're
[1:12:49] restoration
[1:12:51] is what god's mind was about you what
[1:12:54] his thoughts are about you you're living
[1:12:56] you're breathing tonight to give god
[1:12:59] glory
[1:13:11] i'm just continuing about our notes
[1:13:13] about the young people in europe and
[1:13:16] at least three or four times for the
[1:13:18] burley they talked about loneliness
[1:13:21] and it was a lot of the sisters actually
[1:13:24] young ladies talked about throughout the
[1:13:26] last year and a half
[1:13:27] how the loneliness and the distancing
[1:13:30] and being in your room and having to do
[1:13:33] zoom or
[1:13:34] teams or you know you couldn't go to
[1:13:36] school hardly you couldn't
[1:13:38] now you're in your room now you're at
[1:13:40] your computer and just the loneliness
[1:13:46] i'm all alone i'm i'm in this room alone
[1:13:51] young people with the holy ghost
[1:13:54] shared about how
[1:13:56] loneliness
[1:13:58] they felt alone
[1:14:04] that's when that inspiration of the holy
[1:14:06] spirit comes upon
[1:14:08] you are not alone
[1:14:13] you are not alone
[1:14:17] i'm there with you
[1:14:21] i will go
[1:14:22] before you
[1:14:25] you are not alone
[1:14:29] you are not alone
[1:14:33] i am there
[1:14:35] with you
[1:14:37] i've already gone before you
[1:14:44] i am not alone
[1:14:48] i am not alone
[1:14:52] he is there before me
[1:14:56] he is there inside me
[1:15:01] not a song
[1:15:03] but now it's personal
[1:15:08] but i am alone by the john
[1:15:13] don't you see me in my room don't you
[1:15:15] see me in my
[1:15:16] i have to do school
[1:15:20] the young peoples are canceled the
[1:15:22] church is cancelled
[1:15:24] i am alone
[1:15:29] then the holy spirit begins to breathe
[1:15:33] you are not alone
[1:15:37] you are not alone
[1:15:44] young people begin to speak about this
[1:15:46] and the anxious
[1:15:47] moments and the
[1:15:49] their emotion
[1:15:51] how it just seemed like this was not
[1:15:53] going to end and then it started with a
[1:15:55] wave
[1:15:57] and it was going to get better and then
[1:15:59] another wave it's like lord
[1:16:04] and it caused anxiousness
[1:16:08] and it caused fear upon good young
[1:16:10] people
[1:16:12] believers of the message they struggled
[1:16:15] with feeling anxious and nervous
[1:16:22] and the holy spirit is just
[1:16:24] pulsating there
[1:16:26] saying breathe
[1:16:28] breathe
[1:16:31] breathe
[1:16:36] it's like
[1:16:37] being born coming through after nine
[1:16:40] months through
[1:16:42] and we'll get into this tomorrow night
[1:16:44] it was birthing you pain and suffering
[1:16:51] here you came out and it's like
[1:16:54] breathe

[1:17:01] if you don't breathe you're going to die
[1:17:05] if you're going to stay there you're
[1:17:06] going to die breathe
[1:17:09] tonight i'm encouraging you in this
[1:17:12] friday night service
[1:17:14] breed young people
[1:17:17] breathe
[1:17:22] just stop for a moment i want every
[1:17:24] person
[1:17:25] to just breathe
[1:17:28] take a breath
[1:17:33] now you know exactly you that stood
[1:17:34] earlier and you that have studied this
[1:17:36] you that are in medical know this is one
[1:17:38] of the main
[1:17:40] things about covet is take it tries to
[1:17:43] take your breath away
[1:17:46] and it'll cause your heart to just start
[1:17:48] and it'll start filling with your lungs
[1:17:50] where you cannot breathe what you from a
[1:17:52] little girl from a little boy was so
[1:17:55] natural just breathe now becomes forced
[1:17:59] now becomes now brother john waking up
[1:18:02] in the middle of the night sweaty and
[1:18:04] sweaty and i'm having to prop myself up
[1:18:06] with pillows it's like breathe breathe
[1:18:09] it's like this demon is trying to take
[1:18:11] my life and i remember countless times
[1:18:13] going into
[1:18:15] our hallway
[1:18:17] into the bathroom standing in front of
[1:18:18] the mirror saying satan you cannot take
[1:18:21] my life
[1:18:23] i defy you
[1:18:36] some of us just need to be encouraging
[1:18:37] one another breathe
[1:18:41] breathe young ladies
[1:18:43] young men breathe
[1:18:45] soak in this atmosphere what you feel
[1:18:48] right now if you went downtown atlanta
[1:18:51] downtown l.a tonight or downtown
[1:18:54] new york uh i just heard it the other
[1:18:56] day of someone and they saw a young lady
[1:18:59] that was just going down the street just
[1:19:02] throwing up and she's just a beautiful
[1:19:04] but she had just been marred and she's
[1:19:06] just throwing up
[1:19:10] drunk and maybe stoned out of her mind
[1:19:12] satan just taking a virtuous life and
[1:19:15] lotting it up like a piece of paper and
[1:19:17] throwing it into the corner
[1:19:21] just to hang as a trophy on some
[1:19:25] beast
[1:19:26] bill oh i got another one i got another
[1:19:28] one
[1:19:29] and satan tried to destroy you
[1:19:33] like you did peter
[1:19:35] tried to sift him like wheat
[1:19:38] and he cursed and he swore and he said i
[1:19:40] don't even know the man well the way
[1:19:42] you're talking and the way you all been
[1:19:44] singing this weekend i think your
[1:19:45] message believer and peter is so upset
[1:19:48] he just cursed and he swore
[1:19:51] are y'all listening
[1:19:54] let's just fast forward
[1:19:56] 53 days okay that's thursday night
[1:20:00] friday morning he's cursing and swearing
[1:20:03] in front of a young lady
[1:20:06] one of the few times a maid and a young
[1:20:09] lady is mentioned in the bible was peter
[1:20:11] cursed and he swore
[1:20:15] thursday night and friday morning jesus
[1:20:17] died on the cross on friday and he arose
[1:20:19] on sunday
[1:20:22] i look into the faces of some of you
[1:20:24] tonight
[1:20:25] and maybe you're struggling
[1:20:30] i know a lot of your parents and a lot
[1:20:32] of your pastors and i love them dearly
[1:20:38] but sometimes we can have young ladies
[1:20:40] right around us
[1:20:44] and they're beautiful and they're lovely
[1:20:48] but they don't know the lord
[1:20:52] we can have young men that are handsome
[1:20:54] and young men that can be talking to
[1:20:57] talk and
[1:20:58] have a grandpa have a grand grandma or
[1:21:01] have a
[1:21:02] a mother or father that's a lovely
[1:21:04] believer
[1:21:06] and they can talk to you and be so
[1:21:09] wonderful
[1:21:11] but you can
[1:21:12] sense
[1:21:14] there's an emptiness there somewhere
[1:21:19] it's not the way it ought to be
[1:21:23] that's what we're groaning for tonight
[1:21:25] brother jason
[1:21:28] that's why we dedicated tonight's
[1:21:30] service to bethel tabernacle because
[1:21:32] from a womb
[1:21:33] and from a desire
[1:21:35] and from a hunger
[1:21:37] of this church
[1:21:39] came the sermon tonight
[1:21:44] god is still restoring
[1:21:47] god is still continuing
[1:21:49] god is going to save your children
[1:21:52] god is going to save your grandchildren
[1:21:54] god is going to save your friend your
[1:21:56] brother your sister someone in your
[1:21:58] cabin
[1:21:59] this weekend god is going to meet them
[1:22:13] can i continue on just a little bit
[1:22:15] these young people begin to
[1:22:17] express about
[1:22:19] what it did positively
[1:22:21] the last 18 months going on 19 months
[1:22:24] how the it caused them to appreciate the
[1:22:26] times with one another
[1:22:29] and to realize
[1:22:32] what it means to miss people
[1:22:39] it's like
[1:22:40] we couldn't be together
[1:22:42] a few months ago a few weeks ago this
[1:22:44] wasn't even possible
[1:22:48] it was against the rules it was against
[1:22:50] the regulations and these young people
[1:22:52] begin to speak about how they learn to
[1:22:54] appreciate the little things
[1:22:58] that have been taken away but now once
[1:23:00] god begins to restore and bring them
[1:23:03] back they begin to respect one another
[1:23:06] when satan wanted to bring a division
[1:23:10] they begin to be thankful it's like one
[1:23:12] said they took three steps back and they
[1:23:14] began to look at things and they became
[1:23:16] more grateful
[1:23:18] how they could give more time to one
[1:23:19] another and learn to deal with criticism
[1:23:22] and opinions of someone else that was
[1:23:24] different they was able to think deeply
[1:23:27] and be grateful for their health
[1:23:30] let me just pause in this service are we
[1:23:32] all doing okay you say you're not
[1:23:34] reading a lot of quotes you're not
[1:23:36] but friends i'm i'm right down here with
[1:23:38] you
[1:23:43] jesus is talking to you
[1:23:52] they begin to speak about how they were
[1:23:54] grateful for their health this is what
[1:23:55] uh i want every person to look around
[1:23:58] the room does anybody see any
[1:23:59] wheelchairs
[1:24:00] here any crutches
[1:24:06] anybody see anybody in a natural
[1:24:08] straight jacket
[1:24:10] come on i'm asking you all
[1:24:13] do you all see that i think we ought to
[1:24:16] thank god for our health
[1:24:30] say what am i supposed to do when i lose
[1:24:32] my health
[1:24:33] you praise him in the storm
[1:24:37] what do i do when i am all alone and i'm
[1:24:39] not with the crowd you praise him in the
[1:24:42] storm say what do i do when it seems
[1:24:45] like everything's falling everything's
[1:24:47] going negative everybody's against me
[1:24:49] you praising in the storm
[1:24:52] [Applause]
[1:25:03] i will praise you in this storm
[1:25:08] i will lift my hands
[1:25:12] cause you are who you are
[1:25:15] no matter where i get
[1:25:20] every tear i cry
[1:25:23] you hold in your hand
[1:25:26] you've never left my side
[1:25:31] hallelujah
[1:25:33] come on what's the next line
[1:25:37] though my heart is torn
[1:25:41] [Music]
[1:25:43] i'll praise you in my story
[1:25:47] hallelujah
[1:26:00] we begin to speak about this with just a
[1:26:03] little group brother
[1:26:04] jason it probably just would have been
[1:26:06] this little group over here maybe 50 70.
[1:26:10] it wasn't even a fraction of
[1:26:12] even those that are streaming tonight
[1:26:16] it's just a small little group but it
[1:26:18] gave brother john a little window
[1:26:20] to see that young people all over the
[1:26:22] globe
[1:26:24] another thing they mention is they begin
[1:26:26] to appreciate the smiles on people's
[1:26:28] faces with no more masks
[1:26:32] they discovered the smile of people
[1:26:37] i'm not against masks i'm not against
[1:26:39] that
[1:26:40] but when you take off the mask you can
[1:26:42] see the face
[1:26:44] and i think it should be 100 percent we
[1:26:46] love to see someone smile
[1:26:51] is that true i think i got about half of
[1:26:53] you with me
[1:26:57] they make you do it when you go through
[1:26:58] security it's like you got to pull down
[1:26:59] your mouth they want to see your face
[1:27:02] it's like i want to see the best part of
[1:27:04] you you don't start taking off your
[1:27:05] socks and show them your
[1:27:10] they want to see your face
[1:27:13] is that right
[1:27:14] god wants to see your face
[1:27:17] he wants to see you love him and enjoy
[1:27:19] him
[1:27:20] sometimes even in the house of god we
[1:27:22] get to a place where we become satisfied
[1:27:24] with a boring
[1:27:26] relationship with jesus
[1:27:29] and our atmosphere even in our meetings
[1:27:31] and our church in our homes can get so
[1:27:33] reckless with fighting
[1:27:37] and seeing the negative
[1:27:40] and talking about why we're heard and
[1:27:42] where we went wrong
[1:27:45] and somebody done somebody wrong song
[1:27:47] and it begins to be our theme
[1:27:49] and we need to change that tune
[1:27:52] we need to let the holy spirit come
[1:27:54] bursting through our lives young people
[1:27:57] early will i seek this early in my youth
[1:28:01] early in my life
[1:28:03] early in the morning early
[1:28:07] amen
[1:28:08] in the morning when i rise
[1:28:12] give
[1:28:13] me
[1:28:16] amen
[1:28:26] but let me let me just tell you i'm
[1:28:28] getting into your private life in a
[1:28:29] moment what most of you
[1:28:32] the first thing you look at is a little
[1:28:34] device
[1:28:36] you're so interested you just want to
[1:28:38] know you gotta somebody might have
[1:28:40] texted me or emailed me i gotta check my
[1:28:42] instagram or my facebook i got it what
[1:28:44] happened during the night he won that
[1:28:46] game or what do we got to do and we're
[1:28:48] just so focused on that's the first
[1:28:50] thing in the morning
[1:28:51] i wonder tonight if we can just say lord
[1:28:54] jesus i want to sanctify consecrate my
[1:28:56] life to you even the devices that you
[1:28:59] have i want to seek your face first

[1:29:08] i'm not preaching a sermon tonight i'm
[1:29:10] living
[1:29:11] in front of you a life
[1:29:18] and they begin to speak about this
[1:29:21] and talk about this
[1:29:24] now
[1:29:30] at the end of this session on on
[1:29:32] saturday morning
[1:29:34] the pastor felt led to turn to a certain
[1:29:36] scripture
[1:29:37] to just close it all out and this was we
[1:29:39] had friday night service
[1:29:41] this was saturday morning we had
[1:29:42] saturday night sunday morning this is
[1:29:45] saturday morning and he felt to read a
[1:29:47] scripture does anybody even want to
[1:29:48] guess what scripture it was
[1:29:53] joel
[1:29:54] chapter 2.
[1:29:57] and he read the scripture about i will
[1:29:59] restore
[1:30:01] and how in verse 28 joel 2 28 and 29
[1:30:04] where it says afterward
[1:30:07] i will pour out my spirit
[1:30:10] can you just stay with me a little bit
[1:30:11] longer
[1:30:14] after the cancer worm after the palm or
[1:30:17] after the locust has come in now and
[1:30:20] tried to destroy you afterward i will
[1:30:23] pour out my spirit
[1:30:26] it's god saying i'm going to take away
[1:30:28] the shame from my people you will never
[1:30:32] be ashamed he says it twice you will
[1:30:34] never be ashamed after all of these
[1:30:37] years after all of these months of what
[1:30:40] satan has tried to distract you it was
[1:30:42] on the news it was on the
[1:30:45] papers it was on websites it was in your
[1:30:47] schools it was in your jobs it even
[1:30:49] affected message churches
[1:30:53] this virus i'm talking about i'm closing
[1:30:55] out on this virus praise the lord
[1:30:59] but i'm talking about
[1:31:00] restoration god looks beyond all of
[1:31:03] those things and at the end he says
[1:31:05] afterwards
[1:31:08] afterwards
[1:31:10] i will re i i will
[1:31:12] pour out my spirit
[1:31:14] it's like god is going to watch you and
[1:31:16] test you and see throughout this time
[1:31:19] and then afterwards i will pour out my
[1:31:22] spirit
[1:31:23] i say lord fulfill that scripture
[1:31:27] it was like the lord was wanting to
[1:31:28] break the chains of the enemy on the
[1:31:31] minds on the bodies and on the souls of
[1:31:34] his children
[1:31:36] and after all of these months after all
[1:31:38] of these years god was saying i
[1:31:41] will restore saith the lord
[1:31:45] [Applause]
[1:31:55] how many think that's wonderful from
[1:31:57] february early year april
[1:32:02] may
[1:32:04] june
[1:32:04] [Music]
[1:32:06] come a sister that wrote these notes all
[1:32:08] over her house please stand to her feet
[1:32:26] then it's not sister rachel alone
[1:32:29] it was a burden it was like birth pains
[1:32:31] it was like the groaning that
[1:32:34] the sisters are a reflection of the
[1:32:37] church the condition of a church
[1:32:40] is where the ladies are at
[1:32:44] it's where the young people are at i
[1:32:45] don't need to know what all of you
[1:32:47] believe but this weekend just looking
[1:32:50] into your faces brother branham said you
[1:32:52] can talk to a person for two minutes and
[1:32:55] tell whether they have the holy ghost or
[1:32:57] not
[1:32:59] and he said and you can too that's a
[1:33:01] direct quote
[1:33:03] he said i can talk to a person for two
[1:33:06] minutes and tell whether they have the
[1:33:08] holy ghost or not and you can too
[1:33:12] so we carry an atmosphere
[1:33:15] what we speak about what we talk about
[1:33:17] how we live our lives you say well
[1:33:19] brother john it looks like i'm just all
[1:33:21] eight away just my attitude the
[1:33:24] rebellion
[1:33:26] and god is saying it's like he
[1:33:28] overlooked all of that all the years and
[1:33:31] all the months and he's saying i'm
[1:33:33] looking beyond all of that and i'm
[1:33:35] saying i will restore saith the lord
[1:33:39] my goodness is gonna come after you
[1:33:42] regardless of how you feel where you're
[1:33:45] at i'm gonna find you i'm gonna come
[1:33:48] after you and i will restore you back
[1:34:04] let me just make this clear all of you
[1:34:05] that are in the back the helpers the
[1:34:07] parents and many older ones pastors and
[1:34:09] ministers
[1:34:10] we all
[1:34:12] had it difficult
[1:34:14] in the last year and a half
[1:34:17] since march 2020
[1:34:21] till october now it's november on monday
[1:34:24] we've all had it let's get out of our
[1:34:25] pity parties
[1:34:27] stop living like a victim
[1:34:31] stop holding the victim card and not
[1:34:33] being an overcomer and saying it's well
[1:34:35] because it's this or it's that or i'm
[1:34:37] the only young person in my church or
[1:34:40] i'm the only one that is wanting to
[1:34:42] serve god in my family or i'm the only
[1:34:44] young person that's strong or this or
[1:34:47] that that's called a victim
[1:34:49] and you need to stop waving that before
[1:34:51] the lord tonight you need to wave your
[1:34:54] heart before the lord of praise and of
[1:34:57] worship
[1:35:00] may not give you my life i give you my
[1:35:02] praise
[1:35:17] and tomorrow night we're going to speak
[1:35:18] more along this line but right at the
[1:35:21] end of all of this
[1:35:23] god gives you a feast
[1:35:26] october to the jews
[1:35:29] is the month of the feast of tabernacles
[1:35:31] i'm going to speak on that tomorrow
[1:35:33] night
[1:35:34] i'm going to feast of speak about
[1:35:37] spiritual contractions
[1:35:39] in your booth a booth
[1:35:41] was what they were called to make
[1:35:44] before the feast of the tabernacles
[1:35:46] which was private it was small it was
[1:35:48] crude it was temporary but they were
[1:35:51] called to go into their individual booth
[1:35:54] it was it speaks of consecration it
[1:35:57] speaks of dedication we're going to read
[1:35:59] out leviticus and nehemiah when ezra
[1:36:02] stood up to read this in the book of
[1:36:04] nehemiah about we are to have booths
[1:36:08] the bible says they had not practiced
[1:36:10] that since the days of joshua
[1:36:13] which was 1 000 years
[1:36:18] the message had
[1:36:20] neglected personal
[1:36:22] consecration and dedication
[1:36:26] and they wanted a revival they wanted
[1:36:28] the feast
[1:36:29] but they had neglected the booth
[1:36:33] so tomorrow night i want to bring that
[1:36:35] out the spiritual contractions in your
[1:36:38] booth
[1:36:39] it's got to be personal it's got to be
[1:36:41] individual it's your consecration
[1:36:45] if you want to go on with god
[1:36:48] there has to be a start
[1:36:54] friends deliverance how many has ever
[1:36:57] seen someone delivered or been delivered
[1:36:59] it happens like it can happen in a
[1:37:01] moment
[1:37:02] do we believe in that it's like
[1:37:08] deliverance is like a miracle can be
[1:37:11] instant but restoration
[1:37:13] is a process
[1:37:16] that's what i'm speaking on tonight
[1:37:18] it takes time
[1:37:20] and i believe i think all of us believe
[1:37:23] in a spontaneous dynamic and feeling of
[1:37:26] the holy ghost
[1:37:28] every person that goes in the rapture
[1:37:30] the bride will receive a holy ghost
[1:37:33] revival
[1:37:34] do we believe that
[1:37:36] any any believer should embrace the
[1:37:39] power of the holy ghost if you're
[1:37:41] leaning toward being formal and
[1:37:43] indifferent
[1:37:48] well i'll let you finish it
[1:37:51] we need to run tonight to jesus christ i
[1:37:54] was thinking tonight about how precious
[1:37:56] it is that we can have meetings like
[1:37:58] this
[1:38:00] to be around people that actually love
[1:38:01] you that are cheering you on
[1:38:05] that someone's giving you the baton
[1:38:07] saying
[1:38:08] take it
[1:38:09] take it
[1:38:11] take it
[1:38:14] i'm not saying give me that microphone
[1:38:16] give me that bro who do you think you
[1:38:17] are take it
[1:38:20] run
[1:38:22] go
[1:38:26] what's the
[1:38:28] thus saith the lord to the bride
[1:38:32] so as we close tonight i wanted you to
[1:38:34] see that restoration takes time
[1:38:39] on these photos i'm going to show you
[1:38:41] this this doesn't take five minutes 10
[1:38:44] minutes
[1:38:44] 30 minutes
[1:38:46] it takes time
[1:38:49] a miracle is instant a deliverance can
[1:38:51] happen like that but when you get up
[1:38:53] from the altar when you go back to
[1:38:55] school that's when restoration has to
[1:38:57] continue
[1:39:03] look at this
[1:39:04] how many has ever seen restoration of a
[1:39:06] building before it doesn't happen in a
[1:39:08] week or a weekend
[1:39:10] see this is where the ministry's got to
[1:39:12] realize that it's not a momentary
[1:39:14] blessing it's not just the just the
[1:39:17] momentary blessing we're trying to get
[1:39:19] the young people to it's the eternal
[1:39:22] deposit that will last far beyond this
[1:39:25] week
[1:39:27] we're trying to get you to love him
[1:39:29] [Applause]
[1:39:38] everybody wants to you know go out on
[1:39:40] friday night
[1:39:41] take drugs drink it up have a good time
[1:39:44] go to a sex party yeah we had a great
[1:39:47] time that's that's what the world does
[1:39:51] god forbid we bring that into the
[1:39:52] message
[1:39:54] just try to bring in you know just
[1:39:55] momentary blessings and momentary
[1:39:57] impulses and everybody amen that down on
[1:40:00] monday down i'm speaking to you next
[1:40:02] thursday
[1:40:04] i'm talking to you about next friday
[1:40:06] night
[1:40:08] restoration continues
[1:40:11] and i pray it continues for every person
[1:40:15] but you would catch that revelation
[1:40:18] i need that experience i need but i also
[1:40:21] need to go on from there
[1:40:28] look at this i mean it takes more than a
[1:40:31] few days to put the scaffolding up for
[1:40:33] the cadre look at this
[1:40:34] they're trying to this uh put you know
[1:40:37] roof on around this old clock and this
[1:40:39] little just putting the scaffolding up
[1:40:41] takes days in place
[1:40:44] people aren't willing to do that in the
[1:40:45] message
[1:40:48] they want a momentary hit give me
[1:40:50] something fast that's what you did in
[1:40:52] the world
[1:40:53] that's what the parents did and the
[1:40:55] elders did in the world
[1:41:00] i pray that we lay something into our
[1:41:02] young people that long after these
[1:41:04] lights are off and long after we've all
[1:41:07] gone home sunday and monday there's been
[1:41:10] something left in your heart
[1:41:13] i will go on
[1:41:14] i will go on
[1:41:18] [Applause]
[1:41:27] press on
[1:41:42] i just feel like the angel of the lord
[1:41:44] is here right now
[1:41:48] as you have your seats what i'm speaking
[1:41:49] about is beyond emotion
[1:41:52] but it includes emotion
[1:41:56] i know you are being seated so i don't
[1:41:59] want someone to on the internet to have
[1:42:01] a little blip there like we did at the
[1:42:02] beginning of the service and say is it
[1:42:04] buffering us but everything's common
[1:42:06] everybody's doing fine here is everybody
[1:42:07] doing fine
[1:42:10] what i'm speaking about is beyond
[1:42:11] emotion but it includes emotion in fact
[1:42:14] i pray god give us a double portion
[1:42:17] god give us more young ladies that'll
[1:42:19] stand up and say lord i love you with
[1:42:21] all of my heart
[1:42:23] [Applause]
[1:42:34] let's just get something very clear
[1:42:36] because
[1:42:37] we have older ones here also
[1:42:39] older people don't have it all together
[1:42:41] either
[1:42:44] we hear sermons about god's will and
[1:42:46] god's purpose and you've got to find it
[1:42:47] you've got to know for certain and all
[1:42:49] these things there's a lot of older
[1:42:51] people that are still trying to find
[1:42:52] god's will for their life and what job
[1:42:55] and where we should go and should we
[1:42:56] move to this
[1:42:58] they're making decisions and they're
[1:42:59] groaning what should we do lord what
[1:43:01] should we do so are our young people
[1:43:08] so we need to remove the facade
[1:43:11] it's called hypocrisy
[1:43:13] that puts out this strong image i've got
[1:43:16] it all together
[1:43:19] no you don't have it all together
[1:43:21] even the older ones we we're just one
[1:43:23] breath away
[1:43:25] we're just one breath away just talk to
[1:43:28] our miracle here brother there's just
[1:43:29] one breath away from going into that
[1:43:31] other side
[1:43:35] you talk about torment
[1:43:37] and most of you heard the testimony
[1:43:40] you talk about the anxiety you talk
[1:43:41] about a man sitting right over here that
[1:43:43] has the holy ghost
[1:43:45] that was tormented
[1:43:48] didn't even know if he was going to live
[1:43:50] to see sister amy or his family
[1:43:53] so if an older person brother matthew do
[1:43:56] you ever groan to find the will of god
[1:43:57] for your life
[1:43:59] is that yes oh my yes
[1:44:03] i'm trying to work with you brother
[1:44:09] brother brother cadre i mean
[1:44:13] okay brother burnley
[1:44:17] he was quick he
[1:44:18] knew brother jason
[1:44:21] do you pray for god's will and
[1:44:25] then why do we look down on our young
[1:44:27] people why do we speak so condescending
[1:44:30] to them they're trying to find their way
[1:44:35] sometimes even our church services we
[1:44:37] can make one another so nervous and it's
[1:44:39] like we have to conform it's like we
[1:44:41] have to be spiritual it's like we have
[1:44:43] to uh
[1:44:45] i'm not
[1:44:46] i'm not saying that's bad but i'm just
[1:44:48] saying we can make one another feel like
[1:44:52] yeah yeah yeah and really it's like
[1:44:54] they're groaning
[1:44:59] if you read the book of judges right
[1:45:00] after joshua it says after joshua and
[1:45:03] caleb and the generation that was with
[1:45:05] them
[1:45:06] passed away there rose up another
[1:45:07] generation that did not know the lord
[1:45:10] we're living in that generation
[1:45:12] being around the message and saying
[1:45:14] brother branham was a prophet and having
[1:45:16] good this and that and having good music
[1:45:18] is wonderful
[1:45:20] my wife loves your music i love it too
[1:45:23] she said it going home in the car last
[1:45:25] night i think i love their loud music
[1:45:28] i loved your loud music
[1:45:30] play it louder brother aaron hey man
[1:45:33] sister deb
[1:45:36] we're not at a funeral
[1:45:38] and this is a youth camp by the way
[1:45:46] it's beyond intellect
[1:45:49] but i encourage every person here
[1:45:50] tonight
[1:45:52] to receive the holy ghost
[1:46:02] when you look at this time of disaster
[1:46:04] and i'm coming down to the end here
[1:46:06] tornadoes damage comes snow
[1:46:09] begins to bring damage to a situation to
[1:46:11] a family to a life
[1:46:13] flooding fire
[1:46:15] maybe a business or your personal world
[1:46:17] just gets turned upside down
[1:46:24] sometimes you just need to take a step
[1:46:26] back
[1:46:27] and recover
[1:46:33] lord restore us
[1:46:37] i'm just praying right now how to close
[1:46:39] the service
[1:46:42] but i pray that the lord brother yawns
[1:46:44] answers this prayer
[1:46:47] lord restore all of our young people
[1:46:51] restore their minds
[1:46:53] the name of jesus christ
[1:46:56] may every wondering spirit be brought
[1:46:58] back into the right to be placed
[1:47:01] i'm standing here as a minister of the
[1:47:03] gospel
[1:47:06] may every spirit of our young ladies
[1:47:08] that has somehow wandered out there into
[1:47:10] a world
[1:47:13] and you're thinking things and you're
[1:47:15] going places that's not even real
[1:47:18] it's time for you to come back tonight
[1:47:22] and in the name of jesus christ
[1:47:24] we're coming after you
[1:47:26] there's any of our young men that are
[1:47:28] totally it's almost like they've gone
[1:47:30] insane it's almost like you look into
[1:47:31] their face
[1:47:34] and their eyes are just
[1:47:37] it's wandering eyes it's searching eyes
[1:47:40] it's looking eyes
[1:47:43] and you know
[1:47:46] if the rapture was tonight or tomorrow
[1:47:48] they would not go you know you sensed
[1:47:50] that
[1:47:52] and i wonder sometimes
[1:47:54] where is the holy ghost conviction in
[1:47:56] our meetings anymore where's our burden
[1:47:59] for one another
[1:48:04] i dedicated the service to bethel
[1:48:05] tabernacle and i told my wife driving
[1:48:08] home last night about this church i said
[1:48:11] the main thing i appreciate about them
[1:48:13] is they are real
[1:48:16] maybe it was when we got into our motel
[1:48:18] room i said they're real
[1:48:23] what you see
[1:48:25] is what it is there's not a big facade
[1:48:27] there's there's not a bunch of people
[1:48:29] playing the instruments for
[1:48:31] for fame there's not people grabbing the
[1:48:32] microphone and just trying to be on the
[1:48:35] next
[1:48:36] youtube
[1:48:38] channel
[1:48:38] splice
[1:48:41] vessel tabernacle god has honored you
[1:48:45] and blessed you
[1:48:46] because of your desire
[1:48:51] and i thank you
[1:48:53] for inviting all of us into this
[1:48:54] atmosphere
[1:48:57] that we could be healed
[1:49:03] when i tried to find some photos of
[1:49:05] restoration you can look on the pictures
[1:49:08] here quickly i'll go through these this
[1:49:10] doesn't take five minutes it doesn't
[1:49:12] take 30 minutes it's not when you go
[1:49:13] back to your cabin and then no you gotta
[1:49:15] there's holy ghost effort there's
[1:49:18] i'm not calling it works i'm calling
[1:49:20] about the nature of the holy spirit in a
[1:49:23] person
[1:49:24] is willing to stick to it
[1:49:28] when the music fades
[1:49:30] i still love the lord
[1:49:33] when the preachers are gone and they're
[1:49:35] and the way that they preach
[1:49:38] and the anointing that's on them
[1:49:41] but brother john's got to get an
[1:49:42] airplane monday morning at six o'clock
[1:49:45] with my wife
[1:49:46] and we've got to go back to another life
[1:49:49] too
[1:49:50] and it's not always easy
[1:49:53] and you don't always have everybody in
[1:49:55] the stands cheering you on and saying
[1:49:57] god bless you and patting you on the
[1:49:59] back
[1:50:00] but you and i have got to know
[1:50:03] that god is with us
[1:50:05] and like moses said unless god go not up
[1:50:08] with us we don't want to go if your
[1:50:10] presence don't go we don't want to go
[1:50:13] i encourage you to pray about it
[1:50:16] get counsel about it
[1:50:20] and pray a little more
[1:50:22] and then wait a little more
[1:50:24] and make sure you're neutral
[1:50:28] but when god speaks and when god says
[1:50:31] now is the time
[1:50:32] don't be a coward
[1:50:39] next thursday
[1:50:41] at your work or at school someone just
[1:50:43] puts it out there

[1:51:31] building

[1:51:35] a vision
