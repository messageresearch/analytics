TRANSCRIPT
========================================
read in the scriptures it seems like something so great is the bible we should we should read many many verses lord but i think it suffices today i don't think we could ever read it too much and uh lord the bible says that there is a blessing in reading it and even a blessing and hearing it read so now we already know by the promise of your word that we are already receiving a blessing for reading and having it heard uh read to us so now master would you break it to us as you have laid it upon my heart and i pray for real clearness of mine today lord and and and and bravery i'm gonna need some real courage i want to make some statements lord and and so i'm i'm asking for your mercy and your help today lord these sick requests that have come in first we thank you for our little brother moses that is recovering we pray lord that the doctors will find out what's the problem or lord you'll just run that devil off so thoroughly it was never come back and problem solved so master we're asking for these other needs we're looking there into the saint john home expecting you to heal and recover those who are sick and to protect those lord who are there also and and father for this uh lengthy need that uh this person sent concerning their mother their family their own lives lord i lord you heard it you saw every word they're asking big so we're praying and believing big with them that they will receive everything for our little brother hunter that you will speed lord you multiply you're not you're not bound up with adding and subtracting you multiply so multiply the speed of his healing lord and may the bone and the fracture be recovered rapidly now help us one and all we commit it to you today in jesus name amen god bless you can be seated all right let's have my title slide please brothers now i have um a a mini many and i've whittled them down i got i went almost went into sticker shock brother mark was telling me we were talking the other day and and i remember i told you wednesday i said look we i had so many quotes and i started whittling them down and i noticed we started on slide 43 and uh so uh you know we bypassed 43 other slides and i said so now i've just got down to a few and brother mark said no i counted you got 46 more after that after 43 and i went oh i we can't have that so i i called them way way way way way down to a fraction of that but nonetheless i i only want to read them to you because first of all we believe that god sent a prophet in this day and we believe that it's a message of restoration that'll prepare a bride for a rapture so we should certainly be interested in what he had to say and i'm i i want to start very early and i want you to notice right off the bat now last time that we put up the powerpoint we took a subtitle uh of a rational look just a rational look at revelation 10. and we just build a rational case for why we believe it the way we do today we're taking a different subtitle god's promises to the last age the restoration of all things now how many believe we're in the last age well then the promises of the scripture are very clear that in the last day there was supposed to be a restoration of the full word where it had been lost down through the dark ages god would restore it all back and with that restoration comes many many promises of the divine working of almighty god the supernatural signs and wonders great miracles taking place and we are to see these things we are to see a token come back in we are to see that token put on display something not seen since the early church they had a dip of the holy ghost of course they did it takes the holy spirit to bring a new birth and they were certainly born again down through those ages and christ winking sitting in the eternities according to the book of revelation winking at a lot of their misunderstood ignorance of the word because you can't disbelieve what you don't know and since unbelief since sin is unbelief and you can't disbelieve what you don't know then they're not guilty of sin see they're guilty of misunderstanding and so christ would intercede for his family i'm here to tell you something friends the lord has it all figured out and he's got it all covered he's got all the bases covered he's thought of everything and so so we find that that it was to be restored back and a token was to be put on display a jubilee was to come back to the people because after all that's what pentecost is pentecost was the long-awaited jubilee that israel was promised they turned it down it went to the gentiles easy peasy right that's the history of the church and so all of those things under the jubilee under pentecost went to the to the first church and you know you can go through we say and i just want to weigh in right here and i made this comment wednesday and i wanted to clarify it to make sure you understand my position so there are several places in the book of acts because we always think of pentecost as just the book of acts but that's actually not accurate that's a that's a too narrow of a view and you'll end up in in an imbalance of understanding if you only see it that way and and if you and i'll say it this way so if you only see pentecost as the book of acts you're already short-sighted because pentecost was the jubilee the jubilee was the mighty god unveiled so the jubilee was everything that we now know what we refer to as the truth under the opening of the seven seals understand in paul's day it wasn't sealed it was the full jubilee they had the full mighty god unveiled they had the full brother adam said the abstract was returned now mankind could god could live inside mankind and christ could continue his ministry now in a mini-member church so they had the jubilee said why didn't they go in the rapture because the backslid and it went off down into the ages but god said at the seventh age i'll bring it all back i'll unseal it again i'll unseal it christ can't come for the bride in the first stage he must sit back down in the eternities in her seat for ignorance seal up the word under seven seals but at the end time he would break them and he would reveal it and we'd have the jubilee again we'd come back to pentecost again not the azusa not the azusa revival see now that's part of the restoration just because signification the gifts of the spirit but what what the azusa revival came became was denominational and they organized and that's the one that's the pentecost brother branham is referring to when he says you can't mix pentecost with this message he's certainly not talking about the jubilee he's certainly not talking about the the the the abstract title and the and the ministry of the son of man in the early church he's talking about what the azusa revival became under manmade corruption and you can't you can't mix that denominational system with this message but he's not meeting the original pentecost because that's what this message is it's not an addition to it it is it it is the restoration of it see that's all it is and so it's god keeping his word so now i i want you to to really pay close attention to that because when we think of pentecost you're now you already know enough to know i'm not talking about denomination and you're now you should know that i'm not merely talking about the azusa revival you should also now know that i'm talking about the original you should also now know that i'm not just talking about only the book of acts in the original everything that paul taught everything in the epistles written by the apostles the doctrine of the church is founded on the teaching of the of the apostles and prophets you're with me now i've told you i'm going slow i'm really trying hard i'm doing pretty good so so you find out that that that's why i made a statement to you that you know paul you know if you just look in the book of acts you do have places in the book of acts where it talks about great signs and great wonders there's three four five places in the book of acts where it talks about signs and wonders and the gifts of the spirit and we're all for it i'll take it times a thousand all right but but the book of acts also pentecost everybody says i want to go back to pentecost and all they're thinking of is we want to see the gifts operating in the power and demonstration but pentecost also includes the indictment peter's sermon the first thing that god preached after the holy ghost fell was an indictment brother branham calls acts 2 his indictment sermon see i mean you you got to go you got to move over into the house of cornelius you got to go over into acts 10. you got to go through acts 13 and you start seeing the the it's not just jews now gentiles and now now the mystery of god is becoming opened see i didn't understand that peter had to come back and give an explanation they're like what are you doing you know why why'd you give the holy ghost to gentile dogs and peter's like i gave him the whole are you kidding what could i do i was just standing there i saw a vision i was on a rooftop my net let down and said kill and eat and i said not so because i know gentiles are dogs but the lord said don't call unclean what i've called clean and then i had a vision there's men coming to your door go with them and doubt nothing here they came they knocked they wanted me here i go here we go then i'm there then i start preaching and while i'm preaching christ the holy ghost the same one that fell on us in the upper room fell on them and peter said what what could i do what'd you expect me to do about it he said i baptized every one of them in the name of the lord so because they received what we what we received see so now the establishment of and then and then from there i mean goodness you're gonna you're gonna go over to acts chapter 20. see acts chapter 20 divides the the anoint false anointed ones with a true anointing but paul said i fear after my departure go read acts 20. that grievous wolves and that's the very scripture brother branham used in anointed ones at the end time went back and tied it to that he goes he takes paul's teaching in the book of acts and ties it to the book of hebrews and he begins to separate law from grace that's pentecost you don't have pentecost if you've only if you're only chasing signs and wonders if you're only chasing power and demonstration you're missing the indictment you're you're missing the the separating law from grace you're missing out on election you're you're missing out on anointed ones at the end time see and then paul's got to even correct peter because he's disseminating between jews and gentiles and not acting right and paul catches him you know being sneaky and when he when he's when he's he he's sitting with the jews you know i mean he's sitting with the gentiles man he's eating all this unclean food that jews aren't supposed to eat and then a knock comes on the door who is it it's a bunch of gentiles oh my goodness put the stuff away and when he gets to wear underground you know when he get i mean the jews are at the door he's eating with gentiles and jews are at the door he jumps up cleans his plate quickly and paul says to him peter is that pork i smell on your breath and he and he busted him and paul said i confronted him to the face and corrected him and peter had to repent openly and got embarrassed and peter later on talks about paul's words are a tantamount to other scriptures so that's all so i made the point so then when paul starts when paul goes with the pentecostal experience teaching husbands how to love their wives and ministers under the restoration under the restored word start teaching their churches about ministers and marriage and how to raise children and how to have a family home and people say oh you're preaching psychology you're not preaching psychology you're preaching the seventh seal you're preaching the opening of the word see brother jd could give you a lesson he's not here today he could give you a lesson on on what jewish traditionalism had done to the role of women in the early and the days when jesus was on the earth and the apostles were there and that's why paul's got to correct it paul is saying look first of all abraham didn't treat sarah the way jews treat their wives now it's a whole middle eastern thing where the wives are basically just property and what had done that traditions of men and it wasn't just jews it was arabs it was everybody and women have become second-class citizens and paul said now that you're a christian that's that's o.u.t she's the ground is level she doesn't either male or female she stands level at the foot of the cross with you she's your sister in christ and you're to lead her by example and love her as christ's love of the church that's that's seventh seal teaching that's not psychology so so you understand see i'm i'm trying to broaden your minds today so when people say we want we want to see pentecost sadly what they mean is is a very narrow look at we want to see signs and wonders and they and anything else that's not that becomes you know they they they disparage that that's wrong i want to say today publicly on the internet that's unbalanced that's not that's not the balanced message we've received it is it does include and happily so signs and wonders in the power of god and say do you want to see it i want to see it and more of it and when we get more of it and i want to see more still and i'll never because i i know that that's coming from another realm and i want to get everything possible and then some and if you don't want it i'll take yours i'll be happy to see but but but don't be so narrow-minded as to forget all of its pentecost all new testament teaching is pentecost so just put that in your mind all right so now i i i want that in your mind as we start looking forward now you're going to see brother branham talk about i had some wonderful quotes sent to me by a very good friend and i loved them they're just so good and so informative there's there's many more that could be read as i said i'm i've called a bunch of stuff down all right so brother branham and i just want to make some observations as we go you still with me all right i know the next thing to happen is the restoration of the gifts there's a strange statement and i mean azusa had happened in 1906. and here's the prophet saying i i know the next thing to happen is the restoration of the gifts to the church and it's the hardest thing i've had to do in this pioneering work is to do this as to see the the people that god cannot give back the gifts to the church as long as his church is divided we've got to get the church together first for the gifts can come see so now so now let me let me just let me just point out that it's very obvious that brother branham is not denying the azusa revival and the gifts that begin to operate what he's trying to tell the church is is you guys are getting shortchanged and it's your fault that there that the gifts now are ready to go to another level but because you fractured and denominated and split up and started bickering and fighting i'm here to tell you you have stalled them amen they've been stalled they're they're here god is ready to do them they're in prophecy but but you're hindering them because why because you're fighting each other you got schism in your ranks don't forget that that's a big point if it stopped it in 1948 it's stopping it in in 2008 and it'll stop being still be stopping it in 2028 if the lord tarries among the true church who ought to be experiencing these things and brother branham is going to talk about it here in just a few minutes because these remember these are promises these are as i as i said to you these are uh god's promises to the last age the restoration of all things and so let's go so now he says but if if all the full gospel people would come one heart and one accord there would be a revival now remember this is a principle this isn't just stuck in 1948. this is for now but if all the full gospel people would come one heart and one accord there would be a revival that would shake the whole world and every say every every spiritual gift would be in the church within an hour's time after it took place that's pretty shocking and the only reason it took an hour was because it has to go global and shake the whole world brother branham talks about a meeting he said if i had everybody in this meeting and perfect one mind and one accord he said there wouldn't be a need for a hospital in five minutes see all right watch signs and wonders that was done by the apostles would be a minor thing to what would do if we could just get the church together it's got to happen it will happen it may be after i've passed off the scene but i want to put my word in this that you might know that my voice is this oh christian people bind yourselves together with one heart and one accord isn't that beautiful with one heart and one accord for god cannot no more send the gifts to the church while the church is separated then he can send the holy ghost unless we're in one accord that's right for it comes by the holy ghost see and we are to believe it all right oops now let's go on that's 48. let's jump several years to 53. there's a lot of quotes that say the same thing in between it is to my humble belief that we're living near the end time or may i make it a little more personal than that saying we're living in the end time i believe and i've started saying to you we're living in the end of the end time all right i believe it's time for restoration of the church that was promised that god would send in the last day now obviously this is the return of the jubilee this is coming under the opening of the seals and so brother branham is preparing the hearts when it happens you need to be ready because you it could happen and you not be ready and you say oh there's a problem with god's word no yeah god can't get it done that's not true god will get it done somebody through somebody i just want it to be me i want it to be you i want to be a part of that and i believe that this is the day that when the word has been preached so much and the days getting so dark and evil till according to god's word he was to restore all that the caterpillar had eaten the palmer worm had eaten will be restored back again you believe that it will be restored back again and this is the day of the restoration of the spiritual gifts given into the church 1959 but now we need it the spirit of god raises a standard what is it he's pouring in his spirit i love that he's pouring in his spirit then those who are resting out yonder in the grave or under the altar of god as the scripture says are crying how long lord how long he realized later under the opening of the seals that's jews crying under the fifth seal how much longer you have to understand the message was progressive to william branham see god's waiting now watch this god's waiting on me and you the church is waiting on me and you adoption time what does that even mean when god can pour into us his fullness his power his resurrection that when the church and christ become so close together till christ becomes visible among us how many are for that and raises the dead and we go into the rapture that screen is not working if somebody could attend to that that screen is not working just make sure this one stays all right i got one here make sure that one stays working all right so so christ becomes visible among us and raises the dead all right now we'll go to 19 um 16. a pentecostal branch filled with the holy ghost signs and wonders and the resurrection i'm telling you what brother branham is is saying to you should be here and is coming all right a pentecostal branch filled with the holy ghost signs and wonders and the resurrection great things taking place among them they who know their god in the last days shall do exploits yes we're at the end time now so brother branham has done two things and now let me just encapsulate for a minute let's just review he has shown you secondly what should be happening what is going to happen what is happening has is and is coming but he has but he began it i began the quotes by showing you that even if it's when it's been here when it's here or when it comes in a greater way what hinders it we found out what hinders it is schism and fighting and divisions amen all right i'm just making sure you're staying with me all right so they'll do great exploits yes we're at the end time now we're going to make a jump five more years to 1965 well after the seals have been opened all right so brother branham says here does god change his mind does he by his word he doesn't change his mind about his word now may i say this they thought now this this is the story where um they joseph and mary came with the jesus was a little boy and they went to the feast and all that and then headed home they thought he was in the group of in the in the in the you know the group of family and they get many many miles away and find out nobody knows where he is and he's back in the temple as 12 years old preaching to the doctors all right and they thought he was with them all right but he wasn't all right so he says now may i say this they thought he was along but they found out in the crisis don't get in a crisis and find out he's not near you don't get in a crisis this world is filled with crisis you are you have either just come out of a crisis or a trial or you are in a truck crisis or trial or you are headed for a crisis or a trial the world is falling apart don't find yourself in a crisis or in a trial and he's not near you see now since he promised to never leave you it becomes obvious who left who get me all right enough said now we find out that in the time when this great thing has been brought up and we found out that we're missing something in our churches now this is 65 and that is the power of christ now i want to make a statement here he says now look and i'll tell i'll make statement a second now look i don't want to criticize i love you and genuine true love always is corrective now we're missing christ in our church now you're going to see here very clearly that brother branham is talking to pentecostal churches all right because he's going to he's going he's going to because the power of god is moving among the bride but he's saying there's no power in your churches so he's you have to understand that in 1965 and you you'd need old-timers to give you this sister gene could give you a real expose on it that that in 1965 i mean what we enjoy today we have message churches all over the world and you have books and tapes and cds and internet and archives and all this in 1965 there you really didn't have that you you had a prophet with a message and you had people going to meetings but really as far as a message church you had tucson you had jeffersonville and you kind of could make an argument for louisiana although it turned out that that you know went went sideways shortly after brother branham left and so so really i mean you didn't have this global community of global churches you understand so so so brother branham is obviously not talking to what we have now become global in our footprint message churches because i'm here to tell you we do have the power of god thank god we do have the power of god and it is moving and this this church i could spend the rest of the day and every person in here could stand up and tell some great miracle that god has done even recently see so so so so just just keep this straight but now you say well then why then why bother reading this to us brother jason if he's not even talking to us because the principles of what causes it can affect us and limit god moving even though we have the truth and are preaching the truth see all right i'm gonna just make a statement tip you off a little bit i i hope by the end of today and i don't think i'll get finished i'm gonna i'm watching the clock i hope by the end of today that you can see something greater that we should be pursuing you say you say well you know there's the whole almost like a civil war between intellectualism and emotionalism well there shouldn't be any war for the family of god because both of those are wrong intellectualism emotional ism is just as bad as denominational see so it's it's not all it's not always the people in the dominations it's the system see so now but so so then but then there is there now now listen i'm going to make another turn there absolutely is a very good truth laying in the intellectual study and teaching of god's word teaching's what establishes churches there is also emotion that should be striven for i believe that when you come in here the worship leaders should be prayed up the musicians should be prayed up the people coming should be prayed up there should be an expectation when the worship starts you should raise your hands you should lift your voice there should be great word coming forth balance there should also be and we should strive for both of them amen i'm going to present to you today and hope to prove that there's another element that is superior to even both of those in combination now without those two you would never get to this greater one but because we have the word and because we have the spirit of god now we want to know then what's then what could be possibly brother jason what could possibly be greater than those two things the thing that makes both of them function the thing that makes them work if you don't have that which makes them work yes they're great but you don't have access to them because you don't have that which makes them go it's the it's that's what i'm preaching on today what makes it go all right so i'm tipping you off so now here he is he's showing us these principles all right now we're missing christ amongst our pentecostal people let me get to the correct keep up with myself here our brothers and sisters there is something wrong the old-fashioned prayer meetings they used to have all day and night they don't have them no more our women used to wear long hair they don't do it anymore see so he's not talking to message churches that what we have become as message churches because we do pray and our women don't bob off their hair it would be a disgrace for a woman to paint and use paint back in the early days and act the way these women do something went wrong nothing wrong with christ see but something went wrong something is somewhere all right now watch let's keep moving you know brother ernie used to have a a poignant question that he never got an answer to because nobody was willing to answer it and brother ernie came up through church of god and then upc and then from upc to the message and he come from catholicism to to uh to an evangelical then to church of god then to upc and he's kept graduating graduating until he got to the to the full message and brother ernie goes back and starts talking to those leaders and he says here's brother here's my only question they said oh you've went off the deep end he said okay oh okay i'm off the deep end but please just help me and answer this question now we know by history and none of these men would argue it was very clear in history we know by history that our original pentecostal azusa revival fathers taught that for a woman to cut her hair off was against the scripture it taught that a woman to put on a garment that pertains to a man was against god's bible that's not a william branham doctrine that's a that's a moses doctrine cutting hair is not a william branham doctrine that's a saint paul doctrine all right you'll have a problem with paul and moses not william branham on the other side so so we find he says now they used to say that women shouldn't paint their face up like jezebel we used to our men didn't used to smoke and drink and corrals and curse and gamble and womanize so now they they taught against that see and now everybody's allowed to do it he said so my my simple question is this were we wrong when we started or are we wrong as we're finishing which is it just tell me are did we start wrong or are we finishing wrong and brother ernie got the door quickly they were not interested in even addressing that question but it's a fair question see something went wrong nothing wrong with christ see but something went wrong something is somewhere don't get afraid i'm watching the clock i can feel a little bit of nervousness because i'm going slow i'm not going to go long you all know me i don't do that all right so just sit tight we're learning something right the pulpit used to wouldn't have permitted such a thing as that but it does now see the crisis is on and we're missing something we're missing power that we ought to have so i think we can fairly surmise that if we wanna one of the quickest ways to short-circuit our power is for is for the pulpit to start allowing women to cut their hair wear makeup and pants and men to start drinking cussing corrals and gambling i'd say that would pretty effectively kill the power of god so since i'd rather have the power of god i don't intend to let this pulpit allow that see all right is that okay amen you still want to keep me in all right thank you so now we're missing the power we ought to have where the big machine ought to be running up and great signs and wonders well this building ought to be sitting so full of the power of god now till a sinner couldn't stay in here the holy spirit condemning it right quickly like that like ananias and sapphira and we are missing something goes to the god of this evil age i'm just going i'm going um chronologically but then i'm gonna when i switch gears i got to drop back and then i'll go chronologically again so just hang on uh the god of this evil age now she has caused the whole world to accept the scientific leadership of the educational program that satan has given to her under the name of a church this is the antichrist spirit all right that was prophesied the same bible that prophesied a restoration of the word also prophesied this is the day of the antichrist all right now where he he's always been but this is the day where he really comes into his ride okay now watch and what it what what is the antichrist works through a through a woman it's a church now she has cause because woman in the bible is the church always she has caused the whole world to accept the scientific leadership of the educational program that satan has given to her under the name of a church the leadership of an educational scientific program i'm picturing to you the god of this world so i think we ought to be firmly against approaching the word in an intellectual scientific way i think it ought to still be accompanied by the power and demonstration of the holy spirit and it ought to be preached as a living word see now don't confuse that with bible teaching bible teaching isn't even geared or designed to be to be uh emotional because because when you're you miss it you'll miss the whole lesson that teaching is meant to be brother branham says that in quotes and i've got him if i get to him today he teaches that on tape all right he's comparing the difference between peter being a firebrand because he wasn't a teacher but brother branham says but paul was more scholarly like teaching see so and brother branham says god has many mansions in my father's house are many men she's got all kinds and so i'm opposed to some of our evangelists running around today and like honest to goodness think they're trying to make all the preachers evangelists and if they're not preaching like an evangelist is preaching they must be a psychology man and not called and not gifted anyway not here to get on a rant so when when she as eve had the very filling of god's word in her hand she could have took god's word but what did she do to that instead of tarrying for the baptism of the holy ghost let science prove to her that the holy ghost was only for the disciples see so brother branham says now you've got a little clear understanding when brother branham talks about eve said she would have eventually come to that she would it's that's what the holy ghost eve see when she as eve had the very filling of god's word in her hand which eve had fortified behind the word she would have come to that experience god was progressing to a whole family he's going to build a whole kingdom see all right so so he says he let science prove to her that the holy ghost was only for the disciples instead of keeping divine healing going when she ought to be now raising the dead and doing great miracles she has let satan under his leadership of religious man take the word of god and try to say that it was for another age and she's disbelieved it when the bible says that the things that i do shall you do also jesus said that go into all the world and preach that means to demonstrate the gospel to every creature we're still creatures these signs shall follow every one of them that believe she denies every bit of it so of course this is the remnants of the azusa revival a real message church doesn't deny any of that if it does it's not a message church see it's become a message denomination listen friends you can be followers of the message and not be a believer of the word you absolutely can just because you follow the teachings of the message doesn't mean you're born again see it doesn't even mean that you even believe all the word see so and now so now here here's the sad part oh she denied let's see yeah they can get to that uh instead of keeping so she's leaving and when the bible says things that i do show you also jesus said go you know okay we read that these sons shall follow every one of them that believe she denies every bit of it all right oh i found myself okay she denies all the supernatural and she swapped it for his intellectual conception of the bible so we are firmly adamantly uh diametrically opposed to intellectual conception i am against it i preach against it i preach in a fire-breathing experience of the living god because he's alive and you can know him in a living way see she swapped it for his intellectual conception of the bible where priest and holy father so-called where bishops archbishops or district president presbyters over general overseer and so forth has put their own interpretation to it and god has left them set there dead as twelve o'clock and we can see that all right the only things left in the last days is a bunch of little pentecostals with a bunch of music whooped up as hard as they can run up and down the floors speaking in tongues and shouting i'm all against powerful worship music i'm all for powerful worship music i'm all for the operation of the gifts i'm all for the opera i'd like to i'd like to see all the gifts in operation i'd also like to see all of the of the fruits of the spirit see so if you if you're gonna if you're gonna champion for the gifts champion for the fruits as well of patience and temperance and meekness and holiness and godliness and love kindness amen hallelujah so so so let's let's let's have all of it all right so so he says now this is the only thing they've got left all right and having here now here's what invalidates their music whooped up as hard as they can running up and down the floor speaking tongues shouting saying there's anything wrong with running them down the floor speaking in tongues good music no nothing wrong with that here's what short circuited it having a form of godliness they come to church they you know it's like the old the old tv commercial from way back in the day that i haven't seen in 40 years so i just want to make that clear you know when the guy comes on there and somehow this is supposed to imbibe you with confidence in some drug and he's standing there in a white coat in his glasses and he says i'm not a doctor but i play one on tv and you're supposed to go oh my goodness i got to get that drug and and i i said to the church one time i said you know i don't want to see you walk in here all dressed up you know sharp and dressed to the nines and come in here and say and you know and say i'm not a christian but i play one on sundays i'm not actually a christian but i play one in front of other people see now that's the attitude of the world this is what they did having a form of godliness but denying the word thereof tell them to be baptized in the name of jesus christ laugh in your face but that god goes right on making it so just the same proving his word to be stowed you happy for that says now we are going to use this like a sunday school lesson it's not directed to any uh certain uh anything or any certain person or anything just to the church body now he's coming to the invisible union now now you're about to now you're about to see him start to transition now he's not just making it known here's the problem in the so-called pentecostal churches but now he's going to start transitioning to talk to the bride who who has been come on the scene birthed by the word she was an infant when the seals were open now she's got some mileage under her feet she's growing up and now he's going to start training this bride how to not make the mistake of the of the pentecostal people all right how many want that it's not directed to anything any certain person or anything just to the church the body of christ that we're trying to lead to deeper thoughts and higher objectives believing that the coming of the lord jesus is at hand we believe that much more it's 20 years closer than it was the first time i come to shreveport oh so much has happened since that time we're looking forward for the coming of the lord in our generation look at this next line i'm not looking for revival in our generation i'm looking for the coming of the lord in our generation now let me just let me just say this it's obvious by the scriptures and by brother branham's other teaching that brother branham is not doubting revival what what brother branham is saying that we have reached the last age and this is the last call to the gentile church remember it's the gentile church who misses the rapture she goes in the tribulation she's the remnant of the woman's seed only the elect lady goes in the rapture only the bride because the church kicked christ out according to revelation 3 and he's standing on the outside of the church she's no longer his mouthpiece she's become her own mouthpiece and she she oh and what is she intellectualism and emotionalism and that's it's all wind and no sails and it's it's it's it's no way no way to go it's completely out of order it's upside down and the power of god has abandoned them say do they have miracles not the greatest one the greatest miracle is to change life the greatest miracle is to reach into a realm that no power can reach down into the soul and activate a gene of god and that power is missing once that power hits and you have that and it brings that gene to life i'll promise you signs and wonders and miracles and the power of god will follow that you won't have to work it up see we've seen that by experience so he he's certainly not he's certainly not saying he's certainly not saying when i'm not looking for a revival in our generation i'm looking for the coming of the lord he's he's not saying go down to the pier because the old ship of zion is coming go down there and sit on your luggage amen because the revival's over what he's saying is is that the age is coming to an end and the next revival there's a revival coming but it's going to israel to the jews once the bride is gone you're clear see so he's saying now and then also you can infer in this statement by his other teachings by everything he said that what we have why why why wh why are we not going to get another outpouring of the holy spirit brother brown talks about a fresh surge and a refilling i believe it will be a refilling of the baptism of the holy ghost of course all of those things are to us but it's all contained in the word and it's all contained in the promises i'm preaching today about what is hindering some of those promises you know it's the fresh surge of the holy spirit is not somewhere over the rainbow the the the latter rain is not somewhere over the rainbow that the opening of the word is the former and latter rain moderately coming in the same month once you have of a field that has come back to grain which we have and then the august then that then the you you get what's called a harvest rain that's the anointing of christ coming down on his word through a prophet and breaking the bread of life and it becomes the living bread the living water and he says i'm not looking for another revival of course not because every wheat farmer knows once you've had the harvest rain what does that do that pushes the the grain now to ripen see it's green but now it's got to ripen it's got to lay in the presence of the sun and if you have another rain you ruin that crop you don't want another rain you need to harvest it before the next rain see so so we know we're not looking for rain after the harvest ladder rain because it'll ruin the crop and so it became clear that a bride who would believe every word of god would have to be called out of the systems of man-made organization because those powers are to be working in he or she who believes these signs shall follow them amen so the power to bring life to a gene the the power the power of the supernatural to heal the sick and open blinded eyes and raise the dead and joyce say do we have that power sure we have that power i've seen that power operate i've seen miracles right standing right here i've across the ocean and seen the same kind of miracles we've got brothers who report on on a regular basis the dead being raised that's not hard uh for for god to do see all right so then so then where does what does it come to all right now watch he's really starting to zero in now i'm gonna take my my my last 21 minutes all right and if i don't finish we'll just push pause and we'll jump out and pull the chute and land and we'll catch up to you wednesday or not it won't be me but next sunday so he says here i believe that's the same thing we live in today god bearing record this is things that are to be god bearing record of his word by vindicating what he said he would do now we know that this is the day of salvation where god is calling men from the world from a life of sin unto a life of service and in the day that god has poured out his spirit from on high great signs and wonders are to accompany the ministry of this day this is when the former and latter rain are falling together and we know that there is supposed to be great signs and wonders which in many great denominations this is turned down communion come as his lat one of his last his last sermon actually you know the hour will soon arise when right among us the holy spirit will speak out like it did in ananias and sapphira remember see the hour is arriving now you just remember that and god is going to dwell among his people that's what he wants to do now all right all right now let me take you to this to this quote here and i i made a statement here i'm going to read this very quickly and from here i'm going to really try to speed up so brother branham says in the god of this evil age okay now we're coming to laying this is the section now i want to come to today and this is where i'm going to take my last 18 minutes laying in the presence of the sun now i tipped you off we must have good bible fundamental instruction and teaching and it must deal with baptism and the serpent seed and election and husbands and children and finances it must it must identify false anointed ones it must identify the indictment amen it's all of that it's all the seventh seal see but we must also strive to bring you know it's it's worth it i want to say to brother anthony and to all of the other worship leaders that fill in that it's worth it to come out here and push the people it's worth it to come out prayed up it's worth it musicians it's worth it for you to meet back there early and be practiced and be ready and be inspired come out here because you're part you're welcoming the presence of almighty god we're not here just for our uh uh we're not here for just a jericho march we're here to welcome the presence of god if that breaks into a jericho march glory be to god ain't seen one of those in a while but i'm here to tell you it's worth it when you have young people listen let me defend it a little bit it's worth it when you have young people who are over who are just deluged their senses are deluged every kind of screen in front of their eyes and every kind of spectacular unbelievable you know computer animation and every you you can't you can't ima you can't amaze americans by anything had a russian sister say that to me one time said it very sincerely trying to give me a little simple handmade gift she said i know you can't amaze americans by anything but my mother and i we made this wanted you to have it and i took it and i just thought about that statement i thought that is so true and and and you and your brothers and everywhere we go and it's in mcdonald's in walmart it's everywhere it's on the streets you pull up to a light it's everywhere your your senses are assaulted and and so you you naturally it i'm here to tell you it takes something to come out here and say come on clap your hands come on come on get them clapping come on tap those feet come on let's sing come on and you hear the song they're saying lift up your hands why does he have to say that because you need to hear it so there it's it's value i i see the value in in in in a youth camp where they're trying to where they're trying to arouse the young people because what they're trying to say oh it's just a pep rally sometimes it is but don't discount the value don't discount the value that you sometimes they come from churches where they just sit like statues and nobody's afraid to move and you got to get them moving and get the blood going and come on get get them past their awkward teeny awkwardness and get them worshipping god go back three or four days later at the end of it and those who were standing there like this now they're raising their hands and now they're praising god now say what does that do for them that activates their faith so they can believe the word of god so don't be against that for the sake of being against it there's value in that but see but then but then don't disparage the man who just comes with a fundamental lesson to teach some principle about the word of god see as if there's some fight between those i'm here to tell you there's no fight in the holy ghost he's he's about both of those see so too often times it's immature preachers creating a fight where there's not really a fight see so [Music] i shouldn't have said that i apologize i don't want to disparage anything or anybody but there is no fight in the holy ghost we read that's the thing that will keep the gifts from working that division is what will hinder the holy spirit from working oh i to move on so brother branham says here oh i want to say this so now here is that middle part that i told you that makes this side and this side work they're both great the intellectual concepts of the word and teaching the deep things of god or teaching about families and finances and children these things are fundamental truths and then the the free-flowing worship and the electric atmospheres of the holy ghost these are all part of god's plan but the thing that makes them work properly is laying in the presence of the sun that's why i titled this series in the presence of the s-o-n say what does that even mean lay in the presence of the sun you're going to see it's more than a cliche all right i got a few minutes left hang on all right just as your natural life and traits is handed down from the natural breeding of your father so is the spirit of god that was predestined before the foundation of the world when the entire word of god is complete was headed up in a human body called jesus christ in there i love this god made me pay for my sins in him there so it's done settled you're free that's it you're free you're done that's it you're free and whatever you've ever done whatever you're guilty of today what you might stumble in tomorrow it's over it's done god has already made you pay for your sins in christ at calvary that's finished don't let the devil keep hindering you from that see then he rose me raised me up with him in the resurrection and now we are seated with him with power and authority over every devil oh if you could only believe what god has given watch this now but if you're not seated there you don't have it and if you're seated there if you're seated there and don't believe it and afraid to move you'll never use it [Music] so why that's why we need fundamental teaching that's why because teaching teaches you how to use it that's why we need some emotion i don't like anything dead i want to see it preached in power received in power rejoiced in over with power see and that's what'll make it function but if you're seated there you will use it for your ordain to do what you do and i said to you a couple services ago so whatever the lord needs to do to get you in position he'll use whatever means necessary he'll use whatever means are necessary see and uh might be some rough water but just remember when it comes to his family god sends god allows judgment on his family but it's always to to invoke repentance it's never to punish god can't punish you for what christ already was punished for christ was already punished for anything you'd ever do wrong but what he does do is allow judgments to come on your life to invoke repentance so that you'll come back and say father i'm sorry forgive me please help me see so so then he goes on i gotta i gotta go fast now he says i'm coming to you with a message that that sign vindicated what what did the church no it never denominated but what happened to the denominations over this revival what did they do they went straight into laodicea millions and millions and billions of dollars poured into it and she's just a big bunch of big and rich and she builds million dollars worth of property and things like that and to receive the message no indeedy they turn it away what is it the husk pulling away from the wheat see the husk is pulling away that he says now the he um because i added that in there he says the husk from away from the wheat meaning she's pulling away he says it correctly several other times all right so he says it's the husk pulling away now the wheat must be that way so you have to be rejected of the world you had to come out of them had to get clear of that see the wheat must be that way to lay in the presence of the sun to turn to a full gospel golden grain for the master that's the reason that's why you have to separate from friends sometimes even associates and things in the world that's why you can't you can't play you know too closely with even nominal christian friends say but they're good people of course they are they might make it to heaven for all i know if they believe in christ the son of god they'll make it to heaven see they the god there's a remnant of the woman's seed in the the new heavens and the new earth and even the millennium will be filled with millions of people who never knew anything about this message never believed it at all even heard it and rejected it and will still end up there but what i'm saying to you is you can't run too close into that circle because that prevents you from laying in the presence of the sun because you're always you know under this pressure and peer pressure to kind of compromise in your life and when you're living a compromised life now you're not laying in the presence of the sun see so he says you're a man running from the presence of the lord now i'm giving you that middle tool that makes this side and this side work in balance but the wheat has to lay in the presence of the sun to ripen and that's what we're here for friends stay in the presence of the sun till our little group of people here till it becomes so ripe to christ it become bread on his table that's what i want to do that's what i want to do see this is what keeps these balanced if you don't have this you might have these but they'll be they'll be all out of balance it's it's this is what brings them together this is the key a lot of people love deep teaching and a lot of people love to run the aisles but when it comes to the surrendered life to lay before god and separate from the world and get rid of all the loyalty sin poisons and toxins that's where people start to struggle see that is the most important thing this is the most important thing this invalidates the argument of of teaching versus demotion it makes it renders that argument silly it makes that argument ridiculous and and if one side is attacking this side or this side's attacking this side they're all ding-dongs they're missing the point what people need is consecrated lives now you have the power of god moving it's not about how fast you can whip up the music or how deep an intellectual you can teach it none of that stuff will stay in balance if you don't have a surrendered heart and a clean mind before god see bread on his table oh look at eight minutes christ is revealed in his own word the thing that's the matter with the message today now we're not talking about the pentecostal churches now we're talking about the message the thing that's the matter with the message today is is people uh you know don't like emotion oh i'm sorry let me start over the thing that's the matter with the message today is people you know they they don't like deep teaching the problem is it's those who obtain it in their hearts must lay in the presence of the sun to get ripened you can pick up the message and then let the sun bake all the greenness out of you see making matured christians see what i mean god is coming soon to receive his church and we must have that type of christians for him to receive the wheat has to get ripe the wheat has to get ripe see invisible union it's the grain it can't go no further we're at the end time so what does it have to do now lay in the presence of the sun to be ripened that's exactly the word to be ripened in your heart to bring forth and live what we're talking about amen why in the world as a preacher would i spend five seconds filling your minds with fighting words attacking some other kind of a movement oh they're against pentecostal oh well all they are is pentecostal bethel tabernacle stay out of that be spiritual switzerland and just stay neutral and say i got one motive and i want to lay in the presence of the son that's what i want to teach my young people that's what i want to teach married people we want the deeper things of god but we want the power of god moving and there's a way there's a truth and a way to have that accomplished and it comes by balanced fundamentals of teaching both sides believing both sides and pressing for both sides see i'd catch a preacher preaching that in our youth camp he would never preach again at my youth camp all rilling the people up and and and getting young people just angry and getting old people angry i mean my goodness what do you want what's everybody gonna do i mean we got these message gangs they're just message gangs some of them got a thug mentality and sometimes i see things go on and i say what are they trying to do get their gang to everybody grab their spiritual switchblades and baseball bats and let's hit the streets and have a rumble let's go attack the other message gang where's the love of god you're never going to have the power of god moving [Applause] that's that's wrong that's imbalanced that's immature i'm here to tell you bride is getting ready for a body change glory to god all right i got four and a half minutes you got a seat belt on you're gonna need it the invisible union it's it it's the grain it can't go no further we're at the end time see we're at the uh we're at the um we're at the end time so what does it have to do now push for more emotion teach deeper things form more camps attack the other camps what does it have to do lay in the presence of the sun to be ripened that's exactly the word to be ripened in your heart to bring forth and live what we're talking about whoops as far as we'll go today you can take it down matt if ripeness is missing you'll misrepresent the acts of the spirit i'm going to be real deliberative with my two and a half minutes and two minutes of overtime if ripeness is missing you'll misinterpret the acts of the spirit and you operate gifts in the wrong way and you'll push for the wrong things in a in a fit of imbalance and every minister is supposed to take the spiritual hippocratic oath to do no harm because we are doctors i i have a different kind of a medical book than doc meredith has or dr andrew i have a different medical book than they have but we do the same job one does it physically out one does it spiritually you'd be surprised how many times we confer notes and go yeah i've had that problem well here's what i did about it you might try it in the natural it might work and come back to me it worked perfect and then i might be calling them what do you do about a case like this well okay i'll try that spiritually and boom it worked call it back up it worked ripeness by laying in the presence of the sun it facilitates or it it it makes the way for the proper operation of the power of god ripeness laying in the presence of the sun ripeness makes the way for the proper functioning of the gifts of the spirit of god you'll always get out of balance operating the gifts if you have immature unripeness ripeness facilitates or it makes the way for gifts of the holy ghost to operate in correct biblical order ripeness makes the way for the fruit of the spirit to flow through you unhindered because you're dead your thinking is gone you've surrendered you want you've laid in the presence till the mind of christ has so permeated you you are you you become a conduit how many want to be a conduit for the gifts of the spirit the the the fruits of the spirit you want to be a conduit for the fruits of the spirit i'm here to tell you you'll do more for your teenagers you'll do more for your lost family members you'll do more for your next door neighbors you'll do more for your boss or your employees if you are an unfattered conduit of the spirit of almighty god it doesn't take deeper teaching to get that nor does it take emphasizing all kinds of emotion what it takes is laying in the presence of the sun ripeness makes the way for the token to be on display amen thank you mom makes the way for the token to be on display to the world properly a lot of times people think the only token i have to display is god sent a prophet well what you're supposed to display is that jesus christ has come back to the earth again and is living in his people that's what you say well how did that happen by a prophet through a prophetic ministry but that's that's the vehicle that's what god did the the whole thing is now christ in you the hope of glory ripeness is you listen friends i'm i'm closing ripeness i'm on my last point just let me make it thoroughly can i ripeness is you is you allowing the holy ghost to add to your faith virtue and divert your knowledge and to knowledge temperance and to temperance patience and to patience godliness and to godliness brotherly kindness and to brotherly kindness charity for if these things be in you and abound if you've been laying in the presence of the sun and with ripeness they're abounding they make you not help you they make you that ye shall neither be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our lord jesus christ but he that has not laid in the presence of the son he who is not ripe but he that lack of these things is blind cannot see afar off and has forgotten that he was purged from his old sins so you're always living a life of reactionary you're always reacting because you don't have any vision you don't you don't see seeds of discrepancy in your home you let them all in the door your children get polluted by it and the next thing you know you're dealing with a crisis that you should have saw coming you find carnality in your lives and parents and sometimes can be the worst examples to their children or the best examples to their children and all the preaching i can do till the cows come home cannot save your children if you're living an opposite life of what i'm preaching we're all in this thing together it's all for one and one for all see so if these things are not in our lives and abounding if they're not abounding then what are we not letting the word do in us because you have to let the mind amen which was in christ be in you you have to let the word dwell in you richly paul said that to believers who had been believers for 30 years full of the holy ghost paul speaking to people with the holy ghost experience said i want you to know all the fullness wait a minute you mean there's more than the holy ghost there's the fullness of the holy ghost living through you unfettered now you're christ in flesh that's the whole purpose of the message that's why it came that's why we're here that's why you believe so if these things are not in our lives and abounding then we are not letting the word what then what are it's a question then what are we not letting the word do in us i had to ask myself that same question i'm the one wrote it on my notes and i typed it out and sat back and stared at it jason what are you not letting the word do in you so i want to see more power and demonstration the holy ghost i want to have more overcoming victory i want to i want to see the power of god in prayer well then then it's here the word promises it should be here then what am i not letting the word accomplish what in your daily life is blocking those precious promises from operating in you i told you better have a seatbelt on we know i'm in overtime i know i'm promising i'm on my last notes just hold on i got about that that many lines we know that we are in the time of these things to be fully operational if you don't if you don't understand bible prophecy then come see me we know we're in the time that they should be fully operational we know we have a vindicated message it's beyond question and we can see that the key is not just good teaching that we strive for and rightly so we strive for it rightly so rightly so we strive for it but we can see that the key is not just good teaching that we rightly strive for nor is the key emotional atmospheres that we rightly strive for nothing almost nothing upsets me more than to be trying to lead worship and people look like a brother donnie says uh not a a not on a log or a bump on a pickle is that it brad boom pickle think about that bubs we like pickles me and noah and sister gene we love pickles don't we mom i don't want us to be a bump on a pickle a not on a log listen friends we want to be in the stature of a perfect man not a statue we got enough statues we can see that it's not just good teaching that we strive for or emotional atmospheres that we strive for the key to the supernatural is being born again and laying in the presence of the sun so so so when we having said all that so when we don't see the supernatural in our midst or if we don't see overcoming power in our lives then it begs the question what are we laying in the presence of what are you you're supposed to be laying in the presence of the s-o-n and that brings these promises to past so just ask yourself this question if you don't see the overcoming power of god in your life then what are you spending your time laying in the presence of that's obviously not the s-o-n i'm afraid it's too often too many other things overlaying in the presence of the sun i'll say it again i'm afraid that it's too often too many times we are laying in the presence of other things instead of laying our lives in the presence of the sun amen brother anthony bring your team brother bow your heads right where you sit just stay seated and bow your heads too often times we find ourselves laying in the presence of other things have thine own way lord dab please have thine own way thou art the potter i am the clay just softly there's a lot more that i want to say and we will say as we continue to open this up but i know i have enough discernment in me to know today that like me you felt very penetrated by the word of god like me you may be sitting in the presence of god right now and you're aware you've got a you've got a photo album of yourself and all the time you're spending laying in the presence of this thing or that thing or this other thing or that other thing and somehow laying in the presence of the sun all heads bowed all eyes closed please somehow that laying in the presence of the sun has fallen down the list of priorities now you know you know the holy spirit's got your number you know he does you know he's got your address today now i'm gonna i'm gonna i'm gonna lead by example if you know that today and this word has penetrated you and you want to make amends with the lord why don't you raise up your hands i'm going to put both of mine up because i can find too many areas in my life where i have not laid in the presence of the sun and i don't see the power and overcoming strength that i feel i need or know i should have i know this message is true my goodness hands are everywhere we know this message is true we know it's real we know we're at the end time we know there can't be time left we're at the end of the end time i want to tell you something friends let me give you some word of encouragement god sees the heart down under that hand don't you think he does and he knows he sees you in ways you can't even put in words he's the god of he's the god of all men not just the god of good men he's the god of all men jesus jesus loves his children i'm going to tell you something friends jesus loves the backslider the bible says god says i'm married to the backslider god knows how to bring your heart back and warm you strangely god knows how to bring the spirit of god back into your life my hand's still up everywhere goodness oh these are people lord i'm looking at people who who love you lord who want to know you in this way that they've heard described today father i

of the wall and the aisles and everywhere in between in the nursery on the internet across the stream lord we we lift up holy hands and say oh lord god oh lord jesus help me today father i want to be

magical thing oh god that no man is capable of bringing they can't even bring it on their self all they can do is repent and stay humble and say father remember me remember me we love you today lord
