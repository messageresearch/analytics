[22:36] headship we are your
[22:39] subjects to do your bidding that you may

[22:57] time
[22:59] as I wait on you so many times I feel

[23:07] things in my

[23:18] day we
[23:20] want pure faith in a pure
[23:26] word that knows nothing can Shake
[23:30] us nothing can sway us nothing can turn
[23:33] our heads even for a

[24:00] thanks you may be
[24:02] seated you may be seated too because it
[24:06] takes me
[24:08] minute
[24:11] thank
[24:14] okay
[24:18] um it's a clumsy time isn't
[24:27] it
[24:57] e
[25:27] e
[25:57] e
[26:27] e
[26:57] e
[27:27] e e
[28:01] and so we have to be very
[28:04] careful as humans what we say and how we
[28:07] say
[28:09] it because I have found over the years
[28:14] that
[28:15] words have definitions so when it comes
[28:18] to concrete things like Pulpit or
[28:22] chair no question car no question but
[28:27] when it comes to things of the spirit
[28:30] and the soul and things
[28:34] specifically pertaining to the things of
[28:36] the Lord I found some very troubling
[28:40] things that words are defined by
[28:45] experience and sometimes those
[28:47] experiences are not good experiences and
[28:50] sometimes
[28:51] those experiences altar so we have been
[28:57] many times brother
[28:59] Jason when you're talking to someone
[29:02] with every good intent in your heart to
[29:05] help to encourage to
[29:08] build and
[29:10] yet what I
[29:13] said because of the person's
[29:17] experiences all of the words that I said
[29:19] went through a filter and totally
[29:21] perverted
[29:23] everything and now I'm going to give you
[29:25] some examples personally from my own
[29:32] experience I spiritually grew up in
[29:35] a
[29:38] very my first
[29:41] church very troubled experience with
[29:44] nickel hon Spirit
[29:46] there
[29:50] and
[29:54] after 11
[29:56] years I had to leave because I
[29:58] spiritually
[29:59] died and I didn't leave the church to
[30:02] run from Jesus I ran to find him
[30:08] again the church went from a group of
[30:12] about 350 people to about
[30:17] 10 and as they
[30:20] all go by on their way to the bars
[30:32] I said can we talk the
[30:35] word let's just get into the word and
[30:38] when I would mention the word the
[30:41] word they would shudder I mean visibly
[30:47] shutter
[30:49] because the
[30:52] word those
[30:54] words became a hammer and an assault and
[30:58] and killed them can you imagine
[31:02] that so here I want to do something and
[31:06] take them into a place of safety and
[31:09] growth and here they are filtering
[31:12] that through their own experiences and
[31:16] coming up with something that they can't
[31:20] stand so even I'm thinking if your youth
[31:23] camps you got to be careful on these
[31:25] things you don't know what's being
[31:28] received and how they're receiving
[31:31] it here's another
[31:36] word
[31:37] um been around some people had personal
[31:41] experiences where my Ministries there is
[31:44] called Grace
[31:46] Ministries and I the grace of the Lord
[31:50] is the most precious thing in my life
[31:54] and you been around certain people that
[31:56] make you feel it's like it's a dirty
[31:58] word like you're a compromiser that you
[32:02] have no backbone no stand because they
[32:05] are so steeped in legalism themselves
[32:07] that they can't stand
[32:11] it
[32:13] so here you see something very
[32:18] dangerous and that what God intends and
[32:22] what God sends is not necessarily how it
[32:26] is received in man
[32:30] and because the enemy is
[32:32] there and you will find that in the
[32:35] person's past in their own guilt or in
[32:38] things that maybe they haven't repented
[32:40] of there will be things that will alter
[32:42] what you say and misinterpret what you
[32:46] say and come
[32:48] back and shatter you with
[32:55] it um have a
[33:00] another
[33:05] example the word
[33:09] love Jason and I both know a young
[33:14] man and you mention the word love to him
[33:17] and he will come right out and say don't
[33:19] talk to me don't use that
[33:22] word because when I hear that
[33:26] word the only only thing that comes into
[33:29] my mind and into my heart is a defense
[33:31] mechanism to repulse that's repulsive to
[33:34] me because it means
[33:39] manipulation and
[33:41] power One
[33:44] Direction so can you imagine the word
[33:47] love
[33:48] being altered by the enemy that way so
[33:51] it becomes an offensive
[33:53] word so do you see what I'm saying what
[33:56] has the enemy done
[33:59] and the ministry team here you guys you
[34:03] have to be aware of
[34:06] this and spend so much time in prayer
[34:10] that God can fix
[34:13] this
[34:14] now another
[34:17] word is the word
[34:20] spiritual and you go to the young
[34:24] people even here doesn't make any any
[34:28] difference let's talk about spiritual
[34:30] things and watch them roll their
[34:33] eyes and they'll they'll say well you
[34:36] don't know what I'm facing you don't
[34:38] know what it's like out there you don't
[34:40] know what I've been
[34:43] through and so what is intended to help
[34:49] Satan has put a block in those words
[34:51] and misinterpreted the meaning of those
[34:54] words
[34:56] on so that they're
[35:00] perverted of course the last one
[35:03] now is just the word message okay Jason
[35:07] mention that to 20
[35:10] people in a group out at church cat and
[35:13] see how many answers you get what what
[35:15] does the me what does the word message
[35:17] mean to
[35:18] you
[35:21] um sadly it depends on
[35:25] experiences okay
[35:29] so with a mess like this in the human
[35:34] condition and in the
[35:36] human
[35:37] Spirit now I'm thinking Body Spirit and
[35:43] soul because brother Brenham
[35:46] defines our human
[35:50] Spirit as our reasoning conscience
[35:54] memory affections and uh
[35:59] memory and brother Brams made it very
[36:02] clear that those all are have been
[36:05] filled by
[36:06] Satan so the word of
[36:11] God after the
[36:14] fall was not meant to become and being
[36:18] interpreted by my
[36:21] spirit okay and sadly enough when you
[36:26] preach the word and when you give the
[36:28] word I don't care if you're just
[36:29] testifying to a
[36:32] friend it will go to their
[36:36] spirit before it goes to their soul but
[36:39] God intends it to go to the soul the
[36:41] Eternal part of him to the Eternal part
[36:43] of you and there it's not interpreted
[36:48] there it only can say yes or no to it
[36:52] you with
[36:53] me
[36:55] so going to be very
[36:58] transparent again with myself and
[37:03] uh with all of this experience these
[37:09] words I was living in South
[37:11] Dakota and we had friends in
[37:15] Minnesota where I now
[37:17] live and
[37:19] uh they were I had left
[37:23] church when I left church I never
[37:28] left the
[37:30] message I didn't understand
[37:33] it but I knew it was true and God held
[37:37] me there and so I got my family together
[37:41] and
[37:43] every almost every night we would read
[37:46] scripture together and we'd pray
[37:47] together and
[37:49] we'd no matter if we were out in the
[37:51] woods camping on weekends or Wednesday
[37:53] nights we always stopped and had listen
[37:56] to a message and
[37:58] read scripture and prayed together so
[37:59] that never left me
[38:02] but I had
[38:04] some deep wounds because I was called
[38:07] everything in the book you can imagine
[38:09] after leaving church
[38:12] and so this family who lived in
[38:15] Minnesota said we're having a church
[38:17] camp and uh you have to come and I said
[38:21] no I don't and he'd called me up again
[38:24] and said yeah this is going to be a
[38:26] great church camp you got to come and I
[38:28] said no no no I don't I don't want
[38:32] to and
[38:36] uh after another month he said you're
[38:40] coming I said no I'm not he said you
[38:42] have to
[38:44] come he said uh my H my son has been Lo
[38:49] mowing lawns all summer to pay for
[38:52] your expenses at this Camp so he's paid
[38:55] for you so you got to come and I said
[38:57] thank you very
[39:04] little and begrudgingly I
[39:08] went
[39:17] and I drove into this
[39:20] camp with my
[39:24] family and when I saw
[39:30] a whole group of people sisters in their
[39:33] skirts and their long
[39:37] hair their message
[39:40] men I had a panic
[39:44] attack and it was all I could
[39:48] do I locked the
[39:50] doors I threw the car into reverse and I
[39:53] wanted to step on the gas and just
[39:55] squeal tires running as fast as I could
[39:58] away from that because
[40:02] what should have
[40:05] meant
[40:07] life and
[40:08] freedom in the
[40:11] spirit and
[40:14] growth and the love of the
[40:17] Lord meant everything the
[40:22] opposite and God had to heal me
[40:27] so if any of you are out
[40:29] there and need
[40:31] healing where his words can take effect
[40:35] in you to mean something and bring
[40:39] life instead of
[40:45] death if you can do it for me you can do
[40:48] it for
[40:52] anybody and
[40:54] that's I believe
[41:00] a promise that he's working on for all
[41:03] of us because I still think there's
[41:06] things in each one of
[41:08] us I know he's speaking but I don't know
[41:12] if we're hearing correctly how many
[41:14] things in my
[41:16] life am I filtering through my mind and
[41:19] my own reasoning where he's trying to
[41:22] speak and my mind is so
[41:24] busy that I'm not hearing
[41:28] correctly because the word is life yes
[41:33] Jesus said that my words that I speak
[41:36] unto you they are spirit and their life
[41:38] and if that if something am I hearing a
[41:40] word but nothing's happening in me and I
[41:43] feel dead and I feel like just going
[41:46] through the motions and being a church
[41:50] member I'm dead that are in a rock and
[41:53] don't know
[41:55] it God won't let a son or daughter stay
[42:00] that
[42:01] way CU he'll come after
[42:05] you so brings me to my text
[42:09] tonight if you have your electronic
[42:12] devices because it's probably easier
[42:15] Zephaniah chapter 3 it's been on my
[42:18] heart for a long time so we're going to
[42:20] use that for a text and one other one
[42:22] would just stand with me for just to
[42:24] honor the word
[42:33] now
[42:35] Zephaniah is a minor prophet and he was
[42:37] in the time of Josiah the good King but
[42:40] Israel had been a mess and was a
[42:44] mess well I've been a mess
[42:49] too but
[42:52] here in the midst of messes God brings
[42:55] restoration
[42:57] and love and
[43:00] healing and it's very interesting here
[43:02] how this healing will come so let's
[43:05] start at verse
[43:07] eight therefore wait ye upon me sayith
[43:10] the Lord until the day that I rise to
[43:13] the
[43:13] prey for my determination is to gather
[43:17] the Nations that I might assemble the
[43:18] kingdoms to pour out upon them my
[43:21] indignation what did they do they
[43:22] polluted his
[43:24] kids he loves his kids
[43:28] and he loves
[43:30] you and he doesn't like the world that's
[43:32] polluting our
[43:36] kids so is to pour out my indignation
[43:40] even my Fierce anger for all the Earth
[43:42] shall be devoured with the fire of my
[43:46] jealousy the Lord God is jealous over
[43:50] you he loves you and he wants you in
[43:54] love to be in a love relationship
[43:58] and love him and that jealousy is
[44:03] fierce so verse nine would you read it
[44:07] out loud with me for then I will turn to
[44:10] the people a pure language isn't that
[44:13] interesting yes okay and with this
[44:18] language what's going to happen that
[44:20] they may call upon the name of the Lord
[44:23] to serve him with one consent
[44:27] yes it is and it's going to be it has to
[44:29] be something that happens to us before
[44:31] we're taken out of here because she
[44:34] we're going to be in one Accord and one
[44:37] consent okay so then we go over to verse
[44:41] 14- 16 sing Oh Daughter of Zion shout o
[44:45] Israel be glad and rejoice with all the
[44:47] heart oh daughter of Jerusalem the Lord
[44:50] hath taken away thy
[44:52] judgments he ha cast out thine enemy the
[44:55] king of Israel even the Lord Lord is in
[44:57] the midst of thee Thou shalt not see
[45:00] evil
[45:01] anymore and in that day it shall be said
[45:04] to Jerusalem fear thou not and to Zion
[45:07] let not thine hands be
[45:11] slack the Lord thy God in the midst of
[45:15] the
[45:17] mighty he will save he will rejoice over
[45:21] thee with joy and he will rest in his
[45:25] love he will Joy over with singing
[45:28] that's our
[45:30] God and isn't it interesting that the
[45:33] road to that is through a pure tongue a
[45:37] pure language that he will restore and
[45:41] that's what I was talking
[45:43] about no
[45:45] longer will we hear him according to my
[45:48] thinking or my mind or my reasoning but
[45:51] I will hear what he has to say and what
[45:55] he says is going to have all the power
[45:57] of himself in
[45:59] it to change
[46:02] it Hebrews
[46:08] 12 now Hebrews
[46:11] 12 is constantly going back and
[46:16] comparing what is going on in the
[46:18] spiritual realm with what went on in the
[46:21] children going leaving Israel and going
[46:24] through the
[46:25] Wilderness so
[46:28] he says you're not called to that
[46:30] mountain like Mount siani thank the Lord
[46:34] but we start in verse 20 to what we are
[46:40] called but you are come to Mount
[46:43] Zion we read about that in Zephaniah
[46:46] didn't
[46:50] we and to the city of the Living
[46:53] God and the Heavenly Jerusalem and to a
[46:56] new able company of angels and to a
[47:00] general assembly and Church of the
[47:02] firstborn which are written in heaven
[47:05] question what natural thing is
[47:09] there name one natural thing that we're
[47:12] called
[47:14] to Natural
[47:16] Church natural Pastor natural assembly
[47:20] nothing it's all
[47:23] spiritual Heavenly
[47:25] Jerusalem City of the Living God Church
[47:28] of the firstborn written in
[47:31] where to the god that judge of all and
[47:33] to the spirit look at this the spirits
[47:35] of just men made
[47:39] perfect there's that thing
[47:43] again spirits of just men but God worked
[47:46] on
[47:48] them to cleanse
[47:52] them to Jesus the mediator of a New
[47:55] Covenant and to the blood of sprink that
[47:57] speaks better things than that of Abel
[48:00] see that you refuse not him that
[48:03] speaks for one is speaking and one is
[48:06] speaking in this day and there's coming
[48:08] a time when we will not hear him
[48:10] according to our own thinking and
[48:11] pervert everything but we will hear him
[48:13] what he
[48:14] said and it'll go down deep into our
[48:17] souls and it will have such a lasting
[48:19] effect and such a powerful effect that
[48:21] will change us out of
[48:24] here thank you you may be seated
[48:37] interesting isn't it the journey that he
[48:41] has us on and what he's working with us
[48:44] on now brother Brandon preaches a
[48:48] message it's an early message but it's a
[48:50] wonderful message in it's 1954 God
[48:53] perfecting his church in there he draws
[48:57] a picture he's been talking
[49:00] to uh some people in his church and
[49:02] there was
[49:05] um spiritualist
[49:09] medium in that area and they they were
[49:12] asking questions about this how what
[49:14] Spirits working there in this he draws a
[49:17] picture okay and if I had a Blackboard
[49:20] oldfashioned days I would draw it out
[49:23] but he draws a whole Panorama of
[49:28] um spiritual
[49:30] Dimensions okay because even Jesus
[49:34] talking to the Pharisees and says I am
[49:37] from above you are from beneath so
[49:39] brother Brenham lays this out and in the
[49:41] middle there's this horizontal stripe
[49:44] that goes through here and he says see
[49:46] that this is where Mortals live we right
[49:49] here in between these two dimensions of
[49:51] the lower and the upper and in this
[49:54] Dimension he says it's he calls it a
[49:57] dark mass of gayy yeah you familiar with
[50:00] that brother Jason and he says in this
[50:03] dark mass of gity he says is where
[50:06] Mortals live and that's where we're all
[50:08] at and he says there's not very many but
[50:10] every once in a while you'll see a
[50:12] little light
[50:13] shine it and that's these
[50:20] people that are in the midst of darkness
[50:23] and that's us in this world okay he says
[50:26] but now watch he says it's a here's
[50:30] where mortal lives and he says it's a
[50:32] whole conglomeration of Blackness and
[50:34] darkness and in there is little lights
[50:38] placed now and then you feel outnumbered
[50:41] it's because you are and that's
[50:43] Christians Born Again of light okay born
[50:46] again you are the light that's set on a
[50:49] hill a candle that's set in a room that
[50:51] gives light to all the room that's where
[50:52] the Christian is among
[50:55] Darkness now he says now watch what he
[50:57] says here the
[50:59] wicked or the unbelievers influent from
[51:02] beneath and he says there's a trinity of
[51:05] hell so here's in this mid area where
[51:09] we're all living He says we're all
[51:10] influenced from some other
[51:13] places okay and so you got to be careful
[51:17] and you got to watch your children we're
[51:19] all being
[51:21] influenced right yeah from something
[51:25] somewhere and he said now watch The
[51:28] Wicked or the unbelievers influence from
[51:31] beneath and there's a trinity of hell
[51:33] and there's a trinity of heaven and
[51:36] they're influenced by evil
[51:39] Powers he says the first thing when you
[51:42] start down below that he says is the
[51:46] region of the
[51:48] unsaved and that's the first realm under
[51:51] that and those unsaved for some reason
[51:54] the spirits that in him he says you
[51:56] connect with them because your spirit
[51:57] connects with the
[51:59] spirits interesting isn't it so the
[52:05] spirits are there and they're in
[52:08] reaching up and influencing the in this
[52:10] realm the
[52:11] people and he says the
[52:13] next
[52:15] um let me just read it the first thing
[52:17] when you start down the first thing you
[52:19] find is a realm here that's got the
[52:22] unsaved in it that's right that's where
[52:24] Jesus went and preached to the souls
[52:26] that were in in prison and repented not
[52:27] at the longsuffering of the days of Noah
[52:30] the next is
[52:32] demons and the next is Hell
[52:35] itself the world is influenced by these
[52:38] demon powers through this Trinity and
[52:41] Christians are
[52:42] influenced by a spirit too the Holy
[52:47] Spirit first is the holy
[52:50] spirit above for Christians so above
[52:53] this layer that we're all living in is
[52:56] the whole Holy Spirit the next is Angels
[52:58] Above that and the next finally is God
[53:01] so here we are in the middle of all of
[53:05] these Supernatural forces but we're
[53:08] pretty dull to them aren't we I mean
[53:11] stop and think about
[53:13] it you go through the day you we need to
[53:17] be more aware of these things because
[53:19] when a thought comes to your mind is
[53:21] coming from some
[53:23] Dimension okay and what's you in allow
[53:26] into that Dimension from that Dimension
[53:29] is going to alter how you see the word
[53:32] or another person or what is being
[53:34] preached even why watch that it'll bring
[53:41] judgment and as much as you intend and
[53:44] spend time in prayer and you and me and
[53:47] all the others in the ministry team you
[53:49] can cry and pray and cry and pray and
[53:51] others will go out and watch the enemy
[53:54] work in minds and turn it against what
[53:55] you had in in
[54:00] mind sounds a little fatalistic and I
[54:02] don't mean to because there's a God's
[54:04] bringing a way out of this but sometimes
[54:07] the way out is to see what's there to
[54:09] confront it yeah okay
[54:16] now
[54:19] yeah so with that here we are he makes a
[54:24] strange statement though and I want to
[54:26] read this
[54:30] again he talks about the Christian is
[54:33] among the darkness you're supposed to
[54:36] shine he says the wicked or the
[54:38] unbeliever is influence from
[54:42] beneath okay the world is influenced by
[54:45] these demon powers through the Trinity
[54:47] and
[54:48] Christians are influenced by a spirit
[54:51] too the Holy Spirit now wait a minute
[55:01] what in the world is going on and how do
[55:04] I
[55:06] fight tell me in all
[55:10] honesty if you haven't felt an influence
[55:13] From Hell from
[55:18] demons right or wrong are you human are
[55:21] you in
[55:23] skin then you have
[55:26] but that's not what he says here he says
[55:28] Christians are influenced by the holy
[55:30] spirit it's the unbelievers and the
[55:31] wicked influenced from below so what is
[55:34] going
[55:36] on so here is
[55:41] where the Prophet did so many wonderful
[55:44] things or God did through his prophet in
[55:46] this day
[55:48] yeah you know we have so much to be
[55:51] thankful
[55:54] for because
[55:59] Let's do let's start with the most basic
[56:02] thing baptism in the name of the Lord
[56:06] Jesus how many of us have gone through
[56:09] years and years you got to be
[56:10] re-baptized in the name of the Lord
[56:11] Jesus do you ever explain
[56:13] why do you ever tell people why that's
[56:15] necessary do you ever tell them what is
[56:18] there for
[56:20] them it was so much more than a
[56:24] correction
[56:27] because when he baptized you into a name
[56:31] what is what did brother brandham says
[56:33] what's in your
[56:34] name why do you have to pray about
[56:37] naming your children why is it important
[56:40] why did he change people's
[56:42] names because your
[56:45] name is your character and your
[56:50] nature now think of that so people that
[56:52] are baptized in the name of Trinity
[56:55] father son Holy Ghost they have nothing
[56:58] and Devils travel in that name but here
[56:59] comes the god in this say say I got to
[57:02] get to my children I got to get to them
[57:05] I have to bring them something that
[57:06] they've never had before and the first
[57:09] thing let's show what the scripture said
[57:12] they have to be baptized in the name of
[57:14] Jesus why I want them immersed in my
[57:19] nature in my
[57:22] attributes not just a name correction
[57:26] so when someone is baptized into that
[57:29] and they said do you want the nature of
[57:32] Jesus do you want the attributes do you
[57:34] want the character of Jesus there's no
[57:37] other way you can get it except baptized
[57:40] in that precious name because that
[57:41] precious name carries with it
[57:45] everything so there's these things now
[57:48] that's just one of them and you can go
[57:50] on and on and on and we are so rich we
[57:53] are so blessed with so many things that
[57:56] he has done but one of the
[57:59] things is from this message but I had
[58:03] this with me last year what he
[58:06] [Applause]
[58:08] preached so message knoweth it
[58:12] not and for years and years and years I
[58:16] had
[58:18] it and two years ago the Lord said pick
[58:21] it up and I says I don't need to I know
[58:23] it he says pick it up read it
[58:28] I said yeah I know know it not you are
[58:30] you know blind naked miserable and don't
[58:33] know it it's a Domin Lord I'm out of
[58:36] denominations I don't need this pick it
[58:40] up yes
[58:42] Lord and it became new paragraph by
[58:46] paragraph all new so listen to the
[58:51] spirit even if you think you know
[58:53] everything you
[58:55] don't and even when you think you know
[59:01] everything he'll open more up to you and
[59:04] he just keeps opening up and he just
[59:06] keeps opening up so here is this thing
[59:09] in here and brother brandham is talking
[59:12] about
[59:13] people and he's talking
[59:16] about people that are religious but
[59:18] they're going by their own Human
[59:22] Experience they're interpreting the word
[59:25] through through what they
[59:27] think he uses an example of two women
[59:30] one woman is a a worldly woman she
[59:33] doesn't know anything about the Bible
[59:34] neither does she care about anything
[59:36] about the Bible she doesn't care about
[59:37] what anybody thinks she goes out and she
[59:39] lives with men who cares the other one
[59:42] is a Miss Methodist and she's a lady and
[59:45] she goes to church and she's fine but
[59:48] she still wears her shorts and and goes
[59:51] out and Waters the LA and goes bathing
[59:53] and to the swimming pool and this and
[59:55] that
[59:57] he
[59:59] says it's just
[1:00:03] amazing
[1:00:06] because what she is
[1:00:11] doing is an example of what's going on
[1:00:13] in the world and he says this her own
[1:00:18] thinking her own attitude about the word
[1:00:22] and she's not really hearing God she's
[1:00:23] hearing God through her filters
[1:00:26] thinking man's filter and because of
[1:00:29] listen to
[1:00:33] this it throws the whole world into
[1:00:38] Insanity I want you to think about that
[1:00:41] because this is what I was talking about
[1:00:44] in the beginning when words are
[1:00:47] interpreted by my spirit my reasoning my
[1:00:51] conscience my
[1:00:53] imaginations my affections my
[1:00:57] memories
[1:00:59] okay now I want let me stop there one
[1:01:02] quick because I was waiting I didn't
[1:01:04] understand the memory
[1:01:08] part which of you don't have bad
[1:01:15] memories which of you don't have things
[1:01:18] that you would love that you never come
[1:01:20] to your memory
[1:01:23] again now brother brandham says
[1:01:26] you have to go to these messages start
[1:01:28] out with greatest battle ever fought and
[1:01:30] then you go to things that are uh
[1:01:32] thinking men's filter and then you go to
[1:01:33] this message three of them tie them all
[1:01:35] together listen to them in that order
[1:01:38] and watch what the prophet is saying he
[1:01:40] says Satan has plugged up every one of
[1:01:42] these and they need to be purified and
[1:01:45] plugged and unplugged so that each one
[1:01:46] of these becomes a Channel of the holy
[1:01:49] spirit so my reasoning no longer becomes
[1:01:52] my reasoning it's
[1:01:54] his okay my I is not my conscience it's
[1:01:57] his conscience so what about my
[1:02:02] memory I'll show you as long as you're
[1:02:06] meming bad things here and it causes bad
[1:02:09] influences and thoughts about other
[1:02:11] people because of those bad memories
[1:02:14] it's
[1:02:15] yours because if you had his memory you
[1:02:19] would say where were you when the sons
[1:02:21] of God shouted for joy in the morning
[1:02:23] star sang together yeah there's where
[1:02:26] your memory by the Holy Ghost would take
[1:02:28] you so do you see the cleansing do you
[1:02:32] see where the still there's things in us
[1:02:35] that need to be cleansed out in the our
[1:02:37] mind and we're still hearing the word up
[1:02:40] here and brother Bram talks about these
[1:02:42] two women and he said
[1:02:45] listen it throws the whole world into
[1:02:47] Insanity the whole thing is insane and
[1:02:49] it's so
[1:02:50] gradual gradually kept until the people
[1:02:53] don't even know it now
[1:02:56] is she a prostitute not by her husband
[1:02:59] not by her own body but before God she
[1:03:01] has an evil spirit and she's a
[1:03:04] prostitute he says because she
[1:03:08] thinks because she
[1:03:11] thinks did you hear what I said because
[1:03:14] she
[1:03:16] thinks you interpret the word of God by
[1:03:19] what you said what did I start out with
[1:03:21] what do people do with the word the word
[1:03:23] what they do with the word Grace what
[1:03:25] they do with the word love what they do
[1:03:26] with the word spiritual it's interpreted
[1:03:29] by their experiences right so are they
[1:03:33] hearing and can they hear the the voice
[1:03:36] of God and what he really is trying to
[1:03:38] get across to them until that's cleaned
[1:03:40] out
[1:03:44] wow
[1:03:47] so here she
[1:03:49] is and this kind of thing that is going
[1:03:52] on in her and she is just an example of
[1:03:55] what is going on the in the world and he
[1:03:57] says that's why the world is going
[1:04:01] insane think of that it's her Insanity
[1:04:05] now
[1:04:08] here he gives you
[1:04:10] help be the prophet the Holy Spirit
[1:04:14] comes through the prophet and says I'm
[1:04:16] going to help you out because I'm going
[1:04:18] to identify things for you that you
[1:04:21] don't have to be that way anymore
[1:04:26] you can rise above it and you can have
[1:04:28] all of those channels become channels of
[1:04:30] the Holy Spirit every single one of them
[1:04:33] your affections the affections of the
[1:04:35] Holy
[1:04:36] Spirit nothing
[1:04:39] else your
[1:04:42] memories where you are in
[1:04:45] Christ
[1:04:47] okay so he talks about the Body Soul and
[1:04:50] Spirit you I'm sure you're all familiar
[1:04:53] familiar with this but he talks about
[1:04:55] the outside is the
[1:04:57] Flesh and he says that's the evil one
[1:05:00] okay and I'm sure you're familiar with
[1:05:02] this but he says the spirit in is inside
[1:05:05] that that's your five
[1:05:09] things okay he says that's of a worldly
[1:05:15] nature
[1:05:17] well does that reflect God
[1:05:21] then so here's what he says the it's a
[1:05:24] that spirit is of worldly nature because
[1:05:27] it's not given from
[1:05:30] God but it's permitted by
[1:05:33] him okay so your
[1:05:36] soul the last man is the
[1:05:40] soul there's only one
[1:05:43] sense when it comes to the word of God
[1:05:45] and that's say Amen or not to the word
[1:05:48] of God we know that so here is brother
[1:05:51] brandom here is
[1:05:53] 1937 here he's going through through
[1:05:57] the pain and Agony of losing his wife
[1:06:01] and losing his daughter and losing his
[1:06:03] father all at the same
[1:06:04] time and he goes through all of that and
[1:06:08] he talks about what Satan was doing in
[1:06:10] his
[1:06:11] head and he said but what did it
[1:06:16] do it the Holy Spirit was working from
[1:06:21] the outside to that first man
[1:06:26] what is he saying he's saying you know
[1:06:28] what I was controlled by my reasoning
[1:06:32] because I listened to the voice of
[1:06:34] my
[1:06:37] mother-in-law don't go to those people
[1:06:39] you're not going to take my daughter
[1:06:41] there well maybe I shouldn't well maybe
[1:06:45] reasoning what did he say is going to
[1:06:47] throw the whole world into Insanity that
[1:06:50] yeah right okay so brother what God is
[1:06:54] saying you know prophet you're my
[1:06:57] man but in 1937 God would not let him
[1:07:00] continue on in his ministry until he
[1:07:02] quit that and he passed that and he said
[1:07:05] no you have to come to a point where
[1:07:07] you're controlled by only soul and
[1:07:11] nothing of the spirit unless that spirit
[1:07:13] is cleansed out and become absolute
[1:07:14] channels of the Holy Ghost
[1:07:18] right so why do you think you're
[1:07:22] different why do I think I'm different
[1:07:25] I'm not
[1:07:26] he's the first one to come to maturity
[1:07:28] so something has to happen
[1:07:33] now so what he has done in favor for me
[1:07:37] he has identified what is the real
[1:07:42] me so gonna ask you guys
[1:07:46] questions you're Chris I never met you
[1:07:49] God bless
[1:07:50] you okay do you have an old nature do
[1:07:54] you have an old man
[1:07:57] we all do sure does that guy drive you
[1:08:05] crazy so is
[1:08:07] mine and don't you okay Micah don't you
[1:08:11] think he's supposed to be dead
[1:08:13] right I thought I buried him about a
[1:08:15] million times now haven't you and why
[1:08:19] does he keep
[1:08:21] resurrecting here's what brother Brenham
[1:08:23] has done for each one of us
[1:08:26] in this
[1:08:28] message when he defines the spirit and
[1:08:31] he says that's not part of God it's not
[1:08:34] from him it's a worldly nature he just
[1:08:36] gave it to you because something needs
[1:08:38] to be worked out in
[1:08:40] me that's not the real you thank God mhm
[1:08:45] so if you go look
[1:08:50] through the
[1:08:52] quotes and if I look up the words
[1:08:56] Soul okay and I have lots of quotes on
[1:08:59] them but the real you is that true right
[1:09:02] brother Jason right brother
[1:09:04] Jason he he just I never know of any
[1:09:07] place where he looks at the human spirit
[1:09:09] and says that's you no way okay so he
[1:09:12] says I need you to change your
[1:09:15] identification to what the real you is
[1:09:18] you now okay brother
[1:09:21] Andrew have you've had trouble in your
[1:09:23] life because you're a human being cuz
[1:09:26] you're in skin and your old man drives
[1:09:28] you crazy let me ask you this has have
[1:09:31] you ever had any trouble saying Amen to
[1:09:33] the word of God never why because
[1:09:37] there's a soul inside and that Soul can
[1:09:39] only do one thing
[1:09:42] Hallelujah Chris you've had a lot of
[1:09:44] trouble in your life right but some hard
[1:09:47] down deep in the anchor of your soul it
[1:09:49] has always said yes to that right that's
[1:09:53] the real you and that is a
[1:09:56] now why is the trouble go to Romans
[1:09:59] chapter 6 and I just here is where so
[1:10:05] much needs to take place even in us here
[1:10:10] we know this these are so common to
[1:10:15] us Romans
[1:10:17] 6 okay what do we know verse three know
[1:10:21] you not that so many US of were baptized
[1:10:23] were um as we're baptized into Jesus
[1:10:26] Christ we're baptized into his death
[1:10:28] what did Brother Bram teach us when
[1:10:31] Jesus
[1:10:32] died you were there didn't you die what
[1:10:38] died read verse five have we have been
[1:10:41] planted together in the likeness of his
[1:10:43] death we shall all be in the likeness of
[1:10:45] his res Resurrection knowing this that
[1:10:48] our old man is crucified with
[1:10:51] him right right now you all have
[1:10:54] confessed tonight
[1:10:59] unbelief you all say my old man's
[1:11:01] driving me crazy no he
[1:11:04] isn't you all said he's alive and well
[1:11:07] he's Mak he drives me
[1:11:10] crazy you just denied the word of
[1:11:13] God do you see what's happening you were
[1:11:16] using
[1:11:18] this you were using the very thing that
[1:11:21] the word of God was not sent to it was
[1:11:23] sent to your soul that says amen
[1:11:26] and because it went to my brain it went
[1:11:28] to my brain says oh I'm having trouble
[1:11:31] therefore no what is true is that word
[1:11:35] of God in Romans is that true or not
[1:11:37] true true is that more true than you are
[1:11:40] true is that more true than your
[1:11:43] experience is true then who's the
[1:11:48] liar than Rel
[1:11:51] liing then that shows us that we're so
[1:11:54] much there's things in our bodies things
[1:11:57] in our minds things in us that's going
[1:11:59] on that are still like these people were
[1:12:03] with the word just different we're still
[1:12:06] having
[1:12:07] problems the word is being interpretated
[1:12:09] by somebody else's
[1:12:11] control love is being interpret
[1:12:15] interpreted as uh
[1:12:18] manipulation for personal gain
[1:12:22] right that's not love that's not the
[1:12:24] word
[1:12:26] but we let our experience so what's the
[1:12:28] difference between them doing that and
[1:12:30] us doing
[1:12:32] this because if my old man is dead
[1:12:35] because the Bible said it's dead then
[1:12:37] it's dead period so what's going
[1:12:42] on greatest battle ever fought it's not
[1:12:45] you it's not your old man because he's
[1:12:46] crucified but the old man this enemy
[1:12:49] comes into your mind and raises these
[1:12:51] things up and said oh that's me and as
[1:12:54] long as you can believe that enemy of
[1:12:55] what he's saying that's you he's got
[1:12:59] you and you've got to get him beyond the
[1:13:01] point because say he doesn't have me
[1:13:04] because that's not me because my old man
[1:13:07] is dead because it Jesus it was
[1:13:09] crucified in my
[1:13:11] Jesus and because of him I am set free
[1:13:14] from that because there you have to go
[1:13:15] to verse 11 read it out loud with me
[1:13:18] what does it say
[1:13:20] likewise reckon ye also why do you have
[1:13:24] to reckon if it's dead because there's a
[1:13:27] mental gymnastics and mental game and
[1:13:29] mental spiritual warfare going on saying
[1:13:33] it's not dead when it
[1:13:35] is you have to reckon it dead you go
[1:13:39] back to the enemy and you every morning
[1:13:41] when you wake up that old man's dead he
[1:13:44] comes and speak to you no that's not me
[1:13:46] my old man is dead so Satan give leave
[1:13:48] me alone because in my soul rejoices in
[1:13:51] God my savior
[1:13:55] amen so
[1:13:58] here what is just happening
[1:14:02] there Zephaniah chapter 3 I am going to
[1:14:06] restore to you a pure
[1:14:09] word that you can all be in harmony with
[1:14:12] each other and with me because you're
[1:14:15] going to get my
[1:14:17] thoughts isn't that
[1:14:19] beautiful isn't that a wonderful thing
[1:14:21] to hang on to okay now
[1:14:27] what time did I come up here am I over
[1:14:30] time you not can I read some quotes
[1:14:33] because oh this is so
[1:14:36] exciting okay I was going to read some
[1:14:39] more do you do you understand what I was
[1:14:40] getting brother brandham came dig out
[1:14:43] this message your true identification is
[1:14:46] given to you by your God saying that
[1:14:51] isn't
[1:14:52] you go read every quote you can on the
[1:14:55] the soul the real you the real you is
[1:14:58] that Eternal part that a part of God
[1:15:00] that's the real you the one that says
[1:15:02] amen and I can have all kinds of
[1:15:05] troubles down here and all kinds of
[1:15:07] things that drive me crazy and
[1:15:08] situations drive me crazy and people
[1:15:10] drive me crazy sometimes but it's mostly
[1:15:15] it's just the
[1:15:16] enemy and you got to learn to fight what
[1:15:18] you're supposed to fight because if
[1:15:20] you're fighting the wrong thing you're
[1:15:21] missing you're not going to
[1:15:23] win and that's what Satan would love to
[1:15:25] do for each one of us you're fighting
[1:15:27] the wrong
[1:15:28] thing oh Don's fighting the wrong battle
[1:15:31] and I'm out here his real enemy and he's
[1:15:32] not even fighting
[1:15:34] me
[1:15:37] true scary isn't
[1:15:39] it he's a
[1:15:42] deceiver okay so with all of this are
[1:15:45] you with me so far what we're wanting
[1:15:49] what we've seen so far is the mystery of
[1:15:53] words words words were sent by
[1:15:58] God to do something to help to edify to
[1:16:03] build me up into
[1:16:06] him okay to make me
[1:16:11] him to have that power of him in
[1:16:15] me and if I'm just going and listening
[1:16:18] to sermons and I go out and I even
[1:16:19] forget what he what was spoken and oh he
[1:16:23] sure was longwinded today and oh my
[1:16:25] goodness you
[1:16:27] know and
[1:16:30] oh I'm sorry but I get pretty hard even
[1:16:34] with my people at
[1:16:37] home I walk out of church if I would see
[1:16:41] people talking about the word after
[1:16:43] church I would die and go to
[1:16:50] heaven do you know what I've been done
[1:16:52] I've been very mean
[1:16:55] you leave here and you leave a church
[1:16:57] and you go out and say now let's get on
[1:16:59] with what we really like what's at the
[1:17:05] game who's playing
[1:17:11] what oh
[1:17:14] really I would love to see people get as
[1:17:17] excited about
[1:17:19] Jesus and my heart cries and my heart
[1:17:23] breaks
[1:17:25] because I see him much more excited
[1:17:27] about music and sports and everything
[1:17:30] else more than
[1:17:34] Jesus so what's going
[1:17:38] on brother Jason there's Warfare upon
[1:17:41] Warfare upon Warfare upon
[1:17:44] Warfare but we're not going to stay that
[1:17:46] way because we're
[1:17:50] Overcomers okay
[1:17:57] here's brother Bram again and he makes
[1:18:00] some very very strange strange
[1:18:03] statements on why he believes the word
[1:18:05] and in here he's going to open us
[1:18:08] something there's a channel for us
[1:18:11] waiting to enter
[1:18:14] into that brings us out of this
[1:18:19] realm because this realm is death
[1:18:26] this realm is a dark mass of
[1:18:33] gity mostly we surrounded by
[1:18:37] death
[1:18:39] true
[1:18:42] yeah but one of the words I
[1:18:45] mentioned that people have a hard
[1:18:48] time is the word
[1:18:50] spiritual how many
[1:18:53] times oh you think you're so spiritual
[1:18:57] you heard that
[1:19:01] before
[1:19:04] yeah if they only
[1:19:07] knew what God was trying to help them
[1:19:13] with this
[1:19:17] realm I've identified some things
[1:19:19] through scripture but this realm this
[1:19:21] Physical Realm
[1:19:25] is for
[1:19:29] assaults and trials and
[1:19:35] pain his realm look at all the men of
[1:19:38] God come on just go through the Bible
[1:19:41] just do a mental inventory real quick
[1:19:43] think of any man in this realm that
[1:19:45] wasn't assaulted and by everything and
[1:19:50] everybody okay and wasn't going through
[1:19:53] pain and wasn't going through trial
[1:19:56] his realm where the Lord's trying to
[1:19:58] bring us up to his realm the realm in
[1:20:01] the spirit the realm in the Holy Ghost
[1:20:03] is for
[1:20:05] Revelation and love and
[1:20:10] identification
[1:20:11] okay and all through the messages
[1:20:15] especially 63 on you hear the call of
[1:20:18] the Holy Spirit come up higher come up
[1:20:21] higher how many times do you hear this
[1:20:22] brother brandham tell the story
[1:20:25] of the mama Eagle calling for her baby
[1:20:29] and do you notice what he
[1:20:31] said about that Mama Eagle he doesn't go
[1:20:34] down and pick her
[1:20:36] up no she says I'm up here you
[1:20:39] come you come up here yeah because
[1:20:43] number one this is where you belong and
[1:20:45] I don't belong down there but you belong
[1:20:47] up here I can't come and get you but you
[1:20:50] can come to
[1:20:52] me and this is where the spirit keeps
[1:20:55] calling calling calling calling and it's
[1:20:59] the things of this life and your own
[1:21:01] reasonings that bring you down and keep
[1:21:03] you in this realm and he doesn't want
[1:21:05] you to stay here
[1:21:09] right someday you're going to face
[1:21:12] it and all the things that you love
[1:21:15] about this
[1:21:16] realm have to
[1:21:19] disappear you want out of
[1:21:23] here okay I want speak to you on an
[1:21:25] unusual subject but sometimes you find
[1:21:27] God in unusual things he does things in
[1:21:31] unusual
[1:21:32] ways not the usual way it's the unusual
[1:21:35] way unusual times unusual sensus he's
[1:21:40] unusual okay I want to speak on the
[1:21:44] subject why it why it had to be
[1:21:46] Shepherds this is
[1:21:47] 1964 the end of the
[1:21:51] year um then he goes on
[1:21:55] as I said last week in Phoenix it's
[1:21:57] proven that there are subjects of this
[1:21:59] Earth people passing through this
[1:22:01] building television proves that it's
[1:22:03] another dimension our naturalizing our
[1:22:06] five senses cannot pick it up it isn't
[1:22:08] that television manufactures anything
[1:22:10] it's only channels you cannot make a
[1:22:12] move of your finger or batch your eye
[1:22:15] but it's proven to be recorded
[1:22:18] forever
[1:22:21] okay I might be standing in Australia or
[1:22:24] television screen here not only that but
[1:22:26] the man can speak move his finger bat
[1:22:28] his eye even the color of the clothing
[1:22:29] that he's wearing will be be projected
[1:22:33] here on the wall and he in Africa
[1:22:35] Australia around the world there's a
[1:22:37] cycle of ether waves I cannot explain it
[1:22:41] but I know it's there I don't know
[1:22:42] anyone who could really explain it so
[1:22:45] television can pull this in and make it
[1:22:47] a reality by some instruments that they
[1:22:50] could reflect it on the wall and that
[1:22:53] same thing was there when Adam was here
[1:22:55] television when here was when Elijah sat
[1:22:58] on Mount Caramel it was here when Martin
[1:23:00] Luther the young priest throw the
[1:23:02] communion on the floor called it
[1:23:04] kosher and he said the just shall live
[1:23:07] by faith it was there then we are just
[1:23:09] fine now finding it it's also in our
[1:23:14] presence tonight as God angel
[1:23:16] supernatural being that's unseen to the
[1:23:18] Natural sense of light but someday it'll
[1:23:20] be a listen to that please someday it'll
[1:23:24] be a reality
[1:23:26] wow just as television is now and just
[1:23:28] as common now here it is
[1:23:33] odd now that's why I believe the
[1:23:37] word isn't that odd I mean can you
[1:23:41] believe it
[1:23:42] Jason would you ever get up before the
[1:23:45] people and said I television is why I
[1:23:47] believe the
[1:23:51] word but he did
[1:23:55] so what is he telling us what is going
[1:23:57] on what in the world is he seeing that
[1:24:00] he sees this is because when he sees the
[1:24:03] word he sees something
[1:24:07] that I hate to use this word but I don't
[1:24:10] know of another word a
[1:24:13] portal into an whole another dimension
[1:24:16] and a whole another realm that is there
[1:24:19] and when I the word is supposed to be
[1:24:22] that way that it opens me up to God and
[1:24:25] to angels and opens me up to Heavenly
[1:24:27] things going on in Heavenly places
[1:24:30] instead of just something that I
[1:24:31] memorize and is ink on a paper and I
[1:24:34] take it home and it has no effect on
[1:24:39] me see the
[1:24:43] difference because it's those kinds of
[1:24:45] effects that make people say don't talk
[1:24:48] to me about the word don't talk to me
[1:24:50] about love oh you think you're so
[1:24:52] spiritual because they're Minds have
[1:24:56] interpreted those words through their
[1:24:58] own experiences and corrupted the
[1:25:00] meaning of all of
[1:25:03] them so God has to come with a prophecy
[1:25:06] and said I'm going to return to you my
[1:25:08] language a pure language and I'm going
[1:25:12] to give you a word that you can
[1:25:16] hear not through your thinking but from
[1:25:22] me from me
[1:25:25] so we see that it's not television
[1:25:27] itself but the scientific medium that
[1:25:29] proves that there is an internal
[1:25:31] Dimension that is forever recorded and
[1:25:34] can listen to this can be tapped
[1:25:38] into here's where we're
[1:25:43] going
[1:25:46] 1951 message at Thy
[1:25:48] word now and here his written word bring
[1:25:52] forth of its kind if you'll just
[1:25:56] in his written word he
[1:25:59] says bring there's Blank Spot bring
[1:26:02] forth of its kind if you'll just receive
[1:26:04] it in your heart and believe it you
[1:26:07] might read the word and be such listen
[1:26:09] to this be such a scholar there we go
[1:26:12] here if there's anything that's going to
[1:26:15] destroy the world the word that's
[1:26:18] it your own
[1:26:23] thinking in might be a SC scholar till
[1:26:25] you know the ins and outs of the word
[1:26:27] but that will never do no
[1:26:30] no it will do no good until it becomes
[1:26:33] quickened to
[1:26:34] you and if you only knew one word and
[1:26:38] it's quickened then that's what you need
[1:26:42] just one word
[1:26:46] quickened now I want to give an
[1:26:48] illustration he says so that the
[1:26:51] children children can understand
[1:26:55] let's take him speaking 2,000 years ago
[1:26:58] so imagine right now Jesus maybe Sermon
[1:27:01] on the Mount
[1:27:03] whatever let's take him illustration so
[1:27:07] the children can
[1:27:09] understand let him speaking 2,000 years
[1:27:12] ago them words are floating in the air
[1:27:15] okay and if I would raise up this Bible
[1:27:19] and they would hit against the side of
[1:27:21] this Bible and I would turn around and
[1:27:23] if you can tune down some kind of an
[1:27:27] instrument that would pick up his words
[1:27:29] that he spoke literally you could hear
[1:27:30] it coming through the television set or
[1:27:34] something or 2,000 years ago when he was
[1:27:37] there it would be just like it is
[1:27:41] here
[1:27:42] now what's he trying to get me to see
[1:27:47] let's go
[1:27:49] on the word is a living present tense
[1:27:52] word so same as in Genesis it is God
[1:27:56] purposed it's God's power to accomplish
[1:27:59] that for which it was
[1:28:01] set
[1:28:06] okay this is from the message Fellowship
[1:28:11] 1955 then I think that whenever this
[1:28:14] Soul leaves the body we can go into
[1:28:15] another house not made with hands we go
[1:28:18] into the presence of God and their
[1:28:21] Tabernacle with him in the presence of
[1:28:23] the Lord Jesus
[1:28:26] I'm in all om he's all
[1:28:30] omnipresent and if he then if he
[1:28:34] is we are then when we go into a new
[1:28:36] Tabernacle over here wherever two or
[1:28:38] more are gathered and I'll be in the
[1:28:40] midst he's bound to be here this
[1:28:43] afternoon just as sure as there's a
[1:28:46] heaven and an earth Jesus is present
[1:28:49] now but what if he's in an unseen
[1:28:53] condition we can't see him but there's
[1:28:55] something about the Christian
[1:28:58] soul that when a man realizes he's in
[1:29:01] the presence of God is standing in the
[1:29:03] presence of something that he can't see
[1:29:05] we know there's a radio going through
[1:29:07] here now there's television going
[1:29:09] through here our eyes can't pick it up
[1:29:10] because it's another world and so the
[1:29:13] angels of God go around this room
[1:29:15] watching this place and the angels of
[1:29:18] God are encamped around those that fear
[1:29:20] Him Jesus is all present all the time
[1:29:22] watching over us I know that to be the
[1:29:27] truth I think of when Elijah down here
[1:29:29] in Dothan when the gesi went out and
[1:29:32] looked over and oh there's a whole
[1:29:33] Syrian Army look at them they've done
[1:29:35] got the city compassed about and we're
[1:29:37] surrounded and he said God open this
[1:29:40] boy's eyes right and he saw angels of
[1:29:44] fire when the Christian Believers can
[1:29:47] believe that present now right now
[1:29:50] sitting here sitting here in Heavenly
[1:29:53] places in Christ Jesus in Christ Jesus
[1:29:57] fellowshipping around the word of God
[1:29:58] the holy spirit is here taking the word
[1:30:01] of God by Vision listen to this moving
[1:30:05] it out into every heart like that as the
[1:30:09] word is going forth and every believer
[1:30:11] is receiving it this is where the Holy
[1:30:15] Spirit has to take
[1:30:19] us where we
[1:30:22] here not only what he says but what he
[1:30:28] means and the me thought behind the
[1:30:31] words so we don't have to interpret
[1:30:33] according to my experience and pervert
[1:30:41] everything
[1:30:43] 1963 flashing red light of his
[1:30:48] coming I remember if there was a
[1:30:51] microphone sitting right here where this
[1:30:53] is and I was brought casting down to the
[1:30:54] world and the people around the world
[1:30:56] would hear my voice before it even got
[1:30:59] across this Pulpit to you that's
[1:31:02] electronics and you know that voice
[1:31:04] Never
[1:31:05] Dies it'll never die science in 20 years
[1:31:10] if they can pro pro progress as they
[1:31:13] have now they'll pick it up the literal
[1:31:16] voice of Jesus Christ when he was on
[1:31:18] Earth in 20 years from
[1:31:22] now because it's like dropping a pebble
[1:31:24] on a
[1:31:25] pond the little
[1:31:28] waves may may finally fade out of your
[1:31:32] sight but science claims they'll go back
[1:31:34] to One bank across the ocean to another
[1:31:36] and back and forth they will never
[1:31:39] die and neither does the word that you
[1:31:42] speak it'll meet you on the day of
[1:31:44] judgment and will condemn you or save
[1:31:46] you and you'll never be able to get away
[1:31:48] from any of
[1:31:49] it and we are conscious it's coming
[1:31:52] right through this room right now now is
[1:31:54] pictures of people if you don't believe
[1:31:55] it turn on your
[1:31:57] television and there's
[1:31:59] voices of people yet your senses won't
[1:32:03] pick them up now they've got a sending
[1:32:06] station and a magnetic pole and a tube
[1:32:09] and a crystal that picks up those voices
[1:32:11] and reproduces them and now the only
[1:32:15] thing the Bible is is this the word of
[1:32:18] Jesus Christ that he spoke they are
[1:32:20] listen to me they're literally a lie
[1:32:24] just like any other word in this world
[1:32:27] tonight
[1:32:30] listen if your heart has been
[1:32:34] cleansed by the blood of Jesus
[1:32:38] Christ and becomes a receiving
[1:32:41] set from the sending
[1:32:44] set he's the same yesterday today and
[1:32:48] forever listen he does the same thing he
[1:32:52] did cuz his words can't die
[1:32:54] they're living forever more listen
[1:32:56] please you don't have to wait 20 years
[1:33:00] you can receive it right now do you know
[1:33:03] what he's
[1:33:05] saying
[1:33:06] listen God spoke you know you know it
[1:33:10] sound waves
[1:33:13] right Satan came in
[1:33:16] there with
[1:33:18] Eve and broke put a little slice in
[1:33:21] there and disrupted the whole life of
[1:33:25] it something had to come along in this
[1:33:28] day Zephaniah 3 something had to be
[1:33:31] restored the word had to be restored
[1:33:34] spoken word is the Original Seed it had
[1:33:36] to come a point where somebody would
[1:33:38] receive it the way it was
[1:33:40] meant not through a man's
[1:33:43] thinking not through somebody's
[1:33:46] interpretation of what it meant but what
[1:33:49] God
[1:33:50] meant and that happened again this day
[1:33:53] and brother bre is saying if my heart is
[1:33:55] blood if my heart is cleansed by the
[1:33:58] blood of Jesus right now I can get into
[1:34:02] that realm with my God by the Holy Ghost
[1:34:05] and I can literally get into that hear
[1:34:09] those that actual voice of
[1:34:12] God when you get into the actual voice
[1:34:17] of God the very voice of
[1:34:21] God in the beginning and Genesis Let
[1:34:24] There
[1:34:26] Be was in those sound
[1:34:30] waves huh what was it those sound waves
[1:34:33] that when those sound waves carried the
[1:34:37] life of God those sound waves carried
[1:34:40] the power of God those sound waves
[1:34:43] carried the nature of God and all of a
[1:34:45] sudden because of what was in those
[1:34:47] sound
[1:34:49] waves universes
[1:34:55] than Earth than
[1:34:58] whales that's the power that's there and
[1:35:01] that's that creative power of God that
[1:35:03] says do I'm not going to leave you like
[1:35:06] you are because I saw you before the
[1:35:08] foundation of the world and you're going
[1:35:09] to enter into that voice and you're
[1:35:11] going to become
[1:35:13] me and that's where it is and that's how
[1:35:16] we have to get in there to
[1:35:19] enter apart from our
[1:35:21] thinking if brother random had to be
[1:35:24] moved to the first man so the soul was
[1:35:26] in control so do I and so do you and if
[1:35:30] using my thinking and I'm a human using
[1:35:33] his thinking is throwing the whole world
[1:35:35] into insanity and is making that
[1:35:37] religious woman a prostitute in the eyes
[1:35:39] of God tell
[1:35:41] me my thinking isn't doing the same
[1:35:46] W tell me there doesn't doesn't have to
[1:35:49] be some kind of cleansing with this and
[1:35:51] now he's telling me now I don't have to
[1:35:53] wait till 20 years this is
[1:35:57] 1963 now I don't have to wait now
[1:35:59] there's something inside of me God has
[1:36:01] made a way that I can go by the spirit
[1:36:05] of God and I can put on those tapes I
[1:36:07] can go into my Bible and he transports
[1:36:10] me up yeah into that place where the
[1:36:13] holy spirit is speaking and all of a
[1:36:15] sudden the power of God comes in me oh
[1:36:18] there's changing power real oh I don't
[1:36:21] have to be the sinner anymore oh I don't
[1:36:23] have to be down in this realm anymore oh
[1:36:26] I don't have to feel this pain and this
[1:36:27] hurt of Trials no he's transported me up
[1:36:30] where there's glory and Revelation and
[1:36:33] identification that says you're my son
[1:36:36] yeah you forgot you had spiritual
[1:36:39] Amnesia and you forgot who you were but
[1:36:41] now you weren't meant to be there you
[1:36:44] were meant to be up here with me you
[1:36:47] belong up flying you belong up in these
[1:36:49] Realms you belong here and let all of a
[1:36:51] sudden you can hear my voice and all the
[1:36:54] power that it is and that's transforming
[1:36:59] power this
[1:37:01] is what a change huh do you want to live
[1:37:08] forever in
[1:37:11] words that have no meaning or no power
[1:37:14] behind
[1:37:15] them do you want to live in words that
[1:37:18] are
[1:37:20] perverted that lost all of their meaning
[1:37:22] that what God Said send them to because
[1:37:24] of people's experiences and
[1:37:26] Minds something has to transport us
[1:37:29] above all
[1:37:31] this into the wonderful power of
[1:37:35] God last
[1:37:38] quote
[1:37:42] 1965 Paradox
[1:37:47] message he says Lord me let me be only
[1:37:51] conscious of one thing
[1:37:53] your presence here with
[1:37:57] us he says Lord Jesus you are a paradox
[1:38:01] thou are a par Paradox when God was made
[1:38:05] flesh I pray heavenly father that you
[1:38:06] will manifest yourself this afternoon
[1:38:09] proving to us here
[1:38:11] today not only proving to us there is I
[1:38:14] suppose 90% or more of the people that
[1:38:16] believe every word but that we might see
[1:38:19] you again
[1:38:23] there's a difference there I believe
[1:38:26] every word and seeing him because
[1:38:28] there's a connection there's a place in
[1:38:30] the spirit you travel
[1:38:32] to
[1:38:37] right and let know that that
[1:38:40] word that you spoke is still traveling
[1:38:44] around the world and around and around
[1:38:46] the world just like a
[1:38:49] record let us move into that record
[1:38:52] today
[1:38:54] let us move
[1:38:56] in so he's telling you I can do
[1:39:00] this okay I'm not putting something AB
[1:39:04] above you that you can't go
[1:39:07] into the spirit of God is making us a
[1:39:10] way to do things we've never done
[1:39:13] before and what these things are
[1:39:16] necessary to
[1:39:18] us right
[1:39:23] let me start again I'm
[1:39:26] sorry and let know that this word that
[1:39:28] you spake that's still traveling around
[1:39:30] and around the world just like a record
[1:39:34] let us move into that record today Lord
[1:39:38] let us move and not hear it just like it
[1:39:41] was coming secondly from a man's
[1:39:44] mouth what's that telling
[1:39:47] me I have to go beyond the
[1:39:50] prophet I have to go
[1:39:54] past the
[1:39:56] man past the vehicle he's
[1:39:59] using and something in my soul is
[1:40:02] reaching up into the very heart and soul
[1:40:05] of God past the
[1:40:07] vessels okay
[1:40:11] yeah okay now brother Brenham warned the
[1:40:16] people okay unveiling of
[1:40:20] God there was a time when it was death
[1:40:23] to go through that Veil now it's death
[1:40:25] not
[1:40:27] to and most people are still caught in
[1:40:29] the
[1:40:30] veil that reveals
[1:40:34] him but we have to go beyond that let
[1:40:38] them hear not like it was secondly from
[1:40:41] a man's mouth but let that mouth and
[1:40:43] that person and that people become your
[1:40:46] word they have tapped in to the voice
[1:40:51] and those sound waves that God God spoke
[1:40:53] before the foundation of the world that
[1:40:56] carries all of the power of God and all
[1:41:01] the nature of God and all the character
[1:41:04] of God and that creative power that
[1:41:07] spoke worlds into existence is now
[1:41:10] speaking sons of God into
[1:41:14] manifestation let's
[1:41:21] pray Lord
[1:41:25] here we
[1:41:27] are and you've laid things out so
[1:41:29] beautifully for
[1:41:32] us and we need a cleansing from our
[1:41:35] human spirit and our minds and our own
[1:41:37] thinking and we need
[1:41:41] you so that we can hear you Lord not
[1:41:44] through our thinking or what we want or
[1:41:47] what we agree
[1:41:51] with or what we like
[1:41:55] but hear and be corrected
[1:41:58] and hear things with power that we've
[1:42:01] never experienced
[1:42:04] before because your word will not return
[1:42:07] unto you void it will accomplish that
[1:42:09] for which you sent
[1:42:11] it
[1:42:13] Lord we offer ourselves up to you help
[1:42:16] us
[1:42:19] Lord thank you for giving us an
[1:42:21] identification of who we really are
[1:42:23] we're
[1:42:25] Sons not we will be we
[1:42:29] are but you've given us the
[1:42:32] power to live as
[1:42:35] Sons to shine forth in this world as
[1:42:41] [Music]
[1:42:42] Sons to express you to the world as
[1:42:47] Sons oh God let there not be anything in
[1:42:51] us that would project anybody around
[1:42:53] around us that we love this realm more
[1:42:56] than your
[1:42:58] realm that we are more happy with things
[1:43:01] down here than we are happy with things
[1:43:04] above oh God forgive
[1:43:06] [Music]
[1:43:09] us oh have mercy on us
[1:43:14] Lord let it be that you and you alone
[1:43:18] are the joy and rejoicing of our
[1:43:21] heart we don't need
[1:43:24] entertainment we don't need the things
[1:43:26] that the world needs because you've raid
[1:43:28] us up and made us to sit in Heavenly
[1:43:32] places in Christ
[1:43:33] Jesus there's no Greater
[1:43:38] Joy No Greater
[1:43:40] thrill no greater
[1:43:44] desire than
[1:43:46] that oh bring us to a place where we can
[1:43:49] hear you and where your word will be
[1:43:52] totally heavy it's effect on us father

[1:44:17] heart let it live in
[1:44:20] me let it stop
[1:44:25] live inside this house of
[1:44:29] clay and it every
[1:44:34] day let your word be
[1:44:38] born in the
[1:44:41] manger
[1:44:42] of my
[1:44:44] heart oh let your your

[1:45:13] day let your word be
[1:45:16] born in the
[1:45:19] manger of my heart
[1:45:25] aren't you glad for a cleansing power
[1:45:29] am
[1:45:30] my that was so much to chew on Brother
[1:45:33] Don I'm going to May I've already
[1:45:35] purposed in my mind I've got markers
[1:45:37] where I want to go back and hear exactly
[1:45:40] how you made some of those those points
[1:45:42] again right there near the
[1:45:45] end in summing
[1:45:51] up if
[1:45:53] as as he was saying
[1:45:56] if if there's an
[1:46:00] ability for the God of this evil age and
[1:46:03] I'm just putting it in my words to take
[1:46:06] a woman who was not actually insane but
[1:46:11] actually make her act insane brother Ram
[1:46:13] said they take their clothes off that's
[1:46:14] like Legion that's
[1:46:16] insanity and get out and you know in her
[1:46:20] little
[1:46:21] clothing and she she she's actually now
[1:46:24] not a prostitute but actually now she is
[1:46:26] a
[1:46:27] prostitute and then and then if that
[1:46:29] same thing can take the world of
[1:46:33] sensible normal people with intelligence
[1:46:36] at an all-time high and actually make
[1:46:38] them just insane to where
[1:46:41] sensible
[1:46:42] people do things near the end time and
[1:46:46] it's happening around us now that are
[1:46:49] just insane the world has gone complet
[1:46:52] completely
[1:46:55] insane and and if that is something that
[1:46:58] can attack their
[1:46:59] Spirits because they have no cleansing
[1:47:03] agent then then don't we need our
[1:47:05] Spirits cleaned by the washing of the W
[1:47:08] the word constantly have our mind washed
[1:47:11] clean by the washing of the
[1:47:15] water of the
[1:47:17] word to clean our
[1:47:20] minds constantly that you're going to
[1:47:23] need that friends as long as you live in
[1:47:25] this
[1:47:26] [Music]
[1:47:27] flesh you know long as you live in this
[1:47:31] flesh I'm glad that the real me has
[1:47:33] already passed from Death To Life wasn't
[1:47:36] that wonderful you know I I preached
[1:47:39] many years ago brother Don many years
[1:47:42] ago I think it
[1:47:44] was might have been
[1:47:47] the third or fourth or fifth sermon I
[1:47:50] preached just a young man and I preached
[1:47:53] a
[1:47:54] sermon no it was probably more than that
[1:47:56] but I hadn't been preaching very long
[1:47:58] and I preached a sermon
[1:48:00] called the Great
[1:48:03] Soundwave and I was thinking about it as
[1:48:05] you were talking about that creative
[1:48:07] power of God and brother brandom
[1:48:08] actually talking about the sound waves
[1:48:10] of Jesus you know that you know and I
[1:48:14] and I remember brother Jason taking and
[1:48:17] I went into the scientific realm of it
[1:48:19] and how the many things they use sound
[1:48:23] waves in and you know they they can they
[1:48:27] can take sound and they can come along a
[1:48:32] reservoir and here you have this Great
[1:48:34] Wall holding back all of this water tons
[1:48:36] and tons and metric tons and tons and
[1:48:38] millions of tons of metric tons of
[1:48:40] pressure and water and the wall can look
[1:48:43] ever so fine and it doesn't look like it
[1:48:46] has any problems with it at all but they
[1:48:49] actually go along that thing ever so
[1:48:51] often and they've got like a
[1:48:53] sonar that fires sound waves into it and
[1:48:57] it bounces back off the backside and
[1:48:59] comes back through and they get a
[1:49:00] reading and they can see a flaw inside
[1:49:04] that doesn't show on the outside and I
[1:49:06] just I thought this I'm glad that a
[1:49:08] great sound wave came from on high that
[1:49:11] I might think I'm fine but it can go
[1:49:13] inside of me and come back and go now
[1:49:14] there's a flaw there you need to deal
[1:49:16] with oh my and then we went into the
[1:49:19] medical field and how they can use sound
[1:49:22] waves to heal
[1:49:23] you know bust up all kinds of stones and
[1:49:26] things Amen brother Andrew you're
[1:49:27] familiar with that amen and uh my sound
[1:49:32] is a great thing I'm glad I Heard a
[1:49:34] Voice I'm glad I heard I had a whole
[1:49:37] Litany of examples but I just remember
[1:49:41] uh how what a blessing and that brought
[1:49:43] that back to my memory tonight you know
[1:49:46] brother brandom made this quote and I
[1:49:47] thought about this quote you didn't
[1:49:49] quote it but I thought about it as you
[1:49:50] were preaching
[1:49:53] [Music]
[1:49:55] because something's got to bring us to
[1:49:57] that point friends something's got to
[1:49:59] get us to Zephaniah 3 what a beautiful
[1:50:03] foundational scripture to start that
[1:50:05] kind of a sermon on and if you go back
[1:50:08] and you read that again in Zephaniah the
[1:50:11] words were so
[1:50:14] beautiful how that he's going to turn
[1:50:17] the people back to Pure language that
[1:50:20] they may all call upon the name of of
[1:50:22] the Lord to serve him with one
[1:50:27] consent
[1:50:29] so brother brandham said it like
[1:50:32] this Christ is a mystery God
[1:50:35] revealed why do you hunger
[1:50:39] Church why do you thirst now I'm glad he
[1:50:42] didn't just ask us a question he gave us
[1:50:44] the answer it's the father trying to
[1:50:48] reveal his hidden secret to you now
[1:50:51] watch here's the now that's what's
[1:50:53] happening that's what's up but now let's
[1:50:56] talk about the problem here's the rub
[1:50:59] but you let so many things get that out
[1:51:03] of
[1:51:05] you now here's things that trouble our
[1:51:08] here we're getting to what troubles our
[1:51:10] spirit troubles our mind you let your
[1:51:13] job you let your wife you let your
[1:51:16] husband you let your children you let
[1:51:18] the cares of the world you let some
[1:51:20] Pastor you let somebody else get get
[1:51:22] that out of you when you know way down
[1:51:25] in your heart you're thirsting hungry I
[1:51:29] can so identify with that watch it's God
[1:51:34] trying to reveal it to you see and he
[1:51:37] says it like this the Revelation the
[1:51:40] last day is
[1:51:41] here and so to me when I read that quote
[1:51:46] he points to the solution of this
[1:51:48] terrible
[1:51:49] conundrum that there's so many things in
[1:51:52] the world we have a thirst and a hunger
[1:51:53] for God but so many things interfere
[1:51:56] with that and he says God is sending a
[1:51:59] solution in the last day to fix this
[1:52:03] problem and it's a revelation of the
[1:52:06] word in the last days I'm going to tell
[1:52:08] you something Friends when the on that
[1:52:11] morning all those problems will have
[1:52:14] been
