[4:27] and nothing that I have done.
[4:30] What grace and mercy. Amen. A loving
[4:33] father. Amen. If you have a request upon
[4:36] your heart this evening, you know, I got
[4:38] loved ones. I got all kinds of things
[4:40] going on. But I just commit it all into
[4:43] his. I know he knows about me. He knows
[4:46] what I have need of. I hope that wasn't
[4:48] me. Anyway,
[4:51] I'm just standing here. Praise the Lord.
[4:53] Let's pray.
[4:56] Father, I love you, Lord. So many times
[4:59] I think of
[5:01] why would you love somebody like me,
[5:03] Father?
[5:05] What was there done that I have done
[5:06] that you could look at and say,
[5:10] I like that. When I look and see my
[5:14] failures so often, my slips,
[5:18] I hear and feel that tender hand that
[5:20] just reaches down and
[5:23] tells me, "Get up, son. Just keep
[5:26] going."
[5:28] Lord, I thank you for that. I pray for
[5:30] each and everyone here, Father.
[5:33] Lord, the request upon our hearts in
[5:36] this dark day. Such a stressful time to
[5:38] be living in Leodysia.
[5:41] Everything's going dark, Father. But
[5:43] there is still light in Goan, light in
[5:45] our souls. I thank you for that, Father.
[5:48] Lord, I pray that you bless that gospel
[5:50] light this evening. Bless the tithes and
[5:53] offerings of your people, Father. Lord,
[5:55] bless the cheerful giver. Pray for those
[5:58] that are streaming. I know as I streamed
[6:00] a few services last weekend, Father, to
[6:04] feel your presence in the house. It was
[6:06] so powerful, so wonderful, Lord. your
[6:09] word going forth and your manifestation
[6:12] so evident. I pray for a a refreshing
[6:16] this evening for each and every one of
[6:18] you believing children. Father, I love
[6:21] you, Lord. I praise you. Remember the
[6:24] request upon the hearts. I pray that you
[6:26] meet everyone in Jesus Christ.
[6:34] I
[6:36] should have fallen.

[7:47] Amen. I want you to take a few minutes
[7:49] and just walk around a little bit. Let's
[7:51] do something a little different and just
[7:52] greet your brothers and sisters. Amen.
[7:55] Say, "God bless you." You don't have to
[7:58] just shake one or two hands. Just reach
[8:02] around and have a good time. Amen. In
[8:05] the Lord. Amen.

[28:46] follow-up service on Sunday, but I
[28:49] wanted to. Amen. So, tonight by the help
[28:53] of the Lord, I'm my plan is and plans
[28:55] are subject to change. I mean, subject
[28:59] to my change. I might get a change. We
[29:01] might all get changed and none of our
[29:02] plans come to pass. But, uh, my plan is
[29:06] to maybe take, uh, the first Wednesday
[29:08] of each month. I've been, uh, I started
[29:10] a month ago on a life principles series
[29:14] and I only got to preach the opening uh,
[29:17] introduction. We titled it the final
[29:20] example to the final eight. Taught it on
[29:22] a Sunday school class and was planning
[29:24] to, you know, go forward with that, but
[29:27] had other ideas, so we've had to wait.
[29:30] But, uh, I'm hoping tonight to move
[29:33] straight into that. Amen. I want to
[29:36] speak to you tonight on prayer and
[29:38] purpose. This will be the second
[29:40] installment uh in the life principles
[29:43] series. As I said, the first one, you
[29:45] can find it on Sunday school about a
[29:48] month ago, the final example to the
[29:49] final age. In fact, uh I probably will
[29:53] make a number of points and I I actually
[29:55] do have two or three quotes
[29:58] side that I showed at that one uh just
[30:01] to give a refresher. Amen. And u there
[30:05] and for all the extra people who didn't
[30:07] see that. Amen. All right. So, we're
[30:11] going to look let's have u
[30:14] presentationise.
[30:20] All right, we're going I'm going to go
[30:21] and read your announcement then, Matt,
[30:23] while you're getting that set up. Praise
[30:25] the Lord. We were going to wait on the
[30:26] end, but we'll go ahead and read this
[30:28] now. I think they're going to put it up
[30:30] on the the Matt's going to post it to
[30:31] the church. Also, reminder for the
[30:34] garage sale, you can drop off uh your
[30:37] donated items on Thursday and Friday.
[30:40] this week between 12 and 6. Uh, please
[30:44] call or text Brother John and Sister
[30:45] Meredith before drop off. That's where
[30:47] you're dropping them off apparently. Uh,
[30:49] Sister Meredith has some flyers to
[30:51] advertise if you know of somewhere to
[30:53] post them. See her after service for
[30:56] copies. And please be praying for some
[30:59] unusually cooler, dry weather on
[31:03] Saturday. Amen. Praise the Lord. Well,
[31:06] we had some freaky cool weather, you
[31:09] know. um a few weeks ago. So, I don't
[31:11] know if we got any of that left or not.
[31:12] So, but hey, you know, prayer changes
[31:15] everything.
[31:16] So, we're going to speak on prayer
[31:18] tonight and u purpose found in prayer.
[31:22] Praise the Lord. All right. So, prayer
[31:25] and purpose. We're going to look at Luke
[31:27] 11 1-4. If you want to turn in your
[31:30] Bibles, you can
[31:38] have it here on the slide.
[31:42] Gonna work
[31:50] next prayer and purpose. Now, let me let
[31:53] me give you a little bit of a tip just
[31:55] so that you will not get lost in the
[31:58] transition
[32:00] that I'm going to take tonight some
[32:02] things that I've been studying on prayer
[32:05] and actually the whole purpose side of
[32:08] it the Lord added in uh only a day ago.
[32:12] And um I I have a lot of things on
[32:16] prayer that I've read over the years and
[32:18] and so this is kind of you know I want
[32:20] to move into it. I definitely won't
[32:22] finish it tonight. Uh but uh we we want
[32:26] to really approach prayer from an angle
[32:30] perhaps that hasn't occurred to you. I
[32:33] know that the more I studied it, I was
[32:35] finding so many things that hadn't
[32:37] really occurred to me. It's kind of an
[32:39] almost an aha moment uh at times. And so
[32:43] I I want to you just to give me your
[32:45] undivided attention as we look into it.
[32:48] All right, let's get started, shall we?
[32:51] prayer and purpose. Luke 11 1-4.
[32:56] And it came to pass that as he was
[33:00] praying uh in a certain place, when he
[33:04] ceased, one of his disciples said unto
[33:06] him, Lord, teach us to pray as John also
[33:10] taught his disciples. And he said unto
[33:13] them, "When you pray, say, Our Father,
[33:17] which art in heaven." Now, I want you to
[33:19] catch the breakdown of these words. So,
[33:22] you have a father.
[33:24] Amen.
[33:25] He lives in heaven.
[33:27] All right? That's that's going to be so
[33:29] important that you visualize that.
[33:31] You're here on the earth. He lives in
[33:34] heaven.
[33:36] All right?
[33:37] Corporally the feet of Jesus does not
[33:42] touch this earth again when he ascended
[33:45] on the mount of olives. And and those
[33:47] angels said, "You men of Galilee, why
[33:49] stand you gazing here? The same one you
[33:52] see go will in so like manner come
[33:54] again." He does not put his physical
[33:57] corporal feet back on this earth again
[33:59] until Revelation 19 at the end of the
[34:02] tribulation period.
[34:05] So, so is he here among us? He is. But
[34:09] he has no feet but your feet
[34:11] and no hands but your hands in this
[34:13] world. See, no lips but your lips in
[34:16] this world. All right. So your father uh
[34:20] which is in heaven. He he sees from
[34:23] heaven. All good things come down come
[34:27] down from above from the father of
[34:31] lights. Amen.
[34:32] Am I Am I right? All right. So, catch
[34:35] what Jesus is saying here. Our Father,
[34:40] which art in heaven,
[34:42] hallowed be thy name. Now, catch this.
[34:46] Thy kingdom come. Who's the kingdom?
[34:49] Turn around and say, "Hello, kingdom."
[34:52] You're the kingdom. If you don't have
[34:54] people, you don't have a kingdom. You
[34:56] have a king. But if you ain't got
[34:57] people, you don't have a kingdom. All
[35:00] right?
[35:01] Hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come.
[35:04] Now, I chose Luke's version rather than
[35:07] Matthew 6 because of the way Luke words
[35:10] it right here. Thy will be done. As in
[35:15] heaven, so in earth.
[35:17] Amen.
[35:18] So, I want that
[35:21] in your mind. As in heaven, so in earth.
[35:26] All right. So now have I got you
[35:28] understanding that there needs to be
[35:30] some connection here?
[35:32] There needs to be some operation for
[35:36] that place to operate in this place
[35:41] with me.
[35:43] All right.
[35:45] Give us day by day our daily bread. And
[35:50] forgive us our sins.
[35:53] For we also forgive everyone that is
[35:56] indebted to us, those who trespass
[35:58] against you.
[36:00] And lead us not into temptation. So
[36:03] you're you're going somewhere. You're
[36:07] being led, but not in temptation.
[36:10] Amen.
[36:10] You understand? So the point is you're
[36:13] being led and you're praying. Don't
[36:15] you're going to lead me, Lord, and I'm
[36:17] going to follow. So, lead me away from
[36:20] temptation. Don't lead me into
[36:21] temptation, but deliver us from evil.
[36:26] And then, uh, Matthew picks up here, for
[36:29] thine is the kingdom and the power. So,
[36:34] now we have we found there's a kingdom.
[36:36] We found there's a God in heaven.
[36:39] There's a kingdom in the earth. This
[36:41] earth needs to reflect that heaven.
[36:43] There's power and glory forever.
[36:48] Amen. Let's pray.
[36:52] Lord, we thank you for your word that
[36:57] has been read this evening. And Lord, I
[37:01] just ask you now to be with my mind as I
[37:04] break this thought to the people. Lord,
[37:06] help me to describe it correctly and
[37:10] that I might create a picture in their
[37:13] mind, Lord, that it might be an
[37:15] awakening, Lord, to see the this great
[37:20] great life principle of prayer and
[37:25] purpose. I commit it to you in Jesus
[37:28] name. Amen. God bless you. You can be
[37:30] seated.
[37:44] Now,
[37:46] in the last when I did the introduction,
[37:51] I I I I wanted to catch the these
[37:54] weren't I I don't think I used these. I
[37:56] have some other ones that I that I did
[37:58] use, but I want you to look at the
[38:00] prophet here in the breach between the
[38:03] ages and the seals. Brother Brandham
[38:06] says, "And when the lamb slain walked
[38:10] forward from eternity out of the
[38:14] father's throne and took his rights," so
[38:17] it's his rights.
[38:19] It was a judgment seat. All right? So
[38:22] this is Christ, an image of Christ
[38:25] receiving his bride. How many want to
[38:27] manifest this?
[38:30] Receiving her at long last. Oh friends,
[38:34] receiving her at long last. Amen. Into
[38:37] divine fellowship and glory. And he says
[38:40] it became a judgment seat. Then he
[38:44] become not a lamb but a lion king. and
[38:50] he calls for his queen to come stand by
[38:55] his side.
[38:57] Now this has a a a direct application to
[39:02] you as a believer
[39:04] just before the catching away and the
[39:07] catching away.
[39:09] We are I believe in the corporal return
[39:14] of the Lord Jesus Christ. Brother say
[39:17] why do you believe that? Cuz brother
[39:18] Brandham said that's what believers
[39:20] believe.
[39:22] How many believers do we have here
[39:24] tonight?
[39:24] I believe he's coming. I don't believe
[39:26] it's a metaphor. I don't believe I'm in
[39:28] the millennium already. I've said many
[39:31] times, if this is the millennium, I want
[39:33] my money back.
[39:36] Oh, somebody tricked me. And so we I
[39:40] look forward to a corporal return of the
[39:43] Lord. I believe that the dead in Christ
[39:46] will rise physically and we physically
[39:49] will be changed into and sped up into
[39:52] that dimension and meet the Lord in the
[39:55] air. I believe that our future is
[39:58] bright.
[39:59] Amen.
[40:00] Amen.
[40:01] When I put my mind on that, nothing the
[40:03] devil does says really matters very much
[40:05] to me cuz I know I win anyhow.
[40:09] Amen.
[40:11] and I get restored to me everything the
[40:13] cruelty of sin took from me. I get it
[40:15] all back. Jesus said he loses nothing.
[40:17] Not just people. He loses nothing.
[40:20] Whatever image he had of you, that's
[40:22] going to be given back to you.
[40:24] Amen. I can't help what happened in life
[40:26] that took it from us, but I just know
[40:28] this that the devil loses and I win.
[40:32] So, so we find that he calls for his
[40:35] queen to come stand by his side. Now,
[40:38] that has an application right now
[40:41] because because we you say, "Well,
[40:43] that's when we go up in a rapture." But
[40:45] we also know there's been a descending
[40:47] of the mighty angel. And we also know
[40:49] that the word the same word like Noah
[40:52] when he built the ark, that same word
[40:54] that destroyed the world, but yet it God
[40:58] saved Noah in an ark. And so the very
[41:00] same gospel I just heard brother R say
[41:02] it today. The very same gospel that
[41:05] saves you is judgment to the unbeliever.
[41:08] See? And so we realize friends that
[41:11] right now we are we will stand by his
[41:15] side physically around the throne. But
[41:17] right now I am standing as an image of
[41:21] the word that he sent to this earth
[41:25] right now.
[41:26] Amen. Amen. you're that's that's why I
[41:30] opened with in this life principles
[41:35] series I opened with a title the final
[41:40] example
[41:41] to the final age.
[41:43] Amen.
[41:43] All right. More more on that in just a
[41:45] little bit. So he goes on. Now we we we
[41:50] showed you this last time from Nehemiah
[41:52] chapter 2. This is uh the king and and
[41:55] Esther on the throne. Uh and the king
[41:58] said unto me, speaking to Nehemiah, the
[42:01] queen also sitting by him. Only time in
[42:04] the Bible you find that. And the
[42:07] commentators all agree, history agrees,
[42:09] the math all agrees. This was obviously
[42:12] Esther seated. and and we and we said to
[42:16] you that uh on the last time that it
[42:19] actually Esther was seated on the throne
[42:22] at the approaching time for the feast of
[42:25] tabernacles speaking in one voice with
[42:28] the king. Now, the feast of tabernacles
[42:30] is the millennium, and you're right at
[42:32] it.
[42:33] And right at it, the the queen is now
[42:36] speaking in one unified voice with the
[42:39] king. And that's why Revelation 22:16
[42:42] says, "I, Jesus, have sent mine angel to
[42:46] testify unto you these things in the
[42:49] churches." Now, look what he says. I am
[42:51] the root and the offspring of David, and
[42:54] the bright and the morning star. Now,
[42:57] there's a there's a purpose for him
[42:59] saying it like this. See, he says,
[43:01] brother Brandham, Brother Brandham picks
[43:03] that up here and he says in uh uh uh
[43:07] provided God's provided place of
[43:09] worship, he says the morning star, the
[43:13] alpha omega, he is all the whole thing
[43:19] put together. He is both root and
[43:22] offspring of David the bright and
[43:25] morning star. He said he was that that
[43:29] be means he was before David in David
[43:32] and after David.
[43:34] Amen.
[43:35] So now the the fact that he's alpha and
[43:38] omega means that Christ was in bride
[43:41] form in Paul's day. Christ is in bride
[43:45] form again. Alpha and omega, the
[43:48] beginning and the end. the first and the
[43:50] last. It is the first and the last, the
[43:53] beginning and the end where he exists
[43:56] and lives, his pure bride who is who has
[44:01] accepted only the word of God and has
[44:03] rejected all other word.
[44:06] Amen.
[44:08] And therefore, brother Brandham could go
[44:10] on to say, now that you know you're
[44:12] included in alpha and omega, did you
[44:15] know that?
[44:16] Amen. Did you know you're included in
[44:18] the first and the last?
[44:20] Literally.
[44:21] Not figuratively. Literally.
[44:24] See, because it's been Christ what made
[44:26] him the alpha? He was in his church.
[44:29] What makes him the omega? He's returned
[44:30] in his church. And brother Brandon based
[44:33] on that could go along to say in him
[44:37] dwells the fullness of the godhead
[44:39] bodily. Where? Say it with me. Where we
[44:43] say it, we
[44:44] we
[44:45] in there are sons and daughters of God
[44:48] in God's Godhead.
[44:51] Hallelujah.
[44:52] Amen.
[44:53] That's quite a lofty position.
[44:56] Praise God.
[44:56] You are literally a part of God's
[44:58] Godhead because you're part of his
[45:00] expression.
[45:02] You understand that? That goes to prove
[45:04] that you were always in him and now
[45:06] you've been you're an expression of him.
[45:08] You're sons and daughters of God because
[45:10] you came from him. All right? Now,
[45:14] so when we look at it like that, so then
[45:16] this is exactly why we have the spirit
[45:21] at the end time and the bride like a
[45:24] hazarus and Esther, like king and queen
[45:28] just before the millennium. You have the
[45:31] spirit and the bride at the end of it
[45:33] all saying, "Come." She's the She's not
[45:37] only the last one to offer uh redemption
[45:41] to the world. She's the only one
[45:44] authorized.
[45:46] You heard me comment here some time ago.
[45:48] I was telling a story about some years
[45:50] ago when the Pope offered a Jubilee, a
[45:52] blanket Jubilee to the world, and they
[45:55] asked me about it, the brothers in
[45:56] Quebec, and they said, "What do you
[45:57] think about the Pope's Jubilee
[45:59] proclamation?" I said, "It's
[46:00] illegitimate."
[46:01] They said, "Why so?" I said because only
[46:03] the bride is authorized to offer
[46:05] jubilee.
[46:07] Only the bride can remit or retain sins.
[46:11] Because only the bride has the word of
[46:13] God. Only the bride can give eternal
[46:15] life. But the eternal life comes through
[46:18] the body.
[46:19] Amen.
[46:19] Amen.
[46:20] Amen.
[46:21] So the spirit and the bride say come.
[46:24] Now I'm Why am I angling this so hard in
[46:28] this direction? because I'm trying to
[46:31] get you to understand
[46:33] that. Okay, let me finish it. The spirit
[46:35] and the bride say, "Come." Let him that
[46:36] heareth say, "Come." Let him that is a
[46:38] thirst come. And whosoever will, let him
[46:40] take of the water of life freely. That's
[46:42] a pretty open invitation.
[46:46] I I reject
[46:48] that the world can cry foul,
[46:51] right?
[46:52] Amen. Because the invitation is so
[46:55] freely given and so wide open and covers
[46:59] every base and has a bride around the
[47:02] world beaming it
[47:04] to the world. The world is without
[47:07] excuse and I don't accept their pity
[47:10] party. I just say come to the fountain.
[47:14] Hallelujah.
[47:16] The reason that I'm angling this so hard
[47:20] in your mind is because as I
[47:22] demonstrated to you last time, whether
[47:25] we're talking about whole house family
[47:28] values, applying the token to your home,
[47:32] principles for a godly marriage, raising
[47:34] children the Bible way, transitioning
[47:37] your teen to adulthood, biblical
[47:40] dedication and finances. Regardless of
[47:43] what it is, we are the final voice to
[47:46] the final age. We are the final
[47:49] demonstration. We are the final example.
[47:52] You are the last will and testament of
[47:54] God's word and will for the earth.
[47:57] Amen.
[48:00] You get me?
[48:02] So, brother Brandham goes on to say in
[48:05] the rising of the sun and as he being
[48:09] the groom, the bride has to come forth
[48:12] because it's part of him and it can only
[48:15] be the manifestation of the fulfilling
[48:18] of all the revelation all the
[48:20] revelations any others has spoke of the
[48:23] bride. It can only manifest if it does
[48:26] something different from the groom. It
[48:28] isn't the bride.
[48:33] The bride looks like the word.
[48:38] The bride.
[48:40] I'm not talking about everybody that
[48:42] believes the message.
[48:46] The devil believes the message.
[48:49] He knows the will of God. He just
[48:51] refuses to do it.
[48:53] The Bible says you believe in God, you
[48:55] do well. No kidding. The devil does the
[48:57] same thing.
[48:58] Amen.
[48:58] See, so I'm not necessarily talking
[49:01] about who are just a people who are
[49:03] convinced of the doctrine. Listen
[49:05] friends, there is a there is a big
[49:09] gaping difference between agreeing with
[49:13] doctrine and having a revelation of
[49:16] Jesus Christ to you personally.
[49:20] There's a big difference in that.
[49:22] Amen. See, so I know this that the bride
[49:27] looks like the word, dresses like the
[49:30] word, acts like the word, talks like the
[49:33] word, reacts like the word.
[49:36] Hallelujah.
[49:37] Amen.
[49:38] Amen.
[49:39] The bride is diligent like the word,
[49:42] faithful like the word.
[49:44] Hallelujah.
[49:44] Honest like the word, eager, zealous
[49:48] like the word.
[49:50] See?
[49:50] Amen. All right. We're we're teaching on
[49:53] life principles. You were you with me?
[49:57] So he says it can only manifest if it
[49:59] does something different from the groom.
[50:01] It isn't the bride
[50:04] because she is flesh of his flesh, bone
[50:06] of his bone, life of his life, power. I
[50:08] love that. Power of his power. She is
[50:12] him. Now don't cut to the chase and go
[50:17] saying, "Yeah, power. Mhm. give it to
[50:20] me.
[50:21] Well, if you want power like him, if you
[50:24] want power of his power, you need you
[50:26] need to have life of his life.
[50:29] You need to be bone of his bone. You
[50:31] need to be not faith in the son of God
[50:34] merely, but the faith of the son of God.
[50:39] All right?
[50:41] She is
[50:43] him. Beautiful,
[50:46] beautiful quote.
[50:49] As man and woman Oh, did I miss one? As
[50:52] man and woman are one, and woman taken
[50:56] from his side, she has taken a spirit,
[50:58] the feminine spirit from him, the flesh
[51:01] from his side, made both mechanics and
[51:04] dynamics. See, that's the that's the
[51:07] male and female part of it.
[51:08] Amen.
[51:10] Mechanics and dynamics.
[51:13] the wife, the spirit of him, and the
[51:16] flesh of him, and put it together, and
[51:20] made mechanics and dynamics.
[51:23] So, there's a flesh of him,
[51:25] and there's a flesh of him.
[51:27] Amen.
[51:28] Amen.
[51:29] Amen.
[51:30] Put him and she is him together, and
[51:35] you've got mechanics and dynamics.
[51:38] Like a husband and wife. All right.
[51:42] Brother Brandham says now, he says in
[51:44] Speak to the Mount, we read this months
[51:45] ago in a in our lengthy series, if the
[51:49] person through the atonement sanctified
[51:52] by the blood of Jesus Christ can live
[51:55] into a sphere with God so close that he
[51:59] can be wrapped so completely in God by
[52:02] the blood of Jesus that it wouldn't be
[52:04] him talking. It wouldn't be it would be
[52:06] the Holy Spirit speaking these things.
[52:09] Amen. And brother and brother Brandham
[52:11] goes on to say, "And no more than I'd
[52:15] said that till the anointing of the Holy
[52:17] Spirit struck me like I have never had
[52:21] before in all my life. God knows that. I
[52:24] raised up to my feet. I got scared and
[52:28] something said to me, "Now this is the
[52:31] beginning of your new ministry."
[52:34] Amen.
[52:35] See
[52:37] now ask what you will and it shall be
[52:40] given to you. What is a fold of the
[52:43] third pull? Brother Jason a bride with
[52:46] the mind of Christ speaking with
[52:49] creative power.
[52:51] Not you see it's not you deciding it's
[52:55] that you made a choice. Say oh yeah man
[52:58] give me that. I want that. You know, you
[53:01] there first of all, you wouldn't even
[53:02] know how to do it un wouldn't know how
[53:05] to operate it. You'd mess it up unless
[53:07] you're willing.
[53:09] You're willing
[53:11] to live into a sphere with God so close
[53:16] that he can be wrapped so completely.
[53:19] This is the man so wrapped completely in
[53:22] God. I say, Lord, it's that or perish.
[53:24] It's wrapped completely or bust. I have
[53:27] no no desire to have any degree. I'm not
[53:31] chasing nine out of 10. I want all of
[53:34] it. I want to be so completely wrapped
[53:37] in God
[53:39] that I have obviously stopped at some
[53:41] point thinking my own thoughts entirely.
[53:47] All right.
[53:49] So, let me see what I want to hit here.
[53:53] All right. So we come then to
[53:56] prayer and purpose. And I want to give
[54:00] you a little sub little subheading here,
[54:02] a little subtitle
[54:05] called kingdom connectivity. Amen.
[54:09] Connectivity is how your phones operate
[54:11] with the towers and your computers
[54:14] operate and your watch and your your
[54:16] phone and your computer and your tablets
[54:18] and and your your smart appliances and
[54:22] that they all have connectivity between
[54:24] them and it enables them to think as one
[54:28] so that you hit a notice here, a notice
[54:31] here, notice here and and and notices
[54:33] that you get over notified.
[54:36] Amen. But now I'm brother Brandham
[54:39] always shows us that what you see
[54:43] happening in the world is just what's
[54:45] happening at a much higher level.
[54:48] The fact that that we have an
[54:50] information superighway. I'm here to
[54:52] tell you we have an information
[54:54] superighway.
[54:55] Amen.
[54:55] That we have artificial intelligence.
[54:59] I'm here to tell you that's a sign to
[55:01] you and I that the mind of Christ is now
[55:04] ready to flow completely in his bride.
[55:06] Amen.
[55:07] They're worried about an AI takeover. I
[55:09] would love to have a word of God take
[55:11] over.
[55:12] Oh, I just say take over right now, Lord
[55:14] God. Take over all my life and all my
[55:17] mind and all my plans and all my dreams.
[55:20] Amen.
[55:25] When we talk about purpose,
[55:30] various sources that I drew from
[55:33] describe purpose as in in a number of
[55:36] ways. Let me give you this list. It's
[55:38] quite informative. Purpose
[55:41] describes, you know, when you're living
[55:44] with a purpose, some define it as the
[55:48] ultimate expression of the human
[55:52] condition,
[55:53] the culmination
[55:55] of our rational faculties, our emotional
[55:59] drives, and our moral values. Purpose is
[56:03] a big word.
[56:06] Others claim it is also the essence of
[56:10] what separate I thought this was
[56:11] interesting. It's the essence of what
[56:14] separates us from the rest of the
[56:16] natural world that it's that which
[56:19] elevates us to a higher plane of
[56:21] existence. Because as human beings with
[56:24] with the power to reason and free moral
[56:26] agency, then the then we are we not only
[56:32] are the only ones that have the ability
[56:34] to raise up and live with a purpose,
[56:38] to live for something larger than
[56:40] yourself.
[56:42] Amen.
[56:42] To live for an idea. To live with a
[56:46] purpose. To live on purpose.
[56:50] Amen.
[56:52] I'd like to say to live with
[56:54] righteousness on purpose,
[56:57] to live with holiness on purpose. Do
[57:00] do I have some purpose-driven people
[57:03] here today?
[57:04] Amen.
[57:05] My How about it, young people? How about
[57:07] you teenagers? Do I Do I have some
[57:09] teenagers, some young people, some
[57:11] senior youth that say, "I want to have
[57:13] purpose in my life."
[57:16] Amen.
[57:20] I want to make some statements to to the
[57:23] senior youth here in just in a moment
[57:24] about this very topic.
[57:29] One source mentions that it it that
[57:32] living with purpose means aligning one's
[57:36] actions with the principles,
[57:39] excuse me, aligning one's actions with
[57:42] one's principles and being accountable
[57:46] for the consequences. No wor no wonder
[57:49] we have such an aimless world
[57:51] because nobody will accept consequences.
[57:53] It's never anyone's fault
[57:56] and no one will admit guilt
[57:59] and that's I that's not an exception to
[58:02] the rule. That's the rule.
[58:05] And everybody everybody's playing by the
[58:08] same rule book. People get fined. People
[58:12] get penalties but no one admits guilt.
[58:15] Right.
[58:17] Amen.
[58:18] And the government allows that to happen
[58:20] because they also want to admit guilt
[58:22] and nobody admits guilt. And and
[58:25] children want to blame it on parents.
[58:30] Uh spouses want to blame it on each
[58:33] other.
[58:34] Amen.
[58:36] Somebody's got to be to blame for the
[58:38] terrible problems I'm having.
[58:42] That's the spirit of the age. I I say
[58:45] defy that.
[58:47] I say if you're going to live with
[58:48] purpose, be willing to say I I will live
[58:51] by principles of God's word and I'm
[58:54] ready to face the consequences of it.
[58:58] See,
[58:59] so it's aligning one's actions with
[59:02] one's principles and being accountable
[59:04] for the consequences. It means being
[59:07] aware of one's place in the grand scheme
[59:10] of things and contributing to the
[59:11] greater good. I thought that was very
[59:13] noble.
[59:15] I found that in all the various sources
[59:18] that I drew meaning from this very large
[59:22] word, I found that that they all seem to
[59:26] agree
[59:28] that living with purpose brings many
[59:31] benefits to yourself
[59:34] and many benefits to others in your
[59:37] orbit.
[59:40] perfectly
[59:42] uh contraise. If you are aimless and
[59:46] don't live with character and
[59:49] principles, then those in your orbit
[59:52] will suffer.
[59:53] Yes.
[59:57] Listen to some of these advantages. Now,
[1:00:00] young men, young women, pay real close
[1:00:03] attention because here are some
[1:00:05] advantages of living with purpose.
[1:00:10] If you live with purpose, it fosters a
[1:00:13] sense of fulfillment,
[1:00:15] satisfaction,
[1:00:17] and happiness.
[1:00:19] It enhances one's self-esteem,
[1:00:22] confidence, and resilience. It inspires
[1:00:26] creativity,
[1:00:28] innovation, and excellence.
[1:00:31] It generates positive impact, positive
[1:00:34] influence, and a positive legacy. Now I
[1:00:37] ask you today, friends, is there any
[1:00:40] purpose that you could think of better
[1:00:43] at establishing these admirable
[1:00:46] qualities that that more than living by
[1:00:49] a divine purpose?
[1:00:52] Could you imagine if if mankind is
[1:00:55] willing to see and can see and admits
[1:00:57] that just having a purpose, I mean your
[1:01:00] purpose might be to conquer the world. I
[1:01:02] don't know. But your your purpose might
[1:01:05] you know people have all kinds of
[1:01:06] purpose. Oh I want to go to Nashville. I
[1:01:08] want to go to Hollywood. I want to be on
[1:01:10] a ball team. I want to do this. I want
[1:01:11] to be rich. I want to have this. I want
[1:01:13] to have that.
[1:01:15] And people run with all kinds of
[1:01:16] purpose. But I'm here to tell you that
[1:01:19] if if just the fact of having purpose
[1:01:22] can can generate positive impact and
[1:01:24] positive influence and positive legacy.
[1:01:27] What would happen if your whole life was
[1:01:30] dedicated to the divine purpose?
[1:01:33] for your life.
[1:01:35] Amen.
[1:01:40] Here's a question for you, and I got a
[1:01:42] following follow-up question right
[1:01:45] behind it.
[1:01:48] What do you see as your divine purpose?
[1:01:52] It's a fair question.
[1:01:54] What do you see? What do you see
[1:01:57] as your divine purpose?
[1:02:01] My follow-up question is is an attempt
[1:02:03] to give you a little clarity and help
[1:02:06] you along to think about it.
[1:02:09] What do you see as your divine purpose?
[1:02:12] Why
[1:02:13] did God redeem your soul and yet leave
[1:02:17] you here still?
[1:02:23] What's life about? He redeemed my soul
[1:02:26] from sin. Let me just go to heaven. No.
[1:02:28] You mean you're going to redeem me and
[1:02:30] give me eternal life? Yep. That I can
[1:02:32] never lose. Correct. I'm sealed in. Yep.
[1:02:35] Signed, sealed, and delivered. Yep.
[1:02:36] You're already in heavenly places in
[1:02:38] Christ Jesus.
[1:02:39] Amen.
[1:02:40] But I'm going to leave you here. Why?
[1:02:43] Because I have a purpose.
[1:02:46] I have a purpose for you. And that's why
[1:02:49] I redeemed your soul. Because the only
[1:02:52] one the only
[1:02:55] the only ones that can be redeemed are
[1:02:57] the redeemable.
[1:03:00] Amen.
[1:03:00] See, we're not talking about basic
[1:03:02] salvation like those who acquire at the
[1:03:05] at the end of the millennium. We're
[1:03:08] talking about redemption much further
[1:03:09] than salvation from destruction.
[1:03:12] Redemption means to buy back to bring
[1:03:15] back something that previously was.
[1:03:17] That's why brother Brandon would say
[1:03:18] only the predestinated are considered in
[1:03:20] redemption. See,
[1:03:23] so living your life, I want to say this
[1:03:25] to you today now as you're thinking
[1:03:27] about your divine purpose. I'm talking
[1:03:29] about life principles.
[1:03:31] These are life principles.
[1:03:35] Living with your divine purpose
[1:03:39] is not easy.
[1:03:41] Amen.
[1:03:43] It's not easy. Not in this world.
[1:03:47] It requires courage.
[1:03:50] It requires discipline.
[1:03:54] It requires sacrifice.
[1:03:56] Amen.
[1:03:57] I want to read that little list again.
[1:04:00] Living your life with divine purpose is
[1:04:04] not easy because you're in a world that
[1:04:07] hates all things divine
[1:04:10] and the whole world from education to
[1:04:14] business to entertainment to recreation
[1:04:17] to the functions of living. Every day,
[1:04:19] whether you're in the market, whether
[1:04:21] you're in the woods, whether you're
[1:04:22] wherever you are, the whole world is
[1:04:25] designed to defeat you living with
[1:04:28] divine purpose. They don't mind you
[1:04:30] having purpose as long as it's not god-
[1:04:33] driven.
[1:04:36] So, living a divine purpose is not easy.
[1:04:39] It requires, I say again, courage.
[1:04:43] It requires discipline. And it requires
[1:04:46] sacrifice.
[1:04:48] Yeah,
[1:04:49] absorb that.
[1:04:51] It requires sacrifice. Nothing worth
[1:04:54] having is worth having at all if there
[1:04:57] isn't some cost that has to be paid to
[1:05:00] get it.
[1:05:02] If it just falls in your lap and it's
[1:05:04] just free, you won't value it. It
[1:05:06] doesn't it doesn't it doesn't have that
[1:05:08] effect like as if you went out and
[1:05:11] struggled and sacrificed and earned it.
[1:05:14] Amen.
[1:05:16] This world
[1:05:18] ruins men.
[1:05:21] Amen.
[1:05:22] It robs them of divine purpose. I want
[1:05:24] to say to young men today, I want to say
[1:05:27] to you uh senior men, senior youth,
[1:05:31] particularly senior youth men, young men
[1:05:36] from from the age right here. Mason, how
[1:05:40] old are you?
[1:05:42] Oh, you're 13, almost 14. And that's the
[1:05:44] beginning of our senior youth group and
[1:05:47] it goes on up from there.
[1:05:50] I I hope Sister Deborah doesn't faint
[1:05:52] when I'm about she's at home with Elijah
[1:05:54] sick. But I want to say to all of you
[1:05:57] young men, rebel.
[1:06:03] Please
[1:06:05] rebel.
[1:06:07] Have a spirit of rebellion against
[1:06:10] Leodysa.
[1:06:12] Amen. That's it.
[1:06:13] Amen.
[1:06:14] Rebel young men against that spirit that
[1:06:19] has made a generation of not men, a
[1:06:22] generation of dish rags,
[1:06:25] jellyfish
[1:06:26] with no fiber and no character and no
[1:06:29] integrity,
[1:06:32] no leadership, no morals, no scruples,
[1:06:34] no character.
[1:06:36] Rebel against it. Have some discipline.
[1:06:39] I charge you today, you young men, have
[1:06:41] some discipline. Make up your mind now
[1:06:44] while you're young. Make up your mind
[1:06:47] now. I'm going to be driven by
[1:06:49] character. I'm going to have a divine
[1:06:52] purpose
[1:06:53] in my life. Don't go another day without
[1:06:57] it.
[1:06:59] Paul said, "I write unto you young men
[1:07:02] because you're strong." Amen.
[1:07:07] I challenge you young sisters to do the
[1:07:09] same.
[1:07:12] Do the same. Hold your virtue by the
[1:07:16] highest standards and morals. This world
[1:07:19] seeks to do nothing but pollute your
[1:07:21] mind. And and young girls at very young
[1:07:24] age are being ruined and polluted before
[1:07:26] they can hardly escape the cradle. And
[1:07:29] they're being ruined and polluted.
[1:07:31] Amen. and homes and parents who have
[1:07:33] lost their natural affection for
[1:07:35] children.
[1:07:36] Amen.
[1:07:37] I'm here to tell you something, friends.
[1:07:40] You, you young men and young women,
[1:07:42] thank God for Christian parents. Thank
[1:07:45] God for a pastor in a ministry who loves
[1:07:48] you. Thank God that we'll tell you the
[1:07:50] truth.
[1:07:51] Hallelujah.
[1:07:53] I want to say to you, young sisters, be
[1:07:56] an impeccable lady of the highest order.
[1:08:00] Amen.
[1:08:01] of the highest order.
[1:08:03] You should require any man who wants
[1:08:06] your attention. He should be gallant. He
[1:08:10] should be honest. He should be decent
[1:08:13] and decent minded. He should be a hard
[1:08:16] worker. He should be diligent.
[1:08:20] I'm here to tell you, if he doesn't,
[1:08:22] Listen, sister, if he doesn't pursue
[1:08:24] excellence now, I promise you, he won't
[1:08:28] do it after you marry him. Amen.
[1:08:31] Amen.
[1:08:35] Divine purpose demands determination.
[1:08:39] Divine purpose demands constant growth
[1:08:42] and learning.
[1:08:45] I told you that
[1:08:48] divine purpose requires courage
[1:08:53] because the diligent pursuit
[1:08:56] of it
[1:08:58] exposes you to criticism,
[1:09:01] much opposition,
[1:09:03] and conflict.
[1:09:05] But living a divine purpose is worth it.
[1:09:10] It's worth it. I'm here to tell you it's
[1:09:13] worth it living a divine purpose. You'll
[1:09:17] never regret a day that you spent
[1:09:20] striving for excellence in divine
[1:09:23] purpose for your life.
[1:09:26] It's the only way to make your life
[1:09:29] meaningful.
[1:09:33] It's hard to face years and decades and
[1:09:36] turn around and see others excelling,
[1:09:40] going past you, circles around you,
[1:09:43] while you linger and languish in in
[1:09:47] laziness and contempt and nothingness
[1:09:51] and get decades in and your peers have
[1:09:54] already excelled and you're just
[1:09:56] spinning your wheels trying to blame
[1:09:58] somebody.
[1:09:59] [Music]
[1:10:01] Oh, put the blame on the devil tonight.
[1:10:04] Resist him, reject him, rebel against
[1:10:06] him, and say, "Tonight, I'm going to
[1:10:08] take divine purpose for my life."
[1:10:14] Not only is it the only way to make your
[1:10:16] life meaningful, it's the only way to
[1:10:17] transcend the limitations of this
[1:10:19] physical world.
[1:10:20] Amen.
[1:10:22] God
[1:10:24] redeemed you. He redeemed your soul,
[1:10:29] but he left you here.
[1:10:32] Now, it's a mouthful. Now, I'm now I'm
[1:10:34] going to turn a corner.
[1:10:38] Coming to prayer, and it's part in
[1:10:41] purpose.
[1:10:44] I said to you that purpose is the only
[1:10:47] way to transcend the limitations of this
[1:10:49] physical world. God redeemed your soul
[1:10:53] and yet left you here so that so that so
[1:10:58] that your physical life can transcend
[1:11:05] the limitations
[1:11:07] of this physical world.
[1:11:13] God redeemed your soul
[1:11:16] to do nothing less
[1:11:19] than connect you with a direct
[1:11:23] connection to the source of all
[1:11:26] existence.
[1:11:29] Connectivity
[1:11:30] to the source of all existence connects
[1:11:34] you to your purpose in life. No other
[1:11:38] source, no other source but the source
[1:11:41] of all existence can reveal to you true
[1:11:46] purpose. I'm sure you know who I'm
[1:11:50] talking about.
[1:11:52] You actually have a head start. You were
[1:11:54] made in his image.
[1:11:57] Connecting your soul to God
[1:12:01] takes all
[1:12:03] the guesswork out of your life. Amen.
[1:12:08] Amen.
[1:12:11] Connecting to God,
[1:12:14] having divine
[1:12:16] connectivity to God takes all the
[1:12:20] guesswork
[1:12:25] out of your life.
[1:12:29] Thus sayaith the Lord
[1:12:33] will settle 99%
[1:12:36] of any and all anxiety you ever
[1:12:40] encounter from the cradle to the grave.
[1:12:46] It'll take 99% of all the anxiety just
[1:12:50] being in connection with thus sayith the
[1:12:51] Lord. Say brother Jason what about the
[1:12:53] other 1%. Then there is that 1% where
[1:12:56] you will encounter things and they will
[1:12:58] present questions and I'm just here to
[1:13:00] tell you sometimes that 1% is going to
[1:13:03] be a question of the answer of which
[1:13:06] lies in another world.
[1:13:09] Amen.
[1:13:09] And you'll get your answer but you might
[1:13:11] not get it here in 1% of the cases. But
[1:13:14] I'm here to tell you, if you're
[1:13:16] connected deeply to the source of life,
[1:13:19] even in those times, even in those times
[1:13:21] when there are no answers to the trials
[1:13:23] you face, there will remain in you an
[1:13:27] abiding peace that passes understanding.
[1:13:32] There is no substitute for being
[1:13:35] connected to the source of all
[1:13:38] existence.
[1:13:38] Amen.
[1:13:43] The greatest dimensional portal to
[1:13:46] living in the divine purpose God has for
[1:13:49] you
[1:13:51] is prayer.
[1:13:55] Prayer is a dimensional doorway.
[1:14:01] Prayer is actually
[1:14:04] as simple as ABCs and yet more profound
[1:14:07] than quantum physics.
[1:14:10] more profound than any knowledge can put
[1:14:13] it in a textbook. Prayer
[1:14:17] in what it's and what and what it can do
[1:14:20] and how it does it. But yet it's so
[1:14:23] simple. I mean it it's it's so rich in
[1:14:27] power, you know, it's so deep in
[1:14:30] understanding.
[1:14:31] That's all true, but yet its workings
[1:14:34] are simple. A child can pray.
[1:14:36] Amen.
[1:14:38] a child can pray. In fact is the Lord
[1:14:41] has no trouble getting a child to pray.
[1:14:44] He easily gets them to believe their
[1:14:46] simple faith is almost like a shield
[1:14:49] against unbelief. It's grown-ups. It's
[1:14:52] adults, adult men and adult women who
[1:14:55] have who have, you know, encountered
[1:14:59] hazards of life and trials and
[1:15:02] tribulations and ups and downs and ins
[1:15:04] and out and disappointments. too many
[1:15:06] disappointments and sorrow somewhere
[1:15:09] along the way. You know, they they they
[1:15:11] they if you're not careful, you get into
[1:15:13] a place where
[1:15:16] trial after trial and hardship after
[1:15:18] hardship gets you to a place where you
[1:15:21] you know that you you get further and
[1:15:23] further away from the only source that
[1:15:25] can help you. Amen.
[1:15:28] The devil bends your mind and clouds
[1:15:30] your heart,
[1:15:31] darkens your reasoning,
[1:15:34] and and the love of God is glowing all
[1:15:36] around you, but you're you're you're
[1:15:38] closed in in anger and bitterness and
[1:15:40] dissatisfaction of life. Oh, let me tell
[1:15:43] you tonight, there's an answer for that.
[1:15:46] There's a there's a bomb in Gilead that
[1:15:49] can bring healing to you right now.
[1:15:52] Amen.
[1:15:54] Somewhere along the way, people
[1:15:56] sometimes allow Satan to convince them.
[1:15:58] They they they get into such a fix and
[1:16:01] they get in a hole and try to dig their
[1:16:03] way out. And the only do thing they do
[1:16:05] is dig theirself further in. Sometimes
[1:16:08] Satan can convince them they are their
[1:16:09] own best answer. That's always false.
[1:16:12] Amen.
[1:16:14] If you got you into it, you ain't going
[1:16:16] to get you out of it. Amen.
[1:16:18] You're going to need a higher power.
[1:16:20] Somebody who's smarter than you.
[1:16:22] Somebody who knows the end from the
[1:16:24] beginning. And it's going to have to be
[1:16:26] somebody who cares.
[1:16:28] Let me tell you, Jesus cares.
[1:16:31] Hallelujah.
[1:16:32] Amen.
[1:16:35] It's a sad state to get in. Young men,
[1:16:37] young women, don't get there.
[1:16:40] Don't allow yourself to go down that
[1:16:43] road. The God of this evil age
[1:16:46] has persuaded too many. Too many
[1:16:53] that fortune and glory,
[1:16:56] education and popularity,
[1:16:59] these are the true best goals for life.
[1:17:04] You know why people believe that? Cuz
[1:17:06] they've fed on too many poisons and
[1:17:08] toxins of this sin-cursed world. Amen.
[1:17:12] Their divine purpose is hardly
[1:17:15] acknowledged at all.
[1:17:17] No wonder, no wonder Jesus said, "Unless
[1:17:19] you come as a child,
[1:17:22] unless you're willing to come as a child
[1:17:25] and humble yourself and say, I renounce
[1:17:29] the very notion that fortune and glory
[1:17:31] is the best thing for my life. I
[1:17:33] renounce that education and popularity
[1:17:35] are the holy grails for my life."
[1:17:37] They're not
[1:17:39] divine purpose that God redeemed you for
[1:17:42] yet left you here.
[1:17:45] The divine purpose of what it is he
[1:17:47] wants out of your life. There is nothing
[1:17:50] in any degree. If you take one degree
[1:17:53] less than that, that's one degree less
[1:17:55] power, one degree less glory. If you
[1:17:58] take 50% less, that that's 50% less
[1:18:01] satisfaction, 50% less happiness. Just
[1:18:04] get ready for 50% more anxiety, 50% more
[1:18:08] trouble, 50% more weariness.
[1:18:23] world. One writer called it a prodigal.
[1:18:25] Called the whole world that.
[1:18:28] And God's family come in lost in sin.
[1:18:32] But yet the Holy Spirit has managed to
[1:18:35] win some of his children back.
[1:18:39] Here you are sitting today. You know
[1:18:41] why? Because the Holy Spirit led you
[1:18:44] back.
[1:18:46] And it's a it's a it's a fair wage wager
[1:18:49] that somebody probably introduced it to
[1:18:52] you or you saw something or you met
[1:18:54] something or heard something or you were
[1:18:55] born into a family and you were told
[1:18:57] something. One way or another, God has
[1:18:59] got you back and now he has a divine
[1:19:02] purpose. Go and get the rest of them.
[1:19:05] Hallelujah.
[1:19:08] Those of us who have been won back from
[1:19:10] the devil may be the very pathway back.
[1:19:13] Amen.
[1:19:14] The very pathway back to God for others
[1:19:20] that you want to see make it. I got some
[1:19:22] people I want to see make it.
[1:19:25] I might be the pathway back.
[1:19:34] When God When Christ is invited, Brother
[1:19:38] Bram says he always comes.
[1:19:40] when he's invited.
[1:19:42] You see, there's only one inlet of power
[1:19:45] in the human life. Listen, friends,
[1:19:47] don't forget this. If you go home
[1:19:48] tonight, and this is the only thing you
[1:19:50] remember, there is only one inlet of
[1:19:52] real power, and that's the Holy Ghost. I
[1:19:57] don't care what you ever achieve or
[1:19:59] accomplish.
[1:20:01] I don't care what station you arrive at.
[1:20:04] It doesn't matter. They might you might
[1:20:06] have your name in lights. That doesn't
[1:20:08] matter. The only form of real true power
[1:20:11] that can give you real true divine
[1:20:13] purpose is the Holy Ghost.
[1:20:16] Amen.
[1:20:17] He eagerly enters every door that's open
[1:20:19] to him. That's the good news. He comes
[1:20:22] in by invitation and consent. And if you
[1:20:24] invite him, he'll come. And if you
[1:20:27] invite him today, say, "Lord, take the
[1:20:28] cares of this life off of me and fill me
[1:20:30] with your life." He'll do it. That's his
[1:20:33] promise.
[1:20:35] Oh, his promise within is the vital
[1:20:37] thing. But with many of us, here's the
[1:20:40] problem with many of us. Even while he's
[1:20:42] in, he's not really in control. He's
[1:20:44] kind of like a guest
[1:20:50] rather than a host.
[1:20:53] I just say, Lord, how about you be the
[1:20:56] host and I be the guest for once?
[1:20:59] How about you set the direction? How
[1:21:01] about you do the leading and you do the
[1:21:03] guiding and you do the deciding? How
[1:21:06] about you, Lord God? Just take over my
[1:21:07] life. I I just I just want to be the
[1:21:10] guest here, Lord. You be the host of
[1:21:11] this temple.
[1:21:13] Hallelujah.
[1:21:15] Oh, I'm here to tell you something,
[1:21:16] friends. There's no limit to where
[1:21:19] prayer can lift you to.
[1:21:22] You may listen, you you might be the
[1:21:24] rarest of all saints. You You might have
[1:21:26] the greatest brain ever known to to the
[1:21:28] human race. You might have the the the
[1:21:31] best mental disciplines. You might you
[1:21:33] might have you might have a prayer life
[1:21:35] that would put us all to shame. But I'm
[1:21:37] here to tell you that there is still yet
[1:21:40] to you even to you with your superior
[1:21:43] mind and brain and prayer life and
[1:21:45] everything you got going there's yet
[1:21:47] untouched ground that even you can
[1:21:49] achieve too.
[1:21:51] The the bottom line is we should never
[1:21:53] stop excelling. We should never stop
[1:21:56] seeking. We should never stop pressing
[1:21:59] toward the mark.
[1:22:02] Amen.
[1:22:04] Say, does prayer
[1:22:07] make a difference? Prayer does make a
[1:22:09] difference.
[1:22:11] There's no limit, as I said, to where it
[1:22:14] can lift you. Prayer changes everything.
[1:22:16] You hear me? I'm fond of saying that.
[1:22:18] People say prayer changes things. I say
[1:22:19] prayer changes everything
[1:22:22] because when you pray you unleash powers
[1:22:25] that are very ancient and very powerful
[1:22:31] and they spun worlds into existence.
[1:22:36] I I was just sharing a a little thing
[1:22:39] with uh brother Mark the other day and
[1:22:42] we're all time tossing back and forth
[1:22:44] these little tidbits that we see. we
[1:22:46] both have an interest in these things
[1:22:50] and they were talking about you know
[1:22:51] their latest telescope that they've
[1:22:54] they're launching and they're going to
[1:22:57] study you know a hundred I think a
[1:23:00] hundred billion galaxies
[1:23:03] and it's just a little little area of
[1:23:05] space but it's a 100 billion galaxies
[1:23:08] and billions of billions of stars in
[1:23:10] each galaxy
[1:23:13] until it just starts blowing fuses is I
[1:23:16] mean, you know, do you know why they
[1:23:18] they they they find they try to find all
[1:23:20] of these classm so planets. They try to
[1:23:22] find water. You know, if we can find the
[1:23:25] the building blocks for life, you know,
[1:23:27] if God was going to put life on there,
[1:23:28] he would have done that. He would have
[1:23:29] put water. He would have put an
[1:23:30] atmosphere. You say, "Well, they they do
[1:23:33] have places, brother Jason, they do have
[1:23:35] places where they can see that that's
[1:23:37] kind of close. There's some atmosphere
[1:23:39] there and there there's probably some
[1:23:41] ancient water there." And and I just say
[1:23:44] I say, "Why is there no life there?" Cuz
[1:23:45] God hasn't seated them
[1:23:47] yet.
[1:23:50] He hasn't seated them yet. But they're
[1:23:53] there for a reason.
[1:23:55] He doesn't do anything. I'm preaching on
[1:23:57] purpose. God doesn't do anything without
[1:23:59] a purpose.
[1:24:00] Oh, there's a land beyond the river. One
[1:24:04] of these days, friends, Brother Bam
[1:24:06] said, "Everything you've ever wondered,
[1:24:07] all the questions you've ever had, it'll
[1:24:09] all be answered on that other side.
[1:24:12] eternal unfolding of the mystery of
[1:24:14] Christ in the eternal ages to come. What
[1:24:16] a day.
[1:24:19] Prayer changes everything. I got to I
[1:24:21] got to hit a pause place here. It ch
[1:24:24] here's something that prayer does. It
[1:24:27] changes the man
[1:24:29] or the sister.
[1:24:31] Yeah. Amen.
[1:24:32] It changes you
[1:24:36] if you let it.
[1:24:38] Amen.
[1:24:39] Do you have things in your life that the
[1:24:43] the devil has on you
[1:24:48] and he constantly gets it over on you
[1:24:51] and you don't want it and you don't like
[1:24:53] it and you hate it and you've had to
[1:24:55] repent so many times. Oh my goodness.
[1:24:58] Friends, I'm here to tell you I have one
[1:25:00] thing I have proven. Prayer can change
[1:25:03] that.
[1:25:04] Prayer can take that thing off of you.
[1:25:07] Prayer can ascend you into the
[1:25:08] heavenlies and God can can build word on
[1:25:11] top of word on top of word on top of
[1:25:13] word. Brother Brandham says if you need
[1:25:15] that, ask God
[1:25:17] that you've got a prophet's privilege. A
[1:25:19] prophet is saying to you, ask God to
[1:25:22] pile word on top of word on top of word
[1:25:25] until you come into the image of a son
[1:25:27] and daughter of God.
[1:25:29] That's what prayer can do for you. It's
[1:25:32] prayer. Prayer is your purpose.
[1:25:35] See, prayer connects you to your
[1:25:37] purpose. Prayer can give you the
[1:25:40] discipline to turn off those toxins and
[1:25:43] poisons that are killing your spiritual
[1:25:45] life, killing your power with God.
[1:25:50] Spurgeon says, "Banish forever." Look
[1:25:52] here, young men. Banish forever all
[1:25:56] thought of indulging the flesh if you
[1:25:59] would live in the power of your risen
[1:26:01] Lord. Amen.
[1:26:02] I'm not I just got one question. How
[1:26:04] many want to live in the power of the
[1:26:06] risen Lord?
[1:26:07] Then banish forever. Here's an old
[1:26:09] veteran telling you, "Banish the thought
[1:26:11] of it. Forget it. Say, Lord, take it
[1:26:14] away from me. Purify my mind."
[1:26:18] That's why I said, "Young men, be
[1:26:19] disciplined." Young sisters, be
[1:26:21] disciplined. Be excellent.
[1:26:24] Amen.
[1:26:25] Hallelujah.
[1:26:28] Prayer.
[1:26:29] I want to say make these last closing
[1:26:31] comments before I move to
[1:26:35] I got just one illustration slide and a
[1:26:38] quote I read at the end as we're calling
[1:26:41] the musicians forward. But let me get
[1:26:43] this first.
[1:26:51] At heart,
[1:26:53] prayer is not a shopping list.
[1:26:59] It's not what prayer's for. Say, "Well,
[1:27:02] I need to tell him all my needs." He
[1:27:03] already knows them.
[1:27:05] Your father already knows what you have
[1:27:06] need of. And he's already promised to
[1:27:09] supply it.
[1:27:12] Half the things you fred over in prayer,
[1:27:14] he's already got in line, ready to drop
[1:27:16] on you.
[1:27:16] All you have to do is accept his
[1:27:18] promise.
[1:27:19] Bring your life close to him. Live up
[1:27:21] there in those spheres. And I promise
[1:27:23] you, power of God will start dropping in
[1:27:25] your life. Amen.
[1:27:27] At heart, prayer is partnership.
[1:27:31] Now, that's an angle I want to really
[1:27:33] drill in. Prayer is partnership.
[1:27:38] It means a man or a woman of God and the
[1:27:42] Lord Jesus are working together for the
[1:27:45] same thing. That's prayer.
[1:27:49] Amen.
[1:27:50] Say, you got scripture to prove that?
[1:27:52] Absolutely, brother Brandham. And I've
[1:27:54] got not only the scripture to prove it,
[1:27:56] but I've got a prophet's interpretation
[1:27:58] of the scripture. Jesus stood looking
[1:28:00] one day in the gospels and he looked out
[1:28:02] and he said to his disciples, "The field
[1:28:04] is truly
[1:28:06] the field is white under harvest, but
[1:28:08] the labors are few. Pray ye to the Lord
[1:28:11] of the harvest that he send forth
[1:28:12] laborers." And brother Brandon picks
[1:28:15] that up and said, "Here Jesus was
[1:28:17] saying, pray to the Lord of the harvest
[1:28:19] that he sends laborers." And he said he
[1:28:21] was the Lord of the harvest. And he
[1:28:23] said, 'What was he saying? I want to do
[1:28:26] this. This is something I want to do,
[1:28:28] but I want you involved. I want you to
[1:28:30] pray. I want you to connect with me. I
[1:28:33] want a partnership. I want you to ask me
[1:28:35] to do what I already want to do.
[1:28:38] Why? Because this is about a kingdom.
[1:28:42] This is about a a kingdom of saints in
[1:28:45] partnership with Christ.
[1:28:48] That's what prayer is.
[1:28:51] Two persons knit together in a strong
[1:28:55] tie of personal love and affections. You
[1:28:58] and Christ to be totally absorbed in the
[1:29:01] same driving objective.
[1:29:04] See
[1:29:08] this is prayer.
[1:29:14] This is a light coming from the father.
[1:29:18] And the only way to get it into the
[1:29:20] earth through seven church ages is to
[1:29:22] send it through a sun,
[1:29:24] to send it through a prism, to send it
[1:29:27] through a type of Christ. And it breaks
[1:29:30] the life of God down into all seven
[1:29:33] ages.
[1:29:34] Amen.
[1:29:34] This is this is what what you're doing
[1:29:38] and what he's doing.
[1:29:40] This is a partnership.
[1:29:42] This is camaraderie. This is you and
[1:29:45] Christ. Uh that that's why the Bible
[1:29:48] says that you're heirs of God,
[1:29:51] but joint hes with Christ.
[1:29:53] An heir of God. That word in the Greek
[1:29:55] just simply means you have an allotment,
[1:29:57] but nothing's been allotted because you
[1:29:59] not even been born again. You're an heir
[1:30:01] of God, but you differ nothing from a
[1:30:03] child, though you be Lord of all, the
[1:30:04] Bible says, because you haven't been
[1:30:06] born again yet. See, once the tutor
[1:30:09] comes along and you get a new birth and
[1:30:10] you get sealed in, then now you're not
[1:30:12] just an heir of God. You become a joint
[1:30:15] heir with Christ. That means that you
[1:30:17] have an allotment and something has been
[1:30:19] allotted and you are standing with Jesus
[1:30:22] shouldertosh shoulder and reaching
[1:30:24] together in the treasure chest. You are
[1:30:27] joint hes with Christ.
[1:30:33] A joint heir. This is what prayer. This
[1:30:36] is what the purpose of your new birth
[1:30:38] is. It's for you and God and your mind
[1:30:41] and his mind and your heart and your
[1:30:42] heart to come into the same purpose.
[1:30:46] So that he's walking in your feet and
[1:30:48] talking through your lips and acting in
[1:30:50] your hands. He has none but yours.
[1:30:54] He's called for his queen to stand by
[1:30:56] his side.
[1:30:58] Hallelujah.
[1:31:02] Everybody prays sometime.
[1:31:04] People say, "Oh, I'll never pray.
[1:31:08] Let me tell you, a desperate need in a
[1:31:11] critical moment pulls the heart of
[1:31:13] sinner to his knees.
[1:31:16] There's something inside of every man. I
[1:31:18] don't care whether they'll admit it or
[1:31:20] whether they just know it when they're
[1:31:24] lay their head on their pillow at night.
[1:31:26] As I've said many, many times, you can
[1:31:30] be one thing and be all brave and be all
[1:31:32] tough and have a and be an atheist as if
[1:31:34] you want to be, but when your life comes
[1:31:37] down to the edge
[1:31:38] and it's just you and God.
[1:31:40] Amen. I'm here to tell you something pre
[1:31:43] friends that even prideful men I when
[1:31:47] something there's something inside of
[1:31:49] every man even prideful men that that
[1:31:52] make him make him want to lift up his
[1:31:54] inner heart to some unseen force.
[1:31:58] There's something in him that does that.
[1:31:59] It's in every man everywhere. S you know
[1:32:02] sin sin pulls you away. It's Christ that
[1:32:04] pulls you in. And and and the devil
[1:32:07] gives everybody religion. See, religion
[1:32:10] is, you know, why have we had religion
[1:32:12] for thousands and thousands and
[1:32:15] thousands all the way back to recorded
[1:32:16] history? Uh they've got they've got cave
[1:32:19] drawings of people worshiping.
[1:32:20] Yeah. Amen.
[1:32:22] Why does he do that? See, because
[1:32:24] there's something inside him. Of course,
[1:32:26] religion is is just the superstition
[1:32:29] blinded attempt to get back in touch
[1:32:31] with God. That's what makes the gospel
[1:32:33] of Christ the only true religion.
[1:32:35] Amen.
[1:32:36] Hallelujah. because it answers. Only the
[1:32:38] gospel of Christ answers to that longing
[1:32:41] in the heart of a man.
[1:32:43] To get back in touch with his maker.
[1:32:45] He's somewhere. I know he's somewhere.
[1:32:48] The deep calling to the deep. I'm here
[1:32:51] to tell you the gospel of Christ is the
[1:32:53] one true source of truth. It's the It's
[1:32:56] the whole truth. It's nothing but the
[1:32:58] truth. The truth of how of how things
[1:33:01] actually stand between God and man.
[1:33:09] How we come into the world without hope.
[1:33:13] Five minutes in the presence of God
[1:33:15] changed us back to our original true
[1:33:18] relation.
[1:33:20] That's what prayer can do. It's knowing
[1:33:24] him and the power of his resurrection.
[1:33:31] I know brother Brandon use it both ways.
[1:33:32] The scripture is to know him and the
[1:33:36] power of his resurrection.
[1:33:37] Amen.
[1:33:38] Brother Brandham coined it both ways.
[1:33:40] You can see in the quotes he'll
[1:33:41] sometimes say it that way and sometimes
[1:33:43] to know him in in the powers. It's also
[1:33:45] true. It's also true. Both both sayings
[1:33:47] are true. Prayer is the natural
[1:33:50] expression of that longing in every
[1:33:51] man's heart. God answers prayer.
[1:33:58] I'm over time. Can I take seven or eight
[1:34:00] more minutes?
[1:34:01] Amen.
[1:34:05] God answers prayer.
[1:34:08] That's a fact of prayer. That's a fact
[1:34:11] of prayer. God answers prayer.
[1:34:16] I mean, you can see it in nature. You
[1:34:17] can see how that a a little child
[1:34:22] who is too young to even be able to form
[1:34:25] the words yet, but can reach up to a to
[1:34:29] its mother. And somehow her with her
[1:34:33] motherly instinct, she hears these
[1:34:34] certain sounds and half-pronounced words
[1:34:37] and a reaching hand and a pleading
[1:34:39] voice. And what happens? It's as if that
[1:34:42] as if there's some unseen presence over
[1:34:45] that child that bends down and hears the
[1:34:48] petition and meets the need. Hallelujah.
[1:34:51] I'm here to tell you that's exactly what
[1:34:53] happens to a a man at work when he he he
[1:34:55] he's being pressed upon by this job or
[1:34:58] by the world or by money or by this and
[1:35:01] he don't even have time to get alone and
[1:35:03] pray. So, you know what he does? He just
[1:35:04] sends a prayer up from the inside. He
[1:35:07] just sends it straight through and an
[1:35:08] unseen being bends down and listens
[1:35:12] closely or some sister in her daily
[1:35:15] duties and some trial pressing her soul.
[1:35:18] I'm here to tell you there's an unseen
[1:35:20] man who bends down and listens closely
[1:35:24] to do what? Meet that need. Why? Because
[1:35:27] he loves her.
[1:35:31] That's prayer.
[1:35:33] It's not a Santa Claus. It's a
[1:35:35] relationship. It's a partnership.
[1:35:39] It's you being the conduit of his life
[1:35:43] in the earth.
[1:35:45] He doesn't come to the earth until
[1:35:46] Revelation 19. But he's got he's got a
[1:35:49] pipe. He's got a tunnel. He can get his
[1:35:51] life down into the earth and it'll go
[1:35:54] everywhere because I'm carrying it and
[1:35:56] you're carrying it. And we become the
[1:35:58] word made flesh again.
[1:36:01] Hallelujah.
[1:36:03] That's prayer.
[1:36:10] that unseen one,
[1:36:12] the great lover of my soul.
[1:36:17] That's a simple fact of prayer.
[1:36:21] Prayer gets things done.
[1:36:25] It changes things that need changing,
[1:36:28] things that otherwise might go unchanged
[1:36:30] and damage somebody. Prayer gets it
[1:36:33] done.
[1:36:35] Prayer, you know, if we're not careful,
[1:36:38] we just let Satan roll right through our
[1:36:39] families,
[1:36:41] roll right through our homes, roll right
[1:36:43] through our children, roll right through
[1:36:46] and we get all afraid, we get all
[1:36:47] nervous, and the sky is falling. You got
[1:36:50] prayer.
[1:36:51] You can arrest that devil. You can be an
[1:36:54] effective barrier. You can contact God
[1:36:58] and bring the power of God to bear upon
[1:37:00] that thing. I don't care what it is. It
[1:37:02] doesn't matter. There's no power like
[1:37:05] God's power.
[1:37:07] It gets things done.
[1:37:10] Things that can't be done in any other
[1:37:12] way. People get help.
[1:37:16] Sometimes it takes a certain kind of
[1:37:19] power. And the problem is people need a
[1:37:21] power and there's no way to get to that
[1:37:23] power. There's no way to get to it.
[1:37:25] Not in this, not in this body.
[1:37:28] So you know what happens?
[1:37:31] Prayer swings into action.
[1:37:33] Amen.
[1:37:34] Two hearts get connected. Yours and his
[1:37:40] you're you're you're connected and
[1:37:43] you're you're connected. You're walking
[1:37:44] around now. You're anointed with power.
[1:37:48] Now you're serving him. Prayer isn't to
[1:37:52] serve you. Prayer is to serve him. See,
[1:37:56] it releases a power. I'm telling you
[1:37:58] some friends it defeat that's what
[1:38:00] that's what brother Brandon was talking
[1:38:01] about when he said it'll defeat Satan
[1:38:03] anytime any place under any condition
[1:38:06] doesn't matter what it doesn't matter
[1:38:07] what it is it releases a power that gets
[1:38:10] things done
[1:38:13] that's what prayer power prayer is the
[1:38:16] power to get things done so now you have
[1:38:18] a purpose
[1:38:20] now you have a purpose I read you a
[1:38:23] whole list of how wonderful it is to
[1:38:25] have purpose now you know what purpose
[1:38:28] really is? For you and God to be in
[1:38:31] partnership and for him to drive his
[1:38:33] will through you and me.
[1:38:36] Friends, there could be no greater
[1:38:40] accomplishment in life. The next time
[1:38:43] you pray, I want you to remember friends
[1:38:46] that the simple fact of prayer is that
[1:38:50] it it it it hard it it softens hard
[1:38:53] hearts. It changes stubborn wills. It
[1:38:57] solves problems, impossible problems. It
[1:39:00] answers questions. It opens up ways when
[1:39:03] there was no way. It sickness gives way
[1:39:05] to health. Finances get blessed.
[1:39:08] Marriages get repaired. Children get
[1:39:10] saved. Whole families get restored. This
[1:39:14] is the simple fact of prayer.
[1:39:18] Prayers go up. It's true.
[1:39:23] Prayers do go up
[1:39:25] and nothing comes down. That happens.
[1:39:30] Prayer is not, listen, prayer is not you
[1:39:32] trying to change God's mind, trying to
[1:39:34] change his will. Prayer helps you to
[1:39:36] accept his will.
[1:39:38] Prayer is to get you in harmony with
[1:39:40] what he already has the will to do.
[1:39:44] So you're when you're asking him in
[1:39:45] prayer, nothing wavering. You're asking
[1:39:47] him to perform all his will. And prayer
[1:39:51] is to get you conditioned to receive it,
[1:39:53] whatever it happens to be. It's not to
[1:39:55] change his mind. That's not the purpose
[1:39:58] of prayer. And sometimes people don't
[1:40:01] they pray and and and and nothing comes
[1:40:04] down. They say, "Oh, I don't believe in
[1:40:05] prayer." Well, that's ridiculous.
[1:40:08] Oh, I don't believe in God. I don't
[1:40:09] believe in the power. Well, that's
[1:40:10] that's nonsense. I don't I people don't
[1:40:13] even actually believe that. They believe
[1:40:14] they believe that. They don't even
[1:40:15] believe it themselves,
[1:40:16] right? I mean, goodness gracious, you
[1:40:19] you're I'm sure we've all had times
[1:40:21] where our clock stopped and wouldn't
[1:40:22] work and you wound it and shook it and
[1:40:24] banged it and put batteries in it and it
[1:40:26] was done. Did you lose confidence in
[1:40:29] time?
[1:40:30] Did Did you stop operating by time? You
[1:40:34] You find a watch that works. You find a
[1:40:35] clock that works. You don't give up on
[1:40:37] on clocks.
[1:40:40] Amen. Your cell phone uh loses signal.
[1:40:44] Do you give up on cellular technology?
[1:40:46] Your internet won't connect. So what?
[1:40:48] Yeah. Move some wires. Do something.
[1:40:50] Reset it. You don't give up on that. So
[1:40:53] sometimes, listen, people there, we get
[1:40:55] cars break down, trucks break down. You
[1:40:58] don't throw the truck in the river.
[1:41:00] What's wrong with it is there's a a
[1:41:02] little part somewhere that has stopped
[1:41:04] working.
[1:41:05] You don't lose confidence in the truck
[1:41:07] or the car. You fix the part.
[1:41:10] Sometimes people can't get a prayer
[1:41:12] answered. I say, "Go through and find a
[1:41:14] broken part." There might be something
[1:41:17] broken in your home or your life and you
[1:41:20] just need to fix it.
[1:41:23] You don't stop praying. You don't doubt
[1:41:25] God.
[1:41:27] You you you investigate. You repair. You
[1:41:29] turn over every stone. You repent.
[1:41:34] Oh, I got to stop. I just got to stop.
[1:41:39] Prayer works.
[1:41:42] Even if it's not working for you, it
[1:41:43] works. Amen.
[1:41:46] These are just simple principles
[1:41:50] that underline prayer. So simple that
[1:41:54] anyone with faith,
[1:41:56] a pure heart, and a clean life makes use
[1:42:01] of this great power.
[1:42:05] It's not a matter of brain power,
[1:42:08] special ability, education, or social
[1:42:12] standing. It's really a matter of you
[1:42:17] choosing to be a vessel of God.
[1:42:23] It's that simple.
[1:42:28] One big simple principle
[1:42:32] that lies at the very root of the whole
[1:42:34] thing
[1:42:36] is that you come in contact
[1:42:40] in connectivity
[1:42:42] with Christ.
[1:42:43] Amen.
[1:42:44] That you connect your life to him. Amen.
[1:42:51] Being a companion with him, being a
[1:42:55] partner with him. Please, the next time
[1:42:58] you pray, hear my words turning in your
[1:43:02] head. When you pray, think of it that
[1:43:05] way now. I'm a companion to him. I'm a
[1:43:09] partner with him. He's my true friend.
[1:43:13] Until, friend, you do that until he
[1:43:15] becomes more real than just some distant
[1:43:18] being in heaven. He literally becomes a
[1:43:21] part of your everyday life.
[1:43:24] Brother Anthony, bring your team. Look
[1:43:26] at this quote.
[1:43:29] Brother Brandham, catch it. He's in a
[1:43:31] prayer. Now, read with me. He's in a
[1:43:34] prayer. I love I You know what I love? I
[1:43:37] love to listen to Brother Brandon pray.
[1:43:40] You know why? Because years ago, I said
[1:43:42] to myself, "Wow, what would a prophet
[1:43:44] pray if he prayed?" And I'd like to kind
[1:43:47] of hear what a prophet would pray.
[1:43:50] Here's what he prays. Lord, he's saying,
[1:43:52] if I have found favor with you, Lord, I
[1:43:56] pray that you'll send a double portion
[1:43:58] tonight
[1:44:00] that it'll be that I will not speak, but
[1:44:03] let the Holy Spirit speak in who I
[1:44:06] testify.
[1:44:08] And may in speaking, may great signs and
[1:44:12] wonders break forth. And may this whole
[1:44:15] audience, I'm praying that right now.
[1:44:16] May this whole audience break forth for
[1:44:20] that living water springing up like
[1:44:22] geysers out of the soul. Lord, that you
[1:44:26] told this Samaritan woman about.
[1:44:30] And may we lay our tired, weary souls at
[1:44:33] your feet tonight and drink until we
[1:44:37] bathe into the beauty of God. Until we
[1:44:41] forget about we forget all about this
[1:44:44] sensebound
[1:44:46] existence
[1:44:48] and move out yonder into a place where
[1:44:51] the spheres beyond the stars where we
[1:44:53] can find favor with God find healing for
[1:44:57] our bodies and rest for our souls.
[1:45:02] How many want to get past this
[1:45:04] sensebound existence?
[1:45:06] I'm tired of feeding these senses. I'm
[1:45:09] tired of struggling. I I want to have
[1:45:12] purity. Let's stand to our feet. I want
[1:45:14] to have wholesomeness. I want to have
[1:45:16] zeal. I want to have character. I want
[1:45:18] to have drive.
[1:45:19] I want to have power with God.
[1:45:22] Abandon all thoughts of mort of
[1:45:24] satisfying the flesh. Mortify the deeds
[1:45:27] of your flesh.
[1:45:28] Amen.
[1:45:29] That you may have power with God. Amen.
[1:45:34] Come and gather around, friends. We're
[1:45:36] already out of time. Come on and gather.
[1:45:38] Brother Anthony, sing for us. Amen. I
[1:45:41] mean, Brother Matthew.
[1:45:43] [Applause]
[1:45:44] Come on, gather up close.
[1:45:50] I'd rather
[1:45:52] be led
[1:45:55] by his nail
[1:45:58] pierced in
[1:46:01] than to be
[1:46:04] the king
[1:46:06] of a master
[1:46:12] and be held
[1:46:14] in sin
[1:46:17] Praise him.
[1:46:22] I'd ra
[1:46:24] [Music]
[1:46:26] Jesus
[1:46:29] [Music]
[1:46:36] afford.
[1:46:40] Let me get these requests. Brother Matt,
[1:46:41] just keep playing that for me. Sister
[1:46:43] Ruth. Sister Deborah asked prayer for
[1:46:45] Elijah. very sick at home.
[1:46:49] I also spoke to brother Juel today.
[1:46:53] He is home from the hospital, but the
[1:46:55] devil is still fighting him very
[1:46:57] severely with some kind of bronchitis or
[1:47:00] something in his lungs. He's suffering
[1:47:02] quite a bit. He's asking for prayer.
[1:47:04] Brother Joel Forny, Brother Richie
[1:47:06] Douglas also asked for prayer today. The
[1:47:09] devil's been battling him. He fell and
[1:47:12] hurt himself and somehow something got
[1:47:15] in the wound or something. I wasn't too
[1:47:17] clear, but it's really made him sick and
[1:47:20] he's asking the Lord to help him.
[1:47:23] Brother Blue's entire assembly, Brother
[1:47:26] Lee Blue, uh y'all know perhaps Brother
[1:47:29] Joe, the short stocky black brother, has
[1:47:32] a mustache and he's their song leader
[1:47:34] and their deacon. Brother Joe, um his
[1:47:38] family, I think he lost six members of
[1:47:40] his family, including his 101year-old
[1:47:43] mother, to a violent crime. It's in the
[1:47:46] news. And uh they have some young man
[1:47:49] captured who went in and slaughtered
[1:47:51] them. And and uh Brother Joe's really
[1:47:54] hurting tonight. Lost a mother and a
[1:47:55] brother and a bunch of nieces. And um
[1:47:59] they're asking for prayer there for the
[1:48:02] entire assembly. Let me see. Um, my mom
[1:48:07] has a praise report. The church prayed
[1:48:09] last week for my brother Vic. This my
[1:48:11] uncle Vic going in for unexpected open
[1:48:14] heart surgery. He had four bypasses and
[1:48:17] doing great. Thanks to pray. Thanks for
[1:48:20] praying and and and God and answering
[1:48:23] prayer. Amen. Praise the Lord. I think
[1:48:25] that's all of the prayer requests I that
[1:48:28] I have. If I don't uh remember any
[1:48:31] others and I don't see any others
[1:48:34] than anything
[1:48:39] this world
[1:48:42] affords
[1:48:44] today.
[1:48:46] Oh, let's raise up our hands. I'd rather
[1:48:48] have Jesus. I'd rather
[1:48:52] have Jesus
[1:48:55] than anything.
[1:48:56] [Applause]
[1:49:00] I'd rather
[1:49:02] be his
[1:49:04] than have riches
[1:49:07] untold.
[1:49:10] I'd rather
[1:49:12] have Jesus
[1:49:14] than houses
[1:49:17] or land.
[1:49:20] I'd rather
[1:49:22] be led
[1:49:24] by his name
[1:49:29] than to be
[1:49:32] a king of
[1:49:35] vast
[1:49:37] domain.
[1:49:39] or be held
[1:49:42] in sin.
[1:49:50] I'd rather
[1:49:52] have Jesus
[1:49:55] than anything
[1:49:59] this world
[1:50:02] affords
[1:50:05] today.
[1:50:08] Take the hand of somebody standing near
[1:50:10] you. Lord, we are coming to you tonight
[1:50:14] on behalf of our own little brother
[1:50:15] Elijah. Lord, sickness has struck his
[1:50:18] body just yesterday. Saw him running
[1:50:20] around wide open, full speed, robust
[1:50:23] little boy. The enemy's come in, Lord,
[1:50:25] to try to bring sickness on him. We
[1:50:27] condemn the work of the enemy. I pray
[1:50:29] against the devil, Lord, and I ask that
[1:50:31] the Holy Spirit release our little
[1:50:34] brother back to health. I ask that Satan
[1:50:36] take his hands off of God's property.
[1:50:39] Satan, you are a trespasser with no
[1:50:41] rights whatsoever.
[1:50:44] Lord, we are praying for brother Jewel
[1:50:46] tonight, your servant, Lord, and the
[1:50:48] devil has battled him sore, but Father,
[1:50:51] he's he said, Lord, the He told me, he
[1:50:53] said, "Brother Jason, the devil's
[1:50:54] fighting, so I'm just going to keep
[1:50:55] fighting." Well, we're going to fight
[1:50:57] with him in prayer. Lord, I pray you'll
[1:50:59] raise him up back to health. remember
[1:51:01] brother Richie Lord also with this
[1:51:04] terrible sickness Lord. Father that's
[1:51:06] battling his body speaking to him today.
[1:51:08] I can hear the weakness in his voice. I
[1:51:10] pray Lord that you touch your servant.
[1:51:12] Father, we're thinking Lord Jesus of of
[1:51:16] our own little baby Zoe tonight. Lord
[1:51:18] God, this church standing in one mind
[1:51:22] and one accord. We will not back away.
[1:51:25] We are asking for a miracle from God on
[1:51:28] high. Lord, you are the you are the you
[1:51:31] are the leader of your family. You are
[1:51:33] the father of all your kingdom. Lord
[1:51:36] God, none can move your hand or stay
[1:51:39] your decisions. Lord, we're asking and
[1:51:41] appealing for our little sister tonight.
[1:51:44] Lord, we're asking for brother Lee's
[1:51:46] assembly and brother Joe. Sad day and
[1:51:49] broken hearts, Lord. Father, his mother,
[1:51:52] a wonderful Christian sister and
[1:51:54] believer. She's not suffering at all,
[1:51:56] Lord. She's not stressed. She's happy.
[1:51:58] But we're sad for the family, Lord.
[1:52:00] That's a terrible way to lose loved
[1:52:02] ones. And I I just say the cruelty of
[1:52:05] sin knows no bounds. Lord, have mercy. I
[1:52:08] pray, Lord, on that family. Oh God, lift
[1:52:12] us up above the shadows, Lord Jesus. And
[1:52:15] may we, Father, stand, stand, Lord God,
[1:52:18] with arm in arm, faith in faith, heart
[1:52:21] to heart, and take take, Lord, the whole
[1:52:24] kingdom for the glory of God. May you
[1:52:27] grant these things to us in Jesus
[1:52:30] Christ's name. Amen. Amen. Let's sing
[1:52:34] again, brother.
[1:52:36] He is here.
[1:52:39] Hallelujah.
[1:52:42] Oh, he is here. Amen.
[1:52:49] Oh, he is here.
[1:52:52] Holy,
[1:52:54] holy,
[1:52:57] I will bless his name again.
[1:53:02] For he is here
[1:53:08] closely.
[1:53:09] Hear him calling
[1:53:13] out your name.
[1:53:15] [Music]
[1:53:19] And you can touch him. You will never
[1:53:26] be the same.
[1:53:30] Amen. We got a wonderful testimony from
[1:53:32] Sister Jean already. Anybody else got a
[1:53:34] testimony before we go? Sister Melissa.
[1:53:36] Um, some Oh, here we go.
[1:53:42] [Music]
[1:53:44] I think that's one pass that
[1:53:47] [Music]
[1:53:49] um I had was visiting with my nephew who
[1:53:51] lives in Georgia. they stream our
[1:53:52] services and oftent times they'll asked
[1:53:54] us um to pray for certain things and I
[1:53:57] don't even remember when it was that we
[1:53:59] put this prayer request in but today
[1:54:01] when we were visiting we was just
[1:54:03] talking and and you know one
[1:54:05] conversation led to another and he we
[1:54:07] had started talking about um
[1:54:11] um
[1:54:12] it well what it led to was he was
[1:54:14] talking about falling and he said that
[1:54:17] one of the guys he worked with had fell
[1:54:19] I think he said 30 or 35 ft He's like,
[1:54:22] "Yeah, we prayed for him, remember?" And
[1:54:24] honestly, I I didn't. He's like, "Yeah,
[1:54:26] we turned the prayer request in." And
[1:54:27] he's like, "And he's made a full
[1:54:29] recovery."
[1:54:29] Praise God. Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:54:34] Any others tonight before we go? Praise
[1:54:36] the Lord. Amen. Praise the Lord. God
[1:54:38] bless you. Well, still getting you out
[1:54:40] at 9:00 even though I preached too long.
[1:54:43] I had a preacher, a seasoned veteran. He
[1:54:45] said, "Brother Jason, stop apologizing
[1:54:49] for your time." He said, "Just preach
[1:54:52] the word, brother." So, I told him, I
[1:54:54] said, 'Well, well, I almost said his
