[36:47] um sister sweetheart when you come on up
[36:50] sister dave is going to sing a
[36:52] special for me today that i requested
[36:55] it's an oldie goatee and
[36:56] um just i've been amazed since yesterday
[37:02] amen i've been amazed since yesterday
[37:05] at the men's breakfast just how
[37:09] sovereign the mind of god is
[37:11] and the lesson that brother jason
[37:14] took for us brothers it was remarkable
[37:18] to me
[37:19] because i had been i had actually notes
[37:23] in my notes at that moment sitting there
[37:25] that were
[37:26] almost just a continuation of some of
[37:29] the things he was saying and then this
[37:31] morning in the sunday school class i was
[37:32] just left almost stupefied i couldn't
[37:34] believe it
[37:35] that some of the things and i hadn't
[37:37] talked to brother jason about anything
[37:40] and yesterday and today it just shows me
[37:43] the sovereign
[37:44] mind of god and then to hear
[37:48] those specials and the very words and
[37:50] i've been listening for the words and
[37:52] just so beautiful and this song
[37:55] um
[37:56] [Music]
[37:58] it's i i have a hard time singing it
[38:01] because i come to a certain line
[38:04] and it's it's called the shepherd of my
[38:06] valley and it's what would i do without
[38:08] jesus and
[38:10] man i don't know what i would do without
[38:13] jesus i don't even i don't know what i
[38:15] could do i couldn't face the world and
[38:17] face
[38:18] life and you know man that's born of a
[38:20] woman is just a few days and
[38:22] full of trouble and what would i do
[38:26] without the lord i don't know how people
[38:29] face it
[38:29] you know and um you know um
[38:33] my mother and i we were talking and i
[38:36] want to say happy mother's day to her
[38:38] and all the mothers here today
[38:40] amen uh because of them we're all here
[38:44] and uh we were talking about that very
[38:47] concept how did the world
[38:48] endure without the presence of god in
[38:52] their lives and i said well mom they
[38:53] don't really that's why
[38:55] we have an opioid crisis that's why we
[38:57] have
[38:58] madness in the streets and politics have
[39:01] gone crazy and
[39:03] and and men's hearts failing for fear
[39:06] because they don't have christ and
[39:09] they're not
[39:10] coping so this is kind of an old
[39:13] throwback but i love it her mom used to
[39:15] sing it and did you ever sing it do you
[39:16] sing it with her
[39:17] yeah her mom i i kind of when i first
[39:21] met the family
[39:22] her mom was singing this and i i've
[39:25] loved it ever since and so
[39:27] sister debbie has a very similar voice
[39:29] and style to her mom's got some pipes
[39:31] that's where matt gets his
[39:33] loud and americans those loud those loud
[39:35] pipes
[39:36] but uh amen so i want you just to uh

[47:07] so god bless you let's turn in our
[47:09] bibles this morning
[47:11] to ephesians chapter one i'm looking
[47:14] forward to my
[47:16] lesson today and i call it that on
[47:18] purpose
[47:19] because i'm i'm going to i have so much
[47:23] that i want to cover i've decided today
[47:25] to make a powerpoint and actually use it
[47:27] amen sometimes i send a powerpoint to
[47:29] the booth and they just look at me like
[47:30] you actually going to use this today
[47:33] so i'm actually going to use it today
[47:34] because i have so many quotes and it
[47:36] doesn't mean i'm going to preach a long
[47:37] time but i want to i want to move
[47:39] through them quickly
[47:40] but there's a lot for you to take in
[47:43] today and there'd be
[47:44] no way just no way you'd get you'd be
[47:46] able to
[47:47] you'd get lost in the shuffle because we
[47:49] want to cover a great deal of ground
[47:51] today and actually make
[47:53] some simple points but there's nothing
[47:57] in the word of god that's really simple
[47:59] it's
[47:59] it's simple in it that christ reveals it
[48:02] but the meaning is profound and it has
[48:04] tremendous
[48:05] impact at least it should
[48:08] have tremendous impact in our lives
[48:10] ephesians
[48:12] chapter 1
[48:16] verses 1 through 17 we'll read this
[48:18] through quickly and
[48:19] we'll let you be seated
[48:24] paul an apostle of jesus christ by the
[48:26] will of god to the saints which are at
[48:28] ephesus so notice who this is to
[48:30] this is to saints and to the faithful in
[48:33] christ jesus so you get who it's too
[48:36] this isn't an address to the world to
[48:38] those outside of the faith really
[48:41] uh they're welcome to read it and if
[48:43] they read it and
[48:44] long to be that they can be good news
[48:47] you can be you can get included in this
[48:49] and have it speak to you today but i
[48:51] want you to understand
[48:52] he's speaking to people who are born
[48:54] again
[48:56] all right so it's to the faithful in
[49:00] christ jesus
[49:01] grace and this is an important word
[49:02] grace be to you
[49:04] and peace who to you from god
[49:08] our father our father and from the lord
[49:11] jesus christ all right verse 3
[49:14] blessed be the god and father of our
[49:15] lord jesus christ
[49:17] who hath blessed who us
[49:20] with how many all spiritual blessings in
[49:23] heavenly places in christ
[49:26] so to get these blessings you have to be
[49:28] in christ all right
[49:30] you're not entitled to them otherwise
[49:32] according as he now watch this these are
[49:34] some important verses
[49:36] according as he this is god hath chosen
[49:40] us in him before the foundation of the
[49:44] world
[49:44] here's why here's why he did it that we
[49:47] should be holy
[49:48] and without blame before him in love
[49:52] having predestinated us unto the
[49:54] adoption of children
[49:56] by jesus christ to himself according to
[49:58] the good pleasure
[50:00] of his will here's what it's going to
[50:03] accomplish
[50:04] to the praise of the glory of
[50:07] here's that word again his grace wherein
[50:10] he hath
[50:11] made us he hath made us by his grace
[50:14] hath made us accepted in the beloved
[50:18] now in whom we have this word is big
[50:23] redemption not just salvation
[50:27] the foolish virgin are saved from
[50:30] destruction
[50:32] but they're not born again the to so
[50:35] redemption
[50:36] is beyond basic salvation from
[50:39] destruction
[50:40] all right so so wherein he hath about
[50:43] all right verse 7 again in whom we have
[50:45] redemption through his blood
[50:48] the forgiveness of sins according to the
[50:50] riches of his grace
[50:52] wherein he hath abounded toward us this
[50:55] is the redeemed
[50:57] and all wisdom and prudence those are
[50:59] two big big big big words
[51:01] wisdom and prudence having made known
[51:04] unto us
[51:04] the mystery of his will by revelation
[51:08] according to his good pleasure which he
[51:10] hath purposed
[51:11] in himself now i'm sure that while
[51:15] you're
[51:15] included in all of this you should just
[51:17] be straight rejoicing because he's the
[51:20] one did it all
[51:22] you didn't really do anything you're
[51:23] just a beneficiary you're being
[51:25] it's being re you're you're getting the
[51:27] benefits of it see
[51:29] all right that in the dispensation
[51:33] of the fullness of times here's his
[51:35] grand scheme
[51:36] he might gather together in one
[51:40] all things in christ this is why he sent
[51:42] the prophets the priests the kings
[51:45] john jesus the disciples the holy ghost
[51:48] the ages the seals the prophet of this
[51:50] hour
[51:51] why did he do it the whole thing is one
[51:54] goal to gather everything
[51:56] in christ see because
[52:00] gathering everything in christ means
[52:02] expression
[52:04] you understand so god had all kinds of
[52:07] of characteristics in him unexpressed
[52:10] that's why he was lonely
[52:11] so his design was to gather it all in
[52:14] christ
[52:14] the elected son amen there's only one
[52:17] elected son
[52:18] remember it's not the man that comes
[52:20] predestinated it's a seed in him
[52:22] there's only one elected son that's
[52:24] jesus and i was in him
[52:26] before the foundation of the world so
[52:28] god is looking to express
[52:30] in christ in other words all the christ
[52:33] his entire family of of anointed
[52:37] amen remember when we say christ don't
[52:40] just limit it to
[52:40] jesus christ there's mrs jesus christ
[52:45] you understand all of the old testament
[52:47] were foreshadowing him
[52:49] all right and so we find then that he
[52:51] has a bride all right let's carry on
[52:57] verse 12 again that we
[53:01] should be to the praise of his glory who
[53:04] first trusted in christ
[53:06] in whom he also trusted after that you
[53:10] heard the word of truth the gospel of
[53:12] your salvation
[53:14] in whom also after have after that ye
[53:17] believed
[53:18] after ye were sealed with the holy
[53:20] spirit of promise
[53:22] it's after okay after you have believed
[53:25] you're sealed with the holy spirit of
[53:27] promise all right
[53:28] now how do you believe the holy spirit
[53:32] gives you a revelation amen
[53:35] all right now watch it's of revelation
[53:38] to you personally
[53:40] all right you accept it and you're
[53:42] sealed into the kingdom
[53:44] all right now watch all right verse 14
[53:47] which is the earnest the ceiling of our
[53:51] inheritance
[53:52] until the redemption of the purchased
[53:54] possession
[53:55] unto the praise of his glory wherefore i
[53:58] also
[53:59] after i heard of your faith in the lord
[54:01] jesus and love unto all the saints
[54:03] cease not to give thanks for you making
[54:05] mention of you in my prayers
[54:07] that the god of our lord jesus christ
[54:09] the father of glory may give unto you
[54:11] the spirit
[54:12] of wisdom and revelation and the
[54:15] knowledge of him he's got a purpose in
[54:17] this
[54:17] he's got a goal paul here was paul's
[54:20] desire
[54:21] concerning you say what paul feel about
[54:24] me here you go
[54:25] that he may give unto you the spirit of
[54:28] wisdom and revelation
[54:29] and the knowledge of him amen
[54:32] i'm going to break all that down there's
[54:34] really going to be a lesson an intensive
[54:36] deep dive lesson today and i want you to
[54:39] give me your undivided attention for
[54:41] about 60 minutes
[54:42] and we will i believe we can get through
[54:44] it father we thank you for your word
[54:46] we commit it to you i feel your nearness
[54:48] thank you for all the worship and
[54:50] singing
[54:51] i humble myself again i submit myself
[54:54] and surrender once more
[54:56] under your under your leadership in the
[54:59] name of jesus christ
[55:00] amen god bless you you can be seated
[55:11] now you'll just forgive me if i go
[55:13] quickly but i'm going to give you
[55:14] visuals
[55:15] so you'll hear it and see it all right
[55:18] all right now
[55:20] i want to emphasize a number of words
[55:24] and we we we told you to be
[55:28] pay careful attention to several words
[55:30] and that is this grace
[55:32] that is that there's a wisdom and there
[55:35] there's a knowledge
[55:36] and there's a prudence all right and so
[55:39] we want to focus now down on verse
[55:43] uh uh all right now i want to now i want
[55:45] to go back to the scripture
[55:48] that i used last week in first peter 1
[55:51] 13 first from the king james
[55:54] bible before the powerpoint brother matt
[55:57] yeah so we want to have the presenter up
[56:00] and go to first peter
[56:02] 1 and verse 13.
[56:05] amen i may have
[56:08] messed that up in the message i sent
[56:10] back so my apologies if so
[56:13] uh first peter 1 13 from the king james
[56:16] and then i want to read that same verse
[56:17] out of several other
[56:18] translations wherefore
[56:22] gird up the loins of your mind be sober
[56:25] and hope to the end here's that word
[56:28] again
[56:29] for the grace that is to be brought unto
[56:32] you
[56:33] at the revelation of jesus christ amen
[56:37] now i could go into other places to show
[56:39] you
[56:40] and prove to you that this is not just
[56:42] at his appearing in the sky
[56:44] all right because we're realizing that
[56:47] you're going to need a grace
[56:49] to get to that appearing in the sky and
[56:52] and the rapture isn't a lightning strike
[56:54] event it's a cycle of events
[56:57] and it's on now it's underway you're
[57:00] already being caught up
[57:02] into it amen all right that's that's
[57:05] what's now the proof of that is you're
[57:07] different from the world you live
[57:08] different think different
[57:09] you have a whole different world view of
[57:11] everything i
[57:13] i was saying to the west coast brothers
[57:15] and and a bible study
[57:17] uh yesterday or the day before i don't
[57:18] remember about how that
[57:20] you know when we when we look at the
[57:23] world
[57:24] and you know i i found it necessary to
[57:27] stop reading so many of the headlines
[57:29] because it's just too crazy
[57:32] and it causes me anxiety and literally
[57:34] you
[57:35] and i and i and i i like to stay
[57:37] informed i will occasionally just
[57:39] pull up headlines and just quickly to
[57:41] see if there's anything of interest
[57:42] usually there's not
[57:44] usually it's the same old stupid
[57:46] nonsense and perversions
[57:48] and sin and ungodliness and i just i
[57:51] don't even want to see that you say
[57:53] well but you're go you're going to miss
[57:54] out on the headlines well
[57:56] where do where do you get the news from
[57:58] i go to my bible now
[58:01] say well the bible isn't going to tell
[58:02] you the current headlines
[58:04] but it's going to tell me what's behind
[58:05] them it's going to tell me why
[58:08] they're there why it's happening i
[58:09] already know what's going to happen
[58:11] i know how it ends amen i know why it's
[58:14] here
[58:15] see i'd much rather know the why than
[58:18] the what
[58:19] and so i i know the end from the
[58:21] beginning
[58:22] so we we realized then that there is a
[58:26] a special grace that was to come at the
[58:29] end time
[58:30] at the revelation of jesus christ at the
[58:33] apocalypses
[58:34] at the uncovering at the when the mighty
[58:37] god is unveiled brother branham said
[58:39] he called it a rapturing faith but he
[58:41] also called it a rapturing grace
[58:44] and the headstone will come crying grace
[58:47] grace
[58:48] unto it this is a big word amen
[58:52] but now watch so now let me look at that
[58:56] from the
[58:56] from the new living translation first
[58:58] peter 1 13 from the nlt
[59:02] so prepare your mind see now the kjv
[59:06] said wherefore gird up
[59:08] the loins of your mind be sober and hope
[59:10] to the end
[59:11] the nlt says so prepare your minds for
[59:14] action and exercise self-control
[59:20] wait a minute i thought that there was
[59:22] this magical grace just gonna take over
[59:24] and everything would be fine
[59:26] there's a grace coming and you need to
[59:28] prepare to walk in it
[59:30] say well what is grace grace teaches us
[59:32] to deny ungodliness
[59:34] grace is what's coming to give you the
[59:36] desire in your heart to be different
[59:39] from the world
[59:40] but you still you're elected you've got
[59:42] a gene of god you've still got to be
[59:43] born again
[59:44] you've still got to surrender you've
[59:46] still got to have the holy ghost
[59:48] otherwise the seed never comes to life
[59:50] you understand you never
[59:52] produce a crop for the lord and if i
[59:54] can't produce a crop for him then
[59:56] lord just carry me on home because i
[59:58] that's the whole reason i'm here that's
[59:59] what makes it worth it
[1:00:01] that i can grow a crop here for the lord
[1:00:03] jesus
[1:00:05] so prepare your minds for action
[1:00:09] and exercise self-control when
[1:00:13] at the appearing of this grace when is
[1:00:15] that coming
[1:00:16] at the revelation at the uh at the
[1:00:18] unveiling of god
[1:00:19] when we had the mighty god unveiled do
[1:00:22] we
[1:00:23] then prepare your minds for action
[1:00:26] and exercise self-control you're not
[1:00:29] here to just gain theology
[1:00:33] i'm not here preaching to give you
[1:00:35] better i say this all the time
[1:00:37] not trying to give you better theology
[1:00:39] than the baptist we have better theology
[1:00:41] than they do because we have the full
[1:00:42] word back restored
[1:00:44] but it's supposed to do something in
[1:00:46] your life it's supposed to
[1:00:47] change you you're not just supposed to
[1:00:50] say amen
[1:00:51] how about we become an amen
[1:00:57] prepare your minds for action and
[1:01:00] exercise self-control put all your hope
[1:01:03] in the gracious salvation

[1:03:43] satan can't force his way on you anymore
[1:03:46] since that's happened to you
[1:03:48] now that now that you've you you having
[1:03:51] put out of the way
[1:03:52] once and for all everything that would
[1:03:54] impede the free action of your mind
[1:03:57] be calm and collected in spirit
[1:04:01] and set your hope perfectly holy
[1:04:04] and unchangeably without doubt and
[1:04:07] despondency
[1:04:09] upon the grace that is being brought to
[1:04:11] you
[1:04:12] upon the occasion of the revelation of
[1:04:15] jesus christ
[1:04:18] so god has done something
[1:04:21] great in this hour now it's your turn
[1:04:26] you're to be christ to the world he's
[1:04:29] reconciling
[1:04:31] all things in christ
[1:04:34] that means your opinions got to go out
[1:04:37] the door
[1:04:38] your desires got to go out the door how
[1:04:40] you want to live lucy goosey
[1:04:43] and call yourself a message believer
[1:04:45] that's got to go
[1:04:47] he's that's not why he sent the message
[1:04:49] to leave you like that
[1:04:50] and then let you just live that old that
[1:04:53] old
[1:04:54] half half-world way that old half-world
[1:04:58] way
[1:04:58] and then somehow the grace is going to
[1:05:00] pull me across the line anyway
[1:05:02] you know i i'm not here to deny election
[1:05:05] but i don't want to get pulled and drug
[1:05:06] across the line i'd like to be
[1:05:08] upright and running when i cross the
[1:05:12] line
[1:05:14] so you live as an underachiever if you
[1:05:16] want to but as for me and my house we're
[1:05:18] going to serve the lord
[1:05:19] and i want to have my mind sober and
[1:05:21] prepared in all things
[1:05:23] for spiritual warfare i want to
[1:05:25] accomplish some things i want to beat
[1:05:27] the devil
[1:05:28] [Music]
[1:05:30] i want to be a king over him and over
[1:05:31] the flesh and over sinning over the
[1:05:32] world
[1:05:33] i'm told i can be but it's up to me
[1:05:41] so we go back now to ephesians chapter
[1:05:43] one and let's look at four and seven
[1:05:45] again
[1:05:46] brother matt in in the king james
[1:05:48] ephesians one four and 7
[1:05:51] 4-7 ephesians 1 4-7 according as he hath
[1:05:54] chosen us
[1:05:55] catch this now according as he hath
[1:05:57] chosen us
[1:05:59] in him before the foundation of the
[1:06:00] world
[1:06:02] that we should be holy and without blame
[1:06:05] before him in love
[1:06:06] having predestinated us into the
[1:06:08] adoption of children by jesus christ to
[1:06:10] himself according to the good pleasure
[1:06:12] of his will
[1:06:13] to the praise of his glory of his grace
[1:06:15] wherein he hath made us
[1:06:17] accepted in the beloved in whom we have
[1:06:18] redemption through his blood
[1:06:20] the forgiveness of sins according to the
[1:06:22] riches of his grace
[1:06:24] so brother branham picks picks up this
[1:06:27] angle not necessarily that those verses
[1:06:30] but this angle of election and
[1:06:33] god's choosing and god's purpose
[1:06:36] in election god's purpose in redemption
[1:06:40] and i can tell you this say well tell me
[1:06:44] what it is
[1:06:44] first let me tell you what it's not and
[1:06:46] by contrast you'll get a
[1:06:47] you'll start to get an idea where i'm
[1:06:49] going jesus did not come to save the
[1:06:52] world
[1:06:53] amen he came to die for the sins of the
[1:06:57] whole world
[1:06:58] so that everybody could have a
[1:07:00] legitimate opportunity to
[1:07:02] be at least be saved from destruction
[1:07:05] but as far as redemption he came to save
[1:07:08] his own
[1:07:09] whom the father gave him he says
[1:07:13] thine they were and thou gave us them me
[1:07:15] and i've lost
[1:07:16] none of them and i can tell you there
[1:07:18] won't be one empty chair at that table
[1:07:21] there also won't be one extra placemat
[1:07:23] at that table
[1:07:25] amen this is god's doing and it's
[1:07:28] beautiful in our sight
[1:07:30] and so so when we think about it friends
[1:07:33] brother branham talks about how that
[1:07:35] it's got to be christ it's got to be the
[1:07:37] revelation of the spirit you can't save
[1:07:40] yourself
[1:07:40] and you can't decide to be saved
[1:07:44] even basic salvation god has to give you
[1:07:46] an
[1:07:47] opportunity and he might do that in a
[1:07:50] church
[1:07:51] he might he might do that he's only
[1:07:54] obligated to do it once
[1:07:56] he's only obligated to call a man one
[1:07:58] time that's all he's obligated to be
[1:08:00] fair
[1:08:02] see he might do that in a church hearing
[1:08:04] a sermon
[1:08:05] he might do it in your vehicle playing a
[1:08:08] gospel tune
[1:08:10] he might do it with you walking through
[1:08:13] the woods and seeing a tree and god just
[1:08:15] reveal himself to you in nature
[1:08:18] or the sun will rise up and declare his
[1:08:20] glory and you'll for a moment catch
[1:08:22] there must be and then you'll decide no
[1:08:24] no and you'll go on about your way and
[1:08:26] he's never
[1:08:27] obligated to call you again on the dead
[1:08:29] judgment he'll be justified
[1:08:31] in denying you entering see
[1:08:35] he and so so we so brother branham talks
[1:08:38] about this he's he talks about two
[1:08:39] different fellows this is in
[1:08:41] the message a true sign that's
[1:08:43] overlooked i don't have it in my
[1:08:44] powerpoint so to stand by
[1:08:45] matt so and i'm not going to read it all
[1:08:48] that's why i didn't put it in i'm not
[1:08:49] going to read it all
[1:08:50] and so in a true sign overlooked brother
[1:08:52] branham talks about
[1:08:53] two different men and he tells a story
[1:08:56] and he he tells about both of these men
[1:08:59] had terrible smoking habits
[1:09:01] and brother branham is actually relating
[1:09:03] a story how that he was in a
[1:09:05] like a little fellowship kind of like
[1:09:06] reminded me of us
[1:09:08] out here in the fellowship hall or maybe
[1:09:09] it's a you know when we're having a
[1:09:11] bible study or whatever
[1:09:12] sitting around talking because some man
[1:09:15] pipes up and says you know brother bill
[1:09:17] that that cigarette demon is hard to
[1:09:19] defeat and brother branham said
[1:09:21] you better believe it he said because
[1:09:23] it's a devil
[1:09:25] and he said it takes the grace of god he
[1:09:27] said now watch
[1:09:28] he said i knew two men one time and both
[1:09:31] of them that's his words
[1:09:33] both of them wanted to be men of god see
[1:09:37] and one of them he says brother brown
[1:09:39] starts talking about as soon as i led
[1:09:41] him to christ
[1:09:43] and he said he went back home and he
[1:09:46] said i
[1:09:47] brother branham had never said anything
[1:09:49] to him about the cigarettes
[1:09:50] had never showed him in the bible that
[1:09:52] it was wrong
[1:09:53] and that man was a chain smoker five six
[1:09:56] packs a day said he would sit down and
[1:09:57] just light one off of another and all
[1:09:58] day long go through five or six packs
[1:10:01] go bankrupt today doing that and so
[1:10:04] and so he and so he says he says but
[1:10:07] when he went to
[1:10:08] light that first cigarette sitting in
[1:10:10] his same old chair in the same old
[1:10:12] living room
[1:10:12] he said somehow he just couldn't make
[1:10:14] himself do it and he said what's wrong
[1:10:17] he didn't even know it was wrong brother
[1:10:19] branham hadn't even said a word about it
[1:10:21] it took him nowhere in the scripture but
[1:10:23] somehow and he said he just got up
[1:10:25] and he walked over to his old potbelly
[1:10:27] stove and he pitched all those smokes in
[1:10:29] there and they went up in flames
[1:10:31] and he said he's never smoked a day
[1:10:32] since and he's a servant of the lord
[1:10:36] and then he gives a contrasting story
[1:10:38] says the other fellow
[1:10:40] he also wanted to become a christian and
[1:10:43] watch this watch how brother rem says it
[1:10:45] he tried his best
[1:10:49] he cried out to the lord he quit them
[1:10:53] quit smoking for two or three weeks
[1:10:56] and when he come to his self in that
[1:10:58] condition
[1:11:00] what condition not delivered
[1:11:03] not really born again all he did was
[1:11:06] make a confession
[1:11:08] and all he's doing is trying to be a
[1:11:09] better person
[1:11:11] see the holy ghost isn't hard to get but
[1:11:13] if you're not willing to surrender every
[1:11:15] grain of who you are
[1:11:16] he's never going to come in and seal
[1:11:17] that vessel you understand
[1:11:19] you've when you come to that's why it's
[1:11:21] not hard to get and it doesn't take you
[1:11:23] don't got to fast 10 days or 40 days or
[1:11:24] any days or any hours
[1:11:26] in five minutes you could walk up here
[1:11:28] and completely surrender your entire
[1:11:30] life and give it over to christ
[1:11:32] and mean it from your heart and the lord
[1:11:33] who sees your heart knows it's real and
[1:11:35] he'll give you the holy ghost
[1:11:36] immediately on the spot that's his
[1:11:38] promise
[1:11:39] and he's never broken a promise but this
[1:11:42] man
[1:11:42] it becomes obvious it becomes apparent
[1:11:44] evidently
[1:11:46] he didn't ever do that because you can't
[1:11:48] make god lie
[1:11:51] right you know you can't make god lie
[1:11:54] and so so we find that that brother
[1:11:57] branham says
[1:11:59] you know he he came to himself in that
[1:12:01] condition
[1:12:02] he went out of his mind he said when he
[1:12:05] come to himself he found himself out in
[1:12:06] the backyard beating his head
[1:12:08] on a piece of tin and he said he run in
[1:12:11] the house real quick and grabbed his
[1:12:12] cigarettes and smoked a pack before he
[1:12:14] left the house that evening just one
[1:12:15] right after the other one right after
[1:12:17] the other
[1:12:18] and brother branham says see one was
[1:12:21] called
[1:12:23] amen and he quotes the scripture no man
[1:12:26] can come to me except my father draws
[1:12:28] him and all the father has given me will
[1:12:29] come to me
[1:12:30] what did the warning mean it was life to
[1:12:33] one he
[1:12:34] saw it you can't see it unless god
[1:12:37] reveals it
[1:12:38] [Music]
[1:12:39] see it's hid here's another scripture
[1:12:43] it's hid from the eyes of the wise and
[1:12:45] prudent and revealed to babes
[1:12:47] such as would learn that's right see the
[1:12:50] hour was close at hand
[1:12:52] you know you you you've got to throw
[1:12:54] down this
[1:12:55] this denominational church age
[1:12:59] man-made credo ideology that everybody
[1:13:03] can just come
[1:13:04] up and make a decision for jesus and i'm
[1:13:06] going to heaven
[1:13:07] that's not true you're wrong no no
[1:13:11] you're wrong that's not true that's
[1:13:14] never been true
[1:13:15] it's whom god calls and then you're
[1:13:17] given an opportunity
[1:13:19] see you can't just i remember years ago
[1:13:22] one of my buddies in a church i was just
[1:13:24] 14
[1:13:25] 15 years old myself and and i was
[1:13:27] already holding public bible studies at
[1:13:29] that time
[1:13:30] and teaching sunday school and and i
[1:13:32] spoke to him in the parking lot one day
[1:13:34] and i said
[1:13:35] hey pal i won't call his name i said you
[1:13:38] know you you need to give your heart to
[1:13:39] the lord because i knew he wasn't a
[1:13:40] christian i said you need to give your
[1:13:41] heart to the lord
[1:13:42] the rapture's coming soon and he said
[1:13:44] and he's walking into church
[1:13:46] and he came every service he never
[1:13:49] missed church
[1:13:50] that wasn't it that wasn't the problem
[1:13:52] and he's walking into church and i said
[1:13:54] it to him as he's walking in i said you
[1:13:55] need to give your heart to the lord
[1:13:57] and he said oh that's all right he said
[1:13:58] i'll just say jesus forgive me my sins
[1:14:00] and i'm fine
[1:14:02] and as a 14 15 year old boy i knew
[1:14:04] that's not right
[1:14:06] that can't be true it can't work like
[1:14:08] that
[1:14:09] and as i begin to study the scripture i
[1:14:11] realize it doesn't work like that
[1:14:13] it's never worked like that that's why
[1:14:16] if the lord
[1:14:16] calls upon your heart whatever you do
[1:14:19] accept it
[1:14:20] don't wait he's not obligated to ever
[1:14:23] call you a second time
[1:14:25] see and so he goes back in
[1:14:29] in his story about you know moses and
[1:14:32] and how his father
[1:14:33] amram and joseph they weren't afraid of
[1:14:35] the king's commandment they weren't
[1:14:36] afraid of the crocodiles
[1:14:38] see and brother branham says i want us
[1:14:40] it's all about election
[1:14:42] they noticed that he was a special child
[1:14:44] see brother branham says
[1:14:46] it's all about that it's just like that
[1:14:48] that that
[1:14:49] say you mean you mean there's special
[1:14:51] people in the world
[1:14:52] i'm sorry if that wrankles you but yes
[1:14:55] yes there are special people what are
[1:14:58] they called the elect lady
[1:15:00] they were in christ before the
[1:15:01] foundation of the world
[1:15:03] they're predestinated not to fall
[1:15:06] hallelujah
[1:15:07] see and he says i want to say this while
[1:15:11] i'm
[1:15:11] speaking of it it's not him that willeth
[1:15:13] or him that runneth
[1:15:14] it's god that showeth mercy that's right
[1:15:17] it's god
[1:15:18] so today i'm going to read you this so
[1:15:20] today
[1:15:21] let this sink deep if today
[1:15:25] god has called you and you separated
[1:15:27] yourself from the things of the world
[1:15:29] and the glorious power of god has
[1:15:31] sanctified you from them things
[1:15:33] here's the other half of it jd you
[1:15:36] should be
[1:15:36] the happiest person in the world
[1:15:40] because there was millions that would do
[1:15:42] it if they could
[1:15:44] but they can't it's not for them
[1:15:47] to have it this is the day watch now
[1:15:50] watch now you should be that happy
[1:15:53] because there'd be
[1:15:54] millions who would love to have the
[1:15:56] opportunity you have
[1:15:57] by your election and so if god has
[1:16:01] allowed you to see this word you ought
[1:16:03] to be the happiest person
[1:16:05] in the world see
[1:16:10] say what about my friends who don't who
[1:16:12] aren't elected god
[1:16:13] god offers them salvation there'll be
[1:16:16] millions of people outside the city who
[1:16:18] never believe the message the foolish
[1:16:19] virgin
[1:16:20] go through the tribulation for their sin
[1:16:23] of unbelief
[1:16:24] and rejecting the message that's a
[1:16:26] direct statement
[1:16:28] from the from the tape they go that's it
[1:16:30] out of the seventh seal they go through
[1:16:32] the tribulation
[1:16:33] for their sin of unbelief and rejecting
[1:16:35] the message but they'll they won't be in
[1:16:37] the millennium but they'll be there
[1:16:38] at the great white throne they're
[1:16:39] granted eternal life
[1:16:42] here to tell you something friends you
[1:16:44] people are going to get granted eternal
[1:16:45] life just because of their attitude
[1:16:46] toward god's family
[1:16:48] why does it work like that because it
[1:16:50] was christ in his family
[1:16:52] and they were honoring christ
[1:16:56] see they couldn't quite get it seeing it
[1:16:58] in nature they couldn't quite get it
[1:17:00] hearing a preached sermon
[1:17:01] but they could they could see it in
[1:17:03] another human and and they
[1:17:05] and and their heart response not a
[1:17:08] balanced scale
[1:17:09] of goods and you got 962 good deeds and
[1:17:12] only 747 bad deeds so you get to come in
[1:17:15] it's not
[1:17:16] not a balanced scale you can't go you
[1:17:18] can't get eternal life like that
[1:17:20] but it was their heart response when
[1:17:22] they were confronted by the word in
[1:17:24] whatever way it came
[1:17:26] i'm glad god's merciful that way i'm
[1:17:28] glad he's got it that way
[1:17:30] but i also want to be vigilant i want to
[1:17:32] be sober and i want to prepare my mind
[1:17:34] to say i'm elected
[1:17:36] and i see it and now i have a i have a
[1:17:38] duty
[1:17:39] to become christ to the world
[1:17:42] [Music]
[1:17:43] not just languish in my election and
[1:17:46] languish in my
[1:17:47] superior understanding of my r by
[1:17:50] revelation
[1:17:51] it's not about that
[1:17:54] if this church wants to
[1:17:57] have that i can promise you
[1:18:00] you will not see the power of god
[1:18:04] operating very very much
[1:18:07] not in a not to say not in a mighty way
[1:18:09] not hardly at all
[1:18:11] but if we want to see the power of god
[1:18:15] if we want to have life-changing
[1:18:18] power coming in if we want to see our
[1:18:20] children if we want to see the holy
[1:18:22] ghost
[1:18:22] if we want to see angels i'm here to
[1:18:24] tell you they'll be sober
[1:18:27] get your mind ready be prepared have
[1:18:29] self-control
[1:18:30] let the mind which was in christ be in
[1:18:32] you allow
[1:18:34] permit let the word dwell in you
[1:18:38] richly amen amen
[1:18:42] see it's in you by a seed gene of god
[1:18:44] everything you have needed for raptures
[1:18:45] in you
[1:18:46] see but it's in a seed form the whole
[1:18:48] purpose of of the holy ghost
[1:18:51] having freedom in your life is to bring
[1:18:52] those seeds to fruition
[1:18:55] so that you actually grow the crop in
[1:18:58] your life
[1:18:59] as brother jd was speaking this morning
[1:19:01] about operation of gifts
[1:19:03] see so we want to see the power of god
[1:19:06] you know it's not about praying god give
[1:19:08] me a gift that i wasn't born with but
[1:19:10] it's about god i want to see the gifts
[1:19:12] in operation
[1:19:13] i want to see the power of god moving in
[1:19:15] this church let me do my part
[1:19:18] and if there's a gift lying there then
[1:19:19] use it lord see
[1:19:23] but brother branham talks about you know
[1:19:24] those nine spiritual gifts he
[1:19:26] starts talking about anybody with the
[1:19:27] holy ghost's subject any one of those
[1:19:30] see so don't don't don't say well i'm
[1:19:33] just a
[1:19:33] i'm just a housewife i'm just a farmer
[1:19:35] i'm just a simple person don't despise
[1:19:37] the day of small things
[1:19:39] little as much if god is in it
[1:19:42] see and so so
[1:19:45] brother branham talks about people he
[1:19:48] said they run all over the place and
[1:19:49] make a whole lot of noise and he said
[1:19:50] they want the power of god when really
[1:19:52] he said they don't even know what the
[1:19:53] power of god is
[1:19:55] see see they run all over and make a
[1:19:57] whole lot of noise
[1:19:59] he said but the real power of god is
[1:20:01] surrendering your life and letting
[1:20:04] christ be all in all he said then
[1:20:08] he said then you have more power with
[1:20:11] god
[1:20:12] than the man that runs around making a
[1:20:14] lot of noise because you've learned to
[1:20:15] control yourself
[1:20:18] you've learned to let the holy spirit
[1:20:21] guide your life
[1:20:23] you've let you've let the brothers
[1:20:25] you've let the holy spirit
[1:20:27] tell you you shouldn't go there
[1:20:30] you shouldn't do that sisters stand in
[1:20:33] their closet
[1:20:34] deciding what to wear you you allow the
[1:20:37] holy spirit to go that
[1:20:38] first of all shouldn't even be in your
[1:20:40] closet much less on your body
[1:20:44] take that and burn it and go replace it
[1:20:47] with something that
[1:20:48] demonstrates god being all in all in
[1:20:51] christ in his family see
[1:20:55] brother branham said if you're not gonna
[1:20:56] live like a christian then please stop
[1:20:58] calling yourself that
[1:21:00] because you only make a disgrace and you
[1:21:02] only bring shame on the name of the lord
[1:21:05] if if the people only see in your life
[1:21:07] that you're no more than a
[1:21:08] denominational person then how are you
[1:21:10] going to witness to them about a message
[1:21:12] you're not in even any way different you
[1:21:15] know you say well i go to church so do
[1:21:17] they
[1:21:18] well we got missionary programs so do
[1:21:19] they well but i mean they got a they got
[1:21:22] a preacher that preached out of the
[1:21:23] bible
[1:21:24] so do they you know well they they
[1:21:27] they listen to gospel i listen to god's
[1:21:29] music so do they
[1:21:30] but i i cry tears and i pray to jesus so
[1:21:33] do they
[1:21:35] there's got to be something beyond that
[1:21:37] that separates you from the world
[1:21:40] see now let me
[1:21:43] show you where we have come to because
[1:21:46] i've read to you
[1:21:48] and i've challenged you to believe that
[1:21:50] we have arrived at the time of first
[1:21:52] peter 1 13 that we have arrived at the
[1:21:54] time
[1:21:55] of the revelation of jesus christ and
[1:21:58] this grace
[1:21:59] and this wisdom and this knowledge is
[1:22:02] supposed to be operating in you we're
[1:22:04] going to talk about it and break it down
[1:22:05] a little further
[1:22:07] so now watch what brother branham says
[1:22:09] concerning
[1:22:10] where we are now versus where man-made
[1:22:14] systems are in the ages of the church
[1:22:17] all right remember the church now at
[1:22:19] this point the church is no longer his
[1:22:20] mouthpiece remember that
[1:22:22] a bride was called out of the church you
[1:22:24] understand
[1:22:25] so so the age of of god dealing in the
[1:22:28] church
[1:22:29] is over that happened through seven ages
[1:22:31] and we're still in the seventh and last
[1:22:32] church age because
[1:22:33] the bride leaves the seventh one and
[1:22:35] goes into rapture
[1:22:36] so i'm not talking about the historical
[1:22:38] church age i'm talking about the age
[1:22:40] when god dealt in the church
[1:22:42] she put christ out she's no longer his
[1:22:46] mouthpiece well how would she be if she
[1:22:48] put him out
[1:22:49] she put him out and so now christ
[1:22:53] through a prophet sends a message into
[1:22:55] the earth to his elect lady
[1:22:57] don't stay in the church they're no
[1:22:59] longer my mouthpiece
[1:23:00] come out of her my people amen
[1:23:04] and now god now christ misses jesus
[1:23:07] christ as operating in the world do you
[1:23:09] understand that
[1:23:11] so brother branham says here so today
[1:23:13] let this sink in deep
[1:23:14] today god has called you and you
[1:23:16] separated yourself from the things of
[1:23:18] the world and the glorious
[1:23:20] power of god has sanctified you from
[1:23:23] them things
[1:23:24] you should be the happiest person in the
[1:23:26] world there was millions that would do
[1:23:28] it if they could but they can't it's not
[1:23:30] for them to have it
[1:23:32] why why why brother branham why why tell
[1:23:34] me why please tell me why okay
[1:23:36] you ready this is the day when the
[1:23:39] church is called
[1:23:40] out separated here's a direct quote
[1:23:44] it's different what it used to be
[1:23:48] it's different what it used to be back
[1:23:50] in the ages when he winked at a lot of
[1:23:52] their ignorance they didn't even have to
[1:23:53] have all the doctrine correct
[1:23:57] that's why luther could smoke a pipe and
[1:23:59] drink beer
[1:24:00] that's why i mean that's why john wesley
[1:24:02] could preach
[1:24:03] a trinitarian a doctrine of demons
[1:24:06] trinitarian doctrine is a doctrine of
[1:24:07] demons
[1:24:09] that's three unclean spirits like frogs
[1:24:11] in the book of revelation and yet he was
[1:24:12] the
[1:24:13] he was the church age messenger why
[1:24:14] because christ was back there
[1:24:16] interceding they didn't know what he
[1:24:18] fully looked like he hadn't come out yet
[1:24:21] he's back in the eternity he's
[1:24:22] interceding but in this hour
[1:24:24] he has stepped forward and the mighty
[1:24:26] god is unveiled and we see him
[1:24:28] wow so i i don't i don't that was wrong
[1:24:32] but you forgave and you winked at it but
[1:24:34] now today
[1:24:34] you've called me to be separate from
[1:24:36] that
[1:24:38] you've called me to be a different kind
[1:24:39] of a person
[1:24:41] i'm to come up to a higher level
[1:24:44] and to live above denominational
[1:24:47] christianity
[1:24:49] i'm different than that i'm beyond that
[1:24:52] amen so
[1:24:56] you see that and this is from the
[1:24:58] message
[1:25:00] so significant from the message a true
[1:25:03] sign that's overlooked and actually
[1:25:07] this is why the world is in the
[1:25:09] condition it's in
[1:25:11] because the world has failed to realize
[1:25:14] this massive point
[1:25:17] what what point that it's different than
[1:25:19] it used to be
[1:25:21] now you have acts 17 in parallel where
[1:25:24] paul
[1:25:24] said to those jews hey there was a time
[1:25:26] he winked at your ignorance you brought
[1:25:28] all those
[1:25:29] blood of bulls and goats and god
[1:25:30] accepted it it was a substitute he took
[1:25:33] it
[1:25:33] okay but that's done
[1:25:36] it's different now now the lamb of god
[1:25:40] has come and shed
[1:25:41] his blood and now the holy ghost is
[1:25:43] coming you've got to repent
[1:25:45] you've got to come to the fullness of
[1:25:47] the word you've got to repent of that
[1:25:48] old thinking you can't come under those
[1:25:50] symbols god won't honor well it was 1600
[1:25:53] i don't care if it was 1600 years
[1:25:55] of sacrifice it could have been 16
[1:25:57] million years of sacrifice
[1:25:58] but it was over and it wasn't coming
[1:26:01] back
[1:26:03] you understand and so where this is what
[1:26:05] the world has
[1:26:06] failed to realize this massive point
[1:26:08] that we have now
[1:26:09] paralleled acts 17 again we've come back
[1:26:12] to the full word
[1:26:13] the bright age has returned to the
[1:26:16] church
[1:26:18] it's returned that's what paul had
[1:26:21] you say is that a church age that bright
[1:26:23] age isn't a church age it's a special
[1:26:25] time within an age
[1:26:27] you understand this was the time even
[1:26:29] before the church ages started 1853
[1:26:32] the church was perfect only when it when
[1:26:35] it slips away
[1:26:36] now brother branham picks it up from
[1:26:37] there and starts recording ages
[1:26:40] see but the the the jerusalem church
[1:26:43] didn't begin in 1853
[1:26:45] you understand for two decades they went
[1:26:47] perfectly in line with the word of god
[1:26:49] and all the apostles died off
[1:26:51] and went away john is the last one he
[1:26:53] comes back from the isle of patmos with
[1:26:54] a book locked up in mystery and
[1:26:56] symbolism and and no one really
[1:26:58] understands what it all means
[1:27:00] and and even things john forbidden to
[1:27:02] write why because that seed had to go
[1:27:04] into the ground
[1:27:05] but part of the return of the alpha
[1:27:08] was the return of the pure word
[1:27:11] so we're in the brag time the bride
[1:27:14] age the pure word and the word
[1:27:18] only the pure word and the pure word
[1:27:20] only
[1:27:21] no more can you find redemption and
[1:27:25] a mongrelized word come out of her my
[1:27:28] people this is where the holy ghost is
[1:27:31] this is where the token seals
[1:27:35] see so it was so
[1:27:38] so it was a true sign that was
[1:27:40] overlooked in our day what sign brother
[1:27:42] jason
[1:27:43] the sign that elijah the prophet would
[1:27:45] forerun the second coming of christ
[1:27:48] just as we saw in his first coming a
[1:27:50] prophet whose scriptural mission was to
[1:27:53] call a bride out of a church
[1:27:55] in these last days and to reestablish a
[1:27:58] separated people come on friends a
[1:28:01] separated people
[1:28:03] are people caught up in the cycle of the
[1:28:05] rapture of people who
[1:28:06] pass from death into token life of
[1:28:08] people who are standing
[1:28:09] in the perfection of the word of people
[1:28:11] preparing for liftoff
[1:28:14] [Applause]
[1:28:15] hallelujah
[1:28:16] [Music]
[1:28:19] so he says all right um matthew give me
[1:28:21] again i
[1:28:22] i might get to that powerpoint
[1:28:26] so ephesians 1 let's look at 7-10
[1:28:34] if i don't get it today we'll get it
[1:28:35] next time
[1:28:39] so ephesians 1 7-10
[1:28:42] verse 7 in whom we have redemption
[1:28:44] through his blood
[1:28:45] the forgiveness of sins now you
[1:28:47] understand now you understand
[1:28:49] why john would say if we walk in the
[1:28:52] light
[1:28:53] as he's in the light the we have
[1:28:56] fellowship one with another why because
[1:28:58] we're all in same family
[1:29:00] we've all got the holy ghost if we walk
[1:29:02] in the light
[1:29:03] as he's in the light then we have
[1:29:06] fellowship one with another
[1:29:07] and the blood of jesus cleanses us from
[1:29:10] all sin
[1:29:12] see so people who have not been born
[1:29:14] again of the spirit of god
[1:29:16] they might have a justif a justified
[1:29:18] state
[1:29:19] which is fine justification is wonderful
[1:29:21] but it only remits your past sins i
[1:29:23] don't help you in the future
[1:29:25] you understand it still doesn't make you
[1:29:26] born again it just simply god forgave
[1:29:27] you of all your sins because you asked
[1:29:29] him to and he was faithful and did it
[1:29:31] but what about tomorrow when you sin
[1:29:32] again
[1:29:34] see well i say well then what's the
[1:29:35] advantage of the holy ghost because when
[1:29:37] i got the holy ghost
[1:29:38] when tomorrow when i make another
[1:29:40] mistake i've got a blood speaking for me
[1:29:42] he didn't mean to do it he didn't mean
[1:29:44] to do it lord put it on my account put
[1:29:46] on my account he's my son he didn't mean
[1:29:47] to do it
[1:29:48] and if i and if i go the next week and
[1:29:49] make another mistake he didn't mean to
[1:29:51] do it lord he didn't mean father forgive
[1:29:52] him father forgive him he didn't mean to
[1:29:53] do it
[1:29:54] hallelujah that's what the blood of
[1:29:56] christ does for me
[1:29:58] the blood speaks for me hallelujah
[1:30:04] in whom we have redemption through his
[1:30:05] blood the forgiveness of sins according
[1:30:07] to the riches of his grace
[1:30:10] wherein he has abounded toward us in all
[1:30:12] wisdom and prudence
[1:30:13] there's those two words wisdom and
[1:30:15] prudence going to look at them
[1:30:17] having made known unto us the mystery of
[1:30:19] his will
[1:30:21] according to his good pleasure with he
[1:30:22] which has purposed in himself that in
[1:30:24] the dispensation of the fullness of
[1:30:26] times
[1:30:27] here it is here's our goal here's what
[1:30:29] he's doing he might gather together in
[1:30:32] one all things in christ
[1:30:34] in other words that i might have a a
[1:30:36] family of christ's
[1:30:38] throughout the earth amen to take in a
[1:30:40] rapture
[1:30:42] amen both which are in heaven and which
[1:30:45] are on earth
[1:30:46] even in him so
[1:30:50] when we look at god's grace here's
[1:30:52] here's here's here so we got these three
[1:30:54] words his grace and his wisdom
[1:30:55] all right and his understanding
[1:30:59] all right so grace is given and this is
[1:31:02] an important point
[1:31:03] one of the advantages of his grace
[1:31:07] is it's given to enable believers to
[1:31:10] understand his will
[1:31:13] see people go to church and join a
[1:31:16] church but they
[1:31:17] they don't they can't really change
[1:31:19] their life to become pleasing to him
[1:31:21] because first of all they don't even
[1:31:23] they don't even know what ali said and
[1:31:24] they won't get told everything he said
[1:31:26] from the pulpit
[1:31:28] and even if they do come here and hear
[1:31:30] it they
[1:31:31] they still can't they still don't get it
[1:31:34] unless his grace comes upon you
[1:31:38] and you understand the nature behind the
[1:31:41] commandment
[1:31:42] jesus said take my yoke upon you
[1:31:46] for my my burden is light
[1:31:50] my yoke is easy it's not hard to do you
[1:31:54] actually don't even have to do anything
[1:31:55] just get converted and it lives through
[1:31:58] you say what
[1:32:01] what do i do how do i how do i
[1:32:03] strengthen that well there's a way the
[1:32:04] holy ghost in you feeds on the word
[1:32:06] so get in your bible listen to the tapes
[1:32:09] come to church have fellowship
[1:32:10] these are the ways we strengthen
[1:32:12] ourselves
[1:32:14] you understand if you want the power of
[1:32:17] god moving freely
[1:32:19] see and so grace is given
[1:32:22] to believers to enable them to
[1:32:25] understand
[1:32:26] his will so it comes from
[1:32:29] god as a divine wisdom
[1:32:33] and an understanding that's how this
[1:32:36] great grace
[1:32:38] that's how it's meted out to you that's
[1:32:40] the form it comes in
[1:32:42] when it comes upon you it's not just a
[1:32:45] fuzzy feeling
[1:32:47] when this grace when the mighty god is
[1:32:49] revealed to you
[1:32:51] it gives you a divine wisdom and a
[1:32:54] divine
[1:32:54] understanding and paul speaks of this
[1:32:57] word wisdom it's sophia
[1:32:59] he talks about it on in verse 17. he go
[1:33:02] he talks about it in chapter three of
[1:33:03] ephesians
[1:33:04] he goes into colossians talks about in
[1:33:06] chapter one chapter two chapter
[1:33:08] three chapter four this this wisdom
[1:33:11] in other words this wisdom is the
[1:33:13] objective
[1:33:14] insight into the true nature of god's
[1:33:18] revelation in other words it's
[1:33:20] it's objective it's unbiased
[1:33:23] it's not contaminated by your own
[1:33:25] thinking anymore not even your own
[1:33:27] thinking it has nothing to do with
[1:33:29] denominationalism you've given up your
[1:33:31] ideology of
[1:33:32] what you think god is this wisdom that
[1:33:35] god gives you
[1:33:36] is an unbiased it is an it's independent
[1:33:39] from all man-made theology thanks
[1:33:42] be to god that's what the grace
[1:33:46] of our lord jesus christ has given me
[1:33:50] it gave me a wisdom to understand his
[1:33:54] nature
[1:33:55] to understand the nature of god's
[1:33:58] revelation
[1:33:59] and this word understanding that paul
[1:34:01] speaks of literally is the personal
[1:34:04] apprehending of it so so that believers
[1:34:07] are able to
[1:34:08] grasp the divine purpose
[1:34:11] of the ages so you understand what
[1:34:15] happened and why it happened
[1:34:18] the world even if you tell it to them
[1:34:19] can look on it as just history
[1:34:22] but you get wow i understand why the
[1:34:26] history
[1:34:27] well tell me do tell well because
[1:34:30] see they had a perfect word and then but
[1:34:33] that seed had to go into the ground
[1:34:34] because remember jesus said that except
[1:34:36] the corn of wheat died about his loan so
[1:34:38] that seed had to fall i get it now wow
[1:34:40] no wonder
[1:34:41] no wonder it had to fall it had to go
[1:34:43] down through the dark ages
[1:34:44] well then what's this message about well
[1:34:46] in the bible god said that would happen
[1:34:48] and then he would restore it all back
[1:34:51] and the end would come back to the
[1:34:52] beginning
[1:34:53] and we'd go in a rapture i get it
[1:34:56] i get it say well i don't know about a
[1:34:59] prophet then you cut yourself off from
[1:35:01] being able to get it
[1:35:02] because that's who god uses that's what
[1:35:04] he did in in the alpha
[1:35:06] he used paul and he used elijah in this
[1:35:08] last day to do what
[1:35:10] bring us the mighty god unveiled amen
[1:35:14] i get that i should obey it i get why i
[1:35:17] should obey it i get what he done and i
[1:35:19] get why he done it
[1:35:23] so we're able to grasp his divine
[1:35:25] purpose
[1:35:27] where we're given to see its relevance
[1:35:30] in real time here at the end time what a
[1:35:32] privilege friend
[1:35:33] this is accomplished because god
[1:35:37] because god here's why it's accomplished
[1:35:40] because because you smelled good
[1:35:45] you were a nice person you were smarter
[1:35:48] than the average bear
[1:35:52] no it's accomplished because god
[1:35:55] made known unto us the mystery of his
[1:35:57] will
[1:35:58] [Music]
[1:36:00] that he's bringing all things into an
[1:36:03] expression called
[1:36:04] christ this is why he deals with my life
[1:36:08] this is why he won't let
[1:36:10] me be like the world this is why he
[1:36:13] won't let you
[1:36:15] this is why he makes me preach these
[1:36:17] sermons this is why you hear the prophet
[1:36:19] screaming out on a tape
[1:36:20] this is why sometimes it seems like the
[1:36:22] preachers in your business
[1:36:24] this is why because he's made known to
[1:36:27] us the mystery of his will
[1:36:29] that he's determined to bring all of his
[1:36:32] family into one grand expression where
[1:36:34] we're all identical
[1:36:36] christ see
[1:36:39] now all right matt let's do it
[1:36:42] title screen
[1:36:47] praise the lord so i'm continuing from
[1:36:50] last week
[1:36:51] the final season okay you're dismissed
[1:36:53] i'm just kidding
[1:36:56] okay uh you're controlling it hey matt
[1:36:59] so next the harvest time all right now
[1:37:02] here we come to the statue of perfect
[1:37:03] man now
[1:37:05] don't read ahead of me all right if you
[1:37:06] do you're going to read what you've
[1:37:07] already read a million times anyway but
[1:37:09] just
[1:37:10] let me let me go along
[1:37:13] it's it's shocking to me it defies logic
[1:37:16] to me
[1:37:16] that people can't follow the simple way
[1:37:19] brother branham taught this pyramid
[1:37:22] that it has actually been taught to me
[1:37:24] by seasoned veterans
[1:37:26] that you see you first have to perfect
[1:37:29] your faith and virtue knowledge and
[1:37:30] temperance and patience and godliness
[1:37:32] and brotherly kindness then he'll give
[1:37:33] you the holy ghost and seal you in
[1:37:36] i'm like oh if i can do that why do i
[1:37:38] need him
[1:37:41] if i can already perfect myself what do
[1:37:43] i need how redundant would the holy
[1:37:45] ghost be
[1:37:46] because i can already do all that myself
[1:37:49] and see here's what brother branham
[1:37:50] taught you can't do that
[1:37:53] and if you and even if you would manage
[1:37:55] to do a version of it which wouldn't be
[1:37:57] perfect
[1:37:58] it'd still be filthiness to god it'd
[1:38:01] still
[1:38:02] be filthy rags to him
[1:38:05] even if you could manage a version of it
[1:38:07] so
[1:38:08] brother branham said all you'd do is
[1:38:10] you'd be a blackbird trying to put
[1:38:12] peacock feathers in your tail
[1:38:14] to make everybody think you're a peacock
[1:38:16] and he said you wouldn't be you'd still
[1:38:17] be a black bird you're still unconverted
[1:38:20] so so these things can't be human
[1:38:23] accomplishment
[1:38:24] and that's why the foundation is faith
[1:38:26] what is the new birth that's why when
[1:38:28] brother branham drew the original
[1:38:30] drawing and i have it
[1:38:31] he drew a space of line underneath faith
[1:38:34] because that's the door that's where you
[1:38:36] come in that's christ what is the new
[1:38:38] birth it's a revelation of jesus christ
[1:38:40] to you
[1:38:41] pers personally to you brother ram said
[1:38:43] that's what faith is
[1:38:45] a revelation you see
[1:38:49] friends first of all is this is this the
[1:38:53] an uh a reflection of the church yes is
[1:38:56] it a reflection of a man a christian
[1:38:57] yes well you don't have the church until
[1:39:00] you get the holy ghost
[1:39:02] so how do you already have a church if
[1:39:04] it's not even have the holy ghost yet
[1:39:06] you see you don't have the holy ghost on
[1:39:08] the day of pentecost you didn't have the
[1:39:10] church
[1:39:10] until the holy ghost came then you had
[1:39:12] the church neither do you have the man
[1:39:14] until the
[1:39:15] until the new birth you see so you come
[1:39:18] in at faith and then from there now
[1:39:20] i'm going to prove it to you in a minute
[1:39:22] then you say well why does brother
[1:39:23] branham have the holy ghost
[1:39:25] right here well there's a very simple
[1:39:27] explanation for that listen to what he
[1:39:29] says
[1:39:30] statue of a perfect man add to your
[1:39:32] faith virtue
[1:39:34] now see it's not going to do you any
[1:39:35] good if it's just all human
[1:39:37] add to your faith virtue and divert your
[1:39:39] knowledge to knowledge temperance to
[1:39:40] temperance patience to your patients
[1:39:42] godliness to your brotherly
[1:39:43] to your godliness brotherly love to your
[1:39:45] brotherly love the holy spirit
[1:39:48] and christ will come next
[1:39:51] because just beneath him
[1:39:54] the holy spirit of jesus christ
[1:39:58] into the church to manifest those
[1:40:01] virtues
[1:40:03] you understand he's he got him right
[1:40:05] here because
[1:40:06] he's got to be and brother branham i
[1:40:07] didn't put the quotes up and brother
[1:40:09] branham
[1:40:09] in his drawing he says you see he said
[1:40:12] look in that pillar of fire he said look
[1:40:14] in that amber light
[1:40:15] he said you'll see that burled wavy
[1:40:17] colors he said it's moving all through
[1:40:19] there why
[1:40:19] why does it look like that because it's
[1:40:22] a living being
[1:40:23] it's the glory of god you understand and
[1:40:26] he says in that
[1:40:27] that is shining down through the church
[1:40:30] or down through the man
[1:40:31] christ is the head the holy ghost is the
[1:40:34] head this is what when
[1:40:36] when this is in complete control of this
[1:40:38] around the world
[1:40:39] then the rapture takes place now the
[1:40:41] capstone comes in the form of the open
[1:40:43] word already
[1:40:45] christ among us now but i'm still
[1:40:46] looking for a corporal appearing you
[1:40:50] understand all right
[1:40:51] next brother branham says same message
[1:40:55] i pledge this morning to him with all my
[1:40:58] heart this after he taught what i just
[1:41:00] showed you
[1:41:01] i pledge to him with all my heart that
[1:41:03] by his help
[1:41:05] and by his grace i pray that i'll seek
[1:41:08] daily without ceasing until i feel
[1:41:11] every one of these requirements flowing
[1:41:13] in this little old stature of mine
[1:41:15] till i become a manifestation of the
[1:41:17] living christ
[1:41:19] it's no so let me ask you a question as
[1:41:22] brother branham preached a sermon and
[1:41:23] he's now admitting friends i'm sorry i'm
[1:41:25] not even born again i just realized
[1:41:28] i just realized that i haven't even got
[1:41:30] all of these living yet so i must not
[1:41:31] have the holy ghost sorry
[1:41:34] so are you going to make him unborn
[1:41:35] again of course he's born again
[1:41:38] and now he's saying now that i've
[1:41:40] realized how this works
[1:41:42] that it's christ over the church over
[1:41:44] the man the mind of christ
[1:41:47] moving down bringing bringing through me
[1:41:49] bringing all things together
[1:41:51] in the expression of christ he says that
[1:41:54] i pledge with all my heart
[1:41:57] here's what you should pledge today that
[1:41:59] by his help and
[1:42:00] by his grace remember it gives you
[1:42:03] wisdom and understanding
[1:42:05] remember you gotta apply it to your life
[1:42:07] you gotta gird up your mind you gotta be
[1:42:09] self-controlled
[1:42:11] why because that because if your
[1:42:13] self-controlled
[1:42:14] he has no obstructions
[1:42:18] he can flow through you now watch
[1:42:21] so i pray by his help by his grace i
[1:42:23] pray that i'll seek daily
[1:42:25] daily daily what if it read like this
[1:42:29] i'll i'll pray that i'll seek every time
[1:42:32] i come to church occasionally
[1:42:35] well i'm better than that brother jason
[1:42:36] i come on wednesdays and sundays okay
[1:42:38] so you'll you'll seek on wednesdays and
[1:42:40] sundays brother branham says i'll seek
[1:42:43] daily without ceasing well when i got
[1:42:46] time when i without
[1:42:47] ceasing until i feel every one of these
[1:42:51] requirements flowing
[1:42:52] in this little stature of mine till i
[1:42:55] can be a manifestation
[1:42:57] of the living christ
[1:43:01] yes lord yes now
[1:43:04] watch this next
[1:43:10] and the church
[1:43:14] all right won't finish it
[1:43:17] israel and the church part four
[1:43:20] i believe we're on the borderline
[1:43:22] tonight i was wondering about all my
[1:43:23] meetings and things how i had to cancel
[1:43:25] them out
[1:43:26] i truly believe before the church can
[1:43:28] have the rapture
[1:43:29] it's going to have rapturing faith we
[1:43:32] can't even have faith for divine healing
[1:43:34] let alone rapturing faith got to have
[1:43:35] faith
[1:43:36] that'll change now watch because faith
[1:43:39] comes by
[1:43:40] hearing the word so i've just said to
[1:43:42] people many times how you expect to have
[1:43:44] a rapturing
[1:43:45] faith without a rapturing word if all
[1:43:48] you've got is the word of the ages how
[1:43:49] are you going to go in a rapture
[1:43:52] see and so so he says we can't even have
[1:43:56] faith for divine healing let alone
[1:43:57] rapturing faith
[1:43:58] gotta have a faith that will change and
[1:44:00] quicken this body and be taken away
[1:44:02] i believe there's a church on its road
[1:44:05] tonight
[1:44:06] thank god a power of the living god
[1:44:09] that men will speak the word here and
[1:44:11] there and it'll flash like lightning
[1:44:14] and a church is coming out not
[1:44:16] psychologists
[1:44:18] not some of this put on make-believe
[1:44:21] but a real true genuine
[1:44:25] anointed holy ghost called
[1:44:28] out church now
[1:44:31] watch what brother branham says next
[1:44:35] now the voice now watch brother branham
[1:44:37] comes into
[1:44:38] revelation chapter 4 part 3.
[1:44:41] all right he's teaching on revelation 4.
[1:44:45] the voice of the throne you'll notice in
[1:44:48] in
[1:44:49] several places in revelation if i'd i
[1:44:51] could i don't want to show them all
[1:44:53] because i don't want to get sidetracked
[1:44:54] on it
[1:44:54] but there's numbers of places in the
[1:44:56] book of revelation where you hear about
[1:44:58] thunders and lightnings thunders and
[1:44:59] lightnings
[1:45:00] chapter 4 talks about there was voices
[1:45:03] and thunders and lightnings and there's
[1:45:05] another place where
[1:45:07] said i the the heaven was open i saw the
[1:45:09] the the ark and he said and there were
[1:45:10] lightnings and thunderings and voices
[1:45:13] and then it happens again a third time
[1:45:14] later on now watch
[1:45:16] now the voice of the throne notice in
[1:45:19] this throne before the throne
[1:45:22] was the seven stars all right read along
[1:45:24] with me
[1:45:25] the voice of the stars voices
[1:45:28] you see there was more in the revelation
[1:45:31] four here five we find out
[1:45:34] and out of the throne preceded lightning
[1:45:37] thunders and voices not one voice
[1:45:40] voices plural what was it
[1:45:44] simple explanation god speaking to the
[1:45:47] church
[1:45:48] reflecting himself through the seven
[1:45:51] spirits
[1:45:52] all right now just hold right there man
[1:45:54] so god is reflecting himself
[1:45:57] through the seven spirits so it's not
[1:45:59] one voice
[1:46:00] it's plural voices what is lightnings
[1:46:03] and thunders
[1:46:05] voices all right it's god speaking to
[1:46:08] the church
[1:46:09] reflecting himself through seven spirits
[1:46:12] he say okay i got it
[1:46:13] it's god speaking right right but now
[1:46:17] let's watch how god does it
[1:46:19] watch how god speaks next slide
[1:46:23] when the true anointed of
[1:46:26] god speaks it's the voice of god
[1:46:29] amen to reject it is to remove the
[1:46:33] candlestick see voices
[1:46:34] the voice of the seven church ages over
[1:46:37] here in the corner the voice is
[1:46:38] speaking with thunder and lightning next
[1:46:41] slide
[1:46:42] where's the holy spirit here at the
[1:46:44] throne
[1:46:45] shining out in in each church age
[1:46:48] the church ages now look the church age
[1:46:51] is reflecting back this way the voices
[1:46:54] of god now remember our pyramid
[1:46:56] he's reflecting above you down into the
[1:46:58] church
[1:46:59] and your life is turned around
[1:47:01] reflecting back to him
[1:47:03] so that he's he sees his own reflection
[1:47:06] in the church
[1:47:08] and that's the voice of god because his
[1:47:10] family
[1:47:11] is a living voice of god in the earth
[1:47:15] watch the church age is reflecting back
[1:47:19] this way the voices of god
[1:47:20] jesus christ the same yesterday and
[1:47:22] forever how does god prove he's the same
[1:47:25] yesterday and forever by
[1:47:26] operating through his family that's what
[1:47:28] that's how he proves it that the same
[1:47:30] signs and wonders they had in the early
[1:47:32] church
[1:47:33] we have the same signs and wonders here
[1:47:34] the same power the same doctrine
[1:47:36] the same spirit the same lives the same
[1:47:38] results you understand
[1:47:40] it proves you're he's remember he's
[1:47:43] reconciling
[1:47:44] all things in the expression of christ
[1:47:47] you are that's why brother branham would
[1:47:50] make tremendous statements like
[1:47:52] you are the blood of god by the spirit
[1:47:56] that he would say she is him she has
[1:47:59] thus
[1:47:59] saith the lord she knows what he wants
[1:48:02] done with his word
[1:48:03] she he would call her mrs jesus christ
[1:48:08] so now you're understanding a broader a
[1:48:10] broader thinking of
[1:48:11] all of these voices these thunders and
[1:48:13] these lightnings and these voices watch
[1:48:17] so he says the voice of god jesus christ
[1:48:20] same yesterday and forever
[1:48:21] see seven there was voices and seven
[1:48:24] lamps of fire seven spirits which are
[1:48:26] the seven spirits of god next
[1:48:28] now he's going to go to ezekiel i'm
[1:48:29] going to try to wrap it up in about 15
[1:48:31] minutes
[1:48:32] so he's going to go to ezekiel he says
[1:48:34] now when ezekiel saw the glory of god
[1:48:37] he saw the same thing that john saw you
[1:48:39] remember last sunday we got how the
[1:48:41] glory of god
[1:48:42] and got the picture here he had taken
[1:48:44] with us you remember that the glory of
[1:48:46] god
[1:48:46] same thing ezekiel saw same thing john
[1:48:49] saw it here today
[1:48:51] makes jesus christ the same in ezekiel's
[1:48:53] time does that make sense to you
[1:48:55] so john knows it's the same one because
[1:48:57] he knows that's what ezekiel saw
[1:48:58] all right these four living creatures
[1:49:02] all right i'm sorry that print is so
[1:49:04] small but just stay
[1:49:05] stay right there all right
[1:49:08] so he says um go back to the previous
[1:49:12] slide matt
[1:49:15] okay i apologize okay now uh just stay
[1:49:18] stay right there for a minute i must not
[1:49:20] have put these two frames in
[1:49:22] john saw it here today jesus makes jesus
[1:49:26] christ the same in ezekiel's time same
[1:49:28] thing was here on earth
[1:49:29] same god that's here with us today same
[1:49:31] yesterday and forever
[1:49:32] that which was which is shall come thee
[1:49:35] the entrance to the soul body and spirit
[1:49:37] the brazen sea the world the sanctifier
[1:49:39] of our soul
[1:49:40] the filler with the holy spirit the same
[1:49:43] thing see
[1:49:43] just the same now all right next frame
[1:49:47] now we go to ezekiel's vision uh how did
[1:49:50] you
[1:49:50] did you just there you go all right so
[1:49:52] we come here to ezekiel
[1:49:54] um one i don't know why that's out of
[1:49:56] sync but it's okay i'm gonna forge ahead
[1:49:59] now watch here's ezekiel 1 12.
[1:50:02] and they went everyone straight forward
[1:50:04] whether the spirit was to go they went
[1:50:06] and they turned not when they went
[1:50:09] now let me let me give you a little
[1:50:11] insight here so you don't just go into a
[1:50:13] fog
[1:50:15] john sees a wheel in the middle of the
[1:50:16] wheel all right
[1:50:18] and it's what he's seeing is a bunch of
[1:50:22] different creatures living creatures and
[1:50:24] he's seeing all kinds of things
[1:50:25] and he's noticing that when the leader
[1:50:29] moves they all move and when the leader
[1:50:33] moves they all move
[1:50:34] and and they never go backwards because
[1:50:36] the word doesn't go backwards
[1:50:38] what they will do is they'll go this way
[1:50:40] or they might turn
[1:50:41] and go this way but if even if they turn
[1:50:44] and go this way they're still going
[1:50:46] forward
[1:50:47] and they turn they're always going
[1:50:48] forward and
[1:50:50] when the christ moved the creatures
[1:50:53] moved you understand the wheel move what
[1:50:56] is it
[1:50:56] showing it's showing god in control
[1:51:00] through his anointing on his family in
[1:51:03] the earth
[1:51:04] because these living creatures are
[1:51:06] anointings
[1:51:07] on the people you're today under an
[1:51:10] eagle anointing
[1:51:12] that's why it makes you act like you act
[1:51:14] you say
[1:51:15] why why am i living such a life
[1:51:18] of a believer because the anointing
[1:51:20] that's on you is living that kind of a
[1:51:22] life
[1:51:23] and when the holy spirit moves forward
[1:51:25] you just move forward
[1:51:27] and sometimes that forward movement
[1:51:29] friends leave you
[1:51:30] family leave you churches might boot you
[1:51:33] out but you
[1:51:34] have to go because the spirit is moving
[1:51:37] and however it moves i'm moving with it
[1:51:39] i i'm never going backwards i'm not
[1:51:41] standing still i'm not
[1:51:43] sitting on my luggage waiting on the old
[1:51:45] ship of zion i'm on the move
[1:51:49] see and so next next slide
[1:51:54] all right um close enough yeah
[1:51:57] there's there's what i there's what i
[1:51:59] read okay next slide
[1:52:00] all right um next one all right now
[1:52:04] we're caught up
[1:52:05] so they couldn't turn if they was going
[1:52:08] this way it was go like
[1:52:09] like a man going this way or going like
[1:52:11] an eagle going this way like an ox going
[1:52:13] this way
[1:52:13] they was going like a lion they couldn't
[1:52:15] go backward they had to go forward
[1:52:17] everywhere they went
[1:52:17] one each one of the beasts now what does
[1:52:20] a beast mean in the bible power all
[1:52:22] right a pat a means a power
[1:52:24] ver next slide as for the likeness of
[1:52:27] the living creatures
[1:52:29] and their appearance was like burning
[1:52:31] coals of fire
[1:52:33] like the appearance of lamps it went up
[1:52:35] and down among the living creatures and
[1:52:36] the fire was bright
[1:52:38] and out of the fire now jd watch this
[1:52:41] and out of the fire went forth light
[1:52:43] that's god
[1:52:45] from the fire went light not cosmic
[1:52:47] light
[1:52:48] now the eternal light brother jason i
[1:52:50] were talking about the eternal fire
[1:52:52] that fell on sodom say well if it's
[1:52:55] eternal it'd still be burning today
[1:52:57] it's not campfire fire it's not campfire
[1:53:01] this isn't cosmic light it's not
[1:53:02] campfire fire
[1:53:04] it's not what you got with a log it's
[1:53:07] it's eternal fire
[1:53:08] it's eternal light it's god's fire it's
[1:53:11] god's light
[1:53:13] see and so so watch now
[1:53:16] so he says and the living creatures ran
[1:53:20] and turned let's see the living
[1:53:23] creatures ran
[1:53:23] and returned and as the appearance of a
[1:53:26] look at this there it is again a flash
[1:53:27] of lightning
[1:53:28] now as i beheld the living creature
[1:53:30] behold one wheel upon the earth by the
[1:53:31] living creatures
[1:53:32] which is his four faces brother brown
[1:53:35] says the appearance of wheels
[1:53:37] see here's ezekiel 1 as for the likeness
[1:53:41] of the living creatures their appearance
[1:53:42] was like burning coals of fire and their
[1:53:44] appearance of land and like the
[1:53:45] appearance of lamps
[1:53:46] it went up and down among the living
[1:53:47] creatures and fire was bright out of the
[1:53:49] fire
[1:53:50] went forth lightning it a it was a wheel
[1:53:54] in the middle of a wheel what's the
[1:53:56] symbol here brother branham
[1:53:58] what is it it means that these guards
[1:54:00] these guards was god's ark next
[1:54:03] they were in journey rolling on wheels
[1:54:06] when ezekiel saw them
[1:54:08] but when john saw them they had already
[1:54:10] come to the right position in heaven
[1:54:12] remember john was caught up to the end
[1:54:14] to the lord's day amen
[1:54:18] and he saw the elders and he saw the
[1:54:20] living creatures around the throne and
[1:54:21] they weren't
[1:54:22] roaming the earth anymore and and john
[1:54:24] is weeping and crying and yet one of the
[1:54:26] elders is able to say to him
[1:54:28] john stop crying why should i stop
[1:54:31] crying because i'm already at the end
[1:54:33] and i already know we win and i already
[1:54:35] know we get here
[1:54:36] and you don't have to worry you're
[1:54:37] you've been caught forward
[1:54:39] you're you're still you're still
[1:54:41] thousands of years ago but you've been
[1:54:42] caught forward to the end day
[1:54:44] i'm just want to tell you go back and
[1:54:45] tell the church no matter what you see
[1:54:47] through 2000 years it's okay we make
[1:54:50] it we make it
[1:54:54] john saw those anointings and they were
[1:54:56] before the throne they weren't rolling
[1:54:58] on the earth anymore
[1:54:59] i'm here to tell you something friends
[1:55:00] we're getting home this message is
[1:55:03] getting you home
[1:55:04] hallelujah he is bringing all things
[1:55:07] together
[1:55:08] in the expression of christ
[1:55:11] they were rolling wheels as they took it
[1:55:13] from place to place minute was in travel
[1:55:16] they took it all the way up through the
[1:55:17] wilderness and all the way to the temple
[1:55:18] and so forth but now it's received up
[1:55:20] because the church age is over it's
[1:55:22] received into glory you don't see
[1:55:23] see so so that that's why
[1:55:27] you don't see these living creatures
[1:55:30] again these four beasts
[1:55:32] you don't see them again after
[1:55:34] revelation 19 4.
[1:55:35] amen you don't see them again you know
[1:55:38] you know you know what you know what the
[1:55:39] next event is
[1:55:41] once they bow out and their their job is
[1:55:44] done
[1:55:44] then you see christ and his armies which
[1:55:47] is his bride
[1:55:48] riding out and then from there the river
[1:55:51] of life and from there the holy city and
[1:55:53] from there
[1:55:53] the spirit and the bride say come i'm
[1:55:55] here to tell you something friends you
[1:55:57] have
[1:55:57] you have arrived by every sign of the
[1:56:00] bible that we are in the last
[1:56:02] moments of history and we're already in
[1:56:04] the cycle of a rapture
[1:56:06] and we're getting ready to to sit at a
[1:56:08] table thousands of miles long
[1:56:12] hallelujah see
[1:56:15] so so so brother branham
[1:56:18] brother branham will go on and on and on
[1:56:21] to talk about
[1:56:23] the the spirit
[1:56:26] the lightning the thunder and we
[1:56:29] find that he'll go into the first seal
[1:56:32] he'll go into the fourth seal
[1:56:33] even he'll even pick up moses and elijah
[1:56:36] and the tribulation
[1:56:37] says they can call for flies and they
[1:56:39] can call for anything
[1:56:40] see because it's the word of god
[1:56:42] remember he says satan
[1:56:44] gets slain by a sword that comes out of
[1:56:46] the mouth of god
[1:56:47] remember that in book of revelation but
[1:56:50] then brother branham says
[1:56:51] but it's actually he said moses is the
[1:56:54] one speaking god came to moses and said
[1:56:57] now i've come down i've heard the cries
[1:56:58] of my people but i'm sending you i
[1:57:00] promised him i'd deliver them but i'm
[1:57:01] going to do it through you
[1:57:03] and and and brother branham said he gets
[1:57:06] slain by the word
[1:57:07] that proceeds out of their mouth when
[1:57:09] they come against the anointed
[1:57:11] that's when moses and elijah have that
[1:57:13] power brother branham talks about them
[1:57:15] operating that's those seven thunders
[1:57:17] see the seven thunders aren't just
[1:57:19] aren't just for us they they actually
[1:57:22] are the the the
[1:57:24] mystery truths that bring us to
[1:57:25] rapturing faith and take us off the
[1:57:27] earth
[1:57:27] but that keeps right on rolling moses
[1:57:29] and elijah pick up the same message
[1:57:31] and carry it back to israel while we're
[1:57:33] sitting at a table thousands of miles
[1:57:35] long
[1:57:36] oh my friends you realize this is god
[1:57:40] god is suppressing himself this
[1:57:43] is what the message is all about sit up
[1:57:46] young men sit up please
[1:57:48] if you didn't go to bed last night don't
[1:57:50] come in here if you're sleepy just stay
[1:57:52] home
[1:57:53] sit up pay attention amen
[1:57:57] so i've studied too hard i've worked too
[1:57:59] hard it's too important times too late
[1:58:01] stakes are too high your lives are at
[1:58:02] stake
[1:58:04] so i'm sorry if that sounds rude of me
[1:58:06] but this is important
[1:58:08] important it's important and and so
[1:58:11] so we find that that god
[1:58:14] is expressing himself in this last day
[1:58:18] to become christ in a living church
[1:58:22] you know something friends i'm gonna i'm
[1:58:23] gonna wrap up in close because i i've
[1:58:25] i know i've sponged your minds already i
[1:58:27] got a ton more to say we'll pick it up
[1:58:28] next time
[1:58:30] let me say this
[1:58:36] sometimes i don't think we realize
[1:58:40] just how vulnerable life is i got a hard
[1:58:43] lesson
[1:58:44] of that recently when i came close to
[1:58:47] checking out unexpectedly
[1:58:51] and it's changed my whole heart and my
[1:58:52] whole mind it's done something to me
[1:58:54] and i realize that every day i'm alive
[1:58:56] i'm here by his grace
[1:58:59] and i don't think you realize how
[1:59:01] vulnerable let's just talk about human
[1:59:02] biology for a minute
[1:59:04] i mean put yourself on a jet
[1:59:07] you're in a metal tube at an atmosphere
[1:59:11] you can't breathe in
[1:59:12] going nearly the speed of sound and if
[1:59:15] even a window would crack
[1:59:17] everybody in the aircraft would die in
[1:59:18] seconds
[1:59:21] you said well it dropped down your lungs
[1:59:22] would implode you'd be at 35 000 feet
[1:59:26] you understand i don't think you realize
[1:59:28] just how vulnerable you go down the road
[1:59:30] you're driving 70-80 miles an hour and a
[1:59:33] tire blows or somebody does something
[1:59:35] stupid in front of you
[1:59:36] and statistically if if you have an
[1:59:38] accident
[1:59:39] at 80 miles an hour this is
[1:59:40] statistically and leave the road
[1:59:43] your chances of surviving statistically
[1:59:46] are zero
[1:59:48] statistically there's not even enough
[1:59:51] survivors to make it
[1:59:52] 0.1 percent if you leave the road at 80
[1:59:55] miles an hour your chances are it's just
[1:59:57] the mercy of god
[1:59:58] do you realize you can go out you could
[2:00:00] walk outside
[2:00:02] and a mosquito bite you and you catch a
[2:00:03] zika virus that could
[2:00:05] you i mean do you realize how vulnerable
[2:00:07] do you realize how fleeting life is do
[2:00:08] you realize you could be in mcdonald's
[2:00:10] tomorrow and a shooter walk in
[2:00:11] do you realize what things could happen
[2:00:14] do you realize that that that the
[2:00:16] plagues and judgments have started
[2:00:18] listen to me young people
[2:00:19] the plagues and judgments have started
[2:00:21] in 1964 with the anchorage alaska that's
[2:00:24] thus saith the lord by a prophet
[2:00:26] the judgments began in anchorage alaska
[2:00:28] in 1964
[2:00:29] and they're going to keep unrolling and
[2:00:30] keep on rolling and that's what's
[2:00:31] happening now
[2:00:32] the world's gone the earth is it's
[2:00:34] burning down
[2:00:36] and i don't think you realize that your
[2:00:38] life is so vulnerable
[2:00:39] you live by the mercies of jesus christ
[2:00:42] and god's got you here for a purpose and
[2:00:45] i just say if that's the case
[2:00:47] then why would i be so dumb
[2:00:50] as to not just go ahead and surrender my
[2:00:53] whole
[2:00:54] life to him now i just want to say today
[2:00:57] lord i want to be that thunder and
[2:00:59] lightning i want to be

[2:01:55] an amen the bible
[2:01:59] says that we are to cast down
[2:02:02] any thought or imagination that exalts

[2:02:10] that to just be in my mind i don't just

[2:03:39] the devil wants to rock all of us to
[2:03:41] sleep

[2:03:45] prioritize
[2:03:47] everything and and
[2:03:52] and he's so crafty now just keep your
[2:03:54] heads about and listen to me for a
[2:03:55] minute i just want to tell you how the
[2:03:56] lord spoke to me this morning
[2:04:00] we're living in a day where there's such
[2:04:03] a blending
[2:04:05] of light and darkness i've said this to
[2:04:07] you before but i really want you to pay
[2:04:08] attention
[2:04:10] it's not like before remember it's not
[2:04:12] like back in the age
[2:04:13] of the church we're now been called out
[2:04:16] separated
[2:04:18] now simultaneously as brother diggs
[2:04:20] preached for us
[2:04:22] simultaneously while god is calling a
[2:04:24] church up into the revealed light of the
[2:04:26] hour
[2:04:28] satan is taking his throne over his
[2:04:30] satan's eden
[2:04:32] and so you have this supreme light in
[2:04:34] supreme darkness
[2:04:36] mingling together and there's such a
[2:04:38] blending
[2:04:40] there's such a blending and i want you
[2:04:41] to think up think about what i'm going
[2:04:43] to describe it to you
[2:04:46] back in the day way back in yesteryear
[2:04:52] it was pretty clear what was right and
[2:04:53] wrong
[2:04:55] i mean you didn't go to the bar rooms
[2:04:57] because you knew that was wrong
[2:04:58] you didn't go to the red light district
[2:05:00] in town because you knew that was wrong
[2:05:03] you knew what a brothel was you knew not
[2:05:04] to be in there
[2:05:06] you knew not to smoke and drink and
[2:05:08] curse and those things were just black
[2:05:09] and white and plain sassafras and
[2:05:11] everybody knew
[2:05:15] but we've hit a time now where there is
[2:05:18] such a blending of light and darkness
[2:05:20] and the tree of knowledge of good and
[2:05:22] evil
[2:05:22] right beside the tree of life to where
[2:05:25] satan has now taken things that it's
[2:05:28] unclear
[2:05:29] how harmful this might be here's
[2:05:31] something over here well what about it
[2:05:33] it seems fine
[2:05:34] it's just a technology it's just a this
[2:05:36] or it's just a that
[2:05:38] but wait a minute wait a minute did you
[2:05:40] know
[2:05:41] do you know friends that you have to
[2:05:44] have a mind prepared for prayer
[2:05:47] did you know that you have to exercise
[2:05:49] it you know it's like a muscle that you
[2:05:50] have to exercise
[2:05:51] do you do you realize that if your mind
[2:05:53] is all filled with just social media
[2:05:56] you're never gonna you can't you don't
[2:05:58] have the patience to pray
[2:06:00] because you gotta see what the next post
[2:06:01] is or the next tick tock or the next
[2:06:03] twitter or the next facebook or the next
[2:06:04] instagram
[2:06:05] and you it's it's like a craving you're
[2:06:07] almost like an addict
[2:06:08] you can't say oh i can i don't have to
[2:06:10] look at that well then let's see you
[2:06:11] pray for an hour
[2:06:13] well i don't think i can why why not
[2:06:15] because your mind isn't exercised for it
[2:06:19] your mind is so filled with
[2:06:20] entertainment that you don't have an
[2:06:23] exercised spirit you don't have any
[2:06:25] self-control
[2:06:26] to spend some quiet time with the lord
[2:06:29] to sit in a quiet place and
[2:06:31] block out the world and open your bible
[2:06:33] and read page after page after page
[2:06:36] chapter after chapter and just quietly
[2:06:39] talk and meditate on the things of god
[2:06:42] i'm not saying you're a bad person i'm
[2:06:45] sure you love god but you don't have a
[2:06:46] mind exercised
[2:06:48] to even be able to do that
[2:06:51] the blending of light and darkness has
[2:06:53] so clouded you
[2:06:55] that you've got things in your life and
[2:06:57] in your home
[2:06:58] and their activities and their games and
[2:07:00] their recreations
[2:07:01] and their entertainments and their
[2:07:03] business and their contacts
[2:07:04] and their social media and it's all
[2:07:06] integrated now to be a businessman you
[2:07:08] better be on social media
[2:07:10] if you want to have a successful
[2:07:11] business you better have your name out
[2:07:13] there
[2:07:14] there's nothing wrong we're not saying
[2:07:16] these things are wrong in and of
[2:07:17] themselves but how has the devil
[2:07:20] you got to have a career you got to work
[2:07:22] you got to pay bills you got to
[2:07:24] feed kids but how has the devil
[2:07:27] so prioritized those things in your mind
[2:07:29] that you don't even have a mind
[2:07:31] exercised for prayer
[2:07:33] you don't have a mind that can that's
[2:07:35] exercise to just sit quietly and read
[2:07:37] your bible
[2:07:38] or to put put put those headphones on
[2:07:41] and how about you turn on a voice of
[2:07:43] elijah the prophet
[2:07:46] when do we do that but yet we have no
[2:07:49] problem
[2:07:50] spending an hour in front of a screen
[2:07:52] two hours five hours
[2:07:53] nine hours adults
[2:07:56] kids and adults that let their kids
[2:08:01] preachers pastors we've all been guilty
[2:08:04] of it
[2:08:06] i want to tell you something friends
[2:08:07] it's not like it used to be
[2:08:09] god has called us out separate this is
[2:08:12] such a blending i'm here to tell you
[2:08:14] let me tell you something let me tell
[2:08:16] you something mom dad teenagers listen
[2:08:18] to me listen to your pastor
[2:08:21] if you don't have a sharp precision
[2:08:24] calibrated spiritual compass you're
[2:08:26] finished you're finished the blending is
[2:08:30] too blended
[2:08:31] it's too obscure it's the the bad is so
[2:08:35] intermingled with the good you'd have to
[2:08:37] go live in a commune to escape it
[2:08:39] you can't escape it i'm here to tell you
[2:08:41] you can't
[2:08:43] so the only way you're going to combat
[2:08:45] it is to turn your eyes away from
[2:08:48] a lot of it and turn your eyes upon
[2:08:50] jesus
[2:08:52] spend some time looking full into his
[2:08:54] wonderful face you know what will happen
[2:08:56] almost like magic the things of this
[2:08:59] world
[2:09:00] will grow strangely dim
[2:09:04] and you'll realize you enjoy the
[2:09:06] presence of god
[2:09:08] what was i missing all my life this is
[2:09:10] wonderful
[2:09:12] you can sit and have that feeling come
[2:09:14] down over you
[2:09:15] and just such peace and harmony it
[2:09:17] doesn't make all your troubles go away
[2:09:19] but you're not afraid of them anymore
[2:09:22] you have a purpose in life you're not
[2:09:24] aimless you don't feel bored

[2:09:28] to pray anymore they don't want to read
[2:09:30] their bible
[2:09:31] it's it's boring to them it's because
[2:09:34] they don't have a mind exercise
[2:09:35] to it they've let the they've let the
[2:09:38] blending of light
[2:09:39] oh they're believers oh sure it's a
[2:09:42] blending remember what i'm saying

[2:09:53] denying that
[2:09:55] but are you is god able
[2:09:59] to bring all things together in you
[2:10:02] in the expression of christ
[2:10:06] those living creatures were guardians
[2:10:10] that's what they're doing in you now
[2:10:12] they're guarding the way of life in
[2:10:14] you your life is now an expression
[2:10:17] of that living creature that anointing
