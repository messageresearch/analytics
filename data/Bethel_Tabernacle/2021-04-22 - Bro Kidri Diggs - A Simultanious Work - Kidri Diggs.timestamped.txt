[41:21] pray the church say amen
[41:23] amen praise the lord if you have your
[41:25] bible let's go to um
[41:27] revelations the fourth chapter
[41:30] amen and i i covered your prayers
[41:39] familiar uh verse of scriptures
[41:43] you know revelation
[41:47] shouldn't be something that we are
[41:49] afraid to touch
[41:51] but revelation even the book of
[41:54] revelation
[41:55] you know it identifies who this bride is
[41:58] you know and satan the prophet of god
[42:00] said there's two books that the devil
[42:02] hates it's genesis
[42:03] and it's revelation one tells it's
[42:05] beginning one tells it's end
[42:07] so we um just want to dive into this
[42:11] let's just start reading that verse one
[42:13] revelation five verse 1 the bible says
[42:15] and i saw
[42:16] in the right hand of him that set on the
[42:19] throne
[42:20] a book written within on the backside
[42:23] sealed with seven seals and i saw a
[42:26] strong angel proclaiming
[42:28] with a loud voice who is worthy to open
[42:30] the book
[42:31] and to loose the seals thereof and no
[42:35] man
[42:35] in heaven nor in earth neither under the
[42:38] earth
[42:39] was able to open the book neither to
[42:41] look there on
[42:43] and i wept much because no man was found
[42:46] worthy to open the
[42:48] to open and to read the book neither to
[42:51] look there on
[42:52] and one of the elders saith unto me weep
[42:55] not
[42:56] behold the lion of the tribe of judah
[42:59] the root of david
[43:00] have prevailed to open the book and to
[43:03] loose the
[43:04] seven seals thereof now you notice
[43:07] this work it was a complete work
[43:10] it wasn't just six seals it was seven
[43:14] and and the scripture says that this
[43:16] lamb he loosed
[43:18] all seven seals amen verse
[43:21] uh eight six and be hell
[43:24] and i beheld and low in the midst of the
[43:26] throne of the four
[43:28] beasts and in the midst of the eldest
[43:30] stood a lamb as
[43:31] it had been slain having seven horns and
[43:34] seven eyes which
[43:35] are the seven spirits of god sent forth
[43:38] into all the earth
[43:40] and he came and took the book out of the
[43:41] right hand of him that set upon the
[43:44] throne
[43:45] and when he had taken the book the four
[43:48] beasts and four and twenty elders fell
[43:50] down before
[43:52] the lamb having every one of them harps
[43:55] and golden
[43:56] vows full of odors which are the prayers
[43:59] of the saints
[44:00] and they sung a new song saying thou art
[44:04] worthy
[44:05] to take the book and to open the seals
[44:08] thereof
[44:09] for thou art slain and has
[44:12] redeemed us to god by the by thy blood
[44:16] out of every kindred and tongue
[44:20] and people and nation real quick let's
[44:23] go to ephesians chapter 4
[44:34] ephesians
[44:39] ephesians chapter 4 um
[44:43] let's read verse verse 30.
[44:46] the bible says and grieve not the holy
[44:49] spirit
[44:50] of god whereby ye are sealed unto the
[44:53] day of
[44:54] redemption amen may the lord bless
[44:56] reading of his word
[44:58] you can have your seats
[45:03] can you give me a bottle of water thank
[45:04] you amen praise the lord you know um
[45:09] uh by the grace of god i i i don't kind
[45:12] of i don't kind of want this to be a
[45:15] uh a service of doctrine or
[45:19] service of of of of
[45:22] i know this and you know that but what
[45:25] we want to deal with
[45:26] my my title tonight is a simultaneous
[45:29] work
[45:31] now when we when we look in the bible
[45:33] you know especially the book of
[45:34] revelations
[45:35] it clearly says that no one was worthy
[45:38] you know and john he wept and
[45:40] he wept over the condition of what what
[45:44] what the state of mind and everything
[45:46] was at this time
[45:48] that there was a book and the book was
[45:49] closed and it was sealed
[45:51] and there was no one to open the seals
[45:54] but then if we think about the seal and
[45:57] and and sometimes i think we make these
[46:00] things
[46:00] so complicated but when we look at a
[46:03] seal a seal
[46:05] it's something that's closed up so god
[46:07] when he came
[46:09] to loose the seals he was revealing
[46:11] something amen
[46:12] he was loosening something that had been
[46:15] closed for
[46:16] generations unto generation but what i
[46:18] want to say church
[46:20] in this in this revealing that god was
[46:23] doing
[46:24] there was two things that was happening
[46:26] hallelujah
[46:28] it was a simultaneous work hallelujah
[46:31] simultaneous that means it it's
[46:34] existing occurring or operating
[46:37] at the same time amen think about that
[46:40] word simultaneous
[46:42] so what i want you to catch tonight as
[46:44] we're talking about the seals
[46:46] uh let's look at what god did now the
[46:49] bible says
[46:50] he loosed the seal but you know one
[46:53] thing i want you to understand
[46:54] when he loosed the seal he was sealing a
[46:57] seal
[46:57] at the same time hallelujah and you know
[47:00] when he
[47:01] loosed us and he set us free he also
[47:04] sealed us in him hallelujah so it was a
[47:07] simultaneous
[47:09] work being taken place in that very
[47:11] moment
[47:12] when we recognize what christ has done
[47:14] for us but let's look at it church
[47:16] listen what the bible what the prophet
[47:18] god says he says he says now
[47:20] this messenger of malachi 4 in
[47:22] revelations chapter 7
[47:24] is going to do two things one according
[47:27] to malachi 4
[47:28] he will turn the hearts of the children
[47:31] to the fathers
[47:32] two he will reveal the mysteries of the
[47:35] seven thunders
[47:36] in revelation chapter 10 which are the
[47:39] revelations containing
[47:41] in the seven seals it will be these
[47:44] divinely revealed mysteries
[47:47] truths that literally turn the hearts of
[47:50] the children
[47:51] to the pentecostal fathers so the
[47:54] ministry of malachi
[47:55] 4 is doing two things simultaneously
[47:59] it's turning our hearts back hallelujah
[48:01] turning our hearts back
[48:03] to the apostolic fathers hallelujah and
[48:05] it's revealing the mystery
[48:07] mystery truth that this message has
[48:10] brought forth to us
[48:11] amen so church when we look at the seal
[48:14] of jesus christ
[48:15] the seal of his life the seal over us
[48:19] what did god do for us amen let's look
[48:21] at it
[48:22] he says now after we get through the
[48:25] seventh seal
[48:26] then at the time of the sounding of the
[48:29] seven seal
[48:30] or the loosening see there was a
[48:33] loosening now when we say that god came
[48:36] and he loosed the seal what did he lose
[48:39] hallelujah
[48:40] what did he lose church he lose the work
[48:43] of redemption
[48:44] for us to be free to serve him
[48:47] hallelujah
[48:48] so we are loose to serve him but still
[48:51] that we could never be lost hallelujah
[48:54] so simultaneously we're loosed but we're
[48:57] sealed amen
[48:59] if you're catching what i'm saying i
[49:00] hope you catch it you know he said
[49:03] he said we're losing costs we know
[49:07] what a seal is is to lose the ministry
[49:11] to lose the seventh seal so as we're
[49:13] listening to
[49:15] the message of malachi 4 what is it
[49:17] doing it's loosening
[49:19] us from all of our bondage
[49:22] it's loosening us from every sickness
[49:25] it's loosening
[49:26] us from every depression everything
[49:29] that this world had us bonded up to
[49:32] this word came and it loosed us it broke
[49:35] the seal
[49:36] hallelujah that had us in bondage and at
[49:39] the same time
[49:40] while the seal was broke we were
[49:42] refilled
[49:43] in jesus christ hallelujah
[49:46] come on somebody he says then we'll see
[49:50] the right on the child he say is
[49:53] loosening a message
[49:55] something that sealed up hallelujah
[49:58] so when the message of the hour came it
[50:01] was a loosening
[50:02] of revelation but a ceiling of a bride
[50:07] glory oh my church we got something
[50:11] hallelujah that that that the world
[50:13] knows nothing about
[50:15] you know what the enemy does he tries to
[50:17] get us
[50:18] to major over minors and we argue about
[50:21] simple points
[50:22] but when god came he set us free from
[50:24] bondage
[50:25] hallelujah he loosed he lose you
[50:28] from your own self
[50:33] only to seal you again in him
[50:39] oh my it was a simultaneous work
[50:42] at the same time while you're receiving
[50:45] jesus christ through his blood in faith
[50:49] you're being sealed in jesus christ
[50:51] hallelujah
[50:52] through faith amen so you're being
[50:55] loosed hallelujah
[50:56] and you're being chilled at the same
[50:58] time glory to god
[51:00] you say brother jake you're being
[51:01] confusing hallelujah well let me say it
[51:03] like this church
[51:04] amen we all know what we were before
[51:08] we accepted jesus christ amen we were
[51:11] hallelujah
[51:12] bound to our own thoughts we were bound
[51:15] to the ways of the enemy
[51:16] so god had to come and take the book
[51:19] hallelujah
[51:20] no one was worthy to take the book if we
[51:23] go back
[51:24] hallelujah we go back in the old
[51:25] testament why do we have to be loosed
[51:28] amen because hallelujah under those old
[51:31] testaments amen
[51:32] our nature could never be loosed heard
[51:35] from sin they will offer sacrifice after
[51:39] sacrifice
[51:40] but we still go back to that same nature
[51:43] that same bondage hunger then jesus came
[51:47] gave his life what did he do he took the
[51:49] book and he loosed us
[51:52] the lamb giving his life when he gave
[51:54] his life
[51:55] he set us free hallelujah oh my
[51:59] and by setting us free he sealed us
[52:02] again
[52:04] hallelujah listen he said
[52:09] what was that separation to do what did
[52:12] the separation
[52:14] separate them from as soon as they
[52:16] received the separation
[52:19] they were free amen as soon as you
[52:21] receive
[52:22] jesus christ hallelujah in your life
[52:25] you're loosed
[52:28] holy and then you're sealed oh god
[52:32] i hope somebody catch it church
[52:34] hallelujah it's a simultaneous act
[52:37] holy at the same time you're denying
[52:40] satan
[52:41] you're receiving christ hallelujah all
[52:43] right think about it i heard they say
[52:45] one time
[52:46] in a picture or play the same person
[52:49] that that they drew to be jesus was the
[52:52] same person
[52:53] they drew to be jewless
[52:57] what a characteristic hallelujah so
[52:59] church
[53:01] it's amazing that people don't even
[53:03] realize that they've been
[53:04] loosed hallelujah and they're still
[53:07] living in bondage
[53:08] when god has sealed them to be free
[53:10] hallelujah
[53:12] so we have to understand what the lord
[53:13] has done for us
[53:15] in this day listen let's go back
[53:20] listen he says and what christ
[53:24] and what was christ separating from what
[53:27] did he separate us from
[53:29] he said the bible said he was wounded
[53:31] for our transgressions hallelujah
[53:34] when he loosed us hungry he loosed us
[53:37] from our transgressions
[53:38] oh my he said he was bruised for our
[53:41] iniquity
[53:42] he loosed us from knowing to do right
[53:45] and still do wrong hallelujah
[53:47] hurray see iniquities know to do right
[53:49] and still do wrong
[53:51] he said the chastisement of our peace
[53:53] was upon him
[53:54] and with his stripes we were separated
[53:58] from our diseases we were loosed from
[54:00] every disease
[54:01] through the acceptance of jesus christ
[54:04] so as we were loose
[54:05] we were sealed in him hallelujah that's
[54:08] why church
[54:09] it's it's it's it's a complete act
[54:11] hollywood you repent
[54:13] you're baptized and then you're sealed
[54:15] with the holy ghost
[54:16] oh my think about it as soon as you can
[54:19] repent
[54:20] hallelujah in that very same moment you
[54:22] can be sealed
[54:26] we are the ones who's holding things up
[54:28] holy
[54:29] it's simultaneously oh my
[54:33] he said separated from our sins
[54:36] separated from our weary
[54:38] separated from our iniquity and
[54:40] separated from our sins
[54:42] by the word which was christ was made
[54:45] flesh and dwelt among us
[54:47] the word became flesh and the flesh
[54:50] was broke that the blood cell was broken
[54:53] loose
[54:54] that the believer could be brought
[54:56] through the spray
[54:57] hallelujah of the blood from calvary
[55:00] hallelujah
[55:01] we will lose hallelujah through the
[55:03] death burial
[55:04] of jesus christ and at the same time
[55:07] we're sealed
[55:08] to the death burial of jesus christ
[55:12] oh my that excites me church listen

[56:23] we get caught up hallelujah and how beat
[56:25] up we are
[56:26] house how the struggle is what we're
[56:28] going to do and everything
[56:30] none of that changes the sale
[56:38] who cares what it looks like
[56:42] as long as the seal is intact
[56:45] hallelujah and you know sometimes right
[56:48] now this bottle is cold
[56:50] even when you're cold the seal will
[56:52] remain holy
[56:54] and if i leave it outside in 90 90
[56:56] degrees weather in the summertime
[56:59] even when it's hot earlier it looks like
[57:01] the bottle is changing forms
[57:03] that doesn't break the seal
[57:07] oh my it's at simultaneous work
[57:11] hallelujah but look he says what is a
[57:14] seal
[57:15] what is a seal a seal first
[57:19] figures shows is a work that has been
[57:22] completed oh my
[57:24] now let's go into revelations when this
[57:26] lamb came
[57:27] and he broke the seals what were he
[57:28] saying when he took the book
[57:30] when he took the book we know that book
[57:32] represents redemption hallelujah
[57:34] so when he took the book he was telling
[57:36] the whole world
[57:37] the work over your life is finished
[57:40] hallelujah
[57:41] whatever you are supposed to be
[57:43] according to god
[57:44] it is finished hallelujah he don't have
[57:47] to add nothing to you
[57:48] you have to take nothing from you
[57:50] everything you
[57:51] are is wrapped up in that shield
[57:56] hallelujah he said it shows
[57:59] a work that has been completed a
[58:02] completed work he says
[58:03] the next thing it shows is ownership
[58:06] hallelujah
[58:07] i wish one of y'all would come try to
[58:09] break my cell
[58:12] this belongs to me hallelujah and
[58:14] because it's mine
[58:16] i'm the only one who got the right to
[58:18] lose the seat wow
[58:22] i'm the only one that got the right to
[58:23] loose the seal
[58:26] christ is the only one that has the
[58:28] right over your life
[58:30] to lose hallelujah the dynamics of jesus
[58:33] christ
[58:33] in your life holy do you think about
[58:36] this church i'm gonna make a statement
[58:38] right now
[58:38] and it's gonna shake your boots don't
[58:40] you realize once you realize who you are
[58:43] satan knows he can't do anything with
[58:45] you
[58:49] hallelujah he said it shows ownership
[58:53] and the next thing it shows and this is
[58:55] the one i love he said the next thing it
[58:57] shows
[58:58] it shows security
[59:01] y'all see me just drop that bottle as
[59:04] long as i know the seal hasn't been
[59:05] broken
[59:06] i ain't worried about it
[59:10] and some of us drop the ball some of us
[59:13] fall short daily
[59:14] but if there's a seal over your life god
[59:17] is not worrying about
[59:18] it hallelujah just as fast as you fall
[59:20] down
[59:21] there's something simultaneously working
[59:23] in your life to pick you up hallelujah
[59:25] think about it like this hallelujah god
[59:27] will allow you to fall
[59:29] just so he can pick you up
[59:34] he works simultaneously like that holly
[59:37] at the same time
[59:38] while he was giving judgment in noah's
[59:40] day he was given grace
[59:42] in noah's day hallelujah a simultaneous
[59:46] work hallelujah
[59:48] why somehow you were receiving judgment
[59:50] others were receiving grace
[59:52] in the very same moment think about it
[59:57] so don't just get one track in your mind
[59:59] to only say god can do this in my life
[1:00:01] don't you realize every step
[1:00:04] joseph made that looked like a trial was
[1:00:07] a step of victory
[1:00:12] now i'm going to shake your boots again
[1:00:14] you know when joseph was sold into
[1:00:16] slavery
[1:00:17] that was a victory
[1:00:21] oh he said brothers how can you say that
[1:00:23] holy because his life
[1:00:25] was a type of christ earlier being sold
[1:00:28] for 30 pieces of silver
[1:00:30] here just like christ was sold for 30
[1:00:33] pieces of silver or whatever the account
[1:00:34] was
[1:00:35] he was in his trial here he was a type
[1:00:38] of christ
[1:00:40] what are you typing in your trial
[1:00:42] [Music]
[1:00:44] look at how many people go through
[1:00:46] things daily
[1:00:47] and we can't even see that it's christ
[1:00:49] in the midst of it
[1:00:54] first thing we say is oh the devil no
[1:00:57] it's a simultaneous work holy
[1:01:01] if i could make it even more clearer the
[1:01:03] prophet of god said
[1:01:04] amen for us hallelujah to receive
[1:01:07] healing hallelujah something must be
[1:01:09] sick holly
[1:01:11] so sickness is there so that healing can
[1:01:14] work simon
[1:01:19] sickness is there just so healing can
[1:01:22] work at the same time
[1:01:27] praise god oh my
[1:01:30] why do we have sad days just so god can
[1:01:33] show us
[1:01:33] happy days
[1:01:36] why do we have bondage just so god can
[1:01:40] simultaneously
[1:01:41] bring us deliverance church the negative
[1:01:45] and positive
[1:01:46] are always coexisting together
[1:01:49] right now in this room we have light in
[1:01:52] here because we have a negative
[1:01:54] and a positive working together
[1:01:58] glory adios
[1:02:04] so church i look at things a little
[1:02:06] different now
[1:02:08] when i realize what god has done when he
[1:02:11] came nobody was worthy
[1:02:13] to lose the seals thereof and when he
[1:02:16] came and he took the book
[1:02:18] he loosed the seals what did he do he
[1:02:20] set us free
[1:02:22] hallelujah he put us back in his hand
[1:02:25] what did he do he released his nature
[1:02:28] over our lives because remember here
[1:02:33] the one who took the book when you read
[1:02:35] it he said
[1:02:36] and it was it was a lamb as though it
[1:02:38] had been slain hallelujah
[1:02:40] so what was it taking that life what
[1:02:42] took your life back
[1:02:44] it was blood wow
[1:02:48] it was the blood of jesus that loosed
[1:02:51] you and set you free
[1:02:52] it was the blood of jesus that seals you
[1:02:55] to the day of your redemption
[1:02:59] because the life is where in the blood
[1:03:03] hallelujah glory and i know we've heard
[1:03:06] these things
[1:03:08] hallelujah before but i want you to
[1:03:10] catch something amen
[1:03:12] he says and the next thing it shows is
[1:03:15] security holy keeping it hallelujah
[1:03:19] see if god ever does anything in your
[1:03:21] life he can never take it back
[1:03:26] at least i was gonna get two amens out
[1:03:28] of that
[1:03:31] we serve a god who can't backtrack
[1:03:34] holy we serve a god hallelujah
[1:03:38] that can't even rethink what he's
[1:03:39] already thought
[1:03:42] but that's heavy ain't it he can't even
[1:03:45] rethink what he's already thought
[1:03:47] his first thought about you is perfect
[1:03:51] oh my the first act hallelujah
[1:03:54] of introducing himself to you is perfect
[1:03:57] hallelujah
[1:03:58] he can't come back and reintroduce
[1:04:00] himself highly
[1:04:01] the first way he does it hallelujah is
[1:04:04] the right way
[1:04:05] it's a place of security
[1:04:09] knowing god is a place of security
[1:04:12] think about the church we should wake up
[1:04:14] every day
[1:04:15] and enter into his rest
[1:04:19] because it ain't us doing it hallelujah
[1:04:21] it ain't us making it happen
[1:04:23] what is it hallelujah it's that lamb
[1:04:25] that loosed the seals over your life
[1:04:27] he loosed the seal and then he put a
[1:04:30] seal
[1:04:33] let's make it even more plain remember
[1:04:36] don't get nervous i'm about to close
[1:04:38] remember in in in in exodus
[1:04:43] when pharaoh and moses was going at it
[1:04:48] like two alpha males holy the only
[1:04:51] difference was
[1:04:52] one was a spiritual alpha male and one
[1:04:55] was a natural alpha male
[1:04:57] holly and moses moses said god said
[1:05:02] apply the blood over your doorpost
[1:05:08] and pharaoh's like i never heard of a
[1:05:10] god i'm god
[1:05:12] he's carrying on terrible did moses fret
[1:05:16] no he knew that that blood
[1:05:19] was a silly
[1:05:23] and he didn't have to stand there and
[1:05:25] wait he didn't have to guard the door
[1:05:27] close
[1:05:28] what guarded it from death it was the
[1:05:31] seal of the blood
[1:05:32] wow holly amen as long as they stayed
[1:05:35] behind
[1:05:36] the blood everybody was protected
[1:05:39] everybody
[1:05:39] look at the church everybody in that
[1:05:42] house
[1:05:43] so when you apply the blood to your
[1:05:45] house everybody is sealed
[1:05:48] everybody is protected honey everybody
[1:05:51] is comforted
[1:05:52] by their blood that you have applied
[1:05:56] oh my god what i want you to catch
[1:05:59] church
[1:06:00] it wasn't it wasn't just just just the
[1:06:03] the older the oldest one the oldest male
[1:06:06] that was being protected it was that
[1:06:08] whole house
[1:06:12] because you think about it you may have
[1:06:13] had two
[1:06:15] oldest children in that house but the
[1:06:17] blood protected each one that was in
[1:06:19] that house
[1:06:21] hallelujah and you know church as the
[1:06:23] deaf angel and i like to type it out
[1:06:25] like this
[1:06:25] as the deaf angel begin to go and go
[1:06:28] around
[1:06:29] everything hallelujah in the spiritual
[1:06:31] realm hallelujah
[1:06:33] it would either it would either it would
[1:06:35] either blend with death
[1:06:36] or it would meet an angel of life
[1:06:41] according to what was on the door and if
[1:06:44] blood was on the door
[1:06:46] hallelujah the deaf angel made an angel
[1:06:48] of life hallelujah
[1:06:50] and you know what the and the deaf
[1:06:52] angels will say give me passage
[1:06:54] let me come through hallelujah and the
[1:06:56] angel of life will say don't you see
[1:06:58] what's on the door
[1:06:59] holly i'm here to protect this house
[1:07:03] hallelujah it ain't you protecting
[1:07:05] yourself it's the blood of jesus
[1:07:07] hallelujah it's the revelation of jesus
[1:07:09] christ hallelujah
[1:07:11] it's that blood simultaneously
[1:07:13] hallelujah
[1:07:14] doing the work in your life in church in
[1:07:17] that moment holy
[1:07:19] that angel of life early standing there
[1:07:21] as the deaf angel is coming
[1:07:23] and he's saying let me through he said
[1:07:25] no this house belongs to god
[1:07:30] wow in church we have that same seal
[1:07:37] and no matter what you have done no
[1:07:40] matter how much satan accuses you
[1:07:42] amen the prophet of god saying god sees
[1:07:45] none of that all he sees is the seal
[1:07:48] of his own life
[1:07:50] [Music]
[1:07:53] that made me want to shout
[1:08:07] cause you know we spend so much time
[1:08:09] thinking about lord if i could do this
[1:08:11] lord if i could do that lord make me
[1:08:13] more like this lord maybe more like that
[1:08:15] and that's all right but just realize if
[1:08:18] you get there it ain't going to be your
[1:08:19] own efforts
[1:08:23] hallelujah it's going to be loosening
[1:08:26] hallelujah the loosening of that bondage
[1:08:30] the loosening of all that trouble
[1:08:31] hallelujah because remember earlier
[1:08:33] for god to even get to you he had to
[1:08:36] loose you first
[1:08:41] loose you from your worldly nature
[1:08:46] because as long as you had that seal
[1:08:48] over your life
[1:08:49] that seal of sin god couldn't even get
[1:08:52] close to you holly
[1:08:53] so that's why he died poured out his
[1:08:55] life and
[1:08:56] sealed you through the blood of the lamb
[1:09:00] and his blood changed our nature
[1:09:03] changed our thoughts change our desires
[1:09:06] huh
[1:09:07] see are you catching what a seal is
[1:09:11] see as long as it's sealed nothing can
[1:09:13] get in
[1:09:15] and nothing can get out
[1:09:22] oh god i'm falling short
[1:09:26] nothing can get in nothing can get out
[1:09:30] oh god my prayer life is not what it
[1:09:33] should
[1:09:34] be nothing can get in
[1:09:38] nothing can get out oh god
[1:09:41] i just went to the doctor and they said
[1:09:43] i got diabetes
[1:09:45] let me ask you a question are you sealed
[1:09:50] if you're sealed nothing can get in
[1:09:56] and nothing can get out
[1:10:02] you might even trip up sometime oh
[1:10:07] but when god finds you what does he find
[1:10:11] he finds that seal
[1:10:19] let's keep going i'm coming down
[1:10:24] listen we know the story
[1:10:29] of a box car
[1:10:32] now you got all kind of stuff in a box
[1:10:34] car traveling from state to state
[1:10:36] right they may say that's the safest way
[1:10:39] to to send some things cross-country
[1:10:42] but before it even before it even goes
[1:10:45] on this journey
[1:10:46] it's inspected
[1:10:49] and what you have to realize a lot of
[1:10:52] times
[1:10:54] when things are put in a box car it's
[1:10:56] not spacious
[1:10:59] it's very tight and jammed up in there
[1:11:03] it can even be a little uncomfortable
[1:11:05] for the thing that's traveling holiday
[1:11:07] sometimes it gets a little smashed
[1:11:10] sometimes it gets a little cut
[1:11:12] sometimes it gets a little damaged
[1:11:13] hallelujah but all that happens on the
[1:11:16] journey
[1:11:17] hallelujah before it can even go take
[1:11:20] off
[1:11:20] it has to be sealed and the inspector
[1:11:23] has to approve it hallelujah and what he
[1:11:26] does he goes and he inspects the boss
[1:11:28] car
[1:11:28] and he makes sure everything is in
[1:11:30] position where it's supposed to be
[1:11:32] and he's not he doesn't care holly his
[1:11:35] job
[1:11:36] is not to stop it every quarter of a
[1:11:38] mile and see if everything is in place
[1:11:41] that's not his job his job this is to be
[1:11:44] good now
[1:11:45] hallelujah before i close his job is to
[1:11:48] make sure
[1:11:49] you're fit for the journey
[1:11:54] hallelujah so when he seals you what is
[1:11:57] he saying hallelujah
[1:11:59] he's not worrying about the in-between
[1:12:01] hallelujah he has
[1:12:02] papers to meet you at the destination
[1:12:06] he's not worried about everything in the
[1:12:07] middle hallelujah he knows you here
[1:12:10] and he knows you over here hallelujah at
[1:12:13] this
[1:12:13] finish line holly and when he opens that
[1:12:17] box car hallelujah
[1:12:18] he expects to see hallelujah what he
[1:12:21] started
[1:12:22] with not something different hallelujah
[1:12:25] it doesn't take on another form
[1:12:27] hallelujah
[1:12:29] but he's expecting the same product he
[1:12:32] started off with
[1:12:35] think about that church god
[1:12:38] is expecting the same product he started
[1:12:41] off with
[1:12:44] he said brothers i was born in sin but
[1:12:46] let me say it like just
[1:12:48] before i was born and sinned holly i was
[1:12:51] birthed in the mind of god
[1:12:55] wow and every thought god had about me
[1:12:59] hallelujah was pure amen every thought
[1:13:02] god had about me
[1:13:04] was innocent hallelujah every god every
[1:13:07] thought
[1:13:07] god had about me was holy hallelujah
[1:13:10] every thought god had about me
[1:13:12] hallelujah was a supernatural thought
[1:13:17] every thought god had about me was
[1:13:20] victory and not defeat
[1:13:21] remember the bible says holy for he
[1:13:24] knows the thoughts he has concerning you
[1:13:26] thoughts of peace and not of evil
[1:13:30] so if you're receiving more evil harder
[1:13:33] than peace
[1:13:34] you're not tapping into god's mind
[1:13:37] holiday
[1:13:38] listen he says
[1:13:41] say for instance i used to work for
[1:13:44] a pennsylvania railroad i used to work
[1:13:47] with my father on the railroad
[1:13:49] we were we were load cars
[1:13:52] and we were put down here in this
[1:13:55] packing company
[1:13:56] we put in 10 cans now you know how thin
[1:13:59] a tin can is
[1:14:03] very thin but they packed them up hardly
[1:14:07] and sent them on a journey hallelujah
[1:14:10] he said and we set some up here and some
[1:14:13] down here
[1:14:14] and sum up this way hallelujah he says
[1:14:17] the holy ghost is the inspector
[1:14:20] hallelujah he shake you a little bit
[1:14:23] hallelujah
[1:14:24] and rattle you hallelujah because you
[1:14:26] think about those tin cans hallelujah
[1:14:28] they're making a sound while they're
[1:14:30] traveling hallelujah
[1:14:31] and they're just shaking and tingling
[1:14:33] and doing all these things
[1:14:34] hallelujah but the inspector's not
[1:14:36] worried about that
[1:14:38] what he's worried about is the position
[1:14:40] he placed him in
[1:14:43] wow hallelujah church and if we make it
[1:14:47] to heaven
[1:14:48] we'll make it there by our adoption
[1:14:51] by our spiritual position hallelujah you
[1:14:54] won't make it by your worldly material
[1:14:56] you won't make it by the knowledge of
[1:14:58] your mind holy you'll make it by
[1:15:00] accepting
[1:15:00] the position god originally ordained you
[1:15:03] for
[1:15:05] hallelujah oh my he says but
[1:15:09] says but now the seals listen to us
[1:15:13] are open the spirit of truth
[1:15:16] directs us to the word that explains why
[1:15:20] we
[1:15:21] all the mistakes has been down through
[1:15:23] the ages
[1:15:24] because the seals was not open
[1:15:27] hallelujah
[1:15:28] this was not revealed it's true holy
[1:15:31] so god had to come helluya and
[1:15:34] loose every seal why so we could walk in
[1:15:38] truth
[1:15:40] because luther he had a form of truth
[1:15:43] but not all truth
[1:15:44] wesley had a form of truth but not all
[1:15:47] truth pentecost had a form of truth
[1:15:49] but not all truth so in our day he came
[1:15:52] with a message hallelujah
[1:15:54] loosing the seals of your life why so we
[1:15:57] could walk in complete truth
[1:16:00] and it's only truth that will get us
[1:16:03] back to god hallelujah
[1:16:05] why because he says i am the truth
[1:16:10] i am the way i am the door i am the
[1:16:12] light hallelujah
[1:16:14] see church will loose to be sealed all
[1:16:17] over again
[1:16:20] oh my listen he says but oh brother
[1:16:27] when it was sprinkled that day
[1:16:30] when the blood of jesus christ a spirit
[1:16:33] of god written the seal
[1:16:35] from the top to the bottom and brought
[1:16:37] man back
[1:16:38] not only kept him away from the presence
[1:16:40] of god but he brought him back
[1:16:43] into the shekinah glory into the
[1:16:45] presence of god
[1:16:46] that he his his dead life
[1:16:50] when he offered his life the power of
[1:16:52] sin was broken
[1:16:54] because now man could be forgiven
[1:16:57] forever
[1:16:58] with a clear conscience oh yeah
[1:17:02] think about it church god had to lose us
[1:17:05] from the evil thoughts that we were born
[1:17:07] with
[1:17:09] so he had to come church he had to give
[1:17:12] his life
[1:17:12] holier pouring his nature into us
[1:17:16] sealing us to walk in divine truth
[1:17:18] hallelujah
[1:17:19] to walk by his divine nature so now we
[1:17:22] can do
[1:17:23] what the scripture says hallelujah seek
[1:17:25] on these things
[1:17:27] whatsoever is honest is pure whatsoever
[1:17:30] is of a good report
[1:17:31] the only way we can do that hallelujah
[1:17:34] is receiving the seal of the holy ghost
[1:17:39] oh my church
[1:17:44] one thing i want us to catch if you ever
[1:17:47] get the holy ghost
[1:17:49] you can never lose it
[1:17:55] are you gonna make mistakes yeah
[1:17:58] are you going to feel guilty yeah
[1:18:02] but you can never lose that seal
[1:18:06] because even jesus had thoughts that
[1:18:09] wasn't of god
[1:18:14] there you go amen yet
[1:18:18] without saying right honey
[1:18:22] he was tempted at all points all matters
[1:18:24] just like we was yet
[1:18:26] without sin church he was right in his
[1:18:29] position
[1:18:30] to loose us over all for decades to
[1:18:33] decades
[1:18:34] and in that moment of transition
[1:18:36] hallelujah a spirit came to him
[1:18:39] and say ask god to take this cup from
[1:18:41] you
[1:18:45] but a simultaneous work was occurring at
[1:18:47] the same time
[1:18:49] while the devil was trying to get him to
[1:18:50] deny it god was dealing with him saying
[1:18:53] accept it hallelujah
[1:18:54] accept this work that i've given to you
[1:18:56] hallelujah so in that very moment
[1:18:59] hallelujah god accepts her
[1:19:03] what he's supposed to do and he dies to
[1:19:05] death and he changes our lives forever
[1:19:09] never have to go back to being in
[1:19:12] bondage again why
[1:19:13] because we've been loosed and we've been
[1:19:16] set free
[1:19:17] but at the same time we've been sealed
[1:19:20] hallelujah and a seal a security
[1:19:25] a seal hallelujah a seal is is a
[1:19:28] complete work
[1:19:30] and a seal shows ownership so when i'm
[1:19:33] thinking
[1:19:33] when we're talking about the holy ghost
[1:19:36] and you're wondering if you're sealed
[1:19:37] holy
[1:19:38] you know the prophet god said hallelujah
[1:19:41] that this
[1:19:41] message of the hour holy has the power
[1:19:45] to change you holy
[1:19:48] transforming power hallelujah this word
[1:19:52] this message has the power to change you
[1:19:54] into what
[1:19:55] what god originally ordained you to be
[1:20:00] it's just as simple as that that's what
[1:20:02] the message of god is doing
[1:20:04] hallelujah it's bringing you back to
[1:20:06] your rightful predict position hardly
[1:20:09] simultaneously in safety
[1:20:18] oh my the only power satan has
[1:20:22] is what you give to him
[1:20:26] and some of y'all making him very
[1:20:30] powerful when god has already set you
[1:20:33] free
[1:20:35] when god deserves already we sing that
[1:20:37] song break every chain
[1:20:38] holy he's already broken every chain
[1:20:42] he's already loose you'll set you free
[1:20:44] harley
[1:20:45] then he comes back hallelujah he comes
[1:20:48] back and look what he did
[1:20:50] in in in a servant seal there's no
[1:20:52] particular angel or anybody talking in
[1:20:54] that seventh seal
[1:20:55] it considers to be a mystery hallelujah
[1:20:57] and you know
[1:20:58] and because it's not so direct it's a
[1:21:01] revelation
[1:21:02] people would look at it and they say the
[1:21:03] seventh seal laid open
[1:21:07] but he said he came to loose the seals
[1:21:09] thereof
[1:21:10] the seven seals thereof so he didn't
[1:21:13] just stop at
[1:21:14] six but you have to see where you are
[1:21:17] hallelujah listen now
[1:21:20] and i like to make it plain like this
[1:21:22] because we hear so much about this
[1:21:24] the first four seals what was it it was
[1:21:27] identifying the antichrist
[1:21:30] talk to me church you supposed to notice
[1:21:34] this stuff has been preached for 50
[1:21:36] years
[1:21:37] hallelujah go ahead when we talk
[1:21:41] and and the preaching of the seals and
[1:21:43] the thunders and all these things
[1:21:45] is like the foundation of who we are so
[1:21:47] when we hear these revelations
[1:21:49] we are to say amen hallelujah
[1:21:53] and without god showing the prophet
[1:21:56] exactly where it was
[1:21:57] he would have said the wrong thing but
[1:22:00] because
[1:22:02] it wasn't a man loosening the seals
[1:22:04] hallelujah
[1:22:05] it was christ loosening his heels so he
[1:22:09] had to come
[1:22:10] and give brother branham his thoughts
[1:22:14] because brother branham couldn't lose it
[1:22:15] hallelujah he would have been saying the
[1:22:18] wrong thing
[1:22:19] he was looking at hallelujah the first
[1:22:21] horse rider
[1:22:22] and was about to say it was christ
[1:22:25] the church would have still been in
[1:22:27] bondage
[1:22:30] and throughout the years that's what men
[1:22:32] have preached earlier
[1:22:34] but then he said a message will come
[1:22:37] that will loose the people
[1:22:38] hallelujah church
[1:22:42] if we look at it right
[1:22:45] and i hope some of you
[1:22:48] message believers that maybe have left
[1:22:50] the message are watching
[1:22:53] because i want you to catch this the
[1:22:55] message didn't come
[1:22:57] to put us in bondage but it came to set
[1:23:00] us free
[1:23:03] hallelujah and when you get the seal
[1:23:07] which is the nature of christ hallelujah
[1:23:10] you don't mind dressing right right
[1:23:13] you don't mind acting right you don't
[1:23:15] mind doing the things you're supposed to
[1:23:17] do
[1:23:17] why because it's not you it's the nature
[1:23:20] of that seal
[1:23:24] hallelujah and the reason why some
[1:23:27] people could not
[1:23:28] live this message is because they don't
[1:23:30] have the nature of the seal hallelujah
[1:23:36] and they look at the message as bondage
[1:23:38] hallelujah
[1:23:39] when the message came to bring us out of
[1:23:41] bondage
[1:23:43] holy because the scripture clearly says
[1:23:45] hollywood
[1:23:46] that when this messenger comes
[1:23:48] revelations uh
[1:23:49] 18 and 4 i believe he says come out of
[1:23:52] her my people
[1:23:54] so what is what is this message doing
[1:23:56] when it's first being proclaimed
[1:23:58] is bringing forth a loosening
[1:24:03] and at the same time it's doing a
[1:24:06] loosening hallelujah
[1:24:07] it's doing a ceiling
[1:24:11] glory and for those of us that catch it
[1:24:15] we rejoice because we say i'm not the
[1:24:17] person i used to be
[1:24:19] i don't do the things i used to do what
[1:24:21] happens hallelujah
[1:24:22] you're loosed and then you're
[1:24:23] simultaneously sealed hardly
[1:24:26] glory that's what it does that's why the
[1:24:29] holy ghost
[1:24:30] is living the word for your day
[1:24:33] hallelujah that's the ceiling amen you
[1:24:36] living the message for your day the
[1:24:39] message for my day is not
[1:24:40] it's gonna rain
[1:24:45] although that's true that did happen in
[1:24:49] noah's day
[1:24:50] hallelujah that was a move of god holly
[1:24:54] you know the the the message for my day
[1:24:57] holy
[1:24:58] is not hardly a moses saying heart let
[1:25:00] my people go no
[1:25:03] the message for my day is
[1:25:06] taking on the character of christ
[1:25:11] and let it have full reign in your being
[1:25:14] amen church if i can say it in simpler
[1:25:17] terms
[1:25:18] what is it it is submission
[1:25:23] lord here i am
[1:25:27] do with me as you will that's how you
[1:25:30] know if you really got to seal
[1:25:32] holly because the only thing that
[1:25:34] controls the something's inside
[1:25:36] is me
[1:25:40] the only way i can come out is the one
[1:25:42] who got ownership lets it out
[1:25:45] the only way something can come in is
[1:25:47] the one who has ownership let's sit here
[1:25:49] as long as i have it it's secure harley
[1:25:52] everything hallelujah that belongs to me
[1:25:55] in this bottle is mine and all mine and
[1:25:57] nobody can do nothing about it
[1:26:00] if you try to take it out my hand will
[1:26:02] have to fight
[1:26:07] don't you know that's how god feel about
[1:26:09] you
[1:26:10] if satan tries to take you out of his
[1:26:12] hand
[1:26:13] he's up for a fight and you know what
[1:26:17] god has never been defeated
[1:26:22] church is not worried about the journey
[1:26:25] no as long as you leave with a seal
[1:26:29] god is okay
[1:26:30] [Music]
[1:26:35] there's nothing like taking a journey
[1:26:37] without a seal
[1:26:42] because it's just like a car being
[1:26:44] flipped
[1:26:45] and you don't have on a seat belt you
[1:26:48] don't have any kind of security
[1:26:51] you have any kind of hope of surviving
[1:26:54] but with the seat belt at least it will
[1:26:56] keep you in place
[1:26:58] you might break a home but at least
[1:27:00] you'll keep you in place
[1:27:02] you might hit your knee on the steering
[1:27:03] wheel but at least it'll keep you in
[1:27:05] place
[1:27:06] holly you have a lot of injuries but at
[1:27:08] least hallelujah
[1:27:10] you could not be moved wow
[1:27:15] all right i don't know my child but i
[1:27:19] got a lot of scars
[1:27:20] but my scars show victory hallelujah
[1:27:24] amen i got scars of cancer in my brain
[1:27:27] victory hallelujah i got testimonies of
[1:27:32] of struggles and trials that god brought
[1:27:34] me through
[1:27:35] victory all these things that happened
[1:27:38] on the journey
[1:27:39] but it couldn't stop me from getting to
[1:27:41] my destination
[1:27:42] amen the worst thing you can do
[1:27:46] is go on a journey with no seal
[1:27:52] cause you can imagine sometimes things
[1:27:54] get stuck on the track
[1:27:58] and it's hard for a train to stop
[1:28:01] and not just out of 10 it's going to
[1:28:03] collide with it hardly
[1:28:04] and if the product is not sealed it's
[1:28:07] going to be thrown all over the place
[1:28:09] hardly are you catching me see how
[1:28:12] important the holy ghost is
[1:28:14] the holy ghost will keep you in time of
[1:28:18] struggle
[1:28:19] holy the holy ghost will keep you place
[1:28:22] no matter how you might look after the
[1:28:26] journey
[1:28:28] might have some some so some tin cans
[1:28:30] that you know uh
[1:28:31] come out of it come out of there lightly
[1:28:37] but it still was in place when it got
[1:28:40] there
[1:28:42] some of us going to come out with scars
[1:28:45] and wounds hallelujah
[1:28:47] but we're going to come out as
[1:28:48] overcomers
[1:28:50] hallelujah listen to the church he would
[1:28:53] never put that in the scripture
[1:28:55] hello how he grant you and i
[1:28:58] he that overcome he never put that there
[1:29:01] he never used the word overcome if we
[1:29:04] didn't have something to overcome
[1:29:07] hell yeah so god puts things there he
[1:29:10] puts the word
[1:29:11] overcome there simultaneously while
[1:29:14] we're overcoming
[1:29:18] whoa oh my church remember
[1:29:21] remember why i'm closing simultaneously
[1:29:24] existing occurring or
[1:29:27] operating at the same time
[1:29:30] and remember when job and the sons of
[1:29:33] god all of them came to present
[1:29:34] themselves before god
[1:29:36] who else was there amen
[1:29:40] the devil was there simultaneously
[1:29:43] at the same time while god is receiving
[1:29:45] worship satan is there trying to stop
[1:29:48] the worship
[1:29:49] and the only way you could not get
[1:29:51] anything out of this service
[1:29:53] is if you allow the enemy to have your
[1:29:56] mind
[1:29:58] you got to walk out of here saying i'm
[1:30:00] sealed
[1:30:03] you can't you know when something's
[1:30:05] sealed you can't touch it
[1:30:12] yeah i know it's water in here i wanna
[1:30:14] touch it
[1:30:18] is water in here how do you know
[1:30:22] i want to touch it though what's
[1:30:24] stopping me from touching it
[1:30:26] seal satan can look at you
[1:30:32] he want to get to you but he can't touch
[1:30:34] you you know why
[1:30:35] because of the seal of god
[1:30:42] oh my church oh i call you this is not
[1:30:45] closing
[1:30:45] think about it hallelujah he wants to
[1:30:47] take all of us through battles
[1:30:49] but he can't get past the seal
[1:30:53] and the problem of god said hallelujah
[1:30:55] if satan can get past the seal
[1:30:58] then he'd be your brother
[1:31:02] oh my so check yourself
[1:31:06] if you find yourself doing things that's
[1:31:08] not
[1:31:09] worthy of the nature of god you better
[1:31:12] check whether you're sealed or not
[1:31:14] because satan can't get past the seal so
[1:31:17] if you're doing things that doesn't
[1:31:18] reflect the nature of god
[1:31:20] that might mean you're not sealed
[1:31:23] hallelujah in my closing last thing i'm
[1:31:25] gonna read
[1:31:28] he said this should be light in the
[1:31:29] evening time i don't care
[1:31:32] how many seals you try to put over it
[1:31:35] god will break every seal he broke the
[1:31:39] seal
[1:31:39] hollya of the tomb he broke the seal of
[1:31:42] hell
[1:31:43] he broke the seal of death he broke the
[1:31:45] seal of the grave
[1:31:47] and rose forevermore and triumphed over
[1:31:49] the grave
[1:31:50] death hail tombs every man made things
[1:31:53] there was
[1:31:54] to show that he was god and cannot be
[1:31:57] sealed
[1:31:58] cannot be sealed away
[1:32:02] wow think about that church if you
[1:32:04] belong to god
[1:32:06] there's nothing you can do that will
[1:32:07] keep god away from you
[1:32:12] i feel my helper coming on oh my
[1:32:15] we might look at ourselves and say i'm
[1:32:17] so unworthy
[1:32:18] but god is saying how can i get to you
[1:32:20] let me tell you holy
[1:32:22] there's nothing hurt that you could ever
[1:32:24] do that'll keep
[1:32:26] god from coming to your rescue
[1:32:31] hallelujah i'm gonna read that again
[1:32:34] he says in triumphs over the grave death
[1:32:37] hail
[1:32:37] tombs and every man-made thing that was
[1:32:40] to show that he was god and cannot be
[1:32:44] sealed away
[1:32:45] from the people anymore
[1:32:48] so i'll say tonight whatever's
[1:32:51] whatever's troubling you
[1:32:53] is not strong enough to keep god away
[1:32:55] from you
[1:32:56] right now in this moment
[1:33:02] why because he's already broken every
[1:33:04] seal
[1:33:06] he's already loosed every bondage and
[1:33:08] now all he's wanting to do
[1:33:10] is to seal you up in him all over again
[1:33:13] to show you what a real seal is
[1:33:16] wow to show you what real protection is
[1:33:19] to show you what real
[1:33:20] ownership is all right to show you what
[1:33:23] a real complete work is
[1:33:26] oh my listen he says god forevermore
[1:33:31] nothing can hold him the grave could oh
[1:33:35] the grave couldn't hold him and remember
[1:33:38] you know what they would do
[1:33:40] when they have uh deaths and and
[1:33:43] crucifixions
[1:33:44] they gonna put it in a grave they put a
[1:33:46] rock and they seal it
[1:33:48] did it whole god couldn't hold him
[1:33:52] grey the grave hell of death couldn't
[1:33:55] hold out god
[1:33:56] away from doing hallelujah his
[1:33:59] redemptive claims
[1:34:02] holy he said the grave couldn't hold him
[1:34:06] he said the grave couldn't be dug deep
[1:34:08] enough
[1:34:10] there's not a sin you can go through
[1:34:12] that's deep enough where god can't reach
[1:34:16] you
[1:34:19] he said hell wouldn't be hot enough oh
[1:34:22] my
[1:34:22] oh nothing could hold him he broke every
[1:34:25] seal with a great
[1:34:27] hollywood christmas seal or not
[1:34:29] christmas seal
[1:34:30] but easter seal that he was sealed with
[1:34:33] and he said the same seal that i wear
[1:34:37] you shall wear also for that and that
[1:34:40] seal that i wear
[1:34:42] it shall do the same things when you are
[1:34:45] sealed
[1:34:46] hallelujah because remember he says
[1:34:47] hallelujah is that spirit
[1:34:49] that raised up christ from the dead it
[1:34:51] shall do what
[1:34:52] it shall also quicken your what
[1:34:56] your mortal body not your theophany
[1:34:59] honey now when you get on the other side
[1:35:01] so there's a ceiling
[1:35:03] that we ought to experience over on this
[1:35:06] side
[1:35:07] because he said you're a mortal body
[1:35:10] there's a life that we should live
[1:35:12] hallelujah above reproach
[1:35:14] on this side
[1:35:21] he says it shall do the same things when
[1:35:23] you are sealed for he
[1:35:25] that believeth in me the works that i do
[1:35:27] shall he do also
[1:35:29] even greater than thus shall he do for i
[1:35:32] go unto the father
[1:35:34] so church there is a simultaneously work
[1:35:38] going forth church at the same time
[1:35:42] where there's like covert 19 moving
[1:35:44] throughout the nation moving throughout
[1:35:46] the world
[1:35:47] hey man simultaneously there's a bomb in
[1:35:50] gilead
[1:35:53] hallelujah hey man look at it church we
[1:35:55] say oh my
[1:35:56] brother dicks it's real it's it's it's
[1:35:59] it's so real because i have
[1:36:01] christian loved ones who have died yeah
[1:36:03] and simultaneously
[1:36:05] they're there with the lord
[1:36:08] all right so it looks like they're going
[1:36:10] to death
[1:36:11] but yet they're living in christ so
[1:36:14] let's look at things in the right
[1:36:15] perspective
[1:36:17] don't let this fear and all this stuff
[1:36:19] overcome us amen
[1:36:20] there's nothing the enemy can do that
[1:36:22] will ever outdo
[1:36:24] god so you think about that while you're
[1:36:27] taking your vaccines
[1:36:35] i'ma just throw this one out there for
[1:36:36] free
[1:36:39] i'm gonna give you something to chew on
[1:36:40] for free
[1:36:42] somebody um i'll be at the gym working
[1:36:45] out
[1:36:46] and one of my friends say hey reb
[1:36:49] you gonna take the vaccine i say i treat
[1:36:52] it the same
[1:36:54] like i treated cancer when they said i
[1:36:57] had cancer they say
[1:36:59] take chemo take radiation i say for what
[1:37:02] buy stripes i'm healed so why i'ma take
[1:37:06] something proclaiming i'm sick when he
[1:37:07] already said i'm healed
[1:37:09] and then they look kind of puzzled so i
[1:37:11] said it real simple as have you ever
[1:37:13] heard old saying
[1:37:14] if it ain't broke then why try to fix it
[1:37:19] now you do whatever you want to do it's
[1:37:22] up to you
[1:37:23] he said it's according to your faith
[1:37:26] holy
[1:37:27] but my faith says i believe god
[1:37:32] that's how i say he said it says it kind
[1:37:34] of arrogant too i believe god
[1:37:37] i believe god i believe god
[1:37:41] i believe god i believe he's a healer
[1:37:44] hallelujah
[1:37:45] i believe he broke the seal of death
[1:37:47] hell in the grave
[1:37:49] i believe he possesses all healing power
[1:37:52] hallelujah
[1:37:52] i believe hallelujah when he died on the
[1:37:55] cross
[1:37:55] that every sickness every bondage
[1:37:58] everything that could ever overcome us
[1:38:00] was dealt with right in that moment
[1:38:04] and by his stripes
[1:38:07] i am not i will be not one day
[1:38:11] i am hallelujah glory to god
[1:38:15] amen let's all stand
[1:38:19] oh my simultaneously what i want you to
[1:38:22] do
[1:38:24] i want you to remember this word
[1:38:26] simultaneously
[1:38:28] whenever you feel like you're going
[1:38:29] through something
[1:38:31] holy if the devil is you feel like the
[1:38:33] devil is doing anything
[1:38:36] if he's doing anything god has to be
[1:38:39] doing everything
[1:38:42] because remember god created the devil
[1:38:47] so the only thing he could do is bring
[1:38:50] out more of god
[1:38:52] hallelujah because god won't be outdone
[1:38:55] so when things happen you have to just
[1:38:58] take a step back and say
[1:39:00] why is this happening what is god trying
[1:39:02] to show me
[1:39:04] i guarantee you if there's a move of
[1:39:07] evil there's also a move of good
[1:39:12] let's pray
[1:39:16] lord jesus father we thank you for your
[1:39:17] word

[1:43:00] rapture
[1:43:01] is in me now by the baptism
[1:43:05] of the holy spirit so many
[1:43:08] simultaneous things i thought about
[1:43:11] here we are in the darkest day of human
[1:43:14] history
[1:43:16] brother dawn but at the same time
[1:43:18] simultaneously
[1:43:19] it's the brightest day the bride has
[1:43:21] ever seen
[1:43:22] the complete mighty god unveiled and a
[1:43:25] bride
[1:43:26] walking in in in a in a
[1:43:30] as far as god is concerned and a
[1:43:32] complete perfection
[1:43:34] you're not maybe going to make the
[1:43:35] rapture you're going to make the rapture
[1:43:38] and there's nothing you can do about it
[1:43:40] amen praise the lord what an hour
[1:43:43] friends to see that god come in our day
[1:43:46] with cadre and he he
[1:43:49] while he while he commenced you know
[1:43:52] while he initiated a silence
[1:43:55] simultaneously he ended up silence yes

[1:43:59] my hallelujah friends he ended a silence
[1:44:03] down through the ages and
[1:44:04] and br and open up a word that the world

[1:44:21] was to turn you fully into the revealed
[1:44:24] word of this hour
[1:44:25] and that word is leaving the earth
[1:44:29] that's why you're going in a rapture not
[1:44:31] because you're smart enough
[1:44:33] or nice enough but because you have
[1:44:35] accepted the word and then
[1:44:37] accepting the word when a prophet came
[1:44:39] here
[1:44:40] he had strict instructions for the the
[1:44:43] strong angel
[1:44:44] was given very express instructions by
[1:44:47] the mighty angel
[1:44:49] make them eat the book hallelujah you
