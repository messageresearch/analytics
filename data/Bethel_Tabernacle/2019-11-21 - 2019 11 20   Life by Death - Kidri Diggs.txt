placed on the oblique even so tonight as we speak in Prelude nor the foul thoughts venture off in the wrong place lord help us to gather him can put them back on the abode thank you praise you Jesus name church say Amen amen praise the Lord if you have your Bibles let's um let's turn the Galatians the second chapter a man praise God chapter 2 let's just read um Galatians chapter 2 lists this reverse nineteen for I through the law am dead to the law that I might live unto God I am crucified with Christ nevertheless I live yet not i but Christ liveth in me and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God who loved me and gave himself for me I do not frustrate the grace of God for I for if righteousness come by the law then Christ is dead in vain amen I just love that scripture praise the Lord let's let's go to UM Philippians chapter 1 you probably pick up or catch up where I'm going tonight by these scriptures Philippians 1 Philippians chapter 1 let's start reading at verse 20 according to my earnest expectation and my hope that in nothing I shall be ashamed but that which all boldness as always so now also Christ shall be magnified in my body whether it be by life or by death for to me to live is Christ and to die is gain a mail order bless reading of His Word you can have your seats by the grace of God amen tonight my subject is a familiar subject but I just pray that God just you know make make it alive to us tonight you know I was I was I was here some some some weeks ago and brought Jason made a statement you know I was thinking about it coming down the road it is some about 95 95 you clear your mind you know and God just talks to you while you're going down that long highway but anyway you know I was thinking about the thought when he says he loves that message that day on Calvary you know and how thick and jam-packed that message is but the greatest thing about that is to get the revelation of Calvary and what it means to you as an individual you know tonight I just pray that God will shed some light on it but my subject is life by death amen life by death you know and that's the question that a lot of people have you know do we live after we die is there life after death and church even in in in in natural things that statement is made alive you know because sometimes we look at natural things we can see the rebirth of things or or the coming forth of the Resurrection in natural things but you know when we think about the death of Christ and what it means to you and I you know in him given his life he who knew no sin became sin so that we could become his righteousness why did he do that because we were on our way to a death of no redemption so God came he made a way that even if you die you still live hallelujah you know and that's what we call grace even though you deserve death God gives us life and you know church if I could just start in the natural room and how we look at the cycle of life and how did you know the prophet made a statement and he's saying you know he was talking to a doctor and he asked the doctor he said doc I can't I won't understand this he says as long as I eat right I drink right I put the right things in my body that it will produce more cells for me to live and the doctors like yes sir that's right he says well how come I'm constantly dying every day and see that is the attribute of death but the power of the cross hallelujah the power of Jesus Christ is life it changed that forever hallelujah once he died haruya even though your natural body may be dying your spirit man will live how your soul will live forever under the redemption of his name hallelujah but you know when you look at that particular statement of you know we all try to eat healthy within that day when everybody's on a diet amen whether it's on a keto or lead or whatever South Beach or North Beach whatever it is everybody's on some kind of diet trying to preserve their life but earlier under those circumstances the only thing you'll get is death because there's no promise of this flesh living Hurley we have the promise when God's saying the day you eat of is the day you shall surely die but when we look and we see what God did through his brother oh yeah church he came and he gave his life haruya that we would never have to die again man can't oh yeah under the compassion of Jesus Christ as my personal Savior you never ha you have to remain halia in a place of death again oh yeah but let me say like this you meet us our dying holier makes way for us to live huh cuz Powell said I die daily ain't man but the reason he died daily because he can only give God his best if he died first hallelujah so death is very important to the believer so we must hurry get rid of our own thoughts out almost everything in dr. I will hallelujah and become a sacrifice to the will and presence of God and the Bible also says how beautiful is the death of the Saints hallelujah so death is beautiful in God's eyes in charge if we look at natural things again you take a seed holy you don't even know what's in that ceiling to the dies you don't know an apple honey you can Apple seeking bring forth apples until that she dies hurry and goes through a resurrection and Greece full of life so it takes a death earlier to bring forth the strength of the seed in that life honey so church it'll take a death in you and I to bring forth the strength of the seed inside of us and the strength of the seed inside of us is the revelation of Jesus Christ perlier crucified and risen again so turns we must hurry you be identified with the death of Christ he said so if you suffer with me you reign with me so we must enter to a place where we forget about self earlier but you know what we would I begin to think about this thought in the scripture Paul said I am crucified a crucifixion is just not a regular kind of death honey please sir it's an agony it's a pain honey it's not just an ordinary way to die huh you're dying in a way that holier it causes her all of your body and hurting different members of your flesh and things to agonizing pain pause went through that kind of crucifixion a man he was he was a whip more than five times we knew his story and night and day as he bit my Vipers throat over the wall all kind of these things that's my Paul could say I am crucified with Christ honey but did not like he says nevertheless hallelujah now you explain the phonics or all other than the right salt behind that how do I live in death like he said it's not i but it's Christ that liveth in me Amen hallelujah he says but Christ liveth in me that the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God so when you die you live but you live by the faith of Jesus Christ what a powerful statement who loved me and gave himself for me so it's imperative that we die to our own self-will because the only way we're gonna bring forth life is if we die hurry to our flesh to our own holier I own our human minds how human ways that's the only way you will be for Christ cuz we must get it right they crucified Him hurry not because of the work she did they crucified Him because they said he'll being a man earlier made himself God see they couldn't died to their own sinking honey they had it completely wrong he wasn't hurry a man called himself God he was God calling himself a man she's naked and died to their own sauce their own reasoning to see that God the prophet of God said what made god so great that he could leave his greatness and become Lohani and take on fresh and be crucified look at a church he was crucified by his own creation so to live as Christ but the dice game what did he gain at his death hallelujah the Bible says earlier when he died and he rose again the whole heavens and earth haruya amen they identified with that death everybody knew from that point that he was Lord and King oh yeah and his only by a guest of self will that you will be identified with Christ because with that a self holy your crucifixion you just live your own life come on but the Bible says earlier the Bible says in Philippians he said for me to live is Christ and to die is gain honey how do you gain by dying well let's look at look at Christ when he died and what did he gain he gains the respect of the whole world by his death heard those that would believe in him oh yeah there is a tree that is called a large pole pine tree and this particular tree is like any other tree you know in order for this tree to bring forth life it has to be put in a very very very very very bad situation most trees it just takes some water and some sunlight and it grows and then then you know fruit drop off and all these things and it brings forth the only way this tree brings forth life is in a forest fire hallo hey hey not just an ordinary fire but a fire that comes down and it burns up everything in his path huh so as this tree is dying hurry is opening up to drop seed in the midst of all of that destruction oh yeah so it takes a crucifixion of death of that tree to brief of life oh yeah so sometimes God put us in situations why so we can breathe for life hallelujah you know I was thinking today how do you what identifies us holy is how we respond we meet corruption that will identify what's inside your seed will you meet corruption because remember unless the seed dies you never see what kind of life inside of it and unless you meet corruption we all know who you are so God allows troubles allow tribulation all these things hallelujah so that you have to die to your own will and ask God for him oh yeah look Church how did we know David was a man after God's own heart it's bad the trials he went it's by the mistakes he made because every time David met corruption always saw us God hurry you take receiver after that Souls 51 God you take a human soul soul was trying to kill him and just like Christ he's always trying to kill him what do we see from David God huh even when Saul was put in David's hands David still wouldn't hurt him what did we see God in the only way David could do that is he became jealous hallelujah if he was able to live a life earlier of gas before life David doing that hallelujah the people saw what a true king is not only just a true King but they saw a man after God's very own heart so it was David meeting the corruption of soul and the corruption of Shiva and all these things Uriah hallelujah that brought out the character of God who yeah it took a strenuous fire a strenuous situation huh to bring out the elements of the life inside that she and God puts us in strenuous situations and steals child in tribulations why to bring out that real life inside you'll see hallelujah go away it took a painting in a car earlier to break out the meekness and Moses whose hey honey yeah before he met her painted in car he was a murderer he got angry and he put things in his own hands he couldn't die but once he learned how to die life came for her Lorraine God would come and step in her Leah and he tells him say hey I speak to prophets with dreams and yes and I believe the Bible said it was never a man as meek as Moses but you think church oh we greens like greens I get you how many like cauliflower spinach mushrooms I got some more you're shaking here but you know you think about that eating okra and all these things that are supposed to be good for you you know those things have to die so you can live so let me ask you something if it dies oh yeah if it dies how does it still has nourishment in it so that you can leave okay I thought I thought we'd have to experience strength from something that's living but the way the body is created we draw strength off of things that die the spirit dies this is the chicken - the cow dies all these things die and our fresh holier feasel in church that's just a shadow of what was really going to happen if you're fresh lives of dance substance to stay alive your so does the same thing you're so holy eats of the blood of the Lamb oh yeah I mean the bread of the Lamb huh he's not the bread of the lamrim him he says I am that bread that came from him drink of this water he was first no more holy see we're really supposed to be eating off of Christ and we ate off of him we ate off of his substance we live and we eat that by revelation huh we're not eating on his is his little body we're eating off of his revelation knowing who he is Hebrews the third chapter verse 1 the Bible says you know before I go there I want to read you something in the in the lives of that same thought and I don't plan on being alone y'all know I'm about to close but you know let me read this team listen what the Prophet God says he says it makes a difference listeners it makes a difference when you come sincerely to God look you have to die for you only live by their substance something has to die so you can live so you can eight to Christ died so we could ante he would have never died holy we wouldn't be hugging for the revelation of who he is he had to die and go away and when he died him in a way that made us hungry for more Koecher CH as long as he was around the disciples didn't know what they had in their presence remember they said they said uh-uh why don't show the sciples wash their hands he said for what the righteousness is here why don't they fans who they're gonna be fastened to I'm here you know so everything that they would have done it would have kind of been in vain because God was right there they had no need to die to themselves so God had to leave and go away huh why so mankind could hunger for his presence haruya so by him dying it causes something to awaken inside of us that wants to live and feed on him what have we been doing all of these years we've been feeding on the body of Christ we've been feeling of the revelation hallelujah of Jesus Christ and you know what you know you eat some things in the natural and you get full right question how many of us have ever gotten completely full off of Jesus Christ [Music] you can't cuz there's no satisfaction in the flesh for Christ honey the only way you'd be completely full is when you're in his presence earlier and I'm not talking about for church I'm talking about the little corporal body of Jesus Christ that's the only way your hunger will leave her because you hunger have to cease that are not in your presence but let me show you how great your hyung is you can only hunger after something that you've had before so if you have a hunger or craving for the bread of the Lamb hallelujah or that water will you never thirst again maybe because you've had a taste maybe because you've had a sip okay like I say all the time I like chocolate cake and the only way I could crave it is because I've had it before so why are we hunger in for him because that's where we come from why are we hunger Holly I'm just gonna get into it I don't want to be too long why don't we hunger huh for the manifestation of the atonement listen the Bible Hebrews 3 and 1 the Bible says Hebrews 3 chapter 1 he says wherefore holy brethren partakers of the heavenly calling consider the Apostle and high priest of our profession Christ Jesus now we know that a prophet of God says profession and confession is the same thing honey but he is the high priest what does he do this high priest he's making intercession oh yeah he knows exactly what we're craving for so he makes a way that your desires can be met your holy cravings can be met why because he's the high priest nothing gets past him listen he says and freest not sign a car but something died that you could live furthermore Jesus Christ God's Son and became holy and because he lives you live also now I'm going to turn the service to the past see is because Christ died we live you know we sing that song because he I can fade tomorrow you know why you can face tomorrow because of what his death meant his death took away every agony of pain that would bother you huh that would hinder you from living this life that he wants you to live but when we look at the atonement honey when we look at what Jesus did for us you have to go cuddly and you have to turn to Isaiah 53 honey you have to turn the Isaiah 53 and you have to take it up from there thinking about this subject you know it brought me to the redemptive names of Jehovah you know what how God is revealed in all the names of Jaffa but you have to see how those names apply to your life the church if we I don't know if I said this before but we don't see it again if we are Abraham's seed we have to see the great God Jehovah that revealed himself to Abraham but what we see we think oh he was just revealed as to provide oh no oh no he was every redemptive name to Abraham huh let's just say he wants to provide he said Lord the Lord shall provide himself but did he stop days and know he was over Rafa he was the hill he was say ball he wants to protect the honey he was nice he he was the para holy and on and on and on he was Shama he was they have a present all of these names of Jehovah was reveled in the journey of Abraham huh but Abraham had to die to his own ways and as he died to his own ways God reveals more of himself if I can just listen if we take the redemptive names of Jehovah and you say well God was he was just a provider you're missing it because the prophet of God said they asked him is healing a part of the atonement if you say yes that means that everything else is over is is the part of the atonement and what is the atonement honey the death burial resurrection of Jesus Christ his blood atoning for our sins so if God is a provider he has to be healed because that makes up who he is listen he's over jiraiya provider he's over Niecy our banner church he's alone Luke church he gave Abraham a pace that surpasses all understanding even though his body was dead Holly was stricken with O age God gave him a peace that one day he'd have a child he didn't worry he didn't go said oh how this gonna happen Church he had such a piece of Jehovah Salome the Bible said he didn't get weak in faith he got strong in faith Roth I was reveal Salone was revealed amen this canoe hurry up in Abraham the Lord is your righteousness you say where was he revealed in Abraham remember there was somebody with Abraham called locked and the Bible says the sins of Sodom facts like righteous soul who you read the scriptures what made not righteous it wasn't his actions it was the prayers of Abraham because God says he's gonna destroy us all and Abraham comes and he starts to bleed he starts to plead for lighting so you're gonna destroy the righteous with the wicked he goes down you notice God came all the way down because he couldn't find no righteous so where was the righteous holding back the fire it was in Abraham he was over oh yeah Shama you ever present huh he was everywhere remember when the king took Sarah huh who was it they got Sarah back it was go see over Shama Wow Church and if we are Abraham's seed the redemptive names of Jehovah walk with us he's peace he's a badass he's a protector he's a healer he's a provider Hey Oh you know and one of my favorites is Jehovah say both the Lord is our protector remember Abraham would to go fight three kings with armies with me and well trained soldiers and finals Abraham went with surface Abraham where they probably had rates and holes and all kind of stuff and they would identify tongue fight three kings with 318 service how could he do that because he homo save up was revealed in Abraham well God is our protector even when there's three kings that want to destroy God comes it says I am your exceeding and great reward does anybody know him as a protector see Oliver Sabel was with you tonight as you came to church because the devil wanted to save us that's weak but God says I have prayed for thee he's your protector oh yeah church when we die we live in Christ we live in the revelation of Jehovah God who lives with his family I know y'all can't even say that you know it's what I like you know what I like you know it's what I like I like it all because all of it reveals who he is but part of that that's what I'm gonna talk about his G / rah rah nah-ah not to scare you honey but - rah like what is he Jehovah is our Shepherd he's our leader hallelujah he keeps the Wolves back oh yeah he keeps you from harm he's over round who you trust he guys and lead us into the paths of righteousness why because he's our shot I love the story the Prophet told oh the shepherd who has disobedient sheep he broke the sheep's leg so he could care for it and that she would fall in love with him and that sheep from that point would follow him anywhere why because in him break the shepherd breaking his leg there were other names of Jehovah also revealed in that struggle he then became a protector by the broken leg because the shepherd the sheep couldn't fend for itself he also became Holly - who were some honey why could the simple was always present he also became Jehovah Rapha why because the sever was Dara make sure he got healed honey to look at your life and see if God is with you somebody say J over B God who dwells with his family God is a family man he's not a baby daddy he's a father he doesn't have uncircumcised shade but we have C that can only bring forth life this kind of life you look at God being revealed in the names of Jehovah I begin to think about life after death and how God's death meant life to us the furthermore we should just what I want everybody to do from now on is what I'm practicing on myself I'm just giving up I'm not quitting I'm just giving up quitting and giving up is two different things quitting is walking away from something Halla giving up is surrender oh what a pleasant thing is you know you stronger struggle against something and then you surrender and everything falls in place [Music] that's what God wants from us he wants us to die and surrender coz your surrender allows God to take over your life in the only way you can get there is if you first before I close we look at the seed of God meeting corruption and how each person each see of God when they met corruption they brought forth life she met death not once but three times definitely father though getting a brother-in-law and death in her own husband and what did those deaths do those deaths led her to a surrender a surrender of her own self-will so she died to her own wants and desires to follow Naomi and by her dying to herself she meant life in a kiss me redeemer [Applause] once you say you know what I'm sick of this I'm gonna get married again I don't know I'm tired of being lonely you know I need a man in my life and no doubt she probably had those kind of talks but she died thinking and she allows herself to be led by revelation you say she be led by Naomi no she's been laid by Naomi's revelation because they you mean that it would take a near kinsman to redeem not only just Ruth but her also so we before she got there who say you know what yo God is my god they she said I'm dead well you died well you launched our launch yo people is my people you know she was saying my mind according to this situation is gone lose your mind lose your thoughts hug and let the mind of Christ lead you you know something I was just saying to some friends of mine yesterday you know charge when we go through situations that seem to be fuss in that moment if for scripture comes that's not the devil in your trials and tribulations the devil will never give you a word normally a word comes because it's that word that will set you free in that situation I give you a prime example I think I've told you testimony before I was traveling you know I was going on the road father please no no I need to work with y'all work you come stay with jobs about a month but anyway I'm going on the road have you stopped yeah I have so much so much need and so much like at the same time I'm feeling st. Lords you know I gotta pay this be like pities me I need as I need that script and he scripture says give and it shall be given to you now I want you to wait a situation wait a situation I don't get nervous on by the clothes but let's weigh it out I'm praying to God I was thinking conversing with God in my sauce I'm saying Lord I got neither got me I got need and God comes with a word that says I know you got knee but gills now if you ain't dead to your own self you say why would I give when I'm in need that don't make sense if I need a hundred dollars why am I gonna give a hundred dollars it don't make sense but God's Word always has a two-fold mean you just got to be able to die to your own reasonings to operate in that truth huh now that scripture hurry up holy that scripture accepted on good ground what's my freedom you know Church what I did I said okay Lord that scripture come to me plenty of time but in this moment you ever been in church and you caught something and see I'm one of them people I don't like to get you sitting down some of y'all professionals y'all can catch you sit now me I'll I can appreciate God I caught it you know when a baseball player catch a homerun he don't just catch it like this he it take everything you know it is sometimes it's like a struggle because it's it's rewarding to catch that before I go over the wall sometimes you got to go up high you got to catch the ball when it's elevating that one's coming down so sometimes you gotta catch your blessings when the elevator we always want God to come down where we get weary in turns just chillin you know sometimes a preacher be preaching and some of y'all expressions like that's all you got come on brother we didn't heard that before give me something else give me on the feet it ain't my job to get you on your feet oh yeah that's your job okay cuz I am a tool for your use huh you have the power to make me say what you want to hear but anyway you know I was like ah to you so I went back home I got back home I was thinking mama can always use a couple of dollars we know daddy dad I survived daddy all right but sometimes mama need a little handful of purpose you know so I went I went back got home with my mama house you know dad was in there cooking breakfast you know you know sometimes we put on false humility similars don't do that they can accept a blessing for a blessing you know what we do I'm all right I appreciate you though I'm all right you've been praying about the blessing that God is using somebody to bless you and you like I'm waiting on the Lord no problem the proper God say it's not hard for us to believe supernatural things it's hard for us to believe God can use our system brother but anyway you know I come in you know I couldn't leave him my blessing so I took some woman out you know that seem like I'm being crazy cuz I got a need but you know what I can't I can't keep him you say what's this for just take all right I appreciate you put it on in this pocket I got the rule so I took the breath back knock on my mom hey my say-so just kind of laying in the bed I got the breakfast and I got the money I was a good feeling that day so I go in and I give her like you're the fool and I give her $100 and she just raised hands and she just started worshipping God she started giving God praise me I'm your son you gonna say thank you son but she went into a worship holiday she started to give God praise so much she started give God so much praise I kind of got uncomfortable being in it so I I waited for a little bit too seriously thank you son but it seemed like I wasn't coming you know I believe still ain't getting that walk out the door sit in my car I get in the car and I start right and God started talking to me and God I said see in that moment you reason why you didn't get any things because that wasn't you as her son she said in that moment you was Joe Vijaya Church we are his attributes oh yeah so God uses you haruya in your flesh to provide is not you as God it's the guy they're praying to honey so in those moments your Joubert IRA if you lay hands on somebody and pray for it's over i-5 they get healed we eyes attributes and to make a long story short earlier I just had to be obedient dancing myself to that song and give her I went out and preached earlier $100 is a tenth of what and I was preaching a sister walk up to me gave me two checks it to guess how much oh and sometimes God got things for you if you could get out your own way if you can die to the way you think it ought to operate and just let God do it he'll do it it'll be so powerful because in that moment it was me a preacher blessing my mom earlier but when it came back around it was a preacher's mom blessing me we are his attributes jehovah is revealed in his family death brings forth life such as we could just let musicians come on close I feel like closing let me close fifty three before I close we look and see what all was revealed in the atonement a scripture if we just take some of you can go back and read it but if we just start at verse three saying he is despised and rejected of me church because oh yeah look at the atonement and this is the atonement Isaiah 53 he was despised and rejected of man because he was despised and rejected we don't have to feel that way everything he went through was because he didn't want us to have to go through that alone so if you feel despised and rejected you're feeling their own feelings those are perverted selves because those thoughts have been covered by the blood this he says a man of sorrow who you touch God has already felt the sorrows and pains of the flesh you shouldn't be feeling that he atoned for that he covered all of our sorrows died to your own Souls he says acquainted with grief oh how many of us fall in that category we're acquainted with situations that brings full of grief you know the cross took away those kind of feelings when you can follow up under that atonement when you follow up under that atonement you should be acquainted acquainted me to having fellowship how often we fellowship with pain we fellowship with grief we fellowship with sorrow God already did it for us it's been put in the atonement Saint doesn't have a right to make you feel grief agony and pain it's somebody saying it's under the blood [Music] see we look at Isaiah 53 and we think by strikes I'm healed it's much more than that look at all the stuff he atoned for he says that we hid as they were our faces from him he was despised and we esteemed him not so he knows what it's like to be despised you don't see cuz I want you to catch this all of these feelings of agony and pain and these feelings of disruption you don't have to feel them God died so that you could live you ever heard of somebody dying because they're depressed or maybe feeling despised it happens in old couples a lot one one one one one one of the couples one of the husband of the wife is going to be with the Lord but the other one just feels so much grief do they end up passing on we don't have to be acquainted with that death can be a celebration who is there surely listeners surely poor how Greece God took them and carried our sorrows he carried out some that means is not yours God carried our sorrows yet we did esteem him stricken smitten of God and afflicted but he was wounded for our transgressions you say you have been hurt in church I've been hurt by my family I've been hurt but he's been wounded already you don't have to carry all those tied to your own stuff your old South died in the clouds and live there are brother T's I've made a mistake I've hooked on this he was wounded for our transgressions he already felt the hurt of our scenes you don't have to hurt anymore of your mistakes just rip it and get up and walk all the time Oh [Music] everything I'm reading you is in the atonement Oh Laurie again surely our griefs and carried our sorrows yet we esteemed him stricken smitten of God and afflicted God has been afflicted for us you don't have to hurry this time of year say oh I'm expecting to get the flu now he's already been afflicted you don't have to carry sickness and disease but he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquities Omaha people may accuse you they may say things about you but God has our Aryan rules he's already been bruised for your iniquities for my iniquities hiring one of the diggity no new riders still to roll already proves for it before you do it God is already died for it this is what the blood of Jesus means it means that you are covered you know I was reading this and I could see why that message means so much to brother Jason because when you call the cavalry and you look in the toilet you look at all the little bit he was bruised for our iniquities God was bruised for mean order to do right and I still do wrong I'm not even feeling the pain of it God already felt the chest has been allowed peace you got heavy right the come through a storm to come out of a storm you go through a storm and feel peaceful why because the chastisement of my peace was upon him God with do these things so you and I could have peace so we could have a good night's sleep if you are being tormented in your dreams take the devil back to the scripture you got a right to hell peace peace in your family nice in your marital peace on your job peace in your church mix in your finances peace in your body holy peace in your mind [Music] the style about people's church why is this the last part and with his stripes we are healed [Music] what are we healed from we'll hear from sorrow we'll hear from Chris we'll hear from iniquities will hear from not having peace we'll hear from our bruises we'll hear from transgressors [Music] he took it all that's why the end of that says by His stripes we are healed you don't have to be acquainted with grief because we're hailed you don't have to be Queen it because we're healed you don't have to be bruised because we held die in Christ and then leave his death got for flight huh so children we think about the kind of life we living is it worthy of the toilet because he died for every piece of strength that we will need nobody in this in this room should be feeling weak because God died that that we could say they're strong you didn't say hello say you're not weak you say let the weak say I am strong and although you may be weak your testimony is our stop oh yeah they bring these I need faith for this let the weak say I am strong I've been praying about this let the weak say I am strong they believe there are situations in my house situations situations let the weak say I am strong it's in the atonement he can't take it back this blood is already been poured out in the last verse of that says with his times we are here [Music] there's no God it's colored all of my hurts all of my paints all of my mistakes why would not die to my own desires to live a life worthy of this body [Music] God Almighty principies see you in the troubles ends ha ha ha in the presence [Music] [Applause] of our team

Bart's army [Music] oh yes [Music] you know I would hate that I mean I don't think I could count how many times I've heard Isaiah 53 preach from I've never heard it quite like that and when you look at that you realize jesus paid it all he paid it off there's not anything that you could encounter from the cradle to the grave but he didn't pay for it he's already been despised rejected yeah he's already born griefs and carried sorrows stricken and smitten of God and afflicted wounded for transgressions bruised for iniquity chastised for peace so why can't I have it if he's already paid hallelujah by His stripes I'm already here I Got News for the enemy I'm already I already have peace I don't have to do anything but accept hallelujah why would I carry griefs and sorrows and carry

we offer this prayer we half-brother Samson Shetty and his assembly there in India committed to you in Jesus name Amen praise the name of anybody got a testimony tonight before we go I had put a prayer request in for my friend Linda a little while ago for prayer for her eyes and I spoke with her today and she was able to drive today for the first time in Lourdes and I want to thank the Lord and thanks for all the I just want to return things to the Lord a couple week a couple of Wednesday's ago I was out sick and that was streaming and you know had prayed for me and in just a few hours later we're doing much better I was ended up which what Meredith got home I was kidding around with her summer she's thinking you're feeling better and then the next day I was about 99% so I just want to face the awkward for answered prayer long time gone so a few like it last month I haven't had a chance to give this testimony yet but it was like a month ago we had some family in town and Travis's uncle asked if I could make a chocolate cake and I was like well sure and I was almost done making it when I remembered that since I moved into that house really since the last couple years mostly my oven does not bake anything at all and you think I remember that but I just don't bake much so I completely forgot about it and I was sliding me up the cake into the oven and I just almost burst into tears I was so upset and I was like I can't believe I forgot this but this cake isn't gonna turn out every cake I've made for the last several years is as flat as a pancake and I know it's the oven I just I know it is so I you know the ovens almost 25 years old that there's other problems with it and I was so upset Travis's cousin was there and she was like why don't you just lay hands on it and pray for it and I was like okay okay I'll do that so I waited for everyone to leave because I was I felt like the house was kind of crowded and it got kind of quiet and I just really simply said Lord this might seem silly to other people but this cake is important to me and I worked hard on it I would like it to turn out please just not only fix this cake but fix my whole oven and that was the best cake I've ever made and it has worked perfectly I've baked so much stuff since then it's like every week I'm baking something and then I also have another testimony I'll make it quicker but some of you guys might remember a couple months ago I lost my glasses and Elijah let me step by step to them and I did not learn my lesson I left my glasses outside again came inside same story had a massive headache for days could not find my glasses I was so upset really embarrassed and I was sitting on the couch and I was like Lord you did it for me before you had a toddler lead me to my glasses outside I know you can do that again please help me find them before the words were out of my mouth Travis walked in with my glasses and was like you've been looking for these and I was like yes four days and then he said well maybe you can get up and help me find my wallet cuz I've lost that I guess we're not good at keeping a hold of our stuff but I was like okay sure and I was walking up the stairs just to look around he'd been looking for that all day and I was like well you just help me find my glasses Lord please help us find this wallet reveal to me where this wallet is and as I said that I picked up a blanket and the wallet was underneath the blanket while I was praying we found these things so I don't think those are accidents and I'm so thankful [Applause] so while faith is on the roll if you have any needs call sister Deborah they met God as good as a man remember it wasn't just a pop of praise Lord's been good to be in the house of God tonight any old Meredith assist Meredith go right ahead you go sis so I think about everybody that I've talked who knows this story and it kind of goes with what Deb was talking about if your kitchen is not working it's a really page four thing especially for a woman you can't cook can't do anything we haven't haven't for it had a fridge for a month and a half because our fridge just broke down and threw all we've had to go through the warranty but today I we got a new fridge and we didn't even pay for it thank the Lord I think they're gonna give us a food allowance too because we lost something that's really nice to hear that ice go bang in the freezer now you know nothing nothing's for free even if you get it free somebody paid so it's good to know that God just gives his children thing to make somebody else pay for it maybe we're gonna let you go turn around shake hands with somebody in the house of the Lord tonight for the cadre would be looking forward to December when we get you back again you go for this year's over width god bless you Saints we see the weekend you're dismissed in Jesus name [Music] [Music] he was [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] you
