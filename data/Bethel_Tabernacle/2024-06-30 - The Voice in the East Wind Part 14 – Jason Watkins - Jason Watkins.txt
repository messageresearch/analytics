praise the Lord indeed brother Luther um I want to also remind you that that reminds me talking about the meetings going on up in Tennessee right now um the the meetings in Swansea which we posted some time ago I'll probably repost that again uh tomorrow those meetings will be there in swans starting uh Friday and they run Friday Saturday Sunday I don't know the Ministry schedule yet so I've asked brother Perry to send me that he said he would call me this afternoon so maybe I'll be able to post an update on that tomorrow I'm so looking forward to reconnecting to my good friend brother Arthur mosac he's the pastor in Paris and I preached there in his church and uh wonderful wonderful brother and so I haven't seen him in many many moons and so looking forward to seeing him again amen praise the Lord so that'll be this Friday Saturday and Sunday the weapon will be with us wednes wednes night amen y'all know who that is man brother Diggs praise the lord we don't even call him brother Diggs we call him the weapon amen so he'll be here with us Wednesday night amen all right uh Romans chapter 5 and Noah what did I send back there starting at 12 I think yeah I think so yeah verse 12 we'll catch 12 through 21 oh this is such a beautiful reading here Paul speaking wherefore he's going to explain how you ended up freeing Christ and it is so spectacular that only God could pull it off and because God pulled it off there's no power that can undo it I love that even you can't undo it wherefore as by one man sinner sin entered into the world and death by sin and so death passed upon all men for that all have sinned see we were born in sin we came into the world that way now you didn't volunteer to come that way Paul says in another place the creation was subjected to it it's all about his plan it's his plan it's his word it's his church it's his Heaven it's his eternal life it's all about him amen amen so we're just getting in by his divine grace loved us when we were yet sinners brother said it so beautifully one place I heard recently and he's talking about Jesus being a son the Son of God and he said the son became sin so Sinners could become Sons wow and it thrilled brother brandom I think he said I think it hit him fresh because he kept repeating it he was in he got inspired by every time he would say it he said think of that the Son of God became sin so that Sinners could become Sons amen praise the Lord amen that includes you too sisters don't worry amen you just have to tolerate that that sun wording I mean I have to be the bride okay so so we're good all right all right nevertheless yeah for all right verse 13 for until the law sin was in the world but sin is not imputed when there is is no law nevertheless see so you can't disbelieve what you don't know but nevertheless you're still born in sin so you still must be born again right or you can never go to heaven it's impossible because the only life that can be in heaven is Zoe life God's life eternal life and the all that's his life so he can't accept your life he can only accept his life and that's his life living in you and you have Paul said I died and Christ lives I'm a new creation and that easy is't that so beautiful nevertheless all right so people were still born in sin it is true that sin is not imputed when there's no law but nevertheless death reigned from Adam to Moses even over them that had not sinned after the similitude of Adam's transgressions we weren't there in Eden and did that see who is the figure of him that was to come see but because of what happened in the Garden of Eden now we're born in sin see so Paul this is a real conundrum and Paul is really trying to explain what God did about it it's it's brilliant it's just brilliant but not as the offense so also is the free gift for if through the offense of one this was Adam in the Garden of Eden many be dead were born in sin much more the grace of God and the gift by Grace which is by one man Jesus Christ hath abounded to many so what Adam sold us into Jesus bought us out of amen hallelujah amen see Adam stepped into death I remember brother Homer Brown used to always say this he said the problem was with Adam the first Adam is he stepped into death willingly to save his bride Eve he loved her yeah the problem was he got trapped himself when he did that the beauty of the second Adam is that he also became sin and stepped into death but by his own power raised himself back out again and now he has called us up oh Hallelujah my amen oh it's just beautiful it's it's so almost poetry verse 16 and not as it was by one that sins so is the gift see read it again and not as it was by one that sinned so is the gift for the Judgment was by one to condemn to condemnation see he's saying there it's a perfect contrast the the what happened to us under the first adom and where we are under the second Adam stand in perfect contradistinction one to the other see so that's why he's using that language not as it was by one that sinned so is the gift for the Judgment was by one the condemnation but the free gift is of many offense is under justification Adam did one thing and it sold us into sin Christ literally has not has literally not only undid our sin birth but has forgiven all your sins even the ones you haven't yet committed amen amen see for If by one man's offense death Reign by one much more they which receive abundance of grace and the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one Jesus Christ therefore as by the offense of one judgment Came Upon all men to condemnation even so by the righteousness of one the free gift came upon all men un justification of Life verse 19 for as by one man's Disobedience many were made Sinners so by The Obedience of one shall many be made righteous moreover or in other words if you think that's something listen to this the law entered that the offense might abound so why did God give man his way when he wanted a law cuz that was not God's way you understand that that was an irrational decision Israel made they came out under a prophet and a pillar of fire the presence of the Angel of the Lord among them but they chose a law brother r that wasn't God's choosing that wasn't Moses's choosing see and so so so they they they choose this and so what he's watch what he's saying here but moreover the law entered and God allowed that to prove to them they couldn't keep it yeah amen you cannot convince a man that he needs salvation unless you can first show him he's lost see the the problem is in leoda and you're in our my age is that there's a spirit of delusion on lost people who think they're not lost they say I'm in Rich increas of goods have need of nothing I I'm I'm perfectly fine what they don't realize is they're actually poor and miserable and naked and blind they're blind to the fact that they're poor miserable and naked see so so they don't think they need the word of God they don't think they need a prophet to restore they don't think they need the Holy Ghost they easily dismiss that as to an age gone by see and that's not going to end well for right so that's why we preach that's why we live it amen you good you good I know I still got you standing it's all good verse 20 moreover the law entered that the offense might abound but where sin abounded Grace did much more abound thank you Lorden that as Sin hath reigned unto death even so might grace Reign through righteousness under eternal life by Jesus Christ Our Lord that's never been in question the the question comes how do I get his righteousness that's the question let's pray father we thank you for your word today I thank you for your anointing on the word that we feel we ask your presence to be here Lord and bring forth this word as you have given it to us Lord so much has become even to me Lord even after all these years of study to go over it now Lord it just almost seems to be coming fresh in a away and I I see angles and questions are have been answered in my own heart things I've pondered at for years Lord and so I'm committing it now to you I pray you'll bless it in jesus' name amen God bless you you can be seated now I have a number of statements today and a number of scriptures um that we going to use a number of quotes from brother brandom I decided not to put them on the display because we're going to have so many Noah you're going to get a workout today so we're we're going to just be ready don't do it yet but be ready for Luke 13 all right and then I'll I'll try to give you heads up as we go so I knew I would you know so having kept you standing like that for the reading we're already kind ofe preaching reading at the same time and then uh we've got a number of scriptures we want to read and I want to I want to read some quotes to you but I didn't want to display them because I want sometimes I can be more poignant with the quote if I can just take my time and you just listen to me say it all right you good but we have them in case you uh need to see them no worries my I want to start today with explaining a principle and I'm I'm going to just go ahead because I like to sometimes let you know a little bit of on the back end so that you know where we're going so I so that because a lot of times in when you're really doing some close preacher te teaching preaching um people can hear all of this data and they don't really know okay how does it connect where's it going where what's this about and you get lost in the shule by the time I get to the point you've already forgot all of that so so we're going to try to focus in and I'm going to read it for you here in a little bit but it's familiar to you where brother brandham talks about how that the Bride of the last day she's ordained to stand she won't fall cuz she's predestinated she's ordained to not fall he says that see she and a lot of times we say he said she's predestinated not to fall now it's important that you understand he said she's ordained not to fall she's pred she's ordained to stand but she's pred she won't fall cuz she's predestinated so there's two or three things that you have to look at layer by layer to get the full context of what he's saying and to get the beauty out of it fully is that okay you good you're going to be good so I want you to think about from The Book of Revelation a lot is said and a lot of P pits preach on it uh the beauty in the message is I can promise you you're guaranteed nearly guaranteed to hear things you're not going to hear in the average Sunday morning pull pit um so we like to try to really be very clear and explain ourselves as we go brother Jason that was an amazing Sunday school by the way so so we find that that when you look in the Book of Revelation you have the the the the woman that sat on Seven Hills and she was called uh the Harlot the great Harlot or she was a those are CTIC words that grade on us a little bit we don't like that language but that's Bible language and she had daughters which were harlots okay so now I'm not trying to teach on that today I want to I want to get you to understand what made the great Harlot the great Harlot and what made made her daughters harlots so I want to get you to understand what how that happened cuz they didn't start that way amen you understand so so what how did they get there and how do we avoid falling into that same trap all right so watch so we find that that every one of those daughters let just make this point to you every one of those daughters ERS began as virgins when they were following in the days of their messenger for instance when Martin Luther came on the scene he caught a seal was partially open a mystery dropped down a messenger Luther caught it and started running with it then Eagles started Gathering to the carcass of the word it wasn't the full word it wasn't everything there were things that Luther didn't understand and he got wrong and doctrines he taught wrong but but we read it right here uh concerning that that you know when when there's no law there's no offense so Luther couldn't be condemned for what he didn't know but yet it would have still it would have still been fatal to his movement and to the church had not Christ been seated in the eternity's interceding for ignorance amen see so so he was not going to pour out his full judgment because he could he did not pour out the full word hence he didn't hence then Luther's age did not have the level of access to the Holy Spirit to be on display that you have now it doesn't mean the Holy Spirit was cut in half or somehow limited you can't take away from an eternal being he was still the Holy Ghost you understand but but the level of display that you can dis play on God's behalf is proportional to the level of revelation of his word make sense these are fundamentals to us so we find out that those that that movement as a movement you had the Virgin bride of Jesus Christ following in that movement the just shall live by faith but then when the messenger goes away and God harvests all of his true bride out of that age amen not one of them are lost not saying those true virgin daughters who followed the message became Harless that's not what I'm saying God actually took his messenger home harvested that crop and moved on to the next age and they and the people that were left denominated it and then it became a seed of discrepancy and then there was no more there was once it moved to Wesley there was no more winking at the ignorance to atone for the mistakes if you stayed back under that Lutheran organization you understand so in order to find Redemption now you had to go where the intercessory was and so now Christ is interceding under the Sixth Church age messenger and there's where life is because life's always in the word does it make sense and so so then that movement became Harlot daughters I hope I'm clear I'm not saying the virgins who followed the word became harlots I'm saying as a movement that became a movement of Harlot daughters spoken of in the Book of Revelation the process carried on that was true that's how it worked in every age then now we're just we're I'm just cutting to the chaste so that we can cut to the restoration of the brid tree which began under Luther I get he was a reformer I get it but it was still part of the restoration of the brid tree it was only the beginning of it all right so then you go into Wesley and the exact same thing repeats a a seal partially opens a mystery drops down a messenger catches it runs with it Eagles gather around the W the word that they understand they still don't have it all and Christ is still winking at because Wesley's preaching a trinitarian doctrine of devils yeah amen amen and so Christ is winking at that because he hasn't revealed it the open door hasn't been set at the end of Philadelphia yet once that happens which of course is going to to come after Wesley's gone or Wesley would have caught that Revelation uh but by the time Aza comes around the end of the 1800s Wesley's long ago passed away and so we find then that that that that God harvested his bride out of there and then what was left denominated it and then that became Harlot daughters and then you couldn't stay in there anymore to find Redemption because Christ was no longer winking at at that error that held right you see so you're believing seeds of discrepancy and when you're holding on to seeds of discrepancy if Christ is in the eternity's winking at it you can still gain Redemption but once he's no longer winking at that age and that level of ignorance you have to move on walk in the light as he's in the light amen make sense so then you come to isua the exact same thing happens it moves forward the open door revelation of Christ they begin to understand baptism in Acts 238 they begin to understand Jesus is in the second or third person he's the person all right and so so there's where Redemption is but they still don't have all all the all the parts they've got another fold of the restoration of the Bride tree but they still got to come back the complete restoration and this is why we say at the very end and for the fourth stage of the bride's restor ation it took a profit because now it's got to be the complete revealing of all the word and there can't be any seeds of discrepancy in it you understand because now Christ is going to step forth from the eternities and he's going to open the book and he will no longer intercede for ignorance you have to repent you have to come to the message of your hour if you want to be redeemed see and so so we I understand that the foolish virgin are safe from destruction but they're not born again and the evidence of that is in Matthew 25 where they're standing at the Judgment bar being judged so so the whole thing comes down to this that there you have to have a restoration of the pure word to bring forth Redemption it can't have any seeds of discrepancy in it because every seed will bring forth of its kind and if you've got a bride in the last day feeding on seeds of discrepancy then how is she going to become the image that unites with Christ and gets a body change how do you think that would work it wouldn't amen it disconnects it's a short circuit see the Capstone has to come down on a bride that's honed by the word of God and and and in her in her flesh life she's not perfect but in her faith she's perfect she has a complete perfect faith in the revealed word of this hour and every promise that it made she believes it she says Amen to it her life follows through with it and then the supernatural can work in her life children who've had the token over them can be brought back with or without their will uh cancers can be dissolved the loss can be saved and come it doesn't matter God gives the power of his word and there's nothing that can stop it amen certainly not your ups and downs and weaknesses in your flesh prise God see so we this is why brother Brandon say would say you have believed the word for your day now we already know it's more than just mental agreement we've taught on that and not preaching on that today when we say Amen to the word we're not merely talking about mental agreement and that would be a boxed in Canyon anyway because there's parts of the word I promise you're not going to understand there's Parts in the word of God that's ministers and I've been studying it since a boy there's Parts I don't understand and puzzle over so it's not about that's why that Baptist doctor Divinity he said brother brandham until we get every last single word and every and brother R says goodness gracious brother back in the early church fathers they were arguing over what a diff thong was it's just a little punctuation mark how you ever going to get all those heads together and agree on every word you you've got to bring forth the word that come under the under the breaking of the seals and that you say well how do I know which one that is God will vindicate it and he has he did and we're Witnesses of it and he didn't just vindicate it in the 60s he's vindicating it in 2024 that's the thing that you from the grip of the enemy and has made you love God the way you do so so they went from Virgin to harlot over time they became Harlot daughters once the Founding Father of the movement was gone it became a completely ill-famed woman now that's what Revelation shows us that's not me making that up that's not brother Brandon making it up so when brother Brandon refers to the bride at the end time time being ordained not to fall because she's predestinated it it does not mean magic powder gets sprinkled on her come on or the angel of the Lord holding a knife to her throat that that's not why she's ordained to not fall amen she's not predestinated because of magic powder or a knife being held to her throat you you get me see so all right Noah give me give me Luke 133 let's go 18 to 21 Jesus speaking here then said he unto what is the kingdom of God likee and where unto shall I resemble it what am I going to show it to be verse 19 it is like a grain of mustard seed which a man took and cast into his garden and it grew and waxed a great tree and the fowls of the air lodged in its branches and the branches of it now later on in the Book of Revelation we're going to find out that that that that that little seed that grew into a tree ended up being the Roman Catholic Church system and the fowls of the air that Lodge in the branches are demon Spirits that's what Revelation Book of Revelation is going to show it's going to connect what Jesus is saying here so you understand that Jesus talks about the kingdoms of this world you remember is it Luke 4 where the enemy took Jesus up and showed him uh all all the kingdoms of this world see and so you know there there's references to that in the scripture where you have the kingdoms of this world but Jesus isn't talking about that now he comes to Matthew 13 and and here we're in Luke 13 but in Matthew 13 he really begins to to to cabbage down to say now the kingdom of heaven so now he's talking about a church and we're we're we're realizing in Matthew 13 this is why Matthew 13 plays out all seven Church ages so spectacularly and they correlate to the Book of Revelation through chapters 2 and three of the church ages and so so he starts so we find out that when that happens I remember when my grandchildren when I was you know coaxing them to uh read the church age book and I remember Uriah just a small guy probably 10 or 11 years old and he's starting to read it and he I remember we're writing one day I maybe i' picked him up from school I don't remember and he's he's reading and he's go and he stops for a minute I can see his mind is thinking and he says so Papa let me get this straight so there were two churches and one was true and one was false in the in the early age I said yeah and he goes and the false one lied and said they were the true one and that the true one was the false one I said exactly he goes I get it and because because that's when you read the book of Revelation you realize he's speaking that there are two Vines growing within the framework of the Christian Church the spirit of Christ the seed of Christ the word of Christ and the Antichrist which are the seeds of discrepancy see and they start out very small remember when it was um not um not baalism bism but uh the whole thing of the Deeds of the nicians that Prophet says you know when that started out it it was just a little saying it you know just started in somebody's mind and he said it sounded reasonable I mean it's reasonable yeah we do need to kind of be a little more organized we need to put everything we believe and it needs to be written down on paper and and we need to have a hierarchical order of things so that we can keep check it sounds sensible but it was the little small mustard seeds of the Roman Catholic Church what it would that would take hundreds of years to become that but by the time it gets to Nia at 3:25 it's completely rejecting the original teaching of the Apostles amen you still with me all right if I see your ears smoking I'll know I have to slow down a little bit so so we realized verse verse verse 20 and again he said wherein to shall I liken the kingdom of God it is like leaven which a woman a woman represents a church in the Bible took and hit three measures of meal father son Holy Ghost ancient Babylonian polytheism and hid it till the and and hid it in three measures of meal till the whole was leavened till finally when you get to to NAA then they they are no longer using acts 238 baptism they're no longer understanding that that Christ is not a second person of the godhead he's the person see so so when this when this happens you you you're going to understand now what brother Brandon brought to us beginning uh you know um you know he talks about the seed of the word Jesus called the word a seed the gospel is a seed and it's good seed see if you plant it in good ground it'll grow uh and and so Jesus talked about sometimes it gets planted and it doesn't it find it goes by the wayside which is the person who hears it it means nothing to them and they come to church for because it's Christmas or Easter or whatever or you know they they got a a friend that brought them to church and it doesn't mean anything to them and he says the and when they get outside then the fs of the air come and the Devils the demons has come and take that seed of the Gospel away from them and they just go on like they were never there see and then but then sometimes it falls on on Stony ground which is not a ground with a bunch of stones in it it's it's ground that is actually Rock Solid Rock and there's a little veneer of grass or Moss with a little bit of soil growing over the top of it you don't know it's rock until you try to plant something in it and you get a sh Trel and you dig one inch and that's as far as you go see and so Jesus said you know that that that kind here's the gospel and oh my goodness greatest thing I ever heard yes I want the freedom people a lot of times want to reprieve from sin they want a little break so they can breathe some clean air for a while kind of get their life right sided again but it but but but he says you know but because it it h it has no depth it can't really put down Roots into the Rock and so when the sunlight of persecution and too many things they have to give up that they didn't no one told them about and they realize what it's going to mean because it didn't put any Roots down that persecution and that hardship of the gospel because they weren't born again and when you're not the gospel seems hard then then they wither see they first they are none with joy but there's a difference in wanting a reprieve and wanting a Deliverance see wanting to be changed so then you go and Jesus talks about the gospel seed Falls among thorns and it grows up it's pretty good ground the problem is that it stays in the it stays in the cares of the world and it tries to live its life in the cares of the world and the sins and the things that go on it won't break its associations it won't give up its social standing it won't it won't make the changes it needs it loves to have that mingling has likes to have one foot in the social acceptance and one foot in the gospel and what ends up happening is this social acceptance chokes the the wheat seed out and it can't never bring forth fruitful Life of Christ and so the the end of that doesn't end well either it gets you with the the branches that don't bring forth are heun off and cast into the fire now I and I'm going to just say some of them are go to their Eternal destruction that way but can I also say today and I'm not preaching on it I'm not going to prove what I'm about to say cuz I'm not preaching on it but but do you realize that sometime and I will just refer you to one scripture to give you something to think about that that that the scripture makes reference at the end time to God's true family yes amen amen but some of some of them build with gold and silver and precious stones and when the fiery atmospheres and trials and Insanity of the end times come they're able to stand see Jesus taught another place they're built on a rock they're not built on sinking sand which is a little broader term because that's what unbelievers do but but now he's talk he's more narrowly focused on people who are good people because some of them build on wood hay and stubble and when the fiery Trials of Leota come and The Temptations are so great and the insanity is so rampid that what ends up happening it burns down everything in their life now un fortunately they themselves are saved but they lose everything they've done and everything they've built and everything they chased and pursued it gets consumed by the fire of the last day all and that's why Jesus said buy of me gold tried in the fire anoint your eyes with isap put on the garments of righteousness that's the only way you'll be able to stand cuz I'm not I'm not only interested in being a a a Son of God I want to be a Victorious Son of God I want my life to count for something I want to know that I put my shoulder to the wheel and that I help push and on the other side I'll raise my hands with the millions and we'll sing the songs of Zion thank you Lord little sidebar you good everybody breathe it's okay we going to car on so so you're learning a concept about the life that's in the seed when you plant a certain seed now I'm going to I'm going to I'm going to correlate the kingdom of heaven and because Jesus is talking about seeds they planted a mustard seed they took meal and put it in three measures and the whole lump got contaminated so we're taught where Jesus was connecting the natural to the spiritual so you're with me so you can understand how we got to where we are so here's a here's the first principle that when you plant seed in the ground that seed will only grow the crop that it was intended to grow according to the life that was in the seed you planted right amen so you can't plant the seeds of an orange tree and hope to grow apples right there's no chance that can happen amen see so so we find that that this is rightly so uh because the word of God was a seed of life and all creation see God how did the world get get seated God spoke and his word was his seed that multiplied it fell into the womb of the earth and it grew it spawned a whole universe you understand so so children come into the world because men pass seed into the womb of a female and that gestates and brings forth a living child and that's why brother brandham said the natural birth is far more mysterious than the than the Virgin birth because the Virgin birth was God overshadowing a virgin God can do anything but how does a human man come together with a human woman and produce another human see and it's they can understand the science they understand the mechanics of that and they can even treat it when things go wrong but they don't understand that secret of life that's what they can't get get their mind around because that's reserved only God can give life see you can't you didn't get your own life and you can't keep your own life you can try to exercise Eat Right improve your quality of life but you can't keep breath in your lungs God has to do that see so so you're really that's why the Bible says let everything that has breath praise the Lord but not your Thief see you're breathing air and you're not praising the Lord with it so M I'm going much slower than I wanted to but I think it's necessary you can see why we're at part 14 so so I I want to make that clear God produced God's seed that produced life was his words amen see and that's what it'll go back to that's why Jesus would talk about you know whose wife whose husband he said you do Heir in the scripture they're neither married nor given in marriage it doesn't come like that certainly not among the redeemed family who are in glorified bodies like his now I don't I don't not answering about everything else that's in the Millennium I've got some thoughts on that we're not preaching on that today as well so I'm just trying to keep you focused on this fact that God's original word created a perfect world God's original word will always create Perfection as long as you don't mess with it as long as you don't tamper with it or hinder it see so so now now you say brother Jason what what are you aiming at I'm trying to get us to understand the value that God sent a message with the original word again because we're trying to get to a body change we're trying to get back to eternal life so he set his Eternal Word it's not a partial word it's not something that could that's going to convert from Virgin to harlot it's it's going to stay virgin and it's going to leave the Earth in a body chain so this is why we say God sent a prophet and you need to get that you need to understand that you need to feed on that because the gospel that come in the message is a seed it's your vitamins to help you grow to be a real Christian see so all right so God said let there be and there was so God's original word created a perfect word all right so so to be certain that we did not miss this fundamentally oh an important principle is an understatement so so so that we don't lose sight of that of what I'm saying here and what I've been saying for the last 25 minutes is that the Lord would have his Prophet to take two exhaustive sermons to preach a message titled the spoken word is the Original Seed because the lessons in that are are are so vital for us to understand this is once you understand that the spoken word is Original Seed you can see why that a Shepherd who loves you would become alarmed if I see you feeding on seeds that might have some truth in it but also be intermingled with seeds of discrepancy say well how do I know it would have discrepancy if it's not the original word it has discrepancy there's only the original pure word or not see so so this is how we've got today north of 33,000 different denominations and interpretations of a single book see so brother bram's challenge to those to those Pentecostals who thought they had the message of restoration they denominated prove they didn't they had a part of it but they didn't follow on to know the Lord as the Bible says we shall know if we follow on to know the Lord so brother Brandon's challenge was that if and this was a simple challenge I love the fact that when you get a hillbilly challenge you're stuck because you're not going to get around it because it's just too simple and shallow to argue against see so hillbilly challenge is one of the most Ironclad challenges you can get all right and there's all kinds of saying that came out of the hills that everybody says them we go man that just makes sense all right so here was brother brenham's hillbilly point that that that that if if one false word in Genesis broke the whole world and collapsed nature humanity and all nature under him all Eve did was believe a message that was 99% correct and one word not even a big word just three letters n o t he quoted to Eve what God Said but he added thou sh not surely die amen and that's all it took and brother Bram just simply said in his logic if one little three-letter word broke it how you going to restore it with anything less than the full perfect you've got to have thus sayith the Lord you can't have 33,000 different ideas trying to fix it and make a Rapture that's never going to work that's going to go into tribulation and the desperation in the tribulation is going to be so great that they're going to pull their resources and join together and come up under the mark of the beast they don't even realize the very system they're in is trapping them amen that's why brother brandham said the denominations will lead you to the mark of the beast yeah it's it's it's inescapable see so it'll lead you there unequivocally so so am so he says how you going to restore it back without returning and believing the pure word because the life is in the seed and every seed brings forth of its kind so when a prophet says she's predestinated not to fall and I'm going to give you one fold and I've got two or three more okay so don't when I give you this one don't just think I'm saying this is all of it okay so when a prophet says she's ordained not to fall that she's predestinated that she won't fall because she's predestinated it's in one sense in one fault of it it's the same thing as if I were to say uh that I will plant a wheat seed and it's ordained to not be corn right amen is that easy so so so now because of the every seed brings forth of its kind so predestination not to fall is a seed destined to grow into its intended crop easy yeah amen see so this is this is how and why that the opening of the seals birthed an infant bride it brought her on the seed be on the scene because it was a word and God spoken word is his seed and his seed brings life and it it birthed a bride see and and and and we're not even necessarily that's why brother Brenham made a a line of demarcation between what happened in the seals and he says not all those years of background because that's a prophet working in in the leoan in the time in the in the age of the church when before they kick Christ out and and he's got his prophet in there trying to pull you know trying to straighten it out as best as he can he he said I'm one born out of season in other words I I I'm kind of late to the party this thing was already underway when I rolled up and so I'm I see it'sot got a lot of problems I'm trying to fix it all and God gave him such signs and wonders that even those people who disagreed with his doct were kind kind of gave him pause like man that gift is amazing maybe we should hear what he's got to say and he would fill up auditoriums in the tens of thousands amen eventually they would reject Christ the seals would be open they'd crucify the word amen and on and on and on not no I don't want to go down that path either so I going to stay stay real real exact here so so we find then that it means that that the bride how did she come on the scene she has been birthed by the full word the original word has been restored to us and there is no discrepancy embedded in it amen so she's predestinated not to fall because the seed will bring forth of its kind oh you're getting it I can tell see so I mean I mean the exact opposite of this would be you know brother brandham teaching as I said Wednesday night that brother brandham shows us when he's teaching in the Book of Revelation that what made the false prophet false was that he taught a false teaching he taught false word and that made him a false prophet so we learned that you can be a real Prophet but you might not be a true Prophet right balam was a real Prophet but you understand so and and and so but he was he was a false real Prophet because he didn't teach uh the exact word of God he taught a hybridized version of of the of of Jehovah so so we find out then that that this is why brother Brandon would show us how how does the false Christ how does the Antichrist system of today convince billions billions of people to go along with him do you know that even the 10 Kings who are like who and I and I again I'm not teaching on that either but 10 dictators so so whether or not we say there it's you know this nation and that Nation whether it's a Muslim Nation whether it's a whatever Nation it is an orthodox Nation I don't you know whether it's a communist Nation I don't know it's just that even the 10 opposing kings in the end Time even they give their allegiance to him amen the whole world World whose name everyone whose name is not written in the Book of Life of the lamb slain before the foundation of the world will worship the Beast how does he get them to do it and brother brandham shows us he preaches them right into it now how grateful are you for a message of the hour he literally preaches billions and billions and billions right into the death trap see see so so the road to Zion or the road to predition all comes from either the seed of the word or a seed of discrepancy by Satan even if it only has one three-letter word error amen all right now so it it's it's it's the return of the full word now that's my first layer of why she's ordained not to fall you got it can move on she's predestinated she won't because she's got the right seed and the right seed will bring forth of its kind see so now let's go to another layer so we realize then that the return of the word and its power it's accompanying power you say how do you know it has accompaning power you you're standing on on the Earth spinning in the universe aren't you so God's word has a lot of power so we find that the return of the full word and its power that is the power of transformation to convert a sinner to a saint amen there's no power that can do that you're born as a sinner doesn't even matter if you have a gene of God you're still born in sin you still have to be born again amen and the only Power that has the enough Supernatural power to reverse your sin birth there has to be a s that you got that natural so there has to be a not natural power a supernatural power that can override that natural power and reverse the order and change your nature see and eventually it'll change your adoms that's right see amen right now it's changed that Third Realm I'm a Third Realm dweller say where is that in the I'm seated in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus there is a direct there a my soul and Christ are in superposition I I'm with him he's with me he's in heaven I'm on Earth but we're both in superposition and whatever he does I do you understand that's that's how that works that's what Einstein proved and and and and and and bores proved is that that when one is acting here it doesn't matter how far away it is when this one moves this one moves and it's not a reaction like bang bang it's bang bang bang bang yeah whatever one does the other one you understand and that and now you say oh we're not here for a science lesson I science only got their understanding from God that's right it's all science I I Jesus was the greatest scientist to ever walk the face of the Earth Solomon was right behind him see so so we understand then that that there's a gene of life now we want to first look at this one so this is from 19 62 the spoken word is Original Seed brother brandom says now Jesus in the word made manifest he and the word is one and the same and that's why it was so made manifest in him so perfectly that's why his life so manifested the word of God he always did that which pleased the father see because he and the father were one that's the reason that God manifested himself so perfectly in Jesus because he was the seed word The Germ word itself The Germ that's inside the seed that's the life in the seed you get it you get it see he was The Germ word of God the germ is the spirit The Germ is the water see now and so now he's going all right so now that's the the gene of life within us a seed Gene of life within us it's the it's a piece of God all right but now watch because now we're going to talk about the pure word the N discrepancy word and Jesus had to be broken open there in order for that seed to let forth its life to water other seed that was coming oh did you see it congregation says even he said other sheep I have not of this fold I have they're going to see that they're going to get the word and stay right with it and I'm sending for for the spirit to water it so now he's going to send forth the Holy Ghost to water the seed to bring it to life amen all right watch all right so so he says they're going to see that they're going to get that word and stay right with it I'm sending forth the spirit to water it and it'll produce just exactly it'll produce Miracles it'll produce the power of God it'll produce and it will not deny anything because it's a kindred seed with the seed Kindred seed with the seed so so the seed in here that I was born with agrees with the seed right here which agrees with the one who spoke it who had the Original Seed this is Brother Ram says this is the holy spirit made into word that's a direct statement this is the Holy Ghost made word and I believe it and I'm and that's why I receive life from it when I believe it it trans it's the power of transformation see it's beautiful so now he comes to 1965 and he's going to give some final thoughts to this idea God's power to transform he says on that seventh morning now we read last time in the Book of Genesis and we went through that creation and we came to the seventh day and God rested from all his work amen you remember that everything that he made that he had made and he said it's all very good right now brother Brandon picks up the narrative right there he says where that seventh morning when God looked upon it all and he said it's good I am pleased with it yeah I'm glad I did it and it's all now under control and I have put my trust in my son and in his wife and they will make them I'll make them head of of all of it that that they will watch over it and see that it's all right that every everything will bring forth of its kind now brother R says now he has the power to do that God then said well if it's all so good and it can't be anything else because it's my own desire it's the way I want it and I have spoke it that way and my words has brought it just exactly the way I wanted it and there it is it's all good so the Bible said God rested the seventh day from from all of his works so this is the very order friends that will take us back to the Millennium aren't we trying to get there see because what what are we trying to get back to that seventh day what broke it God's family disobeyed the word believed a seed of discrepancy and broke it but the second adom comes back to redeem it hallelujah amen see so we're coming back to that seventh day he carries on and everything under control to bring forth of its kind now remember to bring when he put the seed in the Earth the seed can only come forth with the power of life within it to transform it from a seed to a plant or whatever it was his transforming power now God put the seed in there with potentials that it would be what he said it would be as long as it stayed in its right category it would be just exactly what God said it would be amen so when you stay in a Rapture message you gain the Rapture amen see amen so so we find here all right so he says um it had to be that way all right anything that stays in his channel in his line of word it'll have to bring forth exactly like his word said it would do see th this is the advantage in in in do in our domestic lives I mean you know and and this is the advice I give you know when when parents are having trouble with their teenagers or when married couples are having trouble between each other stay in the order of God's word just keep following the order of God's word it will come forth just don't leave that order the the life that's in the word you're believing will force itself and it'll come forward see see so you don't take matters into your own hands all right so so he says it cannot move from there see it will bring forth exactly like his word said it would do it's Channel just exactly right so with everything in in the trust of his own son that it would be that way then God said it's all good so I'll just rest I love this now and each one of those seeds has power in itself to transform itself into the species that I desire it to be that's what it must be because I have given every seed transforming power now think about the gene of God that's in you I have given every seed transforming power it's inside it understand I've given every seed transforming power to make out of itself in its potentials now to make out of itself exactly what I want it to be Hallelujah so so when we realize then that a supernatural birth that comes by the work of the holy ghost in a supernatural baptism that's how the new that's how it comes that's how that dormant seed comes to life you always had it but you walked in the ways of the world you were by very nature the children of Wrath even as others but God rich in Mercy what loved us while we were Sinners chased us down revealed himself to us light struck the seed and life came forth thank you Lord so then you are a new creation in Christ and that places your life on a different path so you say so brother Jason so the Holy Ghost leads me to Zion no no that's not what the Holy Ghost is for you understand the Holy Ghost doesn't lead you to Zion the Holy Ghost leads and guides you to truth see it brings the dormant life in the seed Gene of God to manifested life that's what the Holy Ghost does and when that happens the presence of the Holy Ghost In Your Heart then it leads you here's what leads you it leads you to be a surrendered vessel like Jesus was that you you're surren you're surrender his like he surrendered his will continually to everything in the word of God hallelujah you understand the presence of that that's what the presence of the Holy Ghost In Your Heart does this is this is now this is exactly why now you understand why we don't just Chase emotionalism amen this is exactly why people can actually have a true experience with the Holy Ghost but still not be born again see how you going to make that fit see this is why the Holy Ghost can fall as a true anointing of God upon a false vessel and it will even prophesy and it'll even be accurate prophecy it'll operate signs and wonders and deceive the people and be false you understand so because the rain falls on the just and the unjust the weeds Rejoice right along inside the wheat plant when they're in the field together they are both in the field growing together this is now this explains why brother Brandon would say in leadership his last preached last text sermon in cavina he says the choice of your conduct you can't mix it now you're either for God or against God and the outward Expressions shows exactly what's on the inside see the cucker bur many of you think I got the baptism of the Holy Ghost I'm going to heaven that don't mean one thing that you're going to heaven amen no sir you can have the baptism of the Holy Ghost every hour in your life and still be lost and go to hell the Bible said so that's exactly right so so then and then he goes from there to breaking down see you're a Triune being you're Body Spirit and soul so you can have an experience of the Holy Spirit on your flesh and you can run and shout and sing and dance and run all over the place you can you can have it anoint your spirit and believe every promise and miracles can take place and people can even get healed under your ministry you can actually cast out Devils Judas did that Judas cast out Devils they were they had to obey even judas's scariot see but that he wasn't born again and and so the the disciples the true ones were casting out Devils even before they were born again so the Holy Ghost you what is the Holy Ghost then brother Jason the Holy Ghost is the evidence that God has accepted my repentance as being full and being genuine and I haven't repented partially I haven't kind of repented and I'm sorry for what I did but I'd still kind of like to keep this box over here Lord how about I take out my favorite things put them in here you leave those alone I'll give you everything else you're never going to get a new birth doing that you've got because the Holy Ghost leads you and guides you to all truth and the truth comes upon your life and it lights up a seed and that seed is like chist and then it takes over the body and you begin to surrender your will every day and that seed is going home and that's what takes you in a Rapture that's what brings the sleeping Saints forward and that's what changes your elements because you have an inside perfect faith that believes every word of God see and it's all the work hear me it's all the work of the Holy Ghost amen see it's all the work of the Holy Ghost so even when I say so the Holy Ghost takes me to Zion I only say no because it's not just like he comes in gives you a baptism and then takes you to heaven he comes in lights up a seed the seed takes over you enter the greatest battle ever fought you start living like Jesus and you're growing that life to the top of the pyramid and that's what brings a body change so so we come back to it again it takes the word the full word the whole word and nothing but the word and you got to have a perfect faith in a perfect God to keep a perfect promise and that's where we're headed to friend that's why she's predestinated not to fall that's why she's ordained to not fall see he says in Christ is the mystery I got to close in n in eight and a half minutes you good predestinated Christ is a Myst God revealed predestinated there's the mystery before Christ or anything else was ever on Earth you see his great mystery that he chose the bride knowing Eve would fall from disbelieving the word knowing that she would fall but he would choose a bride that would not fall that would hold to that word regardless of what the rest of the world had to say about it they would hold to that word they are predestinated to stand there adoption of children by Jesus Christ predestinated the church to that great glorious stand so not only will she not fall and not only will she not stand she will not fall and stand gloriously I'm not just looking to stand I want to stand Victorious I want to be part of his glory I want my life to be like Christ to reflect the pattern that Jesus laid down for us that's why we're marching to Zion beautiful Zion Oh friends this is why the word has come to us in this hour this is why you should take it with all your heart and don't take part of it don't leave your life tangled up into the world get free of that kind of stuff let the Holy Ghost bring you up bring you up and out of this world like an eagle soar you into the heavens how many want that friends is that the desire of your heart oh stand with me all over the building I dare not go further we'll be here a while longer but that's the plan of God in the word this is why we say it's so important let me finish out this quote these musicians are coming still got you he says watch Redeemed by Christ the second Adam now Don't Drift on me keep keep focused the second Adam you believe he was you believe Christ was the second Adam yes going back home to Eden with his Fallen wife redeemed back home again that's Christ in the church today taking his wife back see the three-fold mystery now God manifested in Christ C in the Old Testament Christ manifested in the church through the 2,000 years of churches and all together to bring back the original Adam and Eve again man and woman which are one made out of the same blood and same spirit and everything else that this is why he could say the church is the blood of Christ by the spirit amen because the life is in the blood that's the baptism of the Holy Ghost that baptizes us into his body that recognizes only his body his flesh his word see predestinated the church to that great glorious stand amen see he says denominations won't never touch that amen because it's a revelation see so so the first reason that she's predestinated not to fall listen let me just say it like this the the first reason that i' I've spent all my sermon time today and I wanted to get to the second one but we'd be here while I'll get to it we'll have a part 15 but the first reason that she is predestinated not to fall is the exact same reasons denominations can't touch it do you understand let me say it again the very F the reason she's predestinated the very first part of the reason she's predestinated to not all that's the exact same reason denominations can't touch it because it's a revelation of the word why is she predestinated to not fall she's received a revelation of the word and the word has no discrepancies and the seed will bring forth of its kind as long as it's believed see amen so why why will not denominations then make it because they are they good people of course many of them very good people but they don't have the pure seed word they operate on partial truth brother I'm called it a Mongol he called it an ad mixture of Truth and false and those seeds of discrepancy you remember Jesus said the Kingdom of Heaven is like a woman like a church who took leav and put it in three measures of meal leev represents sin and she put that in the in the bread to feed the people so instead of getting the bread of life they got the bread of the church amen and just like that plunges them into a tribulation this takes you in the rapture oh my they don't have the pure seed word they operate on seed discrep and Seed listen friends it bars them it listen how I'm going say this it bars them from receiving the new birth just as receiving the life in the blood and having the token on display of the word in your life bars you from the tribulation amen the very seed of discrepancy they feed on bars them from the New Birth the same way that the Pure Living Word in you bars you from the tribulation Hallelujah no wonder she's ordained to stand there how many want to stand there today say I want my life to be represented that as the word of God in this hour oh my because you passed from Death To Life by the word by the baptism of the Holy Spirit who brought that Jes of God to life and that life has one place it's going back home Hallelujah and since it's inside me it takes me with it Hallelujah and I'm going to get a change of these mortal flesh Oh my he that's you've passed from Death to life you can never come into the Judgment never come into the condemnation as Jesus said amen praise the lord we passed from Death to life amen you love what you going to sing brother Anthony all right let's

say Lord I want to move into good fertile ground I want my life to be something more than it's been and they they won't say oh I love it I think I'll believe it but then stay connected to the world n Lord may it not be so may there be everyone Lord under the sound of my voice today here present across the airwaves by an archive at a later time may they come to know you as Paul said that I may know
