[27:24] her we came up against it even before
[27:26] the meeting started watching the devil
[27:28] already working
[27:29] but then the Lord sent a servant
[27:31] and he yielded himself to the Holy
[27:33] Spirit and he just went right down the
[27:36] exact Channel never knew nothing didn't
[27:38] know anything at all and just called out
[27:40] the spirit that had been plaguing the
[27:42] sister's mind last night about one
[27:44] o'clock in the morning we sat on these
[27:46] chairs just weeping and crying with her
[27:48] she said I'm free I'm free of it today I
[27:51] don't battle it anymore and we just wept
[27:53] with her so I just want to give the Lord
[27:54] a hand clap of praise for that amen

[48:11] take a piece of wood and make a god
[48:16] he said I watched him pack that God
[48:19] around
[48:20] and set it down and worshiped that God
[48:25] Brother David said I thought I'm so glad
[48:28] that I don't worship a God that I made
[48:30] with my hands but I worship The God Who
[48:34] made me with his ass

[50:08] walking on the seashore and there was
[50:10] thousands of starfish had beached
[50:12] herself and he was picking them up and
[50:14] throwing them into the water one by one
[50:16] and this old fella come up and said
[50:18] buddy what are you doing and he said I'm
[50:20] saving these starfishes lives and he
[50:22] picked up one threw it in the water and
[50:24] he said Son looks said there's thousands
[50:26] upon thousands of starfishes you can
[50:29] never make a difference he picked up one
[50:31] and he looked at it and he threw it in
[50:33] the water and he said I made a
[50:34] difference to that one
[50:37] amen
[50:38] amen if we can make a difference for one
[50:42] we've not failed
[50:44] he would have with us we preached Friday
[50:45] night he would have come from glory and
[50:48] went to Calvary for the sake of one Soul
[50:50] that's just how much he loves us
[50:53] Psalms 150 verse 6 the Bible says this
[50:59] everything that hath breath

[51:41] the only kind I can preach but Lord I
[51:43] pray that somehow it would speak to ever
[51:45] Harden to every home Lord that we would
[51:48] leave here dear God with this desire
[51:51] Lord to worship you

[51:55] Our Praise Lord
[51:57] father I pray for those that would maybe

[52:01] comes to an end may they be lifted up
[52:03] and those Lord that would be sick may
[52:05] they be healed

[52:50] Daddy's house until then Lord let us
[52:52] labor we commit this service into your
[52:55] hands For Your Glory for we ask it in
[52:58] Jesus name and the bride says may God
[53:01] bless you who may be seated
[53:07] forgive me for
[53:08] crying a little bit but I've just told
[53:11] the young people I believe God squeezes
[53:13] a man's heart and the juice comes out
[53:15] his eyes
[53:16] I'm just so glad he can still squeeze my
[53:19] heart
[53:20] that everything that hath breath praised
[53:23] the Lord
[53:24] praise ye the Lord
[53:27] the prophet of God says this he says
[53:29] have you ever noticed how the world gets
[53:31] into the spirit of the things that are
[53:33] in the world they go to their ball games
[53:35] and their sporting events and their
[53:37] dances and they interacted to the spirit
[53:39] of it
[53:40] they don't sit there like a wildfire
[53:42] like old dried up sticks but they enter
[53:45] right into the field of things and
[53:46] become a part of things
[53:48] but all how they hate Christians for
[53:52] getting into the spirit of God's word
[53:55] they call us Fanatics Holy Rollers
[53:58] there's nothing that they won't do to
[54:01] show their hatred and their disapproval
[54:05] well brother now what are we going to do
[54:06] about that you know we're living in a
[54:08] time that everybody wants to be
[54:09] politically correct and we you know we
[54:11] don't want to hurt nobody's feelings and
[54:13] so you know if they don't want us to get
[54:15] loud if they don't want us to worship
[54:17] God then then maybe we should just kind
[54:19] of sit quiet because we don't want to
[54:20] offend anybody you think that's what we
[54:23] should do well here's what the prophet
[54:24] said to do
[54:26] he said there's nothing they won't do to
[54:27] show their hatred and disapproval but he
[54:30] said but ignore that
[54:33] you can expect it knowing where it's
[54:35] coming from just go on and get into the
[54:37] spirit of worship our spirit is clean
[54:40] it's fresh it's real it's sober it's
[54:44] serious but nonetheless it's full of the
[54:47] joy of the Lord the Christian ought to
[54:50] be just exuberant and full of his
[54:52] pleasure in the Lord as the world is
[54:54] when it Savers and delights in its
[54:56] Pleasures both Christians and the world
[54:59] are human
[55:03] we're human and both have emotions
[55:07] well brother Daryl I'm just not very an
[55:09] emotional person that's simply not true
[55:12] [Music]
[55:13] and to prove that you hit your little
[55:15] toe
[55:18] on the way to the bathroom about one
[55:20] o'clock in the morning and everybody in
[55:22] the house knows you hit your little toe
[55:25] you will become you know that's the
[55:27] truth you kiss it if you could get it up
[55:29] to your mouth
[55:32] amen we're both human we both made
[55:36] myself laugh we both have emotions
[55:39] but the difference is the Christian's
[55:41] heart oh I love this right here the
[55:43] Christian's heart and emotions are
[55:46] purely on The Lord Of Glory and his love
[55:50] while the world satisfies the flesh
[55:53] while the world satisfies the flesh
[55:55] their emotions is to satisfy the flesh
[55:57] I'm not here to satisfy the flesh I'm
[56:00] here to satisfy the one who created me
[56:02] amen and I'm not talking about you know
[56:05] I'm not talking about the something that
[56:09] would that would work on our emotions
[56:11] something that would glorify the flesh
[56:12] but I'm talking about just loving to
[56:15] love God
[56:17] what's wrong with just loving to love
[56:20] God
[56:21] amen just thank him and love him and
[56:24] rejoice because I want you to know this
[56:26] morning there is no God like our God
[56:30] I said there is no God like our God
[56:35] Hallelujah you know the devil's going to
[56:37] try to tell you now be careful now
[56:39] you're going to get in the flesh and you
[56:42] ain't worried about getting in the flesh
[56:43] I want to get out of it
[56:46] hey man you're going to be a fanatic or
[56:49] or if you praise God before there's one
[56:52] sign of healing there then you're lying
[56:55] because you're still you're still you're
[56:57] you're still sick
[56:59] so if you start testifying of your
[57:01] healing and you still got a symptom
[57:02] you're lying because you're still sick
[57:04] that's what the devil will try to tell
[57:06] you to do what you completely well and
[57:08] then give God praise but that's not what
[57:10] the Bible teaches
[57:12] amen so if you praise God for your
[57:15] healing and you still got a symptom
[57:16] you're lying because you're still really
[57:18] sick but let us be like Joshua
[57:22] look at Joshua where the Prophet said
[57:24] before one rock ever came out of the
[57:26] building of the walls of Jericho Joshua
[57:29] walked around the walls shouting the
[57:31] victory
[57:33] for by faith he saw the victory
[57:37] now when I was in the army
[57:39] they gave me a still pot
[57:42] for combat they gave me combat boots
[57:45] they gave me an M16 rifle with a banana
[57:49] clip that held 18 rounds if I remember
[57:51] right and then they gave me underneath
[57:53] the M16 they gave me an m203 which was a
[57:56] grenade launcher now the reason they
[57:59] done that was because I was on the rifle
[58:01] range and when I was on the rifle ranges
[58:03] shot a couple of times the sergeant said
[58:05] you'll be the 203 man you'll be the
[58:08] grenade launcher you don't have to be
[58:09] accurate just close
[58:13] so the whole time I was in the Army I
[58:16] carried an m203 grenade launcher I was
[58:19] on a 155 Hauser that fired a 105 pound
[58:24] projectile 18 miles on a Max charge of a
[58:27] green bag I know you don't know what
[58:29] that is but that's what I was on
[58:32] so they gave me all this stuff to defend
[58:34] my country
[58:35] but there's one thing the Army never
[58:38] gave me you know what it was the promise
[58:41] of a victory
[58:43] they just said here's the tools fight
[58:46] the best that you can fight
[58:48] but when I got into God's Army
[58:51] he gave me a helmet of salvation Oh
[58:54] Glory to God he saw in my feet with the
[58:57] preparation of the Gospel he gave me the
[58:59] sword of the word and the shield of
[59:01] faith and the breastplate of
[59:02] righteousness but God gave me something
[59:04] else that the United States Army never
[59:07] gave me he gave me the promise of a
[59:09] victory
[59:11] Hallelujah he said you've already won
[59:14] look at the back of the book in your
[59:16] hardest day in your greatest battle
[59:18] remember we have already won listen I
[59:22] may lose a battle now and then but we've
[59:24] already won the war
[59:28] Hallelujah know that the walls are
[59:30] coming down and he earned his men and
[59:32] walked around and around Jericho for
[59:35] seven days full of armor if doing what
[59:37] because he was looking at the Unseen it
[59:40] was a promise that God made how much the
[59:43] prophet said can you walk around that
[59:45] wheelchair how much can you walk around
[59:47] that cancer how much can you walk around
[59:49] that sin shouting the victory
[59:54] Hallelujah
[59:57] shouting the victory that God's give the
[1:00:01] promise when you can see him who he is
[1:00:03] invisible when the pulsation comes into
[1:00:05] your heart and begins to pulsate I'm the
[1:00:07] Lord thy God who heals all thy diseases
[1:00:09] when you can see that everything else
[1:00:13] weakens away
[1:00:15] amen when you see the promise of God's
[1:00:18] word and God's word cannot fail then the
[1:00:21] symptoms don't matter the pain don't
[1:00:24] matter that's not what the Bible said he
[1:00:26] said I'm the Lord thy God who healeth
[1:00:28] all thy diseases amen
[1:00:31] Hallelujah when the pulsation comes into
[1:00:34] your heart and it begins to pulse like
[1:00:36] I'm the Lord thy God who heal us all
[1:00:38] that diseases when you can see that by
[1:00:40] faith everything else weakens away
[1:00:44] I can rejoice in my healing because the
[1:00:47] word says I'm Healed I can rejoice in my
[1:00:50] Deliverance because the word says I've
[1:00:52] delivered
[1:00:55] and God Don't Lie
[1:00:57] God does not lie can I get a witness
[1:01:02] don't wait for signs and wonders well
[1:01:04] I'm waiting till somebody see something
[1:01:06] I'm waiting for a vision don't wait for
[1:01:09] signs and wonders take God at his word
[1:01:13] prophecies will fail come on somebody
[1:01:15] Visions will fail but the word of God
[1:01:18] will never fail to us
[1:01:20] it'll never fail us amen
[1:01:23] oh my don't wait for signs and wonders
[1:01:25] take God at his word and start rejoicing
[1:01:29] saying it's going to happen because God
[1:01:32] said so
[1:01:34] he said I believe if every patient in
[1:01:38] this building right now would accept it
[1:01:40] upon the grounds of God's word
[1:01:43] and believe it and start testifying and
[1:01:47] praising God for your healing the
[1:01:49] meeting would not close with one
[1:01:52] crippled person in here
[1:01:54] not if we have the prayer line come on
[1:01:56] somebody not if somebody discerns our
[1:01:58] hearts but if we'll simply take God at
[1:02:01] his word and begin to praise him and
[1:02:04] thank him for being a Healer our
[1:02:06] deliverer our sustainer Hallelujah
[1:02:12] something will take place and not a
[1:02:14] feeble person will be in the building
[1:02:16] and I say why not us why not this
[1:02:19] morning
[1:02:21] somebody's going to fulfill this quote
[1:02:23] somebody's going to manifest it why not
[1:02:25] us
[1:02:27] right now God is under obligation to
[1:02:32] answer his word
[1:02:36] here several years ago I know you some
[1:02:38] of you probably heard this but it has
[1:02:39] come to my mind I was in Romania
[1:02:42] there's a young Romanian girl was born
[1:02:44] without a hip
[1:02:46] she walked on a crutch
[1:02:48] in which she walked her leg just swung
[1:02:50] because there was nothing there it just
[1:02:51] kind of swung as she'd stop walking
[1:02:53] she'd have to take her her hand and
[1:02:55] stuff her leg for moving
[1:02:58] and brother Kenny Capps was preaching
[1:03:00] the morning services and I had the
[1:03:02] evening it's on a Friday night she come
[1:03:05] to the Altar and she wanted to give her
[1:03:07] heart to the Lord
[1:03:10] and so she tried to work that leg to get
[1:03:14] down on her knees and repeat
[1:03:16] and I thought my God how many people in
[1:03:18] America have two good legs and will
[1:03:22] never Bend to the Lord
[1:03:24] and I told her I said sis you don't have
[1:03:26] to do that right here right now where
[1:03:28] you're standing you can accept Christ
[1:03:31] but she didn't want to do that she
[1:03:33] wanted to get on her knees and repent
[1:03:36] and she worked that leg till she got
[1:03:38] down and repented of her sins
[1:03:41] Saturday morning after the service they
[1:03:43] had a baptism and I watched that girl go
[1:03:45] into the river with the crunch
[1:03:48] to be baptized in the name of Jesus
[1:03:50] Christ
[1:03:51] that night Saturday night she come back
[1:03:54] to the altar
[1:03:55] and she said I want God to heal me
[1:03:58] she said I want to have a husband I want
[1:03:59] to have children
[1:04:01] who would marry me like this
[1:04:03] lovely young girl and I said sis you
[1:04:06] know what I do if I was you I said I
[1:04:08] quit asking God to heal me and I start
[1:04:11] thanking him yeah I said just get up in
[1:04:13] the morning write it on your mirror
[1:04:15] thank God for healing my hip I said
[1:04:17] every time you go to church stand up and
[1:04:19] testify thank God for healing and I said
[1:04:21] you take this handkerchief and when God
[1:04:23] heals you you send it back to me for a
[1:04:25] testimony of what the Lord did for you
[1:04:28] two and a half three years went by I get

[1:04:33] to find you

[1:04:57] said it got to the place that even my
[1:04:58] friends were making fun of me

[1:05:02] and she said I stood up in a meeting
[1:05:04] brother Daryl and I said I want to thank
[1:05:06] God for healing my hip

[1:05:22] out of the building
[1:05:25] Hallelujah doing what thanking God for
[1:05:28] her healing before it ever happened she
[1:05:31] was thanking God for healing her

[1:05:57] the power of the God we serve this water
[1:06:01] her brother I've got a big problem huh
[1:06:03] you got a big God
[1:06:06] um
[1:06:07] amen who are not us friends
[1:06:10] when is the quotes when's the quote you
[1:06:13] know the prophet of God said can I just
[1:06:14] take my time this morning the prophet of
[1:06:16] God said that it will come to pass in
[1:06:18] the last days that men will be more like
[1:06:20] women and women will be more like men
[1:06:22] that ain't a quote that's a reality
[1:06:25] well if that quote has become a reality
[1:06:28] why can't this quote be a reality
[1:06:31] is that not true for his if the prophet
[1:06:34] said that that same Prophet said this
[1:06:36] that if we start praising God and
[1:06:38] thanking him for his healing he said
[1:06:40] there wouldn't be a feeble one among us
[1:06:41] before the service come to an end I say
[1:06:44] yeah Lord let that be Me Lord
[1:06:48] Hallelujah
[1:06:51] God told Paul he's going to Rome and on
[1:06:54] the way to Rome he was Shipwrecked and
[1:06:57] on an island
[1:06:58] and he got bit by a deadly snake
[1:07:03] and the people said he's a dead man
[1:07:05] they didn't even call 9-1-1 they just
[1:07:08] sat down to watch him die
[1:07:12] but Paul had a word of the Lord not an
[1:07:15] emotion not a sensation he simply had a
[1:07:18] promise of God you must go to Rome
[1:07:23] so what did Paul do Paul took the word
[1:07:26] of God over the symptom of a deadly
[1:07:29] snake bite
[1:07:30] because Paul said how can I go to Rome
[1:07:33] and die from a statement
[1:07:36] so what did he do
[1:07:38] he took what God Said over what the
[1:07:41] natives of the island were saying
[1:07:42] because they were saying you're a dead
[1:07:44] man Paul
[1:07:45] they even said this man must have done
[1:07:47] something terrible wrong to escape the
[1:07:49] sea and die by the snake
[1:07:52] he must be a real deceiver he must be
[1:07:54] really evil but when he didn't die you
[1:07:57] know what they said they said this man
[1:07:58] ain't a deceiver he's a god
[1:08:03] and what did Paul do he had the word of
[1:08:05] the Lord over the poison snake
[1:08:09] he had a promise from God concerning
[1:08:11] this promise of that you're going to
[1:08:13] Rome
[1:08:14] so he took the word over the poison of
[1:08:17] the snake he just pitched it over into
[1:08:19] the fire and listen to me young people
[1:08:21] if the Satan at one of his serpents
[1:08:23] tries to latch on to you with lust or
[1:08:26] with deceit or with fear or with
[1:08:27] oppression just do like Paul did just
[1:08:30] bitching over into the fire and keep on
[1:08:32] going
[1:08:33] if he tries to hold you back if he tries
[1:08:35] to tell you you didn't get nothing if he
[1:08:37] tries to bite you just him over
[1:08:39] into the fire and keep on going
[1:08:43] amen
[1:08:45] Hallelujah do you love him this morning
[1:08:49] amen I tell you well brother I'll tell
[1:08:53] you if I was healthy I'd praise God if I
[1:08:57] had no worries I'd praise God if I had
[1:09:00] no money problems I'd praise God well
[1:09:03] that's that's wonderful that might be
[1:09:04] all right but you see the only problem
[1:09:06] of that is
[1:09:08] the Bible doesn't say that
[1:09:10] the Bible says let everything that hath
[1:09:14] breath
[1:09:16] praise ye the Lord
[1:09:19] let the sad man let the happy man let
[1:09:21] the poor man let the rich man let the
[1:09:24] sick man let the Healthy Man let the man
[1:09:26] on the mountain let the man that's in
[1:09:28] the valley let everything that have
[1:09:30] breath praise ye the Lord
[1:09:34] Hallelujah
[1:09:35] will Donald is there any reason I can't
[1:09:37] get whether I'm glad you said that there
[1:09:39] is a reason if you don't want to praise
[1:09:41] the Lord there is one reason in the
[1:09:43] Bible one excuse in the Bible for not
[1:09:46] praising God
[1:09:49] so if you want it this morning I'll give
[1:09:51] it to you some of you don't want to
[1:09:52] praise God you want an excuse not to
[1:09:54] praise him I have one so I'll give it to
[1:09:56] you this morning you can write it down
[1:09:57] put it on the refrigerator
[1:09:59] the Bible says this in Psalms 115 17 the
[1:10:03] dead prays not the Lord
[1:10:06] so if you're dead this morning you're
[1:10:08] excused
[1:10:10] but if you ain't dead
[1:10:12] the Bible God the Bible said let
[1:10:15] everything that hath breath praise ye
[1:10:18] the Lord
[1:10:19] listen to me I've come for one purpose
[1:10:21] this morning I've come not to complain I
[1:10:23] didn't come to find thought I didn't
[1:10:25] come to sleep I didn't come to sit on
[1:10:27] the service
[1:10:28] but I'm like those Majors they said
[1:10:31] we've seen his story in the East and for
[1:10:33] two years they journeyed through the
[1:10:35] desert through swamps through valleys
[1:10:37] through mountains but they come for one
[1:10:39] purpose they said we have come to
[1:10:41] worship him we may have fought all hell
[1:10:44] to get here this morning but you're here
[1:10:46] and while we're here we might as well
[1:10:48] give the devil a black eye we might as
[1:10:51] well let the devil know whose side we're
[1:10:53] on you need to let the devil know when
[1:10:55] you come through that door I'm not on
[1:10:57] your side I'm on God's side this morning
[1:11:03] I've come to praise him I've come to
[1:11:06] worship him I've come to lift him up for
[1:11:09] he said if I be lifted up I will draw
[1:11:11] all men unto myself
[1:11:15] Hallelujah amen do you love him

[1:11:23] just worship Him

[1:11:44] in the Heights praise ye him all his
[1:11:46] angels praise to him all his hosts

[1:13:28] sharpest knife in the drawer okay
[1:13:31] somebody asked me what time do you speak
[1:13:33] a foreign language I said yeah English

[1:22:36] entrance into his let your praise be in
[1:22:40] interest into his presence for the Bible
[1:22:43] said our God inhabits the praise of
[1:22:46] Israel he inhabits the praise of his
[1:22:49] people
[1:22:51] when your back's against the wall and it
[1:22:53] seems like there's no way through and
[1:22:55] Satan has you cut off let me tell you
[1:22:57] something this morning young people
[1:22:58] you've got a gate of praise and you can
[1:23:00] hang that gate of Praise Hallelujah and
[1:23:03] step right through that gate into the
[1:23:04] presence of the God who created you and
[1:23:07] when you begin to give him praise when
[1:23:09] you begin to lift up his name it just
[1:23:11] does something to you
[1:23:16] my daughter
[1:23:18] struck by the train
[1:23:20] 's Daddy and sister was killed in that
[1:23:22] accident brother Jason come to the
[1:23:24] hospital in July prayed for her wishes
[1:23:26] on life support
[1:23:30] and I took my little girl she's only two
[1:23:32] years and nine months something like
[1:23:34] that
[1:23:36] she had a
[1:23:38] she had all kinds of tubes all in her
[1:23:40] body
[1:23:40] feeding tube in her stomach couldn't
[1:23:42] swallow
[1:23:45] it had a chair there in the room and I'd
[1:23:46] take my little girl when she'd come off
[1:23:48] the life support
[1:23:49] the doctors told me if she even lived
[1:23:51] she'd be nothing but a vegetable
[1:23:53] and I'd put her in my arms and I'd sit
[1:23:55] there in that rocking chair and I'd sing
[1:23:58] in moments like this
[1:24:02] I sing out
[1:24:04] a song
[1:24:06] I sing out a love song to Jesus in
[1:24:12] moments like this
[1:24:14] I lift up my eyes
[1:24:17] I lift up my hands to the Lord
[1:24:23] and the Lord raised her up
[1:24:27] and when we came home from the hospital
[1:24:31] she could walk
[1:24:32] she could talk
[1:24:34] she could see
[1:24:36] and we came home with Jesus
[1:24:38] I said it on the couch and I got her up
[1:24:41] in my arms
[1:24:42] you know what I did
[1:24:44] I began to sing in moments like this
[1:24:50] that's right the situation the moments
[1:24:54] doesn't change who he is
[1:24:57] it doesn't change the price that's in
[1:24:59] our hearts
[1:25:00] [Applause]
[1:25:02] because the Bible says no matter what
[1:25:05] happens to us all things work
[1:25:08] to the good
[1:25:09] we may not understand it but sometimes
[1:25:12] they don't ask us to understand he just
[1:25:13] says can you trust me
[1:25:17] I think of Paul is Silas
[1:25:20] it was in prison they were cold they
[1:25:22] were hungry sore beaten bloody chained
[1:25:27] I see Silas you know they beat him
[1:25:29] unconscious just throw them into the
[1:25:31] prison cells Paul and one maybe Silas in
[1:25:33] the other
[1:25:34] Silas begins this third kind of don't
[1:25:37] even know where he's at
[1:25:39] last time you remember is Paul so he
[1:25:41] goes Paul
[1:25:43] hears his name he kind of wakes up he
[1:25:45] said I'm over here Silas
[1:25:48] he said Paula I thought they was going
[1:25:49] to kill us today
[1:25:51] I didn't think there's ever gonna quit
[1:25:52] beating on us
[1:25:56] what are we gonna do Paul what are we
[1:25:58] going to do
[1:26:01] yeah we're cold we're hungry we're in

[1:26:43] you set quiet if you got something to
[1:26:46] say if you think it's good just nod your
[1:26:48] head

[1:27:07] again I'm one of them I'm one of them
[1:27:10] you know there's something about family
[1:27:12] Harmony

[1:34:55] can you imagine the smell
[1:34:57] and only that he was in the bottom of
[1:34:59] the ocean
[1:35:01] but did he quit did he collapse in
[1:35:03] despair
[1:35:05] no
[1:35:07] he began to give God praise
[1:35:10] that's well swallowed you know verse
[1:35:11] said when a fish eats it goes right to
[1:35:13] the bottom of the Fishbowl
[1:35:15] and that fish he saw Joan out there in

[1:35:28] and that was good I wouldn't mind having
[1:35:30] another one of them
[1:35:32] and he goes down to the bottom of the
[1:35:33] ocean he's just sitting there just
[1:35:36] but Jonah is in his Wells Building can
[1:35:38] you imagine the smell
[1:35:40] hubcaps boots and everything else that
[1:35:42] he swallowed
[1:35:44] besides that the acid burning his eyes
[1:35:46] stomach acid

[1:35:50] country when he came out
[1:35:54] but he's down there in the mid in this
[1:35:56] whale's belly in the bottom of the ocean
[1:35:58] and he begins to praise God

[1:36:56] his word and we're not afraid to speak
[1:36:58] it
[1:37:00] foreign
[1:37:02] by the reason of my Affliction unto the
[1:37:04] Lord and he heard me out of the belly of
[1:37:07] Hell cried out and thou hurtest my voice
[1:37:10] the symptoms never silenced his voice

[1:54:40] a service here not not maybe a couple
[1:54:42] years ago I probably put oh my I must
[1:54:45] have put 20 30 quotes up here nothing
[1:54:48] but brother Branham saying now you thank
[1:54:51] him and he'll let you get well now go
[1:54:53] from here thanking him now don't doubt
[1:54:55] just start praising him quote after
[1:54:57] quote after quote after quote where the
[1:55:00] people might not have felt it right then
[1:55:02] but he said you just go from here thank
[1:55:04] him that's a prophet that's what Elijah
[1:55:07] has instructed you that's top secret
[1:55:09] Intel the devil don't want you to know
[1:55:10] but you know it today Hallelujah Oh
[1:55:14] Glory to God
[1:55:15] my I don't know if you've ever heard of
[1:55:17] the of the doctrine it's a false
[1:55:19] teaching called secession
[1:55:21] and John McArthur in different ones and
[1:55:24] they claim that you know there's no more
[1:55:27] working of the Holy Ghost in the church
[1:55:29] all the gifts are done and all there's
[1:55:31] no more Apostles no prophets and no
[1:55:33] gifts and all of that all we have is dry
[1:55:36] formal teaching I just thought you poor
[1:55:39] unfortunate soul
[1:55:41] and then I
[1:55:43] heard a Paul Washer who I admire quite a
[1:55:45] bit more than
[1:55:46] sir
[1:55:47] but but he
[1:55:49] but he's saying you know he said I I'm
[1:55:50] not all I'm not a I'm not a hard uh you
[1:55:54] know on this whole thing of secession
[1:55:56] he's just simply saying I just am saying
[1:55:58] I don't see it anymore in the modern day
[1:56:01] I could never read God's word and say it
[1:56:03] doesn't it's not there he said I just
[1:56:05] don't see it anymore and I thought and
[1:56:08] you've got a global Ministry I'd unseen
[1:56:10] the signs and wonders and God's gifts
[1:56:13] moving in this just in this weekend I
[1:56:16] say come and see oh Hallelujah come and

[1:56:57] Doubt friends you go from here today
[1:57:01] and you make that claim
[1:57:03] I'm telling you I've proven it again and
[1:57:07] again and again and I've had God come
[1:57:10] down and and do things for me and
[1:57:13] healing and different things in a moment
[1:57:17] miraculously no there was even no
[1:57:20] thunder and lightning just the Lord said
[1:57:22] okay it's done and it was done
[1:57:24] that's it's God's not complicated thank
[1:57:27] you thank God that
[1:57:29] that's not complicated my you don't need
[1:57:31] a PhD uh you probably just go further
[1:57:34] away from God with that but I'm glad we
[1:57:36] have a simple gospel with simple faith
[1:57:39] in all it takes is for you to receive it
[1:57:42] I believe that more and more every day I
[1:57:45] live my I I was telling I had a sister
[1:57:49] come up with cataracts and a prayer line
[1:57:51] about about a year and a half ago and I
[1:57:54] just said to her what brother Daryl said
[1:57:56] to that that young lady with the hip I
[1:57:58] said sister just start thanking him
[1:58:00] claim it and go away thanking him
[1:58:02] it's not it's there's no question
[1:58:05] whether it's yours it is yours Jesus
[1:58:07] purchased it it's already done I said
[1:58:10] you just go from here and start thanking
[1:58:12] him don't even pay no attention to the
[1:58:13] symptoms anymore I saw her husband a few
[1:58:16] months ago and he said she would he said
[1:58:17] brother Jason she wanted me to tell you
[1:58:19] those cataracts at this point are half
[1:58:21] gone and they're going and going and
[1:58:23] going I said you tell her keep claiming
[1:58:25] it keep claiming it keep claiming it
[1:58:27] your word has creative power if you if
[1:58:31] brother Brandon said if you let a son or
[1:58:33] daughter of God take the word of God put
[1:58:36] it on their lips and speak it he said
[1:58:39] that is the same as God speaking that's
[1:58:42] deity speaking do you believe that
