[0:00] Um, if you have your Bibles, let's turn
[0:02] to Hebrews 11, the first chapter. You
[0:05] You can stand with me if you'd like.
[0:14] Thank God for his goodness.
[0:17] We're going to talk about faith this
[0:19] morning. And the greatest chapter about
[0:22] faith is Hebrews 11, the faith the faith
[0:24] chapter.
[0:27] We're just going to read the first
[0:28] verse. Many of you can quote it by
[0:30] heart, I'm sure.
[0:33] Now, faith is the substance of things
[0:35] hoped for, the evidence of things not
[0:38] seen. Heavenly Father, we thank you,
[0:40] Lord, for the reading of your word. We
[0:42] thank you, Lord, for allowing us to be
[0:45] here this morning, gathered together,
[0:48] Lord, just to be able to come into the
[0:49] house of God and just to lay down all of
[0:52] our burdens, Lord, all the cares from
[0:54] the past week, the days leading up to
[0:57] this day, Lord. May we just concentrate
[0:59] upon you. May you, Lord, you take our
[1:02] time, Lord. This offering that we have,
[1:04] Lord, there's not much, dear God. But we
[1:07] give all we can, Lord, to thee, Father,
[1:10] this morning. In Jesus name we pray.
[1:12] Amen. You can be seated.
[1:15] You know, the Lord certainly doesn't ask
[1:16] much of us, does he? He just he just
[1:19] wants us to trust him and be faithful.
[1:21] Faithful and true. Now, we want to talk
[1:24] about faith a little bit this morning.
[1:26] And and so it says it's the substance of
[1:29] things hoped for, the evidence of things
[1:32] not seen. Now sometimes you might say,
[1:35] well, what does that even mean? But it
[1:37] is a substance and it's a it's an
[1:39] evidence. And brother Brandham would
[1:42] describe faith many times as when a
[1:44] hungry man receives money, he has
[1:46] received the he's just as happy as if he
[1:49] would get the get the food in his in his
[1:51] stomach. Yeah. Amen.
[1:53] I remember watching a program called
[1:54] Alone and and so the man is is there and
[1:58] and they have to see how long they can
[2:00] survive in the wilderness by themselves.
[2:03] And the person who makes it the longest
[2:05] wins like a half a million dollars,
[2:07] $600,000
[2:08] or something like that. So the whole
[2:10] time he's trying to fish for himself.
[2:11] He's trying to hunt for himself. He's
[2:13] doing everything he can with the
[2:15] anticipation and the hope of maybe he's
[2:17] going to outlast everybody else. And at
[2:20] the end of the when the last person
[2:21] finally taps out or what they call
[2:23] tapping out and he's the last one then
[2:25] they'll come and they'll tell him you're
[2:28] the last one. you've won. And I've
[2:31] watched that program many times and when
[2:34] they tell them that they've won, they've
[2:36] gone through the trial, they've gone
[2:38] through the battle, they're weak,
[2:40] they're many times they've been injured,
[2:41] they're hungry, they're starving,
[2:43] they've lost 40, 50, 60 pounds. But yet,
[2:47] as soon as they tell them you've won,
[2:49] you ought to see the greatest joy that's
[2:51] ever come over them. Amen.
[2:53] Even though they're still weak, they're
[2:55] still hungry, they haven't seen the half
[2:57] a million dollars, but just hearing the
[2:59] good news, you've won. It's the same
[3:01] thing as them having it in in their
[3:03] hand. And that's exactly what faith is.
[3:06] It's God is telling us, you've won. You
[3:09] didn't have to do all this thing. I've
[3:11] done it for you. And so and and and
[3:13] they'll the whole way they're riding the
[3:15] boat back and and it might be days
[3:17] before they get to see their loved one,
[3:19] but they know, hey, I've been out here
[3:20] for 6 months or three months. I can see
[3:22] my wife again. I can see my children
[3:24] again. And they've got that joy and that
[3:26] peace and that happiness knowing from
[3:29] the news that was told them from a film
[3:32] crew.
[3:33] How much more should we this morning be
[3:35] expecting and be thanking God for the
[3:37] news that he's given us? Oh, I've got
[3:39] good news for you this this morning.
[3:42] It's better than a half a million
[3:44] dollars. I can tell you that.
[3:46] Cuz somebody might steal it from you.
[3:48] With inflation, it's probably worth
[3:49] about a half of that now.
[3:51] And and so, you know, but thank God that
[3:54] we've got a promise. Amen.
[3:56] Amen.
[3:56] Now, so faith is a substance. So that's
[3:58] the thing. That's what it's talking
[4:00] about. It's the substance of things
[4:02] hoped for, the evidence of things not
[4:05] seen. even though he didn't see the
[4:06] money yet. He hasn't had one bite of
[4:08] food yet, but he's just as happy. And
[4:10] that's just like you and I. Now, let's
[4:12] go down to the uh verse 6. Hebrews 6 uh
[4:15] I'm sorry, Hebrews 11 uh verse 6. Now,
[4:18] but without faith, it is impossible to
[4:21] please him. For he that cometh to God
[4:24] must believe that he is, and that he is
[4:27] a rewarder of them that diligently seek
[4:30] him. Now, it this is something that's so
[4:34] important. We have to have faith. It
[4:36] it's it's the most important thing you
[4:38] can have. You have to have faith before
[4:40] you can even be saved. You have to have
[4:42] faith to receive the Holy Ghost. You
[4:45] have to have faith to believe the word
[4:46] that's been spoken to you in this day.
[4:49] If it's that important, then we need to
[4:51] see how can we get more faith.
[4:53] How how can I increase my faith, Lord?
[4:56] Now, in Matthew 13, if you want to turn
[4:59] there, you don't have to stand. Matthew
[5:01] 13:58,
[5:06] it's talking about Jesus when he went
[5:09] through and and he was in Nazareth and
[5:12] it was in his hometown and he and he's
[5:14] already had healing revivals and people
[5:16] have known about him, but yet because of
[5:19] their unbelief, the Bible says, "And he
[5:21] did not many mighty works there because
[5:24] of their unbelief." Well, that's not it.
[5:27] But Hebrews, I'm I'm sorry, Matthew
[5:29] 13:58. and he did not many mighty works
[5:32] there because of their unbelief. That's
[5:36] the only thing that can hinder the work
[5:37] of God.
[5:38] Yeah.
[5:39] Is unbelief. So we need to get rid of
[5:42] all the unbelief. Now how do we do that?
[5:44] How do we get rid of the unbelief? Now
[5:47] what we have to do of course we know how
[5:49] do you get faith?
[5:52] Faith comes by hearing
[5:53] and hearing by the word.
[5:56] Now, um, let's go down to I'm going to
[6:01] say slide not slide there. Um,
[6:06] let let's go down to where it says it's
[6:08] um looking at the unseen uh it's uh
[6:11] number 76 there. There it is. I'm told
[6:13] by the aviators who fly there hear real
[6:16] fast jet planes and they say that the
[6:19] plane getting up to a certain speed that
[6:21] it vibrates and it shakes and it seems
[6:24] like that the bolts are going to fly out
[6:25] of it that the wings are going to come
[6:27] off until they pass the sound barrier.
[6:30] But after they once passed that sound
[6:32] barrier they say the plane just sails
[6:35] out just in ease when it passes the
[6:37] sound barrier. That's the obstacle
[6:39] that's in the way of the plane. When it
[6:41] passes its own sound, then it runs at
[6:44] ease.
[6:45] Now, I'm going to read the next one here
[6:47] in just a second. But, Brother Brandham,
[6:49] he typed that as receiving the Holy
[6:51] Ghost. He typed that as getting through
[6:53] the battles of this world. And and so,
[6:55] what is that sound? It's the uncertain
[6:57] sounds that we hear all the time. It's
[6:59] the uncertain it's it's the sound. It's
[7:00] the words of the devil telling you,
[7:02] "Well, you're not worthy." It's the
[7:03] words of the devil saying, "Well, that's
[7:05] for somebody else. That's for brother
[7:06] Adam or that's for brother Caleb. Right?
[7:08] Did I say it right? Josh or Caleb? I
[7:09] can't ever get you right. I think I said
[7:11] it right the first time, didn't I?
[7:14] Or for brother Josiah. Maybe that's for
[7:16] somebody else, but it's not for me. See,
[7:18] and that's the devil talking to you
[7:20] because every promise in the book is
[7:22] whose?
[7:23] Mine. It's my promise. It was given to
[7:26] me. So now when those people come to
[7:28] that guy and said, "You've won a half a
[7:30] million dollars." And on the boat ride
[7:31] back off that island or wherever he's
[7:33] at, somebody's saying, "You're really
[7:34] not going to get it. I don't know what
[7:36] they've told you, but oh no, they've
[7:38] done told me. I've seen the contract. I
[7:40] know it's written. I'm going to get that
[7:41] money. It's as good as mine. Oh, no.
[7:43] Don't ever think that." See, that's just
[7:45] the devil telling you that.
[7:46] He's telling you you're you're not
[7:48] worthy enough. And you're not. None of
[7:50] us are.
[7:51] If you try to get that on your own
[7:53] worthiness, brother, you're a miserable
[7:54] failure just like I am.
[7:56] Like brother Jason was talking about,
[7:57] I'm an unprofitable servant. Well, thank
[7:59] God because God doesn't need my profit.
[8:01] He doesn't need anything that I can do
[8:04] except for believe what he's already
[8:06] done.
[8:07] That's all we have to do. It seems so
[8:09] simple, but yet it's so hard.
[8:11] Because what can hinder faith? Unbelief.
[8:15] Doubt, unbelief, all these things come
[8:17] in so many different manifestations.
[8:19] Yes, sir.
[8:20] One thing is is maybe the way you were
[8:23] raised. Maybe you didn't have a father
[8:25] or maybe you didn't have you couldn't
[8:26] rely on people and just kind of you're
[8:28] an untrusting person. Maybe you had
[8:30] you've had a lot of heartaches and
[8:32] failures in your life. Maybe somebody
[8:33] hurt you. So all these things can play
[8:36] in to why it's so hard sometimes to
[8:38] believe. And and we can't we can't look
[8:41] at politics. You can't look at the
[8:42] politicians. You can't believe the
[8:43] things that they do. And science changes
[8:46] every few years. So you've put all your
[8:48] eggs in that basket. Well, guess what?
[8:49] It's going to get turned over. So the
[8:51] only sure thing in this world is God's
[8:53] word. But that's the very thing the
[8:55] devil tries to get you away from. If he
[8:57] if he can't get you to just outright
[8:58] disbelieve it, which he will, but if he
[9:01] can't get you to do that, then he'll get
[9:03] you so busy that you don't have time to
[9:04] read it. You don't have time to listen
[9:06] to the tapes. You don't have time to
[9:08] study God's word. You don't have time
[9:10] because we're so caught up in just
[9:12] making a living. He'll he'll do
[9:13] everything he can to to to take your
[9:16] time and to take you away from the
[9:18] things you need to be doing. He'll take
[9:20] you away from fellowship. He'll do
[9:21] everything he can to stop you from
[9:23] increasing your faith.
[9:24] That's good.
[9:25] Amen.
[9:25] I read a quote. I may have read it here
[9:27] before, but brother Brandon was in a
[9:28] prayer line and maybe you haven't heard
[9:29] it, maybe you have. And he was praying
[9:31] for a woman and he and he saw it as a
[9:33] black streak and it went from that woman
[9:35] to another woman as demons crying out to
[9:38] one another. I know you've heard him say
[9:39] that many times. And he could see in
[9:41] into the unseen. See, he could see into
[9:43] the realms that you and I have five
[9:45] senses. But he was in tune very keenly
[9:48] with that six sense. He was in tune also
[9:51] with the supernatural realm that he
[9:53] could that he could see. He was like a
[9:55] an eagle. He was carried way up high and
[9:56] he could look a long ways off like a spy
[9:59] in in the military or so. So they say.
[10:02] But anyhow, he saw the demons and he
[10:03] said, "Oh," he said, "Those demons are
[10:05] crying out to one another. They're
[10:07] trying to accumulate unbelief."
[10:10] See, they knew the power of getting
[10:12] together. They knew the power of of
[10:15] coming together and bringing their
[10:17] little licks of darkness together. And
[10:19] they know that if they can accumulate
[10:21] unbelief that the works of God can't be
[10:23] done.
[10:24] For right here in Matthew 13:58 that
[10:27] because of their unbelief, it hindered
[10:29] the very work of the Lord Jesus when he
[10:31] was here on the earth.
[10:32] Amen.
[10:33] And and so if the devil can do the same
[10:35] thing to you and I, how much greater
[10:38] what's greater darkness or or light?
[10:41] The light. What's what's greater? The
[10:43] sin or the savior? What's greater? The
[10:45] sickness or the healer?
[10:47] See, so if we get together, if we take a
[10:52] lesson from what the devils are telling
[10:54] us, that if unbelief can hinder the work
[10:56] of God, HOW MUCH MORE CAN FAITH BRING
[10:59] ABOUT THE PROMISES of God this morning?
[11:02] We've got to get together with one
[11:03] another of like precious faith.
[11:06] Don't never say nothing negative to one
[11:08] another. Always let your testimony be
[11:11] positive. Oh, how many times do we hear
[11:13] brother Brandham talk about that faith?
[11:15] It's your what is it? It's your
[11:17] testimony.
[11:18] It is a victory that the devil will rob
[11:20] you of every time.
[11:22] If he can't get you, he can't disarm
[11:25] you. But like brother Elijah was talking
[11:27] about, if he can get you to discredit
[11:29] the weapon that God has given you,
[11:30] you'll lay it down and never use it. BUT
[11:33] GOD HAS GIVEN us a weapon this morning.
[11:35] He's given us faith. He's given us the
[11:36] Holy Ghost. And he's given us power over
[11:39] every unclean spirit in our life in
[11:41] whatever whatever avenue that we have to
[11:44] face the devil.
[11:46] Amen.
[11:47] Is this a Sunday school lesson or is
[11:48] this a preaching?
[11:51] I'm sorry.
[11:54] But Revelations 218, it says
[11:59] that the fearful and the unbelieving Can
[12:01] you turn there, brother? I don't know if
[12:02] you have that up there or not.
[12:04] Yes. Revelations 218. Let's see if we
[12:07] can go there. That's easy. It's the last
[12:09] book of the Bible. When you get to the
[12:10] maps and the concordance in the
[12:12] dictionary, just keep on going till you
[12:14] get to the next one. 218.
[12:19] When I was a kid, I used to sit there
[12:20] and look at the maps. Supposed to be
[12:22] listening to the preacher, but I'd be
[12:23] looking at the maps in the Bible.
[12:26] I guess I heard a little bit of what was
[12:28] going on.
[12:30] Revelations 2:18, but the fearful, let's
[12:33] let's back up to verse 7. He that
[12:35] overcomemeth shall inherit all things.
[12:38] Okay?
[12:40] And I will be his God, and he shall be
[12:42] my son. But the fearful and unbelieving
[12:47] and the abominable, murderers, and
[12:48] whoreongers, sorcerers, idolattors, and
[12:50] all liars shall have their part in the
[12:52] lake which burneth with fire. Now,
[12:54] there's a difference in this fearful and
[12:57] the fearful that's speaking about in
[12:58] Hebrews
[13:00] 7 11:7. Let's go back there.
[13:04] By faith, Noah being warned of God of
[13:06] things not seen as yet moved with fear.
[13:10] Okay? Now, he had a fear, but his fear
[13:14] was different. See, it was different
[13:15] than the fearful talking about in
[13:17] Revelations, cuz he had a fear, an
[13:20] awesome respect and an awesome reverence
[13:23] and an awesome obedience to God. See,
[13:26] this fear was different. The fear in
[13:28] revelations was the fearful of not
[13:31] taking God at his word, not believing
[13:33] what he had to tell you. Brother
[13:36] Brandham t that is when they went up and
[13:38] they were looking over Canaan. And there
[13:40] were 12 spies that went over and they
[13:43] came back and I heard one old preacher
[13:45] say 12 came back with or 10 came back
[13:47] with the gripes, but only two came back
[13:50] with the grapes.
[13:51] See, all they could see was the was the
[13:54] was the negative of what was there. OH,
[13:56] THERE'S GIANTS. THERE'S WALLED CITIES.
[13:58] WE CAN'T TAKE IT. But Joshua and Caleb,
[14:02] I think there's two of them here this
[14:03] morning WHO SAID, "WE'RE MORE THAN ABLE
[14:06] TO TAKE the land."
[14:08] See,
[14:09] they knew. They had seen the work of
[14:11] God. THEY HAD SEEN WHAT GOD HAD already
[14:13] done in their life. Oh, they were
[14:15] brought out by a miraculous hand out of
[14:17] out of slavery and bondage and led to a
[14:21] land flowing with milk and honey.
[14:23] Hallelujah. Amen.
[14:24] Everywhere the soul of your feet lands
[14:26] is yours. All you got to do is just go
[14:28] and possess it. But they were fearful.
[14:30] No, no, we can't do it. Let's go back.
[14:32] We want to go back to the flesh pots. We
[14:34] want to go back to the leaks and the
[14:35] onions and the go. Oh, and and slavery,
[14:37] too. But but we'll leave that aside. But
[14:39] we want all the No. See, afraid to take
[14:43] God at his word. That's the fearful and
[14:46] the unbelieving
[14:47] are lumped in with the adulterers and
[14:49] the whoreongers and all those. So we
[14:52] must must must have faith this morning.
[14:55] Amen.
[14:56] Silence all voices to the contrary.
[14:58] That's right.
[14:59] Believe his word. Amen.
[15:01] Thank you, Lord.
[15:02] Now, what's the worst thing that can
[15:04] happen if you trust God? Many times,
[15:07] Brother Brandon would go and he pray for
[15:08] people and the and the doctors WOULD
[15:10] SAY, "OH, YOU'RE GIVING THEM A FALSE
[15:11] HOPE." HE SAID, "WELL, I'M GIVING THEM
[15:13] HOPE. YOU'RE GIVING THEM NO HOPE.
[15:16] You're saying there's no hope for you.
[15:17] You're going to die. But I'm giving them
[15:19] a a hope in Christ.
[15:23] Now, uh, scroll up, brother. Go to the
[15:25] PowerPoint and I want to read you what
[15:27] he said. Um,
[15:29] keep going. Well, I tell you what, go
[15:32] back down to that next one there. No,
[15:34] no, the 78 where it says 77. I'm I'm
[15:37] sorry. 76 and 77. [snorts]
[15:41] There it is. Oh, if the church of this
[15:42] day could ever pray till they pass the
[15:45] sin barrier and the unbelief barrier.
[15:48] Now, he's talking about that sound
[15:49] barrier. Oh, I don't want to hear the
[15:51] sound of the devil. I don't want to hear
[15:53] no rock music, no rap music, none of
[15:55] that hip-hop garbage. What I want TO DO
[15:57] IS PASS ALL THESE SOUND BARRIERS and all
[15:59] these uncertain sounds.
[16:01] Listen to that voice this morning. They
[16:04] could shout the victory of a living God
[16:06] once they pass that barrier by looking
[16:09] to the unseen. But we've got to go look.
[16:12] Says right here, the first ch first
[16:15] sentence. Oh, if the church of this day
[16:17] could ever pray till they pass the sin
[16:20] barrier. Oh, the devil, he'll get you to
[16:22] where you don't want to pray as much
[16:23] anymore. What about sweet hour of prayer
[16:26] turned into let's just have a little
[16:27] talk with Jesus, right? Used to be sweet
[16:29] hour prayer. They talked about the
[16:31] allnight prayer meetings, William
[16:33] Seymour and uh Evan Roberts during the
[16:35] Welch revival and William Seymour during
[16:37] the Isuza revival and outpouring of God
[16:40] and the Holy Spirit on the church. But
[16:42] when they once passed that barrier by
[16:43] looking to the unseen and letting the
[16:46] WORLD VIBRATE AND DO WHAT IT WANTS TO
[16:48] DO, DOESN'T MATTER what they're saying
[16:50] out there. Doesn't matter about the
[16:51] saber rattling in Ukraine, in Russia,
[16:53] all the politics. Let it do what it's
[16:55] going to do. Let it do what it wants to
[16:57] do. But there's a living God. And when
[16:59] we lose our disbelief and our unbelief
[17:02] in him and pass that place that the
[17:04] world is saying the days of miracles has
[17:06] passed, it makes you shake. Oh, there's
[17:09] no such thing as a baptism of the Holy
[17:11] Ghost. It makes you wonder going to the
[17:13] next one. But if you'll just look at the
[17:14] unseen to the God who promised it for
[17:17] the promise is unto you and your
[17:20] children.
[17:21] Oh my. It's not just for back in 1965.
[17:24] Oh, they say brother Brandon was the
[17:26] only one that had the Holy Ghost. Oh my.
[17:28] He had the Holy Ghost. But I tell you
[17:29] one thing, you won't find a quote
[17:31] nowhere where he ever said it ceased
[17:33] with the apostles. IT CEASED WHEN I GO
[17:35] off the scene.
[17:38] My goodness. But the promise is unto you
[17:40] and to your children and your children's
[17:43] children.
[17:44] Them that are far off, even as many as
[17:47] the Lord our God shall call. Hallelujah.
[17:50] Now,
[17:52] if you'll look to the blessed word that
[17:54] says Jesus Christ is the same yesterday,
[17:57] today, and forever, turn your heads
[17:58] toward that and press on until you pass
[18:01] that vibration, past the unbelief
[18:03] barriers and the sin barriers and all
[18:05] THE BARRIERS THAT SEEMS to hinder you.
[18:08] You'll fly free in the faith of God,
[18:10] knowing that all things are possible.
[18:13] Then there's no limit. They say hardly
[18:15] to the speed of the plane will go. If
[18:17] there's no limit to the speed the plane
[18:19] will go, there's no limits to the
[18:21] blessings that God will pour down upon a
[18:23] believer that will believe. The
[18:25] scripture claims him to be the same
[18:27] yesterday, today, and forever. Oh my,
[18:30] what a promise. What a blessing TO US.
[18:33] WE'VE JUST GOT TO PUSH PAST THE SIN
[18:35] BARRIER in our life.
[18:38] No matter what it is, when you get up in
[18:40] THE MORNING, DON'T GRAB YOUR phone and
[18:42] look at what so and SO SAID. DON'T TURN
[18:45] ON THE TV OR turn on the music, why
[18:47] don't you just roll over and say JUST
[18:49] BEFORE YOU EVEN GET OUT OF THE BED in
[18:51] the morning, say, "Oh, God, thank you.
[18:53] Thank you for waking me up. Thank you
[18:55] for your blessings. Thank you, God, for
[18:57] saving me. Thank you FOR HEALING ME.
[18:59] THANK YOU FOR GIVING ME THE HOLY GHOST."
[19:01] AMEN. START CONFESSING IT. START SAYING
[19:04] IT. AND GOD WILL BRING IT TO PASS.
[19:07] Thank you, God, for saving my children.
[19:09] Thank you, GOD, FOR SAVING my brother,
[19:11] my lost brother that's out in sin. THANK
[19:13] YOU FOR SAVING MY SISTER. THANK YOU FOR
[19:16] DELIVERING them of alcoholism or drugs
[19:18] OR PORNOGRAPHY OR WHATEVER IT IS THEY'RE
[19:20] CAUGHT UP in in this day. Start thanking
[19:24] him before you even get out of bed in
[19:25] the morning.
[19:26] Say, "Oh, God." And watch the blessings
[19:29] come down. Oh, praises go up, blessings
[19:32] come down. You believe that this
[19:34] morning? Just pray and seek after him.
[19:37] Hallelujah.
[19:39] But what's the worst thing that can
[19:40] happen in trusting God? going up,
[19:42] brother. He's talking about if I prayed
[19:44] for 10,000 people, it's it's before that
[19:47] one.
[19:49] Maybe I can find it on here.
[19:52] But he said this here. He said, "If I
[19:54] prayed for 10,000 people,
[19:58] how could Let's see.
[20:02] Here it is. Let's see.
[20:06] If the whole world doubted, it's one
[20:07] that's got the two the two bullets on it
[20:10] right there. If the whole world doubted
[20:11] it, I would still believe it with all my
[20:13] heart. If I would pray for 10,000 people
[20:16] overseas or here and all 10,000 would
[20:19] die in a moment after I prayed for them,
[20:22] I'd still say divine healing was right.
[20:24] Amen.
[20:25] Amen.
[20:26] It's the word of God. Now listen to
[20:28] this. And if I preached to 10,000 and
[20:31] they all died and they were dead for 20
[20:34] years, listen to this. They were dead
[20:36] for 20 years and returned back and said,
[20:38] "There's no Jesus. There's no such thing
[20:41] as God. There is no eternity." And Jesus
[20:44] wasn't the son of God. And I was dying.
[20:47] I'd say, "Let me go in him. I take my
[20:50] bark." No matter what anyone else would
[20:52] say, I believe him with all my heart.
[20:55] Oh, silence all voices. He said, even if
[20:57] they came back from the dead and told
[21:00] you there was no God, I'm still going to
[21:01] believe him. Doesn't make any
[21:03] difference. If you pray for 10,000
[21:05] people and they all died, I'm still
[21:07] going to say God's a healer.
[21:09] We were invited one time to go to a
[21:11] little church, I'm not going to name the
[21:12] name of the denomination, but they don't
[21:14] believe. Well, I'll just say this part
[21:16] here first. There was a little boy in
[21:18] that church. He had a brain tumor and we
[21:20] got to know them and they like for us to
[21:22] sing and and he said, "I want you to
[21:23] come and sing for my son in the church
[21:26] and I want them to hear you." And he had
[21:28] a huge church. He had to have two
[21:29] services on Sunday morning just to get
[21:31] them all in. He had one at nine, I
[21:33] believe, and one at 10 or 10 or 11. And
[21:35] so we got up and we sung, "He was
[21:38] wounded for our transgressions. He was
[21:41] bruised for our iniquities. Oh my, he's
[21:44] the healer of men. So true." And we sung
[21:46] that and and oh my, we we went sit down
[21:49] and the preacher got up and I'll never
[21:51] forget it. He said, "Don't don't you
[21:53] think for one second that divine healing
[21:56] was under the atonement." I said, "Oh my
[21:58] goodness." And I'm sitting there and I'm
[22:00] listening to what he's saying and I it
[22:03] this comes back to me in Hebrews 11:7.
[22:06] By faith Noah being warned of God of
[22:08] things not yet not seen as yet moved the
[22:10] fear prepared an arc to the saving of
[22:12] his house by the which he condemned the
[22:15] world. Let me tell you something. When
[22:17] you believe God and you take God at what
[22:19] he says your faith will condemn this
[22:22] world one day he'll GOD WILL SAY I HAD
[22:25] SOMEBODY WHO BELIEVED ME. I HAD SOMEBODY
[22:27] WHO TOOK ME AT HIS WORD.
[22:29] Noah took God at his word and it
[22:31] condemned the world. Amen. One day our
[22:34] testimony is going to stand in judgment.
[22:36] One day our TESTIMONY OF FAITH WILL
[22:38] CONDEMN this world
[22:39] WHEN THEY'VE HAD THE SAME OPPORTUNITY TO
[22:42] BELIEVE. I've got five more minutes.
[22:46] Amen.
[22:47] Amen.
[22:48] They'll say you're foolish and they say
[22:51] that divine healing is not in the
[22:53] atonement. Oh my. Well, just let him say
[22:55] it. If the if the whole world doubt it.
[22:58] Now, this is what brother Brandham said
[23:00] here on the one says 93. It's the one
[23:02] down from the audience. Keep yourself
[23:04] shut in. I think he just had prayer. He
[23:06] had them lay their hands on one another.
[23:07] Keep yourself shut in just a few moments
[23:09] with God. I want to ask you now as you
[23:12] move your hands back from one another
[23:14] and say, "I believe and I take him right
[23:16] now as my healer. And no matter what
[23:19] Satan ever tries to tell me, I'm going
[23:22] to believe that God makes me well. No
[23:25] matter what Satan ever, now I'm going to
[23:26] add this. No matter what Satan ever
[23:28] tries to tell me, I believe I'm one of
[23:30] them. No matter what Satan ever tries to
[23:32] tell me, I believe that my sins are
[23:34] under the blood. Oh, let me tell you
[23:36] something, brothers and sisters. They're
[23:37] not just covered. They're not just
[23:38] forgotten about. Brother Brandham said
[23:40] that when that little drop of ink falls
[23:42] in that tub of bleach, it goes back TO
[23:44] THE VERY ELEMENTS WHERE IT COME FROM.
[23:46] EVEN BACK ONTO THE VERY HEAD OF SATAN.
[23:49] IT'S GONE. IT CAN'T EVEN be found
[23:51] anymore.
[23:52] Amen.
[23:52] It's beyond finding. God has no more
[23:56] RECORD OF IT. SATAN'S GOT A record of
[23:58] everything you've done. He keeps a
[23:59] record. He keeps a record of all your
[24:01] failures, all your sins, all your
[24:04] mistakes. But let me tell you something.
[24:06] God has no record of that this morning.
[24:08] If you've said, "Oh God, no good in me,
[24:11] but I take I take that precious blood
[24:14] that was shed for me at Calvary. Oh God,
[24:16] let it cover my sins this morning. You
[24:19] promised, oh God, and I believe your
[24:21] word. I believe you. Don't matter what
[24:23] the devil tries to bring up. Let me tell
[24:25] you something. God's got a record book,
[24:27] too. And this record book is the record
[24:29] of the redeemed. It's your name is
[24:31] written down when you believe it this
[24:33] morning. God's got a record book. Amen.
[24:36] The devil's got one, too. I don't care
[24:38] about his record book. He can take it
[24:40] and go on somewhere with it cuz he's a
[24:42] liar and he's a father of lies. Amen.
[24:44] But what's the worst thing that'll
[24:46] happen if you believe God? If you say,
[24:48] "I trust him with all of my heart. I
[24:50] trust him with my life. I trust him with
[24:52] my family. I believe I'm healed." It
[24:55] don't matter if the doctor says you're
[24:56] dying of cancer. It don't matter if the
[24:58] doctor says you've got heart trouble. It
[25:01] don't matter. It's like somebody pulling
[25:02] up to your house. Brother Donnie
[25:04] preached this. We don't want no snakes.
[25:06] I don't want no snakes either. But he
[25:08] preached this message. He said, "It's
[25:10] like a a FedEx truck pulling up to your
[25:13] house and knocking on the door. I've got
[25:15] a package for you. You need a sign for
[25:17] it." Oh, and and he got a box here and
[25:20] you can hear them rattling in there and
[25:22] a HISSING AND IT'S RATTLESNAKES. I DON'T
[25:25] WANT THOSE RATTLESNAKES. WELL, they're
[25:26] yours. I've got a sign, Docy. It says
[25:28] right right here from the very pits of
[25:31] hell be elabub. Uh, care of you. Oh, no,
[25:35] it ain't mine. I don't want that box of
[25:37] rattlesnakes. You just you just take it
[25:38] on back. I CAN'T TAKE IT BACK. WELL, I
[25:40] TELL YOU WHAT YOU DO. YOU LEAVE IT RIGHT
[25:41] HERE ON the doorstep then CUZ I AIN'T
[25:43] BRINGING IN my house.
[25:45] YOU MIGHT WALK OUT EVERY day and as
[25:47] you're going to work and YOU HAVE TO DO
[25:48] THIS RIGHT HERE GETTING BY. You might
[25:50] hear them rattling. That might be the
[25:52] symptoms IN YOUR BODY. YOU MIGHT HAVE
[25:54] PAIN. YOU MIGHT THE DOCTOR MIGHT TELL
[25:56] YOU EVERY DAY. YOU MIGHT GET A REPORT.
[25:58] OH, YOU'RE DYING. You're dying. The
[26:00] devil. YOU WAKE UP IN THE MORNING. I GOT
[26:01] I'M HURTING. OH, SOME rattlesnakes
[26:03] outside. BUT I'M NOT ACCEPTING IT. I'm
[26:05] not SIGNING FOR IT. IT'S THE DEVIL CAN
[26:07] TAKE HIM RIGHT ON BACK TO HELL WHERE HE
[26:09] BROUGHT HIM from and you just keep on
[26:10] I'm not bringing them to my house. I'm
[26:12] not signing for it.
[26:14] You can say, "Well, you're living in
[26:15] denial." Let me tell you something.
[26:17] That's what the That's what the world
[26:18] says today. IF YOU BELIEVE GOD, you're
[26:21] living in denial. I'll live in denial.
[26:23] Let me live in denial. I'll stay there.
[26:25] I deny everything the devil tries to
[26:27] give me. I deny THE SIN. I DENY the
[26:30] unbelief. I DENY THE DOUBT. I DENY THE
[26:32] SICKNESS.
[26:34] I deny all of it. Amen.
[26:38] But I believe God. How many believes him
[26:41] this morning? You believe him?
[26:42] Oh my.
[26:44] Faith comes by hearing and hearing by
[26:46] the word of God. Let me just be a pep
[26:49] rally this MORNING TO YOU.
[26:51] OH, IT'S WORTH IT ALL.
[26:53] But what's the worst thing that can
[26:55] happen if even you're trusting God and
[26:57] you're saying, "I'm healed. I'm healed.
[26:59] I believe what he said. I'm healed." And
[27:01] you still die. What's the worst thing
[27:03] can happen? you still die. You You might
[27:06] die, but you still trust in God. Oh
[27:08] [laughter] my I'd rather die trusting
[27:10] God and and on my dying lips saying,
[27:13] "I'm healed. I'm saved. I'm filled WITH
[27:17] THE HOLY GHOST. MY FAMILY SEALED." AMEN.
[27:20] What a testimony.
[27:22] Devil might get the last He might get
[27:24] the last punch in. That's all right.
[27:27] Die with that testimony on your lips.
[27:30] LIVE with that testimony on your lips.
[27:32] Oh my my mama just passed last two weeks
[27:36] ago and she all the devil fought her so
[27:40] much. I know I got to quit. I just want
[27:41] to tell you this. All her life he always
[27:44] told her, "Well, it's for everybody
[27:46] else. You're not saved. You look at what
[27:49] you did. Look, look at the sin you've
[27:51] done." And and oh, it bothered her. She
[27:53] said, "I know." She told me at Christmas
[27:55] time, she said, "I just don't think I
[27:56] got much longer to go." And I just
[27:58] talked to her and she said it really
[27:59] helped her. I I told her that about the
[28:01] blood, the drop of ink in the pool of
[28:04] bleach and how that it's not even not
[28:05] even God can't even find it anymore.
[28:08] Oh my. If you went to [laughter]
[28:11] [snorts]
[28:16] Oh my
[28:18] She [snorts] said helped her so much.
[28:24] [snorts] Think I'd be my my handkerchief
[28:26] this morning for Sunday school lesson. I
[28:29] usually have to have when I'm preaching.
[28:31] She said it helped her so much.
