[26:08] [Music]
[26:12] it's good to be in the house of the Lord
[26:14] tonight
[26:15] it's always good to be in the house of
[26:17] the Lord
[26:18] um ask that uh Jackson if you could drop
[26:20] my monitors if you wouldn't mind kinda I
[26:24] don't like to hear myself
[26:26] uh but uh yeah it's good it's
[26:29] Thanksgiving week and we're it's always
[26:31] a lot to be thankful for I always it
[26:34] bothers me that it seems like in America
[26:36] we have the holiday season that starts
[26:39] for Halloween and they always have a big
[26:41] Halloween thing and everything's
[26:43] Halloween and then as soon as November
[26:45] first rolls around it's Christmas
[26:47] and Thanksgiving is just not on the
[26:50] calendar somehow
[26:51] and it's almost like it's hard to
[26:53] commercialize a holiday about being
[26:55] thankful for what you have and that's
[26:56] why they don't
[26:58] um
[27:00] so uh yeah it's it's always I always
[27:02] have a soft spot for Thanksgiving
[27:04] because
[27:06] it's always good to be thankful
[27:08] and I guess that's going to be all for
[27:10] the music
[27:11] um we'll we'll have a
[27:13] read our scripture here
[27:15] Ephesians chapter 10.
[27:19] I'm sorry um hang on I don't think it's
[27:21] chapter 10 Ephesians chapter six
[27:31] notes Here
[27:47] there we go
[28:01] foreign
[28:14] chapter 6 and verse 10.
[28:18] finally my brethren be strong in the
[28:20] Lord and in the power of His might
[28:23] put on the whole armor of God that you
[28:25] may be able to stand against The Wiles
[28:27] of the devil
[28:28] for we wrestle not against flesh and
[28:30] blood but against principalities means
[28:33] powers
[28:34] against the rulers of the darkness of
[28:36] this world against spiritual wickedness
[28:38] in high places
[28:41] bow our hearts
[28:44] oh gracious and
[28:46] Heavenly Father
[28:48] Lord I come before you this this evening
[28:51] father your servant my heart and mind
[28:53] open to you father that I would bring
[28:56] nothing of of my own but that only that
[28:59] which you would Inspire for these people
[29:00] to hear
[29:01] that they would be able to
[29:05] hear your word tonight and through that
[29:07] word build their faith
[29:10] that
[29:12] in this wicked and dark day that they
[29:13] would be able to stand against the devil
[29:16] and meet him at every turn
[29:17] and would drive him back
[29:19] and would would take that land in their
[29:22] life that you would ordain for them
[29:24] Father that there would be nothing no no
[29:27] stronghold left uncasted down within
[29:30] their life father
[29:31] and we ask these things in your holy and
[29:34] precious name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[29:35] amen
[29:37] you all can be seated
[29:42] so
[29:53] this this verse here
[29:56] um
[29:59] verse 12 for we wrestle not against
[30:01] flesh and blood but against
[30:03] principalities against Powers against
[30:05] the rulers of the darkness of this world
[30:09] again spiritual wickedness in high
[30:11] places
[30:16] so many times I feel like
[30:19] we read this I mean this is a familiar
[30:20] scripture everyone's heard this we heard
[30:22] it for instance we're in Sunday School
[30:25] and um
[30:29] the way I I feel like many years ago
[30:32] brother Jason did a a thing I think it
[30:34] was might have been Ephesians or
[30:35] Corinthians I don't remember which where
[30:36] he took a chapter and he would put it up
[30:38] on this on the screen and you know he
[30:40] he'd have the what we would think of as
[30:42] you know the the uh our our
[30:45] interpretation of it our our translation
[30:47] of this right
[30:49] and it's you know you have the actual
[30:50] scripture and then our version is like
[30:52] oh well it's this but and we can kind of
[30:54] we can kind of you know
[30:56] skirt the edges here
[30:57] you know it doesn't really mean that
[31:00] well
[31:03] so I would think you know that that the
[31:05] the
[31:07] you know our our in practice
[31:10] interpretation of the scripture would be
[31:13] something like
[31:14] you know um we we wrestle against mental
[31:18] hardships that in some aspect resemble a
[31:21] war
[31:23] it's it's an analogy to war
[31:27] it's a it's a it's a simile of War
[31:32] is it really though
[31:34] right because that's not what the Bible
[31:35] says
[31:36] the Bible says it's a war and it's
[31:40] actually a conflict
[31:44] and because it's a war because it's we
[31:46] we understand that it's a war so it's a
[31:48] real war with real stakes and real risks
[31:50] oh thank you brother
[31:52] kind of need that already
[31:54] um
[32:04] there's there's risk involved in this
[32:06] you know Wars have consequences
[32:10] you know in the olden days when the
[32:12] Mongols are you know riding across the
[32:14] land
[32:15] and burning and pillaging and everything
[32:17] that they come across you know there's
[32:19] there's consequences for losing those
[32:21] battles you know if you're some footmen
[32:24] out there on the fields and and you die
[32:26] and you lose the fight or you you cut
[32:28] and run and abandon the field
[32:30] your home is next
[32:33] and your family and your kids and your
[32:36] wife
[32:37] and everything else and everything that
[32:39] you know and love gets wiped out and
[32:40] taken and enslaved
[32:44] and that's the consequences of War you
[32:47] know
[32:50] and we see this
[32:52] now in in Christian EX in in their
[32:54] spiritual war you know
[32:57] there's there's consequences to losing
[32:59] those spiritual battles those
[33:00] consequences for not being
[33:03] on your game right consequences for not
[33:06] having your sword sharpened ready
[33:08] you know
[33:10] you know we we think oh well it's an
[33:12] analogy to war well
[33:16] you know when your kids are dealing with
[33:18] an addiction and are enslaved to
[33:21] something because there wasn't a strong
[33:24] man in the home to hold the devil back
[33:27] well that's not much of an analogy is it
[33:29] right it's not metaphorical anymore
[33:32] right
[33:35] and so because of this because we don't
[33:36] take it seriously we don't consider the
[33:38] fact that it's an actual War we tend to
[33:40] be Lacks
[33:42] and we don't we're not as diligent we're
[33:44] not on top of things we're not as um
[33:49] you know uh we're not squared away as
[33:51] they say in the military right
[33:53] because you know in the military where
[33:55] there where there's actual you know
[33:57] physical conflict you get that feedback
[33:58] immediately
[33:59] there's no tolerance for being loose
[34:02] right you know I mean literally when
[34:05] when soldiers go in into are going into
[34:07] combat one of the things that Sergeant
[34:09] will do before they go out he'll grab
[34:10] them their chest record
[34:13] and shake them really hard
[34:15] because there's anything rattling around
[34:16] sounds like a cowbell rattling around in
[34:18] your backpack
[34:20] well you can't come with us like that
[34:22] you're they're going to hear you a mile
[34:23] away right you're you know stuff is just
[34:26] you know laying around willy-nilly uh
[34:28] well when artillery starts shaking the
[34:30] ground stuff's gonna fall apart you know
[34:32] it's going to be tight it's going to be
[34:33] strapped down tight squared away
[34:34] organized when bullets are flying you
[34:38] you can't have your stuff just packed in
[34:40] your way it's going to be organized and
[34:41] neat because you don't have time
[34:44] to be figuring it out
[34:46] right
[34:47] well
[34:49] what do we do
[34:50] right we're loose we're loose on
[34:53] security you know they in you know spent
[34:57] 20 years in Afghanistan and Iraq and
[34:59] they'd have to build military outposts
[35:01] in a war zone
[35:02] right they've got House people there for
[35:04] years
[35:05] well when they're there
[35:07] look at their security we're talking
[35:08] concrete walls and barricades and guard
[35:11] towers with searchlights and one way in
[35:13] and out with multiple Gates and
[35:15] redundancies and anybody coming through
[35:17] that gate is going to be is going to be
[35:19] screened and checked if you ain't got
[35:21] papers to be there you get shot
[35:23] right because they're not playing around
[35:24] right right if if the guy's on guard
[35:28] fail their Duty their friends die
[35:32] right well
[35:35] what do we do
[35:37] you know if you're I mean just imagine
[35:39] yourself as some as some guy in charge
[35:40] of security in a in a you know facility
[35:42] in a war zone
[35:43] you know and and you're out out in
[35:45] Afghanistan and there's a you know
[35:48] there's some guy you know he's a I don't
[35:51] know ice cream salesman
[35:53] hanging around your base
[35:56] and he's like hey you know mind if I
[35:58] come in and sell ice cream well who are
[36:00] you
[36:01] so you do a background checking you know
[36:02] he's got no affiliations you know he's
[36:05] he's not involved in anything you know
[36:07] not involved anything uh not a known
[36:09] terrorist or anything
[36:11] but your background checks shows that
[36:13] all his family is
[36:15] all his cousins are
[36:17] all of his friends are everyone he hangs
[36:21] out with is known you know Taliban
[36:24] members
[36:25] will you let that guy in you deserve to
[36:28] be fired probably out of a cannon right
[36:31] because his associations make him
[36:34] suspect
[36:36] but how often will we be like well
[36:40] this particular entertainment isn't bad
[36:43] it's not nothing wrong with it directly
[36:45] but everything associated with it is
[36:48] absolutely poisonous
[36:50] right everything around it every oh you
[36:53] know this well this this sporting is
[36:55] just a sporting event yeah okay but the
[36:58] halftime show is Straight From Hell and
[37:01] you know the the cheerleaders and every
[37:03] ad that you're gonna watch you know
[37:04] while you're watching it is gonna is
[37:06] gonna just completely pollute the minds
[37:07] of everyone involved so everything is
[37:10] associated with it is is toxic but ah
[37:13] well it's just this thing well no it's
[37:15] not
[37:16] right and and we think like oh that's
[37:19] just it's just a sporting thing we just
[37:21] watched the game and it's is it that big
[37:22] of a deal well is it
[37:24] right is it really
[37:27] you know it's like oh you know imagine
[37:29] some guy just hanging out in the
[37:30] battlefield bullets flying around him ah
[37:32] it's just some bullets
[37:34] you know it's just it's just you know oh
[37:37] it's just a martillary it's not a big
[37:38] deal
[37:40] you know it's just as lethal
[37:44] it'll kill you worse than the bullets
[37:46] will
[37:47] you know
[37:48] bullets bullets don't really kill you
[37:51] right they just they just bring you to a
[37:53] a new form of life
[37:57] right
[37:58] uh spiritual corruption will kill you
[38:01] for real
[38:02] kill you in a way that bullets can't
[38:07] and so
[38:08] and part of this is It's
[38:13] because because we end up not training
[38:16] correctly right we don't take it
[38:17] seriously we're not diligent we're not
[38:18] squared away we're not we're not trained
[38:20] properly or we don't allow ourselves to
[38:22] be trained properly
[38:24] and part of that is I I wish I had the
[38:27] picture I tried to send to the booth I
[38:29] just could not make it work so you have
[38:31] to use the power of imagination I'm
[38:33] going to describe it to you it's real
[38:34] simple
[38:35] so imagine this picture right and it's
[38:37] just the ocean blue as far as you can
[38:39] see nice calm glassy sea all the way
[38:41] across under it are the words
[38:44] an epic submarine battle
[38:48] right
[38:49] you can't see it
[38:52] it's there though
[38:54] there's submarines all under you and
[38:56] they're all firing Torpedoes back and
[38:57] forth and it's this crazy epic battle
[39:00] that you can't see
[39:02] now you're standing on a boat it's
[39:04] floating out in the ocean you know
[39:07] on a on your on your you know two-hour
[39:10] Cruise doing your thing
[39:12] but there's a war raging underneath of
[39:14] you now your boat's halfway in and
[39:16] halfway out of that fight
[39:17] yeah right part of you is down there
[39:19] under that surface
[39:21] well we people
[39:23] we're made up of well it's we're Triune
[39:25] being right you have a body this is the
[39:27] thing that everybody sees this is the
[39:28] part sticking up out of the water we're
[39:30] standing on the deck we're seeing what's
[39:31] sticking up out of the water
[39:33] but there's another part of you under
[39:35] that water called your spirit man
[39:37] that has five senses that interacts in
[39:40] that spirit in in that submarine space
[39:47] and you can't really observe that unless
[39:49] you have some special equipment and you
[39:51] have your ears open
[39:54] but
[39:57] doesn't mean the submarine battle isn't
[39:58] there
[39:59] right and it doesn't mean that submarine
[40:01] battle doesn't directly affect your life
[40:03] because if you know
[40:05] enemy sub is there
[40:07] You're Gonna Know It real quick
[40:10] you know it's only a matter of time
[40:12] before suddenly and and you know people
[40:14] who don't have their sonar on don't have
[40:16] their spiritual ears open aren't looking
[40:18] and listening and keeping their eyes
[40:20] open
[40:21] suddenly one day they don't understand
[40:22] why their whole everything just exploded
[40:26] I have no idea is this is a shock well
[40:29] okay it's because there was a there was
[40:31] a war going on that you weren't paying
[40:33] attention to
[40:34] and now you're wondering and you know
[40:36] think think about the
[40:39] in the second world war you have all the
[40:41] um the shipping going across the the
[40:43] ocean to to Europe and the Germans were
[40:46] notorious for running submarines up and
[40:49] down the all through the Atlantic uh
[40:51] hitting unsuspecting cargo ships and
[40:53] they'd be in packs you know just whole
[40:55] fleets of these ships all sailing
[40:56] together and suddenly one of them just
[40:58] explodes
[41:00] and all the other ships
[41:03] because they know what's going you know
[41:04] they know what's going on suddenly
[41:05] they're they weren't paying attention
[41:06] and suddenly one of their friends just
[41:07] explodes
[41:09] so now they now they're all looking for
[41:11] for you know they're now paying
[41:12] attention
[41:13] and so a lot of times you know we're
[41:15] Christians and we're just floating along
[41:16] the Sea of life not paying attention and
[41:18] then when our friends explode we're
[41:20] going what happened well it's because we
[41:23] weren't we weren't looking out for each
[41:24] other we weren't fighting that spiritual
[41:26] battle right we weren't we weren't
[41:29] focused on these things and so it
[41:31] behooves us
[41:33] to really get on our game
[41:35] get squared away and and think about
[41:38] this because again it is not
[41:42] excuse me it is not
[41:45] a metaphorical war that we are in and
[41:48] because it's not a metaphorical it's an
[41:50] actual War it's just fought in a
[41:51] different realm that we're not attuned
[41:53] to
[41:55] we can apply a lot of the same
[41:57] principles and and methodology from
[41:59] physical Warfare into spiritual warfare
[42:01] a lot of the same principles apply right
[42:04] you know we hear that you've heard the
[42:05] phrase the natural types the spiritual
[42:06] which I always thought was interesting
[42:08] that it didn't say the spiritual types
[42:09] the natural
[42:10] right it's it's actually the other way
[42:12] you know you know like I said this
[42:15] mentality of like oh well the spirit war
[42:16] is just a metaphor for this physical War
[42:19] what's actually the other way around
[42:20] right
[42:22] so
[42:24] I want to um because of that you know in
[42:27] taking that that thought I want to kind
[42:30] of take a look at at Warfare in general
[42:31] I'm going to take a big picture of it
[42:33] I'm going to narrow it down ultimately
[42:35] down to sort of the individual and kind
[42:38] of show how how to approach sort of
[42:41] spiritual warfare
[42:44] um through a natural Warfare lens
[42:48] um and so the first thing
[42:52] um I'd like to like to it's a just a
[42:55] sort of a key thing that
[42:58] um anytime you start studying Warfare
[43:00] and especially large scale stuff there's
[43:02] a saying those two sayings
[43:04] I think our
[43:06] um probably key
[43:09] the first one is a is a European Western
[43:11] European military proverb that goes
[43:14] amateurs study strategy or tactics
[43:18] and professionals study Logistics
[43:21] okay
[43:22] what does that mean
[43:25] well Logistics
[43:28] defined by Webster's is the aspect of
[43:32] military science dealing with the
[43:33] procurement maintenance and
[43:35] transportation of military material
[43:37] facilities and personnel and also the
[43:41] handling of the details of an operation
[43:43] okay so in kind of normal people speak
[43:47] that is how do all the stuff get to the
[43:51] battle and how does all the information
[43:52] and how do we communicate right how do
[43:54] the orders move how do the tanks move
[43:56] how do where's all the fuel where's all
[43:58] the bullets where's all the Band-Aids
[43:59] where's all the food how's it getting
[44:01] there okay
[44:05] so going back to this idea that
[44:07] professional study tactics or I'm sorry
[44:09] amateur city tax professional study
[44:10] Logistics you know most people are
[44:12] looking for the outside think oh well
[44:13] learning how to fight a war is all about
[44:14] you know figuring out how to outmaneuver
[44:16] the enemy and our guys are here and
[44:18] their guys are there and how to you know
[44:19] move through this difficult terrain to
[44:21] approach them and all this stuff like
[44:22] nah I mean maybe I mean it's important
[44:24] I'm not saying it's not important but in
[44:26] the grand scheme of things you could
[44:27] have awful tactics and phenomenal
[44:30] Logistics and in the big picture you
[44:33] might lose a lot of battles but you will
[44:34] win the war eventually right I mean
[44:36] again look at the Germans in the second
[44:38] world war they had phenomenal tactics
[44:40] they they were that's the best they
[44:42] completely invented whole doctrines of
[44:44] war that we still use today and that's
[44:45] why they were completely feared
[44:47] especially early on
[44:49] but their logistical infrastructure the
[44:51] the the supply of keeping fuel to the
[44:54] tanks was appalling a lot of people
[44:56] don't realize it was a huge percentage
[44:58] of their supply train was horse and
[45:00] buggy
[45:01] in an age of of trucks right and so they
[45:05] would have these insane offensive pushes
[45:08] where they push hundreds and hundreds of
[45:10] miles in the space of a couple of months
[45:12] and then run out of fuel 30 miles from
[45:15] their objective and then have to sit on
[45:16] their hands for three months waiting for
[45:18] the supply lines to catch up at which
[45:19] point you know it turns winner in Russia
[45:21] and they all freeze to death
[45:23] right and it's all because their tactics
[45:26] were amazing but their Logistics were
[45:27] horrendous
[45:28] okay and so ultimately you look at the
[45:31] other side the Russians they had
[45:33] horrible tactics right Stalin executed
[45:36] all of his generals before the war they
[45:38] had no experience Commanders
[45:39] their tactics were horrific
[45:42] but they're they're Logistics
[45:45] were amazing they had an incredible
[45:47] manufacturing capabilities so they could
[45:51] just lose a lot of battles and they just
[45:52] had more to go
[45:54] right and so spiritually speaking a lot
[45:59] of times we're sitting here thinking
[46:01] about how do we combat the devil in this
[46:03] one particular situation or that
[46:05] particular situation and then we're
[46:06] getting focused on win loss column
[46:08] because we're trying to win all these
[46:09] micro battles but in the reality in the
[46:11] grand scheme of things where you're
[46:12] actually winning the war is logistics is
[46:16] how are you feeding yourself spiritually
[46:18] how are you arming yourself spiritually
[46:21] how are you making sure that the
[46:24] machines of your spiritual warfare are
[46:26] going forward and being fueled because
[46:28] it's it's only a matter of time right
[46:31] now we've completely changed the change
[46:33] the game right you're it's no longer
[46:36] focused on well I lost today well so
[46:39] what we got more there's more where that
[46:41] came from right and
[46:44] the other because the other side of this
[46:47] there's a famous you might have heard of
[46:48] a guy by the name of Sun Tzu literally
[46:50] turned Warfare into an art
[46:52] um Chinese guy ancient Chinese proverb
[46:55] um he has this phenomenal quote and if
[46:58] you get your head around this it applies
[46:59] to so much of life but it goes that
[47:02] um Victorious armies win first and then
[47:04] go to battle
[47:06] and defeated armies go to battle and
[47:09] then seek to win
[47:10] right the idea here being that the wars
[47:13] and battles of your life are one off the
[47:17] battlefield they're one in the months
[47:19] and weeks and days and years of
[47:21] preparation and hard work and diligence
[47:23] and staying on top of things and making
[47:25] sure that you read and prayed and listen
[47:27] to the tapes every single day up until
[47:30] that point right it's it's like a it's
[47:33] like a an athlete I once heard an
[47:35] athlete crazy athletic events all these
[47:37] crazy obstacle courses and he said they
[47:40] asked him you know how do you you know
[47:41] what's it like on race day you know when
[47:43] you're uh you know gonna go out there
[47:46] and perform and he's like you know what
[47:47] the reality is I did not win on race day
[47:49] I won in the months leading up to that
[47:52] when I was in the gym
[47:55] you know doing all these insane exercise
[47:57] routines to prepare myself for that day
[47:59] it's like I won in the months leading up
[48:01] to that race day was just when I got to
[48:03] get the trophy
[48:05] wow right and the reality is most of the
[48:08] time most you know when we're out there
[48:09] trying to fight the devil
[48:11] we've neglected
[48:13] our Logistics and we're wondering why
[48:16] we're getting just murdered why we have
[48:19] no faith got no faith to fight a
[48:21] toothache when was the last time you
[48:23] picked up a Bible
[48:25] right when was the last time you pressed
[48:26] play on a tape and and listened to
[48:28] something edifying when was the last
[48:31] time you chose you know not YouTube
[48:35] like anything else really
[48:38] um you know when was
[48:40] and so this is this is the big picture
[48:43] right this is the big picture of
[48:47] you know if you're gonna win the war
[48:48] this is why we say don't get hung up on
[48:50] win loss column don't get hug on all I
[48:53] lost today well okay
[48:55] today was a was a was a bad day
[48:57] tomorrow's a new one his mercies are new
[48:59] in the morning wake up put on your boots
[49:02] open your Bible pray read turn on the
[49:06] tape do it all over again you know and
[49:09] the thing is and and don't forget
[49:10] everything that you know about logistics
[49:13] so does the devil and he understands
[49:16] that when you're gonna try to break an
[49:18] enemy you're gonna do it by crushing
[49:19] their supply lines so every morning when
[49:22] you go to open your Bible the phone's
[49:25] gonna ring right every morning when you
[49:27] go to do something Something's Gonna
[49:29] Come up the temptation to pick up that
[49:32] phone first thing in the morning is
[49:34] gonna be there right
[49:36] you know the the temptation to distract
[49:39] you he's going to not make it easy but
[49:42] you have to push through right that's
[49:43] why it's a fight
[49:45] so
[49:47] um where am I at here oh goodness time
[49:51] is going
[49:52] um so uh
[49:58] so I want to I want to kind of focus
[50:01] down a little bit farther there's a
[50:02] hopefully not spend too much time on
[50:03] this
[50:04] concept
[50:06] um in you know now that's kind of big
[50:08] picture I want to focus on a little bit
[50:09] farther maybe to something a lot smaller
[50:13] um there is a tool that is used by
[50:16] officers on the battlefield called met
[50:18] TC it's an acronym it's
[50:21] m-e-t-t-t-c okay and it's an acronym
[50:24] that stands for Mission enemy terrain
[50:26] troops and support time and civilian
[50:29] considerations okay these are all the
[50:31] factors of the battle that you need to
[50:33] consider when you are figuring out how
[50:34] to approach this fight okay
[50:37] so let's look at this kind of from top
[50:39] down because you can really apply this
[50:41] spiritually and it'll
[50:43] it's kind of amazing I I was kind of
[50:46] learning about this and I thought to
[50:47] myself you know okay let's try this sort
[50:49] of in a spiritual sense and I was
[50:50] actually very shocked at how
[50:53] how well it helps you kind of approach
[50:54] things
[50:56] um so let's get at the mission right
[50:58] what's your mission and you know you
[51:00] don't you don't want to get too too big
[51:01] and you know uh brought a scale because
[51:04] it's not like well if you're the
[51:05] Infantry man you're not thinking about
[51:06] like what is the mission of the you know
[51:07] entire third Army no it's what is your
[51:09] mission for you right so you know when
[51:12] you're thinking what is my mission well
[51:13] it's not okay we're going in a Rapture
[51:15] okay yeah that is but it's not we're
[51:17] talking about today right what what is
[51:19] your what are you working with today
[51:23] and so the the your mission we might say
[51:25] for for a a a Christian on any given
[51:29] days you know and now maybe you have
[51:31] some specific thing you know specific
[51:33] struggle in your life maybe you're a
[51:35] minister and have some specific
[51:36] spiritual thing that you're approaching
[51:38] maybe you have a mission trip or or
[51:40] something like that or there's a
[51:41] specific need in your life that you're
[51:42] working with you know you can
[51:45] fill that in I'm just saying for the
[51:46] general we can say like a general thing
[51:48] that we would all maybe put here is
[51:50] maybe do your Logistics right it would
[51:53] be nice every day to wake up and read
[51:55] your Bible and pray and spend time with
[51:57] God and listen to tapes and and not be
[51:59] distracted by carnal entertainment and
[52:01] not be distracted by things of the world
[52:02] and just sort of have a nice walk with
[52:05] God today that's our mission for today
[52:07] okay
[52:09] now
[52:13] who's our enemy
[52:15] now I don't know about you but my enemy
[52:17] in this mission is usually the
[52:19] reflection I see in my phone screen when
[52:21] I pick it up
[52:23] right that's usually my biggest enemy in
[52:25] this in this scenario right the guy
[52:27] who's holding the phone
[52:30] the
[52:31] you know and so ultimately you're you're
[52:34] you're fighting against this flesh thing
[52:37] that you're having to drag around right
[52:39] I actually recall
[52:41] um
[52:42] uh
[52:44] uh the
[52:45] um
[52:47] in in in the Bible when it's when it
[52:49] talks about the the man of Flesh that
[52:52] Paul talks about that you're kind of
[52:53] tied to I'm kind of going off the top of
[52:55] my head so I remember exactly what the
[52:56] what the scripture is but
[52:58] um the the uh the the reference that
[53:01] he's making there is actually to an old
[53:02] ancient form of execution where they
[53:04] would shackle a prisoner that would
[53:06] shackle prisoner to another prisoner and
[53:07] then kill the other prisoner and so you
[53:09] have to drag her on a dead body
[53:11] and then as that dead body rots it
[53:13] infects you with the rot and you die
[53:15] horribly it's awful
[53:17] um
[53:18] and so now so this is this is the man of
[53:20] Flesh that we're having to drag around
[53:21] this dead carcass that infects our
[53:23] spirit and our and our soul right
[53:25] and so that's the enemy that you're
[53:27] fighting against
[53:28] and the terrain everybody knows train
[53:30] greatest battle ever fought the
[53:31] battlefield is in your mind
[53:33] right
[53:34] now if I could if I could potentially
[53:36] open your open your field of view a
[53:38] little bit on what exactly that means
[53:39] right because we think well it's you
[53:42] know my feelings and my thoughts and
[53:43] different things and you know we think
[53:44] that the five spiritual senses uh uh
[53:47] things I could do it off my head is a
[53:49] memory affections reasoning
[53:52] conscience and Imagination okay
[53:55] these are five spiritual senses now
[53:57] we think of these as well there's my
[53:59] spirit man over here and then my flesh
[54:01] man over here and there's kind of a line
[54:02] there and they don't cross well hang on
[54:04] a minute
[54:05] memory is one of your five spiritual
[54:08] senses right well imagine a situation
[54:10] where someone's walking along and they
[54:11] get hit on the head and suddenly they
[54:13] have amnesia
[54:14] well they had to damage their physical
[54:16] man
[54:17] but their Spirit man is crippled
[54:19] the spirit man lost a physical or a
[54:21] spiritual sense so there's a there's way
[54:23] more connection there than you think
[54:25] it's all part of the flesh it's all part
[54:27] of the flesh man right it's just an
[54:28] extension of that into like you said
[54:30] it's all part of the same boat just part
[54:32] of it's under the under the surface that
[54:33] you can't see
[54:35] and on the conver the other side of this
[54:38] um I don't have time to really pull them
[54:40] up there's a uh um many scriptures where
[54:42] the brand is dealing with people in in
[54:43] discernment and he talks about oh you
[54:45] know Sister you have you have a heart
[54:47] condition well it's actually a nervous
[54:48] condition right what is it it's a it's a
[54:50] spiritual Affliction that she has it's
[54:52] manifesting through her body and causing
[54:53] her physical damage right so you know
[54:57] when we're when we're
[54:59] um
[55:00] we were talking about the battlefield is
[55:02] in your mind
[55:03] your mind is a lot right your mind is a
[55:07] much bigger thing than just sort of like
[55:09] this ephemeral sort of nebulous concept
[55:11] that kind of floats around your head
[55:12] right it's actually manifests into your
[55:14] body
[55:15] right so
[55:18] also sort of attached to that something
[55:21] to consider especially in this day and
[55:23] age
[55:25] um I just recently was looking into how
[55:29] um recently there was some some new
[55:30] science coming out about how uh the use
[55:34] of antidepressants
[55:36] was actually not as useful as a lot of a
[55:39] lot of the medicine thought they're
[55:40] actually having a hard time replicating
[55:42] the antidepressant effects
[55:46] um now
[55:47] um since after the original studies
[55:49] excuse me
[55:51] um
[55:52] and they said that a lot in a lot of
[55:55] their studies diet and exercise were
[55:57] actually about as on par as an
[55:59] antidepressant pill in terms of of
[56:00] controlling uh depression
[56:03] and in fact a lot of psychiatrists will
[56:06] won't even give you pills until you do
[56:09] some major diet and exercise changes so
[56:11] what this is telling me is that
[56:14] you know we'll be going around having
[56:16] all kinds of depression issues and all
[56:17] kinds of spiritual battles and anxiety
[56:19] and different things think oh man I'm
[56:21] under such a you know spiritual warfare
[56:24] while you're eating what you know it's
[56:28] like
[56:29] um there's a really eye-opening
[56:32] experience if you ever go to Flagstaff
[56:33] there's a big
[56:35] um big grain silo with a Purina dog food
[56:38] logo on it the red and white square
[56:40] checkered thing
[56:42] and if you're driving and you see this
[56:44] thing oh there's the Purina plants where
[56:45] they make dog food
[56:46] and then when you go up to the front
[56:48] gate of that thing on a little bitty
[56:50] sign next to it it says Nabisco Foods
[56:53] and literally the same plant that
[56:56] manufactures uh Purina kibble for your
[56:59] dog is the same place that makes
[57:01] Cheez-Its
[57:02] um
[57:03] so
[57:04] just consider
[57:07] just consider that the next time you're
[57:09] eating a cheese it
[57:10] um no the the reality is you know we'll
[57:14] sit there and stuff our face with stuff
[57:15] that we would be offended by if it was
[57:18] in a different package
[57:20] um that's just the reality and and we're
[57:22] eating this stuff and wondering why do I
[57:24] have all these major mental problems
[57:25] that I'm having those because your body
[57:27] is screaming for some nutrients it
[57:28] doesn't even know how to make the
[57:29] chemicals that make you feel okay
[57:31] right you're so you know have all kinds
[57:34] of chemical imbalance in your head
[57:35] because your nutrition is trash we're in
[57:38] the standard American diet of dog food
[57:41] um
[57:42] you know and so and so again like so
[57:44] we're not considering that your
[57:46] spiritual battles a lot of times we're
[57:47] being fought on your dinner plate
[57:49] yeah so
[57:51] um
[57:52] I mean there's a just consider maybe
[57:54] there's a reason Jehovah took so much
[57:56] care and what the the Israelites ate
[57:58] just saying I don't want to I don't want
[58:00] to spend too much time on that it's just
[58:02] supposed to be a side note
[58:04] um believe me and if anyone feels
[58:06] attacked I am pointing at myself way
[58:07] more than anybody else
[58:09] um so uh uh anyway so um moving down um
[58:15] in our considerations how to approach
[58:16] things you have your civilian
[58:18] considerations at the end of that oh I'm
[58:19] sorry there was time time was the other
[58:20] important thing
[58:22] um
[58:24] typically time your time frame when
[58:26] you're out you're approaching a battle
[58:27] how much time do you have to work with
[58:28] this right really depends what your
[58:30] goals are depending on whether you're
[58:31] attacking or defending if you're
[58:33] defending you want to drag this out as
[58:35] long as possible you want them to spend
[58:37] as much of their fuel as much as their
[58:39] bullets as much as their whatever their
[58:40] resources trying to approach your
[58:42] position as you possibly can that's why
[58:43] you send all kinds of traps and
[58:45] landmines and barbed wire and stuff out
[58:46] there so it slows them down right well
[58:49] if you're on the attack you want to be
[58:50] there like right now right you don't
[58:52] want a bunch of time lingering out in
[58:53] the middle of No Man's Land when you get
[58:55] shot right well think of this
[58:58] spiritually the devil is always
[59:00] defending he's Banning the gates of hell
[59:01] right there's those gates of hell that
[59:03] are keeping you in I'll come back to
[59:05] that case of hell don't keep you out to
[59:07] keep you in
[59:08] right
[59:10] um
[59:11] and
[59:12] he's that's why it's everything's a Time
[59:14] waster you ever notice that those things
[59:16] that always wind you up are time wasters
[59:18] isn't it odd that
[59:20] biggest time waster on Earth is called
[59:22] Tick Tock
[59:23] um
[59:24] right Big D's isn't it interesting that
[59:27] all of these things are done like you
[59:29] know you pick up your phone to and end
[59:31] up on YouTube and then suddenly you go
[59:32] oh wow 45 the 45 minutes of my day that
[59:36] I had to read my Bible and pray are gone
[59:39] right they're time wasters it's it's
[59:41] things that are going to bog you down
[59:43] and slow you down because you're on the
[59:45] attack you're assaulting the gates of
[59:47] hell and he's trying to wind you up in
[59:49] barbed wire in spiritual barbed wire
[59:51] right
[59:53] so don't get caught up in that just go
[59:55] around that stuff don't get caught in it
[59:57] because you need to be on target
[1:00:00] immediately right when you're on the
[1:00:02] attack when you're when your goal is
[1:00:04] logistics right when your goal is okay
[1:00:06] I'm gonna read my Bible I'm going to
[1:00:07] pray I'm going to do these things I'm
[1:00:08] going to have my walk with God I'm going
[1:00:10] to get out ahead of the devil you got to
[1:00:12] be on your game from the word go right
[1:00:15] because you give him a single second
[1:00:17] he's going to shut you down
[1:00:19] okay
[1:00:20] and then you have considering
[1:00:21] consideration I'm going to try to move
[1:00:22] past a lot of this
[1:00:25] uh I just you know consider just
[1:00:27] consider um you know when you're losing
[1:00:29] spiritual battles um and you're you've
[1:00:31] let your attitude become foul to the
[1:00:33] point where you you know chew out the
[1:00:35] cashier at the grocery store for
[1:00:37] shortchange and you 25 cents and
[1:00:38] completely trash your testimony you've
[1:00:40] now made that person a collateral damage
[1:00:41] in your spiritual war
[1:00:43] crash your testimony with that person
[1:00:45] right so you know just consider these
[1:00:48] things be be aware of the way that
[1:00:50] you're of the way you're handling your
[1:00:52] Warfare don't be
[1:00:54] too heavy-handed with things you know
[1:00:56] there's there's a way to especially with
[1:00:58] witnessing there's a way to approach
[1:00:59] people that isn't weak
[1:01:02] and isn't compromising but isn't so
[1:01:05] heavy-handed that you just crushed them
[1:01:08] there's a balance to that you know be
[1:01:10] careful that you're not you're not just
[1:01:13] you know mowing people down because
[1:01:16] you're just really going to let them
[1:01:18] have it about the you know this this
[1:01:20] Ultra Revelation that you have
[1:01:23] okay well hey there's a time and place
[1:01:25] for everything I'm sure that Ultra
[1:01:26] Revelation is great at certain points
[1:01:28] but maybe you know
[1:01:29] maybe be careful with the way that
[1:01:31] you're you're blasting people
[1:01:33] um
[1:01:37] and so there's a I saw a uh what's the
[1:01:41] presentation of an army officer
[1:01:44] describing how to how do you combine the
[1:01:46] the Met TC principles into an actual
[1:01:48] real world situation and use the example
[1:01:50] of a um of a training exercise where
[1:01:52] some of his guys
[1:01:54] that he's training
[1:01:56] um
[1:01:57] we're assaulting a uh a fortified
[1:01:59] position and they they got all hung out
[1:02:02] and out in the wide open we're just
[1:02:03] getting shot to bits by the simulation
[1:02:05] rounds and they get all frustrated no
[1:02:07] this is just a this is a disaster and
[1:02:09] I've quit and he's like all right well
[1:02:11] hang on let's let's think about this for
[1:02:12] a minute
[1:02:13] you know is what's your you know what's
[1:02:15] your mission well my mission is to get
[1:02:17] the bad guys well are you doing that no
[1:02:19] okay
[1:02:20] so you know Christians what's your
[1:02:22] mission well read my Bible and pray have
[1:02:24] a walk with God have a clean life why
[1:02:26] are you doing that no okay well maybe
[1:02:28] we're doing something wrong
[1:02:29] all right
[1:02:31] you know and he's like all right well
[1:02:33] what's your problem well they're over
[1:02:34] there in in you know and he just he just
[1:02:36] goes down the line I'm gonna try to skip
[1:02:37] over some of it but
[1:02:39] um
[1:02:40] you know well the terrain they have
[1:02:41] better terrain well you know I need I
[1:02:43] need uh you know they're just more
[1:02:45] fortified than I am okay well where
[1:02:47] would you be more fortified well over
[1:02:48] there okay why don't you go for there
[1:02:49] right you know hey um I'm just getting
[1:02:53] killed because I'm not you know
[1:02:55] spiritually wiped out because
[1:02:57] I'm not in a place that's spiritually
[1:03:00] conducive right I'm hanging out in areas
[1:03:02] that have bad spirits we'll move right
[1:03:05] it's not that hard
[1:03:07] um it's not that complicated I mean it
[1:03:09] might be difficult spiritually that's
[1:03:10] why it's a fight but it's sometimes you
[1:03:11] got to just grit your teeth and do it
[1:03:13] um
[1:03:15] you know you and you know he talks about
[1:03:17] well I don't have the I don't what's on
[1:03:19] my side right and he has the uh Soldier
[1:03:21] what's what kind of troops and support
[1:03:22] what kind of equipment you have at your
[1:03:24] disposal it's like what would you need
[1:03:25] he's like well I would need a bazooka to
[1:03:27] get those guys out of there well do you
[1:03:28] have a bazooka no so okay that's plans
[1:03:31] out find another way to do this well you
[1:03:34] need
[1:03:35] you know you're approaching this this
[1:03:37] obstacle in your life the spiritual
[1:03:38] stronghold in your life and you keep
[1:03:40] ramming your head into it you know
[1:03:42] you've got some difficult thing that you
[1:03:43] just cannot get over right you know um
[1:03:47] oh I've got some some uh and I'm not and
[1:03:50] bear in mind remember the whole context
[1:03:52] of this is there are people who are
[1:03:53] legitimately trapped in really difficult
[1:03:56] situations like addiction and and
[1:03:59] disease and things that they cannot get
[1:04:01] rid of and those are real strongholds
[1:04:03] and sometimes you approach that and you
[1:04:05] just slam your head into it and go I
[1:04:06] have this thing that I cannot stop doing
[1:04:08] and I've butt my head into this over and
[1:04:10] over and over again I get slaughtered
[1:04:12] every time
[1:04:13] well maybe stop doing that
[1:04:17] just don't back up a minute and this is
[1:04:20] the solution to this to this poor
[1:04:22] soldier's problem his office like look
[1:04:24] just back up you have time
[1:04:27] you have time those guys over there
[1:04:28] they're hiding in those rocks they don't
[1:04:30] have time you can sit right here
[1:04:33] and you can wait and you can pick up the
[1:04:36] phone and you can call your platoon
[1:04:37] commander and say Commander Lieutenant
[1:04:39] I've got a problem can't get these guys
[1:04:42] out could you bring up some
[1:04:43] reinforcements maybe some murders and
[1:04:45] deal with this
[1:04:46] and you can sit here all day to wait for
[1:04:48] it
[1:04:49] right and so many times Christians will
[1:04:51] sit there and beat their head against
[1:04:53] the problem
[1:04:54] trying to resolve this and they get just
[1:04:56] beat all the Thunder
[1:04:59] and instead they need to stop back up
[1:05:02] sit down and call the commander
[1:05:05] and say Lord I've got a problem that I
[1:05:07] can't handle
[1:05:09] right pick up the phone and call some
[1:05:10] reinforcements call your pastor there's
[1:05:13] a novel idea call call your family get
[1:05:16] some people to join together with you in
[1:05:17] prayer and team up on this devil right
[1:05:20] do something that's not just beating
[1:05:22] your head into it and making yourself
[1:05:23] feel like a like a failure
[1:05:26] right do something different
[1:05:28] call the Lord and then once you do once
[1:05:30] you call the commander that doesn't mean
[1:05:32] you go charge it again you wait until
[1:05:35] the commander shows up and deals with
[1:05:36] the problem
[1:05:38] it's almost like the Bible says to wait
[1:05:40] upon the Lord
[1:05:42] right you it's not that complicated go
[1:05:46] forth in faith strike out and when you
[1:05:48] come to a problem that you just can't
[1:05:50] overcome
[1:05:51] call your commander and get some backup
[1:05:53] and he will show up it might be a while
[1:05:56] you're you might turn this into a Siege
[1:05:58] sieges can last years
[1:06:01] right and I mean that like sometimes you
[1:06:03] got a real spiritual problem maybe you
[1:06:04] have a chronic disease that will not go
[1:06:06] away and that might take some years of
[1:06:09] waiting
[1:06:12] which you don't give up don't just
[1:06:14] abandon the position
[1:06:15] right
[1:06:16] you you just hold your ground and you
[1:06:19] continue to confess you continue to
[1:06:22] confess your testimony that of healing
[1:06:25] and it'll happen right
[1:06:29] and so I I wanted to take all of this
[1:06:32] and kind of if I could wrap it up and go
[1:06:35] in a little bit longer than what I had
[1:06:36] planned
[1:06:37] I want to hit one one final thing and
[1:06:40] kind of wrap it up on this
[1:06:43] and I want to think you know maybe apply
[1:06:45] this to a spiritual a real thing that I
[1:06:47] identify with a lot
[1:06:50] that would be Jonah
[1:06:53] because a lot of times you know we have
[1:06:55] all this idea we can think about oh
[1:06:56] we're going to plan and we're going to
[1:06:57] you know
[1:06:58] approach this problem this way and we
[1:07:00] got to plan to deal with it
[1:07:02] um Mike Tyson has a great line
[1:07:03] everyone's got a plan until they get
[1:07:04] punched in the face
[1:07:06] right and it's all fine well and good to
[1:07:08] have this plan oh we're going to
[1:07:09] organize ourselves in this way and we're
[1:07:10] going to approach this thing and yeah
[1:07:12] well okay and then Monday morning you
[1:07:13] get punched in the face
[1:07:15] right
[1:07:16] what is that and then you fall
[1:07:17] completely flat and then you're laying
[1:07:19] on your back going oh well that went
[1:07:21] horribly
[1:07:23] and you thought you did everything right
[1:07:24] and you're still wiped out
[1:07:28] and so now we want to get down into the
[1:07:29] down into the trench right what does it
[1:07:31] look like so I'll find well and good to
[1:07:32] think about what it looks like in the
[1:07:33] office tent what does it look like in
[1:07:34] the trench right because a lot of the
[1:07:37] times in the trench where things are
[1:07:38] really bad
[1:07:41] is when you're in a really ugly
[1:07:42] situation that you put yourself in
[1:07:46] right
[1:07:47] there's a um
[1:07:49] you know we talk about the
[1:07:52] the whole armor of God
[1:07:54] and it's you know beautiful and you
[1:07:56] obviously put on the whole number of God
[1:07:57] and it's
[1:07:59] but when you're assaulting gates in
[1:08:01] medieval times there's a nasty little
[1:08:02] trick they would do is dump boiling oil
[1:08:04] or water on the attackers because it
[1:08:06] goes down under your armor and Cooks you
[1:08:09] in your armor
[1:08:10] a lot of the times
[1:08:12] we have all your salvation got your
[1:08:14] righteousness your Shield of faith and
[1:08:16] your sword and your your helmeted truth
[1:08:18] and all this stuff and you assault that
[1:08:19] Gate of Hell and it just cooked you in
[1:08:21] your armor and you're sitting there
[1:08:23] laying on your back going well I thought
[1:08:25] I was righteous
[1:08:27] and there's that devil going oh wow what
[1:08:29] a what a good Christian you are
[1:08:31] you know just really grinding it in
[1:08:35] and that's where I feel like a lot of
[1:08:37] times we end up like Jonah because Jonah
[1:08:42] Jonah was a has a special kind of a
[1:08:45] story
[1:08:46] um
[1:08:47] in which
[1:08:49] um if you could go ahead and pull up
[1:08:51] Jonah chapter 2 verse 1.
[1:08:54] um because Jonah was told to do
[1:08:57] something and then he just didn't do it
[1:08:59] not only did he not do it he went and
[1:09:02] did the opposite
[1:09:04] and then he gets himself into a
[1:09:06] situation
[1:09:07] where he has completely rejected God and
[1:09:09] what God told him to do
[1:09:11] so badly that the Judgment of God is
[1:09:13] falling on him and not only falling on
[1:09:15] him but falling on a bunch of
[1:09:18] unaffiliated
[1:09:19] Sailors that had nothing to do with it
[1:09:21] and they're all going to die now because
[1:09:23] Jonah didn't want to do what God told
[1:09:25] him to do
[1:09:27] and so Jonah recognizes this and says
[1:09:30] well
[1:09:31] I can't let these innocent people die
[1:09:34] because of my stupidity
[1:09:36] so I'm going to give them the
[1:09:38] instructions on how to execute me
[1:09:41] it's not like Jonah knew there was going
[1:09:43] to be a fish
[1:09:44] right Jonah wasn't getting tell him to
[1:09:46] bind his hands and feet and throw him
[1:09:47] overboard because he was thinking oh
[1:09:49] well you know there's gonna be a fish
[1:09:50] down there and I'm going to wind up in
[1:09:51] Nineveh no Joe 's like no no they need
[1:09:54] to kill me
[1:09:55] kill me God can not kill them
[1:09:57] right Jonah's suicidal
[1:10:00] right Jonah is like I need to the the
[1:10:03] right thing for me to do right now is
[1:10:06] die
[1:10:07] right
[1:10:09] yeah and we get there I've been there
[1:10:13] you know the right thing to do this
[1:10:16] moment is die which is true you should
[1:10:18] be dying to yourself every day and the
[1:10:21] the reality and so they throw Joan
[1:10:22] overboard and then he you know goes down
[1:10:24] the water and they he's he's drowning in
[1:10:26] a great fish swallows him and then he
[1:10:28] finds himself
[1:10:30] in the belly of this fish and uh
[1:10:35] he's got this
[1:10:37] I mean you want to talk about a tough
[1:10:39] spot that he put himself in by the way I
[1:10:42] mean not only did he do all the
[1:10:43] circumstances that led up to him feeling
[1:10:44] like he needed to go in the water he
[1:10:45] then gave them the instructions to how
[1:10:46] to throw him there right he literally
[1:10:48] architected this whole thing
[1:10:51] so if you could pull up that uh I just
[1:10:53] want to I just want to read because now
[1:10:55] he's in there
[1:10:56] he's in the in the in the in the fish's
[1:10:58] belly and he prays this prayer
[1:11:01] it says then Jonah prayed unto the Lord
[1:11:03] his God out of the fish's belly
[1:11:06] and said I cried by reason of my
[1:11:08] Affliction unto the Lord and he heard me
[1:11:10] out of the belly of Hell cried I and
[1:11:13] thou hurtest my voice
[1:11:15] for thou has cast me into the deep in
[1:11:18] the midst of the Seas and the floods
[1:11:19] compassed me about all thy Billows and
[1:11:21] thy waves passed over me and then I said
[1:11:24] I am cast out of thy sight yet will I
[1:11:27] look again toward thy Holy Temple
[1:11:31] the waters can pass me about even this
[1:11:33] even to the soul the depth closed me
[1:11:36] round about the weeds were wrapped about
[1:11:38] my head I went down to the bottoms of
[1:11:41] the mountains the Earth with her bars
[1:11:43] was about me forever yet hast thou
[1:11:46] brought up my life from corruption O
[1:11:49] Lord my God
[1:11:51] when my soul fainted within me I
[1:11:54] remembered the Lord and my prayer came
[1:11:56] in unto thee into thine Holy Temple
[1:12:01] they that observe lying vanities forsake
[1:12:05] their own Mercy
[1:12:08] I will sacrifice unto thee with the
[1:12:11] voice of Thanksgiving I will pay that
[1:12:14] that I have vowed salvation is of the
[1:12:18] Lord
[1:12:20] and the Lord spake unto the fish and it
[1:12:22] vomited out Jonah upon the dry land
[1:12:28] the other day I read that that verse
[1:12:31] where it says
[1:12:33] um they that observe lying vanities
[1:12:35] reject their own Mercy
[1:12:39] and it so struck me because here's a man
[1:12:42] who
[1:12:43] I mean of all the audacity
[1:12:47] right the unmitigated goal
[1:12:50] of this man
[1:12:53] to literally throw himself in this
[1:12:55] situation
[1:12:56] be eaten by a fish
[1:12:59] be pitch black blind as a bat with
[1:13:01] seaweed wrapped around his head
[1:13:04] I don't know I don't imagine it's very
[1:13:05] roomy inside of a fish's belly either
[1:13:07] right it's kind of cramped
[1:13:09] and he's looking all around him
[1:13:12] feeling the crushing of the fish's
[1:13:14] stomach and going
[1:13:16] lying vanities
[1:13:19] lying vanities
[1:13:21] it's not real
[1:13:23] it's just fake
[1:13:26] what
[1:13:27] right and how many times do we get
[1:13:30] ourselves into a situation right it says
[1:13:32] that that he was in the belly of hell
[1:13:36] that we have so failed as Christians
[1:13:41] just completely
[1:13:43] just made a hash of it
[1:13:47] and so badly that hell has manifested
[1:13:51] around us
[1:13:52] do exactly what we know is wrong do
[1:13:55] exactly what we knew God told us not to
[1:13:57] do and now
[1:14:00] like Samson having gone and found a a
[1:14:04] Philistine Harlot has to use the gifts
[1:14:07] and the Deliverance of God to get
[1:14:08] himself out
[1:14:10] and here we are throw ourselves into the
[1:14:13] belly of hell and go
[1:14:16] you have the audacity to get yourself
[1:14:18] out
[1:14:20] right to pray is that really what you
[1:14:22] want to do you deserve that you deserve
[1:14:26] Deliverance after everything that you
[1:14:27] did
[1:14:28] answer is no you don't
[1:14:31] that's why it says they reject their own
[1:14:33] Mercy
[1:14:34] because Mercy isn't for people who
[1:14:36] deserve it
[1:14:39] right
[1:14:42] Mercy is when somebody can punish you
[1:14:44] and they choose not to
[1:14:46] Mercy is when you deserve everything
[1:14:48] that you're getting and the creator of
[1:14:50] the universe says no
[1:14:53] it's not going to go that way
[1:14:56] Mercy is for people who get themselves
[1:14:57] into an absolute meat grinder deserve
[1:15:01] every inch of it completely
[1:15:04] I get everything they got coming
[1:15:06] and delivered anyways
[1:15:09] because
[1:15:10] they looked at that situation and said
[1:15:12] you know
[1:15:14] it's not about me it's about the fact
[1:15:17] that the word of God says something the
[1:15:19] word of God says he's my deliverer and
[1:15:21] he doesn't say exactly what he's
[1:15:22] delivering me from the reality is he
[1:15:24] could have been delivering you from
[1:15:25] yourself as much as anything else
[1:15:27] right it doesn't say what you're
[1:15:29] supposed to be delivered from or what
[1:15:31] the judgment is it just says that if you
[1:15:33] reject those lying vanities and say no
[1:15:35] God said I could be an overcomer the
[1:15:38] word says I'm an overcomer and even
[1:15:40] though my actions might be the lying
[1:15:42] vanities that I am rejecting they're
[1:15:44] still lying vanities I'm going to reject
[1:15:46] them right these Temptations in my life
[1:15:49] these things that seem to oppress me
[1:15:51] that I can't get away from this this
[1:15:53] addiction that I fostered that I partook
[1:15:57] in
[1:15:58] that's a lying vanity and I'm rejecting
[1:16:00] it and no matter hey and when he said
[1:16:02] this the the fish's belly didn't just
[1:16:04] poof disappear
[1:16:05] he was in it for a while still right it
[1:16:08] didn't just
[1:16:09] go away
[1:16:11] you know and ultimately
[1:16:15] all of this is is coming down
[1:16:19] we can stand to our feet
[1:16:21] musicians come
[1:16:23] ultimately
[1:16:28] this is a type
[1:16:29] it's all the type the story of Joan is a
[1:16:32] type going down into the fish's belly is
[1:16:33] a type
[1:16:34] Christ going down in the belly of hell
[1:16:37] right
[1:16:39] it's not gonna
[1:16:40] and you think you know the the Bible
[1:16:43] says that that Jesus had to learn
[1:16:45] obedience through the things that he
[1:16:46] suffered
[1:16:47] that's an interesting thought that
[1:16:49] here's Jesus
[1:16:51] you think he you know he's perfect never
[1:16:53] failed and yet he still had to learn
[1:16:56] right didn't didn't
[1:16:59] um just uh whatever comes to your heart
[1:17:03] um
[1:17:05] and so ultimately
[1:17:07] you know when he when he's when he's
[1:17:09] down going down into hell he has to hold
[1:17:12] on to the promise the only reason why
[1:17:14] Christ came back and resurrected is
[1:17:16] because he had to hold on to the promise
[1:17:20] there was going to be another
[1:17:21] Resurrection there was going to be a
[1:17:23] resurrection the Bible said that he
[1:17:24] wouldn't leave his soul in hell
[1:17:26] and so he had to go to hell stand there
[1:17:29] and look Satan in the eye surrounded by
[1:17:31] billions of devils screaming in his face
[1:17:34] and say lying vanities
[1:17:37] and Christ had to go to hell believing
[1:17:39] his own word that he'd come back out
[1:17:41] because if he didn't he wouldn't have
[1:17:44] just all there is to it
[1:17:46] right it was and so we because that's
[1:17:49] our example we we allow these things
[1:17:52] into our lives
[1:17:54] but the reality is
[1:17:55] if Christ had to be learned to be
[1:17:57] subject to the word then we have to
[1:17:58] learn to be subject to the word we have
[1:18:00] to learn that you know it's not about me
[1:18:02] and my failures I'm still going to
[1:18:04] subject
[1:18:05] what I confess to the word
[1:18:08] even though I don't deserve it
[1:18:11] and that's
[1:18:13] um
[1:18:15] that's that's the battle I wanna I wanna
[1:18:17] read a quote just leave you with this
[1:18:19] you know I've gone over I apologize
[1:18:23] um went a little longer than I intended
[1:18:27] there's a quote from the greatest battle
[1:18:29] ever fought it's one of my all-time
[1:18:30] favorite things I've ever read
[1:18:33] [Music]
[1:18:34] um
[1:18:35] says
[1:18:37] if you come and you keep their memories
[1:18:40] and conscience and everything thinking
[1:18:42] about well I might fail I might not be
[1:18:46] right
[1:18:47] don't you do that at all
[1:18:49] you throw aside everything and open up
[1:18:52] the channel and say God your word is
[1:18:55] eternally true and it's for me if the
[1:18:58] whole church fails if the whole world
[1:19:00] fails yet I can't fail because I'm
[1:19:03] taking your word
[1:19:05] and so whatever need you have in your
[1:19:07] life whether it's overcoming whether it
[1:19:09] is just just having that closer walk
[1:19:11] with God whatever that is you say the
[1:19:15] promise is there for me God made the
[1:19:17] promise and his word can't fail and if
[1:19:19] everything else falls apart even if I
[1:19:21] fall apart tomorrow that doesn't matter
[1:19:24] that's a lying vanity and I claim the
[1:19:26] promise and to the day after tomorrow
[1:19:29] will be another day
[1:19:31] another day to to to carry on so thank
[1:19:35] you all for for listening and uh we'll

[1:25:39] blood flows and and atones for any uh
[1:25:44] any any illness or or ill effect father
[1:25:48] and this this woman father who who uh uh
[1:25:52] had her son with a bicycle accident
[1:25:55] Lord we ask that your your healing Grace
[1:25:58] would go forward that would atone in
[1:26:00] this case father that that perhaps the
[1:26:04] healing in this poor man's body might
[1:26:07] open a door the healing for his soul the
[1:26:10] greater healing might take place father
[1:26:12] for the Lord you know that this healing
[1:26:15] in his body may be temporary
[1:26:19] he he may die in yet still
[1:26:22] but that if that healing in his soul
[1:26:25] could go forward father that would be
[1:26:26] the greater healing for it would heal
[1:26:28] him for all eternity that it would be an
[1:26:30] eternal life father so that's what we

[1:26:56] any anxiety associated with that as
[1:26:59] nothing but anointment of the devil
[1:27:01] and we pray for deliverance and healing
[1:27:04] in this situation that all those who
[1:27:06] would be affected would not be would
[1:27:08] would be healed and that anyone exposed
[1:27:11] would not have fear of of of infection
