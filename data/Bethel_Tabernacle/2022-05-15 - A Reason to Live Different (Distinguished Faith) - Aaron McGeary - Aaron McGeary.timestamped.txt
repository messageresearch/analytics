[23:18] all once again. I'm just so encouraged
[23:20] to see all the youth. I see some new
[23:22] faces, but also see many that I saw at
[23:25] the last time we were here. Feels like
[23:27] just a month ago that we were here uh at
[23:30] the last service with brother John
[23:32] Andes. and we're just thankful to hear
[23:35] brother Aaron. Um, and we just uh just
[23:40] been so blessed by all the singing and
[23:42] the ministering of the word. So, I pray
[23:45] this song is a blessing to you. It's
[23:46] helped me many times through the years.
[23:50] [Music]
[23:58] So many times I've questioned
[24:02] the certain circumstances
[24:05] of things I could not understand.
[24:12] And many times in trials
[24:16] my weakness blurs my vision
[24:19] and my frustration gets so out of hand.
[24:26] But it's then I am reminded
[24:30] I've never been forsaken and I've never
[24:33] had to stand one test alone. Oh no. I
[24:40] look at all the victories. Then the
[24:43] spirit rises up in me. Cuz it's through
[24:47] the fire my weakness is made strong.
[24:51] Oh,
[24:53] he never promised that the cross would
[24:57] not get heavy or the hill would not be
[25:01] hard to climb.
[25:05] Oh no, he never offered high victories
[25:11] without fighting. But he said a help
[25:13] would always come in time.
[25:18] So just remember when you're standing in
[25:23] that valley of decision
[25:26] and the adversary say yes give in.
[25:31] Just hold on.
[25:35] Our Lord will show. Yes. And he will
[25:39] take you through the fire again.
[25:44] Listen now.
[25:47] I know within myself
[25:50] I would surely perish. Oh, but if I
[25:53] trust the hand of my God, he'll shield
[25:57] those flames again.
[26:00] [Music]
[26:01] Again.
[26:03] Wo.

[26:11] for the human beard to climb.
[26:18] He never offered or victories without
[26:23] fighting. But he said help would always
[26:26] come in town.
[26:30] Yes. when you're
[26:33] oh in that valley of decision and the
[26:38] adversary
[26:39] says
[26:41] give in just hold on
[26:46] our Lord will show yes and he will take
[26:51] you through the fire again.
[26:56] So just hold
[26:58] on.
[27:00] Our Lord will show. Oh, and he will take
[27:04] you through the fire again.
[27:09] Yes, he will again.

[36:53] The more that I can humble myself,
[36:59] the more he lifts me up. And every day I
[37:05] live.
[37:07] Lord, I love you more. Let's get the
[37:10] Lord a way offering.
[37:13] And it gets easier
[37:16] to understand
[37:19] the road I'm traveling down.
[37:24] No more wondering
[37:27] or wavering.
[37:29] I'm standing on solid ground.
[37:34] Now I know I'm headed to my future home.
[37:39] The voice I hear is yours alone. Every
[37:44] day I live.
[37:47] Lord, I love you more.
[37:52] more that I surrender,
[37:57] Lord, the light of my load,
[38:02] more that I release my cares,
[38:07] the more you take control,
[38:11] the more that I humble myself.
[38:17] Lord, the more you lift me up,
[38:21] say in every day I live, Lord, I love
[38:28] you more.
[38:31] [Music]
[38:33] The problems I had on yesterday
[38:37] are mere stepping stones to a higher
[38:41] place. the trials that seem so awesome
[38:46] to me. And now my battle of victory.
[38:51] Now I know I'm headed to my home. Voice
[38:57] I hear is yours alone. Every day I live.
[39:04] Lord, I love you more.
[39:08] The more that I surrender,
[39:12] Lord, the light of my Lord,
[39:17] the more that I release my cares.
[39:21] [Applause]
[39:23] The more you take control,
[39:27] the more that I humble myself,
[39:30] [Music]
[39:33] Lord, the more you take me.
[39:37] day and every day I live. Lord I love
[39:44] [Music]
[39:46] that I surrender
[39:52] the light of my Lord.
[39:55] Come on now. I release my

[40:04] [Music]
[40:09] Yes, Lord.
[40:12] You lift me up and every day I

[40:27] Hallelujah.
[40:36] Wow. Wow. Wow. Somebody say it
[40:38] backwards. Amen.
[40:42] My, what a wonderful Sunday morning.
[40:44] What a wonderful time that we've had.
[40:47] It's just been splendid all the way
[40:49] around. The Lord has blessed
[40:51] magnificently.
[40:53] Every time I'm coming to the service,
[40:55] I'm praying, "All right, Lord, that was
[40:57] great, but I'm expecting even more."
[41:00] Amen. And how many are ready for the
[41:01] conclusion of the matter today?
[41:03] I thought last night was such profound
[41:05] material.
[41:07] So valuable, friends. You take that and
[41:10] you you leave take all of the material
[41:12] you're hearing and take it home with
[41:14] you. Ponder it. Think about it because
[41:17] I'm telling you, there's life in it.
[41:18] Brother Brandon one time puts his chair,
[41:20] his Bible on a chair and he starts
[41:22] walking around it. Tells us on tape. And
[41:24] he said, "As I was walking around, that
[41:26] Bible just sitting there open." He said,
[41:27] "I thought to myself, oh there." And he
[41:30] points and he said, "There's life in
[41:32] there." Oh, just get people to believe
[41:35] it. Just receive it. How many receive it
[41:37] today? Say, "His words are life to me."
[41:42] Hallelujah. Brother Jack, they let you
[41:44] in here with these teenagers. Praise the
[41:45] Lord.
[41:47] Y'all going to have to amen loud to keep
[41:49] up ahead of that fella. Amen. Praise the
[41:52] Lord. Amen. And so we're happy to have

[42:08] aren't you glad for a world where
[42:10] nothing will be over? Oh my, I won't

[44:12] I am so ready. Happy to have all the
[44:15] visitors. If I'd start naming even one
[44:17] name, I'd forget half of them. And I'm
[44:20] bad for that. My church laughs at me
[44:21] because I can have somebody right here
[44:23] looking at me. I'll go, "Where's so and
[44:24] so?" They're looking right at me. Amen.
[44:27] But we love the Lord. I appreciate all
[44:29] of the singing, all of the wonderful

[44:43] truth.
[44:44] Amen.
[44:44] And so we want the spirit to anoint the
[44:47] word and anoint your hearts. How many

[46:21] Lord, I love you more.
[46:27] Amen. Praise the Lord.
[46:29] Amen. So happy to be together again this
[46:31] morning. It's been a wonderful privilege
[46:33] to be with you the last uh two nights
[46:35] and just a precious time together in
[46:38] fellowship with one another and then
[46:40] around the word. I trust you've really
[46:41] enjoyed yourself. You know, there's a
[46:43] lot of sacrifice that goes into uh
[46:45] meetings like this. You may think, oh,
[46:47] it's not a camp, but there's many times
[46:49] just as much preparation as you're not
[46:52] relying upon somebody else's facilities.
[46:54] And uh so there's just a lot of efforts
[46:56] that been put into this. And so we echo
[46:58] the sentiments of brother Jason and
[47:00] thanking all the teams and the support
[47:02] and the families that have opened up
[47:04] their homes to host visitors and you all
[47:07] the meal preparation, everything that's
[47:08] gone into this weekend. And a special
[47:10] thank you to brother Matthew and brother
[47:11] Jason Demars for the burden they carry
[47:14] and the labor they put in to see
[47:15] something like this happen. It's you
[47:17] don't notice it because they do it so
[47:19] well. And it's not until maybe
[47:21] something's not done right that we
[47:22] notice. But we just really want to
[47:24] express uh together with what brother
[47:25] Jason said, our personal gratitude uh
[47:28] for all that they've done. And we're
[47:30] grateful for the invitation that we had
[47:32] to be here. I believe it was brother
[47:34] Jason Demar that reached out to me and
[47:37] asked if we would come and speak uh this
[47:39] youth weekend. And since we had started
[47:41] a church in Phoenix, uh we've been
[47:43] saying no. We've been doing really
[47:45] really good at saying no. We've said no
[47:46] to them all. And but there was something
[47:48] about that this invitation that caught
[47:50] me off guard and because it was for
[47:53] young people um that was why I offered
[47:56] to pray about it and so I said I'll pray
[47:58] about it and then I just kept putting it
[47:59] off and putting it off and he gave me
[48:02] like a drop dead date like if you don't
[48:03] let me know by the end of the year we're
[48:05] moving on. So they they asked me last
[48:07] year to do this and uh it was that first
[48:10] beginning of the year that we just said
[48:11] yes, we'll come and it was immediately
[48:13] after I said yes, the Lord just put my
[48:15] put it in my heart what we're preaching
[48:16] this weekend and uh and so we're just
[48:20] grateful for that invitation. It's meant
[48:21] a lot to me and my family. And so we
[48:23] bring greetings to you from Arizona
[48:25] Believers Church in Phoenix, Arizona uh
[48:28] in September of 2020. We moved there the
[48:30] first week of September and held our
[48:31] first service. Um and uh we've been
[48:35] having full-time services there ever
[48:36] since then. And so we bring greetings to
[48:38] you from the believers there at Arizona
[48:40] Believers Church. There's many that you
[48:41] know uh that were at one time part of
[48:43] this fellowship here. The Alderson send
[48:45] their greetings. The Schuades, Sister
[48:47] Nicole Jackson, Brother John Failen
[48:49] specifically text me this weekend,
[48:50] please say hi to everybody for me. Uh,
[48:53] so I feel like we're family and um, if
[48:55] there's a sister church, I know that we
[48:57] have this real close relationship with
[48:59] your pastor and uh, him and his wife,
[49:01] Sister Debbie, have me a lot to
[49:02] Elizabeth and I. And so we just feel at
[49:05] home this morning. So glad that you're
[49:07] uh, we had this opportunity. And we have
[49:10] six of our own young people from our
[49:11] church here participating as uh, youth,
[49:14] senior youth. And so there's six of them
[49:16] that are here. Uh, and there's also, I
[49:19] think, 11 of us um, from Arizona
[49:21] Believers Church here. So, I don't know
[49:22] if we traveled the furthest to be here.
[49:25] Um, but we're all here. If you're from
[49:26] Arizona Believers Church, raise your
[49:28] hand. Get it up high. Preston, you might
[49:29] have to reach it up. So, we got I think
[49:32] I I think I've gained some converts cuz
[49:34] I've seen some faces I don't recognize
[49:36] raising. God bless you. Thank you so
[49:37] much for raising your hands and for
[49:40] choosing to be a part of our assembly in
[49:41] Phoenix. Got some new hands up.
[49:48] Amen. If you could turn in your Bibles
[49:51] to Exodus chapter 11.
[49:53] [Music]
[49:56] Exodus chapter 11
[49:59] uh verse 1
[50:02] and read to verse 7.
[50:11] I'll just begin reading Exodus 11 verse
[50:15] one. Read verse 7. And the Lord said
[50:16] unto Moses, "Yet will I bring one plague
[50:19] more upon Pharaoh and upon Egypt.
[50:21] Afterwards he will let you go hence.
[50:24] When he shall let you go, he shall
[50:26] surely thrust you out hence altogether.
[50:29] Speak now in the ears of the people, and
[50:30] let every man borrow of his neighbor,
[50:32] and every woman of her neighbor, jewels
[50:34] of silver and jewels of gold." And the
[50:37] Lord gave the people favor in the sight
[50:39] of Egyptians. Moreover, the man Moses
[50:41] was very great in the land of Egypt, in
[50:42] the sight of Pharaoh's servants, and in
[50:44] the sight of the people. And Moses said,
[50:46] "Thus sayeth the Lord, about midnight I
[50:48] will go out into the midst of, and all
[50:51] the firstborn in the land of Egypt shall
[50:53] die, from the firstborn of Pharaoh that
[50:54] siteth upon his throne, even under the
[50:56] firstborn of the maid servant that is
[50:58] behind the mill, and all the firstborn
[51:00] of beast. And there shall be great a
[51:03] great cry throughout all the land of
[51:05] Egypt, such as there was none like it,
[51:06] nor shall be like it anymore. But
[51:09] against any of the children of Israel
[51:12] shall not a dog move his tongue against
[51:15] man or beast, that ye may know how that
[51:18] the Lord doth put a difference between
[51:21] the Egyptians and Israel. Isn't that a
[51:23] remarkable sentence?
[51:24] But against any of the children of
[51:26] Israel shall not a dog move his tongue
[51:27] against man or beast, that ye may know
[51:30] how that the Lord doth put a difference
[51:32] between the Egyptians and Israel. Let's
[51:35] pray. Our gracious heavenly father,
[51:38] we just commit this time to you now,
[51:40] Lord, in the middle of the day after the
[51:43] a long weekend. I just trust that
[51:46] there's a readiness of mind to receive
[51:48] yet again from you. And Lord, I just
[51:51] purpose to follow in your way and to
[51:55] share the things that would be pertinent
[51:57] today. I commit myself to you, Lord. I
[51:59] know I have a lot of things maybe before
[52:01] me that are quickened and and inspired
[52:03] to me. But even now, Lord, I believe
[52:04] that you could just uh uh focus it even
[52:07] more, narrow it just so that it could
[52:09] hit the mark, Lord, and we could just
[52:10] leave it where you would want it to be.
[52:12] So, we commit all things to you now,
[52:13] Lord, in the name of the Lord Jesus
[52:14] Christ. Amen. Amen. You can be seated.
[52:20] In case I forget, I do want to just say
[52:22] to the young people how much I
[52:25] appreciate your attentiveness and the
[52:27] pull that you have put on the word of
[52:29] God and just the blessing it is to the
[52:31] minister to experience that. And I
[52:34] expressed it last night and I do want to
[52:36] repeat it that I do sincerely love each
[52:38] one of you and have a great desire to
[52:41] help. If there's any way that we could
[52:43] ever be of help to you or service to
[52:44] you, just let us know. We've been
[52:47] reading from 1 Peter chapter 3:15. I
[52:50] think we did it Friday night, last
[52:51] night. But it says, "But sanctify the
[52:52] Lord God in your hearts and be ready
[52:54] always to give an answer to every man
[52:57] that askketh you a reason of the hope
[52:59] that is in you with meekness and fear."
[53:02] And so you're asked to give a reason or
[53:04] motivation of your hope or your purpose.
[53:06] So there's your reason and purpose kind
[53:08] of coming together, motive and
[53:10] objective. And an answer is a reasoned
[53:12] statement. As brother said, come with
[53:13] all the intelligence you've got. There's
[53:15] a a thought process. It's a
[53:16] contemplation. You you have an
[53:18] understanding. You have a reason. It's
[53:20] not just letting your mind go blank. And
[53:22] so you have a the question I even was
[53:25] pondering it this way of the reason that
[53:28] askketh you give an answer to every man
[53:30] that ask you a reason of the hope. What
[53:31] is what is your motivation for your
[53:33] objective? And so we have to have an
[53:36] answer to this. And so it it speaks to
[53:39] me to say that we must in our own lives
[53:41] have motive and objective. We must have
[53:44] reason and purpose. And this mirrors and
[53:47] matches uh God's nature as brother Bram
[53:49] said, God being a savior. It was
[53:52] necessary that he predestinated a man
[53:54] who would require salvation in order to
[53:56] give himself reason and purpose of
[53:58] being. So God even himself wants has a
[54:02] reason and purpose. He has a motivation
[54:04] and an objective. He has a something
[54:06] he's trying to accomplish. And so we
[54:08] mirror God in that sense that God has to
[54:11] have a reason to live. God has a reason
[54:13] to exist and likewise we will never
[54:16] truly achieve satisfaction or happiness
[54:19] until likewise we find our purpose and
[54:22] our reason in him.
[54:24] Reason is a motive or a cause for acting
[54:26] or thinking in a particular way. We may
[54:28] call it a motivation or our motive
[54:31] purpose is an object to be reached an
[54:33] intended result. So there's where motive
[54:35] and objective are coming together and we
[54:37] recognize brother Brandham emphasizes
[54:39] that quite often and how important it
[54:40] is. So God himself had reason and
[54:43] purpose of being, a reason to live, a
[54:46] reason to exist. And one thing that we
[54:49] hope that we have touched on and it's
[54:51] it's in your minds is how that Satan and
[54:54] society try to rob us of our sense of
[54:57] purpose, tries to take away from us, our
[55:00] rationale, our reasoning, our
[55:02] conviction, our contemplation, our
[55:04] emphasis on things that are important.
[55:06] And so we we kind of Friday night was a
[55:09] reason and it was dot dot dot and it was
[55:11] that way for a purpose just to kind of
[55:13] hold you that suspense. Then last night
[55:15] it was a reason to live. And so that was
[55:18] uh what we focused on. And it's the
[55:19] word, a reason to live. We're going to
[55:21] find that in the word. It's the word
[55:23] that's going to resolve your anxieties.
[55:25] Amen.
[55:25] There's a lot of things out there we may
[55:27] try to pursue to make sense of things,
[55:28] but at the end of the day, it's only
[55:30] going to be Christ that's going to
[55:31] resolve these anxieties.
[55:32] Amen. And we used a statement, brother
[55:34] Brandham in the church age book said,
[55:36] "We got to follow the leader of the li
[55:38] life. There's only one thing that's
[55:39] necessary and and flee to Christ and
[55:41] follow the leader of life." And he says,
[55:43] "We ought to take this Bible and cry, I
[55:45] believe what God has revealed in this
[55:47] book."
[55:48] Yes,
[55:48] I will obediently keep his commands. I
[55:51] hope for that which he has promised.
[55:53] Now, that's this is uh this could form
[55:55] the the backbone for a very lengthy
[55:57] series, right? Or at least a lengthy
[55:59] sermon if anybody's on board. But it
[56:02] this I believe what God has revealed in
[56:04] this book. That's a mouthful.
[56:05] And then I will obediently keep his
[56:07] commands. So there's this belief in what
[56:10] is written. It may it may almost in a
[56:12] sense be backwardlooking. Then I will
[56:14] obediently keep his commands. This is
[56:16] presently my my my conviction. But then
[56:18] I hope for that which he has promised.
[56:20] There's something forward-looking.
[56:22] I hope for that which is promised. And a
[56:24] hope is a in the Christian sense is a
[56:26] joyful and confident expectation. We're
[56:28] not talking about a hope so that is a
[56:30] carnal hope that is an enemy to faith,
[56:32] but a scriptural hope that is actually
[56:34] translated to faith in the Bible that
[56:36] there in one instance that this is a
[56:37] joyful and confident expectation. And so
[56:41] my sermon to this um wait hold on. My
[56:43] sermon this afternoon, it's 12:01. My
[56:46] sermon this afternoon, you blame that on
[56:48] the song service because I'm just now
[56:50] looking at my watch. We're just now
[56:51] starting at 12:01. And and my title
[56:55] today is a reason to live different.
[56:58] Amen.
[56:59] Amen.
[57:00] And my subtitle is distinguished faith.
[57:03] A reason to live different.
[57:05] Distinguished faith. Now, if I could
[57:08] speak maybe very relevantly to the young
[57:10] people uh about kind of what the and
[57:13] this may be more relevant to youth camps
[57:15] and when we go away and we have youth
[57:16] camps, we spend maybe a little bit
[57:18] longer time and have more services and
[57:19] it feels less like home meetings. But
[57:22] one of the most common outcomes or the
[57:23] most common products of youth meetings
[57:26] are youthful promises.
[57:29] We have uh Thank you parents. I
[57:31] appreciate that. We have youth meetings
[57:33] and the the most uh common maybe thing
[57:36] that is takes place afterwards is young
[57:38] people making promises and resolving
[57:40] certain things and and this is not a bad
[57:42] thing at all, but this is just in the
[57:44] enthusiasm of the weekend in the the
[57:47] cleanness that you feel as you've been
[57:48] washed from influences and you get
[57:50] around a different atmosphere and it
[57:52] starts bringing some clarity of mind.
[57:54] Yeah,
[57:54] you get away from school. You get away
[57:56] from work. You get away from worldly
[57:57] influences. You get away from your
[57:58] devices and the things that you can
[58:00] binge on, the things that you watch, and
[58:01] it kind of sanctifies your spirit. And
[58:03] all a sudden, this real desire for God,
[58:06] it starts to get freed up a little bit.
[58:08] You start thinking, "Yeah, this is this
[58:09] is right. This is the way that I want to
[58:10] live. And I I want to I want to make
[58:12] some changes when I get home." And so,
[58:14] what happens is we start to make many
[58:16] different resolutions about what we're
[58:18] going to do when we get back home, we
[58:20] get back to normal life. And it's I'm
[58:22] going to to do this and I'm going to do
[58:24] that and I'm going to take care of this
[58:25] and I'm going to take care of that. I'm
[58:26] going to stop doing this. I'm going to
[58:28] stop doing that. We got all sorts of
[58:29] plans as to how things are going to
[58:30] change and and I would say that there's
[58:33] no disparaging that making promises is
[58:35] not a bad thing. It's not wrong. But
[58:37] let's come back to the uh the point of
[58:40] this weekend is what's my reason?
[58:41] All right.
[58:42] What's my purpose? Because my motive and
[58:45] objective must be right. If I I may say
[58:47] I'm wanting to do this and my objective
[58:49] may be right, but the motive's not
[58:50] right. if the motivation is not right
[58:52] and brother says it's not going to work
[58:54] and that might seem awkward in the sense
[58:56] that well how can I be wrong to want to
[58:58] go clean my life up but I'll say this if
[59:00] you know that you ought to be doing
[59:02] something and you're just going to use
[59:03] your own mental fortitude and your own
[59:05] mental discipline and your own fleshly
[59:08] desire to somehow go and fulfill that
[59:10] you might be leaving out a very critical
[59:12] component to overcoming in this last age
[59:14] and it's that without him we are nothing
[59:19] amen sir And so our purpose then must be
[59:22] according to the word. We must have word
[59:24] desires when we go word objectives. Our
[59:26] objective must be according to the word.
[59:28] But then also our reason or our
[59:30] motivation must be by the word.
[59:32] Bible tells us both him in us to will
[59:35] and to do of his good pleasure. So we
[59:37] want it to be Christ in us willing to do
[59:39] the right thing but then also doing the
[59:42] right thing. So our motivation comes
[59:44] from the word. In Colossians 3 1 and2 it
[59:46] says if you then be risen with Christ
[59:48] seek those things which are above where
[59:51] Christ siteth on the right hand of God.
[59:52] So we are to seek those things which are
[59:54] above. That bringing that dichotomy
[59:56] between earthly things, fleshly things,
[59:58] carnal things and things that are
[1:00:00] spiritual. So we seek spiritual things.
[1:00:03] And he says verse two, set your
[1:00:05] affection on things above, not on things
[1:00:08] on the earth. to set your affection, to
[1:00:11] direct your mind on a thing, to seek
[1:00:14] those things which are before. You're
[1:00:15] going to seek after, you're going to
[1:00:16] strive for. This is something that's
[1:00:17] purposed in your heart. And I'm I'm
[1:00:19] speaking on this a reason to live
[1:00:21] different uh this morning and and
[1:00:23] wanting to use something that I could
[1:00:24] just uh emphasize to you that your faith
[1:00:27] can reach out and grab and say, I'm
[1:00:28] going to this is going to become my
[1:00:30] objective. I'm going to be seeking the
[1:00:32] right things. There's a lot of natural
[1:00:33] things that I got to take care of.
[1:00:35] There's a lot of natural things I got to
[1:00:36] do. I got to go to school. I maybe got
[1:00:37] need to get a job. I need to take care
[1:00:39] of this and take care of that. And
[1:00:40] you're going to have to do all those.
[1:00:41] But beyond that, there should be
[1:00:43] something that you're striving for,
[1:00:45] something that puts everything in
[1:00:46] perspective, something that motivates
[1:00:48] you. So, we want to set even this
[1:00:50] morning, I want to challenge you to take
[1:00:52] your affections, your ambitions, and
[1:00:54] your desires, and your wants, and set
[1:00:56] them on things above. Amen.
[1:01:00] Brother Van in the sermon thinking on
[1:01:02] our way and he's and he's asking
[1:01:04] somebody about kind of in a counseling
[1:01:07] he says I said when did that you start
[1:01:08] this he said about 20 years ago. I said
[1:01:11] where are you going? He said nowhere. I
[1:01:14] said then where did you come from? He
[1:01:15] said nowhere. I said how long do you
[1:01:17] expect to keep this up? He said oh I
[1:01:19] don't know what a conversation
[1:01:23] you know where are you going? Nowhere.
[1:01:25] And if you and if you don't know where
[1:01:26] you're going, any road will get you
[1:01:28] there.
[1:01:29] And he says, "Then where'd you come
[1:01:30] from?" "Nohere. How do you long how long
[1:01:32] do you expect to keep this up?" "Oh, I
[1:01:33] don't know." And brother says, "No
[1:01:34] ambitions."
[1:01:37] Why? And he and this is the part I I
[1:01:38] want you to catch here. He says, "Why
[1:01:40] the Christian ought to be the most
[1:01:41] ambitious person in the world."
[1:01:45] I think there may be a way that we could
[1:01:47] preach the the word, and it almost kind
[1:01:49] of beats us down to where we feel like
[1:01:50] we don't we shouldn't have any ambition.
[1:01:52] We shouldn't desire to achieve. And
[1:01:53] that's certainly not correct. He says
[1:01:55] Christians ought to be the most
[1:01:56] ambitious. A Christian ought to be the
[1:01:58] most ambitious person in the world.
[1:02:01] He says bring this glorious gospel of
[1:02:03] eternal life to a dying and perishing
[1:02:05] world. We should be up and at it right
[1:02:08] now.
[1:02:08] That's what we should be. We should be
[1:02:10] up and at it. We should be up and doing.
[1:02:12] And so our ambition isn't to figure out
[1:02:14] some way where we can all end up in
[1:02:15] Jackson, Wyoming on a in a ranch as a
[1:02:18] cult and isolating ourselves, but we
[1:02:20] know we all have and it would be a nice
[1:02:22] place to be, but uh but we all have
[1:02:24] obligations and responsibilities in this
[1:02:26] life. We have callings, we have uh
[1:02:28] occupations, we have education, we have
[1:02:30] extended family relationships, and God
[1:02:33] wants all of those to see the Christ
[1:02:36] that's in you. So, it's not a matter of
[1:02:38] withdrawing ourselves and becoming
[1:02:40] insular, but it's a matter of finding
[1:02:42] some bedrock, finding a face-to-face
[1:02:44] meeting with Christ and not being afraid
[1:02:46] to return back to the places we
[1:02:48] associate, not being afraid to go back
[1:02:50] to work, back to school, back among the
[1:02:52] people in our neighborhood and stand for
[1:02:54] the things of the gospel and be up and
[1:02:56] at the things of Christ.
[1:02:59] Brother Brandon in the sermon as the
[1:03:00] eagle stirs her nest. He said that's the
[1:03:02] way God builds his church for his
[1:03:03] eagllets. High above the ambitions of
[1:03:06] this world, she's got a high ambition
[1:03:09] not to please men, but to please God,
[1:03:11] she's built high and safe.
[1:03:13] Amen.
[1:03:14] High ambitions are safety. If you can
[1:03:16] seek those things which are above and
[1:03:18] set your affections on things above and
[1:03:22] not on the earth, that there's a safety
[1:03:24] in that. If I'm aiming for those things,
[1:03:27] if my objective is those things, he
[1:03:29] said, "This is a high ambition to please
[1:03:31] God, that's it's part of your being
[1:03:33] built high and safe." So, as you leave,
[1:03:37] going back and maybe so the the senior
[1:03:39] youth here and those here aren't
[1:03:40] necessarily leaving, but as we just
[1:03:41] return back uh to our regular lives,
[1:03:44] base your hope, as he says, I hope for
[1:03:46] that which he has promised. Based your
[1:03:48] hope and your expectation upon God's
[1:03:50] promise, not your own.
[1:03:51] Amen.
[1:03:53] Find something in the word of God. I'm
[1:03:54] going to set my affections on things
[1:03:55] above. Find something in the word of God
[1:03:57] to base your expectation upon. In Psalm
[1:04:00] 16:8-9, it says, "I have set the Lord
[1:04:02] always before me because he is at my
[1:04:05] right hand. I shall not be moved because
[1:04:07] he's at my right hand. Because he's by
[1:04:09] my side, because he's upholding me, I
[1:04:11] will not be moved." So, I've set the
[1:04:13] Lord always before me. You could do this
[1:04:15] in your heart. Lord, I don't even know
[1:04:16] what it looks like. I don't know what it
[1:04:17] means, but I want you to be before me. I
[1:04:19] want to be pursuing you. I I want I want
[1:04:21] to have you present in my life. I set
[1:04:23] the Lord always before me. Therefore, my
[1:04:25] heart is glad and my glory rejoiceth. My
[1:04:27] flesh also shall rest in hope.
[1:04:30] This is this is the the the the balm to
[1:04:33] a melancholy heart. This is the this is
[1:04:35] the the encouragement and the praise to
[1:04:37] somebody who's cast down. I'm going to
[1:04:39] put the Lord before me. He is my joy. He
[1:04:42] is my encouragement. He is my strength.
[1:04:45] And therefore, my heart will be glad. My
[1:04:46] glory will rejoice. And my flesh also
[1:04:49] shall rest in hope. It's eating soothes
[1:04:52] the spirit.
[1:04:53] Yeah.
[1:04:54] Setting the word before us. I'll set the
[1:04:56] Lord always before me. That's our goal.
[1:04:58] I'm looking to God to fulfill his word.
[1:04:59] This is this becomes part of my his
[1:05:01] promise becomes my purpose. And I can be
[1:05:04] confident in saying this and the Lord
[1:05:07] dealt with my heart maybe just through a
[1:05:08] number of uh uh years. Maybe it was part
[1:05:11] partly in ministry and just maturing and
[1:05:13] growing up a little bit that when I when
[1:05:15] I minister to young people, there's zero
[1:05:17] fear.
[1:05:19] I I'm not afraid that that you're going
[1:05:21] to fail. I'm not afraid that you're not
[1:05:22] going to get it. I'm not afraid uh that
[1:05:24] you know that so that somehow I got to
[1:05:26] get more aggressive in my tactic and I
[1:05:27] got to shake you and and scare you into
[1:05:30] something. And so if you if all of you
[1:05:32] testified this weekend and even at this
[1:05:35] very moment said, "Brother Aaron, I know
[1:05:36] you're preaching about the new birth,
[1:05:37] but none of us got it. We didn't really
[1:05:39] get it." I that wouldn't scare me one
[1:05:41] bit because I would just say, "Well,
[1:05:42] you're coming to it."
[1:05:44] And I did my part just to move you along
[1:05:46] and at least got you thinking about it
[1:05:47] and you you can tell me you don't have
[1:05:49] it. And I would say this that if you
[1:05:51] didn't get what you needed this weekend,
[1:05:53] and this is the point I want to make
[1:05:54] about my confidence. And then just keep
[1:05:56] seeking it because you're coming to it.
[1:05:58] Do not be discouraged whatsoever at all.
[1:06:01] If for some reason expectations weren't
[1:06:04] met or something didn't quite click,
[1:06:06] then you just purpose in your heart. I'm
[1:06:08] still coming to it. When I leave, I'm
[1:06:10] not going to look forward to the next
[1:06:12] youth camp. I'm going to look forward to
[1:06:14] Christ on Monday morning. I'm going to
[1:06:16] set the Lord always before me. I'm not
[1:06:18] worried about this camp or that camp or
[1:06:20] the next meeting. I need him before me
[1:06:22] right now. He's imminent. He's here. His
[1:06:25] promise is before me. And have this kind
[1:06:27] of confession. I may not have got what I
[1:06:29] needed, but I'm coming to what I need.
[1:06:31] I'm gonna get it. I'm going to receive
[1:06:33] it. And believe that
[1:06:36] 100%.
[1:06:37] As if anything, what you did this
[1:06:38] weekend is you declared yourself.
[1:06:41] And in doing so, when you declared
[1:06:43] yourself, you didn't that that that
[1:06:44] little baby laying there in the Nick ICU
[1:06:47] is completely unable to to say what it
[1:06:49] needs. It's not able to help itself. All
[1:06:52] it does is it does something that
[1:06:53] triggers the aid of heaven. does
[1:06:55] something to trigger the aid of those
[1:06:56] doctors and those nurses and everyone
[1:06:58] begins to give it what it needs. When
[1:07:00] you declared yourself last night, all of
[1:07:02] heaven has come to your rescue. And God
[1:07:05] is about you. He's near you. He's
[1:07:07] interested in you. And what you've done
[1:07:08] by declaring yourself is you've invited
[1:07:10] his help. So, you can leave with this
[1:07:12] confidence. Lord, I know that you're
[1:07:13] with me. I know you're walking beside
[1:07:15] me. And if I didn't get what I needed
[1:07:17] last night, then I'm still keeping my
[1:07:19] eyes on you and trusting you because I
[1:07:22] said help. And I know you're my help.
[1:07:24] Amen. Amen.
[1:07:25] Amen.
[1:07:27] In the message perseverant,
[1:07:30] brother Ram says, "Man of all ages that
[1:07:32] has had faith in what they're trying to
[1:07:34] achieve
[1:07:37] have been perseverant."
[1:07:39] No man can be perseverant unless first
[1:07:42] he knows what he's trying to achieve. So
[1:07:44] really, there's some tremendous
[1:07:45] components there that if you're going to
[1:07:47] achieve anything, you have to be
[1:07:48] persevering.
[1:07:50] But you can't be persevering until you
[1:07:51] know what you're trying to achieve.
[1:07:52] Right.
[1:07:53] That's right.
[1:07:54] We could drill in. You You got to be
[1:07:55] determined. You got to be purpose. You
[1:07:56] got to You got to be and you leave and
[1:07:58] go. I'm determined. I'm determined for
[1:08:00] what like I didn't we didn't we didn't
[1:08:02] talk about that,
[1:08:04] right?
[1:08:05] We didn't talk about what I should be be
[1:08:06] determined about. Well, you got you got
[1:08:08] to know what you're trying to achieve.
[1:08:09] This goes back to a reason. You got to
[1:08:11] have some faith has to have a reason. It
[1:08:13] has to have some reason.
[1:08:15] You can't just put your faith in a fence
[1:08:16] post.
[1:08:18] It's got to be it's got to be anchored
[1:08:20] in something. First, you must know what
[1:08:22] you're trying to achieve and then have
[1:08:23] faith that you're going to get what
[1:08:25] you're trying for. And that makes you
[1:08:27] persistent.
[1:08:28] Something that you know is real.
[1:08:32] He says faith is based that way.
[1:08:34] Faith is not based upon a myth and upon
[1:08:36] something that well just say go do this
[1:08:38] or do that on the words of some man. But
[1:08:41] faith takes its eternal resting place
[1:08:43] upon the word of the Lord, upon God's
[1:08:46] word which is the Bible. With this Bible
[1:08:48] in my hand, I believe what God has
[1:08:49] revealed in this book. I will obediently
[1:08:51] keep his commands and I hope for that
[1:08:53] which he has promised. But faith takes
[1:08:55] its eternal resting place upon the word
[1:08:57] of the Lord, upon God's word, which is
[1:08:58] the Bible. And I skipping a little bit
[1:09:01] here. He says nothing's going to stop a
[1:09:03] man when he's perseverant. When he knows
[1:09:05] what he is doing and got faith in what
[1:09:07] he's trying to achieve.
[1:09:08] Amen. Uh let there be some let your
[1:09:11] faith reach out upon some promise today
[1:09:13] that you can look to and say this is
[1:09:16] this is my deliberation. This is what
[1:09:18] I'm contemplating. This is what I'm
[1:09:19] coming to. This is what I'm putting my
[1:09:21] faith on. And I'm going to be
[1:09:22] perseverant to that.
[1:09:24] Yeah.
[1:09:25] I hope for that which he has promised.
[1:09:28] Now I want to u I hope that kind of can
[1:09:31] form some foundation there. I know it
[1:09:33] may be there's a lot there that would be
[1:09:35] worthy to expound upon
[1:09:38] and
[1:09:39] and and we'll just I hope that that can
[1:09:41] be uh
[1:09:43] concrete to you to now that you think
[1:09:45] that I I can make that relevant even if
[1:09:47] we just stopped maybe at this moment and
[1:09:49] uh and they were asking me I think the
[1:09:50] kids are asking me what we're having
[1:09:51] later and I just by faith claimed shrimp
[1:09:53] and grits. Is that by chance a
[1:09:55] possibility?
[1:09:57] I can make it happen.
[1:09:58] We can make it happen. I like to hear
[1:09:59] that. Can you get the old Mama Jeans
[1:10:01] recipe? Woo. That was a good shrimp and
[1:10:03] grizz. Where are we right now? Okay,
[1:10:05] great. Let's get back. I hope that
[1:10:06] that's something that that can be
[1:10:09] useful. Even if we just left it on that
[1:10:11] or even if we just kept mentioning that
[1:10:13] over and over again, it could be useful.
[1:10:15] But now I want to take a step further in
[1:10:17] this because I believe there's something
[1:10:19] that is very important for our our our
[1:10:22] paradigm and what we're how we view
[1:10:24] things. I hope for that which he has
[1:10:26] promised. We have to be we have to be
[1:10:30] oriented on the promise for our day.
[1:10:34] And the promised hope of this hour is a
[1:10:36] rapture.
[1:10:38] That that's the promised hope for this
[1:10:40] hour. So the rapture must be in view and
[1:10:44] it must become part of our objective.
[1:10:46] And if you look back even in Paul's day,
[1:10:48] and I think they're going to maybe be
[1:10:49] reading a statement I if I kept some of
[1:10:52] these scriptures in there, where Paul
[1:10:54] spoke as if these things and the
[1:10:56] believers spoke as if these things are
[1:10:57] very imminent. So this is part of the
[1:11:00] success of a Christian life is you're
[1:11:01] not just living for what's immediately
[1:11:03] in front of you, but you're living out
[1:11:05] into something that's in the future.
[1:11:07] Amen.
[1:11:07] Brother Bham tells the story about the
[1:11:09] young man who won the the I think it the
[1:11:12] in the contest. It was a Schwin bicycle
[1:11:14] contest and I had all these excellent
[1:11:16] riders that had these really, really
[1:11:17] good bikes and whoever got to the other
[1:11:19] side was going to win this big prize of
[1:11:20] a bike. And all these skilled riders
[1:11:22] tried to ride across this narrow thing
[1:11:24] without falling down. And they all fell
[1:11:26] down, but then just some kid with no
[1:11:28] skill and not even a good bike was able
[1:11:30] to get to the other side. And they all
[1:11:32] they asked him, "How in the world did
[1:11:33] you get to the other side?" He said, "I
[1:11:34] just set my eyes to the end and I just
[1:11:37] kept looking at the end and I held that
[1:11:39] steady." Amen.
[1:11:40] And that's what if and if I just got you
[1:11:43] thinking about tomorrow, if I just got
[1:11:45] you thinking about this afternoon, if I
[1:11:46] got you thinking about your the choice
[1:11:48] where you're going to go to college and
[1:11:50] where you might be get your degree in
[1:11:51] and who you're going to marry, there's
[1:11:53] more anxiety would be cropping up right
[1:11:55] now. A
[1:11:56] and we could say, "Whatever you do,
[1:11:57] don't get the wrong one. If you marry
[1:11:58] the wrong one, it's going to be hell on
[1:12:00] earth." And and whatever you do, don't
[1:12:01] make a mistake. And whatever you don't
[1:12:02] go to college where there's not a church
[1:12:03] and all you do is get more anxious, more
[1:12:05] anxious, more anxious, more anxious. I
[1:12:06] could talk to you about the future of
[1:12:07] this and the future of that. And there's
[1:12:09] going to come a day when all of us are
[1:12:10] going to be sitting in our rooms with VR
[1:12:12] headsets on and all the work's going to
[1:12:13] be done in India and you're going to be
[1:12:15] like what are we going to do? What are
[1:12:16] we what are we doing? Could talk about
[1:12:18] supply chain issues and everything else
[1:12:20] and all it would do is create anxiety.
[1:12:22] So a believer can't just think about
[1:12:24] this week, the next week and can't even
[1:12:26] think about the next month and the next
[1:12:28] year. We've got to have our eyes on the
[1:12:31] end.
[1:12:32] [Applause]
[1:12:33] Amen.
[1:12:34] Lord
[1:12:35] the word for today is not a word of
[1:12:37] reformation. Certainly not a word of uh
[1:12:40] um confirmation where we're just
[1:12:42] conforming ourselves to the image of the
[1:12:44] pastor, the image of the church, the
[1:12:45] image of the message. As a matter of
[1:12:47] fact, there's been too much culture
[1:12:48] building.
[1:12:50] That's good.
[1:12:51] But the message of this hour is for the
[1:12:53] purpose of translation.
[1:12:56] Amen. And if I could just share in my
[1:12:59] heart maybe kind of what was in the one
[1:13:01] thing I felt was going to be
[1:13:02] accomplished through these services and
[1:13:04] the way that the emphasis is there going
[1:13:06] to be a little bit of a reset of our
[1:13:07] focus
[1:13:09] that at the very least maybe something
[1:13:12] could happen just kind of checks you a
[1:13:13] little bit and you start thinking well
[1:13:14] all right I'm thinking about this a
[1:13:16] little bit differently now I I'm
[1:13:17] pondering these things and we start to
[1:13:19] recalibrate our motive we start to
[1:13:21] rethink what our objectives are we start
[1:13:24] asking ourselves do I have a re am I
[1:13:25] living with purpose am Am I living a
[1:13:27] meaningful life? Am I am I am I pursuing
[1:13:30] things that are that are real and going
[1:13:32] to have weight? Yes, sir.
[1:13:33] And so, we're wanting to look forward.
[1:13:35] Brother Bam says in the message,
[1:13:36] "Shalom, we're not we're not going to
[1:13:38] have a rearview mirror affair."
[1:13:40] A rearview mirror only looks back and
[1:13:42] sees where you have been.
[1:13:45] Young people, you're young, so you
[1:13:47] haven't lived a long life. Uh and and so
[1:13:50] maybe you don't have a lot of regrets
[1:13:52] and or maybe you don't have a lot of
[1:13:53] things you can brag about. Uh, and
[1:13:56] brother Tim Dodd was sharing a testimony
[1:13:58] how cute it is when his 2-year-old girl
[1:13:59] sings, "All my life you have been
[1:14:01] faithful." Just belts it out. It's like,
[1:14:03] "Yeah, okay. Even if it's just two
[1:14:05] years, he's been faithful." And and so
[1:14:08] that we can we can even now look back.
[1:14:11] We can look back with regret. We can
[1:14:12] look back with some sort of hope. You
[1:14:14] show me where I've done something good.
[1:14:15] Show me what has meaning. But we're not
[1:14:18] to look back. Even from this moment on,
[1:14:20] you should declare to yourself, your
[1:14:22] past does not define who you are. Your
[1:14:25] future defines who you are.
[1:14:28] We're the we're the only class of people
[1:14:30] where our future is a memory.
[1:14:33] Where where we're going and what we're
[1:14:35] headed to and what we have to look
[1:14:37] forward to is something is already set
[1:14:39] and established and permanent and real.
[1:14:41] And so it's our future that means more
[1:14:43] to us than our past.
[1:14:45] And we're looking forward, but it says
[1:14:47] we are looking forward to see where we
[1:14:48] are going.
[1:14:49] Don't look back, but look forward. Yes.
[1:14:52] Hallelujah.
[1:14:53] So this is my So then if this is the
[1:14:55] promise of the hour is a rapture. This
[1:14:57] is what begins to orient us on a reason
[1:14:59] to live different.
[1:15:02] This is why our faith in this hour is
[1:15:04] distinguished faith.
[1:15:07] Different is means not the same.
[1:15:08] Dissimilar in nature or quality. To be
[1:15:10] different is to set apart.
[1:15:12] And to be dissimilar in nature or
[1:15:14] quality doesn't mean to be entirely
[1:15:16] different. But it's just there is some
[1:15:17] difference.
[1:15:19] But when Paul says when I prophesy in
[1:15:22] part, I know in part, but when that
[1:15:23] which is perfect is come, which Brother
[1:15:25] Bam identified as an end time prophecy
[1:15:27] which is fulfilled at the open of the
[1:15:29] word, we do have today that which is
[1:15:31] perfect.
[1:15:32] The divine the perfect word by divine
[1:15:34] interpretation, we have that today. And
[1:15:36] Paul says that which is part is done
[1:15:38] away with. Now what some people think
[1:15:39] that means is you take the parts and
[1:15:41] trash them.
[1:15:43] But the parts are assumed into the
[1:15:45] whole.
[1:15:45] Correct?
[1:15:46] So now the parts are made perfect and
[1:15:48] complete. They have their purpose. They
[1:15:49] see their meaning. That they really mean
[1:15:51] something now because they've all worked
[1:15:52] to this perfect picture. So the parts
[1:15:54] are part of the perfection. And so when
[1:15:57] we say that we have a different faith,
[1:15:58] it doesn't mean it is completely and
[1:16:00] entirely different than what has been.
[1:16:03] But it is the perfection of what was
[1:16:05] they without us could not be made
[1:16:07] perfect. So if we we bring the
[1:16:09] perfection, then if they without us
[1:16:11] could not be perfect, then the inverse
[1:16:13] is true as well.
[1:16:15] Where's the capstone without the rest?
[1:16:17] It need it. It's they join together and
[1:16:20] unite. There's this mutual dependency
[1:16:21] where no one's looking down at the other
[1:16:23] person. Nobody's pointing fingers. But
[1:16:25] now when that which is perfect has come.
[1:16:26] The parts are assumed into the whole and
[1:16:28] it makes up one great big body of the
[1:16:30] Lord Jesus Christ for us to go in the
[1:16:32] rapture.
[1:16:34] Very good.
[1:16:35] But this difference it means there is
[1:16:37] something different in nature quality
[1:16:40] and in spiritual food and due season.
[1:16:42] And I found myself kind of getting lost
[1:16:43] in this last week of wanting to just
[1:16:45] read all the statements that Brother Man
[1:16:47] makes that zeros in on this particular
[1:16:48] thought, but this is probably the one
[1:16:50] that's the most uh well known. He says,
[1:16:52] "I want you to get built up now in the
[1:16:54] holy oracles of God in the faith." And
[1:16:56] he says, "The faith of this hour."
[1:16:59] Amen.
[1:17:01] The faith. It's going to take more faith
[1:17:03] than ever was in any age.
[1:17:05] For this has to be rapturing faith be
[1:17:07] taken up.
[1:17:08] So he uses that phrase, a rapturing
[1:17:10] grace, a rapturing faith. and and that
[1:17:12] the church doesn't have it yet and we
[1:17:13] don't have what it's going to take but
[1:17:14] it's going to take something a
[1:17:16] manifestation of God to stir the bride
[1:17:18] something that's going to be revealed
[1:17:19] and give the bride rapture faith going
[1:17:20] to get the bride together for rapturing
[1:17:22] faith why it was a need in this hour
[1:17:25] and God will give it and reveal it when
[1:17:27] you have need of it so it's coming to
[1:17:28] this time in this moment where this is
[1:17:30] the faith that we must have he says it's
[1:17:31] a rapturing faith and it's more faith if
[1:17:34] I could say a different faith than
[1:17:36] there's been in any age for this is has
[1:17:38] to be rapturing faith to be taken up and
[1:17:40] so we want you to believe tonight and
[1:17:42] and notice how beautiful this is in all
[1:17:44] that you have seen and heard,
[1:17:46] the word that you have heard preached,
[1:17:48] the signs and wonders that you have seen
[1:17:50] done. So now there's a momentum to
[1:17:53] everything that's been done. There's no
[1:17:54] disparaging it. There's no, oh, there
[1:17:56] was nothing to it. There's no, oh, we're
[1:17:58] so different. We we want to disassociate
[1:18:00] ourselves from. No, when we come to
[1:18:02] rapture faith, it's the product
[1:18:05] of what has been. Even when you look at
[1:18:08] the ministry of brother Brandham and
[1:18:09] from 47 to 63, I know there's always a
[1:18:13] um this debate and maybe sometimes we
[1:18:15] joke about it like when did brother
[1:18:16] Brandham say it? Was it before 63 or
[1:18:18] after 63?
[1:18:20] And for a number of years I I' I've been
[1:18:23] saying well the year in which he was a
[1:18:24] prophet is when he said it.
[1:18:26] And that kind of always, you know,
[1:18:30] kind of puts an end to that.
[1:18:32] But when you if you think of it in terms
[1:18:34] of 47 to 63, uh there's no there's
[1:18:37] nothing wasted in this
[1:18:40] because these were the years of
[1:18:41] preparation and groundwork for the
[1:18:43] capstone to settle upon.
[1:18:45] This these were the things that would
[1:18:47] that are are key to the blending and the
[1:18:49] union of the present Christ with the
[1:18:51] individual. The union of of that seventh
[1:18:54] seal which is Christ and the bride in
[1:18:56] this age. This is the union. these
[1:18:58] things that he preached beforehand were
[1:19:00] critical to come to that place.
[1:19:03] And so he's saying, "Let everything
[1:19:04] that's been said and preached," he says,
[1:19:06] "and all the signs and wonders you've
[1:19:07] seen." I love it how he says this, "We
[1:19:09] want you to accumulate all that together
[1:19:11] in your heart and consider it whether it
[1:19:13] be of God or not.
[1:19:15] Let everything that's been done
[1:19:17] accumulate in your heart. young people,
[1:19:18] even at your tender age, whatever God
[1:19:20] has done for you in your life through
[1:19:22] the prior uh youth weekend last year,
[1:19:24] the subsequent youth camp that came,
[1:19:26] even this youth weekend and all the
[1:19:27] other camps we have the privilege of
[1:19:28] being a part of and the special meetings
[1:19:30] and services and the times that God
[1:19:32] moves and all the testimonies we have.
[1:19:33] Let it accumulate in your heart.
[1:19:35] Let it build momentum. Let let it be
[1:19:38] increasing and growing because in this
[1:19:40] hour, we've got to have a greater faith.
[1:19:42] Amen.
[1:19:44] Got to have a supreme faith.
[1:19:45] Amen. a distinguished faith.
[1:19:49] And that's what we recognize here in
[1:19:50] Exodus 11. We'll start with verse four.
[1:19:52] And Moses said, "Thus sayeth the Lord,
[1:19:54] about midnight will I go out into the
[1:19:55] midst of Egypt, and all the firstborn in
[1:19:57] the land of Egypt shall die. From the
[1:19:59] firstborn of Pharaoh that siteth upon
[1:20:00] his throne, even unto the firstborn of
[1:20:02] the maid servants that is behind the
[1:20:03] mill, and all the firstborn of the
[1:20:04] beast, and there shall be a great cry
[1:20:06] throughout all the land, such as there
[1:20:07] not was none like it, nor shall be like
[1:20:09] it anymore." Death. Brother said, "The
[1:20:12] last plague that hits the earth is
[1:20:14] spiritual death. Amen.
[1:20:17] And there is a there's a spiritual death
[1:20:20] that the the whole world is going to
[1:20:22] succumb to, but it's the one thing the
[1:20:24] bride's immune to
[1:20:27] is spiritual death. That's the only
[1:20:28] plague we have to worry uh that we
[1:20:30] that's the one plague we don't have to
[1:20:31] worry about
[1:20:32] because we're not we we can't be touched
[1:20:34] by it.
[1:20:35] But in this there is a type of just
[1:20:37] death itself.
[1:20:40] And so in this moment where in God said
[1:20:42] that you are surely going to go out
[1:20:44] hence altogether. you're going to be
[1:20:45] thrust out. I'm going to bring this one
[1:20:47] plague and afterwards he will let you
[1:20:49] go. So, it's this plague now that's
[1:20:50] going to bring death upon every other
[1:20:52] household. Death is going to visit
[1:20:54] Egypt. But God wants to in this in this
[1:20:57] he wants to do something. And he says in
[1:20:59] verse 7, "But against any of the
[1:21:01] children of Israel shall not a dog move
[1:21:03] his tongue against man or beast."
[1:21:05] There's going to be no reproach, no
[1:21:07] offense, nothing taken from, no
[1:21:09] intimidation, nothing to fear astra.
[1:21:13] And so I'm going to preserve you holy.
[1:21:15] I'm going to distinguish you from
[1:21:17] everyone else. I'm going to protect you.
[1:21:19] I'm going to uphold you. I'm going to
[1:21:20] preserve you. I'm going to keep you from
[1:21:22] this this imminent death. Why? Why are
[1:21:24] you going to do that ye may know how
[1:21:27] that the Lord doth put a difference
[1:21:29] between the Egyptians and Israel?
[1:21:33] God wanted to put a difference between
[1:21:36] Israel and everyone else. That's right.
[1:21:38] And God, the same God today in this
[1:21:40] third Exodus desires to put a difference
[1:21:43] between the bride and the world.
[1:21:47] I going to put a difference. Those who
[1:21:48] are not going to succumb to death, he's
[1:21:50] saying here in Exodus, I want them to
[1:21:52] know that there's a difference between
[1:21:53] the Egyptians and Israel. And in this
[1:21:55] third Exodus, once again, there is a
[1:21:57] difference that God wants to put between
[1:21:59] you and the world.
[1:22:00] Amen.
[1:22:02] Difference. When he says, "I lord uh put
[1:22:05] a difference in the Hebrew means to be
[1:22:06] distinct and marked out to be
[1:22:08] separated." It means to be
[1:22:10] distinguished.
[1:22:13] And when something is distinguished,
[1:22:14] even in our vernacular and even the more
[1:22:17] uh modern etmology of this word,
[1:22:19] distinguished means to separate from
[1:22:21] others by superior abilities.
[1:22:23] When a distinguished person, a
[1:22:25] distinguished gentleman, someone
[1:22:26] distinguished is someone who is
[1:22:27] separated by superior character or
[1:22:30] superior achievements.
[1:22:32] Re said the faith in this hour is going
[1:22:35] to have to be more than there was in any
[1:22:36] other age. It's going to be a superior
[1:22:38] faith.
[1:22:40] So something in character and
[1:22:42] achievement.
[1:22:44] Many different scriptures we could use
[1:22:46] how the many women have done virtuously
[1:22:48] but thou excelst them all. How expounded
[1:22:51] a a more excellent way in the scripture.
[1:22:53] And unless your righteousness exceed the
[1:22:56] righteousness of the scribes and
[1:22:57] Pharisees, you'll find that there's a
[1:22:58] principle of something's good and
[1:23:00] something can be better, and then
[1:23:01] something can be the best.
[1:23:02] Amen.
[1:23:03] Right. Amen.
[1:23:04] An excellent way, a more excellent way.
[1:23:06] That that there can be a a virtuous but
[1:23:09] an excelling them all. And Hebrews 11:4
[1:23:12] says, "By faith, Abel offered unto God a
[1:23:15] more excellent sacrifice than Cain."
[1:23:18] Maybe it could be said that Cain had an
[1:23:19] excellent sacrifice, but excellent
[1:23:21] sacrifice wasn't what was needed. A more
[1:23:23] excellent sacrifice is what was needed.
[1:23:26] He offered a more excellent, it means
[1:23:27] greater in quality. It means superior.
[1:23:29] He offered a superior sacrifice than
[1:23:32] Cain. And it was by faith that he did
[1:23:34] it. So he had a superior revelation
[1:23:36] which brought about a superior
[1:23:37] manifestation.
[1:23:39] He had a superior faith. So it brought a
[1:23:40] superior sacrifice. A superior
[1:23:42] revelation brought brought something
[1:23:44] that was superior. It was distinguished
[1:23:45] from Cain.
[1:23:47] Amen.
[1:23:48] So we've got to have a different faith
[1:23:50] in this hour. That's right.
[1:23:52] Brother Bam was talking about this isn't
[1:23:53] Pentecost. This isn't that. This isn't
[1:23:55] this. He said this is for the bride
[1:23:57] going home of the bride. What we've
[1:23:59] received in this hour is for the bride.
[1:24:02] It's for the bride's going home. He says
[1:24:04] we got something different.
[1:24:09] It's important. I know this might just
[1:24:11] be rehearsing some cliches to you, but
[1:24:13] these things are real.
[1:24:15] And if they've kind of lost their
[1:24:16] distinction through repetition, let it
[1:24:18] kind of let the Lord just come and reset
[1:24:20] your mind so you can hear how clear this
[1:24:22] is and you can say shibth to it. You can
[1:24:24] actually hear what's being said that we
[1:24:27] have something different.
[1:24:31] Amen.
[1:24:32] And the message Balman Gilead and and I
[1:24:34] think this will kind of bring it down to
[1:24:37] relevancy for us. He says the one thing
[1:24:39] that we have to move up to now is a
[1:24:42] supreme faith to what we have had.
[1:24:44] Again, this is in harmony with brother
[1:24:46] Brandham in his prophetic vision to see
[1:24:49] that we've got to come to this capstone.
[1:24:51] We've got to come to this climax. We're
[1:24:53] in this age and this time that his
[1:24:55] coming will be in. So, there's got to be
[1:24:56] a rapturing faith. And so, he calls it
[1:24:59] that what we have to move up into is a
[1:25:00] supreme faith. He says, "Then what we've
[1:25:02] had."
[1:25:03] Yeah.
[1:25:04] And he makes the statement maybe in
[1:25:06] other places and I'm just not recalling
[1:25:09] the word. So this is just clearly my um
[1:25:11] summation of it that we can hardly have
[1:25:14] enough faith for a toothache.
[1:25:16] But we're going to have to have faith to
[1:25:17] change our bodies.
[1:25:19] A and so it's kind of put in that vein
[1:25:21] that you he says in one place, you will
[1:25:22] have to have power to change your body.
[1:25:25] Listen, it's not brother Brandon will
[1:25:27] have the power to change our bodies and
[1:25:29] we're all just going to kind of get in
[1:25:30] the line.
[1:25:31] A
[1:25:32] and and he's going to sprinkle fairy
[1:25:34] dust on us and we're going to change
[1:25:35] into a new body. No, you're going to
[1:25:37] have to have faith. You're going to have
[1:25:38] to have the power to change your body.
[1:25:41] Amen.
[1:25:42] And so he says, "And you cannot have
[1:25:44] that faith, supreme faith, until you
[1:25:46] know perfectly what you are doing."
[1:25:49] All right, that kind of makes it a
[1:25:51] little
[1:25:52] I mean that that uh that could be a
[1:25:54] little bit discouraging to know
[1:25:55] perfectly what you're doing. I mean, we
[1:25:57] can go to school for 12 years and get
[1:25:58] out and still not per know perfectly
[1:26:00] what we're doing.
[1:26:01] I mean, just think about the doctors.
[1:26:02] Just I think there's some uh doctors in
[1:26:05] the church and maybe some PAs and what
[1:26:07] do they call what they do? Practice.
[1:26:13] I mean, at least I'm just drafting a
[1:26:14] contract. It's not like I'm performing a
[1:26:16] surgery. I mean, I can practice on a
[1:26:18] will, right? What's the worst thing? I'm
[1:26:19] sorry you lost your house, right?
[1:26:21] But I mean, they're practicing and
[1:26:23] they've been in school for all this
[1:26:24] time.
[1:26:26] We're talking about practice.
[1:26:30] I know it has a different meaning, but
[1:26:32] you cannot have that faith until you
[1:26:34] know perfectly what you were doing. Now
[1:26:37] stay with me here. When you with me
[1:26:38] here, when you understand, he goes like
[1:26:40] you walk. Okay, now that's different. He
[1:26:44] says, you just say, well, I'm going
[1:26:46] home. I'm going out and going to start
[1:26:48] the car. That's all an act of faith.
[1:26:52] Tomorrow I'll meet you at a certain
[1:26:54] place. That's all an act of faith. Now,
[1:26:56] catch this, young people. This is what I
[1:26:58] want you to get into this this mode
[1:27:00] because you've just done it so much
[1:27:02] because it's a regular routine with you.
[1:27:05] Remember how we read a moment ago,
[1:27:06] brother says, just let it all accumulate
[1:27:07] together in your heart. So, we're
[1:27:09] wanting things, we're wanting these
[1:27:10] things to accumulate. He says, when you
[1:27:12] go walk home, he says, you've just done
[1:27:14] it so much, it's a regular routine.
[1:27:15] Well, that's the way the things of God
[1:27:17] are. I
[1:27:18] I'm wanting to introduce a new routine
[1:27:20] to you. Not in a bad way, but in a
[1:27:21] positive good way. That's the way the
[1:27:23] things of God are. after you've trusted
[1:27:25] him and watched him do so many things
[1:27:27] until it becomes just like a regular
[1:27:29] routine.
[1:27:29] Yeah.
[1:27:30] And that's the condition I think the
[1:27:32] church will be in just before the coming
[1:27:34] of the Lord.
[1:27:35] Listen, so the rapture will just go
[1:27:38] right on that way.
[1:27:39] Wow.
[1:27:40] I know we can get in our minds that I
[1:27:42] know I know the rapture is going to be
[1:27:45] on Saturday night in Dry Creek,
[1:27:46] Louisiana.
[1:27:48] Right. We just know that's where we're
[1:27:49] going to all have to get there one day.
[1:27:51] And that's where it's going to happen
[1:27:52] because that's the dynamic. That's the
[1:27:54] power. That's the move. That's the
[1:27:56] That's the one that really gets us. But
[1:27:58] he's saying, "No, it's going to it's
[1:27:59] going to happen. The rapture will go on
[1:28:02] right that way." He says, "It'll just be
[1:28:04] a regular routine of following the
[1:28:06] scriptures and the plans of God."
[1:28:08] The rapture is going to come to pass in
[1:28:10] your life as you follow the regular
[1:28:12] routine of following the scriptures and
[1:28:15] the plans of God. How is the rapture
[1:28:18] going to be relevant in your life? How
[1:28:19] are you going to achieve a rapture in
[1:28:20] your life? I've got to get in the
[1:28:22] regular routine of following God. I've
[1:28:24] got to follow the plan of God for my
[1:28:26] life, not somebody else's plan, but the
[1:28:28] plan of God for my life. And that's
[1:28:30] where this change is going to come.
[1:28:32] [Applause]
[1:28:34] And that's the mystery of supreme faith.
[1:28:36] That's right.
[1:28:37] Amen.
[1:28:38] Just the regular routine of following
[1:28:39] the scriptures.
[1:28:42] You can you and I I I can say this
[1:28:44] because having grown up in Texas so near
[1:28:47] and some of my precious memories in my
[1:28:49] youth of being of the of Louisiana youth
[1:28:51] camp, that's that's where births take
[1:28:53] place.
[1:28:55] I can remember I I remember different
[1:28:57] ones. That's where they're first
[1:28:58] introduced to the supernatural.
[1:29:01] And you want that accum to accumulate in
[1:29:03] your heart. Yeah,
[1:29:05] you want that to be added in your to
[1:29:07] your faith bank to say, "Now look at how
[1:29:09] God can meet me there." And then we
[1:29:11] don't get in this cycle of the uh the
[1:29:13] the cycle of camp meeting cramps and
[1:29:15] that cycle brother talks about to where
[1:29:17] we're just moving from one meeting to
[1:29:18] the next, one meeting to the next. We
[1:29:20] want to get into the regular routine of
[1:29:22] the scripture day by day by day. What
[1:29:26] can get me in that pattern is things
[1:29:28] like this weekend, things like the camps
[1:29:30] we have. It wants to usher us into a
[1:29:32] different flow and we start to move
[1:29:34] within the regular routine of the
[1:29:35] scriptures because that's supreme faith.
[1:29:38] Supreme faith is evident in these daily
[1:29:40] acts after you trust him and washed and
[1:29:42] do so many things till it becomes
[1:29:44] regular routine and that's how the
[1:29:46] rapture will go. A regular routine of
[1:29:48] following the scriptures in the plan of
[1:29:50] God.
[1:29:50] No religious routine, not a routine of
[1:29:52] going to church, not tradition or
[1:29:54] impersonation, but the regular routine
[1:29:56] of following the scriptures.
[1:29:58] Amen. finding the heartbeat of God, the
[1:30:01] purpose of God, and then walking in its
[1:30:02] rhythm.
[1:30:04] Brother Bram says, "And does God change
[1:30:06] his mind?" Enoch had enough faith that
[1:30:08] he didn't have to die.
[1:30:10] He just took an afternoon stroll
[1:30:13] and got tired here on earth and just
[1:30:15] walked on up to heaven.
[1:30:16] Yeah,
[1:30:18] that that's what we've got to do. We got
[1:30:20] to get sick and tired of this world.
[1:30:22] And really, a true perfect revelation of
[1:30:24] justification is what's going to produce
[1:30:26] the rapture.
[1:30:27] Because when you realize, as brother Ram
[1:30:29] said, invisible union, I don't have to
[1:30:31] die for that sin.
[1:30:35] He says, I certainly like to have faith
[1:30:37] like that.
[1:30:38] Enoch had enough faith not to die. He
[1:30:40] just took a walk, got sick of this
[1:30:42] earth, walked up. He says, I would
[1:30:44] certainly like to have faith like that,
[1:30:45] but I hope that we do get that faith
[1:30:47] someday.
[1:30:48] Amen.
[1:30:49] So, this is an objective. This is a goal
[1:30:51] as we grow on into him.
[1:30:54] So, we will get that faith as we grow.
[1:30:56] Yes,
[1:30:57] as we grow on into him. So, this is the
[1:31:00] this is where I'm wanting to bring this
[1:31:01] distinguished faith. It's a rapturing
[1:31:03] faith.
[1:31:04] It's a faith that has its eyes. It's a
[1:31:06] supreme faith that's looking out into
[1:31:08] the future. Saying, I want to get into
[1:31:10] this regular routine of the scripture.
[1:31:11] Not just so that I can be a good message
[1:31:13] believer, not just so I can make my
[1:31:14] parents happy. Not so that I can be a
[1:31:16] deacon one day or I could be a preacher.
[1:31:18] We could get everything in order in
[1:31:19] church order. Everything that's being
[1:31:21] done in churches and in family in this
[1:31:23] hour is for the purpose of a rapture.
[1:31:25] Our family autos must be rapture or
[1:31:27] bust. Our church motto is rapture or
[1:31:29] bust. We are not trying to leave a
[1:31:31] legacy of a church. We're not trying to
[1:31:33] leave a leave a legacy of a ministry.
[1:31:35] We're trying to lead. Period.
[1:31:38] This message by default is a rapture
[1:31:41] message.
[1:31:47] And so this is our distinguished faith.
[1:31:49] This is our this is our difference. Now
[1:31:52] in John chapter 14:es 1-3
[1:31:56] he says let not your heart be troubled
[1:31:58] that's inward commotion that's the chaos
[1:32:00] of the mind really I hope you can relate
[1:32:03] to this is to be restless
[1:32:06] let not your heart be troubled don't be
[1:32:08] anxious struck with fear this dread some
[1:32:10] of us can experience this for no known
[1:32:12] reason we just feel anxious and we feel
[1:32:16] uh uh we we feel it physically we're
[1:32:18] gripped the loss of appetite and the the
[1:32:21] fear the or boating. You're just
[1:32:22] constantly looking over your shoulder.
[1:32:24] You think something's going to catch
[1:32:25] you. He's saying, "Don't let your heart
[1:32:26] be troubled,
[1:32:29] chaos of mind, restlessness. It's an
[1:32:31] anxiety, a feeling of worry or
[1:32:33] nervousness."
[1:32:35] And and typically this fear, which says,
[1:32:37] "Let not your heart be troubled." The
[1:32:38] word he's using is typically about some
[1:32:40] imminent event or something with some
[1:32:42] uncertain outcome to let not your heart
[1:32:45] be troubled. It's excessive
[1:32:46] apprehension.
[1:32:48] And it's these apprehensions and these
[1:32:51] anxieties that result in compulsive
[1:32:52] compulsive behaviors
[1:32:55] that cause us to do things in a nature
[1:32:57] that hurts ourselves or harms ourselves
[1:32:59] or we try to numb ourselves. There's
[1:33:00] ways it it's even this uh excessive
[1:33:02] apprehension that leads to panic
[1:33:04] attacks.
[1:33:04] Yes. Amen.
[1:33:06] And so when he says let not your heart
[1:33:08] be troubled, this is quite a statement.
[1:33:11] And he says ye believe in God believe
[1:33:13] also in me. And so there has to be even
[1:33:16] some zero in over faith. We're not just
[1:33:19] believing in a divine. We're not just
[1:33:20] believing in the deity. We're not just
[1:33:21] believing in something greater, but
[1:33:22] we're leaving in a God who has a purpose
[1:33:24] and an intent. And then he says this,
[1:33:26] and this is directly connected to his
[1:33:28] desire to ease their anxiety. In my
[1:33:31] father's house are many mansions.
[1:33:33] These are bodies. If it were not so, I
[1:33:36] would have told you. I go to prepare a
[1:33:38] place for you. And if I go and prepare a
[1:33:40] place for you, I will come again and
[1:33:42] receive you unto myself, that where I
[1:33:44] am, there you may be also.
[1:33:46] I don't know if you caught Christ's
[1:33:48] prescription for anxiety. He has a
[1:33:50] prescription for it.
[1:33:52] He wants to prescribe you something that
[1:33:54] you can take that'll remedy and ease
[1:33:57] your anxiety. And his remedy for
[1:33:59] anxiety, his remedy for mental distress
[1:34:01] was to begin to talk to them about the
[1:34:03] future.
[1:34:05] to begin to get their hopes and set
[1:34:07] their affections on something beyond
[1:34:09] what was immediately in front of them.
[1:34:10] Let not your hearts be troubled. Don't
[1:34:12] be anxious about this life. Don't be uh
[1:34:14] so bowed down and concerned about what
[1:34:16] even awaits you with in these imminent
[1:34:18] days. But know that there in my father's
[1:34:21] house are many mansions and I'm going to
[1:34:23] go and prepare a place that where I am
[1:34:25] you may be also. And I'm going to come
[1:34:26] again to receive you. So, it caused them
[1:34:28] to kind of just leap over all the trials
[1:34:30] of this life and realize that just
[1:34:32] beyond this, there's a place that's
[1:34:34] prepared. Just beyond this life that we
[1:34:37] see now, there's a new body. Beyond this
[1:34:39] flesh that gets hurted, hurt and pained
[1:34:41] and broken a and and bowed down. That
[1:34:44] just beyond this, there's a perfect
[1:34:45] body. Just beyond tomorrow, there
[1:34:48] there's going to be a future. There's an
[1:34:49] eternity. Just beyond the seven days of
[1:34:51] this week, there's going to be an eighth
[1:34:53] day, an eternal day that'll never end.
[1:34:56] Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:34:58] And brother Brandham says he was telling
[1:35:00] them that after death there is life and
[1:35:02] this is in things that are to be because
[1:35:04] I go and prepare a place that is to
[1:35:06] receive them. Shows that there he's
[1:35:10] speaking to them that there was a life
[1:35:12] after this life is ended. And he says
[1:35:15] what a consolation that ought to give us
[1:35:16] all.
[1:35:18] To know that after this life is over
[1:35:20] there is a life that we go into.
[1:35:22] Amen.
[1:35:24] This is the consolation. Maybe you want
[1:35:26] there to be some sort of prophecy over
[1:35:28] your life that you'll you will get that
[1:35:30] degree that you're so hungry for. You
[1:35:31] will get that coding job that'll be six
[1:35:33] figures. You will that that uh altcoin
[1:35:35] that you've put all your savings in is
[1:35:37] going to take off and you're going to
[1:35:38] make millions of dollars and this
[1:35:40] downward trend of all the cryptocurrency
[1:35:42] and all the stocks, that ETF you put all
[1:35:44] in on, it's not going to be down 100%.
[1:35:46] You're going to get it all back. And
[1:35:47] that's what we're waiting. You're
[1:35:48] wanting me to prognosticate that there's
[1:35:50] signs are looking up for the oil, signs
[1:35:52] up looking good for this stock, and it's
[1:35:53] looking good for Bitcoin. everything's
[1:35:55] going to steady itself out. No, our
[1:35:57] promises aren't in that. Our hope isn't
[1:35:58] in that.
[1:35:59] The consolation isn't the turn of
[1:36:01] economic events. The consolation isn't
[1:36:03] that we'll finally get a Republican back
[1:36:05] in the presidency. None of that's going
[1:36:06] to console anything. Our consolation is
[1:36:09] I've gone to prepare a place for you.
[1:36:12] And that's your place, too.
[1:36:14] It's for the going home of the bride.
[1:36:17] This world is not my home. I have an
[1:36:20] eternal destiny.
[1:36:23] Amen. When this life is over, there's a
[1:36:25] life that we go into. That's the
[1:36:27] consolation. Paul writes in 2
[1:36:29] Corinthians 5:1, "For we know that if
[1:36:31] our earthly house of this tabernacle
[1:36:32] were dissolved, we have a building of
[1:36:34] God, a house not made with hands,
[1:36:36] eternal in the heavens."
[1:36:38] Amen.
[1:36:40] Amen.
[1:36:41] It was eternal in the heavens. So if it
[1:36:43] was, they say that's where we're going.
[1:36:45] But if it was eternal in the heavens,
[1:36:46] that's where we were.
[1:36:49] And let's just do the math. If I was if
[1:36:52] I was perfect then and I'll be perfect.
[1:36:54] If I was perfect back there and I'll be
[1:36:56] perfect over here.
[1:36:59] You're perfect now.
[1:37:04] Amen.
[1:37:06] This is the real hope.
[1:37:07] That's right. Amen.
[1:37:08] This must be part of our reason and
[1:37:10] purpose of being. This has to be part of
[1:37:12] your goal.
[1:37:13] I I there's and I I want to emphasize
[1:37:16] this to you young people. I know it
[1:37:17] might seem kind of lofty or brother,
[1:37:19] this would be better for a ministers
[1:37:20] meeting. No, we only get together as
[1:37:22] ministers so that we can be encouraging
[1:37:23] one another to minister to the bride. We
[1:37:25] are servants to the bride. You are the
[1:37:27] objective. You're the goal. It's your
[1:37:28] faith that is that issue.
[1:37:30] Not our reputations, not our
[1:37:32] testimonies, not our resumes.
[1:37:34] Amen.
[1:37:36] Amen.
[1:37:36] This has got to be your goal. Notice how
[1:37:38] it says in Colossians 1:5, for the hope
[1:37:40] which is laid up for you in heaven. So
[1:37:42] this hope which is laid up for you in
[1:37:44] heaven, this is your expectation. This
[1:37:45] is your confident joy. Your he says it's
[1:37:48] laid up for you in heaven. And he says,
[1:37:50] "Whereof have you heard before in the
[1:37:52] word of truth of the gospel." What
[1:37:54] inspires your hope? The word.
[1:37:56] So you have a hope laid up for you in
[1:37:58] heaven. You have a hope that has been
[1:37:59] quicken and birth. Even what the baptism
[1:38:01] of the Holy Ghost is, what is it? An
[1:38:03] earnest.
[1:38:04] It's the guarantee of full redemption.
[1:38:07] Amen.
[1:38:08] So even the seal of God, I sealed. I'm
[1:38:10] sealed and I've made it. No. No. That's
[1:38:12] just a reminder.
[1:38:14] Yeah. That's the down payment of the
[1:38:16] fullness of redemption that's given to
[1:38:19] you to give you this confidence that you
[1:38:20] are going to come up in a resurrection
[1:38:22] and that if you're alive and remaining,
[1:38:24] you will not taste death, but you'll be
[1:38:25] changed in a moment, in a twinkle of an
[1:38:26] eye. That's what the seal of God is for.
[1:38:29] That's what the Holy Ghost is for. It's
[1:38:30] for the rapture of the bride and the
[1:38:32] resurrection of all saints.
[1:38:35] Amen.
[1:38:36] He says, "So that when you have this
[1:38:37] hope by the word, the word is what
[1:38:39] spires our hopes. confident hope. The
[1:38:42] the way the scripture strikes me is the
[1:38:44] the word of God is preached and we know
[1:38:46] that we have a hope in heaven. So this
[1:38:48] confident hope that we have is born from
[1:38:51] experiencing heavenly things.
[1:38:53] Amen.
[1:38:54] This confident hope is born by
[1:38:56] experiencing what heaven holds for us.
[1:38:58] These services is a taste of eternity.
[1:39:00] The move of God, divine healing is what?
[1:39:02] A type of the change of our body.
[1:39:04] Everything that God can do in the
[1:39:06] natural, in the spiritual sense, of
[1:39:08] healing us and delivering us and
[1:39:09] quickening things to us, has got to get
[1:39:11] our minds thinking an eternal way,
[1:39:12] there's a heaven to come. There's an
[1:39:14] eternity to come. Everything he's doing
[1:39:16] ought to be reminding us that heaven
[1:39:18] awaits us.
[1:39:20] This is what heaven holds for us.
[1:39:22] God.
[1:39:23] So, when brother Brand's preaching
[1:39:24] things that are to be, he said, I want
[1:39:26] to preach, he refers to, he says, I
[1:39:28] think as Christians, we kind of ought to
[1:39:29] be notified ahead of time.
[1:39:32] Amen. He says, "So we're notified what
[1:39:34] our destination will be." Now, have you
[1:39:36] ever thought about why he told us what
[1:39:39] the things that are to be, the reason
[1:39:41] for it?
[1:39:43] And because one one thing that's
[1:39:45] remarkable, I'll share this and this
[1:39:46] this may this may put push lunch off a
[1:39:49] little bit. So pull as hard as you can
[1:39:51] because I'll I'll say it, but I'll just
[1:39:52] go faster the harder you pull.
[1:39:56] And the world, what has been makes you
[1:39:57] what you are.
[1:40:00] you are today in from a worldly sense a
[1:40:02] product of your your nature from your
[1:40:04] parents and the nurture from the
[1:40:05] environment that you're raised in. And
[1:40:07] so if you want to understand somebody,
[1:40:09] you begin to look back in terms of what
[1:40:10] has happened. And either that's a
[1:40:12] approach when you're trying to figure
[1:40:13] out why someone is a certain way. You
[1:40:15] ask them, "What's happened to you? What
[1:40:16] have you been through? What have you
[1:40:18] experienced?" Because it'll give you
[1:40:19] context for the way they're thinking and
[1:40:20] acting in the present. That's the world.
[1:40:23] For the bride and the children, it's the
[1:40:25] complete opposite.
[1:40:26] Right? Right?
[1:40:27] The things that are to be change things
[1:40:29] now
[1:40:31] that it's not your past that has defined
[1:40:33] you, but it's what you're going to be
[1:40:34] that defines you. It works in the
[1:40:36] inverse where it's like what I'm going
[1:40:37] to be is imposing itself on who I am
[1:40:40] now. And what I'm going to be in the
[1:40:43] future is work into my life to change
[1:40:46] who I am now. So that it interrupts what
[1:40:49] has been. And now as I go forward, I'm
[1:40:51] not a reflection and a accumulation of
[1:40:54] what has happened in the natural, but I
[1:40:56] am a manifestation of what will be in
[1:40:58] the supernatural.
[1:41:00] And the things that will be have changed
[1:41:02] the things that are.
[1:41:07] So he says we ought we are notified of
[1:41:11] how what our destination will be.
[1:41:13] Now why does he tell us what our
[1:41:14] destination will be? Because destination
[1:41:17] determines preparation.
[1:41:18] Amen. Amen.
[1:41:19] If you ever say we're going to go on a
[1:41:20] vacation, we want let's check the
[1:41:22] weather, right?
[1:41:24] When we we want to know where we're
[1:41:25] where we're traveling to because based
[1:41:27] upon where we're going, we pack and we
[1:41:29] prepare based on where we're going.
[1:41:32] You don't you don't pack based upon the
[1:41:35] point of departure.
[1:41:36] Amen.
[1:41:37] Amen.
[1:41:40] That's right.
[1:41:43] If you're going to go skiing,
[1:41:45] you don't take Buford weather and pack
[1:41:47] your bags and dress and get all ready to
[1:41:49] go skiing. Uh uh uh and then fly out to
[1:41:51] Aspen and then you're you're caught up
[1:41:53] in the cold and like, "Oh, I should have
[1:41:55] planned better. Should have thought more
[1:41:56] about where I was going."
[1:41:58] So, when you know where you're going and
[1:42:00] you're notified ahead of time of what
[1:42:01] your destination will be, you begin to
[1:42:03] prepare yourself and get yourself ready
[1:42:05] for the destination.
[1:42:07] You can go to the airport in some of
[1:42:09] these colder climates and you could be
[1:42:11] there in Edmonton in the dead of winter
[1:42:13] in June and you could be there uh uh at
[1:42:16] the airport and you're all bundled up
[1:42:17] and you're cold. The coldest winter I
[1:42:19] ever spent was a summer in Grand
[1:42:20] Prairie, Alberta
[1:42:23] and and and you're you're there in the
[1:42:26] airport and you're all bundled up and
[1:42:27] you've even made it through security.
[1:42:28] and you still got all your layers on and
[1:42:29] it's in the dead of winter and you look
[1:42:31] over there and there's some guy in a
[1:42:32] Hawaiian shirt and sandals in the dead
[1:42:34] of winter in Edmonton.
[1:42:36] It has a check stub from his northern
[1:42:38] living allowance that he just collected
[1:42:40] made it down to Edmonton and he's
[1:42:41] completely dressed for the tropics and
[1:42:43] he why in the world is this guy dressed
[1:42:45] this way?
[1:42:46] Because of where he's going,
[1:42:48] not because of where he came from and
[1:42:50] where he is. He dressed the for to
[1:42:52] prepare himself for where he's going. I
[1:42:55] hope you're catching the revelation,
[1:42:56] young people. Where you're going is a
[1:42:58] holy place. Where you're going is a pure
[1:43:00] place. Where you're going is a happy
[1:43:02] place. So, I'm gonna prepare myself for
[1:43:06] where I'm going.
[1:43:10] You prepare based upon what will be.
[1:43:14] Amen.
[1:43:15] Brother says, "Every man that has the
[1:43:16] spiritual revealed truth of the will of
[1:43:18] God makes preparation for the
[1:43:19] fulfilling."
[1:43:20] Amen.
[1:43:21] If you've had a spiritual revealed truth
[1:43:23] of the will of God, you make preparation
[1:43:24] for the fulfilling. You're living to
[1:43:27] leave.
[1:43:29] That's what this is all about.
[1:43:31] I I'm not I'm not living I'm not living
[1:43:33] for a funeral. I I'm not living for
[1:43:35] accolades. You know, there's something
[1:43:36] to be written on my gravestone. I I I'm
[1:43:38] living for a rapture. I could say this
[1:43:40] that as a husband that if I can live
[1:43:42] with a rapture in view, I can have a
[1:43:44] testimony of a good husband. If I live
[1:43:46] as a father with the rapture in view and
[1:43:49] I can commit myself to that and I could
[1:43:51] prepare myself based upon my destiny and
[1:43:53] not my family history and not my DNA and
[1:43:56] not what has been. Listen, a lot of us
[1:43:57] use the excuse of trauma to continue to
[1:44:00] act and live the way that we're living.
[1:44:01] And I'll say this, your trauma explains
[1:44:04] why you are the way you are. It is not
[1:44:06] an excuse to stay the way you are
[1:44:11] because there'll be no trauma there.
[1:44:13] Thank God there'll be no drama there.
[1:44:15] And we're going to a place that's pure,
[1:44:17] that's clean, that's holy. And if I
[1:44:19] could prepare myself for that destiny,
[1:44:22] then I know I'll be the right kind of
[1:44:24] father to my children.
[1:44:26] Hallelujah.
[1:44:27] Powerful.
[1:44:27] Amen.
[1:44:29] I am believing. So, I will be leaving.
[1:44:32] All right. Amen. That's right.
[1:44:34] Because I've had a spiritual revealed
[1:44:35] truth of the will of God and I'm making
[1:44:37] preparation for the fulfillment.
[1:44:42] And the message hearing and receiving
[1:44:43] acting. This was what crystallized this
[1:44:47] entire thought. A reason to live
[1:44:51] different.
[1:44:52] Brother says the believer has something
[1:44:54] to live for.
[1:44:56] We ought to live like it. Reaching every
[1:44:58] day for everything that we can get a
[1:44:59] hold of from God.
[1:45:00] Leaving the world behind. Burning your
[1:45:02] ships every day. Burning the track
[1:45:04] behind you. Keep on moving. Reaching.
[1:45:06] Pulling. Seeking. Hungering. Thirsting
[1:45:08] for God. Amen.
[1:45:09] He says, "Be real fanatically about it."
[1:45:11] That's right.
[1:45:12] Just move on.
[1:45:13] That's right.
[1:45:14] I remember when brother Sammy Kenzer,
[1:45:16] the first time I ever met him, and um
[1:45:18] I'd went up to preach with brother or I
[1:45:20] didn't preach. I don't even know if I
[1:45:21] was a preacher then. We went with
[1:45:22] Brother Juwel up to uh Gayelax,
[1:45:25] Virginia, and he preached a Sunday
[1:45:27] evening service. I'll never forget after
[1:45:29] he was done preaching, he carried like a
[1:45:31] bath towel from a Hampton Inn or
[1:45:33] something at his hanky. And uh and I
[1:45:35] remember after he was done preaching, he
[1:45:36] went in the back and changed into a
[1:45:38] t-shirt that said statue of a perfect
[1:45:40] man. And and he must have got it when he
[1:45:42] was a teenager and he was like the
[1:45:43] statue of a perfect man. And I'll never
[1:45:45] forget I was like, "Yes, that's the
[1:45:47] confession right there. That's we're
[1:45:48] believing in a statue of a perfect man."
[1:45:52] And and brother Sammy met me after
[1:45:53] service. He said, "God bless you, but
[1:45:55] son, you know, what's your name?" Was
[1:45:56] talking to him and he looked at me. He
[1:45:57] said, "Don't ever let anybody's take
[1:45:58] your fire away.
[1:46:00] Don't ever." He said, "Don't let any of
[1:46:02] these ministers, any of these men, don't
[1:46:03] let any of these old men try to take
[1:46:04] your fire away." And I experienced it
[1:46:06] time and time again, the envy and the
[1:46:08] jealousy and and the animosity that
[1:46:12] others can have towards fire.
[1:46:15] And I say, young people, don't ever let
[1:46:17] the the world or man take your fire
[1:46:21] away.
[1:46:30] If
[1:46:31] as as as brother Jason has for decades
[1:46:34] labored a and and you see the work of
[1:46:37] God and the tremendous work of God that
[1:46:39] is taking place here and then other
[1:46:41] ministries coming behind him. If for
[1:46:43] some reason that this would terry the
[1:46:46] greatest privilege we could have even as
[1:46:48] generations brother Jason myself brother
[1:46:50] Matthew brother Jason de Mars as we
[1:46:52] almost kind of stairstepped down if
[1:46:54] God's to the greatest privilege we could
[1:46:56] have is taking you as a generation and
[1:46:59] pushing you further than we are.
[1:47:01] The greatest privilege we could have
[1:47:03] would just be launching you into greater
[1:47:04] depth than we've experienced. Lifting
[1:47:06] you up higher than we were lifted. We
[1:47:08] would take greater joy in seeing your
[1:47:10] revelation exceed ours. Your ferveny
[1:47:13] exceed ours. Your joy exceed ours. The
[1:47:15] power of God be excessive in your life.
[1:47:18] I'd rather see you be more fanatical
[1:47:20] than me than to see your fires go out.
[1:47:24] Preaching, pulling, seeking, hungering.
[1:47:26] Be fanatic about it.
[1:47:28] He said, just move on. A fanatic is an
[1:47:30] overenthused person. He says, I'm really
[1:47:32] a fanatic. I'm overenthused about my
[1:47:34] Lord. How did he ever save me? How do
[1:47:36] you ever give me the Holy Ghost? Why do
[1:47:37] you ever let me preach? How do you ever
[1:47:38] let me love people and people love me?
[1:47:40] Oh, I'm so thrilled over him.
[1:47:42] I just keep reaching with all that's in
[1:47:44] me. Stretching my skin to try to get
[1:47:46] him.
[1:47:47] Just moving with everything that I've
[1:47:48] got. He's already got the Holy Ghost.
[1:47:50] And what is he doing? Reaching with all
[1:47:51] that's in him. Stretching my skin to try
[1:47:53] to get to him. Just moving with
[1:47:55] everything I've got. That's what we
[1:47:57] should do.
[1:47:58] He says, "It reminds me of the story I
[1:48:00] heard some time ago. Bunch of American
[1:48:02] artists went down into Rome to study
[1:48:04] art."
[1:48:06] Skipping some commentary about
[1:48:08] Americans. He says, "These artists, a
[1:48:10] bunch of artists, went to Rome to study
[1:48:12] art. All them go out at night time. Most
[1:48:14] of them get on a big drunk. Boys and
[1:48:16] girls lay out together just as some
[1:48:18] these modern Americans do. And these
[1:48:20] people would go out and drink and carry
[1:48:21] on. But one young man, they noticed that
[1:48:24] young man, he didn't carry on like that.
[1:48:26] He lived clean. At night time, he'd come
[1:48:29] home and went to bed. Lived like a
[1:48:30] gentleman should live. And one day, the
[1:48:32] old caretaker said, "I'd like to take a
[1:48:34] walk with you, son." He said, "All
[1:48:35] right, young fella. You come over here
[1:48:37] with a bunch of Americans, didn't you?
[1:48:38] Yes, sir, I did. I want to ask you
[1:48:40] something. All right. Why is it that you
[1:48:42] don't go out and drink and carry on and
[1:48:44] lay out with the girls and things and
[1:48:46] all through the night and come in the
[1:48:47] next morning the way they do?
[1:48:49] He said, he stopped, put his arm around
[1:48:51] the old man. He said, "You see the sun
[1:48:53] that's setting yonder in the west?"
[1:48:55] Yes, sir, I do. Beyond that setting of
[1:48:57] the sun, there's a certain state in New
[1:48:59] England. In that certain state is a
[1:49:01] certain city. In that certain city is a
[1:49:03] certain house. And in that certain house
[1:49:04] is a girl. And that girl, I vowed before
[1:49:07] I came here to be true to her when I
[1:49:08] return. And we're going to be married.
[1:49:11] She made a vow to me a promise.
[1:49:12] Therefore, sir, all my attention is
[1:49:14] attracted as far as it comes to women,
[1:49:15] towards the girl at that place.
[1:49:18] Amen.
[1:49:19] I live today for the tomorrow to come.
[1:49:23] And brother says, what a testimony.
[1:49:26] What a Christian can say, why don't you
[1:49:28] smoke? Why don't you have a little fun?
[1:49:31] Why don't you do this like the rest of
[1:49:32] them are doing? Oh, you can say beyond a
[1:49:34] certain store there's a certain city and
[1:49:36] that certain city is a certain person.
[1:49:38] Oh, I live for him who died for me and
[1:49:41] some days he coming. I live for that
[1:49:43] life that is to come. Oh, I would that
[1:49:46] there could be a revelation today to you
[1:49:48] young people that you're living this
[1:49:49] life for the one that is to come. All
[1:49:52] your decisions, all your breath, all
[1:49:54] your ambitions, all your struggles, all
[1:49:56] your trials, everything you've ever been
[1:49:58] through, it'll make sense over there.
[1:50:00] Hallelujah.
[1:50:01] Every sacrifice, every no, every
[1:50:04] restraint, everything you do, it'll make
[1:50:06] sense in that eternal life.
[1:50:09] Hallelujah.
[1:50:10] I live today for the tomorrow to come.
[1:50:16] I'm going to be pro proactive.
[1:50:19] I'll make sacrifices now. I'll say no
[1:50:21] now. I will assue the things of the
[1:50:23] world now. I won't enjoy the pleasures
[1:50:25] of sin for a season because I know my
[1:50:27] payoff is coming.
[1:50:30] I live for that life that is to come.
[1:50:32] Yes, sir.
[1:50:36] Paul said, "If in this life only," 1
[1:50:38] Corinthians 15:19, "if in this life only
[1:50:41] we have hope in Christ."
[1:50:44] This is Paul saying this for all every
[1:50:45] believer.
[1:50:47] If our hope is only in this life in
[1:50:50] Christ, if our hope in Christ is only
[1:50:54] related to this world and what he can
[1:50:56] bring,
[1:50:58] he he can bring divine healing. He can
[1:50:59] bring joy. He can bring peace. He can
[1:51:00] bring satisfaction. He can bring
[1:51:02] deliverance of drugs and alcohol and all
[1:51:03] sort of things. But if in this life only
[1:51:05] we have hope in Christ, we are of all
[1:51:08] men most miserable.
[1:51:11] Isn't that a remarkable statement? Yes.
[1:51:13] If in this life only we have hope in
[1:51:15] Christ, we are of all men most
[1:51:17] miserable. The lack of a future produces
[1:51:19] present misery.
[1:51:22] No matter what's happening now through
[1:51:24] Christ, if it was only the promise of
[1:51:27] this life, he said, then we are
[1:51:29] miserable.
[1:51:31] Of all men most miserable.
[1:51:33] Brother said, I'd be a miserable person
[1:51:35] tonight if I looked around now and seen
[1:51:37] what was going on. But I'm looking for
[1:51:39] him, the author and finisher of the
[1:51:41] faith. Amen.
[1:51:42] Said, "I'd be discouraged tonight if it
[1:51:44] wasn't for that. I'm watching the end.
[1:51:45] Just keeping steady. Move on no matter
[1:51:47] what takes place. Just keep Don't look
[1:51:49] at that. Just keep looking at the end."
[1:51:51] Amen.
[1:51:52] He said, "If I had looked at what was
[1:51:53] going on around me all the time, I might
[1:51:54] stray off the road, too. But I look
[1:51:56] what's at the end. I keep my eye there.
[1:51:58] I have to be steady. I can be say, let
[1:52:00] friends forsake everything else go
[1:52:01] wrong. And people like this, that, or
[1:52:03] the other." I'm looking to the end down
[1:52:05] there.
[1:52:06] Why? Because I'm not a miserable person.
[1:52:08] Because I'm not just living for this
[1:52:10] life. Even my hope in Christ does not
[1:52:12] have any end in this life, but I have a
[1:52:14] life to come.
[1:52:16] Our vision is beyond this life. We have
[1:52:18] a reason to live that is different than
[1:52:20] all others.
[1:52:22] Brother Brandham summarizing this story
[1:52:24] about this young man, this Rome in Rome,
[1:52:27] this artist, and the preaches it again
[1:52:29] and hearing, recognizing, and acting on
[1:52:30] the word of God. Uh just earlier that
[1:52:32] same year, he says that's what makes a
[1:52:34] Christian live different. He is
[1:52:36] different because he's got something to
[1:52:38] live different for.
[1:52:40] You've got something different to live
[1:52:42] for. I know you might rationalize your
[1:52:44] mind. Why do they preach a gospel of
[1:52:45] holiness? Why do they preach a gospel of
[1:52:47] sanctification? Why can't young men do
[1:52:49] this? And why can't young ladies do
[1:52:50] that? Because it's not expedient to the
[1:52:53] goal. It's not going to get us to a
[1:52:54] rapture. It's not going to get us into
[1:52:56] rapturing faith. God knows exactly what
[1:52:58] he's doing.
[1:52:59] Do you realize in the time of the Exodus
[1:53:01] there in Exodus 11, the death angel's
[1:53:03] going to be passing through? And it
[1:53:04] wasn't just, hey, everything's going to
[1:53:06] be fine. Just go on living how you are.
[1:53:07] But no, they had to prepare themselves.
[1:53:09] They had to dress themselves. They had
[1:53:11] to take a lamb of a certain age and they
[1:53:13] had to draw it out and had to kill it.
[1:53:14] They had to cook it a particular way.
[1:53:15] They had to eat all of it. And then they
[1:53:17] had to get all the leaven out of the
[1:53:19] house and they had to take the blood
[1:53:20] applied upon the doorpost and all these
[1:53:22] things were done so that they could
[1:53:24] bypass death and go in an exodus. And we
[1:53:27] might think, well, what's the big deal?
[1:53:28] Why do we have to do this and do that?
[1:53:30] Because there's a consequence to not
[1:53:33] following God's prescription. God wants
[1:53:36] to make a difference. God does not want
[1:53:38] anyone to sit back and say, "Well, it
[1:53:39] was just coincidence they didn't get it.
[1:53:41] It was just coincidence they didn't
[1:53:43] die." You can look and say, "They did
[1:53:44] everything that their Bible told them to
[1:53:46] do and they lived it. Now, where are
[1:53:48] they? What happened?
[1:53:49] Where'd they go?
[1:53:51] Oh, they must be in the Smoky Mountain
[1:53:53] somewhere. They must be in a cult. They
[1:53:54] must have went down into uh Guyana and
[1:53:56] drunk the Kool-Aid or something.
[1:53:58] Come on. Uh cuz they're going to look at
[1:54:00] your life and what you've done and God
[1:54:02] says, "I'm going to put a difference."
[1:54:03] So you walk by an Israelite's house, you
[1:54:05] say, "Yep, that stinks.
[1:54:07] That smells. Look at all that blood.
[1:54:08] Look, they're in there eating with their
[1:54:09] shoes on. They boiled that lamb. That's
[1:54:12] gross, right? They they look at
[1:54:15] everything that's being done. There's a
[1:54:16] difference being made.
[1:54:18] There's a distinction.
[1:54:20] And even to think, you might think,
[1:54:22] well, why why would we have to do this?
[1:54:23] Why is it we have to do this? It's for
[1:54:25] expediency.
[1:54:26] Amen.
[1:54:28] Because we have to put the last enemy
[1:54:29] under our feet which is death. That's
[1:54:31] what makes a Christian live different.
[1:54:33] He is different because he's got
[1:54:34] something to live for.
[1:54:36] In
[1:54:36] the message perseverance he brother says
[1:54:39] now to achieve anything you've got to
[1:54:42] set a goal and say this I believe.
[1:54:46] Amen.
[1:54:47] I want this to be in your heart today.
[1:54:50] This I believe.
[1:54:52] and tie yourself to it and keep drawing,
[1:54:56] moving up closer to it,
[1:54:58] knowing that it's there. Something's
[1:55:00] there that you're coming to.
[1:55:02] Tie yourself to a scripture today
[1:55:04] and say, "This I believe." If you're
[1:55:06] going to achieve anything, you've got to
[1:55:07] set a goal. You have to have an
[1:55:08] objective and say, "This I believe."
[1:55:10] Then tie yourself to it. Keep drawing,
[1:55:12] moving up closer to it. Scripture says,
[1:55:14] "We shall not all sleep, but we shall
[1:55:16] all be changed."
[1:55:18] Amen.
[1:55:18] This I believe. Amen.
[1:55:20] Jesus told her, "Believest thou this? He
[1:55:23] that believeth in his dead shall shall
[1:55:25] shall be raised up, but he that
[1:55:27] believeth in me shall not die." And he's
[1:55:29] talking about a resurrection. He's
[1:55:30] talking about those who will not taste
[1:55:32] death. He says, "Believest thou this?"
[1:55:33] And we should say, "This I believe."
[1:55:36] Amen.
[1:55:40] He said, he says it like a little boy
[1:55:42] with the kite that held a string in his
[1:55:43] hand.
[1:55:45] Old man said, "What are you holding,
[1:55:46] son?" He said, "My kite."
[1:55:49] The old man said, "I don't see nothing
[1:55:50] but a string."
[1:55:52] That's all they see in this message,
[1:55:54] right?
[1:55:55] Just bondage. I don't see nothing but a
[1:55:57] string. He said, "But there's a kite on
[1:55:59] the end of it."
[1:56:01] The man looked up and said, "I don't see
[1:56:02] no kite."
[1:56:04] Little boy said, "Neither do I."
[1:56:07] Well, how do you know you got a kite?
[1:56:09] I can feel it tugging at the end.
[1:56:12] Amen.
[1:56:14] Well, that's the way faith is.
[1:56:15] Hallelujah.
[1:56:16] All they see is a string.
[1:56:18] Come on.
[1:56:18] And you may not even see the kite, but
[1:56:20] you feel it tugging.
[1:56:22] You know there's something beyond that
[1:56:23] veil. You know it's something real. Why?
[1:56:25] You feel it tugging. Just like that
[1:56:27] little dude dropped there quivering in
[1:56:29] the morning. It knows that that
[1:56:31] sunlight's declaring it's going back
[1:56:33] where it came from.
[1:56:35] I could feel it tugging at the end.
[1:56:37] Well, that's the way faith is. Faith is
[1:56:39] the substance of things hoped for, the
[1:56:41] evidence of things not seen. As long as
[1:56:43] you set your faith on it and then anchor
[1:56:45] it, you are coming to it.
[1:56:47] No matter if you can't see it or not,
[1:56:49] you know it's there anyhow. You're
[1:56:51] tugging at it and it's pulling you.
[1:56:53] And any man that's ever done anything
[1:56:56] worthwhile has set a goal and then been
[1:56:59] persistent, persevering to make that
[1:57:01] young people, you don't just have a
[1:57:03] reason to live. You've got a reason to
[1:57:05] live different.
[1:57:06] You can be different than the teenagers.
[1:57:08] You can be different than the adults.
[1:57:09] You can be different than the youth of
[1:57:11] today.
[1:57:13] Not just for no reason. Not just to be
[1:57:15] eclectic.
[1:57:17] Not just to fit in.
[1:57:18] Come on.
[1:57:20] This world is getting so weird that, you
[1:57:21] know, anybody can get fit into
[1:57:24] something.
[1:57:25] Yeah.
[1:57:25] We're not doing it for a following.
[1:57:28] We're not doing it for views. We're not
[1:57:29] doing it so we can monetize our
[1:57:30] accounts.
[1:57:35] We live different because we got a we
[1:57:36] got a reason. Yes.
[1:57:38] Amen.
[1:57:40] I'll say I want to close. Whatever your
[1:57:43] whatever your need is, find your answer
[1:57:46] in the word
[1:57:47] and
[1:57:48] tie yourself to it.
[1:57:53] On the day of Pentecost, Peter said,
[1:57:54] they said, "What can we do to be saved?"
[1:57:55] He said, "Repent.
[1:57:57] Be baptized every one of you in the name
[1:57:58] of Jesus Christ for the remission of
[1:57:59] sins, and you shall receive the gift of
[1:58:01] the Holy Ghost."
[1:58:02] If you've never been born again, tie
[1:58:04] yourself to that scripture.
[1:58:05] Yeah. Amen. Tie yourself to it. You've
[1:58:07] never repented, repent.
[1:58:10] If you can repent knowing your sins are
[1:58:11] forgiven, get baptized in the name of
[1:58:12] Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:58:13] I said if you know it, if you've
[1:58:15] repented and you have a clean heart and
[1:58:17] even this week and you poured your heart
[1:58:18] out to God and you've repented and
[1:58:19] you've changed your mind, don't delay
[1:58:20] the water.
[1:58:22] According to the Bible, it was
[1:58:22] immediate.
[1:58:24] I I think it's hot enough in here that
[1:58:26] if there's a baptismal, the water's got
[1:58:28] to be 80 degrees, right?
[1:58:31] No, it's not going to be it shouldn't be
[1:58:32] cold
[1:58:33] there. You should be do walk keep the
[1:58:36] word of God. Walk in it. Tie yourself to
[1:58:38] it.
[1:58:38] I read in the beginning, nothing is
[1:58:40] going to stop a man when he's
[1:58:41] perseverant. When he knows what he is
[1:58:43] doing and got faith in what he's trying
[1:58:44] to achieve.
[1:58:47] Young people, you have a reason.
[1:58:49] That's what makes Christians live
[1:58:50] different. He's different because he's
[1:58:52] got something to live different for.
[1:58:54] And brother Bham says that when he talks
[1:58:56] about the land beyond the river,
[1:58:59] you're not living different for your
[1:59:00] pastor.
[1:59:01] You're not living different for your
[1:59:02] church. You're not living different for
[1:59:04] the message.
[1:59:06] You're not living different for
[1:59:07] prestige.
[1:59:09] You're living different because where
[1:59:10] you're going.
[1:59:11] I have a reason to live different
[1:59:13] because I have a painful desire for a
[1:59:15] new body. I have a reason to live
[1:59:17] different because I don't want this life
[1:59:18] to be my ultimate. I'm living for a life
[1:59:21] to come. Therefore, you can have
[1:59:23] deliberate faith.
[1:59:25] And with a deliberate faith, it's
[1:59:26] declared faith.
[1:59:28] And through the declaration of faith, it
[1:59:30] becomes a distinguished faith. Amen.
[1:59:32] A reason to live different.
[1:59:34] Yes.
[1:59:35] Let's stand.
[1:59:37] Hallelujah.
[1:59:46] A reason
[1:59:48] to live different.
[1:59:55] God help us today.
[1:59:58] Trust the musicians could come now.
[2:00:03] Can you set a goal, young people?
[2:00:05] Amen.
[2:00:06] Is there a goal you can set in your
[2:00:07] heart? Now, set the rapture as your
[2:00:09] goal. There's consequences.
[2:00:11] Sell out to it. I just love the domino
[2:00:14] effect. If you really mean it in your
[2:00:15] heart right now, the rapture is my goal.
[2:00:17] And just let that reverberate.
[2:00:20] Let that just strike your heart to open
[2:00:21] up to you the consequence of a decision
[2:00:24] such as that. Say, Lord, I want my heart
[2:00:26] right. How am I going to make a rapture?
[2:00:28] Lord, just walk with me daily.
[2:00:31] Daily in the scripture, daily in the
[2:00:33] word, and that's how the change will
[2:00:35] come
[2:00:37] with your heads bowed.
[2:00:40] I'd like to sing the song. I think it's
[2:00:41] in the key of G the potter's hand.
[2:00:43] Beautiful Lord, wonderful Savior.
[2:00:53] Set a goal, young people.
[2:00:57] Let's bow our heads
[2:01:00] as you search your heart.
[2:01:04] Maybe there's a scripture that comes to
[2:01:06] mind. Maybe there's a need that comes to
[2:01:07] mind.
[2:01:09] And you could just say, "I'm going to
[2:01:11] set this goal.
[2:01:16] I'm going to tie myself to it,
[2:01:19] pull at it,
[2:01:21] and see if it doesn't pull back."
[2:01:24] And maybe you could now just as a
[2:01:26] response to the word of God. If you have
[2:01:27] a a promise that you want to bring
[2:01:30] before the Lord that you're tying
[2:01:31] yourself to and you just lift your hand
[2:01:33] and declare your faith. Lord, I believe
[2:01:37] this. I believe
[2:01:39] I tie myself to it.
[2:01:43] I'm coming to it. Lord,
[2:01:47] set a goal.
[2:01:50] I have a reason to live different. Our
[2:01:53] gracious heavenly father, as we've
[2:01:54] raised our hands in response to your
[2:01:56] word,
[2:01:57] Lord, it's us tugging, tugging at that
[2:02:00] string. Lord, I pray that these young
[2:02:02] people would know beyond a shadow of a
[2:02:04] doubt that there is a land beyond the
[2:02:06] river.
[2:02:07] Just as that young man could go over to
[2:02:09] Rome and live a clean life, sanctified
[2:02:11] in the presence of all the filth and
[2:02:12] temptations.
[2:02:14] Lord, we realize that young ladies don't
[2:02:16] have to go out to the street corner to
[2:02:17] sell their bodies. They can give their
[2:02:19] virtue away in the privacy of their
[2:02:20] room. Young men don't have to go out to
[2:02:22] the markets to find the filth. They can
[2:02:24] do it in the privacy of their room.
[2:02:26] There's so many ways we can defile our
[2:02:27] spirits and erode our confidence and
[2:02:29] cause our minds to be encumbered with so
[2:02:32] many vile things.
[2:02:34] Lord, we're here in our Rome. We're in
[2:02:36] the Babylon.
[2:02:38] But the reason why we can live different
[2:02:40] is because there's one who died for me.
[2:02:41] There's a one that purchased my
[2:02:43] salvation. It's become real to me. It's
[2:02:45] become evident to me. And I will live as
[2:02:48] a Christian will live. I'll live as a
[2:02:49] gentleman ought to live. I'll live like
[2:02:51] a lady ought to live. Not just because
[2:02:53] these are rules and of dos and don'ts,
[2:02:54] but because you want to put a difference
[2:02:56] between me and the world. And that
[2:02:58] difference isn't just for this life.
[2:03:00] It's for the life which is to come.
[2:03:02] Because there is going to come a moment
[2:03:03] when I shall be changed.
[2:03:06] Lord, I'm living for the day that will
[2:03:08] come when we'll meet you in the air.
[2:03:10] Lord, I'm living for the time when this
[2:03:12] body will be changed and death will be
[2:03:14] placed under my feet. immortality will
[2:03:17] be swallowed up by immortality. Lord,
[2:03:19] I'm not living for a grave. I'm living
[2:03:21] for a a graduation. Lord,
[2:03:26] I'm living for this translation.
[2:03:30] Lord, with that goal in mind and view, I
[2:03:32] realize, Lord, if I'm ever going to
[2:03:34] taste the rapture, I've got to taste
[2:03:36] salvation.
[2:03:38] And Lord, I commit my heart to you. I
[2:03:40] pledge my life to you. I turn my eyes
[2:03:43] away from all these evil things, Lord.
[2:03:45] Even these innocent things that just
[2:03:46] dominate my thoughts and my time, Lord.
[2:03:48] I want to sanctify my mind. Sanctify my
[2:03:50] heart. I want to be more diligent to
[2:03:52] pursue truth and get into the word of
[2:03:54] God and pray and read my Bible. Make
[2:03:57] myself available to serve in our my
[2:03:59] church. Lord,
[2:04:01] I want to give myself to these things
[2:04:04] because I'm living to leave, Lord. And I
[2:04:07] pray Lord my prayer as a minister
[2:04:09] through the length of this, the breadth
[2:04:10] of it, maybe the density of it, Lord,
[2:04:13] may they just leave with a reason to
[2:04:15] live different.
[2:04:18] [Music]
[2:04:19] And may they may it become real to them.
[2:04:21] I pray in Jesus name.
[2:04:24] Amen.
[2:04:27] and beautiful Lord,
[2:04:32] wonderful Savior,
[2:04:35] I know for sure
[2:04:39] all of my days are held in your hands,
[2:04:46] crafted into
[2:04:49] your perfect
[2:04:53] plan.
[2:04:56] and you gently call me
[2:05:01] into your presence.
[2:05:04] Guide me by
[2:05:08] your Holy Spirit.
[2:05:10] [Applause]
[2:05:11] Teach me, dear Lord,
[2:05:14] to live all of my life
[2:05:18] through
[2:05:20] your
[2:05:22] eyes.
[2:05:25] and I'm captured by
[2:05:29] your holy calling.
[2:05:33] Set me aart.
[2:05:36] I'm lowing
[2:05:39] me to yourself.
[2:05:43] Lead me, Lord, I pray.
[2:05:49] [Music]
[2:05:52] Oh, and take me,
[2:05:57] hold me,
[2:06:01] give me,
[2:06:04] fill me.
[2:06:07] I give my life
[2:06:10] to the potter's
[2:06:14] hand.
[2:06:18] Call me.
[2:06:21] Guide me.
[2:06:24] Oh, lead me. Walk beside
[2:06:29] me.
[2:06:30] I give my life
[2:06:34] to the potter's
[2:06:37] hand.
[2:06:40] You gently call me.
[2:06:42] Oh, and you gently call. He's a
[2:06:46] gentleman.
[2:06:48] He's just wooing you now.
[2:06:51] Guiding me by
[2:06:54] your Holy Spirit.
[2:06:56] [Applause]
[2:06:58] Teach me, dear Lord,
[2:07:01] to live all of my life
[2:07:04] through
[2:07:06] your
[2:07:11] I'm captured by
[2:07:14] your holy gra.
[2:07:17] Oh, set me aart.
[2:07:21] I know you're drawing
[2:07:24] me to yourself.
[2:07:28] Oh, lead me Lord I pray.
[2:07:35] [Music]
[2:07:36] Oh, and take me
[2:07:42] for me.
[2:07:45] Give me,
[2:07:48] fill me.
[2:07:51] I give my life
[2:07:54] to the potter's
[2:07:58] hand.
[2:08:01] Call me.
[2:08:04] Guide me. Oh, lead me. Walk beside
[2:08:12] me.
[2:08:14] I give my life
[2:08:17] to the potters
[2:08:20] and take me, hold me, use me, fill me.
[2:08:26] Oh, and take me, take me,
[2:08:32] hold me, use me,
[2:08:37] build me.
[2:08:40] I give my life
[2:08:43] to the father's
[2:08:46] hand.
[2:08:53] Call me. Call me.
[2:08:58] Guide me and lead me. Walk beside me.
[2:09:06] I give my life
[2:09:09] to the heart.
[2:09:12] [Music]
[2:09:18] Let the worippers arise.
[2:09:23] [Music]
[2:09:26] Let the suns and the dark.
[2:09:29] [Music]
[2:09:33] I surrendering my all.
[2:09:39] [Music]
[2:09:40] I surrender to the king.
[2:09:46] Oh, let the worippers arise.
[2:09:54] Let your son
[2:09:56] see.
[2:10:00] Oh, I'm surrendering my
[2:10:08] I surrender to the king.
[2:10:13] Oh,
[2:10:15] and the woripper.
[2:10:18] The bright
[2:10:20] is risen.
[2:10:22] Let the darkness
[2:10:29] I surrender
[2:10:31] my
[2:10:36] I
[2:10:38] a little bit louder now. Let the
[2:10:39] worippers rise.
[2:10:42] Oh,
[2:10:57] I'm surrendering my heart.
[2:11:04] I surrender to the king.
[2:11:08] Let's sing that first verse.
[2:11:12] Father, I see that you are drawing
[2:11:16] the line.
[2:11:19] I want to be stand by your side.
[2:11:24] Holding your hand,
[2:11:27] your kingom come
[2:11:31] in.
[2:11:33] This is my way.
[2:11:36] This is my
[2:11:48] [Music]
[2:11:53] surrender.
[2:11:57] [Music]
[2:12:00] I
[2:12:02] sing it again. Hallelujah.
[2:12:04] Let the worst.
[2:12:12] [Music]
[2:12:21] I'm surrendering my own.
[2:12:26] [Applause]
[2:12:28] I surrender to the king. Father, I see
[2:12:32] the bride adorning.
[2:12:36] Father, I see the bride adorning
[2:12:40] in the word of King. Jesus rising down
[2:12:46] power.
[2:12:47] She's anointed
[2:12:50] for the season now.
[2:12:54] The last
[2:12:57] is our song.
[2:13:01] Heat. Heat.
[2:13:12] [Music]
[2:13:17] I surrender my
[2:13:21] [Music]
[2:13:24] surrender to let the worship.
[2:13:28] Hallelujah.
[2:13:35] [Applause]
[2:13:38] The sound
[2:13:40] [Music]
[2:13:44] I'm surrendering
[2:13:46] my
[2:13:52] surrender to the king.
[2:13:56] All right, I want to sing this that that
[2:13:58] I see the bride adorning. Who wrote
[2:13:59] that?
[2:14:00] We don't know who wrote it. Okay, I I
[2:14:02] wrote it. I mean, nobody going to take
[2:14:04] credit for it. I didn't invent it. I
[2:14:06] just discovered it.
[2:14:08] But this is the true song of the
[2:14:10] redeemed in this hour.
[2:14:12] This seventh seal that brings Christ
[2:14:14] back down to earth. This invisible union
[2:14:16] with the bride of Christ. But everybody
[2:14:17] says and under that seal everything is
[2:14:19] worship.
[2:14:21] This is when there's worship in spirit
[2:14:23] and truth.
[2:14:24] This is this is you. This is a time when
[2:14:27] you recognize these things. This is
[2:14:29] where there's true jubilee. There's true
[2:14:31] worship in the light of this. Not a
[2:14:32] glare of another age. Not trying to pump
[2:14:34] something up. But when you see yourself
[2:14:36] in the word of God, that relieves the
[2:14:39] anxiety. John wept a depressed soul when
[2:14:43] the book was sealed. But once it was
[2:14:45] open, he saw himself in it and he got
[2:14:47] all happy and everyone heard him.
[2:14:51] John, I John declaring and crying out. I
[2:14:54] said, "Leave this meeting with a
[2:14:56] distinguished faith, a declared faith, a
[2:14:59] deliberate faith.
[2:15:02] I see the bride
[2:15:05] I see the bride adorning
[2:15:08] in the word of her king
[2:15:12] rising now in power.
[2:15:15] She's anointed to sing for the seals of
[2:15:20] heaven open
[2:15:23] great mysteries. This is our song.
[2:15:31] Let the woring.
[2:15:50] [Applause]
[2:15:53] Let's put our hands up and sing it. Just
[2:15:55] lift your hands and sing it. Come on,
[2:15:57] worship him. Oh,
[2:16:06] [Music]
[2:16:16] [Applause]
[2:16:16] [Music]
[2:16:20] I surrender.
[2:16:23] Father, I hear it growing louder. Let's
[2:16:25] sing that verse now. Oh father, I hear
[2:16:30] it growing louder.
[2:16:32] The song of your redeemer as the bride
[2:16:37] of every nation
[2:16:39] is awakening to sing. And from my heart
[2:16:44] there comes an anthem.
[2:16:47] Oh, hear the praises ring. This is our
[2:16:51] song.
[2:16:52] A song to the king.
[2:16:55] Let the worshippers arise.
[2:17:00] Oh,
[2:17:02] let the sons and the daughter see.
[2:17:08] Oh, I'm surrendering
[2:17:11] my own
[2:17:14] my
[2:17:16] surrender to the king.
[2:17:22] Oh,
[2:17:23] and the worippers arrive
[2:17:28] only now. Let the sons and the daughters
[2:17:32] see.
[2:17:37] I'm surrendering
[2:17:39] my own.
[2:17:42] My own. I surrender to Oh, that sounds
[2:17:46] good. Let's sing that first verse now.
[2:17:50] Father, I see that you're drawing.
[2:17:52] Father, I see that you are drawing
[2:17:56] a line in the sand. I want to be
[2:18:00] standing on your side.
[2:18:03] Is that your prayer? Say, Lord, that's
[2:18:05] where I want to be. Let your kingom
[2:18:08] come. Let it live.
[2:18:13] This is my prayer. Oh, lift those hands
[2:18:16] as you sing it. Raise those hands up and
[2:18:19] sing.
[2:18:21] Arise.
[2:18:26] Let the sons and the daughters see.
[2:18:32] Oh, I'm surrendering
[2:18:35] my own.
[2:18:39] Oh, I surrender to the king.
[2:18:44] Let the woripper.
[2:18:46] Oh, let the worippers arise.
[2:18:51] [Music]
[2:18:53] Oh, let the sons and the daughters see.
[2:18:58] Oh, yeah.
[2:19:01] I'm surrendering
[2:19:03] my own.
[2:19:08] I'm surrender to
[2:19:11] the king.
[2:19:15] [Music]
[2:19:20] Hallelujah.
[2:19:24] Oh, give him a praise offering. Say,
[2:19:26] Lord, you're worthy.
[2:19:28] This is my song.
[2:19:31] Hallelujah. It's the song of the
[2:19:33] redeemed.
[2:19:35] Oh, young people. How many can say, I
[2:19:37] want to be. I want to identify. I'm
[2:19:40] going to identify myself. This is my
[2:19:43] song.
[2:19:44] Give me that last verse, brother George.
[2:19:48] One, Brother Aaron. Did you write that,
[2:19:50] brother? And you said or no, you just
[2:19:51] found it. That last one.
[2:19:54] Father, I see the bride adorning. Are
[2:19:57] you Is that what you're doing? You heard
[2:19:59] the word of God. It didn't just go in
[2:20:00] your ear and out the other, but you wore
[2:20:03] it. You You heard that message. I'm
[2:20:04] going to take that mantle. Oh, how many
[2:20:07] can say that? Say, "Lord, I I'm
[2:20:09] accepting that mantle that's came upon
[2:20:11] me. Yeah.
[2:20:13] I'm rising now in power.
[2:20:15] I'm anointed.
[2:20:17] Do you know you're anointed? Whether you
[2:20:20] feel like it or not, there's an
[2:20:22] anointing upon a supernatural anointing
[2:20:25] upon your life.
[2:20:28] For the seals have now been opened.
[2:20:30] The last great mysteries. This is our
[2:20:34] song. And it's a different song than the
[2:20:37] rest of the world is singing.
[2:20:40] Listen, young people. The song that you
[2:20:42] sing is not the same song that they're
[2:20:45] singing down at the Baptist church. It's
[2:20:47] not the same song they're singing at the
[2:20:49] non-denominational church. That church
[2:20:52] has their place, but it's a different
[2:20:54] calling that you're called to. I hope
[2:20:57] you heard the message to today. I heard
[2:20:59] you heard it through the entire re the
[2:21:01] entire weekend. I wish I had brother
[2:21:03] Aaron's titles here to to read all all
[2:21:05] three of them that he spoke on, but it
[2:21:07] was a deliberate a reason, a purpose.
[2:21:12] a purpose that you have, a specific
[2:21:15] message that God has given you in this
[2:21:18] generation. And boy, I identify so much
[2:21:21] with what you said, brother Aaron. If
[2:21:23] there's anything we could accomplish,
[2:21:25] there's anything we could accomplish is
[2:21:27] to push you further than we've ever gone
[2:21:30] to get to let you come under a stronger
[2:21:32] anointing than we've ever experienced, a
[2:21:35] greater revelation. Oh, how many hearts
[2:21:37] could say, "I want that today. want that
[2:21:40] for myself. I I've I'm I'm called to be
[2:21:43] different. You know, brother Brandon
[2:21:44] made that statement in the token and he
[2:21:47] said the token is what made the
[2:21:50] difference.
[2:21:52] God put a difference and he said the
[2:21:55] token is what made
[2:21:58] the difference.
[2:22:02] Not a doctrine.
[2:22:04] Remember, a doctrine didn't die for you.
[2:22:07] not a teaching or just a mental
[2:22:09] intellectual understanding of we got
[2:22:11] better doctrine. Is that why we're
[2:22:12] different? We just understand things
[2:22:14] better than somebody else. It's not what
[2:22:15] it's about at all. It's a completely
[2:22:18] different calling in your life. When
[2:22:22] you're called, the bride is the highest
[2:22:26] calling you could receive.
[2:22:29] Higher than any prophet calling, higher
[2:22:31] than a minister's calling, higher than
[2:22:33] any other calling. to be called the
[2:22:35] bride of Jesus Christ. Friends, let me
[2:22:39] just ask you and invite you here to bow
[2:22:41] your heads with me. Every head bowed,
[2:22:43] every eye closed,
[2:22:49] nobody looking around.
[2:22:53] Felt led to do this. I know it's Sunday.
[2:22:56] We had a powerful service Friday. We had
[2:22:58] a powerful service Saturday. Believe
[2:23:02] lives were changed.
[2:23:05] believe hearts were made whole.
[2:23:09] But here we are now at the conclusion,
[2:23:12] the last service, last moment. Here we
[2:23:16] are in this atmosphere.
[2:23:19] The presence that you felt while we're
[2:23:21] singing that song, while the preaching
[2:23:23] of the word was going forth,
[2:23:26] there's something pulling you, young
[2:23:29] person.
[2:23:30] There's a kite
[2:23:33] on the other end of that string.
[2:23:35] And maybe you recognize it here tonight.
[2:23:38] I'm called to be different, not the
[2:23:41] same.
[2:23:44] God's called me to walk differently.
[2:23:46] Called Enoch to walk differently.
[2:23:49] And God's called you to that walk. I I
[2:23:51] want to just close conclude this this
[2:23:54] meeting with a an invitation to this
[2:23:57] altar.
[2:23:58] felt led of the Holy Spirit to do it. I
[2:24:01] know the Lord was moving on hearts and
[2:24:04] moving on lives. But I want to give you
[2:24:07] an opportunity. I would be remiss if I
[2:24:09] didn't
[2:24:11] take this moment, this opportunity as
[2:24:13] God was pricking hearts
[2:24:16] and God was speaking to you, coming
[2:24:18] right down to your aisle. Now listen,
[2:24:21] Brother Aaron spoke last night and he
[2:24:24] you you'll recall he began to tell the
[2:24:26] story of that little baby. in ICU and
[2:24:29] those doctors
[2:24:31] crying out saying, "Declare yourself."
[2:24:34] You know, brother Aaron said he had
[2:24:36] written that down in his notes years
[2:24:37] ago. Years ago, he'd written that down
[2:24:40] in his notes and and and just didn't
[2:24:42] have an uncction to minister it.
[2:24:44] Ministered and preached it for the first
[2:24:46] time in the pullpit here last night.
[2:24:48] Declare yourself. This morning, he
[2:24:50] looked at his notes back when the Lord
[2:24:53] inspired him with that. It was six years
[2:24:55] ago on May 13th.
[2:24:59] Six years to the day God inspired
[2:25:02] brother Aaron and now he stood in the
[2:25:04] pull pit. And I believe it was an
[2:25:06] anointed word. And I just want to invite
[2:25:09] you here today. Listen, I don't care if
[2:25:11] you got a boy that likes you here, a
[2:25:13] girl that likes you here, and you got a
[2:25:14] boyfriend, a girlfriend, there's mom and
[2:25:16] dad here, parents looking around.
[2:25:18] Listen, don't let anything hinder you or
[2:25:20] stop you. This is your moment. This is
[2:25:22] your chance. Brother Barham tells the
[2:25:25] story of a girl and he he comes to that
[2:25:27] girl in the service and the Lord had
[2:25:29] revealed to him and said, "Sister,
[2:25:31] tonight God's calling you tonight."
[2:25:35] That means there was a specific moment,
[2:25:38] a specific time the Lord came knocking
[2:25:41] on her heart.
[2:25:43] And brother Brandham says, "Sister,
[2:25:44] God's calling you tonight, but because
[2:25:46] of shame, because of embarrassment,
[2:25:48] because of maybe awkwardness or
[2:25:50] pressure, you know, there's something
[2:25:52] powerful when you leave your seat. It's
[2:25:54] wonderful to raise your hands and accept
[2:25:56] it at your seat. There's something when
[2:25:58] you defy and you when you defy
[2:26:01] embarrassment and awkwardness and you
[2:26:04] you come out here and you step out from
[2:26:06] your seat and you stand at this altar
[2:26:08] and you have a specific request, you
[2:26:10] want to be prayed for. I can tell you
[2:26:12] what, God honors that. Satan hates it.
[2:26:15] The kingdom of hell fights against it,
[2:26:17] but God still uses it to fill people
[2:26:20] with the baptism of the Holy Ghost.
[2:26:23] And that sister refused to prophet said,
[2:26:25] "No." And and left the building, Brother
[2:26:27] Brandham Caesar, years later, drunk,
[2:26:29] alcoholic, offering him offering
[2:26:32] offering him a cigarette. And she said,
[2:26:35] she said, "Brother Brandham, since that
[2:26:36] day that I rejected that call, my life
[2:26:38] been my life has been so dark, so
[2:26:41] black." He said, she said, "I've been so
[2:26:43] distant from God. I can see my mother's
[2:26:45] hell frying and he says, I could see my
[2:26:48] mother's soul frying in hell like a
[2:26:49] pancake, and I would laugh at it. Her
[2:26:52] soul had became so dark."
[2:26:54] Friend, don't miss this opportunity
[2:26:57] that God's given you right now.
[2:27:01] I want you to every head bowed, every
[2:27:02] eye closed. Healing is here. I believe
[2:27:05] it. I want you to play that for me,
[2:27:06] Sister Deborah.
[2:27:12] Brother Baron ends that service
[2:27:17] and he says, "Let's go home on the wings
[2:27:20] of a dove.
[2:27:22] Let's be the bride.
[2:27:24] Raise up from your seat now. If you're
[2:27:27] wrong, come here and stand here at the
[2:27:30] altar and say, "I've been wrong, Brother
[2:27:32] Brandon. I'm I've got a temper. I've
[2:27:34] lived ungodly. I've done things I
[2:27:36] shouldn't have done. I've lived I'm
[2:27:37] guilty of this. I'm I I haven't served
[2:27:40] God the way that I should, and I'm
[2:27:41] ashamed of myself, and I want my life
[2:27:45] made right. Won't you pray for me here,
[2:27:47] Brother Brandham? I'll be glad to do
[2:27:49] it." I want you to invite you now. Here,
[2:27:51] if you're going to come to this altar,
[2:27:53] stand in a line. will make a line going
[2:27:54] all the way out the door. And get
[2:27:56] Brother Aaron if you could.
[2:27:59] He says, "I want my life to be made
[2:28:01] right. Won't you pray for me?" If God
[2:28:03] will answer my prayer to heal the sick,
[2:28:05] blind, and afflicted, he'll certainly
[2:28:07] hear a prayer for the sinner. Won't you
[2:28:09] come and be part of the bride tonight? I
[2:28:13] invite you to come
[2:28:16] as these that are coming. Brother
[2:28:19] Brandham says, "Thank you. I admire that
[2:28:21] kind of courage that'll walk out and
[2:28:24] admit you're wrong. God bless you. Stand
[2:28:27] right here. Oh, you those of you that
[2:28:30] have hand raised and you're raising your
[2:28:32] hand. Brother Brandham says, "You mean
[2:28:33] to tell me you could raise up your hand
[2:28:35] and not be sincere? What's happened?
[2:28:37] What's the matter with our people in
[2:28:38] this day? You mean you'd raise up your
[2:28:40] hand and say that you were wrong and you
[2:28:41] won't come to this altar?
[2:28:44] He that knoweth to do good and doeth it
[2:28:46] not to him it's evil. Won't you come
[2:28:49] while the pianist
[2:28:52] sister is playing? I'm inviting you. I
[2:28:55] want to ask you.
[2:28:58] I'm inviting you to come.
[2:29:02] Now, don't turn down. That's a special
[2:29:04] invitation God makes. We're going to
[2:29:06] baptize. We got a baptismal pool.
[2:29:08] They're going to fill up. There's
[2:29:09] already one person, sister, wanting to
[2:29:10] be baptized. We'll make that invitation.
[2:29:13] We'll have the water. You can come and
[2:29:15] make a difference. God God can come and
[2:29:17] make a difference in your life. You
[2:29:19] heard about it today, young people, a
[2:29:21] deliberate faith, a deliberate purpose.
[2:29:27] So be deliberate about it tonight. I
[2:29:29] want to invite you as brother Aaron was
[2:29:31] inspired. Let me just repreach it here
[2:29:33] today. Declare yourself this morning.
[2:29:37] You can you declare that there's a
[2:29:38] desire, something inside of you that
[2:29:40] could say, "Lord, I want to be changed
[2:29:42] from the inside out. I want to be a new
[2:29:45] creature in Christ Jesus. I came to this
[2:29:48] weekend with an expectation. And you
[2:29:50] came with the word and met that
[2:29:51] expectation. And now I'm going to
[2:29:53] respond and declare myself. I'm going to
[2:29:56] walk out of this my seat, stand in this
[2:29:58] altar. I'm going to raise my hand and
[2:30:00] say, "Lord, I'm declaring myself. I want
[2:30:02] to live. I want to live for you, Lord
[2:30:05] Jesus. I want to be pulled. I want my
[2:30:07] life to be in I want the life on the
[2:30:09] other side to impose itself upon me here
[2:30:11] today in my life.
[2:30:14] Healing
[2:30:15] is here.
[2:30:19] As you come sing it now,
[2:30:22] healing is he.
[2:30:29] Oh, healing
[2:30:31] is he.
[2:30:36] I receive and I receive it.
[2:30:45] Oh, healing is here.

[2:52:15] and he healed his people.
[2:52:17] And I'm one of those recipients. I'm
[2:52:19] going to testify. Amen. In this meeting,

[2:52:23] young person would not be ashamed to
[2:52:25] say, "Lord, I've been a recipient of
[2:52:27] your healing grace
[2:52:29] through the ministering of your word,
[2:52:30] through the atmosphere of the songs,
[2:52:33] through the fellowship of believers.
[2:52:34] I've been touched this weekend." And I

[2:53:12] Amen. You know, we disappoint each
[2:53:15] other,
[2:53:16] but the Lord never disappoints us.
[2:53:20] Bible says it this way. Even in all the
[2:53:22] times we've been unfaithful, yet he
[2:53:25] remainth faithful to us. Even though you
[2:53:29] might have done nothing this weekend,
[2:53:31] you might have done no preparation.
[2:53:33] Maybe you were caught up in something
[2:53:34] and just caught up in the moment of
[2:53:36] another youth meeting. But God was
[2:53:38] faithful. He came to your seat. He came
[2:53:40] to your heart and he spoke to you. Now,
[2:53:44] it's up to you to receive what he said.
[2:53:46] And I just want to say, Lord, I receive
[2:53:48] everything that was said this weekend.
[2:53:50] You burdened the heart of a minister and
[2:53:53] he delivered his heart. And I receive it
[2:53:55] today, Lord Jesus. I'm going to take
[2:53:57] these things that I've heard. There's
[2:53:59] been substance, real substance that you
[2:54:01] could take home and fight the devil with
[2:54:03] on Monday.
[2:54:05] Amen. Fight him with on Tuesday. Not
[2:54:07] just to the next youth meeting. You
[2:54:09] could take what you heard this weekend
[2:54:10] and stand as a different person today.
[2:54:14] You might lose some battles. I was hear
[2:54:16] brother Brandham say it this morning. He
[2:54:18] said, "I might lose some battles,
[2:54:21] but I'll win the war."
[2:54:25] Might have lose some battles, friends,
[2:54:26] but we're going to win this war.
[2:54:28] We've been called to it. Amen. We're
[2:54:31] going to let you go. Be dismissed. Amen.
[2:54:33] Just want to say again how wonderful
[2:54:35] it's been. Thank you for all of those
[2:54:37] that traveled here and came and been
[2:54:39] part of these meetings. My I certainly
[2:54:41] just was enjoying the day we had
[2:54:43] yesterday fellowship, getting to meet
[2:54:45] some of you. Amen. Some of you that
[2:54:47] we've known for years, some maybe your
[2:54:49] first time here and never didn't get a
[2:54:51] chance to shake your hand. Well, I just
[2:54:52] want to say God bless you. Amen. And
[2:54:54] thank you for coming. If the Lord
[2:54:56] carries, we'll be having our youth camp
[2:54:58] same weekend uh this year uh Halloween
[2:55:01] weekend. And so, we'll be looking
[2:55:03] forward in prayer for that. Amen. Are
[2:55:06] you are you just so grateful that it
[2:55:08] just gets better and better and better
[2:55:10] and better? You know, the word doesn't
[2:55:12] get stale. It doesn't get stagnant. It
[2:55:14] just gets better and better and better.
[2:55:16] And I want to say, Lord, I want more of
[2:55:18] it. Keep filling me up till I'm
[2:55:20] overflowing. Keep filling me up, Lord
[2:55:23] Jesus. Keep pouring it in my soul. Keep
[2:55:27] dumping it in, Lord. I'll receive it.
[2:55:30] Hallelujah. Let my life overflow.
[2:55:35] Glory.
[2:55:37] Amen. We're going to have a baptism.
[2:55:38] It's going to be at 3:30. If you would
[2:55:40] like to be baptized and take the names,
[2:55:42] take the name of the Lord in Christian
[2:55:44] baptism. We have a pool right here,
[2:55:46] right under this stage. Little trap
[2:55:48] door. If I hit a button here, they'll
[2:55:49] all fall in it. But we use it also for a
[2:55:51] baptismal.
[2:55:54] So, uh, so that'll be at 3:30 and the
[2:55:57] water will be nice and warm for you. It
[2:55:59] won't be cold. I don't think we even got
[2:56:01] to warm it with this weather outside,
[2:56:03] but at 3:30, there's already one I know
[2:56:05] of that wants to be baptized. You want
[2:56:07] to be baptized, go see one of the
[2:56:09] ministers, Brother Brad Y, there in the
[2:56:11] back. Just let him know. He'll make sure
[2:56:13] of that. At 3:30, we'll be doing that.
[2:56:15] There is a meal and things afterwards
[2:56:17] and fellowship that we'll we have ready
[2:56:19] and waiting for you. So, let's just bow
[2:56:21] our heads as we just close the service,
[2:56:24] these meetings. Lord, we just stand in
[2:56:26] awe in all of you, Lord. Our hearts are
[2:56:31] captured by this holy calling.
[2:56:35] We feel that drawing power, Lord, and we
[2:56:38] respond.
[2:56:40] We hear the word of God that says,
[2:56:41] "Declare yourself." And we've responded
[2:56:45] to your call, Lord Jesus. There's been
[2:56:47] hearts that responded to that call. And
[2:56:50] we say by uplifted hands, "Call me, draw
[2:56:53] me, lead me, guide me, fill me, use me,
[2:56:57] Lord Jesus. That's my prayer, oh God. I
[2:57:00] pray that every person here, every young
[2:57:02] and old that's in this building, that's
[2:57:04] outside in the fellowship hall that's
[2:57:06] walking around the grounds. I pray
[2:57:08] there'd be a surrendered heart to say,
[2:57:10] "Lord, would you call me and lead me and
[2:57:12] guide me and fill me and use me, Lord? I
[2:57:15] want to be caught up in this holy
[2:57:17] calling that's taking place where a a
[2:57:20] groom is calling to her to his bride."
[2:57:24] And we're making ourselves ready, Lord,
[2:57:26] by the preparation of the gospel that we
[2:57:28] heard this weekend. We take it into our
[2:57:30] hearts. We raise our hands. We say we
[2:57:33] receive it. We surrender to it, Lord
[2:57:35] God. Let it not just be seed that falls
[2:57:38] amongst wayside and falls amongst thorny
[2:57:40] and stony ground, Lord. But I raise my
[2:57:43] hand and say, let the word fall into the
[2:57:45] good ground of my heart and let it bring
[2:57:48] forth a harvest.
[2:57:51] Grant it, Lord, to each person, each
[2:57:53] mother and each father, each young
[2:57:55] person and old. I pray that you would
[2:57:58] just answer every request and every
[2:58:01] heart that's been put forth here and the
[2:58:03] burdens that have been brought this
[2:58:05] weekend. We give you thanks for it, Lord
[2:58:07] Jesus, for your worthy of our praise.
[2:58:11] Take us from here, Lord, but not from
[2:58:13] your presence. I pray that you would
[2:58:14] bless Brother Aaron, Sister Elizabeth.
[2:58:17] We just lift our voices now and say,
[2:58:19] "God, would you bless Brother Aaron?
[2:58:21] Would you pour out a blessing upon his
[2:58:23] entire family, his church back home? May
[2:58:26] you refill, may you refresh, may you
[2:58:29] rejuvenate, God. May a strength come
[2:58:31] upon Brother Aaron, Sister Elizabeth,
[2:58:33] and their whole family for pouring out
[2:58:35] their hearts this weekend. I pray God a
[2:58:37] special blessing upon them and all those
[2:58:39] that have worked and gathered and
[2:58:41] labored in this meeting. We give you
[2:58:44] thanks for a family, the body of Christ.
[2:58:46] Where would we be, Lord, without each
[2:58:48] other? But Lord, most of all, where
[2:58:51] would we be without you? Thank you for
[2:58:53] your divine presence that came and met
[2:58:55] us here in every service. I pray God
[2:58:58] that you would take us, keep us, Lord,
[2:59:00] until the next time that we gather
[2:59:02] again. We ask it in Jesus Christ's name.
[2:59:05] And the church says,
[2:59:08] "I sing praises
[2:59:11] to your name,
[2:59:12] [Music]
[2:59:15] oh Lord.
[2:59:18] Praises to your name,
[2:59:21] [Music]
[2:59:23] oh Lord.
