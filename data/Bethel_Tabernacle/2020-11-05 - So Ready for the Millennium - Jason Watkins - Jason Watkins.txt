praise the lord god bless your friends happy to have you all in the house of the lord this evening amen praise the lord i miss the uh preaching on the weekend i was sure glad to have the help and appreciate all your prayers and feeling um 102 better amen i like i like brother eugene says it that way you ever ask him but gene how you doing he'll say 102 that way if you get a little low i can spot you a couple amen so we are appreciating the grace of the lord in our lives i've got a number of requests we're going to go to just after a little bit of the preaching from the word of god we're going to invite you to colossians chapter 2 this evening amen appreciate all the good singing amen if you have any let me just say for anybody out there on the stream if you have any prayer requests that you want to get in just send them to me personally on whatsapp that's where i will look for them if you send them elsewhere i might miss them because i don't want to be chasing all over there's a bunch of different ways you could send them but i'm trying to limit it to one particular way and that seems to work the best all things considered amen praise the lord i'm so happy my candidate won amen i voted for jesus and he won he voted for me and so we all got we both got elected to heaven in a rigged election amen so i appreciate that amen so we're we're going to be seated together in heavenly places together and i'm happy for that my i just was looking at the nervous anxiousness of the world and thinking boy i am so glad i am not depending upon man's wisdom for my joy and happiness amen i i think probably a two-party system is an illusion anyway that's just me i think it's just an illusion to think make you think you got choice i know this the beast powers behind it all up all of it i don't care which side the beast's power is behind it amen i want to i want to take a title tonight you ready for this title i want to take a title called so ready for the millennium how many ready for the millennia praise the lord well we're happy in christ and looking to what the lord has for us colossians chapter 2 wonderful letter from saint paul to the church at colossae he says here in verse 8 or catch 8 through 19. we'll let you be seated colossians chapter 2 verse 8 through 19 beware lest any man spoil you spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit after the tradition of men after the rudiments of the world and not after christ so i'm already ahead of the game because you know political parties have spent obscene amounts of money trying to give you vain philosophy and i'm not bound by it i don't believe any of it i am looking to christ and i want his mind that's that's my great goal in life verse 9. for in him this is the this is the lord for in him dwelleth all the fullness of the godhead bodily and ye are complete in him isn't that wonderful which is the head of all principality and power in whom also ye are circumcised with the circumcision made without hands in putting off the body of the sins of the flesh by the circumcision of christ buried with him in baptism wherein also ye are risen with him through the faith of the operation of god who hath raised him from the dead and you being dead in your in your sins and the uncircumcision of your flesh hath he quickened together with him having forgiven you all trespasses blotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was against us which was contrary to us and took it out of the way nailing it to his cross and having spoiled that means disarmed he disarmed amen brother kevin you've had to disarm some people in your day he having disarmed principalities and powers he made a show of them openly triumphing over them in it let no man therefore in other words because of everything we just read let no man therefore judge you in meter and drink or in respect of a holy day or of the new moon or of the sabbath days which are a shadow of things to come but the body is of christ let no man beguile you of your reward in a voluntary humility and worshiping of angels intruding into those things which he hath not seen vainly puffed up by his fleshly mind and not holding the head from which all the body by joints and bands having nourishment ministered and knit together increaseth with the increase of god so every time you know god brings an increase it it raises the whole family every time he becomes something more you become something more now he can't become any anything more than he's been but he as he unfolds himself and becomes known as he's becoming known you're becoming known amen all right let's pray father we thank you for your word now and i just am surrendering myself lord on this wednesday night i thank you for these people that have come out lord on a wednesday night to hear the word i pray for them i pray a special grace and blessing be upon them for their labor for their sacrifice lord for those who couldn't make it perhaps they're streaming tonight i pray your great blessing of the word be upon them as well grant it lord lift us up together in heavenly places lord we need you we need this this is a tumultuous time the world is going through lord and we know it can't continue much longer we know father the end of all things is at hand and so we confess our need of you tonight lord we ask humbly that you would supply us with everything that's needed you promised you would and so ours is to believe it and accept it and go forward in faith commit it to you in jesus name amen god bless your friends you can be seated so many wonderful promises of god you being dead in your sins and uncircumcision of your flesh hath he quickened together with him having forgiven you all of your trespasses now it's interesting because when we read this in verse 13 just let me have that back up brother kevin where we'll switch to that other translation in a moment but we'll stay in kjv for now but in verse 13 you being dead in your sins and the uncircumcision of your flesh remember that this dead doesn't mean annihilated it means separated so now you've been separated from the life of god see but you still have life you're still alive you're still a human you're still built in the image of god amen so it doesn't mean that you've been annihilated but you've been separated from his life your life is now separated from his life when you're in sins and trespasses you still bear the image of god but you are separated from god so we're it's as if then we're cut off from his spiritual life like i said now you still have human life all right you still have human life but now paul is showing to us that now god by his spirit has made you alive in other words rejoined you back to the original life amen so that and and he does it according to the scriptures uh we we won't go back and read it but paul dealt with it in the first chapter of colossians that he brings you back your original life using the same exact power that raised jesus from the dead amen not a different life not a different power you you think about resurrection mourning man that was some power here is the lord dead you know through through friday saturday into sunday morning and he's not faking death it's not almost dead he's completely dead and we realized that brother branham said that same quickening power that shook his body to life in a tomb that's the same quickening power that'll translate your mortal flesh in a rapture right amen but don't undervalue the fact that that power is already working in you and it's what reconnected you to god's life because you came here dead in trespasses and sin didn't mean you're annihilated you're still you still alive see you still got human life but you're cut off from the original source of life so we really now that's exactly why friends that when you're born again all right how many born again remember you're not annihilated the sin is still in your flesh amen but you but now because of the life of christ you're separated from sin it still lives in your flesh you still have to keep your mind subject but now you're separated not from god you're separated from the world now you're joined to god hallelujah so so we realized then that paul speaks here you know blotting out the handwriting of ordon's ordinances that was against us it's actually two things that you know first of all that god forgave you of all your trespasses all of them you know what i'm glad that every that all the trespasses he forgave me for some of them i haven't committed yet amen say how do you know that he did that because what he did he did 2000 years ago understand before i was even born before i had ever committed the first transgression i was already separated from death and joined back to christ and all the trespasses i have ever committed or will ever commit are already met in calvary and so not only did he forgive me of all my sins but but this actually when he says here in verse 14 this this handwriting of ordinances is that he literally canceled as it were written code against me now some people say the law of moses and that's true in a sense it's a little bit a little bit shallow that doesn't really grasp it because men were still being condemned by god before the law of moses amen you know when when cain got condemned and got marked the law of moses wasn't anywhere in the world so you understand that what separated came from abel is cain believed and abel didn't king abel caught a revelation and he believed cain did not and therefore he was he was sealed in now he was given opportunity to save himself but he didn't take it and the lord warned him of that that sin lieth at the door you've got to conquer it and that's what he didn't do and that's what the world isn't isn't doing they cannot blame god for the condition they're in they've chosen the condition they're in and they're still choosing it to this day so this this book of ordinance that you have to realize goes is goes way further than than the law from mount sinai this book of ordinance is is as if it's a is as if it's a written certificate of death one commentator calls it a written certificate of death here in verse 14. look with me blotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was against us and so it's it's a it's a bill of indebtedness because you were born in sin so you were born in debt you understand so so so this this written code this law this law of sin and death the law that's against you is the day you eat that day you'll die and because that we come through that process the day you're born is the day you're headed for death and it's a law of ordinances it's a written code it's a certificate of debt it's a bill of indebtedness and and here's the problem people you're unable to pay it so that makes you a criminal because you can't pay it so now you're a criminal see and so literally what paul is showing here that jesus takes away the criminal charge how does he do it by paying the debt in his own death and he nails your death certificate to his cross and you're free today because christ paid the debt for you you're no longer a criminal unless you don't accept the pardon amen i don't want to be a criminal i don't want to be an outlaw from god i want to be a son of the king i want to be in fellowship with the holy spirit i accept the pardon for my life i accept that he ablotted out all my transgressions forgave all my sins and took the certificate of indebtedness and nailed it to his tree as if to say to the devil in the world i am paying this debt amen and i forget who i wish i had brother dale here to tell me the the the captain and the boys reading it to him you know when he says it it it you know it helps me my mom always taught me to read the bible like this the cabin boys reading it to the captain and he said you know uh i i took the sins and he put his name there and i was wounded for and he put his name there and i want to tell you something tonight jesus died at calvary for the sins of jason watkins jesus it canceled the debt he paid the debt that jason watkins owed hallelujah now you can't a devil can't nobody can it doesn't matter nobody can resettle me with that debt you know why because it's paid in full so we realized that he nailed it to his cross showing firmly that he has paid the debt all right now so when we begin to look at how that he disarmed he spoiled principalities and powers and he made a show of them openly you know when i look at the sad state of the world i said it to you already i'll say it again i am so ready for a millennium i just feel that way friends if i i think i could just stand up here tonight and this whole thought came upon me just like that i just thought lord this world is so gone it is so tortured it is so broken it is so smashed and there's such lies and deceit and it's coming from all corners and perversion and and people in in and i i even thought to myself that if if the if the if the majority i i can get why they don't like a certain man because of his bombastic egotistical ways i firmly get that i don't care about it myself but i get why people get put off by our president but but i thought to myself if the world could in majority vote for the stated platform of the other side and everything that they stand for the perversions and the filth i said to myself i'm not even sure how i'm going to even think about that to think that they would that they would not only you know oh and i don't want to get all into political issues i'm determined to stay out of that tonight because i frankly do not care like i said i voted for jesus he voted for me and we both won amen and i'm going to end up in heaven i get to live in heaven with him and it's all rigged election anyway so i'm just glad that i'm in christ but i just thought when i thought about the perversions that they that they're pushing for i just thought lord we need a millennium that's the answer that's what the world needs i'm going to tell you something friends where we're running out of answers we're running out of solutions and and and things are happening and dropping upon the world and you're facing them and i'm facing them and churches around the world and the world is falling apart out from underneath as i say even so lord jesus come quickly lord hallelujah i'm so ready for it what this world needs what this world needs is tomorrow's millennium today [Applause] they need it today they don't need a change uh you know they don't they didn't need an election they need a millennium they don't need another program they don't need another superstar they need a millennium hallelujah it would bring some much needed answers to these strange and unsettling times that we have around us you see it i see it we're not naive to it solutions that you know this constant i to me it just seems like a a a a drip of human problems just humanity is so beset by just a steady drip of problems and every day you know you say a drip's not going to be much put up put a pail under a drip and come back do it that morning come back that evening you've got gallons of water and if you don't check on it it'll overflow and then you've got to mess and it's all just a drip and that's where we are today it just seems like satan has has put the world in such a condition that you know we're hardly amazed anymore you're hardly shocked anymore things that would have stunned and left left people without even a way to get their mind wrapped around some of the things that are happening in the day and hour and and i get there's always been problems and sinners and sinful things and people and calamities and all kinds of i get there's been wars and rumors of wars and genocide i'm not talking about that i'm talking about what people are allowing as normal when you go back and want to say all the calamities of the world at least we were against it when you talk about all the filth and the vile of the world at least humanities took a stand and said that's wrong today that thinking is nothing's wrong everything is okay whatever you want to do it's perfectly fine there is no right and wrong oh we need a millennium amen i am so ready for a millennium it sure would solve a great many pressing situations that life has either i don't know recently hit you with hitting you right now or standing around a corner waiting for you to come around the corner the millennium is coming friends it's very real and it's going to be very great and i i want to be there amen amen i'm looking you in the eye and i'm just telling you straight up i want to be there i look at this world and it holds no charm for me there's nothing here to charm me anymore i look and think what a millennium is and what a world we're going to have and where we're going and the life and brother branham said we're going to life we're going to live think of it and think of a world right here not in alpha centauri right here right here on this earth we're not going to have to worry about a white house or a kremlin or a vatican there's going to be a royal city a royal palace a royal king whose law is going to cover the whole earth there's going to be one law there won't be no elections we won't need to have political parties running there's only going to be one party christ hallelujah there's going to be a family a royal family and that's you and that's me and what are we we're the executors we're the where we carry forth the justice of god around the whole world and that's just the beginning friends that's just a honeymoon what does the new heavens and the new oh i want to go i want i'm ready for it in my life i say lord god bring it upon us i want to see my before another generation i don't want to see another generation have to go through what our young people are facing today unimaginable indescribable would have been frankly unbelievable just a couple decades ago none of us would have believed it that's right amen what will it take to be there in this millennium what will it take to be there that really you have to kind of break that down in my opinion my humble opinion because that's really you have to ask two questions in that if you're going to say what will it take to be there i think that you have to make that into two questions number one what has it taken already and what will it take from here what has it taken two questions highly important questions now you all agree with me you want the millennium we want to go we want that world we want to be free of this of the drip drip drip of human misery that is the earth today and it doesn't even matter i i at our at the next time i'll give it to give a little tip off to the senior youth next time brother jason gathers you i got a plan i'm going to show you something i came across and uh i'm gonna show you faces that you'll recognize sports stars hollywood stars you know uh powerful people rich people with all the fortune and glory and big contracts and music stars and and and and and they're interviewing them and they've only got one question does your fame and money bring you happiness and without the exception of even a single one they all say no no the fame doesn't bring me happiness the money doesn't bring me happiness and some of them say the money can buy me pleasures the money can buy me a sale boat in the caribbean i can go i can go sail around the caribbean for half a year but when it's over then i'm back to my my depression now what do i do and finally you spend all your money doing everything there is to do that's fun and you don't even want to do it anymore because you realize your life is just an empty chasing of the wind and every one of them i'm talking about i'd start naming names right now even even even we recognize them star music stars sports stars movie stars famous people on the cutting edge red carpet people does your money make you happy no it can't money can't buy happiness all it can do is buy pleasures but it can't buy happiness and the bible warns of that that people who suffer who suffer you say you mean they're going to suffer the flames of hell that is that it that pales in comparison say something pales in comparison to the flames of hell yeah missing heaven don't try to tell me anything about hell burning i'm burning in the lake of fire that's nothing compared to the gnashing of teeth that people are going to have not because of where they're going but because of what they missed out on and it was right there and they could have had it and it was offered and it was free and god tried to give it to him and preachers tried to preach it to him and parents tried to pray it for him and they and they chose to not go into the millennium oh you're talking about a horror of horrors two very important questions if we say i want to be in the millennium what will it take to get there first we want to look at the first question first important question first monumental question what has it taken already amen and what will it take from here these are i would say that these are the two most important questions in creation what does it take to get to the millennium could you think of i i challenge any mortal to think of a question more important than that here there's a millennium great how do i get there listen close okay i'll promise you this friends the answer to that question is more than all the midnight oil these political parties have burned all night it's more important trying to figure out who's in who's out and who's got i don't need an election to tell me who's got all power in heaven and earth i already know who has all power in heaven and earth i don't need an election to tell me who's in power i already know who's in power amen all of america trying to deal with the worry and the stress i i i'm just just what i didn't even i i i looked at it off and on just a little bit seeing who it was thinking well it looks like it's going to go this way and before long now it's going that way and that's way maybe it's back this way well no not it's going to and they don't even know and now the lawyers are in it and they're already in the courts they don't even have an answer amen they don't even have an answer what folly if your life was given to that what life would you have can you imagine that people dedicate their entire human existence to that one night in november everything hinges on that and they're not even realizing there's a millennium coming that is gonna it's gonna so make this world seem like nothing oh friends young people old people married single don't get your eyes don't be deceived by vain philosophy and imagination that's what paul's saying you've been born of god you're children of the kingdom all of america i thought about all the alka-seltzers and antacids that they're taking my goodness all the whiskey that's getting drank drinking drinking their sorrows and and you know all the worry and all the stress of bad news politically because there were no clear winners and so both sides seem to have won some and both sides seem to have lost some they don't have all the answers even still and nobody even knows and there there seems to be some good news to it it reminds me of eugene on odyssey when he comes running in one day hey guys i got some good news and some news that pretty well cancels the good news amen but you know we're not talking about this political news you may have other life news today causing you fear and anxiety politics might not be on your mind say brother jason i'm just like you i don't care too soon about it our two on our two very important questions that are under consideration i want you to know something concerning these two questions all the news is good how do i get to the millennium well remember remember what our two questions are really what has it taken already and what will it take from here and i i got here's my first answer relax it's all good news oh my think about that friend no rubs no downsides no caveats no no secret stipulations no conditions no limitations it's all good i can tell you how you got here i can tell you how how we get there how many want to know how many want to go well i i'm so glad to report to you tonight that this isn't a mixed bag that i don't got to give you good news and tell you well you want it here but you lost it over here and you you had power here but you don't now but you got it over here so it's okay it doesn't matter oh no friends the news i got tonight has nothing bad in it there's no caveats i don't got some secret i'm gonna jump out of the box with and go oh you could have almost had it sorry no you can have it for real and it's all good amen how many would like to hear some all good news you want to hear some all good news all good news that that how you got to here on your way to the millennium is all good amen i can prove it all right brother kevin ready for the nlt verse nine here's your good news here's how you got here okay now we're going to talk about what do you do from here but let's talk about how you got here already for in christ lives all the fullness of god in a human body so you also here's the good news you also are complete through your union with christ who is the head over every ruler and authority good news friends there's nobody who can kick you out of it nobody who can cancel it nobody who can take it from you this is something god has done this isn't winning and losing this is winning think of it verse 11 when you here's how you got here here's how you got here here's how it happened when you came to christ you were circumcised but not by a physical procedure christ performed a spiritual circumcision the cutting away of your sinful nature for you were buried with christ when you were baptized and with him you were raised to new life because you trusted the mighty power of god who raised christ from the dead verse 13 can it get any better you were dead because of your sins and because of your sinful nature was was not yet cut away then god made you alive with christ isn't that wonderful but wait it gets better for he forgave all your sins and he canceled all of the record of charges against us and took it away by nailing it to his cross i don't have a mixed political message for you tonight i got all good news how did i get on this road to the millennium that's how it's christ did this for you and you have you have become a new creation in christ jesus back to the kjv brother kevin for verse 15. having spoiled principalities and powers he made a show of them openly this is a beautiful concept he made a show of them openly triumphing over them you know what jesus did at calvary uh he didn't just wake up on friday and go accomplish it jesus had lived a whole life back of that friday jesus had had had came to john in the water and john had been telling the people all this time i don't know who he is i don't know where he is but i know he's here well how do you know john cause i'm here and he sent me to introduce him so i know if i'm here he's here and all we got to do is wait for the appointed hour and the father who sent me will reveal him and i have a secret i'm going to tell you but i'll know him i'll know him when i see him because the one who sent me told me how to identify him and so when john saw him he was able to identify him according to the word that came to him from god that's how you always identify identified by the word and so we realize that that that that jesus when he spoiled principalities and powers he made a show of them openly triumphing over them you have to understand friends that evil powers had dogged him his whole life evil powers who were afraid of him tried to have him killed as a child amen and would have succeeded but god anoints his anoints his caretaker joseph and says take the child and flee to egypt because they seek his life and so here hear from a baby i mean he can't even hardly find a place to be born you're saying oh i've been dog the devil's dog to me all my life the devil was dogging the lord jesus when he was still in the womb couldn't even find a place to have a child no clean sanitary place you realize all the complications that were now going to be possible in a childbirth if god doesn't come on the scene he's going to be born in an animal stall an animal stall stinking animal stall in the middle of the night he's born in a manger they seek his life from a child father has to run with him to egypt and all of his life now he's struggling because evil powers are struggling with him all along you know trying throughout his entire ministry what are they what is the devil trying to do he's trying his best to get him to abandon the path of the cross now if he had been successful we wouldn't be preaching about a millennium tonight and you just might as well go and figure out who you want as a political party eat drink and be merry for tomorrow we all die and life ain't worth anything anyhow but i'm here to tell you the devil did not succeed and he made it to calvary and there he spoiled principalities and because he did because he lives i can face tomorrow the devil tempted him we're not going to take the time to read it i'm going to run out of time fat run out of time quick but you can make a note of it in luke chapter 4 those first 13 verses you know the story from sunday school the devil takes him into the wilderness and you know here he is fasting 40 days and he's hungry and he was hungry he was a man he says here's stones turn them into bread you've got power to do that and he did have power to do that now you you think about this for a minute think about having the power to do it and on purpose not using it amen amen do you know he only had a single reason he had a single reason for not turning that stone into bread which would have pretty much just slapped the devil in the face and shut him up he could just turn it to bread and then ate it and been hungry and been and been filled brother brown says he could have done it he had the power to do it but he didn't want to use his great power so that when his family when you came into the temptation of the devil you would realize you don't need some supernatural power all you got to do is do what jesus did you have the same weapon the same access and the same authority as the son of god to say it is written say well that's not a very powerful weapon it beat the devil it'll beat him every time he takes him up on a on a on a on a high mountain you know takes him up on the on the tabernacle throw on the temple throw yourself off because it's written now now the devil's playing the game oh i can do this think you can quote the scripture to me i can quote it to you too it's written he'll give his angels the devil had read psalms he knew what david had said he'll give his angels charge over you so go ahead you know and what does jesus do jesus takes him right to the word again defeats him with the word again does it use his great power could have jumped off could have floated to the ground but that would have completely messed up god's plan and jesus didn't want to do that so that he could show you that no matter what kind of temptation you run into you can win it you just by the word alone and nothing else just your faith in god's word amen he takes him in and and to a high mountain shows him all the kingdoms of the world showed him every kingdom in its glory showed him the united states in its glory showed him europe showed him all the countries in their in their pinnacle in their glory in their in their zenith and said they're every one mind they're given under my charge and jesus never debated that with him because he knew it was true but brother ram says jesus knew that it wouldn't matter because he would fall heir to it anyway and he wasn't going to take the devil's shortcut listen friends don't take the devil's shortcut pleasures for a season because that's what he wants you to do he wants you to take pleasures for a season and trade the millennium trade the new heavens and the new earth trade all of eternity don't take the deal that's a horrible deal it wouldn't matter if you had all the money and fortune and glory and fame in the world i've already can prove to you that fortune and glory and money and fame cannot buy you happiness because there's only one form of happiness and the devil ain't got it he ain't a happy camper there's only one form of real joy and that's that in that fountain back in the eternities that was a fountain of love and brother ben said out of that fountain came joy and peace and happiness out of that fountain came mercy and grace in our lives and that's what jesus was choosing and here he is i mean he he's got a you know the devil is so strongly all through his ministry trying to force him to abandon the pathway to the cross which is why you're here in line for a millennium amen amen say yeah the devil it ain't always the devil you know if we go to matthew 16 let's let's get that one kevin matthew 16 21-21-23 now watch this one here's his own family trying their level best to stop him his own disciples from that time forth verse 21 from that time forth began jesus to show unto his disciples how that he must go into jerusalem and suffer many things of the elders and the chief priests and scribes and be killed and raised again on the third day then peter took him began to rebuke him said be it far from the lord this shall not be unto thee and he turned verse 23 and said unto peter get thee behind me satan thou art an offense unto me for thou savrus not the things that be of god but those that be of men and that's really where every human being has to answer the question do i savor the things of god or the things of men now let me tell you something understand that if he savored the things of god he's going to he's going to uh suffer many things of the elders and the chief priests and scribes he's going to be killed he's going to die a torture death that's if he savored the things of god it didn't mean he was going on a picnic but he knew better than just but peter now is savoring the things of man because because it here that jesus is once again having to work through his own family you've been there i've been there we've had this trial or that trial this friend or that friend this family that family that this person that person what is it i'm here to tell you it's the devil trying every way he can to stop you from going to calvary to stop you from choosing god's will for your life trying to take you out of the path verse 24 then said jesus unto his disciples here it is here's the secret if any man will come after me let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me satan trying to catch him in the garden luke 22 52-53 i'm hurrying luke 22 52 then said then jesus said unto the chief priests and captains of the temple and the elders which came to him be you come out as against a thief with swords and staves when i was daily with you in the temple you stretched forth no hands against me but this is your hour and the power of darkness you have to understand friends that at calvary jesus ridded himself at the cross he literally ridded himself of all of these strains that were trying to pull him out of the path for god that god had for his life he at calvary when what we read i read you a minute ago out of the uh what christ did for you at calvary and spoiled principalities and disarmed it and nailed the ordinances nailed your sins to a tree forgave all of your trespasses made you a new creation in christ jesus delivered you from death joined you back to god who you were separated from and now has separated you from the world and puts you on the path to the millennium but but his entire life they're trying to stop him trying to turn him trying to pull him trying to prevent him trying to hinder him i'm here to tell you that at calvary he ridded himself of anything that would keep him from saving you amen he stripped himself he divested himself himself he did it willingly divested anything that would hinder him in any way from getting you to the millennium and that is how you got to where you are today verse 15 he made a show i love this back to colossians 2 he made a show of them openly now this public display this is interesting i want to deal with this a minute there it is having spoiled principalities and powers he made a show of them openly triumphing triumphing over them in it so this display then now is is literally where how would i say it this is where jesus is literally going to strip away from satan every claim that he had on you ever all the claim all of satan's hold on humanity all the evil powers that when jesus died that horribly it tortures embarrassing humiliating uh rejected of all men rejected even of god when he did that he literally the bible says he made a show of them openly in other words he went there in such a way so that he would be able to remove any claim in arrears today satan because jesus was faithful at calvary because he got you on the path for the millennium there's nothing satan can do to take you off of it there's nothing he can do it's not like today where you know they think they've got a certain amount of votes and then somebody goes in the back room and they pull out all these tens of thousands oh we got all these to count to and suddenly now it's going the other direction don't worry don't worry nobody's going to come out of a closet with all kinds of your sins and your failures it was all met at calvary and jesus openly took away the claim of the devil now there's no claim he can ever have on you that display was such a way now i i i want you to absorb this for a minute because this this display as he the the the image of one that was so low i mean you you know it's the lord amen so to you it's all glorious amen you you you if you sit here and you bring the image of christ at calvary in your mind's eye you see a lovely lord jesus dying for your sins amen but that's not the image god was determined to show the image that god was going to show was judgment on the most low down filthy twisted perverted human being that had ever lived in the earth see the lord jesus was never guilty of any of that stuff correct that's what makes it so wonderful he who knew no sin became sin he didn't just become sin he became all your sin all combined of all the earth in all the ages of all through time his entire family everything they would ever do every mistake they would ever make me you them prophets priests king people didn't matter all of that was brought in one horrible one horrible mass of ugly putrified sin and was placed on a single man and the very the very imagery the very imagery that this man i mean let's imagine that you don't know who it is and you're coming up here's what you're going to see you're going to see a man first of all he's being crucified he's being murdered he's being he's being executed so obviously rome and israel don't execute good people so right away you know wow they're not just got this guy in jail they're actually killing him he must be extremely evil they stripped him naked didn't even give him the the decency to die clothed he he wasn't just dying as an execution he was dying having been tortured now imagine the casual observer who doesn't know who he is and sees this man what do you think he's going to think of this guy wow this guy you never know who this is no but he must really be one bad person because not only has rome decided to kill him israel decided to kill him they literally lacerated his body so bad brother branham said he didn't even look like a human being now you just imagine for a minute put yourself there you don't know who it is but you're seeing this image this image here's some man he's under a death sentence by two nations he's been stripped of all of his clothes he's hanging embarrassed and naked in front of the whole world he's lacerated and cut and and and even his bones he's cut so deeply in his flesh his bones are showing amen they're mocked they're not just killing him they're not just torturing him they're not just embarrassing him but then they're even mocking him and they put a crown of thorns down into his skull i mean if i don't know who this is i'm standing there going wow this guy must have really really really been nasty and then not only that but somebody walks up and says you think that's something the bible says god's word says cursed is any man who hangs on a tree now you're looking at a man who's got a double death sentence by two nations he's beaten and lacerated till his bones are showing and blood is gushing he's got thorns crushed in his head they're mocking him and spitting at him and reviling him they can't even let the man die in peace that's how horrible this image is he's being hung on a tree and the bible god's word says that if a man does that he's even cursed of god so now he's not discursed of rome he's not discursed of israel he's not just humiliated he's not just tortured he's not just executed he's cursed of god and now the sun won't shine and it goes dark in the middle of the day and all nature and even god runs away and here's this poor man you're talking about the imagery we're talking about the imagery of the most horrible person that you could ever imagine all the sin of all the people of all the ages placed on one individual and he's so cursed he's so condemned he's so judged that even brother branham says god judged him a sinner and sent him to hell and he just didn't send him to hell he seemed held tortured sent him to hell naked sent him to hell beaten sent him to hell crucified sitting to hell hung on a tree why is this imagery so important why does god gotta go so over the top beyond all sensibility beyond all reason why couldn't he just lay down and give up the ghost i will tell you why this imagery is the worst imagery of any man who ever lived who died who was ever killed nobody ever died of death like this and the the imagery is such that that you can come into this service tonight and i can say to you that i don't care what kind of a life you have ever lived i don't care what kind of guilt might be upon your mind i'm here to tell you that the image of your sacrifice was so much worse than you could ever imagine you to be i'm here to tell you according to him you look like a saint of god and this is the imagery that god has allowed he because he's got to break the claim he's going to break the hold on satan the hold that satan had on humanity for 4 000 years and now you sit here today friends how did you get to here how did you get on the road to the millennium how are you going into a millennium because somebody came down and i don't care how bad you are and i don't care how bad you've been and i don't care what mistake you make you're free in christ you're clean in christ you're redeemed in christ you're restored in christ and there's nothing you could ever do to look so bad in the image of god as the lord jesus christ appeared in the image of god hallelujah because now that same one who they gave a double execution sentence to two nations said he had to die the same one who they lacerated and tortured and killed the same one who they spit and mocked and crowned his head with thorns and plucked out his beard and railed upon him and humiliated him that same one now stands as my advocate that same one who win that filthy greasy devil tries to come up before the throne of god and tries to accuse you or tries to accuse me and i'm here to tell you he might have the goods he might have video replay he might have your fingerprints he might have your dna and he's standing there holding the evidence of your own filth in the presence of god but but this one who was tortured steps between you and the accuser and says father he is me and the father says well if he is you then he is innocent hallelujah friends and that's why we're on a road to a millennium tonight because i'm innocent not because i was good but because he nailed all of the book of ordinances that was against me he nailed it to his tree and i'm on the road for a millennium i can hope for a millennium i can speak about a millennium i don't have to be bound to this world i can say let them have it let them have it they can elect whoever they want to elect i don't even care just give me the millennium give me god give me christ give me that life i'm done with this world i want that purity i want that holiness we're on our road friends we're on our way bank on it you're on your way you're marching to zion beautiful beautiful zion satan would try to make you disbelieve it all and tell you there's there's no way for you to get there you know i i was preaching here i don't remember what several services ago about jerusalem the mother of us all you know brother brandon makes a statement i don't think i don't know if i put it down i did oh i did 1965 trying to do god's service without it being god's will i'm going to close with this right near the end of his life november 27th he's got less than a month the seventh angel the seventh star the last one he's been deployed he's he's had a 33-year ministry he's coming down to the end and before he checks out and heads to a reward way sooner than any of us thought he should have amen he comes to the pulpit and he says abraham sought for a city on the earth you know he was looking for it because he was going to live there someday abraham is in that city and he went around looking for it now brother brahm said the reason he was looking for it he knew it had to be somewhere because he had already met its king so he knew this ain't a pipe dream this isn't somebody you know it wrote a book a fiction you know x actually never marks the spot archaeologists will tell you at least indiana jones will tell you that but he knew he had met its king and brother brahm says he went around looking for it and right on the same grounds where he looked it was just above him it was just above him he'll return and we'll return in the millennium and he'll live in that city but being a prophet he was ordained and inspired he knowed watch he know there was a city somewhere and he was looking for it but you see the whole revelation of it was hid from him it wasn't for his age on down to john where he saw it coming down from god out of heaven that was the city now john writing the book of revelation that's our book that's this day to abraham it was hid from him it was just above him he was searching everywhere for it he knew it was real but the revelation of it was hindered from him i'm here to tell you something friends jerusalem is the mother of us all that you know why you know it says that because that's where i came from jerusalem bore me jerusalem is the city of the great king jerusalem is just like the earth it's an eternal attribute of god this white's eternal could never pass away jerusalem is an expression of god jerusalem above jerusalem above mount zion all of these types speaking of the bride john sees the city he's going to he says i'll show you the bride the lamb's wife he sees the city in the city it's 12 it's all these names known of god no way to ever get them taken off you only take something from friends it didn't matter all of those patriarchs all down through the old testament did some heinous horrible things you know what their names are still in that wall their names are still in that wall hallelujah there's no way to stop it because i came from there i'm a part of that that's why brother branham said not not one time has it ever missed this is events made clear in prophecy not one time has it ever missed and it won't for who are predestinated to see it will see it jesus said no man can come except my father draws him and all the fathers giving me will come it's the word joining with the word it can't do nothing else how do i get there from here i've already told you how we got here already how do i get from here to there by walking in the word let the word be anointed because it's the word speaking to the word jerusalem is just above me my heavenly home why do i want to go there so bad i'm a part of it i came from there this world is alien to me i can't get used to it i'm never going to be comfortable here i don't want fortune and glory i want christ i want a millennium i want the new world he sent me a word and that word will carry me all the way because when an anointing comes upon the word brother branham said it's the word joining the word it can't do nothing else in that jerusalem i have a different body i have a body that doesn't sin a body that has no weaknesses a body that has no complexes a body that has no fear a body that's never done anything wrong a body that's pure and virgin i'm gonna inherit a new body jerusalem you say oh brother jason you know listen the devil if he can he'll he'll discourage you he'll he'll discourage you and say you can't make it and and we do feel that way we do we do we do we feel that way say oh i want it so bad but i'm so weak but he's so strong say but i'm so rotten but he was so perfect oh can you receive that tonight friends i want to tell you something when you go through life when you go tomorrow when you leave this building tonight and you're wondering how can i ever get over this how can i ever rise above it i'm here to tell you jerusalem's just above you it's just above you your your overcoming isn't far off in some milky way it's just above you why don't you just reach up and take a hold of it and say lord it's right above me a body that obeys you every time a mind that obeys you every time a heart that obeys you every time that's what i want is that what you want we want a millennium i want the millennium i want a millennial life now hallelujah oh my i am ready i ask you at the beginning i'll ask you again who is ready for a millennium who wants to go in the millennium hallelujah i got good news it's soon and very soon oh let's stand up friends god bless you i better stop we

optimistic i'm optimistic pray that all goes well gladly brother mark gladly we'll pray for that amen and then um i want you to pray for sister debbie you know she i i want to just give just a brief explanation the lord has done so much for it thank you for your prayers she's you know probably 95 to 98 percent completely recovered she really came to the edge of a nervous collapse actually some things going on in in her mom and dad's health and it caused a lot of a lot of sudden stress upon her and tipped her over the edge but thank the lord for discerning doctors who was was able to diagnose it correctly when all the other specialists when all the other specialists were running crazy everybody had a surgery for or another thing or another thing or another thing or another thing and uh brother arvin said there's nothing wrong with her but her nerves and i was like what yeah it's just her nerves every bit of it's driven by her nerves she's having a breakdown and we managed to get her some medication for it very small dose whammo almost overnight just shows you the devil i'll tell you something friends mind is a powerful thing and the lord now has brought her almost completely out she's even been scaling back different medications looking to go off all of it trusting the lord and has made tremendous strides so she's not here on wednesdays for now because and only for one single reason because the last thing that's not yet recovered is her sleep cycle and if she doesn't sleep then the next day she's off the rails and so because that we literally they have a routine in our house everything has to start going dim we have all all devices and lights have the amber light we take out the blue light now everything has to start powering down i'm powering down i have to walk i have to speak softly not cut lights on which so that way she can slowly she gets in the bed at 7 30 and she's trying to fall asleep by 8 o'clock if she doesn't do that then she steps up all night you know she'll go to sleep she'll wake up and she'll go back sleep then she'll wake up and so the problem with the wednesday night is is if i bring her then her s that whole cycle is thrown completely out the window and she doesn't get home until after nine nine thirty she hasn't had the the slow down and so just pray because i she wants to be here so bad and uh that's why when you see her on the weekends she looks so wonderful because she is she's doing excellent she's just doing excellent and so uh i i appreciate man we had you know not just brother arvin doc meredith and doc andrew and all three of them they were the three musketeers for the pastor's wife and so i appreciate it they came at a moment's notice i never had so many house visits by uh never won't let me pay for nothing well let me pay test galore blood test won't let me pay for nothing and so god god bless our caregivers i'm glad we've got them you all have benefited from them how many hours in the middle of the night uh brother andrew and sister meredith have taken calls and brother harvin just to help just to help somebody so i sure appreciate god's mercy in all of this and uh but that's why she's not making it on wednesday nights because we've got a it's so important right now that's the last symptom she has is her sleeping is not right so we pray for her that she's doing great she's doing wonderful you saw her sunday she's awesome but if you'll notice from the from the camp from the campfire at 7 30 sharp i had to get up and go and i didn't want to we were having a good time we were out there by the fire talking and but at 7 30 i had to get her home get her in the bed quieten her down and so that's kind of just where it's at so you be praying we got a lot of needs that we're going to pray for and i want to let brother matt sing this song before we go to prayer and then yes oh mom you know i forgot what the request was yeah this is your niece kathy gene yeah yep yep yeah
