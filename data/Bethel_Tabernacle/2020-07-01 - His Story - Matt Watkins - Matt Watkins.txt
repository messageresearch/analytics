with two more images you can import them the same way and you can just don't worry about displaying the scripture if you just want to get those up now that'd be just fine everyone's got their sword here their Bible tonight a man you love the Lord amen you can still say man through those masks they don't stop you from saying hey man you love the Lord Amen praise God well certainly good to be a Christian amen good we got the peace of God and Jesus said the peace that I give not as the world gives and we know now more than ever before the world has no peace to offer none whatsoever I'm so glad we got the peace of Jesus here tonight amen I want you to look here with me in your Bible too Daniel we're just going to read just one verse here just a few verses here in Daniel chapter 1 and I just would like to take just for a moment here a thought that Lord just pressed upon my harp and I'm titling this his story his story and the real simple thought here tonight we're going to just take the first part of this and maybe just do a little bit of teaching and it may seem like a a just a little bit of a teaching lesson and I just felt led to do this felt impressed I won't stay in that gear probably the entire sermon but I would like to just look at something that I believe is real relevant for for right now and I believe that we have a word that is relevant always has always been but I do believe that there are things in the word that are specific for right now for the for not just this age lady see an age there's words there's there's things written in about the Lydia scene church age very specific there's a people that's written about that's very specific but I believe even fur than that God hasn't forgotten about us time is not just unwinding itself just like a clock that's been spun up but gods and he's sovereign and he's in control Amen right now today Wednesday night right now July 1st is it the first today God's in control right now amen I believe that let's look here in Daniel chapter 1 the third year of the reign of Jehoiakim king of Judah came Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon unto Jerusalem and besieged it and I just want to stop right there we'll just have you pray Lord we thank you Father for this service tonight we ask God for you to take your preeminence Lord only just a handful of people Lord in person Lord maybe those that weren't able to come father trusting that they are streaming Lord at home father whatever various place that they're in and that their Lord that they're participating in worship Lord for we believe now more than ever before your word told us that we should assemble ourselves more so as we see the Day approaching Lord and we truly see that day the coming of the Lord Jesus the soon coming Lord we see it approaching father we feel it more than we more than just seeing it Lord more than just reading about it we can sense it father in our spirit Lord and I pray God that you'd help us to be sensitive tonight Lord to your word may God you just be our help Lord we ask in all things in Jesus Christ's name Amen amen thank you musicians you can be seated I want you to hold your place there in the book of daniel and as i said bear with me just for a moment because i'm gonna draw something out of this that i believe is important for us to understand this book of daniel is a book that has came up a lot especially things that are happening in the world right now as we know were you know all there's more than just coronavirus now the entire world is just going crazy and and and now books like revelation people believers who hadn't looked at the book of revelations now looking at the Book of Revelations and people without understanding are looking for answers the world is looking for answers and I'm glad that we have them tonight we have answers clear answers in the word and you know maybe you know sometimes it takes a stirring like this that we're sensing right now and it takes a shaking like what we sense right now has happened in the world sometimes God uses that as a measure to stir even his own bride to even stir his own people we know that even the wise and foolish virgin both were the parable both were asleep now one had oil one didn't but both were in slumber even at the coming of the Lord behold the bridegroom cometh go ye out to meet him and so we know that even us are we even us speaking of the elected seat of God still live in this world we're still subject to a body that's not born again that's not redeemed we still have a body that gives us trouble we have mistakes we have faults and we have failures our soul has been raptured and translated into the kingdom of his dear son as the Bible says but these bodies aren't born again and they give us trouble every single day now if y'all are going to be that quiet you might as well not come to church so you're here so use your voice that God gave you say Amen if I ever needed your amens now it's now so so pull on the Word of God don't sit there and go to sleep on me I'll come down off this pulpit and stand there in front of you and spit in your face you don't want me to do that do you you got masks on so what would it what would it harm you right all right brother Mack just get back to your sermon so we we noticed this here that that our bodies aren't born again as we said we still are subdue and become subjected to the age that we're living in even the panic and the fear and the pandemonium we can be we can ingest some of that as a believer but we have a we have something to stabilize this I'm glad for that and that's the word I want to just look here just for a moment and I want to look in this Book of Daniel and we're going to take is just a lesson we actually taught one lesson I think on Sunday school on this and we're gonna cover some of those points and then come to something preaching to you tonight on his story and you look at this this book that's filled with many stories that we have I'm going to go through some of these very quickly so just listen and be attentive as best that you can but there are parts of this book that we find that are very easy to comprehend very easy to read and understand you have the stories of Daniel in the lion's den you have the story of Shadrach and meshach and abednego and those are things that we we know very well and then there's parts that even as believers we tend to skip over some of the parts that we don't understand and when you get deep into the Book of Daniel there's parts of it that are symbol and it becomes very much like the book of Revelation where the book of Revelation is just it's there's so many symbols and symbology you better have a church age book you better have a sales book sorry that you can go back to and say what is this meaning right here because you can make the Bible mean anything you want it to mean you can give it whatever I think it means this but friends we don't have to think we have a clear vindicated word we can go to and say AHA this is what it means in the Book of Revelations when it speaks of this symbol this is how it translate and how I identify it today I'm glad for that and so Daniel is very much the same exact way that it's a book that covers 75 years of the life of this man Daniel it's unique it's the Old Testament book that Jesus refers to in prophecy in Matthew 24 he picks Daniels prophecy of the 70th week in the 70 weeks of Daniel Jesus refers to it so we know that out of all the books in the Old Testament there all of them are important all of them are interlocking they all support the overall story of redemption they they're all within the Canon of Scripture they're all profitable yet there are certain books in your Bible that are highlighted or they are specific for the day and age that you and I live in they're there they're in there in bold if I could say it that way they're larger not that they're any more important or at some books are less important but the Book of Daniel is gonna have something that's very unique above all the other books in the Old Testament and that it's going to go and transcend past the time of Daniels life and half of what Daniel is going to write will not happen in his lifetime but will happen in history or in his story that's what we're preaching on here tonight two types so we understand that that the Book of Daniel is we said it covers 75 years of Daniels life but it's going to cover thousands of years of what we call history or we call time we have many different words for what we call time generations and we we live only in the element of time so our own human intellect only understands time even when you try to express eternity when we look at eternity and when if you were to ask yourself what is eternity well our only human definition is no time it's just endless it's time it's a space but but that's that's really not what eternity is so much more than just no time but eternity is what it what everything that happened in time is all - to bring about eternity can you say man those of you on the Internet I'm glad you're saying a man at home maybe I'll just preach through the camera here tonight everybody must have been in the Sun a little too long come on friends say amen to the Word of God I know you got masks on that shouldn't stop you from give me a verbal amen praise God you love the Lord so there's two types of history we know that there's history that's in the past and then we know that there's a history which is future history and you say brother Matt how can we call the future history well because it's what the Bible refers to as prophecy and what you under have to understand about prophecy is prophecy is also history because it's our happened in the mind of God now it's not our history but it's the history of his story it's already done in the mind of God even the Bible says the lamb that was slain before the foundation of the world already happened before the time event took place and so only God can tell future such as history and and Daniel what Daniel is going to see when you read The Book of Daniel as Daniels going to see into the distant future and what's amazing about it is that it's unbelievably accurate unbelievably accurate in fact let me go further and sell say this that the book that the accuracy let me start over and say the Book of Daniel is going to reveal something very amazing about the human being it's going to reveal it to us a principle something that's astounding about the human mind and the intellectual approach to God or the intellectual approach to spirituality the intellectual approach to religion if you study just historical commentary and I'm not just speaking secular if you study biblical commentators and biblical historians and you look at any Bible based literature you'll find out that in our age and in our age alone there's been a shift in an in the approach to how they treat books like the Book of Daniel believe it or not even the book of Revelation and you'll see that even in biblical literature that you can pick up from the Bible bookstore you can nowadays this go to Google and what you'll find is is that the literature surrounding the Bible in the category in two categories has drastically changed from what they were even just 65 years ago and the two categories are prophecy and miracles there's been a shift when a modern bit on a lot of this as liberal scholars and there's liberal Christian scholars as well and then they're taught in seminaries in school or brother branham call them cemeteries and they miracles and prophecies used to be considered only 65 years ago when you read about the miracle and the but when you read about a miracle in the Bible whether it's Jonah whether and the well or or even Merton further than that Jonah or Shadrach Meshach and Abednego Daniel in the lines and you look at any of these miracles there was a time when when someone wanted the proof of the vindication of the Bible they would point to miracles that you read about in the Bible as almost as if they were supportive proofs to the accuracy or the divinity of the Bible and you can read this in literate you can read it in if you go back and study arthur pink you study matthew henry you study john gill look at some of these men's from the eighteen seventeen eighteen nineteen OS they would they would they were weren't ashamed to speak about miracles they also treated the the category of prophecies of Biblical prophecy such as what you find in the Book of Daniel they treated them with a different attitude miracles and prophecies were considered to be proofs that if someone didn't believe the Bible that the inspiration of the Bible they would say we'll just look at the miracles just look at Daniel and the Lions then just look at what Jesus did turning water into wine open and blind eyes and if you don't believe that look at the prophecies the accuracy of Daniels prophecies that has been fulfilled in Gentile dispensations from the time Daniel spoke it that's how they approach that that's how they looked at it and you even look at Christian apologists for the Christian faith they would always point to miracles and prophecies in the Bible that the by to prove that the Bible is divinely inspired but now there's been a shift and it's important that it happened now it couldn't happen a hundred years ago but now there's been a demonic infiltration into the church that's labeled the Christian Church there's been a demonic blue or scheme or plan and as brother branham's would say that they that they would go to church thinking they're worshipping God and they're worshipping the devil and they don't even realize it and the shift has happened now I could give you literature if you'd like it from biblical today modern scholars who say that the books that the prophecies in the book of Daniel were inserted after the Bible was written after the Book of Daniel was written that they were later added and the reason that they give is because it's impossible it could be that accurate because Daniel when you go into chapter 11 gives specifics we're gonna get into a few of those here tonight uh nowadays miracles and prophecies are just brushed under the rug they're swept under the rug the days of miracles are passed you think that was a statement that brother Branham point he didn't you'll hear it today the Apostolic age is over brother Branham makes that comment and you say oh that was where you know he made that up he didn't make that up that's literally said and was said to me by a pastor of a church here in town biggest one we've got Apostolic age days of the Apostles is over now brother Branham Delon contended started continuing with that spirit but even today the in the Christian world nominal Christian world not all believers not all people who profess Christians we know that that we're not we don't have exclusive rights on own truth truth is a person we don't have exclusive rights on that person now the elected seat of God is the only one who have something to be able to see the fullness of the word but there's there's been light some people there's people not in the message of the hour who loves the Lord as much as you love the Lord but nominally in a in a grand scheme of things miracles and prophecies are almost considered a handicap when trying to prove that the divinity of the Bible amazing people will say almost if you'll cut out the miracles and leave out the prophecies then I could believe a book like the Bible it's human intellect trying to understand the cept of God when you Jesus said unless a man is born of the Spirit of God he'll never see the kingdom of God he can't it's impossible and so instead of people believing that it's God's book and actually the miracles and the prophecies because we live in what's called the scientific age and everything's got to be proven by a microscope they've got to observe it they've got to be able to look at it and monitor it and you've got to test it and examine it and put it through their tests and and so scientific minded people how do they deal with miracles and prophecies well miracles are you know they treat them as fiction rather than fact they treat they treat some of the stories you read about as myths legends allegories all allegorical it's pretty dangerous to to treat something that God meant literally as allegorically it's pretty dangerous when you say oh it was just the greater good it was just the moral of the story but not really the story it's amazing this shift that's happened in our age and I'm preaching to you on his story just stay with me here Daniel and the Lions Den has explained a way is that the Lions must have just been fed right before Daniel was thrown in in other words the stories that you read about don't have any historical they they didn't really take place they they never really happened there's no then out well then well then do you not believe the ball of course I believe the Bible I'm not I'm not suggesting that I'm just telling you that really you can't really read the Bible that way you've got to sort of this take the spiritual meaning out of it you can't really treat it factually because we live in a scientific age it's not really provable nothing's really provable and so you know modern liberal scholars have treated these prophecies as we said and they said they were inserted later on so now we we just have to take the moral of the story what's the moral value and that's why it's pointed the Sermon on the mountain and the golden rule and that's all they take of the Ministry of Jesus when that wasn't even the gospel that this is this is this is what we find today is that they've taken these and when you look at Daniel chapter 11 particularly and if you haven't studied that if anything this Wednesday night should do is to inspire you to go home and read the Book of Daniel because I believe it's relevant it's important right now you know even it was Daniel it was the captivity of God's people that stirred a man named Daniel to pick up the books and the scrolls and realize a prophecy that God's people were about to leave captivity in Babylon so it was calamity that stirred the heart of Daniel what should calamity do to us and when you look at Daniel chapter 11 there's over 200 specifics we don't have the time tonight obviously to get into this there's over 200 specific prophecies that Daniel gives just in chapter 11 every single one of those 200 happens after Daniel is gone all of it happens centuries later through time and and so so what we understand is you have to make a determination as a believer I either believe it or I don't believe it and let me tell you something today friend there's a class of people called unbelievers and they are anointed to unbelief there's also a class of people who are make believers and they are anointed to make belief but there's also a class of believers and they're anointed to believe it all depends on what class you are I say I'm a believer I believe every single word of it I don't question any of it and I'm anointed to believe it every one is going to fulfill apart everyone's gonna play a role in his story everyone's got a part what part are you playing this is what God says in Isaiah 46 verse 9 for I am God and there is no other I am God there is none like me declaring the end from the beginning and from ancient times things that are not yet done that's what God says about himself he says I'm going to speak of things ancient things and he said things that haven't even happened yet and then God would anoint a man like Daniel reveal it to Daniel and Daniel would begin to speak it now it's amazing to me how many people there are that want to treat the book the Bible like this but yet they somehow still want to hold on to the Bible I just say why if you can't believe it why do you still want to hold on to it and teach it if you want to question the miracles and the prophecies and say there that apostolic age is over and revelations just really meant nothing it's just so we can all go up I'm not really sure it was just there you know either you believe there's a divine interpretation to it or then why is it there right that's what I want to ask some people sometimes you you just believe that the gospel to the world that the entire revelation of God is contained within Matthew Mark Luke and John and that's the whole gospel you said for the man is that the gospel that's part of the gospel but it's not the full counsel how does acts 1 begin the former treatise what is he referring to Luke's Gospel the former treatise that I made unto you Theophilus of all that Jesus began to do and teach began but there's got to be an ending so in other words what was it saying the Gospels were about the beginning of the ministry of Christ and everything after that will be the second part of the Ministry of Christ the kingdom of God is not just what happened in Calvary the kingdom of God is what's coming and I'm afraid too many people are living for this world we're so concerned and what's gonna happen leading up to that event I say Lord let me be concerned of what's gonna happen after that event everyone gets so locked in on Lord what's it gonna be like is this the end of the world is what's it gonna look like the guys the coming of the Lord why don't instead of asking that say what's it gonna look like after you come and clean this world and fix this world where's my place in all of that Lord because we understand the kingdom of God is not just what happened it's not just what's happening it's also what's going to happen and Daniel is all about that you know and and as we said this is the reason you have this idea in the world today that you know you can keep the Bible well hi why do you still want to hold on to the Bible well you can keep it because it has good moral values has good spiritual those same people don't realize it but they're all that is is just secularism that that well then Buddha has good values Mohammed had good good knew the Muslims have good values if it's all about good value so it's a good book just cut out the miraculous and keep the moral part just cut out the prophetic and and that's exactly what the evangelical churches done today just cut out everything give me the gospel give me the cross let me see Jesus crucified and leave me right there at the cross I'm glad I'm glad there was a word that came with clarity in our generation just live by the Ten Commandments the Sermon on the Mount the miracles just forget the prophecy and miracles and prophecies the reason people can't accept the supernatural side of the Bible is because they cannot accept God and they think they've accepted God but they haven't they've accepted into an intellectual understanding because God is not in this not of this world it's in another dimension and if you believe in God you have to believe in the supernatural can you say men so what happens is the reason people Kenny as we said they really don't accept His Word they accept a story they don't accept him they don't accept they accept the history but they don't have the revelation of the his story what is what is history it's his story all of time right now is part of his story if they believed it if they really believed that if they really believed it let me go further if we really believed it make us live different but there's a built-in reluctance inside of the human mind to accept the supernatural dimension it's a and it's not just scientists some scientist scientism just in science that believes that we live in a closed you know that's exactly how science look at it we're letting a closed universe there's nothing outside of this there's no reality beyond this it's got to be put in a test tube it's got to be examined it's got to be investigated with our instruments and our tools you know and it's it's man's reluctance to accept what they can't understand so Daniel is written and if we're gonna go just a little bit further here Daniels book is written in two halves and we covered this in Sunday school are covered again it's literally split in two just like if I was to take this Daniel the original Hebrew if you go get a Hebrew Bible the books are actual books like this the book and so Daniel would be taken and you could split Daniel into two halves like this and the first half of the Book of Daniel is all about the life of Daniel it's all the first half is all about miracles and the second half is all about prophecy about what's going to happen miracles prophecy Daniel's life what happens after Daniels life are you with me and so the other half and then what happens is the people that have trouble with the supernatural part just take the first part and they leave out the state cut off the second part that's gotta have both gotta have both halves gonna have both parts and so it's written divided up and the first if you study this the first six chapters are easy to comprehend easy to understand as we said we know the stories from Sunday school but when you go to chapter 7 and 8 and 9 and 10 and 11 and 12 it takes a shift and it's harder intellectually as the Book of Revelations you go to read it and you're just can you you know without an understanding of the message you just be guessing you'd be probing like men have done for for centuries and Daniel the last half of Daniel is very much the same exact way what's amazing too about the two halves so you have one half of the Book of Daniel that's miracles and the second half this prophecy what's amazing too if you if you've had for me I even when I remember reading this and I thought my goodness it's incredible the first half of the Book of Daniel is all about him everything is about him you go and you go and read the the 7 to 12 it's all about prophecies all prophetic all what's going to happen and also chapters 1 through 6 as written in the third person the whole thing you go read Daniel and he daniel said unto the king and Daniel he said it's all the third person when you go to chapter 7 through 12 it shifts and it's all the first person I Daniel everything shifts everything changes now follow this with me here just for a moment and so everything's written I had 12 so the first half is about him let me say that again the first half is about him the second half is by him it's Daniel writing it himself as God gave him understanding Daniel's going to have this dream and so some of it has happened already some of it is happening some of it is yet to happen we know that about the book of Revelation some of it has happened some of it is happening some of it is going to happen we know that about the seven seals some of it has happened some of it all of its revealed all of its been revealed I'll try it again all of its been revealed but not but but not all of it has been fulfilled we're not we're not living thank God the sixth seal has not been fulfilled weren't still here that's their tribulation seal it hasn't taken place yet so very much the same way Daniels written the same way half as have some has happened some is happening some is going to happen first have his present second have his future and what's amazing about the first half chapter 1 through chapter 6 and then chapter seven through Chapter twelve is something so unique about it that I thought was just incredible the first chapter nether you got to follow me closer you're really going to be confused here the first chapter of the book of daniel when you read it is written in the Hebrew language just catch that so the first chapter of the first half let me give you a visual here this is the first half here's the first chapter the first chapters in Hebrew and the language of the you know what was the Hebrew language it was the language of the Jews was the Hebrew the God's people it's what language that they spoke but the next five chapters the next five you go read this for your silvery study this for yourself the next five chapters are written in Aramaic what does their make it was the common language spoken by everybody now it's amazing because it's the language that we used in the ancient world by everybody the first now when you go to the second half the first chapter of the second half and I think you already guessed it the first chapter of the second half is in our Aramaic and then the last five are in Hebrew weird in Hebrew a complete shift and reversal you think this was by accident it's not by accident at all it tells you where the chapters were meant to be read they were written for Hebrews because there was a portion of the Book of Daniel that was only for Hebrews and there was a portion that was for the rest of everybody else and let me just take that a little bit further there's parts of this Bible that's for the whole world but then there's parts that are just for you there are certain parts that are written in your language and unless you speak that language you can't understand those parts that's why the believer Higa he's been given a new language a heavenly tongue a heavenly understanding and unless you have that language which only comes by the spirit you can't understand that part of the word and so it tells you where it was written you can say you can tell which parts were meant to be read widely by everybody and understood by everybody by unbelievers and which were meant to be kept only for the people of God this is exactly why the Ministry of Jesus there were parts of it that were for the whole world and then there were parts that were only for those that had eyes to see that's why the disciples say why do you speak like this he says because it's very simple the whole mystery of God is this way to them it's not given to you it's given so blessed are your eyes for they see blessed are your ears for they hear because there's things that think that God has to say that are now listen everything is part of his story the heathens part of his story the Antichrist is part of his story the fall of the world is part of his story redemptions part of his story the Brides part of his story Ages were part of his story seals were part of his story we're all a part of his story the whole world's a part of his story but what part are you fulfilling are you here what part are you fulfilling as we said even with this pandemic it's affecting everybody everybody look around you all got masks on it's affecting everybody but what part are you fulfilling what part and what way what does this mean for the believer what does it mean for the rest of the world it means something completely different God's doing something we're still here we're still here and God's doing something in the world what are you listening to what voice are you hearing what perspective are you taking are you just drumming marching to the same drummer be this foxnews marching to the drumbeat of Facebook it's got a drumbeat and I'm not just talking about the liberal drumbeat I'm talking about the conservative one too it's got a drumbeat the whole world's being drummed to a certain sound and two parties two political parties diametrically opposed to each other and they're marching to that beat that Christian world's marching to that beat but the Bible's Jesus is the words of the message come out of her my people don't be a partaker of her sins so that you don't receive her plagues you've been separated unto God that's not your message that's not your calling we may have to watch as the rest of the world goes through and friends that may get worse than coronavirus this may just be the beginning in fact I dare to say that it is it's just the beginning uuuugh ask if you you tell me the children of Israel even though they were God's people even then go though God said I've heard the cries of my people I've come down deliver them they still were there when the plague started they still were there when the blood the river was turned into blood when the frogs when that when that when the locust now they were hidden away but they were still there God had not Exodus to listen friends there's not been a third exodus yet we're still here there's there's one coming but while I'm here I want to fulfill the part of the story that I'm supposed to be fulfilling and I don't want to synchronize myself with the rest of the world let's go a little bit further we're never gonna get to our throne here tonight oh lord help me it's 8:20 I mean that lord help me got to get through this I want I want to get to something and I just it's 8:20 already can you give me just a few minutes so you can tell notice this now I'm gonna skip some of this here and I wish we had time to cover some of this but but we just don't let me just let me just look through this when you look through the historical part of Daniel you go through all the beginning we can go through each book each chapter sorry but the the the prophecy of Daniel and Daniel 11 has amazing details about great empires I show the pictured brother Caleb if you could that first one that you have there he has this amazed using details of great empires these were political kingdoms political developments we could call them that endtime powers that Daniel sees and all of these would begin to affect don't worry that you can't read the words this is the vision that daniel has of the great mammoth the great statue and he's going to see and he begins to give details about all of these empires and these political leaders and developments and endtime powers that would affect the Jews in some kind of way they would they would have a direct correlation and so the introduction of when you go and look at Daniel chapter 11 it's given when you look at this it's all of chapter 10 it begins with this in the third year of Cyrus king of Persia a message was revealed this is Daniel 10:1 he says in the third year of Cyrus king of Persia a message was revealed to Daniel whose name was called belteshazzar the message was true but the appointed time was long and he understood the message and had understanding if you're not reading that you can read that I Daniel chapter 10 verse 1 I'm gonna read it again I thought you were reading it there with me let's listen and the third year of Cyrus king of Persia message was revealed a message was revealed to Daniel listen to this whose name was called about the Shazzer the message was true there thank you brother the message was true but the time appointed now here's time the message was true revelation was true but the time wasn't yet he says but the time appointed was long and he understood the thing and had understanding of the vision and so chapter when you read through chapter one and chapter two we can come all the way to chapter two put the slide of you could brother Caleb back up and Daniel has this great dream of this massive monument this statue anny any Nebuchadnezzar has this dream and it's not games Nebuchadnezzar's dream and he sees this great statue he calls all of his leaders all of the whiz of the world at that time you know he was a great king had a great Kingdom if you see pictures of ancient Babylon it was just looks like what exactly what you would imagine New York City or some massive city would be in biblical times it was just stretched freh was a great flat a great plain there was no Hills there was no mountains it was a plain you could look at it today it's flat as a pancake this is exactly why when he Daniel or Nebuchadnezzar here X the golden image and it stood 90 feet high you could see it across and you put that in the flat and put that in the mountains no one could see it put it on a flat land 90 feet high everybody can see it and so so Dan Nebuchadnezzar has this dream and he's troubled and he brings all of his counselors and his wise men they tell him give me the interpretation of the dream and and they now what what happened was is that they couldn't they couldn't not tell him what the interpretation was so they bring Daniel in and I think it was I don't I don't remember if it was this this dream but Nebuchadnezzar had a dream I think it was the Statue and he couldn't remember he not only did he tell his counselors tell me the interpretation he also said I don't remember what I dreamed so tell me what I dreamed and then tell me the interpretation talking about a two tricks man they can maybe pull one they couldn't do - Daniel did both said this is what you dreamed and this is the meaning of the dream and so Daniel begins to tell him this dream of this giant statue and if you go down look there on your screen if you go down you'll notice that the quality of the material is decreasing it goes from gold notice this here it's a decreasing starts with gold all the way from gold and then it moves down into silver a little bit less quality and material and then it moves from silver to iron little less quality than silver then from iron it's going to move to clay and the interpretation of the dream is that the golden head daniel says is you O king this is the kingdom of Babylon the Babylonians and Daniel begins to interpret this dream and he's fixed and then a notice here it's gonna go through time Daniel's going to say this is you O king the golden head is Nebuchadnezzar but this whole figure is an unveiling of future coming empires now notice they're all on the statue of a man a strong gray statue a giant spoke of strength that the human empires and human kingdoms will raise up Babylon being the first the golden head a great Empire great superpower and and he says it's you it's your kingdom it's this great strength of your kingdom but the the entire figure is a portrait of of kingdoms that are coming a minds not saying gold and so the so that the golden head there the golden head it was it was a it was a it was a the Babylonian Kingdom noticed this here and so this whole figure is the unveiling of future empires and each one of those empires would replace Nebuchadnezzar this is what Daniel reveals to him you're going to be replaced by another King I know you don't like to hear that I'm sure he didn't but then guess what that Kings gonna get replaced by another empire and then that Empire is gonna get replaced by another Empire and then that Empire is gonna get replaced by another empire this is all human kingdoms all human empires and it's all his story or what the world calls history it's all going to happen in history and so Babylon is going to be replaced notice this here the gold the silver the brass the iron legs the clay the iron and clay mixed in the feet so what you'll see there and so Babylon is going to be replaced by the Medes and the Persians under a nother leader named Cyrus and also Durai asur Darius and and these are other this is the Kingdom that's going to replace Nebuchadnezzar and notice this here you go look historically this is this is the interpretation of the dream the kingdom of Cyrus and Darius was never as great as Nebuchadnezzar his kingdom because it was a different quality it was never his grant it stood in its glory but it was never as glorious as when Nebuchadnezzar was there that golden head and so they would be followed after that by the Greek Empire and and and that Greek Empire that that that Grecian Empire you notice there in the midsection it would be that Greek Empire under a man named Alexander the Great would be part of that greek empire that would conquer and he would rule he would be a great man who would conquer the Persians and the Medes and then Daniel says then a little bit lower than that the Greeks would be replaced by the Romans and that's why it was in the legs because the legs speak of military and Rome was known by its military the the iron legs of Rome that it was that was his force that was its power that was its strength this Roman Empire and you can see why they would be legs of iron it represents a great army Rome was known by that great army and then it goes further and they would be followed by a mixture of that clay and iron but then Daniel sees something else go to the next slide Daniel sees a stone that's taken q-not Hugh it's hewn out of the mountain not by men's hands was it hewn by man's hands and he says in that stone Daniel sees that stone comes and it crashes into the statue and the statue now what is the statue representing Oh human empires and all human kingdoms and all of their glory and all of their power and all of their might we know that even after that other empires Gentile empires would raise them it was it wasn't just speaking of did it went in with the Romans but others human empires have risen up there's others human kingdoms and political moves and political powers America is a superpower today well I wasn't always that way one day we were we the great shining light to the world was London maybe before that it was Great Britain maybe for that was France but now America becomes a superpower a super Empire and great military strength but he sees this and God gives a warning to never can either but it's not just going to be to Nebuchadnezzar it's going to be words that ring eternally true and Daniel warns Nebuchadnezzar and gives him a warning and this is the simple warning God says I'm in charge I know all these men are gonna think they're leading and they're in charge is all their strength and all their power and all their glory and all their great pomp and power but God says but ultimately you're just pawns on the chessboard and I'll move my pieces or I want to move my pieces and God says what it what is the entire story that God is sovereign over all human kingdoms let me say this God is sovereign over this human Kingdom that we have here today he's still in control and he says I'm in charge the whole of Daniel this is what God was saying if I calls the caifa Kingdom rises it's because I caused it to rise and if a kingdom Falls it's because I caused it to fall I didn't God say that I can say to one nation and and build it up and he said then I can take that same nation if they don't repent I can destroy them he was saying all nations that come all nations that go kingdoms come kingdoms go but it's God who decides when and it's God who decides how the whole world's want to know man what's Trump gonna do to us what's Trump gonna do oh man what's he what's he's just we got that guy in there we got to get him out so the Liberals are doing everything they can to get him out everything they'll go to any measure to get him out cuz they're so worried what's he gonna do what they don't realize is there's not that it has nothing to do with what Trump's gonna do it's what your hope is gonna do cuz when the world this world economy this world system will only fall when God says it's time it's time and Trump can't mess it up Obama everyone was worried the Republicans were worried Obama's oh no Obama oh no what's it doing to Social Security oh no what sir everybody's so concerned about man's kingdom gods this is the lesson Daniel teaches us you may think you're in control of something but I am sovereign I am supreme and I'm in control and all of it is his story history is his story and God has said I'll bring other empires after you Nebuchadnezzar mm-hmm no raise up they'll be great they'll gradually notice this gradually they'll become weaker gradually there's a weakening and human kingdoms are getting weaker and weaker weaker sinner sinner sinner more shallow than they've ever been before we should be able to recognize that here today our economy the good the dollar just immediately plummets stock markets crashed the whole world's going crazy that's how fragile it is st. 2019 that was just a few months ago I think January 2020 thanks February 2020 it wasn't till March suddenly just that fast March April May June July or in July that quick and all of the security and trust that everyone's put in this this Empire and this Kingdom lost just like that it's all history it's all his story human kingdoms with less and less and less but Daniels says but there's coming a kingdom that's gonna destroy and God's gonna set up a kingdom one day and it's going to destroy all human kingdoms now they're all profounder they're all patterned after that Kingdom but they're imperfect they're a perversion of what's coming all kings were a perversion of one king one sovereign one supreme we can go further into this into chapter five you go all the way through and and it's 8:30 already so I got to get through this but now we're just gonna have to put a put of Paul's there I want to I don't just want to dismiss this there's too much here we're at 8:34 and I just want to get to something here so before we do I want to I wanted this fast-forward put that impulse here for a moment fast-forward all the way to today to this kingdom that we have here today to the world the world system that is shaking quaking the whole world's riveting and rocking and what I worried about another what about another wave I read a report today a new fear that they have as uh doctors realize a new fear of a second and a second disease second disease Darren Darren what so what could we do with two what would happen they they've gotten to thinking about those they though you know what what's good what would happen right now if suddenly some other disease some other some other a virus comes up that we don't have an answer for and we're dealing with two at the same time then what man's mind just goes and then that the the headline said doctors are in or in realize a new fear what do we do what's gonna happen let me tell you Isaiah prophesize of this and Isaiah 24 1 you don't have to turn we can we can get on the screen if they want they God he says and this is this is where it starts starts all the way in the Old Testament and God says in Isaiah 24 and verse 1 hey Isaiah begins to prophesy and he says that that there's going to be a rise up there's going to be a shaking that God says I'm going to shake the entire world and Isaiah begins to prophesy he says behold the Lord maketh the earth empty and turneth it upside down and scatter if it abroad the inhabitants thereof this is verse 11 where the Calum of Isaiah 24 oh joy is gone it says all joy Isaiah says all joy is darker now this is a prophecy this is prophetic he says I mean he says it's gonna oh joy is gone the mirth of the land is gone verse 13 when thus it shall be in the midst of the people there shall be as shaking of an olive tree God says I'm gonna shake it this is prophetic in Isaiah I'm gonna shake it as the shaking of an olive tree and as the gleaning grapes when the vintage is done and so I'm gonna shake it till all the fruit falls off of it till everything that they have on the tree is off I'm gonna shake it to nothing this is prophetic here in verse 18 he says for the windows from on higher open the foundations of the earth to shake the earth has moved exceedingly the earth shall reel to and fro and shall be removed notice this he says flee from the knows of fear shall fall into the pit he that cometh out of the midst of the shall we take him in the snare that what verse is that brother Cain of verse 18 perfect go to verse 19 the earth has suddenly broken down the earth is clean dissolved the earth is moved exceedingly now this is prophetic of of the end time and verse 20 go to the next verse for the Caleb he says the earth shall reel to and fro like a drunkard and shall be removed like a cottage like a cottage the earth shall be removed like a cottage I've got to thinking about that thought this is how this is the greatness of God the earth is just like a little house like a little cottage and then that little bitty tiny tiny cottage is a is a man named Donald Trump who thinks he's in control of everything and then over in the house is Nancy Pelosi and she thinks she's in control it's just a little cottage it's a little bitty house God says foot you're done and you're done and God says I'll shake it all I'll shake heavens and I'll shake earth he says it'll reel to and fro every rule I get caught is a transgression there if she'll be heavy upon it and it shall fall and not rise again it's going to shake it so bad God begins to proclaim and says I'm gonna shake it it's I'm gonna shake it like a cottage and he says an inch and it shall rise it shall fall and it shall not rise again notice this here this prophecy and this is this is this Ezequiel now speaking in ezekiel 38 verse 20 and this is god this is this is Ezekiel prophesied of the end of the world and he says he says it will shake the fury will arise when we shake all the men that are upon the face of the earth shall shake at my presence and the mountains shall be thrown down and the steep places fall and every wall shall fall to the ground every wall and I will be known in the eyes of many nations and they shall know that i am the lord you know further than that Joel Joel chapter 3 verse 16 the Lord also shall roar out of Zion and utter his voice from Jerusalem and the heavens and the earth shall shake but the Lord will be the hope of his people is that the hope of his people when the whole world shaking where is your hope let's try that again when the whole world is shaking where is your hope where is your hope today is it in the white house I hope not is that in the government I hope not is it in your bank account I hope not it better be in Christ when the whole world is shaking where is your hope this is notice what Joel says here he says but the Lord will be the hope of his people and the strength of this is Joel 3 verse 16 brother Caleb and the strength of his children the strength of the children of Israel the Lord shall wrought of Zion utter his voice drew some heaven desert south shake but what the Lord but the Lord I said Lord though the world shaken right now whole world shaken but you're my strength you're my hope the whole worlds swaying it's rocking we know it goes further than this we could read it in Haggai chapter 2 verse 6 for thus saith the Lord of Hosts yet once it is a little while and I will shake the heavens now you know who Jesus no no you notice who Hebrews was Paul was speaking of when he says once more I'll shake heaven this is who he was referring to Jia's prophecy for thus saith the lord of hosts yet once it is a little while and I will shake the heavens and the earth and the sea and the dry land and verse seven brother Caleb and he says and I will shake all nations and the desire of all nations shall come and I will fill this house with glory saith the Lord of Hosts now let's read Hebrews chapter 12 verse 26 yet once more I shake not the Earth only but also heaven that only notice this Hebrews chapter 12 yes whose voice then shook the earth but now with promise yay once more I shake not of the earth only but also what we just read in Haggai verse 27 brother Caleb the next verse and this word yet once more signify through removing of those things that are shaken as of things that are made that those things which cannot be shaken may remain what did the Lord do news first coming in his first coming he brought salvation to people he saved people and he's still saving people but brother Branham said in the book of life wasn't just people it was also all creation and all of the earth and so he says what's he gonna have to do he's gonna have to send it through a nuclear holocaust just the same way that you're born again by the baptism of the Holy Ghost by the fire of God brother Branham said all the atmosphere will catch on fire what's it doing it's rid of itself of sin ridding itself of man who's destroyed the earth and God says I'm coming the second time not just to redeem my people I'm also gonna redeem the earth I'm also going to redeem creation and I'm part of creation you're part of creation and if I'm part of the earth I'm gonna be redeemed with the earth are you here tonight still and so God says I'm going to shake everything I'm going to shake everything all nations whole world whole world leader what we're seeing today right now is the world being shaken systems governments world leaders shaken Church world shaken the bride the believers shaken when the world shakes you shake Jesus said they'll shake he says but there are some things that even after the shaking they'll still remain the difference is is that after the world's done shaken and God's done shaking it there's only gonna be one thing left and that's God's people that's God's family I want to say Lord let me remain let me remain in the midst of all the shaking the Lord shakes and and and we've seen this throughout history we could go through a list and I don't want to do that just to save time we're already running out of time here but you can just go back in your mind before this pandemic that we have right now just go back in your mind just years before that you'll start remembering 9/11 planes crashing into the World Trade Centers what was that it was it was more of the result of sin and the and the shaking of the world and watch what look at the shift that happened even that we gave up even even as American citizen you gave up liberties at 9/11 you think you're giving up liberties now this isn't the first time you've killed people has given up liberties they've been given up their liberties and and and then after 9/11 you have you have Hurricane Katrina you remember that Oh does anybody remember hurricane raise your hand if you were good I'm glad that wasn't a dream I had that really happened Hurricane Katrina uuugh you remember the hurt the earthquake that happened in Japan and a tsunami came and white almost wiped out all of Japan remember that it's like a it's like a chain reaction and when one thing one event start then just another one happened and then happens and then an earthquake and then a hurricane then a storm and now hurricanes are getting worse more than they've ever before we've lived here let me just let me just be a witness here for a moment twenty plus years it's only in the last three is it now three four years that we've started to actually be affected by hurricanes that come to Beaufort you think that's an accident I you might I don't you think it's that you you you notice what happens the entire world system just and then right before this you have North Korea and and we've every one's in a panic over what Kim Jong moons gonna do in the world's gonna go into we're gonna be in a nuclear war and then that was just like a little shaking and then it calms down and then oh we get back to normal and everyone's back to normal life and going about life and then right after that you have the the conflict in Syria and then a jetliner is blown up in Syria we're bombing Syria and we're wondered are we going to go into war with Syria and then you know what the reason I'm doing this is because sometimes we forget the world was falling apart before coronavirus the world's been shaking my brother my sister maybe this is what you we needed as believers to finally get us out of the slumber that some of us are in okay get us out of the slumber that we're in together and and sometimes God has to send certain things and certain things happen like this and suddenly we want to get oh you know oh what's going on oh you know I wish this whole thing else just a hoax and this ain't a hoax my brother my sister you know I I don't I'm not gonna go into conspiracy theory because that's what it is it's a theory and conspiracy theory does one thing it leads to more theories a lot more it has a all the car you watch any conspiracy and I'm not not just downing conspiracy theory videos I've watched a lot of them you know what I've done it's a lot of them you know what I do at the end I go Wow could it be maybe it could be you know what you're left with another theory another question mark more questions than you had before and and so notice this here follow follow this just here with me just for a moment what not now suddenly a pandemic now coronavirus and then we certain to that and everyone's thinking oh my goodness what's happening what's going to happen and could this be this is that the tribulation no it's not the tribulation then what is it it's I love the way brother Tim Pruett said it said it one of them in my opinion one of the best ways he said that it's like a he said you ever watched and you sat in a in a field and he said and looked way off in the distance you see a storm that's brewing that's coming you suddenly noticed dark clouds brewing and it's not here yet but it's in the distance and you're watching it and you can hear the Thunder you can see the lightning you're still in the sunshine but it's off in the distance and and that's what we watched and then it looked like we were going to come out of it and now suddenly we're all at church and only 10% of our congregation here and and the whole ten percent that's here we're in masks and people are wondering is we're gonna close church doors we're not gonna be ever gonna know what's gonna happen what's gonna happen and and and there's there's a lot more questions than answers and it's we say for the man what is it this is what I see behold I'll shake heavens and I'll shake earth not only earth uh not only the earth but also the heavens too and what's going to continue to happen as a shaking and more of a shaking I just say Lord let it shake but let me remain let it continue to shake but let me remain give me something that I'm glad I have something and let me say Lord let my faith let my assurance let my consolation be based upon your word and not in any idea of a pull a politician or idea from some person or some church leader let my foundation be based in the word because we don't know what's happening we don't know what's going to happen next but here's my assurance it's all part of his story I want to show you video and we're gonna close it's it's about ten minutes long it's just a video that I thought would was just someone sent to me today you may have already seen it if you have you see it a second time but it was staggering to me just astonishing and and and I want to play it here tonight just just for brother Caleb if you have that make sure you have the volume on the computer on the Mac II turned up pause that if you could tuber the Caleb there just for a moment you pay head I love this country and can you pie some confirm the first part okay good got it so this is a pastor of a church in Kentucky Dana Coverstone I'm a pastor should have up top right Caleb you should have a possible Patriot I love this country and I can confirm the first part of what I'm about to tell you because then you pause that okay good perfect pastor in Kentucky I'm gonna let you watch it here and and he and he's gonna begin to refer to this I can I can give you all the details but I'll let you actually watch it here but he's gonna he has a dream back in December of last year and he begins to tell his men's prayer group and the brothers in his church about this dream that he has specific to things that are taking place today and I just want you to watch just here for a moment and let it impact you the same way that it impacted me today when I watched it go ahead Caleb turn the volume loud hey this is Dana Coverstone I'm the pastor I'm a husband I'm a father I'm a patriot I love this country and if I confirm the first part of what I'm about to tell you because I've told some men at a prayer group back in December second or third week of December perfect I want to share three specific dreams that I've had recently going back to December 2 that I've had this week both both Monday and last night Monday Tuesday night because I believe number one they are prophetic the first one that I had has kind of explicitly true based on the events of March through June which we're living and I do not claim to be a prophet by any means I understand those some dreams and visions by their nature have a prophet at Tennessee to them but I do believe I've seen things both that have happened as relevant by the first dream that I had and some things that I've seen recently so you can take what I'm about to say with a grain of salt you can pray about it you can think about it but I believe that I have a warning for the kind a warning for rural America a rule a warning for America overall here's what happened back in December I will had a dream and in that dream I saw a calendar starting January 2020 and it was being flipped then I saw January I saw February I saw March and when March came up the hand held that and I saw the thing that finger underlined the month of March and then tap it three times so underlined the month of March tapped it three times so to me it was emphasis something's gonna happen in March and then I saw April May June and when June came the hand underlined June again and tapped it three times then in the vision I saw people marching I saw protests I saw people wearing masks I saw lines going into hospitals I saw typical medical doctors with needles or syringes I saw people on ventilators I saw people who were very very sick very very ill I saw newspaper headlines trumpeting thousands of people getting sick I saw ambulances just flying down roads and then I saw I saw cities on fire I saw buildings being burned I saw protesters with masks I saw people who were had their fists in the air people who were yelling and screaming angry is at just at the world I saw courthouses I saw state houses surround that I saw people who were man at the world I saw I saw a gun shotgun specifically put in the air held like this and I saw barriers within cities I told several men in my church about this and I can confirm who those men were and they'll confirm that what I'm telling you is what I told them I saw absolute chaos and the other thing I saw was vultures flying over large cities not just the ones that were burning but I saw vultures flying over the cities and I saw smoke rising and I saw I saw people fearful I saw people terrified I saw people inside their homes and looking out the windows of the windows and have with guns in their hands because there was absolute fear then I heard the words brace herself embrace yourself so since December I've been hearing those words brace herself brace herself January February came didn't seemed too much I reminded the men of the dream and then in March boom Cobin nineteen yet and things started setting down churches were shut down business was shut down the economy shut down then we began to see the protests starting in might in May in Minneapolis and all those things began to go on so where we are at the end of the primary election here in Kentucky and now there's talk of more shutdowns I just heard the governor talk about schools opening back up and things of that nature but the things that I saw in a dream a vision back in December are the same things that I watched in the news almost every day since March through June all this time I kept hearing brace yourself brace yourself I spent time in prayer I spend time in the word I'm a pastor and it's not just my job it's something that I enjoy doing I love doing and I'm very interested in the news around the world I read 40 newspapers a day from all around the world I keep up with news and other parts of the nation's better than sometimes that I hear here because it's hard to know who to trust but I get news from all over the world all around the world from both liberal and conservative sources I'm very well-read I'm very understanding of how nations work travelled quite a bit and I'm not just making these things that I can confirm what I have said and with that in mind on Monday night I had another dream and it woke me from my bed I made notes about it I shot some video myself just making sure I can remember but here's what I saw I saw a calendar start with the calendar and as I was having this the calendar was up a white figure appeared and to me it was it was a representing God the Holy Spirit something pure something right just something true something holy because there was nothing nothing sinister about it nothing evil but I heard the voice say part 2 part 2 and I saw you go up I saw July I saw August and then I saw September and I saw the finger underneath the word September I liked emphasizing it and tapped it three times and then I saw October come up and then I saw November and this is when it got real to me in the dream I think the intensity accorded my Fitbit when I woke up my heart rate was about 180 so that was Monday night there's also night that I woke up not feeling very well at all I was up during the night not feeling well but anyway the minute the finger underlined November 3 times instead of tapping it I saw a fist ball up and it hit the calendar and literally the calendar exploded into the wall the numbers seemed that there were 3d and they were falling they were just flying everywhere and there was a cloud of chaos that started and then the next thing that saw was I saw I saw armed protesters I saw fighting in the streets I saw people pummeling one another I saw businesses shuttered and shut up I saw I saw schools closed I saw school rooms with cobwebs hanging in them and like things like papers falling off the wall and posta felt like no one had been in them for months I saw banks Bank buildings with the roofs being taken off and looked almost like alien abduction because money was just flying through the roof into some type of like a vacuum cleaner that sounds kind of strange but I was watching wealth just being taken I saw politicians in back rooms making deals with people patting you patting people in the back and laughing and smiling and smirking and I saw monuments I saw I saw Washington DC burning I saw Washington DC blazing I saw fires everywhere I saw people being rounded up I saw Chinese and Russian soldiers on the grant and Russian soldiers were telling the Chinese soldiers to go and pick up these people round up these people secure this quadrant secure this area I saw blue helmets of the UN I saw military things taking place I also saw no sign of President Trump I saw no sign of leadership in Washington DC but the vultures that I had seen were now like gargoyles and there were 10 feet off the ground 10 to 15 feet off the ground and they were just attacking people mercilessly I saw people hiding in their homes and garages I saw churches being burned I saw homes being burned I saw absolute chaos and the fist punch on the November of 2020 is what got my attention and then I heard the words again brace herself brace yourself brace yourself that has been something that I have heard for almost almost seven well seven months now starting if once we get the July it's gonna be seven months and once again I'm not claiming to be a prophet I'm not claiming to proclaim you know just well see what happens in November through November and see if I'm right about this but I know when I hear God's voice I know what God's voice sounds like to me I know when he speaks and I know when I have a dream that I know is him and the things that I was saying I don't say this to scare people but I say this to warn people that there are some pretty sinister things coming down the pike and not just for the loss but for God's people as well the second dream I had last night and it woke me up in this dream we just had a yard sale to help fund a and a team going to Ecuador this next year and we had a yard sale and I had asked our secretary to get us some change for that secretary that for that yard sale so in the dream that I'm having I walked to the bank I walk into the bank to get some change and on the door it says there's no change available I saw the sign at registered in my mom and I walked on in and the president of the local bank was at the teller station and she had she was gonna be taking care of business and I said I need to get $10 in quarters for yard sale and she said I'm sorry but the US Mint is no longer making currency or making change like pennies nickels dimes quarters half we're not doing that anymore I said well what do you mean she said they've stopped doing it and I said well how are we gonna be able to charge a dollar 50 for anything and she said prepare for hyperinflation and just charge $2 and then she said to me in the dream oh and by the way $1 and $5 bills will follow soon after that and then I heard those words brace herself brace yourself brace yourself and I woke up I wrote these things down I've never gone on video and a record of the dreams that I've had and I hesitated to not do the one I had back in December but everything I saw and that dream in December came true between March and June when in the dream I was showed March through June and so I don't think I would be doing anyone a service if I don't share what I saw in these dreams and visions and I believe that we're gonna see not just a second huge wave of cobia between September October November but we're gonna see major things with the elections we're gonna see major chaos in our country we're gonna see troops in our cities we're gonna see the protests get even worse we're gonna see buildings burn we're gonna see what could only lead to civil war in this country and so for my friends that are believers I'm here I'm just gonna show you what I what I think you need to hear first of all you need to be preparing food you make sure you've got alternative forms of currency like silver or gold or whatever I believe you need to have an ample supply of both guns and ammunition and that's not just the second amendment fan of me coming out that is the things that we're seeing there talk about defunding the police that means one thing you're on your own a lot of areas I also believe you need to be praying like you've never prayed before make sure your family knows what's going on where you are have some some communication between your family about if certain things happen if certain things go down I'm not saying get off the grid and I've never ever said anything like this in my church I have said I believe things that this could happen but I've never done what I'm doing now I'm telling you that between September and November of this coming year and you'll be able to check me know if if bout time these November nothing's happened or simmer first man you called you call me on this si Dana cover stone you were an absolute idiot and a fool for saying those things go right ahead but I realize I'm responsible for what I've spoken but I also know what I sense and I know the Holy Spirit's voice enough to know that what I've heard I believe is gonna happen and what I heard in December happened between March and June not because I'm a prophet because dreams have a prophetic edge to them sometimes I've been doing a whole series on dreams and visions I'm gonna finish that series up tonight on my our church and gonna talk about why dreams and visions are literally an extension of the spiritual gifts at first Corinthians chapter 12 because we're a wisdom or a knowledge the servant all those things are required for dreams and I pray Lord show me what these things mean that I have seen show me how to interpret them and what they are and right now as I speak this it is it was June 24th Wednesday night at 5:30 p.m. in Burkesville Kentucky I'm in my office at the church Limor ministries in Birch Hill Kentucky sharing this not to scare you because I believe you know look God gave the prophets of the Old Testament a lot of warnings not to scare people but to prepare them for what was coming and sometimes challenging you don't just throw my word away don't just think I'm some some preacher trying to get people to come that's not it either because look the Bible says last day is a bit great falling away Jesus tells people to endure to the end make sure you endure to the end why because people won't endure sound doctrine they're gonna they're gonna hear something you know some of you hear me and go oh man he is on drugs or something I'm just telling you the dreams I've had you can do with them you can interpret them the way that you want to but I'm going to declare that I believe we're gonna see between September and November incredible terrible awful nasty bad things happen this nation and for the people who are not prepared for it it's not just going to catch them catch them in a bad place it's gonna destroy a lot of faith a lot of harlot relationships a lot of people it's gonna the aim is to kill this nation because right now we are a nation that stands in the way of a lot of the Antichrist principles like freedom liberty justice First Amendment Second Amendment thus Antichrist doesn't want those things and yes I do believe the under Christ is alive and well on planet Earth and I don't like I don't I don't really care what people think about this video you can call me whatever you want you can say whatever you want about me but wait till December first to say it and if I'm wrong I'll be the first one to come out and say folks I don't know what I was thinking I don't want to hate that night I've never had two dreams like this I've never had a part 1 part 2 part 1 came fully true and part 2 I believe will as well so heed my words folks believers stop messing around if you're not living for the Lord like you need to because the press there's an Olive Press moment coming for the church in this country an Olive Press moment and we're gonna get crushed and squeeze and push down that's why I believe God keeps saying brace yourself he's saying this to me so I can say to you brace yourself for the things that are coming endure to the end no matter how hard it gets I'm not giving up the faith that I have in Christ I've come too far on this walk and too far in my life to do that but I want to make sure that others don't make that mistake and don't just walk away from it take up the cross deny yourself and follow him thanks for listening I could say a lot of things and I was affected by it watching it today I just thought it was astounding you said with a Matt well you know what if it doesn't come true well what if it doesn't and here's a man who's putting himself out there put it on his facebook his personal facebook first part says he's got a group of men he could name dreamed about everything we're seeing today protests Cove it the whole thing and it came to pass could it be could be you know God uses dreams we don't throw the entire Bible God use rooms think of us think of the dreams that brother branham tells attributes to his ministry that were given by other men junior Jackson and you know different ones brother brother he's but I'm trying to think of the other one who I was just reading about today and standing in the gap he heard that brother Branham tell us about the man who has that has the dream there where he goes with and they took off but you know God used dreams throughout the whole Bible think of Abimelech middle like with Sarah Abraham has a dream pilot's wife you know has a dream in the middle of the night says leave this man alone has troubled me in a dream all night God can use dreams God could speak to anybody and a lot of people say oh well you know who's this guy what I'm not espousing this this gentleman or that his dream is vindicated and it's gonna gonna come to pass I don't know all I know friends is the world is shaking and where is your refuge what is your hope where's your hope at what is what is your refuge where's your stability in times like this I think sometimes we it's good for moments like these to happen so that we even as the elected of God can check ourself and say Lord what beat am i marching to I I don't know when the coming to laura's no man knows the day or the hour don't know what all will happen tomorrow will happen in November September the rest of the year all I know is I want my hope to be in Jesus I want him to be that and nothing else cuz nothing else matters stand to your feet we're not gonna gather we have to prayer requests [Music] prayer this is for mother Tim Pruitt I'm sure
