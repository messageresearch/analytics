[22:43] and and and something downtown and down
[22:46] a street and he said I was laying in the
[22:48] bed all that night sick and he said I
[22:52] was so sick and he said I I went
[22:55] delirious and he said I would pass out
[22:57] and he said every time I would wake up
[23:00] he said I would come conscious just long
[23:02] enough to say devil you're a liar and he
[23:04] said I'd faint again and he said I'd
[23:06] wake up again a few hours later sweating
[23:08] devil you're a liar and he said I'd pass
[23:10] out again he did that all night he said
[23:12] I just kept waking up calling him a liar
[23:14] said by morning's light the devil got
[23:16] discouraged and left me and he said I
[23:19] went on and did what I was supposed to
[23:20] do amen so I'm just saying I I believe I
[23:23] discouraged him today amen we're going
[23:25] to look into the word of God in Chapter
[23:28] 11 11th chapter of Matthew's gospel I
[23:31] want to uh invite you to begin at verse
[23:35] 27 amen praise the
[23:40] Lord Matthew chap 11 verse
[23:44] 27 all things are delivered unto me of
[23:49] my
[23:50] father and no man knoweth the son but
[23:53] the father neither knoweth any man the
[23:56] father save the son and and he to
[23:59] whomsoever the son will reveal
[24:02] him come unto me all ye that labor and
[24:06] are heavy laden and I will give you rest
[24:11] take my yoke upon you and learn of me
[24:15] for I am meek and lowly in heart and ye
[24:18] shall find rest unto your souls for my
[24:22] yoke is
[24:23] easy and my burden is light amen let's
[24:30] pray Master having read your word we
[24:33] know there's a blessing in reading it we
[24:35] know there's a blessing in hearing it
[24:37] read so we are looking to you now father
[24:40] and I cast down lord every contrary uh
[24:44] notion that the enemy would have and
[24:47] Lord we're here father at under your
[24:50] leadership to preach the word of God and
[24:52] I pray tonight that Lord it will it will
[24:56] be within me perhaps Lord we will all
[24:59] leave here tonight I know I know I have
[25:01] certainly felt this that John said it
[25:04] was indeed it was sweet in my mouth but
[25:06] it was bitter in my belly and so I pray
[25:09] tonight Lord that whatever is the case
[25:12] you will allow us to assimilate this
[25:14] word so that it can become a part of us
[25:17] we are determined to be Overcomers and
[25:20] be your people in this age we are
[25:22] determined to be the final voice as you
[25:25] have ordained to this final age and Lord
[25:28] the end enemy it's all he's already too
[25:30] late Lord he cannot win so we're asking
[25:33] for your help tonight in Jesus name amen
[25:36] God bless you friend you can be
[25:56] seated brother brandom
[26:00] comes to a message that he titled life
[26:03] it's a very good message so wonderful
[26:06] brother brandham is preaching it from
[26:09] the real depths of his heart one of
[26:11] those heart grabbing type of sermons
[26:14] 1957 he calls it
[26:17] life and he asked this question you know
[26:20] speaking in in his sermon he says
[26:23] someone has asked the question who is
[26:27] this great
[26:28] Jehovah and where did he begin at he
[26:32] says he had no
[26:34] beginning he was forever God now the
[26:37] word forever just means a space of time
[26:40] but eternity means forever but forever
[26:43] the word forever in Hebrew means a space
[26:46] lotted time for it's in plural forever
[26:49] and forever that means to Forever see
[26:52] but in eternity is one complete eternity
[26:56] a circle that that has no end so it has
[27:00] no beginning and it has no end it never
[27:04] had a beginning and it never will have
[27:07] an end and how that in the world we know
[27:11] that there is a real true Spirit of
[27:17] Love there is a real true Spirit of
[27:20] Love there is a real true Spirit of
[27:25] loyalty amen there is a real
[27:29] true Spirit of honesty now if there's a
[27:32] true Spirit of love then there's a fake
[27:35] one if there's a true loyalty and a true
[27:38] honesty then there's a artificial
[27:41] honesty an artificial loyalty see so he
[27:46] says we
[27:47] know that that is God God is the very
[27:52] Fountain and he's going to begin to
[27:55] describe this great fountain in the
[27:57] eternities brother Bram describes it in
[27:59] a number of places throughout his
[28:01] ministry I love this one excuse me I'll
[28:05] get i'll get this blowed out in a
[28:06] minute brother
[28:08] brandom talks about God this great
[28:11] fountain that was in
[28:13] eternity and he says to his audience
[28:15] here he says let's Close Our Eyes For a
[28:18] Moment close our eyes to our
[28:20] imaginations for a few
[28:23] moments and go way back into before
[28:26] there was anything that's pretty far
[28:29] amen the great Fountain of all
[28:34] eternity was that Spirit of love joy
[28:39] that Spirit of honesty that Spirit of
[28:42] tress in this
[28:45] Perfection and then out of the existence
[28:48] of the father went the logos which was
[28:50] the son which was a theophany which was
[28:53] the body of the great Jehovah God went
[28:56] forth in a Celestial body brother
[28:58] brandham talks about in other places he
[29:00] says I can see him that that little
[29:04] light beginning to form he says
[29:06] something that could be seen this is
[29:08] before Angels this is before anything it
[29:11] was in that form that he created
[29:13] everything so this is the first form God
[29:16] takes from that Eternal fountain that
[29:18] eternal spirit and he he he begins to
[29:21] take on a form and it was a a a
[29:25] theophany it veiled that Pillar of Fire
[29:27] that veiled the theophany of God and so
[29:31] he goes on here he says
[29:33] now he says which was the body of the
[29:35] great Jehovah God went forth in a
[29:37] Celestial body that's the
[29:39] logos the words spoke out of them great
[29:43] Fountains of life and went forth I I was
[29:47] I was reading this and I was thinking to
[29:50] myself I could only accept this from a
[29:54] prophet I mean you know when you when
[29:56] you read Isaiah and Isaiah says I saw
[29:59] the Lord high and lifted up and his
[30:02] train filled the temple I would need it
[30:04] to be a prophet to to to get a hold of
[30:07] that some you know when Ezekiel begins
[30:10] to talk about what he saw I'm going to
[30:12] need it to be a prophet because a
[30:14] prophet is one that can go up into those
[30:16] High atmospheres and actually see things
[30:18] and come back and describe it to me in
[30:21] intricate detail so I'm glad in the last
[30:24] day that you know we had a prophet who
[30:26] didn't just say you know God and the
[30:28] lofty heavens and Christ uh spoke all
[30:31] things into existence no brother
[30:32] brandham being a prophet he goes all the
[30:35] way back before there's anything and he
[30:37] says he was that great Fountain and out
[30:40] down from him flowed love and harmony
[30:42] and peace and truthfulness and and and
[30:46] and honesty and integrity and all and
[30:48] peace that peace and joy that passes
[30:52] understanding you got your mind around
[30:54] it amen
[30:58] so he says the word went out of them
[31:00] great Fountains of life and went forth
[31:03] and there was the theophany which was
[31:05] God made into word then that theophany
[31:09] was made flesh in the person of Christ
[31:11] Jesus isn't that simple I it's it it
[31:14] astonishes me how that people who are
[31:17] schooled and
[31:19] scholarly uh find three separate persons
[31:22] in the godhead and it's all because they
[31:25] don't and even the Oneness don't have it
[31:27] right either either and it's all because
[31:29] they don't catch the concept of the word
[31:32] that God was unfolding himself
[31:35] expressing himself on and on and on and
[31:38] that's why you are a continuation of
[31:40] that same expression yes amen he started
[31:43] as a fountain eventually he got to
[31:46] you God amen amen
[31:52] amen so he says that great fountain that
[31:55] that which was God made into word then
[31:58] theophany was made flesh in the person
[32:00] of Christ
[32:01] Jesus and then all the fullness of the
[32:04] trinity dwelt in him both Father Son and
[32:08] Holy Spirit all in that and that's the
[32:12] very way we go Plumb back to the
[32:15] original beginning of God there we are
[32:19] born again not of Flesh born again not
[32:23] of blood but Born Again by the spirit
[32:27] amen and in that eternal spirit of love
[32:29] and honesty comes down to make its place
[32:33] in us hallelujah amen so this is more
[32:37] than just what the the world of
[32:40] Christendom understands as you know I
[32:42] made a decision for Jesus it is so much
[32:46] more than that amen you understand that
[32:50] that that that wondering s star that
[32:53] came out from God and fell into a a a
[32:56] sinful world through a Fallen condition
[32:59] in a sin birth and and the spirit of God
[33:02] went through the Earth until he found
[33:04] you and he brought you back un himself
[33:06] you were always his hallelujah amen
[33:11] amen and I'm glad because oh yeah if I
[33:15] would if it would have been left up to
[33:17] me to make the decision let's let's be
[33:20] honest with each other we always we
[33:22] don't always make the right decision and
[33:25] sometimes we feel like yeah I'm ready to
[33:27] I'm ready to die for Christ and then
[33:29] sometimes we can't even find ourselves
[33:32] simply
[33:33] overcoming sinful things amen and the
[33:36] day before we were ready to give our
[33:38] life for it and here now we're wondering
[33:40] w you know wow so I'm glad it's not
[33:43] based on me making a decision cuz my
[33:46] decisions sometimes are wrong and
[33:48] sometimes they fail and and and
[33:50] sometimes I don't keep all my promises
[33:53] come on all you holy people that's right
[33:56] that's what David was thinking on his
[33:58] ways brother Bram takes that there and
[34:00] David say I thought on my ways brother
[34:02] Ram said David started thinking about
[34:04] all the promises that he had made to God
[34:06] and he knew he hadn't kept them all amen
[34:09] and he said I started thinking on my
[34:10] ways I'm G to tell you something friends
[34:13] I I I come here to you tonight I spent
[34:15] all day thinking on my ways and and I
[34:17] want to be like David I I I realize I
[34:20] need to turn my feet toward him more
[34:23] that's what this sermon this this this
[34:25] fifth part tonight just so Happ happens
[34:28] that it's it's it's Grace it's Faith
[34:30] it's five it's amen hallelujah
[34:37] amen so he says now we're born again by
[34:40] the
[34:41] spirit so we go Plum back to the
[34:44] original beginning of God and in that
[34:46] eternal spirit of love and honesty comes
[34:48] down to make its place in
[34:50] us and then when we die from this life
[34:54] we go into the body which and he quotes
[34:56] the scripture if this Earthly Tabernacle
[34:58] be dissolved we have a a
[35:12] theophonic up from Earth again and made
[35:14] in a glorified state to live in his
[35:17] presence
[35:18] forever then oh thank God then all the
[35:23] perversion all the things that was in
[35:25] the perversion all goes out of existence
[35:29] flesh goes to its punishment hell opens
[35:32] up her mouth and swallows in all the
[35:34] evil and the perversion and God and his
[35:37] beloved Church his bride takes their
[35:40] stand for the eternities to roll on
[35:43] that's the great hope of the Christian
[35:45] church that's the great hope of me today
[35:48] is that the great hope that's in your
[35:50] heart tonight
[35:53] amen you know in our text and I I was
[35:56] saying some kind of touching on this
[35:58] last
[35:59] Sunday you'll notice in our text that
[36:01] Jesus had said in the 28th verse come
[36:05] unto me all you that labor and are heavy
[36:07] laden and I will give you rest and then
[36:08] he goes into the 29th verse take my yoke
[36:11] upon you and learn of me so now I want
[36:14] you to see that's
[36:16] progress that's another step come unto
[36:19] me I will give you rest amen but once
[36:24] once and the rest is the new birth I'm
[36:26] going to talk about that but once that
[36:27] that's happened once once you're born
[36:30] again as as brother Brandon would often
[36:32] say when you're born again of the spirit
[36:35] of God that's not the end of your
[36:38] journey you're just getting
[36:40] started
[36:42] see so first the Lord says come unto me
[36:46] and I will give you rest and we know
[36:49] that
[36:50] Paul proved by the Old Testament that
[36:54] the promise of rest was the new birth
[36:57] Earth and the Holy Ghost amen and he
[37:00] goes back and he says he says otherwise
[37:03] you know why when they enter into the
[37:06] promised land but yet Joshua speaks of
[37:08] another rest and so Paul is proving by
[37:11] the Old Testament that that there was a
[37:14] rest yet for the family of God even
[37:16] though Israel entered the promised land
[37:18] there was yet a rest still coming it was
[37:21] never just going to be a natural land
[37:24] it's a spiritual possession which will
[37:26] lead us back to a redeemed Earth and
[37:29] then you won't just have a little
[37:30] section of land the whole world the
[37:32] whole universe will be yours
[37:35] amen so the promise of rest that Jesus
[37:38] is speaking of here come unto me all ye
[37:41] that are weary and heavy laden I will
[37:43] give you rest so that is a promise of
[37:46] the new birth in the Holy
[37:49] Ghost that new birth which would be the
[37:53] very moment and I I want to be very
[37:56] careful not care F I want to be very
[37:59] exact I want to be carefully exact how I
[38:02] say this amen uh because there there's
[38:06] amazingly confusion on it but the very
[38:09] moment that you
[38:11] hear
[38:13] recognize and act upon the Living Word
[38:16] of your hour coming to the Lord in
[38:20] complete surrender and through
[38:23] repentance of all you are and all you
[38:27] have ever been then the promise of the
[38:30] Holy Ghost is yours and you enter into
[38:34] the rest
[38:36] eternally the Holy Ghost is not hard to
[38:39] get that's why brother Brandon would say
[38:42] God wants to give it to you more than
[38:44] you want to receive it the problem was
[38:46] that coming up out of the church ages
[38:48] and coming up from the isua Revival they
[38:51] mistakenly thought that they understood
[38:54] what the what the real baptism of the
[38:56] Holy Ghost was and so we we've had to we
[39:00] had to wave through all of that and the
[39:01] prophet had to come along and start
[39:03] separating it out and then the opening
[39:05] of the word comes and then brother
[39:06] Brandon would begin to go down the line
[39:08] and say because you believe the word and
[39:11] I read that to you remember we came to
[39:13] we came to it in in Thessalonians where
[39:15] Paul where Paul is showing that that you
[39:18] are the accepted people because you have
[39:21] believed my testimony amen but then we
[39:25] also know it's more than just mental or
[39:27] mental agreement to the truth it's more
[39:31] than just knowing the truth because you
[39:33] say well I I I believe that I believe
[39:36] that God is and the devil also believes
[39:39] that I believe Jesus is the son of God
[39:41] the devil also believes that I believe
[39:43] God sent a prophet the devil I promise
[39:45] you believes that amen he took a beating
[39:48] for 33 years he's well acquainted with a
[39:51] prophet walking the land people can say
[39:53] what they want but the devil knows who
[39:54] the prophet was amen
[39:57] you don't you don't get pounded that
[39:59] long uh and not know who's pounding you
[40:04] amen so we find that a lot of times it
[40:07] was well we got to have this sensation
[40:11] or this that and that's all fine those
[40:13] those kinds of things depending on how
[40:15] your makeup is and and how the Holy
[40:17] Spirit works in your life it's an
[40:19] individual Affair you understand but but
[40:22] the bottom line is that I have heard and
[40:25] I have recognized and how did I do do
[40:27] that because the Holy Spirit revealed it
[40:29] to me and how did I get the Revelation
[40:32] because I had a something inside me that
[40:34] could respond to the word and I heard
[40:37] and I recognized my day and its message
[40:40] and then I acted upon that word and what
[40:42] did I do I repented thoroughly I said I
[40:45] don't want my life I don't want anything
[40:47] about it I don't want to be me Lord I
[40:49] want to be like you hallelujah amen the
[40:53] Lord knew I meant
[40:55] it and he kept his promised to
[40:58] me and now it's it's it's it's
[41:01] unbreakable that's right it's an
[41:03] unbreakable seal the devil can't break
[41:05] it don't let him tell you he can he
[41:08] can't even you can't break it
[41:11] amen you have come out of Egypt and
[41:14] you've entered into the promised land
[41:16] you have as Jesus would say in St John
[41:18] 5:24 you have passed from Death to life
[41:22] you can never come into the Judgment or
[41:24] the condemnation amen
[41:28] but again this is just the
[41:31] beginning not the ending just as Israel
[41:35] had to conquer every enemy after they
[41:38] crossed into the promised land they
[41:39] still had to conquer every enemy they
[41:41] had to drive them out they had to
[41:43] possess their land and I'm here to tell
[41:45] you something friends we know that that
[41:48] all that God has for us uh in growth and
[41:52] maturity after our new birth we're not
[41:54] talking about growing into a new birth
[41:57] right we are not talking about that
[42:00] that's a misunderstanding of the new
[42:02] birth I'm not growing into a new birth I
[42:05] have repented I have heard recognized my
[42:07] day I have believed on the Son of God I
[42:10] have surrendered my whole heart and Life
[42:11] to him and I have received the baptism
[42:13] of the Holy Ghost but now comes the time
[42:16] where I'm going to begin to grow and I'm
[42:17] going to begin to mature and sometimes
[42:20] and really in every case that can need
[42:23] time to fully make your new birth your
[42:26] own
[42:28] Amen to fully make it my
[42:32] own your Pilgrim Journey down here is
[42:36] not summed up as you've heard me say
[42:38] many times it's your Pilgrim Journey
[42:40] here is not summed up in okay you come
[42:43] to an altar and the Lord says okay
[42:46] you're in uh see you in see you in
[42:48] heaven you're redeemed see you in heaven
[42:51] it's not it's not how it works the whole
[42:53] purpose is so that the the whole mystery
[42:56] of red Redemption is supposed to be
[42:58] Christ in you living out to the whole
[43:03] world see so you're redeemed it and and
[43:07] and and and if that's the end of it then
[43:10] then then where's your
[43:13] persevering where's your living by faith
[43:15] where's your overcoming and dying daily
[43:18] amen I'm here to tell you something
[43:19] friends we have to Die daily we have to
[43:21] overcome daily we have to press the
[43:25] battle amen how else do we get up into
[43:28] those High atmospheres I I I reminded
[43:31] you of that last Sunday how are we going
[43:33] to get up into those High atmospheres
[43:36] that brother Brandon spoke of where all
[43:38] things are possible and the power of the
[43:40] spoken word flows through you because
[43:43] God knows he can trust
[43:48] you it's why brother Brandon would say
[43:50] you're just getting
[43:52] started goodness brother Bram had
[43:54] already been a Christian for many years
[43:55] and done been around the world and when
[43:57] he he comes there with his hands laid
[43:59] behind his and and he's getting ready to
[44:01] have an experience of going into that
[44:03] sixth Dimension and that's the very
[44:05] thing they're saying to him you're just
[44:07] getting started yeah
[44:12] amen the principle is not hard to to see
[44:16] because in fact is the the the principal
[44:19] aim uh is
[44:22] seen all the way back in Genesis in the
[44:25] fellowship that God had on a daily basis
[44:30] with Adam and Eve yeah that's the
[44:33] Genesis pattern and God never changes
[44:35] his mind about his
[44:37] word this is where brother brandham said
[44:39] that third phase of he he had one goal
[44:42] and that was to to go to to be expressed
[44:45] but he does it in three phases first
[44:47] he's going to be expressed in all the
[44:49] prophets priests and Kings he's going to
[44:50] come and be expressed fully in Christ
[44:53] and then he's going to commit the
[44:55] sacrifice be be killed he's be buried
[44:58] he'll raise he'll Ascend and then he'll
[45:00] send his life back into the church and
[45:02] get preeminence over his body the bride
[45:05] but the but the whole thing was always
[45:07] going to be to restore the kingdom back
[45:10] to its rightly position you're on that
[45:12] road right now that's what's up that's
[45:14] what's happening that's why it's a
[45:16] battle that's why Satan hates you cuz he
[45:18] can't stop
[45:20] that amen he thought he stopped it in
[45:23] Genesis he's wrong right amen
[45:28] so that so the very principle is seen in
[45:31] the fellowship that God had with Adam
[45:33] and Eve in Genesis and in fact is it's
[45:36] the exact same principle that we see
[45:38] operating in the Millennium brother
[45:40] brandham comes to the exposition of the
[45:42] seven Church age of the church age book
[45:44] thoy in church age he's talking about
[45:46] the ministry of the Morning Star it's a
[45:49] promise for our
[45:51] day because the evening star and The
[45:53] Morning Star are the same star it shall
[45:55] be light in the evening time amen the
[45:58] path to Glory you shall surely find
[46:00] right see it'd be a day it'd be dismal
[46:03] you can't call it day or night but in
[46:04] the evening time it shall be light the
[46:06] evening time light is the Morning Star
[46:09] you understand it it shows that it's the
[46:12] that it's the coming of Christ back to
[46:13] his full word again but Christ oh my
[46:16] goodness friends Christ had decided to
[46:19] stop being alone back in the aons he's
[46:22] coming to claim a bride and bring her to
[46:24] himself amen yes so brother Brenham says
[46:28] it is the morning star that is visible
[46:31] when the light of the sun commences to
[46:33] shine when our son Jesus comes there
[46:37] will be no further need of Messengers he
[46:40] will bring us his message of cheer
[46:43] himself as he rules his kingdom and we
[46:47] live in his presence the light of the
[46:50] word will become brighter and brighter
[46:53] in our perfect day amen so it's not only
[46:58] not only is that Fellowship seen in
[47:01] Genesis in Adam and Eve but it's seen in
[47:04] Christ and his bride in the Millennium
[47:06] this is the very thing he's saying he
[47:08] will bring us the message of cheer
[47:10] himself as he rules his kingdom and we
[47:12] live in his presence
[47:15] amen we live in his presence so from
[47:20] Genesis to the Millennium you can see
[47:22] that this has always been the pattern
[47:24] this was always what the promise of the
[47:26] best would
[47:28] be so you're following him now amen to
[47:32] get from this broken world to a
[47:35] millennial world yeah but in the
[47:37] millennial World you'll still be
[47:39] following him from there you'll still be
[47:41] following him and his presence to get to
[47:44] a new heavens and a new Earth so while
[47:47] we're here there is a daily connection
[47:52] with the spirit of God that you need to
[47:54] have you need to get a hold of it and
[47:56] and you need to hang on to it every
[48:01] day every day we should be reaching for
[48:06] a higher handhold on this climb up Zion
[48:10] Hallelujah every day you should reach
[48:12] for a higher handhold and climb up
[48:14] higher you're climbing Des Zion
[48:19] amen it's Christ in you the hope of
[48:24] glory so the mind of
[48:27] Christ you know there there must be an
[48:30] appropriation that it the mind of Christ
[48:33] is not just a a cliche let this mind be
[48:37] in you what does that even mean if it's
[48:40] not assimilated if there if there's not
[48:42] an if it's not appropriated into our
[48:44] innermost being there that there is to
[48:48] be understand there is to be a
[48:50] fellowship in your Redemption yes amen
[48:59] but without our
[49:03] willingness you buckled in tight
[49:07] amen without our willingness and
[49:12] self-discipline not even Christ's giving
[49:16] can make it our own in full experience
[49:20] and enjoyment amen want to say it
[49:23] again unless there is an appropriation
[49:27] by you of this Fellowship that is to
[49:31] exist in Redemption brother Brandon
[49:32] preached Redemption by Fellowship I read
[49:35] that to you
[49:37] Sunday in the Redemption the whole
[49:40] purpose of the Redemption is to restore
[49:43] fellowship and if you don't take
[49:45] ownership of that and every day
[49:47] discipline yourself and have an old
[49:49] sassr willingness to to enter into that
[49:53] fellowship and press your way however
[49:55] you need to get there then then even
[49:58] Christ even though Christ gives it to
[50:00] you and offers it to you you'll never
[50:02] know its full reality amen you'll be
[50:06] born
[50:08] again your Gene will still have come to
[50:10] life you still will never come to the
[50:13] Judgment because you've passed from
[50:14] Death to life we're not talking about
[50:15] that now we're talking about acquisition
[50:19] of all the promises of God
[50:22] wow
[50:24] amen so this is why we see Jesus repeat
[50:29] his promise
[50:31] see
[50:33] uh it's because that and and and and
[50:37] that's why he calls it to rest twice
[50:40] twice he first calls you to a rest of
[50:42] the Holy Ghost come unto me all ye that
[50:45] are weary and heavy laden I will give
[50:47] you rest and then he goes on learn of me
[50:50] take my yoke upon you amen see learn of
[50:54] me my yoke is easy my burden is light
[50:56] and so so th this is this is that
[50:59] wondering star brother brandham talks
[51:01] about Sons and Daughters of God just
[51:03] wondering Stars I I don't want to go too
[51:05] far down this Trail I'll be there
[51:07] probably on
[51:08] Sunday but there there came a call and
[51:12] you heard an eagle
[51:14] scream and you responded to the word and
[51:17] brother brandham said oh wondering star
[51:20] come home what are you doing out there
[51:22] why are you hanging out in the world
[51:24] come home wondering star
[51:27] but even when that happens this child
[51:30] you know must have this deeper uh and
[51:33] very personal uh appropriated rest that
[51:36] is to abide in him that does abide in
[51:38] him and it's to be made use of it's to
[51:41] be put it's to be put in action it's
[51:44] that's why it's hearing recognizing and
[51:46] acting so you know he so now he says not
[51:51] only come unto
[51:54] me but he says take my yoke amen upon
[51:58] you and learn of me yield yourself to my
[52:04] training
[52:05] amen submit everything of your will to
[52:11] me let your whole life be one with me
[52:16] and this is why St John 15 is abide in
[52:21] me amen see this is why Matthew 11 and
[52:25] St John 15
[52:27] intersect because Jesus is saying to his
[52:31] disciples without me you can do nothing
[52:33] if ye abide in me and I abide in you
[52:36] then you will ask what you will why is
[52:38] that true because you'll be operating
[52:39] the mind of Christ and it won't be you
[52:41] doing it you'll be living up in those
[52:43] High atmospheres and God can trust you
[52:45] and God can operate that through you and
[52:47] I see so you see the
[52:52] connection so we're yielding ourself and
[52:54] then he then you see when you yield
[52:57] yourself and you submit your will and
[53:00] you allow your whole life to become one
[53:02] with his then you are abiding in him
[53:05] he's abiding in you and then he adds not
[53:08] only uh will I give but ye shall find
[53:14] amen amen you shall find rest for your
[53:18] souls
[53:21] Hallelujah the rest he gave at the
[53:23] beginning of your journey
[53:27] becomes
[53:28] something
[53:30] that you have made it your very
[53:35] own and you know you if you think about
[53:38] abiding in Christ and abiding with him
[53:41] that that is to say Christ dwelling
[53:44] within your heart I
[53:46] mean just just let your mind for a
[53:49] moment think about and I thought about
[53:52] this I thought about this this point
[53:53] right here for weeks
[53:56] and I thought goodness what was the look
[54:00] at the stark
[54:03] contrast of of when the disciples had
[54:07] Jesus with them on the outside versus
[54:11] after the upper room and they had him on
[54:13] the inside
[54:15] amen when they had him on the
[54:18] outside my goodness they they wanted to
[54:22] call fire down from heaven on
[54:23] unbelievers
[54:27] when they only had Jesus on the on on on
[54:30] the outside uh you know they they
[54:34] they're they're within their Inner
[54:36] Circle they they they're you know
[54:38] they're they're they're trying to figure
[54:40] out and they're trying to argue over
[54:42] who's the greatest Among Us amen and
[54:45] Jesus had to rebuke them so you're
[54:47] acting like a bunch of
[54:49] Gentiles see Gentiles have a problem
[54:52] with that amen so don't be like a
[54:55] gentile say I am no you're a Christian
[54:58] see
[55:00] amen oh yeah when they had him on the
[55:03] outside they're trying to call fire down
[55:06] on
[55:07] unbelievers and and and the reason that
[55:09] I talk about this Inner Circle is
[55:11] because I don't want you to to just go
[55:13] in your mind to say yeah yeah that's
[55:16] just kind of the way we are toward other
[55:18] people no hold on he went he went deeper
[55:21] than out there he went right in this
[55:22] Inner Circle he went right into this
[55:24] church and and said you you guys are
[55:27] arguing over who's the greatest yeah
[55:29] amen cuz that's what happens to a family
[55:33] to a church to a marriage to anything
[55:36] when Christ is just an acquaintance on
[55:38] the
[55:39] outside someone you know
[55:42] about see that's different than knowing
[55:44] him amen see so so I mean my goodness
[55:49] they they they they they were jostling
[55:52] and and posturing for seating position
[55:56] the
[55:57] throne oh I want to sit on your left
[55:59] hand I want to sit on your right well my
[56:00] mama said she wants me to sit on the
[56:02] right and well my mama said she wants me
[56:03] to sit over here and Jesus has had to
[56:05] say none of y'all even know what you're
[56:07] talking about that's not even mine to
[56:09] give can you drink the cup that I'm
[56:11] going to drink oh yeah we can do it okay
[56:14] we'll
[56:17] see they all ran for the hills in the
[56:19] garden when he was being
[56:22] arrested Peter denied him openly at his
[56:25] trial and and lied and cursed that he
[56:27] didn't even know him am I was talking to
[56:31] brother Dale uh yesterday or day before
[56:34] brother Dale was telling me about a
[56:35] sermon he preached about took that and
[56:36] he said man can you believe that Peter
[56:39] is trying to say I don't even know him
[56:41] it's like Peter how what do you mean you
[56:43] don't know him how how you don't
[56:45] remember him I mean he he healed your
[56:49] mother just by putting his hand on her
[56:52] you saw him walk on
[56:54] water you he handed you bread and Loaves
[56:58] and you fed 5,000 people what do you
[57:00] mean you don't know him how do you don't
[57:03] know
[57:04] him but that's what
[57:07] happens you forget what the Lord means
[57:09] to you very easily when you only have
[57:13] him as an acquaintance on the
[57:18] outside Thomas disbelieved he was raised
[57:22] from the dead my goodness even when he
[57:24] heard eyewitnesses telling people he
[57:26] trusted and Jesus had even said he would
[57:29] do
[57:31] that and yet Thomas is doubting him see
[57:34] you see the difference versus after
[57:37] after that the Holy Ghost came in the
[57:39] upper room so friends it was never it
[57:42] wasn't about you know who who fished
[57:44] with him and who hunted with him or who
[57:46] knew the prophet or who didn't it's
[57:49] never been about that is do you know him
[57:51] the author of Life they said brother
[57:54] Bram you don't know your Bible he said
[57:56] but I know the author very well
[57:58] Hallelujah and that's I want to know him
[58:01] and the and the power of His that I may
[58:03] know him and the power of His
[58:05] Resurrection being in and the fellowship
[58:07] of his sufferings being made conformable
[58:10] unto his death if that I might attain
[58:12] unto
[58:15] see even Elisha needed the god of Elijah
[58:18] to have any real Authority in the
[58:20] miraculous amen Elisha had followed
[58:23] Elijah but he couldn't open the water
[58:26] he didn't have that same ability you
[58:29] know what that's the same thing I mean
[58:31] every minister of the message of this
[58:34] hour that's his example because Elisha
[58:39] had to prove that in his ministry his
[58:42] ministry was the continuation of
[58:45] Elijah's Ministry and the proof of it
[58:47] was that it would also open the water
[58:49] because Jordan meant death so it so it's
[58:52] divid it's separating death and allowing
[58:54] people to cross over into new life if my
[58:56] Ministry couldn't bring people from
[58:58] spiritual death into the living light
[59:00] and the realities of the Holy Ghost then
[59:02] I could never call myself an ordained
[59:04] minister but the very fact that we can
[59:07] preach and we can see the Sinners come
[59:09] to Christ and get a real New Birth and
[59:11] and young people be filled with the Holy
[59:13] Ghost then we know we have the
[59:15] continuation of that Ministry amen and
[59:18] they said that when they saw Elijah
[59:20] Elisha do that he said the spirit of
[59:21] Elijah to thr on him
[59:23] Hallelujah say well I I I've I've got
[59:26] the spirit of William brandham on me
[59:28] because the spirit of Elijah brother
[59:29] brandom said the Elijah of this day is
[59:32] the Lord Jesus Christ amen just use as
[59:36] human vessels right
[59:41] see so there's a lot to be said
[59:46] about about
[59:49] obedience because that's the real secret
[59:51] of
[59:52] power in fact is I
[59:57] in my Bible Spurgeon wrote here I've got
[59:58] it it's a copy of his own hand where he
[1:00:00] wrote
[1:00:02] it he said
[1:00:04] we not only know rest from the guilt of
[1:00:07] sin this he gives us but we shall rest
[1:00:12] in the Peace of Holiness which we find
[1:00:16] through obedience to
[1:00:18] him so there is a peace that comes in
[1:00:23] Holiness that you are in obedience to
[1:00:26] him I'm glad he saved me I'm glad he I'm
[1:00:30] born again I'm glad I had a gene of God
[1:00:32] I'm glad for this message but I want a
[1:00:35] rest I want the kind of peace that only
[1:00:37] comes from obedience and Holiness
[1:00:39] Hallelujah friends oh break free from
[1:00:42] this world you're you're not here for
[1:00:44] that that's not why that's not why you
[1:00:45] were redeemed you were redeemed to know
[1:00:48] him in the power of his resurrection
[1:00:52] amen it's interesting because
[1:00:56] a lot of times people when you when you
[1:00:58] get on obedience as if I wasn't already
[1:01:01] making it a little uncomfortable now
[1:01:03] we're going to turn it up even another
[1:01:05] notch oh wow now we're going to get down
[1:01:07] to obedience can I just say to you that
[1:01:12] it occurred to me as I was thinking
[1:01:13] about this some some days
[1:01:16] ago that it was only after the
[1:01:19] fall that obedience became a a
[1:01:22] collection of laborous works for man to
[1:01:25] do
[1:01:27] after the fall Works become something
[1:01:31] actually after the fall Works become
[1:01:34] something that can determine someone's
[1:01:37] Destiny and works become a a laborous
[1:01:40] thing but that was only after the
[1:01:43] fall because before the fall obedience
[1:01:46] was in
[1:01:47] love
[1:01:49] see um Z is that you honey give me uh
[1:01:53] give me um revelation chapter
[1:01:58] 20 uh Revelation 20 let's
[1:02:02] start uh at a at verse
[1:02:05] 11 all right and I saw a great white
[1:02:09] throne and him that sat on it from whose
[1:02:12] face the earth and the heaven fled away
[1:02:15] and there was found no place for them
[1:02:19] and I saw the dead small and great stand
[1:02:22] before God and the books were opened and
[1:02:26] another book was opened which is The
[1:02:28] Book of Life and the dead were judged
[1:02:31] out of those things which were written
[1:02:32] in the books according to their
[1:02:36] works now thank God the bride is not
[1:02:38] standing at this judgment because she's
[1:02:41] already been redeemed in Christ and he
[1:02:43] was already judged for her see so he he
[1:02:47] brother brandham said God judged him as
[1:02:51] a sinner he who knew no sin he who never
[1:02:53] committed a sin say well then how' he
[1:02:55] get judged as a sinner because he took
[1:02:57] your sin yes amen he had never committed
[1:03:00] a sin he he knew no sin but the Bible
[1:03:03] says he became sin and and brother Bram
[1:03:06] says and God judged him as a sinner and
[1:03:08] sent him to hell and I'm I I tell you
[1:03:11] something friends that gives me no joy
[1:03:12] to say but what does give me joy is he
[1:03:15] went so I don't ever have to go
[1:03:17] Hallelujah and he rose and ascended up
[1:03:20] on high and now I have his life living
[1:03:22] in me and I passed from Death to life I
[1:03:24] can never come to the judgment
[1:03:27] am but the world now are being judged
[1:03:31] according to their Works see if if
[1:03:33] because if they're just works you know
[1:03:36] listen I if if it's just works without
[1:03:41] out an
[1:03:43] experience then that's judged as
[1:03:45] iniquity in Matthew
[1:03:48] 25 cuz that's what those try to claim
[1:03:50] hey we did all these things in your name
[1:03:53] and Jesus said your hearts are full of
[1:03:54] iniquity I never even knew
[1:03:56] you see so works for the sake of works
[1:03:59] and that that's why the whole world has
[1:04:01] missed that whole point the whole thing
[1:04:03] is not about works works are never
[1:04:05] supposed to be a labor it's it's works
[1:04:08] of love it's labors of Love am
[1:04:14] see when we take the Bible as a
[1:04:19] whole all the obedience that we see in
[1:04:24] chapter and verse from Genesis to
[1:04:27] Revelation was
[1:04:29] always to be an expression of deep
[1:04:35] love Psalms chapter 1
[1:04:39] Z probably one of the most familiar
[1:04:41] Psalms too the whole world other than
[1:04:43] maybe the 23rd psalm Psalms chapter 1
[1:04:45] veres 1 and two blessed is the man that
[1:04:48] walketh not in the counsel of the
[1:04:50] ungodly nor standeth in the way of
[1:04:52] Sinners nor sth in the seat of the
[1:04:54] scornful catch it verse two
[1:04:56] but his
[1:04:57] Delight is in the law of the Lord and in
[1:05:01] his law does he meditate day and night
[1:05:04] that doesn't sound like somebody being
[1:05:05] forced into something that doesn't sound
[1:05:08] like somebody grinding over the law this
[1:05:10] is somebody who loves God's law and
[1:05:13] God's word is a delight to their heart
[1:05:16] see David's whole anguish was when he
[1:05:19] failed to keep that
[1:05:21] law this is why I don't know if you have
[1:05:24] it Zoe the NLT version back there I'm
[1:05:27] just going to read it if you got it you
[1:05:29] can catch up to me Psalms 1 veres 1 to3
[1:05:32] from the NLT listen to this all the joys
[1:05:37] of those who do not follow the advice of
[1:05:40] the wicked are stand around with Sinners
[1:05:43] or join in with mockers but they Delight
[1:05:47] in the law of the Lord meditating on it
[1:05:50] day and night they are like trees
[1:05:52] planted along the riverbank bearing
[1:05:55] fruit each each season their leaves
[1:05:57] never wither and they prosper in all
[1:06:01] that they do
[1:06:04] amen see just as
[1:06:08] I have a desire to perform the works
[1:06:14] that I perform as a a husband or to take
[1:06:17] care of a wife and to provide for
[1:06:20] children and a family and and and and
[1:06:22] and and you know as as a husband to be
[1:06:25] to be faithful to be helpful to be
[1:06:29] caring as I live a a life of service for
[1:06:33] my wife you think that's a that's a
[1:06:35] labor there's lots of labor involved in
[1:06:37] it but it's a joy amen what what father
[1:06:43] you know goes to work and goes to the
[1:06:44] grocery store and and says oh my
[1:06:46] goodness all my heart earned money I got
[1:06:48] to spend to feed all of these kids there
[1:06:50] are wretched men in the world who do
[1:06:52] that and walk out on their family but
[1:06:54] that's not a real man a real man who
[1:06:56] loves his wife and loves his home and
[1:06:58] loves his children loves his family
[1:07:00] loves his grandchildren he'll go to the
[1:07:02] end of the world they can take
[1:07:03] everything he's got and he'll love it
[1:07:05] and
[1:07:07] smile I said
[1:07:15] grandchildren preacher should speak the
[1:07:19] truth I'm glad I have honest
[1:07:21] grandchildren they'd take me to the
[1:07:22] cleaners
[1:07:27] this is the kind of obedience that
[1:07:31] actually gives you access to the tree of
[1:07:33] life amen that was what was happening in
[1:07:36] the garden see it it it it was the in
[1:07:39] fact is it was The Obedience was the one
[1:07:42] requirement for living in the
[1:07:44] garden obedience was the one requirement
[1:07:47] for abiding in the garden as soon as
[1:07:50] they stopped obeying they had to leave
[1:07:52] amen you understand so obedience brings
[1:07:55] forth Holiness but it's not laborous
[1:07:58] it's not a hardship Jesus said take my
[1:08:02] yoke upon upon you my burden my yoke is
[1:08:05] is easy my burden is light amen see so
[1:08:09] it's a labor of love we find that that
[1:08:12] that where does it come from it comes
[1:08:13] from a fountain that Springs up within
[1:08:16] you that's the fountain that I read to
[1:08:19] you in the beginning that you have been
[1:08:21] connected back to that Eternal Fountain
[1:08:24] Hallelujah and God was that great
[1:08:27] fountain in the eternities this is why
[1:08:29] John says Jesus said in John 4:10 Jesus
[1:08:32] answered and said unto her if thou
[1:08:34] knewest the gift of God and who it is
[1:08:38] that saith to thee give me to drink thou
[1:08:40] would have asked of him and he would
[1:08:43] have given thee Living Water John 7:37
[1:08:47] to39 in the in the in the last day that
[1:08:50] great day of the feast Jesus stood and
[1:08:52] cried saying if any man thirst let him
[1:08:55] come unto me and drink he that believeth
[1:08:58] on me as the scripture hath said out of
[1:09:02] his belly shall flow rivers of Living
[1:09:05] Water amen see but this spake he of the
[1:09:09] spirit which they that believe on him
[1:09:11] should receive for the Holy Ghost is not
[1:09:13] yet given because that Jesus was not yet
[1:09:14] glorified so as far you know as as
[1:09:18] serving God you know as far as serving
[1:09:21] God by by disconnected works I mean I I
[1:09:25] don't want to stand on that day then
[1:09:28] trying to stand on works why would I do
[1:09:30] it
[1:09:31] now I don't want to try that then why
[1:09:33] would I try it now don't you're not
[1:09:35] going to want to try it then don't try
[1:09:37] it now it's not about that kind of works
[1:09:39] come back to the Fountain and be
[1:09:44] reconnected come into Christ and cease
[1:09:46] from your Works he says and I will give
[1:09:50] you rest for soul
[1:09:56] this is
[1:09:58] exactly why truth and blessing that
[1:10:03] comes from
[1:10:05] Christ is fully realized and is only
[1:10:08] fully realized by your willingness to
[1:10:12] abide in Christ amen
[1:10:18] amen I'm not saying
[1:10:21] that you know I mean if you're born
[1:10:23] again of the spirit of God I'm not
[1:10:25] saying that that you can't uh to some
[1:10:27] degree realize the blessings of God the
[1:10:30] L because hey look the Lord's not going
[1:10:32] to be defeated you've already passed
[1:10:34] from Death to life he said I will not
[1:10:36] lose one of them so blessed be the name
[1:10:39] of the Lord this isn't about losing your
[1:10:42] Eternal destination this isn't about
[1:10:44] getting born again and then getting
[1:10:46] unborn again there's no such a thing of
[1:10:48] that in the Bible we're not talking
[1:10:50] about that we're talking about coming
[1:10:52] and taking a yoke upon you and learning
[1:10:54] of him and being trained by him and have
[1:10:56] a willingness to grow in Christ
[1:11:04] amen there is so much
[1:11:07] value in abiding in
[1:11:10] Christ to maximize every potential that
[1:11:15] God has for you and I both in this world
[1:11:18] and in the world to come do you
[1:11:20] understand fre friends this is why I
[1:11:22] said to you I think in and it must have
[1:11:24] been part one or two I think I've said
[1:11:26] it several times that the spirit of the
[1:11:28] Lord knows that the saving of your soul
[1:11:32] is more than just making a mental
[1:11:35] decision amen because he knows it's more
[1:11:38] than that so he comes for your heart
[1:11:41] it's it's about experiencing God's very
[1:11:43] life entering our hearts brother Brandon
[1:11:46] would call it two omnipotence
[1:11:48] meeting amen speaking of a gene of God
[1:11:51] they they unite and they stay United
[1:11:53] forever in in that perfect
[1:11:57] Oneness I got a few minutes left you
[1:11:59] good
[1:12:01] amen so we ask you and we've asked
[1:12:04] several times see and now I hope I I
[1:12:07] think probably that you're you're
[1:12:09] grasping why that Jesus would deepen the
[1:12:13] invitation from just come unto me to
[1:12:17] abide in
[1:12:19] me and I think you're coming to grasp
[1:12:23] why he refers to
[1:12:27] twice introspection is a a thing that
[1:12:32] can sometimes make a person very
[1:12:35] uncomfortable but introspection is what
[1:12:37] you do every time you come into the
[1:12:38] house of God and the Bible Paul
[1:12:41] described it like a mirror and it shows
[1:12:43] you why it's a house of
[1:12:46] judgment I I've had people say to
[1:12:49] me you know I would come to church but
[1:12:52] it's it's just not a it's just not a I
[1:12:55] don't feel good when I come I said why
[1:12:57] not well you know sometimes the
[1:13:00] preaching gets gets really straight and
[1:13:03] hard and it's uncomfortable and I said
[1:13:05] what do you think church is it's a house
[1:13:07] of judgment judgment begins at the house
[1:13:08] of God I'm trying to save your life amen
[1:13:12] amen what you suggest I do Pat you on
[1:13:15] the back and tell you everything will be
[1:13:16] fine and God will understand
[1:13:26] you see Jesus and I I'm not going to go
[1:13:29] much further than this I just want to
[1:13:30] make this point I'm going to set myself
[1:13:32] up for
[1:13:36] Sunday you
[1:13:38] remember when Jesus comes and he says to
[1:13:43] his
[1:13:45] disciples the field is white and harvest
[1:13:48] and I'm going to saving the time to turn
[1:13:50] make you turn and read it you'll
[1:13:52] remember it the field is white and
[1:13:53] harvest pray ye the Lord of the Harvest
[1:13:56] that he sent forth laborers into his
[1:13:59] Vineyard the very next
[1:14:03] chapter and at first when I thought
[1:14:05] about this I thought seems backwards I
[1:14:07] wonder why he did it that way and then
[1:14:08] it occurred to me because a chapter
[1:14:11] later they come to him and say Lord
[1:14:14] teach us how to pray John taught his
[1:14:17] disciples how to pray teach us how to
[1:14:22] pray and I I thought you know
[1:14:26] the first time he ever asked them to
[1:14:29] pray the first time in all four gospels
[1:14:33] that he ever asked them to pray was when
[1:14:35] he said the field is white and the
[1:14:37] Harvest pray ye the lord lord of the
[1:14:38] Harvest that he send forth labors and
[1:14:40] brother Bram said he himself was the
[1:14:42] lord of the Harvest and what he was
[1:14:44] saying to them brother R said what he
[1:14:45] was saying to his disciples is I want to
[1:14:47] do this but I want you to pray and ask
[1:14:49] me to do it why because I want your
[1:14:51] involvement I want your fellowship I
[1:14:53] want I I I the whole the whole world was
[1:14:56] created for you and me the whole thing
[1:14:59] is a kingdom the whole thing is a family
[1:15:02] I'm not Santa Claus I'm I'm the master
[1:15:04] of the whole universe and you're my
[1:15:08] family amen so now you can imag then it
[1:15:11] made sense to me I thought yeah now now
[1:15:14] the disciples are starting to catch on
[1:15:16] this guy is asking us to pray for
[1:15:19] something then I'm going to I'm going to
[1:15:21] probably I better start looking inward
[1:15:24] to make sure I can pull this off
[1:15:26] Lord you better teach me how to pray
[1:15:29] you've asked me to pray but I need you
[1:15:32] to teach me how and you've even told me
[1:15:33] what to pray for I need you to teach me
[1:15:35] how to go about that and the very first
[1:15:39] thing that he teaches them is when you
[1:15:42] pray first acknowledge God our Father
[1:15:46] which art in heaven Hallowed be thy
[1:15:51] name give me my kingdom come and do all
[1:15:54] of my will will be
[1:15:57] done not if you're going to pray to the
[1:15:59] Lord of the Harvest you're not going to
[1:16:00] pray like that not if you're going to
[1:16:02] accept the challenge pray ye the lord of
[1:16:04] the Harvest that he send forth laborers

[1:32:12] Satan and anything that he could
[1:32:13] possibly ever do to you and just a few
[1:32:16] days of making sure you have dedicated
[1:32:20] time with your family it makes a huge
[1:32:22] difference and I know it works because
[1:32:24] it's worked for me and it will work for
[1:32:26] you and then also um my back as you all

[1:34:32] I
[1:34:33] live Lord I love you more
[1:34:39] [Music]
