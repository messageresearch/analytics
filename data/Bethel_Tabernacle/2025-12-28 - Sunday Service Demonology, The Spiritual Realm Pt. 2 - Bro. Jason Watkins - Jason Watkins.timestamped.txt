[35:33] about the same time as usual in the
[35:35] midweek. And um and so um I I I just I
[35:40] go to sleep every night as a watch
[35:41] night. I wake up every morning, Brother
[35:43] Brandham says, every morning I look to
[35:45] see him coming. Is this the morning he
[35:47] might come? My So, you know, I don't we
[35:50] don't do that. And um nothing wrong with
[35:52] it at all. Many churches still do. I
[35:54] still get invited to preach at them
[35:56] sometimes and I do. And uh but we'll
[35:59] just be meeting at our standard time,
[36:00] 700 p.m. And um there will be an
[36:03] abbreviated um song and ministry, very
[36:07] abbreviated, and we'll go straight into
[36:09] the footwashing uh uh communion and
[36:12] footwashing. Amen. Praise the Lord. Just
[36:14] by way of announcement, have that in
[36:16] your mind this week, Wednesday. Amen.
[36:19] Ephesians chapter 6 and I'm just going
[36:23] to catch uh verses 12 and 13.
[36:27] We've been we started a little series
[36:29] actually back before brother Aaron was
[36:31] with us, brother Aaron McGary on
[36:34] demonology in the spiritual realm. Now
[36:37] when brother Brham took his series, he
[36:40] preached it about four different times.
[36:42] One of them the first time he preached
[36:44] it he called it demonology in the
[36:46] physical realm and then he preached the
[36:49] next night I think demonology in the
[36:52] religious realm and then subsequently
[36:54] after that at different locations once
[36:56] in Kentucky I think once in Indiana uh
[36:59] he just preached a sermon called
[37:00] demonology and he didn't do a lot of
[37:02] preaching a little bit but mainly was
[37:04] just uh running prayer lines so uh I'm
[37:07] looking at that at that area in between
[37:11] um because don't imagine that brother
[37:14] Brandham didn't talk about spiritual
[37:16] warfare uh in in high places where we're
[37:20] going to read here in Ephesians 6. So
[37:23] I've got a couple of quotes where
[37:24] brother Brandham is talking about that
[37:26] very thing and so we'll get to that.
[37:28] We're taking part two today of
[37:30] demonology in the spiritual realm.
[37:34] Ephesians chapter 6 verse 12.
[37:41] For we wrestle not against flesh and
[37:43] blood, but against principalities,
[37:47] against powers, against the rulers of
[37:50] the darkness of this world. Now, that's
[37:52] a significant word, the darkness. All
[37:56] right? You'll you'll understand why in a
[37:57] little bit. By the rulers of the
[38:00] darkness of this world against spiritual
[38:03] wickedness in high places.
[38:07] Wherefore take unto you the whole armor
[38:10] of God. You're going to hear a lot about
[38:12] taking all of it, the whole armor of
[38:15] God, that you may be able to withstand
[38:19] in the evil day. So, I think that it's
[38:22] not a stretch to to to say that Paul is
[38:26] suggesting to you that unless you take
[38:29] the whole armor and put it on and
[38:33] utilize it, you're not going to be very
[38:36] successful standing in the evil day.
[38:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:40] &gt;&gt; All right. That you may be able to
[38:43] withstand in the evil day and having
[38:46] done all to stand. All right? So, you're
[38:50] going to want to take on the whole armor
[38:52] of God to be able to withstand in the
[38:56] evil day. And and and when you take on
[39:00] the whole armor of God, that's when it
[39:04] is true of you that you have done all to
[39:08] stand.
[39:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. Once you take on all the armor of
[39:13] God, then it's up to God to keep his
[39:15] word and keep you. Amen. Now, if you
[39:18] don't put on the whole armor of God and
[39:21] you don't utilize it on a daily basis,
[39:24] you can hardly go to God questioning why
[39:26] the enemy has more success in your life
[39:29] than you're comfortable with.
[39:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:33] &gt;&gt; I know that by experience. I've
[39:35] questioned God. And he said, "Well, I
[39:36] told you to put on the whole armor."
[39:38] Well, I did. No, you didn't. Okay. Where
[39:40] didn't I? What about here? H and here.
[39:44] Oh, and here. Uh
[39:47] yeah, my fourth one was Alex, Brother
[39:49] Luther. Okay, Lord. Message received.
[39:52] Amen. Praise the Lord. We all in this
[39:54] together?
[39:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. Let's pray. Father, we
[40:00] have a number of families today who have
[40:03] reported sick, Lord, and the enemy
[40:05] battling them, spiritual forces in the
[40:08] physical realm with sickness. And Lord,
[40:11] we're praying. We're lifting them up in
[40:13] prayer. We're asking for these families,
[40:15] Lord, that you'd give them a touch
[40:16] today. There's various requests that
[40:18] have come in. We think of the request of
[40:20] this man dying in the hospital who's
[40:23] dear to the heart of our brother Donald.
[40:25] Lord, may you have mercy on the case. We
[40:27] commit all of these into your hands now.
[40:30] Lord, the the teaching and preaching of
[40:32] the word today. May it be effective,
[40:35] Lord, in our lives. We commit it to you
[40:37] in Jesus name. Amen. God bless you,
[40:39] friends. You can be seated.
[40:48] I'll go ahead and have my PowerPoint put
[40:50] up.
[40:58] Amen.
[41:04] Demonology,
[41:05] the spiritual realm. This is our opening
[41:09] verse. For we wrestle not against flesh
[41:11] and blood, but against principalities,
[41:14] against powers, against the rulers of
[41:17] the darkness of this world, against
[41:19] spiritual wickedness and high places.
[41:22] Now I will say that in generating this
[41:26] image uh I was very keen to be careful
[41:31] uh in my in my in my prompt um to the
[41:34] LLM that it not uh because I was in a
[41:37] mixed audience of small children and I
[41:40] don't want to give anyone bad dreams.
[41:41] So, even I had to kind of um go in and
[41:44] do some editing myself personally using
[41:47] um using some of the photo photo
[41:49] software and and I'm comfortable with
[41:52] that and and I didn't want to make it
[41:54] too antiseptic
[41:56] because I don't want you to imagine that
[41:59] we're talking about a picnic
[42:01] &gt;&gt; or a trip to Disney World. This is real.
[42:05] And this picture is indeed an accurate
[42:09] depiction of the spiritual warfare.
[42:12] There's angels of light. There's angels
[42:15] of darkness.
[42:17] &gt;&gt; Those angels of darkness can sometimes
[42:19] appear as angels of light. But angels of
[42:22] light don't appear as angels of
[42:23] darkness. I'm here to tell you Jesus
[42:26] Christ is the same yesterday, today, and
[42:28] forever. If you're going to deal with
[42:30] the devil, he's all over the place. He's
[42:32] a liar. He in fact is he's the father of
[42:35] it. You cannot trust him.
[42:38] &gt;&gt; He his H his H his H his H his H his H
[42:38] his H his H his H his H his one desire
[42:40] is to usurp the authority of God. We've
[42:43] been preaching on that to take over the
[42:45] kingdom of God to mount the throne of
[42:47] God in the north and to place himself
[42:51] above you and I the stars of heaven. I
[42:54] just say not on our watch.
[42:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. This is this is spiritual warfare.
[43:02] Brother Brandham uh made this statement.
[43:06] I think I have this in my PowerPoint. I
[43:08] hope I do. Um see if I can get it to uh
[43:12] let me turn it off and turn it back on.
[43:14] And if this doesn't get it, we'll let
[43:16] you guys rotate it for us. You're going
[43:18] to have to do that. It's not not
[43:19] functioning. So, we'll let powers it at
[43:21] B. Worry about that. Sarah, if you'll
[43:24] There you go. Um no, go back to the
[43:26] title screen. I I was worried that I
[43:28] didn't get this one in there and I
[43:29] didn't. So, let me just read it to you.
[43:34] Oh, I realize now why I didn't have it
[43:36] in my PowerPoint. It's because that this
[43:38] is from the conclusion of part one that
[43:41] we took before we took a break with
[43:44] special meetings. And I read to you,
[43:46] Brother Brandham, from 1954 in Acts of
[43:49] the Holy Spirit. I tell you, Peter
[43:52] preached a sermon on the day of
[43:53] Pentecost and 3,000 souls were saved.
[43:56] The devil never even moved out of his
[43:59] bed. That's right. Oh well, let them
[44:01] alone. See, but he So, he's he's
[44:04] literally doing like Isaiah and reading
[44:06] the thoughts and intents of the heart.
[44:08] The devil just said, "Oh, just let him
[44:10] alone." Right? But he passed but when uh
[44:13] the next day see uh but he passed
[44:17] through the gate called beautiful the
[44:18] next day and healed a man crippled from
[44:21] his mother's womb and all hell turned
[44:25] loose on him. So So Satan and I was
[44:29] making this point last time and I'm just
[44:31] recapping a very short amount because I
[44:32] got material I want to cover. I don't
[44:34] want to run out of time, but we were
[44:36] pointing out to you last time that Satan
[44:38] knew full well what he was facing. And
[44:42] he's not a dummy. He understands the day
[44:46] and hour that you live in better than
[44:48] you think he does. And there's there's
[44:51] elements of God and his family that he's
[44:54] aware OF MECHANICALLY. HE DOESN'T QUITE
[44:57] GET HE DOESN'T QUITE GET HOW IT ALL
[44:59] FUNCTIONS. HE DOESN'T UNDERSTAND. I
[45:01] THINK THAT IT MUST BAFFLE him uh that
[45:04] that WE'RE STILL STANDING WITH FULL
[45:07] FAITH AND THAT WE'RE STILL MARCHING TO
[45:10] ZION and that and that THE MORE HE TRIES
[45:13] TO harm us, the more determined we
[45:16] become. THE HARDER IT GETS, THE more we
[45:19] dig in. So, it's it's AS IF SATAN CAN'T
[45:22] WIN FOR LOSING. THE POOR GUY COULD
[45:24] PROBABLY WIN IF HE WASN'T ALWAYS LOSING.
[45:28] I'M GLAD HE'S LOSING AT MY HANDS. I HOPE
[45:30] YOU'RE GLAD HE'S LOOKING AT YOU HANDS.
[45:32] I'D LIKE TO SEE HIM LOSE MORE.
[45:36] &gt;&gt; I'd like TO SEE HIM LOSE IN OUR HOMES
[45:38] AND our lives and OUR CHURCH AND THIS
[45:40] ASSEMBLY AND OUR PERSONAL LIVES AND IN
[45:42] OUR HOMES AND IN OUR CHILDREN. BUT I'M
[45:44] HERE TO TELL YOU IT REQUIRES UH
[45:47] DISCIPLINE to take THE WHOLE armor of
[45:50] God and use it.
[45:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:54] &gt;&gt; See, and it's got to be used properly.
[45:58] So, Satan knew once he saw that man
[46:01] healed at the gate, beautiful, he knew
[46:03] right away that the acts of the Holy
[46:05] Ghost was now moving in the bride with
[46:09] the same power that he had dealt with in
[46:12] Jesus. And I AND I MADE A STATEMENT TO
[46:14] YOU LAST TIME THAT SATAN WOULD never
[46:18] again after that after that moment when
[46:20] he slept through the upper room
[46:21] experience. HE WOULD NEVER AGAIN COME UP
[46:25] short and UNDERESTIMATE THE BRIDE. HE
[46:29] WENT INTO OVERDRIVE AND HE IS IN
[46:31] OVERTIME and he IS HE IS PEDAL TO THE
[46:34] METAL. HE IS NOT AND AND I'M HERE TO
[46:37] TELL YOU, YOU NEED to be NOT UNAWARE OF
[46:40] HIS DEVICES. YOU NEED TO STUDY YOUR
[46:42] ENEMY. THIS IS REAL. THIS IS WAR.
[46:45] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[46:47] &gt;&gt; I SAID THAT TO YOU LAST TIME AS A
[46:48] CLOSING STATEMENT. THIS IS WAR.
[46:51] &gt;&gt; And I don't plan to lose it.
[46:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:54] &gt;&gt; I know him, too.
[46:57] &gt;&gt; He won't never make that mistake about
[47:00] who we are. And I'm never, the bride is
[47:02] never going to make the mistake of who
[47:04] he is. I'm glad that God has revealed to
[47:06] us who he who he has been in the
[47:10] religious realm and we're not. Think of
[47:13] it today, friends. YOU SAY, UH, DON'T
[47:16] AND DON'T TAKE IT FOR GRANTED. DON'T
[47:19] JUST DON'T JUST GLOSS over the fact that
[47:23] YOU ARE NOT deceived by the Antichrist
[47:26] spirit in modern Christianity.
[47:29] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[47:30] &gt;&gt; SAY, WHY SHOULDN'T I JUST WHY WHY IS
[47:32] THAT SUCH A BIG DEAL? DO YOU REALIZE
[47:35] THAT YOU'RE LESS THAN 1% PROBABLY AROUND
[47:38] the world of TWO AND A HALF ALMOST THREE
[47:41] BILLION PEOPLE IN CHRISTIANITY AND
[47:45] YOU'RE PART OF A SMALL SLIVER OF
[47:47] HUMANITY THAT IS NOT THE BIBLE SAYS THE
[47:50] WHOLE WORLD WILL WORSHIP THE BEAST NOT
[47:55] JUST CHRISTIANS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT
[47:57] MUSLIMS HINDUS SIKHS JAMES ALL OF THEM
[48:00] THE WHOLE WORLD WILL FOLLOW AFTER THE
[48:03] BEAST The bride IS THE ONLY ONE, NOT
[48:06] EVEN THE NOT EVEN THE FOOLISH VIRGIN
[48:08] FULLY GET IT NOW. ONLY AFTER THE RAPTURE
[48:11] DO THEY COME TO THEIR SENSES AND PULL
[48:13] OUT OF THAT THING.
[48:14] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[48:15] &gt;&gt; SO, SO DON'T LET IT BE A SMALL THING IN
[48:18] your mind that YOU ARE A SMALL
[48:21] INSIGNIFICANT PART OF THIS ECONOMY UH
[48:25] THAT WE SEE IN THE WORLD. I'M HERE TO
[48:27] TELL YOU, YOU'RE THE ONLY RELEVANT PART.
[48:30] EVERYTHING THAT IS HAPPENING IS BASED
[48:32] UPON GOD'S PLAN OF REDEMPTION FOR YOU
[48:34] AND ME.
[48:35] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[48:36] &gt;&gt; AND HIS BRIDE AROUND THE EARTH.
[48:38] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[48:40] &gt;&gt; So this is UH THIS IS FULLON. I WANT YOU
[48:43] TO KNOW THAT EVERYTHING I JUST SAID,
[48:45] SATAN IS AWARE OF. HE'S full on.
[48:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:49] &gt;&gt; We're not deceived. Our eyes have been
[48:51] open. We know his plans. We know his
[48:54] tactics. I'm glad that we are
[48:56] predestinated to not fall. There's got
[48:59] to be an Eve. And I I made up my mind
[49:02] years ago that I want to be part of that
[49:05] second Eve that proves at the end time
[49:07] we're not like the first one. The the
[49:10] second Adam came and proved HE WAS NOT
[49:13] LIKE THE FIRST ONE. THERE'S GOT TO BE A
[49:15] a a second Eve that proves IF SHE'S ONLY
[49:17] ONE IN A MILLION, THAT'S ALL GOD NEEDS
[49:20] IS ONE IN A MILLION TO PROVE THE DEVIL
[49:23] IS A LIAR. AMEN.
[49:25] &gt;&gt; SEE, SO JUST AS BROTHER BRANDHAM WOULD
[49:28] WOULD SAY, THERE'S NEVER BEEN A MAN LIKE
[49:30] JESUS, so Satan has never faced a bride
[49:34] in any age like this bride. Don't don't
[49:36] don't let that lo leave your mind,
[49:38] friends, because because you you if you
[49:42] if you understand this is this is the
[49:44] secret of real power. This is why
[49:46] Brother Brandham would say things like,
[49:49] "When the bride recognizes who she is,
[49:52] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. see that she can do the
[49:55] greater works. That's when she's an
[49:57] invincible army. SO, CAN I SAY IT LIKE
[50:00] THIS? NOT TO ADD TO WHAT A PROPHET SAID,
[50:02] BUT JUST JUST LET ME PUT IT TO YOU IN
[50:04] SOME OF MY OWN LANGUAGE. WHEN WHEN THE
[50:06] BRIDE RECOGNIZES WHAT SATAN ALREADY
[50:09] KNOWS.
[50:10] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[50:11] &gt;&gt; Satan already knows who YOU ARE. THAT'S
[50:14] WHY HE'S SO DETERMINED TO TRIP YOU UP.
[50:17] NOW, HE CANNOT COME AGAINST YOU HEAD ON.
[50:20] THAT'S BEEN TRIED. THAT DOESN'T WORK.
[50:23] CHRIST DEFEATED HIM IN HEAVEN. THE HOLY
[50:25] GHOST DEFEATS HIM IN THE EARTH. NOW,
[50:27] HE'S NOT GOING TO COME AT YOU HEAD ON,
[50:28] NOT AT GOD'S FAMILY TRYING TO DISSUADE
[50:31] YOU FROM THE GLORIOUS TRUTH OF THIS
[50:33] HOUR. THAT'S NOT HIS ATTEMPT. HE DOESN'T
[50:36] HAVE TO DO THAT AS LONG AS HE CAN
[50:38] OUTFLANK YOU AND GET YOU IN IN A STATE
[50:41] OF WEAKENED SPIRITUAL CONDITION SO THAT
[50:44] HE CAN COME INTO YOUR HOMES, WRECK YOUR
[50:47] CHILDREN, COME INTO YOUR HOMES, WRECK
[50:49] YOUR MARRIAGE, COME INTO YOUR HOMES,
[50:51] WRECK A CHURCH, WRECK MINISTRIES. IT
[50:54] DOESN'T MATTER IF HE IF HE IF HE CAN'T
[50:56] DESTROY YOU ETERNALLY FROM THE LAMB'S
[50:59] BOOK OF LIFE. IF HE CAN JUST STOP YOU
[51:01] FROM DISPOSSESSING HIM AT THE END TIME,
[51:04] HE STILL HAS A CHANCE IN HIS OWN MIND.
[51:07] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[51:08] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[51:10] &gt;&gt; SO THIS IS WHY BROTHER BRANDHAM,
[51:13] you know, WOULD WOULD MAKE THIS SO CLEAR
[51:15] THAT THAT THE BRIDE IS, YOU KNOW, SHE'S
[51:19] NOT JUST STANDING. WHEN HE saw the
[51:22] vision of the of the preview of the
[51:24] bride, she wasn't standing. She was
[51:27] marching. now. And and and NOT ONLY IS
[51:30] SHE MARCHING, she's ascending
[51:35] &gt;&gt; already. ALREADY SHE'S ASCENDING. BUT
[51:39] YOU KNOW, BEFORE WE GO OFF WORLD IN THE
[51:41] RAPTURE, um you know,
[51:45] or at least a faster dimension, however
[51:47] you want to say it, uh to meet the Lord
[51:49] in the air. LET'S NOT FORGET THAT WE ARE
[51:54] RIGHT NOW IN A BATTLE.
[51:56] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[51:56] &gt;&gt; And I'm in it to win it. AMEN.
[51:59] &gt;&gt; SEE, ON A DAILY BASIS,
[52:02] &gt;&gt; I KNOW I'LL WIN ULTIMATELY, BUT I WANT
[52:04] TO WIN TODAY AND TOMORROW AND THE NEXT
[52:07] DAY.
[52:08] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[52:08] &gt;&gt; SEE, I WANT THAT WHEN I WHEN I CROSS THE
[52:11] LINE ON THAT FINAL MORNING, AND I GOT
[52:12] SOME MORE TO SAY ABOUT IT SHORTLY. BUT I
[52:14] I WANT TO BE I WANT TO BE AT FULL PRESS,
[52:18] FULL STEAM. I WANT TO BE WIDE OPEN. I
[52:21] WANT TO BE TRAMPLING EVIL SPIRITS AND
[52:24] PUTTING THEM UNDER MY FEET WHERE THEY
[52:27] BELONG. I DON'T WANT GOD TO BE A A A
[52:30] COAST GUARD RESCUE CHOPPER TO BARELY GET
[52:32] ME INTO THE RAPTURE. OH NO, FRIENDS. I
[52:34] WANT TO HEAR THE TRUMPET SOUND. I WANT
[52:36] TO BE GATHERED WITH THE SAINTS OF GOD.
[52:39] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[52:41] So this IS WHAT BROTHER BRANDON WOULD
[52:43] RUN into constantly in demonology in the
[52:47] religious realm. All right. Oh yeah,
[52:50] you're running that for me, sister
[52:51] Sarah. So, let's go to my first slide.
[52:53] So, Brother Brand, I READ THIS. I QUOTED
[52:55] THIS FOR YOU AND I WANTED TO put it up
[52:57] because this is where Brother Brandham,
[52:59] this was what he dealt with so much in
[53:00] the in the realms of demonology in the
[53:02] religious realm. As people today are
[53:05] trying to say we should wash feet once a
[53:08] year on Thursday and on Friday, we
[53:10] should take the communion and all
[53:12] different doctrines. They argue about
[53:14] whether it should be this day or that
[53:16] day or whether it should be a Sabbath
[53:18] day or the first day of the week. All
[53:21] these things are just merely tradition.
[53:25] Now hold right there, Sarah. They're all
[53:27] just merely tradition. Okay. All right.
[53:31] Now advance. WHAT GOOD WOULD IT DO any
[53:34] of it? It what good would it would any
[53:38] of it do you whether you had Lent?
[53:41] That's a Catholic thing. Lent, whether
[53:43] you had lent or not LENT IF THERE WAS NO
[53:45] LIFE IN YOU. IT'S ONLY A MEMORIAL, WHICH
[53:48] THERE'S NOTHING AGAINST IT, BUT THEY
[53:50] HAVE CERTAINLY CARRIED OUT THEIR
[53:52] TRADITIONS. BUT NOTICE WHAT I HAVE
[53:54] UNDERLINED. THEY'VE LEFT OFF THE main
[53:57] thing.
[53:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:58] &gt;&gt; NOW, I'M I'M GOING TO GO AGAIN AND I'M
[54:01] GOING TO I'M GOING TO ADD TO THIS
[54:03] STATEMENT.
[54:05] SO, YOU KNOW, THEY ARGUE OVER WHICH
[54:08] MESSAGE CHURCH WE SHOULD GO TO OR WHICH
[54:10] MESSAGE PASTOR IS THE BEST ONE. WE ARGUE
[54:12] ABOUT WHO KNOWS THE QUOTES THE BEST OR
[54:14] WHAT ABOUT THIS DOCTRINE OR WHAT ABOUT
[54:15] THAT DOCTRINE. IT'S ALL FINE. WE'VE GOT
[54:18] CHURCHES AROUND THE WORLD AND WE'VE GOT
[54:19] GREAT MEN OF GOD WHEREVER GOD HAS PLACED
[54:22] YOU. BUT WHAT GOOD WOULD ANY OF IT DO
[54:24] YOU WHETHER YOU HAD WENT TO THIS MESSAGE
[54:27] CHURCH OR ANOTHER MESSAGE CHURCH IF THE
[54:29] LIFE IS NOT IN YOU?
[54:32] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[54:34] SEE,
[54:35] you've left off
[54:37] &gt;&gt; the main thing.
[54:41] All right. SO, BROTHER BRANDHAM DOESN'T
[54:43] NEGLECT, AS I SAID, BY ANY means the
[54:45] over the overarching battles that we
[54:48] face from demonology in the spiritual
[54:50] realm. Uh, and here's one that he's
[54:52] actually um, you know, taking it down to
[54:55] the very plain things of everyday life
[54:56] and and the overcoming power that ought
[54:59] to be in the Holy Ghost. All right,
[55:01] Sarah. Next slide. People today SEEM TO
[55:05] BE SO comfortable in sin
[55:08] BECAUSE WE OWN A NEW CAR, because we can
[55:11] eat three meals a day, sleep on a clean
[55:15] bed. THAT'S WONDERFUL, BUT THAT WOULD BE
[55:18] GOOD. BUT WE FORGET GOD WHEN PROSPERITY
[55:23] comes like that. And here it is. We've
[55:26] left off the main thing. Judgment,
[55:30] righteousness. Here's a main thing.
[55:33] Power of the HOLY GHOST. RESURRECTION,
[55:36] ETERNAL JUDGMENT. I WANT TO BE ABLE I
[55:39] DON'T I DON'T WANT TO FEEL LIKE I HAVE
[55:42] TO WAIT UNTIL AFTER A THOUSAND-YEAR
[55:44] MILLENNIUM AND FINALLY I'M QUALIFIED UH
[55:47] TO JUDGE THE THINGS OF GOD. I'D LIKE TO
[55:49] BE AN ABLE-BODIED JUDGE OF GOD'S WORD
[55:52] RIGHT NOW. HOW I SHOULD LIVE, HOW WE
[55:54] SHOULD CONDUCT OURSELVES AND TO SEE THE
[55:56] ENEMY AND HIS TACTICS AND UNDERSTAND HOW
[55:58] TO DEFEAT HIM. I PROMISE YOU, YOU CAN
[56:00] DEFEAT HIM EVERY SINGLE TIME IF YOU TAKE
[56:03] GOD'S WORD.
[56:04] &gt;&gt; And he will defeat you every single time
[56:07] if you don't because WITHOUT GOD'S WORD,
[56:10] YOU'RE NO MATCH FOR HIM.
[56:11] &gt;&gt; SEE, SO SO THE DAY OF THE RESURRECTION,
[56:16] YOU KNOW, I WANT TO SAY THIS AND ALL
[56:18] RIGHT, SARAH, let's see. Just hold right
[56:19] there, sister until I and I'll give you
[56:22] the next one in a second.
[56:25] So, I WANT TO MAKE THIS STATEMENT TO YOU
[56:28] AND I AND I THOUGHT, WELL, I'M GOING TO
[56:29] HAVE TO REALLY prove this because it's a
[56:32] little bit of a an astonishing
[56:34] statement. At least it was to me as I
[56:36] thought about it.
[56:38] Resurrection morning. Now, I'm going to
[56:41] prove this, so don't throw something at
[56:42] me. Resurrection morning, THE DAY OF THE
[56:47] RESURRECTION. Are you looking forward to
[56:49] that?
[56:51] &gt;&gt; THAT DAY WILL BE A DAY
[56:54] VERY LITTLE different if any at all from
[57:00] every day that we live now.
[57:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:05] &gt;&gt; I don't know what your I know the world
[57:07] is looking for a a some kind of a a a
[57:10] Trump style. You know, here comes Christ
[57:12] down the escalator, down the golden
[57:14] escalator. A angel steps out on a cloud,
[57:17] blows a horn, the whole world hears it,
[57:18] and here comes a golden escalator down,
[57:21] and then Jesus comes down to take
[57:22] everybody home in the rapture. As far as
[57:24] the world is concerned, everybody's
[57:25] going to heaven,
[57:26] &gt;&gt; right?
[57:27] &gt;&gt; I don't even know what what they think
[57:28] hell's just going to be vacated, you
[57:31] know. Uh, you know, so I don't I don't
[57:34] get that kind of thinking. But, you
[57:36] know, when you tell people, you can tell
[57:38] somebody a lie, you tell them what they
[57:40] want to believe, they'll believe that.
[57:42] So people want so desperately to believe
[57:44] they can live any old way and that being
[57:46] a Christian doesn't really mean you have
[57:47] to make any effective changes. And when
[57:49] preachers come along and tell them
[57:50] that's okay, then they go, "Oh, well,
[57:52] okay, good."
[57:53] &gt;&gt; See, and we're talking about two and a
[57:56] half billion nearly that have that
[57:58] attitude. The ones that don't are
[58:01] holiness, foolish virgin, and the bride
[58:04] of Christ.
[58:05] &gt;&gt; See,
[58:07] SO IT WILL BE A DAY VERY LITTLE
[58:10] DIFFERENT. I don't even know based on
[58:13] the quotes I'm about to read. I DON'T
[58:15] REALLY KNOW IF I CAN EVEN indicate to
[58:16] you that it'll be in any way different
[58:19] THAN YOUR EVERYDAY WAKING UP MAKING THE
[58:21] coffee life
[58:23] getting your day getting your day going.
[58:27] the resurrected saints
[58:30] AND OUR BODY CHANGE. When that happens,
[58:34] and this is a this is important,
[58:38] THAT WILL BE OR IT SHOULD be and I
[58:40] believe will be for those who are really
[58:42] ready for it. IT WILL JUST BE A NEXT
[58:46] LITTLE short step
[58:48] &gt;&gt; to a life of overcoming victory and
[58:51] resurrection power you've already been
[58:54] living and demonstrating the day before.
[59:00] &gt;&gt; All right.
[59:02] Let's prove it.
[59:05] Look
[59:07] why them men who had walked with Christ,
[59:10] disciples that walked with him. When you
[59:12] see those three dots, that's me editing
[59:14] out portions. You can go back and get
[59:15] the whole quote. I'm just getting the
[59:17] relative relevant stuff and I'm keeping
[59:19] the flow. Don't don't ever worry about
[59:20] that.
[59:22] LOOK WHY THEM MEN who had walked with
[59:24] Christ,
[59:26] DISCIPLES THAT WALKED WITH HIM, WHY DOES
[59:29] THE SCRIPTURE SAY THAT ELIAS must come
[59:32] first come before these things and
[59:35] restore all things? Jesus said, "He's
[59:38] already come and you didn't know it."
[59:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:43] &gt;&gt; Are you next? Next one. Are you ready? I
[59:47] WANT TO SHOCK you a little bit. The
[59:49] rapture will be the same way.
[59:51] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[59:52] &gt;&gt; IT'LL BE SO SIMPLE. NO DOUBT. IT'LL BE
[59:56] LIKE LIKEWISE TILL THE RAPTURE WILL COME
[59:59] ONE OF THESE days and nobody will know
[1:00:01] nothing about it.
[1:00:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:03] &gt;&gt; Next.
[1:00:04] THE RAPTURE WILL COME IN SUCH A SIMPLE
[1:00:07] WAY till the judgments will fall and
[1:00:10] they'll see the son of man and they'll
[1:00:12] say, "Wasn't we supposed to have such
[1:00:14] and such and wasn't there supposed TO BE
[1:00:16] ELIAS SENT TO US? And wasn't there
[1:00:19] supposed to be a rapture next?" Jesus
[1:00:22] will say, "It's already happened and you
[1:00:26] didn't know it." God in simplicity. See,
[1:00:30] now notice the rapture will be so few go
[1:00:35] in that bride.
[1:00:38] It'll be Now, just let me signal you,
[1:00:41] Sarah, because I want to do this
[1:00:43] deliberatively and slowly.
[1:00:46] It'll be maybe one leave Jeffersonville,
[1:00:51] just somebody come up missing.
[1:00:54] Now, what you're about to see is brother
[1:00:56] Brandon's going to go city, state, you'd
[1:01:00] go nation. No, city, state, continent.
[1:01:05] &gt;&gt; And in a short sentence, now I want to
[1:01:08] say something before we go to our next
[1:01:10] slide. I'm very glad this is in the
[1:01:13] seals. Later in questions and answers on
[1:01:16] the seals, they asked Brother Brandham,
[1:01:18] Brother Bram, you said one there that
[1:01:20] and he's going to he's about to say
[1:01:22] maybe 500 around the world. You said 500
[1:01:24] is only going to go in the rapture. And
[1:01:25] brother Brandon makes it clear. He's
[1:01:27] just using a for instance. He He's not
[1:01:30] saying there would be one out of
[1:01:31] Jeffersonville or one out of Georgia or
[1:01:33] one out of Africa and 500 total. He's
[1:01:36] just simply saying he wants you to think
[1:01:38] ABOUT THIS. WHAT WHAT WHAT WHAT IS HE
[1:01:40] DOING? HE'S WHAT HE'S WHAT I'M DOING
[1:01:41] TODAY. I'M TRYING TO GET YOU TO REALIZE
[1:01:43] IT'S NOT SOME EARTHSHATTERING EVENT.
[1:01:45] IT'S GOING TO BE A DAY. IT'S GOING TO BE
[1:01:47] A MORNING LIKE YOU HAVE EVERY MORNING.
[1:01:49] AND YOU'RE GOING TO STEP INTO A NEW BODY
[1:01:51] CHANGE. WHY? BECAUSE YOU'VE BEEN LIVING
[1:01:53] A DAILY LIFE OF PUTTING ON THE WHOLE
[1:01:55] ARMOR OF GOD, IT WON'T BE MUCH FOR YOU
[1:01:58] TO PUT ON A NEW BODY.
[1:02:01] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:02:04] &gt;&gt; All right, SARAH.
[1:02:06] THEY'LL SAY, "WELL, YOU NEVER THE REST
[1:02:08] OF THEM WON'T KNOW. THERE'LL BE ONE
[1:02:10] LEAVE GEORGIA. There'll be one leave in
[1:02:14] Africa. And and let's LET'S SAY THERE
[1:02:17] WOULD BE 500." SEE, IT'S just he's just
[1:02:19] using as an example. LET'S SAY THERE,
[1:02:22] LISTEN, THERE WAS EIGHT IN THE days of
[1:02:24] Noah.
[1:02:25] &gt;&gt; THERE WAS ONE in the days of Enoch in
[1:02:27] the whole earth.
[1:02:29] &gt;&gt; See,
[1:02:31] &gt;&gt; LET'S SAY THERE WOULD BE 500 PEOPLE.
[1:02:35] Brother Jason, why are you doing it?
[1:02:38] You're drilling holes in us. Why?
[1:02:40] Because I want to get it across to you
[1:02:43] how important it is that you apply
[1:02:46] spiritual warfare and putting on the
[1:02:48] whole armor of God.
[1:02:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm trying to unsettle you because
[1:02:53] I don't want you JUST TO GLOSS IT OVER
[1:02:55] AND TO SAY, "OH, I JUST COME TO A
[1:02:57] MESSAGE CHURCH AND I BELIEVE GOD SENT A
[1:02:59] PROPHET. I'M A CHRISTIAN AND I LOVE
[1:03:00] JESUS." I'M HERE TO TELL YOU ALL THAT'S
[1:03:03] GOOD. ALL THAT'S WONDERFUL. THAT'S A LOT
[1:03:05] OF THERE'S A LOT WHO JUST HOLD THAT AS A
[1:03:07] TRADITION. BUT IF YOU DON'T HAVE THE
[1:03:09] LIFE, WHAT GOOD DOES ANY OF IT DO YOU?
[1:03:15] MY
[1:03:18] &gt;&gt; SO HE SAYS ONE LEAVE GEORGIA THERE BE
[1:03:21] ONE LEAVE AFRICA AND LET'S SAY THERE
[1:03:22] WOULD BE 500 PEOPLE living will go in
[1:03:26] the translation
[1:03:28] that ain't the church this is THE BRIDE
[1:03:30] THE BRIDE HE'S TALKING about next
[1:03:33] the church WILL COME UP BY THE THOUSANDS
[1:03:36] BUT THAT'S IN THE NEXT resurrection
[1:03:37] that's after the millennium see they
[1:03:40] THEY THEY LIVE NOT FOR THE SPACE OF A
[1:03:42] THOUSAND YEARS. BUT IN THE BRIDE, IF 500
[1:03:46] PEOPLE LEFT THE earth this very minute,
[1:03:48] the world would know nothing about it.
[1:03:51] Jesus said there'd be one in the bed and
[1:03:54] I'll take one and I'll leave one now.
[1:03:58] Next, that's at night time. See, THEN
[1:04:01] THEN
[1:04:02] uh they would BE TWO IN THE FIELD. SEE,
[1:04:05] OVER on the other side OF THE EARTH, ON
[1:04:06] THIS SIDE OF THE EARTH, people are
[1:04:07] sleeping. On this side of the earth,
[1:04:09] they're working. SO, THE POINT HE'S
[1:04:11] MAKING IS IT'S GLOBAL.
[1:04:12] &gt;&gt; IT'S ALL GOING TO HAPPEN ONE OF THESE
[1:04:14] MORNINGS. IT'S ALL GOING TO HAPPEN. IT'S
[1:04:16] ALL GOING TO GO FORWARD. I DON'T KNOW IF
[1:04:18] IT IF IT'S GOING TO FOLLOW THE SUN
[1:04:20] AROUND, YOU KNOW, OR OR OR AS THE EARTH
[1:04:22] ROTATES AND THE SUNLIGHT UH COMES AROUND
[1:04:24] THE EARTH AND AND MAYBE IT'LL FOLLOW THE
[1:04:27] TIME ZONES. I DON'T KNOW. I DON'T CARE.
[1:04:28] I JUST WANT TO BE THERE.
[1:04:30] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:04:31] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:04:34] &gt;&gt; SO, HE SAYS,
[1:04:37] let me catch up to MYSELF HERE. THAT'S
[1:04:38] AT NIGHT TIME. They would be two in THE
[1:04:41] FIELD OVER ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE
[1:04:43] EARTH. I'LL TAKE ONE and leave one. As
[1:04:46] it was in the days OF NOAH, SO SHALL IT
[1:04:49] BE IN THE COMING OF THE SON OF MAN.
[1:04:51] NEXT. THINK. Everything
[1:04:55] will move just as common as it can be.
[1:04:59] So you think I'm out on a limb by saying
[1:05:01] it'll be just like the morning before.
[1:05:04] It'll be a secret BECAUSE HE SAID HE'D
[1:05:08] COME LIKE A thief in the night. Next
[1:05:11] slide. He that is in you. THIS IS SIX
[1:05:14] MONTHS LATER or about uh eight months
[1:05:16] later. THE RAPTURE WILL BE SO SUDDEN AND
[1:05:20] SO QUICK THAT THE world will never even
[1:05:24] miss them that they're gone. THEY'LL
[1:05:27] KNOW NOTHING ABOUT IT. HE COMES AND
[1:05:29] SLIPS her way. IT'LL BE GONE. THEY'LL
[1:05:33] KNOW NOTHING ABOUT IT.
[1:05:37] SO YOU CAN SEE WHY WHEN the scripture
[1:05:41] says WE WRESTLE NOT NOW CATCH THIS
[1:05:44] LANGUAGE WE WRESTLE NOT AGAINST FLESH
[1:05:46] AND BLOOD BUT AGAINST PRINCIPALITIES. SO
[1:05:50] SO I CAN SO THE THE LANGUAGE OF THE
[1:05:52] BIBLE IS SAYING WE DO WRESTLE WE JUST
[1:05:55] DON'T WRESTLE AGAINST FLESH AND BLOOD
[1:05:57] BUT WE DO WRESTLE.
[1:05:58] &gt;&gt; AMEN. IT'S NOT, OH, WE DON'T WE DON'T
[1:06:01] WRESTLE AGAINST FLESH AND BLOOD. LET'S
[1:06:02] GO ON VACATION. NO, NO, NO, NO, NO. YOU
[1:06:05] DO WRESTLE AGAINST AND IT'S WORSE. YOU
[1:06:07] YOU'LL WISH THAT YOU ONLY HAD TO WRESTLE
[1:06:09] AGAINST FLESH AND BLOOD. FLESH AND BLOOD
[1:06:12] ARE WHAT NATIONS DO. AND YOU CAN IF
[1:06:14] YOU'VE GOT BIGGER SUPER WEAPONS THAN
[1:06:15] THEY'VE GOT, YOU CAN KILL MORE OF THEM
[1:06:17] THAN THEY CAN KILL OF YOU. BUT THIS IS
[1:06:19] SOMETHING THAT YOUR SUPER WEAPONS DON'T
[1:06:21] WORK ON. THE ONLY WEAPON IS THIS ONE.
[1:06:25] AND THE ONLY WAY YOU CAN EMPLOY ITS
[1:06:28] POWER IS YOU. IT HAS TO BE A LIVING
[1:06:30] REVELATION TO YOU BECAUSE SATAN DON'T
[1:06:32] CARE HOW RELIGIOUS YOU ARE OR EVEN HOW
[1:06:36] RIGHT YOU ARE IN YOUR MENTAL
[1:06:38] UNDERSTANDING of the word and can argue
[1:06:40] it.
[1:06:41] He knows if you don't have the life, you
[1:06:43] won't come up anyway. See, DO YOU
[1:06:46] UNDERSTAND WHY WE EMPHASIZE TO OUR YOUNG
[1:06:49] PEOPLE, YOU HAVE TO HAVE AN EXPERIENCE
[1:06:51] IN THE HOLY GHOST THE SAME AS I HAVE,
[1:06:53] THE SAME AS YOUR PARENTS HAVE, SAME AS
[1:06:55] YOUR GRANDPARENTS HAVE. IT'S IT'S THE
[1:06:57] TOKEN ON DISPLAY OR NOTHING. THERE'S NO
[1:07:01] SECOND PLACE. SECOND PLACE WAITS A
[1:07:03] THOUSAND YEARS.
[1:07:04] &gt;&gt; YES, that's right.
[1:07:07] &gt;&gt; I DON'T INTEND TO COME IN SECOND PLACE.
[1:07:09] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:07:11] SO WE WRESTLE NOT BUT BUT WE DO WRESTLE
[1:07:15] AGAINST PRINCIPALITIES.
[1:07:17] SO OUR THAT'S WHY OUR 13TH VERSE SAID
[1:07:19] WHEREFORE TAKE UNTO YOU THE WHOLE
[1:07:23] THE ALL of thee THE ENTIRE armor of God
[1:07:29] that you may BE ABLE TO WITHSTAND IN the
[1:07:32] evil day AND HAVE DONE ALL TO STAND.
[1:07:36] &gt;&gt; YES. AMEN.
[1:07:40] So it THEN IT BECOMES A QUESTION.
[1:07:50] I think you can take that. That my last
[1:07:52] slide, Sarah? I think. Go to the next
[1:07:54] one. Okay, go back.
[1:07:59] Oh, I didn't I didn't I realize now I
[1:08:01] didn't finish reading the quote. Okay,
[1:08:02] let me let me go back.
[1:08:12] Yes, I realize I don't have it here. I
[1:08:14] have it there. I'm read this again. And
[1:08:16] the rapture will be so sudden, so quick
[1:08:18] that the world will never even miss
[1:08:19] them. That they're gone, right? They'll
[1:08:23] know nothing about it. He comes and
[1:08:25] slips her away. It'll be gone. They'll
[1:08:27] know nothing about it next. maybe in
[1:08:31] this great day of prosperity.
[1:08:34] Uh, that seems out of sync for me and I
[1:08:36] don't not sure why that's out of sync.
[1:08:38] Um, but it's it's okay. I'm going to I'm
[1:08:41] going to go ahead and and read it now
[1:08:42] because I've got a lengthy one that's
[1:08:44] not on the screen. Let's read this.
[1:08:46] Maybe in this great day of prosperity.
[1:08:49] Oh, I see. Now, this is spiritual
[1:08:51] warfare. That we've been so interested
[1:08:54] in prosperity
[1:08:56] till we've left off the main thing. Here
[1:08:58] was another one of my main thing quotes.
[1:09:01] Maybe we have gone off on some kind of a
[1:09:04] tantrum without him.
[1:09:07] Next. Okay. So, SO IT'S ALL ABOUT not
[1:09:13] leaving off the main thing. Say, I'm a
[1:09:15] believer. Okay. But that's not the main
[1:09:17] thing. Well, but I come to church, but
[1:09:21] that's not even the main thing. And some
[1:09:23] don't even do the not main thing.
[1:09:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:27] Well, I I I pray and read my Bible.
[1:09:30] Well, that's a big thing, but that's
[1:09:32] still not the main thing.
[1:09:34] &gt;&gt; The main thing is you must be born
[1:09:38] again. Do you know him in his power and
[1:09:43] conjunction his resurrection?
[1:09:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:46] &gt;&gt; Do you know him in his power and in his
[1:09:48] resurrection? SEE, SO WHEN WE LOOK AT IT
[1:09:52] FROM THAT KIND OF PERSPECTIVE, IT BEGS
[1:09:54] THE QUESTION, what would Satan do? How
[1:09:56] might Satan most effectively prevent us
[1:10:00] today today from accomplishing the
[1:10:03] instructions that we read in that 13th
[1:10:06] verse? Put on the whole armor of God.
[1:10:08] See, um I did I did some some some
[1:10:12] research
[1:10:14] um because and I and it was a narrow
[1:10:16] focus from I just I just decided to keep
[1:10:19] it from the writings and the sermons and
[1:10:20] the commentaries from the ministries uh
[1:10:23] that were connected to the restoration
[1:10:26] of the bride starting with Luther and
[1:10:29] coming forward specifically Luther
[1:10:30] Wesley the early Isuza uh fathers and
[1:10:34] all the way to through to brother Brham
[1:10:37] all the way through to uh the
[1:10:38] dispensational angel that uh that with
[1:10:41] Paul ends up bookending the ages. I hope
[1:10:45] you understand that's what William Brham
[1:10:46] was dispensational messenger. It wasn't
[1:10:49] just a prophet like under the Old
[1:10:51] Testament. Had that been true, God would
[1:10:53] have let him go live in the wilderness.
[1:10:55] &gt;&gt; But in standing in the gap, he forbid
[1:10:56] him to do that. He said, "You're you've
[1:10:58] got a different kind of a ministry." So
[1:11:00] he's a he's like Paul. He's a
[1:11:01] dispensational God bookends the ages
[1:11:03] with dispensational angels.
[1:11:06] &gt;&gt; All right? He did the same thing when he
[1:11:08] closed out the Old Testament. He sent
[1:11:10] John and then Jesus comes on the scene
[1:11:12] and Jesus is the keystone that joins the
[1:11:15] old and new together. John closed it
[1:11:16] out. You follow that?
[1:11:18] &gt;&gt; All right. So, so now I would I would
[1:11:21] like to say that besides uh Luther
[1:11:25] Wesley, the Isuza fathers and brother
[1:11:28] Brandham, I included um Smith
[1:11:30] Wigglesworth because he was lived on the
[1:11:33] outer edge of those early ministries
[1:11:35] from the not only the Welsh revival but
[1:11:37] the Isuza revival. The Welsh revival was
[1:11:39] just across the pond about a year or two
[1:11:42] before the Isuza revival. So, it was
[1:11:43] coming this way. I also chose to include
[1:11:46] Arthur Pink because Brother Brandham,
[1:11:48] he's a reformed minister. Brother
[1:11:50] Brandham uh studied his works and quoted
[1:11:52] from him numerous times. He's one of my
[1:11:54] personal favorites as well. And um and I
[1:11:57] I wanted to look at just to see if we
[1:11:59] could determine how would the enemy best
[1:12:03] what would be his best tactic. And I and
[1:12:06] I have to delve back into their writings
[1:12:08] to see h what how they felt about these
[1:12:12] verses. All right. Right. And I I'm just
[1:12:14] just an overview. If you go back, I have
[1:12:16] all of their writings. It wasn't hard
[1:12:17] for me. I have all of their books and
[1:12:19] their commentaries. I study from them
[1:12:20] all the time. And so, uh, it was a it
[1:12:22] was a quick, uh, pitch and catch for me.
[1:12:25] Um, but you're welcome to go back and
[1:12:27] study it out yourself. But, but when we
[1:12:30] when we when you think about the armor,
[1:12:33] you've got to understand this is a this
[1:12:35] is an important principle. The armor is
[1:12:36] very comprehensive.
[1:12:39] It's not just it's not just something
[1:12:41] light and transient. It's uh because
[1:12:44] because first of all it's comprehensive
[1:12:46] because it guards not only our hearts
[1:12:47] but it guards our mind. It not only
[1:12:49] guards our hearts and our minds but it
[1:12:51] guards our daily lives. See
[1:12:54] &gt;&gt; it guards our actual actions. That make
[1:12:56] sense to you? SO WHEN WE UNDERSTAND it
[1:13:00] then the these verses certainly right
[1:13:03] off the bat UM IF THEY IMPLY ANYTHING AT
[1:13:06] all and this was from a commentator and
[1:13:09] I don't remember which one I don't have
[1:13:10] it noted in in here but he made the
[1:13:12] comment that right off the bat if if if
[1:13:16] Ephesians 6:12 and 13 is saying anything
[1:13:21] to us at all IT IS CERTAINLY IMPLYING
[1:13:24] that we need to be fully
[1:13:28] equipped.
[1:13:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:31] &gt;&gt; At all times.
[1:13:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:35] &gt;&gt; And this is this is what you're about to
[1:13:37] hear. I'm going to read some excerpts
[1:13:39] from these great great ministries of the
[1:13:41] restoration of the brat tree starting
[1:13:43] with Luther. You're going to hear this
[1:13:47] this undergirling this overarching theme
[1:13:51] that they're all in agreement that we
[1:13:54] need to be fully equipped at all times.
[1:13:57] Take unto you the whole armor of God. SO
[1:14:03] ONE OF THE MOST PROMINENT WAYS that they
[1:14:05] point to would be distraction. NOW I'VE
[1:14:08] TALKED I'VE TALKED ABOUT THAT FOR YEARS.
[1:14:10] DISTRACTION or busyiness of life and
[1:14:12] Satan uses that to do YOU SAY YOU SAY OH
[1:14:16] YOU KNOW BROTHER JASON YOU KNOW UH CAN
[1:14:19] IT CAN IT REALLY BE THAT SIMPLE uh it
[1:14:22] can and IT IS AND IN FACT IS IT'S AT THE
[1:14:25] VERY FOUNDATION OF EVERYTHING ELSE
[1:14:27] THAT'S BUILT ON TOP OF IT DON'T GET
[1:14:30] DISTRACTED AWAY FROM YOUR PRAYER LIFE
[1:14:32] AWAY FROM YOUR CHURCH ATTENDANCE AWAY
[1:14:34] FROM READING YOUR BIBLE AWAY FROM
[1:14:36] LISTENING TO tapes
[1:14:38] Amen.
[1:14:40] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:14:41] &gt;&gt; LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING. When I was
[1:14:44] working, EARBUDS AND A DEVICE STAY OR
[1:14:48] THEY WERE WIRED, BUT I WORKED I I MY
[1:14:51] WHOLE LIFE GROWING UP ON A JOB. I
[1:14:54] CONSTANTLY WENT FROM ONE MESSAGE TO
[1:14:56] ANOTHER MESSAGE TO ANOTHER MESSAGE TO
[1:14:57] ANOTHER MESSAGE. AND I AND I AND I
[1:15:00] PROBABLY IN MY LIFETIME LISTEN TO
[1:15:02] SEVERAL TIMES OVER WHAT THE REST OF YOU
[1:15:04] HAVE. YOU SAY, "YEAH, BUT YOU'RE A
[1:15:06] PREACHER AND A PASTOR." WELL, I DIDN'T
[1:15:07] KNOW I WOULD BE WHEN I STARTED DOING
[1:15:09] THAT. I JUST HAD AN INSATIABLE URGE. I
[1:15:11] WANTED TO KNOW ABOUT GOD. I WANTED TO
[1:15:14] KNOW ABOUT HIS WORD. AND I RECOMMEND TO
[1:15:16] YOUNG PEOPLE, OLDER PEOPLE, MARRIED
[1:15:18] PEOPLE, SINGLE PEOPLE, GET IN THOSE
[1:15:20] TAPES, PLAY THEM. WHEN YOU FINISH IT,
[1:15:22] START IT AGAIN. PLAY ANOTHER ONE. STAY
[1:15:24] IN YOUR BIBLE. STAY READING THE STAY
[1:15:26] READING GOD'S WORD AND HEARING GOD'S
[1:15:28] PROPHET.
[1:15:30] SO NATURALLY IT WOULD BE DISTRACTION AND
[1:15:33] BUSYINESS BECAUSE HE can attempt, YOU
[1:15:35] KNOW, TO MAKE US FOCUS ON ON ON OUR
[1:15:37] WORLDLY CONCERNS and and distractions.
[1:15:40] AND I'M NOT SAYING YOU DON'T HAVE THEM.
[1:15:41] THEY'RE LEGIT.
[1:15:43] &gt;&gt; NOT SAYING YOU DON'T HAVE DISTRACTIONS.
[1:15:45] WORLDLY CONCERNS, THAT IS A LEGITIMATE
[1:15:47] CONCERN. WE DO HAVE TO LIVE HERE. I
[1:15:49] CAN'T BE SO HEAVENLY MINDED THAT I'M NO
[1:15:51] EARTHLY GOOD. I'M NOT LIVING IN A
[1:15:53] COMMUNE.
[1:15:54] &gt;&gt; I'M ON THE STREETS WITH YOU. THIS IS
[1:15:56] WAR, AND I DON'T PLAN TO LOSE IT. AMEN.
[1:15:59] &gt;&gt; SEE,
[1:16:01] SO ANOTHER ONE THAT HE WOULD COME WITH,
[1:16:03] AND I I REMEMBER YEARS AGO, I WROTE A A
[1:16:06] SMALL essay on THIS, AND I'M KIND OF
[1:16:08] BORROWED FROM IT, UH NOT IN A great
[1:16:10] degree, BUT IT IT'S ALWAYS STOOD OUT TO
[1:16:12] ME that Satan will use discouragement
[1:16:15] and self-doubt.
[1:16:16] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:16:17] &gt;&gt; I REMEMBER ONE OF THE TIMES, I THINK IT
[1:16:19] WAS EVEN BEFORE I WAS A PREACHER, MAYBE
[1:16:21] I WAS ALREADY PREACHING AT THE TIME, I
[1:16:23] WENT OVER TO MY MOM'S HOUSE AND JUST TO
[1:16:24] SIT AROUND AND visit with the dogs and
[1:16:27] GET A COFFEE. NOT MY MOM WAS tell me she
[1:16:29] had dogs and and they were they were my
[1:16:31] dogs and so I went back so I must have
[1:16:33] been married at the time and so I went
[1:16:35] back to I'm sorry
[1:16:38] sister Jean had dogs that had been my
[1:16:40] dogs and I went to see the dogs and my
[1:16:42] mom and drink coffee. Okay, we got that
[1:16:45] clear. Amen. I don't want to see any
[1:16:48] edited videos. Brother Jason saying went
[1:16:51] to see his mother who was a dog.
[1:16:55] But I remember, you know, I CAUGHT HER
[1:16:57] AT A TIME AND AND I COULD TELL SOMETHING
[1:16:59] WAS weighing in and weighing down on her
[1:17:01] heart and the Lord just LIT MY HEART UP
[1:17:03] AND I JUST STARTED PREACHING a sermon
[1:17:04] about how discouragement is one of the
[1:17:06] devil's greatest tools. It is extremely
[1:17:09] effective.
[1:17:11] You know, if he IF HE CAN'T DISCOURAGE
[1:17:12] YOU WITH TOO MANY BILLS OR THIS FRIEND
[1:17:15] SAID THIS ABOUT YOU OR THIS DISEASE OR
[1:17:17] SICKNESS YOU CAN'T GET RID OF OR THIS
[1:17:19] SPIRITUAL WEAKNESS THAT THE DEVIL KEEPS
[1:17:21] STUMBLING YOU AT AND THE NEXT THING YOU
[1:17:23] KNOW THE SKY IS FALLING. YOU'RE NOT
[1:17:25] WORTHY. YOU'RE YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE THE
[1:17:27] HOLY GHOST AND THE THE NEXT THING YOU
[1:17:29] KNOW YOU'RE JUST YOU WANT TO RUN INTO A
[1:17:31] CORNER. YOU WANT TO QUIT CHURCH. YOU
[1:17:32] WANT TO GET AWAY FROM PEOPLE. THAT'S THE
[1:17:33] WORST THING YOU CAN DO.
[1:17:37] &gt;&gt; DON'T BE DISCOURAGED. YOU'RE THE QUEEN
[1:17:38] OF HEAVEN. DON'T BE DISCOURAGED. CHRIST
[1:17:40] DIED FOR YOU. DON'T BE DISCOURAGED. THE
[1:17:42] SEALS ARE OPEN. DON'T BE DISCOURAGED.
[1:17:44] THE COMING OF THE LORD IS SOON.
[1:17:47] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:17:48] &gt;&gt; SEE?
[1:17:48] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:17:50] &gt;&gt; I have to believe that what he said in
[1:17:53] the word.
[1:17:55] If I if I do stumble, IF I CONFESS MY
[1:17:57] SINS, I SAID THIS TO YOU RECENTLY, MY
[1:18:00] FAITH IS IN THE WORD THAT IF I CONFESS
[1:18:03] MY SINS, HE'S FAITHFUL AND JUST TO
[1:18:05] forgive me and to cleanse me of all
[1:18:07] unrighteousness.
[1:18:10] &gt;&gt; Satan will use temptation
[1:18:12] uh and I don't mean I DON'T MEAN AS
[1:18:14] MUCH, YOU KNOW, temptation of worldly
[1:18:16] women or worldly music or this or that
[1:18:18] or the other, but but and and I'm not
[1:18:21] even TALKING ABOUT THERE'S THERE'S I'M
[1:18:22] only hitting a few. There's temptation
[1:18:24] to riches and wealth and all of that.
[1:18:26] Not even dealing with that today. Here's
[1:18:28] a here's a biggie. Here's an important
[1:18:31] one. Temptation to compromise.
[1:18:35] That means I'm going to stay a believer,
[1:18:37] but I'm just not going to be that
[1:18:38] fervent.
[1:18:41] &gt;&gt; I'm going to I'm still going to be a
[1:18:42] believer and I'm still going to believe
[1:18:43] what God did in our day. And if anybody
[1:18:45] asks me, I'm going to declare. I'm not
[1:18:47] going to I'm not going to uh I'm not
[1:18:49] going to I'm not ashamed of the gospel.
[1:18:51] It is the power of God to salvation. I
[1:18:53] know it. I get it. I'll tell anybody
[1:18:55] what God has done for me. But in my
[1:18:57] daily walkound, living, breathing,
[1:19:00] talking, walking life, I'm going to
[1:19:03] accept compromise on my standards of how
[1:19:06] I serve God and my spirituality. And and
[1:19:10] and the enemy, if he's trying to do
[1:19:12] anything to disarm you of your armor,
[1:19:16] it's get you. When he can do that, then
[1:19:18] he's going to get you to compromise.
[1:19:20] That's right.
[1:19:22] &gt;&gt; The temptation to compromise. This third
[1:19:24] tactic, I would just say this. It's
[1:19:27] almost always the byproduct of of of
[1:19:30] falling or failing in the application of
[1:19:33] the first two, which were falling victim
[1:19:35] to distraction or falling victim to
[1:19:37] discouragement. And then uh from there,
[1:19:40] it's just a slippery slope for him to
[1:19:42] get you to uh be tempted and to
[1:19:44] compromise. But we are encouraged. See,
[1:19:49] I want to encourage you today, and I'm
[1:19:51] going to do it in a weird way. I want to
[1:19:54] encourage you with a something that
[1:19:56] sounds negative. Stop listening to dark
[1:20:00] forces.
[1:20:03] &gt;&gt; Because that's what you're doing.
[1:20:05] &gt;&gt; Say, I I wasn't having a conversation
[1:20:08] with dark forces like you like I saw in
[1:20:10] that picture. When you're being tempted
[1:20:14] and it's working, you're being tempted
[1:20:16] to compromise. You can't stop a bird
[1:20:18] from flying over your head, but you
[1:20:19] don't have to let him build a nest
[1:20:21] there.
[1:20:22] &gt;&gt; When you do not bring every thought
[1:20:25] subject to the word of God and let the
[1:20:26] Holy Ghost kill it, but you would look
[1:20:28] at it and view it and entertain by it,
[1:20:31] I'm here to tell you something. You are
[1:20:32] in direct
[1:20:35] communication with dark dark angels.
[1:20:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:20:40] &gt;&gt; Don't be naive.
[1:20:41] &gt;&gt; Don't think that's a fairy tale. It's
[1:20:43] real.
[1:20:44] &gt;&gt; See,
[1:20:46] &gt;&gt; don't think these dark beings aren't
[1:20:47] real. Brother Brandham saw them. And and
[1:20:50] in fact, as he not only saw them, he
[1:20:52] heard them. And brother Brandham, that's
[1:20:54] why I said to you in in our beginning,
[1:20:56] it says powers of darkness because
[1:20:58] brother Brandham, interestingly, when he
[1:21:00] would see them, they always were dark.
[1:21:02] &gt;&gt; He would say, "See that dark shadow? See
[1:21:03] that dark streak?" He said, "I see a I
[1:21:06] see the man. going to see the woman's
[1:21:07] shadowed. A dark shadow, a dark hood is
[1:21:09] over them. See, these are dark forces.
[1:21:12] Brother Brandham not only saw them, he
[1:21:14] heard them scream to one another. I just
[1:21:16] heard him in a prayer line in demonology
[1:21:18] yesterday, one of those four that he
[1:21:19] preached on it. And he's talking right
[1:21:21] in the middle of talking to a woman. And
[1:21:23] he says, "Just a moment." And there's a
[1:21:25] long pause and you don't know what's
[1:21:26] happening. And all of a sudden, you he
[1:21:28] says, "I hear a demon screaming."
[1:21:31] &gt;&gt; And he says, "Oh, I see what it is." He
[1:21:33] says, "Here it is he said, "You lady,
[1:21:35] you've got this problem." He says,
[1:21:36] "Well, guess what? The woman right here
[1:21:38] also has it. And those demons are
[1:21:39] screaming back now. You're both healed.
[1:21:41] Go home and give God glory." See, so
[1:21:44] these things are real. He saw them. He
[1:21:46] heard them. He was confronted by them.
[1:21:49] And uh and was often uh confronted by
[1:21:52] them. Uh Brother Brandham says, and I
[1:21:55] and I've got a I've got a a
[1:21:58] little bit of a lengthy quote I want to
[1:22:00] read. You still good?
[1:22:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:02] &gt;&gt; I'm coming down. Um, I'm coming down.
[1:22:04] It's all It's all good. Don't worry. Not
[1:22:06] going to hold you long.
[1:22:08] This is an important topic.
[1:22:11] Brother Brandham comes to the absolute
[1:22:14] and he relates a story. He starts out by
[1:22:16] telling about when brother Carlson and
[1:22:19] all them and they and the angel come and
[1:22:21] said, "They've got a trap set for you."
[1:22:23] Remember that one?
[1:22:24] &gt;&gt; And brother B said, "Well, I won't go."
[1:22:25] And the angel said, "No, you go. I'll be
[1:22:27] with you." And so he said, "You go tell
[1:22:29] them they're not going to get that place
[1:22:31] that it's going to." And they said,
[1:22:32] 'Well, Brother Brandon, we've already
[1:22:33] paid a deposit. We've already got it
[1:22:34] reserved. We've already given them
[1:22:36] money. He said, 'I don't care what
[1:22:37] you've done on the day of the event.
[1:22:39] You're not going to get it. I don't know
[1:22:41] why you're just not going to get it.
[1:22:42] What are we going to get? I don't know.
[1:22:43] It's going to be a green room, and
[1:22:45] there's going to be tables this way, and
[1:22:47] Dr. This one will sit here and Dr. So
[1:22:48] and so, and there'll be this one, and
[1:22:50] you'll sit here and I'll be here, and
[1:22:51] then there'll be and and he literally
[1:22:52] describes the whole thing. And and he
[1:22:55] says, "You're not going to get it. We're
[1:22:56] going into this green room, and Dr. Me
[1:22:59] is going to sit down here." And so and
[1:23:00] just exactly they'll be sitting. I don't
[1:23:02] want to try to pull any punches. Just
[1:23:04] introduce me to the audience and let me
[1:23:06] do the rest. I love that. He says, "And
[1:23:09] that morning when he come up there,
[1:23:11] every man sitting just exactly. They
[1:23:12] cancelled the place out. They had to get
[1:23:14] the town and country to get a place and
[1:23:16] there there there's exactly what I
[1:23:18] described. Just exactly there set Dr.
[1:23:20] Meat and all the rest of them just the
[1:23:22] place that that they he had said they
[1:23:23] would be." And I looked over at him and
[1:23:25] brother Tommy Hicks looked at me and he
[1:23:27] said, "Brother Brandham, I feel like
[1:23:29] fainting." And he said, I said, "Don't
[1:23:31] worry." And so, Brother Carlson got up
[1:23:34] and said, "Now, I know a lot of you men
[1:23:36] is going to disagree with Brother
[1:23:37] Brandham and things like that, but said
[1:23:39] there's one thing. He's not afraid to
[1:23:41] stand here." Said, "Now, I'll just turn
[1:23:42] it over to him." And I said, "Now, each
[1:23:44] one of you, now listen to this religious
[1:23:46] demons. This is relig demonology that
[1:23:49] Brother Brandon was facing in this in
[1:23:51] the religious realm.
[1:23:53] And I said, 'n now each one of you, here
[1:23:56] is what you got against me. And I called
[1:23:57] over four or five different things. I
[1:24:00] want some man to take his Bible and come
[1:24:02] here, stand by my side, and disprove it.
[1:24:04] Certainly. And if you can't do it, then
[1:24:06] stay off my back. That's right. Yes,
[1:24:07] sir. Yes, sir. Uh-huh. That's right.
[1:24:10] &gt;&gt; And he said, I haven't even got a high
[1:24:11] school education. And every one of you
[1:24:13] introduced yourself as Dr. this and
[1:24:15] theology and this, that, and the other.
[1:24:17] And he said, I don't have a high school
[1:24:18] education. He said, but I challenge you
[1:24:20] to bring your Bible and disprove even
[1:24:22] one of the things. Amen.
[1:24:23] &gt;&gt; See, friends, this wasn't done in a
[1:24:25] corner. You don't have to hide and be
[1:24:27] ashamed. God proved this around the
[1:24:29] world.
[1:24:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:32] &gt;&gt; And and brother Carlson said, "He he is
[1:24:34] standing." And so and so, Brother
[1:24:36] Brandham said, "That's right." Said,
[1:24:38] "Then get off my back." That's right.
[1:24:39] Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Uhhuh. That's right.
[1:24:42] Brother Brandham says, "He is standing
[1:24:43] there with you." And so what difference
[1:24:45] does it make? So now then he goes on and
[1:24:48] you remember, and I'm not going to tell
[1:24:50] the story. Do you remember about he's
[1:24:52] walking and he sees the great mamba the
[1:24:54] big the big black snake you remember
[1:24:55] that he's jumping at his brother and
[1:24:57] brother Brandham is brother Brandham is
[1:24:58] told you've been getting you've been
[1:25:00] given power to bind him and loose him so
[1:25:02] brother Brandham breaks in now he says
[1:25:04] he said you've been given power to bind
[1:25:06] him said be of good cheer isn't that a
[1:25:08] isn't that amazing THING FRIENDS THE
[1:25:10] ENEMY COMES INTO YOUR HOME AND A PROPHET
[1:25:12] IS SAYING BE OF GOOD cheer
[1:25:14] &gt;&gt; how can I be of good cheer because
[1:25:16] you've BEEN GIVEN POWER TO BIND HIM OH

[1:25:28] UP YOUR HEAD. YOUR REDEMPTION DRAWETH
[1:25:30] NIGH.
[1:25:31] &gt;&gt; YOU'VE GOT POWER TO BIND HIM.
[1:25:34] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:25:36] &gt;&gt; I SPOKE TO HIM AND HIS TAIL WENT UP IN
[1:25:38] THE AIR AND WHIRLED AROUND. AND JUST
[1:25:39] LIKE IN THIS PICTURE, HANDLE CHOKED
[1:25:40] HIMSELF TO DEATH. BLUE SMOKE FLEW OUT OF
[1:25:42] HIM. NOW, now watch him. He comes to
[1:25:44] this story. Now, here's what he's been
[1:25:45] trying to get to. Next morning, when I
[1:25:48] woke up, I was laying there. And I said,
[1:25:50] "I better get up and take the children
[1:25:51] to school." I looked over and there was
[1:25:52] this hideous looking thing. Looked like
[1:25:56] it was Alioop. You remember the old
[1:25:58] comic strip? Alioop.
[1:26:00] He looked like a caveman with big horns.
[1:26:03] I remember seeing that as a child.
[1:26:05] Looked like Alioop in the funny paper.
[1:26:07] Great big horns sticking out of it. He
[1:26:10] was going sounding like a hen cackling
[1:26:12] or singing like they're going from the
[1:26:14] barn. I looked at it. I said, "Mey, ma,
[1:26:17] ma, honey." She didn't wake up. I
[1:26:19] thought, "Yeah, that's scared to death."
[1:26:21] I waited there just a minute and stand
[1:26:23] and watch. People talk about devils and
[1:26:26] don't even know what they are sometime.
[1:26:28] That's right. But you run headlong into
[1:26:30] them every day. Maybe you will. And
[1:26:32] after a while, he was accusing me. Said,
[1:26:35] "You have no power with God. You're just
[1:26:37] a bluff. You have no power." Now,
[1:26:40] Brother Brandham had just the day before
[1:26:42] seen the vision of the man and had been
[1:26:44] told, "You have power to loose and
[1:26:46] bind." And so now here's the enemy.
[1:26:48] Don't think that just because God comes
[1:26:50] and does something special in your life,
[1:26:52] the devil won't come the next day. Even
[1:26:55] if you're a prophet. See,
[1:26:58] imagine how Brother Brandham would have
[1:27:00] withstood this if he hadn't had on all
[1:27:02] the armor.
[1:27:04] And he says
[1:27:07] after a while, he was accusing me. He
[1:27:09] said, "You have no power with God.
[1:27:12] You're just a bluff. You have no power."
[1:27:14] power. See, the the enemy knew that
[1:27:16] wasn't true, but if he could get brother
[1:27:18] Brandham to believe it about himself,
[1:27:21] and I said, "Satan,
[1:27:24] you're an offense to me. Get out of my
[1:27:28] way in the name of Jesus Christ."
[1:27:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:30] &gt;&gt; And he left.
[1:27:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:32] &gt;&gt; And I laid there a little bit in bed,
[1:27:34] started to raise up. I felt a real sweet
[1:27:36] feeling come over me. I thought, "Wonder
[1:27:38] if the Holy Spirit now is close." And
[1:27:41] over in the corner, so help me. Here's
[1:27:43] my Bible over my heart. Brother Bram
[1:27:45] said, right where that demon had been in
[1:27:47] the corner and vanished, he said a light
[1:27:50] dropped down into that same corner. And
[1:27:52] he and he said, "The sweetest voice I
[1:27:54] ever heard in my life said, don't fear
[1:27:56] to go anywhere and don't fear to do
[1:27:58] anything for the never failing presence
[1:28:01] of Jesus Christ is with you wherever you
[1:28:04] go."
[1:28:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:06] &gt;&gt; That settled it with me. Let them rage.
[1:28:08] I got an absolute. My anchor holds
[1:28:10] yonder because it's the word of the
[1:28:12] living God. So they're very real.
[1:28:15] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:28:15] &gt;&gt; THESE DEMON FORCES ARE VERY REAL. AND
[1:28:18] JUST AS YOU KNOW, JU JUST AS THE
[1:28:19] SCRIPTURE uh shows US THAT IT'S POWERS
[1:28:22] OF DARKNESS, THIS IS EXACTLY HOW THEY
[1:28:24] APPEAR TO A PROPHET. Listen friends,
[1:28:26] when you don't I'm I'm I'm I'm in my
[1:28:28] winding up stage and I got a a a short
[1:28:30] YouTube video I want to show you. When
[1:28:33] you WHEN YOU DON'T PUT ON THE WHOLE
[1:28:36] armor of God, um then then THIS IS WHERE
[1:28:40] THEN THIS IS WHERE THE ENEMY BECOMES
[1:28:43] FAR TOO SUCCESSFUL IN OUR LIVES OF
[1:28:48] GETTING US TO COMPROMISE, OF GETTING US
[1:28:50] TO COOL OFF, OF GETTING US TO PRIORITIZE
[1:28:54] OTHER THINGS ABOVE ASSEMBLING YOURSELVES
[1:28:58] TOGETHER. THE MORE so as you see the day
[1:28:59] approaching.
[1:29:01] &gt;&gt; PEOPLE HAVE GOTTEN SO COMPROMISED THEY
[1:29:03] DON'T EVEN CARE ABOUT THAT SCRIPTURE
[1:29:05] ANYMORE. THAT SCRIPTURE MEANS NOTHING TO
[1:29:08] TOO MANY BELIEVERS. IT MIGHT AS WELL NOT
[1:29:11] EVEN BE IN THEIR BIBLE
[1:29:15] BECAUSE THEY PUT JOBS AND CAREERS AND
[1:29:18] BOYFRIENDS AND GIRLFRIENDS AND AND THIS
[1:29:22] EVENT AND THIS EVENT AND THAT EVENT AND
[1:29:24] THIS GATHERING AND THIS SOCIAL THING AND
[1:29:26] THEY CARE NOTHING ABOUT THAT. PAUL SAID
[1:29:29] THE MORE THE DAY GETS EVIL, THE MORE YOU
[1:29:31] NEED TO ASSEMBLE YOURSELVES TOGETHER IN
[1:29:33] THE HOUSE OF GOD. AND THE ONLY TIME YOU
[1:29:36] WILL HEAR, "BROTHER JASON, STOP HARPING
[1:29:38] ON THAT IS ON RESURRECTION MORNING WHEN
[1:29:40] I WON'T EVER HAVE TO SAY IT AGAIN."
[1:29:43] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:29:44] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:29:46] &gt;&gt; THESE EVIL SPIRITS ARE REAL. THESE DARK
[1:29:48] ANGELS, THESE DARK FORCES, WE CANNOT BE
[1:29:52] COMFORTABLE WITH WEARING OUR ARMOR in
[1:29:56] completely.
[1:29:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:58] &gt;&gt; OR INCORRECTLY. ALL RIGHT.
[1:30:00] &gt;&gt; SEE,
[1:30:02] so these WERE THE THINGS THAT THAT THE
[1:30:04] THAT THE FOUNDING UH YOU KNOW, WHEN I
[1:30:06] BEGAN TO RESEARCH THESE THESE B THESE
[1:30:09] RESTORATION UH MINISTRIES, that was one
[1:30:11] of the THINGS THAT LUTHER SPENT SO MUCH
[1:30:13] TIME ON ABOUT ignorance in scripture AND
[1:30:16] AND PEOPLE DON'T READ THEIR BIBLES AND
[1:30:18] AND YOU AND LUTHER WOULD SAY, YOU CAN'T
[1:30:20] WIELD THE SWORD OF THE SPIRIT
[1:30:22] EFFECTIVELY. YOU SEE, SO this was THIS
[1:30:24] WAS LUTHER'S STRONGEST ARGUMENT THAT
[1:30:26] YOU'RE YOU'RE YOU'RE YOU KNOW FEEDING
[1:30:28] UPON THE WORD OF GOD CONTINUALLY. AND SO
[1:30:31] UH YOU KNOW SATAN UM HE HE TRIES UM YOU
[1:30:36] KNOW TO MAKE PEOPLE UNINTERESTED IN THE
[1:30:38] WORD OF GOD. AND AND AND LISTEN FRIENDS,
[1:30:41] THAT'S THAT'S WHAT HE'S DOING HERE AT
[1:30:43] THE END TIME. AND HE AND I WANT TO SAY
[1:30:44] THIS TO YOU TODAY BEFORE I MOVE TO MY MY
[1:30:47] FINAL CLOSING ARGUMENT. HE'S NOT JUST
[1:30:50] TRYING TO STOP INDIVIDUALS. HE'S TRYING
[1:30:53] TO STOP WHOLE FAMILIES. HE'S TRYING TO
[1:30:56] STOP BY EXTENSION WHOLE ASSEMBLIES.
[1:31:00] &gt;&gt; YOU SAY, "WELL, IS THIS ASSEMBLY
[1:31:01] IMPORTANT?" THAT THIS ASSEMBLY I MEAN,
[1:31:04] WHAT IF THIS IS THE WHAT IF THERE'S ONLY
[1:31:06] ONE ASSEMBLY IN THE WHOLE WORLD THAT
[1:31:08] GOES IN THE RAPTURE? I'D LIKE IT TO BE
[1:31:10] THIS ONE.
[1:31:13] IF THERE'S ONLY THE FAMILIES WE HAVE
[1:31:14] HERE, I'M POSITIVE THERE'LL BE MANY
[1:31:16] THOUSANDS MORE. BUT I WANT TO MAKE SURE
[1:31:18] ALL OF THESE FAMILIES ARE ARE READY ON
[1:31:20] resurrection morning. See, AND SO HE'S
[1:31:24] TRYING TO STOP THE WHOLE ASSEMBLY, NOT
[1:31:26] ONLY OF THIS ONE, BUT OF ANY CHURCH, THE
[1:31:28] WARFARE. I I USED TO SAY THIS TO MY
[1:31:31] TEENAGE SONS WHEN THEY WERE GROWING UP.
[1:31:33] THIS IS LARGER THAN YOU. SATAN'S NOT
[1:31:35] JUST TRYING TO WRECK YOU. IF HE CAN
[1:31:37] WRECK YOU, HE WRECKS ME AND YOUR MOTHER.
[1:31:39] HE WRECKS OUR NAME. AND IF HE WRECKS OUR
[1:31:41] NAME, HE WRECKS THE CHURCH. THIS IS
[1:31:43] LARGER THAN YOU. QUIT, YOU KNOW, HAVE
[1:31:45] MORE VISION THAN OVER THE END OF YOUR
[1:31:47] NOSE. LOOK AT THE LARGER PICTURE.
[1:31:49] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:31:50] &gt;&gt; SEE, SO THIS IS WHY WE DON'T LIVE
[1:31:52] SELFISHLY. THIS IS WHY WE'RE ALL IN THIS
[1:31:55] THING TOGETHER.
[1:31:57] &gt;&gt; THIS IS WHY WE LOVE AND FORGIVE ONE
[1:31:59] ANOTHER. THIS IS WHY WE PRAY FOR ONE
[1:32:01] ANOTHER. THIS IS WHY WE DON'T JUDGE ONE
[1:32:03] ANOTHER
[1:32:04] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THAT'S THE STRENGTH OF AN
[1:32:06] ASSEMBLY. SEE, SO YOU KNOW, THIS WAS
[1:32:10] THIS WAS TH THIS IS WHAT SATAN DOES. AND
[1:32:13] HIS FINAL VICTORY IS ALWAYS ABOUT
[1:32:15] division and isolation. And it's a shame
[1:32:18] how many churches he has divided and how
[1:32:20] many people that he has isolated over
[1:32:22] the years. Brother Brandham says it this
[1:32:24] way. I need 10 minutes.
[1:32:27] He says, "And is it I be not afraid?"
[1:32:31] Maybe in this great day of prosperity
[1:32:35] that WE'VE BEEN SO INTERESTED IN
[1:32:37] prosperity till we've here it is again
[1:32:41] left off the main thing. Maybe we've
[1:32:44] gone off on some kind of tantrum without
[1:32:47] him. See I mean LISTEN LISTEN FRIENDS
[1:32:50] WHEN brother Brandham
[1:32:52] WHEN HE SAW THE VISION OF THE PREVIEW OF
[1:32:55] THE BRIDE
[1:32:57] IT WAS ONWARD CHRISTIAN SOLDIERS. YES.
[1:33:02] &gt;&gt; MARCHING AS TO WAR. NOT MARCHING TO
[1:33:04] WALMART.
[1:33:05] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:33:06] &gt;&gt; Not marching to the world.
[1:33:08] &gt;&gt; Marching as to war.
[1:33:10] &gt;&gt; You understand? UH IT'S NOT ABOUT, YOU
[1:33:13] KNOW, BETTER HOUSES AND OR CARS OR MORE
[1:33:16] LANDS OR MORE LIKES. AND BROTHER JASON,
[1:33:19] IS THERE ANYTHING WRONG WITH IMPROVING
[1:33:21] MY LIFE? NOPE.
[1:33:23] &gt;&gt; NOTHING WRONG WITH THAT AT ALL. BUT HAVE
[1:33:25] YOU LEFT OFF THE MAIN THING?
[1:33:27] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:33:29] THIS GREAT DAY OF PROSPERITY.
[1:33:32] Luther in a in a in A IN A SUMMATION
[1:33:35] CAPSULE, LUTHER'S WHOLE plan was about
[1:33:38] being strong IN THE WORD OF GOD. YOU
[1:33:40] ARE, HE SAYS HERE, AND I'M QUOTING HIM,
[1:33:41] YOU'RE REALLY STRONG IN HIS IN HIS 1533
[1:33:44] SERMON ON THE CHRISTIAN armor and
[1:33:46] weapons. He explains the meaning of each
[1:33:48] piece of armor. YOU'RE REALLY STRONG AND
[1:33:50] FIRM and you remained UNCONQUERED WHEN
[1:33:53] YOU'RE CONSTANTLY IN THE WORD OF GOD.
[1:33:55] FOR EXAMPLE, THE THE having our loins
[1:33:58] gird about with TRUTH MEANS LIVING AN
[1:33:59] UPRIGHT LIFE IN ALL SINCERITY FREE from
[1:34:01] hypocrisy. LIKEWISE, PUTTING ON THE
[1:34:03] BREASTPLATE OF RIGHTEOUS MEANS
[1:34:05] MAINTAINING A BLAMELESS RIGHTEOUS LIFE
[1:34:06] SO TO DEAL FAIRLY WITH ALL MEN. SEE,
[1:34:09] WESLEY LIKEWISE EMPHASIZED THE NECESSITY
[1:34:12] OF THE WHOLE ARMOR OF GOD. And even
[1:34:14] notes that the GREEK TERM FOR WHOLE
[1:34:16] ARMOR in Ephesians 6 means a complete
[1:34:19] suit of armor. WE'RE NOT. AND WESLEY
[1:34:21] SAYS WE'RE NOT TO PUT ON ONLY ONE PIECE
[1:34:25] AS IF ARMOR IS SCARCE.
[1:34:29] &gt;&gt; ARMOR IS NOT SCARCE.
[1:34:31] &gt;&gt; YOU'VE GOT THE WHOLE SEVEN THE WHOLE
[1:34:34] SEVEN SEALS OPEN. SEE? SO HE SAYS
[1:34:38] OMISSION OF ANY PART OF THE ARMOR.
[1:34:43] Omission of any part. I want you TO
[1:34:45] REALLY TRY TO FOCUS YOURSELF. YOU SEEM
[1:34:47] QUIET. MAYBE MAYBE YOU'RE NOT USED to me
[1:34:49] going in a little bit of overtime. Maybe
[1:34:51] this sub subject is making you
[1:34:52] uncomfortable. Give me your undivided
[1:34:55] attention. I'm not saying somebody's
[1:34:56] not. I sometimes that's true. That's not
[1:34:58] what I'm meaning now. I just I just
[1:35:01] sense a tiredness of your mind. You
[1:35:03] good?
[1:35:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:04] &gt;&gt; This is important. The devil would like
[1:35:06] nothing better than to send your brain
[1:35:08] somewhere shopping.
[1:35:10] &gt;&gt; All right. He doesn't like this kind of
[1:35:12] preaching. Dark forces are against this
[1:35:14] kind of preaching.
[1:35:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:18] Wesley would go on to say that it must
[1:35:22] be the whole armor for strength and
[1:35:26] stability to our adversaries. In
[1:35:27] Wesley's words, nothing less than the
[1:35:30] full equipment will SUFFICE FOR SUCH A
[1:35:32] BATTLE. HE WOULD SAY THIS, "OMISSION OF
[1:35:35] ANY PART OF THE armor or corresponding
[1:35:39] spiritual duty." Pink
[1:35:42] um cabbage is down on duty as well. It
[1:35:45] leaves a believer vulnerable. ARE YOU
[1:35:48] WILLING TO ACCEPT THE ADVICE OF YOUR
[1:35:51] SIXTH CHURCH AGE MESSENGER?
[1:35:54] &gt;&gt; HE SAID IT'LL LEAVE YOU VULNERABLE IF
[1:35:56] YOU DON'T HAVE ON ALL THE ARMOR. THE
[1:35:59] ISUZA STREET FATHERS CARRIED ON WITH THE
[1:36:02] WHOLE THE WHOLE SPIRITUAL ARMOR. FROM
[1:36:04] THE APOSTOLIC FAITH PAPERS, you can read
[1:36:07] where THEY'RE CONSTANTLY EXHORTING THAT
[1:36:09] IN THESE LAST DAYS WHEN THE POWER OF
[1:36:11] HELL AND THE CLOUDS OF DARKNESS ARE
[1:36:14] GATHERING OVER THIS OLD WORLD. LISTEN,
[1:36:17] God will hold CHRISTIANS ACCOUNTABLE FOR
[1:36:20] THE SOULS OF MEN. BROTHER BRANDHAM
[1:36:22] TAUGHT THAT. SEE, THEREFORE, WE MUST
[1:36:26] HAVE ON THE WHOLE ARMOR OF GOD. ARTHUR
[1:36:29] PINK STRESSED THAT GOD HAD PROVIDED
[1:36:31] AMPLE ARMOR, but each believer IS
[1:36:36] RESPONSIBLE TO TAKE IT up
[1:36:39] &gt;&gt; and use it.
[1:36:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:41] &gt;&gt; PINK WROTE THAT THE CHRISTIAN LIFE IS A
[1:36:44] FIERCE BATTLE requiring complete
[1:36:47] DEPENDENCE ON GOD'S STRENGTH. OUR SECOND
[1:36:51] GREATEST need is TO BE WELLARMED FOR THE
[1:36:54] CONFLICT WE FACE DAILY. HE CONCLUDES BY
[1:36:57] SAYING, "IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO STAND
[1:37:00] AGAINST THE WOWS OF THE DEVIL UNLESS WE
[1:37:03] AVAIL OURSELVES OF THE FULL PROVISION
[1:37:06] GOD HAS MADE FOR OUR DEFENSE. THE ARMOR
[1:37:09] IS A GIFT, BUT THE DUTY IS OURS.
[1:37:13] &gt;&gt; WE HAVE TO ACTIVELY PUT IT ON." SEE, AND
[1:37:17] SO HE HE GOES ON TO SAY, "GOD DOESN'T
[1:37:19] DOES NOT UH FIT IT ON US. HE PLACES IT
[1:37:22] BEFORE US. AND IT IS OUR RESPONSIBILITY
[1:37:25] TO PUT ON THE WHOLE ARMOR OF GOD.
[1:37:27] WIGGLESWORTH, RIGHT BEFORE I COME TO
[1:37:29] BROTHER BRANDHAM, WIGGLESWORTH, I LOVE
[1:37:30] my goodness, what a this is this is a
[1:37:32] man who who had probably the most
[1:37:36] supernatural ministry maybe that next to
[1:37:40] William Brandham I've ever read. And
[1:37:42] I've read his whole life and his
[1:37:43] memoirs. I have all of his books and all
[1:37:44] of his writings and all of his
[1:37:46] testimonies. This man, this man is the
[1:37:48] same man who one time stood a dead man
[1:37:51] up in his corner and commanded him to
[1:37:53] come back to life in the name of Jesus
[1:37:54] Christ. And the man did.
[1:37:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:56] &gt;&gt; And he'd already been dead for hours.
[1:37:58] And even his wife said, "Honey, you've
[1:38:00] went over. You you've went too far this
[1:38:02] time." She tried to discourage him. And
[1:38:04] he put her out of the room and said, "I
[1:38:05] said, I command you in the name of Jesus
[1:38:07] Christ." He didn't, you know, sometimes
[1:38:10] they had to get on him because sometimes
[1:38:12] he'd punch people. they'd come up with a
[1:38:14] a cancer in their stomach and he'd haul
[1:38:16] off and double them over and the cancer
[1:38:17] be gone. So, I don't know if I want to
[1:38:20] do that, but that was where his faith
[1:38:22] was. You know, he he come up out of that
[1:38:24] Welsh revival and and out of the Isuza
[1:38:26] Street revival. He had a lot to say to
[1:38:28] the Pentecostal movement. AND UM SO THEN
[1:38:31] WE COME TO BROTHER BRANDHAM finally
[1:38:34] and brother Brham takes AN INTERESTING
[1:38:39] BECAUSE EVERYTHING THAT I READ WHETHER
[1:38:41] IT WAS Luther or or Wesley OR THE ISUZA
[1:38:44] FATHERS or Pink or Wigglesworth, BROTHER
[1:38:47] BRANDHAM SAID AND TAUGHT all of those
[1:38:49] things all through the quotes. I'm I
[1:38:51] could put 20 quotes today just
[1:38:52] augmenting their points. But I want to
[1:38:55] take the last point today IS THAT
[1:38:59] BROTHER BRANDHAM ACTUALLY TAKES ALL OF
[1:39:01] THEIR POINTS IN ONE SUMMATION, ONE
[1:39:04] ENORMOUS POINT AND JUST GOES ALL THE WAY
[1:39:06] TO THE WALL WITH IT. And he he teaches
[1:39:10] THAT THE FULL ARMOR OF GOD I IT'S NOT TO
[1:39:14] BE THOUGHT OF AS JUST I GOT TO PUT THIS
[1:39:16] PART, I GOT TO PUT THAT PART, I GOT TO
[1:39:17] GET THIS PART, I GOT TO GET THAT PART.
[1:39:19] THE FULL ARMOR OF GOD IS NOTHING LESS
[1:39:22] THAN GOD'S own presence and spirit
[1:39:26] living within the believer.
[1:39:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:29] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham taught us THAT ON THE
[1:39:32] DAY OF PENTECOST, WHAT CAME DOWN WAS THE
[1:39:35] WHOLE ARMOR OF GOD.
[1:39:37] &gt;&gt; THIS IS WHY BROTHER BRANDHAM WOULD SAY
[1:39:39] THE TOKEN HAS TO BE ON DISPLAY. THAT'S
[1:39:44] THE ONLY THING THE DEVIL WILL RECOGNIZE.
[1:39:46] HE'LL RECOGNIZE THAT BLOODY SACRIFICE OF
[1:39:49] THE BLEEDING WORD THAT YOU HAVE NOT ONLY
[1:39:52] RECEIVED AND BELIEVED, BUT YOU HAVE
[1:39:54] ACTED UPON IT AND YOU HAVE HAD YOUR
[1:39:56] WHOLE LIFE CONVERTED AND YOU ARE NOW THE
[1:39:59] BLOOD OF GOD BY THE SPIRIT. AND THAT IS
[1:40:01] THE POWER THAT'S WITHIN THE BRIDE.
[1:40:03] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:40:05] THAT IT IS NOTHING LESS THAN THE TOKEN
[1:40:07] LIFE, SATAN'S most effective strategy,
[1:40:11] than is to do anything he can to lure
[1:40:15] you away on a daily basis, to lure you
[1:40:19] away from those things operating in your
[1:40:22] life that add daily strength and grit to
[1:40:26] your testimony. Now, if he can pull that
[1:40:28] off, if he can pull it off, then he can
[1:40:33] divide husbands and wives.
[1:40:37] &gt;&gt; He can divide parents from children.
[1:40:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:41] &gt;&gt; He can divide congregations from their
[1:40:44] pastor. He can divide congregants from
[1:40:48] each other. Amen.
[1:40:49] &gt;&gt; And if he can divide homes and families
[1:40:53] and churches, then it does not matter
[1:40:57] how religious you are or how right you
[1:40:59] are in your doctrine.
[1:41:01] &gt;&gt; He will have absolute rulership over
[1:41:04] your lives, this church, over everything
[1:41:08] that you love. Satan will take away from
[1:41:12] you everything that you love.
[1:41:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:15] &gt;&gt; You hear me, young people? That's we're
[1:41:17] a we're an army. We're supposed to be
[1:41:20] marching in sync. I've got a
[1:41:23] demonstration by Mark Robber at one of
[1:41:25] one of the engineering sites that that
[1:41:28] I've watched for years and really like
[1:41:30] his stuff.
[1:41:33] And he did uh uh I forget the the the
[1:41:37] it's all it's all pure science. And he
[1:41:39] did a demonstration using metronomes.
[1:41:42] Let's pull that up. Sarah, don't start
[1:41:43] it till I tell you. Just have that have
[1:41:45] that up and running. We have it ready.
[1:41:47] Amen. Praise the Lord.
[1:41:50] Uh, let's see. Brother Matt, where are
[1:41:52] you? Um,
[1:41:54] okay. Now, hold it, Sarah. Stop right
[1:41:57] there, sister. All right. Now, that's
[1:42:00] perfect. What you're going to notice is
[1:42:02] there are two metronomes
[1:42:04] on this board. You'll notice there's
[1:42:07] Mark Robber. You'll notice that the
[1:42:10] board is held aloft by what looks like
[1:42:12] two aluminum cans. Now, this is
[1:42:15] important because this is pure this is
[1:42:17] pure physics
[1:42:19] that these metronomes are going to be
[1:42:21] out of sync.
[1:42:23] But because that they're resting on a
[1:42:27] and let me just put it in this language,
[1:42:29] a living platform that that moves that
[1:42:33] actually the movement of the metronomes
[1:42:36] moves the floor on the rollers and
[1:42:38] magically almost that rocking motion
[1:42:42] starts feeding energy back into the
[1:42:44] metronomes and they start feeding each
[1:42:46] other and the whole thing becomes a
[1:42:48] dynamic of Mr. and Mrs. Jesus Christ
[1:42:51] working in perfect harmony. And you're
[1:42:54] going to don't be don't be worried.
[1:42:56] Don't be worried. No matter how bad they
[1:42:59] look out of sync, they're going to come
[1:43:02] in sync perfectly.
[1:43:05] Moreover,
[1:43:06] you're going to be tempted to go, "Oh,
[1:43:08] that's close enough. That's Yeah,
[1:43:10] they're pretty much in sync." No, no,
[1:43:11] no. Just hold on. They come into perfect
[1:43:16] sync.
[1:43:18] This is now see when you're when you're
[1:43:20] resting on a rigid
[1:43:23] denominational f I mean board like that
[1:43:26] when you're resting on a man-made rigid
[1:43:29] BOARD OF DOCTRINE OR WHEN YOUR LIFE IS
[1:43:32] JUST A rigid board of doctrine
[1:43:35] &gt;&gt; your your home won't have harmony your
[1:43:37] church won't have harmony parents to
[1:43:39] children won't have harmony you've got
[1:43:42] to have the living word as your
[1:43:45] foundation it's not about and I don't
[1:43:48] MEAN LIVING WORD AS IN EACH AGE GOD all
[1:43:50] lots more of his word. I'M TALKING ABOUT
[1:43:52] friends the interaction of you and
[1:43:56] Christ.
[1:43:57] &gt;&gt; WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE CHURCH AND JESUS
[1:44:00] INTERACTING TOGETHER LIVING IN THE EARTH
[1:44:03] IN 2025.
[1:44:05] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:44:07] &gt;&gt; Let me ask YOU A QUESTION BEFORE WE
[1:44:08] BEFORE WE HIT PLAY.
[1:44:12] We're at the end of 2025
[1:44:15] to my shock and dismay
[1:44:21] &gt;&gt; and I've had to look back and go,
[1:44:24] am I coming to the end and I've got a
[1:44:27] communion and footwashing in a few days.
[1:44:30] Am I coming to the end of this year? Am
[1:44:32] I satisfied that I've that I've used
[1:44:35] this year productively and that I'm
[1:44:37] coming to the end of this year and I'm
[1:44:39] stronger and more faithful to the Lord
[1:44:43] and more on fire than I was at the end
[1:44:45] of 2024? Or might have I just wasted
[1:44:50] away and this year just went like that
[1:44:53] and blew past me and I'm finding that I
[1:44:55] don't even have the spiritual height
[1:44:58] that I had a year ago. I just want to
[1:45:00] say this to you. I don't want to leave
[1:45:01] you with that. I'm not saying that to
[1:45:04] discourage you. I'm going to show you
[1:45:06] the remedy. And that remedy is get into
[1:45:09] harmony with the Holy Ghost. Get into
[1:45:12] harmony with the word of God. Or
[1:45:15] you, I promise you, you'll burn through
[1:45:18] 2026 just as fast and you will have made
[1:45:22] no progress. And this time next year,
[1:45:25] you'll still be wondering, "Why is the
[1:45:27] power of God not operating in my life
[1:45:30] and in my home?"
[1:45:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:34] &gt;&gt; Here's your remedy. Now watch. Go ahead,
[1:45:36] sir.
[1:45:42] Look at the cans moving under it.
[1:45:47] Perfect.
[1:45:49] Let's add them. Let's Let's quadruple
[1:45:51] them.
[1:45:52] Let's get a bigger church.
[1:45:54] [Applause]
[1:45:55] Oh, everybody's out of order. No
[1:45:58] harmony.
[1:45:59] What do we do? Just wait.
[1:46:05] Keep waiting.
[1:46:09] We need a bigger church.
[1:46:12] Let's get so many diverse people from
[1:46:14] different cultures, different beliefs,
[1:46:16] different backgrounds. There's no chance
[1:46:19] we can get this church in harmony.
[1:46:24] You can't
[1:46:26] you can't even get yourself there.
[1:46:30] What?
[1:46:35] When you live on the living word,
[1:46:39] your whole life comes into sync.
[1:46:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. That is what being a real warrior
[1:46:49] in spiritual warfare can do for you. I
[1:46:53] don't know what kind of stand with me. I
[1:46:55] don't know right here. This is my last
[1:46:58] Sunday service
[1:47:00] in 2025.
[1:47:03] If the Lord wills, I'll preach the first
[1:47:05] one Sunday in 2026.
[1:47:08] If the Lord wills, we'll all be in the
[1:47:11] rapture before then. If the Lord wills,
[1:47:14] we'll all be back here for a service.
[1:47:17] And I can tell you this much. I'm going
[1:47:19] to be continuing in this series to show
[1:47:22] you how important it is to have your
[1:47:25] life in harmony with the word of God.
[1:47:29] And God has a word for you to be in
[1:47:31] harmony with. You're not left to figure
[1:47:35] out how to defeat these dark angels and
[1:47:38] get them out of your home, get them out
[1:47:39] of your life, get them out of your kids.
[1:47:41] I'm here to tell you something, friends.
[1:47:43] He is more than able today. Do you
[1:47:46] believe that?
[1:47:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's bow our heads.
[1:47:51] Whatever you choose, Sister Deb.
[1:47:55] Father, we thank you for this word
[1:47:57] today. And as I
[1:48:01] come here, Lord, to this last Sunday
[1:48:03] sermon in this year, we see it slipping
[1:48:06] away very quickly. We're going to gather
[1:48:08] just in a few days, Lord, and have the
[1:48:11] Lord's supper and the foot washing and
[1:48:12] it'll be the last service that we have
[1:48:14] in this year. How many more years that
[1:48:16] we have? Who can say? We don't know.
[1:48:18] Brother Brandham taught us that you'll
[1:48:20] never let us know. You'll that's a flat
[1:48:23] statement. You'll never He'll never let
[1:48:25] us know. All we know is that we're
[1:48:28] close.
[1:48:29] And we see the world slipping further
[1:48:31] and further into madness and chaos.
[1:48:34] We see that 30 33,000
[1:48:39] different denominations, they can never
[1:48:41] get all of those metronomes in harmony
[1:48:43] because they're on a stiff foundation.
[1:48:46] There's no unseen force at work. But for
[1:48:50] us, Lord, we rest upon the living word.
[1:48:53] The movement of the Holy Spirit in our
[1:48:55] lives is what synchronizes us. the
[1:48:58] movement of the Holy Spirit under that
[1:49:01] foundation
[1:49:03] that we are standing upon today,
[1:49:06] that living foundation of God's word
[1:49:09] that desires, Lord, you you you you
[1:49:14] showed us in the scripture how that this
[1:49:17] great mystery that had been hidden since
[1:49:20] the ages, now it wants fellowship.
[1:49:25] the desire of this great mystery so that
[1:49:27] we we deduce then that the great mystery
[1:49:30] is not doctrine. The great mystery is
[1:49:32] not programmed. The great mystery wants
[1:49:34] fellowship.
[1:49:36] This great revealed mystery is a person
[1:49:38] of Christ in his word and he desires to
[1:49:42] have this kind of fellowship in our
[1:49:43] lives. I pray that you'll help us today
[1:49:46] Lord. We come down to the end. We saw a
[1:49:48] a little example, Father, from a a
[1:49:51] worldly engineer, a fine man as far as I
[1:49:53] know, but it's just an example, Lord, of
[1:49:56] what is possible when there's a living
[1:49:59] foundation under the chaos. It brings it
[1:50:03] back into harmony. I pray today
[1:50:06] for anyone here today, Lord, under the
[1:50:08] sound of my voice. And we're going to
[1:50:10] let the people go, but just before we
[1:50:12] do, Lord, would you look down into our
[1:50:15] hearts today? I'm sure that this word
[1:50:17] has penetrated them as it penetrated me.
[1:50:20] I feel perfectly satisfied. I'm grateful
[1:50:23] to you, Lord, because as I stand here
[1:50:26] right now, I feel a perfect sense of
[1:50:29] satisfaction in my soul that what was
[1:50:32] needed to be said today was said
[1:50:35] effectively and I said it all. Now,
[1:50:38] there's more to say, but it wasn't for
[1:50:39] today. And I knew that and I'm grateful.
[1:50:42] Now, I pray you'll deal with hearts. Let
[1:50:43] the Holy Spirit who brought the word now
[1:50:46] deal with hearts cuz it's going to take
[1:50:47] you Lord to make it a reality to each
[1:50:50] individual person. I don't know where
[1:50:54] each individual person sees themselves
[1:50:56] on the spectrum uh Lord of how their
[1:50:59] relationship to God is but I know that
[1:51:02] as believers Lord we want to be right.
[1:51:04] We want to be right. I want to be in
[1:51:07] right standing Lord. I want to be in
[1:51:12] right standing. I want to be in harmony.
[1:51:14] I want to be in sync. I I want to I WANT
[1:51:17] TO BE UNIFIED. I WANT THAT MIND which
[1:51:20] was in Christ to operate through me. I
[1:51:23] pray you will grant it today. Lord, we
[1:51:26] commit it to you now. Deal with hearts
[1:51:27] as we worship just a little bit in Jesus
[1:51:30] name. Amen. Let's sing it, my brother.
[1:51:34] When I come to die.
[1:51:39] [Music]
[1:51:40] Oh, when I come
[1:51:44] to die.
