[9:13] &gt;&gt; [music]
[10:01] &gt;&gt; And what a blessed
[10:04] thought it is. What a blessed hope it
[10:07] is. What an assurance it is.
[10:10] &gt;&gt; And this dark hour at the end of world's
[10:12] history to know the creator is sailing
[10:15] like Solomain with us.
[10:17] &gt;&gt; Safely tucked in.
[10:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. arms, whatever may come, let
[10:21] them ride, burst, blow, whatever they
[10:23] want to. It makes no difference to me.
[10:25] &gt;&gt; I'm sailing with the creator.
[10:28] &gt;&gt; What a security
[10:30] &gt;&gt; while sailing these waters.
[10:32] &gt;&gt; Now, while speaking, talking of him
[10:36] about what great things he' done at the
[10:38] revival, feasting, Jesus was probably
[10:40] resting like he is. I said between the
[10:42] revival
[10:44] and we they had been so clearly
[10:46] identified to who he was. The people
[10:49] knew who he was of those who was
[10:52] blinded. But those who had a hold on the
[10:54] scripture because they know that the
[10:58] scripture,
[11:00] God's word has been given a lot to each
[11:03] generation. And that promise of that age
[11:07] has to be fulfilled. And he fulfilled
[11:10] exactly what was supposed to be done in
[11:12] the time of the Messiah. He met every
[11:15] qualification
[11:18] that we he was assured that he was the
[11:22] man.
[11:23] &gt;&gt; But you see, he was so common. He didn't
[11:26] dress like a priest.
[11:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[11:29] &gt;&gt; He had no not an education as as what
[11:32] we'd call education. We had no record of
[11:35] him even going to school.
[11:38] But there was something about him that
[11:41] was different. And then he invited them
[11:44] when they couldn't understand said the
[11:46] scriptures for in them you think you
[11:49] have eternal life and that's the thing
[11:52] that testifies of me
[11:54] &gt;&gt; they tell you who I am
[11:56] &gt;&gt; and I remember that all had this in
[11:59] their heart and was thinking of these
[12:01] things and while sailing around on the
[12:04] sea how they could be like children as
[12:06] long as he was in the ship with them.
[12:10] our friend, what that ought to do to us.
[12:13] The same identified Jesus Christ, the
[12:18] same creator, the same God is with us
[12:22] tonight.
[12:23] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[12:24] &gt;&gt; What a secure it is. What a feeling to
[12:28] know that his presence is here.
[12:30] &gt;&gt; Now,
[12:31] &gt;&gt; we find right when this having this
[12:33] great time, all of a sudden, trouble
[12:37] arose.
[12:38] The ship rock, the sails blew off, the
[12:41] water filled the boat, all hopes of
[12:44] survival was gone.
[12:47] Now, isn't it strange? Just like it is
[12:49] now as we're coming down to the end now.
[12:53] Isn't it strange? We can talk about how
[12:56] great he is. We can tell how great he is
[12:58] in our church when we testify. We tell
[13:01] the our our employees employers how
[13:04] great he is. We tell the people on the
[13:06] street how great he is. And when trouble
[13:08] strikes, we are frustrated.
[13:12] &gt;&gt; We just
[13:14] &gt;&gt; the things that we've seen him do, the
[13:16] things that we know he does. And just
[13:18] let a little sickness or a little
[13:19] trouble strike the home. Watch what
[13:21] happens.
[13:21] &gt;&gt; All gone to pieces. All all hopes are
[13:24] gone. Though they had seen him do so
[13:25] many things, all forgotten when trouble
[13:28] strikes.
[13:30] Like now we have seen this great
[13:32] revival. We have history of other great
[13:35] revivals. We have his presence. We know
[13:38] these things and sometimes trouble sets
[13:42] in that we can't remedy.
[13:45] They u
[13:47] for instance like now we have trouble in
[13:49] our churches now. We have denominational
[13:52] troubles, arguments in our churches. We
[13:54] don't know what's going to take place.
[13:57] We see a great thing forming up there.
[13:59] All of us believers in the Bible see
[14:01] something's fixing to take place.
[14:03] There's nobody but what knows that. And
[14:05] all the churches are going to be brought
[14:07] into that ecumenical council of
[14:09] churches.
[14:10] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[14:10] &gt;&gt; And when you do that, you're going to
[14:11] forfeit your great evangelical teaching
[14:13] of the Bible.
[14:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[14:15] &gt;&gt; And the Pentecostals are sympathizing
[14:16] with it, going right into it like a hog
[14:18] going to its slaughter.
[14:20] &gt;&gt; Right. Echumenical council. Many great
[14:23] Pentecostal leaders agreeing with them.
[14:26] &gt;&gt; I'm telling you, don't you never stick
[14:28] your neck in a thing like that.
[14:30] &gt;&gt; That's exactly what the Bible said would
[14:31] come to pass. There's the beast in the
[14:33] market perfectly. Everything's set right
[14:35] in order. And we see this and we wonder
[14:38] what's going to be the outcome of it.
[14:40] Trouble set in.
[14:44] And they forgot
[14:46] that the very one that they were talking
[14:48] about, the very creator was in the boat
[14:50] with them. Now you say, "If I could
[14:52] think that, well, remember we still have
[14:55] him because he's the word always."
[14:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[14:58] &gt;&gt; In John 1:1, as we spoke last night, he
[15:00] was the word and the word was made flesh
[15:03] and dwelt among us. And we still have
[15:05] his word that directs us to his thoughts
[15:08] and his doings for this day.
[15:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[15:11] &gt;&gt; See the not the thoughts Moses had in
[15:14] his day, not the thoughts of disciples,
[15:16] not the thoughts of Luther or Wesley or
[15:18] the Pentecostal age or any of those. We
[15:21] have the Bible here that tells us of
[15:23] what's going to happen now.
[15:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[15:25] &gt;&gt; See, we see the Pentecostal revival in
[15:29] the Bible, the Lutheran and all those
[15:30] church ages. We saw them. But we also
[15:33] have the scripture here telling us what
[15:35] it's going to be now. And that's God.
[15:39] God interpreting his own word for this
[15:44] age that we're living in.
[15:45] &gt;&gt; He's his own interpreter.
[15:48] &gt;&gt; And yet we get frustrated. Don't be
[15:51] frustrated. His disciples sometimes get
[15:54] physical troubles that they can't remedy
[15:56] such as sickness, cancer, so forth that
[15:59] the doctors can't don't know what to do
[16:01] about it. We like them forget who's in
[16:03] the ship.
[16:04] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[16:05] &gt;&gt; They should have known that he knowed
[16:07] all these things. He knew they were
[16:09] going to happen.
[16:10] &gt;&gt; He was a He knew all things. So, he knew
[16:13] this was going to happen in order to
[16:14] happen to him. Why was it let it happen?
[16:16] When he got in that ship, he knew that
[16:19] was going to happen.
[16:21] &gt;&gt; He knows that we had to meet this
[16:23] condition and he's foretold us in the
[16:25] Bible to be that way.
[16:27] &gt;&gt; Now, what was he doing? Testing their
[16:30] faith.
[16:32] Why would he let a a a a fine little
[16:34] motherl looking woman sit in a
[16:36] wheelchair like that? Why would he let a
[16:38] fine young fell here? These young man
[16:40] sitting here in these wheelchairs and
[16:42] ladies and so forth. Why would he? And
[16:44] still they might this live an
[16:46] ordinary life, but there may be some
[16:48] sitting here with heart trouble. If God
[16:50] don't heal, you may be dead before
[16:52] morning.
[16:53] That's
[16:54] &gt;&gt; right. He know it was going to happen.
[16:56] Maybe it's done to give our faith a
[16:58] test. That's what it was done for them.
[17:00] He said so. See, same now. He had proven
[17:04] who he was by the words and signs that
[17:07] he had proved among them that he was the
[17:09] vindicated anointed Messiah that was to
[17:12] come. And he's proved among us by the
[17:14] baptism of the Holy Ghost and the return
[17:16] of the things that he promised in this
[17:18] day that he would do. He's proved that
[17:21] he's here. He proves that he's the same
[17:23] yesterday, today, and forever.
[17:26] &gt;&gt; Then see how easy we can get frustrated
[17:28] in any little thing. We should never let
[17:29] it happen.
[17:30] &gt;&gt; No. He said, "If I do not the works
[17:33] that's written in me, then don't believe
[17:34] me." And if the church, if the Holy
[17:36] Spirit today isn't doing the things that
[17:38] it was supposed to do for this hour,
[17:40] then don't believe the message.
[17:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[17:42] &gt;&gt; Got a right to disbelieve it. But he
[17:44] promised that these things that he's
[17:46] doing right now will be taking place
[17:48] right at this time.
[17:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[17:50] &gt;&gt; So, it ought to make us feel so secured.
[17:53] So going up to the meeting, the great
[17:55] Holy Spirit, I understand, is up there
[17:58] revealing the secrets of the hearts of
[17:59] the people. That's exactly what he said
[18:01] he would do.
[18:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[18:02] &gt;&gt; When he'd be revealed in the last days,
[18:04] Jesus Christ said himself that that's
[18:05] exactly what he would do.
[18:08] &gt;&gt; And he said the world would be in a
[18:10] condition like it was in the days of
[18:11] Sodom. That's just where it's at now. He
[18:14] said the churches would be separated
[18:16] just like they was then. Lot the
[18:17] lukewarm
[18:19] down in Babylon or down in Sodom and the
[18:22] Sodomites. He said Abraham the elected
[18:25] called out group and he sent a messenger
[18:27] to the elected group and he sent two
[18:29] messengers down to them representing
[18:32] each one. That's just what he's done
[18:36] &gt;&gt; even to every name, every action, every
[18:38] move, everything just perfectly, every
[18:40] sign, every manifestation
[18:43] just exactly the same.
[18:44] &gt;&gt; He said it would happen. Now what are we
[18:47] scared about? What's these things on us
[18:50] for? He's trying to see what we'll do
[18:52] about it.
[18:54] &gt;&gt; Notice,
[18:56] &gt;&gt; he told him, said, "Now, if you can't
[18:58] believe me, believe the works that I do.
[18:59] They testify who I am."
[19:02] &gt;&gt; They should have known it, but they
[19:04] didn't. That he was God who created the
[19:08] creator of the winds and the sea. If he
[19:11] could create the winds and the sea,
[19:13] could he not more make them obey his
[19:15] word? Amen.
[19:17] &gt;&gt; If he created everything, can't he make
[19:20] everything obey?
[19:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[19:22] &gt;&gt; Let us remember also he created our
[19:24] bodies.
[19:26] They also will have to obey his word.
[19:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[19:30] &gt;&gt; What do you say? If I could just be sure
[19:32] of that. Well, we are sure of it. He's
[19:36] sure to prove it. So,
[19:37] &gt;&gt; yes,
[19:39] &gt;&gt; they have to obey it. Remember, he's got
[19:42] when we are laying nothing but maybe a
[19:44] spoonful of ashes, he promised to raise
[19:46] up that ashes. He promised to raise it
[19:49] up. The body has to obey him.
[19:51] &gt;&gt; And that's when we die, we rest assure
[19:53] that we'll be raised up because he
[19:55] promised he'd do it. And his promise is
[19:57] his word.
[19:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[19:59] &gt;&gt; And we believe, you believe in a
[20:00] resurrection of the body.
[20:02] &gt;&gt; Sure. If you're not, you're not a
[20:03] Christian.
[20:04] &gt;&gt; So, we believe that he'll raise us up at
[20:06] the last days. He promised to do it. And
[20:08] what is that? That's his word. That's
[20:10] where we stake everything that we got
[20:11] right on that word. And then when it
[20:13] comes to the time that we see the word
[20:16] being identified to be with us, then
[20:19] we're like the disciples in another case
[20:21] when there's out on the sea and and
[20:23] there's about to sink again at another
[20:25] occasion and they seen Jesus come
[20:27] walking on the water
[20:30] and they got scared. They said, "It's
[20:32] it's a spook. It's scary. A afraid it
[20:36] was a spirit." And they cried out with
[20:39] fear.
[20:39] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory.
[20:41] &gt;&gt; The only thing that could help them,
[20:42] they was scared of it.
[20:44] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[20:44] &gt;&gt; And so is it today.
[20:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[20:46] &gt;&gt; The very only thing that can help
[20:49] people, they're afraid of it.
[20:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[20:51] &gt;&gt; Oh, Lord.
[20:52] &gt;&gt; He said, "Fear not, it's I."
[20:56] &gt;&gt; He speaks. How would you know it's him?
[20:58] He's identified by his word. That's what
[20:59] he's identified the first time. That's
[21:01] the way he's identified every time, by
[21:03] his word. Notice
[21:05] after these defi disciples found
[21:07] themselves at the end, it must have
[21:10] dawned on some of them that the creator
[21:12] was still with them. I hope it does that
[21:14] to us tonight where Hebrews 13:8 says
[21:17] he's the same. Then what did they do?
[21:19] They awakened Jesus. Go wake Jesus. Wake
[21:23] him. Call him on the scene. He's very
[21:26] easy called. They had seen uh seen so
[21:29] many things that God had done and and
[21:31] and the words of vindicating him. So
[21:33] have we. And he was not hard to be
[21:36] called into action. They woke him up and
[21:40] said, "Do you care not that we perish?"
[21:43] You say, "How can we be sure of this?
[21:46] Can we prove it?" John 14:12, Jesus
[21:50] said, "He that believeth on me, the
[21:52] works that I do shall he do also."
[21:55] That's exactly our faith bringing Christ
[21:57] in our presence.
[22:00] &gt;&gt; He said in in Luke 17th chapter in the
[22:03] last days when the son of man is being
[22:05] revealed to be a time like Sodom and
[22:07] Gomorrah. We see that happening. He said
[22:10] before that time taking place and
[22:12] Malachi 4 that there'd be a message go
[22:15] forth that would restore the people back
[22:17] to the original faith that was once
[22:19] delivered to the people.
[22:21] &gt;&gt; Yes. always God's program to do that.
[22:24] And then the wicked would be ashes and
[22:26] the righteous would walk out upon their
[22:28] feet. We see all these promise. He's
[22:31] waiting right now for you. You, you,
[22:34] every one of you to call him on the
[22:36] scene.
[22:37] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[22:39] &gt;&gt; Call him on the scene. That's where he
[22:41] wants to be.
[22:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[22:43] &gt;&gt; Called on the scene of action.
[22:46] &gt;&gt; Notice
[22:48] when you call him on the scene. So then
[22:50] we say let us wake him then call him to
[22:53] confirm his word and the thing that he
[22:55] promised to do the way he we would know
[22:58] in the revelation of Jesus Christ in the
[23:01] last days will be like it was in the
[23:02] days of Sodom. He promised that
[23:05] revelation to the church when he would
[23:07] be revealed. So don't doubt fear.
[23:12] He's the same yesterday and forever.
[23:14] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[23:14] &gt;&gt; I heard a woman one time when I was
[23:16] talking about him being so great. She
[23:18] said, "There's one thing I have that
[23:20] gets your teaching, Mr. Brandom." I
[23:23] said, "Well, thank you if you only have
[23:25] one thing." I said, "I hope God only
[23:27] finds it that way." And she said, "Well,
[23:29] you brag too much on Jesus." I said, "I
[23:33] hope that's the only thing's against
[23:34] me." And and I said, "I don't brag
[23:36] enough on him." She said, "Oh, yes you
[23:38] do." Said, "You make him divine." Is a
[23:40] woman that didn't believe that Jesus was
[23:42] divine. Just Christian Science. and
[23:44] said, "Um uh you make him uh you make
[23:47] him divine. Make him God." I said, "He's
[23:50] either God or the greatest deceiver the
[23:51] world ever known." I said, "He" said,
[23:54] "Well, I can prove to you by your Bible
[23:56] that he wasn't he was just merely a
[23:58] prophet." I said, "He was a prophet
[24:00] truly, but he was God also." Said he was
[24:02] a man and he was mortal. I said, "That's
[24:05] true." Also, she said on the road down
[24:08] to raise Lazarus from the grave, uh St.
[24:11] John the 11th chapter said the Bible
[24:13] said Jesus wept. I said that's true. She
[24:16] said well that proves that he couldn't
[24:18] be divine and weeping. I said oh my lady
[24:21] is that your argument? I said that's a
[24:24] weak one. She said I said true. He was a
[24:27] man when he was weeping. But when he put
[24:29] it his little body in motion pulled his
[24:33] little shoulders back and said Lazarus
[24:35] come forth. And a man that had been dead
[24:38] four days and was rotten in the grave,
[24:40] stood on his feet and lived again. That
[24:41] was more than a man.
[24:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[24:44] &gt;&gt; That was God.
[24:46] &gt;&gt; He was a man
[24:47] &gt;&gt; out here in this boat that night. When
[24:49] he's out on the sea where 10,000 devils
[24:51] of the sea swore they drowned him. That
[24:54] little old boat tossed about like a
[24:55] bottle stopper out there on the stormy
[24:57] sea. He was a man tired, sleeping. But
[25:01] when they awakened him and called him on
[25:02] the scene, he put one foot up on the
[25:05] brail and looked up and said, "Peace be
[25:06] still." And the winds and the waves
[25:08] obeyed him. That was more than a man.
[25:10] That was God.
[25:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[25:12] &gt;&gt; He was a man when he come down off the
[25:15] mountain hungry, looking on a tree to
[25:17] find something to eat. He was a man when
[25:19] he was hungry. But when he taken five
[25:21] biscuits and two fish and fed 5,000,
[25:23] that was more than a man. That was God
[25:25] in that man. Yes.
[25:28] &gt;&gt; Every person that's ever mounted to a
[25:29] hill of beans has been people who
[25:32] believe that,
[25:33] &gt;&gt; right? Poets and what more believe that
[25:36] that God was in Christ reconciling
[25:38] himself to the world. And now Christ is
[25:41] in the church reconciling the people to
[25:44] God.
[25:45] &gt;&gt; He promised to do it. It has been
[25:47] written that he's the same yesterday,
[25:49] today, and forever. Do you believe that?
[25:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[25:52] &gt;&gt; I believe it with all my heart. that is
[25:54] just waiting now to be called on the
[25:56] scene.
[25:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[25:57] &gt;&gt; Now, the only thing could call him on
[25:59] the scene is for us to awaken him in
[26:01] ourselves.
[26:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[26:03] &gt;&gt; Call him on the scene.
[26:06] &gt;&gt; It was the greatest gift that God ever
[26:07] gave the world. God so loved the world
[26:10] that he gave his only begotten son.
[26:12] Whosoever believeth in him not perish
[26:14] have eternal life. Watch God in his
[26:17] gift. Now, the people used God's gift. a
[26:20] little woman one time she believed that
[26:22] that he was the manifestation of God in
[26:25] flesh. And she said, "If I touch his
[26:27] garment, I I I'll be made whole." Now,
[26:31] she touched his garment and he turned
[26:33] around and said, "Who touched me?" See,
[26:36] virtue, strength has gone from me. She
[26:38] touched his garment. That was her using
[26:41] God's gift.
[26:42] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[26:42] &gt;&gt; See, he got weak from that. But when he
[26:45] went away from the home of Lazarus,
[26:48] remember St. John 5:19, Jesus said,
[26:51] "Verily, verily, I say unto you, the Son
[26:54] can do nothing in himself, but what he
[26:57] sees the Father doing."
[26:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[27:00] &gt;&gt; Remember, Jesus Christ never performed
[27:03] one miracle, never did anything in the
[27:07] way of the supernatural until first he
[27:09] saw a vision on what to do.
[27:12] &gt;&gt; Yes. Right?
[27:13] &gt;&gt; How many believe that to be the truth?
[27:14] St. John, verily, not what I hear, not
[27:17] what somebody tells me,
[27:19] &gt;&gt; what I see the father doing, that doeth
[27:22] the son likewise.
[27:23] &gt;&gt; Now, if that isn't so, then the rest of
[27:25] scripture isn't so. Verily, verily, I
[27:27] say unto you, the son can do nothing in
[27:29] himself, but what he sees the father
[27:31] doing, that doeth the son. The father
[27:34] worketh and I workketh the other two. In
[27:35] other words, he just acted out, done
[27:37] what God told him to do. Now remember
[27:40] when he went away from the home of
[27:42] Lazarus
[27:44] he's gone several days Lazarus got sick
[27:46] and they sent for him he didn't go few
[27:48] days later Lazarus got sicker so they
[27:50] sent for him again he still didn't go
[27:52] then when the appropriated time the
[27:54] father had showed him what happened
[27:55] Lazarus died and he turned when Lazarus
[27:58] died said Lazarus's dead and I'm glad
[28:00] for your sake I wasn't there and they'd
[28:02] been wanting to pray for him and so
[28:03] forth he just done what God told him to
[28:06] do what he saw a vision
[28:07] &gt;&gt; so he had seen a vision know what to do.
[28:10] But I go wake him.
[28:12] &gt;&gt; There you are.
[28:13] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[28:14] &gt;&gt; Watch tomorrow. If they're coming to see
[28:16] him, she said, "Lord, if thou would have
[28:19] been here, my brother would not have
[28:20] died. But even now, whatever you ask
[28:22] God, God will give it to you." See, he
[28:24] knowed what he was going to do. Watch
[28:26] him at the grave of Lazarus. He said,
[28:28] "Father, I thank thee thou heard me
[28:29] already, but I just said it for these
[28:31] who stand by. Lazarus, come forth."
[28:34] &gt;&gt; And Lazarus raised from the dead. Now he
[28:36] never said a thing about getting wheat
[28:38] there. That was God using his gift
[28:41] &gt;&gt; and the people using God's gift was
[28:44] different or he was the word and the
[28:47] word is sharper than a two-edged sword
[28:49] says the Bible and discerns the thoughts
[28:52] and intents of the heart.
[28:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[28:54] &gt;&gt; That proves that God is in the midst of
[28:57] the people.
[28:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[28:59] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[29:00] &gt;&gt; Let us believe it. He's ready according
[29:04] to his word to be called on the scene
[29:07] tonight. How many here sick and needy?
[29:09] Raise up your hands. Let's see your
[29:10] hands. How many sick and needy
[29:13] &gt;&gt; anyone?
[29:14] The only thing he's waiting for is to be
[29:16] called on the scene.
[29:19] &gt;&gt; Just ask him. Now, what if he was
[29:21] standing here with this suit that he
[29:22] gave me
[29:24] &gt;&gt; and you come up in front of him and
[29:26] said, "Lord Jesus, I want you to heal
[29:27] me." You know what he'd say? I've
[29:29] already done it.
[29:30] &gt;&gt; That's right. That's right.
[29:31] &gt;&gt; He was wounded for our transgressions.
[29:33] With his stripes, we were healed.
[29:35] &gt;&gt; You can't do it the second time.
[29:38] &gt;&gt; So, see, he's already done it.
[29:40] &gt;&gt; You have to believe it.
[29:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:42] &gt;&gt; There's nothing you can doritorial to
[29:44] anything to to earn your salvation or
[29:46] healing. There's nothing you can do
[29:48] about it. It's a free gift of God.
[29:50] &gt;&gt; See, it's grace, a free gift. If I give
[29:54] you a million dollars and you straighten
[29:56] up my tie, I didn't give it to you. You
[29:57] done something for it. See, God's gift
[30:00] is free. The only thing you have to do
[30:02] is believe it that he has purchased this
[30:05] for you.
[30:07] &gt;&gt; You It's already purchased. He did it
[30:10] for you. And there's not a man in the
[30:12] world.
[30:14] &gt;&gt; I don't know what you've had here in
[30:15] Baton Rouge. Everything's drifting the
[30:18] country. Impersonations and we know
[30:20] that's just got to be that way. But when
[30:22] a man comes in and tell you he has power
[30:24] to heal you, he's lying.
[30:27] God alone can heal. I'm the Lord thy God
[30:29] who heals all thy diseases.
[30:31] &gt;&gt; He'll not share his glory with anybody.
[30:33] There's no man has power to heal. But
[30:36] there's man who has gifts
[30:38] to manifest God. Your pastor, pardon me,
[30:43] he can take God by a gift of of a
[30:45] teacher. He can explain the word. So
[30:48] you're bound to see it. If you got any
[30:49] eyes to see with, you'll see it. There's
[30:52] another maybe some other gift. But
[30:54] there's always a gift that manifests the
[30:57] presence of God.
[31:00] &gt;&gt; And through there, you yourself have to
[31:02] believe it. A sinner might come here at
[31:04] the altar as a young man or woman at the
[31:07] age of 14 years old and they bring you
[31:09] your meal here and you cry to the Lord
[31:12] until you were 90 years old, you'd never
[31:15] be saved.
[31:17] &gt;&gt; But the you've got to first accept what
[31:20] he done for you.
[31:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. See, you've got to accept it
[31:24] yourself.
[31:26] &gt;&gt; Then when you accept it, then he is the
[31:29] high priest mediator to make
[31:32] intercessions upon your confession of
[31:34] what you believe. Now that's the same
[31:36] thing by a gift this way. It's getting
[31:39] your own mind away from you
[31:42] and then see what he says do. I see
[31:46] people come to the platform, they jump
[31:48] up and down and scream and say, "Oh,
[31:50] Brother Brandham, I got all faith in the
[31:51] world." What are you doing up here then?
[31:54] &gt;&gt; Yeah,
[31:56] &gt;&gt; that's that's emotion, not faith.
[32:00] Genuine wine faith knows no defeat. It's
[32:04] already done.
[32:06] &gt;&gt; It's already over. God said so, and that
[32:09] finishes it. You see, God said so. Now,
[32:11] it's the same thing anytime when you
[32:13] really believe it, that touches him.
[32:16] &gt;&gt; Now, that little woman that touched his
[32:18] garment, she said, "If I but just only
[32:22] touch his garment, I'll be made whole."
[32:25] And she did it. And when she carried out
[32:27] what her faith wanted her to do, touch
[32:30] it, he felt it.
[32:31] &gt;&gt; See, and he turned around and spoke to
[32:34] her. Now, he's the same yesterday,
[32:36] today, and forever. If you will just
[32:39] only believe
[32:43] Christ, believe him. Let your faith
[32:46] touch his garment. And he right now is a
[32:48] high priest that can be touched by the
[32:50] feeling of our infirmities. We all know
[32:52] that.
[32:52] &gt;&gt; And if he's the same yesterday, today,
[32:54] and forever, he'll have to act today as
[32:56] he did yesterday if he's the same high
[32:58] priest.
[32:58] &gt;&gt; Now, won't you believe it?
[33:00] &gt;&gt; It's to have faith in God. If I've told
[33:02] you a lie, then God won't back it up.
[33:05] Well, if God told you the truth, he
[33:07] he'll back it. He's obligated to back
[33:09] the truth up. Jesus said, "I I have a
[33:12] witness, and the witness is God's word."
[33:14] Of course, the the scriptures testify of
[33:16] me. If they don't testify me, then don't
[33:18] believe it. See, and if the scriptures
[33:20] doesn't testify of what I'm telling you
[33:21] now, that he's the same yesterday,
[33:22] today, and forever, then don't believe
[33:23] the scripture because the scripture said
[33:25] he was. And he promised these things for
[33:28] this last age. Remember, just at the end
[33:31] of the Jewish age, that's how he
[33:32] revealed himself Messiah. the end of the
[33:35] the age of the Samaritans, he did the
[33:37] same. Now it's the end of the Gentile
[33:39] age. He's the same yesterday, today, and
[33:41] forever. Await him in your conscious.
[33:43] Call him on the scene while we bow our
[33:45] heads.
[33:50] &gt;&gt; Heavenly Father, just a word from you
[33:53] now will be as sufficient. It'll be all
[33:56] that we need. Just a word from you.
[34:00] May the people clearly understand what
[34:03] the achievement what we're trying to do,
[34:05] Lord, is to is to let them get the
[34:08] benefits of the Lord Jesus that they
[34:11] love and serve. May they do it tonight,
[34:15] Lord, because your death was not in
[34:17] vain. You were wounded for our
[34:19] transgressions, bruised for our
[34:20] iniquity. The chast peace is upon, and
[34:24] with the stripes we were healed. I pray
[34:27] God that everyone in here in divine
[34:29] presence will understand this and will
[34:33] get the vision and will be healed for
[34:36] the glory of God. Through Jesus Christ's
[34:39] name, I present myself with this
[34:42] congregation
[34:44] to his honor and glory. Amen.
[34:49] I'll be real reverent just for a few
[34:50] minutes. I just a word from him would
[34:54] mean more than all I could say or all
[34:57] anyone else could say because it's him
[35:01] doing it. He is the one. He's the doer
[35:05] and we are trusting that the the Lord
[35:08] Jesus will grant these things to you.
[35:10] Now each one now let's see what time I
[35:15] didn't was that [clears throat] I tell
[35:17] you to get out your own time what we
[35:20] supposed to. We haven't the time to
[35:22] bring up this line. Let's call it right
[35:24] from the audience. Now, let's just take
[35:26] the scripture just a minute. Now, the
[35:29] Bible promises
[35:31] in this day that the repeat of Sodom and
[35:35] Gomorrah will be repeated. How many
[35:37] believe that? Now, raise up your hand.
[35:38] The Bible identifies that. Now, and then
[35:43] what was that at Sodom and Gomorrah? It
[35:46] was God in the form of human being.
[35:51] And the way that Abraham noted it is
[35:53] when he said, "Why did Sarah laugh in
[35:56] the tent behind or why did she doubt
[35:57] it?" The words that he had spoke.
