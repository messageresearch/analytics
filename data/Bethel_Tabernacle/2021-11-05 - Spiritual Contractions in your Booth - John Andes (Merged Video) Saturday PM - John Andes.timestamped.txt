[59:16] know you come and you congregate and you
[59:18] gather with people from all over the all
[59:20] over the nation and i know that there's
[59:23] i know because some of you has already
[59:24] expressed it that you came here
[59:27] not just not not just to see your
[59:29] friends that's okay but that's not the
[59:31] only reason you came not just enjoy the
[59:32] swing that was really fun
[59:36] the rock wall whatever you got to do
[59:38] today but you came here with more than a
[59:40] natural need but you've got a spiritual
[59:43] need something upon your heart

[1:05:28] watkins
[1:05:29] brother matthew watkins and the whole
[1:05:31] team the
[1:05:33] bethel tabernacle for giving us such a
[1:05:35] wonderful eve
[1:05:37] weekend would you like to express that
[1:05:47] this might be their first year but the
[1:05:50] whole team and the whole church has
[1:05:51] acted like they've been doing this for
[1:05:54] 20 years
[1:05:55] and we just pray a blessing on them
[1:05:58] and the lord would answer their prayers
[1:06:00] and he's kept you safe today
[1:06:03] my wife said y'all were really uh going
[1:06:05] at it hard today
[1:06:07] and so it's it's easy when we get into a
[1:06:10] comfortable place like this to maybe
[1:06:12] feel like we need to rest but can we
[1:06:14] just do all that next week sometime
[1:06:17] i promise you tonight i won't be as long
[1:06:19] as last night
[1:06:21] we're going to be shorter but we just
[1:06:23] want the lord to have his way
[1:06:26] and
[1:06:27] i put our title on the screen
[1:06:29] tonight
[1:06:30] spiritual contractions
[1:06:32] in your booth
[1:06:34] and i'd like to read this quote again
[1:06:37] that we mentioned last night
[1:06:40] if maybe the brothers could help me go
[1:06:41] to the next slide
[1:06:45] we're working on this
[1:06:48] brother branham said somehow or another
[1:06:50] i just feel we're going there's
[1:06:52] something laying right ahead for us
[1:06:56] just remember i believe i am prophesying
[1:06:59] great joy lays ahead
[1:07:02] believe it
[1:07:03] that's right many saddened hearts will
[1:07:05] be made
[1:07:07] great mysteries will be made clear and
[1:07:10] people who are sad
[1:07:12] will be turned into joy
[1:07:15] wouldn't that be wonderful
[1:07:17] if the lord that that inspiration just
[1:07:19] settled upon this weekend and god would
[1:07:22] just turn many hearts into joy now
[1:07:25] my my little clicker here is not working
[1:07:27] brother so are we plugged in up there
[1:07:30] it'll make it easier for all of us if we
[1:07:32] can
[1:07:34] tonight
[1:07:35] god's just going to go to the heart of
[1:07:37] the matter
[1:07:39] we can talk a lot about all the things
[1:07:41] around
[1:07:42] the issues or the symptoms and we can go
[1:07:45] through all of that as young people
[1:07:47] but we've spoken uh the brothers have
[1:07:49] spoken wonderfully
[1:07:52] and
[1:07:52] it seems like restoration is a theme and
[1:07:56] tonight we'd like to speak about
[1:07:58] restoration of the booths
[1:08:01] and many might not
[1:08:02] maybe understand that or might not have
[1:08:04] heard it like this before and that's why
[1:08:06] we're speaking on it
[1:08:08] and it's a private place it's a personal
[1:08:11] place
[1:08:12] that maybe for years has been neglected
[1:08:14] or lost but god is going to speak on it
[1:08:16] tonight for us
[1:08:18] and going to the next slide
[1:08:20] i can see the brothers are going to have
[1:08:22] to help me now i understand this is a
[1:08:25] youth meeting this is young people's
[1:08:26] weekend
[1:08:28] but uh we're going to be speaking about
[1:08:30] spiritual things and i'm asking everyone
[1:08:32] to be spiritually minded
[1:08:34] and to be mature i believe the young
[1:08:36] people the message are ready for
[1:08:39] the third pool
[1:08:41] i believe that uh it's time now for all
[1:08:43] of us to realize what's happening
[1:08:45] in our lives spiritually is beyond our
[1:08:47] flesh
[1:08:49] it's beyond just someone trying to
[1:08:51] maneuver things or orchestrate it
[1:08:54] who in this room's ever had a birthday
[1:08:56] before
[1:08:59] you have
[1:09:01] some of you haven't but who's had a
[1:09:02] birthday before all right
[1:09:05] what we're speaking about tonight has
[1:09:07] happened then for each one of us
[1:09:09] and it's happened to a mother to a lady
[1:09:13] and that's why we're here that's
[1:09:15] naturally
[1:09:16] and so spiritually though there's
[1:09:19] contractions and there's things that are
[1:09:21] have been going on in your life
[1:09:24] and especially in the last months and
[1:09:26] brother john's just going to labor in
[1:09:28] this area to help you understand
[1:09:30] that it's the holy spirit on you it's
[1:09:32] been his thirst and his uh groaning and
[1:09:36] his spirit
[1:09:38] and i know that there's many that are
[1:09:39] streaming i i heard today from some of
[1:09:42] your parents some of your grandparents
[1:09:44] even from other countries that are
[1:09:47] as we said last night when joel
[1:09:49] prophesied and talked about your
[1:09:50] children's children and children
[1:09:53] we're seeing that manifested right in
[1:09:55] this weekend brother burley by the cadre
[1:09:57] by the jason brother matthew we're
[1:09:59] seeing the word of god made manifest it
[1:10:02] so in our next slide i wanted you to
[1:10:04] know that it's the lord jesus
[1:10:08] that is in control of this surgery
[1:10:11] how many can see that on the screen
[1:10:13] the lord jesus is just watching every
[1:10:16] word he's
[1:10:17] he's prearranged everything
[1:10:20] he's allowed things to happen
[1:10:22] for this moment
[1:10:25] and when it comes time for the birth
[1:10:28] nothing's going to stop it
[1:10:31] when it comes time for it to happen
[1:10:34] nothing can stop it
[1:10:35] so tonight i want you just to visualize
[1:10:37] in your heart
[1:10:39] it's just like um
[1:10:41] everyone has come around
[1:10:44] and we're just standing here like this
[1:10:46] we're just standing as uh nurses or
[1:10:49] doctors would around
[1:10:51] a life that is about ready to
[1:10:54] have god
[1:10:56] birth them or heal them or deliver them
[1:10:59] we've all created the right atmosphere
[1:11:01] but we're just standing here tonight as
[1:11:03] his assistants just saying come on
[1:11:05] you can do this

[1:11:11] this is your birthday this is your
[1:11:13] season so i want everything has just
[1:11:16] been right
[1:11:18] this is the night
[1:11:21] this is the hour
[1:11:22] let's stand to our feet and turn to our
[1:11:24] scripture the brothers can turn
[1:11:27] to the scripture in john chapter 16.
[1:11:36] john chapter 16
[1:11:38] is the scripture
[1:11:45] we're taking these two thoughts
[1:11:50] of spiritual contractions
[1:11:53] in your booth because
[1:11:58] it's something that is happening
[1:12:01] globally
[1:12:02] but right here tonight in your life into
[1:12:05] us
[1:12:07] this day this scripture is fulfilled
[1:12:10] right in our midst
[1:12:12] john chapter 16 verse 20 jesus is
[1:12:15] speaking
[1:12:16] and in my bible the words of jesus are
[1:12:18] read and so this the whole
[1:12:21] scripture tonight is jesus speaking to
[1:12:24] the young people
[1:12:26] speaking to us speaking to the bride
[1:12:29] john 16 verse 20. verily verily
[1:12:33] i say unto you
[1:12:35] that ye
[1:12:36] shall weep
[1:12:38] and lament
[1:12:40] but the world shall rejoice
[1:12:44] and ye shall be sorrowful
[1:12:48] but your sorrow shall be turned
[1:12:51] into joy
[1:12:53] hallelujah
[1:12:55] a woman when she is in travail we know
[1:12:59] that a woman is a type of the church or
[1:13:01] the bride a woman when she is in travail
[1:13:04] has sorrow
[1:13:06] because her hour is come
[1:13:10] but as soon as she is delivered of the
[1:13:12] child she remembereth no more the
[1:13:15] anguish
[1:13:17] for joy
[1:13:19] that a man is born
[1:13:21] into the world
[1:13:23] are you thinking spiritually right now
[1:13:24] this
[1:13:25] this child that is being born is christ
[1:13:30] and jesus is just laying it right out
[1:13:32] there
[1:13:33] uh more than just a drama but he's
[1:13:34] making it real that while we're going
[1:13:37] through this time of travail and sorrow
[1:13:40] because our hour is come
[1:13:44] but as soon as a woman is delivered of
[1:13:47] this child
[1:13:51] she remembers no more the anguish it's
[1:13:54] isaiah said when we are on that other
[1:13:56] side that none of this will be
[1:13:58] remembered or even come into our minds
[1:14:03] nothing negative nothing outside of
[1:14:06] god's plan will even be able to be in
[1:14:09] the bride's mind throughout the
[1:14:11] millennium and throughout our future
[1:14:13] home
[1:14:14] can we say thank you jesus no
[1:14:17] no bad thoughts no memories of any it
[1:14:19] will not even be remembered or come into
[1:14:22] your mind all the anguish and trouble
[1:14:26] verse 22 and ye now
[1:14:28] therefore have sorrow
[1:14:32] but i will see you again
[1:14:34] jesus speaking and your heart shall
[1:14:36] rejoice and your joy
[1:14:39] no man
[1:14:40] taketh from you verse 23 is our last
[1:14:43] verse
[1:14:44] and in that day
[1:14:46] ye shall ask me nothing
[1:14:48] verily verily i say unto you
[1:14:51] whatsoever you shall ask the father in
[1:14:53] my name
[1:14:57] he'll think about it
[1:14:59] maybe
[1:15:01] how many believe that day is this day
[1:15:03] amen we're living at the time when we
[1:15:06] are no longer children and adolescents
[1:15:09] you've come of age
[1:15:11] and he's not here to stimulate your
[1:15:13] minds
[1:15:14] he's here to stimulate your heart to
[1:15:16] turn you back
[1:15:18] tonight's message is very a mature
[1:15:20] message for the believers
[1:15:23] and here we are
[1:15:24] for such a time as this
[1:15:26] god bless you you can have your seats
[1:15:35] and he
[1:15:37] read the scriptures
[1:15:40] and then gave the scroll to
[1:15:45] the priest
[1:15:48] and when they had all sat down
[1:15:51] he began to say unto them
[1:15:54] this day
[1:15:57] this scripture is fulfilled
[1:16:01] in your ears
[1:16:02] tonight we're saying this scripture is
[1:16:05] being fulfilled
[1:16:06] within the young people of the message
[1:16:09] that the promises
[1:16:12] and the word that has been sown down
[1:16:16] not just through the ages but in your
[1:16:17] day
[1:16:19] is now bursting
[1:16:22] thus saith the lord for this hour
[1:16:25] we have been pregnanted with that
[1:16:28] we've been pregnated by a message of
[1:16:31] thus saith the lord
[1:16:33] and it is now coming to the time for a
[1:16:36] full manifestation
[1:16:38] paul said it like this in romans that
[1:16:41] uh the whole earth is groaning
[1:16:45] they're travailing if someone would be
[1:16:47] able to take this microphone
[1:16:49] out tonight to these trees
[1:16:53] or to the lake out here or to the grass
[1:16:55] that is now wet with the rain
[1:16:58] that god's kept from us today gave you a
[1:17:01] wonderful day did you enjoy the day
[1:17:03] today but if we could take this
[1:17:04] microphone out there and say speak give
[1:17:06] us a voice
[1:17:08] it wouldn't just be laughing and telling
[1:17:11] a joke and wanting to watch a movie it
[1:17:13] would be
[1:17:14] groaning saying where are the sons of
[1:17:18] god
[1:17:19] where are the daughters of god i'm
[1:17:21] groaning
[1:17:22] when are they going to grow when are
[1:17:24] they going to come to maturity when are
[1:17:26] they going to realize the day
[1:17:29] and the hour that they're living in i
[1:17:31] want to say tonight and give a voice
[1:17:33] back out to them here we are lord
[1:17:37] amen here we are lord
[1:17:41] let's not be dull tonight let's not be
[1:17:44] insensitive
[1:17:46] to what god is saying to us right now
[1:17:49] and it's time to awaken our ears our
[1:17:52] eyes our whole lives and say lord be it
[1:17:55] unto me
[1:17:57] according to your word
[1:17:59] bring forth life
[1:18:01] we're not here for a party tonight
[1:18:04] we're not here to just laugh and be
[1:18:07] funny and be goofy
[1:18:09] we want the word to connect yes we do
[1:18:12] with young people but it's got to go
[1:18:14] beyond the now it's got to stretch into
[1:18:16] the eternity where lives can be changed
[1:18:19] forever
[1:18:21] where this groaning
[1:18:24] where there's something that can't even
[1:18:25] be uttered many times from our
[1:18:28] hearts and i'm gonna come down into your
[1:18:30] personal life but god is raising up an
[1:18:33] army tonight and the spiritual
[1:18:36] contractions
[1:18:38] that you've been sensing now
[1:18:40] and they're getting stronger
[1:18:41] contractions are like cramps
[1:18:45] is everybody ready to go into the
[1:18:46] service now what spiritual contractions
[1:18:49] contractions are cramps
[1:18:52] they're spasms
[1:18:55] it's something that's uncontrollable
[1:18:57] that's happening
[1:18:59] in your life and they get closer as the
[1:19:01] time approaches
[1:19:03] they get closer and it's often
[1:19:06] associated with pain
[1:19:09] it's not just
[1:19:11] always running and joyful and happy but
[1:19:14] a travail and a sorrow contractions are
[1:19:17] like there's discomfort it's not easy
[1:19:21] when you speak about the new birth
[1:19:24] or new life
[1:19:25] and every birth has them
[1:19:28] every single one of you
[1:19:30] caused pain
[1:19:31] when you came forth
[1:19:33] so a contraction is actually can you go
[1:19:36] like this with your hands it's a it's a
[1:19:38] tightening then it's a
[1:19:41] flexing then it's
[1:19:42] something that's moving like this and i
[1:19:45] want you to listen really closely
[1:19:47] spiritual
[1:19:48] contractions it's a normal part of
[1:19:51] pregnancy it's something that is
[1:19:53] happening brother branham said it like
[1:19:54] this in birth pains that it takes pain
[1:19:58] it takes distress
[1:20:01] and it takes
[1:20:02] discomfort so the gospel isn't always
[1:20:05] easy
[1:20:06] it's not always running on the mountains
[1:20:11] we're on the mountaintop this weekend
[1:20:13] this is the greatest times of our lives
[1:20:16] are weekends like this
[1:20:18] but we've got to leave on sunday
[1:20:20] afternoon or monday and go down into the
[1:20:22] valley
[1:20:24] but it's the valley that he restores our
[1:20:27] souls
[1:20:29] no fruit is growing on the mountaintop
[1:20:32] any farmer anybody will tell you that
[1:20:35] that raises weed or raises crops that
[1:20:38] it's down in the in the fertile valley
[1:20:41] where it grows and so you cannot remain
[1:20:44] on the mountain
[1:20:46] we don't want to take away your
[1:20:47] mountaintop experience and i'm not here
[1:20:49] to
[1:20:50] to to water that down
[1:20:53] but i'm here to let you know that what
[1:20:55] is happening this contractions
[1:20:58] and this flexing and cramping that
[1:21:00] you've been going through in the end of
[1:21:03] all of that
[1:21:04] these muscle contractions are what will
[1:21:07] help you
[1:21:09] in the labor
[1:21:11] to push that baby
[1:21:13] down the birth channel and out
[1:21:17] so the very pain and the very spasms and
[1:21:20] and there can be false contractions and
[1:21:23] there can be you that are in the back
[1:21:24] you sisters are streaming that's had
[1:21:27] children know that there can be false
[1:21:28] contractions and braxton hicks they call
[1:21:31] it and they're just things that happen
[1:21:33] and you're just bracing and embracing in
[1:21:34] your but it just goes it's a false but
[1:21:37] then there's times when it just builds
[1:21:39] up and and it builds up and you're able
[1:21:41] that's what i was speaking about last
[1:21:43] night just bri
[1:21:45] okay
[1:21:46] just breathe
[1:21:47] and then it's like something in a bit
[1:21:49] you can just feel the pressure
[1:21:51] you can feel the pain it's trying to
[1:21:53] move you into a place you say oh this is
[1:21:56] bad and this isn't this is uncomfortable
[1:21:59] but i'm here to tell you tonight that
[1:22:01] the very thing that has caused this
[1:22:03] contractions in your spiritual life is
[1:22:05] going to help you in the labor
[1:22:08] you needed that to push the baby out the
[1:22:11] birth canal
[1:22:14] and to push it out
[1:22:17] because we've had too many stillborn
[1:22:19] children in the message
[1:22:21] or as our brother that sang the special
[1:22:23] saying for many years he said it was
[1:22:26] just he was around the message raised in
[1:22:27] the message but there has to come a time
[1:22:30] when all of this becomes real
[1:22:33] [Applause]
[1:22:36] in john chapter 16 that we read jesus
[1:22:39] said a woman in travail
[1:22:41] has sorrow maybe the brothers can put up
[1:22:43] john chapter 16 again verse 21
[1:22:49] a woman in travail
[1:22:51] has sorrow
[1:22:53] but there is joy
[1:22:56] at the birth
[1:22:58] there's joy when you see a young lady
[1:23:02] singing a song for the glory of god and
[1:23:04] some of you are just waiting yeah we
[1:23:06] know her we know what happened in the
[1:23:08] cabin or yeah we know that brother and
[1:23:10] we kind of snicker a little bit but do
[1:23:12] you know god is actually doing something
[1:23:14] supernatural even in this atmosphere
[1:23:17] tonight right now you can feel it's
[1:23:19] different that's that contraction that's
[1:23:21] the all the prayers that's all the god
[1:23:24] has dates circled on his calendar for
[1:23:27] there to be births for there to be
[1:23:29] healings for i was listening to brother
[1:23:31] branham just coming in in our room i'm
[1:23:34] just forgetting the message maybe it was
[1:23:37] about samson
[1:23:39] what was that message brother burley
[1:23:42] just once more and brother branham said
[1:23:44] oh i love this he said god is giving you
[1:23:47] back your right mind
[1:23:49] he's given you back your mind and as
[1:23:51] samson was his eyes were out but he was
[1:23:53] moving there god was giving back his
[1:23:56] right mind and i thought god do that for
[1:23:59] our young people tonight
[1:24:01] restoring to them
[1:24:06] give them the mind of christ
[1:24:10] you say my heart is is broken or my
[1:24:13] heart is wayward or my uh my heart is
[1:24:16] just brother john i don't even have the
[1:24:18] desire for god the bible speaks about a
[1:24:21] person like that and it says i will give
[1:24:23] you a new heart
[1:24:25] i will give you a new spirit and i will
[1:24:27] put my spirit in you boy that would be
[1:24:30] wonderful tonight if someone within this
[1:24:32] service god had tonight's date circled
[1:24:35] on his calendar that this was the whole
[1:24:39] burden the whole focus
[1:24:43] of everything
[1:24:45] was for these moments
[1:24:48] wouldn't that be wonderful and we could
[1:24:49] just sense that that a child is being
[1:24:52] born
[1:24:53] there's and we just know
[1:24:55] that there's going to be joy and we know
[1:24:57] that there's going to be deliverance we
[1:24:58] know that we're going to go back home
[1:25:00] different and you say wow their
[1:25:02] attitude's different you can see there's
[1:25:04] light around you i can just see their
[1:25:06] approach that is because god has had his
[1:25:09] way and the contractions that we've been
[1:25:11] feeling for months has led up right to
[1:25:14] this moment
[1:25:18] her hour is come
[1:25:20] jesus said
[1:25:22] and as soon as she is delivered
[1:25:25] of the child
[1:25:27] the spoken word of our day god is
[1:25:30] pregnanted now
[1:25:32] the bride of christ it's been laying in
[1:25:34] the womb of this generation when they
[1:25:37] came out of egypt through moses god
[1:25:40] thought of the generation that was going
[1:25:42] to go into the promised land
[1:25:44] but there had to be fathers there had to
[1:25:46] be mothers there had to be grandparents
[1:25:48] there had to be church services for the
[1:25:51] last 56 years plus since
[1:25:54] 1965 there had to be a wilderness there
[1:25:57] had to be a time there had to be another
[1:26:00] generation there had to be children of
[1:26:03] children of children to show that god's
[1:26:06] word is true
[1:26:09] you ought to be thankful tonight that
[1:26:11] though your eyes have never seen though
[1:26:13] you've never heard physically or been in
[1:26:15] a meeting of brother branham that you
[1:26:16] can say my eyes have seen i've
[1:26:19] experienced
[1:26:20] that the same holy spirit
[1:26:29] the same angel of the lord that stood in
[1:26:31] the branham tabernacle in march 1963 is
[1:26:35] standing behind this pulpit tonight and
[1:26:38] it's not brother john andes
[1:26:40] it's the lamb that broke the shield is
[1:26:43] in this building tonight
[1:26:52] now i've got to stay focused tonight
[1:26:54] tonight we've got to be more focused
[1:26:56] than we were last night god forgive us
[1:27:00] but i want to spiritual contractions
[1:27:03] when you speak to young people you're
[1:27:05] dealing with personal contractions
[1:27:08] you're dealing with relationship
[1:27:10] contractions or spasms there
[1:27:13] there's times when it's good and there's
[1:27:15] times when it goes opposite and you're
[1:27:16] dealing with maybe someone's been
[1:27:18] dealing with relationship contractions
[1:27:20] or contractions in a certain family
[1:27:25] i i remember in poland one year when i
[1:27:27] was preaching there and there was a
[1:27:28] young lady that came to us it was just
[1:27:31] in the front of the building it was
[1:27:33] public but she just began to speak to me
[1:27:35] she was the only young person in her
[1:27:37] church
[1:27:38] there wasn't a bunch of young people
[1:27:40] there wasn't a big crowd
[1:27:42] she was the only young person in her
[1:27:45] youth group and i gave her just a word
[1:27:47] of encouragement as we spoke i said
[1:27:50] sister it won't always be like this
[1:27:53] she lived way up hours away and i mean
[1:27:56] those type of meetings that we were
[1:27:58] having were just so sacred and so
[1:28:00] wonderful to her to be able to come and
[1:28:02] be with other brothers and sisters but i
[1:28:04] said it won't always be like this
[1:28:07] and do you know within less than a year
[1:28:10] there was another brother that was in
[1:28:11] the camp meetings and in the convention
[1:28:13] that was a very
[1:28:14] i would say he's one of the leading
[1:28:16] young men and leaders of
[1:28:18] of the message then and he was just they
[1:28:20] were out on the streets witnessing they
[1:28:21] were on fire and they were just and
[1:28:23] within a year that that young brother
[1:28:26] and that sister became in a relationship
[1:28:29] and now they have they're married and
[1:28:30] have children and when you go to czech
[1:28:32] republic or go to poland you'll see this

[1:33:28] holy spirit wanting to say something
[1:33:31] right now

[1:33:47] god knew you before you were even in the
[1:33:50] womb
[1:33:52] he made sure that you came out of the
[1:33:54] womb

[1:34:01] and weeping that you have gone through
[1:34:04] personally
[1:34:06] all of the wailing
[1:34:12] and the travail
[1:34:15] the old testament says
[1:34:18] mark those
[1:34:21] that are shying
[1:34:23] and crying
[1:34:25] that have a burden in the message
[1:34:28] in the city

[1:34:34] that are interested
[1:34:37] they're interested in
[1:34:39] a son being born a daughter being born

[1:34:45] so full of feminists and they want to
[1:34:47] have a career before they have a baby
[1:34:49] they don't want their bodies to be
[1:34:51] deformed it shows the spirit of satan
[1:34:53] that is god on the human race it's a
[1:34:55] perversion
[1:34:57] when god is trying to get a bride
[1:34:59] pregnant with his word
[1:35:02] you know what i'm talking about tonight
[1:35:04] and all of the travailing whale
[1:35:07] now i'm speaking as a minister that's
[1:35:09] been born and raised in the message
[1:35:13] and the burden on your heart the
[1:35:15] groaning
[1:35:16] behind the scenes of you as a young
[1:35:18] person

[1:35:25] and you feel
[1:35:27] weird you feel strange it's not home to
[1:35:30] you
[1:35:33] in your bedroom in your closet maybe you
[1:35:36] just maybe you have to share with a
[1:35:38] sister with a brother and maybe you have
[1:35:40] a little closet or something and god
[1:35:42] sees you when you close the door god
[1:35:44] sees you
[1:35:47] my my mind is just going right now i
[1:35:50] remember specifically when i was a
[1:35:52] teenager and i i don't know why i'm
[1:35:54] going to say this but i was just turned
[1:35:56] 18 years old and i was a night manager
[1:35:58] at a grocery store and there'd been
[1:36:00] something happen at the front and the
[1:36:02] registers we were open 24 hours and i
[1:36:04] was checking out some people and i'd put
[1:36:07] all the money all the cash brother cadre
[1:36:09] from my collected from all the teals in
[1:36:11] a grocery bag and i just put it behind
[1:36:14] me because i was checking out someone
[1:36:16] and when i turned around it was gone
[1:36:19] all the checks all the cash
[1:36:21] oh my
[1:36:24] this is horrible and i just walked
[1:36:26] through the store and went back into the
[1:36:27] back of the restroom i'm just going to
[1:36:29] be open with you and as i shut the door
[1:36:32] he was there
[1:36:34] you know young people he's going to be
[1:36:36] there
[1:36:38] you say this is private or you say i'm
[1:36:40] just going to close the door no god is
[1:36:43] god knows what you're going through
[1:36:47] in your closet in your bedroom when
[1:36:48] you're in your car
[1:36:51] on your job
[1:36:52] when you're all alone or when you're
[1:36:54] with others
[1:36:56] you sense this travail this burden and
[1:36:58] you don't know maybe up till tonight
[1:37:01] what is it why do i feel this way
[1:37:05] it's spiritual contractions
[1:37:08] it's that seed inside of you it's that
[1:37:10] spasming it's that it's that you you
[1:37:13] cannot control this you you don't know
[1:37:15] its destiny but god does
[1:37:18] and i just encourage every person
[1:37:20] tonight just yield to that
[1:37:23] let's all say yield
[1:37:26] and as you've gone through these last
[1:37:28] years in these last months
[1:37:30] some of you been isolated and i spent a
[1:37:33] long time on it last night some of you
[1:37:34] have been separated from loved ones and
[1:37:37] distance and it hasn't been normal
[1:37:42] for none of us
[1:37:44] but god has seen your travail he's seen
[1:37:47] your sign
[1:37:49] even if you parents even of you older
[1:37:51] ones even churches now even ministers i
[1:37:55] one of my minister friends that's an
[1:37:57] elder in this message
[1:38:00] he was gonna resign after the sunday
[1:38:02] night service there been so much
[1:38:04] confusion in the church about you know
[1:38:06] should we be having services should we
[1:38:08] not and there's people saying oh i think
[1:38:10] we should be having services let's have
[1:38:11] services another said no we shouldn't be
[1:38:13] having service we're not gonna he was
[1:38:15] going to resign on the sunday night
[1:38:19] and there was a visiting minister was in
[1:38:20] his church brother jason came through
[1:38:22] that sunday preached the morning and
[1:38:25] preached tonight and god dealt mightily
[1:38:27] in that church and in that in that
[1:38:30] pastor's assembly and he got up at the
[1:38:32] end of the service the pastor and he
[1:38:33] said i was going to resign
[1:38:35] this sunday night but god has changed my
[1:38:38] heart
[1:38:39] see it's not just young people that are
[1:38:42] going through issues it's not just young
[1:38:44] people
[1:38:45] we have young people's camps we have
[1:38:47] young people things but sometimes i
[1:38:49] wonder if we ought to have 40-0 and a
[1:38:51] plus and oh would y'all like that just
[1:39:00] young people aren't the problem
[1:39:03] they're a product of their families
[1:39:06] they're a product of their churches
[1:39:09] i know i need to be careful here friends
[1:39:11] but i have in my notes written notes
[1:39:14] that
[1:39:14] young people thrive under supernatural
[1:39:18] atmosphere they thrive when the holy
[1:39:21] ghost is moving
[1:39:23] [Applause]
[1:39:25] young people feed on the word they love
[1:39:27] holy ghost film music they love to be
[1:39:30] around people that love them
[1:39:33] people that would die for them
[1:39:36] they thrive under that
[1:39:38] but i understand
[1:39:40] and i wrote this in my notes in
[1:39:42] washington
[1:39:43] before i came here
[1:39:44] many young people
[1:39:46] that attend special meetings like this
[1:39:49] go back to a home
[1:39:51] that does not have a nurturing
[1:39:53] atmosphere
[1:39:58] we have great times and brother burley
[1:40:00] can minister brother cadre is going to
[1:40:02] minister brother jason and brother
[1:40:03] matthew he's just done i think he's
[1:40:06] incredible what brother matthew and i i
[1:40:09] was with him last night in a personal in
[1:40:12] a personal time with another brother not
[1:40:14] just to see the wisdom of god upon his
[1:40:17] life but i know there's young people
[1:40:19] here that are not going back to a home
[1:40:22] that is nurturing
[1:40:25] they're not going back to an environment
[1:40:27] that is encouraging them it's they're
[1:40:30] going back home
[1:40:31] to people that's going to look down on
[1:40:33] them and say oh yeah we'll see how you
[1:40:35] are in three weeks
[1:40:39] maybe they're going back to an
[1:40:40] atmosphere even in their church where
[1:40:42] there's a lot of skepticism and
[1:40:45] and trouble
[1:40:47] so god give us
[1:40:49] a supernatural atmosphere well we're
[1:40:51] together like this
[1:40:53] my heart is groaning
[1:40:57] we all want a revival we all want to see
[1:41:00] a move of god
[1:41:02] but are we really willing to be honest
[1:41:04] enough and humble enough
[1:41:08] this past year i was speaking to a
[1:41:10] father
[1:41:11] in the messaging can i be open tonight
[1:41:14] we're talking about contractions and
[1:41:15] we're talking about things we're going
[1:41:17] through in the message and as young
[1:41:19] people
[1:41:20] i was talking to the father and just
[1:41:22] discussing his teenage daughter she's a
[1:41:24] beautiful young lady
[1:41:28] beautiful young teenager raised in a
[1:41:30] message church and
[1:41:32] you know i seen her in the meetings and
[1:41:34] i see
[1:41:35] her and her family
[1:41:38] i actually saw her at a place of work
[1:41:40] where she was and
[1:41:42] she had earrings on and
[1:41:45] you could just see through the side of
[1:41:47] her
[1:41:47] shirt her bra and everything and
[1:41:51] she needed the lord
[1:41:55] but what was so amazing when speaking to
[1:41:57] her father
[1:41:58] he was just giving me the testimonies
[1:42:00] and talking about his family and his
[1:42:02] life said oh i know she has the holy
[1:42:05] ghost i know my daughter has the holy
[1:42:07] ghost and
[1:42:09] i didn't say anything to my precious
[1:42:11] brother
[1:42:12] and friend but i thought are we talking
[1:42:15] about the same person
[1:42:18] this person lives with you this person
[1:42:21] is in your home and yet publicly it's so
[1:42:23] obvious she's struggling
[1:42:25] she's not where she's not just
[1:42:27] struggling she's manifesting a lot she's
[1:42:29] crying out
[1:42:32] and i thought god help all of us
[1:42:34] not to be so deceived
[1:42:37] we can be right in an environment and
[1:42:39] think everything's okay
[1:42:41] and it's not okay
[1:42:46] just today just between services you
[1:42:48] know we went back to our room again and
[1:42:50] and was alone and i was able to view
[1:42:54] a wedding of brother ben steeman from
[1:42:56] florida and sister adriana pruitt they
[1:42:58] were married this afternoon and i
[1:43:00] thought of these families and thought of
[1:43:02] a young couple that has been probably
[1:43:04] influenced most of you and you've been
[1:43:06] around them or seen their brother danny
[1:43:09] steeman is the pastor and brother tim
[1:43:11] pruitt which we dearly love but for them
[1:43:13] to be married this afternoon and know
[1:43:15] they can live their lives before they're
[1:43:17] married and now after they're married
[1:43:23] we're really quiet tonight
[1:43:25] but god has given you
[1:43:27] a virgin womb and he's given you a
[1:43:29] spiritual virgin womb and we ought to be
[1:43:32] fighting for that with everything that's
[1:43:34] within us
[1:43:36] guard your heart i speak to all of the
[1:43:39] beautiful young ladies and all the young
[1:43:41] men guard your heart
[1:43:44] don't trade it for treasure don't trade
[1:43:47] it for a job or career a fast car
[1:43:53] don't let your heart get taken by the
[1:43:55] world
[1:43:56] and regret your decisions later this is
[1:44:00] where we're having these meetings
[1:44:02] to create an atmosphere around you
[1:44:06] how many knows what i'm talking about
[1:44:07] when i say crying out or groaning or
[1:44:10] travail

[1:48:02] this went on for years all the way to
[1:48:04] the
[1:48:05] brother joshua and
[1:48:08] when joshua crushed jordan was
[1:48:12] 1451
[1:48:13] bc
[1:48:15] now what we're reading tonight is the
[1:48:18] year 445
[1:48:20] over a thousand years later
[1:48:23] since joshua is everyone listening let's
[1:48:25] say joshua
[1:48:28] it wasn't in the message
[1:48:30] they neglected booths
[1:48:32] we're going to read it in just a few
[1:48:34] minutes but for since the days of joshua
[1:48:36] the son of none until the day had not
[1:48:38] the children of israel done so it's like
[1:48:40] what's a booth
[1:48:42] what the booth
[1:48:44] we all want revival we all want everyone
[1:48:46] to
[1:48:47] have authority and come to your place
[1:48:49] but if you neglect the booth
[1:48:51] you're just going to keep going around
[1:48:53] in circles
[1:48:55] nehemiah chapter 8 verse 14. now this is
[1:48:58] ezra standing up
[1:49:00] behind the pulpit
[1:49:05] nehemiah 8 14. and they found written in
[1:49:08] the law this is what was leviticus they
[1:49:10] found
[1:49:11] which the lord had commanded by moses
[1:49:13] that the children of israel should dwell
[1:49:15] in booths
[1:49:17] in the feast
[1:49:18] of the seventh month
[1:49:20] now if i can just have your attention
[1:49:22] the seventh month for the jewish race
[1:49:25] was october
[1:49:27] this very month that we're in tonight
[1:49:29] for the jews
[1:49:31] was a season of the booths and then the
[1:49:33] feast of tabernacles
[1:49:35] and verse 14 that we just read was that
[1:49:38] they found it it's in the book of
[1:49:40] leviticus what we just read that the
[1:49:42] children of israel should dwell in booze
[1:49:44] in the feast
[1:49:46] of the seventh month
[1:49:47] verse 15
[1:49:49] and that they should publish and
[1:49:51] proclaim in all their cities
[1:49:54] in johnson city and florida and
[1:49:57] phoenix and idaho and south carolina
[1:50:01] north carolina
[1:50:03] hello
[1:50:04] i know those are states but i don't know
[1:50:06] all the cities you're from but here we
[1:50:07] are
[1:50:09] saying go forth unto the mount and fetch
[1:50:12] olive branches and pine branches and
[1:50:14] myrtle branches and palm branches and
[1:50:17] branches of thick trees
[1:50:19] to make booths as it is written so the
[1:50:22] people went forth and brought them and
[1:50:24] made themselves booths
[1:50:27] everyone upon the roof of his house
[1:50:31] and in their courts
[1:50:33] and in the courts of the house of god
[1:50:35] and in the streets of the watergate and
[1:50:37] in the street of the gate of ephraim
[1:50:39] verse 17 and all the congregation of
[1:50:42] them
[1:50:44] that were come again out of the
[1:50:46] captivity made booze
[1:50:48] or the message
[1:50:50] struck their hearts
[1:50:53] everyone started to make booths
[1:50:57] and sat under the booths
[1:51:00] for since the days of joshua that's
[1:51:02] jeshua the son of none until that day
[1:51:05] had not the children of israel done so
[1:51:08] and there was very great gladness
[1:51:11] like it's going to be at the end of the
[1:51:13] service it's going to be like wow when
[1:51:15] the word goes forth and when we see that
[1:51:18] it's hit the mark and god's going to
[1:51:20] answer your prayers personally great joy
[1:51:22] is manifested
[1:51:24] but you've got to go through the travail
[1:51:26] you've got to go through the season and
[1:51:28] what are we going to do and how we're
[1:51:29] going to get there it's going to be by
[1:51:31] making booze
[1:51:33] brothers if you could go to that on the
[1:51:35] slides i'd really appreciate that are
[1:51:37] the slides that we can go to right now
[1:51:40] so i thought i'd make some pictures of
[1:51:42] boo so that we'd all get to understand a
[1:51:44] booth
[1:51:46] it's like a thicket
[1:51:49] it's like a covert or a booth was a rude
[1:51:52] temporary shelter
[1:51:54] kind of like your body it's temporary
[1:51:58] you're gonna get a new body
[1:52:01] who's going to get a new body i mean
[1:52:04] right now you're going through travail
[1:52:05] and sorrow and dying all of us are dying
[1:52:09] say brother john how can i have the holy
[1:52:11] ghost or how can i have a born-again
[1:52:13] experience and feel so sad or weary or
[1:52:16] dreary we all are groaning
[1:52:20] we all are under travail
[1:52:25] but a booth
[1:52:26] it was a rude temporary shelter like a
[1:52:29] hedge with a fence around it like being
[1:52:32] shut in it was like
[1:52:34] let's make booze and let's get in there
[1:52:36] it was like a temporary shelter where
[1:52:38] you could kneel down where you could
[1:52:40] pray it wasn't for the public crowd
[1:52:45] a booth was something that you were to
[1:52:47] do yourself
[1:52:49] to prepare for the feast
[1:52:52] see everybody wants the feast they want
[1:52:54] the good times they want the revival but
[1:52:56] they're not willing to grab
[1:52:58] look at this fetch olive branches pine
[1:53:00] branches myrtle branches and palm
[1:53:02] branches branches of thick to make booze
[1:53:05] as it is written what is a booth it's
[1:53:08] something that is to block out
[1:53:12] it's to something overshadow and screen
[1:53:14] you
[1:53:15] to stop the approach
[1:53:17] to shut in to cover oneself it is a
[1:53:21] protector

[2:01:36] like a booth this is
[2:01:37] what a booth was it was something that
[2:01:39] was
[2:01:40] overshadowed and it was weaved together
[2:01:42] you got in there
[2:01:44] it was a place of prayer
[2:01:49] this is what it was in leviticus it was
[2:01:51] the feast of tabernacles there had to be
[2:01:53] booze everyone had to make their own
[2:01:56] booth this is speaking of the last
[2:01:58] pilgrim festival it lasted a week and
[2:02:01] this is where the booze
[2:02:02] were built during this time a season of
[2:02:04] rejoicing
[2:02:07] they're kind of crude looking they're
[2:02:08] kind of you know it's not fancy
[2:02:12] and here they they try to
[2:02:15] to worship and bring it up today this is
[2:02:17] just some visuals for you on the right
[2:02:20] is maybe a little bit more what they
[2:02:22] were trying to do in jerusalem and
[2:02:24] israel they're trying to keep a feast
[2:02:26] bring the branches let's it's not a huge
[2:02:29] massive place where you invite everybody
[2:02:31] it's a more of a private booth where
[2:02:34] there's
[2:02:35] let me just say it like this for us
[2:02:36] tonight a booth speaks of a place of
[2:02:39] consecration and a greater dedication
[2:02:43] where god could restore and bring back a
[2:02:46] spiritual life
[2:02:49] that is consecrated and fully
[2:02:52] surrendered to christ
[2:02:55] that's what i'm speaking about tonight
[2:02:57] young people
[2:03:03] i love when you clap i love when you
[2:03:04] worship i love to see you happy i love
[2:03:06] to see you respond but i'm not here for
[2:03:09] a momentary little
[2:03:11] injection or standing behind the pulpit
[2:03:14] tonight
[2:03:16] just for some glory of ourselves
[2:03:20] we're here friends that you as a person
[2:03:24] would understand that what you're going
[2:03:25] through the spiritual things and the
[2:03:28] contractions has been the holy spirit
[2:03:30] and he's inviting you into a booth
[2:03:35] not a public show
[2:03:37] this isn't for everybody to know
[2:03:41] this is for you to run into and say lord
[2:03:44] i love you with all of my heart and i
[2:03:46] worship you on monday i love you on
[2:03:49] tuesday
[2:04:00] we read it in the book of nehemiah that
[2:04:02] since the days of joshua they had not
[2:04:04] celebrated this 1 000 years listen
[2:04:08] really close a thousand years
[2:04:12] they had stopped making booths
[2:04:17] in the church
[2:04:18] in the young people they didn't know
[2:04:20] what it was to be consecrated they
[2:04:22] didn't know what it was to have a fully
[2:04:24] surrendered personal walk with god it
[2:04:26] had been neglected
[2:04:28] and i say tonight from 1965
[2:04:32] to 2021 is 56 years since our prophet
[2:04:35] has left
[2:04:38] but i'm announcing to you there is a
[2:04:40] generation
[2:04:42] that god is restoring and bringing back
[2:04:45] their right minds that we must have a
[2:04:48] personal
[2:04:49] daily
[2:04:51] humble walk with god
[2:05:02] true worshipers worship god in a
[2:05:04] personal private booth in jeffersonville
[2:05:07] brother branham said god bless those who
[2:05:09] raise their hands
[2:05:11] they're desiring that lovely life of
[2:05:13] full consecrated sanctified filled with
[2:05:16] the holy spirit dedicated to god washed
[2:05:19] in the blood they long for it they're
[2:05:22] waiting
[2:05:26] okay
[2:05:27] i'm just going to put it in words for
[2:05:29] you
[2:05:33] you're longing for it
[2:05:36] you're waiting
[2:05:40] it's like we're a body but we're just
[2:05:42] kind of
[2:05:43] walking softly like brother branham
[2:05:45] would stand and say if you've noticed
[2:05:47] i've been speaking for a little while
[2:05:49] i'm just waiting i'm waiting for him to
[2:05:52] come it's not that all the other words
[2:05:54] were filler it's not that there wasn't
[2:05:57] something throughout the other part of
[2:05:59] the service but he had learned to wait
[2:06:03] then he would say he's here
[2:06:08] and he talked about a three-room house
[2:06:11] he said no matter how big of a house you
[2:06:13] live in we all live in a three-room
[2:06:15] house
[2:06:16] and the first is the kitchen
[2:06:20] then the parlor or the living room
[2:06:23] then the third room is the bedroom
[2:06:27] number one the kitchen is like the
[2:06:28] church it's where we all come together
[2:06:30] and we feed on the word it's so
[2:06:32] wonderful who likes to eat
[2:06:36] well that's wonderful to come to camp
[2:06:37] but i know some of you are going to want
[2:06:39] to get back home and eat

[2:06:43] motel he said man i'm glad i came with
[2:06:45] you today where are we going to eat a
[2:06:46] little something we went to a little

[2:10:43] look at this tonight
[2:10:46] this is a booth
[2:10:48] this is a place where spiritual
[2:10:50] contractions are
[2:10:51] happen in your booth
[2:10:57] this is what we're talking about about
[2:11:00] the bride of christ it's time to bring
[2:11:02] forth
[2:11:05] it's contractions do i have a
[2:11:07] we've reached the end of that
[2:11:10] praise the lord
[2:11:15] so tonight
[2:11:20] the world is calling to you
[2:11:24] and god is calling to you
[2:11:27] who are you going to answer to
[2:11:30] can i speak now from my heart
[2:11:33] the world has its enchantments for all
[2:11:36] of you
[2:11:38] and there are things that turn you on
[2:11:40] and there it might not even trouble the
[2:11:42] brother next to you or the sister next
[2:11:44] there's enchantments and there's things
[2:11:46] that
[2:11:47] satan wants you to default back to
[2:11:51] you're not of this world
[2:11:53] you don't even fit in good
[2:11:56] let me just be honest over the last few
[2:11:58] years there's been people leave the
[2:12:00] message
[2:12:01] i've known a lot of them very personally
[2:12:05] and their children
[2:12:06] do you know what happens they end up
[2:12:08] worse than people in the world
[2:12:11] how many can testify you've seen that
[2:12:13] their hair grows pink green yellow
[2:12:17] they turn into homosexuals and lesbians
[2:12:20] and they're you know now they used to be
[2:12:22] speak against alcohol you shouldn't
[2:12:24] drink alcohol now they're just so happy
[2:12:26] to post they got their beer
[2:12:28] they're so free now
[2:12:30] we can all do whatever we want to do
[2:12:32] what you've always wanted to do
[2:12:36] they never responded to the spiritual
[2:12:39] contractions
[2:12:41] they didn't understand what birth pains
[2:12:43] was or they got embarrassed when you
[2:12:45] talked about it their face got all red
[2:12:48] they couldn't go all the way to
[2:12:50] pentecost they kind of stumbled around
[2:12:53] some of them were worship leaders
[2:12:57] some of them were dynamic pastors
[2:13:02] some of them were young people that
[2:13:03] could sing a special and give a
[2:13:05] testimony and some of you would say it
[2:13:07] like this they brought the house down
[2:13:11] and tonight
[2:13:12] they're worse than people in the world
[2:13:16] they've gone crazy times 10.
[2:13:20] and you always wonder
[2:13:22] if something is of god it should make
[2:13:24] you better it should make you grow more
[2:13:26] like the lord if they got a greater
[2:13:28] revelation they should be more like
[2:13:30] christ is that true
[2:13:32] talk to me tonight if somebody has a
[2:13:34] greater revelation it should show in
[2:13:36] their lives it should show in their
[2:13:38] patience that they should be able to put
[2:13:40] up with you
[2:13:42] if they've got a greater patience and a
[2:13:43] greater love
[2:13:46] if they have a greater revelation than
[2:13:48] the message they ought to live more
[2:13:50] holier
[2:13:51] come on everybody
[2:13:56] but just look at it they they go worse
[2:13:59] they go weird
[2:14:01] they go wild
[2:14:02] do you know what it is friends once god
[2:14:04] reveals himself to you and puts his seed
[2:14:06] into your life if you reject that if you
[2:14:09] say no
[2:14:11] it's souls in prison now
[2:14:13] they can hear the word they can be in an
[2:14:15] atmosphere and not even be moved
[2:14:19] god help us right now where's the
[2:14:21] groaning where's the interest
[2:14:23] for people to really cross the line and
[2:14:26] be birthed
[2:14:38] satan has been tempting you and will
[2:14:40] tempt you more
[2:14:41] but the holy spirit is for you
[2:14:46] and the cry of your heart and the
[2:14:48] travail
[2:14:52] the bible says in romans
[2:14:54] the whole earth is groaning and
[2:14:56] travailing
[2:14:58] for the manifestation of the sons of god

[2:20:00] we're at camp tomorrow thank the lord
[2:20:03] october 31st but
[2:20:05] brother daniel he tasted of this

[2:20:14] like what did that taste like brother
[2:20:17] daniel it's more sour than sweet yeah
[2:20:20] but it's because it came from the motel
[2:20:24] they just get the cheaper ones brother i
[2:20:26] believe that but the only way you you
[2:20:28] believe that wow this is a believer
[2:20:30] brother
[2:20:32] but he tasted and he can tell us what it
[2:20:34] tasted like
[2:20:36] now sister emma can you taste that apple
[2:20:39] please it's not a trick question
[2:20:44] does anybody know what that is what kind
[2:20:46] of apple that is
[2:20:48] granny smith don't talk about her like
[2:20:50] that
[2:20:52] she's a nice person
[2:20:54] ooh sister
[2:20:56] i wasn't talking about you i was talking
[2:20:57] about grandma granny
[2:21:00] okay can you take another bite of that
[2:21:02] and just tell what do you think that
[2:21:04] granny smith tastes like brother daniel
[2:21:07] what do you think that apple tastes like
[2:21:09] i think that one's sour green apples are
[2:21:11] always out ah because you've had
[2:21:12] experience huh you're the apple man
[2:21:15] thank you
[2:21:16] you're welcome brother i have a brother
[2:21:18] daniel oh thank you
[2:21:20] yeah thank you
[2:21:22] so sister emma is really the only person
[2:21:24] in this room that really knows what that
[2:21:27] tastes like what did that taste like
[2:21:29] that tasted sweet
[2:21:33] no i believe you're 100
[2:21:37] but he thought it would be sour because
[2:21:39] all granny smiths are sour right
[2:21:41] but not this one brother daniel
[2:21:45] i worked in produce too most granny
[2:21:47] smiths are sour
[2:21:51] little children that steal stuff at

[2:22:18] piece put it in their mouth begin to
[2:22:19] chew it and swallowed it and finally
[2:22:21] this young man said i want to ask you a
[2:22:24] question
[2:22:26] is this apple sweet or sour
[2:22:29] now he's talking to the infidel that had
[2:22:30] just gotten insane there's no such a
[2:22:32] thing as god
[2:22:34] this message isn't true
[2:22:36] all this about the holy ghost is just
[2:22:38] drama
[2:22:42] and this
[2:22:43] young man took a bite of this apple and
[2:22:46] then he asked the the he said i want to

[2:30:30] shall be saved
[2:30:33] if anyone is desiring the holy spirit
[2:30:35] tonight i would just encourage you to
[2:30:36] receive it
[2:30:38] you don't have to struggle and fight
[2:30:40] just walk into that third room walk over
[2:30:43] there where the angel is just saying
[2:30:44] come on in here don't fight and struggle
[2:30:47] about it just receive ye the holy ghost
[2:30:58] i see a teenage young lady
[2:31:02] before we come into the prayer line
[2:31:05] i see a young lady
[2:31:09] that's been raised in the message also
[2:31:12] actually ministers daughter coming
[2:31:15] through a time of her teenage years
[2:31:19] she's struggling
[2:31:22] doesn't matter what your name is or
[2:31:25] where you live or who your pastor is
[2:31:27] satan will come in those demon spirits
[2:31:31] of depression
[2:31:35] i'm going somewhere with this
[2:31:37] and you talk about the groaning you talk
[2:31:39] about the travail you talk about on your
[2:31:42] bed you talk about when you're alone and
[2:31:44] you're talking about everyone else could
[2:31:46] be happy
[2:31:47] but there's still that spirit hanging
[2:31:49] over you
[2:31:51] and you're never good enough and you're
[2:31:53] always condemned
[2:31:56] and she goes through her teenage years
[2:31:58] and no matter how good the music was
[2:32:02] no matter how good the preaching was
[2:32:06] she was struggling
[2:32:08] in herself and through the awkward times
[2:32:12] of teenage years and
[2:32:16] she becomes so
[2:32:18] struggling with this she begin to cut
[2:32:20] herself
[2:32:24] another young lady that i'm thinking
[2:32:26] about was in high school too and she
[2:32:28] began to cut herself because those
[2:32:31] spirits are wanting to
[2:32:33] take your life and they're also wanting
[2:32:35] to bring attention there's a cry for
[2:32:36] help does anybody hear
[2:32:39] the cry for help
[2:32:41] and we can be right around people that
[2:32:43] are about ready to shatter and break
[2:32:45] apart and not even know it i want to
[2:32:47] stop right here and say god help all of
[2:32:50] us to be more sensitive there could be
[2:32:52] somebody at this camp that is just
[2:32:54] struggling
[2:32:56] even right now battling darkness and
[2:32:58] demons and devils and i hear the
[2:33:00] clanking of chains and this young lady
[2:33:04] was beginning to cut herself and in
[2:33:06] another situation i said we got to get
[2:33:08] her out of that situation we got to get
[2:33:10] her out of there and we got her into a
[2:33:12] church school and she was able to grow
[2:33:14] up in another environment and met her
[2:33:16] husband and tonight she has four
[2:33:18] wonderful boys
[2:33:21] and she loves this message
[2:33:23] can we thank god for bringing her out of
[2:33:25] that marry clay
[2:33:37] and satan would have loved for us to
[2:33:39] have another
[2:33:40] funeral service and another meeting
[2:33:43] like brother john had being raised in
[2:33:45] the branham tabernacle and the deacons
[2:33:48] son
[2:33:49] my best friend
[2:33:51] the deacon son
[2:33:54] and if i said his name most of you would
[2:33:56] know
[2:33:57] his last name
[2:33:59] the pastor's grandson
[2:34:01] i was his best friend being raised up
[2:34:03] and we'd go to his house and we'd have
[2:34:05] great times and we'd be together and as
[2:34:07] he came up into high school
[2:34:09] and he was on the student council he was
[2:34:11] popular and he had a truck and
[2:34:13] everything
[2:34:18] but one day
[2:34:20] and nobody knew
[2:34:22] but he just drove up into an isolated
[2:34:24] place
[2:34:27] and took his life
[2:34:29] and i'll never forget it brother jason
[2:34:31] standing in the graveside there in
[2:34:34] jeffersonville where brother branham is
[2:34:35] also buried and many other people
[2:34:38] and the mother
[2:34:40] here now we're about ready to bury this
[2:34:42] young man's body
[2:34:44] and the mother just wailing
[2:34:47] i never had a chance to say goodbye
[2:34:52] and there were school buses and school
[2:34:54] buses
[2:34:55] from his school he was so popular that
[2:34:57] came to the branham tabernacle
[2:35:00] i never had a chance to say goodbye
[2:35:02] satan took a life in a moment of
[2:35:05] depression and hardship
[2:35:07] i said god save our young people
[2:35:10] deliver them from the lie of the enemy
[2:35:13] i'm here tonight to push back against
[2:35:15] that darkness
[2:35:29] so this young lady she began to cut
[2:35:31] herself and and and satan had just
[2:35:34] brought her to such a deep depression
[2:35:37] and hardship and
[2:35:40] the awkwardness and time through her
[2:35:42] life but i thank god god dealt with
[2:35:45] that young lady's life
[2:35:47] and she had a most wonderful conversion
[2:35:49] god filled her with the holy ghost
[2:35:52] and she's been changed
[2:35:57] and one year
[2:35:58] after that
[2:36:00] she's in a meeting full of hundreds of
[2:36:03] other young people
[2:36:04] just packed out around march or april in
[2:36:07] louisiana
[2:36:08] and people are standing there praise and
[2:36:10] they're
[2:36:11] rejoicing they just want to praise the
[2:36:13] lord they want to worship the lord they
[2:36:15] just want to
[2:36:16] give god praise and glory like you have
[2:36:18] been this weekend and she saw other
[2:36:20] people praising and thanking god but
[2:36:22] because of her past and what she had
[2:36:24] gone through there were scars there were
[2:36:26] scars
[2:36:28] and you you all know in march and april
[2:36:31] there it can get humid and
[2:36:32] she just had on a shirt that was
[2:36:35] a short sleeve shirt she said i'd be so
[2:36:37] embarrassed brother jason i'd be so
[2:36:38] embarrassed to know that i had gone
[2:36:40] through that kind of thing i wouldn't
[2:36:42] want everybody to know
[2:36:44] i would be ashamed
[2:36:46] to know that i had gone so low being
[2:36:48] raised in the message that i wanted to
[2:36:50] take my life i don't want to tell nobody
[2:36:54] but i think sometimes we need to tell
[2:36:57] those around us
[2:36:58] so that others know
[2:37:01] we're not a bunch of angels in this
[2:37:02] building tonight we're sons and
[2:37:04] daughters of god that are groaning under
[2:37:07] travail
[2:37:08] i've got to find you
[2:37:10] where are you
[2:37:18] and she's sitting in the meeting she
[2:37:19] says lord i want to praise you i want to
[2:37:21] glorify your name
[2:37:23] she just passed the point where she said
[2:37:25] i don't care what other people think i'm
[2:37:27] going to stand and praise god anyhow i'm
[2:37:29] going to give god worship i'm going to
[2:37:30] give god praise and she stood up on her
[2:37:32] feet begin to worship the lord and thank
[2:37:35] the lord
[2:37:37] and when she sat down she looked at her
[2:37:39] arm and the scars were gone
[2:37:42] all the scars
[2:37:56] god's able to take the memory able to
[2:37:58] take the scar able to take the issue
[2:38:02] able to take your past
[2:38:04] god's in the delivering business
[2:38:07] god's in the saving business
[2:38:10] can the musicians all come wherever
[2:38:11] you're at can the musicians come
[2:38:14] how many believe what god did for others
[2:38:18] he can do for you
[2:38:20] how many believe what god did for some
[2:38:22] of your fathers and your mothers
[2:38:25] and people that are older
[2:38:27] god can do for you
[2:38:30] i don't think we need to be ashamed you
[2:38:32] older ones
[2:38:33] that we also struggled as youth
[2:38:36] and we don't have the time tonight to
[2:38:38] hear brother john's testimony
[2:38:42] but thank god
[2:38:44] one day the lights came on

[2:38:49] that are 18 or older and say god's done
[2:38:51] a work in my life and i want to give

[2:38:57] any adults want to stand and say god's
[2:38:59] done a work in my life
[2:39:01] to god be praised
[2:39:03] there's nothing to be ashamed of
[2:39:06] we thank you lord
[2:39:07] how many of you that are standing can
[2:39:09] say what he did for me what he did for
[2:39:11] older ones he can do for the rest of
[2:39:13] these

[2:40:03] but god rich in mercy poured himself
[2:40:06] down into a life
[2:40:08] and older ones you don't need to be
[2:40:09] ashamed of your past you can say what
[2:40:12] god did for me he can do for anybody
[2:40:15] else
