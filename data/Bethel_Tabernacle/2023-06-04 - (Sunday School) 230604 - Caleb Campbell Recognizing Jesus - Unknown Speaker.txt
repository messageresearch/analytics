[Music] foreign [Music] [Music] amen Saints good to be in the house of the Lord this morning we just want to stand stand to our feet we're just going to open in some scripture and a word of Prayer we're going to take a little title this morning on recognizing Jesus can actually turn into our Bibles to three portions of scripture so we have Philippians chapter 1 and verse 6 is going to be the first one thankful to be in the house of the Lord this morning amen being confident of this very thing that he which hath begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ we're going to do two more scripture readings here to Second Timothy 4 8. second Timothy 4 8 henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness which the Lord the righteous judge shall give me at that day and not to me only but unto all them also that love his appearing amen and then Luke 24 13 we're going to read just a few scriptures there Luke 24 13 says and now behold two of them went that same day to a village called Emmaus which was from Jerusalem about three score four Longs and they talked together all of these things which had happened and it came to pass that while they come commune together and reasoned Jesus himself Drew near and went with them but their eyes were Holden that they should not know him and in the international version it says that that they did not recognize him so let's just come before the Lord dear precious Heavenly Father Lord we're so grateful and so thankful Lord for the opportunity to come into the house of the Lord this morning Father Lord we're just praying that you would be the one in preeminence today Father we just lift up the name of Jesus we pray that Lord we can take the pressures of life we can take all the the thoughts and all the things Lord God that we have and just lay them aside Lord let your word father just Lord cleanse us this morning Lord let us just get a fresh refilling of your spirit father Lord we love you now we pray for the minister I pray that you would anoint him now Lord God help each one of us to just pull on that word even now in this Sunday school Lord I pray that you just help each one of us to just glean something from you Lord God we love you now we ask all these things in the mighty precious name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen you can take your seats so in the next part of that scripture in verse 17 and he said unto them what manner of communications are these that ye have with one another as ye walked in our sad so Jesus is just imagine putting yourself in these in this in this in these shoes you know the two men talking about the Lord thinking about the Lord thinking upon these things of the Lord and Jesus himself comes before them and says why are you sad what's going on and one of them says whose name was cleopas answered said unto them art thou a stranger in Jerusalem and hast thou not known the things which are come to pass and there in these days any testifying about the Lord to the Lord and he said unto them what things and they said unto him concerning Jesus of Nazareth which was a prophet Mighty indeed and word before God and all the people and how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him to be condemned to death and had crucified him but we trusted that it had been he which should have redeemed Israel and besides this today is the third day since these things were done yea and the certain woman and the certain woman also of our company made us astonished which were early at the Sepulcher and when they found not his body they came saying that they had also seen a vision of angels which said that he was alive and certain of them which were with us went to the sepuler and found it even so as the woman had said but him they saw not then he said to them o fools and slow of heart to believe that all the prophets have spoken ought not Christ to have suffered these things and entered into his glory and beginning at Moses and all the prophets he expounded unto them all the scriptures the things concerning himself and they drew an eye onto the village whether they went and he made as though he would have gone further so he was going to just keep going but they constrained him and said abide with us for it is towards evening and the day is far spent and he went into tarry with them and it came to pass as he sat meat with him he took bread and blessed it and break it and gave to them and their eyes were open for they knew him and he vanished out of their sight brother Branham picks this up here in looking unto Jesus and he says oh we notice the disciples uh paragraph 44 we noticed the disciples one time after it was Easter morning what a morning Jesus up from the dead walking among the followers and two friends cleopas and one of his friends was on the road to Emmaus and they were talking along grieved in their heart and a man stepped out of the Bush and walked with him the rest of the day talking to them about Christ and that evening they asked him and he was like he was going to pass them by but they asked him to come in and he did so Saints how many times in our hearts have we been longing to see Jesus and he what we have to invite him into our hearts and we have to invite him into ourselves he's not gonna he's not gonna put a thumb on us and and force us to do anything he's a gentleman so he wants us to open up our hearts to receive him amen and when you're looking for Jesus brother random takes this and when you're looking for Jesus you're gonna find him amen and uh when cleopas and his friends were on this road they were grieved and they did something but he did something there so they had actually seen Jesus and they'd seen the the things that he had been they'd seen his his uh you know he was a he was a man you know he was God but he was a man and so they saw the things that he did and they saw the ways that he walked and they saw the ways that he talked and so they recognized there was something about him that day that they had recognized that this is Jesus this is the same man this is the same person I've seen this happen and only one person that I've seen it happen before and then it was at that time that they recognized that Jesus was literally walking with them all that day can you just imagine that searching the scriptures brother Branham says and the Pharisees had a word drawed out just exactly the way that Messiah was coming so brother random comes and picks this up and says you know imagine then on the other coin of things when you know they had the scriptures as Pharisees they they had Moses's law they had all these things that they held on to and they were looking for a messiah to come they were looking for that they were all looking for the same thing but when they were when he was standing when when God in flesh was standing right before them he they could not recognize him so when you when it comes time to recognize Jesus you sometimes you're looking at the simple things of life God always reveals himself in Simplicity we have to remember that God always reveals himself in Simplicity amen and he said in um and looking unto Jesus he said Moses said the Lord your God shall raise up a prophet like unto me a lawgiver and so forth a prophet and him the people shall hear and if they had known Moses's writing they would have known him they thought they knowed Moses's writing but you see they didn't know it they were blinded to the very facts so just a few words from him what did they do they sprang up and said this man's got a devil devil come to teach us what school did he come from we have no record of him wonder whose Fellowship card he is packing or something on that order or that question but they failed to look and to see the very God that had promised the word was vindicating it right there through that person of Jesus Christ God's God's word produces the sunshine God produces the Earth God's word produces the air everything is the word of God made manifest everything that's got a reality to it some looked and saw and brother Matt brought this up in a in a sermon Brother Brad brought it up too when when different times in the scripture when different prophets and different men of God saw God and how they what did they see you know Isaiah Isaiah brother Brandon picked it up and and um Isaiah was said I see counselor Prince of Peace Mighty God Daniel saw him and I saw a stone hewed out of a mountain and brother brother Matt dramatized that so well that day and I I uh I think it was Ezekiel the wheel in the middle of the wheel and just seeing God and seeing seeing him in his different ways and and and recognizing who he was and then brother random comes and looks at the other coin looks at the other side of the coin and Nebuchadnezzar says one day had done an evil thing he threw three believing children into a fiery furnace and when he opened the door to see how they were getting along in there he saw the fourth man on the inside of the firmness and what did you see when you looked Nebuchadnezzar he said he looked like the Son of God that's what he saw when he looked into a crime that he had done that there was one that looked like the Son of God so what what side of the coin are we going to be on are we going to be on the side where we're looking for Jesus and we see the Prince of Peace we see the the Mighty the Mighty God in our lives through this message of the hour are we looking to Jesus and are we recognizing him or are we are we the nebuchadnezzars who were we we see him from afar off but it's not he's not with us he's not we're he's not recognized in our life John the greatest of all the prophets he was the one in the introduced Jesus Jesus said he was greater than any man that had ever been born you know and I was thinking the other day about the two Johns in the Bible John the Baptist and and John the disciple and you know likened unto uh you know the scripture talks so so greatly about John the Baptist one of the greatest men That Ever Walked the face of the Earth and God comes in flesh form and asks John the Baptist to baptize him because scripture had to be fulfilled that way John the disciple you know a man who laid in the bosom of Jesus me and me and my wife were just reading the scripture last night and several times when you read the book of John John refers to himself as the one whom Jesus loved amen and you see that and you you then you see how at at the culmination of his ministry Jesus's Ministry he comes and he sees John and he humbles himself and he washes his feet the god of the world in Simplicity washing John's feet can you imagine the position you can you imagine how little they felt God himself is literally washing my feet imagine imagine how little you would feel but that's what it takes to see God you recognize the littleness of yourself and the littleness of of what you are but then you see that even though I'm so little and even though I'm so nothing God still wants to have a relationship with me he still wants to wash my feet he still wants to to commune with me and then he gives me eyes to see and gives me eyes to recognize him through his ministry through the message of the hour amen it's such a beautiful thing and um you know we have I'm going to go through some quotes here so just this is just a little bit of a last minute uh a last minute study here so forgive me I didn't have any time to put anything up but we're going to go through some scriptures and some quotes here and if you any anybody wants those I can send them over but um the one John 24 or John chapter 21 4-7 but when the morning was come now Jesus stood on the shore and the disciples knew not that it was Jesus so this is another instance where where they hadn't recognized him yet and then Jesus saith unto him children have ye any meat and they answered and said no so he said unto them cast the net on the right side of the ship and ye shall find they cat so they cast therefore and now they were not able to draw it for the multitude of fish therefore that disciple whom Jesus loved imagine the disciple whom Jesus loved John saith unto Peter it is the Lord now when Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord he gird his Fisher's coat upon him for he was naked and he did cast himself into the sea and I I just was thinking back on on um a study I did not long ago on Peter at this time and this was the first time that Peter had actually seen Jesus after he had been resurrected after he had denied him three times and so can you imagine how Peter wanted to get to Jesus I said oh lord for you know I I I'm I'm can you imagine being like that we've all been in that state we've all been you know we've all fallen short of the glory of God and then to for God to to reach out his net and say listen there's there's I know you you messed up but just come come back unto me and and that's what that whole entire experience in that next couple of verses was about when you know God said to Peter you know uh do you love me Peter yes God you know that I loved you it's such a such a beautiful thing and then at Matthew 17 1-5 says and after six days taketh Peter James and John and his brother and bringeth him into a high mountain so this was when the mount Transfiguration and he was transfigured before him and his face did shine as the sun and his Remnant was white as the light and behold there appeared unto him Moses and Elias walking with him then answered Peter and said unto him Jesus Lord it is good for us to be here if thou Wilt let us make three Tabernacles one for three one for Moses and one for Elias while he yet spake Behold a bright Cloud overshadowed them and behold a voice out of the cloud which said this is my beloved Son and whom I am well pleased hear ye him and um I can't remember this scripture here but kind of talking about this morning I brother Matt had asked me to to do this Sunday school and the Lord had brought this out of my heart just this morning just listening to the prophet on in the car talking about getting into the land of adoption brother the scripture says according he hath chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy Without Blame before him in love having predestinated predestinated us under the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the Good Will of his pleasure so in this the message what was the Holy Ghost given for in 1959 let me stop here brother Branham goes and starts to explain what that land of adoption was in the Old Testament how you know you were born into you know you were I'll just read what brother Banner says he explains it so well the next thing happened there came a birth into that home now when the Holy Spirit see another Spirit came in which was a son that son he was not in full charge neither was he Heir until he got to a certain age and he proved and he had to be proved first yes and they that had the law of adoption to you ministers the place English son is what I'm speaking on see when he came to a place where he was adopted and Jesus gave a beautiful illustration of it on the mount Transfiguration there we just read and brother Benham says as I said God will never go outside of his laws to do anything if you got an Artesian well and brother random just starts to dramatize the story if you have an Artesian well on this hill blowing all the water over there on the air and on this other Hill over here you've got a crop burning up you can stand on this hill and holler oh water run over here and fill my crop oh water get to my crop and it'll never do that but if you work according to the law of gravitation you can water that crop if you put the crop here and the hill brings the water down naturally so you have a sick man laying here or a sinner laying here or a man that wants to be right can't give up drinking can't give up smoking can't give up lust and things if you'll just work according to the laws of God and let the Holy Spirit come in here then he's no more of his own he will stop that thing because the Holy Spirit takes him over but you've got to work according to the law of God the rules of God now in the Old Testament now this is the explanation now in the Old Testament when the baby was born they watched it to see how it behaved the only way that you can say that Jesus is the Christ is it when the Holy Ghost comes into you and Bears record and witness itself out and says he is the Son of God that's the only way that you know the resurrection is when the Holy Ghost Bears record when he comes the Holy Ghost has come he will testify of me and show you things to come and bring out these things he said to your memories you'll never find it in the school but he'll bring things to your memories and brother brother Branham references John 14 12 verily verily I say unto you he that believeth on me the works that I do who shall he do and also greater which in the right translation here and brother Brennan brings that out many times is actually more if you want to look it up Greater Works more works because I go unto the father so if he went into the Father the Holy Ghost would come is that right another scripture said if I go not away the comforter will not come but if I go away I'll come again and be with you even in you see it's God with you over you first with you in Christ in you in the Holy Ghost it's God in you amen so brother Branham goes on to say then the father being a businessman by this time maybe in his 40s or his 50s he didn't have the time to P to teach the baby himself so in them days they didn't have public schools that they have so they got what they called a tutor or a school teacher and the school teacher was the best that he could find so that he could be truthful to tell what the father was the truth um to tell the Father the truth about it and when this boy got to a certain age say he was matured if that boy was just a renegade no no good didn't care for the father's business all he thought about was flirting and running with woman and drinking and gambling or horse racing that boy would always be a son but he was never placed into position to have air of all that the father had right so he but if he was a good boy and he was about the father's business and he proved to be the right child then they had the ceremony they took the boy into the street and put a white robe on him and they set him on a scaffold so that all the city could see they made a feast in a jubilee and the father then had the ceremony of adoption he adopted his own son into his own business and then the son was co-equal with the father in other words if it had been today then son's name was on the check just as good as the daddies now watch what God did when the son was born he let him go this is so beautiful he let him go for 30 years testing him and trying him then he gave him three years of a harder trial this is Jesus's Ministry and then at the end of that hard trial when you see that his son was about the father's business we see Mount Transfiguration Book of Luke he took Peter James and John the three Witnesses took him on the top of the mountain and there God performed the law of adoption he took up as they seen Jesus close shine white as lightning and as a cloud overshadow him and a voice came out of the cloud and said this is my beloved Son hear ye him my goodness I'll sit down now and have no more to say what he says is Law and Truth what a beautiful what a beautiful story and what a beautiful way that he brings it out because even you know Jesus was always going to have that he was all he was he was he was Christ in a man but he had to go through those testings and then when he did when he came to the end of his ministry God God came and he said hear ye him this is my beloved Son and each one of us have to step into that land of adoption each one of us has to come to those time trying times in our own life and in our own walk with the Lord where we have to make a choice God only calls you you don't you don't come to God unless he calls you so you know the work started God's gonna start the work and he's going to finish the work but there is a little bit of brother random said that I think in choosing of the Bride there is a little bit that we have to do there is something that we have to do and that is we have to we have to take up the cross and follow him and we have to lay aside all those weights that so easily beset us and we have to uh come and and come into that land and recognize that this is this is Jesus recognize this message that this is Jesus trying to unveil himself through through uh through the Holy Ghost in This final age to each one of us that is what the message of the hour is it's Christ unveiled through a bride at the final day to give us what we need to get into a Rapture amen so it's such a beautiful thing now the church has come through schools she married back a long time ago became a denomination in an organization and the birth produced something else and it's got to a place where the Pentecostal church and the New Birth has been tested and tried and now it come to a place and God doesn't deal with churches as an organization he doesn't deal with groups of people he deals with individuals and that's that's that's no that's no secret you know even in this church you know you come to a message church and but I think I don't know if I have it in this quote or not but brother Benham comes to say I mean even even the devil believes the message he believes that it's true he knows that it's true so you could be born into a message Church you could come all your entire life and you could sit under the ministry of the most incredible Ministry and yet you still have never come into your laminate a land of adoption yet because it's a placing and it's there has to come to a Time where that he draws you and you come unto him and then you lay aside everything you lay aside all of it and then God is able to give you the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen that is what that is some holy spirit that say the lutherans that Sanctified the methodists that baptized the Pentecostal is Now setting an order the coming of the Lord Jesus when it will be so powerful that body will come into a group of church that will draw the rest of them from the grave they'll be a resurrection that's what the Holy Ghost is for brother random says in what was the Holy Ghost given for that's what the Holy Ghost is for what is the Holy Ghost without us they cannot be made perfect they lived in one day under that we live in another day and when the enemy comes in like a flood the spirit of God will rise up a standard against it and the enemy has come in like a flood in this last day but guess what the spirit of the Lord Jesus has raised up a standard against him that standard is this message amen and it's such a beautiful thing what is it he's pouring in his Spirit those who are resting out yonder in the grave or under the altar as the scripture says how long Lord how much longer God is waiting listen to this this is powerful brother Benham says God is waiting on you and me and brother Donnie brought that out I think and when he was here in his meetings and you know we can keep going to church and we can keep doing this thing until that last predestinated seed comes into their land of adoption receives the Holy Ghost and then we can be going into a Rapture because he will not lose one he will not lose one he brother Benham says he is waiting on me and you amen wow the church is waiting on you and me adoption time when he can pour into his pour into us his fullness his power his resurrection and then when the church and Christ becomes so close together till Christ becomes visible Among Us and raises the dead and then we go into a Rapture praise the Lord now we're going to say that after a while for those who are filled with the Holy Ghost that goes into the Rapture for the rest of the day said live not for a space of a thousand years and um we're just going to go down here a little bit just have just have a few more minutes here but the the heart of my thought is from the beginning of the scripture bringing everything down to a simplistic scripture of recognizing Jesus and doing it not so much in just the the day and hour that you live in but doing it in the walk with Jesus that you personally have each and every day and and being confident of the very thing Philippians says that that which he hath begun in you that which hath he begun in you will he perform it until the day of Jesus Christ there is a work that God started in you and then there is a work that God will finish in you but there is there is things that we have to do we have to lay aside those things and and I've been going through the seals just by myself here the last few weeks and God brother Brenham starts everything with just the Simplicity God God hides and reveals himself in Simplicity and you go through all that and he keeps pointing back to that and that's what he keeps pointing pointing back to in the scriptures when the Pharisees it's just all about the Simplicity of walking a hidden life in Jesus Christ laying aside those things and when you come through that come through that door it's just you and the Lord Jesus Christ and him and you allowing him to reflect you just a little bit more each and every day amen so that that work that he began in you he can also finish in you amen it's really just such a beautiful representation and going through that and so that when you know when we have our walk to Emmaus and when we're testifying you know we're testifying to the Lord and what he's doing in our life and what he has done in our life and you know unbeknownst to us Jesus is walking with us you know and that's what he is he's walking with us every day of our life he is there with you he's there with you in the hospital room he's there with you in your car he's there with you at your job he's there with you if you have received that Holy Ghost that message for your day and if you have accepted it and you have pressed on into it so let's just stand to our feet this morning it's power hearts Heavenly Father Lord we're so grateful and so thankful Lord for the word Lord we pray that it would be a blessing father and we pray that Lord Lord all the the scriptures and the quotes and it just seems chopped up but father we pray that we can just take it home with us Lord and that we can just ponder it on ponder it throughout the day and throughout the week and Lord let it just change us a little bit more Lord God into your likeness into your image father God help each one of us Lord and if there may be one Among Us Lord maybe listening in that Lord maybe hasn't father God committed everything to you Lord let it just be that time that they do that father we love you now we pray for the ministry we pray that you'd anoint him I pray that you'd help him just step aside and just give us a word this morning well father we love you and we ask all these things now in the lovely name of Jesus Christ amen God bless y'all foreign foreign yeah
