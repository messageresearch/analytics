[26:04] and the building project and um some
[26:07] fundraising ideas um so just a quick
[26:11] little update on you know um the prices
[26:15] and the costs and all that stuff and the
[26:17] brothers are working on putting together
[26:20] a spreadsheet with the you know line
[26:23] items listed of a cost of every phase of
[26:26] the project how it's broke down so that
[26:29] everyone can see where every dollar is
[26:31] allocated for this project um basically
[26:36] um we've already finished phase one and
[26:37] we've began phase two so phase one um
[26:41] was giving a facelift to the existing
[26:43] church here putting new siding new
[26:46] windows a paint new door um different
[26:49] things that we've done in here in this
[26:52] in the church already and on the outside
[26:55] um it also included phase one also Al
[26:58] included um the design we didn't pay for
[27:02] the design because brother Steve gifted
[27:04] that to the Lord and to the church but
[27:07] um the uh the blueprints the cost of the
[27:10] architect the permitting etc etc those
[27:14] costs all equal roughly about
[27:19] $60,000 um that has been paid for um
[27:22] phase two started with the the the land
[27:26] prep behind and on the sides
[27:28] um and then the pouring of the slab and
[27:31] um that was the kickoff of phase two the
[27:35] pouring of the slab and all the work
[27:36] we've done so far on phase two um is
[27:40] roughly $40,000 that we've spent so up
[27:44] to date we've spent roughly about
[27:46] $100,000 on the
[27:48] project um now the next part of phase
[27:52] two is the dryin the build and the dry
[27:55] in of the structure um that
[27:58] estimate is R roughly around
[28:01] $80,000 um those that's a very rough
[28:04] estimate so uh brother Matt and brother
[28:06] Tony are going to work on pricing the
[28:08] remainder of that out that doesn't
[28:10] include like the furniture inside the
[28:13] decor any of that stuff that's just
[28:15] getting the structure up and getting it
[28:18] like watertight um uh so as brother Tony
[28:23] and brother Matt are working hopefully
[28:25] in the next few weeks we'll we'll have
[28:27] that line item pricing um and so what
[28:30] we'll see um will be you know if our
[28:35] estimates were close or not you'll get a
[28:37] full view of that and um so the total
[28:41] price the total cost
[28:44] for um the phase one and phase two
[28:48] should roughly be around
[28:50] $180,000 mind you we've already paid a
[28:54] 100,000 okay so we have some work to do
[28:57] to get to the next phase brother Jason
[29:00] doesn't want to kick it off kick off
[29:03] like the build until we have the 880,000
[29:05] or their abouts ready so that we can pay
[29:09] for it to be fully enclosed and dried in
[29:12] which makes sense because we don't want
[29:13] to put up you know start building with
[29:16] stick and and then we can't close it in
[29:18] because then the weather will you know
[29:20] the weather will damage the materials
[29:22] that we've paid for so um that being
[29:26] said when the liite when when we get a
[29:28] spreadsheet with all the line items
[29:30] we'll put it up here on the board and
[29:32] we'll give you some we'll go through
[29:34] some of the line items and you know for
[29:36] example we may have like the window
[29:40] package um line item line item 10 is the
[29:43] window package total cost
[29:46] $5,000 so when you see that amount you
[29:49] could say hey I want to sponsor that or
[29:54] me and you know brother Matthew we we're
[29:57] going to SP sponsor that $5,000 or
[30:00] whoever um it could be you know line
[30:03] item 25 I'm going to I'm going to buy
[30:05] all the plastic to wrap the inside of
[30:08] the building that's $3,000 I'm going to
[30:10] pledge I'm going to sponsor that that
[30:12] portion whatever that is the drywall the
[30:15] wood
[30:15] package um whatever those costs are
[30:18] you'll be able to see them you'll get a
[30:20] good view of what they are and then
[30:22] you'll be able to like take ownership
[30:25] for one of those line items if you so
[30:27] choose if you feel led um there'll be a
[30:30] lot of line items so Plumbing electric
[30:32] paint roof all of it um and again uh I
[30:37] just want to thank everyone for their
[30:39] giving so far and all the work that's
[30:41] been done um there has been a lot of
[30:44] work going on in the background that a
[30:46] lot of us don't see um with planning and
[30:49] so forth and digging and you know
[30:51] corresponding with contractors and so
[30:54] forth a lot of stuff um has been pledged
[30:58] there has been some not a lot but some
[31:00] some stuff have been pledged as far as
[31:03] materials um and for free that are going
[31:06] to be gifts to the Lord and to the
[31:08] church um time and material um both a
[31:12] lot of those things are being gifted to
[31:14] the church so I thank God for that but
[31:18] we have a lot of work to do Saints if
[31:20] we're serious about making room and we
[31:22] see what God's doing and bringing more
[31:24] families in and so forth we we going to
[31:28] need this room you know I think that the
[31:30] time is short and um we don't know what
[31:34] what other people the Lord is going to
[31:36] bring into our Lighthouse here but we
[31:38] want to make sure that there's room for
[31:39] them when they come can you say amen
[31:42] amen all right so um we want to bring up
[31:46] brother Brad Campbell come on up brother
[31:48] Brad we have he's he had a great um
[31:51] fundraising idea so we want to let him
[31:54] bring it before the church and explain
[31:56] how it all works and maybe even like how
[31:58] the Lord showed him um about this amen
[32:02] let's give Brother Brad a
[32:03] [Applause]
[32:08] hand God bless you

[32:22] camera can you do me a favor so I want
[32:25] this to be three things impactful I want

[32:30] be
[32:31] inspiring and I'd like to get everyone's
[32:33] attention even you CH children the kids
[32:36] all of you so in order to do that I'm
[32:38] going to get your attention good morning
[32:40] brother God bless you how you doing this
[32:42] morning you want to be a part of the
[32:44] building fund and of everything even the
[32:47] young people right okay well I have an
[32:50] idea I'm going to confess something to
[32:52] y'all
[32:53] because what happened with me was when
[32:56] when I found out we were doing this
[32:58] I'm like Lord and this is just the human
[33:00] side when when I found out we're were
[33:02] going to do this I remember going way
[33:04] back and looking at a building that we
[33:05] were going to purchase it was going to
[33:06] be several
[33:08] hundred, I thought oh my soul we're all
[33:12] just simple working people none of us
[33:14] have millions of dollars that I'm aware
[33:17] of we all work hard for our money right
[33:19] we all work hard to pay our bills every
[33:21] one of us do am I right we all struggle
[33:25] every one of us struggles so I prayed
[33:28] and prayed and prayed about this
[33:29] building fund and I'm not kidding you
[33:31] before I even donated I prayed for six
[33:34] months because it struck me in such a
[33:38] way that was so
[33:40] impactful and
[33:42] Unforgettable to me personally I thought
[33:46] Lord how am I ever going to be able to
[33:48] help with a building out back how am I
[33:51] going to do that I have no idea how I'm
[33:53] going to do that I already pay my ties
[33:56] or I try to try my best
[33:58] at the age I'm at with a Christian I try
[34:00] to pay my ties first hases anybody ever
[34:03] struggle with that you got bills that
[34:04] need paid you don't have enough but
[34:07] you're contemplating as a human do I pay
[34:08] my bills do I pay my ties and figure out
[34:10] how to pay my bills I remember that but
[34:13] I'm at the stage in my life where I can
[34:15] pay my ties first and then I pay my
[34:17] bills and and and then you know there's
[34:20] alms there's giving I don't know how you
[34:23] guys are as Christians but I know what I
[34:25] do as a Christian is I do simple things
[34:28] when I have an extra $5 in my pocket
[34:31] there's a guy in town you've all
[34:32] probably seen him he rides around on a
[34:34] bike like this right with his hands he
[34:35] can't move I always stop and give him
[34:38] money and I try to help people a lot of
[34:40] times I I've stopped at the bridges and
[34:43] you know homeless people are sleeping
[34:45] you you take your best expensive winter
[34:47] coat and you go lay it on them and you
[34:49] leave while they're sleeping I don't
[34:51] know if you guys are doing those things
[34:53] if you're not please start doing those
[34:55] things that's the kind of stuff we're
[34:57] supposed to doing as a Christian if
[34:59] you're not doing those things then I'm
[35:03] just telling you I want to encourage you
[35:04] to do them so I would like you all to
[35:07] just stand up with me real quick just
[35:09] stand up everybody please stand up now
[35:12] turn around everybody just turn all the
[35:14] way around don't turn all the way around
[35:16] and sit back down okay now I got your
[35:19] attention 100%
[35:21] okay so I've only got like three minutes
[35:25] so I don't have a lot of time left but
[35:28] what I wanted to do was share just a
[35:29] couple quick notes so after this six
[35:32] months I finally went to Brother kin and
[35:34] I said where'd he go Kenny okay I I said
[35:37] I got this great idea the lord gave me
[35:38] some inspiration and I shared it with
[35:40] him and then nothing ever happened I
[35:43] never took action and then about three
[35:45] weeks later a month later however much
[35:47] time passed I went out and shared my
[35:49] idea with um with brother Matt Watkins
[35:53] and uh while we were talking I don't
[35:56] want to take credit because it was
[35:59] actually as much his idea as at mine
[36:01] anybody see that model when you first
[36:04] came into church that's a finished
[36:06] product of what this building is
[36:07] supposed to look like when we're
[36:09] done so my point is when I prayed and
[36:12] prayed and prayed the the term that came
[36:15] to mind was compound interest and the
[36:18] Lord kept saying that to me compound
[36:20] interest well I understand the concept
[36:22] that's how investment bankers work they
[36:24] take all your money right they put it in
[36:27] escro account and they make money off of
[36:29] that and and that's how they make their
[36:31] money and then they give you some of the
[36:34] percentage or whatnot but that was the
[36:36] term compound interest so here's the
[36:40] thing let me just ask a question brother
[36:42] Mike Vel when you're out working on the
[36:44] job and you're sweating to death man you
[36:46] get in the car and you go to a gas
[36:47] station and you buy a couple cold drinks
[36:49] and a snack right we all do that when
[36:52] you're working on the job you that are
[36:53] Gideon when you go out HVAC and you're
[36:56] doing stuff you stop and you buy a soda
[36:58] how much is that soda $2 at least
[37:02] $2.50 we all do it every one of us does
[37:05] that frivolously with ourselves with our
[37:07] own money well here's the thing I'm
[37:11] about ready to do something I'm going to
[37:13] give this to Pastor in just a minute I'm
[37:15] going to do something that has never
[37:17] ever been done in a church before ever I
[37:21] promise you what you're about to see has
[37:24] never been done in a church and I wanted
[37:27] I just prayed Lord please my the
[37:30] inspiration that you gave me help me to
[37:32] convey this to the congregation so they
[37:35] all can be a part don't let me ask you a
[37:39] question don't you all in five years
[37:41] want to sit in that new building and
[37:42] look around and think to yourself I was
[37:44] a part of this I gave to this I
[37:49] sacrificed this little thing a week I
[37:52] sacrifice this I maybe I bought this
[37:55] chair I just even the children
[37:58] so the idea that came are these two
[38:00] things compound interest and here's how
[38:02] this works very simple I started doing
[38:05] this I don't know Pastor can tell you
[38:07] when I don't even remember it's been a
[38:08] few weeks but I put cash in an envelope
[38:12] every single time I walk in that door
[38:15] every time whether it's a dime a quarter
[38:19] $2
[38:21] $10 I always try my best to have a
[38:25] little bit of cash in my my pocket
[38:28] because when I'm in a gas station I
[38:29] don't think twice about buying myself a
[38:31] drink not even twice I just buy it and
[38:34] so if you sacrifice that one just one
[38:36] time just sacrifice going and getting a
[38:38] drink oh I'm going to keep this two
[38:40] bucks every time you come in that door
[38:43] to church on Wednesday and Sunday if you
[38:45] would just put whatever you have in your
[38:47] pocket a dollar even if it's a dollar
[38:50] doesn't matter do the math a dollar from
[38:51] everyone in here every time compound
[38:54] interest we will have enough money to
[38:57] pay not only for the building for all of
[38:59] its contents we'll even be able to pay
[39:01] for phase three and and do the inside of
[39:03] this roof and everything it'll happen so
[39:05] fast it'll make your head spin God can
[39:08] do that if we are all apart so that was
[39:11] part one of what I prayed about for six
[39:14] months and I thought wow Lord that
[39:15] actually can work so I started doing it
[39:18] myself and I told pastor about it I told
[39:20] Brother Matt and then the second part
[39:23] was I knew somebody that did these
[39:26] models one of my clients Architects they
[39:28] put these models together and you know
[39:31] Matt and I talked about it and I think
[39:32] it was even Matt Watkins idea to
[39:34] actually make that into a bank I don't
[39:36] remember our discussion very well but so
[39:39] that's a bank that building has a slot
[39:41] in the top of it okay that's to do
[39:45] something real simple when you come in
[39:47] here I don't care if it's a quarter even
[39:50] if you only bring a quarter a simple
[39:54] single little quarter try to bring
[39:56] something I don't care if it's pennies
[39:58] you little kids you young people if you
[40:01] find a dime or a quarter laying around
[40:04] pick it up put it in your pocket with
[40:06] the intentions next time you come to
[40:07] church put it in that building we will
[40:10] have this building fund paid for in no
[40:12] time if that simple concept those two
[40:17] things will pay for everything I promise
[40:20] you it's that simple so I don't have
[40:23] much time left so I'm going to read a
[40:26] scripture and we're going to do one
[40:28] thing and then I know y'all want to hear
[40:30] the word are y'all hungry this morning
[40:31] for the word amen I don't know about
[40:34] y'all but the most important thing to me
[40:37] in my life is what is actually on my
[40:41] Epitaph bation is always talking about
[40:43] this life is not about your life but
[40:46] it's about the life to come and once you
[40:49] get that you're like you realize wow
[40:52] okay so it's about the life to come so
[40:54] you're supposed to be building up riches
[40:56] up there not here right and so I'm going
[40:59] to read a scripture that's not going to
[41:00] make any sense to you why I'm reading
[41:02] this particular scripture about this
[41:04] subject but I'm going to read it in
[41:07] Proverbs 22 it says a good name is
[41:09] rather to be chosen than great riches
[41:13] and loving favor rather than silver or
[41:18] gold I read that scripture for this
[41:20] reason names were on my brain this
[41:22] morning for various reasons doesn't
[41:24] matter but I told my wife I'm like you
[41:26] know what I've always thought that
[41:27] scripture was mostly about what you name
[41:30] someone and what your actual name is
[41:32] right that's why I've always thought
[41:33] that and then I was like the Lord
[41:35] actually gave me a little tiny nugget
[41:36] and he's like no it's not just about the
[41:39] name that you have and that you are it's
[41:42] about the end of your life what's on
[41:46] your gravestone what's on your Epitaph
[41:49] the end of your life what kind of a
[41:52] testimony did you have your name for you
[41:56] with this flesh that the Associated what
[41:58] testimony will you have at the end of
[42:00] your life will you have a good name will
[42:02] people remember you for all the good
[42:05] things that you have done have you tried
[42:07] to live a Christian Life have you given
[42:10] and I'm talking about giv I don't talk
[42:11] about your family we all want to help
[42:13] each other I'm talking about people you
[42:15] don't know will you have a good name so
[42:18] we're going to do this thing you've
[42:19] never seen this done in a church I
[42:21] promise you it's never one time ever
[42:23] occurred in any church anywhere brother
[42:25] Luther come on up here
[42:31] this is a basket he has one in
[42:36] hand I'm going to put money in a
[42:40] basket I'm going to put a whole bunch of
[42:43] change in a
[42:47] basket but Luther is going to pass this
[42:50] money out and you're all are going to
[42:53] take some every one of you are going to
[42:55] take some all right
[42:58] never been done in church ever one time
[43:00] offering here I'll dump this in your
[43:02] basket there you go now you can sort
[43:04] those mix all those up there you go I'm
[43:07] not going to say how much it is it
[43:08] doesn't matter brother please just pass
[43:09] it around make sure everyone grabs
[43:13] something grab a quarter grab and until
[43:15] it's all gone just pass it around
[43:17] everybody grab some money because what I
[43:19] want you to do with that money and some
[43:21] of you may even forget at the end of the
[43:23] service you don't have to get up now but
[43:24] at the end of the service I want you to
[43:26] take that money if it's on your heart
[43:28] you can keep it if you want doesn't
[43:29] matter to me I freely gave it but it it
[43:33] should go in that building fund building
[43:37] in the back back there now I want the
[43:39] kids to take it too okay because this
[43:43] can even be part of the kids the little
[43:45] ones even the young people brother you
[43:48] can sit in that new building and vision
[43:50] yourself in our new building finished
[43:53] saying I was a part of this I actually
[43:55] gave some of my own own funds to help
[43:58] this building fund two words y'all
[44:01] compound interest if you don't
[44:04] understand the concept go look up
[44:05] exponential growth it grows like this
[44:08] real fast in a year if we all do this
[44:13] this simple thing this is only $3 that's
[44:15] how much extra cash I had in my pocket
[44:18] that's my giving today it says building
[44:20] fund on it and it says my name well do
[44:23] the math somebody get out of calculator
[44:25] if they want Count how many people times
[44:28] $3 how much money goes into that towards
[44:31] our building fund if we do that eight
[44:33] times a month right there's usually four
[44:36] Wednesdays and four Sundays in a month
[44:39] we're going to have this building fund
[44:41] and none of us are going to be so
[44:42] burdened that when we get our tax
[44:45] returns and you know sometimes you can't
[44:47] discern between the Holy Spirit talking
[44:49] to you and your own human Spirit talking
[44:50] to you and you're like man do
[44:53] I fund or do I give this this much you
[44:58] don't have to do that you can if you
[45:00] want to I'm just showing you the Lord
[45:02] inspired me to get over my own self of
[45:05] how I personally am going to still be
[45:08] able to pay my ties pay all my bills
[45:10] live give alms still do the other giving
[45:14] that I try to do and now a building fund

[49:49] really really wonderful greet all the
[49:51] visitors today we got a couple of prayer
[49:53] requests we're going to take up here in
[49:55] just a moment but I just wanted to uh
[49:58] say concerning all of the worship and
[50:02] the singing and the special singing and
[50:05] those missionary reports amen so I would
[50:08] like to say my name is Jason Watkins and
[50:10] I Endor endorse those everything you
[50:14] heard amen praise the Lord so we're glad
[50:17] to be um at this next stage you can see
[50:20] I'm sure you saw the model that was also
[50:22] um something Brother Brad pitched to me
[50:24] I thought it was Capital idea one of the
[50:27] best I'd ever heard and I didn't know
[50:29] you could build them um so cheaply and
[50:32] it's it was 3D uh print printed and then
[50:35] decorated so uh the only thing is that
[50:38] um we do have execution orders if Little
[50:40] Fingers happen to get get up there so
[50:44] moms if you don't want to lose your
[50:46] children brother Luther's under strict
[50:49] orders amen praise the Lord now
[50:52] everybody knows he won't do it CU all
[50:53] these little kids somehow love brother
[50:55] Luther I don't get it but they do
[50:58] they're not afraid of him they're just
[50:59] like you know the the ex Mafia Hitman
[51:02] thing doesn't affect them at all so
[51:05] we're happy amen for that but please try
[51:08] to be extra vigilant to keep little
[51:10] fingers who will just have a hard time
[51:12] resisting all those little trees things
[51:14] and little flowers amen so but I I when
[51:17] I looked at that I was I was stunned at
[51:19] what it could look like and so you know
[51:22] I think we have a good program going now
[51:24] just because we have a piggy bank that
[51:26] don't mean you can't still give
[51:27] abundantly beyond what you can your
[51:29] change I appreciate brother Brad's idea
[51:32] and I I will say that because of um
[51:37] because of who I'm married to Brother
[51:38] Brad I'm actually not even allowed to
[51:40] think once about getting a soda when I
[51:42] go into a store
[51:46] amen and by the way it's it's dbby y
[51:51] that's coming we all know Sister Debbie
[51:54] is a hurricane of sorts but she's not
[51:57] that tropical storm amen praise the Lord
[52:02] amen so we we we're I don't know we'll
[52:05] we'll see how that the lord always
[52:06] watches out for us keeps us safe so
[52:09] we're not going to worry about that too
[52:10] much amen looks like we'll have mostly
[52:12] some rain that'll be coming in so I'm
[52:15] looking forward to as brother Ken
[52:18] mentioned we've got the idea of line
[52:21] item
[52:22] sponsorship and um that's just kind of a
[52:24] something that hit the table when the
[52:26] brothers and I met the other day I
[52:28] didn't remember who suggested it first
[52:30] but I thought it was a great idea and uh
[52:33] you can you can pick a line item brother
[52:35] Anthony and brother Matt are putting
[52:37] together a detailed line item
[52:39] spreadsheet and you'd be able to do that
[52:41] you could pick several of them you can
[52:42] team up with somebody those who are
[52:45] streaming let me say you also uh can be
[52:48] a part and many have and we look forward
[52:51] uh to much more support I'm sure I don't
[52:54] need to preach on tithes and offerings
[52:55] every Christian pays their ties amen
[52:59] amen praise the Lord we've never had to
[53:01] preach too much on that here because
[53:03] your giving has always been very
[53:05] faithful I appreciate it even among uh
[53:08] the majority of our senior youth now
[53:10] those of you young people who are
[53:12] working jobs and been working jobs and
[53:14] haven't paid any TI shame on
[53:16] you and be a Christian and pay your ties
[53:19] that brother R says a Christian Pays His
[53:21] ties and offerings so it's absolutely
[53:24] part of of your worship to the Lord uh
[53:27] now we're not I told I said I'm we're
[53:30] not if you if you line item sponsor the
[53:33] sheetrock we're not going to let you put
[53:36] your family crest on the wall it's not
[53:39] going to be named after you we're not
[53:41] going to have you know a stepen Emily
[53:44] stove or anything like that we're we're
[53:47] not going to do that so but we will
[53:50] deeply deeply appreciate all your giving
[53:53] and I think that I I think we can be
[53:55] ready to go go uh brother Matt sent me
[53:57] just a quick note to just to just to
[54:00] clarify that the dry end stage is where
[54:02] we're trying to get to and uh let me not
[54:05] misquote him um but he says it doesn't
[54:08] mean everything except Furniture dried
[54:11] in means framed all plywood and tyvec
[54:14] exterior windows and doors and shingles
[54:15] it does not include rough trades drywall
[54:19] paint etc etc so um amen so I know
[54:22] brother Kenny knows that we just want to
[54:24] make sure that the way it got said that
[54:26] everything is clear it was U so we just
[54:29] want to double check that amen God bless
[54:31] you turn around and say God bless you to
[54:33] somebody sitting near you amen it's the
[54:36] nicest thing brother Bram said the
[54:38] nicest thing you can say to someone is
[54:40] God bless you amen praise the Lord so
[54:44] we're happy to have you all here today
[54:45] let's stand back to our feet and uh
[54:48] we're going to look at Luke Chapter 2
[54:50] this morning greetings to our visitors
[54:52] here we're happy to have them uh with us
[54:54] today amen
[54:56] praise the
[55:01] Lord Luke Chapter 2 I believe I sent uh
[55:05] we'll start at verse 25 oh and let me
[55:07] get these prayer requests because we'll
[55:09] pray over them as we pray for scriptures
[55:12] um we want to continue to pray for
[55:14] little Addie and also Sister Amy they've
[55:18] both been quite sick and I told Sister
[55:20] Amy this morning that the devil has a
[55:24] good track record seemed like every time
[55:25] I go a abroad he comes in behind me
[55:28] tries to bring sickness into my home you
[55:30] know my wife and and even when my
[55:32] children were at home he would always
[55:33] try to do that and I said you know even
[55:36] if our heavenly father allows it Satan
[55:38] still ain't

[56:42] you got it say
[56:44] Amen we're continuing today uh part four
[56:48] of a brand new book we might be able to
[56:50] conclude it today the Lord willing
[56:52] that's the
[56:53] plan and behold there there was a man in
[56:57] Jerusalem whose name was Simeon and the
[57:00] same man was just and devout waiting for
[57:03] the consolation of Israel and the Holy
[57:05] Ghost was upon
[57:08] him and it was revealed unto him by the
[57:11] holy ghost that he should not see death
[57:14] before he had seen the Lord's Christ and
[57:17] he came by the spirit to the temple and
[57:21] when the parents brought in the Child
[57:23] Jesus to do for him after the custom of
[57:25] the law
[57:27] then took he him up in his arms and
[57:30] blessed God and said Lord now let thou
[57:34] let us thou thy servant depart in peace
[57:38] according to Thy word for mine eyes have
[57:41] seen thy salvation which thou Hast
[57:44] prepared before the face of all
[57:47] people a light to lighten the Gentiles
[57:50] and the glory of thy People
[57:53] Israel and Joseph and his mother
[57:56] marveled at those things which were
[57:59] spoken of him and Simeon blessed them
[58:03] and said unto Mary his mother behold
[58:07] this child is set for the fall and
[58:10] Rising again of many in Israel and for a
[58:13] sign which shall be spoken against yay a
[58:17] sword shall pierce through thine own
[58:20] soul that the thoughts of many hearts
[58:24] may be revealed
[58:27] and there was one Anna a propheus the
[58:31] daughter of penu of the tribe of Asher
[58:34] she was of a great age and had lived
[58:36] with a husband seven years from her
[58:38] virginity and she was a widow for about
[58:41] 4 score and four years which departed
[58:45] not from the temple but served god with
[58:48] fastings and prayers night and day and
[58:51] she coming in that instant gave thanks
[58:54] likewise unto the Lord and spake of him
[58:57] to all them that looked for redemption
[59:02] in
[59:03] Israel let's pray father you heard our
[59:08] requests Lord that came in for prayer
[59:10] we're remembering Lord our team members
[59:13] who are ministering abroad carrying Lord
[59:16] the light of the Gospel pray that your
[59:18] great blessing be upon them Lord and
[59:21] give them strength and understanding
[59:23] father their families at home I pray for
[59:26] extra strength and Care over them Lord
[59:29] we're remembering particularly Sister
[59:31] Amy and Sister Addie under the attack of
[59:33] the enemy but Lord we pray against the
[59:35] work of the devil today and we condemn
[59:37] his works in the name of Jesus Lord we
[59:40] ask that the Holy Spirit The Enforcer of
[59:43] God's word will evict Him Father and
[59:45] move him into dry places that they may
[59:47] be well enjoying the service this
[59:51] morning father I pray for the request
[59:54] that Brother Bruce sent in father we
[59:57] realize that Lord people handle covid
[1:00:00] differently sometimes it can be very a
[1:00:04] great sickness sometimes not so much but
[1:00:06] Lord uh father in an abundance of
[1:00:09] caution we're asking father for your
[1:00:12] love and care to be on the scene right
[1:00:14] away Lord may you bless and heal and
[1:00:18] father we give you thanks and we praise
[1:00:20] you for all these things bless your word
[1:00:23] now that we've read bless both speaker
[1:00:25] and hearer we commit ourselves into your
[1:00:28] hands for service completely in jesus'
[1:00:31] name amen God bless you you can be
[1:00:37] seated I'll have my title slide brother
[1:00:41] Mark praise the
[1:00:46] Lord so we are continuing today with
[1:00:50] this a brand new book this will be part
[1:00:52] four fourth installment and uh I decid
[1:00:56] decited uh to keep the subtitle today
[1:00:59] because it uh it particularly works for
[1:01:02] me not a a simula a simulation but a
[1:01:06] shadow we talked about it a little bit
[1:01:09] last week I have one scripture verse
[1:01:12] that I want to go back and reemphasize
[1:01:14] our text and then I have uh a number of
[1:01:17] quotes from a single message that I've
[1:01:19] got for here and then that'll be it for
[1:01:21] the slide and then I have a couple other
[1:01:24] quotes I want to just read to you want
[1:01:26] to change it up a little bit today and
[1:01:28] again I'd like to take my time and be
[1:01:31] methodical because uh the burden on my
[1:01:34] heart uh is is somewhat Technical and so
[1:01:38] I just covet your prayer and I ask for
[1:01:40] your undivided and Keen attention I'm
[1:01:43] getting a late start so um but
[1:01:46] nonetheless you're you'll be okay I'm
[1:01:48] not a a marathon preacher everybody
[1:01:50] knows that so God bless you as we get
[1:01:53] underway so when we're looking at had a
[1:01:56] brand new book part four not a
[1:01:58] simulation but a shadow we look at our
[1:02:02] verse that we read and he came this was
[1:02:06] Simeon and this is what I want to look
[1:02:08] at particularly he came by the spirit
[1:02:12] into the temple when the parents brought
[1:02:15] in the Child Jesus to do for him after
[1:02:20] the custom of the law then took he him
[1:02:25] up and his arms and he blessed God now
[1:02:29] it's amazing how the Lord is is is is
[1:02:34] wording this because when we read from
[1:02:37] our opening text the Bible says this
[1:02:40] that the Holy Ghost uh was upon him now
[1:02:43] that's very unique because the Holy
[1:02:45] Ghost came on Moses it came on Great Men
[1:02:48] of God down Through the Ages we know
[1:02:50] that there was a a distinct difference
[1:02:53] when the Holy Spirit came Upon Jesus and
[1:02:57] remained upon him and that we've taught
[1:02:59] on that before that was where John was
[1:03:01] told it wasn't it wouldn't be unique for
[1:03:03] John to see the spirit of God descend
[1:03:06] upon upon a person it had descended upon
[1:03:08] him from his mother's womb see so that
[1:03:12] part wouldn't be unique uh but there was
[1:03:15] a unique application in that said when
[1:03:18] you see it descend upon him and remain
[1:03:22] then you'll know that this is Messiah
[1:03:24] because that's never never been possible
[1:03:26] before that is to Simply say that God by
[1:03:29] the Holy Ghost had always been able to
[1:03:32] anoint his servants and his Messengers
[1:03:35] be they men be they women be they a
[1:03:37] prophet be they a prophetess you know
[1:03:39] those kinds of things operated down
[1:03:41] through the Old Testament so what I want
[1:03:45] to emphas I don't want you to get stuck
[1:03:46] on that today it's not the same thing as
[1:03:49] what fell in the upper room which is
[1:03:51] what you have access to and that's the
[1:03:54] beauty of it because
[1:03:56] because brother brandham talks about
[1:03:58] David and how that the thing that
[1:04:01] wearied David and this was David's weary
[1:04:04] that David he he said that I I I have
[1:04:08] kept the Lord his always before me I
[1:04:12] meditate on his word night and day I've
[1:04:15] tied it to my bedst I put it between my
[1:04:17] eyes I think on it constantly and so
[1:04:20] brother brandham says the thing that
[1:04:22] wearied David is even after doing all of
[1:04:25] that he still knew that he couldn't
[1:04:29] quite get it to live through him like he
[1:04:31] thought it ought to that he knew this is
[1:04:34] the spirit of God and it it somehow
[1:04:36] ought to have more control over my
[1:04:39] spirit and so that that was David's
[1:04:42] weary he said that's the thing that
[1:04:43] wearied David and I'm I'm glad today
[1:04:46] friends to say to you you don't have to
[1:04:48] suffer David's weary you have the
[1:04:51] ability now to let the Holy Spirit come
[1:04:54] inside you and give a change of your
[1:04:57] nature so that now you have an inside
[1:05:00] Force as well as a Heavenly influence
[1:05:03] and the word preaching now you've got it
[1:05:05] above you with you in you through you
[1:05:10] Hallelujah therefore greater is he that
[1:05:13] is in you good news greater is he that
[1:05:17] is in you than he that is in the world
[1:05:20] you now have the actual ability it
[1:05:23] doesn't say you'll do it but now now you
[1:05:26] actually have the the true freedom to
[1:05:32] choose people walk away from the word of
[1:05:34] God because they say I want my freedom
[1:05:37] they don't realize only the word of God
[1:05:39] gives you your freedom otherwise you're
[1:05:40] not born again and you're subject you're
[1:05:42] still a slave to an old Fallen nature
[1:05:46] and the best you can do is grit your
[1:05:48] teeth because you don't want to go to
[1:05:50] hell and you would like to make a
[1:05:51] Rapture so you grit your teeth and try
[1:05:54] to live it I'm here to tell you that
[1:05:55] doesn't end well and after a while you
[1:05:57] wear out and after a while you collapse
[1:06:00] on that let me say to you today thank
[1:06:02] God it's not about gritting your teeth
[1:06:04] or performing a list of dos and don'ts
[1:06:07] Just Surrender and let the Holy Spirit
[1:06:10] come inside he will change your want to
[1:06:14] he will make you want to serve God he
[1:06:17] will make it a joy to surrender the
[1:06:19] things of the world now you'll still be
[1:06:21] tempted in the flesh but now you
[1:06:24] actually have the
[1:06:26] ability to deny
[1:06:29] it amen that's I call that
[1:06:34] freedom when I have the ability it
[1:06:38] doesn't mean I'll always do it J James
[1:06:40] said that there has no temptation taken
[1:06:43] you but such as is common to man so quit
[1:06:48] crying stand up and act like a son or
[1:06:51] daughter of God get get away from
[1:06:54] brother like Brother Jules Says wowy
[1:06:56] wowy Wooo poor old me you know get over
[1:06:59] yourself there's no temptation taking
[1:07:01] you but such as is common to man I'll
[1:07:04] promise you you haven't suffered under
[1:07:07] blood so come on let let's let's be Sons
[1:07:10] and Daughters of god let's be rugged and
[1:07:13] so so we find out that that James says
[1:07:16] there's no temptation taken you but such
[1:07:18] as is common to man but within that that
[1:07:21] moment God will make a way that you may
[1:07:26] doesn't say you will but you could
[1:07:28] Escape it see so you have to really
[1:07:32] friends it's going to come down to this
[1:07:34] and hear me good I think this will help
[1:07:35] you it helped me this is these are
[1:07:38] realizations that have helped me all all
[1:07:40] my Christian Life to be an
[1:07:42] overcomer and to realize how to overcome
[1:07:45] better when I
[1:07:48] Stumble come on all you holy
[1:07:51] people yeah let's own it but but I but I
[1:07:55] but I I started thinking about it like
[1:07:58] this do I is my love for him greater
[1:08:03] than the lustful desire in My Flesh and
[1:08:07] I conclude every time yep it is I love
[1:08:11] him more than I than the desire of
[1:08:14] whatever happens to be trying to anoint
[1:08:16] My Flesh be it whatever it is the whole
[1:08:20] Gambit you know of of of of the lust of
[1:08:22] the Flesh and the pride of life and the
[1:08:24] lust of the those three deadly things
[1:08:26] that Jesus talked about and all the
[1:08:28] subcategories that go underneath them
[1:08:30] let your love for him that's why your
[1:08:33] your Christianity is not about working
[1:08:36] on it's not about working on trying to
[1:08:39] to overcome as in Works your your your
[1:08:43] work to do is to increase your
[1:08:45] relationship with Christ see and then
[1:08:50] the love of God will grow in your heart
[1:08:52] and you will find more strength than you
[1:08:54] would find mind when you don't do that
[1:08:57] good in order to have good things you
[1:09:00] know a a good relationship requires that
[1:09:03] you you you do good things within that
[1:09:06] relationship to keep it good all right
[1:09:10] so when you don't do that when you find
[1:09:12] yourself away from your Bible away from
[1:09:15] your prayer time your disciplines have
[1:09:17] fail your church attendance has fell
[1:09:19] your fellowship has fallen down on Hard
[1:09:21] Times you know I would just say to you
[1:09:24] today don't stay there kid back up pick
[1:09:28] up the sword press the battle you're
[1:09:30] only a half a step out of cadence it
[1:09:32] only takes a half a step to get back in
[1:09:34] military Precision see so we've
[1:09:37] demonstrated that to you before so
[1:09:40] now so when I when we talk about the
[1:09:43] spirit coming upon Simeon now I want to
[1:09:46] key on that I'm going to segue to my
[1:09:48] next point so when the when the spirit
[1:09:51] ComEd upon Came Upon Simeon it actually
[1:09:55] moved
[1:09:57] him so now if I could just say it to you
[1:10:00] in plain language that that we can
[1:10:02] really get so a human being got moved by
[1:10:07] an alien
[1:10:10] force
[1:10:12] amen so so there's more things alive
[1:10:17] than just what we can see in
[1:10:21] contact Brother Matt read us that quote
[1:10:23] not too long ago about how that you know
[1:10:26] great I forget how it goes great
[1:10:27] meetings and with great anointing and
[1:10:29] and he said you turn around and it feels
[1:10:31] like you bumped into somebody he said
[1:10:32] you might have just bumped into an
[1:10:34] angel these things are
[1:10:36] real this is what moved Simeon Simeon
[1:10:40] didn't just decide oh there's a there's
[1:10:43] a cute baby I'm GNA go see a cute baby
[1:10:46] Simeon wasn't just trying to you know
[1:10:48] believe you know and make himself
[1:10:50] believe Simeon got moved
[1:10:53] upon there was a for there was a spirit
[1:10:57] there was a positive not just a shadow
[1:11:00] see so we're not in a simulation as I
[1:11:03] said last time but we are in a shadow as
[1:11:06] a negative and brother brandham just
[1:11:08] said it's that great circle and that was
[1:11:11] all eternity but Adam and Eve fell from
[1:11:15] eternity and he said it put a little
[1:11:17] Loop down which Loops down in time for
[1:11:20] Redemption and then it brings comes back
[1:11:23] up into eternity we're almost ready to
[1:11:25] go back into eternity that's where we
[1:11:27] are friends that's where we are that's
[1:11:30] what's up that's what's happening right
[1:11:32] now I'm here to tell you it's not just
[1:11:33] going to go on and on and on it
[1:11:35] can't mankind is facing an Extinction
[1:11:39] event that he can't avoid knowing that
[1:11:41] he's doing it he can't help but do it am
[1:11:44] you're talking about being a prisoner
[1:11:47] that they know that they know nuclear
[1:11:51] war is Annihilation but they're going to
[1:11:53] do it
[1:11:55] they know Armageddon will bring an end
[1:11:58] to humanity but they're going to do it
[1:11:59] anyway say how do you know they're going
[1:12:01] to do it the Bible says they're going to
[1:12:02] do it the Bible prophesies about it see
[1:12:07] so so we realize that that I I want to
[1:12:10] get that in your mind today that in this
[1:12:13] Shadow existence that we live in there's
[1:12:15] a positive that's more real than this
[1:12:17] one and that's what was moving on Simeon
[1:12:20] and that's what you need to have moving
[1:12:21] on
[1:12:22] you watch now so brandham says in
[1:12:26] Harvest Time
[1:12:28] 1964 say I want to bring you conscious
[1:12:32] of that before we approach farther that
[1:12:36] God is in this room amen the author of
[1:12:41] this word is
[1:12:44] here God looks at your heart thank God
[1:12:49] and he looks in my heart and we're
[1:12:52] judged from our heart thank God not even
[1:12:55] our words our heart judges us from the
[1:12:59] heart speaketh the mouth if it if it
[1:13:02] isn't it's hypocrisy so in other words
[1:13:05] that either your heart is speaking and
[1:13:09] agreeing with God's word or your life is
[1:13:11] a life of hypocrisy see because you're
[1:13:15] living in a shadow realm that God never
[1:13:17] intended for you to stay in doesn't
[1:13:20] matter how long you're in this world you
[1:13:22] may live out your whole life and expire
[1:13:25] and your expiration date may come up and
[1:13:28] we may take you out to the cemetery but
[1:13:30] but I I want my life to count while I'm
[1:13:33] here I want it to be a reflection of a
[1:13:36] positive somewhere now it's that
[1:13:39] somewhere that's what I want you to be
[1:13:41] cognizant of today there's a somewhere
[1:13:43] that ain't
[1:13:44] here there's a something that's not this
[1:13:48] there's a higher than this lower there's
[1:13:50] a positive to this
[1:13:52] Shadow all right
[1:13:55] so he says he goes
[1:13:57] on now in this room now is coming human
[1:14:01] beings now he's going to talk about in
[1:14:02] the Realms of science this is going to
[1:14:04] be incontrovertible you're about to hear
[1:14:06] what he's going to say forms of human
[1:14:08] beings passing through here from all
[1:14:10] around the world voices singing in this
[1:14:13] room right now but you see you are only
[1:14:17] limited in your senses to a certain
[1:14:19] percent of sight but but now you can
[1:14:23] take the crystal or the tube or whatever
[1:14:27] that's in the television and turn it on
[1:14:30] and with with the set that could uh um
[1:14:33] let me catch up to myself here you can
[1:14:36] take the crystal or the tube or whatever
[1:14:38] that's in the television and turn it on
[1:14:40] and with that set that could deviate
[1:14:43] that on those ether waves and deviate
[1:14:46] that to condense it into a channel to
[1:14:49] pick up those people some in Australia
[1:14:52] South Africa or where India or wherever
[1:14:55] ever it may be now we know that's true
[1:14:59] there you you you know the television is
[1:15:03] not seeing Australia but Australia is
[1:15:08] broadcasting a signal of real people
[1:15:12] that is in this room in Shadow in
[1:15:15] negative your eyes don't see it but it's
[1:15:18] here and the proof is turn on the TV and
[1:15:20] the TV proves it's passing right here
[1:15:22] colors people see so now I'm starting to
[1:15:26] push your mind I'm doing this on purpose
[1:15:28] I'm trying to push your mind see now it
[1:15:30] took a profet to to to to bring all of
[1:15:33] this to our
[1:15:36] attention say well science knew that
[1:15:38] well they're not they're they don't know
[1:15:40] about what he's about to say watch
[1:15:42] this so he says just flip on the
[1:15:45] television see if
[1:15:49] um wherever it may be you can stand
[1:15:53] here on a screen and even see the color
[1:15:57] of clothes that they got the hair of the
[1:16:01] color of the trees and every move they
[1:16:04] make just flip on the television see if
[1:16:08] that isn't so all right now watch watch
[1:16:10] him take it to a deeper
[1:16:13] level then it's got to be somewhere hid
[1:16:16] from our eyes see that's the point he's
[1:16:18] making he's not his point is not about
[1:16:21] you know a television or a broadcast
[1:16:24] from Australia
[1:16:25] his point is that you don't see
[1:16:29] everything see but it's
[1:16:32] real see but you got to have a special
[1:16:34] set to see it and to hear it but it is
[1:16:37] real see it's a form of real all right
[1:16:41] so so he says then it's got to be
[1:16:44] somewhere hid from our eyes that same
[1:16:48] thing is passing through here now see
[1:16:51] remember he said God is in this room and
[1:16:55] then he uses that to kind of push your
[1:16:57] brain push your mind to go wow no no God
[1:17:00] actually really is in this room okay so
[1:17:04] he says that same thing is passing
[1:17:07] through here now it P now here watch
[1:17:10] this it passed through here when Abraham
[1:17:13] heard God say look up toward the stars
[1:17:16] now he's not talking about
[1:17:18] television he's talking about that same
[1:17:21] ether but only now it's not a a camera a
[1:17:24] a satellite broadcasting it's a higher
[1:17:27] power see it passed through here when
[1:17:30] Abraham heard God say look up towards
[1:17:34] the Stars it was here when Elijah sat on
[1:17:38] Mount Carmel you ever heard Einstein say
[1:17:40] that I promise you
[1:17:43] haven't it was here when Elijah sat on
[1:17:47] Mount Carmel it was here when Adam was
[1:17:51] here but they just now discovered it so
[1:17:55] who's the real scientist man or God
[1:17:58] see I remember as a child and my mom
[1:18:02] teaching me the Bible with her wonderful
[1:18:04] stories of the Bible that our our um
[1:18:08] youth are enjoying and that was one of
[1:18:11] the unique things she used to always
[1:18:12] point out to me in the Book of
[1:18:13] Revelation that the whole world would
[1:18:14] see Moses and Elijah laying in the
[1:18:16] street and Mom just looked at me and
[1:18:17] said how do you suppose that's going to
[1:18:18] happen without satellite
[1:18:22] television now I just think wow
[1:18:25] wow my mom is
[1:18:30] smart
[1:18:34] see and so is God here and the angels
[1:18:39] and
[1:18:40] someday you believe a prophet someday
[1:18:44] it'll be just as much reality as
[1:18:47] television or anything else is because
[1:18:49] the spirit will bring up into that
[1:18:53] Immortal Life then will'll understand so
[1:18:57] then we are speaking from his word see
[1:19:00] so now he goes on he jumps down quite a
[1:19:02] bit into into the message and he says
[1:19:05] here then after Adam had fell Tried by
[1:19:09] the word and fell God continued in his
[1:19:13] creation to find a man who would live
[1:19:16] every word amen now we all know he never
[1:19:20] did until
[1:19:22] Jesus all the Great Men fell somewhere
[1:19:24] where see beginning with Adam and they
[1:19:26] all fell but only finally Jesus didn't
[1:19:30] all the way from Adam to John the
[1:19:32] Baptist who acknowledged him and then
[1:19:35] doubted him see all the way to you know
[1:19:39] Moses who who lost his temper got kept
[1:19:42] out of the promised land Abraham who got
[1:19:45] caught conniving and lying
[1:19:47] twice see so and we won't even talk
[1:19:50] about Jacob brother BR said you got to
[1:19:51] really believe in the grace of God to
[1:19:53] count Jacob
[1:19:55] amen see and and Neah time would fail me
[1:19:58] to speak of David or or Samson see so
[1:20:02] but but the grace of God kept going the
[1:20:05] Christ seed kept going say how do you
[1:20:08] know kept going I'm here ain't I how do
[1:20:10] you know you're it cuz I believe this
[1:20:12] don't I Hallelujah you realize how
[1:20:14] impossible that is if you're not in the
[1:20:16] Christ line you can't believe this
[1:20:18] that's what this
[1:20:20] says it's only Those whom the Lord will
[1:20:23] reveal it to
[1:20:25] so as far as Redemption is concerned we
[1:20:27] know God Saves many millions from
[1:20:30] destruction granting them eternal life
[1:20:31] for various reasons he's very fair and
[1:20:34] everybody will get a fair trial don't
[1:20:36] worry you don't have to ask pondering
[1:20:38] questions what about the Heathen what
[1:20:39] about God's got a plan for that what
[1:20:42] about my neighbor who's got God's got a
[1:20:44] plan for that but but only the only the
[1:20:47] predestinated are considered in
[1:20:48] Redemption I'm here today preaching on
[1:20:50] Redemption I'm here preaching to people
[1:20:52] who are Redeemed by the blood of the the
[1:20:57] lamb God's got it all don't worry he
[1:20:59] knows way more about it than you
[1:21:01] do just trust
[1:21:04] him so so he
[1:21:07] says all right so he says
[1:21:10] um then after
[1:21:13] Adam had fell Tried by the word and God
[1:21:16] continued in his creation to try to find
[1:21:17] a man who would live every word now look
[1:21:20] he tried to find man that is live the
[1:21:22] word for his age now you see God
[1:21:25] scattered his word out because he could
[1:21:27] that's a good reason he is he is
[1:21:31] infinite and he is
[1:21:34] omnipresent omniscient therefore he
[1:21:37] knows all things he can't be present
[1:21:40] Everywhere by being omniscient knowing
[1:21:43] all things then he can be present
[1:21:46] everywhere see God is Not Like the
[1:21:49] Wind he is a being he lives in a house
[1:21:53] but his omniscience makes him everywhere
[1:21:55] at once cuz he knows all things so it's
[1:21:58] a form of being everywhere you got to
[1:22:00] you got to go I'm pushing your minds
[1:22:01] today friends you got to get you got to
[1:22:04] go beyond these little these little
[1:22:06] shadowy Realms that you live in I'm
[1:22:08] that's why we have a prophet who could
[1:22:10] come these secrets were always in the
[1:22:12] word of God but Menage men couldn't
[1:22:15] break into it because the secrets to
[1:22:17] Redemption are
[1:22:18] hidden the secrets to Redemption the
[1:22:21] parts of the Bible that refer to
[1:22:23] Redemption that it's election based on
[1:22:25] origin and it's it's it's in God before
[1:22:27] the foundation of the world all
[1:22:29] denominations deny that that they say
[1:22:32] brother Brandon went too far to say it
[1:22:35] like that it doesn't matter how many
[1:22:37] scriptures you read to them I've had
[1:22:39] them I've read them those scriptures and
[1:22:41] they try to tell me Well it don't mean
[1:22:43] that but I'm I'm telling you what it
[1:22:44] said I'm not trying to tell you what it
[1:22:46] means I'm telling you what it said Jesus
[1:22:49] said all the father has given me will
[1:22:51] come and I won't lose one and he said
[1:22:54] that thousands of years before the the
[1:22:57] church was even all had all come into
[1:22:59] the Earth you're here and you're a
[1:23:01] believer I'm here to tell you he saw you
[1:23:04] as a Believer and he knew you would be a
[1:23:09] believer see and this is why God will
[1:23:12] have mercy on many people who aren't in
[1:23:14] Redemption they'll still gain eternal
[1:23:16] life because you can't disbelieve what
[1:23:17] you don't know it's not given Jesus said
[1:23:20] that why do you speak in Parables
[1:23:22] because to you it's given to know the
[1:23:23] mysteries of the Kingdom to them it's
[1:23:24] not
[1:23:25] given lest they should see with their
[1:23:28] eyes and understand with their hearts
[1:23:29] and then I have to heal them I have to
[1:23:31] save them I have to redeem them and
[1:23:32] that's not my plan see and that's that's
[1:23:36] that's out there that pushes the Mind
[1:23:39] see but it's the
[1:23:42] truth so when he comes to this now so
[1:23:45] now then we come
[1:23:48] to where I was trying to get us to look
[1:23:52] at last time when we ran out of time
[1:23:55] because of the the Insight of a prophet
[1:23:58] we realize that we have positive and
[1:24:02] negative
[1:24:04] worlds now I'm not talking about a
[1:24:06] Multiverse that's science fiction that's
[1:24:08] their best idea they know there's
[1:24:09] something to it and there is something
[1:24:11] to it there is positive and negative
[1:24:13] worlds see you're brother brandham when
[1:24:16] if you want to interpret that correctly
[1:24:18] you look at brother bram's quote where
[1:24:20] you're in a great service and you're in
[1:24:22] a negative world but there's positive
[1:24:24] beings around you you might bump into
[1:24:26] one of them but when you turn you don't
[1:24:27] see anyone see so I mean what do you
[1:24:31] think it was that came into a negative
[1:24:36] Shadow and took a a vessel specially
[1:24:40] built as prophets are and brother
[1:24:43] brandham would say now the woman Fades
[1:24:45] out and he says the pillar of fire moves
[1:24:48] between me and the woman and she Fades
[1:24:50] out he says oh I see you're in a
[1:24:53] doctor's office
[1:24:54] now he's in he's in her
[1:24:56] past and your doctor is a little short
[1:24:59] fat man with big thick glasses and he's
[1:25:02] trying to say to you that you have and
[1:25:05] brother brandham couldn't even pronounce
[1:25:07] it and he said he said you
[1:25:09] have do and she says do aema he goes
[1:25:12] yeah do do aema I heard him say that to
[1:25:14] you and he says now you don't have it
[1:25:17] anymore Jesus Christ makes you whole now
[1:25:19] he's in the future so brother brandham
[1:25:22] said you see and this is his language he
[1:25:24] said see you go
[1:25:27] somewhere and he said but there's still
[1:25:30] he said that's why you'll hear brother
[1:25:31] brandham say if the audience can still
[1:25:34] hear me he didn't even know he said you
[1:25:37] go somewhere but yet there's a part of
[1:25:38] you that's back here just enough of you
[1:25:40] still back here that you can kind of
[1:25:42] you're in a dimensional Channel I'm here
[1:25:45] to tell you something friend that's not
[1:25:46] Star Trek or Star Wars that's
[1:25:49] Heavenly we have a positive world and a
[1:25:51] negative world and I'm here to tell you
[1:25:53] that two world are colliding and they're
[1:25:56] starting to slow down and we're starting
[1:25:58] to speed up and one of these days it's
[1:26:00] going to lift you up from here into
[1:26:02] another dimension you're not going to go
[1:26:04] past Mars in the Milky Way you're just
[1:26:06] going to step through a doorway and
[1:26:08] you're going to be suddenly in another
[1:26:09] body in another realm Hallelujah and
[1:26:12] another reality a greater
[1:26:19] reality we have a fading out of this one
[1:26:25] and a going into the other
[1:26:27] one and it's
[1:26:29] underway it's
[1:26:31] underway where we are today in the word
[1:26:34] and in
[1:26:35] Prophecy we didn't get here by accident
[1:26:39] and we're not going to continue
[1:26:41] here you can't stay here you don't want
[1:26:44] to stay here because here is going to
[1:26:47] Ash and cender and I don't want to do
[1:26:50] that I want to keep going
[1:26:56] we were showing you how in film
[1:26:58] photography you have negatives and
[1:27:01] positives and the reason that we use
[1:27:03] film photography is because that's what
[1:27:05] brother bandam was talking about you can
[1:27:06] even go and he talks about focusing the
[1:27:08] camera lens and you remember I think
[1:27:10] last time we read about people who who
[1:27:13] they don't they don't have their camera
[1:27:14] lens focused enough they're looking at
[1:27:16] the word but they don't have it focused
[1:27:18] and he said they see three and four Gods
[1:27:21] he said you're you're you're too far
[1:27:23] back there in the Reformation come on up
[1:27:25] here Focus keep focusing I promise you
[1:27:29] it'll bring them all into one It Go and
[1:27:31] you'll see it you say wow he really is
[1:27:34] just one see you say well what well then
[1:27:39] well then doesn't the Holy Spirit and
[1:27:42] and Jesus the human make him three well
[1:27:46] I if you think that's a twister how
[1:27:48] about this you're part of his
[1:27:51] godhead now does that make him four
[1:27:54] and every one of us and you're making
[1:27:56] him five and you're making him six and
[1:27:57] you're making him seven it's all one
[1:27:59] it's just God by expression this is
[1:28:02] another way that he's everywhere at once
[1:28:04] because he fills all time space and
[1:28:06] Eternity his word created everything
[1:28:09] that is out of nothing so all nature
[1:28:12] that's why the Earth can't be
[1:28:13] annihilated oh thank God for a Kentucky
[1:28:15] hillbilly that's why the world can't be
[1:28:18] annihilated because it's an eternal
[1:28:20] attribute of God
[1:28:27] so when we look at why are negatives
[1:28:30] negative the thing that makes a a when
[1:28:33] you're talking about a on paper now
[1:28:36] we're not talking about the digital
[1:28:38] world uh there's quite a Renaissance of
[1:28:40] going back to film by professional
[1:28:42] photographers I said that last time and
[1:28:45] it it literally means
[1:28:47] that negatives are negatives because
[1:28:50] they have inverted colors and
[1:28:52] tones and the negative film and you and
[1:28:55] I had to this is sourced from Kodak
[1:28:58] their website and Britannica also just
[1:29:00] in case you're wondering where the
[1:29:01] source is and so we find that that in
[1:29:05] the negative film the colors and tones
[1:29:09] are inverted to the actual scene see and
[1:29:13] in fact is this means that light areas
[1:29:15] in the original scene appear dark on the
[1:29:18] negative and dark areas appear light so
[1:29:20] so basically what it's saying is is that
[1:29:23] is that every thing is
[1:29:25] inverted and and I and now now apply
[1:29:28] that to you like brother Brandon was
[1:29:29] doing and I can see myself because my
[1:29:32] whole life's
[1:29:33] inverted and and the the light areas
[1:29:37] that were supposed to be that are light
[1:29:39] in the vision of God might look dark in
[1:29:42] me but I'm only a negative he's changing
[1:29:45] me into a positive and then I'm going to
[1:29:48] look exactly like the vision that he had
[1:29:51] in his
[1:29:52] mind they put them under light you have
[1:29:55] to put it under light they put it that's
[1:29:57] what causes light to strike that that
[1:29:59] film and that creates a negative then
[1:30:00] then a chemical process it's a process
[1:30:03] it keeps going he's still working on me
[1:30:05] I'm in a process what's happening to you
[1:30:07] why aren't you like the world because
[1:30:09] I'm in a I'm in a I'm in a dark room but
[1:30:11] I'm being processed into a new image and
[1:30:14] when I come out I'll look like I'm
[1:30:16] supposed to that's why when he said I'll
[1:30:19] meet you in there and brother R says why
[1:30:21] is because it'll it won't be a public
[1:30:23] show and people were going inside and
[1:30:26] and they had maimed and problems and
[1:30:27] this and they came out perfectly whole
[1:30:29] and normal and they said what happened
[1:30:31] to you in there and they said I don't
[1:30:33] know I can't explain it but I got a
[1:30:35] whole new
[1:30:36] body hallelu Hallelujah
[1:30:40] friends so the term negative comes from
[1:30:43] the fact that the image is the opposite
[1:30:45] of what the final photograph will look
[1:30:47] like thanks be to
[1:30:49] God
[1:30:51] so if you are disappointed in me could I
[1:30:57] please say to you that I'm the opposite
[1:30:59] of what I will be
[1:31:02] someday
[1:31:03] amen one of these days I'm going to be
[1:31:06] positive and you know who you know
[1:31:08] who'll be the happiest person in the
[1:31:09] world not sister Debbie the happiest
[1:31:11] person in the world would be me when I
[1:31:14] look in that mirror and go yeah you
[1:31:15] finally got here
[1:31:18] hallelujah oh I want to I I I want to
[1:31:21] you know brother Brandon talks about how
[1:31:23] that I'm glad a prophet could know the
[1:31:24] first thought that'll go through my mind
[1:31:26] well hey if a prophet could know what
[1:31:28] Satan thought in his
[1:31:30] heart and he said Isaiah busted him
[1:31:33] totally outed him to the whole world
[1:31:34] you've said in your heart I will Ascend
[1:31:37] be like
[1:31:39] God don't say that I'm going to write it
[1:31:41] in a book I'm GNA send it to the whole
[1:31:44] world you said in your heart I will
[1:31:46] Ascend above the Stars thanks for that I
[1:31:49] happen to be one of those stars and I
[1:31:51] got news for you that's not going to
[1:31:52] work Hallelujah I got news for the devil
[1:31:55] plan all you want but that's not going
[1:31:57] to happen I'm going to be back there one
[1:32:00] of these days when morning Stars sang
[1:32:03] together and sons of God shouted for Joy
[1:32:06] it's affecting my life even
[1:32:08] now causes me to love him causes me to
[1:32:11] want to serve him it causes me to think
[1:32:13] outside the box it causes me to know
[1:32:15] that this life is not about this life
[1:32:17] it's about the next one
[1:32:22] Hallelujah so to create a positive image
[1:32:25] the negative is projected on the
[1:32:26] photographic paper in a dark room this
[1:32:28] paper is then exposed to light the
[1:32:30] paper's then developed in another
[1:32:31] chemical bath which results in a
[1:32:34] positive image so I'm getting a word
[1:32:37] bath so of the finished
[1:32:41] photographs are called
[1:32:44] positives because they
[1:32:47] accurately depict the colors and tones
[1:32:50] of the original
[1:32:52] scene blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:32:56] unlike negatives which is an inverted
[1:33:00] representation I understand me so much
[1:33:03] better I I and you know who you know
[1:33:06] what else I understand I understand
[1:33:08] better than ever the devil's a
[1:33:10] liar and that guy is just a straight
[1:33:13] liar in fact is the diaglot the Greek
[1:33:16] diaglot says that when Satan speaketh a
[1:33:18] lie he speaks his native language
[1:33:23] speaking his native language lying is
[1:33:26] Jesus identified people that were of
[1:33:28] their father the devil he said he was a
[1:33:30] liar from the beginning he was a murder
[1:33:32] from the beginning you're doing the same
[1:33:34] thing see but we be of Abraham we can
[1:33:38] prove it we've got the family tree we've
[1:33:40] got the we've got the family record
[1:33:42] Jesus didn't even deny that he didn't
[1:33:44] deny their their genes their family
[1:33:46] record that they could go all the way
[1:33:47] back to Abraham but he said I that's
[1:33:50] just a
[1:33:51] negative that it someday you'll
[1:33:53] understand he said one day I looked up
[1:33:55] and realized I'm actually not the son of
[1:33:57] Charles and Ella Bram see that's why we
[1:34:00] were saying last time David could have
[1:34:01] looked up and said I'm actually not the
[1:34:03] son of Jesse and the and the sevs I I'm
[1:34:06] I'm actually I I I'm glad for Ruth and
[1:34:08] Boaz but they're actually not my great
[1:34:10] grandparents I came from God
[1:34:15] see so so we we we find that it's it's
[1:34:20] it's beautiful I don't just want to keep
[1:34:21] staying on the scientific site of that I
[1:34:22] think you get my point so but but but to
[1:34:27] conclude negatives are called such
[1:34:30] because they represent an inverted
[1:34:32] version of the final image with reverse
[1:34:36] colors and tones finished photographs
[1:34:37] are called positives because they
[1:34:39] display the true to life colors and
[1:34:41] tones of the original scene so so when
[1:34:44] brother Brandon would talk about Shadow
[1:34:47] see then he' he immediately would switch
[1:34:49] and say you know like a negative see all
[1:34:51] right so when we look at it this way way
[1:34:54] we realize that this in that that your
[1:34:57] life as a Believer now I know you were
[1:35:01] born I I know the hospital I was born at
[1:35:03] I know the city I've got a birth
[1:35:05] certificate I've got the testimony of
[1:35:07] sister Jean I was actually born on a
[1:35:09] Sunday on August the 4th at about 700 am
[1:35:11] so I said wow the Lord had me born on
[1:35:13] the day because he knew this would be my
[1:35:15] job amen I told my family today I said
[1:35:18] for my birthday I get to go to work and
[1:35:20] take all my family
[1:35:23] it's actually sister Debbie said you
[1:35:25] ought to tell him that so I put it in
[1:35:28] there but understand friends that your
[1:35:30] life is more than that young people your
[1:35:33] life is more than that it actually
[1:35:35] involves moving from a state of being
[1:35:38] obscure and negative to one that is
[1:35:40] clear and positive and and that happens
[1:35:43] because you've been exposed to God's
[1:35:46] light you've been explo exposed to
[1:35:49] transformative power the power of
[1:35:52] transformation
[1:35:54] that's not a that's not a figment of
[1:35:56] imagination that's not a slick title
[1:35:58] William brandom came up with Paul said
[1:36:01] be not conformed to this world cuz you
[1:36:04] can be but be transformed by the
[1:36:06] renewing of your
[1:36:08] mind he's basically saying stop living
[1:36:11] for here you do live here but stop
[1:36:13] living for here and start living before
[1:36:16] you're there for
[1:36:18] there amen while you're living here stop
[1:36:21] living for here before before you get
[1:36:24] there start living for
[1:36:26] there see so there's a direct analogy
[1:36:29] between even film processing and
[1:36:31] spiritual transformation in the New
[1:36:33] Birth so you know it's a it's a a
[1:36:37] meaningful
[1:36:39] regeneration of your life that's what
[1:36:41] Jesus asked them can you go with me we
[1:36:44] want to sit on your left and right can
[1:36:45] you go with me through the Regeneration
[1:36:48] can you suffer the things I'll suffer
[1:36:50] hey Lord we can do it well you will more
[1:36:54] than you know but what you're asking is
[1:36:57] not even mine to give see so it it gives
[1:37:00] us a meaningful regeneration of our
[1:37:03] life and and and that means that the
[1:37:07] Holy Ghost par parallels in many ways
[1:37:11] all not just photography but all kinds
[1:37:13] of Science and in fact as I I was I was
[1:37:17] looking at some of the things you know I
[1:37:19] I was doing a search the other day on an
[1:37:22] llm and and I just I just popped in
[1:37:25] there this is what William brandham
[1:37:28] believed and it sound it sounds to the
[1:37:30] most modern theologians like this guy
[1:37:33] has just lost his
[1:37:35] marbles this is some of the stuff that
[1:37:37] they say he went off the deep end on and
[1:37:40] I said does this does this kind of a
[1:37:43] thing appear in scientific theory and it
[1:37:45] was like absolutely absolutely yes it
[1:37:48] appears in string steer appears in this
[1:37:50] relativity appears in this appears in
[1:37:52] appears in in in membrane Theory appears
[1:37:54] and all of these things and actually the
[1:37:56] things that brother Brandon was saying
[1:37:57] in the
[1:37:58] 1960s science is just now understanding
[1:38:02] they only understood chaos in the 70s
[1:38:04] they're just now coming along with
[1:38:06] string theory they're just now
[1:38:08] understanding some of these things and
[1:38:09] we've preached on them before God is the
[1:38:11] greatest
[1:38:13] scientist scien is just they just broke
[1:38:15] into his laboratory he turned his back
[1:38:17] and left the door unlocked and yo y'all
[1:38:19] hurry up you know and let them get a
[1:38:21] little bit just enough power without his
[1:38:24] character to become satanic and Destroy
[1:38:28] themselves I'm here to tell you there's
[1:38:30] a master mind running this thing you can
[1:38:35] relax Shalom today friend Shalom there's
[1:38:38] a master
[1:38:40] mind controlling it all he's controlling
[1:38:42] them he's controlling this he's
[1:38:44] controlling you he's controlling here
[1:38:46] He's Got The Whole World in His
[1:38:51] Hands it's the love of God that brings
[1:38:53] Clarity and life where where we lived
[1:38:56] once in darkness and and obscurity
[1:38:58] brother brandham says in the handwriting
[1:39:00] on the wall now I'm going to turn a
[1:39:03] corner I've only been going about 40
[1:39:05] minutes so give me give me my last 15 to
[1:39:07] 20
[1:39:08] minutes so brother Ram says in the
[1:39:11] handwriting on the
[1:39:12] wall these are the ones I didn't put on
[1:39:14] the
[1:39:15] screen he says I want you to notice the
[1:39:18] beginning of the Gentiles when God dealt
[1:39:20] with them they got hoty in their heart
[1:39:23] and forced every man to worship the
[1:39:25] image of a holy man this is from
[1:39:27] 1956 one year before the nation would
[1:39:30] turn its back on God for the last
[1:39:33] time and a leodan
[1:39:35] messenger prior to Malachi 4 being being
[1:39:39] being in play is now is now trying to
[1:39:42] straighten them out he certainly what's
[1:39:44] in play is revelation 3:22 he's a
[1:39:47] messenger see he's a messenger to the to
[1:39:50] the age and so he was born a prophet he
[1:39:52] was always a Prophet so it doesn't
[1:39:54] matter what year the quote comes from so
[1:39:56] when what year did he say it in the year
[1:39:58] he was a prophet Enough
[1:40:00] Said So he says I want you to notice
[1:40:03] they got huy now watch this is the
[1:40:06] beginning of the Gentiles that's
[1:40:08] important when God dealt with them they
[1:40:11] got hoty in their heart and forced every
[1:40:13] man to worship the image of a holy man
[1:40:15] and the Gentile age was issued in with
[1:40:17] that now see he's back there under
[1:40:19] Nimrod coming out of the flood on the
[1:40:21] other side of the flood remember in
[1:40:22] Shiner they build a tower all right so
[1:40:25] he says that's how it came in that was
[1:40:27] the burgeoning of Gentiles around the
[1:40:29] world came from the sons of hamf sham
[1:40:31] and japheth so he says it came in that
[1:40:34] way it will go out the same it will go
[1:40:37] out in the same way the same way a
[1:40:40] boycott the mark of the beast that's
[1:40:42] what Nimrod did if you haven't read
[1:40:44] hislop's Two Babylons it is a
[1:40:46] fascinating read tremendous book really
[1:40:49] makes it connects all the dots and and
[1:40:52] and explains everything and so so he
[1:40:55] goes on to say they will force people
[1:40:58] now he's talking he said this is started
[1:41:00] it's going to end the same way came in
[1:41:02] under a force it's going to go out the
[1:41:04] Gentiles out under a
[1:41:07] force it's uh they will force people to
[1:41:10] worship and to do things that they've
[1:41:12] been taught that was contrary to the
[1:41:14] word of God and brother it'll be so
[1:41:17] slick and Sly it will deceive the very
[1:41:19] elect if possible so you better purpose
[1:41:21] in your heart tonight to be and be
[1:41:24] filled with Theo with God's holy spirit
[1:41:27] that you'll be able to discern the right
[1:41:29] and wrong thing when the proclamation is
[1:41:31] issued he comes later at the end of 1956
[1:41:35] in December says in the message titled
[1:41:37] Abraham now Abraham was just an ordinary
[1:41:40] man that come down with his father
[1:41:41] perhaps his father might have been an
[1:41:43] idolator because they came from Babylon
[1:41:44] and that first Babylon was called the
[1:41:47] gate to heaven and next was called
[1:41:50] confusion because of nimrod and this
[1:41:53] might hurt just a little bit he says he
[1:41:56] says I'm going to say it did you notice
[1:41:57] Nimrod was the first man to begin
[1:42:00] organization that's right and the first
[1:42:02] ones this side of Calvary was the
[1:42:05] Catholic Church still Babylon carrying
[1:42:07] on Babylon appears in the first of the
[1:42:09] Bible the middle of the Bible and the
[1:42:11] last of the Bible and every cult and
[1:42:14] everything that we have today if you
[1:42:16] watch the nature of it and go back in
[1:42:19] history of HPS to Babylons and many
[1:42:21] things back there and watch each one of
[1:42:22] those seeds was planted in Genesis
[1:42:26] Genesis is the beginning it's the seed
[1:42:28] book of the Bible watch these Cults
[1:42:30] today how many how they move and how
[1:42:32] they act and go right back in Genesis
[1:42:35] and find out if it didn't start right
[1:42:38] off that same way and now now we're in
[1:42:42] Harvest
[1:42:44] Time Of
[1:42:49] Everything 1958 the Oneness of unity now
[1:42:53] in the Tower of Babylon if you'll notice
[1:42:55] that Tower it was the beginning Babylon
[1:42:58] which I will speak on a little later
[1:43:00] this week the Lord willing the Lord will
[1:43:02] Babylon the very city was patterned out
[1:43:04] of heaven and in there they had the
[1:43:07] river Euphrates flowing right by the
[1:43:09] throne in the garden swinging uh
[1:43:10] swinging garden and that's patterned off
[1:43:13] of Heaven for the for the River of Life
[1:43:16] flows by The Throne of God and you see
[1:43:18] the achievement that man was doing was
[1:43:21] making a pattern perver verted see and
[1:43:24] so God comes down and he confounds
[1:43:29] them confounds their language confound
[1:43:32] their speech they were not only just of
[1:43:34] the same dialect but they were actually
[1:43:37] in one mind and one Accord that's why
[1:43:39] the Old Testament uses two separate
[1:43:41] Hebrew words they were of the same
[1:43:43] speech and of the same language which
[1:43:46] one was the same dialect and the other
[1:43:48] one was the same purpose they had one
[1:43:50] goal one heart they were in one mind and
[1:43:53] one Accord in a fallen condition and and
[1:43:57] now God is going to come down and use a
[1:44:00] tactic that appears to be out of Satan's
[1:44:02] Playbook he's going to be put confusion
[1:44:05] on them and break that power of their
[1:44:08] faith which God said they've begun to do
[1:44:11] this and now nothing can be restrained
[1:44:13] they've broken into a secret I got a sin
[1:44:16] confusion now the devil saw that and
[1:44:17] said okay I'll use that in in the future
[1:44:20] but when it came into an open into an
[1:44:22] upper room
[1:44:23] God returned that back to his people
[1:44:26] they were in one mind and one Accord and
[1:44:29] now the Holy Spirit came down and now
[1:44:31] they became a direct extension of
[1:44:34] almighty God back in the earth and and
[1:44:36] God was now in flesh again walking the
[1:44:42] Earth
[1:44:44] see so if so if then that was lost in
[1:44:48] the Dark Ages and God has restored it
[1:44:51] back in this hour when did he do it
[1:44:54] right when the cycle is about to finish
[1:44:56] and the same way the Gentiles came in
[1:44:59] that's the same way they're going out
[1:45:00] and it's forcing the whole world to
[1:45:02] worship it and it's it's it's it's
[1:45:04] ostracizing you if you don't agree with
[1:45:07] its nonsensical thinking on both sides
[1:45:09] of the aisle I'm neither one of those
[1:45:11] I'm a Christian I'm a Son of God and I
[1:45:14] realize I'm coming to a climax and the
[1:45:17] word is coming down upon me to do what
[1:45:20] lift you up into another world
[1:45:24] hallelu brother brandham says now watch
[1:45:28] God confounded them there in
[1:45:30] Genesis and brother brandham talks about
[1:45:32] that in at the in the bride he says in
[1:45:34] the leot and church age yes
[1:45:37] sir now watch I'm GNA label this for
[1:45:41] you the
[1:45:43] church is no
[1:45:45] longer now that's past history they're
[1:45:49] no longer so now he's in the past the
[1:45:53] church is no longer the mouthpiece of
[1:45:56] God meaning they used to be he winked at
[1:45:59] their ignorance and let them be even
[1:46:00] though they had false teachings they
[1:46:02] were still God's people just like Paul
[1:46:05] said you Jews that was fine you had the
[1:46:07] law and the the the animal sacrifice
[1:46:09] that was fine God winked at your
[1:46:10] ignorance he didn't you didn't know any
[1:46:12] better he didn't tell you he Christ
[1:46:14] hadn't come the lamb hadn't come you
[1:46:15] couldn't get the Holy Ghost God
[1:46:17] understood but now he requires all you
[1:46:20] Jews to come into repentance you've got
[1:46:23] to repent you've got to come to the word
[1:46:25] of your day and receive it go ahead and
[1:46:29] keep offering animal sacrifices it won't
[1:46:32] help
[1:46:33] you but we've been doing this for 1600
[1:46:36] years same thing they say today we've
[1:46:38] got the traditions of the father going
[1:46:40] all the way back to the Reformation fine
[1:46:42] great that worked great up until a
[1:46:44] certain point but once the word came
[1:46:47] flesh again in this hour that no longer
[1:46:50] you can't find Redemption under those
[1:46:52] kinds of pro programs anymore you might
[1:46:54] find Salvation from destruction the
[1:46:56] foolish virgin are saved but they still
[1:46:58] go in the tribulation period but I'm not
[1:47:01] looking for a tribulation period why
[1:47:03] would I when Jesus already went there
[1:47:05] for me why would I go in the tribulation
[1:47:08] and be judged when I'm already judged in
[1:47:13] Christ see so they're no longer the
[1:47:17] mouthpiece of God that's pasted it it
[1:47:20] the church it is its own mouth pieace
[1:47:23] that's present and this is
[1:47:26] 1965 the end of his
[1:47:29] ministry the church is no longer the
[1:47:31] mouthpiece of God that's one it is its
[1:47:35] own mouthpiece that's two so God is
[1:47:40] turning on her
[1:47:43] turning he didn't say he's done this is
[1:47:46] 1965 said he's turning on
[1:47:49] her so now you've got a cycle unfolding
[1:47:54] he
[1:47:55] will will this is
[1:47:58] forward confound her just like God did
[1:48:01] in Genesis he will confound her through
[1:48:05] the prophet and the
[1:48:08] bride now the prophet has already did
[1:48:11] his work what's
[1:48:17] left where's the Book of
[1:48:20] Life the bride ate that book The Book of
[1:48:24] Life is in her see for the voice of God
[1:48:30] will be in her see there it is in the
[1:48:33] future so so he he says yes it is for it
[1:48:37] says in the last chapter of Revelation
[1:48:39] verse 17 the spirit and the bride say
[1:48:45] come so so a real time
[1:48:50] parallel will be in effect
[1:48:53] God is changing and transitioning he's
[1:48:57] getting a we say well are are we not
[1:48:59] completely perfected we are in Christ
[1:49:02] but if we had finished all of our
[1:49:04] assignments we'd already be
[1:49:05] gone and since you're not gone the world
[1:49:08] can't be destroyed so God must still be
[1:49:11] finding other people even outside of the
[1:49:13] message of the hour so that even if they
[1:49:15] go through the tribulation they won't
[1:49:17] take the mark of the beast he's got this
[1:49:19] so figured out oh my goodness he's got
[1:49:22] this is so figured out he's brilliant
[1:49:24] he's brilliant God is a genius of all
[1:49:28] Geniuses a rest little bride rest all is
[1:49:32] well and he's changing me he's
[1:49:35] transitioning me the bride is has been
[1:49:38] becoming his final voice for all of
[1:49:40] these decades and he says once more the
[1:49:43] world will hear direct from God as at
[1:49:47] Pentecost but of course that word bride
[1:49:51] will be repudiated in in the as in the
[1:49:54] first age so I'm here to tell you
[1:49:56] friends the repudiation is right when
[1:49:59] the voice of God is the clearest and
[1:50:02] we've never had a time when the message
[1:50:05] and the bride are being so repudiated
[1:50:08] like they were in the early church and I
[1:50:10] just say blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:50:12] fill up the cup of iniquity please go
[1:50:15] ahead do it as fast as you can I'd very
[1:50:19] much like to be in a final transition
[1:50:21] I'd very much like to go from negative
[1:50:23] to positive and I don't ever have to
[1:50:25] come back to this negative
[1:50:28] again
[1:50:30] Hallelujah see when brother Brandon was
[1:50:34] saying this at the end of 1965 we were
[1:50:36] still decades away well really we were
[1:50:39] even more than half a century away but
[1:50:42] no one knew that
[1:50:45] see I'm here to tell you
[1:50:48] friends can I say it to you this way I
[1:50:50] hope you'll believe me I me I'm here to
[1:50:52] tell
[1:50:53] you we're not still decades
[1:51:00] away I'm here to tell you we're not
[1:51:03] decades away anymore I don't even know
[1:51:07] how to explain the level of blindness
[1:51:10] for anyone who can't see that we have
[1:51:14] arrived at the climax of human
[1:51:18] history the world's
[1:51:21] insanity and I and and I've been
[1:51:23] continuing to finish my audio book uh by
[1:51:28] the I played you an excerpt of it here
[1:51:30] and never has it been more clear to me
[1:51:34] when she's interviewing all of these
[1:51:36] Admirals and secretaries of defense and
[1:51:38] these men who are now in their old age
[1:51:41] and there and she's got direct quotes
[1:51:43] from them from the 70s 80s 90s 2000s the
[1:51:45] teens all the way up to now and she's
[1:51:48] still she's the only one Annie Jacobs
[1:51:50] Jacobson she's the only one they'll talk
[1:51:51] to and tell her all of these secrets
[1:51:53] because they know they can trust her
[1:51:55] they know she won't out them till it's
[1:51:56] safe to do so and she and and I'm at a
[1:51:59] point now where all she's basically
[1:52:01] doing is reading direct quotes from
[1:52:03] these people and I said to my wife I was
[1:52:05] listening going down the road the other
[1:52:07] day and I turned off I said sweetheart I
[1:52:09] said I see more clearly than I ever have
[1:52:12] before why brother brandham said it'll
[1:52:15] only take one
[1:52:19] madman you don't realize how the world
[1:52:21] is hanging by a hair's thread to nuclear
[1:52:25] Annihilation and you don't see it cuz
[1:52:27] life just goes on and wall Street's
[1:52:29] still working and they're still running
[1:52:30] an election and they still got this
[1:52:31] going on and there's Wars over here and
[1:52:33] this is happening but let me tell you
[1:52:34] something friends bring your head up out
[1:52:37] of the sand look around you the world is
[1:52:40] falling apart it's only going to take
[1:52:42] one mad man and they've got plenty of
[1:52:44] Mad Men they're all over the world and
[1:52:47] it only takes one and the world's
[1:52:48] covered with them and you've got mad men
[1:52:50] saying they're going to annihilate
[1:52:51] Israel and Israel
[1:52:53] Israel is a nuclear power and these
[1:52:55] people are how's that going to work for
[1:52:57] you you're going to annihilate them
[1:52:58] really you think they're going to you're
[1:52:59] going to annihilate them and then you're
[1:53:01] not going to get annihilated then when
[1:53:02] that happens friends I don't even know
[1:53:04] how it's going to all unfold I know that
[1:53:06] I'll be at a table thousands of miles
[1:53:08] long
[1:53:11] Hallelujah but we have arrived the
[1:53:13] climax of human history all things are
[1:53:16] ready now the Earth is poised for self
[1:53:18] Annihilation like never ever before and
[1:53:22] the bride is being repudiated and we're
[1:53:25] not decades we're not decades away I
[1:53:29] want you to know it's happening right
[1:53:31] now it's happening in real time it's
[1:53:34] happening we're not decades away we're
[1:53:36] not I don't even believe we're years
[1:53:37] away I believe that right now we could
[1:53:39] see a news headline by tomorrow of these
[1:53:42] things moving into motion and we already
[1:53:45] know that can't go to Annihilation so
[1:53:47] long as we're
[1:53:50] here going to read you this final quote
[1:53:53] before I
[1:53:55] close so brother brandham says in the
[1:53:57] future home this is where we've been
[1:53:59] studying the future home of the Heavenly
[1:54:02] bridegroom and the Earthly
[1:54:05] bride and he says see you become a new
[1:54:10] person not just an old one patched up by
[1:54:13] joining church or trying to turn a new
[1:54:16] page but you are a complete brand new
[1:54:21] unit
[1:54:28] if I call up Chris and say Chris I need
[1:54:32] a new AC I need I need a M's put I need
[1:54:37] a brand new unit he's not going to come
[1:54:39] out and rebuild mine and say Dad I gave
[1:54:41] you a brand new unit he's going to
[1:54:44] remove the old one and set a brand new
[1:54:46] one in its
[1:54:47] place and so brother R says you are a
[1:54:51] brand new
[1:54:52] unit you're not an old one patched up
[1:54:56] God takes the old man and burns him
[1:55:00] completely out with the Holy Ghost and
[1:55:03] Fire and comes himself sends down your
[1:55:10] representation I almost had a Runway
[1:55:13] just thinking about that he sent down my
[1:55:16] representation he sent down something
[1:55:19] that was kin to me he sent down the Holy
[1:55:21] Spirit and I so happened that the real
[1:55:23] me that lives on the inside is part of
[1:55:25] that Hallelujah he says he sends down
[1:55:29] your representation no man can come to
[1:55:31] me he's quoting Jesus in Luke 4 no or I
[1:55:34] mean Luke nine I think no man can come
[1:55:36] to me except my father has draw him and
[1:55:39] all the father has given me will come to
[1:55:41] me you see it same plan same way Satan
[1:55:45] was watch this now friends you want to
[1:55:46] you want a jubilee watch Satan will be
[1:55:50] taken from the Earth
[1:55:52] just exactly like Satan was taken from
[1:55:55] you Satan cannot bother he can tempt but
[1:55:59] he cannot get a born- again Christian
[1:56:01] for God from the foundation of the world
[1:56:04] forsaw him and sent Jesus to redeem him
[1:56:08] and the blood speaks for him how can he
[1:56:11] sin when it can't be seen even by God
[1:56:16] the only thing he hears is your voice he
[1:56:19] sees your representation amen that is
[1:56:22] true by the same means for the world is
[1:56:26] watch this now I'm on I'm on the last
[1:56:28] little paragraph I'm going to make these
[1:56:30] closing
[1:56:32] statements for the world is one of his
[1:56:36] attributes just the same as you are one
[1:56:39] of his
[1:56:41] attributes this is why you're considered
[1:56:43] in Redemption this is why you are more
[1:56:46] than just saved from
[1:56:49] destruction this is why you believe the
[1:56:51] word this is why why you have the Holy
[1:56:53] Ghost you're entitled to it
[1:56:55] see so he
[1:56:58] says for the world is one of his
[1:57:01] attributes just the same as you are one
[1:57:03] of his
[1:57:03] attributes the world becomes one of his
[1:57:07] attributes because it was God's thinking
[1:57:11] in the beginning to have a
[1:57:14] world to be on a
[1:57:16] throne to be a king to be a redeemer to
[1:57:21] be a
[1:57:22] healer j s s that's his
[1:57:28] attributes so why do I believe in a
[1:57:32] redeemer and a Healer and a king and a
[1:57:36] kingdom because those are part of his
[1:57:40] attributes and I'm part of his
[1:57:43] attributes Hallelujah to believe that
[1:57:47] he's a Healer and a king is native to me
[1:57:52] I say Amen to the word I'm speaking my
[1:57:54] native
[1:57:56] language Hallelujah friends it's not a
[1:57:59] simulation I'm not living in a dream I'm
[1:58:02] being blended into another
[1:58:05] world Hallelujah and it's happening
[1:58:08] right now it's happening right
[1:58:10] now Hallelujah like Simeon I found the
[1:58:17] Christ in his word I've taken it up into
[1:58:21] my arms
