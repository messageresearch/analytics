bless you amen we're happy to have y'all here with us tonight we're running up our skeleton crew again tonight uh just trying to mitigate a situation that we ran into last week and so we ran last sunday and we're running this evening on the um just a skeleton crew we've got a few musicians here and some broadcast personnel and uh sashandra good to have you with us i knew you'd tag long amen happy to have brother diggs and his daughter with us here tonight and the different ones of you he's going to be coming to preach for us just in a few minutes and i just wanted to make a couple of announcements we hope to by the help of the lord all things going forward as as they are and the way we expect them to continue we should be able to meet back here all of us with open service on the first sunday of the new year in january now these are uncertain times and strange and unsettling times so we'll just have to keep you updated but i've been trying to do that i've been trying to be very faithful to keep the church informed uh just to let you understand that all the decisions that are made regarding that are made in group with all of the ministry and officers teams i've been in a lot of discussion with them and you know there's a a very very good honest open dialogue as to what we're facing what we should do what should be our response so at this time it's my tentative plan to have the service back for everybody uh come the third of january and i hope we're able to do that i expect that we will um and i hope that that will carry through i will keep you posted so please just keep a track on the church um whatsapp that goes out to the whole assembly that's where i will post anything just a reminder tonight that if you have any prayer requests send them to me personally via whatsapp or sms and i'll get them here on my device amen and um we're happy to have brother diggs you might just let him know we're ready for him brother matthew and um we're happy to have him here tonight this is uh you won't see him again until next year amen so this is uh the last time we'll that uh we're going to give him a chance to come out and beat the devil's brains out amen amen huh i've always referred to brother diggs as the weapon and he's he's the weapon that i bring in here to give the devil a good thumping amen so we appreciate that and i know that he knows it's a compliment amen amen the enemy fears him that's for sure but we love him we love brother diggs here he's been ministering for us he comes once a month we've kind of been doing that since uh probably the last year and a half and we have been the happy beneficiaries of that now tonight we've got him a little bit on a little bit of corral well not a corral he's welcome to preach on whatever's on his heart but we've got him on a little bit of at least short lease time wise because i want to be able to come up behind him before we dismiss when we take up the prayer request and i've got just some other things that i'd like to say that are on my heart i'd like to say to you the whole the whole assembly who are home uh streaming tonight and if they're not catching it live i'm hoping hoping they will catch it then on the archive but just some things that i want to um talk about give you a little bit of an idea about the upcoming year the things that's in my heart and the ministry team and things that we want to do kind of a vision for the year the reason i want to do it tonight is because i don't want to spend any of my precious preaching time on that first sunday doing it so we're going to try to take a little bit so we've asked brother diggs to uh you know hold it back just a little bit tonight and then that'll give me now we want the holy ghost to take his liberty so i know what i said but what i said is subject to change of what he says and so whatever time you leave me i'll just use whatever time that is but brother diggs is a pro and a veteran he knows he understands how that goes but we'll let the holy ghost have liberty tonight we'll definitely take up your prayer requests we want to pray for any of your needs so if you have them feel free to send them in to me and we will catch those at the end want to pray for everything that everybody sends in and then i will take a few minutes at the end and just kind of speak to you a little bit you know kind of a state of the church state of the union thing but i won't take long but just want to deliver my heart on this last service we were supposed to have communion service tonight we had to push that off we'll push it off into into january we will get to that i want to start doing that more often that's one of the things we want to talk about tonight but god bless you we want to invite brother diggs to come now and just take his liberty amen in the lord only believe again sister dead oh only believe that all things [Music] oh believe all things are possible holy belief hey man it's good to be here again we certainly appreciate pastor jason amen and all of you and just real brief i can say that all of you have been such a blessing to me you know um god is just good there's nothing like being around saints of light precious faith and i've been very encouraged you know just fellowshipping with brother jason and all of you and the saints of god those i see and don't see you know just your prayers and everything has been very very helpful so we just love god amen let's just have a word of prayer and we'll get right into the word of god lord jesus father we're here tonight lord and as we often say that we're here on the merits of your grace lord lord knowing that it's nothing we've done but it's all your choosing lord lord before the foundation of the world you saw us here in bethel tabernacle lord you've seen it in different conditions we would be around lord but that doesn't stop the word of god from going forth so lord we pray that tonight lord you have total preeminence lord in me and in both listen in the lord jesus and speaker lord god that this service would lift you up and edify your holy name lord and just ask father you forgive us for our sins and trespasses lord and the things that no one else sees but you father keep us under your atoning blood because it's that blood that keeps us protected lord lord it's that blood that keeps your hand of grace in our lives so lord we love you and we appreciate for the sacrifice of your life in the name of jesus christ we pray the church amen amen if you have your bibles amen we appreciate all the songs let's go to um genesis the first chapter genesis chapter 1. blessed be the name of the lord familiar verse of scriptures genesis chapter 1 verse 26. the bible says and god said let us make man in our image after our likeness and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea over the fowl of the air over the cattle over the earth and over every creeping thing that created upon the earth so god created man in his own image in the image of god created he him male and female amen let's go to matthew chapter 27. matthew 27. matthew 27 and verse verse 50. matthew 27 and 50 the bible says jesus when he had cried again with a loud voice yielded up the ghost and behold the veil of the temple was rent and twain from top to bottom and the earth did quake and the rocks rent and the graves were open and many bodies of the saints which slept arose and came out of the graves after his resurrection and went into the holy city and appeared unto many and maybe the lord blessing to the reading of his word amen you have your seats you know tonight by the grace of god real briefly i want to use for a subject back in position amen back in position church i know that we're in a time where everything seems very shaky you know one minute we're in church one minute without a church one minute healings in the land one minute sickness is in hand in the land but one thing i want us to realize that we live and move and have our being in christ you know so although we we operate according to the things of the land that's not our position amen our position is in the revelation of jesus christ you know but i i want to i want to deal with this you know simply for what it is you know the prophet of god he said that we are amateur creators we are uh if you could say it like this we are we are god's mini me hallelujah we are his meaning me you know it's like a man who has a a son and and when you see when you see his son you see the attributes of that father and that son hallelujah now you can't say you you can say this you say man you look just like your dad you don't say to the dad you look just like your son because that son came from the father the father didn't come from the sun oh yeah so anything about that son the resemblance of it everything comes from his father hallelujah so church in this day we're in god clearly from the beginning he made man in his own image hallelujah that's our position hallelujah our position is not sickness our position is not sadness our position is not corona our position is not heartache and pain our position is the image of god in his likeness in his strength in his faith in his holiness everything about him hey we are in his likeness hollywood in church it behooves us in this time in this hour hallelujah to get back in position because in your position there is power hallelujah why adam was look we know and you know i'ma hit the highlights and listen you can go back and study you know i'ma say some things that we we know and we heard but sometimes it's good to be refreshed hallelujah one one thing i like about the story of david and saul the bible says when david came and he played the instrument and cast out the demons that was in saul's life the bible says and saul was refreshed what was it david was in his position hurry up see his position had the power to refresh somebody that was being tormented by demons hallelujah and you and your position have the power to breathe for the refreshing hallelujah no matter what's going on in your position there is power hallelujah church a husband in his position there is power a wife there's power children there are power hallelujah in your position now you look church god made everything else first you know he made the boom the stars you know the heavens he heard and then he came and he started making creation on the natural earth to put it in the earth he made fish and all the animals and all these things and then he made a man holly he made a man last he was the last thing you made but it was the strongest all right it was the best hallelujah why because that was the only thing that could fully resemble god praise the lord you say well lamb is the type of god an eagle is a type of god a lion is a type of god but church what was the first type wow according to the scriptures the first type was a man hallelujah he said i created man in my own image and likeness harlow and he gave that man dominion that was his position his position was to control all right what about your situation are you controlling it or is something else controlling it you hurry up as one of god's many me you have the power to control it there wasn't a situation in the bible that jesus didn't control amen he went to the death of lazarus and controlled it hallelujah oh church there's a place in the scripture where they said they wanted to throw jesus off a cliff hallelujah he controlled that situation why because there was no scripture saying that he was going to die of a cliff holy when you know who you are and you're in your position you can control your what's going on the church look at that man that man in his position the prophet of god saying he could control the trees he tell a tree get up from the east wing and go west hallelujah that's the power he had he had the power of the spoken word why because he was a god now i'm going to say something you know the prophet say when he was talking about man be omnipotent he said i was gonna choke it he said what i'ma say it man was created to be omnipotent that's your position tonight amen that's your position to be all powerful omnipotent that's your position in adam's position everything had to obey him adam was so much like god he went to creation and told creation what it was amen in his position that's right but you look church adam he lost his position he lost the position in the fall he did something god told him not to do he willfully did it he lost his position but he didn't lose hallelujah his true identity think about the church you can lose your position but you'll never lose your true identity see he just had spiritual amnesia he was always a adam hallelujah glory he was always a son he was always a god hallelujah there was just something that took place within his own human spirit see what happens when you live like a human you live with spiritual amnesia amen i don't want to be a human all right i want to be a son of god as a son of god there's a certain thing that comes along with that title and we know in that position when adam lost his position he lost the authority hollywood to believe in what god made him to be now i want you to catch this even though harley he fell in the sin he still was a son even the prophet of god said even in the fallen condition they're still sons and daughters of god because god is the only one that can create hallelujah so in that condition hallelujah adam being out of position he still was what god said he is that's why god had to bring a message in this day hollywood because that was the only thing that could put us back in position hallelujah hungry without this message we will be living a revelation of part knowing from the beginning he said you are in my image and my likeness hallelujah so he had to bring something to restore that image and that likeness he had to do something to put man fully back in position hallelujah now what i love about the story of adam because he was a god hallelujah he walked away with a memory of knowing what it was like to be a god wow holy anybody ever been blessed and you remember what it's like to be blessed if you were ever sick and were healed you got a memory of what it's like to be healed hallelujah see there's something god put in us that we will never forget where we came from that's right amen now you think about adam walking out of that garden he's leaving that garden with a memory of the position he was in yeah think about it today he had to work hard and he had he had to kill the ground and do all these things he was doing all that with a memory of man i used to be a god i used to speak the creation it did whatever whatever whatever i said to her i didn't have to worry about the animals they were my pets the lions was my pets the tiger was my pet hallelujah everything was his pet called in his position he controlled his surroundings and you and your position you have the authority and power to control your surroundings you say brother jesus why are you preaching like this because i want you to go into the new year hallelujah not accepting defeat i want you to go to the new year with your hand hop your head up high saying i am a son i am a daughter and it's time for me to get in my position so the whole world earth and creation can recognize who i am when i get in my position church read your bible when jesus hallelujah in his position as a redeemer when he died the whole world took notice even the unbelievers took notice even the grave death [Music] church the bible says see jesus knew he had to redeem mankind and we're going somewhere we just see this tonight it's like what we grew up on my daughter don't know about us we grew up on pac-man pac-man and pac woman and what they would do they would run from ghosts until they got a power pellet that power pellet meant everything once they get that power pellet the ghost started running why pac-man was impositioned in wow pac woman was in position there and then the ghosts recognized who they were chasing once you get hallelujah that power pellet called the holy ghost the ghost will run from you i heard a brother say one time hallelujah he said when i dream i'm the nightmare in my dream hallelujah devils don't torment me i'm the nightmare in my dream amen see when you know who you are look it's clear it's clear the prophet of god said jesus was walking in a frail body about 135 pounds but the demons recognized who he was not according to his flesh according to his spirit hallelujah they looked at that little body hallelujah and they said we know who thou art even though he left the throne and came and took on a body of sin he still was god showing us who we are when you know who you are the demons recognize who you are in your position amen oh my but adam lost all that so god said huh i'm not gonna settle for this i'm gonna put man back where they're supposed to be i'm gonna put you i'm gonna put bethel tabernacle where they supposed to be i'm gonna put them back in position hallelujah how did he do it he said i'm gonna give my life hallelujah look he tucked away harlow you took away the sacrifice of bulls and ghosts and he became the supreme sacrifice because he know once you got in position and accepted christ as your as your sacrifice that put you back to genesis 1 26 that's why the temple was rent from top to bottom hallelujah and everything took notice that god had redeemed the whole world church you have to realize what god does don't get nervous about the clothes what god does he pushes us back into our position because sometimes we don't even realize what's in us he had to push the prophet into speaking squirrels and he was right in the midst of it hallelujah one two of them he right in the midst of it still doubting and god had to push him some more come on let's put that first quote up so i can get out of the way this isn't a message i know hallelujah he says every christian believer i know i know yeah those are upside down i mean yeah yeah that's it that's it yeah he says every christian believer has to be pushed into those trials look god pushes us into trials think about that so even when i'm going through something god got his hand on me and it may look like it's something crazy it may look like something ridiculous it might even look like i'm saying but the problem god said is god pushing me into a trial what is he doing putting me in position [Applause] oh i feel my helper coming up i'm sorry cameraman 10 people 20 people 100 people hey man listen he says every christian believer do we have christian believers here tonight will you say birthdays my bills behind god's hand is behind you yeah you say oh my family messed up god's hand is pushing you he said oh i'm a little sick in my body god's hand is on your back pushing the devil ain't doing nothing he says every christian believer has to be pushed into those trials every christian listen to the reason why listen he says every christian believer has to be put on the ash heap so that they can come forth with an experience amen that's why tongs is not the evidence experiences the evidence he says pushed on the ash heap so that he can come forth with an experience i know my redeemer liveth hallelujah so you mean god to take us through things just to unveil more of himself in our life earlier so we can know who he is in deeper depths hallelujah and i'll give you a key when you know who he is you definitely know who you are [Applause] amen and when god pushes us pushes us to believe into a trial then we walk out with experience saying i know my regime are living i know my god got my back i know my god on my side i know my god is a healer i know my god is righteous i know my god's deliverer i know my god is faithful that's what the child is all about putting you back in position where you can never doubt god amen luke church before the fall adam didn't have any doubt amen and amen taking a step further even his act doing the fall shows he didn't have no doubt because the bible the prophet said he willfully sinned so he knew he wasn't being deceived he knew the day he partook of he was going to die hallelujah but him being a type of god as a redeemer he injected his seed into his wife so she couldn't die because god couldn't kill himself see in his position he was a redeemer even in his wrong adam was typing out god in his position why because he was created in the image of god all he could do is redeem wow [Music] all you can do is save hallelujah and adam willfully sending save e delivered eve and in the midst of all that and he brought forth life [Music] all in his position my sea church our childhood tribulations are there to bring forth something that says i know my redeemer living your trial is not that you may backslide no no god is not the other confusion he has a purpose in everything he does holly little church it's like a baby you take a baby and as that baby grows and grows and grows i believe my my baby girl kiara started walking at nine months you know so as she grew and ate food and grew she got to a place and y'all had seen babies do this she got to a place where she would crawl and this should use her own strength and pull up on something and just stand there not even knowing she can walk wow the ability was already in her she just had to be coached and pushed into it hallelujah now to push from a parent to that baby hallelujah is gonna produce some falls but it's for her or his good hallelujah that push is for the good hallelujah because once they fall hallelujah i remember when i was when i was when i was a kid i was playing football and i loved to play football but my first initial introduction to football we had to put the pads on and all the stuff i was 10 years old we put the pads on and all that stuff and i was worried about somebody hitting me and y'all i got hit and i didn't feel anything and i was like oh oh so you mean i can run full speed and ram somebody and ain't gonna feel anything oh man i like this boy hallelujah i love this hallelujah why holy i didn't feel nothing hallelujah so i could give a little bit more i could give a little bit more effort hallelujah and church as a child falls really when it's falling what's happening is it's increasing its balance it takes a fall to increase your foundation to increase your stability hallelujah so as that child falls hallelujah it learns with every step hallelujah how to balance itself why because they remember what it's like to fall god pushes us so the real potential in you can come out and you know before you know it one parent is you know behind i don't know if it was you bro jason i know me i was behind my girls and boys standing there just just in case they fail they'll fall in my arms church if we fall we're christian believers we're falling into the arms of god hallelujah and all he's going to do is pick us back up and say try it again pick us back up and try it again that's why the bible says a righteous man fallen seven times but he gets back up again that's what makes him righteous he gets back up to try again he doesn't wallow into it holy the bible says in that same verse of scripture that talks about the sinful man he goes into mischief when he falls but church listen like i said like the baby the baby falls and as it's falling it's really increasing this balance hallelujah so then it gets to a place hallelujah before it falls the balance kicks in it kicks into a place to walking becomes normal yeah there you go remember walking used to be a child it used to be a child to that baby it used to be something he was scared of it used to be something that would hurt it but then he gets a place in his position where it becomes the master of walking in this position he becomes the master of every step in [Music] church when we go through uh if i could say it the prophet of god said if you want uh acorns if you want a acorn tree he said i give you the seed of acorns you potentially got the tree yeah amen same thing with apples and you want an apple tree if i give you apple c potentially you got to see i mean you got you got the tree he typed the holy ghost with the same thing yeah hallelujah he said the holy ghost is your earnest of heaven hallelujah he said the holy ghost i didn't have time to give it to your brothers he said the holy ghost is the earnest of the power of the same thing that rules jesus about the grave amen so if you've got the holy ghost there will always be a resurrection in your life he said the holy ghost is the earnest of everything that jesus promised and he also said the holy ghost is the earnest of your inheritance hallelujah so you mean to tell me if i got the holy ghost that means i have already got a portion of heaven [Applause] if i got the holy ghost healing his mind if i got the holy ghost salvation is mine if i got the holy ghost joy is mine if i got the holy ghost my children are mine amen if i got the holy ghost the blessings are mine it's the earliest hallelujah just like he said with a loaf of bread he said you want to buy some bread nowadays about 2.50 i know what kind of bread you buy but i buy um nature's nature's own yeah right honey wheat and you know it's about too far that's somewhere in there you know as long as i can walk if i walk in walmart food line wherever you go if i walk in there and i got 2.40 i'm coming out with nature's own yeah why because that 240 is my earnest king doesn't stop it they can look at me they can say you look crazy whatever kind of clothes i got on but as long as i got that earnest as long as i long that money is in position hallelujah they got to give me what i'm purchasing and the holy ghost is your purchase of the rapture church don't get distraught we are right where god wants to be amen think about it god put you in a age with sicknesses and diseases with no cure god put you in an age where sodom and gomorrah is back on the earth god puts you in an age where noah's day is back on the earth why because he's soon to come if you can see her thank god for covet because that means god is close [Music] the scriptures are being fulfilled see everything is getting in position what about you amen that's right amen listen with sons and daughters give me the last quote bro listen he says which is this what you got to do he says which is it an angel is a servant we are sons and daughters you know what god is doing he's adopting us see your position is about your adoption he says which is the most he said which is the most thought of your servant or your son or your daughter oh my listen to this prayer from a saint will go a million times higher than an angel and the prophet says yes sir can i get somebody to say yes sir yes sir amen oh my i'mma change it a little bit prayer from me will go a million miles million times higher than an angel do you believe yourself to be a saint do you believe yourself to be a son or a daughter according to god's vindicated prophet hallelujah he said our prayers go a million miles higher than a sinless angel an angel that's never done any wrong an angel that's never even had a bad thought amen but when you pray look at your position church amen praise god look at your position look where god put you god put you above the angels why because your sons you know what you are your family amen and like they always say blood is thicker than water hallelujah church he says prayer from a saint will go a million times higher than an angel yes sir because he's a son oh probably like where the prophecy probably said whoa yeah there you go that inspiration is coming to a prophet and he almost can't believe it you don't study for stuff like this it comes afresh it's god hunger reminding the people of their position [Applause] amen he can't pull the scripture out hey yeah well you can't put a scripture out to tell us that but that's what it is by inspiration amen he said that's right my brother my sister so church what i'm saying tonight is go into this new year in your position as a son as a daughter as the redeemer of the lord as genesis 1 26 hallelujah with the with the resemblance of matthew 27 hallelujah where god has come and he restored remember he said it was a threefold purpose hallelujah amen and you know one of those in there was he wanted to restore eden hallelujah and another one was he wanted to have the preeminence in the believer what was he doing god was getting back in position amen now he's the imposition in your life let's pray lord we thank you for your word yes and lord such a powerful word that you've given us lord to know that we're not just here as church people but we're your sons we're your daughters and lord even when we go through things it's the hand of god pushing us so we can learn how to keep our balance hallelujah lord you're guiding and you're leading and those who may fall you pick us up and push us again until we become the master of every step hallelujah and lord as that baby will walk it doesn't even have to look where it's going hallelujah it just takes a step in a step and a step until it arrives where it's supposed to be it'll help us lord to have the same faith to know lord that every step we take lord is a step of inspirational step of faith lord and we're leaning on the eternal hand of jehovah lord continue to bless this church lord the past his family his church family and all those connected lord in the name of jesus christ we pray good amen [Applause] oh my well was i right or was i right i'll tell you like brother jules says the devil done took a beating from that what a sermon friends to think about going into the new year i was just thinking about you know what better things could we hear to give us you know to to adjust our balance and our our reaction you know it's it's almost it's almost always your reaction that gets you in trouble not a lot of time your action because actions you know you can think it through and avoid it but sometimes you get caught off guard and you have the wrong reaction and you know a lot of times we we can see the things that are going on in the world today and uh hey deb come on back and uh sing that song for me uh brother matt why don't you come up to and help help us sing it and uh the rest of you can just stay right there and and uh i've asked sister debra to help me with a song i love it and uh one of my favorite songs i was learning some history about it tonight just blew my mind did you ever find out if that was in the time of taylor or you didn't you don't know yet you don't know or i don't know okay so amen it's quite an amazing song um that i've loved for years but we'll have her sing it just in a few minutes uh just get her in position amen but you know this the whole what a year man what a what a year we've had what i i was so glad to see 2020 in the rear view mirror now you say well brother jason you know how do you know 2021 will be any better i i don't expect it to be better but at least you know now i i think that we've come we've we've we've had enough falling and enough stumbling around that we've learned how to walk in these kinds of times i i so appreciate that i was this morning uh on my bible study with those brothers on the west coast and and uh different ones and brother dale was in there he started joining in with me and some brother jack from florida and there's some brothers from florida and man we're starting to get a nice little gang of brothers every morning and those west coast brothers have to get up at 4am to do that y'all remember brother esteban when he was here and he's one of those that is on there and we were talking about that very thing this morning about how that atom and it sounds it sounds upside down it sounds counter-intuitive to suggest that adam is a more complete son once he comes in contact with redemption having needing redeemed and gets redeemed he's a greater masterpiece than before he understands it see there was a time when adam brother branham called him god's masterpiece but in a sense he was because he was in the image of god but adam didn't know anything about sin adam didn't know anything about redeemer i didn't know anything about a healer and so god desiring to express his attributes and we find that adam and i love how that brother diggs just so nailed that down that adam with his eyes wide open knew that he was the son of god and he knew that if that if he gave his seed to this fallen woman god couldn't kill her because his seed the bible doesn't say adam was the son of god the bible says he was the son of god that's a pretty strong statement he was the son of god and there was nothing about adam that could be eternally separated from god think about that friends there is nothing that you could ever do in this life come what may you can never be eternally separated from god because you were always in him and brother branham says god's already seen the whole thing finished up he said it's finished up with god a long time ago in god's man god's understanding he's already got you on the other side already enjoying heavenly places my but here we are you know we got to go through the shadow of a life amen boy you left the preacher up here i better be careful oh my i have longed to be back in my pulpit i've been away for a little bit and i uh just wanted to give you a little bit of update so uh brother matt i think ends his quarantine if i'm not mistaken maybe tomorrow or friday i can't remember um his family sister rachel and the children have tested all tested negative i tested and tested negative and uh what i had obviously was just a head cold it was a there's actually a there was another you know head cold kind of a bug going around my daughter-in-law katie caught it and wondered if she had coveted she tested and tested negative so um all is well in our families brother matt's completely fully right his reign uh already you know been back full steam and so while we were we're we'll be able uh to be past all of that so i'm happy in the lord tonight and you know something friends this has been a we've called it over and over again you know just a strange year strange and unsettling time that we've been in but do you do you realize that they're already uh they knew it was coming and it's actually already been confirmed i think they had their first case in colorado either today or yes i think it was yesterday the day before where the covid 19 has already mutated it's already now a new more uh they think it's even more contagious now fortunately they're thinking that the vaccines they're developing if they work on the sars2 coveted 19 then it'll also work on this mutation but that always happens satan ain't never going to be finished till god finishes him amen you just remember that remember i told you in the beginning of the year of this year i said listen when this one's over there'll be five more behind that and and ten more behind those five that you have to get it through your head the world is burning down it's going into a tribulation you can't stay here it's time to get out and you know i want to see us be prepared we have a lot of things that we want to accomplish and i i find myself going into 2021 with the same astonishment and amazement that i went into 2020 with you know um never imagining in our you know and and and i can speak authoritatively because i'm you know a little bit unique in some regards to most of you here um i've been in this message my whole life i was raised up in it my mom and dad were as you know in the meetings and and i grew up in message churches and i can tell you i was i was in the circles growing up of uh the great the great warriors of yesteryear many of them most all of them going on now and uh you know even brother eddie included in that and none of them none of them imagined for a second that we would actually had here we are 20 years deep into the 21st century and it blows our minds but you know something we also at the same exact time we can look by bible prophecy and we can know that no other age has ever been so close to seeing every last prophecy before the coming of the lord completely fulfilled completely in place and i want to say to you and this may i would probably need a sermon just to qualify this statement i won't take the time tonight but maybe we'll get there sunday but i'm gonna tell you something friends here we are and it's 20 21 on the eve of it but i gotta say to you it makes sense to me i never saw it coming i you if you had to talk to me you know in in in the 1980s or 1990s or even in right around the turn of the century i'd have never saw it going to 2020 but now that i'm here headed into 2021 and i see what's happening in the world i see what's happening at every level whether it's politics or religion the ecumenical movement social conditions no entertainment industry no matter what you want to say and and the falling away even with people who uh who walked in the ranks of the message of the hour and and even the not just of falling away but a turning against and becoming an opposer of it that was unprecedented until this day you never had that back in the day i'm here to tell you that i see where we are now when i look back when i look at it in hindsight at my age i just say well i never expected it but i do get it i do get it and i want to tell you something there is not one single thing out of cater god has not lost control at all and fact is he is he is really demonstrating his greatness and his power and his control over his family more than in any other age because never has it age been so impossible for believers to stay spiritually minded and strong and to accomplish the word of god and yet here we are doing it here we are in an age of impossibility and yet god is doing more in us than we can even comprehend and even be aware of i am looking forward to 2021 i hope it's i hope that we never see 2022. amen i hope we would never see 2021 and i stand here tonight and i hope we won't see 2022 i wouldn't it be amazing to say 2021 would be the year that we've waited on and and and on that morning that i could wake up and and here's brother eddie back in my living room again and here's your loved ones back in the living room again and i realize and i look around and i see that i'm back young and i say the day i've waited for my whole life oh what a morning that's gonna be friends what a morning it gives me courage i feel more courage than i've ever felt yeah i feel more drive than i've ever felt and it should be the opposite i stand in astonishment i stand here in astonishment to say with what 2020 has been for me at a personal level and the trial and you're all as a church aware of the trial that sister debbie and i walked together hand in hand over the last half year and and here i stand on the backside of it and sister debbie completely recovered oh by the way the last thing that was to come was her sleeping uh was to come back where she where she could sleep without any assistance and she's sleeping like a baby i even got up this morning had to wake her up so she's doing good and uh you know when your nervous system gets that broken you know it can take a little while i'm quite sure she's still got some some internal healing but as far as all those symptoms i tell you the devil tries to irritate her with a little bit of a buzz in her tongue and and i think that's just the last little salt grain that's vanishing away amen but you know i just tell the devil all the time brother diggs i tell him all the time you ain't nobody satan you ain't nobody you're a puppet in the hands of my daddy my daddy is in control of my life my life as brother abraham myra always says we do not live by the mercies of satan by the mercies of lucifer we live by the mercies of jesus christ and i remind that you say you better be careful the devil might hear you say that i'm not i'm not trying to to you know i'm not trying to meet him on those kind of terms i'm not trying to you know face off with him in some street fight in a back alley i can't whip him but my my daddy can whip him and already did whip him and i know that my father has control of my life i'm only stating the obvious my life and my times are in his hands and i've already got the promise of the word that i win so why should i worry about losing if i'm already promised to win how crazy would that be yeah how crazy would it be to worry about losing when you have the promise that you're going to win amen how crazy would it be to take the word of the devil who's never been able to defeat the one who gave you the promise and god has never ever ever ever did i say ever he has never ever lost a battle to anything or anything and and every time satan has challenged him without the exception of even one time whenever he's challenged the holy ghost he's always lost amen and i tell you something friends when you realize that you are a part of god when you realize that you are actually included in the literal godhead reality of christ and brother branham taught us that so very clearly that that we literally are a part of him literally a part of god in that great equation that makes up god that's why that's why you're a believer because brother rahm said you believe the word because it's a part of you it's you haven't been persuaded into this nobody convinced you of it nobody can dissuade you from it nobody can convince you otherwise you're a believer even in things you don't understand because you know god said it that settles it i'm a believer i just believe it you know why you know why i believe it because that's what believers do they believe and with the trials of 2020 and with covid and and the ups and downs and the ins and outs and our church schedule on and off and you know we we were saying here recently that you know i said it to the church and i meant it quite seriously and i i so say i again tonight you know as a church and not just this church but churches around the world covet has taken something from us and i'm going to tell you something friends i want it back i want it back i want to i don't like seeing that people have lost ground and yet i do see that some and it's impossible not to lose ground i mean just while i was while i was in quarantine and couldn't even come here to this church just a couple of services i said to my wife i said i don't see how i do not see how people cannot have uh and come to church and hear the live preaching and have the fellowship of the saints and just be able to come here how do they even stay christians i don't even know just the power of god in their lives i'll give them credit man they they must have something more than me because i'm going to tell you something i have felt the impact of not standing here and let's say oh it's just a building brick and mortar and wood and chairs i get that friends but i'm going to tell you something god gathers here do you know how i know god gathers here because you gather here amen and not only does he promise to gather where two or three of you gather in his name but he gathers in you and you sitting here you are his family you are the bride the purchase the bride of the lord jesus christ that's no small thing don't let the devil you know devalue your heritage don't let him take that away from you as brother diggs was preaching on that tonight listen adam adam may have sinned and lost his position but he never lost his identity with god and i've said it before and i'll say it again tonight there is no earthly condition that can change your heavenly position you started in christ guess what you will finish in christ amen i believe that with all my heart we have a lot of things that we want to do in 2021 and i've you know i've made some adjustments uh one of the things that i get asked often is concerning the podcast that we want to do and i have made an adjustment to that because i didn't have just one podcast i wanted to do i actually had several that i wanted to do and um two or at least two of them uh maybe even a third one will just be a podcast of my own and then we also wanted to have a podcast of the whole ministry team here and then brother jason already has uh already i don't i'm sure y'all know it by now in the mornings uh that he is on a youtube live streaming and i've been able to drop in a few times when i'm not preparing for my bible study which starts immediately on the heels of that sometimes i'll listen in the background oh well i'm getting ready for that morning bible study i'm in that every day and i've took a a a few days off while i felt bad and the brothers covered for me but we have such a good time in there and such wonderful ministry in there i'm so enjoying it but but i've actually taken a few steps just to fyi um got some other equipment so that i will be able to at least until we can get up to full steam and we're not going to be able to do it just yet we want to do it to say all things are ready a lot of things are ready for it but we're not quite impositioned for it perfectly however i do uh have managed to get some things that i will be putting in position uh very quickly i'm talking within the first week of the new year i should be at least one or two of the individual podcasts that i want to do livestream on youtube and facebook and our church website they'll be posted there and there's some things that i want to do there a couple of ideas that i've got um and so i wanted to kind of give you that uh little heads up on that we are looking to go into the new year strong and i want to encourage you as a church to cast down fear i want to tell you something friends i wanted to speak to those of you who have felt too much fear to be back in regular church services i want to encourage you to ask the lord and pray and i'm going to pray for you specifically and ask the lord to give you the courage to reassemble on a regular basis if you don't okay god bless you i get it i'm i'm determined not to press anyone uh beyond uh their faith but i'm i'm gonna tell you something friends as a shepherd i can see that this staying out of church and just streaming all the time has taken quite a bit from some of you and i that hurts my heart see i i want to see you strong in the lord strong in the power of his might strong in faith i want to see your schedules manipulated i've got i've got people that i'm praying for and uh who's whose work schedules uh keep them from being at church often on wednesdays and sundays and i'm i'm praying been praying for a little while that god will change that and i'm just waiting for him to come to me and say man i'm having all kinds of problem on my job and i'm going to say well there's a reason behind that and i might it might be uh you know um might be causing you some some trouble but but i want to see god's family in the house of god and i pray it constantly lord and i'll name the person that's in my mind and then i'll name the next one i'll name the next one i want to see it lord i want you to do whatever you need to do in their life or their career or whatever to see that they can be in the house of god with their families uh so uh if if things start go sideways on you well just chuck that up to me praying for you amen so i want to see the fear dissolve because listen friends until we get out of here i mean as i said earlier 2021's not going to be better than 2020. right so what are you going to do just hide in fear forever when are you finally going to just throw it down and say i'm not given the spirit of fear i'm given the spirit of a sound mind that's what the promise of adoption is that you are not given the spirit of fear stop fearing fear as brother ernie says f-e-a-r is false evidence appearing real and i'm going to hear i'm here to tell you if god can keep a hold of your soul he can keep a hold of your body he can keep a hold of your family he's all powerful in case you haven't heard recently he's all powerful and i would rather see you uh put a foot forward in faith and trust the lord and i i want to see that i i hope that we don't have to uh of course we're going to continue to operate in prudence we're still going to operate um in wisdom we've managed by the grace of god by the way that the decisions that we've made as a group and i've i've striven to not make them arbitrarily and the brothers and the other officers the deacons and the trustees and the ministry team i'm sure would testify to you tonight if you ask them that that brother jason has consulted the team time and time again time and time again we talk it out uh we've we've met in person we've talked on the phone we meet in chat uh and i'm i'm i'm open for everyone's opinion um and and i and and the brothers know i'm gonna take every all the advice i get because i want it and i'm gonna pray about it all and i'm gonna follow what i feel is the mind of the lord and uh and they they trust me and uh and i know you do and and and i'll tell you something friends you can you know why you can trust me because i trust him and i know he won't mislead us i know that if brother branham taught us that that in important matters that that when you don't know what to do and you've got an important decision to make that you've got to bring your heart down to neutral before god and just come to a point in the presence of god where you can say lord whatever is your will i'm ready to do it i just need to know what it is and that's the kind of man that god will speak to and in fact is brother branham said if he doesn't and there and he doesn't speak and there's not a vision or prophecy or leading that's very strong or lead you into a scripture or something he said then you just do the best way you can feel in your heart and there's been times i've had to do that and brother branham said this he said because i i do not believe that god would let a man that sincere who who don't know what to do but he's trying to do the right thing and he's asking god to help him and he means it and he's he's humble and he's ready to do whatever god wants to do and he don't know exactly he said and he said i don't believe god would let that kind of a man make a mistake and if he is making a mistake then god is obligated to turn him around and put him back on the right path because god can't respect persons and that was what paul ran into uh you know and and paul brother branham said he prayed all night and he waited on god and god never spoke and he got up the next morning he didn't know what to do he said he just went what the best way he could feel in his heart and he saddled his mule and headed off in one direction and he said a vision broke before him and a man from macedonia waving at him saying brother paul come our way brother and said he just turned his meal around and went that way and so i'm going to tell you some of the friends i i i have proven i stand here before you today and i can say and if i said it any other way i'd just be lying i have never seen that fail whenever i've been able to meet god and pray my way to neutrality now you can't brother branham said you can't even ask god for his will if you're not neutral right he said first you've got to pray to get neutral because if you don't you'll have your feelings in on the prayer and you'll imagine god gives you permission when he never even opened his mouth because it's your own desires wanting to do it and you'll trick your own self and i've done that too i've made that mistake and boy i tell you what you know what you when you when you fall enough you master walking i love that brother at one at one point for that little child walking used to be a trial until he mastered it and that's so beautiful i want to tell you something it's like that in life you know until you master running until you master riding a bicycle until you master swimming it's a trial it's stress it's anxiety but once you master it wow then you're you're never free it's like riding a bike you never forget it and i tell you i've learned you know how to trust god and i've learned how to stay before him until i'm neutral i've learned how to just you know kick it out of gear brother ernie how's that he says that he says that that uh patience i think it's i think it's patience he said real faith he says faith is idling your motor when you feel like stripping the gears and so when you feel like just laying it to it and stripping the gears he said you just idle idle the motor and just wait on the lord and i have learned in all directions to wait on the lord and uh there's been many times friends you know even even i've had it sometimes and i can testify to this as well when you can when you trust god when you really trust him and i mean it ain't no joke you really do trust him and he knows it because you can't you can't hide it from him anyway so you might as well be honest how are you going to hide it from god so just come to him in honesty and you you might need to say lord i believe but help thou my unbelief that's not going to offend him he's heard that request before he met that need before and so you know i i've had to come to god that way before but but when i come to him really trusting him there's been times where i and you know even within my own flesh was was ready and a reaction as i was talking about earlier not always action sometimes it's a reaction and ready to react and go put my hands on a situation and just take the bull by the horns you know how you can get sometimes and the lord literally run ahead of me and interdict and block me literally block me from doing it and then within a day or two later it fixed itself and was smooth as silk and i realized i had to blow the whole thing to pieces i'm going to tell you something i want to give you a testimony from a man who's been who's been a christian a long time and i've been preaching the gospel many years and and was you know working in the ministry a decade before i started pulpit preaching i was working in the ministry and i i i can tell you that you can trust the lord he is trustworthy you can put you can rest in christ you can rest in his promise you don't have to be stressed amen you don't have to be you don't have to suffer anxiety just give it to him he already knows what to do he already knows what you need he understa a lot of times he'll start doing for you in the way that you think is the opposite see of what he should be doing that's only because he knows what you need better than you and you you want it to go a certain way because you think you have a certain need he's looking at going actually that's not really your problem so i'm going to go over here and fix your problem it's going to look weird to you but just trust me it'll all come out and it does every single time we want to you know we've had a a a a great desire to to really double down uh on missions and it's been it's been quiet for 2020 as far as as far as traveling but the lord is faithful i you know brother matt and i'm brother jd we've talked uh at length about missions and and brother george who helps me on our local missions here and and then brother brother jason still um runs present truth ministries which is which has not been absorbed by bethel tabernacle that's why i said when brother jason first moved here and i say to all my preacher friends listen if you've been supporting uh pete uh ptm if you've been supporting present truth ministries please keep it going because we're not absorbing it but jason simply relocated his headquarters from minnesota here to south carolina and that ministry is still going strong brother jason is still active he's not boots on the ground because it's been impossible but uh it may be that in 2021 some of that will open back up he's desiring it so pray for that will you will you remember to please pray that the lord will open up travel again so that he can actually go and i have a desire maybe to visit a few of those places brother dale has went many times uh representing the church here as well and um so we want to continue to do that then we're we're also doing that's not the only thing we're involved in with missions and so you know i i have people even people to this day who don't even come to this church who used to come to it who still send in missionary support and still send in offerings and things like that and and we always appreciate that it always goes to that because we're involved in more than just uh what we're involved with in present truth ministries brother george helps me keep that organized and keeps me abreast of what's going on kind of an adasha for me and so we're that's how we came in contact with the needs in in central america that's how we came in contact with the needs uh in the philippines and so we want to continue doing that so uh you know i'm not at all uh shy about saying hey give to missions friends give to missions i know that you know even when we're when we're not here we were it was a little amusing i think brother matthew it was amusing to him and i would sister dave and i were watching sunday and he said are we still taking up an offering because nobody was really here but but uh but he mentioned that we do have the paypal accounts and we do and use them hey the church still has to pay its light bill still has to pay water bills still has to pay um you know the different expenses of the building and the cost to clean it and the ministry still has needs they still go on missions is still a constant need and it will be until the lord comes and so you know the greatest the greatest mission of this church ought to be to either go or send someone amen and so i i really want you to be faithful in your giving we have every available opportunity for you to do it and so we want you to continue to be faithful in that and we certainly appreciate the years of high high percentage of faithfulness of bethel tabernacle and i've i've been in a lot of churches and uh and it wasn't that way and so i've always been very grateful for the heart of bethel tabernacle to their ties and their offerings and missions and building and everything and you've always been over the years every time and actually the the congregation we have now is uh almost not in any way the congregation we had the first 10 years uh i think maybe um i'm sure gonna forget somebody if i start down this road but you know as far as like the old original the old original assembly other than probably brother michael and sister wanda and i know sister debbie's at home thinking of somebody i'm forgetting but um and of course my family but other than that you know the church is almost completely turned over to whole new people but at the same time it's always been a giving church that's never failed never ceased and so i appreciate that friends god bless you god bless you for that and please be praying for the missionary work that we ought to do because the needs are great we can't do them all right we can't do them all we'd love to do them all we can't do them all so we have to be selective and we don't want to choose we'd rather the lord choose amen and so we stay in prayer and we we stay before the lord on what um he would have us do because we can't do it all you know i i i hope that 2021 brings us back you know we've got meetings that we'd like to run revivals that we'd like to have in january by the will of the lord hopefully if all things stay as they are as of this point it's a go i'll be hosting a minister's meeting here in the middle of of uh january and uh we're going to have um brother uh brother jack from down jump by the jack duff now most of y'all either know him or have heard of him he pastors down in west palm wonderful wonderful wonderful brother he joins us in the mornings on the bible study and he takes at least one day a week and so whenever we have the saturday ministers meeting for ministers then on the sunday a lot of times i'll keep one of the preachers over and i've asked brother jack to stay over so that'll be on the 17th i want you to be looking forward to that and i would sure love to sometime in the spring regardless of conditions unless conditions just deteriorate horribly i sure would like to run a big spring meeting maya 2020 do you realize how many annual camp meetings had to be canceled i mean every one of them had to be some of them that had ran for 40 years plus without ceasing and others 20 and 30 years without ceasing had to be canceled i i sure want to see that come back and i'm trusting that the lord will make a way for that we've got other things that we're going to be doing i want to mention this um as you know um brother kevin and sister sarah have been hosting the financial peace university classes and we did it twice now and in fact is uh brother jason demars also has the training to do the one for small business owners because that's kind of a little bit it's a little bit different and he says he's well uh well qualified to teach that so coming in the new year we want to do some more of that and i i'm going to make an announcement and uh i trust the lord will allow me to keep the promise and i won't have to uh rescind it but in in 2020 all of the ones that we held uh we there was a tuition that you had to pay and uh we'd like to announce that when we hold them going forward uh from here on uh i'm going to cover the cost myself of any body married couples teenagers older married couples young married couples mid-grade mid-level married single doesn't matter male or female i i i don't not going to get into it tonight but there is a there is a number of of couples that could stand in this pulpit kevin and sarah not the least of which would be brother kevin and sister sarah to tell you in remarkable re stunning is is the word for it stunning results that they have had in their personal finances by observing biblical based principles that are taught in those seminars they are good they are excellent i want to see the whole church i i think every young man i think if you've got sons coming up they need to be in that class when we have them in 2021 and not just young men young women uh you know because a lot of times a lot of times it sure is the condition in my house you know where the the man either he's working in the field and he's got a maybe a small business and he's he's going you know crazy just trying to keep that going and he has really no time for the to handle the finances of the home and that's what a wife can can pull right in there and help him i appreciate sister debbie for that she's way better at keeping those things organized than i am and so um i'm not a bit too uh embarrassed to admit that that sister debbie uh manages the finances of our home and um you know i i'm because i i have all of the church responsibility and the finance of the church upon me and so sister debbie handles that and we work great together and uh you know i i encourage if the if

financial peace classes has completely revolutionized uh their their finances and hey that's a boon for me if we want a spiritual church then i need spiritual families because a church just collection of families see and if i want to if we if we want to have a fine i know this sounds carnal but if we want a financially sound church i need financially sound families amen can y'all say amen to that too amen thank you uh so these things all work hand in hand friends i've said it so many times it's a it's a mantra it's a it's a philosophy you you you probably heard me say it a thousand times we're

you something as i live and breathe and standing here tonight i feel encouraged in the lord i feel strength and vision and fresh vision and every time a new year comes you know it's time to to reflect on the on the times of stumbling and it's time to to redouble efforts and strengthen yourself where you're weak and shore up the holy spirit in your homes how many know you need to do that it's maintenance christian life you have to maintenance a christian life see this is a poisonous poisonous toxic age that we live in we swim around in the atmospheres of demon power you don't get that all the time because life just looks like life but i'm here to tell you you literally swim around on a daily basis in a demonically toxic atmosphere the lid torn off of hell no other age other than this age has that ever been true about but it is now you're living in the age of impossibility where satan is the god of the age literally he's had six thousand years and he has built his eden to its zenith and that's why you see the craziness that is in the world today and i i'm gonna go to prayer and if there's any prayer requests just send them to me and i'm just looking to make sure here's a prayer request from sister gene to pray for my cherokee friend marlene and her girls and pray about aunt doris and the loss of her husband unexpectedly sister jean you're talking about a missionary

next 10 minutes or so i love this song it's meant quite a bit to me and i i i sing it all the time let me read you uh a quote here from brother branham he's in the message in 1952 jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever and he says now just a moment he says slowly sister abide with me if you will and let's just kind of get near to god remember before you start praying he says look this way the angel of god whose servant i am is standing less than three feet from me right now you think i'd say that if i didn't know what i was talking about he's moving right in you can just feel it coming in it's his presence you know when i read that [Music] and i hope this is true for you when i read a quote like that i have an affinity with that i get that because i felt that presence how many have ever had those times where you're just quietly before the lord in prayer maybe you're singing a little song quietly under your breath and you just feel that sweet aroma that sweet presence of god just move in it's not lightning is not flashing that's not what i'm talking about i've had those times too where you just feel like you could run through a troop and leap over a wall and and those times are wonderful but you know something friends we're coming down to the end of the year tonight was going to be our communion service give us one last time to dedicate ourselves to god to to express to the lord our gratitude for his many blessings and keeping us through the year through a very tumultuous year to to take the time to thank him for that to take the time to ask his pardon for our mistakes to ask his pardon for our weaknesses and our failures we got them don't we friends amen we got them i sure got them but you know i i don't want to keep them [Music] i don't want to keep
