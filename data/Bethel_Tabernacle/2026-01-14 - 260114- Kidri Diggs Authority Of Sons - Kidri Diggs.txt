Now, if you have little dry cereals and things, [music] something that's a little inconsistent, not inconsistent, that's not the word. Inconspicuous is the word. That would be okay. Babies with [music] bottles is that's another thing. But um we have some chairs that are getting [music] some stains on them and stuff from food. So um it's also why we don't want no crayons in the sanctuary [music] because sometimes they get left behind. They get stepped into the carpet. And um we're not going [music] to mention gum. I'm just kidding. Come on. It's okay. Little levity ain't going to hurt you. Praise the Lord. But so we just uh no eating food in the sanctuary. We know that.

Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. [music] Would you turn really quick and just look somebody in the eyes and say, "God bless you." Amen.

Sister Brenda, won't you come and give us a song this evening? Amen. You can be seated. Amen. Sister Brenda, let's give her a hand. Amen. &gt;&gt; [music] [snorts] &gt;&gt; Out [music] on [singing] the water, storms raging [music] high. The waters [singing] around them were troubled that night and fear filled their heart. They thought they [singing] would [music] die, but they failed to remember. The master [music and singing] was nigh and he spoke the [singing] word and the winds all stood [music] still. Even the waters they obeyed [music and singing] his will. He calmed their storm [music and singing] just like he will mine. If I'll [music] just remember that he lives deep inside. [music] So why should I [singing] worry? Why should [music] I fear when [singing] the very same Jesus, he stays [singing] always [music] near. He lives in my heart [singing] and he hears [music] when I cry. I'll call on [singing] his name till the storm [music] passes by. [singing] [music] We read in [singing] the Bible how he [music] walked with them, brought light to their [music and singing] darkness when their way grew so [music] dear. How great it would be to have his [music] steps leading [singing] mine and to walk with the master all of the [music] time. So when trials [singing] come and death [music] seems so nigh, [singing] I'll search for the master. He said he'd be there [music] on time. And when I'm in trouble and my [singing and music] body's in pain, all I have to do is call [music] his name. [singing] Why should I worry? [music] Why should [singing] I fear? [music] Very same Jesus, he stays [singing] always near. He lives in [music] my heart and he hears when I cry. [music] [singing] I'll call on his name till the storm passes [music] by. So [singing] why should I worry? And why should [singing] I [music] fear when the very same Jesus? He stays always [music] near. He lives in my heart and he hears [music and singing] me when I cry. Call on his name till the storm passes by. [music] And I'll call on [singing] his name [music] till the storm passes by. [singing] &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; key F. Please, won't you stand with me? Sing a little bit of heart of worship. Amen. When the music fades and all is stripped away and the simple come, longing just to bring [music] something that's a word that [music] will bless your heart. I'll bring you more than a song. For a song in itself [music] is not what you have required. [music] You search much deeper within through [music] the way things appear. You're looking into my [singing] heart. [music] I'm coming back to the heart of [music] worship when it's all about you. [music] All about you, Jesus. I'm sorry, Lord, [singing and music] for things I made when [music] it's all about [singing] you. All about [music] you, Jesus. [music] King of endless world. No one could express how much you deserve. [music] Though we [music] can hold and all [singing] I have is yours. Every [music] single breath I'll bring you [music] more than a song. For a song [music] in itself is not [singing] what you have required. You [music] search much deeper within through the way things [music and singing] are. You're looking into my heart. [music] I'm coming back to the heart of [singing] worship when it's [music] all about you. All about you, Jesus. I'm sorry, Lord, [music] for being found [singing] when [music] it's all about you. all about you, [music] Jesus. I'm coming [singing] back to the heart of [music] worship. When it's all about you, all about you, Jesus. I'm sorry, Lord, for [music] things I made when it's [music and singing] all about you. All about [music] you, Jesus. [singing] Let's give the Lord another praise offering. [applause] &gt;&gt; How many is ready for the word now? Let's sing. Because he lives, I can face tomorrow. Is Brother Diggs come? Amen. Because he lives, [singing] I can face tomorrow [music] because he lives. [music] All fear is gone [music and singing] because I [music] know [singing] [music] he holds my future. [music] Our life is worth [music] the living just because he lives. Let's get the Lord away for humans. [music] And because he lives, [music] I can be [music] [music] Heat. Heat. Heat. [music] [music] Oh my [music and singing] word. [music] Because he lives across [music] the building. I can face you all. [music] [singing] [music] [music] I [music] know. I [music] [music] love [music] Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord. And life is worth living because he lives. Amen. It's good to be home again. [music] Certainly appreciate all of you coming out. Amen. To be in the house of the Lord. &gt;&gt; God. &gt;&gt; You know, I'm I'm to a place where every time I [music] come to church, I expect to see God. &gt;&gt; If you don't come with that mindset, it's [music] just tradition to you. But when we gather, we gather as children of God. We ought to expect to see our father. &gt;&gt; Our gathering is not [music] in vain. Amen. We certainly appreciate Pastor Jason. Amen. And governments of the church. Let's just have a word of prayer and we'll get right into the word of God. If you [music] have a need, you can acknowledge it by uplifted hand. Let's pray. Lord Jesus, Father, like the song says, because you live, we can face tomorrow, Lord. Lord, and we don't face it in our own human ability, but we face it knowing that you live, Lord. And whatever we stand in need of, Father, you've already done it, Lord. You've already, Lord, brought us out of the pawn shop. You pleaded [music] our case. You became our &gt;&gt; judge, jury, everything, Lord God, that would beset us, Lord. You took care of it. So, Lord, here we are as your people, Lord, the sheep in your pasture. Father, we just pray that you would lay your hands upon us tonight, Lord. Lord, naturally and spiritually, Father, and mold us, Lord, make us fit for the master's use, Lord. &gt;&gt; Lord, if there's anything, Lord, you find anything in us, Lord, that doesn't reflect you, Lord, remove it, Lord, and replace them with something refreshing of thy spirit, Lord. And Lord, as we say so many times, Lord, forgive us for our sins and trespasses, Lord. Lord, in the areas in our lives, Lord, that we may struggle with that no one sees but you. Father, we plead your blood right now. &gt;&gt; Lord, in a multitude of sin, Lord God, we just pray that the Holy Spirit would dominate the service, Lord, that you will become even more real to us than you've already been. wonderful and masterless name of Jesus Christ we pray. The church say amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Those of you have your Bibles, let's turn to um Matthew chapter [music] 16. Matthew 16. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; You know Jesus in this verse of scripture asked them, "Who do men say I am?" &gt;&gt; You know, and they identified with they they identified him with what somebody else was saying &gt;&gt; at the time, you know, a reflection of what other people thought. &gt;&gt; But then in verse 16, no, let's back up to verse 15. &gt;&gt; [clears throat] &gt;&gt; Matthew 16:15, the Bible says, "He saith unto them, but whom say ye that I am?" &gt;&gt; Somebody got to answer that question. But in the midst of that, the Bible says, "And Simon Peter answered and said, Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God." And Jesus answered and said unto him, "Blessed art thou Simon by Jonah." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If I could just put in there, this this is not in the scripture, but Jesus is saying, "Blessed art thou Simon by John by Jonah, for you know who I am." Right. &gt;&gt; He says, "For flesh and blood have not revealed it unto thee, but my father which is in heaven. And I say also unto thee that thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build my church, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it. [clears throat] And I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven." &gt;&gt; Amen. And whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven. And whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven. Then charge he his disciples that they should tell no man that he was Jesus the Christ. Let's go to Acts chapter one. Acts chapter 1 verse 8. familiar verse of scripture. The Bible says Acts 1:8, it says, "But ye shall receive power after the Holy Ghost is upon you, and ye shall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem, and in Judea, in Samaria, and unto the uttermost part of the earth." Amen. May the Lord bless reading of his word. You can have your seats. Amen. Tonight I want to use for a subject authority of sons. &gt;&gt; Authority of sons. I think uh I don't necessarily want to have to pull up the word of what authority means. I think we got a good idea of what authority means. But I think we need to reflect a little bit. Man was created to have authority. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We don't we don't we I think we mistake sometimes. Yes, the Bible does say that he gave up to us power. But in that scripture that that particular word power means exusia and that means authority. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You know and God has given us authority. Amen. NOW YOU THINK ABOUT IT AS MY SUBTITLE IS uh who are you? Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You know, knowing know as sons as sons of God and having authority, I THINK IT'S TIME FOR US TO TO exercise &gt;&gt; and knowing who we are. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, I want to I WANT TO JUST GIVE YOU A LITTLE INSIGHT, you know, and and where this thought came from. You know, I was at the gym when I was working out and I was listening to some music and THAT SONG CAME ON. I KNOW WHO I AM. HALLELUJAH. AMEN. &gt;&gt; And you know, and it and it just would not leave MY SPIRIT. HALLELUJAH. THAT SONG SAYS, "I'M WALKING IN POWER." &gt;&gt; I I I I work in miracles. I know who I am. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But to do to exercise in that level of faith, you have to know who you are. Amen. And I THINK ONE THING THAT GOD HAS done through the preaching of the word of the hour, he's come to restore unto us, hallelujah, THE TRUE IDENTITY of who sons and daughters are. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But what I WANT US TO REFLECT ON TONIGHT is do we operate, HALLELUJAH, FROM THE HOUSEHOLD OF GOD WHICH WE CAME FROM? &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. Think about it. as a son or as a daughter in a particular house. When you're hungry, YOU CAN JUST GO TO the refrigerator and eat. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; Talk to me, somebody. &gt;&gt; You don't have to go pray about it. &gt;&gt; If it if it's nothing that's going TO MAKE YOU SICK, YOU DON'T EVEN NEED PERMISSION FROM MAMA AND DADDY. YOU HAVE AUTHORITY TO EAT. &gt;&gt; YOU HAVE PRIVILEGES. HALLELUJAH. YOU CAN JUST GO IN THERE, and I'm gonna say this, which we probably won't do it. YOU CAN GO THERE, EAT AS MUCH SPINACH AS YOU WANT TO. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; BECAUSE YOU GOT A RIGHT &gt;&gt; IN THAT HOUSEHOLD TO BE FED AS A SON OR A DAUGHTER. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; You got privileges. Amen. And you know, church, as I thought about this and Amen, you know, the the &gt;&gt; Holy Spirit is heavy. It's heavy in here tonight. &gt;&gt; It's been heavy ever since I've been coming down the road. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And I and I'm sure you've uh it may have been an alert to what brother Matt sent out about come to church. Hallelujah. What that was about was COME TO CHURCH WITH EXPECTATION. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. WE'RE NOT WAITING ON A PARTICULAR THING TO HAPPEN. YOU CAN MAKE it happen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. THAT'S WHO WE ARE AS SONS. AS SONS and daughters. Hallelujah. WHEN YOU GET OF A CERTAIN AGE, YOU GOT A KEY TO THE HOUSE. &gt;&gt; HAL, YOU GOT AUTHORITY. YOU GOT PRIVILEGES TO COME AND GO AS YOU PLEASE. HALLELUJAH. AND IT'S THE SAME THING IN THE HOUSEHOLD OF GOD. WE HAVE AUTHORITY. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; THE BIBLE SAYS, I GIVE UNTO YOU POWER. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; POWER MEANING AUTHORITY. BUT I WANT TO READ YOU SOMETHING. AMEN. In a nutshell where we're going tonight, the prophet of God, he says in um this is in wisdom versus faith. Hallelujah. He says, "THEN IF JESUS DEFEATED SATAN," HALLELUJAH. HOW many would just love to know that the enemy was defeated? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Half of us, half of us, &gt;&gt; ALL OF US ARE GOING THROUGH SOMETHING. And wouldn't it do you some real real good TO KNOW THAT YOUR ENEMY WAS DEFEATED? &gt;&gt; NO MATTER HOW MUCH HE RAISED HIS HEAD, NO MATTER HOW MUCH HE TALKED, NO MATTER WHAT HE'S DONE IN THE PAST, TO KNOW THIS VERY MOMENT, HALLELUJAH, IN BETHL TABERNACLE, YOUR ENEMY, THE DEVIL, IS DEFEATED. &gt;&gt; WOULDN'T YOU WANT TO STAND ON THAT ASSURANCE TONIGHT? &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. WOULD YOU WANT TO LOOK AT WHATEVER'S BEEN ILLING YOU? WHATEVER SICKNESS, WHATEVER PROBLEMS IN THE HOUSE, WOULDN'T YOU WANT TO LOOK AT IT STRAIGHT IN THE FACE AND KNOW THAT IT WAS DEFEATED? &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; He says, "Then if Jesus defeated SATAN UPON THE FAITH, HALLELUJAH, KNOWING WHO HE WAS," HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; Oh my. Jesus defeated the enemy simply BY KNOWING WHO HE WAS. &gt;&gt; HE DIDN'T HAVE TO UH UH DO SOMETHING SPECIAL. HE DIDN'T HAVE TO HAVE FIRE COME OUT HIS HAND. ALL HE HAD TO DO WAS BY THE REVELATION OF GOD KNOW WHO HE IS. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AND THERE WERE MANY OF TIMES, HALLELUJAH, WHERE JESUS WOULD COME AND HE SAID, HALLELUJAH, WHEN YOU SEE ME, YOU SEE THE FATHER. &gt;&gt; HE WAS CERTAIN &gt;&gt; WHO HE WAS. knowing who he was. He was predestinated. He was a predestinated creature. Are you ready? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The prophet says, the congregation says, "Amen." Thank you, brother Luther. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; Are you ready? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are you ready? &gt;&gt; I'm going to SAY IT AGAIN. WE ARE NOT IN AN INSURANCE SEMINAR. THIS IS A NEW YEAR AND WE OUGHT TO BE EXPECTING MANIFESTATION. &gt;&gt; HONEY, WHEN WE COME TO CHURCH, WE GOT A PROMISE WHERE THE BIBLE SAYS WHEREVER TWO OR THREE ARE GATHERED, THERE WILL ALSO BE IN THE MIDST. NOW, DO YOU BELIEVE GOD IS HERE? &gt;&gt; AND IF YOU BELIEVE IT, I'LL ASK THE QUESTION, ARE YOU READY FOR HIM TO MOVE? &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. RIGHT NOW &gt;&gt; IN THIS VERY MOMENT. &gt;&gt; WHATEVER'S HALLELUJAH AFFECTING YOUR LUNGS, WE TAKE AUTHORITY OVER IT RIGHT NOW IN THE NAME OF JESUS. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; I'M A [screaming] SON. &gt;&gt; ARE YOU A SON? &gt;&gt; SO YOU CAN TAKE AUTHORITY over it &gt;&gt; in the name of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It's too often we learn to live with what's bothering us. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; JOSHUA DIDN'T DO THAT. AND JOSHUA WAS A TYPE OF THE HOLY SPIRIT. HALLELUJAH. WHEN JOSHUA LOST THE [screaming] BATTLE, JOSHUA CALLED A SOLEMN ASSEMBLY AND SAID, "SOMETHING'S WRONG." &gt;&gt; CUZ AS A SON, I GOT AUTHORITY AND I'M NOT SUPPOSED TO LOSE ANY BATTLE. &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; We're not supposed to lose. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When you know who you are. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And what I love about Joshua, oh my church, I ain't going to be long. You know why I ain't going to be long? &gt;&gt; Cuz I will get a Holy Spirit time to do what he said he would do. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Church, what I love about Joshua, Joshua went to battle and lost against Ai. Some of you are losing the battle right now against Ai. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Joshua lost the battle against Ai, but then he WENT BACK AND CHECKED the whole assembly and said, "Hey, I don't know about y'all, but I ain't USED TO LOSING. GOD GAVE ME A PROMISE. GOD GAVE ME A WORD." AND THAT WORD HAS TO BECOME A PERSONAL REVELATION. &gt;&gt; JOSHUA COULDN'T GO BY WHO WAS SCARED AND WHO WAS AFRAID. ALL HE COULD DO, CHRIS, WAS GO BY WHAT GOD TOLD HIM. AND GOD TOLD HIM, "BE STRONG AND VERY COURAGEOUS." AMEN. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HE SAID, "I'VE CALLED YOU TO TAKE THE PEOPLE INTO THE PROMISED LAND." SO WHEN JOSHUA LOST THE BATTLE, HALLELUJAH. WHEN THE REVELATION KICKED IN, THE VERY BATTLE HE LOST, HE WENT BACK TO IT. &gt;&gt; LOOKED THE ENEMY STRAIGHT IN THE FACE AND HE TOOK AUTHORITY &gt;&gt; over the enemy as a son. &gt;&gt; Who are you? &gt;&gt; Are you any different from Joshua? &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you, brother. Oh my. He said he was predestinated creature. Are you Are you ready? &gt;&gt; Thank you, brother Luther. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You see how we do when it come to spiritual things. We go in and out, &gt;&gt; in and out, in and out. LET'S ENGAGE. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. LET'S ENGAGE. LET'S TAP IN. LET'S LET THE ENEMY KNOW I AIN'T SITTING DOWN ANYMORE. &gt;&gt; I'M LOOKING AT YOU FACE TO FACE CUZ I KNOW WHO I AM. &gt;&gt; I'M NOT AFRAID OF YOU. HALLELUJAH. I AM A SON. &gt;&gt; I HAVE AUTHORITY. HIS SPIRIT LIVES IN ME. THE SAME LIFE THAT DEFEATED YOU IN HEAVEN, KICKED YOU DOWN TO EARTH AND DEFEATED YOU AGAIN IS NOW LIVING IN ME. SO I'M NOT [screaming] AFRAID OF YOU. &gt;&gt; I got authority. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; As a son, he says, "Are you ready?" &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you, sister. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. What about the predestinated bride of Jesus Christ? Now, &gt;&gt; you believe the bride is predestinated. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The predestinated bride of Christ. Now the church, the word seed with everything that God promised to put in the church, it hallelujah. EVERYTHING THAT GOD PROMISED to put in the church in it right now. &gt;&gt; WHATEVER YOU NEED, HALLELUJAH, TO OVERCOME TONIGHT IS IN YOU RIGHT NOW. &gt;&gt; YOU DON'T HAVE TO WAIT TO A SPECIAL MEETING. YOU DON'T HAVE TO WAIT TO THE CAMP IN OCTOBER. YOU CAN OVERCOME IT RIGHT NOW. &gt;&gt; CUZ THE AUTHORITY IS IN YOU RIGHT NOW. [screaming] &gt;&gt; THE POWER TO BELIEVE IS IN THIS CHURCH RIGHT NOW. &gt;&gt; AND WE TAKE AUTHORITY OVER ANY EVIL SPIRIT right now. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; Right now. Hallelujah. If I can, I'm going just get this out the way. Hallelujah. I know. Hallelujah. Who I am. Yes. &gt;&gt; And I know I'mma I'm I'm going to say this boldly and step out there cuz some of y'all just think it's good preaching. I've been commissioned &gt;&gt; to fight demons. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I've been commissioned &gt;&gt; to preach deliverance ministry. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. [screaming] &gt;&gt; SO IF YOU NEED DELIVERANCE TONIGHT, HALLELUJAH, THE AUTHORITY IS HERE. &gt;&gt; I'M HERE TO HELP YOU. THIS GIFT HAS COME, HALLELUJAH, BY THE POWER OF GOD. [screaming] HALLELUJAH. TO PUT THE ENEMY UNDER OUR FEET TONIGHT. &gt;&gt; But the thing of it is is we come to church and don't expect God to move. &gt;&gt; Like I said, we're sons &gt;&gt; and daughters. When you go in the refrigerator, you expect to eat. &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh my. He said the promises he put in the church in it right now. It's in it now. Everything is in order. Oh, BROTHER JESUS, I'M FIGHTING THIS BATTLE AND MY CHILDREN THIS AND MY JOB this and oh, I'M JUST FIGHTING THIS BATTLE. EVERYTHING IS IN ORDER RIGHT NOW. &gt;&gt; GOD IS TRYING TO RAISE YOU UP. [screaming] HALLELUJAH. BROTHER KING, WILL YOU LOOK AT IT FACE TO FACE AND SAY, "SATAN, I KNOW WHO I AM. I AM A CHILD OF GOD. NOT JUST A CHILD OF GOD, A REDEEMED CHILD OF GOD. &gt;&gt; THAT MEANS I'M WALKING IN POWER. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; Oh my. &gt;&gt; Everything is in order. The Holy Spirit has been given. The seed has been sown. The evening light has been shining. Somebody say, "Amen." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We've had the evening light, THE MESSAGE OF THE HOUR, 50 PLUS YEARS. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; AND YOU LOOK AT ONE OF THE ONE OF THE FIRST FRUIT THAT CAME OUT OF THE VINEYARD. HALLELUJAH. HE WASN'T AFRAID OF DEMONS. &gt;&gt; WHY? CUZ HE KNEW WHO HE WAS. &gt;&gt; EVEN IN THIS RESTING TIME WHEN HE WAS VISITED BY THE DEVIL, HE WOULD LOOK OVER AND SAY, "OH, THAT'S JUST YOU, SATAN. YOU CAN'T EVEN GET IN MY DREAMS UNLESS I ALLOW IT. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; When are we going to stop making Satan more powerful than what he is? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He's only as powerful as we surrender him TO BE. &gt;&gt; YOU MAKE HIM WHAT HE IS. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. CUZ GOD HAS ALREADY DEFEATED HIM. &gt;&gt; YOU MAKE CANCER POWERFUL. YOU MAKE HIGH BLOOD [screaming] POWER, HYPERTENSION, WHATEVER IT IS. YOU MAKE ANXIETY POWERFUL. GOD ALREADY DEALT WITH ALL OF THAT WITH HIS AUTHORITY ON CALVARY'S CROSS. HE CRUCIFIED IT. &gt;&gt; DEALT WITH IT. &gt;&gt; DONE [screaming] AND OVER. &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. &gt;&gt; The only way it comes back is if you let it back. &gt;&gt; Oh my. &gt;&gt; Listen. So what is it, Brother Jigs? How do I get there? Hallelujah. If God has unleashed this authority, how do I get there with all these mistakes I got? &gt;&gt; How do I get there with all these battles and all these fears in my life? How do I get there? I'm not a preacher. I'm not A DEACON. HOW DO I GET THERE? &gt;&gt; LISTEN, this is an exposition of the church age. He said as I have already said this book Revelations is the the consummation of scripture. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; It is EVEN PLACED EXACTLY RIGHT in the canon of scripture at the end. Now you can know why it says that anyone who reads or even hears it is blessed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. WOO. &gt;&gt; HOW MANY CHURCHES THAT ARE OUT THERE, HOW MANY DENOMINATIONS THAT ARE OUT THERE DON'T UNDERSTAND THE BOOK OF REVELATION, BUT GOD CAME TO US, PREACHED ON IT, OPENED IT UP, SHOWED US WHERE WE ARE, [screaming] TOLD US TO COME OUT. HE PLACED US BACK IN CHAPTER 15. WOO! &gt;&gt; SHOWED US EXACTLY WHO WE ARE. &gt;&gt; WE DON'T HAVE TO BE AFRAID OF THE WHITE HORSE RIDER. WE HAVE AUTHORITY OVER HIM. WE DON'T HAVE TO BE AFRAID OF THE SECOND OR THE THIRD OR THE FOURTH. WE DON'T HAVE TO BE AFRAID OF THE PALE HORSE. WE HAVE AUTHORITY. WE DON'T HAVE TO BE AFRAID OF THE MARK OF THE BEAST. &gt;&gt; CUZ WE HAVE AUTHORITY &gt;&gt; AS SONS AND DAUGHTERS. &gt;&gt; Do you know who you are? &gt;&gt; WHO ARE YOU [screaming] TONIGHT? &gt;&gt; Who are you tonight? tonight. You can't use the term I'm a message believer. &gt;&gt; That's just good talk. &gt;&gt; It has to be a revelation. &gt;&gt; Listen. &gt;&gt; He says, "Now you can know why it says that anyone who reads or even hears it is blessed. It is the REVELATION OF GOD THAT WILL GIVE YOU AUTHORITY OVER THE DEVIL. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; YOU SEE HOW SIMPLE THAT IS? &gt;&gt; IT'S THE REVELATION OF JESUS CHRIST. THE SAME THING HE TOLD PETER. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. &gt;&gt; IT'S THE REVELATION OF JESUS CHRIST THAT GIVES US AUTHORITY OVER THE DEVIL TONIGHT. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; COME ON. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; HE SAYS, "FLESH AND BLOOD [screaming] HAVE NOT REVEALED IT UNTO YOU. IT WAS A REVELATION. &gt;&gt; And when YOU KNOW WHO GOD IS, IT SHOULD BE ENOUGH TO DEFEAT THE DEVIL ANYTIME, ANY PLACE, ANYWHERE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; Oh my. Listen, I love this right here &gt;&gt; because God gave the prophet such an understanding when it came to the scripture. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Things we would have never caught a hold of. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Without hearing the voice. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He says WE DON'T HAVE POWER. WE'RE not have power. We got authority. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; IT'S NOT A POWER. IT'S AUTHORITY. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; MY WE DON'T NEED POWER. &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. &gt;&gt; Somebody say, "AMEN." &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. WE DON'T NEED POWER. [screaming] WHY? CUZ WE GOT AUTHORITY. JESUS ALREADY DEMONSTRATED ALL THE POWER THAT THE BELIEVER WOULD EVER NEED. &gt;&gt; AND IF YOU TRUST IN HIM, YOU DON'T NEED POWER. YOU JUST NEED A FAITH. HALLELUJAH. IN THE AUTHORITY OF KNOWING WHO HE IS, &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHY THE BIBLE CAME, BROTHER AARON, AND IT SAID, HALLELUJAH. NOT BY POWER NOR BY MIGHT, &gt;&gt; BUT BY MY SPIRIT, SAY THE LORD. YES. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; But you know what the enemy does? The enemy bluffs some of us. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; We got law enforcement in here. Hallelujah. And you know, they had to go through some special training. &gt;&gt; They had to take time away from their family. Hallelujah. They had to learn the laws of the land &gt;&gt; so they could operate by those laws. And once they completed all the schooling and everything, what happened? They got a badge. [screaming] &gt;&gt; THEY GOT A BADGE. WHEREVER THEY GO IN THEIR COUNTY OR IN THEIR STATE, HALLELUJAH, THEY DON'T HAVE TO SAY A WORD. ALL THEY HAVE TO DO IS FLASH THE BADGE. &gt;&gt; THE BADGE SHOWS, HALLELUJAH, THAT THERE'S AN ORGANIZATION BIGGER THAN JUST ONE PERSON STANDING BEHIND THIS PERSON, &gt;&gt; CHURCH. AND ONCE YOU GET THE BADGE OF THE HOLY GHOST, THERE'S SOMETHING BIGGER THAN YOU IN THE ROOM. &gt;&gt; There's something BIGGER THAN YOU IN YOUR FIRE. THERE'S SOMETHING BIGGER THAN YOU IN YOUR TRIAL OR YOUR STORM. &gt;&gt; THE PROPHET OF GOD SAID, "ALL OF [screaming] HEAVEN IS BACK IN YOU." &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; SIR, &gt;&gt; what if you was in the police car and had no authorization? That mean I didn't have to pull over. I can even talk junk TO YOU. GET OUT THAT CAR, YOU FAKE COP. But me, I'm a little bit more aggressive. I'll be like, "YOU AIN'T NOTHING BUT OLD PIG. [snorts] Get on out of here." And I might spin off. [screaming] Why? cuz he has no authority to do anything. &gt;&gt; He's bluffing. &gt;&gt; And what the enemy does, hallelujah, HE STUDIES YOU. HE WATCHES YOU. And he knows the areas you're afraid of. &gt;&gt; AND GOD, HE'LL ASK GOD, "Can I get in that area?" Hallelujah. Just to see if you'll stop serving him. So God will say, "Okay, go ahead." THE ONLY REASON WHY GOD LETS HIM GO SO GOD CAN SHOW YOU WHO YOU ARE. AMEN. &gt;&gt; BY THE TIME GOD WAS DONE WITH JOB, JOB WAS SAYING, "HALLELUJAH. I KNOW MY REDEEMER LIVING." &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. AND I'M GOING TO SEE HIM AGAIN IN HIS FLESH. &gt;&gt; THAT TRIAL BOUGHT HIM INTO A CLOSER RECOGNITION OF THE AUTHORITY HE HAD. &gt;&gt; YOUR TRIALS ARE NOT THAT YOU MAY FALL BACKWARDS OR BE DEFEATED. YOUR TRIALS ARE THERE TO GIVE YOU A VICTORY. &gt;&gt; That's good. &gt;&gt; Amen. so you can RISE UP IN AUTHORITY. GOD TOLD ABRAHAM, "GO KILL YOUR SON." AFTER ALL HE DID, ALL GOD WAS TRYING TO DO WAS SHOW HIM, "I GAVE IT ALL TO YOU NOW." &gt;&gt; Then Abraham in THE MIDST OF THAT TRIAL, HALLELUJAH, I'VE BEEN LISTENING TO WHY CRY SPEAK. ABRAHAM IN THE MIDST OF THAT TRIAL, HE WOKE UP THAT MORNING UNDER THE COMMISSION OF WHAT GOD SAID, BUT SOME KIND OF WAY HE REALIZED WHO HE WAS. AMEN. &gt;&gt; AND BEFORE HE LEFT, BEFORE HE TOLD SARAH ANYTHING, HE SAID, "HEY, I AND the lad going to go and worship." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; WE GOING TO GO AND WORSHIP AND WE GOING TO RETURN. WHAT IS THAT? THAT SOUNDS [screaming] LIKE A MAN OF AUTHORITY. &gt;&gt; God didn't say nothing about you coming to return. When you know who you are, &gt;&gt; you speak as God would speak. &gt;&gt; Isn't that what Abraham did? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Where did it COME FROM? ISN'T THAT what what Adam did? Hallelujah. Adam in the Garden OF EDEN, HE SPOKE AS GOD WOULD speak &gt;&gt; with the same authority. He knew who he was. And you want to know who ELSE KNEW WHO HE WAS? THE SERPENT. &gt;&gt; THE SERPENT KNEW WHO HE WAS. AMEN. &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHY THE SERPENT DIDN'T HAVE CONVERSATION WITH ADAM BECAUSE HE KNEW WHO Adam was. &gt;&gt; I WANT TO KNOW TONIGHT WHAT'S BEHIND THAT FLESH THAT'S SITTING IN THESE &gt;&gt; PEWS. &gt;&gt; IS IT THAT SAME SPIRIT THAT WAS HALLELUJAH JESUS CHRIST? &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [snorts] &gt;&gt; Oh my. Listen. He said Christ has the power but we've got the authority. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; THERE'S A LOT OF DIFFERENCE. He was the one who conquered. HE CONQUERED AND GAVE US the authority. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; So, you see who WE SHOULD BE PUTTING OUR FAITH IN. &gt;&gt; YOU SHOULD PUT YOUR FAITH IN CHRIST CUZ HE HAS THE POWER, BUT HE GAVE YOU THE AUTHORITY TO BELIEVE IN HIM. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Somebody say, "I believe." &gt;&gt; I believe. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Listen. &gt;&gt; He conquered and gave us the authority. He's got the power. But we got the authority. &gt;&gt; JUST LIKE AN AMBASSADOR GOING TO ANOTHER COUNTRY. &gt;&gt; WELL, that ambassador. Hallelujah. If I was an ambassador, I ain't going to say America. AS AN AMBASSADOR OF HEAVEN. If I was able to go down into hell, I'D HAVE ALL HEAVEN REPRESENTING ME. &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHAT CHRIST DID. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; WHEN HE WENT DOWN INTO HELL, HE HAD ALL HEAVEN BACKING HIM. HALLELUJAH, CHURCH. THE SAME POWER AND AUTHORITY HE HAD ON EARTH, HE HAD IT DOWN IN THE REGIONS OF HELL. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; CAME DOWN TO SATAN'S HOUSE. &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. TOOK HIS HOUSE KEYS, &gt;&gt; TOLD HIM TO SHUT UP AND GET BACK IN THE OTHER ROOM. &gt;&gt; That's a man with authority. &gt;&gt; Well, no demon would even challenge him. &gt;&gt; No spirit, NO IMP. WHY? THEY knew who he was. &gt;&gt; He was in their element AND THEN IT BECAME HIS ELEMENT. &gt;&gt; IT SAY HALLELUJAH. ALL POWER IN HEAVEN, HELL, AND THE GRAVE &gt;&gt; WAS GIVEN UNTO HIM. &gt;&gt; SO I'M SAYING TO YOU TONIGHT, WHEN YOU GET THE REVELATION, HALLELUJAH, YOU GOT AUTHORITY OVER THE GRAVE. &gt;&gt; When you GET THE REVELATION, YOU GOT AUTHORITY OVER YOUR HELL. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Right now, some of our battles, we feel like we in hell. But I'm here to tell you, you got authority over it. &gt;&gt; As an ambassador of Jesus Christ, &gt;&gt; oh my. Listen. He says, "And when a man or a woman is dressed in the full armor of God, it ain't power, it's authority from the high." When he says, "Devils will stream and break." Hallelujah. HE'S COMPARING THAT TO THE POLICE OFFICER STANDING OUT THERE IN THE MIDDLE OF TRAFFIC. &gt;&gt; Police officer BECAUSE OF HIS HIS HIS AUTHORITY. HALLELUJAH. TRAFFIC CAN BE REAL THICK. EVERYBODY MOVING FAST. IT COULD BE SOME DUMP TRUCKS AND TRACTOR TRAILERS, BUT HE CAN STAND OUT THERE IN FRONT OF IT ALL, HOLD UP THAT ONE HAND, AND EVERYBODY WILL COME TO A HALT. &gt;&gt; AMEN. AND THEN THE PROPHET COMES AND SAYS, "SO IS IT WITH THE SON [screaming] AND DAUGHTER OF GOD &gt;&gt; WHEN YOU KNOW who you are &gt;&gt; AND WHO YOU REPRESENT AND WHAT'S BACKING YOU." HE SAID, "THE DEVIL WILL SCREAM." HALLELUJAH. AND SQUEAK his brakes. &gt;&gt; Oh my. You don't believe that? &gt;&gt; I give you a prime example. Remember there's a man in the Bible named Legion. &gt;&gt; He was in the tombs cutting himself, tormenting people as they walked by the grave site. But one day Jesus say, "I'm going to the grave site." &gt;&gt; Jesus come by the grave site and all legion of far off. All he saw was a body of flesh. &gt;&gt; Something that he was used to tormenting. &gt;&gt; CHURCH AND HE RAN OUT THERE. &gt;&gt; And as he got closer, he could feel something. &gt;&gt; [laughter] &gt;&gt; HE CAN FEEL, HALLELUJAH, THOSE 12 LEGIONS OF DEMONS, THEY COULD FEEL THE MASTER'S PRESENCE AND THEY START TO COME UNDER OBEDIENCE. &gt;&gt; AND THE BIBLE SAYS THEY RAN OUT THERE TO JESUS AND THEY WORSHIP. [screaming] &gt;&gt; WELL, YOU KNOW WHO YOU ARE. SATAN WILL BOW DOWN BEFORE YOU. You say, "Bro Digs, you boy, you boy, you you you you pretty bold." &gt;&gt; CHURCH, &gt;&gt; "I AIN'T GOT THE POWER." HE DOES. &gt;&gt; I got authority [laughter] &gt;&gt; to believe that he can do it. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You know, this this year, I have a theme for myself every year. A theme for myself. And my theme this year is I won't go back. Amen. &gt;&gt; I won't go back. Hallelujah. I'm at the point of no return. &gt;&gt; No matter how sticky it gets, no matter how strenuous the battle is, I'VE SEEN TOO MUCH GOD TO TURN AROUND. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; I'VE HAD TOO MANY VICTORIES TO GIVE UP. &gt;&gt; Oh my. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Last time I was here, Brother Tony was singing a song. Uh, you made a way. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; When my back was against the wall &gt;&gt; and it looked like it was over, you &gt;&gt; made a way. &gt;&gt; You know where that song came from? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. THAT MAN GOT VICTORIES. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. At the age of three, he fell off the balcony. Hallelujah. I think it WAS THREE STORIES DOWN. HALLELUJAH. WALKED AWAY FROM IT. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. SAY BY THE TIME HIS MAMA GOT TO HIM, HE WAS LIFELESS. AND SHE SAID, "OH JESUS." &gt;&gt; They said, "He didn't move." SHE SAID, "OH JESUS, HE DIDN'T MOVE." BUT THE THIRD TIME SHE CALLED JESUS, HE ROSE. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. [laughter] WELL, WHAT WAS SHE DOING? SHE WAS EXERCISING HER [screaming] AUTHORITY OVER DEATH. AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; And she ain't even got the full revelation like you got. &gt;&gt; SAME OLD US FOR NOT BELIEVING GOD. &gt;&gt; But that was just a piece of it. His wife got their first child. I think his name is Jace. Hallelujah. She she was pregnant and 21 weeks her water broke. Her water broke. And when they went to the doctor, ALL THE DOCTOR KNOW IS SCIENCE. &gt;&gt; But I'm going to give you the quote again. Wisdom versus faith. &gt;&gt; WISDOM VERSUS FAITH. &gt;&gt; I DON'T WANT YOUR WISDOM TONIGHT. &gt;&gt; GIVE ME YOUR FAITH. &gt;&gt; GIVE ME YOUR FAITH. &gt;&gt; AND TOGETHER WE'LL TAKE AUTHORITY OVER YOUR PROBLEMS. CHURCH. WISDOM VERSUS FAITH. HE SAID, "THEN JESUS DEFEATED THE DEVIL BY KNOWING WHO HE WAS." &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Church doctor said, "Well, 21 weeks, uh, y'all can try again. The baby ain't going to make it." 21 weeks, baby, you know, it's just too small. ain't going to make it. He said him and his wife looked at each other after the doctor left out the room and they looked at each other and they said, "We trust God too much to give up now." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We trust God &gt;&gt; TOO MUCH TO GIVE UP NOW. &gt;&gt; I WISH I COULD GET AN AMEN IN HERE. WE TRUST GOD TOO MUCH TO GIVE UP. NOW, &gt;&gt; THIS AIN'T A [screaming] TIME TO GIVE UP. THIS IS A TIME TO LOOK AT YOUR PROBLEM AND SAY, "I TAKE AUTHORITY OVER YOU IN THE NAME OF JESUS CHRIST. AS A SON, AS A DAUGHTER OF [screaming] GOD, I KNOW WHO I AM." &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. It's amazing to me, brother Jason. &gt;&gt; When you go through trials, &gt;&gt; holy, especially when it's worldwide, when everybody know about your trial, &gt;&gt; they look at you and they expect for you to be down. &gt;&gt; And then when they see you, take a look at me.

Cuz if you let him ride, he'll want to drive your car. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And if you let him drive, he'll take you too far. &gt;&gt; Don't do it. Don't do it. Don't do it. &gt;&gt; Don't do it. Don't do it. &gt;&gt; Some of y'all see them hitchhiking and y'all slowing down. I'm strong enough. &gt;&gt; See, I'm beyond that. &gt;&gt; If I see him hitchhiking, &gt;&gt; I hit him. [laughter] I ain't worried about the D. I get that fixed. &gt;&gt; I get that feeling. If I got to get a new car, I GET A NEW CAR. HALLELUJAH. But I don't want to see HIM ON MY ROUTE. &gt;&gt; I DON'T WANT TO SEE HIM ON MY ROUTE ASKING FOR FAVORS. I DON'T WANT TO SEE HIM ON MY RAP TALKING ABOUT CAN I GO WHERE YOU GOING? NO YOU [screaming] CANNOT. &gt;&gt; SOME OF Y'ALL NEED TO TELL THE DEVIL NO YOU CANNOT. YOU CANNOT FOLLOW ME. YOU CANNOT HITCHHIKE.

Listen, I ain't going to be too much longer. I'm about to close. Let's go. Let's go to Matthew chapter 10. I hope like the prophet said, remember there's a story of a little girl who was paralyzed &gt;&gt; and she came in a prayer line with a shoe box. I HOPE YOU BROUGHT YOUR SHOE BOX TONIGHT. &gt;&gt; I HOPE THAT TEXT MADE YOU BRING SOME EXPECTATION TO CHURCH. &gt;&gt; That little GIRL KNEW THAT THE PROPHET HAD A MINISTRY. HALLELUJAH. TO GET IN CONTACT WITH GOD AND SHE CAME TO CHURCH WITH A SHOE BOX. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. AND THE PROPHET SAID, "HONEY, WHAT'S THAT UNDER YOUR ARM?" SHE SAID, "A PAIR OF SHOES CUZ AFTER YOU PRAY FOR ME, I'MMA PUT THEM ON AND WALK. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; WHAT IS THAT? THAT'S EXERCISING [screaming] HER AUTHORITY &gt;&gt; BEFORE she even got prayed for. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh my. The prophet said, "Okay, honey, I want you to go sit over here &gt;&gt; and let your faith build up." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. See, some of you are fighting some things you've been fighting for years. Come on. &gt;&gt; But you've been coming here and the ministry's been preaching. &gt;&gt; Whether it be the pastor or brother Caleb or brother Matt or or brother Matt. Hallelujah. Any one of those brothers preaching, I hope I left nobody out, but any of those brothers preaching, what is it? It was to build up your faith &gt;&gt; to get you to that place WHERE YOU COULD ADDRESS IT, BELIEVE, [screaming] AND WALK AWAY WITH THE VICTORY. AMEN. &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHAT THE MESSAGE HAS BEEN DOING. THE MESSAGE HAS BEEN BUILDING YOUR FAITH &gt;&gt; FOR WHAT? A BODY CHANGE. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. church.

And I love how the prophet said, he said, "Think about it. They going back to THEIR VOMIT. IF IT'S VOMIT, IT'S SOMETHING THEY THREW UP. &gt;&gt; That means it was SOMETHING THAT ALREADY MADE THEM SICK. And they go back to it. That mean they GOING TO GET SICK ALL OVER. &gt;&gt; I will not go back. &gt;&gt; What I say in Matthew Matthew 10. &gt;&gt; Oh my verse one. Are you with me? Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And when he had called unto his 12 disciples, he gave them power &gt;&gt; against unclean spirits to cast them out and to heal all manner of sickness &gt;&gt; and all manner of disease. Now, my question to you is, does that have an expiration date? &gt;&gt; [crying] &gt;&gt; So that mean what he gave to the disciples back then. I don't know ABOUT YOU, BUT I'M A DISCIPLE. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. [screaming] &gt;&gt; SO THAT MEANS THE SAME POWER PETER, JAMES, AND JOHN HAVE, BROTHER DIGGS GOT TONIGHT. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.

HE SAID, "MASTER, WILL YOU ALLOW US TO GO INTO THE PIGS?" HE SAID, "GO AHEAD." OH MY. IF GOD WILL GRANT THE DEVIL'S WISH, &gt;&gt; WHAT ABOUT YOU? THE DEVIL KNEW WHO HE WAS. [screaming] HE KNEW THAT GOD COULD GRANT HIS WISH. WHAT ABOUT YOU? IF HE GRANT THE WISH OF DEMONS, &gt;&gt; WHAT [screaming] ABOUT US AS SONS AND DAUGHTERS OF GOD? &gt;&gt; YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO ASK THAT YOUR JOYS MAY BE FULL. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; He says he had called to him 12 disciples. He gave them power against unclean spirits &gt;&gt; to cast out. Hallelujah. AND TO HEAL ALL MANNER &gt;&gt; of sickness. &gt;&gt; All manner &gt;&gt; if it's in this church tonight. Let me tell you, let me say it like this. If it's in this church, if a sickness is in this church tonight, I got authority over it. And if you'll give me consent, I'll deal with that demon. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; But I don't want your faith to rely on me. &gt;&gt; The same faith THAT GOD GAVE ME, HE GAVE UNTO YOU. HE GAVE IT TO THE 12. AND HE SAID, "ONE OF YOU IS THE DEVIL." &gt;&gt; You don't have to wait for a preacher to lay hands on you, &gt;&gt; but we're here to assist. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Listen.

Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I appreciate the five of you. &gt;&gt; Listen, he says, "Oh, if the great holy church only realize its power to do these things, but there's so much doubt and fear and trembling, wondering if it will, COULD IT HAPPEN?" &gt;&gt; BETHL TABERNACLE AS LONG AS THAT EXISTS, THE CHURCH CAN NEVER STAND UPRIGHT. &gt;&gt; And when every talk of FEAR IS VANISHED AND THE HOLY SPIRIT IS COMPLETELY in control of the church, THEN ALL FEARS ARE GONE. AND THE CHURCH HAS THE POWER, WHAT POWER? THE AUTHORITY &gt;&gt; TO POSSESS AND CLAIM WHAT BELONGS TO YOU TONIGHT. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. JANUARY 14TH, 2026. EXERCISE YOUR [screaming] AUTHORITY, CHURCH. &gt;&gt; HE SAID THAT CHURCH HAS THE POWER. SEE WHY? THEY HAVE EVERYTHING THAT HEAVEN OWNS. HALLELUJAH. [screaming] BEHIND THEM. &gt;&gt; Remember he TOLD PETER, HALLELUJAH, WHATSOEVER YOU BIND ON EARTH SHALL BE BOUND IN HEAVEN. WHATSOEVER YOU LOOSE ON EARTH SHALL BE LOOSED IN HEAVEN. WHAT DOES THAT? THE [screaming] REVELATION. &gt;&gt; IT'S THE REVELATION THAT GIVES US AUTHORITY. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; Cuz in that moment, Peter didn't have the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; It was simply knowing who he was. &gt;&gt; He said, "They're ambassadors to the throne." Absolutely. An ambassador of Christ has authority and everything that Christ owns belong to that ambassador. Somebody say amen. &gt;&gt; And he said, "Go ye into all the world. Ye are my witnesses after the Holy Ghost is come on you." And what is a witness? It is an ambassador is to come and witness something. The whole power OF HEAVEN IS RIGHT in your hands. My then the prophet comes and says, "Oh my, THERE'S ENOUGH POWER IN THIS CHURCH TO CREATE A WORLD AND GO LIVE ON IT." WHAT KIND [screaming] OF POWER? AUTHORITY. &gt;&gt; HE'S NOT TALKING ABOUT, "HALLELUJAH, JUST GOING TO CREATE ANOTHER EARTH." But he's TALKING ABOUT CREATE ANOTHER WORLD WITHIN YOUR SITUATION. &gt;&gt; AMEN. This is the part I love. How many believe you're sitting under fruitful ministry? &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm not talking about brother Brandham. I'm talking about Bethl Tabernacle. &gt;&gt; How many believe you're sitting under fruitful ministry? &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Okay. He said the whole power of heaven is right behind is right in your hands. He says, "Oh, why do we sit and the church is barren and we set dormant? Is because that we don't recognize these things. &gt;&gt; If we believe we are under a fruitful ministry, we shouldn't be barren." &gt;&gt; Come musicians, come on. I'm closing. Who are you tonight? &gt;&gt; We going to spend time continuously calling out the enemy tonight. H. But I want to give you a little insight in deliverance. Hallelujah. I'm gonna give you a little insight in deliverance. Once you tell the enemy, you denounce him, you don't want to be bothered in this way anymore, he has to release. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Whatever the sickness, whatever the problem, once you speak to it, Hallelujah. And you say, in the name of Jesus, I don't want this in my body anymore. It has to let go. In the name of Jesus, it has to let go. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. But the thing of it is the PROPHET OF GOD, HE said one of THE GREATEST THINGS, TWO things we HAVE IS A COMMITTAL AND A CONFESSION. &gt;&gt; AND ONCE YOU HALLELUJAH, CONFESS AND COMMIT IT TO GOD. SATAN IS POWERLESS. &gt;&gt; BUT YOU GOT TO WANT TO GET RID OF IT. YOU GOT TO WANT TO SAY ENOUGH IS ENOUGH. &gt;&gt; I'M TIRED OF STRUGGLING. I'M TIRED OF FIGHTING THE SAME BATTLE. TONIGHT. I WANT MY JOY BACK. &gt;&gt; GLORY. AMEN. Come on. Praise God. &gt;&gt; I want my joy back. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I want my joy back. &gt;&gt; That's right. [snorts] &gt;&gt; I've been serving the Lord a long time. I got a right to be happy about it. &gt;&gt; I got a right to come to church and rejoice in his goodness. No matter WHAT THE BATTLE MAY LOOK LIKE, TAKE AUTHORITY OVER IT RIGHT NOW IN THE NAME OF JESUS. AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Take authority out of it. &gt;&gt; DON'T WALK ABOUT HERE SAYING, "OH, I SHOULD HAVE GOT PRAYED FOR." NO, YOU SHOULD HAVE SPOKE UP. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; YOU SHOULD HAVE SPOKE UP. &gt;&gt; GOD TOLD MOSES, "WHY YOU CRYING TO ME? SPEAK AND MOVE FORWARD." &gt;&gt; HE DIDN'T HAVE [screaming] TIME TO PRAY FOR 2 MILLION, 4 MILLION PEOPLE. HE SAID, "SPEAK AND MOVE FORWARD." &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; We've been in church too long. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Settling for defeat. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's time for us to exercise our authority. &gt;&gt; In this very moment, in this very time, young people, the things you are struggling with right now Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Whatever that struggle, that struggle may be lust, &gt;&gt; that struggle may be pornography. &gt;&gt; That struggle may be uh insecurities, it may be anxiety, &gt;&gt; I'm saying to you tonight, &gt;&gt; call it by name. &gt;&gt; And say, I rebuke you right now in the name of Jesus. Call it by name. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; SEE, DELIVERANCE IS NOT JUST A COMING AND A FALLING DOWN TO THE ALTAR. DELIVERANCE IS IDENTIFYING YOUR ENEMY AND THEN TELLING HIM, "I DON'T WANT YOU IN MY LIFE ANYMORE." &gt;&gt; CHURCH, if you notice, when Jesus got the legion, he didn't just PRAY FOR HIM. HE ASKED HIM A QUESTION. WHAT IS YOUR NAME? &gt;&gt; IDENTIFY YOURSELF. IDENTIFY THAT SPIRIT. CALL IT OUT. &gt;&gt; CALL IT OUT. BE SPECIFIC. GOD IS INTENTIONAL. AMEN. &gt;&gt; You have authority over it. &gt;&gt; And they got to [music] respond. Once you call it by name, it's identified. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. It can't sit that dormant anymore. Hallelujah. [music] Brother Brad, I've seen it too many times in church where the anointing is moving. Spirits hide. &gt;&gt; They hide and they sit there because we're a calm [music] church. We're a nice church. BUT I WANT TO SAY THIS, HALLELUJAH, ABRUPTLY AND BOLDLY. I SEE YOU, SATAN. &gt;&gt; I see you. Let go of your fears right now. Let it go. Let it go. Rejoice in him. Let it go. You know what you want God to do? CALL IT BY NAME. Identify it and say, "Get out of my body. GET OUT OF MY LIFE. GET OUT OF MY MIND. This is not that you may be afraid. No, we're exercising our authority for true deliverance. Hallelujah. While the Holy Spirit is moving. Hallelujah. By the grace of God, I can move to this room and touch different ones. [music] Hallelujah. Who are going through. BUT I DON'T WANT TO DO THAT. I want you to want God to do it. NOT BROTHER DIGGS TO DO IT. I want YOU TO WANT GOD TO DO IT. BECAUSE WHEN I'M GONE, GOD WILL STILL BE HERE. HE'LL BE HERE NEXT WEEK AND THE WEEK AFTER THAT AND THE WEEK AFTER THAT. IF YOU COULD JUST TAP IN TO GOD, HE WILL DEAL WITH YOUR STRUGGLES TONIGHT. While you're waiting on the altar call, the altar's in your heart. Let God meet you right there in your seat. Hallelujah. Right there in your seat. Let him meet you right there in your seat. Hallelujah. Right there in your seat. Hallelujah. God has [music] come to recover and restore. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; In the name of Jesus. So let's go &gt;&gt; in the name of Jesus. [music] &gt;&gt; For months, for weeks, for years, Satan's been STRIPPING YOU FROM YOUR JOY. GET YOUR JOY BACK. Fall back in love with the Lord. It belongs to you. It belongs to you. It belongs to you. Hallelujah. It belongs to you. Hallelujah. [snorts] It's connecting. Just reach up and grab it right now in the name of Jesus. Hallelujah. In the [music] name of Jesus. Hallelujah. We take authority over the enemy right now. Satan, you've been you've been troubled and you've been trying to make him doubt, but we bind your lies right now in the name of Jesus Christ. Hallelujah. And let the spirit of love overflow in this house against every trial, against every situation, against every struggle. Lord, let the love of God prevail through the authority as a son right now in Jesus Christ. And let it overflow. Let it overflow. Let it move from you to you &gt;&gt; down to the children. Hallelujah. Let the love of God overflow. WE TAKE AUTHORITY OVER THE TRIAL RIGHT NOW. &gt;&gt; And we speak deliverance in this house. [music] &gt;&gt; We can praise him. YOU DON'T HAVE TO TELL ME. GOD ALREADY KNOWS. Glor [music] King of glory. [singing] &gt;&gt; Just want to be &gt;&gt; Come on, church.
