[50:28] you'll do that Lord then everything will
[50:30] be just fine so we commit it to you in
[50:33] Jesus name amen God bless you friends
[50:36] you you can be
[50:38] seated amen you can be seated Daniel oh
[50:42] you are seated oh okay yeah
[50:45] okay praise the Lord happy to have him
[50:48] and paage here paage with us tonight
[50:50] amen so sister Deborah's called in some
[50:53] reinforcements amen praise the Lord
[50:57] all right Psalms 103 I just want to read
[50:59] that for you again bless the Lord oh my
[51:03] soul and all that is within me bless His
[51:08] holy name so I'm I'm taking the title
[51:11] tonight we bless his name and there's a
[51:14] number of songs that we actually sing
[51:17] along those lines we bless your name I
[51:20] bless your name I'll speak of those in
[51:22] just in a moment but I think that it is
[51:26] important
[51:27] to just acknowledge that it's not just
[51:31] his name but it's His holy name amen
[51:34] because you know as brother brandham
[51:36] talks about you know when he was dealing
[51:39] with his Brethren there and some of them
[51:41] trinitarians and some of them Oneness
[51:43] and Jesus only and he said you know um
[51:47] you baptize in the name of Jesus only
[51:51] and you think that you're better off
[51:53] than someone baptizing in titles Father
[51:55] Son and Holy Ghost
[51:57] and he said ' but you say 'well we
[51:58] baptize in the name of Jesus only and he
[52:00] said' but he said Jesus who he said I am
[52:05] personally acquainted with several
[52:07] jesuses we would say that's Jesus
[52:10] because that's that's the way it's
[52:11] spelled in Spanish but brother Brandon
[52:13] was meaning that he personally was
[52:16] acquainted with people around the world
[52:19] many of them who had the name Jesu s so
[52:24] you know maybe we need to be a little
[52:25] more clear
[52:27] uh whose name it is we're baptizing
[52:29] we're not just baptizing in the name of
[52:31] Jesus but we believe that there was a
[52:33] man by the name of Jesus of Nazareth and
[52:36] we believe that he was the Christ the
[52:38] son of the Living God and that's what
[52:40] Peter believed and that's what we
[52:41] believe amen and I think I like to make
[52:44] that distinction that that's exactly
[52:47] what we believe because that's what
[52:49] Believers believe it's what Christians
[52:51] believe around the world I have I have
[52:54] been abroad I was I was in Syria and
[52:58] winding my way back through old Damascus
[53:00] some of those narrow streets and we
[53:03] encountered a group of people very fine
[53:06] people and they were witnessing and they
[53:09] were singing songs they had a very Godly
[53:11] appearance a very Godly humble way about
[53:14] them uh but they were Disciples of
[53:17] John and that blew that blew my mind I
[53:19] thought wait I didn't know there was
[53:21] such a thing and there you find that of
[53:24] all the Disciples of John
[53:27] of John the Baptist that we find you
[53:30] know John and Andrew of all of his
[53:32] disciples were the only ones who ended
[53:34] up taking off after Jesus and so so you
[53:38] say well what happened to all the rest
[53:39] of them you remember the disciples you
[53:41] know even came across a group of people
[53:44] and they were preaching in jesus' name
[53:45] but they weren't with Jesus and so you
[53:48] know you have all of these various
[53:50] things that are close they're
[53:52] approximations they're near to the truth
[53:55] they're close to to the truth but you
[53:57] know I I I just I'm just this way if God
[54:01] has a truth then I want to believe that
[54:05] truth I want to believe the truth not
[54:08] just a truth but I want to believe the
[54:11] truth and so we realize okay brother I
[54:15] might I might hit a high gear and hit
[54:16] two of them yeah amen praise the Lord
[54:19] now I also might preach longer and it'll
[54:20] be your fault okay you heard it all
[54:24] right so we find that that you know in
[54:28] the day and hour that we live in you
[54:31] have plenty of things that are close uh
[54:34] and and I'm not here to disparage
[54:36] something that's close Jesus said of
[54:38] that group who were who were not with
[54:40] him and he said well anybody who you
[54:43] know who's who's for me could hardly be
[54:45] against me so just leave them alone let
[54:48] them do what they're doing but follow
[54:50] thou me and I just I like to know that
[54:53] I've heard his voice today to say follow
[54:55] thou me say well but you weren't you
[54:57] weren't there 2,000 years ago but I have
[55:00] his word and that's exactly what I'm
[55:03] following and I don't allow any man-made
[55:06] interpretation to pull me off of any
[55:09] standard that he laid I like the truth
[55:12] the whole truth and nothing but the
[55:14] truth no matter what it calls for in my
[55:17] life no matter what I might have to
[55:19] surrender give up walk away from change
[55:22] have changed for me I just say Lord by
[55:25] whatever means necessary
[55:28] amen I was walking in the bridge today
[55:30] saying that to the Lord I I said Lord I
[55:32] want to be like job I want to I I don't
[55:35] want to necessarily want job's
[55:37] sufferings but I do want to have this
[55:39] testimony that I know my redeemer liveth
[55:42] and I know that on that day I will see
[55:45] him and I said Lord I want to see you I
[55:48] know you live I know you're alive and I
[55:51] know you're in your word and I know you
[55:53] have an exact word for this day as you
[55:56] have had in every day and I want to have
[55:59] that exact word I don't want an
[56:02] approximation I don't want something
[56:04] close I don't want something that's
[56:06] almost there I want something that spot
[56:09] on the whole word of God as Paul said I
[56:13] have not shunned to declare unto you the
[56:16] whole counsel of
[56:19] God the popular gospel song that was
[56:23] actually inspired by this psalm
[56:26] uh that we read in Psalms
[56:29] 1031 bless the Lord oh my soul and all
[56:31] that is within me bless His holy name
[56:33] according to uh him.org gospel musician
[56:37] Andre Crouch who we most of us would be
[56:39] familiar with composed a song for The
[56:42] Familiar opening phrase of Psalms
[56:45] 103 uh one of the most uh and in fact is
[56:49] the most loved Old Testament hymns about
[56:53] God's love and compassion for his people
[56:56] people is the 103rd Psalm and it goes on
[57:00] to say Crouch retains the conventional
[57:03] Hebrew custom of addressing oneself as
[57:07] my soul and the phrase he goes on in his
[57:11] song you've heard it we sing it bless
[57:14] the Lord all my soul and all that is
[57:16] within me bless His holy name and then
[57:19] we you know come around the corner and
[57:22] we and we follow the music for he has
[57:25] done great things you remember he has
[57:28] done great things and so so we realize
[57:31] that he has done great things then
[57:33] becomes a summary reference to all of
[57:37] the uh of the might to all of of all the
[57:41] good that God has done down Through the
[57:43] Ages and and this was what Andre Crouch
[57:46] wanted to keep pure uh to show exactly
[57:50] how he felt about this 103rd Psalm that
[57:53] it was a reference to all the mighty
[57:56] deeds and all of the compassionate Deeds
[57:58] of the Lord that are in fact described
[58:02] in Psalms 103 had we kept reading the
[58:05] the characteristics of God uh concerning
[58:09] God forgives and God heals and God
[58:13] provides and God redeems and God is
[58:17] gracious and God is patient we got any
[58:19] Witnesses tonight and God is loving and
[58:22] God is just all good things come down
[58:26] from above from the Father of Lights
[58:29] amen amen so I think that that just as
[58:34] as David was careful to say to us that
[58:39] it's not just his name but it's His holy
[58:43] name and I think that we ought to have a
[58:47] a loud voice in this day to say we're
[58:50] not just here preaching his word but we
[58:53] have the full measure of his word we
[58:56] have all the word we have the original
[59:00] word we don't just have a word we don't
[59:04] just have uh Theory and Doctrine and
[59:08] beliefs but we actually have a living
[59:11] presence amen and that's the other half
[59:15] that so often uh can be missing brother
[59:17] Bram talks about how I think it was
[59:20] India or it might have been South Africa
[59:22] I can't remember for sure when he's he's
[59:24] there and he's he's talking about a a
[59:26] minister there a very fine man very
[59:29] Godly man and he was ex extremely
[59:33] sincere almost sincere all if if you can
[59:36] imagine this almost sincere to a fault
[59:39] because and you'll understand a little
[59:41] bit more as I explain it as brother Ram
[59:43] told the
[59:44] story that this man had you know such a
[59:48] a singular vision for winning
[59:51] souls and he had been there for 30 30
[59:56] years and he had won one
[1:00:01] soul and when he when brother brandham
[1:00:03] is standing on the platform and here
[1:00:05] comes someone up and the discernment
[1:00:08] begins to work and brother Brandon
[1:00:10] begins to see done into their life and
[1:00:12] that minister is standing behind him on
[1:00:14] the platform and brother Brandon can
[1:00:17] hear him starting to say under his
[1:00:19] breath oh lord for that Soul oh for that
[1:00:22] Soul oh for that soul and he was sincere
[1:00:24] he meant it he's weep
[1:00:26] yeah he's
[1:00:28] broken and and so brother brandom is
[1:00:30] going to use that story to illustrate as
[1:00:33] Paul said I came not to you in word only
[1:00:37] amen but I came also in power and
[1:00:39] demonstration because it was the power
[1:00:41] and demonstration of the word that that
[1:00:44] man was missing and was his mind was not
[1:00:47] open to he was very sincerely trying to
[1:00:51] save Souls where there's no fault you
[1:00:54] can place in that but you know but he
[1:00:57] was missing the other part and here he
[1:00:59] is 30 years and he's got one and brother
[1:01:01] brandham in a matter of minutes has
[1:01:04] thousands amen amen and and and the
[1:01:07] prophet turns and and he he comes from
[1:01:10] Beyond that he says God never called a
[1:01:14] man to work in the field for 30 years to
[1:01:17] gain One
[1:01:19] Soul amen you understand so so you can
[1:01:23] have ever so good of an intention you
[1:01:26] can be ever so sincere your motive and
[1:01:29] your objective can be spot on but you
[1:01:33] need the whole councel of God you need
[1:01:37] all the word of God I'm so glad God has
[1:01:40] sent in this hour the entire
[1:01:43] Council not only the correct teaching
[1:01:46] but power and demonstration I'm here to
[1:01:47] tell you there is power and
[1:01:49] demonstration in the message that we
[1:01:52] follow and there's nothing like it for
[1:01:55] breaking the grip of the devil in
[1:01:58] people's
[1:02:00] lives he has done great things Isaiah 57
[1:02:05] and 15 let's have that one sister Esther
[1:02:08] wasn't sure if that was Zoe Zoe's right
[1:02:10] there sister Esther okay uh Isaiah
[1:02:18] 57:15 for thus saith the high and lofty
[1:02:22] one that inhabiteth eternity
[1:02:27] whose name
[1:02:29] is I dwell in the high and holy place
[1:02:35] with him also that is of a contrite and
[1:02:40] humble Spirit to revive the spirit of
[1:02:43] the humble and to revive the heart of
[1:02:47] the contrite ones so this is a holy God
[1:02:51] who has a holy name who lives in a holy
[1:02:55] place
[1:02:56] who I would I think it's fair to say he
[1:02:59] loves
[1:03:04] Holiness we sing the song in prisoners
[1:03:08] chains with bleeding
[1:03:10] Stripes Paul and Silas prayed that
[1:03:15] night and in their pain began to sing
[1:03:20] their chains were loosed and they were
[1:03:22] free amen I bless your name name I bless
[1:03:27] your name I give you
[1:03:30] honor I give you
[1:03:33] praise I suggest to all of us here
[1:03:37] today and this is really the the Crux of
[1:03:41] my burden and I'm surprised that I'm
[1:03:43] coming to it so quickly but I just can't
[1:03:44] stay back from it I'm going to suggest
[1:03:48] to us all
[1:03:49] today that there truly is no better way
[1:03:54] to bless his name name His holy name
[1:03:58] than to live a holy
[1:04:04] life that's my premise that's the burden
[1:04:08] of my heart that's the burden of the
[1:04:10] word for the people in this service in
[1:04:14] this building over the internet and
[1:04:17] whoever might hear it at a different
[1:04:19] time there is truly no better way to
[1:04:22] bless His holy name than to live a holy
[1:04:26] life amen a holy life for him whose very
[1:04:31] name is Holy is that asking too much
[1:04:36] no is that an infringement upon your
[1:04:39] rights is that a
[1:04:40] burden is that a trifle that we're too
[1:04:43] busy and we and we're you know and it
[1:04:46] might cost us too much I'm here to tell
[1:04:48] you sing you bless his name but if you
[1:04:51] really want to bless his name his name
[1:04:53] is Holy and you bless his name by
[1:04:56] allowing his holy life to make you
[1:05:01] holy no wonder as we were talking about
[1:05:04] last Sunday he was back in the
[1:05:06] eternities as a lamb interceding we we
[1:05:08] talked about that a little bit how that
[1:05:11] we we were actually concluding there and
[1:05:13] again I'm not preaching on that tonight
[1:05:15] but I just by stir you up by way of
[1:05:17] remembrance that I said to you he was
[1:05:20] interceding from the eternities well
[1:05:22] where else would he be interceding
[1:05:24] because the Bible say that in his
[1:05:26] suffering he would see his seed and
[1:05:28] where did he first see you and I in the
[1:05:30] eternities AM we made the point that the
[1:05:33] that the eternities are not a memory
[1:05:35] lane for his family it's not a museum
[1:05:38] it's not a shrine where he goes through
[1:05:40] and looks at all his great Champions uh
[1:05:44] the eternities is where the more real of
[1:05:47] his family exist and that's you and
[1:05:50] that's me absolutely friends there's
[1:05:53] there is a more real version of me than
[1:05:56] me there's a more real version of you
[1:05:58] than you Hallelujah there's a version
[1:06:02] that was with God long before you were
[1:06:04] here and you'll go back to that version
[1:06:06] again
[1:06:10] Hallelujah a different version that he
[1:06:12] sees of me he sees it as
[1:06:16] me so I come back to my question I come
[1:06:19] back around I may come to it several
[1:06:21] times tonight I want it to penetrate
[1:06:24] deeply in your heart and Minds tonight
[1:06:26] would there be a better
[1:06:29] way to bring honor to his
[1:06:33] word than to be transformed by the
[1:06:36] renewing of your mind by the word a
[1:06:40] little more and a little more and a
[1:06:43] little more every
[1:06:46] day you want to say that to the Lord
[1:06:48] today Lord a little more today a little
[1:06:50] more tomorrow a little more the next day
[1:06:52] I want to get more and more like you I
[1:06:54] want to come more more into that image
[1:06:56] bring me this day a little closer to the
[1:07:00] image that you saw of me in the
[1:07:03] eternities yes Lord I'm here to tell you
[1:07:06] something friends that transforming
[1:07:08] power is found in the exact same place
[1:07:11] and in the exact same way as it was when
[1:07:14] it appeared in Genesis it was God's
[1:07:17] spoken word of
[1:07:20] command we were you know we've been
[1:07:22] teaching about how that the that the new
[1:07:25] bir birth brings a new birth
[1:07:29] nature and the nature of of course we
[1:07:32] know that the nature of sin remains in
[1:07:34] the flesh and in the spirit thank God
[1:07:37] I'm a Triune being Hallelujah that I
[1:07:40] know that sin remains in my flesh I get
[1:07:43] it I know I'm
[1:07:45] sorry it does in you
[1:07:47] too it hang it it's still in my spirit I
[1:07:50] still have to keep control of my
[1:07:52] conscience and my memory and my
[1:07:54] reasoning my my imaginations I'm sorry
[1:07:58] it's that way friends but we're going to
[1:08:00] get out of here one of these days we
[1:08:02] won't have to put up with it forever I'm
[1:08:04] already starting to the transition I've
[1:08:06] already been
[1:08:08] transformed by the power of the word of
[1:08:11] God don't tell me it's not for me it's
[1:08:14] changed my whole life God don't tell me
[1:08:18] you don't need it because you're not
[1:08:20] stronger than me I had to have it to get
[1:08:23] my nature transformed how you hope to do
[1:08:26] it see we're all in this thing together
[1:08:30] friends
[1:08:32] see so I I do have the nature of sin
[1:08:35] remaining in My Flesh and in my spirit
[1:08:37] but now my spirit is Under New
[1:08:40] Management there's a there's a new owner
[1:08:43] and he's got a different Vision he's got
[1:08:45] a different nature he's got a nature
[1:08:47] from above see above where good things
[1:08:52] uh come down where where from where come
[1:08:55] comes down all good things I want to say
[1:08:58] to you today nothing that raises up from
[1:09:00] this broken world is any good unless
[1:09:03] it's something God
[1:09:06] planted I don't care what it is how
[1:09:08] alluring how much you think you got to
[1:09:10] have it if God didn't plant it and it
[1:09:12] grew up out of this Earth it will kill
[1:09:14] you the only good things come down from
[1:09:18] above from the Father of Lights in whom
[1:09:20] is no Shadow or variableness no turning
[1:09:24] he's Dependable Rel reliable and
[1:09:26] trustworthy and honest and you can trust
[1:09:27] him with your very
[1:09:30] existence there's nothing more valuable
[1:09:32] than your Eternal destination amen you
[1:09:35] don't own any you will never own
[1:09:37] anything more valuable than that oh see
[1:09:41] when this Earth has gone to Ash and
[1:09:42] Cinder I'll still be
[1:09:44] alive I'm I'm going to be somewhere when
[1:09:47] this when this Earth is rocking on fire
[1:09:50] I will be somewhere I want to say Lord I
[1:09:52] want to be around your throne I I want
[1:09:56] to be in the bosom of Abraham I want to
[1:09:58] be where the redeemed are I want to walk
[1:10:00] among those that Joshua the high priest
[1:10:03] saw in Zechariah 3 he could see those
[1:10:06] great Champions walking around and he
[1:10:08] said all you got to do is keep my word
[1:10:10] and keep my judgments and I'll grant for
[1:10:12] you to walk around these that you see I
[1:10:16] want to make it friends I want to be
[1:10:18] there hallelujah
[1:10:23] amen so we f find then that this new
[1:10:27] nature fortunately it has direct access
[1:10:30] to the still Fallen flesh and spirit to
[1:10:32] bring it subject to the ways of the word
[1:10:35] and that is that is that is precisely
[1:10:39] why that is precisely why only the
[1:10:42] message of the hour even has the ability
[1:10:46] to fully accomplish redemption in the
[1:10:48] individual am see no one will ever say
[1:10:53] that I I shunned as Paul said in Acts 20
[1:10:55] that I no one's ever going to say I son
[1:10:57] to declare the whole counsel of God you
[1:11:00] know and I can say as Paul went on to
[1:11:02] say if you drop on down around 30 some
[1:11:04] odd verse there Paul went on to say I
[1:11:07] cease not to warn every every man night
[1:11:10] and day with tears I want to say it
[1:11:13] again today as clear as I possibly can
[1:11:15] only the message of Malachi 4 carries
[1:11:18] redemption in
[1:11:20] it that's that's not my decision that's
[1:11:23] the word if if that wasn't true he
[1:11:26] wouldn't have needed to send
[1:11:28] him and and he didn't send him because
[1:11:31] because you know somebody thought it was
[1:11:33] a good idea he arrived because he got
[1:11:35] had promised that's what he would do and
[1:11:38] that's what he
[1:11:39] did people say to me what what is this
[1:11:42] thing you call a message I just say just
[1:11:43] what God
[1:11:45] promised not more than that it's just
[1:11:47] what God promised to do and he did it we
[1:11:49] have it
[1:11:51] see it has to have the message of the
[1:11:54] hour that's been true in every hour it
[1:11:56] has to have the message of any hour say
[1:11:59] why is brother Jason why is that true
[1:12:02] because the spoken word of God is the
[1:12:06] original seed that all life and all
[1:12:09] creation came from it's the only way the
[1:12:13] the original seed of life is the only
[1:12:16] way to get back to to from where we fell
[1:12:19] from Brother Bram made that constantly
[1:12:22] it's such a simple argument it it it it
[1:12:26] it Stupify the learned and the doctors
[1:12:29] of divinity and brother Brandon would
[1:12:31] just say know if if we if we broke
[1:12:34] everything by just denying one word how
[1:12:37] you ever hope to get back with a denial
[1:12:40] of 300 you know three four 500 Words and
[1:12:43] and only one word it only took one word
[1:12:46] unbelief of unbelief
[1:12:49] amen my goodness friends how else do you
[1:12:52] imagine God will have a kingdom of
[1:12:54] saints and all of them will have the
[1:12:56] nature that Jesus had if he doesn't have
[1:12:59] a word to accomplish that
[1:13:02] see because people will you know decide
[1:13:06] to do
[1:13:08] better you know because Humanity uh will
[1:13:11] collectively somehow determine to become
[1:13:14] better
[1:13:15] people you know I I I I I come back to
[1:13:18] my question again can anybody tell me a
[1:13:21] better way to bless His holy name than
[1:13:25] than to conduct ourselves in
[1:13:28] Holiness can anybody tell me if I was
[1:13:31] eoy this morning that that tonight Edy
[1:13:34] Smith he would say is there anybody in
[1:13:36] the building come on
[1:13:39] amen amen who can tell me a better
[1:13:42] way to bless His holy
[1:13:45] name than by
[1:13:48] allowing by you being willing and
[1:13:51] allowing his Holiness to live and move
[1:13:56] through
[1:13:58] you there's such a retreat of Holiness
[1:14:02] today and that's sad and that's not to
[1:14:06] be because he he didn't Retreat from
[1:14:10] being a holy
[1:14:11] God he doesn't Retreat from having a
[1:14:14] holy word there's no retreat of the Holy
[1:14:18] Ghost amen you understand he he's never
[1:14:22] going to have a different title than
[1:14:24] that Holy
[1:14:26] Ghost and and that's how brother Brandon
[1:14:28] would try to reason with those
[1:14:30] Pentecostal ladies who would come to
[1:14:32] church in a Sunday outfit but then be in
[1:14:35] their yard cut and their grass uh
[1:14:37] half-dressed
[1:14:38] and claim to be a Christian and and
[1:14:41] brother Brandon would he it go back to
[1:14:43] his little sassafras hillbilly Kentucky
[1:14:45] way and just ask a simple stupid
[1:14:50] question
[1:14:51] sister remember he's a holy
[1:14:56] Spirit not a filthy spirit I mean is
[1:15:00] that right or is that not right is that
[1:15:03] true or is that not true how can someone
[1:15:06] say I have the Holy Spirit and their
[1:15:09] life isn't
[1:15:11] holy amen that's right you know amen I
[1:15:16] would say today as we sing that song in
[1:15:19] prisoners chains I would say today that
[1:15:21] if you were in prisoners chains of the
[1:15:23] enemy tonight bless His holy name and
[1:15:26] knowing fully that you have committed
[1:15:29] yourself to a holy life and and and that
[1:15:32] would be then blessing His holy name
[1:15:34] would be a really good way to get out of
[1:15:36] those chains I would say it again
[1:15:39] tonight I don't care what kind of chains
[1:15:40] of the enemy you might be in tonight
[1:15:43] start blessing His holy name only make
[1:15:45] sure that your heart condemns you not
[1:15:48] that you know that there's a life
[1:15:50] embedded behind that Holy
[1:15:53] Name see
[1:15:56] cuz I promise you that the devil will
[1:15:58] know if he needs to worry if you start
[1:16:01] blessing the the name of the
[1:16:06] Lord people do it all the time they
[1:16:09] start blessing the name of the Lord the
[1:16:12] devil's no more worried about that than
[1:16:14] anything sons of ska found that out the
[1:16:16] hard way am acts acts 1913 to16 then
[1:16:21] certain of the Vagabond Jews Exorcist
[1:16:23] took upon them to call over for them
[1:16:25] which had evil spirits the name of the
[1:16:27] Lord Jesus saying we adure You by Jesus
[1:16:30] whom Paul preacheth and there were seven
[1:16:32] sons seven sons of onekea a Jew and
[1:16:36] chief of the priest which did so and the
[1:16:39] evil spirit answered and said Jesus I
[1:16:42] know Paul I know but who are
[1:16:48] you and the men and the man in whom the
[1:16:52] evil spirit was leapt on them and
[1:16:56] overcame them this is seven on one and
[1:16:59] and prevailed against them so that they
[1:17:02] fled out of that house naked and wounded
[1:17:06] amen sometimes we get our toet tapping
[1:17:09] when our hands clapping and we we we we
[1:17:11] we love that song Bless That Wonderful
[1:17:13] Name of Jesus we sing it here brother

[1:17:34] that's all
[1:17:35] true that's all true all of those things
[1:17:38] are true but do you but do you know by
[1:17:43] experience that those things are
[1:17:46] true or do you just sing it is it just a
[1:17:50] song you just memorize

[1:18:08] and singing and I promise you the
[1:18:10] devil's jumping up and down dancing and
[1:18:11] singing
[1:18:15] too so the question becomes have you
[1:18:18] memorize lyrics that are even true
[1:18:21] lyrics but do you know by experience
[1:18:24] that those things you're singing about
[1:18:27] are
[1:18:29] true say well I just believe them I I'm
[1:18:31] glad thank you but have you experienced

[1:18:45] name I'm here to tell you I've
[1:18:46] experienced all of those things I know
[1:18:48] he's
[1:18:49] [Applause]
[1:18:51] real Now watch how they knew it in on
[1:18:54] where we're reading in Acts 19 it goes
[1:18:56] on from the sons of ska watch this now
[1:18:58] after the devil beat him to death and
[1:19:00] sent him running
[1:19:01] naked verse
[1:19:04] 17 and this was known to all the Jews
[1:19:07] and Greeks also dwelling at Ephesus and
[1:19:11] fear fell on them all and the name of
[1:19:14] the Lord Jesus was
[1:19:16] magnified now I mean it almost sounds
[1:19:20] like wow this is a tragedy these guys
[1:19:22] got hurt they were trying do a good deed
[1:19:26] and everybody's
[1:19:27] rejoicing they weren't just rejoicing
[1:19:30] watch now that when it talks about fear
[1:19:33] don't think that that's a fear like
[1:19:35] brother R said that does fear of God's
[1:19:37] not fear he'll hurt you he's a loving
[1:19:40] father see it's not fear that he'll hurt
[1:19:42] you it's it's you have a fear that you
[1:19:45] love him and respect him so much he's
[1:19:47] done so much for you that you're afraid
[1:19:49] so much you'll do the least little thing
[1:19:51] that would bring disgrace on him the
[1:19:54] fear the Lord the reverence of the Lord
[1:19:56] the admiration of the Lord that I just I
[1:19:59] just want to be so careful because his
[1:20:01] name is so precious and he paid such a
[1:20:04] heavy price Lord don't let me do
[1:20:06] anything oh I would to God that people
[1:20:08] would have it that way Lord don't let me
[1:20:11] do anything let my life be clean let my
[1:20:14] conversation be just let my actions be
[1:20:17] true Lord let let my reputation be a
[1:20:20] reflection of your
[1:20:23] reputation see and this was known to all
[1:20:26] the Jews and Greeks also dwelling in
[1:20:28] Ephesus and fear fell on them all in the
[1:20:29] name of the Lord Jesus was
[1:20:32] magnified now look what else it did and
[1:20:34] many that believed came and confessed
[1:20:37] and showed their deeds people started
[1:20:39] repenting people started taking
[1:20:41] ownership I need to be more spiritual I
[1:20:44] need to be a better Christian I need to
[1:20:46] pray more I need to I need to love more
[1:20:49] I need to come to church more I God
[1:20:51] loves a contrite we read that God loves
[1:20:53] a contrite heart
[1:20:55] somebody that'll say I've been wrong but
[1:20:57] I don't want to stay
[1:21:02] wrong and many that believed came and
[1:21:04] confessed and showed their deeds 19 many
[1:21:06] of them also which used curious Arts
[1:21:09] brought their books together and burn
[1:21:12] them before all the men these were
[1:21:13] people who were you know you know living
[1:21:16] in church one way and in their home
[1:21:17] another way and they counted the price
[1:21:20] of them and found it 50,000 pieces of
[1:21:23] silver sold mightily grew the word of
[1:21:26] God and
[1:21:28] prevailed all of that happened because
[1:21:31] seven sons of onekea got got uh uh
[1:21:35] humiliated by one devil possessed man
[1:21:38] because the people learned a lesson that
[1:21:40] you can't go around uh proclaiming and
[1:21:42] blessing the name of God if you don't
[1:21:45] have the god inside your life the
[1:21:47] devil's not afraid of that and you go to
[1:21:50] challenge him and you'll have a rough go
[1:21:52] of it but I love the fact that when I
[1:21:54] know that my redeemer liveth and I know
[1:21:57] the power of God is in his word and I
[1:22:00] know I'm a
[1:22:01] Believer God then I'm going to tell you
[1:22:03] something friends it doesn't matter what
[1:22:05] comes into your home what comes into
[1:22:07] your family you have authority in the
[1:22:10] name of Jesus
[1:22:13] Christ hallu Luke chapter 1 couple of
[1:22:16] verses there Luke chapter 1 will'll
[1:22:18] catch verse 49 and
[1:22:21] 5050 for he that is mighty
[1:22:26] hath done to me great things that
[1:22:29] beautiful and holy is his
[1:22:32] name and his Mercy is on them that fear
[1:22:38] Him from generation to generation my
[1:22:42] look at the promise of that give me 49
[1:22:44] again sister Esther for he that is
[1:22:47] mighty hath done to me great things and
[1:22:51] holy is his name verse
[1:22:53] 50 uh and his Mercy is on them that fear
[1:22:58] Him from generation to generation so it
[1:23:01] doesn't even matter how many generations
[1:23:04] have passed since Luke wrote that and
[1:23:07] I'm believing it amen that Mercy just
[1:23:11] passes from generation to generation to
[1:23:14] generation that Holy Name passes from
[1:23:16] generation to generation that Holy
[1:23:19] people with Holy Faith and the Holy
[1:23:21] Ghost passes from generation to
[1:23:23] generation
[1:23:25] amen look at what they conclude in
[1:23:27] Revelation
[1:23:30] 15 Revelation 15 trying to trying to get
[1:23:34] done not hold you too long give me about
[1:23:37] 15 more minutes and we'll start taking
[1:23:38] up prayer
[1:23:39] request Revelation 15 let's start at
[1:23:42] verse
[1:23:44] two and catch 2 three and four and I saw
[1:23:49] as it were a sea of glass mingled with
[1:23:52] fire and them that had gotten the
[1:23:55] victory over the
[1:23:57] Beast and over his image and over his
[1:24:01] Mark now look at all this there's his
[1:24:04] image there's his Mark and over the
[1:24:07] number of his name stand on the sea of
[1:24:11] glass having the harps of
[1:24:14] God and they sing the song of Moses the
[1:24:17] servant of God in the song of the lamb
[1:24:20] saying great and marvelous are thy Works
[1:24:24] Lord Lord God Almighty just and true are
[1:24:27] thy ways Thou King of saints who shall
[1:24:30] not fear thee Oh Lord and glorify thy
[1:24:33] name for thou only art holy for all
[1:24:38] nations shall come and worship before
[1:24:40] thee for thy judgments are made manifest
[1:24:45] 144,000 standing
[1:24:48] here and the song of Moses and there but
[1:24:51] now they become Believers in Messiah cuz
[1:24:54] that was that was always the law of
[1:24:56] Moses anyway the law of Moses wasn't
[1:24:59] sini that was the People's Choice the
[1:25:01] law of Moses was here that the Lord
[1:25:04] shall raise up a prophet like me from
[1:25:08] among your brethren and whoever won't
[1:25:10] hear him will will'll be cut off that
[1:25:12] was the law of Moses see and so that's
[1:25:16] why Joshua could cross over the the the
[1:25:19] Jordan into the promised land and say
[1:25:21] remember the law of Moses what crossing
[1:25:23] of the Holy Ghost and remember Mount SII
[1:25:26] see so that's that that jams up you
[1:25:28] can't make it say that so so that's why
[1:25:30] brother Brandon went back to say the law
[1:25:33] the law that came out of siia that
[1:25:34] wasn't go that was the People's Choice
[1:25:36] brother brandham said it was the most
[1:25:37] rational it was his way of meaning
[1:25:39] irrational thing they ever done he said
[1:25:41] they had a prophet they had the pillar
[1:25:43] of fire they had the Brazen serpent they
[1:25:45] had all of this and they chose a law see
[1:25:50] so that was that was man's doing it was
[1:25:53] not God's doing God had brought him out
[1:25:54] under the pillar of fire and led by a
[1:25:56] prophet under grace and so so we find
[1:26:00] out then that they're standing here uh
[1:26:03] and I saw as it were uh the sea of glass
[1:26:05] this is multitudes of people mingled
[1:26:07] with fire see so theyd come up and
[1:26:09] there's judgment it's mingled with fire
[1:26:10] and them that had gotten the victory
[1:26:12] over the Beast and over his image this
[1:26:14] is how they came up out of the Great
[1:26:16] Tribulation and I'm here to tell you
[1:26:18] there there was a a lot to
[1:26:21] avoid at the end time
[1:26:25] and people
[1:26:26] don't they don't assess that correctly
[1:26:29] they don't weigh that there's a lot to
[1:26:32] be avoided at the end time and they were
[1:26:36] able to they got victory over the Beast
[1:26:39] and over his image see so it wasn't it
[1:26:42] wasn't just the spirit of antichrist but
[1:26:45] it was actually over the mechanical
[1:26:47] image that he built and the prophet said
[1:26:49] that's a World Council of churches
[1:26:51] that's organized
[1:26:53] religion that's
[1:26:55] denominationalism and it doesn't even
[1:26:57] have to be a quote unquote denomination
[1:27:00] it still can be just organized in a an
[1:27:02] organized independent movement yesen you
[1:27:05] know you if you go over here to our mega
[1:27:07] church they don't they don't believe
[1:27:08] they're a denomination if you ask them
[1:27:10] are you denomination they say no we're
[1:27:11] independent but they're part of an
[1:27:13] association that still has a board and
[1:27:16] still has the whole hierarchical uh
[1:27:18] setup of man and still denies the word
[1:27:20] and still uh hatches them out of Dallas
[1:27:22] Theological Seminary
[1:27:24] and I'm here to tell you something
[1:27:26] friends God has called us to more than
[1:27:27] that thank God he's called us to a
[1:27:30] higher order and I and I don't just want
[1:27:33] something that's close to the highest
[1:27:34] order I want the highest
[1:27:36] order I want to be like here I want to
[1:27:39] avoid the spirit of the Antichrist I
[1:27:41] want to avoid his image I want to avoid
[1:27:44] his Mark I want to avoid the number of
[1:27:47] his
[1:27:49] name there's there's a lot of peril
[1:27:51] perilous times if for no other reason
[1:27:54] than all of the pitfalls that are going
[1:27:56] to take mankind to his destruction
[1:27:59] blessed be the name of the Lord for the
[1:28:01] word of this day Hallelujah friends
[1:28:03] where would you go what would you do
[1:28:05] what would you tell your family how
[1:28:07] could you get them home oh my I think
[1:28:11] about it I shiver I say Lord God let me
[1:28:14] double my effort I want to try to tell
[1:28:16] everybody I can even if they don't want
[1:28:18] to hear it I want to tell it to them
[1:28:21] anyway warning them with tears as Paul
[1:28:24] said day and night with
[1:28:28] tears who shall not fear thee verse four
[1:28:30] oh Lord and glorify thy name for thou
[1:28:33] art holy for all nations shall come and
[1:28:36] worship before thee for thy judgments
[1:28:39] are made
[1:28:41] manifest you know it's interesting that
[1:28:45] that you know brother Brandon would try
[1:28:48] to you know as every Prophet would do so
[1:28:52] many prophets were always
[1:28:54] you know mistakenly the people would
[1:28:57] mistakenly you know alter their position
[1:29:00] and you know we found John trying to
[1:29:02] worship them and and even even you know
[1:29:05] the Peter and standing there in the gate
[1:29:07] beautiful and Peter and John and them
[1:29:10] they tried to worship them you remember
[1:29:11] that they tried to worship Paul you
[1:29:13] remember that I mean it's not unusual
[1:29:17] that that great men of God they they
[1:29:19] they try to worship them they try to
[1:29:21] treat them as gods they mankind
[1:29:23] intrinsically knows there's something
[1:29:25] higher than than him and so as soon as
[1:29:28] he sees you know the you know remember
[1:29:30] when Pharaoh when Pharaoh saw Joseph he
[1:29:33] said you know where we could search the
[1:29:35] whole world but where are we going to
[1:29:36] find anyone with the spirit of the Gods
[1:29:39] any more than this guy amen you know and
[1:29:41] and they and they were and then Daniel
[1:29:43] there they built a statue to Daniel and
[1:29:45] told the whole nation you got to bow to
[1:29:47] it and worship
[1:29:48] him see so it's not unusual for these
[1:29:51] kinds of things to happen but you know
[1:29:54] but but as a prophet would describe it
[1:29:57] he would talk about how that that you
[1:30:00] know he he said I am not
[1:30:05] he he had to he had to make that
[1:30:07] statement I am not he and said it in
[1:30:11] that almost like a weird way like what
[1:30:12] kind of talk is that I am not he but
[1:30:15] he's he's got to be a prophet he's got
[1:30:17] to be clear he would say I am not he see
[1:30:21] and then he would talk about the pillar
[1:30:23] of fire the of fire is not he it's the
[1:30:25] anointing that that veils the theophany
[1:30:29] it's just a God in a form see and so so
[1:30:33] and then another time he would come
[1:30:34] along and he would say I am not the son
[1:30:38] of man amen I am a son of man revealing
[1:30:43] the son of man there's only one the son
[1:30:47] of man there's only one
[1:30:50] he
[1:30:51] see and so but but yet a prophet would
[1:30:54] come down and talk about Adam and we
[1:30:57] showed you last Sunday how that Adam you
[1:31:00] know being the first wheat and Jesus
[1:31:02] being the second Adam had come back to
[1:31:04] wheat again except a corn of wheat die
[1:31:07] so now it has went from seed to seed and
[1:31:10] we're being restored back to that he
[1:31:12] said Adam was actually an amateur God
[1:31:16] see he had power of creation uh in his
[1:31:19] word and he he said you know and and God
[1:31:23] didn't even make the Earth you know for
[1:31:25] himself to rule he built the god rules
[1:31:27] the heavens and the universe he built
[1:31:29] the Earth for man to rule this is all
[1:31:31] part of God's expression I don't want to
[1:31:32] get into the trenches of it tonight
[1:31:34] because I'm I'm just trying to preach a
[1:31:35] simple Wednesday night sermon but but as
[1:31:38] a man you know I I I can say to you
[1:31:40] tonight I could just stand up here and
[1:31:42] go I'm not him
[1:31:44] right amen and everybody needs to have
[1:31:48] that humble opinion and say I'm not
[1:31:50] him see but I was buil In His
[1:31:55] Image see and that makes me in the order
[1:32:00] with
[1:32:00] Adam with the potential to be an amateur
[1:32:04] God Amen see now not one you would
[1:32:07] worship because there's only one when
[1:32:10] when the trumpet sounds and the King
[1:32:12] leaves the throne every knee shall bow
[1:32:15] and worship Him amen so this is why
[1:32:19] Jesus would say the Bible would say of
[1:32:22] him that he thought it not robbery
[1:32:24] to be equal with God now not equal to
[1:32:27] God that's something different that
[1:32:28] could be a second a separate thing just
[1:32:30] equal to him but he's not equal to him
[1:32:32] he's equal with him in other words he is
[1:32:34] him there's no difference in him and him
[1:32:38] they're the same him they're just in a
[1:32:40] different form see and so he thought it
[1:32:43] not robbery to be considered equal with
[1:32:46] God he didn't mind he didn't mind when
[1:32:48] the Rich Young Ruler came and called him
[1:32:52] good he he didn't mind being called good
[1:32:55] but he would use that at that moment he
[1:32:58] would use it as what we often call today
[1:33:00] a teachable moment for that young man
[1:33:03] not only for that young man but for the
[1:33:05] whole crowd gathered around him for the
[1:33:07] disciples who were who were at his sight
[1:33:09] in fact is the whole world this is a
[1:33:11] lesson for the whole world this a lesson
[1:33:13] for you and I tonight see teaching that
[1:33:17] he was none other than God himself
[1:33:19] standing in human flesh a he was
[1:33:22] literally a perfection of the son of man
[1:33:25] Ministry the word made flesh and he says
[1:33:28] to him why do you call me
[1:33:30] good see he's trying to he's trying to
[1:33:33] get that young man to come on with that
[1:33:35] Revelation come onen you you just ran up
[1:33:37] here and called me good now hold on
[1:33:39] let's just see if you really know what
[1:33:40] you're
[1:33:41] saying see so why do you call me good
[1:33:46] seeing that there is only one truly and
[1:33:49] fully good and that's God Amen and yet
[1:33:52] you're calling me that see so are you
[1:33:56] young man acknowledging that I am
[1:34:02] he is that what you're saying what about
[1:34:04] you mixed crowd some of you gathered
[1:34:07] around me for the fishes and the
[1:34:09] loaves do you believe that I am he what
[1:34:12] about you my disciples who are sitting
[1:34:15] here recording my words and recording my
[1:34:18] actions what about you tonight bethl
[1:34:21] Tabernacle What About Us in this day who
[1:34:23] do you say this is hallelujah do you do
[1:34:26] you believe if he says I am he say I say
[1:34:29] Amen if he says this is he I say amen
[1:34:34] hallelujah I'm a Believer in who he is
[1:34:37] and he is Holy and his name is Holy and
[1:34:41] I believe in being
[1:34:43] holy
[1:34:45] Hallelujah we who are alive in
[1:34:48] remain do we see him
[1:34:52] today it's a really penetrating question
[1:34:56] do you really see him
[1:34:58] today as more than just a a good man
[1:35:02] amen or just a mere
[1:35:06] Prophet now there's hardly no Christian
[1:35:10] of any Christian Church who would say of
[1:35:14] course I see him as more that's
[1:35:15] unbelievers think that well you know
[1:35:18] those unbelievers might not be as far
[1:35:20] off as you think they are because here
[1:35:23] here he
[1:35:24] is and what do you say of this
[1:35:28] am see do you do you take the message of
[1:35:33] Malachi 4 and think that it's just a
[1:35:36] man's
[1:35:37] opinion do do we look at it like that do
[1:35:40] we believe it was just a good man who
[1:35:42] yeah he was a prophet and yeah he he
[1:35:44] brought some word and had some
[1:35:46] Supernatural That's that is so far
[1:35:50] removed from the description of why
[1:35:54] Malachi 4 would
[1:35:56] come he wouldn't come to entertain
[1:35:59] people he wouldn't come to for people to
[1:36:00] have a smorgus board of truth that you
[1:36:02] can buffet style it and pick whatever
[1:36:04] you want he came before the coming of
[1:36:07] the great and Dreadful day of the Lord
[1:36:10] the whole world is doomed to destruction
[1:36:13] and Malachi 4 is just a temporary
[1:36:16] judicial injunction it's the it's the
[1:36:19] little it's the that little that little
[1:36:21] space of time that brother Bram talks
[1:36:23] about between the sixth and seventh
[1:36:24] trumpet and the sixth and seventh seal
[1:36:26] that little interval of time he's got to
[1:36:29] he's got to stop the you know he's got
[1:36:31] to stop the woes otherwise it's going to
[1:36:33] sweep the Earth of humanity it's got to
[1:36:36] go in Pace the gospel is going to go to
[1:36:38] the Jews the Gentiles are going to be
[1:36:41] cleaned off but before all of that can
[1:36:43] happen I got to stop it hold it I'm
[1:36:45] going to this a temporary injunction
[1:36:47] what are you going to do I'm going to
[1:36:49] drop down quickly I'm going to send
[1:36:50] Elijah with a message and it's going to
[1:36:52] turn the heart to the children back to
[1:36:54] the faith of the fathers and I'm going
[1:36:56] to be able to get them out of here and
[1:36:58] then it can go on forward and that's
[1:37:01] where you and I are
[1:37:03] tonight Hallelujah friends so do we see
[1:37:07] him in his word today not yesterday do
[1:37:09] you see him in the message

[1:37:24] are they life to

[1:43:28] who I'm singing
[1:43:31] to am I so distracted by the world that
[1:43:34] my worship and my praise is just memory
[1:43:37] it's just muscle memory it's just
[1:43:40] tradition Lord there's I don't believe
[1:43:42] in my heart there's one person in here

[1:43:48] comfortable with that we're not
[1:43:49] comfortable with that we want more of
[1:43:52] you Lord so I commit it to you tonight I
[1:43:54] commit this strange little sermon Lord
[1:43:57] you dropped on my heart a couple days
[1:43:59] ago and I've pondered it Lord and it's
[1:44:02] meant a lot to me studying it and I was
[1:44:04] thinking about it today out for my
[1:44:07] walk oh master I just love talking
[1:44:10] things over with you what a privilege it
[1:44:13] is to call on your name and to know your
[1:44:15] presence is right

[1:44:20] who's around who hears or sees what I
[1:44:22] love love you Lord I love you I love
[1:44:25] your word I love your presence I love
[1:44:27] your anointing I want to be exactly like
[1:44:30] you grant it to us Lord we commit it to
[1:44:34] you tonight I commit the word the
[1:44:36] preaching and the hearing of the word
[1:44:38] now Lord it must be heard and then it
[1:44:43] must be recognized as your word and if
[1:44:47] that happens then it must be acted
[1:44:50] upon because we already know we can't
[1:44:53] can't come to the house of God and leave
[1:44:54] the same way we leave better or worse
[1:44:57] and that depends on whether we'll own
[1:44:59] the word that we heard tonight so I pray
[1:45:02] that you will give courage to the people
[1:45:06] give courage to hearts Lord near and far
[1:45:09] in this building young and old out
