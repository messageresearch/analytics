[38:14] is contrary to what is taught or spoken
[38:17] of here just
[38:19] that's crazy hold on just disregard me
[38:22] but stick with your pastor Okay so
[38:26] this morning
[38:29] want to get into the scriptures and I've
[38:32] got a lot of quotes here
[38:34] and I
[38:36] base in most of my thought this morning
[38:41] on a message
[38:43] in 1965 and and north and not
[38:48] and it's one of those things I think
[38:51] it's because of
[38:53] where we're living in time right now
[38:57] that
[38:58] you can pick up these messages that oh I
[39:02] know all about that
[39:04] and a while back the Lord spoke to my
[39:07] heart and says pick this up and read it
[39:09] I said I know all about this and no no
[39:12] said not it's all about the
[39:13] denominations
[39:15] they don't know that they're blind
[39:17] miserable and naked and I don't need to
[39:20] read it read it
[39:23] and and I picked it up and I just
[39:25] started crying
[39:27] Lord I never saw this before and it
[39:30] became a whole new message and there's
[39:32] so many of them
[39:34] because of where we are now and because
[39:37] of what we're facing now you watch when
[39:40] the spirit gets into this word
[39:43] each one will become a new book
[39:47] and I've been preaching for a while on
[39:50] the message
[39:51] um
[39:52] it is the rising of the Sun
[39:55] and I finally told the people back home
[39:57] so that that's not just a message it's a
[40:00] message full of messages
[40:02] and I'm approaching each one of them
[40:06] right now because
[40:08] each message preached is just loaded and
[40:12] full of messages that will speak to you
[40:14] right now right where you're at right
[40:17] with what we're facing right at this
[40:19] time I'm brother Ken's sister Anita good
[40:21] to see you guys
[40:23] further down some of you have I've met
[40:25] and I'd like to meet you all but I some
[40:27] of you have never met so God bless you
[40:29] all
[40:31] okay we're gonna take
[40:33] another look this morning
[40:36] at a scripture
[40:38] which is Hebrews 4 12 and I know
[40:42] we all know that and brother branham's
[40:45] most common reference to that
[40:49] is indiscernment lines right
[40:52] so uh
[40:54] in there
[40:56] there's so much more for us even today
[41:01] with what the spirit of the Lord is
[41:04] doing
[41:06] and
[41:07] what he did in the prophet
[41:10] and what he's doing in us today and I
[41:14] guess that's another thing starting out
[41:17] is
[41:19] taking all of the things that the
[41:21] prophet taught
[41:24] and
[41:25] saying Amen to all of them because he
[41:29] says if you have the Holy Ghost you say
[41:30] Amen to every word of God right
[41:34] well he says
[41:36] well we'll get into that how's that okay
[41:41] so since we're taking a look at Hebrews
[41:44] 12 let's start with Romans chapter 12.
[41:46] okay there it is
[41:48] now this is the whis translation if you
[41:51] ever heard there's a man by the name of
[41:53] Kenneth weast and you use them don't you
[41:56] quite a bit he's and just gifted
[42:00] and
[42:02] if you look at Romans 12 with the KJV
[42:05] why don't you go in your cell phones or
[42:07] your Bibles there
[42:09] and it says I beseech you therefore
[42:12] Brethren by the mercies of God
[42:16] now that beseech in the Greek or when
[42:18] you hear that word beseech that's
[42:20] carries a very strong emotional tie to
[42:24] it in other words there's something
[42:26] in the heart of Paul when he was
[42:28] speaking this saying I'm desperate uh
[42:32] for you
[42:34] to receive what I'm saying now it's just
[42:36] not oh here's a nice thought and take it
[42:39] or leave it no that's not it I'm begging
[42:41] you okay this is something I believe the
[42:45] spirit needs you so that's what he's
[42:46] saying I beseech you therefore brother
[42:48] and by the mercies of God
[42:50] did you present your body as a Living
[42:53] Sacrifice holy acceptable unto God which
[42:58] is your reasonable service and be not
[43:00] conformed to this world
[43:03] but be transformed by the renewing of
[43:05] your mind and now watch what he says
[43:07] here it's amazing that you might prove
[43:11] okay the proof is in the puddin isn't it
[43:13] yeah okay so there's something by doing
[43:17] what he tells us to do that's going to
[43:19] bring something out of my life that
[43:21] proves God is in his word working with
[43:24] me okay
[43:26] that you may prove what is the good and
[43:28] acceptable and perfect will of God now
[43:31] the good old weast translation I
[43:33] therefore beg of you brethren
[43:36] please brother
[43:38] through the instrumentality and
[43:39] aforementioned mercies of God that once
[43:42] by a once for all presentation of your
[43:45] bodies at the disposal of God a
[43:47] sacrifice a living one a Holy One well
[43:52] pleasing
[43:53] your rational sacred service
[43:56] now listen to this this is where
[43:59] I was
[44:01] wondering when he said this how could
[44:03] you come up with this with these but
[44:05] actually if you go back and study some
[44:08] of those Greek words and I'm not a
[44:10] scholar so I'm not
[44:12] but I like to read
[44:15] he's it's an incredible how he brings us
[44:18] out and this is a very accurate in in
[44:21] the Greek that he's translating
[44:23] okay and he says stop assuming an
[44:27] outward expression that does not come
[44:28] from within you
[44:30] don't you love that
[44:32] that's not the real you
[44:34] right that's not the true you why are
[44:35] you acting this way it's like a parent
[44:37] watching over his kid isn't it
[44:40] what happened that way
[44:42] and God has to say that to us in sort of
[44:45] those tones sometimes okay that doesn't
[44:48] represent Who You Are
[44:50] right okay so that's a correction we all
[44:53] take from him
[44:55] okay stop assuming an outward expression
[44:58] that does not come from within you and
[44:59] is not representative of what you are in
[45:02] your inner being
[45:03] how rich is that
[45:06] yeah that's not the real you but it's
[45:08] patterned after this age
[45:10] oh teenagers
[45:12] wake up
[45:14] okay
[45:16] who's the real you
[45:18] and I think that is the age that is
[45:21] critical right
[45:22] who's the real you because you have a
[45:25] Warfare going on inside of you something
[45:28] inside deep inside of you as Jason we
[45:31] got these two Natures fighting within us
[45:33] you know
[45:35] and you know what God's trying to help
[45:37] you
[45:39] and he will identify the true you and
[45:41] when he you hear from your heavenly
[45:44] Father Who I Really Am
[45:47] it's going to help you win a lot more
[45:49] battles
[45:50] and that's what we need in this day okay
[45:53] okay it's not representative what you
[45:55] are in your inner being but it's
[45:57] patterned after this age but change your
[45:59] outward expression to one that comes
[46:01] from within
[46:03] okay and is representative of your inner
[46:07] being
[46:09] by the renewing of your mind resulting
[46:11] in your put into the test what is the
[46:13] will of God
[46:14] the good and well-pleasing and complete
[46:16] will and having found that it meets
[46:18] specifications place your approval on us
[46:21] boy that's rich
[46:23] so much there okay now I have a question
[46:26] okay
[46:29] this is something that God said to his
[46:31] prophet
[46:32] I did that way
[46:38] and it hurt him
[46:40] when he says it to you
[46:43] me
[46:45] hurts me
[46:47] but he has to say it
[46:49] okay oh brother Matt I loved your
[46:51] teaching Wednesday night
[46:53] awesome
[46:56] God bless you I'm Don you're a man
[47:02] okay
[47:03] so the question is
[47:06] uh you can scroll down
[47:14] um
[47:15] what is the need
[47:17] in US
[47:19] that the Lord is working on to make us
[47:21] him
[47:23] manifest in our flesh
[47:25] isn't that our goal isn't up to what the
[47:28] prophet said that the bride would be
[47:30] so if I manifest me
[47:33] and you manifest you were really missing
[47:36] it
[47:39] go on just say oh I'm just me
[47:44] sorry you're still missing it so well it
[47:47] can't be anything but what I am
[47:49] trying to tell you who you really are
[47:52] when you believe me then you'll manifest
[47:54] that
[47:57] yes
[48:01] that's the time that we're in
[48:04] so
[48:06] the bride must be more than just
[48:08] Believers in this day Brothers
[48:14] manifest
[48:15] I believe clear back going into the
[48:18] messages
[48:19] especially after this you know brother
[48:21] Branham says like in the token message
[48:26] I don't care what you believe in As Good
[48:28] As You Are believe until you have that
[48:29] token applied to you all your believing
[48:31] is in vain isn't that sort of a shock
[48:34] because I'll be honest with you I think
[48:37] we've been way too comfortable saying
[48:39] I'm a message believer
[48:41] and he's saying no that's not good
[48:44] enough anymore because he's here to help
[48:46] you do something you can never do
[48:48] yourself
[48:49] and he's helped you I'm here to help you
[48:51] I'm here to do what you can't do and
[48:54] that is love and he says but you've got
[48:56] to make a transition and turn a corner
[48:58] from just being a Believer to be coming
[49:00] up becoming
[49:02] as all through the rest of the message
[49:06] he keeps telling you he says what is the
[49:08] bride she is the manifested word
[49:12] okay so it's not just a believing I
[49:15] believe it but it's becoming that word
[49:17] itself right so here so that's what
[49:20] we're talking about today is this
[49:22] process that the Holy Spirit has in it
[49:25] and from there we go to the next
[49:27] scripture which is Hebrews chapter 10.
[49:30] and verse 14 through 18. now
[49:44] okay Hebrews 10 14 is incredible
[49:49] okay so let's go there
[49:51] this is critical to understand
[49:54] why the prophet preached the way he did
[49:56] but when you see this you will
[49:58] understand that what we are feeding on
[50:00] as a son of man Ministry is a perfect
[50:03] word it's absolutely scriptural it's a
[50:06] hundred percent scriptural and if you
[50:08] see messages that you don't understand
[50:11] I don't understand where that is in the
[50:13] word you just wait and say Lord in your
[50:16] time you'll reveal it to me
[50:19] but I guarantee you this you have to
[50:21] have the right attitude
[50:23] you have to have the attitude that says
[50:25] I know he's right and I'm wrong I know
[50:28] he sees and I don't because if you had
[50:30] the right the wrong attitude which says
[50:33] oh I don't believe that I don't see it
[50:34] in the scripture you'll never see it
[50:37] but you go to God with an open heart and
[50:40] a believing heart and say I don't see it
[50:41] but you know your eyes are more open
[50:43] than mine
[50:45] and I just got this little Canary brain
[50:48] you know and I've waited I've waited 25
[50:51] years
[50:52] for answers in the scripture and all of
[50:54] a sudden they opens it up watch that
[50:57] attitude and watch him do that to you
[50:59] okay so here's one of them that just
[51:01] blessed me incredibly Hebrews chapter
[51:03] 10.
[51:04] verse 14 for by one offering he has
[51:07] perfected forever them that are
[51:08] Sanctified okay
[51:11] now I'll go on just a few verses
[51:14] wherever the Holy Ghost is also a
[51:15] witness to us for after that he said
[51:17] before
[51:18] this is the covenant What Covenant blood
[51:21] Covenant the New Testament is in the New
[51:23] Covenant is in my blood isn't that what
[51:25] Jesus said so here's what the blood is
[51:27] doing are you under the blood
[51:29] here's proof that you are under the
[51:31] blood this is the Covenant I will make
[51:33] with them after those days saith the
[51:34] Lord I will put my Liars laws in their
[51:39] hearts and in their what
[51:43] now the mind is put down
[51:45] too much in this day
[51:48] it's both
[51:50] okay yeah how could you have it in your
[51:52] heart without having it in your mind
[51:54] so he's taken what's out of your mind
[51:56] and putting his word there and that's
[51:58] how you know I'm under the blood
[52:01] because he's writing he's inscribing
[52:03] himself he's inscribing his word in here
[52:06] 's the work of the blood of Jesus right
[52:08] okay
[52:11] and in their minds I will write them and
[52:13] then look what he says in verse 17 read
[52:15] it out loud with me would you and their
[52:17] sins and their iniquities ever remember
[52:19] no more why does he say that there
[52:22] isn't that an interesting place to make
[52:24] that statement
[52:25] it doesn't say anything about walking to
[52:27] the front of the church
[52:30] doesn't say anything about even giving
[52:32] your life to the Lord which is important
[52:34] we know that but it says when I do this
[52:37] when the blood is working and the blood
[52:39] of Christ is effective in your life and
[52:42] he's inscribing his word inside my mind
[52:44] inside my heart then he says
[52:51] exactly how brother Branham taught it
[52:53] because he's
[52:55] seals are open and he says now there's
[52:57] the bride and she's received the word
[52:58] you're perfect
[53:00] right it's because the what is because
[53:03] what he the Holy Spirit did in you here
[53:08] now
[53:11] I was listening to a Christian radio
[53:12] station back in Minneapolis and I looked
[53:15] at this
[53:25] and uh
[53:29] in chapter 10 verse 14 for by one
[53:32] offering he hath perfected
[53:34] in the Greek tensor and this isn't for
[53:37] intellectual purposes but it really
[53:39] means something
[53:42] it's
[53:43] a perfect
[53:45] it's a done deal nothing can be added to
[53:48] it nothing can take away you are
[53:51] perfected by the blood of Jesus okay
[53:53] period done
[53:55] but then the next one okay what does he
[53:58] say
[53:59] okay for by one offering is perfected
[54:02] forever them see the word are sanctified
[54:05] that looks sort of like a past tensey
[54:07] word doesn't it
[54:09] it isn't this is what John
[54:13] okay
[54:15] oh are we okay
[54:18] I still haven't figured myself out
[54:23] is that better
[54:25] okay
[54:27] so again the word Sanctified in the
[54:30] Greek tense is a present progressive
[54:33] continuous thing that never quits
[54:36] isn't that interesting and when I heard
[54:39] that that day I went
[54:43] because that's exactly how brother
[54:45] Brandon preached
[54:48] now look at all of these things he tells
[54:50] you about you he says you're perfect
[54:52] you're spotless you're sinless you never
[54:54] did in the first place you're Justified
[54:56] right isn't that beautiful
[54:58] but I'm not done working with you and
[55:00] don't you forget it
[55:03] can you can both of those abide in me at
[55:06] the same time
[55:07] now it's exactly exactly
[55:11] the wave of the Brother Brad so is he
[55:13] scriptural yeah
[55:15] it's right there in the word doesn't
[55:16] that make you happy
[55:18] perfect word
[55:20] man I love him so isn't it interesting
[55:23] also now think about this
[55:25] it's Those whom he have perfected by his
[55:29] blood
[55:30] only those
[55:33] and the blood perfects because of the
[55:36] token the spirit
[55:38] the word you can't separate the blood
[55:41] from the word can you
[55:43] another one
[55:44] okay so this word of God is working
[55:47] inside of me and those that who are
[55:49] perfected and Justified because they
[55:51] receive that word inside their souls he
[55:54] says you know what I'm going to take
[55:55] that group
[55:57] and I'm going to do something with them
[55:59] I'm going to continue to sanctifying
[56:00] them I'm going to take him Place places
[56:03] that know I can't take anywhere else
[56:06] anybody else
[56:08] isn't that amazing so he's doing
[56:10] something with the bride that he isn't
[56:12] doing with anybody else
[56:14] and the rest of the world will say
[56:15] that's impossible
[56:17] you think you're going to be manifested
[56:19] Son of God oh
[56:21] can you believe that
[56:25] do you think you're going to be God made
[56:26] manifest huh you you guys are crazy
[56:31] you're going to do the works Jesus said
[56:32] you're really crazy oh I'll lock these
[56:34] guys up
[56:36] but those to whom the word is given he
[56:39] takes them and he does something
[56:40] different with them than he can do with
[56:42] anybody else in the world and here it is
[56:44] right there in the word of God because
[56:46] this is how exactly
[56:50] our brother Branham taught
[56:53] you're perfect
[56:55] but you're not complete
[56:57] you're perfect but you got to lay in the
[56:59] presence of the sun you're perfect but
[57:01] you got to ripen all these things there
[57:05] they are perfect word okay
[57:08] so this brings to mind another scripture
[57:10] if he uh Ephesians chapter one again
[57:13] going to the weast
[57:15] ah it's so rich
[57:18] I want you to know in these two verses
[57:21] chapter one of Ephesians in the whis
[57:25] translation is the message of the hour
[57:28] in one verse
[57:31] the whole message is there
[57:33] here it is
[57:35] hidden before the eyes of the wise and
[57:38] proven prudent but revealed unto babes
[57:40] that we'll learn
[57:43] okay verse 9. according to the wealth of
[57:46] his grace which he caused to let's say
[57:48] were accepted in the Beloved okay
[57:51] and he caused a super abound not abound
[57:55] super abound to us in the sphere of
[57:57] wisdom every wisdom and understanding
[57:59] having made known to us the mystery of
[58:02] his will according that which seemed
[58:04] good to him
[58:06] which good thing he purposed in himself
[58:09] his purpose
[58:11] with respect to the administration of
[58:13] the completion of the epox of time
[58:15] that's us that's here that's now this is
[58:18] the time
[58:20] and what's he going to do in this time
[58:22] fulfill the message of the hour no not
[58:25] learn it
[58:27] not learn it become it
[58:30] you with me
[58:31] and here's what it is this is the
[58:33] message
[58:34] okay and the completion of the epochs of
[58:37] time to bring again to their original
[58:39] state all things in Christ can you
[58:42] believe that's in the Bible
[58:44] it's right there in Ephesians it's right
[58:46] there in the in the message and the
[58:48] whole message is right there isn't that
[58:50] the message Christ is the mystery of God
[58:51] revealed
[58:52] and all the rest of them isn't that what
[58:54] he's talking about here it is in the
[58:56] Bible
[58:57] don't you love it
[58:59] bring back to their original state okay
[59:01] I gotta keep moving so I'm gonna finish
[59:05] so Hebrews 10 14 and Ephesians is
[59:10] exactly what brother Branham preached
[59:13] he's a word Prophet preaches the Bible
[59:16] even if they can't see it it's the Bible
[59:18] and it's there and it's perfect
[59:22] so part one here is I want you to know
[59:26] that there's a work continuing on
[59:28] he hasn't left us he loves us amen
[59:31] you're perfect by the blood
[59:35] but you are not finished work by the
[59:37] spirit
[59:38] and that's very scriptural and can they
[59:42] be yes they can be and they are so
[59:45] a couple things that brother Brenham
[59:48] says and we're going to go
[59:51] yep there we go
[59:53] one thing he wants us to do again this
[59:57] is part one we're perfected by the blood
[1:00:00] but we're not a finished work
[1:00:03] so in the message God God's only
[1:00:05] provided place of worship Steve you were
[1:00:07] mentioning this yesterday okay I believe
[1:00:10] the church is beginning to hear the
[1:00:11] message this is 1965 August isn't it
[1:00:14] Jason yep
[1:00:17] so he knew
[1:00:18] brother Bradham was very aware of what
[1:00:20] the people were not hearing but because
[1:00:23] it wasn't time
[1:00:25] right
[1:00:26] but let me tell you it's time
[1:00:29] Now's the Time isn't it
[1:00:32] okay and begin to understand begin to
[1:00:35] understand but friends listen we got to
[1:00:37] there it is
[1:00:39] lay in the presence of well if I'm
[1:00:41] perfect why do I need to do that
[1:00:44] you're perfect but I'm not done working
[1:00:46] with you because I need to mature you to
[1:00:48] make you me
[1:00:50] okay
[1:00:52] we got to lay in the presence of the sun
[1:00:54] we've got to be ripened then once they
[1:00:57] say our faith
[1:00:59] isn't ripe is that the truth yeah
[1:01:02] intellectually
[1:01:04] we're hearing the message of God that
[1:01:06] God has given us and seen the signs that
[1:01:08] he showed us and proven it by the Bible
[1:01:11] is there oh how the church needs to lay
[1:01:14] in the presence tell it amen something
[1:01:17] happens
[1:01:19] yeah tenders up
[1:01:21] gets what
[1:01:23] where there you go so it can do what
[1:01:29] you know that's sort of interesting
[1:01:30] isn't it you got some cleaning up kids
[1:01:33] yeah but I can't clean up with that
[1:01:35] rotten
[1:01:37] Spirit right it fits right in doesn't it
[1:01:43] something's got to happen in my spirit
[1:01:46] something has to happen in my spirit so
[1:01:49] that I can bathe down
[1:01:50] okay
[1:01:52] so sometimes in the message you get
[1:01:55] harsh you have to break it
[1:01:57] in like that because you've got a
[1:01:59] cleansing nail to make it hold but when
[1:02:01] the church once gets it
[1:02:03] he's telling me something really big
[1:02:06] here when the church once get it gets it
[1:02:09] I think we're just starting to
[1:02:13] the elected is called out and separated
[1:02:15] then in the presence of God
[1:02:18] now listen something's going to happen
[1:02:21] when I get it really get it
[1:02:24] some there's a transforming power that
[1:02:27] happens in me that makes me look
[1:02:28] different and act different talk
[1:02:30] different walk different
[1:02:31] today
[1:02:32] amen and I'm going to be thinking like
[1:02:34] Jesus and talking like Jesus and doing
[1:02:36] the works of Jesus and the things of the
[1:02:40] world
[1:02:42] I'm oblivious to because I'm walking in
[1:02:44] a world with God Alone
[1:02:47] right isn't that what he says
[1:02:50] I know it'll be something like the
[1:02:53] people was there you are going to be
[1:02:56] already there's a thing happening that
[1:03:00] you're not going to be there and be
[1:03:02] changed like he tells us you're already
[1:03:04] going to be changed here like those that
[1:03:07] are already there
[1:03:09] so we all have to ask that question
[1:03:11] where am I with you
[1:03:13] am I playing Church
[1:03:17] oh I'm a Believer yeah that's good but
[1:03:20] that's just the beginning take another
[1:03:22] step
[1:03:23] he's making the transformation now from
[1:03:26] becoming Believers to becoming becomers
[1:03:28] you have to become the word manifest not
[1:03:31] just believe the word amen okay
[1:03:35] so here you're perfect but I'm still
[1:03:38] working with you
[1:03:40] and I don't know about you but I'm
[1:03:41] really glad
[1:03:45] and that's the best thing you got going
[1:03:47] for you right now is that the spirit
[1:03:49] hasn't left you because you go out there
[1:03:51] and look around you and talk to people
[1:03:55] go to your workplace go to the grocery
[1:03:56] store and start talking about what the
[1:03:59] word is doing and they'll look like you
[1:04:02] mm-hmm
[1:04:04] deer in the adelites
[1:04:07] right yeah
[1:04:09] but you say hey God's working in me and
[1:04:12] he's making me him he's doing what
[1:04:16] you are both
[1:04:18] get used to it that's okay okay
[1:04:22] now so that's one thing here's the next
[1:04:24] thing this is from the message perfect
[1:04:25] faith
[1:04:27] and he comes to the end of the message
[1:04:29] and he says watch a perfect God
[1:04:32] I'm don't go into the middle of it with
[1:04:34] the perfect heart keep a perfect Promise
[1:04:36] by his perfect word which is sharper
[1:04:38] than here it goes to Hebrews 4 12. isn't
[1:04:41] that interesting
[1:04:43] something in my perfection has something
[1:04:45] to do with Hebrews 4 12. isn't that
[1:04:47] interesting so it's not just I have a
[1:04:50] knowledge that there's three parts of me
[1:04:52] there's something that the holy spirit
[1:04:54] is doing in those three parts and has to
[1:04:56] do in those three parts that he did with
[1:04:57] the prophet because he's saying why are
[1:04:59] you expressing something that doesn't
[1:05:01] reflect your inner soul
[1:05:03] amen
[1:05:05] why are you acting like the world why
[1:05:07] are you acting somebody like everybody
[1:05:08] else that just reflects your human
[1:05:10] spirit
[1:05:13] you with me
[1:05:14] okay
[1:05:18] which is sharper than a two-edged sword
[1:05:20] and a discerner of the thoughts of the
[1:05:22] heart
[1:05:22] what we're coming down to that
[1:05:24] Perfection because the people who look
[1:05:26] at this has to come to that and over for
[1:05:28] the rapture
[1:05:30] so I'm not there yeah that's why we're
[1:05:32] here
[1:05:34] I have a question for you
[1:05:37] aren't you getting tired of being here
[1:05:40] wouldn't you like to get home yeah then
[1:05:43] he needs to do these things because
[1:05:45] these are the things he says need to be
[1:05:48] done right
[1:05:51] okay look at what he says
[1:05:54] that's
[1:05:56] read it out loud with me what's holding
[1:05:58] it away right now is waiting for the
[1:06:01] church to come into that perfect
[1:06:03] raptured Faith looking for it look at
[1:06:06] what it says
[1:06:07] it means a lot of Shaving down for a
[1:06:11] being it means a lot for you but
[1:06:13] together we'll make it by the grave
[1:06:16] all right
[1:06:18] who wants to be shaved
[1:06:25] Save Me Lord shave it up okay that's
[1:06:27] like Hebrews 12 he's going to shake
[1:06:29] everything off of it that isn't him yes
[1:06:32] yes no
[1:06:34] here's the problem we have heard too
[1:06:37] many things
[1:06:39] for too many years
[1:06:42] to not have it happen
[1:06:45] how many years have you heard these
[1:06:48] things
[1:06:49] how many decades some of us yeah
[1:06:53] so that's where the message that is the
[1:06:55] rising of the sun says there's a
[1:06:57] quickening power here
[1:06:59] now we need to tap into that because the
[1:07:01] things that we've heard for so long were
[1:07:03] just bumps on the log
[1:07:06] why haven't they taken effect
[1:07:10] why aren't we being changed
[1:07:13] because we're playing Church
[1:07:15] do you know that you are sitting in one
[1:07:18] of the most dangerous places that there
[1:07:21] is is the church
[1:07:23] and the one that can help you the most
[1:07:25] but is also the most dangerous because
[1:07:26] you can feel like I come here I do my
[1:07:29] duty oh it's Wednesday I go to church oh
[1:07:32] it's Sunday I go to church so what
[1:07:35] what do you do on Monday morning and
[1:07:37] Tuesday and where is the word debt and
[1:07:40] how many messages have you heard this
[1:07:41] week and why not
[1:07:43] because
[1:07:45] I'm interested in nothing listen let me
[1:07:47] tell you something very painful you do
[1:07:49] what you want to do
[1:07:50] you make time for what you want to make
[1:07:52] time for
[1:07:54] you well where's the word in that oh
[1:07:55] well by the time I have time for that
[1:07:58] I'm too tired and I fall asleep oh
[1:08:00] really
[1:08:01] do you understand me before God and say
[1:08:03] I just you're down on my list of things
[1:08:06] of importance to me
[1:08:10] God have mercy
[1:08:13] listen
[1:08:15] you can take these things as a threat
[1:08:20] Mino Hoffman's up here challenged us and
[1:08:22] telling how evil we are and how bad we
[1:08:25] are or you can take it as
[1:08:27] Oh you mean you want to do that in me
[1:08:29] too and I haven't let you you mean you
[1:08:32] love me that much that you're working
[1:08:33] with me you want to do these things with
[1:08:35] me huh
[1:08:37] that's up to you how you take it yes
[1:08:39] but I'm praying that through the
[1:08:41] hardness of the things I have to say
[1:08:43] this morning
[1:08:44] you would be encouraged
[1:08:47] because sometimes you give your kids a
[1:08:51] whooping because they need it
[1:08:54] right
[1:08:57] there's nothing like you know my wife
[1:08:58] used to say to my kids
[1:09:00] I love you too much to let you act that
[1:09:03] way
[1:09:06] and you know what else she would say I
[1:09:07] want other people to like you and if
[1:09:09] you're a brat nobody's going to want you
[1:09:11] around right
[1:09:13] is that true
[1:09:16] so we have a Divine parent don't we
[1:09:19] he says I'm not going to let you act
[1:09:21] that way I love you too much
[1:09:25] so thank you Lord he turns us over okay
[1:09:29] all right
[1:09:31] um
[1:09:33] from the message North or not this is
[1:09:35] 1965.
[1:09:37] August right before he's done at
[1:09:40] Jeffersonville forever
[1:09:43] okay and at the beginning of the message
[1:09:47] and at the end of the message he tells
[1:09:49] us why we're not
[1:09:51] gone yet okay
[1:09:54] let's think of the loudest in church age
[1:09:56] and it's condition day today as far as I
[1:09:59] know I don't see anything to hinder at
[1:10:01] this time the coming of the Lord Jesus
[1:10:02] outside of what
[1:10:05] okay go look in the mirror
[1:10:09] so I'm holding the upload
[1:10:13] true or not true
[1:10:16] all right then what do you want to do
[1:10:18] and what are you waiting to do and what
[1:10:20] am I not allowing you to do that's
[1:10:22] holding us all here
[1:10:25] 1965 right at the end of the message at
[1:10:28] the end of his life okay
[1:10:30] then at the end of the same message
[1:10:33] he says
[1:10:35] what are we coming here for
[1:10:38] your church what are you what are we
[1:10:40] doing
[1:10:40] are we coming playing the game
[1:10:43] are we coming here may meeting as a
[1:10:46] lodge
[1:10:48] I told you this is a dangerous place you
[1:10:52] can feel spiritually comfortable by here
[1:10:54] and being dead as a doornail in your
[1:10:56] soul
[1:10:59] okay that is a door nail
[1:11:02] something's got to be going on on the
[1:11:04] inside something's got to be churning
[1:11:07] something's got to be correcting every
[1:11:09] day
[1:11:10] that word wasn't for me that thought
[1:11:13] wasn't from me that action wasn't for me
[1:11:15] I'm sorry Lord I'm sorry I want you I
[1:11:19] want your thoughts right okay
[1:11:22] the church Christ can't come until that
[1:11:25] church is perfectly right
[1:11:27] he's waiting on
[1:11:31] us
[1:11:32] I believe we're at the end well this was
[1:11:35] 1965.
[1:11:38] so where are we
[1:11:40] from the message it is the rising of the
[1:11:43] sun okay
[1:11:46] notice it was a force he talks about the
[1:11:50] wave sheep offering that that's very
[1:11:53] rich because that
[1:11:55] what happened
[1:11:58] When It Was Elijah and Elisha
[1:12:02] okay
[1:12:03] so Elisha asks Elijah I want a double
[1:12:06] portion now Jason
[1:12:09] my theologian
[1:12:13] why did Elijah tell him yet of see him
[1:12:15] go what did that have to do with it
[1:12:24] Steve you got to see me go or you get
[1:12:25] nothing
[1:12:26] well that's sort of dumb
[1:12:30] if it's mine to have why can't I just
[1:12:32] have it why do I have to watch her go
[1:12:35] isn't that interesting
[1:12:37] brother Branham talks about it
[1:12:40] now it's very interesting when you saw
[1:12:42] him when he get a double portion
[1:12:45] okay now
[1:12:48] it's very very interesting in Acts
[1:12:51] chapter one
[1:12:52] Jesus was with the
[1:12:56] Saints there for about 40 days before he
[1:12:58] was taken up I think it says
[1:13:01] right and then he says they watched him
[1:13:04] go
[1:13:06] that interesting
[1:13:08] they saw him go and what happened
[1:13:11] brother Bradham says a double portion
[1:13:13] but the Holy Spirit came down yeah right
[1:13:15] yeah
[1:13:17] keep your eyes on him
[1:13:18] and you have to keep your eyes on him
[1:13:21] now there's this he says this happened
[1:13:24] in this day the spirit of the Lord waved
[1:13:27] over the people
[1:13:29] and he says here it is but this time
[1:13:32] it's a mature inward
[1:13:34] that's a maturing spirit
[1:13:39] all right is that what he said
[1:13:42] are you maturing
[1:13:49] it's Grace every day isn't it
[1:13:55] that's why they had to wave the sheep
[1:13:57] for it was the first one to come to
[1:13:59] maturity and it was waived as a memorial
[1:14:01] of Thanksgiving to God believing that
[1:14:03] the rest of them would come it was a
[1:14:04] sign yeah
[1:14:06] okay it was a sign so
[1:14:08] say it out loud Steve I'm coming to
[1:14:10] majority
[1:14:12] there you go
[1:14:14] not because of
[1:14:16] what you are but because of who you are
[1:14:19] that seed inside okay
[1:14:22] all of these quotes I'm telling you yes
[1:14:25] you're perfect no I'm not done with you
[1:14:28] yes I gotta work it doesn't take away
[1:14:31] your Perfection right
[1:14:35] but it's still saying I'm you're not
[1:14:37] mature you're not where I want you to be
[1:14:38] okay so that's why I'm doing all of
[1:14:41] these quotes
[1:14:43] um
[1:14:49] again I'm going back to the
[1:14:54] the message just to bring this in
[1:14:56] uh
[1:14:58] perfect faith
[1:15:00] we're perfect by a perfect word which is
[1:15:03] sharper than a two-edged sword
[1:15:05] and watch a perfect God
[1:15:08] with a perfect heart
[1:15:11] keep a perfect promise
[1:15:15] to his children who he perfected
[1:15:20] by a perfect word that is sharper than a
[1:15:22] two-edged sword and a discerner of the
[1:15:25] thoughts of the heart
[1:15:26] he's referring to Hebrews 4 12. now we
[1:15:29] go to part two
[1:15:33] where
[1:15:35] was it that our God worked in his
[1:15:37] prophet
[1:15:39] and why
[1:15:41] and where he must do the same work
[1:15:46] for me and you
[1:15:48] okay
[1:15:50] now I'm
[1:15:51] if you
[1:15:55] think of and you go home and study
[1:15:58] there's three messages that I would like
[1:16:00] to give you where all of these things
[1:16:02] are expounded on exponentially
[1:16:05] those three messages are March of 1962
[1:16:08] the greatest battle ever fought please
[1:16:10] remember that
[1:16:12] okay
[1:16:13] both both of the next two are in 1965
[1:16:19] in Jeffersonville his last
[1:16:22] month there before he goes and then
[1:16:25] never comes back
[1:16:27] next one is thinking mansfelder
[1:16:30] and the last one is north and not so
[1:16:32] remember those three
[1:16:34] three messages and please
[1:16:37] okay now I'm ready for sketch one
[1:16:40] Whoever has that okay
[1:16:46] the greatest battle this is so common
[1:16:48] okay we all know this is kindergarten
[1:16:51] stuff Body Soul and Spirit we know the
[1:16:53] scripture talks about this what have you
[1:16:55] done with it
[1:16:57] what have you done with your knowledge
[1:16:58] of that well I know that I'm Body Soul
[1:17:01] Spirit okay
[1:17:05] then go to sketch two
[1:17:07] here here's the thing that brother
[1:17:09] Bradham starts in the message greatest
[1:17:11] battle ever fought and he tells you
[1:17:14] where does that battle take place
[1:17:16] everybody knows that right where's the
[1:17:19] greatest battle ever here okay
[1:17:22] now in that message brother Branham
[1:17:25] refers to this and he talks about our
[1:17:28] own solar system isn't that interesting
[1:17:30] okay and he says see all those channels
[1:17:36] okay now he he names of course
[1:17:40] the Realms of the flesh see Phil see
[1:17:43] feels smell taste here
[1:17:46] to contact this world you need it you
[1:17:49] live in it you have to contact this
[1:17:50] world okay but you have a human spirit
[1:17:53] and that human spirit that conglomerate
[1:17:56] right there is what the world would say
[1:17:59] that's your mind
[1:18:01] and brother Brandon breaks up that parts
[1:18:03] of your mind and he says okay you have
[1:18:06] conscience imagination reasoning
[1:18:09] affection and Imagination
[1:18:12] he says do you know what happened to
[1:18:13] those uh you should have been here for
[1:18:15] Sunday School
[1:18:16] okay hybrid
[1:18:19] Satan has plugged up every one of those
[1:18:21] channels he says there are flus that
[1:18:23] have been stopped up
[1:18:25] so as long as my reasoningness
[1:18:28] is plugged up by Satan then God can't
[1:18:33] throw he really has a hard time getting
[1:18:35] through my reasoning true or wrong true
[1:18:38] what about my conscience what about my
[1:18:40] imagination huh teenagers
[1:18:44] you got imaginations that are going wild
[1:18:47] right oh how about this teenagers what
[1:18:49] about your affections
[1:18:51] because your affections are so plugged
[1:18:54] up by the devil
[1:18:56] that he makes something attractive and
[1:18:59] dangles it out from you and we just
[1:19:02] right
[1:19:04] because Satan is using that affection
[1:19:07] and not God Amen
[1:19:09] and you know what that leads to
[1:19:11] pain
[1:19:13] I'm sure always correct okay so that
[1:19:18] that's what I wanted to get he said no
[1:19:22] what's the matter I'm going to just read
[1:19:24] the last part of the quote from the
[1:19:25] greatest battle ever fought that refers
[1:19:27] to this well that's the way matter with
[1:19:30] so many blowed up Christians he talks
[1:19:33] about those channels as a flu
[1:19:35] in a boiler and it's all plugged up so
[1:19:38] the boiler just
[1:19:40] explodes
[1:19:41] that's some what's the matter with so
[1:19:43] many excuse me blowed up Christians is
[1:19:45] because they don't clean the channels
[1:19:47] out
[1:19:48] they don't go down it does they don't go
[1:19:50] down to the inside you've got to clean
[1:19:53] it
[1:19:54] you've got to clean it your conscience
[1:19:57] your memory your thoughts laying aside
[1:20:01] everything and coming from the inside
[1:20:02] out
[1:20:03] we see an unadulterated word of God so
[1:20:06] the what is he telling you he said I
[1:20:08] have no place in my reasoning
[1:20:11] for the word once plugged up but what's
[1:20:15] God's he says I only want my word in
[1:20:18] your reasoning yeah I only want my word
[1:20:21] in your conscience
[1:20:24] I only want my word in your imagination
[1:20:27] I only want my word in your
[1:20:31] affections
[1:20:34] you say I can't do that what does he say
[1:20:36] to you I know it
[1:20:38] it's about time you do it too right
[1:20:41] you can't do it I never asked you come
[1:20:43] on did he ever ask you to
[1:20:46] let me do it yeah
[1:20:49] yeah let me let my love come in and do
[1:20:51] what you could never do right okay
[1:20:54] next sketch is what he says in the
[1:20:58] message
[1:21:00] um thinking Mansfield or 1965 and he's
[1:21:03] talking about the denominational person
[1:21:06] the religious person
[1:21:09] and he says everything that they
[1:21:11] processes from the outside in
[1:21:13] so they
[1:21:15] their likes
[1:21:18] and then they go from their likes to
[1:21:20] their reason
[1:21:22] and their conscience and then then
[1:21:24] they'll take that word and say well that
[1:21:27] doesn't fit with my reasoning I I think
[1:21:30] and so it can't go down to their soul
[1:21:32] it's stuck there yeah
[1:21:34] do you understand that how much of our
[1:21:36] life have we processing through your
[1:21:39] reasoning and conscience and Imagination
[1:21:41] and affection Right
[1:21:44] and he said you know what you will never
[1:21:46] go in the Rapture that way
[1:21:50] so we cannot be
[1:21:54] like those people he's talking about in
[1:21:57] thinking man's filter and process things
[1:22:00] from the outside in
[1:22:01] those channels have to be cleaned and
[1:22:04] it's got to be turned around now
[1:22:08] okay
[1:22:10] um
[1:22:11] from the message thinking man's filter
[1:22:13] the soul is drawing your resource
[1:22:15] resource through the outside down
[1:22:18] through the spirit into the soul wrong
[1:22:20] direction
[1:22:21] and then the Soul listen what he says
[1:22:24] the soul that loves the world that's
[1:22:26] dead
[1:22:28] yeah
[1:22:30] I don't care how how it's anointed
[1:22:33] okay it's out here and it's how
[1:22:36] righteous it is out here down here it's
[1:22:39] dead
[1:22:41] ouch
[1:22:43] but thank you Father I needed that
[1:22:44] spanking okay
[1:22:47] so keep working with me Lord
[1:22:50] it's the only hope you got it's the only
[1:22:52] hope I got yeah that is working with us
[1:22:55] in this day sketch number four
[1:22:59] there we go you notice I I'm taking this
[1:23:03] this three circles and I'm putting the
[1:23:08] outside Circle up on top why
[1:23:11] hold your babies
[1:23:13] right that's the only thing that they
[1:23:16] have to deal with
[1:23:17] is see
[1:23:18] taste feel smell in here right so as a
[1:23:22] as our age
[1:23:24] as we get older like to the age of
[1:23:26] accountability
[1:23:28] then below that
[1:23:31] is the second but
[1:23:36] that's why we have to be so careful
[1:23:37] brothers and sisters
[1:23:39] a little tiny child is Led
[1:23:43] wow I'm hungry wow I'm dirty
[1:23:46] right what I'm what I want to taste what
[1:23:50] I want to feel
[1:23:52] governs their whole being correct right
[1:23:55] and I can look at people out in the
[1:23:56] world that are still living that way
[1:23:58] true or not true
[1:24:01] age of accountability you all of a
[1:24:04] sudden the reasoning starts to take
[1:24:07] effect but it's plugged by Satan
[1:24:09] right yeah conscience imagination
[1:24:12] affection all of those but they're a
[1:24:15] mess okay and then way down inside is a
[1:24:19] soul
[1:24:20] okay
[1:24:22] here's the thing
[1:24:26] all of our
[1:24:29] message life all of us have heard
[1:24:32] brother Branham say that
[1:24:35] rapturing faith lies in the tapes right
[1:24:39] I'm not kidding you know I I'm old I'm
[1:24:42] 75 almost 76.
[1:24:46] I'm so thick-headed but he's still
[1:24:48] working on me and I'm telling you
[1:24:50] brothers and sisters if he can get to me
[1:24:52] he can get to any of you you know
[1:24:57] so I heard that because I believed it
[1:25:00] because he said it
[1:25:02] but just this last year and a half or
[1:25:04] two I'm experiencing it and I'm seeing
[1:25:06] things you know we would never know the
[1:25:09] things we know without the spirit of the
[1:25:11] Lord coming to this age to fulfill his
[1:25:13] scripture I have to get these things to
[1:25:16] my kids because it's going to help them
[1:25:19] I have to get these things to the kids
[1:25:22] to show them how much I love them
[1:25:25] I have to get these things to the kids
[1:25:27] to say I'm going to tell you who the
[1:25:30] real you is because you were deceived by
[1:25:32] Satan thinking the real you as something
[1:25:34] rotten
[1:25:36] think about that
[1:25:38] okay so here
[1:25:43] is
[1:25:44] Hebrews 4 12.
[1:25:47] where God came in this day and decided
[1:25:50] his it's time for you to know I'm going
[1:25:53] to divide your soul in spirit
[1:25:56] okay and it's not just standing
[1:25:58] as the prophet did so beautifully by the
[1:26:01] spirit of God in the discernment
[1:26:03] Discerning the thought that no listen to
[1:26:06] these things
[1:26:08] the love of God
[1:26:10] revealing not only his true identity to
[1:26:14] you
[1:26:15] but yours
[1:26:17] also your true identity
[1:26:20] he has blessed us and has equipped us to
[1:26:24] become him manifested same as he did his
[1:26:26] prophet
[1:26:28] he hears the real you
[1:26:31] here's the true you what our God is
[1:26:34] revealing to us about us
[1:26:38] that's love
[1:26:41] okay now this is from
[1:26:46] thinking man's filter again
[1:26:48] the love of God okay he says notice the
[1:26:50] word cannot deny itself
[1:26:53] then it's satisfied or its desire it's a
[1:26:56] desire of what what made you desire in
[1:26:59] the first place
[1:27:00] because down in your soul there was a
[1:27:03] predestinated seed that was eternal life
[1:27:06] always laying there always in there all
[1:27:09] that the father has given me will come
[1:27:10] to me there isn't any of them going to
[1:27:12] be lost don't you love that
[1:27:16] what did you have to do with that inside
[1:27:18] of the inside that was that could only
[1:27:20] do one or two things
[1:27:23] there you go
[1:27:25] it says yes or no I'm going to ask each
[1:27:27] one of your question
[1:27:29] you've had trouble you've had things in
[1:27:31] your life and you think I'm going insane
[1:27:33] it's because of this battle going on
[1:27:35] between your soul and your spirit
[1:27:38] okay and you have always been convinced
[1:27:41] by the devil that what you think
[1:27:44] and what is going on in that realm
[1:27:47] that's the real you
[1:27:49] ask you a question down deep inside
[1:27:52] whenever you've heard the word of God
[1:27:55] did you ever say no to it
[1:27:58] because you couldn't
[1:28:01] because that's the real you
[1:28:05] that other isn't the real you
[1:28:07] know and here's what the brother brought
[1:28:09] him so beautifully is trying to tell us
[1:28:11] I want you to know who the real you is
[1:28:14] okay
[1:28:18] now
[1:28:23] where am I okay yeah
[1:28:27] here's another one if that Soul hasn't
[1:28:29] come from God it can make all the
[1:28:30] impersonations but it cannot be real
[1:28:34] okay you can act healing you can act
[1:28:38] like you have and be ever so good at it
[1:28:40] but that don't mean you're saved that's
[1:28:42] exactly right the spirit can be real
[1:28:44] genuine Holy Spirit can anoint you
[1:28:47] doesn't mean you're saved it's that
[1:28:49] inside Soul That Never Dies it's got
[1:28:51] eternal life it always was eternal life
[1:28:53] it come from God and it goes to God you
[1:28:56] came from God
[1:28:57] in your soul and you go back so you have
[1:29:00] part of you that's eternal
[1:29:03] awesome
[1:29:05] now if that's the case why am I going
[1:29:09] crazy because of what's going bouncing
[1:29:12] around in my head
[1:29:14] do you remember the old-fashioned
[1:29:15] pinball machines
[1:29:18] you ever feel that way yeah go get on
[1:29:21] your knees to pray and all of a sudden
[1:29:25] bound and there's no right it just goes
[1:29:27] everywhere
[1:29:29] and you think well Lord I'm sorry
[1:29:33] you think well then the devil's right
[1:29:34] there on your shoulder how do you think
[1:29:36] you can be a son of hard
[1:29:42] because the Son of God would never think
[1:29:44] those things
[1:29:46] isn't he good yeah
[1:29:49] God's better
[1:29:51] so God come along and you know what he
[1:29:52] said you know let me tell you about her
[1:29:56] that's not you
[1:29:58] I'm going to give you the true
[1:29:59] identification the real you came from me
[1:30:01] and the real you is a part of me and the
[1:30:04] real you has never done anything your
[1:30:06] whole life but say Amen to this word
[1:30:10] isn't that wonderful yeah isn't that a
[1:30:13] gift
[1:30:14] no wonder he says rapturing faith lies
[1:30:17] in these tapes huh
[1:30:19] without these Revelations of these last
[1:30:21] day we wouldn't have Rapture in faith
[1:30:23] but it's given to us oh I used to have a
[1:30:26] sister a dear friend of ours from New
[1:30:29] Mexico her name was Verdi Smith you've
[1:30:32] ever heard somebody by the name of
[1:30:33] Birdie oh she was special
[1:30:35] do you know what she used to tell me
[1:30:36] Hoffman get your head down in that word
[1:30:38] and don't come up for error
[1:30:42] and she meant it
[1:30:44] often don't
[1:30:46] get your head down in that word and
[1:30:47] don't come up for air yes sister
[1:30:51] she knew I needed it and I did at the
[1:30:53] time
[1:30:54] yeah
[1:30:56] okay
[1:30:58] so that what brother Branham said is
[1:31:00] absolutely scriptural John 5 24
[1:31:03] truly truly I say unto you whosoever
[1:31:06] hears my word and believes him who sent
[1:31:08] me has eternal life
[1:31:10] now we'll get it now we'll die and go to
[1:31:13] heaven and live eternally no you have
[1:31:15] eternal life and because you have this
[1:31:19] eternal life in you you believe the word
[1:31:20] of God
[1:31:22] right
[1:31:23] who's the real you
[1:31:26] is the real you your spirit no
[1:31:29] okay what about the outside parts now
[1:31:31] here's the main thing we're going to the
[1:31:33] next one that's a from the message North
[1:31:35] and not
[1:31:37] now this outside man is the flesh
[1:31:39] brother branham's doing the three
[1:31:40] circles Body Soul and Spirit okay
[1:31:43] and the outside man is the flesh that's
[1:31:45] what we look at that's what we see five
[1:31:48] inlets to that body any grammar school
[1:31:50] child and myself would know that there's
[1:31:52] five senses to control the body
[1:31:54] skip that's the only way you can have a
[1:31:57] body see taste feel smells here now what
[1:32:00] does he say that is the what
[1:32:03] unaware
[1:32:05] so you're sort of a mess not really God
[1:32:08] designed it that way
[1:32:10] okay
[1:32:11] so that's the evil one now on the side
[1:32:13] of that go on
[1:32:15] there we go this is the important one
[1:32:20] I know you've read this but I want this
[1:32:22] to sink into you today
[1:32:24] now the inside is that Spirit which you
[1:32:28] become when you're born of the earth and
[1:32:29] the Breath of Life breathed into him
[1:32:32] that spirit is of a what
[1:32:38] you were born with it
[1:32:40] listen because it was look at this not
[1:32:44] given from God
[1:32:47] but was permitted by God
[1:32:51] so you have a spirit that was never part
[1:32:54] of God it's of a worldly nature but he
[1:32:57] said I'm going to permit that to go in
[1:32:58] you
[1:32:59] well that's sort of Me no come on you
[1:33:02] God God is love
[1:33:04] and he's doing everything perfectly and
[1:33:06] he's going to work it out but he's going
[1:33:07] to say do you know what the most freeing
[1:33:09] thing for me in this day is
[1:33:12] is for the Holy Spirit to say look at
[1:33:14] your conscious look at what's going on
[1:33:16] in your imagination look what's going on
[1:33:18] in your reason oh Lord they drive me
[1:33:20] crazy
[1:33:22] and what does the Holy Spirit saying in
[1:33:24] this day
[1:33:28] that isn't
[1:33:31] isn't it the real you is the soul that
[1:33:33] came from me the real Soul the real you
[1:33:36] is the soul from that's part of me the
[1:33:38] real you
[1:33:40] is the thing that always says amen
[1:33:44] don't you love that identification
[1:33:47] so your spirit is not really that's not
[1:33:50] part of God he just permitted it
[1:33:52] okay
[1:33:54] it's what drives me nuts
[1:33:57] don't identify with the brothers and
[1:34:00] sisters
[1:34:01] identify with what the brother brought
[1:34:04] him says the real you y-o-u soul
[1:34:07] that came from God it's a part of God it
[1:34:11] came from him and it's going back to him
[1:34:12] right the thing that says amen that's
[1:34:15] the real you yeah
[1:34:17] what a gift for the Bride of Jesus
[1:34:19] Christ tell me that doesn't make a
[1:34:21] difference because you need that to know
[1:34:24] I can have rapturing faith
[1:34:27] now you know your true identity my
[1:34:30] identity is his word my identity is his
[1:34:34] Spirit my identity is him made manifest
[1:34:37] that's me I can't get away from it
[1:34:40] oh I got this part that drives me crazy
[1:34:42] yeah that's not you
[1:34:46] but
[1:34:47] you don't have an excuse to let that
[1:34:49] control you because the scripture says
[1:34:51] sin shall not have dominion over me
[1:34:54] okay
[1:34:55] so here's the question
[1:34:58] who or what is the real you notice how
[1:35:01] the prophet phrased that
[1:35:03] that person inside there
[1:35:06] okay
[1:35:08] going back to that quote
[1:35:10] look at
[1:35:12] it
[1:35:14] let me read it again the spirit is of a
[1:35:17] worldly nature because it's not given
[1:35:19] from God but it was given and permitted
[1:35:21] by God
[1:35:22] now you got that every child that's born
[1:35:25] in the world is born in sin shaped in
[1:35:26] iniquity come to the world speaking lies
[1:35:29] that right so look at that that person
[1:35:32] inside there is a sinner to begin with
[1:35:37] that person inside there that soul
[1:35:40] okay that's not the real you yeah the
[1:35:43] real you okay the soul inside that is
[1:35:47] the real you
[1:35:48] so God had to bring deliverance from
[1:35:51] that rule of the false identification
[1:35:53] that gained control and bondage over you
[1:35:57] saying that's that's me because I think
[1:36:00] those things Satan is there the Son of
[1:36:03] God wouldn't think that way
[1:36:05] and what happened to your faith when you
[1:36:07] received that thought
[1:36:11] well I can't have Rapture in faith well
[1:36:12] I'm just stuck here I'm a mess okay
[1:36:16] that's why this is critically important
[1:36:19] what brother what God did with brother
[1:36:20] Branham so
[1:36:22] to deliver
[1:36:25] the prophet
[1:36:26] Hebrews 4 12.
[1:36:30] had to become flesh and blood
[1:36:35] for the word of God is quick and
[1:36:37] Powerful
[1:36:39] sharper than any two-edged sword
[1:36:41] piercing
[1:36:43] even to the dividing asunder of the Soul
[1:36:46] and Spirit and the joints in the mirror
[1:36:47] and as the discerner of the thoughts and
[1:36:49] intents of the heart
[1:36:52] I want you to listen now
[1:36:54] this is hard
[1:36:56] but man is it good
[1:36:59] from the message North and not I want
[1:37:03] you to listen to our Prophet tell us how
[1:37:05] God had to separate his soul from his
[1:37:08] spirit
[1:37:10] so what he's trying to do with us this
[1:37:12] morning
[1:37:14] from the rule of his own spirit
[1:37:18] I want you to look how it was piercing
[1:37:22] and cutting
[1:37:23] and dividing even to the joints in the
[1:37:26] marrow from the outsard look at the
[1:37:29] where's the life nurses
[1:37:31] Merrell what do they why do they give
[1:37:33] marrow transplants
[1:37:35] huh this is a life in the bone structure
[1:37:38] or in the marrow
[1:37:40] in the marrow right
[1:37:44] from the outside framework has to be
[1:37:46] separated from the life of the framework
[1:37:51] he's in the hospital telling this story
[1:37:53] he just left the room where his wife
[1:37:55] died
[1:37:58] is going to the room
[1:38:00] whereas babies dying
[1:38:04] he says I sat there and I thought oh god
[1:38:06] what have I done
[1:38:09] you're a good God
[1:38:11] why did you let her die the other day me
[1:38:14] holding her two little arms like that
[1:38:16] begging him for her and why'd you let
[1:38:19] her go
[1:38:20] there's Billy lying there dying and she
[1:38:23] was dying what have I done tell me
[1:38:26] well I made well
[1:38:27] just go with him he wanted to die also I
[1:38:30] opened the door and no nurse was there I
[1:38:32] slipped down into the basement that was
[1:38:34] before the hospital was fixed
[1:38:36] screens no screens no windows hardly and
[1:38:38] then he flies flies on her eyes
[1:38:41] had a piece of mosquito bar we call it
[1:38:46] netting put over her face
[1:38:49] I shoot the Flies off laid their little
[1:38:51] eyes suffered so much till they were
[1:38:53] crossing
[1:38:54] then Satan moved by the side of me
[1:38:58] and said did you say he was a good God
[1:39:02] reasoning
[1:39:04] human spirit
[1:39:07] I said yeah I said that did you say he
[1:39:11] was a Healer
[1:39:12] Consciousness reason imagination well
[1:39:16] why did your father Die In Your Arms
[1:39:18] over there and you calling him a sinner
[1:39:20] calling for his life why did your
[1:39:22] brother die in your other brother's arms
[1:39:24] out there and you standing in the Pulpit
[1:39:26] preaching a few weeks ago why did he why
[1:39:29] didn't he answer you
[1:39:30] you said he loved you you said he saved
[1:39:33] you he couldn't tell me there was no God
[1:39:35] because I already seen him but he was
[1:39:37] telling me he didn't care for me oh yeah
[1:39:39] isn't he good at that
[1:39:43] listen I've been plagued with that my
[1:39:45] whole life

[1:40:24] bun me around and has held me captive
[1:40:26] for two years
[1:40:29] I know of no other place in the message
[1:40:32] where our Prophet tells us
[1:40:34] why you had to go through what he went
[1:40:37] through
[1:40:39] why God in 1937 says I'm not going to
[1:40:43] let you continue in your ministry
[1:40:46] until something changes
[1:40:51] and he puts something from the Lord as
[1:40:54] heartbreaking
[1:40:55] think of it piercing
[1:40:58] dividing
[1:41:00] cutting
[1:41:05] paragraph 199 read it out loud with me
[1:41:08] would you what did it do from it was
[1:41:12] working from the outside now
[1:41:15] there it is
[1:41:19] do you know that's what he has to do
[1:41:21] with every one of us
[1:41:24] he would not allow
[1:41:28] his Prophet to continue as long as he
[1:41:31] could be influenced by his own reasoning
[1:41:34] and his own Consciousness and his own
[1:41:36] imagination because listen to me God
[1:41:39] cannot be preeminent
[1:41:42] until he's preeminent in my conscience
[1:41:44] and he's preeminent in my thinking and
[1:41:47] my thinking is it's his thinking and my
[1:41:49] reasoning to see his reasoning and his
[1:41:51] word is a ruling not me
[1:41:53] and if the prophet would not allow him
[1:41:57] to go and continue in that Ministry and
[1:41:59] tell no that's got to be cleaned out
[1:42:03] what about me what about you what about
[1:42:06] us where we're at right today
[1:42:08] yeah and what stands before you in the
[1:42:10] Rapture is this is one of them
[1:42:13] why the church isn't ready this is one
[1:42:15] of them
[1:42:16] because you've identified yourself with
[1:42:18] the wrong thing number one
[1:42:20] oh the things that are going on your
[1:42:22] brain oh that's the real me no it isn't
[1:42:25] it yeah the real you is your soul the
[1:42:28] real you is the thing that says Amen to
[1:42:30] me
[1:42:31] but you believe that was the real you
[1:42:33] and so he comes today and he says you
[1:42:36] know that thing that Spirit your mind
[1:42:38] you know your reason your imagination
[1:42:40] that wasn't you
[1:42:42] that isn't even from God he just
[1:42:43] permitted it there
[1:42:46] but brother Branham used his own logic
[1:42:48] and he used his own reasons the
[1:42:50] Mother-in-law you know
[1:42:53] you're not going to take my daughter to
[1:42:55] those people oh yeah well maybe you're
[1:42:59] right maybe
[1:43:02] do you understand that what that costume
[1:43:04] yeah
[1:43:05] do you know the heartache that that
[1:43:07] brought him
[1:43:08] let me ask you something when God did
[1:43:11] this and him do you know what kind of a
[1:43:13] man he got
[1:43:19] and when he does this to me and to you
[1:43:22] do you know what a bride you'll have
[1:43:25] you'll have a bride that reflects him
[1:43:29] oh lose your identification of your
[1:43:33] spirit and gain the identification of
[1:43:36] your soul
[1:43:41] the part that came from God that goes
[1:43:44] back to God
[1:43:46] but brothers and sisters
[1:43:48] I want you to think about something
[1:43:52] that's the most amazing statement where
[1:43:55] the Prophet could say that what did that
[1:43:57] do all my heartache
[1:43:59] ah come on yeah you lose your wife you
[1:44:03] lose your baby you lose your brother you
[1:44:05] lose your dad all at the same time
[1:44:08] what did it do it was working from I was
[1:44:11] controlled by this outside
[1:44:16] no more
[1:44:19] you still didn't learn perfectly because
[1:44:21] he's human
[1:44:22] that was in 1937 wasn't it
[1:44:29] we are still
[1:44:31] governed Jason aren't we by Logic
[1:44:35] and reason
[1:44:36] 1953 he's in Africa
[1:44:39] South Africa
[1:44:41] and that's the meetings that uh all
[1:44:44] these different ministers arranged for
[1:44:47] him now
[1:44:49] brother Branham spoke to him in dreamers
[1:44:51] there he says I want you to quit I want
[1:44:53] you to go hunting for two weeks
[1:44:56] with Sydney Jackson isn't that right and
[1:44:59] then you'll come back and you'll have
[1:45:00] meetings like
[1:45:01] Beyond imagination
[1:45:05] now Jason you're an organizer
[1:45:10] and the prophet just called you and said
[1:45:12] Jason I'm coming to the United States
[1:45:14] and we're gonna you're gonna take me on
[1:45:16] tour around the Eastern United States so
[1:45:19] you were arranged so if you were
[1:45:21] arranging for the prophet you would say
[1:45:23] okay I need to put I need to call and
[1:45:27] make arrangements with this facility and
[1:45:29] this stadium and this Arena and this
[1:45:32] Racetrack and whatever and okay Jason
[1:45:35] we'll do that what date would you like
[1:45:36] it on I'd like it on such and such a
[1:45:38] date okay the deposit will be
[1:45:41] okay
[1:45:42] and so all those brother Branham told
[1:45:45] all of those ministers the holy spirit
[1:45:49] said
[1:45:50] no I want you to go hunting for two
[1:45:52] weeks yeah
[1:45:54] tell me that wouldn't break your brain
[1:45:57] for real right
[1:45:59] tell me that wouldn't drive you crazy
[1:46:02] how much money did you just put down on
[1:46:04] all those places
[1:46:07] now here's a question
[1:46:11] that's totally unreasonable
[1:46:13] is it
[1:46:16] is the holy spirit here to be reasonable
[1:46:22] that's totally illogical
[1:46:24] is the holy spirit here to be logical
[1:46:27] he might tell you something totally
[1:46:29] unreasonable totally illogical and
[1:46:33] he's expecting you to do it then finally
[1:46:35] brother Bradham says I you know look at
[1:46:37] what these guys have done
[1:46:38] how I'm going to mess up
[1:46:44] they'll never want me back ever
[1:46:47] logic logic reason reason right
[1:46:51] he says go ahead listen to him
[1:46:55] they just suffer for it
[1:46:58] what happened when he got
[1:47:00] he got the amiibo look at the dates
[1:47:05] I think it's about
[1:47:06] six months at least from October to
[1:47:09] March spring
[1:47:10] he's so sick he thinks he's dying
[1:47:13] this is when he went to the Mayo Clinic
[1:47:15] okay
[1:47:16] and they said sorry
[1:47:19] nothing we can do
[1:47:22] and he said okay I'm dying
[1:47:28] and he learned
[1:47:29] he even told me he says get the kids
[1:47:32] ready you're going to be on your own all
[1:47:34] right he thought he was dying yeah
[1:47:39] finally One Night in a vision I think
[1:47:42] the Lord appeared on the wall some fruit
[1:47:45] was it or something apples or
[1:47:47] and he knew he was healed I guarantee
[1:47:50] you
[1:47:52] after that
[1:47:54] you would never listen to this again
[1:47:58] 1953
[1:48:00] watch his life after that
[1:48:03] okay
[1:48:05] that he had to be separated from the
[1:48:08] rule of the human spirit
[1:48:12] and until God separates us from the rule
[1:48:16] of our human Spirit he cannot have the
[1:48:18] real preeminence
[1:48:21] stop and think about that amen is this
[1:48:23] my thinking I'm not preeminent sorry
[1:48:26] yeah
[1:48:28] stop and think about this brothers and
[1:48:29] sisters
[1:48:35] hard to understand
[1:48:37] but man
[1:48:40] what God got in that man yeah what a
[1:48:43] character yes Jesus Christ Ministry
[1:48:47] again repeated in the end times so for
[1:48:49] be and for you and to give us these
[1:48:53] things that are a reality and your give
[1:48:56] us our true identification
[1:48:59] that you can be free once and from all
[1:49:02] from Satan you telling you and pointing
[1:49:04] to the things that you're thinking when
[1:49:06] it's really him
[1:49:08] hey there's there's a
[1:49:10] place in COD Volume 2 where somebody
[1:49:13] asked brother Branham the question
[1:49:16] and says
[1:49:17] um how do I know if it's Satan's
[1:49:19] thinking or if it's me thinking
[1:49:22] do you remember reading that do you know
[1:49:24] what brother Branham says if it's a word
[1:49:26] it's God yeah
[1:49:28] and if it's not the word of Satan do you
[1:49:29] know what he just told you
[1:49:32] you don't even have anything
[1:49:35] yeah
[1:49:37] because we're all influenced by other
[1:49:40] dimensions we know that okay
[1:49:45] so you asked the question
[1:49:47] was this really the love of God
[1:49:49] to break a man's heart
[1:49:53] yes
[1:49:56] in the mind of the in the realm of the
[1:49:59] human Spirit you will never figure that
[1:50:01] out it may be logical
[1:50:03] okay but in your soul
[1:50:07] something makes sense
[1:50:10] right Jay
[1:50:16] it is eternal love
[1:50:19] that only that which comes from eternity
[1:50:22] can grasp
[1:50:26] stop and think about that
[1:50:32] so what about me and you brothers and
[1:50:34] sisters
[1:50:35] what about all the trials and heartaches
[1:50:38] you've gone through
[1:50:41] maybe they'll make sense to you maybe
[1:50:43] you'll understand I is moving he's
[1:50:46] trying to move me to the Inside Man
[1:50:50] that the soul would finally take its
[1:50:52] place of preeminence so God could be
[1:50:55] preeminent in my life
[1:51:02] he allows us to go through those things
[1:51:03] for a purpose
[1:51:06] is he not working the same things out in
[1:51:08] me and you is he not transforming us
[1:51:10] from men and women who would just
[1:51:12] believe to be men and women who are
[1:51:14] flesh of his flesh and bone of his bones
[1:51:16] life of his life power of his powers
[1:51:19] that my brother Bradham
[1:51:23] did he not become us that we might
[1:51:25] become him
[1:51:26] His Image his likeness that we have to
[1:51:29] have his mind yeah
[1:51:32] there's another whole sermon
[1:51:38] I want you to think about something as I
[1:51:40] close here
[1:51:41] and this is the grace and mercy of God
[1:51:45] Romans chapter 4 talks about Abraham who
[1:51:48] staggered not at the promises of God
[1:51:50] through faith but with strong giving
[1:51:52] praise to God
[1:51:56] brother Bradham tells us that Romans was
[1:51:59] the account that God saw
[1:52:02] and that's what God saw
[1:52:05] why didn't God see
[1:52:09] or hear
[1:52:11] oh that Ishmael might live before you
[1:52:16] finally dawned on me after
[1:52:19] this
[1:52:22] because that wasn't the real Abraham
[1:52:27] think about that Jake
[1:52:30] that was just a spirit that didn't come
[1:52:33] from me the real Abraham was his soul
[1:52:36] that said amen to everyone
[1:52:40] that beautiful
[1:52:43] God bless you brothers and sisters
[1:52:45] God be with you build you edify you
[1:52:49] every day we're here we're here for a
[1:52:51] reason but I'm telling you if we're
[1:52:54] holding them up
[1:52:56] let's quit holding him up let's get out
[1:53:00] of here I want to go home really bad
[1:53:03] don't you
[1:53:05] if he's waiting on the church then the
[1:53:08] church ought to be moving
[1:53:10] into those realms
[1:53:12] where eternity is in control amen love
[1:53:15] you all God bless you
[1:53:24] praise the Lord
[1:53:29] brother Tony he's taking us from
[1:53:32] walking by sight to walking by faith
[1:53:35] brother Caleb sister Joy
[1:53:38] walking by faith right our circumstances
[1:53:41] sometimes we have things presented in
[1:53:43] front of us let's let's stand
[1:53:46] we have things presented in front of us
[1:53:48] and trials and tribulations and God is
[1:53:51] saying I'm taking you from
[1:53:53] this realm
[1:53:55] to another realm from a realm of sight
[1:53:57] to a realm of faith and that faith has
[1:54:00] to be become our sight right
[1:54:02] you don't see you don't see a sickness
[1:54:06] you don't see a damaged person you don't
[1:54:09] see uh what is maybe in front of you or
[1:54:13] the possibilities but you see with God's
[1:54:16] promise
[1:54:17] and the reality is we're not just
[1:54:19] becoming Believers of that promises
[1:54:21] Brother Don was speaking about us but
[1:54:23] we're becoming that promise
[1:54:25] that promise is becoming a part of us
[1:54:28] and we're becoming a part of that and
[1:54:30] we're an expression of it and so
[1:54:31] regardless of the circumstances you fit
[1:54:34] you face there's a promise of God for
[1:54:36] you
[1:54:38] and you you know you can look at that
[1:54:39] and you could say but I had this
[1:54:42] terrible thing happen or I did this
[1:54:44] terrible thing
[1:54:46] that's not the real you it's there's a
[1:54:48] as brother Brandon said down inside of
[1:54:51] there there was another William Branham
[1:54:53] and he says that was the real
[1:54:56] William Branham right inside of you
[1:54:58] there's a real
[1:55:00] brother Jack Amen and that real brother
[1:55:03] Jack is growing and growing and
[1:55:06] permeating
[1:55:08] your entire being until that
[1:55:10] hey we're being made ready for a Rapture
[1:55:13] right
[1:55:14] at that time
[1:55:16] Body Soul and Spirit it's all perfectly
[1:55:19] of what God had in his mind before the
[1:55:22] foundation of the world
[1:55:23] but right now
[1:55:25] that word has to permeate it has to the
[1:55:28] Bible says work out your own salvation
[1:55:30] with fear and trembling carry your own
[1:55:33] salvation out to its ultimate end its
[1:55:36] ultimate conclusion its ultimate purpose
[1:55:37] why because God is working in you both
[1:55:41] to Will and to do of his good pleasure
[1:55:45] amen let's pray father
[1:55:48] oh Lord God we're so thankful for these
[1:55:51] things Lord
[1:55:53] I pray Lord that
[1:55:55] those may be struggling
[1:55:59] facing trials the outside is is is
[1:56:02] bothering them and
[1:56:07] and maybe there's there's just horrible
[1:56:11] pain that they're going through I pray
[1:56:12] that they would see this that they would
[1:56:14] hear the word that was preached today
[1:56:16] and see that it's it's a loving God
[1:56:20] bringing a circumstance to bring you to
[1:56:23] that place
[1:56:25] where the real you is being expressed
[1:56:27] that Gene of God
[1:56:30] that seed of God that's in the soul
[1:56:33] so that we're not governed by by our
[1:56:35] circumstances we're not governed by our
[1:56:39] thoughts about our circumstances but
[1:56:40] we're governed by the word becoming the
[1:56:44] word
[1:56:45] thank you Lord bring it bring healing
