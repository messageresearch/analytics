TRANSCRIPT
========================================
Lord following his place of worship father I just pray God may you just be with the service today Lord this little Sunday school lesson father than may you anoint the ministers he comes out later on Father Lord I just pray May everything be done be according to your perfect Divine will in Jesus name amen if you have your Bibles you can turn to Psalms 103 and verse 1. kind of a you'll see odd opening scripture but that's the way I felt to go this morning so we'll speak on worship from Love but let all that I am praise the Lord with my whole heart I will praise His holy name and let all that I am praise the Lord amen may I never forget the good things he does for me because he forgives all my sins and heals all my diseases and redeems me from death and crowns me with love and Tender Mercies may God add a blessings you can have your seats over in Luke chapter four you don't have to turn if they they get it they may get it up here chapter 4 verse 8. when Jesus answered and said to him get thee behind me Satan for it is written Thou shalt Worship the Lord thy God and him only shalt thou serve you know it's tempting for every person to worship someone or something we worship our money we might worship our Recreation work our worship our homes our some people worship their wives some worship their husbands because you're going to worship something you know but one thing you know the Lord does not accept our insincere worship you know if if we come to church because our mom and dad makes us and we raise our hands just to please them that's not even acceptable to God he don't even like that you might as well not even come to church if that's the case but God demands his worst all the worship be directed to him and nothing else you know when we come to this building we ought to be able to worship one thing one person and that's almighty God we're not here to worship the preacher the pastor the song leader all them all them are good men but we're not here to worship man we're here to worship one thing and ask God in John chapter 4 verse 19. very familiar you're the woman at the well the woman said to him sir I foresee that thou art a prophet she said our fathers worshiped in this mountain and ye say that in Jerusalem is a place where men ought to worship and Jesus said to her woman believe me he had no good authority he knew what he was talking about he said woman believe me the hour is coming when ye shall neither in this mountain nor yet in Jerusalem worship the father because the one we worship will be on the inside he's a you worship ye no not what he said you don't know who you're worshiping you don't know what you're worshiping he says but we know who we worship he could speak because he was the god he knew the Jews were worship the right woman because he was the one you got to know who you're worshiping today but the hour cometh and now is when the true worshipers shall worship the father in spirit and in truth for the father seeketh such to worship Him but God is a spirit and they that worship Him must worship Him in spirit and in truth you know he just got through town of her so you worship you know not what we know what we worship I hope we know what we worship this morning or who we worship I'm going to raise it do you know who it is do you have the right object of worship but in order for us to worship you got to know what worship means worship the word worship is derived from an Old English word which I can't pronounce I'm just going to say from an Old English word meaning honor shown to an object it is the simplest simplest definition worship is to give Worth to something so whatever you worship it's worth something to you a dictionary definition of worship is reverent honor and homage paid to God or a person or to any object regarded as sacred worship is honor paid to a superior being it means to give homage honor reverence respect adoration praise glory to a superior being there's a superior being in the building this morning and that's who we're worshiping first chronicles 16 29 says give to the Lord the glory do his name bring an offering and come unto him o Worship the Lord in the beauty of holiness Romans 1 20. for since the creation of this world his attributes his invisible attributes are clearly seen been understood by the things that are made even his eternal power and godhead so that they without excuse because although they knew God they did not glorify him has God nor were thankful but become futile in their thoughts well and they're foolishness of Hearts were darkened and they exchanged the truth of God for a lie and worshiped and serve the Creator create the creature more than the Creator that reminds me of the story of Nebuchadnezzar when Daniel comes to him and tells us all his visions and all things he was dreaming he thought Daniel was a god so instead of worshiping the Creator he worshiped the creature the creation and I'm afraid that's what a lot of us has done this message they sit and tell you get the preachers off the platform brother Branham is their Prophet push play and Obey I'm afraid people is worshiping the creation more than the Creator I like this statement right here I found it somebody said the gods we worship write their names on our faces it's wrote on your face you know the saying is and my wife tells me I'm this way that it's written all over your face I can't hide something goes wrong you can tell by my face something ain't right so I can't hide it so whatever you're servant is written all over your face we could go to a sermon that for a little while brother Matt can do that next time he preaches if you're wearing makeup it's wrote all over your face I can get with you for a few minutes you and you tell me your passion I've seen people come up and say oh man I've done this I've this basketball game I did I I I've got so many points it's all over their face it's written all over their face their God is written all over their face so whatever you talk about get you excited I don't care what it is I mean you could be shopping getting all excited it's written all over your face I can see it but also I love it when I'm talking to a person and they're talking about God and you can see it all over their face their God is written all over their face Hallelujah you're telling me something you're getting excited I know who you're serving I know who's God you're worshiping oh man you could just tell it the gods we worship wrote their names on our face you're gonna have something written on your face it's gonna be the mark of the beast or the Seal of God we won't get into that we know what happens all in that part but a man will worship something have no doubt about that he may think that his tribute is paid in secret in the dark recess of his heart but it will be out that which dominates will determine his life and character therefore he behooves us to be careful what we worship what we are worse been so what you are worshiping you become so if you Worship in Jesus Christ this morning watch you be coming you're becoming to live and walk and talk in Jesus Christ I want it wrote all over my face we do what we worship and we worship What We Love and Desire my goodness in scripture the word for love is agape which means totally giving oneself over to something to surrender all to it to be fully committed to the God we worship are we fully committed if it's game plan are you committed to it you're worse than something glory to God we may not bow down to idols you're not going down here and bow down oh we worship you we worship you TV monitor we're worshiping you Golf Club we're worshiping you uh Ross's hate that store worship stems from the heart we worship what we love We crave what we love we fill our lives with what we love and we submit ourselves to what we love and we are controlled by it are you controlled by your love just think about it what are you in love with this morning Mercy skip a little bit so we worship what we love what you love second Timothy 4 8 said hence for there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness which the Lord the righteous judge shall give me at that day not to me only but unto all of them also that love his appearing there's two kinds of love we got Ophelia love and agape love affiliate love is what we have one for the other husband and wife but there's only one that's that agape love is meant for God we can't love God just by our own human love we got to have his his love if you love his appearing he's coming after you that's the love it will go into rapture you know we heard the story of the woman that washed Jesus's feet Luke 7 36. and one of the Pharisees desired him that he would eat with them and he went into the Pharisees house and sat down at meat and behold a woman of the city which was a sinner when she knew that Jesus said at meat in the Pharisees house brought an alabaster box of ointment and stood At His Feet behind him weeping and begin to wash his feet with her tears and did wipe them with the hairs of her head and kissed his feet and nor them with ointment Jesus got invited to a party the big preacher that they want to be popular I have Jesus in my house I'll tell you when you invite Jesus he's going to come priest Jesus will keep his appointments it's not like us we have an appointment set for tomorrow at 2. will cause it I can't make it something's come up it don't matter God ain't gonna say hey I like so-and-so better I do you I'm gonna have to cancel my appointment with you this evening God's not like that you invite God in the building God's here he's going to keep it I'm trying not to go too fast I don't want to start preaching When God says he will be there he will be there it's like when brother Luther or somebody comes up for prayer we invite your presence to come to this church this morning be sure he's coming but what are we going to do with him when Jesus come to this party there was nobody there to wash his feet because that's what they did when he got coming off the street they had a foot wash flunky there to wash his feet clean his feet give him some new sandals clean shoes he'll go through the next door and they'll anoint him with oil his hands and his feet and he'll walk it on her face it's refreshing there was nobody to do that to him the host was there to greet him they usually greet him on the shoulder and and welcome into the you're part of the family but nobody done Jesus like that that day so they started eating having a good old time the lamb must have smelled good as Brett Brown would say the scent probably went out to the neighborhood this guy wanted his party known that he had it in his front yard where the people will go by the street and see there's Jesus hey what's he doing in there say this woman the Bible said was a great sinner and she came and she came what's going on up there it's a big party and she's seen this man sitting in a corner laying on the couch dirty and such a love went out of her she was a prostitute but it was the kind of love we were talking about I love so much love that she went and got everything she owned took all of her money and went bought this expensive oil that she was going to go in and wash his feet Hallelujah she's going to give the best she's got that's what we need to be this morning we need to come here and give God the best that we got Burrell said right down through that crowd of Pharisees she went on her way elbow on her way to Jesus God help us tonight I elbow our way through all this stuff what did you elbow your way through to come in here this morning she went right on through pushing through the Pharisees and she got right to where he was and she broke the alabaster box and poured it on him she fell down on the floor of his feet and began to weep and she was patting his feet she got kind of beside herself you imagine all the tears that come out of that woman's eyes just to wash his feet that's a lot of water because he had a lot of dirt on his feet she was at the only place that she could get her help no wonder she was so hysterical no wonder she was beside herself God help us get beside ourselves long enough to get saved anyhow I believe Jesus felt just a little more comfortable a sinner at his feet makes Jesus feel comfortable what audit might do for the bride how comfortable will he feel this morning did we go bring him in here and put him over here in a corner somewhere you sit right here Jesus there he was her washing his feet and she was kissing his feet and she got so beside herself she had all of her hair done up like you know she was washed his feet that kissed him and her hair would fall down and she would took her hair and begin to wipe his feet to kiss them wiping his feet and her hair fell down laughs some of this is Harry long enough to even dry his feet wow I hated that he didn't say it At His Feet behind him and began to wash his feet with her tears and it wiped him with the hairs of her head she started kissing on his feet then she Anointed with ointment and now when the Pharisee which had bitten him saw it he spake within himself saying this man if he were a prophet would have known who in what manner of man this is that toucheth him for she is a sinner and Jesus answered said to him Simon I have somewhat to say to thee and he says Master say on there was a certain creditor who had two debtors that one owed 500 Pence the other 50. and when they had nothing to pay he frankly forgave them both tell me therefore which of them would love him the most he answered right Simon answered said I suppose that he to whom he forgave the most and he said unto him thou has rightly judged that he turned to the woman looking at the woman he said unto Simon seeth thou this woman I entered into that house God gave us me no water for my feet but she has washed my feet with her tears and wiped in with the hairs of her head thou gave us me no kiss but this woman since the time I came in hath not ceased to kiss my feet in the worst center of the city Simon I had something to say to thee Dr Simon you invited me down here when I come because you invited me you never gave me anywhere to wash my feet you never anointed my face and hands you never kiss me Simon you didn't love me Simon if you had loved me you would wash my feet if you had loved me you would anointed me if you had anointed me love me you would have kissed me but you never made me welcome oh God we want to make you welcome this morning he said my head with the oil without this not anointed but this woman half anointed my feet with an ointment wherefore I say unto her her sins which are many are forgiven for she loved much but to whom little Is Forgiven the same loveth little for she loved much or therefore she loved much her great love was not the cause of her remission of sins but for the full and free remission of many sins which had been manifest in her was the cause of her great love and her showing it in the manners she had done this poor woman had been a great sinner and her many sins were pardoned and therefore she expressed much love to him from whom she had received her pardon by above actions much more than Simon had done but to whom little Is Forgiven the same loveth little my Jesus just turns to look at her says thy sins are forgiven and they that said it meet with him begin to say within themselves who is this that forgiveth sins also he just looked at the woman says thy faith has saved thee just go in peace that's what God is wanting a love for him like this woman she had such love that she wasn't going to see Jesus left that way do we have that love for him that we say Jesus come on in the building come on in or do we say this is my seat I've been sitting this seat for years so Jesus there's one over in the corner it's been empty for a while go sit in it or we go or will we say here Jesus take my seat we'll see Jesus come sit beside me move over for him is that what you want to do we're not going to lead Jesus off in the corner somewhere with dirty feet there should be such a love emanating out of us they should be such a love that we can't leave him that way we got to water Him worship Him with our praise that's what we're going to do this morning when brother Tony comes out here he's going to start Us in worship who we're worshiping we're not worshiping brother Tony standing up here or any of these brother brothers that leads us singing We're Not worshiping them they're leading Us in worship but we're only worshiping one thing one being that's Supernatural God is just waiting to see what you'll do he wants to drop his presence down on you he wants to start a celebration in the building here are we willing to come to this party it's not a popular party we don't have drinking in here like you suppose trying I'm trying to be good let's don't leave him in the corner with dirty feet because if you love him you won't do it he loved you so much that he came down from Glory left that where he was worshiped day and night left his crown on on the throne there and come down to pick up a stinking human flesh for us that's love that's love that's what we need to do we come in here we need a sacrifice we need to lay all that stuff aside we can't love him our human love just let that Godly Love come out of us and worship him agape love come on Jesus we love you yeah we love you Lord we love you Jesus how many loves the Lord how many really deeply down inside your soul that way down deep love the Lord Jesus that's who we're worshiping it's like when the you sisters when your husband comes home from work do you ignore him like he's knitting you come in the door do you by looks on some of these faces I think y'all might but no you'll say hello husband sorry that's what my wife says sometimes that's what we ought to do Jesus if you're married to him he comes to the door hello husband come on in what do you want to drink what do you want to eat I don't want none of that I just want your praise tell me how much you love me tell me how much you want to worship me tell me how good I've been to you you start telling God that tell God how good he's been to you worshiping God forget about all your needs just come start before him say God I love you how magnificent you are you're Alpha and your Amiga you're the beginning and the end you're my husband I love you so much and Watch What Happens some of us we just get too busy the pastor says you're dismissed we're gone we can't wait to get outside and start talking there's nothing wrong with that I'm sorry I just the way I feel sometimes the Lord if you stay here stick around a little bit longer you see what the Lord is still moving in this service after we're even gone we just got to worship Him gotta love him I love him can you tell when he comes in you just greet him so this morning have you invited him in did you come in this morning say father we need your presence here come and sit in my seat worshiping with the praise if you do that what kind of services will we have this becomes a tradition to us every Wednesday every Sunday we come in and sit down okay Lord here I am when he took time to pray we took time to worship Him I love y'all foreign why because he first loved us I'm getting ready to walk out the door you'll have a few minutes before but Tony comes out let's invite him in the building God's presence being here not one person will
