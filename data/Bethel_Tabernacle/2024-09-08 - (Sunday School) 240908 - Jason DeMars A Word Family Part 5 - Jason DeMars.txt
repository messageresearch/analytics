========================================

as we spoke about before Paul in 1 Corinthians 11 the issue is of course head coverings but more than that he's speaking about uh the order order of the order of the creation order of the family order of headship and uh hair is just a reflection of that uh of what creation order is and again people take 1 Corinthians 11 actually they take every scripture that has anything to do with man and woman and they try to say it's a cultural impact but you'll find over and over again you know uh that it isn't cultural in any case it is based on creation order uh this the next scripture that we were going to read it's the same thing the order that God has for the home and family is based on the creation the design the nature that God made man and woman with and you know uh one thing that people could sometimes reference is the seron marriage and divorce and this is sort of just a a brief side note it's a topic in and of itself but brother brandom says Satan was Eve's designer and when we hear that we think that Satan was some your initial response is he's trying to say that Satan was involved in in the creation process of Eve that that would be a misunderstanding because as you look further and look deeper into what brother branham's saying he's he said he's design he started working on her first in other words the creation happened the then the de devil this is my means of deceiving and taking over the man which he obviously is not but when we misapply what the prophet said then we are perverting the understanding and revelation of the Scripture it is it's very clear that God was the one that created the man and God was the one that created the woman and he did so with a specific design it's just that he put that design there so that his glory could be made known his his his attributes as Savior and Redeemer and healer etc etc and so that's of course a little bit of a side note but part of the foundation of what we're talking about first Tim Timothy 2:9 in like manner also that women Adorn themselves in modest apparel with shamefacedness and sobriety not with broed hair or gold or pearls or cost the array we we spent uh a little time going into the details on this scripture I'll just hit the high points which is it's God's purpose for a woman to dress modestly and there is in this verse the word apparel is not a general term for clothing just modest clothing but it is actually a specific term in fact there's a number of words within this place that Paul is using the only time that it's ever used in this context in the New Testament in the Greek New Testament and one of those words is apparel which is the word Greek word catasto stole would be a normal term that everyone would wear a stole uh that would just be the common tunic style clothing it wouldn't signify how long it is or what it is it's just like say it's just like saying a t-shirt or a shirt just in a general term a shirt but then he puts in that Kata stole which speaks of the word letting down so letting down stole which speaks of course with as a long dress that's specifically what he is speaking of and if you drill down further and look to a similar term in Hebrew is the word coutet the word cenet speaks of a garment that covers from the neck down to below the knees in in work situations it would go just below the knee in dress occasions it would go all the way a gold necklace or pearl necklace uh or a ring or a bracelet the point the point when he's speaking of this or even that she can't braid her hair there was a specific style that women used to show off their wealth and they would take strands of pearls and gold and we braid them into their hair and it was a means of showing wealth it's not a modest thing it's an immodest thing and and Paul says don't do it brother bandam even connects it with you would consider her a lude woman in that day and time there's nothing wrong with braiding the hair and we don't have the Style thank God of braiding gold and Pearls into the hair although I wouldn't be surprised to see to see it coming back one of these days with these billionaire sex uh Idols in the world am but it's speaking of D it's it's speaking of let your the way you dress be considered shamefacedness and sobriety so shamefacedness speaks of being shy sobriety speaks of being moderate not to the extremes all right let's keep moving but which becometh women professing godliness with good works let the woman learn in Silence with all subjection but I suffer not a woman to teach nor to usurp authority over the man but to be in silence why Paul for Adam was first formed then Eve why else Paul and Adam was not deceived but the woman being deceived was in the transgression not withstanding she shall be saved in childbearing if they continue in faith and charity and Holiness with sobriety again we spoke last time it's not saying that childbearing is the means of Salvation the means of Salvation is the same for men and women it's through Christ alone it's by grace through faith it's not has nothing to do with works but works accompany true faith when you have true Faith true faith is going to then produce the new the new birth the baptism of the Holy Ghost and then when you have that new nature it's going to produce new works and so Paul is drilling down and saying specifically a woman is ordained to different Works than a man is ordained to so her salvation is accompanied by childbearing if you continue in faith and charity and Holiness with sobriety and when he's speaking of childbearing he's not just saying only the act of childbearing but he's speaking of that nurturing nature that that purpose that plan childbearing child nurturing keeping the home everything it's like putting all the encompassing work of a woman into one simple phrase which is her her specific design that's why Eve was made was to Bear children I know that is not good feminism but thank God we are fighting as hard as we can against the spirit of feminism and we'll speak more about the origins of its release probably next time I doubt we'll get to that that this time in the sermon marriage and divorce notice the reason that she did this she was not in the original creation she's not in God's original creation she's a byproduct therefore at the beginning as Jesus referred to it she was not original creative being of God she is a byproduct of a man when Jesus referred to the beginning remember Adam was both masculine and feminist in the original creation one but then he was separated by a rib notice but a byproduct and notice the only one of all God's creation of every animal and anything else she was the only one designed this way every other female was in the original creation every other female was in the original creation but Eve was not in the original creation see that had to be made that way we'll get to it after a while notice in this creation that she was in not in the original but a byproduct and in this creation there is now I don't want to hurt your feelings but I want to tell you the truth and you just sit still you're doing nice there's nothing designed to be so deceitful as a woman that's deceitful there cannot be nothing else there is nothing made to be that way also is there's nothing that can be so easily deceived as a woman now the fall proves this statement to be true the fall in the beginning she was not in the original creation she was in Adam but not in a female sex herself at the beginning she was the bi byproduct made amen we live in such an evil age that we that we all listen to marriage and divorce the first time and it's like we're getting take a sledgehammer taken to our brains let's be honest with ourselves because the age is so deceiving it shouldn't be that way keep listening to it over and over again so it's not like a sledgehammer because the reason it's a sledg hammer is because perhaps our thinking is perverted and that's what the need for the renewing of our mind is no brother brandham is not denigrating a real godly woman it's it's the Tendencies it's the direction and it's the spirit of the age that he was living in it's not a Godly woman that would be living according to the word that he's speaking about however it is part of the original design and it is part of part of the issue why why do I say that God's original design would have precluded would have prevented the woman from being able to teach or preach or usurp authority over the man it's very clear wh why is that because Adam was first formed So Adam being first formed he is in as the prophet said the original creation now then God put Adam to sleep and took from his side a rib and made Eve so she came out remember how did that process go what was God looking at he said it's not good for for the man to be alone I will make him and help meat so Eve was designed for the purpose of fulfilling something for Adam so Adam wasn't made for the woman the woman was the Eve was made for Adam she's a secondary creation off of him and the prophet gives us reveals this mystery that this is the reason why she could be more easily deceived because she was not in the original creation if you were in the original creation you couldn't be deceived right so because she's off of Adam now she's subject doesn't mean she's necessarily going to be but that she's subject to being deceived so part of part of the nature of how she is created results in the fact that a woman is more easily deceived this is not just a historical Doctrine Paul is saying referring to the creation or impacting on why a woman can't teach or usurp authority over a man amen again we can we can sit here and feel uncomfortable about it or we can just say this is the word we love it once once a person knows who they truly are and knows what their position really is it's not a burden to know what your position is it's a joy to know what your position is now now I can finally feel at rest to be what God really made me to be and to understand the implications of the creation order so again Paul is basing his whole argument not on the fall well the the fall happened and therefore this happen and this is what modern Christian feminist feminists teach and preach the the headship of man is based on the fall and the curse only and therefore uh through Christ all of that is waved off now a woman can preach now a woman can have authority over the man well what in the world is Paul saying this to the New Testament Church he's writing this literally he's actually writing it to Timothy to enact in Ephesus amen so he's saying he's saying this is what I want to happen Timothy and he doesn't say because the Greco Roman culture um regards the man as the patriarch you have to do this in the church no he says Adam was first formed and he was deceived so he takes that historical fact and he brings it forward and places it in the church and says this is why a woman can't teach or preach and why she must remain silent in the church and again the implications are not just for Eve the implications are for all all women to follow just like when Eve when when Adam was cursed it wasn't just a curse for Adam it was for all men following when Eve was cursed it wasn't just for Eve it was for all women following that now let's just take some time to set this in order a woman not be in a position of teaching a man from the Bible that's that's totally out of her order that's totally out of position she cannot be in a position of pastoring a church she cannot be in a position of teaching Sunday school to men she cannot be in a position where she's teaching Doctrine to some man it's the implication here is people will say this is only in the church setting so out of the church setting she can teach theology in a seminary well Seminary is a perversion anyways the place that ministers are supposed to be trained are there in the local church from the the existing Ministry that's there to help them and to train them and raise them up by the power of the holy spirit so there's not some separate office or SE separate place now but the scripture does tell us in a few different places that there is a is a place for a woman to teach isn't that right let's look at the scripture this is from the um uh Jewish translation from the Hebrew Proverbs 1 18 hear my son the instruction of thy father and forsake not the teaching of thy mother so a mother is to teach her family again if we remember from from before this is not to be some remember it says the instruction of thy father and the teaching of thy mother so it's not taking the duty of teaching the family and throwing it only onto mother Ephesians 6:4 specifically says fathers provoke not your children under wrath but raise them up in the instruction and discipline of the Lord so it is first and foremost the father's purview to be sure that he is teaching his family and disciplining his family the mother is then the helper in this Vision the father can't simply say I abdicate my spot here you do it that's not the scriptural intention he is supposed to be the head and the leader of this process but his wife is there also to instruct the children and so we can take from this and understand that in a church setting a sister could a mature sister could instruct children in a Sunday school class as well Titus 2 3-5 I only bring that up just to refer to it speaks of the aged women that she should teach teach who the men no that's usurping the the authority and she's out of position when she does that the aged women or the older women should teach the younger women what theology Doctrine no Christian Living house household duties how to love your husbands how to be sober how to love your children etc etc again so so it's not that a woman is so stupid she can't teach that's not what what Paul is bringing and that's not what Paul is teaching but it's also clear that you know that the woman shouldn't try to teach a man even when Peter says when it's a situation where the wife is a Believer and the husband is UN an unbeliever he says that W that wives should without the word win their husbands using her conduct and character and how she lives as a Believer amen all right continue on and let's look at some quotes from Brother branam regarding these things and when you see a woman acting like a man now again I'm just going to State this General principle is when brother brandham was speaking uh it was not only was the bride in an infant stage or in a seed phase of the true bride being planted but also the prophetic word that was coming forth things that he was re rebuking are Child's Play compared to what we're dealing with if you were back there you would probably think brother bradam why are you getting so carried away it's not that bad but he wasn't speaking just about that time he was speaking prophetically of what was to come and so when you can see that now bring this what he's speaking and you could see that it applies so perfectly to our age in fact it it it applies so well that when we read it we go because we're so we're we're literally swimming in a pool a Cess pool of feminism amen that's this that's the bottomless pit that has been that was opened up in World War I and that's produced this very thing the very things that were produced as soon as the bottomless pit were opened up as we saw in in the fifth trumpet it speaks about hair they had these locusts with hair like women that would haunt the women well what did that haunting produce we see it today the perversion upon women so he says when you see a woman acting like a man she's got out of her place you see in the beginning all right she's I think it's a shame that women has lost their dainty feminist spirit it's a disgrace I tell you it is you know I'm going to say this now I'm not talking about you women here but of course if it hurts it ju it just does but look at me look let me ask you something it used to be that women was so feminist till a man would go to talking to them and they'd blush H what is blushing anyhow I haven't seen it so long I wouldn't even know what it was if some woman blushed they haven't got any of that dignity anymore all that their fine femin Fe feminist Spirit they'll wear clothes like a man cut their hair like a man smoke like a man drink like a man cuss like a man vote like a man work like a man so become rough Burly oh my that shows where you you've got to that's exactly that ladylike you don't see her much more she's a hard person to find isn't that right yes that's the truth so a woman is not supposed to stand up and act like a man big and Burly because she's dainty amen sisters I just want to say say this the spirit of the age can come in and it can pervert the spirit but I just want to encourage you that doesn't have to be what the prophet said can be in you you could say Lord maybe I'm lacking create this spirit in me and God can do it amen amen it's the same it's the same application of wisdom how many of you lack wisdom in certain C situations all of us and he said God tells us if any of you lack Wisdom ask ask in faith God will provide it God Will Supply it the same goes with any anything in that you're lacking if you're lacking humility if you're lacking uh sincerity if you're lacking that feminist Spirit ask God ask God to bring it to you 1 Timothy 5:14 I there I will therefore that the younger women marry bear children guide the house give none occasion to the adversary to speak reproachfully now America Europe Africa everywhere we go we find this Spirit going around the world and that is that there is not a vision to teach this specific scripture to young people to Young sisters what is it everywhere they want to go out and get an education in a university and have a degree now again maybe that's maybe that's something that God has called someone to but it brother brandham presents that more as an exception to the rule rather than the rule because there are circumstances and situations where maybe a husband is is sick disabled etc etc or you feel you could you could also say that's the situation that brother brandham brings up himself or you could say perhaps there's a situation where she feels a calling to be single her whole life maybe that's the case and she would go and and pursue something that would be a womanly type career however that's again a great exception to the rule and really as fathers and in the church we should be pointing people not to the exception but to the scripture uh and I'm just going to say boldly say this from what I see in being a missionary going around the world is this is what we've turned the scripture into I will therefore that the younger women go to university get a career and perhaps if it should might happen can get married and subtract all of that stuff that's not what it says amen I will therefore that the younger women marry bear children guide the house why Paul because it gives an occasion to the adversary to speak reproachfully in the other place that we'll read probably not this time but next time in Titus 2 it says say if a woman wouldn't have this vision and direction for her life that it would be a blasphemy against the word of God and so you could say well our culture demands that we do this and this or all the boys are a bunch of sissies and they they're not growing up and being men they just sit around and play video games and don't learn how to take responsibility therefore a woman should do this well that's another problem fathers what in the world are you doing you're supposed to teach your sons to take responsibility part of being a man is being responsible having a job knowing how to be a provider the scripture says nothing about being really good at video games and I can I can I can go into it it's feminizing men because why you're you're instead of expressing your man your manliness in this Dimension you're expressing it expressing it only in the fourth dimension and when you express manliness only in the fourth dimension it turns you into a I love you I was a young man once believe it or not too I played video games too but I also played Sports and I also got out and into the world the world was a very different place back then but video games are not doing you any favors it would be better for you to forget about video games and go chop some wood learn responsibility and so it's it's a as the prophet said it's a trickle up syndrome you say it's it's juvenile delinquency well no it's parent delinquency well no it's Pulpit delinquency so there's somewhere there's a disconnect from here to here and so I I'm I'm not here to uh rebuke anybody specifically that's not in my heart I have no one in my in in mind this is a general problem that we see around the world it's a spirit of the age but I'll tell you this that it it won't be it it won't change until father and mothers change the vision of their children and so again there's no scripture that says a father can abdicate his authority and a pastor has to take its place the father must take responsibility for leading his family actually if you understand it correctly the truest form of government in the world is not the federal government in Washington DC neither it is it our is it our governor and wherever the heck he is neither is it the mayor many times those things are perverted what's the truest form of government it's the family it's the father he's a ruler he's the Lord of his family and if he doesn't take that Authority the family is going to suffer he must understand his authority to lead his sons and say stop being a boy stop being a little mama's boy it's time to come out it's time to come out from her Apron Strings and be a man it's time to tell the girls to say your purpose in life is to be a mother to be a wife to raise children and to be the best that you can be at that whether you're a boy or a girl for a for a boy you need to develop a work eth amen that you work hard that you're willing to sweat that you're will willing to use your body to provide for a family as a woman and we're training our daughters we have to we have to be willing to train them in the direction that they're supposed to go I don't there's no scripture about government school and university did you know that but there is a scripture about parents instructing their children in the way that they should go so the first Duty and responsibility of Education and Training and teaching is not the church it's not the pastor it's Mom and Dad it's not the government schools it's not the corporate government system it's not the universities it's Mom and Dad and we miss this and we think and we think because I grew up in America or Africa or wherever it is and the system of government schools is in place this is how we must do no it isn't I know I'm you probably think I'm a fanatic but I'm just pointing you to the responsibility of the word the rest the rest you find the leadership of the Holy Spirit but I'm pointing you to the responsibility of the word amen let's pray let's stand Heavenly Father we thank you so much for this glorious message Lord
