(Sunday School) Pride - Mathew Smith
TRANSCRIPT
========================================
Lord, we come before you this morning, Lord, to gather together for a Sunday school lesson. Lord, that if we'd be dependent upon this man, this this flesh of mine to bring some lessons that it'd be a useless lesson, Father, it'd be nothing of value. But Lord, that we're turning to you, that you would speak, that I would offer up myself for you to speak through me, and that the people would be encouraged and blessed, that they would be uh uplifted where uplifting would need and and chastised where chastisement would be needed, and that correction begins at the house of the Lord. But encouragement and healing begins there as well. So, Father, we ask that you would be with us this morning, that we could as we look into the word that it would have need of whatever it is that we would have need of would be met. We ask these things in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; Um, we want to turn um to Isaiah 14 and verse 12 this morning. Um, Did I get that 14 and verse 12 and it says, "How art thou fallen from heaven, oh Lucifer, son of the morning? How art thou cut down to the ground which d weaken the nations? For thou hast said in thine heart, I will ascend into heaven. I will exalt my throne above the stars of God. I will sit also upon the mount of the congregation in the sides of the north. I will ascend above the heights of the clouds. I will be like the most high. Yet thou shalt be brought down to hell, to the sides of the pit, that uh they that see thee shall narrowly look upon thee, and consider thee, saying, Is this the man that made the earth to tremble, that did shake kingdoms? You all can be seated as the Lord would add blessing to the word. Um I want to speak this morning um the name of my this thought um I've named pride. Um obviously we're hopefully hopefully we're familiar with this scripture. um is very uh you know common reference when we're talking about the origin of not only of Lucifer but this is the this is the moment in which you know there was a war in heaven began right like this is a moment in which we now have a deviation from the plan of God or not necessarily I mean all things are in the plan of God but this is a moment in which you have a conflict between what God wants and what this other entity wants right &gt;&gt; amen &gt;&gt; this is kind of the origin of of all the all the misery and hate and destruction and and you know awful things that we can think of all started right there, &gt;&gt; right? It all started with Lucifer wanting to raise himself above God's congregation. &gt;&gt; And it's I think it's important that we look at origin. If there's anything that I would say that is a a theme that you could run through the entire message of the hour, it is that um origin is a termination of outcome. Right? Or your outcomes are indication of your origin. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Right? The fulfillment of something is only a manifestation of where it started. And where things start is going to be a direct line to where you're going to end. &gt;&gt; Amen. And one, you know, we this is just a fulfillment of the principle that every seed brings forth after its own kind. And I don't think that we can really understand where we are today in this day and hour. Um, unless we get back to a lot of the original ideas that God had for humanity, right? That what was the purpose that God had for man when he made uh man? what was the what was you know the the big question why are we here right obviously not why are these people in this building today but why is humanity on the earth what was the point of all that &gt;&gt; um and you know if we want to look at the spirits that we have today we we obviously were you know taught well that we're surrounded we are in Satan's Eden we are surrounded by evil spirits we're surrounded by darkness we're surrounded by things that frankly to the h to the, you know, to the saint seems like this is madness. This is absolute insanity. &gt;&gt; Um, but you'll only ever be able to really figure out, you'll only understand why things are the way they are if we go back and look at how they started, right? We'll only understand what happened in is going on in the book of Revelations if we know what happened in the book of Genesis, right? You'll only, you know, brother Brandham said that the the um the seeds of every everything in Revelation in the book of Revelations got is was seeded. It was Genesis is the seed book, right? Everything was planted in Genesis that ultimately sprouted and grew and bear fruit in Revelation, which is where we are. &gt;&gt; Yeah. And um you know we the Bible the and we in revelations we hear a lot about things like the mark of the beast and the antichrist and um you know that's something especially even amongst the sort of the nominal Christian world and even the secular world that especially in this this time when everything seems so chaotic and and and at risk and it seems like even you don't even have to be a Christian it seems like and people are realizing that the end of the world is upon right? We're getting down to the down to the end and people are starting to really um a lot of this stuff comes up, you know, and so I think it behooves us if we're going to be the people who are in opposition to the Antichrist spirit. It really behooves us to really figure out what that is, &gt;&gt; right? You can't be in opposition to something that you don't understand. You can't be in opposition to something that you don't know what it is. You can't defend yourself against something that you can't see, &gt;&gt; right? Um, and so I want to uh look and I we let's turn to Genesis chapter 4 and verse 8. And I think this is I think an excellent um representation. is really, as far as I can tell, one of, if not the first really good glimpse in the Bible of what the Antichrist spirit looks like, how it manifests, and which included in that is the mark of the beast. And it says um uh and Abel, let's see, where's my reading? We'll go down to verse eight. And Cain talked with Abel his brother. And it came to pass when they were in the field that Cain rose up against Abel his brother, and slew him. And the Lord said unto Cain, "Where is Abel thy brother?" And he said, "I know not. Am I my brother's keeper?" And he said, "What hast thou done? The voice of thy brother's blood crith unto me from the ground." Uh, and uh, now thou art cursed from the earth, which hath opened her mouth to receive thy brother's blood from thy hand. I want to skip down to verse 15. And the Lord said unto him, um, uh, see, yeah. And the Lord said unto him, therefore, whosoever slayth Cain, vengeance shall be taken on him sevenfold. And the Lord set a mark upon Cain, lest any finding him should kill him. And so, here is Cain. And you know, I'm sure we're all familiar with the story. This is the adult Sunday school class. Um the uh you know, the you know, Cain was Cain was warned ahead of time. &gt;&gt; You know, we know the story. Kane, you know, if you're taught at all in the scripture, you understand these people were not Cain wasn't non-religious. He wasn't um completely he wasn't an atheist. He wasn't uh completely against you know the living right. I would I mean just consider this. If Abel got the revelation that blood was required to atone doesn't that kind of imply that Abel was felt guilty about something so strongly that he knew blood was only going to fix it? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Right. Abel knew that there was like he recognized that what was needed was blood. On a on a outwardfacing level on a on a from the outside looking at the these two brothers I would hazard a guess that Cain looked a lot holier than Abel did from the outside. &gt;&gt; Right? Cain's sacrifice was beautiful. Cain's uh religion was beautiful. Cain had this beautiful thing. But when it came down to it, when they came into the presence of the Lord, the deciding factor between who was the seed of the serpent and who was not came down to their reaction to the word of the Lord. Yes. &gt;&gt; And another thing that we see here is that one of the defining features of a Lucifer spirit of an antichrist spirit of of evil actual evil is the evasion of accountability. &gt;&gt; Okay? When somebody is confronted with the word of God, when somebody is confronted with here's you're not living right and here's why. here's here's the the line and order of God's word and and you're not measuring up to that. The first thing someone will do if they're operating under the spirit of of Lucifer will evade accountability &gt;&gt; always what what did what did uh when God comes to come to Adam and Eve in the garden they they were trying to cover themselves God asks Adam who gave you the fruit oh that woman you gave me Adam's evading accountability he's evading responsibility doesn't want to admit fault right Cain as soon as he he uh he kills his brother and God comes to him. What does he say? Well, I don't know what happened to him. Am I am I his keeper? Right? He wants to he wants to evade. He doesn't want to confront what he did. And I mean and you this pattern follows all through the scripture &gt;&gt; every time somebody you know when it's the exact same uh as to paraphrase brother Brandham. I don't have it in my notes. It's just kind of come to me. He there's a a quote where he says, you know, we we know that, you know, God doesn't send sinners to hell. He sends rejectors to hell, right? And in that he says, God won't send someone to hell for being a sinner. He'll only send someone to hell because they remained a sinner when they didn't have to. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; The defining feature, I mean, as brother JD has been teaching, um, which I think is very, very good. You should all listen to that if you haven't. Um about the uh David versus Saul, how Saul, you know, he he was given a commandment to go do something. He he didn't kill all the didn't slaughter everything. He took he flew upon the spoils. He brought a bunch of people back, took the king alive. And then when the prophet comes to him and confronts him on this, he says, "Oh, the people did it. &gt;&gt; The people took the spoils." Well, sorry, Saul. The buck stops with you, buddy. like you're the you're the king. You you sat on your hands and didn't do anything when you saw them doing this. You the buck stops with you. You don't get to say and I I truly feel like this is this is a an exhortation to anyone, myself included, if if nobody else, right? Anyone who is in a leadership position, okay? Whether you are a a a husband to a wife, a father to children, a mother to your children, a minister, whatever your situation is, if you are in a leadership position, and your instinct is to let let the people under you take the blame for things, that is antichrist spirit. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Period. Okay. What was the nature of Christ? that people that when he did nothing wrong, Christ did everything right. And yet the people under him, he took their blame on himself. &gt;&gt; That is the nature of Christ to accept blame and accept judgment even when you don't deserve it because you're in charge. They're your responsibility. They're they're under you. And so when when uh when uh parents want to say, "Well, my kids are doing wrong and it's on that's not my, you know, I'm not going to accept blame for that." You might not accept it, but God doesn't see it that way. &gt;&gt; Okay? God will lay that blame upon you, &gt;&gt; right? There's even a a a I I I read this before. I don't again I don't have it. This is kind of coming to me. I believe it's in doors and door and doors in Flagstaff I think is when he preached this. Um I don't quote me on that though my memory memory may uh may fail me there. But um brother Brandon in dealing with uh young men who um he's talking about these young these young boys who he saw them in a I think a restaurant come in and they're all sloppy and their hair's not cut and they're you know got hair hanging down and and he called them uh uh you know just just disheveled and and um I think he called them like look like trying to look like the Beatles. and he said that any man who would hire a young man that looked like that uh couldn't even call themselves a Christian. Okay? Even when it comes down to employers in their hiring decisions, who you hire, who you voluntarily associate with your name as a and reputation as a Christian, right? That level of leadership, like even at that level of leadership, you are responsible for what people do. If you accept that level of leadership, this is why this is why uh it is so vitally important, vitally important, life and death important that when we are talking about courtship, when we are talking about uh you know getting young people getting ready to get married and start their own families that we need to be absolutely positive, be on any shadow of a doubt that the young men who are going to be going to become heads of household actually have the spirit of God inside of them living through them and with the Holy Ghost. You you do not want to play games with that. We need to have a revelation of headship. We need to have a revelation of what that means, right? Leadership is not I sit at the back and point fingers of where to go and what to do. Leadership means the first one in line, right? There's a um a famous speech in which Alexander the Great, great general, you know, led his armies, conquered half the world, basically the entire known world at that time. He gets to a point and all of his men were getting ready to abandon him um because they felt like he wasn't appreciating them. And he has this great speech where he basically says, "Shame on all of you. Shame on you. you how many time you guys are sitting here you know laying charge against me but any time that there was uh you know when we went to battle I was the first one in the charge I've got scars all over my body you know there'sn't a single part of my body that doesn't have scars on it cuz I was wounded in the battle just like you you know I you know there's there's when the when it was time to collect spoils I didn't take hardly anything I gave everything to my men you know uh there's there's when it was time to you know uh stand out you know lose some sleep so you can be on nightw watch. I Alexander was the was in the line too. Alexander didn't didn't uh um sure like he he didn't think well I'm the king I'm I'm the boss I can just do whatever I want you know and let the peeons take care of the the no he was the first one in line and because of that his men would have followed him to the end of the earth they were ready to &gt;&gt; and and that's you know that's a a carnal example but I mean even even amongst carnal people we recognize it's it's so clear when Uh true leadership is being the first one to take the responsibility. &gt;&gt; You know, you can't &gt;&gt; you can't expect your children to rise higher than your level of spirituality. &gt;&gt; Okay? You you you'll you have to lift them up to where you're at. And if they're not higher, like if they're not up to that level, then you need to climb higher, &gt;&gt; right? You need to climb higher. lift people up with you as you go higher the you know and that's that's for anyone who wants to be in a leadership position anyone who wants to be a leader even amongst I mean we can get all the way from the level of ministry all the way down to the level of if you think you're a leader amongst you know a a youth person like a young person who's seen as a leader of your friend group you have a responsibility to be raising people higher &gt;&gt; right if people are looking to you for leadership, then be a a proper leader. Be a true leader. Your your influence on people matters. And the what you push people towards or pull people towards will you will be held accountable for that. &gt;&gt; Um that was a rabbit trail I did not intend to go down. Um at least not to that to that extent. Um but yeah, so with David, we know that when when David did wrong that the an the prophet came to him, David immediately accepted accountability, &gt;&gt; right? Immediately repented, immediately uh uh turned from what he had done. Um we know with the sin with Bashibba again, um when he had um uh where do I have this? Um uh in 2 Samuel 24:17, David had brought a census and which was he wasn't supposed to do that and so the Lord was going to punish him. And there came a plague and what did David say? Lord, he could see the angel wiping the people out with pestilence. He said, "Lord, I've done wrong, but what have these sheep done? What have my sheep done? &gt;&gt; My the people that you've put over me, they didn't do anything wrong. I did wrong. Punish me." Right? Don't the mark of a true headship, the mark of a true leader, the mark of someone who is um going to fulfill the role of of a headship in accordance with Christ will not be so proud that he will avoid responsibility. He will always accept blame, always expect accept responsibility even when it's not really his fault. &gt;&gt; Right? Because even Moses, even Moses said when the people had built the golden calf, Moses when God was I'm going to wipe them out, Moses, we're going to restart with you. And Moses says, "Well, if you're going to if you're going to destroy them, then blot my name out of the book, too." Right? The leader will not expect his people to be punished or or destroyed without being the first one in line for destruction, right? Because it's his responsibility no matter where, you know, what part of that you're on. Um, now the the key thing that I want to get at here is this avoiding of responsibility, avoiding of uh accountability and trying to evade and say, well, it's not my fault or I have some excuse or it's, you know, here's some gray area or I'm going to create my, you know, ludicrous legal theory as to why I have these quotes in these scriptures and I'm going to concoct some amalgamation to justify by this thing that in 99.999% of every quotes that you know you can come up with it's flatly condemned and yet you have some contraption that you've built out of you know and now and now you're going to justify some action. Look, I mean that kind of attitude just shows that again it's you're you're avoiding accountability. you're avoiding when when the the word is coming and trying to bring you into something beautiful, right? If the if you believe that God loves you, then you believe that God want wants what's best for you, right? It's showing there's a lack of trust. It's showing when people are avoiding accountability and avoiding facing the consequences of what they've done. It shows that there there's a there's fear there, right? It's either it's either one of two things. either pride, they they just cannot stand the thought of facing um that they weren't actually as good as they thought they were. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Which actually, I think I'm I'm just going to skip down to something real quick. Um let's go to uh Romans chapter 1. I only have a few more minutes. Time just flies. Um uh I want to turn to Romans chapter 1. and we're going to go to verse 18 um actually we'll go to verse 19. It says because they uh because that which may be known of God is manifest in him in them. For God hath showed it unto them. For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen being understood by the things that are made even his external power and godhead. So that so that they are without excuse. Because that right when they knew God, they glorified him not as God, neither were thankful, but became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened. Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools, and changed the glory of the uncorruptible God into an image made like to corruptible man, and and to birds, and for-footed beasts, and creeping things. Wherefore God also gave them up to uncleanness through the lust of their own hearts to dishonor their own bodies between uh between themselves who changed the truth of God into a lie and worshiped and served the creature more than the creator who is blessed forever. Amen. So here's Paul laying out why humanity when confront when when shown that there that there's the the realities of God, right? Shown the realities of God that they would make instead of worshiping God as God and submitting to God, they'll make a they'll fabricate something that's in the image of something of of the creation. Right? And I like where he says in the image of corruptible man, we might not worship 4-footed beasts and we might not worship birds and trees and whatever, but in this day and age, we sure do worship us some people, &gt;&gt; right? 90% of the time, it's the one that looks at you from the mirror, right? Most of the time, and if you keep reading, what does he do? Um, uh, that they would be turned under like under a a reprobate mind. And it goes down this list. Um, and even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge, God gave them over to a reprobate mind to do those things which were not convenient, being filled with all unrighteousness, fornication, wickedness, covetousness, maliciousness, full of envy, murder, debate, deceit, malignity, whisperers, backbiters, haters of God, despiteful, proud, boasters, inventors of evil things, disobedient to parents, without understanding, uh, covenant breakers, ers without natural affection, implacable and unmerciful. This is what God would turn people over to because they chose to worship things that look like themselves. &gt;&gt; Right? We we want to have our own way. We want to have look at, you know, we don't want to admit fault and say we're wrong. We don't, you know, we've been exposed by the word. And then instead of instead of saying I'm wrong, Lord, forgive me. I I've done wrong and let me change. We'll make an evasion, we'll make an excuse, we'll say, well, no, that there's I have some justification for some some reason. And when you do that, and you keep doing that over and over and over again, eventually you've built an idol to your own pride. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Right. You've built an idol out of your own pride. And God is not going to allow an altar, a an idol, idolatrous thing, an an idol worship, especially if you're one of his own, &gt;&gt; right? God God will tear down every idol. And so what does he do when people want to build an idol out of themselves? Then he'll turn them over to all these other things to desecrate that. &gt;&gt; He will tear it down. You want to be proud? Okay, fine. You will become awful, right? You will everything in your heart will be manifest and it will become awful, right? It will it will disintegrate and break down into um you know and just so many different things, any aspect you can think of, everything from murder all the way down to children disobeying parents, right? Which I mean, think of that. God put gossip and disobedience of parents into the same box as murder, &gt;&gt; right? This is because what it boils down to actually what it actually boils down to going back to Saul and David, what what Saul did from the outside perspective doesn't really even look all that bad. Especially when you get to the point where he said, "Well, we were going to sacrifice the animals, right? They were still going to die. He was still going to kill them. We're just going to kill them over here instead of over there." What's the big deal, Samuel? Right. From the outside perspective, the things that uh that Saul did, honestly, from our perspective, didn't look anywhere near as bad as what David had done. The difference was not what they did. The sin is practically irrelevant to God. All sin is worthy unto death. All of it. The difference is whether or not you're willing to repent &gt;&gt; because repentance is the first step of redemption. What time do I have here? Repentance is the first step of redemption. Uh very very briefly and I'll I'll button it up here. Um let me go to Acts chapter 2 starting in verse 22. You men of Israel, hear these words. Jesus of Nazareth, a man approved of God among you by miracles and wonders and signs which God did by him in the midst of you, as ye yourselves also know. Him being delivered by determinate counsel and fornowledge of God, ye have taken and by wicked hands have crucified him. And then skipping down to verse 37. Now when they heard this, they were pricricked in their heart and said unto Peter and to the rest of the apostles, men and brethren, what shall we do? Then Peter said unto him unto them, repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and you shall receive the gift gift of the Holy Ghost. For the promises unto you, and to your children, and all that are a far off,
