[4:06] [Applause]
[4:08] With all my

[4:45] all that you are worth. Let it be Lord

[5:02] Let's give the Lord a hand clap of
[5:04] praise this morning. Amen. Brother
[5:07] Luther, you come and take up the
[5:09] offering. Let's sing that just that
[5:11] chorus ac cappella. All my soul
[5:16] [Music]
[5:18] needs
[5:20] is all your love
[5:25] to cover me.
[5:28] to all the world
[5:34] will see
[5:36] that I am nothing
[5:42] without
[5:43] you.
[5:46] &gt;&gt; That sounds lovely. So when we were uh
[5:51] so what does the world see when it sees
[5:53] you? Amen. I just um with a Sunday
[5:57] school lesson like that, you know, I can
[5:59] look back. I'm in the later stages of
[6:02] life, have grandkids and stuff and I can
[6:05] see where my children are at and I can
[6:09] I can beat myself up actually. You know,
[6:11] there so many
[6:13] so many instances where I think, you
[6:15] know, I could have done things
[6:16] differently.
[6:18] But the um problem is at that time I
[6:21] didn't.
[6:23] So I'm still looking at the grace of God
[6:26] today, you know, that says without him I
[6:29] can do nothing but with him I can do all
[6:31] things and I can believe in the token
[6:37] [Music]
[6:38] that can do things that I can't do.
[6:42] Amen. I love the Lord this morning. You
[6:44] love the Lord.
[6:46] Are you thankful for what he has done?
[6:49] Amen. Yes. We're fallen in a fallen
[6:51] condition. But you know that a sacrifice
[6:53] that he made, it overrules it all.
[6:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[6:57] &gt;&gt; Total victory in Christ. Amen. Let's
[7:00] pray. Father, I love you this morning.
[7:05] And Lord, I can look at I can't point
[7:07] fingers at anybody else, Father.
[7:10] No one else is living in this vessel. No
[7:13] one else is living this life that I walk
[7:15] in these shoes.
[7:17] But I pray that you help me, Father. And
[7:20] as I ask that you help each and every
[7:22] one of us, Father,
[7:24] Lord, you've set a goal and a purpose
[7:26] before us. Help us to meet that, Lord.
[7:30] You made the way. You finished the work
[7:32] at Calvary. Father, you died for the
[7:34] sins of the world.
[7:37] Redeeming grace.
[7:39] &gt;&gt; Thank you
[7:40] &gt;&gt; for God's fallen grace. We love you this
[7:43] morning. We pray that you just have your
[7:45] way.
[7:46] Thank you for the wonderful song that
[7:48] was sung. Father, your presence is so
[7:50] nice, so wonderful. Lord, help us, Lord,
[7:55] just to forget about today's cares.
[7:58] Just surrender our lives and hearts to
[8:00] you this morning, Lord. You could
[8:03] comfort us, strengthen us. Give us a
[8:06] renewed strength and vigor to to walk
[8:08] before you so that the world will see
[8:11] something besides ourselves that they
[8:14] will see you. As we collect the tithes
[8:17] and offerings, Father, I pray that you
[8:18] bless the cheerful giver and Lord, I'm
[8:21] so thankful
[8:24] that you have a see your forgetfulness.
[8:26] Ask that you would just toss all my
[8:28] wrongs
[8:30] in that place and help me Lord to forget
[8:32] them also. I pray in Jesus name. Amen.
[8:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. Why don't you greet one another in
[8:39] the name of the Lord today?

[21:56] just look up and see the mighty
[22:01] hand of God. He's reaching down. Oh,
[22:06] speak God's name and Satan trembles.
[22:11] Speak God's words and watch him flame.
[22:17] Once again,
[22:19] my God delivers. The mountain crumbles
[22:24] and your face.
[22:28] So speak to the mountain.
[22:33] You'll not triumph
[22:35] over me.

[35:26] been all my life, bro?
[35:30] Amen. Praise God. Man, you love the
[35:34] Lord.
[35:34] &gt;&gt; It's good to be a Christian, isn't it?
[35:37] &gt;&gt; Sure was enjoying all that worship and I
[35:40] was listening um from the Sunday school
[35:43] on and uh just enjoying that class and
[35:46] then the to hear the worship get
[35:48] underway and uh I just was paying close
[35:51] attention to even the songs brother Ken
[35:54] was using and and I just thought it was
[35:57] such a ministry. I and the um the
[35:59] specials, you know, hearing Sister Sarah
[36:02] sing and you know, I I just love it when
[36:06] you know, you can just be right in the
[36:08] middle of something and just still sing
[36:10] out to the Lord.
[36:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. And so sure was
[36:14] appreciating that, Sister Sarah. That
[36:15] song Brother Aaron sung. My I love that
[36:17] song. Told him I might have him come up
[36:19] at the end and sing it again. Not sure.
[36:21] We'll see how the anointing goes, but I
[36:24] sure loved it. Amen.
[36:27] Luke chapter 21.
[36:29] Amen. We want to continue today in our
[36:31] 10th installment. I I hope I tr I am
[36:34] going to make an attempt to finish this
[36:36] series. Amen. We'll see. Um give you the
[36:41] give you the give you the the Trump
[36:42] oneliner. We'll see. We'll see. I don't
[36:45] know. We'll see.
[36:48] Amen. I want to say, Mr. President, do
[36:51] you know anything? We'll see.
[36:54] Amen. Praise the Lord. Luke 21.
[36:59] Now,
[37:02] normally
[37:03] we would read this passage out of
[37:05] Matthew 24. And we probably will go
[37:08] there. It's in my notes to go there and
[37:10] and refer to it because it's what's most
[37:13] familiar. It's where brother Brandham
[37:15] would go into Matthew 24 over and over
[37:16] and over again.
[37:18] That's where, you know, many shall come
[37:20] in my name and many false Christs, many
[37:23] false prophets and deceive many. And um
[37:26] the reason I'm choosing Luke today on
[37:29] purpose is to just attach in your mind
[37:35] that that this is the continuation
[37:38] of of a dissertation he's having that
[37:41] you would be familiar with starting in
[37:43] Luke 17. As it was in the days of Lot,
[37:48] &gt;&gt; as it was in the days of Noah, so shall
[37:51] it be in the coming of the son of man. A
[37:54] lot of times we read Luke 17 and30 and
[37:58] we read it in isolation like like as if
[38:01] it's just one little, you know, and I've
[38:04] even had it said to me, that's a that's
[38:06] a little bit of a thin case. You're just
[38:07] going to that you're picking out one
[38:09] verse, but I'm not. It's actually a
[38:12] whole medley of of things that he's
[38:14] saying and it's a continual flow of what
[38:16] Jesus is prophesying
[38:19] uh concerning what's going to happen in
[38:21] the ages, concerning what's going to
[38:24] happen at the beginning of the church,
[38:25] the middle of the church, and the end of
[38:27] the church. And he and so coming from
[38:32] Luke 17, we won't have to turn there
[38:34] because you're so familiar with it that
[38:37] as it was in the days of Noah, as it was
[38:41] in the days of Lot, so shall it be in
[38:44] the coming of the son of man. Right
[38:48] &gt;&gt; now,
[38:49] continuing on in his here's his here's
[38:52] the rest of his sermon notes.
[38:55] Luke 2:15.
[38:57] And some spake of the temple, how it was
[39:00] adorned with goodly stones and gifts.
[39:04] He said,
[39:06] "As for these things which ye behold,
[39:09] the days will come in which there shall
[39:12] not be left one stone upon another that
[39:15] shall not be thrown down." and referring
[39:17] to a coming prophecy when Titus would
[39:20] surround the city, besiege the city, all
[39:23] the Christians would escape
[39:26] and and the the temple they were so
[39:28] proud of would be thrown down. Not even
[39:30] a stone left. You see the whailing wall?
[39:32] That's because they re reerected that.
[39:35] See it? There was not one stone left.
[39:37] So,
[39:39] so he goes on, "And they asked him
[39:41] saying verse 7, master, when shall these
[39:45] things be?
[39:46] And what sign will there be when these
[39:50] things shall come to pass?" So you're
[39:53] you remember when you read that from
[39:56] Matthew's gospel and I rather suppose
[39:58] it's why brother Brandham used Matthew
[40:01] is because Luke only presents it as two
[40:03] questions where Matthew sees the nuance
[40:06] and there's actually it's three
[40:07] questions and and brother Brandham says
[40:10] you've got to make sure you understand
[40:12] he's answering three questions. What
[40:14] will be the sign of thy coming? See what
[40:17] will when will these things be? What
[40:19] will be the sign of thy coming? comma
[40:22] and of the end of the world. And if you
[40:25] don't capture that, then it just it just
[40:28] sounds like Jesus is just saying
[40:29] everything about one event. He's
[40:31] actually teaching what's going to happen
[40:33] over 2,000 years. Only no one knew that.
[40:37] It's going to happen over seven
[40:38] contiguous ages. Only no one knew that.
[40:41] You see, even when John comes back with
[40:44] the book of Revelation, the mystery is
[40:46] sealed up. And no one understands that
[40:48] it the the church is going to go into
[40:50] the ground and it's going to go into
[40:51] darkness. It's going to be a thousand
[40:52] years of just darkness
[40:55] called the dark ages. And then he'll
[40:57] begin. Oh, so then the rapture comes
[40:59] after that. No, he's got to first come
[41:01] and start with justification. And that's
[41:03] going to run for hundreds of years.
[41:04] Hundreds. Yeah. And then hundreds after
[41:06] that, a sanctification's going to come
[41:08] on the scene. My goodness. When are we
[41:09] getting out of here? Well, after that,
[41:11] there's got to be a restoration of some
[41:13] power. The church is missing. Okay. then
[41:15] that power is going to take us home. No,
[41:16] that won't even be the full message.
[41:19] It'll there'll be a an end time gentile
[41:21] prophet who will come and bring the
[41:22] opening of the of the word. Okay, then
[41:25] we can go home. Well, that prophet
[41:26] thought that.
[41:28] &gt;&gt; People who followed him thought that.
[41:30] Here we are almost seven decades later.
[41:34] I'll be honest with you. I I I already
[41:38] expected that we would be several
[41:40] decades into into the millennium by now.
[41:43] Imagine that. Imagine if we were already
[41:46] several decades into the millennium
[41:48] thinking, "Oh my goodness, you remember
[41:50] back remember that day back in the day."
[41:53] But here we are still fighting the
[41:55] greatest battle ever fought, the one
[41:57] that spilled over out of heaven into the
[41:59] garden. It's still raging today.
[42:01] &gt;&gt; See? All right. So, so, so, so he says,
[42:05] and and then here in the seventh verse,
[42:07] he only breaks it into two questions.
[42:09] Luke doesn't quite catch the nuance of
[42:11] the third that it's three questions. At
[42:13] least if he caught it, he didn't write
[42:14] it as such. Verse eight, and he said,
[42:17] "Take heed that you be not deceived. For
[42:21] many shall come in my name, saying, I am
[42:23] Christ, and the time draweth near. Go ye
[42:27] not therefore after them.
[42:30] But when ye shall hear of wars and
[42:32] commotions, be not terrified, for these
[42:34] things must first come to pass. But the
[42:36] end is not by and by.
[42:39] Then said he unto them, "Nation shall
[42:42] rise against nation, and kingdom against
[42:45] kingdom." So that's going to go on all
[42:48] down through the church ages. You're not
[42:50] going to really get any anything to
[42:53] notice beyond nation rising against
[42:56] nation until you get to the to the woes
[43:00] &gt;&gt; at the end time. And now it's not just
[43:02] nation rising against nation. It's
[43:04] global war. It's never happened in the
[43:07] earth. And then the first wo is going to
[43:10] lead into the second woe. And that's
[43:12] even going to be a larger 50 nations.
[43:16] &gt;&gt; 100 million uh armed soldiers committed
[43:19] to that war. How many I think 50 million
[43:23] civilians died in that war. So it's
[43:25] global. So it's it's you know he he's
[43:28] saying you you'll hear these things wars
[43:31] and rumors of wars. Nations rise against
[43:33] nations. You don't understand it now,
[43:35] but this is going to go on for 2,000
[43:37] years. Uh but but but when you but
[43:41] remember what I said. When you see the
[43:44] days of Lot and Noah return
[43:45] simultaneously
[43:47] and you see that and Jesus would say in
[43:49] Matthew 24, when you see all these
[43:51] things, and brother Brandon would say
[43:54] all these other things, all these
[43:55] things, not just one sign. We don't
[43:57] cabbage down on one sign. It's all these
[44:00] things. See, then you know that it's at
[44:03] the door. Lift up your heads. Your
[44:05] redemption draweth nigh.
[44:07] &gt;&gt; Let's pray.
[44:09] Father, we thank you for your word
[44:12] today. And we're committing ourselves
[44:15] into your hands for service. Now,
[44:17] looking to you, the author and finisher
[44:19] of our faith. Commit it to you in Jesus
[44:22] name. Amen. God bless you, friends. You
[44:24] can be seated.
[44:41] So, um, Brother Mark, let's have my uh
[44:44] PowerPoint.
[44:49] Amen.
[44:51] So, future events becoming clear in
[44:54] prophecy. And I'm just going to be
[44:57] very uh studious to stick with my notes.
[45:00] I because I have a great bit to say and
[45:03] I I have an order that I want to say it
[45:04] in. I feel that is under the inspiration
[45:07] of the Holy Spirit. And don't we're not
[45:09] going to wear you out. So just hang on.
[45:11] Will you do it? Amen. Give me some
[45:13] undivided attention for a little bit.
[45:15] Amen. Try to not be Americans. I know
[45:17] you are, but try to try to try to not be
[45:20] too much of an American today. Poor
[45:22] thing. So
[45:24] Amen. So, brother Brandham would say
[45:28] here in questions and answers 1964.
[45:34] Now, this logos that was in him which
[45:39] was the spirit of God, the anointing
[45:42] through the sanctifying grace of the
[45:44] blood brought many sons to God which is
[45:47] anointed with this same logos. Isn't
[45:50] that a beautiful That's almost poetry.
[45:53] That same logos that was in him is in
[45:55] you. See? Amen.
[45:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:58] &gt;&gt; All right. Now, he he's going to begin
[46:01] to explain what now first he's in Jesus
[46:06] in his earthly ministry. But now he's
[46:09] going to exp he's going to start
[46:11] tackling the whole idea that Jesus said,
[46:14] "I go away, but I'm coming back and the
[46:17] world won't see me, but you'll see me
[46:18] because I'll be in you and you'll
[46:21] recognize my word moving in your midst.
[46:23] Although the world won't still won't, no
[46:26] more than they recognize me as I'm
[46:27] alive, they won't recognize me in you
[46:30] either."
[46:30] &gt;&gt; See, and they'll they'll say all manner
[46:33] of things Jesus warned them. They'll
[46:35] throw you in prison and kill you
[46:36] thinking they're doing God a service.
[46:38] Even Paul with all of his training uh
[46:41] started out like that. So it doesn't
[46:44] matter, you know, what kind of training
[46:46] you have, you you have to be inspirable
[46:49] to receive the inspiration of the Holy
[46:51] Spirit.
[46:52] &gt;&gt; All right? And God does that in his own
[46:54] timing. You would think, well, Paul got
[46:57] it because he had read the word. Paul
[46:59] had read the word since a child. See?
[47:02] And so, but he it still took the Holy
[47:04] Spirit to make it clear. This is why
[47:07] bibl Bible apologetics have never saved
[47:10] the world
[47:11] &gt;&gt; because you can explain the scriptures.
[47:14] But apologists argue with one another.
[47:16] So, this is why I love the reason this
[47:19] is why I love brother Brandham's
[47:21] sensible way of saying that God
[47:24] interprets his word by bringing it to
[47:26] pass.
[47:27] &gt;&gt; So, that puts an end to the argument.
[47:29] You cannot now you can still argue and
[47:31] people still argue that these signs do
[47:34] not follow the believer but yet they
[47:37] actually do
[47:38] &gt;&gt; and we're witnesses of it. But that
[47:40] still doesn't convince the gains.
[47:43] &gt;&gt; So do we go out and argue with them and
[47:45] and and and jostle with them and have a
[47:47] have a have a sword fight with them.
[47:49] There's no value in that because even if
[47:51] you could persuade them, someone else
[47:53] could dissuade them. They've got to have
[47:55] a revelation. So we preach the word.
[47:58] Amen.
[47:59] &gt;&gt; Paul said that will convince the
[48:01] gainser. If they can be convinced,
[48:03] that's what will do it. And if that
[48:05] won't do it, then there's nothing else
[48:07] that's going to do it. So, we stick with
[48:09] that. All right. So, now he's he's going
[48:13] to go from the from the days of Jesus,
[48:16] the logos living in him, and now he's
[48:18] going to go to the day of Pentecost
[48:20] where the logos began to live in his
[48:22] church. All right. Now on the day of
[48:24] Pentecost, it come down that pillar of
[48:27] fire and broke apart like that. And
[48:30] tongues of fire set upon each of them,
[48:32] not their tongue tongues, but tongues of
[48:35] fire set upon each of them a elected
[48:39] selected group identified. Catch it.
[48:42] They're identified by this pillar of
[48:44] fire showing that God had separated
[48:48] himself into man. Isn't that beautiful?
[48:52] God the logos separated himself into
[48:56] man. God not in one person. He's in his
[49:00] church. Universal. That's the reason
[49:03] Jesus said, "The works that I do shall
[49:06] you do also." Doesn't that make so much
[49:08] sense? Now, I know the King James says
[49:11] greater, but the right translation there
[49:14] is more than this shall you do. God was
[49:17] bottled and confined in one man, Jesus
[49:20] Christ. Later on, brother Brandon's
[49:22] going to come back around back to this
[49:24] statement and say, you know, I used to
[49:26] always believe it was just simply more.
[49:28] But he said it it occurred to me in the
[49:30] woods there that he did something even
[49:33] Jesus didn't do in his earthly ministry
[49:36] that he went all the way back to Genesis
[49:38] power and said, "Let there be." And he
[49:40] said, "Just say where it is." He said,
[49:42] "Let him let him come out and run out
[49:44] that limb and look at that farmer." And
[49:46] it happened.
[49:49] So I so you you have to acknowledge
[49:54] that we have arrived
[49:57] at a place in prophecy where prophecy is
[50:01] becoming clear in a way that it had not
[50:05] happened even in the ministry of Jesus
[50:08] or the early church
[50:10] &gt;&gt; where it's actually not just more but
[50:14] it's actually greater.
[50:16] &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen.
[50:18] &gt;&gt; In in a in a sense greater in a sense
[50:21] it's all God doing it.
[50:23] &gt;&gt; All right. So So now but but remember
[50:27] the pillar of fire
[50:30] was he couldn't even he's in the woods
[50:33] and he doesn't even see the pillar of
[50:35] fire and that troubles him.
[50:37] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[50:37] &gt;&gt; And he even says that on tape. He says
[50:40] he says I kept looking around. Normally
[50:42] I see that light.
[50:44] &gt;&gt; Yeah. And he said, 'I And I started and
[50:46] Brother Brandham gets beside himself.
[50:48] He's feeling like he's going insane. And
[50:50] he said, I said, ' Where are you? Who
[50:52] are you? What do you want?
[50:54] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen.
[50:55] &gt;&gt; You wouldn't think a man that had spent
[50:57] that many decades in the in that
[50:59] presence could have got so, you know,
[51:02] unscrewed like that.
[51:04] &gt;&gt; So, I'm here to tell you something,
[51:06] friends. Let me just say this that
[51:08] whatever is happening in the bride today
[51:12] and God working in your life, I promise
[51:14] you it'll be more than you understand or
[51:16] can comprehend. And you just have to
[51:18] say, Lord, be it unto me according to
[51:21] thy word.
[51:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:24] &gt;&gt; It it won't make all sense to you to say
[51:27] nothing of it making sense to the world.
[51:30] You're only going to become more odd.
[51:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:35] You're going to become so odd, so weird,
[51:37] so you're just going to vanish.
[51:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[51:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:42] &gt;&gt; And the last thing they know of you,
[51:44] where'd he go? I don't know. Dude was
[51:45] crazy. I don't even know where. No
[51:47] wonder. No telling where he's at now.
[51:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:51] &gt;&gt; Well, wherever I'll be, uh, I will be.
[51:56] &gt;&gt; I won't just be gone. I will be.
[52:00] I will still be thinking. Therefore, I
[52:01] will still be being.
[52:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:06] So now I know so he says here God was
[52:08] bottled and confined in one man Jesus
[52:12] Christ.
[52:13] Now he's going on. All right. So he says
[52:17] but now he's bottled and confined in the
[52:20] whole church the whole universal church
[52:23] of the living God. Then watch the works
[52:27] of it. Amen.
[52:28] &gt;&gt; It among us proves the same Jesus that
[52:33] once lived in Palestine,
[52:35] the same spirit was upon him has come up
[52:39] through a body until it's come back to
[52:43] headship again, which he's coming soon
[52:46] to claim that body. So the whole process
[52:49] of Pentecost and then that seed going to
[52:52] the ground and a thousand years of dark
[52:53] ages and the restoration of it coming
[52:55] back through four stages back to where
[52:57] the fruit is ripe in the type in the top
[52:59] of the tree ripening.
[53:02] See ripening for the body change because
[53:05] you don't you just because you grow
[53:08] wheat you you le let's use corn for a
[53:11] second. You can you can grow corn and
[53:14] you can get it back to seed and you can
[53:17] pull the ear off and it's eatable. It's
[53:20] consumable.
[53:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:21] &gt;&gt; But it's not plantable.
[53:24] &gt;&gt; It's got to it's got to be dried out.
[53:26] You can't just pull that eatable corn
[53:28] and squeeze it and juice pop you in the
[53:30] eye and then go put that in the ground.
[53:31] That won't do anything. It'll you'll it
[53:34] it won't germinate because it hasn't had
[53:36] enough time to to dry out. Wheat's the
[53:39] same way. It's still green. It's got to
[53:40] lay in the presence of the sun. See, so
[53:43] that's why the church had to go into the
[53:46] ground. People who say that early church
[53:51] didn't have the invisible union with
[53:53] Christ, didn't have the token, didn't
[53:55] have the abstract deed, weren't the
[53:57] perfect church. Well, then how were they
[53:59] planted?
[54:03] &gt;&gt; Because they went into the ground.
[54:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. And they and if and if they hadn't
[54:07] been plantable, they were consumable and
[54:10] God was using them. But if they hadn't
[54:12] been plantable, there would have been no
[54:14] resurrection of the seed coming back. It
[54:17] would have never germinated. See? So the
[54:20] very fact that that they were planted in
[54:22] the ground shows that God had them
[54:24] plantable.
[54:26] &gt;&gt; See, now you're coming back to you're
[54:30] coming back to being plantable. Only the
[54:34] modern event made clear of prophecy in
[54:36] this day which is you is not that you're
[54:39] going to be planted and another age
[54:41] coming. You're going to get a body
[54:42] change.
[54:44] &gt;&gt; You're going into a glorified state
[54:46] because you have reached once again that
[54:49] mature state. They couldn't receive that
[54:52] because the the names were still had to
[54:54] be filled up. They had to go into the
[54:56] ground.
[54:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:58] &gt;&gt; All right. I'm I'm ahead of myself, so I
[55:01] may repeat that in a little bit, but let
[55:04] me carry on. I promise the Lord I would
[55:06] just follow him today.
[55:09] So he says here,
[55:12] all right, 11:16, then watch the works
[55:15] of it because that identifies it. among
[55:17] us
[55:18] &gt;&gt; proves the same Jesus that once lived in
[55:21] Palestine.
[55:22] The same spirit was upon him has come up
[55:25] through the body until it's come back to
[55:28] headship again which he's coming soon to
[55:32] claim that body. Amen. The heads coming
[55:37] to the body. It's a spirit. Now, if you
[55:41] if you um if you go find these quotes,
[55:46] you're going to find that I'm taking
[55:48] some out and you'll see dot dot dot or
[55:50] or it'll be dot dot dot and it'll
[55:51] continue. That's just because I'm taking
[55:53] out extraneous stuff that that could
[55:55] break your thought. You can you I always
[55:57] say go back and hear the tape yourself,
[55:58] but but don't don't execute me because
[56:01] I'm doing that because I'm I'm just
[56:02] trying. Brother Brandon is actually
[56:04] running two thoughts at once and it gets
[56:05] a little confusing and I didn't want
[56:06] that to happen to you. So, I just got
[56:08] out the relevant points. I'm trying to
[56:10] teach today. Good. Everybody good?
[56:13] &gt;&gt; All right.
[56:14] So, amen. The head's coming to the body.
[56:19] It's in spirit form.
[56:21] which was upon the Son of Man, and has
[56:24] come now to anoint sons of man to bring
[56:28] back a ministry just exactly like he
[56:32] said it would be in order for the head
[56:35] and the rest of the body to connect
[56:38] together.
[56:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:42] &gt;&gt; All right,
[56:43] carry on.
[56:45] Just like
[56:47] the pyramid as Enoch built. And we find
[56:51] in that pyramid, they never did get the
[56:54] headstone on it. Why? The headstones yet
[56:57] to come. Those stones are laying in
[57:01] there so per um those stones are laying
[57:04] in there so perfect. And that top where
[57:06] the Koopa like in the top of it, when
[57:09] that stone comes, it'll be like a great
[57:13] diamond fitting right down in there just
[57:15] perfect with it. Now, this is events.
[57:18] These are modern events surrounding the
[57:21] rapture.
[57:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:23] &gt;&gt; But remember, the rapture is not just a
[57:26] calendar event. The rapture is a people.
[57:30] &gt;&gt; The resurrection is not just an event on
[57:33] a calendar. Jesus said, "I am the
[57:35] resurrection." So the resurrection is
[57:38] manifestation.
[57:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:41] &gt;&gt; See? All right. You're thinking with me?
[57:46] &gt;&gt; Carry on. You just hold on. Keep We're
[57:48] going to keep going.
[57:50] So he says, um,
[57:53] like a diamond fitting right down in
[57:56] there, just perfect with it. Now, watch
[58:00] this. Here's why he the rapture couldn't
[58:03] come in the ages or even at the end of
[58:07] the first age
[58:10] or even at the days when the church in
[58:12] those first couple decades was running
[58:13] perfect under the teaching of the
[58:15] apostles and prophets.
[58:18] Now that stone would not fit down there
[58:20] on the bottom foundation talking about
[58:22] the capstone.
[58:24] &gt;&gt; Neither will it fit on the second
[58:26] foundation or the third foundation.
[58:29] It'll only fit on the top foundation
[58:32] when the entire building has become
[58:35] fitted to the stone, not the stone to
[58:37] the building, the building to the stone.
[58:40] When he has heuned his church and and
[58:42] and and that's what's happening. That's
[58:44] what's happening in your life today. God
[58:46] is hewing you, getting you to fit him.
[58:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:54] &gt;&gt; All right.
[58:59] So he says um
[59:01] it'll only fit on the top foundation
[59:03] when the entire building has become
[59:06] fitted to the stone. And Jesus cannot
[59:11] come until the church, a body of
[59:14] believers and the ministry that he once
[59:18] left will have to be the same as it was
[59:21] then too. And then that brings them now
[59:25] he's going to go into Hebrews 11. them
[59:27] without us is not made perfect. Without
[59:29] us, they cannot be perfected without
[59:32] without us accomplishing our part. The
[59:35] the the dead in Christ that's been dead
[59:38] for hundreds of years cannot raise.
[59:41] &gt;&gt; Now, I want you to notice what he says
[59:43] here. Uh
[59:46] Jesus cannot come into that church, a
[59:48] body of believers in the ministry that
[59:50] he once left. All right? So, now
[59:53] you've got to have a body of believers.
[59:56] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[59:57] &gt;&gt; So when can he come? When the last name
[1:00:01] on the roll is full.
[1:00:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:05] &gt;&gt; But that's not all.
[1:00:07] &gt;&gt; It's all it's the it's the believers all
[1:00:09] of them and that ministry working. Say,
[1:00:13] well, so we got to wait for the last
[1:00:16] believer to get this kind of ministry. I
[1:00:18] don't think so. I think that ministry is
[1:00:20] working right now and we're trying to
[1:00:21] find the last believer. Amen.
[1:00:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:24] &gt;&gt; See, but the only point I'm wanting to
[1:00:27] make is is they've got to come together.
[1:00:31] &gt;&gt; So, the body of believers and the
[1:00:34] ministry that he once left and as a
[1:00:36] conjunction that he once left will have
[1:00:39] to be the same then as it was then too.
[1:00:41] And then that brings them without us is
[1:00:44] not made perfect. Paul said Hebrews 11,
[1:00:46] without us they cannot be perfected.
[1:00:48] They must have this ministry. This is
[1:00:52] the end time believers.
[1:00:54] &gt;&gt; They must have this ministry to raise up
[1:00:57] the Lutheran Wesley's and all of them
[1:01:00] down through their ages. When that come
[1:01:03] when that part of the where the eagles
[1:01:06] gathered, just as the carcass is, the
[1:01:09] eagles will be gathered. You remember in
[1:01:11] in a previous installment, we showed you
[1:01:15] that Jesus starts talking like he's he's
[1:01:18] he's going to go somewhere nobody can
[1:01:20] reach him.
[1:01:21] and and and one of the disciples say
[1:01:24] where Lord and Jesus says whethersoever
[1:01:27] the carcass is the eagles will be
[1:01:29] gathered. So he's not leaving to go to
[1:01:32] Alpha Centuri.
[1:01:33] &gt;&gt; He's not leaving to go beyond our reach.
[1:01:36] He he the word of God is mighty even in
[1:01:38] thy mouth. He'd be not far from any of
[1:01:40] us.
[1:01:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:41] &gt;&gt; You understand? He's gathered. We're
[1:01:43] gathered around the word. If you want to
[1:01:46] gather with him corporally, then gather
[1:01:49] around his corporal body, which is his
[1:01:51] word, not not ink on paper, but this
[1:01:55] word living these prophecies becoming
[1:01:58] flesh, so that you are the modern event
[1:02:01] made clear you are the word. And when
[1:02:04] that is happening in the last name, then
[1:02:06] can come Christ.
[1:02:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:09] &gt;&gt; To take a bride in a rapture. Amen.
[1:02:13] &gt;&gt; So,
[1:02:15] so it's when,
[1:02:18] so it's when this gospel that as we said
[1:02:21] to you that Jesus said, when the when
[1:02:25] the when the when the gospel of the son
[1:02:27] of man, when this gospel is preached
[1:02:31] into all the world, what gospel? Well,
[1:02:36] you're pretty hopeless if you're
[1:02:38] depending on 33,000 different versions
[1:02:41] of the gospel
[1:02:44] north of I heard the latest one I heard
[1:02:47] was maybe it's approaching 40,000
[1:02:49] uh organizations and and associations
[1:02:52] and independent groups of of Christian
[1:02:55] uh are are flooding the airwaves. The
[1:02:57] internet is filled with them.
[1:02:59] Everybody's got an opinion. Oh, and I
[1:03:02] and I did so did my said my heart is so
[1:03:05] good. The other day I was sitting there
[1:03:07] and I I was uh watching something
[1:03:09] concerning history. And when I when I
[1:03:11] did, I went to the next one and I and I
[1:03:13] had been hearing all these voices and I
[1:03:16] I I'm sorry. I don't even have the
[1:03:17] tolerance. And I just go pass, go pass,
[1:03:20] go pass. And all of a sudden, I come and
[1:03:22] it's Brother Jason and he's got this new
[1:03:24] format and it looks so clean and so
[1:03:26] fresh and he's just right there. And I
[1:03:28] thought, "Oh my goodness, there's the
[1:03:29] word right there. I hope everybody is
[1:03:32] seeing this one."
[1:03:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:34] &gt;&gt; And I'm pushing likes. Yes. Amen. Oh,
[1:03:37] hallelujah. I want to tell you
[1:03:39] something, friends, that we have not
[1:03:41] believed cunningly devised tales.
[1:03:44] &gt;&gt; We are coming to the rapture of the
[1:03:46] church of Jesus Christ. And the word
[1:03:48] that we've held for all these decades, I
[1:03:50] know we thought we would be decades deep
[1:03:52] in the millennium. We're only not
[1:03:54] because there's still names to be filled
[1:03:57] and there's still a dynamic power to
[1:03:59] grow among us.
[1:04:01] &gt;&gt; Not just arrive, but to grow something
[1:04:03] that's already here.
[1:04:06] &gt;&gt; So, I'm not waiting for another revival
[1:04:08] or another message or another messenger.
[1:04:11] &gt;&gt; We're looking for the coming of the
[1:04:12] Lord. Yes.
[1:04:16] &gt;&gt; It's hard to fathom that the coming of
[1:04:18] the Lord
[1:04:20] that the world has been waiting on for
[1:04:22] 2,000 years began in me and you.
[1:04:27] &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, no, but that's a diff."
[1:04:29] No, it's not a It's the exact coming.
[1:04:32] &gt;&gt; Shout, voice, trumpet.
[1:04:34] &gt;&gt; Right? See, because everybody has an
[1:04:37] idea that the coming of Christ is like,
[1:04:42] you know, a great golden escalator drops
[1:04:45] down and an angel steps out on a cloud,
[1:04:48] blows a trumpet, an escalator drops
[1:04:50] down, Jesus comes down and takes
[1:04:52] everybody home to heaven. That's a
[1:04:54] fantasy,
[1:04:55] &gt;&gt; right? Amen.
[1:04:56] &gt;&gt; Nobody's going to be You say, "Well,
[1:04:58] isn't the whole world going to see him?"
[1:04:59] They are, but they're not going to be
[1:05:01] happy. They're wailing because they see
[1:05:02] him.
[1:05:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. See, so we realize that the
[1:05:07] rapture has the cycle of the rapture is
[1:05:09] already well underway. And when I say I
[1:05:13] thought we'd be three or four decades
[1:05:14] deep into the millennium, I'm just
[1:05:16] simply saying I thought the cycle would
[1:05:17] have long ago had us there. But I know
[1:05:20] this, I'm still in the cycle.
[1:05:22] &gt;&gt; I'm still moving in that direction.
[1:05:26] &gt;&gt; And I'm not moving there because I'm can
[1:05:29] do it under my own power. I'm so great.
[1:05:31] It's just that he he prophesied it and
[1:05:34] he prophesied that it would be in flesh
[1:05:36] and I'm it and you're it.
[1:05:39] &gt;&gt; And not because I was good but because I
[1:05:41] have believed the report
[1:05:42] &gt;&gt; and when it came my way it began to
[1:05:44] speak to me.
[1:05:47] &gt;&gt; See?
[1:05:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:50] &gt;&gt; So when the ministry of the son of man
[1:05:53] has gone into all the world is a is a is
[1:05:57] a is a a higher understanding. Jesus is
[1:06:00] saying when this gospel the gospel you
[1:06:03] say so you say well what do you base
[1:06:05] that on well what was he when he says
[1:06:07] this gospel was the gospel doctrine the
[1:06:10] new testament had even been written yet
[1:06:12] so is Jesus just saying and I don't even
[1:06:15] know maybe it's u maybe brother JD would
[1:06:18] know I don't even know if those words
[1:06:20] when this gospel is preached is in all
[1:06:23] four gospels so if it's not then is he
[1:06:26] just saying we only need the gospel that
[1:06:28] it appears in or one or two others that
[1:06:30] it appears in. And I don't need the rest
[1:06:31] of the gospel. I don't need the acts. I
[1:06:32] don't need any of the letters. So that's
[1:06:35] ridiculous. So what he's talking about
[1:06:37] is a manifestation of the word. What is
[1:06:39] he? The word made flesh. He's a human,
[1:06:41] but yet he's a god man. And the and the
[1:06:44] logos which came out of God which led
[1:06:46] Israel is living inside of him and
[1:06:48] living through him. When that repeats at
[1:06:51] the end time, when a people stand on the
[1:06:54] earth at the end time after seven ages
[1:06:56] have completed and that gospel of the
[1:06:59] word made flesh lives in people again,
[1:07:02] that's the gospel he's referring to.
[1:07:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:06] &gt;&gt; There's no question we're talking about
[1:07:08] the end of the world. That's what he
[1:07:09] says. When this gospel is preached, then
[1:07:11] the end will come. So that he's
[1:07:13] certainly talking about the end time.
[1:07:17] So that's that's when the end will come.
[1:07:20] Why? Why will why will that be true?
[1:07:25] Because there would be no reason for it
[1:07:29] to continue.
[1:07:31] &gt;&gt; All the names making up the gentile
[1:07:34] bride will have been redeemed.
[1:07:37] Hallelujah. Recovered from Satan.
[1:07:40] Hallelujah. Free from the law of sin and
[1:07:43] death. Hallelujah. there be no need for
[1:07:46] it to keep going on into another age.
[1:07:49] The tribulation can ensue. Moses and
[1:07:51] Elijah can uh go forward to get
[1:07:54] Benjamin. You remember Benjamin who was
[1:07:57] born while Joseph was away while Joseph
[1:07:59] was away getting a gentile bride.
[1:08:01] Benjamin was born. So while Christ has
[1:08:04] been away getting married to a gentile
[1:08:06] bride, you know, just like Joseph took
[1:08:08] Azenath there. It's so amazing because
[1:08:11] he pulled her out of a heathen a heathen
[1:08:13] priest family. She came from a family of
[1:08:16] priesthood and they worshiped the son
[1:08:18] god. Hallelujah. And he she's going to
[1:08:20] marry a man who's going to show her who
[1:08:23] the real god is.
[1:08:25] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. Friends, I'm glad he
[1:08:27] took me out of out of cold formal
[1:08:30] heathen idolatry and has introduced me
[1:08:32] to the same pillar of fire.
[1:08:36] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord Jesus.
[1:08:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:08:39] Hallelujah is right.
[1:08:41] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[1:08:45] &gt;&gt; So the first church age
[1:08:47] going into the ground, it it served
[1:08:51] God's plan and it must need to have
[1:08:53] happened.
[1:08:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:56] I mean, friends,
[1:08:58] do we really imagine that he would let
[1:09:02] them go into the ground if he wasn't
[1:09:05] absolutely certain that his word could
[1:09:08] bring them back again? Oh my. Oh my. And
[1:09:12] then and then as if that but wait,
[1:09:15] there's more. And then he's going to
[1:09:16] hinge it all. The whole plan he's going
[1:09:19] to let them go into the ground through
[1:09:20] seven ages. It doesn't matter because in
[1:09:23] Luther's day, Wesley's day and Isuza day
[1:09:25] and at the end time, he's going to have
[1:09:26] a people that the gospel returns and
[1:09:29] there's going to be a people who believe
[1:09:30] the report and become the prophecy.
[1:09:34] &gt;&gt; See, so actually your complete faith in
[1:09:38] the word of this day is what's going to
[1:09:40] carry it out.
[1:09:42] &gt;&gt; Oh, sure.
[1:09:44] &gt;&gt; That's why brother Brandham would say,
[1:09:47] and I don't I didn't put these up on the
[1:09:49] slide. I only I finished with my slides,
[1:09:51] but let me just read you these two. I've
[1:09:53] read them before. I want to touch on
[1:09:55] them again.
[1:09:56] So, the the reason I'm reading them is
[1:09:59] is to make the point I just said. He let
[1:10:02] them go into the ground certain he could
[1:10:03] bring them back.
[1:10:05] &gt;&gt; See?
[1:10:07] Certain that it would that that and and
[1:10:09] he had no problem.
[1:10:12] He had no problem. He didn't take
[1:10:15] counsel with anybody. He never has to go
[1:10:18] back to the drawing board again.
[1:10:20] &gt;&gt; He had no hesitation at all to hinge the
[1:10:24] whole plan uh uh on his word perfecting
[1:10:28] your and my faith at the end time.
[1:10:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:32] &gt;&gt; I I know you say, "How how does that
[1:10:35] help me, brother Jason?" Well, it helps
[1:10:36] me because I know that my faith ain't
[1:10:39] going to get it done,
[1:10:40] &gt;&gt; but I know I'm living because of his
[1:10:42] faith. Amen.
[1:10:43] &gt;&gt; See, so your complete faith in the word
[1:10:46] of this day is what's going to carry
[1:10:49] that out. This is exactly why brother
[1:10:52] Brham could say could make this
[1:10:54] statement from uh 1963. What shall I do
[1:10:57] with Jesus called Christ? The dynamics
[1:10:59] of this church will be a refilling of
[1:11:03] the Holy Spirit that we have worked in a
[1:11:06] small measure while the headstone. Now
[1:11:09] you should be fully versed on the
[1:11:10] headstone. We just read the quotes.
[1:11:12] While the headstone is coming down to
[1:11:14] unite with the body, listen. But when
[1:11:18] that head, that's Christ and body,
[1:11:22] that's you, unites together, the full
[1:11:25] power of the Holy Ghost would raise her
[1:11:28] up just exactly like that. Even the dead
[1:11:32] that's been dead in Christ for hundreds
[1:11:35] of years will rise in the beauty of his
[1:11:38] holiness and take a flight to the skies.
[1:11:41] The dynamics is the Holy Spirit.
[1:11:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:45] &gt;&gt; So
[1:11:47] I'm not I'm not trying to go back and
[1:11:50] recreate an Isuza revival.
[1:11:53] I'm not trying to go that was a great
[1:11:55] revival. I'm not going to be limited to
[1:11:57] that
[1:11:58] &gt;&gt; any more than I'd be limited to the
[1:12:00] Welsh revival preceding it by about a
[1:12:03] year or two. Neither would I be any more
[1:12:05] uh agreed to be limited there than the
[1:12:08] Armenian revival that struck Russia a
[1:12:11] decade prior to the Welsh revival. It's
[1:12:14] all it's all the open door set up at the
[1:12:17] end of the sixth age which was a a
[1:12:20] beginning of the revelation of the deity
[1:12:22] of Jesus Christ and the Armenians caught
[1:12:23] it in Russia
[1:12:25] &gt;&gt; in the late 1800s
[1:12:27] and and the zar that they had actually
[1:12:29] promoted it when his son came on. He
[1:12:31] crushed it and Nicholas completely
[1:12:32] crushed it. Completely uh nationalized
[1:12:35] all their churches and ended that
[1:12:36] revival and it jumped across the channel
[1:12:38] and landed and in in Welsh land and
[1:12:41] became and in Wales and became a Welsh
[1:12:43] revival and then lasted about a year and
[1:12:45] a half, two years, jumped over the pond
[1:12:48] landed in a at a zuna street and a
[1:12:50] little mission
[1:12:52] &gt;&gt; and shook the place.
[1:12:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:54] &gt;&gt; See, and it's all that that wasn't any
[1:12:58] greater than Wesley's. It was just a
[1:13:00] further part. It restored some power
[1:13:02] they didn't have. It was a little gr a
[1:13:04] little greater by that sense. A little
[1:13:06] greater in that same sense than than
[1:13:07] Luther. See, which Luther was a a
[1:13:10] millennial leap from the dark ages. So
[1:13:12] you understand it's God continually
[1:13:15] building towards something.
[1:13:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:20] So he says here, so so I'm not I'm not
[1:13:24] trying to recreate an Isuza or a Welsh
[1:13:28] or an Armenian revival, but I sure like
[1:13:31] what they found.
[1:13:33] &gt;&gt; I sure like having that in my recipe.
[1:13:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:37] &gt;&gt; What I'm looking for, Brother Brandham
[1:13:38] said, I he said, I'm not looking for
[1:13:40] another revival. I'm looking for the
[1:13:41] coming of the Lord. What brings the
[1:13:43] coming of the Lord, the opening of the
[1:13:44] seventh seal, the mystery of God
[1:13:46] revealed? Amen.
[1:13:47] &gt;&gt; It's a word revival that is packed full
[1:13:50] of justification, sanctification, and
[1:13:52] the power of the Holy Spirit.
[1:13:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:55] &gt;&gt; So, why would I avoid it? Why would I
[1:13:56] worry about it?
[1:13:59] &gt;&gt; It's all part of God's plan. It's all
[1:14:02] restoring back to bring the seed back to
[1:14:06] plantable stage again. Only this time,
[1:14:08] we don't get planted, we get raptured.
[1:14:11] &gt;&gt; Is this making sense to you friends?
[1:14:15] So this is why now brother Brandham he
[1:14:17] after he makes that statement
[1:14:20] the dynamics is the Holy Spirit that's
[1:14:23] uh November end of 1963 the headstone
[1:14:26] coming down to unite with the body when
[1:14:27] the head body unites together the full
[1:14:28] power of the Holy Ghost raise her up
[1:14:30] dead in Christ for hundreds of years
[1:14:31] will raise then he comes on about a year
[1:14:34] and a half later he's now in the uh not
[1:14:38] quite a year and a half he's almost he's
[1:14:40] coming to the spring of February 1965
[1:14:43] who is this Maze
[1:14:44] being eternal with him. Now, I've read
[1:14:46] this, but it's been way back in other
[1:14:48] ones, so I want to give you a fresh
[1:14:49] reading of it. You good?
[1:14:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:51] &gt;&gt; Oh, I got lots of time. You good?
[1:14:56] &gt;&gt; So, I hope you appreciate me going
[1:14:58] methodically slow
[1:15:00] &gt;&gt; and I'm just taking it point by point by
[1:15:02] point because I don't want you to get
[1:15:03] lost in the shuffle. When I hear to just
[1:15:06] shout, we don't even know what we're
[1:15:06] shouting about.
[1:15:08] &gt;&gt; Right. where where our enthusiasm is
[1:15:10] based on the word of God and that I see
[1:15:12] myself in it.
[1:15:14] &gt;&gt; You talking about make me shout. I want
[1:15:16] to shout and run.
[1:15:18] &gt;&gt; But I have a duty to stand here and keep
[1:15:19] preaching.
[1:15:23] &gt;&gt; Who is this Melzdc?
[1:15:25] Now you remember I've taught you when
[1:15:27] you go back and listen to who is this
[1:15:29] Melzdc? Just remember that that only
[1:15:33] about the first quarter, maybe a third,
[1:15:36] you could argue a third, but not more
[1:15:38] than a third of it, a quarter to a third
[1:15:40] of it, he's identifying who MelzDC was,
[1:15:43] that he was pre, he was he was God,
[1:15:47] &gt;&gt; in a human being
[1:15:49] &gt;&gt; and discerning the secrets of the heart.
[1:15:51] He's only doing that
[1:15:54] to show
[1:15:56] that his ministry is a replication of
[1:15:59] that
[1:16:00] &gt;&gt; because it discerns the secrets of the
[1:16:02] heart. And he's doing that to show
[1:16:05] Pentecost.
[1:16:07] Somewhat of a misnomer because Pentecost
[1:16:09] is not a denomination. Brother Random
[1:16:11] would constantly say that it's an
[1:16:12] experience.
[1:16:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:13] &gt;&gt; Although he used it, I'll use it. He
[1:16:15] used it. I get it. Uh but we understand
[1:16:17] the real Pentecost is the original. It's
[1:16:20] the jubilee.
[1:16:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:21] &gt;&gt; It's what gave them the abstract title
[1:16:23] in the upper room. Brother Brandham said
[1:16:25] they had the title. They needed the
[1:16:26] abstract, which was the spirit falling
[1:16:29] upon them. And again, as we were showing
[1:16:31] last time, only the paradox of God could
[1:16:34] come down and divide himself and not
[1:16:36] diminish himself in doing it.
[1:16:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:16:39] &gt;&gt; And that's paradoxical. How does he
[1:16:41] divide himself? But he doesn't become
[1:16:43] less. He doesn't become less at all. He
[1:16:45] becomes more.
[1:16:47] &gt;&gt; And that he divided himself. See,
[1:16:51] &gt;&gt; so he he's he's moving into his kingdom,
[1:16:54] which was always going to be the plan.
[1:16:55] That was always going to be the plan.
[1:16:58] That's why when God in the beginning and
[1:17:00] he created man in his image, he created
[1:17:02] his whole family.
[1:17:04] &gt;&gt; Brother Bram teaches that so clearly. He
[1:17:06] created his whole family. He's got his
[1:17:08] whole kingdom in his in his vision. Let
[1:17:09] us make man. You know, theologians argue
[1:17:13] over and they bring it down and they're
[1:17:14] trying to, you know, uh thread the eye
[1:17:17] of a needle. My goodness, you're missing
[1:17:19] the whole greater point.
[1:17:21] &gt;&gt; The whole thing is he's building a
[1:17:23] kingdom of kings and priests. He's got a
[1:17:25] civilization in his mind.
[1:17:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:17:28] &gt;&gt; And the whole fall is all going to serve
[1:17:30] and work according to his plan. He's
[1:17:33] going to bring it back anyway. He didn't
[1:17:35] He wasn't worried to let you be born in
[1:17:37] sin because he knew he could recover the
[1:17:39] seed in you. And if he recovers the seed
[1:17:42] in you, you go with the seed.
[1:17:46] So it's not the man that comes
[1:17:47] predestinated. It's the seed of God
[1:17:49] inside the man.
[1:17:50] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:17:51] &gt;&gt; That's the part that came from God and
[1:17:53] goes back to God and can't not can't not
[1:17:56] go back to God.
[1:18:02] &gt;&gt; So it says here
[1:18:05] and I I'm reading this quote to you
[1:18:06] again because I just want to get this
[1:18:07] one line. being eternal with him at the
[1:18:10] beginning.
[1:18:12] The eternal life that you had his
[1:18:13] thought of what you was
[1:18:16] only he wanted to
[1:18:19] he wanted me to stand in the pull pit
[1:18:21] say he wanted you to sit in the seat.
[1:18:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:25] &gt;&gt; Then we are serving his eternal purpose.
[1:18:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:31] &gt;&gt; Now I get it. We're just weak mortal
[1:18:34] humans. It didn't occur to us today when
[1:18:38] your feet hit the floor, oh my goodness,
[1:18:40] I got to get ready. I got to get kids
[1:18:42] ready. We got to get to church. We got
[1:18:43] to get breakfast. We got to get get out
[1:18:44] the rain. What are we going to do? Here
[1:18:46] comes an announcement. What? Do you
[1:18:47] understand that? The from the moment
[1:18:50] your feet hit the floor, you were
[1:18:52] walking in God's eternal purpose.
[1:18:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:54] &gt;&gt; All the while, while I was studying and
[1:18:56] preparing, I was preparing for his
[1:18:58] eternal purpose. See,
[1:19:01] &gt;&gt; you need to think like that because if
[1:19:03] you think like that, then the little
[1:19:05] trivial trials of this life won't mean
[1:19:07] all that much to you. Paul said,
[1:19:09] "Someday it'll become so real. This
[1:19:11] life, it won't even be worth mentioning.
[1:19:14] We worth talking about. The things that
[1:19:15] we weep and grind and cry and roll and
[1:19:17] throw dirt in the air and and and and
[1:19:20] want to die and it won't Paul said it
[1:19:22] won't even be worth talking about."
[1:19:24] &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:19:26] &gt;&gt; Said, "Someday on the other side you'll
[1:19:27] sit down under a tree. You'll think
[1:19:28] about stuff like that, you'll sit down
[1:19:30] under a tree and just laugh. I'm glad I
[1:19:33] get to laugh. I'm glad in all the pain,
[1:19:36] all the loss, and all the suffering, all
[1:19:37] the bewilderment, all the confusion, all
[1:19:39] the trials, one day I get to laugh.
[1:19:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:45] I'm glad to know there's no devil that
[1:19:47] can stop it.
[1:19:48] &gt;&gt; And and when I'm laughing, it won't be
[1:19:50] long after that he won't be
[1:19:56] &gt;&gt; being eternal with him. I keep starting
[1:19:57] again at the beginning the eternal life
[1:20:00] that you had his thought of what you was
[1:20:03] only he wanted you he wanted me to stand
[1:20:05] in the pull pit he wanted you to sit in
[1:20:07] the seat then we are serving his eternal
[1:20:10] purpose now here's the line and the one
[1:20:13] that left home
[1:20:15] &gt;&gt; only come to the earth to serve his
[1:20:18] purpose I want you just to remember that
[1:20:20] the one that left home see he's tapping
[1:20:24] into an eternal purpose this is so
[1:20:27] beyond is your car running right, is the
[1:20:29] light bill paid, is the groceries, the
[1:20:31] refrigerator full of food, you know, do
[1:20:33] I got friends? Do who guess who said
[1:20:35] what about me? You know, the whole
[1:20:37] purpose is an eternal purpose that just
[1:20:39] flies right over the top of all that
[1:20:41] stuff. And I realized that the one that
[1:20:44] left home. I'm going to read it like
[1:20:45] this. And when I left home,
[1:20:48] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[1:20:49] &gt;&gt; I only came here to the earth to serve
[1:20:52] his purpose.
[1:20:54] Brother Jason, who are you and why are
[1:20:56] you here? I'm an eternal being.
[1:20:58] &gt;&gt; If in case you didn't know, God bless
[1:21:00] you, Brother Jason Watkins. I'm an
[1:21:02] eternal being.
[1:21:03] &gt;&gt; I didn't start here. I'm not finishing
[1:21:04] here. I came from God. I'm going back to
[1:21:06] God. Why are you here? I'm only here to
[1:21:08] serve his purpose.
[1:21:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:10] &gt;&gt; You going to keep preaching to us if
[1:21:11] that serves his purpose?
[1:21:13] &gt;&gt; Can I be your friend if that serves his
[1:21:15] purpose?
[1:21:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:17] &gt;&gt; Will Will you have trials if that serves
[1:21:19] his purpose?
[1:21:20] &gt;&gt; Will he deliver you if it serves his
[1:21:22] purpose? Amen.
[1:21:24] &gt;&gt; What if he don't? Well, it'll serve his
[1:21:26] purpose.
[1:21:27] &gt;&gt; See, so I'm only here to serve his
[1:21:30] purpose.
[1:21:31] &gt;&gt; All right. Then after it's finished,
[1:21:35] it's brought back in a glorified state.
[1:21:39] It's matured and brought back again.
[1:21:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Is
[1:21:43] &gt;&gt; that beautiful? So last time, and I'm
[1:21:47] watching the clock. I'm coming up near
[1:21:49] the bottom of the hour if that clock is
[1:21:50] to be believed. Amen.
[1:21:55] Amen. Let me see. Oh, it's telling the
[1:21:58] truth. What's in church? It should be
[1:22:00] telling the truth.
[1:22:03] So, we finished last time with David's
[1:22:05] deep call to the deep,
[1:22:08] asking the Lord. And that that just
[1:22:10] meant so much to me to break it down
[1:22:12] like that. I had never read it like that
[1:22:14] with such a feeling in my heart that I
[1:22:17] that I could enter into David. David's
[1:22:19] my brother. And I was I was entering in
[1:22:22] to the desire, you know, he to to his
[1:22:24] great longing because remember David had
[1:22:25] come from a horrible failure. And he
[1:22:28] can't stay away from God. Isn't that a
[1:22:30] beautiful thing about being sons and
[1:22:32] daughters of God that you fail and then
[1:22:35] you repent?
[1:22:38] &gt;&gt; See, say, "Well, I'd rather not fail."
[1:22:40] Well, I don't think that that's going to
[1:22:42] be possible until you get a body change.
[1:22:45] But I'm glad I can repent.
[1:22:47] &gt;&gt; See? Yeah. uh you know the the the
[1:22:50] reunion is so wonderful to get to come
[1:22:53] back to God and and he's asking the Lord
[1:22:56] to create in him a clean heart and he's
[1:22:58] asking the Lord to renew a right spirit
[1:23:00] in him. David is he's asking he's asking
[1:23:04] God for a response.
[1:23:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:07] &gt;&gt; These aren't idol prayers.
[1:23:10] &gt;&gt; These aren't you know that's why brother
[1:23:11] Brandham said the Christian doesn't say
[1:23:13] prayers
[1:23:15] &gt;&gt; sometimes and I know what they mean. and
[1:23:17] they're innocent. And people say, "Hey,
[1:23:18] say a prayer for me." I'm like, "We we
[1:23:20] don't say prayers. I'll be happy to pray
[1:23:23] for you." Oh, yeah. You know what I
[1:23:24] mean. Yeah. I knew what you mean.
[1:23:27] Uh but but we pray prayers. We don't
[1:23:29] just say prayers. They're not rehearsed.
[1:23:32] Believe it or not, people's u 90% of
[1:23:35] their church service is is a script. And
[1:23:38] the priest will say this, that, and the
[1:23:39] other. And we're supposed to reply,
[1:23:40] "Okay, here it comes. Okay, there it is.
[1:23:42] Okay, my part is. And blessed be thou
[1:23:44] also." you know, and and the whole
[1:23:46] thing. And could you imagine that that
[1:23:48] after you'd meet me at the back door and
[1:23:50] I'd hand you a script today. Okay, now
[1:23:51] when I say this, you say that. And what
[1:23:53] happens after this? We all get to go
[1:23:54] home.
[1:23:57] Say, "Well, don't you want a response?"
[1:23:59] I do. Just say, "Amen."
[1:24:01] &gt;&gt; When I preach the word, just say, "Amen.
[1:24:02] I don't need you to read anything. Just
[1:24:04] go amen."
[1:24:07] &gt;&gt; But he's calling for a response from
[1:24:09] God. He's calling for a response from
[1:24:13] the deep that that great being. Haven't
[1:24:16] we all been there, friends,
[1:24:18] &gt;&gt; where we're anguishing and you're you're
[1:24:20] calling to God. You're you're calling to
[1:24:22] that great deep. A deep is calling a
[1:24:25] deep to respond. There is a deep to
[1:24:27] respond. And the deep here is calling
[1:24:29] for it to respond. That great fountain
[1:24:33] that fills all space and all eternity.
[1:24:37] And you know there there are there are
[1:24:39] things in life that can happen to us and
[1:24:43] and you know sometimes even just the
[1:24:45] comforting word of a friend
[1:24:48] &gt;&gt; can bring comfort.
[1:24:49] &gt;&gt; But you also are aware and sometimes
[1:24:52] we're painfully aware that sometimes I
[1:24:55] need more than just the comfort of a
[1:24:56] friend. I I'm calling there's a deep
[1:24:59] that needs more than that. I'm calling
[1:25:01] to the fountain. I'm calling to the
[1:25:03] deep. I need a response. Oh Lord. Amen.
[1:25:07] &gt;&gt; Sometimes I need him to tell me that
[1:25:09] everything's going to be okay. Sometimes
[1:25:12] I never I need him to tell me I'm not
[1:25:14] going to lose you. Don't worry. I'm not
[1:25:16] going to lose you.
[1:25:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I know what I'm doing. Just
[1:25:20] trust me. And that's all I need. I just
[1:25:22] need a response.
[1:25:25] &gt;&gt; Joy comes in the morning.
[1:25:26] &gt;&gt; G.
[1:25:28] &gt;&gt; It's like Ruth when I mean Ruth all all
[1:25:32] Ruth had was a promise from Boaz.
[1:25:34] &gt;&gt; Yeah. But that was enough. They Boaz had
[1:25:37] made her a promise. They had made a a
[1:25:40] covenant of love to each other. You can
[1:25:42] find that uh in the book of Ruth the
[1:25:44] third chapter. I might read that here in
[1:25:45] a minute. But but but Ruth comes now you
[1:25:49] know there in fact as I thought to
[1:25:51] myself that's exactly why brother
[1:25:53] Brandham said the vow marries you
[1:25:54] because that's that's what was
[1:25:56] happening. She went there and she
[1:25:58] uncovered his feet, which was a way of
[1:26:00] asking for asking that he would take her
[1:26:03] and marry her because she was a widow
[1:26:06] and she had no inheritance and but he
[1:26:08] was a near kinsman. But there was
[1:26:10] somebody nearer than him uh that had to
[1:26:13] be dealt with first and that represented
[1:26:15] the devil who had an inside track on
[1:26:18] you. See, and and but Jesus but you
[1:26:21] belonged to Jesus. So he came forth and
[1:26:24] he challenged the devil. you know, are
[1:26:26] are you able to take care of her? Are
[1:26:28] you able to bless her? Are you able to
[1:26:30] do for her like I want to do for her?
[1:26:31] No, I can't do that. I don't even want
[1:26:33] to do that. I hate her anyway. And I
[1:26:35] don't I don't want to do it. You can go
[1:26:37] ahead and have it. And Jesus said, "I'll
[1:26:38] take it." Hallelujah. And I was so glad
[1:26:41] on that morning he took me and he took
[1:26:43] you.
[1:26:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:26:48] &gt;&gt; See, Zion had been made a promise.
[1:26:50] Brother Brandham says, "Zion is always
[1:26:51] the bride." Uh, give me, brother Mark,
[1:26:54] give me Isaiah 62. We should probably
[1:26:56] read this together. Verses 1 to4.
[1:26:58] Brother Bradom shows us that Zion in the
[1:27:00] Bible, Isaiah 62:1-4,
[1:27:03] Zion in the Bible is always the bride.
[1:27:05] Watch this. For Zion's sake will I not
[1:27:09] hold my peace.
[1:27:11] &gt;&gt; And for Jerusalem's sake, see, so it's
[1:27:13] his people as well. I will not rest
[1:27:16] until the righteousness thereof go as a
[1:27:20] brightness and the salvation thereof as
[1:27:22] a lamp that burneth and the Gentiles
[1:27:25] shall see thy righteousness and all
[1:27:28] kings thy glory and thou shalt be called
[1:27:30] by a new name which the mouth of the
[1:27:33] Lord shall name. Thou shalt also be a
[1:27:36] crown of glory in the hand of thy Lord.
[1:27:39] What a promise friends. And a royal
[1:27:41] diadem in the hand of thy God. Thou
[1:27:44] shalt no more be termed forsaken.
[1:27:47] Neither shall thy land be termed
[1:27:48] desolate, but thou shalt be called
[1:27:51] Heepsah, and thy land Bulah, for the
[1:27:54] Lord delightth in thee, and thy land
[1:27:57] shall be married.
[1:28:00] &gt;&gt; Oh, you can have this world. Give me
[1:28:02] Jesus. You can have this world. I'll
[1:28:05] take the next one.
[1:28:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:10] &gt;&gt; So, he gives Ruth these great promises.
[1:28:12] Now daughter, I will surely do
[1:28:15] everything that you have asked. However,
[1:28:17] there's one nearer to you, and I must go
[1:28:19] deal with him at the court,
[1:28:21] &gt;&gt; and I'll go confront him, and if he
[1:28:22] won't take you, I'll take you, and I'll
[1:28:24] redeem you and Naomi, and I'll I'll
[1:28:26] redeem the whole family, and you won't
[1:28:28] any longer be called forsaken, and your
[1:28:30] whole land will be called married.
[1:28:32] &gt;&gt; Say, why am I going to be married? Yeah,
[1:28:35] I'm going to be married to the son of
[1:28:36] God. The whole land is called married.
[1:28:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. now. And he measures her out, you
[1:28:43] know, six measures of barley. She goes
[1:28:45] back and uh and and so so now but now
[1:28:51] Ruth is back home.
[1:28:56] She She's home from church now.
[1:28:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:59] &gt;&gt; Oh, she was rejoicing at church. She was
[1:29:02] laying there and he said, "Now slip out.
[1:29:04] Don't let anyone know you were here and
[1:29:06] and go and and I will surely keep this
[1:29:09] promise to you." and she left. And isn't
[1:29:12] it like that sometimes we come to the
[1:29:14] house of God, we get the we feel the
[1:29:16] most wonderful love. We feel the most
[1:29:18] wonderful assurance. He loves me. I'm a
[1:29:21] believer. It's going to be okay. And
[1:29:23] then you go home.
[1:29:25] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen.
[1:29:26] &gt;&gt; The trial's still there.
[1:29:27] &gt;&gt; And you're just hanging on a promise.
[1:29:31] &gt;&gt; They're apart now. It's dark. She's all
[1:29:35] alone.
[1:29:37] It was at that moment that Naomi stepped
[1:29:41] near with words that that were meant for
[1:29:46] us at the end time. They were said to
[1:29:48] Ruth. But you understand this why
[1:29:50] brother Brandham in the breach would go
[1:29:52] back to this story of Ruth and Boaz. Oh,
[1:29:55] because she's a gentile and he's he's a
[1:29:59] he's a he's royalty and he's going to
[1:30:01] bring her into the family of God and
[1:30:04] he's going to bring seed through her and
[1:30:06] then that child that she has from him,
[1:30:09] she will hand to Naomi and Naomi will
[1:30:12] bounce it on her. Look, I'm here to tell
[1:30:14] you something, friends. This gospel that
[1:30:15] you and I believe is going to go right
[1:30:17] to find Benjamin. It's going to go right
[1:30:19] to find those 144,000. Oh, I'm going to
[1:30:22] be at a marriage table. Hallelujah.
[1:30:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:30:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:26] &gt;&gt; And Naomi steps forward. These are words
[1:30:29] that comforted her cuz all she had was a
[1:30:32] promise.
[1:30:33] &gt;&gt; But now she's home from church. Now it's
[1:30:35] dark. Now she's alone. Now the battles
[1:30:38] of the mind. And here comes Naomi.
[1:30:42] Hear it, friends, because these are
[1:30:44] words for you. Sit still, my daughter,
[1:30:47] until thou know how the matter will
[1:30:49] fall. For the man will not be in rest
[1:30:53] until he hath finished the thing this
[1:30:56] day. Oh, why are we still here today?
[1:31:00] Why aren't we millennium uh decades into
[1:31:03] the millennium? Because he's finishing
[1:31:05] the thing. And after the work of
[1:31:08] redemption, watch this now. After the
[1:31:09] work of redemption, so Boaz took Ruth
[1:31:13] and she was his wife and he and this
[1:31:16] Ruth 4. and he went into unto her and
[1:31:19] the Lord gave her conception and she
[1:31:21] bore a son. It's incredible that you
[1:31:24] don't read about a wedding.
[1:31:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:27] &gt;&gt; You read about they're in the they're in
[1:31:29] the they're down in the threshing floor.
[1:31:32] She's back home. He's at court.
[1:31:34] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:31:35] &gt;&gt; And the next thing you know, Ruth is
[1:31:36] giving her a word of comfort to tie her
[1:31:39] over. And the next thing you know, he
[1:31:41] finishes and seals the deal. And then he
[1:31:43] takes her and the next thing you know,
[1:31:45] she's got a child. and the next thing
[1:31:46] you know she's his wife and there's no
[1:31:48] wedding at all because it's a portrait
[1:31:50] of the end time. We are we are married
[1:31:53] but it's an invisible union and the
[1:31:56] world doesn't see it but heaven sees it
[1:31:58] because the Bible says the bride has
[1:32:00] made herself ready. The marriage of the
[1:32:03] lamb has come
[1:32:08] &gt;&gt; and this is where we are friends right
[1:32:10] there. Revelation 19. Let us be glad and
[1:32:14] rejoice and give honor to him. For the
[1:32:16] marriage of the Lamb is come, and his
[1:32:19] wife hath made herself ready, and to her
[1:32:21] was granted that she should be arrayed
[1:32:23] in fine linen, clean and white. For the
[1:32:26] fine linen is the righteousness of the
[1:32:28] saints. None of this wedding detail is
[1:32:31] mentioned in Ruth. It's all invisible.
[1:32:34] Doesn't even talk about it. And to her,
[1:32:36] and and he sth unto me, write, blessed
[1:32:39] are they which are called under the
[1:32:41] marriage supper of the Lamb. See, we're
[1:32:42] not going to the marriage supper to get
[1:32:45] married. We're married right here, right
[1:32:48] now. We're invisibly united, and we're
[1:32:50] taken to a wedding supper.
[1:32:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:32:54] &gt;&gt; Blessed are they which are called under
[1:32:56] the marriage supper of the Lamb. And he
[1:32:58] saith unto me, these are the true
[1:33:00] sayings of God. And I, watch this now.
[1:33:03] And I fell at his feet to worship him.
[1:33:07] This is his tour guide.
[1:33:08] &gt;&gt; Yeah. He's trying. It's like the third
[1:33:10] time he's tried to worship him and he
[1:33:12] keeps stopping him. He says, "No, no,
[1:33:14] no, no. Don't worship me. I'm just thy
[1:33:15] fellow servant. I'm one of the prophets.
[1:33:18] Worship God." Cuz any true prophet will
[1:33:20] redirect worship back to the one who
[1:33:22] deserves it.
[1:33:23] &gt;&gt; No true prophet will accept worship. He
[1:33:26] won't he won't he won't accept money,
[1:33:28] women, or popularity. He won't go for
[1:33:31] those st. He don't He won't He won't try
[1:33:33] to build universities and schools and
[1:33:35] colleges and the letters of 4 million
[1:33:37] and a hand never touches it. He's not
[1:33:39] worried about that thing. He's worried
[1:33:40] about getting the bride. He he's worried
[1:33:43] about sewing the seed of the word.
[1:33:49] &gt;&gt; So he says,
[1:33:51] so you can see we're at the end time
[1:33:53] now. These are the true sayings. I fell
[1:33:55] at his feet to worship him. He said unto
[1:33:56] me, see thou do it not. I am thy fellow
[1:33:59] servant and of thy brethren that have
[1:34:00] the testimony. Catch it now. That have
[1:34:03] the testimony of Jesus Christ.
[1:34:07] Worship God.
[1:34:09] &gt;&gt; You say, "Man,
[1:34:11] he's got the testimony of Jesus Christ."
[1:34:14] What a privileged man was the prophet of
[1:34:17] this hour. But hold on, wait, there's
[1:34:20] more.
[1:34:21] For the testimony of Jesus Christ is the
[1:34:25] spirit of prophecy.
[1:34:27] So you are this prophecy fulfilled. That
[1:34:33] is the testimony of Jesus Christ. You're
[1:34:37] the living word of God, the ministry of
[1:34:40] the son of man, the word made flesh.
[1:34:42] Again, you are the modern event made
[1:34:46] clear in prophecy. the testimony of
[1:34:50] Jesus Christ.
[1:34:54] &gt;&gt; See the Lord as I as I just turned the
[1:34:58] last corner head for home.
[1:35:00] The Lord responded to David
[1:35:04] and he granted his request. Solomon had
[1:35:08] the same deep deep calling to the deep.
[1:35:11] &gt;&gt; And the Lord responded to him. And he I
[1:35:14] will say to you today that he will
[1:35:15] always
[1:35:17] respond to an honest humble heart. For
[1:35:21] the Bible says he loves a contrite
[1:35:23] spirit. You just recognize that the Lord
[1:35:27] that we preach today is a we we you say,
[1:35:31] "What version of the gospel do you
[1:35:33] preach today?" We we preach the version
[1:35:36] that's the truth. That the Lord is
[1:35:39] holiness.
[1:35:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:41] &gt;&gt; That the Lord is righteousness.
[1:35:44] &gt;&gt; That the Lord is equity and fairness.
[1:35:46] He's the embodiment of it. He is he is
[1:35:50] he is not only indelibly holy, but he's
[1:35:53] empirically holy. It's provable. You can
[1:35:56] go back through history and you have
[1:35:58] empirical evidence. This is what he did.
[1:36:00] That's why brother Brandham said if you
[1:36:01] get in a spot, go back to where somebody
[1:36:04] had a similar thing and whatever they
[1:36:06] did to God to get them out, you do the
[1:36:08] same thing and him being Jesus Christ
[1:36:09] the same, he'll do the same for you and
[1:36:11] you'll have the same kind of victory.
[1:36:14] &gt;&gt; I I am empirical proof that he lives. He
[1:36:17] called me out of a world of sin and
[1:36:18] changed my whole nature.
[1:36:23] &gt;&gt; See,
[1:36:24] &gt;&gt; he's pure. He's honest.
[1:36:29] See the when you go back and you look at
[1:36:31] the original law,
[1:36:35] the law that God gave to Israel,
[1:36:38] it was written in stone.
[1:36:43] But
[1:36:45] stone couldn't bring forth life.
[1:36:48] Stone couldn't praise him.
[1:36:52] Stone couldn't worship him.
[1:36:56] stone could never give him the glory
[1:36:59] that he so deserved, so richly deserved.
[1:37:04] And so, 1600 years after the law, we
[1:37:08] found a new kind of heart beating in a
[1:37:11] manger of hay. You remember last time I
[1:37:13] told you the fact that he could be
[1:37:15] killed and went in the grave proved he
[1:37:18] was a man. But the fact that he that
[1:37:20] that body could raise itself back up
[1:37:23] under its own power proved he was more
[1:37:25] than a man.
[1:37:26] &gt;&gt; Oh yes.
[1:37:26] &gt;&gt; See,
[1:37:28] &gt;&gt; so this coming promise that we see, we
[1:37:31] we read it last time. We looked at
[1:37:33] Ezekiel's promise. We looked at David's
[1:37:35] promise. We looked at Isaiah's promise.
[1:37:37] All these very various promises. uh be-
[1:37:40] because he died
[1:37:43] because he lived and died and rose and
[1:37:48] lives today.
[1:37:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:52] &gt;&gt; Because because he lives, then I'm
[1:37:55] receiving a new kind of spirit. I don't
[1:37:58] want my own spirit. I want his spirit.
[1:38:02] &gt;&gt; I'm receiving the living spirit of the
[1:38:04] living God to live behind living skin.
[1:38:07] And that's what makes me a prophecy
[1:38:10] fulfilled at the end time because it's
[1:38:12] how do you know it's a prophecy of God?
[1:38:14] Cuz I couldn't do it.
[1:38:16] &gt;&gt; I couldn't produce it. But yet it's
[1:38:18] being produced and I had no way to make
[1:38:20] it happen. And all the king's horses and
[1:38:22] all the king's men could never have put
[1:38:24] me back together.
[1:38:26] &gt;&gt; But there was another power. I've got
[1:38:28] another spirit. I'm here to tell you.
[1:38:30] Yeah. I've got a I'm still born in a
[1:38:32] body. Even catch this now. Even though
[1:38:35] my body is engineered, engineers are
[1:38:38] impressive people.
[1:38:40] Even though my body, your body was
[1:38:43] engineered by God.
[1:38:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. But because that it's born in sin
[1:38:53] and you have memory, conscience,
[1:38:55] affection, imagination, all these
[1:38:57] different problems in your body, then
[1:39:00] you have so many points of failure
[1:39:03] &gt;&gt; along the chain. There's engineers know
[1:39:06] that when they design something, they
[1:39:07] try to eliminate they they try to
[1:39:10] identify the weak points where there
[1:39:11] could be a failure here. We need to
[1:39:13] redesign that and eliminate. I'm here to
[1:39:15] tell you something, friend. Yeah, I was
[1:39:17] born uh I I was born by by the promise
[1:39:20] of God. I my body was engineered. But
[1:39:24] the problem is I'm in fallen flesh and
[1:39:26] I've got problems in memories and
[1:39:28] reasonings and affections and
[1:39:29] imaginations and memories and all these
[1:39:31] things. And those things can really
[1:39:33] cause you trouble. But I'm glad to know
[1:39:35] that because he lives, I can live. And I
[1:39:38] got a spirit in me that though I'm
[1:39:40] broken and though I've got weak points,
[1:39:41] I got somebody who can do something
[1:39:43] about it
[1:39:45] &gt;&gt; because I couldn't do anything about it,
[1:39:47] but I know someone who can.
[1:39:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:39:53] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:39:54] &gt;&gt; So this is why David could say, the
[1:39:57] psalmist could say, I will praise thee
[1:40:00] for I am fearfully and wonderfully made.
[1:40:02] &gt;&gt; Oh yes. Marvelous are thy works, and
[1:40:06] that my soul knoweth right well. My soul
[1:40:08] knoweth it, but boy, my conscience and
[1:40:10] memory have a hard time believing I'm
[1:40:12] wonderfully made.
[1:40:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:14] &gt;&gt; I don't always feel so wonderfully made.
[1:40:18] &gt;&gt; But I know this. I gave my whole heart
[1:40:19] to the Lord.
[1:40:21] &gt;&gt; Yeah, I still got problems.
[1:40:26] &gt;&gt; Come on. We still got problems,
[1:40:29] &gt;&gt; but you're in contact with somebody who
[1:40:31] can do something about it, friends.
[1:40:34] &gt;&gt; I love that.
[1:40:36] &gt;&gt; See, so so that's what happened there at
[1:40:39] that church. They they entered in
[1:40:41] literally entered into the fellowship of
[1:40:44] the mystery. And you know, we were we
[1:40:46] were showing you last time they just
[1:40:49] because they entered into the mystery,
[1:40:50] the world didn't know who they were,
[1:40:52] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:40:53] Jesus was a mystery revealed but yet
[1:40:55] still a mystery.
[1:40:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:58] &gt;&gt; And and and you say, "Yeah, what's
[1:41:00] because he blinded him." Well, hold on.
[1:41:02] Yeah. If you're talking about his
[1:41:04] elected Israel, yeah, he did blind him
[1:41:07] on purpose. Otherwise, Brother Random
[1:41:09] said, "Those real true Hebrews would
[1:41:11] have known him." See, they would have
[1:41:14] recognized him, but he blinded them for
[1:41:15] your sake
[1:41:17] &gt;&gt; so that he could get you. And that's why
[1:41:18] Paul says, "Don't rejoice against the
[1:41:20] against the the the the one that the
[1:41:22] vine that got planted. You're just a
[1:41:24] wild you're you're a wild plant. You got
[1:41:26] grafted into this thing. Don't rejoice
[1:41:29] against Israel because of their hour of
[1:41:30] blindness. For all Israel shall be
[1:41:32] saved."
[1:41:33] &gt;&gt; See, God's got this. Oh my goodness.
[1:41:36] What a plan. What a plan. Let them do
[1:41:38] what they want to do. They can have this
[1:41:40] meeting and this conference and this at
[1:41:42] the White House or at the Kremlin or at
[1:41:44] the Vatican. They can do whatever they
[1:41:45] want. Go on down. Uh car carry right on.
[1:41:49] Listen to the pipe piper. Go down the
[1:41:51] primrose path. Carry on. But I'm
[1:41:53] ascending. I'm going up. I'm not going
[1:41:55] over a cliff. I am a I am an unfolding
[1:41:58] mystery. I don't know what say what's it
[1:42:00] all going to mean. I don't even know
[1:42:01] what my day holds tomorrow. But I know
[1:42:03] this. He's holding.
[1:42:05] &gt;&gt; He's the one who called me. He's the one
[1:42:07] who redeems me.
[1:42:12] &gt;&gt; But the world is not not keen to see
[1:42:14] that. And and as far as the other ones,
[1:42:17] they close their own eyes. According to
[1:42:19] the prophet, even Jesus said, their eyes
[1:42:22] they have closed.
[1:42:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:25] &gt;&gt; Lest they they see with their eyes and
[1:42:28] hear with their ears and and be
[1:42:30] converted and I should heal them. See,
[1:42:32] so once you close your eyes, he has no
[1:42:35] further obligation. Now, thank God, his
[1:42:37] love and mercy, I mean, if he was
[1:42:39] gracious to Paul for all those years,
[1:42:41] I'm glad he was gracious to me. I'm glad
[1:42:44] he didn't take my first no. He just kept
[1:42:46] coming.
[1:42:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:42:49] &gt;&gt; Oh, I'm telling you something, friends.
[1:42:51] He's a He's a wonderful God. He's worthy
[1:42:53] worthy of all of our service. God bless
[1:42:56] you today. That's as far as we'll go. I
[1:42:59] don't know if there'll be a part 11.
[1:43:00] I've got more material, but let's stand
[1:43:02] to our feet. Amen. I just feel like
[1:43:04] that's enough for today. Praise the
[1:43:07] Lord. Your your appetite should be your
[1:43:10] hunger should be assuaged at this point
[1:43:12] until Wednesday. Amen. Praise the Lord.
[1:43:15] By then you come in here famished. I
[1:43:18] need some more food. Amen. Praise the
[1:43:20] Lord. Brother, I'm going to have you do
[1:43:21] it, buddy. Where you at? Where you at,
[1:43:23] big dog? I want you to do that song for
[1:43:25] me again. Almost home.
[1:43:28] &gt;&gt; Are you glad to be almost home?
[1:43:30] &gt;&gt; Hey, do we have words to that, brother
[1:43:32] Mark? If we don't type fast, brother.
[1:43:35] Amen. We probably know it anyway. Amen.
[1:43:38] Brother Kenny, you can help him sing it
[1:43:39] and you can get the congregation going.
[1:43:42] Amen. Praise the Lord. I love this song.
[1:43:44] Almost home, brothers. It won't be long.
[1:43:48] Hallelujah.
[1:43:50] Hallelujah. Soon we'll be leaving.
[1:43:53] You love him. I love him with all my
[1:43:56] heart. Thank you for your kind and
[1:43:58] patient attention today. I think we went
[1:44:00] as far as we could. I think we went far
[1:44:01] enough. I think you really have grasped,
[1:44:04] you know, the the whole essence of of
[1:44:08] these two different series. Both of them
[1:44:10] were like, I don't know, 8 n 10 parts
[1:44:13] long each. And I dealt with all the past
[1:44:16] and showed us in prophecy where he the
[1:44:18] word had come to pass. And then I
[1:44:20] thought, you know, okay, we're not here
[1:44:23] to just be news reporters. Let's let's
[1:44:25] look forward. Let's see what's
[1:44:26] happening. Let's see what's going to
[1:44:28] come. You remember we read that um
[1:44:32] statement was it last time and I think
[1:44:34] the time before
[1:44:36] that Russian specialist he was himself
[1:44:39] uh one of the I think he was Ukrainian
[1:44:41] maybe or was he Bella Bellar Russian I
[1:44:43] can't remember and yeah I think he was
[1:44:46] but anyway he was saying how that this
[1:44:48] 80 years that we've had since the world
[1:44:50] war he said no that's a that's an
[1:44:52] anomaly it should have never went that
[1:44:54] long and he's talking about how that we
[1:44:56] we are now again at 1937.
[1:45:00] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:45:01] &gt;&gt; See, and it and and it was wasn't until
[1:45:04] I think uh 38 or 39 that they invaded
[1:45:07] Poland and and then because of the
[1:45:10] treaties, you know, then France has to
[1:45:11] say, "Okay, we're going to defend." And
[1:45:13] then they declare war on France, then
[1:45:14] England declares war on them, and then
[1:45:15] the next thing you know, then Italy's
[1:45:17] declaring, the US is sitting back till
[1:45:18] they get attacked. And then Japan's
[1:45:20] declaring war on us, we're declaring war
[1:45:22] on Germany and Japan. And I mean, the
[1:45:24] whole thing, you can't stop it. They
[1:45:26] think they're in control. They think all
[1:45:28] of their conferences and their UN's and
[1:45:30] their meetings and their summits are
[1:45:31] going to stop it. You can't stop the
[1:45:33] third woe.
[1:45:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:35] &gt;&gt; It's coming. And once the bride leaves,
[1:45:38] the Bible says, "Behold, the third woe
[1:45:40] cometh quickly." See? Amen. But we're
[1:45:43] almost home. Amen. Let's try to sing
[1:45:45] along. Amen. Go ahead, my brother. Help
[1:45:47] us, brother Kenny.
[1:45:49] &gt;&gt; Are you disappointed?
[1:45:54] &gt;&gt; Are you desperate for help?
[1:45:57] [Music]
[1:45:59] You know what it's like to be tired and
[1:46:03] only a shell of yourself.
[1:46:07] Wow. Ain't that so true?
[1:46:08] &gt;&gt; You start to believe.
[1:46:11] &gt;&gt; Listen to these words now.
[1:46:13] &gt;&gt; You don't have what it takes. Oh my. How
[1:46:17] many times has he told us that?
[1:46:19] &gt;&gt; Cuz it's all you can do just to move,
[1:46:22] much less finish race. Can we be honest
[1:46:26] today?
[1:46:29] &gt;&gt; But don't forget,
[1:46:32] &gt;&gt; don't forget
[1:46:33] what lies upon.
[1:46:37] [Applause]
[1:46:41] Hallelujah.
[1:46:43] It won't be long. Soon your presence
[1:46:51] will be your
[1:46:57] God with all your strength. Sister
[1:47:07] of your hand. Keep keep pressing. Keep
[1:47:11] pressing.
[1:47:13] &gt;&gt; Beth tabernacle. Keep pressing. We're
[1:47:17] almost home. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Oh
[1:47:20] my. This road will be hard.
[1:47:25] You win in the end.
[1:47:30] Simply because of Jesus in us. It's not
[1:47:35] if.
[1:47:38] Oh my. Not if I take joy in the journey.
[1:47:42] Hallelujah.
[1:47:44] Then when it feels long.
[1:47:50] Oh, find strength in each step. Know in
[1:47:53] heaven. Christ cheering you on. They're
[1:47:56] cheering you on. Can you hear us? We are
[1:48:02] home.
[1:48:04] It won't be

[1:48:47] We're almost home. Almost home.
[1:48:56] I know that the cross has brought heaven
[1:49:00] to us, right? But make no mistakes,
[1:49:04] there's still more to come when our
[1:49:06] flesh and our no longer between where we
[1:49:11] are right now. Where we're meant to be.

[1:49:30] This our second way
[1:49:34] almost

[1:50:46] a song of your choosing. Bow your heads
[1:50:47] with me over the audience.
[1:50:50] Lord, what a grand day it's been to be
[1:50:52] in your presence.
[1:50:54] What a grand word that you've given us
[1:50:56] today. You fed your children well, Lord.
[1:50:58] We're grateful. Now, Father, take us
[1:51:01] under your care. Take us as we go out
[1:51:04] throughout the day, Lord. There's some,
[1:51:06] Lord, that we are in prayer for, we know
[1:51:09] are out of town and different ones and
[1:51:11] ministers from our team ministering
[1:51:14] away.
[1:51:15] Lord, I'm praying for your great grace
[1:51:18] upon all of our lives that you would be
[1:51:22] to us that sustaining portion that we
[1:51:25] need. Lord, we love you for the truth
[1:51:27] that's in your word today. And it gives
[1:51:29] us confidence to know that we can go
[1:51:32] forward and that you will be our stay.
[1:51:35] Commit our lives into your hands. Amen.
[1:51:38] Friends, I want to read to you real
[1:51:40] quick. I forgot to read it at the
[1:51:41] beginning. I got it from Sister
[1:51:42] Meredith. Amen. And I hope it'll come up
[1:51:45] here. Amen. It will in just in a minute.
[1:51:51] Wait for it to refresh. Oh, here we go.
[1:51:54] Um, Brother Jason, I have a testimony
[1:51:57] and prayer request.
[1:51:59] Kevin Renfro that we requested prayer
[1:52:02] for on Wednesday for his open heart
[1:52:04] surgery is doing well and recovering in
[1:52:06] the hospital. Thank you all for praying
[1:52:10] and continue to remember him as he
[1:52:12] recovers. Will you do it? And don't
[1:52:14] forget the uh lady that Sister Debbie
[1:52:16] and I prayed for, Tara. Her name is
[1:52:18] Tara. Be praying the Holy Spirit will
[1:52:21] heal her and reveal himself to her. She
[1:52:23] says, "Sister Meredith says, "I'm also
[1:52:25] asking the church to pray for my brother
[1:52:26] Michael. It has been about 2 months now
[1:52:29] since his heart valve replacement
[1:52:30] surgery. He's doing good, but has been
[1:52:32] discouraged that he's not making much
[1:52:34] progress as he feels he should. He has
[1:52:37] an appointment with his cardiologist on
[1:52:38] Thursday, which I think they are going
[1:52:41] to check to see if his heart function
[1:52:43] has improved. I'm asking that the church
[1:52:46] pray that the cardiologist tells him
[1:52:47] that he's making very good progress and
[1:52:49] that they see an improvement in his
[1:52:51] heart function. He really needs to hear
[1:52:54] a good report from them. Will you be
[1:52:56] remembering that today just before we
[1:52:58] leave the building under praise and
[1:53:00] worship? Will you remember that? Thank
[1:53:02] God for what he's done for uh Kevin
[1:53:05] Renfro and we're asking for her brother
[1:53:07] Michael. Amen. And all the different
[1:53:09] ones. What you gonna sing, Brother
[1:53:10] Kenny?
[1:53:12] &gt;&gt; I
[1:53:15] want to be ready.

[1:53:42] [Music]
[1:53:45] I want to be ready.
[1:53:49] Lord,
[1:53:52] I want to be ready to go. Yes, I know.
[1:53:59] &gt;&gt; I don't know how long I'll be here.
[1:54:04] &gt;&gt; But Jesus said
[1:54:05] &gt;&gt; Jesus said
[1:54:06] &gt;&gt; he would come again. That he'd come
[1:54:09] again.
[1:54:12] And when he come,
[1:54:15] I will go with him.
[1:54:20] When I hear
[1:54:23] him call my name,
[1:54:27] Lord, I
[1:54:31] want to be ready. God bless your saint.
[1:54:35] You can be dismissed.
[1:54:38] I I want to be ready to go.
[1:54:43] Lord, I
[1:54:46] want to be ready.
[1:54:50] Lord, I
[1:54:54] I want to be ready to go. Where can I
[1:54:59] be?

[1:55:09] when it all will take place.
[1:55:11] [Music]
[1:55:13] But when it does,
[1:55:16] it does not matter
[1:55:21] if I'm walking
[1:55:25] in his grave.
[1:55:28] Lord,
[1:55:32] I'm going to be ready.
