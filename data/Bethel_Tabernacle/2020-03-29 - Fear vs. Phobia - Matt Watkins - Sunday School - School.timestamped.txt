[1:05] Exodus chapter 20 amen praise the Lord
[1:13] we'd like to dusty chair just for a few
[1:15] minutes on fear versus phobia fear
[1:19] versus phobia Exodus chapter 20 verse 1
[1:23] and God spake all these words saying I
[1:26] am THE LORD thy God which have brought
[1:28] thee out of the land of Egypt out of the
[1:31] house of bondage thou shall have no
[1:33] other gods before me thou shalt make
[1:36] unto thee thou shalt not make unto thee
[1:38] any graven image or any likeness of
[1:41] anything that is in heaven
[1:42] or that is in the earth beneath or that
[1:45] is in the water under the earth thou
[1:48] shalt not bow thyself bow down thyself
[1:51] to them nor serve them for I the LORD
[1:54] thy God am a jealous God visiting the
[1:57] iniquity of the father's upon the
[1:59] children unto the third and fourth
[2:01] generation of them that hate me verse
[2:04] seven thou shalt not take the name of
[2:06] the LORD thy God in vain for the Lord
[2:09] will not hold him guiltless that taketh
[2:11] his name in vain verse 12 honor thy
[2:17] father and mother that thy days may be
[2:18] long upon the land which the LORD thy
[2:20] God giveth thee thou shalt not kill thou
[2:24] shalt not commit adultery thou shalt not
[2:26] steal thou shalt not bear false witness
[2:29] against thy neighbor thou shalt not
[2:32] covet thy neighbor's house thou shalt
[2:34] not covet thy neighbor's wife nor his
[2:36] manservant nor his maidservant nor his
[2:39] ox nor his ass nor anything that is thy
[2:42] neighbor's and all the people saw the
[2:45] thunderings and the Lightning's and the
[2:48] noise of the trumpet and the mountain
[2:51] smoking and when the people saw it they
[2:53] removed and stood afar off and they said
[2:56] unto Moses speak
[2:58] now with us and we will hear but let not
[3:01] God speak with us lest we die and Moses
[3:05] said unto the people fear not for God is
[3:08] not for God has come to prove which
[3:11] means to test you and that his fear may
[3:14] be before your face is that you sin not
[3:17] you can be seated this morning we like
[3:20] to just look here in contrast that with
[3:22] Hebrews chapter 12 if you want to turn
[3:24] there Hebrews chapter chapter 12 and
[3:26] verse 18 God gives these Ten
[3:29] Commandments and it's amazing because
[3:31] the Bible says that after they heard the
[3:34] thundering and they heard the lightening
[3:36] they seen the smoke the mountain on fire
[3:38] that the Bible says that the people step
[3:41] back they they removed themself that
[3:43] means they stepped away and they said
[3:45] this is you know Moses you can speak to
[3:48] us but we don't ever want to we don't
[3:49] want to have that happen again we're
[3:51] afraid of that and Moses says to fear
[3:53] not it's an important verse there in
[3:55] verse 20 it says Moses said unto them
[3:58] fear not for God has come to prove you
[4:01] to test you and notice that his fear so
[4:05] there's a certain fear that you don't
[4:07] fear and then there's a certain fear
[4:09] that you do fear there's there's a
[4:11] certain fear that is healthy and a
[4:13] certain fear that is unhealthy let's
[4:16] contrast this with Hebrews chapter 12
[4:18] verse 18 for you are not come Gloria I'm
[4:22] glad for this promise for you or not
[4:23] come unto the mount that might be
[4:26] touched and that burned with fire nor
[4:28] unto blackness and darkness and Tempest
[4:31] and the sound of a trumpet and the voice
[4:33] of words which voice they that heard and
[4:37] treated that the word should not be
[4:38] spoken to them any more for they could
[4:42] not endure that which was commanded and
[4:44] if so much as a beast touch the mountain
[4:47] it shall be stoned or thrust through
[4:50] with a dart and so terrible was this
[4:53] sight that Moses said I exceedingly fear
[4:57] and quake but you are come unto Mount
[5:00] Zion and unto the city of the Living God
[5:02] the heavenly Jerusalem and to an
[5:05] innumerable company of angels to the
[5:08] General Assembly and Church of the
[5:10] firstborn
[5:11] which are written in heaven and to God
[5:14] the judge of all and to the spirits of
[5:16] just men made perfect and to Jesus the
[5:20] mediator of the New Covenant and to the
[5:23] blood of sprinkling that speaketh better
[5:25] things than that of Abel see that you
[5:28] refer you refuse not him that speaketh
[5:31] for if they if for if they scape not who
[5:34] refused him that spake on earth much
[5:37] more shall we not escape if we turn away
[5:39] from him that speaketh from heaven whose
[5:42] voice then shook the earth but now he
[5:46] hath promised saying yet once more I
[5:49] shake not the Earth only but also heaven
[5:51] and this word yet once more signifies
[5:54] the removing of those things that are
[5:56] shaken as of things that are made that
[5:59] those things which cannot be shaken may
[6:01] remain wherefore we receiving a kingdom
[6:05] which cannot be moved let us have grace
[6:08] whereby we may serve God except ibly
[6:11] with reverence and godly fear for our
[6:15] God is a consuming fire the world that
[6:20] we see today is a world that is living
[6:23] in a in a constant state of fear and not
[6:27] just recently we're seeing we're seeing
[6:30] it come to a maybe a level that we've
[6:33] never seen before but prior to this
[6:36] coronavirus there was an atmosphere of
[6:39] fear man has been constantly falling and
[6:42] to further into a state of fear and fear
[6:46] meaning panic or fear
[6:47] meaning terror and that's a that's a
[6:50] word there that speaks of a of a fear
[6:53] that falls upon you that you that it's a
[6:56] it's a spirit of fear so we know that
[6:58] Jesus even himself predicted that the
[7:01] last days that we live in would be a day
[7:04] that would be full of fear unprecedented
[7:07] fear that he would speak specifically
[7:09] concerning the last days and he said it
[7:12] would be unprecedented fear and I think
[7:15] we're seeing the fulfillment of that
[7:16] right now
[7:17] even if you read the words in Luke
[7:19] chapter 21 verse 25
[7:21] Jesus says upon the earth distress of
[7:24] Nations with
[7:25] perplexity the sea and I think that word
[7:28] perplexity is what you could use to
[7:30] describe the leaders of the entire world
[7:33] today they are on their faces they are
[7:36] perplexed
[7:37] they are perplexed and he says with
[7:40] perplexity deceive the sea and the waves
[7:43] roaring men's hearts failing them for
[7:46] fear and looking after those things
[7:49] which are coming on the earth for the
[7:51] powers of heaven shall be shaken even in
[7:55] Matthew chapter 24 you get even stronger
[7:58] language or more specific when Jesus
[8:00] says nation shall rise against nation
[8:02] and Kingdom against Kingdom and there
[8:05] shall be famines and pestilences and
[8:08] earthquakes and all these things Jesus
[8:12] says are the beginning of Sorrows so we
[8:15] know that this would be speaking would
[8:17] be speaking specifically of the
[8:19] tribulation period period but he says
[8:22] all these are the beginning of Sorrows
[8:23] men shall betray one another and shall
[8:26] hate one another many false prophets
[8:29] prophets shall arise and shall deceive
[8:32] many
[8:33] he says iniquity shall abound and the
[8:36] love of many shall wax cold these are
[8:38] just some indicators of the end time
[8:40] then shall be Great Tribulation such as
[8:44] was not since the beginning of the world
[8:46] to this time no nor ever shall be for
[8:49] thou for there shall arise false Christ
[8:52] which we know is false anointed ones
[8:54] false Christ's and false prophets and
[8:57] shall show great signs and wonders and
[8:59] then he says watch therefore for you
[9:01] know not what hour your Lord doth come
[9:06] you take the entire world today both the
[9:09] the believers and the non-believers both
[9:11] the the saved and the unsaved and I
[9:14] believe what we're witnessing together
[9:16] though our reaction is different than
[9:19] theirs what we're witnessing is the
[9:21] birth pains of the end time we're seeing
[9:24] just the contractions of the world of
[9:27] nature as the Bible says that that all
[9:30] nature doth travail and groan and pain
[9:32] waiting to be delivered waiting for the
[9:34] manifestation of the sons of God waiting
[9:37] for the new head
[9:38] and the new earth and so I believe we're
[9:41] witnessing the birth pains now we're
[9:43] worse we witnessed that though our
[9:45] reaction is different than theirs as God
[9:49] commanded the children of Israel and
[9:50] said don't fear what they fear no it
[9:53] doesn't mean that we don't have fear
[9:55] doesn't mean that we are not susceptible
[9:57] to be an afraid or having a fear or
[10:00] phobia but the by Jesus Jesus picks this
[10:03] up and say or I'm sorry the the in in
[10:06] the Old Testament the the the Bible says
[10:08] don't he tells the children of Israel
[10:10] thou shall not fear it was not a
[10:13] suggestion this was a command that God
[10:15] was commanding them don't fear so we see
[10:19] that even today there's a terrible cloud
[10:21] we're witnessing of fear and distress
[10:24] perplexity there's a feeling you know
[10:27] that it's amazing because people are
[10:31] looking at this that you know we were in
[10:33] such good times before and you can you
[10:36] can look just at a law of contrast and
[10:38] see how that man looks at what we had
[10:41] before coronavirus was good and it
[10:43] really wasn't good it really wasn't good
[10:46] now in comparison to today were they
[10:48] your quarantine at home you can't go
[10:51] anywhere you're afraid even to go to
[10:52] Walmart of the girl or to to McDonald's
[10:54] but but it wasn't good before the
[10:57] coronavirus it was a world that was
[10:59] falling apart you can take time just to
[11:02] list some of the some of the just the
[11:05] shaking our that we were living living
[11:07] in even before this coronavirus broke
[11:10] out and America just cannot fathom the
[11:14] idea they there they're under such a
[11:18] spirit of Lady hacia of people's rights
[11:21] they just cannot fathom a world in which
[11:24] good times are over and and and and they
[11:28] would have to actually do without it
[11:31] they would have to sacrifice now of
[11:34] obviously were you know were the we're
[11:37] nowhere near the worst you know as the
[11:40] best Jesus says this is just the
[11:41] beginning of Sorrows nowhere near the
[11:43] worst but there's been at you look at
[11:45] even in before this there's been just an
[11:48] incredible amount of worldwide
[11:52] a Matisse whether you look at weather
[11:54] the weather and the the earthquakes that
[11:56] are striking the - the tornadoes the
[11:59] hurricanes you know the world all all
[12:04] brother man have said all nature runs in
[12:06] continuity and so all the world's
[12:09] systems in what you know whether you
[12:11] take whether you take you take economic
[12:14] life social life political life
[12:17] it all is running together towards an
[12:20] inevitable end Jesus spoke of this in
[12:24] its tragic
[12:26] you see tragedy after tragedy in the
[12:28] last just number of years we've seen an
[12:31] incredible X to me what would be an
[12:33] incredible acceleration towards
[12:36] destruction more than that more than
[12:38] ever before more than ever before we see
[12:42] an acceleration towards disaster you
[12:44] look at the Hurricanes we've had over
[12:46] just the last few number of years look
[12:48] at the winds of war that are blowing
[12:50] before coronavirus there was fear of war
[12:54] with North Korea then after that it was
[12:56] fear of of war with with Syria and so
[13:00] you know we cannot we can't I don't
[13:03] understand everything
[13:04] I don't think all any of us do and I
[13:06] don't think the Lord even wants us to
[13:07] understand everything we don't have all
[13:09] the answers no no I want to pretend that
[13:11] I do because I we don't know Jesus says
[13:15] you don't know the day or the hour that
[13:16] your Lord cometh but what we can see
[13:19] clearly is a pattern of accelerated
[13:23] destruction in the world will it get
[13:24] will it come back around and things will
[13:27] sort of get back to normal I believe it
[13:29] will I believe this is just another wind
[13:32] of chastisement that the Lord is sending
[13:35] he uses an agent we know that brother
[13:38] Branham says that God don't ever make
[13:39] anybody sick God doesn't send sickness
[13:41] he doesn't cause anybody to be sick
[13:44] he didn't afflict Joe but he gave
[13:46] permission to an agent of Satan to
[13:48] afflict Joe
[13:49] so God may approve some of these things
[13:51] but God's not the one enacting them this
[13:53] is Satan's Eden we're living in not
[13:55] God's and it is can rapidly it's rapidly
[13:59] decaying
[14:01] the world you live in is rapidly
[14:04] decaying
[14:05] and going into more of a pandemic of
[14:08] fear Ecclesiastes chapter 1 verse 18
[14:11] says in much wisdom is much grief and he
[14:14] that increaseth knowledge increaseth
[14:16] sorrow so man is continually to increase
[14:21] an e as he continues to eat from that
[14:24] tree of knowledge and good and evil what
[14:27] he thinks is bringing him health wealth
[14:29] and wisdom is actually bringing him
[14:31] sorrow and sadness and pain and the
[14:34] Bible says the more he increases the
[14:36] more sorrow so man is continuing to
[14:38] destroy himself as he eats from that
[14:41] tree fear is paralyzing it's paralyzed
[14:44] our economy it's paralyzed world
[14:46] governments but but beyond just this
[14:49] coronavirus fear there's the fear people
[14:52] there's a fear pandemic that has been
[14:54] going on for years and years and years
[14:56] and rapidly getting worse the fear of
[14:59] sickness the fear of disease the fear of
[15:01] losing your job the fear of you know
[15:04] cancer the fear of you know it's one
[15:06] it's one wave of fear after the next one
[15:10] after the next and as we said there's a
[15:12] healthy fear and an unhealthy fear you
[15:16] know we we teach our children to not you
[15:19] know go run out in front of traffic we
[15:21] teach them the fear of vehicles that's a
[15:23] good fear you know you teach the fear
[15:25] fire that's good to have a fear of fire
[15:27] because you don't want to get burnt and
[15:28] there are certain things that we teach
[15:30] our children to fear but then there's
[15:32] what we could call a phobia and a phobia
[15:35] is very different you just don't believe
[15:38] me you can go look up brother Wikipedia
[15:41] and he'll tell you that there's a list
[15:44] that science has has name just a a
[15:48] massive alphabetical order list of fears
[15:52] or phobias that come upon people the
[15:54] fear of darkness the fear of noise
[15:56] they've got a name for the fear of
[15:59] heights the the fear of aircraft for
[16:02] flying fear of open places fear of
[16:04] crossing streets fear of sharp or
[16:06] pointed objects fear of cats fear of
[16:08] pain fear of wind the fear of
[16:13] of isolation so we could list all these
[16:16] I just named you the ones in the
[16:17] alphabetical order of a that was just a
[16:21] you go to B and C and D and it just goes
[16:23] on and on and on it's a list of fears or
[16:28] phobias and those phobias lead to
[16:31] paralysis they lead to a person who just
[16:34] can't move or can't go forward but we
[16:37] could take and boil all of these fears
[16:39] every single one of them all of our
[16:42] fears all the fears of humanity that
[16:45] would come upon the man the human after
[16:47] the fall before the fall there was no
[16:50] fear but ever since then man has been
[16:53] declining towards fear but all of our
[16:55] fears can be summed up in one fear and
[16:59] that's the fear of losing your existence
[17:03] that is the fear ultimately that we all
[17:07] fear that the world fears in fact let me
[17:11] go further and say that every other fear
[17:13] is just a symptom of that one disease
[17:16] that fear of losing your existence the
[17:20] the instinct of self-preservation is
[17:24] stronger than any other instinct you
[17:27] have in your body the fear to preserve
[17:30] your own it comes on top of every other
[17:33] instinct and we're afraid fear of we
[17:37] have fear of anything that would
[17:39] threaten what we would call our
[17:41] well-being our health our happiness it's
[17:44] not a sinful thing that's a natural
[17:46] thing that's inside of you the fear of
[17:49] something that would threaten our health
[17:51] or happiness and ultimately that's the
[17:55] fear of death and man is afraid to die
[17:59] because it's the one thing death is the
[18:01] one thing that threatens your existence
[18:04] and you may postpone it but it's
[18:07] inevitable we're all gonna die that's
[18:11] inevitable with humanity now of course
[18:13] we believe in a rapture we believe in a
[18:15] body change but ultimately your body the
[18:18] flesh the temple you're living in is
[18:19] dying every single day it gets closer to
[18:22] death and so it brings our existent
[18:26] to an inn and what's incredible though
[18:28] to me today is that we find people are
[18:31] actually more afraid of what might
[18:34] happen to them before they die rather
[18:37] than what might happen to them after
[18:39] they die people humanity today is more
[18:43] afraid of what leads up to death and
[18:45] what happens before death and what
[18:47] they'll lose before they die but they
[18:50] never contemplate about life after death
[18:53] and what happens there's no in other
[18:55] words there's no fear of what might
[18:58] happen after death there's a fear of
[19:01] what happens before death Jesus says in
[19:04] Matthew chapter 10 and verse 28 he says
[19:08] in fear not this is Matthew chapter 10
[19:10] verse 28 he says and fear not them which
[19:13] kill the body but are not able to kill
[19:16] the soul but rather feel fear him which
[19:19] is able to destroy both soul and body in
[19:23] hell are not two sparrows sold for a
[19:26] farthing and one of them shall not fall
[19:28] on the ground without your father so
[19:30] notice what Jesus is saying here don't
[19:32] fear Him who can kill the body but fear
[19:34] him who can kill the soul and so people
[19:38] are more afraid it's it's it's actually
[19:40] it's the dying that people are afraid of
[19:44] today rather than death itself afraid of
[19:49] the dying and so there's one fear as we
[19:53] say today there's fear upon fear but you
[19:55] know there's one fear that is completely
[19:57] absent from our world that we live in
[20:00] today and that's the fear of God we fear
[20:05] everything the world fears everything
[20:08] but they lack the only fear that God
[20:10] told us to have and that's the fear of
[20:12] the Lord but the Bible says the fear of
[20:16] the Lord is the beginning of wisdom and
[20:20] so you want to be wise you want to have
[20:22] wisdom fear of the Lord it starts right
[20:25] there the first thing that we need to
[20:28] learn is to fear the Lord more than
[20:31] anything it's more than anything in the
[20:33] world you can live in a life of panic
[20:35] and a life of fear I mean fear can just
[20:38] become
[20:40] paralyzing you can live in that realm of
[20:42] constant fear and constant panic fear of
[20:44] this fear of that fear of this fear of
[20:46] that but the beginning of wisdom is the
[20:49] fear of the Lord you believe that so you
[20:52] notice that fear what is the fear the
[20:54] Lord mean that that word fear when Moses
[20:57] says that the Lord's come to test you
[20:59] that you may receive his fear that we
[21:02] you don't fear as the world fears but
[21:03] you receive his fear and that fear is a
[21:06] reverence it's a the reason the world
[21:09] doesn't fear God is because they are
[21:14] insensitive to the presence of God when
[21:18] you become aware of the presence of God
[21:21] you then fear God what what a brother
[21:25] branham say brother Branham said the
[21:26] reason people don't reverence God is
[21:28] because the reason people don't
[21:29] reverence the presence of God is because
[21:32] they don't recognize the presence of God
[21:35] so the fear of the Lord what is the fear
[21:37] of the Lord it's in a way it's not oh
[21:39] god I'm so afraid of you you're gonna
[21:40] you know if I mess up if I do wrong
[21:42] you're just gonna wipe me up that's not
[21:44] what the fear of the Lord is at all but
[21:47] the fear of the Lord is a reverence it's
[21:49] a godly awareness that's that word right
[21:52] there is about the only word I need to
[21:53] use lest I confuse it it's an awareness
[21:56] of God it's an awareness of the of a
[22:01] holy God as Moses says for our guards
[22:05] Hebrew says for our God is a consuming
[22:07] fire notice what he says here at the
[22:10] very end there that worse that would
[22:12] that verse that we read in verse 28 of
[22:14] Hebrews chapter in chapter 12 he says
[22:17] here in verse 28 wherefore we receiving
[22:19] a kingdom which cannot be moved let us
[22:22] have grace whereby we may serve God
[22:24] acceptable acceptable notice with
[22:27] reverence and godly fear for our God is
[22:32] a consuming fire so there's we don't
[22:37] fear as the world fears but we have fear
[22:40] we fear the right things not the wrong
[22:43] things there's even a scripture in
[22:45] Isaiah where it says just that it says
[22:47] don't you we don't don't have the fear
[22:49] that they fear don't have it right here
[22:51] before me but the fear of the Lord is Oh
[22:53] is an awareness it's a it's a
[22:55] recognition it's a recognition of the
[22:58] presence of God not just you it's not
[23:00] recognizing that Jesus lived this will
[23:03] never produce the fear of God the
[23:06] recognition or the Mentalist the mental
[23:08] agreement that Jesus was a man who lived
[23:10] doesn't ring on the fear of God the
[23:13] recognition of a historical account of
[23:15] what God did yesterday doesn't bring a
[23:17] fear of God but a present current day
[23:20] awareness of a presence of a living God
[23:24] who's amongst you right now in your
[23:26] everyday life brings a fear of God
[23:31] that's what keeps you from sin fear of
[23:34] the Lord that's what God taught that's
[23:35] what that's what Moses said he said the
[23:38] Lord's come to test you to try you that
[23:40] you may fear them that you may not sin
[23:41] and so the fear of God it's a it's a
[23:45] it's a it's a fear or an awareness that
[23:48] that God oh that were held accountable
[23:50] for our motives we're held accountable
[23:53] for our thoughts that there's a the Holy
[23:56] Spirit is just that what is the holy
[23:57] spirit it's the spirit of Jesus Christ
[23:59] living inside of you and when you have
[24:02] that spirit of Jesus Christ living
[24:03] inside you it's a tutor it's a teacher
[24:05] it's a convicted of sin it's that it's
[24:08] that it's that voice inside of you that
[24:10] tells you you're doing wrong you
[24:12] shouldn't do that not to do that don't
[24:14] ever disobey that voice that's the voice
[24:17] of the Lord speaking to you in the in a
[24:19] spirit in your own spirit that if you
[24:21] have the Holy Spirit the Holy Spirit
[24:23] convicts you of sin convicts you when
[24:27] you're wrong so that that fear of the
[24:29] Lord is that you realize that there's
[24:32] the err that there's an account that
[24:34] you're accountable for your thoughts
[24:35] you're accountable for your motives your
[24:37] words your acts your actions and so what
[24:41] is the fear of the Lord it's a desire to
[24:43] say I want to I want to reverence the
[24:45] Lord I want to live in harmony with what
[24:47] he wants I want to live in harmony with
[24:49] his actions with what he views as
[24:52] righteousness I want to live by that
[24:54] righteousness and so notice here the
[24:57] Bible says the fear of the Lord is the
[25:00] beginning of wisdom so we're out of time
[25:03] here this morning didn't didn't get to
[25:05] exactly what we wanted to but we
[25:07] kind of stop right there and just trust
[25:09] the Lord until next time let's stand to
[25:11] our feet and let's just pray Lord Jesus
[25:12] we thank you Father Lord that you as
[25:15] your word says have you've not given us
[25:17] the spirit of fear that doesn't mean we
[25:19] can't receive it Lord you just said I'm
[25:21] not the one who gives that spirit I give
[25:23] you a spirit of power of love and of a
[25:25] sound mind Lord keep us from fearful
[25:29] Lord of a world of fear keep us Lord
[25:32] Jesus and your word keep us in your
[25:34] presence O God I pray and Jesus Christ
[25:37] name Amen
