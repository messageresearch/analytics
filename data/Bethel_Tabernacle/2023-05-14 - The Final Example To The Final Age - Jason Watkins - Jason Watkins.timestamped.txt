[5:56] and I can't really look at my screens
[6:00] either
[6:01] without a little bit of
[6:04] amen a little bit of knocking it down
[6:06] praise the Lord
[6:08] so I thank you for your prayers and
[6:10] we'll have
[6:12] an announcement you know kind of make it
[6:16] for the sake of the internet I know that
[6:18] um
[6:19] I sent to you all yesterday
[6:21] and so uh we'll kind of make an
[6:23] announcement from the pulpit in the main
[6:25] service amen Revelation chapter 22 this
[6:28] morning
[6:29] and I want to begin this series that I'm
[6:33] going to go the Lord willing through the
[6:35] remainder of this month and in through
[6:37] June through the end of June
[6:40] on the Sunday School classes and I'll
[6:43] take an occasional Wednesday also
[6:45] and so um I I wore my Apple watch today
[6:49] because it'll it's like a it'll keep
[6:52] track and I can set a timer and if I get
[6:55] preaching it'll warn me
[6:58] it'll give me one or two it'll say
[7:00] you're in a loud environment you need to
[7:02] move Outdoors amen or it'll try to dial
[7:05] 9-1-1 it thinks I'm being killed or
[7:07] something like that and it'll start
[7:09] buzzing so as long as I don't feel that
[7:12] I think I'll be okay amen Revelation
[7:15] chapter 20 22 and I don't I said might
[7:20] have said 21 but we're coming to 22
[7:22] we're going to read 18.
[7:27] uh trying to find what
[7:29] okay well let's just read our text from
[7:31] your Bibles in Revelation chapter 22
[7:35] and uh let's begin uh verse 18.
[7:42] for I testify unto every man that
[7:45] heareth the words of the prophecy of
[7:47] this book
[7:49] If any man shall add unto these things
[7:51] God shall add unto him the plagues that
[7:55] are written in this book
[7:57] and if any man shall take away from the
[8:00] words of the book of this prophecy God
[8:03] shall take away his part out of the book
[8:05] of life and out of the holy city and
[8:09] from the things which are written in
[8:11] this book amen he that he which
[8:15] testifieth these things saith surely I
[8:18] come quickly amen even so come Lord
[8:21] Jesus the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ
[8:24] be with you all amen praise the Lord
[8:28] let's pray father we thank you for these
[8:32] scriptural verses Lord that we have read
[8:34] here this morning and we ask for your
[8:37] help now as we begin to bring this
[8:40] thought to the people lord it's um on my
[8:43] heart for some for some time and so I'm
[8:47] thanking you for the opportunity Lord to
[8:51] be able to divert to a different way
[8:54] and at the same time accomplish
[8:57] something Lord of a burden so I'm giving
[9:00] it into your hands now in Jesus name
[9:02] amen God bless you you can be seated
[9:05] let's have my title slide as soon as you
[9:08] have it Brothers
[9:15] yeah okay
[9:17] okay
[9:19] all right
[9:20] so okay dismissed no I'm just kidding
[9:25] it's all right I will um I will describe
[9:29] to you what you're not seeing
[9:33] so if we um had the
[9:37] um screen up this morning I wanted to
[9:40] begin this series today and it is indeed
[9:43] going to be a series in multiple parts
[9:45] and I'm calling it the final example to
[9:50] the final age now you'd be very familiar
[9:53] with the statement that the bride is the
[9:56] final voice to the final age amen but if
[10:00] you'll remember that when the Apostle
[10:03] Paul
[10:03] was speaking about to sisters and how
[10:07] that they should Adorn themselves and
[10:09] and how you know an adorned means to
[10:11] beautify and and the way that they
[10:13] beautify themselves as in modest apparel
[10:15] and uh one of the things that he points
[10:18] out is to have a chaste conversation
[10:21] amen you want to you need that on the
[10:24] screen up here
[10:31] oh okay all right cool
[10:33] all right so uh you remember that
[10:36] brother Branham or excuse me the Apostle
[10:38] Paul one of the other characteristics
[10:41] that he points out is that they should
[10:44] have a chaste conversation now whether
[10:47] it's a woman or a man it's just like we
[10:49] read here he says if any man
[10:52] you know add to or if any man take away
[10:54] does that not include sisters of course
[10:56] it does it actually is a Greek word that
[10:58] means mankind Humanity at large and so
[11:02] the principle given to a sister would
[11:04] also apply to a brother that a Chase
[11:07] conversation now I'm going to make a
[11:09] connection because the word conversation
[11:12] in the Greek means your behavior so it's
[11:15] not about you know the words coming out
[11:18] of her mouth it's the words coming from
[11:21] the expression of her life
[11:23] amen so now so now you should be able to
[11:28] easily connect the final voice to the
[11:32] final age as a final example amen
[11:36] because it's a chaste conversation it's
[11:39] a Godly lifestyle it's a lifestyle of
[11:43] Holiness and so this was going to be the
[11:46] title of my the theme and title of my
[11:49] Series going forward through this month
[11:51] in June the final example to the final
[11:54] age now as a as a a kind of a sub
[11:58] scripture underneath my title
[12:01] you would find Hebrews 13 and 8. now
[12:06] this is a great theme for us this is the
[12:08] theme that brother Branham used
[12:09] constantly Jesus Christ the same
[12:12] yesterday and today and forever amen now
[12:17] the reason that that that I'm bringing
[12:19] that in is because if there's going to
[12:22] be a final example a final voice a final
[12:26] lived life to a final age as an example
[12:29] then certainly it's going to be Jesus
[12:33] Christ the same yesterday today and
[12:35] forever because in the mystery of the
[12:38] Rapture when he descends in a shout and
[12:40] a voice and a trumpet it's Christ doing
[12:42] all three through human instrumentality
[12:44] all right so so when he when he comes to
[12:48] a prophet that's not William branham's
[12:51] message or even his thinking that it's
[12:53] actually the mind of Christ speaking
[12:55] through a prophet and therefore when it
[12:57] comes into the time of the of the final
[13:00] voice to the final age you you don't get
[13:02] to pick and choose you don't get to
[13:06] um you know to alter or change what the
[13:11] expression ought to be based on the
[13:14] message that came and so it it the Lord
[13:18] clearly brought to us how he wants us to
[13:21] live and what the idea is is to have his
[13:26] voice
[13:27] speaking through your life to the world
[13:32] all right you got that so it's Jesus
[13:34] Christ the same yesterday today and
[13:36] forever that's how you can identify the
[13:38] new birth that's how you can identify
[13:40] true Doctrine you always remember this
[13:42] you're always wanting to find out where
[13:46] is the I am
[13:48] because the I am is a present tense
[13:51] expression that it it's it's it's
[13:54] whatever form God is operating in
[13:58] presently that's the I am
[14:01] see so when when he says to the Lord
[14:04] when Moses said to the lord they're
[14:06] going to ask me who sent me see and and
[14:09] what will I say they're going to ask me
[14:11] you know what's his name and what will I
[14:13] say and the Lord said to Moses say to
[14:16] them you're me
[14:18] amen say to them I am hath sent me
[14:21] because it'll be me inside your mouth
[14:24] brother Bradham dealt with that in the
[14:26] fourth seal how that he said like from
[14:28] God's mouth to Moses mouth it was God
[14:31] saying I have come down I have heard the
[14:35] Cry of my people I will deliver them
[14:37] according to my promise I made Abraham
[14:39] but I'm sending you Moses and I will
[14:43] speak through your mouth and when you
[14:45] speak it'll be me speaking see so you're
[14:49] always wanting to see where the I am
[14:51] when Jesus was when John was baptizing
[14:54] that was the I am he was the anointed
[14:56] word for that hour he was in that sense
[14:58] Christ when Jesus comes on the scene
[15:01] John says now I must decrease he must
[15:04] increase because now the I am was
[15:07] walking the shores of Galilee you follow
[15:09] that so when he came into the upper room
[15:12] and Beca and the ministry of the son of
[15:14] man moved into the bride body then she
[15:17] became Christ she became Mrs Jesus she
[15:21] became a voice to the age and and that's
[15:25] why Paul could establish the teaching
[15:28] that Paul's Paul was the final voice to
[15:31] all the ages nothing could ever be
[15:33] changed from Paul's teaching all right
[15:36] now I'm having to bring all of this as a
[15:39] foundation all right you're still with
[15:40] me
[15:42] so so we find out don't make me start
[15:45] preaching
[15:46] so we've so we so we find out that that
[15:50] the the the what we're trying to show
[15:52] you here is that now the I am was in the
[15:56] church all right and you're gonna find
[15:58] and I'm not gonna get to it today we'll
[16:00] get to it next time that brother Branham
[16:03] shows how that when he says I'm Alpha
[16:05] and Omega brother Branham in three
[16:07] different places 1958 1960 and 1964 says
[16:12] that he you notice he doesn't say
[16:14] anything in the in between he's the
[16:16] first and the last he's the beginning
[16:18] and the end he's the root and The
[16:20] Offspring of David men he's before David
[16:22] and after David he's the Alpha and the
[16:25] Omega and so but brother Brandon points
[16:27] to the fact that he doesn't talk about
[16:29] the middle and it's not that he's not in
[16:32] the middle because he promised to never
[16:34] leave the church and you can see him
[16:35] walking through the seven golden
[16:36] lampstands but what brother Branham is
[16:39] bringing out is that what's in them that
[16:41] he's he he he is in the middle but not
[16:45] everything in the middle is him now
[16:48] you've got man-made indoctrination
[16:50] injections and so you you then
[16:53] consequently that affects the level of
[16:56] the of the token that can even be on the
[16:59] church and Through the Ages that affects
[17:01] the power of God that there have access
[17:04] to during the ages but we find that at
[17:07] the end time the Jubilee was to return
[17:10] the token was to return the abstract was
[17:12] to return the original Alpha message the
[17:16] Omega was to be the alpha restored and
[17:19] so so we find that that God has come
[17:22] into this final age and he is calling
[17:26] for a final people to be a final Voice
[17:30] or a final expression or a final example
[17:34] of the word because the whole world has
[17:39] this
[17:41] but this is locked up in secret and
[17:43] mystery see and it takes the Holy Spirit
[17:46] to reveal it and when he reveals it he
[17:48] reveals it to his family and his family
[17:51] go forth interpreting this in their
[17:54] lives
[17:55] God doesn't need me or you to
[17:58] reinterpret the message he doesn't need
[18:00] me to redo the shell that's finished
[18:03] we have a completed message what now God
[18:06] needs you and I to do is to be the
[18:08] living voice see
[18:10] because this has always been God's
[18:12] pattern you can find that when he set
[18:14] Israel down in the midst he dropped
[18:17] Israel as a nation right down he
[18:19] reserved Canaan that little section of
[18:22] land that he would give to Abraham and
[18:24] his seed when God said lift up your eyes
[18:27] and look north south east and west and
[18:29] everything you see I've given you and he
[18:30] it'll have from this border to this
[18:32] border and from this sea to this to this
[18:34] area and and and if you'll notice that
[18:37] God dropped them down as it were right
[18:41] in the middle of he the Nations they
[18:44] were surrounded by Heathen Nations
[18:46] because what God is doing his principle
[18:49] is to establish an example Nation so
[18:53] that the rest of the world who does not
[18:55] know who the real God was they could
[18:58] look at Israel and say and by Israel's
[19:01] life and by the power that operated and
[19:05] by the anointing and by the blessing of
[19:07] God upon them then the world would be
[19:11] could could could have something to look
[19:14] to could could say Israel's God is the
[19:18] true God see and so now the problem was
[19:22] Israel didn't do a very good job of that
[19:25] and they ended up being taken into
[19:27] captivity but remember that in the
[19:30] Millennium God is going to restore
[19:33] Israel as the leading nation of the
[19:36] world
[19:37] amen now he has a gentile bride but
[19:40] Israel's always his people and he's
[19:42] going to restore Israel as a leading
[19:44] Nation all through the Old Testament it
[19:47] prophesies of that that he's going to
[19:49] restore them as the leading nation of
[19:50] the world in the millennial world and
[19:52] he'll have a gentile bride uh as as the
[19:55] as the executors of his will the
[19:58] dispensers of his word and uh you know
[20:01] and and even the enforcers of his word
[20:03] and so so God now is trying with this
[20:08] same principle at the end time before
[20:11] mankind moves beyond the point of no
[20:14] return before the Gentiles have no more
[20:17] opportunity to be saved he's using that
[20:20] same principle to lift up a bride before
[20:23] the world and say forget what your Bible
[20:26] school told you about this My bride is
[20:29] the interpretation of this forget what
[20:31] you learn by tradition I have a family
[20:34] in the earth who have eaten my word and
[20:38] they have become my word and they are
[20:41] the final example they are the final
[20:45] voice they are the final Authority
[20:49] see
[20:50] so this becomes important because that
[20:54] you know whether or not we speak of you
[20:58] know this series is going to talk about
[21:00] you know whole house Family Values it's
[21:04] going to talk about applying the token
[21:06] to your home we're going to cover
[21:08] principles for a Godly marriage we're
[21:11] going to cover raising children the
[21:13] Bible way we're going to talk about
[21:15] transitioning your teen to adulthood
[21:18] we're going to talk about biblical
[21:20] dedication and finances but all of these
[21:24] if you could see my slide all of these
[21:26] point two one verse that and and we
[21:31] didn't read it but in verse 17 the
[21:34] spirit and the bride say come because
[21:37] now they have become they have become
[21:40] unified very good all right now let's go
[21:42] through it can I control it from here I
[21:44] would imagine hey
[21:46] let's see all right so
[21:49] perfect now I wanted to go to you might
[21:54] have to run it there let me try this
[21:55] again
[21:56] oh there we go it went perfect
[21:59] seems to be going slow okay got it I got
[22:02] it now all right now I wanted to go into
[22:05] Nehemiah because Nehemiah goes to
[22:07] Jerusalem now let me give you the
[22:10] historical setting
[22:11] zerubbabel has already went forward for
[22:15] a there's been a three-phase restoration
[22:17] of of Jerusalem and so and the Temple
[22:21] and so we find out that zerubbabel is
[22:24] going back to lay the foundation Ezra is
[22:27] going to come behind him to build on top
[22:30] of that and to advance forward and then
[22:32] Nehemiah is going to come to restore the
[22:35] city and restore the walls restore
[22:37] families and set the priesthood back in
[22:39] order Nehemiah is going to be the
[22:42] finishing move to everything God has
[22:44] done you're with me now it's important
[22:47] to go to Nehemiah because we're about to
[22:50] connect it to revelation 22 17 for this
[22:52] reason that when Nehemiah goes comes to
[22:56] the king uh we find that it's near the
[22:59] time of the Feast of Tabernacles now the
[23:01] Feast of Tabernacles is the last feast
[23:04] in The Seven Feast of Israel and it and
[23:07] it's a feast of booths and it and and
[23:09] they lived in these booths for a Time
[23:11] time and then at the end of The Feast
[23:14] they disassemble those booths and that's
[23:17] exactly what's happening to you and I
[23:19] that we live in this body but this body
[23:21] is going to be disassembled and I'm
[23:23] going to get a new body amen and so we
[23:26] find that brother Branham said the Feast
[23:28] of Tabernacles is the is connected to
[23:30] the Millennium he taught that in
[23:32] numerous places so so you understand
[23:35] that that when Nehemiah comes for the
[23:39] final move to restore Israel to bring it
[23:42] back to its Glory that had been sacked
[23:44] out by Nebuchadnezzar he's going to try
[23:47] to rebuild Solomon's Temple as best they
[23:49] can even though it's not going to have
[23:51] as much Grandeur as that one but they're
[23:53] told don't despise the day of small
[23:55] things
[23:56] so so we find that brother Matt taught
[23:59] on that brother Matt Watkins how that
[24:02] you know when you when you looked at the
[24:04] Temple of Solomon
[24:06] it was so amazing so beautiful so
[24:11] wonderful it was it was almost like an
[24:13] ancient wonder of the world but yet when
[24:16] you find that when Jesus came he was a
[24:22] greater than that Temple he was that
[24:25] Temple personified now in him there was
[24:28] no Beauty
[24:29] to be desired is that what the scripture
[24:32] says he's a lowly Nazarene but yet even
[24:36] though his Beauty was less and his
[24:39] stature was less and you wouldn't
[24:40] naturally compare him to the Grandeur of
[24:43] Solomon's Temple but yet he was a
[24:45] greater form of it you see so so the the
[24:49] that's why he said don't despise the day
[24:50] of small things God knew what he was
[24:52] doing
[24:52] yeah and so they're they're the the
[24:54] elders who had saw Solomon's Temple are
[24:56] lamenting during the days of zerubbabel
[24:59] and Ezra and Nehemiah saying oh this
[25:00] Temple's nothing we remember the old
[25:02] days
[25:09] or and every time it gets less it's
[25:12] going to be more until it finally comes
[25:14] to Jesus Christ and it's going to be
[25:16] fantastic
[25:17] and then when he brings it into a people
[25:19] you know I I know we look at ourselves
[25:22] and we don't feel very much like the
[25:24] temple of God but you're a greater
[25:26] version of the temple of God this is why
[25:28] even Jesus would say more than this
[25:31] shall you do for I go to my father so
[25:34] now it's going to be Christ multiplied
[25:36] into the Earth
[25:38] amen remains calm
[25:41] so so we so we find then that when he
[25:45] comes you're going to see this now
[25:46] remember it's at the time the near time
[25:49] of the Feast of Tabernacles and he says
[25:52] and it came to pass in the month and the
[25:54] sun in the 20th year of Arctic Xerxes
[25:57] the king that wine was before him
[26:01] uh and I took up the wine Nehemiah was a
[26:04] cup Bearer I took up the wine and gave
[26:06] it unto the king now I had not been
[26:09] formally sad in his presence first of
[26:11] all that would get you killed in the in
[26:13] the in the Far East you didn't come
[26:15] before the Monarch sad you didn't even
[26:18] come distressed if you did they could
[26:20] cut your head off for that you're not
[26:21] supposed to do anything to distress the
[26:23] king he says now I had not come formerly
[26:26] sad in his presence wherefore the king
[26:28] said unto me this goes to show how much
[26:30] he valued Nehemiah he doesn't have him
[26:32] killed for it he actually has a heart of
[26:34] compassion he says wherefore the king
[26:35] said unto me why is thy countenance sad
[26:38] seeing Thou Art not sick this is nothing
[26:41] else but sorrow of heart then I was very
[26:44] sore afraid
[26:46] see because now this is a death sentence
[26:49] and so the king is inquiring why are you
[26:51] in my presence sad and so he says here
[26:55] and and said and said unto the king
[26:59] let the King live forever why should not
[27:02] my countenance be sad when the city the
[27:06] place of my father's sepulchers lieth
[27:09] waste and the gates thereof are consumed
[27:12] with fire
[27:14] then the king said unto me for what Dost
[27:17] thou make request so I prayed to the god
[27:21] of Heaven he's praying for strength you
[27:23] could read that earlier on in the text
[27:24] he's praying for courage I mean he's
[27:26] taking his life in his into his hands to
[27:28] do this it's like it's like Esther she
[27:30] said if I perish I perish but I'm going
[27:32] to see the king
[27:33] and he says here
[27:36] um
[27:41] not switch okay there we go there we go
[27:44] so he says and I said unto the king
[27:48] if it pleased the king and If thy
[27:50] servant have found favor in thy sight
[27:52] that thou would Ascend me unto Judah
[27:54] unto the city of my father's sepulchers
[27:57] that I may build it
[27:58] and the King said unto me notice I have
[28:01] it underlined the queen also sitting by
[28:03] him that is the only place in the whole
[28:06] Bible that you find that statement
[28:09] there's nowhere else that's noted the
[28:12] queen also sitting with him for how long
[28:14] shall thy journey be and when wilt thou
[28:17] return so it pleased the king to send me
[28:20] and I set him a time now this is exactly
[28:25] why when the queen which this is Esther
[28:28] in history even even commentators agree
[28:30] with that uh you find for support for
[28:32] that in jfb commentary particularly it's
[28:35] first place I ever noticed it when you
[28:37] do the historical math it does make
[28:38] perfect sense so this is Now esther
[28:41] Seated on the throne with the King
[28:45] and and she's literally it doesn't say
[28:48] she's speaking but it says the queen
[28:50] sitting with him means that she was
[28:52] consenting that his voice she was
[28:55] agreeing they were speaking in one
[28:57] unified voice you get that at the time
[29:00] of the Feast of Tabernacles which is the
[29:02] millennium
[29:04] amen so then we connect now where are we
[29:08] at we're just at the millennium what's
[29:11] the promise and the spirit and the bride
[29:13] say come the spirit and the bride say
[29:16] come see and let him that is The Thirst
[29:20] say come and let him that uh and
[29:23] whosoever will let him come take the
[29:25] Water of Life freely this is the bride's
[29:27] privilege to offer she's the only one
[29:30] authorized to offer the Water of Life I
[29:33] remember several years ago I was
[29:34] preaching in Canada Pope Francis had
[29:37] made his uh his famous uh Jubilee
[29:40] announcement he was offering Jubilee to
[29:42] the whole world
[29:44] which is a going free of your debt a
[29:46] pardoning of all your transgression and
[29:48] a restoration back to the family he's
[29:50] basically trying to bring everybody back
[29:52] to Mother Rome and they asked me those
[29:55] Brothers there in Quebec and they said
[29:57] brother Jason what do you think about
[29:58] the Pope's uh pronouncement his
[30:01] proclamation of Jubilee and I said it's
[30:03] illegitimate and they said well what do
[30:05] you mean by that I said only the bride
[30:07] is authorized to offer Jubilee only the
[30:10] bride can offer the Waters of Life
[30:12] freely it's it's the one who has come
[30:14] into Unity with the spirit so now you've
[30:17] got king and queen seated back on the
[30:20] throne again see at the time of the
[30:24] Feast of Tabernacles so this is why we
[30:28] correlate king and queen and showed
[30:30] Nehemiah connecting to Revelation 22.
[30:33] now brother Branham says and I got I got
[30:35] I'm going to use my five minutes of
[30:36] overtime here
[30:38] so he says it is the rising of the Sun
[30:41] and as he being the groom the bride has
[30:44] to come forth because it's part of him
[30:46] and it can only be the manifestation of
[30:50] the fulfilling of all the revelations uh
[30:52] any others has spoke of the Bride it can
[30:56] only uh manifest
[30:59] if it does something different from the
[31:01] groom it isn't the bride because she is
[31:06] flesh of his flesh bone of his bone life
[31:11] of his life power of his power she is
[31:16] him
[31:18] now as I've taught you before she's not
[31:20] literally him you don't pray to me I
[31:22] didn't die for you but Hebrews 13 8 is
[31:25] the theme of the message and that's the
[31:27] key to unlocking this statement she's
[31:29] she's the same as him she's the
[31:32] continuation of him does that make sense
[31:35] Soul so brother Branham goes on
[31:39] as as man and woman are one see now here
[31:42] we're coming back to king and queen as
[31:45] man and woman are one and woman taken
[31:47] from his side she has taken a spirit the
[31:51] feminist Spirit from him that's in tight
[31:54] now we're not talking about a female
[31:55] Holy Ghost we're talking in type all
[31:58] right he's correlating in type the flesh
[32:01] from because brother Branham said when
[32:03] that when that Roman spear pierced that
[32:07] original blood cell in his side that
[32:10] released the bride that released the
[32:12] life see even though he was dead
[32:15] that life was still inside the blood
[32:17] even though he was dead and when they
[32:19] pierced that tip of that same spear
[32:22] brother Branham said it pierced that
[32:24] original the one that he placed in the
[32:27] womb of Mary he said it pierced that
[32:30] original blood cell and that blood cell
[32:32] was a spoken word creation therefore it
[32:36] released the life to go into the bride
[32:38] therefore you are the you are born again
[32:41] as the literal life of almighty God
[32:45] you see that
[32:47] so so he's saying here the flesh from
[32:50] his side made both mechanics and
[32:53] Dynamics the wife
[32:55] the wife is the Dynamics
[32:57] why do you think we're praying why do
[32:59] you think brother Branham said that the
[33:01] Dynamics of this church will be a
[33:03] refilling of the Holy Ghost that we've
[33:05] operated in a small way but it's coming
[33:06] a big way why because he has a wife here
[33:09] who's the final voice who's the final
[33:12] example who's the final Authority amen
[33:16] so he said the spirit of him and the
[33:19] Flesh of him and put it together and
[33:21] made mechanics and Dynamics this is
[33:23] exactly why you're going to see in this
[33:25] next verse this is exactly why Bible
[33:28] schools can't produce the life of God
[33:30] all they have is mechanics
[33:32] and they don't even understand the
[33:34] mechanics
[33:35] the engine doesn't hardly run very
[33:38] smooth because it's all it's not running
[33:39] right because they don't even understand
[33:41] what's supposed to be the settings and
[33:44] what's supposed to be operating but we
[33:47] find that the Bride Watch The Spirit of
[33:49] him and the Flesh of him and put it
[33:51] together and made mechanics and Dynamics
[33:55] um oh you know what I uh I didn't I
[33:57] didn't put it on there I should have I
[33:59] if you go on down and you go home today
[34:01] and you read it
[34:02] you'll find out brother Branham talks
[34:04] about denominational systems they have
[34:07] mechanics but he said at on the day of
[34:09] the Rapture that that the that the that
[34:14] the mechanics and Dynamics which is the
[34:17] bride
[34:18] when that engine gets fired up she'll go
[34:20] in a rapture and the other engine of
[34:24] man-made Creed will just sit right here
[34:25] and go into a tribulation because it
[34:27] can't get off the ground
[34:31] amen
[34:34] amen it can't get off the ground
[34:37] this is exactly why I said to you
[34:40] so whether we are preaching on whole
[34:44] house family values in this series or
[34:48] whether we're going to teach on we're
[34:50] teaching on it not preaching on it
[34:51] whether we're teaching on whole house
[34:53] Family Values applying the token to your
[34:57] home principles for a Godly marriage
[34:59] right
