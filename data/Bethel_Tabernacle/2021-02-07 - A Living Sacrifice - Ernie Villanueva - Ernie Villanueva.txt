ellie old friend you know and a friend to our family particularly over the many many years my it's multiple decades at this point and amen looking forward to eternity with people like that amen you're looking forward to eternity now you're about to go there because the word that's coming is coming from that realm now you'll never catch it if you stay down here in this earthly as an earthly creature you want to say lord lift me up right raise me up lord lift me up above the shadows of this carnal world and let me move into the heavenlies the singing the worship has already helped you do that if you've entered into the worship praise the lord so we're now going to turn to the greatest part of the service the whole main reason why we're here and uh you know believe it or not the greatest reason was not for us to see you the greatest reason for us was all to see him amen praise the lord so brother ernie we want you to take your liberty today and we had him yesterday morning at the men's bible study breakfast what a time we had in the word i i rarely see all the brothers everybody wanting to chime in and say something i never saw so many angles on a on a book out of the bible only 25 verses long the book of philemon but brother ernie had it rolling yesterday it was fantastic amen so let's sing some more that as we invite him to come amen and bring us the word today amen [Music] revealing the son of man [Music] soon sing with me however [Applause] amen god bless your saints you know his brother jason was saying we've got to enter into that supernatural realm and a believer is a super intelligent being with a divine purpose in their life and brother branham loved to use the word the mystical and the definition of a mystic and i trust that we're all mystics here today a mystic is one who seeks after and attains direct intercourse with god and there is only one truth there is only one sanity in this entire world and unfortunately 99.99 of the people in the world do not know what you know and that's god's doing if it was me when i first come to the message i was fresh out of pentecost and i was you know i was wanting everybody to see this message and then one time i was i was reading a message and brother branham said sometimes you have to say things in such a way as to cause people to go away and i'm saying whoa he said you have to get rid of the creepers and there sure were a whole bunch of creepers that were running around brother branham's ministry hundreds of thousands of them in america and take millions of them around the world that started off with the message but they never finished the course so i'd like to invite you to turn in the book of leviticus we're going to look at chapter 2 and start reading at verse 1 and and you know i i don't like to plead with people but i'm pleading with you that you pinch yourself or or do whatever you have to do but really concentrate on the beginning of the message because if you miss the beginning at the end you're going to wonder where in the world did all this come from or where did it end up to and it's personal to you personal to me personal to every son and daughter of god that's living on this earth this is a personal supernatural mystical message okay so in leviticus chapter two in verse 1. the sweet savant savor offerings these are the meat offerings or the sweet offerings leviticus chapter 2. i'm just saying that these are the sweet offerings and when one will offer a meat offering unto the lord his offering shall be a fine flower and he shall pour oil upon it and put frankincense thereon and he shall bring it to aaron's son the priest and he shall take it thereout and the handful of the flower thereof and of the oil thereof with all the frankincense thereof and the priest shall burn the memorial of it upon the altar to be an offering made by fire of a sweet savor unto the lord and the remnant of the meat offering shall be aarons and his sons it is a thing most holy of the offerings of the lord made by fire and if thou bring an oblation of a meat offering bacon in the oven it shall be of unleavened cakes a fine flower mingle with oil of unleavened wafers anointed with oil and if the oblation be a meat offering bacon in a pan it shall be a fine flour unleavened mingle with oil thou shall part it in pieces and pour oil thereon it is a meat offering and if thou oblation be a meat offering bacon in the frying pan it shall be made a fine flour with oil and thou shall bring the meat offering that is made by these things unto the lord and when it is presented unto the priest he shall bring it unto the altar now drop down to verse 11 no meat offering which we shall bring unto the lord shall be made with leaven very important no leaven for ye shall burn no leaven nor any honey so no leaven and no honey in any offering of the lord made by fire and that the oblation of in thy oblation of the firstfruits ye shall offer them unto the lord but they shall not be burnt on the altar for a sweet savor and every oblation of thy meat offering shalt of season with salt neither shalt thou suffer the salt of the covenant of thy god to be lacking from thy meat offering with all thine offerings thou shalt offer salt god bless you let's pray father we know that this book that we hold in our hands it is a supernatural book it's a book that you inspired 40 different authors to pen 66 books over many many decades of history and now we see that each one of these books it comes together this is your divine supernatural love story that you had in your mind before the foundation of the world and now we're coming down to the climax of this great tremendous drama and we're so thankful that you have allowed us and you have trusted us to live in this age knowing that we would overcome by the great message that you have sent to us in this day so i pray today that you would bless both speaker and hearer and that that no man would be glorified but only you and your word and your power and your august presence would be manifest amongst us and we ask these blessings with a great confidence for we ask them in your precious name of our lord jesus christ amen amen god bless you you can have your seats now in the beginning i i encourage you to pay attention to all the ingredients that were going to go into the offering you had fine flour and brother branham talked about that flour he talked about a device they had it was called the burr a b-u-r-r and he refers to it 28 times and somehow that brewer when they took the grain they would take that grain and grind it and every single piece came out the same size and we'll first refer to that a little bit later so it had to be fine flour and then there had to be oil and the oil had to be mixed with it and it had to be mixed up real good so there was no lumps in it and then there had to be added frankincense because frankincense it was the most precious and one of the most costly fragrances that there was and the secret of frankincense was it only was released when heat was applied to it and then we're told don't put any leaven in there we know that leaven is sin don't put any honey in there because when you heat honey it it it sours it it begins to ferment so don't put any honey in this offering and with this offering you shall offer salt because salt is a preservative so this is the meal offering and it's way back in leviticus and now god begins to point us now if we can turn in our bibles to the book of first kings we'll start reading at chapter 16 and uh just a a little bit of a lengthy reading but i want to just lay a foundation in the 30 and first year of ask the king of judah began christ to reign over israel 12 years he reigned a 12 year six year he reigned in terza and he brought the hill samaria of shima for two talents of silver and built on the hill and called the name of the city which he built after the name of shima owner of the hill samaria but now here's here's where we need to pay real strict attention because sometimes one paragraph sometimes one sentence or one word it just opens up a whole paradigm of what god is trying to show to us so he says but omri wrought evil in the sight of the lord and did worse than all a-l-l this king did worse than all that were before him so this was a bad man for he walked in all the ways of jeroboam the sons of nabat and in sin wherewith he made israel to sin to provoke the lord god of israel to anger with vanities now the rest of the acts of omri which he did and his might that he showed are they not written in the book of chronicles of the king of israel so omri slept with his fathers and was buried in samaria and ahab his son reigned in his stead and in the thirty and eighth year of assa king of judah began ahab the son of omri to reign over israel and ahab the son of omri reigned over israel and samaria twenty and two years and ahab the son of omri did evil in the sight of the lord above all that were before him so the wickedness is getting greater and greater and greater and it came to pass as if it had been a light thing for him to walk in the sins of jeroboam the sins of nabat that he took to wife jezebel a heathen a pagan took to wife jezebel this daughter of ethbell king of the zidonians and went and served baal and worshiped him this is the king of israel marries a pagan wife and right away we find out who's wearing the pants in that family and right away he's over there worshiping her god baal and he reared up an altar for bale in the house of baal which he had built in samaria and ahab made a grove and ahab did more to provoke the lord god of israel to anger than all the kings of israel that were before him so now this is israel this is god's chosen people but bad leaders rose up amongst them israel you know god had given israel that land he had driven he had driven the inhabitants off of the land to give it to the children of israel and america was the same way god gave america to the pilgrims religious freedom and america rose up and they had great leaders like george washington and abraham lincoln and and we see that as time progressed things got worse and worse and worse and worse as far as people who were dedicated to christ america was founded on christian principles now if you try to say that you'll have rioters and protesters outside your door if you try to say that america is a christian nation and jesus christ is the head of this nation so now because sin has entered into the land we look at chapter 17 of first kings very familiar scripture and elijah the tishbite who was of the inhabitants of gilead said unto ahab as the lord god of israel liveth before whom i stand there shall not be dew nor rain these years but according to my word now try to imagine ahab and jezebel sitting there and and this that this guy comes out of nowhere we don't know where he's from we don't know we don't even know how we get in who let this guy in here why was this man even allowed into my presence and look at the fool the fool saying that there's going to be no rain until this idiot calls for the rain imagine something so preposterous and the rain stopped and the word of the lord came unto him saying get thee hence and turn thou eastward and hide thy self by the brook chariot that is before jordan and it shall be that thou shalt drink of the brook and i have commanded the ravens to feed thee and he went and did according unto the word of the lord for he went and dwelt by the brook chariot that is before jordan and the ravens brought him bread and flesh in the morning and bread and flesh in the evening and he drank of the brook now you have to be a mystic you have to be one who believes in the supernatural to believe that god sent his prophet up to the brook cherith and every day room service came in bread and flesh in the morning bread and flesh in the evening and it was brought in by birds now brother branham said you might ask where did those birds get the bread and the flesh to feed elijah and brother branham said the same place that jesus got the bread to feed all those thousands that he had to feed so that's not that's not a difficult thing for god to do that you know when some people think about god they think about jesus and and the man who suffered on the cross and it's good to think about that but when you go back before the foundation of the world when god decided that he wanted to make a world he just said let there be and all the trillions of stars and planets and galaxies he just said let there be that's the god that i serve that's the god that i fall down before that's the god that i want to interact with that's the god that i want to live inside of me that's the god that tells me all things are possible so now the brook dries up and the word of the lord came unto him saying arise get thee to zero path which belongeth to zidon and dwell there behold i have commanded a widow woman to sustain thee now this widow woman she did not have a clue that she had been commanded to serve this guy that was coming brother branham was in a time machine you know the if you're in a submarine and the submarine wants to know what's going on above the water they have a periscope and that periscope goes up there and they can look all around well in this day god has given to us a prophet scope and god's prophets they were prophet scopes and god could take them and he could point them backward and tell them what has happened he could point him and tell him what is happening or he could point them forward and tell them what is going to happen and god told elijah i have commanded a widow woman and she's going to sustain thee so elijah he goes he goes walking down there and he went to zeropath maybe he came across a little picket fence there that he'd seen in the dream and when he came to the gate of the city behold the woman was there gathering sticks and he called to her and said fetch me i pray thee a little water and a vessel that i may drink and as she was going to fetch it now brother jason there is a famine and a drought and the most precious commodity right there in that land was water and here's this perfect stranger he comes up to a widow woman and he says hey get me a drink of water and she turned and she started going to get the water but then he adds to it he said fetch me i pray thee a little water in a vessel that i may drink and as she was going to fetch it he called to her and said bring me i pray the amorsal of bread in thine hand now that stopped her right there she turned around and she said to him as the lord thy god liveth i have not a cake but a handful of meal in a barrel and a little oil and a cruise and behold i am gathering two sticks not three sticks not four sticks she was gathering two sticks she had a little bit of meal and she had a little bit of oil and she was gathering two sticks and her testimony is i am gathering the two sticks that i may go in and dress it for me and my son that we may go and die that's desperation friends now i studied i've studied this message brother branham loves to tell the story and and i've searched all through the message and the things i'm going to share with you are not in all one paragraph where you'll be able to find them in the message but as you search through them you will find brother branham talking about the little widow woman and again this is not a guess this is a prophet looking in time looking and seeing exactly what was going through he says the little widow woman was the poorest of the pores she was weary unable to sleep all night she was tossed about because of this great tragedy big tears dripping from her eyes for many weeks listen listen to this for many weeks she'd had only one meal every three or four days and remember she's got a little baby also her husband had been lost in the battle for the lord he trusted god and gave his life for the cause of israel he was a gentile and this woman she's a gentile also her ragged nightgown was just about gone her sleeves were all ragged and her arms sticking out of them she lived decent and honorable and met all of god's requirements but still the lord remained silent her shoulders were stooped as she sat in her rocking chair shedding big tears and looking at her starving baby her cheekbones sticking out her arms frail as she sat ringing her bony hands the bones were dwindling away as the flesh goes from them she knew that only a handful of meals stood between her and death and then brother branham drops us in she wasn't going to eat of the cake she was going to bake she was going to feed her little baby and put him in her arms and die that's desperation this woman and this little boy they were spiritual skeletons there had been no rain for three and a half years and where there's no rain there's a famine there's drought and where there's a famine and drought people go hungry and if it continues they starve and starvation is one of the most horrible deaths you can ever witness some of you may have seen pictures of africa when they had those famines and those little boys and girls running around and looked like skeletons with skin stretched over them with no hope and by the thousands they died day by day by day because there was no nourishment coming in he talks about the little boy he said the boy was three or four years old he was unable to sleep over 20 minutes at a time because of his hunger he had on a ragged night shirt he had sinking cheeks his eyes were turning yellow and he was holding his stomach as he asked his mother if she was ready to bake the little cake then the conditions in the land the whole nation was starving and in a terrible condition the people in the city of zarepath were starving to death screaming for water it was a reflection of sin and immorality as the woman looked down the street she heard the people cursing and carrying on a world in insanity and so now we see that when the woman says i've only got just a little bit of a meal in a barrel and a little bit of oil and i'm gathering these two sticks that i might cook it and me and my son can go and die and elijah said unto him fear not go and do as thou has said but make me there of a little cake first and bring it unto me and after make for thee and for thy son for thus saith the lord god of israel you know those are the sweetest words that that woman ever heard in her life she knew the story she knew why there was a drought and a famine she knew that elijah had gone and elijah had spoken to the king and he's the one that called for the famine and now she perceived that this was a holy man and when he said thus saith the lord god of israel she knew that god had come to rescue her in her skeletal condition and her little boy amen the barrel of meal shall not waste neither shall the cruse of oil fail until the day that the lord sendeth rain upon the earth and she went and did according to the saying of elijah and she and he and her home did eat many days and the barrel of meal wasted not neither did the crews of oil fail according to the word of the lord which he spoke by elijah now think about that she made that first cake and she went and she gave it to elijah the prophet she was willing to sacrifice everything she had that's all she had and she was willing to give it upon his word that all was going to be well and her meal and her oil was never going to run out do you know from that time forth every single cake that she baked it was a miracle cake miracle cake after miracle cake after miracle cake after miracle cake she is baking miracle cakes out of what was empty in the barrel the cruise of oil everything was empty but she just kept baking and she kept baking and she kept baking and you know what every message book that you pick up friends this is a miracle cake and i wonder how many miracle cakes have we been eating recently what's your spiritual stamina like what's your strength what's your revelation like what's your insight like so now let's turn over to luke we're gonna look at chapter four now the beginning of chapter 4 jesus is going into the desert to be tempted of the devil 40 days and 40 nights without food without water and the devil doing his best to trick him up in his time of weakness in his time of of hunger and and the pains of no water so now in verse 12 we read and jesus answering said unto him it is said thou shalt not tempt the lord thy god and when the devil had ended all the temptation he departed from him for a season for a season he didn't leave permanently the devil was probably worn out forty days of this man with no food and no water and still i've done my best i've been deceiving man for four thousand years and i cannot get this guy not even a little bit so he left them for a season verse 14 and when jesus returned in the power of the spirit into galilee and they went out of fame of him through all the region round about and he taught in their synagogues being glorified of there's that word again being glorified of all if the bible said it was all it was all so the whole the whole area of galilee they had heard about the signs and the wonders and the miracles and he went into the synagogue and he taught being glorified of all and no doubt the group of people that were following him was getting greater and greater and the excitement level that the supernatural had come this is the first time that a prophet of god had visited israel in over 400 years and the people were excited but now jesus comes home homeboy makes good have you ever been in the area i lived in an area and and some celebrity came out of your area whether it was a politician or an actor or a singer or a sport oh yeah yeah he's from our area yeah yeah he he was right down the road maybe 50 miles he was right in our area here everybody wants to be associated kind of like with a celebrity so here comes jesus homeboy makes good and he came to nazareth where he had been brought up and as his custom was he went into the synagogue on the sabbath day and stood up for the reed and there was delivered unto him the book of the prophet isaiah now remember jesus didn't go looking for a book they came and delivered him the book said okay here read out of isaiah and when he had opened the book he found the place where it is written the spirit of the lord is upon me because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor he has sent me to heal the brokenhearted to preach deliverance to the captives and recovering of sight to the blind to set at liberty those that are bruised to preach the acceptable year of the lord amen and he took the book and he handed it back to the minister now just try to put yourself in this picture you're sitting in a synagogue everything's going okay the minister comes we've heard about jesus and so the minister comes and hands him the books and we'd like for you to read today and and the bible said all the eyes were fastened upon him and he closed the book and he gave it again into the minister and sat down and the eyes of what's that word again all the eyes of all them that were in the synagogue were fastened on him and he began to say unto them this day this scripture that i just read is fulfilled in your ears and all bear him witness and wondered at the gracious words which proceeded out of his mouth and they said is not this joseph's son you know what the answer is no it was not joseph's son it was god's son it was joseph's step-son and he said unto them you will surely say unto me this proverb physician heal thyself whatsoever we have heard done in capernaum do also here in our country in other words show us a miracle show us a sign we we've heard all about what you've done do it here and he said verily i say unto you no prophet is accepted in his own country now maybe some of you that are new you wonder well this message is so true and it's come from god how come so few people i mean how come you know there's there's millions of people in the baptists and millions of peop billions in the catholic church and and you've got hindus and buddhists and sikhs and jains and every kind of denomination but how come only .001 of the people in the world have received god's message for this day and jesus said no prophet is accepted in his own country you know that's the greatest indictment against our country that is going to bring divine judgment is number one we have rejected god's prophet number one number two the tens of millions of unborn children that have been killed and number three we have allowed america to become a modern sodom and gomorrah those three elements and i believe the last four years because america was good to israel i believe bought us just a few years of grace but but i believe you need to buckle your seat belt friends because things are coming fast and heavy and persecution is going to come fast and heavy and if you are not on the side of the ones that are in power you are going to become the enemy and they're going to search you out they're going to want to find out who what when where and why they'll get one of these big tech companies and they'll track you all the way back from kindergarten all the way up through grade school high school they'll track every email you've ever written they'll track every post that you've ever made they'll track your work record they'll track your credit score they will track everything about you and believe me if they want to do you harm they will do you harm now remember the devil brother jason i were talking about it last night the devil is so angry because he's got the whole world the whole world is deceived the whole world is on automatic pilot cruise control and they're just over there worshiping the god that they think is god and they're ignorantly worshipping satan he is the god of this evil age this is satan's eden this is jezebel religion and many people are doing god a service without it being his will because god's will is his word in verse 25 but i tell you the truth many widows were in israel in the days of elias when the heaven was shut up three years and six months and great famine was throughout the land but unto none of them was elias sent save unto serepta a city of sodom unto a woman that was a widow so think about that all the suffering that was going on all the starvation and god sent elijah to a widow woman and her little boy so now let's turn over to matthew 27. so jesus you know his ministry continues and and and the bible tells us if all the things that jesus said and done if they were all written all the books of the world would not be able to hold them now back in those days they didn't have libraries like we had but you know jesus was busy all day every day except when he was resting and and everywhere he went the bible said he healed them all he healed them all he healed them all he healed them all so the bible you know people say well brother branham you know he he may he he did this he did that you know when we read isaiah or jeremiah or ezra or nehemiah we read a little tiny cliff note a mind new cliff notes of their life we don't read their day-to-day life and their activities and the mistakes they made and the problems they had with their children and we don't read about all those things but in this day god chose to have the most transparent prophet in the world humanity and yet god overlaid that humanity you know the day the day that i really the day that god locked me into this message i'll never forget it i know the very hour of the very day and and brother arne brother jason knows brother arnie's sister uh uh debbie knows brother arnie and uh when i met brother arne he'd only been uh familiar with the message for about a year there was no churches and he was unsanctified to say the least but he put books in my hand and and i'm reading these books i'm reading these books i'll never forget brother jason arne you know i'm reading the church age book and i mean i'm in my glory i'm just a church age this is it this is the mother lode right here and brother arnie's saying he's saying get no seals yet i said what did you get no seals yet what he was saying was did you get in those seals yet and he would say it over and over i i don't know what a seal is a seal is a car you know something in the motor and he kept saying get in those seals get in those seals i didn't even have a sealed book i didn't even know where to go i didn't know there was one so one day as i'm struggling i'm struggling because you know i had catholic background baptist uh i i'd been to the full gospel businessmen heavily involved went to bible school and then to the upc and so i thought i knew a little bit about the bible so now i'm standing i'm struggling i'm struggling and things are coming clear and clear but that serpent seed that was the thing that all of us at one time probably if if i know if i know mostly you struggle with that and so here i am i'm struggling i'm struggling with the serpent seed and i'm struggling of whether i said if this man is a prophet and he said that's what happened that's what happened and i'm reading and i come to a part brother branham he's having a discernment line he said now sister i don't know you and you don't know me but there is one here who does know you and he does know me he said now when he and his spirit comes in me and my spirit goes away and he gives me a temporarily resurrection by my spirit and he wants to use my body and i'm so happy to loan it to him anything he can get out of it and when i heard that i understood brother jason a son of man revealing the son of man and after that you know i was bazooka proof you could you you couldn't shake me from this message you could have put a gun to my head you could have you could have put me on the rack but i knew this was true i knew god had sent the prophet now in chapter 27 of matthew verse 1 when the morning was come all al is that word all again whole bunch of them all the chief priests and elders of the people took counsel with jesus against jesus to put him to death so this is the sanhedrin council the supreme court the chief priests the elders anybody who was anybody was in this meeting and they said we got a problem look at these people that are following this guy we don't know where this guy come from and and you know it's like it's like we've had a we've had an infestation it's like it's like we've had an infestation of termites and and and they're standing against everything that we know is true and holy we stand for what moses and abraham and we stand for that and somehow we have got to get rid of this man and his followers so now we see judas betrays him then he comes back throws the money down they won't take it back he goes and hangs himself then uh pilate tries to you know well i've got barabbas here and i got jesus here i'm gonna release one which one do you want they said give us barabbas well what shall we do with jesus crucify him and pilate goes over and he gets a bowl of water he said i'm washing my hands of the blood of this innocent man and they cried out let his blood be on us and our children what a prophecy brother jason when they said that let his blood be on us and our children so now in verse 26 then release he barabbas unto them and when he had scourged jesus so the first thing jesus got was the whipping he got 39 lashes from these monster torturous roman soldiers who loved you on what they were doing they were saddest say this saddest however you say it and they had these roman lictors these roman whips and they would take those things and they had these these leather straps and lead balls sewn into them and sharp like glass or metal pieces coming out and when they would take that whip and they'd and that whip would hit the flesh and the flesh would be ripped and the flesh would come out i couldn't even imagine getting one not one but jesus got 39 lashes before before they started the torture that was just the amateur torture that they were going to do then the soldiers of the governor took jesus into the common hall and gathered unto him the whole band of soldiers so it wasn't just a couple of soldiers that are in there that were abusing jesus it was the whole ban i don't know what the whole ban was but i'm sure it was a lot and their mission was to make an example out of this man to make an example that nobody ever be able to rise up against the authority of caesar and the jews they wanted them done away because he was ruining he was ruining the the art the hierarchy of their kingdom and so these soldiers were bent on a mission already demon possessed and now they have got one and they've been given permission do it do it as hard as you can make of him the the greatest example the world has ever seen and they stripped him and put on him a scarlet robe and when they had planted a crown of thorns they put it upon his head and a reed in his right hand and now they began to mock him sarcasm they bowed the knee before him and they mocked him saying hail king of the jews and they spit upon him and took the reed and they smote him on the head so they began to beat him they already whipped them stripped them punched them now they spit upon them smote him on the head and after they had mocked him they took the robe off from him and put on his own raiment on him and led him away to crucify now these roman soldiers they were masters of torture crucifixion it was the most horrible death in the roman empire it was the the epitome of capital punishment and when those roman soldiers they did it all the time and no doubt they had thieves and robbers and murderers and when it was time for them to be crucified they had to be dragged up the hill sometimes took multiple soldiers to drag that guy up the hill and no doubt the demons in them are screaming and the guys crying out and screaming and cursing and asking for mercy and maybe they had to have a couple of soldiers hold his hand down to nail it and a couple of soul i'm talking about the regular people not jesus and maybe they had to hold another hand down as they're screaming and cursing and moving and doing everything they can because they know they're gonna die and finally they they get them fastened and they get them nailed and up they go and have you ever seen pictures of rome sometime there were time where there were hundreds of crucified people hanging on the cross but this one was different this one was jesus this is the one that claimed to be the son of god this is the one who claimed that he could take this temple and and and build it in three days he had done the miracles he had done the sign many of the people had been in the media maybe they ate the bread maybe they ate the fishes maybe they saw the blind man maybe they saw the deaf men maybe they saw the lepers because at that time you know the area where jesus circulated it was a small area and and that network that that gossip network it was going everywhere and now everybody knew that the romans and the jews had conspired and jesus was going to be crucified and the crowds came and they lined the route where they knew he was going to come and he had the drag that after all that beating and whipping he had to drag the cross then they got simon of cyrene to carry it then when jesus when they got him to the top of the hill jesus looked down at the cross and they remember all the screaming and the kicking and the cursing that went on when somebody's going to be crucified and maybe those roman soldiers laughed at it and the more they screamed probably the better they liked it because they knew they had they were going to win in the end that guy was going to get crucified no matter how hard he kicked or punched or pulled or swore he was going down and here comes jesus and jesus comes and he sees the cross and he lays down and he stretches out his hands and he waits for the nails they had never seen one like jesus come they had never seen a lamb go to the slaughter without a sound that was shocking to them now if we go back to leviticus we go back to the fine flower had to be ground every piece was the same and then the oil the frankincense no leaven no honey and salt so now you know leviticus is pointing forward and the widow woman she fulfilled part of that because she had the meal and she had the oil and she had the two sticks now jesus comes he is the bread of life that comes down from heaven and he's anointed with the oil of the holy ghost and in this sacrifice there was no leaven amen and jesus was not a honey christian he was not one of these well praise the lord brother hallelujah how's everything going you know i'm doing fine you know things are going good you know and no he was a real son of god he's a real man went he knew he was born for this purpose you know what i read first one the first time i read and uh you know the depth of predestination brother jason gave me uh the advice to read that book the sovereignty of god by arthur pink and and then i'm reading in brother branham he says now god being a savior it was necessary that he predestinate a race of people who would fall in order to give himself a reason and a purpose for being well what was god's purpose what was his reason for being it was to become a savior and so here at the cross there was the bread of life anointed with the holy ghost no leaven no honey and there was salt there and the salt was to preserve jesus christ in the end he said father you know why has thou forsaken me but he stayed and he bore the the cross he knew why he was there he knew what it was going to purchase he knew it was going to cover every sin that had been committed by all the old testament saints he knew it was going to cover every sin that would be committed by all the people that would come after his death and so he went there as a lamb now remember in the beginning in leviticus we talked about you know that the the it could be cooked in the oven and it could be cooked in the pan or it could be cooked in the frying pan well during jesus life you know a pan and a frying pan is totally different than an oven in an oven you know heat is applied maybe you're baking a cake or baking some bread and gradually you know the heat begins to expand well when jesus was on the earth he was carrying all these burdens with inside of him nobody really knew and so all these burdens they were in the oven but then when they came after him and they grabbed them in gethsemane and they began to push him around and they began to beat him and they and and they whipped them now it's like he's in the pan now everybody's can see the effects of what's happening to this meal offering he's being whipped and the blood is coming everywhere but then when he got on the cross when he got on that cross now he was naked they say he had a cloth around him no he was naked they were making a mockery of him an example of him the bible said his visage was marred more than any you could not even recognize who he was by the time he got to the cross he looked like a piece of meat a piece of red meat that was on that cross and then we read down a little bit further in verse 34 and they crucified him and parted his garments casting lots that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet they parted my garments among them and upon my vesture they shall cast lots and sitting down and watched him there i don't know how many was there brother jason i imagine hundreds maybe thousands were surrounding the area there looking at what was going to happen the miracle the miracle worker and now the one well is he going to do one more miracle is he going to escape from the jews is he going to escape from rome if he does we want to be an eyewitness because we've seen the other miracles before and they were real and we we can hardly believe that this is going to be the end of this great miracle worker think of his followers think of the apostles think of his mother think of mary magdalene martha and mary all the ones that loved him and followed him and they're saying this this can't be happening how is this how is this even possible and now we see that there's two thieves on the cross now i've talked to some people and they say well there was a good thief and a bad thief no they were both thieves and by the law they were getting what the law required to be crucified and there they are they're being crucified one on the right and one on the left and all the people down below the chief priests and the elders they're mocking and cursing and swearing and the ones that are on the cross they're doing the same thing the bible said they were casting it in jesus teeth [Music] but then something happened the thief on the right i believe that he was the first one to ever experience the third pull because he never heard a message he never saw a miracle but something happened to him and he went from cursing he went from swearing and casting in his teeth to saying saying lord remember me he's just a few minutes from death friends remember me when you come into your kingdom and jesus in his agony he said this day you will be with me in paradise and we wonder we wonder who we wonder who can be saved we wonder how far down the road they've gone and yet they're the they're beyond redemption so now in the in the same chapter coming down to the end now in verse 45 now from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the land unto the ninth hour so for three hours jesus was on the cross and it got real real dark in about the ninth hour jesus cried with a loud voice saying eli eli lama sabachthani that is to say my god my god why hast thou forsaken me and some of them that stood there when they heard this said this man calleth for elias and straight away one of them ran and took the sponge and filled it with vinegar and put it on a reed and gave him the drink the rest said let's see let us see whether elias will come to save him and jesus when he cried again with a loud voice yielded up the ghost jesus gave his life you can't kill god if jesus wanted to he could have stayed on that cross all day or for a week or for a month or for a year they couldn't kill god you can't kill god but jesus yielded up the he yielded up his spirit he cried father it is finished and here's what happened and behold the veil of the temple was rent and twain from the top to the bottom and the earth did quake big earthquake right at the time of the crucifixion of the meal offering and the rocks rent and the graves were opened you're not going to hear this preached in any denominational church friends and the graves were open and many bodies of the saints which slept arose and came out of the graves after his resurrection and went into this the holy city and appeared unto many now i've asked theologians i said what happened here after the resurrection who are these ones that came up and how did they go into the holy city how did they travel around how did they appear to many people you won't hear that outside of the message but brother branham said because he saw it in a vision he said well abraham and sarah walked up to jesus and said would it be okay if we kind of took a whistle-stop tour around jerusalem and see how things have changed since we've been here and sure you just go ahead and they could appear and they could disappear just like jesus could so now leviticus meal oil no leaven no honey salt as a preservative either in the oven or the pan or the frying pan but there's one ingredient that we just left out and that was the ingredients of frankincense and remember the secret of frankincense is it's only released when heat is applied to it and there on the cross jesus is in the frying pan there in the hottest most torturous moments of his life this frankincense is released he said father forgive them they don't know what they're doing you imagine the lamb of god and remember it started with leviticus picked up with the little widow woman this is a supernatural book it's a mystical book revelation is a supernatural multiplication of inspiration and revelation for communication with god the bible said those who diligently search after me they will find me and you'll find him in every book of the bible you find him in type you find him in shadow you find him in in punishment you find him in grace you find him in love you find him all different way you find him in david and all david's false and how we come back you'll find him in solomon and all his glory and then how he fell and come back you find him in samson you find him in all the great men of god you find him in in saul who became paul you find him in peter who denied the lord three times and cursed while he did so you find him in all the bible it's grace redemption love so now let's talk about you and me in romans 12 paul says i beseech thee by the mercies of god that you present your body a living sacrifice holy acceptable unto god which is your reasonable service now reasonable service that means that's the minimum that's the minimum you should do is to present your body in other words lord here i am here's my body in other words right here this here this this flesh here this is our meal this is that fine flour that leviticus is talking about and then this meal it's got to be ground down the burr has got to take it until it's jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever and the oil of the holy ghost has got to come and it's got to overlay this flesh so now you've got the meal and the oil then you got to get rid of the leaven get rid of the world get rid of anything that god if god was standing next to you anything that you would do that god would not accept get rid of it don't if it's gray area get rid of it you want everything to be right and holy and true you know first thing in the morning when i wake up there's got to be two deaths i gotta die and the devil's gonna die first thing in the morning bind that yapping dog don't even let them get started don't even let them put you on the stress express and get up late and hit the snooze button over and over and over and you're running around putting your clothes on getting in the car and speeding down the road and one of these nice beaufort police officers wants to visit with you and he wants to give you a little note i know i'm in beaufort when i see those lights brother jason and i slow down when i come to beaufort i slow down see and so your meal your flesh presented as a living sacrifice holy acceptable unto god which is your reasonable service now the holy ghost has got to come down and the holy ghost has got to fill up every particle of your life every fabric fabric that that you are made of needs to be anointed and fulfilled with the word of god and the presence of god and the love of god in your heart no leaven what's the other one get rid of that silly christianity oh praise the lord brother you know glory to god hallelujah yeah everything's good you know yeah yeah yeah yeah you know you know how brother breath brother branham said now you know he said no everybody's a blessing someone they come and someone they go he said it right out he said now everybody creates atmosphere he said now some people they create an atmosphere and you just love to be in that atmosphere i look forward to coming and being with brother jason and his family i love i used to love coming in in the presence of brother eddie watkins and gene and their family it was such a welcoming warm it was like a warm blanket just just dropped on you and you just felt just exactly right but i've been around other people boy when they come around you it's gossip complaining cynicism skepticism sarcasm anger fear all those things and they're manifesting it right in front of you because every one of us we are a supernatural being and when i come in contact with somebody if they're not a believer they're still a spiritual being they might be anointed with the unholy spirit but they're a spiritual being i'm a supernatural being and if my spirit and their spirit if it clashes then i see you wouldn't want to be you and and down the road you go and then there has to be salt because the salt is the preservative spoken about in leviticus now in this day do we have ahab and jezebel on the scene in this day like no other day i think everybody can agree with that because of who they are and what they're doing is there a famine in the land for the hearing of the true word of god yes and elijah called that famine in 1957 he said if america doesn't accept it this year she's finished finished one coming here one coming there you know a little speck here a little speck a little we're looking for them all the time but they become fewer and fewer in between so elijah's come he's called for a famine and then there's a little widow woman in the land a little widow woman like me like you with all my religious training and all the religious leaven i had inside of me still i was like a spiritual skeleton walking down the road i had no idea about church ages and seals and predestination and adoption and election and beyond the curtain of time and i could name a hundred other things that i didn't know so here i am a skeleton walking down the road and i come across elijah and elijah he begins to pack those pounds pack those pounds on me the more that i read the more that i listened the more that i talked you know and the muscle started getting greater and the mind started getting sharper and that super sense that sixth sense it began to be focused and now i i would say it is every once in a while i'll miss some or i meet somebody and i'll say uh i don't know about that guy but usually it's right on point you know that that super sense that discernment now what's the next thing that has to happen you're going to go through trials maybe maybe even right now maybe you're going through some trials like jesus but they're in the oven nobody but you knows about it and you're carrying around that burden and and it's just like an oven experience it's a burden it's a of an experience or maybe maybe a little later you know it comes out in the open and maybe a few more people know about it and you talk to your pastor and talk to a few of your friends and people know oh you know what brother so-and-so is going through sister so and so and it becomes like a pan experience everybody's looking in the pan and when you when you come on the scene everybody's looking yeah oh poor brother so and so hell we need to pray for that brother you become an object people's eyes are fastened to you their mind is fastened to you they know a little bit about your trial but oh boy when that trial gets out of it gets off the rails so to speak maybe one of your children backslides or maybe you backslide or maybe one of your children plays a fool winds up in jail or wines all kinds of crazy things happen now that's a frying pan experience and now you're there in that pan and everybody knows about it it's bad and then like jesus on the frying pan experience you take your cross and you lay down and you become that living sacrifice holy acceptable unto god which is your reasonable service and remember on the cross in jesus hottest trial the frankincense kicked in the sweetest aroma was released from his greatest trial and how many of us have gone through things and say i would never want to go through that again but i'm so thankful i did go through it because i learned and i grew and i got closer to god and i realized that i am not in control that god is in control last scripture we're going to go to thessalonians 1st thessalonians 4. now remember all those ingredients the meal the oil no leaven no honey salt frankincense the women picks it up then jesus comes and he becomes the epitome of the living sacrifice and then here we are ahab jezebel is on the scene like never before brother jason i were talking about it you know to me it's like a neon strobe light what's going on it's time to buckle our seat belts like never before it's time to watch and wait and listen and be aware it's good you know when when the children of israel when they were getting ready for the passover they were ready they were ready to move at the call of moses last verse first thessalonians 4 13 but i would not have you to be ignorant brethren concerning them which are asleep that ye sorrow not even as others which have no hope you know friends i i've i've lost family and friends when i was a catholic i went to a lot of funerals when i was a catholic and i mean it's like i mean it's like mourning and sobbing and weeping and people falling all over the casket and wanting to climb in the casket i mean it's it's wild because all those people can think of my poor husband my poor wife my poor son my they're in purgatory now and they're suffering and they're burning no no catholic goes right the bible says to us to be absent from the body is to be present with the lord it's not them it's not they are we they are wailing weeping and wailing but paul says we don't sorrow as others which have no hope for if ye believe that jesus rose again even so them which sleep in jesus will god bring with him for this say we unto you by the word of the lord that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the lord shall not prevent them which are asleep for the lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout with the voice of the archangel with the trump of god and the dead in christ shall rise first then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the lord in the air and so shall we ever be with the lord wherefore comfort ye one another with these thoughts now my last thought my bible's closed my last thought is this rapture that we're all looking forward to expecting i've been expecting it for a long long time and perhaps if time goes on i won't i won't experience it but you young people you have got a lot better chance of receiving that rapture than i do or those of us who have some years upon them i'm hoping he comes soon but i know one thing that rapture is not going to come until the last seed comes in and comes to perfection think about that friends now they might not have all the messages read but their faith their faith will come to perfection and so what god is waiting for now is for the meal offering you me the bride around the world he's waiting for us to pick up our cross to become that living sacrifice holy acceptable unto god which is our reasonable service let's stand father we thank you for this day that you have given to us we thank you for this road map of your scripture that you have outlined you are the divine architect you do everything perfectly and a prophet of god says i have laid it out you brothers go in and dig it out by the grace of god once in a while we really hit the honeypot and for me this message has hit the honeypot like very few that i've ever seen to see it all the way from leviticus all the way to the day that you and i are living in and the manifestation of the events that are taking place all around the world and today like in the days of ahab and jezebel there is a super famine in the land for the hearing of the true word of god prophet of god said in 1954 64. if time goes on for 50 years the whole world will be in total insanity i didn't know if i was going to do this but i'm gonna take two minutes if you don't mind i always get a kick out of pastors when they say can i have five more minutes can i have ten more minutes i'm waiting for somebody to jump up and say no you've had enough but i'm just asking for a few more minutes not to break the sacredness of the atmosphere but as a result of everything that i've read and know one time i was flying on a plane and sometime these planes to india or africa or all over asia they're long flights and i had remembered brother branham had a track it was pick up your pen and write and so i said i'm just going to i'm going to think about all the things that i would not know if i was not in the message and so i began to write them down and i just want to share them with you i timed it it's going to take two minutes okay if it had not been for this message we would not know that it had never rained before noah we would not know that abraham and sarah would change back to a young man and a young woman we'd not know that king saul was saved or the rich young ruler's ultimate end was in hell we would not know that hell is not eternal we would not understand baptism godhead we would not understand the rapture the changing who the two witnesses were who the 144 000 are who the souls under the altar were we'd not understand church ages seals serpent seed we'd not be able to measure the future home of the heavenly bride the heavenly bridegroom and the earthly bride excuse me we not understand the antichrist the false prophet the beast the the number the name the mark the image the harlot we not understand the seven dimensions that's a lot that's a lot that nobody would know you know this message is spoken in a language that it takes the token to understand it i call it supernatural linguistics we would not understand adoption predestination statue of a perfect man marriage and divorce anointed ones at the end time satan's eden the god of this evil age jezebel religion doing god a service without it being his will we wouldn't understand the third pull and so as a result of that who are we well we're new creatures in christ we're to be the happiest people on earth we're attributes of god thoughts of god offspring of god genes and sperms of god where god's victory over satan in this generation were overcomers of the name the number the mark the image the beast the harlots deception sin and the world we are a new species we are supernatural and of a divine order we're sons and daughters of the king mystics in a mystical body the elite of god the super church a super race of people you're the highest form of life on earth recipients of divine love and grace your king's kids a chosen generation a royal priesthood a holy nation a peculiar people the voice of god in this generation the apple of his eye the heartbeat of god trophies of his grace beneficiaries of his resurrection beneficiaries of eternal life living sacrifices tabernacles of the living god sanctified ones the light of the world the salt of the earth god's inheritance angels messiahs little lights resurrected ones ambassadors of christ angels of light you're a spiritual dynamo the spirit of christ now resides in you it rotated off of christ and now resides in you you're a millennium man and a millennium woman if you're ever going to be a millennium man or a millennial woman you're going to be part of the bride of jesus christ because the rest of them they're going to be engraved during that millennium we're the true anointed ones at the end times unshakable indestructible bold brave unmovable courageous committed biologically a unique creation we have god's dna inside of us god's genetic code we are nursing from the breast of el shaddai we're a colony from heaven a community of believers aliens pilgrims strangers we are the revival we are prisoners of love christ the word and the message we are super sensitive to the supernatural we are the most contagious people on earth the most infectious people on earth the most spontaneous people on earth we're a product of divine engineering a product of spiritual evolution we're seated in dwelling in heavenly places we are involved in a divine romance we are a part of a divine spiritual supernatural aristocracy let that one drop in real good forget about the so-called royal families over in europe you are part of the divine royal spiritual supernatural aristocracy the breath of god dwells in you and lastly so we talked about how would we know and then who we are but the last one it's only one page it's what we have in christ we have the seed of perfect love and perfect faith in us the seed of supernatural strength and stamina you've received a divine blood transfusion a heart transplant a mind transplant literally a life transplant you have the ability to prosper and thrive in the realms of the supernatural you have supernatural marching orders you have a passion to know and serve god you have a magnificent obsession to know christ and finally you have a supernatural passport into the next realm let's bow our heads once more father i know this has been a little long and i pray that those that are here have identified who they are and and what their mission in life is and that is to have their hearts turned back to the faith of our fathers and like paul paul everything he went through lord and at the end he said this light affliction worketh for me a far greater reward in glory father you put saul uh paul through so many things but he knew who he was serving he knew he was tapped into the next realm and nothing they could do in this realm could separate him from from knowing who he was in you and i trust that will be the same revelation that some of my brothers and sisters will have today and finally before jason comes if you're here today and you would say my prayer from this day forward is i want to renew my commitment or make a commitment that i from this day onward am going to be that living sacrifice i'm going to take this meal i'm gonna let the holy ghost lead me i'm getting rid of all the leaven getting rid of all the honey and the salt that's gonna preserve me and i'm getting on my cross and i'm going to have the sweetest life the sweetest presents the sweetest words the sweetest motives the sweetest goals and ambitions come out of me than has ever been in my entire life if that's your prayer would you lift your hand and say lord help me and we can't do that alone friends we have to lay at the cross and he can do it for us he can do that transformation let's sing that song created me a clean heart i'll sing one verse and ask brother jason to come [Music] [Music] [Music] create lord o create in me a clean heart we're going to lower that we're going to lower that down we're going to lower that it's going to be too hot amen hey matt matt let me make my comments first amen do you enjoy that today you know i i love a journey through the scriptures like that it it takes my breath away because when you see somebody can start in leviticus to me the book of leviticus is the gospels of the old testament matthew mark luke and john because leviticus i mean all the old testament is but leviticus particularly because it lays out the priesthood of christ and how how he's going to live and what he's going to be in the sacrifice that he's going to be and when you can see how it was supposed to be in the pattern in leviticus and then you go to first kings and you see elijah following that pattern and then you jump you know now you're jumping from leviticus probably 15 centuries and you see here comes jesus and he's walking exactly like elijah exactly like the book of leviticus and then you take another 2 000 year leap from there and you come to our day and you go wow i get it bang bang bang bang here oh it's me right that was for this amen that's what paul said that's what that was for so that you right now you are the ones upon whom the ends of the world have come amen and i i thought about how that you know that frankincense doesn't begin to be activated until the heat and i tell you this world brings some heat doesn't it friends the trials and afflictions that we face and you know if we're to be that living sacrifice it has to come and i thought that was an amazing statement brother and i never thought about that i've thought about it but never heard it never thought of the way you said it that israel had never seen a lamb sacrificed quietly they had never seen a lamb come to the sacrifice and not make a sound what a what a fulfillment how much greater the lamb of god was than all the millions of lambs that had ever been slain and you know the heat and the trials and the things that we're going through right now you know if i look back on the astonishment as brother ernie drew the picture for us and all those perhaps hundreds wouldn't surprise him at all to see it as hundreds because he was famous throughout judea and is he gonna we've seen all these miracles this is the guy who created fish and bread and loaves and this guy who walked on the water this guy who raised the dead we're gonna see surely he's gonna get out of this and it looked like the greatest defeat in the world and it's so astonished everybody it even astonished his disciples to where peter just didn't even know what to do and he just looks at the crowd and says i don't know i just go i'm going back to work i can't even make sense of what we just saw cleopas on the road to emmaus and they're downcast they're exactly the opposite of what they ought to have been and it took jesus coming out and revealing himself to say i want this to have happened i'm here to say something friends i know that the heat and the trials are hot but i would say to you today ought not it to be this way [Music] should we have our heads hung down or should we be looking up if we can see it in leviticus and we can see it in in elijah and we can see it in christ and now it's upon us come on friends we're almost home yes my those patterns can't fail we're almost home and i just say wow that was that was a bit of all right as the brits would say this morning let's sing something the day before yesterday crucified my lord beat him unmercifully they beat him on mercifully and then nailed him to a tree the sky grew dark and the earth began to fall think about that scene the people cried surely we've crucified the son of god think about our day now why didn't we recognize the mighty god was here today [Music] is that a fair question shouldn't we have no shouldn't we have no wish we had known before the lord had come and gone amen let me read this here it's a prayer prayer request comes in pray for my cousin christopher khali i suppose clay [Music] okay all right goodness gracious i want you to bow your heads we'll take this prayer request to the lord before we go you know as brother matt is singing shouldn't we have recognized him it's easy friends all heads bowed now it's real easy to stand back as a believer and look at the world that didn't recognize him and and and almost ask incredibly incredulously shouldn't you have recognized him well what about you and i shouldn't we also recognize his authority in our lives in his word to be the lord of our lives would we stand back in judgment of the world when we ourselves have not allowed him to become lord and master of our own lives shouldn't we have known shouldn't we recognize shouldn't you see yourself in the pattern of the scripture today it's one thing to talk about as brother ernie demonstrated it's one thing to talk about jesus laying back on that cross but our but the real message today was are you able to do that i mean leviticus is great first kings is great the gospel story is great but now what about you what shall i do with jesus called the christ this is your hour to shine this is your hour to believe this is your hour to say this is the son of god and i intend to follow him you want to raise up a hand to the lord today and say father i want to please help me to become aware of my moment in this story amen lord hands up everywhere across the building i have no doubt hands up across the those connected by stream and lord we want to just raise up not only our hands but our whole hearts to you today lord let this message today let it become a reality in my life let it live in me lord it's not just information we didn't come here today just to gather information we came here to compare your word to our lives father there's there's only one thing that needs changing when that happens and it sure ain't the word our lives are always the ones that need adjusted so i pray you help us today lord shouldn't we have known shouldn't the world have known well shouldn't we have known also yes that god should have the lordship of our life right here at the finish line right here at the crossing over right here in the closing scenes of earth's history the last scenes of fallen man in the earth getting ready to change to a new millennial world this one's going to fade away god's gonna take away his hand of protection gonna pull the bride up out of the earth amen and the earth will spin off and lord destroy itself you'll start it again father help us today to be aware of that may we pinch ourselves and realize the immediacy of the moment an hour that we live in i commit these hands that went up into your hands we commit this need for this young man lord here's a how fortunate for this young man he just happens to have been born in the world and a cousin to one of your sons how fortunate this man don't even realize lord here he's got a cousin in a church hundreds of miles away asking a church can we intercede on be on his behalf we're willing lord we're more than willing help this poor man lord reveal yourself to him let him see the love of god in this in this tragedy bring him to know you in a greater way lord we join our faith with brother brad you'll join your faith to our faith you'll push this promise through help us today lord to see the reality of your word in our lives i want to see that more than anything i realize lord that i am my own greatest hindrance in letting the word come forth so i'm praying today lord that you'll give us strength to surrender ourselves that we become the living image of the very lesson that we sing today in god's word we asked you to give us a lesson and you did so now may we take it from here and put wheels to it may it become something in our lives we're becoming something so i commit it to you in jesus name amen we're gonna let you go and just keep keep that need in your in your heart because unless the lord you know brother brad finds out the lord touched him by a miracle he's gonna need prayer for a while you don't get hurt that badly and it's just over in a moment we've got other needs that we've been praying for i want to continue to pray for him amen and pray for brother ernie he's here on the east coast making a big tour i want the lord to anoint anointing mightily amen we sure love him here feels like he feels like home folk to us amen and so uh we're happy to have him here today he's gonna be here for another day i'm gonna get to fellowship him quite a bit tomorrow so i'm looking forward to that but it's been good to be in the house of god we're going to have him in the fellowship hall for all of you all to uh drain him dry amen amen come on out there and fellowship him and he'll give you some of that that extra juice that he carries around all the time and may make you feel on top of the world but brother ernie has a way of making you feel like you're the most special person in the planet earth and i love that about him so we'll have him we're going to go get some grub bring back feed him and fellowship him and fill him up full of coffee and i think there was some sweets left over amen if my grandkids didn't get in and eat them all and so amen we love you thank you for coming out today amen turn around with those your family near you with your family shake hands greet them in the name of the lord wave at everybody else amen god bless you you're dismissed in jesus name today of friend and i walked down the road we didn't know our lord but then a man drew near and he spoke words so wide
