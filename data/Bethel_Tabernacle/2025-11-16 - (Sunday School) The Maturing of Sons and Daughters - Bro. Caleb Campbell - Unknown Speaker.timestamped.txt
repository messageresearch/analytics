[2:04] God bless you this morning.
[2:07] Let's we just stand. Uh we're going to
[2:10] do scripture and then we're going to
[2:14] turn to the Lord in prayer.
[2:17] First Corinthians chapter 3 and vers 16.
[2:21] If you want to Turn in your Bibles with
[2:22] me this morning. 1 Corinthians 3
[2:27] and verses 16. We're going to just read
[2:29] two verses.
[2:33] It's a familiar text. It says that know
[2:35] ye not that ye are the temple of God and
[2:39] that the spirit of God dwelleth in you?
[2:43] If any man defile the temple of God, him
[2:46] shall God destroy. For the temple of God
[2:48] is holy, which temple ye are. Let no man
[2:52] deceive himself. If any man man among
[2:55] you seemth to be wise in this world, let
[2:57] him become a fool that he may be wise.
[3:00] For the wisdom of this world is
[3:02] foolishness with God.
[3:03] &gt;&gt; For it is written, he taketh the wise in
[3:07] their own craftiness. And again the Lord
[3:10] knoweth the thoughts of the wise, and
[3:12] that they are vain. Therefore, let no
[3:14] man glory in men, for all things are
[3:16] yours, whether Paul or Apollos or Cphus
[3:19] or the world or life or death or things
[3:21] present or things to come. All are
[3:23] yours. And ye are Christ's and Christ is
[3:26] God's. Let's just go before the Lord.
[3:28] Heavenly Father, we just want to thank
[3:30] you for the reading of your word this
[3:31] morning. Lord, we just pray that you'd
[3:33] help us open up the word, Father. And we
[3:36] just want to quiet ourselves, Lord. So
[3:37] often times, Lord, I'm guilty of Lord
[3:40] just getting a little bit nervous and
[3:41] just going too fast. Lord, I just was
[3:43] listening to your prophet talk about
[3:45] that, Father. And he how often times he
[3:47] would just calm himself down, calm his
[3:50] nerves, Lord, so that you could come in
[3:51] and speak to the people, Father. Just
[3:53] calm us down tonight, Father, this
[3:55] morning. And help us, Lord. We love you,
[3:57] Father. We're just here to hear from
[3:58] you, Lord. May you just be with the
[4:00] entirety of the service. We commit it to
[4:02] you in Jesus name. Amen. God bless you
[4:05] &gt;&gt; as you take your seats this morning.
[4:07] This isn't really a part two so much,
[4:09] but it is kind of an extension of a
[4:11] thought I took several weeks ago. Um,
[4:14] I'm going to just title it the maturing
[4:15] of sons and daughters this morning. A
[4:18] few statements I ended with uh last time
[4:20] I thought that were they were worth
[4:22] repeating. And you know, so the first
[4:24] effect of sin in our lives is always to
[4:27] make us try and hide what we are. Sin
[4:30] always involves us being unreal or
[4:34] pretending. And then we brought that
[4:36] word out, duplicity, which is being
[4:38] deceitful or being two-faced. You know,
[4:41] acting one way when you're at church or
[4:43] maybe another way when you're at work,
[4:45] you know, and we ask ourselves the
[4:47] question, are we the same believer or
[4:49] are we the same believer that we claim
[4:51] to be at church at home and in our
[4:53] private lives and in our thought lives?
[4:56] And I wanted to stop and touch on this
[4:58] for a minute. Um, there's a few
[5:00] directions that this can take us. And
[5:02] we're going to catch some quotes here
[5:04] this morning from a sermon Brother
[5:06] Brandham, we're familiar with, Brother
[5:07] Brandham teaches on the stature of a
[5:09] perfect man to help us drive this point
[5:12] down. But there is a maturing process
[5:14] that does take place in the life of
[5:17] believers. Amen. When we're born again.
[5:20] um to bring a natural uh example in. Uh
[5:23] my wife and I, we've we've talked
[5:25] several times about kind of the the
[5:27] developmental process of of babies and
[5:29] children as they grow. And
[5:31] &gt;&gt; I was just thinking back about a year,
[5:32] maybe maybe a year or two ago, I was
[5:34] trying to get my daughter to hold a fork
[5:37] or a spoon a certain way. And I was
[5:39] showing her how to do it, and then I was
[5:42] placing it in her hand to do it.
[5:59] drawing, you know, they hold it with
[6:00] like a fist. If you've ever seen it,
[6:02] they don't actually have that ability to
[6:04] do that. You can try to force them to,
[6:06] and they may be able to pick it up for a
[6:08] time, but they're not able to do it the
[6:10] way that someone with more fine motor
[6:13] skills are able to do it. And so they
[6:16] don't have the coordination, right? So,
[6:18] so most of the time when they when they
[6:20] grab it, they they want to do it. You
[6:21] know, you're supposed to mimic it. So,
[6:23] they want to do it and they end up kind
[6:25] of awkwardly holding it like a fist and,
[6:27] you know, kind of doing it like this. Or
[6:29] when they're drawing, they kind of draw
[6:31] like this. And as a parent, you have to
[6:33] recognize what stage your child is in,
[6:36] right? Because, you know, they may just
[6:38] not have that motor skill developed yet.
[6:40] And that's okay. You know that one day
[6:42] that they will. And so you have to be
[6:44] patient in that process. You have to be
[6:47] understanding to know I am going to
[6:49] continue to teach and I'm going to
[6:51] continue to train, but they may not be
[6:54] where you you think they should be yet
[6:56] or they may not be where they need to be
[6:59] or they just may not be to that place
[7:01] yet. Um [snorts]
[7:03] it ties into a scripture uh that talks
[7:05] about in Hebrews it talks about eating,
[7:07] you know, the strong meat of the word
[7:08] versus being babies and eating the milk
[7:11] of the word. And it's it's important to
[7:12] remember each stage is vital to
[7:15] development spir, you know, speaking
[7:17] kind of naturally and spiritually. You
[7:19] can't you can't skip the milk stage for
[7:22] babies. There's certain nutrients,
[7:24] right, that they need in milk in order
[7:26] to grow vitamins and and minerals. Their
[7:29] digestive system isn't completely ready
[7:32] to handle more solid foods yet. So for a
[7:34] time they drink milk and then as they
[7:37] get a little bit older you begin to
[7:39] start introducing foods into their diet
[7:41] and of course usually you start off
[7:43] simple right you you teach them the
[7:45] concept of eating because at first it's
[7:48] a very foreign thing to them you know
[7:50] just just think you know when we are
[7:53] being trained in something that we have
[7:55] absolutely no idea have never seen it or
[7:57] heard it or done it is a foreign concept
[8:00] to us you know and I was thinking about
[8:02] when I was in I was in paramedic school,
[8:04] they would teach us a concept of, you
[8:06] know, you'd sit in class and you'd learn
[8:09] how you were to do a certain thing. You
[8:10] know, you this is how you put an IV into
[8:13] a vein. This is how far you you you need
[8:16] to put the needle. This is this is a
[8:18] certain medication. This is that. And
[8:20] so, you'd have the concept of it, right?
[8:23] But then there would be the application
[8:24] process. So, and that's that's an
[8:27] important note. I I going to get to that
[8:29] in a few minutes. But you know, there's
[8:31] the concept and then there's
[8:32] application. Um, but when when they're
[8:37] used to doing a certain thing, when
[8:39] they're used to drinking milk, it it
[8:42] doesn't take long for them to realize
[8:44] what food is and how to eat it. You
[8:46] know, usually you start off as a baby,
[8:48] you start off with kind of more handheld
[8:49] foods and introduce it. And I was
[8:52] looking on Google. These are just some
[8:54] rough averages from Google because every
[8:55] kid is different. But between between
[8:58] the ages of one and two, babies can
[9:00] begin feeding themselves with a spoon.
[9:02] Right? So it might be a mess and it
[9:04] usually I I think brother Jason made a
[9:07] point like this. It usually gets all
[9:08] over the place, but the point is is that
[9:12] they are able to start eating the same
[9:14] kind of foods that you are eating and
[9:16] you're you need to start introducing
[9:18] those things to them, right? and just
[9:20] thinking spiritually this morning, you
[9:22] know, because it's not to sound
[9:24] demeaning or derogatory to call to call
[9:27] someone a spiritual baby. Now, if
[9:29] they're spiritual babies for a long
[9:31] time, then, you know, we need to figure
[9:34] out what where the where the disconnect
[9:36] is, but everybody is a spiritual baby at
[9:38] some point in their life. You have to
[9:40] have the milk of the word in order to
[9:44] allow the digestive system spiritually
[9:46] speaking to increase and to be able to
[9:49] take the word and eat the word. When it
[9:51] when the Bible says take the word, eat
[9:53] the book, there has to be a process in
[9:56] that. Um, you know, but everybody has
[9:59] that time. And you know, and when the
[10:01] word is transforming their lives and the
[10:04] process of it, we're going to read some
[10:05] quotes in a minute. And the process of
[10:07] it, if the if the process is done right,
[10:09] it it comes from the inside out, right?
[10:12] So when we're born again of the spirit
[10:14] of God, then he starts transforming our
[10:17] lives from the inside out. That's how
[10:20] the process is supposed to work. We're
[10:22] we're we're born again. The Lord comes
[10:24] in, lives in us, and then he is able to
[10:27] train us and teach us. And we'll go
[10:29] through stages. Um, but you just have to
[10:31] and some sometimes you have to have you
[10:33] have to have grace for people and
[10:34] discernment to know what stage they're
[10:36] in. Amen. Um, because it's our job as
[10:40] the body of Christ. It's our job to pray
[10:42] for them, to encourage them, to help
[10:46] them along the road. Amen. Just because
[10:48] they may not be in the same place
[10:50] spiritually as you are, they one day
[10:53] they they they'll get there. God has a
[10:55] plan for them to get there. Amen. And
[10:57] so, what is our job to do? Our job is to
[11:00] pray for them. Our job is to not focus
[11:02] on a fault if they fall down or if they
[11:04] make a mistake. Our job is not to say,
[11:06] "Well, you know, I I knew you were going
[11:08] to do that because I saw the road you're
[11:10] going to do." That's not going to help
[11:11] anybody. You pray for that person and
[11:14] you encourage them. And when they even
[11:16] when they come, I just was thinking
[11:17] about this the other night, um last
[11:21] night specifically actually. And when
[11:23] when somebody has new experiences in the
[11:27] Lord, everything is fresh. everything is
[11:28] new. And maybe when they'll come to you
[11:30] and they'll they'll have something
[11:31] exciting or or they'll, you know,
[11:33] they'll say, "The Lord is really dealing
[11:34] with me in this way or, you know, the
[11:36] Lord has has convicted me here or done
[11:38] this." Don't don't be derogatory to
[11:41] them. Don't say, "Well, you know, you
[11:42] you need to get a little further down
[11:43] the road." No, encourage them. That's an
[11:45] awesome thing. Praise the Lord. That is
[11:47] that is great. God is going to take them
[11:49] through those stages. And we can't let
[11:52] them skip the milk of the word. You try
[11:54] to feed steak to a baby, they just can't
[11:56] digest it. But it doesn't mean that one
[11:58] day they won't digest it. If that makes
[12:00] sense [snorts]
[12:01] &gt;&gt; because God is God is obviously doing a
[12:04] work in their life. And sometimes it
[12:05] does take a little time. And I'm gonna
[12:06] I'm going to take uh several approaches
[12:08] here because because we have to have um
[12:11] we have to have balance there. But I
[12:14] want to read these quotes and I'll show
[12:15] you why here in a few minutes. Brother
[12:16] Benham says in the stature of a perfect
[12:18] man 1962 vers or paragraph 346 he says
[12:22] now that is the house that God dwells in
[12:26] not a building with a big bell on top of
[12:28] it and a high steeple. See a body thou
[12:30] hast prepared me a body that God can
[12:33] dwell in. God can walk in God can see
[12:36] in. God can talk in. God can work in.
[12:39] Amen. The living instrumentality of God.
[12:43] God walking on two feet in you. Glory.
[12:46] The footsteps of the Lord are uh the
[12:48] footsteps of the righteous is ordered of
[12:50] God. God is walking in you. For ye are
[12:53] written epistles read of all men. And if
[12:56] the life that's in Christ be in you,
[12:59] you'll bear the life that Christ bore.
[13:03] Right? In the power of transformation,
[13:06] he says, "Let the Holy Spirit come upon
[13:07] any person that's truly got something
[13:10] down there. A healing comes from the
[13:11] inside. Let the healing come from the
[13:13] spirit that's in you. If it's a genuine
[13:15] spirit anointing
[13:17] anointing the genuine seed, it can't do
[13:20] nothing but bear a son or daughter of
[13:23] God. But the genuine spirit can come
[13:26] upon a cocklebird seed. The rain can
[13:28] fall upon a cocklebird and it will make
[13:30] it live just the same as when it falls
[13:32] on the wheat and makes it live. But by
[13:34] their fruits you know them. Brother
[13:37] Brandham says, "See, we're a fruit tree
[13:39] of God bearing his word." Right? So
[13:42] we're a fruit tree and we're bearing his
[13:44] word. Jesus said, "Let a man deny
[13:47] himself and follow me. Let him deny his
[13:49] education, his knowledge, his degrees.
[13:51] Take up his cross and follow me." And he
[13:53] says, "Look at you in here. How how many
[13:55] has had that experience?" Everyone.
[13:57] We've we've had that experience because
[13:59] it was spoke. It was believed. And the
[14:01] word came forth and fell into the bed of
[14:03] the heart and there it growed right out
[14:05] of it. See, and it's this is this is a
[14:08] good point. He says, "Transforming
[14:10] yourself, his holy spirit transforms the
[14:14] seed word into his likeness." Like if a
[14:18] pear tree brings forth a pear, an apple
[14:20] tree, an apple, things like that. His
[14:22] word will bring forth sons and daughters
[14:27] of God. That's what it's supposed to do.
[14:30] So if it's a genuine word falling on a
[14:33] genuine seed, it will produce genuine
[14:36] fruits of the spirit. Amen.
[14:39] &gt;&gt; Um so if you have that genuine
[14:40] experience and that life is now in you,
[14:43] you know, and he says this in the statue
[14:44] of a perfect man, go listen to that
[14:46] sermon. It's so good. I'm still
[14:48] listening to it. Uh but it's so good.
[14:50] And we're going to between this one and
[14:52] the next Sunday school, we're going to
[14:53] touch on a lot of points. But he says
[14:54] the the first step, the very foundation
[14:57] is having faith and being born again.
[15:00] And being born again, he says, actually
[15:02] produces the faith to believe the word.
[15:06] And then after you get the faith, only
[15:09] then, these are direct quotes, only then
[15:11] you're actually in a position to grow.
[15:14] Amen. So that's the foundation. Then
[15:17] you're in a position that you can grow.
[15:19] Amen.
[15:20] &gt;&gt; And if you're born again, the the life
[15:22] that you're living should manifest the
[15:25] right fruits, right? The fruits of
[15:27] righteousness. Amen. The fruits of
[15:28] holiness. Amen. The fruits of brotherly
[15:31] kindness. The fruits of knowledge. The
[15:33] fruits of patience. Um so tying that in,
[15:37] we're going to come back to that in a
[15:38] minute, but getting back to the stages
[15:39] here. So once once kids hit a certain
[15:41] age, they start to eat the same food we
[15:43] eat. And and what they what you do is is
[15:46] they're going to watch you eat the food,
[15:48] right? My wife is is really she's just
[15:50] great about it. She'll, you know, she'll
[15:52] she'll show them and then she'll teach
[15:54] them and then when they do it, which is
[15:56] another important step is you you you
[15:58] encourage them, you know, they take a
[16:00] bite, it lands in their mouth, they get
[16:02] a big old smile and you say, "Yeah,
[16:03] that's awesome." You know, and because
[16:05] that's the stage that they're in, right?
[16:07] And so they watch, what do they do? They
[16:10] mimic. They watch you pick up food,
[16:12] right? So, we're going to tie in some
[16:13] spiritual things this morning. But, you
[16:15] know, as someone is a fresh Christian,
[16:18] right, they're watching you. They're
[16:20] watching the fruits that you bear,
[16:22] right? They're watching your life.
[16:24] They're watching everything that you do.
[16:26] And that's that's an important thing.
[16:28] They come to the church. Faith cometh by
[16:30] hearing and hearing the word of God. And
[16:32] then that word that they hear, they have
[16:35] to be able to see it put into
[16:36] application, which is the life of Christ
[16:38] bearing bearing in your life. Right? we
[16:41] bear the the the life of Christ. And so
[16:44] when when a when someone is is born
[16:46] again for a for a time again getting
[16:49] back to the concept and and application,
[16:52] you have the concept of what needs to be
[16:54] done and then you have the application
[16:56] of whatever it is actually being done.
[16:59] So there there is there's an
[17:00] understanding but then taking that
[17:03] taking that understanding because
[17:04] there's going to be a trial and error
[17:06] process. when I when I was going through
[17:07] that specific schooling, uh you I would
[17:11] be the first in line because I knew I
[17:13] was going to mess up a lot and I I
[17:14] didn't want to sit there and watch 20
[17:16] other people mess up because then in
[17:18] your mind you're like, "Oh, I'm going to
[17:19] mess up real bad." I wanted to mess up
[17:21] first, right? So then I'd get in line
[17:23] and I'd mess up real quick and then I'd
[17:25] do it. And then you just continually do
[17:27] it. You have to do so many hours where
[17:29] you're watching somebody else do it and
[17:31] then you do it yourself and then you're
[17:32] watching somebody else do it and then
[17:34] you're doing it yourself. you're watch
[17:35] it's concept and then it's application
[17:38] right so um it's it's the the the the
[17:42] children they have to learn how to eat
[17:45] right in order to survive it's a ba
[17:47] basic skill and so they learn that from
[17:49] their parents and as we all know it's
[17:51] it's a process right it takes patience
[17:55] but eventually it just becomes right a
[17:57] second nature to them and it's important
[18:01] to um it's important important to
[18:05] remember this to know that I don't want
[18:09] to say the word immature believers but
[18:11] believers that aren't completely matured
[18:13] in the word need to have models of
[18:15] mature believers. Amen. They need to
[18:18] have mature believers that they can look
[18:20] at and see, well, I saw the concept of
[18:22] this, but how is the application? We we
[18:26] know the application. The model, I'm
[18:27] going to start with this. The model is
[18:28] always Christ. Always look at Christ.
[18:31] But we are supposed to be bearing the
[18:34] fruits, not producing, but bearing the
[18:36] fruits. So, we should be able to model
[18:39] certain things, right, in our life. And
[18:41] and I just I just thought about that.
[18:44] Imagine we're going to take the negative
[18:46] and we're going to take the positive.
[18:48] I'll start with the negative. So we end
[18:49] with the positive. So it when someone
[18:52] can witness the word being lived, the
[18:55] word manifesting right in reality in
[18:58] people's lives, right? People living
[18:59] clean holy lives, fruit bearers of the
[19:02] word in the most impossible, in the most
[19:05] dark and at times in the most vulgar,
[19:08] you know, vulgar time that is God with
[19:11] skin on it, right? You are God with skin
[19:14] on it because you have the life of
[19:16] Christ living in you. And that will
[19:18] preach to people 10,000 times more than
[19:21] I could ever do that pastor could ever
[19:24] do because they're watching it live in
[19:26] your life. They're watching. Wow. I see
[19:28] the word and then I see it in their
[19:29] life. This this is this is that I I can
[19:32] see that this is the application of the
[19:34] concept that I I've been I've been
[19:36] reading about. I've been hearing about.
[19:37] Amen.
[19:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[19:39] And then they watch the impossible take
[19:42] place. And um you know talking to
[19:45] believers here, you know, and we we
[19:48] ought to model speaking just to I'm just
[19:50] speaking to myself this morning. We
[19:52] ought to model the right thing for
[19:54] others. Amen. We ought to always have
[19:56] people. You're always going to you're
[19:58] always going to be able to have an
[20:00] excuse to do the wrong thing or to live
[20:03] life a little close to the edge now. And
[20:06] you can take that in whatever direction
[20:08] you want to go, but there's always going
[20:10] to be an excuse for that. If if you want
[20:11] to live life close to the edge, you'll
[20:13] find a quote. You'll find a scripture.
[20:16] But as a genuine believer, you'll you
[20:19] should be doing the opposite. I want to
[20:21] make I want to find an excuse to live
[20:23] closer to the Lord. I want to find an
[20:25] excuse to live a holier life. I want to
[20:27] find an excuse to be more pleasing to
[20:29] the Lord, not to live my life on the
[20:31] edge. I don't we shouldn't have that
[20:33] kind of desire because it shows where
[20:35] your heart is, right? So, as genuine
[20:38] believers, our attitude and our approach
[20:40] should always be the opposite of that.
[20:41] We should always be trying to make an
[20:43] excuse to do the right thing. And I and
[20:44] I just thought of this uh simple analogy
[20:47] this morning, you know, in a road that
[20:49] we're that we're traveling on. Some
[20:51] people may lean a little bit too much
[20:54] right towards compromise in their life.
[20:56] They might lean, think about a road,
[20:58] you're leaning, maybe they're leaning a
[20:59] little too much towards compromise. And
[21:01] that's one side of the road. And maybe
[21:02] others lean a little bit too much
[21:04] towards legalism, right? Of course, the
[21:06] objective is always to be in the middle
[21:08] with balance. Just what the word says,
[21:10] just what the prophet says, just what he
[21:13] taught. But if you're ever going to lean
[21:14] one way for a time, never choose the way
[21:17] of compromise. Amen. If you lean that
[21:20] way, it shows where your heart is. And
[21:22] we should never start compromising
[21:24] anything in our life. Because if you
[21:26] start leaning the other way and you got
[21:27] the Lord in your life, he'll balance you
[21:29] out. Amen.
[21:31] &gt;&gt; Does that make sense? I'm not saying to
[21:32] be legal. I'm not saying to I'm saying
[21:34] balance. But if you're going to lean,
[21:36] don't lean this way. Amen. Lean this way
[21:39] and God will correct you. Amen.
[21:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[21:43] &gt;&gt; If you got Christ in your life, he'll
[21:45] balance you out. Amen.
[21:48] Um and of course, we we ought to we
[21:50] ought to be a light to the whole world.
[21:52] We should always live as as examples in
[21:54] our lives to other believers. You know,
[21:56] m maybe maybe young people look at your
[21:59] life. Maybe maybe your children. I read
[22:01] this I was reading this book and it said
[22:03] the primary place think of this
[22:05] statement. The primary place where I can
[22:08] make Christ I can how did he put that?
[22:12] The primary place where Christ is made
[22:14] flesh in my life is being a father to my
[22:17] children.
[22:19] &gt;&gt; The primary place that you can make the
[22:21] word live is to people that are closest
[22:23] to you because they see the life of
[22:25] Christ being lived out to to them by
[22:28] you. Right? Um,
[22:35] I know some of those things kind of seem
[22:37] strict. It's just
[23:06] or sister to stumble. Amen. Amen. Amen.
[23:10] Because 1 Corinthians 8:15 it says, "If
[23:14] wherefore if meat make my brother to
[23:16] offend, I will eat no flesh while the
[23:18] world standeth, lest I make my brother
[23:19] to offend." And in another verse or in
[23:21] another version of that, if food makes
[23:24] my brother stumble, I will never again
[23:26] eat meat less I make my brother stumble.
[23:28] You don't want to do things that are
[23:30] going to make someone stumble. Amen. And
[23:32] of course, there's always going to be,
[23:34] you know, you you have to you have to
[23:35] have the the right goggles on with that.
[23:37] You know, you there's always going to be
[23:39] somebody that probably is going to be
[23:41] offended at something. But if you know
[23:43] that something in your life could cause
[23:44] them to stumble, why would you want to
[23:46] do it? Stay away from that thing. They
[23:48] say, "Lord, if if if there if they're
[23:51] being uh if they're if there's something
[23:53] that I'm causing or doing or saying that
[23:56] is hindering a brother, Lord, help me to
[23:58] to find the right balance in it. Lord,
[24:00] help me to to do the right thing about
[24:02] it." Right? Amen. That's just the the um
[24:04] the attitude we should have. And the
[24:06] positive side of that is is what if
[24:08] because we took the negative or the
[24:10] negative over here, then no, the
[24:10] positive. The positive side of that is
[24:12] what if a young person is looking at
[24:13] you? Doesn't have to be a young person.
[24:15] Could be anybody. Maybe somebody that's
[24:17] not exactly spiritually grounded yet.
[24:19] Someone who's still young in their
[24:20] faith, but they're looking at you and
[24:22] they do see Christ in the flesh. They
[24:25] they do they do see uh a living, a
[24:28] breathing, a representative of the
[24:30] message. And it makes them want what you
[24:33] have. Amen. We're we're supposed to be
[24:36] the salt of the earth. Salt is is
[24:38] something that you want. It's it's
[24:39] savor, right? And we we we do what we do
[24:44] because it brings us joy. Amen. I I I do
[24:47] what I do because I I know it pleases
[24:49] the Lord and that's my objective in my
[24:51] life. And it and it's not something I
[24:53] have to do, but it's something that I
[24:55] want to do. And people can see the
[24:57] difference. I mean, you you can see the
[24:59] difference in someone's life if it's
[25:01] something that you have to do versus
[25:02] something that you actually want to do.
[25:04] You're doing it out of a genuine you
[25:06] you've got a spirit for this. Um,
[25:10] and the thing about bearing bearing
[25:11] fruit, simple something here, but uh
[25:13] when fruits come off the vine or off the
[25:15] tree and they're ripe, they're
[25:17] delicious. I remember my dad when when
[25:19] we were young, he he would get a mango
[25:21] and he would take that thing off and it
[25:23] would be ripe and man, he'd eat that
[25:25] thing. He, oh, this is delicious. Oh,
[25:27] man, it's so good because the the it
[25:29] it's ripe. It tastes good. If you've
[25:32] ever eaten some some kind of a fruit
[25:34] that like a an underripened banana,
[25:36] &gt;&gt; oh, that thing tastes terrible. Or you
[25:38] you try to you try to uh peel an orange,
[25:41] right, that's just hard. You can't even
[25:43] hardly peel it because it's so hard. And
[25:44] then you bite into that thing and it's
[25:46] sour. Nobody wants to eat that fruit.
[25:48] But if it's a fruit that's ripened, you
[25:50] want to eat that fruit. And now,
[25:51] spiritually thinking this morning, if
[25:53] it's a fruit, you're bearing fruits,
[25:55] right? You're bearing the fruits of
[25:57] these things. People are going to see
[25:58] that and they're going to want that.
[25:59] Wow. I want to I want to live it the way
[26:01] he's living it because he really Oh,
[26:03] man. That's awesome. Does that make
[26:04] sense this morning?
[26:06] &gt;&gt; They're they're delicious. Amen.
[26:09] Um
[26:12] and I made this point, but our model
[26:14] should always be Christ. I mean, don't
[26:15] model after somebody else, but I'm just
[26:18] saying everybody everybody looks, you
[26:20] know, whether you think it or not,
[26:21] people do look at our lives. They look
[26:23] at what you do. they look at how you
[26:24] act, you know, and when we should be
[26:27] bearing fruits and modeling holiness and
[26:30] modeling righteousness and and we're
[26:31] not, then maybe there's something
[26:34] there's something off somewhere,
[26:35] something wrong. Um, and as maturing
[26:37] believers in the word, our life should
[26:40] continually be growing into a mature
[26:42] place in the Lord. You know, and we we
[26:44] all have to look at ourselves in the
[26:46] mirror and and really reflect, are we
[26:49] are we still growing in our walk or or
[26:51] have we reached a place maybe that we're
[26:53] unwilling to fully yield a part of
[26:56] ourselves?
[26:58] um
[27:01] that scripture we opened with
[27:04] there there in first Corinthians, we are
[27:06] the temple of God, right? And the spirit
[27:08] of God dwelleth in you. And if you
[27:10] really think of the reality of that
[27:12] statement, brother Random had said that
[27:14] I already read this quote, but the house
[27:16] that God dwells in, not a building with
[27:18] a big bell on top and a steeple. See,
[27:20] but a body thou hast prepared me. He has
[27:24] chosen you as a vessel to live in.
[27:26] Right? But he cannot live. You can't he
[27:30] can't live in an unclean vessel. He
[27:32] can't live in an unwilling vessel. I'm
[27:34] not talking about mistakes. I have this
[27:35] in my notes. I'm not talking about
[27:36] mistakes. We're gonna make mistakes.
[27:38] Now, the the what I'm talking about is
[27:40] is the desire, you know, if you still
[27:42] have a desire for the things of the
[27:44] world or if you still have a desire to
[27:46] live life on the edge or if you still
[27:47] have a desire to do those things, then
[27:49] there's something wrong somewhere,
[27:51] right? There hasn't, you know, there's a
[27:52] maturing process, right? So things are
[27:54] things are are going to be cut off in
[27:56] your life and God is going to take you
[27:57] through stages. But you have to realize
[27:59] at every stage um
[28:03] at every stage like if my daughter who's
[28:06] almost four would still be at the same
[28:08] stage that my son is who is one then
[28:11] there would be a disconnect somewhere.
[28:12] Something would be something would be
[28:14] off. It could either be the training or
[28:16] it could just be there would be
[28:17] something a developmental something
[28:19] wrong but she should be progressing
[28:22] right and so when we find ourselves in
[28:24] junctures in our life if we find excuses
[28:28] to live life on the edge or if we find
[28:31] excuses to do a little bit of this maybe
[28:33] you know maybe you know we we want to go
[28:36] to a certain place
[28:39] little makeup we want to you know do a
[28:41] little bit of this whatever the case is
[28:43] our our desire desire should be the
[28:45] opposite of that. Lord, if there's
[28:47] anything in that, I want it and it's
[28:48] displeasing. I want to I want you to
[28:50] remove it from my life. I want you to
[28:52] change me because when you get to that
[28:54] stage, right, there's a stage, then you
[28:57] need to move past that stage. And if
[28:58] you're not growing right, if you're not
[29:01] growing, then there's something wrong.
[29:02] If there if you're not maturing, then
[29:04] there's something wrong. If you find
[29:06] yourself at a juncture and maybe the
[29:08] Lord has tried to get you to do
[29:11] something in your life, get rid of
[29:12] something in your life, change something
[29:13] in your life, and you're unwilling to do
[29:15] that, how would he be willing to live in
[29:17] that vessel? Amen. We have to get rid of
[29:19] those things. A and of course, you know,
[29:22] there's there's there's balance in that.
[29:24] Um, but uh sorry, I'm I'm I keep I'm
[29:28] going fast. I have wanted to I'm almost
[29:30] done here. Um,
[29:36] so there's there's the difference.
[29:37] There's there I wanted to contrast the
[29:39] kind of the difference there. A true son
[29:42] or a true daughter that has an
[29:44] experience with the Lord and and they
[29:46] obtain more than just a gift or more
[29:49] than just an experience, when they truly
[29:51] obtain the giver, their life will
[29:55] reflect that. And again, it may start to
[29:57] reflect that in stages, but you begin to
[29:59] see, okay, the Lord is really doing a
[30:02] work in their life. Amen. And and you
[30:06] know, and God doesn't always work
[30:07] overnight. I mean, maturing can
[30:09] definitely take some time, but but the
[30:11] difference is is if if something is is,
[30:14] you know, if months and then years go by
[30:16] and and there's still the same thing
[30:18] going on, then okay, where where's the
[30:21] where's the disconnect here? We we need
[30:23] to go back to God and we need to go back
[30:24] to Christ and and say, "Lord, I I need
[30:27] more of you to be able to cleanse and
[30:29] purge. Um and and you know, if if all
[30:32] that time takes place and then some
[30:34] spiritual growth isn't taking place,
[30:36] then then there's something missing. Um
[30:39] and I want to say this too, just in
[30:41] closing, uh you know, having the Lord
[30:43] operate your life and having having the
[30:45] the person of Jesus, I'm speaking to the
[30:47] choir here. All of you know this, but uh
[30:50] it's the best thing there is in the
[30:51] world." Amen. Isn't it? Isn't it's the
[30:53] best thing there is in the world.
[30:55] There's no experience like it. There's
[30:56] no amount of money. There's no
[30:57] satisfaction outside of that. And even
[31:00] further than that, again on the positive
[31:02] side of things, he wants all of
