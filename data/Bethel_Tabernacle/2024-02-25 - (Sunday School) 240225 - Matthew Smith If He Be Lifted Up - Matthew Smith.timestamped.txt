[0:03] good morning everybody um pardon me if
[0:07] I'm a little congested I'm uh trusting
[0:09] in the Lord to do our Sunday school
[0:11] today and in Halls so that's it's good
[0:15] um let's stand and have a word of
[0:18] prayer oh gracious
[0:20] father Lord we come before you this
[0:23] morning Lord not with anything that I
[0:27] would want to say or do but father that
[0:30] you would put have put something on my
[0:31] heart some words bring the people and
[0:34] Lord that it might be simple but
[0:37] Lord as I've once heard that father
[0:41] you're
[0:42] as as complicated as we might want you
[0:44] to be and as simple as we might need you
[0:46] to be so father maybe you would take
[0:48] these few simple words that I have and
[0:50] bring them to the people in such a way
[0:51] that they might find
[0:52] encouragement deliverance and they might
[0:55] press the battle ever stronger so father
[0:58] that if I could step out of the way and
[0:59] that it would not be my emotions or or
[1:03] my my feelings father but that it would
[1:05] be your word speaking through me so
[1:07] father I yield myself to you father as
[1:09] we turn to your word Lord we ask you
[1:12] would provide the context the text that
[1:14] we would read we ask these things in the
[1:16] name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen um I
[1:19] want to turn to
[1:22] um numbers
[1:26] 21 see here
[1:28] numbers
[1:35] 21 and
[1:36] verse
[1:42] four and uh you
[1:44] know lot of times you have a Sunday
[1:47] school or a sermon or something and you
[1:48] got 17 18 pages of notes with you know
[1:52] quotes and scriptures and couple
[1:54] thousand words of you know your own
[1:56] commentary or whatever in there and some
[1:57] days you have three scriptures on a
[1:59] piece of scrap paper
[2:00] so hopefully uh you don't mind Something
[2:03] Real Simple um so numbers 21 and
[2:07] verse4 says and they journeyed from
[2:10] Mount by the way of the Red Sea to
[2:13] Compass the land of Edom and the soul of
[2:15] the people was much discouraged because
[2:17] of the way and the people spake against
[2:20] God and against Moses wherefore have you
[2:22] brought us up out of Egypt to die in the
[2:25] wilderness for there is no bread neither
[2:27] is there any water and our soul loathes
[2:32] this light bread and the Lord sent fiery
[2:35] serpents among the people and they bit
[2:36] the people and much people of Israel
[2:39] died therefore the people came to Moses
[2:42] and said we have sinned for we have
[2:44] spoken against the Lord and
[2:47] against um spok the Lord and against
[2:51] thee pray unto the Lord that he take
[2:53] away the serpents from us and Moses
[2:56] prayed for the people and the Lord said
[2:58] unto Moses make thee a fiery Serpent and
[3:02] set it upon a pole and it shall come to
[3:04] pass that everyone that is bitten when
[3:06] he lookth upon it shall live and Moses
[3:09] made a serpent of brass and put it on a
[3:11] pole and it came to pass that if a
[3:12] serpent had bitten any man then he be
[3:15] when he beheld The Serpent of brass he
[3:18] lived man y'all can be
[3:21] seated
[3:26] um
[3:28] so
[3:32] this story as I'm sure
[3:35] um to you know when I I think about this
[3:40] you know if you're of any spiritual mind
[3:42] at all
[3:44] immediately the fact that the
[3:48] people would have that it would be
[3:50] serpents amongst them right should
[3:52] immediately be recognizing and and
[3:55] ultimately we know that that the brass
[3:57] serpent is a type of the crucifixion um
[4:00] which we'll get into maybe a little bit
[4:01] in a minute but this is a beautiful
[4:03] metaphor for for salvation and for the
[4:07] the state that Humanity finds themselves
[4:09] in because you know looking back to the
[4:12] to to Genesis and the original sin we
[4:14] know that Humanity has been bitten by a
[4:17] serpent right Humanity has been you know
[4:21] in the Garden of Eden Humanity was
[4:22] bitten by a serpent that there was a
[4:25] poison injected into the into the blood
[4:27] of humanity and that all of us are now
[4:29] now subject to that right that we carry
[4:32] this nature this serpent nature within
[4:34] us that we don't necessarily want we
[4:35] don't like it it poisons us it poisons
[4:38] the things that we do poisons the things
[4:39] that we
[4:40] think and we're all subject to die by
[4:43] that right that we all will die
[4:46] eventually because of that that bite of
[4:49] The
[4:51] Serpent and ultimately there is a sacrif
[4:54] you know there's an atonement right
[4:55] there was a sacrifice there was a a a
[4:59] something that would be lifted up that
[5:00] we could we could look to and be
[5:02] delivered from
[5:04] that um but I I want to just notice here
[5:09] that it it was that the people began to
[5:13] complain right it was the murmuring and
[5:16] the complaining that brought the serpent
[5:19] into their lives it was dissatisfaction
[5:22] with what they had that you know here
[5:26] they were in the
[5:27] desert and they begin to complain about
[5:30] God and against Moses and about what God
[5:32] was doing for them he just you know he
[5:33] delivered them from Egypt he delivered
[5:36] them from in in in in this particular
[5:38] scripture they had overcome any food
[5:40] right because it says that there it says
[5:42] well we don't have any bread any bread
[5:44] we don't don't have any water and we
[5:45] don't like this light bread well light
[5:46] bread they're referring to as
[5:48] Mana right they're saying well the the
[5:51] word that you've poured out upon us our
[5:53] daily bread that you've given us it
[5:55] doesn't make us feel good right it's not
[5:58] tasty enough right right it doesn't it
[6:00] doesn't give us immediate you know
[6:02] sensual fleshly
[6:04] gratification so we don't really want to
[6:06] eat that what we really want is some you
[6:09] know something more tasty something more
[6:12] you know that we our flesh likes more
[6:15] and they're finding all these excuses
[6:16] and they're laying this at the feet of
[6:17] God and and the prophet like it's their
[6:21] fault
[6:22] completely completely focused on the
[6:24] here and now and the
[6:25] temporal right not completely ignoring
[6:28] what God had already done for them
[6:29] delivered them out of Egypt completely
[6:31] ignoring what God was doing for them
[6:32] when he would take them into a promised
[6:34] land and just looking at their
[6:36] particular issues right here right now
[6:38] and saying well I don't feel very good
[6:41] right now therefore it's God's
[6:43] fault right therefore it's Moses
[6:46] fault and so God sends serpents amongst
[6:49] them um you know I I once heard somebody
[6:54] say it just so I thought it was pretty
[6:56] profound said that complaining is for
[7:00] the devil what worship is for God Amen
[7:03] like huh that's a thought you know
[7:07] people how many time you know the Bible
[7:08] talks about giving praise to the Lord
[7:10] always and and everything that you do
[7:11] give praise un the Lord and that's true
[7:14] and you should do it but how often are
[7:16] people praising the devil every time
[7:19] they open their mouth to complain you
[7:21] know every time we look at our situation
[7:23] and go well this is not to my liking and
[7:26] you have some word of
[7:28] complaint in in in complaining you are
[7:31] ultimately lifting up Satan and what
[7:34] he's
[7:35] doing and you're and you're not
[7:37] recognizing that God is sufficient for
[7:39] all your
[7:43] needs
[7:45] so you know and and so many times people
[7:51] have people have so much to to complain
[7:54] about whether it's you know maybe it's
[7:55] maybe it's the people complain about
[7:57] preachers you know they don't necess
[7:58] like one person or the other you know
[8:00] they have different preferences and you
[8:01] know people are different people have
[8:03] preferences that's
[8:05] okay you know
[8:07] but how often do
[8:11] um you know when you nothing nothing
[8:14] breeds Discord in in a in a group or in
[8:17] a body like people complaining amen
[8:20] right I don't know if if you know
[8:22] anybody you've ever been like on a
[8:23] sports team or or even like a
[8:25] construction site or something like that
[8:27] and you got a lot of guys and or girls
[8:29] or whoever and everyone's trying to you
[8:31] know work towards some common goal and
[8:33] the conditions are miserable and
[8:35] nothing's going according to plan and
[8:36] the weather's bad and you know whatever
[8:40] whatever obstruction and complication
[8:43] has
[8:44] arisen and everybody knows it's
[8:46] miserable and it takes one person to
[8:48] start complaining and then everyone
[8:49] wants to quit right complaining will rip
[8:52] through a a an organization so fast and
[8:57] just pollute the attitude of everyone
[8:58] involved so
[9:00] fast is like a plague you know and you
[9:05] know you you know my context like I say
[9:07] construction sites or whatever you know
[9:08] you'll you'll be everyone will be you
[9:10] know trying to push through get the job
[9:12] done it's miserable and everybody knows
[9:13] it you know material didn't show up on
[9:15] time and then it starts raining and now
[9:18] everyone's having to dig the ditch in
[9:19] the rain and it just got so much worse
[9:22] than it could have been and it was hot
[9:23] earlier in the day so now you have a
[9:25] sauna and everyone's got something to
[9:26] complain about and everyone's just
[9:27] talking about how miserable it is and we
[9:28] all just want to throw down to go
[9:31] home and you get one person to start to
[9:33] complain and it becomes infectious and
[9:35] then everyone wants to complain and
[9:37] before long it's the boss's fault and he
[9:39] should have checked the weather better
[9:40] and I can't believe he sent us out here
[9:42] to dig this in the rain and we're
[9:43] tearing up the customers lawn anyways
[9:46] and it's like well before long it's
[9:49] whose fault that the that it rained it's
[9:51] not the boss's fault that it rained you
[9:54] know but no it's his fault you
[9:57] know it people will and so when people
[10:01] get mad and discontent suddenly they got
[10:02] to find somebody to throw under the bus
[10:05] right and so often Our Lives will be
[10:08] will be you know we're going through
[10:11] some hard things and really what it is
[10:12] is God teaching us to be content and to
[10:15] trust him even when it things get
[10:17] difficult right and the minute that
[10:20] people go to start complaining the same
[10:22] thing happens in a church by the way you
[10:26] know things get difficult maybe there's
[10:29] you you know something's going on maybe
[10:30] whatever it is people start complaining
[10:32] and oh you know you have one one person
[10:34] in the church starts having a problem
[10:36] and suddenly the gossip starts coming
[10:38] around you know and people start getting
[10:41] getting uh you
[10:43] know everybody breaks up into their
[10:46] little clicks and that click is talking
[10:47] about that click and this little group
[10:49] is is you know did you hear about what
[10:50] so and so did you know and and it it's
[10:53] Discord it's it's discontent it's
[10:55] disunity in the church how often do we
[10:59] read in the book of Acts in Acts chapter
[11:02] 2 when they when the Holy Ghost fell on
[11:04] them and they were imbued with power it
[11:05] was because they were in one mind and
[11:06] one Accord you want to break the Oneness
[11:09] and the unity of a church start
[11:13] complaining right start complaining and
[11:16] before long the serpent nature that's
[11:18] inside of everyone's going to start
[11:19] coming out right the you're going to
[11:22] have a church infested with snakes
[11:24] infested with serpents everyone's going
[11:26] to get bit and
[11:30] and it's not just you know and it's
[11:31] discontent with anything it's it's you
[11:34] know just because they were they they
[11:36] had no faith in what God was doing no
[11:39] faith in what in in the ability for God
[11:42] to deliver them from whatever situation
[11:45] and whatever their their trials
[11:47] were
[11:50] and you know so often times you know you
[11:54] look at your
[11:55] life and you ask yourself why do I not
[11:59] have the ability to overcome why do I
[12:01] not have victory in my life why am I
[12:03] having all these
[12:05] troubles have you stopped to really
[12:07] think about when the last time you gave
[12:09] thanks to the Lord
[12:11] was right even when it's miserable
[12:14] you're still supposed to raise your
[12:16] hands and praise the Lord even when even
[12:19] when it's you know everything is
[12:21] disaster that's not the time to start
[12:23] complaining if you start complaining of
[12:25] course you're not going to have any
[12:27] Victory you know it's like you know we
[12:29] talk about that the that the uh you know
[12:32] we've been made more than you know more
[12:33] than conquerors and Overcomers what
[12:35] exactly are we conquering and
[12:37] overcoming you know it's we don't have
[12:39] am malachit across town that we got to
[12:41] go
[12:42] destroy right though half the time
[12:44] people act that way no it's it's the man
[12:48] in the mirror right that's who you're
[12:49] conquering that's who you need to have
[12:50] victory over and if you want to ensure
[12:52] that you f that that guy beats you start
[12:56] complaining right start complaining and
[12:58] that serpent that looks back at you from
[13:00] the mirror will annihilate
[13:10] you and so
[13:14] ultimately you know I I noticed you know
[13:16] another thing to to to notice is that
[13:19] when Moses makes the serpent they come
[13:21] to him and said well we've we've sinned
[13:23] you know we we spoke out against you
[13:25] when we spoke out against God pray for
[13:27] us that the Lord would deliver us of
[13:29] this of these this this serpent you know
[13:33] this serpent nature that has attacked
[13:36] us and the the atonement the brass
[13:39] serpent that he raises up it doesn't
[13:41] make the snakes go away it means that it
[13:43] doesn't have any power anymore right
[13:47] you're never because of that serpent
[13:51] nature in your
[13:52] flesh that Fallen nature that Fallen man
[13:55] in your flesh isn't going to disappear
[13:56] until the Rapture you're to live with
[14:01] him the what you know the the the the
[14:05] the brass serpent that we look to
[14:07] doesn't make that go away it means that
[14:10] you have the ability to overcome it
[14:11] means it has no power over
[14:15] you I want to turn to um John chapter
[14:23] 3 and um we'll go to verse
[14:28] 13 and it
[14:31] says um and no man hath ascended up to
[14:34] heaven but he that come down from heaven
[14:37] even the son of man which is in heaven
[14:40] and as Moses lifted up the serpent in
[14:42] the wilderness even so must the son of
[14:44] man be lifted up that whosoever
[14:47] believeth in him should not perish but
[14:49] have eternal life for God so loved the
[14:52] world that he gave his only begotten son
[14:55] that whosoever believeth in him should
[14:56] not perish but have everlasting life
[14:59] for God sent sent not his son into the
[15:02] world to condemn the world but that the
[15:05] world through him might be
[15:07] saved he that believeth on him is not
[15:09] condemned but he that believeth not is
[15:12] condemned already because he hath not
[15:14] believed in the name of the only
[15:16] begotten Son of
[15:19] God and this is the condemnation that
[15:22] light is come into the world and man
[15:24] loved Darkness rather than light because
[15:26] their deeds were evil for everyone that
[15:28] doeth evil Vil hateth the light neither
[15:31] cometh to the light lest his deeds
[15:33] should be reproved but he that doeth
[15:36] truth cometh to the light that the Deeds
[15:39] may be made manifest that they are
[15:41] wrought in
[15:45] God and so ultimately you know we look
[15:48] at at this story you know of some people
[15:51] complaining and being dis content and
[15:53] ultimately what their sin was is failure
[15:56] to believe in the delivering power of
[15:58] God
[15:59] am it's failure to recognize that the
[16:01] word of God had had brought them that
[16:04] far had brought them out of Egypt that
[16:05] it was by the spoken word of God that
[16:07] they were where they were at that point
[16:09] and that it was the same word that was
[16:10] going to carry into the promised land
[16:12] and because they failed to hold that
[16:15] they they knew that God had brought them
[16:17] that far and they just chose
[16:20] not to cling to that to not put their
[16:22] faith in that they just chose to look to
[16:25] their
[16:26] circumstances and that's where they
[16:30] that's where the the failure came and so
[16:32] often times I mean we fail all the time
[16:35] you know even if it's not necessarily
[16:36] you know complaining it's always
[16:38] something all sin is unbelief right all
[16:41] sin is failure to recognize who you are
[16:45] and it recognize to to believe that you
[16:48] should not do those things you
[16:53] know there's
[16:57] a there's a difference between somebody
[17:00] who who knows something and somebody who
[17:04] believes something you know there's a
[17:06] difference there's a difference
[17:09] there you know I
[17:11] um I so at one time I went rock climbing
[17:14] at like one of those rock climbing
[17:15] places and I don't like heights I never
[17:18] have but I want to do it anyway so I
[17:21] climb up this wall and it's really high
[17:22] up there and um you have your your
[17:25] harness and your rope and everything and
[17:27] the whole time you're climbing up there
[17:28] I know in my head I believe this thing's
[17:30] going to hold me this I'm not falling
[17:32] off this off side of this wall right I
[17:35] I'm not going to break this
[17:36] rope but until you jump off the side of
[17:39] that wall and throw your entire weight
[17:42] like because you have to come back down
[17:43] you have to repel back down till you
[17:45] jump off the side of that wall and
[17:46] really put some faith in it you don't
[17:48] really you don't really believe in it
[17:50] you know it's that moment where you're
[17:51] at the top and you're your arms are kind
[17:53] of like man I got to jump off the side
[17:54] of this thing because I can't hang on
[17:56] anymore but I really really don't trust
[17:59] this thing you know
[18:03] I but until you go and kick off that
[18:06] wall you don't really believe it's going
[18:08] to hold you now once you do and you know
[18:11] you feel the thing catch and you and you
[18:13] go to the ground now you believe in it
[18:16] now there's no trouble you can go up and
[18:17] down that wall as many times as you want
[18:18] and you have and then it kind of becomes
[18:19] kind of fun right because you
[18:21] know
[18:23] but so often times we know you know we
[18:25] read the Bible and all the Lord is a
[18:27] pres ever presentent help in the time of
[18:28] trouble and yes it's very good but until
[18:31] you actually face it do you really
[18:33] believe it right until it's time to
[18:36] really throw yourself into the hands of
[18:39] God and say Lord You're All I've got
[18:42] that's right do you really believe
[18:44] it and so my
[18:48] my I guess my encouragement to
[18:51] you is that you know it's not enough to
[18:54] just say well I see this in the in the
[18:56] scripture I know the Lord you know we
[18:58] look look at ourselves because
[19:00] ultimately the the the brass Serpent and
[19:02] the serpents in the desert and all these
[19:04] things it's just a it's just a parable
[19:05] it's a metaphor it's a it's a type of
[19:07] what we struggle with today in this dark
[19:09] day this evil day of looking at
[19:12] ourselves in the mirror and recognizing
[19:14] all the places where we fail all the
[19:16] places where we fall short all the
[19:18] serpents in our lives that are just
[19:21] hanging off of us and half the time it's
[19:24] our own fault because of the places
[19:25] where we doubted the places where we
[19:27] fell short and now we have a serpent
[19:29] that's that we got to deal with you know
[19:33] and we're having to come back to God and
[19:34] say Lord I I need help it was my fault
[19:38] that this happened but will you help me
[19:40] anyhow
[19:42] and you know God didn't God didn't say
[19:45] no you brought this on
[19:47] yourself have fun with the snakes you
[19:50] know he gave them he gave them away out
[19:52] he gave him an atonement you know this
[19:55] is that's where that's where we have to
[19:57] you know when we come to God we say
[19:58] listen Lord I am Bound by things that I
[20:01] brought on
[20:02] myself the you there's a brass serpent
[20:05] to look to you know you don't have the
[20:07] you know you
[20:08] don't and you're like we look at these
[20:11] things and say Lord I can't overcome the
[20:13] man in the mirror and that's correct you
[20:15] can't there's you're not going to you
[20:17] literally can't do it it's outside of
[20:19] your power but but you were never
[20:22] intended to right the Lord is there to
[20:26] help you the Lord is is the one one you
[20:29] know one thing that I that so struck me
[20:32] about the scripture so here's Jesus is
[20:34] showing there's a tip between the brass
[20:35] Serpent and himself right obviously we
[20:36] know that Christ goes to the cross and
[20:38] and here he is lifted up on a on a pole
[20:40] you know like just like the brass
[20:41] serpent you could look to the Cross you
[20:42] could look to the serpent you know it's
[20:44] you all see the type here but the
[20:46] question that I had was wait a minute
[20:49] why does the type show a serpent on the
[20:53] pole Jesus wasn't a
[20:55] serpent right why isn't it a lamb up
[21:00] there
[21:02] well you know when the because the you
[21:05] know we we'll talk about the lamb you
[21:06] know that the man when he brought the
[21:08] lamb as a sacrifice he put his hand on
[21:09] the Lamb's head and he's what he's doing
[21:11] is he's putting all of his sin onto this
[21:13] innocent one the lamb didn't commit any
[21:15] sins but the man did and the man is
[21:17] putting his sin on the lamb the lamb
[21:19] becomes his sin and then when the lamb
[21:21] dies so does his
[21:22] sin okay and so when Christ goes to the
[21:26] Cross Christ was sinless he was a
[21:28] perfect lamb but your sin was on him he
[21:31] took all of your sin all the things that
[21:33] all of your sinful nature all the places
[21:36] where you fell and you failed and you
[21:39] knew better and did it
[21:41] anyways and he puts all that onto
[21:44] himself and he goes on that cross and
[21:46] when he dies so does your
[21:49] sin and it's not and the reason why
[21:53] there's no lamb Moses didn't raise up a
[21:55] lamb for the people to see is because
[21:57] the lamb
[21:59] being Christ right it's the type of
[22:01] Christ who I mean Christ has has no you
[22:04] know he's no father no mother no
[22:05] beginning of days or ending of life you
[22:07] can't really kill him not really you
[22:10] know you could take him out of the world
[22:11] from it but he came back he resurrected
[22:14] because he has no beginning therefore he
[22:15] can have no end if there was a you know
[22:18] if there was a lamb on the pole you know
[22:20] raised up for the people to look at if
[22:23] Moses had made it a
[22:25] lamb it's not a finished work cuz the
[22:28] work was was finished when he
[22:30] resurrected
[22:31] right but there was a serpent because
[22:35] when the lamb and the serpent both go to
[22:36] the Cross when it's all said and done
[22:39] the Serpent's the only thing still up
[22:41] there right the lamb got off the cross
[22:44] the serpent
[22:45] didn't right the serpent had a beginning
[22:48] and it has an end right you might have
[22:53] faults and failures now but ultimately
[22:55] that serpent nature that you struggle
[22:57] against die died it's gone you don't
[23:01] have to be subject to that thing
[23:02] anymore the the the the the lamb has has
[23:08] has
[23:11] um that's there's no power anymore
[23:15] because death has died right you're no
[23:18] longer subject to that you know the in
[23:20] in Genesis when when Humanity Falls
[23:24] there's a curse put on Humanity that you
[23:28] know there there's um there's sickness
[23:30] there's death there's excuse me things
[23:32] that we're going to
[23:35] encounter but once the penalty for sin
[23:37] has been paid you're no longer required
[23:39] to Bear the burden of that and so
[23:41] anything that we would come in in in
[23:44] need of I mean obviously I don't know
[23:45] what any of y'all's situations are
[23:49] um but just recognize that no matter
[23:52] what your situation is even the greatest
[23:53] ones the things that might not
[23:55] necessarily
[23:57] be um um you know so often times we at
[24:01] least for me maybe y'all are different
[24:03] but I know for me a lot of the times
[24:05] it's it's harder for me to look at the
[24:07] problems that I have spiritually and the
[24:09] struggles that I have and say and to
[24:12] have faith for that than it is to even
[24:14] have faith for something like healing or
[24:15] or something like that because I it's
[24:17] easy for me to look at a sickness and
[24:19] say well by a Stripes I am healed you
[24:21] know there's an atonement for that you
[24:23] know that was that's just the curse of
[24:24] the devil and we're going to overcome
[24:25] that but when you're looking at
[24:27] something said I did this to my myself
[24:28] and I deserve
[24:29] it where that's where you got to have
[24:32] faith right that's that's hard you know
[24:36] and so I don't know what anybody what
[24:38] anybody is is dealing with and I'm just
[24:41] I got I'm out of time so I'm just going
[24:42] to wrap up with this you know I just
[24:44] want to encourage all of you all to
[24:45] recognize that you know even no matter
[24:47] what the situation is amen there's an
[24:51] atonement there's a brass serpent to
[24:52] look to Christ no matter what your
[24:54] situation is no matter where you're
[24:55] struggling no matter how the devil has
[24:57] come against you there is a a there is
[25:01] an atonement and a brass Serpent and you
[25:02] can look at look at that and you can
[25:04] look at that and say I know where my
[25:07] current situation is right and the and
[25:10] the devil may have me in a bind right
[25:12] now but I can look to that atonement and
[25:13] recognize that is the devil's end so
[25:16] let's let's stand and have a a word of
[25:19] prayer real
