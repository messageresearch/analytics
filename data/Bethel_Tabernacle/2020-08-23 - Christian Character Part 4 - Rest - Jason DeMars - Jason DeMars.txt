========================================

now he's the general manager of the what used to be known as the washington redskins and uh years ago he made this statement that if you have anxiety just bring your anxiety to christ and he'll take care of that now he's in a position of power and he's distancing himself he says no absolutely people need professional help and take care hey what are you ashamed of the gospel of christ you don't think anxiety christ can take care and solve your problem anxiety it has to be dealt with in psychological don't think that way think another way that's not what christ does christ looks to your heart and says i see you're troubled i see you're weary come to me lay your burdens at my feet and i'll bring healing that's true transformation that's that comes from the spirit of god in the heart doesn't mean we don't have troubles when we put our trust in christ it means troubles increase and our need to trust him continually increases you know it's a it is a quiet submission to the will of god quietness and confidence quietly waiting on him for the issue of events you know the picture is stay in your house stay in your own house don't hurry around in a two-month running this way running that way protecting just stop just rest god is in control god is on the throne god is the king he he sees it all he knows it all you can just be at rest that he will take care of you he's promised it jeremiah 6 verse 16. thus saith the lord stand you in the ways and see and ask for the old paths where is the good way and walk therein and you shall find rest for your souls but they said we will not walk therein he says look look look to the old ways don't try to find the modern way the modern prescriptions the new ways look back to god's word come back to the original truth of god's word walk in the original reality of christ the word manifested and displayed before you come back to that that's where you'll find rest for your soul you're not going to find rest in your outward situation there's all in this world you'll have troubles jesus said that but be of good cheer i've overcome the world you know it's not that place where we figure out okay i reach this achievement on the outside to have rest i mean think about the man that built up his barns and built up his farm and he filled his barns up and he says now i say oh soul be at rest and god immediately says you fool you fool why what is he looking for he was looking for rest merely on a fleshly temporary level that's foolish god is not looking for that in our lives well as soon as my savings account is at this place and my retirement as a count is this way i'm i'm going to be at rest i'm sorry that's not god's program i'm not saying saving money isn't it clearly is i'm not saying investing for the future isn't it clearly is god's program but it's not where we put our confidence it's not where we find our quietness it's in returning that we find rest return to your home where is your home it's in christ it's not in minnesota or delaware or new mexico or philadelphia pennsylvania your your arrest your home is in christ that's the place that you'll find peace uh obvious scripture when we're talking about rest is matthew 11. brother joe if you want to pull that up matthew 11 verse 25 through 30. at that time jesus answered and said i thank thee o father lord of heaven and earth because thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent and has revealed them unto babes so often we take take these verses and we we separate them out and we isolate them but i want to take this as a whole god is revealing himself to babes to those who are humble 26 even so father for so it seemed good in thy sight it's god's good pleasure to reveal himself to those who are humble to those who don't have a high viewpoint of themselves and their greatness and power and glory and position all things verse 27 all things are delivered unto me of my father and no man knows the son but the father neither knoweth any man the father saved the son and he to whomsoever the son will reveal him the father being the invisible spirit god and the son being the man christ jesus the visible manifestation of the invisible god no one knows the father except the son and the only ones that have a relationship or with god are the ones that the son reveals that invisible god to them notice what he says next this is in another topic verse 28 come unto me all ye that labor and are heavy laden and i will give you rest where are we gonna how are we gonna come to him he's going to reveal he's going to come to us and reveal him self to us in that revelation now come to me where do we find rest in that revelation of jesus christ come all you that labor and are heavy laden you're you're you're working you're trying to achieve god's pleasure by work by works of your own by what you do on the outward and christ is saying that's not where you find salvation that's not where you find peace come to me come come i will reveal the father to you i will show the secret things of god to you and in that revelation you'll find rest and then verse 29 he says take my yoke upon you a close fellowship a close friendship a close relationship right there it's the picture is of two oxen tied together on a yoke and he says come here i'm going to show you this is how you work you're going to work in out of your fellowship and connection to me you're not going to work on your own your work it's toilsome it's weary and it's it's in vain but come and yoke together and work with me and ultimately we understand it's christ working it's not us working take my yoke upon you and learn of me for i am meek and lowly in heart and you shall find rest unto your souls this world and its religions are taskmasters and i don't care if it's you're talk i'm not talking about outside of the message i'm saying the world's religions and there's many preachers and people that are putting a yoke on people that's heavy and burdensome they're not showing them the reality of christ they're showing them the reality of a works-based system if you look like this and dress like this and act like this you're right with god people can do that and their heart can be so far from him no it's come and be yoked together with christ and you'll then you'll find rest because it's in that revelation of himself that you find rest and we come and he discloses himself to us he's not a gr he's not a great mystery far off he's right there we're walking with him we're his we're his we're his bride walking together with him and in we learn from him he shows himself that he's meek and lowly in heart and he'll find rest to your souls you know paul says i'm the prisoner of jesus christ and we hear that word and we think oh that's that's difficult that's hard that's harsh but the reality is who would you rather be a prisoner of than the one that came and said i lay down my life for my friends i give myself away completely that's not a hard thing to do to be a prisoner of a man that would do that for for for his friends he he says you'll find rest for your souls that's what i want we live in a world that is combating rest social media is combating rest you go on there and you say oh this person's on a trip oh this person's doing this fun thing oh this person's uh doing this and you say oh my life is terrible though those that that's designed by the devil to take and steal your rest what are you looking at what are you feeding on what are you feasting on if you're feasting on that you're not going to have rest but if you're feasting on and are yoked with christ you'll find rest for your soul for verse 30 for my yoke is easy and my burden is light now that can be misunderstood because we understand that all that live godly in christ jesus shall suffer persecution that was our first two topics in this series we all we all have trials and difficulties that god has laid out for us to walk in but we find that if we try to carry it on our own it's not easy but when we find when we find when we try to carry it in tandem yoked with jesus christ it becomes a whole lot easier it comes a whole lot more more tolerable we find rest in the sermon shalom brother banham says when we see darkness settling darkness just before day we know that the morning stars hanging yonder to introduce the coming sun that's when the morning star shines it's in the going between it's always darkest just before a few minutes before day the blackout comes the moon fails to shine the darkest before day is the light because the light is pressing the darkness but the morning star comes out and says good morning shalom that's him among us did you hear that what is your good morning what is your shalom it's him among us he's come he's come down in this day to reveal himself what is it shalom it's peace it's rest his word being identified shalom the great day is fixing to break when the morning breaks eternal bright and fair when his chosen one shall gather to their home beyond the sky when the role is con yonder i'll be there our names are on his book we'll be there shalom good morning peace be unto you the darkness is separating itself from the light isn't that the truth what an hour we're living in god's causing it the light's doing it see the lights pressing itself in such a way until the darkness has to congregate together in an hour of darkness in an hour where there's no rest for the human mind god is saying i'm i'm here i've come down shalom peace good morning i'm i'm here for you that you would have peace what's preventing your peace what's preventing your rest you have to enter into it hebrews 3. we'll start at verse 7 we're going to go through as many scriptures as we possibly can here trying to speed up a little bit wherefore as the holy ghost saith today if you will hear his voice i want you to notice that that's what we that's where we start hear his voice today if you hear his voice that's the starting place have you heard his voice has he called you have you heard him speak verse 8 harden not your hearts as in the provocation in the day of temptation in the wilderness when your fathers tempted me proved me and saw my works forty years wherefore i was grieved with that generation and said they do always err in their heart and they have not known my ways verse 11 so i swear in my wrath they shall not enter into my rest rest speaks of abode dwelling place reposing down they're not going to enter into my presence which brings them rest why were they not going to enter into that their hearts were hard they didn't hear they heard the voice of god but they responded with unbelief verse 12 take heed brethren lest there be any of you an evil heart of unbelief in departing from the living god but exhort one another daily we need each other we need one another daily it doesn't say exhort one another twice a week on wednesday and sunday night you know it says daily we need we need that why because the world is lying to us every day while it is called today exhort one another daily while it is called today lest any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin we're bombarded with the deceitfulness of sin every direction every day we're being lied to every day by the media by the things that we see in public by people around us um at our work and and the places that we go we're being lied to so we need each other what for what to speak the truth into one another's life that's not just for the pastor or the preacher to do that's for every believer exhort one another it doesn't say preach or exhort the people well it doesn't say that to timothy but this is not talking about that this is talking about you you need to exhort other people and other people need to exhort you exhort means encourage conv convict speak the word over people when once a week no daily well it is called today lest any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin in other words you need exhortation daily or you're going to be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin so get exhort somebody and pray that somebody would exhort you that's we need each other verse 14 for we are made partakers of christ if we hold the beginning of our confidence steadfast to the end while it is today said today if you will hear his voice harden on your hearts as in the provocation for some when they had heard did provoke how be it not all came out not all that came out by moses but with whom was he grieved 40 years was it not with them that sinned whose carcasses fell in the wilderness and to whom swear that he that they should not enter into his rest but to them that believe not so we see that they could not enter in because of unbelief so rest was offered right true rest in almighty god not just the sabbath day but genuine spiritual rest for the soul was offered to them they couldn't enter in why because based on their circumstances based on what they saw around them in the wilderness they said i don't believe god i don't believe his promises i don't believe what's happening i can't accept god's word because my circumstances are not reflective of what he's telling me so how do we enter into rest the opposite of unbelief faith trust uh four let's see yeah four verse one let us therefore fear lest a promise being left of us of entering into his rest any of you should seem to come short of it so we should have a godly reverence because we know that through unbelief based upon our circumstances we can put our soul in a state of tumult now that doesn't mean we lose our salvation in in in the christian sense of understanding that if you're born again but there's a condition of the soul that produces rest and there's a condition of the soul that produces tumult verse 2 for unto us was the gospel preached as well as unto them but the word preached did not profit them the promise was there the promise was in effect but it was no it was unprofitable to them not being mixed with faith in them that heard it for we which have believed do enter into rest as he said if you believe faith produces rest genuine faith given by god leads to rest if you don't have rest what are you abiding in as he said as i have sworn in my wrath if they shall enter into my rest although the works were finished from the foundation of the world for he spake in a certain place of the seventh day on this wise and god did rest the seventh day from his works and in this place again if they shall enter into my rest seeing therefore it remaineth that some must enter therein and they to whom it is first preached entered not in because of unbelief again he limited a certain day saying in david today after so long time as it is said today if you hear his voice harden not your hearts faith comes by hearing hearing by the word of god if you hear his voice personally to you don't harden your heart verse 9 i'm going to skip a little bit there remaineth there for a rest to the people of god verse 10 for he that had entered into his rest he's also ceased from his own works as god did from his you have to cease from your own works to enter into rest this is the verse that i wanted to get to and quickly quickly finish let us labor therefore to enter into rest lest any man fall after the same example of unbelief labor to enter into rest work to enter into rest what does that mean how do you labor or work to enter into that rest it's not by your own works he just said cease from your own works it's not by trying to please god through what you personally can do how do you lent how do you labor to enter into that right rest second peter 3 18 says but grow in grace and in the knowledge of our lord and savior jesus christ john 8 31 says if you continue in my word then are you my disciple disciples indeed we grow into rest by degree as we continue to believe and as we pray more and more and hear the word and attend services and fellowship with one another around the word if we take the means of grace that god has given to us we abide in those it takes effort for you and i to stay in that condition that we have rest in our souls if we just let ourselves fall into the natural things of life we lose rest we lose peace we don't have it we fall into the place of unbelief the bible says we're transformed by the renewing of our mind the the bible says that we're renewed into his image as we behold the spirit of the lord so we have to stay in that position of beholding we have to stay in that position of walking in prayer and in feeding on the word that is our labor to enter into rest he says take my yoke upon you that's that's the labor that this is speaking of it's not speaking of you plea you you please god through your works simply saying i'm staying close to christ i'm abiding in the word so that rest remains in my soul i have to finish there father we just come to you lord and we ask that you would just really strike our hearts with the revelation of of rest that you have for us lord as the bible says let us therefore fear unless the promise being given we not enter into it lord it's not a mortal fear like that but it's a great reverence that we have for you and for for for your purpose in our lives so lord we ask that your spirit would work in us in such a way that we would not be hindered from pursuing you and pursuing the rest that you've promised to those who abide in faith we commit ourselves to you lord we commit the service the worship the preaching of the word to you we ask that your name would be lifted up and glorified and that every heart would connect to you we commit these things to you in the name of jesus christ amen
