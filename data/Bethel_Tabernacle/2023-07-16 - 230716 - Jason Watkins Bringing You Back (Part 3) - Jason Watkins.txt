to go back and teach my old Sunday school class brother Travis let me have it today and next Sunday and we had a wonderful time didn't we guys amen praise the Lord gals and guys amen they ended up in a tie in a competition so in part two we got to decide a winner but they found out what it is to be a friend of God lots and lots of advantages I thought I had a lot of advantages that I went through the Bible with them showing them what it be mean to be a friend of God I mean goodness Abraham Abraham you know got Insider information Abraham got to shape Royal policy you find 50. okay 40 30 12 20 10. he had literally got into shape Royal policy I mean that's a pretty big advantage to being a friend of God David got top secret military Intel told Lord told him where the enemy would be told him where to hide in the field stay in the trees wait for wait till you hear the sound of my angel Army marching out ahead of you and then just fall in behind admire there's so many advantages the disciples got to understand The Parables Lord now tell us the secret what does this all mean and uh and so we went through all of those things they have angels that are assigned to them from birth and brother Brandon said they don't go home they stay with you in life and you know and and oh my we had so many that we looked at in the Bible and you know so many advantages you know you're a secret agent you have a hotline directly to heaven anytime anywhere you won't your signal won't drop your battery won't go dead oh we had a good time and then I thought I had pretty well covered them all and then I put them on two different teams boys and girls and I'm always favoring the girls and boys go you're giving them more time and well they're special they get more time amen they're the weaker vessels so I got to help them out amen and so uh and they ended up yeah I thought I'd come up with a bunch my goodness I hadn't hardly scratched the surface they started you get a body change okay okay good one amen amen praise the Lord you got to go in the Rapture you don't have to be in a spirit of fear this is all advantages to being the friend of God I want to be his friend amen I left there wanting to be his friend even more so next Sunday I told him we got a lab we're gonna do and uh to to augment what we learned today hey man turn around and shake hands with somebody standing near you say God bless you it's good to have you here in the house of the Lord happy to have visitors with us this morning God bless you amen you helped make up for some of the families who are away traveling amen praise God happy to have you all here in God's house I want you just to feel welcome and relaxed we're just amen simple people that love the Lord and believe the word amen we're going to invite you to Psalms chapter 30. for this morning amen I'm certainly looking forward to our meetings coming up with brother Daryl Ward and I just want to say that while the fact remains that you know we've got a a lot of young people coming in that have registered this is what we do every year um I I think this time this year we'll have more places uh for some of the local adults to come on to church there should be room for you I think we only have about maybe 50 or so young people registered last last count I got I think that includes ours so we should have plenty of room we're gonna have a banquet we'll have a service Friday night and then activities for them Saturday daytime and then a a service Friday night regular service and then Saturday Time Event and then Saturday evening uh banquet at the urban improved there won't be a service here and then Sunday morning a service but but listen don't you adults say oh it's a youth weekend we're going to stay home don't you dare do that amen come and support amen if you don't I promise you uh brother Daryl is a seasoned veteran he'll he'll have material that's good for us all we're all young at heart anyway aren't we man aren't we you should be praise the Lord you got eternal life amen you're rich you're rich and the things that matter the most Hallelujah so that'll be coming up last weekend this month we're really looking forward to that Psalms 34 I want to continue by the help of the Lord today and what should be on this final installment on part three bringing you back amen Psalms 34 and we're going to start I think I told him at verse 12. and we'll go 12-16 got it say Amen what man is he that desireth life and loveth many days that he may see good that's a pretty good question keep thy tongue from evil and thy lips from speaking guile now he's he's answering the question all right start look at it again what man is he that desireth life and loveth many days that he may see good who all wants that all right here's how you do it keep thy tongue from evil and thy lips from speaking guile depart what else can you tell me David depart from Evil and do good seek peace that's a proactive word seek peace and pursue it see the eyes of the Lord are upon the righteous and his ears are open unto their cry there's an advantage you guys are being a friend of God the face of the Lord is against them that do evil to cut off the remembrance of them from the Earth father we thank you for your word today I pray now that you will help me Lord as I want very much to be able to deliver this third and final installment as it appears to me at present to be and I commit myself into your hands for service in Jesus name amen God bless you as you're seated I'm going to invite you as you're seated to turn with me to the Book of Revelation chapter 19. and you'll see that is going to be seemingly strange but you'll see how it all ties together in the end Revelation chapter 19 we're going to go verses 1 through 10. and after these things I heard a great voice of much people in heaven saying Alleluia salvation and glory and honor and power unto the Lord our God for true and righteous are his judgments for he hath judged the great which did corrupt the Earth with her fornication and hath of ended Avenged the blood of his servants at her hand and again they said Alleluia and her smoke rose up forever and ever and the Four and Twenty elders and the four beasts fell down and worshiped God that set on the throne saying amen Alleluia and a voice came from the throne um start again and uh and and a voice came out of the throne saying praise our God all ye his servants and ye that fear Him both small and great and I heard as it were the voice of a great multitude and as the voice of many Waters and as the voice of Mighty thundering saying Alleluia for the Lord God omnipotent reigneth let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the Lamb has come and his wife hath made herself ready and to her was granted that she should be arrayed in fine linen clean and white for the fine linen is the righteousness of the Saints but he saith unto me and he saith unto me right blessed are they which are called unto the marriage supper of the Lamb and he saith unto me these are the true sayings of God and I fell at his feet to worship him and he said unto me see thou do it not I am thy fellow servant and of thy Brethren that have the testimony of Jesus worship God for the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of Prophecy beautiful reading and you'll notice here that this is the time when we talk about bringing you back you know this is the time of redemption of all things and you can look through the word of God and you will find especially in Revelation you know it's not the first time you hear a group of people gathered around in heaven screaming praises to God you you get that in numerous places all through the Book of Revelation they're all uh but but here is an expanded view because now we're we're at the end and everything is wrapping up and he's he's finally put down the Antichrist system he allowed it to battle all through you know those first three chapters cover the the the seven Church age history of the Church of the New Testament everything that happens to the church happens in those first three chapters don't ever lose sight of that I'll say that again everything that happens to the New Testament bride happens in those first three chapters now say well what's chapter four and a door is open in chapter five a closed book and a call for a worthy one you know you go off into six and seven and eight and nine you're going to pick up the seals and you're going to pick up all of these you know various things you're going to come into Revelation 10 and a mighty Angels descending with a rainbow over his head and a prophets on the earth and the bride John representing a bride say my goodness what's all of that and then you you find places at the beginning of chapter 11 you see her in chapter 12 you you see the battle that's been that's still raging you go all the way over you find the message in Revelation 18. come out of her my people you find you know all of these these places after those first three chapters but brother Branham shows us in Gabriel's instructions to Daniel that everything after chapter 3 God is everything that he's going to do is in it to the Gentiles it's in chapters one two and three but now he's going to begin to ex to show the world how he pulled it off how he did it how he accomplished it and so that's why you know the the Book of Revelation can't be studied chronologically exactly it's it's it's very much crisscrossed and back and forth and you to you you'll be reading one place here in early chapters and it'll stop and you'll have to go four five six seven chapters over to to even understand how it carries on and finishes out and then drop back about Midway that'll explain both sides and I mean the whole thing you really have to study it carefully that's why you know the work that I'm I'm compiling right now though the work we finished some time ago on the entire Book of Revelation a verse by verse study well it's called the work of a thousand days it literally has taken that long to go through it verse by verse and we're compiling it now for people who would be interested we're trying to create a study guide as a as a companion study guide and uh we have podcasts planned and different things like that all right enough but but anyway I've said all that to say this you're finding yourself in a position where you've got the the the the full scope you've got all of God's family and everybody is hollering notice they're hollering Alleluia not Hallelujah All Through the Bible you find the term Hallelujah and only in Revelation 19 do you find uh A Difference A variation that instead of an H it's an a say oh it's just in Translation it's actually not just in Translation it's on purpose Dr Scofield picks that up brother Branham talks about that and and you'll find that that the reason that they're saying Alleluia is because now it's not just Lord you've been with us hallelujah you've helped us hallelujah you've been you've been among your people glory to God you've got us out of trouble here you've taken a sinner you know you've taken us in a Rapture and we got all and all of these things hallelujah hallelujah but now he has actually finally finally put down the Antichrist completely he has destroyed her and now everybody switches the word and it's Alleluia because you have vanquished our enemy forever there's such tremendous rejoicing over God's judgment because of all that has happened and and is happening uh to that system we we hate to see death and destruction the Lord takes the Lord doesn't even take pleasure in the death of a sinner who has reviled him the Lord doesn't take pleasure in that he gives every man and woman an opportunity nobody comes to this life without an opportunity a legit opportunity a valid not a facetious opportunity it's not that God entraps anyone and it's all fixed everybody according to the laws of election everybody gets a chance even Cain got a chance amen even Judas got a chance hold on Judas think about this son you're going to betray the son of man with a kiss there's no coming back from that Judas are you sure that's what you want to do Cain uh you're you're never going to get the revelation of your brother you're not ordained to that however if you'll just emulate his life and respect him and show respect I'll make a way for you too see so nobody can impugn God for if her injustice people march in the streets all the time for legitimate Injustice and not all of it legitimate but a lot of it is but there's going to be nobody crying foul at the Judgment bar because everybody's going to know because he's Discerning the secrets of their heart and putting it on a TV screen a stretched across the sky and nobody can cry foul or Injustice there and so it's not that that the people are rejoicing in death and destruction of people but they're I tell you I'm going to be very happy to see that system destroyed that system of antichrist that has plagued God's family oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah and the and the beauty of it is we didn't go through it all but if you if you can't keep reading on down you we came down I think it was to verse 8. because it is this destruction of the Antichrist system and the marriage of the Lamb are joined together and now they're rejoicing Alleluia because the marriage of the Lamb has come God destroying the system is part of the marriage Hallelujah say I'm already being invisibly united you're right and he's already putting down the Antichrist system and the Rapture of the church and the tribulation ending in the oh my when we said come to that time Friends of the Millennium all is peace forever more Hallelujah and then after that the devil must be loosed for a little season and then finally even he's annihilated from that and all sin is completely gone out of existence oh my what a time I tell you something friends our future is bright don't ever underestimate what God has in stores Paul said for them that love him one man has said a rather famous man would surprised me he actually had a a number of wise sayings it's interesting because he almost single-handedly you know corrupted uh the the minds of men and especially women and even men through style and fashion was Versace but he had a way of looking at life that was notable and he makes this statement he says I am not interested in the past except as the road to the Future so in other words I'm not living in a rearview mirror you know because we all know we've got failures don't live in that come up out of that go forward rise up go forward say well this happened to me and that happened to me if you stay there and cry over it you'll die crying over Hallelujah don't let that you're you're a human building the image of God meant to soar in the heavenlies don't let the enemy say but I I got to learn from the past good that's a good usage of remembering the past we remember the lives of all these people and Paul said it's for our examples see so yes learn from the past but don't get stuck there human beings are so notorious for getting stuck at events in their past that are long ago past and they're just hung there and they can't move forward I'm gonna tell you something friends every every one of every every funeral we just preached a funeral of our wonderful little sister Zoe and and every one of them all the way going all the way back to a couple years ago when we had all those funerals in a row I'm here to tell you brother Caleb says to Joy you remember she's not behind you in the past she's ahead of you she has went ahead of you brother Eddie has went ahead of me he's not back there I'm not going to live back here he's he's gone ahead of me he just literally jumped me and now he's there and I oh my friends what an hour that we face don't live in the past go forward everything is forward what are you here's a good question we're talking about bringing you back what are you coming back to at the end of it all you know mentioning my dad I have such good memories we were such friends and we traveled and I mean by the time I was probably 17 or 18 I had already been in all 48 lower States I'd been on every U.S Interstate in the nation at least once say how in the world how did you travel that much well we worked together and uh you know I got my education I got driver's ed I started driver's ed at nine years old amen I was I was homeschooled to say I thought you went to public school oh I went there too but I was homeschooled and how to live and how to be a man how to be honest I had parents who taught me those things amen and I I can think back over all of those memories and for me they just bring a smile to me because I realize he's went ahead of me and I've already seen him on the other side the Lord showed me I went into a dream saw him waved at him he waved back I know he's there and and I I sat up in my bed it was so real I set up in my woke up in my bed sitting up waving and it was brother Eddie he was out at some distance I could tell it was him because of the way he weighed brother Eddie didn't do these it's fine for a sister but come on men put that hand up there Amen brother Eddie put that hand up he didn't he didn't play around brother Ed he's going to raise his hand he raised his hand and he did this like that stepped out of a forest that distance and I saw him and I thought it might be him and he went and I went Hallelujah I know I'll get over there and I'll say that was you wasn't it yep hahaha he was young but but you know I when I think about the his life really the only thing of that really mattered we had lots of good laughs and memories and brother Eddie loved to laugh and tell a joke and love to hear a good joke but he the things that he instilled about the love of God and the belief of this word and the unmovable absolutely Rock of Gibraltar faith in this message and its messenger have held me uh immovably held me and though I'm going to tell you those are the things that count those are the things that really matter you say did he make mistakes of course he did I know his mistakes he knew mine when I stood there at his bedside we didn't need to apologize to one another we didn't need to try to forget bygones we we could hold hands and say I'll meet you on the other side and he looked at me said however this turns out son it'll be fine that's the way he always says it'll be fine so it's it's what we do for Christ it's it's only it's only what you do with eternal value I really hope that's reaching you today what so what are you coming back to at the end of it all when you stand on that day to give an account of your life to The Giver of your life it's hard for young people to feel the impact of that I get it I was young and it's hard to when you're 1718 even in your 20s and even early married and raising kids it was still hard for me to grasp the importance of giving an account for your life to The Giver of your life when it's all over give me my PowerPoint Brothers hey man let's go ahead oh goodness let's go ahead and get started the bride triumphant bringing you back part three the bride triumphant this diagram picture whatever you want to call it I apologize that I couldn't get it bigger than that but it's called the blocks of weeks it's basically as you can see you know 52 weeks on each row so each row represents a year of your life and it goes all the way down to 90 years old there you can see here's 85 and it goes on down to 90. there's your life if you live to 90 . if you actually make it to 90 your life is just one set of blocks on a screen so now I'm hoping we can all but especially young people can get an idea of whether your life is short or long here's the key it's limited fixed all right that's that's the big point a 90-year human life in months each row is 36 months which so each row equals three years so you can see where you start at Birth you get about where the second one is there's your 30th birthday now right there is where I am I'll be 60 in August and here's turning 90 right down here in the bottom corner our church matriarch sister Gene she would be I guess uh somewhere somewhere back in right along in here hey man I hope she lives to be 190. but I hope I hope we're all on the other side by then she will live to be 190. she'll live to be a thousand at least while they measure time don't forget the Millennium is not eternity the millennium's still in kind it's a thousand years so I will still be alive in the 24th century you will see the 27th century you will be alive in the 28th Century you will be see so it's interesting when you start to I when I look at that now I go goodness gracious I've already lived all the way down and I got if I live to 90 I've just got that last what third and that's if I lived in 90. here's an interesting Slide the typical life the life of a typical American it's color-coded the top layer is early years I'll read these for you they might be difficult for you to read this one also goes down to 90 years old early years look at that whole big chunk of elementary school man I hate it so bad wasted all that time Elementary School man that kept me in prison so I'm gonna go early years prison Middle School High School College a little bit of that graduate school no uh but I but I but I but I'm in graduate school now amen career oh boy so many memories it's it's somewhere I would say since I went to college late with my oldest son we went together from about here to about here I went to six of seven continents spreading the gospel it was all those weeks all these weeks were in in throughout Europe and Africa and Asia and different places I'm coming down to retirement of course my retirement will be like brother Eddie's retirement I said dad you're ever going to retire he said I do every day what does that even mean he said I I go out and I work I get really tired I come home I rest I go back out the next day and I retire and at 80 years old he's still talking about getting plans and planning jobs and getting a crew and but this is life yeah this is this is you wherever you are on that trust me it goes quick it goes by just like that amen and you wonder how I remember there was a a an actor I saw interviewed and he was he was old in his Advanced 80s and he he had just uh made a scene and I and I saw a clip of his interview and they're saying because it hit the headlines because in the in the in the scene whatever the movie was he broke down crying for real he was supposed to cry it was in the script but he actually broke down for real and they said wow that was that that something hit you he goes it did and they said you know his his line that made him break down was he's that he's in a conversation with another friend who's old and he says you know I've arrived at this age Without Really knowing how I got here and he broke and he started sobbing for real and I I told my dad that story it was years ago when I saw it and my dad said you have no idea son how relevant that is to me at my age hear it you can't read it I'll do it for you famous deaths famous people who chased fortune and Glory who perhaps said in churches as young teenagers and

or what's her name Marie how much older than you probably 20 or you were probably in your 40s in Florida hey where you are now Mom and she was maybe you were maybe in your late 40s probably somewhere early 50s so somewhere around in here where Elvis and JFK are checking out and osama's getting popped Michael's dying I'm sorry that's a rude way of say it amen I apologize I I don't want to really be funny Michael Jackson these are tragedies these are tragedies these were human beings who were born as little children and and had her had a right to get all the way down here and go home to a reward say what is their reward God knoweth I'm not here to judge them it's not my job thank God all I can do is Judge the word I can tell you what the word says see but while while these are are perishing from the earth sister Gene having one whole church is in her 20s is still winning people older people older than her still winning them to the Lord she's coming down here now now she's she's passed jobs and past Lincoln she's down all the way down here at the bottom and she's sitting here today with the neighbor and she's got two or three more neighbors that come to her house for Bible study to me this is called using your blocks wisely see I I use this just just to try to help especially the young people get some perspective that life is limited brother Ernie used to always say remember brother any Villanueva but I gotta go faster but I don't want to go fast if I have to if I need a part for I will just sit with me okay you good brother Ernie Villanueva told me that he had a dream that affected him as a young man when he first came to the Lord and he it never left him the impact of it was on his life for until his life was over and he said I had a dream brother Jason one day I was standing at the Judgment bar off to the side watching and he says I was grateful that I didn't have to go in front of that judgment boy said I knew I'd pass from Death to life and he says I'm standing off watching the procession and every time someone stepped up man woman boy girl didn't matter whenever they stepped up he said the king spoke to them from his throne and he had only this question what did you do with the time you had when you knew I was coming and he said one by one they bowed their head and walked off no reply what did you do with the time you had when you knew I was coming that's a question that occupied brother Ernie's mind constantly what drove him to go around the world win souls to Christ into his dying day are there any probably one more souls to Christ than anybody I've ever met on a one-on-one not talking about preaching from the pulpit but one on one brother Branham says in the message things that are to be I love that title he said it means so much nowadays Church means so much to us to see ourselves positionally placed in Christ because he was getting old and he said as I see the sunset of My Life coming up and he said it means so much to see ourselves positionally placed in Jesus Christ now if we are those attributes of God we cannot live by Creeds we cannot live by denominationalism we must live by the word because the bride is part of the bridegroom like any wife is part of her husband and when a child of God when that predestinated and he says that's a bad word to use but it's when that predestinated it's a bad word to use but it's God's word here in the in God's Bible it is a Bible word the knowledge of God can predestinate and make everything work to his honor when that predestinated seed now watch this when that predestinated seed that was that that you was to be and God called you and that little Eagle of a seed in there did you know you had an eagle seed heard the word of God it would it will when that happens he said it will build word on top one word on top of the other on top of the other on top of the other it'll not mix with any Creed it'll be a vessel built from the from the ground up it'll be built by the word of God you know religious Creed it's it's interesting that you know the the real believer won't won't mix with that won't tolerate it won't mix with it we try to persuade people to come from it but you have to be careful friends because you know standing up and saying we're not done we're non-denominational look the devil doesn't mind you holding that sign up it doesn't bother him a bit see we know that there are far more implications even than religious Creed so it's not just about I mean I'm going to say sure I won't I won't you know go along with religious Creed I want the pure word the word only but but it's not but remember that the Bible says of itself it testifies of itself that that it teaches you that to know him is life not even know the word the Bible itself says that it's not to know the word but to know the author to know him is life it's not it's so fine we don't hold to religious Creed but what is it that you are holding to is it something that's really real and then it's even more than just religious Creed my what if it's political what if it is political the message has made made us Politically Incorrect decades ago get used to it long before it was Unthinkable and made people cringe the family of God is always in every era they've been politically incorrect because they don't go along with the times you know I I heard uh at brother Samuels meeting on Saturday Brother Ray made a statement he said you know young boys young girls how should you dress and conduct yourself he said it's super simple it's not hard he said whatever you see the world doing don't do that you see the world you see these women dressing the way they dress okay sister don't do that Brothers you see the way men are don't don't be like that see it's not hard it's not rocket science the message has certainly you know I remember to my regret to my regret I remember growing up and always trying to avoid making people cringe or feel awkward but I mean today to cringe is everywhere I mean you can't do anything without somebody cringing or feeling awkward I I wish I wouldn't have wasted so many of my weeks in hiding be brave I wish I wouldn't have wasted so many of my weeks in hiding I thought sister Debbie and I were talking about that eulogy that brother Caleb paid to his daughter and there was all of his brothers all those First Responders they they're almost as many of them as everybody else they'd come to support him to support a brother and show solidarity Caleb so brave bravest eulogy I've ever witnessed to have something so tragic that it goes off the scale and there he stood still through tears admitting I don't understand that but I know I know he loves you I know he's true and he he stood for the word unashamedly Hallelujah I thought what an impact should I be not talking about that brother Caleb what an impact that would have to have on all of those First Responders to see him stand there and glorify God in the most painful moment of his life it's just a joy with him in the family with him I wish I wouldn't have wasted sister Debbie made that comment he said Caleb is so unashamed everywhere he goes everywhere he preaches everywhere he talks on the street no more where he is he's unashamed of the gospel of Christ the world we live in today I say I wish I wouldn't have wasted so many weeks in hiding because the world we live in the world that our children are coming up in the world that our teenagers our young teenagers and even our older senior youth who are beginning their journey through life as adults you know in this world um where it's hardly you know whether it's right or or or normal or not just not insane that's the world we live in well you you're trying to find something normal you're actually straining and you have to look near and far just to find something not crazy that's the world our children and our teenagers and our senior youth are coming up in and Satan's pressure on us is always you know oh you need to follow the mob the crowd Satan's pressure it's a mob Satan's pressure on us is always to adjust our thinking to adjust our thinking I want to say this to you don't do it don't adjust your thinking he wants us to adjust our thinking on child raising he wants us to become more politically correct he wants us to be he wants us to be more politically correct on the difference between men and women and the positions they hold in God's economy God has it spelled out very clear there is no ambiguity in his word concerning the position of a man in the position of a woman and how to raise a child and how a marriage should operate and what a nuclear family should look like don't give in to that political garbage don't give in to that social agenda we're not hearing sound I don't give in the political correct I don't give any religious Creek good for you but what about all the rest of it you're living in a mad world and there's only one answer there's only one mind and that's the mind of Christ reject that nonsense they know nothing of how to raise children they know nothing of how to run a marriage they know nothing about those things they've gone insane and the Bible predicted they would it's only the bride of Christ I'm going to tell you something friends it's only the bride of Christ who has the mind of Christ these things apply to the believer don't just think they apply don't think I'm preaching to the world today I'm preaching to you actually I'm preaching more to you because you're the target you understand he Satan already has the herd obedience he already has heard obedience in the world and they're all following his his pied piping it's only the but remember it's the Bride of Jesus Christ that stops his Advance it's the bride that holds up the word and says you will not come any further than this not as long as I'm here on the earth I'll resist you and I'll Hold You from taking your ride on that fourth horse you can ride you can have at it when we're gone but while I've got kids here while I got grandkids here while I go to church here we're going to preach the unadulterated word of God we're going to compel you to believe it and compel you to follow it I'm happy to be in that group of God's elect I'm happy I'm a happy man in this position to uphold the word of God brother random says when that predestinated seed that was to that you was to be and God called you in that little Eagle of a seed I read this already there heard the word of God see it will build on top one word on top the other one on top the other one on top the other one so he he actually says that you should ask God yeah you want victory I'm gonna give you a magic formula I'm sorry Aladdin's formula won't work to open the treasure rooms of God you can say open sesame all you want it won't work there's no magic in incantation except the one you're about to hear that came from a prophet and he says ask God ask God to pile word on top of word on top of word on top of word until you become into the full stature of a son or a daughter of God hallelujah those are the magic words you need Lord power word on top of word on top of word push out all the world and the political and social nonsense but see that that's assuming you're a believer of the word which is and and we're not talking about mental acceptance as I've said to you before there's a vast difference between agreeing with true Doctrine and having a revelation of Jesus Christ made plain to you the big difference the difference to be noted see so so believing the word is receiving the word into your life otherwise it won't do you very much good to invoke those words even though they're Supernatural words although it was coined by an authoritative messenger sent from God himself won't do you any good even though I've read you the words of the signifying angel that you read in Revelation 1. a signifying angel a prophet from the future this is what John was was caught forward to the to the Lord's Day see and he was given this signifying Angel this Prophet from the future who was in fact as he was so much like the Jesus John knew that he kept falling down trying to worship Him see but a faithful prophet kept redirecting his worship back to God away from himself as any true Prophet would do see and so that's that's how true Prophet would so when you see in Revelation you know all through the 22 chapters of this you know that that this anointed tour guide was going to take John through of course John represented the bride you know John represented the bride who and and and because the Book of Revelation is the bride's book of the last day because it came back after all the apostles were gone that's why they don't quote from it it's the bride's book of the last day it had all the it showed all the history it told the future which would end up being the history it told the history before the history it happened and that includes a Last Day message coming to take the last day bride and perfect her and bring up all the Sleeping Saints amen so so it's uh it's John who represents a bride who would literally be those who are alive and remain at the very last stage and that it's to those who this mystery will be revealed to and in this case of course it's the word of God that does all your thinking and all you're doing does he does he have that position in your life that he does your thinking he does your doing he does your responding how do you respond to the word of God how are you responding to it today what thinking of Christ see the key is in seeing the true word of God is a person that's the key that's the real key to seeing that you know we're not we're not talking about mere Doctrine on the text of a page we're talking about a person of the word Christ revealed to you personally you know whether it's religious whether it's social whether it's political I mean what if it is social there's a social agenda are you willing to are you willing to stand out in Social unpopularity are you willing to get dislikes if if Zuck will ever release dislike icon are you willing to have dislikes I'd like to have a gazillion of them so you don't want people to like you know I want people to love me so I can win them to Christ but not at the expense of my faith not here to compromise with the devil I don't need an Armistice or a treaty with him I want him dead and I wonder I want it to start in me I want him out of my life and I want him out of your life Hallelujah so ask God I would say to you today if you see it as a person and not just as text if you see it as a person then ask him say pile word on top of word what are you saying Lord give me more of you more of you more of you more of you less of me say where do I start brother Jason we'll start with agreeing not right there and say Lord I'm no good but if you'll come into my life right now I promise I'll give you my whole heart my whole mind I can't live in the past I've made too many failures but I'll go forward Hallelujah he says God is able God is able to prepare us and to give us that Crave in our heart that we want to see something how many in here once more of God [Applause] why it goes to show there is more for you you're craving it your little birth pains are coming on oh mind birth Pains of life life is hard and getting harder the world is dark and getting louder getting darker but arise Shine for thy light has come Hallelujah he's able to do that it goes to show there's more for you you're craving it your little birth pains are coming on see you need more so that we can be happy and free and perfect we got to be I want to be happy I want to be free I want to be perfect oh I gotta I gotta okay I'm gonna turn the corner for home all right it was unbelief in the in Genesis in the Garden of Eden that demonstrated its catastrophic effects and all they did was accept one little tiny three-letter word that was contrary to the original word the word not you shall not that's not what God Said in the day you eat you shall surely die and the serpent said You shall not surely die and one word I'm here to tell you something friends we must not underestimate this as a principle don't let the devil alter your thinking even one iota one jot one Tittle one mark one punctuation don't let him poison your mind with religious Creed political Creed social Creed I don't care who it is what it is in whatever form don't underestimate the power that Satan can get in your life by by looking at any word of God too lightly oh it doesn't matter it does oh it matters say well that's just an old book well it still matters well that's just a prophet well that's just brother Brandon's opinion you're going to go to hell thinking that you'll certainly go in the tribulation thinking that I promise you because that's the message that was sent to give us a body change how you gonna get it if you disbelieve it or water it down there is no such thing as message late [Applause] there's no such thing you don't move the ancient landmarks that's the pressure that's upon us I resist that pressure we stand on the ancient landmarks of the word of God and we're not moving for political agenda we're not moving don't let your mind get poisoned by those things nor should you underestimate what God's word when it's believed can do for you I'm here to tell you can deliver you it can heal you it can raise you up it can rebuild you it can bring you back Hallelujah to every say to what to everything God ever imagined for you to be he had a vision of you say today power word on top of word bring me back to that Vision that you had of me before the foundation of the world never underestimate God's desire the desire of his heart and what he wants to do for you and through you and what he wants to bring you to say can you tell me what it is I actually can it's the same vision he has for himself I mean that's why the all his vision was the kingdom that's why that's why kings in the Bible would say said to this one I'll give you to the half of my kingdom the king wasn't saying to Esther I will I'll split the kingdom 50 50. and we're going to need to have a you know a contract in case we get a divorce and we're going to start divvying up everything now 50 50 is the world's way yeah see it wasn't to half the kingdom wasn't didn't mean that that the king would Grant to the queen to the half of his kingdom meant that she would have all of it and he would have all of it and they would have all of it because they would become one and that's the real measure of this word that's why devils are afraid for you to get this in your heart today when you become one with the mind of God then every demon is subject to you and that's where Jesus said I have given you power over all the power of the enemy they asked Billy Paul one time said brother Billy why do we not see the kind of miracles on scale that were in your daddy's Ministry he said I'll tell you what the problem is he said the problem is that nobody lived as consecrated as my daddy here to taste something friends there's power in prayer there's power and dedication there's power and consecration I say Lord by a word on top of word on top of word bring me back to the vision you had of me Christ restores back to the original image in this age and whether it comes just before the body change or after the body change what difference does it make one of the day Prophet said we'll sit down under a tree on the other side and think about all the nonsense we worried about on this side so you'll sit down under a tree and just laugh first thought that'll go through your mind when you cross over glad a prophet could tell me that first thought that'll go through your mind when you cross over is why was I ever worried Hallelujah you understand friends that God is bringing you back to an image I should be done in 10 minutes don't run out the door I said that last time nine people went out give me 10 minutes stop running in and out don't do that young people teenagers don't do that don't run in and out go to the bathroom get a drink of water come in here and sit down stay here if you have to go out fine but my goodness sometimes that door looks like a looks like a herd of cattle going in and out say is that in your notes no but it's in my heart stop doing that it disrupts people around you disrupts the Holy Spirit it disrupts the flow of the Holy Ghost you're grown-ups I get a baby has to go out of course because they're a baby I get sometimes people on medication I get elderly people I understand that not saying you can never go out I've had to go out but I'm going to tell you something when I was raising kids they went before church and they didn't go again until after church unless I was convinced it was an emergency and they knew not to ask unless it was an emergency and being boys I could go in to stand behind them and make sure it was an emergency and if it wasn't oh [Laughter] I say that to loosen you up just a little bit but Moses built the Tabernacle I want you to catch this I'm just making my last couple of points I probably will just have to uh go over 10 minutes I'm going to try not to so Moses built the Tabernacle from a finished product in heaven the one he built on the Earth was a replica of the finished one God built in heaven and he told Moses make sure you make this one thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven thy will be done in this earth as it is in heaven the Tabernacle that he sees me as in heaven he's trying to get this one to look like that one that's what the Christian walk is all about it's not about you deciding what you will do and not do and what you'll believe and where you'll go and what is not about that it's about coming into it and it's already finished I'm here to tell you that Temple is our of you of that image is already there it's all you already have a representation just like the New Jerusalem we we find that Brethren shows it's already built the gates of gigantic Peril are already hinged and the ones who built it stand there and awe and and the only thing it's waiting is for its Believers and it's redeemed and it's family to throng its streets I'm here to tell you he's able to get you finished because your representation is already finished say why is he doing this in my life and why is he doing that and why won't he Grant this to me why won't he give me that give me that because he's looking at a blueprint and he's trying to bring you back to that image so your buildings this is why you're Building Supplies come down from above we preached almost some time ago he all good things come down from above the father of light so it's good it's good material he's just trying to get you to choose it choose to accept could I say this in my closing statements please start choosing to accept his better idea for you it's all good everything that comes down from God it's all good no matter what it looks like now that's why I read Psalms 34 what man is it that desireth life and loveth many days that he may see good it's the man who will depart from Evil and seek peace and pursue it and and and and watch over his tongue and watch over his lips and speak no guile so what is it you want out of life I realize when I hear famous people who are old and decrepit and they're about to die and they get asked the question what do you think about life after death oh I don't believe in life after death so what do you believe no this is it so how do you feel about that I'm mad as I'm mad as anything but they use the other word why because I you know I love my life and I like living and I don't want it I don't want it to end I'm so glad today that I can say my life won't end he that believes on the Lord will never die Hallelujah brother Branham said that Jesus was saying that I go and prepare a place that where I am you can be also he's saying to his disciples that life is not ended in death that that the next world is just a continuation of this same life hallelujah oh that's the life I want God gives us every opportunity he gives every opportunity Humanity to live in the Earth the way God made it I want to say this to you he's unchanging and maybe I could I'm looking at my last line on my notes you're okay looking right at it I got four four lines ahead of it he's unchanging he has a single vision to move you to perfection and let me just tell you he's unrelenting I'm sorry if I made that sound like some great promise I mean it as a warning he has a vision of you and he is unrelenting until you accept it perfection say well I I'm not sure that what he would think of as Perfection as what I would think of his view is so much higher than yours you're a fool to not trust him with your life say he can see over the next Mountain that I can't see he can see over all the mountains you can't see he can see beyond areas you can't even see the you can't even see the Galaxy you live in and it's one of the smallest and you're lit I was telling Sunday school class today Earth is a little constellation of planets on the outer ring of the Milky Way we're not even in the center we're like way away in fact is that if you were NASA says that if you were to saw this the other day NASA says if you actually this made me think about the new you know in when the new city and there'll be no night there and and NASA knows that if we were in the middle of the Galaxy he said when you look up at this is an astrophysicist he said when you look up at the sky you can see maybe three maybe four thousand stars he said if you lived in the center of your own little Milky Way he said you would see hundreds of thousands of stars and they would be so bright that there wouldn't be night it would be always day Hallelujah there's more stars in the in the universe than there are grains of sand on every beach in the entire world and it's ever expanding oh you wonder why I say our future is bright friends live for that and the Very God that created all of that and Earth is just a little pet a little speck and the god that spun all that has that waiting for you and I I would say his idea of me is much more perfect than my idea of me and his plans for my life would be much better if I just followed them sometimes I know that that they're working and moving in our lives in ways that I don't know maybe we would interpret as Troublesome maybe sad or maybe difficult but I really think that a lot of times that those kinds of things that that are troubled in our lives and difficult you know we're talked about we're told not even thinking that fiery trials I'm telling you what a lot of times I find it is is God seeing a vision of you and looking at you in real time and saying I'm going to have to tear that loose from him he's not going to lay it down she just won't lay that down I'm going to rip it and it ain't gonna feel good I'm going to tell you something friends he's unclogging us that's what he's doing the the purpose the purpose is flow the purpose is so that you can walk around on this Earth and be a conduit to him that that you are literally the word of God made flesh in the earth you're you're completed you're completed construction is irrevocable it's irreversible I'm here to tell you this is happening this is happening and he won't be defeated he's not going to let you defeat his vision coming to pass in your life and I just say glory to God I say Alleluia Allelujah may he destroy all the works of the Antichrist in my life in your life in our teenager's life in our seniors life in everybody's life hallelujah how many want that today let's stand to our feet and rejoice in this great truth Lord God the Lord God Of Heaven has brought his plan into effect in your life today and all he needs you to do is sign on the dotted line and agree that from this hour you will let him how about how about everybody in here voluntarily volunteer to retire from being the general manager of your universe say Lord today I retire I'm no longer one I don't even want to be the general manager of my world I want you to be the general manager the king the leading Spirit the guiding force is that your desire today oh my goodness I finished praise the Lord Hallelujah you love the Lord let's sing brother Anthony praise God we're going to let them go after we sing a song or two amen you believe the word you accept it oh it'll do you good it'll do you good
