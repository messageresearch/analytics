Just uh so glad to be here. Just want to say just to give an update for my dad. He is um doing really well and uh he's actually doing uh just phenomenal and we're just uh believing I believe with all of my heart that prayer changed everything. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And uh we we went through quite a little last 48 hours um there from Sunday uh Sunday afternoon all the way through yesterday or Monday when he was uh discharged. and uh he went and got a very good report. She and his cardiologist we were there with him um today's Wednesday, Monday. So um we were there Monday and um and all I can say friends is that it's just the grace of God and the mercy of God. &gt;&gt; But the cardiologist had such a good report doesn't uh concluded there was no heart attack. Um in spite of what signs he was exhibiting, there was no heart attack. They think it was some type of veagal spasm from overexertion. And uh if you were here on Sunday, he was overly exerting. And so, um but uh but anyway, I just wanted to give that report. He's doing very good. I'm sure he'll give more details to that tonight. He was determined to preach tonight. And uh and I was determined not to let him. And uh but he wanted to so bad, but he actually just was had every intention of doing it. But you know that stay in that hospital of no sleep at all, you don't really sleep at all really caught up to him like a ton of bricks today just in the afternoon and he just wasn't sick at all. He just felt wiped out uh from from from the days in the hospital. So we also have a trip Lord Will be going this uh this Friday to travel to minister meetings there for brother David McGiri uh in Texas and Dallas Fort Worth area Bedford, Texas. And so he wanted to be well rested for that. And so um I was obliged to take the service uh on short notice, but that's all right. Amen. You love the Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. Did you come to see him? Amen. Good to have brother Jason, Sister Amy back with us uh traveling, but good to see them. I think they rolled in just right before service. So good to see them here tonight. If you have your Bible, Matthew chapter 12. I'll have you turn. And I'm gonna title this sermon tonight um get rid of your rats or getting rid of your rats. &gt;&gt; Matthew 12 verse 43. When the unclean spirit is gone out of a man, he walketh through dry places seeking rest and findeth none. Then he said, I will return unto my house from whence I came out. And when he has come, he findeth it empty, swept, and garnished. Then goeth he, and taketh with himself seven other spirits, notice this, more wicked than himself. And they enter in and dwell there. And notice what Jesus says. And the last state of that man is worse than the first. &gt;&gt; Amen. Even so shall it be also unto this wicked generation. Amen. Maybe you have a need upon your heart. You just want to make a hand. Lift that hand up. Hold it before the Lord as we just bow our heads. Jesus, Lord, you are our refuge, our strong tower. You've proven yourself, Lord, time and time again. Father David said, "When my heart is overwhelmed, lead me to a rock that is higher than I, Lord." Lord. And that was, Father, just days ago, we were in that condition. But Lord, we found the rock that is higher than I, &gt;&gt; Lord. And you intervene in a supernatural way in this church, Lord. We, as your children, give thanks for your wonderful works, Lord. You never, Lord God, cease to show yourself real and alive, Lord, by infallible proof. I pray, God, that you would just be with us now, Lord, on this Wednesday night service, Lord. May you just be near, Lord, and be real to each one that's here, Lord. Father, the ones that are present, the ones that are streaming. I pray, God, that you would just come and minister to your word, Lord, to your people. We long for it tonight. We pray, God, that you'd bless it. We pray in Jesus' name. Amen. You can be seated. I sent a uh slide, brothers, if you could just have that those quotes, uh that would be awesome. I want to just read you because I know that this title um can uh can cause some people to squirm. Uh but so I just want to read just to give it some context here. The way the Lord gave me this sermon was just really uh quite sudden and supernatural. So I just want to look at this here for a moment. We'll come back to our scripture. Listen to what brother Brandham says here. And this sermon that I've I'm reading from uh would be a good one for you to listen to if you haven't heard it in a while. I just gleaned through it and I'm just catching some of the highlights from it to minister this thought. Brother Brandham says in this message, why is it that so many Christians find it so hard to live the Christian life? 1957 in March. Now, what happens when the old spirit has gone out of a man? The Bible said the devil has gone out of the man. He walks away in dry places. You give me that microphone, Brother Ken. I forgot to put on the the headset and so I'll just use that one. I know Brother Brad don't want me using this one. So, we're going to switch out. Amen. Is it on? Praise the Lord. You got me. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. You got me. &gt;&gt; Mic check. One, two, everybody hear me. &gt;&gt; Spirit has gone out of a man. The Bible says the devil has gone out of the man. He walks in dry places and comes back to find the house all swept out. You know what happens? Well, you once lived in an old ten can alley. That's right. Where all the devils and rats and everything else lived. fusses and fights and stews and arguments. But when the Holy Spirit comes in, he can't live in a place like that. &gt;&gt; That's the reason people today can shout and scream and go on but live any kind of a life afterwards. &gt;&gt; The Holy Spirit when it moves in, it takes God's I love how Brother Brandham says this. It takes God's big bulldozer and comes down and digs that old alley up, throws the dirt out, buries it in the sea of forgetfulness, and terraces off a nice big place and puts up a great big mansion. And he lives there. Aren't you glad he lives there? and the flowers of love, joy, peace, longsuffering, goodness, and mercies and kindness and faith is blooming around this house. Brother Brandham says, "Glory, when the Holy Spirit moves in, the 10 cans and rats, lies, backbiting, selfishness, indifference with other Christians, all move out." How many believers we have? &gt;&gt; How many believes that the Bible says, "Whoever is in Christ is a new creation. &gt;&gt; Old things are passed away. Behold, some things have become new." It's not what the Bible says, but it actually says, "All things have become new." Listen to what he says here. "And if you" He says, "Of all indifference with other Christians." And if you've still got them, it shows the Holy Spirit has never terrorist out your life. Amen. Get rid of your rats. How many want to get rid of the rats tonight? I think this is amazing. And I'm just going to pause that just here for a moment because even the Bible parallels the unclean animal with what Jesus refers to in our scripture in Matthew 12 of the unclean spirit when an unclean spirit goes out of a man. And so it uses this destructive animal like a rat. doesn't the Bible doesn't use the rat. But if you click on that word unclean spirit it it it it actually is connected with sin which is or leprosy a disease which is connected with sin. If you know anything about leprosy it is an oozing wound. It's something very uh physically to even look at uh would would gross you out to see a person with leprosy. It was it was something and and it's no accident that God would type sin with the disease of leprosy because though you may not see it visibly on the outside, but what sin has done to that person who is addicted to alcohol, addicted to drugs, addicted to sex, addicted to, you know, any kind of vice, what that person might look like on the outside is all very different than the spirit that is living in their temple. or their house. You see, who you are, as we know, is not what we always present from the outside, but there's a man on the inside that is controlling the man on the outside. Can you say amen? And so that man on the outside, that little rudder, as brother Brandham uses that scripture in James talking about the tongue, that how that that little bitty rudder uh control an entire ship. And the prophet says, "See in your ship as a little man in a little control room, and that's who's pushing the buttons, and that's who's pulling the levers is the man who's in that little control room controlling your vessel." Now, I I want you to notice this here because the Bible in Leviticus 11, it speaks of the unclean animals. It it talks about creeping things and things that were uh considered sinful or symbolized sin, things that were considered unclean. Uh even as as the Bible speaks of uh swine in this way, speaks of uh uh pigs in that way. It's a picture in of uncleanness similar to what we find in rats. And you know what's amazing about a rat is a rat actually is made from God. This is how God makes him. That he actually thrives in filth. Think about that here for a moment. &gt;&gt; That a rat actually's environment thrives in what we would call filth. Isn't that just like the devil? He thrives in filthy atmospheres. &gt;&gt; He thrives in filthy places. That's why you'll always find Brother Brandham talking about that about clubs. He says the same thing about bars. He talks about bowling alleys and movie theaters in the same way. It was not the place or the building, the brick, the mortar, the shingles, the drywall. It was the spirits of filth that inhabited those places. That's why there are some places that a Christian doesn't go. Can you say amen? There's some places that we don't go because the Holy Spirit inside of us isn't comfortable in filth. But there's some places that we do go because the Holy Ghost is attracted to to to to the house of God. He's that's why we gather in a building like this and we create an atmosphere because it invites the right kind of spirits in our midst. &gt;&gt; And so the scripture talks about this that that it it was a picture of uncleanness. And and and it's amazing. I'm just going to give you some of these natural facts here about rats. Rats multiply rapidly. One pair of rats can produce thousands of rats in one year. Now, I want you to think spiritually. Don't think uh you know in in such a natural way. We lived uh actually there for a little while with some rats in our attic. Lived you've sure have have been in homes before where you're laying in bed at night and you can hear rats moving through the attic or rats moving, you know, underneath. If you live in a crawl space home, it's very common to have rats moving through the crawl space. Just the feeling or the the the the sense of knowing though the rat is not in your home, he's not in your bed, he's not even in your bedroom, he's just he's completely in another partition that he can't get to you, yet there's an uneasy feeling. Uh can I get an amen, sisters? There's an une uneasy And you brothers, if you'd be honest, you'd say amen, too. There's an uneasiness about a rat. What is it about a rat that we don't like? There's a an actually a nature inside of that animal that is detestable to you because that's what a rat is. He's a filthy animal and carries that filth with him. And that's why we are detracted from them. &gt;&gt; And so rats multiply. If you let them and create the right environment, they will multiply to the thousands in a year. Let me say this about sin. Sin spreads. It's like a disease. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; It is not static. &gt;&gt; Not choke tonight. It is not stagnant. It doesn't remain in its condition. But sin multiplies. &gt;&gt; In fact, sin if you give it a place will grow into such a level. I'm talking to Christians, not just I'm not I'm talking to believers. There's a reason the Bible tells believers, give no place to the devil. &gt;&gt; Resist the devil and he will flee from you. And so the thing about sin is that sin has the power if it's if it's left unchecked and it's not taken captive by the even let me say this friends even your thoughts even the thoughts that you think in your mind you got to be careful what thoughts that you allow yourself to ruminate over because Satan has no access to your soul but he does have access to your human spirit and the Bible even says that the heart has a mind. That's why the Bible says about Jesus that he knows the mind of the heart. When our spirit we know not what to pray, but within oursel we groan not knowing what we should speak, but the Bible says it this way. But he who knows the mind of the spirit, sorry, that's what it says there. He who knows the heart and the mind of the spirit. &gt;&gt; And so, Satan has no access to your soul, but he can access your human spirit. And you got to be careful because it may not be God's thoughts. And it may not even be your own thoughts. It may be the devil's thoughts trying to get you to ruminate and to dwell on that thing. And let me say, if you don't take that thought captive, as the Bible says, take every thought captive uh to the to the power of Jesus Christ. Don't ruminate on it. Don't think about it. Uh but cast it out of your mind and say, "That's not a thought from my father. That's not a thought that I even thought. That's a thought from the devil and I'm going to obey the Bible and take that thought captive to the name of the Lord Jesus Christ &gt;&gt; because if you don't, you're giving place to that spirit. And if you watch sin, even sin would affect generations. So sin has the ability, iniquity, there's something about iniquity that it has the ability to multiply itself to build a garden, build a home, build a house, and live in that house. &gt;&gt; Rats, let me let me go just a little bit further about this. One rat, just like sin, can spread quickly. One rat of bitterness turns into a whole infestation of bitterness. &gt;&gt; No, I'm preaching very simple uh tonight, but uh they got I I only got this handheld, so you forgive me if I'm a little evangelistic here tonight. But there's something about bitterness. The Bible says, "Lest a root of bitterness springing up defiles." Notice not just you but bitterness infects others. &gt;&gt; You see sin is like a disease. It spreads. It's like an infection. It doesn't stay with that person. But if you come under the influence of a sinful person and you subject yourself to that atmosphere, you'll find sinful ways in your life. &gt;&gt; Rats uh also destroy. Listen to this. Rats destroy more than they eat. &gt;&gt; They chew wires. They chew wood. They chew anything you put in their way. And they spoil far more than what they consume. You see, sin doesn't just hurt you, &gt;&gt; it ruins others around you. Rats carry diseases. The bubanic plague spread largely because of rats and fleas. And no one likes fleas any more than a rat. But there's something about this that even even the the spirits when they were cast out of Legion requested that they could go into the swine. Have you ever thought about that? They requested that they can go into the swine because why? It was a host. It was a willing environment. It was a like environment, something that they could dwell in. So what that man though he started out as a good man, brother Brandham said he was a father possibly. He he said he was a good dad to his children, a husband to his wife. He didn't start off legion. That wasn't even his name. But the Bible said the Bible says that when Jesus asks him his name, he says my name, our name is Legion, for we are many. So now one spirit has multiplied to 2,000 spirits. &gt;&gt; But let me say this to you, my brother, my sister. He didn't start that way. Brother Brandham said he was a man and loved his children. He says, but maybe his temper, he never got subject. He never brought his temper under subjection to the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Says in another place, just drank a little social drink here once in a while. Took a social drink and you don't realize it ain't got nothing to do with the alcohol. Ain't got nothing to do with the glass. Ain't got nothing to do with the ice. Ain't got nothing to do with the brand. It has everything to do with the spirit that is hiding behind that alcohol &gt;&gt; that comes to infest your life. &gt;&gt; And you open up a door, a channel, a doorway. That man opened up access to that demon spirit and he didn't bring it subject. And that spirit created a stronghold in his life. &gt;&gt; And before you know it, one spirit turns to two to four to 10 to 20. They multiply to a 100 to a thousand. &gt;&gt; You say, "Brother Matt, what happened?" What happened was just like the spirits went into the swine, the man had let his atmosphere or his condition be that of uncleanness. And because of that uncleanness, the devil was just allowed to multiply himself in his temple. Rats carry disease. As we said, uh sin contaminates. What you tolerate or what we allow in our private life because that's who we really are. &gt;&gt; Amen. can bring poison to your church, to your marriage, to your home, to your family, to your workplace. &gt;&gt; It contaminates. It doesn't just stay there. It contaminates. And what we allow in our private life, not what people see at church, not what people see at the youth camp, not what people see at special meetings, but who you are, who you really are, is when no one else is there and the church isn't there and you're somewhere off on your own. that. Listen, friends, I'm just going to be honest with you. Uh, you want to know who you really are? That's who you really are. &gt;&gt; We might put on a good mask here, like a Pharisee, a good actor, but who we really are is who we are when no one else is watching. &gt;&gt; And so, you know, another thing about rats, rats hide in the dark. They love the dark. They thrive. Think about that. They thrive in the absence of light. when wherever a place that light can't reach, that's where they live. &gt;&gt; And and and very much the same way that sin hides itself in the dark. It stays in secret places and secret channels. Uh Ephesians 5:13, I love the scripture says, "All things that are reproved are made manifest by the light." It's amazing what happens when you turn the light on. &gt;&gt; And and and another thing about rats is rats are almost you can if you have an infestation of rats, it is almost impossible to just you say, "I'm just going to kill a rat." Well, that's fine because you kill one and there's 10 more the next week &gt;&gt; and then you kill 10 and there's 20 more the next week. They multiply. You know what you have to do? You have to remove the food source. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hello, somebody. &gt;&gt; How do you how do you get rid of the devil? Starve him out. &gt;&gt; Don't give him a place. Starve him out. You say, "I got to get rid of this temper." Stop giving him a bedding ground to to dwell in. You got to starve him out. You You say, "I got to get rid of this anxiety and this depression that's so uh overcoming me." Starve him out. Don't feed on things that produce depression. &gt;&gt; You got to starve him. you got. You can set traps. You can uh But let me say this, friends. I don't care how many traps you set. If the trash uh still remains in your life, the devil will still have a place. I can hear the prophet say, "What do you do when you apply the token? You take the trash out." &gt;&gt; Oh, how many want to take the trash out of our life and say, "God, let me take all of those things, all as brother Brandham said, all of those spirits of lies and backbiting and and bitterness and and and and anger. Lord, take all the trash out of my life. &gt;&gt; Rats can can can rats can can chew. Don't let me scare you now. Through almost anything, &gt;&gt; concrete, wood, metal, steel, fabricated, doesn't matter how you want to do it. They are destructive in nature. &gt;&gt; Amen. You can think of you there's so many examples I can give of this. But you can think of of of the way that even a farmer has a storage shed full of grain and then that rat comes in and stores that grain. But if you let a rat get in there, they don't just eat the grain, they they they they destroy it. They even just their presence in the grain soils the the grain. It's unusable. and they they'll chew through sacks and ruin an entire harvest uh for a farmer. Let me say friends, you say that's natural things, that's what lust, that's what bitterness, come on, somebody, &gt;&gt; that's what those things will do if you allow them in your vessel. &gt;&gt; They will ruin your harvest. It spoils what God is so desperately trying to grow in your life. Amen. &gt;&gt; And it's it's a very sometimes a very silent destroyer. You can you can many times uh homes you you'll see the the damage uh in the walls from the rap. And what you know you know what's amazing is most of the times man I'm just Lord there's so much in this right now I can't even hardly I can't even get to all of it. You know what's so amazing about a rat is that most of the times you'll see the damage or the evidence of the rat before you ever see the rat. Amen. &gt;&gt; And most time in people's life, the effect of sin is more. You you never know it. And then suddenly all of a sudden, they're gone. They've left. They're in the world. They've been living a double life. And you're like, "Who is this person?" What you didn't know is they never got rid of the rat. &gt;&gt; They're they're a silent destroyer and they bring destruction. And by the time the evidence on the outside is shown, destruction has already been at work. on the inside. Are you here tonight? &gt;&gt; Just trying to feel the Holy Spirit where to go from from here. It's amazing because this is exactly how rats act. Listen to what Brother Random says here. I'm just going to go through this quote unless I forget to get back to it. Brother Random says, "Get rid of your rats." How many want to get rid of our rats? &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost takes away. Notice the Holy Ghost takes away them differences. &gt;&gt; Maybe uh the next slide if you could advance it. The Holy Spirit takes away them differences. It makes you full of love, joy, &gt;&gt; peace. &gt;&gt; Look at the flowers blooming around. Satan just can't step his dirty foot on there for your life is dead and you're hitting God through Christ and sealed by the Holy Ghost. Aren't you glad that the Holy Ghost can put such a seal over your life? The rats are sealed out and they can't get in. Then what comes forth? Why the Holy Spirit's living there? These flowers just actually I love how Brother Brandham says this. These flowers just actually accompany the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You mean you ain't got to produce them? They just accompany the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; You know, that's what brother Brandham said about the gifts of the spirit. So that's the problem why we have so much impersonation with gifts because people try to manufacture them. If you really got the Holy Ghost, brother, you ain't got to manufacture the gift. Brother Brandham said it this way. A normal human will do what normal humans do &gt;&gt; and a normal Christian will do what normal Christians do. &gt;&gt; He says the flowers actually accompany the Holy Spirit. Now, you can't go and get some of these artificial flowers &gt;&gt; and set them out in the yard cuz they haven't got any life in them. &gt;&gt; And you say, "Well, I joined church. I guess I'm just going to have to be this way." You're a miserable wretch. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Listen, friends, let me tell you what the prophet's trying to say. If you if you think that serving God is I got to make myself this way and I got to make myself a better person, you are a miserable wretch. I give you the words of a vindicated prophet. The Holy Ghost produces an automatic life. &gt;&gt; It automatically loves. Come on, somebody. It automatically forgives. It ain't no choice to forgive, friends. It ain't no Well, I want to. You got to. If the Holy Ghost is living in you, you got to you're constrained to do it. Yeah. Well, I want to love. You ain't got a choice. I think we ought to change our perspective as the family of God and stop. Well, I I I want to do this and ain't about to want to. You must do it. You got to do it. If you're a Christian, you will do it. &gt;&gt; And so, Brother Bam says, he says, you can't get that old flower. But when the Holy Ghost is there, it just listen automatically loves. So I could pull every hair in her head out. &gt;&gt; Oh that old one this old trinity that old this that and the other. I wouldn't speak to her. Will I go down to that meeting? Why? Oh you old Pharisee. &gt;&gt; A Pharisee means an actor. &gt;&gt; You're only trying to act religious. If you had the real Holy Ghost in there, he'd put a love in your heart for every man &gt;&gt; that believed in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Pharisee means actor. You're trying to act like something you're not. &gt;&gt; You got an artificial flower. Your house is made up of a paste board and rats has ate it up. That's right. The Holy Ghost runs the church. Do you believe that? The Holy Ghost is the love of God. &gt;&gt; That's what brother Brandon says. While men who tried to express the love of God, one of them said, and he's going to quote, "The love of God, how rich and pure, how measureless and strong it shall forever more endure." The saints and angels song, the love of God, how fathomless, how bottomless, how endless is the love of God. And you don't have to manufacture it to a believer. It comes automatically out of your life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's amazing because he talks about this here at the beginning and he says, "Notice what you were." If you could go to the second slide, brother Joshu just bring it back up and hold it there just for a moment. I want you to notice, brother says, "Once you lived in a ten can alley." I love this. So, I want you to notice this because the prophet begins to paint this picture that one time you lived in an old alley, a ten can alley. You know, that kind of alley that no one wants to walk through at night. That's what he's referring to. &gt;&gt; That was your life &gt;&gt; before Christ. &gt;&gt; As brother Mark said, BC. &gt;&gt; That was BC. That was the BC me, the before Christ. How many's glad you got a BC, &gt;&gt; but you got an AD? Amen. A after Christ is all that matters. &gt;&gt; But before that, you were in a back alley. The kind of that no one wants to walk through. 10 cans. You can imagine 10 cans just spread out everywhere. Homeless people laying on the side of the street. All the trash all around on some back alley. The smell of garbage in the air. Rats running all over the ground. You say, "Brother Matt, you know that's grossing me out." Well, I'm trying to get you to see the picture of what your life was like. No matter how good it looked on the outside, you Facebook post looks like you got your life together. Listen, friends, my Bible says that that he that lives in sin is dead while you live. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And rats all around, people arguing, fussing, fighting, stewing, a place of confusion, a place of filth. This is what brother Brandon's referring to when he says, "You lived in an old ten can alley where all the devils and rats and everything else lived, fusses and fights and stews and arguments." And this is what the heart looks like before the Holy Ghost comes in. Full of clutter, full of of confusion, full of anger, full of sin, full of selfishness, full of pride, full of strife. But let me give you the good news that brother Brandham gives us. The prophet of God says, "But when the Holy Spirit moves in," Come on, somebody go to the next slide, Brother Josh. When the Holy Spirit moves in, it takes God's great big bulldozer. &gt;&gt; He's not there to renovate. I promise when the bulldozer shows up to your house, he ain't there to renovate you and to wash you and pressure wash you and put a new paint job on you. When the bulldozer comes, he wants to tear you down to the ground and say you get you can't build upon your old life. It's got to be a new life in Christ. Old things got to pass away. And behold, all things are become new. &gt;&gt; And he doesn't just sweep around a little bit and sweep the street, you know, hang curtains over broken windows. I'm so glad God doesn't do me that way. He's not there to put curtains and put a new paint job over it, but he takes his bulldozer. He tears the old alley down. He tears the old life around. He starts from the ground up and builds a brand new, not shack, not shanty, not some back alley. He builds a mansion, brother, because he's going to live in that temple. Amen. &gt;&gt; And you notice this without the spirit, you know, as the prophet of God says in that old alley, the dirt, the he says he buries it and then he terraces off a nice big place and puts up a great big mansion. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; And lives there. Thank God. &gt;&gt; And so it's all of this without that God removes all of those that things from that dirty alley. All the rats of bitterness, the rats of pride, the rats of jealousy, the ten cans of lies. Come on, somebody. The stink and the stench of selfishness. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Say, "Oh, brother Matt, what are you preaching?" I'm preaching that whoever's in Christ, he's a I'm talking about not a reformation. I'm talking about a real transformation. &gt;&gt; All of the stink and the stench is gone. All of the all all of those things from the past, you can put on religious clothes. You can shout, you can scream, as the prophet said, carry a Bible. Doesn't matter if your heart hasn't been cleaned. If you haven't really been born of the spirit of God, you're still living in an old ten can alley. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And let me say this to you, my brother, my sister. Your home here, your home there is only a reflection of where you lived here. &gt;&gt; Hello, somebody. &gt;&gt; That's why there will be a city. The my Bible says, "And out inside that city, there won't be no new moons. There won't be no sunrise and sunsets because the lamb is the light of the city." Listen, there will be people that live outside of the city. And the Bible says they still live by the seasons. They still live by the new moons. They still they what are they doing? They're living by the good times and the bad times, the ups, the downs, the ins, the outs. And the prophet says, "Why was it? Don't you see what it was? It's a reflection of where they lived here. Oh, but the bride is living where the lamb is the light because where she lived here, he was the light of their life. It wasn't in and out and up and down. It was a rest, a perfect rest in Christ. &gt;&gt; My work is over when I come to Jesus. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. Can you say amen tonight? &gt;&gt; And so, notice this here. He takes that bulldozer. This is the work of the Holy Ghost in your life. He takes that bulldozer and he begins to clean all of the trash. &gt;&gt; He begins to clean all of the trash and he doesn't just pile it up, you know, and take it to some kind of, you know, landfield where it could be drugged up again. &gt;&gt; He puts it in the sea of his forgetfulness. &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad God's got a sea of forgetfulness? &gt;&gt; Amen. And there ain't no bottom to that sea of forgetfulness. It reminds me of that man. Brother Brandham talks about that old man who his daughter was so embarrassed by him. All he ever all he'd ever do is shout and and shout and reading the Bible. He'd shout and scream. Every time he'd pull open the Bible, he'd just start shouting in his bedroom. And and you know, it embarrassed his his, you know, social culture daughter. You know, had friends over to the house. And brother Baron said she had all of her social friends and her her little friends. She didn't want to embarrass, you know, got to got to keep the image, you know, don't really want people to think you're a weirdo, you know, got to keep those kind of things. So, we take all the message books and the pillar of fire, we put those up, you know, don't don't give off the wrong impression. Listen, friends, I'm not ashamed of this gospel. &gt;&gt; I'm not ashamed. If you ever get a boldness and let me tell you what, if you ever realize who you are, if you ever get a if you if you get out of your identity crisis and realize you are the bloodbought uh uh spotless chase virgin bride of Jesus Christ and you know who you are, you won't be ashamed to tell people about it. You won't be ashamed of the name of Christ. You'll wear it like a robe of pride and joy to say, "I'm not who I once was. I'm not the old man that I once was. I have been purchased by the lamb of God. I'm a new creature in Christ Jesus. &gt;&gt; Brother Vam says she didn't want to. She had all of her friends over. She said, "Daddy, you know, you just be quiet." So, she took his Bible away. &gt;&gt; She said cuz every time he read that Bible, he start shouting and screaming. And so, she just gave him a geography book and he goes upstairs, you know, and every time he'd read that Bible. So, she's down there with all of her friends, you know, have all of her social friends over. All of a sudden, she hears him stomping and shouting and jumping, thinking, "What in the world?" I took his Bible away. I I gave him a a geography book. She walked in there and said, "Daddy, what are you doing?" Why are you shouting? She says, "Oh, honey." He says, "You gave me this geography book and I just got to reading about the ocean." And he says, "I just read here that scientists have discovered that the ocean actually have never discovered that the the bottom of the ocean that it's bottomless." And she says, "Well, why does that make you happy?" He says, "Because I started thinking about the sea of my father's forgetfulness that there's not a bottom to it and my sin is still falling and the devil can't find it." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Brother, you ought to make you shout. I'd make a Baptist shout to know that my sins which were many have all been washed away. &gt;&gt; Glory. God comes in and he he bulldozes that old alley and he builds a brand new mansion. a temple for his spirit to dwell in. He's not there to patch up that alley, but he's there to build a whole new house. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; And so now God further than that. Listen to this. And he puts up a great big mansion and lives there. And the flowers of love, &gt;&gt; joy, peace, &gt;&gt; longsuffering, &gt;&gt; goodness. Come on, somebody. Amen. &gt;&gt; Mercies, &gt;&gt; kindness, &gt;&gt; faith is blooming around this house. Keep going, brother Josh. Glory. He says is blooming around this house. When the Holy Spirit moves in, tin cans and rats, backbiting, selflessness. So notice this. He builds that mansion. But you know what I love that brother Brandon says here? He builds the mansion, but he doesn't just leave the yard barren. Amen. &gt;&gt; Something about landscaping, &gt;&gt; it will transform your house. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You could take a house that is beautiful, built right, looks good, but just has barrenness around it. No grass, no greenery, no shrubs, no nothing. &gt;&gt; It's amazing. It It's like the flowers and the life and the fragrance put that house in a a completely different perspective. Yeah. &gt;&gt; How many knows that I'm talking about the what I'm saying is true? &gt;&gt; And so God doesn't just leave the gu leave the ground barren, &gt;&gt; but he actually plants something there. Do you know why he plants something there? Can I tell you why? By experience. Because I've learned living on property now. If you don't plant something, &gt;&gt; that's right. That's right. &gt;&gt; Everything you don't want to grow will grow. &gt;&gt; And friends, it's the same way with sin. If you don't let the love, the joy, the peace, which are the fruits &gt;&gt; of the spirit, longsuffering. If you don't let those things grow, then everything you don't want to grow, bitterness, malice, hate, envy, strife. &gt;&gt; You see, this is the law of a garden. Our lives are like a garden. &gt;&gt; How many know that's the truth? &gt;&gt; Our lives are very very much like a garden. You remember the the the the the reading I think it was from Toer that my dad read from many many years ago and he talks about how that man is like a garden. He was made to dwell. It's why God puts Adam and Eve in the garden. He puts it makes it like a garden. It's a and and it's a garden that's protected by walls and a garden that's bringing bringing forth uh fruit. &gt;&gt; And and this is what he said. It was so powerful the way this man says this. He says, "But through sin, man was made to live in the garden. But through sin, he has been forced to dwell in a field. &gt;&gt; A field which he has that he says he's to uh dwell in a field. A field which he has rested from his enemies by sweat and tears, and which he preserves only at the price of constant watchfulness and endless toil. &gt;&gt; I want you to catch that. He says he was made to be in a garden, but because of sin, our lives, Listen friends, I got news for you. You are not living in the Garden of Eden. This is far from the garden of Eden. &gt;&gt; We as Christians have been forced to live in the field. And he says, "And now if that man he what he's what does he have to do? He has to tame the field &gt;&gt; with labor and sweat and toil constant." I love how he says says this. He says he's he's he's now dwelling in a field which he's rested from his enemies. Thank God we've we've conquered the enemies in our field. by sweat, by tears, and which he preserves. How long do you have an overcoming life? How long will my victory last as long as you're watchful? &gt;&gt; Hello, somebody. &gt;&gt; And you're in constant watchfulness. If you just lose your guard, man, you'll lose your victory. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You you you let your guard down. you before you know it, you're you're falling into sin, thinking, "Was I ever even saved in the first place?" &gt;&gt; And so, he's got to be constantly watchful. Notice, let him but relax his efforts for a few years, and the wilderness will claim his field again. &gt;&gt; The jungle and the forest will swallow his labors, and all his loving care will have been in vain. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; I just paid a a felt to me like a fortune for I had I have a drainage ditch in my property where water has to flow. It's our pond that and it's there for also for retention purposes for rain. It's the way that our house doesn't wash away because the rain collects there. Then it has an overflow ditch that goes about 700 feet and it goes to the county ditch. And I realized the pond water kept rising and rising and rising like it had never rose before. And I I went out to the ditch and realized the ditch ain't barely draining any of the overflow. The water's not getting out. &gt;&gt; And then, you know, I watched that because what had happened was most of the time that ditch is dry. If you have a wet ditch that's always running, it won't have the problem. But I noticed because that in our non- rainy season that ditch that ditch dies uh dries up and then when it dries up everything the weeds and the the the you know all kinds of just uh things that you don't want to grow in there wispy pond grass things that are just real coarse and no really you know just a just a a junk weed and and and and that they grow in the bottom there. I noticed because of the dry season that that all of those weeds had grown up in that ditch. You could preach on that. &gt;&gt; They had grown up in that ditch. And I noticed the water was not flowing out. And I realized if I want this thing to drain to the county, I'm going to have to clean the ditch out. &gt;&gt; Amen. And so I I paid a a fellow to do some more work and he got in there with his min and he just started, you know, taking all of the all of the junk and everything that had grown. He started cleaning that ditch out and I noticed the pond started draining. Water started flowing. Water got out to the county. Things were back to normal. But his tracks there that had had where his his tractor was, they had torn up all of my good ground that I had worked on. You know what I had to do? If I just let that soil that was tealed up just remain, every weed and every plant that I had worked so hard to get rid of and paid all that money, I would be within one year in the same exact boat I was in before. And let me tell you something that happens to you when you go to a revival and you get a touch from the Lord at a youth camp. You get a touch from the Lord at a great service. Listen friends, if you don't feed that experience, you might have had a good high, but in just one year down the road, you'll be down low again with weeds all growing all around you. What you got to do is you got to clean the ditch out again. You got to take the trash out again and say, "God, clean me from my head to my toes." How many want that here tonight? Clean my spirit, oh God. Because if not, if you relax, the jungle and the forest will swallow your labor. &gt;&gt; Every farmer knows, and this is his words here, every farmer knows the hunger of the wilderness. &gt;&gt; That hunger which no modern farm machinery, no improved agricultural method can ever quite destroy. &gt;&gt; I asked Chad GPT that. Thought it'd give me a good answer. And I said, "Chad, I am so sick and tired of these weeds." And I had one particular one that I seemed like every time I'd cut it down, spray it down, didn't matter what I said, chat. And I'm asking him how to get rid of and what. And finally, after he's giving me all his advice, I said, "No, Chad. I want to know how do I get rid of it forever." He said, "Well, uh, that's the question farmers have been asking for hundreds of years." He said, "And oh, what a what a what a reality." He said, "What a great reality that would be." Unfortunately, that's not our reality. So, what do you got to do? You got to spray it. You got to dig it. You got to chop it up. You got to pull it up by the roots. And he says, "The hunger which no modern can ever quite destroy." No matter how well prepared, listen, no matter how well prepared the soil, how wellkept the fences, how carefully painted the buildings, Let the owner neglect for a while his prized and valued acres, and they will revert again to the wild and be swallowed up by the jungle or the wasteland. &gt;&gt; The bias of nature is toward the wilderness, &gt;&gt; never towards the fruitful field. That we repeat, every farmer knows. It's a law that runs through our region, all the regions of our fallen world, affecting things spiritual as well as things material. We cannot escape the law that would persuade all things to remain wild or to return to a wild state after a period of cultivation. What is true, let me say to you, brother, of the field is true of your spirit. Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; And after a while, you have cleanliness only from one time. Listen, friends, that's why we preach it's it's I believe in a one-time experience, but but it's not a one just a one-time experience. It's got to be a constant feeding and filling and refilling and dying out and emptying out. &gt;&gt; It's got to be constant maintenance. You say, "How?" Through prayer. &gt;&gt; Through prayer. &gt;&gt; Amen. through through reading your Bible, through spending time with the Lord. That's how you maintenance your spirit. &gt;&gt; Let me just say, you cannot maintenance it just by coming to church. That's wonderful. &gt;&gt; You cannot maintenance it by just veging on YouTube. Even if it's spiritual things and sermons and shorts, you've got to spend time with the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hello, somebody. You've got to spend time with the Lord. &gt;&gt; That's the only way to maintenance your field to only way to maintenance your garden. So God comes to plant flowers. He doesn't just leave it barren, &gt;&gt; but he plants a beautiful garden. And out of that soil of a a Holy Ghost saturated soil in a in a Holy Ghost saturated atmosphere under the light of the sen. Out of that soil blooms and blossoms flowers of love and peace. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Peace. &gt;&gt; You know, we all want peace, but let me tell you what what we need is peacemakers. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called the children of God." There's, you know, we need more of them, friends, &gt;&gt; more people who are who want to make peace and not strife. And out of this soil rich with the love of God, rich with the nutrients from reading his Bible, from spending time with the Lord, from soaking in and baking all the greenness out in the presence of the so and you spend time there with the Lord and suddenly out of your life blossoms and blooms of joy and peace and all of those roots of bitterness are gone. and and and and and now out of that soil you you find in in Galatians 5 it says the fruits of the spirit is love and joy and peace, longsuffering. How many want it? And goodness, faith and self-control. That's what it means. Temperance. You can control yourself. And and you know what? Here's the key. Let me just say this to you tonight as I'm just just bringing this down to a close. What the key is is that you don't have to manufacture them. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because real love can't be manufactured. &gt;&gt; You look at that word agape, agape, however you want to say that real word of what real love is. It is love that only comes through the nature of Jesus Christ. the humanly you couldn't forgive. &gt;&gt; Listen friends, there are certain things you can go through that humanly you could never say I forgive them for that. &gt;&gt; You could say it. That's a one thing to say it. It's another thing to mean it out of your heart. &gt;&gt; Can I just say that true perfect love as brother Brandham said when he goes beyond the curtain of time and said the only thing that'll be there is perfect love. So do whatever you have to do. Lay aside everything. get to the place where you can love your enemy. &gt;&gt; You can't do that. I'm just going to work it up, brother. I'm just going to keep on thinking the right thoughts about them and and don't, you know, push out the negative about everything that they're saying and everything they're doing. I'll just say the I'll just force myself and you could be a good Pharisee and we could be good Pharisees and good actors &gt;&gt; and say, "Bless their heart." &gt;&gt; But it ain't it that doesn't matter. What matters is that what's in your heart. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And the only way to have that is through the Holy Ghost. It's impossible any other way. &gt;&gt; You know what the key is about those flowers, those fruits, is that you don't manufacture them. They grow and they're real. They're not artificial. &gt;&gt; That's why brother Adam says the greatest weapon God ever gave to man, he says, in in many places is love. You take an unbelieving husband, brother Adam says, and you take that wife, let that wife love love him through that. And he says even with that love can save that husband. And then brotherham says, I love how he says he says now it's really it's got to really be there. You ever caught how he says that? &gt;&gt; You can't fake it. It's got to really be there. And all of those flowers, those flowers have fragrance and life and they're blooming. They're blossing. Not artificial. You know, artificial religion is like plastic flowers. What do you call those? Silk flowers. And they're not real. They look real, but there's no fragrance that comes out of their life. They look okay from a distance, but get up close and there's no there's really no life there. But when the Holy Ghost is inside of you, it flows out of your life naturally. Peace, love, joy flows naturally. You don't have to fake it. You just blossom. Oh friend, I don't know about you, but as I'm even preaching, I'm saying, "Lord, let it be out of my life." &gt;&gt; Don't let me be just as brother Brandham says, a Pharisee. You know, Jesus had a word for people who acted wanted to act religious. They acted really good. You know what he called them? Actors. That's what the word Pharisee means. &gt;&gt; It means an actor. One who puts on like literally an actor. And and they they an actor puts on a show. He wears a mask. All the lights go down and and the mask comes off because they because they're just acting. That's what they're doing. This is brother Adam says, "You only try to act religious. You've got an artificial flower. But when the Holy Ghost lives on you, you don't have to act holy. Holiness comes out of you. &gt;&gt; How many believe that here tonight? &gt;&gt; You don't just have to say that you love, but you truly love. &gt;&gt; You don't just talk about peace. You're a peacemaker. &gt;&gt; You carry peace wherever you go. Amen. &gt;&gt; You don't have to you don't have to uh manufacture joy, but the joy is your strength. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It just comes out of you. You love even when you shouldn't be able to love. As as as the prophet of God says when he goes beyond the curtain of time, he said they there was just such love. He couldn't even describe it or put it into words because why? You say, "Brother Matt, what is it?" It's all it is is God has bulldozed your your your old ten can alley &gt;&gt; and he's planted in you the seeds of faith, the seeds of love, the seeds of joy, the seeds of patience. &gt;&gt; And and and the Bible says, "Let these virtues be in you and abound, &gt;&gt; having been made a partaker of the divine nature." Friends, that's what I need is I need more of the divine nature. &gt;&gt; I don't need this nature. I'm done trying to beautify this nature. I'm done trying to improve my nature. I want the divine nature. &gt;&gt; I I want it I want it to come out of me naturally, &gt;&gt; not not not having to force it. &gt;&gt; Could you stand to your feet here tonight? Brothers, sisters, could you come? Musicians, could you come? Could you bow your head with me? Every head bowed, every eye closed. So, what does your house look like? What's your attic look like? What's your crawl space look like? I'm not talking about those places that you take everybody and let everybody see. talking about who who are we really call ourselves Christians, believers, but what does our house look like? Is it still that old ten can alley? Trash and stench and rats, darkness, bitterness, strife. Ain't it funny? I'm not saying old rats of of of of of, you know, of of alcohol and old rats of lust and old rats of cigarettes. That ain't what I'm talking about. I'm talking to Christians. I'm talking to believers. And your rats ain't alcohol. And say, "Brother man, I ain't got no rats. I got rid of them all." Really? What about jealousy? What about envy? What about faith? You got faith in your heart. What about love? Or has the Holy Spirit so bulldozed your old life? And maybe we'll just make that a request here to say, "God, bulldoze it." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I don't want you to try to remodel it. Don't want you to try to fix it up. This ain't a fixer upper, Lord. I I want you to bulldoze it from the ground. And I want you to build your mansion that you can live in. I want you to tear down that old ten can alley. And don't leave anything, Lord. Don't leave anything standing. Tear it all down. Send the wrecking ball of the Holy Ghost and and and tear out every corner. Tear tear out every every space that any place I've given the devil. Lord, dig it all up. Excavate it. Take all of the ground. Lord, I I I want to say here tonight, I'm not going to settle for an artificial religion. I don't want artificial flowers. I want real flowers that blossom. Real flowers that out of the character of my heart, it there's a fragrance that comes from my life. There's flowers of the spirit that bloom all around that all those who are around me can smell the fragrance of Christ. Oh, is that what you want, my brother, my sister? Yes, Lord. You see hands up all over the building. My hands are up, Lord. That's what I want, Jesus. I want to get rid of my rats. I don't want to give no place to filth. I don't want to give no environment, if even one thing, God, one place in my life that I've left. You say, "Brother Matt, you don't know. What you're preaching is impossible." You're right, sister. You're right, brother. I know that it's impossible to to say, "I forgive you and I let it go." You could do it. You could say it, but it's impossible to take that feeling out of your heart. But I know a great physician who can. I know one who does heart surgery. I know one who starts at the ground. I know one who's who was ridiculed and mocked and spit upon and yet he opened not his mouth. He was reviled, the Bible says, but he didn't revile back. Oh, that's my Jesus. And I say, Lord, so live through me. Oh, I want it, God. So live through my life. So shine through my vessel, Lord God, that I can be reviled and not reviled back. All who love God will face persecution. That's what Jesus says. All who live godly will face persecution. I'm not talking about self, you know, as brother Brandham said, not not not self-made persecution. I'm talking about persecution for living a Christian life, living a godly life. All who live godly will face persecution. We live in a world, my brother, my sister, where just as I said, just from one moment, you can go from a manicured field, a manicured garden to just a field that weeds are growing in. Flowers aren't blooming. Oh, but God can start with his Holy Ghost bulldozer. Bulldozer every complex. Bulldozer every thought. Lord, I'm raising my hands. I invite you to do it. bulldo every thought, Lord God, that I I've dwelt upon that, Lord has created maybe a thought in my mind that shouldn't be there. Jesus, take it. I I bring it captive to you right now. I'm allowing entrance. I I'm I'm not putting up any blockades. I'm saying, "Come in, Lord. Come in. I'm not keeping you at the door. I'm saying I'm inviting you into every place of my life, oh God. Bulldo any pride. Bulldo any malice. Bulldo any jealousy. Bulldo any anger. bulldo any hatred. I don't want it there in my life. Oh God, I don't want to live with rats. I want to live with the Holy Spirit. The Bible types that Holy Spirit as a dove. Oh, and I want that dove of the Holy Ghost. Give me that nature, not the nature of a woof. Give me that nature of a dove. Oh, that dove, that nature of that lamb lays down its rights. Grant it Jesus I pray. Grant it Lord. Grant it Jesus. Yes Lord. Let's sing it just for a moment. Me. Feel me and feel me. That's your prayer &gt;&gt; with you. &gt;&gt; With you, &gt;&gt; holy fire, a holy fire, burn away my desires, my desires for anything, for anything that is not of you. Yes, Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; I want more. &gt;&gt; Oh, is that your prayer? And less of me. Empty me, Lord. Fill me and fill [Music] me with you. With you. Could you gather to the front now? Come worshiping and singing. Holy fire. &gt;&gt; Holy fire burn away. &gt;&gt; Burn away &gt;&gt; my desire. I desire &gt;&gt; for anything Jesus for anything that is not of you &gt;&gt; and is of I will bless &gt;&gt; I will bless more of you and less of me and less of me empty. [Music] &gt;&gt; Oh, let's just focus on the Lord just for a moment. [Music] Oh, forget about what's around you. Just focus on him now. Fill me with you. With you. Sing it again from the top. Holy fire. Sing that now. Oh, could you raise your hands like a prayer? Oh, let's sing it to him like a prayer. Burn away Jesus my desires &gt;&gt; my desires. &gt;&gt; Can you say this? For anything &gt;&gt; for anything &gt;&gt; that is not &gt;&gt; of you &gt;&gt; and is of me &gt;&gt; than is of me. &gt;&gt; Oh, I want more of you &gt;&gt; more of me. &gt;&gt; Oh, and less of me. Empty. Granted, Jesus, &gt;&gt; Jes, [Music] with you. With you, with you, with you. &gt;&gt; Say that again. with you. With you. With you. [Music] &gt;&gt; Brother Mark Lowry, August 27th. So this is tonight, right, Brother Mark? This request here for Sister Deborah. That's tonight. Sister Deborah just had another MRI on her back. Please remember her in prayer. We're going to remember Sister Deborah. Amen. And just want to She's not here tonight, is she, Brother Mark? Okay. So, we're going to remember our sister. I just want to also add just to the prayer list just that you uh continue to pray for my dad. Uh just that he recovers his strength fully and uh he was looking good and feeling good and uh but just I think things just caught up to him there. So, we want him to be plenty rested up. Amen. And and be ready for uh for this weekend. Be praying for those services. We'll be there traveling and ministering there for brother David McGiri. I don't see any other written down needs. um here tonight just checking to make sure I'm not missing anything. Um don't think I I got anything that came in uh through the text. So if you got something you can send that to me now. Amen. Amen. Amen. Let's pray. Lord Jesus, Father, that's truly our desire that you would empty us, God. Burn away holy fire anything Lord that is not like you. Anything that is of us God Lord it's too late living too late of an hour Lord so close to home now. So close Lord to just Lord we can almost feel that we've seen a glimpse into that next reality of life. And it's so real Lord God. And I just want to say fresh once again. I want to lay aside every weight. I want to lay aside every sin that doth so easily beset me. And I want to run my race with patience. Oh God, I want to say once again, Lord, as your prophet said in the beyond the curtain of time, do whatever you got to do. Lay aside everything. Get to the place where you have perfect love. That's amazing, Lord. He didn't tell us to get to the place where we memorize scripture. Get to the place where you memorize a quote. Get to the place where you understand the vials and the thunders and the all of those things are wonderful. Lord, I'm not diminishing those. But God, what good are any of those things if we don't have the person of love, the person of the Holy Ghost. And if that love is really there, we'll love your word. We'll love coming to the house of God. We'll love our neighbor. We'll even love our enemy. We'll love living for you. Not dread it. It won't be a to a a burden upon our life, God. But that's what perfect love is. Perfect love tells the truth. Perfect love speaks only the truth. Perfect love lives for others. For that's looking eternity in the face. Perfect love doesn't allow a place to the devil for fear or anxiety. It doesn't give place through jealousy and complex, Lord. But perfect love, my Bible says, casteth out all fear. And I just want to raise a hand and say, let perfect love, let it dwell, let it live, let it breathe, plant in the soil of my spirit. Oh God, let it be saturated with the goodness of God. Lord, everywhere that I go, everybody that I meet, oh Jesus, I want that divine nature, Lord, that that inheritance, Lord, that you've given to the justified, to the sanctified, to the redeemed of the Lord. Given it, Lord, it's your promise. I pray, God, for our sister Deborah, Lord, God, with this back MRI one more time, Lord, I pray that you'd come and be the great physician. Touch my sister just now, Lord. This church binds together and we stand against an evil spirit that would try to cause suffering in any of one of your children's life. Oh God, that demon is just a tormentor. That's what is it's what he is. But we cast him out tonight by the word of God. I pray for each hand, Lord, that was lifted up here tonight. Every unspoken request, I pray that you'd come and be the need meter. Touch our pastor, Lord, my dad. I pray that you'd continue to restore, Lord, tenfold. Lord, if the devil took strength away and tried to uh take his strength, God, may you pour back into him tenfold, Jesus, I pray that he'd feel a rejuvenation and a a refreshing, Lord, like he's never felt before. Let it be, Jesus. I believe that you did great things, and we're rejoicing, and you're going to continue to do great things. And we give you thanks for that. Bless us now, one and all. We ask we love you Lord with all of our hearts in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Let's sing something just go ahead.
