God Abby good to see you amen young man happy to have you here today God bless you we're happy to have some visitors here with us want to be remembering uh brother Mark and sister Deborah Lowry she has um a younger brother who apparently is on his deathbed in a hospital in Arkansas so they left yesterday to try to get there um be with the family perhaps um I don't know what the whole situation is even this morning I don't have an an update on it but um just hold them up in prayer well you that's uh you know losing a sibling is no small thing and I know the pain of that all too well so I want to be praying for them today amen we're going invite you to Hebrews chapter 1 amen Hebrews I'm sorry Hebrews chap 11 verse 1 amen um hope you can hear me all right we had to move some speakers around a little bit this morning apparently we had some Hardware device that failed and that happens amen built by the human hand subject to failure there'll be no there'll be no wires in heaven amen no wires or Wars praise the Lord happy for that brother Brandon talks about how that it's interesting he says you know he says we won't have an education we won't have education and Science in the Realms of Science in heaven and then he his next breath is we'll have an education so much higher than this one this one would even hardly be thought of or compared amen so I'm looking forward to that aren't you you're not you are am praise the Lord amen I don't want to be there by myself amen Hebrews chap 11 verse we're going to catch 1 to three again we read this in part nine today be the 10th installment and we'll see how far we get we may get completed it's always my intention we'll just see how the Lord goes now Faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of Things Not Seen for by it the elders obtained a good report through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear so we we're learning that everything that is came from nothing that is amen everything that is in existence from the earth you stand on to the air you breathe to the Galaxy that the this Earth hangs into all the galaxies outside of that all were brought into existence by the word of God Amen and then there's a people that would live on the earth spoken of in verse two called the elders and it is through that exact same Faith whatever that is we're going to try to identify it a little closer today let's just suffice it to say that whatever it was that that created everything from nothing is what they used to to have a testimony in their life that it was a good report in the mind of God Amen now it doesn't mean they're Perfect People The Beauty of of the operation of perfect faith is is that it causes you to stand in the view of God much higher than you would view your own self amen and we find out in verse one so I've went from 3 to two back to one that this faith is definitely not just a thought it's a substance it's actually an Evidence an Evidence is an Evidence if it doesn't exist it's real it's already real amen so whatever your faith is claiming in the word of God it's already real it's not something it's not like a hope I hope it comes to pass it already has come to pass amen amen and when you are walking by substance Faith which is perfect Faith then all you're doing is persevering toward a promise because Hebrews chapter 11 is all about perseverance amen don't lose sight of that he's he Paul is trying to get us to understand perseverance and so he goes to the Hall of Fame chapter 11 of Hebrews and he starts laying out the lives of God's family down through time right and the way that they proved that they were God's family because not everybody is but the way they proved that they were God's family is that they persevered and kept going forward in the promises of God and sometimes they had their request met sometimes they had them met but not in the way they prayed amen and sometimes God offered them something and they actually refused it so that they could get something better which meant they would have to go through what they were the Dilemma they were in amen all right let's pray father we thank you this morning for your word and we are asking now for that great mind of Christ that it was would bless speaker and hearer Lord we commit ourselves into your hands for leadership today how to bring forth this thought and if this is the last installment of this series then I pray you will seal it up completely and that we can get through and make every Point correctly we commit it to you now in Jesus name amen God bless you as you are seated now I'm going to have to just go from from point to point and and I I I want to say not in a not in a an arrogant way at all I'm sure you know I'm not like that but I've I've Whitted down every point that was superflous or redundant or repeating and so what I'm Whitted down to is a line item uh set of notes of points that I want to make and I want you to come along with me on a journey of understanding will you do it give me your undivided attention we won't keep you here uh all day you know I'm not long-winded but so I want to go Point by point and I want you just to follow right with me and keep your focus so we found out last time and as we closed out last Sunday in in the uh ninth installment we found out one of the great things as we we came down to the end one of the last points I made was that I don't get graded by things that do appear now that's particularly delicious for me because I don't sometimes when I look in the mirror of God's word and I'm looking at me compared to this I don't like how I appear amen I'm glad to know that that that my relationship to this word is not based on and will not be graded on how much of it I get an A on Amen in my in my manifestation because what I will get an A+ on is I believe every bit of it amen amen and even the parts that I find that I come up short on there's an inside desire down inside of me that I don't want to come up short and there's an inside desire inside of me that says Lord whatever you have to do whatever by whatever means necessary I want you to bring this image to look like this image amen amen amen yes and so this was I think this is what Jesus was partially referring to when he taught us how to pray that he wanted the the image in heaven to look like the image on Earth let your will be done in this Earth as it already exists in heaven see there's already a representation of God's entire family not that it it came into heaven on the day they on their birth certificate that they were born but they they always were in the mind of God these are things that we understand in past teaching we're not going to recover that today so the beautiful part is is that I'm not limited to what appears and that's beautiful because then that means that no matter what the devil will will accuse me of even if he has the DNA evidence that I'm actually guilty in this flesh it can't count against me because I have an atonement which is the blood of Christ which speaks for me perpetually at all times amen and God doesn't see me he's not looking at me he sees My Sacrifice which is Christ Jesus that's a beautiful thing and therefore that means then now all right we've gone that far then that means also that that this body although it is limited to the space-time Continuum the physical laws of nature uh the rules of physics um uh but but understand that if God should determine to do something through this body it wouldn't necessarily be bound by any of those right yeah that I could if he decided to bid me come like he did Peter I could walk on top of water the dead actually could come back to life and a body that's dead and the life is gone life could come back into it incurable diseases can be disappeared amen amen I he say well what's the limits here's the limits are you ready I can do all things through through Christ who strengthens me so we know that God created the heavens and the Earth we made this point last time and yet Hebrews 11 tells us that the substance of Faith made it but I know God made it but Hebrews 11 is saying the substance of Faith made the Earth and made everything so you know so then it comes down so so then when I when I think of it like that I realize that the substance of faith is is More Than A Feeling or a thought amen then I have to conclude if God created it and substance Faith created it then substance faith and God are the same thing amen amen or you've got a contradiction in scripture so when we talk about perfect Faith it's not a feeling or it's not a thought it's a sub substance that created the heavens and the Earth it's it what it is at the end of the day is a material expression of God himself all right so the Earth is what an eternal attribute of God that's why it can't be annihilated so the Earth is not something that that God just spoke into existence he expressed the universe he expressed the Earth you see just like Brandon would talk about very scientifically you take a piece of paper this is scientifically true you take a piece of paper and you burn it and you say I have now annihilated that piece of paper but that's not true mankind doesn't possess the ability to annihilate anything out of existence all you've done when you burn that paper is you you you changed it you transformed it back to its original gases and elements uh that are on the periodic table whatever he say well it was wood before that what was it before it was wood all right so so we realize he talks about how that if time would go on long enough it could it could re regrow another tree be remanufactured and come back to paper again amen amen so so when we when we think about God creating his family we talk about how that God created man and we realize that this was God expressing his entire family and I proved to you last time that in the mind of God you always have existed because God can't have a new thought we proved that last time didn't we and so when you think of it like that then you suddenly be it begins to occur to you that if God had simply just spoken you into creation and you were not an expression of him for instance hell was created by God for the devil and his angels but hell is not an eternal expression of God it was created for a purpose and the Bible talks about it will be done away with God put it together God took it apart the body of MDC was God taking Cosmic light and poach and calcium and the other elements of a human body and he put it together and stepped into it and went to meet Abraham and when he got done he stepped back out of it disassembled all the parts you understand and that's why you don't hear anymore about MDC because he became Jesus Christ only now he's not in a in a in a body like that he actually is begotten of a woman because God speaks that same word into the womb of a virgin and it and and Child Development takes place this is why Jesus was not a demigod he wasn't a half God and a half human he was completely a human who was completely God in human flesh not a third person not a second person the very person so then when you think of it like that you realize that God didn't just create his family because if he had just and I get the King James says God created man his own image I'm not defying that I'm simply showing you that what it means is is that it wasn't like he created something uh that would then later on uh be uh could be done away with you understand so something that something that starts has to have an end only what that which never started has no end so God didn't just create you he expressed you so you came out of him that's why this came out of him and that's why I have an affinity with this not because I heard a sad story and somebody talked me into becoming a Christian or because I appreciate and and love the fine qualities of Jesus that's a fine thing to have the foolish virgin have that they they they there's Christians around the world who will be safe from destruction who admire the fine qualities of Jesus that's not the same thing as being birthed by the word I have returned to God I didn't become his son I found out I had always been his son and now I'm cooperating in the vision because the vision the word about me is me is him and it's the same thing now you're getting close close to perfect Faith it's a person yeah this is why we were promised by the Holy Ghost as I've said to you repeatedly we were not promised to have merely a faith in Jesus the world can have a faith in Jesus Christ and that brings salvation from destruction but the re the family of God are redeemed they're not merely safe from destruction they're redeemed back to God right and so so we realize then that that that when you when you start to look at it like that you realize you're always a part of something all right I've got to keep moving so now we're we're realizing what real perfect faith is it's a person who expressed himself in the universe listen friends that you are to be so thankful for that because this is the ability of God yeah you never had the ability you could turn over a new leaf and live a better life but you could never annihilate your sin it would always have a record of you that Satan could accuse you on but I'm here to tell you that God annihilated the sin when it fell into the blood of Christ it was annihilated it took you back all the way back as though you had never done it in the first place because you didn't do it in the first place cuz the first place I was was in the mind of God see so how do you know you were in the mind of God because I my whole life is wrapped up in the word that came from the mind of God and that proves my identity that I'm willing to say Amen to every word not just what a denomination tells me I can believe and limits my belief and doesn't doesn't doesn't require much more than just turning over a new leap there's all kinds of people who turn over a new Leaf that doesn't mean they're redeemed they sit in churches even True Churches even message churches that doesn't mean they're redeemed they believe God sent a prophet that doesn't mean they're redeemed it's that when you look into the word of God and no matter what it says about you no matter what the Lord tells you you've got to change the person sitting next to you might not need to give up something he tells you you got to give up but whatever he tells you you've got to separate from you to say Amen yes Lord I'm I'm marching to Zion and by the time I get there I will have given up everything and I'll be completely in your image so we're on a journey of perseverance so perfect faith is not a feeling it's not a thought it's a substance that created the heavens and the Earth it's a material expression of God himself that's why it's not human hope God expressed in the material God expressed in the real God expressed in the tangible some something that is a part of his very substance his very existence the Earth is that the word is that you are that so now I can I can more clearly see how that all creation is an is an unfolding expression of his very life and this is exactly why the Earth is an eternal attribute of God why it can never be a ated and now because I realize all of that and everything that I've just taken 15 minutes to say this is now I can I can more clearly see how he fills all time space in eternity yet he's not like the wind he is a being he lives in a house right amen he's he's omnipresent through his omniscience see so he's not like the wind so Faith's not like a thought amen it's a substance yeah he's a being he's real he's he and when he when he come in and live through Christ Christ the Bible in Hebrews 1:3 um you don't have to turn there I'll just read it for you Hebrews chapter 1 verse3 says it like this says or let me read from the top God who in sunary times or in distant times and in diverse manners in various ways in times past spake unto the fathers By His prophets and hath in these last days spoken unto us by his son Jesus Christ whom he hath appointed air of All Things by whom also he made the worlds say wait a minute I thought God created the heavens and the Earth but this is declaring that the son created it all Colossians says the same thing John the Gospel of John says the same things all things are made by Jesus Christ amen that that's what he taught to the Colossians that's what he taught to the Hebrews that's what Christ taught in the gospel it's what John records so so then so then if he who who created it was it God the father was it Jesus the son was it Faith the substance was it the word expressed yes which one uhhuh it's it's so it so then his bride is a part of him exactly now you're getting it say then I need to persevere you will persevere you're already persevering you're persevering today to believe Against All Odds I'll be there because I'm a part of him so so Paul's whole exhortation is about perseverance so when you're when we when you read Hebrews 11 and you read about all these Warriors of the faith then you realize that it's now now we're in the progression of of of of unfolding understanding you're with me still so our eyes are coming open open open and more open so then when we so now based on everything I've just said you realize that these people in Hebrews 11 who are persevering that when you read that chapter it's not just a testimony merely about God influencing human beings but it's human beings who are themselves a part of God's life and God was accomplishing his promises not that they were they don't get the glory he gets the glory see God was accomplishing in them his promises by working through them upon them and through them in the Old Testament and now God is accomplishing his promises in the New Testament by living in the people living in and through and out so it's not something that happens after you now here here's a here's my next thought when we talk about God accomplishing his promises in those people you say yeah that's right and he accomplished it through those Old Testament Saints He Came Upon them worked through them and now by the baptism of the Holy Ghost because of that day on Calvary now he lives in us and through us and it's not a temporary thing where he has to come and go it's permanent see so so it's but it's not something that happens uh or let me just say it better like like this it's not some that's not a principle applied to you only after you come to the Altar and give your heart to the Lord amen it actually the mercy of God followed you all the days of your life you understand and so so that because the whole purpose of it is to bring us back to our original nature of your life in Christ before the foundation of the world now let me just give you a few quick examples if I can get to it so there's only three places in the New Testament where it makes that term before the foundation of the world the first place well it's not the first place but one of the three is we is Peter uh give me Josh give me First Peter chapter 1 and he's going to talk about how much that we were redeemed Verse 18 1 Peter 1:18 for as much as you know that you were not redeemed with corruptible things such as silver and gold from your vain conversation received by tradition from your fathers verse 19 but with the precious blood so you were redeemed with the precious blood of Christ as of a lamb without blemish and without spot see that's all on your behalf therefore you're with without spot and blemish in him verse 20 who was verily speaking of Christ who was verily ordained before the foundation of the world look at it who verily was foreordained before the foundation of the world uh but was manifest in these last times for you so yeah Peter is saying yeah he did come he was here a few years ago however he was before the foundation of the world now the next place that it uses that terminology is going to be Ephesians chapter 4 I'm sorry Ephesians uh chapter 1 brother Josh verse four let's get verse three blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus So it's talking about the Believers all right it's not the global population it's he hath blessed us with all spirit blessing and Heavenly places in Christ Jesus according verse four as he hath chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world you've heard me say it all the time there's only one elected son according to this 42nd chapter of Isaiah there's only one elected son so then how did you become elected because I was in him he was before the foundation of the world I was in him therefore I was in him before the foundation of the world see amen and then the third place that you'll find it which is actually um chronologically speaking the first place it's mentioned is in John 17 John 17 verse 24 father I will that they also wait for the uh screen John 1724 father I will that they also are we able to get it all right there you go thank you I will that they also whom thou H has given me be with me where I am that they may behold my glory which thou Hast given me for thou lovest me before the foundation of the world so now it's very clear from John's writing and Peter's writing that Christ was before the foundation of the world and it's very clear from Paul's writing that we were identified in him before the foundation of the world there is no other place anywhere in the entire Bible where especially the New Testament where it talks about this term before the foundation when you can go to to the Book of Revelation or when you go to the 25th chapter of ma of of Matthew which we're not going to go there but you remember that the bride is seated with him on the throne and before him are the is the populations of the Earth from all that down through all time remember the great great white Throne judgment the seed gave up its dead the dead both small and great stood Before the Throne there's one seated on the throne and the the the the the heavens departed as a scroll you remember that and so you find out that that we're that the world is being judged not the bride she's passed from Death to life cuz her identity was always in the word amen so Christ being the word was judged on your behalf so how are you going to be judged if if the same word that he's a part of that you're a part of and he got judged in him why would you stand before the Judgment see so things that are may not be as things that appear I may not appear perfect but I are perfect Hallelujah why because I'm great no cuz he was great and because you say because you decided to follow him no because I was in him and I could not follow him I heard my sheep hear my voice they hear all of it there's many people who hear parts of his voice but refuse to hear all of his voice they'll suffer for that Amen in the regions Beyond especially preachers who tell people the word of God doesn't matter and you don't have to obey it in all of its dictates that that that Minister will suffer for that in the region Beyond that's a direct quote see and so so we find then that that because remember that the ones who were condemned at the Judgment bar were those who were workers of iniquity who knew the word of God said that but made a decision not to follow it the ones who who were granted eternal life whatever they did was in ignorance if they didn't follow it all it was ignorance but they really did love God see it was different than having the love of God cuz that's the new birth but they did have a genuine love for God and they will be safe from destruction amen but to them he says enter into the joys of the Lord prepared for you not before because they you're not in the group on the throne they were pred prepared for you since the foundation of the world you can go into the Book of Revelation and it says all speaking about the Antichrist the Beast system All Shall worship Him whose names were not written in the book of of life of the Lamb since the foundation of the world Amen you understand so there is a book of life Judas had his name in that book but it got it got taken out because of his betrayal of the word amen because he was a worker of iniquity so if you can arrive there and your name is still in that book of life then you've got a chance you're going to get a fair trial and and God rich in Mercy will judge people from from their heart but the bride is already judged it's already over she was in Christ before the foundation of the world see and only my point is that it speaks of people speaks of a segment of humanity that that indeed it was prepared for them and their names were put in a book since the foundation of the world but only to the elect lady only to the bride only those who are an expression of the full word does it say you were there before the foundation of the world you were identified in the word in Christ before the foundation of the world I said that one time sitting uh to someone who was contending with me and a a Baptist Minister and and he just he said to me he said are you trying to tell me that there are people in the earth who are the children of God and and there are people people in the earth who are the children of the devil excuse me and who are children of the devil and I said well I don't teach that he said well I'm glad I said but Jesus did that's not my Doctrine but Jesus when he's asked about the parable of the S it's simple he said the Earth the the seed the field is the world the seed is the children of the Kingdom the one that Seth them is the son of man the weeds are the children of of the evil one or the wicked one and the one that slded them is the devil so I'm sorry you don't you don't have to believe me but you need to believe him see all right you still with me so when I when I look at it like that then this explains it explains the in inexplicable things that followed my life that followed your life amen and I I I get to stand up here today because I got the microphone and I can tell you about a few instances in my life but so could you you could also tell of times before you came to to Christ before you came to your senses and escaped your spiritual Amnesia before you got the baptism of the Holy Ghost there was always something a prophet would say that you were always different something about you even when you were running with the crowd and doing everything about them you always felt a little bit like an outsider we're not talking about whether you enjoyed it or whether you did it whether you rebeled in it we're not talking about that but there was every time when you went to sleep or you woke up and you sobered up you realized something's wrong something's wrong but the the world never comes to that they're just like I love it I'm going to keep doing it but to the Son of God to the daughter of God no matter how hard you run no matter how long it takes takes surely goodness and mercy will follow you all the days of your life it explains events that can only be explained by the supernatural it explains to me how I sat in I had a prayer place in the woods as a teenager out behind our house and my mom knew I would I'd leave out of the house and I'd have my Bible and she'd see me and I'd have my dogs and we'd disappear into the woods she was never worried she knew where I was going and I had a secret place couldn't find me it was a a laurel Thicket had grown into a perfect circle and it looked impenetrable until you went through it and then it was an open area and it was just a beautiful perfect place and it explains to me why when I was sitting there praying and I've got my Bible in front of me and I'm praying Lord I just want to know what's this pull why do I feel this in my life what is it you want me to do I was only 15 years old what is it you want me to do maybe 14 15 something like that and a wind comes through which should have really been impossible it just seemed to dip down in there and just swirl around and I heard my pages going and so I just with my eyes closed I just stopped it it was going I just stopped it I finished my prayer Lord please tell me what it is that you want me to do and I finished praying and I looked down and my eyes fell on you shall be a witness unto me in Jerusalem Judea and Samaria and the uttermost part of the earth you shall receive power after the Holy Ghost has come upon you you shall be a witness to me Jerusalem Judea Samaria the uttermost part of the earth and and and I I understand now why that happened to me and might not have happened to my neighbor friend right it didn't make me better than him it just meant that I had a different origin see it informs my thinking when sister Jean tells that I mean how many times the enemy tried to take my life before I could stand here today and preach you all and as a baby I I I I contracted uh rise syndrome which is colloquially called brain fever it's not kind of a misnomer a little bit do doctors would know that but it it just basically rise syndrome is a is an inflammation of the of the liver or the brain because of when you're sometimes when a child or even a teenager is recovering from an infection like chickenpox or the flu and you give them aspirin that's why they say don't give them Aspirin because then that can have the wrong kind of reaction and for whatever reason and and anywhere from a third to half almost half uh that's fatal right and God preserved me and and I still have a pretty good mind I [Laughter] think I I I almost I almost drowned twice growing up and I'm an expert swimmer I swim like a fish and I almost drown twice went too far out overconfident almost couldn't get back in twice both times I thought I'm not going to make it and somehow I just kept putting one stroke and after the next and the next thing I know my feet hit dry land and I you know and and and in the second time it was my kid brother who actually swam out and saved me brought me a a float and when he brought it to me I realized I was just panicked I didn't even need it I handed it back to him he was gassed from Power swimming out I swam back in and it just the the the enemy trying to trying to take my life that happened so many times so many times I you have those same stories I remember one time B running out of a place I had oh boy let me not get too too transparent here I was just very young and and I'm in the wrong crowd and I'm I'm I'm in that crowd sister Jean was always trying to keep me from and I'm I'm you know something breaks out and there's a there's a conflict and and somebody you know pulls a gun and I'm running and you're you're hearing shots go off and you're hearing the conc you're feeling and hearing the concussion go right by you now you think you're already running full speed when that happens but I promise you you can run faster see but friends if God is following us like that then then this means that even when Satan obtained a seeming victory over one of God's children he still couldn't win it it means that this is precisely why even in Failure that those of Hebrews 11 even when it looked like Satan won he couldn't win even when it looked like they had a failure you can read in the Bible where his family had plenty of failures but even when they had failures they couldn't fail even when you have a failure you can't fail even when it looks like Satan got a victory over you he still can't win because no word of God can be stopped and you're a part of that word and that's the part of you that can't ever be lost that's the part of the word that no matter what hold Satan has on one of God's family the truth is he can't hold them forever because you recognize that you are a part of the same word word that created heavens and earth I say it unabashedly I am part of the I came from the same word that created the heavens and the Earth see so that you know that that's why I mean when a when a when a prophet is told and he's he's seeing people behind bars and the the Lord says you know free those people and he says well how how am I going to do that my little skinny arms and he said those great big iron bars and he said people were just beating their heads insane and the Holy Spirit said free those people and he said well all I could think to say was House of Hell give way to the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and he said popping and creaking and busting and bars collaps and people began running out I'm here to tell you you ran out of there I ran out of there because House of Hell giveway works from you it works for me if you got children if you got a family to say house of Hell give way in the name of Jesus Christ you got a problem in your life say House of Hell give way that includes me that that friends that is perfect Faith let me say this in case I forget to say it at the end why this is a 10-part series why would I make the last probably five or six parts of it a part of a series called uh where where we're opposing the Judgment of Heaven because as I've said to you though you live in a world where everything that God is for the world is against amen they demonstrate to be against it yeah everything he's for and everything he's against they demonstrate and pass laws to give themselves everything he's opposed to so how are we going to escape it you're not there's no ability that you have that can overcome this world only perfect Faith so it's necessary to show you today yes the world rejects it yes the world is going to be destroyed yes they're going to their destruction it's irreversible it's irrevocable they're headed there by all possible speed but I'm not going down with it Hallelujah I plan to go up to a meeting in the air and I'll do that because I've understood the operation of perfect faith that it's a that it's the very substance of God moving through me see you you claiming the promise of the word in restored Fellowship then there's nothing that can stand before your prayers on any promise of God Amen it's not just to a prophet let me say it again when you are claiming the promise of the word and you're living in a restored Fellowship then there's nothing that can stand before your prayers when you claim any promise of God Amen this is very this is the very Foundation that principle is the very foundation on which perfect faith is built because perfect faith is based on this Supernatural reality of God's being that I'm a part of him it's not about a human hope that he'll perform his word his word and he are the same thing and he lives in me therefore I and his word are one therefore I can claim a promise and it comes to pass am see so all promises in the word that have ever been made or ever would be made they were made in Christ before the foundation of the world so they operated in the Old Testament family of God for thousands of years before that day on Calvary and Calvary itself made it possible that what had been done under a temporary substitute could now become a permanent reality in his family that's that's part of what the Holy Ghost is given for amen every thought indeed of Our Lives was fixed in the mind of God Before Time and nothing can stop it you say even my mistakes and failures let me just say this let going say it in two part part a god knew you'd do it Part B God knew you'd repent God knew that would happen so he sent Christ to go ahead and live a perfect life on your behalf so he wouldn't count that against you and the only part of his vision that he counts is seeing you repent and seeing you come back to Faith see you did all kinds of things in your former life but Mercy see surely goodness and mercy was following you even then see so nothing can stop it that's why Romans 8 says but if we hope for that we see not then do we with patience wait for it so when human hope operates without perfect Faith then that's exactly why brother brandham said hope is the greatest hindrance faith has yeah because we're talking about we're not talking about Hope in a a revelation of who you are and who he is and everything I've been preaching on but human hope that hopes that God will decide to do it I I'm not asking him to do it I'm asking him to give me the Revelation It's Already Done amen so I would say if he was standing here in this suit and you were sick and he would say my child you say Lord please Heal Me You' say I can't do that cuz I've already done it 2,000 years ago everything in the atonement was made for his family at on that day at Calvary so true perfect faith says that the promises of God uh are Eternal and therefore if they're Eternal then they already are amen because they already are when we pray then you realize now that it's a deep calling to a deep that the the reason you want to be well is because there is a wellbody representing you the reason you want to see his word come to pass in your life that's a deep inside you calling to something that is that already is not might be can be someday it'll be it is already see and so so even even if the and let me say it like this I so I was so appreciating by the Caleb's Sunday school class today and and and fact is right when I was looking at this very note brother Caleb was preaching on this very thing even if the Deep desire hear me well even if the Deep desire that I'm calling for for whatever I happen to need even if that deep desire that I'm calling for doesn't match what God has for me then he grants my prayer according to his perfect will even when it's different than how I prayed yes amen amen amen does that make sense so I I I pray from a deep desire because I see the perfect plan of God I want to I want to achieve that I by his stripes I'm Healed I can do all things through Christ which strengthens me greater is he that is in me than he that is in the world Amen and I desire that to be manifested in my life what if I might need a healing if I might need a Deliverance if I might have a lost loved one I'm praying for them I'm praying for them I say God I I want you to bring them what you know if if truth be truth I'm saying God I'd like for you to appear them right here today as a Christian right right amen because when you love somebody and you want to see them in you don't really you're willing to wait but you don't want to wait but maybe God knows there needs to be a little bit of time he's working on something this is why perseverance not human hope but a hope that says it's already real it's already a promise and I can claim it so it it might not come exactly the way that I desired when I prayed but it's still God meeting his word brother brandham has a perfect story of that you remember the the the lady there um she was um I think she was an American but she was in Germany cuz her husband was in the Air Force and stationed there she had a baby that died and she already knew that numerous babies had been raised to from the dead in William brenham's Ministry and before Witnesses by doctor's statements they had been raised back from the dead there are some witnesses that talk about his meetings and there'd be five or six ambulances parked in a row and he would have to leave the platform and go out and climb in the back of ambulances and said nearly every one of them were already dead and when he climbed out they were alive amen so this is something that was done in the corner these are verified stories of thousands of witnesses and so when her little baby died she immediately said brother Brandon will you come I'm in Germany my husband will send a a transport plane to pick you up fly you there and bring my baby back to life and he said well sister let me pray cuz I can't decide to do that that's not perfect Faith perfect faith is persevering because you know God is and you know that whatever he has said will come to pass but however he lets that go through your life that's his Sovereign will see that's what that's what real perfect faith is that's how Jesus operated perfect Faith Jesus didn't walk around deciding who to heal he said that I the son does nothing but what he sees the father do then the son does that so that's why he comes to Betha to the pool steps over sick people heals one man and leaves you think my goodness did he not have power he had power to heal every one of them forever he had power to give them Immortal Life right there they'd never die again he had the power to bring everybody out of the Grave who had ever died but he only brought one man Lazarus he said I always do so so the whole idea of operating perfect faith is not is not elevating you in your mind that I'm up here now it's on me it's not even up to Jesus anymore it's up to me it's always up to Jesus our Allegiance is always to Jesus it's never the bride when he says she is him she she's the same as him meaning she believes the same as him she lives the same as him he did always that which pleases the father that's her desires see so you you have to keep your balance in that so when brother brandham said I'll pray and when he went to talk to the Lord about it after so many had been raised from the dead seemingly there was never even one that failed suddenly the Lord says don't touch that that's my hand I got a purpose in that leave it alone and the Lord and so brother Brandon called the sister said sister dear I'm sorry but God has refused said he's got a purpose in that I he didn't tell me what it was but that's his hand we're just going to bury your baby yeah you'll see him again you won't won't matter you're a Christian you'll see him again see it's just like it's just like you know I I I was so appreciating the story there that I I saw a a a clip just yesterday or or day before and it's where there where Jesus in The Chosen is talking I think he's talking to Big James and he Lord why haven't you healed me of this Affliction and he says because the father has decided that you can give him more Glory even by remaining in it and he says but so that you are healing other people even while you yourself Jesus was like that Jesus said to the audience he said I know what you're going to to say you're going to say physician heal yourself Jesus himself was afflicted the Bible says he learned obedience by the things he suffered amen amen so just remember it's not the it's not the you know the whole fairy tale sometimes that they tell about a Jesus story he was a real man who got tired and got hungry had a headache whatever and and and brother Bram talks about how many times he said I've prayed for hundreds of people and see every one of them healed and me standing there so sick myself I could hardly stand up amen and I love the way that uh Dallas did that and he says and he starts to turn away and he turns back and he says James you will be healed amen it's only a matter of time and that was such a a moment I thought my goodness that is true we will all come to that complete Perfection of everything that God gave you to desire every deep calling within you that believes every promise of God you'll have it it's only a matter of time am see so so she comes and then he says bury your baby well it was sometime later they're back in the US she comes to see him she says brother brandom was my faith she was you know beating herself up my faith must have not have been strong enough my faith must have not have been genuine or real and brother B said sister your faith was perfect the fact that you could take God's answer against something that was the greatest desire of your heart you couldn't have a greater desire a mother for her baby to live and he said but that you accepted the will of God in the matter prove that you have more faith than all these other people running around here who know nothing about accepting that's perfect Faith that's perseverance that's Hebrews 11 see amen so we find that that your faith Against All Odds no matter what they are against any circumstance it catches the word for your hour and refuses to let go that is real faith that something inside you that looks to the promise and you see it happening it that's that's not I hope you're taught well enough now by this 10th session by this this 10th installment I hope you're realizing enough to know that perfect faith is not mind over matter amen it's not you gritting your teeth and trying to speak something uh into existence because you want it to be so bad perfect faith is walking in the will of God no matter what it is you still know it's a promise you still know it's only a matter of time you still know it's already in existence you still know that the devil can't win you still know that you can't lose you've received the word of this hour that's perfect faith and that's what the world is opposing and that's why because they're opposing it both sides are opposing it doesn't matter who got elected both sides of the aisle oppose the Judgment of heaven and that's why this world must pass away and there's going to be a new world where Christ Christ rules and Reigns and all of the population will receive the laws of God Amen it's not mind over matter it's happening because the Deep call in your heart is contacting a reality that's already existing in God this is why in our text Faith is the substance of things hoped for the real actual evidence of Things Not Seen so gen Hope from God burning in your heart that presupposes perfect faith that it doesn't matter sometimes you think I don't I don't know if I have perfect Faith the very fact that that this that there's a hope in God and you believe his word that automatically tells you how do you think you got born again amen amen you received a revelation of Christ in the word that was the operation of perfect faith that wasn't something you could do on your own Millions walk down billions walk down and make a decision for Christ that doesn't mean they're born again you might not have even attended a meeting at all you might have been in your car driving down the road and God began to visit you and you begin to cry out for mercy and right then and there God birthed you a new and you became a new creation in Christ see so genuine hope that is operated by the Holy Spirit then we are we are we are confident that we shall have the promis made material you see because all I'm doing here here's here's where perfect faith is perfect faith says I'm here and and I I have something I need from God and I I don't have it right here but I'm hearing in the word that it already exists forward it's already real so then what's perseverance walking toward it I'm just walking all I'm doing I'm not hoping it'll come to pass I'm walking to where it already exists I'm walking to where it is you understand that I'm walking to where it is you want something from the store here you got to walk to where it is I'm it the answer is not just on the way it is already in existence it's already in a place and perseverance says just walk by faith and claim the promise and keep believing no matter what it's only a matter of time see that's true perseverance doesn't matter if it's a day two days a week a month a year however long I'm not hoping it will happen I'm persevering in faith to get to where it already is he you know you you will receive it you you have to receive it it's only a matter of time so this friends let me let me turn a corner and go to the finish line now looks like I'm going to maybe get done with this series this is exactly why in perfect faith brother brandham talks about an attitude of expectancy that's not his language that's just the the overall thought that he's trying to bring bring about that there's an attitude of anticipation a Readiness you know uh for God to move at crucial times in your life you're you're perpetually believing the word of God you another Point brother Brandon would make is that he he you know he repeatedly warns against the the det m al effects of doubt and fear you remember when Brother David was preaching Wednesday about separating from the world forsaking all amen and I it never occurred to me I wrote a note in my in my notes I told him after service at Brother David never thought about applying that to our faith because when when we when you ask God of something you have to separate yourself from all unbelief which means you deny circumstances it doesn't matter circumstan might exist here but I'm believing they're not going to exist when I get over here see so I have to separate we've got to act as if it's already done that's not psyching yourself out that's a revelation that it's in God it's in the word I'm part of the word I have a right to believe it I have a right to accept it amen see so in essence when we talk about operating perfect Faith it's about aligning your thought thoughts your words your actions with the absolute truth of God's word it involves an unwavering confidence in God's promises it it is a it is a refusal to entertain doubt and fear amen that's a choice yeah it's like you hear this the the statement happiness is a choice people choose to not be happy and there's almost nothing you can do for them happiness is a choice it it it h happiness is not based on whether you're getting everything you want or whether things are even good there are too many people down Through the Ages who have suffered and refused deliverance and they were happy in the Lord and happy to go to their death amen I mean you can't get you're not going to give me a case that exceeds that see so so we realize then that that it's a willingness then not only to refuse doubt and fear but it's a willingness to step out in faith expecting God to move that's why it's hearing recognizing and acting upon the word of God brother Brandon makes this statement and I'm I'm I'm truly wrapping up he talks about how that every creature he says I seen God baffle a bull one day I've seen him cause Hornets not to sting I seen him raise aosome from the dead Every Creature the gospel will take effect upon anything that you you ask see and so he he was using the operation of perfect love and you remember love and perfect love and perfect Faith are are like husband and wife they're married remember that so so they're they're one so he's talking about now you say oh well that bull that was going to kill him he used perfect Faith he used the the wife of perfect Faith perfect love see amen and so and and and he talks about the Hornets and a love came over him the man that jumped on the platform to to to kill him a love he said I felt sorry for him now here's what he here's a statement he made you can't manufacture you can't create that you can't fake that because the devil will know see he says it like this there's a big point something came over me yeah now do you think that's something whatever it was it tamed the bull it tamed the Hornets it tamed the murderer amen it brought the posum back to life it brought the fish back to life it brought it healed do do you think that that something that came over him could have come over him if he didn't have a life dedicated to God do you understand why I say that perfect faith is the mind of Christ operating in and through you without hindrance amen because you have sep separated yourself from the world you've dedicated yourself to a consecrated life you're in your Bible you're in prayer you're in church you're around the fellowship this is the secret to the operation of perfect Faith it's not something we're looking for coming under the seventh seal the seventh seal simply revealed to us it restored to us the truth that it had been since Genesis and this is what Joshua operated to stop the sun this is what this is what Elisha used to float an axe head on water this is what job used to overcome his trials he used this Revelation I'm preaching to you about that that that that it was all in God's hands and that he was part of God and he said I know my redeemer liveth at the last day I'll see him that's part of his Revelation amen his perseverance kept going so there's so much to live for friends there's so much of the Eternal to be had and enjoyed I want to say that to you as we get ready to wind up here there's so much to be had and enjoyed I'm not talking somewhere over a rainbow I'm not talking somewhere under some great mystery sermon I'm talking about it's available to you right now to live above the world to cast out fear separate yourself from unbelief and and let God move in your lives I promise this world that is rejecting his judgment you're going to have to be able to operate that or you're not going to survive it you're not going to you won't you won't survive it amen let's stand let me read you this quote from perfect faith and then I can say I'm officially finished with this series I made it how about that perfect Faith August 25th in the evening service remember the morning service how can I overcome and he says in the evening service in perfect Faith this is coming into that third poll I'm believing it now I want to ask you a sincere question you that passed through the prayer line you can actually did he just say prayer line and he's talking about did he just put the third poll in the prayer line in the same sentence did he just put perfect faith of prayer line in the third pole in the same sentence yeah see see how silly that argument is can you actually believe and feel now that there is something happened in you since you've had hands laid on you and he says raise up your hand there it is this is what we've waited for now this is not this is just starting to bloom now this 1963 this is just start starting to bloom now see I just started with I did this for a purpose I did this for a purpose I'm working out something see it's taking this charge of faith and going right back to begin and come in see to kind of raise faith in a bracket where you've never noticed it that way before not a faith but a perfect Faith Build It Up build it up in here I love this and watch a perfect god with a perfect heart keep a perfect Promise by his perfect word it's sharper than any two-edged sword discerner of the thoughts of the heart what we're coming now to the Perfection because the people has to come to this in order for the Rapture that's what's holding it away right now is waiting for that church to come into that perfect raptured Faith looking for it listen what he says now you're going to now you're going to hear him explain why he started the that Sunday this is his second sermon on that Sunday in August now you're going to hear him verify why he started the thought with how can I overcome he says that's what's holding it away right now is waiting for that church to come into that perfect raptured Faith looking for it here it is it means a lot of Shaving down for me it means a lot for you but together we'll make it by the grace of God bow your heads with me today Lord I feel satisfied in my spirit and I I think I see clearly the direction that you're moving in Lord I I pray today and I I committed myself to you before coming out here because it seemed strange the way you wanted me to deliver this today you wanted me to just be very methodical go slow take your time say it clear I I I kept I kept taking my foot off the gas when I felt myself moving too high in a preaching gear I just backed down lord I wanted these statements to be clear and concise in the people's minds I want them to have a clear understanding of it Lord and why we need it in our lives and it's going to take a lot of Shaving down if a prophet said that about him it's certainly true about me and these folks here today I pray Lord God that I I I I don't want to stand up here and say oh Lord God pour down your spirit and your power and let us operate the impossible I I want to say Lord help me to have a shaving down today help us Lord God men and women boys and girls teenagers single married oh let's raise up our hands to him friends and say Lord whatever it takes whatever you have to shave off of my life how can I overcome I've got to be willing to be shaved down by the word of God I've got to be there's no sense fooling myself anymore we're not waiting for something over a rainbow the end of all things is upon us and is at hand Lord we want to have that Dynamic Spirit flowing through us unhindered I know that there's things in my life that have hindered and would continue to hinder but I want I and I know there's and if that's true about me it's true about these people and Lord that being the case we're not trying to hide and be arrogant we're trying to say Lord help me help me oh God have mercy upon me give me that power if if I want a power give me this power that that I would be willing to lay aside every weight and sin that death so easily beset us so that we can run this race with patience grant that to us Lord that would be the greatest thing that you could do for us Lord perfect Faith isn't about me walking around do trying to snap my fingers and do the supernal natural it's about like you did you did always that which pleased the Father the prophet taught us in perfect faith that you were able to operate it on two principles number one you knew who you were we've spent a lot of time solidifying who we are in Christ that if we didn't just become a Son of God we had always been children of God that revelation of who she is is how she'll do the Greater Works we're taught that it's how she becomes an in ible Army but the other prerequisite was Lord that you had no condemnation in your heart you said Satan cometh but he has no claim on me he findeth nothing in me there's nothing in my life I do always that which pleases the father Lord may you help us to come into a place in our lives where we can move aside the things out of our life out of our home we know what they are we're we're standing here in this building right now mortal beings and our heads are bowed and our eyes are closed we know what they are we know what they are maybe we have other people around us fooled but we can't get away from our own understanding of the things in our lives that we allow in our lives and it hinders perfect Faith from flowing I pray Lord God that if this series will accomplish anything not to just teach us what it is and how to operate it but but that it will cause a great desire to be in our hearts Lord I just raise up both my hands today in a fresh surrender and I ask you grant that to us Lord God that's the desire of our heart today that we would be ready and willing
