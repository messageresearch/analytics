[36:49] here in the house of god today
[36:51] amen i hope you uh are comfortable in
[36:53] the new seating arrangement
[36:55] we had a need to put more chairs out we
[36:58] were
[36:59] a little crowded on the sundays and so
[37:03] came up with this idea in order to
[37:05] accommodate
[37:06] more chairs but also leave plenty of leg
[37:09] room for a little bit of distancing
[37:11] we want to carry on with that and so
[37:14] this was the one i come up with that got
[37:16] approved by the design committee chief
[37:18] so uh i appreciate her signing off on it
[37:22] and that's not sister debbie by the way
[37:27] it's second in command sister rachel so
[37:30] amen praise the lord we we're happy to
[37:33] have her help in these things
[37:35] she's got some great ideas for things
[37:38] that we want to do
[37:39] plan uh plan to do coming up amen good
[37:43] to have
[37:44] brother dawn sister mary still here with
[37:45] us brother don's going to be ministering
[37:47] for us wednesday
[37:49] and boy are you in for a treat i gotta i
[37:51] thought well if the lord don't change
[37:53] him
[37:54] i got a little taste of some of his
[37:56] material and ministers breakfast
[37:58] yesterday and it's gonna be really
[37:59] delicious
[38:01] amen now of course that's subject to
[38:02] change preach you don't get to decide
[38:05] that right brother don we have to
[38:07] we get our we get we don't get to decide
[38:09] what we say
[38:11] we don't get to decide what we think
[38:14] i've had the lord rebuke me openly for
[38:16] things he wouldn't rebuke you at all for
[38:18] and he would say to me no no you don't
[38:20] get to do that
[38:21] you see that laity mike can
[38:24] put move do get away with that but
[38:27] you're you're an officer you've been
[38:30] selected you've been reserved unto my
[38:32] service and you don't get to think your
[38:34] thoughts and speak your words and do
[38:35] your ideas
[38:37] so boy it in one way it's a little bit
[38:43] makes you a little anxious but in the
[38:45] second way it's a great piece
[38:48] once you learn to slip into that
[38:50] slipstream and just glide with it
[38:52] amen then you fear nothing really
[38:55] because you know that the
[38:56] never failing presence of jesus christ
[38:59] is with you
[39:00] amen as long as you're in in duty for
[39:02] him and you're
[39:03] nothing hindering uh in your life and
[39:05] you're on the word and you're
[39:07] operating by divine commission there's
[39:08] no power in hell that can stop you
[39:11] and so you take great confidence in that
[39:14] i have tremendous confidence in the word
[39:16] of god today
[39:17] to meet every need that you have and
[39:19] then some
[39:20] and say well and then some yeah because
[39:22] there's needs you don't yet know you
[39:23] need
[39:25] amen but the word has a way of pointing
[39:27] it out and preparing you
[39:29] for what you might face before you can
[39:32] get back to church again
[39:33] amen god bless you we're going to invite
[39:36] you to second timothy chapter four
[39:38] thanks to all the music and the
[39:39] wonderful singing and worship
[39:41] sure appreciated that got a number of
[39:44] prayer requests that were sent to me
[39:45] personally i want to take up

[39:55] two verses there in seven and eight let
[39:58] me give you these prayer requests
[40:02] i have a request to continue
[40:06] um we want to continue to pray for our
[40:09] brother joe
[40:10] carter he gave me an update this morning
[40:12] both doctors feel
[40:14] that my lung condition is still not in
[40:16] shape to do
[40:17] open heart surgery i have been put on
[40:21] two different
[40:21] medications to try to improve my lung
[40:24] condition
[40:26] at the end of the day my cardiologist
[40:28] believes that we have no choice
[40:30] but to do the bypass okay
[40:34] well there's a doctor that's higher than
[40:36] that cardiologist all right
[40:39] no problem if that's the lord's way no
[40:42] problem we don't fear the devil
[40:43] amen um lord willing
[40:47] this next six weeks of medicines will
[40:49] improve my lung condition
[40:52] so right now we have to put it off by
[40:54] six weeks stay
[40:55] oxygenated stay medicated we'll
[40:59] we'll be doing bi-weekly visits with
[41:02] doctors
[41:03] amen now we started agreeing with our
[41:05] brother joe
[41:06] for his complete deliverance and i don't
[41:08] intend to change nothing
[41:10] i believe we're going to continue to
[41:12] believe for
[41:13] everything amen sister chastity writes
[41:16] in for a couple good friends i would
[41:18] like to ask for the church to pray oh
[41:20] one is her sister
[41:21] uh cindy wood she is having a liver
[41:24] ultrasound on tuesday at 11 her labs
[41:27] came back very bad and they are worried
[41:29] about liver damage my she's only 31.
[41:31] also please pray for a friend named
[41:33] donna
[41:34] huff her liver also is failing she's now
[41:36] in hospice and only a few weeks to live
[41:38] i believe god can still perform miracles
[41:40] i think we'd say amen to that
[41:42] and her family needs prayers during
[41:45] this time um
[41:50] so also
[41:53] so brother anthony and sister amber are
[41:55] not
[41:56] here today and i was i told brother
[41:58] anthony i'd leave it up to him
[42:00] but i think he wants all of us to pray
[42:02] and uh
[42:03] sister amber seems to have uh
[42:06] the asymptomatic um positive covid test
[42:11] and she took three different ones they
[42:12] all came back positive she's
[42:14] asymptomatic completely he's not sick at
[42:16] all but um that then is going to cancel
[42:19] there it had a big anniversary trip
[42:21] planned and
[42:22] and now they're going to have to delay
[42:23] that and uh and so it
[42:25] throws a wrench in church schedule and
[42:27] so how many pray for sister amber
[42:30] the whole family amen we don't want to
[42:32] see that
[42:33] move any further than that and just
[42:34] arrest the devil on the spot
[42:37] amen amen the devil never comes along
[42:40] quietly so the lord don't even worry
[42:42] about it
[42:42] he just walks up and slams him and cuffs
[42:44] him and hauls him off
[42:45] amen so i want to see that done
[42:49] for our sister amen all right that's
[42:52] all the prayer requests i have we'll
[42:53] pray for these once we go
[42:57] to prayer also could we pray for the
[42:59] saints in india brother samson shetty
[43:01] who you all know has ministered here for
[43:03] us numerous times
[43:04] lovely brother and in fact as we
[43:07] actually sent some money out of our
[43:11] bethel tabernacle missions
[43:15] to through brother ernie they were
[43:18] trying to finish up their church and so
[43:20] we gave them
[43:21] a nice chunk of cash to try to get it
[43:24] finished
[43:25] they're very very close and so they're
[43:27] very grateful to you as an assembly
[43:28] there's other assemblies that donated as
[43:30] well
[43:31] and i wanted to be a part of that
[43:32] brother samson is a good friend
[43:35] so but he wrote to me and said and you
[43:37] might have seen it in the news
[43:39] there's a second and third wave hitting
[43:41] india and it's overwhelming their
[43:43] health care system thousands are dying
[43:45] daily
[43:46] uh throughout they're even i even seen
[43:48] they're trying to some unrest maybe
[43:51] unseat the prime minister because of it
[43:53] and
[43:54] so brother samson said please pray for
[43:57] him his family's church and
[43:58] all the saints pastors and churches
[44:01] throughout
[44:02] the entire country how many will do that
[44:04] this morning
[44:06] amen all right second timothy chapter
[44:09] four
[44:11] verses seven and eight
[44:16] paul says in verse seven i have fought a
[44:19] good fight
[44:20] i have finished my course i have kept
[44:23] the faith boy that's three big check
[44:25] check marks isn't it i'd like to check
[44:27] all three of those boxes amen
[44:29] amen i have fought a good fight i have
[44:32] finished my course
[44:34] i have kept the faith henceforth there
[44:37] is laid up for me
[44:39] a crown of righteousness so it paid off
[44:43] fighting pays finishing your course
[44:46] pays all right keeping the
[44:50] faith pays henceforth there is laid up
[44:53] for me
[44:55] a crown of righteousness which the lord
[44:58] the righteous judge
[44:59] shall give me at that day and not to
[45:03] and not to me only but unto
[45:06] all unto them also
[45:09] that love his appearing
[45:13] i you know i i think today that
[45:16] one of the things that i can declare in
[45:20] perfect faith
[45:21] because perfect faith's a revelation
[45:23] that's not human faith
[45:24] you need human faith remember just the
[45:27] right mental human mental attitude
[45:29] toward aiding promise of god to bring it
[45:30] to pass
[45:32] now if human faith can accomplish that
[45:33] how much greater is god's perfect
[45:35] revelation of faith
[45:37] and you know i i am a christian by
[45:40] perfect faith
[45:42] perfect faith's not something we're
[45:43] waiting on you if you're born again
[45:44] you've already exercised
[45:46] it because you've passed from death to
[45:47] life and that was a revelation of jesus
[45:50] christ personally to you
[45:52] amen so you want to have
[45:56] um a perfect revelation and i have
[45:59] a perfect revelation and here's
[46:00] something else that i have a perfect
[46:02] revelation of
[46:04] when christ appeared in this day i loved
[46:06] it and i love it
[46:07] and i will keep on loving it i can't not
[46:10] love it it's
[46:11] part of me it's impossible to not
[46:14] love it i i often loathe me
[46:19] and sometimes you get under my skin but
[46:21] i love his appearing
[46:23] amen and it's my hope it's my belief
[46:27] that because of his appearing
[46:29] then i'll be okay and you'll be okay
[46:31] amen
[46:32] we're gonna be okay friends amen we're
[46:34] gonna get a victory
[46:36] and so today i want to speak on a
[46:40] true love for god
[46:43] i had to do something today i don't
[46:44] think i ever remember doing
[46:46] from the back office i was listening to
[46:48] the sunday school class and i had to
[46:50] intentionally cut it off
[46:52] because brother matt was starting to say
[46:53] some things that were getting a little
[46:55] too close to my
[46:56] material and i didn't i didn't want to
[46:58] so i just cut it off
[47:00] amen so amen i want i want you know this
[47:04] just shows me the mind of god working in
[47:07] perfect continuity
[47:09] in his word so let's pray
[47:12] and let's remember our needs here this
[47:14] morning master
[47:16] we thank you for the reading of your
[47:18] word lord there's a great blessing in
[47:20] reading your word there's a great
[47:22] blessing in even hearing it read
[47:24] father we've even lord i i've challenged
[47:28] the the youth group to join me in a
[47:30] bible reading club and many of them
[47:32] lord eagerly and enthusiastically have
[47:35] signed on and are ready now
[47:37] to take their mornings and evenings and
[47:39] spend that quiet hour
[47:41] one in the morning and one in the
[47:43] evening pull away from some of their
[47:45] uh other extraneous
[47:48] stuff just stuff that occupies us
[47:51] technology
[47:52] and stuff and they've decided i'm going
[47:54] to pull away and i'm going to find a
[47:56] quiet place for an hour in the morning
[47:58] and an hour in the evening and i'm just
[48:00] going to read my bible
[48:01] not trying to memorize it not trying to
[48:03] study it i'm just
[48:05] gonna read it father what a glorious
[48:08] crop you can grow from that kind of seed
[48:10] being planted
[48:12] in their hearts master how silly it
[48:15] would be
[48:16] for a farmer to expect a crop when he
[48:19] never planted any seed
[48:21] and yet people all the time they want
[48:23] the peace of god
[48:25] they want that peace that passes
[48:26] understanding they want to have faith
[48:28] for healing they want to have blessings
[48:30] on their finances they want to have this
[48:32] they want to have that they want this
[48:33] that and the other and
[48:35] and they want a crop and they've never
[48:37] sowed seed
[48:39] they've never planted any seed so lord
[48:41] if we want those
[48:43] characteristic attributes of god to
[48:46] if we want us to live under those
[48:48] benefits
[48:49] of of every redemptive blessing under
[48:52] those seven compound redemptive names
[48:54] if we want that active in our lives then
[48:57] we've got to sow the seed of the word in
[48:58] our heart
[48:59] then that grows the crop and it's nature
[49:02] it's not even something we have to force
[49:03] it to happen it just works that way
[49:06] so lord i appreciate their their
[49:08] enthusiasm and their zeal
[49:10] and many have even told me they haven't
[49:13] even yet got signed up but they're
[49:14] planning to do that and
[49:16] so even some of the even some of the
[49:18] adults lord and i just appreciate that
[49:20] we're in treacherous times
[49:22] and we need the love of god shining in
[49:24] our hearts
[49:25] we need to have that peace that passes
[49:28] all understanding
[49:29] flowing through us i pray lord that
[49:32] there will be a blessing upon reading
[49:34] your word as you promised and upon
[49:36] hearing your word
[49:37] and lord we we are asking prayer
[49:40] continued
[49:41] where we want to make a declaration that
[49:43] we are still standing by the promise for
[49:45] our brother joe
[49:46] lord we're adding these needs that
[49:48] sister chastity has put in this morning
[49:51] we're thinking of the brothers and
[49:53] sisters in india
[49:54] lord we're remembering our sister amber
[49:57] and the family there
[49:58] father we're standing on the promises of
[50:01] god
[50:01] to believe that every promise is yea and
[50:04] amen
[50:05] and can be appropriated with per with
[50:07] faith
[50:08] in the word of god nothing wavering
[50:10] master we commit now
[50:12] this service into your hand you see
[50:15] there's much on my mind in my heart
[50:17] but i i want to uh if you want to set
[50:21] any everything aside and just let me
[50:23] preach the main kernel
[50:24] that's perfectly fine with me lord i
[50:26] don't make these decisions that's up to
[50:28] you
[50:29] so i just commit myself to you
[50:30] surrendering get out of the way
[50:32] put all my life under the blood lord as
[50:35] far as i know i'm certainly no secret
[50:36] sinner and as far as i know
[50:38] my whole life is under your blood and if
[50:40] if there's anybody in here today that
[50:42] would have a hindrance in their life may
[50:44] they quickly
[50:45] commit it to the to the cleansing power
[50:48] in the blood of the lamb
[50:49] grant it lord we wouldn't want anything
[50:51] to hinder your word it's too vital
[50:54] it's too needed the the age is too
[50:56] treacherous
[50:57] the time is too perilous lord and we we
[51:00] dare not
[51:01] uh miss a movement of the holy spirit
[51:04] so i pray that your great blessing will
[51:06] be upon it today these are your
[51:08] people feed them lord as you so
[51:10] faithfully always do we commit it to you
[51:12] in jesus name
[51:14] amen god bless you as you're seated
[51:34] all right now i want you to turn with me
[51:37] if you will
[51:38] also this morning while you're seated to
[51:40] the fifth chapter of the book of
[51:42] revelation
[51:43] and re the book of revelation especially
[51:47] this
[51:48] uh this fifth chapter um and as you know
[51:52] as we've taught you many times you
[51:54] i realized that translators hundreds of
[51:56] years later
[51:57] separated the fourth and fifth chapter
[51:59] but they're actually
[52:02] they were a single event uh
[52:05] that john is recording and that becomes
[52:08] apparent
[52:09] when you read four verses one and two
[52:11] and then just jump down to five and read
[52:14] verse one and you'll see that it's just
[52:16] all
[52:17] one single event now i want to
[52:20] make this case we're going to catch uh
[52:22] revelation 5 1 and 2
[52:24] for the brother matt and i i want you to
[52:28] to think about this for a moment let me
[52:30] make this statement
[52:32] so this sequence of events
[52:35] particularly here in chapter 5 and by
[52:38] extension chapter 4
[52:40] and brother branham talks about and
[52:42] calls this time
[52:45] a setting of judgment now
[52:48] you have to be careful and not
[52:51] read well this is pr this is
[52:53] particularly true of the whole book of
[52:54] revelation
[52:55] but you got to really be careful in this
[52:57] fifth chapter to not
[52:59] lay the events out linearly as in the
[53:02] order that you read them
[53:04] because if you do that then then you're
[53:07] going to fall into the trap
[53:09] that some have fallen into saying well
[53:12] now that the seals are open which come
[53:13] in
[53:14] chapter 6 and 7 and then chapter 8 for
[53:17] the seventh seal
[53:18] you're going to say well it's obvious
[53:20] that mercy's over
[53:22] when the seals were opened you know 50
[53:24] plus years ago
[53:25] but but you'd be wrong that's not
[53:29] that's not true see and so so
[53:32] you you have to place it correctly just
[53:35] as brother branham
[53:37] placed it so correctly i i so
[53:39] appreciated
[53:40] a statement brother jd made yesterday we
[53:43] were talking about
[53:44] you know the how that that god has
[53:47] established
[53:49] things you know in the word of god for
[53:50] our daily lives and
[53:52] you know people can sometimes argue over
[53:56] the most silly things
[53:58] and brother jd was telling me you know
[54:00] here some preachers
[54:01] i think abroad and overseas are trying
[54:03] to argue to say
[54:04] you know this whole idea about a woman
[54:07] not cutting her hair and there are
[54:09] you know they're just and you got some
[54:10] preachers saying man let's move on to
[54:12] perfection that's already
[54:14] that's already settled law that's
[54:16] already judicially noticed by god
[54:18] as established law that's what that's
[54:20] what i was telling
[54:22] you know my daughter my daughter my
[54:24] granddaughter and i were having a
[54:25] wonderful discussion on that and i said
[54:27] you know
[54:28] it's interesting honey people who
[54:32] women who who say oh i've left the
[54:34] message now
[54:35] uh i'm not under william branham's
[54:37] bondage i can cut my hair now which is
[54:39] what they all do they cut their hair and
[54:40] put on britches
[54:41] and i said you know sweetie isn't it
[54:43] amazing
[54:44] that that that that neither one of those
[54:47] are william branham doctrine
[54:50] they're not going to have to face
[54:51] william branham at the judgment bar
[54:54] the woman not putting on a garment that
[54:55] pertains to a man is a moses doctrine
[54:58] and and a woman not cutting her hair is
[55:00] a paul st paul doctrine
[55:03] and it's already established law and
[55:05] paul said as also saith the law so
[55:07] so you know the these things are not to
[55:09] be uh argued over it's already
[55:12] established it's already set let's move
[55:14] on to perfection
[55:16] don't argue with the word don't don't
[55:19] strain you know people uh you know they
[55:22] they they strain at a gnat and swallow a
[55:24] camel
[55:25] it's it's you know the devil will just
[55:28] run you
[55:28] in circles doing that you know
[55:31] holiness and and sanctified lives is as
[55:34] well established we're not here to
[55:36] debate it if people don't want to live
[55:38] it then
[55:39] fine see how that works out for you and
[55:42] so
[55:43] you know good luck with that is all i
[55:44] can say so
[55:46] at the day of judgment i mean what are
[55:48] they going to say to paul
[55:50] oh i didn't believe it because william
[55:51] branham taught it paul's going to say
[55:53] excuse me i authored those words
[55:57] william branham was a restoration
[55:59] prophet that simply brought you back to
[56:00] my teaching amen
[56:02] aren't you glad there's no more
[56:04] guesswork
[56:06] amen it's got judicial notice everything
[56:09] in the word of god has been
[56:10] judicial notice is when you know when
[56:12] the when the legislature passes a law
[56:15] and a governor or president signs it in
[56:16] but then the courts have to interpret it
[56:18] and once the courts have have made that
[56:21] interpretation that then that's judicial
[56:23] notice that means you can't argue it
[56:25] anymore
[56:25] it's already been settled in the courts
[56:28] and so
[56:29] so we find that that god
[56:32] you know comes here and in the book of
[56:35] revelation chapter 5
[56:37] and he says i saw in the right hand of
[56:40] him that sat on the throne a book
[56:41] written within and on the backside
[56:43] sealed with seven seals
[56:45] and of course brother branham is going
[56:48] to give this book a title
[56:50] and he's going to call it a book of
[56:52] redemption
[56:53] see the book of redemption and i saw a
[56:55] strong angel
[56:56] proclaiming with a loud voice this is
[56:59] not the mighty angel of revelation 10
[57:01] that's christ this is a strong angel
[57:03] standing with john that john later three
[57:06] different times tried to worship
[57:08] and three different times he said hey
[57:10] don't do that
[57:11] i'm just a mortal prophet i'm not i'm
[57:14] not that kind of angel
[57:16] i'm not a heavenly creature i'm an
[57:18] earthly man like you
[57:20] i'm of your brethren just call me
[57:22] brother
[57:23] you know don't try to make more out of
[57:25] me than then
[57:26] god god has already made my life plenty
[57:29] i don't need
[57:30] you to make any more of it john and so
[57:33] so this strong angel
[57:34] is proclaiming with a loud voice who is
[57:36] worthy to open the book
[57:38] and to loose the seals thereof now
[57:42] you know i i want you to think about my
[57:44] title
[57:45] about what is a a true
[57:48] love for god because we read
[57:52] paul's saying that that there's a crown
[57:55] of righteousness laid up for me now
[57:58] you could stand here all day long and be
[58:00] happy for paul but
[58:01] that wouldn't do you any good except he
[58:04] closed it out by saying
[58:06] oh by the way not just me
[58:09] but all of you who like me love his
[58:12] appearing
[58:14] so i'm in you're in
[58:17] aren't you happy to be in and so
[58:20] so we realized then that you know the
[58:24] the the brother branham would have a lot
[58:26] to say about this fifth chapter and i
[58:28] don't want to get bogged down into a
[58:29] bible study this morning
[58:30] but i i just want to make a few points
[58:32] as we move along
[58:34] so you you're gonna come in fact is
[58:37] we're so we're gonna talk about today
[58:39] you know about this
[58:41] true love of god because
[58:44] i you know i i've i've you've had so
[58:47] many people
[58:48] misunderstand first of all they
[58:51] misunderstand
[58:53] god's love
[58:56] and they also consequently misunderstand
[59:00] their own love for him
[59:04] and so i i've had people in my life
[59:08] stand there i remember on a job site one
[59:11] time and
[59:11] and the superintendent you know and he's
[59:14] part of some denominational church great
[59:16] big mega church
[59:17] and we're just standing there talking
[59:18] about the gospel and i mean
[59:21] i it was he was turning the air blue
[59:24] with language
[59:25] it was horrifying now even today it
[59:28] almost be common street language
[59:30] language but back in the
[59:31] in the late 80s like that it was
[59:33] terrible i couldn't believe
[59:35] the the guttural mouth that he had
[59:38] and then you know and then we start
[59:40] talking about the lord and about
[59:41] salvation about the end of the world
[59:43] and he just says oh i know i'm saved
[59:47] i was like okay
[59:51] okay i'm not sure i know but i'm glad
[59:54] you feel like you know
[59:56] and so you know i i and so i just said
[59:58] well
[59:59] you know it really has very little to do
[1:00:02] with feelings i said
[1:00:04] it's easy to identify you know
[1:00:07] what you believe a lot of times what you
[1:00:10] think
[1:00:11] as you know there is a way that seemeth
[1:00:13] right to a man and
[1:00:14] it ends up being death so really there
[1:00:16] needs to be some kind of an evidence if
[1:00:18] you say i'm a christian
[1:00:19] and brother branham i love his homespun
[1:00:21] way my goodness
[1:00:23] i love brother branham for that reason
[1:00:24] because he just he just uses nature and
[1:00:27] the simple things and keeps you in
[1:00:29] sometimes in ankle deep water he'd take
[1:00:31] those theologians
[1:00:32] who would love to get him out in deep
[1:00:34] water and use greek words and hebrew
[1:00:36] words on him and
[1:00:37] you know he'd have to have jack with him
[1:00:39] and kick him under the table and all
[1:00:40] that kind of stuff
[1:00:41] but brother branham would just stay
[1:00:42] around in the shallows he'd get around
[1:00:44] those doctors of divinity i need to
[1:00:45] start talking about nature
[1:00:47] start talking about a cow eating grass
[1:00:48] or fish you know said
[1:00:50] you know if they're not eating the fish
[1:00:52] won't be eating and he
[1:00:53] you know he starts talking about god and
[1:00:55] starts talking about an apple tree and
[1:00:57] how the sap goes down and you know what
[1:00:59] happens you
[1:01:00] you want to argue with it but you can't
[1:01:02] because you know what he's saying is
[1:01:03] true
[1:01:04] you'd be a to deny it nature all
[1:01:07] nature does indeed run in continuity
[1:01:10] and so you know brother branham would
[1:01:12] just would just have this
[1:01:14] homespun way of saying you know if i say
[1:01:17] i'm a christian then i'll have the life
[1:01:19] of christ
[1:01:20] if i said i had the life of of john
[1:01:22] dillinger wouldn't i carry guns and rob
[1:01:24] banks
[1:01:25] if i said i had the life of harry
[1:01:27] houdini and me wouldn't i be an escape
[1:01:29] artist and a magician and
[1:01:30] a performer well and yes oh yeah that's
[1:01:33] right you would that makes sense
[1:01:35] gee oh well if i say i have the spirit
[1:01:38] of christ
[1:01:41] won't i finish it for me
[1:01:44] you know won't i have that life of
[1:01:47] christ
[1:01:48] and and then you know and so you just
[1:01:50] try to very gently you know
[1:01:52] point that out and people you just then
[1:01:54] you get the deer in the headlights or
[1:01:55] they don't want to talk anymore or
[1:01:56] sometimes
[1:01:57] they go you know that's right tell me
[1:01:59] more and so you never know so you just
[1:02:01] you just scatter the seed
[1:02:03] and you just always be ready to give an
[1:02:05] account you don't have to be a deep
[1:02:06] theologian and
[1:02:08] just stay around in the simple love of
[1:02:10] god and try to get
[1:02:11] people to understand what the what it
[1:02:14] really means to love god amen
[1:02:18] i've had people say you know i i don't
[1:02:20] know about all these
[1:02:22] mysteries and seals i just love jesus
[1:02:24] and i just always say well
[1:02:26] which one well there is only one not
[1:02:29] according to paul
[1:02:30] paul said my fear is that you'll fall
[1:02:33] for another jesus
[1:02:34] who i haven't preached he'll be
[1:02:36] different than the one i'm preaching
[1:02:38] but he'll claim to be the same guy and
[1:02:40] you'll fall for it
[1:02:41] and it's just man-made organization and
[1:02:43] theory but it's not the living word that
[1:02:45] i'm preaching
[1:02:46] and and this is this was paul's fear and
[1:02:49] it's a valid fear
[1:02:50] because as you see today the
[1:02:52] overwhelming
[1:02:54] overwhelming staggeringly overwhelming
[1:02:57] majority of christianity in the world
[1:03:00] today
[1:03:01] is in love with the wrong one
[1:03:04] and they say i love jesus but they
[1:03:06] actually don't love this
[1:03:08] because this begins to tell them about
[1:03:10] their life and that's where they
[1:03:12] that's a full stop they don't want to
[1:03:14] have those things
[1:03:16] they don't want anybody messing with
[1:03:17] their life i'm here to tell you
[1:03:19] something friend
[1:03:20] when i got a revelation of jesus christ
[1:03:23] personally to me
[1:03:25] the first thing i realized is i didn't
[1:03:27] want to be me anymore
[1:03:28] i wanted to be him i mean if you say
[1:03:32] i've had a revelation of jesus christ
[1:03:34] personally and you still want to stay
[1:03:35] you
[1:03:36] no you ain't had a revelation of the
[1:03:39] person i've had
[1:03:40] because when i saw who he was i realized
[1:03:43] how bad and foul i was i said lord
[1:03:45] i don't want to be me i want to be you
[1:03:49] see and that's a real sign
[1:03:52] of real revelation so
[1:03:56] so we find out that you know brother
[1:03:58] branham's standing here when when
[1:03:59] brother branham was in the breach and
[1:04:01] i'm not going to read it i have some
[1:04:02] quotes here before me but trying to save
[1:04:04] some time
[1:04:05] and i'm coming to something so just
[1:04:07] please bear with me i some of what i'm
[1:04:09] saying is rudimentary and elementary to
[1:04:11] you but please just bear with me
[1:04:13] because i want to get to get to where my
[1:04:15] heart is
[1:04:16] so i just want to build you along the
[1:04:18] way as we go and make points as the lord
[1:04:20] leads me
[1:04:21] so we find then that that that as we
[1:04:25] come
[1:04:25] forward brother branham when he's
[1:04:28] reading
[1:04:29] the very passage that you just read with
[1:04:31] me
[1:04:33] that brother branham suddenly something
[1:04:35] comes over him
[1:04:37] and he begins to identify himself with
[1:04:40] that strong angel
[1:04:42] indirectly you see and he says
[1:04:46] oh maybe i'm just feeling it this way
[1:04:49] but then he cries out
[1:04:50] let him come see because that was an
[1:04:54] anointing
[1:04:55] on brother branham now and brother
[1:04:57] branham would say and then brother
[1:04:58] branham watch this brother brandon would
[1:04:59] even go on to say
[1:05:01] let him now come or forever
[1:05:04] hold his peace what
[1:05:08] where where huh
[1:05:12] oh it must be in the old testament no
[1:05:16] you understand now watch watch now
[1:05:19] that's not
[1:05:19] that's not different than if you go to
[1:05:22] zechariah and you look at chapters 3 and
[1:05:24] 4
[1:05:24] and you find you remember i've preached
[1:05:26] on it where
[1:05:28] the high priest joshua the high priest
[1:05:30] is standing there
[1:05:31] and he's representing all of israel all
[1:05:34] of god's elected family because the high
[1:05:35] priest there's no need to have everybody
[1:05:36] there only the high priest would be
[1:05:38] necessary
[1:05:38] the high priest is on trial the devil is
[1:05:41] suing
[1:05:42] the devil is suing in god's court the
[1:05:45] enemy's standing there to resist the
[1:05:46] whole
[1:05:47] the whole thing is that israel is god's
[1:05:49] chosen people and the devil is suing and
[1:05:51] saying no
[1:05:52] no no let me tell you something the way
[1:05:55] they act
[1:05:56] there's no way they can be your people
[1:05:57] because what i see here is not what i
[1:05:59] see in your word lord
[1:06:00] and there's no way that you can let them
[1:06:02] be your people and you
[1:06:04] remember the story that god and that was
[1:06:06] true he had the video evidence he had
[1:06:08] dna
[1:06:08] he had everything forensics to prove
[1:06:11] that israel was indeed guilty of all
[1:06:12] that and god
[1:06:14] dismissed from his throne seated as in
[1:06:16] the book of daniel
[1:06:18] dismiss the charge based on one simple
[1:06:21] thing election amen and he rebukes the
[1:06:25] charges and rebukes the devil
[1:06:27] and says is not who do you think you're
[1:06:29] accusing here
[1:06:31] this is my people whom i have chosen
[1:06:34] you got there is don't you know satan
[1:06:37] there is now
[1:06:38] therefore no condemnation possible
[1:06:41] to them which are in christ they've
[1:06:43] passed from death into life they came
[1:06:45] out of me
[1:06:46] they're a part of me they're coming back
[1:06:47] to me and no mistake they make it no
[1:06:50] accusation you have will ever change
[1:06:52] that
[1:06:53] amen because they're a product of my
[1:06:57] love
[1:06:57] and they love me by a revelation
[1:07:01] they can't even fully explain to you
[1:07:04] they can't even fully explain all the
[1:07:05] time to themselves
[1:07:07] why they just keep holding on sometimes
[1:07:10] they get so discouraged and i watch them
[1:07:12] from my throne and they get so
[1:07:13] discouraged they fail
[1:07:15] they stumble they're almost ready to
[1:07:17] walk away and i just say to an angel run
[1:07:19] down there and drop them a little
[1:07:20] handful of purpose and encourage them
[1:07:22] and let them know to keep pressing keep
[1:07:24] pressing i'm gonna get them i'm gonna
[1:07:26] fix it don't worry
[1:07:28] hallelujah he's got this whole thing
[1:07:29] under his control
[1:07:31] there's there's no weapon formed against
[1:07:33] you that can prosper
[1:07:36] hope in the lord see
[1:07:39] amen i shall yet worship him in his
[1:07:41] tabernacle
[1:07:42] the devil can't stop that he ain't
[1:07:44] nobody
[1:07:46] i tell him all the time satan you ain't
[1:07:48] nobody
[1:07:49] you don't run nothing but your mouth
[1:07:51] you're in control of me i don't live my
[1:07:53] i'm not living but by your mercy i live
[1:07:55] by the mercies of christ
[1:07:57] if the lord allows you to put me in a
[1:08:00] trial then blessed be the name of the
[1:08:01] lord
[1:08:03] i'm not going to give the devil credit
[1:08:05] or credence or not signing a treaty with
[1:08:07] him i don't need a deal
[1:08:08] forget it get away i want nothing to do
[1:08:10] with you satan
[1:08:13] and so we find out that that brother now
[1:08:16] and then and then what happens to
[1:08:17] zechariah zechariah is watching that and
[1:08:19] you know what happened he got excited
[1:08:20] like you did
[1:08:22] when he saw that god dismissed all that
[1:08:24] charge and literally
[1:08:25] brought he said and the lord said bring
[1:08:27] forth clean garments and take these
[1:08:29] filthy garments
[1:08:30] in other words everything that's wrong
[1:08:32] in his life take it off
[1:08:33] and put on clean garments of mine of
[1:08:35] purity and when he done that then
[1:08:38] brother branham
[1:08:39] then then zechariah started jumping them
[1:08:41] down off from the side watching it take
[1:08:43] place writing it down
[1:08:44] and zechariah just like brother branham
[1:08:46] let him now come or
[1:08:49] forever hold his peace why did i say
[1:08:52] that zechariah did the same thing
[1:08:54] like put a fair miter on his head
[1:08:58] everybody's like do what uh
[1:09:02] put a fair miter on his head
[1:09:05] did i say that out loud
[1:09:08] and and the lord says the prophet spoke
[1:09:11] it
[1:09:11] let's do it and the next thing you know
[1:09:13] they bring a miter and set it on his
[1:09:15] head why because that's why brother
[1:09:16] brandon would say i don't call you
[1:09:18] church anymore
[1:09:19] i call you bright because you've been
[1:09:21] you've been anointed you've been
[1:09:23] positionally placed you've got a a a
[1:09:27] robe of cleanness and a crown of
[1:09:29] authority
[1:09:30] to speak the word
[1:09:33] don't let a devil hinder you
[1:09:36] don't give him quarter don't don't do
[1:09:38] anything wipe him out
[1:09:41] you say well you know he he's bigger
[1:09:44] than me
[1:09:44] look it's never had anything to do with
[1:09:46] the size of the dog
[1:09:48] in the fight it's the amount of fight in
[1:09:50] the dog
[1:09:52] i've seen i've seen house cats run big
[1:09:54] dogs down the street
[1:09:56] why because that cat was protecting a
[1:09:59] little toddler here comes a
[1:10:00] a dog looked like a pit bull after the
[1:10:02] little toddler and the cat
[1:10:04] attacked him and the dog ran
[1:10:09] oh tell you something friends don't fear
[1:10:11] the devil take
[1:10:12] faith take courage do like david brother
[1:10:15] branham said when david went after that
[1:10:16] lion and that bear
[1:10:17] he knew he couldn't he's a little skinny
[1:10:20] boy he's only got a slingshot he's only
[1:10:22] got a slingshot
[1:10:23] see but brother but brother brahm said
[1:10:25] david just prayed and said now lord
[1:10:27] my dad put me here to watch these sheep
[1:10:30] and that
[1:10:30] bear took one i'm going after it you
[1:10:32] better help me
[1:10:34] and and away he went and he went after
[1:10:36] the lion and when the lion turned he
[1:10:37] tore him to pieces
[1:10:40] i'll tell you something friends there
[1:10:42] there's there there is
[1:10:43] no nothing can hinder a man or a woman
[1:10:47] who will have faith in god's word
[1:10:49] and go forward confessing all things
[1:10:51] that all things are possible to them
[1:10:54] that believe
[1:10:56] this is what this is what the opening of
[1:10:59] the seals restored back to us
[1:11:01] the whole thing was not to make you a
[1:11:04] mystery
[1:11:05] not to make me a mystery preacher are
[1:11:07] you a mystery believer
[1:11:09] you know some dark it's not even a
[1:11:10] mystery once you're brought into it and
[1:11:12] then you see it it's not a mystery to
[1:11:13] you anymore
[1:11:14] but but it's only a mystery when you're
[1:11:16] on the outside looking in it looks
[1:11:17] mysterious looks cultish but it's not
[1:11:19] once you come in
[1:11:20] once you come in you realize it's the
[1:11:22] light of the shekinah glory
[1:11:24] shining all around you you realize that
[1:11:26] every devil is subject to you at that
[1:11:28] point
[1:11:29] see and and and you're you need that
[1:11:31] that god
[1:11:32] opened these seals because he knew
[1:11:35] that in this day and hour that you live
[1:11:38] in you're gonna need
[1:11:40] what's in those seals to be unlocked
[1:11:43] you're gonna face an
[1:11:44] age that is unprecedented and
[1:11:46] unparalleled
[1:11:47] you're gonna face the dual convergence
[1:11:49] of the days of noah
[1:11:51] and the days of lot simultaneously as
[1:11:54] brother
[1:11:54] diggs was preaching you're under a
[1:11:56] simultaneous two-front attack
[1:11:58] you're totally surrounded i remember i
[1:12:01] think he was the
[1:12:02] the guy who invented the rangers and
[1:12:06] i'm pretty sure our special force i
[1:12:07] can't remember he's one of the early
[1:12:09] guys
[1:12:10] and they and they they in a battle one
[1:12:12] time they said to him
[1:12:14] said chief said we're completely
[1:12:16] surrounded
[1:12:17] and he said good he said they won't get
[1:12:20] away from us this time
[1:12:24] just shoot any direction boys you hit
[1:12:25] somebody
[1:12:27] and so you know he he relished the idea
[1:12:30] of being surrounded now we got him right
[1:12:32] where we want them
[1:12:33] what yeah they won't get away now
[1:12:37] and so so so we find that god knew
[1:12:41] the hour that you would face you would
[1:12:43] need a complete restoration of the word
[1:12:46] of god
[1:12:47] amen you'd need to know how to walk in
[1:12:50] an
[1:12:50] age of complete darkness
[1:12:54] and a gross darkness on the people and
[1:12:57] such a blending of
[1:12:58] of light and darkness where it's
[1:13:00] simultaneously the darkest day ever and
[1:13:03] simultaneously the brightest time
[1:13:05] ever for god's family but the command
[1:13:08] was
[1:13:09] arise shine
[1:13:14] thy light is come so the light is above
[1:13:17] you
[1:13:18] you can't stay here living a carnal
[1:13:21] earthbound life and hope to have that
[1:13:24] light to guide you
[1:13:25] you got to come up out of this dark age
[1:13:28] come up into the realms of the holy
[1:13:30] spirit
[1:13:31] and then you'll see clearly if you don't
[1:13:33] have that friend you're finished
[1:13:35] you're finished you'll you'll never find
[1:13:37] your way through this groping darkness
[1:13:40] and that's why the world uh as the bible
[1:13:42] said loses its ability to the end time
[1:13:44] even to discern right and wrong
[1:13:46] and so you say well how does people come
[1:13:49] up with these laws these days because
[1:13:50] they're in that gross darkness
[1:13:52] say well why do i see that it's wrong
[1:13:54] because you've come into light
[1:13:55] see it's not complicated and so so we
[1:13:59] find that
[1:14:00] you know brother bradham is crying out
[1:14:02] you know let him come now or forever
[1:14:04] hold his peace
[1:14:05] and brother bradham goes on to describe
[1:14:08] what that's all about and he he began to
[1:14:11] he began to say to the people that
[1:14:13] nobody was worthy even to look at the
[1:14:16] book let alone to
[1:14:17] take it and break the seals he says then
[1:14:20] where's your pope and
[1:14:21] where does all these come in and your
[1:14:22] bishops and where's your worthiness
[1:14:24] we're nothing that's right see
[1:14:26] and so so we realized then that that no
[1:14:29] one can do it
[1:14:30] and the angel is calling for a kinsmen
[1:14:33] redeemer to appear
[1:14:35] and so so so we realize that this is a
[1:14:38] an epic moment this is not something to
[1:14:42] to just pass off lightly you know that
[1:14:45] this is why
[1:14:47] you should have a diet in the word of
[1:14:49] god this is why you should come to
[1:14:51] church
[1:14:51] this is why you should have fellowship
[1:14:53] with the saints this is why you
[1:14:55] come to the lord's table sure
[1:14:58] because you're a part of it i i remember
[1:15:02] i i remember our good friend brother
[1:15:04] eugene
[1:15:06] eugene brown in canada and he was
[1:15:08] teaching here the other day
[1:15:10] it's not in my notes but it's noteworthy
[1:15:11] i think i'll just repeat it
[1:15:13] that he was teaching on communion
[1:15:17] and coming to the lord's table
[1:15:21] and he says sometimes parents
[1:15:26] who have completely broken relationships
[1:15:28] with their children
[1:15:30] or their spouse or both
[1:15:35] and he said they come into my office for
[1:15:37] counseling and he said they try to start
[1:15:39] immediately talking about their problem
[1:15:40] he says let's stop
[1:15:42] he says first we gotta we gotta figure
[1:15:44] out where you are
[1:15:45] he says when's the last time you stood
[1:15:48] at the lord's table
[1:15:50] and took the bread and the wine with
[1:15:53] your family and washed the saints feet
[1:15:56] and he says the most peculiar look
[1:15:59] is that he says a father or a mother
[1:16:02] will look at him and go
[1:16:04] what does that have to do with the
[1:16:06] relationship with my children
[1:16:09] and he says it has everything to do with
[1:16:12] it
[1:16:12] he says if your relationship if you're
[1:16:15] never there
[1:16:17] at the lord's table and your
[1:16:19] relationship with god is that messed up
[1:16:22] and then you question why your
[1:16:24] relationship with your kids are messed
[1:16:25] up
[1:16:27] really you wonder why your relationship
[1:16:30] with your wife and children is messed up
[1:16:33] and you got that kind of a messed up
[1:16:35] relationship with god and you wonder why
[1:16:37] i'm asking the question
[1:16:39] amen see you wouldn't you might wouldn't
[1:16:42] think about that but that's
[1:16:44] and when he said i thought my goodness
[1:16:46] that is perfectly according to the
[1:16:47] scriptures
[1:16:48] this is what jesus had this is what adam
[1:16:51] lost
[1:16:53] was that relationship that fellowship
[1:16:55] with god
[1:16:56] and there are people who never come to
[1:16:59] the lord's table
[1:17:02] intentionally wait for it to be
[1:17:04] announced don't come to church why are
[1:17:05] you saying all this please move on i
[1:17:07] can't sorry
[1:17:08] there are people who never come
[1:17:13] i'm trying to lighten you up y'all are
[1:17:14] gonna lock up on me here and put you in
[1:17:16] the vapor lock
[1:17:17] i mean i have to tell you a joke and
[1:17:19] loosen you up a little bit
[1:17:20] there but but it's true there are people
[1:17:22] who never this is not in my notes
[1:17:24] friends
[1:17:25] there are people who never come to the
[1:17:26] lord's table
[1:17:28] never watch the saint there are people
[1:17:29] who never pay tithes
[1:17:33] and brother eugene taught on that and he
[1:17:34] said look at the relationship that
[1:17:36] abraham had with melchizedek
[1:17:38] he paid a tithe 10 of everything he
[1:17:40] owned
[1:17:41] and gave and i remember brother biscuits
[1:17:43] said years ago he said i mean he gave
[1:17:45] him 10
[1:17:45] of his cattle 10 of his camels 10 of his
[1:17:48] sheep 10 of his oxen
[1:17:49] he says i don't even know what happened
[1:17:50] to those 10 of those animals where'd
[1:17:52] they go when
[1:17:52] melchizedek disappeared he'd take him
[1:17:54] home with him i don't know
[1:17:56] we'll find out but but he said that
[1:17:59] that that paying ties was indicative of
[1:18:02] his relationship
[1:18:04] it showed what he thought about his
[1:18:06] friendship with melchizedek
[1:18:09] the lord's table the lord's supper
[1:18:12] shows and then people wonder why they're
[1:18:15] they have these strains in their
[1:18:17] relationship with their friends and
[1:18:19] their spouse and their children
[1:18:21] and and and and they never seem to have
[1:18:23] victory in their life
[1:18:24] friends it's not rocket science
[1:18:28] it's the simple gospel see
[1:18:32] and so you know like we were saying
[1:18:34] earlier when we first started here
[1:18:36] about people arguing over silly nonsense
[1:18:39] of the word straining at a gnat to
[1:18:40] swallow a camel
[1:18:42] i got to move on please let me move on
[1:18:45] so the prophet now
[1:18:48] brother branham is going to go in and
[1:18:51] spend a lot of time and he's going to
[1:18:53] labor in the word of god
[1:18:55] to show you that the claiming of this
[1:18:58] book
[1:18:59] remember this is not to educate you with
[1:19:01] theology and make you mysterious
[1:19:04] i'm simply telling you why god had to
[1:19:07] people who don't want
[1:19:08] the seals they don't want a prophet they
[1:19:09] don't want a message then you have
[1:19:11] no chance because the
[1:19:14] god sent this message and opened these
[1:19:17] seals
[1:19:18] to do what restore back to the church
[1:19:22] everything that adam lost everything
[1:19:24] adam lost is restored
[1:19:26] in christ you say but that happened at
[1:19:29] calvary that's
[1:19:30] true and it went into the church and
[1:19:32] they had the jubilee
[1:19:33] and they had the abstract and they wrote
[1:19:35] a book of acts but then that church
[1:19:37] backslid fell away the disciples died
[1:19:39] off and they went into the dark ages
[1:19:41] and how we finally arrive
[1:19:44] at a church in the last day
[1:19:47] that they can't even go in the rapture
[1:19:50] and they can't get any better
[1:19:55] i mean think that through for a minute
[1:19:58] churches
[1:19:59] who preach the name of jesus
[1:20:04] and nobody in those systems can even get
[1:20:07] ready to go in a rapture
[1:20:09] under that amen under that
[1:20:14] in effect now i'm not don't don't
[1:20:16] misunderstand i'm not saying calvary got
[1:20:18] undone
[1:20:18] i'm saying in effect remember jesus said
[1:20:20] by your traditions you made the word of
[1:20:21] god no effect
[1:20:23] in that vein in effect the church of the
[1:20:26] last days back to pre-calvary
[1:20:29] they're back to pre-calvary in effect
[1:20:31] they might as well be
[1:20:32] they can't get they can't go in the
[1:20:34] rapture they can't improve
[1:20:36] see that's why god called a church out
[1:20:40] of a church said
[1:20:41] because they kicked christ out how
[1:20:44] are they going to give you eternal life
[1:20:48] if they kick out the giver of eternal
[1:20:50] life
[1:20:52] say oh we haven't kicked him out they
[1:20:54] they haven't kicked their
[1:20:55] their statues out they haven't kicked
[1:20:57] their crucifix out of their church
[1:20:58] they haven't kicked their stories of
[1:21:00] 2000 years ago but they have
[1:21:02] they have rejected this and put christ
[1:21:05] out
[1:21:05] how are they going to be born again
[1:21:08] therefore my brother my sister the path
[1:21:10] to back to have everything restored that
[1:21:12] adam lost
[1:21:13] and that calvary secured is to come back
[1:21:15] to the word
[1:21:16] so that it can be a bleeding word for
[1:21:18] you
[1:21:19] amen now how important is this message
[1:21:24] to you
[1:21:24] [Music]
[1:21:26] now how important is it see
[1:21:29] you sure you want to trivialize its
[1:21:31] teachings
[1:21:32] you're sure you want to just kind of
[1:21:34] weigh them as a good uh
[1:21:35] just an opinion and and i know brother
[1:21:38] branham said i shouldn't do that or do
[1:21:39] this but
[1:21:40] you know i i don't know i i kind of
[1:21:43] think that's just his opinion
[1:21:44] be careful be careful
[1:21:48] this was a man who spent 50 percent of
[1:21:50] his life in the presence of this
[1:21:51] kind of light tell me last time you did
[1:21:54] that
[1:21:54] come what was that
[1:22:00] so we find then that
[1:22:03] that it's amazing because now watch
[1:22:07] this here's here's an an amazing point
[1:22:11] once you go past revelation
[1:22:15] 5 with a closed book then you come to
[1:22:18] revelation 10
[1:22:19] and now it's an open book and christ has
[1:22:22] stepped out of eternity claim it loose
[1:22:24] the seals broke them off
[1:22:25] himself what is it friends what's the
[1:22:26] opening of the seals the mighty god
[1:22:28] unveiled
[1:22:29] now now i can explain to you who is this
[1:22:31] melchizedek
[1:22:33] see before it was unclear it wasn't even
[1:22:36] clear
[1:22:36] what all that meant you know jesus is
[1:22:38] the son of god and he's one with the one
[1:22:40] with the father and the best we had was
[1:22:42] a oneness ideology
[1:22:44] until the seals are open and now where
[1:22:46] and it's an open door
[1:22:48] started at the end of philadelphia and
[1:22:50] moved into laodicea into the azusa
[1:22:52] revival
[1:22:53] but but it but that was just a very
[1:22:55] narrow view there
[1:22:56] the mighty god had to be unveiled
[1:22:58] because you've got to become like
[1:23:01] him god's not interested in you becoming
[1:23:04] like a denomination they're not going in
[1:23:05] the rapture
[1:23:06] i'm not saying individuals in it can't
[1:23:08] be called out of there to go into
[1:23:09] rapture
[1:23:10] that's still happening but i'm talking
[1:23:12] about god's not rapturing a system
[1:23:16] he's rapturing individuals who have who
[1:23:18] have believed the
[1:23:20] report and have accepted the life of
[1:23:22] christ in their life
[1:23:23] and are living and allowing the word to
[1:23:26] live through them if you're not allowing
[1:23:28] the word to live through you the token
[1:23:29] is not on display
[1:23:31] it doesn't it it negates what you
[1:23:33] believe
[1:23:35] see because in order to go you the token
[1:23:37] has to be on display
[1:23:39] and that's not going to happen if you
[1:23:41] haven't surrendered
[1:23:43] so why don't god just force me he's
[1:23:45] never going to do that
[1:23:47] you've got to surrender the bride hath
[1:23:50] made herself ready
[1:23:52] see so we humble ourselves and so
[1:23:56] we find then after you after you leave
[1:23:59] this area
[1:24:00] then you notice in in chapter 10 now
[1:24:03] it's an open book
[1:24:04] given to the prophet give it to the
[1:24:05] people tell them to eat it
[1:24:07] yeah go and ask for it here it is eat it
[1:24:09] you must prophesy
[1:24:10] see that that ministry the son of man's
[1:24:12] got to continue even after the
[1:24:14] office of the son of man leaves the
[1:24:16] ministry of the son of man was a
[1:24:17] different thing has to continue it's got
[1:24:19] to be restored that's what they had in
[1:24:20] the book of acts that's what we got to
[1:24:21] have in the omega
[1:24:22] the same thing they had in the alpha
[1:24:23] right amen
[1:24:25] so we find that that that book
[1:24:28] you're not going to see that anymore
[1:24:32] you're not going to read about that
[1:24:33] little book anymore because
[1:24:35] why that book has now been consumed and
[1:24:38] assimilated and it's now standing in a
[1:24:40] people
[1:24:43] amen so so all right
[1:24:46] let's think about our bibles for a
[1:24:47] moment
[1:24:49] so here comes here comes the angel of
[1:24:52] the lord
[1:24:54] to mary hail mary they are highly
[1:24:57] favored
[1:24:59] and you're going to bring forth a son
[1:25:00] now what is he doing he's quoting
[1:25:02] prophecy
[1:25:04] and you're going to call his name and
[1:25:06] he's going to be save his people
[1:25:08] he's a manual and you're going to call
[1:25:09] his name jesus and
[1:25:11] and and mary mary says well
[1:25:14] how's this even gonna work i'm i'm a
[1:25:16] virgin i know no man
[1:25:17] but now watch here's the point here's a
[1:25:19] point i want you to get
[1:25:21] what had been declared was already
[1:25:24] written
[1:25:25] you understand it was already in the
[1:25:27] bible god's not being redundant
[1:25:30] when he starts quoting the word already
[1:25:33] written to mary
[1:25:35] he's not just filling up the air with
[1:25:38] words or being redundant or speaking for
[1:25:40] no purpose
[1:25:41] but you have to understand that the
[1:25:43] written word
[1:25:44] is not designed to stay written word
[1:25:48] that written word has got to come into
[1:25:50] flesh and become a manifestation
[1:25:53] and so he's bringing the word to a human
[1:25:56] girl
[1:25:56] who's going to say amen to every word i
[1:25:59] don't know how it'll happen
[1:26:01] but you said it i believe it amen to the
[1:26:04] word of god
[1:26:05] and you know what happened without
[1:26:07] knowing a mortal
[1:26:09] man she conceived a child
[1:26:12] and had a baby
[1:26:15] why because the word became flesh
[1:26:18] amen so that you don't read about the
[1:26:21] book anymore why because the book has
[1:26:22] now been taken the book is now
[1:26:24] assimilated the book is now
[1:26:26] living behind the skin of god's bride in
[1:26:28] the earth
[1:26:30] and she and that's that's why she has
[1:26:32] thus saith the lord
[1:26:34] or she keeps still in other words it's
[1:26:35] the only thing she has to say
[1:26:37] she's not interested anymore in
[1:26:40] propagating man-made theory
[1:26:42] the only time you hear me preaching is
[1:26:44] thus saith the lord
[1:26:46] i'm not preaching baptist theology
[1:26:48] anymore if i don't have thus saith the
[1:26:50] lord to preach i won't preach
[1:26:52] you follow me so she has thus saith the
[1:26:55] lord or she keeps quiet
[1:26:56] see she knows what god wants done
[1:27:00] with his word and so as we unite then
[1:27:03] with this word
[1:27:05] then we are uniting with the lamb uh
[1:27:08] and that's the marriage the marriage
[1:27:10] remember is here
[1:27:12] because you're uniting with the lamb in
[1:27:14] his word and you go
[1:27:15] to the wedding supper amen
[1:27:18] so we find that it's not just becoming
[1:27:20] theologically more astute or more wise
[1:27:23] or whatever it's far more than that
[1:27:24] this is a living word so christ then
[1:27:28] uh that living logos that we are now
[1:27:32] being united to and and and it's and
[1:27:36] it's literally
[1:27:36] uh brother bradham would use a word that
[1:27:39] webster don't even like
[1:27:41] uh you know that that the the the bride
[1:27:44] is now impregnated she's
[1:27:46] she's pregnanted with the word of god
[1:27:49] she has his kentucky language he's
[1:27:51] pregnanted with the word of god what's
[1:27:52] it doing bringing forth the life of the
[1:27:54] son of god
[1:27:55] in her life see and so so you you find
[1:27:59] that
[1:28:00] that the trumpet has sounded you you
[1:28:03] read that
[1:28:04] in revelation 1 revelation 4. there's a
[1:28:06] couple other places throughout
[1:28:08] but you remember that john
[1:28:12] said i heard behind me
[1:28:16] something that sounded like a trumpet
[1:28:19] talking to me
[1:28:22] see and so this is a voice that sounded
[1:28:25] like a trumpet because
[1:28:26] what is coming into the church is the
[1:28:29] jubilee that's the trumpet it's the
[1:28:31] jubilee that's what christ
[1:28:33] his death his burial his resurrection
[1:28:37] his ascension
[1:28:38] sending his life back into the church
[1:28:40] and now the church
[1:28:42] has the jubilee israel waited for and
[1:28:44] rejected
[1:28:45] amen israel rejected it as a nation
[1:28:48] and so then so now the church uh the
[1:28:51] holy ghost filled church now they have
[1:28:53] the abstract they have the jubilee they
[1:28:55] have the title book
[1:28:56] it's all unsealed and opened but the
[1:28:58] bible was never sealed to paul
[1:29:00] you understand it got sealed because the
[1:29:02] church fell away
[1:29:04] and there was no and just like the
[1:29:05] cherubim who chased adam and eve out of
[1:29:07] the garden of eden unless they put forth
[1:29:09] their hand
[1:29:10] to the tree of life and and live forever
[1:29:12] in a fallen condition
[1:29:13] so god has got to seal up the word he
[1:29:16] can't allow that
[1:29:17] that jubilee token any longer it now
[1:29:19] becomes a dip it's proportionate to the
[1:29:21] light they have
[1:29:22] it comes all the way down to the end
[1:29:24] time to do what be open
[1:29:26] back and be restored back to bring a
[1:29:29] people back to the original
[1:29:32] and here we are and we're it you're it
[1:29:36] see and so so we
[1:29:39] find then that we've been united to it
[1:29:42] so you know they they asked jesus about
[1:29:45] the kingdom
[1:29:46] you know when he was on the on the mount
[1:29:48] before he went up he says now
[1:29:50] that's going to come the father has that
[1:29:53] in his plans
[1:29:54] don't worry about it here's what here's
[1:29:57] what you need to worry about
[1:29:58] go until you be endued with power from
[1:30:01] on high and then you're going to become
[1:30:02] a witness to me in jerusalem judea
[1:30:03] samaria another
[1:30:04] part of the earth so what you're going
[1:30:06] to find out is the kingdom is coming we
[1:30:08] are headed for a millennium
[1:30:10] but in the interim between now and then
[1:30:13] the kingdom of god is actually going to
[1:30:15] be in you
[1:30:18] you understand and the and so the
[1:30:20] millennium is just simply a completion
[1:30:22] of this whole process
[1:30:23] that's why the holy ghost is called an
[1:30:25] earnest
[1:30:27] see it's an earnest of your inheritance
[1:30:29] you've got a new body coming how do i
[1:30:31] know because i already got a new soul
[1:30:33] already got a new nature
[1:30:35] and it's going to give me a new body a
[1:30:37] new spirit a new mind it's going to make
[1:30:39] all things new see and so so we find out
[1:30:43] that
[1:30:44] that that the kingdom uh is working
[1:30:46] within us so now
[1:30:48] and we were talking about this uh
[1:30:49] yesterday brother jason and i and
[1:30:50] brother don because
[1:30:52] when you go back jesus in luke 4
[1:30:55] 9 give me 4 9 brother matt
[1:30:59] saint luke chapter 4 verse 9 and you're
[1:31:02] going to find here
[1:31:03] where jesus is going back to quote uh
[1:31:06] the scripture
[1:31:08] uh we'll get in a second here i just
[1:31:09] want to i just want you to stay with me
[1:31:10] and i'm trying to watch my time i
[1:31:12] should be able to finish up here just in
[1:31:14] a minute and he brought him to jerusalem
[1:31:16] and set him on a pinnacle of the temple
[1:31:18] and said unto him
[1:31:20] if thou be the son of god cast thyself
[1:31:24] down from hence all right next
[1:31:26] for it is written he shall give his
[1:31:28] angels charge over thee to keep thee
[1:31:30] carry on
[1:31:31] and in their hands they shall bear thee
[1:31:33] up lest at any time thou dash thy foot
[1:31:35] against the stone
[1:31:36] jesus answering and said in him it is
[1:31:38] said thou shalt not tempt the lord thy
[1:31:40] god
[1:31:40] and when the devil had ended all
[1:31:42] temptation he departed
[1:31:44] from him for a season now all right now
[1:31:47] jesus go back jesus returned and the
[1:31:50] power of the spirit in the galilee and
[1:31:52] there went out of fame
[1:31:53] throughout all the region round about
[1:31:54] all right now so here in luke chapter 4
[1:31:57] i started too late where
[1:31:59] he starts showing him the kingdoms of
[1:32:01] the world
[1:32:03] and he said i'll give you all of these
[1:32:05] kingdoms and brother branham said jesus
[1:32:07] already knew he would come inherit them
[1:32:09] anyway
[1:32:10] so what satan was trying to do was give
[1:32:13] him a shortcut listen
[1:32:15] you don't have to die you don't need to
[1:32:18] suffer
[1:32:19] come on everybody loves you you're young
[1:32:22] you want to live who wants to suffer
[1:32:25] see and so so how about i just give it
[1:32:28] all to you for free
[1:32:31] now that would have been a deal almost
[1:32:33] too hard to pass up
[1:32:35] but jesus knew and if this don't make
[1:32:37] you love him i don't know what else to
[1:32:39] say
[1:32:40] jesus knew that if he took that deal
[1:32:43] you would be born in sin and stay in sin
[1:32:47] forever and at the end of your life with
[1:32:50] no chance about to get out of it
[1:32:52] satan would claim you and and christ
[1:32:56] the bible says that right at the time
[1:32:58] when he was suffering
[1:33:00] the bible says he shall see his seed and
[1:33:02] be satisfied
[1:33:04] here to tell you something friends
[1:33:06] christ rejected that offer in order
[1:33:08] to save you they said to him come down
[1:33:10] off the cross and save yourself but he
[1:33:12] knew
[1:33:13] that if he saved himself he couldn't
[1:33:14] save you and so he
[1:33:16] gave up his life freely
[1:33:20] and was tortured to death for you
[1:33:24] because he knew the grave couldn't hold
[1:33:26] him
[1:33:27] so we find then that that he he comes
[1:33:31] into the temple
[1:33:32] and and he's handed the scroll and he
[1:33:34] reads from the prophet
[1:33:36] that how that his ministry is to preach
[1:33:39] the acceptable year of the lord give me
[1:33:41] 4 19
[1:33:42] uh this time brother matt let's catch
[1:33:44] that 4 9 luke 4 19.
[1:33:48] and i'll go back to 18. uh
[1:33:51] the spirit of the lord is upon me
[1:33:52] they've handed him the scroll because he
[1:33:54] hath anointed me to preach the gospel to
[1:33:56] the poor it
[1:33:56] set me to heal the brokenhearted to
[1:33:58] preach deliverance to the captives
[1:33:59] recovering of sight to the blind
[1:34:01] set at liberty them that are bruised to
[1:34:03] preach
[1:34:04] the acceptable year of the lord so
[1:34:07] you're so you're finding then that that
[1:34:10] jesus
[1:34:11] in his ministry is he's he's referring
[1:34:14] now back
[1:34:15] to the old testament jubilee i've i've
[1:34:18] come to
[1:34:18] take them out of prison i've come to
[1:34:21] heal them i've come to repair them i've
[1:34:22] come to set them at liberty
[1:34:24] and so this was the jubilee now in the
[1:34:26] jubilee if you go back to the book of
[1:34:28] leviticus
[1:34:29] you'll find three things happen first
[1:34:32] there had to be an atonement
[1:34:34] they had to take the bullock or whatever
[1:34:36] animal and they slew the
[1:34:37] and then sprinkle the blood and without
[1:34:39] the shedding of blood there's no
[1:34:41] remission of sins
[1:34:42] right so the blood had to be on the
[1:34:44] mercy seat if it didn't have blood on it
[1:34:47] it's a judgment seat
[1:34:50] you understand why people try to
[1:34:51] approach christ today
[1:34:53] and they only make they only end up
[1:34:56] getting worse
[1:34:57] because they're trying to approach god's
[1:34:59] mercy but they don't have the bleeding
[1:35:02] word
[1:35:03] and it's just a judgment word today
[1:35:07] why why can you have access to christ
[1:35:10] because you you have the blood the blood
[1:35:13] is speaking for you how did i get it
[1:35:15] because you believe the word and the
[1:35:17] word is a living word
[1:35:19] hallelujah it has life in it see a
[1:35:22] denomination
[1:35:23] can't bleed for you only the word can
[1:35:26] bleed for you
[1:35:28] and so so he's so they they had to
[1:35:31] have that atonement they had to put the
[1:35:33] blood on the
[1:35:34] mercy seat then they blew a trumpet
[1:35:38] and the trumpet second thing the trumpet
[1:35:40] was a jubilee trumpet
[1:35:42] and the third thing was every man
[1:35:45] could then go back to his original
[1:35:47] possessions
[1:35:49] he had lost him through debt through bad
[1:35:51] management through this through family
[1:35:52] tragedy through however he lost them
[1:35:54] but and he had to you know become sell
[1:35:57] himself as an indentured servant he had
[1:35:59] to
[1:35:59] mortgage his land and and and but now
[1:36:03] now we find out that there's blood
[1:36:05] atonement then a trumpet sounds
[1:36:07] then a jew then then that's a jubilee
[1:36:09] then every man can return to his
[1:36:11] possessions now
[1:36:11] it's exactly like that at calvary first
[1:36:14] there had to be the sacrifice
[1:36:16] amen and then what what did that do what
[1:36:19] did john hear
[1:36:20] in the revelation of jesus christ the
[1:36:22] very first chapter i heard behind me a
[1:36:23] trumpet
[1:36:24] what is it doing sounding a jubilee now
[1:36:26] what does that mean
[1:36:27] every man in god's family by the baptism
[1:36:30] of the holy ghost
[1:36:31] now he can go back to his possessions
[1:36:34] what possessions
[1:36:35] everything adam lost is now restored
[1:36:39] back to you and i and that
[1:36:43] grants to you the power of the spoken
[1:36:45] word it allows you to
[1:36:47] finally finally be free of yourself
[1:36:50] and live the kind of life god built you
[1:36:53] and ordained you to live
[1:36:56] you're free from the grip of it nobody
[1:36:59] can force you into it anymore
[1:37:02] everything adam lost
[1:37:06] is restored back to the church
[1:37:11] see so this is why
[1:37:15] mysteries are so important
[1:37:18] this is why the opening of the seals
[1:37:20] this is why brother diggs
[1:37:23] was preaching the way he preached
[1:37:24] wednesday night a little bit out of the
[1:37:25] ordinary for a wednesday night a little
[1:37:27] bit out of ordinary for brother cadre
[1:37:29] but he's beginning to show you what do
[1:37:31] you do take you right to the book of
[1:37:32] revelation
[1:37:33] to show you do you realize what has
[1:37:35] happened
[1:37:36] do you realize that you have been set
[1:37:37] apart now for the master
[1:37:40] that you're now an elect lady you're now
[1:37:42] his chosen
[1:37:43] you're you're you're the rapture
[1:37:45] material you're
[1:37:46] all we're doing brother bradham said i'm
[1:37:47] not looking for another revival he said
[1:37:49] i'm only looking for the coming of the
[1:37:51] lord
[1:37:51] what is the bride doing she's been
[1:37:53] laying in the presence of the sun
[1:37:54] we've been trying to find that last seed
[1:37:57] you know
[1:37:58] whether jd is over in the middle east or
[1:38:00] whether brother
[1:38:01] barry is in africa or or whether brother
[1:38:04] ernie's in the pacific islands it
[1:38:06] doesn't matter
[1:38:07] we're trying to find that last seed my
[1:38:09] friends and the bride is growing and
[1:38:11] maturing and growing and maturing and
[1:38:13] finding that last seed
[1:38:14] we're headed home and nothing
[1:38:18] nothing whatever can stop it
[1:38:22] and so many times that
[1:38:25] people they they they just don't see
[1:38:29] the need for it and i just think that's
[1:38:31] sad
[1:38:32] you know if you let me just let me just
[1:38:35] let me just finish up some statements
[1:38:37] here i'll just say it like this
[1:38:41] you know if you
[1:38:45] go to go to matthew 13. and we won't go
[1:38:48] there today but if you go into matthew
[1:38:50] 13
[1:38:50] you'll find all the seven church ages
[1:38:53] laid out perfectly but lonnie taught me
[1:38:54] that years ago
[1:38:56] showed it to me so clearly verse by
[1:38:57] verse and all seven ages are laid out
[1:39:00] right there in matthew 13.
[1:39:01] now it's it's amazing because
[1:39:05] in matthew 13 you remember jesus gives
[1:39:09] all kinds of parables you know
[1:39:11] kingdom of heaven is like an unto the
[1:39:13] kingdom of heaven is likened to a man
[1:39:14] you know so defeat had found a pearl of
[1:39:16] great price sold everything he had
[1:39:18] bought the field the kingdom is like an
[1:39:19] unto
[1:39:20] a seed which though the smallest seed
[1:39:23] remember he said it grew into a great
[1:39:25] tree which the fowls of the air
[1:39:26] remember that mustard seed brother bam
[1:39:28] showed that that was at the end time
[1:39:29] that tree
[1:39:30] the fowls were demons and it grew into
[1:39:33] the beast system
[1:39:35] remember it started out so so just a
[1:39:37] little seed
[1:39:38] and that's the that's the mistake
[1:39:41] sometimes we make
[1:39:42] we look at something and go that's kind
[1:39:45] of small
[1:39:46] that might be but what might it grow
[1:39:48] into
[1:39:49] if you keep feeding on it you see why
[1:39:53] i'm trying to get
[1:39:54] the senior youth to start reading their
[1:39:55] bible what am i doing trying to make
[1:39:57] them smarter no
[1:39:58] i told them don't even try to memorize
[1:39:59] it or study it just read it because what
[1:40:01] am i doing
[1:40:02] it's getting the seed down into their
[1:40:03] heart it's giving god something to come
[1:40:05] along in water
[1:40:07] amen and when god starts to water it'll
[1:40:09] start growing a crop
[1:40:10] isn't that beautiful that's why when
[1:40:13] they asked brother adam how do i
[1:40:14] overcome he said simple read your bible
[1:40:15] and pray
[1:40:17] see there's more power in that than you
[1:40:19] can realize
[1:40:20] and so if you if you and so one of the
[1:40:23] parables jesus tells
[1:40:25] is the parable of the sower remember
[1:40:29] and he says um
[1:40:32] a man had a field sowed seeds
[1:40:35] and while he slept his enemy came
[1:40:37] remember that sowed tares
[1:40:39] and when they came up his servants said
[1:40:41] oh
[1:40:42] lord do you want us to pull him up he
[1:40:44] said no no it's all right it's cool
[1:40:45] let them grow together at the uh our
[1:40:47] harvest we'll separate it all and
[1:40:49] we'll take the we'll gather first thing
[1:40:50] we'll do is gather up the weeds
[1:40:52] and we'll bind them all together see and
[1:40:55] we'll burn them
[1:40:56] and then we'll take the the wheat and
[1:40:58] we'll we'll do what we'll do with that
[1:41:00] and then we'll take it to the barn
[1:41:01] okay perfect plan and and uh
[1:41:05] and the whole all the people round
[1:41:07] around
[1:41:08] they were satisfied with that you know
[1:41:10] you get home from
[1:41:11] church that day you went to hear pastor
[1:41:14] jesus and
[1:41:14] somebody say oh you went to his rival
[1:41:17] yeah i was at his rival what'd he preach
[1:41:18] on oh he preached on farming and
[1:41:20] he's pretty good yeah said some good
[1:41:22] things
[1:41:24] something about you know garner and
[1:41:26] wheat and burning and i don't know
[1:41:28] and there's some enemy that did
[1:41:30] something and the master was pretty
[1:41:31] chill
[1:41:32] about it and so i don't know
[1:41:33] [Laughter]
[1:41:36] but not the disciples when the disciples
[1:41:40] got him in closed doors they said
[1:41:41] lord we know there's more to this gospel
[1:41:45] than
[1:41:46] that we know that this gospel isn't just
[1:41:49] some fuzzy feel good
[1:41:51] love your neighbor pay your taxes we
[1:41:54] know that there's more to the gospel
[1:41:56] than that now tell
[1:41:57] us the meaning behind that parable
[1:42:01] you know what it turns out it turns out
[1:42:04] the field was the world
[1:42:07] it turns out that the good seed were the
[1:42:09] children of the kingdom and the one that
[1:42:11] sowed the tares was the devil
[1:42:15] and it grew a crop of devil-filled
[1:42:18] controlled people
[1:42:20] and it turns out that that little
[1:42:23] harmless gathering i will wait to the
[1:42:25] end
[1:42:26] turns out that was the end of the world
[1:42:30] this wasn't just some farming story he's
[1:42:33] not adding a chapter to the almanac
[1:42:35] this is the end of the world he's
[1:42:37] qualifying what
[1:42:39] everybody's got a question what's life
[1:42:41] all about what's the meaning of life
[1:42:42] here it is in this parable
[1:42:44] from genesis to revelation everything
[1:42:48] that god has ever done and every human
[1:42:50] here's the reason for it the field was
[1:42:52] the world the sower of the good seed was
[1:42:54] son of man but he had an enemy and he
[1:42:56] sowed also
[1:42:57] and don't worry at the end time i'll
[1:43:00] send forth
[1:43:00] and we'll bind up the tares and
[1:43:02] everybody thinks oh that doesn't sound
[1:43:04] very harmful until you realize
[1:43:06] that it's the world council of churches
[1:43:08] and the beast system gathering
[1:43:10] all of the denominations together
[1:43:13] binding them together which has to
[1:43:16] happen before
[1:43:17] the rapture before the grain goes to the
[1:43:19] granary
[1:43:20] before it goes to the garner the binding
[1:43:22] you say what's happening right now
[1:43:24] you're witnessing the binding the whole
[1:43:26] world is being bound
[1:43:27] say are we not caught up in it no why
[1:43:30] because we came out of her my people
[1:43:34] turns out that that that that sending
[1:43:37] the grain
[1:43:38] to the to the barn is the rapture
[1:43:42] and then it turns out whoa then that
[1:43:46] means the burning
[1:43:48] is the tribulation period
[1:43:52] and billions with the b
[1:43:56] will perish in the tribulation
[1:44:01] all the tares that are being bound
[1:44:04] they're being
[1:44:04] bound after the grain is taken in
[1:44:08] they go to the burning amen
[1:44:11] and people say that's that's ominous
[1:44:14] that's horrible
[1:44:16] but you know people always want to say
[1:44:18] god's not fair
[1:44:20] because nobody even has a chance except
[1:44:22] his elected family well that's not true
[1:44:25] that's not true i mean you say well
[1:44:28] nobody can even see it
[1:44:29] except his elected family what depends
[1:44:32] on how you qualify seeing
[1:44:34] there there are there's going to be
[1:44:35] millions of people in heaven that
[1:44:37] weren't in the message
[1:44:39] you understand we're not talking about
[1:44:40] in the royal city that's the bride but
[1:44:42] outside there will be millions of people
[1:44:43] there
[1:44:44] who were saved from destruction they
[1:44:47] weren't born again
[1:44:48] they had to be judged in matthew 25 and
[1:44:50] were granted eternal life
[1:44:51] but but they are safe from destruction
[1:44:54] you say
[1:44:55] because remember friend god gives
[1:44:56] everybody a legit chance
[1:44:58] even people who might not be in his
[1:45:00] elect family get a legit chance he gave
[1:45:02] cain a legit chance king could never get
[1:45:05] abel's revelation but god still offered
[1:45:07] him a way to save his life
[1:45:10] see pharaoh in egypt
[1:45:14] during he wasn't elected like abraham
[1:45:17] abraham was elected but when abraham
[1:45:19] backslid
[1:45:20] and as in and is done in egypt even the
[1:45:23] pharaoh at that time honored god and
[1:45:24] recognized him
[1:45:26] and and gave him back his wife and gave
[1:45:27] him all kinds of gifts and treasures and
[1:45:29] send him packing
[1:45:31] the king of philistia the the philistine
[1:45:33] king
[1:45:34] uh in guerrer recognized when he
[1:45:37] abraham lied to him that's my sister i'm
[1:45:39] gonna take her and marry her when god
[1:45:40] said you're finished if you do because
[1:45:41] that's his wife lord
[1:45:43] this lying prophet of yours told me it
[1:45:44] was his sister said well it's his wife
[1:45:46] and you better give her back or you're
[1:45:48] done
[1:45:49] lord you know i'm a righteous man i know
[1:45:51] you're a righteous man that's why i'm
[1:45:52] saving your life
[1:45:53] see paul said they all saw god just in
[1:45:56] nature i mean if you think about it
[1:45:58] god gave mankind the lowest bar that he
[1:46:01] could possibly give him just
[1:46:03] recognize god in nature just understand
[1:46:06] that
[1:46:07] that a tree drops its apples because
[1:46:09] winter's coming and the sap goes down
[1:46:10] but in the spring it comes back
[1:46:12] understand death burial and resurrection
[1:46:14] and you'll understand a little bit about
[1:46:15] christ
[1:46:17] and instead instead of receiving that
[1:46:20] low bar
[1:46:21] they turn him into reptiles and birds
[1:46:22] and creatures and they worship the
[1:46:24] creator
[1:46:25] my the creation more than the creator
[1:46:26] and paul said he's going to be just in
[1:46:28] destroying them
[1:46:30] because the son went up in the heavens
[1:46:31] every day and declared his glory
[1:46:33] [Music]
[1:46:35] every day they saw it and they denied
[1:46:36] his very existence and and even if they
[1:46:38] did
[1:46:38] accept his existence they deny any
[1:46:40] control over their lives
[1:46:43] you see you see my friends so
[1:46:46] god is not unjust but but that doesn't
[1:46:50] change the fact that god has sent a word
[1:46:52] and god has a family
[1:46:54] and i'm here to tell you something
[1:46:55] you're looking at a man today who is so
[1:46:58] grateful to god
[1:46:59] that when he appeared i loved it
[1:47:03] that's the real love of god
[1:47:07] that when god appeared i loved him
[1:47:12] i loved his word paul says that you were
[1:47:15] created in him
[1:47:16] that you were that those that you were
[1:47:19] predestinated that them that
[1:47:22] it was all those that he loved those are
[1:47:24] the ones that he called and
[1:47:25] ends up justifying it's all about the
[1:47:28] love of god and then
[1:47:30] then you and i i'm closing uh
[1:47:33] how's brother diggs i'm getting ready to
[1:47:35] close
[1:47:37] fit infinite clothes all right i really
[1:47:40] am for real
[1:47:42] and and god says
[1:47:46] now love one another
[1:47:51] with a fervent love think about that
[1:47:55] jesus comes with jesus comes to him with
[1:47:57] a principle about the kingdom
[1:47:59] and he starts talking about we often
[1:48:01] call it the golden rule
[1:48:03] and he says you know however you want to
[1:48:06] be treated
[1:48:08] by people you treat them how you want
[1:48:11] them to treat you
[1:48:12] and he says and then just in this is
[1:48:15] summed up all the law and the prophets
[1:48:18] see so that that's a principle of god
[1:48:21] now in the millennium that's going to be
[1:48:24] restored
[1:48:25] everybody in the millennium will treat
[1:48:28] each other
[1:48:28] like they want to be treated you
[1:48:31] understand
[1:48:32] that because that's what the law and the
[1:48:34] prophets is all about
[1:48:35] and god god has brought us to say
[1:48:39] i don't need you to wait till the
[1:48:41] millennium
[1:48:42] you have access to that kind of love now
[1:48:45] you have access to that kind of faith
[1:48:47] now you have access to this everything
[1:48:50] that adam lost
[1:48:51] you have it now you don't have to wait
[1:48:53] for a body change
[1:48:54] already demons are subject to you
[1:48:57] already you're a king over the flesh the
[1:48:58] devil the world in sin
[1:49:01] already there's no weapon formed against
[1:49:03] you that can prosper jesus would say to
[1:49:05] you today
[1:49:06] why do you doubt why do you fear believe
[1:49:08] god
[1:49:09] all things are possible to them that
[1:49:11] believe
[1:49:13] there is there is nothing that can
[1:49:17] derail
[1:49:18] god's plan of redemption
[1:49:21] in your life because that plan included
[1:49:24] you
[1:49:25] before the foundation of the world
[1:49:28] that same redemptive blessing that same
[1:49:32] position that adam enjoyed that's
[1:49:34] restored to us
[1:49:35] let's stand musicians come on back amen
[1:49:38] brother matt bring your team and come
[1:49:39] back and
[1:49:40] let's sing a song or two before we go
[1:49:43] amen praise the lord i still got lots i
[1:49:46] want to
[1:49:47] cover but we'll we'll catch it next time
[1:49:50] amen i'm looking forward to everything
[1:49:53] that god has in the millennium
[1:49:55] but i want to know lord how can i serve
[1:49:57] you right now
[1:49:59] you've called me to a great and shining
[1:50:02] light
[1:50:02] and i want to be a light to the world
[1:50:05] you know it's interesting
[1:50:07] that jesus talks about the eye
[1:50:11] you know and and and a lot of times when
[1:50:14] people talk about the lights
[1:50:15] the eyes being lamps they are they
[1:50:18] almost invariably
[1:50:21] think of it as coming this way that my
[1:50:23] eyes the gate
[1:50:25] to my soul and so if i look at the right
[1:50:28] things that image will come in and
[1:50:29] lighten my soul
[1:50:31] okay that's a valid point but in the
[1:50:34] majority in fact it's pretty much an
[1:50:35] overwhelming majority
[1:50:37] in the bible that that's that's not
[1:50:40] exactly
[1:50:42] what the eyes as light is really about
[1:50:47] that actually your lights are something
[1:50:50] to shine out
[1:50:52] light comes within you and shines out
[1:50:54] and jesus said let your light
[1:50:55] so shine that others may see
[1:50:59] see and so it's a it's a lot more than
[1:51:02] just
[1:51:02] having it come this way and we don't
[1:51:04] look at the wrong things because i want
[1:51:06] light to be in my
[1:51:07] but when you've got the love of god
[1:51:09] which is the light of god
[1:51:11] then that's then your light your eyes
[1:51:13] become headlights for the world
[1:51:16] your your eyes become lights
[1:51:19] for your family for your children
[1:51:22] for your friends for your parents for
[1:51:25] your spouses
[1:51:27] you're shining a light let
[1:51:30] your light shine
[1:51:34] this is the main order when you find
[1:51:36] that that parable in the scripture
[1:51:38] almost in every case with exception of a
[1:51:41] couple one or two maybe that i could
[1:51:42] even
[1:51:43] find it's it's not this way
[1:51:46] it's this way and that's really the
[1:51:49] point jesus is trying to
[1:51:51] to bring out is that your
[1:51:54] light that you shine forth can guide
[1:51:57] others
[1:51:58] how are you going to project light
[1:52:03] from within that you don't have
[1:52:07] you can only give out what you have
[1:52:10] within
[1:52:12] you can only project what's in you
[1:52:15] and if all that's in you is the gom
[1:52:17] that's an old-fashioned hillbilly word
[1:52:20] the muck and gom of the world we old
[1:52:22] carburetor days brother mark we know
[1:52:24] what a gummed up carburetor meant
[1:52:26] you had to get some they call it gum out
[1:52:29] and you had to spray it in a thing get
[1:52:30] all you know from the
[1:52:32] from the byproducts of the fuel and that
[1:52:35] thing would get sticky and
[1:52:36] you'd be under there revving it spraying
[1:52:38] in there
[1:52:40] trying to get it freed up and and and
[1:52:43] and if the if the the an engine only
[1:52:45] needs
[1:52:46] uh fire fuel and air
[1:52:50] and that's what makes a combustion
[1:52:51] engine go and if you get
[1:52:53] if you got a problem it's in one of
[1:52:54] those three it's either in
[1:52:56] no fire no fuel or no air i'm here to
[1:52:59] tell you something friends sometimes the
[1:53:00] world
[1:53:02] we feed on so much of the world our fuel
[1:53:05] is contaminated
[1:53:06] we breathe the wrong kind of air we get
[1:53:08] all gummed up we get all cont
[1:53:10] oh come on let's let's admit it today
[1:53:13] and say lord i need to be cleaned out
[1:53:16] i need to have the holy spirit come into
[1:53:18] my life
[1:53:19] and just flow and blow out all the
[1:53:22] carbon and the
[1:53:23] and the gum of the world lord i feed on
[1:53:25] too much of it it's made me sticky and
[1:53:27] i can't i i don't i'm losing horsepower
[1:53:30] and i can't hardly get
[1:53:31] go down the road lord i'm spitting and
[1:53:33] sputtering father you see hands up

[1:53:43] spirit in our lives

[1:53:46] open word to clean our hearts and clean
[1:53:48] our minds
[1:53:49] that we might be a light to the world
[1:53:51] and a light to our loved ones and
[1:53:52] shine the way that leads home
[1:53:55] [Music]
[1:53:56] master the ultimate light
[1:54:00] the ultimate light the bible talks and
[1:54:02] shows us in the book of revelation
[1:54:04] that the the source of the light comes
[1:54:07] from your throne
[1:54:09] so lord i just say to people listen just

[1:55:12] seed of the word

[1:55:16] sunlight of his word on it god
