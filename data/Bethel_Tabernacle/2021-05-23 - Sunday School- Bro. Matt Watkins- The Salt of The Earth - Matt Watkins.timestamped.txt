[0:01] [Music]
[2:41] and we're just going to read a familiar
[2:42] passage
[2:43] here
[2:49] you find this scripture that we're going
[2:51] to read uh in the book of matthew
[2:54] uh and today it's it's going to we're
[2:56] going to read it from
[2:57] luke it gives just a little bit more
[2:59] context but it's very familiar with us
[3:01] when jesus
[3:02] speaks and says that you are the salt of
[3:05] the earth i'd like to speak to you on
[3:07] that today
[3:08] you are the salt of the earth let's read
[3:10] verse 34.
[3:12] salt is good but if the salt has lost
[3:15] its savor
[3:17] wherewith shall it be seasoned it is
[3:19] neither fit for the land
[3:21] nor yet for the dunghill but men cast it
[3:24] out
[3:25] he that hath ears let him hear
[3:28] he that has ears to hear let him hear
[3:31] you can be seated this morning
[3:36] it's amazing when you study the
[3:40] the meaning of salt in the ancient world
[3:43] we always have taken the scripture many
[3:45] times and you've heard it preached or
[3:47] taught upon
[3:48] you are the salt of the earth and we
[3:50] relate to salt
[3:52] by seasoning for flavor and so
[3:54] immediately we think of
[3:56] salt of the earth and when jesus says
[3:58] this that he's referring to us
[4:01] uh he's referring to salt as we season
[4:04] food
[4:04] and so when you read that scripture and
[4:06] it says if the salt loses its savior
[4:08] wherewith shall it be salted we
[4:10] immediately think of
[4:11] seasoning for food but that's actually
[4:13] not at all
[4:14] in any way what jesus meant when he said
[4:17] it
[4:17] that's a good modern uh it sounds good
[4:21] but uh but it's not what jesus was
[4:23] meaning there's a much deeper meaning
[4:25] in that and to be the salt of the earth
[4:29] is what jesus speaks of in matthew
[4:31] uh chapter five when he's giving the
[4:34] beatitudes and he says blessed are the
[4:36] poor in spirit and he goes through all
[4:38] of the character
[4:39] of the christian let's look at that if
[4:41] we could in matthew chapter
[4:43] 5 this morning let's just look here just
[4:46] for a moment
[4:54] and if they have that for the screen you
[4:55] could put that up uh matthew let me just
[4:58] open it actually i have it on the study
[5:00] version but let me open it here
[5:03] and we'll just begin reading here in
[5:05] verse one and seeing the multitudes he
[5:07] went up into a mountain and when he was
[5:09] set his disciples came unto him
[5:11] and he opened his mouth and taught them
[5:13] saying blessed
[5:15] are the poor in spirit for theirs
[5:18] is the kingdom of heaven blessed
[5:22] now this is a good word here and it's
[5:24] the word
[5:25] that we it's amazing because the old
[5:27] testament when you look at the old
[5:29] testament it ends
[5:30] with a curse it ends talking about a
[5:32] curse when jesus comes on the scene
[5:34] his first sermon is when he opens his
[5:36] mouth is
[5:38] blessed and he speaks and says blessed
[5:41] it's a promise that he gives and he says
[5:43] blessed are the
[5:45] poor in spirit it's amazing
[5:48] because when he comes to this let me
[5:51] just pull it
[5:53] i want to make sure i have it on my
[5:54] screen correctly here blessed are the
[5:55] poor in spirit verse 3
[5:57] for theirs is the kingdom of heaven
[5:59] blessed are they that mourn for they
[6:00] shall be comforted blessed are the meek
[6:02] for they shall inherit the earth move
[6:04] all the way down here
[6:06] to verse 12. rejoice and be exceeding
[6:09] glad for great is your reward in heaven
[6:13] for so persecuted they the prophets
[6:16] which were before you verse 13
[6:20] you are the salt of the earth but if
[6:23] the salt have lost its savor wherewith
[6:26] shall it be salted it is
[6:28] fence forth good for nothing but to be
[6:31] cast out
[6:32] and to be under foot of men you
[6:35] are the light of the world
[6:38] a city that is set on a hill
[6:41] cannot be hid so he uses these two
[6:44] parallels
[6:45] you are the salt and you
[6:48] are the light now
[6:52] what's amazing about those two
[6:54] characteristics of salt and light
[6:57] is that in order for salt to have any
[6:59] purpose
[7:00] or value and in order for light to have
[7:03] any purpose or value it actually doesn't
[7:05] have to do anything
[7:07] there's no works that salt needs to
[7:09] perform
[7:10] in order to have a value salt has its
[7:14] value
[7:14] by being salt so it's not about what it
[7:18] does
[7:19] it's about what it is you follow that
[7:23] it's not about uh as uh you know my dad
[7:26] had that the testimony that he has about
[7:28] when the lord came to him about
[7:29] pastoring and he's got a sign on his
[7:31] door now
[7:32] the assistant pastor and is no longer
[7:34] pastor of the church but jesus
[7:36] is the pastor but you remember in his
[7:37] testimony he said the lord came to him
[7:39] and he said lord i want to do more for
[7:41] you
[7:42] i just want to do more for your kingdom
[7:43] i got to get busy and the lord spoke to
[7:45] him and said
[7:46] i don't need you to do more i need you
[7:49] to be more
[7:52] that's profound when you really think
[7:54] about it that's profound it's not in
[7:56] works the christian world
[7:59] has emphasized and this the nominal
[8:02] christian world has
[8:03] emphasized so much on works and what you
[8:06] can do
[8:07] to contact the world what you can do to
[8:10] affect your community and so
[8:13] by that basis they have their outreach
[8:16] and their ministries and their churches
[8:18] and everything is fitted and geared
[8:20] towards what they can do in the
[8:22] community and they do some many
[8:24] wonderful things that the the the you
[8:26] just take even just the
[8:28] uh the soup suppers that they have and
[8:31] the
[8:32] uh the um uh i'm trying to remember what
[8:35] it's called there brother charles that
[8:36] you work at the
[8:37] the food pantry yeah where where you you
[8:40] know so they're doing
[8:41] there's many wonderful things that
[8:43] they're doing for the community but it's
[8:45] been an
[8:45] emphasis on what they can do and they've
[8:48] missed that
[8:49] jesus didn't say when jesus was to tell
[8:52] the church what they're to be it wasn't
[8:53] about what they can go into the world
[8:55] and do
[8:56] for the world it was what they can be
[8:59] for it's only in you
[9:00] being what god made you to be that you
[9:03] can change the world
[9:06] and so therefore we're not salt
[9:09] as in pepper and salt
[9:13] it's not about how much if we just
[9:15] sprinkle enough christians in the world
[9:17] it'll you know sprinkle a little salt in
[9:19] the world it'll change the world that's
[9:20] not what it is
[9:21] that's why jesus said if the salt loses
[9:23] its savior in other words
[9:25] we're going to get into that what he was
[9:26] meaning there in a minute but it was the
[9:28] quality of what
[9:30] salt is by being salt
[9:33] light doesn't have to do anything except
[9:35] be light
[9:38] and a real christian all you have to do
[9:40] is be
[9:41] a real christian be a christian
[9:44] and you'll make a difference in the
[9:46] world what kind of difference
[9:49] how do we make a difference by being
[9:51] salt
[9:53] by being salt how do we make a
[9:55] difference by being what we are by not
[9:58] mixing it notice what he says here you
[10:00] are the salt of the earth
[10:02] but if the salt has lost its savor
[10:04] wherewith shall it be started in luke
[10:06] chapter 14 verse 34. he says salt is
[10:09] good but if the salt is lost at savor
[10:11] wherewith shall it be ceased now notice
[10:12] what he says here
[10:13] it is neither fit for the land nor yet
[10:16] for the dung kill
[10:18] so he in he immediately gives you a
[10:20] reference as to the importance of salt
[10:23] salt was actually used for a fertilizer
[10:25] to ground
[10:27] and so they would put salt in the earth
[10:30] this is why jesus says you are the salt
[10:32] of the earth there's the there's
[10:34] there's what he's meaning salt was used
[10:37] for fertilizer and with the right amount
[10:40] of salt
[10:40] it could the seed could grow
[10:44] and then he he says so he says it's
[10:46] neither fit for the land
[10:48] nor yet for the dung now what does he
[10:51] mean when he says salt is good but if
[10:52] the salt has lost its
[10:54] savor wherewith shall it be seasoned you
[10:57] see
[10:58] back in the ancient times to to be the
[11:01] salt of the earth the romans were
[11:03] actually they especially in that culture
[11:07] other than the sun there was nothing
[11:09] more
[11:10] valuable than salt that's why you get
[11:12] the
[11:13] word that we have even coined today the
[11:15] phrase or is he worth his salt
[11:18] ever said that about somebody he's not
[11:20] worth his salt she's not worth her
[11:22] you know he's a you speak of that as a
[11:24] worker you know are they worth their
[11:25] salt
[11:26] and so that's where they get that's
[11:27] where it was coined from because
[11:30] to a roman salt was very valuable in
[11:33] fact
[11:33] romans were paid with salt
[11:37] because salt was very important it
[11:38] wasn't salt what we use now today it
[11:41] wasn't about
[11:42] uh we've got to season our food but
[11:44] actually it's how it was your fertilizer
[11:49] he says he says it's not he says if the
[11:52] salt has lost
[11:53] its savior so it was it was
[11:56] it was uh uh taken from the ocean from
[12:00] the dead sea
[12:01] and they would take this salt now when s
[12:03] when people would sell
[12:05] the salt because salt was very valuable
[12:07] you know
[12:08] they would uh as a way to uh
[12:11] you know to to uh it was it was a it was
[12:14] a cruel business practice
[12:16] but they would mix in sand with the salt
[12:20] and when you bought it you thought you
[12:22] had a pound of salt but you actually had
[12:24] about
[12:24] a quarter of a salt and three quarters
[12:27] dirt
[12:29] and so this is what jesus this is
[12:31] amazing when i read this this morning
[12:32] this is actually what jesus
[12:34] means when he says look in luke chapter
[12:37] 14 look it against
[12:38] verse 34 salt is good but if the salt
[12:42] has lost its savor
[12:44] you know for years i looked at them and
[12:45] said see if the salt isn't salty
[12:47] that's that's a that's a that's a
[12:49] paradox that's ca i mean not a paradox
[12:51] it's a it's
[12:52] impossible the salt can't lose its savor
[12:55] salt doesn't not become salt salt is
[12:57] salt
[13:00] you follow what i'm saying if the salt
[13:02] has lost its savor with the salt
[13:03] that means if the salt isn't salty
[13:05] anymore what the hell is that's possible
[13:07] because salt is salt it's you don't have
[13:10] some salt that's not salty you will
[13:12] never taste salt that's not salty if
[13:14] it's salt
[13:15] so jesus wasn't meaning that if we lose
[13:17] our flavor
[13:19] you know if a christian loses its flavor
[13:21] if it loses its
[13:22] saltiness what's he saying if it if it's
[13:25] mixed
[13:26] with the world if it's mixed with the
[13:29] dirt if it's mixed with other things if
[13:32] it's not
[13:32] salt that's what jesus is saying if it's
[13:35] not
[13:35] pure salt and it's hybrid with other
[13:38] things
[13:39] then it loses its savor
[13:42] because it's no longer pure salt it's
[13:44] mixed with other things
[13:46] you see why the importance that we keep
[13:49] our
[13:50] lives pure and unadulterated from the
[13:53] world
[13:55] but what has the world what has the
[13:57] church world done they've
[13:58] mixed the world with the gospel
[14:02] and now it's flavorless salt
[14:07] it's lost its savor and jesus says
[14:10] it's neither fit for the land because if
[14:12] you took that salt that was mixed with
[14:14] dirt and tried to use it as fertilizer
[14:16] guess what it's not going to work
[14:19] if you took now he says here nor yet for
[14:22] the dung kill
[14:23] lotus verse 35 the first 35 nor yet for
[14:26] the dunghill so what they didn't have
[14:28] toilets like we have today you go and
[14:30] flush the toilet
[14:31] so you had something in your backyard a
[14:33] mound this may get very
[14:35] uh gross for you here today but i'm just
[14:38] gonna tell you what jesus meant when he
[14:40] said it you'd use the bathroom in the
[14:41] backyard
[14:43] you'd have a spot in the ancient days
[14:45] and they would they would have a
[14:46] they would have a pile of dirt where you
[14:48] use the bathroom
[14:51] and in order to now not use fertilizer
[14:54] now it's not going to be a blessing it's
[14:55] it's going to curse
[14:57] it's going to curse the land they would
[14:59] use salt and throw salt
[15:01] on the dung hill
[15:04] and so jesus is using the reference here
[15:06] and he says but if the salt is mixed
[15:09] it's lost its effect it's lost its power
[15:12] it's lost its ability it's not good
[15:14] he says it's not fit for the land look
[15:16] at verse 35.
[15:18] it is neither fit for the land nor
[15:21] yet for the dunghill but men
[15:25] cast it out he that hath ears to hear
[15:28] let him hear in other words jesus is
[15:30] saying i'm not talking about salt used
[15:32] for fertilizer are used for the dung
[15:33] hill
[15:34] you got to think deeper than that if
[15:36] you've got an ear hear what the spirit
[15:37] is saying to the churches
[15:40] you are the salt of the earth
[15:43] be i don't need you to do i need you to
[15:46] be
[15:48] i don't need you to do something it's
[15:49] not about what you can do we so many
[15:51] times as christians spend so much time
[15:53] on what can i do for the lord what can i
[15:55] do for the lord
[15:55] what can i do for my community what can
[15:57] i do to outreach and make a difference
[16:00] be a christian how do we evangelize is
[16:04] it by
[16:05] you know we can do many great things
[16:06] there's there's some awesome things that
[16:08] we can do we they
[16:09] the last night at the uh brother ken
[16:12] boos at his re
[16:13] at his uh coffee shop there had a had an
[16:15] outdoor singing it was wonderful
[16:16] wonderful outreach and it's you so we do
[16:20] things there's mediums that we use
[16:22] to contact the world but i can promise
[16:24] you that
[16:25] if if in contacting them we mix some
[16:28] worldliness with our
[16:30] salt what will it produce
[16:34] it'll produce a worldly church and what
[16:37] what you find is that the world the
[16:41] the the mixing this is what jesus was
[16:43] warning against the
[16:44] mixing of worldliness into the dirt
[16:48] the mixing the worldness into the salt
[16:50] and jesus says it's lost its
[16:52] savior wherewhat shall it be seasoned it
[16:55] is neither fit for the land nor yet for
[16:56] the dungeon but men
[16:58] cast it out they throw it on the roadway
[16:59] they have no use for it
[17:01] and let me say this this is so this is
[17:05] this is so powerful what brother branham
[17:07] speaks about when he talks about a real
[17:08] christian and he says the world is
[17:10] looking they're thirsting for a
[17:13] real christian they're thirsting for
[17:17] they don't want the world doesn't want
[17:19] our mixed hybridized worldly
[17:21] gospel message they lose respect for
[17:24] that in fact that jesus is saying they
[17:26] they what is he saying he says when the
[17:28] church is
[17:29] mixed up and and and there's that you're
[17:32] not it's not
[17:33] pure and it's mixed in it's compromised
[17:37] oh we've got to be you know we've got to
[17:39] reach the youth so
[17:41] you know in order to reach the youth you
[17:42] know we've got to take our christian
[17:44] lyrics we'll put it with rock and roll
[17:45] music and then we'll have rock christian
[17:47] rock concerts and it'll bring them all
[17:49] in is this what jesus said
[17:54] jesus says no when you do that when you
[17:57] mix it
[17:58] and the salt loses its savor it's not
[18:01] good for anything
[18:03] and actually the response will be
[18:06] contempt
[18:09] that the world will will look at
[18:11] christianity with disgust
[18:14] that's all you got that's don't you
[18:16] realize the world is wanting the real
[18:19] they're wanting the real salt not the
[18:21] mixed salt they're wanting the real
[18:23] thing that has
[18:24] power that has an effect that brings
[18:27] change
[18:29] and brother branham says the world's
[18:30] looking for that they're thirsting to
[18:32] see they've seen
[18:33] so much of the counterfeit that's all
[18:36] you got to do you say how do i witness
[18:37] to my community
[18:38] be a christian as the
[18:42] you know the um you know the well how
[18:44] does the how does this saying go that
[18:46] you know if you preach us to to preach a
[18:49] sermon and if necessary use words
[18:52] so you live a sermon you live it out by
[18:54] your life
[18:56] that's what the world's looking for what
[18:57] can i do to affect my unsaved loved one
[19:00] just be a christian
[19:01] don't compromise and many times we get
[19:05] well i you know i don't want to be too
[19:06] ex i got to sort of sort of you know
[19:09] dole the word down a little bit don't
[19:10] give it to them so
[19:12] so sharp and and you know i gotta sort
[19:14] of
[19:15] uh peop listen we're all guilty of this
[19:18] you know i sort of gotta i can't be so
[19:21] you know um
[19:22] they'll think i'm weird well
[19:26] they'll think i'm strange well you'll
[19:28] get their attention
[19:31] you'll get their attention be a real
[19:32] christian you'll get their attention
[19:34] nothing else is getting their attention
[19:37] what is the message of
[19:38] as we said the message of the church
[19:41] mixed in
[19:42] uh with worldliness what's it done it's
[19:45] not it's
[19:46] made the world it's it's made the world
[19:49] have a can have a contempt or a disgust
[19:52] towards christianity i don't want
[19:55] nothing to do with that why would i want
[19:57] anything to do with that
[19:58] a gospel message that doesn't have power
[20:01] that doesn't clean
[20:02] lives it's about character
[20:07] and this is powerful the romans chapter
[20:10] 8
[20:11] very familiar scripture verse 28 it says
[20:14] and we know that all things work
[20:16] together for the good to them that love
[20:18] god to him to them who are called
[20:20] according to his purpose
[20:22] for whom he did for no he also did
[20:24] predestinate to be
[20:26] conformed to the image of his
[20:30] son so this was what was important that
[20:33] we don't project our own life
[20:35] but we're conformed to the image our
[20:38] life is a projector
[20:39] of the image of the sun the son of god
[20:42] that he might be the firstborn
[20:44] among many brethren listen to what
[20:47] brother branham says here he says now
[20:49] jesus
[20:50] gave us the example i didn't have time
[20:52] to put it up for you to read he says
[20:54] jesus gave us the example of what we
[20:56] ought to be looking at
[20:58] when he reflected his life
[21:01] to us through the word what we
[21:04] should see when we look into god's
[21:07] mirror
[21:09] we should see ourselves identified
[21:13] with him that is a perfect
[21:17] example that is a perfect
[21:21] example now but we find out that as long
[21:24] as we go along through life
[21:26] that our character molds the image
[21:30] that we are each one knows that he says
[21:33] you just he says he says each one know
[21:36] that your character
[21:37] molds you to what you are now you have
[21:40] seen people that you just
[21:42] love to be around yet they might not
[21:44] exactly be in your bracket or society
[21:47] and again they might be of a different
[21:49] race he says the
[21:51] the brown the yellow the white the black
[21:53] but there's just
[21:54] something about that character
[21:58] that you just love to be in their
[22:00] presence
[22:03] you know you know when i've you know you
[22:05] know who he's speaking of that
[22:07] that i think of believers
[22:11] christians i don't even have to know
[22:12] them but if you get around a real
[22:14] believer
[22:15] you get around a real christian there's
[22:17] just an ad an affinity that you have
[22:20] with them
[22:21] whether they speak your language or not
[22:22] you go to go to overseas
[22:25] you know you can't even sometimes the
[22:26] people can't even speak your
[22:28] language when you get outside and they
[22:30] just shake your hand and smile
[22:32] and you can't say anything but god bless
[22:34] you and they may know that much english
[22:36] and they can't say much more back
[22:38] you could tell they're bursting wanting
[22:39] to tell you what they thought about your
[22:41] sermon and everything that you said
[22:43] but you can't there's no conversation
[22:45] but yet there's a
[22:47] language that you're speaking one with
[22:49] another the language of a believer
[22:50] brother madam says it's that character
[22:52] he says there's just something about
[22:54] that character that you just love to be
[22:56] in their presence because each person
[22:59] is a little dynamo of their own and you
[23:02] put out an atmosphere whether you
[23:06] realize it or not
[23:07] your life is a little dynamo and it puts
[23:10] out
[23:11] an atmosphere
[23:14] and and jesus says you are the salt of
[23:17] the earth just be
[23:19] salt don't worry about what you can do
[23:22] just
[23:23] be a christian be a real believer
[23:26] just be what god made you to be and and
[23:29] and
[23:29] be it don't hide it that's what jesus
[23:31] says he talks about as you are the light
[23:33] of the
[23:33] world it says does men light a candle to
[23:35] hide it no but it's a city set on a hill
[23:37] what's important for the salt how's the
[23:39] salt going to get into the
[23:40] how how's the salt going to have an
[23:42] effect it's got to get into the earth
[23:44] it's got to you know if we just if all
[23:47] of our salt is
[23:48] is this church is just a big storehouse
[23:51] of salt and it never goes out into the
[23:53] earth how are we ever going to impact
[23:54] the world
[23:56] but you've got to take that atmosphere
[23:58] you've got to take that life and you've
[23:59] got to spread it into
[24:01] the uttermost parts of the earth and he
[24:04] says each is a little dynamo
[24:05] you put out an atmosphere then you see
[24:08] people that were noble people
[24:10] but yet you were always glad to get away
[24:12] from them
[24:14] yeah i've been around some people like
[24:16] that he says you've seen people and
[24:19] you're just always glad
[24:20] man i'm so glad i'm away from that
[24:21] person even noble
[24:23] it's just they create such an atmosphere
[24:26] around where you
[24:28] are nothing against them they're nice
[24:30] people
[24:31] but you just don't like that atmosphere
[24:33] they're in and they're
[24:34] and their character creates whatever
[24:37] they are makes them what they are we're
[24:41] out of time let's stand up
[24:43] stand to our feet

[24:48] christ-like
