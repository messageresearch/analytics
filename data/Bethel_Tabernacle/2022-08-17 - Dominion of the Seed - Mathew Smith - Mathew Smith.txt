up like [Music] i will soar with your [Music] amen it's good to be in church tonight [Applause] all right um y'all gideon i had my powerpoint already pulled up did you see it all right let's uh go ahead and turn right to the word um turn to genesis chapter one and you can just go straight to powerpoint we're just going to read one one short verse of scripture here so genesis chapter 1 and verse 26 um uh yeah and god said let us make man in our image after our likeness and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea over the fowl of the air and over the cattle and over the earth and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth so god created man in his own image god created he him male and female created he them and god blessed them and god said unto them be fruitful and multiply and replenish the earth and subdue it and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the air and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth amen let's have a word of prayer father i come before you this this evening and i ask that you would be with me allow me to step out of the way give me the strength to be open and to be to be clear that i would not have maybe some obstruction to what you would have to say that any any spirit or nerves that i would have that it wouldn't create a an obstruction that you'd be able to speak clearly to the people father that they would be able to take some word from you not of anything that i would be able to to concoct or contrive or or write or put together but it would be that it would be completely made by you to speak to the people that they would hear something from you father that because it is only by your words that we live it's only by your word that we will survive this dark day father i ask these things in the holy and precious name of the lord jesus christ amen y'all can be seated so um i want to as a title i would take the dominion of the seed and um i want to uh oh where's where's my clicker i have the power all right all right um so uh i wanted to this is a familiar uh scripture um if for y'all y'all who um uh were in my sunday school classes about um biology and stuff i know we read some of this so a little bit of this is gonna be recap right at the beginning just because it's been a minute since i did that and maybe some of y'all weren't here for that so um this is genesis chapter 1 verse 11 and god said let the earth bring forth grass and her building seed the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind whose seed is in itself upon the earth and it was so and the earth brought forth grass and herb yielding seed after its kind of the tree yielding fruit whose seed was in itself after his kind and god saw that it was good and then verse 21 and god created great whales and every living creature that moveth which the waters brought forth abundantly after their kind and every winged fowl after his kind and god saw that it was good and god blessed them saying be fruitful and multiply and fill the waters in the seas and let fowl multiply in the earth or in the air yeah in the earth excuse me um is uh am i not holding this mic high enough do i need to am i good okay drop my my uh monitors if you wouldn't mind i don't like hearing myself and it weirds me out um so uh and then and then where we um in verse 24 here and it says god said let the earth bring forth the living creatures after his kind cattle and creeping things and beasts of the earth after his kind and it was so and god made the beast of the earth after his kind and cattle after their kind and everything they creeped with upon the earth after his kind and god saw that it was good and god said let us make man in our own image and in our likeness and we'll skip down because we already read this and god blessed them and god said unto them be fruitful and multiply and replenish the earth and subdue it and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the air and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth and so we see this progression and and um what there's a couple i would say key principles that i i see in these verses um the first one is this idea that we would might sum up as very simply as every seed bring it forth after its own kind right it's god commanding every type of creature every type of living thing that he has put a a seed an instruction manual inside of it on how to live and how to how its nature should be fulfilled how its nature nature should be expressed what it would look like what it would do what it would act like how it would live and how it would then would also reproduce that seed and multiply that seed and he tells every type of creature every type of living thing to be fruitful and multiply in one way or another right um and so the the the the um the sort of the the driving force behind all of nature is the sort of the replication of the seed okay and so um so the the the uh what you know we talked about with the with the seed inside of us that you know it sort of controls the nature that that you know if you get off that seed then you get mutations you get cancer you get all sorts of diseases uh like viral infections are are actually a hijacking of the seed expression systems once inside of people and it's the introduction of what we would think of is like a seed of discrepancy um and so it's all back to expressing that seed in the way that god intended it to be expressed okay if you get off of that then you're going to have major problems right the creature won't live and likewise the cri in the in the body of christ if if people get off of off of the word the seed word that god put inside of us you're gonna end up with all sorts of mutations all sorts of all sorts of catastrophe and it's gonna be a huge problem right cancer and everything else you know spiritual cancer you know people uh you know we might have talked about this before but really what cancer is is is a particular kind of cell oftentimes reading bits of the dna that it wasn't intended to actually fulfill right this is where you get you know somebody uh taking scriptures that doesn't apply to them you know it's all part of the word but it doesn't really apply to you and trying to fulfill something that god never called them to right and then you end up you know with a liver cell trying to be a pancreas cell or an eye cell well you don't want an eyeball in your liver things go badly if that happens um right um and you also don't want a liver in your eyeball that's also a problem the um but you know and so you see how when people get out of their order get out of out of place it causes a bunch of chaos and destruction and so one of the things that that struck me that i struggled with a lot you know i had a background in biology and and sort of pre-medical science and stuff and especially as a new christian one of the things that i really struggled with was how is it that you know i know that you know that maybe the theory of evolution is wrong but all of medicine all of biology is based on it right i mean they no you don't go into the medical field without it just sort of being assumed that that's how everything came to be and yet there's so much of biology that isn't wrong right in the small scale like it's it's actually true and they get a lot of mileage out of that theory of evolution yet somehow it's wrong right and so it i struggled with this until you know i was it just never made sense to me and so i was reading through this and it occurred to me um uh so on this first bullet you know one of the key principles here is we call the central dogma of biology that's the phrase that the medical or the scientific world uses for this idea that every genetic code every set of dna reproduces itself right the central dogma of biology is just a sort of scientific medical phrase for every scene breaks brings forth after its own kind right and so the reason it's the central dogma of biology is because it's also the thing that kind of props up the theory of evolution right the and so really what the theory of evolution did is the reason they get so much mileage out of it is because it actually has biblical principles in it but they try to snip god out of the picture right they took a a razor blade and cut got out of the picture and then so they do get some truth out of the deal right they can get a certain measure of truth but it's never going to be they're going to struggle right and so what we see um you know in this sort of this idea that um part of this you know central dogma of biology and you know uh that that every creature has this drive to sort of reproduce the seed is we get some it once you think of it in that perspective that every creature is their goal and motivation is to reproduce their the seed that god put inside of them and fulfill that first commandment you know god did not command all creatures all of nature to live a long and happy life he said be fruitful and multiply right like it's you know sort of implicit in that is maybe live a long and happy life you can't really be fruitful multiply if you're dead um but the the actual command there was to really reproduce you know let that seed manifest and not just stay with you but to express out into the world and because of this once you think of it in this in this context a lot of stuff in nature starts to make sense it doesn't really make a whole lot of sense right so for instance you take something like um a peacock doesn't make a whole lot of sense if you're trying to live a long and happy life because he's got all this giant plumage that requires a bunch of he's going to eat a lot of food to grow these giant feathers it gets stuff caught in it so he's got to groom it all the time it's a giant thing that predators can snatch and eat you know eat the bird with and he tries to fly away and he's got a parachute behind him right like it's it's a it's a real problem why would he do this well it's because if he doesn't have those that plumage he's gonna you know kind of sidle up to that that pee hand and be like how's it going and she's gonna be like well you are the ugliest woman i've ever seen and you know and and the he's he's doesn't stand a chance right and this is this is his purpose is not gonna be fulfilled there right that that command that he has that's that's driving him his purpose of being can never be fulfilled without that so it's it's if he lived to be a hundred years old without that plumage he might live to be a hundred years old but he's not going to fulfill his purpose right and likewise we get i mean you get all kinds of crazy stuff you know things like lions kill each other over over you know control over over mating rights i mean if you're if you're trying to live a long time don't get into the conflict you don't want to die right right but because it's important to you the the right um you see this a lot in the insect world bug and insects the males get their heads ripped off and eaten that doesn't make any sense at all right if my purpose was survival i'm not going anywhere near that but my purpose isn't survival it's fulfilling the drive that god put in me to reproduce the seed and this is where you know i i in a phrase the purpose of the creature is not the creature rather the purpose of the creature is the seed okay what's really the life here is it me with my thoughts and ideas and whatever or is the seed inside of me that's actually controlling all that right is it this flesh guy or is this flesh guy just sort of a meat robot that the seed is driving around in order to fulfill the purpose that god put in it right like what's what's really happening here who's whose life is really here right and i'm gonna take a drink of water here and um so there's another moving on there's another thing here is that um unfortunately i didn't have time to put it in my notes or in my powerpoint here but um brother branham says several times throughout the message he talks about it's just as an allegory you know um god you know the fish has a fit on his back because there was a water if there wasn't a water firm to swim in then he never would have a fin on his back there had to be an earth for the tree to grow in before there could have been a tree things like this um and so it's this notion and you see it in in genesis in as it progresses you know god makes the earth and he you know separates the waters from the land before he plants the trees and then once the trees are planted then you know the fowls of the air and things like that can grow there had to be oceans that separated before the fish could grow in there excuse me there had to be plants and herb yielding seed and fruit-bearing trees existed before the beasts of the field could come along to eat them you know like there has to be this environment set up before the creatures can really live in it and um it's showing that every creature is sort of a model after its environment right you you you're you're fit you're built to live in a certain kind of environment amen which um sort of by extension you would say if the life if the real purpose of the creature was a life living inside of it then you are the environment that god built to live in there had to be a you before there could be a god in you right and so but but going at this um uh yeah creatures are modeled after environment so we see pictures like this right um the little desert lizard there uh the horn toad there's our cool little critters all over the southwest got the leaf bug there in the corner and then i really like that picture of the snow hair because it's kind of in the middle you know kind of transition right these are all creatures that you don't really necessarily need to see their environment to know what they are you you know what their environment looks like without having to actually see the environment you could just see the creature and know what it looks like right likewise um people you can look at people and you can see the things that they're expressing the things they do and the way they act and you can see the environment that they've built for themselves you don't have to know anything about it right you know i've heard you know brother burley's i remember when being young and he he made this this point you have you see a little girl and she's got um she's got her baby doll and she's beating the tar out of that baby doll telling it how wretched it is right she saw that somewhere right the something happened that caused that i i the environment that i work in i see this all the time um i you know work with a lot of people who have a lot of broken homes and it's you see that the i can look at somebody's kids and know the way they treat those kids and the way they act around those kids you know you got an eight-year-old kid that has a vocabulary that'll make a marine blush and then you're like what in the world how did you can't even spell yet like how do you know what any of this is and then you go into the home and you hear the mom screaming at her kids using that kind of language like okay right the the environment that you build around yourself those kids are a model of the environment that they were put in right likewise parents if you see something that your kids are doing that you really don't like just consider and i know there's that whole thing of like well number one the guy who doesn't have any kids telling parents how to raise their kids and two um two also god was like how are you gonna say that god wasn't a good parent and his kids rebelled too i get it the point you know teenagers especially like to rebel but also seriously you know you you do not just throw your kids into the bus and just say they're rebellious teenagers i mean you ultimately are sort of responsible for the environment and um but yeah so we look at at people here and so we see guys like this right it's a picture of some guys and we can see this is pretty obvious what they do right they're they're construction workers it's you didn't wouldn't have to see them on the job site you could just see them with their hats and their their high visibility vests and their you know muddy boots and you would know their purpose you would know what their goals in life are you know a whole lot about them just by their outfit right you got this guy it's pretty clear what this guy does right pretty obvious you don't need to know a whole lot of you don't even you can't even see really an environment in this picture yet you know what kind of environment he's expecting to be in right he's a soldier right here's this guy he's got his nice vote for me smile and his vote for me button he's a criminal like this is this is um right i mean you know a lot about these people's environment based on the way they dress and their purposes and their motivations in life you know these guys are building stuff this guy i mean so look so just something that i noticed he's got night vision on his helmet what does this tell you about what kind of battle he's looking to fight right you know you can tell the way people people behave you know um the other thing that stuck out to me is not only he's a soldier he's a modern soldier he's looking to fight a fight a cutting-edge war not he's not dragging some outdated technology to go fight his battles right how many christians are walking around with their whole armor of god outdated technology they're dragging some wooden shield of faith out of luther's day to fight the devil and he's not throwing fiery darts anymore he's got armor-piercing round you know armor-piercing incendiary rounds right he's gonna blow right through that like you you better be carrying some you know level four titanium reinforced ballistic shield of rapturing faith or you're done right like it's it's over amen you know and and furthermore you know uh when brother berry was here he did the the men's um breakfast and he talked about how god will test you you know with the for those men that were there the with the bicycle tire you know he patched it and put the air in it and you you find the leak then you patch it and you test it again after it's been repaired to ensure that the repair stuck and when he said that it recalled to me a sermon that my dad preached many years ago about the acid test right about how when you're testing gold you put a mark you test take the piece of gold and you put acid on it and the different grades of acid if that gold breaks down under a certain grade of acid you know what kind of gold like how pure that gold is you know is it you know 12 14 18 karat 24 karat gold right um and so he makes this he made this statement and always stuck with me and he says look why is it that god puts people to the test if god knows everything right because it's not he knows whether you're going to pass or fail it's not for god to know it's so that you can know right it's so you can know it's so that when you encounter some it's god is letting you know hey you thought you were at a certain level and maybe you didn't quite make it so you need to you need to fix your patch and go back into the tank okay or alternatively is to let you have faith in the power of god to grow you as a christian right it's and so often times you know as christians look in the mirror of god's word everybody thinks that they know themselves so much but you don't know what you look like because you can't see your own face right nobody can look at their own face without a mirror look in the mirror of god's word and it'll tell you what you actually look like and it'll tell you if you're dragging some outdated technology out it'll tell you if you're if your kit if your your gear is not in line if it's not up to snuff because you want to check it with the mirror of the word before you check it on the battlefield right so um and this guy's just a crook um so um i wanted to kind of tell a little story here um i i one of the things that that stuck out to me um that i learned about is uh pigs um everybody kind of knows if i you know say what a pig look you ask you to think of a pig you look a sing from something like this kind of a pink little creature that is kind of fat and oinks and has questionable building practices and a long-standing blood feud with a big bad wolf right like this isn't he's he's a particular kind of thing and he has a particular kind of attitude however god didn't really invent that creature right um god invented that creature okay these two creatures are genetically identical the seed inside of them is the same okay the difference is that the one on the left has been run through thousands of years of domestication that there was a man-made system farming industrial system that came into place that said this creature on the right which by the way is just to make a point here nobody's scared of the guy on the on the left right he's he's docile he's he's not scary the guy on the right will kill you okay pigs are kind of a joke now they weren't a joke a couple thousand years ago um i mean it was typical typically you find in archaeological sites you find iconography of a wild boar as associated with like the most powerful and crazy warriors like you would think of like a dragon or a snake or a tiger or something like that um i once heard a story i mean i don't know it's a hunting tale through a couple different peoples who knows if it's true but um the it was a story about a guy some old farmer in arkansas who was hunting um had some giant like razorback up in the arkansas hills up on his farm and he was trying to hunt this thing down and eventually when he got it cornered up in its lair um is this enormous bore and when it was all said and done that boar killed 19 dogs and three horses in one go okay by himself these creatures are nothing to mess with but yet and when i look at this i fear i feel like how has the man-made system this this sort of farming industry complex that has cropped up across the world has taken this undominable warrior creature and turned it into a bacon machine right that no one is afraid of and it's it's because we put them in a pin and we feed them sweet corn and they don't have to work and they just lay in their pen in their slop and they don't have to do anything they don't have to fight there's no big bad wolves coming for them and it's easy and it's soft and it's relaxing and there's lots of carnal entertainment to feed on and you know um this creature that this warrior beast of faith that britain brother bram talked about faith with muscles and hair on its chest is gone it's been completely crushed they both have the same seed that guy on the on the left he's got everything within him to be this warrior beast and he's not because his outside has been completely conformed to the man-made system right to the to the man-made purpose god had a purpose for him but man had a purpose for him too the devil had a purpose for him too and the devil conformed his flesh man into something completely out of line with the seed within him okay and um and you know so and it took i mean granted it took thousands of years right for thousands of years to do that but over time it happens and by now we who were born in laodicea were born little pink pigs right we're born that way we'll grow up that way we will die that way and our kids will be that way and that's it right that's just there's nothing else that they have to do as long as they keep them in the right environment they will continue to reproduce even though their seed doesn't dictate this they will continue to reproduce in the form that the devil intended for them okay so i when i this was in my mind and i i decided that i wanted to tell a a story um if my clicker will decide to oh there we go i had katie draw this for me um i'm gonna tell you the story of the two little pigs um so i have in my i had in my mind like this this this image like a parable maybe of this these two pigs right and they grow up on a farm the farm is called laodicea and they're little pink pigs and they grow up and they they live on this farm and every day they go out another pig pen and they eat their carnal entertainment brand pig feed and sweet corn and they live in their you know laodicea environment and you know farmer lucifer keeps them well in line and growing them up to be to serve the purpose of lucifer and the and the laodicean farm and um we'll call i don't know one of them will be named peter and the other one will be named napoleon because why not um so uh peter and napoleon are going along living their lives and um one day peter's like you know um i don't i don't know why but i really feel like this is wrong something about the system feels wrong like there's something on my insides that doesn't really align with this i can't put my little paw on it but i can tell that there's something this is like a hatred for this like a rage inside of me that wants to kick get rid of this get away from this because i just feel and i and i know that there used to be a time when christians didn't behave this way christians didn't live in this kind of a system right we were built for something different we were built for a different kind of environment a system that wasn't so civilized didn't have a bunch of civilization and technology and we have a nice nice a lot of luxury to live in and it's nice but man it really doesn't seem like it's produced something in line with what we were built to be and napoleon's like whatever dude just eat your food right like whatever like what are you complaining about we have so many nice things are do you really want to revert back to the stone age you know like is that really what you're wanting you know like what are you trying to be amish and the and he's just like no i just feel like this is wrong and so they you know they go on well one day they're just eating their feet and and they're they look over the fence and to their shock in amazement there's another pig out there and this pig doesn't look like they do this pig is all hairy and he's got tusks and it's kind of pretty in a weird sort of way and he's like wow i didn't know girl pigs could look like that anymore and there's something about this and and napoleon's like dude she's they're they're weird they're like in a cult don't look at them right like they're just weirdos they live some sort of old-fashioned pig lifestyle um you don't want any part of that right they're gonna you're gonna you're gonna end up in like a cabin in the woods and it's just gonna be horrible and the and he's like yeah i know but whatever's inside of me says that's right right there's something said inside of me that says that was more what we were intended to live as and i can't feel fulfilled doing what i'm doing every day this lifestyle that i've built where we just kind of play fast and loose with morality and and sort of just treat people any old way doesn't really click with me because there's something wrong about it i don't know why but i just can't doesn't feel right to me and it's just sort and he's like napoleon's like my brother my precious sweet brother do not get caught up in a cult i don't want to have to go after you just just just don't just don't think about it he's like i can't i can't not a couple days later peter just can't take it anymore and he makes a run for it and he runs off into the woods and napoleon's like oh no they got him right my poor sweet brother has been brainwashed he's been brainwashed by this cult and who knows what's gonna happen he's gonna get eaten by wolves and it's terrible i am here in this farm perfectly safe a couple weeks later there's his brother he sees him peter come over here dude where did you go what happened to you why did you disappear everybody's been worried sick about you you know it's such luxury why do you live the way that you do you know everything's so prosperous over here you know if you're playing you know edging the line of what's morally right in your business you know you have a lot of luxury i have a nice barn to live in and a prosperous lifestyle because i don't care if my wife raises her kids in the in the godly calling that she god gave her in the bible and we just sort of let the but the world and the system raise our kids to become just like we were born you know we don't we don't worry so much about what you know and so it gives us a lot more money we can go on a lot more vacations because we have a two-income household see you're so worried about just some archaic notion that you know a nuclear family should be in line with the bible and that the mother should raise the children and so now you know um you're struggling financially and having to you know scrape around in the dirt whereas we have this nice you know we have this delicious corn this delicious carnal entertainment brand sweet corn pig feed you know it's delicious it's wonderful and you're telling me that you don't want to eat it isn't it wonderful isn't it delicious don't you like it right and peter's like look i think there's you're you're missing something here okay i think there's some there's parts of this that you're really not understanding my brother napoleon you're living on this farm but i think there's more to that than you really you really know and napoleon's like forget about it everybody loves me here we have a great society the cows and the chickens and the dogs and everybody loves me just the other day i went to the county fair and they put a big blue ribbon around my neck i have social i have social acceptance i'm i'm i'm first prize everybody loves me and peter's like did it ever occur to you that that blue ribbon has some implications that you're not considering right the fact that the farmer really likes you might have some implications that you're not considering the fact that laodicea and all of society really likes you might have some implications that you're not considering right this society that openly declares hatred of god and is built by satan to hate god if they really like you there are some implications to that that you are not considering right and peter says brother napoleon you see i've come out of that system and i'm looking at it from the outside that system keeps you in a nice pretty pen and it's clean and there's a lot of luxury in it and it's soft and it's easy and it's nice and it's pretty comfortable and there's not a lot of hardship that goes with that and yes it's very nice but i can see the other side of the barn and you can't and the other side of the barn is a slaughterhouse right right the chickens give eggs the cows give milk what do the pigs give the farmer do you really think he's pouring a bunch of blessings and prosperity on you because he likes you that much are you just his favorite if if society and everything's going so well and wonderful and the bleh you know oh i'm just doing so well and everything that i do just seems you know society just loves me what is this telling you do they really like you that much is is is this farm system this system designed to crush any manifestation of the seed of god inside of you does it really like you that much or does it have its own purpose for you right and napoleon says brother you're crazy i don't know what to tell you i just can't see it why would they like me this much right and besides i mean you're kind of high and mighty you're acting like you're the only christian here um you know i'm also a christian i go to church you know why why are you so much better well i had this this when i was i was putting my notes together for this um last night and i um i was i needed something to listen to i like to listen to music you know gospel music when i'm when i'm putting my notes together and stuff and um i had this it's an old you know gospel song i don't want to say what it is um and i i i wanted to listen to it and i didn't i just typed it into youtube right just to pull up some version of it to listen to and i type it in and just kind of click on the first result and not really look and tab out and go back to my notes and the music was pretty good you know it was pretty typical kind of a little bit of a sort of a contemporary vibe to it but whatever it wasn't egregious and you know it it is you know it was it was okay but for whatever reason i just got compelled hey click tap back over to that and watch the video and so i watched the video of the people performing this song and again the music wasn't crazy the people weren't dressed crazy it wasn't a bunch of pyrotechnics people didn't have purple mohawks it wasn't a christian rock band right but got really weirded out because the people on the stage are the way they're moving their bodies not sensual it wasn't like some sort of like sexy erotic thing it was a it was the sort of movement that i've seen before i wasn't always a good christian boy i went to a lot of rock concerts i've seen people move like that before and it happens in two places one when someone's completely cracked out on some sort of drug or two when they've completely given their body over to the devil at a rock concert that's the only time i've ever seen that and here are these people playing gospel music not in a particularly egregious way and moving their bodies in a way that i know is associated with satanic worship okay this is from satan's eden the god of this world today the worship person of this world today is satan and the people are ignorant of worshiping satan but it's satan impersonating himself as the church see as the church they worship satan thinking they are worshiping god through the church but it's but it's the way satan has done it okay you have people in this day who will worship satan they sing all the right words they raise their hands and say hallelujah they say praise the lord and the entire time they are not worshiping jehovah okay i don't care what comes out of their mouth i don't care how pleasant the words are i don't care how nice they are and how good morals they have they are worshiping satan why notice you say but wait a minute we preached the word look back here at my text tonight satan was the one that preached the word to eve first god hath said see people and by the way we will say we're in a message church we preach the word right we preach the word don't we so how you know what's it's that misconstruing that part of the scripture that applies to the day he'll tell he'll let you know all jesus did was perfectly well he'll let you know that moses did was all perfectly well but when you take the promises that they gave for this day then that was applied to another age that's the criteria for worshiping satan thinking you're worshiping god okay it is when people look at the promises of god right that's all he has to do see is to get the people to believe it that way and that's all you can't take one word away from it or add one word to it but that's what he does if he can get people even in message churches to say well that was for brother branham or that's for the ministers or that's for someone anyone other than me right then guess what i don't care how loud you hallelujah in church i don't care how long your skirts are how you know how sanctified your speech is on the job site it doesn't matter if you're if there's somewhere in your life where you're not taking god at his word if you're not living up to the seed that's in you right you have a seed inside of you and if you're sitting there going oh that's not for me we don't i mean we don't want to be fanatical after all you know you know i don't want to you know we don't want to look like some muddy old wild pig i mean goodness we have to live in a society in this you know slaughterhouse society you know we have to fit in with this we have to conform we can't we can't offend people who might want to slaughter us really you know i mean look all we we look at something like the holocaust right i think this is horrible and it is i mean you can't you can't look at some of the documentation the photographs the stories the written testimonies of like some of the the soldiers who who found those camps and you look at that and go this is i mean this is literally the it's some of the most horrific things you can think of and it's not just the holocaust they did something like this in the soviet union um i mean actually some of the most like the most horrible things i've ever seen didn't actually come out of the holocaust came out of out of russia um you know a lot of different places right no country has clean hands right if you think that oh we're americans and we're free from that oh be don't be so sure um everybody every nation has dirt on their hands because every nation is human and every nation has the potential to be evil right and we we look at these things and think how horrible it is and like wow those people just gave themselves over to the demonic spirits but don't forget that all the spirits that drove the people of the world the various tyrants of the world to slaughter people in mass in the most cruel and horrific ways you can think of those same spirits the same intellect that was that orchestrated the genocide is still around it's still here it didn't go away when hitler died it's still here and it's not targeting jews it's targeting you the devil isn't here to spoil the whipped cream for your strawberries okay the devil is here to kill you and harm your children okay this is what the devil's plans are and he's going to do it we think to ourselves oh it's a spiritual fight it's not real somehow because it's somehow in this ethereal realm and not in the flesh and blood where we can see it oh okay what do you call it exactly when a teenager overdoses right are they any less if they end up dying in a hospital bed because they couldn't get them hit with narcan fast enough are they any more or less dead than the kid who died in the holocaust right you know this system isn't just here to to ruin your day like it's not just here to to to make things inconvenient it's here to make things very convenient right up until the point they're not right because you know we'll continue our little story here napoleon he goes on he never leaves the farm and one day he goes to walk out of his little barn to go to his pig pen and eat his little corn feed the door's not open there ain't no way out every single day that he that every day of his life that gate was open and he could have walked out the door but instead he turned to turn and walk over to his trough and keep eating his carnal entertainment and feeding on all kinds of things that were not that were not in line with his seed the things do you really think the devil hasn't engineered facebook and twitter and youtube to not suppress your seed do you really think do you really think that farmer didn't engineer that pig feed to produce the sort of body and lifestyle in that pig that he wanted right didn't do you think he didn't make it so that that pig would be so addicted to that thing he would never turn and walk away that every day he got up he could just walk and stuff his face you know stuff his face full of more of it instead of walking away and going the other way and going to the the environment and the diet that god intended for him of course he didn't he engineered it specifically to where he wouldn't be able to drop it he would and so every day he goes and he stuffs his face until one day he walks tries to walk out the door and goes oh the barn door's closed you know and now i can't get out that every day that he could have walked out until he couldn't and then when he's sitting there and here's the farmer sharpening his knife and the chain hoy's going clink clink clink clink clink clink clank and a big old meat hook on the end of it he's going oh peter was right should have listened and the thing and oh he's gonna run around and they're gonna be weeping and wailing and all kinds of gnashing of teeth and wee wee wee wee all the way around the barn and too bad not getting out right you know the farmer's going calm down little pig what did you expect this was your choice you could have walked out anytime it's time to pay the piper little pig i gave you all kinds of of a fun and i put a roof over your head and i put all kinds of luxury in your life and now it's time to fulfill your purpose right and one day there's going to be a lot of people who wake up going oh no those crazy people were right that little man was right and it's time to fulfill our purpose and there's no way out of the barn now right now i said there's a story of two little pigs and i i know that that's that particular little thing is kind of like ah scary right we everybody like a lot of times i know you know when i'm sitting over there i get like almost like um you're not gonna really get a lot of people like like conversions don't real not strong ones don't happen from fear right when you scare the people half to death it's like yeah how long is that going to last really right i'm not here to scare you guys i'm not here to terrify you and think you know repent or perish though i mean you should repent or you will perish that is the truth however i want to say if i could don't think about napoleon let's tell the other side of that story right let's look at his story because his story was not one of when he's in the farm peter when he's in the farm he's not looking around seeing a slaughterhouse he sees fun and happiness and joy and luxury just like everyone else all he sees his motivation was not i'm running from destruction it was i'm running towards a fulfillment of a purpose within me right i am i am and he and he burst through that he he takes that first step of faith outside of that pig pen and he runs for that tree line as hard as he can go and it's liberating and it's wonderful and he's going freedom as he runs the whole way you know when he gets to the woods and it's really exhilarating and then it gets hard right because you realize oh yeah actually um life was kind of easy when all of society was sort of you know i wasn't going against the grain of society you know when this system designed to push me into a slaughterhouse i'm no longer going with that flow i'm now going against that float things get hard right your flesh doesn't like it too good the nights are a little bit cold when you're not adapted to the weather your body isn't is all hairless and built for a barn night you know cold rainy nights are kind of tough you know there ain't no there is no carnal entertainment trough to go feed out of you gotta go dig around in the dirt you know but you know his nose hurts you know pigs they have that snout which i kind of want to drop back to that cause i wanna you can come on yeah i mean when you look at the differences here that that wild pig he's got that that thick fur i mean that stuff is i know you always ever use like a boar brush boar brussel brush i know katie has she loves them but she might be the only one because an old-fashioned type of thing um but uh anyways i mean you can brush your hair with that those bristles i mean they're they're stiff they're thick they are um those pigs those wild boars their snout is like rock hard because they have to dig they will uproot trees to get it at the things that they eat right and that that farm pig when he first gets out in the woods life is tough at first it's hard his flesh has to sacrifice a lot right his his snout bleeds and gets all calloused and blistered from having to dig around but guess what he's now feeding on the diet that god intended him to feed on he's now feeding on what you know he's in the environment yeah it's not so easy it's not so luxurious but it's the environment that god intended to him to to be in and now excuse me first of all he's not he's no longer that he suddenly has a a deep happiness and a fulfillment within him because that thing down inside of him that was hungering for this kind of lifestyle is now satisfied and he's the temptation to turn around one night when no one's looking and run back and stick his head through the bars the fence you know eat some of that sweet corn it's there because his flesh likes it right his flesh likes it if it wasn't enticing to his flesh his ancestors never would have got caught on it in the first place right it's designed to do that but if he will stay in that environment if you'll stay in that environment and let that seed be fulfilled within him something crazy happens right that's why i chose pigs you know what happens and i just read this off of i didn't put it on the on the powerpoint but i read it from the department of the dnr for arkansas because it's one of those states where this is an actual issue what happens when a domesticated pig gets out in the woods right 90 days in 90 days or less it can be as short as 30 days that pretty pink farm pig will turn back into that wild boar in 30 to 90 days every one of those genes that god put inside of it that had been suppressed by that man-made laodicean farm system reactivate they all come back right he's no long like he's not this this runt this thing that can be kicked around that goes running from the big bad wolf he's this faith warrior monster who's got tusk sticking out of his mouth that'll rip monsters to pieces they grow this this hide on their across their shoulders that you can't cut with a knife it's like an armor right that hide is thick they're waterproof i mean these things are monsters and he doesn't go running wee wee from the big bad wolf the big bad wolf goes running from him right you know the farmer and all of his dogs can go chase him in the woods but it's the farmer and the dogs that are go running away right why because he's now in line with the seed that god intended to him to have back in eden he was this way in eden he wasn't some pink pink hairless weakling right he had dominion over his domain right you ever hear you know it's you he was something to be to be reckoned with and a real powerhouse and that's what he goes back to just by going back like by going he he gets back into his eating condition by feeding on the eden on the eden diet and the eating lifestyle living that eden lifestyle and his body will naturally change look when he goes back in the woods he doesn't walk out in the woods and go trying to push out his his fur you know he's not going give me tusks right he can sit there and strain and get blue in the face and get a hernia trying to trying to do this and it won't happen because it's not by his not by his straining and trying all he does is just stick to that that seed let the seed have dominion over his behavior and the body change was in him the whole time right it was there the whole time he didn't have to do anything other than follow the instructions of the seed follow that that word that god put inside of him and the body change was there the whole time right now this is a cnn headline um that i saw the other day the binging button in fact scientists can reverse aging in mice the goal is to do the same to humans or for humans now why is this how does this work right um oh that text is kind of small um you might not be able to read that um what time is it well i'll give you kind of a synopsis you don't have to read it so much um the overview is basically some scientists figured out that the way the aging process works there's certain there's certain things called epigenetics these are basically tags in your dna that turn genes on and off at certain times okay functionally speaking if you eat a bunch of sugar your pancreas says we need you know your pancreas is supposed to produce insulin so you can process that sugar and when that sugar enters your bloodstream it triggers hits an epigenetic tag in your pancreas cells and your pancreas that tag activates your insulin gene and your insulin gets produced and it deals with your sugar okay same thing happens that's how your body works with everything okay even aging your body knows that as you age there are certain genes that need to be turned off or on like if you're a little kid and you need to grow up into an adult there are genes that turn on so that you grow and then once you grow and hit you know however tall you're supposed to be those genes turn back off and you you know stop growing well this stuff happens for everything and um the scientists figured out we can go back through some you know woohoo science um we can go in and reactivate genes that deactivated in your youth and they did this with mice and what they did was they took a young mou an old mouse and they put um they activated the genes in his eyes because his eyes he'd basically gone blind from age right he got you know that that happens um and when they reactivated those genes for his eyes it turned his eyes back to a young mouse's eyes okay and so he makes some statements um so if we reverse aging these diseases should not happen we have the technology today to be able to go into your hundreds without worrying worrying about getting cancer in your 70s heart disease in your 80s and alzheimer's in your 90s sinclair told an audience at life itself a health and wellness event presented in partnership with partnership with cnn this is the world that is coming it's literally a question of when and for most of us it's going to happen in our lifetimes sinclair told the audience somehow the cells know the body can reset itself and they still know which genes should be on when they were young sinclair said we think we're tapping into an ancient regeneration system that some animals use when you cut off the limb of a salamander it regrows the limb the tail of a fish will the tail of a fish will grow back a finger of a mouse will grow back that discovery indicates that there is a backup copy of youthfulness information stormed in the body he added we believe we have found the master control switch a way to rewind the clock he added the body will then wake up remember how to behave remember how to regenerate and we'll be young again even if you're already old and have an illness science has discovered the rapture okay science has discovered what the system that god put in place since the foundation of the world that every human has within them the ability to regenerate back to their eden condition the genes are there it's not just some fairy tale the scientists are proving it you live in that eaten condition you live with that even eaten lifestyle you have a relationship with the tree of life and that tree of life will reactivate those genes and your body changes here the whole time okay i mean am i the only one who wants to jump up and down um i mean i think that's a pretty good place to end this you know musicians can come on back um you know think of that if you know when you're in every day when you're thinking to yourself how shall i live my life today right as my my dad always said if you're preaching it's all nice and wonderful to give people deep dark mysteries but if you can't tell them how it helps them put their pants on and go to work on monday morning you wasted their time okay so i'm telling you if i could help you put your pants on on monday and go to work right get understand that let your let your life be in line with that eaten condition because the eden condition was not that they lived in paradise it wasn't that they had no pain and sorrow that was part of it but that wasn't that was a symptom the actual eden condition is that they had a communion with the tree of life the actual eden condition was a relationship okay it wasn't it wasn't a um you know we get so caught up on the on the paradise we forget who made the paradise right you can live in an eaten condition now your physical body doesn't have to change for you to get back to that even condition because the you know that that veil was ripped in half one day that flaming sword that guarded the path back to eden is no longer there you can go back to that tree of life and have that relationship so every day when you wake up you ask yourself how will i have a relationship with god today how will i live my life today you know make those decisions as tempting as it may be remember that that seed that seed of god is expecting a certain kind of relationship it's a certain kind of lifestyle and you as long as you as you stay in line with that that is the secret to to the to fulfilling the uh you allow that seed to have dominion in your life and not squash it with the things of the world not let the carnal things get in your way right not let anything come between you and christ because the moment you do you're gonna be back on the farm you know so that's we'll we'll have a have a all stand and sing a song we have a do we have a song it is no secret what god can do is give me a key see is no secret [Applause] what god can do [Music] he'll do for you [Music] [Music] you [Music] what god [Music] what god can do he'll do for you oh [Music] is [Music] [Applause] [Music] my mind aren't you glad for that [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] yes [Music] [Applause] [Music] wow amen hallelujah i remember years ago when i first started preaching i'd only been preaching probably three months and i preached my first sermon at happy valley big audience and brother donnie made a statement behind me i never forgot it and every once in a while i get to live it like tonight i got to live it brother donnie come up behind me and he said there's only two things that will make a preacher want a microphone somebody ahead of him who either can't preach or somebody ahead of him who really can and i really wanted the microphone tonight for the second reason i wish i would have said that i wish i had to preach that and i will amen just letting it over the mat praise the lord i'm glad that no minister has a copyright on the word of god it came from the mind of god did you enjoy that tonight i i would start going down my notes but i just i i i was blown away by some of that stuff that was that was a bit of all right and i you know at the end there especially well listen to me i say at the end but you can see all my red in between the black where the these are me taking off on my own sermons in between his notes amen so i do that but um you know it's always been curious to me and i've talked about this with a number of brothers over the years how that when brother branham saw those seven visions and those visions represented everything that would happen all the way up to the annihilation of the united states which the bride doesn't see she's already in glory so you can see that there were visions that he showed him about what would happen in politics and nazism and fascism communism he showed him visions about what would happen to the to the social fabric to the morality of the people and the fall of women showed him all of those social issues and then he came and showed him uh a realm of science and was showing and the last thing that brother branham saw that science would accomplish before the last vision which was the seventh one was the pilotless car a vehicle driving down super highways with no steering wheel in it and we have that and it's moving and migrating toward mass production and mass mass usage and we are already living in the last i know they talk about you know building a colony on the moon and going to mars but god didn't show the brother branham any of that they've got a way now that science has discovered how that they can suddenly they've got you said science and has the rapture amen but you know but now my mind was thinking i thought to myself they'll never make it because the last thing that science would ever achieve that would be big now there's lots of things science would achieve that brother m didn't see but the last big item was driverless cars and we're here and i thought to myself tonight and i jotted this down in my note and this is going to be a brainstorm for me to go the next couple days and think about if you call me and i sound distracted this is why and because i know that god chased adam and eve out of the garden of eden lest they partake of the tree of life and live forever in a fallen state so they could have broken into eternal life but it would have been perverted thing you see god stopped them at the tower of babel after testifying this they've begun to do and now nothing can be restrained even whatsoever they've imagined and brother branham says they were trying to break back into heaven and apparently when i read the scripture god is saying i'm going to have to stop this i'm gonna have to interrupt this program or they're gonna make it and now here they're saying we can produce what the rapture can produce i'm here to tell you they're not going to make it because god's going to stop the process because we are already ready for a rapture amen and even if they accomplished it i thought to myself even see because if they accomplished it it would be it would be a perversion it would be a perverted result if adam and eve had done that it would have been a perverted result had they had they broke back into heaven and eternal life it would have produced a perverted result and what they're showing in science every time because it's true of knowledge good and evil will produce a perverted result does that sound crazy to you i mean that that's that is that is such way out there thinking and i wouldn't even be thinking like that except here are the leading scientists of the world saying it's going to happen in in your lifetime i'm here to tell you something friends the rapture is happening in your lifetime is me and matt the only ones who want to run and jump oh hallelujah friends uh the day look up your redemption draweth not amen wow say it backwards wow oh my oh i just i can't even go on i'll just i'll keep preaching all night long we're going to take up a couple of prayer requests the only uh two that i that i got for tonight and other than brother brad we wanted to remember um your friend is named carl uh it's carl rebecca's friend yeah okay it's okay and uh he is uh he's facing open hearts okay and then the situation with the old house yeah all right so we we've got to remember brother brad and sister rebecca and i mean i get i get what the what the owners are doing hey it's it's business uh but uh but brother brad says rebecca are facing a real life problem so call it what you want but this is a real crisis for them so let's pray god will give them another place right away there's so many of us in here that can testify that god has done that so many times amen so let's believe that he'll do it for them also this man carl that sister rebecca works with also we've got a request in online please keep sister peggy whitehead from georgia in prayer she and several family members have coveted they've come down with cover they're asking for prayer that came in over the internet now but the jack writes and he says i got a prayer request he's been witnessing to a man it happens to be his name as jason was going to meet him to dig a pond and he and his wife have coveted so they caught covet as well and and i told him we would have prayer for them and and i felt impressed to tell him what god done in our age you don't have to give brother jack but a slight little open door he's like brother rodney or sister gene you better get ready to hear a sermon amen and so so he says i felt impressed to tell him what god has done in our age he told me his wife and daughter was going to be baptized so that opened the door for me to tell him the right way to be baptized praise our lord i love telling people the real word amen so so brother jack is asking for prayer amen let's believe that brother jack will rescue these people from a false baptism and teach them the right way to be baptized amen that's the only request that i saw if one came in uh and i missed it um okay that's not one uh so i apologize to you you should always try to get them to me uh early i appreciate the people who do and i i try to get them immediately
