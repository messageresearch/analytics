[43:27] isn't it amen let's get right into the
[43:30] word uh turn in your Bibles to Genesis
[43:32] the 32nd chapter um you might hear a few
[43:36] familiar things tonight if you heard my
[43:37] Sunday school a few weeks ago but it's
[43:40] mostly all new material so it's all
[43:42] right amen the Lord sometimes does that
[43:43] when I'm studying he'll reignite my
[43:45] heart on something he gave me for a
[43:47] Sunday school and maybe change some
[43:49] things and uh make it a little bit more
[43:51] preach amen hope that's all right we
[43:53] have two scriptures we'll be reading
[43:54] from uh Genesis 32 and then Ephesians
[43:57] chapter 1 so we're going to start at
[43:58] verse one in Genesis
[44:01] 32 familiar story and Jacob went on his
[44:04] way and the angels of God met him and
[44:06] when Jacob saw them he said this is
[44:08] God's host and he called the name of
[44:11] that place mahanahan and Jacob sent his
[44:14] Messengers before him to Esau his
[44:16] brother unto the land of seir the
[44:17] country of Edom and he commanded them
[44:20] saying thus shall ye speak unto the Lord
[44:22] Esau thy servant Jacob has saith thus I
[44:26] have sojourned with laan
[44:27] stayed there until now and I have oxen
[44:29] and asses flocks and men's servants
[44:31] women servants and I have sent to tell
[44:33] the Lord what I may find Grace in thy
[44:35] sight and The Messengers returned to
[44:38] Jacob saying we came to thy brother Esau
[44:40] and also he cometh to meet thee and 400
[44:43] men with him then Jacob was greatly
[44:45] afraid and distressed and he divided the
[44:46] people that was with him in the flocks
[44:48] and the herds and the camels into two
[44:49] bonds bands and said if Esau come to one
[44:53] company and smite it then the other
[44:55] company which is left shall Escape and
[44:57] Jacob said oh god of My Father Abraham
[45:00] and God of my father Isaac the Lord
[45:02] which Sayes unto me return under thy
[45:05] country and to thy Kindred and I will
[45:07] deal well with thee I am not worthy of
[45:09] the least of all thy mercies and of all
[45:10] the truth which thou has showed unto thy
[45:12] servant for with my staff I passed over
[45:15] this Jordan and now I have become two
[45:17] bands deliver me I pray thee from the
[45:19] hand of my brother from the hand of Esau
[45:22] for I fear Him lest he will come and
[45:24] smite me and the mother with the
[45:26] children and and thou set I will surely
[45:28] do thee good and make thy seed as the
[45:31] sand of the sea which cannot be numbered
[45:33] and let's move down to verse 22 he says
[45:36] and he rose up that night and he took
[45:38] his two wives and his two women servants
[45:40] and his 11 sons and passed over the four
[45:42] jaac and he took them and sent them over
[45:45] the brook and sent them all that he had
[45:48] and Jacob was left alone that's an
[45:50] important scripture and there Wrestled a
[45:52] man with him until the breaking of the
[45:54] day and when he saw that he prevailed
[45:56] not against him he touched the hollow of
[45:57] his thigh and the hollow of Jacob's
[45:59] thigh was out of joint as he wrestled
[46:01] with him and he said let me go for the
[46:03] day breth and he said I will not let
[46:05] thee go except thou bless me and he said
[46:07] unto them what is thy name he said Jacob
[46:11] and he said thy name shall no more be
[46:13] called Jacob but Israel for as a prince
[46:16] hast thou power with God and with men
[46:18] and Hast prevailed and Jacob asked him
[46:21] and said tell me I pray thee thy name
[46:23] and he said wherefore is it that thou
[46:25] Dost ask after my my name and he blessed
[46:28] him there and Jacob called the name of
[46:30] that place pineal for I have seen God
[46:33] face to face and my life is preserved
[46:36] amen let's move over to Ephesians the
[46:38] first
[46:40] chapter Ephesians chapter 1 and we're
[46:42] going to start at verse three amen give
[46:45] you a moment to turn there Ephesians 1
[46:47] and verse three it says blessed be the
[46:50] God and father of our Lord Jesus
[46:53] Christ Heavenly in Christ according as
[46:57] he hath chosen Us in him before the
[47:00] foundation of the world that we should
[47:03] be holy and Without Blame before him in
[47:05] love having predestinated us unto the
[47:09] adoption of children by Jesus Christ
[47:12] himself according to the good pleasure
[47:14] of his will to the praise of the glory
[47:17] of his grace wherein he hath made us
[47:19] accepted in the Beloved in whom we have
[47:22] Redemption through his blood the
[47:23] Forgiveness of sins according to the
[47:26] riches of his Gra
[47:27] wherein he hath abounded toward us in
[47:29] all wisdom and Prudence having made
[47:32] known unto us the mystery of his will
[47:35] according to his good pleasure which he
[47:38] hath purposed in himself aren't you glad
[47:40] for that that in the dispensation of the
[47:42] fullness of times he might gather
[47:44] together in one all things in Christ
[47:46] both which are in heaven and which are
[47:48] in Earth even in him in whom we have
[47:51] obtained an inheritance an inheritance
[47:54] being predestinated according to the
[47:56] purpose of him who worketh all things
[47:58] after the counsel of his own will that
[48:00] we should be to the praise of his glory
[48:02] who first trusted in Christ in whom ye
[48:04] also trusted after that you heard the
[48:06] word of Truth The Gospel of your
[48:08] salvation in whom also after that you
[48:10] believed you were sealed with the Holy
[48:12] Spirit of Promise that's an important
[48:14] one which is the earnest of our
[48:16] inheritance until the Redemption of our
[48:18] purchased possession under the praise of
[48:21] his glory amen let's just bow our bow
[48:24] our heads this this evening Heavenly
[48:26] Father Lord God we just come before your
[48:28] throne this evening Lord father there's
[48:31] nothing that I could say Lord Jesus that
[48:33] would help a single person but Lord
[48:35] You're Here father and we know that Lord
[48:37] when you're here Lord it it makes
[48:40] everything all right Lord I just pray
[48:42] that you could minister to our hearts
[48:43] father God set me aside Lord Jesus help
[48:46] me be a conduit for the people to Lord
[48:48] receive your word from Lord God anoint
[48:50] my lips Lord anoint your text Lord
[48:52] father just anoint everything in this
[48:54] service tonight Lord may it all be for
[48:56] the glory and for the honor of of you
[48:58] Lord Jesus we love you now and we commit
[49:00] it all to you in Jesus name amen God
[49:03] bless you tonight um I'm taking a title
[49:06] tonight of the unconditional thanks bro
[49:09] the unconditional Covenant and I'd like
[49:11] to uh sub if I could subtitle it insight
[49:14] to Victory insight to
[49:17] Victory my heart has been fixed these
[49:20] past several weeks on the grace of God
[49:23] through Jacob's life amen Jacob was a
[49:25] man that was absolutely ordained in the
[49:29] scriptures to carry out something
[49:31] important in God's plan amen we all can
[49:33] agree with that but there are so many
[49:35] instances in his life where he fell so
[49:37] short anden brother brandom says this in
[49:40] the identified masterpieces of God 1964
[49:42] he says we got one we must keep in
[49:45] harmony with that's God and in the
[49:47] beginning was the word and the Word was
[49:49] with God and the Word was God and the
[49:51] word remains God and always will be God
[49:54] because God is in his word
[49:57] and the Word was made flesh and dwelt
[49:59] Among Us in the person of the Son of God
[50:02] now we find that after he found this
[50:04] great marring it looked like had been
[50:07] you and
[50:08] I and we'd put all the time and effort
[50:10] we'd kick the thing over and just let it
[50:12] go but not God he was not willing to let
[50:16] that thing go to ruin aren't you glad
[50:18] for that that's the love of God aren't
[50:20] you glad for that no wonder the poet
[50:22] says brother brandom says would we with
[50:24] ink the ocean fill and were the Skies of
[50:27] parchment made and every stalk on earth
[50:29] a quill and every man ascribed by trade
[50:33] right the love of God would drain the
[50:35] ocean dry or could the scroll contain
[50:38] the hole though stretched from Sky to
[50:40] Sky see it's the love of God the prophet
[50:43] said after man had fallen and
[50:46] deliberately opened the door to the
[50:49] enemy and come in and marred him and set
[50:52] death in him still God was not willing
[50:56] willing this be defeated he came down he
[51:00] started all over again he was going to
[51:02] make that man again I want you to notice
[51:03] this brother bom says he put Adam on a
[51:05] covenant do this and not this this not
[51:09] that touch not handle not taste not but
[51:11] we find out when he started again he
[51:13] started with Abraham and in Abraham he
[51:17] started him on an
[51:19] unconditional Covenant Hallelujah now
[51:22] not if you will but I have I've already
[51:26] done it I've blessed you and your seed
[51:29] and so forth after you it was an
[51:32] unconditional Covenant then we find out
[51:36] that he based on Abraham and give him
[51:38] the Covenant unconditional the promise
[51:40] it was it was an unconditional guarantee
[51:43] not if you will but I've already done it
[51:46] thanks be to God he's already done the
[51:48] work so that means that he just has to
[51:51] mold our lives so that he he can get us
[51:55] to perfectly agree with the work that
[51:57] he's already done amen hallelujah that's
[52:00] why you can get down into Jacob's life
[52:03] where we read and you can see his human
[52:05] nature and you can see how he kept he
[52:08] was failing and and he and he lied and
[52:10] he was a Shyer and and he had fear rule
[52:12] over his life even in this chapter but
[52:14] God had a plan all along Amen to bring
[52:18] him into complete submission it was an
[52:21] unconditional promise there was nothing
[52:23] that Jacob could do to not be a part of
[52:26] that Covenant because it was
[52:28] unconditional Hallelujah I'm so thankful
[52:30] for that then he came brother Benham
[52:32] says to the Patriarchs we come next in
[52:34] the Old Testament as we get down here he
[52:36] displayed the foundation of the work now
[52:39] we're going to go through some things in
[52:40] Isaac's life we're going to go through
[52:41] some things in Jacob's life those are
[52:43] the four Patriarchs Abraham Isaac Jacob
[52:46] Joseph amen and now Abraham represented
[52:49] faith we know that brother bam says
[52:50] because Abraham was Faith he was the
[52:52] great faith because he staggered not at
[52:54] the promise of God through unbelief you
[52:56] know when he when we'd say the chips is
[52:58] down and everything's against us he
[53:00] still held on to God then we have Isaac
[53:03] he says which was beloved Son which
[53:06] represents love because Abraham being a
[53:08] type of God as Isaac was offered Genesis
[53:11] 22 we find out that he carried the wood
[53:13] up the hill and everything portrayed
[53:14] Christ foreshadowed him and then the ram
[53:17] came and was offered in instead and now
[53:19] that was Faith love and a little bit
[53:21] further down the prophet says now Jacob
[53:23] which means supplanter and that's
[53:25] Deceiver and we realize that Jacob's
[53:28] life really represents Grace because it
[53:32] was the grace of God all the time with
[53:35] Jacob amen you know and I made this
[53:37] point in in the Sunday School a few
[53:38] weeks ago and it so struck me people
[53:40] have experiences with God all the time
[53:44] in their life all throughout their life
[53:45] and I honestly believe that they are
[53:47] real and true encounters with God you
[53:50] can look at Jacob's life you know God
[53:52] came to him several times supernaturally
[53:55] at bethl he gave him a vision of angels
[53:57] descending and ascending into heaven and
[54:00] and God spoke to him he said Jacob I'm
[54:02] with you and and I'll be with you and
[54:04] I'll keep you and I won't leave you and
[54:06] and your descendants will be like the
[54:07] dust of the earth Jacob was even
[54:10] reminding him of that promise when he
[54:11] was when in the scripture we read and
[54:13] what more could someone need than an
[54:16] experience like that amen God coming
[54:19] supernaturally in a vision and telling
[54:21] you these words but see it wasn't what
[54:24] God had ordained for him yet it wasn't
[54:27] enough because Jacob hadn't yet fully
[54:30] surrendered himself to God's perfect
[54:33] will in his life amen he hadn't come
[54:36] face to face with God yet and it hadn't
[54:40] caused him to walk differently amen but
[54:43] you see it was all the time the workings
[54:45] of Grace in his life I love this
[54:49] scripture it was really it's part of
[54:50] really the core of my of my thought
[54:52] tonight Galatians 3:26 for ye are all
[54:55] the children of God by faith in Christ
[54:57] Jesus for as many of you has been
[54:59] baptized into Christ have put on Christ
[55:03] there is neither Jew nor Greek there is
[55:05] neither Bond nor free there is neither
[55:08] female nor male male nor female for ye
[55:10] are all one in Christ Jesus and if ye be
[55:13] Christ then ye are Abraham's seed and
[55:17] hes according to the promise see so
[55:20] those that have been baptized into
[55:22] Christ spiritually baptized and died to
[55:25] the things of the world are heirs
[55:28] according to the promise the
[55:29] unconditional Covenant promise that God
[55:32] made to Abraham hallelujah amen Jacob
[55:35] you know he had workings of Grace in and
[55:38] throughout his life you know and God was
[55:40] really with him at all those points in
[55:42] his life you know when when we see there
[55:45] you know he was at bethl and then he was
[55:48] with with his father-in-law laan for
[55:50] those 14 years and then when he ran from
[55:52] laan we see all these instances where
[55:54] God is with Jacob but you see there's a
[55:57] real difference and I want you to notice
[55:58] this tonight there's a real difference
[56:00] between experiences with Christ and
[56:04] having an experience that changes your
[56:07] nature amen that's why the prophet
[56:09] teaches us in this Muran Church age he
[56:11] says away with experiences but he
[56:14] doesn't say it doesn't stop there he
[56:16] says away with experiences as your
[56:19] measuring line amen so in other words
[56:22] experiences are important even the
[56:24] experiences that you have before you're
[56:26] born again of the spirit of God are
[56:28] still important otherwise God would not
[56:30] have written about those experiences
[56:32] that happened in Jacob's life those
[56:34] experiences that happened in Peter's
[56:36] life before Pentecost those things are
[56:38] important but until you get baptized
[56:40] into the spirit of Christ then you need
[56:43] to have a face-to-face experience with
[56:45] him
[56:47] Hallelujah in that sermon brother Eno
[56:50] said the whole of our problem there in
[56:52] the church age book is that people
[56:54] repent of our of their sin that's
[56:57] important amen you baptize and they
[56:59] baptize in Repentance but then they
[57:01] never go and receive the Holy Ghost sure
[57:05] you know Jacob had experiences of God
[57:08] but none of them had been enough to
[57:11] affect a real change in his life amen
[57:15] until you have an experience that allows
[57:17] you to match up with this word then you
[57:19] have not come face to face with God in
[57:23] your life amen you know they experien
[57:26] that Peno was one that God could could
[57:29] finally break him of his own will amen I
[57:32] want God to break me of my own will I
[57:34] know I've got the Holy Ghost but I still
[57:36] got some of my own will that grips me
[57:38] and I want him to break me of it amen
[57:40] who's with me tonight I want to I want
[57:42] to be broken Lord I want to I want you
[57:44] to lead and guide every aspect of my
[57:48] life glory to God you look back on
[57:51] things that God does in your life and
[57:54] you know you you you and as as a
[57:57] Christian you know that it was Christ it
[57:59] was the grace of God working in your
[58:01] life you you know it even before you had
[58:03] an experienced you you know wow like you
[58:05] think back on that that had to be God
[58:07] that saved me from that situation or
[58:09] that changed this there because he has
[58:11] ordained you amen there is a seed placed
[58:14] on the inside of you that a specific
[58:16] point in time there's going to shine a
[58:19] light amen the light of the word and
[58:21] it's going to bring it to life amen and
[58:23] then you're going to have Hallelujah
[58:25] that if face to- face experience God is
[58:28] a patient God because he works outside
[58:31] of the realm of time amen sometimes
[58:33] we're impatient because we work in time
[58:36] but God works outside of time he sees
[58:38] the finished product thanks be to
[58:41] God glory to
[58:44] God he has a greater plan for then than
[58:48] for you to stay the way that you are
[58:52] amen then to let that old nature rule
[58:54] you like they like Jacob did or like
[58:56] Peter did he
[58:59] he he's you to something greater he has
[59:04] ordained you to not live in defeat every
[59:07] day as a Christian he has ordained you
[59:10] to live a Victorious Life in Jesus
[59:12] Christ I know many times we have Falls
[59:14] and failures and things that happen in
[59:16] our life but God has ordained you to be
[59:19] victorious in this day brother B would
[59:21] say that that when the time comes it
[59:24] would be so close to Christ CU why we're
[59:26] we're in the word we're we're constantly
[59:28] just oh we're constantly repenting
[59:30] because we want to be right with God all
[59:32] the time amen we we want to make sure
[59:34] that we're living in his perfect
[59:36] will glory to
[59:38] God you know I was I was studying for
[59:40] this last night and brother the Lord
[59:44] just placed on my heart to put this in
[59:46] here from the church age book it's in
[59:48] that sman church age brother Ram says it
[59:50] is not the person that comes
[59:53] predestinated it is not the person that
[59:55] comes pred destinated eternally from God
[59:57] now watch this it is the word or seed
[1:00:01] that is it way back there to far back
[1:00:05] from the human mind to grasp the Eternal
[1:00:08] god with eternal thoughts thought and
[1:00:11] decreed Jacob have I loved but Esau have
[1:00:14] I
[1:00:15] hated in Romans 9:13 and neither was
[1:00:19] born and neither had done good or evil
[1:00:22] see it was the thought and then that
[1:00:24] thought became expressed
[1:00:26] and God brought bought back Jacob
[1:00:29] because Jacob alone was seed amen Jacob
[1:00:33] alone had the seed and that is why he
[1:00:36] had respect to the birthright and the
[1:00:39] Covenant of God Amen you read that story
[1:00:42] with Jacob and Esau and you wonder it's
[1:00:44] because Jacob there was something inside
[1:00:47] Jacob that his whole life his whole life
[1:00:50] even before he had that experience there
[1:00:51] was something inside I want that birth
[1:00:53] right glory to God and he says he says
[1:00:57] if you are true seed then you will hear
[1:01:00] the word the spirit will baptize you
[1:01:03] into the body of Christ filling you and
[1:01:06] empowering you and you will receive the
[1:01:08] word for your day and age Hallelujah you
[1:01:11] see how clear the true evidence becomes
[1:01:14] when the word is revealed to you you
[1:01:16] know he says again not Jesus was the
[1:01:18] royal seed he lived in a human body and
[1:01:20] when the spirit called to him the
[1:01:22] manifested the word manifested thought
[1:01:24] he went to the Jordan and was there
[1:01:27] baptized in water amen he went down to
[1:01:30] the water amen upon obeying the word the
[1:01:33] Holy Spirit came upon him and the voice
[1:01:35] said this is my beloved Son hear ye him
[1:01:38] the voice did not say this has become
[1:01:41] the son Jesus was the son the Holy Ghost
[1:01:45] positioned him as the son before them
[1:01:48] all then having been filled thus and the
[1:01:51] patterns the same pattern holds at
[1:01:53] Pentecost and after he went in
[1:01:55] demonstrated power receiving the full
[1:01:57] revelation of God and from God for that
[1:02:00] day amen I have no doubt in my life that
[1:02:03] in my and I have no doubt that many
[1:02:06] people in their lives have encounters
[1:02:09] with God genuine experiences with God I
[1:02:13] have no doubt about that but the
[1:02:15] dividing line is whether your life
[1:02:18] matches the word after you've had that
[1:02:21] experience it is absolutely pivotal that
[1:02:24] you look if my life does not match up
[1:02:27] with the word then I need to have
[1:02:29] another experience and this time this
[1:02:31] experience needs to match the word
[1:02:35] hallelujah did you go back to your old
[1:02:38] ways after you had that experience
[1:02:40] that's the problem brother bam said is
[1:02:41] that they had this experience and they
[1:02:42] repented all their sins and that's good
[1:02:44] for the past but now you need something
[1:02:46] for the future that's why you get the
[1:02:48] Holy Ghost baptized into your soul
[1:02:50] because then you can walk with Christ
[1:02:52] daily
[1:02:54] Hallelujah glory to to
[1:02:57] God you
[1:02:59] know Jacob could say before pineal that
[1:03:03] I am I am bloodline I'm C Gene of
[1:03:05] Abraham amen you know I'd have no doubt
[1:03:08] that he probably met his grandfather
[1:03:11] Abraham and he watched the working of
[1:03:13] God through his life and and through his
[1:03:15] his father's life Isaac and and and
[1:03:17] Rebecca no doubt that Isaac and Rebecca
[1:03:20] would probably love that story would
[1:03:22] probably tell their love story of how
[1:03:24] God supernaturally brought them together
[1:03:27] amen I I love that story you know
[1:03:29] growing up I I just I just imagine that
[1:03:33] Rebecca would tell Jacob the story how
[1:03:35] it was one day like any other day that
[1:03:38] Rebecca was down by the well tending to
[1:03:40] her family's business when a man came
[1:03:43] down by the well and this man had camels
[1:03:45] and and there was something about this
[1:03:47] man as he as he walked up maybe maybe
[1:03:49] she could sense that he was a follower
[1:03:51] of maybe the same Jehovah or you know
[1:03:54] but how Rebecca felt felt so compelled
[1:03:57] to go above and beyond what he had asked
[1:04:01] of her amen the prayer that elaser had
[1:04:04] prayed was not only will you let her
[1:04:07] give me water but will you let her give
[1:04:09] my camels water and something deep down
[1:04:12] all that deep calls and it responds
[1:04:15] something deep down says I want to give
[1:04:17] more I want to feed your camels too
[1:04:20] Hallelujah Rebecca was being water
[1:04:23] tested that day Hallelujah what was
[1:04:26] going to be her
[1:04:28] reaction amen something about being at
[1:04:31] the well that day was different because
[1:04:34] God had orchestrated a servant of
[1:04:36] Abraham to go and look for a bride for
[1:04:40] his son Hallelujah and it was going to
[1:04:42] be based on her reaction on her response
[1:04:47] that the servant that day would know
[1:04:49] that this is the
[1:04:51] one because eler himself was a servant
[1:04:54] he knew the he knew the heart of a
[1:04:55] servant he knew what the character of a
[1:04:57] servant's heart looked like and he
[1:04:59] prayed that prayer and he asked God let
[1:05:02] it come to pass amen he knew this is the
[1:05:04] one to whom my master was seeking amen
[1:05:09] you know it reminded me of the story
[1:05:11] there in judges when Gideon was in
[1:05:14] preparation for that great battle you
[1:05:16] know if familiar with the story God had
[1:05:18] prepared this Mighty Man of Valor to to
[1:05:21] take on an army and to defeat the
[1:05:23] midianites amen but God had kept
[1:05:25] dwindling down that Army amen we he
[1:05:27] started with north of 32,000 men but God
[1:05:31] had kept making that number smaller and
[1:05:34] smaller amen and finally God told Gideon
[1:05:38] he said take them down to the water this
[1:05:41] is how I will choose the ones that will
[1:05:44] stand and fight for me in the battle
[1:05:47] amen he was going to water test those
[1:05:50] soldiers and it would be based on their
[1:05:53] reaction to the water it was going to be
[1:05:56] how they conducted themselves around the
[1:05:59] water that God would choose who would
[1:06:02] stand and fight with Gideon I want you
[1:06:04] to catch that tonight I know it's a
[1:06:05] simple thing but catch that it would be
[1:06:08] based on the reaction to the water how
[1:06:10] they conducted themselves and friends
[1:06:13] tonight how you conduct yourself around
[1:06:16] the water of the word is so vital these
[1:06:19] things are types they happen in the word
[1:06:21] and when he comes to the the water in
[1:06:23] the scriptures types the words the
[1:06:25] Waters of life and how you react to the
[1:06:28] Waters of life when it's ministered to
[1:06:30] you even when it's hard even when it's a
[1:06:32] correction even when you need to change
[1:06:34] your life how you react is important
[1:06:37] because it shows what's on the inside of
[1:06:40] the inside amen hallelujah the Bible
[1:06:43] says straight is the gate straight isn't
[1:06:45] like a line straight is a narrow passage
[1:06:47] of water water is the gate amen water is
[1:06:51] the gate to the to the Waters of Life
[1:06:53] Hallelujah
[1:06:55] you know he's looking for men and women
[1:06:58] to be water
[1:07:00] tested not a manufactured thing you know
[1:07:04] Rebecca's actions at the well that day
[1:07:07] just reflected something that was
[1:07:08] already down in her heart down in her
[1:07:11] soul
[1:07:12] amen I love that scripture it judges 74
[1:07:16] but the Lord said to Gideon the people
[1:07:18] are still too many bring them down to
[1:07:21] the water and I will test them for you
[1:07:23] there then it will be that of of whom I
[1:07:26] say to you this one shall go the same
[1:07:28] shall go with you and of whomever I say
[1:07:31] to you this one shall not go the same
[1:07:33] shall not go so he told Gideon part of
[1:07:36] his plan but he said I'm going to be the
[1:07:38] one that tests them so all Gideon had
[1:07:42] all his instructions were were go and
[1:07:44] complete this task and he did what God
[1:07:47] Said but he had no idea how how they
[1:07:49] were going to lap the water or how they
[1:07:51] were going to drink he had no idea
[1:07:52] exactly what was going to take place and
[1:07:54] God didn't tell tell him which ones or
[1:07:57] which way or or any of the fine details
[1:08:00] amen he just said I will test them and
[1:08:02] whomever I say and I and I can just
[1:08:05] think because I'm human like Gideon was
[1:08:06] that maybe he saw the majority it was
[1:08:08] 9700 and he saw man that's that's going
[1:08:10] to be my battle he must have wanted to
[1:08:12] send those 300 he he must they must have
[1:08:14] had something in their life that that
[1:08:15] just wasn't ready but no God picked
[1:08:18] those 300 men amen from 10,000 soldiers
[1:08:22] that went down to the water that day 97
[1:08:25] of 100 of them did not go to
[1:08:29] battle thans God's ways are higher than
[1:08:32] our ways you know he he knows what's
[1:08:34] going on in the inward parts of our
[1:08:36] hearts and the inward parts of our souls
[1:08:39] he you know those 300 men had conducted
[1:08:41] themselves a certain way they partook of
[1:08:44] it a certain way you know may not have
[1:08:46] it may not have been the way that that
[1:08:47] Gideon would have thought you know it
[1:08:49] may it may it may not been the the way
[1:08:51] that we would think today you know but
[1:08:55] maybe maybe I just had I don't have any
[1:08:57] quotes on this this is this brother
[1:08:58] Caleb maybe they maybe the majority you
[1:09:00] know knelt down their knee in a certain
[1:09:02] way I don't know why that they did it
[1:09:03] the way that they did but God obviously
[1:09:06] saw something in the way that they
[1:09:08] responded to the water and he sees the
[1:09:11] way that you respond to the water of the
[1:09:15] word he sees your reaction to what's
[1:09:18] being ministered he sees your reaction
[1:09:20] to when you read the scriptures he sees
[1:09:22] the thoughts that go through your mind
[1:09:24] the thoughts in the tense of your heart
[1:09:26] amen he knows those inward parts of you
[1:09:29] amen he
[1:09:32] knows you know and you know God he's
[1:09:35] looking for his bride like little
[1:09:37] Rebecca there at the well to display
[1:09:39] their true nature you know if you go
[1:09:41] back and you read about Rebecca her
[1:09:44] family put the decision into her hands
[1:09:49] and something had risen in her heart and
[1:09:51] I believe it was some faith that God had
[1:09:53] placed there to know that this was
[1:09:55] something important I need to go with
[1:09:57] this messenger I need to go now I can't
[1:10:00] wait you know because you read down even
[1:10:04] just a few days you know the the eler
[1:10:07] came I know we're all familiar with the
[1:10:08] story but Bible stories are amazing amen
[1:10:11] glory to God she watched eler deliver
[1:10:13] the message from the master and there
[1:10:15] was something so real about it there was
[1:10:19] something so genuine he he he told he
[1:10:22] told her family about how my master and
[1:10:26] and his son and how he has all these
[1:10:28] things prepared and how you're going to
[1:10:29] be his bride and how you just need to
[1:10:31] come with me and and and and and he was
[1:10:34] a trusted servant amen you know and and
[1:10:37] elaser he didn't waste any time he came
[1:10:40] to find a wife for his master's
[1:10:42] son and by faith Rebecca walked into the
[1:10:47] love of her life amen I want
[1:10:51] to Beth answered and said the thing
[1:10:54] proceedeth from the Lord Lord we cannot
[1:10:56] speak unto thee good or bad behold
[1:10:58] Rebecca is before thee take her and let
[1:11:00] her go and be thy Master's son's wife
[1:11:04] and um I'm just going to skip down
[1:11:07] verses 54 and they did eat and drink he
[1:11:09] and the men that were with him and
[1:11:10] carried all night and they rose up in
[1:11:12] the morning and he said send me away to
[1:11:14] thy master and her brother and her
[1:11:16] mother said let the damsel abide with us
[1:11:18] a few days at the least 10 after that
[1:11:21] she shall go and he said unto them
[1:11:23] hinder me not seeing that the Lord had
[1:11:26] prospered my way send me away that I may
[1:11:28] go to my master catch this let the
[1:11:31] damsel abide just a few days it seems
[1:11:35] like a pretty fair request amen he he's
[1:11:38] about to take the Beloved daughter of
[1:11:40] this family obviously she she did a lot
[1:11:43] for this family if she was down by the
[1:11:45] by the the well that day she was a hard
[1:11:47] worker in the family they were they were
[1:11:50] loved anybody loves their daughter you
[1:11:52] know you don't want their you don't want
[1:11:53] her leave amen so it seemed like a
[1:11:55] pretty fair request am mean all of this
[1:11:57] had happened so quickly but you see the
[1:12:00] bridegroom was waiting amen and the
[1:12:04] supper was prepared and the servant knew
[1:12:07] that that this this she can't stay even
[1:12:10] if it's just a slight chance that she'll
[1:12:13] somehow change her mind she needs to
[1:12:15] come back with me now amen something
[1:12:17] maybe maybe he thought in his mind
[1:12:19] something may happen to her on the
[1:12:20] journey I don't know I need to have her
[1:12:22] with me when I'm when I meet my master
[1:12:25] son am he had to make sure he completed
[1:12:28] that task he was convincing her to come
[1:12:32] I want you to notice this this struck my
[1:12:33] heart because that's why we preach the
[1:12:35] gospel amen that's what the messenger is
[1:12:39] sent to accomplish is to convince the
[1:12:41] bride to come but the problem with
[1:12:43] convincing someone to do something is
[1:12:46] the devil can convince you to do a lot
[1:12:48] of things amen he's the master of
[1:12:51] persuasion amen he he you know he he he
[1:12:54] he he's beening doing this a lot longer
[1:12:56] than any of us have and he knows how to
[1:12:58] trick our minds and he knows how to say
[1:13:00] well why don't we just say Abide a few
[1:13:02] more days how why don't we say Terry a
[1:13:04] little bit longer why don't we say let's
[1:13:06] wait a little bit longer I'm not fully
[1:13:07] ready to surrender this thing in my life
[1:13:10] I'm not fully ready to give this thing
[1:13:11] up because he's the master of deception
[1:13:15] he's the master he's the he has the art
[1:13:17] already he wrote the book amen so you
[1:13:20] know when God places something on your
[1:13:22] heart to do something you need to
[1:13:23] surrender that thing right then you need
[1:13:26] to let God come in and sweep out the
[1:13:28] house in your life
[1:13:31] Hallelujah that's what pastor does when
[1:13:33] he's up here that's what brother Matt
[1:13:34] these brothers do they come up here to
[1:13:36] convince you to come how did Rebecca
[1:13:39] know that this was
[1:13:41] right how how did she know there was
[1:13:44] something in her she had to take a step
[1:13:46] of Faith amen and we can do all the
[1:13:49] convincing we can do we can't give you
[1:13:51] anything I have nothing to offer you all
[1:13:55] I can do is tell you about one who has
[1:13:58] everything to offer all I can do I is
[1:14:01] Proclaim listen if you follow me if you
[1:14:05] listen to the words that I'm saying
[1:14:07] they're words of life and you're going
[1:14:08] to meet your bridegroom and there's
[1:14:10] going to be something there that that
[1:14:12] you've never had before I realize that
[1:14:15] you're going to have to leave back your
[1:14:16] family I realize that you're going to
[1:14:18] have to leave everything you've ever
[1:14:20] known Rebecca but if you come with me oh
[1:14:22] bride if you come with me oh oh I've got
[1:14:25] a message from a prophet that says that
[1:14:28] we're going home and this is the only
[1:14:31] way Hallelujah to be baptized amen
[1:14:35] hallelujah into the spirit of
[1:14:38] Christ
[1:14:41] hallelujah
[1:14:44] hallelujah elzer had nothing in himself
[1:14:47] to offer her but he could bring her to
[1:14:51] someone that
[1:14:53] did I love the way
[1:14:55] brother bam says it he says I I just I
[1:14:57] can't tell you all about it but I know
[1:15:00] it works amen that's you you get up here
[1:15:03] I tell you my experiences I tell you
[1:15:05] I'll tell you all the word that I know
[1:15:06] I'll tell you everything that I know but
[1:15:09] I I can't tell you all of it I don't
[1:15:10] know how it's going to work I don't know
[1:15:11] how we're going to be translated I don't
[1:15:13] know but I believe it and if you come
[1:15:14] with me you're going to go with me
[1:15:17] hallelujah
[1:15:22] hallelujah she could have stayed or she
[1:15:24] could have gone
[1:15:25] but it was worth
[1:15:27] it when she took that step of
[1:15:30] Faith she just knew the Bible says the
[1:15:32] wise shall understand all she had to go
[1:15:35] on was this testimony and the E evidence
[1:15:39] that he brought with her you know
[1:15:42] thinking I was thinking about this you
[1:15:44] know that's all the Israelites had to go
[1:15:46] on when Caleb and Joshua came back was a
[1:15:48] testimony of Two Men And if you remember
[1:15:51] the giant grape uh the giant grapes that
[1:15:55] they had that it took two men to carry
[1:15:57] some on a pole there was evidence there

[1:16:25] spirit and I a mountain is a mountain
[1:16:27] still even after you've been born again
[1:16:29] but God moves those mountains amen he he
[1:16:32] moves those mountains of doubt in your
[1:16:33] life he can do that amen but you've got
[1:16:36] to be baptized into the spirit of God
[1:16:39] you've got to allow him to indwell you
[1:16:41] John 14 he the spirit of TR truth
[1:16:44] indwelling inside of

[1:17:43] even tide and he lifted up his eyes and
[1:17:46] saw and behold the camels were coming
[1:17:49] and Rebecca lifted up her eyes when she

[1:19:50] those that go all the way with it it's
[1:19:53] those that allow that Bel belief to be
[1:19:55] more than words in your mouth that allow
[1:19:58] it to go from your mouth into your heart
[1:20:00] and from your heart into your life and
[1:20:03] in your life to your family and your
[1:20:05] work and every aspect amen I I we've got
[1:20:08] things in our life that we need to
[1:20:10] surrender to God he needs to be in every
[1:20:13] aspect not because he's trying brother
[1:20:15] Jason made that point not because he's
[1:20:16] he he's trying but because that's how
[1:20:19] he's going to get you where he needs you
[1:20:20] to be Hallelujah
[1:20:25] it's it's more than just repeating words
[1:20:27] and and and going to church and
[1:20:29] listening to tapes it it's an experience
[1:20:32] it's life altering it's life changing
[1:20:36] amen and you know I had made that point
[1:20:38] but Rebecca had to leave
[1:20:41] everything you know she had to leave her
[1:20:43] home she had to leave her parents she
[1:20:45] had to leave her family she had to leave
[1:20:47] her duties she had to leave listen the
[1:20:49] comfort of what she's always known
[1:20:52] sometimes you have to leave the comfort
[1:20:54] of what you know amen even in even
[1:20:57] baptized Born Again Christians sometimes
[1:20:59] need to leave the comfortability of what
[1:21:02] you've been doing every day because God
[1:21:04] wants you to take a different turn he
[1:21:06] wants you to go further with him he's
[1:21:08] constantly trying to get you to rise up
[1:21:10] higher
[1:21:11] amen it's all going to be worth it
[1:21:13] brother renom says in the fifth seal he
[1:21:14] says notice Rebecca when the servant of
[1:21:17] Abraham elzer when he came to get
[1:21:18] Rebecca she she she mounted upon a camel
[1:21:22] and the Very camel that she watered she
[1:21:25] rode this camel to meet her unseen
[1:21:28] bridegroom the very thing she watered
[1:21:31] was the thing that took her to her
[1:21:33] future home and husband catch that
[1:21:35] Saints it's the same thing today the
[1:21:38] very thing that the church is watering
[1:21:41] that is the seed the seed of the word
[1:21:43] it's the very word that becomes alive
[1:21:47] and Carries us to our unseen bridegroom
[1:21:51] oh the message isn't just some book it's
[1:21:54] not just some tape it's the living
[1:21:57] reality of Jesus Christ to me oh when I
[1:22:00] listen to something it's almost like
[1:22:02] he's sitting across the table and he's
[1:22:04] opening those words of life to me that's
[1:22:07] what it is for you Hallelujah every time
[1:22:10] you open the
[1:22:11] book
[1:22:13] Hallelujah I want to be the kind of
[1:22:15] believer that stood by the water that
[1:22:16] day and wanted to go further I want to
[1:22:19] feed more than just you I want to feed
[1:22:21] everything in my life I want to give it
[1:22:23] all to you you
[1:22:25] Jesus
[1:22:28] Hallelujah getting back to Jacob here
[1:22:30] for a moment you know until each
[1:22:32] individual has that encounter with God
[1:22:35] and doesn't leave that place until they
[1:22:38] walk different it's only then can the
[1:22:41] nature of Christ truly Rule and reign in
[1:22:45] your life and then the evidence
[1:22:48] displays itself in your life in your
[1:22:53] everyday walk your listen your attitude
[1:22:56] changes those things that you once
[1:22:58] struggled with maybe certain things that
[1:23:01] you once walked close to the line with
[1:23:04] amen those things amen they start
[1:23:07] aligning with the word of God it doesn't
[1:23:10] always happen overnight Saints sometimes
[1:23:12] God is working to get you where he needs
[1:23:15] to be but the moment he places something
[1:23:17] on your heart that's the moment that you
[1:23:20] need to act on it
[1:23:23] amen and it's when that experience
[1:23:27] matches up
[1:23:29] exactly with the word
[1:23:32] exactly what was it with Jacob in verse
[1:23:35] 24 I had said and Jacob was left
[1:23:40] alone as simple as that is that verse is
[1:23:43] so powerful because I want you to notice
[1:23:45] his family came we read that his family
[1:23:47] came with him all of his servants
[1:23:49] everybody in Jacob's life all of his
[1:23:51] possessions everything was with Jacob
[1:23:54] but but Jacob was left alone because
[1:23:57] having that experience doesn't happen
[1:24:00] with you and and somebody else it
[1:24:03] doesn't happen with you and your parents
[1:24:04] it doesn't happen with you and your
[1:24:06] spouse it doesn't happen with you and
[1:24:07] your friend it doesn't happen with you
[1:24:08] and your girlfriend you and your
[1:24:09] boyfriend it happens with you and God
[1:24:11] Alone amen God gives us those things he
[1:24:13] gives us families he gives us spouses he
[1:24:15] gives us friends and I'm thankful for
[1:24:17] those things amen but it has to be you
[1:24:21] and God Alone
[1:24:25] it has to be done
[1:24:27] alone Jacob was an eagle and when that
[1:24:31] eagle gets to a point man that clock is
[1:24:33] working against me he was an eagle and
[1:24:36] then that eagle gets to a point in his
[1:24:38] natural life for it to start spreading
[1:24:40] its wings the mama eagle takes it up
[1:24:43] there always watching over it but she
[1:24:46] lets it start
[1:24:47] flying on its own in the atmospheres of
[1:24:50] life amen and I believe that God is
[1:24:53] looking for us to take flight Amen
[1:24:55] brother bom says and he's talking about
[1:24:57] the eagle nature he says you get up
[1:24:59] there where you trust God to believe him
[1:25:02] for healing to believe him for salvation
[1:25:04] you believe him for the Holy Ghost you
[1:25:06] believe him for everything trust him
[1:25:08] your Eagles you're you're you're you're
[1:25:10] child of God you believe like God does
[1:25:13] wow what a statement you believe his
[1:25:16] word because why because you've been
[1:25:18] feeding on his word you've been fed by
[1:25:21] the Holy Ghost the word and then you can
[1:25:23] fly
[1:25:24] oh I love that that's in the Feast of
[1:25:26] trumpets 1964 I love that because you
[1:25:29] believe his word because you've been
[1:25:31] feeding on his word amen later on in
[1:25:34] that sermon he says there shows that
[1:25:36] we've got to come again with that same
[1:25:38] spirit that was on John he introduced
[1:25:40] the Messiah he was greater than all the
[1:25:42] prophets he introduced it and we've got
[1:25:44] to come to a place again to something
[1:25:47] that's going to introduce the Messiah
[1:25:49] that's what the message came to do to
[1:25:50] introduce the Messiah Hallelujah and how
[1:25:53] will the Messiah the people that
[1:25:56] believes him knowing the people that's
[1:25:58] believing him know it unless they're
[1:26:01] constantly in the word to know Daniel
[1:26:05] said the wise shall know but the foolish
[1:26:07] the unwise wouldn't know they shall know
[1:26:10] their God now now how shall he appear in
[1:26:13] the last days to bring the people back
[1:26:16] to his word so that the bride will know
[1:26:18] her husband and he'll know her mate the
[1:26:21] revealed word that's why it has to
[1:26:23] happen the way that it did that's why
[1:26:25] you can't just read the words on the
[1:26:27] page it has to become a living reality
[1:26:29] because it has to change your life if
[1:26:31] you just read it like a book from page
[1:26:33] to page it's never going to affect
[1:26:35] change in your life but when you apply
[1:26:37] it when you listen to The Prophet's
[1:26:39] words when you hear it then you
[1:26:41] recognize it then you can act on it and
[1:26:43] then God can change you from glory to
[1:26:45] glory
[1:26:46] amen he goes on to say this and as the
[1:26:49] eagle stirreth her nest in
[1:26:52] 1958 and flutter over her Young young he
[1:26:54] says well you know she watched because
[1:26:56] once in a while one gets out of order
[1:26:59] kind of goes Topsy Turvy you know gets
[1:27:01] to floing around and and can't get his
[1:27:04] balance again and the prophet
[1:27:07] says I sure believe in
[1:27:10] grace aren't you thankful for
[1:27:13] Grace then mother Eagle Jehovah Eagle
[1:27:15] you know what she does she flies right
[1:27:17] down and she catches him on his wings
[1:27:19] and bears him right back into Grace
[1:27:22] again that's the way she does it that's
[1:27:24] the way the mother Eagle does don't be
[1:27:26] scared to do some flopping some trying
[1:27:29] some pressing some taking God his word
[1:27:32] you can't go wrong you're not going to
[1:27:33] hurt yourself you ain't going to hurt
[1:27:34] yourself say well he might let me hit
[1:27:36] the ground them little Eagles don't
[1:27:38] worry nothing about it they see Mama all
[1:27:41] the time they're having a Pentecostal
[1:27:42] Jubilee just having a big old big time
[1:27:45] flopping anything they're having a big
[1:27:47] time you you don't be scared you're
[1:27:49] you're G to you might mess up every once
[1:27:52] in a while but you'll know the change
[1:27:55] has set in because you won't be able to
[1:27:58] leave yourself in that messed up
[1:28:00] condition oh I know I fell today Lord
[1:28:02] but I don't want to stay Fallen I don't
[1:28:04] want to stay that way Lord Lord fly me
[1:28:07] back up into Grace again forgive me Lord
[1:28:09] with a contrite heart Lord I come to you
[1:28:12] oh and he flied you right back up into
[1:28:14] Grace again
[1:28:19] hallelujah it's a clear change in your
[1:28:22] life that Vision that Jacob had you know
[1:28:25] God had told him about his lineage and
[1:28:27] how they were going to be like the sand
[1:28:29] of the sea and you know what he was what
[1:28:31] he was
[1:28:32] doing was he was giving Jacob insight to
[1:28:37] his
[1:28:38] victory he was giving him insight to his
[1:28:41] future and you know wow that was a
[1:28:43] mighty experience I've never had a
[1:28:45] vision you know I've had some things
[1:28:47] that were really Vivid in my life and
[1:28:49] the Lord really corrected me on things
[1:28:50] amen I hope we all have but I've never
[1:28:53] had a Vision like that but I would
[1:28:55] imagine that my that would be quite an
[1:28:57] experience to have something like that
[1:28:59] amen but Jacob didn't come face to face
[1:29:03] until four chapters later at the pineal
[1:29:06] experience this time it was it was
[1:29:08] tangible amen this time it was a
[1:29:13] revelation it's not until you come to
[1:29:15] that critical place in your life where
[1:29:18] where Christ has gotten you into a place
[1:29:23] and you are willing to surrender all of
[1:29:26] it amen you're willing to have your name
[1:29:29] changed amen even though because you
[1:29:32] know even though Jacob was always
[1:29:33] ordained to that Jacob's life still
[1:29:36] reflected that old character but this
[1:29:38] time it was different it was it wasn't
[1:29:39] just the surface level it wasn't surface
[1:29:41] level religion I don't want surface
[1:29:43] level religion I don't want to just hear
[1:29:45] a nice psychology sermon I don't want to
[1:29:46] just hear oh that was that itched my
[1:29:48] ears a little bit that was great no I
[1:29:50] want to I want to hear something that
[1:29:51] changes me I want the pastor to get up
[1:29:53] and correct to me I want him to say no
[1:29:55] you need to do something different you
[1:29:57] need to live higher than you're living
[1:29:58] you need to change this you need to go
[1:30:00] further with Christ amen because that'll
[1:30:03] affect change in your
[1:30:05] life it's got to be more than just a
[1:30:07] bethl experience experiences with God
[1:30:10] are great and I believe whatever
[1:30:12] experience that you have is great but if
[1:30:14] you come face to face with God and I
[1:30:16] believe that even if you have come face
[1:30:18] to face that God will still give you
[1:30:20] experiences all throughout your life
[1:30:23] amen and you'll know that it's real
[1:30:25] because it matches the word aligned
[1:30:27] perfectly with everything it says
[1:30:31] hallelujah glory to God your thought
[1:30:33] patterns change everything about your
[1:30:36] life changes
[1:30:39] amen glory to God because why because
[1:30:42] you've got his Spirit living in you
[1:30:46] now
[1:30:49] amen you know I was listening to the
[1:30:51] prophets a couple weeks ago and and he
[1:30:53] was talking about John the Baptist I
[1:30:55] think he actually was quoting another
[1:30:56] Minister but he said you know talking
[1:30:58] about John the one who had in the Bible
[1:31:01] who who they said receive the holy ghost
[1:31:04] in the in the womb of his mother amen
[1:31:05] the one who baptized Jesus in the Jordan
[1:31:08] he was the one who watched the Holy
[1:31:10] Spirit descend like a dove and he had
[1:31:13] gotten into a point in his life in
[1:31:16] prison brother bham says that his Eagle
[1:31:18] Eye had gotten filmed over down there in
[1:31:21] prison
[1:31:25] sometimes those pressures in life
[1:31:27] whatever it is Trials circumstances
[1:31:30] whatever it is sometimes they film over
[1:31:33] your eyes a little bit amen and that
[1:31:35] does not mean that you're not a Believer
[1:31:38] saints of God that just means that God
[1:31:41] has a little growth to get you from
[1:31:43] don't ever let the devil lie to you amen
[1:31:46] if there's a desire in your heart oh
[1:31:49] then then he's still there glory to God
[1:31:52] a man who was a witness this a man who
[1:31:54] was a witness he witnessed Jesus amen
[1:31:57] yet he got into this trial in his life
[1:31:59] and and his eagle eyes got filmed over
[1:32:02] and he said you know he had this brother
[1:32:03] ROM said he like Elijah he had this
[1:32:06] breakdown and when he was under the
[1:32:07] juniper tree you know John had that
[1:32:09] breakdown in prison and he was a
[1:32:11] high-pitched Prophet them nerves on edge
[1:32:14] then his eagle eyes got filmed over he
[1:32:17] said go see if I've been wrong ask ask
[1:32:19] him if he is the one or another do we
[1:32:23] look for another one John sent his
[1:32:24] disciples when he was in prison say are
[1:32:26] you the one or or do we look for another
[1:32:28] one the one who baptized him the one who
[1:32:30] saw the spirit of God descend like a
[1:32:32] dove because what happened he says Jesus
[1:32:35] never sent any book to say now here's to
[1:32:37] have patience when you're in
[1:32:39] jail or so forth what did he say what
[1:32:41] did he tell him he said just stay and
[1:32:43] watch this afternoon's meeting and then

[1:33:07] place where I was to now where I am and
[1:33:09] I want him to take me further
[1:33:12] Hallelujah glory to
[1:33:16] God sometimes you you read these things
[1:33:18] and you know it helps you recognize our
[1:33:20] human nature a little bit amen cuz we
[1:33:23] all we've got it you know and it helps
[1:33:25] us to understand the things that we go
[1:33:28] through in life Prophet says this and
[1:33:31] this all right tonight amen I I just I
[1:33:33] have a lot of quotes but quotes are
[1:33:35] awesome he says in letting off the
[1:33:37] pressure he says this old Eagle he gets
[1:33:38] crusted over his face and head when he
[1:33:40] gets old can hardly eat he gets poor his
[1:33:43] mouth won't shut right gets almost
[1:33:45] blinded and when that crust gets to a
[1:33:49] certain point a spot over his head they
[1:33:51] say he flies up way in the air and he
[1:33:54] sits there and he beats his head against
[1:33:57] that rock knocking the crust off if he
[1:34:00] can and he rolls his eyes and looks back
[1:34:03] and he beats the crust oh it must come
[1:34:05] off it's got to come off if it don't
[1:34:08] he's going to die he's got to get the
[1:34:10] crust off his face and his mouth and
[1:34:13] he'd beat his head one way and then
[1:34:17] another when he it against that rock
[1:34:20] until the crust comes off then he
[1:34:22] screams and he throws his wings back and
[1:34:25] forth and rejoices because he knows he's
[1:34:27] going to get new feathers he knows he's
[1:34:30] going to eat his vitamins again he's
[1:34:31] going to refresh he's going to renew his
[1:34:33] Youth and I thought what a wonderful
[1:34:35] thing that is for the eagle oh but I
[1:34:37] know a rock a man that can come in and
[1:34:41] be and be until all the doubt is gone he
[1:34:43] said until the worries and until the
[1:34:45] cares of Life are gone and to beat the
[1:34:48] crust of Sin from around him until the
[1:34:51] blood has Sanctified his soul
[1:34:54] and then eternal life can come in and

[1:35:48] blood of Jesus Christ can come in into
[1:35:50] that Soul he says God thanks be to God
[1:35:55] it's the grace of God in these examples
[1:35:58] and in our life you know we're I'm not
[1:36:01] nobody special we're not nobody special
[1:36:03] but it's the grace of almighty God in
[1:36:05] our life that placed a seed and through
[1:36:09] the process of this life he ordained us
[1:36:14] to something greater I don't know why he
[1:36:16] chose me oh but I'm thankful he did I
[1:36:18] don't know why I look at myself I don't
[1:36:20] know why oh but thanks be to God amen
[1:36:24] you know to see how how Rebecca she had
[1:36:26] lived in a foreign place it was just an
[1:36:28] ordinary girl living an ordinary life
[1:36:31] yet one day at the well that she would
[1:36:33] often visit one day it was the same well
[1:36:37] she had always gone to came a messenger
[1:36:40] and she recognized that his message was
[1:36:43] something that resonated in her heart
[1:36:47] glory to God and she followed the
[1:36:49] testimony of that messenger all the way
[1:36:53] back to her future husband Hallelujah to
[1:36:56] Bear a son by the name of Jacob amen who
[1:36:59] would later be called Israel after he
[1:37:01] submitted his life to God so he could
[1:37:04] bear a son named Joseph so Joseph could
[1:37:07] be a perfect type of Christ then and
[1:37:09] Jacob had a son named Judah and our
[1:37:12] precious Lord Jesus was the lion of the
[1:37:14] tribe of Judah

[1:37:18] all these scripture ties together so

[1:37:31] time he says you know you are in that
[1:37:34] Galatians your Christ your your you are
[1:37:37] Christ's Heirs of that promise and I I
[1:37:40] think just if just for a moment we can
[1:37:43] forget about everything else you know

[1:37:47] you know in the start of that chapter
[1:37:49] when he was walking you know he he had a
[1:37:51] plan amen he had he had a situ in his
[1:37:53] life he was he was on a mission to go
[1:37:55] back you know and his brother was there
[1:37:57] he hadn't seen his brother in a long
[1:37:58] time the last time he saw his brother
[1:37:59] was when he fled for his life amen and
[1:38:01] and so and and so he had all these
[1:38:03] things no doubt going on in his mind he
[1:38:05] had a lot of situations amen we've got a
[1:38:07] lot of situations I know I get it we
[1:38:09] have work we have we have school we have
[1:38:10] these situations but can you just for a
[1:38:12] moment stop all those things and get
[1:38:15] alone with God and allow him to come in
[1:38:17] and saturate your mind saturate your
[1:38:20] spirit for a minute and just let him
[1:38:22] change you let him change you I know
[1:38:25] yeah I believe that you've all had an
[1:38:26] experience with God but tonight could be
[1:38:28] a fresh experience tonight can be
[1:38:30] something where you can tangibly grab a
[1:38:33] hold of Amen you know this was just a
[1:38:36] pit stop for Jacob and we read that in
[1:38:38] the
[1:38:39] text but it was possibly the most
[1:38:42] important pit stop in his entire life
[1:38:46] anything that ever happened until and
[1:38:48] and he wasn't going to leave that place
[1:38:50] until God had blessed him
[1:38:54] I believe it's sometimes in those in
[1:38:56] those things when we're presented with a
[1:39:01] choice that God wants us to step out in
[1:39:04] faith and walk towards his promise I
[1:39:09] think it was in the quote of the day
[1:39:10] today brother Brandon would say you know
[1:39:12] as a as a prophet you'd think that God
[1:39:14] gives me all the direction everything
[1:39:16] but he says a lot of times he leaves me
[1:39:19] where I just need to walk by faith I
[1:39:20] have to I have to really trust God I
[1:39:22] have to really pray I have to you know
[1:39:24] he's he's not telling me where I need to
[1:39:26] go so I have to really consecrate
[1:39:27] ourselves sometimes you get into that
[1:39:30] situation God is looking for you to take
[1:39:32] a step of Faith towards the word take a
[1:39:35] step of Faith towards whatever it is
[1:39:37] that you that you need in your life take
[1:39:39] a step of Faith toward it
[1:39:41] amen had she waited you know maybe her
[1:39:44] family would have tried to persuade her
[1:39:46] differently or maybe the devil would
[1:39:48] have offered some alternative no doubt
[1:39:50] that probably would have happened but
[1:39:52] she trusted the word of that messenger
[1:39:55] and was rewarded greatly and I just I
[1:39:58] just want you to just as just a me you
[1:40:01] don't let the the cares of Life distract
[1:40:04] you not just now not just tonight but
[1:40:06] don't let the cares of Life distract you
[1:40:09] from getting an experience every morning
[1:40:13] every day and I know sometimes it's
[1:40:15] really hard to to get up in the morning
[1:40:17] I know I know it sometimes just it's
[1:40:18] hard to do that but allow God to change
[1:40:21] you a little bit more every day day
[1:40:24] every single day amen don't let the
[1:40:27] devil keep you so focused on the natural
[1:40:30] things I am probably worst of all I get
[1:40:33] focused on the natural things and this
[1:40:35] and paying this and and going here and
[1:40:37] and getting that and I just get too
[1:40:40] hyper focused we get that way but just
[1:40:42] stop for a second and say God created me
[1:40:46] to be in His image and I'm going to
[1:40:48] trust him for all of it amen
[1:40:55] don't miss the most important Pit Stop
[1:40:58] you know in in in Gideon's
[1:41:00] life 10,000 soldiers had remained but
[1:41:03] God had predes had predestinate a few he
[1:41:06] foresaw that it was going to be just a
[1:41:09] few hundred that he was pulling out of
[1:41:13] that number you know and I I really
[1:41:15] believe it doesn't mean that you're not
[1:41:16] going to struggle at times amen because
[1:41:19] when Gideon came I love this we're we're
[1:41:22] coming down to a close in just a few
[1:41:23] minutes
[1:41:25] but Gideon had come into a point after
[1:41:28] God had weaned down his
[1:41:30] army and it was only 300 men and his
[1:41:33] eagle eyes had gotten filmed over just
[1:41:35] like John's had Gideon Gideon was afraid
[1:41:39] this Mighty Man of Valor he was afraid
[1:41:42] and you know what God did God met him
[1:41:45] right there he he met him right there
[1:41:47] just like he did John the Baptist and he
[1:41:49] said in judges 77 and the Lord said unto
[1:41:52] Gideon by the 300 men that lapped will I
[1:41:56] save you and deliver the midianites into
[1:41:59] thy hand and let all other people go
[1:42:02] every man unto his place so the people
[1:42:04] took the victuals in their hands and the
[1:42:06] trumpets and he sent all the rest of
[1:42:08] Israel every man un his tent and
[1:42:10] retained those 300 men and the host of
[1:42:12] Midian was beneath him in the valley and
[1:42:15] it came to pass that same night that the
[1:42:18] Lord said unto him arise and go down to
[1:42:21] the host for I have delivered into hand
[1:42:24] but verse 10 of Judges 7 if thou fear to
[1:42:28] go down go thou with pure of thy servant
[1:42:32] down to the host and catch this he says
[1:42:35] now and thou shalt hear what they say
[1:42:37] and afterward shall thy hands be
[1:42:40] strengthened to go unto the host so then
[1:42:43] he went down with Pura his servant under
[1:42:45] the outside of the Armed men that were
[1:42:47] in the host and the midianites and the
[1:42:49] amalik sites and the children of the
[1:42:50] East lay along in the valley like
[1:42:53] grasshoppers for multitude and their
[1:42:55] camels were without number and as the
[1:42:58] Sand by the seaside for multitude the
[1:43:02] enemy was out was was without number
[1:43:04] they were overwhelming I believe you get
[1:43:06] overwhelmed sometimes in things in your
[1:43:08] life amen but when Gideon was come
[1:43:11] behold there was a man that told a dream
[1:43:13] unto his fellow and said behold I
[1:43:16] dreamed a dream and low a cake of barley
[1:43:18] bread tumbled in the host of Midian and
[1:43:20] came into a tent and smote it that fell
[1:43:22] and over turned it that the tent lay
[1:43:24] long and his fellow servants answered
[1:43:26] and said there is nothing else save the
[1:43:28] sword of Gideon and the son of joash a
[1:43:31] man of Israel for into his hand hath God
[1:43:34] delivered Midian and all the host and it
[1:43:37] was so when Gideon heard the telling of
[1:43:39] the dream and the interpretation of that
[1:43:40] he worshiped and returned to the host of
[1:43:42] Israel and said arise for the Lord has
[1:43:45] delivered you delivered into your hand
[1:43:47] the host of Midian what was God doing
[1:43:50] there he was giving Gideon insight to
[1:43:53] his victory he gave him a promise he
[1:43:56] gave him his word you're going to
[1:43:57] conquer your foes but he knew that this
[1:43:59] was a time of great travail for Gideon
[1:44:02] and his army so he met him right there
[1:44:05] he knew the Mind battles that Gideon was
[1:44:07] having so he said if you do fear I give
[1:44:10] you my word but but if you do fear go
[1:44:13] ahead and raise up and I'm going to do
[1:44:15] something Supernatural in your life oh
[1:44:17] and he sent him down oh saints of God
[1:44:19] you might not have caught it but this
[1:44:21] was Supernatural he went down into the
[1:44:23] host of the enemy's camp and two of the
[1:44:26] enemy soldiers testified of their defeat
[1:44:29] one had a dream and one had an
[1:44:31] interpretation of a dream and a man by
[1:44:33] the name of Gideon heard that and he
[1:44:35] heard that that was the Declaration from
[1:44:37] the Lord God that he was giv him insight
[1:44:40] to his victory Oh Glory to God you could
[1:44:42] have insight to your victory tonight he
[1:44:45] sees every thought he sees every mind
[1:44:47] battle he sees every trial in your life
[1:44:50] and he's here tonight to give you

[1:45:10] amazing things for his children he
[1:45:12] really does never forget the amount of

[1:45:17] about in your life even the things that
[1:45:20] you don't realize that he does he does a

[1:56:27] amen going once going twice brother test
[1:56:31] praise the Lord am we um went to go get
[1:56:34] new tires for our car finally after
[1:56:37] putting 105,000 miles on the set that
[1:56:39] was on there surprising they lasted that
[1:56:41] long but that's a blessing in its in its
[1:56:44] own but um so went in get tires put on
[1:56:47] and uh there was I had tires put on my
[1:56:51] truck and I was supposed to get 100 uh
[1:56:52] Ford pass points for putting those tires
[1:56:54] on and I never ended up getting them and
[1:56:56] so last minute we're trying to figure
[1:56:58] out why we didn't get them and we
[1:56:59] realized that they had actually put
[1:57:01] underneath the wrong vehicle so it was a
[1:57:03] VIN number for a 2017 Expedition which I
[1:57:06] don't own and so that's why I never got
[1:57:08] them somebody else ended up with them I
[1:57:10] guess and so I went in and I said
[1:57:12] something to him and he's like um he
[1:57:15] said I I'll take care of it we'll we'll
[1:57:17] figure something out and so I got tires
[1:57:19] in linen it's going to be like $1,200
[1:57:21] and so
[1:57:22] went to pick it up and it was only 8800
[1:57:24] bucks and I was like when I got to
[1:57:26] looking he took the alignment off which
[1:57:27] was $140 plus he gave us a 15 $50
[1:57:30] discount plus a couple other things and
[1:57:32] by time it was all said and done ended
[1:57:34] up only being $800 for the tires and
[1:57:35] alignment and everything so wow aw
[1:57:38] praise the Lord
[1:57:41] amen amen that is good amen any more
