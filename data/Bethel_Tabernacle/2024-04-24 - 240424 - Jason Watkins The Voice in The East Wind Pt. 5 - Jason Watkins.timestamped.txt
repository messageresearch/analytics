[39:29] whole weekend and so sister Debbie and I

[39:33] Carolina visit with her dad there and we
[39:35] always enjoy that amen I think he would
[39:38] just have us live there amen I just look
[39:41] forward to the time when miles won't
[39:43] mean anything and we can just all live
[39:45] amen together close amen praise God
[39:48] we're going to invite you to the Book of
[39:49] James tonight chapter
[39:51] 2 I left all of my um headset microphone
[39:57] in my in my truck we had it using it in
[39:59] Virginia and so I left it in the truck
[40:02] and we drove sister Debbie's car tonight
[40:03] so I'm going to use the lollipop amen
[40:06] praise the Lord but I can do it amen I
[40:09] used to do it back in the day praise the
[40:12] Lord I Want by the help of the Lord to
[40:16] move right into part five tonight of my
[40:21] series on The Voice in the East
[40:24] Wind and so we just covet your prayers
[40:28] in regard to that you can well let's go
[40:29] ahead and get our scripture read first
[40:31] and then we'll let them switch over to
[40:33] the
[40:34] PowerPoint James chapter 2 very familiar
[40:38] reading verse 14-
[40:41] 26 you have it say
[40:43] [Music]
[40:45] Amen what doth it profit my brethren
[40:48] though a man say he hath faith and have
[40:51] not works can Faith save him if a
[40:54] brother or sister be naked and destitute
[40:57] of daily food and one of you say unto
[40:59] them depart in peace be you warmed and
[41:01] filled notwithstanding you give them not
[41:04] those things which are needful to the
[41:06] body what doth it profit so it it's the
[41:10] thought that counts but it takes more
[41:12] than the thought to count amen so James
[41:16] is drawing a contrast because Paul had
[41:19] said you know it's Faith plus nothing
[41:22] and Paul just almost sounds like he
[41:24] eliminates works at all and that
[41:27] obviously you know you can read from the
[41:30] church history you can you can start to
[41:32] see that ideology going around to where
[41:35] it doesn't matter how I live as long as
[41:38] I've got faith as long as I believe in
[41:40] the Son of God that's all that's
[41:42] necessary so James is addressing that
[41:45] error a misunderstanding of Paul's
[41:48] teaching and brother Brandon points out
[41:50] he's not at all disagreeing with Paul at
[41:52] all he's actually uh amplifying it
[41:56] because Paul told them they should do
[41:58] that they should take what he built as a
[42:00] foundation and build on top of that and
[42:02] that's exactly what James here is doing
[42:06] so right away um he's attacking what we
[42:10] would call today easy
[42:13] believism and you say that's a modern
[42:16] day thing that's not that's gnosticism
[42:18] and it's 20 centuries old all right easy
[42:22] believism is at least in Christianity is
[42:26] 20 centuries old the early apostles were
[42:29] dealing with that very thing and I don't
[42:31] have time to give you a history lesson
[42:33] on that tonight just take my word for it
[42:36] it's not a new
[42:37] phenomenon so he says here in verse 18 y
[42:41] a man may say thou Hast faith and I have
[42:44] Works show me thy faith without thy
[42:47] works and I will show thee my faith by
[42:50] my Works thou believest that there is
[42:53] one God thou doest well guess what
[42:56] surprise eyes the Devils also believe
[42:59] and tremble but wilt thou know oh vain
[43:03] man that faith without works is
[43:08] dead see it's a vain man that doesn't
[43:11] want to surrender his heart to the
[43:12] control of the Holy Spirit he wants his
[43:15] own way right all right watch so it's a
[43:21] vain man that does this verse 21 he
[43:24] gives him another example was not
[43:26] Abraham Our Father father justified by
[43:29] works when he had offered Isaac his son
[43:32] upon the altar because that's the
[43:34] argument they were making and they were
[43:37] actually misrepresenting Paul's teaching
[43:40] that they they were saying well hey you
[43:41] know Paul said he believed God and it
[43:44] was counted unto him for righteousness
[43:46] that's it what more can a man do that
[43:48] was a a Baptist argument that a Baptist
[43:51] preacher tried to pin brother brandham
[43:53] with and he said brother brandham what
[43:55] more could a man do than believe Abraham
[43:58] believed God and it was counted to him
[44:00] for righteousness and brother Brenham
[44:02] said that's true that's all a man can do
[44:04] is believe he said but then God come
[44:07] around and gave him the sign of
[44:08] circumcision as a testimony of his faith
[44:11] that it was real amen see so that's what
[44:15] the Holy Ghost is it's a it's a seal
[44:19] it's a it's a it's signifies that God
[44:23] has accepted your faith as genuine see
[44:26] you brother ROM said it like this you
[44:28] repent of your sins how many done
[44:32] that he said that's you accepting
[44:36] him so but then he turns around and
[44:38] gives you the Holy Ghost that's him
[44:40] accepting you amen see so there's it's
[44:44] obvious that many will come in that day
[44:48] who have obviously accepted Christ and
[44:51] will say Lord
[44:54] Lord see there will be many in that day
[44:57] that do that but they won't make it in
[45:00] because they do not have the token the
[45:03] Holy Ghost the literal life of almighty
[45:07] God all right let's read
[45:10] on was not Abraham Our Father justified
[45:13] by works when he had offered Isaac his
[45:15] son upon the
[45:17] altar seest thou how Faith wrought with
[45:20] his works and by works was Faith made
[45:24] perfect and the scripture was fulfilled
[45:27] which saith Abraham believed God and it
[45:31] was imputed unto him for righteousness
[45:33] and he was called the friend of God so
[45:36] his Works
[45:38] fulfilled that testimony that he
[45:41] believed God and it was counted to him
[45:44] for righteousness but there had to have
[45:46] a fulfillment of that in other words
[45:49] there had to be Wheels put to that that
[45:51] had to produce an action to to to make
[45:55] that a reality
[45:57] so it's not just the thought that counts
[46:00] all right it's your it's your action of
[46:05] Faith he says further verse 24 you see
[46:10] then how that by works a man is
[46:12] Justified and not by faith only likewise
[46:16] also here's another example likewise
[46:18] also was not Rahab the harlet justified
[46:22] by works when she had received the
[46:25] Messengers and had sent them out another
[46:29] way for as the body without the spirit
[46:33] is dead so faith without works is dead
[46:38] also that I I love how plain just sass
[46:43] James is he just puts it right on the on
[46:46] the brass tax as they say let's pray
[46:49] father we thank you for your word
[46:51] tonight I thank you having read it Lord
[46:53] we already have a blessing now Lord we
[46:56] look to you father as we go through this
[46:58] lesson tonight we commit ourselves into
[47:01] your hands Lord for your leadership in
[47:03] Jesus name amen God bless you friends
[47:06] you can be
[47:08] seated uh hey Gideon before you put the
[47:11] PowerPoint up uh turn me to Exodus 12 I
[47:14] want to read about three or four verses
[47:16] out of Exodus 12 while you're seated
[47:19] we'll catch this then we'll go get to
[47:22] the PowerPoint all
[47:23] right so in Exodus 12 I want just read
[47:28] um why don't you give me Exodus 115
[47:31] first Gideon we'll read that one and
[47:34] then we'll start it uh and come down to
[47:36] chapter 12 Exodus
[47:38] 11 and five amen all right and all the
[47:44] firstborn in the land of Egypt shall die
[47:48] now I want you to notice what I just
[47:51] said it's not all the firstborn of the
[47:55] land of Egypt
[47:59] it's all the firstborn in the land of
[48:02] Egypt so it's not just
[48:06] Egyptians it's Hebrews also Jews who
[48:10] refuse to follow the word and apply the
[48:15] token would lose their firstborn as well
[48:18] see and the all the firstborn in the
[48:22] land of Egypt shall die from the
[48:26] firstborn of Pharaoh that sth upon his
[48:28] throne even unto the firstborn of the
[48:31] maid servant that is behind the mill and
[48:35] all the firstborn of Beast now go to
[48:37] chapter 12 verse
[48:45] 7 all right we'll get it in a second
[48:47] y'all and they shall take of the blood
[48:51] and strike it on the two side post and
[48:53] on the upper door post of the houses
[48:57] wherein they shall eat it now drop down
[48:59] to verse
[49:03] 12 for I will pass through the land of
[49:06] Egypt this night and will Smite all the
[49:10] firstborn
[49:13] where say it together in the land of
[49:17] Egypt saying it again not of the land of
[49:20] Egypt but in the land of Egypt both man
[49:24] and Beast and against all the gods of
[49:27] Egypt I will execute judgment I am the
[49:30] Lord verse
[49:32] 13 and the blood shall be to you for a
[49:36] token upon the houses where you are and
[49:40] when I see the blood I will pass over
[49:44] you and the plague shall not be upon you
[49:48] to destroy you when I smite the land of
[49:52] Egypt verse
[49:53] 14 and this day shall be to you for a
[49:58] memorial and you shall keep it uh of you
[50:02] shall keep it a feast to the Lord
[50:05] throughout your Generations ye shall
[50:08] keep it a feast by an
[50:11] ordinance
[50:12] forever now we're not going to go there
[50:15] tonight because we went there now let's
[50:17] switch to my PowerPoint Gideon we're not
[50:19] going to go back to 1 Corinthians 5
[50:22] because we were there last weekend but
[50:24] there is where Paul was saying that when
[50:27] you come to this Feast don't bring don't
[50:30] come to the feast with malice and sin
[50:33] amen but come with the sincere the
[50:36] unleavened bread of sincerity because
[50:40] that was connecting back to this fatal
[50:43] night for all those who would not
[50:46] display the token whether Jew or Gentile
[50:52] you understand so we're looking tonight
[50:55] in The Voice voice I think I can control
[50:58] it here let me try it the voice in the
[51:01] East Wind tonight is part five and I'm
[51:04] just going to I'm not going to keep you
[51:06] long we just want to make a connection
[51:07] tonight in some teaching uh and then
[51:10] we'll get get more into it on the
[51:11] weekend the Lord willing the voice in
[51:14] the East Wind and I want you to think
[51:17] about God's only provided way of Escape
[51:21] now Escape what the judgments of the
[51:23] East Wind remember that it was the east
[51:26] wind that brought the Locust remember
[51:28] that was the eighth plague and we had
[51:30] said to you in previous uh sessions
[51:34] previous um uh sermons in on this series
[51:38] that it's incredible that Pharaoh didn't
[51:41] hear the voice in in the East Wind
[51:45] because seven plagues had already struck
[51:48] and that was the eighth one and then the
[51:50] ninth one and now the 10th one and so
[51:53] we're looking at uh we read in our text
[51:56] tonight the 10th plague which was the
[51:58] plague of death so God's only provided
[52:01] way of escaping that is the bleeding
[52:06] word it had to be blood on display on
[52:12] the door over the door on the two side
[52:14] post amen so we're we're looking at this
[52:17] now to realize and this is where brother
[52:19] brandham would make the connection from
[52:21] the first Exodus to the second Exodus
[52:25] and then the Third Exodus is our day see
[52:28] there's been a resurrection already the
[52:30] graves of many of the Saints which slept
[52:32] arose and entered in with Christ that
[52:35] was the second Exodus now the Third
[52:38] Exodus is our
[52:39] homegoing and it always applies the same
[52:43] way not you notice in the second Exodus
[52:46] the Bible doesn't say all the graves
[52:49] opened right the Bible says many of the
[52:53] uh Graves open many of the Saints which
[52:55] slept arose and so we realize that
[52:58] brother bam goes back and he says it
[52:59] wasn't all the graves that open it
[53:01] wasn't all the Hebrews it wasn't
[53:04] everybody that followed Moses or Joshua
[53:06] or lived under under the judges or under
[53:09] the Kings it wasn't everybody in David's
[53:12] uh in David's Palace but brother
[53:14] brandham said it was those who died in
[53:17] the true faith that Abraham had and
[53:21] those are the ones that went up with
[53:23] Christ and so they had believed in the
[53:27] word as a Living Word and so when we
[53:30] come to our day it's got to be a
[53:32] bleeding word we say this all the time
[53:34] brother brandham talk called it a
[53:35] bleeding word the the word bled for you
[53:38] and what does that really even mean the
[53:40] bleeding word it means that it's a
[53:42] Living Word it has life in it it's not a
[53:45] a a man-made dead gospel it's a living
[53:50] gospel a living word because the word is
[53:54] a person it's the Lord Jesus Christ
[53:57] and he's not you know in heaven shouting
[54:00] down orders telling you how to live the
[54:03] beauty of your Redemption is that he was
[54:06] able to come down and live inside you
[54:09] and live out his life in you and through
[54:12] you and now you are the Living Word you
[54:16] are the word
[54:17] again made flesh in the earth when
[54:21] you're born again of the spirit of
[54:24] God so it becomes relevant to us and
[54:29] this is why when we are looking at this
[54:32] example we're taking this subtitle
[54:35] tonight the final plague this is the
[54:38] 10th plague and it's the final plague
[54:41] and it's death it's the it's the death
[54:43] angel in the land I'm here to tell you
[54:45] something friends I I'm sure that you're
[54:48] aware tonight that you are living at the
[54:51] final plague the Earth is under its
[54:54] final plague and
[54:56] and and death is striking the land and
[54:59] it's and and the only safety is when you
[55:03] are behind the blood when the blood is
[55:06] out in front of you on
[55:08] display so brother brandham would make a
[55:12] statement here from SE does not air with
[55:15] the shook before I go into those quotes
[55:18] let me just make a few more statements
[55:20] because I want this to be real clear
[55:21] tonight because I don't want to have to
[55:23] backtrack on this too much on Sunday so
[55:26] so the token today is absolutely
[55:30] unequivocally the Holy Ghost amen the
[55:34] Holy Ghost acts as a seal it acts as a
[55:37] guarantee it acts as a down payment of
[55:40] eternal life living in the realm of your
[55:43] soul and this is this is the beauty of
[55:46] the statement that brother Matt Matthew
[55:49] made uh in a number of sermons ago when
[55:52] he was teaching on this and he said you
[55:54] know that someday my body will receive
[55:58] what my soul already has I'm looking
[56:02] forward to that friend I'm looking
[56:04] forward when when I won't have the
[56:06] battles of the mind and I won't have the
[56:08] battles of the flesh when the whole the
[56:11] whole me will be one unified faith in
[56:15] almighty
[56:18] God so it is a
[56:21] living uh a life living in the realm of
[56:24] your soul without it and this is this
[56:27] needs to be stated unequivocally without
[56:30] it a person is not born again now you
[56:35] can you you may have repented of your
[56:37] sins and you may be justified of your
[56:39] past Deeds because the Bible talks about
[56:42] if a man will confess his sins God will
[56:44] forgive him and and that can be true but
[56:47] brother Brandon would say but you can be
[56:49] justified and still not yet be
[56:51] Sanctified you can actually be
[56:53] Sanctified and Justified and Sanctified
[56:55] and still not be born again of the Holy
[56:57] Spirit and the foolish virgin are that
[57:00] you understand and there are people who
[57:02] indeed have accepted Christ and have
[57:05] repented of their sins and the Lord did
[57:07] forgive their past sins but that doesn't
[57:10] help them in the future that remits
[57:13] their past sins what are you going to do
[57:15] about the ones today and the ones
[57:17] tomorrow I need a I need a position in
[57:20] Christ that accounts for anything I've
[57:22] ever done anything I ever will do I need
[57:26] to know that the blood that there's a
[57:28] blood that's speaking for me morning
[57:30] noon and
[57:34] night so people are living under a
[57:38] fallen nature that they were born in sin
[57:41] with if they have not been born again
[57:44] this is why Jesus made it so straight
[57:48] that you have to be born again and the
[57:51] scripture is undeniably clear that
[57:55] you're born again by the indwelling
[57:58] spirit of almighty God it's got to I
[58:01] mean the thought is great the thought
[58:04] counts but the thought without the works
[58:06] is dead
[58:08] Faith you understand so it's obvious
[58:12] today in the Holy Ghost era that the all
[58:16] important item as brother Brandon would
[58:19] show us and the scripture makes it
[58:21] really clear is not the chemistry of the
[58:25] blood but what that blood
[58:28] represents when we speak of the token
[58:31] under the first Exodus here in the first
[58:33] Exodus God was not looking for just any
[58:37] kind of blood but he was actually
[58:40] looking for a very particular kind of
[58:43] blood from a very specific animal with a
[58:47] specific nature inside the life of its
[58:51] blood he was looking for the nature of a
[58:54] lamb because that would correspond to
[58:58] the nature of the Lamb of God that
[59:02] wasn't an accident that he said you'll
[59:04] take a lamb and you keep it up this many
[59:06] days and and it's got to be perfect it
[59:08] can't have this blemishes and all these
[59:10] different things and you've got to
[59:11] you've got to offer that lamb and strike
[59:14] the post in the door with that Lamb's
[59:16] blood and so it wasn't just any animal
[59:19] you can't you can't just bring God
[59:21] whatever is convenient or whatever you
[59:24] want he's only looking for one life and
[59:27] that's his own and the only thing that
[59:30] possesses his life is his word so when
[59:33] you reject any part of his word you're
[59:35] rejecting part of his life and there's
[59:37] no chance to get the Holy Ghost and if
[59:40] you don't have the Holy Ghost there's no
[59:42] chance to be born again and if you're
[59:44] not born again you're still living under
[59:47] the sin nature you were born
[59:51] under so what God is looking for is not
[59:55] physical blood
[59:57] but he's looking for the nature of the
[1:00:00] Lamb of God when God sees his own nature
[1:00:04] now this is now we're really getting
[1:00:06] down I'm trying to put
[1:00:08] language because sometimes we brother
[1:00:11] Ram says the the tokens got to be on
[1:00:13] display the blood's got to be on display
[1:00:16] yeah what does that what does that even
[1:00:18] mean come on so we realize so I'm I'm
[1:00:22] trying to just lead you uh line by line
[1:00:24] a piece at a time so just follow with me
[1:00:27] so we know that God's not looking for
[1:00:30] just any life it's got to be a specific
[1:00:33] life which meant it had to be in a
[1:00:35] specific animal and it had to match
[1:00:38] specifically yeah God is Not Looking for
[1:00:41] physical blood he's looking for the
[1:00:44] nature of the Lamb of God so when we
[1:00:46] when God
[1:00:48] sees his own nature say what does it
[1:00:51] mean to have his blood on display what
[1:00:53] does it mean to have the token on
[1:00:55] display it means that God can see his
[1:00:58] own nature displayed through
[1:01:01] you then that's when your token is on
[1:01:06] display and that's when you are part of
[1:01:08] the first resurrection and you'll be
[1:01:12] changed just as sure as the Saints will
[1:01:14] come out of the
[1:01:16] grave and they'll come out of the Grave
[1:01:18] Just as sure as Jesus came out of the
[1:01:21] Grave the very fact that Jesus did meant
[1:01:24] the Old Testament Saints did the very
[1:01:25] fact fact that they did and the Holy
[1:01:27] Ghost fell I'm here to tell you the
[1:01:29] Saints will rise and when they rise you
[1:01:32] will be
[1:01:33] changed because you have all received
[1:01:37] the Life In The Blood amen so I'm hoping
[1:01:42] to really make this clear I'm going slow
[1:01:43] on
[1:01:45] purpose so I want to say it again what
[1:01:48] does it mean to see to say when brother
[1:01:51] brandham says the blood is on display
[1:01:53] what does that even mean it's when when
[1:01:56] God sees his own nature displayed
[1:01:59] through you then your token is on
[1:02:03] display and you are then in part of the
[1:02:06] first resurrection so the
[1:02:08] display of the blood of the Lord Jesus
[1:02:12] now none of us are smeared with his
[1:02:15] blood and none of you have it and
[1:02:18] brother brandham said the chemistry of
[1:02:20] his blood poured Down the Cross nobody
[1:02:22] has that right amen nobody has his blood
[1:02:27] and brother brandham said even if you
[1:02:28] did what would what would be more
[1:02:31] valuable his blood or you and he said
[1:02:34] you would be more valuable say you got
[1:02:36] to be kidding I'm more valuable than the
[1:02:38] blood of Jesus Christ God spent the
[1:02:40] blood of Jesus Christ as a purchasing
[1:02:43] price to get you amen amen understand he
[1:02:47] wanted you he was willing to spin the
[1:02:49] blood of Christ to purchase you
[1:02:53] amen so the display of the blood of the
[1:02:56] Lord Jesus Christ is a display of his
[1:02:59] life it's a display of his nature it
[1:03:03] signifies hear me it signifies that
[1:03:07] something
[1:03:08] transformative has taken place within a
[1:03:11] person's heart and that produces a life
[1:03:14] on the
[1:03:15] outside I'm here to tell you it is folly
[1:03:19] to to to claim and believe that you are
[1:03:22] born again if you are not displaying 24
[1:03:26] hours a day 7 days a week 365 days a
[1:03:30] year if you are not displaying The Life
[1:03:34] of Christ if it's not on display then
[1:03:37] you are not displaying the
[1:03:39] token say what about when I make
[1:03:41] mistakes what do you do about those
[1:03:43] mistakes I'll tell you what I do I
[1:03:45] repent you know why I Repent cuz I
[1:03:48] didn't want to do them that's the whole
[1:03:49] reason I Repent why don't you want to do
[1:03:51] them because I don't have that nature
[1:03:53] anymore I've lost all consciousness of
[1:03:56] sin he that that's that's the promise in
[1:03:58] the scripture that when you're born
[1:04:00] again the the worshipper has no more
[1:04:02] conscience of sin it's gone from me I
[1:04:04] don't want that kind of life anymore
[1:04:07] there's no desire in me to be
[1:04:10] fashionable to the degree that I'll
[1:04:13] dress ungodly there's no desire to chase
[1:04:16] riches that that causes my lifestyle to
[1:04:19] become carnal there's no desire in me to
[1:04:23] have friends that are going to lead me
[1:04:24] astray there's no desire in me to go all
[1:04:28] over the world and go everywhere except
[1:04:30] church I don't have those desires I've
[1:04:33] had my nature
[1:04:35] [Applause]
[1:04:37] changed
[1:04:39] God that's that's the that's the the
[1:04:43] absolute truth of
[1:04:45] it
[1:04:47] friends it's not an
[1:04:50] accident that that the ministry
[1:04:53] here has preached so much recently on
[1:04:57] the Holy Ghost amen and I can tell you
[1:05:00] it's not just here it's everywhere I go
[1:05:04] it's every preacher I'm talking to it's
[1:05:06] sermons I'm hearing online I believe
[1:05:09] that we are soon going home Hallelujah I
[1:05:13] believe soon the trumpet will sound and
[1:05:16] the dead in Christ shall rise and I want
[1:05:18] to be ready and I want you to be ready
[1:05:20] and I don't want you to believe the
[1:05:22] modern-day lie that it doesn't matter
[1:05:25] how you live or how you look or how you
[1:05:26] dress it
[1:05:29] matters you've got to have the token on
[1:05:33] display that's
[1:05:38] good this is why brother
[1:05:41] brandham emphasized that the token in
[1:05:43] Exodus 12 represents the holy
[1:05:47] gy it shows that there's been a
[1:05:50] transformation there's there's been
[1:05:52] something transformative take place and
[1:05:55] Paul Paul said it like this I no longer
[1:05:58] live amen see I died it's not me that
[1:06:03] lives it's Christ that lives see so this
[1:06:06] wasn't just you know a word salad Paul
[1:06:10] was using it wasn't just poetry Paul was
[1:06:14] trying to use language to express a
[1:06:17] living reality that operated down inside
[1:06:19] of his life I'm going to tell you
[1:06:21] something friends that when the blood is
[1:06:24] is on display that's the whole purpose
[1:06:26] for the blood to be on display in the
[1:06:28] book of Exodus because when the death
[1:06:31] angel came through then and when the
[1:06:33] Death Angel is coming through now
[1:06:35] there's a voice in that blood it's it's
[1:06:38] the voice of the Life of Christ and it's
[1:06:41] it's saying listen there's already been
[1:06:44] a death here move on Hallelujah there's
[1:06:48] the blood of Christ who died did you die
[1:06:51] no I didn't die Christ died for me and I
[1:06:53] have received his life inside of
[1:06:57] mine it's a voice that the Life of
[1:07:00] Christ has already been given on your
[1:07:02] behalf there's already been a death the
[1:07:05] idea of the token being on
[1:07:09] display means that the presence of the
[1:07:13] Holy Ghost in your life should be
[1:07:17] evident through your actions and your
[1:07:21] way of living
[1:07:23] amen amen just like the visible sign of
[1:07:28] the blood on the door was for the
[1:07:31] Israelites amen for the death angel he
[1:07:35] actually saw it this wasn't a
[1:07:39] metaphor this wasn't a Doctrine this was
[1:07:42] an
[1:07:44] action we we showed you last week that
[1:07:47] that that that that it was to be it was
[1:07:49] to make Christ manifest and we showed
[1:07:51] you how that it meant there had been an
[1:07:53] experience people had an experience the
[1:07:56] Holy Ghost is an experience it's it's a
[1:07:59] it's a death and it's a rebirth and it's
[1:08:02] you dying and Christ being up becoming
[1:08:04] alive inside you there's no shortcuts
[1:08:07] around it you can't just believe
[1:08:09] Doctrine and be okay you can't just
[1:08:12] repent of your past sins and be okay
[1:08:14] you've got to receive the literal
[1:08:16] bleeding Life of Christ and that literal
[1:08:19] bleeding Life of Christ is a bleeding
[1:08:21] word that sin in not only this day it
[1:08:24] was sin in the days of Jesus it was sent
[1:08:26] in the days of the
[1:08:27] Exodus and and and that was God's only
[1:08:31] provided way of
[1:08:35] Escape amen there is such a an
[1:08:38] assault these days H um an identity
[1:08:43] crisis and it's not just a gender
[1:08:46] identity it's a spiritual identity yes
[1:08:48] amen the the gender identity crisis
[1:08:51] going on in the world is simply uh it's
[1:08:54] simply uh you know a product a byproduct
[1:08:59] of the identity crisis of people who
[1:09:03] think they're part of Christ when
[1:09:04] they're not and and the whole world has
[1:09:07] gone after that easy believism that
[1:09:10] Christ loves everybody and everybody's
[1:09:11] going to heaven that's not
[1:09:13] true and I'm here to tell you something
[1:09:15] friends it's it doesn't respect message
[1:09:18] circles it'll come right into message
[1:09:20] churches it tries to come right into
[1:09:22] this church it tries to say it doesn't
[1:09:24] matter you can be modern you can be hip
[1:09:26] you can be like the world I'm here to
[1:09:28] tell you if you've got a desire to be
[1:09:31] modern and hip like the world we've got
[1:09:33] an altar that can fix and repair you and
[1:09:37] set you on the road to
[1:09:39] glory that we're never going to
[1:09:42] surrender this pull pit to easy
[1:09:44] believism I'm here to tell you young
[1:09:46] people I'm here to tell you married
[1:09:48] people I'm here to tell you old people
[1:09:50] I'm here to tell you if you're in the
[1:09:52] building if you're on the internet if
[1:09:54] you're hearing it an archive you must be
[1:09:57] born again you must have the token on
[1:10:01] display it must be the dominating fact
[1:10:05] of your
[1:10:08] life amen it's a visible sign it's a
[1:10:13] visible sign you say well it's it's only
[1:10:17] if my heart's right if your heart if the
[1:10:18] inside's right the outside will be
[1:10:21] right so it's a visible sign of the of
[1:10:24] the blood
[1:10:26] just like it was a visible sign on the
[1:10:28] door for the Israelites it's a call for
[1:10:31] a visible
[1:10:33] demonstration of someone's faith and
[1:10:37] commitment amen I want to say it again
[1:10:41] it's a call for our visible the holy
[1:10:45] spirit is calling all believers yeah
[1:10:49] bring forth a visible demonstration of
[1:10:52] your faith that's why we read James
[1:10:56] chapter 2 it was Rahab who was justified
[1:11:00] by her works it was Abraham who was
[1:11:02] justified say he he was justified by his
[1:11:05] faith but his Works in taking Isaac
[1:11:08] fulfilled what God had confidence that
[1:11:11] he would do brother bam sock talks about
[1:11:14] how God would never have given Abraham
[1:11:16] that unconditional Covenant but he knew
[1:11:17] Abraham would believe
[1:11:20] it so so we find that brother brandham
[1:11:23] says here watch now
[1:11:26] the seed is not air with the
[1:11:29] shook here we are presented with the
[1:11:31] picture oh the seed started now he's not
[1:11:35] he's not in Genesis with Eve he's not in
[1:11:38] Exodus with the Israelites leaving Egypt
[1:11:41] he's he's coming here now to Abraham and
[1:11:45] Sarah and Hagar and and and and we're
[1:11:48] gonna and we're going to bring forth
[1:11:49] Isaac and ishmail watch so that's where
[1:11:51] we are in the scriptures here we are
[1:11:53] presented with a picture old the seed
[1:11:55] started the seed of Promise started in a
[1:11:58] slightly doubted doubt of the original
[1:12:01] promise see how it starts low in doubt
[1:12:04] in the original promise God promised
[1:12:07] Abraham through Sarah to have this child
[1:12:11] amen but now watch the first seat of
[1:12:14] Abraham by the bonds woman come by Sarah
[1:12:18] doubting that this could happen because
[1:12:20] she was old and past the age of bearing
[1:12:23] this is how Ishmael ended up getting
[1:12:25] born ahead of Isaac because Sarah who's
[1:12:29] a type of the church slightly doubted
[1:12:32] the promise she didn't completely doubt
[1:12:34] it she only slightly doubted it and and
[1:12:38] today Israel's paying for that amen the
[1:12:42] whole world is paying for
[1:12:44] that
[1:12:45] see now that's how the church starts
[1:12:48] that's how it always starts you start
[1:12:50] now watch here's a good principle you
[1:12:52] start from the bottom you don't start
[1:12:53] from the top a man trying to climb a
[1:12:54] ladder try to get on top first to break
[1:12:56] his neck you've got to start and build
[1:12:58] up to that so you've got to have the
[1:12:59] foundation
[1:13:01] correct here's the foundation without
[1:13:03] the Holy Ghost you're not born again I
[1:13:06] don't care what you believe I don't care
[1:13:08] what kind of a list of dos and don'ts
[1:13:10] you can check box unless your Nature has
[1:13:13] been changed unless it's the literal
[1:13:16] life of almighty God living inside you
[1:13:18] and through you and you're willing to
[1:13:20] let your little light
[1:13:23] shine that's the found Foundation upon
[1:13:26] which you build everything
[1:13:29] afterwards and here we find the
[1:13:31] beginning of the promise of God being
[1:13:34] made manifest through a slightly doubted
[1:13:37] interrupted program of
[1:13:39] God that's the same way sin begin in the
[1:13:43] Garden of Eden that's how death started
[1:13:47] by sin was when one word of God was
[1:13:50] misconstrued or doubted you can't doubt
[1:13:54] or
[1:13:55] misplace one word of God that's thus
[1:13:59] sayith the Lord cuz it's every word be
[1:14:04] so
[1:14:06] so there there there's no
[1:14:09] chance for you to go in the correct way
[1:14:13] if you begin to believe anything other
[1:14:16] than the foundation where that Paul laid
[1:14:19] the very requirement that Jesus had you
[1:14:22] had to be born again by the spirit of
[1:14:24] God yeah and that has to be on display
[1:14:27] and Paul preaches it James preaches it
[1:14:30] Peter preaches it John preaches it it's
[1:14:33] it it it shows up in your life and you
[1:14:36] can believe it mentally you can even
[1:14:38] agree with it mentally that doesn't mean
[1:14:41] that it is that it actually has control
[1:14:44] of the inner nature of you and that
[1:14:47] hasn't happened if you're not willing to
[1:14:49] let to let that die if you're not
[1:14:51] willing to let that go and lots of
[1:14:53] people come to the altar and repent and
[1:14:56] they for go for years coming to an altar
[1:14:58] trying to get the Holy Ghost it's not
[1:15:01] hard to get all it takes is full
[1:15:04] surrender all it takes is a complete
[1:15:06] death and Annihilation that's the
[1:15:10] foundation see amen so he says here
[1:15:14] watch this all right he says so that's
[1:15:17] thus saith the Lord every word of God is
[1:15:22] true
[1:15:25] and here's
[1:15:26] Sarah even to the promise Sarah being a
[1:15:29] woman which a type of the church gave
[1:15:31] doubt to the original program of God's
[1:15:34] promised word and said you Abraham my
[1:15:37] husband take unto you this beautiful
[1:15:39] maid and live with her and be a husband
[1:15:41] to her and God will give his seed of
[1:15:44] promise to her and I'll take the child
[1:15:47] see just bypassing one little Iota
[1:15:52] changed the whole
[1:15:55] program amen
[1:16:00] amen listen
[1:16:02] friends when
[1:16:05] you obey
[1:16:08] God in 99% of his word and just one
[1:16:13] little
[1:16:14] Iota changes the whole
[1:16:18] program makes you from a pure believer
[1:16:21] to a not pure believer amen see
[1:16:25] one little Iota changed the whole
[1:16:28] program therefore we've got to take
[1:16:32] every word of God as thus sayith the
[1:16:35] Lord every word of God is
[1:16:40] true brother brandham says I'm watching
[1:16:43] my
[1:16:44] time brother brandham coming back to
[1:16:47] this scripture Exodus 127 and they shall
[1:16:50] take of the blood and strike it on the
[1:16:52] two side post and on the upper door post
[1:16:55] of the house so the token had to be on
[1:17:01] display because it's the the because the
[1:17:04] blood is going to be speaking now you
[1:17:06] brother brandham there was so many
[1:17:08] quotes where brother brandham deals with
[1:17:10] this very thought that all I could do I
[1:17:12] just went and I picked a few from his
[1:17:15] 1964 token if you go back to 63 it's all
[1:17:18] through that one it's all through 64 and
[1:17:20] it's in other sermons besides the token
[1:17:23] but I'm just going to give you these
[1:17:25] ones from
[1:17:27] 1964 many Jews want to say he was a Jew
[1:17:32] many of us wants to say he was a Jew he
[1:17:34] was neither Jew nor Gentile he was God
[1:17:37] he was a creative being by the hand of
[1:17:40] almighty God he created the Tabernacle
[1:17:43] he lived in which we know as the Son of
[1:17:45] God that's right the deity Supreme deity
[1:17:49] of Jesus Christ C God dwelt in him amen
[1:17:54] Peter said ye men of Israel Jesus of
[1:17:56] Nazareth a man made known by God by
[1:18:00] signs and wonders you've took with
[1:18:02] Wicked hands and crucified him we were
[1:18:04] Witnesses of his resurrection when the
[1:18:07] Holy Ghost had been poured out upon
[1:18:13] them excuse
[1:18:20] me now we find out that in this great
[1:18:25] thing that as God was identifying
[1:18:28] himself with Israel back there and
[1:18:31] requiring that
[1:18:34] identification now we find out here the
[1:18:36] Jews could say they might say well now
[1:18:39] wait just a minute I'm a Jew I'm in the
[1:18:43] Covenant of Abraham I'm
[1:18:47] circumcised now this is an astonishing
[1:18:49] thing you're about to come privy to
[1:18:53] brother Brandon in other quotes that I
[1:18:54] almost put up I just didn't want to read
[1:18:56] too much tonight he talks about how that
[1:18:59] when the death angel come to the door
[1:19:01] and knocked on the door cuz there's no
[1:19:03] blood on the door and the Jewish father
[1:19:06] not an Egyptian remember it's all the
[1:19:08] firstborn in Egypt not of
[1:19:11] Egypt and a Jewish father a Hebrew daddy
[1:19:14] opens the door with a Hebrew family
[1:19:16] standing behind him and says no sir you
[1:19:19] can't come in here because I'll have you
[1:19:21] know I can take you back here to a
[1:19:23] private room and prove prove to you that
[1:19:25] I'm a circumcised Jew I've got the sign
[1:19:28] of circumcision that's the Covenant God
[1:19:30] made with Abraham I have a covenant see
[1:19:34] not only that but we did slay a lamb and
[1:19:36] there's his Basin sitting on our kitchen
[1:19:38] table full of blood that wasn't the
[1:19:41] requirement the requirement was that
[1:19:44] blood had to be out here on display see
[1:19:47] this conversation was never supposed to
[1:19:49] take place see a lot of times people
[1:19:52] want to have a conversation with god
[1:19:54] well Lord if you you just let me hang on
[1:19:55] to this in my life I'll serve you Lord
[1:19:57] if you'll just let me keep this Lord
[1:19:58] don't take that from me Lord Lord let
[1:20:01] let me have this and I I kind of like
[1:20:03] this so I don't really want to let go of
[1:20:04] everything I'm here to tell you that's a
[1:20:06] conversation you never should have your
[1:20:10] conversation to say Lord Whatever It
[1:20:12] Takes by whatever means are necessary
[1:20:15] strip it from me take it from me
[1:20:17] whatever you got to do I surrender all
[1:20:21] to Jesus
[1:20:25] so he says now we find out here the Jew
[1:20:28] could say they might saywell now just a
[1:20:30] minute I'm a Jew I'm in the Covenant of
[1:20:33] Abraham I'm
[1:20:34] circumcised watch what he says here the
[1:20:38] Covenant had was an if the token wasn't
[1:20:43] displayed amen think of that I'm taking
[1:20:46] I'm talking of a token of this day if
[1:20:50] that blood wasn't displayed that token I
[1:20:53] don't care how much you could show you
[1:20:56] was a Jew how much you said you believed
[1:21:01] you might have been Rabbi priest or
[1:21:04] anything but that token had to be
[1:21:06] applied no it's no no ends or out yes or
[1:21:12] no until he saw the blood he would pass
[1:21:15] over amen see so now look let me let me
[1:21:18] finish reading I'll make my comment some
[1:21:20] fellows might say come aside here I can
[1:21:23] prove I was circumcised at 8 Days the
[1:21:26] priest has record of it my name is in
[1:21:29] the book up there that didn't have one
[1:21:32] thing to do with it if that token was
[1:21:35] not applied the Covenant was annuled it
[1:21:39] was of none
[1:21:41] effect see now I I you know there
[1:21:45] there's many more that I could have read
[1:21:48] but the point that he's making he he in
[1:21:50] one in
[1:21:51] 1963 he said you say oh I I go to the
[1:21:54] brandham Tabernacle and brother brandham
[1:21:57] snapped his fingers and he said that
[1:21:59] don't mean that to God say my mother was
[1:22:02] part of this church that don't mean that
[1:22:04] to God but I believe the message that
[1:22:07] don't mean that to God right amen if
[1:22:10] that token is not on display that don't
[1:22:13] mean that it's not that those things
[1:22:16] aren't noted by God and important to God
[1:22:19] it's good that you're in church it's
[1:22:20] good that you say you believe the
[1:22:21] message but I'm here to tell you the
[1:22:23] devil also believe leaves he's not
[1:22:26] converted see so so so we say well what
[1:22:30] what is it then that's a note and see
[1:22:32] this is this is
[1:22:34] why easy believism can't get you to
[1:22:37] heaven am because you have a covenant
[1:22:41] with Christ that that the Bible says
[1:22:44] that God so loved the world that he gave
[1:22:47] his only begotten son that whosoever
[1:22:49] would believe in him would not perish
[1:22:51] but have everlasting life that's a
[1:22:53] covenant amen and you repented now you
[1:22:56] have a covenant just like they had
[1:22:58] Abraham Abraham believed God and he gave
[1:23:00] him a sign of
[1:23:01] circumcision but brother brandom is
[1:23:04] showing and proving by the Bible that
[1:23:06] that Covenant is of no effect it's
[1:23:09] annuled and you can say I have believed
[1:23:12] on Jesus Christ the son of God and I'm
[1:23:15] here to tell you that may be true that
[1:23:18] may be actual that may be real but it
[1:23:21] doesn't count if the token is not on dis
[1:23:25] playay that Covenant that you have
[1:23:28] between between between you and God
[1:23:30] through Christ is aown there's no way
[1:23:33] you can get access to God through Christ
[1:23:36] if you don't have the token on display
[1:23:38] you know why because the token on
[1:23:41] display is him on display and you don't
[1:23:44] have him on display because you don't
[1:23:45] have him inside you and if you don't
[1:23:47] have him inside you you're still not
[1:23:50] born again Hallelujah and you can say
[1:23:53] and think can do and believe what you
[1:23:55] want and you can let any preacher or
[1:23:58] church tell you that you can live any
[1:24:00] old way and it doesn't matter you might
[1:24:03] even stop coming to this church you
[1:24:05] might even stop doing whatever I'm here
[1:24:08] to tell you that when the Rapture comes
[1:24:10] this church is going to be empty of
[1:24:15] Believers and you will be left behind
[1:24:19] with your unbelief and your desires for
[1:24:21] the world and your your filthy
[1:24:26] Spirit I'm here to tell you God's word
[1:24:29] calls for a total
[1:24:31] separation from
[1:24:34] unbelief amen it was annulled it's of no
[1:24:40] effect no effect
[1:24:43] zero everything that you that you think
[1:24:46] you stood for and that you believed and
[1:24:49] you thought that God was somehow
[1:24:51] obligated to you
[1:24:54] because you you believed on him and you
[1:24:57] said the Lord's Prayer and you joined a
[1:25:00] church I'm here to tell you something
[1:25:01] friends you're going to find out that
[1:25:03] it's going to take a whole lot more than
[1:25:06] that am amen and it's the more that I
[1:25:11] want it's the more that I
[1:25:16] want there's a reason for it being the
[1:25:19] way it
[1:25:20] is it's not an accident that
[1:25:25] that God had
[1:25:27] purposed to redeem Israel amen he had
[1:25:31] purposed he told Abraham you're going to
[1:25:34] sojourn in a land your people for 400
[1:25:38] years they're going to be evily
[1:25:40] mistreated but I've got a 400-year plan
[1:25:44] that I'm going to bring them out with a
[1:25:46] mighty hand you're talking about a
[1:25:47] purpose it's a 4 Century purpose that's
[1:25:51] never going to be reversed and so he's
[1:25:55] going to redeem Israel out of Egypt but
[1:25:58] he would he would do so on the only on
[1:26:02] the basis of righteousness amen you
[1:26:06] understand that you know there there's
[1:26:09] this whole there's many men it's amazing
[1:26:12] how many have written about it I was
[1:26:13] just looking over the various great
[1:26:15] minds from the manage
[1:26:18] thinkers and they all grappled with that
[1:26:21] whole concept between Justice and
[1:26:24] mercy and how do you have Justice at the
[1:26:28] sacrifice of Mercy but if you have mercy
[1:26:30] you sacrifice
[1:26:32] Justice and it it's almost like an
[1:26:34] unsolvable conundrum because God can do
[1:26:37] neither God cannot sacrifice his Justice
[1:26:41] for the sake of Mercy amen and yet Mercy
[1:26:44] rejoiceth against
[1:26:46] judgment the Bible says his throne is
[1:26:49] established in
[1:26:51] Mercy so when we look at it that way you
[1:26:54] you find that that Holiness can never
[1:26:59] ignore sin and that's that's got to be
[1:27:03] an important point that we that we put
[1:27:07] inside this this teaching tonight is
[1:27:11] that you know it's it's got to come to
[1:27:13] more than just saying I believe
[1:27:15] something even if you actually genuinely
[1:27:18] do believe
[1:27:19] it there's got to be that transition
[1:27:22] that comes from your head into your
[1:27:23] heart
[1:27:24] and produces a Life by a new desire I'm
[1:27:28] I'm not talking about sinlessness I'm
[1:27:31] talking about a perfect desire for God
[1:27:33] in his word I'm not talking about you're
[1:27:36] never making a mistake I'm talking about
[1:27:39] that that the consciousness of sin has
[1:27:41] passed from you and your whole desires
[1:27:43] for God and his righteousness and you
[1:27:45] loath your mistakes your weaknesses and
[1:27:47] your failures and you're constantly
[1:27:49] asking the Lord for his
[1:27:52] mercy and this is when Mercy rejoiceth
[1:27:55] against
[1:27:57] judgment but we find that God will not
[1:28:00] spare the Bible tells us in second Peter
[1:28:04] that when the Angels
[1:28:06] sined second Peter covers it in second
[1:28:09] Peter chapter 2 verse four that when
[1:28:11] Angels sinned he spared them not
[1:28:18] amen we find that that that according to
[1:28:22] Paul in the book of Ephesians chapter 2
[1:28:26] that the that the even the
[1:28:29] elect even God's elected family are
[1:28:33] children of Wrath even as others and
[1:28:37] that even we at one time had our
[1:28:39] conversation in the lust of the Flesh
[1:28:41] and the things of the world God made no
[1:28:44] exception Paul tells us in 2 Corinthians
[1:28:46] 5 and this is where we were last Sunday
[1:28:49] because that because he says now when
[1:28:51] you're coming to this Feast which
[1:28:53] brother M says it's a fast it's a it's a
[1:28:56] holy time he said you don't come with
[1:28:59] malice you don't come the way the ages
[1:29:01] came this is a this is now you're coming
[1:29:04] back to the full word and when you're
[1:29:07] coming with the full word you don't come
[1:29:08] with all of that malice and sin trying
[1:29:11] to invent another denomination that's
[1:29:14] not what that's not how you come to the
[1:29:16] Lord that's that's the kind that at
[1:29:18] their tables are full of vomit and
[1:29:20] they're going to be destroyed in the
[1:29:22] tribulation yes amen but when you come
[1:29:25] you come with the unleavened bread of
[1:29:28] sincerity because Christ your Passover
[1:29:32] he was the unleavened bread he had no
[1:29:34] sin in him at all
[1:29:37] amen and so that Paul talks about in the
[1:29:40] second in second Corinthians 5 how that
[1:29:42] even God made no exception even for
[1:29:47] Jesus Christ who was made sin for us
[1:29:51] Paul tells us in Romans 8 that he didn't
[1:29:53] even spare Jesus yeah
[1:29:57] amen think about it he didn't spare the
[1:30:01] Angels amen he didn't even spare his own
[1:30:05] son you understand so when we look at it
[1:30:09] a just God in Exodus 34 tells us that he
[1:30:13] will by no means clear the
[1:30:17] guilty amen the only thing that a person
[1:30:21] can do when they're born in sin you say
[1:30:25] well Jesus wasn't but Jesus became
[1:30:28] sin and the only way that you can escape
[1:30:32] that there's nothing left for you but
[1:30:34] but to be executed because you're born
[1:30:37] in sin and he will not excuse that he
[1:30:39] will not bypass it he will not go over
[1:30:41] it sin must be dealt with sin cannot be
[1:30:46] got around sin cannot be escaped right
[1:30:49] he can't Overlook it he can't wink at
[1:30:52] it see
[1:30:54] he will by no means clear the
[1:30:57] guilty so we found that in in Exodus 11
[1:31:02] that that if even if the Jews who were
[1:31:04] Abraham's children did not put the token
[1:31:08] on display even they lost their
[1:31:11] firstborn amen see so Justice must be
[1:31:18] satisfied amen sin must be paid its
[1:31:24] wages yes there's no escaping it so then
[1:31:29] where are we at what will we do what
[1:31:31] could Israel do what could Abraham what
[1:31:35] could anybody do friends the only way
[1:31:39] that God you say is there any solution
[1:31:41] if there's not a solution we're all
[1:31:43] doomed that's what John was crying over
[1:31:46] because if no one had a solution if no
[1:31:48] one was found worthy if no one could
[1:31:51] come forward and and even if he killed
[1:31:54] me that still won't satisfy him but
[1:31:56] there is one who could give his life and
[1:31:59] then all the sins could be placed upon
[1:32:02] this substitute and God wouldn't need
[1:32:04] you to go to Calvary he would send your
[1:32:07] lamb to
[1:32:08] Calvary and that lamb would be an
[1:32:11] eternal sacrifice and now when God looks
[1:32:13] at me he doesn't see me he sees the
[1:32:16] blood because it's on
[1:32:19] display the blood of Christ is speaking
[1:32:23] for
[1:32:25] me he doesn't see my mistakes or my
[1:32:28] weaknesses he doesn't see my failures
[1:32:31] and my ups and downs and I got them and
[1:32:33] you got them but he ain't got them
[1:32:37] Hallelujah this is why the token has to
[1:32:40] be on display this is why if it's not
[1:32:43] the Covenant is annuled amen it's his
[1:32:47] grace there was no way God found a
[1:32:52] solution in Grace amen there was no way
[1:32:56] he could give Mercy at the at the
[1:32:58] expense of his Justice right so he found
[1:33:02] a
[1:33:03] substitute and the sentence of death was
[1:33:07] executed but it fell on an innocent
[1:33:11] victim friends you ought to be the most
[1:33:13] grateful people who have ever lived to
[1:33:17] realize that
[1:33:18] tonight just how impossible it was it
[1:33:23] was impossible it doesn't matter what
[1:33:26] you believe doesn't matter what you do
[1:33:28] doesn't matter who what church you join
[1:33:31] it doesn't matter a list of rules and
[1:33:33] dos and don'ts and even if you lived a
[1:33:35] life perfectly you're still doomed
[1:33:38] because you're still born in sin but God
[1:33:41] came up with a solution hallah he came
[1:33:43] up with the Holy Ghost and the Holy
[1:33:46] Ghost can be on display in my life now
[1:33:49] now what think you of Christ now what
[1:33:52] think you of the Holy Ghost now what
[1:33:54] think you of having the Holy Ghost on
[1:33:56] display do you do you understand the
[1:34:00] futility of trying to be even even a
[1:34:04] Christian at
[1:34:05] all without the Holy Ghost on display
[1:34:09] what an exercise in futility that will
[1:34:12] get you nowhere
[1:34:15] amen
[1:34:17] nowhere you've got to have a complete
[1:34:19] nature change the whole
[1:34:21] value of the blood of of the
[1:34:24] Lamb laid in the fact that it was a type
[1:34:27] of Christ and that's why the Bible says
[1:34:30] in 1 Corinthians 5 Christ Our
[1:34:32] Passover Christ Our Passover is
[1:34:36] sacrificed for us therefore let us keep
[1:34:40] the
[1:34:41] feast you say uh uh I'm worthy to keep
[1:34:44] the feast no but he's worthy I'm not
[1:34:48] worthy to approach his table I'm not
[1:34:50] worthed to come with the feast I'm all I
[1:34:52] can do is bring the the unleavened bread
[1:34:55] of sincerity the unleavened bread of
[1:34:58] sincerity the unleavened bread no
[1:35:01] man-made ideology no denominational
[1:35:05] Theory it had to come back it couldn't
[1:35:07] stay in the ages that was never going to
[1:35:10] produce a Rapture it had to come back to
[1:35:12] the unleavened bread of sincerity and
[1:35:15] I'm coming tonight with a faith in the
[1:35:18] word of God and I've given my life to it
[1:35:21] and my token is on display and I can
[1:35:23] bring God back his own life and his own
[1:35:27] word and that's why I'm going in the
[1:35:30] Rapture hallelujah amen that's my ticket
[1:35:34] that's my
[1:35:35] token see it was not simply that God
[1:35:38] would provide a lamb but he would
[1:35:42] provide himself a
[1:35:45] lamb that's the beauty of it friends the
[1:35:48] lamb was provided Christ the bleeding
[1:35:52] word The Living Word Made Alive in you
[1:35:58] no wonder brother Brandon would say that
[1:36:01] the Covenant of circumcision was anull
[1:36:04] if you didn't have the Lamb's blood on
[1:36:06] display no
[1:36:09] wonder no wonder because they were all
[1:36:11] born in
[1:36:12] sin they were Abraham's children but
[1:36:14] they were still born in sin the only way
[1:36:17] to escape it to not have the death angel
[1:36:20] come into their home was to have the
[1:36:23] token
[1:36:24] on
[1:36:25] display so today faith in Christ just
[1:36:28] like Abraham believed God and it was
[1:36:30] counted to him for righteousness and and
[1:36:33] and a lot of and a lot of people they
[1:36:37] they use
[1:36:38] that as the basis for easy believism
[1:36:42] right that that Abraham believed God and
[1:36:46] it was counted to him for righteousness
[1:36:48] we'll say well isn't that true of course
[1:36:51] it's true but it's annulled if you don't
[1:36:54] have the token
[1:36:56] amen yes it's true but it's not gonna
[1:36:59] it's not you can't accept that part of
[1:37:01] the word and deny the rest of the word
[1:37:03] because then you're denying part of
[1:37:04] Christ but a prophet is showing here's
[1:37:08] what brother brandham is literally
[1:37:09] showing and pouring his heart out to
[1:37:12] those Pentecostal
[1:37:13] people that to refuse to follow the word
[1:37:18] uned the covenant made to Abraham
[1:37:21] wherein he believed
[1:37:25] and so people believe on Christ and go
[1:37:28] right to
[1:37:29] Hell people believe on Christ go right
[1:37:32] into a tribulation people who believe on
[1:37:35] Christ not everyone that saith Lord Lord
[1:37:39] amen they'll stand there on that day and
[1:37:42] they'll say Lord they'll try to call him
[1:37:44] Lord again did not we do all these
[1:37:47] things in thy name he'll say depart from
[1:37:50] me you workers of iniquity you never had
[1:37:52] my token on dis you never accepted it
[1:37:55] well how we have got it it came with the
[1:37:57] word i i i if You' have accepted the
[1:38:00] Revelation for your day the token that
[1:38:03] that would have entitled you to it it
[1:38:04] would have come into your life and it
[1:38:06] would have taken over your life you
[1:38:08] refused the word therefore you refuse me
[1:38:10] therefore you refuse my blood therefore
[1:38:12] you're standing here guilty it doesn't
[1:38:14] matter that you did all of these kinds
[1:38:15] of Works amen
[1:38:19] see so easy believism is a byproduct of
[1:38:23] the mixture that existed in the church
[1:38:25] ages that's where it came from see it's
[1:38:27] uh during that time you know even under
[1:38:30] the pure word of the alpha churches I
[1:38:32] was showing you at the beginning of the
[1:38:33] sermon gnosticism was already trying to
[1:38:37] come in with that easy believism and
[1:38:39] they're trying to Mi misquote Paul and
[1:38:42] they're trying to they're trying to
[1:38:43] misrepresent what Paul is saying and
[1:38:45] Paul talks about that in his own letters
[1:38:47] people people Paul wrote letters and say
[1:38:49] you know people accuse me that I say you
[1:38:52] can basically live any old away and Paul
[1:38:54] was saying that's not even true
[1:38:55] everybody knows I don't teach that but
[1:38:58] that's what they were teaching he
[1:38:59] believed because people wanted to live
[1:39:01] that way see and Paul had to defend
[1:39:04] himself in his own letters and and say
[1:39:07] everybody knows my manner of life and
[1:39:08] the way I've lived you know and people
[1:39:11] say you know the way if you listen to
[1:39:13] Paul you could just do whatever you want
[1:39:14] to do and that's easy
[1:39:16] believism and that's what James is
[1:39:18] trying to straighten out and people
[1:39:20] saying he's trying to say you people
[1:39:21] misunderstood Paul he's telling you
[1:39:23] himself you misunderstood him and I'm
[1:39:25] telling you this is how you
[1:39:26] misunderstood him because yes it's true
[1:39:29] that Abraham was justified by his faith
[1:39:31] but then his Works followed his faith he
[1:39:34] put wheels to his faith see so so we we
[1:39:38] find then that that's what's been
[1:39:40] restored in this time the time of the
[1:39:42] long awaited restoration the as we call
[1:39:45] it the complete restoration of the Bride
[1:39:47] tree I got to close so so let me just
[1:39:50] let me just close with these comments
[1:39:53] so listen friends I just want us to be
[1:39:55] real clear because I don't want to have
[1:39:57] to go over this again on Sunday because
[1:39:59] we're dealing with the last
[1:40:01] plague just as soon as you
[1:40:06] rejected his word if you reject any part
[1:40:09] of his word if you try to take this
[1:40:13] message and water it down and make a
[1:40:16] lightened version of it because because
[1:40:19] you think brother Brandon was old fogy
[1:40:21] or oldfashioned or you've let somebody
[1:40:24] tell you of all the errors and ups and
[1:40:26] downs he had because he was a human
[1:40:28] being thank God he made mistakes because
[1:40:30] that gives me
[1:40:31] hope and you let somebody tell you just
[1:40:34] like just like I have I have said this
[1:40:37] so many times and I I'll just say it now
[1:40:39] for the sake of the recording just in
[1:40:41] case somebody might hear it you know
[1:40:44] it's amazing that everybody that leaves
[1:40:45] the message backslides
[1:40:49] yeah they they immediately they
[1:40:51] backslide and you know the Men start
[1:40:54] cussing and social drinking and and
[1:40:56] pulling off their clothes and women
[1:40:58] start bobbing their hair and putting on
[1:40:59] men's garments and D dolling all up like
[1:41:01] Max Factor and and they and they think
[1:41:04] that they can now do that they had I was
[1:41:07] brother Donnie was telling me about that
[1:41:09] that you know they've got a podcast now
[1:41:11] and there was a a a non-binary I don't
[1:41:14] even know what that is a non-binary on
[1:41:17] this podcast weeping because now that
[1:41:20] he's come out of the message he realizes
[1:41:22] he's been set free from his prison now
[1:41:23] he can be who he really is he can be who
[1:41:26] he really is a
[1:41:27] devil it's a complete perversion as if
[1:41:30] somehow leaving the message suddenly
[1:41:32] like and I've said this before and I say
[1:41:35] it
[1:41:35] again sister
[1:41:38] dear if you think that you can Bob off
[1:41:41] your hair because now you no longer
[1:41:43] believe William brandham I got news for
[1:41:46] you a woman cutting her hair is not a
[1:41:48] William brandham
[1:41:50] Doctrine that's a St Paul Doctrine
[1:41:53] and it won't be William brandham you
[1:41:55] have to face and leaving William
[1:41:56] brandham or the message won't relieve
[1:41:58] you from what Paul said a woman putting
[1:42:01] on a garment that pertains to a man is
[1:42:03] not a William brandham teaching that's a
[1:42:05] Moses
[1:42:07] teaching that's the
[1:42:09] Bible understand it's it'll be Moses you
[1:42:11] have to face doing that not William
[1:42:14] brandham that is that is a lie that the
[1:42:16] devil is telling people and I'm here to
[1:42:18] tell you something young people you
[1:42:19] listen to brother Jason good don't you
[1:42:21] believe that don't you go that way don't
[1:42:24] you open up your ears to that garbage
[1:42:26] it's a bunch of garbage and nonsense and
[1:42:29] there those people who follow that are
[1:42:31] absolutely going to miss the Rapture and
[1:42:33] they'll stand before God at least
[1:42:35] they'll get a fair trial I'm thankful
[1:42:36] for that I was talking this the other
[1:42:39] day saying I'm glad I'm not the one that
[1:42:40] has to judge them the king will know
[1:42:42] their heart and and know what it's
[1:42:43] really about and he'll know who to Grant
[1:42:45] eternal life to and who not to but I
[1:42:47] don't want to stand there I want to be
[1:42:49] on the
[1:42:50] throne I want to be part of the first
[1:42:52] resurrection I want to get out of here
[1:42:54] when the dead in Christ rise I want to
[1:42:56] be
[1:42:58] changed in a moment in the twinkling of
[1:43:01] an eye hallelujah amen when you when you
[1:43:05] reject any part of it friends that's
[1:43:07] that that's that's that's the same

[1:43:12] the Garden of Eden that you might as
[1:43:14] well re been with Eve rejecting that
[1:43:16] one% you might as well been in Exodus 12
[1:43:19] and rejecting Moses with the blood you
[1:43:22] might as well reject Christ in the
[1:43:24] gospels you might as well reject the
[1:43:26] Holy Ghost falling in the upper room you
[1:43:28] might if you're going to disbelieve any
[1:43:30] part of it you might as well throw out
[1:43:31] all the doctrine of the Apostles and
[1:43:33] Prophets if you're going to disbelieve
[1:43:35] any part of it there's no need to worry

[1:53:52] and if it's not we might as well eat
[1:53:54] drink and be marry for tomorrow we die
