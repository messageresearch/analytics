TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] return to the book of hebrews amen chapter 10 hebrews chapter 10. we're going to teach something here this morning and i'm going to take a title that is going to immediately get attention and so you might say brother matt did you title it that way to get people's attention yeah i did so if you think that that's why i did it i did it that way intentionally i'd stand behind it and we're going to teach why but sometimes you have to use um as brother branham talked about a fishing lure you use something to get someone's attention because you know you got something good to give them amen and we didn't come to firstly say to we didn't we don't teach on this to give you our opinion uh here today but just our reflections on what we see in the word of god hebrews chapter 10 verse 25 i'd like to just teach on why it is a sin to stay home from church hebrews 10 verse 25 and brothers you can put the powerpoint up at any time you'd like to not forsaking very familiar scripture here not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together as the manner of some is so looks like not going to church is not a habit of 2021 post covid but it goes all the way back to biblical times where the writer has to say as some is the custom to forsake the assembly he says let's read it again not forsaken the assembling of ourselves together as the manner of some is but exhorting one another and so much the more as you see the day approaching you can have your seats this morning we're just gonna read some other scriptures and you don't have to put them on the screen so that you can save you can keep my powerpoint um i think i got the clicker here we will just want to hurry through this because we've got a lot to get to i'm going to do quite a bit of reading and i know this will go out online and they'll be able to see these some of these quotations just make sure there was our scripture so the bible speaks about now i'll firstly answer this question immediately and just ask the question myself can a christian forsake the assembling of gathering at church should they no they shouldn't can they well the bible tells us not asks not recommends not good advice but it's commanded actually and it's amazing you have to go back through some of these things some of these most basic beliefs of the christian church of what we believe and it's amazing how often you have to go back to some of the roots because we can tangle things up and get things so complicated um and and people can can can uh construe a idea it's not based on the bible at all so let's go back to the word of god that's what we want to do today is christian gathering at churches local buildings and assembling biblical or is it traditional is it just a church tradition that we have well hebrews 10 answers that very matter-of-factly as the bible says to not forsake the assembling of ourselves together as the manner of some is so what is sin it's unbelief is it a sin to not go to church it is a sin not to go to church now have i committed this sin brother matt if i'm if i don't make a church service is about attendance no that's not at all what we're saying not even closely resembling that it's not about a checklist we don't have a membership peers that can just become religiosity and idolatry really as people as churches nominal churches create a membership book an attendance book and they actually take your attendance like a roll call and we're not speaking about that at all this isn't a checklist this is something that you do out of the desire of a changed heart so when a person becomes a believer a christian and god does something in their heart they can't help as brother branham says but to come to the house of god can i miss will i miss church yeah there's many times i've not been here in attendance uh though those those circumstances have been extremely rare for myself and for some others in different uh places of life it's became uh there's many times that you maybe can't sit here at a seat or thankful in those cases for things like streaming but we're talking about the forsaking of assembling not coming to church for a reason and one that is uh not according to the word so let's just look at that today before we get tangled up in some of that so to answer the question flatly no a christian comes to church that's what a christian does that's what believers believe can they will is it is it a sin when you're not here sitting in the seat no it's not about that i'm speaking of a pattern or a habit a church habit where we forsaking that's a word that has an important meaning we're going to look at here in a minute but we're forsaking whether by excuse or by belief the assembling of ourselves together now obviously there's going to be times in the world where that's impossible there's some places in the world where they have a desire to gather but they can't whether by persecution or it's against the law we went through a time here as a pandemic where we had local government um putting down restrictions now while we wouldn't we wouldn't uh give in to local government telling us not to come to church we're going to gather regardless but there were reasons for that i don't want to go into the weeds there with that there were reasons during the spanish flu that you were it was it was out of the good of the love of your own neighbor to not gather and be around each other during that time but that's not what the bible's talking about when it says the custom of some is to forsake the assembling let's look at this word here the king james version is people let's go back there not forsaking the assembling well brother matt that's speaking of spiritual and as long as we're gathered in heavenly places in christ jesus well let's look at what it actually means the king james translates strong's g1 1996 g-1997 if you want to look up the strong's coordinates on the word it's number 1997 you could look that into any lexicon search and it translates it in the following manner that word assembling gathering together gathering together assembling together outline of biblical uses this is also from the lexicon it means a gathering together in one place gathering together in one place number two the religious assembly of christians this is strong's again new testament word 1997. it means a gathering together in one place physical means in every sense of the word a physical gathering and you say brother matt why is that important because if you go look up hebrews chapter 10 it talks about provoking each other to love it talks about exhorting each other in the word of god what does the bible speak about in the new testament church when it says they continued daily in the apostles doctrine and in fellowship how many bible readers do we have here today you read that in the book of acts they continue daily in the apostles doctrine and fellowship and the breaking of bread so what do you have in assembling or gathering together in one physical place you have fellowship you have provoking each other to love you have encouragement how do you fulfill the scripture if you're streaming if your church is a streaming church and and you stream and that's all you do is stream how do we fulfill the scripture about the new testament church to fellowship one with another and break bread the bible speaks in another place and it says and jesus says uh wherefore i go to prepare a place and it says wherefore comfort each other with these words and i know we can do that by text and i know we could do that by phone call but i think the bible if we're coming back to the bible the bible's speaking of a physical gathering together now i got to put this asterisk in there because we have streaming audience i want to say to you today it's god's will for you to be in church now if you live somewhere there's no local place for you to go at all and to gather into a symbol then i pray that god gives you that place but i don't pray that you stay in that place we have families that have moved here from many miles away that didn't have a church home and stream for years because that's all they could do and thank god they had a desire in their heart to do that but that's not the ultimate will of god for you the will of god for you is to come here and gather i guarantee if you ask brother mark carter there in the back or any of the other brothers or families that moved here the difference in and years of going to church at home streaming versus being connected to a local body it's different and so we just say we appreciate the fact and we know some people are in certain circumstances say brother matt you're going to step on this toe well i'm not stepping on anybody's toe i'm just reading you the word of god amen let the word be our teacher this morning not for the mat being his opinion here or a pet peeve that's not what this is about we're just coming back to the word of god and i know most people have already clicked away and turned to me off anyway so we'll just say this for those archive for those watching by archive so it means a gathering together in one place let me just go back to this let's look at some of these things i love this so much and if brother nathan bryant pastor there uh i think in kentucky or indiana there he put together if he if he watches this he put together a wonderful study i could give you if you text me and and i'll give you the link to that he put together an article a document that's just uh it's very comprehensive very good well put together on scriptures and quotes and we're going to read from a lot of them today what brother brandon believed about going to church let's read some of these scriptures here luke chapter 4 verse 16. if you have a bible go ahead and turn quickly if you could luke chapter 4 i want you to read this there brother mark maybe if it's quick you could put it up our brother brad if it's quick you could put it up i don't want to mess anything up with you there so if it's not don't worry about it but luke chapter 4 verse 16. let's just read it together quickly and he came to nazareth where he had been brought up i know who we know who we're talking about here and as his custom was as his custom was so is this church tradition is this denominationalism is it the opinion of brother branham or the opinion of even the apostle paul no it was actually the opinion and not only opinion the custom of jesus to go to church so when i say i want to be like jesus i include this too he says as his custom was he went into the synagogue on the sabbath day and stood up for to read acts chapter 17 verse 1. we got to move faster acts chapter 17 verse 1 now when they had passed through now i'll give you just a minute to get to there uh verse 1 of chapter 17 of acts acts chapter 17. it says they came to thessalonica where was a synagogue of the jews and notice this verse 2 and paul as his manner was so what's hebrews 10 speaking of it's not about you missing a church service here because you were you had your ox was in the ditch and you couldn't come to church now i know what it means to have an ox in the ditch but i want you to think of that term the ox you're speaking about a farmer who's his purpose of having that ox is to for for for harvesting and for farming so that he could put food on the table listen friends your ox isn't in the ditch when you're using that job to buy the next 20 latest 2022 model vehicle that's not your ox in the ditch that's pharaoh's bricks getting dry that's what that is you say i gotta work brother matt mox is in the ditch really you drive brand new vehicles you have a brand new house and your ox is in the ditch i think what it's speaking of is a man who's trying everything to put food on his table and he's got to work he has no choice or he'll go hungry so let's just get these terms right my ox is in the ditch i've got a business i've got a job satan will give you as we said last wednesday every excuse to forsake the assembling in the house of god that was free it wasn't on my notes acts 17 notice and paul as his manner was went in unto them three sabbath days reason with them so his manner his custom this was a lifestyle it was part of what they did listen to what brother branham says here he says i don't have this on the screen he says i told them tonight usually this is surge we would see jesus in 61 i told them tonight usually it's my custom to go to church somewhere on sunday if i possibly can brother branham did you believe that it was wrong or sinful wrong for a christian to stay home from church well let's find out what he said here i don't have that brothers if you you got to get that back up this isn't going to work too well that's all right just advance it you can just advance it no worries brother branham here you him 1960 it's wrong to stay home from church can you say amen to that i don't agree with that well then you're not a believer i don't i don't really i believe that was brother branham's opinion well then you you don't believe the message but i do listen to what brother adam says next slide here if you have that you can advance that brothers for me we would see jesus 1959 if you loved god you'd be at church you've got to get back to the church back to the bible back to christ discerning the body of the lord we're going to go through these let's just read them a real born-again man or a woman that's got discernment of the holy ghost will find his place in church worshiping and crying out and doing all that's in his life to try to bring sinners certainly christ is the mystery of god revealed in 1963 don't stay home thank you brother brandon i'm glad i didn't have to say that you did if god's in your heart you can hard you can't hardly wait for them doors to open out yonder to get in here to fellowship with your brothers if you don't don't feel that way then i tell you it's time you got to praying god hiding himself in simplicity 1963 a real mother wants to take her baby to church and that's the thing you should do the entombment 1957 then how can you say you can stay home and be just as good a christian as you would be at church you can't do it amen you can't do it the position of a believer in christ 1955. now the fellow said i can be a christian and stay home just as well no you can't no you've got to meet a symbol gather together with the rest of the body he has blessed us together in heavenly places in christ jesus thirsting for life 1960. people say i can stay home be just as good a christian as i can at church you can't well you can't well but no you can't you can't your opinion doesn't matter i'm so glad we've got a vindicated prophet with with infallible vindication that we can stand upon today that i can say my opinion and your opinion don't matter don't matter you might have it you might love it you might exalt it and want anybody to hear it but it don't matter he says you can't the bible said not forsake our assemble ourselves together and that much more as we see the day approach and if you're a christian go to the next one if you're a christian you long to go where other christians are and fellowship with other christians so you cannot stay away from church and live the same life you can't do it because it's like i'm hungry but i'll never go to a table i just i'll never eat i just i ain't gonna do it see you've got to go and feed on the word of god and fellowship notice he didn't leave it with feeding on the word of god i can just stay home and stream brother man i'm getting the same thing no you're not let me say brother sister covet has given more people more excuses to disobey the bible than any other uh thing you want to point out or fear or thing that's happened in this world covet has given more people excuses to just be flat out disobedient to the bible the bible says go to church don't forsake it assemble you say when brother matt anytime the church doors are open he says you're going to do it you got to do it word and get the word of god and fellowship one with another we i love this we need one another more now than ever did need each other is now when you get yourself singled out from the rest of them making yourself just a little different you don't want to associate with them because they believe this and don't want to associate with that you're getting on dangerous ground right then keeping away from church find the one of your choice and remain there and be a christian brother to all of them brother man i don't come to church because i don't i'm not fed at church i i i it's not the choice of my it's not the church of my choice i just not fed anymore i'm going to calm down i'm going to say this very very calmly then find you a church where you can be fed but please don't stay here if you've lost confidence and can't get fed from the ministry at this church you're doing yourself the name of christ and this church a disservice and a harm and i would say go find you a church we love you we'll miss you but we want the best for you we want the best for your soul we love you so go find you a church where you can be fed but please don't stay here while i don't want to hurt anyone's feelings you won't we'll miss you but we want you to go where you can be fed go find the church of your choice whatever you do don't leave here and go sit at home and stream go find you a church then we've got to follow he says here that's the way to be a real christian then we've got fellowship protection people love you and pray for you what visions are listen to this we feel that every person is duty bound how do you feel brother branham well let me tell you how i feel we feel that every person is duty-bound to attend some church and belong to some church as a christian not that many people say oh i just stay home and read my bible i'm just as well off let me give you what believers say i ought to stay home and stream i'm just as well off no the bible said we shouldn't forsake to assemble ourselves together we've got to do that we've got to stand together all the churches possessing all things 1962 our heavenly father thou has chosen that we should gather together it's the will of god that we should assemble ourselves together as we see the day approaching and that regularly lord to bring ourselves closer to you and closer to each other from you questions and answers 1964. now i know they put a pressure on you and want want you to join but you don't have to join but put them kids in sunday school somewhere and you go to church don't sit at home go fishing and hunting and things like that on sunday you say well i'm not a legalist well you better be in that manner for a while dishonoring the resurrection of christ you go to church somewhere well churches you know brother matt it's just different things and you know i you just don't know my story and well i'm just giving you what the bible says many will say lord lord lord many will have many different excuses but here's what we'll be judged by he says dishonor in the resurrection of christ you go to church somewhere i will restore 1954 a man that's born of the spirit of god next slide a man that's born i will restore next slide a man that's born of the spirit of god loves to go to church better than he loves to eat his dinner when he's hungry the spiritual man on the inside has got to be fed that means he loves it more than his job more than his business more than success he loves going to church and he will forsake anything if it takes him out of the house of god if that man isn't fed he will die forsaking all 1962 you who have fallen away stay home on wednesday nights you who have well i just come to church on sunday well let's see what the prophet of god said you who have fallen away stay home on wednesday nights and won't come over here to church watching television and other nights of church do you think brother branham didn't cover this he did thoroughly that's what people do now they stay home on wednesday and watch television they watch the preacher on television amen did my streaming audience say amen you really say if you if you have to come to church you have to force yourself to do it he says because you think it's a law you do it you ought to do it it's honorable to do it and if you don't love to do it there's something wrong there's a holy spirit that makes you love to serve god here you him 1960 but when a christian will stay home from church to see some silly play like that there's something happen in that person's life the holy spirit went out somewhere you're not about the father's business but instead influenced 1963 but instead of that we say glory to god i don't feel like going tonight i believe well i believe i'll stay home and see this good telecast tonight it's prayer meeting but and he says a sleeping church a lady a sean rich oh my there we are does a christian go to church i think it's it's thoroughly established we could read you we could you get that article from me that was page i think four of 19 or 20 pages of quote after quote after quote i could give you scripture after scripture after scripture it's not church tradition and the world changes but god doesn't change amen if we're believers we assemble ourselves together on wednesday night on sunday morning whenever the doors are open we assemble ourselves together because that's what the bible says and that's what we believe we believe the bible and we live by the bible say brother matt you don't know my life listen friends i do i've been there i've watched the devil try to sell me an excuse of why i can't because of my business and i'm just trying to grow my business and i'm trying to i'm trying to do things so i can sow seeds into the kingdom of god if i ever make it you know i'll give back to the family of god and i'll give back to missions field and i'll give back to that that's if you that's if you are still a believer after the devil takes you through the rat race and through the ringers because he'll take you down that little road and i've seen people walk that road of i'm just trying to get my business successful so that i can do something for the kingdom of god and it's funny all they did was build their own kingdom and they're nowhere today they're not at this church or any church or any other church they're taken captive by the devil we don't want to see that amen we say that to you with sincerity in our hearts we want you to be fed we want you to be full we want you to be spiritually healthy and you can't be if you stay home on wednesday nights brother matt sunday mornings oh yeah sunday mornings but we don't seem to have a problem with that here we have a problem with people staying home on wednesday nights it's amazing you watch how many times brother branham covers this subject and over and over again he says people you'd stay home on a wednesday night very rarely says it was i love susie or i love lucy that came on not on sundays but on wednesdays and it is amazing now that our church attendance and our levels when we see the day approaching as the bible says assemble yourselves that much more as you see the day approaching yet somehow we've got a pattern in the tradition in our churches where it's the opposite of that prior coveted we assembled more postcode now that we see that day approaching more and more we're more dis uh we're more disconnected and separated but you got to have unity you got to have fellowship you've got to have breaking and bread you've got to provoke each other in love you've got to be part of the body well the bodies hurt me well that's god's will that you're part of the body satan's will is to single you out get you away get you on some filling or some hurt feeling and keep you segregated or separated from the rest of the body brother adam said it's like a little a lie he says a predator gets his prey that way singles them out gets them away from the rest of the body you ever watch an animal a predator attack a prey what does he do he singles them out and satan singles people out tries to take them out as brother adam said that he said he got eve away from the word of god got her out of the fortification of the word of the body and he said he singled her out got her from outside of the headship of the word what do you think the devil's trying to do so much to get you so busy and so weighed down and so burdened down to disconnect you from the thing that gives you life disconnect you from the thing that gives you health makes you anemic amen and we you know it's amazing sometimes we look around and we we look at our life and say how is how did i get to where i'm at from yesterday to the day how did my life ever get here so much in shambles you know what what i've learned to do is just go back to the word of god and say lord where did i take the wrong turn where did i go wrong let me go back to your word because i know if i line my life up with the word i've got promises and benefits that come with that word let's stand to our feet lord jesus we thank you for your word this morning for all those lord that heard it i pray god that it wouldn't provoke them to hurt feelings or to be upset that's what the devil would love lord but i pray that it would provoke them something inside the something in their heart when they read the word when they hear what the prophet of god had to say it challenges them in their heart and makes them look introspectively and say where is where is my life what what what type of am i even a believer am i a christian am i even in the faith if i don't have the very basic basic custom that jesus had and that was to come to church whenever the doors were open help us lord help our assembly we live in a dark deceptive age and a deceptive time may your word pierce through all the darkness and may it contact that seed this morning bless this service we ask the remaining of it lord in jesus name amen amen god bless you you
