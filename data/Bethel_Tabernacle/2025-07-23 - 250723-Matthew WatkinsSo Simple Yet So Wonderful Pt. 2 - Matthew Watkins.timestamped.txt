[8:12] for that. Remember Katie and the baby
[8:15] Emily. Just help them with the child,

[10:08] When justice called for payment for sin,
[10:16] no one worthy could be found among men.

[11:10] blood of the lamb.
[11:15] Oh, how great was the debt that I owed
[11:24] about to pay through the seeds I have
[11:29] sown.
[11:33] But in Jesus
[11:35] my Lord, what great treasure I have
[11:40] found.
[11:42] I'm redeemed
[11:43] by the blood of the lamb.
[11:49] Hallelujah. Made in full by the blood of
[11:55] the lamb.

[25:10] Because God is good. We aren't always,
[25:13] but he always is good. Amen. Praise the
[25:16] Lord. If you have your Bible, turn to
[25:18] the book of Matthew, chapter 20. Amen.
[25:20] Thank you for all that worship. Brother
[25:22] Ken and then Matthew chapter 20.
[25:27] We'll just begin reading the first
[25:28] verse.
[25:33] For the kingdom of heaven is like unto a
[25:35] man that is a householder, which went
[25:38] out early in the morning to hire
[25:39] laborers into his vineyard. And when he
[25:42] had agreed with the laborers for a penny
[25:43] a day, he sent them into his vineyard.
[25:47] And he went out about the third hour,
[25:49] and saw others standing idle in the
[25:52] marketplace, and said unto them, "Go you
[25:55] also into the vineyard, and whatsoever
[25:57] is right, I will give you." and they
[25:59] went their way. Again he went out about
[26:02] the sixth hour and 9th hour and did
[26:04] likewise. And about the 11th hour he
[26:07] went out and found others standing idle
[26:10] and said unto them, Why stand you here
[26:13] all the day idle? They said unto him,
[26:17] because no man hath hired us, he said
[26:19] unto them, Go you also into the
[26:21] vineyard, for whatsoever is right, that
[26:24] shall you receive. So when evening was
[26:27] come, the Lord of the vineyard said unto
[26:30] his steward, Call the laborers, and give
[26:33] them their hire, beginning from the last
[26:36] unto the first. And when they came that
[26:39] were hired about the 11th hour, they
[26:41] received every man a penny. But when the
[26:44] first came, they supposed that they
[26:46] should have received more, and they
[26:48] likewise received every man a penny. And
[26:51] when they had received it, they murmured
[26:53] against the good man of the house,
[26:55] saying, These last have wrought but one
[26:58] hour, and thou hast made them equal unto
[27:00] us, which have borne the burden of the
[27:03] heat of the day. But he answered one of
[27:06] them, and said, friend, I do thee no
[27:08] wrong. Did thou didst not thou agree
[27:12] with me for a penny? Take that thine is,
[27:16] and go thy way. I will give unto this
[27:19] last even as unto thee.
[27:22] &gt;&gt; It is Is it not lawful for me to do what
[27:25] I will with mine own? Is thine eye evil
[27:29] because I am good? So the last shall be
[27:32] first and the first last. For many be
[27:37] called, but few be chosen. Acts chapter
[27:41] 2. Just before you're seated, I'll just
[27:42] read our text from last Wednesday as
[27:45] we're going to be carrying that same
[27:47] burden from last Wednesday. So simple
[27:50] yet so wonderful. Aren't you glad things
[27:52] are so simple?
[27:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. And when the day of Pentecost was
[27:56] fully come, they were all with one
[27:58] accord in one place. And suddenly there
[28:02] came a sound from heaven as of a rushing
[28:04] mighty wind, and it filled all the house
[28:07] where they were seated sitting. There
[28:09] appeared unto them cloven tongues of
[28:11] like as a fire and it sat upon each of
[28:14] them and they were all filled with the
[28:17] Holy Ghost and begin to speak with other
[28:20] tongues as the spirit gave them
[28:23] utterance.
[28:24] &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus, we thank you for the reading
[28:26] of your word tonight. How we need Lord
[28:29] you to come now Jesus. We're just
[28:31] depending upon you wholly and
[28:33] completely.
[28:35] I pray Lord God that you would just make
[28:37] your self Lord comfortable and welcome
[28:40] amongst us Lord to move freely Lord and
[28:44] have liberty Jesus I pray Lord and the
[28:47] words that I speak may they not just be
[28:49] the words of my own thoughts Lord or
[28:52] things Lord that I would ponder Lord but
[28:55] may they be Lord divine words of
[28:57] inspiration God touching Lord not just
[29:00] the humanity of emotion Lord or the
[29:03] humanity of knowledge or reasoning of a
[29:06] of a mind, Lord, but may they go further
[29:09] and go down to the very soul, Lord, to
[29:12] bring a transformation. We ask it now,
[29:14] Lord God. We just ask you to come and be
[29:16] our help. We pray in Jesus Christ's
[29:19] name. Amen. You can be seated. Like to
[29:22] carry on from last Wednesday from where
[29:25] we left off. So simple yet so wonderful.
[29:28] I'll just read that slide from the first
[29:30] one. If you have that, you can just
[29:32] display it. As brother Brandham says
[29:34] this in the Ephesian church age, as like
[29:37] begets like, the true church will always
[29:40] be the one that tries to follow in the
[29:43] steps of her founders at Pentecost.
[29:46] &gt;&gt; And her messengers will follow the
[29:49] Apostle Paul, the first messenger to the
[29:52] first church age. It is that simple and
[29:55] that wonderful.
[29:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. Uh just to start here just for a
[29:59] moment. I'm just going to uh take just
[30:01] some time to just lay a foundation as
[30:04] the Lord would just help me tonight. Um
[30:06] want to just be faithful again to what
[30:08] he's laid upon our heart. And I just
[30:10] want to say a few things and that is
[30:12] that the truth has always been simple.
[30:16] In fact, it's brother Brandham who would
[30:18] preach a message right before the
[30:20] opening of the seven seals called God
[30:23] hiding himself in simplicity. And
[30:25] brother Brandham says in that message
[30:27] that God hides himself in simplicity.
[30:30] It's his title. And he also reveals
[30:32] himself in the same. Right? So he not
[30:35] just hides himself, but he also uh he
[30:39] also reveals himself in the same. So
[30:42] it's simplicity
[30:44] often that can offend restlessness. I'll
[30:48] say that again. It's simplicity
[30:51] sometimes that can offend restlessness.
[30:55] You see, restlessness is a result of
[30:58] impatience. And impatience is something
[31:02] that we all deal with. Everyone in this
[31:05] building
[31:06] &gt;&gt; deals with impatience.
[31:08] &gt;&gt; And it doesn't matter what category it
[31:10] is in your own life. You can from a very
[31:13] natural perspective be an impatient
[31:16] person. Think of just how the age that
[31:18] we live in uh today of the impatience
[31:21] that we see with people. And if we're
[31:23] not careful, we and we be honest, you
[31:26] know, friends, sometimes that impatience
[31:28] can even affect us to where we become
[31:30] impatient with others, impatient with
[31:33] ourselves, impatient with our children.
[31:36] Amen.
[31:38] &gt;&gt; Impatient with our families,
[31:40] &gt;&gt; and impatient with life. Many times this
[31:43] restlessness that we feel is because
[31:46] we've lost our the the the sense of the
[31:49] simplicity. I know this is simple but
[31:52] it's for a no pun intended. It's for a
[31:55] purpose. I'm preaching on simplicity
[31:57] because it's so simple. But often times
[32:00] that restlessness comes because we've
[32:03] lost touch with the simplicity of life
[32:07] &gt;&gt; or divine life. You see, life is not
[32:11] simple at all. Life is very complex. The
[32:14] life that you live in is a very
[32:16] complicated one from a human from a very
[32:18] natural humanistic way. Thank you,
[32:20] brother Aaron. I did start my timer.
[32:22] Don't get scared on my computer. I'm not
[32:24] just starting it right now. Amen. Praise
[32:27] the Lord. But life is can become very
[32:30] complex. And we know that that it would
[32:33] be the desire of the enemy. It would be
[32:35] the devil that would try to bring
[32:38] complication and use that the the the
[32:40] the complexity of life to take something
[32:44] that God intended to be simple. He
[32:46] intended to be easy. He intended to be
[32:49] uh uh for the uneducated. He didn't
[32:51] intend for it to be way out of reach or
[32:54] way out of your grasp. But the things of
[32:57] God, God made them simple to us. Amen.
[33:02] &gt;&gt; Even the mystery of God in this
[33:04] generation has been fully unveiled. And
[33:07] it is not the desire of God to take that
[33:10] mystery that's been simplified and make
[33:13] it complex to the layman unreachable.
[33:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:19] &gt;&gt; So it's simplicity as I said that often
[33:22] offends uh restlessness that a a
[33:25] simplicity that offends the restlessness
[33:28] and the impatience. And we become
[33:31] impatient in life, impatient with our
[33:34] progress, impatient with how where we're
[33:37] at. And that the devil will use this
[33:39] impatience in our fallen nature to even
[33:42] bring stress. He'll use it to bring
[33:45] anxiety. He'll use it to bring
[33:47] depression. Many people find themselves
[33:50] unhappy or unsatisfied or not content
[33:53] with where they are. when that
[33:54] discontentment and that unsatisfaction
[33:57] never came from the Lord, but it
[34:00] actually comes from the enemy using your
[34:03] imagination to make you think you're not
[34:05] where you should be. Your life isn't as
[34:07] far along as it should be. You'd be
[34:09] somewhere else had you done something
[34:11] different. And the devil uses all of
[34:13] this to cloud the simplicity that God
[34:16] has called us to in this generation.
[34:18] that that that that life the way that
[34:21] God looks at life is very simple.
[34:24] &gt;&gt; I'll give you the words of the Bible.
[34:26] What has he required of you, oh man? To
[34:31] love God,
[34:33] to assu to assue evil.
[34:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:35] &gt;&gt; And to seek peace. Now, that's very
[34:37] simple. What is it that he requires of
[34:40] us? Education. God doesn't require that
[34:43] at all.
[34:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:45] &gt;&gt; Great financial gain. God doesn't
[34:48] require that of us at all.
[34:51] In fact, what God requires of us is so
[34:54] simple that it could be summed up in
[34:57] just what Jesus said. I am the vine. You
[35:02] are the branches.
[35:03] &gt;&gt; And you cannot bear fruit within
[35:06] yourself. Right?
[35:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:09] &gt;&gt; But you've got to yield to the vine.
[35:11] Yield to the husbandman of the vine and
[35:14] let the Lord produce the fruit out of
[35:16] your life. Amen.
[35:18] &gt;&gt; We can become weary as I to say even
[35:21] with the Lord we can grow impatient.
[35:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:26] &gt;&gt; And people can become weary throughout
[35:29] generations. We can see examples of
[35:30] this. I can give you many in the Bible,
[35:32] many different examples of impatience.
[35:35] It was actually Moses when he delayed
[35:38] from coming down from the mountain that
[35:40] the people, the Bible says, got
[35:41] impatient uh waiting on the voice of the
[35:44] Lord. And so rather than waiting on the
[35:48] voice of the Lord, they just made up
[35:50] their own God. They made up their own
[35:52] golden calf and and they took gold,
[35:55] which was a blessing that God had
[35:57] actually given them when they left
[35:59] Egypt, and used it to craft a false
[36:02] image, and call it called it the God who
[36:05] brought them out of Egypt. Go read it.
[36:07] It's in your Bible.
[36:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. And so impatience leads people to
[36:13] take things that God meant as blessings
[36:16] and turn them into idolatry. And instead
[36:20] of waiting on the voice of the Lord to
[36:23] speak, they make something flashy,
[36:26] golden
[36:27] &gt;&gt; and then call that truth when it wasn't
[36:29] truth. It was man's imagination.
[36:32] &gt;&gt; It was Saul's impatience in 1st Samuel
[36:35] 13. I almost preached on this tonight
[36:37] and took a totally different direction
[36:39] and the Lord just uh brought me back to
[36:41] where I'm at here tonight. But uh this
[36:42] was a lot of my inspiration in 1st
[36:45] Samuel 13 actually reading it just all
[36:47] day today. But it was incredible because
[36:49] this was the first test true test uh of
[36:52] Saul. I should say the first failure
[36:54] that really if you study the life of
[36:56] Saul his life didn't start out in
[36:59] failure. In fact, it started out with
[37:01] with uh you know a great a man who loved
[37:05] the Lord, who uh you know wanted to do
[37:08] what was right. Saul was not an evil
[37:10] man. Saul had a desire to be a king that
[37:13] that that would lead according to the
[37:16] ways of God and would be obedient to the
[37:17] Lord. But you if you notice the turning
[37:20] point in his life or his be the
[37:22] beginning of his downfall was actually
[37:25] uh there in 1st Samuel 13 when Saul was
[37:28] told to wait for Samuel who I think the
[37:31] Bible says he would be gone for seven
[37:33] days that at the end of those seven days
[37:36] uh s Sam Samuel would return to Saul but
[37:39] here was here was uh Saul and he was
[37:41] surrounded by the Philistines and and
[37:43] and it looks like he's going to get
[37:45] overrun. Their chariots are coming. In
[37:47] fact, reading it today, you could almost
[37:49] relate to Saul and say, "Man, I could
[37:51] sort of see why he got it, I mean, sort
[37:54] started to get worried. It looked like
[37:55] he was going to be wiped out." I mean,
[37:57] here was the Philistine army and even
[37:59] his own soldiers are sort of peeking
[38:01] out, ducking out and running and and
[38:03] deserting Saul and his number shrink and
[38:05] it and here's this, "But here was a word
[38:07] from the Lord. Saul, don't don't don't
[38:10] act. All I've called you to do is to
[38:13] wait." You know, obedience sometimes all
[38:16] the Lord's calling us to do is wait, not
[38:19] to act.
[38:21] &gt;&gt; I I know that there's times in our life,
[38:22] but the prophet of God said when Moses
[38:24] had to, you know, speak unto the
[38:27] children of Israel and not just stand
[38:29] here and and and and cry. Why cry? You
[38:32] speak. And so, there's times in your
[38:34] life when the Lord is not wanting you to
[38:36] wait, but wanting you to move forward.
[38:38] But can I just say that that many times
[38:40] the obedience the Lord is looking for is
[38:43] for us just to be patient.
[38:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[38:48] &gt;&gt; And wait on the Lord.
[38:50] &gt;&gt; Oh yes.
[38:52] &gt;&gt; But Saul gets ahead of God. It looked
[38:53] like the enemy was closing in. He
[38:55] offers. He finally, you know, just can't
[38:58] wait anymore. Here's the here's the
[39:00] almost the end of the seven days of
[39:02] waiting before Samuel the prophet
[39:05] returns and makes a sacrifice. And then
[39:06] he calls priest. He makes a sacrifice
[39:08] and and Saul Samuel shows up and says,
[39:12] "You've done a horrible thing, Saul. But
[39:15] Lord, I was but but Samuel, I was
[39:18] surrounded. We were about to be overrun,
[39:20] but all God asks you to do is wait."
[39:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:27] &gt;&gt; Abraham and Hagar, we know I got a lot
[39:29] of these written down. God promises a
[39:32] son to Abraham, but the wait was long.
[39:36] And instead of resting in the simplicity
[39:38] of that promise, Abraham and Sarah both
[39:41] devised a plan to, you know, help God
[39:44] out.
[39:47] &gt;&gt; And how many times have we found oursel
[39:49] in that same spot where God has given us
[39:52] a word from the Lord and we've believed
[39:55] it, but after time runs its course, we
[39:57] become impatient with the Lord and we
[40:00] just want to help God out
[40:03] &gt;&gt; and it produces an Ishmael every single
[40:05] time.
[40:06] Amen.
[40:07] &gt;&gt; And here's Ishmael, a work of the flesh
[40:10] that brought strife. It didn't bring
[40:12] peace.
[40:14] And so, I could just say it this way.
[40:16] When you don't wait on the promise that
[40:19] God makes you, uh, as Abraham and Sarah
[40:23] did, you you will end up birthing your
[40:26] own man-made attempt that will just
[40:29] bring strife and complications. And it
[40:31] lasted generations even still today.
[40:35] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen.
[40:36] &gt;&gt; You can think of the Galatians in
[40:38] Galatians 3:1 when Paul comes to them
[40:41] and and you know the scripture very
[40:42] well. He said, "Having you having begun
[40:44] in the spirit, are you now perfected by
[40:47] the flesh?"
[40:49] &gt;&gt; In other words, you began in the
[40:51] simplicity of go you into the upper
[40:54] room, wait ye in Jerusalem until you be
[40:57] endued with with power.
[41:00] Amen.
[41:01] &gt;&gt; You imagine I I could imagine the
[41:03] impatience that you could grow when but
[41:05] the only word you had from the Lord was
[41:08] to wait.
[41:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:11] &gt;&gt; Power was going to come, but they had to
[41:13] first wait on the Lord.
[41:16] &gt;&gt; I love how brother Brandon says it. He
[41:18] says, you know what they began to do
[41:19] while they were waiting? They didn't get
[41:21] impatient. They didn't say, "Where's the
[41:23] Lord? We're waiting." But here's all we
[41:25] know is Jesus said to wait until the
[41:27] promise of my father which say he you
[41:30] shall receive power after that the Holy
[41:32] Ghost has come upon you. And the prophet
[41:33] of God picks it up and said you know
[41:35] what they started to do in that upper
[41:37] room in that moment of waiting. In that
[41:39] moment when it didn't look like God was
[41:40] doing anything in that moment when it
[41:43] didn't make a lot of sense brother
[41:44] Brandon said they started worshiping the
[41:46] Lord. They got in one mind and one
[41:49] accord and started worshiping the Lord
[41:51] for what he had not yet sent. In other
[41:54] words, you can start to praise the Lord
[41:57] for what you don't even yet have.
[42:01] &gt;&gt; And the prophet of God said when they
[42:02] got to that place, then there came a
[42:04] sound like a rushing mighty wind. Yes.
[42:07] Amen.
[42:07] &gt;&gt; You can think of these examples all the
[42:10] way when Jesus says to wait to to to be
[42:13] obedient to wait in 2 Corinthians chap
[42:16] 11. I think it's verse three. You know
[42:18] the scripture very well from uh when
[42:20] you're teaching on the original sin. And
[42:23] the apostle Paul says, "But I fear lest
[42:26] by any means as the serpent beguiled Eve
[42:30] &gt;&gt; so your minds should be corrupted." What
[42:33] does he say? From the simplicity
[42:39] &gt;&gt; that is in Christ. Is that what the
[42:41] Bible says? How many believe that?
[42:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:45] &gt;&gt; Even second Timothy when they and I you
[42:48] to say, "Brother Matt, what are you
[42:49] preaching on?" The simplicity of the
[42:51] gospel that it's so simple. So simple
[42:54] &gt;&gt; yet so wonderful. And if and and and I
[42:57] could imagine that there was a great
[42:58] pressure even for Noah. You imagine
[43:01] after preaching the same message for a
[43:04] hundred to all of you that want to
[43:05] complain on the pastor or the preacher
[43:07] preaching part nine and part 10 and part
[43:09] 14 and part 19 and part 25
[43:13] some pastors you know brother Donnie
[43:15] part n 633 I don't know that he makes
[43:18] that many but
[43:20] I tell you what Noah preached that same
[43:22] message for 120 years
[43:26] &gt;&gt; you imagine the the impatience that that
[43:28] that that that grew grew within the
[43:30] people. Come on, Noah. You've been
[43:32] preaching the same thing for the past 50
[43:35] years. Ain't you got no new inspiration?
[43:38] Don't you ever hear anything else from
[43:40] the Lord. But you know what Noah knew?
[43:42] God gave him a word and all God asks him
[43:45] to do was be faithful to what he
[43:47] promised.
[43:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:49] &gt;&gt; To not over complicate it. Come on,
[43:51] somebody help me preach. To not try to
[43:53] reinterpret it or reinvent it. Just say
[43:56] what the Lord told you to say, brother,
[43:59] and let the rest be up to God. Don't try
[44:02] to over complicate the gospel. Listen to
[44:04] me, friends. What we've received is not
[44:06] a complex, complicated, untainable,
[44:09] unattainable, ununderstandable truth.
[44:12] But it's simple to understand. And all
[44:14] God asks you to do is believe it the way
[44:16] he spoke it. Don't try to change it.
[44:18] Don't try to add to it or take from it.
[44:21] &gt;&gt; Just preach it the way it was delivered.
[44:24] Amen.
[44:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. Can you say
[44:26] &gt;&gt; amen?
[44:28] &gt;&gt; Uh they they'll not even in in in in 2
[44:30] Timothy 4:3, I know you know the
[44:32] scripture that they will not endure
[44:34] sound doctrine, but after their own
[44:36] lust, they shall turn their ears from
[44:38] the truth and be turned unto fable. So
[44:41] this was the danger of of failing to
[44:44] wait. And this is just my burden. I I I
[44:47] I felt like last Wednesday I really
[44:49] couldn't express it the way the Lord
[44:51] gave it to me. And it's I keep wanting
[44:53] to say it's so simple, but that's my
[44:56] title.
[44:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:00] &gt;&gt; That it's so that we if we that what I I
[45:03] I'm afraid that we can do with the truth
[45:07] and the truth that we've received is
[45:09] because of impatience of not seeing what
[45:12] we thought would be the result.
[45:15] You know, then we go to try to brother
[45:17] Brandham said this about those who would
[45:19] say the days of miracles are passed and
[45:21] the prophet said they have to say that
[45:24] because when you are confronted with the
[45:26] miraculous
[45:28] &gt;&gt; you have to make a choice either you you
[45:31] you you ask the Lord why why don't I see
[45:35] the miraculous that I see even in his
[45:37] own ministry. So you had men and
[45:39] ministers who didn't have the gifts
[45:42] operating didn't have a gift like that
[45:43] operating in their ministry. So they had
[45:44] a choice, one of two things. Either they
[45:46] would admit that they don't have it and
[45:48] then cling to the word of the hour and
[45:50] follow the word of the hour or say that
[45:52] the days of miracles are passed and we
[45:54] don't need that anymore.
[45:57] &gt;&gt; Just just for a moment, just ponder that
[45:59] here for a minute that when we don't
[46:02] when we don't see what we think we
[46:04] should see, then we have a choice. And
[46:07] we can, if we're not careful, go in a
[46:09] direction to say, "Well, maybe, you
[46:11] know, maybe maybe it wasn't for us.
[46:14] Maybe it was for somebody else.
[46:16] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[46:17] &gt;&gt; Maybe it was for another generation."
[46:19] And so we we move from the simplicity.
[46:22] People can grow weary waiting on the
[46:25] Lord. And in their impatience, as we see
[46:28] from the scripture, can begin to
[46:30] fabricate ideas, doctrines,
[46:33] &gt;&gt; experiences
[46:35] &gt;&gt; that are not grounded in the word.
[46:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:39] &gt;&gt; They walk away from the simplicity of
[46:42] Christ. Even when Jesus says, "Terry the
[46:44] city of Jerusalem until you be undoed."
[46:47] But you know, the problem is is that
[46:49] right there with that word,
[46:51] &gt;&gt; Terry.
[46:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:53] &gt;&gt; We don't like to terry. That's right.
[46:55] Amen.
[46:56] &gt;&gt; Come on, let's go.
[46:58] &gt;&gt; Let's get this thing moving.
[47:00] &gt;&gt; But he said, Terry, we want to move. We
[47:03] want to act. We want to feel. We want to
[47:05] do. And many times we get ahead of God.
[47:08] We run without being sent. We speak
[47:13] without hearing first.
[47:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:20] &gt;&gt; Can I just unburden my heart here?
[47:24] Listen to what brotherham says. This I
[47:25] love this so much. And now that man
[47:28] coming to Jesus, listen to this. Coming
[47:30] to Christ today in the coming through
[47:32] the blood. I love this. Comes into the
[47:35] blood cell. He's talking about this here
[47:38] um
[47:39] in the sill of of of Christ. The man
[47:42] coming to Jesus Christ today coming
[47:44] through the blood comes into the blood
[47:46] cell in fellowship by the Holy Spirit.
[47:48] Don't you just love that? You come into
[47:51] the blood cell by fellowship with the
[47:54] Holy Spirit.
[47:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:55] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon says that God, what did
[47:57] he said? Emanuel took and wrapped
[47:59] himself around a blood cell and the and
[48:01] here was what brother Brandon has
[48:02] wrapped himself in a in a blood cell.
[48:05] Not cells, but the blood cell
[48:07] &gt;&gt; and becomes a part of God. Has God's
[48:10] life in him becomes a son and daughter
[48:13] of God. It's just as impossible for that
[48:16] man to be lost as it is for God himself
[48:20] to be lost.
[48:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:22] &gt;&gt; For I will give them everlasting life.
[48:24] Everlasting comes from the Greek word
[48:26] Zoey. God's own life. God's life is in
[48:29] the individual and you're sealed by it
[48:32] until the day of redemption. That's the
[48:36] seal of God. And when you do, you become
[48:40] Christlike.
[48:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:43] You love those that hate you.
[48:47] &gt;&gt; You're for one purpose, to do the will
[48:50] of the father. Bring in all the
[48:52] brothers. Put your arms around your
[48:54] enemies and love them.
[48:57] &gt;&gt; And the great works of the Holy Spirit.
[49:00] Oh wow. So you mean the great works of
[49:02] the Holy Spirit is not casting out
[49:04] devils and casting out demons and
[49:07] opening blind eyes. Hello.
[49:10] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen. The great works is to put
[49:13] your arm around your enemies and love
[49:16] them.
[49:18] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[49:18] &gt;&gt; The great works, as brother Brandham
[49:21] says, you love those that hate you.
[49:23] You're for one purpose.
[49:25] &gt;&gt; Bring in all the brothers. Read it
[49:26] again. Put your arms around your enemies
[49:27] and love them. And the great works of
[49:29] the Holy Spirit. Rejoice not in
[49:31] iniquity, but rejoice in truth.
[49:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. This is what you have when you
[49:37] have that nature of Christ living inside
[49:40] of you. As brother Brandham says, you
[49:42] come into that blood cell by fellowship
[49:45] with the Holy Ghost. And he says, then
[49:48] you have eternal life. God's own life.
[49:50] God's life is in the individual. You're
[49:53] sealed into the day of redemption. You
[49:55] become Christlike.
[49:58] What do you have? You have the nature of
[50:00] the lamb living through your humanity.
[50:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:05] I want that in my life.
[50:08] &gt;&gt; I I I I dwell on this just for a moment
[50:11] even today that that this was the words
[50:13] of in John chapter 15. I I just if you
[50:17] have your Bible, you can read them with
[50:18] me or that I won't have them take that
[50:20] down just because I'll get to back to it
[50:22] too too quickly. But Jesus says, "I am
[50:24] the vine." You know this very well. You
[50:26] are the branch. I'm sorry. I am the vine
[50:29] and my father is the husbandman. This is
[50:31] John 15. Every branch in me that beareth
[50:34] not fruit, he taketh away. And every
[50:37] branch that beareth fruit, he purgeth
[50:40] it, that it may bring forth more fruit.
[50:45] &gt;&gt; So what is one of God's great concerns
[50:47] for our life?
[50:50] Miracles,
[50:52] raising the dead.
[50:55] You say, "Brother Matt, are you against
[50:56] any of those things?" No. I believe God
[50:58] can perform a miracle. He did in my
[51:00] life. Amen.
[51:02] &gt;&gt; Every one of you that are here today
[51:04] that have a love for the word of God in
[51:05] your heart, you're a miracle.
[51:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:10] &gt;&gt; But notice in John 15, he doesn't say,
[51:12] "Every branch that doesn't perform the
[51:14] supernatural, I'll cut it off."
[51:17] &gt;&gt; But here's what he said. Every branch
[51:19] that doesn't bear fruit.
[51:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:24] &gt;&gt; He says, I I I beareth fruit. He purgth
[51:27] it that it may bring forth more fruit.
[51:31] If a man abide not in me, he is cast
[51:34] forth as a branch and is withered and
[51:36] men gather them and cast them into the
[51:38] fire and they are burned. What a warning
[51:42] from the Lord
[51:43] &gt;&gt; that this is actually what he's saying
[51:45] that bearing fruit is actually not
[51:49] optional.
[51:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:52] But the husbandman watches over his
[51:55] vine.
[51:56] He watches over his branches and all the
[51:59] branches that are connected to that
[52:01] vine. And and and with great jealousy,
[52:06] the Bible says, "And with great concern
[52:09] that those branches sprang forth Christ
[52:13] like fruit."
[52:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:16] &gt;&gt; And he patiently patient. Oh, I'm so
[52:19] glad that as impatient as I can be on
[52:21] the Lord, he he's patient with me.
[52:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:25] &gt;&gt; He patiently waits for the branches to
[52:29] bring forth more fruit. He stands beside
[52:32] it with a pruning knife of your life.
[52:34] And anything that comes, if you're a
[52:36] real son of Abraham, a real son of God,
[52:38] daughter of God, listen friends, God
[52:41] won't let you. He might let others and
[52:42] they might get away with it, but he
[52:44] won't let you get away with it. and
[52:47] anything in your life that doesn't bring
[52:49] forth fruit. The nature of Christ, he
[52:52] stands by with a pruning knife ready to
[52:55] cut away anything that is bringing death
[52:59] to the vine. I'm glad I It doesn't feel
[53:01] comfortable. It it it's maybe not what I
[53:04] always like, but but overall at the end
[53:06] of the road, I promise I'll be thankful
[53:09] that I had a patient husband, one who
[53:11] wouldn't let me not bear fruit in my
[53:13] life, but pruned off anything that was
[53:16] unlike him. Amen.
[53:19] &gt;&gt; He he he stands there with with a knife
[53:22] waiting, watching for the slightest
[53:25] evidence of corruption,
[53:29] &gt;&gt; disease, anything to the plant that
[53:31] would cause it to not grow properly. And
[53:34] friends, there are so many things that
[53:36] we can take in that hinder growth.
[53:43] &gt;&gt; But God expects fruit. without fruit.
[53:45] It's actually to be this is this is what
[53:48] Jesus said. Herein is my father
[53:50] glorified
[53:52] that you bear much fruit. That's verse
[53:54] eight. Here in my father glorified that
[53:58] you bear much fruit.
[54:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:02] &gt;&gt; So shall you be my disciples.
[54:06] How many want to please God?
[54:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:10] &gt;&gt; How many want to live a life pleasing to
[54:12] God?
[54:14] You see, we thought that being pleasing
[54:16] to God was to, you know, have great uh,
[54:18] you know, powerful stories and
[54:21] testimonies and send us on the mission
[54:23] field and come back and testify of our
[54:25] meetings and testify of how many a blind
[54:28] eyes were. I listen, I I do that, too,
[54:30] and I'm glad for it.
[54:33] &gt;&gt; But what God's looking for, many will
[54:36] come to me in that day saying, "Lord,
[54:37] Lord, have we not done many wonderful
[54:39] works
[54:41] &gt;&gt; in your name?
[54:43] But what he's looking for is fruits.
[54:47] &gt;&gt; You say, "What kind of fruits?" Fruits
[54:49] that match the word,
[54:51] &gt;&gt; right?
[54:52] And so he says with, he says, "You have
[54:55] not chose me." This is verse 16. "But I
[54:57] have chosen you and ordained you that
[54:59] you should go and bring forth fruit and
[55:03] that your fruit should remain. For
[55:06] whatsoever you shall ask in my father's
[55:09] name, he may give it to you." you.
[55:12] Aren't you glad he's going to give it to
[55:13] us?
[55:15] &gt;&gt; And so, it's amazing because this is
[55:17] this is exactly what the Lord is saying.
[55:19] I just want to go through some of this
[55:20] in Matthew chapter 21. We read from
[55:22] Matthew 20, but he this is what he he
[55:25] speaks of a and he and he says he says
[55:28] that he taketh away, he prunes it even
[55:31] when he sees the fig tree that's barren
[55:33] and and and he sees that fig tree and he
[55:35] curses the life. He found no fruit on
[55:37] that tree. And he found leaves but no
[55:40] fruit. Right? And so so he says he says
[55:44] here when he saw a fig tree in the way
[55:47] he came to it and found nothing thereon
[55:49] but leaves only and said unto it lo
[55:54] on thee henceforth forever and presently
[55:57] the fig tree withered away. You know
[56:00] what he could do? He could see what no
[56:01] other eye could see. He could see a
[56:03] disease. Well everybody else looked at
[56:04] that tree and maybe thought it was
[56:05] perfectly healthy seen leaves. But Jesus
[56:08] seen further. He seen a corruption or a
[56:10] death that had set in on that tree
[56:13] and said to it, "Let no fruit grow from
[56:16] thee again, because disease lays beneath
[56:19] the bark, and there's death in that
[56:22] disease." Notice he didn't curse. What
[56:24] he cursed was the death that was in what
[56:27] appeared to be life.
[56:30] You see, this is what he says when when
[56:32] he tells us to have righteous judgment
[56:35] that by their fruits you shall know them
[56:38] by what they produce. Not what you say,
[56:40] not what you even externally live, but
[56:43] what you are, who you are. That's the
[56:45] fruit God will judge us by. And so he
[56:48] says here that that you may bear more
[56:51] fruit. So say, brother Matt, what kind
[56:53] of fruit are you talking about? This
[56:54] kind of fruit right here.
[56:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. that put your arms around your
[56:57] enemy and love them and the great works
[57:00] of the Holy Spirit. Rejoice not in
[57:02] iniquity but rejoice in truth.
[57:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:08] &gt;&gt; We we know these from Galatians chapter
[57:11] 5 and and we won't take all the time
[57:13] just here just as much time as the Lord
[57:14] will before we go on to the next one. I
[57:17] just want to feel that I've I've said
[57:19] what the Lord wanted me to say in
[57:21] Galatians 5:22. Turn there if you could.
[57:24] Galatians 5:22.
[57:27] We'll just read just a few verses from
[57:29] this. And he says, "But the fruit of the
[57:31] spirit is love, joy, peace,
[57:36] longsuffering, gentleness, goodness,
[57:40] faith, meekness, temperance. Against
[57:45] such there is no law. And they that are
[57:47] in Christ have crucified the flesh with
[57:49] the affections and lust. If we live in
[57:51] the spirit, let us also walk in the
[57:55] spirit. So these were the fruits that he
[57:57] talks about. And I'm just going to read
[57:59] you a few things that brother random
[58:00] said that I thought were just so good in
[58:03] connection to this. And and and and
[58:05] we'll just take just some time just here
[58:07] for a moment. But but I I want you to
[58:10] see that that it was the prophet of God
[58:12] would make this statement. You you might
[58:14] speak in tongues.
[58:16] &gt;&gt; You might, you might not. Amen.
[58:20] &gt;&gt; But here's one thing you will have. You
[58:23] will have evident fruit.
[58:27] &gt;&gt; Evident fruit.
[58:31] Love. We know that word is that word
[58:34] agape. Not the love like we think of
[58:36] from the world, but actually agape love.
[58:40] Christ's own love. The love of God. Not
[58:43] the love of man. That'll fail. The love
[58:45] of affection. That'll fail. That's only
[58:48] temporary.
[58:49] But true charity, true love, true love
[58:52] from the love of God only is imparted to
[58:56] us supernaturally by the Holy Ghost. In
[58:59] fact, you can't humanly have the right
[59:02] kind of love for your wife or a wife or
[59:04] her husband unless the Holy Spirit
[59:08] through you projects that love that a
[59:11] love beyond mistake, love beyond
[59:13] failure, love beyond faults because
[59:15] there's many of them. And it's him. And
[59:17] you say, "Brother Matt, I got to love my
[59:19] brother." You could never love your
[59:21] enemy.
[59:22] &gt;&gt; Because most of us can't even love our
[59:25] brother.
[59:27] &gt;&gt; And Jesus said, "How can you love, you
[59:29] know, love the ones that you say you
[59:30] love the one God that you don't see, but
[59:32] you don't love the ones that you you
[59:34] hate the ones that you do see?"
[59:37] &gt;&gt; So you say, "How would it happen?" By
[59:39] the indwelling of the Holy Ghost. Love
[59:41] comes from God and God alone. The Holy
[59:44] Ghost is the love of God. Listen to what
[59:46] brother Brandham says here. I can prove
[59:48] it by the Bible. Though I speak with the
[59:50] tongue of men and angels and have not
[59:52] love, it profits me nothing. If you want
[59:54] to know what I think the evidence of the
[59:56] Holy Ghost is, it's love. No matter what
[59:59] else, you can scream, shout, do whatever
[1:00:01] you want to. If you haven't got love,
[1:00:04] Paul said you've got nothing. I know
[1:00:06] people love to just stop on this quote
[1:00:09] and say, "Well, Brother Brandon almost
[1:00:10] corrected, Brother Matt. The evidence of
[1:00:11] the Holy Ghost is not love." Well,
[1:00:13] that's right. It's not the evidence, but
[1:00:15] it is a evidence.
[1:00:19] &gt;&gt; Should have got a bigger amen than that.
[1:00:22] &gt;&gt; Yeah, I know that brother Brandon was
[1:00:24] corrected in love. Brother Brandon says,
[1:00:25] "Love, Christian Science, loves
[1:00:27] everybody, gives to the poor, feeds the
[1:00:28] widow, you know, takes care of the
[1:00:30] hungry." And he says they they don't
[1:00:31] even believe in the divinity of Christ.
[1:00:33] But it's not to diminish or to take away
[1:00:36] what he did say about true love. In
[1:00:38] fact, it would be that same prophet on
[1:00:40] the uh beyond the curtain of time that
[1:00:42] would come back with this declaration.
[1:00:45] Whatever you do, uh make sure you you
[1:00:47] you don't miss perfect love. Get to the
[1:00:50] place where you can love everybody.
[1:00:51] That's what he said. Is that not what he
[1:00:53] said? Get to the place where you even
[1:00:55] love your enemy
[1:00:56] &gt;&gt; because nothing will enter there outside
[1:00:59] of divine love. I say, God, I want that
[1:01:01] in my life. I want the the real love of
[1:01:04] Christ
[1:01:06] &gt;&gt; to come and project itself through me
[1:01:08] where I can love anybody.
[1:01:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:12] &gt;&gt; Doesn't mean you got to agree with them.
[1:01:13] Doesn't mean you got to just just accept
[1:01:15] them. You you know true true true love
[1:01:19] will tell them that they're wrong.
[1:01:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:22] &gt;&gt; You say, "How can you say that, brother
[1:01:24] Matt?" Because if you really believed in
[1:01:26] God, then you really believe in a
[1:01:28] heaven. And if you really believe in a
[1:01:30] heaven, then you really believe in a
[1:01:31] hell.
[1:01:33] &gt;&gt; And if you really believe in a hell and
[1:01:35] you know someone is on their way there,
[1:01:38] true love will commend them. We'll
[1:01:40] command them. We'll plead with them.
[1:01:41] Don't ever end up there, brother.
[1:01:43] There's a better way. There's a better
[1:01:45] life. God can free you and set you free.
[1:01:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:49] &gt;&gt; False love says, "Oh, you know, I don't
[1:01:51] want to hurt their feelings. I don't
[1:01:53] want to, you know, be make it
[1:01:54] uncomfortable and make it awkward." And
[1:01:55] you know that's not true love friends.
[1:01:59] &gt;&gt; True love tells the truth.
[1:02:03] &gt;&gt; True love is honest. I don't know why
[1:02:06] I'm here man but I am not able to get
[1:02:08] away from it.
[1:02:10] &gt;&gt; True love will tell the truth in love
[1:02:13] but it will tell the truth.
[1:02:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:16] &gt;&gt; It is not love to just say nothing.
[1:02:20] Amen.
[1:02:21] &gt;&gt; When you see sin, when you see a person
[1:02:23] going down a path of of sin and chains
[1:02:27] of darkness, it is not love just to pray
[1:02:30] for them silently and never let the love
[1:02:33] of God project through you to to give
[1:02:36] them the truth. Tell them the gospel.
[1:02:38] Tell them what the Bible says.
[1:02:41] &gt;&gt; I'm so glad I had somebody in my life
[1:02:43] that could could say it with love, in
[1:02:46] love, brother, this is what the Bible
[1:02:47] says. This is what the word of God
[1:02:49] promises. The way that you're going is a
[1:02:51] path to destruction. Oh, but there's a
[1:02:53] hope. There's a better life. There's a
[1:02:55] way out of that prison. There's a man
[1:02:57] who can break the chains of your life.
[1:03:00] His name is Jesus.
[1:03:02] &gt;&gt; That's true love.
[1:03:05] Joy. The Bible says, "Joy, restore to me
[1:03:08] the joy." This one, Brother Brandon
[1:03:10] says, "I love this." Now, David had not
[1:03:12] lost his salvation. This is the words of
[1:03:14] David. Restore to me the joy of my
[1:03:17] salvation. Brother Adam says, "David had
[1:03:19] not lost his salvation, but the joy of
[1:03:22] it."
[1:03:24] &gt;&gt; And when it comes to a place that I
[1:03:26] cannot enjoy my religion, there's
[1:03:29] something wrong somewhere because it's
[1:03:32] joy unspeakable and full of glory.
[1:03:37] &gt;&gt; Come on, friends. When we got to be
[1:03:38] begged to worship God, that's only
[1:03:40] because our hearts have grown cold.
[1:03:43] Amen.
[1:03:44] &gt;&gt; When we've got to be begged to come to
[1:03:46] church, it's only because if we'd be
[1:03:48] honest, our hearts have gotten cold. We
[1:03:50] haven't. You say, "Brother man, have we
[1:03:51] lost our salvation?" No, but you might
[1:03:53] have lost the joy of your salvation.
[1:03:55] Because real salvation comes with joy,
[1:03:58] unspeakable, and full of glory. When you
[1:04:00] got to be to say amen to the word of
[1:04:02] God, it ain't the preacher's fault. It
[1:04:04] ain't God's fault. It's it's our own
[1:04:07] lazy spiritual carnal lazy condition
[1:04:10] that we got to with rubbing our
[1:04:12] shoulders with the world. We ought to
[1:04:13] have something inside of us. Even when
[1:04:16] we don't feel good, even when the day
[1:04:18] didn't go good, when everything might be
[1:04:20] going against us, yet we can say, "God,
[1:04:22] you are still worthy of my praise. You
[1:04:25] are still worthy of my of my worship,
[1:04:28] Lord."
[1:04:29] &gt;&gt; In fact, it's true worship that comes
[1:04:32] when it's you're not feeling good. You
[1:04:33] don't feel up to. You don't feel like
[1:04:35] it. I tell you what, that's when you
[1:04:36] really can worship the Lord. It's when
[1:04:38] you don't feel I don't feel worthy. Real
[1:04:41] worship comes when you don't really feel
[1:04:43] worthy because it ain't never been about
[1:04:44] you and it never will be about you. But
[1:04:47] I tell you what true worship will do. It
[1:04:49] will break the grip of the enemy out of
[1:04:51] your life. It'll break the grip of
[1:04:53] depression in your life.
[1:04:55] &gt;&gt; You want to know what it'll break the
[1:04:56] power of darkness? Worship the Lord.
[1:05:00] It set Paul free in a prison when he was
[1:05:03] bound with chains and he began to
[1:05:05] worship from his own prison.
[1:05:10] &gt;&gt; It was Judah who was called what did his
[1:05:12] name even Judah? His name means praise.
[1:05:17] &gt;&gt; Oh, we ought to get back to the to the
[1:05:19] what the Bible says around the sixth
[1:05:21] hour Jesus visited a well by said I must
[1:05:24] go by the way of Samaria. And what did
[1:05:26] Jesus tell her? I'm searching those
[1:05:29] looking for those who who worship me in
[1:05:32] spirit and in truth.
[1:05:34] &gt;&gt; You say, "I got the spirit." Hello. I've
[1:05:36] got the truth. Then it will produce
[1:05:39] worship.
[1:05:40] &gt;&gt; I said the spirit and the truth will
[1:05:42] produce true worship.
[1:05:46] &gt;&gt; That Judah's name meant worship. His
[1:05:48] name I thought about that today. His
[1:05:50] name meant praise.
[1:05:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's literally in fact you go read
[1:05:54] it when he his name there and God says
[1:05:57] Judah your name shall be Judah which
[1:05:59] mean pra which means praise and he says
[1:06:01] and your hand will be on the neck of
[1:06:04] your enemy. Notice what he's saying
[1:06:06] about worship and about praise. That
[1:06:08] worship and praise puts your hand on the
[1:06:11] neck of your enemy. And it's not like I
[1:06:14] looked it up. It's not like this. It's
[1:06:16] actually like this to put on the back of
[1:06:18] the head and make it bow down unto you.
[1:06:21] Listen, you want to know how to make
[1:06:22] your depression bow down? Start
[1:06:24] worshiping the Lord. Put your praise on
[1:06:27] the neck of that devil and say, "Satan,
[1:06:30] you got to bow down to the name of
[1:06:31] Jesus." Depression, you will bow at the
[1:06:35] name of worship and at the sound of
[1:06:37] praise. All the chains that Satan tries
[1:06:39] to put on me can be broken and loosed in
[1:06:42] Jesus' name.
[1:06:43] &gt;&gt; That's what true worship will do. It'll
[1:06:46] make the devil bow down to you.
[1:06:49] &gt;&gt; That was free. It wasn't on my notes,
[1:06:54] but this is what true joy. Brother
[1:06:56] Brandham says, "Restore to me the joy of
[1:06:58] my salvation." It's joy. Listen what he
[1:07:01] says. One scripture said, "Taste and see
[1:07:05] that the Lord is good. It tastes like
[1:07:07] honey in the rock." Brother, I'm so glad
[1:07:10] I have tasted that the Lord is good.
[1:07:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:16] &gt;&gt; One of the fruits is peace. Peace.
[1:07:18] Listen to this. Prophet of God says,
[1:07:22] "And in all this time, you'll certainly
[1:07:24] above everything bear the fruit of the
[1:07:26] spirit."
[1:07:28] &gt;&gt; There's one sure thing you will do.
[1:07:31] Says, "Is your life worthy of the
[1:07:32] gospel?" There's one sure thing you will
[1:07:37] do. You will bear the fruit of the
[1:07:41] spirit. And the fruit of the spirit is
[1:07:43] love, joy, peace, faith, longsuffering,
[1:07:45] meekness, gentleness, patience.
[1:07:48] And this is what true peace is. Listen.
[1:07:50] Still listening. Brother man says, he
[1:07:52] says, "Christians are still outside on
[1:07:55] the first altar if you're still
[1:07:57] listening to what the neighbor will
[1:07:58] think."
[1:08:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:00] &gt;&gt; Instead, the Holy Spirit brings a life
[1:08:03] that's characterized by peace, love,
[1:08:05] joy, longsuffering, goodness,
[1:08:08] gentleness, patience. Don't fuss about
[1:08:11] the other things.
[1:08:13] &gt;&gt; Get that in your life.
[1:08:15] &gt;&gt; And you'll never get it until you're hid
[1:08:17] away with God.
[1:08:20] &gt;&gt; Listen to kindness. Be kind one to
[1:08:24] another.
[1:08:29] &gt;&gt; Be kind.
[1:08:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:31] &gt;&gt; One to another.
[1:08:33] &gt;&gt; And all the Christians say, "Okay, I can
[1:08:36] do that." Be kind to your enemies. Amen.
[1:08:41] &gt;&gt; Love everybody.
[1:08:44] No matter what they've done,
[1:08:46] &gt;&gt; love them anyhow. And if you can't do
[1:08:49] that, brother, you need to be at the
[1:08:52] altar.
[1:08:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:56] &gt;&gt; This is what brother Brandham says is
[1:08:58] true kindness leads to forgiveness. Even
[1:09:03] those who oppose us, those who hurt us.
[1:09:06] I tell you what it will do. it'll be one
[1:09:07] sure sign that it ain't you who's living
[1:09:10] anymore but Christ living in you.
[1:09:14] If a person can find themsself just to
[1:09:17] and and I can just say this here and I
[1:09:19] know it's very simple
[1:09:23] &gt;&gt; but if we ain't able friends if we ain't
[1:09:26] able to show kindness
[1:09:29] &gt;&gt; how can we call ourselves Christians
[1:09:32] &gt;&gt; would that not be the most basic
[1:09:35] fundamental evidence
[1:09:38] &gt;&gt; that you've really met the Lord
[1:09:40] &gt;&gt; is that you're a kind
[1:09:43] person
[1:09:46] kindness.
[1:09:49] Listen to what he says about goodness
[1:09:50] here. When the Holy Spirit comes into a
[1:09:52] life, he terraces off a nice big place
[1:09:57] and puts up a great big mansion
[1:10:00] &gt;&gt; and he lives there.
[1:10:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. And the flowers of love, joy,
[1:10:06] peace, longsuffering, goodness, mercies,
[1:10:11] kindness, faith are blooming all around
[1:10:14] this house. You know, we got a problem
[1:10:16] if what's growing and blooming around
[1:10:19] our house is anger and malice and
[1:10:22] jealousy and envy and strife and
[1:10:25] argument.
[1:10:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:28] &gt;&gt; I don't think we could say the Lord
[1:10:29] lives there.
[1:10:31] Somebody lives there, but it ain't the
[1:10:32] Lord.
[1:10:34] &gt;&gt; He says, why is it that so many this is
[1:10:36] in why why is it that so many Christians
[1:10:38] find it hard to live a Christian life?
[1:10:40] And so it's it's actually goodness is a
[1:10:43] garden. Goodness is a fruit that is born
[1:10:46] out of our life. Beautiful flowers,
[1:10:49] fruits blooming all around the house and
[1:10:53] they flourish in the life of a true
[1:10:56] believer. faithfulness, which we know is
[1:10:58] faith. No matter how loyal you are to
[1:11:00] anything else, be loyal to Christ.
[1:11:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:06] &gt;&gt; I'll say it again. No matter how loyal
[1:11:08] you are to anything else, be loyal to
[1:11:11] Christ.
[1:11:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:14] &gt;&gt; That's what true faithfulness is. One
[1:11:16] who holds on to faith is loyal and
[1:11:20] faithful to Christ. Amen.
[1:11:23] &gt;&gt; This is exactly what it means to have
[1:11:25] genuine faith. Faithfulness. Genuine
[1:11:29] faith. As the brother Adam says, there's
[1:11:32] only one evidence of the Holy Spirit
[1:11:33] that I know. That's a genuine faith in
[1:11:36] the promised word of the hour. That's
[1:11:39] what it means to be truly spiritfilled
[1:11:41] as you will believe the word for your
[1:11:44] hour.
[1:11:45] &gt;&gt; Gentleness, which also is what we use
[1:11:48] for meekness.
[1:11:50] Why did he choose the lamb? This is the
[1:11:52] this is the prophet of God and the lamb
[1:11:54] and the dove in 1956. Why did he choose
[1:11:57] the lamb and the dove? It's because the
[1:11:59] dove could not abide on nothing else but
[1:12:02] a lamb. Because their natures are the
[1:12:06] same.
[1:12:09] &gt;&gt; Did you catch that?
[1:12:12] &gt;&gt; The reason the dove can abide on the
[1:12:15] lamb is because their nature's the same.
[1:12:18] That tells me that if my nature does not
[1:12:21] match the nature of the Holy Spirit, it
[1:12:24] cannot abide on me.
[1:12:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:27] &gt;&gt; Their natures are the same. Their
[1:12:30] nature, the nature of a dove, the nature
[1:12:32] of a lamb, he brother says their natures
[1:12:35] were meek,
[1:12:37] &gt;&gt; humble,
[1:12:39] teachable.
[1:12:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:12:43] &gt;&gt; And lowly,
[1:12:44] and that's why they could dwell
[1:12:46] together. Now what if the lamb would
[1:12:48] have snorted like a wolf? Why? The dove
[1:12:52] would have been gone.
[1:12:54] &gt;&gt; And if we are lambs of God, we should
[1:12:56] have the nature of lambs
[1:12:59] &gt;&gt; if we expect the dove to abide.
[1:13:06] &gt;&gt; This is what it means to have the seal
[1:13:09] of God. When you do, you become
[1:13:13] Christlike.
[1:13:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. You're gentle. You're sweet.
[1:13:18] You've got a gentle, humble spirit.
[1:13:23] So simple, Brother Matt. I know. But so
[1:13:25] wonderful.
[1:13:30] &gt;&gt; Self-control. This is what temperance
[1:13:32] means. I could we could spend sermons on
[1:13:35] each and every single one of these. This
[1:13:37] is what temperance means. It means to be
[1:13:40] controlled, self-control. Listen to what
[1:13:43] brother Adam says here. Temperance
[1:13:44] doesn't mean to stop drinking alcohol.
[1:13:47] No,
[1:13:48] &gt;&gt; temperance doesn't mean alcoholic cure.
[1:13:50] Not in this case. Listen to what brother
[1:13:52] Brandham says here. This is Bible
[1:13:55] temperance, Holy Spirit temperance that
[1:13:59] we're talking about. That means how to
[1:14:01] control your tongue.
[1:14:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:06] &gt;&gt; Not be a tattler.
[1:14:09] &gt;&gt; How to control your temper.
[1:14:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. not fly off every time anybody
[1:14:14] speaks cross to you.
[1:14:17] How to answer in kindness when wrath is
[1:14:21] spoke to you. Somebody says, "You bunch
[1:14:23] of holy rollers." Don't jump out and
[1:14:26] roll up your sleeves,
[1:14:28] &gt;&gt; but talk with godly love, temperance,
[1:14:33] kindness.
[1:14:34] When you're riled upon, rile not back.
[1:14:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:39] &gt;&gt; Let Jesus be your example.
[1:14:42] statue of a perfect man. I love how
[1:14:44] Brother Brandham says that. Don't rile
[1:14:46] back when you're riled upon. Don't rile
[1:14:49] back. Let the Lord be your example. So,
[1:14:53] what is true temperance? It's the
[1:14:56] governor that the Holy Ghost puts upon
[1:14:59] our life.
[1:15:01] &gt;&gt; And it ought to govern our temper.
[1:15:04] It ought to govern our tongue.
[1:15:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:10] It ought to govern what we say, what we
[1:15:13] confess because our words have power
[1:15:17] &gt;&gt; and our words create things.
[1:15:20] It ought to control our confession. It
[1:15:23] ought to control our reactions and our
[1:15:25] attitudes. This is what true
[1:15:28] self-control of the Holy Ghost brings.
[1:15:32] It controls. As the prophet of God said,
[1:15:35] it brings your whole body in subjection
[1:15:39] to the Holy Ghost.
[1:15:41] &gt;&gt; Whatever he says, you say, "Yes, Lord."
[1:15:44] Whenever he says no, you say, "No, Lord.
[1:15:46] I don't want it." Whenever he says go,
[1:15:48] you say, "I'm going to go, Lord."
[1:15:49] Whenever he says stop, you say, "Okay,
[1:15:51] I'll stop, Lord."
[1:15:53] &gt;&gt; It's the Holy Ghost getting control,
[1:15:56] temperance of our life to be able to
[1:15:59] control what we think.
[1:16:02] control what we say, control what we do.
[1:16:06] That's only comes by the nature of the
[1:16:09] Zoey life that comes inside of you. That
[1:16:13] true true nature. You say, "Brother
[1:16:15] Matt, why are you preaching on these
[1:16:17] things?" Because last Wednesday you
[1:16:18] preached all about what they had uh what
[1:16:21] what it what what what it meant to be uh
[1:16:23] key that unlocked the Bible was what the
[1:16:25] first church had. And I believe that
[1:16:26] with all of my hearts, friends, that's
[1:16:28] exactly what it means. It means that
[1:16:31] there will be something that came on the
[1:16:34] day of Pentecost that brought a nature,
[1:16:37] not just gifts, not just tongues, not
[1:16:40] just miracles, not just outward uh
[1:16:43] things like that, but it brought the
[1:16:45] people in full control of the life that
[1:16:49] they had received.
[1:16:52] And when you have the life of the token
[1:16:55] inside of you, you have all of his
[1:16:57] miracles. You have his gifts. You have
[1:17:01] his fruits. You have his manifestation
[1:17:04] because it's the literal life of Jesus
[1:17:07] Christ. And not everybody's the same.
[1:17:11] &gt;&gt; You know, that's that's a truth that is
[1:17:13] as old as the Bible itself. You you I
[1:17:16] can think of so many examples. The way
[1:17:18] that God natured each one of Gad and
[1:17:20] Reuben and Simeon and Levi and and all
[1:17:23] of the sons of Jacob, all of those
[1:17:26] different tribes would represent a
[1:17:28] different nature characteristic because
[1:17:30] God is a God of variety and and even in
[1:17:33] the Bible, those gifts that you read in
[1:17:35] Corinthians
[1:17:37] and and even even uh you know the the
[1:17:39] the the the difference in varieties. The
[1:17:42] Bible speaks of that. I think in Romans
[1:17:43] chapter 12, it talks about the ministers
[1:17:46] and varieties. Let ministers wait on
[1:17:48] their ministering and and teaching on
[1:17:49] those that exhort and those kind of
[1:17:51] things. And so, but but what makes up
[1:17:54] the body of God is that bouquet of of of
[1:17:59] flowers, not just one culture, not just
[1:18:02] one people, not just one style, not just
[1:18:05] one approach. Listen, friends, but God
[1:18:08] is a God of contrast. Amen.
[1:18:11] &gt;&gt; He's a God of of variety. I know you
[1:18:15] have your preference and so do I. But
[1:18:18] many times we confuse our preference
[1:18:20] with God's preference.
[1:18:22] &gt;&gt; And many times what we call right and
[1:18:23] wrong ain't got nothing to do with right
[1:18:25] or wrong. It's just you what you prefer
[1:18:26] and what you don't prefer.
[1:18:30] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[1:18:32] &gt;&gt; And and people if they're not careful,
[1:18:33] they just cut everyone out that's not
[1:18:35] like you, thinks like you, talks like
[1:18:38] you, looks like you.
[1:18:41] We've seen it. We've seen it. And in the
[1:18:43] world that we live in, it's it draws
[1:18:45] separation. It draws boundaries between
[1:18:47] people. Yeah.
[1:18:48] &gt;&gt; And and many people think that the, you
[1:18:50] know, I can I'm just going to get into
[1:18:52] the weeds here just for a moment, but
[1:18:54] you know, many people think that the
[1:18:56] biggest enemy, you know, to the message
[1:18:58] sometimes is is a man who's educated or
[1:19:00] or refined in their speech or
[1:19:02] articulate, you know, and maybe they,
[1:19:04] you know, maybe they hadn't is, you
[1:19:06] know, aren't just a rough gruff, you
[1:19:08] know, uh, evangelistic kind of a
[1:19:11] preacher. And many people think that,
[1:19:12] you know, that that that, you know,
[1:19:14] that's the kind of people who lead
[1:19:15] people away from the the the truth.
[1:19:17] Listen friends, let me just say this.
[1:19:18] Today, there has been just as many
[1:19:20] screaming uh uh uh uh uh uh dynamic,
[1:19:24] charismatic uh uh uh men who stood
[1:19:27] behind the pull pit and preached what we
[1:19:29] call the message of the hour. That has
[1:19:31] led just as many men astray that were
[1:19:34] more refined in their speech. It ain't
[1:19:36] got nothing to do with personalities. It
[1:19:39] personality was not the problem. The
[1:19:41] problem is they never had the token Zoey
[1:19:44] seed life of God.
[1:19:46] They were never born again. That was the
[1:19:48] whole problem.
[1:19:50] &gt;&gt; It's not about it's the problem has not
[1:19:53] been a type of personality or or their
[1:19:55] delivery. The problem is men who have
[1:19:58] invaded the pullpit without the Holy
[1:20:00] Ghost.
[1:20:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:03] &gt;&gt; Because none of us are the same. Can we
[1:20:05] just all admit that here tonight? We're
[1:20:07] not all the same.
[1:20:10] &gt;&gt; We don't all like the same thing.
[1:20:13] &gt;&gt; You know, people from the south are
[1:20:14] different.
[1:20:17] And people, I'll just say it first that
[1:20:20] we're weird. And so are northerners.
[1:20:24] They're weird. And I called me weird
[1:20:26] first. So don't get mad. They're
[1:20:28] different. Westerners are different.
[1:20:30] It's just how people are. Canadians are
[1:20:33] different. I I went to, you know,
[1:20:35] Africa. Africans are different. Chinese
[1:20:37] are different. You know, it's just
[1:20:39] different. And it's not about right or
[1:20:41] wrong. Right?
[1:20:44] &gt;&gt; It's not about right or wrong. Many
[1:20:46] times we call these things that are
[1:20:47] right or wrong prefer and all they are
[1:20:49] is truly preferences that we have.
[1:20:52] &gt;&gt; But none of us are the same. The east
[1:20:54] are different than the west.
[1:20:56] &gt;&gt; It gets even bigger when you look at
[1:20:58] other countries, different foods,
[1:21:00] different flavors, different spices.
[1:21:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:03] &gt;&gt; You know, certain things that they eat
[1:21:06] even you just think, how could they ever
[1:21:08] eat that? Well, that's because you're
[1:21:09] not them and they're not you.
[1:21:10] &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen.
[1:21:12] &gt;&gt; And they look at you and your, you know,
[1:21:16] you know, pigs feet that some people eat
[1:21:18] and some people eat cowbrain, mano,
[1:21:21] lingua, cow tongue.
[1:21:22] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:21:23] &gt;&gt; That's part of their culture.
[1:21:26] &gt;&gt; I wouldn't eat it.
[1:21:30] &gt;&gt; But it's just a difference. It's not
[1:21:32] about right or wrong. I don't know why
[1:21:34] I'm here, but I'm here. It's just
[1:21:37] difference. But does that mean God is
[1:21:39] only going to rapture a certain people
[1:21:40] out of a certain area that speak a
[1:21:42] certain way, have a certain style
[1:21:46] or out of one country? No. The body of
[1:21:48] God is many members.
[1:21:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:51] &gt;&gt; From many different tongues and peoples
[1:21:53] and tribes
[1:21:55] &gt;&gt; uh many different The problem has not
[1:21:57] has not been that. The problem is is
[1:21:59] that our nature, it's not about your
[1:22:02] personalities or your preference. is
[1:22:04] does your nature match the nature of the
[1:22:07] lamb? That's all that God cares about.
[1:22:10] That's all we should care about.
[1:22:13] &gt;&gt; Does the nature match the nature of him?
[1:22:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:19] &gt;&gt; Does it mean that all the bride of
[1:22:20] Christ around the world will talk the
[1:22:22] same, preach the same, look the same,
[1:22:24] act the same?
[1:22:27] American culture, southern culture,
[1:22:29] Western culture.
[1:22:32] I tell you what God was going to do. He
[1:22:34] wasn't going to dress us in a southern
[1:22:36] culture or a northern culture or an
[1:22:39] American way or a western way. He was
[1:22:42] going to come to dress the bride with
[1:22:44] the nature of the lamb. He was going to
[1:22:48] dress the bride and it wasn't going to
[1:22:50] be a culture of man. It would be a bride
[1:22:52] united by one thing, the word and the
[1:22:56] word only. It would be a variety of
[1:22:58] people of all different kinds of
[1:23:00] languages, different countries, but all
[1:23:02] led under the same Holy Ghost. Then you
[1:23:05] say, "Brother Matt, what will be the
[1:23:06] same between all of us?" I'll tell you
[1:23:08] what will be the same. It will be the
[1:23:10] same message of the book of Acts
[1:23:13] original message. It will be one.
[1:23:15] Listen, I believe my Bible says this. It
[1:23:17] says there is one Lord. There is one
[1:23:20] faith. There is one baptism. How many
[1:23:22] believers do we have of that here today?
[1:23:24] There's not many approaches to God.
[1:23:26] There's only one and there's one thing
[1:23:28] that unites us.
[1:23:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:30] &gt;&gt; And it's that original message, that
[1:23:33] standard, that pattern. And the Holy
[1:23:35] Ghost will produce the same person, the
[1:23:38] same sanctified life. Not the same
[1:23:40] personality, but the same sanctified
[1:23:43] life, the same gifts, the same miracle,
[1:23:46] the same miracles, the same character of
[1:23:49] Christ.
[1:23:52] &gt;&gt; You know why? Because it will all be the
[1:23:54] same anointing.
[1:23:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:56] Not an ox, not a man, not a lion, but an
[1:24:00] eagle.
[1:24:02] &gt;&gt; And when you get around eagles, they're
[1:24:04] the same.
[1:24:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:07] &gt;&gt; I've traveled got the privilege of
[1:24:09] traveling to other countries. And man, I
[1:24:12] I can just report to you one simple
[1:24:14] thing. Believers in other countries have
[1:24:15] that same eagle nature.
[1:24:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:19] &gt;&gt; And you know when you're really around
[1:24:21] one, you can fellowship on the same
[1:24:24] exact thing. You say, "How, brother
[1:24:26] Matt?" Because they're all pregnantated
[1:24:27] with the same word and they're all
[1:24:29] producing the same life.
[1:24:32] They're producing the same thing. Listen
[1:24:34] to what Brother Brandham says here.
[1:24:35] We're just going to take just let me
[1:24:37] find out where we are. Okay? We are I
[1:24:40] won't tell you, but we are close. We are
[1:24:42] in the end time. Don't worry.
[1:24:45] This is what brother says. Remember
[1:24:47] this. Christ in Somebody say true
[1:24:50] church.
[1:24:51] &gt;&gt; True church.
[1:24:52] &gt;&gt; Christ in the true church.
[1:24:55] is a continuation of the book of Acts.
[1:24:59] &gt;&gt; Hold on. You mean the book of Acts
[1:25:00] wasn't a previous dispensation
[1:25:03] that was closed and then we moved to a
[1:25:05] No, friends. In order to be a
[1:25:06] continuation, it couldn't be a closure
[1:25:08] in a different dispensation.
[1:25:10] No, we're not planting this church back
[1:25:12] down to seven more ages. But the same
[1:25:14] life that went in the ground would be
[1:25:17] found in the seed form again.
[1:25:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:20] Christ in the true church is a
[1:25:22] continuation of the book of acts. But
[1:25:24] the book of revelation shows how that
[1:25:26] the antichrist spirit would come into
[1:25:27] the church defile it making it
[1:25:30] lukewarm
[1:25:33] formal
[1:25:35] and powerless. It exposes Satan
[1:25:37] revealing his works attempted
[1:25:39] destruction of God's people and the
[1:25:40] discredited of God's word right down to
[1:25:41] the time he's cast a lake of fire. He
[1:25:43] fights that. He cannot stand that. He
[1:25:46] knows that if the people get the true
[1:25:48] revelation of the true church and what
[1:25:50] she is and I love this and what she
[1:25:52] stands for
[1:25:54] &gt;&gt; and that she can do the greater work,
[1:25:56] she will be an invincible
[1:26:00] army
[1:26:02] &gt;&gt; if they get a true revelation of the two
[1:26:06] spirits
[1:26:07] within the framework of the Christian
[1:26:10] church
[1:26:11] &gt;&gt; and by God's spirit discern and
[1:26:15] withstand the antichrist spirit, Satan
[1:26:19] will be powerless before her.
[1:26:23] &gt;&gt; You believe that?
[1:26:24] &gt;&gt; If they recognize that within the same
[1:26:28] framework is people confessing the same
[1:26:30] message, confessing the same prophet,
[1:26:33] believing that they say believe say that
[1:26:35] they believe the same thing, but the
[1:26:38] spirit would not be the same spirit.
[1:26:41] Hello.
[1:26:42] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:26:43] You can have all the message and miss
[1:26:44] the spirit of the message.
[1:26:46] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:26:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:48] &gt;&gt; I said you can have all of the message
[1:26:50] and miss the spirit of the message
[1:26:51] itself.
[1:26:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:53] &gt;&gt; You can have all the truth and miss the
[1:26:55] miss the spirit behind the truth because
[1:26:56] the the Bible says it's the spirit of
[1:26:59] truth.
[1:27:00] &gt;&gt; Truth has a spirit. It's a person. So
[1:27:02] you can have the truth but not have the
[1:27:04] spirit of truth.
[1:27:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. The tree of knowledge produced
[1:27:08] clever men, men of renown, but their
[1:27:11] ways are the ways of death. God's people
[1:27:13] are simple.
[1:27:15] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:27:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:19] &gt;&gt; But spiritually minded, leaning toward
[1:27:22] God and nature, calmly tilling the soil,
[1:27:28] caring for truth rather than wealth.
[1:27:32] I love that, friends.
[1:27:35] caring for truth
[1:27:38] rather than wealth.
[1:27:40] &gt;&gt; Can I just say you you would be
[1:27:44] hardpressed to convince
[1:27:47] to convince me that you've truly been
[1:27:49] born of the spirit of God if you don't
[1:27:51] have a hunger and a care for the word of
[1:27:56] God.
[1:27:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:58] It's one of the most evident fruits a
[1:28:01] person has truly been born of the spirit
[1:28:03] of God is that they love and care for
[1:28:07] the word of God.
[1:28:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:09] &gt;&gt; They want to know what it says. They
[1:28:11] want to know what it says to them. They
[1:28:13] want to live what it says. They want to
[1:28:15] know what it says.
[1:28:17] You can't tell me you've been born truly
[1:28:19] born of the spirit of God and there's no
[1:28:21] thought or time ever to know and read
[1:28:24] your Bible
[1:28:27] &gt;&gt; to never break this Bible open and read
[1:28:30] it for yourself. Friend, I'm just going
[1:28:32] to be honest with you. I I I I don't see
[1:28:35] how
[1:28:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:37] &gt;&gt; that there's got if there's not a simple
[1:28:39] not just a not just a not just a wanting
[1:28:42] to know but a care as brother Brandham
[1:28:44] says there they care for the truth.
[1:28:47] &gt;&gt; Amen
[1:28:48] &gt;&gt; rather than wealth. The seed of the
[1:28:51] serpent has brought tremendous commerce,
[1:28:53] wonderful inventions. But with it all
[1:28:55] comes death. Their gunpowder and atomic
[1:28:57] bombs kill in war. and in peace a time.
[1:29:00] Their mechanical inventions such as the
[1:29:02] car kill even more in a time of peace
[1:29:04] than do the inventions of war that
[1:29:06] destroy in the time of trouble. Death
[1:29:08] and destruction are the fruit of her of
[1:29:13] her labors. But they are religious. They
[1:29:16] believe in God. They are like their
[1:29:18] father, the devil, and their ancestor
[1:29:20] Cain. Both of them believed in God. They
[1:29:22] go to church. They mingle with the
[1:29:24] righteous as do tears with the wheat. In
[1:29:26] so doing, they corrupt and produce a
[1:29:28] nicicoatan religion. They spread their
[1:29:30] poison and every effort to try to
[1:29:33] destroy the seed of God, even as Cain
[1:29:36] killed Abel. Jude says, "Their spots in
[1:29:38] your feast of charity when they feast
[1:29:40] with you, feeding themselves without
[1:29:42] fear, clouds they are without water,
[1:29:44] carried about of winds, trees whose
[1:29:46] fruit witherth without fruit, twice
[1:29:48] dead." You know how you become twice
[1:29:50] dead? Because you're already
[1:29:52] spiritually, you're already dead when
[1:29:54] you're born.
[1:29:55] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen.
[1:29:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:57] &gt;&gt; But now you're spiritually dead,
[1:30:00] plucked up by the roots.
[1:30:04] So this is this is this is how close it
[1:30:07] would be. As the Bible says, it would be
[1:30:09] so close that it would deceive the very
[1:30:11] elected if it were possible. What would
[1:30:14] be the difference, brother Matt? The
[1:30:16] token will be the difference. Amen.
[1:30:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:20] &gt;&gt; Not a manifestation, not a sensation,
[1:30:24] not even one of the fruits of the
[1:30:26] spirit.
[1:30:28] &gt;&gt; But the difference will be the token
[1:30:30] &gt;&gt; which is the literal life of Christ in
[1:30:34] the nature of the soul projecting
[1:30:37] itself.
[1:30:42] &gt;&gt; Listen what brother, this is Matthew
[1:30:43] chapter 20 was our scripture. I'm just
[1:30:45] going to read it and then we'll close.
[1:30:47] The kingdom of heaven is likened unto a
[1:30:48] man that's a householder which went out
[1:30:50] early in the morning to hire laborers.
[1:30:51] We read this. Notice early in the
[1:30:53] morning. Let's read verse three. And
[1:30:56] when he went out about the third hour, I
[1:30:58] love this. He went out about the third
[1:31:01] hour and saw where where else do you
[1:31:03] find that third hour in your Bible? I
[1:31:05] think it was Acts two that we read that
[1:31:08] Peter said, seeing it's about the third
[1:31:10] hour of the day. These are not drunk. So
[1:31:13] what was it? This was the first hours.
[1:31:16] This was the early morning. As the
[1:31:18] prophet of God said, these workers that
[1:31:21] he's that he's telling us about in
[1:31:23] Matthew chap 20 are the laborers, the
[1:31:26] original laborers in the vineyard on the
[1:31:30] day of Pentecost in the book of Acts.
[1:31:32] These were those original workers that
[1:31:35] received the the the the the wages for
[1:31:39] their labors.
[1:31:40] &gt;&gt; And he says he went about the other
[1:31:42] third hour and saw others standing idle.
[1:31:43] said to them, "Go you also in the
[1:31:44] vineyard. Whatsoever is right, I'll give
[1:31:46] you." They went in their way. Again he
[1:31:48] went out about the 6th and the 9inth
[1:31:51] hour and did likewise. And about the
[1:31:54] 11th hour he went out. Hold on a minute.
[1:31:57] It goes from 6 to 9 to 11. And he found
[1:32:01] others standing idle and said, "What is
[1:32:03] the 11th hour?" The 11th hour is the
[1:32:06] last hour
[1:32:08] &gt;&gt; of the day.
[1:32:10] Because something special is going to
[1:32:12] come not at the first, second, third,
[1:32:13] fourth, fifth hour, sixth hour, ninth
[1:32:16] hour, but something very special is
[1:32:18] going to happen on the 12th hour.
[1:32:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:21] &gt;&gt; You see, the Bible says that the kingdom
[1:32:23] of heaven is likened unto two virgins.
[1:32:27] &gt;&gt; And the Bible says, "But at the 12th
[1:32:29] hour, the midnight hour,
[1:32:31] &gt;&gt; a cry went forth, go you out to meet
[1:32:34] him." So what was going to happen on the
[1:32:36] 12th hour would be the coming of the
[1:32:38] Lord. But there would be an 11th hour
[1:32:41] gentile worker that would receive the
[1:32:43] same pay as the first worker.
[1:32:47] &gt;&gt; And and and this is what he says here.
[1:32:49] He says about the 11th hour and found
[1:32:50] others standing idle. And and verse 8,
[1:32:53] so when even was come, that means the
[1:32:55] evening time, the Lord of the vineyard
[1:32:58] said unto his steward, call the labors
[1:32:59] and give them their hire, beginning from
[1:33:00] the first to the last. Listen to this.
[1:33:03] And and because this is this is so
[1:33:05] beautiful here. And brother Random says
[1:33:06] this and and I'm just going to skip some
[1:33:08] of this here. Notice he says, "The
[1:33:10] seventh angel message, seventh angel's
[1:33:12] message is to open the mystery of the
[1:33:14] seals, calling the 11th hour gentile
[1:33:17] workers to receive the same pay that the
[1:33:21] first hour workers got."
[1:33:23] &gt;&gt; Jesus taught it. He said there was
[1:33:25] people went into the harvest. They were
[1:33:27] hired and when they did of early
[1:33:29] morning, they received a penny for the
[1:33:31] day. And then at noon time, someone else
[1:33:34] came and went to work. And then at the
[1:33:35] 11th hour, that's the last hour of the
[1:33:38] day, that someone came in and received
[1:33:40] the same kind of pay they did at the
[1:33:43] first hour, the last hour. And it's so
[1:33:46] perfectly how the first hour messengers
[1:33:48] with the word, with the gospel, with the
[1:33:51] truth, they came in at the day of
[1:33:53] Pentecost. Then there was a a dark age
[1:33:56] that blacked them out at the middle of
[1:33:58] the day. Luther Wesley came in. And then
[1:34:01] there had there is to be an evening time
[1:34:04] message and to receive the same thing.
[1:34:07] Somebody say same thing.
[1:34:09] &gt;&gt; To receive the same thing they did at
[1:34:12] the beginning. The evening time message
[1:34:14] is to restore back again. To bring the
[1:34:18] same thing back again.
[1:34:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:21] &gt;&gt; You say, "Brother Matt, what are you
[1:34:23] preaching?" I'm just preaching what it
[1:34:24] says in Matthew chapter 20. that the end
[1:34:27] time worker didn't get what the the what
[1:34:29] the you know some other pay, you know,
[1:34:31] something else or something more or some
[1:34:34] new gospel or some new teaching or some
[1:34:37] new idea. They try to make the message
[1:34:39] some kind of new thing or new
[1:34:41] dispensation and the book of acts was a
[1:34:43] previous dispensation. My Bible says the
[1:34:46] 11th hour gentile worker gets the same
[1:34:49] pay as the first age, first off Ephesus,
[1:34:53] first messenger, first gospel. It was
[1:34:56] the alpha and the omega.
[1:34:59] &gt;&gt; And they would receive the very same
[1:35:01] pay.
[1:35:05] &gt;&gt; You say, "Brother Matt, well, why is
[1:35:08] that important?" Here's why. Because he
[1:35:10] said, "The bride will come into preview
[1:35:12] again." And here come the bride. Notice
[1:35:14] Brother Bam sees this worldly church,
[1:35:17] USA. Brother Bham says, "What a horrible
[1:35:21] sight." And he says, "I've watched."
[1:35:23] He's that first church comes through
[1:35:25] preview and he says marching beautiful
[1:35:27] white flowing and he said just just a
[1:35:30] pure unadulterated group and brother
[1:35:33] Brandham says then he said then the the
[1:35:34] church of America will come into preview
[1:35:36] and brother Brandham says if I ever seen
[1:35:37] such a horrible mess he said oh I just I
[1:35:40] bowed my head and said Lord after all
[1:35:42] the times all the gospels went sea to
[1:35:44] sea and we've stood and preached for you
[1:35:45] and this is the best we could produce.
[1:35:48] He was seeing what was he seeing? And
[1:35:49] I'll tell you what he was seeing in some
[1:35:50] of the modern churches you see around uh
[1:35:53] uh us even here today on YouTube and and
[1:35:55] got millions of followers and they
[1:35:57] became a you know a social culture where
[1:35:59] they just accept everybody tolerate
[1:36:01] everything.
[1:36:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:03] &gt;&gt; And some of the things that we think are
[1:36:05] pure you know even some of the most
[1:36:07] purest things that it's hard to find
[1:36:09] good pure things to to even uh entertain
[1:36:12] yourself with anymore friends because
[1:36:13] they've all drunken of the wine of her
[1:36:16] wrath of her fornication. You almost
[1:36:18] can't find nobody to really take a stand
[1:36:20] for Jesus. I'm just going to go ahead
[1:36:22] and say it, you know, and I I don't want
[1:36:24] to I don't want to draw a circle or draw
[1:36:26] a line here, even bring it up because
[1:36:27] I'm not I'm not like that. But I was
[1:36:29] just reading today of Chip and Joanna
[1:36:32] Gains. Here was a what was supposed to
[1:36:34] be be a you know a wholesome you know
[1:36:36] thing. People visited went to Waco and
[1:36:38] seen you know that Magnolia all of that
[1:36:41] and I you know not I'm not here to to
[1:36:43] only God will be their judge. But but I
[1:36:46] was reading what even here here was
[1:36:48] after all the criticism that people make
[1:36:50] and the uproar of them allowing a
[1:36:52] same-sex couple. I don't even watch that
[1:36:54] show. I'm just telling you what uh just
[1:36:56] what I just read. You know, a lot of
[1:36:57] same-sex couple, you know, and and and
[1:36:59] and and there was this outrage and this
[1:37:02] great outrage and this cry against it.
[1:37:04] How could you do this? And and they were
[1:37:06] just silent until I think it was
[1:37:08] yesterday. And and here was here's
[1:37:10] opportunity to respond. You know what he
[1:37:12] said? He said it's so sad that people
[1:37:14] can't accept I'm trying to remember the
[1:37:16] way that the words that he used, but he
[1:37:18] said they can't accept a modern cultured
[1:37:21] Christian. Something like that.
[1:37:24] &gt;&gt; A modern cultured Christian.
[1:37:28] &gt;&gt; In other words, I the reason I'm doing
[1:37:30] this because I've got to be a modern
[1:37:31] cultured Christian. One who just, you
[1:37:33] know, we we've got to change with the
[1:37:36] times. We've got to, you know, become
[1:37:38] more tolerant. And he says, "It's so sad
[1:37:40] that the first hate that they receive is
[1:37:42] is your people who are criticized in a
[1:37:44] modern culture. Do you go look it up?"
[1:37:45] Maybe you maybe it wasn't the exact way
[1:37:47] he said it, but I promise you if you got
[1:37:49] the Holy Spirit inside of you, it'll
[1:37:51] nauseate you as bad as it nauseated me
[1:37:53] to read it. And I'm not here to
[1:37:55] criticize, you know, that man or that
[1:37:57] show or anything like that. I'm just
[1:37:59] here to to tell you tonight. I'm just
[1:38:00] here to declare one thing. The gospel of
[1:38:03] Jesus Christ has never been about making
[1:38:05] people feel good or to make everybody
[1:38:08] feel good about themselves or to be
[1:38:10] socially accepted or to be accepted by
[1:38:12] the masses. It was meant to separate the
[1:38:16] good from the evil. It was a sword that
[1:38:18] was to to to come to divide the truth
[1:38:21] from the error. And we've got to stand
[1:38:23] on the word of God and preach it the way
[1:38:25] that it was preached originally. It was
[1:38:28] the same faith, the same gospel, one
[1:38:30] Lord, one faith, one baptism.
[1:38:34] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says that notice he
[1:38:36] said they seem that modern church
[1:38:38] twisting and to the beat of rock and
[1:38:40] roll music almost nude, nothing covered
[1:38:42] in a little gray piece of newspaper.
[1:38:44] Brother Brandham says,
[1:38:46] &gt;&gt; "Amen."
[1:38:47] &gt;&gt; And he says, and I bowed my head, said,
[1:38:48] "Lord, is this the best we can do after
[1:38:50] all that we've done?" He said, the voice
[1:38:51] spoke and said, "The bride will come
[1:38:53] into preview again." Hallelujah.
[1:38:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:58] &gt;&gt; And here the bride came behind her. The
[1:39:00] very same looking bride.
[1:39:04] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[1:39:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:06] &gt;&gt; The very same looking bride.
[1:39:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:12] &gt;&gt; Oh, so the bride of the end time looks
[1:39:16] like the bride of the first time.
[1:39:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:39:22] &gt;&gt; The bride of the end time matches what
[1:39:25] the
[1:39:26] &gt;&gt; first end time.
[1:39:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:29] &gt;&gt; You say, "I wonder what the end time I
[1:39:31] wonder what, brother Matt, I've always
[1:39:33] wondered what would the first church
[1:39:34] look like." Well, if we'd be honest, it
[1:39:36] looks a lot like this church.
[1:39:39] &gt;&gt; You want to know what the first church
[1:39:41] looked like? Look at a real believer.
[1:39:42] It'll tell you what the first church age
[1:39:44] looked like
[1:39:45] &gt;&gt; because this was to be a return. Brother
[1:39:47] Brandham says, "Looking bride that
[1:39:49] passed at the beginning, then my heart
[1:39:51] jumped for joy to know there will be a
[1:39:53] bride." Are you glad you're part of it?
[1:39:55] &gt;&gt; And she will be made of the same thing,
[1:39:58] clothed in the same thing the one was at
[1:40:02] the beginning.
[1:40:11] &gt;&gt; The same as she was at the beginning.
[1:40:15] Let's all stand to our feet tonight.
[1:40:19] The same life,
[1:40:23] the same love, peace, joy,
[1:40:29] wisdom,
[1:40:32] demonstration
[1:40:34] of the Holy Ghost.
[1:40:37] You see friends, this what we believe is
[1:40:39] not some new religion or new
[1:40:42] denomination, new idea. The message was
[1:40:45] never about when we make it some kind of
[1:40:49] new dispensation
[1:40:52] and say that Acts two was some previous
[1:40:54] dispensation and that was a different
[1:40:56] baptism and there's the Holy Ghost and
[1:40:58] the Holy Spirit are two different
[1:40:59] things. You make the message I'm just
[1:41:02] going to say it as plain as I can. When
[1:41:04] we make the message some kind of new
[1:41:06] thing, you remove it from what the Bible
[1:41:09] said it was to be.
[1:41:13] You remove it from what the what what
[1:41:15] gave the truth would be the word of God
[1:41:18] would define what the truth was. Not
[1:41:20] men, not not preachers, though. Thank
[1:41:22] God for preachers, but it wouldn't be
[1:41:24] them. It would be God who defined what
[1:41:26] the original pattern was. And the
[1:41:29] message of the hour was never about
[1:41:30] coming to some new thing. It was always
[1:41:33] about a restoration of the original.
[1:41:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:38] &gt;&gt; Can I get a hearty amen from Bethl
[1:41:39] Tabernacle?
[1:41:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. It was never a new dress code. We
[1:41:43] don't have a new dress code. We have the
[1:41:44] original.
[1:41:46] &gt;&gt; It was ne never about a new doctrine. It
[1:41:48] was not about that that one thing.
[1:41:51] Listen friends, when when brother
[1:41:53] Brandon goes beyond the curtain of time
[1:41:54] there and and he's standing there even
[1:41:56] even in another place, he's telling
[1:41:57] about the vision and and how that he
[1:42:01] says you have to the angel the voice
[1:42:03] said you'll have to be judged with your
[1:42:05] people according to the things that you
[1:42:08] preached. And brother Baron says a fear
[1:42:11] gripped his heart. This is what I've
[1:42:12] preached.
[1:42:13] &gt;&gt; And then the prophet of God says, 'I I
[1:42:15] asked and said, will Paul have to stand
[1:42:17] with his people, Luther? He says, yeah.
[1:42:19] Will Paul? Yep. Brother Brandham says,
[1:42:23] will Paul be accepted?
[1:42:26] And the voice says, yes, Paul will be
[1:42:29] accepted. And brother Random says, I
[1:42:32] breathed a great sigh of relief and
[1:42:34] said, praise God. then we'll be accepted
[1:42:37] too because I preached what Paul
[1:42:40] preached.
[1:42:43] &gt;&gt; And he says, "And the voices of
[1:42:45] thousands of people cried out, we are
[1:42:48] resting upon that."
[1:42:52] &gt;&gt; What was the church resting upon? Their
[1:42:56] works,
[1:42:57] their ability, their behavior,
[1:43:02] how good of a grade they would make. No,
[1:43:04] that wasn't the rest of the bride. The
[1:43:06] rest of the bride is that they believed
[1:43:07] the message for their hour
[1:43:09] &gt;&gt; and that messenger was faithful to the
[1:43:12] word, the original word pattern
[1:43:15] &gt;&gt; and I'm resting upon it.
[1:43:17] &gt;&gt; I'm resting upon that. It's so simple
[1:43:20] and I'm so glad he came to the simple
[1:43:23] and it's so wonderful and I'm glad. I
[1:43:25] just want to say Lord, thank you that
[1:43:27] I'm a part of it. How many want to do
[1:43:30] that here tonight? Thank you, Lord.
[1:43:33] As the song says, you you you didn't
[1:43:35] have to open my eyes. You could have
[1:43:37] easily passed me by.
[1:43:40] Oh Lord,
[1:43:42] you didn't have to do it, but you did.
[1:43:45] I just want to say thank you, Lord God.
[1:43:49] What What did I do, Lord, to deserve
[1:43:51] nothing I could do?
[1:43:55] nothing I could bring, Lord, but grace,
[1:44:00] amazing grace in my life.
[1:44:04] I just want to say maybe someone could
[1:44:07] say it by an uplifted hand. Lord, if
[1:44:10] I've not borne those type of fruits,
[1:44:13] then Lord, prune me. Prune every branch
[1:44:17] that's not bringing forth that kind of
[1:44:19] fruit in my life. I got both of my hands
[1:44:21] raised. Prune it, Lord God, if it would
[1:44:23] be anything, Lord, that would not bring
[1:44:26] forth true life.
[1:44:29] Not anything I produce, Lord. Not
[1:44:32] produced from the impatience or produced
[1:44:34] from not wanting to wait, Lord. But if
[1:44:36] there would be anything that would be
[1:44:38] producing a spirit that would be unlike
[1:44:41] the spirit of my original lamb, that
[1:44:44] lamb can only that dove can only rest on
[1:44:48] a nature that matches his nature.
[1:44:53] So God, prune it out of my life. Take it
[1:44:56] from me, God. If you've got to rip it
[1:44:59] out of my hands. Oh, can you do that,
[1:45:00] friend? Can you keep your hand up? If
[1:45:02] you got to rip it out of my hands, Lord,
[1:45:05] rip it out, Jesus.
[1:45:08] I might love it, might cherish it, Lord,
[1:45:10] but if it's if it's not bringing forth
[1:45:13] fruit,
[1:45:17] in this will you be glorified.
[1:45:21] that we bear fruits.
[1:45:24] What kind of fruits? Peter says the
[1:45:26] fruits of righteousness,
[1:45:28] not numbers, not success by wealth,
[1:45:32] success by prosperity, success by
[1:45:34] external things.
[1:45:36] But Peter tells us it's the fruit of
[1:45:38] righteousness.
[1:45:42] That righteousness is not our own, Lord.
[1:45:44] That's your your righteousness, Lord.
[1:45:47] Clothed
[1:45:49] in your garments.
[1:45:53] [Music]
[1:45:55] You've given it to us, Lord. And
[1:45:58] your word tells us to let these things
[1:46:01] be in us and abound.
[1:46:04] To become partakers of the divine
[1:46:07] nature. Those are the things that we
[1:46:09] want Lord in our life to be a partaker
[1:46:12] of the divine nature.
[1:46:16] That life Lord that was came back on the
[1:46:19] day of Pentecost. That life Lord God is
[1:46:22] the same life that's available here
[1:46:25] tonight. It's available to every person.
[1:46:28] It's available to every young person,
[1:46:30] every old person, every family. For you
[1:46:33] said, "The promise is unto you, to your
[1:46:35] children, to them that are a far off, as
[1:46:39] many as the Lord our God shall call."
[1:46:41] That promise, Lord, that you made, you
[1:46:44] still stand behind it. You still back it
[1:46:47] up, Lord. It's the promise, Lord, of
[1:46:50] prevailing power. When we can't
[1:46:52] overcome, there's a overcomer living on
[1:46:55] in the inside of us. When we feel like
[1:46:58] giving up, oh, but there's a spirit that
[1:47:00] won't let us. Lord, when we make
[1:47:03] mistakes, there's there's a conviction
[1:47:05] that comes, Lord, by your Holy Spirit
[1:47:08] says, you ought not to do that. You
[1:47:09] ought not to have said that, Lord, when
[1:47:12] we need understanding, you're the
[1:47:14] teacher. You're the guide. You're the
[1:47:16] spirit of wisdom. You're the spirit of
[1:47:18] knowledge. When we're in trouble, Lord,
[1:47:21] your spirit brings peace.
[1:47:24] When we're down,
[1:47:27] we can put on the garments of praise.
[1:47:30] you be the joy of our salvation.
[1:47:33] I pray Lord that if we'd find oursel in
[1:47:36] any condition, anything Lord God that
[1:47:38] would be less than that original
[1:47:40] pattern,
[1:47:42] then convict our hearts. Lord, bring us
[1:47:45] back to to the true benchmark, the true
[1:47:48] keystone, the true plum line as your
[1:47:51] prophet said. Not a new gospel, Lord.
[1:47:54] Not to not a not another Jesus,
[1:47:58] Lord, but that same original. Yeah. Men
[1:48:01] have gotten impatient. Men have men,
[1:48:04] Lord, have have not been able to just
[1:48:06] believe the simplicity of what you said.
[1:48:08] And they've they've created, Lord, all
[1:48:11] kinds of ideas, ideas of men. And it's
[1:48:14] produced Ishmails. It's produced
[1:48:16] destruction. It's produced death.
[1:48:20] All because we we can't accept the
[1:48:22] simplicity of the gospel. But I just
[1:48:25] raise my hand and say, "Lord, I accept
[1:48:26] it with all of my heart. I don't need
[1:48:28] something new. Oh, do you can you say
[1:48:30] that, friend? I don't need something
[1:48:32] new. I don't need some kind of new idea.
[1:48:34] I don't need some kind of new fresh
[1:48:36] thing. You know, the the latest and the
[1:48:38] greatest, the cutting edge. Oh, I
[1:48:40] believe you're revealing things, Lord.
[1:48:41] Revelation upon revelation. It's the
[1:48:43] greatest power in our life. But that
[1:48:45] revelation will match what the word
[1:48:47] said. It won't be some kind of new idea.
[1:48:50] It'll always bring us back to the
[1:48:52] original.
[1:48:55] &gt;&gt; I pray God that you would bring us back
[1:48:56] to that Jesus. That truth that's so
[1:48:58] simple,
[1:49:00] so wonderful, Lord. We ask it in Jesus
[1:49:02] Christ's name. Oh, let's sing it. Sing
[1:49:04] Brother Ken.
[1:49:07] [Music]
[1:49:10] &gt;&gt; Let's sing this as we gather. Come and
[1:49:12] gather now.
[1:49:13] &gt;&gt; And I will search for
[1:49:16] &gt;&gt; Jesus. Jesus, take my life and lead me
[1:49:22] on.
[1:49:25] Oh
[1:49:27] Lord, you have my heart.
[1:49:29] &gt;&gt; Can you say that, Lord?
[1:49:31] &gt;&gt; And I will search for you, oh Jesus. Let
[1:49:37] me be to you a sacrifice.
[1:49:43] [Music]
[1:49:45] And I will praise you.
[1:49:50] &gt;&gt; I will praise you, Lord.
[1:49:54] &gt;&gt; And I will sing of love. Come down.
[1:50:00] &gt;&gt; I will sing of love.
[1:50:03] &gt;&gt; And as you show your face,
[1:50:11] we'll see. We'll see your glory. for
[1:50:15] glory.
[1:50:16] &gt;&gt; Let's sing that again now. And I will
[1:50:19] praise you, Lord.
[1:50:21] And I will praise you. I will praise
[1:50:29] you. And I will sing of love come down.
[1:50:35] I will sing of love. Come and as you
[1:50:42] show your face your face
[1:50:48] will see
[1:50:50] your glory.
[1:50:55] Sister Sarah Y says, "I've been in pain
[1:50:57] since Sunday evening with my lower back.
[1:50:59] The pain is excruciating. I can barely
[1:51:01] walk. My goodness." Want to pray for
[1:51:03] Sister Sarah. My memo says, "My neighbor
[1:51:05] Ruth has been very sick for more than a
[1:51:07] week with bronchitis. I don't have any
[1:51:10] other needs that I see written down.
[1:51:12] Maybe you just have something upon your
[1:51:13] heart. You just want to lift that hand
[1:51:15] up to the Lord. Let him see it now.
[1:51:17] Jesus, you see these hands, Lord. God,
[1:51:20] you see every need, the heart that's
[1:51:22] unspoken here tonight. Maybe one that
[1:51:24] was touched, Lord, by one thing, just
[1:51:26] one thing that was said tonight. I pray
[1:51:30] God that you would start right there
[1:51:32] Lord and bring forth a fruit in in that
[1:51:34] life Lord that that that Lord that can
[1:51:37] be satisfied Lord that that can say I I
[1:51:41] I may not I may not be perfect. I may
[1:51:43] not have it all put together. Oh, but I
[1:51:46] can just start with this one truth right
[1:51:48] here. I know in whom I have believed and
[1:51:52] he's faithful and he's faithful. He's
[1:51:56] faithful to his word. who's faithful to
[1:51:58] his promises. I pray God that you would
[1:52:00] come on these needs beha on behalf of
[1:52:02] sister Sarah. Lord, may you touch our
[1:52:04] sister God maybe at home tonight
[1:52:06] streaming. I pray that you would touch

[1:52:10] God in this in her lower back. I pray
[1:52:13] Jesus for Ruth, my mama's neighbor, very
[1:52:16] sick. God, the power of prayer changes
[1:52:18] things. We believe that Lord, I believe
[1:52:21] that you can go to Ruth right now, God,
[1:52:22] and you could heal her of that sickness.
[1:52:25] Let it be Jesus on any of these hands
[1:52:27] that went up. Lord, I pray God that you
[1:52:30] would be the need meter. Grant it to
[1:52:32] them, Lord Jesus. I pray we'll testify
[1:52:34] about it. We'll give you all the thanks
[1:52:36] and all the glory, all the honor for
[1:52:40] you're worthy of it in Jesus name. Amen.
[1:52:45] Let's sing it again now. And I will
[1:52:48] praise you, Lord.

[1:53:10] face.

[1:53:14] your glory.

[1:53:26] and I will search for you. Oh Jesus,

[1:54:24] your glory. One more time. I will praise
[1:54:31] and I will praise you, Lord.
