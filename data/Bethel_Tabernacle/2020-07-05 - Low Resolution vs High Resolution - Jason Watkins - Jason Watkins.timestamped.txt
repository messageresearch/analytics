[2:53] good morning a man gonna use this mic
[2:56] right here brother Joe a man greets you
[3:00] all in the name of the Lord this morning
[3:01] a man and happy to be here in the house
[3:04] of the Lord on the church connection it
[3:11] said there was no no internet connection
[3:14] so I'm hot spotting from my phone
[3:16] you might just check that out man
[3:23] appreciate you brothers being here too
[3:26] for our broadcast team as those of you
[3:29] who are viewing remotely will remember
[3:32] we indicated that our Sunday School
[3:35] classes will no longer be attended by
[3:38] the live audience but we're going to
[3:40] continue to broadcast it because I I
[3:44] definitely want to continue with that in
[3:47] fact is today I'm beginning a series
[3:51] I've let brother Matt know I still have
[3:56] yet to let brother Jason DeMars know
[3:58] though I'm sure but the Jason is
[4:00] listening now that I'm going to take a
[4:03] series on the entire book of Revelation
[4:07] I've wanted to do it for quite some time
[4:10] and so I'm going to actually take the
[4:14] Lord willing the Sunday schools going
[4:17] forward for the next while brother Matt
[4:20] and brother Jason will tag-team the
[4:22] Wednesday nights and of course in the
[4:24] middle of all that we'll have visiting
[4:25] ministers we already know but the digs
[4:28] is scheduled for July on a Wednesday
[4:30] brother Dale is visiting us again
[4:33] I actually am scheduled to be at my
[4:37] niece's wedding on the the weekend I
[4:40] think of Sunday the 18th so there will
[4:42] be those kind of interruptions in it but
[4:45] I've wanted to do a series on the book
[4:48] of Revelation for a while so we're just
[4:51] going to get started in today laying a
[4:53] little bit of groundwork we're not going
[4:55] to go too far into it but we're going to
[4:58] go in far enough just to get the idea of
[5:03] the direction I want to
[5:05] and then from there we to make it an
[5:08] in-depth study don't know how long it'll
[5:10] take me but I have a dual purpose and
[5:13] that is that I I will use this material
[5:17] to transition all of this material into
[5:21] the pot one of the podcast channels that
[5:24] brother Matt and brother Jason and I are
[5:27] doing we're still trying to get all of
[5:29] that up off the ground we've got all of
[5:31] our equipment we're getting our studio
[5:33] finished up and hopefully we will be we
[5:36] have done some filming just as rehearsal
[5:40] for how we want to how we want it to go
[5:43] but we're still working on that so you
[5:46] keep us in prayer for that whether or
[5:48] not that'll be the podcast that involves
[5:51] all three of us or it'll be my own
[5:52] private podcast I don't know but this
[5:55] material will then transition to that so
[5:57] that's kind of my dual purpose in it
[6:00] we're gonna go right to the book of
[6:03] Revelation chapter one and begin at
[6:05] verse one I read these eight verses at a
[6:08] service recently when I was emphasizing
[6:11] another thing at at a different
[6:13] sunday-school I'm gonna reread it again
[6:15] this morning
[6:16] Revelation chapter 1 verse 1 through 8
[6:23] the revelation of Jesus Christ which God
[6:26] gave unto him to show his servants
[6:29] things which must shortly come to pass
[6:32] and he sent and signified it by his
[6:35] angel unto his servant John who bare
[6:38] record of the word of God and of the
[6:41] testimony of Jesus Christ and of all
[6:44] things that he saw blessed is he that
[6:47] readeth and they that hear the words of
[6:49] this prophecy and keep those things
[6:51] which are written therein for the time
[6:54] is at hand John to the seven churches
[6:57] which are in Asia grace be unto you and
[7:01] peace from him which is and which was
[7:03] and which is to come and from the seven
[7:06] spirits which are before his throne and
[7:08] from Jesus Christ who is the faithful
[7:10] witness and the first begotten of the
[7:13] Dead and the Prince of the kings of the
[7:16] earth
[7:18] you perhaps remember in a previous
[7:21] service I believe it was a Sunday school
[7:23] class where I emphasized how that he was
[7:28] King of Kings I believe that was my
[7:30] Sunday school title King of Kings and we
[7:33] went we just took a quick snippet of
[7:37] world events currently happening and we
[7:40] begin to show you you know various
[7:43] things that have happened down through
[7:45] history but yet at the same time God is
[7:48] always in control of it and we were
[7:50] emphasizing that no matter what we see
[7:53] and we're in very unsettling times but
[7:56] but the the point was made and I'll just
[8:00] reinforce it today he is the Prince of
[8:03] all Kings and so he he rules the world
[8:07] he's in perfect control there's nothing
[8:10] outside of his of his notice there's
[8:14] nothing happening outside of his control
[8:17] let's continue reading because we came
[8:20] to verse let's read verse 5 again in
[8:23] Jesus Christ who is the faithful witness
[8:26] and the first begotten of the Dead and
[8:28] the Prince of the kings of the earth
[8:30] unto him that loved us and washed us
[8:33] from our sins in his own blood and hath
[8:36] made us now that was another point we
[8:38] made and hath made us kings and priests
[8:41] unto God and his father to him be glory
[8:44] and Dominion forever and ever amen
[8:47] behold he cometh with clouds and every
[8:49] eye shall see him we know that this is
[8:52] at the end of the Tribulation Period
[8:54] this is not the secret catching away in
[8:57] that instance he comes as a thief and
[9:00] they also which pierced him and all
[9:03] Kindred's of the earth shall wail
[9:05] because of him even so a man I'm Alpha
[9:09] and Omega the beginning and the ending
[9:10] saith the LORD which is and which was
[9:12] and which is to come the Almighty amen
[9:16] father we thank you for your word and we
[9:19] asked now Lord that you give us divine
[9:22] inspiration Lord as we begin to look
[9:25] into this as a Bible study as a Sunday
[9:27] School class we commit it to you in
[9:29] Jesus name
[9:31] amen now we're finding that that as we
[9:39] were talking about when we preached King
[9:41] of Kings that we find that the world
[9:45] when they see him at the end of the
[9:47] tribulation they don't wail because of
[9:51] the tribulation plagues and that's an
[9:54] important point they wail because that
[9:57] when they see him it's obvious they're
[10:00] doomed it's very obvious that they have
[10:03] chosen the wrong path it's now very
[10:06] obvious to all of the naysayers and the
[10:10] atheist and the agnostics and the and
[10:13] the the the you know the godless
[10:17] societies and governments of the world
[10:19] in their liberal nasira's but they're
[10:28] now whaling because now they as they say
[10:31] the proof is in the pudding there he is
[10:34] they they haven't had no remedy for the
[10:37] three and a half years of Jacob's
[10:39] trouble they've had no remedy for Moses
[10:42] and Elijah they finally killed him but
[10:44] then they didn't even stay dead they
[10:46] resurrected right in front of the whole
[10:47] world on satellite television no less
[10:50] and so the world at this point when they
[10:54] see him they're already as low as human
[10:57] history has ever been or could ever be
[10:59] and yet even with all of that low point
[11:02] and that low hour we find them wailing
[11:06] further because of him and so we find
[11:10] that the one who was the faithful
[11:13] witness he was the first begotten of the
[11:16] Dead he's the prince of all kings he's
[11:19] the Alpha the Omega he's the beginning
[11:21] in the ending he's the Lord and and and
[11:25] saith the Lord which is he's he which is
[11:29] which was and which is to come he is the
[11:32] Almighty that is a revelation that is
[11:36] going to strike the whole world and all
[11:39] of the people who have dogged Lee
[11:41] contended that he is a trinity of
[11:44] persons are going to find out that's not
[11:47] true and when they realize that they
[11:50] have misled their people and mislead
[11:53] their families they're going to wail
[11:55] because the evidence will be painfully
[11:59] before their eyes now when we begin to
[12:05] look at this book now let me just take
[12:08] some other steps here Wow while I while
[12:12] I move into this thought give me one
[12:14] second here to find where I need to be
[12:18] alright got it now so when you look at
[12:26] when you begin to look at the book of
[12:28] Revelation it becomes extremely
[12:31] imperative that you understand the
[12:35] purpose of the book of Revelation and I
[12:39] want to dis make some lead-in comments
[12:41] so to give you some understanding now we
[12:46] know that that you know the book of
[12:49] Revelation is an unveiling
[12:51] it's an uncovering you know where I I
[12:55] heard brother Bisco many years ago use
[12:58] an example of back in the day in the in
[13:00] the golden era Golden Age and and they
[13:04] were you know bringing out new model
[13:07] cars and you know they didn't have
[13:09] social media and they didn't have all
[13:10] the access to the internet and
[13:12] everything that they had and and so we
[13:16] find that that they would bring a car
[13:19] out and it would have a covering over it
[13:21] now the car was already there it just
[13:24] had a shroud over it you couldn't see
[13:26] what it was they kept it secret there
[13:29] wasn't all of the internet social media
[13:31] for spy shots and things like that back
[13:34] then they managed to keep a lid on it
[13:35] pretty good and they would have these
[13:37] big car shows and they would roll it out
[13:39] under a cover those of us who are old
[13:42] enough to appreciate those days even I
[13:44] was a child back in that era but I
[13:47] remember that that was the how they
[13:50] brought it out and so you know you could
[13:52] you could you could walk up and touch
[13:55] perhaps and you could feel
[13:58] the car you could fit you could tell it
[14:00] was a car you could feel the mirror and
[14:02] say you know that's not it's not exactly
[14:04] like last year's model you could come
[14:06] around and say oh I feel that it looks
[14:09] like they went with rounded headlights
[14:11] rather than square headlights like last
[14:13] year's model it looks like the trunk the
[14:15] deck lid is larger and wider and the
[14:17] lines feel a little different
[14:19] you could get some semblance of it but
[14:23] you really you could only probe at it
[14:25] you only had one sense that you could
[14:27] touch it by eye - for your touch that
[14:30] you could sense it by was your touch but
[14:32] when they uncovered it just like I can
[14:36] have a covering over this mic and and
[14:39] you might could tell that it's a
[14:41] microphone you could feel it and feel
[14:42] kind of what it's like but when I
[14:44] uncover it now you actually see it
[14:47] that's the principle behind the book of
[14:50] Revelation give me my powerpoint
[14:52] brothers before that I'm gonna use for
[14:54] the sunday-school
[14:55] I want you to look at these examples gee
[14:57] man if you will operate that for me
[14:59] because I'm not pulling up my remote
[15:01] this is the book of Revelation and
[15:03] here's my first PowerPoint I'm going to
[15:06] call it low resolution versus high
[15:09] resolution because what I'll tell you
[15:11] into advanced G and so so we find out
[15:15] that God has always been a mysterious
[15:20] being the Bible talks about how that he
[15:22] dwells in unapproachable light no man
[15:25] hath seen him at any time and the only
[15:28] begotten of the Father hath declared him
[15:30] so Jesus begins to declare what God
[15:33] would look like and act like and be like
[15:36] as a man because he was a god man he was
[15:40] the very God living that very God living
[15:44] in a human body that was a spoken word
[15:47] creation of God now he was a man fully
[15:50] because we had to have a kinsman
[15:53] redeemer he couldn't be as the Gnostics
[15:55] and Gnosticism tried to suggest that he
[15:58] was an apparition or perhaps he was an
[16:00] angel no that wouldn't have given us a
[16:03] kinsman he had to be a human being this
[16:06] is the mystery of the Godhead how that
[16:08] how that Christ could be fully a human
[16:12] he could be fully God and that's why the
[16:14] Prophet said he was he was God he was
[16:18] man plus and he was the god man and so
[16:23] he wasn't exactly you know like Solomon
[16:26] or Solomon portrayed him but he wasn't
[16:28] exactly like Solomon he was man plus he
[16:31] was the god man and so we find in that
[16:34] down through the ages from the fall in
[16:37] the Garden of Eden God has slowly and
[16:40] and gradually over over millennia
[16:44] revealed himself more and more and more
[16:47] now we look at these low I want to show
[16:50] you an example here give me my first
[16:52] slide brother Gideon so now for those in
[16:55] the back you might not be able to see it
[16:57] but I imagine you can see it online you
[17:00] can see that you're looking at the exact
[17:02] same picture but the picture on the
[17:05] right side is in low-res the picture on
[17:08] the left side is in high risk they are
[17:10] the same image but the high-resolution
[17:14] picture you're able to discern
[17:17] infinitely more detail over the blurry I
[17:21] can get the outline I can even see the
[17:23] colors on the right side I can get kind
[17:26] of the the you know what's what's
[17:28] adjacent to what and I can get a little
[17:31] bit of depth perceptions but when I go
[17:33] to the left side to a high resolution
[17:36] video suddenly that image that I had a
[17:39] partial understanding of now becomes
[17:42] visible next slide brother Gideon here's
[17:45] another example the building on the
[17:46] right you can see the buildings below it
[17:49] the bit you've got the skyscraper than
[17:51] the buildings below it and you see a lot
[17:53] of pixelation now the image on the right
[17:56] and the image on the left are not images
[18:00] of a different property they are exactly
[18:03] the same property even taken from the
[18:06] exact same angle at the exact same time
[18:09] one is taken right behind another and
[18:12] right side is low resolution
[18:15] left side is high resolution lot next
[18:18] image brother giddy now we're gonna see
[18:20] a little bit more gradual you can see on
[18:23] the right side here's a yellow rose
[18:25] with a very low resolution and I can see
[18:29] it's a flower I can tell that it's a
[18:31] rose I can tell it's a yellow rose but I
[18:34] really can't appreciate that so much
[18:37] until I go from very low to low now I
[18:40] can start to appreciate it just a little
[18:42] bit more I can see a little more
[18:44] definition but yet still the very one to
[18:47] the far left is high resolution now I
[18:50] can see much finer crisper detail and
[18:54] and that's Andhra and high resolution
[18:58] you can just keep going up and up and up
[19:00] you can you can use micro lenses to
[19:04] capture very zoomed in intricate and
[19:08] then high-res that image and friends
[19:11] it's almost limitless then from there
[19:13] you can take that high resolution image
[19:16] and even from from from a micro lens and
[19:19] high res then you could put it under a
[19:22] microscope and see all the way down into
[19:25] the into the very essence of its
[19:28] creation you know what a microscope what
[19:30] a microscope would show you would
[19:33] literally go down into the fibers of the
[19:36] of the petals themselves and you would
[19:38] get amazing detail that you don't see
[19:41] they have tremendous cameras today that
[19:45] can take a picture of your arm you don't
[19:47] ever want to do it because crawling up
[19:50] and down your arm are the most ghoulish
[19:51] looking little bitty creatures you don't
[19:54] know they're there
[19:55] don't bother going to take a quick
[19:57] shower because when you do that you make
[19:59] them worse don't ask me why I'm not a
[20:02] scientist but they're on your body right
[20:05] now they have a purpose their little
[20:07] living creatures at the microscopic
[20:09] level and they're there just because you
[20:12] can't see them or feel them or detect
[20:15] them in any way they're still there and
[20:18] a super high intensity microscope lens
[20:23] can see they're there that's what the
[20:26] message of the hour has done God comes
[20:30] out of them out of the book of Genesis
[20:32] and you'll find him in a very low
[20:35] resolution way take that down get
[20:38] that's all I have for the slides go back
[20:41] to fullscreen and we find that that
[20:44] you-you-you can find where God is
[20:46] revealing himself to Abraham you can
[20:51] find that in the in the book of Genesis
[20:52] and he reveals himself to Abraham in in
[20:58] beautiful and wonderful ways how that
[21:00] how that he's the God who's a provider
[21:03] how that he's the he's the God who's a
[21:05] pen durand a protector he's the Almighty
[21:08] Abraham recognizes him as the Almighty
[21:12] but it's interesting that when you come
[21:16] to the book of Exodus chapter 6
[21:19] brother Gideon can you find Exodus
[21:21] chapter 6 sorry that to jump you I
[21:24] didn't put that in the that I would do
[21:26] that but if you can get Exodus chapter 6
[21:28] from memory I don't have it in front of
[21:30] me but I believe it's verse 3 Gideon
[21:32] Exodus chapter 6 look at this amazing
[21:35] statement and I appeared under Abraham
[21:38] unto Isaac and unto Jacob this is three
[21:41] generations by the name of God Almighty
[21:45] but by my name Jehovah was I not known
[21:50] to them now that's interesting and it's
[21:53] not to suggest that they didn't know who
[21:56] Jehovah was because it's the same name
[21:59] when you look in thee it's it's the Lord
[22:02] Almighty it's God Almighty and so we
[22:05] find out them that then how do you
[22:07] explain that he's saying by Jehovah I
[22:11] was not known it's not a reference to
[22:14] understanding or hearing a name or even
[22:17] understanding it doctrinally what the
[22:19] name means or who it is but but it is it
[22:22] is a manifestation because now God is in
[22:27] it is is in Egypt and he's going to
[22:30] deliver his children and so he he says
[22:33] to Moses now now I'm going to manifest
[22:37] myself in a further way not a way that
[22:41] I'd manifested to Abraham when I met him
[22:43] because Jehovah has this meaning God
[22:48] dwelling with his family now
[22:52] comes to Abraham there's no family
[22:54] Abraham has a promise of a family and
[22:57] when we find even through Isaac and
[22:59] Jacob it's starting to grow a little bit
[23:01] but nothing like it would be four
[23:04] hundred and thirty years later when
[23:06] there's two two million plus two million
[23:11] plus family members and so now God says
[23:15] to Moses I was never made known as one
[23:18] dwelling with my family I didn't make
[23:21] myself known to Abraham like that but
[23:23] I'm doing it now Moses you're seeing a
[23:26] further I'm not a different person Moses
[23:29] you're seeing a greater manifestation of
[23:32] me you're just simply seeing and
[23:34] continuation now the time has come for
[23:37] me to further reveal myself through
[23:41] manifestation now that's exactly what he
[23:44] did in the days of Jesus because he was
[23:48] revealing himself in the lives of the
[23:51] prophets in the apartment of the
[23:52] prophets and the priests and the kings
[23:54] but we find that all of that word that
[23:58] that that that that all down through the
[24:00] Old Testament he formed that body
[24:04] through by the prophets and the prophets
[24:07] laid out what the Messiah would do and
[24:10] how he would come and and and the
[24:12] suffering he would go through the
[24:14] prophets wrote about all of that and so
[24:18] the prophets now watch the prophets then
[24:21] formed the word that Jesus of Nazareth
[24:26] stepped into and became a manifestation
[24:29] of that word I'm sure you follow that
[24:32] and so so now then we we see that that
[24:36] even that even now Christ is the
[24:39] manifestation of the Old Testament
[24:40] that's why when he went into the grave
[24:42] he didn't just go into the grave and
[24:44] immediately raise up first before he
[24:47] ascended the Bible tells us he first
[24:49] descended into the lower parts of the
[24:51] earth and gathered all of those who he
[24:55] had made a promise in Abraham that this
[24:58] is what will happen and all of those
[25:00] Jews who believed him not all the great
[25:02] were opened the Bible doesn't say on his
[25:05] resurrection that all the graves robinus
[25:07] says many which slept arose but not all
[25:10] brother Branham shows us who was it that
[25:12] rose it was those who had been faithful
[25:15] and had followed the faith and had
[25:17] followed the word that God had given
[25:19] them even though it was limited they
[25:21] didn't have Jesus they didn't have the
[25:23] full measure but they had the prophets
[25:25] they had the priest they had the Kings
[25:27] and then Jesus Christ comes on the scene
[25:30] and the elected family of Abraham saw it
[25:33] Peter John James Bartholomew Matthew
[25:36] they all start catching the revelation
[25:39] many are following him and we find in
[25:42] that on the Mount of Olives
[25:44] you know there's better than 500
[25:46] believers they go and then by the time
[25:48] he comes up a room there's 120 people
[25:50] still waiting and and then the church is
[25:53] born now what is he doing he's now
[25:56] creating a further understanding of
[25:59] himself but we realized then that that
[26:02] first original full understanding was
[26:06] lost because Paul warned the church that
[26:09] it would be and it was we can look on
[26:12] history and now comes the book of
[26:14] Revelation which was a book brought back
[26:17] to the church after Paul was gone it's
[26:19] not now you don't want to get the idea
[26:21] that the book of Revelation is knowledge
[26:24] that Paul didn't have because we have
[26:27] found in the opening of the book of
[26:29] Revelation in the unveiling of the
[26:31] mighty God in this last day that
[26:33] everything the book of Revelation
[26:35] teaches not only was it taught by st.
[26:38] Paul and all the other deposits it was
[26:41] taught in Genesis it was taught in the
[26:44] Gospels there's nothing that you can
[26:47] find no doctor no teaching in the book
[26:51] of nothing that the book of Revelation
[26:53] reveals is not founded in seed version
[26:57] in the book of Genesis because Genesis
[27:00] is the seed chapter you begin to get
[27:03] this idea and I'm just winding up my
[27:05] Sunday School class now you begin to get
[27:07] this idea that you you realize that when
[27:11] God you know who who comes through
[27:15] Genesis
[27:16] he's already laying the seed for
[27:18] everything that he will do that's how
[27:20] his family was in him before Genesis 1:1
[27:25] because in Genesis 1:1 say you can't go
[27:28] back further than that oh you certainly
[27:29] can John 1:1 goes further than Genesis
[27:33] 1:1 Genesis 1:1 is when God created the
[27:37] heavens in the earth but the Bible tells
[27:39] us that our names were in the Lamb's
[27:41] Book of Life before the foundation of
[27:44] the world and so we realize that the
[27:47] book of Revelation now is on is a is is
[27:50] going to cover the history of the church
[27:53] it's going to show those first three
[27:55] chapters cover everything that Paul said
[27:58] would happen the first three chapters of
[28:01] Revelation show it happen you go back in
[28:03] history and overlay those first three
[28:05] chapters you can see how it happened
[28:06] perfectly and then when you come brother
[28:09] Brandon would say now the church goes up
[28:11] at the end of chapter 3 you don't see
[28:13] her again
[28:14] until chapter 19 when she comes riding
[28:17] white horses following the king of kings
[28:19] and Lord of lords now say well wait a
[28:22] minute if we don't see the the church
[28:25] after chapter 3 then what's all of
[28:26] what's it all about in chapter 5 and a
[28:29] strong angel proclaiming who's worthy
[28:31] and John standing there representing the
[28:33] bride and he comes to take a book what's
[28:35] all that about in Revelation 10 the
[28:36] mighty angel and the seventh angel and
[28:38] eating the book what's that all about
[28:40] brother Brandon explains that that the
[28:43] first three chapters show the history of
[28:47] his church show the fulfillment of what
[28:50] Paul warned would happen and it did
[28:52] happen and then chapter four the church
[28:55] goes up and she goes straight up in the
[28:57] rapture and there's a spiritual side to
[29:00] that but he says now beginning in
[29:02] Chapter five he said he's going to begin
[29:05] to show you how he did it how he pulled
[29:09] it off how he kept his church through
[29:11] seven ages through two thousand years
[29:13] he's going to begin in chapter five all
[29:15] the way through to show how he redeemed
[29:18] her out of each age how he came to the
[29:20] last day and revealed himself in an
[29:23] opening of the mysteries of God in an
[29:25] opening of the seals and that's why and
[29:28] then
[29:28] shows how that that mystery that that
[29:31] mystery revealed is the is the vehicle
[29:35] that will carry us into a body changed
[29:39] just like the camels which represented
[29:41] the word carried Rebecca to meet Isaac
[29:44] the word carries us to meet him in the
[29:47] air just like when Rebecca came to meet
[29:50] him he had left his tent he came out
[29:52] into the field she was coming she didn't
[29:55] and they met in the middle and so we
[29:58] meet him in the air by the revelation of
[30:00] this word that's why the book of
[30:03] Revelation is the bride's book
[30:06] specifically and uniquely the bride's
[30:10] book of the last day it is the book that
[30:14] unlocks to us the rapture mystery it is
[30:17] the book that gives us high-definition
[30:21] resolution that we don't see God in
[30:24] low-res we see them in high-res we don't
[30:26] see the world the world is fit is filled
[30:29] with fear and anxiety because they
[30:31] everything they see say don't they see
[30:32] it they do but they don't sit they don't
[30:35] see it clearly we that's the beauty of
[30:38] the opening of the book of Revelation in
[30:41] this last day is it gives us
[30:44] high-definition vision and when you can
[30:46] see it friends oh yeah that's where
[30:49] peace comes because you can see clearly
[30:51] what's happening why it's happening and
[30:53] you are very much aware that it's God in
[30:56] control of it all amen god bless you
[30:59] that'll complete our first lesson we're
[31:01] going to do as I said at the beginning
[31:02] I'm planning to take the Sunday schools
[31:05] for the next while maybe the rest of the
[31:07] year if it takes me I don't know but I
[31:09] want to do a study on the entire book of
[31:12] Revelation today we were just laying
[31:15] some groundwork so god bless you and we
[31:17] will have a short intermission and the
[31:20] regular service should begin probably
[31:22] within the next five or seven minutes
[31:24] god bless you
