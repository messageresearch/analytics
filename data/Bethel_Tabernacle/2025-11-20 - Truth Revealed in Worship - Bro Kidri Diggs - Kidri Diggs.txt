[applause] tears and sorrows, questions for [music and singing] tomorrow. There were times I didn't know right [music] from wrong. But in every [music and singing] situation, God gave blessed consolation that my trials [music and singing] only come to make me strong. Through it all, [singing] through it all, I've learned to trust in Jesus. [music] I've learned to trust in God. [music] Through it all, [music] through it all, [singing] I've learned [music] to depend upon his word. I've been a lot of [singing] places, [music] seen a lot of faces, yet there were times I [music] felt [singing] so all alone. But in my lonely hours, [music and singing] those precious lonely hours, Jesus let me know I was [music and singing] his own. Through it all, through [music and singing] it all, I've learned to trust in Jesus. I've learned to trust in God. Through it [singing] all, through [music] it all, I've learned [singing] to depend upon his word. [music] Now I thank him for the mountains. Thank him for the [singing] valleys. Thank him for the storms he's [music] brought me through. Cuz if I never had a problem, I wouldn't know [music] how well God solves [singing] them. I'd never know what faith in his word can do. [music] Through it all, [singing] through it all, [music and singing] I've learned to trust in Jesus. I've learned to trust in [music and singing] God. Through it all. Through it [music and singing] all, I've learned to depend [music] upon his word. Oh [singing] yes, I've learned to depend upon his word. &gt;&gt; [applause and music] &gt;&gt; God bless you. You can just play something softly, Brother Andrew. We're going to invite Brother Diggs to come. Amen. How many's looking forward to the word? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Wanted to just uh take a second. And I didn't get to do this Sunday. So I told brother Tony I wanted to tonight [music] um to tell about just an awesome testimony just before brother Digs comes out. Really just a [music] testimony that proves the mercy of God that uh the Lord never gives up. You know we give up on ourselves. We can give up on people. But there's one thing that's true. The Bible says that even when we're not faithful, he remains faithful. &gt;&gt; Amen. and his [music] mercy always comes after us. You remember the man who was here this Sunday uh came and splusted us with a special brother Marcus Turner. He is from Raleigh uh Durham area, North Carolina and it was real special having him um come [music] and uh last goodness I get I don't I'm so bad bad with dates. maybe a month and a half, two months ago, something like that, whenever it was right before camp, I had the honor to go and minister uh [music] the special meetings there. Brother Tim Puitz, myself, Brother Ron Spencer, and Brother Andrew Spencer. And um the evening that we were going to church [music] uh to Brother Ron Spencer was going to speak, we stayed in all of a house together and was able to have great fellowship um [clears throat] while we [music] were there. And so, Brother Ron was up in the front seat on the way to church and he says, "Brother Matthew says, there's this very special man here." He says, "I want you to meet." And he says just [music] an incredible testimony. I said, "Who is it?" He said, "His name is Brother Marcus Turner." He said, um, he is his first time ever coming to travel to be in meetings where I'm going to be. He's traveled here. [music] And he said, I tell you about the mercy of God. He said, 20 I think I get these dates wrong, but I think it was 23 years ago. He said, "23 years ago, I was coming back &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; uh preaching from a preaching trip." He said, "I was still in my suit, sweaty." And he said, "And the airline put me uh on a window seat beside a person who had too much alcohol." And he said just a chatter box. Guy was [music] just um just just chattering away. Wouldn't stop talking. And um and he said finally, you know, the whole ride, he said, "Finally, [music] the very end of the flight, he looked at me and said, "What do you do for a living?" and brother Ron said the first time I had a chance to speak the whole flight and he said well I'm a preacher [music] and he said really he said what do you preach he said well I preach the message of William Brandon and he said oh and [music] they kept talking was they were landing the man on the aisle who had been very quiet throughout the whole flight got brother Ron's attention [music] and he said sir he said um he said I used to be a message believer he said I used and he said really he said yeah I'm still a believer he [music] said but I'm just not in church he said I haven't been for many years. His life had just been real terrible. A lot of suffering, a lot of [music] um you know, you don't know what someone's you might look at them and judge them from the outside, but you don't know what's behind some of their life story. And that [music] brother has lived a life of a lot of tragedy, a lot of sorrow, things that you couldn't imagine. And uh anyway, he told brother Ronnie, he said, "I haven't been serving the Lord." He said, "I I think it's incredible [music] that I'm sitting beside a man who's a message preacher." And he said, you know, he said, ' And I'm out of fellowship with the Lord. And through that little airplane ride, [music] Brother Ron led that man back to the Lord Jesus. And as they got off the flight, as they got off in the terminal, Brother Ron said, you know, let's exchange numbers. I want to [music] get your contact. And this is 23 years ago. They didn't have cell phones, uh, you know, he could exchange. And [music] so he they get off the terminal and they lose track. He couldn't find him. He he looked everywhere. Brother Ron said he looked and looked and looked and looked and couldn't find him and was really bothered. said, "Man, Lord, why'd you, you know, let that happen? I really wanted to h I just got this man, you know, wanted to help him, see if I could set him right in his life, and, you know, just his life had fallen apart and crumbled." And Ron said, "I [music] lost track of him." He said, "Brother Maddie," he said, "The only thing I knew to do," he said, "Every special meeting that I would preach at," he said, "I would, before I'd preach, I'd say, if there's a man here in the building that I met on a plane, United Airlines, I I'm that preacher. Come and see me." And, uh, he said he did that for, I think, 15 years. and finally just stopped. Never met the man. [music] In that interim time of 23 years, I believe his sister, it was his youngest sister, I think, I could tell that wrong, but it was his sister that said had had been attending brother [music] Ron's church. And uh and so brother Marcus had went to visit her or something to that something to that effect. Could get again [music] this detail wrong, but whatever it was, somehow she got Marcus to come to church. Now, he has no recollection or memory of Ron Spencer, who the man was he met on the plane, but he's there at the church in the fellowship. Paul came to [music] church and uh and and brother Ron, they were it just so happened that he got sat at brother Ron's table in the fellowship hall. Brother Ron said he was sitting there eating. He said, "A voice whispered in his in his ear and said, "The man you were looking for for those many years is sitting at your table." And he said, "I looked over at the man and thought, that's the man." And he said, I looked at him and said, "Sir, we've met before." And Marcus said, "No, sir, we've never met before. You got me confused with someone else." And brother [music] Ron said, "Airl." And he said, "When he said that, all of the memory." And he said, "Are you that preacher?" He said, "Yes, sir. That was me." And brother Ron got up on the on the the microphone they have there and said, "I want to announce the man I was looking for for 23 years is sitting here tonight at my table." And that restored that man back to the fellowship. Has been going to church serving the Lord ever since. And he told me that story Saturday [music] night before he preached. And at the sermon Saturday, Brother Ron had brother Marcus stand up as he told some testimonies. [music] And I watched uh Brother Marcus there just weep as brother Ron told it. Sunday morning I [music] spoke and um and brother Ron uh you know after I had to fly back because we had youth camp coming and brother Ron at the end of this [music] you know I spoke Sunday morning at the fellowship hall. I could eat really quick before I had to catch a flight. And brother Ron said, "Brother Matthew, did you get to meet Marcus?" I said, "No." I said, "I didn't get to meet him." He said, "Where is he?" So they're looking around for him. They can't find the man looking everywhere. Couldn't find him. I said, "I'm sorry, brother Ron. Maybe I'll just get a chance to meet him some other time." He said, "Oh, I want you to meet him so bad." About that time, Aaron Obsby said, "Brother Matt, you're going to miss your flight. [music] Let's go." So I got upgraded. Let me just tell you, for free your status, get you get some good things. I didn't pay for it, but I got upgraded the first class. And so I was getting on the flight. I was very wiped out. We'd went the weekend before, [music] just very tired. And so I sat in first class and and I immediately, never done this before, fell asleep. Put AirPods, [music] turned on the sermon of brother Brandham and just fell just blacked out. The steartus woke me up, said, "Sir, do you want a drink?" I said, "Yeah, I'll take a club soda." So I'm sitting there drinking my club soda, listening. And in my peripheral vision, I'm on the aisle and the man sitting to my left has a I see a phone that is like doing this. And I'm thinking, who is trying to [music] get my attention? And I and the phone's doing this. And finally, I look over and on the phone is me preaching that morning the replay. And now my brain didn't catch it for a minute. I thought, "What is happening? Why is there a person in first class watching me preach?" I looked over [music] and it's Brother Marcus and his eyes are about this big. And he goes, I changed my clothes. I was in casual. He said, "Is that you?" And I said, "Yeah." He goes, "Oh Lord, these plane rides have got to stop." [laughter] And he started weeping and and he started telling me those next two hours. He told me his whole life story. [music] I can't explain it, but God [clears throat] just put a special connection there. I was able just to be a blessing to him. He was a blessing to me. I prayed with him there at the terminal. [music] And ever since that day, we've been texting back and forth. Tell you what, friends, that is the [music] mercy that rewrites life. So, are you glad for that? Stand to your feet tonight. Give the Lord a good hand clap of praise for his grace. Thank you, Lord. [applause] Amen. We're excited to have Brother Diggs here. He's He's like one of us. So, you just make yourself feel at home. Mercy re [music] [singing] my life. Could you raise your hands? Sing it now like a testimony. God's mercy [music] reroll my life. [music] Oh, I should have I should have fallen [music] my soul [singing] cast down. my life. [music] Mercy, mercy all my life. Your mercy [music] broke my life. I have fallen. [music] My soul cast down by mercy [music] all my life. Amen. Praise the Lord. Good to be home again. Amen. Feel like I've been all the way around the world since we've been together. But God is good. Amen. I certainly appreciate testimonies like that cuz it shows no matter where you go or what you may do, God has always got [music] his eyes on you. &gt;&gt; Amen. You know, the prophet of God said when that eagle laid, it knew how many eggs it laid and it [music] searched for the one until it found it. Amen. And he said that's like the Holy Spirit. God knows who has his seed and he'll send the Holy Spirit out to get every last one of us. Amen. We thank God for being here. We certainly appreciate Pastor Jason. Amen. Let's just have a word of prayer and we'll get right into the word of God. Lord Jesus, Father, we just thank you for the grace that you've given us, Lord. and &gt;&gt; your everlasting mercy, Lord, even when we don't deserve it, &gt;&gt; Lord God, and we run from you, Lord, and we try to live our own life, Lord, that you leave that mercy there, Lord. You leave that grace there, Lord. That favor, Lord, that unmmerited favor, Lord. And we thank you, Lord, for just keeping [music] your eyes on the sparrow, Lord, in our in our lives, Lord, even when we don't even realize, Lord, that you're watching over us, Lord. You're protecting, Lord, and you're keeping the enemy at bay. So, Lord, we appreciate you so much. And we pray that tonight, Lord, that you would dominate the service, Lord, our our minds, our spirits, Lord, down to the depths of our innermost being, Lord. Take full control, [music] Lord, and forgive us for everything that's not like you, Lord, and purge us, Lord, and continue to mold us into the image of your mind. In the great [music] and holy name of Jesus Christ, we pray. Church, say, "Amen." &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen. If you have your Bibles, let's turn to um St. John chapter 4. Again, we just appreciate you all so much. You know, all that you do, your prayers, support so many different ways. You know, those who are here, those who are online. Amen. God is good. &gt;&gt; St. John chapter 4, let's start at verse 21. St. John 4 and 21 Jesus saith unto heroman believe me the hour cometh when ye shall neither in this mountain nor yet at Jerusalem worship the Father ye worship ye know not what we know what we worship for salvation is of the Jews but the hour cometh and now is when The true worshipper shall worship the father in spirit and in truth. For the father seeketh such to worship him. God is a spirit and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth. &gt;&gt; Amen. May the Lord have a blessed reader of his word. You can have your seats. Amen. Praise the Lord. Tonight by the by the grace of God I want to use for a subject truth revealed in worship. &gt;&gt; You know just the the the word worship it can go so many different ways, you know, because everybody has their own idea of what they think worship is. But tonight I I kind of want to look at it from a different way. Amen. You know, but uh the Bible says that God is a spirit and for any of us to worship, we must worship him in spirit and in truth. &gt;&gt; But church, I want to say that when it comes to worship, our greatest hindrance is something that I it it really not God is not really dealing with when it comes to worship. BUT YOU KNOW, ONE OF OUR GREATEST HINDRANCES when it comes to worship is sound. &gt;&gt; And when WE SPEAK OF WORSHIP, WORSHIP IS NOT BASED UPON SOUND. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; BECAUSE CHURCH, IF WE GO IN IN IN the in the word and uh before I get to going, you know, the prophet when they when when when he talked about worship, listen what he said. He said, "I LIKE TO WORSHIP." CAN I GET AMEN? &gt;&gt; I LIKE TO WORSHIP. HE SAYS, "DON'T YOU?" HE SAYS, "NOW, WE DON'T COME TO CHURCH JUST TO HEAR A SERMON." WOW. [laughter] &gt;&gt; NOW, THAT'S A SHOCKER FOR A LOT OF CHURCH PEOPLE. AMEN. &gt;&gt; THAT WE, YOU KNOW, FOR YEARS, WE'VE SAID BECAUSE OF THE REVELATION OF THE word and and you know, the end time message and what the prophet HAS BROUGHT FORTH, WE COME AND SAY, "I GOT THE WORD. &gt;&gt; I COME TO HEAR the word." AND NOW THE PROPHET IS SAYING, "WE DON'T COME HERE ONLY JUST TO HEAR A SERMON." &gt;&gt; RIGHT? AMEN. &gt;&gt; SO YOUR WORSHIP, AMEN, IS VERY IMPORTANT. HE SAYS, "WE DON'T COME HERE JUST TO HEAR A SERMON. THAT GOES WITH IT. BUT WE COME TO CHURCH TO WORSHIP." &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; I hope I hope y'all didn't think I was going to let you get by WITH THAT. WE DON'T COME TO CHURCH JUST TO HEAR THE WORD PREACH, &gt;&gt; BUT WE COME TO WORSHIP. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; That's kind of weak, but we going to keep going. &gt;&gt; He says, "BUT WE COME TO CHURCH TO WORSHIP. WORSHIP IN SPIRIT AND IN TRUTH. You've heard the truth." AMEN. &gt;&gt; THAT'S THE WORD. SEE, WE'VE HEARD THE TRUTH OVER AND OVER AND OVER. SO, WE GOT THE WORD. AMEN. &gt;&gt; WE GOT THE WORD. BUT THEN HE SAYS, HE SAYS THAT'S THE WORD. SEE NOW TO WORSHIP IS TO EXPRESS YOURSELF to him. &gt;&gt; NOW THAT'S WHERE WE WANT TO GO CHURCH. WE WANT TO WE WANT TO EXAMINE OURSELVES AND SAY THAT WHEN WE COME TO CHURCH, ARE YOU EXPRESSING YOURSELF? &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. NOW I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT JUMPING AND SHOUTING, KICKING AND HOLLERING, BUT I'M TALKING ABOUT YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH GOD. &gt;&gt; OR BETTER YET, WHAT'S YOUR IMAGE OF GOD? BECAUSE UH THE PROPHET OF GOD SAID THAT THE WORD GOD MEANS AN OBJECT OF WORSHIP. &gt;&gt; SO IF WE'RE HERE TONIGHT AND WE'RE WORSHIPING, THERE HAS TO BE AN OBJECT THAT YOU'RE LOOKING AT. &gt;&gt; THERE HAS TO BE AN OBJECT THAT YOU'RE BELIEVING IN. AMEN. AND A LOT OF TIMES PEOPLE DON'T WORSHIP BECAUSE THEY DON'T BELIEVE THAT THEY'RE IN THE PRESENCE OF GOD. MY AND WE'LL WE'LL WE'LL WE'LL LAY THE WORSHIP ON ALL KIND OF THINGS, YOU KNOW. Oh man, brother Tony didn't SING MY SONG. THAT AIN'T GOT NOTHING TO DO WITH IT. &gt;&gt; YOU SAY, "WELL, WELL, WELL, CHRIS WASN'T BEATING THE DRUMS, RIGHT?" THAT AIN'T GOT NOTHING TO DO WITH IT. &gt;&gt; YOU SAY, "WELL, THEY DIDN'T HIT THE KEY RIGHT." NO, THAT'S SOUND. THAT'S NOT WORSHIP. &gt;&gt; WORSHIP IS THE EXPRESSION, HALLELUJAH, OF WHAT YOU BELIEVE IN GOD. WHAT GOD HAS BEEN REVEALED UNTO YOU. AMEN. &gt;&gt; NOW, we going to go somewhere. Hallelujah. AND I KNOW YOU MAY BE LOOKING AT me and YOU SAY, "MAN, HE'S REAL RADICAL AND ALL THIS STUFF." YOU KNOW, OUR OWN PERSONALITIES HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH IT. &gt;&gt; WORSHIP IS [screaming] A REVELATION. &gt;&gt; SOMETHING THAT HAS BEEN REVEALED TO YOU. &gt;&gt; AND THE ONE WE COME TO WORSHIP IS WHO? JESUS. &gt;&gt; SO, AMEN. YOUR REVELATION OF CHRIST SHOULD BE UH EXPRESSED IN YOUR WORSHIP. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Oh my. AND I KNOW THAT WHEN IT COMES TO WORSHIP AND PRAISE AND ALL THESE THINGS THAT IT'S A TOUCHY AREA. KEEP IN MIND I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT SOUND. &gt;&gt; Come on. [laughter] &gt;&gt; Cuz some of you WANT TO LOCK YOU WANT TO LOCK ME INTO THAT. YOU THINKING ABOUT SOUND. YOU THINKING ABOUT BLUEG GRASS AND purple grass and all kind of grass &gt;&gt; and country AND GOSPEL AND HIP HOP AND ALL. NO, I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT THAT. I'M TALKING ABOUT A LIFE. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. NOW, don't get me wrong, THE PIANO, KEYBOARD, ALL THAT STUFF, IT PLAYS A PART. &gt;&gt; BUT I WANT YOU TO UNDERSTAND, THERE'S A PERSON MAKING THE SOUND. HALLELUJAH. Oh my. SO HE SAID WORSHIP IS THE EXPRESSION HALLELUJAH OF GOD. &gt;&gt; NOW LOOK IF WE GO INTO IT LET'S LOOK AT SOME OF THE FIRST PLACES WHERE WE'VE SEEN WORSHIP. YOU KNOW THE BIBLE SAYS THAT GOD IN THE BEGINNING WOULD COME DOWN IN THE COOL OF the day. &gt;&gt; And in THE COOL OF THE DAY ADAM AND EVE WOULD DO WHAT? THEY WOULD WORSHIP GOD. I GUARANTEE YOU WITH ALL MY MIGHT, THERE WAS NO PIANO THERE. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; THERE WAS NO KEYBOARD THERE. &gt;&gt; SO WHAT WAS THE WORSHIP ALL ABOUT? IT WAS ABOUT HALLELUJAH. OH MY. &gt;&gt; THE REVELATION OF GOD BEING REVEALED RIGHT THERE IN FRONT OF THEM. AMEN. &gt;&gt; AND I GUARANTEE YOU, THEY DIDN'T JUST SIT THERE, BUT THEY OFFERED UP AN EXPRESSION TO GOD. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. WHY? BECAUSE HE WAS RIGHT THERE IN HIS IN THEIR MIDST. THINK ABOUT IT. DO YOU BELIEVE GOD IS HERE? &gt;&gt; Now ask yourself, did I worship like he was here? &gt;&gt; You say the music wasn't jumping. I ain't talking about the music. &gt;&gt; And I'mma keep doing that because some of you going to try to pull me. You know where the sound is and you know uh Aaron wasn't thump Aaron wasn't thumping loud enough. [laughter] Now I love a good thump. Now &gt;&gt; don't get me wrong now. I love some GOOD MUSIC. HALLELUJAH. BUT LET ME ASK YOU SOMETHING. IN YOUR CAR, IS THERE A PIANO? &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. WHEN YOU [screaming] ON YOUR JOB, YOU DON'T HAVE AN ORCHESTRA. &gt;&gt; AMEN. BUT WHEN YOU YOU MAY BE THINKING ABOUT GOD AND SOMETHING TOUCHES YOUR HEART AND YOU MAY LIFT UP YOUR HANDS AND DO WHAT? WORSHIP. WHAT IS THAT? THAT'S A REVELATION. THAT'S SOME TRUTH BEING REVEALED to you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. BUT AS WE LOOK CHURCH, LET WE SEE SOME OF THE SOME OF THE FIRST PLACES, HALLELUJAH, WHERE WORSHIP was given unto God. IT HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH A SOUND. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; It was all about life. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Now church, LOOK. ADAM AND EVE, GOD CAME DOWN AND THEY WORSHIPED HIM. &gt;&gt; NOW, WE'RE GOING to move AHEAD A LITTLE BIT FORWARD. ADAM AND [screaming] EVE HAD TWO BOYS, CAIN AND ABEL. AND THE BIBLE SAYS IN THE PROCESS OF TIME, THEY CAME UNTO GOD TO DO WHAT? OFFER SACRIFICE. &gt;&gt; AND WHAT WAS THE OFFERING OF SACRIFICE? IT WAS CONSIDERED A WHAT? WORSHIP. M HALLELUJAH. BUT IT WASN'T HOW GOOD THEY PLAYED THE INSTRUMENT. HALLELUJAH. IT WAS BASED UPON THE REVELATION OF THE SACRIFICE THEY OFFERED TO GOD. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; SO YOU SEE THESE TWO BOYS AND CAIN, HE COMES FIRST AND HE DOES WHAT? HE WORSHIP GOD. BUT HE WORSHIPS GOD BASED UPON HIS REVELATION. &gt;&gt; Still there were no drones beating. There was no keyboard. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What's that thing called? You play &gt;&gt; bro. &gt;&gt; There was no dough, bro. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; IT WAS BASED UPON A SURRENDERED LIFE. &gt;&gt; AND HERE COMES CAIN. NOW, HE WAS WILLING TO OFFER GOD A SACRIFICE OF PRAISE. BUT HIS SACRIFICE, &gt;&gt; WHAT HE OFFERED UP GOD, GOD DIDN'T WANT. &gt;&gt; WHAT HE OFFERED UP GOD DIDN'T MATCH UP TO THE LIFE OF WHAT GOD IS. &gt;&gt; HE MADE GOD SOME NICE, PRETTY, SHINY FRUIT. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. OR WHATEVER IT WAS. IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN SOME VEGETABLES OR WHATEVER IT WAS THAT HE OFFERED UP TO GOD. GOD. HALLELUJAH. SAID, "GET THAT MESS OUT OF HERE." &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Still had nothing to do with sound. &gt;&gt; NOW HE OFFERS UP AND GOD REJECTS HIS WORSHIP. AND NOW HERE COMES HIS BROTHER. HIS BROTHER COMES AND HE BEGINS TO LAY IT OUT. AMEN. NOW YOU LOOK AT WHAT HIS BROTHER DID. HIS BROTHER CAME TO GOD WITH WHAT? A life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. AND AS HE'S PULLING THAT LAMB, HE'S HE'S BRINGING IT IN AND HE'S BRINGING IT DOWN. AND IT GETS REAL MESSY SOMETIMES. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; SEE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN CAIN'S OFFERING AND ABEL'S OFFERING. ONE WAS MESSY AND ONE WAS PRETTY. &gt;&gt; And sometimes &gt;&gt; we don't give God worship because we want to stay cute and pretty. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Sometimes we don't, you know, and and I'm so sick of this, you know, we don't give God worship because I'm an introvert. &gt;&gt; I WONDER HOW MANY INTROVERTS GOING TO BE IN HEAVEN. &gt;&gt; You think you're GOING TO BE ABLE TO CONTROL YOUR WORSHIP IN HEAVEN? &gt;&gt; IMAGINE GOD. HALLELUJAH. THE ONE THAT DELIVERED US FROM EVERYTHING AND NOW WE MADE IT OVER. YOU IN HIS PRESENCE. YOU SAY, "WELL, GOD, THAT'S JUST NOT ME." &gt;&gt; YOU SAY, "WELL, GOD, I'M QUIET BY NATURE." &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. AGAIN, I'M NOT TRYING TO GET YOU TO JUMP AND SHOUT, BUT I WANT YOU TO UNDERSTAND, DO YOU REALLY EXPRESS WORSHIP TO GOD, &gt;&gt; OR DO YOU JUST GIVE HIM WHAT YOU THINK IS ACCEPTABLE? &gt;&gt; CAIN DID THAT. CAIN GAVE HIM WHAT HE THOUGHT WAS ACCEPTABLE AND GOD REJECTED IT. &gt;&gt; AND IT WAS THE FIRST FRUITS OF HIS OFFERING. IT WASN'T SOME OLD NASTY, DIRTY THINGS WITH WITH MAGGOTS AND AND ME DO ALL IN IT. IT WAS SOMETHING WORTHY. &gt;&gt; BUT IT WASN'T WORTHY ENOUGH TO REVEAL WHAT GOD'S LIFE IS. &gt;&gt; AND NOW HERE COMES CAIN. HERE COMES ABEL. ABEL HAS HALLELUJAH THE LAMB. HE'S BRINGING IT. AND THE PROPHET OF GOD SAY HE MAY GET A ROCK AND HE STARTED TO HACK ON IT AND BLOOD IS SHOOTING ALL OVER THE PLACE. LOOK AT THAT. LOOK AT THAT WORSHIP. WHAT WAS IT DOING? IT WAS REVEALING HALLELUJAH THAT GOD IS A FORGIVER. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; IT WAS ALSO REVEALING truth that Adam and Eve did something. Amen. &gt;&gt; OH MY. &gt;&gt; HIS WORSHIP STARTED TO BRING OUT SIN THAT WAS STANDING THERE AND IT ALSO BROUGHT OUT FORGIVENESS. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; THROUGH THE SAME SACRIFICIAL OFFERING. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. BY HIM GIVING OFFERING UP THAT LAMB. IT SHOWED CHURCH. HE WASN'T THERE WHEN GOD KILLED AN ANIMAL AND HIS MOTHER AND HIS FATHER WALKED OUT DRIPPING IN BLOOD. &gt;&gt; SO HOW DID HE PICK IT UP? IT WAS A REVELATION THAT HE GOT INTO WORSHIP. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; And what did it do? IT REVEALED THE LIFE. YOUR WORSHIP, MY WORSHIP. IT SHOULD BRING US BACK TO CHRIST. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. IT SHOULD SHOW AND IDENTIFY THE ONE THAT WE BELIEVE IN. &gt;&gt; NOW YOU THINK ABOUT IT. LOOK AT ABEL'S WORSHIP. WHAT DID IT DO? IT SHOWED IN HIS WORSHIP. IT SHOWED THE LIFE OF CHRIST ON DISPLAY BEFORE THERE WAS EVEN A DEATH, BURIAL, AND RESURRECTION. THAT'S RIGHT. &gt;&gt; And it said that his worship spoke of things to come. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; WHAT ABOUT US? &gt;&gt; WHAT ABOUT WHAT ABOUT WHAT ABOUT OUR WORSHIP? &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; WHAT DOES IT SPEAK OF? HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; DOES IT TELL WHO GOD IS? HOW GREAT HE IS AND WHAT HE'S DONE AND WHAT HE WILL DO OR ARE WE JUST SINGING SONGS? &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Oh my. If we see that and we look and we see what God did in this moment through Abel as Abel worship and God begin to reveal things to him and you can look and see Adam and Eve maybe on the side watching him as he's worshiping THEY MAY HALLELUJAH CAIN MAY have looked at it AND THOUGHT THAT'S TOO much &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; do we have TO DO ALL THAT I DON'T FEEL LIKE CLAPPING MY hands &gt;&gt; amen &gt;&gt; when THE BIBLE SAYS CLAP YE HANDS, ALL ye saints. &gt;&gt; WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME YOU CLAPPED YOUR HANDS IN CHURCH? &gt;&gt; That's what the BIBLE SAYS. DON'T PUT IT ON ME. THE BIBLE SAYS THAT THE PROPHET OF GOD SAYS GOD LOVES TO BE WORSHIPED. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH, CHURCH. LOOK, I'M GOING TO GET BACK TO THIS, BUT LOOK, CHURCH, WHEN GOD, WE KNOW THE PROPHET SAID WHEN GOD WAS, DON'T GET NERVOUS. I'M ABOUT to close. REMEMBER, HE SAID WHEN GOD WAS ALL ALONE, HE WAS JUST ETERNAL. AMEN. &gt;&gt; BUT THERE WAS SOMETHING HE WANTED TO COME OUT. OH MY. &gt;&gt; Oh my. SO HE STARTED TO CONDESCEND. WHAT WAS HE DOING? HE WAS UNVEILING HIMSELF. &gt;&gt; AND THEN HE HE WAS GOING THROUGH THE STAGES OF UNVEILING HIMSELF. BUT HALLELUJAH. HE WANTED MORE THAN JUST TO UNVEIL HIMSELF, CHURCH. HE CREATED ANGELS. WHY? TO WORSHIP HIM. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. LISTEN, I GUARANTEE YOU THERE WAS NO PIANO THERE. [snorts] &gt;&gt; Now the difference is they worshiped out of duty. &gt;&gt; Why do you worship? [laughter] &gt;&gt; Every time they came IN GOD'S PRESENCE, THEY BOWED DOWN AND THEY SAID, "HOLY, HOLY, HOLY, HOLY, HOLY, HOLY, HOLY, HOLY, HOLY, Lord God Almighty, HOLY, HOLY, HOLY." NOTHING ELSE COULD COME OUT OF THEIR MOUTH. They were created to give God that kind of worship. &gt;&gt; But then you and I, HALLELUJAH, WHO'VE GONE THROUGH SOMETHING, HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; WHO WHO WHO HAD UPS, WHO'VE HAD DOWNS. &gt;&gt; AT TIMES WHEN WE FELT LIKE WE WERE LOST, AT TIMES WHEN WE WERE FELT LIKE WE WERE ALL ALONE. OUR WORSHIP SHOULD COME FROM ANOTHER PLACE. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; NOT FROM DUTY. IT SHOULD COME FROM GRATITUDE. &gt;&gt; IT SHOULD COME FROM SOME THANKSGIVING. IT SAY ENTER INTO HIS GATES. AMEN. &gt;&gt; ENTER INTO HIS COURTS. &gt;&gt; Thanksgiving and praise. &gt;&gt; Still, I ain't mention a instrument yet. &gt;&gt; So, where is it coming from? It has to be a revelation. &gt;&gt; Think about it, church. Now you get to the place where God is just in some places he's trying to get us to understand that he requires worship. &gt;&gt; Let's go to uh Exodus chapter 15. This is just coming to me. Y'all know I'm a shotgun preacher, so just bear with me as I keep loading cuz I do believe in blasting. Hallelujah. Are you with me, church? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. See, I ain't got much that I can control. BUT ONE THING I can control is I can be a worshshiper. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHEN THE SUN IS SHINING. THAT'S WHEN IT'S SNOWING. THAT'S WHEN THE BUFORD MOSQUITOES THAT ARE THIS BIG FLYING AROUND. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. I CAN STILL BE A WORSHSHIPER. THE CONDITIONS OF THE EARTH CAN'T STOP ME FROM WORSHIPING &gt;&gt; BECAUSE IT'S A REVELATION. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. IT DON'T MATTER WHO PREACHING. IT DON'T MATTER WHO SINGING. HALLELUJAH. GOD HAS BEEN GOOD TO ME. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. SEE, CHURCH, THAT'S WHAT IT COMES DOWN TO. YOU HAVE TO ASK YOURSELF, HALLELUJAH. WHAT IS GOD TO YOU? &gt;&gt; WHO HAS HE BEEN TO YOU? &gt;&gt; WHAT WILL HE BE TO YOU? AMEN. AND THEN YOU PUT THAT IN FRONT OF YOU BEFORE YOU WORSHIP. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; But church, look in in in in Exodus uh 15 verse one, IT SAYS, "THEN SANG MOSES AND THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL uh this song unto THE LORD, AND SPAKE, SAYING, I WILL SING unto the Lord, for he hath TRIUMPHED GLORIOUSLY. THE HORSE AND HIS RIDER HAVE HE DROWNED IN THE SEA." NOW, WHO'S GOING TO TELL THEM PEOPLE NOT TO SING that song? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. THE PROPHET OF GOD SAID, "I'MMA TAKE YOU THERE." THIS IS AFTER THEY CAME THROUGH THE RED SEA. &gt;&gt; THE PROPHET OF GOD SAY, "NOW, MIRIAM GRABBED THE TAMBOURINE." &gt;&gt; But we know they only play that in black churches. [laughter] &gt;&gt; That's foolery. &gt;&gt; NOBODY HAS A PATENT ON WORSHIP. &gt;&gt; That's right. I KNOW WE WANT TO DO IT. WE WANT TO MAKE WE WANT TO MAKE WORSHIP A CULTURE. BUT IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THAT. IT'S A REVELATION. &gt;&gt; YES. SOME PEOPLE DO IT DIFFERENT. SOME PEOPLE DO IT LOUD. SOME PEOPLE DO IT QUIET. BUT THE GREATEST THING WE CAN DO IS DO IT BY REVELATION. [cheering] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. WHAT WAS HAPPENING? WHY WERE THEY SINGING THAT SONG? BECAUSE THE PROPHET OF GOD SAID THEY CAME THROUGH THE SEA. HALLELUJAH. BUT THEY CAME THROUGH ON DRY GROUND. &gt;&gt; IT WASN'T IT WASN'T A WISHY-WASHY REVELATION WHETHER GOD WAS A DELIVERER OR NOT. &gt;&gt; IT WAS SOMETHING SOLID TO THEM. &gt;&gt; SO THEY WERE WORSHIPING BASED UPON WHAT GOD HAS DONE IN THEIR LIVES. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; IT WASN'T JUST A TESTIMONY OF MOSES CHURCH. WE DON'T WORSHIP JUST BECAUSE GOD SENT US A PROPHET. WE ARE A PART OF WHAT GOD SENT. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. AND WORSHIP IS A PROGRESSIVE REVELATION CUZ GOD HAD TO TEACH OUR PROPHET HOW TO WORSHIP. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; You better read your message. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Look, like we do sometimes. Now, we going to get into the sound part of it a little bit. Hallelujah. He was in his church and HE SAID SOME PENTECOSTALS CAME to his church &gt;&gt; and they begin to worship &gt;&gt; like they normally do. &gt;&gt; Now I'm going steal something I heard from pastor. HE SAID WHEN WE GO INTO PRAYER HE SAID BEFORE WE DO ANYTHING YOU MUST FIRST COME TO NEUTRAL. &gt;&gt; AMEN. [snorts] &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. NOW, I was just in Australia with with brother Jack, brother Aaron, me, brother Larry. And look, in Florida, they don't worship THE SAME WAY JESUS CHRIST tabernacle in in Colombia. &gt;&gt; AND [snorts] IN COLOMBIA, WE DON'T WORSHIP THE SAME WAY THEY DO IN A HUSKY. &gt;&gt; AND THUS, HALLELUJAH, BETHL TABERNACLE. BUT DOES THAT mean it's not acceptable? [laughter] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. IT'S A REVELATION. &gt;&gt; IT'S NOT HOW IT LOOKS. &gt;&gt; IT'S NOT HOW IT SOUNDS. &gt;&gt; IT'S WHAT IT'S REVEALING. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. AND IN THE MOMENT WHEN MIRIAM GRABBED THE TAMBOURINE AND SHE STARTED TO DANCING, WHAT WAS IT? IT WAS REVEALING THAT GOD IS A DELIVERER. &gt;&gt; IT WASN'T ABOUT THE SOUND. IT WASN'T ABOUT THE INSTRUMENT. IT WAS ABOUT WHAT GOD HAS DONE FOR THE BELIEVER. AND THAT'S WHAT YOUR WORSHIP SHOULD DO. IT SHOULD LET ALL US KNOW. IT SHOULD EXPRESS. IT SHOULD LET ALL US KNOW WHO GOD IS TO YOU. &gt;&gt; AND MIRIAM, HALLELUJAH, START THE DANCING. AND YOU KNOW WHAT? SHE WASN'T THE ONLY ONE. &gt;&gt; Praise God. Amen. &gt;&gt; So when I found out, Brother Brad, you know, I've been called radical, but I know I ain't the only one. I didn't saw you worship. [laughter] Hallelujah. Oh my. And me and him didn't exchange some songs. So I know he got some radicalism. I'm going to make up a word radicalism in him. Hallelujah. But there are times when I might not feel like jumping. I might feel like crying. &gt;&gt; It's still an expression. &gt;&gt; See, what I want to show tonight by the grace of God is put your patent away. &gt;&gt; And come to neutral. &gt;&gt; See, when I come here, hallelujah, Y'ALL DON'T SING EXACTLY HOW JESUS CHRIST TABERNACLE SING, &gt;&gt; RIGHT? BUT IT'S THE REVELATION OF WHAT'S being sown. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I messed WITH TONY BEFORE I CAME. I SAID, "HEY, I'm I'm, you know, I'm telling I'm going to be there tonight." I said, "Hey, I need you. I just want to pour my [snorts] See, that's me when I'm saying it. &gt;&gt; I'm getting into it cuz that's just who I am." &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. IF I'M GOING TO POUR TO GOD, YOU THINK ABOUT WHEN YOU POURING YOUR BEST DRINK, ARE YOU JUST LOOKING AT IT like this? Oh boy, I don't really feel like drinking that. I'm so thirsty, but this ain't going to do too much for me, so I'm going just pour. But if it's a hot day, [snorts] it's a hot day and you know our humidity is crazy. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It's a hot day and you got a nice drink and you pouring it. You know when a child is about to eat a good meal, they start singing. I just wanna I just wanna you [laughter] SEE THAT'S ME THAT'S MY THAT'S ME EXPRESSING HALLELUJAH BECAUSE TO ME HALLELUJAH WHEN I THINK ABOUT HOW GOOD GOD HAS BEEN HELP BUT move around sometimes &gt;&gt; I CAN'T HELP BUT CLAP MY HANDS I CAN'T HELP BUT RUN AND SHOUT THAT'S JUST THE WAY GOD HAS ALLOWED ME TO EXPRESS CONCEPT. &gt;&gt; THAT DON'T mean it's the &gt;&gt; patent &gt;&gt; cuz Tony may just do this. &gt;&gt; That don't mean, you know, I'm that DON'T MEAN HE RIGHT AND I'M WRONG. You notice I didn't say that the other way around cuz most OF US THINK QUIETNESS IS GOD. AND IT IS IN SOME CASES. YES. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. YOU SAY, "WELL, HALLELUJAH. THE PROPHET TALKED ABOUT A STILL SMALL VOICE." YES, HE IS A STILL SMALL VOICE. BUT I WANT YOU TO UNDERSTAND SOMETHING. THE SAME GOD, THE SAME SCRIPTURES TALKING TO THE SAME PROPHET, HE SAID WHEN GOD BEGIN TO MOVE, THERE WAS AN EARTHQUAKE. &gt;&gt; AND SOMETIMES WORSHIP IS A THUNDER. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. SHAKE UP THE PLACE. &gt;&gt; WE JUMP, WE SHOUT, WE HAVE A GOOD TIME. THE BIBLE ALSO SAYS, HALLELUJAH, WHEN GOD BE TO MOVE, THERE WAS A FIRE. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; WORSHIP BURNING OUT THE SIN IN OUR LIVES. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. AND HE ALSO SAID, HALLELUJAH. THERE WAS A RUSHING WIND. HALLELUJAH. ALL OF THAT WAS HAPPENING &gt;&gt; BEFORE THE still small voice. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But all of it was God. &gt;&gt; Just in that moment, God wanted to express through a still small voice. &gt;&gt; Amen. So don't give me all that. I can only imagine teachers on Hallelujah. But think about it, church. There have been places where God begin to express Hallelujah. where saints saints of GOD BEGIN TO EXPRESS through worship how great God was. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I got the quote, but I I'm just for the sake of time, I'mma paraphrase. He said when THEY CAME ON THE OTHER SIDE, HALLELUJAH, of the other side OF THE SEA, HE SAID MIRIAM GRABBED THE TAMBOURINE AND SHE STARTED TO DANCING and singing. HALLELUJAH. YOU KNOW WHO ELSE WAS SINGING? MOSES. [laughter] &gt;&gt; MOSES WAS LEADING THE WORSHIP. &gt;&gt; GOD. &gt;&gt; And I think that's the part we forget sometimes. &gt;&gt; The prophet laid it out. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hey, look church. HE SAID, "WHY WERE THEY DANCING? WHY WAS MIRIAM DANCING?" HE SAID SHE LOOKED BEHIND HER AND ALL OF HER PROBLEMS WAS DROWNING IN THE SEA. &gt;&gt; EVERY SICKNESS, EVERY TRIAL, EVERY TRIBULATION, EVERY BAD THOUGHT SHE EVER HAD IN EGYPT WAS DROWNING IN THE SEA. NOW, WHO GOING TO TELL THAT WOMAN NOT TO WORSHIP? AMEN. &gt;&gt; AND EVERYBODY ELSE THAT EXPERIENCED WHAT SHE EXPERIENCED, WHO GOING TO TELL THEM TO BE QUIET? &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; IT WAS BIGGER THAN A SOUND. &gt;&gt; IT WAS FREEDOM. &gt;&gt; REAL WORSHIP, IT EXPRESSES FREEDOM. &gt;&gt; And the reason why some people can't worship is because they still bound. &gt;&gt; A lot of times we're bound in our minds to our own thoughts. It got to sound this way. I got to act this way. I got to clap with this beat. All this all this foolishness. &gt;&gt; God wants a life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Little church. The prophet said they came to his church and he said they had a washboard, a washboard AND ALL THESE DIFFERENT THINGS and they start to let it go in church. Come on. And you know, he looked at that and he said, "Turning my church into a tavern." &gt;&gt; See, he wasn't that neutral. &gt;&gt; He was listening to the sound, looking at the instruments, not realizing that these people are worshiping because God has revealed something. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; He says he was sitting there in the seat of the &gt;&gt; scornful. &gt;&gt; See, HE WASN'T AT NEUTRAL. &gt;&gt; HE SAYS, BUT THEN HE ASKED THE QUESTION. THIS IS WHAT WE NEED TO DO SOMETIMES. WE NEED TO TALK TO God and take our eyes off one another. &gt;&gt; So he SAYS TO GOD, LORD, SHOW ME WHERE IS SCRIPTURE. &gt;&gt; HE SAID, GOD TOOK HIM TO MIRIAM. &gt;&gt; ALL RIGHT. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; A WOMAN DANCING AND SHOUTING BY REVELATION. &gt;&gt; WHY? BECAUSE SHE WAS ONCE BOUND BUT NOW SHE'S SET FREE. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; SO BEFORE YOU CRITICIZE SOMETHING, HALLELUJAH, FIND OUT THAT PERSON'S STORY. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. I ALWAYS SAY, AMEN. SOMEBODY GOING TO HAVE TO HOLD MY MULE BECAUSE GOD HEALED ME FROM BRAIN CANCER AND YOU DON'T WANT ME TO SHOUT IN YOUR CHURCH, I'M SORRY. I WAS IN A HOSPITAL FOR 18 WEEKS &gt;&gt; AND GOD IN THE MOMENT OF A TWINKLE OF AN EYE TOOK IT ALL AWAY. &gt;&gt; AND YOU DON'T WANT ME TO EXPRESS THAT GOD IS A HEALER. &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHAT MY WORSHIP IS DOING. IT'S EXPRESSING THAT GOD IS A HEALER. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; THAT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH A SOUND. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. And too often we criticize something without understanding &gt;&gt; what's behind that worship. &gt;&gt; And the prophet is criticizing based upon the sound. &gt;&gt; He says, "And now God takes him to marry him." He what I love about God, God will give you what you ask for. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; He said, "Show me where scripture took him to Mariam. &gt;&gt; Then he took him to David." &gt;&gt; Oh my. And David started to worship. Why was he worshiping? Why was he dancing? &gt;&gt; And you know, critics were there watching him. &gt;&gt; Even his very own loved ones. Don't you let your family shut you down. &gt;&gt; Oh, brother Jason. Don't mind. But one thing I've observed, parents, I want you to watch your children. &gt;&gt; They doing what they see you do. YOU SAID THEY NOT INVOLVED. THEY DON'T CLAP THEIR HANDS. Next time WHEN YOU GET THAT THOUGHT, THINK ABOUT WHAT YOU DOING. &gt;&gt; Cuz I asked a young man in church one time. I said, "Hey, one of my little buddies, I said, "Man, I noticed you wasn't clapping your hands. You weren't singing. You wasn't doing nothing." He said, "Well, my mom and dad don't &gt;&gt; Oh my. The effect you have. HALLELUJAH. IN YOUR HOUSE. &gt;&gt; NOT THROUGH SOUND, THROUGH LIFE. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. LET'S GO BACK TO CAIN AND ABEL, EVERYBODY. ALL RIGHT. &gt;&gt; LOOK, WHEN IT CAME TO CAIN AND ABEL, HALLELUJAH. THEY DIDN'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT DEVIL WORSHIP. &gt;&gt; WHO WAS THE SONG LEADER IN THE HOUSE? &gt;&gt; ADAM. AND ALL ADAM KNEW WAS GOD. Let's keep in mind THE SERPENT NEVER HAD A CONVERSATION WITH ADAM. &gt;&gt; AND BY THE TIME THEY MET, GOD WAS HANDING OUT CURSES. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. SO BY THE TIME IF HE WOULD HAVE HAD A CONVERSATION WITH GOD WITH WITH ADAM, HE COULDN'T DO IT ANYMORE BECAUSE GOD TOOK THE SERPENT, MADE HIM COMPLETELY DIFFERENT, PUT HIM ON HIS BELLY, &gt;&gt; WAS NO LONGER TALKING. SO HE COULDN'T INFLUENCE ADAM'S WORSHIP. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Oh my. So then these two boys go to worship. Where did Kane get it from? &gt;&gt; It was just who he was. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And it just came out because Adam didn't teach him that. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. All Adam knew was the presence of God. &gt;&gt; All he knew WAS THE GOODNESS OF GOD. EVEN THOUGH HE FELL INTO SIN, ALL HE COULD REMEMBER WAS HOW GOOD GOD WAS, HOW GOOD GOD IS. ALL HE COULD DO WAS GIVE GOD PRAISE. &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHY WHEN YOU WORSHIP, IT HAS TO BE YOUR OWN PERSONAL REVELATION. &gt;&gt; YOU BEING IN A MESSAGE CHURCH IS NOT GOOD ENOUGH. &gt;&gt; Cuz I WANT YOU TO UNDERSTAND SOMETHING. THE DEVIL IS IN A MESSAGE CHURCH, TOO. AMEN. &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. &gt;&gt; Trying to hinder the worship. &gt;&gt; And sometimes influencing it. &gt;&gt; We singing and you sitting there like this. &gt;&gt; You're just expressing what God means to you. &gt;&gt; Oh my. But you look and you see these two boys. They started to worshiping and Cain and Abel started worshiping, you know, and Cain may have looked at Abel. He said, "Nah, that's that's just too much, brother. Digs, you doing too much. Look at you. YOU SWEATING LIKE YOU'RE SHOOTING BASKETBALL. You're just doing too much, man. We we all we need to do is play some nice soft nice soft uh uh uh uh Maverick City. Some some some Bethl worship. Something real soft and nice." And you know, YOU THINK ABOUT THAT, THAT sound good. Hallelujah. But then church, WHAT KANE CRITICIZED, GOD, WHAT HE WHAT CAIN CRITICIZED AND HE THOUGHT WASN'T WORTHY ENOUGH, WHEN GOD REJECTED HIM, GOD SAID, "HEY, IF YOU DO LIKE YOUR BROTHER, &gt;&gt; THE VERY ONE YOU MIGHT THINK IS TOO RADICAL IS THE VERY ONE GETTING GOD'S ATTENTION." &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. WHETHER IT BE CRYING, WHETHER IT BE SINGING, WHATEVER IT MAY BE. HALLELUJAH. WHATEVER YOU MAY BE CRITICIZING MAY BE THE VERY THING THAT'S PLEASING TO GOD. &gt;&gt; WHAT? BECAUSE GOD IS LOOKING FOR A LIFE. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. AND NOW HE TELLS HIM, "HEY, DO LIKE YOUR BROTHER. WORSHIP LIKE HIM AND YOU'LL BE ACCEPTED." &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. &gt;&gt; SAY, "NO, I can't do it. Can't do it." &gt;&gt; But then as God kept moving, different one start to worship. worship began to change mask. Look church, why did God set the children of Israel free? The Bible says he heard they cried. He heard, you know, their agony, their pains, and all this different stuff. But listen, hallelujah. What he told Moses to go tell Pharaoh. He said, "Hey, I've heard the cry of my people. &gt;&gt; LET MY PEOPLE GO THAT THEY MAY GO INTO THE WILDERNESS AND DO WHAT?" &gt;&gt; WORSHIP. WORSHIP. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; I'MMA SAY IT AGAIN. I GUARANTEE YOU WAS NO PIANO THERE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; IT WAS ABOUT OFFERING UP A LIFE. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; GOD SET THEM FREE SO THAT THEY COULD GO INTO THE WILDERNESS AND GIVE BACK A LIFE TO HIM. HALLELUJAH. THAT'S WHY GOD SENT THE MESSAGE TO US. SET US FREE. WHY? SO THAT WE COULD WORSHIP HIM. CUZ WE WERE DOING IT IN PART IN OUR DENOMINATIONS. BUT THEN HE CAME AND SET US FREE SO WE COULD WHOLLY worship him. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He said my people go there they may worship me. So they went in the wilderness and they started to worshiping. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But then as it went along you know different instruments got involved in different things and that's when people started to settle in. Right. &gt;&gt; Worship originally was about a life, &gt;&gt; sacrifice of life. BUT THEN AS WE STARTED ADDING SOUND TO IT, people started to take away from the life &gt;&gt; and they put people on the keyboard and different INSTRUMENTS WHOSE LIFE IS NOT WORTHY. &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHY WE DON'T SEE GOD IN THE WORSHIP. &gt;&gt; Oh my. BECAUSE IT'S SUPPOSED TO BRING out God. &gt;&gt; Oh my. AND YOU LOOK CHURCH, LISTEN WHAT GOD DID. THE BIBLE SAYS IN GENESIS 22, it said that God came to tempt Abraham. He said, "Hey, I WANT YOU TO KILL YOUR SON." LISTEN TO ABRAHAM'S LANGUAGE. ABRAHAM SAY, "I THE LAD GOING TO GO AND DO WHAT?" WORSHIP. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; We're going to go WORSHIP AND I LAG GOING TO COME BACK TO YOU. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. WHAT WAS THAT WORSHIP ALL ABOUT? THE SACRIFICE OF A LIFE &gt;&gt; HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH SOUND. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; BUT THIS WHAT ARE YOU SAYING? I'M ASKING YOU, HAVE YOU GIVEN GOD YOUR LIFE &gt;&gt; IN WORSHIP? &gt;&gt; So he goes, he gathers up everything. He has uh Isaac with him gathering stuff up. And now Isaac has to come to a place to where he surrenders in worship. &gt;&gt; There we go. That's the biggest thing right there, church. A lot of times &gt;&gt; there are things God want from us, but we ain't ready to give it. &gt;&gt; Something as simple as just raising your hands. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And we'll put it back on a sound or where we at, what church we in or whatever church. When God bless Hallelujah. It has nothing to do with these four walls. &gt;&gt; What is HE BLESSING? HE'S BLESSING THE LIFE. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. NOW THE QUESTION IS, are you blessed? &gt;&gt; About 10 of you. &gt;&gt; Oh my. So you look, he says, "HEY, YOU GO WOR. Go kill your son. I want you to GO WORSHIP." YOUR WORSHIP HAS TO BE FOR REAL &gt;&gt; CUZ YOU CAN'T FAKE GOD OUT. YOU CAN'T IMITATE SOMEBODY ELSE. IT HAS TO BE SOMETHING PERSONAL. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. IT CAN'T BE SOMETHING YOU SAW SOMEBODY ELSE DO. IT HAS TO BE A REVELATION. &gt;&gt; AND YOU HAVE TO BE WILLING TO DIE. &gt;&gt; YOU GOT TO BE WILLING TO DIE FOR WHAT'S BEEN REVEALED TO YOU. &gt;&gt; AND NOW HE HAS ISAAC LAID DOWN. AT FIRST, ISAAC HAD TO SURRENDER. THINK ABOUT OUR KIDS TODAY. SAY, "MAN, I ain't dying for you." Right. Come on. &gt;&gt; That's your revelation. [laughter] &gt;&gt; That's your revelation. I ain't dying for you. &gt;&gt; Well, look, Isaac was willing TO LAY HIS LIFE DOWN AND DO WHAT? BECOME A SACRIFICE OF PRAISE. [screaming] &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; He was GOING TO BE A SACRIFICE OF PRAISE UNTO HIS FATHER. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. SO, he laid his life down. And you know what? Hallelujah. ABRAHAM COULDN'T MIMIC WHAT HE SAW SOMEBODY ELSE DO. He literally had to go through it. &gt;&gt; He literally had to become one with the worship. &gt;&gt; And as he put his hand up to break it down, an angel came and said, "Stand out your hand. I KNOW THAT YOUR worship is for real." &gt;&gt; BECAUSE WHAT IS IT DOING? IT'S BRINGING ME BACK TO THE SAME GRACE THAT GOD GAVE WHEN HE LAID HIS LIFE DOWN. AMEN. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. YOUR WORSHIP SHOULD ALWAYS BRING US BACK TO THE EXPRESSION OF Christ &gt;&gt; again. David David starts to worship. He starts to dance and his wife is looking at him say, "Look at the king dancing out his clothes." &gt;&gt; You know what? If I was there, me and David would have been twins. Amen. &gt;&gt; Cuz I'm not just a follower. &gt;&gt; If God is revealing something, I want to be a part of it. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. AND THE REASON WHY DAVID DANCED is because he saw the ark. &gt;&gt; HE SAW THE ARK ON ITS WAY BACK. &gt;&gt; AND BY REVELATION, HE KNEW ONCE THAT ARK WAS RESTORED, THEY'D BE UNSTOPPABLE AGAIN. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. THAT THE ENEMY WOULD NEVER BE A MATCH FOR THE CAMP AGAIN. WHY? Because the word was restored. &gt;&gt; AND DAVID, HALLELUJAH, IT WASN'T, AMEN. JUST A BIG MEETING. IT WAS AN ORDINARY WEDNESDAY NIGHT SERVICE. &gt;&gt; And he SAW A WORD ON ITS WAY BACK. IT WASN'T EVEN RESTORED YET. JUST THE REVELATION OF KNOWING WHAT CAN HAPPEN ONCE IT'S PUT BACK IN PLACE. THINK ABOUT THAT, CHURCH. HALLELUJAH. WE HAVEN'T HAD A BODY CHANGE YET, BUT JUST THE POSSIBILITY OF KNOWING THAT IT'S GOING TO HAPPEN &gt;&gt; IS ENOUGH TO GET ME OUT OF MY SEAT. &gt;&gt; IS ENOUGH TO GET ME TO RAISE MY HAND. IS ENOUGH TO BRING TEARS DOWN MY EYES. JUST THE THOUGHT OF KNOWING WHAT GOD IS GOING TO do &gt;&gt; is enough for me. and David with just the thought of knowing truth being revealed right there in the worship. Hallelujah. That when the word is restored, the camp is safe again. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Church, do we believe we have a word that makes us safe? &gt;&gt; H we have a word where the enemy can't just bust in our camp. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We're free to worship. OH MY. &gt;&gt; THAT'S THE GRACE OF GOD. &gt;&gt; AND THERE SHOULD BE AN EXPRESSION TOWARDS GOD. Oh my. Everybody. All right. [snorts] &gt;&gt; Listen. He said he he's talking about Abel. He said it was a revelation that Abel had that made him just. He had a revelation of the requirements of the almighty God. AND HE BROUGHT A LAMB. HALLELUJAH. IT WAS THE REVELATION THAT HE WAS EXPRESSING BACK TO GOD THROUGH worship &gt;&gt; and THE REVELATION OF KNOWING THAT THEY'RE SAFE. DAVID BE TO dance before the Lord. See, the Bible DON'T SAY THAT HE WAS DANCING before Israel. IT SAY THAT HE WAS DANCING BEFORE the Lord. &gt;&gt; SO THE ONLY ONE, HALLELUJAH, THAT HAD TO BE PLEASED WITH THE DANCE WAS GOD. &gt;&gt; SO WHY YOU JUDGING ME OR JUDGING SOMEBODY ELSE? I AIN'T WORRIED ABOUT YOU. GOD IS THE ONLY ONE I GOT TO PLEASE. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. SO IF I RAISE MY HAND, IF I DON'T RAISE MY HAND, IF I CRY, IF I SHOUT, IF I DANCE, LONG AS GOD IS PLEASED, I'M ALL RIGHT. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; That's what counts. He said, "As David danced before the Lord, even in the midst OF HIS CRITICS, &gt;&gt; SOMEBODY CLOSE TO HIS HEART, look at the king dancing out his clothes." What a shame. What a pity. Poor brother Digs, jumping and running again like always. &gt;&gt; Yeah. My worship is the same. &gt;&gt; It ain't something I take off and put on. &gt;&gt; It's a real revelation. And what I love about David, hallelujah, even though he loved his wife, you know what he told her? He said, "Hey, you think that was something? You wait the Sunday. &gt;&gt; But we going to cut UP IN HERE TERRIBLE." HALLELUJAH. WE GOING TO REALLY SHAKE it up in here. Everybody going to be in here pouring. Hallelujah. Think about it. What happens when we all come under the same headship of the revelation of worship? &gt;&gt; What happens? Don't get nervous. I'm about to close. I said I'm about to. So, I might say that four more times. &gt;&gt; Just know that I'm about to. Y'all know I say that because those words got power. It helps bring you back into attention. Some of you looking down at the floor. I said I'm about to close. [applause] Some of you drifting. I'm about to close. Amen. Praise the Lord. That was just wonderful. Brother Diggs woke me up out of my sleep. [laughter] So, if you're a little tired, maybe a little disinterested, I ain't offended. I'm about to close. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Well, church, it's about the life being expressed back to God. &gt;&gt; AND FROM THE BEGINNING OF TIME, it was all about the life being expressed back to God through the worship. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; IT'S US THAT PUT IT ON A SOUND. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; IT'S ALWAYS THE LIFE BEHIND THE PERSON PUSHING out the sound. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Again, we go to David. Hallelujah. Remember God put a CURSE ON SAUL. &gt;&gt; WHY? BECAUSE HE WAS DISOBEDIENT. &gt;&gt; BUT THEN WHEN DAVID CAME IN HIS PRESENCE, WHAT DID DAVID DO? DAVID BROUGHT SOME WORSHIP THERE. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. AND LOOK, DAVID STARTED TO PLAY THE HARP. And he was so skillful with it. Hallelujah. And as he played THE DEMONS AROUND, HALLELUJAH. BEGIN to run because of the worship. OH, &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. OUR WORSHIP CAN DRIVE OUT DEMONS &gt;&gt; IF THE LIFE IS RIGHT. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. IT'S NOT THE SOUND. IT'S THE [screaming] LIFE BEHIND THE SOUND. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. THE SOUND IS FOR THE FLESH. &gt;&gt; BUT THE LIFE IS FOR the inward man. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. IN TERMS AS DAVID BEGAN TO WORSHIP, THAT SPIRIT WOULD LIFT UP OFF OF SAUL. DON'T YOU REALIZE &gt;&gt; normally when Saul saw David, he wanted to kill him. &gt;&gt; BUT WHILE DAVID WAS WORSHIPING, THERE WAS NOTHING HE COULD DO ABOUT IT. See the sound of closing. [laughter] &gt;&gt; I've been preaching for an hour. I'm about to close. Maybe about 55 minutes. Hallelujah. Something like that. But I try to be mindful. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But look, church, it's always about the life. Yes. &gt;&gt; And you look at David. David starts to play. And the demon, hallelujah, that was on Saul that wanted to take his life. They had him all messed up. They had him all bitter and jealous. When he came into the presence of that worship, that spirit would leave. &gt;&gt; Now, I WANT YOU TO UNDERSTAND SOMETHING. THAT SPIRIT CAME FROM GOD. &gt;&gt; BUT THE ANOINTING ON DAVID WAS SO STRONG, IT COULD DRIVE OUT A SPIRIT THAT GOD PUT THERE. &gt;&gt; WHY? BECAUSE IT WAS THE SAME LIFE. AMEN. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. WHERE WAS GOD? HE WAS IN DAVID. &gt;&gt; THE BIBLE SAID DAVID WAS WHAT? A MAN OUT OF GOD'S VERY OWN HEART. &gt;&gt; SO THE WORSHIP THAT DAVID WAS GIVING OUT WOULD HAVE BEEN THE SAME WORSHIP THAT GOD WOULD GIVE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; And as he worshiped, the spirits left. Hallelujah. But when he stopped, the spirit came back. &gt;&gt; So what was the demon afraid of? It wasn't the harp. &gt;&gt; It was the life that was in David. &gt;&gt; And think about this, church. I'm going to drop a bomb ON YOU REAL QUICK. ARE YOU READY? &gt;&gt; THINK ABOUT THIS. DAVID DIDN'T HAVE THE HOLY GHOST. &gt;&gt; BUT HE WAS SO ANOINTED, &gt;&gt; HE COULD GET IN A PLACE THAT'LL DRIVE OUT EVIL SPIRITS. AND WE ARE EMPOWERED WITH THE VERY OWN LIFE. &gt;&gt; And we sit in here and get sleepy. &gt;&gt; Let me tie the blood hound back up. Hallelujah. But church, as we go on and on and look through the scriptures, you can see that it was more or less about the life. And the life would tell you whether the worship is accepted or not. Look church, they got that Moses went up on a on a on the mountain for 40 days and 40 nights and he heard a sound. &gt;&gt; HE HEARD A SOUND DOWN THERE. THEY SAY, "OH, THEY WORSHIPING." SAY, "OH, NO, THEY CUTTING UP." THAT AIN'T the sound of worship down there. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. AND HE WENT, "WHY? WHY WASN'T THE SOUND ACCEPTED?" BECAUSE OF THE PEOPLE'S LIFE, THEIR LIFE, HALLELUJAH, WAS WAS GIVING ARMS AND WORSHIP UNTO AN IDOL GOD. AMEN. &gt;&gt; SO THE VERY SOUND SHOWED THAT IT WASN'T RIGHT. &gt;&gt; Showed that the life wasn't right. &gt;&gt; IT WAS DOING WHAT? REVEALING A TRUTH. AND THAT'S WHAT OUR WORSHIP SHOULD DO. IT SHOULD BRING US INTO A TRUTH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; Think about it. I'm going to wrap it up. As we look through the Bible, real worship. All right. If you go to second Kings, me and me and Pastor Jason was sitting in the back and I can't I can't think of the He had a very first song Tony open up with You made a way when my back was against the wall &gt;&gt; and I thought that it was over. He was singing that song. Y'all know what I was playing coming down the road? &gt;&gt; That very same song. &gt;&gt; Amen. The Bible says in Chronicles 25 that the worship is supposed to prophesy the battle. &gt;&gt; SO HALLELUJAH TONY NOT JUST BEING A SONG LEADER BUT CATCHING THE INSPIRATION OF SERVICE &gt;&gt; through worship. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. THAT GOD DID WHAT? MADE A WAY. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. [screaming] &gt;&gt; YES SIR. &gt;&gt; OH MY. THE VERY THING THAT WAS ON MY HEART CATCHING IT IN WORSHIP. SO CHURCH, IF HE CAUGHT it and it was the very thing that I was, HALLELUJAH, DEALING WITH BEFORE I CAME THROUGH THE PULL PIT, WHAT IS THE MESSAGE? THE MESSAGE IS THAT GOD MADE A WAY &gt;&gt; TONIGHT. &gt;&gt; WHEN YOU THOUGHT THAT IT WAS OVER, GOD MADE A WAY. PROPHESIED IN SONG, THE WINNING OF THE BATTLE. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. [screaming] WE NOT JUST SINGING SONGS. WE'RE STEPPING INTO THE FUTURE WITH OUR WORSHIP. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. So you think about that when you come to church. &gt;&gt; You're supposed to dictate the battle. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's why I sing songs of victory. &gt;&gt; Nobody greater. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Nobody greater than you. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. My God is greater. &gt;&gt; My God is stronger. God, you are higher than any other. Now you tell me, what is God gonna do when you giving him that kind of worship? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; YOU THINK HE GONNA SIT BACK AND SAY, "I'm not greater. &gt;&gt; I'm not stronger. &gt;&gt; I'm not healer. I'm not awesome in power. &gt;&gt; YOU START TO LIFT HIM UP LIKE THAT, IT BRINGS GOD AT ATTENTION. &gt;&gt; GOD IS SAYING, "THIS IS WHAT THEY'RE SAYING ABOUT ME." SO, I HAVE TO MEET THAT EXPECTATION. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. AMEN. &gt;&gt; BECAUSE WHAT WE'RE DOING, WE'RE CALLING OUT HIS LIFE. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; BLESSED BE THE NAME OF THE LORD. &gt;&gt; Think about that. Worship church. The next time you get to church and you start to worship, remember I ain't talking about the sound. &gt;&gt; Talking about the life. &gt;&gt; What are we giving unto God? &gt;&gt; I'mma close back with that testimony. church. You ever came to church and had a headache &gt;&gt; and then start to give God praise and a headache lifted? &gt;&gt; What is that? That's the spirit. &gt;&gt; He said, "Worship in spirit and in truth." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He said, "This is the hour that we're going to do it. We're going to worship in spirit and in truth." YEAH. WE'LL SAY ALL DAY LONG, "WE GOT TRUTH." RIGHT. &gt;&gt; But we got spirit. Lazy spirit. [laughter] Not tonight, God. I just worked 10 hours. Come on, brother D. 45 minutes. You know the prophet said 45 minutes, brother dictating the worship. &gt;&gt; Church, when I was a young guy, I was so bad. I used to set like like my phone, I used to set my watch the one time I thought the preacher ought to stop. &gt;&gt; [snorts] &gt;&gt; If you're guilty of that, let me tell you something. We preachers, we don't care. &gt;&gt; Your law can be your law can be as loud as a tutu train. &gt;&gt; We hear it and we ignore it. &gt;&gt; Keep on preaching &gt;&gt; because you can't dictate the worship. &gt;&gt; It's liberty. It's freedom. Hallelujah. Amen. And it's about God having total preeminence. We look all through the scriptures, it was about God having preeminence in the life of the believer. THAT'S REAL WORSHIP. &gt;&gt; REAL WORSHIP IS GOD HALLELUJAH BEING ON DISPLAY through the life of the believer. &gt;&gt; That's real worship. And that has nothing to do with a sound. &gt;&gt; Come, come, musicians, y'all come. But there is truth revealed in worship. Just like it was with Cain and Abel. Just like it was with Abraham. Just like it was with with with Moses them. But look, the Bible says that they sung the song OF MOSES. THEY SUNG WHAT? A NEW SONG. &gt;&gt; AND THAT'S WHAT CATCH US. YOU KNOW THAT'S A NEW SONG. OH, I don't know that song. I can't sing that. That's something new. When the BIBLE SAYS WHEN THEY GOT THE VICTORY, THEY SUNG A NEW SONG. AND THE PROPHET OF GOD SAY THE REASON WHY SOME OF US DON'T WORSHIP IS BECAUSE WE AIN'T GOT ENOUGH VICTORY IN OUR LIVES. &gt;&gt; He said he was criticizing and next thing you know his Methodist foot got the patent. &gt;&gt; He said next thing you know he was out on the floor dancing with that very girl he was criticizing. &gt;&gt; Why? Because God brought him up into the revelation. &gt;&gt; Before you criticize something, try to catch the inspiration of it. &gt;&gt; Amen. Keep in mind, I'm not saying that my expression is right and your expression is wrong. &gt;&gt; What I'm saying is no matter how we express it, it should show Christ. &gt;&gt; Think about think about the sister who only had a little bit of meal and a little bit of oil. &gt;&gt; And the prophet came down there, he said, "Bake me a cake." Now, that was a special request. But even you think about the prophet, the prophet God told him, he said, "Go down there as a woman to sustain me." And when he get DOWN THERE, SHE AIN'T GOT ENOUGH for &gt;&gt; she ain't got ENOUGH FOR HIM NOR THEM. &gt;&gt; BUT HE HAD TO TRUST GOD. H SEE, THAT'S REAL WORSHIP. &gt;&gt; REAL WORSHIP IS BEING ABLE TO TRUST GOD IN THE MIDST OF ADVERSITY. &gt;&gt; SO HE SAYS, "BAKE ME A CAKE FIRST." And she says, "ALL I GOT IS JUST ENOUGH FOR ME AND MY SON AND WE GOING to bake and I'mma die." He said, "No, BAKE ME ONE FIRST." SO, SHE WAS OBEDIENT. What was she doing? She was worshiping by revelation, &gt;&gt; baking the cake, putting it together. Hallelujah. And in her mind, she had to think, hallelujah, what's going to happen after this. But that didn't stop her from worshiping. Sometimes you got to push through. Hallelujah. Don't let your imagination run wild. Push through. Hallelujah. Bring those thoughts under suggestion. Hallelujah. In her worship, she worshiped and hallelujah. [music] She baked the cake. She gave it to him. Hallelujah. AND THE PROPHET BLESSED IT. HALLELUJAH. And from that point, she was never hungry again. &gt;&gt; Now, you think about her anytime something came up about God being a provider. &gt;&gt; I GUARANTEE YOU, SHE couldn't contain her worship. &gt;&gt; And she may not have been jumping or or OR FLYING. SHE MIGHT HAVE JUST BEEN sitting at tears coming down her eyes cuz she's thinking about the goodness of God. bring her back to the life of the lamb. That's what it's supposed to do. So you examine yourself by the way you worship. &gt;&gt; Ah the greatest mystery is receiving the Holy Ghost without sensation. &gt;&gt; Yeah. You know the problem say we can't make God some old doy grandfather. &gt;&gt; Yeah. That's probably one of the greatest mysteries. But if you finish up what he was saying, he said, "But receiving a person." [laughter] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Receiving Christ Jesus. HALLELUJAH. AND IF YOU RECEIVE A PERSON, EVERY PERSON HAS SOME KIND OF EXPRESSION. [music] &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; And if you don't have some kind of expression, that mean you dead. &gt;&gt; So be real with it. Amen. &gt;&gt; Don't worry about who's around, who's watching. Be real with it. Ask yourself, am I a worshshiper? &gt;&gt; Church don't mean nothing [music] if God is not pleased with our worship. &gt;&gt; Because that's the ONLY WAY THE FIRE IS GOING TO COME DOWN UPON THE ALTAR is if God is pleased. Hallelujah. Amen. Offering that life, [music] OFFERING THAT SACRIFICE. THERE HAD TO BE something without blemish. Hallelujah. Something that [music] DIDN'T HAVE ANY FLAWS. IT HAD TO BE SOMETHING WORTHY OF GOD COMING DOWN. Ask yourself, did you give God that tonight? DID YOU GIVE GOD SOMETHING WORTHY OF COMING DOWN [music] upon your altar? &gt;&gt; Not the next man, you. &gt;&gt; Me. &gt;&gt; Did we give God what he deserves? Let's pray. Lord, we love you tonight. We appreciate you, Lord. Lord, and we pray something was said to Lord, help your people, Lord. Not my thoughts or my ways or my actions, but Lord, you deserve the very life given given back to you, [music] Lord. Lord, and we want to be like the magi, Lord. We want to prophesy the life of Christ through worship, Lord. Lord, when they came, they gave, they saw your star and they follow it. They they say, "We've come to worship him." And when they came, they came with gifts. They came with frankincense, deity, and myrr, WHICH MEANT, HALLELUJAH, WITH GOLD. IT MEANT deity and service to die. THEIR WORSHIP PROPHESIED THE LIFE OF CHRIST. [music] And Lord, let our worship step into the realms of your next step in our lives. Lord, we don't want to just be [music] bystanders. We don't want to just be church members, but we want to be what we were created for, and that was to worship. [music] Not out of duty, but out of thankfulness. Lord, because we're the redeemed of the Lord. We got a song that the angels can't sing. &gt;&gt; Lord, continue to set us free. Set us free from our own consciousness. Set us free from our own culture, Lord. Set us free from the thoughts of imagination and let us give back to you that very liberty that you've given to us. Lord, we love you. We appreciate you. In the name of Jesus Christ, somebody say, "Amen. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Sing it together now. I'm coming [music] back to the heart [singing] of worship and it's [music] all about you. It's all [singing] about you, Jesus. I'm sorry, [music] Lord, for the thing I [singing] made it. When it's [music] all about you, it's all about you. I'm coming back. I'm coming [music] back to the heart of [singing] worship. And it's [music] all about worship him now. Raise your hands to the Lord now. I'm sorry, [music] Lord, for the thing [singing] I made it. [music] When it's all about you. It's all [music] about you, Jesus. [snorts] When the music fades [music and singing] and all is stripped away and I simply come, [singing] longing just longing just [music] to bring something, something that's of worth that will bless your heart. [music and singing] I'll bring you more than a song. [music] For a song in itself, it's not what you have required. [music] You search much deeper within. And through the way things [singing and music] appear, you're looking into my heart. [singing] Oh. Oh. I'm coming [music] back to the heart of [singing] worship. And it's [music] all about Let's make it all about him. It's all about you, Jesus. I'm [music] sorry, Lord, for the thing I [singing] made it. When it's [music] all about Yes, it is, Lord. It's all about [singing] Oh, I'm coming back to [music] the heart of worship where it's all about [singing] you. Oh, it's all [music] about Yes, it is, Lord. Oh, I'm sorry, [singing] Lord, for the thing I [music] made it. When it's all about you. [singing] Lord, it's all [music] about you. Tell him this now. King of king of endless word, no one could express how much you deserve. This is [music] true. Though I'm weak, though I'm weak and poor, [music] all I have is yours. Every single [music] breath I'll bring you more. I'll bring you [music] more than a song. [singing] For a song in itself is not [music] what you have required. [singing] Lord, you search much deeper within. [music] Oh, [singing] by the way things appear. You're looking into my heart. [singing and music] Oh, I'm coming back to the heart of [singing] worship and it's all about [music] you. Tell him that. Oh, it's all about you. I'm sorry. I'm [music and singing] sorry, Lord, for the thing I've made it. When it's [music] all about you. Oh, [singing] it's all about one more time. Now, I'm [music] coming back to the heart of [singing] worship where it's all [music] about you. It's all about [singing] you, Jesus. [music] And I'm sorry, Lord, for the thing I [singing] made it when it's all [music] about you. It's all about you. Can you sing [music] this now? It's all It's all about you. It's all about you. It's all about [singing] you. It's all about you, Jesus. [singing] Give the Lord a hand clap of praise. [applause and music] Amen. Could you come and gather? Could you come and gather quickly? We're going to gather just up here close to the altar and just pray. Take up these needs that we [music] have. Amen. Some of them that were sent in. Amen. Did you appreciate the word of the Lord? Amen. Why don't we just give the Lord Jesus a another worship of hand [music] clap of praise. Amen. He's worthy. Thank you, brother Diggs. Amen. Just wonderful. Amen. Worship is not a song. It's not music. It's a life as Brother [music] Diggs so so well. So put it so well. Amen. It's not about a style. It's not about a you know a method. Amen. It's a life. It's a life that's lived. It's a sacrifice. Amen. and it's being identified. That's what the prophet taught us that uh Abel was slain on the same altar that his lamb was slain upon. Brother Brandham said that when you apply the token, he said, "You don't come up here. You're coming for the life of Christ. You don't come up here beating [music] your buddy on the back and all laughing good old buddy." He said, "You come soberly." Amen. You're there to die. Die to yourself. Amen. That's true worship. The Bible says, "Present your bodies as a living sacrifice." Amen. Which is your reasonable service. So your reasonable service is just to give this part of you. Amen. If this if we can't give this part, how [music] how could we give our heart to the Lord? Amen. We we want to say Lord take all of me. How many want to say that? Lord take all of me. Amen. I don't want to you know [music] some people worship as brother Dicks said so well and you know express it. So we we all uh you know are made up differently. Some cry, some shout, some dance, some jump. You know, just make sure that you're being who God made you be and then you give that back to the Lord. Amen. I like how brother Dick said, there won't be no introverts in heaven. Does doesn't mean that introverts won't go to heaven. It just means that when you get there, you will no longer be an introvert. You won't be shy about giving your praise to the Lord. Amen. Praise God. We have um some prayer requests we want to look at. I think Sister Deborah just texted. I want to put this prayer request in uh for sister Deborah Jackson. I heard their whole Jackson family is not here tonight. Brother Travis texted me and said the whole family is sick. Uh so we want to keep them in prayer. Uh she just wrote in said please [music] pray for Miles as he is still not 100% yet. Also for Elijah who is not [music] feeling well either. Um some needs also that were written in from Sister Hope Quick. Please pray for Joanne's sister Carolyn Kefir, Carol Kefir. She is a believer in Three Rivers, [music] California with stage 4 pancreatic cancer. She has chosen not to have treatments and is painfully suffering when the morphine wears off. Pray that the Lord speaks to her heart and [music] answer some spiritual questions for her and that as he eases her physical suffering through this and that [music] he eases her physical suffering through this testing time, she knows that the Lord will either [music] heal her or take her. She is content with his will in the matter. Amen. We [music] just want to remember that. Carol Kefir. Amen. Believer there. So, we just have those two needs only once we're that were written in. Amen. Maybe you would have something upon your heart. You just want to raise a hand. Why don't you do that now? [music] Just hold that hand up. Identify. We're going to have Brother Digs pray for these requests. Hold that hand up. Say, "Lord, here's my need. Something I have, Amen, in my life, something I'm praying about." Prayer changes things. [music] So, that's what Wednesday night prayer meeting is about. We preach and hear the ministering of your word, but now we're [music] going to pray and talk to the Lord. Brother Diggs, would you come and take up the need for the Jackson family and also these uh hands that are raised up here? &gt;&gt; Let's pray. Lord Jesus, Father, we put you before every situation tonight, Lord. Lord, you're our healer. You're our deliverer, Lord. You're our peace. You're our comfort, Lord. And whatever the need is tonight, Lord, we know that you are more than able. And Lord, we are not going to give you thanks based upon the results. We're going to give you thanks because we know you are God. And Lord, and in asking, we know we will receive. Lord, in seeking we know we'll find, Lord, as we knock, the door shall be open, Lord. And Lord, there situations of sickness, Lord, of cancer and different themes, Lord, that have come forth through the prayer line tonight. And Lord God, we we touch and agree, Father. We get on the same accord, applying that one true life of Christ to every situation, Lord. You see the hands that are lifted.
