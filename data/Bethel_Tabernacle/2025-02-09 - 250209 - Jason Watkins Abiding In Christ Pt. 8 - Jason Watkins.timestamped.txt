[4:58] this morning. He has a lump on a thyroid
[5:01] gland, and from my
[5:05] uh testimony that he believes in prayer.
[5:07] So, we're going to pray for him that God
[5:10] will just take this
[5:11] away. How he does it, we just don't
[5:14] understand. Sometimes we don't know, but
[5:16] we just believe. You have a request upon
[5:19] your heart this
[5:20] morning. You are just this morning just
[5:23] feeling for my loved ones, my children,

[5:26] grandkids. Amen. Let's
[5:30] pray. Father, we love you this morning,
[5:32] Lord. We thank you, Father, for the
[5:34] opportunity to gather together in the
[5:36] name of Jesus Christ, to worship you in
[5:39] spirit and in truth. Present ourselves
[5:42] before you, Father. That you would
[5:44] cultivate our ground, Lord. That you
[5:46] would help us, Lord,
[5:49] to allow you to change those things in
[5:53] our lives, Lord, that are not like
[5:56] you. We pray for Brother Wayne Mosley.
[6:00] Father Lord, this
[6:02] is just a child of God coming in faith
[6:06] this morning. I come with this group of
[6:09] believers, Father, raising this up
[6:10] before you. And Lord, against this lump
[6:15] in his thyroid, Father, I lift up the
[6:18] name of Jesus Christ. You are our
[6:20] healer, Father. You are our victor and
[6:23] our banner. And that's where we look
[6:25] this evening, Lord. the requests upon
[6:28] our hearts for our loved ones and for
[6:30] whatever burdens that we have. Father,
[6:33] Lord, we present them to you in the name
[6:35] of Jesus Christ, just accepting and
[6:38] believing that you will work upon each
[6:40] request. Father, we love you this
[6:42] morning. We praise you. Bless those that
[6:44] are streaming. Open up the word of life
[6:46] to us. Lord, I pray that you would bless
[6:49] the tithes and

[26:47] Amen. God bless. We're going to invite
[26:48] you to Matthew. Thanks, sir. Matthew
[26:50] chapter
[26:51] 4. Amen. Want to just keep remembering
[26:55] um our brothers deployed today. Brother
[26:58] Matt is ministering there in uh New
[27:01] Zealand. Trav and Deb are with him and
[27:03] sister Rachel and Miles. Amen. Miles is
[27:06] becoming a jet setter already. Amen.
[27:09] Brother JD is um I think still there.
[27:12] When does he come home? Um
[27:14] girls tomorrow. Amen. Praise the Lord.
[27:17] So, uh, him and brother Alex, I've been
[27:19] looking at the keeping up with the u the
[27:22] pictures they've been posting and my
[27:24] goodness, he went to brother Enoch's
[27:26] pyramid. Amen. I was felt myself
[27:29] jealous. I've been feeling jealous for a
[27:30] long time. Ever since Mo went there when
[27:32] he was you in the army? Hey, Mo. Yeah.
[27:34] And so, um, he he was there with an
[27:37] amazing revelation to those Egyptians.
[27:40] Y'all didn't build
[27:42] this. Y'all discovered it.
[27:45] My kinfolk built this. Amen. Praise the
[27:49] Lord. God bless you. We're going to look
[27:51] right into Matthew chapter 3 this
[27:54] morning. And we're taking the eighth
[27:56] installment of our little series,
[27:57] Abiding in
[28:02] Christ. Matthew chapter 3. And then from
[28:05] here, um, Joshua will be going to Romans
[28:07] 8, but Matthew 3
[28:10] 5-7. This is John's baptism, of course.
[28:15] then went out to him Jerusalem and all
[28:19] Judea and all the region roundabout
[28:22] Jordan and were baptized of him
[28:26] um in the Jordan confessing their sins.
[28:32] But when he saw many of the Pharisees
[28:36] and Sadducees come to his
[28:38] baptism, he said unto them, "Oh
[28:42] generation of vipers, it's an
[28:44] interesting way to put
[28:46] it. Who hath warned you to flee from the
[28:50] wrath to come?" We're going to talk
[28:53] about a generation of vipers just in a
[28:54] moment. Romans chapter
[28:57] 8, we're going to get verses 28- 29. is
[29:00] all super familiar reading to us. Romans
[29:03] 28, Romans 8, 28, and
[29:07] [Music]
[29:09] 29. And we know, do we know it?
[29:14] That's very weak. All things work
[29:16] together for the good of them that love
[29:18] God. Do we know it? Amen. All things
[29:20] work together. Doesn't say all things
[29:22] will be good, right?
[29:25] just that if you are patient and you
[29:28] trust the Lord and you wait it out, God
[29:31] will force all things to work together
[29:34] for your good.
[29:37] Amen. And we know that all things work
[29:40] together. Paul says that just almost
[29:43] colloquially, almost like this is a
[29:45] given among the saints. Hey, here's
[29:47] something we all know. And and Paul had
[29:50] been through quite a bit. Yes. Amen.
[29:52] Quite a lot of suffering. Far more than
[29:54] any of us. Lot of suffering. A lot of
[29:57] rejection. And he says, "Hey, here's
[29:59] what we've learned, y'all. Y'all y'all
[30:01] feel me? We've learned that all things
[30:03] work together for us." Amen. They work
[30:06] for our good. Don't worry. God will make
[30:08] it work for our good.
[30:10] All right? And we know that all things
[30:13] work together for good to them that love
[30:16] God. Now, if you're outside of the
[30:17] covenant of Christ, then you have no
[30:19] you're not entitled to any of these
[30:20] promises. To them who are called
[30:23] according to his purpose, for whom he
[30:26] did forno, he also did predestinate to
[30:30] be conformed to the image of his son.
[30:34] So, this thing has an
[30:36] endgame. You're not just pre being the
[30:39] fact that you're predestinated in Christ
[30:41] is not just uh ear candy. There's a
[30:44] purpose behind it. Amen. He's moving to
[30:46] something. You're you're you're on a
[30:48] trail that's leading you somewhere. Stay
[30:51] on it. Stay on it. It'll get you home.
[30:55] All
[30:56] right. For whom he did forno, he also
[30:59] did
[31:00] predestinate to be conformed to the
[31:02] image of his son. That's not always
[31:05] comfortable, but that's what's up. That
[31:07] he might be. Now, catch this language. I
[31:10] said it. We're going to talk about a
[31:12] generation of vipers. And I want you to
[31:14] catch these words here. That he Jesus
[31:18] might be the
[31:20] firstborn among many brethren. Amen.
[31:26] All right. We're not talking about it's
[31:28] not sons, daughters, it's brethren. All
[31:32] right. Universal term for his whole
[31:34] family. We'll talk about it a little
[31:36] more enlarge on it as we
[31:38] go. Amen. Let's pray.
[31:42] Father, we thank you for your word and
[31:44] the inspiration that we
[31:47] feel. I commit myself into your hands,
[31:50] Lord, for perfect leadership in your
[31:52] word. We're here to receive your word.
[31:55] It is the only thing that can help us.
[31:57] It's what you sent to help us.
[32:00] It's amazing. Amazingly, Lord, almost in
[32:03] a in a in an ironic twist, it's the only
[32:07] we're we're we're reduced down to the
[32:10] only thing that can help us. You put us
[32:12] in this dark, twisted, broken world, and
[32:15] you only gave us one weapon. However, it
[32:18] happens to be the best weapon. So, we're
[32:21] going to use it today. We're going to
[32:23] absorb it. We're going to uh believe it.
[32:26] We're going to assimilate it. and we're
[32:28] going to trust and look to the Holy
[32:30] Spirit to cause it to function and work
[32:33] in our lives. Now, you'll for sure have
[32:34] to be the one to do that. That's the
[32:36] part we can't do. Our part is to say
[32:39] amen to every word. You'll have to be
[32:41] the one to bring it to pass, Lord. So,
[32:42] at the end of the day, we're still
[32:44] relying on you, Lord. I'm so glad it's
[32:48] that. I'm so glad I'm not relying on me.
[32:51] I'm so glad I'm not relying on the arm
[32:54] of flesh. I'm relying on you, Lord. You
[32:57] have pulled this off since the dawn of
[32:59] time. You've never failed. You've never
[33:01] lost one of yours. You really can't. And
[33:03] you and and all things work together for
[33:06] your purpose. So, we are just rejoicing
[33:08] in you today, Lord. The devil ain't
[33:10] nobody, Lord. He has no decision-making
[33:13] power. He's not at the table. He's not
[33:15] in the conversation. Makes no decisions
[33:18] regarding my life. All my life and times
[33:20] are in your hands. He's just an
[33:23] adversary. And I'm here to I'm here to
[33:25] stand beside my big brother and fight
[33:27] him to the finish. Lord, I'm here with
[33:30] you to see him defeated. So may it be so
[33:33] today, Lord. We commit ourselves into
[33:35] your hands to believe every word in
[33:37] Jesus name. Amen. God bless you,
[33:39] friends. You can be
[33:41] seated. Boy, are we going to
[33:43] uh have some mind benders today.
[33:48] Amen. I want you to listen intently. Try
[33:52] your best not to be distracted because
[33:55] we're we're I sometimes and not they say
[34:00] sometimes papo how about all the time.
[34:02] So sometimes when I'm around my
[34:04] grandkids and and they and I am in the
[34:07] middle of saying something and I get
[34:08] distracted or somebody cuts me off or
[34:10] interrupts me and I come back to it and
[34:11] I say, "What profound thing was Pebble
[34:14] saying?" Pebble, everything you say is
[34:16] profound. So amen. So I hope y'all love
[34:19] me as much today as my grandchildren do.
[34:21] It's going to be difficult because they
[34:22] love me quite a bit. A man would stop
[34:24] the world to help me. Amen. So, um, but
[34:27] we're looking into the word of God today
[34:29] and I want to have your undivided
[34:31] attention. Don't worry, the Super Bowl
[34:34] is hours
[34:36] away. Many
[34:38] hours. People won't even start
[34:40] tailgating for many hours. So, breathe.
[34:44] Calm down. You'll be all
[34:49] right. Amen. Praise the Lord. He's
[34:51] trying to relax you. Amen. Relax myself.
[34:54] Amen. A merry heart doeth good like a
[34:56] medicine. You believe that? Yes. Amen.
[35:02] So we are I was astonished when I when I
[35:08] was reading Matthew 3 the other morning
[35:11] early. And I've got a lot more to say
[35:14] about it than what I'm going to say
[35:16] today. I'm actually was going to read
[35:18] all the way through verses. all the way
[35:20] through verse 12. But I decided to be a
[35:22] little more concise today and stop it at
[35:24] verse 7 because here's where I want to
[35:27] concentrate today. And I want to focus
[35:29] your
[35:30] attention on a on the on the term that
[35:34] John uses to to refer to. He's labeling
[35:38] these Pharisees and Sadducees. Becomes
[35:42] very obvious that they're coming without
[35:44] sincerity. Did you know people would do
[35:45] that?
[35:47] They would come to Christ but not
[35:48] sincerely. See, they would come and and
[35:52] they would they would they would
[35:53] actually I know this is going to shock
[35:55] you, but people can can actually have a
[35:57] form of godliness and yet deny the
[36:00] power. Yeah. Deny, brother Bram said,
[36:02] deny the living realities. In other
[36:04] words, deny God the power to change your
[36:06] life. Come on. People will actually do
[36:09] that. It's astonishing. It's astonishing
[36:12] to us because we don't do that. We can't
[36:14] hardly get our mind wrapped around
[36:16] somebody that would do that. Amen. That
[36:19] that God is not obligated to you at all.
[36:22] And he he only needs to ever even reveal
[36:25] himself to you. Even something as simple
[36:27] as nature. And and that's the only thing
[36:30] he ever even needs to do to be a just
[36:33] judge. Amen. And yet he will actually,
[36:36] as David said, I look at all the heavens
[36:38] and the stars and I think about, man,
[36:40] I'm just a worm. How are you mindful of
[36:42] me? Are you kidding? And that this great
[36:45] God would come down and reveal himself
[36:48] to you and wake you up this morning and
[36:50] bring you to the house of God and give
[36:52] you his revealed word and and and you're
[36:55] going to you're going to, you know,
[36:56] you're going to decide, okay, I'll I'll
[36:58] get back to you, Lord. I'll let you know
[37:00] whether I'll apply this in my life or
[37:02] not. Wow. Come on. Say that backwards.
[37:07] It leaves it takes my breath away. Yeah.
[37:10] when when I see that happening. But yet
[37:13] the Bible was not caught off guard.
[37:16] Prophecy is never caught off guard and
[37:19] prophecy clearly talked about that the
[37:22] whole world would go into darkness and
[37:24] there would be a gross darkness on the
[37:26] people. there would be a a a light to
[37:29] shine and that would just be to uh
[37:31] certain people who were ordained to see
[37:34] it and would see it and would allow the
[37:37] light that comes to operate through
[37:40] them.
[37:42] Now it's interesting because our series
[37:44] has been showing if it has shown
[37:46] anything at all. It has shown that that
[37:49] the fact that you are a believer of the
[37:52] word is and that you have met Christ of
[37:55] Calvary and that you have been born
[37:57] again of the spirit of God and that you
[37:59] brought your heavy laden, weary self to
[38:02] him and he gave you rest. We found out
[38:05] that was not the endgame. That was the
[38:07] beginning. That now he goes on and he
[38:10] begins to go to a deeper level because
[38:12] he's going to talk about a deeper rest.
[38:14] Abide in me and I in you. Yeah. And
[38:17] we've been laboring on that a lot. So,
[38:20] we're finding out today that it's
[38:22] insufficient. And I feel sorry for you
[38:24] if you're if you arrived here and leave
[38:26] here today as just a believer that what
[38:30] God did in this day and you're not
[38:32] willing to surrender and and live in
[38:35] those spheres with God so that he can
[38:37] work through you unfettered.
[38:40] Unfettered. Amen. Say, what's in his
[38:43] way? you
[38:45] me.
[38:48] So that's why the Apostle Paul would
[38:51] say, "Let this mind be in you." He would
[38:56] say that to believers. Yeah. He's saying
[38:58] that to people who are converted.
[39:00] Why would he need to say that? God's not
[39:02] redundant. He doesn't say things without
[39:04] purpose. And he would say to people who
[39:06] are already born again of the spirit,
[39:08] you need to let the mind of Christ that
[39:09] was in Christ be in you. Well, describe
[39:12] that. Well, here's what he did. He who
[39:14] was equal to God thought it not robbery
[39:16] to be equal with God. Laid aside all of
[39:18] that and humbled himself and became a a
[39:22] a man to take on the sin of the world.
[39:24] And he's asking his family, yes, you are
[39:27] this. You have a station. You are in the
[39:29] mind of God, but I need you to be the
[39:32] expositors of my word. I need you to be
[39:34] the vessels that carry this light into
[39:36] the world. Amen.
[39:40] Let the mind which was in Christ Jesus
[39:44] be in you and other places we could go
[39:47] to this morning. I don't want to I don't
[39:49] want to I don't want to call it getting
[39:51] in the weeds. I don't want to get
[39:54] sidetracked. So, we're coming here to to
[39:59] realize that there is a a kingdom of
[40:03] saints. And I'm going to say that a
[40:04] number of times because that's really
[40:06] the crux of what's on my heart today.
[40:09] that there are that there is a kingdom
[40:11] of
[40:12] saints the establishment of which has
[40:15] been going on well prior to Genesis 1:1.
[40:19] Amen. It's been an evolution. It's been
[40:21] true evolution, not Darwinian
[40:25] evolution. The the reason they conclude
[40:28] that is because they look at God's
[40:29] evolution through a scientific reasoning
[40:31] and they come up with Darwinian
[40:33] evolution. It it doesn't check all the
[40:35] boxes which shows that it's wrong. See,
[40:38] but there is a true evolution.
[40:41] All right, we're going to look at that.
[40:45] And so I want you to observe that
[40:48] there's a great contrast
[40:50] between a a a kingdom of
[40:55] saints and a generation of vipers. It's
[40:58] interesting, and this is what stood out
[41:00] to me first when I first started looking
[41:02] at Matthew 3. I thought, my we realize
[41:06] that that sin and
[41:11] hypocrisy and
[41:13] rebellion against God's
[41:15] word were not
[41:18] new, but they had reached a point now.
[41:22] It had reached, can I say it like this?
[41:24] It had reached generational
[41:27] levels because now we're 4,000 years
[41:29] post Genesis. Yes. Amen. Post the fall,
[41:32] I should rather say.
[41:34] And now John is coming to them and he's
[41:37] saying, "You're not you're not just
[41:40] vipers. You're actually part of a
[41:42] generation." Yeah.
[41:45] Of vipers. You You had an
[41:49] origin of vipers.
[41:52] Jesus picks that up when they when
[41:54] they're And Jesus rarely ever, you know,
[41:57] went about it this way. Jesus didn't
[41:58] walk around telling people that they
[42:01] were of their father the devil unless
[42:02] they challenged him because they were
[42:05] trying to accuse him of that and he just
[42:06] simply says you know I'm here I do the
[42:09] work of my father let's see you do it
[42:12] you know everything that's written of me
[42:14] I'm doing you know and if you say and
[42:17] Jesus you know kind of in a koi way
[42:19] almost almost tongue and cheek boy it
[42:21] was really going to dehorn him and they
[42:23] said oh you do those miracles by be
[42:25] elabub he said okay cool so If if I do
[42:28] them by be elabub, who is it that your
[42:30] sons do them by? Um, remind me again,
[42:33] please. Who? Oh, I'm sorry. Your sons
[42:35] don't do any miracles. Okay.
[42:39] Okay. Thank you. Have a nice
[42:45] day. So, let me say it again. We realize
[42:49] that by the time it comes to John, sin,
[42:52] hypocrisy, and rebellion against God's
[42:54] word had reached generational
[42:57] levels. The the religious schools of the
[43:01] day uh were shocked. They were shocked.
[43:05] And they sent messengers. They sent
[43:07] people, "Go find out about this guy."
[43:09] Yeah. and and and they they they were
[43:12] shocked when this this
[43:14] unckempt wild man as the as the Bible
[43:17] describes him came preaching with no
[43:20] formal education and certainly very
[43:22] little etiquette but as brother Brandham
[43:25] talks about he but he had the word of
[43:27] the Lord
[43:29] amen he was anointed with the same
[43:31] spirit that had anointed Elijah the
[43:35] Tishbite and Elisha before him before
[43:40] John. He didn't have time to kiss the
[43:43] babies or bury the dead. But his message
[43:47] was urgent. He didn't even have much
[43:49] time. It was going to be six months and
[43:51] gone. Amen.
[43:53] He emerged suddenly from the wilderness
[43:56] to announce that the kingdom of uh the
[44:01] coming kingdom of Messiah was at hand.
[44:05] and in fact is he's among you already.
[44:11] That was his message. Yeah. Like
[44:15] every generation of humanity before him,
[44:20] that generation would oppose such an
[44:24] anointed ministry. Amen. They had
[44:27] opposed They had opposed that spirit of
[44:31] Elijah that was in John. They had
[44:33] opposed it in the days when it was
[44:36] rested upon Elijah the Tishbite. It
[44:38] didn't
[44:40] matter. It didn't matter to to them that
[44:44] that he could stop the heavens so that
[44:47] it rained not for three years.
[44:50] It didn't matter to them that he could
[44:53] call fire down out of heaven that licked
[44:55] up the offering, the wood, the water,
[44:58] the dust, the stones, everything. Amen.
[45:06] It didn't matter to the school of the
[45:09] prophets in the days of Elisha. It
[45:12] didn't matter to them that they could
[45:15] swing an axe and lose the iron axe head
[45:18] into the water. And it's gone. And
[45:20] Elisha could float it. Did you know iron
[45:23] doesn't float?
[45:26] The laws of physics say no way can iron
[45:29] float. He floated it and the Bible says
[45:33] it
[45:35] swam. Wait, what? It swam. And he said,
[45:40] "Get it." And they got it out of the
[45:42] water. It didn't matter to them. It
[45:43] didn't matter that they poisoned their
[45:47] own food. And Elisha took meal and
[45:49] pitched it in and it was it was healed.
[45:51] Hallelujah. And it fed them.
[45:56] It didn't even matter to them that after
[45:58] he was dead and gone, a dead man got
[46:00] tossed in on top of his bones and came
[46:04] to life. Amen.
[46:08] So when John comes on the scene, it
[46:11] doesn't matter to that generation that
[46:13] John could come out rough and crass and
[46:17] and yet the the Matthew 3:5 says to us
[46:21] that Jerusalem and all Judea and all the
[46:26] region round about Jordan went out to
[46:28] hear him. They came into the water and
[46:30] they were baptized and repenting,
[46:32] calling on the Lord. So, so, so we
[46:36] realized that they were coming in
[46:38] repentance and this of course made the
[46:42] theology schools quite jealous. My my
[46:45] point is that that that the fact that an
[46:48] itinerate preacher who they did not
[46:51] endorse could pull that off in such a
[46:53] short amount of time and it's it's
[46:56] Jerusalem and all Judea and all the
[46:58] other parts around the Jordan. Amen.
[47:01] Amen.
[47:04] It didn't matter to that
[47:06] generation. Just like it hadn't mattered
[47:09] about what Elijah could do or what
[47:10] Elisha could do. It hadn't mattered what
[47:12] John could pull off. It doesn't matter
[47:14] to this generation today. May I just say
[47:18] it doesn't matter to this generation
[47:19] today what happened on the Ohio River or
[47:22] what happened in the Arizona desert or
[47:24] what happened in India or what happened
[47:26] in South Africa or or the or the fact
[47:29] that tens of thousands of people were
[47:30] healed of incurable diseases. Tens of
[47:33] thousands of impossible secrets of the
[47:36] heart were known. Amen. And millions
[47:38] were led to Christ. Praise God.
[47:43] didn't
[47:45] matter. I can tell you by the Bible that
[47:49] it will not matter when Elijah comes
[47:52] with Moses to the 144,000. It won't
[47:55] matter to that last generation that when
[47:58] Elijah goes to them and Israel is born
[48:00] in a day. It won't matter that they can
[48:03] control nature and they can control
[48:05] plagues and they can speak and whatever
[48:08] they say will happen. It don't matter.
[48:10] And the Bible says that instead of
[48:12] repenting, they'll curse God.
[48:15] And the saints which are in heaven,
[48:16] they'll blasphe their the saints in
[48:18] heaven. Amen.
[48:26] These kinds of things and
[48:29] more only further an
[48:32] anger, generational
[48:35] hypocrisy,
[48:37] generational rebellion against God's
[48:39] word. John says you are a generation of
[48:43] vipers.
[48:45] But it was not so at the beginning when
[48:50] we are willing to go back far enough
[48:54] back as brother Brandham said before God
[48:57] was even God and worshiped as God when
[49:00] there was nothing but him alone with his
[49:02] thoughts and there were no angels and
[49:04] there were no stars and there were no
[49:06] planets and there was no firmament there
[49:08] was nothing he wasn't even worshiped and
[49:11] that's why brother Brandham said he
[49:12] potentially he was God he was certainly
[49:14] the the
[49:16] Elohim, the the the the all knowing one,
[49:19] the allsufficient one. He was that
[49:20] divine being. He was he's never not been
[49:23] that. But he was not worshiped. So
[49:26] according to the English definition, he
[49:28] was only potentially God, but yet he was
[49:32] everything he would ever be was in him
[49:33] at that time, but it was unmanifest. And
[49:37] so when he creates angels, he's
[49:39] satisfying something that's inside him.
[49:41] They start to worship him, and now he's
[49:43] a worshiped being. He starts building
[49:45] stars and planets and an earth. He's
[49:47] building a kingdom. He's got a vision in
[49:49] his mind. Amen.
[49:51] Nothing's going to stop it. Nothing can
[49:53] stop it. Amen. From somewhere in those
[49:56] eternities, he began this process of
[49:59] true evolution. And he would build, and
[50:02] let me say it today, he would build a
[50:04] different kind of generation,
[50:08] a process to express himself into a
[50:12] kingdom of saints and a kingdom of
[50:14] brethren. It would be multi-gender,
[50:17] multi-racial,
[50:19] uh spread across a divine bouquet of
[50:22] varying uh ethnicities among as the
[50:24] Bible says uh peoples, nations, and
[50:27] tongues.
[50:29] the common denominator among them in
[50:31] heaven. When we see that they are all
[50:34] those who are the saints in glory and we
[50:36] someday will be that part of that number
[50:39] and the common denominator among this
[50:42] generation among this kingdom is that
[50:44] they and this is an important point they
[50:47] would be one grand one grand family of
[50:52] God ruling and reigning with Christ
[50:56] through ceaseless ages. They will be a
[50:59] different kind of a generation. The
[51:01] that's the common denominator in in
[51:03] heaven. And the common denominator while
[51:06] on the earth would be that they would
[51:08] all believe the word for their day.
[51:12] Hallelujah. In their day as God moved.
[51:18] The beauty of it would be that although
[51:21] it would span 6,000
[51:24] years of human
[51:26] history, from Adam
[51:29] forward, across 6,000 years of human
[51:32] history, this
[51:34] generation of saints, of
[51:38] brethren, would be considered one single
[51:42] united generational offspring.
[51:45] Hallelujah. Amen.
[51:49] Uh Josh, I'm sorry to jump you. Give me
[51:51] Matthew
[51:53] 1:1. Matthew 1:1. It's It's interesting
[51:56] and I'm I'm I'm going to say more about
[51:58] this just in a little bit, but let me
[52:00] just put this in your mind uh as seed
[52:03] right
[52:04] now. Matthew
[52:07] 1:1 the the the genealogy of Jesus as it
[52:11] were. Because remember that it's going
[52:13] to go back in 14 generations to David in
[52:15] 14 generations, back to Abraham in 14,
[52:17] back all the way back. And and so the
[52:19] the the the the proof is that that Jesus
[52:22] wasn't going to actually have any of
[52:26] their physical fallen blood life gene
[52:29] pool in him. He would be the blood of
[52:32] God. He's going to be a prototype for a
[52:34] brand new type of person. God is going
[52:37] to from him. Jesus was a spoken word
[52:40] that blood cell in him. That's why
[52:42] brother Brown could call and said he had
[52:43] the he was neither Jew nor Gentile. He
[52:46] was God. He was had the blood of God in
[52:48] him. Now the beauty that of God's plan,
[52:52] the beauty of God's plan is because God
[52:55] brought him the way that he brought him
[52:56] into the earth. Not connected to fallen
[52:58] man, but yet connected to fallen man as
[53:01] a kinfolk, as a human. And now you with
[53:04] faith in the sacrifice of Christ are
[53:06] enjoined through the blood by faith back
[53:08] through Christ to Abraham and you're
[53:11] part of that generation.
[53:13] Amen. Oh
[53:15] my. So we are. So then so then this is
[53:19] exactly why it
[53:21] says here's what it doesn't say. The
[53:25] book of the generations.
[53:28] Amen. Of Jesus Christ the son of David.
[53:32] the son of Abraham.
[53:35] This is a single generation. Amen. And
[53:39] it doesn't matter what age they would
[53:42] come up with come up in. They would be
[53:44] part of that first generation. I am a
[53:47] first generation child. Hallelujah. I I
[53:49] when were you born? 1963. But I was in
[53:51] the mind of God way before 1963. Amen.
[53:56] Now, it's the the Bible even it even
[53:59] crosses over because you can read the
[54:01] genealogy of Mary in Luke chapter 3 who
[54:04] also now Mary's a perfect type of us and
[54:07] while she was merely an incubator again
[54:09] the same thing through faith in the Holy
[54:11] Ghost joins her and Luke takes Luke 3 to
[54:15] show that the generation of Mary was
[54:18] also part of the seedline of the kings
[54:21] that so Matthew covers uh Joseph And
[54:25] Luke covers Mary because first of all
[54:29] Mary came through the line of Nathan,
[54:32] another son of David, thus avoiding the
[54:35] curse of Jeconiah. Yeah. In Jeremiah 3.
[54:39] Because the the curse under of Jeconiah
[54:42] in in Jeremiah 3 was that you're done,
[54:44] buddy. You're offspring. That's it.
[54:45] You're not going to progress from here.
[54:48] See? And so, so I'm here to tell you
[54:50] that I don't care what kind of messed up
[54:53] way you got here. It doesn't matter what
[54:57] God had to do back in your gene pool and
[54:59] bring this to that and this to that and
[55:00] this to that. You're here. You're a
[55:02] believer. This is now. You're the
[55:04] generation.
[55:05] [Applause]
[55:06] Just like Mary that can say, "Be it unto
[55:09] me according to thy word." Amen.
[55:14] So, it didn't matter what age his family
[55:16] were going to be born into the earth or
[55:18] under what condition or how their life
[55:20] went or what Satan had done to them or
[55:23] as I said Wednesday, what they had done
[55:24] to themselves. How many know we've we've
[55:27] done it to ourselves to more times. The
[55:29] devil gets a lot of credit for things I
[55:31] did. Right.
[55:36] But the beauty of it is
[55:39] is that I come from God. I go back to
[55:42] God. I remain in the generation of Jesus
[55:46] Christ. And there's nothing that sword
[55:49] or famine or height or depth or peril.
[55:52] Nothing can separate me from the
[55:54] generation of Jesus Christ. Not even I
[55:56] can separate me from that.
[56:00] And since Christ is the anointed word
[56:02] made
[56:05] flesh, well then we were always going to
[56:08] believe the word. Yeah. Amen. Because
[56:10] I'm part of the generation of Jesus
[56:12] Christ. And Jesus Christ is his word. So
[56:16] how would I not believe all of his word?
[56:18] I'm part of that.
[56:24] See, we resisted for years.
[56:29] Some of us resisted longer than others.
[56:31] Some of us
[56:32] resisted impressively.
[56:38] I'm pretty sure God never felt the need
[56:40] to go back to the drawing board. Oh,
[56:42] that boy, that girl. I tell you, I'm
[56:44] going to have to figure something else
[56:45] out. Gabriel, you got any ideas?
[56:48] Everything I'm trying, I'm I'm I'm
[56:50] loading the gun, but I'm shooting
[56:51] blanks. Uh, well, Lord, have you thought
[56:53] of this? Trust me, the Lord's thought of
[56:55] everything. Oh my. Amen. Amen. So, this
[56:59] is the generation.
[57:01] And it didn't matter what age you come
[57:03] up with, whether it's now or or or or
[57:05] whether it's now, whether it's in Moses
[57:09] and Elijah, cuz that 144,000 are going
[57:12] to be part of the first resurrection.
[57:13] They're going to be born again, receive
[57:14] the baptism of the Holy Ghost, and
[57:16] believe the same message you believe.
[57:17] Amen.
[57:19] Doesn't matter if it's them or if it's
[57:20] now being us. It doesn't matter if it
[57:22] was in John. It doesn't matter if it was
[57:24] in Elisha. Doesn't matter if it was
[57:25] under Elijah. Doesn't matter. Go back as
[57:27] far as you want to go back all the way
[57:29] back to Cain and Abel. One of them
[57:31] believed the word of God and one of them
[57:33] would not accept the word of God. Not
[57:35] only would he not accept the word of
[57:37] God, he wouldn't even accept a
[57:39] workaround.
[57:41] He was determined to have his way. And
[57:43] by the time he gets to John, it's
[57:45] generational.
[57:50] Even God recycled it in Genesis 6 with
[57:53] Noah and comes out there in Genesis 9
[57:56] and tells Noah, you know, I'm going to
[57:57] make a covenant with you and the animals
[57:59] and all the peoples of the world that
[58:01] will be. And I mean that's that's not
[58:03] very much different than than you know
[58:06] God offering dying for the sins of the
[58:09] whole world and offering everyone a
[58:12] legitimate opportunity to save
[58:14] themselves just like he had offered the
[58:17] son of his archeneemy.
[58:19] Offered the son of his arch enemy.
[58:21] That's how much God tries to save
[58:22] people. Offer the son of his arch enemy
[58:26] a way to save himself.
[58:30] even backs up Judas to try to get him to
[58:32] think, "Hold on, son. You sure?" Now
[58:35] betrayeth thou the son of man with a
[58:37] kiss. Think Judas, no coming back from
[58:40] that? You sure that's what you want to
[58:42] do? Don't get on that day and tell me,
[58:44] "Ah, made a mistake." Yeah. Cuz I'll be
[58:48] on that throne, then I'll say, "No, you
[58:49] that was then. This is now you passed
[58:51] that." And millions and billions are
[58:54] going to hear that. Sorry, you passed. I
[58:57] think that when I read the narrative of
[58:59] Matthew 25 especially because it gives
[59:01] so much more detail than the book of
[59:03] Revelation, book of Revelation just says
[59:05] the sea gave up its dead and the dead
[59:07] both small and great stood before the
[59:09] throne and the books were open. and
[59:10] another book was open and the people
[59:11] were judged out of the books and uh but
[59:15] but Matthew 25 starts handling the
[59:18] conversations and it seems to me when I
[59:21] read in in that conversation and reading
[59:23] between the lines I I get the sense that
[59:25] they know there's no need to argue. They
[59:27] make a little bit of a defense. Hey, did
[59:29] not we do these things in your name and
[59:31] we did all these mighty works. And Jesus
[59:33] won't deny their mighty works. He'll
[59:36] just say, but it was all iniquitous.
[59:38] Yeah, you you you knew it wouldn't save
[59:41] you and and you tried and you're you're
[59:45] trying to convince me now and I get it.
[59:48] I mean, why wouldn't you do that? You
[59:49] spent your whole Christian life trying
[59:50] to convince people you were a Christian
[59:52] because of your works when you really
[59:53] weren't. Amen. So it, you know, you're
[59:56] just doing what you've always done. I
[59:57] get it. But no, uh, it was all
[59:59] iniquitous. And somehow when I read the
[1:00:01] narrative, there's like a knowing.
[1:00:03] They're like,
[1:00:06] "Yeah, yep. He's
[1:00:08] right." And when they go away to the
[1:00:12] lake of fire, that's not brother Jason.
[1:00:14] That's the scripture. Right. Amen. You
[1:00:17] read that nobody cries foul. Nobody
[1:00:20] holds up a sign. Nobody's marching.
[1:00:22] Nobody's screaming. No justice. There's
[1:00:25] a knowing.
[1:00:27] Amen.
[1:00:29] That he's right. And he had always been
[1:00:32] right.
[1:00:35] But I believe
[1:00:37] today that I am preaching to a people of
[1:00:42] another generation.
[1:00:44] You say we're we're a new generation in
[1:00:46] the sense of the day and hour that we
[1:00:48] live in. We're a new generation. There's
[1:00:50] another generation after us among among
[1:00:52] the
[1:00:53] Israelites. Uh but I so in that sense,
[1:00:56] chronologically speaking, we are a new
[1:00:58] generation. But I'm here to tell you, if
[1:01:00] you ask me what generation it is, I'm
[1:01:02] going to say the original one.
[1:01:05] Amen. God saw me here before I was here.
[1:01:09] And this is this is what I was this is
[1:01:12] why abiding in him is so
[1:01:16] important. This is why I promised you I
[1:01:18] would go back and revisit Speak to the
[1:01:21] Mountain. And I'm not going to read it
[1:01:23] all to you. I just want to hit a couple
[1:01:24] of highlighted parts because brother
[1:01:26] Brandham is there and saying, you know,
[1:01:28] I'm I'm he I'm just going to say when
[1:01:30] people say if you say to this mountain
[1:01:31] be removed and cast and see, don't doubt
[1:01:34] you'll have it. And brother Brandham
[1:01:35] says, well, I just I didn't understand
[1:01:36] how that can work cuz he's saying I'm
[1:01:38] the one, not him. And seems to me that
[1:01:39] everything has to be under the
[1:01:40] atonement. It has to be him. It can't be
[1:01:42] me. And so he says, I'll just say, well,
[1:01:44] that was on the other side of the
[1:01:46] atonement. It's the only thing I know
[1:01:47] because Jesus was still living. The
[1:01:49] atonement was not yet made. He was not
[1:01:50] wounded for our transgressions yet, nor
[1:01:52] by his stripes we were healed yet. So he
[1:01:54] just gave them the power on the other
[1:01:56] side of the atonement. Great Baptist
[1:01:58] answer. See, but but then he said, "And
[1:02:01] then all of the sudden something spoke
[1:02:04] to me and said, "What about the
[1:02:05] prophets?" Come on. Amen. How's your
[1:02:08] theory work with that? And brother Ram
[1:02:11] hadn't thought about
[1:02:12] that. And he says, "Well, I began to see
[1:02:15] then it it began to unfold to me. What
[1:02:18] do you think that taken place in the
[1:02:20] meeting? And brother Brandham, now the
[1:02:21] Holy Spirit's speaking to him. What do
[1:02:23] you think that is taking place in the
[1:02:25] meetings? When you're standing there, do
[1:02:27] you think you're the one knows those
[1:02:28] people? Do you think it's you that can
[1:02:30] predict and say those people those
[1:02:32] things? You're you're going to do a
[1:02:34] certain certain thing and a certain
[1:02:35] certain thing that has happened to you
[1:02:36] in the past and a certain thing will
[1:02:38] happen to you in the future. Do you
[1:02:39] think that's you saying it? Oh my. He
[1:02:42] says, "It means so much. It's never left
[1:02:44] me." And I thought, "Surely not, Lord.
[1:02:47] It's you. Well, then do you think it's
[1:02:49] you talking when you say to this
[1:02:52] mountain? No. He says, "No." Do you
[1:02:54] think it was the prophets talking? Have
[1:02:57] they Have not you just got through
[1:02:59] preaching on the subjects that the
[1:03:01] prophets was so anointed with the Holy
[1:03:03] Spirit that it wasn't them that done the
[1:03:05] speaking. It was the Holy Ghost in them
[1:03:07] crying out. Then whatever you say, if
[1:03:09] you're anointed, wouldn't be you saying
[1:03:12] it. It would be the Holy Spirit saying
[1:03:14] it. Amen. And he comes to a new
[1:03:17] conclusion. This is a progressive
[1:03:19] revelation for William Brandham. And I
[1:03:21] thought that's right. If the person
[1:03:23] through the atonement, now listen,
[1:03:25] listen close. If the person through the
[1:03:28] atonement sanctified by the blood of
[1:03:30] Jesus Christ can live into a sphere with
[1:03:33] God, so close that he can be wrapped so
[1:03:37] completely in God by the blood of Jesus
[1:03:40] that it wouldn't be him talking. It
[1:03:43] would be the Holy Spirit speaking these
[1:03:45] things. Amen. He says, "Now this is the
[1:03:51] beginning of your new ministry. Now ask
[1:03:54] what you will and it shall be given to
[1:03:57] you."
[1:04:01] So we're we're coming to realize that
[1:04:03] this long awaited third stage, third
[1:04:06] pull, third
[1:04:07] effect of the ministry of Elijah that
[1:04:10] was to happen would happen to the bride
[1:04:13] alone. Amen. See, it would be it would
[1:04:16] be for the church. It'd be to the bride.
[1:04:19] All right. And so, so, Brother Brandham,
[1:04:24] Brother Brandham when he when he lays
[1:04:28] out those five
[1:04:30] cases where he speaks squirrels into
[1:04:33] existence, that same thing actually
[1:04:35] happened twice. That's what speak to the
[1:04:36] mountain's all about. It's two weeks
[1:04:38] apart. And God, it took God that long to
[1:04:40] get it through his skull for brother
[1:04:42] Brandham to stop thinking like a Baptist
[1:04:44] and start believing God's word. Amen.
[1:04:48] Don't get mad at me. I'm just reading
[1:04:49] you his testimony.
[1:04:53] And he he's my goodness, you know, all
[1:04:57] all the different uh five different
[1:04:59] times. And brother Brandham, catch it
[1:05:02] now, be real careful. Brother Brandham
[1:05:05] demonstrated this five times, the power
[1:05:08] of the spoken word five times in his
[1:05:12] ministry. And he labeled it in the
[1:05:16] message, look away to Jesus. He labeled
[1:05:19] it as
[1:05:20] as not used in a big way.
[1:05:29] You you controlled nature by speaking.
[1:05:36] Not used in a big way.
[1:05:40] You resurrected a fish to life by
[1:05:43] speaking.
[1:05:45] You created life on a limb and shot it.
[1:05:50] You created life out of thin air, out of
[1:05:55] nothing. Amen. By
[1:05:58] speaking, you disappeared a tumor from
[1:06:02] existence by
[1:06:04] speaking. You awarded eternal life to a
[1:06:08] mother for her lost children. by
[1:06:11] speaking
[1:06:14] and called that not used in a big way.
[1:06:21] Oh, he says it would it would take the
[1:06:23] squeeze and the tightening of the
[1:06:26] Antichrist
[1:06:28] system. None of which would be seen in
[1:06:31] his lifetime. Yeah. Amen.
[1:06:35] Now, you only have two options. You
[1:06:37] believe in a return ministry or you
[1:06:39] believe that you are the final voice to
[1:06:42] the final age. Hallelujah.
[1:06:45] It would take the squeeze. It would take
[1:06:47] the tightening of the Antichrist system.
[1:06:50] He wouldn't see any of that in his
[1:06:51] lifetime. He would be taken off the
[1:06:53] scene. We certainly know the squeeze is
[1:06:56] now. And we Amen. And we certainly know
[1:07:00] the tightening is growing every day.
[1:07:04] Does the church believe that today?
[1:07:07] Now, it doesn't appear to me that he
[1:07:11] will be the one speaking beyond the not
[1:07:14] in a big way, right? How? So, then it
[1:07:18] begs a fair question. How will that
[1:07:21] unfold? Okay, I got a question back
[1:07:24] because that's a good question. How's
[1:07:25] that going to unfold? Here's my question
[1:07:27] to you. How do you know it's not
[1:07:28] already? Amen. Amen. We've been here 70
[1:07:33] years after these events. How do you
[1:07:36] know it's not already unfolding? But
[1:07:39] brother Jason, won't the world need to
[1:07:42] change some more for that to move? Won't
[1:07:46] it take more squeezing and more
[1:07:49] tightening for this for for this to
[1:07:52] become that? Can I say to you that that
[1:07:56] that this that is this life of the world
[1:07:59] you live in right now could become that
[1:08:03] by tomorrow morning. Oh yeah. Your this
[1:08:06] could become that by tomorrow morning.
[1:08:10] See, so we we don't claim to know we
[1:08:14] don't claim to know how all of this will
[1:08:16] play out. And we may discover that it
[1:08:20] that it that that that it's been
[1:08:22] happening in a way we weren't expecting.
[1:08:25] God hidden and revealed in simplicity.
[1:08:28] Or we may find out that it's more when
[1:08:30] it when it starts. We may find out that
[1:08:32] it's more than we're expecting as I live
[1:08:35] and breathe right now. And all of that
[1:08:37] is true. But that's not the point.
[1:08:42] That's all true. But that's not the
[1:08:45] point. The point is that when this
[1:08:49] becomes true and when it becomes real in
[1:08:52] whatever form it is happening or will
[1:08:54] happen or will continue to happen or
[1:08:56] will get worse with happening, it will
[1:08:58] be the generation of God's kingdom
[1:09:00] through the atonement sanctified by the
[1:09:03] blood of Jesus that live into a sphere
[1:09:06] with God so close that he can be wrapped
[1:09:08] so completely in God by the blood of
[1:09:10] Jesus that it won't be him talking. It
[1:09:13] won't be her talking. It won't be you
[1:09:15] talking. It will be the Holy Spirit
[1:09:18] speaking. That sounds a lot like abiding
[1:09:21] in Christ to me. That sounds like John
[1:09:25] 15:7. If you abide in me and my words
[1:09:27] abide in you, you shall ask what you
[1:09:30] will and it shall be done unto you.
[1:09:35] Amen.
[1:09:38] You good? That's got some time.
[1:09:46] I'm trying to get to my
[1:09:48] sermon. I mean that quite sincerely.
[1:09:54] This
[1:09:56] all it just seems fantastic to the
[1:09:59] world. They can't hardly they can hardly
[1:10:01] get their mind around it. They can
[1:10:03] hardly believe it.
[1:10:08] They can't understand. They can't grasp
[1:10:10] how it works or how it came to
[1:10:14] be. And I want to
[1:10:16] say that that's only because they are
[1:10:20] looking at human history since the
[1:10:22] records of Genesis forward. Yeah.
[1:10:26] But God began working on this generation
[1:10:30] way further back than that. Amen.
[1:10:34] Understanding what happened before
[1:10:37] Genesis 1:1, I would say to you today,
[1:10:40] is
[1:10:41] vital. Understanding what happened prior
[1:10:44] to Genesis
[1:10:45] 1:1, is vital to understanding who God
[1:10:49] is and the mystery that lies in the
[1:10:53] understanding of his godhead. Amen.
[1:10:57] A great clue that helps us unlock the
[1:11:01] triunity of God is actually found not in
[1:11:05] Genesis but in Hebrews 13:8. Jesus
[1:11:08] Christ is the same yesterday, today, and
[1:11:12] forever. Now, don't just think of the
[1:11:15] Nazarene, right? Don't think of the nail
[1:11:18] scarred man. Amen.
[1:11:20] The Bible, Paul tells the Colossian
[1:11:23] church, not only had John said all
[1:11:25] things were made by this one who be the
[1:11:27] word became flesh, not only were all
[1:11:29] things made by that one that was with
[1:11:31] God and was God, but Paul says all
[1:11:34] things were made by Jesus Christ in in
[1:11:37] the book of
[1:11:38] Colossians. All things were made by him.
[1:11:41] So you understand once you understand
[1:11:43] that that God and Christ that the son of
[1:11:47] God is not a second person in a in a
[1:11:50] deity godhead. He's that original God
[1:11:54] further
[1:11:55] expressed. And so it's God by
[1:11:57] expression. This is why the Bible calls
[1:11:59] him the express image. That's what the
[1:12:01] Bible calls him in in Colossum. He was
[1:12:03] the express image. He was the image of
[1:12:05] God expressed. He was God as a man.
[1:12:07] Brother Ram said it's so simple. God
[1:12:09] lived in a man called Jesus.
[1:12:11] And and that body went and that body
[1:12:13] became a sacrifice. You couldn't kill
[1:12:15] God. So God, brother Brandham says, God
[1:12:17] acted out the part of death in Christ.
[1:12:19] Now, he really died. See, but he acted
[1:12:22] out that part. This is God. I mean, how
[1:12:25] else do you imagine a deity is going to
[1:12:28] connect to humanity? The gap is too far.
[1:12:31] There had to be a somebody in the middle
[1:12:33] that could take his hand on a holy God
[1:12:36] and a sinful people and join them
[1:12:38] together and everybody be in love.
[1:12:40] Praise God. Amen.
[1:12:43] See,
[1:12:45] so it's its 13:8 is almost like a almost
[1:12:49] like a sign. It's almost like a marker
[1:12:51] indicating a trail head. You ever go
[1:12:52] hiking and you got a sign indicating
[1:12:54] where the trail head is? And that trail
[1:12:56] head goes somewhere if you stay on it.
[1:12:58] See? So it's why Christ, it's why
[1:13:01] Christ, as we read, is a single
[1:13:04] generation. It's because of an
[1:13:06] expression through his family. So, not
[1:13:10] only was Jesus part of the first
[1:13:12] generation, he's the firstborn among
[1:13:14] many brethren. So, the the whole family
[1:13:16] is part of that generation. And just
[1:13:19] because he came in the middle of the
[1:13:21] book 4,000 years in, 2,000 years prior
[1:13:24] to the end, that didn't stop what he had
[1:13:26] always been before time.
[1:13:29] He's only expressing himself further
[1:13:31] along. See,
[1:13:34] so it shows why Christ is a single
[1:13:36] generation. And it's because of an
[1:13:38] expressions the Bible and I'm going to
[1:13:40] go through this list very quickly. Uh I
[1:13:44] could have put it on the board but it
[1:13:45] would slow me down. The Bible
[1:13:48] describes that cloudy pillar that pillar
[1:13:52] of fire. Um it would you know especially
[1:13:56] as it relates to as it being in the most
[1:13:58] holy place as the calls it the shikina
[1:14:03] glory. It was a it was uh theologians
[1:14:07] and the lexical aid describe it as a
[1:14:11] radiant divine light above the mercy
[1:14:15] seek of of the ark of the covenant and
[1:14:19] that this divine light
[1:14:22] symbolized God's presence and God's
[1:14:26] holiness. You find many examples of it.
[1:14:28] God mo uh he met Moses and spoke with
[1:14:32] him from above the mercy seat in Exodus
[1:14:35] 25. Uh first Kings chapter 8 talks about
[1:14:38] how that during the dedication of
[1:14:40] Solomon's temple that a cloud filled the
[1:14:42] whole temple and chased everybody out
[1:14:44] and they couldn't even minister because
[1:14:46] it filled the whole temple. Amen. See
[1:14:49] first Kings
[1:14:50] 8. So, Leviticus 16, God had warned the
[1:14:54] people that he appears uh in a cloud
[1:14:57] above the mercy seat. In Ezekiel 10,
[1:14:59] Ezekiel describes God's glory filling
[1:15:02] the temple with his brightness. Isaiah
[1:15:05] spoke about it. His train filled the
[1:15:08] temple. Deuteronomy 4 describes this
[1:15:13] fire as a consuming fire. Amen. Your
[1:15:17] God, the Lord your God, is a consuming
[1:15:19] fire.
[1:15:20] Exodus 24, the glory of the Lord
[1:15:23] appeared as a devouring fire when it
[1:15:26] came down on the mountain. You remember
[1:15:27] when all the people backed up and were
[1:15:29] afraid and Moses said, "No, don't don't
[1:15:31] back away. He wants to talk to you. Move
[1:15:35] forward. You'll be okay. This is the
[1:15:37] this is part of the plan." No, Moses,
[1:15:39] no. No, we're not we're not holy enough.
[1:15:42] We got too I got too many uh skeletons
[1:15:44] in my closet. You just go find out what
[1:15:45] he says and come back and tell us and
[1:15:47] we'll believe what you said. And that
[1:15:48] worked for a very short time till they
[1:15:50] didn't believe Moses anymore.
[1:15:54] In Ezekiel the very first chapter, God's
[1:15:56] throne appears as sapphire with
[1:15:58] amberlike brilliance mixed with fire.
[1:16:01] Daniel 7 shows God's throne radiated
[1:16:04] fire and light. And in one place, I
[1:16:06] think it's Ezekiel talks about that his
[1:16:08] upper body, the one seated there, that
[1:16:10] his upper body looked like burning
[1:16:12] metal, like bronze that's been
[1:16:14] superheated. You ever seen uh uh um the
[1:16:18] blacksmith bring a horseshoe up and it's
[1:16:20] glowing red? Yeah. And he said his whole
[1:16:22] upper body looked like that. See Matthew
[1:16:25] 17 talks about how that on Mount
[1:16:27] Transfiguration his his face shone like
[1:16:30] the sun. Revelation chapter 1 in John's
[1:16:33] vision of Christ, he describes one that
[1:16:36] that had a face like like the brightness
[1:16:38] of the sun. It was blazing. But first
[1:16:41] Timothy describes it as a blazing
[1:16:43] unapproachable light. The shikina
[1:16:47] glory wasn't just a bright light.
[1:16:51] It was a living presence. Amen. Amen. It
[1:16:56] spoke of God's purity, God's power,
[1:16:59] God's
[1:17:00] majesty. Now, I'm going to I'm going to
[1:17:03] make a case today for you for a big
[1:17:06] finish. Y'all y'all down for a big
[1:17:08] finish? Amen.
[1:17:11] Amen. Down as Gen Z speaks. Sorry. All
[1:17:14] the young people went, "Yeah, they knew
[1:17:15] what I was talking about."
[1:17:18] So, we're we're we're good for a big
[1:17:20] finish. Amen. What if it's What if it's
[1:17:23] Is it okay if it's even in simplicity
[1:17:25] and might be feel like anticlimactic?
[1:17:27] You good with that? You say, "Don't you
[1:17:30] know?" Uh-uh. I'll get there. I'll know
[1:17:32] when I get there. Amen. Are you along
[1:17:35] for the ride? Amen.
[1:17:38] I'm turning the last corner for home.
[1:17:41] Stay with
[1:17:44] me.
[1:17:46] Imagine that all you've heard about what
[1:17:50] it is. And I just read you a whole
[1:17:52] litany of things. There's all kinds of
[1:17:56] gemstones and sardis and jasper. And
[1:17:59] Sardis is like a deep deep orange deep
[1:18:03] red and sapphire is blue and and then
[1:18:06] you have gold and and that has its
[1:18:08] yellow appearance and then you have
[1:18:09] amber and then you have all of these
[1:18:11] different then you have a greenish hue
[1:18:13] and and and and so you have all of these
[1:18:15] various things. But
[1:18:17] remember everything that you imagine
[1:18:19] when you close your eyes and you think
[1:18:21] about what appeared over the mercy seat
[1:18:22] or what led the children of Israel by
[1:18:24] day or or what was a fire by night and a
[1:18:27] cloud by day. What filled Solomon's
[1:18:29] temple? All right. I I imagine
[1:18:32] everything that you've heard about what
[1:18:33] it is, how it has appeared and
[1:18:37] disappeared, how it has shown up at the
[1:18:40] most incredible times to perform the
[1:18:43] most extraordinary things. Amen.
[1:18:47] Brother Brandham tells us in the
[1:18:48] unchangeable God 1960, he he begins to
[1:18:52] speak about people like Jacob met him in
[1:18:56] an unexpected place, at an unexpected
[1:19:00] time, in an unexpected
[1:19:03] way. I'm saying that today for your
[1:19:05] benefit. I don't know how your week has
[1:19:08] been. I don't know what may transpire
[1:19:10] before you go to bed at night or what
[1:19:11] you face tomorrow. But don't lose sight
[1:19:14] of the fact that he, this pillar of
[1:19:16] fire, this pillar of a person may meet
[1:19:19] you in an unexpected place in an
[1:19:21] unexpected time in a very unexpected
[1:19:24] way. My message to you is that whatever
[1:19:26] way it comes when, however, humble
[1:19:29] yourself.
[1:19:31] Humble yourself. Bow before that
[1:19:33] presence. Raise up your hands and say,
[1:19:35] "Lord, what would you have your servant
[1:19:37] know? I'm here to humble myself. It's
[1:19:39] written of me also in the scrolls. and I
[1:19:42] also have come to do thy will, oh Lord.
[1:19:46] Amen. Amen.
[1:19:49] Brother Brandham in 1965 says in the
[1:19:52] paradox, and I'm somewhat paraphrasing
[1:19:54] some of these statements. Brother
[1:19:56] Brandham talks about how that when
[1:19:57] dealing with a sovereign God, things
[1:19:59] sometimes can happen and be
[1:20:02] unexplainable and unreasonable. Did you
[1:20:05] get that? Now, those are his direct
[1:20:07] words. Sometimes things happen in a
[1:20:10] paradox and God moves by paradox that
[1:20:13] are unex that are
[1:20:15] unexplainable and frankly unreasonable,
[1:20:19] right? To where you wouldn't think God
[1:20:21] would do it like that until he does. And
[1:20:24] brother Brandon said that this is what
[1:20:26] he had learned that sometimes things can
[1:20:29] happen and be unexplainable and
[1:20:31] unreasonable, but yet it's the truth. He
[1:20:33] comes in the unchangeable God working in
[1:20:35] an unexpectable way. That's quite a
[1:20:37] word.
[1:20:38] Unexpectable. The unchanging God. This
[1:20:41] direct quote. The unchangeable God. This
[1:20:44] is the theme of his sermon. The
[1:20:46] unchangeable God working in an
[1:20:49] unexpectable way. Amen.
[1:20:52] Now, do you have something of an image
[1:20:56] in your mind's eye? Right. I've spent a
[1:20:59] little bit describing what it looks
[1:21:01] like, what prophets told us it looked
[1:21:03] like. We've read in our own Bible
[1:21:06] experiences. We know it met
[1:21:08] Paul. We We've seen how it works. We
[1:21:10] know that the characteristics of God
[1:21:13] whenever it's come, it's always proves
[1:21:15] to be Christ because he always acts the
[1:21:16] same way. So, let me ask you again. Do
[1:21:19] you have an image in your mind? I I'm
[1:21:21] going to I'm going to stretch you out
[1:21:22] today. I want to know, do you have an
[1:21:24] image in your mind of this pillar of
[1:21:26] fire, of this cloud, of this presence,
[1:21:29] of this being? Amen.
[1:21:35] All right.
[1:21:36] Now you got it. You got that image? Get
[1:21:40] ready to go to the next
[1:21:42] level. You good? Amen. You buckled
[1:21:47] up. I'm not I'm not saying that your
[1:21:51] image is going to be more brilliant or
[1:21:54] more colorful. I I'm not I'm not
[1:21:57] suggesting the necessity of that. I I I
[1:22:00] want you to today, if you will, is just
[1:22:03] close your eyes for me for a minute.
[1:22:05] This is like brother Brandon would say.
[1:22:07] Let's close our eyes and let's imagine
[1:22:11] for a moment. Just only gonna take a
[1:22:13] minute. I'm just giving you a little
[1:22:14] exercise. I don't know that I've ever
[1:22:15] done this. Just close your eyes for a
[1:22:17] minute because I'm about to take your
[1:22:19] image to the next
[1:22:22] level. We're going to take a little
[1:22:24] journey.
[1:22:26] But before we
[1:22:27] do, I want you to take the image in your
[1:22:31] mind's eye that you have right now based
[1:22:34] on all of the descriptions we've read,
[1:22:37] and I want you to take that image and
[1:22:39] make it larger, much
[1:22:44] larger. I'm not talking about a cloud by
[1:22:47] day or a fire by night that led the
[1:22:50] children of Israel through the
[1:22:51] wilderness. I'm not talking about a
[1:22:52] cloudy pillar that stood at the
[1:22:54] tabernacle door in Exodus 33. I'm not
[1:22:57] talking about a cloud the size of a
[1:22:59] man's hand in the days of of Elijah or
[1:23:02] or that one that filled Solomon's temple
[1:23:04] so that the priest could not even in I'm
[1:23:07] not even talking about the one that
[1:23:08] appeared in Houston, Texas in 1950. And
[1:23:11] you've seen the picture for the image in
[1:23:13] your mind's eye. I want it to be much
[1:23:16] larger. I want you to think of it as
[1:23:19] world size.
[1:23:23] Now, not a cold
[1:23:25] marble, but uh uh like a like a quazar,
[1:23:30] like a
[1:23:31] burning quazar. That's I, if I could say
[1:23:35] it this way, a light many times, as the
[1:23:38] Bible describes, many times brighter
[1:23:40] than the
[1:23:42] sun. Now, while your eyes are closed,
[1:23:44] you're you're you're growing your image.
[1:23:47] It's huge. It's world size.
[1:23:50] Brother Brandham calls it a great
[1:23:54] fountain of all eternity. That's 1957 in
[1:23:58] the message
[1:23:59] life. It's a fountain of honesty and
[1:24:02] tress in their
[1:24:04] perfection. In the Hebrews series, he
[1:24:07] calls it a great fountain of spirit
[1:24:09] which had no beginning or no end. Now
[1:24:12] we're traveling, friends. We're
[1:24:14] traveling further than anyone thought
[1:24:16] possible. We're going to the very center
[1:24:19] of deep
[1:24:20] space, further and deeper than anyone
[1:24:24] has ever imagined. Further and deeper
[1:24:26] into space than any man-made
[1:24:30] device could
[1:24:32] see. After what seems like a fathomless
[1:24:35] distance, we begin to approach this
[1:24:37] reality bending worldsiz source of
[1:24:40] light.
[1:24:42] Its scale and sheer size are so large
[1:24:47] that you actually had to come to a full
[1:24:49] stop thousands of miles out from its
[1:24:51] surface just so you could take it all
[1:24:54] in. Do you have your
[1:24:56] image? Do you have your image? Bethl
[1:24:59] Tabernacle, have you traveled there with
[1:25:01] me?
[1:25:03] Eyes are still
[1:25:05] closed. I want to I want to describe to
[1:25:07] you what I
[1:25:09] see. With all of its bands of
[1:25:12] light, you can see right into the heart
[1:25:15] of this great light of
[1:25:17] incomprehensible size and scope. As I
[1:25:21] look closer, because I'm there with you
[1:25:22] on this journey, I can see running all
[1:25:26] through it, permeating and pulsating
[1:25:29] from its very heart is an uncut and
[1:25:33] uncontaminated pure
[1:25:37] life. I can see that there is within it
[1:25:41] in this life, this pure life, there's
[1:25:44] nothing negative.
[1:25:46] There's no trace of anything
[1:25:50] harmful. This pulsating whole world is
[1:25:54] free of any stress or anxieties. It's
[1:25:58] entirely untroubled and noticeably
[1:26:02] absent of fear. It's pure. It's clean.
[1:26:07] It's unfettered. It's
[1:26:10] inexhaustible. It's a fountain of life
[1:26:12] hovering in the center of the
[1:26:14] eternities. And as if from a deep well
[1:26:18] rising forth from the center of it,
[1:26:20] billowing up and pouring out, I can see,
[1:26:22] as brother Brandham described, I can see
[1:26:25] flowing streams that pass me and go all
[1:26:28] around me of pure unfettered
[1:26:33] love. Not the, as brother Brandham says,
[1:26:36] not the cheap love that humans call
[1:26:39] love, but the very essence of the actual
[1:26:42] substance of pure love
[1:26:46] itself. I can see that this well in the
[1:26:50] heart of this great burning light is awe
[1:26:53] inspiringly deep. I suddenly
[1:26:57] realize it's an entire rolling ocean of
[1:27:01] love, mercy, and
[1:27:04] grace. There is more love and more life
[1:27:08] here than all the stars and all the
[1:27:11] galaxies you could see on a clear night.
[1:27:13] At this point, friends, we've suddenly
[1:27:16] become aware that this isn't a world or
[1:27:20] star exactly. It's not a collection of
[1:27:23] gases or fuel burning in the center of
[1:27:25] the
[1:27:26] universe. It's a
[1:27:28] being, a living
[1:27:32] being, vast,
[1:27:35] astonishing, teeming with honesty,
[1:27:38] loyalty, and tremendous power.
[1:27:42] with the dawning that it's a person.
[1:27:46] It's suddenly even more breathtaking as
[1:27:49] we realize it's not an it that we are
[1:27:52] swept away by. There are hardly words to
[1:27:55] describe him at this point. He's
[1:27:57] unequaled. He's unparalleled. At the
[1:28:00] very straining limits of our
[1:28:01] imagination,
[1:28:03] unimaginable. and all of him, everything
[1:28:07] of this great eternal being of the
[1:28:09] deepest love and purest
[1:28:13] life. Open your
[1:28:15] eyes. Are you ready for the big finish
[1:28:18] of God revealed in
[1:28:22] simplicity? He poured all of
[1:28:26] himself into a single man. Amen.
[1:28:32] And that
[1:28:33] man is the firstborn of mine and your
[1:28:38] family. Amen.
[1:28:42] That worldsiz
[1:28:43] image poured himself.
[1:28:47] If Paul is to be believed, where we read
[1:28:50] in our text in Romans 8, that great
[1:28:54] being went from eternal spirit to logos
[1:28:58] to a human man, making him the firstborn
[1:29:01] among many brothers and sisters from
[1:29:03] Genesis to
[1:29:05] now. You are, we we sing that
[1:29:09] song. You are my friend and you are my
[1:29:14] brother. Even though you are a
[1:29:20] king, I love you more than any other. So
[1:29:25] much more than anything. Isn't that
[1:29:29] beautiful? You alone are my strength, my
[1:29:34] shield. That great world size. To you
[1:29:38] alone may my spirit yield.
[1:29:43] You alone are my heart's desire and I
[1:29:49] long to worship
[1:29:55] you. Not
[1:29:58] firstborn among many
[1:30:01] sons, daughters or
[1:30:03] grandchildren, uncles, aunts,
[1:30:07] cousins. It's not that. This is not
[1:30:10] linear generation.
[1:30:12] That linear generation has caused me a
[1:30:14] lot of trouble.
[1:30:16] We are all part of this first or
[1:30:20] original or singular generation. We're
[1:30:23] all part of the generation of Jesus
[1:30:26] Christ. And the Bible says, "Who shall
[1:30:29] declare his generation? For he was cut
[1:30:32] off from among the living." And Matthew
[1:30:34] records the generation, the single
[1:30:38] singular generation of Jesus Christ.
[1:30:40] Now, we know we already know that none
[1:30:43] of those people Matthew named are
[1:30:46] physically connected to him. None of the
[1:30:48] people Luke named are physically
[1:30:50] connected to him. We all know that. But
[1:30:53] listen friends, uh I would say to you
[1:30:56] that that's all the more the reason why
[1:30:58] it would say gener not generations but
[1:31:02] generation because think with me now.
[1:31:05] God was Adam's father. Amen.
[1:31:09] One person says, "Amen." God was Adam's
[1:31:12] father.
[1:31:14] God was Abraham's father. God was
[1:31:17] Jesus's father. Amen. God is my father.
[1:31:22] It's the same father that's been working
[1:31:26] since he was that great worldsized
[1:31:28] fountain that began to roll forward. And
[1:31:31] out from him came the logos. And the
[1:31:34] logos went into a man. And the man died
[1:31:36] on Calvary, ascended up, and gave me
[1:31:38] back his life. And now I'm enjoined back
[1:31:41] through the blood, back to that father.
[1:31:44] [Applause]
[1:31:46] Thank you, Lord. If God is my father,
[1:31:49] then Abraham is my brother.
[1:31:53] If God is the father of Jesus, then
[1:31:55] Jesus is the firstborn among many
[1:31:59] brethren. Hallelujah. I'm redeemed back
[1:32:02] to the generation of Jesus Christ who
[1:32:05] made all things. Hallelujah. He made all
[1:32:10] things by his word. He redeems all
[1:32:14] things that are his by his
[1:32:18] word. He was more than a man. Amen. He
[1:32:23] was, as a prophet would call him, the
[1:32:26] God man. the glory of God living in a
[1:32:32] man. If Paul is to be believed in
[1:32:36] Colossians
[1:32:37] 1:27, do you believe Paul?
[1:32:40] To whom God would make known what is the
[1:32:44] riches of the glory of this mystery
[1:32:48] among Gentiles, which is Christ in you,
[1:32:53] the hope of glory. Hallelujah.
[1:32:56] If Paul is to be believed, when you're
[1:32:59] born again of the spirit of God, it's
[1:33:02] God in Christ in you, the hope of glory.
[1:33:06] That's a tongue twister. I wrote it that
[1:33:09] I know it slays the King's English. I
[1:33:10] want to say it again. When you are born
[1:33:13] again of the spirit of God, it's God in
[1:33:15] Christ in you, the hope of glory. Amen.
[1:33:18] It's God in Christ in you, the hope of
[1:33:20] glory. Yes. See, so this is why now as I
[1:33:25] wind up right here, now you can begin to
[1:33:28] see why this is such a burden on my
[1:33:32] heart. Brother Brandham would say in the
[1:33:35] message, "Come follow me." I I may have
[1:33:38] read some of this. I just want to read
[1:33:39] some highlighted parts.
[1:33:43] Brother Brandham says always
[1:33:45] remember except that voice that said
[1:33:49] follow
[1:33:51] me. That voice is alive in the earth
[1:33:56] tonight. Today do you believe that same
[1:33:59] voice that said let there be is alive
[1:34:01] today?
[1:34:04] He goes on just the same as every voice.
[1:34:07] And now I got to read I got to read this
[1:34:09] part clear because this is this is
[1:34:13] something just the same as every voice
[1:34:15] and every word we spoke is still alive
[1:34:18] when that voice goes out as a wave of
[1:34:21] the air. See, watch this now. I'm going
[1:34:24] to I'm going to give you something you
[1:34:25] might not have known about your your
[1:34:27] makeup. You say, "Well, I say, what
[1:34:29] makes you up?" Well, I got feet and
[1:34:31] hands and leg and a heart and lungs and
[1:34:33] liver and kidney and brain and Well, did
[1:34:36] you also know you got a transmitter here
[1:34:40] that sends out his voice? Hallelujah.
[1:34:43] You are the transmitter that sends it
[1:34:45] out. Now, it takes the station to pick
[1:34:48] it up. Jesus was the transmitter of
[1:34:51] God's word. He was the triunity of God
[1:34:55] manifest in one man. He was complete God
[1:34:58] and complete man.
[1:35:00] The trinity of God, the trinity of the
[1:35:03] attributes of God as being father, son,
[1:35:05] and holy spirit was represented in that
[1:35:07] one man, Jesus Christ. So there he was
[1:35:10] the word. That word went out from a
[1:35:14] transmitter. He said one day, verily I
[1:35:17] say unto you, if ye say to this
[1:35:19] mountain, be moved and don't doubt your
[1:35:21] heart, but believe that what you've said
[1:35:22] will come to pass, you can have what
[1:35:24] you've said. Brother Brandon says, "Now,
[1:35:26] if you can just be the station to pick
[1:35:29] that up by the control inside of you by
[1:35:32] faith, it'll move you right into the
[1:35:35] cycle of God to the new birth to be born
[1:35:38] again." And then you will always be in
[1:35:41] contact to hear that
[1:35:44] voice. Hallelujah. I wonder if your
[1:35:46] transmitter is working good today. Oh,
[1:35:50] let me tell you something, friends. No
[1:35:51] matter how you try to go around it, you
[1:35:53] might leave this building today and
[1:35:55] you've been trying to go around what
[1:35:57] I've been preaching and now for eight
[1:35:59] different installments, you're still
[1:36:01] trying to go around it. No matter how
[1:36:03] you try to go around it, abiding in him
[1:36:06] is the inescapable way to keep you in
[1:36:09] line with the generation of Jesus
[1:36:12] Christ. There's no other way to do it.
[1:36:14] You can't avoid it. You must come this
[1:36:17] way. You're to be a transmitter of the
[1:36:20] word of God.
[1:36:22] Oh, I wonder how many today would like
[1:36:24] to be a transmitter like that with all
[1:36:27] your heart. Friends, would you like to
[1:36:28] say, "Lord, make me a transmitter. Draw
[1:36:31] me into an abiding presence. Cause me to
[1:36:34] come into your presence, Lord." We're
[1:36:36] not talking about a symbolism of
[1:36:38] holiness, a song we sing about. Those
[1:36:40] those symbols represented a person.
[1:36:44] And I want to be part of that person's
[1:36:49] generation. Hallelujah.
[1:36:52] I want to
[1:36:53] live the
[1:36:55] way he wants me to live. Stand. I want
[1:37:00] to
[1:37:01] give until there's just no more to give.
[1:37:08] I want to
[1:37:10] love love till there's just no more
[1:37:15] love. For I could never ever out love
[1:37:21] the
[1:37:23] Lord. Give me a key, sister.
[1:37:27] I want to
[1:37:29] live live the
[1:37:32] way he wants
[1:37:35] me to live. Oh, I want to give. Let's
[1:37:41] lift it up now until there's just no
[1:37:47] more to give. Oh, I want to
[1:37:52] love. No love till there's just no more
[1:37:59] love. Here's the truth. I could
[1:38:03] never ever out love my
[1:38:08] mind. Oh, let's raise up those eagle
[1:38:10] wings now. I want to live all together
[1:38:15] the
[1:38:16] way he wants me.
[1:38:21] Let me hear you. I want you.
[1:38:28] Yes.
[1:38:30] Wow. Oh, I wish you could hear how
[1:38:33] beautiful you sound.
[1:38:35] That's beautiful, church.
[1:38:38] Lift it up. Lift it up. Just know. Yes,
[1:38:42] Lord. Receive this worship. Lord, I
[1:38:45] could
[1:38:46] never ever, Lord. You're deserving of
[1:38:49] it. You're worthy of this, Lord God. All
[1:38:53] together, friends, let's sing it. I want
[1:38:55] to
[1:38:56] live, live the
[1:38:59] way he wants me. Yes, Lord. Oh, I want
[1:39:06] to give.
[1:39:12] No, more to give. Oh, I want to love.
[1:39:19] No love there. Just
[1:39:24] know. Here's the bottom line. I could
[1:39:28] never ever out
[1:39:32] love the Lord. Just keep playing that
[1:39:36] for me. We'll come back to it in a
[1:39:37] second. Brother Matt got a special day
[1:39:39] today and we've got a
[1:39:41] baptism. I want to ask the brothers to
[1:39:44] come and be making ready. Sorry you guys
[1:39:46] got to move a little bit there, big dog.
[1:39:48] But we're going to we're going to
[1:39:49] baptize a young man. I got this text
[1:39:51] this morning. My goodness, such zeal,
[1:39:54] such fervor. My phone almost caught on
[1:39:57] fire. It was a beautiful text and it
[1:40:00] reminded me so much of myself when I was
[1:40:04] uh right near his age in my late 20s and
[1:40:06] had served God for many years and had
[1:40:08] been raised a believer. But I'm going to
[1:40:10] tell you, something happened to me and
[1:40:12] God began to come to my address and I I
[1:40:15] said, "I have got to go further. I've
[1:40:17] got to stand for more than I've ever
[1:40:20] stood for. And I had a brother testify
[1:40:22] to me of that early this morning. I was
[1:40:24] sitting there in my 5:30 chair. I didn't
[1:40:26] get up at 5:30. You believe it or not? I
[1:40:29] I didn't get up till almost 7:00. I
[1:40:30] couldn't believe it. I said, "Sister
[1:40:31] Debbie, what did you do?" My goodness,
[1:40:33] what was in the supper, and man, I
[1:40:35] slept. I couldn't believe I'd slept that
[1:40:36] long. It was 6:57. And I ran in there
[1:40:39] and sat down. And just as I sat down,
[1:40:40] Brother Mike Curtis text me, "Brother
[1:40:42] Jason, God has done something special in
[1:40:45] my life." And he said, "I I've I've been
[1:40:47] having dreams and I've been having this
[1:40:50] happen and God has been dealing with
[1:40:51] me." And he said, "I have recommitted
[1:40:54] myself." And he said, "I want to get
[1:40:56] rebaptized." And I said, "Buddy, we will
[1:40:59] do that today." He said, "If today can
[1:41:01] work, I'd like to do it today." He
[1:41:03] doesn't want to wait for his parents to
[1:41:04] come back. Amen. Sorry, brother Steve.
[1:41:06] Sister Emily, he loves the Lord more
[1:41:07] than you. Sorry. Amen. I'll bet they're
[1:41:12] rejoicing over that. But we want to
[1:41:15] invite our brother to prepare himself
[1:41:16] and have the brothers get ready. Amen.
[1:41:19] We're going to have the baptism. And I
[1:41:21] love I love it when God moves on his
[1:41:24] people. We're close to the end, friends.
[1:41:27] I hope God is moving fresh on you. Amen.
[1:41:30] I'll stand up here all day and rebaptize
[1:41:32] people that want to be Amen. I believe
[1:41:34] we're that close. We can't afford to
[1:41:36] play church and and and and and just be
[1:41:39] sat be satisfied with the rest that we
[1:41:42] got in the new birth. I want to go on. I
[1:41:45] want to learn of him. I want to take his
[1:41:47] yoke upon me. As I said to you last
[1:41:49] Wednesday, I want to know him and the
[1:41:53] power of his resurrection. I don't just
[1:41:55] want to know him. I know him in a new
[1:41:58] birth, but I want to know him and the
[1:41:59] power of his resurrection. Say, "Me,
[1:42:01] too. Sign me up." Hold on. Sign. Are you
[1:42:05] sure? And the fellowship of his
[1:42:07] sufferings,
[1:42:10] being made conformable unto his
[1:42:12] [Music]
[1:42:14] death. Now, how many want to know him
[1:42:17] and the power of his
[1:42:18] resurrection? I prayed that fresh this
[1:42:21] morning. I said, Lord, whatever it
[1:42:22] takes, by any means necessary, I trust
[1:42:25] your wisdom for my life. Whatever you
[1:42:27] decide, whatever you need to do, my
[1:42:30] trust in you is implicit. It's complete.
[1:42:32] It's total. I doubt nothing. My faith in
[1:42:35] God's love is
[1:42:36] perfect. Say, you you you have perfect
[1:42:39] faith. You better believe it. I have
[1:42:41] perfect faith in this. I have perfect
[1:42:43] faith in the word of this hour. I have
[1:42:45] perfect faith in the love of God. I have
[1:42:47] perfect faith in election. I have
[1:42:49] perfect faith that God keeps all of his
[1:42:51] promises. I'm already in stage of
[1:42:53] perfect faith. That ain't something I'm
[1:42:54] waiting on. Praise the Lord. I want to
[1:42:56] abide in him daily. Closer and closer
[1:43:01] still. Say, "How close?" Yeah. No, I
[1:43:04] mean, how close you want to get right.
[1:43:07] You got
[1:43:08] it. If I'd name it, then you'd put a
[1:43:11] period on it. And I don't want to put a
[1:43:13] period on it. I want to live the way he
[1:43:15] wants me to live. I want to live live
[1:43:20] the way he wants me. Amen. Take it over,
[1:43:26] my brother.
[1:43:31] until there's just no more to give. Oh,
[1:43:38] I want to
[1:43:41] love
[1:43:42] [Music]
[1:43:48] until I could
[1:43:51] never out love the Lord. Sing it again
[1:43:56] with all your heart now. I want to live.
[1:43:59] I want to live.
[1:44:02] Live the
[1:44:04] way he wants
[1:44:06] me to live. Oh, I want to
[1:44:12] hear until
[1:44:17] [Music]
[1:44:25] it
[1:44:28] [Music]
[1:44:30] just I could
[1:44:32] never
[1:44:34] ever one more time. One more time.
[1:44:40] Come
[1:44:42] [Applause]
[1:44:43] [Music]
[1:44:45] [Applause]
[1:44:49] stand. Oh, I want to
[1:44:54] give until
[1:44:59] there again.
[1:45:02] I
[1:45:02] [Music]
[1:45:05] want
[1:45:07] to just
[1:45:10] know I could never I could
[1:45:14] never
[1:45:16] ever
[1:45:17] love the
[1:45:20] Lord. Amen. Give the Lord a
[1:45:23] hand. Hallelujah.
[1:45:30] I I imagine you heard my testimony as
[1:45:33] you're going around the back. This is so
[1:45:34] similar what happened to
[1:45:37] me. And uh the only reason I didn't get
[1:45:40] baptized a third time is that I' been
[1:45:42] baptized
[1:45:44] twice. And I thought, "No, I can't do it
[1:45:47] third time." But but the dedication in
[1:45:49] my heart was real. And I had just
[1:45:52] reached a point where, yeah, I was a
[1:45:53] believer, but the Lord was calling for
[1:45:56] more.
[1:45:58] more. And I believe that God is calling
[1:46:02] all of us into a a a deeper, fuller,
[1:46:06] richer walk. I think we're going to be
[1:46:08] the
[1:46:09] ones who are
[1:46:12] uh it won't I think the ones who we're
[1:46:15] going to be the ones who use it in a not
[1:46:18] a small way. I think it not again it
[1:46:21] might shock us how it comes, but Amen. I
[1:46:24] just want to be ready. I want the Lord
[1:46:26] to know that I love him and I mean it
[1:46:31] and I am a believer of his word. I'm not
[1:46:33] perfect. I fail to stumble. But that
[1:46:35] only drives me back to my knees when I
[1:46:37] get closer to it. Remember the quote we
[1:46:39] read Wednesday about that Caleb sent to
[1:46:41] us. And um that that that's a that's a
[1:46:45] that's a secret sauce. That's the recipe
[1:46:47] for victory. See, the more we can push
[1:46:49] out of the world, the more we can take
[1:46:51] him in, the more darkness leaves, the
[1:46:53] more light comes in. That's not growing
[1:46:55] into a new birth. That's with the new
[1:46:57] birth growing in Christ. You see, and so
[1:47:00] it's like Paul said to believers, you
[1:47:03] know, let the mind which was in Christ
[1:47:05] be in
[1:47:05] you. And uh let the word of God, he
[1:47:08] said, I think to the Colossians church,
[1:47:10] let allow permit, let the word dwell in
[1:47:14] you richly. Now, I love that descriptive
[1:47:17] word because it ain't just, well, I
[1:47:18] already got the word in me. David had
[1:47:20] that. David said, I've hid it in my
[1:47:22] heart. I've tied it to my bed post. I
[1:47:24] put it between my eyes. But the thing
[1:47:26] that wearied David is he said, "Brother
[1:47:28] Anthony, he knew it should live better.
[1:47:29] He never could make it live like it
[1:47:31] should because he didn't have the Holy
[1:47:32] Ghost." We have the ability to not
[1:47:35] suffer. David's wearing something. Amen.
[1:47:39] So, it's a thrill to have you here
[1:47:40] today. Do I already know your full name?
[1:47:43] Micah. James. Maybe I knew
[1:47:46] that. Micah James
[1:47:49] Curtis. Let's pray.
[1:47:52] Father, there's little need for me to
[1:47:55] cover the correct scriptural formula for
[1:47:58] Christian for true Christian baptism.
[1:48:00] This brother's well taught and that
[1:48:02] understands it perfectly, believes it,
[1:48:04] accepts it. And Lord God, what he has
[1:48:07] what he's doing today is a public
[1:48:09] testimony and a demonstration that you
[1:48:11] mean more to him now than you've ever
[1:48:13] met before. Amen. And it's a public
[1:48:15] testimony that he is flying higher,
[1:48:19] running deeper, running faster, pressing
[1:48:21] harder. As Paul said, press, press,
[1:48:25] strain, reach, stretch, press toward the
[1:48:30] mark, that great prize that comes with
[1:48:33] the high calling of
[1:48:35] Jesus. Pray you'll grant it to him
[1:48:38] today, Lord. Reward his faith. Reward
[1:48:40] his courage to come before these people.
[1:48:42] Lord, already having a testimony of
[1:48:44] Christ, the devil battled his mind. And
[1:48:46] what are people going to think? You've
[1:48:47] already supposed to have been a
[1:48:48] Christian. And of course, he has been.
[1:48:50] This is about knowing you more as we
[1:48:53] sing that song. Oh, I want to know you
[1:48:55] more deep in my
[1:48:57] soul. Grant it, Lord God. I commit him
[1:49:00] and commit this act now into your hands.
[1:49:03] further development, Lord. Uh, Father,
[1:49:06] that this brethren may, as brother
[1:49:08] Brandham said, be one of those who can
[1:49:11] who can live up in those spheres with
[1:49:14] God, so close to God that wouldn't even
[1:49:18] be him speaking. It would be God
[1:49:20] speaking. May it be so, Lord God. He's
[1:49:23] starting a family. He's going to need
[1:49:25] the power of the word in his mouth. I
[1:49:28] pray for every father. If they don't
[1:49:30] have that, may they quickly appeal to
[1:49:32] you. Appeal to the king. Say, "Lord, I
[1:49:35] need the authority of the word in my
[1:49:36] mouth. If I'm going to guide this
[1:49:38] family, if I'm going to keep them safe
[1:49:39] from the perils of the world, I must
[1:49:41] know you in a deeper way. Lord, may you
[1:49:44] grant it, Father, today. May this be the
[1:49:47] beginning of a great revival perhaps
[1:49:49] that could sweep along all the young
[1:49:50] men, Lord God, who are ready to take the
[1:49:53] sword of the spirit and press toward the
[1:49:54] kingdom. May you grant it today in Jesus
[1:49:57] name." Amen. Now, you just sit right
[1:49:59] there now,
[1:50:01] brother. Amen. Praise the
[1:50:04] Lord. Oh, Brother Luther, somebody took
[1:50:07] good care of you
[1:50:08] today. Amen. Praise the Lord. I've
[1:50:10] baptized many of them in frigid water
[1:50:13] late at night, 20°
