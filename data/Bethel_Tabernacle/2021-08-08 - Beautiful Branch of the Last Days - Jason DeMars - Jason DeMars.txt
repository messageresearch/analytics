all [Music] [Music] and a lot of sweat a lot of busted knuckles and um a lot of hard work so i would like to say firstly to bear with us we'd like to say that bear with us as the church while the church is under construction we've taken a lot of steps the end of this week to make sure that we can have service today we're going to try to maintain that throughout there's some more construction that we're going to need to do i just like to ask we'd like to ask that you keep your children away from there's some maybe some material that has to be left out different tools and things just whatever they may find just try to be mindful of them so that they wouldn't get hurt you can just hold the music just for one moment just be mindful of them because there are there are nails possibly uh you know that we didn't get to pick up so we'd hate to see something like that or an injury occur so just try to be mindful of that not just today but wednesday when you come to service next weekend we'll do our best to do a clean up and make sure that everything's put away but there are some things you'll notice the church is under construction so some things are not like they were and so just bear with us maybe even not as clean in certain areas as what you would expect we've done cleanup we had carpet cleaners in here there's quite a bit of construction that went on and we did our best that we could to cover you've seen on the church chat the pictures we've done our best to keep things covered up and cleaned up as best we could but you may notice some things here outside in the fellowship hall and you wonder if it's out why it's out of place well because we're under construction we have new windows we've completed a lot but there's a lot more to do and a lot more that we have planned this is phase one of multi-phase uh church renovations and improvements that we've been wanting to do and this phase one includes the windows that you that you see excuse me i'm probably clogged up from cutting all that concrete and the dust from that saw um but this is you'll see the new windows um we're gonna you'll see the windows are have a have a gap there they've been furred out because we're gonna come starting monday and start installing the hardy plank sighting around the entire church and also the landscaping has been completely removed but don't worry it'll go back we'll get new landscaping right now it's going to look sort of barren we have new doors and windows let me just read from some of these notes that i wrote they're going to help significantly these windows will help significantly with the power bill you'll notice the building was even today a lot cooler because the windows help with that the windows we had previous had no r value at all they were literally just plexi class someone had uh went and cut but we're thankful amen for that today i'd like to say thank you to all the brothers we had quite a crew brothers come here and help and if i miss anybody i apologize some helped in in small ways which we needed some helped in very large ways we had brother caleb buckman come out here for a day and my son ethan throughout the project brother mark carter came and helped with some of the finishings around the trim they're not finished i know he's probably dying for me to say this that's just i asked him to do something temporary you know what the mark said that's not that's not a sign of my craftsmanship i promise um i told him we just wanted to do something temporary so it's very temporary it's cut up and you'll see there's it didn't even cover in some places that wasn't our intention to finish it because of the interior renovations it would would not have made sense to spend money on that so it's very temporary just so that we didn't before that was there was raw wood and it just wouldn't have looked right to have service brother john lennochek came and repaired a water line that we hit while we were removing some of the landscaping and he was real crucial there that we had a crew of sisters come here a bunch of them uh come here and help to clean up get this church ready so that you can enjoy it today i just want to say thank you amen to all those who sisters who came sister rosalina who came and cleaned the fellowship paul so that you could enjoy it today and we had just ones we had others who helped in really significant amounts our brother brad yance who's here today who headed up the whole project i want to give him a hand clap a made of appreciation amen the brains uh behind the whole project and so um we might have been the bronze but he was definitely the brains behind it all and gave gave of himself and so the windows and the doors we've also replaced the doors you'll see new doors exterior in the fellowship hall and uh that entry door is getting replaced we just had we ordered it it's a special order item a brand new entry door with transoms above it like it has now the the windows here have been changed you'll notice also the office windows have been changed also the fellowship hall windows have been changed and so all the windows and all the doors were changed out we had a good solid core crew here myself brother jd who's preaching today brother charles brother aaron simmons um and and bella luther jordan came up brother luther also uh came and that that was the team who did most of all the window work and i tell you what it was a lot of work uh cutting that concrete just um you know to get the longer windows and the length to get light in here like we wanted was a lot of work it was a labor quite a labor we're thankful we got it completed um brother aaron drove hours to come multiple days to give of himself and to help out he was a he was a tremendous tremendous help use all that strength amen we put it to good work um and so uh also brother travis who came helped get some of the material you see out here and help with some of the install of the window my wife rachel was worked tirelessly the entire time with clean up carrying out cinder blocks and just anything with cleanup around the grounds to keep things under control also brother caleb campbell and brother don gurgle did a fantastic job with the landscaping not the landscaping but with the grading this was a uh looked like a a war had taken place after we got done removing all the limbs all the bushes and they worked uh man brother don does uh i don't know if he's here there he is did a fine job he should open a landscaping business um they did really i mean that it was it was surprising to all of us brothers who watched uh how meticulous and how good he did him and caleb just grated it looks good believe me what you see now is a massive difference to what it was and they worked really hard to do that so we're grateful for them if i missed any names there i apologize i think there was maybe a few others who came so we'd just like to say thank you i know that you did it out of the goodness of your heart to do something for the lord and i believe that we are blessed because of it can we give a handclap to all those who helped amen [Applause] and also the trim you'll notice here i already mentioned this the trim around the windows is temporary you'll notice some temporary things because we have some more ideas uh later you'll notice there's no dead bolts in these door handles someone asks they will there will be dead bolts we just have to drill those um the two doors we got here didn't have them so there's some things we still need to do you'll notice some trim in the fellowship pawn in the back has not been completed we will get that completed also you'll obviously as we said you'll notice the landscaping has been removed what would because we're adding new hardy plank siding to the entire building and fellowship hall we we're leaving the landscaping as it is obviously it wouldn't make sense to do that now so we're going to do the hardy plank that will start monday morning we'll start shooting the 2x4 treated lumber to the outside of the building you have to have something to nail to to nail the hardy board too so brother brad will be starting that project with a team whoever is available i know it's a work week and i know let me just say i know many more desired to help and be here and it wouldn't be for a lack of desire but because we know this is during the week and people are busy and have businesses and jobs so we understand completely if anyone gets any free time we're working usually a lot of evenings we'll post it we'll work till seven or eight o'clock so if you have time and you want to come over and give a hand uh also if i didn't mention brother charles i thought that i did someone texted me if i didn't mention brother charles brother charles thank you so much uh he was here the entire entire time and passed after we left every single night and uh my goodness i've never brother charles um when i get your age and you're not old but when i get your age i want to be able to work like you work um he just gave of himself and worked really hard he was a key a real key component to what we what we did here uh we're doing hardy plank as i said if i miss anything i'm trying to eliminate some questions and i know i want to eliminate them all the front doors getting replaced as part of this phase there will be new landscaping there will be new hardy siding that will be painted um i believe that's all of phase one fellowship poll uh also gets hardy all the way around for the new windows we have some some desires and some plans for the interior of the church and the fellowship paul but first the church a lot of really um i think plans that would be a great blessing and good improvement the churches um probably could you know some of the uh you know different wood trim and different things we've been appreciative of but we want to uh you know as maybe some of the things some people would think is a little dated so we want to update uh some things i believe update our pastor preached last sunday i think it was on change and how things got to progress and go forward so we want to remove the paneling i'll give you some of these things here we want to remove the paneling that's on the side and drywall as you see in the back and nursery and also back behind me we want to dry all of that this above you above this ceiling is some really serious lumber and that's what i've been told by carpenters who've got in the attic they they did not go cheap when they put the ceiling joists in place and they're about every six or eight feet uh it's real nice big timber bolted together really really nice timber we're wanting to remove this entire ceiling that you see and expose those trusses and make a more vaulted look to the ceiling to take the ceiling fans the lighting that right now obstruct camera views that we're wanting to change with the church camera setup so we're wanting to remove all of that take that up above remove what you see here and expose those trusses we're wanting to install a new heated and cooling system that would cool this place a lot better to we're wanting to spray foam the the attic area the ceiling to also add insulation to help this building run more efficient we're going to be replacing the carpet with new commercial more industrial carpet something that would hold up a little better both on the stage and here those are the majors i could say some of the majors that we're wanting to do to change some things that we think would be a great improvement all of those things that i just mentioned here this morning the church has done the church out of the general fund has paid for and financed all of everything you see and everything you're gonna see on phase one we won't do that with phase two or phase three which would be fellowship hall additions and remove and um renovations so we're wanting to and i got the pastoral authority to announce this here today um or else i wouldn't be doing it but we wanted to announce uh obviously my mom and dad are away in louisiana their brother tim pruitt's with the memorial service there for sister karen today but we wanted to go ahead and announce we're going to have a building fund that you can give towards because all of the improvements that we're wanting to do on the church is going to be several thousand i can tell you we're over 20 000 just on the outside phase it's probably going to be that or more with the interior so we need to start a building fund and allow you to give and to fund that with your donations and so that'll that'll be effective today if you want to give towards that you could earmark any offering or anything you want to give towards the building fund and when we reach our budget amount which more details to come on that then we'll commence we'll start the work so we won't start phase two interior until that building fund budget is funded by the church and so we ask you to give we wanted to do some of these renovations on the outside to show you what's possible that we could make the building and the premises really nice but we're going to need it takes money to do that we're going to need that so we're going to have more just a lot more to say on that i just wanted to preliminarily say there is a building fund you could earmark funds today and going forward for the building fund that will go directly into a fund that will uh go to fund the budget and like i said when we reach that amount we'll start some of the interior and we're going to give more details on what we're going to do with the interior so that you're you're in the know amen you love the lord amen let's all stand to our feet magnify the lord with me amen we just want to continue to remember that church there in louisiana and brother tim pruitt whole family whole church amen lost sister karen and so we can imagine the grief and sorrow that they're going through we just want to be mindful of them and just pray for them i've been praying for them and i believe that as a body of believers we join together one with another interlocked arms amen and their sorrow is our sorrow and that's part of being a body so we want to send prayers amen and just ask the lord to comfort them are you ready for the word this morning to come with a hungry heart raise those hands up say lord i've got a need i want to hear from you may you use your servant lord to come down right down my avenue and speak what i have need of i sought the lord and he answered me and delivered and delivered me [Music] from everything those who look those who look on him [Music] magnify the lord with me [Music] comics together glorify the lord with me come exalt his name glory [Applause] [Music] [Music] it will

and we confess to be a needy people we need your mercy we need your grace we need your strength lord we just want to lay aside our own thoughts our own thinking our own ways lord things perhaps that are influenced by the spirit of this age and the influence that the world and media and things has upon us lord we want to come under the influence of the holy spirit lord and we know that when we do that we have to come under the authority and in submission to the word of god lord so we're not looking to to man we're not looking to men we're not looking to women as our final authority we're looking to the scriptures and our desire lord is to live for you not just come to church and hear a good sermon but every day their lives would be a a song of praise as as that song goes may may our life song sing to you lord what good does it do to come to church and sing sing a song and listen to a sermon and yet what about the souls all around us what about our children what about our families what about those people were around in the workplace are we going to be something different something beautiful let our lives be that reality lord let our lives be jesus to this world lord we don't want any of ourselves we've tried that it doesn't work we know it doesn't work it doesn't satisfy we want you lord we ask that you'd come and deal with us and further us to this end lord we want to lift up the prayer requests that i received regarding brother jim babb oh lord i i so appreciate him and his faith lord and he's he's not doing well right now he needs a touch and a miracle from you lord we ask that you would deliver him lord completely totally lord that even today he would raise up and walk out of that hospital hospital a well man lord and we just ask for comfort for the family of the pruitt's lord just touch them and help them in what they're going through father we thank you for your goodness and mercy and grace we ask in jesus precious name amen well i have you standing we're going to go right to the scripture there it is and isaiah chapter 4 verse one and two beautiful branch of the last days is my topic and we're pulling that up right now brother matt amen and in that day seven women shall take hold of one man saying we will eat our own bread and wear our own apparel only let us be called by thy name to take away our reproach in that day shall the branch of the lord be beautiful and glorious and the fruit of the earth shall be excellent and comely for them that are escaped of israel may the lord add the blessing to the reading of his word he can be seated just want to welcome some of our visitors i see a few faces that i don't recognize i know brother tony mentioned to me that they had a guest sister dana and her children welcome appreciate having you and i know there's a few others brother brad sorry you're not a guest anymore you're one of us amen so i'm going to continue on this topic that i spoke about last week the beautiful branch of the lord so we see in verse 1 there in isaiah it says in that day seven women will take hold of one man saying we'll eat our own bread we'll wear our own apparel only give us your name to take away our reproach and and if you remember i spoke um on that wednesday night and i for some reason began to hit against feminism and the spirit of feminism that's on the world today right and so you see this these women they just want to be called by the man's name but they want to do their own thing they want to provide their own means they want to wear whatever they want to wear without consideration of god's program god's purpose for women god has a purpose for women god has a purpose for man he has a pro he has a program there's something called biblical manhood and biblical womanhood and guess what it's different guess what men and women are different i know it's blowing your mind men are not the same as women women are not the same as men now there was some questions nothing negative but just some clarifications on as i was talking about feminism last week and maybe some of the younger people what in the world is feminism what's that all about i want to talk about that a little bit i want to clarify that i also want to clarify when i'm saying i'm attacking feminism immediately you know what if a worldly person is listening in here or on the internet you can understand a little bit about what i'm saying and what i'm not saying so my attack against feminism is attacking the idea that we're blurring the lines between the roles of men and women my attack is against the belief that the husband is not the head of the wife my attack is against the belief that women are exactly the same as men in every way if they are i will just wonder why uh lebron james doesn't have a woman on his team their bodies are different our bodies are different our strength is different lots of things a man thinks differently than a woman all of these god made us different getting ahead of myself a little bit but he made us to complement one another we are when god made man in his image and likeness he made them male and female together male and female complete the image of god there's two aspects to that different roles made differently for different purposes and god sets forth in his word what that will be you and i don't have to have a right to redefine it we ha what we do is we try to live our lives not we try to we do there's no not trying we live our lives in submission to the word of god in the hour that we live in also my attack against feminism is because of the sexualization of women and the sexual revolution i'm against it i'm attacking it now what i'm not doing i'm not advocating sexual harassment i'm not advocating treating a woman like an object i'm so a thousand percent against that i'm not advocating blaming rape or sexual assault on women that's not right oh she dressed in such in such a way yes she has a responsibility but the man has done it and he's guilty and he needs to be treated he needs to be put to death i'm not i'm not playing this blame game on the woman i'm also not advocating a view that says women are not equal to men women are equal to men i'm also not advocating a view that says women are not as valuable as men i don't i don't believe that i don't agree with that the scripture doesn't teach that it teaches that men and women are equal and that they have different roles and they have different purposes in expressing the image and likeness of god and when a woman finds her role role and place and is fulfilling it according to the word of god it is a beautiful thing and when a man finds his position and place in the word of god and is living it it's a beautiful thing both you can find scripture that's saying putting the blame on women and that's true why because eve was the first one that sinned that's a fact you can't change that it's a fact but adam has the responsibility in it too why it doesn't it says when adam sinned we all sinned right it doesn't say when you've sinned we all sinned it says when adam sinned we all sinned he had the responsibility to lead his home and to take care of his home and the fact is the reality is he did not do that his wife was deceived and stepped out it was his duty to protect because god made him first amen alright so brother branham in recognizing your day and its message says you know the bible said that those who escape out of this great great damnation will be a beautiful branch before the lord someday i'll get to it lord willing for it for you women let you see what god thinks of the woman that really escapes this damnation of this day said she would be beautiful amen amen and you know the natural always types of spiritual the condition of the woman in the world reveals the condition of the church world the condition of a woman the women in a local church reveal the spiritual condition of the church right it because what does it do it's revealing the leadership it's revealing the leadership of the local church it's really revealing the leadership of the men or lack thereof in the local church and so the all these things that we're talking about here um there's a there's a reflection there's a there's a there's back and forth a woman is is going to reflect her on her husband husband's character is going to reflect on his wife the leadership is back and forth if a man leads correctly his his wife will enjoy the leadership that he provides she'll appreciate it because it'll make her feel safe and fulfilled but if he leads incorrectly she'll want to rebel against it and say i don't like this i don't like the whole concept of man leading no you just don't like what your husband is doing you don't like how your husband's behaving and probably you're right so what what am i talking about there is a beautiful branch of the lord in the last day and there's sisters that are an expression of that sisters in part that are a part of that there's a body it's made up of men and women there's gifts in that body because every person that's in that body is filled with the holy ghost right and so men and women are equal co-heirs of the grace of life they're they're they're both heirs a woman is not a heir through the man she's directly an heir of god just like the man is all right she has the holy ghost she can have gifts of the spirit as well in her life just as he can a she's not scripturally there's no such thing as a deaconess or a bishop s or a pastor s there's not a position of leadership in the local church for a woman that's just scripture i suffer not a woman to teach or use usurp authority over a man over a man she's not in that position and when you look at the leadership position that paul is saying ordained deacons ordained elders it's always a man that's ordained to do that right it's not it's never spoken of as a woman she's not ordained to be in a leadership position in the local church neither is she ordained to be the leader of a home of a family she's a leader of the family she's a manager of the home but she's not the leader the head of the woman is the man again who is the head of the church christ is the head of the church he is a what a man he's a male the the bride is not the head of herself the pastor is not the head of the church now you have a woman in charge of the women that's not how it works christ is the head of the church his word is what flows down to us through the ministry but yet that ministry is what the bride the bride it's it's female and so in this day we have what a bride the bride is supposed to come into what maturity she's supposed to grow she's supposed to have come to a place where she is without spot or wrinkle all right ephesians 4 11 through 14 and he gave some apostles and some prophets and some evangelists some pastors and teachers for the perfecting of the saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of christ till we all come in the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the son of god okay so this is god's purpose in the in the last days he said he would have a beautiful branch he would have a beautiful branch in the last days he would have a woman a bride for christ that would come to this place unto a perfect man and to the measure of the stature of the fullness of christ that we henceforth be no more children tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of doctrine by the slight of men and cunning craftiness whereby they lie in wait to deceive but speaking the truth and love may grow up into him in all things which is the head even christ from whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted by that which every joint supplyeth according to the effectual working in the measure of every part make it makes increase of the body unto the edifying of itself in love so you see that he he restored the word of god to us in this day the truth of the gospel in this day to do what to bring us to a place of maturity to bring us to the place where we have the measure of the stature of the fullness of christ that's existing in that beautiful branch amen ephesians 5 25-27 husbands love your wives even as christ also loved the church and gave himself for it that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word that he might present it to himself a glorious church not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing but that it should be holy and without blemish so again on one side you have seven women taking hold of one man say give us your name so we don't have a reproach upon us but let us eat our own food and wear wear our own clothes what is it there's a spirit of feminism on the land but there's also a spirit of christ in a bride and she's without spot or wrinkle she's clean holy virtuous she's set apart she's a ver she's the very expression of christ to this world she's not tossed about she's not going from one place to another place she knows who her husband is and she's faithful to him she's chased she's totally dedicated to him she doesn't need to dress sexy to attract fools and she's drunk with the blood of the martyrs and she's committed fornication with the kings of the earth the other one she's totally separated to her husband she's wearing white she's wearing linen clean and white a humble garment but a garment that's expressing what's on the inside amen a purity and same thing for sisters you're to express what you wear on the outside should express the purity that you have on the inside amen first peter 3 7. likewise your husbands dwell with them according to knowledge so what knowledge am i supposed to dwell with them with you see that dwell with them according to knowledge what knowledge giving honor to the wife okay so we're to give honor to our wives why as unto the weaker vessel uh oh it's not politically correct youtube and facebook are shutting us down the weaker of the woman is the weaker vessel what does that mean she's dumber than men she has less artistic ability than men well it used to be a viewpoint it used to be thing that people thought it's not it's not true in fact uh the younger girls are smarter than the boys that their age everybody everybody's aware of that but let's put it this way there's an intruder that comes in the house in the middle of the night who's the one that should get up honey you're better with a pistol than me why don't you why don't you guys why don't you go ahead and see what's going on there i'm going to hide out in in this closet over here you big god designed you man to be a protector of a woman not a defeater and a destroyer of women he gave you strength to protect to guard for safe keeping it made the woman the weaker vessel because she's a type of the bride and christ are we stronger than christ not one of us not one of us is so he made the man to be stronger to as a protection of the woman so so peter is saying dwell with your wives according to knowledge what knowledge she's a weaker vessel one she's a weaker vessel this should cause holy ghost men to wake up and say oh she's weaker than me i'm i'm i'm here to protect and care and nurture and cherish this woman who is weaker than me okay so that's number one that's the no first p piece of knowledge that we have to no have second piece is okay now don't get so big-headed guy that you're the stronger vessel next thing he says you are heirs together that means joint heirs of the grace of life this is a startling revelation in that hour why because women were always considered in the spiritual aspect of things to be through their husband everything was through their husband even a lot of times in in jewish faith basic knowledge was confined there was knowledge that was only for women and outside of that they didn't need to know anything right peter is setting dynamite to that idea idea you are joint heirs of the grace of life her connection in christ there's neither male nor female now he's not saying that's galatians 3 28. there's neither male nor female bond or free jew or gentile the fact is the person is a jew the fact is the person's a gentile the fact is the person's a male the fact is the person's a female the fact is the person's a slave the fact is the person is an owner that's a fact but he's what is he saying in christ there's not accep there's not different layers of access to to the gospel to salvation it's free to men directly to men directly to women and it even says in peter says you can without the word by your behavior win your unbelieving husband to salvation all right so we're joint heirs together so he's saying this glory of god that you have in this vessel you man being the stronger her being the weaker yet inside that vessel is a glory is the holy ghost you equally possess this holy ghost and so have this knowledge when you live with your wife have this knowledge when how you treat her how you act towards her understand you're a protector you're a nurturer you're a cherisher this is what that's scripture it says no man hated his own body but nourishes and cherishes as does christ the church so as husbands we do the same we're to nourish and cherish our wives and we're to be the protector of them understanding that they're equal to us in christ let that sink in message brothers she's not a doormat she's not less than you she's not less valuable than you you're not a you're not above her in god's program god's pro what did jesus do when he was raised from the dead he didn't have peter james and john his inner his inner inner circle meet him did he he had a woman what was he trying to say he says to me a woman's testimony is just as valuable as a man's testimony in the middle east today today a woman's testimony is worth either a half or a fourth of what a man's testimony is you have to get four women to witness a crime in order for that person to be convicted but one man could witness it no problem all right proverbs 31 10 through 15. who can find a virtuous woman for her price is far above rubies the heart of her husband does safely trust in her so that he shall have no need of spoil she will do him good and not evil all the days of her life she seeks wool the picture that i'm getting here of this woman is a picture of the person that's entrusted with 10 10 talents remember the parable he's given ten talents instead of the person with one just buries the talent comes back with one this woman is given ten talents and she multiplies them that's the picture that i'm seeing she will do him good and not evil all the days of her life she seeks wool and flax and works willingly with her hands she is like the merchant ships she brings her food from afar okay what does that mean she seeks wool flax works willingly with her hands she she she imports she she imports but she also exports that's what it's saying whenever she wants to import something she has something of equal value that she's exporting in other words she's a person of wisdom when her family has a need she sees those needs are there and she's already done something to provide for and take care of that need now understand proverbs 31 what are we looking at you know how how do we how do we relate this to our society today right i think a few screens ahead i'm going to skip yeah just to give a picture cultures change right but the word of god never changes and so god doesn't say well back in the bible times women had this role but now the time has changed so forget that nonsense no it doesn't say that we as believers by the holy ghost in our current culture that we have today have to walk in obedience to the principles that god sets forward and be sure that we're not under the influence of worldly demonic spirits the things i'm going to talk about today i have no person in this room in mind what i have in mind is the spirit of this age the spirit of feminism in this age that is so corrupting the minds it's everywhere if anything i have in mind is over the last 10 years seeing facebook posts where message believers are have been heavily under the influence of modern day feminist thought if that's anything that i have in mind that's what i have in mind nobody's life here i'm not thinking about your life what you're doing this is a principle in god's word and i want to encourage all of us to not be under the influence of the evil spirits in this age but to under under the influence and leadership of the holy ghost by the word of god so all of human history up until like the seven mid 1700s it was agrarian societies that means they were farming societies divided into basically landowners and lower classes it's more complicated than that but just for simplification purposes that's what the world was like people had land they had servants they had people that helped them and assisted them with that land so when we're looking at proverbs 31 what are we talking about we're talking about someone who owns land and property has servants etc there is a there is a picture that's being placed there so we have to understand the picture and see it in our day and age and we can't dislocate it from the rest of scripture either all right so then the industrial revolution come during that time the agrarian society husband and wife's roles are clear obvious and basically undisputed everyone understood the man was stronger so he should go work in the field the woman should stay home and prepare the the meals take care of the children and work on other things that have been taken out of the field to prepare them so that they can sell them right and so that was the whole whether you were rich or poor you were somewhere along these lines doing it you could have been so rich that you were just commanding people to do all this all these things but there's all there's just different layers and different levels understand it that way so then the industrial revolution comes in the mid 1700s through the mid-1800s that's the birth of industry in the middle class rolls are still mostly clear but are starting to get a little bit muddier all right so that that's in the time from mid 1700s through early 1900s um then we come into like the 1940s we have the age of mass production and so this flowers blurs the lines of the roles of men and women even further and then we get the digital revolution and it's like what lines and what we are today we don't even know if you're man or woman or one day you might be a woman another day next day you might be a man you might might be homosexual one day next day you might be trans sexual i don't even know what you can't keep track with it track of it is so nonsense but that that's the blurring that's the blurring of the lines that this great development called the industrial revolution brought forward to us today at the same time the industrial revolution happens not i shouldn't say the same time but 100 years late after the beginning of the industrial revolution you see the rise of feminism and we'll get into that a little bit more but i'm going to go back to the proverbs 31 ladies say can you please stop i'm just trying to do homeschool and keep the house from being a disaster why are you talking about the proverbs 31 if i can just get the kids to finish homeschool i think it's a today it's a victory all right that's that's that's true and yeah and yet i think let's all all of us men and women let's aspire let's aspire to be following the principles of the word amen where where did i leave she seeks wool and flax and works willingly with her hands she's like the merchant ships she brings her food from afar she rises also while it is yet night and gives meat to her household in a portion to her maidens she considers she so she gets up early in the morning my goodness she considers a field and buys it with the fruit of her hands she plants a vineyard she girds her loins with strength and strengthens her arms she perceives that her merchandise is good her candles goes not out by night she lays her hands to the spindle and her hands hold the distaff she stretches out her hand to the poor yay she reaches forth her hands to the needy she's not afraid of the snow for her household for all her household are clothed with scarlet she makes herself coverings of tapestry her clothing is silk and purple her husband is known in the gates when he sits among the elders of the field hey that's not fair he's just sitting around and she's doing all the work that's not what it's saying when he's sitting in the gates it means he's a he's a judge so he was a judge judging cases so you know that that was his responsibility that's how he was meeting the needs of his family she was working and involved in the process of running the household that's what's being said here that's this isn't saying she did it all by herself no one to help she was i mean this woman is beyond amazing no it's saying she managed she managed her home she had maidens that means she had maid servants to help and do these processes that it's talking about but she was looking to the needs of her home she was looking to the future right to provide for the needs she's saying i'm not afraid for this i know snow is coming so let's prepare clothing again in the home all right don't crucify me it puts the woman solidly in the home overseeing her children her family and the needs that they have she's not out running all over the place all over the world and neglecting her home and family she is taking care of her home and family the husband is out of the house providing for the needs of the family better stop she looks well to the ways of her household and eats not the bread of idleness her children arise up and call her blessed her husband also and he praises her many daughters have done virtuously but thou excellest them all favor or charm is deceitful listen to this listen to this this is god's viewpoint charm is deceitful and beauty is vain vain means it's it's purposeless it's it's pointless but a woman that fears the lord she shall be praised there's gonna be a beautiful branch of the lord in the last days this is that woman the woman that fears the lord she shall be praised give her listen to this give her of the fruit of her hands and let her own works praise her in the gates again it doesn't say let her works praise her husband in the gates it might do that but the reality is the the bible is saying let let her get credit for the work that she's done in to provide and meet the needs of the home and and say and lift this up and say this is the example of a godly woman this is what god wants to see a manager of a household taking care of their family taking care of different needs looking to the future not fearing the future but preparing for the future i think there's there's one of the i can't remember which portion there in another translation it says that she laughs at the time to come she's she has faith she's not afraid of it she laughs at the times to come she's prepared because the word of god says to prepare but also she's not in fear because she knows that god is her provider all right so again you say well i'm not i'm not a homesteader so how does this exactly work together to help meet the needs of the household if if i need help with something and she can your wife can help then fine work together if she needs help on something you help your wife dish whether it be washing dishes or making a meal or whatever it might be you you you come you're a team you work together i'm not trying to blur or blend the roles when it comes to that i think the scripture is clear absolutely clear and yet at the same time at the same time it it gives us that picture that we're one right there's a oneness between husband and wife we help each other we complete each other men stop elbowing each other back there this isn't meant for elbowing love you guys so my goodness where are we at so in in we were talking about clarifying feminism i'm kind of just getting there now so the there's they talk about there's three different waves of feminism that happened back in like the 1850s um there was a rise of resistance against some things regarding property rights and opposition to so in in most of the world christian world marriage was um it was a covenant and so like in england a woman that was single she had the right to own property and to conduct business in her own name but as soon as she was married the law said you're you're now one husband and wife are one so whatever is done needs to be done in the name of the husband so now she she couldn't whatever property she had before that became supposed to become their property of course in a society that's full of people that are not born again it basically whatever was her property became his property in a christian home that that's true that's true whatever is our property whatever is his property becomes their property whatever is her property becomes their property right when we're in a covenant of oneness man shall leave his father and mother and cleave to his wife the two will be one flesh whatever i have belongs to my wife whatever she has belongs to me we're in this thing together we're we're one well the abuse of that in the 18th and 19th centuries raised up this spirit of feminism in order to erase that idea that was the start of it it was that and the vote i'm just going to state facts i'm not going to put judgments on anything i'm just going to state what happened we'll go to the word and let the word speak for itself but it was focused on women gaining the vote and it was focused on getting rid of this idea that women cannot own their own property all right that was the basically the first wave of that and within that they had this they started planting this idea that the that the biblical understanding that the husband is the head of the wife that needs to get thrown out so then the second wave of feminism was like the 1960s women's liberation challenging all the cultural and uh norms and the validity of what they call quote unquote the patriarchy you hear that spoken about basically the social and sexual hierarchies that they feel were used to control and limit the legal and physical independence of women in society again this is the world this is the world this is the spirit of dev of the devil what is the what is the word what is the how does the devil work by the tree of the knowledge of good and evil there's some good things there's some bad things i'm not here to pass judgment on every single aspect of feminism i i told you at the beginning what i was condemning and what i was not condemning all right there's a lot of abuses and mistreatment of women that was used and still is used in society has nothing to do with scripture but people will take take that feminists will take that and say see the bible is wrong has nothing to do sexual harassment has nothing to do with the bible it absolutely condemns a man for such behavior but they take that they take that and they put that over the whole thing and that's not right that's the devil that's how the devil works he works in these little increments as we talked about blurring the lines blurring the lines blurring the lines until at the end what do we have in america nobody knows even what they are nobody knows who they are what they are why they are they don't know they don't know anything about themselves isn't it funny that they don't know anything about themselves when the very thing that god is doing in the world is revealing to his people this is exactly who you are this is who i made you to be isn't it strange that god would send the spirit of elijah in the middle of the 20th century right before he came what happened in the 1920s oh women women can wear pants women can cut their hair they can wear makeup they can wear earrings all of that stuff never existed before the 1920s now all of a sudden there's this development to this place where women are throwing off everything they're throwing off everything and saying i don't need to obey the word i don't need to follow scripture i don't need to have a husband as the head i can do everything a man can do you might be able to that doesn't mean we're supposed to there's a lot of things i could do doesn't mean i'm supposed to do that it doesn't mean god designed me to do that but that's what the world is feeding children young people don't feed on the world it's literally put in front of you 24 7. every cartoon every advertisement every magazine every worldly book every cart every pbs cartoon is trying to indoctrinate children you say well they don't think they're just trying to produce entertainment there's a demon behind it there's demons behind it and what is it doing it's trying to show the children do not follow the word of god i have liberation for you i have freedom for you it's bondage to hell that's what it is there's only one kind of freedom and then that that's when god sets you free to live the kind of life that god originally created man and woman to live so now we have the third wave of feminism which is express yourself you can express your body in any way that you want to of course that's coming also at the same time expose yourself to the world but sexual harassment is bad we we don't like sexual harassment we don't find like any kind of expression of um what are you doing you're literally insane you're exposing your entire body to the world and then someone makes a comment some unregenerate sinner man makes a comment to you and you're you're saying oh i'm just i'm triggered i just can't even handle what are you're insane the world is absolutely insane but i have a right to express my body the way i want and i don't need someone else's eyes to violate me okay whatever you're insane you're insane that's not how the the the mind of man works that's not how the mind it's literally all of it is designed to deceive you look at even makeup you say oh it's not a big deal i was listening to i'm not always a fan of what he says but jordan peterson and they're talking about why do we have makeup in the workplace and everyone was laughing at him and making fun of him what in the world are you talking about of course they could have makeup in the work place but he said do you know why makeup is done the way it is you put makeup on your cheek it's red what why why do they do that because when sorry kids when you're when when a man and a woman are coming together what happens is the cheeks turn red the cheeks flush the whole the whole thing is an expression of sexuality wearing makeup the the lips turn red when that when that happens between a man and a woman the purpose is not just to be presentable it's you know you hear i got to put on my war paint yeah it's the war pain of the satanic war that's happening between the angels of god and the demons are coming together that's why you call it warp i gotta put on my warping i gotta i gotta put my face on you know what that means you're a fake you don't understand what you're doing and why you're doing it i'm not against the women that do that they're just ignorant you don't have to be ignorant you don't have to just sort of well i'm just going to dance a little bit with the devil just a minute no we don't need to dance with the devil at all the purpose of wearing makeup is to a sexualize a woman why do you want to be sexualized because there's a spirit behind you trying to use you and misuse you and abuse you to take another person to hell with you i'm speaking harsh because i love you because i don't want to see any of our girls destroyed by the spirit of this world everything is blurred everything is fuzzy the world makes it that way because you're looking at things in the world but the spirit of god brings the truth and it's clear and it's simple and it's easy to understand why why does god say a woman should dress modestly because god wants to repress the women i'm laughing because why because i i know what god wants what does he want just what he made the man to be the head for to protect you why well you say that's the man's fault if he looks it is the man's fault if he looks it's also your fault for presenting yourself if you go into a room filled with dynamite with a torch first of all you're stupid second of all you're asking for an explosion so what do you think you're doing you're going around amongst unregenerate men dressing sexy exposing your body wearing makeup what in the world do you think is going to happen yes they are to blame the blame is not only on you if you did that amongst born again men they would just go okay uh gotta look the other way but you're not doing it amongst born again man you're doing it amongst slaves to sin god puts these limitations on us to protect us in a fallen world god set biblical manhood and biblical womanhood in order to protect us in a fallen world and to express himself through the family a family following the word of god is a beautiful reflection of him why am i talking about this beautiful branch of the lord because without that beautiful branch of the lord the woman who's living in surrender to god we have we don't have an expression of who the bride of christ truly is we don't have that and we don't have a part of god's very expression sisters you're living modestly you're following the order of the bible you're expressing the invisible god you're making god visible in front of the people what would you rather do in life than that really when it comes down to it when it comes down to the very end of life what would you rather spend your life doing fulfilling your flesh through the world's version of liberation or do you want to be an expression of god so that when you get there in that day your whole faith your whole trust was in the lord you say i trust you command these things in your word lord i love you and i want to walk in them i want to live in them i want to be an expression of them when you get to that day if the lord tarries and you're laying on your deathbed it's a day of rejoicing it's not a day to be sorry other people will be so sorrowful because you are such an expression of him and they love him so they love you but for you it's not a day of sorrow it's not a day of worry it's not a day of fear it's your birthday amen musicians if you'd come brother branham talks about the vision that he had of the two churches the vision of the bride and the vision of the worldly church he says i remember that night before i seen that i seen the preview of the bride i stood there and seen a beautiful little lady just correctly dressed in things marching this way there was somebody standing by me in the vision and i seen they said the preview of the bride i seen her go by they come to this side and went around i heard it coming up the church is up coming up from this other side there come so he's saying there's the bride on one side and there's the worldly churches on the other side there come the asian church oh you talk about filth here come the european church oh my and then i heard a rock and roll coming then i heard rock and roll coming modern praise and worship music and it was miss america the church and she didn't even have any clothes on wow she had papers like newspapers my if that is an expression of the

what's going on in the news she's not dressed with the word she's dressed with newspapers gray hold in front of her dancing by rock and roll miss america the church and then when them women pass by
