to um make them south carolinians amen praise the lord amen don't resist resistance is futile we're gonna we're gonna change you amen praise the name of the lord we got a number of prayer requests that we want to go to this morning and i want to go right into the lesson this morning and uh let me get these prayer requests here before we read our scripture um there's a young lady who's written before actually when i first read it it was from uh amber gonzalez and i thought oh wow amber's got a prayer request but it's a different amber in this case thank the lord it's a different amber because this is a very serious need about her mother let's see out there is her mother grandmother um oh yeah it's her mother who had a stroke and she's in very serious condition in a coma there seems to be some type of awakeness like her eyes but she's not fully and they can't seem to bring her out of it um they they try to get her to move her head um you know but they're not getting a lot of response and now they're starting to be organ failure so this sister has written to us before and apparently streams i don't think i know her personally but i'm not sure where she's writing from but she's asked us if we'll pray for her mom i love how she ends it she's looking for a miracle but whatever god wills be done um in my mother's life i tell you that's a real surrendered heart when you can just say whatever is the perfect will of god then that's a real surrendered heart um brother brad yance is away ministering brother matt as a way ministering want to be praying for them sister debbie's home uh sick this morning and um and want to be praying for her kind of looks like she caught the same hopefully it's just a little 48-hour thing like i had and i was over it pretty quickly but uh she started running a fever yes uh last night and this morning so just be praying for her also for me i'm traveling i was gonna be leaving today after service i'm gonna wait and stay with her through the night leave early in the morning and drive to north carolina her uncle passed away he was in his early 70s rather unexpected still and brother richard's brother younger brother gary so they've asked me to come up they had actually been gary and sarah had been streaming our services for the last couple years so uh we know that he died in the faith and uh we want to just be praying for sister sarah tester and that whole family amen and be praying for me on the road to preach that funeral tomorrow it's going to try to drive up north carolina preach if you don't drive all the way back home and so just keep me in prayer for strength for that so a number of these needs here before so i didn't have any other ones that that came in but i'm sure you might have one today you'd want to say lord remember my need today amen oh i did i did get another one here sister emily i'm sorry um sister emily curtis our son-in-law asked the church to pray for his firefighter interview it's his fourth and it's a long one two hours in front of a panel of people so it's a really important job a transition for him so let's ask the lord's blessing upon that amen praise god let's just go to prayer and we will pray with these needs in prayer with the reading of the word and then we'll have our scripture father we stand here today lord humble before you asking for your help this is a an amazing day lord for your bride realizing lord what we've been called to in this hour realizing also the challenges lord of the enemy who as the prophet would say he's your enemy and our enemy and lord we're appealing to you now for help today because your enemy and our enemy lord buffets us tries to keep us off track from receiving everything that god has for us in this hour we are committing ourselves to you fresh this morning we're asking for your word now lord to be powerful and effectual in our lives we're believing that you'll do it we know as we read our scripture that you of course have already blessed your word your word constantly there's a blessing just hearing it read there's a blessing in reading it and hearing it read that's pretty powerful but lord we need your blessing we need the blessing to be now upon the hearer to let the anointing of the composer come upon us so that we might be able to assimilate lord what we hear today because otherwise lord it just becomes words to us and so that would be dreadful if we were in that condition don't let that be so lord help us today to learn what we need to learn from your word i've have quite a bit of investment of time and thought into this little series we've been on so we're committing it to you today i commit myself to you as a servant as a vessel lord they're sick and afflicted among us there's needs that we've read out before you here's a young woman with her mother laying between life and death and only you lord only you can make the next decision she's committing it she's asking us to pray we join our sister amber lord in prayer and faith believing for her mom we we trust you lord for your perfect will in this matter we're remembering our ministers traveling we're remembering our sick and afflicted among us we're remembering father uh this young man in this interview i pray for your great grace upon it be with me now lord as the duty that faces me lord tomorrow to make a long drive to speak some words of comfort to a family may you be a great comfort to them we committed all to you today and lord believing that you'll do it in jesus name amen god bless you friends god bless you two books before the book of malachi you'll find the little tiny book of haggai it's hard to find so i'll help you help you find it amen to everybody knows where malachi is amen so just two books ahead of that right right before the ending of the old testament we want to look at haggai chapter 2. amen by the help of the lord i want to continue today on part 4 of what is the church of god amen haggai chapter 2 and we want to read a prophecy here that paul's going to pick up in the 12th chapter of hebrews and he's going to we're going to try to qualify this um and show you what it's uh what it's about and when it's about and what's going on uh when it's happening all right haggai chapter two and we'll go verses 6-9 for thus saith the lord of hosts yet once it is a little while and i will shake the heavens and the earth and the sea and the dry land and i will shake all nations and the desire of all nations shall come and i will fill this house with glory saith the lord of host the silver is mine and the gold is mine saith the lord of hosts the glory of this latter house shall be greater than of the former saith the lord of hosts and in this place will i give peace saith the lord of host so this beautiful promise uh that'll be know it's great fulfillment in the millennial reign but we we realize that you know the millennial reign isn't just something that just happens to happen there's a building up toward a millennial reign because the millennial reign is the kingdom of our lord remember and of his christ amen the kingdoms of this world shall be the kingdoms of our lord and of his christ amen and so we realize the kingdoms of our lord and of his christ we've taught on this before is the lord jesus and his bride amen and so we we've been preaching about uh the kingdom because uh when we talk about the church of god what is the true church of god it is the kingdom of god in the earth it is the mystical not natural supernatural mystical union between christ and his bride invisible to the world but very plain to those who have been born again amen and so it is a uniting time and we are filled and surrounded with uniting times and signs amen so let's let's uh let's let you have your seats may god bless the reading of his word god bless you you can be seated brother rhone you're still on for today amen praise the lord we've got a baptism after service today and baptize our young men come back to my office after the service last weekend and amen uh looking at a man whose fox's tale was on fire amen and wants to be baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ had this message witnessed to him by a good friend and made some contact with voice of god and they recommended him to this assembly because of the area he lives in savannah so we're happy to welcome him among us and the family of god we're going to baptize him today's fully surrendered his whole heart and life to the lord amen and and and ready to say amen to everything god has done in this hour not wonderful amen the lord steal heals the lord steal saves amen you mean you know that that that never the blood never loses its power you always want to remember that friends the same church today if brother branham said if it's the true church of god it writes another book of acts behind it amen and so we're happy for that today sister jean in her testimony when she was just a young woman uh she'd give her heart to the lord in a baptist church and her and brother eddie driving along they kept passing by this little video rundown building wasn't you know half a nothing building and uh i spent i spent many a a a service many hours in that little rundown building in service when i was a young teenager but when they would drive by it they had a sign out front that it was real simple just cut to the chase said jesus heals jesus saves this is genius like what does that mean what does that mean jesus heals jesus saves and so you know that was enough to get him in the door of course brother eddie said on the back row and when everything when the holy spirit broke out and everybody started screaming and shouting brother eddie said lord if you get me out of here i promise i'll never come back again oh my was that ever the beginning of a new life a whole new world for brother eddie and sister gene so we're loving god today and we want to just look into the word now and talk about this true church of god now last time and have my powerpoint uh ready thank you g and you're gonna run it back there yeah because i'm not set up to run it here we have it set up i just haven't got around to it yet amen brother jd we keep forgetting to do that but we'll get to it amen but um we've been looking and last time in part three we took uh somebody get me some water i think uh brother matt there you go brother luther amen he might be coming with it but i don't know uh he's not in the building yet but amen so we took uh revelation 8 1 and when he had opened the seventh seal there was silence in heaven about the space of half an hour now we know that when brother branham uh preached on the church ages in the revelation of jesus christ series from which the church age book was largely written of course it was everything that had came out of the seals also all the all the greater and deeper understandings that came to us with the opening of the seals but one of the things that we don't find brother branham ever altered and i can't find anywhere where he ever amended this statement as brother jd thinks sir as brother jd was showing us this morning there were things of progression to william branham as god continued to progress his understanding and to the degree that even when the seals would open brother branham would even make statements like you know his bible practically had become a brand new book and we realized that even from there it wasn't even finished it didn't all happen on those eight days there at penn street that two years later he's preaching what is the attraction on the mountain and he's just he's just enthralled with what happened back there on sunset mountain in the coronado forest north of tucson and he it's almost as if he's he's really grasping it now and it's really picking up steam and brother branham now is able to charge full steam to the time when the lord would take him from the earth and the lord took brother branham from the earth for one reason and one reason alone his mission was finished amen he didn't have anything to complete the the the final completion of the word and fulfillment would be accomplished by the bride under her prophet's ministry amen so we see that so clearly we don't struggle with that we've grown over the years we understand who we are and where we are in the word we we our our understanding it must always be subject to we're not here to redo the shout the shout doesn't need redoing we're here to be the lived voice of that shout amen and so one of the things that i cannot find where brother branham ever altered was when he interpreted this first verse of chapter 8 and when he had opened the seventh seal there was silence in heaven about the space of half an hour brother branham shows in the church age in the revelation of jesus christ series that heaven was empty for about the space of a half an hour and so i'm not here to cabbage down on that and try to and it's a little bit ambiguous exactly to what extent and what that means and i understand there's been preaching about the saints being here and hearing our services i don't i'm not here to i don't know no comment amen i'm not here to preach on that don't get me outside and ask me about it because i'm telling you all i know right now but but but but i but i do know this that that that that revelation chapter 8 verse 1 was a monumental event and we do understand that there is a presence of christ that came at the end time according to all prophecy where there would be an invisible union in his bride that would do this it would take the omega bride further than any bride of any age had ever got to go it will take her all the way to a body change now we're not suggesting at all and i think it's erroneous teaching to suggest that our understanding would supersede william branham or that william branham's understanding would supersede saint paul i think that's not true but i do fee i do am aware that the alpha church fell away before they could go into a body change i do know that the omega bride won't do that she is predestinated to not do that she's predestinated to go in a rapture and so we we see this in balance and we don't get out of balance with it but but it's it's important for you to understand that that what this would have restored to us would have been the full uh effects of the kingdom of god in earth all right now by that i mean when you you know there's nothing that we believe doctrinally that paul didn't teach us people couldn't figure it all out and took a profit to come at the end time and get it all restored back and now it's clear amen but we realize that that what fell on the in the upper room was a promise of the father that's what peter told them this is what james taught this is what they all taught this is these men aren't drunk like you're thinking but this is god keeping his word this is a promise this is a jubilee this is the 50. this is pentecost this is what 4 000 years of old testament history have been about we now have the jubilee we now have the not just a god above us or with us but now in us we not we don't we don't just have tables of stone but now he's written the word in our hearts amen and this now this now re restores the abstract title to the church and so that that's why paul could say there's now therefore no condemnation to them which are in christ because that church had come to their jubilee that church had come to an abstract title that church had come to real justification now that all got lost down through the ages and therefore the power which was always proportionate to the presence of god in the word of that hour the power ran proportionally and that's why brother branham when he comes to azusa he explains that one of the benefits of the azusa revival was that the church didn't really wasn't really they had justification under luther's restoration they had sanctified living under wesley's reformation but the church was lacking the the kind of power that they ought to have like the early book of acts church did and so god brings back a fresh anointing of the holy spirit of power and the gifts begin to operate again but even that wasn't the final picture there had to come a jubilee again there had to come a full abstract there had to come a token there had to be a restoration of the word at the end time because that last day bride was going to get a body change and that was going to take rapturing faith and since faith comes by hearing the word you're never going to get a rapturing faith unless you have a rapturing word and the rapturing word is the full word not a partial word we've explained that this is why he was alpha and omega this is why he's the first and the last and brother brandon would point out when he's standing there in the midst of seven lamp stands he's standing in the middle of it he's meaning he's walking in the midst of it he's in his church the whole time but his brother ben says like his hands are outstretched from alpha to omega but brother branham said notice there's nothing mentioned about in the middle yeah see it's the it's the alpha the omega it's the first and the last does that mean he wasn't in the middle no he certainly was in the middle but not everything in the middle was him there were things in the middle that were man-made ideology mingled and mixed with it amen you get that you see that picture i'm sure but but at the end time at the alpha there had to be a restoration uh uh uh in the omega of the alpha so that now he's the first and the last he's the amen he's the all of it and that's where we are friends you understand that's why this bride is going to go further than any other church age has ever been able to go she has become more a greater level of the living word than was ever possible and he said well where's her where's her book of acts all right we'll get to that in just in a minute don't want to get ahead of myself now let's let's pull up my powerpoint and we'll catch i only put up one quote uh so you guys didn't get the uh the one frets off of that says part three it's okay it's the same one i'd just amend it to say part four let's go to the next screen all right all right now we're only going to read this one quote and then i'm gonna you can take the powerpoint down brother brown in 1963 the world is falling apart what are we looking for friends what are we the real church is looking not for denomination not looking for a president not looking for a genius to rise up but they're looking for a kingdom and a king to come amen now you might hopefully you'll understand why i don't care if donald trump retakes the white house you'll understand why i don't lose sleep over sleepy joe sitting there now i don't care it would be impossible for me to care less than i already don't what got you blinking i'm not looking for a president i'm not looking for a genius to rise up here's what the real church they're looking for a kingdom and a king to come what is the kingdom is that a fair question would you like to know elijah's going to tell you what is the kingdom it's on earth now it's a spirit mystical body of christ in there in this kingdom they've come out of presbyterian methodist pentecostals and everything everything the bar rooms everything all right next slide they're in this kingdom they're this mystical one they're born in there they come in there by the baptism of the holy spirit and they're in this kingdom and we're looking for a king to come to this kingdom that'll set his kingdom up where here all right that'll set his kingdom up here on earth i'm so glad for that on his throne the throne of david that's the millennium all right he shall rule and reign forever that's what the church looks for so my my world view as brother matt was teaching us our world view is different from the world we have a completely different world view i don't view politics and science and education and religion and the social fabric and social trends i don't even view it like the world it's alien to me and i'm alien to it that's a born again believer that's why you're you're mystical you're mystic see and so you you live here in this natural world but you also live after the you live after the life of your rebirth amen see you don't just live after the life you came into this earth with that's your biology all right but a real believer lives after the kingdom of the rebirth amen my whole life is patterned after the kingdom of my rebirth so i'm an oddball to the world i'm a nut to the world i don't go with their trends they don't understand it i don't i don't understand why they don't understand they say you're you're strange well you're strange not you're strange thinking i'm strange because i'm acting the original way what's your problem amen amen so i mean who is the crazy one here see i mean if if i'm living after the order of my maker and you're not then who's crazy see so so we realize that he goes on here now watch so he says that's what the church looks for next slide and the good thing about it now you ready for some good news the good thing about it friends is think of this before we get to this kingdom in the millennium before this kingdom comes in the millennium now we can sit together in heavenly places in christ jesus already already you have to wait for the millennium you can sit with him right now lifted up above the shadows of all the corruption of the world and all their television programs and all their these other nonsense they got on the earth today they got a lot of nonsense amen all their rotten pollution and system and everything be lifted up in heavenly places and the holy spirit himself come upon us and speak out and call to us our sins thank god thank god come on call to us our sins thank god say why you're so thankful because i don't want to be sinful i hate being sinful all right watch he'll call it out to us all right i mean listen if if you didn't need him to do that you'd already be in the rapture so climb down off of your high horse you're not in the rapture you got issues all right watch now the pollution can't we so relate to that all their rotten pollution and systems and everything this is why i i sometimes i just i try my best sometimes to gently talk people back from the edge they get all bent over political issues and all kind of nonsense and they just get all twisted up and that's just exactly what the devil wants to happen see and so and and and we're lifted up in heavenly place and the holy spirit himself come upon us and speaks out and call to us our sins and tell us i'm thankful he doesn't just call me out as a sinner he tells me how to get straightened up and what we've done in life and what we're what we're doing in other words what your life's been about what it's supposed to be and what's happening in the future i want you to understand this everything that's happening i don't need to explain every last detail of it to you i can just tell you that everything that's happened in your life has been purposed by god and i'm not saying god caused you to stumble or fail but i'm here to tell you god knew you would and he's been watching with his hand upon you the whole time anyway knowing he would win you back thank god thank god amen when you're out there in sin and you should have died a bunch of times god had his hand on you and wouldn't let the devil take you because god knew someday he'd reclaim you hallelujah and and god god got a hold of my life but sometimes we find ourselves straight away from the master but you know what he knows he's going to perfect me anyhow he's not he doesn't lose sleep over my weaknesses thank god for that he knows how to correct me and i just say lord i just by whatever means necessary amen that is my trust in him i wouldn't give i wouldn't offer that kind of carte blanche to somebody i didn't trust amen lord what whatever you have to do even if it's so horrible and tragic that i cry river of tears i know in the end i'll be thankful i know when it's all said and done i'll be glad you did it so i'm just going to go ahead and commit my whole life to you and all my family and all my children grandchildren loved ones and the church and everybody and to say whatever you need to do lord just have at it because i know every decision you make will be made in love and i know you've got a purpose and i know you got a vision and i know someday we're going to be around father's throne and we'll be glad that he knew how to get us there now watch here's here comes the rub ready ready for this next one you buckled up next screen all right see that's the actually the second one down but let's finish this spirit jesus christ the same yesterday and forever that's the king that shall come to his kingdom someday and his kingdom is now being established now right now in the hearts of the people here on earth now here we go that you what did you do now here's your problem prophet's going to tell your problem you put a true story magazine on your table instead of the bible instead of prayer meetings you had to run out somewhere and do something else it doesn't even say it's sinful just simply said instead of prayer meeting you did something else you just did we had prayer meeting but you were just you just did something else we had sunday service but well you just did something else and it poisons you and it poisons your children it poisons your grandchildren it brings problems in the church because instead of pursuing the kingdom you pursue other stuff amen amen now can i tell you something i purpose in my heart to do today not teaching but i purpose to slow down because last sunday we had quite a jubilee amen and i knew in my notes that we're going to get a little more we're going to bring the space shuttle down out of the sky and his rubber tires are going to meet the road so this is where the rubber of the space shuttle meets the landing strip road okay that be okay so watch but what did you do in other words why are you not enjoying this union this kingdom it's here now it's right now you can live in heavenly places it's it's here to be effectual effective in your life what's wrong why aren't you writing a book of acts see see the so he says here's what happened you you put a true story magazine on your table instead of the bible just replace true story magazine with anything that's not the all right bible just put you you did something else you went somewhere and do and and do something else just put what you went somewhere and do something else put put anything in place of that that's not coming to prayer meeting amen amen that's what's the matter with our so-called christians dancing parties social drinking and oh everything see it's parent delinquency not child delinquency the parent is delinquent that's the one now he's not saying that every parent is you know a beatnik or or a ricky or whatever he you used to term that he just simply saying you know you should have had the bible prominent in your home but you had a lot of other things prominent over the bible your schedule should have been to be at the house of god your schedule should have been to be at prayer meetings your schedule should have been a prayer closet that's what the priorities of your life ought to have been and the reason that you have you say what's what's the matter with me that's what's a matter that's why you have problems unresolved that's why marriages aren't as healthy as they need to be that's why young people take a longer than it should to get the holy ghost sometimes it takes teenagers years and years and years to get something that takes two seconds amen and it's not always a problem in the teenager it's a problem because there were too many other things in the home besides the bible there was too much other going somewhere other than to the house of god amen now come on we rejoiced last week oh we loved that study in the book of revelation didn't we all right so let's just be honest before god now don't don't be dishonest you make sure you stay honest before the lord you say amen to every word so he says it's not child delinquency the parent is delinquent that's the one thank you brother jackson you can take that down and just be be ready because i'm going to have you pull up several scriptures so get that program ready to go you know it's it's amazing when we looking at our lives and you say well why why is it that that that if if i'm a child of god then okay fine thank you can i just live my life and if i'm a child of god why do you always trying to pull me into a certain direction preacher well that's what preachers do and they they they they they comfort the afflicted and they afflict the comfortable amen and so so we but but you know you know why as children of god you believe you have a seed of god well do you know why god won't let that just go it willy-nilly because the kind of seed it is it's a light seed amen remember brother branham used the analogy about a blackness and he says the blackness represented the world he said every once in a while you see a little streak of light go through there and he said that's a little believer moving through a sea of darkness a sea of blackness and there's a little streak of light moving in there that everyone's like oh there went oh there's a little streak of light and and your seed that is in you is a light seed and therefore your your whole seed is to produce light to a dark world and i'm here to tell you this family of god this multicultural multi-racial people we're made up of another kind of material if you're looking for a kingdom let me tell you why you have a desire for a kingdom because you have a different kind of seed and you're made from a different kind of material and thusly you will never ever ever ever ever did i say ever you will never ever find peace happiness and contentment until you let your little light shine amen we're made from another material male and female jew or gentile bond or free we're made of a material that doesn't buckle down to the god of this evil age and that just is and you should just rejoice to say i i i don't want to buck the system i don't want to be an outcast i don't want to get persecuted i'm sorry you're a light seed and you're a different material and god's got you here for a different reason we're of a different kingdom remember we read our in our quote brother branham said we're looking for a kingdom listen friends there's only one man leaving in the translation there's only one man leaving at rapture time i'm here to tell you there's only one man going in the translation and that's jesus christ he's brother branham said he's he's cut he sent the whole gospel for the whole man by that i mean that he you're not god's intention is not to get you in a rapture by by displaying part of christ he brother brown said he's not coming back for a deformed bride you understand so it's not a partial bride it's a full bride the full body the full man brother branham says that's the only way to the gospel of salvation the gospel of deliverance this is from sirs we would see jesus the full gospel for the full man for the full son for the full daughter all the gospel all that he said all that he done all that he promised to every person that will believe it 65 in paradox you can't go on you've got to come back to the entire full gospel it was made for the full man by a complete god who was made flesh and dwelt among us so it's not part of him taken in a rapture it's the fullness of him this is my why hence my statement the only one translating is christ you see so that's why she is him it's christ fully manifested in a bride that's the one going in the rapture see think of it friends a bride who is prophesied to come not close not similar not sort of kinda but she's literally prophesied thus saith the lord pick up your pen and write and write these words and read them back to the church this is what i'm saying every seed brings forth after its kind and in the end of it all she comes into his very image you make sure you tell her that prophet make sure that you tell her what the goal is so that if she knows what i'm doing she'll understand why i'm doing in her life what i'm doing why i won't leave them alone why i keep knocking them down and picking them up and knocking them down and picking them up why i keep the preacher hammering them and hammering them and hammering them why i won't give them sleep why i'll do whatever i got to do if i lay them flat on their back to the only way they can do is look up i'm going to make sure they look up somehow whatever i got to do because i'm i'm i'm they're they're coming into my very image some of you today some of you with not even many years under your belt can already testify i could point to several people in here and say young man young woman you could testify that the way of a transgressor is hard and god knows how to get his man see and so it's all about surrendering and not fighting that fight because you'll fight it you will surrender anyway see but his goal is that there would be those little streaks of light there'd be thousands of lived voices who would be echoing his word daily in their lives saying amen to every word and all that it calls for and our dedication to him this is what it means to be the church of god that's what the church of god is all about amen so the rapture then becomes friends this is it's people who have surrendered their lives to the kingdom order and there's a kingdom ordered everything we've been saying that you're going to say it a few more times there's an order that operates in god's kingdom and all members of his kingdom should operate according to that order and they shouldn't allow their lives you see when you have true story magazines on your table instead of the bible that's not kingdom order kingdom orders flips that kingdom order puts the bible there and puts put the true story magazines in the trash kingdom order is not doing other things somewhere else when it's prayer meeting kingdom order is have your family at prayer meeting and if you've got time to do other things fine because you're supposed to be seeking that kingdom and its righteousness first in your life say i i i gotta i gotta work i gotta make money and jesus said you're not even considered the sparrow you you know you haven't even even thought about the lily here you are chasing fair you know all you're going to do is get chained up to pharaoh's chariot chasing fortune and glory you're just going to be a slave to it those people who do that aren't happy they still jump out of 50-story buildings they still live on tranquilizers and od all the time hollywood's filled with them sports stars do it all the time check out early committing suicide why because there's no happiness in that there's all kinds of pleasure but there's no happiness see it's just poisonous so those who have surrendered their lives to kingdom order the rapture say brother jason what is the rapture the rapture is when he has taken he the rapture is when remember i said there's only one going in the translation and that's the full christ amen all right and it's made up of many pieces his body is made up of of saints around the world in every culture every creed every race every gender you got me every doesn't matter he's got many pieces to this body of christ that he's perfecting and the rapture is when he has all the pieces perfectly formed all the pieces brought to their position then all the pieces are suddenly uh uh assembled and taken up to glory that's the rapture say it again when he's got all the pieces perfected and all the pieces in their order in kingdom order then he then suddenly oh he comes out of glory and the dead saints rise and then he takes all of those perfected pieces and he assembles them all together and it's one body going home amen that's what the rapture is all about you're privileged to know it that way friends would say some teenagers you're privileged to know that it's not as the world thinks that a giant conveyor a giant escalator is going to drop down out of the sky gabriel's going to step forward blow a trumpet and a red carpet's going to come down jesus is going to walk down and say okay everybody we're going home now fly off course cars crashed off the street i don't know what what will happen you know when this bride leaves but i know this i ain't looking for a conveyor belt i ain't looking for an escalator i've already heard a trumpet sound hallelujah i've already heard a shout a voice that come up higher hallelujah and that's where my life is i've already heard that sometimes the kingdom life requires us to think king it doesn't just sometimes it always requires us to think in kingdom thoughts now that's easier said than done sometimes um and and and the thing that that really really gets in the way and let's just i'm gonna use a a bad word here you ready i'm sorry to say this in front of your children pride it's one of the baddest words you can say is pride see you know something friends you know what brother jason has found in my life you know how i stay little in my own sight because i i've not ever been too victorious you know conquering spiritual mountains for the lord i've i've tried and struggled and went around the world preaching the gospel but i always feel like i'm behind the eight ball i always feel like i'm playing catch up i'm just being honest with you i always feel that way about myself and it just seemed like i'm always repenting for mediocrity lord i'm so sorry why do you fool with me goodness i'd have kicked me to the curb so long ago and then i then i rolled on the other side and raised up my hands and cried and said thank you for not kicking me to the curb thank you for staying with me thank you for keep going thank you for not quitting me lord hallelujah i'm going to tell you something friends the weight the the way to avoid thinking more highly of yourself than you should is to make sure you stand in front of two mirrors see a lot of people go in front of a mirror and pride fills them with vanity pretense um what's the word entitlement people get a sense of entitlement like the world owes them teenagers get a sense of entitlement like my parents oh me husbands get a sense of entitlement wives get that preachers get that people get a sense of entitlement you see because they stand in front of that mirror and they look at their image and they primp and they pose and and and they make all of these great plans to how great their life can be and how beautiful they can become and what they can accomplish and you know that you know they they've earned their place at the top of the at the top of the heap and and i would just simply say to you leave that mirror and go stand in front of this one because if you'll stand in front of this mirror you'll come back to that mirror thinking different you'll stand in when you stand in front of this mirror friends i want to give you a little life lesson that i've practiced and i've learned when you are willing to go stand in front of this mirror and let it tell you about you when you go back to the other mirror you're just so glad to be alive you feel privileged to even be able to stand there and pray a prayer you you realize that if it wasn't for the grace of god you you were on you were on your way to death and you couldn't save yourself and there's nothing you could do about it if he hadn't had mercy on you you'd be nothing and we're still nothing he's on he only he's everything at the end jesus said when the servant has done all that has asked of him he shall still say i was the lord's unprofitable servant see and and and that that will humble you because you'll be so aware you'll be so painfully aware you know what you you know you know what standing in front of this mirror has done for jason you know what it's done for me brother jason watkins pastor jason you know what the standing front of this mirror has done for me because i stand in front of this mirror when i go stand in the other mirror and i look at that guy staring back at me i realize that that that guy looking at me far more than lucifer is my greatest enemy amen can i say that again when i stare in this mirror and then i go look at the other mirror i realize that i that that that i am more my own enemy far more than lucifer has ever been a great enemy i'm the one you know uh and and and and i'm the one that needs brought under subjection to the word there's no sense blaming the devil he's never going to be subject to the word he's that window is passed for him he made that choice aeons ago so i'm not here to try to reform the devil i'm here to try to look at that man in the mirror and say repent because only in christ are you are you worth anything at all and only by the mercy of god do i even stand here today as a believer that is the that's what the real church of god is amen so nobody gets entitled to to think more highly of themselves than they ought it'll cure your pride you know right quick i promise you that this order of the kingdom that i'm speaking about today this should you should desire this kingdom this kingdom way this kingdom lifestyle you have a hope of the resurrection four people you have a hope of the resurrection 70 of the people do you have a hope of the resurrection i sure hope you do see and and and if you desire that resurrection then your desire you should desire this order of the kingdom in your life more than your daily bread or the breath you breathe in your lungs it should be that paramount to you you know you you you you will want to i you know to where you to where you you will want to want this more than all your other wants amen because we're humans we have other wants amen not saying you know you're going to be a monk and live in a commune you live in the world paul said that you can't even you know paul said you should you should leave the world and and the church wrote him back you know history shows the church wrote him back with a question what do you how do we what do you mean leave the world should we go join a commune we have jobs careers what are you saying paul we should form a form of cult and paul writes back in his second letter he says now when i said to you you should leave the world of course i wasn't meaning you live you do live here you do work here you do your whole you're here for a reason you're here to be a light so no don't go live in a commune but but also don't live here you you got to keep this in mind that while you live here you're not from here that you're from another world and while you're here you're to reflect the life of the other world that you come from to where you take all your wants and that this kingdom you end up wanting this kingdom you and and and a lot of times i can say that there's been times where i've had to be honest looking in god's mirror and say but lord i want this thing so bad and the kingdom's going to cost me that and i'm having a trouble with my own human will but here's one thing i can say i want to want that kingdom so help me and have mercy on me and come down and change my heart oh god change my heart make me want to want that kingdom now how many would say amen to that say lord i want to want your kingdom more than all my other wants see it's not about living a flawless life if you could do that jesus wouldn't have needed to die and you know one of the things that i've learned as a pastor and i heard it coined some years ago and never forgot it a pastor was just at a minister's conference and made this statement said just remember pastors that you don't have to die for your church the jesus already did that see so so i'm not here to blow your nose for you or fix all your problems i'm here to i'm a gospel preacher and i'm here to preach the gospel to you and i'm here to try to live an example before you but we're all in this thing together and you're responsible to god the same as i am responsible to god see this is what makes the true church of god not just because they say they're the church of god kingdom principles are desired in your life principles of truthfulness truthfulness in marriage truthfulness in child raising truthfulness in business truthfulness in the community purity purity of desire this is the kingdom principle where you're striving daily to have your desires purified you have to because this flesh has its own nature and it's in a fallen condition and as soon as you listen you get on a treadmill that's moving stop walking you're going to backslide and it ain't going to be fun when you crash you understand you're on a moving sidewalk going backwards over the abyss that's what brother branham he saw that that church following a witch they went off the cliff i'm here to tell you the other that little group of girls went up that's the group i want to be in so you don't stop walking you don't stop he's even paul said running this race because the world is going backwards into insanity it's going backwards into total annihilation but this bride is leaving the world so don't stop running the race this is why people find themselves backslidden not because they went out and started committing heinous acts but because they just stopped going forward and after a while they were committing heinous acts this kingdom principles of truthfulness i'm only going to go so far today because i can't get anywhere near done so we're i'm just going to catch a few more so kingdom principles what it means to be the real church of god of truthfulness and purity of desire physical morality spiritual maturity that's that that's so needed in this day for balance if you don't have spiritual maturity if you don't if you don't take the steps to acquire spiritual maturity you know what you'll be like you'd be like paul said you'll be like a child who just gets tossed to and fro and every little every little wind will just knock you off path every little thing that happens to you that that don't go your way or little thing that you don't quite agree with and it'll still just throw you right off the trail like somebody hit you in the head with an axe and we're not supposed to be that way we're supposed to be seasoned veterans of faith strong in faith and strong in spirit we should have firm commitments uh you know uh immorality should not be named once among you as paul said marriages should be strong teenagers should be full of the holy ghost the power of god should be moving constantly in our midst not just here inside this building but in our homes in our jobs wherever we go friends i'm here to tell you that the world is designed to take all of that from you and the word is designed to give it back to you and to fortify it in you the the only decision to be made is yours because you already know god's you already know his desire for your life you don't need to pray lord help me he already has determined promised you he would you don't need to say lord uh make me an overcomer well you don't need to ask him to do that he's already told you that's what he's after he's chasing it harder than you're chasing it the only decision to be made is yours say i want to be saved i want to be i want to be born again well jesus already showed his decision in that at calvary he died to make a way for that the only choice to be made is yours see and that's where we so often times go off the path is in the choices that we make these kingdom principles should be or should operate in our homes and in our families they ought to operate in our marriages i've read you this list before i'm just rehearsing it again today these kingdom principles if we call ourselves the church of god then they should be made manifest in all of our lives in our homes our home life our family life and our family interaction kingdom principles should be predominant in our marriages and i mean think about just those two just just take holmes home life what is the nuclear family marriage raising kids just those real rubber meeting the road areas and just look how twisted and perverted the world's notion of what a marriage is what the nuclear family is what it means to be honest and and moral when when they are amoral when they when morality is relative to just whatever feels good and the whole world has in mass risen against and replies against god and there's only a small few little streaks of light running through darkness saying no no the blood has never lost its power and we're still standing on the principles of god's word and i'm still going to make sure that that god's word governs my home i'm going to make sure that god's word governs me my child raising it's going to govern my marriage it's going to govern how i treat my wife or how the wife treats the husband it's going to govern our friendships it's going to govern your friendships you're not going to have friends that poison your mind you're not going to have friends whose testimony and life fly in the face of god do you know that that's exactly what hezekiah got in trouble for amen hezekiah was a righteous king and you know what got him in hot water with god god simply said to hezekiah one day why is it that you're always making my enemies your friends amen amen people who live in open vulgar defiance of me and they're your friends say well i got a witness to them okay then witness to them tell them about the love of god start witnessing to them till they either become a christian or tell you to leave them alone and go away from them because i'm here to tell you something friends if you're if your ungodly friends are comfortable around you god's not comfortable around you if you're i mean i want to say it right if your worldly friends are comfortable around you god's not comfortable around you make your choice if the world is uncomfortable with you just know god is very comfortable with you jesus made that clear they will hate you because they hated me first and see where there needs to be kingdom principles in our friendships i'm all for witnessing but i don't it doesn't take me 10 years of friendship to witness to somebody amen it doesn't take me 10 days to be around a vulgar person before i'm telling them about the life of christ how that he can deliver them and change them and bring them into the fold of christ it doesn't it doesn't take me ten hours i'm not going to give 10 hours to a vulgar person without telling them about what christ can do or i'll just won't go around them anymore see so these kingdom principles should operate in our marriages in our friendships in our homes and our families and our education nothing wrong with education brother branham wasn't opposed to education people they say he was he wasn't he wasn't a post-education he was opposed to education the pursuit of education at the detriment of your pursuit of god amen that there's nothing education's fine but just remember education civilization is of the devil amen and the coming kingdom will have no it'll have education and it'll have civilization we're not going to be sitting on a cloud playing a harp it'll have plenty of education brother brandon said it'll be an education so far above this world they won't even begin to no nothing and it'll be civilization it's going to be life we're going to live we're good there's going to be kingdoms there's going to be there's going to be uh civilization in the millennium it's going to be right here on the earth even time will seek still keep going on but but god is preparing you here to live there because you're going to be priests and kings and so if you're going to live with authority and know-how and maturity and balance there you're going to have to learn how to do it here amen amen because there's no contrast for you there the and you don't learn without that contrast you learn you have a contrast here here's where your struggle is here's where you're an overcomer see so get all the education you want but don't let it interrupt your pursuit of god our finances should have kingdom order in it we should have honorable lifestyles there should be honorable lifestyles in our in our church leadership and our ministry teams and all the officers everybody that holds a position there should be godly seasoned maturity amen there there there should be a spirit of cooperation among all the officers of a church brother branham said if you if you break the harmony he said then it's like feeding poison to the church so the leadership with the ministry and they have to stay in harmony now does does harmony mean that that they always agree that everybody always agrees no it doesn't mean that at all and fact is uh conflict resolution is a is when you learn i mean conflict is good that's how you learn that's how you improve if you're if you never have brother branham taught us that that if you never had a trial you'd just be a dish rag if you never had something a hearty time and a hard thing to go through he said you'd just be well you know wishy-washy and so the whole point of it is is to struggle so that we can overcome so that we can all work in harmony together and when a decision is made and prayer has been offered and a decision is made at the head of the leadership of a church then the whole team whether it went their way or didn't go their way they're supposed to put their shoulder to the wheel with a smile on their face and a hand raised and say glory hallelujah i'm still building a wall i'm still building a wall i got a sword in my hand and i'm building a wall that's what it was in the days of nehemiah that's what happened in the restoration when when ezra and nehemiah went back there was harmony there should be brotherhood among the saints there should be kingdom principles in our brotherhood should be honesty and integrity i remember brother eugene told me one time he said brother jason you know what a real friend is and i said what is a cowboy he said a real friend is someone who will hold you accountable amen and won't just tell you what you want to hear but tell you what you need to hear doesn't mean their friends are always right but it does mean their hearts in the right spot see our witness in the community there should be a kingdom principle and our witness in the community your life should demonstrate christ your everyday walking around talking thinking doing life should reflect the presence and power of christ that shows that you are of a different kingdom there should be kingdom order to all of this every facet of our lives and i want to tell you something friends these are the things i'll say this in closing for today we're going to hit a pause button these are the very things that satan purposes to rob you of you leave here today knowing that's one of the last things i said to you that satan has a playbook with your name on it he's studied you he's watched you he knows where your chinks and your armor are he knows where your weak spots are and we all got him brother branham said what i do about my weak spot brother i said that's where you double up your armor make thicker armor right there do whatever is necessary to get to to shield that weakness from the enemy exploiting it see and these kingdom principles and the kingdom living in our lives and testifying of christ to a world that to be that little streak of light moving through darkness just understand that this satan wakes up every day and goes to bed every night thinking how he can knock you off of that amen you know it's i heard i heard a brother david samuel this morning using an example that was so beautiful he starts talking about how that you get on a train and you're going to go somewhere and you've got all these brochures and looking at all these pictures and all of this marketing and man that's going to be so wonderful when i get there it's going to be it's going to be like a millennium and he said and that's what we've all done remember brother branham used that same analogy said you're standing in he said flashing red light of his coming remember that and he said you you're standing there waiting on the train and he said you know you might walk around and you might get you some peanuts and somebody over here reading a newspaper and you're waiting on that train he said but suddenly he said you hear ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding and lights start flashing he said that train's in the blocks he said i'm going to tell you what you better throw down them peanuts you better get that newspaper put away you better grab your stuff because that train's only stopping briefly it's going to roll in stop all aboard here we go and you're not going to have time if you're running late you're stuck in traffic because you didn't leave early enough and the train's going to leave without you you understand so so it's it's about it's about persistence and sensibility it's about it's about being studious in our lives it's about it's about kingdom principles and and brother david said you know it's like you get on that train to head to this destination now your destination might be who can say we we probably are on all kinds of trains destined maybe maybe you want more purity maybe you want you know maybe you want more a better job maybe you want this maybe you're asking god maybe it's a different church maybe it's a maybe it's a spouse maybe maybe it's you know you're lonely and you where's my where's my divine mate lord and brother david said you know you've got to brochure the promises of god there this is like a brochure for heaven and all these promises man look at these descriptions wow i'm getting on this train and he said so many people fail to get to their destination just for a lack of patience they just get impatient in life and they just get off the train maybe they get off at the second or third stop and they never he said when you do that you're just left with the brochure that's all you've got this is never nothing more than just a brochure to you someplace you'd like to go someday i'm here to tell you something friends get on that train stay on that train it's taking you somewhere don't be impatient this brochure isn't just some this isn't a marketing ploy these are not cunningly devised tales this is the real plan for god he has a plan for you and a plan for me and you're invited you're invited you're invited come one come all you're invited to go to this kingdom this kingdom is going to be right here on the earth that's as far as i can get today friends we've got a baptism let's stand our feet brother matt bring your team back amen amen praise the lord all right we will uh we'll let the deacons go ahead and take brother ron and be getting things ready oh you know what we're you guitar players sorry to say you're gonna have to just yeah you're gonna have to kind of clear everything out of the way amen uh deb if you give me because he lives i can face tomorrow because he lives all fear is gone amen praise the lord let's bow our heads friends while they work on this let's bow our heads father we thank you for your word today i thank you for your anointing to go through it in the way that i was able to lord i purposed in my heart to to just work my way through it methodically to not jump too quickly over any single point [Music] to bring the people the whole word of god for the whole man by a complete god because you're looking to make completed individuals lord in this kingdom you're looking for it in the homes and the families you're looking for husbands to step up you're looking for wives to step into their place you're looking for ministry to be more faithful you're looking for teenagers to be courageous you're looking for your family to make a difference in the world to live in a different way to not be ashamed of the gospel of jesus christ to get out of their own way lord if if i i have found that the easiest way to get out of my own way is to make sure i'm looking in two mirrors there's few things more frustrating to me than when i can't get out of my own way i can't blame you and i can't blame old slew foot i just have to say it's me oh lord it's not my brother no actually it's not my brother that's causing me my problems not my sister causing me my problems it's not my wife it's not my husband it's not the preacher it's not the deacons it's me oh lord the best way to get out of your own way finally at last is to just make sure you stand and look in both mirrors father i'm praying for your mercy on this all congregation today i'm believing that your word lord will have its penetrating effect and as i think over in my heart what's been said and how it was said and the point where i stopped i feel lord uh satisfaction in the holy spirit as far as i know lord as far as i would know i've only delivered the word that you delivered to me master i've had no certain agenda been studying this thought for weeks maybe months and we've been dividing it out a little bit at a time a little bit at a time and father i i just hope that the people will right here at the beginning of this new year we just we just had to communion service we rededicated our hearts to you lord god we came and we had our very first service in the new year and now here we are with our next one and we're going forward and we don't know how many more services we'll have before that great service in the sky along for that one boy oh boy but father i wanna i wanna be faithful here in all my ways i want to be faithful in all my doings and everything i say and i i want to allow the kingdom of god to reign supreme in every facet of my life i just couldn't get away from it lord that just kept echoing every facet every facet of my life there should be a there's a there's a guide for every facet there's a guiding principle there's a guidebook there's a chapter in god's guidebook of life there's a chapter governing that facet of your life no matter how insignificant you think it is no matter how small it might seem or how large there's a guide god

amen matthew thank you god bless you amen praise the lord friends you love the lord this is wonderful brother luther now we're talking about sister bob um uh is is tony's youngest one anaya is that she the youngest one anaya yes what is it yeah that's what i thought so uh she was actually going to come get baptized today as well come on out brother rome let people stare at you for a few minutes um she was gonna get baptized today but sister amber was sick and i actually forgot to put her on the prayer request list her and brother tony both uh feel a little bit under the weather but sister amber wanted to wait so we thought well let's just wait so hey we can't we can't fill this thing up too many times as far as i'm concerned i've baptized somebody every week hey man i was telling brother luther there's a time back in the day i don't know many of you might not remember sister wanda probably does uh sister mom might remember maybe maybe my kids we were baptizing two and three people a week for three months we were down at the river costly two and three at a time our church went from 20 couple people to 75 like that and we were and we were baptizing them right off the streets and uh so uh those that was quite a quite a thing so i i i hey man we want to we want to see more come we know we're just gleaning we get that but you know there might there's obviously a few more out there because we're not gone yet amen praise the lord brother come on down and uh we're gonna put you all the way in your big old fella amen come all the way down don't worry it's bathtub water brother luther looks out for people amen somebody was telling me i forget now so their teeth were chattering because before we started putting oh that's nothing right there wow wow we used to be at the river i've baptized them at the sands i don't know if you know where that is it's a river over here and man we just run the sharks away and wade right out and and so i baptized uh i think it was probably i forget how late at night maybe somewhere up in the morning late at night at baptized brother jesse cold oh my goodness couldn't have been 45 degrees amen praise now that ain't nothing y'all i was on the phone to brother bruce paris and brother bruce just yesterday and he said how how's uh how's it going brother jason i said oh it's wonderful it's a beautiful day i said it's pretty cold it's down to 50 and he just busted out laughing i said oh it's down to 50s and i said yeah and then it dawned on me i'm speaking to a yankee so he was real cold but amen we're we we we love the lord and we're i'm glad for this facility i'm glad that this makes it easy this is a momentous moment for you brother rome amen you know it god follows us our whole life but but eventually time intersects with prophecy and what's happening to you today is that today now you've already had you know we met here in the back office and you committed your whole heart to the lord forever ask the lord to live inside you and you wanted to come today to receive his name publicly in front of all these people and what what's happening is is today with all the other days combined but today god is bringing you a little closer to the image he saw of you before the foundation of the world now you just believe that he has an image before the before there was stardust he has an image of you and today he's bringing you a little closer to that image amen praiseworth the rapture if the rapture happens today you're going to look pretty much same you're only 19 so i'll look a lot different but but uh amen praise the lord have a seat here brother right here no and what we're going to now you sit right near the edge because i don't want to crack your head going back amen yeah you are and uh but hey i i baptized gideon he's taller than you so but um this is true christian baptism see the world got that wrong the the early church used to baptize exactly how we're about to do it they put people under the water because that's the symbolism of death jesus was buried he went down and he rose up so we put people down in symbolism of death and raised them in symbolism of life see and so we do it in the name of the lord jesus christ and the only reason we do it that way is because that's how the disciples did it right we're not we don't try to be harsh to the rest of the world who do it in other ways we just simply say for us we'd rather do it the way the disciples did it and so if people want to follow man-made tradition that's just on them they'll just have to answer to god but god has revealed to you that there is no name under heaven there is no other name given among men under heaven given among men whereby we must be saved other than the name of the lord jesus christ so that's why we baptize the bible says whatsoever you do in word or deed do all in the name of the lord jesus christ amen amen and when peter baptized him he said repent and be baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ and everybody that was ever baptized was baptized in the name of the lord every one of them and that's why we're doing it today now this is a promise ron see um this is a promise that you are meeting this is what baptism is is after repentance this is your first act of obedience you're coming to the water you're saying to the lord i'm starting here and i'm going to go the rest of my life obeying you you get that all right let's pray father we thank you for our brother thank you lord that you watched over his life you guided him to a certain certain friend who met a certain certain friend who met a young woman who knew who knew about you knew about this message and she witnessed she was a faithful witness of it lord now on that day she'll have a jewel in her crown that'll be a brone jewel because she is the one sh this brother will be a jewel in her crown for eternity because she's the one who spread the light first father there was something there was an attraction to to to a life that attracted his heart it was a deep calling to a deep now father he's come in repentance confessing all of his sin he none of us can change our own life lord but we believe you can we he's invited you to come into his heart and live in him forever he's here to take your name in baptism lord may the promise of the spirit be his for the remainder of his life you said i'll i'll go with you to i'll be with you even in you to the end so father we thank you for that today we commit him into your hands in jesus name amen brother on you can cover your nose whatever you want to do i'm just going to lay straight all the way down okay and we're going to take you all the way under and if i don't get you all the way i got to do it again so we're going all the way under all right brother brother ron what's your full name brother lightfoot that's a crazy name lone rhone lightfoot donahue wow that's epic all right brother with joy in our heart we baptize you in true christian baptism in the name of the lord jesus christ all the way under amen praise the lord god bless you brother stand up give the lord glory say amen praise the lord hallelujah amen amen sing
