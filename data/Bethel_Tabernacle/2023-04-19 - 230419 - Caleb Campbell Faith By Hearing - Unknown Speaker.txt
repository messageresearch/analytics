[music] Oh, how I [music and singing] love Jesus. Oh, how I love Jesus. Because [singing] he first loved me. [music] Amen. Amen. Hallelujah. Always happy to be in the house of the Lord tonight. Still just feasting on the word from this weekend. I think we all probably are. So thankful for the moving of the word and so much was said. I could probably just spend all night just going going through it. Um you know, one thing that was said that was some a sister was coming through the prayer line just standing in the gap for a loved one. Brother Andrew said, "This is the time for the prodals to come home." Amen. I believe that with all of my heart. Amen. I believe that the Lord is going to use the faith of his bride to bring them home. Amen. So, I'd like to take a thought on faith tonight. If we could open up in our Bibles Romans, the 10th chapter, Romans 10:17. We'll start there. We have three portions of reading. Just greet the visitors there. And God bless y'all. I took a thought along the same lines last week when I was ministering away, but the Lord kind of had me take a little different avenue with it tonight. No matter what our thoughts are, I just looking for the Lord to be the leader of the service to guide the ship tonight. Amen. Amen. I think um you know every time I go to minister, one of the very first things I pray that the Lord would go into each of your hearts that are going to be here tonight and would discern exactly what you have need of and then lay it on my heart. And it's funny because it seems like I never know exactly which way the Lord wants me to go until the day before. And you know, at first that's really nerve-wracking, but uh now that it's happened just about every time, I can have a little bit of a peace about it. So, amen. Let's go to the word. Romans 10:17. Amen. So, for then faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of God. We're going to go over into Hebrews 11. Hebrews 11. We're going to read the first six verses. Hebrews 11:1-6 says, "Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen. For by it the elders obtained a good report." Through faith, we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God, so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear. By faith Abel offered God unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain, by which he obtained witness that he was righteous, God testifying of his gifts, and by it he being dead yet speaketh. By faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death and was not found, because God had translated him. For before his translation he had the this testimony that he pleased God. But without faith, it is impossible to please him. For he that cometh to God must believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him. Amen. So, one more reading there in the book of Genesis all the way back. Genesis 32. Genesis 32 and we're going to look at six verses there. 32 22- 28. So, we'll start at verse 22. And he rose up that night. Now this is Jacob when he was on his way back to his land. He had, you know, he had that vision from the Lord that you need to go back to your land. So he rose up that night and he took his two wives and his woman servants and his 11 sons and passed over the for Jabbach and he took them and sent them over the brook and he sent over that he had. And Jacob was left alone and there wrestled a man with him until the breaking of the day. And when he saw that he prevailed not against him, he touched the hollow of of his thigh. And the hollow of the Jacob's thigh was out of joint as he wrestled with him. And he said, "Let me go, for the day breakth." And he said, "I will not let thee go except thou bless me." And he said unto him, "What is thy name?" And he said, "Jacob." And he said, "Thy name shall be called no more Jacob, but Israel. For as a prince hast thou power with God and with men, and hast prevailed." So, we see here Jacob fulfilling Hebrews 11:6. Rewarded for diligently seeking him. No matter what his past looked like, no matter what his failures he had, he didn't let any of those things hinder his faith that night. Oh my. Let's just go to the Lord. Heavenly Father, Lord, we just open up your word tonight. Father, we pray that you would have preeminence in the service tonight, Father. Lord, I pray that I can just move out of the way. I pray that, Lord, I can just find the mind of Christ. Lord, I pray that Lord, you would anoint the the speaker, anoint the hearers, Father, to hear your word tonight. Father, we're just all here in one mind, Lord, in one accord, just looking to draw a little bit closer to you. Father, we pray and ask over these things. We pray a blessing over the reading of your word. Lord, I pray that Lord, I wouldn't be confined to my notes. Lord, I pray that you would be the the leader of the service. Father, we ask all these things now in the mighty precious name of Jesus Christ. Amen. I pray the Lord add a blessing to the reading of his word. Take your seats. I'd like by the help of the Lord tonight to minister on faith by hearing. Faith, we know the prophet teaches us, is a six sense, something that rises above our natural ability to see or to feel or to hear something. But it's a belief in something. We know Hebrews 11:1 says that faith is the substance of things hoped for and the evidence of things not seen. So faith actually begins with a hope in something. But when you have faith, it's a step higher. And the word evidence by definition is something that furnishes proof. So faith grabs hold of hope and then makes it a reality. So you know we use the five senses and we're going to get a little deeper into that in a minute to hope for something but we can't stay there because faith is a revelation personally to you. Amen. And faith cometh by hearing and hearing of the word. So you beginning to hope in something you begin to speak it. Words are thought expressed. And when you get into the atmosphere of God, he begins to express his thoughts to you. Philippians 2 says, "Let this mind be in you that was in Christ Jesus." And then those thoughts of God are spoken through his body of believers and then expressed through their life. So the mind of Christ will become in you and then you express the mind of God through that. Amen. It's not the power of positive thinking. The prophet of God says it many times, the right mental attitude towards every promise of God will bring it to pass. So you take a mental conception of the need, healing in your body, salvation of a family member, healing of your mind, whatever it is, and then you continue in it. And because those promises to you are in the word of God, it will absolutely manifest and come to pass because God's word cannot fail. The prophet says that revelation is one of the most vital things that you need to pray for. Not just at one point in your life, but every single day. And faith, like I said, is a revelation to each one of us personally. Brother Benham says here at 1960, the unchangeable God, he says, I can go on record for this tonight. If any people will take the right mental attitude towards any divine promise that God ever made and claim it for yours, he will bring it to pass. If you'll take the right mental attitude towards it, knowing that if God says so, the promise is yours and it's your personal property. The very minute you receive it that way, then it has to come to pass. For Jesus said, "The word is a seed that a swer seed swed." And a seed, if it's germmitized seed, it goes into the ground and then the seed under the right conditions of the sun and the moisture will bring forth the life that's in that seed. So is the so is the word of God. He says, "If a person can take the word and place it in their heart and then give it the right amount of sunshine, the right temperature, not su n," he says, but s o n, the right temperature of faith in there, that seed and promise will live to you just as it did in the beginning to the one that it was given to because it's God's word and he's the same yesterday, to today, and forever. And he cannot fail. His word cannot fail. So, we find those promises in the scripture. We we read them and then we anchor it down in us and we live it. We just continue in it. Right. Amen. Just you just have to find the scripture that you need. Jehovah, Gyra, Abraham needed something to sacrifice. So he spoke the word to his two servants that God will provide for himself a sacrifice and then he just moved forward and then he manifested exactly what was needed. Amen. So here the prophet of God is saying that when you take the word and then you place it in the in your heart, you give it the right sunshine, the right temperature, it comes alive to you personally because why? Because God's word can't fail. And the more that you dive into the word, the more you ask for revelation, the more God's going to reveal to you in your heart and in your life that that promise is actually yours and you are a possessor of that promise. Amen. Amen. There is a two-fold purpose of getting in the right temperature. It brings forth the life of the seed in you and it bakes out all that stuff that it that doesn't need to be there. So we increase our faith by laying in the presence of the sun. Brother Random says that so many times in his last year of ministry by the year of the by by the hearing of the word. It adds the right amount of light on the seed in you and it begins to literally furnish proof of whatever desire you have in your heart as long as it lines up with the word. Amen. And even greater than that, your desires begin to match his desires. Because when you get in into that presence and stay there, you are abiding him. Scripture says that he abides in you. So at whatever stage, whatever stage of walk that you're in tonight, you pray for the revelation of your life. And then that second fold of that, you you manifest that by hearing the word of God. That begins to bake out that old life. And that begins to settle something that revelation because that seed that's placed in you, that germmitized seed that God placed in you from the before the foundation of the world, it begins to grow. And that right amount of light is going to grow. And then all the weeds that are around that thing that God knows that each one of us have, that thing be those things just begin to fall away because you're in the right amount of temperature. Not too much, not too little, just the right amount of temperature. Amen. Faith is a revelation. Brother Brandham says here in Revelation 4, he says, "Now the senses in the body, is that right?" He knows that. How many knows that six senses control the body? We got a soul after you get through this. The senses is outside and that's the outer system. See, see, taste, feel, smell here. And now in here, there's two, three, four, five attributes in the soul. Now, you want to write them down. The first one is imagination. The second is conscious. The third is memory, he says. The fourth is reason. The fifth is affection. Now, did you get them all? He says if you don't then let me let me know. You got them all down. See, taste, feel, smell, hear the body. That's that's the open to the body. So the soul is imagination, conscience, memory, reason, affection is the senses or the attributes like the senses of the soul. And the soul, catch this, the soul is the nature of the spirit that's on the inside. Cuz the does because the soul only puts out an atmosphere of what's on the inside of you. It takes the place of sanctification. The soul sets the same category all right there. Everybody get that down. Now to this gate, there's only one gate. That's called self-will. You're the boss of what goes in there. And what does it do? What is this? The body must be washed, the lav sanctified here, filled with the Holy Spirit. And this becomes God's judgment seat again where God sits in your heart and if you do something wrong, you say, "Oh my, I did something wrong." See, so when your nature is changed and you're filled with the spirit of God, you can still do wrong. That's in our nature. That's just the flesh outer man that we take. But the difference is that you get so convicted of it that you're you have that sanctification living on the inside of you. So then you say, "Oh God, I did something wrong. Lord, forgive me of it." And that's the first thing that you have in your heart. Nothing else matters until you make that thing right with God because your nature is literally changed. It is a strange thing. Brother Random says looking at the unseen 1958 says it is a strange thing that man who was made in the image and the likeness of God and was called of him to walk by faith believing that God is would choose to walk by sight instead of by faith after his makeup his being. All that dwells in him was fashioned in the likeness of God. And God is that great Jehovah who calls those things which were not as though they were. And man made to live with God in this manner. Yet has he chosen to walk by his sight. He says he wants to be our own. He wants to be his own boss. That's just in our nature. He wants no one to tell him what to do. That's just the nature of man. It proved to be thus in the garden of Eden when he lost his fellowship with God by choosing to go his own way, not having rule over him. But a man is made like a sheep and a sheep cannot find his way. It he says, I'm told. When it's lost, it's totally lost. And that's the way with man. When he's lost, he's absolutely helpless. He must have a shepherd to guide him. And man, when he chooses, as the day goes on, we find man continually getting worse, choosing rather to walk by sight than instead of by faith, by the unseen. And when he does that, listen, he when he does that, he robs the inner man, which is the soul. And that's the eternal part of man. Each one of us has an eternal part. So, you're robbing that eternal part. He says, 'Now man shall not live by bread alone, said the Lord, but by every word that proceeded out out of the ma mouth of God. So that part of you that's calling out that you did something wrong, that's calling out that you want to live a more holy life, that that eternal part calling out saying come home, that your inner man, our biggest enemy, I hate giving credit to the devil. I sure hate it. I don't like to give him credit for anything. Our biggest enemy is not the devil. It is not the devil at all. It is ourselves. I I just hate giving him the credit. It's your flesh man that gets in the way so much of the time. It's the inner man that's always waring with your carnal nature. Paul teaches us about that. He says that I do the things that I desperately don't want to do and I don't do the things that my very inner man wants to do. And I just said, man, when he when I read that, I'm just like that is me living there right there. I I I don't do the things that I desperately my inner man desperately wants to do. But then those things that I don't want to do that my but my outer man somehow gets control of it. Those are the things that I end up doing. And why is that? It's because that nature is living. It's still living right right beside you trying to have control of you. What happens? It's your fallen nature. It's fighting with you even after you're born again of the spirit of God. Amen. We literally rob ourselves when we start walking by sight. Wow. We we walk out of the plan of God and then we find ourselves on the basis of reasoning. What happens in our minds when we hear the word of God spoken? Maybe it's in correction. Then we don't stay with it. We do exactly what Abraham did there with AMC. We start walking by sight. We inject our own plan into God's plan because why? Because of that fallen nature. He told Sarah to lie and say that she was his sister. And then when she would then when he's confronted with it, he tries to justify his actions and say, 'Well, you know, she really is my sister, but she's just my halfsister that I'm that I'm married to. Don't we always try to justify our actions and try to find a way around whatever we did wrong? Absolutely. You know, we heard the word preached at the revival the revival meetings this weekend and something deep laid down deep within us is screaming amen to every word. Right. Glory to God. That's nothing but the truth. But then we leave Monday and then we have the pressures of life and then we we're not under that inspiration anymore. Then we leave and and and the conviction that you had your on your heart somehow, you know, we start to reason it away. And what is it? It's not it's not that inner man reasoning it away. It's that outer man, that outer flesh, it's that enemy that's trying to reason that thing away from you. Whatever conviction that you had, whatever thing that you had laid on your heart, it's trying to reason it all away. Whatever victory you had, it's trying to reason it away. But you stand on that promise of God. whatever you had, whatever experience, and you stay right with it, just like Jacob stayed with it. He wrestled with it until he possessed it. Hallelujah. Glory to God. What happens? The sun, the sen was baking that besetting sin out of your life. You were in the right amount of temperature and it was it was watering that seed in you. You know, we start to we start to justify like we were saying, it's not necessarily maybe a sinful thing that I'm doing. You know, there isn't any scripture that perfectly states that there. Maybe there's not a direct quote against it. Yet, you had that conviction laid in your heart. And what was it? That was the Holy Ghost trying to bake that thing out of you. He was reminding you of your position. If he places conviction on you for something, and it may not even seem like anything, he knows what he's doing. He knows your ins and he knows your outs. He knows your ups and he knows your downs. He knows all about you. So, he has something. He has he has he has an eagle-eyed view to know that whatever it was maybe isn't affecting you now, but later down the road it may be affecting you. Maybe it won't ever affect you, but maybe somebody's watching your life and it'll affect them. So, we have to be because we we're written epistles read of all men. So, we have to be sanctified. We have to be cleansed always washed by the water of the word. Amen. And you know, when the Holy Spirit does convict you, you know it's because Jesus loves us more than anything. Right? You know, when we we correct our kids, you know, it's to teach them. You know, my one-year-old, she doesn't know better than to run into the street. So, it's my responsibility to train her not to do that kind of a thing, to correct her, because why? Because if I don't correct her when there's no cars in the street and I'm not around one day or or you know, some something happens and she doesn't know to run, you know, we can't really teach her that yet because she's only one, but you know, when she does to get to that point, she'll run out in there and she could die. God sees every part of our life. He sees exactly what's going to happen at every single turn. So he knows that maybe you know 5 years down the road that little besetting weight or that little seed that you're that you're not going to squash in your life it becomes a it becomes a tree and then that tree grows fruit and then that fruit falls off that tree and then there's more seeds and then there's more seeds and before you know it you don't even realize that now you're in this entire forest of this besetting sin that was just a seed at one time in your life. The Lord is calling us higher than that, saints. He has a vision of you as a finished product. When he when he came there in Hebrews in the 11th chapter, it says Abraham staggered not at the promise of God because he had a vision of the finished product of him. He sees the finished product of you. It doesn't matter what you what what what your past looks like. It doesn't matter what sin it was in your life. It doesn't matter. God sees the finished product of you. You come there and Joseph and his brothers and you you look at this story and you think, man, you know, Judah, the line of the tribe of Judah is what the lineage of Jesus came from. You know, Judah in the Bible was the one who who had the idea, let's betray, let's bet let's let's let's send him off into into slavery. You have all these brothers and then years down the road they get in this place in their lives and and they thought that their sin had caught up with them and and their sin they thought it was going to find them and Joseph me and me and my wife were just reading it the other night and Joseph comes there they don't they don't know it's Joseph yet and they're speaking in their tongue and he has an interpreter so he doesn't they don't know that he knows what they're talking about and he said remember when we sold our brother this is the sin this is what's going to take place and and but what What happened was is Joseph at that time was going to extend a hand of grace in there. God is always willing to extend a hand of grace. Joseph is a perfect type of Christ. Always willing to extend a hand of grace while we're still here before the rapture comes. There is a there is a hand of grace in your life that he's extending. He's extending that olive branch TO SAY COME BACK. you know, you may be, you know, uh, 10 steps in the wrong direction, but just take one little step back in the right direction and we're going to you're going to find your way back home. And then you get you get later on in that scripture and that story and you look at, you know, what do you think that they went through all those years of that besetting sin and then when it caught up to them and they realized, my goodness, you know, we sold our brother and and they thought he had died and now they come to this point where it was time to go and tell their father what had happened. And they get to this point and they realize there there isn't even I couldn't find any scriptures where where they were scared to tell their dad the what had taken place. They they were scared to say that we that we that we sold our brother into Egypt. All they were so excited that their younger brother wasn't going to die. They said Joseph is alive and and there was just there was such a miraculous time. to whatever happened in your life, whatever happened in your past, even a besetting thing that you maybe feel ashamed of or whatever the case is. God doesn't care about the past cuz somehow he always takes broken things and he makes them beautiful. He always can take the crooked path he says there and then he makes it straight somehow. God I hate to like I said earlier I hate giving the devil credit for everything though God has a plan. So before the foundation of the world and this is not to dis discredit sin in our lives but before the foundation of the world he knew each mistake he was going to each mistake that we were going to make. So then he crafted a plan that this was going to come out of this mistake somehow someway you he was going to take that mistake and he was going to make something beautiful out of it. I DON'T KNOW HOW GOD IS the orchestrator of it all. But all he needs, all he needs is a surrendered HEART TO SAY, "OH GOD, LORD, I'm Lord, forgive me of whatever it is that I did. Lord, get me on that that straight path. Take away all that crooked things in my life and just get me on that straight path." Then he takes care of the rest. Oh, he makes the the the the He makes the the gate beautiful again. Glory to God. I I I did a men's breakfast a few months ago and the thought that the Lord had placed on my heart was in the bosom of God. You know, I took that thought there from John 13 where John was laying there right on the bosom of Jesus right after Jesus prophesies of his betrayal and he starts he starts asking him the question Lord he says Jesus is it I is it I Lord is it I that's that's betraying you my it should always be at the forefront of our hearts to ask that kind of a question to the Lord is there something in me that's betraying the confidence that you have Lord God is there something. Is there some maybe besetting thing that maybe maybe it doesn't look like it's that big of a deal? Or maybe we reasoned it away. Maybe, you know, you know, maybe we we started comparing ourselves to the world and maybe it didn't look like it was so bad because, you know, we're way much better way better off looking, you know, than than the world at this point. But we don't compare ourselves to the world, saints of God. We compare ourselves to the word of God. We compare ourselves to what God has ordained for us in our life. Amen. Like the prophet said there in in uh that first quote I read, paragraph 20 2:22 in Revelation chapter chapter 4, my is it is is it something laid in me that betrays your word? Is there some hindrance that's keeping me from moving forward in you? You know, I believe that really truly is everyone's heart's desires tonight. Just draw closer to the Lord and to be more like him in every way. To change our hearts, to change our desires, right? You know, but often time the biggest and I was saying this, the biggest and the most exponential thing that you can do for the Lord is actually remove all the hindrances in your own life. You know, you maybe you want to you you want to speak to that mountain, but maybe you have a speck in your life that God needs to get rid of first before you can speak to that mountain. God has God has things orchestrated perfectly to make you perfect. He He has made herself ready. And brother Brandon, we're going to get to this quote later, but Brother Brandon will say that she has the materials here on earth to make herself ready. What is those materials? It's the word. It's the message of the hour to us today to wash us by a clean word, not some kind of formal go to church and we'll just say we went to church and you know that's it. It's it's living by every word that God had has told us to live by. Yes, sir. That's right. Brother Random says here in the contest 1962, now the enemy is going to study our strategy with the word. Satan studied all that out so perfectly till when he came to Eve, the best strategy that he could use with her was that to reason with the word. Now, you never want to reason with God's word. Amen. You just believe it. Don't try to explain it. Don't try to figure it out. You cannot figure out God. God is the word and it's just made to believe. That's our strength is just accept the word. And anyone knows that a seed in the right kind of ground will produce its kind. So we take the word and then we produce the word. Amen. Satan's cunning. He's deceptive. And he studies our strategy with the word just like he did did Eve. And that's why we don't take we don't take anything from the word. We don't add anything. We don't subtract anything. We just we do exactly what he said to do. We say exactly what he said to say. Amen. the, you know, the enemy, he's always trying to attempt, he's always attempting to destroy the word of God in your life. He's always trying to belittle your experience. He's trying to explain away your healing. Maybe you had a victory this weekend in those revival services. Maybe something happened, but he's trying to take that away from you. You keep that victory. You take it because it really is your victory. Amen. He'll reason it away somehow. But our job isn't to figure out something. It's not to It's not to carve out some kind of our own plan like Abraham did. It's just to take him at his word and just to strive forward with it. Amen. The Lord might place conviction, but then we reason it away. Paul says there, we have a scripture for that. Paul says there, "All things are lawful for me, but all things are not expedient." So whatever it is maybe he placed on your heart, it's actually him answering your prayer. Because when we we pray the Lord, Lord, I want to draw closer to you. his answer back. Well, maybe that thing in your life isn't it's not technically unlawful, but it's really it's not expedient to your walk. It's it's it's kind of going to become a besetting thing. You know, it's it's really it's hindering your walk with me. And so, I kind of want you to get rid of it. And the Lord is a gentleman, so he's just going to place it. And then we have to with our own self-will, we have to accept that and we have to move forward into it. Amen. Oh, and just John just laying there on the bosoms asking, "Is it I, Lord? Is there anything laid in me? All those disciples, is there anything in me?" Look at the approach. Just such reverence, such respect. You know, they weren't sure who was going to be the one that said, you know, was going to be betrayed them. But their hearts went out for him. Amen. They had such a care and such a love for him. They didn't they didn't want it to be them. Their hearts, their desires was with God. Is that your desire tonight? Is your heart is your desire to say, "Is there something in me that betrays you, Lord? Is there something in me that shouldn't be there? Is there something in me that trespasses your confidence? I'll make it right, Lord, whatever it takes because I value your word. I value everything that you had to say." Often times, I think we can even trespass his confidence without even fully realizing it. If we can begin in the state of humility and actually seek after correction until there's nothing left to correct, Lord, is there something in me that grieves your Holy Spirit, anything unholy? Ephesians 4 says, "Grieve not the Holy Spirit by which we're sealed by until the day of redemption." And that's the attitude we can keep and the approach we can take. That's where he wants to take us. Such a place of confidence in his word. Amen. Brother Brandham says there in perfect faith, he says, "When we were sinners, alienated without God in the world in that muck of mud, as I talked about this morning, God came to us. God sought you, you never sought God. No man can come to me except the father draws him first. And God came down to me in that muck, what you were, and sought you, and then he brought you out of it." That ought to create a perfect love. He says, "Look what you was, now look what you are." Hallelujah. What did that something that loves you? Somebody that loves you. Can't you have faith in what he promised you? Then a real genuine love will create a confidence in his word. Hallelujah. He caught me when I was nothing and I'm still nothing. He says, "But now I'm in his hand." Hallelujah. He caught me. He loved me when I was unlovable. He loved you when you was unlovable. But he changed you. Just like that colored sister said that time in her testimony, she said, "I'm not what I ought to be. I'm not what I want to be. But man, I'm sure not what I used to be. Man, I'm so glad for that. He says, "If God, when I was an alien, loved me so much till he stooped down to get me and pick me up. That gives me confidence." Now, listen here. That gives me confidence that he wants to use me. That gives me confidence that he wants to use each one of us here tonight. He's got a purpose in doing it. He's seen something in you. He's seen something in you. He says he had a reason to save you. Look at the people that's unsaved today. Look at the millions he could have took beside you, but he took you. He took you. Amen. And no one can take your place. It says, it says you are in God's, he says, you're in God's economy. No one can do it. That's his love to you. You are in God's economy. What a promise of the word. No matter what the situation or, you know, the circumstance, he says it's governed by the love that creates faith. So that love of God's word creates faith because faith cometh by hearing and when you hear the word of God then he can bake out those things and then bring that seed to life. Amen. Amen. Amen. That quote is just so encouraging for me. I He's He's seen something in you. Yes, sir. And you know when we realize that he's seen something in you to overcome in the last days, he's seen something that you are going to overcome by the blood of the lamb and by the word of your testimony. And when we realize that, it should give us such a determination to get so hidden in Christ Jesus. Not to say it or not to just, you know, preach it, but to really live it. Amen. means coming to a place in our lives in Jesus where Jesus he's really is truly first and foremost in every avenue. A place where we have such confidence in his word that his commandments and following everything he said do means more to you than anything. A place where this message, the message of the hour means more to you than anything because it's a word through a prophet given given to us to perfect us. Because God in his infinite wisdom and mercy gave us a word to take us home. And then he placed you here in this day because he had confidence that you were going to overcome by the word by the blood of the lamb and by the word of your testimony. Amen. Glory to God in his infinite wisdom. I heard a brother say Tim brother Tim Doy said this at at a at the men's meeting a couple years ago. He says you know we try to quantify God. You know we Abraham sat there you know in 25 years you know and and if and this clock he used if you look at a clock on a year a thousand years is like a year for the Lord or is like a day for the Lord I think. So he says if you look at a clock that really only took God six minutes to do that thing in Abraham's life. We try to quantify the things in our life because all we are we're we're simple. We're human beings and we have our trials we face our tests. We have these things that we go through and we try to quantify things. But God is an infinite God. He doesn't have quantity like we do. He has everything. He knows everything. He is everything. So if we place our faith in that and have a substance of that, it will furnish the proof in your life. And it will come by hearing hearing of the word accepting that word in your life and then moving forward in that word. Amen. Wow. You you hear quotes. You you hear the word being preached like this weekend and you know it's the opposite of what the world would say. It's it's not popular what was preached this weekend. But something deep down in me just says amen. It just makes me want to shout. Something deep down just says hallelujah. What is that? That's the right temperature getting on that seed in your life saying amen to every word of God. Hallelujah. Glory. Hallelujah. What a what a humble heart it has to take to ask that question, Lord, is it I? And then really mean it, you know, because he's always faithful and he's always going to do what what he says he's going to do. And just to answer your prayer, you know, my son, my yes, my son, yes, my daughter, here it is. You know, you're living this way. You're doing this thing. Yet, I've called you to higher places than that, to deeper depths. Now, listen, we all mess up. None of us here tonight or across the internet ways are are immune from mistakes. We all make mistakes even after we're born again of the spirit of God. All he wants us to become is more humble and have confidence in his word. And then he can take the testimony of whatever he brought you from and he can shake the gates of hell with it. Glory to God. He can add the right amount of water from the word and cause it cause that seed to grow just a little bit more. speaking on faith tonight. See, he's got confidence in us. Amen. Whatever it is, how hard it may be, how ridiculous it sounds, he wants us to have such confidence in him that he knows best. You know, and that's living a truly surrendered life in Christ. And you know, when a preacher says that to live a surrendered life, it's not a cliche term. It's not a far-reaching impossibility. It's as simple as putting yourself in the presence of the sen and then obeying every part of the word of God and then moving forward. That's as simple as a full surrender is. You you say amen to the word and then you apply it to your life and then faith by hearing will then grow that seed. It'll bake away all those things that don't need to be there and then you'll grow into your perfection one day. That's all it takes. Hallelujah. Very good. It's [clears throat] It's going to happen when you fall. But I just want to encourage you tonight. Don't stay down. Stand up and keep on walking. Subject your mind to feed on the things of the word. Feed those senses with the right thing. Yes. Because faith cometh by hearing and hearing the word of God. You stay right with that. That presence when you pray or when you praise or when you get into that atmosphere. Brother Benham says it says it brings you into a different atmosphere. It brings all your flaws to the surface. It brings you to repentance. And then when you are empty or you make the choice with your free will to break away from that or break away from a besetting sin in your life, then he can put more light on that seed because maybe there's just there's 75% that he can get, but there's still a little bit that he needs. He needs to get full light on that seed. He wants all of it gone. He wants to break us from our own will. Prophet God said there at the quote in the beginning, there's only one gate and that's called self-will because he gave us free moral agency to choose. We have to subject ourselves to that actual surrender. So he can have first place. His will is always first and foremost. Amen. Amen. He knows best. I love this quote in perseverance. Brother Bham says, "You've had things to happen. You just knew it was going to be. You didn't know what it was going to be, but it was going to be. That's faith. That's real faith. It's going to happen. Then when you when you know that it's going to be. Now, faith finds a source that others don't see. Amen. Wow. His word is a sword. The Bible said so in Hebrews 4:12 that it is a sword. And it takes an arm of faith to yield to wield that sword. Only faith can do it to hold that sword. Amen. Now, brother Brandham here, he's about to make a reference into that story in there in Matthew uh referring to the woman who had the demon-possessed child. Well, she was a gentile. She came to Jesus and um Matthew um she came out and she worshiped him crying and said, "Lord, help me." But he said, "It is not meat to take the children's bread and to cast it to dogs." She said, "Truth, Lord, yet the dogs eat the crumbs that fall from their master's table." Then Jesus answered, said unto her, "Oh woman, great is thy faith. Be it unto thee, even as thou wilt." and her daughter was made whole from that hour. That was a scripture. And the prophet says she had many hindrances. This little woman, she had a daughter that was having epilepsy. She was very, very bad. She had heard that Jesus healed epilepsy. And he says, "Now faith cometh by hearing, and that was her child. So she was determined to get down somewhere and to hear Jesus." Now, she had many hindrances, just many hindrances. But her faith didn't have no hindrances. Tonight people has a lot of hindrances. He says your mind has a lot of hindrances but your faith there is nothing that can stand in its way because faith knows no hindrances. Amen. And this woman heard that there was something that could be done for her sick daughter demonpossessed. The scripture says she wasn't going to let that little discouragement get in her way. She had the right mental attitude towards the word. She accepted what he said. She humbled herself in his presence. And then her faith was not stopped. She had a determination to stay with it because there was a life on the line. There are lives on the line in your life. There are lives on the line in your life that are counting on you to stick with the word. Think about that, friends. There are there are people in your life that are counting on you to stick with the word because your faith is going to be what brings them into their change. Your faith because God works through his body. So he places that faith within us. So then that takes all of the credit away from us. But he uses his body here on earth to manifest things. So your testimony of what you do, where you go, how you act is going to prove to other people that this can be done here in the last age. This can be done. So you stay right with that word and you just keep moving forward. No how no matter how hard it is or no how how much reasoning comes into play, you stay right with the word because people are counting on us. People are counting on you and your testimony to lead them into what God needs them to be because God will use you. He's just waiting for a willing vessel to use. God will use whatever willing vessel is willing to lay down their own will and then allow his will to be what is first place in their life. Amen. Glory to God. Hallelujah. You see, the Lord orchestrates things something sometimes just so beautifully to allow you to go through a certain circumstance just so that you have come to a place of unwavering faith and unwavering perseverance because faith knows no hindrances. So he drives you to a place where he can activate that faith that he put in you. Wow. So then that just takes that takes me out of the picture. Praise God. All I got to do is lift my hands and say, "Blessed be the name of the Lord." Glory to God. He drives you to a place that he can activate it. Glory to God. Let it be known and established in your hearts that when you pray the prayer of faith and you desire to draw closer to him, his way of doing that will of doing that thing is divine and it's perfect and he knows what's best. And sometime that divine will is a trial. Sometimes m maybe he wants to take you through something so other people can see that you that this can be done. Maybe it's a testimony. Whatever the case is, it's could be a trial. And if the devil if the devil never attacked us that would give me some red flags in my life that maybe maybe I'm just living a carnal life because the devil's not really worried about me. The devil's not I want to be on the devil's radar. I don't care what he what I have to go through for that. I want to be on the devil's radar to know that my life IS GOING TO CRUSH HIS SOUL one day. He doesn't have a soul. He's going to crush his head one day. Glory to God. Amen. Victory Day 1963. When you have a trial or a test, it shows the grace of God has found you and you found favor with God and God believes that you'll stand the test. Hallelujah. Glory to God. I'm going to read that one more time. When you have a trial or a test, it shows the grace of God has found you. You found favor with God. And God believes that you'll stand that test. Hallelujah. How secure can you be when the seas are troubled, when they're when they're not troubled, just don't make a bit of difference. He says, "As long as you know that he's laying right there, what difference does it make? Let come. Whatever. Let come. Let go. What may whatever it doesn't make a bit of difference?" Says, "Bless the Lord. Doctor says you're going to die with cancer." Just say, "GLORY TO GOD. Quick trip home." Maybe, see, they don't mind. Talking a group of doctors. He said, "I read your book." And he's, brother Bam's telling the story, you know, he he he was talking to this group of doctors and he and he read his book on divine healing. Brother Bam says, "I guess he criticized it, huh?" He said, "No, sir. I actually admit that you're right." I said, "Well, thank you, Dr. Shoen." He said, he said, "Brother Bam, we have record that when we tell a person that's got a malignancy or something that's going to kill them, an ulcer, ready to burst or tubercular, it depends on what attitude that they take, if they get all tore up, said they die right away." but said if they take that attitude well dying is just part of living it's all right when I die said you know it almost retards the case it almost just negates the case he says I just thought if that mental I just brother says if I just thought if that mental attitude taken like that what will it do when the Holy Spirit strikes that inner man glory to God he says certainly that's right if you can move into a spot into one of the one of the best surgeons and doctors there in the Southland he says if Mr. Brandom I can be proved a man if a man will move can move into a spot until even his own mind don't even know what he's got to think that he's got it and don't even pay attention to it said it wouldn't do it if he can't believe it that's true listen the right mental attitudes towards it will bring now the mind won't do it now listen the mind isn't going to do it but if you give that man that attitude towards something that has got LIFE IN IT OH THEN THAT LIFE comes down and that life does it hallelujah not your mental attitude all that only brings you into the presence of him. Then he does it. That's what you do your mind. The five senses is all right as long as they don't deny God. But when they go to denying God, then you leave them alone. God controls them. That's the creator. Glory to God. It's not your mental attitude that's going to do it. It can start with that mental attitude, but that just brings you into the presence of God and then he's the one that's going to do it. Glory to God. Amen. Thank you. Oh, praise the name of the Lord. He says in the God of this evil age, is this all right tonight, friends? Hallelujah. He says in the God of this evil age, but inside of that spirit is a soul and it's controlled by one thing. That's your free will. You can accept what the devil says or you can accept what God says. And that determines what spirit is in there. If it's the spirit of God, it will feed on the things of God. And it won't feed on anything. Um, this is just my comment. Can we say it together? Anything. Anything. It won't feed on anything of the world. Hallelujah. Jesus said, "If you love the world or the things of the world, it's because the love of God has not even entered into this inner part of you. Satan has deceived you, and man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word out of the mouth of God." Building to something here, but it's controlled by your free will. Amen. The devil's always going to try to complicate things. He's going to try to reason things down, say, "Well, you know, expect the best, but prepare for the worst." That's not faith. That's human reasoning. That's the devil's reasoning. Faith finds a source that others don't see. Hallelujah. How do you get there? How do you find that source? By hearing the word of God. By feeding your five senses with something that will feed that spiritual six sense. And then it'll press play. You go to church. You do those things. And then it takes you and it activates your faith that's laid within you. It it presents that that seed and it starts to grow and it starts to bake out those things. And then it manifests the word in your life. It will literally manifest the word in your life. Hallelujah. Wow. Hallelujah. Glory. We start honoring God in every avenue of our everyday life. Don't let God be in most places. Don't let him be in, you know, [snorts] some of the rooms in your heart. Let him have everything. Hallelujah. Let him be the savior of your life and the lord of your life. Submit it to him. And brother Random says here referring in the church age book referring to Ephesians 3:16. Now according to these verses, when a man experiences the depth of God in his life, it is an actual personal experience of the spirit of God indwelling him and his mind is illuminated by the wisdom and the knowledge of God through the word. But the depth of Satan will always be in that. He will attempt to destroy this. He will always attempt to make a substitute for the reality of God. How will he do that? He will take away the knowledge of the truth of God. Destroy the word by put putting forth his own word. And brother Brandham says in here in quotes, "Yay hath God said?" And remember when brother Jason um brought that out there in Genesis where the serpent deceived Eve in Genesis because he took away the lordship of God. It started with Lord God. And then the serpent took away one word, added a little reasoning, added a little discouragement, added a little worldliness to something, just enough to where it actually looked all right because it's still God. It looked all right. It appeared as if nothing was wrong, but it was Satan destroying the word of God in her life. Amen. It was Satan trying to take away your victory. It was Satan trying to discourage you from living right. It was Satan trying to attempting to destroy the depth of God in our lives. My goodness, he will. He is going and he will always try his very best to do that. Yeah. That's why we take this message that's that the Lord gave us and we say amen to every word. Hallelujah. The enemy is attempting to destroy the life the the word of God in your life. He'll try to do those things. He'll try to take away your healing by reasoning out those things just like he'll try to have you justify your actions just like he did Abraham. Well, what I'm doing isn't wrong or maybe there's no scripture against it. Yet, you stand there convicted in your heart of that thing. He's trying to steal away your victory. That's right. The devil does not care if you have a mental understanding of Jesus or who Jesus is or take some worldly view of accepting him. He fears the life behind the name. Amen. There is a certain amount of overcoming that we're taught in the scripture to possess. He that overcomemeth. So there is something that we do have to do on our end. And brother brother Jason shared this quote with the brothers one day and he says now there's going to be a bride. There's going to be a wedding supper served in the skies here in the marriage of the lamb 1962 paragraph 53. He says now just as sure to be as God is because it's his word. And we know that those things are going to make up that bride is going to be his church. And they're going to appear with him before him without spot or wrinkle. They have, listen, they have the material on earth now to make themselves ready. The message. Hallelujah. The Holy Spirit. Amen. If you notice, she has made herself ready. So, [snorts] so many says, "If the Lord will take this evil spirit from me or drinking or gambling or lying or stealing, I'll serve him." But that's up to you. See, you got something, too. They that overcome shall inherit all things. She has made herself ready. You have power to do it, but you must be willing to lay it down. See, you see, God could not push us through a little pipe, pull us out the other end, and then say, "Blessed is he that overcomemeth." You had nothing to overcome. He just pushed you through. But you've got decisions for yourself. I have to make decisions for myself in doing that. That's how Brother Brandham says we show our faith and respect to God. Amen. Oh my. Our respects to God. Thanks be to God. It shows me that the Lord loves me when I'm going through something. That's contrary to what you would think it would be, but it shows me that I that the Lord loves me because he places something in my life that he wants that he wants to show his word to me. He let us glory in those trials. He says they're so precious to me. So when he blesses me with a trial, oh my, it's really hard to look at a trial like that sometimes. But it gives us an opportunity to show our respects to God. Hallelujah. We do have something to do on our end. How do we overcome? Is it just some giant fancy words or maybe I maybe I could compile a list of all the the best quotes and then you just start saying those quotes over and over and over again and then you just hope that it happens. No, we have we have a we start with that mental conception and then we have faith by hearing and by hearing of the word of God. We plant that. We know that seed's already been planted. So then we allow it to grow in our lives and then it manifests the word in your life. It's not some great hope that hopefully nothing bad is ever going to happen. He overcame it by how? How did Jesus overcome Satan in the scriptures? He overcame it by the word. It is written. Hallelujah. What else is written? I am the Lord that health all die the diseases that will keep Isaiah 26:3, a perfect peace. Uh Jehovah Gyra, I'm your provider. All of these things are your promises in the Bible that manifest to you when you hear the word of God. You apply it to your life and then you move forward in it. Hallelujah. Perfect peace is a place that knowing that I've already overcome it because he's living in me. And in Revelation 11:17 and 18, he already overcame hell and death and the grave. And he has the keys to it. Hallelujah. Glory to God. In me, you might have peace. I have overcome the world. He says, hallelujah. You overcome by the blood of the lamb that's already been shed and then by the word of your testimony. Hallelujah. Yeah. Even if [snorts] every appointment you go to the doctors seemed like they think that it's getting just getting worse and worse and they want you to just keep coming back and back, it does not matter because the word of my testimony is that it is already done. That little baby is already healed and I'm standing on that promise. That's all there is to it. Hallelujah. Don't fret, little child. We walk by faith, not by sight. And faith finds a source that others don't see. Oh my. This quote has meant so much to me lately. Brother Donnie, I may have even quoted it here. Remember, when God counted you worthy to have a test, don't fail to get this. When you have a test or a trial, it shows the grace of God has found you. And God believes that you're going to stay in that test. Hallelujah. He did the very same thing by Job. Hallelujah. God says he's in your hands, but you don't take his life. See, God had confidence in Job. Amen. Oh, my precious wife, she sent me this text last night, and it just it meant so much to me. Oh, she said she was driving home. We had a doctor's appointment on Monday, and most of you know the situation. And you know, we stand on faith, but it does not mean that the discouragements don't come. The discouragements are going to come. The mind battles are going to come, right? That happens. And she said she was driving home from her par from my parents and she was just really feeling down and discouraged and she was listening a victory day and she sent me this. Oh, it means so much. When when it looks like everything is God gone, God is giving you a trial. He's got confidence in you. He doesn't have to baby you around. You're not a hotbed plant, a hybrid. You are a real Christian. Hallelujah. God is giving you a test to see what you'll do about it. Amen. No matter Peter said these fiery trials, why we count it as joy? It's more precious than gold. How many times we him and haw well what if that or what if something gave you to overcome? He just knows he put his trust in you. Hallelujah. He put his trust in you. Glory to God. Faith cometh by hearing. He placed you as a member of the bride of Jesus Christ. So, you know, when the doctor tells me that my unborn child has a hole in her heart, tests positive for a condition that's going to kill her. I stand as an overcomer and it's just the Lord saying, "You watch this. I put my confidence in my children. What about the mind battles that come with it? What about the playing? They're going to happen. It doesn't matter. He's got my word." That's all he needs, brother. Brother Donnie did that wonderful demonstration of just thinking about what's standing over the banisher of time. He's got my word and he's going to stand on it. You just watch, devil. You just watch whatever you're going through in your life, you just stand on it because God's got this. He's going to take control of whatever situation, whatever mind battle, whatever victory that you did have maybe this weekend or maybe maybe even tonight. Whatever victory that you have, you have got that victory. It is already yours. You already possess it. You just keep moving forward in it. You believe it. You hear the word of God. You put your faith in that and then you stand with it. Hallelujah. Glory to God. My victory day. Go listen to victory day when you get a chance. Hallelujah. My victory day is God's confidence in us. Glory to God. When you come in, when the when the devil comes in like a flood, the spirit of the Lord will rise a standard against him. Amen. No weapon formed against me shall prosper. Glory to God. That's our victory day, saints. Grab a hold of it. Keep with it. He says here it seems like the Christian life if the fellow is not absolutely centered on Christ. Now that's the most important thing. You got to be absolutely centered on Christ. It seems like he holds so many disappointments. But but those disappointments are God's divine will happening for us. So now it don't even seem like it would be that. But it's God's way of doing things. He lets us hit the river to see what we'll do. Oh, glory to God. when you hit the river. What courage that ought to be for a sick person. What courage that ought to be for a backslider. He says to stay in the line of duty to turn yourself around to start back to start back. It's God business to open up the Red Seas. It's God's business. You just speak and you move forward. That's all you have to do. Glory to God. You stay in the line of duty. Hallelujah. Faith cometh by hearing. God lets disappointments happen to show victory. Oh, if we could only see that you see these things that seem so blurring, so burring to you and upsetting you. They're trials. They're things that stand still. Focus your glasses on the word of God. Speak the word and move forward. That's all there is to do it. Glory to God. How do you have how do you grab hold of that determined faith? How do you how do you possess it, Caleb? You're talking about victory and you're talking about faith and cometh by hearing and then faith is a substance. How do you how do you take that thing and you grab hold of it? Brother says in the main thing Jacob he had dreams and visions and so forth but this is one time he could lay his hand on something and say that this is God and he was able to hold on to it onto it until the blessing comes. Oh, if we could just do that we could find a spot where where we could see God whether it's in his word whatever it is recognize it's God and hold on to it until the blessing comes. You wrestle it out with God. God promised to do it. God said, "If we'd seek, we'd find, ask, it will be given. Knock, it'll open. Every word is true." When Jacob got a hold of something that he could look at to hold with his hands, when he seen that it was God, he would not turn it loose. Oh, if Christian said in the unchangeable God 1960, oh, if Christian could do that, lay your hold of something that's real. Catch a vision of God and see his presence. Hold on to it until God answers black back and that blessing. What a revival would break out here in Tulsa. He said, "What a revival would break out here in Bethl Tabernacle if we could take a hold of that promise. You hold on to it. You stick with it. No matter what form it comes in, we have our ideas, but God has a way of sending things to us and answering our prayers every time." You remember there in in Daniel 10 when Daniel prayed and the vision broke forth. He says, "Daniel, I heard you from the very first day that you began praying 21 days ago, but I had to battle with the enemy to come and make my way here. But rest assured, everything is going to be okay. Everything is in control." Oh, rest, little bride. It's all in control. I've got it all. I've already overcome it. Just rest. Just Just stay right with the word. Just stay right with your faith. Just just keep hearing my word. Just keep saying amen to all of it. You just stay with it. Whatever it is, whatever situation, whatever, it does not matter. Whatever he decides for my life, he's sovereign. So, he's going to decide it because he's sovereign. He knows best. So, I'm just going to accept it and move forward for it. Amen. Rest assured, little bride. He's working on his end. Daniel was so weakened in that prayer. And that can happen. I it happens to all of us. We can sometimes feel so weak, maybe so weak in our faith or so down or discouraged or mind battles or we don't have victory or we got this or we got that. Amen. Amen. But the hand of the Lord touches him and gives him strength from his travail. The Lord knows exactly what you need when you need it. Amen. Glory to God. sounds so contrary. You know, maybe just tonight if we just all stands to our feet tonight. So many things about the scripture may sound so contrary to to reasoning and even even just talking with a co-orker today about faith and she had this comment and I I told her, you know, faith, you know, is the substance of things hoped for. It's the evidence of not things not seen. Evidence is something that furnished proof. And then my and then she kind of piped up and she said, "Oh, and the the the proof isn't furnished yet." I said, "Yeah, the proof is furnished. It's in the word that he health all my diseases." So that's my that's my furnished proof that it's already done. And she just said, "Well, that's kind of a backwards way of looking at it." I said, "Well, yeah, I guess it is, but that's what the word says to do." Amen. You stay with that. Maybe tonight you needed a little bit of of encouragement. And you know, he need you he knew you needed to hear his word to put the right amount of light or sunshine on your faith and bring it forth. Amen. We started there. We opened up with with Jacob just play with with whatever's on your heart. Actually, let's let's uh what's that song I wanted to sing? Let me look at this song. Uh I give my mind I give my mind completely to you, Lord. You know that one? Okay. When Jacob stands there, Jacob's battle came. You know, he had the blessing of his father. He experienced the supernatural many times in his life. He came face to face with angels. He had visions. He dreamed dreams. Then even leading up to his experience, you see Jacob on this road faced with fear to see his brother after all these years because he knew that Esau had made that declaration to kill him. And that's why Jacob was sent away. And the Lord sends in that dream, "Go back into the land of thy kindred." So we He had the message from the Lord. Go back into that land. We have the message from the Lord. Amen. Yeah. We have that message. He had his mission. Go back into that land. We have our mission. Take God at his word. We move forward with it. Then on his way, scripture says that the angels of God met Jacob. Even after all that, just a few verses later, he was still afraid. Verse 7 in chapter 32 of Genesis says he was greatly afraid and distressed. Then in that fear, he tries to come up with his own plan. Saints, tonight when when you do stand at that very point, Jacob did. You have the word of the Lord. I promise you, every single time that fear and doubt, they'll try their best to overcome you. They'll [snorts] explain away that victory. They'll they'll place a thought of that. But let let those thought be fuel to the fire of the Holy Ghost that's in you. Let those thoughts be fire and fuel that if those thoughts are happening, if those things are are trying to to to get you to doubt something, then something is real. Something is something is anchored in you. Amen. Jacob said, "And I Jacob said, I'm I'm not even worthy of the least of thy mercies." Oh, that's that's me. I'm not even wor worthy of the least of thy mercies or all thy truth. He says, but he says, deliver me. I think every believer tonight can raise their hands and say, identify with that. I'm not even worthy of the least of thy mercies and thy truth. That truth of the message you've given us. I'm not even worthy of it, Lord. Oh, but deliver me, Lord. Hallelujah. Glory to God. We have these words. We have the promises. Yet, circumstances arise and we forget who we are. And I'm here tonight to remind you of who you are. I'm here tonight to remind you of your position. It's all part of his divine plan. Finally, Jacob gets so sick of himself and his fears and his mess ups and cowardly behavior. He finds himself alone with God. No wife, no son, no daughter, no distraction. And he started wrestling it out. And then this is where he says God he sees God face to face like the scripture says. Brother Brandham says it beautifully there. He walks differently after that. But from that time he [music] was a and then in the in the first verse of the next chapter Jacob lifted up his eyes. Just drown out the cares [music] of life tonight. The thoughts of discouragement the the pressures. Let's lift our eyes tonight. [music] We have our message keep in step little bride. Amen. Listen to my word. Diligently seek him. He's a rewarder for those that diligently seek him. Verse 6, chapter Hebrews. [music] And he is faithful. Die out to your will and let's have a victory today knowing that it's time for our prodigals to come home. Amen. It's time for our faith to rise up into another atmosphere and to turn the tides. Amen. Hallelujah. Let's just bow our hearts before the Lord. Heavenly Father, Lord, we thank you for the word that you brought forth to us tonight, Father. We accept it and we believe it, Lord. Father, we just give you praise and honor and glory tonight, Father. Lord, it's in our it's in our makeup, Lord, for that nature of that old flesh of mind, Father, to get in the way. And Lord, for there's hindrances and it's just in that flesh of mind. But Lord God, something deep inside just screams that I love you, Lord, and I want to be right with you, Lord. And I just lay on that bosom of of of Jesus tonight. And I just ask, Lord, if there's anything in there [music] that may be besetting in my life, Lord, is there anything in there, Father, that you would want to me want me to rid of so that that so that that right temperature, Lord, can just, Lord, shine on that seed that I know that is in there.

Father, I pray for each one of them. Father, Lord, I pray that you'd go with them and be with them. Encourage them in their walk with you, Lord, and just give them a little bit more strength to keep pressing on and to keep in step. Father, we love you so much. And we thank you for the word that you brought forth, Lord. And we just give you praise tonight. Ask all these things, Lord, in the wonderful, precious name of Jesus Christ. Amen.

And uh we have brother Bruce Paris [music] here. He says, "Good morning, my dear family and Christian brothers. Just a quick update regarding my recent headlong dive into my activities. My head wound [music] is responding nicely to the the natural healing process. However, the other members of this aging vessel are now beginning to complain that being ignored by manifesting their displeasure and revealing [music] that they made contact with that resilient material called concrete. My forehead has become swollen. My right knee has turned a bruising yellow color along with my left finger and knuckle. In spite of all the complaints my [music] brain is receiving, I'm pleased to say that the Lord, my savior and Jesus Christ, has spared me from complete destruction once again for whatever [music] purpose he sees fit. Amen. Amen. Each individual needs to take stock of the fact that we're predisposed to God's perfect will for our lives. It's by his great love for as sons and daughters, vessels of honor, which entitles us to his many promises. Amen. He's preaching to us. One is that he would prosper in health. I'm a testimony of his great mercy. For he has spared me from [music] the im imminent destruction by his grace many times. Thank you for all the many prayers [music] and well wishes. God bless each of you. Oh, was I supposed to read the whole thing? [music] Amen. Praise the Lord. Military personnel that have been acquainted with Sister Linda Maxwell. Um M Linda Maxwell has sent her prayer request in uh they are in a difficult situation in S Syria under supplied uh with ammunition, medical equipment, medicines needed for the wounds. They are almost constant attempted assaults by enemy forces. Brother Travis and sister Deborah Traveling Mercy's uh brother Joe had a show family traveling to New York and will be ministering for brother Ivon Kerrion uh while there. May the Lord bless their trip, bless the services, sickness in several Bethl families tonight, needing a touch from the Lord. Many sick families. Uh, brother Matt's wife Rachel and others home tonight sick. Uh, traveling mercies, I think brother JD and his wife leaving tomorrow. Um, traveling mercies for me and my wife were leaving to for Michigan in the morning as well. So, if you have an uplifted hand before the Lord, we're just going to take these requests and these needs. Heavenly Father, Lord God, we just lift all these requests before you, Lord. brother proofs, Father God. Lord, he just has this Lord God, this this body of his, Father, he just, Lord, it's calling out. Father, I pray in the name of Jesus Christ, you just completely heal him. Lord God, take away every, Lord, bruise, Lord, take away every ache, every pain, Father God. Lord, sometimes our our minds, our bodies, they don't exactly, Father God, measure up to the word. But Lord, we accept the word on the basis of the faith that we that we've heard tonight, Father. We accept it. We accept faith based on your word, Father. Father, we just pray for Lord, brother Travis, Lord, and sister Deborah for for traveling mercies. Father, we pray, Father, for Brother Joe as he's away ministering and brother JD as he's traveling. Lord, and many sick members tonight, Father, that that request there for Sister Linda, Lord, those uh [music] in Syria, Father, I just pray that you'd go and you'd, Lord, do what you do best, Father God. You'd be in control of the situation, Father. There's many needs here tonight, Father. [music] I pray that each you'd just take each one of us home safely tonight, Father God. And Lord, if there be a testimony tonight that you'd lay on someone's heart, Lord God, let it just be fuel to the fire of the Holy Ghost in our lives tonight. Father, thank you for [music] the word that you've given us. Thank you for all you do in our lives, Father. We love you now. And we ask all these things [music] in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. Amen. Amen. Do we have any testimonies [music] here tonight? Any testimonies? Any testimonies? We hand that back to us. Um the boys me twice during this trip. Um the first time we landed at for our layover in Dallas Love airport and I had had less than two and a half hours of sleep uh in 24 hours. And I had drank some awful hot chocolate on the plane because I wanted to drink something warm and soothing, but I didn't want to drink coffee and keep myself awake if I could go to sleep. And then when we got to the airport, I ate some just junk food. And uh all of a sudden, I just I mean, my brain was jello. I was getting bodyachches. And my stomach is just churning and churning and churning. and didn't want to accept even water. Um and then all of a sudden in front of hundreds of people, my son Milo started praying for me [laughter] and um 30 minutes later it was like nothing had ever happened. Amen. So the innocent faith of a child Amen. that hasn't been corrupted yet by the world. [laughter] You know, that's the kind of faith that he wants us to have. Amen. And um and then the other thing that happened, I think I came in contact with somebody who had something uh right when I got here. Um and I started feeling it like the next day in my throat and I thought, "Oh, well, it's just my sinuses because I always have sinus issues." and the burning drainage. And it just kept getting worse and worse and worse. And by the time I got home, got back that night, I had full-on fever, um, chills, bodyachches, just awful. And um to preface this, you know, the devil was trying [snorts] so hard to stop me from getting to those services this weekend. I mean, everything was going wrong. And just like brother Andrew Glover said, you know, your spirit and your flesh are ready to give up, but something on the inside of the soul is, you know, and God was kind of quiet through all of it. And I'm like, Lord, what's going on? Is this, you know, is this trip not your will? What's what's happening? And I thought, no, that can't be it. You know, why would the Lord want to stop me from hearing the word? you know, I've gotta get there. Our plan plane leaves at 5:40. Service starts at 7. Gotta get there. [laughter] And even just uh feeling um tired on the drive there, thinking, well, you know, and then Milo falls asleep in the car and nobody's feeling great. And I'm thinking, well, maybe we'll just skip this one service and it'll be okay. And I and then I said, no, I am not doing it. I am getting there because it it was like the devil wanted me to be in a position where I couldn't even stream the services, not even hear it because he knew that Saturday service I was going to get exactly what I needed to fight against what he had been doing to me in my mind for several weeks. Just nonstop. Just the doubt. Oh, it really it's you [snorts] can't be one of them. Do you remember what you did? Do you remember how bad you were? I don't think so. Not you. You know that kind of thing. But I got exactly what I needed. I'm free. Amen. I have liberty. Thank you, Lord. And I am living the jubilee. Amen. And you can't do anything about it. And I'm not going to do anything to offend my Lord. Amen. And so the joy that came with hearing the word and that blessed assurance that the Lord was with me and he wanted me to hear that and I passed. It was like I don't know if that was a test but whatever it was I passed and I got there and I got what I needed. And when I was um thinking about giving this testimony last night [laughter] in the middle of the night, I promise you this happened. I thought, Lord, how am I going to explain this that would help other people? Because I have faith for lots of things in life, but faith for my own healing has been an issue. like I can pray for somebody else's healing and I have all the faith but for my own it's like again the devil gets in there and but okay I'm so when I was sick I prayed and it the prayer was different because I had that joy of that blessed assurance and I fell asleep between 11:30 and 12 and at 2:25 I woke up and I was like, "Oh my goodness, my symptoms are gone." Um, and I I mean, I was healed. And when I was thinking about how can I give this testimony and help somebody else who's having the same issue, that exact scripture came to me, which was um, faith comes by hearing. Amen. The devil did not want me to get there and get that faith from hearing and it happened anyway. Wow. Amen. So, thank you. Amen. [applause] Anybody else have a testimony tonight? [applause] This is something that kind of happened a while ago, but I was telling it to someone the other night and I was like, "This is, you know, pretty cool, so I'm going to share it." But um I was driving home from work and I realized that I was out of gas. I had like no gas and I was kind of on kind of a back roads and there there are no gas stations and I was like broke at the time. [sighs and gasps] So I was like God put it on my heart to just start praying. I was like, "Lord, I'm broke. There's like no gas stations. I have no way to get gas." So I sat there and watched the gas meter dial thing literally like go up. Wow. And God literally filled my tank up with gas in that moment. So, I thought that I would share that. [applause] Praise the Lord. Amen. Probably have time for one more. Anybody have anybody have another one? Uh this is uh kind of a it might not mean a lot to a lot of people, but it meant a lot to me. Um the other day I was driving down the road and the joint my truck blew up and um that's not a good thing. And uh I I remember talking to brother Micah cuz he had just basically third pulled his truck back to working [laughter] and I made a joke on on Sunday night when we went to the um to the Yans, man, you got another one of those? I could really use one. [laughter] But uh anyways, I I I was thinking about it. I'm like, man, Lord, I really need this. What had happened is that when the the reason the U-jint failed is I'd had it repaired previously and the guys who had repaired it, who put the new U-jint in it for me, um had damaged it and then when they repaired it, the repair failed and so it just blew all the U-jint up and it was a I was going to have to get a new drive shaft is what the long and short of it was. And um I was thinking like, well, I could try to repair this and even if the Lord fixed that part, because in my mind I was like, man, if the Lord could just fix that part, I could get new U-jints. And I thought, well, even if you did that, I was still gonna have to pay a bunch of money to get all the U-jints put in it and new bearings and stuff. And um so I was like, well, I'm just gonna I'm just gonna order a new a new drive shaft and and move on. Well, I had ordered a drive shaft and then something said, "Hey, you need to double check because the the year that you ordered that for is wrong." And I I'd got it a year off. And so I canceled the order and when I got home and double checked it, I had ordered the right one. Like, well, that's weird. And when I went online to the to the online uh parts catalog, a new listing popped up for a refurbished drive shaft that's exactly the same drive shaft that I had with all the bearings and everything put in it. And the cost of it was exactly what the cost of having my old drive shaft get new bearings and stuff put in it. So, it ended up being exactly as if God had fixed my my original drive shaft. And it just meant a lot to me because it was it was uh I I you know it's it it saved me a lot of money and I can get my truck fixed and it it I don't know it just meant a lot to a lot to me and the the Lord kind of answered my prayer and get me getting me my my truck fixed. Amen. [applause] Lord, let's sing that. Let's sing that whatever you have on your heart, bro. God. God. Amen. Let's just sing one one line of this. God is so [music and singing] good. God is [music] so [singing] good. God is so [singing] good. [music] He is so good
