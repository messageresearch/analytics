hearts and on the minds of the Believers Lord Lord as we come to this at atmosphere we believe that you have a a special evening for us tonight Lord to get become more like Jesus Christ and so Lord we know that this is what the opening of the seventh seal has come to do is make us more like Jesus a greater reflection Oneness restored we thank you for that Lord and we ask one once again father let us all step out of the way may we lay aside the cares of this life and the burdens of the day and Lord may we fix our eyes upon Christ the author and the finisher of our faith Lord may we we lay aside every weight which would entangle us and try to hold us down lord and may we strengthen the feeble knees Lord for it will take your strength flowing through US Lord to make it in this hour we look to you we commit ourselves to you we ask once again for your anointing to come upon your word Lord and that you would declare yourself to us tonight in Jesus name amen God bless you Saints we'll go right to the word I had planned on doing a missions report tonight and maybe I'll do it later but coming out to such an atmosphere I felt that it would be too drastic of a change of order go into a missions report and I want to go right to the word in Revelation 8 verse one my subject tonight is the seventh seal Oneness restored and when he had opened the seventh seal there was silence in heaven about the space of half an hour and so everything was quiet was silent was a holy hush the greatest beings as we saw saw this all this whole picture set the greatest beings in all of creation were there before the throne and they stood in awe and amazement at the opening of the seventh seal they knew that at the opening of this seal the now the book of redemption is fully unsealed and opened and something spectacular must soon take place which was even hidden to the very angels of heaven and at the time uh that Jesus was on Earth it was even hidden from the son the father only knew it and now there's a great Revelation that's about to take place then we go to ver verse two and I saw the seven angels which stood before God and to them were given seven trumpets and another angel came and stood at the altar having a golden sensor and there was given unto him much incense that he should offer it with the prayers of all the saints upon the golden altar which was before the throne and the smoke of the incense which came with the prayers of the Saints send it up before God out of the Angels hands and the angel took the sensor and it filled it with fire of the Altar and cast it into the Earth and there were voices and thunderings and Lightnings and an earthquake May the Lord add the blessing to the reading of his word he can be seated and so we see these angels they're standing after the opening of the seventh seal and they're standing as though they in a Priestly role there before God to soon blow these trumpets and remember we spoke before and brother Jason has spoke the trumpets always call Israel to the feast they're used of God to bring Israel back into the their position when Israel returns to the land they do so under the work of the seven Trumpets the trumpets sound through the age however they're revealed by the two witnesses during the tribulation period so just as the seals come to us as a revelation at the End of the Age though they happen throughout the age and and and and the events even go after the opening of that seventh seal so will the trumpets have the same effect upon the 144,000 through those two witnesses but before that can happen before that Revelation can happen during the tribulation period another Angel comes forward another Angel comes forward and is given incense to burn with the prayers of the Saints so he's coming into the go area where there's a golden altar right where what else is in the area of the golden altar seven golden candlesticks so who walks in the midst of seven golden candlesticks other than the Lord Jesus Christ one like unto the son of man amen and so then we have this High Priestly position entering into that there's many details to this that I want I don't want to get bogged down if anybody has questions you're always welcome to get in touch with me but I just want to go quickly over this because it's it's not the main point so this Angel entering into this High Priestly position now he comes not by The Mercy Seat The Mercy Seat issue has has already been dealt with in previous chapters in The Book of Revelation now here he stands not in the most holy place in heaven but in the Holy place to offer incense and the incense notice he's going to offer given unto him much incense that he should offer it with the prayers of all the saints so the prayers of all the saints is a smoke from The Altar and the prayer and the incense is also causing a smoke from the altar it's not the same there's a distinction right and so uh we understand if we look in the Old Testament God when when when God was angry with the children of Israel God spoke to Moses and said Aaron take a sensor and burn incense among the people to act as an atonement for them you think well without the shedding of blood there's no remission absolutely that's right and of course when we look at anything in the Book of Revelation we have to understand it in the context of the blood of the Lord Jesus Christ and yet we have different types throughout the Old Testament and here we see enacting another type before us that at the opening of the seventh seal there's an incense atonement which is the application a further application of the blood of Christ upon the bride for us in this hour that's good and so again it cannot be a part of from the blood of Jesus Christ if there is going to be any kind of offering made we understand that it is connected to the blood of Jesus Christ and okay so when we see the smoke of the incense we understand it represents the worthiness the Merit merits the righteousness of Jesus Christ through his very blood which was shed for us he is he he he is our righteousness and he lived the righteous life for us this altar then of course would have been cleansed by the blood but yet there had to be had to come a time of incense being burnt and it's not the incense is not our works the incense is not the work of the Seven Angels the incense is the work of Christ in our place his perfect righteousness that's what makes our prayers acceptable to God so when the smoke of our prayers Rises up and the smoke of the incense Rises up they become one wow so there's a Oneness between the work of Christ and the bride of Christ the prayers of the saints that happens under the seventh seal and so you can't separate now the work of Christ and the work of the Bride because what when you look at this atonement that's made for us by the incense we understand that the atonement is is activating something for the the prayers of the Saints it's a restoration back to what God intended for us in John 14:12 The Works that I do shall he do also this is only restored in part under the man age under the Pentecostal message they only have a part of it the full Pentecostal blessing is not restored until the fullness of the word is restored to us through the seventh Church age messenger and so we have then the incense combin ining with the prayers of the Saints this is your greatest work this is your greatest accomplishment is your prayers and God does more through your prayers and when you realize that the smoke of the incense of your prayers is actually literally one with the atoning work of Christ that actually his very atoning work is applicable right in the midst of your prayer that we understand that the scripture tells us that that the spirit we don't know what we pray as we ought but the spirit with groanings which cannot be uttered he pray he intercedes through us so when you can understand that the work of Christ is by the fullness of the holy spirit in the bride interceding through the Bride of Jesus Christ now you're catching the revelation of the seventh seal and we can never get a apart from this Oneness the seventh seal is revealed in every type that's in the Bible the prophet said that that we understand it's a three-fold uh uh three-fold Port unfolding I don't know how to say that properly but it's a three-fold unfolding under the seventh seal brother bam said one unfolded when they were speaking about the Sixth Seal remember he spoke about all seven seals are in Revelation chap 24 six of them have all information he says the seventh is left off the Angels didn't know the sun didn't know himself all right that's the first one the second one came during the preaching of the seventh seal and and he says that's the seven Thunders that also won't be known he says till the end time it's connected together he makes that point again and again the last one comes in an unknown language says the end time seal starts when the end time seal starts it will be a total total secret but but I love that but it will be revealed by the messenger of Revelation 107 so again one no man knows the day or the hour two seven Thunders three it's an unknown language he says the seventh seal is the end of all things ushers in the Millennium seven Thunders will not be known until that time it not it he even said it it's connected to the third pole and that it will not be thoroughly explained but it will be revealed by the seventh angel once again I I'm repeating that and so I I I'm just going to pause going forward and feel to share my own testimony and journey regarding the seventh seal when I first came to the message I was I didn't know any of y'all even existed I was up in Minneapolis somebody gave me a church ages book I started feeding on the message step by step the Lord led me to the truth I'm reading I'm studying I'm looking at the seals I'm looking at the church ages book I'm I'm searching and one uh uh brother comes to me and says so what do you think the seven Thunders are and I said well that's oh I said I believe what brother brandham said is that accomplishes the restoration of the original faith and that under under you know they reveal they're revealing what the Seven Seals are all about and that un on the book in the book is things that are revealed like uh this is just where I was at at the time things like who is this MDC and marriage and divorce and those things are in the mysterious mysterious book this is what my understanding is oh man you really missed it you really messed up I I didn't you read the seven seal it's not revealed we don't we don't know what the seventh seal is I like oh man this is an elder in the he's been in the message for for almost as long longer than I've been alive I must be in confusion and the L and and I was sent into 12 years of total and utter confusion and I begin to study what Raymond Jackson said about it oh only six seals Seven Seals not revealed not even open then I read what another brother overseas said it's oh no the Seven Seals were broken back in ' 96 ad and the Seven Thunder are coming in the future there'll be seven men that come that that will come and speak rapturing Faith to the bride and then I then I asked brother Lonnie what was his understanding seemed to line up with my first understanding but I kept coming across quotes that that what about this what about that and I was just confused total confusion believe my first understanding Revelation was right but I went through a cloud of misunderstanding for 12 years and I was literally on the missions field looking at these Persian brothers and saying Lord I have no idea you know I've tried to study this and I've literally given up would you please help me understand this because these brothers need it's in the message it's for us to understand and there's an explanation and these brothers need it because it's really important part of the message that the prophet speaks about over and over again and I'm the missionary here that's confused and the sitting in a taxi cab the Lord said what order does that happen in said the mighty Angel descends with an open book Seven Thunders under their voices and the seventh Church age messenger finishes the mystery yes and then immediately it was all the scales fell off my eyes then I could go back to study the message and I saw it everywhere everywhere that I went so thank God that that made became an anchor in my heart that no devil in hell can pull it away from me I believe it has to be for every one of us I can explain it to you I can speak it to you but it's it's comes in unknown tongues amen and it must become a revelation into your heart and as brother brandom said don't try to be fanatical make up some strange doctrines but live a Godly Christian Life he emphasized that over and over again amen and I believe that's the unknown the manifestation of the unknown tongue is your life manifesting the Oneness of Christ and the bride and so again you you look and you'll see and the the the the things that became a confusion to me in the future home he says we have six seals were revealed out there oh my what's going on here th though there's 27 pages of quotes about Seven Seals being revealed you have these different places and and even in the seventh seal itself you see we have the completion now of six seals and we know the seventh can't be broke to the public and you see these different things and we understand when he said when he spoke about six seals in Matthew 24 the seventh was left off right so does that mean that's all there is to it it's finished it's over with well that's what people thought he says in question is answer is number four have the seven Thunders which equals seven Mysteries already been revealed were they revealed in the Seven Seals but are yet not known to us as the Thunders yet no they were revealed in the Seven Seals that's what the Thunders was about seven Thunders that had uttered their voices and no one could make out what it was John knew what it was but he was forbidden to write it he said but the seventh angel in the days of his sounding listen to this this is Brother branham's um interpretation or synopsis of Revelation 10:7 and and we'll comment on it this is his synopsis he says but the seventh angel in the days of his s found in the seven Mysteries of the seven Thunders would be revealed amen so whatever the seven Thunders spoke have already been revealed by the seventh Church age messenger and so connect it together in the days of the voice of the seventh angel what does it say when he's about to sound the mystery of God should be finished as it was revealed to his servants the prophets but brother Branham finishes the verse with the seven Mysteries of the seven Thunders would be revealed so what is the mystery of God the seven Mysteries of the seven Thunders would be revealed that which was hidden John knew it he was forbidden to write it but it was H it was a hidden Mystery it's then revealed and finished in the days of the voice of the seventh messenger and it's it's significant that it says as it was revealed to his servants the prophets brother bandam says it can't be a new Bible can't be some new revelation it's what's already written in the word it's been hidden and sealed away from the church because they've Fallen away from the original Faith but now it's it's broken open and revealed and restored back to the Bride of course in the church ages book some people like to dismiss the church ages book I'm not one of them it's it says the same thing just in a more detailed way people say well brother brandham never said this in uh in his sermons he said this this is the details this is the breakdown I just read it to you all right in chapter n now this messenger of Malachi 4 in Revelation 10:7 is going to do two things one according to Malachi 4 he will turn the hearts of the children to the fathers two he will reveal the mysteries of the seven thunders in Revelation 10 which are the revelations contained in the Seven Seals it will be these divinely revealed mystery truths that literally turn the hearts of the children to the Pentecostal fathers exactly so so the seven Thunders are restoring us back to the original Faith the opening of The Seven Seals there th that's that's the Revelation that comes to us but then there's a book that comes down from heaven and there's Mysteries contained in the book and seven Thunders utter those Mysteries to the prophet of God we don't we don't literally hear seven Thunders speak we the prophet hears the seven Thunders speak the prophet hearing those seven Thunders speak then communicates the Revelation to the people but do you realize that Revelation 10 doesn't end at verse 7 because the goal of the finishing of the mystery was the was The Taking of the book and it's an it's actually if you realize it it's an it's it's for the bride body as a whole but each one of of us as individuals must enter into the experience of the taking of the book you you you can't just say oh great the prophecy is fulfilled no you have to take the book you have to eat it and have the experience and say my it's sweet then it has to get into your stomach and say whoa okay I got some changing to do I got some transformation to do this is bitter on my belly because I got God's got some work to do but then ites even doesn't finish there because we realize the bride then actually is the final voice to the final age under their messenger when they catch get the revelation of what the prophet said is is we're not called to be parrots but we're called to communicate the Revelation it's different you can be a parrot and you can say word by word what brother brandham said and not say what he meant and and it it it's it's Way Beyond mere understanding and parsing out of English language but it's supernatural Revelation that has to come to the bride and we understand that it it's it's a season right since it's the days of the son of man it's not the instant of the son of man if you can if you can really realize it when brother brandham says the seventh is left off we understand the seventh is actually a person amen if you really can grasp it the seventh is a person descending from heaven with an open book to reveal it to you and actually to to give it to you to eat and then the next thing that you must do is you must speak the word that's already been spoken it's not enough to just press play every one of us should press play because we must feed on the message of the hour we must feed on on on the tapes yeah the mp3s and and this because in in the ages past we understand what's the devil done he says oh that's only for the ministers the word is only for the ministers and the people they don't need that no we all need it because it's an accountability to the word for all of us each one of you C can't just sit there and say oh I just take in what the anointed preacher says you have to study you have to seek you have to eat part of eating is hearing the word but not the only part you've you've got to assimilate it for yourself you could sit and and listen to me preach and listen to brother J Jason preach and not understand a single word Judas had the best pastor in the whole world and he didn't turn out well that wasn't the pastor's fault that was the man's fault and that's your fault if you don't take what brother Jason is is preaching to us and feed on it and understand it you just come to church well it's an experience oh come on the word of life is being given to you write it down study it look at it refer back to it feed on it so that you really understand it because this is where the rapturing faith comes from Revelation 10 8-11 is talking about rapturing faith and it's not it's even not enough just to eat it you have to speak it you have to prophesy again now you're not bringing your own prophecy you're not bringing your own version of Prophecy you're bringing what's already been spoken by the seventh Church age messenger because even he is is bringing what the prophets have already revealed and so the the point is getting the word from the hand of the Angel which is Christ the son of man that's come down to reveal himself the Lord that has descended from heaven with the message it's not hyperbole he's come down in a different way today than he's ever been with the church because he's come in fullness All Through the Ages it was in part even in the first age the purpose was to bring the fullness to the bride but before they could get to it they fell away and so now then Ephesians 4 can truly and fully come into effect I want to look at the uh very uh commonly quoted uh portion of Christ is the mystery of God revealed again I believe connecting this together with the last two quotes I read is is very critical because then you begin to see further what the mystery of God is and and a further unfolding of the Oneness that I spoke about already all right we had the we were how much Oneness can we get in the seventh seal we've got we've got the incense which is the atonement of Christ coming together with the smoke of the prayers of the Saints then we got Christ coming down with an open book with with with the revealing of the word well what is the revealing of the word in the open book it's the revealing of Christ right and it's the means what is it supposed to do it's not just to stop at the seventh Church age messenger Angels descending to get it to you for you to eat it then you become one with the word then you can speak the word all right God's great mystery of how it's a secret he kept it a secret nobody knowed nothing about it even the angels didn't understand it see he didn't reveal it that's the reason under our seventh mystery when the seventh seal was opened there was silence why was there silence in heaven because it was a mystery was UN it was unknown amen Jesus when he was on Earth they wanted to know when he would come he said it's not even the son himself don't know when it's going to happen see God has this all to himself it's a secret and that's the reason there was silence in heaven for a space of half hour and seven Thunders utter their voices and John was even forbidden to write it see the coming of the Lord that's one thing he hasn't revealed yet how he will come when he will come it's a good thing he doesn't no the quote doesn't finish there he has showed or revealed it in every type that's in the Bible therefore the entire Bible is the revelation of God's mystery in Christ H the entire Bible is an expression of one goal that God had one purpose he wanted to achieve in the entire Bible and all the acts of the Believers in the Bible has been in type and expressing what God's Great goal is and now in this last day he has revealed it and shows it did you just hear what he said he said he's revealed it and showed what the coming of the Lord is and God's help we'll see it right here this morning What the Lord Has in his mind all along and has expressed it therefore you can see the great meaning of what it's been to know this and then to try to bring it to the people see and then you don't I haven't went into details to try to explain it as God has revealed it to me my so the title of the message is Christ is the mystery of God revealed where do we find the terminology the mystery of God in the Bible a few places but one in particular that we've just referred to Revelation 10:7 so the Myster of God should be finished so when we see that language should be finished it means that there's coming to be a completion right there's a revelation contained into that but really what the prophet's purpose is to do is to bring it to completion to bring it to a finishing work because remember the angel comes and says time shall be no more well it doesn't mean literally the end of time because even the millennium has time right but it says there will be no longer a delay a delay to what the mystery of God being finished because the mighty Angel has come down all right and remember brother I want to I want to hold my thought there brother brandom refers to Matthew 24 and he says this is talking about the coming of the Lord and that it's been it's revealed in every type in the Bible and that God has revealed it to us in this day so we find then that which was a secret the angels in heaven didn't even know is now being revealed so let's read it Matthew 24 42 uh 36 but of that day and hour knoweth no man no not the angels of heaven but my father only see it's a secret there's silence in heaven the space of half an hour right and John was forbidden to write don't write about it don't reveal what it is it's sealed up Daniel told us when is it it's sealed up until the time of the end we'll refer to that again in a few minutes but as the days of Noah were so shall also the coming of the son of man be so the coming of the son of man has been revealed and shown and every type in the Bible manifests it and we know it in this day so the coming of the son of man the seven Thunders are speaking and revealing that which was secret hidden to the angels even to the Sun the seven Thunders are revealing the revelation of the son of man the coming of the son of man this this word coming speaks of his personal presence his very presence he's he's what does the prophet say in the Rapture message the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout the shout what is the shout it's the message going forth first the living bread of life bringing forth the bride so the Lord has already descended not a nail scar but in spirit form but then as then we go back to Christ is the mystery of God revealed what does that sermon tell us because the world would say the you know the coming of the Lord is it's going to be a really loud noise you know and there's going to be an angel come out with a big trumpet and blow this trumpet and then the whole world will will be raptured you know like billions of people will be missing from the earth that's one interpretation of it you know and and this is the this is the way the world has it just like in the coming first coming of Christ they said okay here's what's going to happen there's going to be four Messianic figures first there's going to be Elijah then there's going to be The Godly high priest then there's going to be the Messiah son of Joseph he'll be killed then there'll be the Messiah the Son of David they had it all worked out and it was all wrong completely a million miles away from anything that they ever imagined ever ever anticipated and so has the church by their own interpretations been blinded to the revealing of the son of man in this day they've they they say you think that the mighty Angel has come down with an open book for you to eat and become one with him in this day you are literally in a cult in your you've lost your mind they said the same thing to the disciples look and see no Prophet has arisen from Nazareth they they're referring into scripture and they're literally blind and it's hidden from the wise and prudent and revealed to babes such as would learn and so as we see this and as we understand this then we can we can put it begin to put it together as the prophet did what is the three-fold purpose of God so every one of us should have this memorized if we don't let's get let's get going on that God revealed in fullness in Christ to accomplish Redemption to accomplish Calvary to shed the blood and to reveal God to us right what's the second part god revealed in fullness in the bride in order to restore pinenes what's the third Back to Eden so the this this is the purpose of redemption when we look at the mystery of God we understand then that this is applicable to his coming and to his purpose Through the Ages so what is his ultimate purpose Through the Ages it wasn't just to be revealed in a onebody Ministry a one person Ministry it's not just God revealed in Jesus Christ he wants to be revealed in a many membered body so it's God in Christ in the church all that God was he poured into Christ all that Christ was he poured into the he has poured into the church and so we can see he's descended in fullness with the complete restored word to take on a form see the the the trinitarian idea of of the godhead they're going back into eternity and trying to bring reasoning and logic and philosophy into it and it's totally missing the Revelation because it's God's per God is a spirit he's invisible but it's not God's purpose to stay in that form he wants to come into a form that we can understand who he is and he did that perfectly completely in Jesus Christ but the thing is every church every denomination stops right there and they have their own interpretation of that what's the second person of the godhead well it is it it's he's he's his own father see these interpretations are missing the revelation of the seventh seal because the revelation of the seventh seal is showing us now that actually the fullness of God is in the bride and even further beyond that we can see by that predestination isn't god making a random choice but it actually is his own seed that he had in himself and when you come forth It's your very life Jesus is that life in fullness manifested you in part but God's purpose is for that fullness and the part all the parts to come together in one under the opening of the seventh seal why do you think the devil has so attacked the seventh seal with so many false interpretations and misunderstandings and tried to say send the quot unquote Apostles and eighth Messengers to say you know it's not revealed you know it's for the future they're Miss they're saying oh look look what God did then look what God's going to do and they miss actually what he's doing now notice in Hebrews 3:7 the language of Paul wherefore as the Holy Ghost saith today if you will will hear his voice you know he has a voice today I hope you still love me but you realize that the voice is not limited to a tape certainly on a tape but if you just put it past tense on a tape you can become guilty of idolatry and Miss what Christ is doing today and you are listening to the tape and have it's a it's a hidden Mystery to you of what Christ is doing now in the bride because today he's speaking it's not enough to say I believe that there was a final messenger because the final messenger tells you that under the messenger the bride there will be a final voice to the final age and so you know the devil wants us to think you know look at all this these problems we have in the message and we have divisions and we have this God is working you you you're don't don't miss it the Holy Spirit has been revealing things and just as in the book of Acts we think see things raise up and we think oh man where's the unity and you watch the end result and God was working in the midst of all of that to bring his bride to maturity because maturity never happens in a vacuum in a place where there's not difficulties and trials you think oh my everything's going to be perfect and the bride will be in total Harmony yes they will with Christ and God will get us around to one another another but first we must be in Oneness with Christ The Living Word that's been manifested in this hour and they the problem becomes you can do two things you can either dismiss the words spoken by the prophet and say uh we have a new message today which many do or you can say oh my goodness this prophet's so amazing I love the prophet let's just listen to the prophet and do away with the LI the live voice because they've messed it all up they've made so many mistakes yes of we've all made mistakes this is the genius and the glory of God because we have this treasure in Earth and vessels and you know what God will raise up a minister and he'll preach something and it will agitate all the other ministers and they think first I must get a baseball bat after this brother but then if you're humble enough you'll realize God is speaking that's going to help you if you'll just humble down maybe the brother didn't have it all right there's probably a chance that that's true and there's a probably a chance that you don't have it all right too but God is working in a body Ministry to bring varieties of gifts through different types of preaching Ministries that's all for a purpose just wait upon the Lord before you attack a brother wait upon God because because maybe God's speaking through him something that's going to help you and to to to to bring you to a place where you can grow in him I I've seen it over the years I've been offended and frustrated with brothers and then I begin to study and I said this is the key that unlocks the mystery and I was mad at the guy because it becomes a a misunderstanding but but that is how God works we think he works in a he's a computer program God's not a computer and he never has worked like that none of his prophets were men of perfection outside of the Lord Jesus Christ all of them had a treasure in Earth and vessels we've talked about that when we preach on overcoming depression we almost could go through every minister in the word and and show you their mistakes and their errors and how they thought incorrectly and you say my goodness what is this guy trying to tear down your faith no that's how God brings the word then how do you think he brings the word now through ministers that have failings that have faults no I know there's also the devil has ministers I get that I understand that that's why we have to go back to the word and we hold one another accountable by the preaching of the word you take the message of the hour you listen to the word you pray over it you take it back to the Bible you preach it and you let the Revelation go forth to people's hearts and then it penetrates their hearts and works in him maybe agitates them and makes them mad at the preacher and then eventually they'll Search and say I was wrong and he was right or they'll say well he was wrong here and wrong there but we're walking in the word this is the Oneness it's not Oneness with a forced Oneness like Babylon Babylon forces Oneness external forces through the Great preacher through the great anointed one through the great this guy the eighth messenger the Apostle the one that's going to fix brother bram's all brother bram's mistakes the one that's going to whatever they're going to do that these men claim all these all this nonsense no it's going to be a revelation and it's going to be a body Ministry it's not going to be a oneman Ministry those that time is over with we have no scriptural precedence to say okay now after now that once the word is restored we got another one-man Ministry we understand when the word is restored that it becomes the five-fold ministry can now enter into the purpose that God has for that Ministry and it's a Ministry of what reconciliation he's given to us the word of reconciliation the word of reconciliation isn't just on a tape it's on a tape and it isn't just in the Bible but it must come from those sources through a spoken voice today if you hear his voice Harden not your hearts am the absolute is the Bible and absolute pointing to the the absolute and absolute preached by Brother brandham pointing to the absolute which is the Bible Jesus Christ and so our preaching is based upon this and every one of us we have to go back to the word and you have to check and say was that was what Brother JD said right I find that in the script because that's where growth is going to come and so we the ministry of the word praise you our literally the preaching of the word is to beg you in Christ's Place hey be reconciled to God come into Oneness with God what's the ministry of the word today come into Oneness with the fullness of the word in this hour amen and and again Romans 10 shows us how will they call on him if they have not believed and how shall they believe if they haven't heard and how will they hear without a preacher and how will they preach unless they're sent so you see this trickle down that H takes place when I look at Oneness it's it's not a it's not a it's it's it's not a a Oneness of equal rights right it's a Oneness of headship if you find in Christ is the mystery of God revealed brother brandham repeats over and over again about headship coming down headship being restored it's it's it's it's a it's a it's a dissent right and it's it's coming down through a ministry right 2 Corinthians 35 and 6 Paul says not that we're sufficient of ourselves to think anything as of ourselves but our sufficiency is of god who's also made us able Ministers of the New Covenant not of the letter but of the spirit for the letter kills but the spirit gives life in the Old Testament the ministry of the letter could only bring death because no one can fulfill the letter of the law it kills you because you're born in sin shaped in iniquity you no one seeks God there's none that's good but the New Covenant comes and says I'll I'll not make a I'll not make the old Covenant I'll not rewarm that over but I'll make a new one for you the other one becomes obsolete what's the new one I'm going to take my spirit I'm going to put it inside you and I'm going to write my word in your heart and in your mind and so this actually is the ministry of the preaching of the word right when we when when a true god-sent minister is preaching the word and again I want to I want to point this out how is overseers ship of the church to come by feeding the flock of God not taking lordship over the flock it's not being the boss brother Bram says me and brother Neville are not bosses no it's the preaching of the word that feeds the bride that's where the overseers ship comes it's not in controlling your life telling you what car to buy and what vacation you can and can't go on it's to teach you how to know to follow the leadership of the Holy Ghost and it's to bring you to a place where you're equipped to do what you're supposed to do men are equipped then to lead their families not that the pastor enters into the family and leads the family but that equips the husband to be a leader in the home this is God 's purpose for the five-fold ministry it's for the equipping of the Saints All right so then uh verse 7 but if the ministration of death written and engraven in Stones was glorious so that the children of Israel could not steadfastly behold the face of Moses for the glory of his countenance which Glory was to be done away how shall not the ministration of the spirit be rather glorious for the ministration of the condemnation be glory much more does the ministration of righteous exceed in glory I want you to I want to I want to you can take that down now at the beginning of 2 Corinthians 3 what do Paul say I don't need a letter of recommendation from some group of ministers from Jerusalem actually you're my letter of recommendation because what I've preached to you has been written on your heart by the spirit now your life is manifesting my very letter of recommendation amen so when he says you are an epistle read and known of all men you're you're the written you're the preached word manifested right and so then when we come to this the the Min if the ministry of death under the Ten Commandments was glorious right so that the people they couldn't even look at Moses how much more glorious is the ministry of the spirit right the New Covenant is the ministry of the spirit and Paul puts himself directly in there the five-fold ministry as the Ministers of that new covenant in the spirit so then how necessary it is for the preaching of the word and what does he says we we we all as in a mirror behold what the glory of the Lord face to face right and we're changed in what from glory to glory so put it all together the ministry of the spirit through the preaching of the of uh of the seventh seal through the preaching of the opening of the word in this hour then what does it do it you're actually literally looking at the Lord Jesus Christ in the mirror Hallelujah and that that image then of the word is is changing you from glory to glory even as by the spirit of the Lord now that's what is saying when it says where the spirit of the Lord is there is Liberty it's not talking about a Pentecostal church it's talking about the ministry of the word going forth to your heart and bringing the transform transforming power so that you're literally looking at Jesus Christ and being changed into His Image amen if Ephesians 4 and we'll start at verse 8 wherefore he saith when he ascended up on high he led captivity captive and gave gifts unto men now that he ascended what is it but that he also descended first into the lower parts of the earth he that descended is the same also that ascended up far above all Heavens that he might fill all things and he gave some gave some wow so Jesus ascended and gave gifts to men so he ascended up right to intercede for the church right and we know we saw the seventh seal that intercession takes a different form takes a different shape you might be puzzled by that but it absolutely does because the the smoke of the incense now is rising up to become one with the prayers of the Saints and we find in Daniel chapter 12 when the when when that mystery the sealed book becomes open when does it become open at the time of the end it says what does it say about the wise it says the wise will understand but what else does it say about the wise many will be purified and made wise say I thought that happened at Calvary the price was paid at Calvary but it had to come to the opening of the seventh seal where that atonement is made and that the the the fullness of what Christ paid for comes into the bride so that there's a Oneness but remember that this is a descending Oneness and it's a Oneness of headship and that headship ship is directly to the body but because every every one of the five-fold ministry it's a it's part of the body but remember the even the Apostle when he speaks of the gifts in the body he says he first firstly Apostles secondarily prophets thirdly teachers so we see that there's an order to the word again that doesn't make him Lords over God's Heritage but that makes them the means of fulfilling the purpose of the Ascension of Christ because the gifts it's we can call it Ascension gifts so he ascended up high and he gave gifts unto man what gifts did he give Apostles go back go to uh verse 11 he gave some Apostles some prophets some evangelists some pastors and teachers so his work of intercession for the church when it comes to the fullness of the word in the end time when the seventh seal is open his work of intercession then is what is it through it's through the five-fold ministry how the preaching of the word it's not you don't come to us for the Forgiveness of sins this is nonsense but at the same time you understand forgiveness of sins comes by the preaching of the word when you hear the word with faith Faith sins become forgiven the source is not the man the source is Christ so then we can understand here that the feeding the feeding of the flock then takes on a different shape and form when you realize that it's actually Christ the chief Shepherd who's feeding the flock and when we can understand it the that intercessory work and that and that Ministry of headship is not the man right because the purpose is not control the purpose is not personal lordship of the pastor or the Apostle or the prophet it's not personal lordship over you but it's feeding and then we'll look at what it says next verse 12 for the perfecting of the Saints I've said this many times per affecting is not the same word that we find in another place where it says uh in the next verse unto a perfect man perfect most places comes from the Greek word Tios this is a different word this word means the equipping of the Saints but when you understand that if you look at the word equipping it's used in milit milary jargon and so when when the people or the or the leader or the king would go to give the equipment to the military he gives their clothing their shoes their weapons their their defensive weapons all those things and so the purpose of the five-fold ministry then is to equip the Saints is to draag the Saints with the word so that the Saints then eat the book right and then they know what to do with with the book they prophesy again they take what's spoken and then they speak it all right and so you can understand then if we look if we look further and deeper we understand that men are to lead their homes God said I'll I'll reveal the Mysteries to Abraham I'll reveal my secrets to Abraham because I know he'll teach is and command his family after him right and so this is a essential thing you know fathers the Bible says that fathers must raise their children uh it says fathers provoke not your children to wrath but bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord the word nurture literally means the teaching bring them up in the teaching or education and admonition speaks of direct application in action through discipline and rebuke so and of course we we spoke before mother is following the vision of the father so the man is the one that's charged with taking Dominion so the first order of dominion is the family and and so mother then is to come under the headship of her husband and so you see many of these churches become so perverted because the preacher and the five-fold ministry wants to come in between this process then what's ends up happening is the preacher then subverts the husband so then the husband flips places and he's led by his wife who's led by the pastor and it becomes a perversion of the word be because the man then then he's lost his authority and usually what happens is it splits up and the pastor has his herum and so what God's purpose is is to equip the men to teach and to admonish correct discipline their family and mother then enters into the vision because she's the helper of this vision and Mission and so when we can when we we go go back to Ephesians 4 we see then that the five-fold ministry is to equip the Saints for the work of the ministry so it's equipping father mother and also the children but we understand that the primary teacher of the home has to be the father you know I'm all in favor of youth ministry I'm all in favor of Sunday school I'm all in favor of Youth Camp but I'm not in favor of that in place of the father leading the home it would be better if we had none of all that other stuff and Father's leading the home then all of that without with Father saying the church takes care of my kids you you'll wind up in trouble I promise you that the primary influence of children are not to be their peer group it's Mom and Dad the primary teachers of the children must be dad with a vision and a Mission mom entering into that Mi vision and Mission and teaching the children all right for the perfecting of the Saints for the work of the ministry that's why I say the headship of Christ is Flowing down into the ministry of the word into the fathers into the mothers and into the children for the work of the ministry for the edifying or the building up of the body of Christ again this is a prophecy this is an end time prophecy this is the purpose the goal of what God is doing for the church and I promise you as they try to say in Jeffersonville God's not abandoning this purpose he's not saying you know what I messed up so I'm just going to give you tapes to listen to he said I'm giving you tapes but I'm sending the five-fold ministry to bring the Revelation because the prophet himself said I pray that these men that come after me will take what I said and make more sense to it that they could bring it to a place where it comes to life and so I don't believe the prophet was wrong when he said that because it's squarely right here in the scripture that we're reading it and God has spoken that he's going to do it and there's nothing that's going to stop what the word says here there's no amount of devils in hell and anointed false teachers that are going to come in and destroy the work of God that he's doing through the five-fold Ministry into the bride you see you see why the the the imbalance that the devil is trying to put on people and bring a confusion oh we have to go after tapes because the preachers are all messed up no no we got to get rid of the tapes because we just have anointed preachers to preach new things now it's you got to walk in the middle of the road the revealing of the word came through those tapes but they're not meant to stay there they're meant to be preached and the the the the the we are to Plum the depths of what has been spoken by taking it back to the word not bringing our own Revelation but bring bringing the Revelation that the Holy Spirit brings through the message so he he attacks the five-fold ministry he tries to he tries to turn them into Lords over God's Heritage on one hand and he he tries to say they're not necessary we have tapes on the other hand then he tries to say well the seventh seal I mean nobody can really understand it the guy that led me to the message that's the very thing he left the message for he said I couldn't understand what brother brandham said said in the seventh seal I don't even think brother brandham understood what he was trying to say about the seventh seal and I said well I don't I don't know about that I may not understand it but I believe that there's an understanding out there and I'm waiting on the Lord to help me with that amen and I think that's anything with brother brandham preaches just wait upon the Lord if you don't understand it he'll make it known so it's a prophecy of this five-fold ministry the headship of Christ the intercessory work of Christ by the washing of Water by the word amen so we're when when when they rejected the opening of the seventh seal think about it when they reject the opening of the seventh seal it goes from the old bloody lamb right to the word and the word only the prophet says so the application of the blood then is only in the revealing of those Seven Seals which is the message of the hour so the application of the atonement then we realize is coming by the preaching of the word it's the washing of Water by the word and this is the prophecy of that verse 13 says till we all come in the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God unto a perfect man unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ that's what's happening that's what you're experiencing in this hour if you're truly baptized with the Holy Ghost and walking in the revelation of the word this is what you're going through this is what God is doing you say what about stop stop do you believe the word or no perfect Faith takes the word beside regardless of the circumstance that he sees around him or what interpretation other people are bringing to the word around him he just sees the word and he says I'll stand by that God's doing that we're in the end time the seals have been open the five-fold ministry has been sent to preach the fullness of the word they have a treasure in Earth and vessels so do I God's doing this he's bringing me to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ that we henceforth be no more children toss to and fro and carried about with every wind of Doctrine by the slight of man and cunning craftiness whereby they lie in waight to deceive but speaking the truth in love may grow up into him in all things which is the head even Christ from whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted that which every joint by that which every joint supplieth according to the effectual working in the measure of every part makes increase of the body unto that's a mouthful unto the edifying of itself in love so again this is the purpose of the five-fold ministry it's to equip you to come to the to a perfect man to the measure of the natural fullness of Christ you bring you to the place where all these doctrines are flowing out and you just say I know I I know the revelation of the word because it's living inside of me this one might say that this one might say that but I'm going to keep walking with God in the revelation of the word but then more than that he's got something for you to do because every single joint every single measure of the body must be there with the effectual working of the holy spirit in it to do what to increase the body so again that's why we say why is it a body Ministry why is he saying it's a body Ministry because the body is the purpose of the body is the edifying of itself in love so the five-fold ministry comes to bring the word and the end goal is perfect to full maturity full maturity of Christ so that we see that then Revelation 10:7 and 8- 11 come to full fruition in your life in your walk amen and then in that walk the body is growing and is being built up and and and and being strengthened amen all right I'm going to close there let's everybody gather forward and uh actually stay there let's have let's have I'm jumping the gun let's have the M our musicians come and minister to us and um then we'll sing a little bit and pray and then we'll bring you forward so as we as we understand and look at this headship flowing down it's a restoration of headship right so when when we see the restoration of headship it's the restoration of the word and coming why do you why do you think everybody's got their own interpretation of the channel That the word is going to come through and everybody's arguing and fighting and we have this great movement going around the world saying no no we got to we got our own channel we don't want the we don't want the Bible Channel we want our own own process we are on our own place and it's trying to bring a forced Unity of everybody around the world and it's trying to resurrect Babylon all over again and then to go with that there's a misunderstanding of the very thing that's going to take us home Lord help us I'm I'm I'm thankful for eyes to see and ears to hear I'm thankful for the for the revelation of the word that it's today if you hear his voice Harden not your hearts not yesterday not just yesterday he spoke yesterday we must reive the word of
