praise the lord it's good to be here this morning thank you musicians and we just thank brother Jason brother Matt for the opportunity and I know some things got changed and it's good to have a spare tire around now and then when you need it amen let's just stand and open our scriptures to the book of First Peter i' like to just speak for a few moments this morning on a thought that's maybe a little bit uh we're not going to be able to cover it I'll just say that but I I've set a timer so we'll just we'll get what we can this morning and I like to call this the door of Grace amen amen door of Grace amen 1 Peter 5 and the fourth verse and when the chief Shepherd shall appear he shall receive a Crown of Glory that fadeth not away likewise you younger submit yourselves unto the Elder ye all of you be subject one to another and be clothed with humility for God resisteth the proud and give giveth grace to the humble and humble yourselves therefore unto the mighty hand of God that he may exalt you in due time and casting all your care upon him for he careth for you casting all your care upon him for he carth for you amen father we just love you this morning Lord thank you for Lord another day of life that we could come and just use it to worship you this morning Father we thank you for breath in our lungs that Lord we can use to glorify your name this morning Lord and we thank you for your presence amongst us Lord and father how you've uh summoned us here this morning not to just Lord Fill A Seat but Lord It's a Divine meeting that you've ordained before the foundation of the world Lord that you would have a uh communion with us this morning Father and Lord as we just set aside this time lord and we lay aside our cares and Lord our thoughts of tomorrow and our fears of yesterday father but Lord we just Look to You In This Moment father realize izing that Lord only you have the words of eternal life Lord and only you have words healing Lord and only you have the words of victory for our life Lord and father we just give ourselves to you aresh Lord we just ask that you would use all that we are father Lord use our our voice our lips father may you just anoint them Father anoint these words Lord Quicken them Father bring them to life Lord we ask that you would give us Revelation to understand Lord as your spirit just go by and touch each heart and open each ear this morning Father as we give ourselves to you you in the mighty name of Jesus Christ amen amen you may be seated amen and so this is a familiar scripture to us that we can cast our cares on him for he cares for us and this is a kind heavenly father that has not just sent us here without any kind of help or any kind of soulless but he said that we could bring unto him all of our cares is that what the scripture says is cast all a all your cares upon Him for he cares for you so he has asked us to put put our cares upon him he's asked us to put something upon him and he is built to hold the load that we cannot carry and I I I know that we probably all are alike in here this morning that we've crossed that point in our life when we we can carry no more we can't we can't carry any more of this burden we cannot carry on with the with the with the weight of the of the world that's upon our shoulders and there comes a point when we must offload that to someone or to somebody and there's got to be somewhere for that to go right there's got to be there's got to be some place to deposit at that and he's told us that place is upon Him amen cast all your cares upon me and in the Amplified it would say this casting your cares all your anxieties all your worries and all your concerns once and for all on him and he cares about you with the deepest affection and watches over you very carefully and I like the way the Amplified brings that out once and for all so we're not casting these cares upon Him and then taking them back at a later date but once we have cast these cares on him they are now his cares and we we are free from that debt right we're free from carrying that load anymore once we have deposited on uh him on that and we can see that this this plan of God has has carried a lot of weight Through Time right we can take this all the way back to Genesis when when man was in perfect harmony with God and and Adam had perfect fellowship with God and I I know it's a well-taught church we'll just background for a minute that's okay and where we're going to get in the source of this thought and and and and man having that communion with God walking in the garden with God having a that evening cool experience with the Lord and you could just put yourself there it seems only as if a an imagination but it is a reality that man can have that relationship with God to walk with him and to talk with him and and to have him come and put his hand on your shoulder and say look look at my beautiful creation son and look look at what I've created for you and look at what I've done for you and I'm your kind heavenly father and this is the array that I've made for you to enjoy enjoy your kingdom son and enjoy this world that I've created for you and that was the relationship that Adam had with God right but somewhere that got interrupted somewhere somewhere that got interrupted and while Adam was with with God in that time he didn't have care cares he didn't have worries he didn't have concerns he didn't have fears but then all of a sudden the fall takes place and and fear immediately attaches itself to Adam because now he knows that there's a time when he when he must go to sleep he must go to the Grave he must go the way of of all of the other Kingdom and so he lost something there something something was taken from him right we could put it like this that that something something would have to fall below the reach of where Adam could get it something something fell below the reach of Adam's grip and Adam lost the privilege he had if we could maybe put a visualization to it as the prophet would do it would be like losing a set of keys and now you don't have that set of keys and so the doors that you used to watch through you can't walk through anymore because you don't have the key to that door right and that door remains locked and you don't have a way to unlock that door because as we beheld Lucifer falling from Heaven he had something with him that fell with him and that was the keys right that was the keys to death hell in the grave and so he took something with him when he fell and it fell below the reach of what a man could do and there would there would be a separation between man and the victory that Adam had there would be a separation between you and I when we were born into the this world in a serpent nature and and formed in sin and shaped in iniquity we would not have access to those keys that Adam lost because we were born under this Fallen nature right and so there's this separation automatic from birth that you didn't ask for you didn't volunteer for but you were born into this Fallen World and there's a separation from you and you're immediately attached to fear of death right you don't have to teach a child to fear death they just know it they know that there's something coming there know that there there's some there's something that they they have no control roll over and you just give a child a few years and and I have got five I know a little bit about it and and and they you don't have to teach them how to lie you don't have to teach them how to cheat one another you don't have to teach them they just learn that from their fallen nature right so there's things that there's already cares that were born with that we didn't ask for but they're here right they're they're in us they're they're already amongst us and there's things that we're born into but we have a way that we were given in this age that we could overcome even that Fallen nature we could over come that separation between man and God we could overcome that that Fallen dispensation right so something would have to go and retrieve those keys and we could just you could just go on a little journey with me for a moment here something would have to go and redeem what Adam lost back to the church so that we could have access to those doors again right if I had a set of keys but now everything's Touch button and we don't have set of keys anymore but but you can visualize a set of keys right if we had a set of keys this morning and there we can't reach them there there had to been somebody go to to take those keys and give them back to us that we can have access to those doors which Adam had right there had to have been something but by this God God instituted what we would call the law right after the fall of Adam there was laws right there would be a a law who wrote the Ten Commandments God did right there would be an institution of the law and and and as a fallen man there would be no way for us to keep that law there would be no way for us to keep that law Perfection but God wrote the law as a standard right he wrote it as a standard that we would have something to strive to to to live above the the Fallen nature that we were born into and so he instituted the law knowing that there was already a debt upon Adam that no man could redeem right there was already a a a a a Breaking of the law that Adam committed that no just just no man could redeem but it would take it would take someone that was built to go down to where those keys were and redeem what Adam lost so it just to make this clearer picture what Adam lost was was the access to to Hell death in the grave there there there there was an access Interruption where he didn't have the power over sickness anymore Adam didn't have the power over death anymore Adam didn't have the power of eternal life anymore but he lost access to that when Lucifer fell to hell right I hope we are we okay to this morning when Lucifer fell to hell he took those keys with him and they were out of Adam's reach right well something would have to be heavy enough to go down to where those keys went and redeem back what Adam lost right so it would take somebody built for that situation to go down to where Lucifer was and redeemed back all that was lost by the Fall Right all brother B said in fundamental foundations of the faith that we can be restored back to a a a a Eden an Eden Covenant with God where all that Adam lost Christ resp restored back to the church right that's our goal this morning is to have communion to walk with God and you know when you're with when you know when you're a small child you know maybe you're just three or four years old and you might have a fear or a worry or a a care but you know when when you crawl up in Daddy's lap it seems to go away it just it just seems to go away that you know what was just this big shadow on the wall when you find yourself on Dad's lap that fear is not so big anymore and the monster under the bed's not so big anymore and you know the shadow on the wall isn't creepy anymore when comes in and turns on the light and you see that it was just it was just it was just a fear and there was no reality to it but it took sitting on Dad's lap in order for that to come to pass and I believe that's us this morning as we have a heavenly father that all of these worries and all of these fears and all of these conditions and stripes and struggles and trials when we get on the lap of the father and we realize they're just a shadow or it's just a it's just a defeated enemy or it's something we don't have to be afraid of we have a light turned on to us so we can see there's not Superstition anymore but we are looking at a reality of a communion with our heavenly father and that's our that's our deepest desire as a child of God is to have that restored back where we can have that fellowship with him right we can have that Fellowship restored with him when we're not worried about tomorrow because we know Daddy's got tomorrow he our father has control of tomorrow's situation and tomorrow's struggles and tomorrow's fears and tomorrow's worries he's already got it in control and he's already made a way for us to get through those fears and through those trials if we could just remain on his lap if I could put it like that it's a simple analogy but when you're a little child there's nothing better than Daddy's lap right there's nothing better than sitting on your dad's lap because you know everything's going to be okay everything's going to be fine and and you know and we're not we're not typing the the Fallen nature of this of this world where fathers don't know how to be real fathers and mothers don't know how to be real mothers but I'm talking about a god- calleded father and a god- calleded mother that you know that your heart's desire is you would you would die tomorrow for your children you would die in an instant for your children children why because they're your heart they're you they're they're they're that part of you they're they're that all of your favorites are are are are funneled down into your child you know and you could see yourself in them and some of them you don't like and some of them you do like but they're traits that come down through genealogy and you would do anything for that child and you would you would do and that's that's our heavenly father but all of the traits that he sees in us are good traits all the traits he sees in us are from him and their Divine traits to overcome and this age and as he's watching us struggle through this he's just saying cast your cares on me and it won't be so heavy amen just lay what you're what you're under the burden of upon me and I'll take it right that's the scripture lay your yoke upon me and take mine if we could break that down into proper English just T put put take off your load that you're carrying give it to him and take his cuz he's not carrying one his yoke is light his yoke is easy his his his yoke is freedom his yoke is liberating his his yoke is is to have to have joy unspeakable and full of Glory because you know that you are already a winner you're not wondering if I'm a winner you will know you're already a winner so something had to transfer here because you were born with the brother Caleb you were born with a weight upon your shoulders that you didn't ask for and as as life has come on that weight has gotten greater and greater and stronger and more and more and the and the further down life's Road you go the more cares you put on your shoulders and so you get to a point where you can't carry that load anymore you can't carry that burden anymore so you've got to have somewhere to lay it down and he's invited us to lay that care upon his feet now I know this is real Elementary but just bear with me as we build this Foundation but you're you're you're carrying something that you're going to deposit upon him and where does that go amen does it just disappear when you deposit it on him but there's the real it'd be like it it'd be like me uh asking asking brother Luther can I borrow 500 bucks he says yes okay but I owe him $500 right and be like brother Caleb call me tomorrow and say hey you know what that $500 you borrowed from Brother Luther you don't owe it to him anymore well brother Luther's gonna say wait a minute that guy borrowed $500 from me what do you mean he doesn't know it anymore well somebody's going to have to pay back that debt somebody's going to have to sign my name off of that because when I borrowed it from him I signed a receipt saying I borrowed this money from you and now I'm liable for that money but then I hear another voice tell me I don't owe that money but where'd the money go it's still there somewhere right it doesn't just disappear but there's somebody that's got to pay that debt so I hope you're you're tracking with me this morning and that's that's us going through this life is is we have we have become indebted to sin we have a long list a long record of all of these mistakes and faults and where we couldn't keep the law and where we fell short of the grace of God and where we where we couldn't couldn't do our heart's desire and we fell into sin and now we have somebody following us with a little black book recording everything that we've done in life right and they said here on this day you did this write it in the book and all these cares are are coming down upon and it's hard to keep a victory when you know there's this big black book that all that you did yesterday and last year and the year before I I think we're together now I can feel that we're making a connection and all all that you had in years past has now been recorded in this book and is following you around saying you can't do this because on this day you committed this and you still owe this right we're in the large we're the largest debt carriers that there is is the sinner that is saved by grace because we know we know all of the debt that that it didn't just disappear but it had to go somewhere right and when I would fall short of the glory of God there would be Satan to record down on this day you borrowed this Sin from me right on this day you committed this sin and I recorded it in my book now now we come to Calvary and we come to a cross and we hear a voice say you don't owe that sin but you can go free you're not under the bondage of sin anymore but you can go free well where does the sin go it's in the book it's been recorded there's somebody that needs to pay the debt that we owe right it'd be like be like let's just put ourselves in the shoes of of the woman at the Jesus was there and he was invited to a feast right he was invited to a feast of a Pharisee and we we know the backstory in this we're not going to take the time to preach on it but but he was invited there to be made fun of right he wasn't invited there to be worshiped and a lot of churches out there this morning are gathering and they say that they've invited Jesus but they haven't invited him to worship Him they've invited him to let him sit in the corner with dirty feet but not us this morning we recognize that the authority of Jesus Christ is in this building and we will will not let him sit with dirty feet in the corner but we recognize the Supreme deity of Jesus Christ in this age and I choose to wash his feet I choose to wash his feet I choose to clean his feet and to praise him and to worship Him and humble myself that he may give me Grace that's right we're not going to make it of our own accord or our own merits or how well we can keep the law as good a person as you are you have not kept the whole law as good a person as you are you have not kept every line and every jot and every tit you have not why because we are born under a fallen condition and the only one that can keep a perfect law is the perfect one who wrote it himself so we will not make it by our own accord or by our own will or how how religious we can be in fact it may take us further away because that Pharisee was a religious man and yet he didn't recognize who was room and there Jesus the savior of the world has come into his house and he doesn't greet them he doesn't welcome him he's too busy car on with traditions and too busy carrying on with what he thinks is important look at that man over there out look at that you know I if if he would have recognized who it was that came into his house all eyes would have been on him yeah I don't want to yeah I don't want to use the presidents or you I want to get into politics but if your hero walked in the room or somebody that you reverence and respect let's just let go back a couple hundred years if Abraham Lincoln walked into the room you have a built in respect for him right you're going to clear off a seat for him you're going to say no take take the comfy chair take the recliner no can I get you a water do you want it room temp do you want it cold you want a coffee do you want tea right we're waiting on him why because we recognize there's a respect there there's something that that man has achieved that we reverence and we respect right and how many times have we come into these doors into this church and not realizing that Jesus Christ is walking in the room and we don't real realiz the importance of the person who's sitting next to us or or or moving amongst us or walking down our Pew or who is W looking for a seat somewhere is there a heart somewhere that I can sit in but if we really knew who was in the room we say my seat you can have my seat you can have my chair I'll gladly get up and give you my chair come into my heart and consume me if we recognize the power of the one that is in the room with us it would be a whole different situation we wouldn't be wondering well should I go to church today or should I not but the most important person in the world has promised to meet you here this morning and we wonder if we should get dressed and come to church but I say it's time to surrender all that we are and get serious with God and recognize that this is the moment this is the season this is the hour amen surrendering all and letting him have your seat right because there's a seat on the inside of you whether you know it or not it's time to let him have that seat and recognize who's in there recognize who's in the room and wash his feet now now now I didn't mean to spend that much time on that there but this woman comes into this Feast of the Pharisee right and there Jesus is back in the corner somewhere and he's defying everything that he's just taught his disciples he say it's not the way of the Pharisee it's not the way of the tradition it's not the way and then he gets invited to this feast and he says yeah we'll go and and the disciples are saying what do you mean we'll go you told us that's not the way you said you're not in the synagogue and you're not why are you going to this fancy party said because there's one person there I'll suffer humility because there's one person there I'll take on the reproach I'll take on whatever the critics have to say I'll take on whatever brother ma'am type that Pharisees party as the Hall of critics right and she had to walk through the Hall of critics now I don't have to ask you this morning if you walked through the same Hall but you're still serving God this morning so I know that you walked through a hall of critics and still here right you're still serving you're still pressing on despite all of the criticisms and that's what she had to endure as she began to walk in that room and all of those men in there knew exactly what she was they knew exactly who she was what she had committed what she had done and by the law she should have been stoned right and they watch her as she comes and she doesn't she doesn't look to them in the left or the right and that's how we got to be with criticism we're not looking at what the critics have to say because let me just say it like this a Critic will always be a Critic critics do what they do best and they criticize anything you do well that's too wild or that's too emotional or that's too dead or that's too critics will always be critics no matter what you do so don't listen to the critics and move on with the word of God and let the critics criticize because that's what they do best but Believers believe that's what they do best is carry on and believe the word no matter what anybody else is saying on the left or the right but you know that you've had a relationship with God that has told you to march on walk walk on with God Walk on beond the critics walk on beyond what they have to say or what they I don't really care what a Critic has to say because you know what one day that voice of the critic will cease one day what that critic has to say it will cease but where your voice is coming from it will never cease the voice that you're listening to it will never have an end but it will always say come forward it will always say March on brother said there's only one message of the Holy Ghost move forward amen move forward I think that's easy enough for us to get right move forward in God go beyond the criticism go beyond what so and so thinks go beyond what I think go into the holy of holies that's what the voice is telling us to do but we've got to walk through the Hall of critics to get there we're not going to get there by by by by taking this guy's opinion or this guy's opinion we've got to lay aside every care and that's what this woman did was she walked through that Hall of critics but she knew my eye is fixed on the one that can change my situation my eye my hope is fixed on the one I have not kept the law she was a Jew she knew the law and she should have been killed she should have been Stoned by their law this was the law that God wrote and she knew she was she was she was destined for hell she was destined for a Stony grave but she had a revelation to know if I can just get to Jesus if I can just get to the one that can take away my situation that can take away my past he can take away my history if we could just type it like this she's walking down this road and and all behind her is is a to put it into a a tangible it's it's a scroll right with all of her sins and mistakes following her into that room because it's been recorded right because somebody a a Taskmaster has come and recorded every mistake that she's ever made and as she's walking in this room there's just a Long Trail oh I don't know about you church but I can type myself right here because that's how I was when I came to the Lord a long trail of mistakes a long trail of of of situations that I should not have been in but there they were recorded somewhere but when I came to him I felt those weights come off of Meen come unto me all ye that labor in are heavy lad and I will give you rest and as as she comes and she I can just put myself in her shoes as she begins to get closer to that anointing brother Caleb you know what it's like when you when you step into an anointing and you feel that there's another presence in here besides just me and you there's there's there's an invisible presence in here that I can feel and as she walks into this anointing I'm unworthy I should just turn around and run I should just go he's I'm unworthy to even be here I'm unworthy to be standing where I'm standing how am I going to approach this this man without sin and me so dirty how am I going to come into His presence when I I'm So Unworthy to be here but yet he came there just for her he took on he took on the reproach just for her there they were making fun of him there and his desire was for one his desire was for her and he forsook all of The Prestige of heaven and came down just for one and sat in the Hall of critics just for one and that one was not some glorious spotless saint but he knew on the inside of that woman was an eternal seed that he had put there before the foundation of the world he said I have a meeting I have an appointment to make and he never misses an appointment and on the inside of you is an eternal seed that he put there before the foundation of the world and he will ensure that you make your appointment he will cause himself to get in front of you that you have to bump into him that you have to bump into him at some point in life because there's a seed within you and despite our own mistakes despite our own disappointments we had an intersection with Christ maybe that intersection is for you this morning but he's causing you to bump into him he's causing you to bump into him because he will not lose one he will not leave one hoof behind he will not forget a thought I know the thoughts that I think towards you he's not a forgetful God he knows where his thoughts are he knows your name he knows your situation and he's he's working everything for your good amen oh my and you think you go through situations how could this be for my good but his thoughts are not our thoughts his ways are not our ways but he is working everything for our good because he knows the outcome he knows what we have need of he knows what would take us away or bring us closer he's working everything for our good that we could bump into him and here she comes just trembling before the Lord approaching him I can't hardly preach this but got getting too emotional so I'm just going to try to preach it and not get into the and she she approaches his feet and she knows what she's carrying she knows the load she's under now she begins to you can't hide anything from him she gets into that presence and everything becomes open everything becomes an open book to her am she's remembering things she didn't even know I shouldn't be here and she probably had this whole speech rehearsed she was going to pray this beautiful speech but when she got into his presence she couldn't say anything amen she couldn't say nothing because she knew who she was and she knew she was unworthy there's no words good enough she said all that I have is in this box everything that I have is in this box this oil and she began to anoint his feet right brother BR said the oil wasn't the only thing she brought but she brought the water and the towels she brought the praise and the glory she praised him and she glorified him no matter what situation she was in so let me just settle this for you if you think you're bad in sin you're not as bad as she was if you think you're too far for God's grace to reach you you are not as far gone as she was so you need to kick that out the door because that's not an excuse anymore because what she did you can also do to recognize the power of the one in the room with praise and glory she praised him and she glorified him and she gave him all that she was everything she had was in that box every possession that she had was in that box and she poured it all out upon him why because she knew that this was her only chance to be free from that weight am wow and now she begins to praise him he says words that no man could say no man could say those words he says thy sins are you hearing me Church thy sins which were many he didn't he didn't dispute that they didn't happen they did happen they were real Sin thy sins which were many are all washed away are all forgiven you don't owe them anymore but she's looking at this l list of sins behind her they're all forgiven they're all washed away it's as if you never did it in the first place hallu where did they go somebody had to take them the devil was right there say wait a minute she owes me you ever been out to eat at a restaurant and you go to pay your bill you find out somebody else already paid it who was it you see brother Jason waving in the corner wait that was my food I ate that somebody already paid the bill so it would be like this it would be like Jesus coming down to your table saying let me get that tab let me pick up that tab let me pick up that put my name on that tell them at the front I got you tell them there I I I'll pay this debt they know me put it on my account put it on my account put it on my account now we could just count up the sins that have taken place just of of us few in this room put it on my account let alone all of the sins of the world put it on my account put it on my tab where did those sins go somebody had to owe them right let's just step into this story I I these are all quotes but I know you're a Tau church so you you know I'm in the you know I'm in the message brother brandom is talking about a story of a man a preacher in the in the 30s or 40s his name was Daniel Curry right and Daniel Curry has a has a a dream I believe it is where he he dies and he goes to what he views as the Pearly Gates Right and there he is at the Pearly Gates in his in his uh uh uneducated way of thinking this is uh this is the gates of heaven right and there Peter is at the gate and you know it's the typical Christian view of the Heavenly Gates Right and and there he's at the gate and and you know he's he's a reverend he's you know he's a respectable person and you know everybody you know shakes his hand and tips their hat to him here on Earth but then he has a dream where he goes up to this gate and he comes up to this gate and he says well I'm Reverend Daniel Curry my name's on that list and there the the angel at the gate starts flipping through the book no no I don't see I don't see a reverend Daniel Curry uh D Curry no I don't see that I don't see that name on the list he says well what happens if I'm not on the list well on the list I have to send you to the white Throne judgment I have to send you before the judge are you sure I'm not on that list I don't see you on the list so to the Judgment he goes right because that's God's law and there he's at the Judgment I believe probably anybody who's ever grown up in church is the most feared phrase in our in our vocabulary the white the great white Throne judgment right because we know how unworthy we are we know that we cannot keep the law we know that there's no way for us to attain a life worthy of the Gospel we know that so our only hope is that we get judged here by the Holy Ghost and we don't have to meet him at that judgment but we are being judged now according to our hearts right that's that's why we come and if you maybe maybe if you're a young person you're not sure why we do this we're being judged now this is the Judgment of the Bride now the Holy Ghost the tutor the guide the leader the spirit of Truth he's amongst us judging us now right so that we don't have to meet him at the Judgment later but there must be somebody raised up to be the standard of judgment and I just want to encourage you this morning that's you you are the one that will be raised up as the standard of Judgment at that time that they kept my word they did it they did it despite the opposition and the fears and the worries they kept my word the standard has been raised in this age I believe I'm looking at the standard of the age of leoa it's the bride coming out we've kept the word so we don't have to look for that judgment but here he is at this judgment and he's he's fearful he's afraid he knows that there's a greater power there behind that behind that uh Pulpit than him the judge begins to look over his case and flips his file Daniel Curry yes says here on Earth did you you ever did you ever lie yeah yeah I guess I did did you ever did you ever cheat somebody in business did you ever do something that wasn't just right yeah I guess I have did you ever look upon a woman yeah I I guess I have begins to go down this list and he's now listing down all of the sins of Daniel Curry's life and he said in that moment he realized that he was so insufficient to be where he was standing am he was so not ready to be standing before this great Authority that was speaking to him and the and the judge begins to read this down and and lay down the law and said this is the law and this is the law and the law and the law and the judge is about to to to drop the gavel and said by the law of God I have no choice but to send you to Hell according to your works on Earth and as the as the as the gavel is about to drop now you can put yourself in these shoes because this is us and as the gavel is about to drop all of a sudden he said he heard a voice he heard a voice cry out sweeter than any mother's voice ever shouted and said wait on Earth Daniel Curry stood for me and now I will stand for him and he turned to look and what did he see he saw the Lord Jesus Christ speaking out over his life it was a voice of Grace that came out where the law would have sent him to Hell Grace stood in the gap for him Grace stood in that place where he should have been Grace well the judge had just listed all of these sins where did they go put them on me cast all your cares on me for I care for you and all of those sins of Daniel Curry and all of the sins of the woman in the room and there let's just drop into a story brother brandom is it pulls over to eat at a restaurant one time and he walks in this building and there's a scene unfolding there inappropriate scene with with two men and a woman there a waitress that was there and and just just the sin of leoa right and there he finds himself all shaking his head there the fall of humanity and and and he goes you know goes back in the in a table and he said just like that I was in a vision and I was caught out and I saw like the world like a like the the the the globe like a fog around it and there was Jesus on the cross above it and there was these black Shadows coming out of the world out of the globe out of this fog and there Jesus was on the cross and he reaches out and grabs the Shadow and takes it unto himself and he said I realized that these Shadows were sins that were coming out of the world and every time of sin would begin to go up to the heavens Jesus on the cross would reach out and grab that shadow and take it unto himself brother the said what are these the sins of the world and the voice tells him no they're your sins am amen these are the sins of Bill brandham oh my how little he felt recognizing his insufficiency recognizing that there's no man ever born in sin that could be worthy to stand in that presence but there was one on the cross who would reach out in another dimension now we don't have time to get into all the details here but I I feel like we're together in this and how long ago was Calvary this is in this is in 1950 something this is taking place and he's having a vision of Jesus on the cross reaching out and taking his sins that were happening at that moment in time how long ago was that but brother B says time is not what we think it is time is not just the way that we think it is but it's a little bit different than that he says he says now this great chain of perfection was broken of time and space and time came because of sin and let's draw a picture of time let's see A Perfect Circle forever forever right and then all at once sin dropped in and put a little as my wife calls it a little hickey or a little drop in the chain so it comes now in eternity continues on but now not in its perfect condition and here's a little Gap that comes down and breaks over this way and goes out that way God had to do that because Satan caused it and it dropped down to a space of time for the trying and perfecting or for the purging of the Lost God by his Sovereign Grace that God by his Sovereign Grace might someday lift that little hickey or Gap back into the perfect circle and then she rolls on just the same do you see it he says time now time is in this little Loop it Loops down and Jesus was born from eternity Jesus was from eternity to Eternity but he stepped into the time space and was made F and came through here in order to sanctify or put a streak of blood all across this place to redeem it and connect it back with God again for all eternity he says do you see it that's all time is so time is not just like what we think it is but it's a tool in the hand of God that he is using to perfect the church to put a streak of of blood and Redemption across your life that's why we're in time amen so brother here is in time some 2,000 years after the literal cross but there in another dimension Jesus is still on the cross and as that sin's being committed he's reaching out and atoning for that sin let me say this morning he's still there he's still atoning he's still giving Grace he's still showing Mercy by the law brother brandom should have been set to hell but by Grace excuse me by grace that that arm reached out and grabbed what was rightfully his debt and took it into himself by grace and grace is still here this morning I believe that Mercy still on the seat this morning I believe it's getting close to the hour where Grace will will will rise off of its seat and come down in power I believe we're at that age I believe we're at that corner but for this morning there's still time for this morning the winds are still being held back there's still time to get into the dispensation of Grace now churches have tried law law law law and none of them succeeded but we are under a different Commission in this age where Elijah was the law Elijah came down in our age and preached to us but there was a two-fold purpose of this ministry for he was also zerubba and zerubbabel's message to the church was Grace Grace Grace Grace to the church now which side do we want to be on a church choosing law or Grace do we want the law or we want the grace if you were Daniel Curry would you say no keep the law or would you turn to the voice of Grace how could we then expect everybody else to follow the law and us not give them Grace when we are Desiring the voice of Grace in our life but Grace is given and Grace is received right a pardon is not a pardon unless it's received as a pardon now Grace is here this morning but it's got to be received as Grace I canot not psychologically talk you out of a of a situation and make you Victorious but when you receive Grace you realize there's nothing I could have done anyway if it wasn't this trial it would have been another one if it wasn't this mistake it would have been another mistake but Grace has come down in this age to cover it lay it upon me because something had to be heavy enough to descend down to where Lucifer fell and there on the cross we could dip into Psalms 22 for a moment right and there he's on the cross and he's he he's going through the suffering David is entering to the suffering where Christ would enter in on the cross and he's saying my bones they stare at me what did that to him Grace I can count my bones my tongue it Cleaves to my mouth father why is that forsaken me but he didn't forsake Him He was fulfilling Grace because somebody had to pick up all of those sins amen something had to be heavy enough to descend down to where sin itself resided where it had the keys to your Victory and through Grace he descended down Into the Depths and when he cries out it is finished because one day some someone a bride member is going to sin for the last time and that vision of Jesus over the world and where that fog is over the world somebody's going to sin for the last time and when he reaches out in that Dimension and takes it into himself he's going to cry it is finished Grace is complete the work is complete it's finished it's finished God and then as a breath brother B says all of the sin from Adam on down fell upon his shoulders that includes you and I all of the sin from Adam on down fell upon his shoulders it's finished and he descends down into the depths of hell as he walks through the corridors of Hell there's there's an anxiety demon he's here I met him before he's walking he's walking down the hallway there's cancer cowering in the corner he's here why because he's not walking down he's in his glorified body now he's in his the theophonic body now walking down those corridors with light emitting and wherever light is Darkness cannot stand and those demon Spirits began to tremble for fear because even they recognized he's here how much more we the Church of the Living God ought to recognize who is here and as he walks down those corridors of hell with all of those demon and tormentors and fears and frustrations and sicknesses and he's on his way to the chief door Hallelujah and they begin to Tri into fear and Satan can feel his presence coming since he's here and tries to throw all the locks in the door says all one Satan hears a knock at the door open up he has to obey him supreme authority opens the door I finally got you you see what a liar of Satan is he knew he was defeated but he tries to Bluff you I finally got you I finally got I thought I I had you when I got Ezekiel I thought I had you when I got Abel I thought I had you when I when I you see he thought but now he was face to face with the real one and the real one said give me the keys give me those keys and say wait wait a minute wait a minute I'm old I'm old you took the you took the the tab for a lot of people I'm old see all these sins see all of these sins here is a flip to his book let's let's turn to let's turn to Mary Magdalene oh see see all these sins let's turn to Luther let's turn to Gideon amen see all these sins these are old and Jesus confidently realizing the time time and place that he's in and and brother bam types it this way his blood was still dripping wet on the cross and Jesus said I am the sinless perfect Son of God and my blood is still wet on the cross of Calvary and I see it like this in my mind's eye that blood had had worked its way down through the cavities of Earth and down through the rocks and the M of the world and there they're having that conversation in the depths of hell and that perfect sinless blood of Christ Falls and washes away the devil's book of great sin and he can't make it's not legible anymore he doesn't even know your name he doesn't have a record of you anymore why because the blood of Christ came in atone for you that you would not carry the debt but it's been paid the Deb's been settled Hallelujah that blood of Christ came down and washed away everything that you have accounted in this life and the only thing determining whether it's for you or not is acceptance of the blood to say thy Grace is sufficient Lord what a God rich in Mercy oh but you don't know how long my list is but he's exceedingly rich in Grace brother Caleb it does not matter how long the list is Satan has no record of you why because you're under the blood and as long as you're under this token of the blood Satan cannot find you so that means there are places that we can go in this word where the devil cannot follow us there are places that we can go in this anointing where the devil cannot chase us and we think we've got to put up with this Tormentor our life no we don't there's a place within the word of God that we can find peace there's a place that we can go into where the devil cannot follow us why because he doesn't have the keys and as that blood washed away his book he said give me those keys those are my keys that Adam lost they were mine all along and I have come down to redeem back my bride that she could go through the doors that Adam walked through that she could be in the victory that Adam was in here's the keys friends brother B you can find this Mighty conqueror in the Rapture 65 and he turns down some corridors and begins to knock on some other doors and he preaches to those Souls that were lost why didn't you believe Enoch why didn't you believe Noah why didn't you believe William brandom why didn't you believe the message that I sent to you in your dispensation and in your time why didn't you believe Elijah why didn't you believe Elisha and began to preach to those Souls that were lost they were coming testifying of me why didn't you believe them and then he turns another Corner a knock at the door brother Bram says this is mighty conqueror brother Ram says there there's all job coming to the [Music] door it's him he's here he's the one I saw he's the one I saw I knew I would see him he's the one I saw back he's the one that was with me he's the one when the Thunder and the lightning was flashing all around me he's the one I saw Ezekiel come come look he said it's the one in the middle of the wheel I see him he's here he's come down we're not waiting for him he's arrived and there they see him in his glorified body just just approaching the door Abraham come Abraham come it's him he's here he's come down Sarah Sarah look who it is brother says Sarah says these words it's the one that we had lunch with it's the one that was at our tent door I recognized him it's the same one he's the same one who has come down to resurrect the Saints and there he tells him of what's going on in the progress of the plan of God and about that time he pulls out his keys you're rides here your rides here Saints your rides here and the Bible says that those that slept in Christ resurrected with him resurrected with him on the third day and began to walk amongst those a tangible and fellowship with those back in the world and Abraham said remember that was the well that was our that was our son Jacob's Well oh and this is this is so and so's family line let's go back over here here was the water that was troubled and they brother Brown said they took a tour of all of the things of their past life but then when Jesus was done doing what he was doing there with the disciples said it's time to go again he said I've got the keys to another door hallah I've got the keys to another door this is the age of the astronaut we've got the keys to another door we're we're not in a horse and buggy age anymore but we are taking flight we are in a rocket age we are in the age where we can go past what we've ever been before why because this is the final age this is the final season the final anointing he has come down in this age with the keys to a rocket you know where I'm at in the message 76543 21 blastoff let's go the keys are here brother R said that they ascended up into the ramp parts of glory and there as they approached the great white Heavenly Throne there there the Angels Cried Out who is this king of glory lifts you up o Everlasting Gates and let the king of glory come in he has returned he has returned and those that slept with him return back and are now waiting there's more for us than there is against us they are waiting on you because they without us cannot be made perfect and they are waiting on you to accept the door of Grace in your life that you can say I receive it I take it I'm unworthy but your grace is sufficient for me oh lord your grace is sufficient for me oh I to think that we cannot exhaust the grace of God we cannot exhaust his goodness we can exhaust his Mercy but his grace is sufficient but we've got to walk through the door a pardon is only a pardon if it's received as a pardon amen you can only enter into this grace if you receive it as Grace amen amen oh but I know who I am I know what I was he doesn't care that's right that's right because when he looks at you he only sees the blood amen amen well I'm unworthy I'm unworthy that's how John felt right let me just tap into this here in Revelations you're John so just put yourself in those shoes right and John looked and said no man is found worthy nobody can do this nobody's sinless nobody's spotless what are we going to do how are we going to ever receive retrieve this book back and redeem and open this and see the names upon it and all of these things that he's got to have figured out in his mind and he said I heard as it were a lion roaring behind me and I turned to look and it wasn't a lion but it was a lamb it was the sinless sacrifice of God that said there he is Behold the Lamb that taketh away the sin of the world yes that includes your sin and you are John and you are witnessing this take place in your life to say I can go free I don't have to carry this anymore but I'm free and he with a son has made free is free indeed we don't have to be under tradition of what man says but God has said you're free God has said you're free young man God has said you're free you're free from addiction you're free from from Pain you're pre free from sorrow not a words of a man but God has said you're free God has told you you can go free and all you've got to do is walk through the door where is this door for two 2,000 years man could not find this door but in our age and in our time a doorway opened there Sarah was up in age about a 100 years I'm never going to have a child I'm never going to produce what this word says I'm never going to bring forth life but all of a sudden there's a knock at the tent door and she has her first interaction with mzc something happened to Sarah she began to change she was even in the middle of doubt and she began to change why did Sarah laugh at me she still began to change why because you cannot stop prophetic Vision you cannot stop elected seed you cannot stop the perfect plan of God no matter what we think or what we have idea about you cannot stop this the devil cannot stop this can I just preach for a minute the devil had plans for your life oh yeah the devil had plans for each one of you he knew where you were going to be and what you were going to turn out to be and he had all these array plans of how you would not be successful yeah amen but God canel the devil's plans God canceled the devil's plans for your life and he said you might have this in store for them but I have seen them I have called them I have Ed them and I will not lose them from my GP I will not lose them they will be returned back to Eternity with me what the devil had planned for you God's word is more powerful God's word is supreme authority God's word has the final say I choose to take God's word over my life than what the devil would say about me the devil would say you're nothing you're never going to make it you might as well give up but God said I have seen you and elected you and my grace is sufficient for you why don't we say What God Says About Us listen to the devil and what are we going to end up we're going to end up in depression we're going to end up in hell we're going to end up in despair CU that's all he knows how to preach the law the law the law the law but our message is Grace brother Caleb when I hear the prophet's voice I don't hear law amen when I put that on just I'm my wife my wife says she she can't do it she starts listening to the tape and can't fall asleep but man when I'm ready to go to sleep I put on a tape there's nothing more soothing for me good evening friends it's Grace to me so our pastor brother Wayne which sends his greetings by the way he's he fixed it for us he said well just fast forward there's only 20 minutes left and I fall asleep right away and she listens to a lot of prayer lines amen but it's Grace to us where it might be lot to somebody else is Grace to you because you recognize what side you're on yeah you made mistakes but Grace was there yeah you fallen short but Grace was there yeah there's probably decisions that you would go back and change but Grace was there and he worked all things for your good you know why because your footsteps are ordered of the Lord I wish I had more time but I'm going to try to I'm going to try to Coast down here why would we let man's Doctrine dictate to us how we believe I think we're past those days I believe the Church of God has past the days where we're concerned about whose Doctrine and this Doctrine and that Doctrine I say let's believe the message as the message was preached and the message did not come to tell you you weren't going to make it why would God send a man and vindicate him to tell you Caleb you can't make it why would God do that but God Vindicated a message in this day to tell you've already made it you've already overcome I have made a way for you when there was no way I made a way when you couldn't see your way out of it I brought you out of it when you could not see the light I turn on the light for you he is working all things to our good there is nothing no power no sin no sickness not hell not the grave and nothing can separate us not one thing can separate us from the Love Of Christ amen you think your sin's too great oh well you don't know what I've done nothing amen can separate us I hope you understand I'm not preaching disgrace I think if there was ever a time to get back to Holiness it's right now if there was ever a time to die out to the world it's right now if there was ever a time to get rid of all of the dross of the world and all the thing I don't care what you have to do get rid of it if you got to get off social media get off of it if you got to stop to talking that friend stop talking to that friend it's Father's Day can I preach to fathers for a minute fathers let's fight for our families while there's still people to fight for for them with us I'll fight with you brother Luther will fight with you brother Jason to fight with you brother mat let's fight for our families while we still have time to fight for them this is not a time to get LAX and give place to the devil this is the time to stand up for the message and be not ashamed it'd be easy for me to P press play here and let the prophet tell you not to not to you know wear pants and cut your hair and wear makeup that would be easy for me to let him tell you to do that or you men to live lives above reproach that' be easy for me to let the prophet do that it'd be an easy Ministry for me to press play but I choose to stand Toe to Toe I choose to let my voice also ring out with the prophet's voice and say come out of her my people and be not partakers of her come out of that yeah we should not blend in we should not want to blend in with Leo deia the pressure of this age is that we have to accept everybody I do not accept everybody I do not accept a demon anointing in my home that would Rob my children from a victory that would Rob my children from happiness or joy amen I do not accept that God here a few weeks ago my wife had a growth on her thyroid they told her it was probably cancerous and did all kinds of blood tests and screens she did not accept that you do not have to accept what the devil tells you he went through a prayer line at our church just a couple weeks ago and in an instant that that goer was healed I don't care whether it was cancer whether it was not God healed it you don't have to accept what the devil gives you God is not a god of yesterday he's a god of today yes sir what he did then he will do now and he will always do don't miss where God's at today that's our that's our part Hebrews 13:8 today where is he then he's moving amongst us he's knocking on Hearts you think well I've been given this burden of sickness I've been given he's knocking trying to say Let Me In I believe we're in the short quick work friends I believe it's taking place and it may not be a public show but I believe the third poll is in full effect in the Church of the Living God for those that will open the door amen God why don't you open the door to it yes and say Lord I've not opened this door to you before but today I'm going to open the door I'm going to let your grace come in my life I'm going to let Sovereign Grace take over every time Sarah has a meeting with mezic her body changes right tent door body change down in the down in in in in Satan's corridors when mzd came and knocked at her door again body change you got a picture the cloud brother can you put me up a picture of the cloud Sarah Sarah that's you Sarah your body's changing amen who is this mzc oh brother you're preaching somewhere out there that's a what is this Cloud to you then to me this is the opening of a door in this age MDC has come down once again and he's he's come right to your tent door and he's he's saying it's time for a change for we shall not all sleep brother Caleb we shall not all go by the way of the Grave if we do we have the keys but we shall not all go that way because there was more keys on that ring that said I have another way I have another way out it's a rocket age brother said don't let your experience be any higher than you live right don't jump any higher than you live what age are we living in it's a Rapture age you better be able to jump high you better be able to get off the ground you better be able to slip into an anointing where it's not you and your works but Grace has taken over and you say not by might not by power but by your spirit says the Lord yes sir it's Grace to the church hallah who put who put the law of the Sun and and gravity and and let there be right and all of these Planet putting in in orbit science can't even figure it out today who did all that well it have to be God Sarah the door is here just go ahead and leave leave that up brother leave that up thank you amen the door is here who put who put who put the sun in or well God did right yeah well there's nothing greater than the law of God it was God's law that put put you know put the the sun if the if the Earth was just a couple degrees off we'd melt and a couple degrees off the other way we'd freeze well they had have been a law to keep that in orbit right who made that law god well nothing's greater than the law of God oh really what about when Jos josua I don't have time to preach on this but Joshua was fighting a battle for somebody else go back and read it he wasn't fighting his own battle he was fighting a battle that he committed to help a brother even though that brother lied to him he still went into battle for that brother for the sake of Jehovah's name and said we've got to win this battle so I could preach a lot on that but but Brotherly Love still in full effect amen and so Joshua was in the middle of this battle he's saying we can't lose Lord your name's on the line you promised us that we would win this battle and no giant standing before us would conquer us and it would be today amen so what gave Joshua the authority to tell the son to stand still Grace brother the B says it was the grace of God that came down and inspired Joshua to say son stand still and so the grace that Joshua poured out was greater than the law of the son amen we together yes wow who made the law of gravity amen well only a deity powerful enough as God would have to do that a gravity just just find out just try to jump off that chair gravity is in full effect gravity is amongst us God made that law nothing's greater than the law of God oh really what about when Enoch was walking with God and their conversation got greater than the effect of the law amen are we together their conversation got greater than the law of gravity and Enoch lifted what about Phillip when philli was doing a duty for the Lord and went to baptize somebody but he was late for a preaching commission but sometimes I wish I could travel like a thought like thaten what was it philli was translated right this is acts 8 maybe Philip was translated who did that Grace amen when the who wrote who wrote the Ten Commandments God did but when he said your sins which were many they were all based off those Commandments and when he said they're all forgiven oh that's good what's greater than the law of God then amen my grace is sufficient for thee God if it was based on our works how long of a of a lawless list would we have breaking offense after offense after offense transgressors against the law and if we're to be judged by the law not one of us will make it not one of us will see it over there but thank God we're not judged by the law thank God there's something greater than the law it's the grace of God and this Grace has come down in our age and I don't know friends I I I hope this brother Jason can correct me for the church when when he gets back but that's what I see when I see this I see a doorway open to this age I see the face of Christ coming down and looking upon us with Grace saying Grace Grace Grace to the church Grace Grace Grace over my situation amen this kind of Grace won't lead you into disgrace this kind of Grace will change your life this kind of Grace will come fill you and you your only desire will be to serve him your only desire will be to fulfill what he has put in order your only desire will be to take on a body change this grace that I'm talking about will change your mortal body this Grace has come down in this age to this church to you you think well I don't know why I'm here it's not by coincidence but this Grace has come across your life that God could put a streak of blood across your life and the same blood that washed away the book of sin in Satan's kingdom when John turned to see in Revelations 5 and he said I saw my name the same blood had wrote his name across the Lamb's Book of Life and the blood of that lamb cannot be erased it cannot be removed prise God but it's the blood amen that washed away my sin it's the blood blood that made a way for me that's right when I couldn't get to where he was he came to me when I didn't see a way out Grace made a way when I couldn't I couldn't do it in my own efforts Grace made a way yes amen amen when you couldn't you couldn't understand this but Grace gave Revelation you might just see a a white cloud there but Grace has given Revelation to see a doorway there's there's a doorway open amen we've got the keys Hallelujah when he arose he gave gifts unto men amen yes amen you want to know what those gifts were in the upper room he brought 120 of them I'll just give you a clue 120 gifts here's your access here's your access pass brother bam uses the term unauthorized right you know those priests are unauthorized say preachers behind the pulpit they're unauthorized but we've been given Authority this is adoption age we've been authorized to enter into can I say it like this we've got a full access pass amen amen into the mind of God where you were before you were in this Fallen condition the perfect picture of you it's in that door hlj amen have you recognized this message is Eagle food then you've heard from your theophany and what is a theophany it's a redeemed body where did you hear that voice come from it came from behind that door and it cried out to you this message is Eagle food that means you have representation on the other side of that door I know where I'm at in future home you have representation on the other side of that door so what do we have to worry about amen when I look through that door I say I've already made it I see myself in that door L I see myself just beond there what do I have to worry about I've already made it why should I worry why should I care when the very same Jesus Hallelujah I don't have a

it by your works but I choose Grace the church has tried and tried and tried to make it by their own abilities but when Divine love Capstone is projected Sovereign Grace what age are we in friends what age are we in it's a message of Grace a message of I can I've already overcome that's right by his stripes I am healed he was wounded for my transgressions he was bruised for my iniquities the
