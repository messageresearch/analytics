[0:00] read in the scriptures it seems like
[0:02] something so great is the bible we
[0:04] should we should read many many verses
[0:06] lord but i think it suffices today i
[0:10] don't think we could ever read it too
[0:12] much
[0:13] and uh lord the bible says that there is
[0:16] a blessing in reading it and even a
[0:18] blessing and hearing it read so now we
[0:21] already know by the promise of your word
[0:23] that we are already receiving a blessing
[0:27] for reading and having it heard uh read
[0:30] to us so now master would you break it
[0:33] to us as you have laid it upon my heart
[0:36] and i pray for
[0:38] real clearness of mine today lord and

[1:45] multiply the speed of his healing lord
[1:48] and may the bone and the fracture be
[1:50] recovered rapidly now
[1:52] help us one and all we commit it to you
[1:55] today in jesus name amen god bless you
[1:58] can be seated
[2:06] all right let's have my title slide
[2:08] please brothers
[2:15] now i have
[2:17] um
[2:19] a a
[2:20] mini many and i've whittled them down i
[2:23] got i went almost went into sticker
[2:24] shock brother mark was telling me we
[2:27] were talking the other day and and i
[2:29] remember i told you wednesday i said
[2:31] look we
[2:32] i had so many quotes and i started
[2:33] whittling them down and i noticed we
[2:36] started on slide 43
[2:38] and uh so uh you know we bypassed 43
[2:41] other slides and i said so now i've just
[2:43] got down to a few and brother mark said
[2:45] no i counted you got 46 more after that
[2:48] after 43 and i went oh i we can't have
[2:50] that so
[2:52] i i called them way way way way way down
[2:55] to
[2:56] a fraction of that but nonetheless i i
[2:59] only want to read them
[3:03] to you because
[3:05] first of all we believe that god sent a
[3:07] prophet in this day and we believe that
[3:10] it's a message of restoration that'll
[3:11] prepare a bride for a rapture
[3:14] so we should certainly be interested in
[3:16] what he had to say and i'm i i want to
[3:19] start very early and i want you to
[3:22] notice right off the bat now last time
[3:25] that we put up the powerpoint we took a
[3:28] subtitle uh of a rational look just a
[3:31] rational look at revelation 10. and we
[3:35] just build a rational case for why we
[3:38] believe it the way we do today we're
[3:40] taking a different subtitle god's
[3:42] promises to the last age the restoration
[3:46] of all things now how many believe we're
[3:48] in the last age
[3:50] well then the promises of the scripture
[3:53] are very clear that in the last day
[3:56] there was supposed to be a restoration
[3:58] of the full word where it had been lost
[4:01] down through the dark ages god would
[4:03] restore it all back and with that
[4:06] restoration
[4:08] comes many many promises of the divine
[4:12] working of almighty god the supernatural
[4:15] signs and wonders great miracles taking
[4:18] place and we are to see these things we
[4:21] are to see a token come back in we are
[4:25] to see that token put on display
[4:26] something not seen since the early
[4:29] church they had a dip of the holy ghost
[4:31] of course they did it takes the holy
[4:33] spirit to bring a new birth and they
[4:35] were certainly born again down through
[4:36] those ages and christ winking sitting in
[4:39] the eternities according to the book of
[4:41] revelation winking at a lot of their
[4:42] misunderstood ignorance of the word
[4:45] because you can't disbelieve what you
[4:46] don't know and since unbelief since sin
[4:48] is unbelief and you can't disbelieve
[4:50] what you don't know then they're not
[4:52] guilty of sin see they're guilty of
[4:54] misunderstanding and so christ would
[4:56] intercede for his family i'm here to
[4:58] tell you something friends the lord has
[5:00] it all figured out
[5:02] and he's got it all covered he's got all
[5:04] the bases covered he's thought of
[5:05] everything
[5:07] and so so we find that that it was to be
[5:10] restored back and a token was to be put
[5:13] on display a jubilee was to come back to
[5:15] the people because after all that's what
[5:17] pentecost is pentecost was the
[5:20] long-awaited jubilee that israel was
[5:22] promised they turned it down it went to
[5:25] the gentiles easy peasy right that's the
[5:28] history of the church and so all of
[5:30] those things under the jubilee under
[5:33] pentecost
[5:34] went to the to the first church
[5:37] and you know you can go through we say
[5:40] and i just want to weigh in right here
[5:42] and i made this comment wednesday and i
[5:44] wanted to clarify it to make sure you
[5:46] understand my position
[5:48] so there are several places in the book
[5:50] of acts because we always think of
[5:52] pentecost as just the book of acts
[5:55] but that's actually not accurate that's
[5:58] a that's a too narrow of a view
[6:02] and you'll end up in in an imbalance of
[6:05] understanding if you only see it that
[6:07] way
[6:07] and and if you and i'll say it this way
[6:10] so if you only see pentecost as the book
[6:13] of acts you're already short-sighted
[6:15] because pentecost was the jubilee
[6:18] the jubilee was the mighty god unveiled
[6:21] so the jubilee was everything that we
[6:23] now know what we refer to
[6:26] as the truth under the opening of the
[6:28] seven seals
[6:30] understand in paul's day it wasn't
[6:31] sealed
[6:33] it was the full jubilee they had the
[6:35] full mighty god unveiled they had the
[6:38] full brother adam said the abstract was
[6:41] returned now
[6:42] mankind
[6:44] could god could live inside mankind and
[6:47] christ could continue his ministry now
[6:50] in a mini-member church so they had the
[6:52] jubilee said why didn't they go in the
[6:53] rapture because the backslid
[6:55] and it went off down into the ages but
[6:57] god said at the seventh age i'll bring
[6:59] it all back i'll unseal it again i'll
[7:02] unseal it christ can't come for the
[7:04] bride in the first stage he must sit
[7:05] back down in the eternities in her seat
[7:07] for ignorance seal up the word under
[7:10] seven seals but at the end time he would
[7:12] break them and he would reveal it and
[7:14] we'd have the jubilee again
[7:16] we'd come back to pentecost again not
[7:18] the azusa
[7:20] not the azusa revival
[7:22] see now that's part of the restoration
[7:25] just because signification the gifts of
[7:27] the spirit but what what the azusa
[7:30] revival came became was denominational
[7:34] and they organized and that's the one
[7:36] that's the pentecost brother branham
[7:38] is referring to when he says you can't
[7:41] mix pentecost with this message he's
[7:44] certainly not talking about the jubilee
[7:48] he's certainly not talking about the the
[7:50] the the abstract title
[7:53] and the and the ministry of the son of
[7:55] man in the early church he's talking
[7:57] about what the azusa revival became
[8:01] under manmade corruption and you can't
[8:03] you can't mix that denominational system
[8:06] with this message but he's not meeting
[8:08] the original pentecost because that's
[8:11] what this message is
[8:14] it's not an addition to it it is it
[8:17] it is the restoration of it see that's
[8:20] all it is and so it's god keeping his
[8:24] word so now i i want you to to really
[8:27] pay close attention to that because
[8:30] when we think of pentecost
[8:33] you're now you already know enough to
[8:35] know i'm not talking about denomination
[8:37] and you're now you should know that i'm
[8:39] not merely talking about the azusa
[8:41] revival
[8:42] you should also now know that i'm
[8:44] talking about the original you should
[8:46] also now know that i'm not just talking
[8:49] about only the book of acts in the
[8:50] original
[8:52] everything that paul taught everything
[8:54] in the epistles
[8:56] written by the apostles
[8:58] the doctrine of the church is founded on
[9:01] the teaching of the of the apostles and
[9:03] prophets you're with me
[9:06] now i've told you i'm going slow i'm
[9:07] really trying hard
[9:09] i'm doing pretty good
[9:11] so so you find out that
[9:14] that that's why i made a statement to
[9:17] you that you know paul
[9:20] you know
[9:21] if you just look in the book of acts you
[9:23] do have places in the book of acts where
[9:26] it talks about great signs and great
[9:28] wonders
[9:30] there's three four five places in the
[9:32] book of acts where it talks about signs
[9:35] and wonders and the gifts of the spirit
[9:38] and we're all for it i'll take it times
[9:41] a thousand
[9:43] all right
[9:44] but but the book of acts also pentecost
[9:48] everybody says i want to go back to
[9:49] pentecost and all they're thinking of is
[9:51] we want to see the gifts operating in
[9:53] the power and demonstration
[9:55] but pentecost also includes the
[9:57] indictment
[9:59] peter's sermon
[10:01] the first thing that god preached after
[10:03] the holy ghost fell was an indictment
[10:05] brother branham calls acts 2 his
[10:07] indictment sermon
[10:08] see
[10:09] i mean you you got to go you got to move
[10:11] over into the house of cornelius you got
[10:13] to go over into acts 10. you got to go
[10:15] through acts 13 and you start seeing the
[10:17] the it's not just jews now gentiles and
[10:20] now now the mystery of god is becoming
[10:23] opened
[10:24] see i didn't understand that peter had
[10:26] to come back and give an explanation
[10:28] they're like what are you doing
[10:29] you know why why'd you give the holy
[10:31] ghost to gentile dogs and peter's like i
[10:34] gave him the whole are you kidding
[10:36] what could i do i was just standing
[10:38] there i saw a vision i was on a rooftop
[10:40] my net let down and said kill and eat
[10:42] and i said not so because i know
[10:44] gentiles are dogs but the lord said
[10:46] don't call unclean what i've called
[10:48] clean
[10:49] and then i had a vision there's men
[10:50] coming to your door go with them and
[10:52] doubt nothing here they came they
[10:53] knocked they wanted me here i go here we
[10:55] go then i'm there then i start preaching
[10:57] and while i'm preaching christ the holy
[10:59] ghost the same one that fell on us in
[11:02] the upper room fell on them and peter
[11:04] said what what could i do
[11:06] what'd you expect me to do about it he
[11:08] said i baptized every one of them in the
[11:10] name of the lord
[11:12] so because they received what we what we
[11:14] received see
[11:16] so now the establishment of and then and
[11:18] then from there i mean goodness you're
[11:20] gonna you're gonna go over to acts
[11:22] chapter 20. see acts chapter 20 divides
[11:26] the the anoint false anointed ones
[11:30] with a true anointing but paul said i
[11:33] fear after my departure go read acts 20.
[11:35] that grievous wolves and that's the very
[11:37] scripture brother branham used in
[11:40] anointed ones at the end time went back
[11:42] and tied it to that
[11:45] he goes he takes paul's teaching in the
[11:48] book of acts and ties it to the book of
[11:50] hebrews and he begins to separate law
[11:53] from grace that's pentecost
[11:56] you don't have pentecost if you've only
[11:58] if you're only chasing signs and wonders
[12:02] if you're only chasing power and
[12:03] demonstration you're missing the
[12:05] indictment you're you're missing the the
[12:07] separating law from grace you're missing
[12:09] out on election you're you're missing
[12:11] out on
[12:12] anointed ones at the end time
[12:15] see and then paul's got to even correct
[12:17] peter because he's disseminating between
[12:19] jews and gentiles and not acting right
[12:21] and paul catches him you know being
[12:22] sneaky and when he
[12:25] when he's when he's he he's sitting with
[12:27] the jews you know i mean he's sitting
[12:29] with the gentiles man he's eating all
[12:32] this unclean food that jews aren't
[12:34] supposed to eat
[12:36] and then a knock comes on the door who
[12:38] is it it's a bunch of gentiles oh my
[12:39] goodness put the stuff away
[12:42] and when he gets to wear underground you
[12:44] know
[12:45] when he get i mean the jews are at the
[12:46] door he's eating with gentiles and jews
[12:48] are at the door he jumps up cleans his
[12:50] plate quickly
[12:52] and paul says to him
[12:54] peter is that pork i smell on your
[12:56] breath
[13:00] and he and he busted him
[13:02] and paul said i confronted him to the
[13:04] face and corrected him and peter had to
[13:05] repent openly and got embarrassed
[13:08] and peter later on talks about paul's
[13:10] words are a tantamount to other
[13:13] scriptures
[13:14] so that's all so i made the point so
[13:16] then when paul starts when paul goes
[13:20] with the pentecostal experience
[13:22] teaching husbands how to love their
[13:24] wives
[13:26] and ministers under the restoration
[13:28] under the restored word start teaching
[13:30] their churches about ministers and
[13:32] marriage and how to raise children and
[13:34] how to have a family home and people say
[13:37] oh you're preaching psychology
[13:39] you're not preaching psychology you're
[13:41] preaching the seventh seal
[13:45] you're preaching the opening of the word
[13:47] see brother jd could give you a lesson
[13:50] he's not here today he could give you a
[13:51] lesson on on what jewish traditionalism
[13:55] had done to the role of women in the
[13:57] early and the days when jesus was on the
[13:59] earth and the apostles were there and
[14:00] that's why paul's got to correct it paul
[14:03] is saying look first of all abraham
[14:05] didn't treat sarah the way jews treat
[14:07] their wives now it's a whole middle
[14:08] eastern thing where the wives are
[14:11] basically just property
[14:14] and what had done that traditions of men
[14:16] and it wasn't just jews it was arabs it
[14:18] was everybody and women have become
[14:20] second-class citizens and paul said now
[14:22] that you're a christian that's that's
[14:24] o.u.t
[14:25] she's the ground is level she
[14:28] doesn't either male or female she stands
[14:30] level at the foot of the cross with you
[14:32] she's your sister in christ and you're
[14:34] to lead her by example and love her as
[14:37] christ's love of the church that's
[14:39] that's seventh seal teaching
[14:42] that's not psychology
[14:45] so so you understand see i'm i'm trying
[14:47] to broaden your minds today
[14:51] so when people say
[14:53] we want we want to see pentecost
[14:55] sadly what they mean is is a very narrow
[14:59] look at we want to see signs and wonders
[15:04] and they and anything else that's not
[15:06] that becomes you know
[15:09] they they they disparage that that's
[15:12] wrong i want to say today
[15:14] publicly on the internet that's
[15:16] unbalanced
[15:18] that's not that's not the balanced
[15:21] message we've received
[15:23] it is it does include and happily so
[15:25] signs and wonders in the power of god
[15:27] and say do you want to see it i want to
[15:29] see it and more of it
[15:31] and when we get more of it and i want to
[15:32] see more still
[15:34] and i'll never because i i know that
[15:36] that's coming from another realm and i
[15:38] want to get everything possible and then
[15:40] some and if you don't want it i'll take
[15:42] yours
[15:44] i'll be happy to
[15:45] see
[15:46] but but but don't be so narrow-minded as
[15:49] to forget all of its pentecost
[15:54] all new testament teaching is pentecost
[15:57] so just put that in your mind all right
[16:00] so now i i i want that in your mind as
[16:03] we start looking forward now you're
[16:05] going to see brother branham talk about
[16:07] i had some wonderful quotes sent to me
[16:08] by a very good friend and i loved them
[16:10] they're just so good and so
[16:12] informative there's there's many more
[16:14] that could be read as i said i'm i've
[16:17] called a bunch of stuff down
[16:20] all right so brother branham and i just
[16:22] want to make some observations as we go
[16:24] you still with me
[16:26] all right i know the next thing to
[16:28] happen
[16:29] is the restoration of the gifts there's
[16:31] a strange statement
[16:33] and i mean azusa had happened in 1906.
[16:39] and here's the prophet saying
[16:41] i i know the next thing to happen is the
[16:44] restoration of the gifts to the church
[16:47] and it's the hardest thing i've had to
[16:49] do in this pioneering work
[16:51] is to do this
[16:54] as to see the the
[16:56] people that god cannot give
[16:58] back the gifts to the church as long as
[17:00] his church is divided we've got to get
[17:03] the church together first for the gifts
[17:06] can come see
[17:07] so now so now let me let me just let me
[17:10] just point out
[17:12] that it's very obvious that brother
[17:14] branham is not denying the azusa revival
[17:17] and the gifts that begin to operate what
[17:20] he's trying to tell the church is is you
[17:22] guys are getting shortchanged and it's
[17:24] your fault
[17:25] that there that the gifts now are ready
[17:28] to go to another level
[17:30] but because you fractured and
[17:32] denominated and split up and started
[17:34] bickering and fighting i'm here to tell
[17:36] you you have stalled them
[17:38] amen they've been stalled
[17:41] they're they're here god is ready to do
[17:44] them they're in prophecy but but you're
[17:47] hindering them
[17:49] because why because you're fighting each
[17:51] other
[17:52] you got schism in your ranks don't
[17:54] forget that
[17:56] that's a big point
[17:58] if it stopped it in 1948 it's stopping
[18:02] it
[18:03] in in 2008 and it'll stop being still be
[18:06] stopping it in
[18:07] 2028 if the lord tarries
[18:10] among the true church who ought to be
[18:12] experiencing these things and brother
[18:15] branham is going to talk about it here
[18:16] in just a few minutes
[18:18] because these remember these are
[18:20] promises these are as i as i said to you
[18:24] these are
[18:26] uh
[18:27] god's promises to the last age the
[18:29] restoration of all things
[18:32] and so
[18:34] let's go
[18:35] so now he says but if
[18:37] if all the full gospel people
[18:40] would come one heart and one accord
[18:42] there would be a revival now remember
[18:44] this is a principle this isn't just
[18:46] stuck in 1948. this is for now
[18:49] but if all the full gospel people would
[18:52] come one heart and one accord there
[18:54] would be a revival that would shake the
[18:56] whole world and every say every
[18:59] every spiritual gift would be in the
[19:01] church within an hour's time after it
[19:03] took place
[19:04] that's pretty shocking
[19:07] and the only reason it took an hour was
[19:08] because it has to go global and shake
[19:10] the whole world brother branham talks
[19:12] about a meeting he said if i had
[19:13] everybody in this meeting and perfect
[19:15] one mind and one accord he said there
[19:16] wouldn't be a need for a hospital in
[19:18] five minutes
[19:20] see all right watch
[19:23] signs and wonders that was done by the
[19:25] apostles would be a minor thing to what
[19:27] would do if we could just get the church
[19:30] together it's got to happen it will
[19:33] happen it may be after i've passed off
[19:36] the scene but i want to put my word in
[19:39] this that you might know that my voice
[19:42] is this
[19:43] oh christian people
[19:46] bind yourselves together with one heart
[19:49] and one accord isn't that beautiful with
[19:52] one heart and one accord for god cannot
[19:57] no more send the gifts to the church
[20:00] while the church is separated then he
[20:02] can send the holy ghost unless we're in
[20:04] one accord that's right for it comes by
[20:07] the holy ghost see and we are to believe
[20:11] it
[20:12] all right oops
[20:14] now
[20:15] let's go on that's 48. let's jump
[20:18] several years to 53.
[20:20] there's a lot of quotes that say the
[20:22] same thing in between
[20:24] it is to my humble belief that we're
[20:26] living near the end time or
[20:28] may i make it a little more personal
[20:31] than that saying
[20:33] we're living in the end time
[20:35] i believe and i've started saying to you
[20:37] we're living in the end of the end time
[20:40] all right
[20:41] i believe it's time for restoration of
[20:43] the church that was promised that god
[20:46] would send in the last day now obviously
[20:49] this is the return of the jubilee this
[20:52] is coming under the opening of the seals
[20:54] and so brother branham is preparing the
[20:56] hearts when it happens you need to be
[20:59] ready
[21:01] because you it could happen and you not
[21:03] be ready
[21:05] and you say oh there's a problem with
[21:07] god's word no
[21:09] yeah god can't get it done that's not
[21:11] true god will get it done somebody
[21:12] through somebody
[21:14] i just want it to be me i want it to be
[21:16] you
[21:16] i want to be a part of that
[21:19] and i believe that this is the day that
[21:21] when the word has been preached so much
[21:24] and the days getting so dark and evil
[21:26] till according to god's word he was to
[21:28] restore all
[21:30] that the caterpillar had eaten the
[21:32] palmer worm had eaten will be restored
[21:35] back again you believe that it will be
[21:37] restored back again
[21:39] and this is the day of the restoration
[21:43] of the spiritual gifts given into the
[21:47] church
[21:52] 1959 but now we need it the spirit of
[21:55] god raises a standard what is it he's
[21:59] pouring in his spirit i love that he's
[22:03] pouring in his spirit
[22:05] then those who are resting out yonder in
[22:08] the grave or under the altar of god as
[22:10] the scripture says are crying how long
[22:12] lord how long he realized later under
[22:15] the opening of the seals that's jews
[22:17] crying under the fifth seal how much
[22:19] longer you have to understand the
[22:20] message was progressive to william
[22:22] branham see
[22:23] god's waiting now watch this god's
[22:26] waiting on me and you
[22:27] the church is waiting on me and you
[22:30] adoption time what does that even mean
[22:32] when god can pour into us his fullness
[22:35] his power his resurrection that when the
[22:39] church and christ become so close
[22:41] together till christ becomes visible
[22:43] among us how many are for that
[22:46] and raises the dead and we go into the
[22:50] rapture
[22:51] that screen is not working if somebody
[22:53] could attend to that that screen is not
[22:54] working
[22:56] just make sure this one stays all right
[22:57] i got one here make sure that one stays
[22:59] working
[23:00] all right so so christ becomes visible
[23:03] among us and raises the dead all right
[23:06] now we'll go to 19 um
[23:11] 16.
[23:12] a pentecostal branch
[23:15] filled with the holy ghost
[23:17] signs and wonders and the resurrection
[23:20] i'm telling you what brother branham is
[23:22] is saying to you should be here and is
[23:25] coming
[23:26] all right
[23:27] a pentecostal branch
[23:29] filled with the holy ghost signs and
[23:31] wonders and the resurrection great
[23:34] things taking place among them they who
[23:37] know their god in the last days shall do
[23:41] exploits yes we're at the end time now
[23:46] so brother branham has done two things
[23:48] and now let me just encapsulate for a
[23:50] minute let's just review
[23:52] he has shown you secondly what should be
[23:55] happening
[23:57] what is going to happen what is
[23:59] happening has is and is coming
[24:02] but he has but he began it
[24:05] i began the quotes by showing you that
[24:08] even if it's when it's been here when
[24:10] it's here or when it comes in a greater
[24:12] way
[24:13] what hinders it
[24:16] we found out what hinders it is schism
[24:19] and fighting and divisions
[24:21] amen
[24:22] all right i'm just making sure you're
[24:24] staying with me all right
[24:26] so they'll do great exploits yes we're
[24:29] at the end time now we're going to make
[24:31] a jump five more years to 1965
[24:34] well after the seals have been opened
[24:36] all right so brother branham says here
[24:38] does god change his mind does he by his
[24:41] word he doesn't change his mind about
[24:42] his word now may i say this they thought
[24:46] now this this is the story where
[24:49] um
[24:50] they
[24:51] joseph and mary came with the jesus was
[24:53] a little boy and they went to the feast
[24:55] and all that and then headed home they
[24:56] thought he was in the group of in the in
[24:58] the in the you know the group of family
[25:01] and they get many many miles away and
[25:02] find out nobody knows where he is and
[25:04] he's back in the temple as 12 years old
[25:05] preaching to the doctors
[25:07] all right and they thought he was with
[25:09] them all right but he wasn't all right
[25:12] so he says now may i say this they
[25:14] thought he was along but they found out
[25:17] in the crisis
[25:20] don't get in a crisis and find out he's
[25:22] not near you
[25:24] don't get in a crisis
[25:27] this world is filled with crisis
[25:31] you are you have either just come out of
[25:35] a crisis or a trial or you are in a
[25:38] truck crisis or trial or you are headed
[25:41] for a crisis or a trial the world is
[25:45] falling apart
[25:46] don't find yourself in a crisis or in a
[25:50] trial and he's not near you
[25:55] see now since he promised to never leave
[25:58] you it becomes obvious who left who
[26:03] get me
[26:04] all right
[26:05] enough said
[26:07] now we find out that in the time
[26:10] when this great thing
[26:12] has been brought up and we found out
[26:14] that we're missing something in our
[26:16] churches now this is 65
[26:19] and that is the power of christ now i
[26:21] want to make a statement here he says
[26:23] now look and i'll tell i'll make
[26:24] statement a second now look i don't want
[26:26] to criticize i love you and genuine true
[26:28] love always is corrective now we're
[26:31] missing christ in our church now you're
[26:33] going to see here very clearly that
[26:36] brother branham is talking to
[26:38] pentecostal churches
[26:39] all right because he's going to
[26:42] he's going he's going to
[26:44] because the power of god is moving among
[26:46] the bride but he's saying there's no
[26:48] power in your churches so he's you have
[26:50] to understand that in 1965 and you you'd
[26:53] need old-timers to give you this sister
[26:54] gene could give you a real expose on it
[26:57] that that in 1965 i mean what we enjoy
[27:00] today we have message churches all over
[27:01] the world and you have books and tapes
[27:03] and cds and internet and archives and
[27:05] all this in 1965 there you really didn't
[27:08] have that
[27:10] you you had a prophet with a message and
[27:12] you had people going to meetings but
[27:14] really as far as a message church you
[27:15] had tucson you had jeffersonville and
[27:18] you kind of could make an argument for
[27:19] louisiana although it turned out that
[27:21] that you know went went sideways shortly
[27:24] after brother branham left
[27:26] and so
[27:27] so really i mean you didn't have this
[27:29] global community of global churches you
[27:32] understand so so so brother branham is
[27:34] obviously not talking to
[27:37] what we have now become
[27:39] global in our footprint message churches
[27:42] because i'm here to tell you we do have
[27:43] the power of god
[27:46] thank god we do have the power of god
[27:49] and it is moving and this this church i
[27:51] could spend the rest of the day and
[27:54] every person in here could stand up and
[27:55] tell some great miracle that god has
[27:58] done even recently
[28:01] see so so so so just just keep this
[28:04] straight but now you say well then why
[28:06] then why bother reading this to us
[28:08] brother jason if he's not even talking
[28:10] to us because the principles of what
[28:13] causes it
[28:15] can affect us
[28:16] and limit god moving
[28:19] even though we have the truth
[28:22] and are preaching the truth
[28:25] see
[28:26] all right
[28:29] i'm gonna just make a statement tip you
[28:31] off a little bit
[28:33] i i hope by the end of today and i don't
[28:35] think i'll get finished
[28:37] i'm gonna i'm watching the clock
[28:42] i hope by the end of today that you can
[28:45] see
[28:46] something greater
[28:48] that we should be pursuing
[28:50] you say you say
[28:52] well you know there's the whole
[28:54] almost like a civil war between
[28:56] intellectualism and emotionalism well
[29:00] there shouldn't be any war for the
[29:01] family of god because both of those are
[29:03] wrong
[29:04] intellectualism
[29:07] emotional
[29:08] ism
[29:09] is just as bad as denominational
[29:13] see
[29:14] so it's it's not all it's not always the
[29:16] people in the dominations it's the
[29:18] system
[29:19] see so now but so so then but then there
[29:23] is
[29:24] there now now listen i'm going to make
[29:26] another turn
[29:27] there absolutely is
[29:30] a very good truth laying in the
[29:32] intellectual study and teaching of god's
[29:35] word
[29:36] teaching's what establishes churches
[29:39] there is also
[29:41] emotion that should be striven for
[29:44] i believe that when you come in here the
[29:48] worship leaders should be prayed up the
[29:50] musicians should be prayed up the people
[29:53] coming should be prayed up there should
[29:55] be an expectation when the worship
[29:57] starts you should raise your hands you
[30:00] should lift your voice
[30:02] there should be great word coming forth
[30:04] balance there should also be and we
[30:06] should strive for both of them
[30:10] amen
[30:13] i'm going to present to you today and
[30:15] hope to prove
[30:16] that there's another element that is
[30:19] superior to even both of those in
[30:22] combination
[30:24] now without those two you would never
[30:26] get to this greater one but because we
[30:29] have the word and because we have the
[30:30] spirit of god
[30:32] now we want to know then what's then
[30:34] what could be possibly brother jason
[30:36] what could possibly be greater
[30:39] than those two things
[30:42] the thing that makes both of them
[30:45] function
[30:47] the thing that makes them work
[30:50] if you don't have that which makes them
[30:52] work yes they're great but you don't
[30:55] have access to them because you don't
[30:57] have that which makes them go
[31:00] it's the it's that's what i'm preaching
[31:02] on today what makes it go
[31:05] all right so i'm tipping you off
[31:10] so now here he is he's showing us these
[31:12] principles
[31:13] all right now we're missing christ
[31:16] amongst our pentecostal
[31:18] people let me get to the correct keep up
[31:20] with myself here
[31:22] our brothers and sisters there is
[31:24] something wrong
[31:27] the old-fashioned prayer meetings they
[31:29] used to have all day and night they
[31:31] don't have them no more
[31:33] our women used to wear long hair they
[31:35] don't do it anymore see so he's not
[31:38] talking to message churches that what we
[31:39] have become as message churches
[31:42] because we do pray and our women don't
[31:44] bob off their hair it would be a
[31:46] disgrace for a woman to paint and use
[31:48] paint
[31:51] back in the early days and act the way
[31:54] these women do something went wrong
[31:57] nothing wrong with christ see but
[32:00] something
[32:01] went wrong
[32:03] something is somewhere
[32:06] all right
[32:07] now watch
[32:08] let's keep moving you know brother ernie
[32:10] used to have a a poignant question that
[32:12] he never got an answer to because nobody
[32:14] was willing to answer it and brother
[32:16] ernie came up through church of god and
[32:18] then upc and then from upc to the
[32:21] message and he come from catholicism to
[32:24] to uh to an evangelical then to church
[32:26] of god then to upc and he's kept
[32:28] graduating graduating until he got to
[32:30] the to the full message and brother
[32:32] ernie goes back and starts talking to
[32:34] those leaders and he says here's brother
[32:36] here's my only question they said oh
[32:37] you've went off the deep end he said
[32:38] okay oh okay i'm off the deep end but
[32:41] please just help me and answer this
[32:42] question now we know by history
[32:45] and none of these men would argue it was
[32:47] very clear in history we know by history
[32:49] that our original pentecostal azusa
[32:52] revival fathers
[32:54] taught that for a woman to cut her hair
[32:56] off was against the scripture it taught
[32:58] that a woman to put on a garment that
[33:00] pertains to a man was against god's
[33:01] bible that's not a william branham
[33:03] doctrine
[33:04] that's a that's a moses doctrine
[33:07] cutting hair is not a william branham
[33:09] doctrine that's a saint paul doctrine
[33:11] all right you'll have a problem with
[33:12] paul and moses not william branham on
[33:14] the other side
[33:15] so so we find he says now they used to
[33:19] say that women shouldn't paint their
[33:21] face up like jezebel we used to our men
[33:24] didn't used to smoke and drink and
[33:26] corrals and curse and gamble and
[33:28] womanize
[33:30] so now
[33:31] they they taught against that see and
[33:34] now everybody's allowed to do it
[33:36] he said so my my simple question is this
[33:40] were we wrong when we started
[33:43] or are we wrong as we're finishing
[33:47] which is it just tell me are did we
[33:49] start wrong or are we finishing wrong
[33:52] and brother ernie got the door quickly
[33:56] they were not interested in even
[33:57] addressing that question but it's a fair
[34:00] question
[34:01] see
[34:02] something went wrong nothing wrong with
[34:04] christ see but something went wrong
[34:06] something is somewhere don't get afraid
[34:08] i'm watching the clock i can feel a
[34:10] little bit of nervousness because i'm
[34:11] going slow i'm not going to go long you
[34:13] all know me i don't do that all right so
[34:15] just sit tight
[34:17] we're learning something right
[34:20] the pulpit used to wouldn't have
[34:22] permitted such a thing as that
[34:24] but it does now see the crisis is on and
[34:28] we're missing something
[34:30] we're missing power that we ought to
[34:32] have so i think we can fairly surmise
[34:35] that if we wanna one of the quickest
[34:37] ways to short-circuit our power is for
[34:40] is for the pulpit to start allowing
[34:42] women to cut their hair wear makeup and
[34:44] pants and men to start drinking cussing
[34:46] corrals and gambling i'd say that would
[34:48] pretty effectively kill the power of god
[34:51] so since i'd rather have the power of
[34:53] god i don't intend to let this pulpit
[34:56] allow that see all right is that okay
[35:00] amen you still want to keep me in
[35:03] all right thank you
[35:06] so
[35:07] now we're missing the power we ought to
[35:08] have where the big machine ought to be
[35:10] running up and great signs and wonders
[35:13] well this building ought to be sitting
[35:16] so full of the power of god now
[35:19] till a sinner couldn't stay in here the
[35:21] holy spirit condemning it right quickly
[35:23] like that like ananias and sapphira and
[35:27] we are missing something
[35:30] goes to the god of this evil age i'm
[35:32] just going i'm going um chronologically
[35:35] but then i'm gonna when i switch gears i
[35:37] got to drop back and then i'll go
[35:38] chronologically again so just hang on
[35:42] uh the god of this evil age now she has
[35:44] caused the whole world to accept the
[35:47] scientific leadership
[35:49] of the educational program that satan
[35:51] has given to her under the name of a
[35:53] church this is the antichrist spirit all
[35:56] right that was prophesied the same bible
[35:58] that prophesied a restoration of the
[36:00] word also prophesied this is the day of
[36:02] the antichrist all right
[36:04] now where he he's always been but this
[36:06] is the day where he really comes into
[36:08] his ride okay now watch
[36:10] and what it what what is the antichrist
[36:13] works through a through a woman it's a
[36:14] church now she has cause because woman
[36:16] in the bible is the church always
[36:19] she has caused the whole world to accept
[36:21] the scientific leadership of the
[36:22] educational program that satan has given
[36:24] to her under the name of a church
[36:27] the leadership of an educational
[36:29] scientific program i'm picturing to you
[36:32] the god of this world so i think we
[36:35] ought to be firmly against approaching
[36:38] the word in an intellectual scientific
[36:41] way
[36:42] i think it ought to still be accompanied
[36:45] by the power and demonstration of the
[36:46] holy spirit and it ought to be preached
[36:49] as a living word
[36:51] see now don't confuse that with
[36:54] bible teaching
[36:56] bible teaching isn't even geared or
[36:58] designed to be to be uh
[37:01] emotional
[37:03] because because when you're you miss it
[37:05] you'll miss the whole lesson that
[37:07] teaching is meant to be brother branham
[37:09] says that in quotes and i've got him if
[37:11] i get to him today he teaches that on
[37:13] tape all right he's comparing the
[37:16] difference between peter being a
[37:17] firebrand because he wasn't a teacher
[37:19] but brother branham says but paul was
[37:21] more scholarly like teaching
[37:24] see
[37:24] so and brother branham says god has many
[37:26] mansions in my father's house are many
[37:28] men she's got all kinds
[37:30] and so i'm opposed to
[37:33] some of our evangelists running around
[37:35] today and like honest to goodness think
[37:38] they're trying to make all the preachers
[37:39] evangelists
[37:42] and if they're not preaching like an
[37:43] evangelist is preaching they must be a
[37:45] psychology
[37:47] man
[37:48] and not called and not gifted
[37:57] anyway not here to get on a rant
[38:02] so
[38:03] when when she as eve had the very
[38:06] filling of god's word in her hand
[38:09] she could have took god's word
[38:12] but what did she do to that instead of
[38:14] tarrying for the baptism of the holy
[38:16] ghost let science prove to her that the
[38:20] holy ghost was only for the disciples
[38:23] see
[38:24] so brother branham says now you've got a
[38:26] little clear understanding when brother
[38:28] branham talks about eve said she would
[38:30] have eventually come to that she would
[38:32] it's that's what the holy ghost eve see
[38:34] when she as eve had the very filling of
[38:37] god's word in her hand which eve had
[38:38] fortified behind the word she would have
[38:40] come to that experience god was
[38:43] progressing to a whole family he's going
[38:46] to build a whole kingdom see all right
[38:48] so
[38:49] so he says he let science prove to her
[38:51] that the holy ghost was only for the
[38:54] disciples
[38:55] instead
[38:57] of keeping divine healing going when she
[39:00] ought to be
[39:02] now raising the dead and doing great
[39:05] miracles she has let satan under his
[39:08] leadership of religious man take the
[39:10] word of god and try to say that it was
[39:12] for another age and she's disbelieved it
[39:15] when the bible says that the things that
[39:18] i do shall you do also jesus said that
[39:22] go into all the world and preach that
[39:23] means to demonstrate
[39:26] the gospel to every creature we're still
[39:28] creatures these signs shall follow every
[39:30] one of them that believe she denies
[39:33] every bit of it
[39:34] so of course this is the remnants of the
[39:37] azusa revival
[39:39] a real message church doesn't deny any
[39:41] of that if it does it's not a message
[39:44] church see
[39:45] it's become a message denomination
[39:48] listen friends you can be followers of
[39:50] the message and not be a believer of the
[39:52] word
[39:54] you absolutely can just because you
[39:56] follow the teachings of the message
[39:57] doesn't mean you're born again see it
[39:59] doesn't even mean that you even believe
[40:01] all the word see
[40:03] so and now so now here here's the sad
[40:06] part oh she denied let's see yeah they
[40:08] can get to that uh instead of keeping so
[40:12] she's leaving and when the bible says
[40:13] things that i do show you also jesus
[40:15] said go you know okay we read that these
[40:17] sons shall follow every one of them that
[40:19] believe
[40:20] she denies every bit of it all right oh
[40:23] i found myself okay she denies
[40:26] all the supernatural
[40:28] and she swapped it for his intellectual
[40:31] conception of the bible so we are firmly
[40:36] adamantly
[40:37] uh
[40:38] diametrically opposed to intellectual
[40:42] conception
[40:44] i am against it i preach against it i
[40:47] preach in a fire-breathing experience of
[40:50] the living god because he's alive and
[40:53] you can know him in a living way
[40:56] see
[40:58] she swapped it for his intellectual
[41:00] conception of the bible
[41:02] where priest and holy father so-called
[41:05] where bishops archbishops or district
[41:07] president presbyters over general
[41:09] overseer and so forth has put their own
[41:11] interpretation to it and god has left
[41:13] them set there dead as twelve o'clock
[41:15] and we can see that
[41:17] all right
[41:18] the only
[41:19] things left in the last days
[41:23] is a bunch of little pentecostals with a
[41:25] bunch of music whooped up as hard as
[41:28] they can
[41:29] run up and down the floors speaking in
[41:32] tongues and shouting i'm all against
[41:34] powerful worship music i'm all for
[41:37] powerful worship music i'm all for the
[41:39] operation of the gifts i'm all for the
[41:41] opera i'd like to i'd like to see all
[41:43] the gifts in operation i'd also like to
[41:45] see all of the of the fruits of the
[41:47] spirit
[41:50] see
[41:51] so if you if you're gonna if you're
[41:53] gonna champion for the gifts champion
[41:55] for the fruits as well
[41:57] of patience and temperance and meekness
[41:59] and holiness and godliness and love
[42:02] kindness amen
[42:04] hallelujah so so so let's let's let's
[42:07] have all of it all right
[42:10] so so he says now this is the only thing
[42:12] they've got left all right and having
[42:14] here now here's what invalidates
[42:17] their music
[42:19] whooped up as hard as they can
[42:22] running up and down the floor speaking
[42:23] tongues shouting saying there's anything
[42:24] wrong with running them down the floor
[42:25] speaking in tongues good music no
[42:27] nothing wrong with that here's what
[42:28] short circuited it having a form of
[42:31] godliness
[42:33] they come to church they you know it's
[42:35] like the old the old tv commercial from
[42:37] way back in the day that i haven't seen
[42:39] in 40 years so i just want to make that
[42:40] clear you know when the guy comes on
[42:42] there and somehow this is supposed to
[42:43] imbibe you with confidence in some drug
[42:45] and he's standing there in a white coat
[42:47] in his glasses and he says
[42:49] i'm not a doctor but i play one on tv
[42:52] and you're supposed to go oh my goodness
[42:54] i got to get that drug
[42:56] and and i i said to the church one time
[42:58] i said you know i don't want to see you
[43:00] walk in here all dressed up you know
[43:02] sharp and dressed to the nines and come
[43:03] in here and say and you know and say i'm
[43:06] not a christian but i play one on
[43:07] sundays
[43:11] i'm not actually a christian but i play
[43:13] one in front of other people see
[43:16] now that's the attitude of the world
[43:19] this is what they did having a form of
[43:21] godliness but denying the word thereof
[43:23] tell them to be baptized in the name of
[43:25] jesus christ laugh in your face but that
[43:28] god goes right on making it so
[43:31] just the same
[43:32] proving his word to be stowed you happy
[43:35] for that
[43:37] says now we are going to use this like a
[43:40] sunday school lesson
[43:42] it's not directed to any uh certain uh
[43:45] anything or any certain person or
[43:47] anything just to the church body now
[43:49] he's coming to the invisible union now
[43:52] now you're about to now you're about to
[43:55] see him start to transition
[43:57] now he's not just
[44:00] making it known here's the problem in
[44:02] the so-called pentecostal churches
[44:05] but now he's going to start
[44:06] transitioning to talk to the bride
[44:09] who who has been come on the scene
[44:12] birthed by the word she was an infant
[44:14] when the seals were open now she's got
[44:16] some mileage under her feet she's
[44:18] growing up and now he's going to start
[44:21] training this bride
[44:23] how to not make the mistake of the of
[44:25] the pentecostal people
[44:27] all right
[44:28] how many want that
[44:31] it's not directed to anything any
[44:33] certain person or anything just to the
[44:34] church the body of christ
[44:36] that we're trying to lead to deeper
[44:40] thoughts and higher objectives believing
[44:42] that the coming of the lord jesus is at
[44:45] hand we believe that much more it's 20
[44:48] years closer than it was the first time
[44:51] i come to shreveport
[44:54] oh so much has happened since that time
[44:58] we're looking forward for the coming of
[45:01] the lord in our generation
[45:04] look at this next line i'm not looking
[45:07] for revival
[45:09] in our generation
[45:12] i'm looking for the coming of the lord
[45:15] in our generation
[45:19] now let me just
[45:21] let me just
[45:22] say this
[45:24] it's obvious by the scriptures and by
[45:26] brother branham's other teaching that
[45:28] brother branham is not doubting revival
[45:32] what what brother branham is saying that
[45:34] we have reached the last age
[45:36] and this is the last call to the gentile
[45:39] church
[45:40] remember it's the gentile church who
[45:42] misses the rapture she goes in the
[45:44] tribulation she's the remnant of the
[45:46] woman's seed
[45:47] only the elect lady goes in the rapture
[45:50] only the bride because the church kicked
[45:53] christ out according to revelation 3 and
[45:56] he's standing on the outside of the
[45:57] church she's no longer his mouthpiece
[45:59] she's become her own mouthpiece and she
[46:02] she oh and what is she intellectualism
[46:05] and emotionalism
[46:07] and that's it's all wind and no sails
[46:09] and it's it's it's it's no way no way to
[46:12] go it's completely out of order it's
[46:14] upside down and the power of god has
[46:15] abandoned them
[46:17] say do they have miracles not the
[46:19] greatest one
[46:21] the greatest miracle is to change life
[46:24] the greatest miracle is to reach into a
[46:26] realm that no power can reach down into
[46:29] the soul and activate a gene of god
[46:33] and that power is missing once that
[46:35] power hits and you have that and it
[46:38] brings that gene to life i'll promise
[46:40] you signs and wonders and miracles and
[46:42] the power of god will follow that
[46:47] you won't have to work it up
[46:49] see
[46:50] we've seen that by experience
[46:53] so he he's certainly not he's certainly
[46:56] not saying
[46:57] he's certainly not saying
[47:00] when i'm not looking for a revival in
[47:01] our generation i'm looking for the
[47:02] coming of the lord he's he's not saying
[47:05] go down to the pier because the old ship
[47:08] of zion is coming go down there and sit
[47:10] on your luggage
[47:13] amen because the revival's over
[47:15] what he's saying is is that the age is
[47:17] coming to an end and the next revival
[47:20] there's a revival coming but it's going
[47:21] to israel to the jews once the bride is
[47:24] gone
[47:25] you're clear see
[47:28] so he's saying now and then also you can
[47:31] infer in this statement by his other
[47:34] teachings by everything he said
[47:37] that what we have
[47:38] why why
[47:40] why wh why are we not going to get
[47:42] another
[47:43] outpouring of the holy spirit brother
[47:44] brown talks about a fresh surge and a
[47:46] refilling i believe it will be a
[47:48] refilling of the baptism of the holy
[47:49] ghost of course all of those things are
[47:51] to us but it's all contained in the word
[47:54] and it's all contained in the promises
[47:56] i'm preaching today about what is
[47:58] hindering some of those promises
[48:01] you know it's the fresh surge of the
[48:04] holy spirit is not somewhere over the
[48:06] rainbow
[48:08] the the the latter rain is not somewhere
[48:10] over the rainbow that the opening of the
[48:13] word is the former and latter rain
[48:15] moderately coming in the same month
[48:17] once you have of a field that has come
[48:21] back to grain which we have
[48:24] and then the august then that then the
[48:26] you you get what's called a harvest rain
[48:29] that's the anointing of christ coming
[48:32] down on his word through a prophet and
[48:34] breaking the bread of life and it
[48:35] becomes the living bread the living
[48:38] water
[48:39] and he says i'm not looking for another
[48:40] revival of course not because every
[48:42] wheat farmer knows once you've had the
[48:44] harvest rain what does that do that
[48:46] pushes the the grain now to ripen
[48:50] see it's green but now it's got to ripen
[48:52] it's got to lay in the presence of the
[48:54] sun and if you have another rain you
[48:56] ruin that crop
[48:59] you don't want another rain
[49:02] you need to harvest it before the next
[49:05] rain
[49:06] see
[49:07] so so we know we're not looking for rain
[49:11] after the harvest ladder rain because
[49:12] it'll ruin the crop and so it became
[49:15] clear
[49:17] that a bride who would believe every
[49:19] word of god
[49:20] would have to be called out of the
[49:22] systems of man-made organization because
[49:26] those powers are to be working
[49:29] in he or she who believes these signs
[49:34] shall
[49:35] follow them amen
[49:38] so the power to bring life to a gene
[49:41] the the power the power of the
[49:43] supernatural to heal the sick and open
[49:44] blinded eyes and raise the dead and
[49:46] joyce say do we have that power sure we
[49:48] have that power i've seen that power
[49:51] operate i've seen miracles right
[49:52] standing right here i've across the
[49:55] ocean and seen the same kind of miracles
[49:57] we've got brothers who report on on a
[50:00] regular basis the dead being raised
[50:03] that's not hard uh for for god to do
[50:07] see
[50:09] all right so then so then where does
[50:11] what does it come to all right now watch
[50:14] he's really starting to zero in
[50:17] now i'm gonna take my my my last
[50:20] 21 minutes all right
[50:22] and if i don't finish we'll just push
[50:23] pause
[50:24] and we'll jump out and pull the chute
[50:26] and land and we'll catch up to you
[50:28] wednesday or not it won't be me but next
[50:30] sunday
[50:32] so he says here
[50:36] i believe
[50:38] that's the same thing we live in today
[50:42] god bearing record this is things that
[50:44] are to be
[50:46] god bearing record of his word
[50:48] by vindicating what he said he would do
[50:51] now we know
[50:54] that this is the day of salvation
[50:57] where god is calling men from the world
[51:00] from a life of sin
[51:02] unto a life of service
[51:04] and in the day that god has poured out
[51:07] his spirit from on high
[51:09] great signs and wonders are to accompany
[51:11] the ministry of this day
[51:13] this is when the former and latter rain
[51:16] are falling together
[51:18] and we know that there is supposed to be
[51:21] great signs and wonders which in many
[51:24] great denominations this is turned down
[51:28] communion come as his lat one of his
[51:30] last his last sermon actually
[51:33] you know the hour will soon arise
[51:36] when right among us the holy spirit will
[51:39] speak out like it did in ananias and
[51:41] sapphira
[51:43] remember see the hour is arriving now
[51:45] you just remember that
[51:47] and god is going to dwell among his
[51:50] people that's what he wants to do now
[51:54] all right
[51:55] all right now
[51:58] let me take you to this to this quote
[51:59] here
[52:01] and i
[52:02] i made a statement here i'm going to
[52:04] read this very quickly and from here i'm
[52:06] going to really try to speed up
[52:08] so brother branham says
[52:10] in the god of this evil age
[52:14] okay now we're coming to laying this is
[52:16] the section now i want to come to today
[52:18] and this is where i'm going to take my
[52:19] last 18 minutes
[52:21] laying in the presence of the sun
[52:23] now i tipped you off
[52:26] we must have good bible fundamental
[52:29] instruction and teaching and it must
[52:32] deal
[52:33] with
[52:34] baptism and the serpent seed and
[52:36] election and husbands and children and
[52:39] finances
[52:42] it must it must identify false anointed
[52:44] ones it must identify the indictment
[52:47] amen
[52:48] it's all of that it's all the seventh
[52:50] seal see
[52:51] but we must also strive to bring
[52:55] you know it's it's worth it
[52:57] i want to say to brother anthony and to
[52:59] all of the other worship leaders that
[53:01] fill in
[53:03] that it's worth it
[53:05] to come out here and push the people
[53:08] it's worth it to come out prayed up it's
[53:10] worth it musicians
[53:11] it's worth it for you to meet back there
[53:13] early and be practiced and be ready and
[53:16] be inspired come out here because you're
[53:18] part you're welcoming the presence of
[53:20] almighty god
[53:21] we're not here just for our uh uh we're
[53:24] not here for just a jericho march we're
[53:26] here to welcome the presence of god if
[53:28] that breaks into a jericho march glory
[53:30] be to god ain't seen one of those in a
[53:33] while
[53:34] but i'm here to tell you it's worth it
[53:36] when you have young people listen let me
[53:39] defend it a little bit it's worth it
[53:41] when you have young people who are over
[53:44] who are just deluged their senses are
[53:46] deluged
[53:48] every kind of screen in front of their
[53:50] eyes and every kind of spectacular
[53:53] unbelievable you know computer animation
[53:55] and every you you can't you can't ima
[53:58] you can't amaze americans by anything
[54:01] had a russian sister say that to me one
[54:02] time said it very sincerely trying to
[54:04] give me a little simple handmade gift
[54:06] she said i know you can't amaze
[54:07] americans by anything but my mother and
[54:09] i we made this wanted you to have it and
[54:11] i took it and i just thought about that
[54:12] statement i thought that is so true and
[54:15] and and you and your brothers and
[54:16] everywhere we go and it's in mcdonald's
[54:18] in walmart it's everywhere it's on the
[54:20] streets you pull up to a light it's
[54:21] everywhere your your senses are
[54:23] assaulted and and so you you naturally
[54:26] it i'm here to tell you it takes
[54:28] something to come out here and say come
[54:30] on clap your hands come on come on get
[54:33] them clapping come on tap those feet
[54:35] come on let's sing come on and you hear
[54:36] the song they're saying lift up your
[54:38] hands why does he have to say that
[54:39] because you need to hear it
[54:42] so there it's it's value
[54:44] i i see the value in in in in a youth
[54:48] camp where they're trying to where
[54:50] they're trying to arouse the young
[54:52] people because what they're trying to
[54:54] say oh it's just a pep rally sometimes
[54:56] it is but don't discount the value
[55:00] don't discount the value that you
[55:01] sometimes they come from churches where
[55:03] they just sit like statues and nobody's
[55:05] afraid to move and you got to get them
[55:07] moving and get the blood going and come
[55:09] on get get them past their awkward teeny
[55:11] awkwardness and get them worshipping god
[55:14] go back three or four days later at the
[55:16] end of it and those who were standing
[55:17] there like this now they're raising
[55:19] their hands and now they're praising god
[55:21] now say what does that do for them that
[55:23] activates their faith so they can
[55:24] believe the word of god
[55:27] so don't be against that for the sake of
[55:30] being against it
[55:32] there's value in that
[55:35] but see but then but then don't
[55:37] disparage the man who just comes with a
[55:39] fundamental lesson to teach some
[55:42] principle about the word of god
[55:45] see
[55:47] as if there's some fight between those
[55:48] i'm here to tell you there's no fight in
[55:50] the holy ghost
[55:51] he's he's about both of those
[55:54] see
[55:57] so
[55:58] too often times it's immature preachers
[56:00] creating a fight where there's not
[56:01] really a fight
[56:04] see so
[56:04] [Music]
[56:07] i shouldn't have said that i apologize i
[56:08] don't want to disparage anything or
[56:10] anybody
[56:12] but there is no
[56:15] fight in the holy ghost
[56:17] we read
[56:18] that's the thing that will keep the
[56:20] gifts from working
[56:22] that
[56:23] division
[56:24] is what will hinder the holy spirit from
[56:27] working
[56:28] oh i to move on so brother branham says
[56:31] here oh i want to say this
[56:33] so now
[56:34] here is that middle part that i told you
[56:37] that makes this side and this side work
[56:41] they're both great
[56:43] the intellectual concepts of the word
[56:45] and teaching the deep things of god or
[56:47] teaching about families and finances and
[56:50] children these things are fundamental
[56:52] truths
[56:54] and then the the free-flowing worship
[56:56] and the electric atmospheres of the holy
[56:58] ghost these are all part of god's plan
[57:02] but the thing that makes them work
[57:05] properly
[57:08] is laying in the presence
[57:10] of the sun
[57:13] that's why i titled this series in the
[57:15] presence of the s-o-n
[57:18] say what does that even mean lay in the
[57:20] presence of the sun you're going to see
[57:22] it's more than a cliche all right i got
[57:24] a few minutes left hang on
[57:26] all right
[57:28] just as your natural life and traits is
[57:30] handed down from the natural breeding of
[57:32] your father so is the spirit of god that
[57:33] was predestined before the foundation of
[57:34] the world when the entire word of god is
[57:37] complete was headed up in a human body
[57:38] called jesus christ in there i love this
[57:41] god made me pay for my sins in him there
[57:43] so it's done settled you're free
[57:46] that's it you're free you're done that's
[57:47] it you're free
[57:48] and whatever you've ever done whatever
[57:50] you're guilty of today what you might
[57:51] stumble in tomorrow it's over it's done
[57:54] god has already made you pay for your
[57:57] sins in christ at calvary
[58:01] that's finished don't let the devil keep
[58:03] hindering you from that see
[58:06] then he rose me raised me up with him in
[58:11] the resurrection
[58:13] and now
[58:14] we are seated with him with power and
[58:16] authority over every devil oh if you
[58:18] could only believe what god has given
[58:20] watch this now but if you're not seated
[58:22] there you don't have it and if you're
[58:23] seated there
[58:25] if you're seated there and don't believe
[58:27] it and afraid to move you'll never use
[58:29] it
[58:30] [Music]
[58:31] so why that's why we need fundamental
[58:33] teaching that's why because teaching
[58:35] teaches you how to use it that's why we
[58:38] need some emotion i don't like anything
[58:40] dead i want to see it preached in power
[58:42] received in power rejoiced in over with
[58:46] power
[58:48] see and that's what'll make it function
[58:52] but if you're seated there you will use
[58:54] it for your ordain to do what you do and
[58:56] i said to you a couple services ago so
[58:58] whatever the lord needs to do to get you
[59:00] in position he'll use whatever means
[59:02] necessary
[59:04] he'll use whatever means are necessary
[59:06] see
[59:07] and uh might be some rough water
[59:10] but just remember when it comes to his
[59:12] family god sends god allows judgment on
[59:15] his family but it's always to to invoke
[59:17] repentance
[59:19] it's never to punish god can't punish
[59:22] you for what christ already was punished
[59:24] for
[59:26] christ was already punished for anything
[59:28] you'd ever do wrong but what he does do
[59:31] is allow judgments to come on your life
[59:33] to invoke repentance so that you'll come
[59:35] back and say father i'm sorry forgive me
[59:37] please help me see
[59:41] so so then he goes on i gotta i gotta go
[59:43] fast
[59:44] now he says i'm coming to you
[59:47] with a message
[59:51] that that sign vindicated what what did
[59:53] the church no it never denominated but
[59:56] what happened to the denominations over
[59:58] this revival what did they do
[1:00:00] they went straight into laodicea
[1:00:03] millions and millions and billions of
[1:00:05] dollars poured into it and she's just a
[1:00:08] big bunch of
[1:00:10] big and rich and she builds million
[1:00:12] dollars worth of property and things
[1:00:13] like that and to receive the message no
[1:00:16] indeedy they turn it away what is it the
[1:00:18] husk pulling away from the wheat see
[1:00:22] the husk is pulling away that he says
[1:00:25] now the he um
[1:00:27] because i added that in there he says
[1:00:29] the husk from away from the wheat
[1:00:31] meaning she's pulling away he says it
[1:00:33] correctly several other times
[1:00:36] all right so he says
[1:00:37] it's the husk pulling away now the wheat
[1:00:40] must be that way
[1:00:42] so you have to be rejected of the world
[1:00:44] you had to come out of them
[1:00:46] had to get clear of that see
[1:00:49] the wheat must be that way to lay in the
[1:00:51] presence of the sun to turn to a full
[1:00:53] gospel golden grain for the master
[1:00:55] that's the reason that's why you have to
[1:00:57] separate from friends
[1:00:59] sometimes even associates and things in
[1:01:01] the world that's why you can't you can't
[1:01:04] play
[1:01:05] you know too closely with even nominal
[1:01:08] christian friends say but they're good
[1:01:10] people of course they are they might
[1:01:12] make it to heaven for all i know if they
[1:01:14] believe in christ the son of god they'll
[1:01:15] make it to heaven see they the god
[1:01:18] there's a remnant of the woman's seed in
[1:01:19] the the new heavens and the new earth
[1:01:21] and even the millennium will be filled
[1:01:23] with millions of people who never knew
[1:01:25] anything about this message never
[1:01:26] believed it at all even heard it and
[1:01:27] rejected it and will still end up there
[1:01:30] but what i'm saying to you is you can't
[1:01:32] run too close into that circle because
[1:01:35] that prevents you from laying in the
[1:01:37] presence of the sun
[1:01:39] because you're always you know under
[1:01:41] this pressure and peer pressure to kind
[1:01:43] of compromise in your life and when
[1:01:44] you're living a compromised life now
[1:01:47] you're not laying in the presence of the
[1:01:50] sun see
[1:01:54] so he says you're a man running from the
[1:01:56] presence of the lord now i'm giving you
[1:01:58] that middle tool that makes this side
[1:02:00] and this side work in balance
[1:02:05] but the wheat has to lay in the presence
[1:02:07] of the sun to ripen
[1:02:08] and that's what we're here for friends
[1:02:10] stay
[1:02:11] in the presence of the sun till our
[1:02:13] little group of people here till it
[1:02:15] becomes so ripe to christ it become
[1:02:18] bread on his table that's what i want to
[1:02:20] do that's what i want to do
[1:02:22] see
[1:02:23] this is what keeps these balanced
[1:02:27] if you don't have this you might have
[1:02:29] these but they'll be
[1:02:31] they'll be all out of balance it's it's
[1:02:34] this is what brings them together this
[1:02:36] is the key
[1:02:38] a lot of people love deep teaching and a
[1:02:41] lot of people love to run the aisles but
[1:02:43] when it comes to the surrendered
[1:02:46] life
[1:02:48] to lay before god and separate from the
[1:02:52] world and get rid of all the loyalty sin
[1:02:54] poisons and toxins
[1:02:57] that's where people start to struggle
[1:03:01] see
[1:03:03] that
[1:03:05] is the most important thing
[1:03:08] this is the most important thing
[1:03:13] this invalidates the argument of of
[1:03:17] teaching versus demotion
[1:03:19] it makes it renders that argument silly
[1:03:24] it makes that argument ridiculous
[1:03:27] and and if one side is attacking this
[1:03:29] side or this side's attacking this side
[1:03:31] they're all
[1:03:32] ding-dongs
[1:03:36] they're missing the point
[1:03:39] what people need is consecrated lives
[1:03:42] now you have the power of god moving
[1:03:45] it's not about how fast you can whip up
[1:03:47] the music or how deep an intellectual
[1:03:49] you can teach it none of that stuff will
[1:03:50] stay in balance if you don't have a
[1:03:52] surrendered heart and a clean mind
[1:03:56] before god
[1:03:59] see
[1:04:00] bread on his table oh look at eight
[1:04:03] minutes
[1:04:04] christ is revealed in his own word
[1:04:06] the thing that's the matter with the
[1:04:10] message today now we're not talking
[1:04:12] about the
[1:04:13] pentecostal churches now we're talking
[1:04:15] about the message
[1:04:17] the thing that's the matter with the
[1:04:19] message today
[1:04:21] is
[1:04:22] is people uh you know don't like emotion
[1:04:27] oh i'm sorry let me start over the thing
[1:04:29] that's the matter with the message today
[1:04:31] is people you know they they don't like
[1:04:34] deep teaching
[1:04:39] the problem is it's those who
[1:04:41] obtain it in their hearts must lay in
[1:04:44] the presence of the sun to get ripened
[1:04:48] you can pick up the message and then
[1:04:53] let the sun
[1:04:54] bake all the greenness out of you see
[1:04:57] making matured christians see what i
[1:04:59] mean god is coming soon to receive his
[1:05:01] church and we must have that type of
[1:05:02] christians for him to receive the wheat
[1:05:05] has to get ripe the wheat has to get
[1:05:09] ripe
[1:05:11] see
[1:05:13] invisible union
[1:05:16] it's the grain
[1:05:18] it can't go no further
[1:05:20] we're at the end time so what does it
[1:05:22] have to do now
[1:05:24] lay in the presence of the sun to be
[1:05:26] ripened that's exactly
[1:05:29] the word to be ripened in your heart to
[1:05:32] bring forth and live what we're talking
[1:05:35] about amen
[1:05:38] why in the world
[1:05:40] as a preacher
[1:05:42] would i spend five seconds
[1:05:45] filling your minds with fighting words
[1:05:48] attacking some other kind of a movement
[1:05:51] oh they're against pentecostal oh well
[1:05:53] all they are is pentecostal bethel
[1:05:55] tabernacle stay out of that
[1:05:58] be spiritual switzerland and just stay
[1:06:01] neutral and say i got one motive and i
[1:06:04] want to lay in the presence of the son
[1:06:07] that's what i want to teach my young
[1:06:08] people that's what i want to teach
[1:06:09] married people
[1:06:11] we want the deeper things of god but we
[1:06:13] want the power of god moving and there's
[1:06:15] a way there's a truth and a way to have
[1:06:18] that accomplished and it comes by
[1:06:20] balanced fundamentals of teaching both
[1:06:22] sides believing both sides and pressing
[1:06:25] for both sides
[1:06:29] see
[1:06:31] i'd catch a preacher preaching that in
[1:06:33] our youth camp he would never preach
[1:06:35] again at my youth camp
[1:06:37] all rilling the people up
[1:06:40] and and and getting young people just
[1:06:42] angry and getting old people angry
[1:06:44] i mean my goodness what do you want
[1:06:46] what's everybody gonna do i mean we got
[1:06:48] these message gangs
[1:06:50] they're just message gangs
[1:06:52] some of them got a thug mentality
[1:06:54] and sometimes i see things go on and i
[1:06:56] say what are they trying to do get their
[1:06:58] gang to everybody grab their spiritual
[1:07:00] switchblades and baseball bats and let's
[1:07:02] hit the streets and have a rumble let's
[1:07:04] go attack the other message gang
[1:07:07] where's the love of god you're never
[1:07:08] going to have the power of god moving
[1:07:11] [Applause]
[1:07:12] that's that's wrong that's imbalanced
[1:07:14] that's immature i'm here to tell you
[1:07:17] bride is getting ready for a body change
[1:07:21] glory to god
[1:07:25] all right i got four and a half minutes
[1:07:28] you got a seat belt on
[1:07:30] you're gonna need it
[1:07:36] the invisible union it's it it's the
[1:07:39] grain it can't go no further we're at
[1:07:40] the end time
[1:07:43] see
[1:07:44] we're at the uh we're at the um
[1:07:47] we're at the end time so what does it
[1:07:49] have to do now
[1:07:53] push for more emotion
[1:07:56] teach deeper things
[1:07:58] form more camps
[1:08:01] attack the other camps
[1:08:04] what does it have to do
[1:08:06] lay in the presence of the sun
[1:08:09] to be ripened
[1:08:10] that's exactly
[1:08:12] the word to be ripened in your heart
[1:08:16] to bring forth and live
[1:08:19] what we're talking about
[1:08:27] whoops
[1:08:28] as far as we'll go today you can take it
[1:08:29] down
[1:08:30] matt
[1:08:35] if ripeness
[1:08:39] is missing
[1:08:43] you'll misrepresent
[1:08:45] the acts of the spirit
[1:08:49] i'm going to be real deliberative with
[1:08:51] my
[1:08:52] two and a half minutes and two minutes
[1:08:54] of overtime
[1:08:59] if ripeness is missing
[1:09:02] you'll misinterpret
[1:09:04] the acts of the spirit
[1:09:07] and you operate
[1:09:09] gifts in the wrong way
[1:09:10] and you'll push for the wrong things in
[1:09:13] a in a fit of imbalance
[1:09:16] and every minister is supposed to take
[1:09:18] the spiritual hippocratic oath to do no
[1:09:21] harm
[1:09:22] because we are doctors
[1:09:24] i i have a different kind of a medical
[1:09:26] book than doc meredith has or dr andrew
[1:09:29] i have a different medical book than
[1:09:30] they have but we do the same job one
[1:09:32] does it physically out one does it
[1:09:33] spiritually
[1:09:36] you'd be surprised how many times we
[1:09:38] confer notes and go yeah i've had that
[1:09:40] problem well here's what i did about it
[1:09:42] you might try it in the natural it might
[1:09:43] work and come back to me it worked
[1:09:44] perfect
[1:09:46] and then i might be calling them what do
[1:09:47] you do about a case like this well okay
[1:09:49] i'll try that spiritually and boom it
[1:09:51] worked call it back up it worked
[1:09:56] ripeness
[1:09:58] by laying in the presence of the sun
[1:10:01] it facilitates
[1:10:03] or it it it makes the way
[1:10:06] for the proper operation
[1:10:09] of the power of god
[1:10:11] ripeness
[1:10:13] laying in the presence of the sun
[1:10:16] ripeness makes the way
[1:10:19] for the proper functioning
[1:10:21] of the gifts of the spirit of god
[1:10:25] you'll always get out of balance
[1:10:27] operating the gifts if you have
[1:10:30] immature unripeness
[1:10:35] ripeness facilitates or it makes the way
[1:10:39] for gifts
[1:10:41] of the holy ghost
[1:10:42] to operate in correct biblical order
[1:10:48] ripeness
[1:10:49] makes the way
[1:10:51] for the fruit of the spirit to flow
[1:10:53] through you unhindered
[1:10:57] because you're dead your thinking is
[1:11:00] gone you've surrendered you want you've
[1:11:02] laid in the presence till the mind of
[1:11:04] christ has so permeated you
[1:11:09] you are you you become a conduit how
[1:11:11] many want to be a conduit for the gifts
[1:11:14] of the spirit the the the fruits of the
[1:11:18] spirit you want to be a conduit for the
[1:11:20] fruits of the spirit
[1:11:22] i'm here to tell you you'll do more for
[1:11:24] your teenagers you'll do more for your
[1:11:27] lost family members you'll do more for
[1:11:29] your next door neighbors you'll do more
[1:11:31] for your boss or your employees if you
[1:11:33] are an unfattered conduit
[1:11:36] of the spirit of almighty god
[1:11:41] it doesn't take deeper teaching to get
[1:11:43] that nor does it take emphasizing all
[1:11:45] kinds of emotion what it takes is laying
[1:11:48] in the presence of the sun
[1:11:52] ripeness makes the way for the token to
[1:11:56] be on display
[1:11:58] amen
[1:11:59] thank you mom makes the way
[1:12:01] for the token to be on display
[1:12:04] to the world
[1:12:06] properly
[1:12:08] a lot of times people think the only
[1:12:10] token i have to display is god sent a
[1:12:12] prophet
[1:12:12] well what you're supposed to display is
[1:12:15] that jesus christ has come back to the
[1:12:17] earth again and is living in his people
[1:12:20] that's what you say well how did that
[1:12:21] happen by a prophet through a prophetic
[1:12:23] ministry
[1:12:24] but that's that's the vehicle that's
[1:12:26] what god did the the whole thing is now
[1:12:28] christ in you the hope of glory
[1:12:33] ripeness is you listen friends i'm i'm
[1:12:36] closing
[1:12:38] ripeness i'm on my last point just let
[1:12:40] me make it thoroughly can i
[1:12:43] ripeness is you is you
[1:12:47] allowing
[1:12:49] the holy ghost to
[1:12:51] add to your faith virtue and divert your
[1:12:54] knowledge and to knowledge temperance
[1:12:56] and to temperance patience and to
[1:12:58] patience godliness and to godliness
[1:13:00] brotherly kindness and to brotherly
[1:13:02] kindness charity for if these things be
[1:13:06] in you
[1:13:07] and abound
[1:13:09] if you've been laying in the presence of
[1:13:11] the sun and with ripeness they're
[1:13:12] abounding
[1:13:14] they make you
[1:13:16] not help you they make you that ye shall
[1:13:19] neither be barren nor unfruitful in the
[1:13:22] knowledge of our lord jesus christ but
[1:13:25] he
[1:13:26] that has not laid in the presence of the
[1:13:29] son
[1:13:30] he who is not ripe but he that lack of
[1:13:34] these things is blind cannot see afar
[1:13:38] off and has forgotten that he was purged
[1:13:40] from his old sins so you're always
[1:13:42] living a life of reactionary you're
[1:13:44] always reacting because you don't have
[1:13:46] any vision you don't you don't see seeds
[1:13:48] of discrepancy in your home you let them
[1:13:50] all in the door your children get
[1:13:51] polluted by it and the next thing you
[1:13:53] know you're dealing with a crisis that
[1:13:54] you should have saw coming
[1:13:57] you find carnality in your lives and
[1:13:59] parents and sometimes can be the worst
[1:14:01] examples to their children or the best
[1:14:03] examples to their children
[1:14:06] and all the preaching i can do till the
[1:14:08] cows come home cannot save your children
[1:14:12] if you're living an opposite life of
[1:14:14] what i'm preaching
[1:14:17] we're all in this thing
[1:14:21] together
[1:14:24] it's all for one and one for all see
[1:14:30] so if these things
[1:14:33] are not in our lives and abounding
[1:14:40] if they're not abounding
[1:14:43] then what are we not
[1:14:46] letting the word
[1:14:48] do
[1:14:49] in us
[1:14:51] because you have to let the mind amen
[1:14:54] which was in christ be in you
[1:14:57] you have to let
[1:15:00] the word
[1:15:01] dwell in you
[1:15:02] richly
[1:15:05] paul said that to believers
[1:15:08] who had been believers for 30 years
[1:15:11] full of the holy ghost
[1:15:13] paul speaking to people
[1:15:15] with the holy ghost experience said i
[1:15:17] want you to know all the fullness
[1:15:21] wait a minute you mean there's more than
[1:15:22] the holy ghost there's the fullness of
[1:15:24] the holy ghost living through you
[1:15:26] unfettered
[1:15:27] now you're christ in flesh
[1:15:30] that's the whole purpose of the message
[1:15:34] that's why it came that's why we're here
[1:15:37] that's why you believe
[1:15:41] so if these things are not in our lives
[1:15:44] and abounding then we are not letting
[1:15:46] the word what then what are it's a
[1:15:48] question
[1:15:49] then what are we not letting the word do
[1:15:52] in us i had to ask myself that same
[1:15:53] question i'm the one wrote it on my
[1:15:55] notes
[1:15:56] and i typed it out and sat back and
[1:15:58] stared at it jason what are you not
[1:16:00] letting the word do in you
[1:16:02] so i want to see more power and
[1:16:04] demonstration the holy ghost i want to
[1:16:05] have more overcoming victory i want to i
[1:16:07] want to see the power of god in prayer
[1:16:08] well then then it's here the word
[1:16:10] promises it should be here then what am
[1:16:12] i not letting the word accomplish
[1:16:17] what in your daily life is blocking
[1:16:19] those precious promises from operating
[1:16:22] in you
[1:16:24] i told you better have a seatbelt on
[1:16:27] we know
[1:16:30] i'm in overtime i know i'm promising i'm
[1:16:31] on my last notes just hold on i got
[1:16:33] about that that many lines
[1:16:37] we know
[1:16:39] that we are in the time of these things
[1:16:43] to be fully operational
[1:16:46] if you don't if you don't understand
[1:16:47] bible prophecy
[1:16:49] then come see me
[1:16:51] we know we're in the time that they
[1:16:53] should be fully operational
[1:16:56] we know we have a vindicated message
[1:17:00] it's beyond question
[1:17:03] and we can see
[1:17:06] that the key is not just good teaching
[1:17:09] that we strive for
[1:17:11] and rightly so we strive for it rightly
[1:17:14] so rightly so we strive for it
[1:17:18] but we can see that the key is not just
[1:17:22] good teaching
[1:17:23] that we rightly strive for nor
[1:17:27] is the key emotional atmospheres that we
[1:17:30] rightly strive for
[1:17:35] nothing almost nothing upsets me more
[1:17:37] than to be trying to lead worship and
[1:17:40] people look like a brother donnie says
[1:17:42] uh
[1:17:43] not a a not on a log or a bump on a
[1:17:46] pickle is that it brad
[1:17:48] boom pickle
[1:17:50] think about that bubs we like pickles me
[1:17:52] and noah and sister gene
[1:17:55] we love pickles don't we mom i don't
[1:17:56] want us to be a bump on a pickle
[1:17:58] a not on a log listen friends we want to
[1:18:01] be in the stature of a perfect man not a
[1:18:03] statue
[1:18:05] we got enough statues
[1:18:09] we can see that it's not just good
[1:18:13] teaching that we strive for or emotional
[1:18:14] atmospheres that we strive for the key
[1:18:17] to the supernatural is being born again
[1:18:19] and laying in the presence of the sun so
[1:18:23] so
[1:18:25] so when we having said all that so when
[1:18:27] we don't see
[1:18:30] the supernatural in our midst
[1:18:35] or if we don't see overcoming power in
[1:18:38] our lives
[1:18:40] then it begs the question what are we
[1:18:43] laying in the presence of
[1:18:46] what are you you're supposed to be
[1:18:48] laying in the presence of the s-o-n
[1:18:51] and that brings these promises to past
[1:18:54] so just ask yourself this question if
[1:18:56] you don't see the overcoming power of
[1:18:58] god in your life then what are you
[1:19:00] spending your time laying in the
[1:19:01] presence of that's obviously not the
[1:19:04] s-o-n
[1:19:08] i'm afraid
[1:19:10] it's too often
[1:19:12] too many other things
[1:19:14] overlaying
[1:19:16] in the presence
[1:19:18] of the sun
[1:19:20] i'll say it again i'm afraid that it's
[1:19:22] too often
[1:19:24] too many times
[1:19:26] we are laying in the presence
[1:19:28] of other things
[1:19:31] instead of laying our lives
[1:19:34] in the presence of the sun
[1:19:37] amen brother anthony bring your team
[1:19:39] brother
[1:19:41] bow your heads right where you sit just
[1:19:43] stay seated and bow your heads
[1:19:49] too often times
[1:19:53] we find ourselves laying
[1:19:56] in the presence of
[1:19:58] other things
[1:20:02] have thine own way lord dab please have
[1:20:05] thine own way thou art the potter i am
[1:20:07] the clay
[1:20:08] just softly
[1:20:13] there's a lot more that i want to say
[1:20:15] and we will say
[1:20:17] as we continue to
[1:20:19] open this up
[1:20:21] but i know i have enough
[1:20:23] discernment in me to know today that
[1:20:26] like me
[1:20:27] you felt very penetrated by the word of
[1:20:29] god
[1:20:34] like me
[1:20:36] you may be sitting in the presence of
[1:20:38] god right now and
[1:20:39] you're aware you've got a
[1:20:41] you've got a photo
[1:20:43] album
[1:20:44] of yourself
[1:20:47] and
[1:20:48] all the time you're spending
[1:20:50] laying in the presence of this thing or
[1:20:53] that thing or this other thing or that
[1:20:56] other thing and
[1:20:58] somehow laying in the presence of the
[1:21:00] sun
[1:21:01] all heads bowed all eyes closed please
[1:21:05] somehow that
[1:21:06] laying in the presence of the sun
[1:21:09] has fallen down the list of priorities
[1:21:13] now you know
[1:21:15] you know the holy spirit's got your
[1:21:16] number you know he does

[1:21:30] lord why don't you raise up your hands
[1:21:32] i'm going to put both of mine up
[1:21:34] because i can find too many areas in my
[1:21:36] life
[1:21:38] where i have not laid in the presence of
[1:21:40] the sun and i don't see the power and
[1:21:42] overcoming strength that i feel i need
[1:21:45] or know i should have i know this
[1:21:47] message is true my goodness hands are
