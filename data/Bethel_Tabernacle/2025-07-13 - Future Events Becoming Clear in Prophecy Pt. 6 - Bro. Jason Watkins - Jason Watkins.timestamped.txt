[7:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[7:32] &gt;&gt; Your chains gone this morning.
[7:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. I needed somebody to break the
[7:36] chain, especially after Sunday school
[7:38] like that. being a leader. How many
[7:41] times you failed?
[7:44] But thank God he didn't. And he took
[7:46] that prize. He took it all the way to
[7:47] Calvary
[7:49] because you couldn't do it. And neither
[7:51] could I. Amen. Want to remember Sister
[7:54] Melissa this morning. She's visiting her
[7:56] mom. She is in the hospital. She's home
[8:00] now, but she's over there with her
[8:02] family and stuff. So, I want to remember
[8:03] her this morning.
[8:06] And um my son now, you know, when I gave
[8:10] my heart to the Lord, I was a party
[8:13] animal is what they would call. I drank,
[8:15] I smoked,
[8:17] did things that no Christian should be
[8:19] doing. But once I gave my heart to the
[8:22] Lord, it all disappeared
[8:25] one day, one moment. And my son um since
[8:31] he was early teenager, 15 16 has
[8:35] rebelled.
[8:36] He went out thinking that this isn't the
[8:39] life for him. He's 36 years old now.
[8:43] And he went through um rehab in LA for
[8:47] like 7 months. This was almost a year
[8:49] ago or so.
[8:51] And the first day he get out free going
[8:53] to North Dakota, he stopped at a motel,
[8:56] drunk himself into ICU
[8:58] after 7 months.
[9:00] So I went visit him. He got recovered
[9:03] from that and he continued up to North
[9:05] Dakota where he had a job.
[9:08] Um he as far as drinking goes, he was
[9:12] doing okay, but he can't handle people.
[9:16] Got four jobs up there, four good jobs.
[9:19] Um
[9:21] he'd probably been sober about six,
[9:23] seven months working at this job and he
[9:26] met a girl up there in church. She's a
[9:30] woman preacher by the way, but he's back
[9:34] in LA. Went back yesterday
[9:37] back to the same rehab place which
[9:40] basically
[9:41] um they don't let you do anything and
[9:44] they're checking you every day to make
[9:45] sure you're not drinking.
[9:48] you know, talking to brother Dale, and
[9:50] Dale was a mess before he gave his heart
[9:52] to the Lord. And it took one day, one
[9:55] moment in time, same as me. But he just
[10:00] keeps continuing thinking he's somehow
[10:03] going to do this on his own.
[10:06] And he can't until he comes to that.
[10:08] It's like my brother was preaching
[10:09] Sunday school, pride.
[10:12] You got to let go and let God. So, I
[10:14] want to remember them this morning. and
[10:16] I just want to give you an update on
[10:18] what he's doing. Let's pray. Father, I
[10:21] love you. The token still holds, Lord,
[10:26] in the name of Jesus, we hold the token
[10:28] over our loved ones,
[10:30] over the things in life that, Father, we
[10:33] struggle with.
[10:35] But we thank you, Father, for the
[10:37] victory in Christ Jesus, in all things.
[10:39] Lord, I pray that you have blessed this
[10:43] congregation this morning, those that
[10:44] would be streaming, those that would
[10:46] archive it,
[10:49] may the words that have come forth as
[10:51] our brother prayed this morning, may
[10:53] they reach down into our hearts and
[10:57] Lord,
[10:59] bring that seed to more life.
[11:02] We thank you for your goodness and
[11:03] mercy. We thank you for the comfort and
[11:05] the peace and joy that you give us,
[11:07] Father.
[11:08] We just pray Lord this evening, this
[11:11] morning. I'm sorry
[11:13] that you would bless the tithes and
[11:14] offerings. Bless our worship. May you
[11:17] receive it as being in spirit and in
[11:20] truth. Love and worship you this
[11:23] morning, Father, in Jesus name. Amen.
[11:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's give the Lord a hand. Amen.
[11:34] Amen. Let's sing a little bit of He
[11:36] Abides. Amen.
[11:39] [Music]
[11:41] I'm rejoicing night and day as I walk
[11:45] this pilgrim way for the hands of God in
[11:49] all my life I see
[11:53] and the reason of my bliss. Yes, the
[11:57] secret all is this that the comforter
[12:02] abides with me. Let's put our hands
[12:04] together. will he abides.

[12:56] Well, once my heart was full of sin.
[12:59] Once I had no peace within till I heard
[13:04] how Jesus died upon the tree.
[13:09] Well then I fell down
[13:12] and there came up.
[13:15] Now the comforter abides with me.

[15:24] of life. Listen last verse now. Well,
[15:28] once my heart was
[15:31] and I had no peace with him
[15:36] [Music]
[15:38] on the tree.
[15:40] Oh, then I fell down
[15:44] and there came a peace so sweet
[15:49] abides with me.
[15:53] Oh, he abides.
[15:57] He abides.
[15:59] Sing hallelujah
[16:03] with me.
[16:06] Oh, I'm rejoicing night and day.
[16:10] As I walk this narrow way for the
[16:14] carpenter turn about with me.

[16:23] Amen. Amen. Amen. Brother Ken, if you
[16:26] come and give us a special this morning.
[16:29] Amen. Let's give Brother Ken a hand.
[16:34] Amen.
[16:36] Nope. Y'all can stay standing up.
[16:39] Come on, stand back up. Amen. I asked
[16:41] Ken to sing this song and I wanted it to
[16:44] kind of be a congregational. So, we're
[16:46] going to have a good time this morning.
[16:47] Amen. Let's give the Lord another hand.
[16:50] Hallelujah.
[16:55] Just a quick testimony. Uh couple
[16:57] Wednesdays ago, we asked Brother Jason
[16:59] to pray for our business. Um,
[17:02] not to go into all the details, but God
[17:04] gave us another location. And we were
[17:07] having a difficult time uh finding
[17:10] insurance for it. And um
[17:13] when we asked for prayer, it was like
[17:16] like a day or two later and God brought
[17:18] us not just a insurance policy, but a
[17:21] very good one at a great rate.
[17:24] &gt;&gt; So I just want to give the Lord glory
[17:26] and that's kind of what this song goes
[17:28] along with. So, you know, let's put our
[17:30] hands together and sing out with me on
[17:32] this song.
[17:35] Ain't no bird
[17:37] [Music]
[17:38] going to sing in my place.
[17:43] As long as I'm alive to glorify,
[17:47] I'll praise his name.
[17:51] I said there ain't no bird.
[17:56] We're going to sing in my place.

[23:12] [Music]
[23:18] You might not recognize me now.
[23:22] [Music]
[23:24] Those chains that once surrounded me are
[23:28] laying on the ground.
[23:30] [Music]
[23:32] You can't keep digging up my past.
[23:36] [Music]
[23:38] You may have had a laugh or two, but you
[23:43] won't get the last.
[23:47] You might not recognize me now.
[23:51] [Music]
[23:54] &gt;&gt; Maybe I was blind, but now I see. Maybe
[23:58] I was bound, but now I'm free. Maybe you
[24:02] need reminding you're under my feet.
[24:07] [Music]
[24:09] &gt;&gt; Maybe you're a lie that I don't need.
[24:13] Maybe you should listen when I speak.
[24:17] Maybe you need a minding. You're under
[24:20] my feet.
[24:26] If you want scars, I'll show you scars.
[24:33] All the wounds upon the hands of light
[24:37] that pierce the dark.
[24:41] If I were you, I'd be afraid.
[24:47] Cuz everything you meant for guilt. The
[24:51] cross is met with grace.
[24:55] [Music]
[24:58] Maybe I was blind, but now I see. Maybe
[25:02] I was bound, but now I'm free. Maybe you
[25:06] need reminding you're under my feet.
[25:13] &gt;&gt; Maybe you're a lie that I don't need.
[25:17] Maybe you should listen when I speak.
[25:20] Maybe you need a reminding you're under
[25:24] my feet.
[25:27] Oh.

[25:42] Oh.
[25:46] Oh.
[25:48] I think it's time that you remember. I
[25:52] think it's time that you remember.
[25:57] Maybe I was blind, but now I see. Maybe
[26:01] I was bound, but now I'm free. Maybe you
[26:05] need reminding. You're under my feet.
[26:12] &gt;&gt; Maybe you're a lie that I don't need.
[26:16] Maybe you should listen when I speak.
[26:20] Maybe you need a reminding you're under
[26:23] my feet.
[26:27] &gt;&gt; Maybe this is where we say farewell.

[26:38] feet.
[26:43] Under my feet.
[26:47] [Music]
[26:50] [Applause]
[26:57] Amen. Amen.
[27:01] I was tempted to sing a song, but I'm
[27:04] feeling the cause of the sister Dev to
[27:07] put her on the spot to give us a song.
[27:11] How you like that?
[27:13] Amen. Man, let's give Sister Deb a hand.
[27:15] Amen.
[27:16] [Applause]
[27:20] I did forewarn her. I said I may call
[27:22] you, but I was just wanting to kind of
[27:25] check her spirit. Amen. Amen. Let's give
[27:28] our sister another hand. Amen.
[27:33] [Music]
[27:37] I'm sure most of you know this song by
[27:39] now. It's really special to me
[27:42] because
[27:45] it it talks about how even if we don't
[27:48] really understand what's going on, that
[27:50] the Lord does have a plan. And sometimes
[27:54] it can be really hard to follow that
[27:55] plan, especially if you're really unsure
[27:58] about what you're supposed to do next
[27:59] and you just feel the the heat of the
[28:01] fire, but he his hand is still on you.
[28:05] And that has been a big lesson I've had
[28:07] to learn over the last few years. So, if
[28:09] you know the song, you can just sing
[28:10] along with me. And um I hope you
[28:13] appreciate the lyrics as much as I do.
[28:17] [Music]
[28:23] I know you're going
[28:26] through the
[28:30] [Music]
[28:33] hard
[28:35] heat.
[28:40] But even harder is the wondering
[28:48] is God's hand still on me.
[28:59] And it's lonely in the flames
[29:05] when you're counting days of pain.
[29:10] [Music]
[29:13] But the potter knows
[29:16] the clay
[29:20] how much pressure it can take.
[29:25] [Music]
[29:28] How many times around the wheel?
[29:36] Till there's submission to his will.
[29:44] He's planned a beautiful design,
[29:52] but it will take some fire
[29:56] and time.
[30:01] It's going to be okay
[30:04] [Music]
[30:08] cuz the potter knows
[30:11] the clay
[30:16] and I just came through that fire
[30:24] not too long ago. ago.
[30:31] And looking back, I can't see why.
[30:38] And that my God was in control.
[30:49] But on the hottest days, I'd cry,
[30:53] "Oh Lord,
[30:56] isn't it about time?"
[31:01] [Music]
[31:02] But the potter knows
[31:05] the clay
[31:10] how much pressure it can take.
[31:17] How many times around the week
[31:24] till their submission to his will?
[31:32] He's planned a beautiful design,
[31:40] but it will take some fire
[31:44] and time.
[31:49] It's going to be okay
[31:53] [Music]
[31:56] cuz the potter knows
[31:59] the clay
[32:03] how much pressure it can take.
[32:10] How many times around the wheel?
[32:15] [Music]
[32:18] Till there's submission to his will.
[32:25] He's planned a beautiful design,
[32:33] but it will take some fire and time.
[32:42] It's going to be okay
[32:48] [Music]
[32:49] cuz the potter knows
[32:52] the clay.
[32:54] [Music]
[33:02] [Applause]
[33:09] Amen. How many's ready for the word?
[33:12] Let's stand to our feet.
[33:23] When the music fades
[33:26] and all is stripped away
[33:30] and the simply comes
[33:37] longing just to bring
[33:42] something that's a word
[33:45] that will bless your heart.
[33:50] [Music]
[33:53] I'll bring you more than a song.
[33:58] For a song in itself is not what you
[34:03] have required.
[34:06] [Music]
[34:09] You search much deeper within
[34:14] through the way things appear. You're
[34:18] looking back to my heart.
[34:22] [Music]
[34:25] I'm coming back to a heart of worship.
[34:32] And it's all about you.
[34:37] All about you, Jesus.
[34:41] I'm sorry, Lord, for the things I've
[34:46] made.
[34:49] It's all about you.
[34:52] [Music]
[34:53] All about you, Jesus.
[34:58] [Music]
[35:05] King of endless world.
[35:10] No one could express
[35:13] how much you deserve.
[35:20] Though I'm weak and poor,
[35:25] all I have is yours.
[35:28] Every single
[35:30] breath
[35:36] you
[35:38] [Music]
[35:46] have.
[35:51] You search much deeper within
[35:56] through the way things appear. You're
[36:00] looking into my heart.
[36:07] I'm coming back to heart of worship
[36:14] when it's all about you.
[36:19] all about you, Jesus.
[36:23] I'm sorry, Lord, for things I made.
[36:31] All about you.
[36:33] [Music]
[36:35] All about you, Jesus.
[36:41] He's worthy of praise, friends. Give him
[36:43] a hand this morning to welcome the Lord.
[36:46] We come now to his word.
[36:50] Amen.
[36:52] Amen. God bless you. Turn around, shake
[36:54] hands with somebody. Say, "God bless
[36:55] you." Happy to have you all in the house
[36:57] of God today. Amen. Praise the Lord.
[37:02] Now, we got friends from all over today.
[37:05] Praise God.
[37:08] Happy to have you in the house of God
[37:09] today. Got friends from Virginia and
[37:12] Minnesota and Tennessee and Amen. Praise
[37:16] the Lord.
[37:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Praise the Lord to my best
[37:19] friends. Brother Jason walked in. God
[37:21] bless you, Brother Jason. Happy to have
[37:22] you here today, Belle. Good to see you
[37:24] again, honey, sister. Amen. Praise the
[37:27] Lord. Amen. Happy to have all of you.
[37:30] Amen. Y'all shake hands yet?
[37:34] Amen. Praise the Lord. God bless you.
[37:36] We're going to invite you to Galatians
[37:38] chapter 3.
[37:40] Amen. Praise the Lord.
[37:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:43] &gt;&gt; Um Galatians chapter 3. We want to
[37:45] continue our thought that today should
[37:47] be part six, I believe. Uh we had a
[37:49] little mixup on the u
[37:52] on the YouTube site. I think it was
[37:55] showing four twice. Last time would have
[37:56] been five, so this would be six. So, we
[37:59] sent that correction in. And we're
[38:01] making some changes to the website. So,
[38:04] just for people streaming, I've had uh
[38:06] some emails and questions. We're working
[38:09] on some changes and making some changes,
[38:10] but you can always get the archive and
[38:14] the live stream on our YouTube channel.
[38:16] Amen. We're trying to get our website
[38:18] back function again and may already have
[38:20] it already. Um, brother Matt working on
[38:22] that diligently.
[38:24] Amen. Praise the Lord. Had a wonderful
[38:27] time yesterday. Amen. Uh, at the wedding
[38:30] there with brother Joshua. And I was
[38:33] told, make sure you call him Joshua.
[38:36] Amen. and I had to call her Isabelle.
[38:38] And so instead of Josh and Belle. So I
[38:41] told them to make sure they were in by
[38:42] 9:00 last night, but I don't think they
[38:45] listened to that.
[38:47] &gt;&gt; Did they? Okay. Praise the Lord. Well,
[38:49] you're supposed to uh listen to your
[38:52] pastor. Amen. Praise the Lord.
[38:55] Amen. Brother Doug, it's so good to see
[38:57] you guys. Uh they walked into the
[38:58] wedding yesterday and I thought they've
[39:00] stepped I thought I was seeing a vision.
[39:02] Amen. And there they were. Come to the
[39:04] wedding. who are happy in the Lord for
[39:06] all of that. And one and all, God bless
[39:08] you today. Let's look at Galatians
[39:10] chapter 3. We're going to begin at verse
[39:13] one and we'll read down and we'll skip a
[39:16] little bit along here just to save time.
[39:20] We're continuing on future events
[39:22] becoming clear in prophecy.
[39:25] And don't forget, don't forget the theme
[39:27] of the whole thing. Whether we were in
[39:29] our previous nine-part series of past
[39:32] events, modern events, but now future
[39:35] events, don't forget that the bride of
[39:38] the last day is the most significant
[39:40] modern event made clear in prophecy. So,
[39:44] it's all about you uh becoming
[39:46] everything that God has envisioned for
[39:48] his family. We're going to look today
[39:50] and he's been planning it a long time.
[39:52] To God, it's not a long time, but to us,
[39:54] it's covered it's covered multiple
[39:56] millennia. Oh foolish Galatians verse
[39:59] one Paul says who hath bewitched you
[40:02] that ye should not obey the truth before
[40:06] whose eyes Jesus Christ hath been
[40:09] evidently set forth crucified among you.
[40:14] This only would I learn of you received
[40:16] you the spirit by the works of the law
[40:18] or by the hearing of faith? Are you so
[40:22] foolish having begun in the spirit? Are
[40:24] you now made perfect by the flesh? Have
[40:28] you suffered so many things in vain, if
[40:30] it be yet in vain? He therefore that
[40:34] ministerth to you the spirit, and
[40:37] workketh miracles among you, doth he it
[40:41] by the works of the law, or by the
[40:44] hearing of faith, even as Abraham
[40:47] believed God, and it was accounted to
[40:49] him for righteousness.
[40:51] Know ye therefore that they which are of
[40:54] faith, the same are the children of
[40:57] Abraham. And the scripture foreseeing
[41:01] that God would justify the heathen
[41:03] through faith preached before the gospel
[41:06] unto Abraham, saying, In thee shall all
[41:10] nations be blessed. So then they which
[41:14] be of faith are blessed with fa faithful
[41:18] Abraham. Verse 13, Christ hath redeemed
[41:22] us from the curse of the law, being made
[41:26] a curse for us. For it is written,
[41:29] Cursed is everyone that hangeth on a
[41:31] tree, that the blessing of Abraham might
[41:35] come on the Gentiles through Jesus
[41:37] Christ, that we might receive the
[41:40] promise of the Spirit through faith.
[41:42] Verse 16. Now to Abraham and his seed
[41:47] were the promises made. He saith not and
[41:50] to seeds as of many, but as of one and
[41:55] to thy seed which is Christ. Hebrews
[42:00] chapter 2, one quick verse. If they'll
[42:02] just put that up for me. Um, by the time
[42:05] you find it, I'll probably have already
[42:06] read it. Hebrews chapter 2, verse 10.
[42:10] For it became him,
[42:12] for whom are all things,
[42:15] and by whom are all things, in bringing
[42:19] many sons unto glory, to make the
[42:23] captain of their salvation perfect
[42:26] through sufferings. So, he's bringing
[42:29] many sons to glory. It wasn't just after
[42:32] Abraham, right? And so God was never
[42:36] going to be satisfied to just stay
[42:37] bottled up in one Nazarene walking the
[42:40] shores of Galilee going about doing
[42:43] good. Right? The whole plan, remember
[42:46] that he said before the gospels ever
[42:49] came, God was already before the gospels
[42:52] was preaching this what you read in the
[42:55] Gospels, he was preaching it to Abraham.
[42:57] So Paul was saying what I'm saying
[43:00] agrees with the gospels which agree with
[43:02] Genesis. So this is a a great example of
[43:06] this dovetailing of the scripture from
[43:09] Genesis to the four gospels to Paul's
[43:12] letter to the Galatians. There's no
[43:15] break. It's all saying the same thing.
[43:17] And now Paul is trying to get them to
[43:19] understand he's bringing many sons to
[43:21] glory. So let's then look. How many
[43:24] would like to be part of that? Sons and
[43:25] daughters. Amen. Amen. And so, uh, so we
[43:30] I've said many times, you know, when we
[43:32] talk about sons, you sisters have to say
[43:34] amen, too. Uh, because I have to say
[43:36] amen when he says bride.
[43:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, it's all when he talks about
[43:42] man, very often times it's a Hebrew word
[43:44] or a Greek equivalent meaning mankind or
[43:46] humanity. Amen. So, he's bringing many
[43:49] sons, many members of the kingdom.
[43:52] That's always been the plan. Everything
[43:54] you see is all about that. All right.
[43:57] So, let's pray. Master, we commit
[44:00] ourselves into your hands right now and
[44:03] we ask for your divine mercy, Lord, upon
[44:06] our lives and upon the preaching of the
[44:08] word. Lord, we're going to take another
[44:10] installment today. We already can see,
[44:13] Lord, that it's more than we can cover
[44:15] today. There's more yet to say after
[44:17] today, but may it be so that today we
[44:21] will say exactly what you want said
[44:23] today. May it be so, Father. We commit
[44:26] it to you and ourselves into your hands
[44:28] for service and leadership. Just your
[44:31] assistant. That's all I am. I'm just
[44:33] here to assist you, Lord. In Jesus name
[44:35] we pray. Amen. God bless you, friends.
[44:38] You can be seated.
[44:47] that just so leapt out at me this
[44:50] morning. How that Paul from his vantage
[44:53] point, you know, sometime after the
[44:57] crucifixion, the death, the burial and
[44:59] resurrection, ascension, the descending
[45:01] of the spirit back into the church. And
[45:04] now the church is running toward um the
[45:07] resurrection.
[45:09] And Paul has birthed a church there in
[45:11] Galatia. And Judaizers have come in
[45:14] behind him and uh sewing discord and
[45:17] sewing seeds of discrepancy trying to
[45:20] get the people back to observing various
[45:22] elements of the of the of the u the law
[45:26] of Sinai. But but if they could have
[45:29] only realized friends that what Paul was
[45:32] trying to get across to them is that the
[45:35] law from Sinai uh you know first of all
[45:39] was not they called that the law of
[45:41] Moses but that really wasn't the law
[45:44] that wasn't Moses doing and I get the I
[45:47] don't want to argue over semantics I'm
[45:49] just wanting to make a point. I get that
[45:51] that law came and and Moses brought it
[45:54] to them on tables but Moses didn't write
[45:56] it. The finger of God wrote it.
[45:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. And it was never Moses idea. In
[46:02] fact is it was not it was really not
[46:05] God's intention, but it was the people.
[46:08] And prophet talked about it was the the
[46:10] most rational decision they ever made.
[46:12] They ha that they had a pillar of fire.
[46:15] They had a prophet. They had a a cloud
[46:18] by day, fire by night. They had the
[46:19] brazen altar. They had everything
[46:21] working uh under grace, under the
[46:24] promise. God was fulfilling to his
[46:26] children what he had promised Abraham.
[46:28] And here they come along wanting a part
[46:31] in it. They wanted to feel like we're
[46:33] accomplishing something and they wanted
[46:35] works. They chose works. They chose law
[46:38] over grace.
[46:40] &gt;&gt; So So when we when we call it the law of
[46:42] Moses to me the the the law that that
[46:46] law of Sinai was the people's choice.
[46:49] The law of Moses had always been, "The
[46:52] Lord your God shall raise up a prophet
[46:55] like me
[46:56] &gt;&gt; from among your brethren, and whoever
[46:58] won't hear him will be cut off." That
[47:00] was the law of Moses because otherwise
[47:03] you can't make it fit when you get
[47:04] across Jordan and you've got God telling
[47:08] Joshua, now Jordan represents, you know,
[47:11] crossing over into the Holy Ghost
[47:13] &gt;&gt; and now crossing over into the Canaan's
[47:15] land, the Holy Ghost, not the
[47:16] millennium, the Holy Ghost. And now God
[47:19] says remember the law of Moses. And
[47:21] you're thinking, well, wait a minute.
[47:22] Now it's almost like God is
[47:24] contradicting himself in the type. Now
[47:26] the type is broken. You mean in the Holy
[47:28] Ghost, we're coming back to a man-made
[47:30] law from Sinai? No. The law of Moses was
[47:33] about a Messiah coming.
[47:35] &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost that it wouldn't just be
[47:37] God above or God with, but God in. And
[47:41] that would reproduce in a kingdom of
[47:44] saints.
[47:45] &gt;&gt; It's a beautiful plan. the plan of
[47:47] redemption. And so, so we realize then
[47:51] that that overall as we've been studying
[47:54] it, the prevailing view across both
[47:58] Jewish and Christian traditions
[48:01] concerning the name change of Abraham,
[48:04] we dealt with that a lot last Sunday. I
[48:05] want to talk about some more about it
[48:07] today. We want to carry on from there.
[48:09] But it it doesn't matter whether it was
[48:11] Jewish tradition. We went back and
[48:13] quoted to you historians and and and
[48:16] great thinkers under the man age and
[48:18] Matthew Henry and and and and and t trap
[48:22] I believe and and some other different
[48:24] ones and there were other ones also.
[48:25] Augustine spoke about it and so Origin
[48:28] spoke about it. But but we find that
[48:31] that they were they all agree that the
[48:35] name change when God changed Abram's
[48:39] name to Abraham that it was a pivotal
[48:42] moment that that it was a pivotal moment
[48:46] in the redemptive plan that we're
[48:48] talking about today. Brother Brandham
[48:51] talks about how that, you know, there
[48:53] we're there's times when we're, you
[48:56] know, on our journey back home, uh, that
[48:59] we're turning a corner and, you know, it
[49:02] just like it signals it signals
[49:04] elevation like when we read um,
[49:06] Revelation 4. See, we we know that
[49:09] Revelation 4 is caught up into the
[49:13] revealed word. And and I get that at the
[49:16] end of chapter 3, and we've taught on
[49:17] that. I'm not going to get sidetracked
[49:19] in that today. the bride goes up. That's
[49:20] all true. Brother Brandham then begins
[49:22] to explain that chapters 5 and four is
[49:25] God from 4 through 10 showing how he
[49:29] raptured that church at the end of seven
[49:32] ages. Oh, you're headed for a rapture.
[49:34] You are at the end of the seventh age.
[49:37] &gt;&gt; There wasn't an eighth one. There wasn't
[49:39] an eighth messenger. He only had seven
[49:41] stars in his right hand. And so what
[49:44] what we look for then if it's not our
[49:47] body change then what is it then it then
[49:50] it becomes a spiritual elevation and we
[49:54] remember that our entire journey of life
[49:57] and here's where we were really uh
[50:00] trying to get you to understand in these
[50:03] previous sessions because this is where
[50:05] your real strength to beat the devil
[50:07] down will come from an understanding of
[50:10] who you are in Christ and what Christ
[50:12] has done on your behalf and that when
[50:14] the bride recognizes who she is in that
[50:17] position and that and that she came from
[50:20] God and goes back to God, we remember
[50:23] that our entire earthly journey, don't
[50:27] lose sight of this. If you leave here
[50:29] today and this is all you remember, it's
[50:31] a journey uh going back home.
[50:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[50:36] &gt;&gt; It's a journey of restoration. Because
[50:39] I'm here to tell you, home for me is not
[50:41] this drop-own place called time.
[50:44] &gt;&gt; No sirm. It's not where I started. I
[50:46] didn't start here and I'm not finishing
[50:48] here.
[50:49] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says in the message
[50:51] perfection, that's a great title. 1956.
[50:54] Now, this great chain of perfection and
[50:56] he he's he's going to actually draw a
[50:59] circle. I started to put it up here
[51:00] today and he and it's a circle
[51:03] representing we were dealing with that
[51:04] yesterday at the giving and receiving of
[51:06] rings. It's an eternal circle. And he
[51:09] says, "Now this great chain of
[51:10] perfection was broken by time space."
[51:15] So, so remember that that you know I
[51:18] preached here some maybe a year ago.
[51:21] Life interrupted and life interrupted is
[51:24] not the hardships that I've had in this
[51:26] life are the losses. I'll have more
[51:29] hardships.
[51:30] &gt;&gt; I'll have more losses. I'm never going
[51:32] to get beyond those. I'm going to
[51:33] finally get beyond them. But man that's
[51:36] born of a woman is a few days and full
[51:38] of trouble. And so it's just you're
[51:41] either you either just come out of a
[51:43] hardship or a trial or you're in a
[51:45] hardship or a trial or you're headed for
[51:47] a hardship or a trial.
[51:48] &gt;&gt; But my journey is not to stay here. My
[51:51] journey is to escape here. Hallelujah.
[51:54] &gt;&gt; And so, so we we realize that that the
[51:57] fact that I was in Christ and that I
[52:01] came here, that is my life interrupted.
[52:05] &gt;&gt; My life interrupted is that I used to be
[52:08] a part of God. Thank God I'm going back
[52:10] to that when this awful interruption is
[52:13] over.
[52:16] So he says this great chain of
[52:18] perfection was broken by time space.
[52:22] Time came because of sin. Let's draw a
[52:26] picture of time. Let's see a perfect
[52:28] circle forever. Forever. And then all of
[52:31] a once sin dropped in and put a little
[52:34] and he says as my wife calls it a little
[52:37] hickey or a little drop down in the
[52:40] chain. So now instead of a perfect
[52:42] circle, you've got this little drop
[52:45] down, this little loop 6,000 years
[52:48] &gt;&gt; of human history in a fallen condition.
[52:51] Eventually it comes back into the circle
[52:54] again.
[52:55] &gt;&gt; Now the circle of eternity didn't stop.
[52:58] &gt;&gt; Only we got interrupted.
[53:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:02] &gt;&gt; So he says eternity
[53:07] continues on. See, so so brother
[53:10] Brandham talks about how that, you know,
[53:13] sin, you know, broke the whole picture
[53:16] and and but brother Brandham says, "But
[53:18] you come anyway. You still arrived here,
[53:20] but you were born lost." See, so then
[53:23] Jesus has to come and pay that price to
[53:25] redeem you back. So he says, "Eternity
[53:28] continues on, but it's not in its
[53:30] perfect condition. Here's a little gap
[53:33] come down, breaks over this way, goes
[53:35] out this way. God had to do that because
[53:39] Satan caused it and it dropped down to a
[53:42] space of time. Here's why, friends. For
[53:46] here, here's here's the here's the
[53:49] essence of every trial loss that you've
[53:51] ever faced. God did it this way. God had
[53:55] to do that because Satan caused it and
[53:57] it dropped down to a space of time for
[54:00] the trying and the perfecting and the
[54:04] purging of the lost. That God by his
[54:08] sovereign grace might someday lift that
[54:11] little hickey or gap back into the
[54:14] perfect circle. Then she rolls on just
[54:17] the same. Amen.
[54:20] &gt;&gt; So, we found a bride identified in the
[54:23] word with a higher calling because
[54:27] that's what the word does for us. The
[54:29] revelation of the word of God is not
[54:32] just theology or or doctrinal, you know,
[54:35] memorization skills. It's not really
[54:37] about that. There's, you know, there
[54:39] there there's there's one man that I
[54:41] heard about as growing up and they
[54:42] called him the walking Bible. The man
[54:44] had literally committed to memory 6,000
[54:48] Bible verses.
[54:50] And I mean, I'm thinking, wow, do I can
[54:52] I even quote six verbatim and not miss a
[54:55] word? And this guy's got 6,000 of them.
[54:58] They called him the walking Bible. God
[55:00] bless him for that effort. But but
[55:02] that's not my requirement. That's not
[55:04] your requirement. The bride is
[55:06] identified by the word that she has a
[55:09] calling that is not something she did
[55:12] herself. It is a calling from God. It is
[55:15] a blessing from God. But now here's
[55:18] where it circles back to come to you and
[55:21] I. It calls you to a higher
[55:23] responsibility.
[55:27] &gt;&gt; The world loves walking around in a
[55:29] candy shop thinking that Jesus paid it
[55:33] all and I don't have to do anything.
[55:35] That's not the gospel. That's never been
[55:37] the gospel and that will never be the
[55:39] gospel. The whole point of the gospel,
[55:42] the whole point of the Holy Ghost is to
[55:43] change you into him,
[55:46] &gt;&gt; not leave you as you.
[55:48] &gt;&gt; If he was going to leave you as you, he
[55:50] would have never had to die anyway. See?
[55:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:53] &gt;&gt; So, so then we've observed uh in our
[55:57] past sessions that God uses the the
[56:00] Hebrew out of the Hebrew alphabet. And I
[56:04] and it's it looks like an N, but it's
[56:06] it's actually three letters. It takes
[56:07] three English letters to to pronounce
[56:09] it. It's he h e h he it's like the
[56:13] breath of god. So it's actually the very
[56:16] letter it's the breath of god that
[56:18] created the world. And it's and here was
[56:21] the point we were making last time that
[56:23] it is that exact same letter that he
[56:28] that same creative breath that produced
[56:32] a creative word. That's the exact same
[56:36] uh power word and even the very same
[56:41] letter that God employed when he was
[56:44] changing Abram to Abraham. So you can
[56:48] rest assure that it was with that kind
[56:51] of involvement that God is going to use
[56:54] Genesis power to do something that it
[56:56] wasn't just listen Abram go down to the
[57:00] court county clerk and fill out a
[57:02] document and sign it and get your name
[57:05] changed.
[57:06] &gt;&gt; This wasn't just some casual name
[57:08] change. God literally summoned the
[57:11] creative power of his word. He was doing
[57:14] more than just changing letters of his
[57:17] name. He was he was showing you and I
[57:20] that he doesn't just make us Baptist or
[57:22] Methodists or Presbyterians. He makes us
[57:24] Mrs. Jesus Christ. This is a
[57:27] supernatural change that occurs by the
[57:31] supernatural word
[57:33] &gt;&gt; that you put your faith in.
[57:37] See,
[57:38] so it's literally the breath or the word
[57:41] of God speaking creation into existence.
[57:45] So you should be able to see today that
[57:49] your new birth is an act of the exact
[57:52] same creative word.
[57:54] &gt;&gt; That's what the new birth is. It's not
[57:57] something you can do yourself. It's not
[57:59] something you can confess. It's not a
[58:01] prayer you can read. It's not words you
[58:04] can say. It's not any of that thing.
[58:06] It's not any kind of life you can live.
[58:09] It's God by his creative power finding
[58:12] his children and sending them his
[58:14] creative word. And his children who are
[58:17] part of that word recognize that word.
[58:19] It is innate. It is intrinsic. They they
[58:21] can't not believe it.
[58:24] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[58:25] &gt;&gt; And the evidence of that that it's
[58:27] supernatural is that it changes their
[58:29] life completely.
[58:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. They're in no way the same person.
[58:35] That's right.
[58:38] &gt;&gt; So, this is exactly what James was
[58:40] talking about in James 1:18. Don't
[58:42] bother trying to follow me. Let me just
[58:44] quote it. Of his own will begget he us
[58:47] with the word of truth.
[58:49] &gt;&gt; So, don't ever let anyone say to you,
[58:51] "You got born again because you made a
[58:54] decision to read a sinner's prayer."
[58:56] &gt;&gt; You might have read a sinner's prayer.
[58:58] You might read a thousand of them. You
[58:59] might have knelt at an altar and you
[59:01] might have got born again there, but all
[59:03] you did was find out you had always been
[59:05] a child of God.
[59:07] &gt;&gt; When the supernatural takes place,
[59:09] that's what really reveals it to you.
[59:11] And in that revelation becomes a
[59:13] strength. And friends, that's why you
[59:15] notice that that Abraham, you know, once
[59:18] he moved into the office of of he became
[59:22] a father and now a son comes on the
[59:24] scene. My goodness, before that, he gets
[59:27] caught lying down. He first of all he
[59:30] backslides and leaves the promised land.
[59:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:33] &gt;&gt; Because why? Trials and hardship.
[59:35] &gt;&gt; They had a famine. So he took off and he
[59:38] hadn't, you know, had a hard time fully
[59:40] obeying God. Took his father with him
[59:42] and and that held up 10 years and then
[59:44] he finally got somewhere and then the
[59:46] famine came. Then he's you find him
[59:47] backslid. He any Jew that leaves
[59:49] Palestine there, brother Am says that
[59:51] leaves the promised land is backslid.
[59:52] And so he goes down there. We see him
[59:54] lying, you know, to to save his skin
[59:57] full of fear. Yeah,
[59:59] &gt;&gt; Sarah, they'll kill me. You're going to
[1:00:00] have to lie. See, that's why we we have
[1:00:03] said to you so many times, it's Paul's
[1:00:05] not saying Abraham never made a mistake.
[1:00:07] Paul's saying Abraham never stumbled at
[1:00:09] the promise.
[1:00:11] &gt;&gt; Even though it looks a lot of times by
[1:00:13] the observer, wow, you're down there
[1:00:15] afraid. You're out of the promised land.
[1:00:18] You're lying to Pharaoh. You almost get
[1:00:20] killed. You almost lose Sarah. You pick
[1:00:22] up Hagar. Your people are paying for
[1:00:25] that to this day. And then and then what
[1:00:27] do you see him next? Then he's then he's
[1:00:29] over here in front of the king of the
[1:00:31] Philistines. Uh listen Sarah, that same
[1:00:33] old thing. See friends, all that happens
[1:00:35] is when you come to Christ and you don't
[1:00:38] come to a full new birth, you just keep
[1:00:40] a little ticking time bomb down inside
[1:00:42] there. And all it needs is the right
[1:00:44] environment and the right time and the
[1:00:46] right setting to come around and that
[1:00:47] thing will blow up again and again and
[1:00:50] again. You've got to die and get that
[1:00:52] picking time bomb out of you. Yes.
[1:00:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:58] &gt;&gt; And so once he has Isaac and now you can
[1:01:02] see that now you have the son on the
[1:01:05] scene. And once sunship comes on the
[1:01:07] scene, you don't find Abraham doing that
[1:01:09] anymore. See, then he's faithful to the
[1:01:12] Lord from then on, even willing to kill
[1:01:14] his son uh to prove his faith. That's
[1:01:17] pretty intense.
[1:01:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. Here he was trying to save his own
[1:01:20] skin and now he's willing to take his
[1:01:23] son, his only son, as far as God was
[1:01:25] concerned. First Peter, so so James 18
[1:01:27] said, "Of his own, of his own will
[1:01:30] begott he us with the word of truth."
[1:01:33] Amen. That here's why. That we should be
[1:01:36] a kind of first fruits of his creatures.
[1:01:39] &gt;&gt; So he saved you to make him like him.
[1:01:43] &gt;&gt; To make you like him.
[1:01:45] &gt;&gt; Peter says the same thing. 1 Peter 1:23
[1:01:48] 123 Being born again, not of corruptible
[1:01:52] seed,
[1:01:53] &gt;&gt; but of incorruptible
[1:01:55] by the word of God, which liveth and
[1:01:58] abideth forever. So your new birth comes
[1:02:02] because you have a faith in the revealed
[1:02:05] word of God. It's always been that. It's
[1:02:08] never not been that. There's no form of
[1:02:11] the gospel of Jesus Christ that has ever
[1:02:14] been different than that. Even back in
[1:02:16] the Old Testament, it was always that it
[1:02:19] was God has spoken. You're either going
[1:02:21] to believe it and follow it or you
[1:02:23] won't.
[1:02:25] &gt;&gt; And and and it and if you don't, none of
[1:02:28] your good deeds will matter. And if you
[1:02:30] do, none of your bad deeds will matter.
[1:02:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:02:37] &gt;&gt; So, his creative word is what sets the
[1:02:41] divine purpose for our lives. Would you
[1:02:43] agree with that?
[1:02:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:45] So we find then that the same creative
[1:02:48] word that changes our nature in the
[1:02:52] realm of our soul that same that same
[1:02:56] creative word that brother Brandham says
[1:02:58] now that puts the believer back across
[1:03:01] the chasm.
[1:03:02] &gt;&gt; See and remember we're sitting in
[1:03:04] heavenly places in Christ Jesus. That's
[1:03:07] right now my soul is already in heavenly
[1:03:10] places in Christ Jesus. You say, "But
[1:03:13] but your soul's in your body." Exactly.
[1:03:15] And that's where Jesus rules and reigns
[1:03:18] inside my heart. You see, stop looking
[1:03:20] at God and trying to divide him up in
[1:03:22] per in persons, places, and things. God
[1:03:25] fills all time and space and eternity.
[1:03:27] See? So, it doesn't matter that he rules
[1:03:29] from heaven. He lives in me. He lives in
[1:03:31] you.
[1:03:32] &gt;&gt; See?
[1:03:34] &gt;&gt; All right. So, a lot more to say on
[1:03:36] that. I don't won't have time to get to
[1:03:37] it today. I've already set it aside for
[1:03:39] a different portion.
[1:03:42] So, it's that same creative word that
[1:03:45] puts us back across the chasm, that
[1:03:48] chasm that exists between the land we
[1:03:51] came from and the land we live in now.
[1:03:54] &gt;&gt; And Jesus bridged that chasm. You came
[1:03:58] from God, but you came here fallen. A
[1:04:00] chasm between you. No way to get back.
[1:04:03] Jesus Christ bridged that chasm for his
[1:04:06] family. So, through Christ, I am joined
[1:04:08] back to God. I'm enjoined through the
[1:04:12] blood of Jesus back to Abraham. Now I'm
[1:04:14] a son of Abraham.
[1:04:16] &gt;&gt; See, so the same power that raised Jesus
[1:04:21] from the dead is the same power that
[1:04:23] quickens our inner life. Uh quickens it
[1:04:27] quickens our inner life that was deep
[1:04:29] within us as a gene of God all along.
[1:04:32] And it is when that quickening comes to
[1:04:35] pass by that same power that raised
[1:04:39] Jesus from the dead, it molds us into
[1:04:42] the image of the children of Abraham.
[1:04:44] And it makes us hes according to the
[1:04:47] same promise given to him. I mean, ask
[1:04:49] yourself a question. When that
[1:04:51] quickening power came back to Jesus in a
[1:04:54] grave, did he still look like a dead
[1:04:57] man?
[1:04:59] &gt;&gt; Not at all. In fact is when they came to
[1:05:02] find him, all they found was a napkin
[1:05:04] and his garment. They didn't even find
[1:05:06] him. He was not in a tomb. He was not
[1:05:09] dead. He was completely changed. And
[1:05:12] that same power that raised Jesus, if it
[1:05:15] quickens your mortal body, it shall also
[1:05:18] make you a new creation. And you won't
[1:05:20] be the same as you were before. Amen.
[1:05:27] &gt;&gt; So in he in this Hebrew word
[1:05:32] uh he is symbolic symbolically and this
[1:05:36] is from my lexical aid it is associated
[1:05:39] with another Hebrew word if I'm
[1:05:41] pronouncing it correct bina b i i n ah
[1:05:44] and it means understanding. So I want
[1:05:48] you to know something friends the same
[1:05:50] god that saved you understands you.
[1:05:52] Amen.
[1:05:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:54] &gt;&gt; He knows
[1:05:56] &gt;&gt; what you're going through.
[1:05:58] &gt;&gt; Don't think that he is some far removed
[1:06:00] god unconcerned. Nothing could possibly
[1:06:04] be further from the truth than that.
[1:06:07] &gt;&gt; He has tremendous understanding. In fact
[1:06:10] is this this word this symbolically
[1:06:13] associated word uh ba it means a divine
[1:06:17] attribute and it's actually used in the
[1:06:20] Old Testament 38 times. I'm not going to
[1:06:22] cover them all today, but Proverbs
[1:06:24] Solomon speaks about it and how that it
[1:06:27] it was personified as the companion of
[1:06:30] wisdom and he urged people in Proverbs 2
[1:06:33] and 3, he urged people to seek for it.
[1:06:36] So, seek wisdom, seek understanding.
[1:06:39] You're not, you know, it's not just, you
[1:06:42] know, uh, like you've heard me say so
[1:06:44] many times, God didn't say, "Okay,
[1:06:47] you're saved. see in heaven.
[1:06:49] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:06:50] &gt;&gt; Or yeah, the ship of Zion is coming.
[1:06:52] Take your luggage and go down to the
[1:06:54] docks and sit on your luggage.
[1:06:55] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:06:56] &gt;&gt; Wait for the old ship of Zion. No, he
[1:06:58] wants you to have understanding. When
[1:07:00] the bride has understanding,
[1:07:03] &gt;&gt; why are we preaching this series? So we
[1:07:05] have biblical understanding of how I got
[1:07:07] here, why I'm here, why I got chosen,
[1:07:11] why I'm born again, what am I to do,
[1:07:13] where am I going, how am I getting
[1:07:15] there? Amen.
[1:07:17] &gt;&gt; What do all of these modern events that
[1:07:19] I see happening that has men's hearts
[1:07:22] failing for fear in the world in gross
[1:07:25] darkness? How is it that I see it all so
[1:07:27] clearly and I know what it's I know
[1:07:30] what's up. I know the why.
[1:07:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:34] &gt;&gt; Say, how are we going to get out of
[1:07:35] here? I know the how.
[1:07:42] &gt;&gt; Amen, brother. Uh Lee used to say, "I
[1:07:46] know the the very hour that the Lord is
[1:07:50] coming."
[1:07:51] And when people finally, you know, put
[1:07:54] their false teeth back in their mouth
[1:07:55] and caught their breath. And brother
[1:07:58] Lee, what's the hour of his coming? In
[1:08:00] the hour you think not.
[1:08:06] So it it's also the same word. It's a
[1:08:09] companion to wisdom. It's the exact same
[1:08:12] spirit that that fell upon them when
[1:08:14] they were erecting the tabernacle in the
[1:08:16] wilderness. You find that in Exodus 31,
[1:08:18] Exodus 35. Isaiah describes it uh as the
[1:08:22] coming Messiah is endowed with the
[1:08:25] spirit of wisdom. Isaiah 11, various
[1:08:27] places. So it it it it comes back to
[1:08:31] just more than a knowing the what. I
[1:08:34] know the how and I know the why. And
[1:08:38] that should inform our thinking on our
[1:08:40] daily life. Am I just living here and
[1:08:45] getting an education and getting a
[1:08:47] career and getting married and having a
[1:08:49] family, paying bills, paying taxes, take
[1:08:51] vacations, uh start all around again, go
[1:08:54] work, come back, get some sleep, eat, go
[1:08:56] back, do the next same thing. Is that
[1:08:58] all there is to life? I I'm here to tell
[1:09:00] you friends, that's not even real life.
[1:09:03] That's just this little hickey. That's
[1:09:05] just this little uh wayside station. I'm
[1:09:08] going back to an eternity. Hallelujah,
[1:09:11] friends. And I I won't have to face
[1:09:13] these kinds of things. I'm so glad to
[1:09:15] know I'll never have to come back here
[1:09:17] and do this again.
[1:09:20] &gt;&gt; It gives me ba. It gives me
[1:09:22] understanding. I I have found the
[1:09:25] companion to wisdom. And therefore I now
[1:09:29] I'm know what to do with all this wisdom
[1:09:33] because now I have understanding
[1:09:36] how to how to employ it.
[1:09:39] So you you see this actually in Abraham
[1:09:42] as well. Genesis 18 uh 16 uh 17 and 18.
[1:09:48] And the men arose up from then and
[1:09:50] looked towards Sodom. Now this is the
[1:09:53] days of Lot.
[1:09:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:54] &gt;&gt; So now think Luke 17:30. This is in
[1:09:57] Genesis, right? Luke 17:30 is foretold
[1:10:01] in the gospels that at the end time, the
[1:10:05] gospels foretell that at the end time it
[1:10:07] would return back to the days of Lot.
[1:10:09] And the same principles that applied
[1:10:11] there would apply here. That's what the
[1:10:13] gospel message is telling us. And the
[1:10:16] men rose up from then and looked towards
[1:10:18] Sodom and Abraham went with them to
[1:10:22] bring them on the way. And the Lord
[1:10:25] said, "Shall I hide from Abraham that
[1:10:30] thing which I do?" Now, we're coming
[1:10:31] back to ba. We're coming back to wisdom.
[1:10:33] We're coming back to understanding.
[1:10:36] Shall I hide from Abraham that thing
[1:10:39] which I do? Seeing that Abraham shall
[1:10:43] surely become a great and mighty nation,
[1:10:46] and all the nations of the earth shall
[1:10:48] be blessed in him. Abraham and his wife
[1:10:51] were still barren.
[1:10:54] I mean, you know, as as far as bringing
[1:10:56] the promised son on the scene, there's
[1:10:58] no Isaac. And so, he's come now to say
[1:11:01] about this time next year, you'll have a
[1:11:04] son. He had he had a son through Hagar.
[1:11:08] But here is here is Sarah in her old
[1:11:10] age. Her name has been added an H also,
[1:11:14] just like Abram to Abraham. Sarai went
[1:11:16] to Sarah because God is also the same
[1:11:20] the same word that that brought forth
[1:11:23] Christ is the same word that brings
[1:11:25] forth the bride.
[1:11:27] &gt;&gt; The same power that raised him is the
[1:11:28] same power that changes you.
[1:11:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:31] &gt;&gt; You both have the same origin.
[1:11:34] &gt;&gt; You both have the same makeup. You're
[1:11:36] both made of the same element, the word.
[1:11:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:41] &gt;&gt; See, so this is why you have the faith
[1:11:43] of the son of God. Not you're not
[1:11:45] limited to a faith in the son of God.
[1:11:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:49] &gt;&gt; The unwise virgin have a faith in the
[1:11:52] son of God and are saints and sanctified
[1:11:55] people and righteous people and will be
[1:11:57] granted eternal life because of their
[1:11:59] heart response to the word. But we're
[1:12:02] not talking about just a faith in the
[1:12:03] son of God. We're talking about the
[1:12:05] faith of the son of God.
[1:12:08] So, so we find that he he says, "He
[1:12:13] shall become a great and mighty nation,
[1:12:16] and all the nations of the earth shall
[1:12:18] be blessed in him." Now, James picks up
[1:12:21] on that in James 2:23, "And the
[1:12:23] scripture was fulfilled, which saith,"
[1:12:25] Abraham believed God, and it was imputed
[1:12:28] unto him for righteousness, and he was
[1:12:30] called the friend of God. See,
[1:12:33] &gt;&gt; Jesus talks about that. St. John called
[1:12:35] that and wrote it in his in his gospel.
[1:12:37] St. John 15:15, "Henceforth," Jesus
[1:12:40] speaking, "henceforth I call you not
[1:12:42] servants, for the servant knoweth not
[1:12:45] what his lord doeth, but I have called
[1:12:48] you friends. For all things that I have
[1:12:51] heard of my father, I have made known
[1:12:54] unto you." See, so now when you come
[1:12:56] back to Genesis, we left off in God
[1:12:59] saying, "Seeing that Abraham shall
[1:13:02] surely become shall verse 17, shall I
[1:13:04] hide anything from Abraham, seeing he
[1:13:06] shall become a great and mighty nation?
[1:13:08] The all the earth shall be blessed in
[1:13:10] him." Then verse 19, for I know him that
[1:13:13] he will command his children and his
[1:13:16] household after him, and they shall keep
[1:13:20] the way of the Lord to do justice and
[1:13:23] judgment, that the Lord may bring upon
[1:13:25] Abraham that which he hath spoken of
[1:13:28] him.
[1:13:29] &gt;&gt; Now, the children of Israel
[1:13:34] almost became everything the anti of
[1:13:37] that verse,
[1:13:38] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:13:39] The children of Israel rebelled. They
[1:13:41] constantly made mistakes. All even God's
[1:13:45] very finest made mistakes.
[1:13:47] &gt;&gt; You remember even Moses losing his
[1:13:50] temper, got kept out of the promised
[1:13:51] land. You you find what David did, what
[1:13:54] Solomon did. You you find all and
[1:13:56] Brother Bram talks about, you know, the
[1:13:58] the record of those with all of these
[1:14:00] blemishes in the record, and it almost
[1:14:02] seems like they wouldn't even qualify.
[1:14:04] But but none can deny that they were
[1:14:06] used of God. See, and he says there's
[1:14:09] many more with these serious problems in
[1:14:12] their lives than there ever was. People
[1:14:13] like Joseph who only had one little
[1:14:16] scratch that he kind of used a little
[1:14:17] bit of guile when his daddy was talking
[1:14:19] to Pharaoh and he and and he and and he
[1:14:21] wasn't really supposed to do that. And
[1:14:23] but of course his daddy being a prophet
[1:14:24] wouldn't wouldn't lie and he just told
[1:14:26] Pharaoh, "What do you do for a living?
[1:14:28] Your servant are shepherds?" Oh, Dad,
[1:14:29] don't tell him you're shepherds. That's
[1:14:31] an abomination to Egypt. So, you know,
[1:14:33] even Joseph was uh bending a little bit,
[1:14:36] feeling a little bit of political
[1:14:38] pressure, little bit of social anxiety,
[1:14:41] uh because, you know, kind of things I
[1:14:43] don't want to stand out on. But, but
[1:14:45] that was Joseph's only little thing, one
[1:14:48] little scratch. Oh, friends, I'm here to
[1:14:50] tell you something. God never changed
[1:14:53] his opinion. He never went back. There's
[1:14:55] not a verse 20 that says, "Until they
[1:14:57] start sinning and falling away and then
[1:15:00] I'm just going to be done with them."
[1:15:01] No, he says his household after him,
[1:15:03] they shall keep the way of the Lord.
[1:15:05] They shall do justice and that the Lord
[1:15:07] may bring upon Abraham that which he
[1:15:09] have spoken. I'm here to tell you, we
[1:15:11] got all of our problems. They had all of
[1:15:12] their problems. But God doesn't change
[1:15:14] his mind about what he says about you,
[1:15:18] about Abraham, about Israel, about
[1:15:20] David.
[1:15:22] &gt;&gt; Did they have flaws? Yes, they had them
[1:15:24] galore. But God never went back and
[1:15:26] amended his word. He didn't need to
[1:15:30] because he knew in the end his word
[1:15:32] would finally conquer.
[1:15:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. By the way, brother Brandham
[1:15:36] said Jesus never screamed at devils. He
[1:15:38] didn't have to scream at them. He knew
[1:15:40] that his words could not fail because he
[1:15:43] knew who he was. And he knew that
[1:15:45] someday his word would conquer.
[1:15:48] Hallelujah. Friends, we have arrived at
[1:15:49] a day when he is conquering a people's
[1:15:52] heart and minds to to the degree that
[1:15:55] it's going to have an unprecedented
[1:15:56] event and take a global bride and a body
[1:15:59] change and raise the dead for hundreds
[1:16:02] of years out of the grave.
[1:16:05] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:16:07] &gt;&gt; For I know him
[1:16:09] and I know his people after him.
[1:16:13] Verse 20. And the Lord said, "Because
[1:16:15] the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is great,
[1:16:18] and because their sin is very grievious,
[1:16:22] I will go down now and see whether they
[1:16:24] have done altogether, according to the
[1:16:26] cry of it which is come unto me, and if
[1:16:29] not, I will know."
[1:16:31] And the men turned their faces from
[1:16:33] then, and went towards Sodom. But
[1:16:36] Abraham stood yet before the Lord. And
[1:16:41] Abraham drew near
[1:16:43] and said, "Wilt thou also destroy the
[1:16:48] righteous with the wicked? Per venture
[1:16:51] there be 50 righteous within the city.
[1:16:53] Will thou also destroy and not spare the
[1:16:56] place for the 50 righteous that are
[1:16:57] therein?" Look at what he says. It's so
[1:16:59] audacious. I mean you think the audacity
[1:17:02] of this guy that be far from thee to do
[1:17:06] after this manner
[1:17:08] to slay the righteous with the wicked
[1:17:11] and that the righteous should be as the
[1:17:14] wicked
[1:17:16] that be far from thee? Shall not the
[1:17:20] judge of all the earth do right? I want
[1:17:23] you to know Abraham knows exactly who
[1:17:26] he's talking to. Oh yes.
[1:17:29] &gt;&gt; He knows. He knows the man that met him
[1:17:31] at the tent door was that's why he bowed
[1:17:34] to worship him. Called him Elohim,
[1:17:37] &gt;&gt; my Lord. Call him that name. And if you
[1:17:40] look back in the in the in the in the
[1:17:42] Hebrew, that name that he used for when
[1:17:45] he he referred to uh that one standing
[1:17:48] there, it is only exclusively, it's
[1:17:51] never any other way. It is used
[1:17:53] exclusively for the God of creation. He
[1:17:57] knew that this man that this was God in
[1:18:01] human form, not the one that met him on
[1:18:03] the road uh from the slaughter of the
[1:18:05] kings. That was God in a theophotic
[1:18:07] theophonic appearance, a prefigure of
[1:18:09] Christ. This wasn't just a prefigure of
[1:18:12] Christ. This was almighty God visiting
[1:18:14] him. We've had all kinds of prefigures
[1:18:18] down through the church ages, but we're
[1:18:19] promised in the last day that the very
[1:18:22] literal God will come down and dwell in
[1:18:24] flesh. And it won't just be a prophet.
[1:18:26] It'll be a whole people.
[1:18:28] &gt;&gt; It'll be the entire word uh filling up
[1:18:31] God's role of the Lamb's book of life.
[1:18:33] Oh, what an hour that we live in.
[1:18:39] So we see in Abraham's involvement with
[1:18:41] God's plan,
[1:18:43] it's actually he's part of the process
[1:18:46] for God to arrive at his ultimate
[1:18:48] vision. And that's a key part. So I want
[1:18:51] to say it again. Abraham knew this God
[1:18:54] because that's that's that's the desire
[1:18:56] that Paul says that I may know him.
[1:19:00] &gt;&gt; See, that I may know him in the
[1:19:02] fellowship of his sufferings being made
[1:19:05] conformable unto his death. See, if I
[1:19:08] might attain to the resurrection also.
[1:19:11] So, so we realize that this whole idea
[1:19:14] of So, I've connected the dot for you
[1:19:17] that that literally the same creative
[1:19:20] word that made you a believer is the
[1:19:23] same creative word that changed your
[1:19:25] nature, the same creative word that
[1:19:28] gives you understanding of who God is.
[1:19:30] And the world thinks they know who Jesus
[1:19:32] is. And they think they know what kind
[1:19:34] of a deity he is. And it shows in their
[1:19:36] life. And it shows in their churches
[1:19:38] that they don't understand him at all.
[1:19:41] &gt;&gt; He's not a swinging hipster. He's not a
[1:19:44] cool dude. He's the living God Almighty.
[1:19:47] And he he's holy and he's righteous.
[1:19:50] He's all powerful.
[1:19:52] &gt;&gt; He's to be revered. You're you're to
[1:19:54] come before him soberly. You're to come
[1:19:56] before him with thanksgiving.
[1:19:59] &gt;&gt; Not here to tell him what to do. I'm
[1:20:00] here to be like him.
[1:20:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. So th this is that this is what it
[1:20:07] done for Abraham. You can see it in the
[1:20:09] shadow in the type of the Old Testament
[1:20:11] in Genesis.
[1:20:13] It's why the entire gospels everything
[1:20:15] we preach can be preached right out of
[1:20:17] the book of Genesis. The entire book of
[1:20:18] Revelation can be preached right out of
[1:20:19] the book of Genesis. No one knew that
[1:20:21] until the seals were open and we could
[1:20:23] see it.
[1:20:25] So we we see then that that it's becomes
[1:20:28] part of God's plan and Abraham now
[1:20:33] drew near
[1:20:35] the other the the the angels to Sodom
[1:20:40] separated.
[1:20:41] &gt;&gt; They had a different mission.
[1:20:43] &gt;&gt; But Abraham, seven letter Abraham drew
[1:20:46] near.
[1:20:48] &gt;&gt; First of all, who's got the courage to
[1:20:49] do that? And then he put it upon himself
[1:20:52] to speak. Let me just speak. And then he
[1:20:55] gets to 40 and I'll speak once more. And
[1:20:58] it gets to 30, I'm gonna Don't be angry.
[1:21:00] I'm gonna speak once more. It gets to
[1:21:02] 20. Oh, let me just speak once more. And
[1:21:04] then he gets to 10 and he's still
[1:21:06] speaking. And every time he comes
[1:21:08] forward with a feeling in his heart, God
[1:21:13] agrees.
[1:21:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:17] &gt;&gt; Everything that Abraham thought, this is
[1:21:19] how it should be. God was like a man
[1:21:22] after my own heart. We think exactly
[1:21:25] alike. No wonder he could know that
[1:21:28] Abraham and Abraham's children, Hello,
[1:21:31] Abraham's children. He knew we'd believe
[1:21:33] the word. He knew we would think like
[1:21:35] him. He knew we would have a world view
[1:21:38] that is shaped by this.
[1:21:41] &gt;&gt; He knew we would love the word. He knew
[1:21:43] he wouldn't have to beg us to serve him
[1:21:46] or prod us to serve him or beat us to
[1:21:48] serve him. He knew our love would anchor
[1:21:50] in my heart and I'd say, "Lord God, I
[1:21:52] want to serve you every day of my life.
[1:21:54] I want to be just like you in every
[1:21:56] aspect."
[1:21:59] &gt;&gt; You don't get that just by the acquiring
[1:22:02] of knowledge and doctrine.
[1:22:05] &gt;&gt; That's why it has to be an experience.
[1:22:08] See? So, so I want you to understand
[1:22:12] that Abraham now, as do you, has an
[1:22:17] involvement.
[1:22:19] So, per adventure, you thought that I
[1:22:24] just need to go to church today. Why?
[1:22:26] Well, it's Sunday. It's, you know, a
[1:22:29] little after 10:00. The Sunday school
[1:22:31] starts. We better get moving. and you
[1:22:34] drove through traffic and you burned
[1:22:35] fuel and put wear and tear on your tires
[1:22:37] in your vehicle and you came in here and
[1:22:39] you sit here and you're sitting here
[1:22:41] still listening to a crazy man scream
[1:22:43] and yell and wave his hands.
[1:22:45] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:22:46] &gt;&gt; What are you nuts? So many better things
[1:22:49] you could be doing with your life. You
[1:22:51] could be out making money, honey.
[1:22:54] A lot of people are.
[1:22:57] &gt;&gt; But why why are we here? Because I have
[1:23:00] an involvement. Yes,
[1:23:01] &gt;&gt; there's some intrinsic knowing. There's
[1:23:03] some internal compass that tells me,
[1:23:06] "No, no, I I'm not just coming to
[1:23:08] church. I'm not just coming to a
[1:23:10] building. I It might not even be inside
[1:23:12] of these four walls. I'm I'm doing like
[1:23:14] Abraham. I'm moving near to God
[1:23:17] &gt;&gt; because there's something in me, a deep
[1:23:19] calling, a deep drawing me. I can't help
[1:23:22] that that or Roberts and Billy Graham
[1:23:25] went that way. I'm not that's not my
[1:23:27] message. My message is I'm Abraham.
[1:23:30] Seven letters. Abraham. I'm here to
[1:23:32] worship Elohim. I'm part. I've got a
[1:23:34] part of his name.
[1:23:37] &gt;&gt; The same H in Elohim is now in Abraham.
[1:23:40] The same H that's in Elohim is now in
[1:23:42] Sarah. Hallelujah, friends. And it it it
[1:23:45] changes our whole thinking. It changes
[1:23:48] the whole reason we're at church today.
[1:23:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:51] &gt;&gt; Because we're part of it. I'm actually a
[1:23:55] facilitator of the rapture.
[1:23:57] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:23:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. You're a facilitator of the
[1:24:00] resurrection. Absolutely. What brother
[1:24:03] taught us that when the headstone comes
[1:24:05] down and it comes down and connects with
[1:24:06] that body, he said the dead for hundreds
[1:24:09] of years will come right up out of the
[1:24:10] ground. That's you. That's you involved
[1:24:14] with him.
[1:24:15] &gt;&gt; See? So, so we see his involvement with
[1:24:20] God's plan. We see his involvement with
[1:24:23] the process for God to arrive at his
[1:24:27] ultimate vision. So I just simply say
[1:24:29] today, now it's our turn.
[1:24:32] &gt;&gt; Bride of the last day.
[1:24:34] &gt;&gt; Now it's our turn. Now it's your turn to
[1:24:37] become involved. It's your chance to
[1:24:39] step forward. It's your chance to not
[1:24:42] stay back. It's your chance to go
[1:24:43] forward and begin to speak and begin to
[1:24:46] pour your heart out. Because what you'll
[1:24:48] find is the more the closer you get to
[1:24:50] him and the more you have these heart
[1:24:52] heart-to-he heart talks, you'll find you
[1:24:54] love him more and more and more and more
[1:24:58] and you get so filled up with the love
[1:24:59] for him, it changes everything. You
[1:25:01] start overcoming things you never could
[1:25:03] overcome. You get strength you never
[1:25:05] knew you had. You find yourself and you
[1:25:07] find yourself soaring like an eagle
[1:25:09] you're supposed to be.
[1:25:12] &gt;&gt; It's when you don't step near him. Be a
[1:25:16] seed gene of God as you might be. Be b
[1:25:19] have it birthed by the Holy Spirit. But
[1:25:22] if you don't have your life stepping
[1:25:23] toward him, if all you ever do is step
[1:25:26] away from him and step toward if all you
[1:25:29] ever do is step toward an education, a
[1:25:31] career, friends, social media, politics,
[1:25:35] step toward recreation, step toward
[1:25:37] this, this that you'll never you'll
[1:25:40] never find that that life, that energy,
[1:25:43] that strength that that can satisfy you
[1:25:46] when you lay your head on your pillow at
[1:25:48] night and know that your life is walking
[1:25:50] in the order of God's
[1:25:52] There is nothing so satisfying to a
[1:25:55] Christian in his soul as to be able to
[1:25:58] close your eyes at night say, "Lord, I
[1:26:00] love you. I thank you for this life
[1:26:03] today. Tomorrow I'll go forward and I'll
[1:26:05] serve you again and you get a however
[1:26:07] much sleep you get and you wake up and
[1:26:09] you're still talking to him. Lord, good
[1:26:10] morning. I love you. I don't even want
[1:26:12] to put my feet on the floor until I say
[1:26:15] I love you and I want to serve you and I
[1:26:17] put my feet in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:26:19] on this floor. I'm here to do your will.
[1:26:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:23] &gt;&gt; This is what and only what will
[1:26:26] accomplish that is when you recognize
[1:26:29] your position and own your
[1:26:32] responsibility.
[1:26:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:34] &gt;&gt; To step near him and commune with him.
[1:26:40] So it's a kingdom of saints.
[1:26:43] kingdom of saints that were planted in
[1:26:45] the earth, born in sin, redeemed back to
[1:26:49] God, and have bodies like unto his
[1:26:52] glorious body. Brother Brandham says it
[1:26:54] like this astonishing statement. Who is
[1:26:57] this mazdc?
[1:26:58] And the one that left home only come to
[1:27:02] the earth to serve his purpose. Is that
[1:27:06] right?
[1:27:07] &gt;&gt; All right. Then after it's finished,
[1:27:10] it's brought back in a glorified state.
[1:27:13] It's matured and brought back again.
[1:27:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:19] &gt;&gt; Friends, what is the gospel about if I
[1:27:22] don't live with that knowledge? Why
[1:27:25] what's why am I here? I'm not here to
[1:27:28] just to just be on the earth. I have
[1:27:31] accepted a purpose. I have realized that
[1:27:33] I've had a name change like Abraham has.
[1:27:35] &gt;&gt; He no longer calls us just church. He
[1:27:37] calls us bride because we've been called
[1:27:40] out of a church. And you remember last
[1:27:42] week or the week prior, we found that it
[1:27:44] was illegal. It was against the word of
[1:27:46] God to ever go back and refer to Abraham
[1:27:48] as Abraham again. You you don't ever let
[1:27:51] the devil get you to confess anything
[1:27:53] other than you are the virgin uh virgin
[1:27:55] bride of the Lord Jesus Christ and stand
[1:27:58] perfect in his sight.
[1:28:00] &gt;&gt; Don't ever let your lips betray that.
[1:28:03] See?
[1:28:04] So, so we see then that that in the
[1:28:08] gospels
[1:28:09] when when Jesus comes to Matthew 13. All
[1:28:12] right, I've got about 15 minutes of
[1:28:14] regulation. You good?
[1:28:16] I shouldn't need more than that.
[1:28:22] So, when we when we come to Matthew 13,
[1:28:25] hey, let's have a look at that. Brother
[1:28:27] Mark, I think we'll put that up. Matthew
[1:28:29] 13. We're going to catch three verses.
[1:28:32] We're going to start at verse 36
[1:28:34] because in the in the Gospels now, we're
[1:28:37] going to see a further phase of this
[1:28:38] great plan because it was never going to
[1:28:41] be just Abraham. It's a coming kingdom.
[1:28:43] Remember, he said, "I know that he'll do
[1:28:44] it in all of his all of his seed after
[1:28:47] him." So, the gospels are there now. And
[1:28:50] now Abraham got a name change from
[1:28:52] Abraham to Abraham. That was a very
[1:28:55] significant event. Now the gospel's come
[1:28:57] forward and now it's going to really
[1:29:01] accelerate. We're going to ramp see
[1:29:03] God's plan begin to ramp up in Matthew
[1:29:05] 13 and uh we'll catch 36 37 and 38.
[1:29:10] Then Jesus sent the multitude away. He'
[1:29:13] just given the parable of the swer and
[1:29:15] went into the house and his disciples
[1:29:17] came unto him saying declare unto us the
[1:29:20] parable of the tears of the field.
[1:29:23] He answered and said unto them,
[1:29:27] he that sweth the good seed. Look how
[1:29:30] simple this is. He that sweth, so you've
[1:29:33] got a person seowing seed and it's good.
[1:29:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:37] &gt;&gt; Right? He that sweth the good seed is
[1:29:40] the son of man.
[1:29:42] &gt;&gt; Verse 30, verse 38. The field is the
[1:29:46] world. The good seed are the children of
[1:29:49] the kingdom, but the tears are the
[1:29:51] children of the wicked one. So when we
[1:29:54] when we look at that we can see that the
[1:29:57] gospels are continuing to develop our
[1:30:01] understanding more and more and more
[1:30:04] about how it's the divine word uh is is
[1:30:09] actually joined to creation. Now you
[1:30:12] remember we have already showed you that
[1:30:15] he the breath of God the same Hebrew
[1:30:19] letter that he used to change Abram's
[1:30:22] name to Abraham is the same thing he
[1:30:24] used to say let there be
[1:30:26] &gt;&gt; right so so now we're coming to the
[1:30:29] gospel and we're seeing that that that
[1:30:33] the that the gospel itself this divine
[1:30:35] word is actually part of the
[1:30:38] continuation of creation. Amen.
[1:30:42] &gt;&gt; It It's not a It's not a different
[1:30:44] power. It's not a different person. It's
[1:30:46] the same God, the same Jesus according
[1:30:49] to the book of Colossians that the
[1:30:51] everything that's made was made by him.
[1:30:53] John John chapter 1 declares the same
[1:30:56] thing. Colossians chapter 3 declares the
[1:30:57] same thing. That there's not anything
[1:30:59] made that he didn't make. See? And so
[1:31:02] now that same one that created it all,
[1:31:05] that changed Abraham is now here in the
[1:31:06] Gospels alive and he's giving us the
[1:31:09] revealed word. So I want you to the the
[1:31:11] point I want to make that you connect
[1:31:13] the dot to is that this creative power
[1:31:17] is attached to the word.
[1:31:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:23] &gt;&gt; So the only way to unlock its magic is
[1:31:26] to have the word revealed to you.
[1:31:30] &gt;&gt; The only way that work because God
[1:31:32] brother says when God spoke God actually
[1:31:35] had to have faith in his own word. And
[1:31:38] so how do you expect to gain the
[1:31:41] benefits of that same creative word? Do
[1:31:44] you think Abraham would have received
[1:31:46] the promise if he had doubted the word?
[1:31:50] &gt;&gt; The very fact that he believed the word
[1:31:52] literally nullified every mistake he
[1:31:54] would ever make past, present, and
[1:31:56] future. That he believed the word and
[1:31:58] that's what God was looking for. Because
[1:32:01] God knew faith in his word was the key.
[1:32:03] He believed his own word. Abraham
[1:32:05] believed his own word. You are a
[1:32:07] believer of his own word.
[1:32:10] &gt;&gt; There's no way to force God to give you
[1:32:12] eternal life. He gives you his word and
[1:32:15] the opportunity to receive it.
[1:32:19] &gt;&gt; And that doesn't conflict with
[1:32:21] predestination and election. As long as
[1:32:23] you're believing everything he has
[1:32:25] revealed to you, you'll get the reward
[1:32:26] of that faith in whatever order that is.
[1:32:29] The the judgment bar will reveal the
[1:32:31] order of things. You can see that in the
[1:32:33] book of Revelation. So you see many many
[1:32:36] categories of humanity and it was always
[1:32:40] their their position was election which
[1:32:43] was origin but the the fact that the
[1:32:45] thing that made it work for them was
[1:32:47] they believed the word in whatever form
[1:32:50] God revealed it. See so they they reaped
[1:32:53] the reward of that. So now as we are
[1:32:56] looking to see that this word is
[1:32:58] connected to creation. So just as God
[1:33:02] created the world by that same letter
[1:33:05] and formed Abraham's new identity with
[1:33:08] the same letter, then when you find
[1:33:11] Jesus in
[1:33:13] Luke 11 and he's he's saying a prophecy
[1:33:18] of the end time, make sure you all look
[1:33:22] back. Don't just come back here and look
[1:33:24] at me. Keep going all the way back to
[1:33:26] where it started and look back at
[1:33:28] Abraham. Thank you, Lord. What am I
[1:33:30] seeing? You're seeing the ministry of
[1:33:32] the son of man. You're seeing the word
[1:33:35] made flesh and a mortal man with all
[1:33:38] kinds of faults believed that ministry.
[1:33:41] &gt;&gt; And when you see that ministry again,
[1:33:44] you need to believe it.
[1:33:45] &gt;&gt; You need to accept that. And it'll
[1:33:47] create in you what it created in him.
[1:33:49] It'll be it'll operate in you. How it
[1:33:51] operated in me.
[1:33:53] &gt;&gt; And that same power that raised me will
[1:33:55] raise you.
[1:33:57] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. Friends, do you
[1:33:59] understand what God has done for us in
[1:34:00] this hour?
[1:34:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:04] &gt;&gt; See,
[1:34:06] &gt;&gt; so it's what it's how he's creating
[1:34:09] children of his kingdom. Both are both
[1:34:12] are acts of divine speech.
[1:34:14] &gt;&gt; What he said to Abraham, what he said in
[1:34:16] Genesis creating let there be when they
[1:34:18] asked Jesus what's what's with this
[1:34:20] parable, he said the sewer is the son of
[1:34:23] man. The seed he's sewing is good seed.
[1:34:26] The field is the world and the wheat are
[1:34:29] the children of the kingdom. They're the
[1:34:30] crop of the seed.
[1:34:34] &gt;&gt; Did Did Jesus go get a plow and start
[1:34:37] plowing? No. He sent his word.
[1:34:42] He sent it. He He came into the upper
[1:34:44] room and then they begin to take the
[1:34:46] word and it went down through the ages
[1:34:48] and God interceded for ignorance. But it
[1:34:50] come to the last day and now the days of
[1:34:53] Lot are back among us. And what does it
[1:34:55] do? It's the same word seowing the same
[1:34:58] seed and the same kind of people are
[1:35:00] believing it with the same kind of faith
[1:35:02] and getting the same kind of results.
[1:35:07] &gt;&gt; The result is new life just like Abraham
[1:35:09] became a new man. Just like the
[1:35:12] disciples were becoming part of a of a
[1:35:15] they were becoming part of a new a new a
[1:35:20] new segment of humanity. I can say it
[1:35:22] like that because if you'll remember
[1:35:25] that Jesus was uh he was a he was um
[1:35:32] he was unique.
[1:35:34] There had never been anyone in the earth
[1:35:38] like him.
[1:35:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:41] &gt;&gt; Melzdc was God in flesh, but Melzdc God
[1:35:44] just built a body and stepped in and
[1:35:45] stepped out of it and disassembled it.
[1:35:47] &gt;&gt; But that wouldn't redeem me and you.
[1:35:50] Jesus had to be born of a woman
[1:35:53] &gt;&gt; because a woman caused the fall. She was
[1:35:55] party to the fall. She didn't cause it.
[1:35:57] It was Satan that did it. And it was
[1:35:59] Adam that broke the world. But Eve was a
[1:36:02] participant in that.
[1:36:04] &gt;&gt; And so, so you realize now it's got to
[1:36:06] come back through the woman. He's got to
[1:36:09] be born. Only now he's born by a virgin
[1:36:12] birth so that he's not born in sin. But
[1:36:15] he is building a body made out of the
[1:36:16] cursed earth. That's why he ages. That's
[1:36:19] why he can get sick. That's why he could
[1:36:21] be killed.
[1:36:22] &gt;&gt; You can't kill God. You understand? So
[1:36:24] God acting out the part of death in
[1:36:27] Christ. Brother Ram said he acted out
[1:36:29] death in Christ. Now he really died.
[1:36:31] Jesus really died. He was really dead.
[1:36:34] But when the Roman even when he died,
[1:36:37] the life that that was in that original
[1:36:39] blood cell was still there because that
[1:36:42] was the continuation of what his body
[1:36:44] would be. And brother Brandham said when
[1:36:46] that Roman spear pierced his side, the
[1:36:48] tip of that spear pierced that original
[1:36:51] blood cell and released the bride.
[1:36:54] Hallelujah friends. Now it's all God can
[1:36:57] be all in all. He's redeeming his whole
[1:36:59] creation.
[1:37:01] &gt;&gt; His in Noah's day baptized the earth.
[1:37:04] His blood claimed the earth. And now his
[1:37:06] life is going to come in the church. And
[1:37:08] then he's going to redeem the earth.
[1:37:09] He's going to redeem you. He's going to
[1:37:10] redeem our bodies. We're going to a
[1:37:13] kingdom. Amen.
[1:37:15] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. That's why I'm a
[1:37:17] believer today. That's why you believe
[1:37:19] what you believe.
[1:37:21] &gt;&gt; That's why you're That's why you Oh,
[1:37:23] forward. If those kind of things aren't
[1:37:25] clear to you, then go to God. Do like
[1:37:28] Abraham. Go to God. Say, "Reveal this
[1:37:31] great that this what Abraham wanted.
[1:37:33] Abraham wanted to know um what what are
[1:37:36] you doing? Wait, what? You're you're
[1:37:39] you're going to what if there's 50
[1:37:43] people that are righteous?
[1:37:45] &gt;&gt; What if there's 40, 30, 20, 10?
[1:37:49] I would say to you today, if you don't
[1:37:51] understand things in the word of God,
[1:37:53] just do like your father did. Do like
[1:37:55] Abraham did. Just step near and just
[1:37:59] say, "Lord, what's up with my life?
[1:38:02] What's going on? What is this burning
[1:38:05] down inside of my heart? What is this
[1:38:07] deep I feel calling to deep? Oh friends,
[1:38:10] I hope you feel that today. I say,
[1:38:12] "Yeah, brother Jason, I responded to
[1:38:14] that a long time ago. I hope you want
[1:38:16] more and more and more and more and more
[1:38:20] and more and more and more of Jesus." I
[1:38:25] love that song they sing in Africa. More
[1:38:27] and more and more and more of him.
[1:38:32] Ah,
[1:38:34] nothing left of me.
[1:38:37] Nothing left of me. I want more and more
[1:38:42] and more and more of Jesus. That
[1:38:45] beautiful. More and more and more and
[1:38:49] more of him. Let's stand to our feet,
[1:38:52] friends. Oh, hallelujah. We love the
[1:38:55] Lord. I'm not going to try to carry on.
[1:38:58] I think we've made uh enough enough
[1:39:01] mileage today in the thought. There's
[1:39:03] more to say and uh we'll get to it. Um
[1:39:07] unless the rapture comes and then it'll
[1:39:09] we'll all we'll all understand it
[1:39:10] anyway. Amen. Praise the Lord.
[1:39:14] Hallelujah. I I look forward to the day
[1:39:18] when you and me won't have to, you know,
[1:39:22] get that hidden mana one week at a time.

[1:39:45] will be answered.
[1:39:48] &gt;&gt; There won't be no more why.
[1:39:50] He's going to answer the why. He said,
[1:39:52] "Ever all the things you wanted to know.
[1:39:56] Everything you've ever wondered at will
[1:39:58] be made known. It'll be revealed." He
[1:40:01] said, "Here we have a service, we hear
[1:40:05] preaching, we think it, oh, it's so
[1:40:07] good. It does are it just feels like
[1:40:10] we're having a gastronomical jubilee. He
[1:40:12] says, "But someday he and that word will
[1:40:16] become what you never dreamed possible."

[1:45:34] The weapon may be formed, but it won't
[1:45:37] prosper.
[1:45:40] &gt;&gt; I like that. When the darkness falls, it
[1:45:44] will prevail.
[1:45:47] &gt;&gt; Calls up the God I serve.

[1:46:31] for the battle
[1:46:33] belongs to you, Lord.
[1:46:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:38] &gt;&gt; Father, that battle belongs to you.
[1:46:42] It's always belong to you. I don't know
[1:46:45] sometimes, Lord, why we think we have to
[1:46:47] fight it on our own.
[1:46:50] Why we don't just come to you and do
[1:46:52] like Abraham and just step close and
[1:46:54] start talking. Lord, I pray today in
[1:46:57] this building and out across the
[1:46:58] airwaves, there's many children of God
[1:47:01] who know, Lord, they hear a they hear a
[1:47:05] high altitude sermon like this and they
[1:47:06] say, "My, I know I'm a part of that. I
[1:47:09] just wish I could feel what it feels
[1:47:11] like to live in those high atmospheres."
[1:47:14] Lord, it's not rocket science. It's not
[1:47:16] complicated. You have called us up
[1:47:18] higher. That was what John saw. A door
[1:47:21] was open in heaven. Come up higher,
[1:47:23] John.
[1:47:23] &gt;&gt; Praise God. Oh master, I pray today that
[1:47:28] each and every person, man, woman, boy,
[1:47:30] or girl, under the sound of my voice
[1:47:33] now, live here, across the stream,
[1:47:36] across the archives in days to come,
[1:47:38] Lord, may they take hope today. May the
[1:47:40] word of God
[1:47:42] begin a work that starts down inside
[1:47:45] their heart and begins to drive them
[1:47:46] closer and closer and closer until Lord,
[1:47:50] they become so lost in you, as the
[1:47:52] prophet said, Satan can't even find them
[1:47:54] anymore.
[1:47:56] We want that kind of victory. Lord, I
[1:47:59] want that kind of victory for me, for my
[1:48:03] family, for this church, for your bride.
[1:48:06] We know, Lord, that we're near the end.
[1:48:08] We we can see we understand modern
[1:48:10] events. They're made clear to us in
[1:48:12] prophecy. We're not here in fear, Lord
[1:48:15] God. We're here in faith. We can see the
[1:48:18] the what. We can see the why. We can see
[1:48:20] the how. We know what the plan is. So I
[1:48:24] pray, master, you give us the courage
[1:48:26] that we need to move forward. I don't
[1:48:28] think I could leave the people with
[1:48:30] anything of a better piece of advice
[1:48:33] just to say whatever's been in the past,
[1:48:36] forget it. Just step forward. Just step
[1:48:39] forward. Just move forward. Move close
[1:48:42] to him and start talking. I promise you
[1:48:45] he'll respond. Lord, we commit it to you
[1:48:47] today. Commit all these people into your
[1:48:50] hands, Lord, for the effect of the word
[1:48:52] to be upon their lives. And let it, Lord
[1:48:54] Jesus, be an effective thing on me.
[1:48:57] Lord, we desire not to just be one that
[1:49:00] preaches the gospel as Paul said. What a
[1:49:02] what a dreadful thing having put so many
[1:49:04] in the way then be set aside myself. May
[1:49:07] it never be. Lord, draw us closer to thy
[1:49:11] bleeding side. We commit it to you today
[1:49:13] in Jesus name. Amen. God bless you
[1:49:16] friends. It's been wonderful to have you
[1:49:18] in the house of God today. Turn around
[1:49:20] and shake hands with somebody standing
[1:49:22] near you. Amen. Praise the Lord. Say,
[1:49:25] "God bless you." Brother Ram said,
[1:49:26] "That's the nicest thing you can say to
[1:49:28] anybody is God bless you." Amen. Sing
[1:49:33] us. Sing us home, Brother Kenny. God
[1:49:34] bless you. You are worthy of it all.
