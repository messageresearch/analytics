TRANSCRIPT
========================================
a lot of this the adult Sunday school class was for was a good chance an opportunity to witness to our community to bring in friends or loved ones maybe that have never heard the message and so we we use it as a platform to be able just to teach straight from the Bible and from the message but to just to cover fundamental truths so for anyone streaming or watching we have a title today and our title is is the days of Miracles past that's our title so obviously I don't believe there's anyone in this audience who would say yes all of us would say no they aren't but we just want to establish something foundationally and I encourage you use this Sunday school as an opportunity to bring your friends or family or share an archive or a video of this I believe it could be a great blessing Mark chapter 16 what is three two verses here verse 17 and verse 18 and then we have some slides we want to get to and these signs verse 17 and Mark 16 and these signs shall follow them that belief in my name shall they cast out Devils they shall speak with new tongues they shall take up serpents and if they drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt them they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover you can be seated this morning I want to go straight to our slides and just bring something up that the prophet speaks about here and we're going to have just a lot of slides we look at today as we just lay a foundation for this this topic here today listen to what brother Branham says in the identified Christ of all ages he says so many people have different opinions of Christ as I travel in different parts of the country and around the world I find that so many people have their different opinions boy isn't that the truth today you'd be surprised to know what some of their opinions are some of them thinks that he's just a wonderful teacher remember this is the opinion of Jesus and brother random says some of them think that he's just a wonderful teacher well now he was he was that that's just exactly and many thinks that he was a great philosopher uh I might have went too far I apologize I did so let's read it again there at the end he says many people have different opinions he says some thinks he was a teacher he was that and many thinks that he was a great philosopher which he was that he certainly he was and then some of them think that he was a good man he was that but see he was more than that he was all of that plus that's an important comma and a word after he was all of that plus some of them think that he was a prophet he was a prophet but he was more than a prophet he was what the prophets was Plus see brother Brandon says so what how would we know now if he was teaching of his if he was teaching of his teachings he was a teacher and he was a great philosopher but the only way that we'll ever know today if we wanted to identify him today and I believe that he raised from the dead I believe that with all of my heart and I believe that he's promised here that he's the same yesterday today and forever and I am with thee always and I'll never leave thee nor forsake thee now those words listen to this now those words are they're either true or they're not true now this is a question that many in as brother Brandon says many have an opinion of who Jesus is so if you have an opinion of who Jesus is then when the scripture conflicts that opinion you have a choice you could either humble yourself to what the Bible says or you can explain it away now we're taking our topic here and the title is is the days of Miracles past the reason why we title that is that you'll find that here in our in what in our in our circles here you won't find that I don't believe there's any message believer uh who would ever even come close uh to to say and no to that answer of course we believe that Jesus is the same yesterday today and forever but in the religious world in the denominational and the non-denominational world the Evangelical World in fact all of the Protestant world you're going to have people who fall on different spots or different places on this question especially when you refer to Mark 16 and you refer to Miracles and the days of Miracles because logically in the human mind Miracles don't make sense logically to the brain to the mind right philosophically or in your in your rationale something that seems impossible yet we have at this church and churches around the world have recently and throughout history watched the supernatural take place and miracles take place Time and Time and Time and Time and Time Again and so but this this answer is brother Brandon says the different opinions that people have about Christ you'll always fall in this spot and you'll hear as brother Travis who's A brotherhood our church has testified when he was on a journey for the truth and he was he had read the god of the Bible he'd read the the book that brother Perry green wrote the acts of the Prophet but even before that he was reading the book of Acts he'd go to a youth leader and say where's this God uh you you're wonderful people you teach on the Lord Jesus but where's this God where's men that are filled with the baptism of the Holy Ghost it doesn't make sense that the Deacon is in church and then he takes a smoke break during church to go smoke a cigarette or they have a little social drink and and so to any normal person who hasn't been indoctrinated with religion something is not adding up here you're good people you love the Lord but and so Travis would get the same answer no matter where he went whether it was a pastor of of the of the large large church here in Beaufort to get the same exact question in fact the pastor of the largest church here in Beaufort told him Travis the days of the Apostles are over and the days of Miracles are over and that that's a Dallas Theological Seminary trained mind um and so listen to what brother Branham says here and that I think I want to key in on this statement brother Brandon says now those words what words he just read them I'm with thee always he's the same yesterday today and forever listen to what the prophet says here now those words they're either true or they're not true and if they're not true then what are we doing here tonight we're wretched people we're people that's well we're deceived the whole Christian world is deceived if he isn't the same yesterday today and forever if he isn't alive tonight and with us as he promised lo I Am With You Always even to the consummation that's the words of Jesus that the prophet is quoting here or the end of the world I'm with you always either that's true or it's not now if that isn't the truth then there's something wrong we are found false Witnesses not only are we making ourselves miserable under a false pretense but we are deceiving others we are found deceivers of something we're talking about which isn't if he's just a myth or just a historical what good is a historical Christ if he isn't the same today now what brother random was saying here is what good is good Bible teaching we could teach and we can teach and we can teach and we can learn and we can learn we can learn the original manuscripts and the languages and contextual things but what good is any of that if the author who wrote that isn't still alive today brother random says what good does it do to take your canary bird and feed him vitamins to make him pretty feathers good strong wings and then keep him in a cage now come on somebody this is this comes right down the home to us what good does it do all the teaching and all the preaching and all of the church entity if we just cage up that power in a cage somewhere brother Branham says what good is what good is a historical Christ if he isn't the same today what good is a god of Moses if he isn't the same God today what good does it do to take your canary bird feeding vitamins to make him pretty feathers good strong wings and then keep him in a cage see it doesn't do him any good and we talk about how great God was and then don't say he's the same today then there's something wrong we're caged up somewhere and that's a false conception of what God is so you have this line of thinking that comes into the church world to the religious world that there was a time that there was Apostolic gifts there was a time when there was Miracles we read about it in the book of Acts but the Bible says that God and sun dry times spoke to us through the prophets has now spoken to us through his son Jesus and so Jesus when he was on Earth he spoke everything that was to be said it's written down we follow the gospels we live life by the gospels and that's it there's no more solo scriptura is another uh uh you could call it a disposition or a belief of of nominal Evangelical churches here that means only in scripture and scripture alone and we would say to a degree of that amen but if he isn't the same today as he was then then what good is he we're wasting our times and making ourselves miserable for nothing and so so you have this idea that comes in and you'll find also the same exact scripture that to the the Paul said that though I speak with the tongues of men and angels though I have gifts though I have chair though I do all of these things give my body and yet I have not loved then all of that is is is is is pointless and mute and and worthless and so they take that to mean that see there all you need is love you don't need gifts you don't need you don't need Miracles you don't need any of these things and the Apostle Paul said that then that when that which is perfect has come then that which is in part shall be done away with and so they ex they take that scripture as to mean that now that Jesus has came then we don't need Miracles we don't need that the tongues we don't need gifts we don't need prophecy we don't need all of these gifts that Paul said in order in the book of Corinthians because we now have that which is perfect sadly there are some even in the message who would go as far as to say that we've received the perfect word and so now we don't need the apostolic gifts operated in the church so then I ask a question did the apostolic gifts end with the First with the end of the Bible I'll say it that way to simplify it did the apostolic gifts did Miracles end when the Bible was finished when the days of Peter was over when the days of Paul and John was over did the signs and wonders continue to accompany the first church hello let me keep your attention this is a critical Junction here you're going to be lost did the the gifts and the supernatural and the Miracles and the signs that Jesus said in Mark 16 these signs shall follow them that believe did they end with the death of the last Apostle well let's find out let's read some history this is 8155 to 160. Justin Martyr and this is in his dialogue with trifo I'm just going to read some of these are taken from quotations and I'm reading you these to show you just excerpts if you you couldn't go back we don't have a time machine to go back to Justin Martyr and and the ad155 so what do we have we have historical records that give you a sense or they give you an understanding of what did the church believe right are you with me you're following me listen to Justin Martyr for the prophetical gifts remain with us even to the present time so did they end with the last apostle Justin Martyr says for the prophetical gifts remain with us even to the present time this is his dialogue with trifo who is trying to suggest that the days of Miracles had ended with the apostles and he says the prophetical gifts remain with us listen here's ireneus irenaeus however you want to pronounce his name terti's messenger this is in the book against heresies Book 2 chapter 32. 81 this is 80 180. those this is so good I just wish I would if you want this PowerPoint you want to have it I can get it to you it's really good to study those who are in the truth his disciples receiving Grace from him do in his name perform Miracles so as to promote the welfare of other men according to the gift which each one has received from him for some do certainly and truly drive out Devils so they were still driving out devils in the days of irenius so that those who have thus been cleansed from evil spirits frequently both believing Christ and joined themselves to the church others have foreknowledge of things to come they see visions and utter prophetic Expressions others still heal the Sick by laying their hands upon them and they are made whole so what did irenius believe yay moreover listen to what he says here yea moreover as I have said the dead even have been raised up so again we'll come back to our question did the is the days of miracles did it end with the apostles Iranians didn't believe that Justin Martyr we found out didn't believe that notice he says and what share this is just as important I just want to stop here and say this is just as critical and important for me to bring you up historical teaching of water baptism we've done that here before and you could take pamphlets that we have in material to show you that after the apostolic after the days of the Apostles was over they still baptized in the name of Jesus Christ not titles but somewhere perversion misconstruing of scripture came in to give us the baptism in the name of the Father the Son and the Holy Ghost but the first church historically believed in baptism by Jesus name so this is just as important to show you this is what they believe the first church the early church listen he says and he says even the dead have been raised up and remained Among Us for many years and what shall I more say it is not possible to name the number of gifts which the church scattered through the whole world has received from God In The Name of Jesus Christ who was crucified under POTUS pilate in which she exerts day by day for the benefit of the Gentiles neither practicing deception upon any nor talk taking any reward from them on account of such miraculous inner positions for as she has received freely from God freely also does she minister to others for this reason let's get through irenius for this reason does the apostles declare we speak wisdom among them that are perfect determine those persons perfect who have received the spirit of God and who through the spirit of God do speak in all languages this is what iridius believed about those when Paul uses the term we speak among them that are perfect let's get some irenius's teaching terming those persons perfect who not just receive the spirit of God but speak in tongues as he used himself also to speak in like manner we do also hear many brethren in the church who possess prophetic gifts and who through the spirit speak all kinds of languages and bring to light for the general benefit the hidden things of men and declare the mysteries of God who also the apostles terms spiritual they be in spiritual because this is important they partake of the spirit they partake of the spirit what do we do in church we're partaking of the spirit they partake of the spirit here's tuturian 8208 let Martian this is his when he's challenging a heretic named marcion and marcion's Challenge and tuturian's challenges I want you to produce the same gifts and and visions and prophecies and interpretations and tongues as the Orthodox Church did this is his challenge to him let marcion then exhibit as gifts of his God some prophets such as have not spoken by human sense but with the spirit of God such as both predicted things to come and have made manifest the secrets of the heart for he quotes First Corinthians 14 25 let him produce a Psalm a vision a prayer First Corinthians 14 26 only Let It Be by the spirit in an ecstasy that is in a Rapture whenever an interpretations of tongues has occurred to him let him show to me also that any woman of boastful tongue in his community has ever prophesied from among those specially holy sisters of his now all these signs of spiritual listen to tutorial all these signs all these signs somebody say all he says now all these signs of spiritual gifts and they agree too with the rules and the dispensations in the instructions of the Creator therefore without doubt that Christ and the spirit and the Apostle belongs severally I'm sorry I missed the important part there let me back up now all these signs of spiritual gifts gifts are forthcoming from my side without any difficulty this is a man speaking about the gift the gifts interpretation tongues prophecies and he says they come from our side without any difficulty listen it's going a little bit further this is origin and may not pronounce these names right forgive me of Alexandria this is 8248 we're moving time's going forward here we have to say moreover that the gospel has a demonstration of its own more Divine than any established by Grecian dialects and this diviner method is called by the Apostle the manifestation of the spirit and of power of the spirit on account of these prophecies which are sufficient to produce faith in Anyone who reads them especially in those things which relate to Christ and of power because of the signs and wonders which we must believe to have been performed both on many other grounds and on this that traces of them that are still preserved among those who regulate their lives by the precepts of the Gospel and the and there are still preserved among Christians traces of that Holy Spirit which can appear in the form of a dove they expel evil spirits and perform many cures and foresee certain events according to the will of the logos so where did it change this is not just the Bible now now we've moved past the Bible and we have the tracing of the Holy Spirit operating in his church throughout the first church listen we'll go a little bit further origin of Alexandra and in the name of Jesus how many believe this can still how many can say can still remove distractions from the minds of men expelled demons take away diseases produce marvelous meekness of spirit I love how he interjects that right there not just the gifts not just expelling the but Jesus can also produce marvelous meekness of spirit and complete change of character and a Humanity of goodness and gentleness and those individuals who do not feign themselves to be Christian and some give evidence and some give evidence of their having received through this Faith a marvelous Power by the cures which they perform revoking no other name over those who need their help than that of God of all than that of the God of all things and of Jesus along with the mention of his history for by these means we too have seen many persons freed from Grievous calamities and from distractions of mine and Madness and countless other ills which could be cured neither by men nor Devils let me just say it Jesus is still the great physician he's still the Healer God desired to commend the doctrine of Jesus as a Doctrine which was to save Mankind and which was based indeed upon the apostles as foundations of the rising edifice of Christianity but which increased in magnitude also in the succeeding ages in which not a few cures and that means not not just a couple are wrought in the name of Jesus in certain other manifestations of no small moment have taken place here's Martin this is another church age messenger you'll recognize the picture there here's Martin three times the dead I'm just going to quote to you this three times the dead were raised in the ministry of Saint Martin here's just one account I'm going to read you one account while Saint Martin was away traveling for three days the unbaptized catacomb came down with the high fever or catch human however you want to say that came down with the high fever don't get stuck on the words keep reading with me his body lay lifeless in one of the cells awaiting burial Martin stretched forth him stretched himself at full length of the Dead Limbs and his departing brother just like Elijah he laid his body on him and after he stayed lying there sometime in prayer and had become aware through the spirit that the power of God was present he rose up for a short time and fixing his Gaze on the Dead Man's face he waited with confidence for the result of his prayer and the mercy of the Lord and after scarcely two hours how many would have given up after 30 minutes after scarcely two hours had passed he saw the dead men begin to move all of his limbs little by little and his eyes trembling and blinking as he recovered sight was the god of the Bible still active in the Church of Martin here's Columba here's another church AIDS messenger Columbus remembered as a missionary and a miracle worker belows just an excerpt of the Miracles of Columbus life wherever Columbo went he shared his mystical insights and spiritual visions introduced by the introduced the good news of the Gospel to pagans and offered pastoral counseling according to Adam and he performed Miracles too Healing The Sick killing a boar of amazing size merely by commanding it to die Where You Are spoke to a boar a pig die where you are don't say that to anybody just to wild pigs drawing water from a stone this was Columba drawing water from a stone and tussling cigar the days of Miracles are passed brother Travis that the age ended with the apostles uh-uh this is tussling successfully with Pagan Wizards once the saint was accompanied by a bright column of fiery light like the pillar of Fire who else was accompanied by a great pillar of light he was a company this is not brother Brandon I'm not saying this I'm reading you straight out of History he was accompanied by a column of fiery light that sounds just like the picture that we have of God's Prophet with the pillar of fire appearing over his head that preceded the Israelites in the book of Exodus Exodus and if that wasn't protection enough he could call upon the support of Holy Angels if he could so could we here's Cyril I'm just got a few more Cyril of Jerusalem and though he's one in nature yet many are the virtues by which this is 8350. we're moving forward let's go past it getting closer to us why but it's the will of let me start over and though he is one in nature yet many are the virtues which by the will of God in the name of Jesus Christ he works for he employs the tongue of one man for wisdom the soul of another he enlightens by prophecy to another he gives power to drive away Devils to another he gives to interpret the Divine scriptures Augustine of Hippo this is notes from the city of God in 426 in his book city of God Augustine dedicates an entire chapter to the continuation of Miracles indignant at the suggestion that they ceased with the apostles so that Spirit was already working he claimed to have witnessed a number himself enlist an extraordinary range of healings from blindness rectal fistula breast cancer gout paralysis hernia demonization and even death I sometimes say if some of these historical men were to come in some Churches would they recognize that as even being a Christian Church you understand this is what identified a Christian Church not a man teaching buying a Pulpit and just reading the scroll and telling you the theology wasn't what identified a Christian Church what identified them was that Christ was among them here's my summary we have the witness of Justin irenius tatorian origin and Spruce I didn't even give you some of these um uh these I didn't read all of these basal Cyril Augustine we have a massive spread listen close we have a massive spread chronologically from the mid second century to the early 5th Century that shows a charismatic church of Visions tongues interpretation of tongues killings Miracles and geographically all the way from the Far East if I were to show you a map and I wanted to show you where these men were located it wasn't in one spot it was all across the globe we have the witness of all of these men's of Visions tongues interpretations geographically all the way from the East to the far west of the Empire and north and south of the Mediterranean brother Branham says in the sardisian church age two more quotes and we'll close now Paul had baptized in Jesus name and re-baptized where people had not been so immersed he set the church in order and taught the proper use of the gifts of the Spirit and confirmed that they were to remain in the church until Jesus came amen thus the next that was Paul thus the next Messengers we just read all about the next Messengers thus the next Messengers all the remaining six would be would by the same Holy Ghost burn with the same fire and give the same light of the Gospel of Jesus Christ and signs would follow them did irenius qualify say it yes did Martin did Columbus did Martin Luther most assuredly brother random says did Wesley yes sir he had a great ministry and even prayed for his horse to get well and it did there you are seven Church ages and seven Messengers who were alike and Paul pronounced a curse on anyone who said he was a messenger but had a different gospel and lived in a different light let's stand Lord we give you thanks for your word it burns down within us Lord father we're a church Lord who wants to be identified not Lord by some Creed or theory of man or doctrine or name or title but we want to be identified by the moving of your spirit that's alive today moving in word moving in fruits moving in gifts Let It Be Lord I pray God in Jesus name amen
