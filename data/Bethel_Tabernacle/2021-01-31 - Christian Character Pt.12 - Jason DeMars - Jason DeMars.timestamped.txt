[2:09] good morning everyone god bless you
[2:11] let's stand and pray
[2:15] heavenly father we just come to you lord
[2:17] and we ask that you would take your word
[2:19] this morning and make it living and
[2:23] and real lord may meet us right where
[2:25] we're at
[2:27] father and and touch our hearts draw us
[2:30] closer to you lord
[2:31] may we each one step out of the way that
[2:34] your spirit could flow through
[2:36] us and that you would be glorified in us
[2:38] father
[2:39] we ask these things in the name of jesus
[2:41] christ amen
[2:43] all right we're going to look at our
[2:44] opening scripture isaiah 14
[2:48] 13-15 i'm going to be speaking on
[2:51] christian character part 12
[2:53] and looking at humility for the second
[2:56] time
[3:00] for thou has said in thine heart i will
[3:02] ascend into heaven
[3:04] i will exalt my throne above the stars
[3:06] of god i will sit
[3:08] also upon the mount of the congregation
[3:11] in the sides of the north
[3:13] i will ascend above the heights of the
[3:15] clouds i will be like the most high
[3:17] yet thou shall be brought down to hell
[3:20] to the sides
[3:21] of the pit and then genesis
[3:24] chapter 3 verses 4
[3:27] and 5. and you can pull that up in the
[3:31] our regular king james version i am
[3:33] going to read it from
[3:35] the english standard version
[3:38] very similar but a little bit different
[3:41] emphasis but the serpent said to the
[3:43] woman
[3:44] you will not surely die for god knows
[3:48] that when you eat of it your eyes will
[3:50] be opened and you will be like god
[3:52] knowing good and evil you will be
[3:56] like god where it's translated in the
[3:59] king james as
[4:00] uh gods it's from the word elohim
[4:04] it's speaking that they will be like god
[4:07] so may the lord have the blessing to the
[4:09] reading of his word you can be
[4:12] seated
[4:15] so you will be like god it's very
[4:18] interesting that satan
[4:20] uses that in the temptation
[4:23] of the woman when it was the very thing
[4:26] that got him
[4:27] he wanted to be like the most high
[4:32] only no doubt there was a great jealousy
[4:34] that was taking place there because
[4:36] weren't they already like the most they
[4:38] were made in his image and likeness
[4:41] right so he was offering something she
[4:44] already had
[4:47] and what what what was it she was
[4:49] deceived right
[4:50] she didn't really comprehend
[4:53] precisely what was happening she was
[4:56] deceived
[4:56] into thinking it was a good thing
[5:00] well we're made in the image of like the
[5:01] likeness of god so if i do this i'll be
[5:03] more like god
[5:04] so let's go for it and
[5:10] it it dealt with what pride so we're
[5:13] talking about humility
[5:15] what is the opposite of humility it's
[5:17] pride
[5:18] they're two they're two things that go
[5:20] directly together and diametrically
[5:22] opposed
[5:24] to each other pride is the root of the
[5:26] first sin
[5:27] in heaven and pride is the root of the
[5:30] first sin
[5:31] on earth okay
[5:34] so then humility must be a root of
[5:37] something as well
[5:39] it seems to me that humility is the root
[5:42] of
[5:42] all godly holy
[5:46] character being holy
[5:49] means being humble
[5:53] andrew murray writes this the root of
[5:56] all virtue and grace of all faith and
[5:58] acceptable worship
[6:00] is that we know that we have nothing but
[6:02] what we receive
[6:04] and bow in deepest humility to wait upon
[6:07] god for it that's the
[6:10] root of all virtue and grace we have
[6:12] nothing i am nothing
[6:14] we have nothing everything that we have
[6:17] comes from god any good that i have
[6:20] accomplished
[6:21] is not me it's him
[6:25] and i have no reason to think i'm extra
[6:28] special because of it
[6:29] or i'm better than other people because
[6:32] of it
[6:33] it causes us to bow in deepest humility
[6:36] to say
[6:37] god hath wrought this
[6:41] let's define humility
[6:44] in ethics freedom from is from webster's
[6:47] dictionary an ethics
[6:48] it's freedom from pride and arrogance
[6:50] humbleness of mind
[6:52] a modest estimate of one's own worth
[6:55] in theology humility consists in
[6:58] lowliness of mind
[6:59] a deep sense of one's own unworthiness
[7:02] in the sight of god
[7:04] self-abasement penitence for sin and
[7:07] submission to the divine
[7:09] will how's that for a dictionary
[7:13] that's that's the original noah
[7:16] webster's
[7:17] dictionary that that's coming from so
[7:21] i believe humility is often
[7:24] an overlooked characteristic of a
[7:26] believer we talk about
[7:27] love we talk about submission
[7:31] we we talk about the fear of the lord
[7:36] we talk about kindness etc
[7:39] but i think the root of all of that
[7:44] starts with humility
[7:47] if we don't have if we're not humble
[7:50] if we have pride any goodness that we
[7:54] have is actually corrupted
[7:57] any good thing that we attempt to do
[7:59] becomes
[8:00] corrupted and you know we we tend to
[8:04] look at things in stark
[8:05] contrast someone's proud as an
[8:07] unbeliever he's proud he's an unbeliever
[8:10] right we're not talking necessarily in
[8:13] that sense you can be
[8:15] a good solid christian you can be a
[8:18] solid
[8:19] preacher and struggle with pride
[8:23] we're not we're not talking about hey
[8:26] we're
[8:26] you all you're humble i'm just patting
[8:28] you on the back
[8:30] i'm humble i'm patting myself on the
[8:31] back no i'm talking about
[8:33] us as christians have
[8:37] pride to fight and battle against
[8:41] constantly satan will always give us a
[8:44] counterfeit
[8:45] to what is real we can go forward and we
[8:49] can be in love and take pride
[8:51] in the love that we have we can
[8:54] be kind and take pride in the kindness
[8:58] that we have
[8:59] but what does it really do with that it
[9:02] actually corrupts
[9:03] every single thing that we do and in
[9:05] god's sight it's a
[9:07] because the the sacrifices that we make
[9:10] become a stench
[9:12] and so in the christian walk think of
[9:15] pride and humility
[9:16] as a a a spectrum
[9:20] as a temperature a gauge you have
[9:23] zero and then it goes down goes down to
[9:27] whatever negative 30 or something
[9:29] negative 35
[9:30] and it goes up to 120. so this is a
[9:33] gauge you know as you
[9:35] fill yourself more up with pride it gets
[9:38] hotter and hotter and hotter
[9:40] but as you empty yourself in that
[9:43] thermometer as you empty yourself it
[9:46] gets you get more and more humble
[9:48] and we all can be in a different stage
[9:51] in our walk in a different place in our
[9:55] walk
[9:55] and so the issue is not
[9:58] i'm i'm a christian so i'm of course
[10:01] empty
[10:02] of any pride oops
[10:05] probably just come out again oh my
[10:08] so what is pride pride is inordinate
[10:12] self-esteem an unreasonable conceit of
[10:16] one's
[10:16] own superiority in talents beauty
[10:19] wealth accomplishments rank or elevation
[10:22] in office office
[10:24] which manifests itself in lofty heirs
[10:27] distance reverence and often in contempt
[10:31] of others pride is demanding something
[10:34] from other people
[10:36] it's really demanding submission
[10:38] reverence
[10:39] from other people toward it needs this
[10:41] was what needs to come towards me
[10:43] you've got to respect me because
[10:47] my christian accomplishments god doesn't
[10:50] care for that
[10:52] it don't it means nothing to god what
[10:55] your accomplishment
[10:56] accomplishments are i mean think about
[10:59] what how the prophet talks about
[11:02] great and grand orators and preachers
[11:06] as compared to that little humble woman
[11:08] who cleared out her chicken coop
[11:11] to have a revival in it and she did
[11:13] spent all her money and
[11:15] did all she could and it brought one
[11:17] convert and that was a great thing
[11:19] in the sight of god so it isn't about
[11:22] having a position a place being
[11:25] recognized
[11:27] that's not how we're supposed to live
[11:28] and walk and act
[11:30] none of that matters to god if that
[11:33] mattered to god he never would have cast
[11:35] satan down to hell
[11:36] he was right next to god's throne
[11:40] no one could claim a greater degree
[11:43] of position than lucifer
[11:48] the angel of light the the anointed
[11:50] cherub that covers the presence of god
[11:52] yet he was cast down to hell why because
[11:55] he said i will
[11:57] i will what is humility
[12:01] means it's if god wills
[12:04] i'm going to do what god wants me to do
[12:08] it's submission to him
[12:11] so again pride and humility is a
[12:13] measurement of
[12:15] self i'm going to read andrew murray
[12:17] again he says here is the path
[12:19] to the higher life down
[12:22] lower down just as the water always
[12:25] seeks and fills the lowest place so the
[12:27] moment god finds men
[12:29] abased and empty his glory and power
[12:32] flow
[12:33] in to exalt and to bless
[12:38] let's read first peter 5 verse
[12:41] 5.
[12:45] likewise you younger submit yourselves
[12:49] unto the the elder yea all of you be
[12:52] subject one to another
[12:55] and here's the part i want to emphasize
[12:57] and be clothed with humility for god
[13:00] resisteth the proud
[13:02] but giveth grace to the humble
[13:06] so we're going to stay on that verse um
[13:10] to be clothed with something as a figure
[13:13] of speech to mean that you are to become
[13:15] that thing you're clothed with
[13:19] right clothed with humility so the word
[13:22] clothed there from the greek it speaks
[13:25] of
[13:26] an ornamental garment
[13:29] tied with knots or bows
[13:33] which can signify a lot of different
[13:34] things but in particular
[13:36] it's looking at the outer garment of a
[13:39] servant
[13:40] which is intended to be as a guard over
[13:43] the top of their normal
[13:45] daily garment and it identifies them
[13:49] as a servant right
[13:53] so when someone would see them in
[13:54] society they would immediately say
[13:56] this is a servant so us being clothed
[13:59] with humility what does it speak of
[14:02] that garment of humility that we put on
[14:04] identifies
[14:05] us as a servant of jesus christ
[14:10] so we want to put on this garment we
[14:12] want to be clothed
[14:14] with humility not clothed with pride
[14:18] and our life speaks our life speaks
[14:21] exactly what we are
[14:22] regarding that you can't help it a
[14:25] person that's full of pride it's
[14:27] so easy to recognize person that's
[14:30] humble
[14:30] it's easy to recognize as well
[14:35] and then he says for god this is a quote
[14:40] of proverbs
[14:44] i believe proverbs chapter 3 i didn't
[14:46] write it down
[14:47] proverbs chapter 3 verse 34
[14:50] maybe something like that for god
[14:52] resists the proud
[14:54] but gives grace to the humble so
[14:58] he resists the proud
[15:02] the word really resists doesn't fully
[15:06] speak of what's happening there
[15:09] the word resist from the
[15:12] thayer's greek dictionary says
[15:15] to range in battle against
[15:19] so think about that god resists the
[15:21] proud
[15:23] god actually girds himself puts his
[15:25] sword on his side
[15:27] and but not only that the word range
[15:30] means to set
[15:31] in a row or in rows to place in a
[15:34] regular
[15:35] line lines or ranks to range men or
[15:39] ships in the order of
[15:40] battle so he's ranging he's
[15:44] he's literally assembling a heavenly
[15:48] military with him leading it
[15:53] against the proud
[15:56] that's the danger of pride is that now
[15:59] you have
[16:00] god as an enemy
[16:03] okay now in the christian
[16:06] experience god can never truly
[16:09] be your enemy right he loves you
[16:14] but in our experience we can come to
[16:17] this place of pride
[16:19] where everything that we do has god
[16:21] resisting in other words you're lacking
[16:23] his blessing upon what you're doing
[16:25] and you're facing continual constant
[16:29] frustration of your plans
[16:33] and designs and in a way that's got
[16:36] really that's god's love that's god's
[16:40] love to
[16:41] hedge you in and hem you into the right
[16:43] way
[16:44] but if we if we continue in the wrong
[16:47] way
[16:48] god is going to take us off the scene
[16:51] you don't lose your salvation but
[16:55] you definitely lose god's blessing in
[16:57] this
[16:58] his temporary blessing in this life
[17:01] you don't ever lose god's eternal
[17:03] blessing
[17:04] but you get into this place where man
[17:06] everything i do is just
[17:07] in ruination you know and
[17:11] in a bigger picture the world
[17:15] pride god arrays himself against
[17:19] those who lift themselves up in
[17:22] pride but giveth grace to
[17:27] the humble james 4 6 says
[17:30] but he giveth more grace wherefore he
[17:32] saith god resisteth the proud
[17:34] but giveth grace unto
[17:37] the humble so when he's saying he
[17:39] resists the proud but gives grace to the
[17:41] humble
[17:42] i don't think this is talking about the
[17:44] grace that brings you salvation
[17:47] right because no one can actually be
[17:50] humble
[17:51] until god changes your heart so this
[17:54] isn't talking about
[17:55] this is talking about us in the
[17:56] christian experience
[17:59] he giveth more grace we increase we grow
[18:03] in grace we
[18:03] grace is multiplied peter says in
[18:07] another place
[18:08] and so we want grace to be multiplied
[18:11] right we want to experience
[18:12] more grace he giveth more favor
[18:16] grace means god's unmerited favor that
[18:19] he gives to us
[18:20] he giveth more grace so in the christian
[18:22] experience god
[18:24] resists the proud but gives grace
[18:28] to the humble there's no way to get
[18:31] humble
[18:31] unless god changes your heart by nature
[18:34] you're not
[18:35] humble now there's degrees and lengths
[18:38] of that of course just as there's
[18:40] degrees of uh
[18:42] there's adolf hitler and then there's
[18:45] someone who's good all their life but
[18:47] never repents
[18:49] never lives for god maybe they drink and
[18:51] smoke and so forth
[18:53] there's levels of what i'm talking about
[18:56] and
[18:56] and yet the reality is you can't
[18:59] truly be a god-centered humility
[19:03] unless he changes your heart
[19:10] so again continued grace we want
[19:13] continued grace
[19:15] we want multiplied
[19:18] grace not just temporary things
[19:22] like homes and cars and things those are
[19:24] those are just side
[19:26] side things that we appreciate we thank
[19:28] god for they all come from his hand
[19:30] but we're not looking for that really
[19:32] we're looking for spiritual blessings in
[19:34] heavenly places in christ jesus
[19:37] and so when god resists the proud it
[19:39] means you're going to stop growing
[19:41] you're going to stop moving on you're
[19:43] going to stop advancing in your
[19:44] christian walk you're going to stay
[19:46] exactly stagnated right there until you
[19:49] humble yourself
[19:51] and then when you humble yourself he
[19:53] giveth more grace
[20:00] isaiah 66 1 and 2.
[20:07] thus saith the lord the heaven is my
[20:09] throne and the earth is my footstool
[20:12] where is the house that you build unto
[20:14] me and where is the place
[20:16] of my rest for all those things hath
[20:19] mine hand
[20:20] made not only has he made him he owns
[20:24] them
[20:25] and all those things have been saith the
[20:27] lord
[20:28] but to this man will i look he didn't
[20:30] change subjects he's talking about
[20:32] where's the place of my rest
[20:34] where do i where do i make my dwelling
[20:36] place
[20:37] this man will i look even to the hymn
[20:40] that is poor
[20:41] that word poor is humble lowly
[20:46] and of a contrite literally means a
[20:48] smitten spirit
[20:51] and trembles at my
[20:54] word so
[20:57] we want god to live in us we want to
[21:00] experience his presence
[21:02] more and more right how do you want to
[21:05] experience his present
[21:07] presence more and more humble yourself
[21:11] be contrite but not only that tremble
[21:16] have it means speaks of reverence have a
[21:18] reverence have a trembling
[21:21] at his word we don't just treat it like
[21:22] it's
[21:25] common it's not common god's
[21:29] god's word means should mean everything
[21:31] to us
[21:32] and it should give us such we should
[21:34] have such a reverence for it
[21:36] that when we read it and we find that we
[21:38] don't line up with it we should tremble
[21:42] why because we never want to displease
[21:44] the lord
[21:45] we never want to find him
[21:50] a rang an army of heaven against
[21:53] us humble
[21:57] contrite trembles at his word god is
[21:59] spirit
[22:02] he he can't dwell just in one place god
[22:04] is spirit
[22:05] he do he cove covers all space and time
[22:07] the prophet said heaven
[22:09] and the heaven of heavens cannot contain
[22:11] thee
[22:12] the scripture says
[22:15] and it's not about it's not about
[22:18] temples and
[22:19] churches and having a big big place to
[22:23] worship in
[22:24] beautiful everything's up to date
[22:27] perfect
[22:28] that's not what god is looking for might
[22:30] be what we're looking for
[22:32] but god is not looking for that at all
[22:35] what is he looking for someone that
[22:37] worships him in spirit and in truth
[22:39] stumble that someone that's
[22:41] humble contrite trembles at the word
[22:45] where is he looking to dwell in humble
[22:49] hearts humble hearts
[22:54] brother branham says this and humble
[22:55] thyself
[22:57] in july 1963
[23:01] you show me a church that's humble real
[23:03] humble humble
[23:04] not arrogancy a church just a sweet
[23:08] humble church i'll show you a church
[23:10] that has the favor
[23:11] and power of god in it that's right
[23:15] that's the thing it takes humility
[23:18] humbling ourselves before god
[23:20] letting god just work through us don't
[23:23] have to make a lot of noise
[23:25] sometimes as the farmer said he went out
[23:27] to the field with his wagon and every
[23:28] time he hit a bump
[23:30] it just rattled and went on but he come
[23:32] back he hit the same bump and didn't
[23:33] make no noise at all because it was
[23:36] loaded with good things
[23:39] so i think that's just about right see
[23:41] we that we just get filled up with the
[23:43] good things of god
[23:44] that the fruit of the spirit might be
[23:46] known
[23:48] through us what is he talking about the
[23:51] fruit of the spirit i was expecting him
[23:53] say the gifts of the spirit
[23:55] but he said the fruit of the spirit what
[23:57] is the fruit of the spirit
[23:59] the character of jesus christ
[24:02] it don't have to make a lot of noise it
[24:04] might make noise it might make not
[24:06] might not make noise it might be
[24:10] it might be you shout and scream but it
[24:12] might be
[24:13] yours you can't say a word because
[24:16] you're so
[24:17] convicted in the presence of god
[24:20] there's a balance to all of it be still
[24:23] and know that i am god
[24:25] be still you don't have to jump and
[24:28] shout and run around just be still and
[24:30] know
[24:31] that he is god get yourself under him
[24:35] there's nothing against shouting that's
[24:37] not brother branham saying don't shout
[24:40] don't say amen don't say hallelujah
[24:42] don't
[24:43] because you're not supposed to sit like
[24:44] a bump of the log the word of god should
[24:46] can
[24:46] should make you excited and happy but
[24:48] other times the word makes you tremble
[24:51] and you can't say a word the point is
[24:54] let
[24:54] the let god move
[24:57] let him fill you with good things
[25:00] so that you go along the road steady
[25:04] right i'd rather be steady
[25:07] than to be emotionally up and down in
[25:10] this way and that way
[25:12] steady in the center of god's word
[25:17] we can i love shouting i love saying
[25:20] amen i'm not speaking against that
[25:22] but i'm saying there's priorities
[25:26] living the word is the priority
[25:29] you can mimic any of those outward
[25:32] things
[25:33] but you're not going to mimic the
[25:36] character of jesus christ
[25:38] truly you're not going to mimic or mimic
[25:40] the word living
[25:42] in the bride producing the character of
[25:45] jesus
[25:46] christ and the works of jesus christ
[25:49] and it comes from what being humble
[25:52] humble yourselves we want the power of
[25:54] god moving in this church right
[25:57] we're desperate for it we want that
[26:01] in every life we want the power of god
[26:04] going out to the people that have left
[26:07] the church that have said bad things
[26:10] about us
[26:11] that have turned against us we want to
[26:13] see them
[26:15] repenting we want to see them living for
[26:18] god
[26:18] loving god why do we want to see that
[26:20] because we love those people
[26:23] we want to see the best for them not
[26:25] because we want seats full
[26:27] but we want people loving
[26:30] serving steady amen
[26:34] in the reality of jesus christ
[26:39] matthew 11 29 and 30.
[26:44] take my yoke upon you take my yoke upon
[26:48] you this is
[26:49] directly a jewish
[26:53] saying from the rabbis they talk about
[26:56] taking
[26:57] two different yokes in order in order to
[26:59] take the yoke of the commandments you
[27:01] have to take the yoke of the kingdom
[27:03] so you take the yoke of the kingdom then
[27:04] you can take the yoke of the
[27:05] commandments
[27:06] and jesus is saying i got something else
[27:09] for you
[27:10] i got something new for you i got a
[27:12] different yoke for you
[27:13] that's totally distinct from this other
[27:15] yoke this yolk that's heavy
[27:18] that's that the the pharisees and the
[27:20] sadducees they put upon this
[27:22] heavy yoke upon you
[27:25] and it's not light and it's burdensome
[27:29] and it's impossible for you to carry it
[27:32] and not only that
[27:32] no one is helping you carry it it's all
[27:35] up to you
[27:37] so what does jesus say take my yoke upon
[27:40] you
[27:42] learn of me not the rabbis
[27:45] not all not all the rabbinical writings
[27:48] from the last 500 years he's saying
[27:50] but take my yoke what is it what is a
[27:54] yolk
[27:55] you everybody knows what a yolk is you
[27:57] buy you bring two
[27:58] oxen together to pull something
[28:02] so he's saying take my yoke come on i'll
[28:05] pull with you
[28:07] learn of me i'm the expert here i know
[28:09] what i'm doing i know how to
[28:11] i know how to do it so come come next to
[28:14] me
[28:15] i will help you pull this new yoke
[28:21] for i am meek for i am meek
[28:24] i'm humble and lowly in heart
[28:28] and you shall find rest for your souls
[28:32] jesus christ is our first example of
[28:34] what it means to be humble
[28:36] he said i do nothing of mine own self
[28:40] he said my word is not my own he says
[28:44] the miracles you see it's not me doing
[28:46] them it's the father that dwells in me
[28:48] he was humble he submitted himself
[28:54] he said i can do nothing of mine own
[28:57] self that is what
[29:00] it means to be humble i can do nothing
[29:02] of myself
[29:04] i have nothing of myself everything that
[29:07] i do
[29:08] have and do it's him so let's take that
[29:11] yoke
[29:13] upon ourselves it's not what we can do
[29:15] and get up and we can speak this and we
[29:17] can do that
[29:19] and of course those things are true we
[29:21] can speak
[29:22] but we don't speak of our own self we
[29:25] don't speak of our own will
[29:27] we're not speaking money into our bank
[29:30] account for
[29:30] selfish reasons we're believing
[29:34] god to provide for our needs we're
[29:37] walking with him
[29:38] brother branham told us exactly what it
[29:41] was
[29:41] to speak the word his experience i was
[29:45] wondering about that scripture
[29:47] what do you need squirrels
[29:51] speak the squirrels did william branham
[29:53] come up with the idea
[29:57] did he just go out and start speaking
[29:58] stuff into existence
[30:00] every time the spoken word came he was
[30:03] prompted to do it
[30:05] amen don't get confused
[30:09] can you can you speak the word sister
[30:12] can you speak the word
[30:13] you can when god tells you to
[30:16] can i speak the word yes when god
[30:20] commands me to i've seen it
[30:23] i've seen god do it it's the absolute
[30:26] truth
[30:27] but we're talking about humility here
[30:29] we're talking about the yoke
[30:31] of jesus christ meek and lowly
[30:34] not high and lofty and proud meek and
[30:37] lowly i'm nothing
[30:39] i have nothing but such as i have give i
[30:43] thee
[30:44] in the name of jesus christ
[30:47] and what what will we find what will we
[30:51] find when we take this yoke
[30:53] upon us this yoke of humility and
[30:56] meekness
[30:57] meekness is not weakness meekness means
[30:59] you're able to be led of god
[31:03] moses was the mecus he wasn't weak there
[31:06] was nothing weak
[31:07] about moses when god dealt with him and
[31:10] spoke with him
[31:11] moses was meek in other words he did
[31:13] nothing he spoke nothing
[31:16] until god told him to do it
[31:19] so we want that yoke upon ourselves
[31:22] we want to find what rest for our souls
[31:26] it becomes rest
[31:28] humility becomes rest
[31:32] do you want rest do you want peace
[31:35] humble yourselves it's not about what
[31:39] you can do
[31:40] it's not about what you can achieve just
[31:43] about getting yourself out of the way
[31:45] and having ears to hear the voice of the
[31:48] spirit and be led
[31:49] by him you'll find rest
[31:53] for your souls 4 30
[31:57] for my yoke is easy
[32:01] and my burden is light
[32:05] okay the picture is not that there's not
[32:08] work to do
[32:10] a yoke means work you means effort a
[32:13] yoke means sweat
[32:15] right don't don't get it wrong by
[32:16] looking at easy
[32:18] about easy and a light burden it's
[32:21] simply saying
[32:22] i'm right next to you
[32:26] the author and finisher of your
[32:28] salvation is right next to you
[32:29] the bishop of your soul is right next to
[32:32] you
[32:33] pulling with you but you have to pull
[32:36] two
[32:36] yeah you you have effort too
[32:39] but the thing is when when your savior
[32:43] is next to you
[32:45] all things are possible amen and that
[32:48] is a place of rest because it's him
[32:52] working it's him moving you're just
[32:54] following
[32:56] you belong to him but it takes that
[32:58] humble heart
[33:00] to follow to hear and to take that yoke
[33:04] amen let's stand and pray
[33:09] heavenly father we thank you so much for
[33:11] your word i pray that you would take it
[33:13] make it alive and real to our hearts
[33:15] father
[33:16] humble ourselves under your hand help us
[33:20] let that not be just a ethereal word
[33:23] lord that's
[33:24] out there of humility but lord help i
[33:27] pray that
[33:28] there was flesh put to that there was
[33:31] light
[33:32] shed on what that word means and and
[33:33] what it looks like lord and
[33:35] just move in us lord move in in us
[33:38] through this day pour your spirit out
[33:41] upon us
[33:42] through the worship through the
[33:44] preaching of the word we
[33:45] we want more of you lord we commit
[33:48] ourselves to you in the name of jesus
[33:49] christ
[33:50] amen god bless you
