TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] [Music] [Music] morning everyone God bless you let's stand together we'll go ahead and pull up the PowerPoint turn in the scriptures to Proverbs 17 continuing with our thought on a word family this is part 12 Proverbs 17:6 children's children are the crown of old men and the glory of children are their fathers let's pray father we come before you Lord and we're so thankful for your word we pray Lord that you'd take it Lord from off the pages and off off of the word spoken over this Pulpit Lord and write it on the hearts of your people Lord we we know that it takes your quickening power and that we're helpless to accomplish this on our own Lord we can we can store up the food we can uh plant the seeds but only you can bring them to life and that's what our desire is Lord so we commit ourselves to you be glorified in our midst we ask in Jesus name amen amen so as we spoke about last time we're living in a a generation where seems that family and uh children uh lack uh the the True Value that God places on them and we live in such a consumer oriented world that the inconveniences that come from having children um are are too much and people decide that this is a this is a great inconvenience to them living their life all the while we increase in depression we increase in lack of satisfaction in life and we look in every direction and everyone's sad and upset and frustrated and we miss the reality that God designed us to be in families God designed us to be a part of a family God God designed us to face the difficulties that come with relationships and with different families joining to different families and these things are are good and positive and being tied down with children we should realize that this language is from the pits of hell it is not being tied down with children part of part of the calling that God has in your life and maybe the major calling that you have in your life is raising a family being a father being a grandfather being a mother being a grandmother and we look at this as a secondary thing and a side thing when it actually is the thing why do we look at it like that why did the devil plant this seed in the 19th and the 20th and now the 21st century now we're see seeing the seed become a fruit in in in the world and what is that fruit is that cultures certain cultures who have taken this message and internalized it are dying are going out of existence that's what Pro process we see in Western Europe and in America and Canada that the attitudes that are planted within the heart of man about family and about children are are now running their course and it is the destruction of society and the end of the western world as we know it and we're not here to try to rebuild the Western world that's not the point and purpose what we're here to do is make sure that our minds are in line with the scripture and that our hearts and our attitudes about families and about children line up with what the word says Brothers you want a crown you want lots of crowns amen have children and then teach your children that families are a blessing that big amilies are a blessing did you know young people did you know that you once you get married you don't have to follow what other people tell you to do you can listen to God yourself and have the attitude that God wants you to have you'll hear all kinds of comments why are you having so many kids why why are you doing this could we please shut up with that cuz are you speaking with the Devil Voice or God's voice when we speak we should speak with the Oracles of God if you're a Christian that should be your desire so we this un unwittingly we're planting the seeds of discontent and a dislike of what God Said is a blessing many many of us take our crowns and we cast them to the ground and we look at our self and selfishness self-centered this what are you saying take your crowns and cast them to the ground we don't see and understand the value and importance that God places on family because the crown of old men is their grandchildren they don't want to Crown they just want to have fun traveling and don't trouble me with kids don't trouble me with family it's just trouble that's because there's there's a broken heart and a broken mind that doesn't understand the value and the importance of that amen and on the other side is children are given the wrong Viewpoint and the wrong idea in our day and our society instead of them being told the glory of children are your fathers is the attitude that's implanted in society and in children is that parents are annoying parents are frustrating parents hold you back parents let me tell you what the God's word says the the biggest influence in children's life should not be their peers it's not supposed to be that's not God's design and when we order our lives and live our lives with that idea in mind we do a great disservice to our children the glory of children are their fathers we should we should have that attitude we should teach that attitude and if we don't have that attitude we need to ask the Lord to change our hearts even if our parents don't deserve it it says honor your father and mother that's your obedience to the Lord your parent you're you're you might have the worst parents in the world the biggest jerks of all time honor your father and mother that doesn't mean you don't have boundaries that doesn't mean you don't live in such a way that you you you are creating a circumstance that you are to be treated with respect and you have your your as as you get older and you create your own household you have your own decisions to make and yet above all that it's still a calling to in from your heart with sincerity honor your father and mother amen don't miss out on the crown and once once again I'll repeat this with any any kind of teaching like this is we don't know when the Rapture is going to take place we have been saying and I believe that it is any moment but we must plant the potatoes brother brandom said in the seventh seal don't be a fanatic live a Godly Christian Life and if I knew he was coming tomorrow and I had to plant potatoes today I would plant them today so don't get you know have the rap Rapture Ready mode mentality but live your life like there's Generations to come because we don't know we've been proven we've been proven time and time again to think we know and we don't so H have that desperation and understand he's coming at any moment but don't don't plan your life that way we're forbidden by the prophet to to do that Psalms 128 verse one blessed is everyone that fears the Lord that walketh in his ways amen for thou shalt eat the labor of thine hands you reap what you sow the the life that you live uh as a family we're reading through the Proverbs and I see more and more it's what we speak and it's the the diligence that we have that we put towards our work we will eat that fruit the fruit of our lips and the fruits of our attitude towards our work that's what we're going to eat happy shalt thou be and it shall be well with thee it doesn't mean life is always easy many are the afflictions of the righteous but if you consistently and constantly apply God's wisdom God's knowledge God's understanding to your life happy shalt thou be in the midst of the storm in midst of the trials and it shall be well with thee that's the direction that your life will take but if you continuously reject the wisdom of God reject sound biblical counsel and go against it it won't be well with you that will be the general trajectory of your life going forward it will be bad it will be hard it's going to be hard either way let it be a good trajectory following the wisdom of God thy wife so here's some of the blessings and some of the great Bounty thy wife shall be as a fruitful Vine by the sides of thine house thy children like Olive plants round about thy table I love that so your wife is going to be producing lots of fruit and that's a great blessing from the Lord can we say amen amen this is God's attitude and God's heart it doesn't say and thy wife shall accompany you on trips around the world so you're unencumbered by children that's what people think that's the attitude that's implanted thy children like Olive plants around thy table what a this this picture is the family gathered for a meal together and there's Harmony and there's love and th those children then turn and become fruitful this is God's blessing God loves this God wants our hearts to see that this is a huge part of his blessing upon us behold that thus shall the man be blessed that feareth the Lord so many people have an attitude that that isn't a blessing they don't want that they don't like that but God's blessing is according to his purpose and a family a children it's a blessing the Lord shall bless thee out of Zion and thou shalt see the good of Jerusalem all the days of thy life y Thou shalt see thy children's children and peace be upon Israel so again we read before in Psalm uh 127 uh and as arrows in the hands of a mighty man so are the children of the youth happy is the man that has his quiver full of them again God's heart and God's attitude towards children the more the marrier is another way that God is saying it and again it sounds strange this is the probably the I'm the weirdest preacher that y'all know and I'm okay with that because it's the word of God this I want to implant in all of you the understanding especially I wish someone preached this to me when I was Ethan's age have children when you're young that's what the Bible is saying be blessed in the children don't say I'm going to travel and have all kinds of experiences and enjoy it while I can is that scriptural advice is that God's attitude towards it have children when you're young fill your quiver full of them and realize that they're arrows and they're Olive plants and a huge part of your personal growth as a Christian will be in parenting shared suffering with your with your wife will draw you together closer than anything any trip or travel or anything that you will possibly do and we laugh and we joke about it but there's a reality behind that that when we share our lives together when we suffer through the tribulations and the trials of a Christian in this life our hearts are bound together we can even testify that of that those who run Youth Camp every year is one minute you're ready to throttle each other but then you see at the end the Lord has drawn your hearts closer together and there's a respect and honor and reverence that you have for one another that couldn't be created just by knowing each other from a distance and so very interesting to see is your children are like Olive plants around my table even that has been uh pushed away and and changed in our hour everybody gets their food and goes off to their corner of the house and gets on their favorite device to watch whatever they enjoy watching that's the world that we're living in it used to be that family gathered together around the table for breakfast and gathered around the table again for dinner there was time of prayer a time of reading the scripture and it was a sacred moment and now we get so busy that our lives are ordered entirely and completely different and it's not a good thing I I would encourage everyone if you can to order your life in such a way where you have a meal as a family amen sometimes it's difficult sometimes it's impossible but it should be a regular thing and not a rare thing that you're gathered together and even even the picture of not only this is building not only your family now but this is building what is normal for the Next Generation this is teaching you you you might teach them the right thing but model the right thing and on on so many levels this Olive these Olive plants around your table um this is a this is a place of teaching this is a place of establishing this is a place of strengthening this is a place where you don't lose the hearts of your kids don't use it as a time to beat them over the head talk and listen talk and listen listen might they might need to be beat over the head but try to make the the dinner time a special time of connecting hearts together because that's really that's where real teaching comes you can it's we you want to every day gather as a family sing and pray and read the scripture and talk about the scripture with your family but it's in the times where you're really connecting with each other's hearts around the dinner table that's where the teaching can become so effective because you start to learn what the struggles are and learn what all their friends are telling them and learn learn learn what you need to be praying about and that's critical critical don't be so busy that meal and tired that your meals are just of another form of entertainment but begin even if you can't didn't before begin now to to make a family tradition of gathering around the table as a family lift it up as important starts with Dad lifting it up as important Deuteronomy chapter six as we sort of begin to turn the corner and look at the importance of teaching within the Realms of the family Deuteronomy 6 61 isn't this amazing this is dealing with I want to read this whole thing whole section because this is dealing with the greatest commandment the top two Commandments right and this is where the top two Commandments are supposed to be transmitted now these are the Commandments the statutes and the judgments with the Lord which the Lord your God commanded to teach you that you might do them in the land whether you go to possess it that thou mightest fear the lord thy God to keep all his statutes and his Commandments which I command thee thou and thy son and thy son's son all the days of thy life and that thy days may be prolonged hear therefore oh Israel and observe to do it that it may be well with thee and that ye may increase mightily as the Lord God of thy fathers has promised thee in the land that floweth with milk and honey here o Israel the Lord our God is one Lord and thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thine heart and with all thy soul and with all thy might and these words which I command thee this day shall be in thine heart and thou shalt teach and thou shalt teach them diligently un unto thy children amen notice that that God doesn't say thou shalt go to the synagogue and be taught them by the priest of course the priest should teach teach that that's his duty but the first line of transmission of the truth is not there where is the first first line of transmission of Truth in the home in the family amen teach your children diligently so that this means that it's not a halfhazard thing that there's a plan there's a purpose there's a vision and it's constant and consistent teaching your children it's not just teach them to your children but he adds the word diligently put your effort put your strength put your whole heart into teaching these Commandments to your children when should we do it and you shall talk the talk of them when thou sest in thine house so when you're sitting with your family in your house talk about the word of God Amen teach the word of God when else and when thou wst by the way when you're traveling when you're on a trip when you're going from place to place talk about it teach the word to your children when else should we do it when you go to bed when you lie down and and in the morning when you rise up so there's a diligence that needs to be done this is the the establishment of what brother brandham would has called and many have called the family altar this this really shouldn't be something that we have to teach everybody it should be second nature I didn't grow up with this myself I didn't grow up in the message and I didn't grow up with this I knew nothing about it and I was never taught anything about it to be honest with you until I started having my own family and started searching the word for myself and began to look I began to look at even church history and I began to look at what brother brandham said and I thought my goodness I should have been doing this with my wife the moment we got married why wasn't I praying and reading the scriptures with my wife every night before bed well nothing can be helped about the past but now and the future can be helped and this is critical this this should be established in every home it shouldn't be just read quickly read the Bible sing a couple songs quickly pray but there should be time dedicated to it take the word read through the scriptures and teach your family amen don't just read the scriptures but comment on it you might not be skilled at it but if you do it three 365 days a year 7 days a week 24 years you'll be good at it by the end I promise but but do that read the scripture teach them the word don't just do it when it's convenient make it a priority every home should have that established if you can do it in the morning wonderful if you can't do it in the morning because dad leaves for work early mom do it with the children do it at do it do that at night have a time it's just a dichotomy of a church service you sing a song you read a scripture or a devotional you comment about it you sing more you take prayer requests you pray you commit yourself to the Lord and you go to bed that's what a family altar is that's what family worship is God let it be established in every home at bethl Tabernacle young men starting starting out establish this Worship in your home before there's children you don't need to wait until there's children this should be established and kids if you're listening and your family's not doing it nag your parents there's nothing wrong with nagging them about the right things but this is critical and and this is what God has called us to men is to have this established in our home it doesn't matter if we have kids or not doesn't matter if they're all gone and they have their families of their own it should still be established in the home it should never stop it should never cease am it should be it should be part of a our regular lifestyle Genesis 18 part of the reason that God worked with Abraham he says and the Lord said shall I hide from Abraham that thing which I do seeing that Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation and all the nations of the Earth shall be blessed in him for I know him that he will command his children and his household after him and they shall keep the way of the Lord to do justice and judgment that the Lord may bring upon Abraham that which he has spoken of him it was Abraham's duty to teach his family the word of God it wasn't someone else's duty this is each father's and husband's duty is to establish the word of God in his family and the pre this ministry this preaching of the word that happens at the pulpit really the purpose is to equip men to lead their households amen so that they can have their family established in the word it's not enough it'll do you good it'll do a great world of good and God will use it mightily but it'll it it's a massive missing piece if fathers aren't in their home leading their families in worship and teaching them I mean you see this that it wasn't that Abraham was just going to have them remember the Lord's Prayer and the the top two Commandments it was that he was he will keep them he'll command them he'll keep them in the way and then he'll teach them and model for them Justice and judgment right so it wasn't just a matter of oh we learn the Lord's Prayer and we know the Ten Commandments sure that's we must know that we should be teaching that to our little children but it's more than that it's to keep them in the way it's not just a one-time thing it's not just that we go to church every day but it's they are established in the word of God because Dad has established them in the word of God Amen and and to me it's it's it's it's my prayer and it's my desire that if if nothing else out of this out of this um study on a word family that fathers would realize start this now I I myself have been dilatory many times in this but with God's grace we'll be consistent am and we not quit and we not give up the righteous falls seven times but he rises be but the wicked stumbles and there's no there's no there's no answer to it he just stumbles the righteous stumbles also but he rises up every times he stumbles my son hear the instruction of thy father and forsake not the law of thy mother for they shall be an ornament of Grace unto thy head and chains about thy neck and ye fathers provoke not your children to wrath but bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the lord we have to realize and see that the home is the place where the word is to be taught not just the church the church must be a place for proclamation of the word every week but the home is supposed to be a place of teaching and instruction how many can say I won't I don't want to forsake the instruction of my father and I don't want to forsake the law of my mother let it be that my home would be established in such a way that my children would go forward go forth and see this and remember it and say my parents taught me my parents established me in the word many times it brings confusion in young people's lives because there's not a consistency of teaching at church and at home there's two different things going on and it becomes a confusion let it not be so may there be a consistency of the word going forth not just on Wednesday and Sunday but the word going forth in every home and into every heart and that it wouldn't be just a bunch of rules but it would be truly the life-changing power of God coming forth because there's a true relationship established not only between parents and children but parents are doing just what the preacher is supposed to do and getting those children in touch with God himself because you can plant all the seeds you want but it takes the quickening power of the Holy Ghost to bring them to life let there not be a day that we're not praying for our children that we're planting seeds and praying that the Holy Spirit quickens those seeds amen
