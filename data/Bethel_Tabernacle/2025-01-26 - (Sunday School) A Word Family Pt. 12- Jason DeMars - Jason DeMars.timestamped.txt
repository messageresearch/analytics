[5:19] morning everyone God bless you let's
[5:22] stand
[5:26] together we'll go ahead and pull up the
[5:28] PowerPoint turn in the scriptures to
[5:32] Proverbs
[5:34] 17 continuing with our thought on a word
[5:38] family this is part
[5:47] 12 Proverbs 17:6 children's children are
[5:51] the crown of old men and the glory of
[5:55] children are their fathers let's pray
[5:59] father we come before you Lord and we're
[6:01] so thankful for your word we pray Lord
[6:03] that you'd take it Lord from off the
[6:05] pages and off off of the word spoken
[6:09] over this Pulpit Lord and write it on
[6:11] the hearts of your people Lord we we
[6:13] know that it takes your quickening power
[6:15] and that we're helpless to accomplish
[6:18] this on our own Lord we can we can store
[6:21] up the food we can uh plant the seeds
[6:24] but only you can bring them to life and
[6:26] that's what our desire is Lord so we
[6:28] commit ourselves to you be glorified in
[6:30] our midst we ask in Jesus name
[6:34] amen amen
[6:37] so as we spoke about last time we're
[6:41] living in a a generation where seems
[6:45] that family and uh children uh lack uh
[6:51] the the True Value that God places on
[6:54] them and we live in such a consumer
[6:58] oriented
[7:00] world that the inconveniences that come
[7:04] from having
[7:05] children um are are too much and people
[7:12] decide that this is a this is a great
[7:16] inconvenience to them living their
[7:18] life all the while we increase in
[7:21] depression we increase in lack of
[7:23] satisfaction in life and we look in
[7:26] every direction and everyone's sad and
[7:29] upset and frustrated and we miss the
[7:32] reality that God designed us to
[7:34] be in
[7:36] families God designed us to be a part of
[7:39] a family God God designed us to face the
[7:44] difficulties that come with
[7:46] relationships and with different
[7:48] families joining to different families
[7:50] and these things are are good and
[7:53] positive and being tied down with
[7:56] children we should realize that this
[7:59] language is from the pits of hell it is
[8:02] not being tied down with children part
[8:05] of part of the calling that God has in
[8:07] your life and maybe the major calling
[8:11] that you have in your life is raising a
[8:14] family being a father being a
[8:16] grandfather being a mother being a
[8:18] grandmother and we look at this as a
[8:21] secondary thing and a side thing when it
[8:24] actually is the
[8:27] thing why do we look at it like that why
[8:30] did the devil plant this seed in the
[8:34] 19th and the 20th and now the 21st
[8:39] century now we're see seeing the seed
[8:42] become a
[8:44] fruit in in in the world and what is
[8:48] that fruit is that cultures certain
[8:51] cultures who have taken this message and
[8:53] internalized it are dying are going out
[8:57] of existence that's what Pro process we
[8:59] see in Western Europe and in America and
[9:04] Canada that the attitudes that are
[9:06] planted within the heart of man about
[9:10] family and about children are are now
[9:14] running their course and it is the
[9:17] destruction of society and the end of
[9:20] the western world as we know it and
[9:24] we're not here to try to rebuild the
[9:26] Western
[9:28] world that's not the point and purpose
[9:30] what we're here to do is make sure that
[9:33] our minds are in line with the scripture
[9:37] and that our hearts and our attitudes
[9:39] about families and about children line
[9:42] up with what the word
[9:44] says Brothers you want a
[9:47] crown you want lots of crowns amen have
[9:51] children and then teach your children
[9:54] that families are a
[9:57] blessing that big amilies are a blessing
[10:01] did you know young people did you know
[10:03] that you once you get
[10:05] married you don't have to follow what
[10:08] other people tell you to
[10:11] do you can listen to God yourself and
[10:14] have the attitude that God wants you to
[10:16] have you'll hear all kinds of comments
[10:19] why are you having so many kids why why
[10:21] are you doing this could we please shut
[10:23] up with
[10:26] that cuz are you speaking with the Devil
[10:29] Voice or God's
[10:30] voice when we speak we should speak with
[10:33] the Oracles of God if you're a Christian
[10:35] that should be your desire so we this un
[10:38] unwittingly we're planting the seeds of
[10:42] discontent and a dislike of what God
[10:45] Said is a
[10:48] blessing many many of us take our crowns
[10:53] and we cast them to the ground and we
[10:55] look at our self and selfishness
[10:58] self-centered this what are you saying
[11:00] take your crowns and cast them to the
[11:02] ground we don't see and understand the
[11:05] value and importance that God places on
[11:09] family because the crown of old men is
[11:12] their
[11:14] grandchildren they don't want to Crown
[11:16] they just want to have fun traveling and
[11:18] don't trouble me with kids don't trouble
[11:20] me with family it's just trouble that's
[11:23] because there's there's a broken heart
[11:26] and a broken mind that doesn't
[11:28] understand
[11:30] the value and the importance of
[11:33] that amen and on the other side
[11:37] is children are given the wrong
[11:40] Viewpoint and the wrong idea in our day
[11:43] and our society instead of them being
[11:46] told the glory of children are your
[11:48] fathers is the attitude that's
[11:51] implanted in society and in children is
[11:55] that parents are annoying parents are
[11:57] frustrating parents hold you back
[12:00] parents let me tell you what the God's
[12:02] word says the the biggest influence in
[12:05] children's life should not be their
[12:07] peers it's not supposed to be that's not
[12:10] God's design and when we order our lives
[12:14] and live our lives with that idea in
[12:16] mind we do a great disservice to our
[12:21] children the glory of children are their
[12:26] fathers we should we should have that
[12:28] attitude we should teach that attitude
[12:31] and if we don't have that
[12:32] attitude we need to ask the Lord to
[12:35] change our
[12:36] hearts even if our parents don't deserve
[12:39] it it says honor your father and mother
[12:42] that's your obedience to the Lord your
[12:45] parent you're you're you might have the
[12:46] worst parents in the world the biggest
[12:48] jerks of all time honor your father and
[12:52] mother that doesn't mean you don't have
[12:53] boundaries that doesn't mean you don't
[12:55] live in such a way that
[12:57] you you you are creating a circumstance
[13:01] that you are to be treated with respect
[13:04] and you have your your as as you get
[13:07] older and you create your own household
[13:08] you have your own decisions to make and
[13:10] yet above all that it's still a calling
[13:13] to in from your heart with sincerity
[13:16] honor your father and mother
[13:19] amen don't miss out on the crown and
[13:23] once once again I'll repeat this with
[13:25] any any kind of teaching like this is we
[13:28] don't know when the Rapture is going to
[13:30] take place we have been saying and I
[13:32] believe that it is any moment but we
[13:36] must plant the potatoes brother brandom
[13:39] said in the seventh seal don't be a
[13:41] fanatic live a Godly Christian Life and
[13:44] if I knew he was coming tomorrow and I
[13:46] had to plant potatoes today I would
[13:48] plant them
[13:49] today so don't get you know have the rap
[13:53] Rapture Ready mode mentality but live
[13:56] your life like there's Generations to
[13:59] come because we don't
[14:03] know we've been proven we've been proven
[14:06] time and time again to think we know and
[14:09] we
[14:11] don't so H have that desperation and
[14:15] understand he's coming at any
[14:16] moment but don't don't plan your life
[14:20] that way we're forbidden by the prophet
[14:23] to to do
[14:24] that Psalms
[14:26] 128 verse one
[14:30] blessed is everyone that fears the Lord
[14:33] that walketh in his
[14:36] ways amen for thou shalt eat the labor
[14:40] of thine hands you reap what you
[14:44] sow the the life that you live uh as a
[14:47] family we're reading through the
[14:48] Proverbs and I see more and more it's
[14:51] what we speak and it's the the diligence
[14:54] that we have that we put towards our
[14:56] work we will eat that fruit
[15:00] the fruit of our lips and the fruits of
[15:03] our attitude towards our
[15:05] work that's what we're going to
[15:08] eat happy shalt thou be and it shall be
[15:12] well with thee it doesn't mean life is
[15:14] always easy many are the afflictions of
[15:16] the righteous but if you consistently
[15:19] and constantly apply God's wisdom God's
[15:22] knowledge God's understanding to your
[15:25] life happy shalt thou be in the midst of
[15:28] the storm in midst of the trials and it
[15:32] shall be well with thee that's the
[15:34] direction that your life will take but
[15:37] if you continuously reject the wisdom of
[15:40] God reject sound biblical counsel and go
[15:44] against it it won't be well with you
[15:47] that will be the general trajectory of
[15:49] your life going forward it will be bad
[15:53] it will be hard it's going to be hard
[15:54] either way let it be a good trajectory
[15:58] following the wisdom of
[16:01] God thy wife so here's some of the
[16:04] blessings and some of the great Bounty
[16:07] thy wife shall be as a fruitful Vine by
[16:10] the sides of thine house thy children
[16:12] like Olive plants round about thy
[16:17] table I love that so your wife is going
[16:21] to be producing lots of
[16:23] fruit and that's a great blessing from
[16:26] the Lord can we say amen amen this is
[16:29] God's attitude and God's
[16:31] heart it doesn't say and thy wife shall
[16:34] accompany you on trips around the world
[16:36] so you're unencumbered by
[16:40] children that's what people think that's
[16:43] the attitude that's
[16:46] implanted thy children like Olive plants
[16:49] around thy table what a this this
[16:52] picture is the family gathered for a
[16:54] meal together and there's Harmony and
[16:59] there's love and th those children then
[17:03] turn and become
[17:05] fruitful this is God's blessing God
[17:07] loves this God wants our hearts to see
[17:11] that this is a huge part of his blessing
[17:14] upon
[17:16] us behold that thus shall the man be
[17:20] blessed that feareth the Lord so many
[17:24] people have an attitude that that isn't
[17:26] a blessing they don't want that they
[17:28] don't like that
[17:29] but God's
[17:32] blessing is according to his purpose and
[17:35] a family a children it's a
[17:39] blessing the Lord shall bless thee out
[17:42] of Zion and thou shalt see the good of
[17:45] Jerusalem all the days of thy life y
[17:49] Thou shalt see thy children's children
[17:52] and peace be upon
[17:55] Israel so again
[18:01] we read before in Psalm uh
[18:06] 127 uh and as arrows in the hands of a
[18:09] mighty man so are the children of the
[18:11] youth happy is the man that has his
[18:14] quiver full of them again God's heart
[18:18] and God's attitude towards
[18:22] children the more the marrier is another
[18:24] way that God is saying it and again it
[18:28] sounds strange this is the probably the
[18:30] I'm the weirdest preacher that y'all
[18:32] know and I'm okay with that because it's
[18:34] the word of
[18:36] God this I want to
[18:39] implant in all of you the understanding
[18:42] especially I wish someone preached this
[18:44] to me when I was Ethan's
[18:51] age have children when you're young
[18:54] that's what the Bible is saying be
[18:56] blessed in the children don't say I'm
[18:58] going to travel and have all kinds of
[19:00] experiences and enjoy it while I
[19:03] can is that scriptural
[19:06] advice is that God's attitude towards it
[19:10] have children when you're young fill
[19:12] your quiver full of them and realize
[19:14] that they're arrows and they're Olive
[19:18] plants and a huge part of your personal
[19:22] growth as a Christian will be in
[19:25] parenting
[19:30] shared suffering with your with your
[19:32] wife will draw you together closer than
[19:36] anything any trip or travel or anything
[19:40] that you will possibly
[19:42] do and we laugh and we joke about it but
[19:46] there's a reality behind that that when
[19:49] we share our lives together when we
[19:51] suffer through the tribulations and the
[19:53] trials of a Christian in this life our
[19:57] hearts are bound together we can even
[20:01] testify that of that those who run Youth
[20:04] Camp every year
[20:06] is one minute you're ready to throttle
[20:09] each other but then you see at the end
[20:11] the Lord has drawn your hearts closer
[20:13] together and there's a respect and honor
[20:16] and reverence that you have for one
[20:17] another that couldn't be created just by
[20:19] knowing each other from a
[20:23] distance and so very interesting to see
[20:27] is your children
[20:29] are like Olive plants around my
[20:35] table even that has
[20:38] been uh pushed away and and changed in
[20:42] our hour everybody gets their food and
[20:44] goes off to their corner of the house
[20:45] and gets on their favorite device to
[20:48] watch whatever they enjoy watching
[20:51] that's the world that we're living in it
[20:53] used to be that family gathered together
[20:56] around the table for breakfast and
[20:59] gathered around the table again for
[21:01] dinner there was time of prayer a time
[21:04] of reading the scripture and it was a
[21:07] sacred moment and now we get so busy
[21:11] that our lives are ordered entirely and
[21:14] completely different and it's not a good
[21:18] thing I I would encourage everyone if
[21:21] you can to order your life in such a way
[21:24] where you have a meal as a family amen
[21:29] sometimes it's difficult sometimes it's
[21:30] impossible but it should be a regular
[21:33] thing and not a rare thing that you're
[21:35] gathered together and even even the
[21:38] picture of not only this is building not
[21:43] only your family now but this is
[21:46] building what is normal for the Next
[21:49] Generation this is teaching you you you
[21:53] might teach them the right thing but
[21:55] model the right thing
[22:01] and on on so many levels
[22:05] this Olive these Olive plants around
[22:08] your
[22:09] table um this is a this is a place of
[22:13] teaching this is a place of establishing
[22:17] this is a place of strengthening this is
[22:19] a place where you don't lose the hearts
[22:21] of your
[22:23] kids don't use it as a time to beat them
[22:25] over the head talk and listen talk and
[22:28] listen
[22:29] listen might they might need to be beat
[22:31] over the head
[22:34] but try to make the the dinner time a
[22:37] special time of connecting hearts
[22:41] together because that's really that's
[22:43] where real teaching comes you can it's
[22:46] we you want to every day gather as a
[22:49] family sing and pray and read the
[22:52] scripture and talk about the scripture
[22:53] with your family but it's in the times
[22:56] where you're really connecting with each
[22:57] other's hearts around the dinner
[23:00] table that's where the teaching can
[23:02] become so effective because you start to
[23:04] learn what the struggles are and learn
[23:06] what all their friends are telling them
[23:09] and learn learn learn what you need to
[23:12] be praying about and that's critical
[23:15] critical don't be so busy that meal and
[23:19] tired that your meals are just of
[23:21] another form of entertainment
[23:23] but begin even if you can't didn't
[23:27] before begin now to to make a family
[23:30] tradition of gathering around the table
[23:33] as a family lift it up as
[23:35] important starts with Dad lifting it up
[23:38] as
[23:41] important
[23:43] Deuteronomy chapter
[23:45] six as we sort of begin to turn the
[23:48] corner and look
[23:50] at the importance
[23:53] of teaching within the Realms of the
[23:56] family Deuteronomy 6 61 isn't this
[23:59] amazing this is dealing
[24:02] with I want to read this whole thing
[24:04] whole section because this is dealing
[24:07] with the greatest commandment the top
[24:10] two
[24:11] Commandments right and this is where the
[24:15] top two Commandments are supposed to be
[24:19] transmitted now these are the
[24:21] Commandments the statutes and the
[24:23] judgments with the Lord which the Lord
[24:25] your God commanded to teach you that you
[24:28] might do them in the land whether you go
[24:31] to possess
[24:32] it that thou mightest fear the lord thy
[24:35] God to keep all his statutes and his
[24:37] Commandments which I command thee thou
[24:39] and thy son and thy son's son all the
[24:42] days of thy life and that thy days may
[24:44] be
[24:45] prolonged hear therefore oh Israel and
[24:48] observe to do it that it may be well
[24:50] with thee and that ye may increase
[24:52] mightily as the Lord God of thy fathers
[24:54] has promised thee in the land that
[24:57] floweth with milk and
[24:59] honey here o Israel the Lord our God is
[25:03] one Lord and thou shalt love the Lord
[25:06] thy God with all thine heart and with
[25:09] all thy soul and with all thy
[25:11] might and these words which I command
[25:14] thee this day shall be in thine
[25:17] heart and thou shalt teach and thou
[25:20] shalt teach them diligently un unto thy
[25:25] children amen notice that that God
[25:28] doesn't say thou shalt go to the
[25:31] synagogue and be taught them by the
[25:34] priest of course the priest should teach
[25:37] teach that that's his duty but the first
[25:40] line of
[25:41] transmission of the truth is not
[25:44] there where is the first first line of
[25:47] transmission of Truth in the home in the
[25:52] family amen teach your children
[25:56] diligently
[25:58] so that this means that it's not a
[26:01] halfhazard thing that there's a plan
[26:03] there's a purpose there's a vision and
[26:06] it's constant and consistent teaching
[26:10] your children it's not just teach them
[26:12] to your children but he adds the word
[26:14] diligently put your effort put your
[26:16] strength put your whole heart into
[26:20] teaching these Commandments to your
[26:23] children when should we do it and you
[26:26] shall talk the talk of them when thou
[26:29] sest in thine house so when you're
[26:31] sitting with your family in your house
[26:35] talk about the word of God Amen teach
[26:37] the word of God when else and when thou
[26:41] wst by the way when you're traveling
[26:44] when you're on a trip when you're going
[26:46] from place to place talk about it teach
[26:50] the word to your children when else
[26:53] should we do it when you go to bed when
[26:56] you lie down and and in the morning when
[26:59] you rise up so there's a diligence that
[27:03] needs to be done this is the the
[27:07] establishment of what brother brandham
[27:09] would has called and many have called
[27:11] the family
[27:14] altar this this really shouldn't be
[27:18] something that we have to teach
[27:20] everybody it should be second nature I
[27:23] didn't grow up with this myself I didn't
[27:25] grow up in the message and I didn't grow
[27:27] up with this I knew nothing about it and
[27:29] I was never taught anything about it to
[27:31] be honest with you until I started
[27:33] having my own family and started
[27:34] searching the word for myself and began
[27:38] to look I began to look at even church
[27:40] history and I began to look at what
[27:42] brother brandham said and I thought my
[27:44] goodness I should have been doing this
[27:46] with my wife the moment we got
[27:48] married why wasn't I praying and reading
[27:51] the scriptures with my wife every night
[27:53] before
[27:55] bed well nothing can be helped about the
[27:58] past but now and the future can be
[28:02] helped and this is critical this this
[28:05] should be established in every home it
[28:09] shouldn't be just read quickly read the
[28:11] Bible sing a couple songs quickly pray
[28:14] but there should be time dedicated to it
[28:16] take the word read through the
[28:19] scriptures and teach your family amen
[28:22] don't just read the scriptures but
[28:24] comment on it you might not be skilled
[28:27] at it but if you do it three 365 days a
[28:29] year 7 days a week 24 years you'll be
[28:32] good at it by the end I
[28:36] promise but but do
[28:41] that read the scripture teach them the
[28:45] word don't just do it when it's
[28:47] convenient make it a priority every home
[28:51] should have that
[28:52] established if you can do it in the
[28:54] morning wonderful if you can't do it in
[28:56] the morning because dad leaves for work
[28:58] early mom do
[29:00] it with the
[29:03] children do it at do it do that at
[29:06] night have a time it's just a dichotomy
[29:10] of a church
[29:11] service you sing a song you read a
[29:15] scripture or a devotional you comment
[29:18] about it you sing more you take prayer
[29:21] requests you pray you commit yourself to
[29:25] the Lord and you go to bed that's what a
[29:28] family altar is that's what family
[29:29] worship is God let it be established in
[29:32] every home at bethl
[29:35] Tabernacle young men starting starting
[29:38] out establish this Worship in your home
[29:42] before there's
[29:44] children you don't need to wait until
[29:46] there's children this should be
[29:48] established
[29:50] and kids if you're listening and your
[29:52] family's not doing it nag your parents
[29:58] there's nothing wrong with nagging them
[30:00] about the right
[30:02] things but this is
[30:05] critical and and this is what God has
[30:07] called us to men is to have this
[30:11] established in our home it doesn't
[30:13] matter if we have kids or not doesn't
[30:15] matter if they're all gone and they have
[30:18] their families of their own it should
[30:19] still be established in the home it
[30:23] should never stop it should never cease
[30:25] am it should be it should be part of a
[30:28] our
[30:29] regular
[30:34] lifestyle Genesis 18 part of the
[30:37] reason
[30:39] that God worked with
[30:42] Abraham he says and the Lord said shall
[30:44] I hide from Abraham that thing which I
[30:47] do seeing that Abraham shall surely
[30:50] become a great and mighty nation and all
[30:52] the nations of the Earth shall be
[30:54] blessed in
[30:55] him for I know him that he will command
[30:59] his children and his household after him
[31:02] and they shall keep the way of the Lord
[31:04] to do justice and judgment that the Lord
[31:07] may bring upon Abraham that which he has
[31:10] spoken of him it was Abraham's duty to
[31:14] teach his family the word of
[31:17] God it wasn't someone else's
[31:20] duty this is each father's and husband's
[31:24] duty is to establish the word of God in
[31:27] his family and the pre this ministry
[31:30] this preaching of the word that happens
[31:32] at the pulpit really the purpose is to
[31:36] equip men to lead their households amen
[31:40] so that they can have their family
[31:43] established in the word it's not enough
[31:46] it'll do you good it'll do a great world
[31:48] of good and God will use it mightily but
[31:51] it'll it it's a massive missing piece if
[31:54] fathers aren't in their home leading
[31:56] their families in worship and teaching
[32:00] them I mean you see this that it wasn't
[32:04] that Abraham was just going to have them
[32:05] remember the Lord's Prayer
[32:09] and the the top two Commandments it was
[32:12] that he was he will keep them he'll
[32:15] command them he'll keep them in the way
[32:19] and then he'll teach them and model for
[32:21] them Justice and
[32:24] judgment right so it wasn't just a
[32:26] matter of oh we learn the Lord's Prayer
[32:29] and we know the Ten Commandments sure
[32:32] that's we must know that we should be
[32:35] teaching that to our little
[32:37] children but it's more than that it's to
[32:40] keep them in the way it's not just a
[32:41] one-time thing it's not just that we go
[32:44] to church every day but it's they are
[32:47] established in the word of God because
[32:50] Dad has established them in the word of
[32:53] God Amen and and to me it's it's it's
[32:57] it's my prayer and it's my desire that
[33:00] if if nothing else out of this out of
[33:03] this um study on a word family that
[33:06] fathers would realize start this now I I
[33:11] myself have been dilatory many times in
[33:14] this but with God's grace we'll be
[33:17] consistent am and we not quit and we not
[33:20] give
[33:21] up the righteous falls seven times but
[33:25] he
[33:26] rises be but the wicked
[33:30] stumbles and there's no there's no
[33:32] there's no answer to it he just
[33:35] stumbles the righteous stumbles also but
[33:37] he rises up every times he
[33:42] stumbles my son hear the instruction of
[33:46] thy father and forsake not the law of
[33:49] thy mother for they shall be an ornament
[33:52] of Grace unto thy head and
[33:54] chains about thy neck
[33:58] and ye fathers provoke not your children
[34:00] to wrath but bring them up in the
[34:03] nurture and
[34:05] admonition of the lord we have to
[34:08] realize and
[34:10] see that the home is the place where the
[34:13] word is to be taught not just the church
[34:16] the church must be a place for
[34:18] proclamation of the word every week but
[34:21] the home is supposed to be a place of
[34:25] teaching and instruction
[34:28] how many can say I won't I don't want to
[34:30] forsake the instruction of my father and
[34:33] I don't want to forsake the law of my
[34:35] mother let it be that my home would be
[34:38] established in such a way that my
[34:41] children would go forward go forth and
[34:44] see this and remember it and say my
[34:46] parents taught me my parents established
[34:49] me in the word many times it brings
[34:53] confusion in young people's lives
[34:55] because there's not a consistency of
[34:58] teaching at church and at home there's
[35:01] two different things going on and it
[35:03] becomes a confusion let it not be
[35:06] so may there be a consistency of the
[35:09] word going forth not just on Wednesday
[35:12] and Sunday but the word going forth in
[35:15] every
[35:16] home and into every heart and that it
[35:19] wouldn't be just a bunch of rules but it
[35:21] would be
[35:22] truly the life-changing power of God
[35:26] coming forth because there's a true
[35:28] relationship established not only
[35:31] between parents and children but parents
[35:34] are doing just what the preacher is
[35:36] supposed to do and getting those
[35:38] children in touch with God
[35:40] himself because you can plant all the
[35:42] seeds you want but it takes the
[35:44] quickening power of the Holy Ghost to
[35:46] bring them to life let there not be a
[35:49] day that we're not praying for our
[35:50] children that we're planting seeds and
[35:53] praying that the Holy Spirit quickens
[35:55] those seeds amen
