[35:49] can't seem to see the end of it amen so
[35:52] we're just going to keep on going amen
[35:55] I've um I've got got my quotes on the
[35:58] PowerPoint today to help me stay calm
[36:01] and collected amen praise the Lord amen
[36:05] it helps me of course my daughter-in-law
[36:06] Katie told me I was saying last week
[36:08] about the service I said yeah I had my
[36:10] Powerpoints and that kind of kept me you
[36:12] know from not blowing up she got she
[36:14] said yeah but then you read your your
[36:17] quote and you start
[36:18] freestyling I said okay never heard it
[36:21] called that but I'll take it amen praise
[36:25] the Lord so if we start freestyle and
[36:27] you'll know what's
[36:29] up amen tickled me Hebrews chapter
[36:35] 1 verse
[36:38] one God who at sundry times and in
[36:41] diverse manners that's times in the past
[36:44] times in
[36:45] history in diverse manners various ways
[36:49] spake in time pass unto the fathers by
[36:54] the prophets now I want you to really
[36:57] realize he's not saying the prophets
[37:00] spoke he's saying God spoke through the
[37:04] prophets all right that's a massive
[37:07] difference so now he says that was in
[37:09] the past all right now let's bring It
[37:11] Forward that was all prior to Calvary
[37:14] now let's go after Calvary the same God
[37:18] hath in these last days spoken unto us
[37:22] by his son whom he hath appointed heir
[37:27] of All Things by whom also he made the
[37:31] world all right let's pray father we are
[37:36] remembering at this time our dear sister
[37:39] Linda and Lord the enemy father demons
[37:42] are tormentors and so we're praying for
[37:45] her Deliverance right now Lord we we see
[37:48] the the tyranny of the enemy and we pray
[37:51] against him Lord I Lift prayers with
[37:53] this audience today we pray against
[37:56] these plans of Lucifer Lord and I I
[37:59] issue this prayer and I ask that the
[38:01] Holy Spirit Lord rebuke the enemy he is
[38:04] a trespasser and that he turn loose
[38:07] God's Property that she may be well and
[38:10] painfree we commit it to you master in
[38:13] Jesus name now Lord take the word break
[38:16] it to us let it be the bread of life we
[38:19] commit our s into your hands just now
[38:22] and Lord I'm trying to take no thought
[38:25] of my own
[38:27] and I just want to rely on you and trust
[38:30] in you completely in Jesus name amen God
[38:33] bless you you can be
[38:45] seated so I I
[38:49] sincerely covet your prayers today and
[38:53] this thought has become so expansive as
[38:56] I studied it and it's a lot of what I
[39:00] want to say is quite
[39:05] um fresh to me not as a not as a New
[39:09] Concept per se but just in Greater
[39:12] levels of it can I say it that way
[39:14] deeper grasping
[39:18] of say in this hour how many believe
[39:22] we're right near the end man right near
[39:24] the Finish Line friends it's in it's
[39:27] impossible as a Bible believing uh
[39:30] Christian to believe that the world
[39:33] could have much more time on its on its
[39:36] calendar when that day is only God knows
[39:40] Jesus said that's something the father
[39:42] has in his own under his own care his
[39:44] own his own knowledge his own will uh
[39:47] he's bringing it all to pass but just
[39:49] know this that God does see a day God
[39:52] knows when that day is and we are simply
[39:55] told what what to look for and when we
[39:58] see certain things we will know that
[40:01] that that that event is very very near
[40:05] and I would say that it is so imminent
[40:08] today certainly it's more clear wouldn't
[40:10] be saying anything new or strange if I
[40:13] said that it's closer today than it's
[40:15] ever been That's goes almost without
[40:18] saying but I'm here to tell you friends
[40:20] when I look at prophecy and I see and
[40:23] and we looked at it in the 70s and we
[40:25] looked at it in the 80s 9 and te and
[40:27] 2000s and the teens and we're looking at
[40:29] it today I I can look I can actually
[40:32] look back with that hindsight and go my
[40:36] what we thought was so much of a
[40:38] prophecy then it today it's all that's
[40:41] almost not comparable you are right at
[40:44] the door you see there's no question in
[40:48] your mind there shouldn't be any
[40:49] question that the that Christ is not
[40:53] going to wait indefinitely to go back
[40:56] for his people Israel and he's going
[40:59] back to receive the elected Hebrews uh
[41:02] who are the true children of Abraham
[41:07] 144,000 elected Jews the ministry of
[41:09] Moses and Elijah if those if those are
[41:13] men Anointed with the ministry of Moses
[41:17] and Elijah which I lean toward and
[41:19] brother brandham lean toward uh then
[41:21] they're most certainly most assuredly on
[41:25] the Earth right now amen and I don't
[41:27] know what they are what they know or
[41:29] what they might be aware of you know I
[41:32] know that before I mean it it it we
[41:35] should be able to see that before the
[41:39] Angel's commission to take a prophet in
[41:42] a cave and give him his the an the
[41:44] Angelic commission I mean prior to that
[41:48] people knew bill brandham as a good
[41:51] clean gospel preacher a fine young man
[41:54] in the community who had who had broken
[41:56] the cycle of his family uh from living a
[42:00] life of sin and he had become a
[42:02] well-respected minister of the Gospel he
[42:05] had baptized many down on the Ohio River
[42:08] and and and that's all he knew about
[42:10] himself until now he knew there were
[42:12] strange things happening in his life but
[42:15] until an angel met him in a cave he
[42:17] didn't understand it so I don't know who
[42:19] might say how it might turn out down the
[42:22] road when when people are become
[42:25] Believers and followers of Moses and
[42:27] Elijah and if it happens to be men who
[42:30] are anointed with that Spirit they they
[42:31] might very well say you know I used to
[42:33] know this man as a very good uh Bible
[42:37] Bel uh believer of Moses and you you
[42:40] realize that the ministry of Moses and
[42:43] Elijah is to come aware that the Messiah
[42:48] has already come and when when when
[42:53] sacrifice when offerings have been
[42:56] reestablished and brother brandham said
[42:57] it will in the in the tribulation they
[43:00] will
[43:01] reestablish sacrifices the sacrificial
[43:04] lambs and Bulls and things and it will
[43:06] be Moses and Elijah who stand up and say
[43:11] no I know you think that's the Revival
[43:13] for Israel but it's not the Revival for
[43:16] Israel the Messiah it's time for the
[43:19] atonement amen and that will be their
[43:21] message friends and that's going to
[43:23] happen in real time in this earth it's
[43:26] right on the money it's right at the
[43:28] time and I'm here to tell you we know by
[43:30] the Bible they can't go until you go up
[43:34] they can't go forward and God's not
[43:37] going to wait indefinitely to go get
[43:39] them he's going to remove a bride from
[43:42] the
[43:44] earth this his
[43:47] prophecy so now then what becomes the
[43:49] ministry of the Bride right before I
[43:52] mean I mean you know you know this in
[43:56] fact is when you think about my about my
[43:59] about my sermon you know we're we're
[44:02] summing up things at the end time we're
[44:05] summing up the world we're we're coming
[44:07] to a conclusion God has laid it on my
[44:10] heart in this series to say listen we're
[44:13] not we're not trying to get our minds
[44:15] around something coming way down the
[44:17] yellow brick road I'm telling you right
[44:20] now we're in the wrapping up we're in
[44:23] the summation of everything we're in the
[44:25] climbing of everything he's been doing
[44:28] to have a gentile Bride for 2,000 years
[44:31] and you that's why we say constantly you
[44:34] are the generation upon whom the ends of
[44:37] the world have come do you believe
[44:42] that so then so then we need to know
[44:46] what's up we need to know what's his
[44:49] plan where do we stand what should we be
[44:53] at what level should we be at amen what
[44:56] should be happening in our
[44:59] midst
[45:00] now I I just want to say
[45:03] and you know I'm going to say some
[45:06] things today that you're guaranteed not
[45:08] to hear in the average Sunday morning
[45:10] pull
[45:11] pit and there'd be no way that I would
[45:15] say them or have the audacity to say
[45:18] them nor would I have the frankly I
[45:21] wouldn't have the authority to say them
[45:23] but I can say them to you because I'm
[45:26] going to read it a prophet's saying it
[45:29] am amen there'd be no chance there
[45:32] that's why we you know that's why we
[45:34] stand squarely on the teachings of the
[45:38] scripture I said I made this statement
[45:40] to bethl Tabernacle almost 30 years ago
[45:43] I said you need to understand you've
[45:46] elected me as Pastor I stand squarely on
[45:49] the scriptures as they are taught to us
[45:51] by God's Vindicated
[45:53] messenger we have not divvied we have
[45:56] not uh shunn that we have not shunn to
[45:58] declare unto you the whole counsil of
[46:00] God am and we intend to because it's the
[46:03] only message I've ever found that gives
[46:06] me reason and purpose and I understand
[46:09] why I'm here and I understand what's
[46:10] going on and it's the thing that
[46:12] banished all fear out of my life it's
[46:14] the thing that gives me peace and
[46:16] Harmony and makes my life uh uh Dov tail
[46:20] with the Holy
[46:23] Spirit answers so many questions
[46:26] that the world is groping in anxiety and
[46:29] fear over today because they don't have
[46:31] the answers we have and they don't
[46:34] believe the answers if you tell it to
[46:35] them even they would rather it's it's
[46:38] shocking that people would rather have
[46:39] stay with their anxiety than to accept
[46:42] your
[46:43] cure the medicine we have is a cure to
[46:46] fear it casts it out it's a it's the
[46:50] it's the wherewithal to have the love of
[46:52] God in your home and in your families
[46:53] it's the it's the access to the
[46:56] supernatural because it it doesn't make
[46:59] you a super person it it but it connects
[47:02] you to a super
[47:05] person see and then that person connect
[47:08] in
[47:09] Supernatural not just natural ways but
[47:13] Supernatural
[47:16] ways and we're not ashamed of the Gospel
[47:19] it's the power of God under
[47:22] salvation God Paul is showing us here
[47:25] how that God had now spoken let me have
[47:28] my PowerPoint dubs and uh just that um
[47:31] perfect stay right there I'll I'll take
[47:33] it from
[47:36] there so God had
[47:38] now spoken
[47:41] directly through his son now now I'm
[47:43] gonna I'm going to give this to you in
[47:46] pieces because and every next piece is
[47:49] going it's going to take us a little
[47:50] further and a little further and a
[47:53] little further and I'm doing that on
[47:55] purpose because I don't want you to get
[47:56] lost in the shovel I don't just want to
[47:58] jump to the cut to the chase I want to
[48:00] show you the the structure of how God
[48:02] has done it Paul helps us here with the
[48:06] ancient days God in in sunary times and
[48:09] in diverse manners spake in times past
[48:12] unto the fathers we saw such a a display
[48:16] of that in the Youth Camp skit where you
[48:19] know it was to God the same God spoke to
[48:22] different people in different ways but
[48:24] it was always the same God
[48:26] amen and it always ended up with the
[48:29] same uh effect
[48:32] life life I want to I want to tell you
[48:35] something friends don't don't hesitate
[48:39] when God's word comes to you and speaks
[48:42] to you and says make this change stop
[48:44] this do that go here have this don't
[48:47] don't don't interfere with that just say
[48:50] yay Lord amen say yay and amen to every
[48:54] word because it is that word and your
[48:57] acceptance and your cooperation in the
[49:00] vision that brings life his vision for
[49:02] you is
[49:04] life and what does it matter you know
[49:08] this life you know what what have I to
[49:12] fear if God hath
[49:13] comprehension you know just because I
[49:15] don't know everything and just because
[49:17] it's not a flowery bed of ease and just
[49:19] because you know he doesn't he doesn't
[49:21] you know he's not like Santa Claus
[49:23] coming into our wish list that we give
[49:25] him in prayer but I know this that
[49:27] everything he touches becomes life in my
[49:31] life and everything and the more I can
[49:33] surrender the more that I can surrender
[49:36] the lighter my load Hallelujah believe
[49:42] that more that I release myself the more
[49:46] he takes
[49:47] control
[49:50] Hallelujah so God had spoken directly
[49:54] through the prophets in times past but
[49:57] he wasn't going to stay at that it
[50:01] lasted a long time amen but it wasn't
[50:05] going to stay like that he eventually
[50:08] came and stood on the earth in a human
[50:12] body and now God is speaking directly
[50:17] through his son as a human am born of a
[50:24] woman
[50:26] say why why are you emphasizing that
[50:28] brother Jason because that's something
[50:30] he had never done up to that point
[50:33] ever not even in Eden had he done
[50:37] that see he Jesus is the only begotten
[50:42] of the father am not even in Eden had he
[50:45] done that
[50:47] now all
[50:50] right the brothers and I have been en
[50:52] enjoying our Series going through spoken
[50:54] word is original seed
[50:56] and boy things brother Brenham said in
[50:58] that and then the questions and answers
[51:00] he had directly after that uh not too
[51:03] much later and he's getting asked some
[51:05] more questions about it and and things
[51:07] that he said in there and then he he
[51:09] comes all the way into 64 and 65 and
[51:11] saying the same things again and again
[51:13] and again uh we we find
[51:17] that that there would it Eden would have
[51:22] gotten
[51:23] to God speaking God living in humans
[51:29] speaking but sin interrupted that amen
[51:33] un you understand Eve would have had she
[51:36] not ran ahead she would have eventually
[51:39] come to that God had said to them be
[51:41] fruitful and
[51:42] multiply and here's a here's a point
[51:45] that I'm a little bit out of my line but
[51:47] I just think it would help you
[51:49] now when brother brandham and cod is
[51:52] asked
[51:53] about the you know the the the the whole
[51:57] thing of Genesis 1 128 we're not going
[52:00] to turn to it but Genesis 128 was where
[52:03] he he said to them be fruitful and
[52:06] multiply and replenish the Earth and
[52:09] brother brandham is emphasizing those
[52:11] conjunctions and and and and be fruitful
[52:16] and multiply and replenish the Earth and
[52:18] have dominion and and subdue it and
[52:22] brother brandham ties that all the way
[52:25] through human existence that it's it's
[52:29] going to be first of all for God to say
[52:35] multiply then God already knew brother
[52:38] bandam shows us on tape God already
[52:41] knew there's no way to multiply unless
[52:44] something dies you live by dead
[52:47] substance your body multiplies cells
[52:49] because you consume things that died you
[52:52] know and and this was brother bram's
[52:54] argument to the silliness of people who
[52:57] said you know you you should only eat
[52:58] vegetables perfectly healthy diet but
[53:01] but you know but it's not a command in
[53:04] the Bible because and and and and people
[53:07] who do it for health sake are awesome
[53:08] but sometimes you get these activists
[53:10] who just want to almost send you to hell
[53:13] because and brother brandham they tried
[53:15] to say brother brandom how could you eat
[53:17] meat and brother brandom he said why
[53:19] would I not he saidwell something died
[53:21] and brother brandom says ' well you live
[53:23] by dead substance' said if if you eat if
[53:26] you live at all you live because
[53:28] something died so oh no I don't eat
[53:30] animals said well you eat wheat the
[53:32] wheat died you eat potatoes the potato
[53:35] died you eat whatever you eat something
[53:38] had to die we only live by dead
[53:40] substance and that was a perfect type in
[53:42] Shadow of the fact that there was no way
[53:44] to have eternal life unless something
[53:46] died so that we could
[53:50] live so so then that means that Calvary
[53:54] was not God figuring it out as he went
[53:57] along Calvary when God let me tell you
[54:00] something when God created the whole
[54:02] world and mountains and pushed up from
[54:05] volcanoes God had his eye on one lowly
[54:09] small
[54:11] hill before man ever set foot on the
[54:14] earth God saw a small hill and knew
[54:17] someday I'll have a use for that
[54:19] hill Oh Hallelujah friends that's the
[54:22] one you're connected to that's the one
[54:24] who knows everything the end from the
[54:30] beginning and so he he would have he
[54:34] would have come to it she would have
[54:36] come to that but she she interrupted the
[54:39] program brother bam says but you come
[54:41] anyway now say oh yeah see God's plan
[54:44] got got ruined God's plan got
[54:49] Advanced God's plan got Advanced you
[54:52] never look at God as losing
[54:56] you never look at God as he's lost a
[54:58] battle or something caught him off guard
[55:00] I'm so glad to know that I'm so glad to
[55:04] know that that means that no wonder Paul
[55:06] could say nothing could separate me from
[55:08] him because the one who knew all the
[55:10] mistakes I would ever make love me
[55:12] anyway and chose me
[55:16] anyway and and just because I get
[55:18] knocked down doesn't mean he's defeated
[55:21] and in fact is all I got to do is get
[55:23] back up repent dust myself off and then
[55:26] I'm not
[55:30] defeated i' I've said I've said to you
[55:33] know to people who who enjoy sporting
[55:36] records I'm 60
[55:40] and0 I'm 6 and0 I've never been defeated
[55:43] in battle I'm 60 and0 brother Isaiah you
[55:45] know why because I say have you got
[55:48] knocked down lots of times I'm probably
[55:51] you know I'm probably uh probably my my
[55:55] losses would way out Pace my knockdowns
[55:58] would way out Pace you know the times I
[56:00] blasted the devil in the mug he's
[56:03] blasted me a bunch more times and
[56:04] knocked me flat on my back far more
[56:07] times than I I'm sad to say that but at
[56:09] the same time I'm still not
[56:12] defeated he's defeated every time Christ
[56:15] allows me to get back up on my feet
[56:18] Satan is defeated all over
[56:20] again say oh to what degree brother
[56:23] brandham said when you BR take a sin or
[56:26] a trespass and you repent and that and
[56:29] the Bible says if we if we repent he's
[56:31] faithful and just to forgive us he said
[56:33] he he he takes that sin and casts it in
[56:36] the sea of forgetfulness and the guilt
[56:38] of it goes back on the head of the devil
[56:41] every time I fall he's
[56:44] defeated every time I fall I get back up
[56:48] again and I plan to never stop getting
[56:52] back up
[56:53] again am I'm headed for a land where I
[56:57] won't fall
[57:02] again so we find that sin had its great
[57:06] Interruption whoops keep cutting it
[57:08] off so now we're coming to part five and
[57:12] we've been talking about the logos
[57:13] becoming the Rema this is the
[57:16] established word anytime it gets
[57:18] anointed in the life of God's family
[57:21] it's Rema word it's the same word it's
[57:23] only in a different a different
[57:26] uh it's a different form it's a
[57:29] different um connotation it's a
[57:32] different uh it's a it's a
[57:35] further understand Isaiah said a virgin
[57:38] would conceive but when Mary actually
[57:40] did it it was
[57:42] further understand that was established
[57:45] word in Isaiah but when Mary actually
[57:47] did it when Mary was told by the angel
[57:50] cuz the angel didn't tell her anything
[57:52] but what was already in the word and but
[57:54] what what what was unique was that the
[57:57] angel wasn't just repeating scripture
[58:00] because Mary already believed the Old
[58:03] Testament but what she had to say uh
[58:06] what she had to uh agree with was that
[58:09] that prophecy means
[58:11] you that this this logos is going to be
[58:15] you and she said so be it unto me and at
[58:19] that point word that had been 700 years
[58:22] old became alive and became current how
[58:25] do you get something 700 years ago
[58:28] current because the bride says Amen to
[58:31] every word and Mark 16 comes alive today
[58:34] Hebrews 13 comes alive
[58:37] today oh I'm here to tell you John
[58:39] pinned 2,000 years ago that he seen a
[58:42] great host and he heard a great shout
[58:45] and he saw great people standing on a
[58:47] mountain but some day we're going to
[58:49] become that
[58:52] word hallelujah 2,000 year prophecy will
[58:55] become
[59:01] literal so
[59:03] we're taking our subtopic as a piece off
[59:07] of the
[59:09] Masterpiece brother Bram talking about
[59:11] Michelangelo's sculpture of
[59:15] Moses and brother brandham contrary
[59:19] to the rest of the
[59:21] world brother brand said to me
[59:25] the the flaw they saidoh this was his
[59:27] Masterpiece but it's got a little flaw
[59:29] here because he lost it and hit it
[59:31] brother brandham said the flaw is what
[59:35] made it a
[59:36] masterpiece not how wonderfully it was
[59:39] crafted how authentic it looked that it
[59:41] was Michelangelo himself that the detail
[59:44] was so fine that I mean listen friends
[59:48] there there was there was lots of
[59:50] sculptors in the world who could have
[59:51] done that also so brother Brandon was
[59:54] not not saying it's of such a high
[59:56] quality reproduction of Moses that this
[59:59] is what makes it a masterpiece brother M
[1:00:01] said no to me it's the flaw because it
[1:00:05] was because it was the flaw that struck
[1:00:07] the Lord Jesus it was the it was that
[1:00:10] day on Calvary it was the wound in his
[1:00:13] side The Thorn on his head the nails in
[1:00:16] his hands and feet oh let me tell you
[1:00:18] something friends and he said a piece
[1:00:20] flew off of that and he said and you it
[1:00:23] has an indent
[1:00:25] today it has an indention today where
[1:00:27] you can feel where that flaw that piece
[1:00:30] flew off so when brother brandham says
[1:00:32] to me that's what made it a masterpiece
[1:00:35] that makes perfect sense to me
[1:00:37] because the thing to me that makes it a
[1:00:41] masterpiece is that there's another
[1:00:43] piece off of the
[1:00:47] Masterpiece so I had a masterpiece that
[1:00:49] day on Calvary but I came out of him I'm
[1:00:52] a piece off of the master
[1:00:55] peace hallelujah oh I'm here to tell you
[1:00:59] something friends there's no Lord like
[1:01:00] the Lord
[1:01:04] Jesus so brother brandham says here now
[1:01:07] before the foundation of the world when
[1:01:09] God created You In His Image or created
[1:01:11] The Man In His Image and created the
[1:01:14] woman the image of the man for the glory
[1:01:17] of the man he made you theophany just
[1:01:20] like himself when he said let us to the
[1:01:23] creatures that he had made let us make
[1:01:25] man in our image and our likeness a
[1:01:28] theophany God had never become flesh yet
[1:01:32] he was in a theophany right so I've said
[1:01:34] to you he spoke in Jesus Christ a man
[1:01:38] born of a woman he spoke directly
[1:01:40] through him he had never done that all
[1:01:42] the way back to Eden see
[1:01:45] watch said well eventually Adam got the
[1:01:48] flesh right but Adam still wasn't born
[1:01:50] of a
[1:01:51] woman Adam was the son of God but the
[1:01:55] second Adam was the only begotten Son of
[1:01:57] God see it's all God with his plan for
[1:02:01] Redemption to save a lost Humanity
[1:02:04] because that's why I said when Satan did
[1:02:06] what he did in the Garden of Eden God
[1:02:08] didn't lose that wasn't a subtraction
[1:02:11] that was an
[1:02:12] advancement because that the fall in the
[1:02:15] garden allowed God to now become a
[1:02:18] redeemer and so everything the devil's
[1:02:20] ever done to try to upset the the plan
[1:02:24] of God all it's ever done is Advance the
[1:02:28] kingdom
[1:02:31] see we would say
[1:02:34] today wow how tragic that brother
[1:02:37] brandham would would would to God that
[1:02:39] he could still be among us his loss
[1:02:42] Advanced the kingdom
[1:02:46] yes what else would you believe that
[1:02:48] Satan sucker punched God and took his
[1:02:50] Prophet
[1:02:51] out his loss say that was terrible how
[1:02:54] Paul had to die that advanced the
[1:02:56] kingdom John had to go to to the island
[1:02:58] of patmas get his eyes punched out be
[1:03:00] boiled in oil that advanced the kingdom
[1:03:02] the people were scattered all over that
[1:03:04] advanced the kingdom see watch
[1:03:09] now so he was in a
[1:03:23] theophonic
[1:03:24] had to become flesh first
[1:03:27] amen thus what all right now so I just
[1:03:31] want to make a statement to you all
[1:03:34] right man could not directly come and
[1:03:38] partake of that tree of life in the
[1:03:39] midst of the garden that eternal life of
[1:03:41] the tree had to become flesh first so
[1:03:44] Christ and Satan are both in the garden
[1:03:47] we know that neither one of them are in
[1:03:53] flesh Satan
[1:03:55] first of all he's really up against it
[1:03:57] cuz he can't even
[1:03:58] create but he but there's a serpent that
[1:04:01] God created who had a place for a soul
[1:04:04] but he didn't have a soul but he had a
[1:04:05] place for one and so Satan took that
[1:04:08] place and now the serpent can suddenly
[1:04:10] rationalize and reason and think see now
[1:04:14] he has a conscience so and and so Satan
[1:04:17] now what's Satan trying to do get to
[1:04:20] flesh what's what's Christ trying to do
[1:04:22] get into flesh because what's the what's
[1:04:26] the plan there's a kingdom coming that
[1:04:29] the Lord is just starting and he's he's
[1:04:32] he's building out a future Kingdom
[1:04:35] that's going to be filled with people
[1:04:38] who are in bodies not just theophanies
[1:04:42] even he wasn't going to stay just
[1:04:45] theophany he wanted a body a body has
[1:04:48] thou prepared me he said beh it is
[1:04:51] written in the Scrolls concerning me I
[1:04:53] have come to do thy will oh God a body
[1:04:57] has in sacrifices and offerings thou
[1:04:58] wouldest not but a body hast thou
[1:05:00] prepared
[1:05:02] me so so we find that that what's in
[1:05:07] play if neither Christ nor Satan are in
[1:05:10] the flesh in the garden then what's in
[1:05:12] play brother Jason something here's
[1:05:14] what's here's what was in play it was
[1:05:16] going to be something that was going to
[1:05:19] happen in the
[1:05:21] flesh cuz after a while God put Adam in
[1:05:24] flesh and then took Eve out of him in
[1:05:26] flesh and then Satan comes and gets in
[1:05:29] the serpent in now he's in flesh animal
[1:05:32] flesh not a human very close to the
[1:05:35] human see upright could talk could
[1:05:39] think I I I it it makes us laugh when we
[1:05:42] see artistic artist depictions of a
[1:05:46] snake hanging in a tree
[1:05:49] talking that's silly that's childhood
[1:05:52] nonsense see and it wasn't a snake he
[1:05:55] was more subtle than any beast of the
[1:05:56] field the thing could talk and think and
[1:05:58] walk around and could actually and could
[1:06:02] actually have carnal knowledge with a
[1:06:04] human woman it's not a snake like you
[1:06:07] would see today crawling on the ground
[1:06:10] all right so so we find he's the missing
[1:06:12] link God cursed his body and so when we
[1:06:17] realize that what's in play you don't
[1:06:19] you you have Christ and Satan in the
[1:06:21] Garden of Eden neither one of them are
[1:06:23] in flesh but what's in play is that
[1:06:26] something is going to happen in flesh
[1:06:30] influenced by one of these two trees
[1:06:34] amen they both came with a
[1:06:39] word one was true the other was false am
[1:06:46] and so so this is why brother Brandon
[1:06:49] would say when God said multiply he
[1:06:52] already knew that that nothing could
[1:06:54] multiply unless something died so even
[1:06:56] in Genesis 1:28 even before they're in
[1:07:00] flesh you're finding that God already
[1:07:03] had redemption in his mind and he's
[1:07:06] saying multiply well if something wait a
[1:07:09] minute how am I going to do that
[1:07:10] something's got to die yeah but you'll
[1:07:12] understand it better by and by just
[1:07:14] follow my word this you understand this
[1:07:16] was all a
[1:07:18] planen that God could foresee down in
[1:07:21] the future and brother Brenham actually
[1:07:24] shows us that that goes all the way that
[1:07:26] and and and and and he said see that
[1:07:29] come all the way up out of the garden it
[1:07:31] went all the way through the Old
[1:07:32] Testament and what were they doing and
[1:07:35] multiplying and and replenishing and
[1:07:38] taking a stand for the word of God God's
[1:07:40] family God in Sund Dr time spoke through
[1:07:43] the
[1:07:43] prophets what were they doing they were
[1:07:46] and Prophets spoke and more prophets and
[1:07:48] people believed you understand the
[1:07:51] kingdom is being built until it comes
[1:07:53] into to Jesus Christ and he stands in a
[1:07:55] human
[1:07:56] body is he finished no sir he's going to
[1:08:01] he said a little while the world won't
[1:08:03] see me but you will cuz I will be not
[1:08:05] just with you but I'll be in you that
[1:08:08] was the promise of the Jubilee Israel
[1:08:10] refused it the Gentiles took it and the
[1:08:13] Holy Ghost fell in the upper room and
[1:08:15] now that same God was living in human
[1:08:18] bodies
[1:08:20] again to to what degree even their sh
[1:08:23] Shadow was healing people
[1:08:28] amen so brother Ram said it's just and
[1:08:31] this and that and this and and brother
[1:08:33] Brenham says and have dominion so
[1:08:37] brother Brenham says that goes all the
[1:08:40] way out to the Millennium amen so this
[1:08:45] be fruitful and multiply and replenish
[1:08:48] the Earth and have dominion over the
[1:08:51] fish of the sea over the fowls of the
[1:08:52] air over every living thing that
[1:08:54] creepeth upon the Earth so so you find
[1:08:57] that God has a plan I'm here to tell you
[1:09:00] something friends you're on your way to
[1:09:03] the Millennium hallelujah it's
[1:09:05] Unstoppable the word is taking you
[1:09:09] there
[1:09:12] Hallelujah so brother B goes
[1:09:15] on thus what God worked out here in the
[1:09:18] garden was his predestinated plan I mean
[1:09:21] this is everything this is the fall this
[1:09:23] Tak it all in his predestinated plan see
[1:09:28] because there was no way that the tree
[1:09:31] of life could be partaken of directly
[1:09:34] because it had to first become flesh
[1:09:37] that's part of God's plan
[1:09:39] see thus what God worked out here in the
[1:09:41] garden was his predestinated plan and
[1:09:43] when Satan had brought about that which
[1:09:46] was I love that language when Satan had
[1:09:50] defeated God and won the
[1:09:52] kingdom did I read that
[1:09:55] right when when Satan became the
[1:09:57] champion and beat God down and took his
[1:09:59] family and took all of his
[1:10:02] power when Satan had brought about that
[1:10:05] which was necessary to the purpose of
[1:10:09] God can I say it this way when the
[1:10:12] puppet brought the plan that was
[1:10:15] necessary for
[1:10:18] you you say thank you
[1:10:22] puppet
[1:10:24] then man could not get to the Tree of
[1:10:27] Life In The Garden certainly not now
[1:10:29] look at that phrase it wasn't
[1:10:33] time so that that immediately informs
[1:10:37] your thinking that it's eventually going
[1:10:39] to be time it's just not right there in
[1:10:41] Genesis you understand you're with
[1:10:46] me but an animal animal had caused the
[1:10:49] fall had it not let the let animal life
[1:10:53] be
[1:10:54] shed was taken the animal was taken and
[1:10:57] his blood shed and then God had
[1:11:01] communion with men with man again it's
[1:11:04] mankind then there was to come a day
[1:11:08] when God would appear in flesh who
[1:11:11] would God would appear in flesh and by
[1:11:13] means of his
[1:11:15] humiliation he would restore Fallen man
[1:11:19] and make him a partaker of that eternal
[1:11:22] life
[1:11:24] so you are Hees of God and you are joint
[1:11:30] heirs with Christ see so because you're
[1:11:34] you're in the same family and you have
[1:11:36] received his life into your life so as
[1:11:39] an air of God you you differ nothing
[1:11:42] from a a servant though you be Lord of
[1:11:44] all because you're an heir of God before
[1:11:46] you were ever born again you were
[1:11:48] already a child of God Amen you but but
[1:11:51] in but in application you differed
[1:11:53] nothing nothing from everybody else you
[1:11:54] were just a ranked sinner see but God
[1:11:57] rich in Mercy loved us right so so we
[1:12:01] find out that as an heir yes you were an
[1:12:03] heir of God but you had you had nothing
[1:12:06] allotted to you there was an allotment
[1:12:09] but it wasn't allotted to you because
[1:12:10] you were in sin but now we have become
[1:12:13] joint heirs with Christ now there's not
[1:12:16] only an allotment of eternal life but
[1:12:18] it's allotted to you and you're a
[1:12:21] possessor of that eternal life
[1:12:25] amen you with
[1:12:28] me so he's going to make him a
[1:12:31] partaker of that eternal life my
[1:12:35] goodness time is zooming on me it's okay
[1:12:38] I'm just G to carry on
[1:12:41] along I'm trying not to
[1:12:48] Freestyle all right let me get to where
[1:12:50] I need to
[1:12:52] be
[1:12:54] all right
[1:12:55] so so then we come here to Christ is the
[1:12:58] mystery of God revealed tremendous
[1:13:01] tremendous message it's one you need to
[1:13:03] hear about 20
[1:13:05] times look Christ in you makes him the
[1:13:10] center of life of the Revelation amen
[1:13:15] see Christ's life in you makes him the
[1:13:19] center of the Revelation Christ in the
[1:13:22] Bible makes the Bible the complete
[1:13:25] revelation of Christ Christ in you makes
[1:13:29] you the complete revelation of the whole
[1:13:32] thing see what God is trying to do
[1:13:37] friends I don't know what happened to
[1:13:41] you this week but do you see what God is
[1:13:44] trying to do I have no way to forecast
[1:13:48] what next week holds for you but just
[1:13:50] remember it's God doing something
[1:13:54] something Hallelujah I mean that just
[1:13:57] takes the whole that just deflates as
[1:14:00] brother brandham said de horns the devil
[1:14:02] no wonder I say to you he ain't
[1:14:05] nobody because it doesn't even matter if
[1:14:08] he get what if he gets what looks like a
[1:14:10] victory and even if you're culpable in
[1:14:13] it it still doesn't matter it's just
[1:14:16] advancing God's
[1:14:19] plan
[1:14:21] wow see
[1:14:23] it's it's it's it's what God is trying
[1:14:26] to do what is the new birth then you'd
[1:14:30] say well brother brandham what is the
[1:14:34] new birth it is the revelation of Jesus
[1:14:39] Christ personally to you amen see not
[1:14:43] you joined a church you shook a hand you
[1:14:47] done something different you set a Creed
[1:14:50] you promised to live by a code of
[1:14:55] rules it's not about your wins and
[1:14:58] losses or that you live legalistically a
[1:15:03] perfect Flawless
[1:15:04] life it's not about that see you you
[1:15:09] didn't do you didn't really do anything
[1:15:13] other than what Mary did and believe the
[1:15:15] word am yes amen you say should I have
[1:15:20] done more than that no because if you
[1:15:22] did more than that then that gives you
[1:15:24] glory and that's not what the plan's
[1:15:26] about the whole thing is for His glory
[1:15:30] so he puts a piece of himself in you
[1:15:32] then sends a piece of himself to match
[1:15:34] the piece of himself and this says the
[1:15:36] word and you say amen and this is logos
[1:15:39] and this becomes Rema and you go forth
[1:15:41] as a son and daughter of God you did
[1:15:44] nothing to earn it you did nothing to
[1:15:46] keep it you can't get away from it it
[1:15:50] chased you down and in some cases
[1:15:53] knocked you down and if you're still
[1:15:55] running it will knock you
[1:15:59] down see but Christ
[1:16:04] watch but Christ the Bible he is the
[1:16:09] word that was revealed to you and no
[1:16:11] matter what anybody says what takes
[1:16:15] place it's Christ see Pastor priest
[1:16:19] whatever it might be it's Christ in you
[1:16:23] that is the Revelation that the church
[1:16:25] was built
[1:16:27] upon I'm so
[1:16:29] glad you know there's there's some of
[1:16:32] you here today who I'm the only Pastor
[1:16:35] you've ever known you were your parents
[1:16:38] were single and part of my youth group
[1:16:40] and then the Lord joined them together
[1:16:42] and they had children and I dedicated
[1:16:44] you to the Lord at this very at this
[1:16:46] altar or maybe in the A-frame or
[1:16:48] somewhere else but that's not the Story
[1:16:51] of All of Us amen
[1:16:54] some of us we didn't always have a
[1:16:57] pastor or a priest brother brandham says
[1:16:59] doesn't matter Pastor priest whatever it
[1:17:01] was some of us didn't have a pastor or a
[1:17:04] priest who always operated with our best
[1:17:07] interest in mind
[1:17:10] am amen but we kept going yes
[1:17:14] sir for some of us life happened in
[1:17:19] ways boy I have to say Amen to this that
[1:17:23] could have finished
[1:17:25] me could have finished us come on life
[1:17:29] has happened in ways that should have
[1:17:31] finished
[1:17:32] us amen hard Curves in the road that not
[1:17:38] could have or should have it would have
[1:17:40] finished us but somehow we're still here
[1:17:44] somehow we kept
[1:17:48] going sometimes we drove off the road
[1:17:50] ourselves but some power h than my own
[1:17:53] Reckless will brought me back on the
[1:17:56] road every time Hallelujah who keeps
[1:17:59] saving me who keeps saving us who keep
[1:18:01] say to this who keeps saving me and then
[1:18:03] say right behind it not
[1:18:05] me who keeps saving you not you there's
[1:18:09] something higher than
[1:18:11] you that's known you your entire life
[1:18:15] and and and and as brother Matt reminded
[1:18:17] us this Wednesday you know we're in this
[1:18:19] race friends H we're not racing our
[1:18:21] fellow brothers and sisters you know who
[1:18:24] we racing the devil and guess who wins
[1:18:27] me you not only am I racing I'm going to
[1:18:32] win
[1:18:34] hallelu
[1:18:39] hallelujah it's Christ being
[1:18:42] revealed and he is the
[1:18:45] word and when the word is revealed it
[1:18:48] expresses itself see see see you see
[1:18:51] that is that is that easy look at it
[1:18:54] again it's Christ being revealed and he
[1:18:56] is the word and when the word is
[1:18:58] revealed it's it it expresses itself
[1:19:01] that's God's purpose for Jesus Christ
[1:19:04] was to express himself to take his own
[1:19:06] laws and live by his laws fulfill his
[1:19:09] law by
[1:19:11] death that's that's exactly why he came
[1:19:16] and
[1:19:17] Christ God died in flesh and he is the
[1:19:22] word and when the word is revealed it
[1:19:25] expresses itself see that's God's
[1:19:28] purpose for Jesus Christ was to are we
[1:19:31] we we I'm sorry I'm reading the wrong
[1:19:32] one and Christ God died in flesh in
[1:19:35] order to condemn sin in the flesh that
[1:19:39] he might bring himself a glorious bride
[1:19:42] redeemed back that will believe only his
[1:19:46] word of God you see that's that's what
[1:19:49] Eve failed on she stopped believing
[1:19:54] every word of God Amen she had the word
[1:19:58] of God but she let some other
[1:20:01] manifestation In the Flesh talk her out
[1:20:04] of it that's exactly what Israel did the
[1:20:07] same thing that Adam found in his bride
[1:20:10] Jehovah found in his bride and they came
[1:20:13] to Samuel and said make us a king and it
[1:20:16] broke Samuel's heart and he says God is
[1:20:19] your king they said fine God is our King
[1:20:21] but we want another we want
[1:20:23] like everybody else has it just shows
[1:20:25] that they were only mental Believers
[1:20:27] their heart wasn't really their heart
[1:20:28] was far from God they wanted
[1:20:32] modernization and it broke Samuel's
[1:20:35] heart and God come to him and said
[1:20:36] Samuel they haven't rejected you they've
[1:20:40] did what Eve did to Adam they've
[1:20:42] rejected me they have taken another man
[1:20:46] to rule over them oh my this is exactly
[1:20:50] what Jesus ran into and when in the
[1:20:53] church ages the the the early church had
[1:20:56] the perfect word they were perfect for a
[1:20:59] couple of decades they had the
[1:21:02] Jubilee amen they had the Feast of
[1:21:05] Pentecost they had the token they had
[1:21:09] the abstract title they had rapturing
[1:21:12] Faith they had the pillar of fire they
[1:21:15] had prophets and
[1:21:16] apostles amen now they they couldn't go
[1:21:19] into the Rapture although they were they
[1:21:21] perfectly could have except for the fact
[1:21:23] that the seed to fill out the type had
[1:21:25] to go into the
[1:21:27] ground because there was more names on
[1:21:29] the book then was just in that first age
[1:21:33] my name was in that book so he he he
[1:21:36] couldn't let them go in the Rapture but
[1:21:37] they could have until they started to
[1:21:40] backslide oh my friends and by the time
[1:21:44] so now instead of Christ being able he
[1:21:47] comes to get his bride at NAA he finds
[1:21:50] her just like Eve did like Adam did just
[1:21:52] like Jehovah did now Christ finds his
[1:21:55] bride defiled she's taken another man
[1:21:57] instead of Christ the word am and
[1:22:00] instead of Christ being able to take a
[1:22:02] bride home he now must sit down in the
[1:22:05] eternities and under the ministry of the
[1:22:07] Son of God start interceding as a high
[1:22:09] priest on behalf of the ignorance he
[1:22:12] seals up the word under Seven Seals and
[1:22:15] wraps it all up and not becomes an
[1:22:16] encrypted mystery and they probe at it
[1:22:19] look at it and guess at it and live by
[1:22:21] it and a partial seal opens and a
[1:22:23] messenger catches it just enough light
[1:22:25] people run with it he he saves his
[1:22:27] family out of there but it's filled with
[1:22:29] all kinds of errors but at the end time
[1:22:32] the alpha would become the Omega what
[1:22:35] was at the first would be at the last
[1:22:37] and this time there's a bride on the
[1:22:39] earth who doesn't have any more ages and
[1:22:42] will not fail she's predestinated to not
[1:22:46] fall like Eve or like Israel or like the
[1:22:50] first church she's going to to finish
[1:22:53] this thing see so he
[1:22:55] says he died in the flesh in order to
[1:22:59] condemn sin in the flesh that he might
[1:23:02] bring to himself a glorious bride
[1:23:03] redeemed back that will believe only in
[1:23:07] the word of God and not swap it like Eve
[1:23:10] did for intellectual conceptions of man
[1:23:12] you see it that's Christ's idea that's
[1:23:16] God's idea the new birth reveals this
[1:23:22] amen amen and he goes right back then
[1:23:25] what does the new birth produce watch
[1:23:28] Jesus said Mark 16 these signs shall
[1:23:32] follow them that believe uh see this is
[1:23:35] this is actually this takes in when he
[1:23:38] said be fruitful multiply replenish the
[1:23:41] Earth have dominion then brother brandom
[1:23:44] I didn't read it for you there in 1954
[1:23:47] when he's breaking all that down he
[1:23:49] comes about five or six paragraphs under
[1:23:51] that and he goes to 1 Corinthians 12
[1:23:54] because 1 Corinthians 12 there's this
[1:23:56] whole debate over the gifts of the
[1:23:59] Spirit as brother Matt was talking about
[1:24:01] Wednesday night but I'm here to tell you
[1:24:03] the holy go the plan of the Holy Ghost
[1:24:05] is he was always to have control of
[1:24:07] those gifts it was never supposed to be
[1:24:10] under the control of
[1:24:11] people and every time people have tried
[1:24:14] to usurp it it's always been a mess I'm
[1:24:17] here to tell you something friends every
[1:24:19] time anybody's ever rose up to try to
[1:24:22] bring on the make the third pole come
[1:24:24] ahead of its time try to make it a
[1:24:26] Doctrine try to make it a movement try
[1:24:28] to make it a gift try to make it a
[1:24:29] supernatural try to make it a shout try
[1:24:31] to make it try to make it try to make it
[1:24:33] all it does is cause confusion and leave
[1:24:35] people disillusion you don't need to
[1:24:38] worry in his time he's making all of
[1:24:41] this
[1:24:44] beautiful God is bringing it forth the
[1:24:47] only our only obligation as I preached
[1:24:50] to you some months ago your oblig ation
[1:24:52] is dedication and consecration it's not
[1:24:56] for you to try to make it happen it's to
[1:24:58] you to be dedicated and consecrated and
[1:25:01] God will make happen what he wants to
[1:25:04] make
[1:25:05] happen then every Power is subject to
[1:25:09] you then the token can be applied to
[1:25:11] your
[1:25:12] home then you take every Spirit under
[1:25:14] your control for the glory of
[1:25:16] God it doesn't come because you're smart
[1:25:19] or because you're you're energetic or
[1:25:22] because your charismatic has nothing to
[1:25:24] do with any of that it's about a humble
[1:25:26] life broken before God and surrendered
[1:25:30] in
[1:25:31] everything so that God can move and God
[1:25:34] can get
[1:25:36] Glory it's casting out devils and
[1:25:38] speaking with tongues and all these
[1:25:40] great manifestations of gifts that would
[1:25:42] follow that they shall not they may be
[1:25:46] they ought to they will
[1:25:50] am the Life of Christ in the church will
[1:25:54] produce these things in God's time in
[1:25:58] God's way he doesn't need you to help
[1:26:02] him he doesn't need counsel or advice
[1:26:05] from you all he needs is a surrendered
[1:26:09] heart amen you know I I had to learn
[1:26:13] that through a lot of tough
[1:26:16] Trials of you know brother bradam talks
[1:26:18] about it how that pastors go through a
[1:26:21] lot of things the church never knows
[1:26:23] nothing about says and brother brandom
[1:26:25] just actually kind of cracks open the
[1:26:27] secret vault and says you know I know
[1:26:29] brother Neville goes through a lot of
[1:26:31] things y'all don't know about I happen
[1:26:32] to know it and he said sometimes you
[1:26:34] look in the word of God and you see the
[1:26:36] promise and you preach it to the people
[1:26:38] and then it looks like it doesn't come
[1:26:39] to pass and people hang on to it and
[1:26:41] believe it and you trumpet it and and
[1:26:43] then it seems to fall and fail and he
[1:26:45] says these things you know we don't
[1:26:47] always understand these things but you
[1:26:50] know I I I learned from the Lord one day
[1:26:53] and I and I was I was looking at that
[1:26:54] scripture same one brother brandham you
[1:26:56] know I if you say to this mountain there
[1:26:59] or another one if you ask anything in my
[1:27:02] name and don't doubt it but believe that
[1:27:04] what you have said you shall receive
[1:27:07] then you shall have it see and and I and
[1:27:10] and and you know we had a an 18mon long
[1:27:13] episode and and six of our dearest
[1:27:16] Saints sleep now uh in beneath the sod
[1:27:21] and they're in heaven
[1:27:23] amen and here we were as a church
[1:27:25] praying testifying believing six out of
[1:27:29] six times and six out of six times the
[1:27:32] Lord took them home was real close to my
[1:27:35] heart two of them was my
[1:27:37] family and I just knew and even even
[1:27:41] with my baby Brethren I'm
[1:27:44] saying I mean there's no way to to tell
[1:27:47] you the feeling when it's it's 4:00 a.m.
[1:27:51] my phone rings and it's brother Andrew
[1:27:53] and I'm thinking oh goodness something
[1:27:55] must be wrong and I'm talking to brother
[1:27:57] Andrew and I'm trying to get awake thank
[1:27:59] God it was brother Andrew that is such a
[1:28:01] comfort to me to this day that it was
[1:28:03] brother Andrew telling me this and not
[1:28:05] just some cold doctor somewhere and he's
[1:28:08] saying brother Jason your brother was
[1:28:10] brought in oh my well what's going on
[1:28:13] brother Andrew how is he said well and
[1:28:15] he just so so just as kindly as he could
[1:28:19] he said brother Jason he's deceased
[1:28:23] and I just fell in a chair I couldn't
[1:28:26] believe
[1:28:27] it and you know the story and and then
[1:28:31] we got to gather a whole family on a
[1:28:32] Sunday morning and go and break the news
[1:28:34] to sister Jean and I've never heard my
[1:28:37] mom wh like that never in my whole life
[1:28:39] never heard her wh like that to lose a
[1:28:42] baby who had only lost a husband of 60
[1:28:45] plus years only 13 months
[1:28:48] prior and sister Jean is going around
[1:28:50] the funeral comforting other
[1:28:52] people people say to me how's your mom I
[1:28:55] say my mom's a superhero I don't even
[1:28:57] understand her I can't figure it out
[1:28:59] where that kind of strength comes
[1:29:01] from and she has her sad times and her
[1:29:04] times of crying but I asked her one time
[1:29:07] I said Mom how how are you
[1:29:10] okay you know and she said look I have
[1:29:12] my times of crying she said but I have
[1:29:15] to be okay and I said what does that
[1:29:17] even mean what do you mean you have to
[1:29:19] be okay she said Jason I am not the
[1:29:21] first daughter of God to lose a husband
[1:29:24] and a child down through thousands of
[1:29:27] years my fellow sisters have lost
[1:29:29] husbands and children and she said and
[1:29:31] they kept pressing the battle she said
[1:29:33] I'm pressing the battle I have to be
[1:29:35] okay I'm here to tell you some friends
[1:29:37] we've all had our ups and downs but I
[1:29:39] I'm going to be okay and the devil can
[1:29:42] do whatever he wants but we're going to
[1:29:44] be okay because we're pressing and
[1:29:47] marching to
[1:29:50] Zion amen and and I stood there I was a
[1:29:53] couple days later and I was talking to
[1:29:54] the Lord I said Lord by this time I'm so
[1:29:57] broken I can't believe it how many have
[1:29:59] been lost and all of us praying and
[1:30:01] confessing and I said but Lord I I
[1:30:03] believe that you told me that my brother
[1:30:06] would be saved I believe you told me
[1:30:08] that and the Lord said I did save him
[1:30:10] and the only way I
[1:30:12] could cuz God wouldn't force himself and
[1:30:15] so he took my brother home a a wayward
[1:30:19] son and brother brandham said you you he
[1:30:22] said you mothers it's right on tape he
[1:30:24] said you got a wayward child all right
[1:30:28] here he said you take the same faith
[1:30:31] that you believe for your own salvation
[1:30:33] and you apply it to that child he said
[1:30:36] that wayward child and you just start
[1:30:38] confessing it and you start believing it
[1:30:41] don't you never change it and said if
[1:30:43] you die and you never see
[1:30:46] it in your lifetime you never see it
[1:30:49] happen said on the res Resurrection when
[1:30:53] you come up that faith will still be
[1:30:55] burning in your heart cuz death changes
[1:30:57] nothing and God will have to answer to
[1:31:00] that Faith at that time and bring them
[1:31:03] in oh I'm telling you there's power in
[1:31:06] the blood there's power in your
[1:31:08] testimony to believe
[1:31:10] God
[1:31:13] Amen and after preaching a funeral here
[1:31:17] what do we average every few months six
[1:31:20] people over 18 months that's about every
[1:31:22] 3 months we're preaching a
[1:31:26] funeral and I'm in my back office and
[1:31:28] I'm just broken by it and I just said
[1:31:30] Lord You're G to have to help me because
[1:31:33] something in my faith is broken now I
[1:31:36] don't mean my faith in the word of the
[1:31:37] message I'm talking about that not
[1:31:39] talking about my confession in Christ
[1:31:40] and the message of the hour that that's
[1:31:42] impossible Satan would I would die
[1:31:44] before I would ever see because that's a
[1:31:46] part of me I'd have to deny my own
[1:31:47] existence I'm talking about my faith to
[1:31:50] believe in the promise if you ask
[1:31:51] anything and my name don't doubt it and
[1:31:54] I was asking the Lord that but Lord you
[1:31:56] know you said if I ask anything in your
[1:31:58] name and don't doubt it and we didn't
[1:31:59] doubt it we confessed it and we believed
[1:32:02] it the Lord is so
[1:32:06] amazing come right down in that office
[1:32:08] right back there where he's the
[1:32:11] pastor sit right down across from me
[1:32:13] like you've done many
[1:32:16] times
[1:32:20] said how many many times have you
[1:32:24] counseled families
[1:32:26] parents sitting in this very chair and
[1:32:29] I'm suddenly I'm I'm in another place
[1:32:31] and I'm having a conversation and I'm
[1:32:33] looking at a chair and I said many times
[1:32:36] Lord he said you you've counseled
[1:32:39] fathers and mothers with children and
[1:32:41] wayward children and or problems in the
[1:32:44] home or problems in finances or problems
[1:32:46] in the marriage between the husband and
[1:32:48] the wife and problems with juveniles and
[1:32:50] problems with this and and that the
[1:32:52] other yes Lord yes many times I thought
[1:32:54] where's this going and the Lord just
[1:32:56] said to
[1:32:58] me have you
[1:33:00] ever had anyone sitting in these chairs
[1:33:03] have you ever sat a father and a mother
[1:33:07] down in front of you and said to them I
[1:33:10] think that you should let the children
[1:33:12] run the
[1:33:16] home
[1:33:18] amen have you ever said to a father or
[1:33:22] mother you know my opinion is you should
[1:33:25] let the children make the
[1:33:28] decisions I already knew where this was
[1:33:32] headed I bowed my head I said no Lord
[1:33:35] I've never never would I think of such a
[1:33:38] thing I would never tell a set of
[1:33:41] parents I would never tell a father you
[1:33:43] need to let the child make the decisions
[1:33:46] for the home I said I would never do
[1:33:48] I've never done that I would never do
[1:33:50] that he said then why
[1:33:52] do you question me am I not your
[1:33:54] heavenly father Yes Lord you are then do
[1:33:58] you think I should let my children run
[1:34:00] the kingdom and make the
[1:34:07] decisions that was such a healing to me
[1:34:11] but now I still had a
[1:34:13] question and when I got God close I try
[1:34:16] to gently ask my
[1:34:19] questions and so I just said I felt like
[1:34:21] Abraham like I know I'm taking my life
[1:34:23] into my hands please don't be angry with
[1:34:25] me I'll speak once more I said but Lord
[1:34:29] then okay I get it I understand I get it
[1:34:32] but why did you say that then if that's
[1:34:36] how you were going to roll why did you
[1:34:38] say it like that say what you said that
[1:34:41] if I ask you the father anything in your
[1:34:43] name and don't doubt it but believe that
[1:34:45] I that I'll receive it then I'll have it
[1:34:48] and that Gentle Savior spoke right back
[1:34:51] to me and said because the reason I said
[1:34:53] it that way is because that's how I want
[1:34:57] you to believe it every time you
[1:35:02] pray healing is an
[1:35:05] understatement regeneration is an
[1:35:08] understatement I felt like I could run I
[1:35:10] felt like John Dan I want to
[1:35:13] run oh friends there's no kind of
[1:35:16] healing like comes in the word of God
[1:35:19] I'm here to tell you something friends
[1:35:21] let this word be your guide let God have
[1:35:24] control of your life stop doing like
[1:35:28] Paul kicking against the prick stop
[1:35:30] running try stop trying to figure it all
[1:35:33] out God's in
[1:35:36] control Matt can I give a little bit of
[1:35:38] your
[1:35:41] testimonies so I'm gonna tell you a
[1:35:43] little story you have to understand that
[1:35:45] to me he's he's Mammy so he was a cute
[1:35:49] little button of a boy when I first met
[1:35:51] him little guy and uh Katie thinks he's
[1:35:55] adorable
[1:35:59] still Brainiac from five years
[1:36:04] old you know by the time he was seven
[1:36:07] the family quit challenging him on on
[1:36:09] things because he was too smart so he
[1:36:11] goes off to
[1:36:14] college heads off there to those
[1:36:18] uh liberal think tanks and propaganda
[1:36:22] machines listen up Ry listen up this
[1:36:26] will help
[1:36:28] you and after years of that nonsense
[1:36:33] it's even pushing against his raising
[1:36:36] this is why it's so important to raise
[1:36:40] them in the word in the way that they
[1:36:43] should go that alone brother Dale and
[1:36:47] sister Joanne's daily weekly monthly
[1:36:50] yearly practice of Prayer in the home
[1:36:53] and opening the Bible and reading and
[1:36:55] teaching that made my job so much easier
[1:36:59] because I was dealing with a young man
[1:37:00] who had been raised on the word now
[1:37:03] three four years probably four years of
[1:37:06] of liberal woke IND doctrination had his
[1:37:09] mind in a
[1:37:11] confusion and I I I hear that he's not
[1:37:14] he's back he's not doing good I said oh
[1:37:15] my goodness hard to believe and so I I
[1:37:20] called him hey Ma can we get together
[1:37:23] sure brother Jason and so you know I'm
[1:37:26] I'm praying and I hear that wow it's
[1:37:28] it's it's worse than you think you just
[1:37:30] better be prepared and what and I I
[1:37:33] couldn't hardly imagine that that that
[1:37:36] liberal institution had almost turned
[1:37:38] our brother into an atheist now they
[1:37:40] wouldn't have succeeded the Lord was
[1:37:42] always going to win the battle but his
[1:37:44] mind was in such a confusion and and and
[1:37:47] I'm praying a couple days before I meet
[1:37:50] him and I'm praying talking to the Lord
[1:37:51] Lord and I said Lord I'm going to be up
[1:37:54] against it I'm going to need your help
[1:37:56] and the Lord came down just like he did
[1:37:58] in the office now I'm in my home office
[1:38:01] and sat right down in front of me and
[1:38:03] said okay here's his problem cut right
[1:38:06] to the chase don't bother with anything
[1:38:08] else his problem is on the sovereignty
[1:38:11] of God just explain it to him out of the
[1:38:13] Bible because he's struggling with God's
[1:38:16] sovereignty and election and salvation
[1:38:19] and Redemption and God is sovereign
[1:38:22] happens to be one of my favorite
[1:38:23] subjects it's deals with election an
[1:38:26] election based on
[1:38:27] origin and I and I said okay Lord that's
[1:38:30] easy enough that's one of my favorite
[1:38:31] subjects I love talking about
[1:38:33] that and you know the whole argument
[1:38:36] that if if there's a God then why is
[1:38:38] there suffering and if there's and if he
[1:38:39] car either either he doesn't care or
[1:38:42] maybe he's evil himself to allow you
[1:38:44] know that's the whole demonic rant and
[1:38:49] Matt had seen too much Supernatural to
[1:38:52] just he couldn't let go that there is a
[1:38:54] real God I know I've seen him in my home
[1:38:56] my family my dad's Ministry and he had
[1:38:58] had experiences himself with the
[1:39:01] Lord so now there's this this battle and
[1:39:04] all I had to do all I had to do the Lord
[1:39:05] just told me what the problem was and I
[1:39:07] just had to go into the scriptures and
[1:39:09] start him at Genesis didn't we mat we
[1:39:10] started we just I just walked him
[1:39:12] through the Bible because I knew he
[1:39:13] believed it see I was already ahead cuz
[1:39:15] his mom and dad had raised him to
[1:39:17] believe this book so all I had to do my
[1:39:19] job was easy I just started going in
[1:39:20] Genesis and went right all the way
[1:39:21] through and showed him the sovereignty
[1:39:23] of God the plan of God election by
[1:39:25] origin brought him right down to the
[1:39:26] Book of Revelation and he he sat back in
[1:39:29] his chair as intellectual people often
[1:39:32] do and he said H that's very clear he
[1:39:34] said I've I've never realized it was so
[1:39:37] clear and that's that solved his
[1:39:40] problem
[1:39:42] here but the real crisis was at a deeper
[1:39:45] level and the Lord told me what the
[1:39:48] crisis was told told me what to say
[1:39:53] verbatim and said don't say this until
[1:39:57] the
[1:40:00] end so we're sitting there the
[1:40:03] intellectual part was really not hard
[1:40:06] because he believed this book all I had
[1:40:08] to do was prove it to him but now I knew
[1:40:11] there was something still in his heart
[1:40:14] and what it was is what the same problem
[1:40:17] we all had we had many experiences with
[1:40:20] God but we needed that certain something
[1:40:23] that certain something that once it
[1:40:25] happened there would never be you'd be
[1:40:28] sealed in and Satan sealed out and
[1:40:30] there'd be nothing could ever shake you
[1:40:32] you're not persuaded in it's a like
[1:40:34] brother brandham said it's a revelation
[1:40:36] of Jesus Christ personally to
[1:40:41] you so so funny because I knew what was
[1:40:44] gonna
[1:40:45] happen and he's still sitting there and
[1:40:48] I've answered his question and I said I
[1:40:50] said now Matt there's really another
[1:40:52] issue here oh yeah said you know you're
[1:40:57] you're
[1:40:58] struggling with with the message you're
[1:41:01] struggling you're you're taught to
[1:41:02] believe it you're trying to believe it
[1:41:04] you want to believe it but the devil has
[1:41:06] told you so many things in these four
[1:41:08] years have just decimated your faith can
[1:41:11] that happen I just confess to you it
[1:41:14] happened to me in that back office it
[1:41:16] can happen to
[1:41:17] you
[1:41:19] and and it and I mean it happened to
[1:41:22] John John in prison said send a message
[1:41:25] and ask Jesus are you he or do we look
[1:41:27] for another
[1:41:29] amen see so that's all that's all that's
[1:41:32] happening here's a here's a Son of God
[1:41:34] and the devil's got him in a in a in a
[1:41:36] in a whirlwind and I and I just said
[1:41:43] Matt I said
[1:41:46] look doctrinally speaking the message is
[1:41:49] simple to prove
[1:41:53] it's so scriptural it's easy I
[1:41:57] never worry about
[1:42:00] questions never worry about the Heathen
[1:42:02] raging the heathen's always going to
[1:42:03] rage determined unbelievers aren't going
[1:42:05] to believe anyway but if a gene of God
[1:42:07] is there they'll see it and that's a
[1:42:10] confidence I have but I said Matt there
[1:42:13] there's there's no need I you know
[1:42:14] you've been raised and and anything I
[1:42:17] could argue you doctrinally you already
[1:42:18] know anyway and it would just be
[1:42:20] rehearsal
[1:42:21] I said' now with the sovereignty thing
[1:42:22] you had never heard it put like that you
[1:42:24] told me and that once it had it
[1:42:27] explained like that then you got it see
[1:42:31] and I said but
[1:42:32] Matt you're more of a Believer than you
[1:42:36] realize you
[1:42:37] are this kid is looking at me like
[1:42:40] huh said oh yeah you're more of a
[1:42:43] Believer you're in fact is you're one of
[1:42:45] the most Believers around and I said
[1:42:49] because and here was my bomb I said
[1:42:54] you're in
[1:42:55] love with a product of this
[1:43:00] message there's a redheaded girl who you
[1:43:03] are crazy about and ready to
[1:43:06] marry and she is the manifestation of
[1:43:11] the message you're in doubt and I said
[1:43:14] the fact that you love her she's the
[1:43:17] manifested word is greater evidence than
[1:43:20] you believe the written
[1:43:22] word I had never personally
[1:43:27] seen I've I've I've I've had times where
[1:43:30] thank God it's not in a human but in in
[1:43:32] hunting I've seen the light go out they
[1:43:35] say the light goes out in your eyes I've
[1:43:36] seen that happened to animals and deer
[1:43:39] and and I put one down one time and I
[1:43:41] had only wounded it and I had to finish
[1:43:42] it quickly and I knew a next shot would
[1:43:45] finish it quickly and it didn't I
[1:43:46] watched the light first time I'd ever
[1:43:47] seen it in the woods light went out of
[1:43:48] its eyes and it was gone but I had never
[1:43:51] seen the light come on in someone's
[1:43:56] eyes and I'm looking at the face of a
[1:43:59] young man that I had been looking at
[1:44:01] since he was like that high and I
[1:44:04] literally watched the light turn on
[1:44:07] that's hard to explain but I watched I
[1:44:10] watched something happen in his soul
[1:44:14] that God had been waiting for that
[1:44:17] moment to do and he stood to his feet
[1:44:21] he looked at me and I could see already
[1:44:23] and he said you could have started with
[1:44:26] that and I said no I couldn't I said I
[1:44:30] was strictly told what the problem was
[1:44:33] what the answer was and I and God gave
[1:44:35] me a secret bomb that told me I can't
[1:44:37] use it till the
[1:44:41] end we hugged we cried we wept we prayed
[1:44:45] I let him go 10:00 that night his family
[1:44:48] can't find him sister Joanne's worried
[1:44:50] SI where's Matt I said well I don't know
[1:44:52] he left the church office and this last
[1:44:54] I saw him nobody could find him till he
[1:44:56] comes bursting in at home and sister
[1:44:59] Joanne testifies to this day she said I
[1:45:02] don't know what you said to him brother
[1:45:03] Jason she said but a different man came
[1:45:06] into my home that night and she said
[1:45:08] he's never been the same since that hour
[1:45:13] and I said Matt where did you go he said
[1:45:15] brother Jason he said I got in my car
[1:45:18] and he said I just started driving and
[1:45:20] he said
[1:45:21] I people probably thought I was insane
[1:45:22] because I was just sobbing and then I'd
[1:45:25] hysterically be laughing then I'd be
[1:45:27] sobbing then I'd be hysterically
[1:45:29] laughing and I'm driving sobbing and
[1:45:31] then I'm hysterically laughing he said I
[1:45:32] just had to drive down to the down to
[1:45:34] the pier down near Frip and he said I've
[1:45:37] been walking around there all night
