Father, Lord, we come before you, Lord, with our hearts open, Lord, that we could come together for this small this little Sunday school, Lord, that have a few thoughts, few notes put together, Lord. But if you could have something for the people through me, maybe encourage some people, encourage people here and online, whoever would be listening, they might be able to take something from it, draw strength from it to know where they stand and be able to move forward in your word. We ask these things in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. All right. Um, I want to read this morning, um, Ephesians chapter 6. And I'm continuing my thought. I I started, I guess last time I did Sunday school. Um, I think I titled the last one, um, the road to conquest. And I wanted to, as a subtitle today, I wanted to take the t the topic of um, so we want to read Ephesians chapter 6 and we'll start at verse 10. And it says um Ephesians chapter 6:10. It says, "Finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord, the power of his might. Put on the whole armor of God that you may be able to stand against the ws of the devil, not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places." Now, I want to again just sort of update your my point from last time, which is where it says, "For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, and against rulers of the darkness of this world." That is not saying we wrestle not period right it is an act he's Paul is indicating that we are actually actually legitimately in a real very real conflict it's a very real war it is in fact the most real war right like you know we think it's not an analogy to war if anything the physical wars and conflicts that we see around the world are an analogy to what's going right they are they that is the the natural reflection of what's truly going on in the spiritual world and so therefore We need to take this very seriously. We need to take it and sort of approach it and and much of what's going to apply to to real war and and real physical, you know, or to physical war and physical conflict is going anything else more so to your spiritual life and the way you approach your spiritual um spiritual battles. But u moving on, it says in verse 13, "Wherefore take on you the whole armor of God that you may be able to withstand in the evil day, having done all to stand. Stand therefore, having your lord's girth, and having on the breastplate of righteousness, and your feet shaw with the preparation of the gospel of peace, above all, taking the shield of faith, wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked, and take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the spirit, which is the word of God. Y'all can be seated. Um, so I want to take um see if this is on. Can y'all can you put my PowerPoint up, Ca? Brother Caleb, I'd appreciate that. Um, I want to take a moment and kind of focus in on verse 16 here where it says, "Above all, taking the shield of faith, wherewith you shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked." So, um, I have a picture up here. This is a a modern recreation of a Roman legionary, which would have been the sort of most common infantry soldier of the day in which this verse was written. Um, and I want you to notice that shield that he's got holding up. That is I think the the more the technical term for that type of shield is called a it's a big bulky sort of square silhouette shield. Um, and he can hide his entire body behind that thing &gt;&gt; just about. Right. And that shield is like the lynch pin for the entire Roman military. The Roman military. the the known world like everything that they ever set out to conquer they conquered pretty much. Um and that shield is basically the one of the key fundamental principles of it. Um because uh if this is going to work. It might not. Let me see if it Oh, it the clicker is dead. Um if you could advance that slide for me, brother. That is how the Romans deploy that shield. Okay. You don't just march out there with one guy and try to and you know you can do okay. But when you get a group of guys and they're all got their shields linked up like that of what's called the test formation. It's the Latin word for turtle, &gt;&gt; right? You get everybody linked up like that. You're not breaking through that, right? That is impenetrable. You can take fortresses that way because you can shoot arrows at them, but you're not going to hit anybody, right? they that the and what that requires in order to it requires a level of training, a level of discipline, but above all it requires a level of unity amongst your troops, right? Everybody in there has got to treat the guy next to them like their life depends on it because if it because it really does. Anybody goes down in that formation and now you have a giant gaping in your group that who knows what's going to come in there, right? you're going to everyone suffers when one person goes down. And so in order to do this, you have to have a spirit of unity and and of uniting amongst your people. And that truly actually if you study Roman culture and and their history, the recognition that each individual is weak on their own, but united they are strong. that philosophy ran up and down crossways up, you know, forward and backwards through Roman society. &gt;&gt; Everything in in, you know, as a Roman, you're you know, the the nation of Rome came first because because the group came first. You pri you you deprioritized yourself and your own individual because as long as you take care of the group, the group will take care of you, right? Rome came first. And so, you know, this is this is the whole the whole culture, uh, brother Kevin now. Um, could my the clicker There we go. So, this is sort of a drawing of a Roman magistrate. Um, I guess technically it' be a magistrate's guard, but um, either way, it but the indication that what I want to point you to is the thing he's holding, right? That is the Latin word for that is fascis. That is a it's obviously an axe, but it's got it's around the axe handle. You've got sticks that are all bound around it tightly because the the notion here and this was this the fascis was for the Roman magistrates. It was the symbol of the Roman magistrate's power. It was the symbol of his authority was the the symbolism here is that the each individual stick is easily broken. But when you bind it all together, no one can break that, right? I mean, even in the in the in the Bible, right? A three-fold cord is not easily broken. And when there's unity and so the the magistrate's power did not come from individual ability to do anything, but what it was speaking to is he was one individual in a whole system of Roman authority that yeah, you could oppose him, but you're not just opposing him. You're opposing the whole organization of the Roman Empire. And so this is where you know that is the core that's how Rome conquered the world &gt;&gt; right they I mean they just they they they were unstoppable because everybody was working in unison they had a a unity amongst um their society and when you have unity because you know unity no military is going to function &gt;&gt; right unity you have to have solidarity You have to have unity. Everybody has to be working in cooperation. The worst thing, like the most fatal thing to a military is infighting and dissension and disunityity, right? You break people's cooperation and they're done as it's over, right? Because now you're not fighting an army. You're fighting a group of individuals and each one can be picked off and nobody and and they don't care because you know who cares? He's just some other guy that I happen to be sharing a uniform with. But when you but when when that's your battle buddy and he goes down and now your life depends on it. Well, it's a whole different um uh mentality that you don't leave people behind. And and you know that's it's you know the every individual in the Roman military was seen as valuable. They weren't just uh that's that's why Caesar was able to take over as as the dictator because he treated his his soldiers like and they in turn treated Caesar like he was God. So you know this is you know this the idea of of unity and and and um never of of casting aside anything that would separate you from your from your group. That's how Rome conquered the world. [snorts] Um, and they didn't just conquer it in, you know, the classical era. They didn't conquer it thousands of years ago. If we could advance one more, that is the mace, US House of Representatives. I don't know if you can see that. It's kind of a small picture, but that is a fascis. It's not not like, you know, metaphorically. It is literally a fascis, you know, explicitly. The only difference is instead of an axe head sticking out of the top is a eagle with a globe, &gt;&gt; right? And so the and and if we could advance once more and there's probably the end of my slideshow. Oh, there we go. That's Abraham Lincoln. Now, you can't really see maybe you can in this picture, but under on his throne, under his hands are two fascis. They're you can't really see it. They're right here and right here if you you know you can find that picture and I' I've been to the Lincoln Memorial and you can see it really good there and that's what it is it's and you know Lincoln's whole presidency was the uniting of America right you had Civil War broke America and it was after stopped saying the United States are and started saying the United States is right it was before before the Civil War it was the United states are doing this, right? you say are you know a group of people are doing something but a group of people is that doesn't make any that's not grammarical but when you the the point there is after Lincoln is when the United States truly became bound together right Lincoln's famous for he's quoting scripture but he said a house divided cannot stand what happened under Lincoln the the American interpretation of the Supreme Court or of the US Constitution radically shifted after Lincoln because it completely see the Constitution and where the the sovereignty lies, right? It's not with the states, it's with the federal government and as one bound singular individual organization, not 50 separate organizations that happen to share a proximity, right? It's not the United States are we don't do that anymore. Is it's on your money. If anybody has a dollar in your pocket or a nickel in your pocket, pull it out. What does it say on there? E plubers unum right of one or one of many, right? One out of many. So here, you know, this the the Roman mentality of un die with a Roman Empire, &gt;&gt; right? The spirit of Rome has just kept on progressing, right? Every I think I'm done with the PowerPoint. Um uh thank you. Um all that it never quit. It never went away. It didn't stop. It's even to this day. It's just continued to progress. And now in the last day, we know that this that the spirit of the antichrist, the way would come to power was be as a great unifying force. Right? Now what's interesting is if you you know you study you study politics um uh you know you look at the political situation now one of the number one things that everybody seems to say whether they're left right independent whatever everybody says well the big problem facing America is the disunityity right everybody everybody's nobody can agree on anything so what's happening here is you have a spirit of disunityity amongst the people, right? People are are very um broken and scattered. And what that does is it starves people, right? If you want to if you want to feed someone poison hungry first and then they're not going to ask two questions about what you just fed them, right? If you break people up and you drive a wedge, drive wedge after wedge after wedge between the people, the minute somebody comes along with a unifying message, nobody's going to ask where the axe head is sticking out, right? All they want is to be unified. All they because everybody knows as long as everyone's got wedges between us, we're going to get broken. And so the same thing, so that's the antichrist spirit is to be a unifier. Um this is from um 1954 the mark of the beast. Uh this unites a time that church and state will unite together and Protestant and Catholic will throw their things together to fight communism. And it's exactly playing in the hands of what God said right here. And you Protestants laying yonder, sound asleep, reading a love story magazine instead of your Bible, out gatting around somewhere to some kind of a part in prayer meeting somewhere or fussing at one another about little old petty things that don't matter that much. You ought to be on your knees somewhere if you know what eternity meant. And so here's I and I guess I want to, you know, make a a point here. If this is world right the whole world is driving towards this great unifying right then doesn't that sort of you know doesn't that tell us that if the if Satan's plan for the world is always so close to the real thing that it would deceive the very elect if it were possible if that's the also imply that the the plan of God is also to unify his people right you know when Paul's saying take up the shield of faith What he's saying, he's not just saying you as an individual take up your shield of faith. What he's saying is employ the tactics of the Roman legion as a spiritual tactic. Don't just go face it with your brothers and sisters with your shields locked. &gt;&gt; Don't just go make sure you have a united church, a church family that you're fighting with or or not fighting against, but um on the same side as, right? be be a united fighting force because if you don't, you're going to get you're going to get isolated and and and and God in your church, gossip about your brother, &gt;&gt; say something negative about your sister, &gt;&gt; you know, if you want to if you want to look look in the at the Tower of Babel I think it's Genesis chapter 13. They were they were had one unified all operating with a united people and God said he couldn't withhold what they wanted when they were united. That's sinful fallen people and God couldn't stop them until he broke their unity. Okay. If that's the case, how much more so when when God's people come together with the same level of unity, that's why you get them at the day of on the day of Pentecost in one mind and one accord, you get this spectacular move of the spirit. And the key there is the unity of the people, right? If you want to if you want to if you want to absolutely kill the move of the spirit in your church, [crying] start bickering about people. &gt;&gt; Start getting an attitude about your brother or your sister. Start finding fault with everything in the everyone in the church, &gt;&gt; right? start start you know really focusing in on the you know the faults and failures of the people that you share a pew with &gt;&gt; you do that and you will absolutely of the spirit in your church &gt;&gt; it will be you you you won't I mean look when there's when there's that level a certain level of of um distrust amongst the people around you that you share a church with when you're not going out of your way to build those connections to build a heart connection with the if you're not doing that and you can't and there's there's no heart um you know there's no u there's no love in the church right and it's not you know there's there's a certain kind of love where like yes yes you know we we share a church and I love them very much but I certainly wouldn't do anything for them you know I certainly wouldn't go out of my way to help you know it's just you know there there's got to be some you got to put some wheels on your on your love, you got to put some wheels on on to that. You got to go make it active for it to mean anything. But when you do that and now everyone's got, you know, in one, that's when the spirit can operate. If you don't, if you just if it's you pay lip service to unity, you pay lip service to to your brothers and sisters and and and um you know, the needs in the church, then you know, you share a but you don't really share a common cause, right? You're not you're not really you're all just kind of standing around looking in the same direction. You're not really united. You're not you're not your shield of faith isn't covering your brother. You know, when you if your shield of faith is covering your brother, that means that when he has a failure, you stand in the cover that &gt;&gt; you know, help my brother. &gt;&gt; You don't, oh Lord, let me kick him out of the group. He's a liability. &gt;&gt; No, you don't do that. &gt;&gt; You lift him up when he goes down. You grab him and pick him back up because as much as he needs you, you need him. &gt;&gt; When your brother falls, you don't kick him to the curb. so he can stand and and defend you when you fall. &gt;&gt; Right? No one's going to be perfect. I'm not going to be perfect. You're not going to be perfect. We're all going to make a cataclysmic mistakes. We're all going to be lying flat on our back at some point and desperately need the grace of God in our life at some point. And it's going to be the people around you help you back to your feet that you're going to depend upon. And if if you have a whole church that nobody's willing to do that, the people go down and they don't come back up. Amen. &gt;&gt; Right. So, that's where we need to be. We need to be united. We need to uh we need to have it's not like I said, it's not just taking on the shield of faith. It's it's taking on the shield of faith and using it using it in the in in in a united fashion. And that's when it becomes really truly powerful. [snorts] We look at the in Matthew chapter 13. Um the parable of the tears. Um I'm sorry. Uh the Tower of Babel is not Genesis 13. It's Genesis 11. But the parable of the tears in Matthew 13 24-30. And I'm sure we're all familiar with it. I'm not going to take the time to read it. Um well, I guess we can. um put he forth unto them, saying, "The kingdom of heaven is likened unto a man which swed good seed in his field." Um and while a man slept, his enemy came and swed tears among the wheat and um went his way. When the blade was sprung up and brought forth fruit, then appeared the tears also. So the ser uh householder came and said unto him, "Sir, did uh not thou sow good seed in thy field? from whence then hath it tears? Said unto them, an enemy hath done this. The servant said unto him, Wilt thou then that we go and gather them up? But he said, Nay, lest while you gather root up also the wheat with them. Let both grow together until the harvest. And in the time of harvest, I will say to the reapers, gather ye together first the tears, and bind them in bundles to gather the wheat unto my barn. So here we have at the end. So this is a parable of the end time, right? This is when when when the, you know, we're separating the the the sheep and the goats, so to speak. It's going to require a binding together. It's going to require a uniting, a gathering together that there's going to it would require a spirit. Don't be don't be mystified when you see the church world uniting and everyone coming together because that's the binding of the tears. Of course they have to gather together. Of course they have to group together. If they didn't, then you're going to have them interspersed with the wheat and the tears together, right? But it's going to require and so and at the same time that the tears are being bound together, so is the wheat. &gt;&gt; At the end, there has to be a pulling together and a uniting together. Um Benjamin Franklin's famous for saying that, you know, after they signed the Declaration of Independence, he said, "Gentlemen, we must all hang together or most assuredly we will all hang separately." &gt;&gt; Right? Um if you don't with your fellow Christians, you will be bound. &gt;&gt; You're going to be bound one way or the other. You either get bound together with your fellow Christians or your fellow believers, or you'll be bound with the the tears. But you're you're not going to get away from some sort of being bound, right? You're going to be in one group or the other. Oh, that's why you gather together even more so as you see the day approaching. You know, do your utmost to to fight to have common ground with your with the people you share a church with, right? If you, you know, look expects every single group of people to never have a disagreement or a misunderstanding or um conflict or I don't know, just clashes of personality. We're all different people. We have come different personalities and it's supposed to be that way. You're not necessarily going to get along with everybody off the bat. You have an obligation to fight to figure out how to do so, right? do and it's you're not fighting them, you're fighting the devil who's trying to drive a wedge between you. &gt;&gt; Find a way to bind together with the people, even the people that you just really can't stand. Work even harder to be friends with them, right? Because because that's what's going to bring you want you want to rushing mighty wind move through your church, do that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Right? Find a way to lay aside your petty differences. &gt;&gt; So what if they disagree with you on something? &gt;&gt; So what if they disagree with you on some point of doctrine? get the right spirit and the doctrinal stuff will work itself out. &gt;&gt; Okay. Um I've got to wrap up here, but I I do want to make one final point. Um, and maybe this is what I'll I'll maybe touch on this next time, but um, [crying] one of the things that, you know, you look at the sort of the the the world today, like you say, in this era of of unifying, one of the major and I mentioned, you know, there would be a spirit of division in the land so that the spir when the spir when a a spirit of false unity would come, it would it would be appealing to people. If you're following politics, especially sort of like the really bleeding edge of politics, the stuff that you don't really necessarily see stuff that's going on sort of in the in the u on the fringes, the stuff that's going to become policy in five years, but no one's ever heard of right now. Um what you see on out there is amongst young people especially the absolute resentment that you have of young people young men 30 18 to 30 years old towards older generations is mindboggling. I don't think there's ever been a period in in human history in which the younger generations had this level of resentment towards the older generations. It is mindblowing how extreme it is. And in that environment, you when this when that's the that's the stage for for for the final, you know, chapter of the world, right? like the the final chap, you know, the the grand finale of um of history is one in which there's such intergenerational resentment and bitterness. I cannot separate from that the idea the the the the fact that the prophecy of Malachi 4 that would be the prophet for this day was specifically addressing iting the hearts of children and fathers &gt;&gt; that parents and and that specifically Malachi 4 that we hang our entire everything on that prophecy was specifically addressing returning hearts of children to fathers and fathers of children and in this day and age intergenerational bitterness is so extreme I cannot uh separate those two I I just can't when So look, if you are in the older generation, it is if you really want to fulfill the message of Malachi 4, find a way to build bridges to the young people. Find a way. That is, I mean, that's the message of Malachi 4 right there. Put it in a I mean, literally. And likewise, if you're a young person, find a way to build bridges to the older generations. That's how you fulfill the prophecy of Malachi 4 in a real practical sense, &gt;&gt; right? Not to say say that, you know, obviously there was William Brandon who fulfilled the prophecy. If you want to carry that message, if you want to play that prophecy for the age out, find a way to do that because that's the spirit of what you what you're dealing with is disunityity and specifically of intergenerational um uh disunityity, right? And I'll I'll I'll read um and I'm going to reread this. This is something I read previously. This is from a message called oneness in 1962. Now the first man and first woman in the garden of Eden was in perfect harmony with God. So much that God could come down at any time he desired and talk lip to ear with Adam and Eve. Now that is perfect oneness. God and his creation. God speaking. And they were so perfect in harmony with God till they were one with God. God and his family was one. And this is what I want to highlight. any man and his family, a correct, good, noble, obedient family is one with another. Any family. And if there's something in the family that moves them apart, the family's broken somewhere. They should all be one. Father with mother, mother with father, children with parents, parents with children, all in agreement. Okay. So, I will finish with that. Let's stand and have a word of prayer. Father, Lord, we come before you this for the word that you've given us and the opportunity that we have to meet together in this place. ask that you would be mindful of us and the as we progress through the service as the worship service would commence that the people would be able to cast aside any of the burdens of the world, the burdens of their mind and focus solely on you and worship of your holy name and you'd be pleased to come down and dwell with us and walk amongst us and impart us you unto us the word of life through the preaching of the word. We ask these things in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; [music]
