[32:14] We had a wonderful time. I say we, me
[32:17] and the Lord.
[32:18] I left such sweetheart here. And um but
[32:22] me and the Lord went to Florida and we
[32:24] had a wonderful time with brother Jack
[32:26] as I'm sure you can imagine. Uh then we
[32:29] got to go over to the Haitian church, be
[32:32] with brother Luis Jean there. My
[32:34] goodness, what a wow. I love I wish I
[32:37] kept thinking I wish I had the whole
[32:39] church. I wish I had everybody here. The
[32:42] uh it's it's all it's like you've left
[32:44] uh and went into a different world. It's
[32:46] um that's the only way I know how to
[32:48] describe it. Those Haitian believers,
[32:50] they are just full of zeal and my
[32:55] goodness, they they worship and they
[32:57] sing. And I was I was sitting there
[32:58] thinking, "Wow, if Brother Anthony was
[33:00] here, this place would just go crazy."
[33:02] because they had Jack there and and then
[33:05] we'd have Anthony there and then they
[33:06] have another brother there who I had
[33:08] never met and uh my goodness I I I just
[33:12] thought they'd make a trio unstoppable.
[33:15] But uh we had such a such a wonderful
[33:17] time and I ministered there and couple
[33:20] of services Saturday and Sunday for
[33:21] brother Jack in West Palm and then
[33:24] across to Boon Beach about 25 minutes
[33:27] away there to be with brother um Luis.
[33:31] I'd been there once before, but it had
[33:33] been quite a little while. So, uh, we
[33:36] were looking for the Lord, and he didn't
[33:38] disappoint. The Lord never disappoints.
[33:40] Praise God. Going to invite you to the,
[33:42] uh, scripture this evening. I want to
[33:44] take a, a title, uh, get in. Sorry, I
[33:47] didn't get it to you. I want to take a
[33:48] title, the living word. And, um, want to
[33:52] invite you to Matthew chapter 3.
[33:56] Amen. You love him. Amen.
[33:59] My it's just a wonderful when you when
[34:02] you sit back and realize how God moves
[34:05] and
[34:07] and and sometimes you try to stay a
[34:09] breast of it and you just you you you
[34:11] suddenly look around and go, Lord,
[34:13] you've been busier than I would have
[34:14] ever imagined.
[34:16] So, you know, we're we're just trusting
[34:18] him uh this evening. Amen. Praise the
[34:21] Lord. So, um um
[34:25] no, no, no, no. I'm sorry. John chapter
[34:27] 1, not Matthew chapter 3. Uh, my mind is
[34:30] on another sermon. Amen. Praise the
[34:32] Lord. John chapter 1. Yes. Now, we had
[34:39] we had read over some of this, I think,
[34:41] the last time I was ministering
[34:44] uh here. And um and I and I I didn't get
[34:49] to continue uh everything that was on my
[34:51] heart. I I got to everything that the
[34:53] Lord wanted for that service, but I
[34:55] didn't get to go all the way to my
[34:58] heart's desire. So, we're going to do
[35:00] that tonight. Brother Jack, good to see
[35:01] you and Sister Kathy out here. Uh I got
[35:04] half of mine to let you give that
[35:05] testimony tonight, but you'd almost need
[35:07] the whole service.
[35:10] Amen. Brother Jack is uh got a testimony
[35:13] that'll blow your mind. And uh we I
[35:16] might I might I might cut it off early,
[35:18] Brother Jack, and give you a chance.
[35:19] We'll see how the anointing of the Lord
[35:22] goes um on that. All right. So, St. John
[35:26] chapter 1
[35:28] and I want to read um from verse 35.
[35:35] Amen. You have it? Say amen.
[35:38] Amen.
[35:40] Again,
[35:42] the next day after John stood and two of
[35:44] his disciples and looked upon Jesus as
[35:47] he walked, he saith, "Behold the lamb of
[35:50] God." And the two disciples heard him
[35:54] speak, and they followed Jesus. Then
[35:57] Jesus turned and saw them following, and
[36:00] saith unto them, "What seek ye?" They
[36:03] said unto him, "Rabbi," which is to say,
[36:05] being interpreted, "Master, where
[36:07] dwellest thou?" He saith unto them,
[36:10] "Come and see." They came and saw where
[36:13] he dwelt, and abodeed with him that day,
[36:16] for it was about the 10th hour. Amen.
[36:19] Let's pray. Father, we com we commit
[36:22] ourselves now into your hands, Lord. And
[36:25] you see the burden of the word that's
[36:27] upon my heart, Master, and how you've
[36:30] moved strangely, Lord, for me to be
[36:33] standing here to preach this sermon
[36:35] tonight. And Father, events that
[36:38] happened earlier, Lord, uh inform my
[36:41] thinking, Father, that you've been busy
[36:43] since early this morning, Lord, and
[36:45] moving to this moment. Now, I pray
[36:47] you'll capture our hearts and our minds,
[36:50] Lord, and focus us on your word as we
[36:53] are completely positive. We have your
[36:56] mind for your direction now. Commit it
[36:57] to you and commit myself into your hands
[37:00] in Jesus' name. Amen. You can be seated,
[37:03] friends. Now, you'll recognize if you
[37:06] heard
[37:07] um my previous sermon, we we talked
[37:10] about this where uh we actually started
[37:13] quite a bit before where Jesus, you
[37:17] know, was coming and John said, "Behold
[37:20] the lamb of God that takes away the sin
[37:22] of the world." And we made a reference
[37:25] how that if you'll remember that John
[37:28] actually said that two or three times.
[37:31] And so it was pretty incredible
[37:34] uh when John ends up in in prison and
[37:38] his eagle eyes get filmed over and he
[37:40] says, you know, he sends his own
[37:42] disciples to say, "Can you go ask him,
[37:46] are you he or do we look for another?"
[37:49] And that that I you know if you remember
[37:51] in our last time in our last lesson it
[37:53] was shocking because he was so
[37:56] absolutely positive that when he saw him
[37:59] when he was looking at him there was no
[38:01] question you know when he was in when he
[38:04] was in church there was no question when
[38:05] he's surrounded by his brothers there's
[38:07] no question when the anointing was
[38:09] falling there's no question but then
[38:11] you're not at church you're not around
[38:14] the brothers and sisters the anointing
[38:16] you don't feel all that much and now
[38:18] you're what what what you thought you
[38:20] were seeing at at first. Now, maybe
[38:22] you're not quite so sure. And so, we
[38:25] found that it could happen to John, it
[38:27] could happen to the best of us because
[38:29] there is never a man born of a woman
[38:31] greater than John except uh those least
[38:34] in the kingdom. And so, so we find that
[38:37] it was pretty incredible statement and
[38:39] it and it and it really comes down to uh
[38:43] my thought that I wanted to kind of
[38:45] carry on and I I and even even as I
[38:48] would carry on with it tonight, normally
[38:50] I already know the Lord is moving me uh
[38:53] to to go into some different areas. So
[38:55] now when I take this sermon, I want to
[38:58] take this title tonight uh the living
[39:00] word. And it incidentally that's the
[39:02] exact title I took for Saturday night uh
[39:05] in West Palm Beach. However, I'm not
[39:07] preaching that sermon. So if you go
[39:09] online at brother Jack's church and you
[39:11] hear that sermon, you're going to go,
[39:12] "Wait, what happened?" Uh but you're
[39:14] just going to have to trust me. I'm
[39:16] being led of the Holy Spirit. So we find
[39:19] that the emphasis that I want to bring
[39:21] to you tonight is this term come and
[39:25] see. Now that that goes back to what we
[39:30] were saying that as long as John could
[39:32] see something as long as he could
[39:35] experience something. So there's
[39:36] something to be said about an
[39:39] experience.
[39:40] There's something to be said about uh
[39:44] having the word on display. I'm here to
[39:46] tell you something friends. It is tre of
[39:48] tremendous importance. Uh, brother
[39:51] Connie, is that you? Praise the Lord.
[39:53] Sister Moa, praise God. Happy to have
[39:55] you. I got a message from Sisterh
[39:57] Suzanne for you. Sister Mo, so don't
[39:58] don't forget it. Happy to have them from
[40:00] Switzerland here. Stand up so everybody
[40:02] can stare at you real quick. Amen. Come
[40:03] on, Sister Mo. Stand up. All right.
[40:05] Sweden. Yeah, Sweden. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
[40:08] Praise the Lord. From Sweden. Yeah.
[40:10] Let's get that straight.
[40:12] Happy to have them here. So, journeying
[40:14] with us for a little while. You're in
[40:15] for a few weeks. Okay. Yeah, good deal.
[40:18] So, I've been trying to figure out how
[40:20] we could put him to work at the camp.
[40:21] So, we'll have to talk to the team about
[40:22] that. But I I want to really now come in
[40:26] on this idea of a living word because
[40:29] I'm going to tell you something,
[40:30] friends. The word of God in all of its
[40:33] value, you know, has its has its
[40:36] greatest impact when it's actually on
[40:39] display. You remember the that Paul
[40:41] taught us that the letter actually
[40:43] kills. But it's the spirit that gives
[40:46] life. Now, if this body doesn't have a
[40:48] spirit in it, it's it's it's not
[40:50] animated. It lays down. And and there's
[40:52] really nothing that that my body without
[40:56] its spirit, there's nothing it can do
[40:57] for you. See? And so if I'm going to
[41:00] give you any help at all, I need to have
[41:02] the spirit of life in me animating my
[41:05] body and speaking through my body and
[41:07] and giving you the words of life. That's
[41:09] how I can benefit you tonight. So it's
[41:12] better for you if I'm a living word.
[41:15] Amen.
[41:16] See, now we'll go another step. Now
[41:19] we're going to say more than just a
[41:22] living human taking a written word into
[41:25] a brain, you know, going through the
[41:27] reasoning, coming out sending air over
[41:29] the vocal cords and now just preaching
[41:32] the word. So now it's off the page and
[41:34] now it's it's words you're coming that
[41:37] that you're hearing come. But now what
[41:40] what's a better way than that is if
[41:42] actually my life is actually these these
[41:46] words
[41:47] and I might not even need to say any
[41:50] actual words
[41:52] or read you any actual words.
[41:56] Right? So, so when he says to them,
[41:59] "Come and see." This is exactly what's
[42:02] been going on the whole time. John has
[42:05] been seeing him. The disciples have been
[42:07] seeing him. The he said said to the
[42:09] people, "This is he." And so now the
[42:12] people are seeing him. I'm trying to
[42:13] move this away because it keeps keeps
[42:15] popping. Excuse me.
[42:17] And so now the people are seeing him.
[42:19] And this is what's having the greatest
[42:21] effect. The absence of that is what I
[42:24] was emphasizing when John no longer sees
[42:27] that.
[42:30] Amen.
[42:31] So now, how important is it for you in
[42:35] your homes or in this church or as
[42:38] fellowship one among another for your
[42:41] brothers and sisters to see the word on
[42:43] display? What about your children? What
[42:44] about your neighbors? What about your
[42:46] where you work?
[42:48] What about in the school? What about in
[42:49] the market? You will never be a more
[42:52] powerful witness than when when when you
[42:56] can actually
[42:58] can say to the people they say what do
[43:00] you believe
[43:02] and you can say come and see
[43:06] come and see not even come and hear
[43:10] but come and see
[43:13] I'm here to tell you something friends
[43:15] God has so ordained prophecy at the last
[43:20] day that the thing that is going to the
[43:24] world is a visible living word. Amen.
[43:29] And in fact is if you're going to do
[43:31] this world any good or your loved ones
[43:33] any good, I'm here to tell you the
[43:35] greatest point where you're going to be
[43:37] obeying the commission is when your
[43:40] spouse can see the word. Your children
[43:42] can see the word. Your congregation can
[43:45] see the word.
[43:47] Your family can see the word.
[43:49] That's right. Amen.
[43:52] It's not lost on me that this is exactly
[43:57] when John in the book of Revelation
[44:00] and he comes into chapter six and the
[44:03] very first seal is going to be opened
[44:07] and he says, you know, one of the living
[44:10] creatures said, I saw when he opened one
[44:12] of the first seal and it begins to
[44:14] describe how he sees a white horse go
[44:16] forward and and that's what he sees and
[44:18] and a and the voice of the of of the
[44:22] beast says to him, "Come and see."
[44:25] Yes. Amen.
[44:26] You'll find it when you keep going on
[44:28] through all four of those first four
[44:30] seals, which are the relevant seals to
[44:32] us because the fourth seal is the time
[44:35] where the seventh sealed mysteries
[44:36] unfolded. And and that's the time the
[44:38] bride goes in a rapture. That's the
[44:40] eagle anointing.
[44:41] Amen.
[44:41] Amen. And so from the first seal to the
[44:45] second seal to the third seal to the
[44:47] fourth seal to the entire church age,
[44:50] here's the message. Come and see.
[44:54] Not come and go to school. Not come and
[44:57] get a theology degree. Not come and
[44:59] memorize.
[45:02] See, not come and have a form, but
[45:04] actually come and see the word. John was
[45:08] invited. You need to come and see this.
[45:11] John.
[45:13] This is going to be the angle that God
[45:16] is going to use down through the ages.
[45:19] He's going to be on display. This why
[45:22] Paul would talk about the letter kleth,
[45:24] the spirit giveth life. John Paul knew
[45:28] that if it's only a letter and now
[45:30] listen
[45:32] when I look at this Bible I'm glad that
[45:34] it had apostles and prophets that wrote
[45:37] it
[45:38] because there's things that are said in
[45:40] here that I would never have the courage
[45:44] to say. I would never have the courage
[45:47] to say to you. You know the the letter
[45:50] kill you will kill you. Yeah,
[45:53] but I can say it because Paul said it.
[45:56] And I can say, "Okay, we're good." The
[45:58] latter will kill you.
[46:01] Say, "Wow, but I thought it's the word
[46:03] of God." Sure, friends, but if you
[46:05] listen, every I I've made this statement
[46:08] before for years.
[46:10] You come to the house of God where the
[46:13] fresh kill of the word is. It is the
[46:15] most glorious place and the most deadly
[46:18] place
[46:19] you can be simultaneously
[46:22] because it's the place of life and death
[46:24] because that's where God took Israel in
[46:27] the Old Testament and he took this many
[46:29] priests and he stuck them on Mount
[46:30] Gerism and he took this many priests and
[46:33] stuck them on Mount Ebal and he made all
[46:35] the millions of people walk but in the
[46:37] valley between the two mountains and on
[46:39] this mountain these priests shouted the
[46:41] blessings and the glories and the
[46:42] promises of God. All they had to do is
[46:45] keep the word and go forward. And on
[46:47] this mountain over here, the other
[46:48] priest shouted, "Cursings and death and
[46:50] destruction. If you break it and God
[46:52] will destroy you." And and they
[46:53] literally had to walk through the valley
[46:56] and hear the blessings and the cursings.
[46:59] Hear the promises and the warnings at
[47:02] the same time. And whichever one,
[47:04] whichever one that they allowed to
[47:06] affect their life, that's the end they
[47:08] got. And I'm here to tell you, they got
[47:11] their own end.
[47:12] Amen.
[47:14] As I as I've said, Chris and I were uh
[47:16] on our walk this morning and we were
[47:18] talking about that very thing. How that,
[47:20] you know, God is not some evil, you
[47:23] know, illtempered, you know, wake up on
[47:26] the wrong side of the bed deity that's
[47:29] going to burn the world. You know,
[47:30] they've hurt his feelings, so he's going
[47:32] to burn them in a tribulation. That's
[47:34] not God.
[47:35] God is simply, he cries out to man and
[47:38] has cried out to man for millennia. You
[47:40] know, why will you die? you know, why
[47:42] will you not come to me and live? I I
[47:44] don't I don't value the death of anyone,
[47:46] not even the sinner.
[47:48] And but but when we come back to it, we
[47:50] find that Jesus goes back and quotes the
[47:52] Old Testament prophet saying their eyes
[47:56] they have closed.
[47:59] Lest the glorious light should shine to
[48:01] them and they should believe and be
[48:03] converted and I should heal them.
[48:05] See, so their eyes they have closed. So,
[48:08] you know, the fact of the matter is God
[48:09] is not going to destroy the world. He
[48:11] doesn't God loves the world. He's not
[48:13] going to annihilate this world. He's
[48:14] simply going to pull out the stops and
[48:17] man is going to annihilate himself.
[48:19] He's going to take the bride home. And
[48:21] when the bride leaves, the blood leaves
[48:22] and then grace is over. And then there's
[48:24] nothing left for the Gentiles. Then the
[48:26] then the blood ring is gone.
[48:30] The blood ring is gone. And now the now
[48:32] God actually sees. He's not looking at
[48:34] red through red. He's looking straight
[48:36] at red sin and then the tribulation.
[48:38] What else is he going to do but pour out
[48:40] the tribulation period?
[48:42] I'm here to tell you something, friends.
[48:43] If there was ever a time for the living
[48:45] word to be on display in our lives, it's
[48:49] got to be right now.
[48:51] Hallelujah.
[48:52] Amen. Amen.
[48:57] Brother Brandon makes some
[48:59] astonishing statements and I just want
[49:03] to perhaps catch two of them. Uh one of
[49:06] them in the second seal
[49:09] and this is this has been so much on my
[49:12] heart and mind for days and talking to
[49:16] another minister about it actually early
[49:18] this morning
[49:20] and and making some comments back and
[49:22] forth. That's why it was still on my
[49:24] heart when uh Chris and I, of course, we
[49:26] do that anyway. We preach to each other
[49:28] on our walk. I don't know how we get any
[49:29] walking done. We preach to each other
[49:31] the whole time. But I love the word and
[49:34] I love people who love the word.
[49:36] Amen.
[49:36] Want to talk about the word. And so now,
[49:41] Brother Brandon makes this statement. I'
[49:43] I've struggled which one to read first.
[49:45] And let me just I'm going to read you
[49:46] this one because I want to set my
[49:49] thought in your heart and kind of
[49:50] augment what I've said to this point.
[49:54] So we I'm pretty sure that I went into
[49:58] the word incarnation here uh last time
[50:01] or the time before I even if I didn't
[50:03] it's not important. Incarnation is um is
[50:06] the is the embodiment of a deity in in
[50:09] flesh.
[50:09] Yeah.
[50:10] That's incarnation. And it's either it
[50:13] it can and in fact is the the definition
[50:16] says the a deity embodied either in
[50:19] human flesh and when it's capitalized
[50:21] it's God Almighty in incarnate in the
[50:26] Lord Jesus Christ but just generally
[50:29] speaking it is a deity uh who has taken
[50:33] up form taken up and is now expressing
[50:36] himself in the form of flesh of a human
[50:39] or an animal. And that's an interesting
[50:42] little tail end of that. It's it's or an
[50:44] animal. And that makes perfect sense to
[50:46] me because if you think about that, but
[50:50] you're going to see here in this quote
[50:51] in a minute where brother Brandham talks
[50:53] about Satan incarnating himself and he's
[50:57] in in a in Revelation symbolism, he's
[51:00] incarnating himself as a beast.
[51:04] Amen.
[51:05] But in reality form, it's in human
[51:08] beings.
[51:10] Now watch. Second seal.
[51:13] Satan is going has incarnated himself.
[51:16] Now I don't remember if I read this. If
[51:18] I have, I'm going to read it again.
[51:19] Anyway,
[51:22] Satan has incarnated himself
[51:25] from antichrist to false prophet. And he
[51:29] starts talking about down through the
[51:30] ages in the days of the Jew and is
[51:32] antichrist and is among the early
[51:34] church. see in the early church and then
[51:36] in the dark ages and then he become a
[51:38] false prophet and you know your your
[51:41] Bible he the fourth age they crowned him
[51:43] as a false prophet. Remember it started
[51:44] out as just a saying and then it became
[51:46] a doctrine and then it became an actual
[51:49] person and they crowned him as a false
[51:50] prophet. And so, so we find then, but
[51:53] but we also know that that false prophet
[51:57] has demons in him that are just
[52:00] placeholders until Satan himself comes.
[52:03] Which he's not coming down to incarnate
[52:06] the false prophet until the bride goes
[52:08] up.
[52:10] Now, here's where brother Brandham is
[52:11] teaching that second seal. So, he says,
[52:14] now you've got the early church and
[52:16] you've got the dark ages. He become a
[52:17] false prophet to the world. See here
[52:20] with and this is so strong with her cup
[52:22] of iniquity.
[52:24] Now now that's to the church age. Now
[52:27] but in the age after the church goes
[52:30] home. So the brideg goes up. Satan comes
[52:33] down in the age after the church goes
[52:36] home. He becomes a beast. He becomes the
[52:42] devil incarnate. The red dragon himself.
[52:46] He says, "Can you see what I mean? He is
[52:48] incarnate in his people then. So now
[52:51] this is Lucifer personified.
[52:54] Yeah. Amen.
[52:55] He's incarnate in people.
[52:57] Yeah.
[52:58] Now catch it. You say, "I thought I
[53:01] thought only God could be inside of
[53:04] people." Multiple. I thought only God
[53:07] could divide himself into his church.
[53:09] How can one how can one, you know,
[53:12] former archangel divide himself into all
[53:15] the people of the world? You're going to
[53:16] find out. Watch this.
[53:19] He says, he says he becomes a beast. He
[53:22] becomes a devil incarnate. Can't you see
[53:24] what I mean? He is incarnate in his
[53:25] people. Then he's got his people bound
[53:28] by his power. The false prophet has,
[53:32] this is a big point. The false prophet
[53:36] has prophesied them right into it.
[53:40] See, give them over to strong delusions.
[53:44] This is what we're talking about today,
[53:45] Chris. strong delusions to believe a lie
[53:49] and be damned by it, denying the word
[53:52] with a form of godliness.
[53:55] See, so now so now you're you're
[53:58] catching something here that he has
[54:01] prophesied them into it. So it's it's
[54:04] it's not it's not the the same. He has
[54:07] no power of creation. But watch what he
[54:09] does have. His power is is the
[54:12] controlling influence over human beings
[54:17] who were born with free agency
[54:20] who don't have it anymore.
[54:25] You understand that people run away from
[54:29] Christ saying, "I want to be free." And
[54:33] they don't realize they're headed right
[54:36] to bondage. The only one who will make
[54:39] you free is the son.
[54:42] He's the only form of freedom there is.
[54:46] Because now when you have the son living
[54:48] inside you, like brother Jason said that
[54:50] time, now now you actually are able to
[54:54] live the kind of life God designed you
[54:56] for
[54:58] as a son of God. And you're free to live
[55:01] that. And you can do it cuz you want to.
[55:04] Amen.
[55:05] Amen.
[55:07] Oh my. Whom the son is made free. If you
[55:11] don't know the Lord Jesus Christ
[55:12] tonight, let me blow a freedom trumpet.
[55:15] Let me blow a jubilee trumpet. You can
[55:18] be free tonight
[55:21] to live after the image of God's word to
[55:23] become yourself,
[55:26] the living word. Amen.
[55:32] See, the false prophet has prophesied
[55:34] them right into it. So, how did how did
[55:37] you get how did you become the word?
[55:41] Did a did did God wave a magic wand over
[55:44] your head?
[55:45] [Music]
[55:47] Did Did somebody sprinkle pixie dust
[55:50] over you?
[55:52] No. God sent not a false prophet, but a
[55:56] true prophet. and he has prophesied you
[55:59] right into it.
[56:03] Say, "What do you mean prophesying?"
[56:04] Preaching. That's the That's the term
[56:06] prophesying. Prophesy to preachers.
[56:08] Prophesying is one of the gifts in the
[56:10] church, the gift of prophecy. And it's
[56:12] amazing that you have movements today
[56:14] wanting to take away the gift of
[56:15] prophecy
[56:16] and they just want you to take an
[56:18] electronic device and push play.
[56:20] Nonsense. You need prophesying, too. You
[56:23] need the word to come forth. It
[56:25] transforms your life.
[56:27] Hallelujah, friends. It's it's the most
[56:30] powerful weapon in the world.
[56:33] It's God's word
[56:34] if it's believed.
[56:37] Now, it's not just to you because the
[56:39] whole m remember the thing is the living
[56:41] word. So, it's come and see. So, now the
[56:44] whole the whole world should should be
[56:47] able to hear that from us. Come and see.
[56:50] Amen. See, so now it goes into you to go
[56:55] out further. And that's why brother
[56:57] Brandon would say any any son or
[56:59] daughter of God who takes the word of
[57:01] God with faith now with faith
[57:04] and places it upon their lips. Brother
[57:06] Brandham says that's the same as deity
[57:09] speaking.
[57:11] See, because why? You've been preached
[57:13] right into it. You've been fed the diet
[57:16] of the word until you've become the word
[57:18] because you are what you eat. This is
[57:20] why we have to watch what what this
[57:23] leotal world offers us. We have to think
[57:25] about what our eyes look at and our ears
[57:27] here and our our and our life connects
[57:30] to and our activities and places we go.
[57:33] I'm here to tell you say it doesn't
[57:34] matter. Oh, it matters.
[57:36] Oh, it matters. I'm here to tell you it
[57:38] matters a lot.
[57:42] See,
[57:45] so he says he has become the beast. He's
[57:47] become the devil incarnate. the false
[57:49] prophet has prophesied them right into
[57:50] it. Give them over to strong delusions
[57:53] to believe a lie. God, he says, now God
[57:55] works his place in a trinity. See,
[57:57] here's here's the beauty of the trinity.
[58:00] And this is why, you know, I said to the
[58:03] to our noble, highly esteemed, you know,
[58:07] mega church radio preacher who won't
[58:09] sell airtime to anyone else and and
[58:13] declared to the whole community
[58:15] erroneously, by the way, that William
[58:17] Brandham didn't believe in the Trinity.
[58:19] And I, it's more than I could take,
[58:21] brother Joe. I called him up and I said,
[58:23] "Who told you William Brandham didn't
[58:24] believe in the Trinity?" And he said,
[58:26] "Well," he said, "I I was uh" I said,
[58:28] "You ever listen to his messages?" Well,
[58:30] no, but I was told, you know, by by
[58:32] wellestablished colleagues. I said,
[58:33] 'Well, your colleagues were wrong. I
[58:35] said, 'I've been raised under his
[58:37] teaching. I've been preaching it for for
[58:39] more than 30 years. I can tell you right
[58:40] now, he most certainly did believe the
[58:42] Trinity.
[58:43] And my goodness, you never heard
[58:45] somebody get so nervous. I
[58:48] Well, I I thought so. I mean, I I
[58:50] thought I now he's got now he said it on
[58:52] the air.
[58:54] And so, I kind of waited because that's
[58:57] my sneaky way. And I I just kind of
[59:00] waited for, you know, a little bit of
[59:02] drama, a little bit of effect. And I
[59:03] said, "Now, he didn't believe in the
[59:05] Catholic version of the Trinity, but he
[59:07] certainly believed in the Bible version
[59:09] of the Trinity." He said, "What what's
[59:12] the difference?" I said, "Well, Catholic
[59:14] has three three different gods." I said,
[59:16] "He saw it as three different offices."
[59:18] And then, no need to carry on the
[59:20] conversation. It didn't it didn't uh go
[59:24] too far after that.
[59:27] Watch this. Now God works his place in a
[59:31] trinity justification,
[59:34] sanctification
[59:36] and incarnate himself.
[59:39] Amen.
[59:40] Amen.
[59:40] Now I want you just to absorb that for a
[59:42] minute and say I thought justification
[59:43] sanctification baptism of the Holy
[59:44] Ghost. Yeah, it is exactly right.
[59:46] Amen.
[59:47] Justification because he's got to he's
[59:49] got to erase all your previous old sins.
[59:53] Now justification don't do a thing for
[59:54] your future sins. It's only takes
[59:56] everything you've ever done and
[59:58] justifies you of it.
[1:00:00] But then there's sanctification that
[1:00:02] comes in and takes over your life and
[1:00:04] you start going to church and you stop
[1:00:06] lying. You start loving the Lord.
[1:00:07] Brother Brandham says it's it's God
[1:00:09] getting a hold of your spirit so he can
[1:00:11] so he can talk to you.
[1:00:13] So he's trying to get you to the full
[1:00:14] new birth. And if you keep going on, you
[1:00:16] say, "Oh, I want to be born again." Do
[1:00:18] you know what that means?
[1:00:21] Is the Is the new birth just something
[1:00:23] some emotion that you felt or some words
[1:00:25] that you said?
[1:00:27] The new birth is God incarnating himself
[1:00:32] in his people.
[1:00:35] This isn't just a movement or some
[1:00:37] religion or some doctrine. This is an
[1:00:40] event. This is a happening. This is a
[1:00:42] reality. This message, you've been
[1:00:45] prophesied right into the literal life
[1:00:48] of God.
[1:00:49] Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:00:51] Amen.
[1:00:52] Justification, sanctification, and
[1:00:54] incarnate himself in his people with the
[1:00:57] baptism of the Holy Ghost.
[1:01:00] That's what the Holy Ghost is given for.
[1:01:04] That's what it is. That's what it does.
[1:01:08] And that's why it came.
[1:01:10] So now, see, so now he's he's exposing
[1:01:15] the the the low down copycat, Lucifer.
[1:01:19] Yeah.
[1:01:20] He says, "See, same thing. The devil is
[1:01:22] is just in type after Christ." See,
[1:01:25] Satan incarnates himself. Now, watch.
[1:01:28] When Jesus incarnates himself in his
[1:01:31] people, the very life that was in Christ
[1:01:36] is in the person. Amen.
[1:01:39] So if you're wondering why the world is
[1:01:42] so evil, wonder no longer
[1:01:46] because the he has incarnated himself in
[1:01:49] his people. And when God incarnates
[1:01:52] himself in them, they live the very life
[1:01:54] that was in Christ is in is now in me is
[1:01:57] now in you. So absent of that, then
[1:02:00] there's only two powers. You're either
[1:02:02] incarnated by Christ or you're
[1:02:04] incarnated by Satan. And I'm here to
[1:02:06] tell you that's the age you have arrived
[1:02:09] at.
[1:02:09] When you hear us talk about the end of
[1:02:12] the world, the end time, the last days,
[1:02:14] this is what's being accomplished.
[1:02:18] Amen.
[1:02:20] Amen.
[1:02:21] There's a church.
[1:02:24] There's a world
[1:02:26] becoming more and more and more wicked
[1:02:29] and evil until it gets to the point
[1:02:33] where it can't get any worse. until it
[1:02:35] does.
[1:02:36] Amen.
[1:02:40] It can't possibly get more perverted and
[1:02:42] than it does,
[1:02:43] right?
[1:02:44] Until it can't get worse until it does.
[1:02:47] And every um listen friends, on almost a
[1:02:50] a monthly basis,
[1:02:53] you know as well as I know,
[1:02:55] on nearly a monthly basis, we have to
[1:02:57] recalibrate what evil is.
[1:03:00] the the goalposts keep getting moved
[1:03:02] because you think, my this this is as
[1:03:04] bad as it can get. No,
[1:03:06] it's going to get much worse than it is
[1:03:09] right now.
[1:03:10] But it's also going to get much better
[1:03:13] than it is right now for a group of
[1:03:15] people who are the incarnated word. I'm
[1:03:18] here to tell you, it's going to get way
[1:03:21] better for people who are the incarnated
[1:03:24] word. Oh, I'm so glad that I believed a
[1:03:27] word. I've been prophesied right into
[1:03:30] it.
[1:03:32] It's took over my life. It's It's shaped
[1:03:35] and molded my goals, my dreams. It's
[1:03:37] changed everything.
[1:03:40] It caused me, as I've said to you
[1:03:43] before, once I met Jesus, I didn't want
[1:03:45] to be me anymore. Amen.
[1:03:47] I was like Jacob when he come down there
[1:03:49] after a life of you know just such a
[1:03:52] shyer and a gambler and a liar and a
[1:03:54] cheater and and cheating everybody and
[1:03:58] you know and and and here he comes to
[1:04:01] wrestle it with the angel and I I just I
[1:04:04] when I look at that whenever I go read
[1:04:06] that chapter I just say Jacob oh boy you
[1:04:09] are really tired of being Jacob aren't
[1:04:11] you? Amen.
[1:04:13] And then I hear Jacob answer, "Yes." And
[1:04:18] then I realize I'm the one talking.
[1:04:21] Yes.
[1:04:23] I'm done with Jacob.
[1:04:25] I don't want nothing to do with Jacob.
[1:04:28] He is such an enemy to me, brother Jack.
[1:04:31] Oh, if I wish I could shed him. I wish I
[1:04:34] could get rid of him. I wish the real me
[1:04:36] it will.
[1:04:38] I want to be free. You will be.
[1:04:40] Hallelujah.
[1:04:42] Oh, you're going to sing on that
[1:04:44] beautiful shore. As brother Brandham
[1:04:47] said, I'll sing on that beautiful shore.
[1:04:49] I remind the devil, I don't care what's
[1:04:51] happened yesterday or what might happen
[1:04:52] tomorrow. I'm going to sing on that
[1:04:54] beautiful shore.
[1:05:00] When Jesus incarnates himself and his
[1:05:02] people, the very life that was in Christ
[1:05:03] is in the person.
[1:05:06] Come and see.
[1:05:09] That's the message of the fourth seal.
[1:05:11] That's the message of the first, second,
[1:05:12] third, and fourth.
[1:05:14] From the lion to the ox to the man to
[1:05:19] the flying eagle, they all had a common
[1:05:22] message. Come and see.
[1:05:25] Not come and be persuaded. Come and get
[1:05:28] a revelation.
[1:05:31] See,
[1:05:32] so then the the second quote that's been
[1:05:34] burning on me is from the Invisible
[1:05:36] Union,
[1:05:39] very near the end of Brother's life and
[1:05:42] ministry.
[1:05:46] November 25, 1965. Look at the elected
[1:05:51] Abraham church pulled out.
[1:05:54] Big difference, isn't it? Not joining
[1:05:56] up.
[1:05:58] Pulled out.
[1:06:01] Look what kind of sign. Now, now just
[1:06:04] stay with me cuz I know what I'm about
[1:06:08] to say. You're like me. You've heard it
[1:06:12] a bunch of times over the years to where
[1:06:14] it's been, yeah, okay, I can almost
[1:06:16] quote it. I I know the point you're
[1:06:18] already about to make. And this is where
[1:06:21] Brother Brandham constantly went to. Now
[1:06:24] watch. He says, "Look what kind of sign
[1:06:28] that Jesus himself,
[1:06:31] the incarnated God standing there in
[1:06:34] human flesh." Now he's talking about
[1:06:35] Abraham. This is Melzdc,
[1:06:37] right? This is when Melzdc came to
[1:06:41] Abraham to confirm the promise
[1:06:44] and he was it's not like when he met him
[1:06:47] at the slaughter of the kings as as a
[1:06:50] theophony that which is why he didn't
[1:06:52] eat. He served Abraham communion. He
[1:06:54] didn't eat anything cuz thees don't eat.
[1:06:57] So that's why in the upper that's why
[1:06:59] when he came into the room with the
[1:07:00] disciples he said do you have any any
[1:07:02] meat here? Cuz now he's in a glorified
[1:07:04] state. He's not theophony and glorified.
[1:07:06] And so now he's actually going to eat.
[1:07:09] And Abraham is going to serve a meal and
[1:07:13] he's going to eat a calf sandwich and
[1:07:14] drink buttermilk and sit down like he's
[1:07:16] a human
[1:07:18] and yet he's God.
[1:07:21] Completely God.
[1:07:23] and and say how did he become a human?
[1:07:25] Was he born of a woman? No. Only Jesus.
[1:07:27] Jesus was the only begotten
[1:07:30] of the father because he was born of a
[1:07:32] woman. Melzdc he just was a God created
[1:07:36] a body took pot pash calcium cosmic
[1:07:40] light all these things the 16 elements
[1:07:42] that make up a body and blew himself a
[1:07:44] body and then just stepped into it and
[1:07:47] he came to meet Abraham and he has two
[1:07:50] messengers with him. and he blew them
[1:07:52] into bodies and brought them along and
[1:07:54] they're going to go on down to Sodom
[1:07:55] because they're not to Abraham. The one
[1:07:57] who's God in flesh is to Abraham.
[1:08:00] Hallelujah.
[1:08:01] See, and that's why you have G R A G R A
[1:08:06] H A M six letters. Graham,
[1:08:09] but Abraham is seven letters.
[1:08:12] See? And so so you find and then and
[1:08:15] then you find that the messenger to
[1:08:17] Sodom is six letters and the messenger
[1:08:20] to the bride is seven letters both
[1:08:22] ending in hamm. Amen.
[1:08:24] See, so so you find him coming and
[1:08:28] brother Brandham says, watch this now.
[1:08:31] He calls him Jesus,
[1:08:33] which is true. Although don't get
[1:08:36] confused. Brother Ram says, "Now we
[1:08:37] don't hear of Melzdc no more because he
[1:08:39] later became Jesus. That's the
[1:08:40] incarnated man born of a woman." Matthew
[1:08:43] 1:18.
[1:08:45] All right. So, but remember that the one
[1:08:49] born in Matthew chapter 1, that human
[1:08:52] man when when when the that's when he's
[1:08:55] born as a human. But the Bible, Paul
[1:08:58] told the church that that all things
[1:09:00] were made that Jesus Christ made
[1:09:02] everything
[1:09:04] that that everything was made by Jesus
[1:09:07] Christ. It's why Mary was told you will
[1:09:09] call his name Jesus. That was an
[1:09:11] important point because that was his
[1:09:12] name.
[1:09:13] Make sure you call him Jesus because
[1:09:15] that's been his name now for a long
[1:09:17] time. See, and it's his name under
[1:09:18] redemption. And so we find that he says
[1:09:21] here, he goes on now watch. He says that
[1:09:25] Jesus himself, here's the sign. Here's
[1:09:27] the sign that the elected called out
[1:09:30] Abraham group Saul,
[1:09:33] the incarnated God standing there in
[1:09:37] human flesh.
[1:09:39] You say because it's a modern
[1:09:41] theological debate. You say that was an
[1:09:45] angel. That's what many theologians say.
[1:09:49] Or is just a just a man,
[1:09:51] you know, as our again our local
[1:09:55] megaurch super preacher. He's just a
[1:09:58] man.
[1:10:01] He was born and he's die and he has mom
[1:10:03] and dad and he's going to die.
[1:10:06] You know, he's long ago dead.
[1:10:09] And I'm like, well, how how why does the
[1:10:11] Bible say that he abideth continually
[1:10:14] and he has no beginning of life, no
[1:10:16] beginning or ending of life,
[1:10:18] and abideth forever.
[1:10:21] And and I go right back to Brother
[1:10:22] Brad's hillbilly common sense. Whoever
[1:10:25] he was, he's still alive.
[1:10:28] I love Hillbilly common sense.
[1:10:31] Whoever he was, he's still alive. Yes.
[1:10:34] And as you and you're about to see why
[1:10:36] he's still alive. That's not just a
[1:10:39] little thing to say. There's a big big
[1:10:41] thing behind why he's still alive. Why
[1:10:43] he abideth a priest continually.
[1:10:46] See? And and so watch. So he says here,
[1:10:49] the incarnated God standing there in
[1:10:51] human flesh. You say that was an angel.
[1:10:52] The Bible said it was God, which bears
[1:10:54] out. The Old Testament word that Abraham
[1:10:57] called him in the Hebrew is never ever
[1:11:00] ever used except in a connotation of the
[1:11:03] Almighty.
[1:11:04] It's always referring to the Almighty
[1:11:06] God.
[1:11:07] He says, "The Bible said it was God,
[1:11:10] Lord God, Elohim, standing there in
[1:11:14] human flesh,
[1:11:16] showing,
[1:11:18] watch now, showing that he would so
[1:11:23] anoint his church in the last days."
[1:11:28] Amen.
[1:11:28] Amen.
[1:11:30] Now, here he is 2,000 years before he's
[1:11:35] even going to incarnate himself in a in
[1:11:37] a and a a child born of a woman. 2,000
[1:11:41] years prior to that, he's already
[1:11:43] looking 2,000 years to that and 2,000
[1:11:45] years past that to the last day, aka
[1:11:49] your day. Yes. Amen.
[1:11:51] So, here is 4,000 years ago and he's
[1:11:56] standing there as God in human flesh to
[1:11:59] do what? To do what? To so showing He's
[1:12:04] showing. So, it's come and see.
[1:12:06] He's showing that he would so anoint his
[1:12:10] church in the last days. It be God
[1:12:14] working in human flesh again. as it was
[1:12:18] in the days of Sodom, so shall it be at
[1:12:19] the coming of the son of man. Same kind
[1:12:21] of thing. See, they see it right there
[1:12:24] in the scriptures. So, this this is why
[1:12:27] the question, the epic question.
[1:12:30] This is why a prophet comes and he's
[1:12:32] going to preach a sermon. Who is this
[1:12:36] Melzdc?
[1:12:39] Now, I want you to think about this for
[1:12:41] a minute. Here's a prophet with a
[1:12:44] limited amount of time in the earth.
[1:12:47] He's only got so many days allotted to
[1:12:49] him. He's not going to make it to the
[1:12:51] rapture. No one knows that at the time.
[1:12:52] Even he don't know it at the time. But
[1:12:54] he's he he's got a he's got a a fixed
[1:12:57] amount of time to be in the earth. And
[1:12:59] he's and he's going as hard as he can.
[1:13:00] And he's only got so many sermons he can
[1:13:03] preach. And his ser his his preaching
[1:13:06] and his sermons are are what God is
[1:13:09] going to use to perfect a bride down
[1:13:11] through 2,000 years.
[1:13:14] I mean, am I building an important case
[1:13:16] in your mind?
[1:13:17] This is This is all the marbles. This is
[1:13:20] everything.
[1:13:21] This is God. This is 6,000 years of God
[1:13:25] working to restore Eden.
[1:13:29] And while he's doing that, he's letting
[1:13:31] Satan build his Eden so there can be
[1:13:33] this titanic clash of titans at the end
[1:13:36] between Christ and Antichrist. and a
[1:13:39] people who are being incarnated by Satan
[1:13:41] and a people who are called out and
[1:13:43] incarnated by God
[1:13:45] and he's 4,000 years ago. And so that's
[1:13:47] why they can argue all they want. You
[1:13:49] know, he was a man. He lived. He died.
[1:13:51] No, he was an angel. No, he was a
[1:13:52] phantom. No, he was this. No, he was
[1:13:53] that. But God had to settle the question
[1:13:56] and actually take a prophet with limited
[1:13:59] time and say, "You need to go to a
[1:14:01] pullpit and preach and answer this
[1:14:05] question. What question, Lord? Who is
[1:14:07] this Melzdc? Say, why is it so
[1:14:10] important? Because in Melchazdc, he's
[1:14:13] going to show you and me, the people of
[1:14:16] the end time.
[1:14:18] He's going to show you what he's what
[1:14:19] the plan is that God is going to
[1:14:23] incarnate himself by a people who have
[1:14:26] believed every word of God, who have
[1:14:28] taken it as their as their very life,
[1:14:31] and it's more important to them than
[1:14:32] life. I'm here to tell you friends, this
[1:14:34] thing isn't something we play around
[1:14:36] with. This isn't doctrine memorization.
[1:14:39] This isn't about camps or arguments.
[1:14:41] This is life.
[1:14:43] [Applause]
[1:14:45] This is God's remedy
[1:14:48] to give you
[1:14:50] life.
[1:14:53] Hallelujah.
[1:14:54] Everlasting.
[1:14:55] That's right.
[1:14:57] I mean,
[1:15:00] we were Chris and I were talking about
[1:15:02] it today. You know, you get people
[1:15:06] who just and there's an epidemic of it.
[1:15:09] People, you know, committing suicide.
[1:15:12] They've even glamorized it.
[1:15:15] It's among among teens. It's almost like
[1:15:17] a cool thing.
[1:15:20] And and I I think it's because that
[1:15:23] we've stopped preaching hell, Fire, and
[1:15:25] Brimstone.
[1:15:27] Somebody needs to tell them
[1:15:29] that if you if you end your life here,
[1:15:34] it doesn't end here.
[1:15:37] The bottom line is you don't have that
[1:15:39] power.
[1:15:40] You can stop this biological thing from
[1:15:43] working.
[1:15:44] But you can't end your life.
[1:15:47] Your life just picks up in another form.
[1:15:51] And you either have a word body
[1:15:53] theophony to step into or an anti-word
[1:15:56] body to step into. And you're either
[1:15:58] going up or you're going down.
[1:16:02] You're either going into the paradise of
[1:16:04] God or you're going into the worst
[1:16:07] horror. Horror. The worst nightmare.
[1:16:11] You've never had a nightmare
[1:16:14] like this.
[1:16:15] That's right.
[1:16:16] Amen. And people do that to escape the
[1:16:20] pain. As if this life has the ability to
[1:16:22] equal in pain and misery what that's
[1:16:24] going to be.
[1:16:29] This life in its worst condition and on
[1:16:32] your worst day is not even to be
[1:16:34] compared
[1:16:35] to the existence
[1:16:37] beyond this realm.
[1:16:40] See, people say, "Do you you don't
[1:16:42] believe in purgatory?" I do. I'm in it.
[1:16:46] Amen.
[1:16:47] If you're referring to that which is
[1:16:49] between heaven and hell, I'm in it.
[1:16:52] And I don't need a priest to pray me out
[1:16:53] of here. I'm being prophesied out of
[1:16:55] here.
[1:16:56] Hallelujah.
[1:16:57] Oh, glory to God. My faith. I got eagle
[1:17:00] wings to lift me up out of here.
[1:17:03] Oh friends, that's what this whole
[1:17:06] that's what the that's why the question
[1:17:08] had to be answered by a prophet
[1:17:12] so that there would be it's not going to
[1:17:14] be left ambiguous
[1:17:16] it's not going to be left in any kind of
[1:17:18] a question it will be God working in
[1:17:22] human flesh again when at the last day
[1:17:25] what's the sign I'm looking for as it
[1:17:27] was in the days of Sodom
[1:17:30] see so shall it be in the coming of the
[1:17:32] son of Man, so this is why brother
[1:17:35] Brandham would even, you know, he would
[1:17:38] say, "Now look at that sign. Look at he
[1:17:40] with his back turned to the tent. He
[1:17:43] discerned the thoughts in the heart of
[1:17:45] Sarah behind him."
[1:17:47] Amen.
[1:17:48] And then brother Brandham's wheel
[1:17:49] around, turn his back to the audience
[1:17:50] and start discerning hearts.
[1:17:53] A sign that hasn't been seen since the
[1:17:55] days of Jesus.
[1:17:56] Amen.
[1:17:56] That's the sign of the son of man. since
[1:17:58] you you could probably find that in in
[1:18:01] in in some form working in the early
[1:18:02] church cuz that was the ministry of the
[1:18:04] son of man as well. That was
[1:18:05] continuation of the of the ministry of
[1:18:07] the son of man. But we find that once
[1:18:09] once the light of the word started to go
[1:18:12] out and you get past Ireneius and then
[1:18:14] you don't even have a correct
[1:18:15] interpretation of the godhead anymore.
[1:18:17] And so now that that whole thing is now
[1:18:20] returning at the end time. And brother
[1:18:22] Brandham, brother Brandham is not up
[1:18:24] there trying to show he's the prophet of
[1:18:27] the age.
[1:18:28] He didn't even want to be the prophet of
[1:18:30] anything. He wanted to be a hunter and a
[1:18:32] trapper and leave people alone.
[1:18:36] But and so it's so it's not it's not
[1:18:38] even about his own human choice. It's
[1:18:40] not about your human choice.
[1:18:42] Say, "Oh, I just wish I could fit in."
[1:18:44] You're never going to fit in. You
[1:18:46] weren't put here to fit in.
[1:18:48] You're put here to so that so that you
[1:18:51] can say to the world, somebody can say,
[1:18:52] "Where is life?" You can say, "Come and
[1:18:54] see.
[1:18:56] How do I escape misery?" Come and see.
[1:18:58] What do I do about my depression? Come
[1:19:00] and see.
[1:19:01] Oh, I feel oppressed and I got all kinds
[1:19:03] of problems. What do I do? Come and see.
[1:19:07] And people are have glamorized suicide,
[1:19:10] jumping out of windows and and and and
[1:19:13] taking their own life.
[1:19:15] a life they didn't even give, life they
[1:19:17] can't control, and somehow thinking that
[1:19:20] that they're entitled to take it.
[1:19:26] So, it's going to show the bride of the
[1:19:28] last day, God's plan of restoration.
[1:19:33] He's going to bring the full token back
[1:19:35] to his family at the end time.
[1:19:38] Amen.
[1:19:39] And he's going to incarnate himself in a
[1:19:41] bride through preaching. Y
[1:19:46] through prophesying the message of the
[1:19:48] hour, you're lit. You know what it's
[1:19:49] going to produce? It's producing a
[1:19:51] called out people
[1:19:52] with the mind of Christ.
[1:19:54] Amen.
[1:19:55] And the other, which is everything
[1:19:57] outside of that, is Satan uh copying
[1:20:02] God, incarnating himself. And you know
[1:20:05] what it's doing? It's making a a beast
[1:20:07] right into people, making the mark of
[1:20:09] the beast right into people.
[1:20:11] Yeah. Amen.
[1:20:13] And instead of having the mind of
[1:20:14] Christ, total insanity.
[1:20:18] Amen.
[1:20:19] So this is the plan of God to counter
[1:20:23] the days of Lot and the days of Noah.
[1:20:25] That is this is how God's going to do
[1:20:26] it. This is how God is bringing the
[1:20:28] strength that we need for for the the
[1:20:31] day and hour that we live in where where
[1:20:33] the ma because now the madness is
[1:20:35] global. I mean, let's face it, the
[1:20:37] madness is global. Amen.
[1:20:39] You know, I I we hear and I and I and
[1:20:42] I'm I don't want to go too far into this
[1:20:44] because it's probably where I'm going to
[1:20:46] be someday, but you know, if if I wanted
[1:20:48] to convince the world of some statement
[1:20:51] and I said, "Man, I need some really
[1:20:53] highprofile who's the highest profile
[1:20:55] person I could get." If it's really
[1:20:57] imperative that the world catch a
[1:20:59] certain thing that they need to hear who
[1:21:03] who's the most powerful man in the
[1:21:05] world, it's obviously and has been for
[1:21:07] some number of decades, the office of
[1:21:10] the presidency of the United States and
[1:21:13] he's considered the most powerful man in
[1:21:15] the world. Now, we know he's not.
[1:21:19] We know that the the one in the Vatican
[1:21:21] is much more powerful. Amen.
[1:21:24] See, but but it but but as far as the
[1:21:26] world is concerned, if you've got to get
[1:21:28] a message that's got to resound and
[1:21:30] people have got to have some confidence
[1:21:31] in it, you're going to use uh pus to do
[1:21:34] it. And so here you've got pus coming up
[1:21:39] to say that we haven't faced
[1:21:44] the chance of Armageddon.
[1:21:47] And he's actually using a biblical word.
[1:21:49] We haven't faced Armageddon. and like
[1:21:52] since the day of the the Cuban missile
[1:21:55] crisis. And I thought that was amazing
[1:21:58] because when you go back to the Cuban
[1:22:02] missile crisis,
[1:22:04] they were needlessly caught offguard. If
[1:22:09] you go back into the history, you've got
[1:22:11] a prophet starting all the way back at
[1:22:13] the beginning that that happened in late
[1:22:15] late 1962.
[1:22:18] a prophet almost two years ahead of that
[1:22:21] starts talking about the threat that
[1:22:24] Russia poses. I'm gonna read the quotes
[1:22:26] tonight. Maybe get to them someday. The
[1:22:29] threat that Russia poses and brother
[1:22:31] Brandon just blows it off to say Cuba
[1:22:34] could do it right now.
[1:22:37] And he says, "Here they are worried
[1:22:38] about Cuba. And did you hear the
[1:22:40] president say he's going to make an
[1:22:41] example out of Berlin?" And and he said
[1:22:43] and here's Cuba right in their backyard.
[1:22:46] And he said and he's like two or three
[1:22:48] different places years before the
[1:22:50] becomes a crisis but nobody's listening
[1:22:52] to the prophet.
[1:22:54] That's who POTUS should have been lift
[1:22:55] listening to. JFK should have been
[1:22:57] listening to William Brandham. He said
[1:22:59] wow did you guys hey let's gather the
[1:23:00] Pentagon. There's a prophet in Indiana
[1:23:02] who said we better worry about Cuba and
[1:23:05] they wouldn't have got caught flatfooted
[1:23:07] like that. See and so now now you've got
[1:23:11] uh the president of the United States
[1:23:13] today. He's going back to that missile
[1:23:16] crisis and saying, "Now, we haven't been
[1:23:19] this close to Armageddon." And I'm going
[1:23:21] to tell you something, friends. I love
[1:23:23] when Brother Brandham, he comes in 1956
[1:23:28] and he preaches a sermon that went right
[1:23:31] over the heads of of America because it
[1:23:35] was their last year to accept grace.
[1:23:39] And and they're coming right down to the
[1:23:41] end and they're not going to take it.
[1:23:42] The prophet can see it. He's warned
[1:23:44] them. The Jubilee is passing. It came in
[1:23:47] 1906. Here it is 50 years later. It's a
[1:23:50] Jubilee. And he says, "This year, you'll
[1:23:52] either accept it this year or from here
[1:23:54] you'll go down, down." And historically,
[1:23:56] they have. It has went down, down, down,
[1:23:58] down.
[1:24:00] And he preaches a sermon titled the
[1:24:03] invasion of the USA.
[1:24:07] And here they're worried about bomb
[1:24:10] shelters in Russia. They're not even
[1:24:12] thinking about Cuba and they've got this
[1:24:14] going on and that going and they're
[1:24:15] trying they're trying to hold the world
[1:24:17] together. I understand that. I
[1:24:20] understand that. I'm not ridiculing
[1:24:22] them. I mean, that's what I would be
[1:24:24] doing. I'd be trying to do everything I
[1:24:25] could. I'd just have to, you know,
[1:24:27] nobody really knows how to do it.
[1:24:28] They're just having to figure it out as
[1:24:30] they go. The experts say that out in the
[1:24:32] open. All they can do is think about
[1:24:33] history and well, this worked, this
[1:24:35] didn't work. It's like the economy. You
[1:24:37] You want to have something make you
[1:24:38] nervous? here hear Greenspan literally
[1:24:41] say, you know, well, we're we're
[1:24:43] supposed to keep the economy going, but
[1:24:44] the problem is nobody really knows how
[1:24:45] to do it,
[1:24:46] right?
[1:24:48] And and the interviewer said, "You got
[1:24:49] to be kidding. You're supposed to know
[1:24:51] how to do it." He goes, "No, no one
[1:24:52] actually knows how." He said, "We're
[1:24:54] just trying to all we can ever do is
[1:24:55] give it our best educated guess based on
[1:24:58] history and based on numbers and models,
[1:24:59] but the models move and the, you know,
[1:25:01] the future's always moving. We don't
[1:25:03] know." And and that's how uncertain the
[1:25:05] world is. And yet here is solid rock
[1:25:08] and they won't stand on it.
[1:25:11] Think of how privileged you are. The
[1:25:13] fact that God has given you the ability
[1:25:16] to believe every word.
[1:25:18] No wonder your hearts aren't failing for
[1:25:20] fear. No wonder you wake up every day
[1:25:23] and you love the Lord and you look
[1:25:25] you're still looking for Mount Zion. And
[1:25:27] there's nothing not enough devils in
[1:25:29] this world to throw you off track. I'm
[1:25:32] here to tell you something, friends.
[1:25:33] There's nothing going to throw me off
[1:25:35] track.
[1:25:36] The world is unaware. They say,
[1:25:38] "America, were we ever going to get
[1:25:39] invaded?" They were invaded. Brother, a
[1:25:41] prophet preached the invasion of the
[1:25:43] USA. And it was an invasion of demons
[1:25:46] taking over the nation because the
[1:25:49] nation rejected God for the last time.
[1:25:54] I'm here to tell you something, friends.
[1:25:56] One of these times they're going to give
[1:25:57] a speech for the last time. One of these
[1:26:00] times, they're going to have an election
[1:26:01] for the last time. One of these times
[1:26:04] you're going to come to a Wednesday
[1:26:05] night for the last time and you're not
[1:26:09] going to need to come back here on
[1:26:11] Sunday
[1:26:13] because every day is going to be an
[1:26:15] eternal day.
[1:26:17] Hallelujah. That's what that's why he
[1:26:19] had to answer the question.
[1:26:22] Who is this Melzdc?
[1:26:25] And only the called out
[1:26:27] catch it.
[1:26:29] When the two messengers went down to
[1:26:30] Sodom,
[1:26:32] Lords plural,
[1:26:34] they're not even catching the oneness
[1:26:37] between Christ and his bride.
[1:26:40] Hallelujah.
[1:26:41] Oh, let's stand up, friends. I got to
[1:26:43] stop here. I'm going to end up in my
[1:26:44] Sunday notes. Oh, what a glorious
[1:26:48] revelation of the word of God for this
[1:26:50] hour. to imagine to try to get your mind
[1:26:53] around the fact of what God has done and
[1:26:56] what God has called you to.
[1:26:59] It's a serious time.
[1:27:02] This is God's plan, as I was saying, to
[1:27:06] counter the days of Lot and Noah because
[1:27:08] the madness is now global and the
[1:27:12] beast's mind
[1:27:14] has literally
[1:27:16] well, it's permeated
[1:27:18] into every level of society.
[1:27:22] with Satan incarnating himself
[1:27:24] throughout humanity
[1:27:26] in his perfect Eden. You know that he
[1:27:29] said 6,000 years he's incarnating
[1:27:32] himself and has incarnated himself
[1:27:35] throughout humanity coming to his
[1:27:37] perfect Eden. And it's just that it's
[1:27:40] just at this time that God perfects a
[1:27:43] bride right under his nose.
[1:27:46] And I say praise be to God.
[1:27:51] God right right at the time right at the
[1:27:54] time he's perfecting his bride Christ is
[1:27:57] perfecting his he's marrying her in
[1:28:00] invisible union so the world don't
[1:28:03] believe it that's cuz it's invisible
[1:28:08] they're going to find out one of these
[1:28:09] days they're going to look around
[1:28:11] brother said they're going to say well I
[1:28:13] thought Elijah was supposed to come I
[1:28:14] thought this was supposed to happen and
[1:28:16] he said they'll hear a voice say it's
[1:28:19] already come and you didn't know it. Oh
[1:28:23] my my my my. Let's bow our heads now.
[1:28:25] Father,
[1:28:27] we thank you for your word tonight.
[1:28:30] Thank you, Lord. It thrills me so much.
[1:28:32] It just means so much to me when I start
[1:28:35] to think of it, Lord, and we begin to
[1:28:38] break it down and the reality of it be
[1:28:40] it be we we start to absorb it and I
[1:28:42] realize, my goodness, I I this is
[1:28:46] happening and I'm in the big middle of
[1:28:48] it. Hallelujah.
[1:28:49] It's happening all around me. It's like
[1:28:51] I'm being caught in a vortex of prophecy
[1:28:53] and it's just wrapping up
[1:28:55] lifting a bride right off the earth. Oh,
[1:28:58] master,
[1:28:59] we pray tonight for all of our loved
[1:29:01] ones. We pray for our families tonight.
[1:29:04] This is such a serious time. I pray for
[1:29:07] parents to have wisdom, Lord, for their
[1:29:10] children, for their teenagers. I pray
[1:29:13] for teenagers, Lord, that they be filled
[1:29:15] with your spirit. Oh God,
[1:29:17] I pray for the single. I pray for the
[1:29:19] married. I pray for the young. I pray
[1:29:21] for the elderly. Lord, I pray for the
[1:29:24] ministers. I pray for the leoty. I one
[1:29:26] and all. All in one. Oh God,
[1:29:29] we must see you clearly. We must. We
[1:29:31] must see you.
[1:29:35] No wonder Satan fills up our lives with
[1:29:37] every kind of distraction.
[1:29:40] That's not new. That's not novel. He's
[1:29:43] been doing that for a long time.
[1:29:47] What it's not even alarming that he's
[1:29:49] doing that. What's alarming
[1:29:52] is that he's
[1:29:55] has too much success
[1:29:58] in those who are your family
[1:30:01] who ought to be that ingrained in the
[1:30:04] world. Ought to be. They oughtn't to be
[1:30:07] that that far out that they can't feel
[1:30:10] that movement of the Holy Spirit looking
[1:30:13] to incarnate itself within their lives.
[1:30:16] I pray Lord God for your family. I pray
[1:30:19] for the strong. I pray for the weak. I
[1:30:21] pray for those who are strong in faith,
[1:30:23] those who are weak in faith, those with
[1:30:25] a strong commitment and those who need a
[1:30:27] strong commitment.
[1:30:29] I pray, oh God, for our homes. This is a
[1:30:31] treacherous time and the enemy has
[1:30:34] incarnated himself and it's permeated
[1:30:36] society at every level. There is no
[1:30:38] clean place.
[1:30:41] I pray Lord God that you will help us in
[1:30:43] these closing scenes of history. We
[1:30:45] don't know how many days we have left
[1:30:48] but we know the last day is approaching
[1:30:50] rapidly.
[1:30:53] We're up against a fixed we're up
[1:30:55] against a fixed date.
[1:30:58] a fixed date that Jesus said the father
[1:31:00] had it in his head when he was going to
[1:31:02] restore Israel. You're going to restore
[1:31:04] Israel. They ask you, "Will you at this
[1:31:06] time restore Israel?" And and Jesus said
[1:31:09] the father has that to himself. There is
[1:31:11] a time when he's going to send Moses and
[1:31:14] Elijah and restore Israel. That's a
[1:31:16] fixed time. That's on the calendar now.
[1:31:20] We don't know how close we are to it,
[1:31:23] but we know we're being backed up
[1:31:25] against a an unmovable line.
[1:31:28] And you're going to have to exodus your
[1:31:30] bride before before you can do that. So,
[1:31:33] master,
[1:31:35] prophetically speaking, time can't just
[1:31:38] keep going on. I know it can seem like
[1:31:40] that. The devil gets people thinking
[1:31:42] that way. Oh, where is the promise of
[1:31:44] his coming? For since the fathers fell
[1:31:46] asleep, all things are the same and
[1:31:48] nothing changes. Oh, it does. It's
[1:31:50] changing. Every day that calendar
[1:31:53] changes. it comes nearer to that fixed
[1:31:55] date that the father knows we're coming
[1:31:59] up against a fixed a fixed wall and
[1:32:01] we're going to have to be ready. And
[1:32:04] once it reaches that wall, whoever's not
[1:32:06] ready will will be left behind to face a
[1:32:11] world of tribulation. Don't let that be
[1:32:13] me, oh God. Don't let that be any of my
[1:32:16] loved ones. Don't let that be anybody in
[1:32:18] this church. Oh master, help us tonight.
[1:32:20] Lord God, help us to be serious minded
[1:32:23] to see the the hour that we've arrived
[1:32:26] at. Your coming is soon. It has to be
[1:32:29] very soon.
[1:32:31] So, we thank you. We see the world
[1:32:33] falling to pieces all around us.
[1:32:36] I pray that you will move on our hearts,
[1:32:38] Lord God, to to to desire to pull close
[1:32:42] to you at this hour. Pull away from the
[1:32:45] world. Pull close to you. May you grant
[1:32:47] it, Lord.
[1:32:49] We love you for this service tonight. I
[1:32:51] thank you for your great grace and your
[1:32:54] great mercy to us. I commit it to you in
[1:32:57] Jesus name. Amen. Let me look at prayer
[1:33:00] requests. Brother Anthony, sing for us.

[1:37:07] doctors said unless uh the doctor said
[1:37:10] results on her biopsy of the small mass
[1:37:13] in her lung was positive for cancer. The
[1:37:17] good news is they caught it early and
[1:37:19] are recommending surgery to remove it
[1:37:21] with no other treatments needed. Just u
[1:37:24] join us in prayer and believing this
[1:37:26] tumor will shrink between now and when
[1:37:29] the surgery is scheduled. So it won't
[1:37:31] even be necessary. Amen. I'll pray for
[1:37:34] that. Praise the Lord that God will
[1:37:38] absolutely move for these needs. Uh so
[1:37:42] if you sent me something, I'm sorry I
[1:37:44] didn't see it. Uh I think I've got
[1:37:46] everything that was sent to me.
[1:37:48] Hopefully haven't overlooked anything.
[1:37:51] Praise the Lord. Amen. Let's bow our
[1:37:54] heads again.
[1:37:57] Father, we thank you tonight.
[1:38:00] And Lord, I I say as I I love those
[1:38:04] soothing words, Lord, that our deacon is
[1:38:07] fond of saying, "Lord, I love you."
[1:38:10] Lord, I love you. I love to hear that
[1:38:13] said and I love saying it. Lord, I love
[1:38:15] you. Father, we love you tonight.
[1:38:18] Master, we love you tonight. Oh Lord
[1:38:22] Jesus, our our king, our our maker, our
[1:38:27] oh father, the bridegroom of the bride,
[1:38:31] Lord, the giver of eternal life and all
[1:38:33] good things and you've give us your word
[1:38:35] and give us your spirit. We love you for
[1:38:37] this, Lord.
[1:38:39] Help us tonight, Lord, to absorb the
[1:38:41] words that we heard. May there be a
[1:38:44] manifestation, Lord. May you demonstrate
[1:38:47] your word as you as the Bible says in
[1:38:49] the book of Acts, he showed himself
[1:38:51] alive after his passion. You love to
[1:38:54] show yourself alive, oh God. And we
[1:38:57] thank you for that. We ask for these
[1:39:00] requests, Lord God. We're asking for
[1:39:02] Sister Chassity. We're asking for Sister
[1:39:04] Rebecca's uncle. We're asking for
[1:39:06] Brother George's mother. We're asking
[1:39:08] for this internet requests that come in.
[1:39:11] Lord, you heard those requests read. And
[1:39:14] father, you know what the need is there.
[1:39:17] And I pray, Lord God, that you will move
[1:39:20] supernaturally. Come here, Mason. Come
[1:39:23] here. Come here. Put your arms around
[1:39:26] me.
[1:39:28] Father, in the name of Jesus,
[1:39:31] cursed be the enemy, Lord, that's trying
[1:39:34] to torment. Demons are tormentors.
[1:39:38] They're tormentors, Lord. and I condemn
[1:39:41] Satan in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:39:43] Christ. Father, I deliver him in the
[1:39:46] name of the son of God. Lord, with the
[1:39:48] anointing upon me, I lay my arms and put
[1:39:51] my arms around him. He wraps his arms
[1:39:53] around me and I condemn the work of the
[1:39:55] enemy. On behalf of the kingdom of
[1:39:57] heaven, I speak deliverance and freedom
[1:40:00] on behalf of the family of God. I speak
[1:40:02] freedom and deliverance in the name of
[1:40:04] the Lord Jesus Christ. That name above
[1:40:06] all names. We condemn the enemy. Satan,
[1:40:09] you are defeated. You are exposed. You
[1:40:11] have no rights. You are a trespassor.
[1:40:14] This is a young man who loves the Lord
[1:40:16] and loves the word. And you have no
[1:40:18] rights. No rights whatsoever. Christ has
[1:40:21] removed them from you. And I condemn you
[1:40:24] from this very hour. You will take your
[1:40:26] hands off of God's property. We adjure
[1:40:29] you by Jesus Christ, the son of God, who
[1:40:31] defeated you at Calvary, stripped you of
[1:40:34] every power, and you have no power left.
[1:40:36] All power and authority is given unto
[1:40:39] Christ and he has given it unto his
[1:40:41] church and he has ordained me as a
[1:40:43] shepherd over this young man and I
[1:40:45] condemn you. I stand as a prophet said
[1:40:48] you hear me Satan. A prophet said I am
[1:40:51] commissioned to stand in the steps of
[1:40:54] Jesus Christ and to perform his works.
[1:40:57] You're a liar. Christ is true and you're
[1:40:59] condemned now. Leave him. I pray master
[1:41:02] in the name of Jesus Christ that the
[1:41:04] Holy Ghost who is the enforcer of God's
[1:41:07] word will see him to complete freedom
[1:41:09] and deliverance. Let it be so from this
[1:41:12] very hour in the name of Jesus Christ.
[1:41:15] Amen. Go believing it, Mace. God bless
[1:41:18] you. It's going to be all right. Amen.
[1:41:20] Praise the Lord. Sing for us, Brother
[1:41:22] Anthony. Amen.
[1:41:24] Amen.
