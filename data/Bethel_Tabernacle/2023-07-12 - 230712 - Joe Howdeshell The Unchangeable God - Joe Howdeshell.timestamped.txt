[31:26] something that would be really good I
[31:28] know years and years ago
[31:30] back when dinosaurs were still on the

[31:36] and we washed dinosaurs and made um some
[31:40] pretty good money for the youth group
[31:42] and that's how we funded everything that
[31:43] we did so I would encourage the young
[31:46] people Brother Brad I know he said he

[31:51] I would throw something out there too so
[31:53] be praying about it folks all right God

[57:03] that you you paid the awful ultimate
[57:06] price for it
[57:08] how we come here Lord just to gather
[57:12] together and so glad Lord to be in this
[57:15] this house has been set aside Lord for
[57:17] worship
[57:18] that's been dedicated Lord to thee and
[57:20] and for the purpose of coming here Lord
[57:23] and we're so thankful to have a place
[57:26] Lord to be able to come out of the
[57:28] weather and oh God we're so thankful for
[57:31] so many things
[57:32] Lord we just asked tonight Lord that you
[57:35] would just
[57:36] be with us as a song was sung earlier
[57:41] about Holy Spirit you're welcome in this
[57:44] place oh God feel that just fill the
[57:48] entire atmosphere Lord
[57:50] God that's what we come here for it's
[57:52] not just to be seen or to check off a a
[57:55] box Lord for the week but we come here
[57:58] Lord expecting to hear from you Lord we
[58:02] come here Lord expecting to lay down our
[58:05] burdens Lord one more time and take up
[58:08] that precious mantle of Salvation Lord
[58:10] of righteousness and walk out of here oh
[58:13] God different from when we came in Lord
[58:16] may that be the the testimony in the
[58:19] prayer of each person in here tonight
[58:20] father that we wouldn't leave the same
[58:22] way we came in Lord that we would all
[58:25] leave Lord high in higher Heights Lord
[58:27] and deeper depths with thee father God
[58:30] granted us our prayer we love you may
[58:33] you add your blessings to the reading of
[58:35] the word tonight in Jesus name we pray
[58:37] amen
[58:39] you can be seated
[58:40] and I certainly thank the Lord for his
[58:43] word and and I'm so glad that we have
[58:46] a constant
[58:48] my title for the sermon tonight is the
[58:50] unchangeable god
[58:52] and I'm so glad that we have something
[58:54] in this world that's unchanging
[58:57] I'm the Lord and I change not and you
[59:00] know I was just thinking about going
[59:01] down the road and I
[59:03] um you'll many times will go different
[59:05] places and we'll see where there used to
[59:07] be Woods or there used to be a place
[59:09] where we'd go hunting
[59:11] big Warehouse or it's a shopping center
[59:13] or we look and see where so and so used
[59:15] to live or we maybe we'll look back in
[59:18] Nostalgia and we'll say hey we used to I
[59:20] used to go into the uh the store with a
[59:23] dollar and I used to get a for a one
[59:25] dollar I could get a Coke and a candy
[59:27] bar and a whole sack full of Penny Candy
[59:29] there's no even such thing as that
[59:31] anymore there's no such thing as Penny
[59:33] Candy but things change and and we see
[59:36] things like that and going up 16 you see
[59:39] how that used to be just a bunch of
[59:40] wilderness all the way to the matter
[59:42] right the people for Metter now it's
[59:45] it's um it's it's already they've got
[59:47] the big thing going up the the electric
[59:49] car planning and so we see changes all
[59:52] the time and and and I'm so glad that we
[59:56] have something in this world that
[59:57] doesn't change and we've got um and I
[1:00:01] think about how that nothing lasts
[1:00:02] forever not one thing on this world is
[1:00:05] going to last forever thank you brother
[1:00:07] I was uh reading about I thought it was
[1:00:09] very interesting of a um a story about
[1:00:13] how when we go to the grocery store now
[1:00:15] y'all stay with me for just a minute I
[1:00:17] don't I don't try to lose you and get
[1:00:18] lost in the weeds give me just a second
[1:00:21] I'm going to go ahead and do this before
[1:00:23] I even get started
[1:00:25] coming
[1:00:27] up down here there we go now I can
[1:00:31] preach
[1:00:32] so I heard about
[1:00:35] I heard about this when we go to the
[1:00:36] grocery store and you buy a pound of of
[1:00:39] hamburger right it's measured out well
[1:00:43] under whose standard okay so you've got
[1:00:46] to have a standard somewhere so if you
[1:00:48] if you measure it by the standard of uh
[1:00:50] of a kilogram or a pound or whatever but
[1:00:53] it's got to go back to the original
[1:00:55] there's got to be an absolute somewhere
[1:00:58] and for 130 something years our absolute
[1:01:02] for measurement somebody probably knows
[1:01:04] this already was a a hunk of platinum
[1:01:08] and a hunk of iridium made by the French
[1:01:11] people because they had tried to have
[1:01:13] many different metals they tried steel
[1:01:16] they tried gold they tried water they
[1:01:19] tried all kinds of different things and
[1:01:21] everything would fluctuate it would
[1:01:24] never hold the same weight
[1:01:26] it was dependent on the atmosphere it
[1:01:29] was depending on the surrounding around
[1:01:30] it maybe the magnetic pool I don't know
[1:01:33] what it was but everything would
[1:01:34] fluctuate until they they came down to
[1:01:38] this one piece of metal that was
[1:01:40] absolute the absolute and it was
[1:01:44] platinum and iridium and it's called the
[1:01:46] international prototype kilogram and
[1:01:49] since 1889 every time you buy a pound of
[1:01:53] hamburger it's based on that hunk of
[1:01:55] metal over in France
[1:01:57] I didn't even know that
[1:01:59] but it's based upon that that is the
[1:02:02] absolute for measurement
[1:02:04] for for mass in the United States and
[1:02:06] the whole world until recently
[1:02:09] because they found out that even for 130
[1:02:12] something years that was the absolute
[1:02:15] but they realized that it's not the
[1:02:17] absolute
[1:02:18] because they've realized now that that
[1:02:21] it starts that matter releases little
[1:02:25] Trace Amounts little by little and it's
[1:02:28] taken 130 years but that that what they
[1:02:31] call the Big K the kilogram has now lost
[1:02:34] the amount of mass that'll equal about
[1:02:36] your eyelash
[1:02:38] in 130 years
[1:02:40] now that's pretty good
[1:02:43] but that's not perfect
[1:02:45] so what have they done they have now
[1:02:48] based it upon quantum physics and
[1:02:50] quantum mechanics and they've left off
[1:02:52] the Earth and they've gone into the
[1:02:54] atmospheres they've gone into the
[1:02:55] universe where they're getting their
[1:02:57] measurement from I'm like well they
[1:02:59] could have done that a long time ago
[1:03:01] see
[1:03:02] because even now they're realizing that
[1:03:04] nothing on this Earth nothing in the
[1:03:07] natural world lasts forever
[1:03:09] not one thing
[1:03:12] and the way they measure it now is by
[1:03:15] how fast it depletes
[1:03:18] because that now they know that it's
[1:03:20] gonna deplete and they can anticipate
[1:03:23] the depletion and they've got that down
[1:03:25] to a science
[1:03:26] and it starts with a decimal point and
[1:03:29] 33 zeros behind it then it starts with a
[1:03:33] number
[1:03:34] now that's somebody's got a whole lot
[1:03:36] more time than I do
[1:03:38] to try to figure out if I'm going to get
[1:03:40] a good deal on my hamburger or not
[1:03:44] but we've got to have a uh an absolute
[1:03:46] somewhere
[1:03:48] and if we try and and they even said
[1:03:50] that I remember reading this that back
[1:03:52] in the old days that if a a vehicle ever
[1:03:55] got up to the great speed of 30 miles an
[1:03:58] hour that it would leave the Earth and
[1:04:00] fly off into space that's what they
[1:04:02] believed boy have they proven that wrong
[1:04:05] and all the time science books are being
[1:04:08] proven every day they're having to go
[1:04:10] back and rewrite it and rewrite it all
[1:04:12] the things that we used to hold
[1:04:15] um as the absolute are no longer you
[1:04:18] know governments are falling things that
[1:04:21] the the foundations of our very
[1:04:23] government is being washed out from
[1:04:25] under
[1:04:26] we can see wave after wave of of of the
[1:04:30] of the the Communists and the and it
[1:04:33] started if you go all the way back
[1:04:35] you've got to go back and I remember
[1:04:36] talking the other day about how that
[1:04:38] women first started bobbing their hair
[1:04:39] off in the 20s that was right after
[1:04:41] World War One
[1:04:45] and how that it started that Spirit of
[1:04:48] rebellion
[1:04:49] and that was a spirit of rebellion on
[1:04:51] the on the woman's part that she didn't
[1:04:53] want to be under the headship of a man
[1:04:55] anymore it was a women's lib movement
[1:04:58] and they were smoke like bro oh brother
[1:05:00] Branham hated it he said I'd rather see
[1:05:02] my wife drunk on the floor than smoking
[1:05:04] a cigarette but that was part of that
[1:05:06] women's Liberation they got the vote
[1:05:08] they wanted to vote and be just like the
[1:05:10] man have all the things but it was a
[1:05:12] spirit of rebellion that was upon them
[1:05:14] not wanting to be under the subjection
[1:05:17] of a man or a husband or what they
[1:05:20] called the patriarchal society
[1:05:24] and that so it started in the I would
[1:05:27] say farther back then the brother was
[1:05:29] talking the other night about all the
[1:05:31] different changes even from the 1800s
[1:05:33] and and uh and coming on up into the
[1:05:36] philosophies and and now we've then we
[1:05:38] came up into you know you had Karl Marx
[1:05:41] and different ones and everybody had a
[1:05:42] better idea for a society
[1:05:44] and and so so in the 20s it started but
[1:05:48] there's a funny thing that happened in
[1:05:49] 1928.
[1:05:51] and this was in Germany
[1:05:53] does anybody know what happened in 1928
[1:05:55] in Germany
[1:05:57] it was the invention the invention of
[1:05:59] the magnetic tape recorder
[1:06:02] that the rest of the world knew nothing
[1:06:03] about
[1:06:04] but the Germans had it it was top secret
[1:06:06] and nobody knew about it
[1:06:09] and the rest of the world didn't even
[1:06:11] have it the Germans had it and then the
[1:06:13] war started and then we was in the midst
[1:06:16] of the war and then not until after the
[1:06:18] war
[1:06:19] did the United States get its hand upon
[1:06:22] it because they went in and they and
[1:06:23] they took the bunkers and they took the
[1:06:25] headquarters and they found the
[1:06:26] machinery and they found the tape
[1:06:28] recorders and they found the equipment
[1:06:30] and brought it back to the United States
[1:06:33] so tonight
[1:06:35] we have the ability to hear the very
[1:06:37] voice of God through our prophet
[1:06:40] courtesy of Nazi Germany amen
[1:06:44] oh I love how God does things he's the
[1:06:47] unchanging God but he comes in
[1:06:49] unexpected ways
[1:06:51] amen do you believe that the
[1:06:53] unchangeable god
[1:06:55] but uh you go back and I don't mean to
[1:06:57] yell and bust your eardrums if I do just
[1:06:59] say Hey Brother
[1:07:01] come on brother but I preach at the
[1:07:03] other church and can't nobody hear me
[1:07:04] over there so after church I had a
[1:07:07] brother he's like brother can you speak
[1:07:09] a little louder
[1:07:11] I'm like oh you you think I need to
[1:07:13] speak a little louder okay
[1:07:15] all right well praise the Lord
[1:07:17] I'll try
[1:07:20] but that Spirit of rebellion
[1:07:24] that got started back there
[1:07:26] and and we know that it's a spirit
[1:07:29] because it came on up and into the into
[1:07:32] the 20s and the 30s and you had the
[1:07:34] music and started off with the with the
[1:07:36] Ragtime
[1:07:37] oh it was kind it was harmless
[1:07:40] but it had a little striptease that went
[1:07:42] with it and the little little dance of
[1:07:44] the woman little Ragtime music get out
[1:07:46] and do the Charleston or whatever they
[1:07:47] did back then it was synonymous with the
[1:07:49] with the prohibition and the drinking
[1:07:51] the liquor and all these things like
[1:07:53] that
[1:07:54] and then from there it came on up to
[1:07:56] Jazz and then that was a little more
[1:07:59] seductive and they and they would have
[1:08:01] the the dances and the fan dancers and
[1:08:03] the different things like that and you
[1:08:05] see where this progression is going our
[1:08:08] society is getting a little bit more but
[1:08:10] the but the culture is going down
[1:08:11] science is going up culture goes down
[1:08:15] and so we know it's a spirit because in
[1:08:17] the what was it the 40s or 50s you had
[1:08:19] James Dean and he made a movie called
[1:08:22] Rebel Without a Cause
[1:08:23] he was just a rebel to be a rebel
[1:08:26] and and so that just tells you that was
[1:08:29] that Spirit of rebellion and it came
[1:08:31] through the rock and roll music it came
[1:08:33] up and it changed the culture of the
[1:08:35] United States and the world forever
[1:08:38] and so we see now we come all the way up
[1:08:40] from the 50s and the 60s and now you see
[1:08:43] what we've got now
[1:08:45] it's a conglomeration of just oh my
[1:08:48] and now we've got the Millennials and
[1:08:49] the different ones and this is happening
[1:08:51] every generation I'm sure that is as you
[1:08:53] get older
[1:08:54] um everybody wants to blame the
[1:08:57] generation before them for all their
[1:08:59] problems now
[1:09:01] the young people say well it's because
[1:09:03] my daddy did this there was a movie that
[1:09:05] came out back in the 80s and I I saw it
[1:09:08] years ago back then but I went back and
[1:09:10] watched it a few years ago and it was
[1:09:13] called The Breakfast Club and on this
[1:09:15] movie every kid on that movie was mad at
[1:09:20] their mama and daddy and all they blamed
[1:09:23] all of their problems on everything that
[1:09:26] their dad had done or their mom had done
[1:09:28] and that was a spirit of the age and
[1:09:31] where that was coming up and now we've
[1:09:33] seen it in full manifestation
[1:09:36] and so that just tells you about where
[1:09:38] everybody's at where the where the um
[1:09:41] where the cultures at it's not taking
[1:09:43] responsibility for your own actions it's
[1:09:46] not it's not saying well I've done this
[1:09:48] so now I've got to pay the consequences
[1:09:50] no I did this but it's because it's your
[1:09:53] fault that I'm in this shape that I'm in
[1:09:55] now
[1:09:56] see that's the spirit of this age nobody
[1:09:59] wants to take
[1:10:00] um responsibility
[1:10:03] amen
[1:10:04] and we see how that it comes and the
[1:10:06] Satan comes in and waves but then as a
[1:10:09] wave comes in the wave will recede
[1:10:11] you'll have a tide of Communism and then
[1:10:13] the conservatives will come in and then
[1:10:15] it'll come back a little harder in the
[1:10:16] 60s then he'll go back out and all the
[1:10:19] while just like a wave on the beaches is
[1:10:22] washing out the foundation of a of a
[1:10:25] home out there or it's washing out the
[1:10:27] road or a bridge little by little wave
[1:10:29] after wave and it goes back and you say
[1:10:32] oh well that's one wave it's it's okay
[1:10:34] the bridge is still here I'm all right
[1:10:36] the house is still here but another wave
[1:10:38] comes in and then another wave will come
[1:10:41] in and now the very foundations of our
[1:10:44] nation are being attacked they've torn
[1:10:47] down statues well they had the
[1:10:48] low-hanging fruit that was easy to go
[1:10:50] after the Confederate sort of go after
[1:10:52] Stonewall Jackson or go after Robert E
[1:10:54] Lee and everybody's a whole yeah that's
[1:10:57] fine I don't have a problem with that
[1:10:58] but now they're going after Thomas
[1:10:59] Jefferson they're going after Abraham
[1:11:01] Lincoln they're going after George
[1:11:03] Washington the very foundations of the
[1:11:06] nation are being stripped out from under
[1:11:08] the people
[1:11:09] and and so now everybody's saying wait a
[1:11:12] minute hold on just a second but now see
[1:11:14] it's already in motion so what are you
[1:11:16] going to do about it see
[1:11:18] so folks they say well I've got an exit
[1:11:21] strategy I'm going to do this or I'm
[1:11:23] going to do that or we need a we need
[1:11:25] Donald Trump back in there or we need
[1:11:27] Ron DeSantis or we need JFK Jr or
[1:11:30] whoever he is I don't know Robert who is
[1:11:31] that some other Kennedy I don't know
[1:11:33] that's all we need is another one
[1:11:36] and everybody's looking for that to be
[1:11:38] the answer
[1:11:40] oh we need a savior we need a somebody
[1:11:42] to stand up and rescue us
[1:11:45] you know the Democrat the Republicans
[1:11:47] want a good uh a good retort you know
[1:11:49] the Democrats are always coming in with
[1:11:51] with a wave of of of some kind of
[1:11:55] liberalism or some kind of attack
[1:11:56] against against conservative values
[1:11:59] against the family against the home and
[1:12:02] what the conservatives want is they want
[1:12:04] a Superman politician who can stand and
[1:12:07] go toe-to-toe with them and get the
[1:12:09] media to finally get on their side
[1:12:11] it's never going to happen
[1:12:14] never going to happen
[1:12:16] but you know that's a smoke screen that
[1:12:18] Satan's got
[1:12:19] for the entire world
[1:12:22] brother Brandon all it is is communism
[1:12:23] brother bam said don't you worry about
[1:12:26] communism
[1:12:27] see while we're over here worried about
[1:12:30] uh who hit John or or whatever's going
[1:12:33] on over here and some kind of a new bill
[1:12:36] that they're coming out with and they're
[1:12:37] getting you all tore up and you're
[1:12:39] watching the news and and you're
[1:12:40] fighting your fingernails watching
[1:12:41] Tucker Carlson or biting your
[1:12:43] fingernails and watching Fox News oh
[1:12:44] what are we going to do what are we
[1:12:46] going to do is that they've got they're
[1:12:48] coming for the guns or well we know they
[1:12:50] are what are you getting all upset about
[1:12:51] prophets already said it
[1:12:54] why in the world are we worried about
[1:12:56] these things
[1:12:57] getting all upset about these things but
[1:13:00] while the whole world is biting their
[1:13:02] fingernails wondering what are we going
[1:13:03] to do Rome's over here sharpening up
[1:13:06] their knives see
[1:13:07] brother Ram said don't worry about
[1:13:09] communism worry about romanism
[1:13:12] well I don't worry about him he said
[1:13:13] watch them look out for him
[1:13:16] that purple Beast over there amen
[1:13:18] Scarlet Beast
[1:13:20] she's getting power again
[1:13:22] you don't think so you
[1:13:25] just look around
[1:13:27] for the first time in hundreds and
[1:13:30] hundreds of years Switzerland is no
[1:13:32] longer neutral
[1:13:33] they've always been neutral in every
[1:13:35] conflict
[1:13:36] always been neutral except for this one
[1:13:40] they're no longer neutral they they
[1:13:42] absolutely froze the bank accounts of
[1:13:44] Russia
[1:13:45] how many knows that that happened sure
[1:13:48] they've always touted us oh no we're out
[1:13:50] of it we're out of it hmm
[1:13:53] you know it's kind of a funny thing has
[1:13:55] anybody ever noticed their Swiss guards
[1:13:57] that guard the Vatican
[1:14:00] see there's a there's things that are
[1:14:02] going on in this world that the devil's
[1:14:04] got everybody running after this and
[1:14:06] he's got you running after that and it's
[1:14:08] right under you nose you're not even
[1:14:10] seeing it
[1:14:12] but I'm so God I'm glad that the
[1:14:14] unchangeable god
[1:14:16] has came to us in an unexpectable way
[1:14:20] amen
[1:14:22] we don't have to worry about these
[1:14:23] things my goodness how long have I been
[1:14:24] up here already
[1:14:27] somebody tell me what time I started
[1:14:28] anybody gone
[1:14:33] praise the Lord
[1:14:37] see that's what's the matter today
[1:14:38] reason our schools are letting down no
[1:14:40] ministers coming in
[1:14:42] see oh we don't need preachers anymore
[1:14:46] this is 1962.
[1:14:48] no ministers coming in young men
[1:14:50] interested we have needs some more of
[1:14:53] you praying fathers and mothers is what
[1:14:54] we need to make our schools fill up
[1:14:56] young men's Hearts burning with Zeal to
[1:14:59] take the gospel is what we need
[1:15:01] but things are changing see brother
[1:15:03] Brown said that we need young man whose
[1:15:06] hearts are on fire
[1:15:08] young man who's who's got a zeal
[1:15:11] for the gospel
[1:15:13] oh I would I would that every young man
[1:15:16] every young woman that would come in
[1:15:18] every person that would come in
[1:15:21] to this church
[1:15:22] on Wednesday night on Sunday morning
[1:15:26] but you would come for one purpose in
[1:15:28] one person one purpose alone
[1:15:31] and that was to come and worship our
[1:15:34] heavenly father
[1:15:36] I don't mean just show up
[1:15:38] right I don't mean half-heartedly clap
[1:15:40] your hands
[1:15:42] come and warm this seat for an hour and
[1:15:44] a half or two hours
[1:15:45] I don't mean coming and be entertained
[1:15:47] by the music or come and be entertained
[1:15:50] by What speaker is here
[1:15:53] but come with a purpose in your life
[1:15:57] oh my
[1:15:59] god brother Jason preached a sermon
[1:16:01] called prayer and purpose
[1:16:03] I love it
[1:16:05] everybody's seeking after happiness
[1:16:08] oh I just want to get happy I I have a
[1:16:11] right to be happy I have a right to I
[1:16:14] want something I want new clothes I want
[1:16:15] to go shopping to make me happy I want a
[1:16:17] new car
[1:16:18] you know I want to buy a boat and a
[1:16:21] truck to pull it with that'll make me
[1:16:23] happy
[1:16:24] everything that that everybody wants to
[1:16:26] be happy
[1:16:28] but in chasing after happiness
[1:16:31] you never find it
[1:16:33] chasing after happiness is like a mirage
[1:16:37] when the Pioneers were out on the desert
[1:16:38] and they were looking for water
[1:16:40] and they would see a mirage and they
[1:16:42] kept running after it and every time
[1:16:44] they go farther it's get a little
[1:16:45] farther away and that's the way
[1:16:46] happiness is in your life when you're
[1:16:48] chasing after it
[1:16:50] but I read a quote one time I thought it
[1:16:52] was wonderful and it said this that
[1:16:54] happiness is what you stumble over on
[1:16:58] your way to serving God
[1:17:01] that's the only true happiness you'll
[1:17:04] ever find in this world
[1:17:05] you might I think you're happy for a
[1:17:07] little while you get your little bit of
[1:17:09] money in your bank account you get a new
[1:17:11] car you get a new girlfriend you get a
[1:17:14] new boyfriend
[1:17:15] you get a new job you get a new house
[1:17:18] but that old house is going to crumble
[1:17:20] one day that boyfriend might break up
[1:17:22] with you
[1:17:24] your money's gonna go that's just a
[1:17:27] given
[1:17:28] see
[1:17:30] none of those things bring happiness
[1:17:32] I've seen and read about rock stars oh
[1:17:36] they were ambitious yet they were
[1:17:38] ambitious they've ran over everybody to
[1:17:40] get they would do everything they could
[1:17:42] to get that audition in front of that
[1:17:44] right producer and they got there and
[1:17:45] boy they were they had arrived then they
[1:17:48] had sold out concerts and 50s 60 and 70
[1:17:51] and 80 000 people people just screaming
[1:17:54] just to get a a glimpse of them
[1:17:56] screaming to grab a hold of their
[1:17:58] clothes
[1:17:58] all right
[1:18:00] and absolutely took up a gun and blew
[1:18:03] their own brains out
[1:18:05] adored by the world everything at their
[1:18:08] fingertips
[1:18:10] they could have any person they wanted
[1:18:13] in a carnal way
[1:18:15] they could have anything that they want
[1:18:17] any car any house any vacation
[1:18:21] but when they got to the top of this
[1:18:23] great Mountain that Satan had up there
[1:18:26] for him when they reached to the top of
[1:18:28] it they realize there's nothing there
[1:18:30] nothing but emptiness nothing but
[1:18:33] sadness is this all that there is
[1:18:37] when they get there and they'll die
[1:18:38] they'll try to quiet that that that
[1:18:40] thirst that God put in them
[1:18:43] yes they have a thirst every man woman
[1:18:46] and child born has a thirst
[1:18:48] but we'll set him we'll we'll quiz that
[1:18:51] thirst with the things of the world
[1:18:53] rock stars will do it with drugs and
[1:18:55] they'll start saying oh I need something
[1:18:57] I need a new drug that was a drug a song
[1:18:59] back out in the 80s or 70s I need a new
[1:19:02] drug one of them won't make me feel too
[1:19:04] high one of them won't make me feel too
[1:19:06] low
[1:19:08] yeah need a new drug
[1:19:12] I'm so glad I found a drug one day
[1:19:17] oh I don't need no narcotic
[1:19:19] [Music]
[1:19:21] I drunk from that Fountain and there's
[1:19:23] something about it there's something
[1:19:25] about drinking one time from that
[1:19:27] Fountain you'll never thirst again
[1:19:28] you'll never thirst for the things of
[1:19:30] the world you'll thirst for more of God
[1:19:32] your thirst oh it makes a thirst in you
[1:19:34] that you won't be satisfied until you've
[1:19:37] got more of him
[1:19:39] don't try to quench that thirst for the
[1:19:40] things of this world it'll never work
[1:19:42] it'll only bring you heartache and
[1:19:44] sorrow
[1:19:45] that's what the world says chase after
[1:19:48] this chase after that
[1:19:51] little bit just a little bit farther
[1:19:53] until you're running all the way I saw I
[1:19:56] believe it was a image one time of a man
[1:19:58] chasing the dollar and he and it and he
[1:20:01] kept running and he got a hold and
[1:20:02] finally there was a grave and he fell
[1:20:04] right in the grave
[1:20:05] chasing the almighty dollar
[1:20:08] what's your God tonight
[1:20:11] see
[1:20:14] watching TV
[1:20:16] watching movies
[1:20:18] let me tell you something I read this a
[1:20:20] long time ago
[1:20:21] television makes you want things you
[1:20:24] can't have
[1:20:26] and it makes you dissatisfied with what
[1:20:28] you do have
[1:20:31] think about it let me say that again it
[1:20:33] makes you want things you can't have
[1:20:35] and dissatisfied with what you do have
[1:20:39] if you're married if you're a man and
[1:20:41] you got a wife and you see a beautiful
[1:20:42] woman on there and she's seductive it'll
[1:20:45] cause a man to want that covetousness
[1:20:48] if a woman sees a man on there come on
[1:20:51] now y'all with me
[1:20:53] help me preach tonight amen
[1:20:55] if a woman sees a man on there and he's
[1:20:57] handsome he's clean cut oh he carries a
[1:21:00] bouquet and comes in the door on the
[1:21:02] Hallmark Channel it's always at
[1:21:04] Christmas time and it's and as always on
[1:21:06] a horse farm somewhere
[1:21:10] and his name is Gage or Luke or
[1:21:12] something like that
[1:21:15] oh but he's romantic see
[1:21:19] just like the devil was to Eve
[1:21:21] romantic
[1:21:23] you see what that does
[1:21:25] that makes that woman dissatisfied with
[1:21:28] her husband
[1:21:29] it makes her want what she can't have
[1:21:32] and the man well he's just dumb you know
[1:21:36] we're dumb anyway
[1:21:37] because all we gotta do is see something
[1:21:38] and that's it you don't have to hear
[1:21:40] nothing you don't have to no no a man is
[1:21:43] attracted by what he sees and we know
[1:21:45] that
[1:21:46] that's why it's so important young girls
[1:21:48] young ladies young women
[1:21:51] to be conscious of what you're wearing
[1:21:55] always remember that because we are made
[1:21:58] different men and women are made
[1:22:00] different
[1:22:02] women are attracted by a lot of times
[1:22:03] what they hear and and they and they're
[1:22:06] attracted to that but men are made
[1:22:10] different
[1:22:11] we're we are it's just a fact of of
[1:22:14] nature and so you've got to be conscious
[1:22:17] is your shirt too tight across the top
[1:22:19] is your skirt too tight you might have a
[1:22:22] skirt on but brother Brown said all
[1:22:24] these Pentecostal women with these
[1:22:26] dresses on it look like skin down
[1:22:28] wieners
[1:22:29] now that's what he said
[1:22:32] now what he meant by that was it's so
[1:22:34] tight you can't even tell where the
[1:22:35] where the the skin of the wiener starts
[1:22:37] and the wiener starts
[1:22:42] and that's about the size of it
[1:22:47] and you
[1:22:49] get a drink of water on them
[1:22:54] oh my
[1:22:58] God if you got a dime in your back
[1:23:00] pocket I don't want to be able to read
[1:23:01] the date on it
[1:23:08] but that's the spirit of this age
[1:23:10] you see him out in in yoga pants I'll
[1:23:13] guarantee you eight probably one percent
[1:23:15] of them doing yoga but they out there in
[1:23:18] them yoga pants
[1:23:19] for everybody to see
[1:23:22] and you ain't even got to even think
[1:23:24] about leave nothing to the imagination
[1:23:27] it don't even leave a thought left
[1:23:29] you gotta turn your head
[1:23:32] going into the store
[1:23:34] we don't have to we don't want to do
[1:23:36] that in the Church of God
[1:23:39] all we ought to look different
[1:23:41] we don't want to even ever get close to
[1:23:44] the world
[1:23:45] look nothing like the world
[1:23:48] all that all that I wouldn't care laugh
[1:23:51] at me mock me call me a Holy Roller call
[1:23:55] me whatever you want to comment and you
[1:23:57] don't have to dress out of an antique
[1:23:58] box brother Bram said you don't
[1:24:00] but you can dress modest
[1:24:02] ain't nothing wrong with that
[1:24:04] wear that badge I told the sisters up at
[1:24:06] the other church I said you sisters have
[1:24:08] a y'all have a wonderful opportunity
[1:24:10] people can see you in your long dress
[1:24:12] and your long hair and they immediately
[1:24:14] know your holiness
[1:24:17] they gotta hear us talk for a little
[1:24:20] while don't they
[1:24:21] most of us some of us the jury's still
[1:24:24] out on
[1:24:26] when you hear them talk
[1:24:28] because all it's about is Nascar or it's
[1:24:31] about this or about that
[1:24:33] and if you tied them down you might get
[1:24:35] them to admit that they're a Christian
[1:24:41] let our conversations be holy
[1:24:45] let our dress be holy oh God
[1:24:49] let our thoughts be holy
[1:24:51] I love what brother Jason said Sunday
[1:24:53] what his daddy told him
[1:24:54] any evil thought you bring that thing
[1:24:57] before the Holy Ghost and let him kill
[1:24:59] it
[1:25:00] I did that this week I told Brother
[1:25:02] Jason back in the study I've done it
[1:25:04] probably 10 times already and a thought
[1:25:06] well come in you know what I would do I
[1:25:08] would picture that thought as an old
[1:25:10] greasy hobo
[1:25:13] I don't know why
[1:25:15] poor hobo but just an old grimy nasty
[1:25:19] looking something
[1:25:21] and he and he comes up and I put
[1:25:23] handcuffs on him Paul said take that
[1:25:26] thing into captivity I'm putting
[1:25:27] handcuffs of the of the of the word of
[1:25:29] God on that thing and in my mind I'm
[1:25:32] leading it up here I'll say come on you
[1:25:33] coming with me and there's this jail
[1:25:35] cell over here and then that cell is a
[1:25:37] pillar of fire of the Holy Ghost and I
[1:25:39] put that thing in that cell brothers and
[1:25:41] sisters that thing is gone
[1:25:43] do that try it one time and see what
[1:25:45] happens
[1:25:47] bring it to the Holy Ghost and let him
[1:25:48] burn it out
[1:25:50] to make that concerted effort in your
[1:25:52] heart
[1:25:54] burn it out I don't want none of that in
[1:25:57] my heart
[1:25:58] only thing that's waiting for the
[1:26:01] Rapture is the Readiness of the church
[1:26:04] you say oh you're preaching clothesline
[1:26:05] you're preaching this I believe in
[1:26:07] holiness
[1:26:08] [Applause]
[1:26:09] we ought to all believe in holiness
[1:26:13] God is a holy God
[1:26:15] and he's going to have a holy church
[1:26:18] she won't have one spot or wrinkle
[1:26:21] she's not going to have a stitch of the
[1:26:22] world she's not going to have any of the
[1:26:24] suit of Hell upon her
[1:26:27] none of it
[1:26:29] she's going to be a spotless bride
[1:26:32] well we know we need to know what time
[1:26:33] it is because there's one thing that
[1:26:35] when a bride's getting ready there's one
[1:26:37] thing she's looking at the Bridesmaids
[1:26:39] are here it's fine all the other ones
[1:26:41] here but there's one thing she's looking
[1:26:42] at is that clock
[1:26:43] she's waiting waiting for time to go out
[1:26:47] and be married to her groom
[1:26:49] we need to know what time it is
[1:26:52] so already I believe it's already it's
[1:26:54] already almost midnight
[1:26:56] I think the second hand's already almost
[1:26:58] hit there in a minute it's just one one
[1:27:00] click away
[1:27:02] nations are breaking as brother Brandon
[1:27:04] would say many times Israel's Awakening
[1:27:06] the signs that the prophet's foretold
[1:27:09] we're at the end
[1:27:11] it's time to quit playing Church
[1:27:15] oh my
[1:27:17] let me get one more Amen on that one
[1:27:19] time to quit playing Church
[1:27:21] kind of get down to the brass tacks
[1:27:24] brother Brown I'm tired on the way back
[1:27:26] how do we go back it ain't some Doctrine
[1:27:29] it ain't some Dogma it ain't some Creed
[1:27:32] we got to have that love in our heart
[1:27:34] for our brothers and sisters
[1:27:36] amen
[1:27:37] amen
[1:27:39] well I've got one quote read already
[1:27:43] oh my this is gonna be one for the
[1:27:45] record books here
[1:27:48] but God he cannot change his decisions
[1:27:50] he cannot change it therefore if God's
[1:27:53] attitude toward one Sinner and wanted to
[1:27:56] repent Adam and Eve God made a way for
[1:27:58] them to repent and he forgave that
[1:28:01] Sinner and the next sinner comes God has
[1:28:03] got to do the same thing to that sinner
[1:28:05] or he did it wrong when he acted with
[1:28:06] the first sinner if a man was sick and
[1:28:08] God healed one man and then if ever
[1:28:11] another man comes to God he's got to do
[1:28:13] the same thing or he did it wrong when
[1:28:14] he healed the first one if he comes on
[1:28:16] the same ground what a resting place
[1:28:18] then for the soul that's seeking are you
[1:28:21] seeking him tonight
[1:28:23] we've got a resting place it's the
[1:28:25] unchangeable god it's not politics it's
[1:28:29] not money it's not any of these things
[1:28:31] out there it ain't even your brother and
[1:28:33] your sister that they'll make mistakes
[1:28:35] it ain't brother Jason he's he's he can
[1:28:37] fall just like anybody else but get your
[1:28:39] eyes on Jesus Christ amen
[1:28:42] the unchanging God
[1:28:45] sometimes it comes in unexpected ways
[1:28:47] The ecumenical World thought that he was
[1:28:49] going to come in in one of their
[1:28:51] denominations maybe maybe the Baptist
[1:28:53] thought he was going to rise up or the
[1:28:54] methodists or with a with a uh messenger
[1:28:58] that Wesley had or the Baptist that John
[1:29:01] Smith or or Campbell had
[1:29:03] see
[1:29:04] but he ain't coming any of those ways
[1:29:07] now I'm so glad that he came just like
[1:29:09] he did
[1:29:10] oh a little uneducated man
[1:29:13] from the middle of the country way back
[1:29:15] up in the woods I tell you what the
[1:29:17] world don't want him but I'll take him
[1:29:19] well I want a part of him but I'll take
[1:29:21] him
[1:29:23] I believe this message I believe is
[1:29:25] absolutely a perfect message
[1:29:29] 47 to 65.
[1:29:32] oh mama here's a promise too that we can
[1:29:34] think if he the one that said that has
[1:29:37] brought every word to pass then he's
[1:29:39] going to have a church to appear before
[1:29:41] him without a spotter wrinkle and it's
[1:29:44] going to behoove us brother sister to
[1:29:46] really be sure that we are right with
[1:29:48] God and then because there's going to be
[1:29:50] a church and we want to be part of that
[1:29:52] church amen that's the unchanging God
[1:29:55] hey man we want to be part of that
[1:29:56] church don't we I don't want to be a
[1:29:58] part of the church if anything goes I
[1:30:00] don't want to be as part of the Church
[1:30:01] of well we're known for our great music
[1:30:03] or we're known because we have a
[1:30:04] wonderful speaker and he just keeps your
[1:30:06] attention all the time but I want to be
[1:30:08] known oh brother Bram talked about a
[1:30:10] church out in I believe it's somewhere
[1:30:12] out in California maybe San Jose called
[1:30:13] the old Powerhouse is what he called it
[1:30:16] he said that that they were really
[1:30:18] praying people
[1:30:20] oh they were they he said that he came
[1:30:22] in one time and his wife was with him
[1:30:24] and they were singing a song and he
[1:30:27] heard it sounded like somebody was
[1:30:28] singing above them and it was angels
[1:30:31] well if he asked the brother afterwards
[1:30:34] the pastor of Church he said I sounded
[1:30:35] something High train voices and the
[1:30:38] brother said oh brother Brown that
[1:30:40] happens here often said that that they
[1:30:43] would come in and they would pray all
[1:30:45] night seeking God and then and that and
[1:30:48] that was like I believe that was a
[1:30:49] window of Heaven that was open in that
[1:30:51] little place
[1:30:52] oh I wish that Bethel Tabernacle was
[1:30:55] like that
[1:30:56] I want the world to say write about
[1:30:58] Bethel Tabernacle in Beaufort South
[1:31:00] Carolina
[1:31:01] it might have been a little but it was a
[1:31:03] Powerhouse
[1:31:04] why it wasn't nothing to do with the
[1:31:06] four walls wasn't nothing to do the
[1:31:07] lighting or the sound but it was a
[1:31:09] living God living in the people they
[1:31:12] came to church expecting something and
[1:31:15] wouldn't leave until they got it
[1:31:18] a lot of times we don't stay long enough
[1:31:19] we don't pray long enough we get out for
[1:31:22] just a little while and brother random
[1:31:24] saying when you get down and you start
[1:31:25] feeling the phone starts ringing or this
[1:31:27] starts happening or the or he said the
[1:31:29] birds will aggravate me or the stickers
[1:31:31] will stick me he said hold on he said
[1:31:33] God's getting ready to do something he
[1:31:35] comes in unexpected ways sometimes you
[1:31:38] don't know we think oh he's going to
[1:31:40] come in a Revival glory be to God but it
[1:31:43] might be on Monday morning it might be
[1:31:45] uh when you're doing your laundry
[1:31:47] sisters or brothers or you might be when
[1:31:50] you're on the road somewhere and you put
[1:31:52] on a tape or maybe you start thinking
[1:31:54] about something to happen or you're on
[1:31:55] the phone with another brother or
[1:31:57] another sister or something and
[1:31:58] something comes and oh praise be to God
[1:32:01] that Revelation strikes your heart
[1:32:03] I've been going down the road and just
[1:32:05] about stomped a hole in my floorboard
[1:32:06] before
[1:32:08] they say as a crazy man over there just
[1:32:10] leave me alone
[1:32:11] I'll be crazy
[1:32:15] I tell you what I hope the world calls
[1:32:17] me crazy because if they think I'm like
[1:32:19] them oh I'm in trouble
[1:32:21] I don't want to look nothing like them
[1:32:22] do you
[1:32:25] oh my
[1:32:27] God now we don't have to be odd
[1:32:28] but you'll be odd you don't have to make
[1:32:31] yourself odd
[1:32:33] you just get in love with him get it all
[1:32:35] over you
[1:32:36] don't worry about what this one says
[1:32:39] don't worry about what you're the person
[1:32:41] beside of you says
[1:32:42] but just get it all over you amen
[1:32:46] all right getting ready to close here
[1:32:49] I mean it now let's take Jacob
[1:32:52] now you remember okay
[1:32:54] now you must remember also that when God
[1:32:56] answers sometimes it's in an unexpected
[1:32:59] way he's unchangeable but he does things
[1:33:01] in unexpected ways let's take Jacob
[1:33:04] Jacob was running he got caught between
[1:33:06] two fires now he was going home and
[1:33:09] Laban his father-in-law was coming this
[1:33:11] way after him because his wife had stole
[1:33:14] their gods and then he finds out that
[1:33:16] Esau is coming this way after his
[1:33:19] brother who he had cheated now that was
[1:33:21] quite an unexpected time for God to
[1:33:23] visit him
[1:33:25] you thought it would have been in the
[1:33:26] middle of a Revival or something oh no
[1:33:28] it was in the middle of the one of the
[1:33:30] hardest times of his life
[1:33:31] sometimes God brings us down right down
[1:33:33] to the river he'll bring us right down
[1:33:36] to the very brink of it I've been there
[1:33:38] I felt like everything was going to fall
[1:33:40] apart I and just oh I've been I've I've
[1:33:43] tasted of this heavenly gift long enough
[1:33:46] to know that when everything looks like
[1:33:48] he's about to bust wide open it is God's
[1:33:50] getting ready to Break Forth on you
[1:33:52] you just hold home just a little bit
[1:33:54] longer don't you worry about it I've
[1:33:56] seen it too many times I've said the
[1:33:58] devil said oh it's time to give a whole
[1:34:00] no devil it's just time now you say give
[1:34:02] up I ain't giving up I ain't turning
[1:34:04] around
[1:34:05] by the grace of God I'll wear a shining
[1:34:08] Crown someday not turning round but oh
[1:34:11] he'll get you he'll get you your
[1:34:13] somebody make the boss mad at you he'll
[1:34:15] get this man he'll the dishwasher'll
[1:34:17] break the sewer is going to back up
[1:34:19] something's going to happen the car is
[1:34:20] going to break down something's going to
[1:34:22] happen and then oh it's terminal and you
[1:34:25] just feel it pressing just hold on God's
[1:34:27] fixing to do something
[1:34:29] the devil knows it I don't know how he
[1:34:31] knows it but he knows it and he tries
[1:34:33] every way he can to cut that off from
[1:34:35] you
[1:34:36] he tried with he tried with Jacob but
[1:34:39] Jacob found him a little spot he got
[1:34:41] over and all of a sudden the man came to
[1:34:43] him
[1:34:44] he started wrestling with that man that
[1:34:46] man was none other than God himself
[1:34:49] wrestle with that angel all night in the
[1:34:50] angel of the Lord
[1:34:52] and it got it was all coming on the
[1:34:54] morning it was the darkest time of the
[1:34:55] night but the sun started coming up see
[1:34:59] we're in the dark time right now
[1:35:02] and let me tell you something brother
[1:35:04] Brandon said this he said what causes it
[1:35:06] to get so dark he said it's the light
[1:35:08] that's pressing the darkness
[1:35:10] and what is it the light of God is
[1:35:12] coming
[1:35:13] let me tell you something brothers and
[1:35:15] sisters the light of God is in you you
[1:35:17] and I are causing this Darkness out
[1:35:19] there
[1:35:20] you say Brothers how in the world think
[1:35:22] about it God in you living in you
[1:35:24] written Epistles rid of all men the
[1:35:27] light of God in this Earth the only
[1:35:29] light that God has is you
[1:35:31] they're not they're not out there in
[1:35:32] that communical world they've got their
[1:35:34] Creeds they've got their dogmas they've
[1:35:36] got their organizations their
[1:35:38] denominations but it's in this little
[1:35:40] bride
[1:35:41] that's where he's tabernacled
[1:35:43] his kingdom is you you are his kingdom
[1:35:47] and that light is pressing the darkness
[1:35:50] now the light's coming the son of man is
[1:35:53] coming he's coming one of these days
[1:35:55] he's going to break the Eastern sky is
[1:35:57] that right
[1:36:00] now let me tell you say well what does
[1:36:02] it have to do with me how does Jacob
[1:36:03] wrestling a angel have to think about it
[1:36:05] that was his flesh wrestling with God
[1:36:07] your flesh every day you've got to
[1:36:10] wrestle with this word you've got to
[1:36:12] work out your own salvation you've got
[1:36:14] to wrestle with it you might have to get
[1:36:16] down it may have to take everything out
[1:36:19] of you
[1:36:19] but somehow or another you've got to let
[1:36:22] that word overcome you
[1:36:24] it's got to overcome this flesh you've
[1:36:27] got to let it overcome somehow you've
[1:36:28] got to die just like brother Jason said
[1:36:30] about uh Sampson
[1:36:32] when he finally gave up when he finally
[1:36:35] quit fighting
[1:36:36] and he and was ready to die
[1:36:39] that's you and I we've got to die out to
[1:36:40] our own thoughts we've got to die our
[1:36:42] outs our own ideas and let the word of
[1:36:45] God and the life of God come and live in
[1:36:47] US
[1:36:47] we've got to wrestle it out it's getting
[1:36:49] dark oh but the sun's coming up it's
[1:36:52] coming up any day now
[1:36:54] one of these mornings I was talking to

[1:37:11] doing something we might be going down
[1:37:12] the road you might you're going to hear
[1:37:14] a voice one day it's going to be
[1:37:15] familiar hey man I believe that I got a
[1:37:18] quote that brother Branham said this I
[1:37:19] sent it to brother Jack you want me to

[1:37:49] living in this church
[1:37:52] it'll be so powerful that'll draw the
[1:37:55] rest of them from the grave
[1:37:58] there will be a resurrection that's what
[1:38:00] the Holy Ghost is for what is the Holy
[1:38:02] Ghost without us they cannot be made
[1:38:03] perfect they lived in one day under that

[1:38:12] perfectly living in you no no tarnish of
[1:38:16] the world no Doctrine nothing like that
[1:38:20] it's going to be an absolute perfect
[1:38:22] spotless church just like the first
[1:38:24] church right back to the Ephesian Church
[1:38:26] all the way back to a perfect church and
[1:38:30] the Holy Ghost is going to be so
[1:38:31] powerful think about it the Holy Ghost
[1:38:34] on this Earth will be so powerful that
[1:38:36] the dead Saints won't even be able to
[1:38:38] stay in the grave brother bam said it'll
[1:38:40] draw him from the grave the Holy Ghost
[1:38:43] where living in you living in me oh my
[1:38:47] we've got to get to that place
[1:38:50] if it hairlips everything I don't care
[1:38:52] what it does if it if it tears a heart
[1:38:55] off of me
[1:38:56] if it skins me down
[1:38:58] Lord let it do it
[1:39:00] if he has to get home to me for my dress
[1:39:02] and get on to me for putting a little
[1:39:04] bit of brother Rim Top by that pancake
[1:39:06] makeup and he got it talking about that
[1:39:09] and had to paint the woman said she did
[1:39:10] it to cover up pimples but then she said
[1:39:12] that she came to brother Brandon she
[1:39:14] said brother random I heard what she
[1:39:15] said she said I washed it off he said
[1:39:17] praise God sister now you're close to
[1:39:19] the kingdom of heaven
[1:39:21] you say oh I got pimples just let them
[1:39:23] shine who cares
[1:39:25] I'd rather get the Applause of God than
[1:39:28] the admiration is somebody out there
[1:39:31] cares about a pimple or an acne scar
[1:39:36] do what the prophet said
[1:39:38] oh my I'm sorry
[1:39:41] is that all right
[1:39:44] I don't want to know part of the world I
[1:39:47] don't want to look like the world I
[1:39:48] don't want to dress like the world the
[1:39:50] Hebrew children I'm just about to close
[1:39:52] now they were caught in quite a
[1:39:54] predicament too they were caught in an
[1:39:56] unexpected place where they met God for
[1:39:58] God to come to them in a fiery furnace
[1:40:01] unexpected time and an unexpected way
[1:40:03] but God is the unchangeable unchangeable
[1:40:06] God and he does things that way in
[1:40:09] unexpectable place unexpectable time
[1:40:12] amen you want to talk about it they said
[1:40:14] oh we're not going to serve your gods
[1:40:16] and God is able to deliver us but
[1:40:20] nevertheless we're not going to serve
[1:40:22] your gods
[1:40:23] what are you think you get right down to
[1:40:25] the very end of it God will meet you
[1:40:27] there every time he'll do it I've been
[1:40:30] there so many times I don't care what
[1:40:32] the devil's got in front of me what he
[1:40:34] what he's reminds me of my past whatever
[1:40:36] he's saying and he's trying to get me to
[1:40:38] knock me off the trail I'm not turning
[1:40:41] around I'm going to keep pressing on
[1:40:43] moving on why I've got a promise amen
[1:40:46] we've got that promise
[1:40:51] I'll think about Jesus how when he had
[1:40:53] the burdens he said here and Jesus was
[1:40:55] here confronting the greatest test that
[1:40:57] he ever had and guess how many ain't
[1:40:59] none of us had a Gethsemane yet
[1:41:01] lay just before him where that once and
[1:41:04] final all sufficient tests must come
[1:41:07] when the burdens of the entire world
[1:41:09] laid upon his blessed shoulder there was
[1:41:11] no one in all Heavens or Earth could
[1:41:13] ever stood it but him and to know that
[1:41:16] all of the sins of past sins and present
[1:41:18] sins and future sins rested upon this
[1:41:21] decision and it was one of the most
[1:41:23] greatest victories that Christ ever won
[1:41:25] or proved his great messiahship as when
[1:41:27] he said to God not my will thine be done
[1:41:31] that was the greatest Victory he had
[1:41:33] ever won all the Demons of Torment was
[1:41:36] around to tempt him and try him oh my
[1:41:40] how can can we truly say that in our
[1:41:43] heart Lord not my will but thine be done
[1:41:46] I wanna I want that to be in my life I
[1:41:49] don't want my will to overcome
[1:41:51] but Jesus promised that he'd send the
[1:41:53] Holy Ghost he said I'll send the
[1:41:55] comforter to you I want to tell you what
[1:41:57] the performance is here
[1:41:59] it talks about the performance God's
[1:42:02] going to perform this it's the execution
[1:42:04] of an action it's something accomplished
[1:42:06] the Fulfillment of a claim promise or a
[1:42:09] request if you believe it God's going to
[1:42:12] perform it in your life he said on the
[1:42:14] day at Pentecost this promise promise is
[1:42:17] unto you and your children and to them
[1:42:19] that are far off even as many as the
[1:42:21] Lord Our God shall call brothers and
[1:42:24] sisters that promise is still good
[1:42:25] tonight
[1:42:26] if you say brother brother Joe I've I
[1:42:29] believe I've accepted the Lord I maybe
[1:42:31] I'll I've received that justification
[1:42:33] I'm gonna tell you what justification is
[1:42:35] let me give you a real easy definition
[1:42:37] of it I was I I used to drive a truck
[1:42:40] and I was I had had electronic logs and
[1:42:44] and I went I forgot to go off duty and
[1:42:47] in electronic logs if you don't go off
[1:42:48] duty when you get up in the morning
[1:42:50] you've been on duty the whole time you
[1:42:52] were supposed to be off duty and you
[1:42:53] can't drive you can't go anywhere
[1:42:56] out there I was it was a mistake I
[1:42:59] didn't mean to do it see but I got up
[1:43:01] the next morning and I'm like I can't
[1:43:02] drive I can't go because the truck was
[1:43:04] locked you couldn't move it so I had to
[1:43:06] get on I had to call I had to make a a
[1:43:08] plea for help I was stuck I couldn't go
[1:43:12] nowhere and that's just how the devil's
[1:43:14] got you brothers and sisters he got you
[1:43:16] in a trap one time a mistake
[1:43:18] no phone if you're wrong he put that on
[1:43:20] you
[1:43:21] let me tell you something God's gonna
[1:43:23] put it right back on top of him when you
[1:43:25] repent and you've come to him and I said
[1:43:27] Lord he'll take it right away so I got
[1:43:30] the true definition of justification
[1:43:32] when I called that little lady and she
[1:43:33] said oh hang on just a minute she a
[1:43:36] little click of a button and just like
[1:43:38] that it was as though I had never done
[1:43:40] it
[1:43:42] oh my
[1:43:44] just that easy
[1:43:45] it's just that easy
[1:43:47] just as though I never even done it no
[1:43:50] record of it can't find it nobody could
[1:43:53] ever find it if you search all of the
[1:43:56] databases you would never find it it's
[1:43:58] not there
[1:43:59] and that's the same as your sin tonight
[1:44:01] no matter what the devil's trying to
[1:44:03] tell you is gone it's gone it can't be
[1:44:06] found
[1:44:07] they say some people say oh well God
[1:44:09] knows everything how can he I can
[1:44:11] remember how come God I don't care what
[1:44:13] you can remember the Bible says he can't
[1:44:15] remember
[1:44:18] we're finite he's infinite he has the
[1:44:21] ability to absolutely wipe it from
[1:44:23] record never happened
[1:44:26] what sins are you talking about Lord
[1:44:28] forgive me for what what sin
[1:44:31] there is no sin
[1:44:34] don't let the devil keep putting that on
[1:44:36] you day after day
[1:44:39] say oh I'm just trying to be humble
[1:44:41] don't be so humble that you walk over
[1:44:43] the blood of what it's done for you
[1:44:46] and never fully accept that great pardon
[1:44:49] that he's given to you
[1:44:51] I've had people that that would tell me
[1:44:53] I don't want to go up in communion I I
[1:44:55] just I don't feel like I'm I'm worthy no
[1:44:57] you ain't and you won't never be worthy
[1:45:00] I'll never be worthy nobody's ever going
[1:45:03] to be worthy
[1:45:04] I just oh you don't know what I've done
[1:45:06] no I don't know what you've done I don't
[1:45:08] care what you've done but I know what he
[1:45:09] did why don't you start looking at what
[1:45:11] he did
[1:45:13] and quit looking at what you've done
[1:45:15] [Applause]
[1:45:16] and walk up there with boldness and say
[1:45:19] Lord I know I'm I'm just a sinner but
[1:45:22] God I'm taking you with your word I've
[1:45:24] repented I believe oh God that you have
[1:45:26] taken my sins and threw them into the
[1:45:28] sea of forgetfulness now I'm walking up
[1:45:31] here by faith how are you saved you
[1:45:33] ain't saved by some book you're not
[1:45:35] saved by Church attendance
[1:45:37] you're not saved by him but but by the
[1:45:40] grace of God through faith
[1:45:42] you've got to take it by faith I said
[1:45:44] God I'm walking up there
[1:45:46] I know I'm nothing nothing in my hands I
[1:45:49] bring but oh God simply to the cross I
[1:45:52] cling and come boldly then
[1:45:55] and say oh Dell you get behind me I'm
[1:45:58] walking up there why because he said I'm
[1:46:00] forgiven he's saying my sins are gone
[1:46:03] I'm not listening to you anymore
[1:46:06] then move on walk on go you got
[1:46:10] Justified now let's walk on into
[1:46:12] sanctification
[1:46:13] let's just keep walking don't stop there
[1:46:16] don't stop until you get all the way up
[1:46:18] to the Holy Ghost
[1:46:19] and then oh my it's just miles brother
[1:46:22] random set up sky blue
[1:46:24] while we're seated in Heavenly places
[1:46:26] then
[1:46:27] in Christ Jesus
[1:46:30] hey man I was when I left Flagstaff the
[1:46:33] other day I remember hearing brother Tim
[1:46:37] uh I can't think of his name

[1:46:44] brother y'all laugh when you get up here
[1:46:46] it's a different place
[1:46:49] I couldn't even think of Mount Carmel
[1:46:51] the other day I was trying to think of
[1:46:52] everything else
[1:46:56] but I remember him talking about that
[1:46:57] and he on that song just set your wings
[1:47:01] and I flew out of Flagstaff the other
[1:47:03] day and I was thinking about that and
[1:47:05] that was the highest mountain in Arizona
[1:47:06] is right there right there by outside
[1:47:08] the motel and like 12 000 something feet
[1:47:11] and as I flew I got on that jet plane
[1:47:13] and I was looking down oh that was just
[1:47:15] like a mole hill down there I got to
[1:47:17] think about all of my problems in life
[1:47:19] what might be insurmountable that
[1:47:21] mountain I may not ever be able to climb
[1:47:23] it if you try to get up to it it might
[1:47:24] be Cliffs and Jags and you can never get
[1:47:26] over it but oh if we could just set our
[1:47:29] wings to The Winds of faith that I was
[1:47:31] sitting in that that comfortable seat
[1:47:32] semi
[1:47:34] and and air conditioned and and and I
[1:47:38] was eating me a a biscotti cookie and
[1:47:41] drinking a Coca-Cola and I got me a cup

[2:03:11] she got her healing amen amen anybody
[2:03:15] gotta take come on somebody got a
[2:03:16] testimony there you go
[2:03:22] so about a week ago I went up to
[2:03:24] Jeffersonville and it was certainly a
[2:03:27] blessing to be up there I had never been
[2:03:29] in the past and
[2:03:32] just listening to the tapes and whatnot
[2:03:36] of the prophet and the certain locations
[2:03:38] that he had been and visited and just
[2:03:41] his hometown up there and just being up
[2:03:44] there you could certainly feel the
[2:03:46] anointing up there and just how
[2:03:48] incredible
[2:03:50] certain events
[2:03:53] you can imagine them there
[2:03:54] and
[2:03:56] it was certainly a blessing to be up
[2:03:58] there I met a couple Brothers up there
[2:03:59] that I have never met before
[2:04:02] and
[2:04:05] bless them thank you Lord
[2:04:07] it's just
[2:04:11] it's incredible what God is doing
[2:04:13] and not just
[2:04:15] eternally thankful
[2:04:17] certainly thinking
[2:04:24] this is
[2:04:33] so
[2:04:34] um
[2:04:36] this was last night we were actually
[2:04:39] getting we had just finished dinner
[2:04:41] and we were we usually we have this
[2:04:44] routine where Hazel falls asleep in bed
[2:04:46] with us and then we take her to her crib
[2:04:48] well last night John was like you know
[2:04:51] she seems really really tired I'm going
[2:04:53] to go ahead and
[2:04:55] put her in her crib and let her go to
[2:04:57] sleep on her own
[2:04:59] so while he was in there getting her
[2:05:02] down I was in the kitchen and I had made
[2:05:05] some applesauce and that day and I
[2:05:08] needed to put it in a cat in a container
[2:05:11] and some of y'all been in my house now
[2:05:14] so the there's a cabinet that's to the
[2:05:19] left of our sink and up on the very top
[2:05:23] it has some Pyrex glass bowls and
[2:05:26] they're all stacked within each other
[2:05:28] and so I thought well I'll just pull
[2:05:30] those out and I usually don't have a
[2:05:31] problem with them but when I pulled it
[2:05:33] out
[2:05:34] it fell and it shattered all down our
[2:05:39] the the counter countertop and I I had a
[2:05:44] couple of scrapes from it but it
[2:05:45] actually really really scared me and
[2:05:47] John was like are you okay I'm like I'm
[2:05:49] fine I'm all right I just don't want to
[2:05:51] move and I didn't think about it until
[2:05:54] John said well thank the Lord Hazel
[2:05:57] wasn't in there because she would have
[2:05:59] been standing right there and there was
[2:06:02] so much class
[2:06:04] I mean it could have gotten her eye
[2:06:06] and our little puppy was actually in his
[2:06:09] cage so it didn't get him it just got me
[2:06:13] and didn't even really hurt me that bad
[2:06:15] so I'm just really thankful for that so
[2:06:18] I lost the applesauce but who cares so
[2:06:23] [Applause]
[2:06:30] oh my I believe one day we'll we'll be
[2:06:33] able to see all the close calls that we
[2:06:34] had you were going down the road and I
[2:06:36] moved this and so that didn't happen
[2:06:38] I've seen so many times I said oh my
[2:06:41] goodness what if this would have
[2:06:42] happened you know the Lord really
[2:06:43] protected us always amen we got time for
[2:06:46] one more anybody else

[2:07:15] or anything like that but

[2:07:22] important decisions for me living

[2:07:25] was kind of stressing about it and I was
[2:07:27] talking to them about it and just
[2:07:29] asking them to pray and stuff and it
[2:07:32] only took a day but
[2:07:33] I was really stressed about the decision
[2:07:35] I was trying to make and where I wanted
[2:07:37] to live and all that other stuff but
[2:07:39] finally came to that decision when I
[2:07:41] came to it it was you know I felt good
[2:07:43] peaceful about it and I'm praying it's
[2:07:47] going to be the best thing for me and
