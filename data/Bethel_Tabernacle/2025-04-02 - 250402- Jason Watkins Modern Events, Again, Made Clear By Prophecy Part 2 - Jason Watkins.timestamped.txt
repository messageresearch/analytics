[19:25] This world is falling apart.
[19:29] I'm so glad Jesus lives down in my
[19:33] heart.
[19:35] I'm carried away in the light of the
[19:39] day. As the world gets so dismal and
[19:43] dark,
[19:45] while the struggles and troubles
[19:47] outside,
[19:49] something is stirring inside of the
[19:52] bride.
[19:54] As the world gets so dark and it all
[19:58] falls apart, I'm glad Jesus lives down
[20:02] in my heart. Sing it again. This world
[20:06] is falling apart.
[20:08] I'm so glad Jesus lives down in my
[20:12] heart.
[20:14] I'm carried away in the light of today.
[20:19] The world gets so dismal and dark.
[20:24] While the struggles and troules outside,
[20:28] something is stirring inside of the
[20:32] bride.
[20:34] As the world gets so dark and it all
[20:37] falls apart, I'm glad Jesus lives down
[20:41] in my heart
[20:44] while living below.
[20:48] Help me here.
[20:50] Troubles and pain.
[20:53] There's murder and crime. This is the
[20:57] end time when people are going insane.
[21:03] But I found a release. My heart is at
[21:07] peace. Since the word of the hour
[21:10] settled in
[21:13] with troules untold, my anchor will hold
[21:18] to Jesus again and again. Amen.
[21:23] This world is falling apart.
[21:27] I'm so glad Jesus lives down in my
[21:31] heart.
[21:33] I'm carried away in the light of the
[21:37] day. As the world gets so dismal and
[21:41] dark,
[21:42] [Applause]
[21:43] struggles and trles outside,
[21:47] something is stirring inside of the
[21:50] bride.
[21:52] As the world gets so dark and it all
[21:56] falls apart, I'm glad Jesus lives down
[22:00] in my heart.
[22:03] They're praying for peace, for violence
[22:06] to cease while holding a gun in their
[22:10] hand.
[22:13] There's moral decay. A great falling
[22:16] away in the shape this world's in. It
[22:20] won't stand.
[22:22] Let it crumble and fall. I'm not
[22:25] bothered at all. In the cliff of the
[22:29] rock, I can't hide.
[22:32] When it all comes undone, I'm trusting
[22:36] in one who gives me his peace down
[22:40] inside.
[22:41] Oh, this world is falling apart.
[22:46] I'm so glad Jesus spins down in my
[22:50] heart.
[22:52] I'm carried away in the light of today.
[22:57] As the world gets so dismal and dark
[23:02] by the struggles and troubles outside,
[23:06] something is stirring inside of the
[23:10] bride.
[23:12] As the world gets so dark and it all
[23:15] falls apart, I'm glad Jesus lives down
[23:19] in my heart.
[23:22] [Music]
[23:24] Amen.

[23:54] in his house tonight. And we're going to
[23:56] invite you a while and got you standing
[23:58] to the third chapter, I'm sorry, the
[23:59] fourth chapter of Genesis. Man, we want
[24:02] to continue on from Sunday, the Lord
[24:04] being our helper. And I'm sure he will.
[24:08] Amen. Did you come ready to hear some
[24:10] more of his word? Oh, that was pretty
[24:13] weak. My You come to hear some more of
[24:15] his word.
[24:17] Amen. Preaching ain't half bad. Give me
[24:19] a chance.
[24:21] Amen. I know you're lovers of the word.
[24:24] Amen. And so, we want to look right to
[24:26] that this evening. This will be our
[24:29] second installment. We've started a a
[24:31] new series called Modern Events again
[24:34] made clear in prophecy. We're going to
[24:37] just a short reading and we'll let you
[24:39] be seated. Genesis chapter 4
[24:43] and we're going to catch verses 1-4. You
[24:46] got it? Say amen.
[24:47] Amen.
[24:48] And Adam knew Eve his wife, and she
[24:51] conceived and bore Cain and said, "I
[24:54] have gotten a man from the Lord." And
[24:55] she again bore his brother Abel. And
[24:58] Abel was a keeper of sheep, but Cain was
[25:01] a tiller of the ground.
[25:04] And in process of time, it came to pass
[25:07] that Cain brought forth that Cain
[25:10] brought of the fruit of the ground an
[25:13] offering unto the Lord. And Abel, he
[25:16] also brought of the firstlings of his
[25:19] flock, and of the fat thereof. And the
[25:22] Lord had respect unto Abel to his
[25:26] offering. Praise the Lord. It looks like
[25:28] Miles's going to help me preach tonight.
[25:30] Amen. Praise God. Let's pray.
[25:33] Father, we thank you for your word now
[25:36] and we ask that your anointing be here
[25:38] on both speaker and here. Lord, it's
[25:40] such a wonderful uh atmosphere of
[25:42] singing and worship. We're happy to be
[25:44] out on a midweek service. Lord, gives us
[25:46] a refilling time, Lord. Helps us to top
[25:49] off our tanks again, Father. And we want
[25:52] to just continue with the same
[25:54] instruction, Lord, that we were
[25:56] receiving Sunday. I quite enjoyed that,
[25:58] Lord. and we're looking for your
[26:00] presence tonight to carry on now in this
[26:03] in this thought and we commit it to you
[26:06] in Jesus name. Amen. God bless you
[26:08] friends. You can be seated.
[26:24] Amen.
[26:26] So, we had a little bit of a shorter
[26:28] reading tonight. We had actually backed
[26:30] up and read part of chapter three. And
[26:34] uh and because if you remember from
[26:36] Sunday, we were trying to get your your
[26:40] vision to start thinking about these
[26:43] very first opening scenes uh from the
[26:48] the the mankind in a fallen condition.
[26:52] And one of the notes that I want to make
[26:54] tonight, and I may make it again uh in
[26:56] one of the other um installments because
[26:59] it's really something that's on my heart
[27:02] that I I want to make sure that you get
[27:04] it. There's a number of things that
[27:05] we're covering and I really in these
[27:08] early times want to really make sure
[27:11] that you're catching it because what
[27:14] we're doing tonight uh Sunday tonight
[27:16] and as the Lord leads going forward,
[27:19] we're not just preaching a volley of
[27:21] sermons. We're actually tracking our our
[27:25] the family of God through the scripture
[27:28] and how many are part of the family of
[27:30] God. Now, we're tracking the dawning of
[27:34] the ages when God's family was living in
[27:38] a fallen condition. And and guess what?
[27:41] You're you're you're the last
[27:43] generation. You're the ones that are
[27:45] going to see the culmination. Oh, these
[27:49] are happy days, friends. Your future is
[27:51] bright. I say that all the time. Our
[27:53] future is bright and it's certain. And
[27:55] so, it doesn't really matter a lot of
[27:57] times what the devil does um because
[28:00] it's for him. It's already too late. And
[28:02] I love reminding him of that. Satan,
[28:04] you're already too late. It's not that
[28:07] It's not that you're almost late or
[28:08] maybe you're late, but maybe there's a
[28:10] little chance. I'm here to tell you that
[28:13] you're actually it's already too late.
[28:15] And so God has already uh per is
[28:19] perfecting a bride and we know that she
[28:21] is predestinated to not fall. I'm glad
[28:25] to be in that number because listen
[28:27] friends, if it was resting on on us, I
[28:31] don't I don't know that we would all
[28:32] have the greatest amount of confidence.
[28:34] Now, you might have it, you know, right
[28:36] when you walk out of church on Sunday,
[28:38] feel on top of the world. But then you
[28:41] come in here tonight and you say, "Man,
[28:42] I don't know. I ain't sure. Lord, speak
[28:45] to me again." And and and I just want to
[28:47] tell you something, friends, that's not
[28:49] unique to you. Preachers get like that,
[28:52] too. Come on, preachers.
[28:54] Amen. Amen. And people are waiting to
[28:56] see if you amen that. And so, uh, so,
[28:59] you know, we all we all we also have
[29:01] struggles. We're all in this thing
[29:03] together, moving right along with you.
[29:06] But we're we're wanting to make and here
[29:09] here's a point that I want to make
[29:11] tonight that it's interesting that these
[29:16] this as I said it Sunday, this act one,
[29:20] scene one. All right. Act one, scene one
[29:24] of humanity in a fallen condition. Act
[29:29] one, scene one was not a political
[29:32] rally.
[29:34] Wasn't a wasn't a business conference.
[29:39] Amen. It wasn't a sporting event. It it
[29:43] it it it wasn't uh it wasn't even a a
[29:47] consumer electronics show, which I love
[29:49] to go to. wasn't a gunshot. Wasn't any
[29:52] of those things. The the scene one, act
[29:55] one, opens with a church service.
[29:58] Here are two men going to church and
[30:02] they're actually coming to worship
[30:05] because after all, that's why we come to
[30:08] church,
[30:09] right? We're not here just to gain
[30:11] knowledge, gain theology. We're not here
[30:13] because it's a social gathering. Uh
[30:16] there there's there's ways to social
[30:18] gather without having to get all dressed
[30:21] up and and drive halfway across town. I
[30:24] mean, you know, there if it's just a
[30:26] social gathering, there there's superior
[30:28] ideas than than bringing families out in
[30:31] the middle of the week and men are tired
[30:33] from work and kids have been in school
[30:35] and wives are are busy and and tired and
[30:38] but you know, we're here because we
[30:40] believe there's value in it. We believe
[30:43] that to come to the house of God and to
[30:46] worship our creator in by uh agreeing
[30:50] with his word is the is the greatest
[30:52] worship he can receive. Do you realize
[30:55] how many billions of people in the name
[30:59] of Christianity
[31:01] worship God, but it's worship in vain.
[31:06] Now, I'm not the, you know, the the the
[31:10] the old troll under a bridge who's
[31:12] ruining everybody's day in saying that.
[31:15] That's what Jesus said. That that in
[31:18] vain do they worship me. He's quoting an
[31:21] Old Testament prophet. In vain do they
[31:23] worship me. And here's why. He's not
[31:25] saying they don't sing songs. He's not
[31:27] saying they don't clap their hands. is
[31:29] not saying they don't open Bibles or
[31:31] gather around or uh speak the name of
[31:33] Jesus and lift up voices and raise hands
[31:37] and cry out real tears. He's not saying
[31:40] they don't do that. He's saying that all
[31:43] of it is based on the fundamental uh the
[31:47] absolute fundamental foundation that
[31:49] they are not believing all of his word
[31:54] and that and that they they teach for
[31:56] doctrine because they got to teach
[31:58] something. The people are coming
[32:00] expecting to hear something. Did you
[32:01] come expecting to hear something
[32:03] tonight? Well, then we got to have
[32:04] something to say. And the last thing
[32:06] that I would want to give you and I
[32:09] would hope it would be the very last
[32:11] thing you would be satisfied to receive
[32:14] is just doctrines of men. I want the
[32:17] living and grafted word of God anointed
[32:20] and inspired
[32:23] because I want it to effect change in my
[32:27] life. I'm not here to leave the same or
[32:30] worse. I want to improve. That's why
[32:33] we're here.
[32:35] So the very first thing was a church
[32:38] service and I as a reminder friends
[32:41] remember that in this series this is not
[32:44] we're not we're not what we're not doing
[32:46] is a verse byvere study of the entire
[32:49] book of revelation and as such we're
[32:51] going to be bouncing around the whole
[32:54] book uh the whole book of revelation
[32:56] along with other books like Genesis and
[32:58] Daniel and Ezekiel and I'm putting
[33:00] together um some slideshows to to kind
[33:03] of make that interactive and interesting
[33:05] as we look down across history because
[33:07] we don't want it to just be a history
[33:09] lesson. The history um if you just
[33:13] understand
[33:15] that that prophecy controls history,
[33:19] all history that's ever happened
[33:22] because God spoke his plan, his vision.
[33:28] And therefore, history has to move
[33:30] according to prophecy. It cannot deviate
[33:34] the the even when it's when it's
[33:37] forecasted by prophecy in the future, by
[33:40] the time it gets to the event and moves
[33:42] beyond it, the history will agree with
[33:45] the prophecy.
[33:48] So, so just just bear in mind that we're
[33:52] we're going to go as the Lord directs
[33:54] and we want to show the relevance of the
[33:57] history, the relevance of why there's a
[34:01] message of why you're a Christian. There
[34:04] are reasons for that. None of this is
[34:06] accidental.
[34:08] So, you know, from Sunday, one of the
[34:10] things that we were pointing to, and I
[34:13] want to just have this, this is my only
[34:15] note of recap from Sunday is that we
[34:19] were showing you that victory in the
[34:22] kingdom of Christ. Because you remember
[34:24] we read Revelation 12, they love not
[34:27] their lives unto death. They overcame by
[34:29] the blood of the lamb, right? They love
[34:31] not their lives unto death. They were
[34:33] willing to be living witnesses at
[34:36] whatever cost.
[34:39] That's a big statement. They were
[34:42] willing to be living witnesses of God at
[34:45] whatever cost. They were willing to be
[34:48] living witnesses without even knowing
[34:50] the cost.
[34:52] That's poor business savvy. Nobody's
[34:56] going to go into and make a commitment.
[34:58] They don't even know what they're
[34:59] buying. They don't even know what
[35:01] they're agreeing to. They don't even
[35:02] know what they're going to get out of
[35:03] all of this. You'll hear people say it
[35:05] all the time. Somebody will offer them a
[35:06] deal and say, "What's in it for me?"
[35:09] Here is a people who are who are born
[35:12] into the world and we live our lives and
[35:15] there's this there's this almost
[35:18] inexplicable
[35:20] power that that can only be
[35:22] supernatural. And here we are believing
[35:25] in a man who we've who we've never met
[35:28] in the flesh.
[35:29] Who this book that was put together by
[35:32] men led of the Holy Spirit told us about
[35:34] a man who lived 2,000 years ago that he
[35:38] was the son of God. John declared it.
[35:40] The people believed it. And we are here
[35:42] believing it today. And we're standing.
[35:45] And the church has stood for 2,000 years
[35:48] on testimony of a single man. John said,
[35:52] "I saw the spirit of God descending on
[35:55] him. He's the lamb of God."
[35:59] See, and and you've heard me say it
[36:03] before. Jesus never said it would be
[36:06] easy, but he did say it would be worth
[36:08] it. And I'm here to tell you something,
[36:10] friends. If I already think it's worth
[36:12] it before heaven, what am I going to
[36:14] think when I'm in the heaven?
[36:16] If I'm already in the greatest battle
[36:19] ever fought, if I'm already in Satan's
[36:21] Eden, if it's already darkness over the
[36:23] whole world and I'm having a good time
[36:25] and and gross darkness on the minds of
[36:27] men, but I wake up every day with the
[36:29] joy of the Lord, what will it be when we
[36:32] get over yonder,
[36:36] but we were reminded from Sunday that
[36:38] victory in the kingdom of Christ comes
[36:41] through. Now, here's a guarantee.
[36:44] Victory. How many want it?
[36:50] It comes through anguish. Let's see if I
[36:53] got the same amount of hands.
[36:56] Comes through tribulation.
[37:00] Overcoming. And that ain't always easy.
[37:03] That takes a fight. And it takes
[37:05] sometimes a fighting spirit. It takes
[37:08] the zeal of the Holy Spirit upon you to
[37:10] keep to keep going forward when
[37:13] mentally, emotionally, physically, for
[37:17] every reason under the sun that the
[37:20] devil doesn't want you to keep going.
[37:22] Somehow you just keep going. And I don't
[37:25] even know how I got to hear from a year
[37:27] ago, but here I am. And I plan to go
[37:30] another one. So, what'll happen when you
[37:31] get to that one? Then I'll go another
[37:33] one. And then I'll go another one. And
[37:35] one of these days I'll walk off the
[37:36] earth and I'll walk into a time where it
[37:38] won't be years, months, days, and weeks.
[37:46] We've got to overcome. And and the
[37:48] message to you in this what I consider a
[37:52] large point from Sunday.
[37:55] Overcoming what? Overcoming what? I
[37:57] think it's a fair question.
[38:00] Overcoming anything. And I do mean to
[38:03] say anything.
[38:06] No matter how valuable it may be to you,
[38:10] no matter how much time and resources of
[38:15] investment you have poured into it,
[38:19] anything that you discover is contrary
[38:24] to God's word living itself through your
[38:29] life. You need to get rid of it.
[38:34] You need to change course. There is
[38:37] nothing worth missing the love of God
[38:41] glowing in your heart and the power of
[38:43] the Holy Spirit living through your life
[38:45] daily, laying your head on your pillow
[38:47] at night, content that you're in the
[38:49] will of God, waking up the next morning,
[38:51] and it doesn't matter if it's sunny or
[38:53] raining. It doesn't matter if if you're
[38:55] waking up under the same anguish and
[38:58] stress and tribulation that you went to
[39:00] bed with and it might even be worse. You
[39:02] prayed all night that it would be better
[39:04] and it was worse. But listen, there's a
[39:06] power that can take a hold of your life
[39:08] and you'll keep going and you'll keep
[39:11] going until when? Until you just keep
[39:13] going.
[39:16] And that and that is and that comes down
[39:18] to now here here's my large looming
[39:22] question for tonight.
[39:24] This is another one that I plan to to
[39:28] repeat.
[39:33] Which altar?
[39:35] We have two young men coming. Act one,
[39:39] scene one.
[39:41] Two men
[39:43] coming to two altars.
[39:45] And they had they were very different in
[39:48] what they brought for a sacrifice. Their
[39:51] attitudes were different. God handled
[39:54] them differently. God's response was
[39:56] different. The the the the response of
[40:00] the brothers were different, vastly
[40:03] different.
[40:06] So the question becomes, which altar do
[40:10] you bow at today?
[40:14] Genesis
[40:15] is showing us this is the genesis of
[40:18] humanity, the beginning of the
[40:20] beginnings. This is scene one, act one.
[40:24] Genesis shows us that you worship, not
[40:29] you will, you do worship at one or the
[40:34] other.
[40:37] Brother Brandham would say
[40:42] in 1950, show us the father.
[40:45] There is something in the human heart
[40:49] that calls out for worship somewhere. No
[40:53] man is on earth without worship. He
[40:57] worships something. The caveman, the
[41:02] Indians, the American Indian, he
[41:04] worshiped the sun. He believed. He
[41:06] believed there was a happy hunting
[41:07] ground. And when one died, they put corn
[41:09] and so forth in his bow and arrow and
[41:11] sent him out across the sea somewhere in
[41:13] his canoe that he would find the happy
[41:16] hunting ground where he would have
[41:17] provision to carry him over. And so he
[41:20] says, you know, the age-old cry is, if I
[41:23] could only find God. And he says, all
[41:25] ages, people are born to worship. In
[41:28] fact is the human animal is the only
[41:32] animal that does worship. He's the only
[41:35] one that turns around and worships his
[41:37] maker. The human animal is the only of
[41:40] all the animal kingdoms. He's the only
[41:41] one who prays
[41:44] because he's made at the highest order
[41:46] in the image of God. He's a bearer of
[41:48] God's image. So he says you'll worship.
[41:51] Maybe it's your child, your car, your
[41:53] home, your job, maybe even your church.
[41:59] That will not work.
[42:02] It isn't the church we worship, it's
[42:05] God.
[42:07] He goes on half a decade later
[42:11] and he talks about we come to America,
[42:13] we found the American Indian worshiping
[42:15] something, the sun, the moon, nature,
[42:16] because it's in him as a human being. He
[42:18] knows he has a maker. So there's
[42:20] something within his human heart called
[42:23] out to worship it. It is to every more
[42:26] mortal. You might worship your
[42:28] automobile, your job, your house or
[42:31] something. You'll worship something. So
[42:34] if there's any idol, take it out and let
[42:38] Jesus Christ have first place. Let him
[42:41] be first of all. Can you imagine? A
[42:43] prophet is not commanding you to do
[42:45] something. He's saying let him be. This
[42:49] is what you need to do. Let let the word
[42:52] of God dwell in you richly. as Paul
[42:54] would say, "Let this mind which was in
[42:57] Christ be in you." See, he comes along a
[43:01] year later. This is this is the last one
[43:02] I want to read. He said, "That's the
[43:05] back that that's just a background for
[43:06] something that God made you to do. God
[43:09] made you to be a worshshiper, a
[43:10] worshshiper of him." You'll worship
[43:12] something regardless of what it is.
[43:15] You'll worship your wife. You'll worship
[43:16] your children. You'll worship anything,
[43:18] your automobile,
[43:20] you'll worship your pleasure. You'll So,
[43:23] you know what? We're discovering worship
[43:25] is more than just raising hands, closing
[43:27] eyes, and crying tears, and singing
[43:29] songs.
[43:31] Worship is something that focuses your
[43:33] attention away from something else. When
[43:36] when you're worshiping, you know, and
[43:38] your your hands are up and your your
[43:41] eyes are closed and tears are coming
[43:43] down your face. Now, if it's just a
[43:44] form, you might be sitting there
[43:46] thinking about, is my team going to make
[43:47] the Super Bowl this year? But when it is
[43:49] really in your heart to worship God,
[43:52] you're not worried about who's going to
[43:54] win a game. You're not even you're not
[43:56] even sure that the rapture might happen
[43:59] right at any moment. You can get that
[44:00] far gone in worship.
[44:03] But it's not just that.
[44:05] It's anything that could distract you or
[44:08] turn you aside that you give attention
[44:11] to
[44:13] more.
[44:15] It's something that that attracts your
[44:21] your time more your resources more than
[44:27] what you can give and do for the kingdom
[44:29] of God. It will it it will cause you to
[44:33] set aside time
[44:36] that you owe to God and you will give it
[44:39] to something else. And brother Brandham
[44:41] said that's prostitution
[44:43] of your time that you owe to God.
[44:47] That's pretty stiff.
[44:49] But but it's prostitution of your time
[44:52] that you owe to God. And I mean it it
[44:56] comes out in people's lifestyles. It
[44:58] comes out it'll come out in something as
[45:01] simple and mundane as as their church
[45:03] attendance.
[45:05] And you'll see you'll see that that
[45:07] every other thing just takes such a
[45:10] priority over that. And and and people
[45:14] will chase careers, sometimes political
[45:16] careers, sometimes business careers, and
[45:19] you know, they'll they'll they'll chase,
[45:20] you know, the the finer things of life.
[45:22] and and and at the cost of their
[45:26] spirituality, which is insane
[45:31] because it doesn't matter how much
[45:33] money's in your bank account, you can't
[45:35] fight the devil with your checkbook.
[45:40] You can only fight the devil because
[45:42] he's a spiritual being. That's why Paul
[45:44] says, "We wrestle not against flesh and
[45:47] blood. We wrestle against principalities
[45:50] and powers of the air."
[45:52] So, brother Brandham says, "You'll
[45:53] worship your children, you'll worship
[45:55] anything, your automobile, you'll
[45:57] worship pleasure, you'll worship
[46:00] something because it's in mankind to
[46:03] worship." Uh, now it's a fair question
[46:07] tonight to say, "Brother Jason, what
[46:10] does this have to do with prophecy?" I'm
[46:13] not preaching on prophecy. I'm preaching
[46:16] on modern events are again being made
[46:19] clear in prophecy.
[46:21] Why do we see the world in the darkness
[46:26] that it is? And I could stand here
[46:27] tonight and just go down a list. It
[46:30] could it I could make it as depressing
[46:32] as I wanted to. And we would leave here
[46:34] and go, there's just no hope for
[46:36] humanity. How did it get this way? And
[46:38] why is it like this? I'm here to tell
[46:40] you, it's a modern event. The darkness
[46:43] of the world is a modern event that's
[46:46] made clear to us by prophecy. And what
[46:48] is made clear to us so that we don't go
[46:52] off the deep end of the of depression is
[46:54] is is that yes, there would be darkness
[46:57] over the world. There would be gross
[46:59] darkness on the mind minds of the
[47:00] people. You can't stop that. You can't
[47:02] you can't fix it. But here's what you
[47:05] can rejoice over. You can arise and you
[47:08] can shine because your light has come.
[47:12] That's a modern event.
[47:17] We've said a lot about hearing,
[47:19] recognizing, and acting upon the word.
[47:21] And when, not if, and I just say it that
[47:24] way, when, not if, but when the enemy
[47:28] assails me
[47:31] and the battle of my mind.
[47:35] Anybody else fighting those kind of
[47:37] battles?
[47:41] when the enemy comes in and and I face
[47:44] the battles of of my mind and this I
[47:48] want to I want to say to you tonight as
[47:50] somebody with some experience in this
[47:52] and you can take my word for it. What
[47:55] I'm about to tell you is the truth, the
[47:57] whole truth and nothing but the truth.
[48:00] You're going to face these mind battles.
[48:02] It's the greatest battle ever fought.
[48:04] It's an agreement between God and Satan
[48:06] for control of man. The battle would be
[48:09] in the human mind. You can't pray the
[48:11] devil out of that spot because God
[48:13] already gave him the ability to try to
[48:16] bombard you. You know what? You know how
[48:18] an enemy does it? You know how they you
[48:20] know how they they they defeat an enemy
[48:22] uh uh somebody with superior weapons and
[48:25] and and and you can shoot you can fly a
[48:27] drone in or shoot a missile and then
[48:29] then you know the US or Israel they can
[48:31] shoot a missile to hit your missile or a
[48:33] missile to hit your drone and and in
[48:35] fact is they that it's unsustainable
[48:37] because you know you get you get radical
[48:40] rebels who are firing a a $20,000 drone
[48:45] and the Navy's response is to shoot one
[48:48] not one but $2 million missiles to hit
[48:50] it.
[48:53] And we at this point just just in the
[48:56] just there where the Houthi rebels are
[48:58] attacking a naval fleet. We we've
[49:00] already spent a billion dollars. But
[49:02] it's actually five billion because that
[49:05] billion dollars was when they bought
[49:06] that missile back in the 90s. Try to
[49:08] replace it. Now it's five times that
[49:09] much.
[49:11] So there there there's no way to fix
[49:13] this. man in his technology cannot
[49:16] repair this broken world. Oh, there's
[49:19] going to be a one coming that's going to
[49:21] set up a kingdom. Oh, that can never be
[49:24] moved. I'm so glad for that. But when
[49:26] the enemy, not if, but when and as he
[49:29] comes and assails you in the battles of
[49:31] your mind, this process laid out by
[49:34] Elijah will be the greatest comfort when
[49:38] you are willing to hear and recognize
[49:40] and act upon the word of God. that that
[49:43] that triple uh way of going at it is the
[49:47] greatest comfort that I have. I face
[49:49] these kind of battles, but I know this.
[49:52] I hear his word. I recognize it. Not
[49:55] only do I recognize it's true, I
[49:57] recognize I love it.
[50:00] I recognize it's for me. And if the rest
[50:03] of the world, the entire population
[50:05] doesn't want it, I want it. I'll take my
[50:08] part, your part, their part, everybody's
[50:10] part.
[50:13] But what they do to over to override
[50:16] your missile defense is they just
[50:19] bombard you until you run out of missile
[50:21] defending missiles to shoot them down
[50:23] with. They just they'll send in a
[50:26] hundred drones to take out all your
[50:28] missiles and then then you're then
[50:29] you're defenseless. And that's a that's
[50:31] a great tactic in warfare on the cheap.
[50:34] But don't think the enemy didn't invent
[50:36] that tactic.
[50:38] You get you get a couple of church
[50:40] services a week. So he sends about 25
[50:43] bombardments on you to knock out your
[50:46] two times where you come in here for
[50:47] hour and a half, two hours and we sing
[50:49] some songs and we hear some word of God.
[50:51] This must be some powerful word. If you
[50:54] keep making it back here every time and
[50:56] you're not overran by the enemy, I tell
[50:59] you something, friends, we've got some
[51:01] we've got some word ammunition that is
[51:03] more than a match for him.
[51:06] But he bombards us. It's constant
[51:08] spiritual warfare like never before. And
[51:12] when I can see myself so willingly
[51:14] falling in line. When I can see myself
[51:20] willingly
[51:22] falling in line with this process of
[51:24] hearing, recognizing, and acting on the
[51:26] word. Then that to me that brings me
[51:30] comfort because to me that's an evidence
[51:33] of my new birth.
[51:36] Because I mean why wouldn't it be the
[51:38] the I'm less than 100th of 1% of the
[51:43] population of the earth who are willing
[51:44] to do it. Surprisingly,
[51:46] the odds are so against, you know,
[51:49] everyone really because the overwhelming
[51:51] majority according to prophecy, a modern
[51:53] event of today that's made clear by
[51:57] prophecy is people uh love Satan
[52:04] who claim they love Jesus, but they
[52:06] don't. And I'm not saying they're
[52:08] they're lying to you and me. They're
[52:10] probably in most cases lying to
[52:13] themselves.
[52:16] because the ev the the prophecy was that
[52:19] it would be a lie that they would
[52:20] believe.
[52:22] So when you believe a lie, well uh I I
[52:26] can at least say you you cease being a
[52:28] hypocrite.
[52:30] It's not a good way to cease being a
[52:32] hypocrite, but at least you believe the
[52:33] lie.
[52:36] And when I when I realize that I
[52:39] willingly fall in line with this
[52:41] process,
[52:43] uh because I can see that my desire for
[52:47] the Lord is genuine, not fear-based, and
[52:51] neither is it reward-based. It's not
[52:54] about fear. It's not about reward. Uh
[52:57] it's it's completely voluntary from a
[53:01] deep well of love that just wells up
[53:04] within me. And I love his word.
[53:06] Amen.
[53:07] That what a comfort that is when I when
[53:10] I don't always win the battle of the
[53:13] mind, but I know I always win the battle
[53:15] of the heart.
[53:16] Hallelujah.
[53:17] Yeah. If I lose another battle of the
[53:19] mind tomorrow, and I might, but my heart
[53:22] wins every day.
[53:24] Hallelujah.
[53:27] I feel it well up within me from the
[53:29] very center of my being. And I know I'm
[53:32] not the only one. Am
[53:36] I
[53:37] I'm not the only one who can say we care
[53:40] not what it may cost us.
[53:44] How many I got in here tonight say I
[53:47] care not. We care not what it may cost
[53:50] us. Even everything is a small price to
[53:54] pay for what God has. The world looks at
[53:58] you and and really no wonder they think
[54:01] you're crazy and they think you're a
[54:03] cult. No wonder the devil can't figure
[54:05] you out because that's nuts
[54:10] to say it's worth it all. No cost is too
[54:14] great for me to love God.
[54:20] That's when you know you've passed from
[54:21] death to life.
[54:24] My heart rejoices and I know yours does
[54:27] too when I hear a prophet say and I know
[54:30] it's not a prophet. I know that we're
[54:32] not following a man. I'm here to tell
[54:34] you something. We have the ministry of
[54:36] the morning star. The very thing what
[54:38] that's what's happening. That's a modern
[54:40] event made clear in prophecy. We've got
[54:42] the ministry of the morning star. It's
[54:44] not a man's ministry. And I and I I
[54:46] revel in hearing that voice say, "You
[54:49] are predestinated to not fall."
[54:52] Hallelujah. Oh my. It it's and and and
[54:56] be as I said Sunday, it's so impossible
[54:59] that that that we can be a believer that
[55:01] that even when I lose mind battles and
[55:03] and I get overwhelmed and from the
[55:05] bombarding of the enemy that I still get
[55:08] back up and go forward again. That's so
[55:11] impossible. I know it can't be me doing
[55:13] it. It's got to be him doing it,
[55:17] friends.
[55:19] Hallelujah. Amen. I know it's not me
[55:21] keeping me. I know it's him.
[55:24] I can see by evidence.
[55:28] You can see by evidence
[55:33] that it's obviously not the voice, the
[55:37] same voice the world is hearing
[55:40] because they are so opposite.
[55:45] not only doing
[55:48] opposite of God's family but thinking
[55:51] opposite
[55:53] that the mind of Christ has become
[55:58] the polar opposite.
[56:01] The days of Noah and the days of Sodom
[56:04] having returned to the earth as a as a
[56:07] like a double barrel shotgun. No ages
[56:10] ever had to face them both
[56:11] simultaneously.
[56:14] We have them both simultaneously at the
[56:18] end time as because with the ministry of
[56:20] the son of man, the the we're going to
[56:22] get the double whammy of the days of
[56:24] Noah and the and that was a day when
[56:26] every man's mind across the world was
[56:28] evil continually.
[56:30] And we've got uh the the evil and
[56:32] perversion of Sodom that was so wicked
[56:36] that they wanted to they wanted to uh uh
[56:39] experience their perverted lifestyle on
[56:42] angels.
[56:45] Imagine the insanity.
[56:48] And that's what you and I face today.
[56:50] So, oh, they won't hurt me. They won't
[56:51] hurt my kids. They went after angels.
[56:56] They they were it was anarchy. They had
[56:58] no regard for the law. Even even even
[57:01] Lot as the mayor of the city and a judge
[57:03] couldn't stop them. Even though he
[57:05] reasoned with them and gave them a very
[57:08] good reason that you would think was
[57:10] logical, gave them a very good reason to
[57:13] not do it. Here, do this instead. And
[57:16] against all human sensibility, they
[57:18] said, "No, we want what we want or you
[57:21] give it to us or we're going to kill
[57:22] you."
[57:25] And here we are in this day. We can
[57:27] certainly see by the evidence that
[57:29] they're not hearing the same voice we're
[57:31] hearing. It it the world seems to um
[57:36] invent new ways every day to defy God in
[57:39] his word. And and so so that's why
[57:43] that's another reason that I can know.
[57:45] That's another evidence. I don't need to
[57:48] to speak a storm out of existence. I can
[57:51] see the evidence of the word of God in
[57:55] contrast to the rest of the world.
[57:58] I'm looking at the proof in the Holy
[58:01] Ghost. I'm looking at the proof. I'm the
[58:03] proof. You're the proof. I'm here to
[58:05] tell you something, friends. If you can
[58:07] really grasp and get a hold of what this
[58:09] series is about is that you are becoming
[58:13] a modern event made clear in prophecy.
[58:17] It's not just about what's Russia doing,
[58:19] what's America, what's the Vatican. I am
[58:21] a modern event made clear in prophecy.
[58:27] If if if victory in the kingdom of
[58:29] Christ
[58:32] comes through anguish,
[58:34] then paradoxically we say, "So be it."
[58:39] And the world says, "No, wait. You what?
[58:41] Hold on.
[58:43] If your victory takes anguish, you're
[58:45] good with that." Absolutely.
[58:49] Especially considering the alternative.
[58:53] So, it's it circles me back again. And
[58:56] I'm going to circle I'm going to keep
[58:57] circling back and circling back every
[58:59] time the Holy Spirit
[59:01] presses on me because it's not in my
[59:03] notes where I'm at.
[59:05] What altar
[59:07] are you worshiping at
[59:11] on a daily and weekly basis?
[59:15] because you're worshiping at one or the
[59:17] other and there's not a middle third
[59:19] one.
[59:22] There's only two.
[59:26] If it takes anguish, so be it.
[59:28] Tribulation, so be it. Hey, it's not the
[59:32] great tribulation that the rest of the
[59:34] world I mean, that's enough to rejoice
[59:36] in. Yeah, I might have some tribulation,
[59:39] but I'm not going to have to go to that
[59:41] tribulation. when that tribulation is
[59:43] falling, I'll be at a table thousands of
[59:45] miles long.
[59:47] So, we can rejoice in that if for if for
[59:50] no other reason. He I mean, listen
[59:52] friends, we we read to you from Sunday
[59:54] in in chapter 12 of Revelation. Even
[59:57] Jesus,
[59:59] even Christ himself had to fight with
[1:00:02] his angels just to secure heaven against
[1:00:05] Lucifer and his angels.
[1:00:08] Michael and his angels fought against
[1:00:10] Lucifer and his angels.
[1:00:13] So how then would we imagine if Christ
[1:00:17] himself had to fight to preserve his
[1:00:20] kingdom, then how is that not going to
[1:00:23] be true for his family? It's the same
[1:00:25] Christ and the same devil.
[1:00:28] And and here we are and the great battle
[1:00:30] is taking place in your mind. I'm here
[1:00:34] to tell you something, friends. The
[1:00:35] audacity of Satan knows no bounds. He'll
[1:00:38] go as low as as he needs to go. He'll do
[1:00:41] whatever he needs to do. He'll promise
[1:00:42] you the moon and stab you in the back a
[1:00:45] thousand times. Oh, reject him, young
[1:00:47] people. Reject him. He has nothing to
[1:00:50] offer you. Has no heaven, no eternal
[1:00:52] life, no joy, no peace, no none of that.
[1:00:55] No new body, no new world.
[1:00:57] Everything he's offering you ends in
[1:01:00] destruction.
[1:01:04] So this is the model for his family.
[1:01:08] His family like him are warriors of
[1:01:12] faith. We're not poets and philosophers.
[1:01:16] We're not just I mean, you know, there's
[1:01:18] a I get it. Solomon said, "Hey, there's
[1:01:20] a time uh to everything. There's a
[1:01:23] season and a time to every purpose under
[1:01:27] heaven. I'm not against poetry. I'm not
[1:01:29] against philosophy. I'm not against, you
[1:01:31] know, music and and all of these things,
[1:01:33] but I but I but what I'm but what I'm
[1:01:36] and I get it. I get it. Jesus Yeah,
[1:01:38] you're right. Jesus is a gentle savior.
[1:01:41] That's what he's known as. He's known as
[1:01:44] the gentle savior. He is indeed a
[1:01:47] blessed redeemer. Amen. Have you known
[1:01:50] him like that? Have you known him as a
[1:01:52] gentle savior? Have you known him as a
[1:01:54] blessed redeemer?
[1:01:56] But I'm here to tell you when he needs
[1:01:58] to be that meek and lowly prophet of
[1:02:01] Nazareth is not a philosopher. He's not
[1:02:03] a poet. The Bible says he's a warrior
[1:02:06] king. He's the king of glory.
[1:02:11] Oh my. When that when he that ascended
[1:02:13] first descended into the lower parts of
[1:02:15] the earth, when he took the keys of
[1:02:18] death and hell and took that from Satan,
[1:02:20] when he took his own family and brought
[1:02:23] them up out of the grave and took them
[1:02:25] to the father's throne, he wasn't a
[1:02:27] philosopher. He was a warrior.
[1:02:30] Lift up your heads, said the psalmist in
[1:02:32] ver in chapter 24. Lift up your heads,
[1:02:35] oh you gates, and be you lift up you
[1:02:38] everlasting doors, and the King of glory
[1:02:40] shall come in. Who is the King of glory?
[1:02:44] The Lord strong and mighty. The Lord
[1:02:48] mighty in battle.
[1:02:52] I um we didn't have it tonight, but I've
[1:02:56] uh Sister Emily is actually going to
[1:02:58] sing a song for me uh in in another
[1:03:00] service. I love the song. I play it
[1:03:02] constantly. Amen. I just love it. I sing
[1:03:05] it to myself. I whistle it. I hum it.
[1:03:07] And and you know, it's the armor of God
[1:03:10] song. It's the head to toe, covered head
[1:03:12] to toe. And I I I not only love the way
[1:03:16] Sister M sings it, but I love these
[1:03:18] lyrics. Listen to this now. Listen to
[1:03:20] this. She's going to sing it for me
[1:03:21] soon. Do not fear. Be strong in the
[1:03:27] power of the Lord.
[1:03:29] And let the keeper of the stars. Could I
[1:03:32] advise you tonight? Let the keeper of
[1:03:34] the stars keep your heart forever more.
[1:03:37] Does he keep the stars? You think he
[1:03:39] could keep your heart? You think you
[1:03:41] could trust him?
[1:03:44] I love this. Even though you might be
[1:03:46] small, this blows this blows my mind
[1:03:49] when I think of these two lines. Even
[1:03:52] though you might be small, it is in you
[1:03:55] his kingdom reigns.
[1:03:59] And from your mouth, the Lord has made a
[1:04:03] fountain for his praise.
[1:04:05] Oh, hallelujah. And with his
[1:04:07] righteousness across your chest,
[1:04:10] salvation for your head, the belt of
[1:04:13] truth around you now, with the shield of
[1:04:15] faith in hand, and with his peace upon
[1:04:19] your feet, everywhere you go, his word
[1:04:23] will be the sword you keep. You're
[1:04:27] covered head to toe.
[1:04:30] Oh, you're covered head to toe. I'm
[1:04:33] covered head to toe. Oh, the night is
[1:04:36] quickly fading
[1:04:39] and the day will soon break in. Are you
[1:04:42] happy for that? Are you excited?
[1:04:45] The long night is almost over.
[1:04:48] Oh, rejoice, friends. The long night is
[1:04:50] almost over. We're about to see a modern
[1:04:52] event that's made clear in prophecy. The
[1:04:56] night is almost over. Uh the night is
[1:04:58] quickly fading and the day will soon
[1:05:01] break in. And with the dawn, the Lord
[1:05:04] will give the grace you need to stand
[1:05:07] and turn your worries into songs.
[1:05:11] Put on your covering of light.
[1:05:15] Almost can't take this one. You will
[1:05:18] long outlast this darkness because he's
[1:05:23] with you in the fight. Oh, every time it
[1:05:27] comes without say, Lord, I'll outlast
[1:05:29] this darkness. There ain't no devil.
[1:05:31] There ain't enough devils in all of
[1:05:33] hell. There ain't enough darkness. I'll
[1:05:35] long outlast this darkness. I can
[1:05:38] outlast the devil. Can you outlast him?
[1:05:40] I'm I'm connected to an eternal being.
[1:05:43] Oh, under the order of Melzdc, in whom
[1:05:46] there no father, no mother, no beginning
[1:05:48] of days, no ending of life. He abideth
[1:05:51] continually a priest forever.
[1:05:54] Oh, I love the fact that his gentle he,
[1:05:57] you know, and and hey, listen,
[1:06:00] just like he sometimes he is a a gentle
[1:06:04] savior.
[1:06:06] Well, you know, after after the the
[1:06:10] order and and Old Testament type there
[1:06:12] in Genesis 41, after the gentile bride
[1:06:15] of Azeneth that Joseph took and we're a
[1:06:19] bride in that order, a gentile bride
[1:06:22] that Joseph being the type of Christ and
[1:06:24] he took he took a aszeneath and as a
[1:06:27] type Joseph's of Joseph's gentile bride
[1:06:30] there in Genesis 41 like Christ
[1:06:34] we are humble. We say with Jesus,
[1:06:37] "Father, forgive them
[1:06:40] for they know not what they do." Do you
[1:06:42] know that brother Brandon when he goes
[1:06:44] to Revelation chapter 6
[1:06:48] and he comes under the fifth seal there
[1:06:50] in Revelation chapter 6 and we find
[1:06:52] under the fifth seal and when he had
[1:06:54] opened the fifth seal, I saw under the
[1:06:57] altar the souls of them. This is
[1:07:00] Revelation 6. I saw under the altar the
[1:07:03] souls of them that were slain for the
[1:07:05] word of God and for the testimony which
[1:07:08] they held. And brother Bradam says, now
[1:07:10] notice, it was not the testimony of
[1:07:14] Jesus.
[1:07:15] It was the testimony they held.
[1:07:18] So these are Jews. Now he gets another
[1:07:21] clue.
[1:07:23] And they cried with a loud voice,
[1:07:25] saying, "How long, O Lord, holy and
[1:07:28] true, dust thou not judge and avenge our
[1:07:32] blood on them that dwell on the earth?"
[1:07:34] See, and brother Brandham says, see
[1:07:36] right there, that shows you that it was
[1:07:38] not the Gentile bride? Because the
[1:07:40] Gentile bride is like Jesus, father,
[1:07:42] forgive them. And these are calling out
[1:07:45] for blood and revenge. So the fact that
[1:07:47] they didn't have the testimony of
[1:07:49] Christ, they're crying out for revenge.
[1:07:51] They're Jews. And so and white robes
[1:07:53] were given unto every one of them. And
[1:07:56] it was said unto them that they should
[1:07:58] rest yet for a little season until their
[1:08:01] fellow servants also and their brethren,
[1:08:03] this is going to be the 144,000 that
[1:08:06] should be killed as they were. And and
[1:08:08] this had to be fulfilled. So they it it
[1:08:11] had to fill up the measure under the
[1:08:13] trumpets because the seals are to the
[1:08:15] Gentiles and the trumpets are to the
[1:08:16] Jews. And so that's what the trumpets
[1:08:19] do. Just like when we open the seals, we
[1:08:22] could see the Holy Spirit tracking the
[1:08:24] Gentile church through history through
[1:08:26] four horse riders. The the trumpets do
[1:08:28] the same thing. It tracks the Jews
[1:08:30] through their history. And so and that's
[1:08:32] why the trumpet and the vial are so
[1:08:34] closely connected because the vial
[1:08:36] affects politics and the and what's
[1:08:38] going on in the world. So God, brother
[1:08:40] Brandham said all of these things are
[1:08:42] happening in a cluster. God's running it
[1:08:43] all at the same time. And so so we find
[1:08:47] out that that the prophet could look at
[1:08:49] Genesis at at Revelation 6 and say
[1:08:52] that's not the bride. This is the Jews.
[1:08:55] And they're waiting uh they they because
[1:08:57] when the when the when those in the
[1:09:00] sixth dimension in Paul's day and
[1:09:01] Irenanius's day and and Martin's day,
[1:09:04] Columba and Luther and Wesley when the
[1:09:05] Isuza fathers when brother Brandham and
[1:09:07] his group when they leave that sixth
[1:09:10] dimension to come up what we would say
[1:09:13] come up out of the grave. Listen
[1:09:14] friends, they're just they're not laying
[1:09:16] in the ground. That's just their corpse.
[1:09:18] They're in another dimension. They'll
[1:09:20] pick up that corpse and step in and
[1:09:22] you'll see them and you'll be changed in
[1:09:24] a moment.
[1:09:26] You're talking about a modern event made
[1:09:28] clear in prophecy. The prophecy of the
[1:09:30] coming of the Lord is very clear in
[1:09:31] Paul's teaching. And so we we find out
[1:09:34] that that these Jews will uh under the
[1:09:38] fifth seal, they're given white robes.
[1:09:40] And when they when they're under the
[1:09:42] altar and they see all of those six
[1:09:46] sixth dimension Gentiles from 2,000
[1:09:49] years of church history when they see
[1:09:51] them leaving because they're all under
[1:09:54] the altar in various places. You
[1:09:56] remember when brother Brandham went
[1:09:57] there he didn't see Luther or his
[1:09:58] people. See he didn't see Paul. He
[1:10:00] didn't he couldn't even see Jesus. He
[1:10:02] was up even higher. So he saw his he
[1:10:05] thought they were family. He said
[1:10:06] there's not that many Brandham. Said
[1:10:07] they're not your they're they're not
[1:10:09] brandams. are your converts. They said
[1:10:11] there's millions of them. And so, so now
[1:10:14] we find that when they leave that
[1:10:17] dimension and they come back down to the
[1:10:20] earth and the Jews under the under the
[1:10:23] altar say, "Hey, why are they what about
[1:10:25] us? Why are they getting to leave?" And
[1:10:27] they're just told, "Hold on. You got to
[1:10:29] wait because this is the Gentiles there.
[1:10:32] You've got to wait for your brethren and
[1:10:34] fellow servants to be killed. Here's a
[1:10:36] white robe. You're going to be safe. If
[1:10:38] you didn't even you would have saw
[1:10:40] Christ, but he blinded you so that they
[1:10:42] could get into the kingdom of God. So
[1:10:44] the Gentiles would be his his gentile
[1:10:47] bride, just like Joseph took Asznath.
[1:10:49] And so so they're given white robes and
[1:10:53] told they must rest a little while
[1:10:55] longer. And so we find then that that
[1:10:58] that they were Jews who suffered under
[1:11:00] the trumpets that govern the history of
[1:11:03] the blinded of blinded Israel. But his
[1:11:06] gentile bride uh follows it, you know,
[1:11:10] it and and and and we're like Christ.
[1:11:13] We're that gentle savior, that gentle
[1:11:16] father, forgive them. We're we have an
[1:11:19] abundant grace for all. Even we're even
[1:11:22] told to pray for our enemies.
[1:11:25] I hope we do.
[1:11:28] We're told to even if we get angry,
[1:11:30] don't don't cross over and sin or let
[1:11:32] the sun go down on your wrath. See,
[1:11:36] Ephesians 4 tells us, "Be angry and sin
[1:11:38] not. Let not the sun go down on your
[1:11:40] wrath, neither give place to the devil."
[1:11:42] This is Gentiles. Second Timothy 2, "And
[1:11:45] the servant of the Lord must not
[1:11:48] strive." Listen up, preachers. He must
[1:11:50] not strive, but be gentle unto all men,
[1:11:53] apt to teach, patient in meekness,
[1:11:56] instructing those that oppose
[1:11:57] themselves. I if if God per adventure
[1:12:01] will give them repentance to the
[1:12:02] acknowledging of the truth. You don't
[1:12:04] know how many times I have had to
[1:12:06] remember that because it can feel like
[1:12:08] people are opposing me and I have to
[1:12:10] constantly remind myself they're
[1:12:12] opposing themselves. They're not
[1:12:14] opposing me because that would suggest I
[1:12:16] can help them and and that wouldn't be
[1:12:19] true at all. Only he can help them. And
[1:12:22] so when I realize that they're they're
[1:12:23] in their own way. I'm not I'm not their
[1:12:26] problem. God's not their problem.
[1:12:28] they're their problem. And if I can just
[1:12:30] get them to see that and get out of the
[1:12:32] way, then God can come in.
[1:12:35] See, and that they may recover
[1:12:38] themselves out of the snare of the devil
[1:12:40] who are taken captive by him at his
[1:12:42] will. Jesus said in the Gospel of Luke,
[1:12:44] chapter 21, "And ye shall be hated of
[1:12:46] all men for my name's sake, but there
[1:12:49] shall not a hair of your head perish. In
[1:12:52] your patience possess ye your souls."
[1:12:55] it. Jesus obviously wasn't saying
[1:12:58] nobody's ever going to die or be or go
[1:12:59] through anguish or punishment. He's
[1:13:01] saying it's not going to matter. Not a
[1:13:04] hair of your head will perish. Whatever
[1:13:07] the devil ever takes from you as a child
[1:13:09] of God, don't you worry. The Lord will
[1:13:12] give it back to you.
[1:13:15] See, so so like Christ, this this gentle
[1:13:20] savior who when he needs to be can be a
[1:13:23] warrior king. And this bride like her
[1:13:27] savior, prays for her enemies, is
[1:13:29] gentle, kind, and patient, doesn't
[1:13:31] strive. She she she she has boundless
[1:13:35] mercy even for her enemies. But I'm here
[1:13:37] to tell you something, friends. In
[1:13:39] Revelation 19, she comes riding out of
[1:13:43] heaven as an army,
[1:13:46] as an army marching to war with the
[1:13:48] warrior king. So, you know, so when we
[1:13:51] realize that what God needs today is not
[1:13:54] just pacifists and poets and minstros
[1:13:58] and philosophers. He needs soldiers. He
[1:14:02] needs warriors. He needs people of faith
[1:14:05] who are not afraid to draw their sword
[1:14:08] and go to battle not against flesh and
[1:14:10] blood but against principalities and
[1:14:12] powers of the air. He needs fathers who
[1:14:16] who will wave the sword in their home.
[1:14:18] He needs preachers who will wave the
[1:14:19] sword in the pulpit. He needs mothers
[1:14:22] who wave the sword over their over their
[1:14:24] flock.
[1:14:25] He needs teenagers. He needs teenagers
[1:14:28] who are not afraid to take the word of
[1:14:30] God and say, "I'll take the way with the
[1:14:32] Lord's despised few." Hallelujah. I
[1:14:35] started out with Jesus and I'm going
[1:14:37] through. Whether you do or not, I'm
[1:14:39] going. Warriors who only care that the
[1:14:42] word of God is ministered to a dying and
[1:14:45] sin-cursed world. An army who are
[1:14:48] determined. And I am determined. And I
[1:14:51] hope that you are determined.
[1:14:54] We are an army determined to have our
[1:14:57] token on display.
[1:15:01] I am determined. Rejoice in my in my
[1:15:04] suffering. That's why we read, "And they
[1:15:06] overcame him by the blood of the lamb,
[1:15:09] by the word of their testimony. They
[1:15:11] love not their lives unto death.
[1:15:13] Therefore, rejoice you heavens, ye that
[1:15:16] dwell in them." Friends, uh uh we
[1:15:19] they're rejoicing in their suffering.
[1:15:21] Say, "Rejoice.
[1:15:24] Rejoice in my hardships.
[1:15:26] Let me spin it. Rejoice in your triumph.
[1:15:30] Forget the hardship. The hardships are
[1:15:33] going to come. And as soon as you get
[1:15:35] out of one, as brother David Gadman used
[1:15:37] to say, you either just come out of a
[1:15:39] trial or you are right now in a trial or
[1:15:42] you're about to head into a trial.
[1:15:46] Oh, I'm glad to know that beyond a
[1:15:48] valley is a mountain. You can't live up
[1:15:51] there. You're going to have to have
[1:15:52] another valley after that. But then
[1:15:53] another mountain will come one of these
[1:15:55] days, friends. Oh, we're going to step
[1:15:57] on a land and it won't matter mountain
[1:15:59] or valley. It won't matter. It'll all be
[1:16:01] sunshine. It'll all be good. It'll all
[1:16:04] be grace. It'll all be the love of God.
[1:16:07] Nature will be in continuity with God's
[1:16:09] word. All humanity will be in God's in
[1:16:13] God in the continuity of God's word. So,
[1:16:16] we rejoice in our triumph. Hard fault.
[1:16:18] Yep. Yep. They're hard fought. They're
[1:16:20] hard fought, aren't they, friends?
[1:16:22] They're hard fought. Some of them harder
[1:16:24] than others. Some of you, along with
[1:16:26] myself, I've been through some rough,
[1:16:28] hard fights. If you're if you're young,
[1:16:31] I'm not saying that young people don't
[1:16:33] have hard battles. They they face the
[1:16:36] hardest battles of any generation of
[1:16:37] young people ever in history.
[1:16:40] But then but at the same time when you
[1:16:43] you know my wife and I were talking
[1:16:45] about it you know at the age we are now
[1:16:47] by an accumulation
[1:16:50] over the years after a while after many
[1:16:53] years the the accumulation of the
[1:16:56] battles of life begin to pile up and and
[1:16:59] and and and you start you start
[1:17:01] realizing you know I'm closer to there
[1:17:03] than I am to here. I once was young now
[1:17:05] I'm old and and and and I can see my end
[1:17:08] in sight. I'm looking every day for the
[1:17:10] coming of the Lord. Are you looking
[1:17:13] every day for it? I'm pressing harder
[1:17:15] than I ever pressed before in my life.
[1:17:18] I'm as at at my age and I can't even
[1:17:21] appreciate the accumulation of battles
[1:17:23] that Sister Jean or those who are in
[1:17:24] here who are older than me. But I'm here
[1:17:26] to tell you it'll be worth it all.
[1:17:29] Oh my. By the time we walk out in that
[1:17:34] millennial world, I ain't going to study
[1:17:37] war no more. So, full circle,
[1:17:41] here it is again. As I come to a close
[1:17:43] for tonight, I'm coming back one more
[1:17:45] time. Full circle.
[1:17:50] Which altar do you bow at today?
[1:17:54] Because you worship at one or the other.
[1:17:59] I thought to myself,
[1:18:02] I had this question
[1:18:04] because of the freak the the the the how
[1:18:08] frequently as I've been studying this,
[1:18:10] the Lord keeps drawing say, "Why you
[1:18:13] keep going for full circle back to
[1:18:15] that?" Good question. I asked the Lord,
[1:18:17] "Why you keep going full circle back to
[1:18:18] that? I've got it in my notes. I've got
[1:18:21] it duplicated in my notes. You want me
[1:18:23] to triple it in my notes?"
[1:18:25] And the Lord just said, "Just put it in
[1:18:27] there till I tell you to stop.
[1:18:30] And I thought, and it's a fair question,
[1:18:32] and the Lord didn't seem to mind the
[1:18:33] question. Why would you want me to
[1:18:35] repeatedly
[1:18:36] ask about the altar that people are
[1:18:40] bowing down at today?
[1:18:43] And very simply put, it's to open the
[1:18:47] eyes of your understanding
[1:18:50] that whatever altar you bow at today is
[1:18:56] the same altar you would have bowed at
[1:18:59] in Genesis 4.
[1:19:01] Don't fool yourself.
[1:19:06] And that that was weighty in my mind.
[1:19:09] And I could hear brother Brandham saying
[1:19:11] people say, "Oh, if I'd have been back
[1:19:12] there in the days of Jesus," he said,
[1:19:14] "you'd do to Jesus just what you do to
[1:19:16] him today. You wouldn't do one thing any
[1:19:19] different at all. What you would be
[1:19:21] today and how you would be toward how
[1:19:23] you are toward his word is exactly how
[1:19:25] you'd be. It wouldn't have mattered if
[1:19:27] you'd have been there walk following
[1:19:29] him, walking the shores of Galilee,
[1:19:32] watching him feed the thousands,
[1:19:33] watching him raise the dead." You know
[1:19:35] how listen friends say, 'Oh, if I could
[1:19:37] just do that, thousands watched that
[1:19:40] and when it all came down to it, he had
[1:19:42] 12 people following him and one of them
[1:19:44] was a devil.
[1:19:48] So don't be naive and don't fool
[1:19:50] yourself. Whatever altar you are bowing
[1:19:53] at today in the condition you are now,
[1:19:56] if you were there in Genesis 4 in that
[1:19:58] same condition, that's exactly the same
[1:20:00] altar you would bow at then. Don't fall
[1:20:03] for the great deception that God's word
[1:20:06] can be compromised on. God's word cannot
[1:20:09] be compromised. There is no middle
[1:20:12] altar. There is no middle ground. And
[1:20:15] and and and you know in in the Christian
[1:20:17] faith, a lot is made. Listen, let me let
[1:20:21] me just say this as I go off the air for
[1:20:22] tonight.
[1:20:24] I want to make this last point
[1:20:28] and I'll close this because I just want
[1:20:30] to make it from my heart and I may make
[1:20:31] it again when I come back to it.
[1:20:36] A lot is made in the Christian faith
[1:20:39] about the resurrection.
[1:20:42] If you're a Christian, you believe in a
[1:20:44] resurrection. For 2,000 years, the
[1:20:47] church has believed
[1:20:49] in the resurrection.
[1:20:53] But I want to draw your attention to
[1:20:56] this fact.
[1:20:59] You mustn't you mustn't think of the
[1:21:02] resurrection
[1:21:04] as merely an event on a calendar.
[1:21:08] There will be a resurrection.
[1:21:11] It will be an event and it's on God's
[1:21:13] calendar. So don't don't mistake me in
[1:21:17] what I'm saying. There will be a
[1:21:19] resurrection. We do believe in the
[1:21:22] corporal return of the Lord Jesus.
[1:21:24] Brother, you know why we believe that?
[1:21:25] Because brother Ram said that's what
[1:21:26] believers believe.
[1:21:28] I just want to make that disclaimer
[1:21:30] before I make this next statement.
[1:21:33] I'm saying to you that you must not just
[1:21:36] merely
[1:21:37] look at the resurrection as an event on
[1:21:41] a calendar. Because Jesus said,
[1:21:46] "I am the resurrection.
[1:21:49] I'm not an event on a calendar. I And he
[1:21:52] said, I am the resurrection and the
[1:21:55] life. So what is the what's going to
[1:21:58] bring about the event of the
[1:22:00] resurrection is a people who went down
[1:22:02] into the grave and they had the
[1:22:05] resurrection and life living inside
[1:22:07] them. You're going to the resurrection
[1:22:10] because the same life that was in Christ
[1:22:13] is in you. the fact, listen friends,
[1:22:16] it's the the very fact that it the token
[1:22:19] is on display and I and that's a quote I
[1:22:21] could open back up and read for you
[1:22:22] tonight, but I've read it for you before
[1:22:25] where Brother Brandham says that the
[1:22:27] that that the uh I should just read it
[1:22:30] because I'm I don't want to butcher it.
[1:22:31] Let me let me just read it for you.
[1:22:33] Brother Brandham says it like this. The
[1:22:36] dynamics of this church will be a
[1:22:39] refilling of the Holy Spirit that we
[1:22:42] have worked in a small measure. Catch
[1:22:44] this now. While the headstone is coming
[1:22:47] down to unite with the body, but when
[1:22:50] that head and body unites together, what
[1:22:54] will happen, brother Jason? The full
[1:22:57] power of the Holy Ghost would raise her
[1:23:00] up just exactly like that. Even the dead
[1:23:03] that's dead in Christ for hundreds of
[1:23:05] years ago will raise in the beauty of
[1:23:08] his holiness and take a flight to the
[1:23:10] skies. The dynamics is the Holy Ghost. A
[1:23:13] refilling of the Holy Ghost. That's what
[1:23:16] I need. That's what you need. That's
[1:23:18] what Bethl Tabernacle needs. That's what
[1:23:20] our families need. I want to be part of
[1:23:23] the resurrection. I am the resurrection
[1:23:26] with Christ. I'm going to experience the
[1:23:29] resurrection because Jesus said, "I am
[1:23:31] the resurrection and the life." He's the
[1:23:34] life that gives you the resurrection.
[1:23:37] The world is looking for it on a
[1:23:38] calendar, but I'm looking at modern
[1:23:40] events made clear. Come on, modern
[1:23:42] events. Stand to your feet right now.
[1:23:44] You're made clear as a modern event.
[1:23:47] You're made clear in prophecy. Say,
[1:23:48] "What kind of event am I?" You're the
[1:23:51] bloodwashed body word, a part of the
[1:23:54] body word of the son of man.
[1:23:57] living in us, moving through our lives.
[1:24:00] That's what it means when we say the
[1:24:03] token on display. That's not a cliche.
[1:24:06] That's not happy thoughts. The token on
[1:24:09] display is a process
[1:24:12] of of you emptying out and Christ
[1:24:16] filling up. And when that head and body
[1:24:19] get to a point where they are so united,
[1:24:22] then you'll see what we've seen in
[1:24:24] measure. The full power of the Holy
[1:24:26] Ghost will raise her up and the dead
[1:24:29] that's been dead in Christ for hundreds
[1:24:31] of years will come out of the grave.
[1:24:34] Oh friends, I want you to go away
[1:24:36] tonight. I want I I'm glad I I was able
[1:24:38] to make that my last point because when
[1:24:40] you leave here tonight, I want you to
[1:24:42] leave here and and I want you to be
[1:24:44] asking yourself these these vital
[1:24:46] questions.
[1:24:47] Am I am I willing to go through anguish,
[1:24:51] trial, suffering in order to be an
[1:24:53] overcomer?
[1:24:55] How many
[1:24:57] am I willing to say even at the cost of
[1:25:00] everything I want to be in that number?
[1:25:05] That's a question you want to leave
[1:25:06] with. The next question you want to
[1:25:08] leave with tomorrow when you wake up,
[1:25:10] ask it, what altar am I worshiping at?
[1:25:13] Let me go through my life. Let me go
[1:25:14] through my home. Let me go through my
[1:25:16] recreation. Let me go through my
[1:25:17] business, my education, my all my my my
[1:25:21] social life and and my friends. Which
[1:25:24] altar?
[1:25:26] Because there's not a compromising one.
[1:25:28] If you're not worshiping at the original
[1:25:30] one, then you're compromised off the
[1:25:32] word of God. Period. Full stop.
[1:25:35] Don't fool yourself. That's the same
[1:25:38] altar you'd worship then.
[1:25:43] And when you start your day out
[1:25:45] tomorrow,
[1:25:47] I want you to look at the resurrection
[1:25:48] differently. Say, "Lord, someday I'm I
[1:25:52] know you're going to split the eastern
[1:25:55] sky one of these mornings perhaps early
[1:25:58] morning prophet thought somewhere
[1:25:59] between 6:00 and 9:00 a.m. Oh my." Uh he
[1:26:02] said you're going to be standing there
[1:26:04] maybe going about your morning standing
[1:26:05] in the kitchen feel a funny little
[1:26:07] feeling go over you turn around and
[1:26:10] there will be that loved one who crossed
[1:26:11] over years ago and when that happens you
[1:26:14] talking about a catalyst for your faith
[1:26:16] buddy you talking and say I don't know
[1:26:18] if I'll have enough faith to change me
[1:26:20] trust me you turn around feel a little
[1:26:22] funny feeling turn around and see that
[1:26:24] that loved one you'll get all the
[1:26:26] catalyst you need you'll get the spark
[1:26:29] you've been longing for friends you know
[1:26:31] why you're going to see that because to
[1:26:33] you, your whole Christian experience is
[1:26:38] part of the resurrection.
[1:26:41] I'm I'm already in my soul resurrected.
[1:26:45] My soul is already in heavenly places in
[1:26:49] Christ Jesus. It's already passed from
[1:26:52] death to life can never come into the
[1:26:54] judgment. Oh, I want to be a modern
[1:26:57] event. How many want to be a modern
[1:26:59] event made clear in prophecy? Let's bow
[1:27:01] our heads. Master,
[1:27:04] thank you for your word tonight.
[1:27:07] Lord, I thank you that I was able to
[1:27:09] what I feel was to deliver my full heart
[1:27:12] tonight, Lord. Not even realizing,
[1:27:15] Father. I didn't realize how far I would
[1:27:17] get. I didn't know how far I would get,
[1:27:19] but as I as I'm clo close my iPad, I
[1:27:22] realize this is exactly where I wanted
[1:27:24] to get to tonight. You do all things
[1:27:26] well, Lord. And I pray, Father, that the
[1:27:30] people who have heard the word of God,
[1:27:31] let it become real, more real than it's
[1:27:35] ever been. Lord, we need that. The day
[1:27:38] and hour that we live in, Lord, we've
[1:27:41] got to see the fullness of the
[1:27:43] resurrection. We've got to see that
[1:27:45] life, that token life living through our
[1:27:47] life. I pray you'll give us that grace
[1:27:50] that we need. Lord, sometimes, it's
[1:27:52] true. It's true. We don't always like to
[1:27:56] admit it even to ourselves.
[1:27:59] [Music]
[1:28:00] In fact, there's a lot of times that
[1:28:02] we're the last one we'll admit it to
[1:28:05] that we have fallen behind
[1:28:08] and we've got some ground we need to
[1:28:09] make up. Lord, I pray for every person
[1:28:13] who's ever felt or might feel like that
[1:28:14] tonight. I raise up my hands and I say,
[1:28:16] Lord God, what we need is a refilling of
[1:28:20] the Holy Ghost. I pray I pray for me. I
[1:28:23] pray for every person in here. I pray
[1:28:25] for this whole assembly near and far,
[1:28:28] Lord, that there would become there
[1:28:30] would come a fresh stir and a fresh
[1:28:32] shaking, a fresh outpouring of the Holy
[1:28:35] Spirit, Lord, to bring us more and more
[1:28:38] in line with the resurrection and the
[1:28:40] life. We commit it to you, Lord. We
[1:28:43] You're the only one that can do it. We
[1:28:44] can't do it. All we can do is pray that
[1:28:46] you'll do it. So, I'm asking that of you
[1:28:49] tonight. Now, take your word, Lord, as
[1:28:53] it's went out. Now, Father, it's seed.
[1:28:55] It's the gospel. It's It's good seed.
[1:28:58] You called it that. The gospel is a
[1:29:00] seed. It's good seed. It'll grow. If it
[1:29:02] can just be planted deep into the hearts
[1:29:04] of your people. You'll water it. It'll
[1:29:06] grow. It'll become a garden of your
[1:29:09] life, Lord. It'll become something
[1:29:11] healthy, something fruitful, something
[1:29:13] fruit bearing, something for the
[1:29:15] master's usage.
[1:29:17] That's what I want, Lord. I I commit it
[1:29:20] to you in Jesus name. for all the people
[1:29:23] in Jesus name. Amen. Come and gather
[1:29:27] with me, friends. We got a couple of uh
[1:29:29] requests here. Amen. Sing something for
[1:29:31] us, Brother Kenny, while we're looking
[1:29:32] all this up. Lord, you have my heart
[1:29:39] and I will search for yours.
[1:29:44] Jesus, take my life and lead me on.
[1:29:51] Oh

[1:29:58] and I will search for yours.

[1:31:48] scene, Lord God, for our brother Luther.

[1:31:54] bring upon him, may the duration of them
[1:31:57] cease, Lord God. May our brother begin
[1:31:59] an immediate turnaround and rapid
[1:32:01] recovery. May you grant it, Lord God.
[1:32:03] Sickness has traveled through a number
[1:32:05] of our families, Lord, that time of
[1:32:07] year, but Lord, you're still God on the
[1:32:09] throne. And we're asking, Father, that
[1:32:11] you put these put these enemies, these
[1:32:13] sickness uh enemies, Lord, uh to flight.
[1:32:17] I pray for our the complete deliverance
[1:32:19] of all your family. Master, now Lord,
[1:32:22] this woman as brother Luther, Lord,
[1:32:24] there's no accidents. There's only God's
[1:32:26] sense. You caused brother Luther to work
[1:32:29] work for this woman. And here's a case
[1:32:31] that she's facing. Critical and serious,
[1:32:33] Lord. Uh almost with almost no remedy to
[1:32:37] it, Lord, and and in bewilderment. But
[1:32:39] Father, you're you're the great
[1:32:41] emancipator. You're the you're the God
[1:32:43] of the impossible. Move on the scene in
[1:32:46] a in a way, Lord God, that it'll have to
[1:32:49] be known and seen that it was you and
[1:32:51] your great great heaping mercy. Grant
[1:32:54] it, Lord. flow into the situation in
[1:32:57] great mercy and kindness. We commit this

[1:33:13] hands of Jehovah. Lord God, we have our
[1:33:16] faith in you for all things that we need

[1:33:20] know how much longer this world can hang
[1:33:23] here, Lord, in this in this time of
[1:33:26] fallen man. We know it's going to pass
[1:33:28] away. The age of fallen man is coming to

[1:33:49] away our tears. Say, "Don't cry no more.
[1:33:51] It's all over. Enter into the joys of
[1:33:53] the Lord." Father, we're asking now for
[1:33:56] the special peace and grace of the Lord.
[1:33:59] Make us, Lord, make us modern events
[1:34:01] made clear that we can be in our own
[1:34:04] life and in our own heart, in our own
[1:34:07] and the way the things that we do and

[1:34:17] we have that life that is the
[1:34:19] resurrection living inside of us. Let
[1:34:22] the resurrection be more than just a
[1:34:25] coming event on a calendar. The whole
