Christ we pray amen amen god bless you friends good to be in the house of the Lord with you this evening [Music] we weren't planning on being here but but evidently the Lord was so we're glad to be little Church body there we've just been going through the storm right along with y'all we had several that were come down with the kovat but the lord raised him up amen so he's healed him each one would greet you Amen from brother Manuel Salazar also I spoke with him this afternoon and and he said make sure you greet them folks down there and Buford for us a man so brother Manuel sends his love and greetings also good to be in the house the Lord sister Joann sends her love amen trust it maybe she's watching this evening and we just greet all the saints that are streaming in this evening on the live hookup and those of you who were able to to come out this evening greet you in the name of the Lord if you have your Bibles invite you straight away into the book of first we'll go we're going to look at one place in first Kings chapter 18 and then we'll go over into second Kings as well have several places in Scripture we want to refer to this evening and get all my buttons pushed here praise the Lord we're in first Kings chapter 18 I want to begin reading at verse 20 first Kings chapter 18 and verse 20 so Ahab sent unto all the children of Israel and gathered the prophets together unto Mount Carmel and Elijah came unto the people and said how long halt ye between two opinions if the Lord be God follow him but if bale them follow him and the people answered not a word isn't that striking may the Lord bless the reading of the word this evening as you have your seats you would think that after three and a half years of drought after three and a half years where food became so scarce and that water became so scarce and people were dying and cattle were dying and crops were failing in the field and that was such a challenge as this that the people would have been able to say something they should have they were a people that were called of God that there were there were a people that had followed the law of Moses that that had been raised up and had saw the revival of the times of Solomon and and knew of the exploits of David and and had read and told the stories of Moses and of the flood and and all of these things in it at least at this time under such great opposition in such great terrible like that they were under that at least some house somebody would have been able to say yes will will serve the Lord but they answered not a word I just find that to be very disturbing because I believe that as we see in the scripture that everything that we see brother Bram tells us that the Old Testament he said is the mother of the New Testament he tells us that the Old Testament was a types and shadows and how that those types and shadows would be reflected out and we would see Jesus Christ in every verse of scripture and so if that be the case then we would we would be able to say that as it was in the days of this Elijah and in the time of this a happened in the time of the this school of prophets and at this time where there was a the prophets of bail and and false teachers and false narrative and and faked news and all these other kind of things that was going on in this day that you would think Amen that we would be able to see that the self same thing has taken place in the hour that we live in and today the same same challenge this that there's the same voice of an elijah prophet has gone forth in this day hey man and said why halt you between two opinions if the Lord be gone then follow him and so Elijah brought this challenge the prophet of God said it was the Mount Carmel showdown in so Elijah brought the challenge and we know the story quite well and and how that the you know the the altar was built and the false prophets and the prophets of bale and and different ones that they stood there and they and they and they cut themselves and they went through all these exercises to me one of the great conundrums of this person this particular verse of scripture was that if the challenge was given to these men to to build an altar and to cut up a Bulacan and pour water upon it in and do all these things that and and and that there these men these four hundred prophets that there were there there had to be something I'm just saying this is there's nothing in the scripture that says this is this is just my observations as best that I can deduct from reading the scripture but but if if unless something like this this was not uncommon to these prophets this challenge was accepted and and and they went through with it and so they had to have believed or had to have some kind of witchery or some kind of supernatural something in their in their past or they would have never ever taken the challenge they would have said no this is they would have just backed out immediately but under their religion under their conception of what they believed was real and true they had to have believed that somehow that fire was going to come down and was going to vindicate them or they would have never taken that challenge so I have to say that for these men they had they had more about them than Billy Graham did because Billy Graham was given that same challenge by the Hindus and he turned it down and he walked away brother Brown said I would rather have gone there and failed than to let somebody challenge the Word of God and make fun of the Word of God he said I would have win away as a failure before i relent that make that challenge but the people answered not a word striking if you would turn with me over into 2nd Kings chapter 2 why ho Chi between two opinions I want to title the message tonight the Lord will help us be students of our time but I want to tile it I on the promise because the Bible says there then that Elijah that he offered that sacrifice he says at thy word according to the evening sacrifice as the way that you have shown me Elisha was was operating under a supernatural under a biblical mandate that had been handed down to him from God Almighty and he was standing there knowing because he had breslin said he had saw the vision of it and he was operating under that under that anointing that God was going to vindicate right and wrong we realized that that is the spirit that was upon Elijah that handed down now we find him here again in chapter 2 of 2nd Kings on Elisha I just want to kind of hit the high spots on this I'm gonna go quickly over this I'm not going to read everything I'm just going to use this as a point of reference but in Chapter 2 we find that Elijah is at the time that he's going to be taken up and so he takes Elijah Elijah with him we start at verse 1 of chapter 2 and it came to pass that when the Lord would take up Elijah into heaven by a whirlwind that Elijah went with Elijah to Gilgal and he like just said unto Elijah tarry here I pray thee for the LORD hath sent me to bettle and Elijah said unto him as the Lord liveth and as I so liveth I will not leave thee and so they went unto Bethel and so when they got to Bethel we find that there was a that there was a confrontation also that there was a school of prophets there but I say they were denominational believers but there was something striking about them that they knew that they had an understanding that this at this time that Elijah was going to be taken up and they came and they told Elijah they said look you know stay here with us join our group because you know after all your master is going to be taken away from your head today and we find that Elijah then he tells him mind your peace he said you're not telling me anything I don't already know so they were there were somehow there was a there was an understanding there was a revelation there was something that was happening that both the denominational group and the electro we're knowing the same thing I believe you would have to be spiritually know that there's that the that need the the the end of all things is right upon us I believe that you would have to be spiritually blind and and and completely ignorant of spiritual things to not know that the rapture is is is is upon us and and you got the denominational Czar saying it and you've got the independence that are saying it maybe they're not telling me anything I don't already know but the problem the difference is amen is home Amen do you got your eyes on they've got their eyes on their soothsayers and their dreamers in there and there visions and all these kind of things hey they're not telling me anything I don't already know I've been watching the time in the the word of a prophet they met for 36 plus years amen and he's been telling me keep your eye on the promise hallelujah but what we realize is that there's a message a man that comes with this catching away and without that messenger you will not see that rapture they'll be called away into great tribulation so he says you're not telling me anything I don't already know he said so just hold your peace in other words you haven't got a message that's going to get me in this rapture condition the only one that's got that is this elijah hallelujah and so the Bible says they went from there down to Jericho there they you know the the Prophet tells him because Elijah tells Elijah you know just wait here he said as the Lord liveth you know I'm not leave thee he takes him on he said I got to go to Jordan went to Jordan you know the story and brother Branham makes this statement here he said I don't care who you are I got the promise I'm going right on you say you know what the the pastor I don't care who you are I got my eye on the promise that's the way to get it keep your eye on the promise that's it stay with it hold on to it that's right listen now don't be jellyfish wishy-washy huh that's a that's a powerful vernacular right there huh that's literary genius don't be a jellyfish don't be wishy-washy how many times do we find in the Church of the Living God that people are wishy washy they're there in confusion they're going back and forth there's there's no there's no stability there's no steel in their backbone anymore oh I'll wash this way and I wish that way and I wish that way they'll wash that way well let me tell you the Bible says over in the book of James he said but let him ask in faith nothing wavering for he that wave earth is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed yes wishy-washy well let's not well I feel this way and I feel that way oh brother man said don't look at your symptoms look at Jonah he was down in the belly of a whale and his symptoms was all around him oh you talk about symptoms Billy I said that man had the first place he was back slidden the next place his hands and feet was tied behind him he was on a stormy sea the belly of the whale in the bottom of the sea and as he looked this way it was whale's belly he looked that way it was whales belly everywhere he looked was whales belly you talk about symptoms he had it there's nobody here in that condition tonight but What did he say he said they are all lying Vanity's I won't even look at him for the Bible says if you do you'll forsake your old mercy oh and where's she at my symptoms I'm washing out my circumstance oh I just look at this and look at that and what do you do you forsake your own mercy but the Bible says that he turned his face towards the temple but he turned over in vomit and seaweeds around his neck and belly in the belly of this whale and said Lord what's more I will look to your holy temple not to symptoms but at the temple he says why when Salomon dedicated the temple he prayed Lord if the people be in trouble at any time and look towards this holy place and pray then hear from Kevin and Jonah didn't add all those symptoms and call them lyin vanities watch because he had faith in the prayer of Solomon who dedicated that temple because he had he had been he was convinced he was convinced and then he was concerned and he knew that when that man prayed because God had ordained him to build that temple God had given him the instructions through his father David and he had the blueprints that was given by vision and David wrote those in those instructions down and gave them to Solomon and Solomon was operating on a super matte natural mandate on to build that temple and not only that but God had come behind that and gave Solomon a messiah sign had given him a gift of discernment and he was he was a voice of God for that day and that then and when when Jonah got in the situation that he was in he knew that if he would come back amen and then do what was on the tape even if he would come back and do maybe what God had said by his prophet messenger entering that God what set him free he kept his eye on the promise he knew what that masonic sign meant to him and he kept his eye on the prize both Church of the Living God if we could come tonight they better take what the prophet of God said and put our eye on that promise and not waver not be wishy-washy they better hold onto the the Bible says that he that does so say his life as a double minded man who is unstable in all of his ways or but I say God amen let me put my eye on the promise let me fix my face on it the Bible says like a flint amen that flint don't turn it don't turn right or left nothing but sparks come off you hit that that Flint it sparks a man it sets things on fire oh I say praise be to God let my face amen be like a flint and I'm not going to turn my life from the promise I want to be like Elijah and said as the Lord liveth I'm not gonna leave you I'm gonna keep my eye on this Elijah I'm gonna keep my eye on this message Amen I'm gonna keep my eye on what the messenger had to say I'm gonna follow it live or die I'm following it keeping my eye on the promise when they crossed over Jordan a man that old prophet took his mantle and struck the river Jordan the Bible says that the water went hither and thither and they walked across on dry ground oh it was just like in the days of Moses Amen when they went down through there sister Sarah amen and Moses came any raised up his staff through his nostrils amen and he blew in and they're in there and the this.c piled up on top of itself hey man and when he did the Bible says a minute wait a minute Sarah were talking about this today that the earth are deep underneath it congealed a man Oh hallelujah hey man he made a he made a super highway across that amen supernatural asphalt pavement hey man I made out of seashells and oh my is one of these one of these modern Oceanside highways and the children of Israel went way out on it and they went across that thing to million-strong oh my what was it that that God was showing Elijah and he was matching the old the old word that was in the Bible with the experience that he was getting brother Branham says that about the woman at the well that she began to match the old word with the experience that Jesus was given her he said when it did he said watch what happens quickly her sins were forgiven oh my you see what was happening aimin she came into a justified state she come underneath the messiah's of that day and that woman that was tainted on that in every way of her life she was she was married five times living with the six man oh what a what a an infidel you would say prostitute woman of ill Fame but instantly in the presence of Jesus Christ when she saw her day and it's mrs. quick paint her sins were forgiven those two pieces brother Graham said it was those two pieces of the laundry ticket that came together and she realized that she could be redeemed because she was redeemable from the beginning and there was Elijah and he saw the Old Testament amen being fulfilled right before his very eyes he saw that it was Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever and he knew that he was following the right message because the same words that their Moses did and Moses said the Lord your God shall raise up a prophet liken unto me hyrum you shall serve and now here he was a prophet was raised up with a Christ's ministry an anointing of Elijah hey man went for brother said the spirit of Elijah is the Spirit of Christ and so what did he do he saw his day he recognized his message and he kept his eye on that prophet also many want to turn you away from the Prophet and say that he wasn't here he wasn't there he was this or that or the other and try but all I can say is just push one play on one of them tapes and where brother man I'm standing there and telling that woman where she come from what was wrong with what was wrong with her husband and what was wrong with her stepdaughter not even a real daughter hello tell him where they were from they went from this city that was from another city he said and you say it's mine reading he said I don't know those people what was that it was a sign that was given to this last age there would only be given once to get the eyes of the people on the promise not on the man the man had faults and failures the man made mistakes I get that but the message that he sent brother Brown said it was a message of infallibility why because that message couldn't fail because it was Christ keep your eye on the promise when Solomon dedicated the temple the temple he prayed and said Lord if the people be in trouble at any time any place and under any circumstance didn't we have a messenger like that that come in this day a man What did he say the word works it cannot fail amen and when you under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit speak those words of God it is the same as if deity himself had spoken oh my friend when I know that I'm born again when I know I have the Holy Ghost down inside of my soul when I know beyond any shadow of a doubt that I'm a Christian and I love the Lord and I'm saved and if I die today hey man I'm gonna go to heaven that's why the scovia don't scare us it doesn't say doesn't scare God's children because they know Amen come what come well come what may you know you haven't you have is you have a better chance well I I don't like to say better you there there's a greater chance of you dying in an automobile accident and dying of kovat it's a truth run the statistics huh those weird I'm not afraid of dying in the car I mean I got I got I got here in one not too hot afraid of dying to covet if I get it and I die see on the other side there's no fear there why because my Bible says Amen that we don't fear or that we don't sorrow like those who have no hope we're not we're not like those that are that are that are that are without any any promise of a tomorrow so Satan can't can't can't strike us down with fear I'm not like the rest of this world it's out here in torment to me I think we give this covet way too much too much credit I think I think that's the thing to me the it's just a devil just like any other devil watch what he says here that at anytime and look towards this holy place and pray and hear from heaven and Jonah denied all those symptoms call them lying manatees because he had faith in the prayer of a man I don't know about you friends but brother Bram said that the hardest thing for God to do is to get one mortal to believe another one man to believe another all but here was a man that had the worst case of symptoms that I've ever seen one place the Bible says he was in hail I don't know if he wasn't even dead down there I don't know Jesus was dead every bit dead the body was scientifically I don't know how a man could live inside of a belly of a whale down there unless you believe in Pinocchio or something he got down in the belly of the whale one time that's just a fairy tale but at any rate whatever happened down here there for three days and three nights and the Bible says they went down he was in that he was in the in the Bell in there inhale inhale he lifted up his eyes the Bible says so I don't know what happened to him whether he physically was Dan Rafi was physically alive I don't know what was that going on down there but for whatever reason when the the days was up of the sign of Jonas was up because he was going to live out a prophecy of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus and so when that whether God put life back into him you can explain however you want to you know i whatever it was down there and that whale's belly when when God when it come time for him to come out he come out brilliant said that whale went up on the beach stuck his tongue out and he walked out on it like a gangplank and he walked out on the earth all no doubt it's three days in a whale's belly no telling what he looked like just a few hours in dishwater and my hands look terrible all shriveled up and everything I stay in the swimming pool for a long time when you go you get all pale and all shriveled up you know I'm talking about can you imagine what he looked like three days and whale vomit oh he must have been a sight but when he come out of there there was enough about him others quick and him power of God that he walked three days down into the middle of a city and caused a whole town to repent whatever it was why because he got his eyes off the symptoms and got his eyes on the prize he got his eyes off the the conditions he got his eyes off the corruption he got his eyes off of his own self they got his eyes off his own back slit condition he got his eyes off of his own inabilities Bream said he said the reason that he went down to tortious instead of going to Nineveh because he didn't believe he was that he had the ability to do it he was trusted in the arm of the flesh and the Bible says that's not wise to begin with and so when he got down there and got that boat oh my got a good preaching around that Jonah in the boat but let me tell you when he got out of there and got where God was supposed when he was supposed to go in the first place and he got his eyes on the promise that the thing that God told him he was going to do with him to begin with God did it and so much so that Jonah got upset he got upset he said you did what you said you were gonna do Lord and now what I guess Oh Jonah wanted him to get destroyed oh my we shouldn't take that approach you know there's a lot of people out there that that are really afraid there's a lot there's people out there they're really afraid of these things they're afraid of these this violence or afraid of all the you know these these race things and they're afraid of all these disease things and they're afraid of all these things there's any comfort you'll be it to many people do your best to comfort amen whoever you can watch this when as we get ready to close he said if Jonah could do that upon them circumstances what are we to do who don't look at solomon's temple but to heaven itself where Jesus sets at the right hand of God with his own promise to make intercessions upon our confession symptoms certainly not we deny them there's no such thing think about that we take God at His Word keep our eye on the promise and move on oh I think that's good advice tonight friends amen we deny the symptoms we deny the circumstances we deny them they don't exist they don't belong to us I'm not signing for him my brother Jules says I'm giving them rattlesnakes back I don't want them I'm not signing for him and because they don't exist in my mind they don't exist and then I'm gonna keep take God at His Word keep my eye on the promise and move on let's stand to our feet this evening some musicians return a little challenge maybe from this evening no doubt we have many more things that we could say but I just felt like the Lord kind of clinched that thought on the other side that maybe there's a neat or something that we need to pray about this evening we many many requests and brother Matt will bring those before you but maybe there's a special need here this evening you need prayer be glad to pray with you pray for you so we go to him this evening maybe that need is not something physical but something in that spiritual room that spiritual realm is the Bible says that we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against powers principalities and spiritual wickedness in high places but man said the highest place on earth is the heart of man and so maybe you're you're wrestling with something in your your breasts tonight something on your heart that's just troubled troubled on every side the Bible says but we sing that little chorus as I came to the platform cover me cover me when all seems hopeless cover me when my strength has gone maybe tonight you just been fighting this thing and wrestling with it maybe it's someone out on the on the livestream tonight and you're struggling your heart is troubled on every side and you wonder how you're even gonna make it through another day you just feel that you're just tired of fighting this thing maybe it's a physical thing but maybe it's a spiritual thing we

sorry friends but this is eagle anointing this is Malachi for anointing whoa let us rise up under that that great inspiration of revelations in 10 and 7 whoa let's fly high and keep our eye on the promise for heaven is just inside friends all that little Christian he got down to the to the River Jordan oh and it was a great fear there but he had one walking with him whose name was hopeful he took Christian by the hand and said let us go and they stepped into that cold river oh my let me tell you little Christian got scared in the waters and the billows rolled over the top of him and he thought he was going to die but hopeful said but look Christian there's their sure footing here oh there's the like and their foot caught hold and when they felt their sure footing they were able to walk out and those those angels were there to greet them hold children I believe that we're coming to that place like Elijah and Elijah oh it's time to smite the waters again oh let us smite the waters and let us walk over on dry land in Jesus name hallelujah oh praise the Lord Amen do you love him tonight oh I love him with all my heart friends praise be to God amen what are we what are we

got it all in control [Laughter] oh and then we want to take up the prayer requests that we have brother Luther we gathering on Wednesday up here distancing her to stay there what have we been doing staying gathering come on up front then hey man I got the permission from the Deacons so Amen just make your way with your family amen if you need to use just come close so that we can make sure we do this properly amen boy I appreciated the word tonight Amen did you appreciate that Amy give the Lord a hand clap of praise my goodness it was just so encouraging to me Amen I've looked at that same thing by the dáil deal with Jonah personally my opinion is he did die I have that opinion you know Jesus said it was the sign of Jonas who was in the belly of the whale the depths of hell and she hold for three days and and I believe that there were the miracle was the fact that you know not just the fact that he was in a Wells belly but that God rose him back up again I could be wrong I do know this and what got me tonight just that one part by the dáil amen appreciated the whole sermon there but what got me there was Jonah's reaction and you know the reason why he had that reaction I was struggled to remember the nation Nineveh wasn't just Ninevites but it was a nation that hated Israel and remember reading this just a week ago and Jonah and all honesty really when you look at the story he wanted them wiped off the face of the planet I mean because that's what God said God said if they don't repent I'm gonna wipe him out and so Jonah you know that's really what he wanted to happen he was ready to just commit suicide you know when he when it was all said and done it was just brokenhearted that God and God had to correcting and you know what it showed me I remember looking at this last just a week ago what it showed me is you know this world that we live in hates what we believe they hate Christianity now I'm not talking about I'm talking about the secular world they hate what you stand for they hate the faith that you have in your heart they hate your confession they hate your lifestyle because you are opposed you are against everything that they stand for their agenda and they've got an agenda and so they they mock us they mock the cross they mock believers and you know what the day of reckoning is coming God will judge the just and the unjust and but you know what let me say this so many times we get that in the heart but let me tell you we can become so affixed on judgment that we forget God is long-suffering we say Lord why is that why is you know he said scoffers what am I saying where's the promise of your coming and and and we say Lord what's going on you know how much more do they have to mock you and hate you before you just wipe them off you know but just as brother Branham was shown that blood strip that went all the way around showed his own sins and his own heart and I believe the Lord is long-suffering he's not willing that any should perish but that all should come to life and so he's not fixed on judgment that day is coming but right now there's still mercy there's still grace amen and so if they're still mercy and grace for me how much more we should extend that mercy and grace for others amen you know that that video we played last Wednesday I just got a few questions even about that and you know I said they said by the mat what do you what is your I thought I made it clear Wednesday and I said well I truly believe you know God could use that that man that Dana Dana Coverstone to give him a dream you know he used Abimelech gave him a dream gay pilots wife has dreams we use last Wednesday but that's not our message our message isn't go and quit our jobs our message isn't going by guns and and stockpile and canned goods we're getting out of here we're not gonna hear and we're not gonna be here before the first bomb Falls God will come there will be a secret setting catching away but is that a message maybe it's for the fullest version maybe it's to tell them to brace yourself you know while there say embrace yourself God say and get ready a man in the Bible says his bride hath made herself ready and so they're bracing ourselves I'm bracing myself and the world's changing and I'm about to change too and I really believe that that's not hype that's not hyperbole that's not pep rally that's the truth that's what I believe that's the assurance I have in my soul a change is coming this world's about to change and the bride is about to take a change amen and if anything it should do you know maybe maybe even that that dream that that man had would shake a believer if it would be God would use just to shake someone to their senses because I believe just like I do we all need to be shaken sometimes amen thank you brother Dale for that and that was wonderful keep your eyes on the promise amen give the Lord another hand keep your eyes on the word believe God could use a man so what brother Branham said he said when you said it's exactly what I was thinking the Prophet said the one of the hardest things God could get you to do is believe another man using the human agency think about the Jews man when jeho when it was God revealed in Jehovah no one want anything to do with him then when God revealed himself into Christ they all wanted to cling to Jehovah and reject the man Christ and now Christ is gone direct Christ is you know died and ascended and now they reject the current Living Word of the hour and that's the that's Christ in his body man never has a problem accepting God as a thought a picture book a coloring book a story a historical but we always have trouble believing God could use the agency of man but I'm so glad God used the agency of a prophet and sent him a vindicated word amen are you good are you grateful for that amen and that's what we should keep our eyes on is the word and then we have some prayer requests we want to take before you continue prayer for our sister Karen Pruitt for a full recovery sure many of you know the the situation there we talked about it last Wednesday continued prayer for this is I think the text came there

you have that you have answered in Jesus name we pray amen and amen hallelujah amen any testimonies if not we're gonna sing maybe one Burr Luther [Music] I just want to publicly thank the Lord for healing me from melanoma cancer and as a week ago I had an update with the doctor and he did a physical exam we were the tumor was gone after the first treatment it was gone but then I was still waiting for the lymph nodes to to reduce because they were still inflamed and enlarged and a week ago the physical exam all the lymph nodes were normal so I just have to praise the Lord I have three testimonies one of them it's going to go from the simplest to the the best anyway I was sleeping in my office today and that usually I don't sleep very well but I slept like 40 minutes and then I woke up about one o'clock and I called this guy that I had to do some work for wanted some information and the first thing he said when he picked up the phone he said tell me something good and I was like Jesus Christ the same yesterday saying forever is the first thing you come out of my mouth and I he goes well ain't nothing can top that but I was just caught unawares when I was traveling in Phoenix on the way home whatever but I went through security he got checked out and everything in the way they had a setup he had to go through the see security gate and I'm over on addy thing D gate so I go all the way down there and I sit down and then I'm like well I had about an hour and a half for my flight left so I wanted to get something to eat and when I've got something to eat and then I sat over where the desk was so I could see the lady come up so I'm flying standby and I wanted to check in earlier you check in more likely you're gonna be one of the first standbys that gets a flight so I go up there and I give him my security pass thing she goes you have your ID and I always have my stuff in order and everything you know I'm like mushing and half like and I pull out my wallet and I'm like and you get I'm starting to I can feel I'm starting to get nervous and sudden I'm like relax relax I'm like no I don't have it on me I go look at my luggage and everything and I'm like oh my goodness I'm like no I don't have it I lost it and so she goes we can go back to the security which is like you know the quarter-mile and and so I get all my stuff I got my food and this that I'm gonna bring a little thing in about the food but I I put it all back in the bag and I'm like I'm looking as I'm going back to security and then I get back there and I ask the supervisor says do you have an ID here or anything he's like no we don't but you can walk over there and look at everything some look I'm going every place I've been you know and I go over there and I look and I'm like man I'm not finding this thing you know and the whole time I'm like just calm down relax and so I turn around I go all the way back down to my gate and I'm like where I sat before I got my food there was two people sitting then I look under the seat and I'm like there's my license and I walked over that's as I excuse me I got to get my ID and so I was very thankful for that course then everything went calm cool and collected but the food thing my salad went sideways my dressing went all over in the bag and everything but the best we prayed for a woman at Bluffton library her name was Kathy and she had breast cancer and you know we we told I told her we'd pray for her and everything and I talked to her today I love this woman she she's just such a nice nice person and I said so how's it going with it and she said it's all gone and she just has to go every three months for an evaluation so that was the cherry on the top praise the Lord anybody else one more time for nobody where's Charles no you know how we take the prayer requests and lot of times you know if you're Watkins you do it digitally and but at the home Church there we've been they've been coming in a little paper slips that we write the prayer requests on and and they way they collect underneath the podium there and I just got this inspiration of the day and I gathered up I probably had 15 prayer requests that were under the podium and some that we're in always stick him in my Bible and I go back through them later and and what more but that particular Sunday morning I believe it was I just gathered them all up and I just in my mind I thought how many of these have been answered and I went through them I just want to testify every prayer request that I had in my BOB there had to be at least 15 on that round and that was slips of paper every single one of them the Lord had answered I and I just said you know so many times we bring the prayer requests but then do we come back and now you know I don't ever want to be like them that the tenth you know or the nine that didn't come back but the one came back and praise the Lord and so I just want to praise God in many answers in every request every request praise God thankful for parents and God we're gonna let you go he's got it all in control we'll sing it again and then see a Sunday keep I know they were that my kids call this a cringe moment but for my parents but I'm gonna say this keep them in prayer my mom and my dad I know they're watching tonight and they need prayer just through this entire trial amen you care for a lot of people you give yourself to a lot of people then sometimes amen you need someone else to look to pray for you and to lift you up in prayer so remember them amen we're gonna get the victory but just I know this has been this last couple weeks week so it's been real tough amen and so we're we are remembering them tonight amen look for it you love the Lord look forward to seeing everybody this Sunday amen just as you're dismissing it as you go he's got it all in control [Laughter] oh he's got it all in control oh he put that reassurance way down in my soul God's got it all in control I put my life in ease I
