[36:01] church today so don't forget it because
[36:03] I've given her amen authority to execute
[36:07] capital punishment amen
[36:11] so she was
[36:18] happy so uh
[36:22] anyway Genesis chapter 1 real familiar
[36:26] reading
[36:27] for us and I want to I'm going I send it
[36:29] to the booth specifically because we're
[36:31] going to have to skip a little bit and
[36:33] I'm not going to read everything in
[36:35] order to be too much but we want to
[36:38] catch verse 24 of Genesis chapter
[36:44] 1 verse
[36:47] 24 and God said let the Earth bring
[36:51] forth the living creature after his kind
[36:54] cattle and after his kind cattle and
[36:58] creeping thing and beast of the earth
[37:00] after his kind and it was
[37:03] so and God made the Beast of the earth
[37:06] after his kind and cattle after their
[37:09] kind and everything that creepeth upon
[37:11] the Earth after his kind and God saw
[37:16] that it was good
[37:19] amen chapter
[37:22] 2 verse
[37:25] 8
[37:32] I did not I'm sorry let's go finish back
[37:34] in chapter one
[37:39] verse no oh yeah let's read verse 26
[37:42] chapter one and God said let us make man
[37:44] in our image after our likeness let them
[37:47] have dominion over the fish of the sea
[37:50] so you can see
[37:52] why that
[37:54] it there should there's no
[37:57] ambiguity in what a child of God is
[38:00] they're made in His
[38:01] image so that you've heard me talk about
[38:05] when I'm speaking at Men's meetings and
[38:06] I'm speaking to young men I'm saying
[38:09] remember it's an office manhood is an
[38:11] office not not an entitlement because of
[38:14] a gender not just because you're a male
[38:16] as brother brandham said I've seen men
[38:18] 200 pound 6 foot 200 pounds didn't have
[38:20] anounce of man in him because what is a
[38:23] man it's a man living in the image of
[38:26] his maker
[38:27] right but he made male and female made
[38:29] he them and so made he him and so it's
[38:33] it's that's the image of God if you're a
[38:35] child of God you live in the image of
[38:37] God which means you live you look like
[38:39] the
[38:40] word you talk like the word you think
[38:43] like the word you dress like the word
[38:45] you act like the word you react like the
[38:49] word which is what generally gets us in
[38:51] more trouble than our actions our
[38:53] reactions amen amen so uh it's very
[38:58] clear it's it's in pretty clear language
[39:00] to me and God said let us make man in
[39:03] our image after our likeness and let
[39:06] them have dominion over the fish of the
[39:08] sea so it's so your dominion and your
[39:10] Authority and everything is all tied in
[39:14] the proper image of the word and what
[39:17] your faith is and how you conduct
[39:20] yourself is that
[39:24] easy over the foul of the air over the
[39:26] cattle and over all the Earth and over
[39:27] every creeping thing that creepeth upon
[39:30] the Earth so that's what he did he
[39:32] thought it was a good idea so God
[39:34] created man in his own image in the
[39:36] image of God created he him male and
[39:38] female created he them and then God
[39:40] blessed them and said be fruitful and
[39:43] multiply replenish the Earth and subdue
[39:45] it have dominion and he goes on and on
[39:48] there so so the The Authority just like
[39:52] I was preaching Wednesday that your we
[39:56] are made made Kings and Priests and the
[39:59] authority of your kingship is grounded
[40:01] in your priesthood because Jesus being
[40:04] the King of Kings yet he's a priest he
[40:06] abideth continually a priest Forever
[40:08] After the order of mzc which was a type
[40:10] of the Bride that's why brother Bram
[40:12] went there constantly to show what
[40:15] you're seeing is the word made flesh now
[40:17] in the body of Christ amen simple stuff
[40:21] all right now chapter
[40:22] 2 verse 8 and the Lord God planted a
[40:26] garden Eastward in Eden and there he put
[40:30] the man whom he formed and out of the
[40:34] ground made the Lord God to grow every
[40:36] tree that is Pleasant to the sight and
[40:40] good for food the tree of life also in
[40:44] the midst of the garden and the tree of
[40:46] knowledge of Good and Evil now drop down
[40:51] to verse
[40:53] 15 and the Lord God took the man and put
[40:57] him in the Garden of Eden to dress it
[40:59] and to keep it and the Lord God
[41:02] commanded the man saying of every tree
[41:05] of the garden thou mayest freely eat but
[41:09] of the tree of of the knowledge of Good
[41:12] and Evil Thou shalt not eat of it for in
[41:16] the day that thou eatest thereof Thou
[41:19] shalt surely
[41:21] die all right amen let's
[41:25] pray
[41:26] father we thank you for your word today
[41:29] and I ask for your divine blessing upon
[41:31] it bless both speaker and hearer we
[41:35] humble ourselves we have humbled
[41:37] ourselves and as brother Brenham said I
[41:39] humbled myself again Lord I stand here
[41:42] and fresh now I humble myself again
[41:45] before your great presence we commit all
[41:48] the teaching of the word into your hands
[41:50] teach us Lord in Jesus name we pray amen
[41:53] God bless you friends you can be seated
[41:58] if you will allow me just right quick
[42:00] before I get going I want to fix a
[42:02] little um a little statement I made
[42:05] almost like a typo in speech I knew it
[42:07] when I I actually knew it but I didn't
[42:10] catch it until after I got home and I
[42:14] woke up Monday morning and my eyeballs
[42:16] came straight awake and I went oh my
[42:18] gosh did I say that no that's not
[42:20] scriptural and so and so I bounded out
[42:23] of the bed and ran quickly and please
[42:25] please tell me I didn't say that tell me
[42:27] I didn't say that and sure enough I
[42:29] did so uh I just wanted to make a quick
[42:33] correction I like I say I knew it from
[42:35] childhood from Sunday school we all knew
[42:38] that the two daughters that lot remember
[42:41] he had more than the two daughters
[42:42] living at home brother Brown talks about
[42:44] he had married daughters who had married
[42:46] among Society but he had two daughters
[42:48] at home that the Bible cus them maidens
[42:50] they had not known a man and I kind of
[42:53] used a wide brush and washed all the
[42:55] daughters painted all the daughters in
[42:57] the same light and that wasn't actually
[42:59] scripturally accurate not that brother
[43:01] brandham said that but I said it and uh
[43:04] it was um presumptuous and incorrect so
[43:07] I just wanted to fix that right quick
[43:08] just in case uh someone might hear that
[43:12] and wonder and say hey that's not
[43:14] according to Genesis and it's not so now
[43:17] the the point I was making is still
[43:19] valid because they they they were of a
[43:23] of a character like all the rest of the
[43:25] family the point I was making was that
[43:27] here was the point I was making not to
[43:29] be lost on the
[43:31] misspeak uh is the point I was making is
[43:34] that the family of lot became poisoned
[43:39] and contaminated by lot's decision to
[43:42] live in
[43:43] Sodom that's the point and you see that
[43:46] their son-in-laws you know took it all
[43:49] as a big joke and a big haha his wife
[43:51] turned to a pillar of salt his daughters
[43:54] who even the even the ones who married
[43:56] among Society they didn't leave with him
[43:59] and the ones who did got him drunk
[44:01] through through through uh an incestuous
[44:04] affair and and then we realize that even
[44:06] those Nations later on cease to exist
[44:10] okay so we were showing the the
[44:12] difference there between lot as a
[44:14] foolish virgin because he did have a
[44:16] righteous soul and we learn by Matthew
[44:19] 25 that that was the differentiating
[44:22] mark between those who had done all
[44:24] kinds of work works for God and and but
[44:28] it was iniquitous and they were
[44:29] destroyed and those who really couldn't
[44:31] remember doing anything for God but they
[44:33] got eternal life because they were
[44:35] righteous so you you don't you don't you
[44:38] you you don't refer to lot's whole
[44:41] family as foolish virgin only lot as far
[44:44] as I can see in the Bible nonetheless uh
[44:47] I just wanted to make that quick
[44:48] correction now recapping if you will
[44:51] give me just a minute I just want to
[44:53] take maybe five or 10 minutes to recap
[44:56] from part eight because I'm really going
[44:59] into it today more deeply and the point
[45:03] that we were
[45:05] making as we were finishing part eight
[45:08] and I know this because I went back and
[45:10] looked to see what I had said there in
[45:12] the last 10 15 minutes uh that we were
[45:16] we were making the point that that Godly
[45:19] morals and this is really wow is this a
[45:22] big point so I really want to just
[45:25] launch with this one I want it just
[45:27] burned into your mind that that Godly
[45:31] morals and
[45:33] Holiness are embedded in the love of
[45:38] God see so and I say that to
[45:43] counteract the poisonous ideology of
[45:47] today that Godless loves us and it
[45:50] doesn't matter how we live amen like the
[45:54] whole world's going to heaven because we
[45:56] love God and people can live like filthy
[46:00] Sinners but because they say I love
[46:03] Jesus or because they as brother Brandon
[46:06] would say admire the fine qualities of
[46:10] Jesus and they have a a beautiful
[46:13] thought about Jesus and they talk you
[46:16] know very beautifully about him and the
[46:18] love of God and the forgiveness and you
[46:20] know but but yet there's no effective
[46:23] change in their lives and the point to
[46:26] be made is that that that's not the love
[46:28] of God that's a man-made watered down
[46:32] error God's love is even
[46:35] corrective brother brandham called the
[46:38] even the terrible torment that befell
[46:42] the Jews during the second world war as
[46:45] the tender hand of Jehovah love of God
[46:48] is
[46:49] corrective the house this is this is a
[46:52] house of correction see but we do it by
[46:56] showing you that God loves you too much
[47:00] to leave you like he found
[47:03] you man so and and I and I and I really
[47:07] want to show and
[47:09] demonstrate that that the fact that
[47:12] morals and Holiness are embedded in his
[47:14] love that that is actually part of an
[47:17] eternal teaching that's not a new
[47:19] teaching uh that's not even a
[47:21] restoration back to uh uh not that's not
[47:24] even just the restoration of the message
[47:27] of the hour back to the faith of the
[47:28] fathers it even predates the fathers it
[47:31] goes all the way back to the Eden story
[47:35] in Genesis and so we were we were ending
[47:39] part eight uh saying how that that the
[47:43] real correct version of God's love flies
[47:46] in the face face of a modern
[47:48] interpretation of it it brings literally
[47:52] making the statements that I'm making it
[47:55] literally br brings the true word of God
[47:57] into direct conflict with the message of
[48:00] the modern church amen uh about God so
[48:04] loving the world and so he did so love
[48:08] the world that he gave his only begotten
[48:10] son but not to just leave it like it is
[48:14] see
[48:15] so I'll keep going all right let me just
[48:17] keep moving so and then the second point
[48:20] that I made right as I was ending part
[48:23] eight was that the word word of God
[48:26] being Eternal you remember we broke that
[48:28] down there's no old word it's just
[48:31] either original or not original so
[48:34] brother brandham didn't come and preach
[48:36] the spoken word is the old seed he
[48:39] preached the spoken word is the Original
[48:41] Seed so there's no oldfashioned it's
[48:44] just the word it's the same today as it
[48:47] was yesterday and it'll be the same
[48:49] tomorrow and for as many tomorrows as
[48:52] are remaining and then when tomorrows
[48:54] are a thing of the past
[48:56] see brother Jason was making that so
[48:59] clear today in what in the world that
[49:01] we're going to and so we realize that
[49:05] that that being the case and now here
[49:08] I'm really coming to a real theme in my
[49:10] heart that I want to spend some time on
[49:13] is that since the word of God is eternal
[49:17] then that invalidates any idea it
[49:20] invalidates any teaching that came to us
[49:24] from Elijah the prophet Propet in our
[49:27] day the the teachings that he taught
[49:31] about decency and morality and
[49:36] Holiness the fact that the word not just
[49:39] what he taught but the example he
[49:42] lived I'm I'm gonna keep preaching
[49:45] whether I don't get many amens or
[49:47] not and and not only the way he lived
[49:50] but the plain
[49:52] instructions for the way that we should
[49:55] live
[49:56] yeah in this modern world they are it
[50:00] because the word is eternal it it
[50:03] invalidates any argument that would try
[50:06] to say well what he said in 65 is not
[50:11] valid in
[50:12] 2023 it's not incumbent upon us we can
[50:15] water it down this is a modern day that
[50:17] was just his
[50:19] opinion and I end I ended by pointing
[50:22] you back to the Paul to the Apostle Paul
[50:25] saying
[50:26] that this is me not the Lord I think I
[50:29] have the mind of the Lord but here's my
[50:31] advice on it and this is me not the Lord
[50:34] do you think you can toss that out
[50:37] because Paul said this is me not the
[50:39] Lord see so they're just as valid today
[50:43] as they were in
[50:44] 65 so when he went down the line uh to
[50:48] of of what correct decency and morality
[50:51] and Holiness is and how we should
[50:54] conduct ourselves
[50:56] the things that we uh should and
[50:59] shouldn't participate in all the way
[51:02] down to how we dress how we act whether
[51:06] in church whether in public Even in our
[51:09] homes
[51:12] yes because if you're a Christian
[51:14] there's nowhere the Holy Ghost
[51:16] isn't so why would it matter whether you
[51:19] were in church in front of Believers or
[51:22] in the privacy of your home or on a
[51:24] street where you you think no one's
[51:27] watching you know I mean if you think
[51:29] you're born again if you believe that
[51:31] then the Holy Ghost is is abideth it
[51:34] abides forever see and so and I and I I
[51:38] was making the point and this is my last
[51:41] recap point and I'm going to move
[51:44] forward that the
[51:47] teaching if you w to humanize overh
[51:50] humanize now a healthy amount of
[51:53] humanizing William brandom is a good
[51:55] thing
[51:55] because you've got to separate the man
[51:58] born in
[52:02] sin
[52:04] amen the man who ran from the presence
[52:06] of
[52:07] God and laid there with slim playing
[52:11] that that handmade you know where he had
[52:14] a read through a comb and and played it
[52:16] down at the cross where my savior died
[52:19] and 18-year-old Billy brandham looking
[52:22] at those stars above him and he could
[52:25] said I it's like I could hear in the
[52:26] wind Adam son where are you and he said
[52:31] I I I I quickly covered my head I didn't
[52:34] want them to see me crying and I said
[52:36] please sir don't destroy me until I can
[52:39] find out who you are
[52:42] yes
[52:43] see and so we we we realize that you you
[52:49] you've got to think about the office
[52:51] that he
[52:52] had and the fact that he's a man that
[52:55] had flaws and ups and downs and like
[52:58] passions like me and like
[53:00] Elijah who was a man of like passions
[53:02] brother Bram said that many he had his
[53:04] ups and downs oh that's so comforting
[53:06] I'm sorry that that brother Brenham
[53:08] outed Elijah like that but the Apostle
[53:11] had done it before brother brandham did
[53:13] so Elijah just have to deal with it I'm
[53:16] sorry great prophet but we happen to
[53:18] know you got outed you had your ups and
[53:21] downs too like
[53:23] me but you loved God like me and you
[53:27] kept coming back like
[53:30] me and he kept forgiving you like me
[53:36] Hallelujah but we find that that office
[53:39] had a certain
[53:41] degree a an authority so much
[53:46] so so much
[53:48] Authority did this Kentucky hillbury
[53:52] born in sin with ups and downs
[53:56] so much Authority did God place in the
[53:59] office he held that he was empowered to
[54:03] authoritatively indict the entire world
[54:08] as guilty of the second crucifixion of
[54:11] Jesus Christ and said I do this in his
[54:15] name in the presence of the judge
[54:18] himself amen he was the certifying Angel
[54:22] sent to John the angel sent to John
[54:26] clearly was a prophet from the future
[54:29] John was transported to the day of the
[54:32] Lord and to the to the time of judgment
[54:35] and he he tries to worship this
[54:37] certifying Angel who is a prophet from
[54:41] the future and and we we realize then
[54:44] that you can say well he was just a man
[54:47] or he had just an opinion but I'm here
[54:49] to tell you his teaching and his
[54:51] lifestyle and what he said about us was
[54:54] certified by the angel of the
[54:57] Lord by his presence who fellowshipped
[55:00] this Prophet on a regular
[55:06] basis so I denounce as
[55:11] heresy any idea that we can water down
[55:16] what a prophet taught when it comes to
[55:18] Holiness standards and morality and our
[55:22] responsibility to God if you're going to
[55:25] be a believer then please be one all the
[55:28] way and if you if you if you make
[55:31] mistakes well you're like me just Own It
[55:33] repent for it and go on but
[55:37] don't let your life be a statement that
[55:40] is contrary to what has been
[55:44] taught I get we make mistakes I
[55:48] understand that that's not what I'm
[55:49] talking about so did brother Brandon
[55:51] make mistakes that's not what we're
[55:53] talking about we have human Frailty so
[55:56] did he we're not talking about that I'm
[55:58] talking about what's the desire of your
[56:00] heart in your heart do you believe uh do
[56:04] you believe what has been sent they
[56:05] asked Jesus how do we do the works he
[56:07] said here's how you do it believe on him
[56:10] whom God has
[56:12] sent say that was Jesus who do you think
[56:14] was in Elijah who do you think's in
[56:17] you
[56:21] amen Lower Court decisions
[56:26] can only be changed altered or
[56:29] countermanded by higher courts yes until
[56:33] finally you get all the way to what we
[56:35] call here our Supreme Court and it's
[56:38] commonly a western term our supreme
[56:41] court whether you
[56:43] have you know whether you have uh uh a
[56:48] democracy or whether you have a
[56:51] theocracy like or you know like they
[56:54] have in the middle midd East uh they
[56:56] have a
[56:57] supreme decision and and that's it and
[57:01] so you have the Supreme Court and so so
[57:05] anyone coming along now to to overturn
[57:10] the standards of the Believers here at
[57:14] the end time those those claims are
[57:18] invalid see because we already have the
[57:24] decision vision from the unchanging
[57:27] Supreme Court of
[57:30] Heaven now mankind has that's not a
[57:33] That's Not
[57:34] Unusual that's not bad I'm not it's not
[57:38] I'm not even saying something polit
[57:40] Politically Incorrect for goodness sake
[57:43] mankind has sought to bring forth Law
[57:46] and Order since the beginning of time
[57:49] the most ancient civilizations the most
[57:52] ancient dynasties have attempted
[57:55] uh in various ways to make their laws
[57:59] unchangeable immutable and
[58:02] irreversible that's not a new thing man
[58:05] is made in the image of God see so they
[58:08] would they would carve them in solid
[58:11] Stone they would write them on parchment
[58:13] and store them in Secure vaults you can
[58:16] read these things and you with a study
[58:18] of history you find um especially if you
[58:22] read in the book of Ezra about the and
[58:23] the Book of ES and and these various
[58:26] places you'll find that the laws of the
[58:29] mes and the Persians was supposed to be
[58:32] immutable and unchangeable and in fact
[58:35] is that worked in Ezra's favor Ezra and
[58:38] Nehemiah when they went back to rebuild
[58:41] that we found that a former King had
[58:44] given them permission had given them a
[58:47] building permit something we can't seem
[58:49] to
[58:53] get but they gave he gave them a royal
[58:56] building permit and gave them money from
[58:59] the treasury government
[59:01] Treasury and in fact is the Ezra was of
[59:06] such high
[59:08] caliber Ezra had such a
[59:11] reputation uh among the Royal Court that
[59:16] they he was told you don't even need to
[59:19] keep receipts
[59:22] Ezra our trust in you is in emphatic you
[59:25] don't even need to return a report
[59:28] here's the money and here's a letter to
[59:31] all the governors and Mayors and police
[59:33] and everybody where you go if anybody
[59:35] gets in your way I will kill their
[59:37] family I'll kill them I'll kill their
[59:39] animals I'll kill
[59:43] everybody that's how much the king
[59:45] respected so when they then that King
[59:48] passes away and another one comes in who
[59:50] don't know nothing about that and then
[59:52] when the political movement starts up up
[59:54] against Israel rebuilding they start
[59:56] writing letters you need to stop this
[59:58] your majesty these are rebellious people
[1:00:01] if they get inside of a w city you'll
[1:00:03] never get them out and you know this
[1:00:06] king is shocked oh my goodness we we
[1:00:08] better do something about this and and
[1:00:10] so they send a cease and desist you got
[1:00:12] to stop right now well Ezra just writes
[1:00:16] back and says but we have documentation
[1:00:20] from your predecessor well when he hears
[1:00:23] that he's terrified
[1:00:25] because now he knows oh my goodness I've
[1:00:27] violated the
[1:00:28] unviable I'm changing the laws of mes
[1:00:31] and Persians and quickly go search the
[1:00:34] records quickly go go over to the uh to
[1:00:36] the to the Vault and and see if this is
[1:00:38] valid and they come back and they said
[1:00:40] indeed it is that that a former King uh
[1:00:43] he gave permission for this he said well
[1:00:47] and he tore up the the uh the the order
[1:00:50] the cease and desist and he
[1:00:53] reestablished that the these people were
[1:00:55] to be left alone to finish their
[1:00:57] job so so you read that I mean all the
[1:01:00] way back to Magna Carta you can find
[1:01:03] mankind trying to preserve the idea that
[1:01:07] we need let's come up with a onized
[1:01:11] fits-all law that will cover everything
[1:01:15] we can face and if we ever come up to a
[1:01:18] situation we'll come back to this
[1:01:20] document and this will give us
[1:01:23] guidance
[1:01:25] the problem is that here we have no
[1:01:29] continuing
[1:01:30] City so it didn't matter that the
[1:01:33] ancient Babylonians did it or the
[1:01:35] Egyptians did it or the mes and Persians
[1:01:37] did it or or the you know the English
[1:01:40] courts in the Middle Ages or our
[1:01:43] founding fathers you know we don't have
[1:01:45] a continuing City mankind is perpetually
[1:01:49] getting
[1:01:50] worse see and so even the last attempt
[1:01:54] attempt to establish uh the best
[1:01:56] government on Earth which of course
[1:01:58] would have been as the lightning had
[1:02:00] traveled from the East to the west and
[1:02:02] come here in America and God establishes
[1:02:05] our founding fathers to establish a
[1:02:08] constitutional republic people think
[1:02:10] we're democracy that's in some ways true
[1:02:13] it's a bit of a misnomer we're actually
[1:02:15] a constitutional republic when Ben
[1:02:17] Franklin left uh there in in
[1:02:20] Philadelphia and walked out on the
[1:02:21] street after all of the deliberation and
[1:02:23] Lady asking this a fact his fact of
[1:02:25] history uh Mr um Franklin what do we
[1:02:28] have he says Madam you have a republic
[1:02:31] if you can hang on to it if you can keep
[1:02:33] it I think were his
[1:02:34] words so and because you know it's a
[1:02:38] constitutional republic a democracy
[1:02:39] basically just saying um I mean if if if
[1:02:44] if the whole nation
[1:02:46] votes you know that that we Le let's
[1:02:50] let's let's go back to a heinous time if
[1:02:52] the whole nation votes that we should
[1:02:54] have slaves and every minority black and
[1:02:57] brown and yellow should serve the whites
[1:03:00] if the nation votes for that in majority
[1:03:02] than a democracy that's it that becomes
[1:03:04] the law but a constitutional republic
[1:03:07] says just a second we're going to write
[1:03:09] a document that's going to fly in the
[1:03:12] face of that you're going to have to
[1:03:14] establish it and they made a they made a
[1:03:16] gallant effort to do that and Men of God
[1:03:21] uh Men Christian men tried to establish
[1:03:23] it but the problem was
[1:03:26] sin problem is sin that's why when
[1:03:28] Israel wanted a law and and and God gave
[1:03:32] them a law just to prove to him they
[1:03:34] couldn't keep
[1:03:35] it see and and Paul said you know sin
[1:03:40] took advantage of the law and took
[1:03:41] advantage of me was the law that was
[1:03:44] supposed to be for my good ended up
[1:03:45] being for my death God didn't design it
[1:03:48] that way the problem wasn't with God or
[1:03:50] his word the problem was with me I was
[1:03:53] sinful and so sin took advantage and
[1:03:55] slew me that's why Jesus came and put us
[1:03:59] Above the Law and set us up in Grace but
[1:04:02] I'm here to tell you that's only valid
[1:04:04] in your life when you're born again of
[1:04:06] the spirit of God you don't get that by
[1:04:09] just admiring the fine qualities of
[1:04:11] Jesus and joining a church you don't get
[1:04:14] that because you even if you say God
[1:04:15] sent a prophet his name was William
[1:04:17] brandom and I believe it the devil knows
[1:04:19] that and believes the same thing but I'm
[1:04:22] here to tell you the baptism of the the
[1:04:24] holy spirit in the New Birth makes you a
[1:04:26] new creation in Christ Jesus no bones
[1:04:30] about it aren't pulling any punches it
[1:04:32] makes you a different
[1:04:35] person will you do still because you're
[1:04:37] you're still in a fallen body more about
[1:04:40] that in a little bit but and and that's
[1:04:42] why it's the greatest battle ever fall
[1:04:44] but in your heart your whole desires
[1:04:46] have turned northward you're looking for
[1:04:48] the kingdom whose Builder and maker is
[1:04:53] God so the latest attempt to establish
[1:04:57] the best government on
[1:04:58] Earth uh a constitutional republic
[1:05:01] actually was an experiment I don't know
[1:05:03] if you realize that but that's it was
[1:05:05] actually an experiment it never been
[1:05:07] tried and and and and Lincoln actually
[1:05:11] at Gettysburg wasn't even sure it could
[1:05:13] survive he's the one who coined that
[1:05:15] phrase a government of the People by the
[1:05:17] people and for the people that's not
[1:05:19] actually in the constitution of the Bill
[1:05:20] of Rights that's what Lincoln said and
[1:05:21] they adopted and said that's what we are
[1:05:24] and Lincoln is standing there not sure
[1:05:26] but he hoped that it would never perish
[1:05:29] from the earth he he makes that clear in
[1:05:31] his Gettysburg address we we're here to
[1:05:33] see if this form of government can
[1:05:37] survive and we see that the last you
[1:05:40] know here here's the problem that that
[1:05:44] we were the last best chance for it
[1:05:48] they' been trying it since ancient
[1:05:51] Babylon been trying it since nimrod
[1:05:54] understand they realized that every man
[1:05:57] just doing what was right in his own
[1:05:59] eyes coming out of Eden that wasn't
[1:06:01] working out so good the world you know
[1:06:04] uh ended up in an anti- deluvian
[1:06:06] destruction and so after the flood man
[1:06:09] or begins to organize and Nimrod is
[1:06:12] actually the first one to do that he's
[1:06:13] the first one to carry War to his
[1:06:15] neighbors and and so you're you're
[1:06:17] seeing civilization and and they're
[1:06:19] trying to establish it we get all the
[1:06:21] way down to our to our last day and the
[1:06:24] lightning has landed here in the west
[1:06:26] and it's it's it's on the east coast and
[1:06:28] on the west coast and after you go
[1:06:29] beyond that you're headed back East
[1:06:31] again and so the last best chance to get
[1:06:34] it
[1:06:35] right after thousands of years since the
[1:06:40] flood and the last best chance we see
[1:06:43] that the last best chance is swung you
[1:06:47] know uh from the left back to the right
[1:06:50] and then back to the left again all by
[1:06:52] politics and public opinion
[1:06:55] so that even your Supreme our Supreme
[1:06:58] Court can't even establish a law it's
[1:07:02] only there as long as the political
[1:07:04] ideology of the day allows it and
[1:07:06] supports it as soon as men change their
[1:07:09] mind the Supreme Court gets its its its
[1:07:12] decisions changed and overturned say
[1:07:15] well if it's a bad one shouldn't it be
[1:07:16] overturned sure that's the whole point
[1:07:19] is that yeah I get it it's it's it's the
[1:07:22] best way that we can come up within the
[1:07:25] earth a constitutional republic with
[1:07:27] three separate branches of government
[1:07:30] trying to balance each other out but but
[1:07:33] my point is the best laid plans of mice
[1:07:37] and men has
[1:07:40] failed there's only one Supreme
[1:07:43] Court there's only one supreme judge and
[1:07:46] we had the highest judge uh send the
[1:07:50] last star in his right hand this was the
[1:07:54] last one he had he had already deployed
[1:07:57] six of them and he's got the last one
[1:07:59] left and he sends him into the Earth and
[1:08:02] he establishes h an unchangeable code of
[1:08:06] what real Holiness is what real morality
[1:08:09] is what real Christianity is what really
[1:08:13] the Holy Ghost
[1:08:16] is and God Vindicated his
[1:08:20] ministry there's not another star coming
[1:08:24] there's no further discussion to have or
[1:08:27] decision to be made or standard to hold
[1:08:31] our standard to change you know we have
[1:08:36] the absolute last will and testament of
[1:08:39] the Angel of the Lord on how we should
[1:08:43] conduct ourselves as
[1:08:48] Believers so you disregard those
[1:08:51] teachings at your own peril
[1:08:55] yes sir if you don't conduct your
[1:08:59] family if fathers aren't in their
[1:09:03] homes conducting themselves in the
[1:09:05] office the way the message taught then
[1:09:08] you do that at your own
[1:09:10] Peril if mothers don't Pastor their
[1:09:12] children according to the standards that
[1:09:15] God sent from that last star in his
[1:09:17] right hand then if you don't follow that
[1:09:20] you do so at your own Peril say can God
[1:09:23] still rescue thank God he can can he
[1:09:25] still help me praise God he can he does
[1:09:28] he because none of us get it right all
[1:09:30] the time but I'm glad of God is rich in
[1:09:33] Mercy it's not what I'm preaching on
[1:09:35] today I'm preaching on the fact that we
[1:09:38] cannot move aside you can't move the
[1:09:41] ancient landmarks God has established
[1:09:44] the last will in Testament and it's
[1:09:46] never going to change and I and you say
[1:09:49] is the rapture coming soon I believe
[1:09:51] it's already overdue and should be here
[1:09:53] by tomorrow
[1:09:54] but if it's not here for another hundred
[1:09:56] years and I pass away my last breath as
[1:09:59] a pastor is going to be you can't change
[1:10:02] the decision
[1:10:04] [Applause]
[1:10:05] made that's right see can't change
[1:10:11] it the great principle and it's it's
[1:10:14] such a a
[1:10:16] disease that we're facing in this
[1:10:20] hour and it was the devil's
[1:10:25] intentional plan to try to raise and
[1:10:29] discredit the messenger that's what you
[1:10:31] do when you've got an unimpeachable
[1:10:33] witness you try to impeach
[1:10:36] him when you've got an actual eyewitness
[1:10:39] which is what William Brandon was he was
[1:10:40] an eyewitness to what God
[1:10:43] wanted he was he spoke to the angel of
[1:10:46] the Lord face to face on many
[1:10:50] occasions and he his message was
[1:10:52] certified by an Angel so Satan what what
[1:10:56] can Satan do he can't it wouldn't do him
[1:10:58] any good to attack God so he attacks the
[1:11:01] star and he tries to invalidate so that
[1:11:04] it puts it in people's mind his his his
[1:11:08] listen friends his plan was never so
[1:11:11] grandiose as to think that he was going
[1:11:14] to get the bride around the world to
[1:11:16] abandon the message that would have been
[1:11:19] sheer stupidity Satan's not a dummy but
[1:11:22] what he did is like in like with balum
[1:11:25] and the Feast of B peor he he
[1:11:28] discredited the messenger in in the
[1:11:30] minds of enough people to where they
[1:11:33] begin to say well his teachings don't
[1:11:35] exactly matter it's not incumbent upon
[1:11:38] me I can wear short skirts trim my hair
[1:11:41] paint my face up I can drink casually
[1:11:43] and cuss and run around it it doesn't
[1:11:45] matter and that's what they do and it's
[1:11:47] called message light it's a watered down
[1:11:49] version It's it come from the devil it's
[1:11:52] going back to the the
[1:11:56] devil oh I've said it before a woman
[1:11:59] cutting her hair and wearing pants is
[1:12:02] not a William brandham
[1:12:03] teaching the fact that he came and is
[1:12:06] gone you won't have to face him on that
[1:12:08] day if you do it sister a woman not
[1:12:11] cutting her hair is a Paul Doctrine a
[1:12:14] woman not putting on a garment that
[1:12:16] pertains to a man is a Moses doctor
[1:12:19] you're not going to have to worry about
[1:12:21] brother brandham uh saying why did did
[1:12:23] you not listen to me you're going to
[1:12:25] have to face Paul and Moses good luck
[1:12:27] with
[1:12:31] that I don't expect that to end well for
[1:12:36] you I don't care what you've
[1:12:38] accomplished or what you claim to be
[1:12:41] your life speaks louder than your
[1:12:45] words so it's all about the great
[1:12:48] principle of spiritual warfare in
[1:12:51] rebuilding Eden that's what this sermon
[1:12:53] series has been about it's all about
[1:12:56] being in in Christ as an overcomer
[1:13:01] overcoming uh spiritual warfare of
[1:13:04] course starts it has to it it does it
[1:13:07] not just has to it does factually start
[1:13:10] with the new
[1:13:11] birth that's where the spirit the
[1:13:14] greatest battle ever fought
[1:13:16] begins it's with the new birth in your
[1:13:19] soul and and so now here's the rub
[1:13:23] because
[1:13:23] while you are born again in your soul
[1:13:27] the reality is that that that at the
[1:13:29] same time that my soul is a new creation
[1:13:32] in Christ I'm still actively living in
[1:13:36] an unconverted flesh yes amen and that's
[1:13:40] why it's a Warfare It's The Inside Man
[1:13:44] fighting daily against the outside man
[1:13:47] in the greatest battle ever fought see
[1:13:51] and so what is the war brother Jason I
[1:13:53] will tell you what I'm fighting for now
[1:13:56] I don't know what you're fighting for
[1:13:59] but I'm here to tell you what I'm
[1:14:00] fighting for and once I tell you maybe
[1:14:02] you'll understand why I'm at nine Parts
[1:14:05] deep into this series and with another
[1:14:07] one in the wings is because to me it's a
[1:14:10] war to bring my whole being subject to
[1:14:14] every word of God I'm striving now to be
[1:14:19] that which will be all natural to me
[1:14:22] over there
[1:14:25] yes there's a theophany of me in another
[1:14:28] realm and that's a word body and I'm
[1:14:30] fighting every day there's another me I
[1:14:34] you have heard from your theophany
[1:14:36] there's another me and I'm fighting
[1:14:38] every day trying to let God's word be
[1:14:41] accomplished on Earth as it is in heaven
[1:14:44] be accomplished on Earth as it is in
[1:14:48] heaven I'm trying to get to that image
[1:14:51] that's what the war I'm here to tell
[1:14:52] it's wor worth fighting
[1:14:56] for it's worth fighting for
[1:14:59] friends as I said is your priesthood
[1:15:02] that that is the grounds and the
[1:15:04] authority of your of your kingship
[1:15:05] because your Authority towards men and
[1:15:09] the the the world the the devil and the
[1:15:11] Flesh and sin but you're a priest toward
[1:15:14] God because you're an intercessor and
[1:15:16] your life lives out a spiritual
[1:15:19] sacrifice before God and it is in your
[1:15:22] success as a spiritual sacrifice to God
[1:15:26] that God then gets behind your Authority
[1:15:29] and you have authority over sin the
[1:15:31] World the Flesh and the devil if you're
[1:15:33] not willing to be a sacrificial uh
[1:15:36] priest then you'll never have authority
[1:15:39] and you'll wonder forever why your life
[1:15:42] can't have any Victory and any power and
[1:15:45] Everything You Touch uh gets ruined I'm
[1:15:47] here to tell you there is a real power
[1:15:49] that God wants to bring upon us and have
[1:15:52] us work
[1:15:55] working sir there's no way to do it if
[1:15:58] your priesthood isn't in
[1:16:00] place with the help of the Holy
[1:16:03] Ghost we become willing to die to self
[1:16:07] daily
[1:16:09] amen with the help of the Holy
[1:16:12] Ghost I willingly lay
[1:16:15] aside the weights and sins that pull at
[1:16:20] the sinful nature of My unconverted
[1:16:22] Flesh
[1:16:27] if I don't do that if I give my eyes and
[1:16:30] ears to the things of the world then I'm
[1:16:35] not laying aside the things that beset
[1:16:40] me and if you choose to live that way
[1:16:42] don't be amazed that you get
[1:16:48] beset and there's nothing I can do for
[1:16:51] you all I have all I see friends you're
[1:16:56] so nice to me all these years and the
[1:16:59] respect that you've given me I was I I I
[1:17:02] was just there U among the uh black
[1:17:06] churches there all the many of the
[1:17:07] Colombia churches had gathered around
[1:17:09] and brother Benny Perry's meetings it
[1:17:11] was so good to renew old acquaintance
[1:17:13] and my goodness the hospitality was just
[1:17:16] at another level and I just was I came
[1:17:19] to the pull pit on Sunday to express my
[1:17:21] gratitude you know the way I would
[1:17:23] express my gratitude to you today and
[1:17:26] say I I wish I could give you something
[1:17:29] back for all the years of loyalty I wish
[1:17:32] I could repay you uh for all of your
[1:17:36] kindness and your Allegiance and how
[1:17:38] many how you pray for me and and and you
[1:17:41] love me and you love my family and and
[1:17:44] and and and I think what what's the
[1:17:46] greatest thing the greatest thing that I
[1:17:50] that if I could give you anything that's
[1:17:52] the the the greatest possible thing
[1:17:54] would be to give you eternal life
[1:17:56] however that's not mine to
[1:17:59] give I'm not in a position to give you
[1:18:02] eternal life but what I can do is give
[1:18:05] you that which will lead you there I can
[1:18:09] give you the word and that word if
[1:18:11] you'll believe it and follow the word
[1:18:14] you'll get
[1:18:15] home
[1:18:19] see so we must make these decisions to
[1:18:22] lay us aside the things don't you know
[1:18:26] don't don't wait to lay aside a sinful
[1:18:30] thing lay aside the thing that leads you
[1:18:33] to the sinful thing don't wait for the
[1:18:36] carnality lay aside the thing that bait
[1:18:39] you toward
[1:18:40] it
[1:18:44] see when you when you can look into the
[1:18:46] mirror of God's word and I'm watching my
[1:18:49] time I'm just going to try to get so far
[1:18:51] today friends when you can look into the
[1:18:54] mirror of God's word and and this is the
[1:18:56] mirror of God's word it shows a man or
[1:19:00] woman what they really
[1:19:02] are whenever that happens to you and you
[1:19:04] come here and the Lord reveals to you
[1:19:06] who you really are under the anointing
[1:19:08] right now cuz see right now I've already
[1:19:10] cast out a bunch of devils I've been
[1:19:13] standing here for the last 40 minutes
[1:19:14] that's what I've been doing brother M
[1:19:16] said the the preaching of the Gospel
[1:19:19] cast out Devils cast out demons another
[1:19:23] place he said the preaching of the
[1:19:24] Gospel drives back spirits of unbelief
[1:19:28] so I've shoved them out the door and
[1:19:29] squeezed them out the windows now you
[1:19:31] can make an honest
[1:19:33] decision but whatever the Lord has
[1:19:36] showing you right now while you're
[1:19:37] sitting here in his presence don't go
[1:19:40] out that door and forget the person that
[1:19:44] the word showed you you really were with
[1:19:46] all of the holes and your and your
[1:19:48] deficits and the Holy Spirit is showing
[1:19:51] you what you need to fix and you go
[1:19:52] right out out the door and forget that
[1:19:53] you even needed to fix them you forget
[1:19:56] that you even had them to fix see so
[1:20:00] because when you can look in the mirror
[1:20:01] of God's word and you can see that you
[1:20:03] are allowing ungod ungodly carnality see
[1:20:07] and and yet brother Brandon would say
[1:20:10] remember Sister say I've got the Holy
[1:20:12] Ghost he said just think about what
[1:20:14] you're saying remember Sister he's a
[1:20:16] holy
[1:20:18] spirit he's not a filthy spirit and
[1:20:21] again I I'm not talking about stumbling
[1:20:23] at it which we always do uh you know but
[1:20:26] I'm talking about when you when you can
[1:20:29] in real honesty and you can see that you
[1:20:33] are allowing that thing to live on your
[1:20:37] surface come on friends that's why we
[1:20:39] have the house of God it's a house of
[1:20:42] judgment it's a house of correction I'm
[1:20:45] here to condemn it I'm trying to wash
[1:20:47] you clean by the washing of the water of
[1:20:50] the word don't resist it don't resist at
[1:20:53] whatever you do don't feel hard at me
[1:20:55] don't feel bad at me just say Lord help
[1:21:02] me
[1:21:05] so you might want to sometimes I
[1:21:09] wonder and again I and I've grappled
[1:21:12] with this
[1:21:13] question I'm sure it's some of both
[1:21:16] there's no way it wouldn't
[1:21:17] be but I'm in preaching this series I've
[1:21:21] said repeatedly I'm preaching to
[1:21:23] Believers Now by that I mean people who
[1:21:25] are born
[1:21:26] again and I don't just mean people who
[1:21:28] say they are I really believe I'm
[1:21:30] preaching to Born Again
[1:21:33] people but but I'm here to tell you that
[1:21:38] the evidence of the new birth the best
[1:21:41] evidence that the angel of the Lord told
[1:21:46] the signifying Angel to tell you and me
[1:21:50] was that the ability from your heart to
[1:21:52] say Amen to every word is the evidence
[1:21:56] of the new birth you understand so I I
[1:22:01] get that we stumble I get that we make
[1:22:04] mistakes but I just want to say to you
[1:22:06] friends if you find yourself like Jesus
[1:22:09] said that in your heart the desire of
[1:22:11] the world is still there and you're only
[1:22:14] obeying it because you don't want to go
[1:22:16] to hell or you don't want to miss the
[1:22:18] Rapture or you know you should do right
[1:22:20] but that desire I'm not talking about
[1:22:23] your flesh gets tempted with I'm talking
[1:22:24] about your desire to be clean before God
[1:22:27] or not and you don't you you're just
[1:22:29] grinding it out by your own uh willpower
[1:22:32] listen friends that's what we have an
[1:22:33] altar for and this altar is today and I
[1:22:36] don't care if you've been in a message
[1:22:38] church or even this message church since
[1:22:40] its Inception if the love of the world
[1:22:44] is still in your heart it's because
[1:22:46] you've never come to a full new birth
[1:22:48] and you've never you've never repented
[1:22:51] sufficiently for God to see that it was
[1:22:53] sufficient to give you the sealing
[1:22:56] experience of the Holy Ghost that's the
[1:22:58] plain teaching of the word of God you
[1:23:01] need a deeper revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:23:03] to you personally
[1:23:06] see and so because you you just might be
[1:23:10] missing a level you think you have but
[1:23:13] don't see because the true revelation of
[1:23:17] Jesus Christ to you personally that is
[1:23:19] the new birth and it and it does bring
[1:23:23] your will subject to every word it does
[1:23:26] it's not it's I fail to let it bring it
[1:23:31] to my flesh but he has not failed to
[1:23:35] bring it to my heart you understand see
[1:23:39] so according to the Bible only those say
[1:23:42] why did you make the statement you fear
[1:23:44] for people like that who maybe sit in
[1:23:46] message churches but they never really
[1:23:49] uh you never see the carnality leave you
[1:23:51] never you never really see the decision
[1:23:53] made and you see them accepting a
[1:23:56] watered down you say I fear I've said I
[1:23:58] fear for you come Rapture time so why
[1:24:01] why would you say that brother Jason
[1:24:03] because according to the Bible do you
[1:24:04] believe the Bible according to the Bible
[1:24:08] only those who have the full experience
[1:24:11] of the new birth only those who are
[1:24:13] sealed into the kingdom by God by the
[1:24:17] Holy Ghost are the only ones going in
[1:24:20] the
[1:24:21] rapture they're the only ones because
[1:24:25] they're part of the first resurrection
[1:24:27] they've passed from Death to life and
[1:24:29] can never come into the judgment and
[1:24:31] they achieve this by a heartfelt
[1:24:34] willingness to say Amen to every word of
[1:24:39] God without exception which is what true
[1:24:43] and full repentance is this is the level
[1:24:47] of repentance that entitles you to the
[1:24:51] token see the the only requirement was
[1:24:53] to repent that was it what shall we do
[1:24:58] they said to Peter repent see because
[1:25:02] because repentance is your willingness
[1:25:04] to completely die say well I did repent
[1:25:07] but I still didn't get it I still have
[1:25:09] these dis that's because you didn't
[1:25:10] repent far enough if you leave even one
[1:25:14] grain in your heart the devil will just
[1:25:16] start back there and rebuild his whole
[1:25:17] Kingdom again you've got to come to the
[1:25:20] point where you have met Christ and you
[1:25:21] don't want to be you anymore you want to
[1:25:23] be him and the every every fiber of your
[1:25:27] being you're not perfect you got sins
[1:25:29] you've got weaknesses yes yes yes yes
[1:25:31] get that I understand that the Lord
[1:25:34] understands that don't worry he'll take
[1:25:36] you on from repentance to baptism and
[1:25:38] he'll take you from baptism to church
[1:25:39] and he'll start teaching you the word
[1:25:41] and cleaning you up and you'll get
[1:25:43] strength but you first got to
[1:25:46] repent
[1:25:48] fully
[1:25:49] see you'll never do that doubting the
[1:25:52] word are trying to water it down you'll
[1:25:53] go your whole life you'll come to this
[1:25:55] church and the Rapture will come and
[1:25:57] you'll still be at this
[1:26:02] church so that's that's the level that
[1:26:05] entitles you to the token and of course
[1:26:08] need I remind you the token is your
[1:26:10] ticket to the old
[1:26:12] chip um your token is what allows you to
[1:26:16] get on the glorybound train because
[1:26:18] you've heard the voice of the
[1:26:20] resurrection and so I I I don't remember
[1:26:25] if I've made this statement in the
[1:26:26] series prior but if I have the holy
[1:26:29] spirit's prompting me to say it again
[1:26:31] there's a great distance between knowing
[1:26:34] him and knowing about
[1:26:39] him amen there's a great distance
[1:26:43] between knowing him and knowing about
[1:26:45] him we read uh it was remarkable to us
[1:26:48] all I two or three parts ago I forget
[1:26:51] part 5 six somewhere around in there
[1:26:53] best I can remember where he was saying
[1:26:57] remember Lot's
[1:26:59] wife and that was a prophecy for us at
[1:27:01] the end time remember Lot's
[1:27:04] wife don't get tricked don't get fooled
[1:27:08] yes she got out but her heart was still
[1:27:11] back there remember Lot's wife see to
[1:27:14] know him because because to know him is
[1:27:18] life you understand to know him is to
[1:27:21] know him in the power of his
[1:27:23] resurrection to know him is to know him
[1:27:26] in the fellowship of his sufferings to
[1:27:28] know him is being made conformable unto
[1:27:31] his death Paul said that I may know
[1:27:35] him a big difference from that to
[1:27:37] knowing just knowing about him that's
[1:27:41] part of the suffering that's part of the
[1:27:42] priesthood when you're willing to die
[1:27:45] with Christ and you're willing to become
[1:27:47] an outcast from the world you are or you
[1:27:51] aren't how many today are willing to say
[1:27:54] I will take the way with the Lord's
[1:27:57] despise few and I will be an outcast
[1:28:00] because I'm looking for another
[1:28:04] world this is exactly why see the you
[1:28:09] you you no longer want to be like Lot's
[1:28:11] wife this is exactly why God sends forth
[1:28:14] his faithful ministers this is why they
[1:28:17] call for surrender service after service
[1:28:19] they constantly cry it's why I
[1:28:21] constantly cry for sincerity and
[1:28:24] dedication before the Lord see because I
[1:28:27] know that the modern influences of Sodom
[1:28:30] are
[1:28:31] constant I know they're constantly upon
[1:28:34] you and they press upon us and and even
[1:28:37] Believers and even his true family are
[1:28:39] not exempt from that see they press upon
[1:28:43] us and and so his true ministers can
[1:28:46] never and may I say to my own team here
[1:28:49] we can never Brothers we can never and
[1:28:52] we must never stop compelling greater
[1:28:56] sincerity and greater dedication because
[1:28:59] the assault from the Sodom uh uh age
[1:29:02] affects our minds it affects your
[1:29:04] children it affects children who maybe
[1:29:06] aren't even born yet and so for as long
[1:29:09] as we stand in this pull pit we've got
[1:29:11] to hold up the Blood Stained banner and
[1:29:13] declare what God has said and that the
[1:29:17] family of God are made in the image of
[1:29:21] God amen amen they're made in the image
[1:29:25] of
[1:29:28] God I've been about exactly one hour I
[1:29:30] want another 15 minutes you good I going
[1:29:33] to take it regardless but I just want to
[1:29:36] ask
[1:29:39] you so let's have my uh
[1:29:43] PowerPoint
[1:29:49] guys rebuilding Eden this is part
[1:29:53] nine almost
[1:29:56] home brother brandham
[1:29:59] says um let's see whoops I turned it off
[1:30:02] I don't have anything on that screen so
[1:30:03] if we can figure that out so I can read
[1:30:05] it from
[1:30:06] there what is it oh okay never mind then
[1:30:09] I'll just I'll just turn here all right
[1:30:11] so brother brandham says here in the
[1:30:14] adoption
[1:30:16] series but the Believers the Caleb and
[1:30:20] Joshua outfit want to be a part of
[1:30:24] that amen praise the Lord that was going
[1:30:27] on to the promise they moved on over
[1:30:30] into the land and took the land and
[1:30:34] settled down in the land as a
[1:30:37] possession and we never stop at
[1:30:40] justification sanctification let's go on
[1:30:44] to the baptism of the Holy Spirit let's
[1:30:46] not stop at Believing on the Lord Jesus
[1:30:49] being baptized let's not stop stop
[1:30:52] because he cleaned us up from a life of
[1:30:54] sin but now we press on into a
[1:30:58] possession did I uh uh into a position
[1:31:02] to a promise there it is into a position
[1:31:06] to a promise of the baptism of the Holy
[1:31:09] Ghost now so so I I want you to notice
[1:31:13] this so so what a prophet is trying to
[1:31:15] get you to understand here's one of the
[1:31:17] points is that when you think of the
[1:31:21] term
[1:31:23] position we press on into a position to
[1:31:27] a promise of the baptism of the Holy
[1:31:30] Ghost so the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:31:34] equals
[1:31:36] position
[1:31:38] easy that's not Einstein formula that's
[1:31:41] just baptism of the Holy Ghost equals
[1:31:45] position see so the
[1:31:48] position uh the position is what gives
[1:31:52] me you know it's it's what gives me The
[1:31:55] High Ground in this
[1:31:57] war that's what Caleb when he took the
[1:32:00] mountain then he had The High Ground
[1:32:03] then when somebody comes to try to take
[1:32:05] it from him he's got The High Ground I'm
[1:32:07] here to tell you that your baptism and
[1:32:09] the Holy Spirit yes it's a greatest
[1:32:12] battle it's the greatest battle ever
[1:32:14] fought but you're holding The High
[1:32:18] Ground this is this is the position that
[1:32:21] makes me a high priest and if I'm a high
[1:32:24] priest then I have Authority for my
[1:32:27] kingship see this is the position that
[1:32:31] gives me Rank and Authority in the chain
[1:32:33] of command this is what enables me to
[1:32:35] have power over the devil and the world
[1:32:38] and sin in the flesh because I've come
[1:32:40] into a position in Christ
[1:32:44] Jesus so he goes
[1:32:47] on and oops how how how do we get there
[1:32:50] uh
[1:32:52] I must not have put that last part in
[1:32:54] let me just read it before we switch so
[1:32:56] he says so Ephesus here sets us like
[1:33:00] Joshua
[1:33:01] positionally you notice Joshua after
[1:33:04] crossing over the land and taking the
[1:33:08] land then he divided the land Ephraim
[1:33:12] here Manasseh here and this one here and
[1:33:14] Gad here Benjamin here see divided lands
[1:33:16] he's got
[1:33:17] Authority because he's got a position
[1:33:20] cuz he crossed over you see so we teach
[1:33:25] that moving on to the promised land of
[1:33:27] the Holy Ghost is the full birth it's
[1:33:30] the seed coming to life in manifestation
[1:33:34] that's what the new birth is brother
[1:33:37] brandom I'm going to give you from 1965
[1:33:40] who is this mzc to settle this issue of
[1:33:43] what is when we say the baptism of the
[1:33:46] Holy Ghost please tell me that in planer
[1:33:49] language that's a broad term what does
[1:33:51] that even mean all right thank God we've
[1:33:54] got a prophet and then when you become
[1:33:57] subject to that Spirit it throws your
[1:34:01] whole being subject to that spirit and
[1:34:05] that Spirit now this is the new birth
[1:34:07] and that spirit is nothing in the world
[1:34:10] but this seed word made manifest or
[1:34:13] quickened Hallelujah Made Alive and when
[1:34:16] the Bible said don't do this that body
[1:34:18] quickly turns to it there is no question
[1:34:22] and what is it it's the earnest of the
[1:34:24] Resurrection this body will be raised up
[1:34:27] again because it's already started what
[1:34:30] a beautiful way to say it see it was
[1:34:33] once subject to sin and mire and
[1:34:36] Corruption but now it's got the earnest
[1:34:38] it's turned Heavenly now that's the
[1:34:40] earnest that you're going in the Rapture
[1:34:43] it's the earnest so it's a gene seed of
[1:34:46] God that has been quickened by a
[1:34:48] revelation of the word and it's a a new
[1:34:51] creation inside you the old nature of
[1:34:54] the spirit is annihilated and you've got
[1:34:56] a war on your hands cuz now there's an
[1:34:58] inner man saying to the outer man Shape
[1:35:01] Up and the outer man says but I still I
[1:35:05] don't want to shape up but the inner man
[1:35:06] says greater am I than you because
[1:35:10] greater is he that is in you than he
[1:35:12] that is in the world greater is he that
[1:35:14] is in my soul than he that is in my
[1:35:17] flesh all I got to do say well how do I
[1:35:20] make that army WR strong he feeds on the
[1:35:23] word lay aside the things that weaken
[1:35:28] him am
[1:35:30] see lay aside the things that weaken
[1:35:35] him so this is why I keep saying that
[1:35:38] the lon share of this series is preached
[1:35:42] more to believers who are already born
[1:35:45] again see uh but but listen let me just
[1:35:48] say it like
[1:35:49] this even if that's
[1:35:52] true and even if you've crossed into the
[1:35:55] promised land they still had to fight
[1:35:59] Caleb still had to take his
[1:36:02] Mountain you understand the Holy Ghost
[1:36:04] New Birth gives you the rights to it but
[1:36:06] you still got to go get it you still got
[1:36:10] to lay aside the weights and sins you
[1:36:12] still got to add to Faith and virtue
[1:36:14] knowledge you still got to bring every
[1:36:16] thought subject to the spirit you still
[1:36:18] got to cast down vain imaginations Paul
[1:36:20] said to Born Again people who had been
[1:36:22] born again for 30 years I would that
[1:36:25] you'd be filled with all the fullness of
[1:36:28] God see so they still to be born again
[1:36:34] the Bible says to fight the fight of
[1:36:36] Faith give me uh brother Mark give me
[1:36:39] first Timothy 6 I want to read this
[1:36:41] before I close and we'll grab one more
[1:36:44] scripture and then we're then we're done
[1:36:45] for
[1:36:46] today I want to make this statement
[1:36:48] we're going to 1 Timothy
[1:36:50] 6 because we're about to make a
[1:36:52] statement where the Bible tells you to
[1:36:54] fight you born again people fight the
[1:36:57] fight of Faith 1 Timothy 6 verse 11 and
[1:37:01] 12 but thou oh man of
[1:37:04] God flee these things and follow after
[1:37:11] righteousness
[1:37:12] godliness Faith love patience and
[1:37:18] meekness if they can't get it it's all
[1:37:20] right I'm quoting it to you so now
[1:37:22] here's the first thing he doesn't open
[1:37:25] up with but thou sinful
[1:37:28] man he opens up with but thou oh man of
[1:37:33] God well I'm already born again well oh
[1:37:36] good now start
[1:37:38] fleeing man of God start fleeing these
[1:37:41] things and follow after righteousness
[1:37:43] God and his faith love patience meekness
[1:37:46] why would Paul need to say that see
[1:37:49] because you've crossed over but you
[1:37:51] still got to take a mountain and then
[1:37:53] you got to hold that
[1:37:55] mountain don't think the devil's just
[1:37:57] going to walk away verse 12 fight the
[1:38:01] good fight of Faith lay hold man of God
[1:38:05] lay hold on eternal life I thought I
[1:38:07] already had it we're now moved to
[1:38:09] another section you got to fight the
[1:38:12] fight of Faith man of God daughter of
[1:38:14] God you're born again of the spirit of
[1:38:16] God now get
[1:38:18] Fighting fight the good fight of faith
[1:38:21] lay hold on eternal life wherein to Thou
[1:38:24] Art also called and H has professed a
[1:38:27] good profession before many witnesses
[1:38:29] pressing toward the Mark is that's all
[1:38:32] brother Mark pressing uh pressing toward
[1:38:35] the Mark I was going to read Philippians
[1:38:37] 3:12 we've read it plenty of times
[1:38:39] pressing toward the Mark is not said to
[1:38:47] unbelievers pressing toward the Mark is
