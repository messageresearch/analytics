[4:12] do
[4:21] hebrews chapter 11. if you have your
[4:23] bible we'll turn there
[4:25] and just read a portion of scripture
[4:33] we spoke last two sundays ago on the
[4:36] scandal of particularity
[4:37] we'd like to discontinue that here this
[4:39] morning
[4:40] now faith is the substance of things
[4:42] hoped for the
[4:44] evidence of things not seen for by it
[4:47] the elders obtained a good report
[4:49] through faith we understand that the
[4:51] worlds were framed by the word of god
[4:53] so that the things which are seen were
[4:55] not made of things which do appear
[4:58] by faith abel offered unto god a more
[5:01] excellent sacrifice than
[5:02] cain by which he obtained witness that
[5:05] he was righteous
[5:06] god testifying of his gifts and by it he
[5:09] being dead
[5:10] yet speaketh by faith enoch was
[5:13] translated that he should not see death
[5:16] and was not found because god had
[5:19] translated him for before his
[5:21] translation
[5:22] he had this testimony it's a testimony
[5:24] i'd like to have that he pleased god
[5:27] but without faith it is impossible
[5:31] to please him for he that cometh to god
[5:34] must and here's what's important must
[5:37] believe
[5:38] that he is and
[5:42] that he's a rewarder of them that
[5:44] diligently
[5:46] seek him by faith noah and we'll just
[5:49] move on past
[5:50] that to verse 8 by faith abraham when he
[5:53] was called to go out into a place which
[5:55] he should after receive for an
[5:56] inheritance
[5:57] obeyed and he went out not knowing
[6:01] whether he went
[6:02] by faith he sojourned in the land of
[6:05] promise
[6:06] as in a strange country dwelling in
[6:09] tabernacles
[6:10] means tense with isaac and jacob
[6:13] the heirs with him of the same promise
[6:17] for he looked for a city which had
[6:20] foundations
[6:21] whose builder and maker is god you can
[6:25] be seated this morning
[6:27] we're going to detour just a little bit
[6:29] into the subject
[6:31] of faith because i believe that we
[6:33] couldn't cover
[6:34] abraham isaac and jacob without covering
[6:37] that topic
[6:38] and we we've seen a lot two weekends ago
[6:44] um how important it was let me just pull
[6:46] up my
[6:48] my notes here we spoke on the two
[6:51] threads and i'll just
[6:52] i'll just cover skim over some of this
[6:54] of what we spoke on last
[6:56] last time we spoke on this that you'll
[6:59] find throughout the bible this
[7:01] reference to the god of abraham isaac
[7:03] and jacob and we know paul in the new
[7:05] testament
[7:06] just connects the dots for us when he
[7:08] said that
[7:09] if you are christ's then you're
[7:11] abraham's seed
[7:13] and so he connects ireland our line
[7:16] of faith with the line that he started
[7:19] through with redemption through abraham
[7:22] that's why we say that we're children of
[7:24] the promise children of abraham
[7:26] but you'll find that there's these two
[7:28] threads that run throughout
[7:30] all of the old testament and one thread
[7:33] is that god
[7:34] is that the god of the jews the god who
[7:37] the jews
[7:37] claim or proclaim is the god of the
[7:41] universe
[7:42] that's very clear from the bible that
[7:45] the jews aren't disclaiming a god but
[7:47] they're claiming
[7:48] the god the god of gods the king of
[7:51] kings the lord of lords
[7:53] and and we understood that every nation
[7:56] in those days had their own religion
[7:58] they had their own god
[7:59] a lot of the wars as we said that were
[8:01] fought were religious
[8:02] wars or religiously motivated the god of
[8:05] baal the god of asteroid
[8:07] god of moloch and so
[8:10] israel's god was jehovah and he was
[8:14] he was the god of israel and
[8:17] israel claimed that he was a god of all
[8:19] gods but so that's one thread that we
[8:21] see that runs through the book
[8:23] uh through the old testament books all
[8:25] the way through the new testament is
[8:26] that the god
[8:27] that israel claimed that they served was
[8:30] the god of all gods he was the god who
[8:32] created the worlds
[8:34] the other thread that you'll see running
[8:37] through the bible
[8:38] is not israel claiming that their god is
[8:41] the god of
[8:42] gods but the other side or let me
[8:45] rephrase that
[8:46] one thread as we said last sunday one
[8:49] thread is that you'll find that the god
[8:51] of the jews
[8:52] is the god of the whole universe the
[8:55] other thread
[8:55] the other side of that is that the god
[8:58] of the universe
[8:59] is the god of the jews in other words
[9:03] it wasn't just the jews claiming
[9:06] that this is our god but we actually
[9:09] have jehovah himself
[9:11] claiming i am their god so it's really
[9:14] important to understand that it's one
[9:16] thing for
[9:16] a claim to be made it's another thing
[9:19] for god to back up
[9:20] what they said and god identifies
[9:23] himself
[9:24] with this one little bitty tiny group
[9:27] this little family this little small
[9:31] portion of all of the sea of humanity
[9:34] god
[9:35] identifies himself as the god
[9:39] of abraham amen
[9:42] and so it was it was this one little
[9:46] group that that god of universe had
[9:48] became the god who created the stars and
[9:51] the galaxies and the worlds
[9:54] was now calling himself identify him
[9:57] identify himself as the god
[10:00] of abraham and so the god
[10:04] the the let me let me just move through
[10:06] some of this so we don't spend too much
[10:07] time on
[10:08] on uh on review but it's a really
[10:11] incredible
[10:12] it's a really incredible claim as we
[10:15] said
[10:16] and and we see this all of the
[10:19] book of genesis as we said last sunday
[10:22] chapters one through chapter 11 is a
[10:25] very short
[10:26] section but it covers uh a lot of time a
[10:29] great space of time
[10:30] centuries and many peoples and many
[10:33] nations and then you come to chapter 12
[10:36] and god zooms in the picture it's no
[10:39] more covering chapter 12 through chapter
[10:41] 50 is not going to cover a massive
[10:43] amount of time
[10:44] as 1-11 did in a short space of time
[10:47] but it's going to just sort of slow down
[10:49] and history and time is going to come to
[10:52] a slow pace
[10:53] and it's going to cover the lives of
[10:56] just four men
[10:58] abraham isaac and jacob and joseph of
[11:01] course
[11:03] and it zooms in very deliberately as we
[11:06] said
[11:07] it's a very deliberate zooming in
[11:10] from the rest of the world from the rest
[11:13] of
[11:13] all the peoples and all the nations and
[11:16] all the
[11:16] all the rest of the entire uh all the
[11:20] rest of the sea of humanity
[11:22] and it zooms in just to one
[11:25] family it's very important to understand
[11:27] this because
[11:29] in our modern era it is what we
[11:32] we absolutely understand that this is
[11:34] what god did
[11:35] man didn't make this choice god made
[11:38] that choice
[11:39] to select one family one people
[11:42] through whom redemption would come
[11:44] through that one family
[11:46] amen and he would send a jew a jewish
[11:48] man
[11:49] to save the rest of the world it would
[11:52] send
[11:52] a it wasn't a as we said uh the chinese
[11:55] would have a chinese savior and then the
[11:58] americans would have an american savior
[12:00] and the russians would have a russian
[12:01] savior and the jews would have a jewish
[12:03] savior
[12:03] but god chose one man one family
[12:07] and through that one family he would
[12:09] save the rest of the world
[12:11] amen that's why scholars call it the
[12:14] scandal of particularity that god chose
[12:17] one family one man named abraham to
[12:21] begin his program through
[12:24] and that's why it's called a scandal the
[12:26] basis is why would god
[12:28] choose one family just
[12:31] why not everybody why just one little
[12:34] special group of who god
[12:36] says you're my peculiar treasure
[12:41] peculiar treasure amen and god attaches
[12:44] himself in a very
[12:46] intimate special way and nowadays
[12:49] if you were to try to say that god has
[12:53] a special attachment or special love
[12:56] to just one group of people his bride
[13:00] it's a scandal it's
[13:03] it's it just doesn't make sense to the
[13:04] modern world today yet those same
[13:07] the same uh church the same christian
[13:10] scholars
[13:11] who look at the the way that god looked
[13:14] at one family
[13:15] yet those same ones it's it's god loves
[13:17] god there there is no uniqueness there's
[13:19] no election for one group of people yet
[13:22] we understand
[13:23] the god of the old testament became the
[13:25] god of the new testament
[13:26] amen amen and he's not different he's
[13:29] the sa
[13:29] he's a he's he's the same god the people
[13:32] are
[13:33] you most most uh modern christians today
[13:36] are embarrassed of the god of the old
[13:37] testament
[13:38] because we have this as we said we have
[13:41] this
[13:41] uh this humanistic thinking
[13:45] of a god that we can't relate to
[13:48] you know if god is it's the same exact
[13:50] question that's been asked that
[13:52] it's been preached for years and years
[13:54] and years that god is
[13:56] all loving that he loves everybody and
[13:59] god the bible does say for god so love
[14:01] the world
[14:02] but god isn't just love god also hates
[14:06] and in fact the only way he can have
[14:08] love is that he has hatred
[14:11] and the bible speaks of a god who hates
[14:15] and and he's a god of justice he's also
[14:18] a god of mercy he's a god of grace he's
[14:20] a god of love
[14:21] god of forgiveness but he's also a god
[14:23] of judgment amen
[14:25] and it's it's it's a message of and i'll
[14:28] just take a minute just to say this
[14:30] it's a message of love and i know we've
[14:32] covered this in months past but i'll
[14:34] just cover just a portion of this
[14:36] here this morning it's a message of love
[14:39] of love
[14:40] love love that god's all about love and
[14:42] he loves you and he
[14:44] he accepts you and you just love god and
[14:46] all that's required of you is just to
[14:48] love god with all your heart and god
[14:50] loves you and
[14:51] god wants the best for you and god never
[14:54] would do anything to harm or hurt
[14:58] and it's a message of of what they call
[15:01] what has been i should say
[15:03] has been misinterpreted as the good news
[15:07] the gospel the gospel message the good
[15:09] news is that god loves you
[15:11] and the message that we've given to the
[15:14] world
[15:15] the world in masses
[15:19] is that message that one tone
[15:22] one dimensional message of love
[15:27] god loves we'll wait
[15:33] the christian preachers let me just say
[15:35] this that message has been
[15:37] preached and it's rolled over nations
[15:39] it's rolled over the world
[15:41] amen and i'll just ask let's look at our
[15:44] world
[15:45] and ask what has been the result
[15:49] of that sermon amen
[15:52] what is what is it what has it produced
[15:56] in the church the modern church if we
[15:59] had some pictures i'd throw them up on
[16:00] the screen of what the modern church is
[16:02] brother branham seen that modern church
[16:04] and said what a disgrace and then he
[16:07] begins to
[16:08] say after all of the effort after all of
[16:12] the preaching after
[16:13] all of the going from coast to coast c
[16:15] to c
[16:17] and he says and this is the best we can
[16:19] produce
[16:21] half dressed uh rock dancing
[16:24] to the not just half dress that wasn't
[16:26] half dress they were nude completely
[16:28] with just a little gray piece of paper
[16:30] he said covering themselves
[16:32] and he said they were dancing they were
[16:35] marching to the time of rock and roll
[16:37] music
[16:41] so then it's a very simple i think a
[16:42] very fair question has the message that
[16:44] god has loved and god loves everybody
[16:46] been a successful one no
[16:49] it hasn't because any time you
[16:52] you look only at one side of things and
[16:55] not the full picture
[16:57] you're getting a very it's like we've
[16:59] said before carrots are good for you
[17:02] right children yeah carrots are good for
[17:05] you
[17:06] but if you only eat carrots that diet is
[17:09] a bad diet for you
[17:11] so a one-sided gospel
[17:14] produces and it's not just that it's
[17:16] one-sided
[17:17] it's it's one-sided and it's hybridized
[17:20] it's hybrid with men's thinking
[17:24] and so we look at the world and the the
[17:27] message of love what's
[17:28] what has been the results what's been
[17:31] the results in church
[17:32] i'm not talking about the world i'm not
[17:34] talking about the bar room last night
[17:36] i'm talking about your local every day
[17:39] on the corner
[17:40] church evangelical church baptist church
[17:44] no matter what you want to put in that
[17:48] pot
[17:49] what i see is emotion
[17:55] a lot of emotion amen a lot of
[17:57] emotionalism a lot of
[17:59] i'll go a little bit further than that a
[18:01] lot of sensuality
[18:04] because there's a lot of sensuality in
[18:06] modern
[18:07] christianity a lot of it all you got to
[18:10] do is turn on your local
[18:12] local radio station
[18:14] [Music]
[18:16] it's chalked full of sensuality
[18:19] amen and emotion you say brother matt
[18:22] are you preaching against emotion no
[18:24] not at all i'm just surveying what i see
[18:28] of what the what the fruits of
[18:31] only preaching this message of god of
[18:33] love the god who loves
[18:35] has produced it's produced a lot of
[18:38] sensuality
[18:39] it's polluted it's produced a lot of
[18:44] emotion
[18:47] and when we look at in the word and find
[18:50] out what god is really like
[18:52] we find it differs a lot of times
[18:54] greatly
[18:56] from what the church has defined
[19:00] as the gospel as the message
[19:04] and so let me just zero in on my thought
[19:08] here
[19:08] it's led to is what we've said it's led
[19:11] to an emotional
[19:12] understanding of god a connection where
[19:15] we
[19:15] when we say god loves then we connect
[19:18] that with
[19:19] something that we understand because we
[19:21] as human beings
[19:23] we love we love each other we love our
[19:26] children
[19:26] we love our family we love our friends
[19:29] and so when we say
[19:30] god loves we connect the dots
[19:32] immediately but the problem is
[19:33] is that there's a difference between
[19:35] human love and godly love
[19:39] and when you talk about godly love
[19:40] that's where the disconnect happens how
[19:43] could a loving god in other words how
[19:45] could a god who
[19:46] is love like i love allow evil to happen
[19:50] in the world
[19:51] how could a god like that you see
[19:53] because it's a it's a sensual
[19:55] understanding
[19:56] it's a emotional understanding and what
[19:59] it's done when you give someone an
[20:01] emotional understanding of god
[20:03] and that becomes their the way that they
[20:06] relate
[20:07] then it causes people to construct
[20:10] an image of god in their imagination
[20:15] that's not always according to the bible
[20:18] amen
[20:19] and then when bible preaching or
[20:21] teaching is done
[20:22] there's a log jam because there's a
[20:24] disconnect between that image that i've
[20:26] created of who i thought god was
[20:28] and what his word actually says that he
[20:30] is amen
[20:32] amen and so you say brother matt what
[20:33] does that mean that means we we ought to
[20:35] stick to
[20:36] bible teaching and not not imagination
[20:40] and not opinion of what we
[20:42] think or how we relate to god it causes
[20:46] us to construct an image god is so
[20:48] loving he would never cause pain
[20:51] suffering he wouldn't you know god would
[20:53] ever hurt anybody never heard a fly
[20:55] that god loves us so much he's just
[20:58] there to
[20:59] speaking of the imaginational image he's
[21:01] there to protect us
[21:02] from every bit of pain and every bit of
[21:04] suffering and just to provide for all of
[21:06] our needs
[21:08] some of the songs that we sing in this
[21:10] church that's produced and
[21:12] i'm not i sing them not criticizing them
[21:14] at all
[21:15] but some of them if you really break
[21:17] down the substance of the message it's
[21:20] really just that
[21:21] the substance is that god just loves you
[21:24] he wants you
[21:25] he wants you and he he'll he'll keep you
[21:28] he'll protect you
[21:29] you compare that with some of the old
[21:31] hymns and there was
[21:33] that but there was also a gospel message
[21:36] in those lyrics
[21:38] that spoke about the blood that spoke
[21:40] about repentance that spoke about
[21:42] holiness
[21:44] are you all here today
[21:48] and so it's it's a it's in in essence
[21:51] it's really
[21:52] just he's just there to make you happy
[21:54] because everybody everything in the
[21:55] world is just about happiness just
[21:57] everyone's seeking
[21:58] it's the you know you're an alienable
[22:00] right to uh
[22:02] to uh you know seek out peace and and
[22:05] and and and it's all just about to be to
[22:08] to produce happiness in the world
[22:10] and in order to be happy you need two
[22:12] things in life you need health
[22:14] and you need wealth so in short
[22:17] god has became there has became an
[22:20] image just to save you from disease
[22:25] and poverty
[22:28] and you know a lot of people have bought
[22:30] that god a lot of people have accepted
[22:32] and masses and millions will come to an
[22:34] altar to say hey i'm
[22:36] sign me up let me make a commitment
[22:39] right now i'll make a confession i'll
[22:41] put my name on a book right now
[22:43] if that's what god is sign me up
[22:46] right now and this is the concept that
[22:48] of god that is largely in the minds of
[22:50] the world that's why
[22:52] that same concept when you when you
[22:55] when you teach on election that god
[22:57] elected you by foreknowledge
[22:59] that god had one family who would bring
[23:01] redemption through
[23:03] for the rest of the entire world and
[23:04] people say hold on oh that's
[23:06] that's you know that's bias that's not
[23:08] right that's
[23:09] that's that's favoritism that you know
[23:12] that doesn't make any sense
[23:14] god surely the god of all heaven
[23:16] wouldn't do that surely
[23:17] you mean that god has one elected family
[23:20] and one group of people
[23:22] not a group necessarily but a collection
[23:24] of individuals
[23:26] who are identified as his elected seed
[23:29] as his
[23:30] bride and god esteems them at a certain
[23:33] place like a man would esteem a wife i
[23:36] don't know about that preacher
[23:39] i wouldn't i don't know you know i i
[23:41] think that sounds a little bit
[23:43] it sounds a little bit um you know bias
[23:47] if god doesn't keep suffering away you
[23:49] know and and that's the problem is that
[23:52] the bible picture of god is not
[23:55] a god a loving god who loves everybody
[23:57] regardless of who they
[23:58] are or what they do
[24:02] and so whenever something happens in
[24:04] life that
[24:06] that contradicts that image you know you
[24:10] know why it's so
[24:11] wrong to have an image because
[24:14] what is an idol an idol is just an image
[24:18] and so people have literally made god an
[24:22] idol an object of worship
[24:25] but it's a god it's a they're worshiping
[24:27] a god of their imagination
[24:28] all the while thinking they're a
[24:30] christian and they believe and they're a
[24:31] believer
[24:34] when really their entire their entire
[24:37] uh attachment to god you take and i'll
[24:40] just give this one example you take the
[24:41] a man um uh charles templeton
[24:46] was and we've we've said this before
[24:47] billy graham's best friend grew up with
[24:49] him preached with him in tent meetings
[24:52] for years they preached tent revivals
[24:54] together and he was a
[24:56] according to billy graham a much more
[24:58] eloquent speaker than he was
[25:00] powerful gifted man of god
[25:03] and and if you if you study that charles
[25:06] templeton's life
[25:07] he goes billy and him with uh some
[25:10] friends
[25:11] went into a theater that was playing a a
[25:14] documentary what was taking place in
[25:16] germany
[25:17] and and it was the what we know as the
[25:18] holocaust
[25:21] and billy graham says he says charles
[25:23] walked in that
[25:24] theater a a bible preaching
[25:29] gospel singing preacher
[25:32] and he walked out of that theater an
[25:34] atheist
[25:38] and he turned his back on billy turned
[25:40] his back on god
[25:41] and you say what happened how could
[25:45] how could you know how could a loving
[25:48] god how could he he couldn't reconcile
[25:50] this
[25:51] image of who he had imagined god
[25:54] was he couldn't reconcile it with the
[25:57] images
[25:59] that was coming up on the screen and his
[26:02] as paul said his faith was shipwrecked
[26:06] amen and you say what happened to men
[26:09] like it's because they
[26:11] began they started out with a
[26:13] understanding
[26:14] a wrong understanding of you a wrong
[26:17] view of god and oftentimes as we said
[26:22] we need the the real image because god
[26:24] has a real image and it's not in our
[26:26] imagination it's right in his word
[26:28] amen amen because the
[26:31] the bible is the interpretation of who
[26:33] god is not what i
[26:34] say or what you say or what i what i uh
[26:37] imagine
[26:39] god is who god really is as we said
[26:42] that's what the bible calls idolatry
[26:44] because an idol is an idea
[26:46] of god that you can make yourself
[26:48] whether you make it of wood or stone or
[26:50] just in your mind
[26:52] that's the kind of god i like that's the
[26:54] kind of god i would serve
[26:55] but who is really god there's some facts
[26:57] some amazing facts
[26:58] and i'll just we'll just close here in
[27:00] just a minute
[27:02] out of 35 000 verses
[27:06] that are in the bible less than 30
[27:09] talk about love
[27:14] that's under 0.1 percent
[27:20] there are whole books in the bible
[27:23] but the majority of the books the
[27:26] majority of a lot of those books never
[27:28] mention the love of god
[27:29] so you just brother matt very simple
[27:31] question if the bible didn't doesn't
[27:33] emphasize it is it not there no it's
[27:35] absolutely there
[27:36] but when it becomes the key and figure
[27:39] and sinner post and typos
[27:41] and they major on it why are we majoring
[27:43] on something that's not the
[27:45] it's not the overall image or the
[27:47] message of
[27:48] the bible how many times do you think
[27:52] that the love of god is mentioned in the
[27:54] book of acts
[27:56] now before you answer that let me give
[27:58] you some facts
[27:59] acts some facts about acts acts has 28
[28:03] chapters
[28:06] right average book in the bible has they
[28:08] say 18.
[28:09] acts chronicles the spread of the early
[28:11] church
[28:12] over 30 years from the final words of
[28:16] jesus and his ascension into heaven all
[28:18] the way through a pot the apostle paul's
[28:21] uh imprisonment near the end of his life
[28:23] that's what
[28:24] the book of acts covers it has 13
[28:27] different times it presents the gospel
[28:30] message
[28:31] 13 times to different people different
[28:35] different kinds of people different
[28:37] places different crowds
[28:38] jews gentiles regular people to
[28:41] high ranking government people 13
[28:43] different times
[28:44] it presents the gospel so now you know
[28:46] that how many times is the word love
[28:49] mentioned in acts the answer
[28:53] zero
[28:57] zero do a word search in your bible
[29:00] software
[29:02] it's okay because when i first heard
[29:04] that i thought that's impossible there's
[29:05] no way
[29:06] no it's not possible
[29:09] so the bible as we as we
[29:12] said the only time believers talk about
[29:15] the love of god
[29:16] really when you read about them speaking
[29:18] they're speaking to other believers
[29:21] in other words the message that they
[29:23] give to the world is not just a god who
[29:26] loves and he just accepts you and just
[29:27] come as you are
[29:29] that's not the message that produces
[29:31] conviction
[29:32] but the gospel message was repent
[29:36] and be baptized every one of you in the
[29:38] name of the lord jesus christ
[29:40] and the sermon that paul that peter
[29:42] preaches the bible says they were
[29:44] pricked in their hearts
[29:46] they were stabbed in the heart and said
[29:47] men and brethren what must we do
[29:50] to be saved so it produces
[29:53] a a conviction
[29:56] and i believe that's the way the lord
[29:59] is wanting to speak today i i we read
[30:02] the very beginning there
[30:03] hebrews chapter 11. listen to what
[30:04] brother branham says i'm just going to
[30:06] read this and then we'll close i don't
[30:08] really have time
[30:10] to cover this because we we look at
[30:14] three men
[30:14] let me just make this last comment then
[30:16] i'll have you stand
[30:19] i would run into the time of the song
[30:21] leader but i'm the song leader today so
[30:23] we'll stop on time just kidding
[30:26] but you look at these three men abraham
[30:28] isaac and jacob and you say
[30:30] why why would god choose this family
[30:32] these men
[30:33] now you can ask a very fair question you
[30:35] could say why these men
[30:37] because you know what's amazing about
[30:39] abraham isaac and jacob
[30:41] you see three men and really in the
[30:44] stories that genesis tells us there's
[30:46] not really a i mean
[30:47] you have the abra the miracle of sarah
[30:50] but
[30:51] and abraham but it's not uh it's not the
[30:54] stories of
[30:54] of mighty men with miraculous works in
[30:57] their life
[30:59] right i could read you the stories about
[31:02] samson and man it's just a story filled
[31:04] with supernatural strength
[31:06] read the story about daniel and his
[31:08] entire life and the miraculous the
[31:10] miracles that take place in some of
[31:12] these men's life
[31:13] but the family that god chooses and the
[31:16] three characters that he's focuses it on
[31:18] it's really not a big powerful
[31:20] miraculous life
[31:22] in fact it's a life of a lot of mistakes
[31:28] all three men were liars
[31:32] that's how they were connected all three
[31:34] of them lied abraham about his wife
[31:36] isaac jacob what a shyster as brother
[31:39] adam calls him
[31:40] you wouldn't want jacob as your as a as
[31:42] a family member let me just put it that
[31:45] way
[31:46] you better be watching your wallet
[31:52] you see these three men you could ask
[31:54] why would god
[31:55] choose this these men
[31:59] these guys abraham isaac jacob
[32:03] men men full of mistakes
[32:06] and trouble not necessarily what we'd
[32:09] even call
[32:10] good men amen but you know you say
[32:12] brother matt then what
[32:14] was it about these three men that
[32:16] separated them that something about them
[32:18] that god seen i'm going to give you one
[32:19] word
[32:20] because it's what they possessed and it
[32:22] wasn't the characteristic of
[32:24] good habits or good behavior it was
[32:27] faith
[32:28] amen because in these three men
[32:31] they all had faith
[32:34] amen they weren't good men but they were
[32:37] believing men
[32:38] and god can actually do a lot more
[32:40] through a believing man than he could
[32:42] through a good man who doesn't believe
[32:45] because there's a lot of good people in
[32:46] the world who don't believe that's right
[32:48] so god says i'm going to choose i'm
[32:50] going to use
[32:51] not necessarily what you might would
[32:54] esteem as a good person
[32:56] but a person who has a quality called
[32:58] faith
[32:59] amen brother madam says what is faith
[33:01] faith is something that's revealed to
[33:03] you
[33:04] that is not yet but you believe it that
[33:06] it will be
[33:07] faith is a revelation of the will of god
[33:10] by revelation we're out of time let's
[33:12] all stand to our feet
[33:15] thank you lord jesus for this morning
[33:18] sunday's teaching lord
[33:19] we just ask lord for your words that
[33:22] were spoken
[33:23] lord may it just sow a seed down inside
[33:25] of our soul today
[33:27] may we feed upon it lord in this service
[33:29] today we ask for you to take control
[33:31] complete control lord may you have the
[33:33] preeminence in all things
[33:35] in jesus name amen amen
[33:52] [Music]
[33:59] you
