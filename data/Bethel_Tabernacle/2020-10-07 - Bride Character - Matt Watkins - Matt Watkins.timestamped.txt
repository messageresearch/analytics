[30:27] amen uh the lord put it upon my heart
[30:30] maybe honest give this real brief here
[30:33] before we
[30:34] uh turn to the word before we read the
[30:35] scripture um i guess it was
[30:38] brothers am i on here i don't hear
[30:40] myself at all
[30:45] yeah the monitors yeah we might need to
[30:48] go to uh
[30:49] the monitor yeah they're on so just go
[30:51] to the auxiliary for them
[30:53] on the this mike's channel and bump them
[30:56] up for me if you could
[30:57] amen about a month ago i guess it was
[30:59] september 1st
[31:00] um yeah about the first of september so
[31:04] almost a month ago now
[31:05] i was fellowshipping with a brother and
[31:08] we were just discussing certain things
[31:09] and brother matthew came up in the
[31:11] conversation
[31:12] and i expressed to him and it was i was
[31:14] brother travis who i was talking to
[31:16] and uh and i told him i said you know i
[31:19] said uh
[31:20] the lord put it upon my heart i was
[31:21] sitting in church sometime in the
[31:23] beginning of august
[31:24] and you know lord just drops a thought
[31:26] upon your heart sometimes and
[31:28] i just felt just right there in church
[31:30] the lord i've seen
[31:31] matthew just the back of his head and
[31:33] just the lord put a thought on my heart
[31:35] lord's got a call in in matthew's life
[31:37] to lead worship
[31:39] and so i had that thought in my heart
[31:41] and i thought well
[31:42] you know the thought came in my mind and
[31:44] i just said okay lord you know well
[31:45] maybe in your time in your season i'm
[31:47] sure
[31:48] you know you do all things well in your
[31:50] time we don't rush god we do everything
[31:52] according to his time
[31:54] and uh and i just expressed that to
[31:56] brother travis
[31:57] and uh brother travis his eyes lit up
[32:00] and he said
[32:01] who told you that and i said well i said
[32:04] no one know what he said he's
[32:06] brother you've never talked to matthew
[32:07] about that i said no never
[32:09] i said i didn't even know you know my
[32:11] mind if he'd be that'd be something he'd
[32:12] want to do i felt the lord told me in my
[32:14] heart
[32:15] but i sort of kept it to myself and uh
[32:18] and he said
[32:19] well then it has to be god you haven't
[32:20] talked to nobody said no he said then it
[32:22] has to be god
[32:23] i said why he said because matthew's
[32:25] told me privately
[32:27] that uh that the lord told him that but
[32:30] that he was
[32:30] waiting on the lord waiting for someone
[32:32] to ask him before he would do it
[32:34] and he said so it just has to be god i
[32:36] said well i said then it's just
[32:38] the holy spirit then we'll just wait for
[32:39] the lord so i just kept it in my heart
[32:42] uh and then coming back from arizona i
[32:44] was thinking about it
[32:45] some more and then this afternoon i had
[32:48] actually been scheduled to lead worship
[32:49] tonight on the calendar
[32:51] and then realized i had to preach so at
[32:53] about 11 o'clock today i realized i
[32:55] gotta get a song leader
[32:56] and i was gonna call brother brad maybe
[32:58] brother tony get someone to fill in for
[33:00] me
[33:01] and then i just at about three o'clock i
[33:04] came into the church was sitting right
[33:05] here
[33:06] and just prayed and waited on the lord
[33:07] and just studied got out my laptop said
[33:10] lord i'm just gonna turn to your word
[33:11] and and right then the thought came
[33:13] again you gotta have a worship leader
[33:14] tonight or you're gonna be in trouble so
[33:17] right when i thought that i picked up
[33:18] the phone
[33:19] and started starting to pick up the
[33:21] phone and the holy spirit just stopped
[33:22] and said
[33:23] maybe right now that's just how it came
[33:25] to me maybe right now
[33:26] i thought okay so i just got up my phone
[33:29] and said well lord i'm just gonna text
[33:30] him
[33:31] so you know i said to brother matthew i
[33:32] said i just texted him i said
[33:34] brother matthew said i've had you on my
[33:35] heart lord put you on my heart about
[33:37] the last few weeks i said i'll just make
[33:39] it real simple and ask you
[33:41] would you pray about leading songs
[33:42] tonight and i said and if not tonight
[33:44] then in the future and he just texted me
[33:46] back
[33:46] i'll call you right back and he calls me
[33:50] he says brother manny said
[33:51] i and i said let me just tell you so i
[33:53] told him what happened with my
[33:54] conversation and celadon with travis
[33:56] and uh and he said i was about to ask
[33:58] you the same thing he said in fact when
[34:00] you texted me and asked me these songs i
[34:01] was going to ask you did my dad call you
[34:03] and talk to you and ask me to
[34:04] ask you to ask me that i said really he
[34:07] said i was just in arizona and i just
[34:09] talked to my mom and dad
[34:10] about i guess maybe to pray about it or
[34:12] this was counseling with them and said i
[34:14] i want to pray about the lord for me to
[34:16] have a way to approach and let brother
[34:17] jason know
[34:18] and he said even this past weekend i had
[34:20] up my heart to talk to him but it didn't
[34:22] happen
[34:22] and now you're here asking me if i would
[34:24] lead songs tonight
[34:26] and i think you even said today you said
[34:28] the lord he told the lord lord i'll lead
[34:29] songs if someone will
[34:31] ask aren't you glad god does all things
[34:34] well give the lord a handclap of praise
[34:36] hallelujah

[34:44] for that well

[34:48] have you read and then we'll have you be
[34:49] seated
[34:50] i'm going to minister to you here
[34:51] tonight and the lord has just
[34:53] um given me this thought here today
[34:56] actually
[34:56] the past about a week ago he started
[34:58] dealing with my heart and putting it
[34:59] together today
[35:00] like always sometimes you have something
[35:03] and then it just gets larger
[35:04] so we'll just get to what portion he
[35:06] would have us get to amen and then we'll
[35:08] stop it's already 7 32 now
[35:10] i would like to speak to you on bride
[35:13] character
[35:14] bride character and there came unto me
[35:18] this is revelations 21
[35:19] 9 and there came unto me one of the
[35:21] seven angels
[35:23] which had the seven vials full of the
[35:25] seven last plagues
[35:26] talked with me saying come hither i will
[35:29] show thee the bride
[35:31] the lamb's wife also uh turn to
[35:34] revelations 19
[35:35] 1 scripture and we'll read this verse 7
[35:39] i know these are real familiar to you
[35:41] revelations 19 and verse 7.
[35:45] let us be glad and rejoice and give
[35:48] honor to him
[35:49] for the marriage of the lamb is come
[35:52] and his wife hath made herself
[35:56] ready lord we're grateful to be in your
[35:58] house gathered once again
[36:00] lord to those that are gathered here
[36:02] present father those that aren't here
[36:04] lord but maybe streaming on
[36:06] line lord i pray father you would just
[36:08] connect us all by your spirit
[36:10] lord may your spirit father be in this
[36:12] building be in this pulpit lord
[36:15] lord may you give us unction to speak
[36:17] this what you've put upon our heart
[36:20] lord all throughout the day you've just
[36:21] been dealing with me lord
[36:24] and i just want to be able to express
[36:26] that to your children
[36:27] lord i pray that we would have an
[36:28] expectation lord and not only that but
[36:31] ground lord that could receive the seed
[36:33] lord for your word is a seed and that's
[36:36] what we look that's what we long for
[36:37] here tonight god not the idea
[36:40] lord of the theory lord we we've had
[36:42] enough of man's theories lord what we
[36:44] long for is truth
[36:46] lord and i believe your bride just wants
[36:48] truth lord that's what stabilizes us in
[36:50] this hour
[36:51] now may you come and give it to us lord
[36:52] each and every single one in jesus
[36:54] christ's name
[36:55] amen you can be seated tonight
[37:06] amen
[37:10] les can you hear me okay you can hear me
[37:12] okay out there in the audience okay good
[37:17] i'd like to speak to you and brothers i
[37:18] sent you a powerpoint
[37:21] on bride character and if you want to
[37:23] display that
[37:24] you can go ahead and have that displayed
[37:26] and ready and
[37:28] i'd like to just begin speaking here
[37:30] about a lot of things that i'm sure that
[37:33] we are familiar with and things that
[37:36] we've heard
[37:36] you know many times we hear things
[37:38] growing up in the message maybe
[37:40] just uh sitting on a church pew and we
[37:42] hear many things
[37:44] many good things amen but we'd like to
[37:46] sometimes just go back and to center in
[37:48] on what is it
[37:49] that we believe and what is it that we
[37:51] teach and so
[37:52] we'd like to just maybe take some
[37:54] rudimentary things things that would be
[37:56] maybe simple to you uh or a rehearsal of
[38:00] things that you already know
[38:02] but i just believe the lord could
[38:03] quicken them amen tonight
[38:05] amen and so we i don't know what we'll
[38:07] get to it's amazing the lord started
[38:09] me in a certain direction and so i'm not
[38:11] really sure i felt like the lord gave me
[38:13] a big shift
[38:14] at the end of the day so i'm just
[38:16] trusting him and uh
[38:18] and and i just don't know where we'll
[38:20] get to with this but we'd just like to
[38:22] begin
[38:22] we read here in in revelations uh
[38:26] the very last book of the bible that
[38:28] it's talking about a bribe
[38:30] and the scripture in revelation speaks a
[38:32] lot more than the two scriptures that we
[38:34] read about this in revelations 21
[38:37] and also revelations uh 19 7.
[38:40] we know that scripture very well the
[38:42] bride has
[38:43] made herself ready but you know who is
[38:46] this bride that we speak
[38:47] of and we use that as a phrase the bride
[38:50] of jesus christ i'm
[38:52] and we have many different uh uh
[38:54] adjectives we'd use to describe that we
[38:56] would
[38:57] say she's the the wife of christ
[39:00] even the bible calls for that and says
[39:02] that his wife
[39:03] has made herself ready we would call her
[39:06] the elected
[39:08] lady brother brandon calls her that and
[39:10] says she's the elected
[39:12] lady by grace it's only by grace
[39:16] but the bible speaks of in revelations
[39:18] that there's this marriage
[39:20] of the lamb and so we see this
[39:22] relationship that god has
[39:24] and throughout the bible the bible is a
[39:26] book of marriage
[39:28] and we understand that that the the even
[39:30] the word is written in such a way
[39:33] that it would speak to many different
[39:35] classes of people
[39:36] it speaks to different many different uh
[39:38] what god what brother branham would take
[39:40] in the church age book and he would call
[39:42] that
[39:42] uh classes or he would call it
[39:45] designations
[39:46] of humanity we know there was
[39:49] designations of humanity all the way
[39:50] from the beginning
[39:52] with cain and abel that there was always
[39:55] brother branham said there was always
[39:57] uh twins of every revival amen and
[40:00] but we know that the bible is going to
[40:02] speak to the whole world
[40:04] it's going to have things that you that
[40:06] you read that has redemption for the
[40:08] jews
[40:09] that don't apply to us at all it's going
[40:11] to speak of the seven trumpets and the
[40:13] seven
[40:14] uh the seven thunders the seven sills
[40:16] the seven
[40:17] vials the seven stars we all know that
[40:21] that would have
[40:22] a designation that god was
[40:25] designating it or specifying it
[40:28] for a certain people a certain
[40:31] time and a certain purpose
[40:35] so what's important for us is it's one
[40:37] thing to understand what god is
[40:39] going to do with the jews we could we
[40:42] could spend weeks and
[40:43] and we could study about what god did uh
[40:46] with his jewish people and what god is
[40:49] going to do going to do and what he's
[40:50] doing presently what he's going to do in
[40:52] the future
[40:53] and it'd be good to understand that we
[40:55] could speak what god
[40:56] does to the heathen and and the one who
[40:59] never heard the gospel we can look at
[41:01] what god's going to do in the future
[41:03] to those that never had a chance to hear
[41:04] in the millennium yeah uh
[41:06] we could preach on any category of
[41:08] people we could preach on
[41:09] the foolish virgin we could preach on uh
[41:12] uh
[41:13] the make believer but tonight i want to
[41:15] turn our attention
[41:16] to the bride of jesus christ and i
[41:19] believe
[41:20] that it's important for us to understand
[41:22] what the scripture
[41:24] says not just for the whole world
[41:27] but for you and i yeah specifically how
[41:30] many can say lord i want to know that
[41:33] so we know that the bible is it's a book
[41:35] we could call it a book of
[41:37] marriage we find this all the way in the
[41:39] book in the
[41:40] in in the beginning with adam and eve
[41:42] you want to use this
[41:44] okay all right that helped my voice out
[41:47] a lot if i could hear myself
[41:50] amen all right god bless you there we go
[41:53] praise the lord so the bible is we said
[41:56] it's a
[41:57] it's a book of it's a book of marriage
[42:00] and we could see this even from the
[42:01] beginning uh in genesis
[42:04] the bible speaks of adam and his bride
[42:06] and
[42:07] you can go look at the first couple and
[42:08] you could see how the
[42:10] the scripture says in first corinthians
[42:12] 15 45
[42:14] the first man adam was made a living
[42:16] soul
[42:17] the last adam was made a quickening
[42:20] spirit
[42:21] so we know that adam and eve was real it
[42:23] was
[42:24] it was literal it wasn't an a
[42:26] allegorical it wasn't an analogy
[42:29] but it was two real people who really
[42:31] lived yet we know that their life would
[42:34] typify
[42:34] something greater than their life it
[42:37] would it would be spoken of even as we
[42:39] just read from the apostle paul when he
[42:41] spoke of the first adam
[42:43] and if there was a first adam there had
[42:45] to be a second adam
[42:46] and so we know that second man adam was
[42:49] the lord jesus christ
[42:50] we know that if there was a first eve
[42:52] there had to be a second eve
[42:54] if there was one man and adam all die
[42:57] then through the second man christ
[42:59] all live we know that if there was a
[43:02] first
[43:02] eve that fell there would come a second
[43:04] eve who
[43:05] didn't fall can you say amen and so
[43:08] god's thoughts are
[43:10] he's expressing something throughout the
[43:12] whole bible
[43:13] and he's telling us about the position
[43:15] that adam first held in the beginning
[43:17] the authority that adam had and then it
[43:20] goes on to speak of the fall of man and
[43:22] we know the restoration it was all going
[43:24] to be about the restoration
[43:26] and the redemption of man and don't let
[43:28] me lose you in some of this
[43:29] uh foundation here to stay with me close
[43:32] i believe it's going to uh it's going to
[43:34] just uh
[43:34] mean something here throughout but we
[43:37] know that the bible
[43:38] the the book of genesis uh means the
[43:41] seed book
[43:42] right it was the book of seeds it was
[43:44] the book of beginnings
[43:46] we know very much we could call it the
[43:48] alpha book
[43:49] we could call the book of revelation we
[43:51] could call the book of genesis the first
[43:53] book
[43:54] we could say revelations is the last
[43:56] book
[43:57] right we could say one was the the
[44:00] beginning once the end
[44:01] revelation the the the revelation the
[44:04] book of revelations was the ending of
[44:06] all things it was
[44:08] jesus says i am the first i am the last
[44:11] i am the alpha i am the omega
[44:14] so christ was throughout all of it
[44:16] through genesis to revelation
[44:17] so brother adam said if you can't see
[44:19] jesus in every verse
[44:21] go back and read your bible again
[44:24] because the bible speaks of men who
[44:26] would live
[44:26] parabolic lives even the life of noah
[44:29] the life of jonah when he goes into the
[44:32] belly of a well was a real
[44:34] happening but it spoke of something
[44:36] further it was a shadow
[44:37] it was a parable of what was going to
[44:39] happen to christ
[44:40] that he would say just as jonah was
[44:43] three days in the in the belly of a well
[44:44] so the son of man shall go into the
[44:47] belly of the earth and so when all of
[44:49] these things
[44:50] spoke of something ultimately it was all
[44:52] the plan of redemption it's any
[44:54] it's an i love uh uh brother aaron conte
[44:56] told
[44:57] said that years ago when i was just a
[44:58] teenager and i was trying to understand
[45:00] the book of revelation
[45:01] and he said brother matt you have to you
[45:03] have to write in your bible
[45:04] and he's and he showed me in his bible
[45:06] about every 100th page he has an
[45:08] arrow going left in the middle in the
[45:10] crease of his bible
[45:12] he had an arrow going this way and an
[45:14] arrow going that way and then a word
[45:16] eternal over top of it and he said just
[45:19] understand that everything you're
[45:20] reading
[45:20] it's an eternal book this book had no
[45:23] beginning it's the mind of god it's the
[45:25] word of god
[45:26] and it has no ending so it's it's multi
[45:29] it's has many types it has compound
[45:31] meanings it's the mind of god
[45:33] and it isn't just about the expression
[45:35] that god put on
[45:36] ink on paper but it was a thought
[45:39] expressed
[45:40] it was an eternal attribute of god the
[45:43] word of god is an eternal attribute it's
[45:44] his thought it's his mind
[45:46] so we know that the bible says that adam
[45:49] the first
[45:50] woman was made not from a different part
[45:53] of adam
[45:54] not from a part of the earth sorry but
[45:56] she was taken from the rib of adam so
[45:59] she was
[46:00] part of him and what was god the bible
[46:03] says in first corinthians 11 8 neither
[46:05] was the man created for the woman
[46:07] but the woman for the man brother
[46:09] brandon said she wasn't made of some
[46:10] outside material
[46:12] he says it wasn't another piece of dirt
[46:14] or god just picked up another
[46:16] piece of clay he said or else she'd just
[46:18] be a he said
[46:19] he said if that was the case that would
[46:20] show her position she's just made up the
[46:22] dirt like adam
[46:23] and he says but no she came out from
[46:26] adam she was
[46:27] part of adam that's why the bible says
[46:30] that
[46:30] adam looks at her and says thou art now
[46:33] bone of my bone
[46:34] flesh of my flesh thou shall be called
[46:37] as brother donny reagan says whoa man
[46:42] you shall be called woman because you
[46:44] came from the man you were part of the
[46:47] man
[46:48] and so we know that there was in genesis
[46:50] god was
[46:51] he says you're now born of my bone flesh
[46:53] of my flesh so what does that tell us
[46:55] the identity of eve was found in adam
[47:00] she could know who she was because of
[47:02] who adam was
[47:04] and in finding out or the revelation of
[47:06] adam would give her the revelation
[47:09] of herself and it's only when we know
[47:12] the second adam the man christ the word
[47:15] that we as the bride
[47:16] find our own identity and so
[47:20] genesis god is separating eve from adam
[47:23] but now there was going to be a bringing
[47:25] back of them together god removes that
[47:27] part of adam that feminist nature
[47:29] and he forms a woman and then he brings
[47:31] her back and introduces her brother
[47:33] branham says
[47:34] introduces eve to adam and she who was
[47:37] she
[47:38] she was adam in the female form
[47:44] right and just how she was
[47:47] adam expressed in a female form you
[47:51] are christ expressed in bride form
[47:54] i know this is very simple but it's
[47:56] profound when you really think about it
[47:58] who is the elected lady who is the bride
[48:00] of jesus christ she is
[48:02] jesus christ expressed in bride form
[48:06] she's born of his bone she's flesh of
[48:08] his flesh she's life of his life
[48:11] she was in the back part of god's mind
[48:13] before the foundation of the world and
[48:14] she's only been expressed in time in a
[48:16] body called time
[48:18] brother branham says you bypassed your
[48:20] theophany and so you come to this world
[48:22] to be tested and tempted and tried but
[48:24] you go back to your theophany
[48:26] who you really are who you really were
[48:30] we could just go on many different
[48:32] trails but we want to stay here
[48:33] close to our thought i don't want to
[48:35] spend all my time
[48:36] laying this foundation but i believe
[48:38] it's important
[48:39] and so god speaks of this first couple
[48:42] and we know that
[48:43] it shows us that this bride was part of
[48:46] the bridegroom that
[48:47] her identity was found in him and
[48:50] and now god then takes uh the role of
[48:53] of a marriage officer and god here's the
[48:57] first
[48:57] union brother adam says the first union
[48:59] the first couple
[49:01] the first what god you say who who's who
[49:04] instituted marriage
[49:05] god and when he instituted it he
[49:08] instituted it between a man and a woman
[49:10] amen so the world tries to redefine that
[49:14] the marriage covenant was between one
[49:16] man and one woman
[49:19] not one man and three women one man and
[49:21] one woman
[49:22] as brother as brother donnie says it
[49:25] wasn't
[49:25] even evelyn or brother harold beckett
[49:27] says it's not even evelyn
[49:29] it's not adam and steve it was adam and
[49:32] eve
[49:33] man and woman husband and wife and holy
[49:37] matrimony and he
[49:38] introduced the woman to adam
[49:41] and and and now adam introducing adam
[49:44] he was introducing himself in brian form
[49:48] and so the form was different but it was
[49:50] still adam
[49:52] she looked different than adam but it
[49:54] was still adam
[49:55] she had his mind she had his thoughts
[49:59] and brother branham says that even
[50:01] before adam uh could speak
[50:03] he illustrates and dramatizes this he
[50:05] says that eve would say
[50:08] you know what would speak something adam
[50:09] would say that's exactly what i was
[50:11] thinking
[50:12] she was in tune she was in sync she was
[50:14] in harmony because she was
[50:17] him only in a different form
[50:20] and so you the bible says here that
[50:23] we we know that the story goes on
[50:25] throughout genesis and you see this type
[50:27] of this bride
[50:29] even in adam and eve and now we know
[50:30] that that first eve falls
[50:33] but even throughout the entire bible
[50:35] what is the story of eliezer
[50:38] about uh the bible speaks of abraham and
[50:41] ali sends out
[50:42] uh eliezer to find uh jesus servant to
[50:45] go and find we don't
[50:47] we could preach an entire sermon on this
[50:48] here but i just want to
[50:50] pinch your minds here just for a moment
[50:52] when you read that story of eliezer
[50:54] who's the servant
[50:55] and and he goes to find a bride for
[50:57] isaac and he takes this long journey and
[50:59] and he has to wait at the well and and
[51:02] he prays uh you know
[51:03] uh uh for in a certain way for a certain
[51:06] woman
[51:06] uh and rebecca was going to have to
[51:08] respond in a certain way
[51:10] to identify to the servant that she was
[51:13] the bride of
[51:14] isaac and so it would show that
[51:17] that it would show us clearly uh that
[51:20] that it was god's choice
[51:22] it wasn't her own choice it was god's
[51:25] choice that he
[51:26] chose her to be a bride for isaac
[51:29] and so we when the bible says here of
[51:31] eliezer it says and he said o lord god
[51:33] of my master abraham i pray thee
[51:35] send me god good speed and show me
[51:37] kindness unto my master abraham behold i
[51:39] stand here by the well of water
[51:41] the daughters of the men of the city
[51:42] come out to drill of the city come out
[51:45] to draw water
[51:46] let it come to pass at the dams of the
[51:47] whom i shall say let down thy picture
[51:50] i pray that i may drink and she shall
[51:52] say drink and i will give thee thy
[51:54] camel's drink also let the same
[51:56] be she that has appointed for thy
[51:58] servant isaac
[51:59] and thereby shall i know that thou has
[52:01] showed kindness unto my master
[52:03] and it came to pass before he had done
[52:05] speaking that behold rebecca came out
[52:07] who was born to bethuel uh son of milka
[52:10] the wife of nahor abraham's brother
[52:12] with her picture upon her shoulder the
[52:14] damsel was very fair to look upon
[52:16] a virgin neither had any man known her
[52:19] and she went down to the well and
[52:20] filled her picture and came up and the
[52:23] servant ran to meet her and said let me
[52:25] i pray thee drink a little water
[52:27] of thy picture and she said drink my
[52:29] lord and she hastened and let down her
[52:32] picture upon her hand and gave him drink
[52:34] when she had done giving him drinks she
[52:36] said i will draw water for thy camels
[52:38] also
[52:39] until they have done drinking that's
[52:40] genesis chapter 24.
[52:42] and so now what are you seeing a picture
[52:44] of a bride
[52:46] who's appointed for isaac who was isaac
[52:49] a type of christ
[52:50] who are you a type of rebecca it was all
[52:53] a marriage book it was all a love story
[52:55] and eliezer spoke to her we know the
[52:58] story begins to speak about
[53:00] isaac and and and she and the brother
[53:02] and says she believed every word
[53:04] that he spoke to her about him and so
[53:07] what did god do in this age
[53:09] he sent a messenger an eliezer uh the
[53:12] seventh church age messenger and what
[53:14] did that what did brother branham do
[53:15] he wasn't pointing anybody to himself it
[53:17] wasn't about fallen in love with eliezer
[53:20] or brother branham it was about
[53:22] he he told us about christ and we
[53:24] believed every word that he said
[53:26] he told us about the character of jesus
[53:28] christ and we believed every word that
[53:30] he said
[53:30] he expressed the character of christ and
[53:33] when we heard it we heard the voice of
[53:35] god
[53:35] when we heard the voice of god we
[53:36] weren't hearing the voice of a man
[53:39] we're hearing the voice of our beloved
[53:41] can you say amen
[53:43] and so the bible says that this uh story
[53:46] here
[53:47] you go on beyond that and the bible says
[53:50] jesus speaking in john chapter 10 and
[53:52] you already have my power point up
[53:54] that's just fine you can hold it there
[53:56] if you have a bible you can turn to john
[53:58] chapter 10 or i'll just read it to you
[54:00] uh he says we'll just do that because
[54:03] i'm going to turn to a few of them and
[54:04] it'll take you too long to
[54:05] to find them but this is john 10 27 and
[54:08] i want you to notice
[54:10] that that the it wasn't just genesis
[54:12] that speaks of a bride it wasn't just
[54:15] the story of eliezer it wasn't just what
[54:17] was the the theme of
[54:19] of the song of songs ellie
[54:22] solomon's song of solomon which means
[54:25] the song of songs it's
[54:27] like the king of kings it's the song of
[54:29] all songs and what was his greatest
[54:31] song that's what the song of songs means
[54:33] this was solomon's
[54:34] greatest song what was it about a bride
[54:38] and a groom and a bride who's waiting
[54:42] for her
[54:42] groom my beloved behold he quickly
[54:44] cometh i see him through the lattice
[54:46] what is solomon describing
[54:48] he's describing you say brother matt why
[54:50] what is this why is this important
[54:52] because this was to the bride this was
[54:54] to identify
[54:55] you this is your portion in the word of
[54:59] god
[55:02] the story of brother branham tells of
[55:04] the jewish the the first old testament
[55:06] bride and how she falls away then
[55:08] there's a
[55:08] you know the brother branham says but
[55:10] god's going to have him a pure
[55:11] unadulterated spotless chaste virgin
[55:14] the apostle paul speaks of this jesus
[55:16] spoke of that bride
[55:18] who would be made up that bride of jesus
[55:21] christ who would be in obedience to the
[55:23] word
[55:24] and who is that bride is she an
[55:26] organization no
[55:28] right is she uh is she
[55:32] does she have some headquarters no no
[55:34] headquarters at all
[55:36] it's an it's you say brother matt who is
[55:38] it it's individuals
[55:41] and jesus would speak to individuals not
[55:43] a group body
[55:45] but collectively they would make up the
[55:47] bride of jesus christ
[55:49] you say where would they come from the
[55:51] whole world
[55:54] what language would they speak every
[55:55] language in the world
[55:57] uh one organization no sort no uh
[56:00] organization
[56:01] what what kind of people all kinds of
[56:03] people from all kinds of walks of life
[56:06] from all kinds of backgrounds all colors
[56:08] of skin but she would be the bride
[56:10] the many membered mystical bride of
[56:13] jesus christ
[56:15] jesus says my sheep hear my voice and i
[56:18] know them and they
[56:19] follow me uh he says in john 15 4 abide
[56:24] in me and i in you
[56:25] as the branch cannot bear fruit of
[56:26] itself except it abide in me
[56:29] if you abide in me and my words abide in
[56:31] you you shall ask what you will and it
[56:33] shall be done
[56:34] he says in john 14 15 if you love me
[56:37] keep my commandments so
[56:38] the apostle paul begins to speak about
[56:40] this and he says in ephesians husbands
[56:43] love your wives even as christ also
[56:46] loved the church and gave himself
[56:50] for it that he might sanctify cleanse it
[56:53] with the washing of the water
[56:55] by the word that he might present it
[56:58] to himself a glorious church
[57:02] not having spot or wrinkle or any such
[57:05] thing
[57:06] but that it should be holy and without
[57:09] blemish so what is paul beginning to
[57:12] speak of he
[57:13] takes the same the same uh uh
[57:16] uh a story of marriage the same story of
[57:20] union you find in genesis and eliezer in
[57:22] the song of solomon and
[57:24] and and and now paul begins to say i'm
[57:26] i'm jealous over you with a godly
[57:29] jealousy for i've espoused you to one
[57:31] husband
[57:32] so he starts to talk about this and in
[57:34] the ephesians and he goes on he says
[57:36] husbands love your wife just as christ
[57:38] loved the church
[57:39] for he says so want men to love their
[57:41] wives as their own bodies
[57:43] he that loveth his wife loveth himself
[57:47] for no man ever yet hated his own flesh
[57:50] but
[57:50] nourisheth and cherisheth it even as
[57:54] the lord the church
[57:57] for we are members of his body of his
[58:00] flesh
[58:01] and of his bones for this cause
[58:04] shall a man leave his father and mother
[58:06] shall be joined unto his wife and they
[58:08] too shall be one flesh and then paul
[58:11] stomps
[58:12] because now is going to take the
[58:14] compound meaning is he talking about a
[58:16] literal husband and wife relationship
[58:19] yes husbands love your wives
[58:23] oh the wife says amen
[58:27] but then he stops and he says but
[58:29] there's a greater mystery in this you
[58:30] see because the word isn't just going to
[58:32] speak to one literal husband and wife
[58:34] then he says this is a great mystery
[58:38] but i speak concerning christ and the
[58:41] church
[58:43] so what's he identifying there would be
[58:45] a many membered body
[58:47] that comes from all walks of life a
[58:49] glorious church that would be holy
[58:51] and without blemish and would be a
[58:54] chaste virgin
[58:55] unto christ say brother matt why did you
[58:58] take all that time to lay out the
[58:59] foundation
[59:00] because i believe it's important rather
[59:03] than just quoting quotes and saying
[59:05] brother branham said
[59:06] to go back to our bible and say this is
[59:08] where this comes from it's a principle
[59:10] right here in the word
[59:13] i didn't make this up i just read it to
[59:15] you brother branham didn't make this
[59:16] up the prophet of god it wasn't his own
[59:19] doctrine it wasn't his own teaching
[59:21] it's only a restoration of the original
[59:23] word that's what we believe
[59:27] can you say amen uh we we we know this
[59:31] that the bible says that
[59:33] just as and so we could we could lay
[59:35] foundation of that i'm gonna read you
[59:36] something here
[59:37] and i just believe it's so good and i i
[59:39] got this really
[59:41] chopped up so forgive me while i i just
[59:44] find this
[59:45] find my place here i want to make sure
[59:47] that the
[59:48] that i get that i get this right
[59:51] uh and let me just find the find the
[59:54] right
[59:55] uh quote here i want to make sure we get
[59:57] get the right one because i got this
[59:59] chopped up on the wrong
[1:00:00] on the wrong one let me just find it
[1:00:02] here um
[1:00:05] let me just find my place here uh he
[1:00:08] says no matter how much teaching you got
[1:00:10] you can drum that into you god is not in
[1:00:12] big words
[1:00:12] i love this god is not in big words
[1:00:16] uh god is in an honest heart you might
[1:00:19] stand here and speak big words like i
[1:00:21] don't know what that doesn't bring you
[1:00:23] closer to god
[1:00:24] you can stand and practice how to repeat
[1:00:26] your sermon and say these things
[1:00:28] that don't get you closer to god you can
[1:00:30] learn dictionary till you sleep with one
[1:00:32] and it still wouldn't get you closer to
[1:00:34] god
[1:00:35] a humble submitted heart
[1:00:38] in the simplicity is what brings you to
[1:00:42] god amen and that's true amen
[1:00:45] a humble heart god loves no matter if
[1:00:48] you don't know your abcs that don't make
[1:00:50] any difference
[1:00:51] just a humble heart
[1:00:54] god dwells in a humble heart i want to
[1:00:56] get to these but i want to make sure we
[1:00:57] get to the right
[1:00:59] the right spot here he says the god of
[1:01:01] this evil age now notice
[1:01:02] her long hair nazarite vow to the word
[1:01:06] i'll picture the bride of christ now we
[1:01:09] picture the antichrist where she is
[1:01:11] religious and everything science and he
[1:01:14] speaks about that and god of this evil
[1:01:15] age and he's going to identify that
[1:01:17] antichrist
[1:01:18] he says but now let me give you the
[1:01:20] image of the bride because we're
[1:01:21] preaching on
[1:01:22] bride character and he says we picture
[1:01:25] the antichrist where she is religious
[1:01:27] and everything science
[1:01:28] now the humble little bride of christ
[1:01:30] just simply
[1:01:32] believes the word amen
[1:01:36] remember let's just picture the bride of
[1:01:39] christ here
[1:01:40] senator matt how do we identify what is
[1:01:43] what is the identity how do you
[1:01:45] what is the character of the bride of
[1:01:48] jesus christ brother branham says he
[1:01:49] makes it so simple and i love the words
[1:01:51] he uses
[1:01:52] he says now the humble little bride of
[1:01:54] christ just
[1:01:56] simply believes the word whoever she is
[1:02:01] that doesn't point to any group doesn't
[1:02:03] even point to himself
[1:02:05] but he's going to identify will picture
[1:02:08] the bride
[1:02:08] she just believes the word she can't
[1:02:11] always
[1:02:12] explain it and that's okay she believes
[1:02:14] it
[1:02:15] amen i know that makes a lot of
[1:02:17] intellectual people
[1:02:18] upset we got to understand it we've got
[1:02:20] to we've got to have we've got an
[1:02:22] understanding of the word of god brother
[1:02:23] adam says that whether she understands
[1:02:25] it or not
[1:02:26] she believes it she simply believes the
[1:02:30] word
[1:02:31] whoever she is
[1:02:35] he goes on he says it's individuals
[1:02:39] i hope and trust that there's many
[1:02:41] sitting present many listening in and
[1:02:43] notice this
[1:02:44] and i hope that myself and every one of
[1:02:47] you all
[1:02:48] are part of that bride
[1:02:51] notice what he's saying here he doesn't
[1:02:53] even say and i know that i am oh bless
[1:02:56] god you know i can see the opening i
[1:02:58] preach the opening of the seven seals
[1:03:00] i'm the bride of jesus christ here we
[1:03:01] are
[1:03:02] in 1965 and he says and i hope that
[1:03:05] myself
[1:03:07] amen what is he doing
[1:03:10] look beyond the words he's identifying
[1:03:13] the character
[1:03:15] of the bride what is the character of
[1:03:18] the bride oh bless god i'm in the bride
[1:03:20] no
[1:03:20] it's i hope i'm in the bride by his
[1:03:22] grace i will be
[1:03:23] all i want to do is believe it confess
[1:03:26] it and live it
[1:03:29] he says i hope and every one of you are
[1:03:31] part of that bride i hope many
[1:03:33] and it will all that's been ordained to
[1:03:36] that
[1:03:36] will be that yes
[1:03:40] now we can make this so complicated
[1:03:44] but it's so simple
[1:03:47] amen brother matt who's going to be the
[1:03:50] bride who's who's in the bride and who's
[1:03:51] not
[1:03:54] all that's been ordained to yeah amen
[1:03:56] that will be that
[1:03:59] say who's it going to be is it going to
[1:04:01] be the people we we force and we
[1:04:03] pressure when we've put him into fear no
[1:04:05] no she just simply believes the word
[1:04:08] you say but the man are you part of that
[1:04:10] i trust and believe in hope that i am
[1:04:12] amen brother branham says
[1:04:16] it'll it that's all that's been under he
[1:04:18] says every one of you are part of that
[1:04:19] right i hope many and it will all that's
[1:04:21] been ordained to that will be that
[1:04:23] cuz it's here's why because it's their
[1:04:27] nature in other words
[1:04:30] if she's the bride she'll act like the
[1:04:32] bride
[1:04:34] if she's god's cha if if she's the wife
[1:04:36] of christ
[1:04:38] she will be you don't have to force her
[1:04:39] you have to press her you have to
[1:04:41] pressure you won't have to
[1:04:42] fear tactic her into it it's who she is
[1:04:46] she wants to live this way she wants to
[1:04:49] dress this way
[1:04:50] she wants to act this way because it's
[1:04:52] her nature that's inside of her
[1:04:55] you know i fear sometimes we we spend
[1:04:57] too much time
[1:04:58] trying to force people into a mode of
[1:05:01] something that they're really not
[1:05:05] is that okay i believe we have to be
[1:05:08] careful because
[1:05:09] you can't make a person a believer
[1:05:13] you can't make them a believer no one
[1:05:15] could make me one all the prayers of my
[1:05:17] mom all the prayers of my dad couldn't
[1:05:18] make me one
[1:05:20] god had to make me one you can't force
[1:05:23] someone to believe you can't force
[1:05:25] someone you can
[1:05:26] you can try but unless it's in their
[1:05:29] heart brother branham says all that's
[1:05:30] ordained
[1:05:32] you say brother matt who's going to be a
[1:05:33] believer those that are believers
[1:05:37] because it's in their nature listen to
[1:05:39] what he says here
[1:05:40] the word can only recognize let me make
[1:05:43] sure that's right the word can
[1:05:44] only recognize the word
[1:05:47] the word can only recognize
[1:05:51] the word it can't recognize
[1:05:54] nothing and he stops a wheat can't be
[1:05:57] nothing but a wheat
[1:06:00] it started a wheat it'll head up a wheat
[1:06:03] and a weed
[1:06:05] can never be a wheat yet it's
[1:06:08] watered by the same anointing
[1:06:12] see but it ate a wheat
[1:06:15] amen listen to me friends no matter how
[1:06:18] much
[1:06:18] we try to force a weed to be a wheat
[1:06:21] it'll never be a wheat
[1:06:26] no matter how much you try to force it
[1:06:28] brother adam says a week can be nothing
[1:06:30] but a week at start of the week it'll
[1:06:31] head up a week
[1:06:32] and a weed can never be a wheat yet it's
[1:06:34] watered by the sow someone could sit
[1:06:36] under the same anointing
[1:06:38] but if it's not a wheat it'll never be a
[1:06:41] wheat it'll
[1:06:42] always be a weed who is the bride of
[1:06:45] jesus christ they are
[1:06:47] exactly who god has ordained before the
[1:06:49] foundation of the world to be the bride
[1:06:51] of christ
[1:06:52] and it's not an organization it's not a
[1:06:54] group it's not a clique
[1:06:56] it's not a denomination amen it's
[1:06:59] individuals
[1:07:02] uh brother adam says i'm having trouble
[1:07:04] here he says her long hair
[1:07:06] nazarite val there we go it's working
[1:07:08] shows that she's
[1:07:09] vowed to god her beautiful gown
[1:07:12] of his promised word for the age that
[1:07:15] she is living in
[1:07:16] wrapped around her vindicating her with
[1:07:19] himself of hebrews 13 8
[1:07:21] jesus christ the same yesterday today
[1:07:24] and forever
[1:07:25] and she's part of the word groom true to
[1:07:28] him in every point
[1:07:32] now he's identifying the bride here
[1:07:34] right
[1:07:36] she's true to him in every point
[1:07:40] now look if a woman goes out here and is
[1:07:42] married to a man
[1:07:43] she goes out and makes love with another
[1:07:45] man has an affairs with him and come
[1:07:46] back to her husband he should kick her
[1:07:47] out is that right
[1:07:49] she must be true to him now he's using a
[1:07:51] a a human example to typify something
[1:07:54] spiritual
[1:07:55] a mystery behold i speak a mystery of
[1:07:57] christ in the church
[1:07:59] not all who say lord lord shall enter in
[1:08:02] not all who are saved are bride
[1:08:06] not all whose christians are elect
[1:08:10] this was in the very beginning even in
[1:08:12] genesis and eliezer what are we using
[1:08:14] we're using all of these types to show
[1:08:16] you that
[1:08:17] that god loves the whole world there's
[1:08:19] many who will be his children but then
[1:08:21] there's an elected group of people who
[1:08:23] are
[1:08:24] different they're his bride
[1:08:28] he said brother matt i know who it'll be
[1:08:29] it'll be those with long dresses long
[1:08:31] hair and
[1:08:32] they that that group no no it won't no
[1:08:35] it won't be them
[1:08:36] you say then who will it be it'll be
[1:08:38] those who god ordained to be
[1:08:42] amen you so so what do you say about
[1:08:45] what i'm saying is
[1:08:45] that you can have all of those things
[1:08:47] but if you're a weed you'll always be a
[1:08:49] weed if you're a wheat
[1:08:50] you'll always be a weed
[1:08:53] and a true believer an elected family of
[1:08:56] god
[1:08:56] some of the madness are you saying that
[1:08:58] we shouldn't have long hair and long no
[1:09:00] i'm not saying that
[1:09:00] that's not that's that's who you are
[1:09:02] it's not something you do as a result
[1:09:04] it's it's not it's not what you do to
[1:09:06] make you the bride you do that because
[1:09:08] that's who you are
[1:09:12] it's you say brother matt it goes to our
[1:09:14] conviction it goes
[1:09:15] it goes to our intellect no it goes
[1:09:16] further than your intellect
[1:09:18] goes to our conviction no it goes
[1:09:20] further to your conviction then it's in
[1:09:21] the heart no it's even further than the
[1:09:22] heart it's you know where it's at
[1:09:24] it's in the dna of who you are
[1:09:28] it's it's your gene that's why brother
[1:09:30] brandon's called it a gene
[1:09:31] seed of god and we as much as we can try
[1:09:35] we can never
[1:09:35] force that god's got to do that right
[1:09:39] amen brother adam says here and the
[1:09:42] bride of christ is vowed to christ he's
[1:09:44] the word not even weak at the other side
[1:09:46] a woman should not even weaken another
[1:09:48] man she should make no signs
[1:09:49] no emotions at all towards him for she
[1:09:51] is absolutely a bride
[1:09:53] to one bridegroom we don't want none of
[1:09:57] your mixed
[1:09:57] trees your denominations be true to
[1:10:01] christ the word
[1:10:02] he'll vindicate it to be true no sir not
[1:10:04] even any
[1:10:05] emotion of anything towards making love
[1:10:08] to him not
[1:10:09] join his ranks or anything else or or
[1:10:12] let him get in your arms or or in his
[1:10:14] care
[1:10:15] or talk to you over this way that way
[1:10:17] you listen
[1:10:18] only to his voice
[1:10:24] whose voice the voice of your beloved
[1:10:25] the voice of your husband
[1:10:28] and that's not your pastor and that's
[1:10:29] not the prophet
[1:10:32] you say brother matt who's my spiritual
[1:10:34] husband not the prophet not your pastor
[1:10:37] your spiritual husband is the husband of
[1:10:39] all christ
[1:10:42] you listen only to one voice my sheep
[1:10:44] know my voice a stranger
[1:10:47] what is his voice listen to what he says
[1:10:49] here
[1:10:50] any man's voice is his word
[1:10:54] and this is it the bible
[1:10:59] not one word to be added to it or taken
[1:11:01] away just stay
[1:11:03] right with that voice
[1:11:07] a stranger they won't follow a
[1:11:08] denomination she's part of the groom
[1:11:11] true to him in every point waiting for
[1:11:14] the wedding
[1:11:15] uniting not at the ecumenical council
[1:11:18] but in the sky
[1:11:20] at the wedding supper she's been given
[1:11:22] this is for our church
[1:11:23] she has been given and revealed to her
[1:11:26] the seven
[1:11:27] seal mysteries of the bible she sees the
[1:11:30] folly of the deceiver
[1:11:32] so you say for the man see all of these
[1:11:34] are identifying signs because she sees
[1:11:37] the the because she sees the revelation
[1:11:39] of the seven
[1:11:40] seals because she sees the false church
[1:11:42] then she's the bride no
[1:11:43] no no no no you got it backwards because
[1:11:46] she's the bride
[1:11:47] she sees the revelation of the seven
[1:11:49] seals because she's the bride she sees
[1:11:52] the two vines in the same church
[1:11:54] because she's the bride shall overcome
[1:11:56] the world
[1:11:57] and the lies and deceptions of the world
[1:12:00] because who she
[1:12:01] is is found in christ

[1:13:54] they have a zeal
[1:13:56] in their heart for jesus they have a

[1:14:30] brother adam says what will she be she
[1:14:32] won't be a lukewarm lady of seeing
[1:14:34] he says that bride of that last day she
[1:14:36] won't be a lukewarm
[1:14:37] she'll be fervent she'll be on fire
[1:14:40] she'll be in love
[1:14:41] she'll be madly in love with the lord
[1:14:46] she won't be falling away she'll be
[1:14:48] falling in love
[1:14:51] do you want to fall in love with him all
[1:14:53] over again
[1:14:55] and so they they they're love their love
[1:14:58] they're betrothal
[1:14:59] they're in expectation they're in love
[1:15:02] let me let me just preach to you here on
[1:15:03] the
[1:15:04] the character identifying this character
[1:15:06] they're marked
[1:15:08] by their love not their knowledge
[1:15:12] they're marked by their love not their
[1:15:14] knowledge
[1:15:15] who will be the bride those who have all
[1:15:17] the revelations all the mysteries and
[1:15:18] they can line up every seal and
[1:15:20] every horse rider and every vile every
[1:15:21] plague every trumpet they'll be they'll
[1:15:23] know everything
[1:15:24] don't know who the no it's not they're
[1:15:25] not known by their knowledge
[1:15:28] they're known by their love of the word
[1:15:30] of god
[1:15:32] they may not be able to explain it but
[1:15:34] they love it they may not be able to
[1:15:36] extribute but there's an
[1:15:37] attraction they're attracted to the word
[1:15:39] of god they long for it they thirst for
[1:15:42] it it's their daily bread
[1:15:45] because it's who they are
[1:15:48] they won't be known by their knowledge
[1:15:49] they'll be marked by their love
[1:15:52] of him
[1:15:55] what do we have in churches today
[1:15:56] millions of denominations thousands of
[1:15:58] dimensional churches
[1:15:59] marked by intellectual uh by an
[1:16:02] intellectual gospel an intellectual
[1:16:04] pursuit you said for the man oh we're
[1:16:05] condemning them no no no no that's what
[1:16:07] they're called to
[1:16:09] they're god's children not preaching
[1:16:12] against that
[1:16:13] necessarily we could preach against
[1:16:14] certain things of it but god didn't call
[1:16:17] us to theology
[1:16:19] is that okay i'm just going to say that
[1:16:20] here tonight god didn't call us to
[1:16:22] seminary
[1:16:24] god didn't call us to education god
[1:16:26] called us to a
[1:16:27] love letter and a love relationship
[1:16:32] one that's known brother branham says
[1:16:34] though he knew his bible really well
[1:16:35] brother branham says i may not know the
[1:16:37] author he says i may not know his book
[1:16:39] but
[1:16:39] i know his i know the author and he said
[1:16:42] i'd rather know the author than know his
[1:16:44] book i'd rather know
[1:16:45] him paul said to know him is life
[1:16:49] can you say amen tonight so what what is
[1:16:52] it
[1:16:53] what you say brother man are we
[1:16:54] preaching no but i'll go this far as to
[1:16:56] say
[1:16:57] it's the intellectual theological
[1:16:59] seminaries
[1:17:00] that produces the ladies and lukewarm
[1:17:04] church that kicked christ out right
[1:17:08] brother branham says in revelations 3
[1:17:10] christ was
[1:17:11] outside of the church knocking behold i
[1:17:14] stand at the door but brother adam said
[1:17:16] how did they get him how did he get out
[1:17:18] there
[1:17:18] they kicked him out of their church says
[1:17:21] they didn't want this
[1:17:22] sin killing sky blue holy ghost filled
[1:17:26] religion they didn't want that kind of
[1:17:27] pentecostal experience
[1:17:29] so they kicked him out and they traded
[1:17:31] him not for heathens not for idols not
[1:17:33] for voodoo
[1:17:35] for religion cain was very religious we
[1:17:38] know that
[1:17:39] he says cain was more religious than
[1:17:40] abel was
[1:17:43] but he says but he didn't want to do the
[1:17:45] will of god his pride
[1:17:46] kept him from him so this this this the
[1:17:50] all this church
[1:17:51] uh that their bible schools their
[1:17:53] seminaries they're filled with teachers
[1:17:56] uh who spent years engrossed in language
[1:17:59] and doctrine i forget
[1:18:01] uh brother jason how many you told me
[1:18:02] before to be a get a doctor of
[1:18:05] uh of theology you have to know phi is
[1:18:06] it five languages
[1:18:08] five languages could you imagine just to
[1:18:10] get your degree you have to know five
[1:18:12] languages
[1:18:15] by the matter are you preaching against
[1:18:16] it no i want to be so
[1:18:18] clear i'm not preaching against it they
[1:18:21] are doing what god has called them to do
[1:18:24] and how dare we stand by and criticize
[1:18:27] the bible says all fruits will bring
[1:18:30] forth after their own kind
[1:18:32] amen they're they're schools but but
[1:18:35] but yet i am saying it is that that
[1:18:38] produces
[1:18:40] the the church that jesus says you're
[1:18:43] not hot you're not cold you're lukewarm
[1:18:44] so i'll spew you out of my mouth
[1:18:47] can you say amen they they they they
[1:18:50] study
[1:18:51] uh they spend years engrossed in the
[1:18:54] doctrines and the theology and
[1:18:56] they're engrossed and desp
[1:18:59] the even the inerrancy of the bible and
[1:19:02] and the textual variances of the bible
[1:19:04] the different translations and all of
[1:19:07] all of these things from a historical
[1:19:09] standpoint you're saying that is
[1:19:10] anything wrong nothing's wrong with that
[1:19:11] but let me just stop here and say
[1:19:13] something very simply
[1:19:14] we're not called to that we're called to
[1:19:17] believe the word of god
[1:19:19] not under not even understand you said
[1:19:21] but man does that mean we don't
[1:19:22] understand no god gives us understanding
[1:19:24] but it doesn't come by school it comes
[1:19:26] by revelation
[1:19:29] and even after you get a revelation you
[1:19:31] can't always describe it or put it on
[1:19:32] paper
[1:19:34] amen say describe it to me i can't then
[1:19:36] how do you believe it i don't know i
[1:19:38] just do
[1:19:38] amen give me the description put it on
[1:19:41] put it on a chalkboard i i can put some
[1:19:44] stuff here and there and i can line up
[1:19:45] certain stuff but
[1:19:47] brother branham says who are they says
[1:19:48] the true believer just humbly
[1:19:50] believes the word of god amen
[1:19:53] whoever she is they're intelligent
[1:19:56] they're they're ex they've exalted
[1:19:58] themself
[1:20:00] they're prideful about their large uh
[1:20:03] uh uh groups and programs uh let me just
[1:20:06] say this to you today
[1:20:08] they they they uh let me make sure don't
[1:20:11] miss this here
[1:20:12] just for a moment so that last day
[1:20:15] church is filled with intellect
[1:20:17] knowledge uh
[1:20:18] intellectual but but then there's a
[1:20:21] group of people
[1:20:22] who have accepted him not on the basis
[1:20:24] of knowledge but on the basis of love
[1:20:27] brother branham stops and i'm going to
[1:20:28] bring this powerpoint up here and i'm
[1:20:30] going to go to the very beginning you
[1:20:31] see how backwards i had it
[1:20:32] but i just want to catch some of these
[1:20:34] because this is what the lord originally
[1:20:36] started dealing with me on so lest we
[1:20:38] miss it uh
[1:20:39] i want to make sure we we catch it and i
[1:20:41] won't read all these don't get scared
[1:20:42] everyone's getting so scared might as
[1:20:46] well just preach till sunday more than
[1:20:47] that
[1:20:48] brother adam says wait on this is this
[1:20:49] is bright character
[1:20:51] wait on one another be servants to one
[1:20:55] another
[1:20:56] don't be bigger than somebody else try
[1:20:59] to see how little you can be
[1:21:02] i've often heard it say don't never be
[1:21:04] big in your own side if you're big let
[1:21:05] it be
[1:21:06] in god's sight belittle in your own
[1:21:09] sight
[1:21:10] every man that humbles himself god will
[1:21:12] exalt
[1:21:13] but those who exalt themselves god will
[1:21:16] abase
[1:21:17] see belittle what are you preaching on
[1:21:21] bride character uh he says
[1:21:24] no now both sides if you notice it
[1:21:26] started in genesis
[1:21:28] religious on both sides one of them
[1:21:30] denominational now that goes to the
[1:21:31] denominational church
[1:21:33] high-minded the other
[1:21:36] humble walking in the spirit by
[1:21:39] revelation
[1:21:40] you mean revelation doesn't exalt
[1:21:42] revelation
[1:21:43] humbles how could abel ever know that it
[1:21:47] was a lamb instead of fruits on the from
[1:21:49] the field because it was revealed to him
[1:21:52] by a divine revelation
[1:21:55] what's the denomination trying to do
[1:21:57] exalt itself like lucifer
[1:22:00] they so called themselves the church the
[1:22:02] bride
[1:22:04] which they are in revelation uh 17 as it
[1:22:07] is spoke of the false bride
[1:22:09] above christ little flock the bride
[1:22:11] lucifer thinks and exalts himself above
[1:22:14] the humble word of god's truth
[1:22:16] by the knowledge of the revelation and
[1:22:18] has placed himself by a seminary
[1:22:20] education
[1:22:21] and theology until they have gotten
[1:22:23] themselves up
[1:22:25] and if you don't belong to their group
[1:22:26] then you are an
[1:22:28] outwash i've heard of an outcast and
[1:22:30] i'll know what an outwash is
[1:22:34] now you see why we have so many
[1:22:36] different denominations
[1:22:38] you see why we have so much confusion
[1:22:41] one believing this the other one
[1:22:42] believing that
[1:22:43] because the spiritual rev because
[1:22:45] because the spiritual
[1:22:47] revealed truth has to come through god
[1:22:50] alone
[1:22:50] the words hid from the eyes of the wise
[1:22:52] and pruding god said so
[1:22:53] and he reveals it to babes such as we'll
[1:22:57] learn
[1:22:57] so be a baby
[1:23:02] amen that didn't get a lot of amen
[1:23:04] jealous
[1:23:06] so be a high proud intellectual message
[1:23:09] believer no
[1:23:11] be a baby humble yourself
[1:23:15] and say oh god here i am
[1:23:18] just make yourself known to me i love
[1:23:21] you
[1:23:22] god will reveal himself to you he'll
[1:23:25] make himself
[1:23:26] himself known to you how do i know more
[1:23:29] of god
[1:23:30] make yourself a baby humble yourself
[1:23:34] you say then how do i know more of god
[1:23:36] humble yourself
[1:23:37] more how do i get greater get littler
[1:23:42] get smaller humbling ourselves to the
[1:23:45] word brother
[1:23:46] says in these theologians see this bible
[1:23:48] they read it but they don't want to do
[1:23:49] it see it shows the serpent seed they've
[1:23:51] seen it vindicated and so simply before
[1:23:52] the people
[1:23:53] but it seems like it's so hard for
[1:23:55] people to humble themselves to the word
[1:23:56] of god
[1:23:58] don't you he says you're all fine you're
[1:23:59] talking women to girls about wearing
[1:24:01] long hair they say well
[1:24:02] why you got to have long hair see why do
[1:24:04] you wear skirts down long you got you go
[1:24:06] to talking to them they kind of give you
[1:24:07] the shoulder isn't that right
[1:24:09] see they know that's right if there's
[1:24:11] any lady in them
[1:24:12] they know that's right but you see they
[1:24:14] can't humble themselves
[1:24:16] to that see how cain did
[1:24:19] he couldn't humble himself to the
[1:24:22] vindicated word of god
[1:24:24] he couldn't do it you know brother adam
[1:24:27] says this and this is this is powerful
[1:24:29] here
[1:24:30] he says abel's message had been received
[1:24:32] cain saw it
[1:24:33] knowed that god had vindicated that
[1:24:34] message right but he just
[1:24:36] couldn't do it i thought about that he
[1:24:39] just
[1:24:40] couldn't do it his pride kept him from
[1:24:43] it
[1:24:44] that's right his pride kept him from
[1:24:47] doing it
[1:24:49] he says in god's power to transform so
[1:24:51] it seems to be so now
[1:24:52] so hard for people to humble themselves
[1:24:54] to the word of god they just don't want
[1:24:56] to do it they'll humble themselves to
[1:24:58] the
[1:24:58] to the creed of the church sure but not
[1:25:00] the word of god
[1:25:03] not the word of god i i you know i
[1:25:05] thought about that
[1:25:06] today and over the last couple weeks you
[1:25:09] know
[1:25:09] pride it is so easy to recognize
[1:25:13] pride in someone else but it's
[1:25:16] so hard to recognize pride in yourself
[1:25:21] let me just admit it here today we all
[1:25:23] have a huge
[1:25:24] blind spot to pride
[1:25:27] in ourselves and brother branham says
[1:25:31] what is the characteristic of the bride
[1:25:33] she's not proud she's not love boasteth
[1:25:35] not it's not arrogant it's not puffed up
[1:25:37] it's not prideful
[1:25:40] james the book of james says humble
[1:25:42] yourself in the sight of god resist the
[1:25:44] proud
[1:25:46] so humble yourself in the side of the
[1:25:48] lord and he'll lift you up
[1:25:50] what is it saying what is the
[1:25:52] characteristic of the bride brother and
[1:25:53] repeats it over and over
[1:25:55] she just humbly simply believes the word
[1:25:58] of god
[1:25:59] amen she has a humble attitude he says
[1:26:01] no matter how much teaching you got
[1:26:03] we already read this god's not a big
[1:26:04] word he's in an honest heart let me go
[1:26:06] pass
[1:26:06] some of this here he says god dwells in
[1:26:09] a humble heart
[1:26:11] not in education not in schools not in
[1:26:14] theology
[1:26:15] seminaries not in all these other
[1:26:17] different places not in big words
[1:26:20] not in classical places god dwells
[1:26:24] in human heart and the lower you can
[1:26:27] break yourself
[1:26:28] down the more simple
[1:26:33] you can become greater in the sight of
[1:26:36] god
[1:26:36] amen now notice
[1:26:40] brother branham says we just we just
[1:26:42] read this she simply believes the word
[1:26:45] whoever she is i was broken up and i'm
[1:26:47] sorry
[1:26:49] let me get to the same spot here
[1:26:54] because she's vowed to him the bride of
[1:26:55] christ is vowed to christ uh
[1:26:58] let me just get to it here and he says
[1:27:01] see the two opposing spirits at work in
[1:27:03] his evil age can you see that
[1:27:04] each very religious canaan abel spirits
[1:27:07] again coming on their heads
[1:27:08] still same as they started one
[1:27:10] worshiping by beauty by knowledge by
[1:27:12] education by science by ethics
[1:27:14] and the other one by faith of the
[1:27:16] revelation of the word of god both of
[1:27:17] them is standing right in this building
[1:27:20] this morning that's right revelation or
[1:27:22] faith
[1:27:23] he says in his word makes
[1:27:26] no claim of knowledge
[1:27:30] i love this quote right here revelation
[1:27:32] or faith
[1:27:33] in his word makes no claims of knowledge
[1:27:37] the real true christian so it's not
[1:27:39] about knowledge or education
[1:27:41] revelation isn't about knowledge
[1:27:43] education it's about knowing him
[1:27:45] can you say amen but in obedience this
[1:27:47] little
[1:27:48] faith woman that lives by faith
[1:27:51] the bride the person here there here
[1:27:54] of somewhere else some of the church
[1:27:56] some of the nomination whatever it is
[1:27:58] some not
[1:27:58] he says believes the word of god
[1:28:00] obedient waiting
[1:28:02] in love for the promise of the age to be
[1:28:05] confirmed
[1:28:06] she's watching for it she is part of
[1:28:09] that word
[1:28:10] and she's watching for her life
[1:28:14] oh can you raise a hand and say lord
[1:28:16] that's what i'm waiting for
[1:28:18] she who is that bride let's identify her
[1:28:21] she's waiting in love for the promise of
[1:28:23] this age she's watching for it she's
[1:28:25] part of that word
[1:28:26] she's watching for her life to manifest
[1:28:29] that word the body is waiting which is
[1:28:33] the word
[1:28:33] waiting for the life which is the spirit
[1:28:36] to confirm
[1:28:37] or make it alive that's what she's
[1:28:39] waiting
[1:28:40] for no other life will work in her
[1:28:44] she can't come to life any other way yet
[1:28:47] she feels it out there
[1:28:48] she knows it's going to happen then here
[1:28:51] it happens
[1:28:52] then she wakes up god said let there be
[1:28:55] and there comes forth like the first one
[1:28:57] come forth
[1:29:00] so what is that it's a it's a it's a
[1:29:03] bride
[1:29:03] now notice even the scripture speaks in
[1:29:06] matthew 24
[1:29:07] and it talks about these servants wicked
[1:29:10] servants
[1:29:11] who would say the lord delayeth his
[1:29:13] coming you remember that scripture
[1:29:14] really well
[1:29:16] and so we know here that that
[1:29:19] jesus says in matthew 24 verse 44
[1:29:23] he says therefore be also be ye
[1:29:26] also ready i'm trying to mute that for
[1:29:29] in such an
[1:29:29] hour you think not
[1:29:33] the son of man cometh for in an
[1:29:36] hour you think not i think it was my
[1:29:38] dad's sunday was it saying that
[1:29:40] that's when when is the lord cometh when

[1:30:29] waiting for him i'm expecting him my
[1:30:31] heart's
[1:30:32] an expectation for the lord say why

[1:30:58] got to look over here in his
[1:30:59] brother and says sister that could
[1:31:00] happen in five minutes
[1:31:02] just like that at the hour you think not
[1:31:06] are you are you here tonight the bible
[1:31:08] says while the bridegroom tarried this
[1:31:10] is matthew 25
[1:31:11] while the bridegroom tarried
[1:31:15] what are we in now the terry
[1:31:19] while the bridegroom tarried they all
[1:31:22] slumbered
[1:31:23] and slept and so so what was it it was a
[1:31:27] loss of expectation
[1:31:29] that there was a tarry that the
[1:31:31] excitement comes
[1:31:32] the bride's coming the groom's coming
[1:31:34] and there's an excitement but then in
[1:31:35] the terry portion
[1:31:36] when the lord terry is coming then they
[1:31:39] all slumbered and they all
[1:31:41] slept what do you do when you lose your
[1:31:44] spiritual expectation for the coming of
[1:31:45] the lord
[1:31:46] you slumber and you sleep
[1:31:50] peter says it this way uh

[1:32:15] peter speaking he says looking for
[1:32:18] looking for watching looking
[1:32:21] for and hastening
[1:32:24] unto the coming of the day of god
[1:32:28] wherein the heavens being on fire shall
[1:32:30] be dissolved
[1:32:32] and the elements shall melt with fervent
[1:32:35] heat you're waiting for that
[1:32:39] yeah in fact hastening
[1:32:43] looking for hastening to the coming
[1:32:46] of the day where in the heavens being on
[1:32:49] fire shall be dissolved you say do you
[1:32:50] believe in global warming i do it's
[1:32:52] right here in the bible
[1:32:55] the bible will be globally warmed
[1:32:58] but as one man said it won't be because
[1:33:00] your hairspray it won't be because of of
[1:33:02] uh you know something we're putting in
[1:33:04] the environment
[1:33:05] but it'll be because god decides it's
[1:33:07] time
[1:33:08] amen and the element shall the the
[1:33:11] heavens be on fire shall be dissolved
[1:33:12] and the elements shall melt
[1:33:15] with fervent heat paul says in first
[1:33:18] corinthians 1 7 he says we
[1:33:19] wait for the coming of the lord jesus
[1:33:23] christ
[1:33:24] but but what's the world saying maybe
[1:33:26] not by their words
[1:33:27] but by their life their life is saying
[1:33:29] the lord delayeth is coming
[1:33:31] for since the fathers have fallen asleep
[1:33:32] all things remain as they are amen
[1:33:36] that's that's the siren sound of the
[1:33:38] world but there's something another
[1:33:39] voice that we've heard
[1:33:41] that says behold the bridegroom cometh
[1:33:44] prepare yourself what is the voice of
[1:33:47] the bride saying in this age
[1:33:49] even so quickly even so come lord jesus
[1:33:54] what do you read when you read what you
[1:33:56] hear about oh
[1:33:57] you know you yeah we're not going to
[1:33:58] preach on it here by no means
[1:34:00] but some of you who uh who watched that
[1:34:02] wrestling match last night
[1:34:05] that boxing match last night what does
[1:34:08] it do to you brother matt
[1:34:09] it gets something deeper in size even so
[1:34:12] come lord jesus quickly lord jesus
[1:34:15] even so lord come what is the bride the
[1:34:18] spirit
[1:34:19] and the bride say come
[1:34:22] where does that come from from something
[1:34:23] down on the inside of you
[1:34:25] when you look at the chaos in the world
[1:34:27] something says
[1:34:28] come lord jesus even so come lord jesus
[1:34:32] i believe that's the identity that's a
[1:34:35] characteristic of the bride of christ
[1:34:37] she's not looking to stay here she's not
[1:34:39] looking to plant down roots she's
[1:34:41] looking to get out of here
[1:34:47] and he's coming soon we're going to
[1:34:49] close he's coming
[1:34:51] soon jesus is coming soon
[1:34:55] say how do you know it brother matt
[1:34:56] because i could feel the beating down on
[1:34:58] the inside of my soul
[1:34:59] there's something inside of me the word
[1:35:02] only recognizes the word there's a deep
[1:35:04] that calls to the deep
[1:35:05] there's something inside of the bride of
[1:35:07] jesus christ something pulsating
[1:35:09] something yearning in our hearts and yes
[1:35:12] even so
[1:35:13] come quickly lord jesus oh oh
[1:35:16] why do you think you feel the lateness
[1:35:18] of the hour why do you think you feel to
[1:35:19] pull away from the world
[1:35:21] to get rid of the world the vain riches
[1:35:23] of the world to separate yourself unto
[1:35:25] christ
[1:35:26] you didn't put that there god put that
[1:35:29] there
[1:35:30] oh he's not delaying his coming but i
[1:35:32] can hear his footsteps
[1:35:34] at the door i can hear the song soon and
[1:35:37] very soon
[1:35:38] we are going to see the king i can hear
[1:35:41] the song just any day now
[1:35:43] my lord is coming uh he'll be returning
[1:35:46] for you and me
[1:35:47] oh i've been watching and i've been
[1:35:49] waiting just any day
[1:35:51] his face i'll see oh what is the song of
[1:35:54] aegis said
[1:35:55] gladly may we herald the message of his
[1:35:58] blessed appearing
[1:36:00] what what is it it's an expectant bride
[1:36:03] who's in an expectation
[1:36:04] for his coming you think of
[1:36:08] think of of mary magdalene
[1:36:11] and the bible speaks of mary and and and
[1:36:14] and and john maybe we'll turn there john
[1:36:16] chapter 20 you can put it up
[1:36:18] uh verse one i want i want just to catch
[1:36:20] this before we before we close here
[1:36:23] it's just 8 30. so just give me just a
[1:36:25] couple more minutes he says here in john
[1:36:27] 20 verse 1 i want you to notice this
[1:36:31] here the bible says that
[1:36:34] that the first day of the week cometh
[1:36:35] mary magdalene early when it was yet
[1:36:38] dark
[1:36:39] unto the sepulcher and seeth the stone
[1:36:43] taken away from the sepulcher
[1:36:46] now this is a woman who loved jesus who
[1:36:49] was looking for the expectation she had
[1:36:51] an expectation
[1:36:53] for the lord jesus and the bible says
[1:36:56] that now now now this was
[1:36:57] this was uh this was a a who was she
[1:37:00] she's a woman typing what a bride
[1:37:02] typing what an expectation she had a
[1:37:04] fervency
[1:37:05] there was a zeal there was a love there
[1:37:08] was an affection for christ
[1:37:10] and the bible says that that she she
[1:37:14] in in in verse one the the reader the
[1:37:16] first day that we come to mary magdalene
[1:37:17] early
[1:37:18] when it was yet dark so it was sometime
[1:37:21] in the in the early wee
[1:37:22] hours of the morning maybe two or three
[1:37:25] uh
[1:37:25] a.m when it was yet dark even unto and
[1:37:28] he says unto the sepulcher
[1:37:29] and seeth the stone taketh away from the
[1:37:32] sepulchre and so mary comes to the
[1:37:35] to the to the sepulcher early in the
[1:37:38] morning notice where everyone else is
[1:37:42] why doesn't it say that all peter and
[1:37:44] everybody and and all the disciples
[1:37:46] it doesn't say everybody was there at
[1:37:48] the grave at the sepulcher it was one
[1:37:50] woman
[1:37:52] are you seeing this everybody else was
[1:37:54] asleep
[1:37:57] but mary's up early in the morning and
[1:37:59] the bible says she runneth and cometh to
[1:38:01] simon peter
[1:38:02] and to the other disciples and so she
[1:38:05] comes
[1:38:06] uh while everybody else sleeps and the
[1:38:08] bible says she sees the stone rode away
[1:38:10] and the body of jesus is missing and so
[1:38:12] she goes to peter and john
[1:38:14] and it says that she she she uh she
[1:38:17] runneth and cometh the simon peter and
[1:38:19] the other disciple
[1:38:20] whom jesus loved and said unto them they
[1:38:21] have taken away the lord out of the
[1:38:23] sepulchre and we know not
[1:38:25] where they have laid him uh verse 3
[1:38:28] and it says peter therefore went forth
[1:38:30] and that other disciple
[1:38:32] and came to the sepulchre so what do
[1:38:36] they see now he's not there his body's
[1:38:38] gone
[1:38:39] and the bible says they they the the two
[1:38:41] disciples
[1:38:42] come the other discipline came to the
[1:38:43] sepulcher verse four let's just keep
[1:38:45] reading here
[1:38:46] so they ran both together and the other
[1:38:47] disciple did outrun peter
[1:38:49] and came first to the sepulcher verse
[1:38:51] five and he's stooping down
[1:38:53] looking in saw the linen clothes line
[1:38:55] yet when he not
[1:38:56] in verse six then cometh simon peter
[1:38:59] following him
[1:39:00] went into the sepulchre and seeth the
[1:39:02] linen clothes
[1:39:03] lie verse 7 and the napkin that was
[1:39:05] about his head not lying in the linen
[1:39:07] clothes but wrapped together
[1:39:08] in a place by itself then went and also
[1:39:11] that other disciple which came first to
[1:39:13] the sepulcher
[1:39:14] and he saw
[1:39:17] and believed
[1:39:20] what did they do they remembered the
[1:39:22] words of jesus
[1:39:24] notice that they saw the bible says they
[1:39:27] saw and believed what
[1:39:28] mary's words his body's not there
[1:39:33] the bible says here they uh the next the
[1:39:35] next verse
[1:39:36] verse 9 first yet they knew not the
[1:39:38] scripture that he must rise again from
[1:39:40] the dead verse 10
[1:39:42] then the disciples went away again unto
[1:39:44] their home
[1:39:45] they leave who's these people peter
[1:39:49] amen john
[1:39:52] they they seen and believed and that was
[1:39:54] enough we're going home we've seen it
[1:39:56] we've seen it we've seen all we needed
[1:39:57] to see we're going home
[1:40:00] but notice the difference in mary but
[1:40:02] mary stood
[1:40:04] without a decepticon weeping and as she
[1:40:07] wept
[1:40:07] she stooped down and looked into the
[1:40:09] sepulchre what was it
[1:40:11] it was mary was longing mary was
[1:40:13] yearning
[1:40:14] she saw the napkin she saw and believed
[1:40:17] others left and went home
[1:40:18] but the bible says that mary seeing and
[1:40:21] believing
[1:40:22] that the the bible says that the
[1:40:24] disciples went away again unto their
[1:40:25] home
[1:40:26] so so there was there was there was
[1:40:28] something further though there was
[1:40:30] something more
[1:40:31] i want you to catch us here today there
[1:40:33] was something more
[1:40:34] not just like not just like most
[1:40:36] christians uh
[1:40:38] you know who says well i've seen the
[1:40:39] power of god and you know of course i
[1:40:41] believe in god and
[1:40:42] of course i've seen miracles i've seen
[1:40:44] the dead raised him
[1:40:45] and you know i love the lord with all my
[1:40:47] heart but and then they go home
[1:40:49] they believe and they go home but then
[1:40:51] there's a mary who stays at the
[1:40:53] sepulcher
[1:40:54] and says but but i want more than just
[1:40:56] the story
[1:40:57] i want more than just the history i want
[1:40:59] my lord
[1:41:01] i want more than just the evidence i
[1:41:03] want him
[1:41:04] there's a weeping there's a crying
[1:41:06] there's an expectation
[1:41:09] mary didn't want just his word
[1:41:12] she wanted him she wanted him what does
[1:41:16] the bride want she doesn't just
[1:41:18] want his words she wants
[1:41:21] amen can't understand it can't explain
[1:41:25] it
[1:41:26] but i want him
[1:41:30] mary stood without the sepulcher weeping
[1:41:34] oh what did mary realize this
[1:41:37] life is not worth living without him
[1:41:41] what about everything that had happened
[1:41:42] mary it was all good but if he's dead
[1:41:45] it ain't worth living what about all the
[1:41:47] miracles mary he delivered you of seven
[1:41:49] demons mary what about all the things
[1:41:50] god has done in your life

[1:42:09] to live in
[1:42:10] unless i have him what is it it's the
[1:42:13] character of the bride she wants him
[1:42:16] she doesn't want us just the theology or
[1:42:18] seminary or a doctrine or mystery she
[1:42:21] wants him
[1:42:22] uh give me the mysteries but give me the
[1:42:23] person of the mystery give me his
[1:42:25] essence give me his presence

[1:42:32] want
[1:42:32] him she stood she weeped looked into the
[1:42:35] sepulcher and seeing
[1:42:36] seeing two angels and white sitting the
[1:42:38] one at the head
[1:42:39] the other at the feet were the body of
[1:42:41] jesus had lain
[1:42:43] while the other disciples went back home
[1:42:48] while the other disciples were content
[1:42:49] to go home guess what happens angels
[1:42:51] appear to marry
[1:42:52] they appeared to the one who was waiting
[1:42:55] and expecting
[1:42:56] the lord paul says there is laid for me
[1:43:00] a crown of righteousness that the
[1:43:01] righteous judge shall give me and to
[1:43:03] all of them who what
[1:43:06] love is appearing
[1:43:11] do you love the appearing of god
[1:43:15] all those who love his appearing verse
[1:43:19] 14 she turned herself back and saw
[1:43:21] jesus standing and knew not that it was
[1:43:23] jesus jesus said unto her woman why we
[1:43:25] bestow
[1:43:26] whom seeketh thou she supposing him to
[1:43:28] be the gardener saith unto him sir
[1:43:31] if thou have borne him hence tell me
[1:43:33] where thou has laid him
[1:43:35] and i will take him and i will take him
[1:43:38] away
[1:43:39] she wanted him for himself she wanted
[1:43:43] she wanted him for herself
[1:43:46] what is that what is the song to say
[1:43:48] mind mind mind
[1:43:50] jesus is mine oh my mind mine it was
[1:43:53] something personal to mary
[1:43:55] if you've taken him give him to me i'll
[1:43:57] take him if you born him hence tell me
[1:43:59] where that was laid him and i will take
[1:44:01] him away
[1:44:02] jesus in verse 16 says unto her mary she
[1:44:05] turned herself
[1:44:06] and said unto him rabboni which is to
[1:44:08] say master what was it
[1:44:10] the voice that was unrecognizable but
[1:44:12] now he speaks in a different way
[1:44:14] it was the same man speaking but the
[1:44:16] voice was different
[1:44:17] because now mary something in her heart
[1:44:20] can recognize
[1:44:21] this isn't a gardener this is my
[1:44:23] master's voice
[1:44:26] you imagine the joy that flooded mary's
[1:44:29] heart
[1:44:29] when she could hear the words mary
[1:44:34] notice he doesn't call her woman
[1:44:38] but he knew her name and he says
[1:44:41] mary she turned herself and said unto
[1:44:44] him rabboni
[1:44:46] which is the say master
[1:44:50] musicians could you come amen 8 42
[1:44:56] bible says that mary no doubt goes back
[1:45:00] brother matthew could you come back also
[1:45:02] mary comes back
[1:45:03] the bible says goes back jesus said in
[1:45:06] her mary turn herself instead of him
[1:45:08] rabboni
[1:45:08] which is to say master let's all stand
[1:45:10] to our feet here tonight
[1:45:12] and then you can just play something at
[1:45:13] your own choosing stand amen together
[1:45:28] amen let's just bow our heads here as
[1:45:31] you play something
[1:45:34] the character of the bride
[1:45:38] what is it she's an expectation
[1:45:42] she's humble before the lord she's
[1:45:44] waiting she's watching
[1:45:46] oh could you identify here tonight maybe
[1:45:48] about an uplifted hand to the lord and
[1:45:50] say lord
[1:45:51] something within me as i see the world

[1:45:55] look at politics as i look at the
[1:45:57] structure of the government as i look at
[1:45:59] the structure of the the entire world

[1:46:05] so come lord jesus
[1:46:08] even so come lord i want to walk humbly
[1:46:11] before

[1:46:28] this i do know that we shall be like him
[1:46:31] in his very image lord the bride is
[1:46:34] crying out tonight to say
[1:46:35] lord make us break us humble us
