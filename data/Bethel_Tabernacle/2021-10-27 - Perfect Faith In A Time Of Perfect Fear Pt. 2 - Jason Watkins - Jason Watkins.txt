sacrifice to him don't you glad to have you out tonight on a wednesday we're a little thin tonight we've got a number of uh the team out already headed over toward traveler's rest and so just to remind you there'll be no service here this weekend we'll be all there all of our equipment will be there all of our teams will be there so be impossible we don't we don't have enough equipment to split it all up effectively at any rate and so uh we're and the personnel will be over there as well so we will be as far as i know streaming hey mo is that right we will be streaming from there i believe yeah so um you should be able i'll supply make sure it gets put in the church whatsapp um i hope you all check that amen sometimes i put in announcements and a couple days later i'll get a question concerning the announcement i just posted so make sure that you're checking that or you've got a hey man somebody in the home checking it so that's how we look to communicate with you and so it makes me it helps me helps my mind just to know that you're catching um any announcements that i feel need to go out praise the lord all right god bless you we're going to go right back to our text from sunday where we were in second peter chapter 1. and i started a little deeply into it i think this time i will um go a little start a little sooner and uh and then but we won't we won't need to re-read our text in ephesians or or in our text in romans we'll just catch this one here and we'll let you be seated i want to continue on tonight with fear faith fear versus faith i think is how i titled it faith versus fear amen and if you remember that i had in the subtitle that we have we're at a time where it's perfect faith in a time of perfect fear and that is the hour that you have arrived at friends and i you know and i i just want to say that the world is falling apart and i can't stop that i'm just here to tell you right now if you're looking for brother jason or the ministry or somehow the word in this hour to stop the world from disintegrating it's not going to happen see and you have to remember that that that jesus never sent the gospel to save the world because you know the very same jesus who sent us into the world go ye into all the world and preach the gospel also prophesied that the world is going to come apart and go read matthew 24. so he he he never imagined uh you know like like does the roman church um the catholic church imagines that they because of their influence and power they can actually bring the millennium to the world and that's that's not going to happen that's a pipe dream the only there there as brother branham said there will be no peace till jesus comes and establishes his kingdom right here on the earth amen and so the gospel did not come to save the world the gospel came to save god's children out of the world amen and uh and and and and as a beautiful wonderful um uh uh what we would call an effect of that uh christ died while he was here he died for the sins of the whole world so that whosoever will can come and believe and be saved amen so god and his benevolence didn't have to do it that way he didn't have to save anybody but he wouldn't lose his children and he could have just come and just said it's just my kids and that's it but he actually gives a legitimate chance to all mankind to believe on the word and save himself from this untoward generation most won't that's the sad reality um but all we can do is preach the gospel i'm just glad for this i'm glad i'm a believer and i'm glad you're a believer and i'm glad that eagle screamed and i heard it amen come out of babylon and i heard it and i said okay i'll come out hallelujah i sure enjoyed that song brother steve amen appreciate that so much praise the lord what a set of pipes amen for a second peter chapter one and we're gonna um we're gonna start this time we're gonna start um you know i think i will uh oh i'm not gonna find my verse did i say first peter i meant second peter i'm sorry second peter ii peter here we go okay verse chapter one verse one and we'll kind of skip along i'm not going to read it in its entirety but first of all i want you to understand clearly because i made this statement to you sunday now i'm about to prove it to you i'm going to let you read it yourself you're going to see very clearly who peter's preaching to who these statements he's about to make you're going to see here who he's making them to all right simon peter a servant and an apostle of jesus christ to them that have obtained like precious faith with us through the righteousness of god and our savior jesus christ now is there any doubt who he's talking to all right grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of our of our god and of jesus our lord now watch according as his divine power might someday give it to us that how it reads according as his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory so you you probably can read that and understand why faith then comes by hearing the word see because it comes through this knowledge of god and god uses his word and the foolishness of preaching to to describe and to get peoples to understand what god is like now the holy spirit still has to make it real to you for it to have a changing effect on you but you can understand the methodology here that god uses his word and your faith in his word is what catches his attention that's when that's when you have access to every promise and i want you to notice according as his divine power hath given it's already in the past anything that you're going to want from god and pray and believe you receive it you're going to have to put it in the past tense amen if a farmer wants to grow a crop the sowing of seed has to be in the past he can wish all day wish upon a star for a crop but unless he has in the past put the seed in the ground no crops coming amen so if you want to reap the promises of god take them in your mind in your heart in your confession and put it in the past and say he has already done it i'm already healed i'm already delivered i already have victory say well it doesn't your symptoms and brother ram said symptoms don't have one thing to do with the promise that's zero to do with the promise see all right as far as god is concerned it's already done if he can just get you to confess it that way verse four whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by these you might be partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust and besides this now he's clearly established he's talking to people who are born again of the spirit of god just like he was all right and now he's going to say listen you don't have to live below your privileges and i'm going to say well peter great tell me how i can live an overcomer's life here he goes all right give all diligence add to your faith virtue and divert your knowledge and he goes down this long list of seven characteristics of the nature of god and remember they're in the gene of god in you already that's that's how you got them you didn't win a lottery i didn't give you a seat of god the gospel is a seed jesus called it that but when it comes to a gene of god that comes from god from the eternities and you are always that and that's why brother branham would say everything you have needed for a rapture is in you now it's in the past tense it's already i'm going in the rapture i'm going in the rapture because i'm part of the rapture amen see and so so now but but what about the here and now what about life in real time i want to be an overcomer i want to partake of these precious promises and i don't want to have to wait to heaven i want a part of the divine nature right now peter says glad to know that you're at the right place how do i do it peter all right now you're going to start adding you're going to start building it up you're going to start increasing it and and there's ways to go about that see so so that's why when we come then to verse 8 verse 8 for if these things be in you and abound here's what they do they don't allow you to do it they make you that ye shall neither be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our lord jesus christ but he that lacketh these things not doesn't mean you don't have them it means that they're they're not built up you're a little weakling you're a king's child living like a pauper living well below your privileges because you haven't taken the necessary steps for spiritual strength it's not rocket science it's real easy to do see you coming here to service tonight to be in the atmosphere of the holy spirit just be around all these people who are bringing their little leaks of fire hear the word of god preached do you know do you know the preaching of the gospel cast out devils did you know singing cast out devils do you know that brother kenny's main job up here is to bind and drive back evil spirits it's not to entertain you it's not to entertain you it's not to hear hear himself sing he's up here under an anointing of god with the gift of god to do what bind the enemy driving from the people so that when the word comes forth you're ready to go amen so this is why we put our all into it this is why we're all in this together when i'm preaching and you're listening we're in this thing together brother kenny brother anthony brother matt brother matt whoever's leading brother brad whoever is leading singing we're all in this together amen for if these things be in you and abound they make you that ye shall neither be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our lord jesus christ but he that lacketh these things blind cannot see it far off and hath forgotten that he was purged from his old sins wherefore the rather brother in other words instead of that come on don't be like that give diligence to make your calling and election sure it's amazing how often we give diligence to other things other than that we give all kinds of diligence to entertainment we very diligently keep up with our teams we very diligently keep up with our social media amen brother charles i see you shaking your head no thank you god bless you anyway but y'all's like not me praise the lord amen but what about giving diligence to make your calling and election strong and sure and rugged see so so he says for so and entrance verse 11 shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our lord and savior jesus christ wherefore i will not be negligent friends i i don't care how many how tired you get of hearing me say these kinds of things i will not be negligent amen i will not i refuse to be negligent to put you always in remembrance of these things though you know them i know you know them you know you know them you know i know that you know that you know them but i am still going to bring them into your remembrance why are you going to do that and so that you can be established in the present truth now present truth doesn't mean the truth you heard sunday it's the truth you need today because every day is getting darker every day is getting worse and you need to be established daily i die daily paul said why to establish myself in the present truth it's great what god did for me months ago but i need him i need him now i need him right now amen may the lord add blessings to his word god bless you can be seated so now let's uh have my powerpoint up guys and we're just going to go studiously through this tonight we're not going to keep you long and um we've had a very exhausting last several days my own body and my mind a man weary and uh but boy we have we had a good time wow sunday was epic we're going to remember that service for a while and then we were able to have such wonderful fellowship with brother andrew and all of his family and the rehearsal and then the wedding and boy we had a good time at that yesterday and and uh didn't get home till dark 30 and amen so we're feeling it a little bit physically and mentally but boy i'm also feeling this amen amen so i'm sure happy to have somebody out tonight to preach to so we have been talking a lot on sunday we showed you how that you know we we we have human weaknesses and anybody that's gonna say i don't have them well well i'm glad you're at church because liars need to be at church amen uh we've all got our ups and downs amen we've all we're all men and women of like passions we have our ups and downs brother ramsay that's what that means elijah himself was a man of like passions brother ram said that many had his ups and downs but i'm you know i love it how that brother branham goes into detail if you go back and you listen to his hebrews series i think in part two he preached like seven parts of that and i think in part two or chapter two however they they label that there and brother branham talks about that and he just you know in his in his homespun down-to-earth way it's not no fancy dialogue it's not a fancy monologue he's not using big greek words he just starts talking about our human weaknesses and said you know sometimes you make mistakes and he said sometimes you do things that's wrong and he said but just remember he said jesus is there to constantly intercede for you said because he loves you he loves you and he's not going to lose you and he and he knows the weaknesses that we suffered i i i sit back and i say lord i'm so glad that you understand my weaknesses and you love me i have a prophet saying you love me and he says even if you do wrong he said you just repent said he'll forgive you every time every time he'll just keep forgiving you every time brother brahma said because he loved you that's why he did it he loved you and so we we do have as paul said fightings without and fears within and paul himself being 14 days uh stranded at sea and paul even said you know we despaired of life itself i mean paul almost gave up and ready to die so so let's give ourselves a little bit of a break we are humans and we do have natural fears and natural anxieties but you know these natural human anxieties and fears notwithstanding we showed you last sunday that fear to the level where it becomes unbelief that that that that is the absolute opposite of perfect faith and in fact is perfect faith and perfect fear are mutually exclusive terms it's impossible for them to be both true at the same time in a single person because brother branham said now you have 10 fleshly senses right you have 10 senses of your spirit your conscience reason affection and so forth but he said in the soul that only has one channel it's either faith or doubt either it's converted or it's not either it's light or it's dark amen so so so we find then that that the when when we look at how that god created the world with his word and we were dealing with with that last sunday how that you know just just by his spoken word alone with no one to help him and he didn't need any help he just spoke and created all the galaxies and all the worlds and worlds of worlds and he literally put space into an ex into an into an uh ever unfolding ever increasing and and science now recognizes that they said we can't find the borders of the of the of of space because we actually believe it's probably constantly expanding to which i've always said that's good because the bible speaking of the kingdom of christ says of the increase of his kingdom there shall be no end and so i just said an ever-increasing kingdom is going to need an ever-increasing universe oh my friends think about what you're a part of here tonight and so we we we put it to you that you know how would we how would we allow ourselves ever to get into a position yet we do as humans that's why we have to come to church and hear the preaching that's why judgment begins at the house of god i'd love to come out here and and and preach you a disney world sermon i'd love to just have a permanent smile put on my face and and and have a big glowing you know silver globe turning in the background and an auditorium with 30 40 000 people and just tell you that jesus loves you so be a good neighbor but i'm sorry judgment begins at the house of the lord and but but just just understand that before i ever come here and get onto you i'm sitting in an office and he's getting on to me amen we're all in this thing together aren't you glad amen and so we we begin to look at how that would we ever want to allow weights that hinder us and that's why paul would say come on lay aside those weights that that that's so easily beset you they so easily slow you down i mean listen friends i spent a life working where i where i climbed ladders and you know and you get you get roofers that climb ladders and painters climb ladders and construction men and there's one thing to climbing a ladder with no tools and there's a whole other thing to climbing it with tools on then there's a whole nother thing to climbing it with tools and supplies on your shoulder i'm here to tell you something friends you'd much rather just climb it without all that stuff lay aside the weights that so easily beset you and climb into the upper atmosphere see and so how would we not want to do that lay aside those things that hinder us from this access that we have and the results that we are entitled to say what results precious promises we read them peter says by these that's the part of the divine nature precious promises that by these you may be a partaker of the divine nature say what's the advantage of having the divine nature the divine nature created everything the divine nature is all powerful the divine nature can't be defeated the divine nature can't be refused the divine nature has all authority going to tell you something friends i i like i like going through life knowing that whatever i ask in the name of the lord jesus christ and don't doubt it in my heart i shall have what i've asked for see and so we talked about how that redeeming the time is so very important we prove to you i think pretty conclusively how important it was it's more valuable than money it was more valuable than anything and so when we began to look at that we came to this question all right and so in faith versus fear and perfect faith in a time of perfect fear and then i ran through these scriptures showing that we don't need to read it all again you can go back sunday and catch it but i i want to come to this quote here in obama and gilead but when the one of the one of the last things that we left you with last weekend was how that we we begin to ask you the question that what real uh value you know what real eternal good say well i'm going to redeem the time and we were careful to show you that we're not just talking about going to taking a time management course i'm going to operate more efficiently i'm going to officially i'm going to take a time management course i'm going to take a leadership skill class well those things are awesome i'd recommend every ever everybody take those i'd recommend every young man for sure find and take those classes because they they teach tremendous leadership skills time management operating very efficiently they're awesome i i think it should be part of standard education and and to a degree it is but i think that that one of the things we're lacking in this day is efficiency yeah you know everybody's just playing the whole world just playing and and you you they're even struggling now because they can't get anybody back working and and you men here business owners understand that you can't even find people who are even willing to work at any amount of money they'd rather just they'd rather just do nothing and so that they asked brother branham you know said should we continue to work our jobs and brother braham's like good sure only he said only a christian will really work see because you work as unto the lord not preaching on that tonight let me get off of it so so but but when we when we thought about you know real eternal good what what real and eternal good would it do you to redeem your time just by time management classes or leadership courses because none of those have an eternal value they have no eternal good they could help you here in life but what real eternal value do they have that's not the kind of redeeming the time that paul that peter and paul and john and james and all the apostles were constantly preaching on because we realized that to really redeem the time and this is what we really what we're trying to prove to you over the weekend that that peter is showing you how to redeem the time paul was showing he said put on the whole armor of god pray always without ceasing this is how you redeem the time add to your faith virtue add to virtual knowledge add to these things this is how you redeem the time see that's where you get the real there is no better way than god's way for realizing in your life the many rewards that he has promised to the overcomer now brother brennan makes this statement in obama and gilead the one thing that we have to do excuse me the one thing that we have to move up to now is a supreme faith to what we have had now this goes all the way back to the azusa revival he's saying everything that we've had under luther wesley even the azusa street revivalist we're going to have to go further and he's saying this in 59 he said listen he already knew even before the seals were open he already knew where we got to go further brother brannon would say in another quote the church can't go in the rapture in its current condition and the and the real rub is it can't get any better amen you're talking about a gordian knot you're talking about a conundrum you're talking about no way out it can't go like it is and it can't improve okay so how do i get there right you can't well how do i improve you can't right why not because they're they're refusing the word they're rejecting christ they're eventually going to completely put him out of the church and that's when the message is going to come and god's going to loose the seals and send forth the prophet with the spirit of elijah and call you out of that doomed system doomed it's doomed there's no way you can't even fix it it can't even be redeemed anymore it's past redemption those systems of man are done finished god will not operate in them any longer that that's what happened that's what paul was trying to point out to the jews they said well good grief we've had sixteen hundred years and you're telling us it's over and paul said yep but we've been bringing them and moses told us and we've been bringing these my my daddy his daddy his daddy his daddy his daddy his daddy is daddy you're telling me that now when i bring my lamb god's not even going to accept it that's what i'm telling you because the lamb of god has come that time has passed that window is closed he will not honor that anymore you're going to have to come and receive the holy ghost so once the cry of the message went out come out of her my people there was no option to stay in her no way not not not and be redeemed see the unwise virgin are safe from destruction but they finally come to their senses in the tribulation and and actually refuse to take the mark of the beast and that's god's grace to them because they're truly sanctified people so brother branham says here he says now the one thing that we have to move up to now is a supreme faith to what we have had i'm really going to watch my time tonight i'm not going to not going to wear you out so just stay right with me you cannot have that faith until you know perfectly what you're doing just say well i'm going home i'm going out and start the car that's all an act of faith and you're sitting here subconsciously and i'd say hey i hear it raining outside well somebody go out here and crank up your car and drive it up close the door so sister davey don't have to get wet she can get in your car real quick and everybody'd volunteer and you wouldn't give a thought that i can't go out there and crank my car because it's unconscious to you you've done it so many times say that that's that's faith yeah brother brahman said he's actually going to show you watch this he says i'm going to start my car that's all i can pay tomorrow i will meet you in a certain place that's all an act of faith because you've just done it so much because it's a regular routine with you well that's the way the things of god are after you have trusted him and watched him do so many things till it becomes just like a regular routine and that's the condition i think the church will be in just before the coming of the lord so the rapture will just go right on that way it'll just be a regular routine of following the scriptures and the plans of god amen now he's not saying you're christianity become ho-hum not saying it just be routine it's not saying you'll just take god for granted what he's saying is that you'll develop a systematic habitual lifestyle of following the scriptures for the plans of god to work in your life those are the people who are going in the rapture and it'll just be as routine as i'm gonna go start my car real quick see that's exactly what god and a prophet caught it even years before it began to fully manifest itself he caught it that it that's what it would take and that that's what it would be later some years later he's going to repreach this thought in the sermon called perfect faith and he's going to go back and he's going to say it again just in a different way he's going to say now you've had a faith he said but i'm trying to get you now to understand perfect faith amen see so so there is a faith that we are aiming at and and as i said sunday this this is superior uh i mean there are a number of of uh human because there is a human faith and it's good it's a good thing it's important well i think i think sunday we mentioned to you the right mental attitude remember that one the right mental attitude toward any promise of god we'll bring it to pass see eventually there's another one called brother brown called it the uh the adopt a baby that's what he could play with it's called the adopt a baby faith he talked about sisters who couldn't have children and and and it became an anxiety and became an anxiousness to them and as they and they wanted him more and more and more and he said the the harder they tried the further away from it they got because they were trying people would come up into the into the prayer line and brother bran will say now you're trying real hard to believe he said but you're actually hindering yourself see because you're you're trying to make yourself believe it he said don't do that just believe it so what's the difference how do i do it he said just accept it and walk on thank god for it and just go on and he said god will let you get well and you'll see it it'll unfold in your life the your your your faith will materialize and it'll catch up to you and overtake you and the next thing you know you're healed next thing you're delivered next thing you know you're out of a jam next thing you know this that and that and and how many have can witness that's how god has operated many times he don't always use miracles if he always use miracles they wouldn't be miracles see so this is a walk of faith this is this is where god i know this is practical tonight but i think it's valuable to us and and and and this this takes some effort this takes some zeal this takes some diligence yeah you know be diligent to make your calling and elections sure add to your faith come on get with it don't let these things if these are in you and super abounding they make you perfect you'll never even fall how about that one for a friend's benefit see so and so brother brandon said she's trying to have a baby he said so a lot of times if she'll just go adopt a baby then that'll flip a switch in her psyche and now that that love has got an outlet and then she won't be struggling to have a baby because she's got one and he said then she'll get pregnant see and and that's that's barring some physical reason why she can't be but but brother branham was just saying he's not saying that was a foolproof way but that is a way that it can work he'd seen it work many times i've i've seen that happen many times but what we're talking about tonight is something superior to the right mental attitude it's something superior to the adopt-a-baby strategy because in those you're you're having to work hard to get faith to work but you have to understand the third poll is him working it through you as a surrendered vessel that's the difference one is a mental gymnastic one is a human effort you're you're having to work to get faith to work but a real perfect faith isn't about that perfect faith is christ has come in this age and he said i've got it i'm ready to give it to you i'll operate it through you what do i need to do lord just surrender just get your life out of my way and i will live through you and i will bring the word to pass in your life that whatsoever you say will come to pass because you've decluttered your mind you've decluttered your heart you've made changes maybe you even made career changes maybe you even made geographical changes you did whatever it took to get you out of the picture amen and you walked in the ways of god's word and then then it's not you needing to do anything it's just you surrendering every day and you're always in this state of ready usableness for god that he can just wouldn't it be lovely for god to know that when he needs something done somewhere in beaufort county he doesn't have to kind of go um i need somebody uh wow gabriel you got any ideas i mean good grief all those believers in bethlehem got a single one wouldn't it be great if somebody could say if an angel could say lord there's a certain need and lord just say yeah this just said luther he can do it oh sure yeah oh oh just just send just send gene she'll do it yeah no worries you want a woman sure woman can do it as good as a man she can believe me just as much as the man can you you sure you know this is all it'll take lord you reckon you reckon i i better send aaron with luther and a pretty big guy and luther can handle himself but he might need some help no we're going to help you're going to sit there and by himself it wouldn't matter wouldn't that be amazing if we had if god knew that every last one of us say oh there's a there's a really bad spirit in that school i need a i need a teenager full of the holy ghost oh i can tell you right now just run down there and get a hold of this one they'll handle that for me amen you say that's kind of nonsense that's not nonsense that's what god is trying to get us to that's what the third poll is all about it's god living in skin in real time right here at the end time see that's where the power of creation lays that's where the power of the spoken word operates you see the the struggle you know to receiving the holy ghost new birth it's a shame that that is because of and i don't say it's by any means on purpose but over the years i saw that preached in such a way that it literally caused young people to struggle over getting the holy ghost and it was never ever to be struggled with the the listen friends if you understand it this way the struggle to receive the holy ghost all right um you the the struggle is not the in the ceiling getting the seal the struggle is in surrender the seal is easy the holy ghost gets his promise he'll absolutely give it to you immediately you don't have to wait 10 days or 10 minutes you don't have to wait any time at all brother ernie before he passed away he was sharing a quote with me last time he was here and he was talking about how that brother branham was in a and a prayer line and he was talking to a a man and had come to a situation he said you spent six years trying to accomplish this in your life he said when you didn't need to spend more than six minutes he said you didn't even need to spend more than six seconds because it was a promise of god that you should have had immediately by disbelieving it and accepting it so but you kept struggling with it remember the the the struggle is not getting sealed the struggle is in the surrender see that's where the struggle is even and then even after the new birth by the holy ghost baptism then there begins the daily struggle of overcoming see and so so when it comes to operating overcoming power your struggle is not in the promise of god's word your struggle is in surrender yes amen see your struggle is getting it your struggle is to accept god's way of reaching it overcoming power is not hard to achieve if you're willing to go god's way to get it say well pray tell god's way i read it to you in a text yeah amen add to your faith virtue add divert your knowledge add these things add these things put on the whole armor of god pray always pray without ceasing gather yourselves together the more so as you see the day approaching amen these are practical nuts and bolts way that we are able to uh that we're able to get ourselves out of the way see and so ii peter 1 and ephesians 6 you just remember you heard brother jason say this those are the ways ii peter chapter 1 and ephesians 6 are the instruction manuals to surrendering to getting yourself out of the way and getting yourself out of the way is the secret to breaking into overcoming power yeah yeah see it's what gives you the strength to surrender because sometimes people are just too strong they're too prideful see and so you know knowing this then then we come back to that question that i i hope penetrated you sunday and if if you didn't hear it you weren't paying attention maybe you got distracted i'm going to ask it again now that you know this method now that i have shown you in the scripture then then could you continue would any of us continue to not prioritize the redeeming of your time to god would you leave a service sunday and leave the service tonight or maybe you're at home hearing the stream and you're not going to make effect any changes or adjustments to your schedule whatever whatsoever see redeeming your time by spending time in prayer redeeming your time by spending time with this living god in worship and in thanksgiving this very being who created all things by his word time in fellowship i hope that's just blows your mind as much as it does mine the opportunities that are right at your fingertips to spend time to have fellowship with the same being that brings with him the same word of power and and creation that he can speak it into your life and you can be a champion for the lord in the last days amen we find a principle in the book of daniel give me that caleb uh daniel chapter 10. i wasn't going to have you turn to it but i think i will just read it familiarize you with it daniel chapter 10 and we'll catch verses 11 to 13. daniel now has been praying for 23 days and we find then that he said unto me the angel gabriel says to me oh daniel a man greatly beloved understand the words that i speak unto thee and stand upright for unto thee am i now sent and when he had spoken this word unto me i stood trembling then said he unto me fear not daniel for from the first day that thou didst set thine heart to understand and to chasten thyself before god thy words were heard and i am come for thy words but the prince of the kingdom of persia withstood me one in 20 days but lo michael one of the chief princes came to help me and i remained there and and with the kings of persia so now this angel goes on to say we don't need to read it you can take that down caleb this angel goes on to tell him now here is what god's answer is and now when i leave here i got to go back and fight some more see and now sometimes we get so afraid of a fight we don't mind praying lord send me an angel and the aim's going to fight but we don't want to fight angel comes said you know he's beat up and bruised up and bleeding say man what happened to you i had to bring an answer to you what are you going to do with it oh i don't know i'll think about it you mean you sent me you sent me through all of this struggle just so you can think about it you wanted god's you wanted god's opinion so you could think about it my so we find this principle that we have to press through many times this upper resistance that we see typed out in the book of daniel because in the spiritual listen friends in the spiritual understand this and the spiritual the prince of the power of the air which is what the bible calls him in the new testament prince of the power of the air which is satan he he literally is the prince of the power of the air between the son jesus christ the lie who's the light of the world amen and the children of god and so the this is when we see it represented here in daniel how that when he went down in prayer and then finally gabriel says to him hey man you know three weeks ago when you started fasting and and and finally he said gabriel common and brought him brought me my answer the first day you consecrated yourself god heard it the first day that god heard it he told me go down there and give that man wisdom but the prince of persia withstood me and finally michael came and helped me but i'm here to give you this wisdom so so a lot of times friends now that was that wasn't even nothing compared to laodicea so you ever wonder why you sometimes get down to pray and it just seems like you it's so dry you don't even want to yeah so let me tell you something be willing to work a little bit be willing to get up early while it's still quiet be willing to get to yourself be willing to do the old-fashioned thing get your prayer closet spend some time sit quietly sing some songs you've got to break through those atmospheres if you can visualize that in your mind that has helped me more than anything in my prayer life that has ever helped me singularly is that i remember that i've got to press my way up through these atmospheres that are trying to stop me trying to distract me trying to fill my mind with all the thoughts of the day that i can get to later this is god's time i'm going to spend time with the lord i'm going to close out the world amen i'm going to do that every day of my life see and in there that's when i find his word alone can help me amen this is why this is exactly why that the bible shows us that it requires the effectual fervent prayer of even a righteous man to avail much amen think about that now it takes the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man to avail much because this is the age that we live in this is exactly why it takes that see and so his word alone needing no help needing no other help i'm here to tell you is able to do in you and to you and for you every promise that he's ever made i'm preaching and teaching on you tonight on perfect faith i'm letting you understand friends that brother branham took all of the movement of christ in seven contiguous church ages they weren't just con continuous they were they were continue contiguous they all came up they even overlapped they didn't just butt up against one another they actually overlapped and and brother branham takes in all 2 000 years of the operation of faith and he comes to the last day and he said now listen and this last day we're going to have to have something more than those ages had we're going to have to go all the way back to what saint paul had before the church began to fall away when they had the abstract when they had the token when they had the jubilee when they had the fullness of the word when the when the when the word was made flesh in a mini-membered body of christ of believers when even it was so much that even peter's shadow would heal people and and brother branham is saying listen you're not going to be able to survive with the great with the faith grandma had you're not going to be able to survive with the with the faith that that the ages produced it was great it was wonderful those movements were great and founded by great men followed by great people but the hour has gotten so dark you're gonna have to move into a perfect faith say perfect faith let me go back and let me can i change perfect faith to this original faith the original faith that's what they had they had the original perfect jubilee the original perfect abstract title deed they were the church of the lord jesus christ amen i i got a sermon i've been working on one of those four or five i told you been cooking in my mind since we started halting services and that gift don't turn off and i want to take a number of services on what is the church what is the church see and we want to take a real close look at that because there's so many privileges there that a lot of times you might have things that god is god is laying treasures all around you and and you don't even notice them and and the holy spirit is just saying just pick one just pick two pick three pick them all and you don't even pick one because you don't know they're there see what is the true church what do we have access to i can tell you that everything of laodicea is designed to keep you from understanding that see and so his word alone can do this but there has to be some fervency because laodicea is geared to exhaust fervency in you amen it's geared to that it's geared to exhaust your fervency see and so you know tonight if i could accomplish anything as i just wind it up for tonight and i'm not still not anywhere close to finishing but i want you to think about this heavenly vault of treasure that you are offered access to you've been given the key to unlock a vault and this vault is filled with eternal life the other day i got to thinking about that and i thought wow have i have i ever just like stepped back and went whoa i have eternal life i have eternal life i have a term i have eternal life i have eternal life i have eternal life guess what i have eternal life did you know i have eternal life did you know i can never die do you really stop and think about what that means to us and to say to yourself i have eternal life when i when i kept saying that to myself i said nothing else even matters nothing else even matters troubles may come but i have eternal life oh hallelujah trials every kind of sickness every kind of trouble but i have eternal life oh sickness of every sort trials of every sort distresses of every sort may descend upon me but i have eternal life i might suffer earthly loss of unimaginable loss but it doesn't matter i have eternal life i win no matter what no matter what no matter what i have eternal life think about that friends when the enemy comes when trials come sickness comes loss comes distress comes troubles come just just back up and go i have eternal life what a privilege you know it's it's hard for mankind and i get it because mankind has had a you know his histories have went back thousands of years and his 6 000 years of histories have really almost made it impossible for him to imagine that somehow it's just coming to an abrupt end but it is because the the tendency is oh it'll just keep going why why do you think that well it always has it always will if something always has you'd tend to think it always will say well well what what about the end of your life what's next well i don't know but i know that you know i'm doing this for my children and children's children children because everybody has this and that's normal that's perfectly nothing wrong with thinking that because that's true it has went hundreds and then a thousand and then thousands and millennia and multiple millennials multiple times millennia and worst and mankind is still here and six thousand years of his histories has made it him almost in impossible for him to perceive that it's all just temporary and has to end it must end and that's what he's missing because the principle is remember the the principle is that whatever is not eternal must end amen it has to end that's the principle and people say yeah but the odds are and i get it the odds are that it'll just it'll go another 6 000 years but i'm here to tell you odds against a bible principle are no match i don't care what the odds are i don't care if you have failed at every spiritual test in your life if you've got a gene of god you're going in a rapture and there's nothing you can do to stop it the devil cannot defeat you even if it looks like it even if you go down and defeat your rise in victory because there is no defeat for god's family there is there now therefore no condemnation to them which are in christ we have the victory assured it's that's not that's never been my issue my whole issue tonight from sunday and tonight is i want to i want to have a fervent life i want to operate these divine principles i want to operate these these promises i want to see god alive in my life i want to make my life count i want to redeem my time while i'm here because it's limited see odds odds nothing i don't care about odds odds against the principle are no match for god's principle and that and that it's hard for man to understand that everything that's happened in all of his thousands of years of history is combined has all been god in perfect control with his plan and his purposes and his destinies and that's hard for people to get their mind around and the and the prophecy the reality is that at the end of the last new testament church age all the histories come to an abrupt end they finish they the earth waxes old the bible says and it's ready to be reborn into a millennium you know it i lucifer don't like to hear it and that's why i love saying it from the day he was created he was not an expression of god because then he'd be eternal he was created by god like hell was created for the devil and his angels not eternal so my brother said there's no eternal hell can't be because it was created it had a start had a start date and it has an expiration date known of god known of god hell has an expiration date on the calendar and every 24 hours it's taking 24 hours closer to it and lucifer sin everything unbelief all has an expiration date amen the devil comes around trying to threaten me brother eddie used to always it's so so funny when he him and sister jean lived in florida before they moved up here i think we were here what mom three years before y'all finally come in two or three years brother dad used to call me up and we all we had all been in north carolina so we knew beaufort had better weather than north carolina that's why we left there because you know five months of wintry gray skies and rain and trying to work in the mud but dad kept going south he ended up all the way in florida which had even better weather than here and so he would call me up and he'd go how's the weather never fails first thing i pick up the phone dad hey how's the weather uh well we're doing okay dad well we're doing better yeah okay okay you know i get to where i the phone ring and i'd pick it up and i'd go your weather's better than mine right yeah so i finally one day that went on i finally figured out a way to break him he he called me and he lived right in orlando you know and and uh he called me up and he said how's the weather i said pretty good how's the traffic oh well it's you know it's no no don't give me that old well it's when it takes an hour to go one city block been there done that got the t-shirt you get out in rush hour traffic that's not exaggeration go one block an hour in downtown orlando during rush hour so he you know he quit seeing it for a while and finally he went back to it called me up how's the weather i said not bad how's the crime [Laughter] he quit asking me that question i don't think he ever asked me anymore after that you know sometimes when the devil comes at me i enjoy the thought you know when he just you know what about this and what about this and i'll say uh what's that expiration date on you buddy let me see oh at the end of the seventh age at the end of laodicea okay oh just put it back on him next time friends if he comes it's your way tomorrow say uh hey what about what's that expiration date again let me hear what was that i'm sorry what was that you're running your mouth a minute ago now what was that what's that expiration date stand up with me friends i'm going to stop right there got a couple prayer requests we're going to go to amen have the musicians return brother kenny if you come on back up and amen and boy i'd love to have you sing that song again brother kenny that was so beautiful that's a great song to go to prayer on amen so on my um i'm just going to look right right fast but we want to continue to remember brother stephen buckles is in need he he's getting it's kind of a hodgepodge the last reports i got was that his fever was spiking but also his oxygen was up and they were able to turn it down from a hundred percent high flow down to ninety percent that'll sound like a lot but that's that's an improvement see we only need a little pebble to roll down off the mountain to start believing for it all right see and so so let's believe for brother stephen buckles there with coven in the hospital very desperate situation it it could still go in any direction so we're just praying his wife was really desperately needing all the prayers of the saints so we want to continue to remember him and sunday when i mentioned brother anthony's mom i forgot to mention brother george also her his dad also who's older than his mom also has coveted and his brother charles and he's he's doing the worst as far as i
