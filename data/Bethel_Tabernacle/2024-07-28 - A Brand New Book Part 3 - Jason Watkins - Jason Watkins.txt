hard to get out the door and get her here on time she said he's going to be taking the next part I want to be there amen so amen i' really really appreciating it brother Jason and I having a little talk in the back room afterwards it's so thrilling to know what the the treasures that lie in the word of God brother brandham said one day he was in his prayer study he said he he got up and he was walking around his chair he laid his chair his Bible down on his chair and he was walking around at praying and he said as I walked by he said I looked down and he said I thought my goodness he said in that book are the are the is eternal life eternal life for whoever would accept it and that grand my praise the Lord Revelation chap 22 we're only going to read one verse in verse six we'll let you be seated and then we'll continue reading after you are seated hey let me make a quick announcement concerning next Sunday um there's been a little kind of a backdoor thing going on that no one knew about very few people knew about it and uh there's only been two uh people who have actually seen the finished product that's brother Bradley Campbell and I and uh brother Bradley came to me some months ago with one of the best ideas I've heard for fundraising for you know for any kind of a project whether it's church building or missions or anything like that it's just a generally a great idea super simple in its concept but I thought my goodness that that is profound and and then he had a second idea and I thought that the second idea was equal to the first idea idea and so we've been preparing um a surprise for you as an assembly and you're not going to get to see it till next Sunday so make your plans to be here amen and so we're going to take next Sunday and uh get with all of the team members and get all of the information thoroughly uh collated and give you a a thorough in-depth update talk about what we're doing talk about what's going on talk about the finances of it amen and so we'll uh we'll incorporate it all into the ministry of the word because that's the main reason we come to church amen but that'll be next Sunday the Lord willing and um as I said if the I've said if the Rapture comes we don't need to worry about it but otherwise we'll be here next Sunday to bring you up to speed on that Revelation chapter 22 and verse six and he said unto me these sayings are faithful and true this was actually he said to me these sayings are faithful and true and the Lord God of the Holy prophets sent his Angel to show unto his servants the things which must shortly be done amen let's pray Master we thank you for your presence here today we thank you for this audience of people who have come out to hear your word for those Lord streaming across the airwaves pray your blessing on them Lord I think about not only your ministry team members uh deployed ministering your gospel but there's other family other whole families Lord on vacation I think of Jonathan and Martha their children and Chris and Katie along and brother Tony and sister Amber and the different ones Lord who who are that I know of who are away today I pray your great blessing would be upon them as well and I'm sure there perhaps are other Lord may you grant your great grace upon their lives in Jesus name amen God bless you friends you can be seated Amen brother Mark Let's uh pick up from verse seven today we are continuing in our third installment brother Gideon told me today he winked at me he Saidi he said I'm predicting nine Parts I'm like get in I don't think so but I've said that before I've been mistaken a couple times in my life so so verse seven behold I come quickly blessed is he that keepeth the sayings of the prophecy of this book and I John saw these things and heard them and when I had heard and seen I fell down to worship before the feet of the Angel which showed me these things then saith he unto me see thou do it not for I am thy fellow servant and of thy Brethren the prophets and of them which keep the sayings of this book um keep the sayings of this book for the time is at hand he that is just is unjust let him be he that is unjust let him be unjust still and he which is filthy let him be filthy still and he that is righteous let him be righteous still still and he that is Holy let him be holy still and behold I come quickly and my reward is with me to give every man according as his work shall be I am Alpha and Omega the beginning and the end the first and the last blessed are they that do his Commandments that they may have right to the tree of life and may enter in through the gates into the city for without are dogs and Sorcerers and whoremongers and murderers and idolators and whosoever loveth and maketh a lie could you imagine loving a lie I Jesus have sent mine Angel to testify unto you these things in the churches I am the root and The Offspring of David and the bright and morning star and the spirit and the bride say come and let him that heareth say come and let let him that is a thirst come and whosoever will let him take the Water of Life freely for I testify unto every man that heareth the words of the prophecy of this book If any man shall add unto these things God shall add unto him the plagues that are written in this book and if any man shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy God shall take away his part out of the book of life and out of of the holy city and from the things which are written in this book he which testifieth these things saith surely I come quickly even so come Lord Jesus verse 21 the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all amen can you say Amen to the reading of the word so it's it's vitally important that we have all of the word of God and that we don't have anything that's not of the word of God and that we don't leave anything off that is of the word of God I'm glad today not only that when God required of the age to bring them to Perfection to take a church in a body change he required a faith in the word and the word only meaning no man-made Theory no uh no um mix no ad mixture the pure word and the unadulterated uncut unchanged unaltered Original Seed word of God and that word only now it's one thing for God to require that but what what would it be and what would we face today if he required it and he didn't give us access to it so now today I'm glad that he required it because I don't want to be in heaven debating 33,000 different iterations of Christianity I don't want to have 33,000 different denominations north of 33,000 in heaven to contend with and we're still over there contending with what's right what's wrong I'm glad that he's going to settle the matter at the end time and he's going to restore the Original Seed which was always the true word and and but not only am I glad that that's the requirement I'm glad that he gave us access to the revealed word and he invites whomsoever will to believe it now he doesn't say who will like John 3:16 whosoever whosoever will but it doesn't say who who will in fact is John 3:16 here we read the book of Revelations it doesn't even suggest anyone will it's just that whoever does and this is going to be your reward and so in order to find out whosoever will do it who's that going to be who's going to believe then you have to go into the book of Acts and the Bible says as many as were ordained believed so I'm glad to know that this isn't a dice roll this isn't a chance this is definitive this is certain we have believed the report heaven is real Christ is real the word is real and we're going in a real Rapture and a real body change to a real land and live in a real City brother Brandon and I'll have maybe a little more to say on that as I go brother Brandon back to our sermon on the future home brother brandham says in Titus 3:5 Paul is using this same word that means regeneration of men now he's using the word the the Greek word that Peter used about heavens and earth passing away and brother bandam has already explained it doesn't mean annihilated it just means it's it's a regeneration so he says he the he Paul is using the same word means regeneration of man that man has passed from a sinner to a saint not completely annihilated we've been dealing with that I'm glad that he didn't destroy me I'm glad when I have failures he doesn't annihilate me I'm glad he's annihilating everything from me that's not him and I just say annihilate Lord because when when it's all said and done I'll be left standing purely him see so he says when a man is changed he isn't annihilated but he's a changed person that's the basic tenant of Christianity so I'm sorry that people think they can be a Christian and not change anything see or at best they change their they start going to church or they start singing gospel songs but it's it's more change than that you've actually got to be a changed person not just change your habits sanctification will do that to you brother BR says it'll make you stop your lying and cheating it'll make you start going to church but that's not born again necessarily it leads to a new birth see all right so he says the man when a man is changed he isn't annihilated he's changed a changed person he's been changed from what he was to what he is not annihilated Jesus used the same word in Matthew 19 now I didn't put these on the screen on purpose because I I want to make a quite a bit of comment as we go I'm just going to read short excerpts and then make my comments so he says Jesus used the same word in Matthew 19:28 now he's not referring to the baptism of 2819 this is 1928 he says you'll set with me in my father's Kingdom regenerated you see changed so he says when you're changed he used the same word he used the same word when he said to the cult loose him and let him go said the same thing at the resurrection of Lazarus loose him change him he's been tied let him go so he says what does it mean the Earth will be loosed from the grip of Satan it'll be loosed it'll be loosed from politics it'll be loosed from denominational religious systems to be used for the the kingdom of God so the Earth is going to be repurposed it's not going to be used anymore for crooked politics or crooked entertainment and it's not going to have a people who are still tied to their old life it you're going to be new you're going to be changed you're going to be loosed just like the Earth is loosed from the grip of Satan you're going to be loosed you're going to live in a land and live in a body that cannot be tempted Hallelujah so he says it'll be loose and and used for the kingdom of God to establish it here on Earth and notice now he goes to the seven sabbaths so notice after 50 days or seven sabath sabbaths from there again there come another holy convocation so this is why he's explained that it was you know on the 50th day the Holy Ghost fell in the upper room see and so so after 49 days it comes on the 50th day and that's why it's called Pentecost because that's the Old Testament Feast that's the name of it the Pentecost feast and it's on it's it's after 50 days so brother brandham is showing that now that is at the end of seven sabbaths it's the baptism of the Holy Ghost it's the Eternal day now your soul is in an eternal day amen see so you've got three elements that have to be brought to their Eighth Day or back to the first day the original day the Eternal day and the first one has to be your soul Born Again of the spirit of God you're sitting together in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus you can never pass from there once you're there the second thing that had to come to its eighth day was the word of God it had to go beyond man-made manage thinking and it had to the book of redemption had to be open the mystery of redemption that the world has no access to see I want to get ahead of myself but we find that when the seals are open then the word comes to its eighth day but the Earth even in the Millennium the Earth is still in its seventh day and so it has to have a holy fire just like you had to have a holy fire just like this came through a holy fire it came by the pillar of fire and that's what's living inside of you and that's the new city that's where that city has been built so it's not just the millennial Earth which can't go on uh in in the seventh day see because it would it would never see God dwelling himself among his people he would always be uh limited to an office so he says here now so the Earth will be loosed so after 50 or seven sabbaths from there again there come another holy convocation what happened the Holy Ghost fell on the day of Pentecost so that's a holy convocation that's an eighth day that's an original day that's an eternal day that's why it can never be changed what Peter said can never be altered repent and be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ that can't be altered you can't Sid step and step around that that's part of the Holy convocation that's that's part of the mystery of redemption that was laid out see all right so he says on the eth day fell on the eighth day was seven sabbaths later exactly after his resurrection so it'd be seven time 7 again that's 49 bring it right back around to the first day of the week again exactly see so it's Eternal now just as your soul is eternal and and so now in the realm of the real you time is no longer counted now that's that should in your thinking if the real you is in eternity and time is no longer Counting Ed then that's why things that still happen in your life in this flesh in time can't be counted against you because this is in one realm and that's in another realm see so the real you you we we say all the time the real you didn't do it the real you has already passed into that realm is already sitting together in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus we do make mistakes John said we will but we have an with the father see he the the the virgin of you that's born of God do not commit sin he cannot he cannot it's impossible because he's already his seed remaineth in him and that's already transitioned you it's already loosed you it's already cha changed you you're loosed from the law of sin and death you are not any longer under the law of sin and death you are above the law you cannot be charged with a crime against the law because you're above the law see so brother brandham said so there is your holy convocation not have anything to do with literal things see so there are plenty of literal things that happen in our lives but the bride must understand her position in Christ so that she can come to a perfect faith and say it's not based on me it's based on him whom I have faith in and that's and that faith brother Brenham said that's the kind of relationship that is going to bring the dead Saints for hundreds of years out of the ground so so he says it's beyond that it's into the kingdom of God with eternal life with the predestinated that never did start it never started on any day you wasn't saved on any day now you're this is real Redemption mystery teaching this is what brother Jason talking about this in the back room this is what the world doesn't have access to all right let me let me read on before I make those comments so he says it was predestinated never did start it never started on a day you wasn't saved on a day so so my you say but you made a mistake yesterday I'm not judged in days I didn't start on a day it's it's it's the devil can point to he can point to yesterday and last last week day and last year day and 20 years ago Day none of that counts why because I have passed from days and weeks and months I'm in eternity so he says you always you were you was always saved Jesus just come to redeem that but you was saved from the beginning because you had eternal life to begin with amen amen so there's no such a thing as spiritual death now to the baptized saint of God just like all now watch him compare it again see I've been showing you the the comparison between the bride and that and that City just like all the curse is gone when the Holy Spirit accepts you you don't accept it it accepts you did you know that Jesus said that to his disciples you haven't chosen me actually I've chosen you see so you you don't accept it it accepts you cuz it's God's attribute see if if it's the holy ghost means God's spirit and it's the attribute the thought of God he accepted you because that you were ordained for that purpose yet you was born in sin come on that's right born in sin it's like everybody else Paul taught us that see because but he say he says so the thought of God has accepted you because that you were ordained for that purpose yet you was born in sin but God had that attribute and here you expressed yourself on Earth and he comes down and gets you you're back here he's talking about you know the that he's Drew he's drew it on the board of a human heart that's been that's been filled with the Holy Spirit and another one that's not and he says but here's where you started in this Pure Clean Place yeah you were born in sin you were over here but he came down and got you Hallelujah he came down and got me he came down and got you and he took you from there to hear and now you can't ever leave here see so this is the position you are and the whole thing is based on an attribute of God you he says he comes down to get you now you're back here here is where you belong can I say that to you today in spite of the devil brow beating you with unworthiness here is where you belong am Shalom bride good morning breathe the peace of God be upon you here's where you belong I know we all went away in a certain way but here's where you belong why did you come here cuz you didn't stay there why didn't you stay there cuz it was none fulfilling this gives you purpose Hallelujah so he goes on he says he so he comes down to get you see now you're back here where you belong sin has lost its power now it's still anointing our flesh but it has no power on my desires anymore there's there's desires than lust that come through the flesh but inside my heart I don't want that life and that's the desire God is looking at I don't want that life and brother B said it's what God looks in your heart at what you want to be I want to be like him see this is part of the Redemption mystery all right sin has lost its power the desire of sin has done gone from your heart when the Holy Spirit comes in you are a restored person so so so this is part of the mystery of redemption that takes the ministry of the son of man and a prophet to reveal the the world has all the way up through the man age the world has General access to the tenants of the word of God and the tenants of Christianity the world has that they they can read the the life stories of the Old Testament prophets and they can glean they can read the gospels and hear the tales of Jesus they can read Sermon on the Mount they can go through Peter's books and John's and Paul's and all of these different ones and and the Book of James and Jude and they and they can glean uh uh you know parts of this that give a a good life make you ex can make you give God uh um uh give put put you in the presence of God to where God can bless you and can favor your life but the but the parts of the book of The Mystery of redemption are not accessible right those are the parts they have no ACC that we say all the time it's a closed book we're not meaning the general tenants that the Bible teaches you can clean a lot by the children of Israel to the children of Israel God showed his acts and they learned from that but it was to Moses he showed his ways you understand and so so when you find out when it's like that you have the world so when the world says we don't need a prophet they don't know what they're talking about because it's only the ministry of the son of man that reveals the mystery of redemption and that and the ministry of the son of man operates through a prophet you have no access to there without a Ministry of the son of man see so so there you know it has some some some some relevance to right living but the mystery of redemption requires as brother random would show in the church age book it it's going to require more than just verse by verse comparison by Bible students it's going to require prophetic Insight amen see so I'm glad we have access to prophetic Insight I'm glad that I have access to the book of to the book of redemption that's why you under that's why you have access to the mystery of redemption because the mystery of red redemption was contained in the book of redemption and that's what the entire Book of Revelation is about it's about God redeeming his family and the Earth and his people and the kingdom and setting up a whole new civilization it's all about Redemption and in there was a seven sealed book of redemption and Christ opened it and gave it to a prophet who gave it to the people so now you have more access to the Mysteries than just common salvation from destruction there's a difference between salvation from destruction and Redemption so that's why when brother brandham is making these almost unimaginable statements that that God has accepted you because you were ordained yet you were born in sin but you you were an attribute you expressed yourself on Earth he come and got you now you're back here where you belong sin lost its power see and so so this is Mysteries under red Redemption that you have access to and the opportunity to be a believer of that clear so he goes on and then when the earth is restored by the same thing there can be no more cursing no more storms no more winds no more typhoons rather you're reconciled man and God is met the new Earth will be put on its Eden Beauty again the new Earth will be will spread forth her after her baptism of fire like the man was when he still had all right here here's a bulletin from your past like the man was when he still had when he still had hatred malice and strife in him when the fire baptism come it cleaned it off I mean unless you're sitting here today and saying uh still dealing with some of that m malice hatred and see he says no more jealousy no more of nothing it's just absolutely a dwelling place for God that's his delegation that's going to meet him out yonder so you see friends the Holy Ghost and Fire takes hatred malice Strife jealousy just like it purges it from the earth it the whole purpose of it is to purge it from you so just because you can sit here by and and understand the word of God and even agree with it and even say Amen to it does your life say Amen to it and when the Holy Fire of God sterilizes the Earth with the chemicals he Has Lifted his bride which can come into heaven with him while this is going on you remember Satan compasses at the end of the Millennium Satan compasses the holy city and the Lord the Bible says God takes his family and lifts them up on the breath of the earth and rains Holy Fire down upon it see so he says he lifts you up and then and then you're you're in heaven with him while this is going on and comes back down the Earth again a new heavens and a new Earth the cold winter can't hurt it the hot summers can't hurt it the deserts will Blossom like a rose sin and sinners are gone God and His create God and his creatures and creation is dwelling together in Perfect Harmony as the heavens and the Earth is husband and wife so is Christ and the church and they all meet in one big glorious Plan of Redemption and is brought right into the bosom of God again do you see it do you see it do you see it bethl Tabernacle do you see it see so while he's sterilizing the Earth I'm lifted up in him safe now that's happening right now because uh the my soul realm is now impervious it the the the the fires of tribulation and judgment are already falling on this Earth but they're not going to get me they weary this flesh they might even stumble this flesh but they ain't getting me because I've been lifted up into him and I'm safe see so he's showing here uh he says um he says let me catch these two paragraphs he says just as God created the Earth in six days made the Earth six days or 6,000 years referring to Peter a thousand years as a day he says and Christ is gone and is preparing a place that's been on its construction for many many thousands of years preparing a place and if I go and prepare a place I will come again and receive you that wherever I am you may be also notice the Redeemer and the redeemed so he's showing when we this is why when we look at that Holy City he's he's showing definitively the last word on who is a real Christian and and who have always been a real child of God so it's a definitive answer it's the last word I want you to remember that it's God's last word on who our real Christians and have always been real Christians say who is it it's those who have been a reflection of that City see you see the the correlation so it's the it's the what are some of the characteristics of that City how about this the absence of sin or impurity the golden streets of cleanness and Holiness the king Seated on his throne in your heart the pillar of fire on the top overshadowing all of our intelligence and all of our thoughts giving us the mind of Christ that's a real Christian just like that's a real city of the king so whenever people try to interpret what a Christian is and it's less than what you read about in that City to say uhuh because that's a reflection of this which is a reflection of that Hallelujah and that puts the devil to silence there's no doubt what it is to be a real Christian and be a real believer because when the book of redemption was open we could see the new city and fact is brother brandham refers to um in Revelation 34 to 23 I'm not going to read it today but brother brandham calls that the final Council because it's the message to leoda and he's he's saying here after 2,000 years this is where you've arrived you are you think you're rich and increased with Goods you're unaware you're blind that you're actually miserable and naked and poor and what you really have need of you think you need nothing but what you actually don't know is you need to buy of me gold tried in the fire you need a purity you don't have you need the garments of the word that you've rejected see and so he says I I counsel the he that hath an ear because in every age there was going to be people who had an ear there'd be people who sat shoulder toos shoulder in barrooms but they have an ear to hear the word of God there wouldd be people who were trapped behind denominational uh barb wire but they had an ear to hear the word whoever's got an ear come out of her my people I'm glad I had that kind of an ear I'm glad I heard an eagle scream see so he called it the final counsel this was God's final final Counsel on the age you're blind you're miserable stop saying you're great you're not great stop saying you're my church you're not even my church at all anymore you've kicked me out you you used to be my mouthpiece you're no longer my mouthpiece I have called a bride out of you and she is my mouthpiece she's the final voice to the final age her Doctrine her teaching her lifestyle is my last will in Testament do what you want say what you want let 33,000 say what they want let the Republicans the Democrats say whoever can say whatever but I am establishing in the Earth One More Time a true bride who's living in the True Image and she my last will in Testament and nothing will be altered whoever tries to add to it will add plagues and if you try to take away from what she's given I'll take your name out of the book of life amen see so God always has the last word on the matter and may I say God desires to have the last word in your life amen so this is why a prophet would say it's a great question is your life worthy of the Gospel see it's a great question what shall I do now forget pilate it's what shall I do I know what pilate did what shall I do with Jesus called the Christ we're not talking about his historical figure we're talking about Christ today in his word amen so God always wants your life to be the last word he doesn't just want you to believe the right the last word and say the last word and be the last sign this generation will ever see that's all true but he wants your life it's a shout and it's a voice and it's a trumpet and the thing that just happens just it's Christ doing them all William brandham had no message he didn't even have an education good grief he but he had an angel that ministered to him a Ministry of Divine Healing and the pillar of fire came into his room to break the book to break the book open to us see and it was Christ doing it you don't have the ability you're voice is not of any value to God it's your it's you when you've been converted and filled with the holy spirit of God then you're the final voice and the last thing that happens before the trumpet of God sounds and the dead and Christ rise is a final voice in The Bride to establish and give God the final say David and Goliath we find don't don't follow me in this brother Mark I'm just going to go across it quickly but you can go home and read 1st Samuel 17 and you find the story and you know Goliath and great big Philistine and he made all of his boast to David you know am I a dog that you you come out to me with staves and the Bible says the Philistine cursed David so he's running his mouth quite a bit and David's just standing there taking it he's waiting you know what he's waiting on to have the last saylah why why am I still here and why is the rapture not come because we're got to have the last say we got to have a bride that when the world is impossible to be an overcomer and yet we are Overcomers see am I a dog the Philistine cursed him and said to David come I'll give your flesh to the fowls to the beasts of the field and he you know that's all he could do and David finally waited till it was time for him to speak amen because because he was not about to give God was not about to give Goliath the last say and then David said to the Philistine thou comest to me with a sword and with a spear and with a shield but I come to thee in the name of the Lord hallelujah he goes on in verse 46 this day Not Another one not tomorrow put it on your put it on your calendar this day this very day will the Lord deliver thee into mine hand and I will smite thee and take thine head and all the assembly shall know that the Lord saveth not with sword and spear for the battle is the Lords and he will give you into our hands and that was the last word spoken and David got his stones and his sling and and Goliath drew his sword and moved on David and David grabbed his sling and ran to meet him and slung a sling and popped him between the eyes knocked him down jumped on him took his own sword and fulfilled the word of God David was literally it went from words to life and he literally became the word made flesh it was the last say that's always going to be God's desire is to be the last save Jesus is in the wilderness with Satan and Satan's got every kind of thing finally takes him shows him the kingdoms of the world and saith unto him all these things will I give thee if thou will fall down and worship me then saith Jesus unto him get thee hence Satan for it is written Thou shalt Worship the Lord thy God and him only shalt thou serve and that was the end of the battle that was the end of the discussion and the devil leave left him and angels ministered to him I'm here to tell you something I'm looking forward to a day when the devil keeps trying trying to deceive me keeps trying to pull me aside he finally it says I can't do nothing with this guy you just need to go in a Rapture I say thank you very much that's exactly what I'm going to do Hallelujah friends that's where we are don't ever give the devil the last say in your life Jesus stands with pilate in John 19 then said pilate unto him they' been all this discourse are you a king th say is well your people say this and that and if it were not you know if this were true they're in this discussion and then pilate said unto him speakest thou not unto me knowest thou not look at this look at this Doctrine if you'll notice that in Goliath and in Satan and now in pilate they're all misrepresenting the truth Goliath said this is what I'll do and David said that's actually not true here's what's going to happen Satan said to him this is what I'll do and Jesus said no that's contrary to the word the word of God is going to be the last say then said pilate unto him speakest thou not unto me knowest thou not that I have power to crucify thee and have power to release thee that was such a lie that was so not true I'm here to tell you something friends I know the devil tries to say what he can and can't do it's a lie he has no authority over God's people Jesus said thou couldest have no power at all against me except it were given to thee from above no matter what Satan can do he's got to get permission from my heavenly father he has no jurisdiction over my life no authority over my life I have renounced him I'm living for the king I'm an ambassador of a new world there's power in the name of jesusall see so so this is so now think about our text so when we read and now you're coming down to the end of the Bible and here comes your last verse the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all amen so there's no discourse there there the devil's not here in revelation 22 arguing that Jesus said this is his last promise I'm telling you I'm giving you my promise that the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ will be with you amen so be it that's it the Challenger is gone the challenge has been put down the last accusation has been against God's family has been silenced and Grace is the last promise and amen is the last word hallelujah and I have passed from Death to life under grace that's the amen and I am bringing forth I'm a final voice to the final agent Satan is silenced amen amen God wants to be the Amen in your life yesj God wants to be the last word in your life will you let him today will you let him young people will you say I want your word to be the last word I want your word to be the amen forget what I think it's I only want what you think Lord how many today can say Lord grant that to me hallelujah it's what we desire so brother brandham says yeah you're a part of the earth your body your soul is part of God that beautiful not simple you're a part of the earth your body your soul is a part of God an attribute of God displayed here on Earth in a body the body is to be redeemed now the Soul's redeemed because it was in sin amen only four people your soul is redeemed CU it used to be in sin we're just waiting on the body to get redeemed see but in my body I'm being the final voice I'm being the amen of the word amen this why there's no backing down that's why there's no compromise that's why the ministry team here we're not going to preach you a watered down gospel nothing do you don't even want that you wouldn't stay here if we started preaching that you're Eagles and you want Eagle food and we're all more happy to supply you with eagle food we have no backing up no compromise on the word of God we're not interested in pleasing the world we interested in pleasing the master so he says the body to be redeemed now the soul is redeemed because it was in sin so God come down by process of justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost and redeemed your soul and you being part of the Earth see this is this is Insider stuff this is redemption mystery see and you I mean I can read this these secrets to the world that's not really that you're hearing it read or that you're getting to read the mystery the book God opened to you that's not it I can read these words to the world they don't believe them they don't accept it oh no that's not true well okay good luck with that but I believe it's true so he says he redeemed your soul and you being a part of the earth it's Redeemed by it you're in the process now it's growing on your body was justified under Noah's baptism amen and your flesh speaking of Jesus on the cross when he his blood run down the cross when it dropped upon there and the Earth is to be cleansed by fire so in Noah's day it got its baptism of water Jesus blood ran down the cross onto the Earth and baptized it in justification now sanctification but it's got but then the church went on to Pentecost the earth goes through a millennium and goes on to to the to the Eighth Day Pentecost amen see and so he says and the Earth is to be cleansed by fire the place where you live with the baptism of the Holy Spirit don't you see now watch him watch him just bring this down to just to just common language don't you see the towns the cities the houses the dwellings are speaking of that right now all these natural things are a shadow brother Brandon would say you see a tree struggling to live he says that is proof that there's one somewhere not struggling said you see a man struggling gasping the death rattle in his throat gasping for air trying to live he said that shows that there's a body somewhere that doesn't do that Hallelujah indeed doesn't struggle doesn't have pain there's no yesterday there's no tomorrow it's just all right now you've just arrived a prophet could even have words to explain it and that's just under the altar in the sixth Dimension think of what that realm is going to be friends no wonder Paul could say it's never entered into the heart of man even in your imagination I can imagine quite a bit I can't imagine what that'll be the reality of it opening up so he says don't you see the towns the cities the houses the dwellings are speaking of that right now all these natural things are a shadow and he gives an example take a shadow at a distance like my hand before there can be a positive or A negative there has to be a positive see so you can't see it but I know you know what I'm talking about I could put it up here on the wall see there's my there's my a reflection of my hand now it's all very faint you can't even hardly make out the details until I start moving close and The Closer I Get The Sharper it gets the further you go along the closer you're getting you understand the more in line your body is coming into that because you're facing challenges if just by virtue of nothing more than the fact that the world is more nuts just by virtue of the fact that the world is more insane than it's ever been and the days of Sodom and the days of of lot and Sodom and Noah and his age are upon us together and now it's 6,000 years and Satan's had 6,000 years to build his Eden and he's the God of this evil age and the world is more crazy and more impossible than it's ever been if if if just by virtue of that alone and you're still standing against that tidal wave where it's impossible to stand but you're still standing I know the Devil beats you up because you don't always feel like a superch Christian trust me you're a superch Christian trust me you're a super race a super people and you've got a perfect faith more perfect Faith than you're aware of amen amen how much Faith does it take to see our loved ones drifting away but have a power of Faith to take the word of God and claim them and apply a token and hold on until a supernatural God moves on the scene and brings your words into reality Hallelujah friends that's what the word has given to us today see so he says it's a shadow all these Natural Things says take a shadow distance like my hand before there can be a positive or A negative there has to be a positive you see that shadow look like I got a dozen fingers but then when you get go to getting it close together it focuses down to one and then the shadow Fades into the hand that's a lot of times people thinks there's three or four Gods because they're look too far back in the early Reformation they haven't focused the lens see brother Bram in another place he's and and this this to do with Optics that's what Shadows that it looks like in photography you have when they when they invented film paper film you had negatives see and so so but then you had a you had the the photograph when after it was finished developing so so so I don't want to get ahead of myself let me go through this finish this quote then I'll give you my thought so brother Brown talks about it in one other place he said the other day Billy gave me some I think it was a camera and he said Daddy and they stopped along the side of the road and he said there was I think there was antalope out across the Prairie and he said take a picture and brother brandham looked in the camera and he said I was looking at one and I could see two or three and he said there something wrong with this camera and he said no Daddy you got to focus it and so he started turning the lens he said and all three came into one see and that's the way he said they're looking too far back under the Reformation that's why they see three and four Gods if you would just focus it and focus it to the revealed word of this hour Not only would you see one God but you'd see you're a part of his godhead see you're talking about focusing because what you're focusing on is the book of redemption friends this is just beautiful you enjoying the word I'm watching my time I'm only going to get so far I've already got it marked so he said it focuses down and then the shadow Fades into the hand see so that's a lot of times and he goes on he says come on down now you'll find the focus focus is into there's one exactly so so the world let me say this to you today you know there's all kinds of conspiracy uh people who just don't even know what they're talking about and they they say oh this is just a simulation you're just living in a simulation it's all just a matrix anyway and and they actually believe that they have convinced themselves that nothing is real that that that that the Earth is just a little playground for some great whatever some great energy some great intelligence or maybe it's nothing of any of that and and and life here is just meaningless anyway and when you're done here you're done what a shallow life well I mean if I had to believe that with all the trials and tribulations I've had to go through and if I didn't believe there's a world coming and a body that I'm going to get to live in and go back and recapture my youth and recapture my health and and and have all of that back with No Malice or hatred or jealousy or Envy or all of those things Hallelujah so we're seeing here by what a prophet is saying the world is not a simulation so so so but it is a shadow see it's it's like a in one s and I'll give you another sense of it here in a minute so it's like it's like a photographic film negative like a negative that back in the days of film it's make actually making quite a Resurgence but but film is so authentic it's not like digital where you got to you know takes nine images and gets the best one then you just got to tweak it and the the the the the film as long as your lighting is good you can get actually what it was and there's and photographers who are going back to it saying there's something about film that you just can't cat capture digitally there's a real there's a realness to it and and so so the when you're looking at a negative like back in the days of photography of film photography the images that you see on the negative are real they're just not finished they're Shadow they're a negative they're real they're not a simulation you're looking at that negative you hold up light and go oh I see my mom there look at that see but everything's inverted and so the darks are lights and the lights are dark and it takes a process to get the whole thing finished I mean my life here I know it doesn't look like that life there you know why it's inverted I'm in a shadow I know this body doesn't look very Eternal but I got one that does hallelujah I know I have all kinds of problems in my mind and you got all problems but my mind is upside down but I got a positive one coming I got one that's going to be finished he's putting me through the process right now that's what you're sitting here today you're being processed from a negative to a positive see it's not a simulation the only reason it appear you know when when when when we look at a shadow the reason that a shadow appears real to you is because you're Shadow you're a shadow looking at Shadow you're a negative looking at a negative so so it it appears real so so you're a shadow looking at a shadow now so you you perceive it as real but just remember you are real amen but you're not done amen you're not finished you're not yet he's still working on me my kid just sing that when they were little I'm going to make them all sing it next Sunday to make me what I ought to be see so the the images are real they're just not finished all right so so can I so the the shadow of you is not the final say hallelujah take that devil yeah I look in the man in the mirror and I go boy you got problems but then I go yeah but you ain't finished yet Hallelujah this ain't the final say of Jason Watkins thank God thank God thank God Hallelujah see so it's not the final say now so let me let me give you some more things that a Kentucky Hill belly explained it so simply because life life is a shadow life is a negative but life is not non-reality it's not a simulation see as broken as it is with all of its hardship and all of its loss it is real it is it's not a simulation I mean friends the Garden of Eden wasn't a simulation the the the very what Adam and Eve did when they collapsed it and they and they fell that was not a simulation I'm here to tell you hell is not a simulation you best believe that hell is not a simulation all a man or a woman going there for rejecting the Divine propitiation in the death burial and resurrection of Jesus Christ people who go there that's not a simulation and I'll tell you further the sufferings of the Lord Jesus Christ was not a simulation he suffered for real he suffered in a body he's not like the Gnostic settle he's just an apparition he's just a a phantom he was real he was a man John said we've handled God we handled him with our own hands Calvary was not a simulation his suffering was not a simulation I'll promise you that perfect life oh my that we're headed to friends is not a simulation so life is real but by virtue of it not being the original order it fell into Shadow so brother brandham explained it by drawing a perfect circle and down here in the bottom of the circle he drew a little Loop down it the circle's coming around and then it loops Loops down back up into the circle again and that's the whole Plan of Redemption he says my wife ma called it a little hickey just a little drop down from eternity into time to accomplish Redemption and everything from Genesis to Revelation 4,000 years of Old Testament history and 2,000 years of New Testament history and we've looped down and back up and we're almost ready to hit the circle again oh friends happy day happy day oh my see so so it's a it's a lower form of reality uh and most importantly it's not the original reality and that is what this message is so much about on the future home that he's trying to say you have a future a reality in the future that's more real this one is just a this one is transitory you're just a transient you're just passing through this world isn't even your home this life's not even about this life it's just a proven ground it's a training field you're being called back up into eternity you've been given the open book of redemption to believe it say Amen to every word and your life come and be a final voice to the final age to bring the sleeping Saints see so so it fell from its Eternal realm in the Garden of Eden brother Ram talks about that realm was in Eternal realm and it fell down into a lower form of reality uh that's not the original reality and that's exactly why friends that's exactly why if time is anything it's temporary you just remember that I mean if time's anything at all and there's a lot about the SpaceTime Continuum that science don't even understand but just understand this it's not the original time is not the original and time's going to run out and that that new heavens and new earth is not in time and time is never coming back again Hallelujah I don't care what you're suffering right now it's temporary I don't care what's happening in your life I don't care if it's sickness if it's finances if the devil's got your children it's temporary it's temporary God's plan will prevail Hallelujah we all grieve our fallen Humanity what they've done to the Earth we all grieve that amen what they've done to the world order of things and all the Crooked politics and the filthy entertainments and the open filth on the streets and in the public places and and I mean ultimately ultimately friends listen ultimately we we always knew that the world would finally come to Total Insanity see so we're not even to be amazed Peter said when these fiery trials don't even be amazed at that we always knew the world was coming to its complete Insanity the total depravity where it is right now amen where it is right now that even even society as a whole as as Paul said who knowing the Judgment of God that they which commit such things are worthy of death meaning at the Judgment bar people who reject this word and live that kind of a life are worthy of death at the Judgment don't think that God is being evil to destroy them God so loved the world he came as a man and died for them I don't think he needs to prove his love I don't think God has anything to prove to the planet Earth see and so Paul warned the alpha Church of this in Romans 1:32 William brandham warned the the Omega Church Paul warned the alpha Church William brandham warned the Omega Church that the world would go totally insane amen is that right and and and Paul Paul even included the blindness of the age notwithstanding that they fully know the Judgment of God even though it's a blind age that Paul acknowledges in that 32nd verse that that they actually they know they they fully know the Judgment of God not only do the same themselves but have pleasure in others that do them th this is exactly why the ESV translates that 32nd verse like this listen though they know God's righteous decrees that those who practice such things deserve to die they not only do them but give approval to those who practice them see Eugene Peterson in his message translation says verse 32 and it's not as if they don't know better they know perfectly well they're spitting in God face and they don't care worse they hand out prizes to those who do the worst things best come from another planet come from another galaxy and live on this Earth for 30 days and tell me that's not true come come from a whole another universe and live and walk this Earth for 30 days and try to say Paul was wrong or William Brandon was wrong saying the world would go totally insane oh it's true friends it's it's true the world over in every nation it's true in every nation in every tongue now you got a seat belt on you better buckle up might better cinch my belt up this is tough how many Believers are here so now it's Elijah's turn in the Omega age to amplify that and he quotes the scripture they have pleasure in them that do them that's that's the point I'm making Paul said not only do they know better but they actually take pleasure in not only do they do it but they take pleasure in the people that do they give rewards to the people who sin the best isn't that the age we've come to everybody the worse you can send the more vow you can be and and and and they've got some of the most vile un un almost indescribably runchy women who are now the role models for 12-year-old girls the most runchy and vulgar worse than worse than who was that brother brandom said they and feathered Calamity Jane or whoever that was she was nothing compared to what they have now she at least she didn't walk out in public in her underwear didn't talk vulgar like that she cussed like men and wore pants and rode a horse and so they tired and feathered her and yet today they exalt these women that do that yes they exalt these men who chase after them and worship them that's why I so appreciated brother Jason's sermon today his lesson on in Sunday school that that men that men are being broken down at the W worshiping at the idol of women see ill- famed women the the the this not an accident the Bible said it would be here a prophet back in CB Scout days said it would be here and it is here Marilyn Monroe was almost a a none compared to today brother brandham takes this verse have pleasure in them that do them he said you might say this is from the message my favorite message is your life worthy of the Gospel he said you might say I would never come to that point let me see a list of your friends and Associates the ones that you commit the most amount of your time to and I'll tell you who you have pleasure in you let me see what you look at and what you read and the kind of music you listen to the crowd you associate with and I'll tell you what kind of a spirit is in you where God is looking for a people who are willing to be a different voice who are willing who are saying I will not be the I will not be these people who take pleasure in ungodliness and I will not take pleasure in the people who who they support I will not support I will not condone I will not associate myself if if I have to live alone on a Mountaintop I will not associate with this ungodly world see so we can't say we don't know these things friend can't say that you can't say it you've been spending your whole life reading these listening to these messages reading your Bible yeah so so we can't say uh that we don't know these things the question is do you care see that's what uh that's what the ESV says that that that the people who do these things they don't care they they know they're spitting in God's face they don't care so the question is today I do do you care I can tell you this he cares do you careen answer that young people don't don't answer it to brother Jason answer it in your heart he cares do you care he cares to save you and redeem you and change you and clean your life up do you care to be cleaned and revived and and repurposed to live for God let me tell you what he knows about you let me tell you friends that why his grace just keeps reaching to us again and again let me tell you why he won't let you go because here's what he knows he knows you were born in sin he knows that you came trapped in a fallen nature and this is exactly why David pleaded with the Lord to not judge him by his missteps and his his failures but to judge him by his heart said if you judge me by my works I'm finished but if you'll Judge Me by My Heart Lord I love you job did the same thing job pleaded with the Lord that that he could be weighed on honest scales Lord weigh my heart on honest scales that I love you now it it blew my mind when I thought about these men I thought about this last night or this morning that blew my mind when I thought about that these men could pray like that and they were unconverted and they didn't not only did they not have the Holy Ghost they didn't have access to it see so so they didn't have the new birth that we had have and and so so then as such as such then then there'd be no way for them to escape the enmity that exists in their minds that that is against God Paul said that your Fallen mind is enmity against God's word it can never agree with God so they they had no way to escape the darkness in their hearts from a wrong birth no way like you have David had no way to escape the darkness job had no way to escape the darkness in his heart from a wrong birth they had no way to escape the enmity of their minds that was against God by being born in sin and yet job and David could still cry out for a clean heart I'm here to tell you there had to be a different identity somewhere oh there had to be something in the eternities there had to be another representation That's The Power of this represent ation you with the Holy Ghost have the ability to not only long for it but to become it hallelujah oh my I thought to myself if David could have lived in this day if David could have lived under the baptism of the Holy Ghost if David could be here today and enjoy the message that we enjoy he he he he could have he could have looked to the truth of God's word and and and David could could have written all David could have WR WR the psalm like this all at once I looked up and I said I'm not the son of Charles and Ella Branham if David could have looked up could have come to this message he could have wrote in the Psalms all at once I looked up and I said I'm not the son of Jesse and nevit I'm not the great-grandson of Ruth and Boaz there's another me in another world another reality oh friends that's the privilege that you and I have today and this is why God Ran after you because he knew that you were born with a nature that was not your original nature you're just in a shadow you've dropped down Oh my he always knew he always knew when he was chasing you and you were running but God wasn't worried cuz he knew it was temporary he knew he would eventually corner you and reveal himself to you and you would come to your senses and say say my father I have a father I'm not from here I'm not finishing here I'm believing to the word of God I'm believing the word of this hour oh my on that day when Mama Eagle went hunting for her child see so now by the new birth we are creations of Christ we are brand new units amen and now Satan will will never have the last say how many want to have the last say and say what I say Amen stand to your feet friends that's the truth that's so much of the meaning that brother Brandon was trying to get across to people when he's preaching he's not just preaching about streets of gold and walls of Jasper you can read all of that in the Bible but he's breaking into the mystery of redemption and he's showing you hey guess what oh go figure he's redeeming you just like he's redeeming that he's Redeeming the Earth just like he's redeeming you the whole thing works together you're in a shadow here now you're born in sin you got a body that won't cooperate you got a mind that was inity you had a heart that was darkened but don't worry because I got a plan for that I'm putting an attribute of myself down inside of you and on a certain day when Mama eagle goes looking for that child oh she flew over over my way and the word screamed to me friends come on this morning Hallelujah do you accept that God has had that plan for you all along you accept that you have Insider information that the world can't understand they cannot understand it they cannot understand why you live and you don't you won't participate in the world it's I you know I don't participate in the world because I don't want to there's something down inside of me I know I'm in a shadow but I'm only in a shadow because I'm not in the original form form I'm going back to the original the world is in a shadow only because it dropped down into a shadow that's not its original form you can best believe that that's why brother brandham said in that world he said there will never be a bobbed haired woman go in there he said I'll promise you that he said cigarette smoking painted face Jezebel he said you'll never see one on that side said they don't care he said I promise you and that's that was thus sayith the Lord said she'll never get there yeah that's what Paul assured us of there won't be any kind of thing like that oh my all is peace forever more on that happy Golden Shore well there's your third installment got more to say not getting to n no come on Gideon's at 9ine so if I'm at 3 no we ain't doing no but uh well I've been wrong amen let's sing brother Kenny I'm quite finished today amen give the Holy Spirit some time to water the seed of the
