[30:29] last year ended
[30:31] oh my praise the Lord I say I'm not only
[30:34] as much but I want to go higher and
[30:36] higher
[30:37] deeper and deeper closer and closer Amen
[30:40] in the presence of the Lord amen had a
[30:44] wonderful time I got to see some video
[30:46] clips last night brother Diggs with the
[30:50] young people was that last night or
[30:51] Friday night Friday night very good and
[30:54] then I think last night they had uh were
[30:56] you were you surprised
[30:57] [Laughter]
[30:59] amen praise the Lord so uh big dog had a
[31:03] birthday and so I told him I said
[31:05] according to brother Joel Forney you can
[31:06] call a man a dog as long as you call him
[31:07] a big dog
[31:09] amen so uh we wanted to wish him a happy
[31:12] birthday
[31:13] sure loved brother Aaron and his
[31:15] wonderful family amen praise God second
[31:18] Thessalonians chapter 2 I want to begin
[31:22] today uh with part two of the spirit of
[31:25] lawlessness that we started on with our
[31:28] first Sunday into the new year
[31:30] and want to look uh at continuing on
[31:34] praise the Lord first a second
[31:36] Thessalonians chapter 2.
[31:39] let's begin at verse 1.
[31:42] now we beseech you Brethren by the
[31:45] coming of our Lord Jesus Christ
[31:48] and by our gathering together unto him
[31:52] that you be not soon shaken in mind or
[31:56] be troubled neither by Spirit nor by
[31:59] word nor by letter as from us as that
[32:02] the day of Christ is at hand
[32:06] let no man deceive you by any means for
[32:10] that day shall not come except there
[32:13] come a falling away first and that man
[32:16] of sin be revealed the son of perdition
[32:21] who opposeth and exalteth himself above
[32:25] all that is called God or that is
[32:28] worshiped so that he as God sitteth in
[32:33] the temple of God showing himself that
[32:36] he is God
[32:37] so this is quite a trick of smoke and
[32:40] mirrors that the devil is able to pull
[32:44] off you'd think this is impossible how
[32:47] could anyone mistake Lucifer for the
[32:50] true God
[32:51] but actually he's going to set right in
[32:53] the temple of God in other words you
[32:56] know we know that the Bible shows us
[32:58] that our in our flesh our bodies are the
[33:01] Temple of the Lord so he's going to set
[33:03] right that was his desire to set in the
[33:06] congregation
[33:07] remember that so so this is shocking
[33:11] that the prophecy is telling us in no
[33:14] uncertain terms that at the end time the
[33:19] whole Christian world except for those
[33:23] who it's impossible to deceive
[33:26] amen
[33:28] everybody else is going to get duped
[33:31] into believing that they're worshiping
[33:34] God
[33:35] and pleasing God and all the time
[33:38] they're worshiping the devil
[33:41] that that's mind-blowing
[33:44] and that's that's really
[33:47] what what causes the age that coming to
[33:52] pass is why in the Old Testament it was
[33:56] called darkness and gross Darkness on
[34:00] the people
[34:01] so actually the the evil in the world
[34:05] the man's man's mind is even worse
[34:10] and the only way you can get worse than
[34:14] evil is to worship evil
[34:18] amen friends to those who it's
[34:21] impossible to deceive to those who are
[34:24] predestinated not to fall
[34:26] I say to you Shalom good morning
[34:29] oh let the son of righteousness rise in
[34:33] our midst today where a great grand
[34:35] privileged people to believe and see and
[34:38] hear what we see and hear
[34:40] there is a great spirit of lawlessness
[34:43] in the world Amen let's bow our heads
[34:48] father we thank you for this word and
[34:50] feeling your anointing speedily we're
[34:53] very grateful to you for that and I pray
[34:56] now that you'll break the bread of life
[34:57] to us Lord as you have opened my heart
[35:01] to it I pray I'm able to convey it
[35:04] father I commit it to you give us sharp
[35:08] Minds may we just now Lord
[35:10] capture our minds Lord we dismiss the
[35:13] cares of yesterday and the plans for
[35:15] tomorrow and if tomorrow even arrives
[35:19] Lord why why should we worry about it as
[35:21] you said sufficient is the day Lord and
[35:24] so we don't even have a guarantee of
[35:26] tomorrow why would we surely we wouldn't
[35:29] sit here at the moment of eternal life
[35:31] hearing the word of God and be thinking
[35:32] about uh something that may not even
[35:34] come Lord and whatever happened
[35:37] yesterday can't be undone so all we can
[35:40] do is appeal to your Grace today
[35:42] we commit ourselves into your hands for
[35:45] the word
[35:46] give us hearing Hearts we pray in Jesus
[35:48] name amen God bless you friends you can
[35:50] be seated
[35:54] staggering
[35:55] prophecy that Paul is laying out here
[35:59] and how that
[36:02] his uh you know he's saying now we
[36:04] beseech you brother brother and so so
[36:07] this is uh a kind of a power word that
[36:10] Paul is using to say hey I'm making a
[36:13] big point
[36:14] I I'm earnestly saying this I'm not just
[36:18] casually I beseech you I implore you I
[36:22] appeal to you you know pay pay close
[36:25] attention because we're we're we're
[36:27] going to speak about the coming of the
[36:30] Lord Jesus Christ and our gathering
[36:32] together unto him I mean Paul could not
[36:35] preface the principle he's about to make
[36:38] and the prophecy he's about to give I
[36:40] don't think he could build a better
[36:41] platform to get the bride's attention
[36:45] to say listen what I'm about to say is
[36:49] relevant to the coming of the Lord
[36:52] is there anything in your Christian
[36:54] experience more important than that
[36:57] see so Paul is saying he's saying I'm
[36:59] I'm going to establish this upon we're
[37:02] going to talk about the coming of the
[37:04] Lord and our gathering together unto him
[37:08] not we're not just going to come to
[37:09] church there's coming a day Friends when
[37:12] the dead in Christ are going to rise we
[37:15] which are alive will be changed and in a
[37:17] month or so meet the Lord in the air
[37:20] this is a gathering together unto him
[37:23] there's nothing more Paramount there's
[37:25] nothing more important there should be
[37:27] nothing that occupies your Christianity
[37:29] more than pressing toward that Mark of
[37:33] that prize of that High Calling
[37:36] is that a fair statement
[37:40] so there could be nothing more important
[37:43] then
[37:45] I mean if you think about how Paul is
[37:47] capturing our attention does I mean if
[37:50] if you're just listening to Paul and you
[37:52] don't read the next verse yet you're
[37:54] going wow oh he's getting ready to make
[37:57] on enormous point
[38:00] wow let me pay attention it might be
[38:01] quiet hold on Paul let's get ready to
[38:03] say something about the coming of the
[38:05] Lord
[38:06] about my gathering together unto him
[38:08] children sit still everybody patient
[38:11] here comes get ready
[38:13] see Don't Be Shaken in mind
[38:16] huh are troubled you mean Paul what are
[38:20] you saying what Paul is trying to tell
[38:23] you is that there's coming something at
[38:25] the end time at the coming of the Lord
[38:28] just before we gather together there's
[38:30] coming something in the world that
[38:33] shakes the mind of men and Paul is
[38:35] saying don't you get caught in that
[38:39] not by any means
[38:42] don't not by by Spirit by word or even a
[38:46] letter from US
[38:48] see let no man deceive you by any means
[38:50] for that day shall not come except
[38:52] they're coming here's a big one
[38:54] there's going to come A Falling Away
[38:56] first and that man of sin
[39:00] is going to be revealed the Son of
[39:02] Perdition so this man of sin the ESV
[39:05] which we're going to look at quite a bit
[39:07] and I don't think they have it in the
[39:09] back uh but I'm and so it's okay but I'm
[39:13] going to Gideon if you can secure the
[39:15] ESV translation fine don't worry about
[39:16] it if you can't but I'm going to read it
[39:19] to you and you're going to see how many
[39:22] times Paul is going to use this word and
[39:24] it's a in the King James it's most often
[39:27] iniquity
[39:29] because that's a that's a really bad sin
[39:32] because that means you actually knew
[39:34] better and did it anyway
[39:36] see and so and so are you new what God
[39:40] was telling you to do and you refused it
[39:45] my and that just it takes my breath away
[39:48] I said Lord don't ever let me be guilty
[39:50] of that brother Bradham said I would
[39:52] rather face God as a sinner
[39:55] then face him as a hypocrite
[39:58] I mean that's a mouthful from a prophet
[40:01] I'd rather face him as a sinner
[40:04] but whatever I do don't face him as a
[40:07] hypocrite
[40:08] don't sit in the house of God year and
[40:11] year out and just be a hypocrite
[40:13] you're coming here to receive life so I
[40:16] say to you receive life
[40:19] receive all that God has for you and
[40:21] don't hold back and don't hinder him
[40:24] because the only the only person that
[40:28] has the authority
[40:29] in creation
[40:32] the only person that has authority to
[40:34] hinder God from helping you
[40:37] is you
[40:39] and that's a delegated authority from
[40:42] him
[40:43] he set his kingdom up in that way that
[40:45] he wouldn't force himself on you that he
[40:48] he implores you to open your heart and
[40:51] open your mind and cast down vain
[40:54] imagination and bring every thought
[40:56] subject to him but he won't force you to
[40:58] do that
[40:59] see he says to you he pleads with you
[41:02] let the mind which was in Christ be in
[41:05] you but he won't jam it in there if you
[41:07] block it
[41:08] he he goes he has the Apostle Paul to
[41:11] write to you to to to the Believers and
[41:15] says let the word of God dwell in you
[41:18] richly how about it come on
[41:21] how about it here's a good idea allow
[41:24] permit you Believers permit the word of
[41:27] God to dwell in you not casually not
[41:30] mediocrity but let it dwell in you
[41:33] richly
[41:37] see there's where your free moral agency
[41:39] resides
[41:41] you're saved through faith by grace
[41:45] see but now when it comes to your to
[41:48] your overcoming that's why brother
[41:49] Brandon when he would go he would go to
[41:51] the book of Philemon and he would say
[41:53] you know brother Brandon will talk about
[41:55] all the hell that Paul started all of it
[41:57] started his letters
[41:59] and he would he would say Paul Paul you
[42:03] know a servant uh of Jesus Christ Paul
[42:06] an apostle of Jesus Christ not by the
[42:08] will of man you know and you know Paul
[42:11] and have all these different ways of
[42:13] starting his letters Paul an apostle
[42:15] Paul a servant Paul you know a minister
[42:18] for your sake but when he comes to this
[42:20] book he says Paul a prisoner
[42:26] and now there's other places where Paul
[42:28] talks about being a prisoner brother
[42:30] Brown's not suggesting that's the only
[42:31] place he's just saying as far as opening
[42:34] a letter he's starting a letter Paul is
[42:37] the only place he says Paul a prisoner
[42:39] and brother Branham says to be a to be a
[42:41] servant of God to be an apostle of God
[42:43] that's just that's God's choosing God
[42:45] has to call a man to that he says but to
[42:48] be a prisoner that's you that's your
[42:51] choice
[42:52] that's you making that decision see so
[42:57] so God called him to be an apostle God
[43:00] called him to be a minister uh to the
[43:03] Gentiles but Paul had to elect to choose
[43:06] to be a slave to be a prisoner
[43:09] see
[43:10] so we find that in this age that's
[43:13] coming
[43:15] this man of sin
[43:17] is to be revealed he's the son of
[43:20] perdition so now here is where we
[43:23] I don't know if it's the last point I
[43:25] made in part one but we were making the
[43:29] point to you somewhere I believe near
[43:31] the end if not the end of how that
[43:34] that you know in the Old Testament there
[43:37] were all kinds of prophecies that that
[43:40] the text on parchment written by
[43:43] chroniclers and Prophets
[43:45] that that text migrated
[43:48] and it became flesh in Jesus
[43:52] and so so there was a migration
[43:55] see and so when Jesus is getting ready
[43:59] to go away and he says now a little
[44:02] while the world won't see me but you'll
[44:03] see me for I'll be with you even in you
[44:05] that became a text and they even even
[44:08] wrote it down the the the writers of the
[44:10] Gospel put that on paper
[44:13] but on the day of Pentecost that paper
[44:15] word migrated to become flesh and I'm
[44:18] not talking about when it got put on
[44:20] paper I'm just simply making the point
[44:22] that in the upper room that prophecy
[44:25] that came out of the words of Our Lord
[44:27] actually went to a migration until it
[44:31] became humans
[44:34] so now here Paul is talking about the
[44:36] end time the Kingdom time the Gathering
[44:39] time the coming time and he says there's
[44:42] a man of sin that's going to be revealed
[44:44] in other words revealed means to be
[44:47] uncovered
[44:48] see that that's what the book apocalypse
[44:51] is the Book of Revelation means all
[44:53] right now that microphone is already
[44:55] there I'm not about to create it I'm
[44:58] just going to reveal it
[45:00] I'm going to uncover it see and so he's
[45:04] saying that because the spirit of
[45:06] lawlessness you're going to hear in a
[45:07] minute the spirit of of lawlessness this
[45:10] man of sin this Antichrist Spirit doth
[45:14] already work in the church
[45:16] but I'm here to tell you at the end time
[45:19] at the Kingdom time at the coming time
[45:22] just before we gather together
[45:26] these words this man of sin must be
[45:29] revealed is going to migrate to flesh
[45:34] there's going to be a migration from the
[45:37] page that the text is in migration it's
[45:40] being material I say why is the world in
[45:42] such a shape because this text is being
[45:45] materialized in real time
[45:49] and it's happening right around you and
[45:51] it will be more materialized tomorrow
[45:57] I think it would do good for us to
[45:58] remember that the things of the world
[46:01] are an antichrist Spirit materialized
[46:05] you just remember that
[46:07] the next time you're giving too much
[46:09] carnality to the modern world and all of
[46:13] its entertainments
[46:15] think about that young people next time
[46:17] you've got your computer in your hand
[46:19] and you're scrolling through all of its
[46:21] stupid nonsense
[46:23] you're you're looking at the man of sin
[46:25] being materialized and he's trying to
[46:27] make to materialize inside of you
[46:30] just like the word is trying to become
[46:33] material inside of you there's a there's
[46:36] a man of sin trying to become material
[46:40] to sit in the congregation
[46:43] and in among the saints and be counted
[46:45] as a worshiped being
[46:48] I think that's powerful
[46:52] say is it so bad all right let's see how
[46:54] bad it is this man of sin
[46:56] who opposeth
[46:58] and exalteth himself above all that is
[47:02] called God
[47:04] so now put that
[47:07] on your list
[47:09] this
[47:11] spirit
[47:12] trying to materialize itself in you it's
[47:16] trying to go from text to flesh
[47:20] and that which is trying to go from text
[47:24] to flesh opposeth and exalteth itself
[47:28] against God
[47:30] so now
[47:31] you decide what you want to feed on
[47:35] you think about that next time you're
[47:37] feeding on it
[47:38] brother Chris and I were talking today
[47:40] about
[47:41] we were talking about the Judgment
[47:42] striking the West Coast he was showing
[47:43] me a headline and I was just I pitched
[47:45] him a quote or brother I'm talks about
[47:47] judgment on the west coast because
[47:48] because God's going to sink Hollywood
[47:52] he's going to sink and he's going to
[47:53] sink for hundreds and hundreds of miles
[47:55] in circumference around it
[47:58] it's like it's like in the days of the
[48:00] Old Testament when you know when when
[48:02] these men rose up when Cara and Nathan
[48:05] rose up against Moses
[48:07] and God said to Moses tell the people
[48:10] you know identify yourself
[48:14] whoever is on the Lord's Side get over
[48:16] here near me quickly
[48:18] and whoever's not just stay right there
[48:20] near Cora and Nathan and that's so
[48:22] arrogant was Cora and dathan that they
[48:26] literally walked out in their tent door
[48:27] as if daring Moses let's see what kind
[48:30] of power you really got prophet
[48:33] now that's bad enough because the Earth
[48:35] ended up opening up and swallowing them
[48:37] alive that's not the sad part they got
[48:40] what was coming but what's sad is their
[48:43] families and their children and their
[48:45] wives and the people who they loved went
[48:48] down with them
[48:52] so let me say to parents today whoever's
[48:54] on the Lord's side gather under the word
[48:58] Hallelujah
[49:01] forsake these worlds this world for your
[49:04] family's sake
[49:06] if you don't love yourself enough to be
[49:08] spiritual love them enough
[49:13] so we find then that now so I'm going to
[49:16] read this in the ESV that we just read
[49:19] these first four verses of second
[49:20] Thessalonians 2.
[49:23] he says now concerning the coming of our
[49:25] Lord Jesus Christ and our being gathered
[49:27] together to him we ask you Brothers not
[49:31] to be quickly shaken in mind or alarmed
[49:33] either by a spirit or a spoken word or a
[49:35] letter seeming to be from us to the
[49:36] effect that the day of the Lord Has Come
[49:39] let no man deceive you in any way for
[49:41] that day will not come unless the
[49:43] Rebellion comes first
[49:45] and the man of lawlessness
[49:48] he's a man of sin see the King James
[49:50] says this man of sin this man of
[49:53] lawlessness is revealed
[49:55] can you give me a little further
[49:57] description sure the son of Destruction
[50:01] so
[50:03] who say brother Jason
[50:05] who is controlling
[50:08] the world the son of Destruction
[50:15] who opposes and exalts himself against
[50:17] every so-called God or object of worship
[50:20] so that he takes his seed in the temple
[50:22] of God proclaiming himself to be God
[50:27] so we find that this Spirit of
[50:29] lawlessness in the world today and
[50:32] this was a real burden on my heart in
[50:35] part one to
[50:36] because you remember that we read in in
[50:39] Joel's prophecy that
[50:41] everything that this Lawless man
[50:44] for six thousand years from Genesis
[50:48] has robbed God's family
[50:51] he has taken peace whenever he could
[50:54] from God's family who were entitled to
[50:57] peace
[50:58] he's taken Health from God's family even
[51:02] though they had Jehovah Jireh
[51:06] they had Jehovah's shalom
[51:09] they had you know a provider they had
[51:12] Jehovah Rafa the Healer
[51:16] they had the captain they hadn't they
[51:18] had the warrior king they had said canoe
[51:21] they had all of these they were entitled
[51:24] they were in unentitled people in the
[51:26] earth they're actually the only ones who
[51:28] were
[51:29] the whole world taught you know it's
[51:31] amazing to me that the whole world you
[51:34] know wants all kinds of things given to
[51:37] them and you know and I and I'm not not
[51:40] at all subtracting from the inhumanities
[51:43] that people have been treated you think
[51:46] about the Native Americans and what
[51:47] they've went through at the hands of of
[51:49] the white man who's the Rascal
[51:52] and history is replete with abuses of of
[51:55] minorities and but you know to to the
[51:58] Native Americans and they they make all
[51:59] these claims about their land and you
[52:01] this is my land and you've taken my land
[52:03] well I only know of one piece of land
[52:06] in the whole earth that actually people
[52:09] have a title deed to it
[52:11] and that's Israel
[52:13] Abraham and his descendants are the only
[52:16] one if you care about what the Creator
[52:18] did they're the only ones who the
[52:20] Creator said here's a section of land
[52:22] I'm going to give it to you
[52:26] now I get civilizations and people
[52:29] migrated and took over lands and then
[52:30] stronger people came in and took it
[52:32] that's that's the cruelty of sin
[52:35] you're not gonna there'll be no peace
[52:37] till Jesus comes
[52:39] see thank God for millennium
[52:43] find that
[52:48] find that and take the treasures of
[52:50] God's love from God's family he's still
[52:52] trying to do it today rest assured
[52:55] friends as much as you love the Lord and
[52:56] you come to church and I hope you do and
[53:00] but but just understand this that Satan
[53:02] is always trying to take it from you
[53:05] and that was the beauty to me of Joel's
[53:08] prophecy that the Lord said when this
[53:11] Lawless one has run his course I've let
[53:12] him run his course he that letteth will
[53:15] let I'm going to allow it till I get
[53:16] taken out of the way Lord you're going
[53:18] to get taken out of the way how's that
[53:19] going to happen my bride's going to go
[53:21] on a rapture
[53:22] so you're saying you are your bride
[53:25] correct
[53:26] she is him and when she goes all the
[53:29] grace for the Gentiles and mercy and
[53:31] blood go with her and then the Gentiles
[53:33] are plunged into and there's nothing
[53:35] left but judgment
[53:37] and so I I loved the prophecy because it
[53:40] talks about it the Kingdom time which is
[53:42] what I've been really zeroing in on
[53:45] we're at the time of the Cove the coming
[53:46] Kingdom I've read you the quotes out of
[53:48] the seventh seal where brother Brandon
[53:50] said it's been it's already been
[53:51] happening all around it's been happening
[53:52] all week I was waiting to see if my
[53:54] church would catch it you didn't you
[53:56] missed it but it's okay you weren't
[53:58] supposed to
[53:59] and that's how we were explaining last
[54:02] time that it was the infancy of the
[54:03] Bride her infant age that she didn't
[54:05] catch it and and an argument ensued for
[54:08] a decade and a half almost two decades
[54:10] after the prophet's gone is this are the
[54:11] Seals even is the seven seal open well
[54:13] if it's not none of them are
[54:16] and this is what we've learned in the
[54:18] sermons after the seals and having 60
[54:20] years to grow into a mature Pride
[54:23] and now it's uncontested we realize that
[54:25] and the problem the reason people
[54:27] couldn't see it and they they questioned
[54:30] it is because it took us a while to
[54:32] realize that the opening of the seventh
[54:34] seal was a happening behind flesh of his
[54:37] pride that it was the Mighty God
[54:39] unveiled and when you unveiled the
[54:41] Mighty God you unveiled his bride you
[54:43] unfailed his body no wonder you're a
[54:45] Believer no wonder you can't get away
[54:47] from it no wonder you love it
[54:50] because you're part of it
[54:53] you're listen this is not a false
[54:56] statement God's elect lady is just as
[54:59] much a part of God as this is
[55:02] it's all the same substance
[55:07] that's what the devil don't want you to
[55:10] believe
[55:12] and even if you do believe it he's
[55:15] trying every way to get into your
[55:19] business to keep you from enjoying it
[55:23] he's trying to corrupt and pollute you
[55:26] and keep your mind so carnal in the
[55:29] things of the world that you never even
[55:30] get to enjoy
[55:33] live out your whole life here as a
[55:35] believer
[55:36] overcome the deception which is which is
[55:39] the requirement of the age there's no
[55:40] other requirement upon us just to
[55:42] overcome the deception of the age and
[55:44] see the word of God and say Amen to
[55:46] every word does it mean we can always
[55:48] perform it God's going to have to
[55:49] perform it but I'm going to believe it
[55:51] and I'm going to pray and ask him Lord
[55:53] take whatever means necessary bring me
[55:55] to it
[55:58] see
[56:00] this Lawless one has no no hesitancy
[56:06] to try to get you to disbelieve the word
[56:07] of God
[56:09] he'll lie right in the face of God you
[56:11] think he won't lie to you
[56:15] Psalms 109 Psalms 109.
[56:19] uh catch these first seven verses
[56:23] hold not thy peace
[56:25] o God of my praise
[56:28] for the mouth of the wicked and the
[56:30] mouth of the deceitful are opened
[56:32] against me they have spoken against me
[56:33] with a lying tongue now this is David
[56:36] this is a Messianic psalm
[56:39] that's going to refer to the Lord Jesus
[56:41] when he comes they're going to hold a
[56:44] trial and they're going to lie on him
[56:46] okay
[56:47] verse 2 for the mouth of the wicked and
[56:50] the mouth of the deceitful are opened
[56:51] against me they have spoken against me
[56:53] with the lying tongue this happened at
[56:56] both of his trials
[56:59] it happened two thousand years ago at
[57:01] his trial and it's happening today when
[57:04] a prophet gave him a new trial said he
[57:06] didn't get a fair trial I'm going to
[57:07] give him a new trial
[57:09] Hallelujah and the prophet defended him
[57:11] but finally has to come back around
[57:13] again after he proves after brother
[57:16] Branham proved unequivocally that the
[57:19] word can be trusted and they still
[57:21] rejected it and he said very well that
[57:23] in the presence of the judge with
[57:26] prophetic Authority I indict this
[57:29] generation
[57:31] not a church not a denomination of the
[57:34] entire generation
[57:37] I indict you as guilty for the second
[57:39] crucifixion
[57:40] because again you're telling lies
[57:44] you're telling the world things like it
[57:46] doesn't matter how you live it's only
[57:48] what's in your heart
[57:50] you're telling the world all kinds of
[57:52] false teaching you're telling women they
[57:54] can do this and when the Bible forbids
[57:55] it men can do this when the Bible
[57:57] forbids it ministers can live like this
[57:58] when the Bible is clear
[58:01] all kinds of perverted lifestyles are
[58:03] okay that's a lie
[58:05] say oh it don't matter oh it matters
[58:09] it matters
[58:11] verse three they Compass me about also
[58:14] this is the day and hour you live in
[58:16] this is the second is that his second
[58:17] coming just like it was at his first one
[58:20] they compassed me about also with words
[58:23] of hatred
[58:25] and fought against me look at that
[58:27] Without a Cause
[58:30] that fourth verse just
[58:33] for my love
[58:35] they are my adversaries
[58:39] but I give myself unto prayer
[58:42] they despise them that do good again now
[58:46] and they have rewarded me evil for good
[58:50] and hatred for my love
[58:56] you know those who are
[58:58] condemned at the Judgment bar
[59:02] will be justifiably condemned because
[59:06] they refused the love of the son of God
[59:10] they didn't love the word
[59:12] brother Branham says you you love Satan
[59:16] so you say you love God
[59:19] said but your life proves you you hate
[59:21] God
[59:22] you love Satan your lifestyle proves it
[59:27] Steve
[59:28] so they're condemned very justifiably so
[59:31] verse 6
[59:32] set now a wicked man over him I think I
[59:35] read this in a past one or two sermons
[59:37] ago I just wanted to revisit it a little
[59:39] bit or maybe I was teaching it on a
[59:40] Bible study I don't rightly remember
[59:42] said thou a wicked man over him
[59:45] and let Satan stand at his right hand
[59:48] so that's a pretty bad place to be
[59:52] because now you're in a court of law
[59:55] you're in you're in the Heavenly Supreme
[59:57] Court
[59:58] the the the the
[1:00:00] Earth's over Armageddon is over the the
[1:00:05] Satan was bound A Thousand Years the the
[1:00:08] Millennium went for a thousand years and
[1:00:12] now we're coming back and they're going
[1:00:15] to they're going to be he's going to be
[1:00:16] loose for a little season and he's going
[1:00:19] to try to encamp the re the camp of the
[1:00:22] redeemed gonna encircle us because he'll
[1:00:23] have back all of his armies since the
[1:00:25] days of Genesis
[1:00:26] and you say why would anybody
[1:00:29] follow him because brother Branham said
[1:00:32] I mean that's a fair question why at the
[1:00:35] end of the Millennium what all these
[1:00:37] armies I mean they've been in hell
[1:00:40] and and the joke's over and it's on them
[1:00:43] why would they follow him again thinking
[1:00:47] I mean I would think in my mind I'm
[1:00:49] going to run to the king and beg for
[1:00:50] mercy I just got out of hell I'm going
[1:00:53] to go one more time Lord help please
[1:00:55] help me I'll I'll promise I'll serve you
[1:00:57] and instead they rally with Lucifer to
[1:01:01] try to kill the lamb again and kill all
[1:01:03] of his people again iniquity knows no
[1:01:07] bounds
[1:01:08] lawlessness once you give over to
[1:01:11] lawlessness it knows no bounds
[1:01:15] you go insane following that spirit
[1:01:20] why would the people
[1:01:22] rise up and be Resurrected
[1:01:25] and follow him again because it proves
[1:01:29] what a prophet taught us
[1:01:31] death changes nothing
[1:01:37] the same character you went down with is
[1:01:41] the same one you raise up with
[1:01:44] and they spent a whole lifetime
[1:01:46] following Lucifer and rejecting God so
[1:01:49] it's not strange at all that when they
[1:01:52] come back to to Resurrection they just
[1:01:54] go right on with what they had always
[1:01:56] been doing because it seems to them to
[1:01:59] be the right thing to do
[1:02:02] this is how Satan this is this is how
[1:02:06] powerful the spirit of the Lawless one
[1:02:09] is
[1:02:11] brother Branham says to
[1:02:13] his denominational Brethren many of them
[1:02:16] his dear friends
[1:02:19] November the 27th 1963 the world is
[1:02:22] again falling apart he'd already
[1:02:23] preached at one time he's coming at it
[1:02:25] again the world is again falling apart
[1:02:28] brother Branham says now this is he's
[1:02:30] going to show you that what the spirit
[1:02:31] of lawlessness this man of sin has done
[1:02:33] to the minds of people
[1:02:35] he says in different scientists
[1:02:38] wants to make themselves a great name
[1:02:41] each Nation wants to get its brainy man
[1:02:44] so now he's in science and education
[1:02:46] he's in politics
[1:02:49] they each Nation wants to get its brainy
[1:02:52] man we want ours we want the educational
[1:02:55] system in it we want a denominationalism
[1:03:01] because I mean what hypocrite wouldn't
[1:03:03] it'll let you do whatever you want
[1:03:05] and let you live anyway and still call
[1:03:07] yourself a Christian
[1:03:08] and still Pat you on the head at night
[1:03:10] and let you go to bed and sleep easy
[1:03:12] thinking you're fine and brother Brandon
[1:03:14] said on that day there'll be millions of
[1:03:16] people
[1:03:17] fodder for an atomic age who thought
[1:03:20] they were okay
[1:03:23] now watch what brother Branham exposes
[1:03:25] about the mind of God I this this blows
[1:03:28] my mind because I just
[1:03:30] I can't hardly get my mind wrapped
[1:03:32] around it
[1:03:33] this is what they wanted we want an
[1:03:35] educational system in it we want a
[1:03:37] denominationalism brother Brown says
[1:03:39] that's just exactly what we got that's
[1:03:42] what you did that's what you wanted
[1:03:44] that's what God gave you
[1:03:48] now what you're going to do with it
[1:03:50] after you got it
[1:03:52] because that denominationalism led you
[1:03:55] to the mark of the beast and now you're
[1:03:56] trapped
[1:03:57] but that's what you wanted
[1:03:59] that's what God gave you why'd God do
[1:04:02] that because that's what you wanted
[1:04:04] see that's what God gave you
[1:04:08] see now what you're going to do with it
[1:04:10] after you got it verse 7.
[1:04:13] when he shall be judged
[1:04:16] let him be condemned
[1:04:18] and let his prayers become sin that's an
[1:04:22] astonishing statement
[1:04:25] could you ever imagine prayer to God
[1:04:28] could be called sin
[1:04:29] [Applause]
[1:04:31] but but you understand and this is the
[1:04:33] point I think I made at some point
[1:04:35] previous teaching somewhere
[1:04:37] that when they come in Matthew 7 and
[1:04:40] they realize that their their you know
[1:04:44] their their whole thing of uh their
[1:04:47] whole thing of impersonating
[1:04:49] Christianity
[1:04:50] was working great in the earth and so
[1:04:53] they try that in heaven because they in
[1:04:55] the earth here's what they said they're
[1:04:57] going to be condemned and they're like
[1:04:59] whoa wait huh what do you mean well wait
[1:05:02] a minute we we preached in your name
[1:05:05] we did many mighty works are you kidding
[1:05:07] see and the King will just say to them
[1:05:10] there in Matthew 7 it goes along with
[1:05:11] Matthew 25 and Revelation 17 18 19 all
[1:05:15] the way through there especially uh
[1:05:17] getting over there in the 19 and you
[1:05:20] find that
[1:05:21] that what they what had worked for them
[1:05:24] in the Earth was to impersonate
[1:05:26] Christianity
[1:05:28] so when they get to heaven and they see
[1:05:31] the bride on the throne
[1:05:33] and they know they've missed that but
[1:05:36] they see the foolish virgin gaining
[1:05:38] eternal life even though they didn't
[1:05:40] show up with it
[1:05:42] then they go hmm let's try it again it
[1:05:45] worked in the earth out just impersonate
[1:05:48] Christianity
[1:05:49] and they say we did what they did we
[1:05:52] preached they preached we preached they
[1:05:54] built hospitals we built hospitals they
[1:05:55] did good we did good
[1:05:57] and the King will say to yeah but you're
[1:05:59] you did it with iniquity in your hearts
[1:06:03] because that plea that plea that they're
[1:06:05] making that's what a prayer is that's
[1:06:07] what praying is there that's why you you
[1:06:09] have to turn the legal term prayer for
[1:06:11] judgment
[1:06:12] that's actually a legal term a judge can
[1:06:15] give you he can find you guilty and just
[1:06:17] sending you to prayer for judgment
[1:06:18] meaning you need to go pray and ask God
[1:06:20] to forgive you they don't do it anymore
[1:06:21] but they used to do it
[1:06:24] probably some old Christian judges still
[1:06:26] handed out my sister got that one time
[1:06:28] for a speeding ticket
[1:06:30] and the judge felt she started crying as
[1:06:32] girls do
[1:06:33] and the judge felt sorry for her and and
[1:06:37] I hope she's not watching and she's just
[1:06:40] like I don't have any money just take me
[1:06:42] to jail just take me to jail and the
[1:06:43] judge is like get out of here get her
[1:06:45] out of here prayer for judgment prayer
[1:06:46] for judgment
[1:06:47] hahaha
[1:06:49] she quit crying pretty fast
[1:06:56] a prayer it's a plea hey please here's a
[1:07:00] prayer give me eternal life I see them
[1:07:02] getting it give it to me too but but the
[1:07:05] but the king will say to them he's not
[1:07:08] denying their Works he's simply saying
[1:07:10] they don't count because what you had
[1:07:13] iniquity in your heart and you're trying
[1:07:14] to play me you're trying to game the
[1:07:16] system
[1:07:18] you can't do it that way see so in verse
[1:07:21] 7 is coming to pass his prayer is sin
[1:07:24] because he's literally lying in court
[1:07:26] he's lying under oath in the courtroom
[1:07:28] of Heaven
[1:07:31] even in the face of the judge himself
[1:07:33] the I'm going to tell you something
[1:07:34] friends the Lawless one at the end time
[1:07:36] has unprecedented control over the minds
[1:07:40] of Fallen Humanity
[1:07:42] you're no match for him and your
[1:07:44] intellectualism you need to be born
[1:07:46] again of the spirit of God only the
[1:07:49] baptism of the Holy Ghost can help you
[1:07:53] he has unprecedented control over the
[1:07:57] minds of Fallen Humanity at the end time
[1:08:02] Matthew 7 23 I'm going to read it for
[1:08:05] you from the ESV
[1:08:06] and I'm going to read you several here
[1:08:08] right out of the ESV
[1:08:10] Matthew 7 23 then will I declare to them
[1:08:13] I never knew you
[1:08:14] depart from me you who practice
[1:08:17] lawlessness
[1:08:19] work iniquity
[1:08:22] see so why why am I correlating this
[1:08:25] because here's why
[1:08:26] because
[1:08:28] I I don't want you
[1:08:31] to think I'm trying to warn you against
[1:08:34] an action
[1:08:36] I'm trying to warn you against a person
[1:08:39] the man of lawlessness
[1:08:42] who's who's worshiped like God and
[1:08:44] controlling the minds of men
[1:08:47] see so when he's saying you practice
[1:08:51] lawlessness you worked iniquity you let
[1:08:54] the instead of letting the mind of
[1:08:57] Christ be in you you'll let the mind of
[1:09:00] the Lawless one control you amen
[1:09:04] Matthew 13 41 the son of man will send
[1:09:08] out his angels and they will gather his
[1:09:11] beautiful Matthew 13 as the church ages
[1:09:14] perfectly taught on it before the son of
[1:09:16] man will send out his angels is that the
[1:09:18] end and they will gather out of his
[1:09:20] kingdom all things that offend and those
[1:09:23] who practice lawlessness in other words
[1:09:25] the King James says them which do
[1:09:27] iniquity those who this is that's why
[1:09:29] the Millennium I'm not going to have to
[1:09:31] live with iniquity
[1:09:34] I'm not gonna have to live with Lawless
[1:09:36] people I'm not going to have to be
[1:09:39] around that
[1:09:40] I'm not going to have to worry about
[1:09:42] Neighbors playing loud music or people
[1:09:44] drinking and throwing beer bottles in
[1:09:46] nature and I can't even enjoy I can't
[1:09:48] even go down to the beach and and I have
[1:09:51] a right to do it my father built it it's
[1:09:53] for my enjoyment but half-dressed women
[1:09:55] prevent me from enjoying my inheritance
[1:09:58] I'm not going to have that in the
[1:10:00] Millennium brother Brandon said there
[1:10:02] won't be any pop-haired women there I'll
[1:10:04] guarantee you that there won't be any
[1:10:06] half-dressed females there won't be any
[1:10:08] men cursing and drinking and smoking
[1:10:12] thank God
[1:10:15] Matthew 23 28 even so you also outwardly
[1:10:18] appear righteous to men but inside
[1:10:20] he's warning these Pharisees
[1:10:23] outwardly you appear righteous to men
[1:10:26] but inside you are full of hypocrisy and
[1:10:29] lawlessness
[1:10:31] Matthew 24 12 and because lawlessness
[1:10:34] will abound the love of many will grow
[1:10:39] cold
[1:10:41] see
[1:10:42] our King James says iniquity
[1:10:45] because iniquity will abound when will
[1:10:47] it abound it's always been here
[1:10:49] Cain started with iniquity
[1:10:53] where's your brother how am I supposed
[1:10:54] to know am I My Brother's Keeper
[1:10:57] you liar you know exactly where he is
[1:11:01] how do you know because his blood is
[1:11:03] crying out to me from the ground
[1:11:06] take ownership of what you did
[1:11:09] that the world is so absent of that
[1:11:10] nobody owns it anymore
[1:11:12] big corporations cheat us all and poison
[1:11:15] us and kill us and and they pay a fine
[1:11:17] and they refuse they won't even admit
[1:11:19] guilt they make a deal with the
[1:11:21] government
[1:11:22] we're going to pay out you know 50
[1:11:24] billion dollars but we're not admitting
[1:11:25] guilt oh why are you paying on 50
[1:11:27] billion dollars well just to get out of
[1:11:29] it
[1:11:31] see
[1:11:32] nobody owns it
[1:11:34] everybody blames somebody
[1:11:37] it's not my fault
[1:11:39] it's not my fault that I got these
[1:11:41] complexes and these problems it's my
[1:11:42] it's my parents fault yeah that's who it
[1:11:44] is what's my preacher's fault that's
[1:11:46] that's what it is well this happened to
[1:11:48] me when I was a child and somebody and a
[1:11:50] spouse did this to me and somebody did
[1:11:52] that to me and this is why I can't be an
[1:11:54] overcomer nonsense
[1:11:56] you'll have more than enough power from
[1:11:59] on high to be free of everything that's
[1:12:03] contrary to God's word
[1:12:05] oh we should Rejoice over that friends
[1:12:07] we don't have to be bound
[1:12:11] if we stay bound it's because we allow
[1:12:13] it
[1:12:15] because lawlessness will abound the love
[1:12:18] of many will grow cold
[1:12:20] in Romans 6 19 I speak in human terms
[1:12:23] because of the weakness of your flesh
[1:12:25] for just as you presented your members
[1:12:28] as slaves of uncleanness this is when
[1:12:30] you were a sinner
[1:12:31] when you presented your members your
[1:12:33] your site your hand your take your touch
[1:12:36] your taste your smell your ears what you
[1:12:38] gave yourself to see just as you
[1:12:41] presented your members as slaves to
[1:12:43] uncleanness and of lawlessness leading
[1:12:45] to more lawlessness the Bible says
[1:12:48] iniquity unto iniquity see so now
[1:12:52] present your members as slaves of
[1:12:55] righteousness for Holiness friends I I
[1:12:58] could it'd be amazing to you today and
[1:13:00] I'm not even an expert in it but we
[1:13:03] could have an economics major come up
[1:13:04] here and you would be shocked at the
[1:13:07] power of compounding interest
[1:13:09] you'd be surprised how compounding
[1:13:11] interest can keep you in debt forever
[1:13:13] you can never get out of it you can find
[1:13:16] out how compounding interest can make
[1:13:17] you a rich person if you if you if you
[1:13:20] follow it logically and sensibly but the
[1:13:23] devil knows that
[1:13:24] the devil knows that iniquity if
[1:13:27] unchecked leads to more iniquity
[1:13:29] lawlessness when you follow the Lawless
[1:13:32] man you become a lawless person
[1:13:37] it's compounding interest
[1:13:39] and you find yourself 10 years deep as a
[1:13:42] Believer and still bound and trapped
[1:13:45] and and maybe you've got 98 freedom but
[1:13:48] there's a one or half or two percent and
[1:13:50] you feel more trapped now than when you
[1:13:51] 10 years ago when you gave your heart to
[1:13:53] the Lord why it's compounding iniquity
[1:13:56] it's iniquity leading towards
[1:13:57] compounding interest
[1:13:59] this is why there's such power of
[1:14:02] there's such overcoming power if you'll
[1:14:04] just start doing the little things
[1:14:06] if you'll just get a prayer life that's
[1:14:09] consistent if you just that simple if
[1:14:11] you just start coming to church whenever
[1:14:13] the doors are open if you'll start if
[1:14:15] you'll start putting the Kingdom of
[1:14:17] Heaven first in your life and let
[1:14:19] everything else be second third and
[1:14:21] fourth and fifth on Down the Line you'll
[1:14:23] be shocked it just won't take long down
[1:14:25] the road you'll have so much overcoming
[1:14:28] power you'll have so much spirituality
[1:14:30] you'll wonder man what was I ever
[1:14:32] thinking
[1:14:35] see that's how it can affect you
[1:14:39] and it's just the opposite when you
[1:14:41] don't do those little things
[1:14:43] second Corinthians 6 14 you good
[1:14:47] second Corinthians 6 14.
[1:14:50] do not be unequally yoked together with
[1:14:52] unbelievers
[1:14:54] that's pretty clear
[1:14:57] I mean
[1:14:58] I don't even know how to make that clear
[1:15:02] there there is absolutely
[1:15:05] young sisters if you're going after a
[1:15:08] worldly boy you're insane
[1:15:11] young men if you're if you find that
[1:15:13] some half dressed girl is appealing to
[1:15:16] you and you're going after that you're
[1:15:18] insane
[1:15:20] you've lost your mind
[1:15:24] amen he says do not be unequally yoked
[1:15:28] oh I'm going to lead them to the truth
[1:15:30] not likely
[1:15:33] I'm going to win them not likely
[1:15:35] in the Old Testament when somebody had a
[1:15:38] taking a Nazarite vow and anybody could
[1:15:40] take one it's just for a certain time it
[1:15:41] didn't mean a lifetime necessarily
[1:15:42] people didn't into a Nazarite vow man or
[1:15:45] woman it didn't matter and and if even
[1:15:48] accidentally something unclean touched
[1:15:51] them they were immediately polluted
[1:15:53] if even somebody died in near him and
[1:15:56] fell and touched them as they fell and
[1:15:57] hit the ground they're now polluted
[1:15:59] so so and that's what the prophet asked
[1:16:01] those priests he said if something is
[1:16:05] clean
[1:16:06] and it touches something unclean does
[1:16:09] the unclean become cleaner does the
[1:16:12] clean become unclean and they looked in
[1:16:14] the law and they said no whatever's
[1:16:15] clean if it touches the unclean becomes
[1:16:17] unclean
[1:16:19] see so you know God doesn't need you to
[1:16:23] do that God has a God knows who Your
[1:16:25] Divine mate is in the world and if you
[1:16:27] just stay humble God will bring them to
[1:16:29] you stay a Christian stay in prayer keep
[1:16:32] the Holy Ghost over you you'll attract
[1:16:34] the right one without it you'll attract
[1:16:36] the wrong one the Lawless man will see
[1:16:39] to that
[1:16:41] that's free it's not in my notes
[1:16:46] no charge
[1:16:51] do not be unequally yoked together with
[1:16:52] unbelievers for what Fellowship hath
[1:16:54] righteousness with lawlessness
[1:16:56] the King James says what Fellowship hath
[1:16:58] righteousness with unrighteousness and
[1:17:00] what communion has light with Darkness
[1:17:02] there
[1:17:05] II Thessalonians 2 7 for the mystery of
[1:17:08] lawlessness is already at work only he
[1:17:11] who now restrains will do so until he is
[1:17:13] taken out of the way that's the bride
[1:17:14] going in the rapture
[1:17:16] see that that's warnings now there's
[1:17:19] also a prophecy here and among many
[1:17:21] here's one that I picked out in Hebrews
[1:17:23] 1 9 because this is to the elect in
[1:17:26] Prophecy you have loved righteousness
[1:17:29] and hated lawlessness
[1:17:32] how many would say me Paul right here
[1:17:35] thank you Paul that's me I have loved
[1:17:38] righteousness I have hated lawlessness
[1:17:41] I've made mistakes but I hated it and I
[1:17:44] repented I haven't been perfect but I
[1:17:46] sure didn't stay there
[1:17:48] I found an altar somewhere I couldn't
[1:17:51] sleep I couldn't function I had to
[1:17:53] repent
[1:17:54] why do you keep doing that because I
[1:17:56] hate lawlessness I love righteousness
[1:18:00] therefore because you did that Therefore
[1:18:03] your God has anointed you with the oil
[1:18:07] of gladness more than your companions
[1:18:10] more than your fellows more than your
[1:18:12] peers more than your school comes more
[1:18:13] than your work Associates God has poured
[1:18:16] oil of gladness on you why because you
[1:18:19] loved righteousness
[1:18:22] that that this text do you realize this
[1:18:24] text is migrating to flesh do you
[1:18:27] realize that's coming to pass a worthy
[1:18:29] pride is being materialized in real time
[1:18:34] Hallelujah by the word
[1:18:38] I just say take that devil
[1:18:41] do your do your best do your worst
[1:18:43] however however you want to say it but I
[1:18:46] know this these words are becoming
[1:18:48] material in me
[1:18:49] this word is migrating in a a bride is
[1:18:53] being materialized in real time say
[1:18:55] what's life all about you're being
[1:18:57] materialized why are we still here
[1:18:58] you're being materialized why has it
[1:19:01] been this long because you're still
[1:19:02] being materialized what's going to
[1:19:03] happen when when I get fully
[1:19:05] materialized it's over we go home
[1:19:08] Friends Are Dead In Christ rise
[1:19:11] we which are alive and remain are
[1:19:14] changed
[1:19:17] see this is the time of the unsealing
[1:19:22] this is the time of the unsealing can I
[1:19:23] have 15 more minutes
[1:19:29] this this Kingdom time
[1:19:32] this breaking of the seals
[1:19:35] to reveal the the Mighty God and to
[1:19:37] reveal his family to expose the man of
[1:19:40] sin the man of lawlessness to separate
[1:19:43] light from Darkness so the bride can see
[1:19:45] where she's going
[1:19:46] so that an earth in darkness and gross
[1:19:49] Darkness upon people we still have a way
[1:19:51] we still have a uh we still have a
[1:19:53] perfect perfect guiding star
[1:19:57] that's leading us home
[1:19:59] see not in the first Exodus let me let
[1:20:01] me take a I'm going to turn a corner
[1:20:03] here
[1:20:05] the first Exodus when Israel's leaving
[1:20:08] Egypt
[1:20:10] God's family
[1:20:12] you say what's so important about
[1:20:14] brother branham's saying the kingdom is
[1:20:18] coming as it has been
[1:20:21] and it correlates it to materialization
[1:20:23] he correlates it to a leukemia
[1:20:26] case a leukemia girl or a boy and
[1:20:29] another case of a little girl and so
[1:20:31] he's he the the kingdom coming is not a
[1:20:34] metaphor
[1:20:35] it's not poetic license
[1:20:38] it's an announcement of something
[1:20:39] happening in real time
[1:20:42] it's something materializing
[1:20:45] and so then when we go back you say so
[1:20:47] then this is why brother Brandon would
[1:20:48] preach the Third Exodus because there's
[1:20:50] a first one there's a second one and
[1:20:51] there's a third one
[1:20:53] and the first one was Israel coming out
[1:20:55] of Egypt the second one was when Jesus
[1:20:57] came out of the Tomb and the third one
[1:20:58] is when the dead in Christ rise and we
[1:21:00] are changed and go home
[1:21:01] see
[1:21:03] so when we go back so brother Brandon
[1:21:05] wants to show the pattern this is this
[1:21:08] is what
[1:21:09] you'll see at the time of the Kingdom
[1:21:14] because in the first Exodus God's family
[1:21:17] was leaving to become a kingdom of
[1:21:20] saints in the earth that was the whole
[1:21:22] purpose that's why God called Abraham
[1:21:24] and he told him he'd have seed after him
[1:21:26] that's why Israel was established as a
[1:21:27] nation God took Israel
[1:21:31] as a holy people peculiar chaste people
[1:21:34] and he dropped them right down in the
[1:21:38] big middle
[1:21:39] of heathen Nations all around them
[1:21:42] now that's what the Millennium is going
[1:21:43] to be it's going to be Jerusalem
[1:21:45] becoming what it was intended to be in
[1:21:47] the first place
[1:21:48] it's going to become the Bastion of
[1:21:50] righteousness and Holiness and here's
[1:21:53] where the administration of God's laws
[1:21:55] and righteousness spread throughout the
[1:21:57] world that was what Israel was supposed
[1:21:58] to do they were leaving in the first
[1:22:01] Exodus they were leaving Egypt they were
[1:22:03] leaving the world to establish a kingdom
[1:22:05] of Saints and the Earth to be an example
[1:22:07] of all the heathenations around them
[1:22:09] which they failed to do that's why God
[1:22:11] sent him into captivity
[1:22:13] see
[1:22:15] now here here's I I said all that just
[1:22:18] to background here here's some here's
[1:22:19] what brother Brandon brought us
[1:22:21] and the token
[1:22:24] because
[1:22:25] people for
[1:22:27] 2000 years
[1:22:30] had been in churches
[1:22:32] and for 2000 years
[1:22:35] people had been preaching
[1:22:37] and Christianity
[1:22:39] spreading around the world
[1:22:41] and brother Branham has the audacity
[1:22:43] to come up and and here's the work of
[1:22:46] here's men in denominations the
[1:22:49] culmination of hundreds of years
[1:22:52] hundreds of years in some cases more
[1:22:56] than a thousand years
[1:22:58] of work
[1:23:01] and brother Branham is saying all that
[1:23:03] was great during the ages
[1:23:06] but now that the seals have been opened
[1:23:09] there's another step
[1:23:12] and if you want to go in the Rapture
[1:23:13] you're going to have to go to this next
[1:23:15] step
[1:23:17] see
[1:23:18] oh now watch this all Israelite all of
[1:23:22] them
[1:23:23] all Israelite families in the first
[1:23:27] Exodus had circumcised Fathers and Sons
[1:23:32] so they had the mark of of circumcision
[1:23:35] of being a Jew just like just like
[1:23:37] people said in message in Christian
[1:23:38] churches and say I'm a Christian
[1:23:41] and brother Bradham says you're you're
[1:23:42] just you're admiring the fine qualities
[1:23:44] of Jesus it's just a mental affair
[1:23:47] who wouldn't admire the fine qualities
[1:23:49] of Jesus a gentle truthful man who went
[1:23:51] about doing good who doesn't want to be
[1:23:52] who wouldn't want to be like that
[1:23:54] see
[1:23:55] and had powers of Heaven at his command
[1:23:58] and stay you know and and he he saved
[1:24:01] the whole world so who's not going to
[1:24:03] admire him
[1:24:05] but brother Graham said it's still just
[1:24:06] a mental thing it doesn't really you're
[1:24:08] not really allowing him to come in and
[1:24:10] change your heart that's why he came
[1:24:12] that's what the Holy Ghost is given for
[1:24:15] not to have you join a church or keep a
[1:24:17] code but to change your heart see
[1:24:21] say well I go to church I'm a Christian
[1:24:24] well all Israel all their Fathers and
[1:24:27] Sons are circumcised
[1:24:29] they all had all of them
[1:24:32] had Abraham as their forefather
[1:24:35] so here they are circumcised males a
[1:24:39] bloodline right back to Abraham
[1:24:41] absolutely dead to rights full legal
[1:24:44] rights to the Covenant
[1:24:49] is it
[1:24:51] but for the accident yes
[1:24:54] there had to be a fresh kill of a
[1:24:58] perfect lamb and that blood had to be
[1:25:01] put on display for the worldly Egypt to
[1:25:04] see
[1:25:07] so you could claim Christianity all day
[1:25:09] long at the Third Exodus but millions
[1:25:11] are going to find themselves fodder for
[1:25:13] an atomic age because they didn't have
[1:25:15] the token yes they said we believe in
[1:25:19] Jesus and yes they said in Christian
[1:25:21] churches and yes they sung gospel songs
[1:25:23] mostly sometimes yes they had Bibles
[1:25:25] that they read from
[1:25:28] but with brother Branham tried to
[1:25:30] implore them to say but if you don't
[1:25:33] have the token you're not going to make
[1:25:36] it
[1:25:39] see
[1:25:40] so so it was fine to be an Israelite
[1:25:44] being lineage of Abraham being
[1:25:46] circumcised dads and Sons
[1:25:49] but for the Exodus now it's coming to
[1:25:52] the kingdom you get me now it's it's not
[1:25:56] the ages now it's coming to the kingdom
[1:25:59] part where you've got you've got a a
[1:26:02] bride's time a Harvest Time a bride's
[1:26:05] age that's happening in the same last
[1:26:08] age not in eighth age but within the
[1:26:10] seventh age
[1:26:11] because the the layout of cnh was the
[1:26:14] very shortest one of all they rejected
[1:26:16] Christ long ago and put Christ down and
[1:26:18] the seals were opened that a prophet
[1:26:19] called us out of there that age is done
[1:26:21] and never Reviving again this is the
[1:26:25] time of the Bride who has the word and
[1:26:27] the word only
[1:26:29] see this is Kingdom time
[1:26:32] so you can't just sit in a church not
[1:26:34] even a message Church you can't have
[1:26:37] brother Jason as a pastor it wouldn't do
[1:26:39] you any good you've got to have the
[1:26:41] token it won't it won't get you in
[1:26:43] heaven just pushing play though you
[1:26:45] should push it every day
[1:26:47] but even that won't get you in a Rapture
[1:26:50] you've got to have the token
[1:26:54] they had to be identified with the lamb
[1:26:58] or brother Branham said
[1:27:00] the unconditional Covenant was annulled
[1:27:07] see brother Branham says now
[1:27:10] the second Exodus
[1:27:12] and the body the Bible says
[1:27:14] when Jesus came
[1:27:16] the bodies
[1:27:17] many doesn't say all many of the bodies
[1:27:21] of the Saints which slept arose and at
[1:27:25] his resurrection and went in with him
[1:27:27] but you notice it didn't say all
[1:27:30] see now here we are at the second Exodus
[1:27:32] now it's the time of the Kingdom
[1:27:34] Jesus is getting ready to establish his
[1:27:36] kingdom in the earth you know in in 50
[1:27:39] days he's going to establish the kingdom
[1:27:42] pilate asked him are you a king he says
[1:27:43] my if my if I was a king my subject
[1:27:45] would fight for me they're not here yet
[1:27:46] they will be and then they'll fight
[1:27:48] they'll take a stand but right now I'm
[1:27:50] all alone that's the way it's by Design
[1:27:53] but now the kingdom is coming at the
[1:27:55] resurrection
[1:27:56] the Holy Ghost is only 50 days out now
[1:27:59] waiting for Pentecost that's 50. that's
[1:28:00] Jubilee
[1:28:02] and so brother Branham comes here to
[1:28:04] this to the second Exodus and watch what
[1:28:06] he says this is that elected that bride
[1:28:09] when it says many of the bodies of the
[1:28:13] Saints which slap a rose not all but
[1:28:15] many see brother Brown says there is
[1:28:17] that elected that bride the Old
[1:28:19] Testament bride not all the Jewish
[1:28:23] Church come forth at that time
[1:28:25] all them now watch all of them made the
[1:28:29] same sacrifice
[1:28:31] all of them was under the shed blood of
[1:28:33] the lamb but there was an elected group
[1:28:36] and that elected group as soon as that
[1:28:39] event come that really believed in it
[1:28:43] with sincerity
[1:28:45] now I'm coming to the word overcome this
[1:28:49] is from how can I overcome
[1:28:52] he he now hold that see these that had
[1:28:57] really overcome
[1:28:59] sincerely making the same offering that
[1:29:03] the rest of them made but in sincerity
[1:29:07] overcome the things of the world
[1:29:11] not everybody at the time of the Rapture
[1:29:15] that saith Lord Lord will go in the
[1:29:18] rapture
[1:29:19] see when the propitiation correctly was
[1:29:22] made for them they were in Paradise
[1:29:24] until that until that play at that time
[1:29:26] when that time was made they had
[1:29:29] overcome and was resting sleeping see
[1:29:31] many bodies of those that slept in the
[1:29:33] dust he slept now we come to the Third
[1:29:35] Exodus
[1:29:36] so now you can see it's going to take a
[1:29:39] it's those those Jews in the first
[1:29:41] Exodus had to have the sincerity to say
[1:29:43] yes I'm yes I have a list Abraham and
[1:29:46] yes I have circumcision but a prophet
[1:29:48] has said I gotta have a token on display
[1:29:50] and I'm going to be sincere and do it
[1:29:54] and when they and because they did it
[1:29:56] they came out of the Tomb on the second
[1:29:58] Exodus with him now the third is upon us
[1:30:03] Sona it's upon us friends the Third
[1:30:05] Exodus is here
[1:30:06] let's make clear under the opening of
[1:30:08] The Seven Seals see because it
[1:30:10] identified the Mighty God Among Us it
[1:30:12] unveiled him and revealed his elect
[1:30:14] family and what is she called to she's
[1:30:16] called To The Feast of the word
[1:30:18] now watch in the last days he sent out
[1:30:22] this invitation
[1:30:23] he's he's preaching all through the
[1:30:26] gospels about his coming Kingdom
[1:30:29] and he he comes to Luke 14. let's find
[1:30:32] that Ethan Luke 14. I got to hurry I
[1:30:34] promised you I got four minutes to try
[1:30:35] to finish
[1:30:37] so he says in Luke 14 where we'll start
[1:30:40] somewhere down because
[1:30:43] um here Jesus is teaching on humility
[1:30:45] and he goes down and don't take the
[1:30:47] upper chamber wait till you be asked and
[1:30:50] or you get embarrassed and he goes down
[1:30:52] um
[1:30:54] um uh verse 15 Ethan
[1:30:58] and now Jesus finishes his sermon on
[1:31:00] humility and this man speaks up and says
[1:31:02] and when one of them sat that sat at
[1:31:04] meat with him heard these things he said
[1:31:06] unto him blessed is he that shall eat
[1:31:09] bread in the kingdom of God
[1:31:13] now when he makes that statement and he
[1:31:16] references the kingdom of God Jesus how
[1:31:19] blessed it'll be for the man that breaks
[1:31:21] bread with you in the kingdom of God
[1:31:23] Jesus turns and begins to teach then
[1:31:26] said he unto him now this is Kingdom
[1:31:29] this is you this is now
[1:31:32] this is right now this is what the
[1:31:34] message is
[1:31:36] then he said to them a certain man made
[1:31:38] a great supper and paid many and he sent
[1:31:39] his servant at supper time at supper
[1:31:41] time
[1:31:42] to say to them that we're bid and come
[1:31:44] for all things are not ready you believe
[1:31:46] that
[1:31:47] and they all with one consent begin to
[1:31:49] make excuse to first set into my ball a
[1:31:51] piece of ground I must need to go and
[1:31:52] see it I pray they have an excuse so
[1:31:54] here's a man letting business and
[1:31:55] commerce keep him out of the kingdom of
[1:31:57] God my and another said I bought five
[1:32:00] yoke of ox and I go to prove them I pray
[1:32:02] have me excuse another said I've married
[1:32:03] a wife now now domestic now family I got
[1:32:07] a job I got a career I got an education
[1:32:08] I you know I got to do this and I got to
[1:32:10] do that and I I got this to be a part of
[1:32:12] and that to be a part of and I I just
[1:32:14] don't have time to come to a feast
[1:32:16] [Music]
[1:32:18] but deceased you're declining is the
[1:32:20] Feast of the word
[1:32:23] say why is that so important because
[1:32:24] it's this word as you eat and you become
[1:32:27] what you eat is materializing
[1:32:30] Hallelujah so if you're only feeding on
[1:32:32] the world you're going to materialize
[1:32:34] the world it's that simple
[1:32:39] verse 22
[1:32:41] verse 21. so that servant came and
[1:32:43] showed his Lord these things
[1:32:45] the master of the house being angry said
[1:32:47] to his servant go out quickly into the
[1:32:48] streets and Lanes of the city and bring
[1:32:49] in hither the poor and the maimed and
[1:32:51] the hall and the blind
[1:32:53] servant said I mean listen friends
[1:32:55] when I look at that 21st verse
[1:33:00] the the
[1:33:01] only way that I know
[1:33:03] to cover
[1:33:04] all the streets and lanes and alleys and
[1:33:07] homes and places all over the world is
[1:33:09] with the modern technology we have today
[1:33:12] and that's why we leverage it that's why
[1:33:13] we use it
[1:33:15] because when that when this gospel not
[1:33:18] you see when Jesus said when this gospel
[1:33:20] so it's not the not the limited version
[1:33:23] of The Gospel in the ages it's the
[1:33:26] original when that gospel is restored
[1:33:29] and preached in all the world then
[1:33:32] cometh the end
[1:33:34] and that's where we're at friends where
[1:33:36] when we're spreading this gospel not a
[1:33:39] watered down Church age gospel but the
[1:33:41] original faith of the fathers
[1:33:46] and the serpent said verse 22 and the
[1:33:48] servant said Lord it is done as I was
[1:33:49] commanded yet there's room the Lord said
[1:33:51] unto his servant go out into the
[1:33:52] highways and hedges
[1:33:54] compel them to command that my house may
[1:33:56] be filled
[1:33:57] for I say unto you that none of those
[1:33:58] men which forbidden shall taste of my
[1:34:00] supper
[1:34:01] this word suffers a Greek word that
[1:34:03] means the chief meal of the Jews Greeks
[1:34:05] and Romans taken
[1:34:07] at or towards evening and often
[1:34:11] prolonged into the night hence usually
[1:34:13] an evening banquet
[1:34:15] this is why we've been here so long
[1:34:18] friends this is why we're still here
[1:34:20] because this banquet of the word has
[1:34:22] been going around the world for more
[1:34:24] than 60 years and it's run late into the
[1:34:27] night and it's run late into the evening
[1:34:29] but it's still the evening meal and
[1:34:32] we're still partaking of it don't worry

[1:34:41] Bride As she becomes more and more a
[1:34:43] living mystery

[1:34:46] sleeping Saints to resurrect
[1:34:50] oh yeah
[1:34:52] cause them to resurrect
[1:34:54] and we who are
[1:34:57] still here and slugging it out with the
[1:35:00] Devil

[1:35:04] becomes a living Tabernacle of Flesh
[1:35:08] that's me is that you today
[1:35:10] this word literally becomes a living
[1:35:13] Tabernacle of Flesh why because I'm
[1:35:15] slugging it out with the Devil oh many
[1:35:18] of them have already gone ahead of us
[1:35:19] they're already resting I'm still here

[1:35:30] to step up I'm going to pop him I'm here
[1:35:32] to tell you I'm gonna fight him and
[1:35:33] fight him and fight him until the saints
[1:35:35] come out and we which are alive and
[1:35:37] remain are changed in a moment in the
[1:35:41] twinkling of an eye
[1:35:43] that's what the kingdom is trumpeting to
[1:35:46] us that's what the seals were open for
[1:35:48] that's the coming of the Lord
[1:35:51] that you have arrived at it's been in
[1:35:54] motion for more than half a century the
[1:35:56] kingdom is coming the prophet said as it
[1:35:59] has been
[1:36:02] I'm so thankful to be a believer
[1:36:06] let us say Lord
[1:36:08] you know I I was I was the other day
[1:36:12] I was and I'll I'll just stop here
[1:36:15] let's give you a little testimony the
[1:36:17] other day
[1:36:19] I was up early
[1:36:21] I was studying and thinking about things
[1:36:24] and
[1:36:26] um
[1:36:27] sister Debbie I think was awake I'd
[1:36:29] she gets Coffee in Bed every morning and
[1:36:31] so I brought her her hot coffee after
[1:36:34] heat it because the the coffee pot don't
[1:36:37] make it hot enough for her
[1:36:39] and so I gave her coffee give her a
[1:36:42] morning squeeze ask her how she slept
[1:36:44] turn on her little fireplace and close
[1:36:46] her door so I can go back in there and
[1:36:48] set some more in the quiet morning
[1:36:52] and I started thinking and I started
[1:36:54] talking to the Lord
[1:36:56] and I and I just said Lord you know
[1:36:59] at the end of the day
[1:37:02] I I you know I I don't always find
[1:37:05] myself at the levels of Victory like a
[1:37:09] Envision seemed like I hard to be
[1:37:12] further ahead seems like hard to be
[1:37:14] stronger than him do you get do you get
[1:37:15] that friends you get that surely I'm not
[1:37:17] the only one
[1:37:19] you know I'm always fighting this
[1:37:21] perpetually perpetually if I'm not
[1:37:24] careful the devil I'll let the devil get
[1:37:26] a upper handle me and discourage me I
[1:37:27] always fighting this Spirit of uh this
[1:37:31] this feeling of underachieving
[1:37:32] underachieving always under achieving
[1:37:34] and and there's a balance to that and I
[1:37:36] realize I pray all the time ask the Lord
[1:37:37] to help me with that and this was one of
[1:37:39] those mornings where he decided to come
[1:37:40] help me
[1:37:43] and I I was just saying well Lord
[1:37:45] all I know is and I'm crying and I'm
[1:37:48] trying to trying to feel better about
[1:37:50] myself and I said Lord all I know is
[1:37:53] that the Bible says that if I've at the
[1:37:56] end of it all if I've done everything
[1:37:58] that has been asked of me I am to say I
[1:38:01] am the Lord's unprofitable servant
[1:38:05] because that's humility no matter what
[1:38:07] you accomplish brothers sisters young
[1:38:10] people no matter what you accomplish
[1:38:12] remember if you've done everything
[1:38:14] that's been asked of you your last will
[1:38:17] and testimony shall be I was the Lord's
[1:38:20] unprofitable servant Jesus led me all
[1:38:23] the way
[1:38:25] Hallelujah I look back over my life I
[1:38:28] regret my mistakes and I regret and I
[1:38:30] just say Lord I'm just your unprofitable
[1:38:32] servant and the Lord just began to talk
[1:38:34] to me and say
[1:38:35] yeah it was that that's by Design
[1:38:39] and I thought what what huh what's by
[1:38:42] Design so what do you honestly think you
[1:38:45] could ever repay me for all I've done
[1:38:47] for you
[1:38:49] you're always going to be on an
[1:38:52] unprofitable investment for me you were
[1:38:54] never going to be equal I I was never
[1:38:55] going to get back my investment
[1:38:57] I I
[1:38:59] pull life and blood for you you can't
[1:39:01] you can't begin to equal the price I
[1:39:03] paid for you
[1:39:04] I was always and I thought you mean I I
[1:39:08] was always going to be an unprofitable
[1:39:10] servant
[1:39:11] Heaven lord said of course said of
[1:39:14] course said you're not an investment to
[1:39:16] me I love you
[1:39:18] and I thought to myself and I ran in
[1:39:20] there I told my wife and I started
[1:39:21] crying she started crying and I said you
[1:39:23] know I thought about this I thought how
[1:39:24] much I love my wife and I thought yeah
[1:39:26] my wife I don't grade her
[1:39:29] she's not a she's not an investment I
[1:39:33] love her
[1:39:34] I go out and I I spend money in
[1:39:36] resources buying her stuff you know why
[1:39:38] so I can see that smile
[1:39:40] it's not about an investment it's not a
[1:39:42] balance sheet she's not a prospectus
[1:39:45] out of spent double to see that smile I
[1:39:48] just been triple to see that smile
[1:39:50] Hallelujah this this isn't a report card
[1:39:53] this is a marriage license

[1:40:04] your feet and raise up your hands say

[1:40:48] be an underachiever
[1:40:51] but I'm going to give you the message he
[1:40:52] gave me that's by Design
[1:40:56] so at the end of the day
