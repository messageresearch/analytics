[0:19] if you have an offering, you can know
[0:21] where I'm at. And I'll be singing.

[26:09] We're very happy to have all the
[26:11] visitors here with us. [music] Have our
[26:14] all of our church family here and uh all
[26:17] of the visitors with us here. Uh too
[26:20] many preachers to start calling names,
[26:21] but God bless you. We're [music] happy
[26:23] to have you here with us this evening.
[26:25] Visitors from near and far. You know, it
[26:28] reminds me that [music] that was the
[26:30] really the promise that God [snorts]
[26:31] made to Jacob when he the Lord stood
[26:33] above him, made that and [music] just
[26:35] recommitted that covenant to him and
[26:37] said, you know, from the west to the
[26:40] east [music] to the north to the south.
[26:43] Oh my, this message has pushed all
[26:45] around the world. Friends, you are the
[26:48] fulfillment of everything that God has
[26:50] promised [music] right here at the
[26:52] consummation of all the ages. Isn't that
[26:54] a great privilege? Amen.
[26:56] We're happy to have brother Donnie with
[26:58] us tonight. It's been quite a while
[27:00] since we've had him and [music] had it
[27:02] on our heart this year to run a number
[27:04] of meetings, maybe uh uh several
[27:07] actually. And I thought, you know, I'd
[27:08] like to have my old [music] friend come.
[27:10] Not my old friend, not old friend. Amen.
[27:14] But uh my old friend, Amen, from way
[27:18] back. And I've been knowing him a long
[27:20] time, knowing his family. We're [music]
[27:21] happy to have him and Sister Carol here
[27:23] with us. Amen. and one of Sister
[27:25] Debbiey's buddies and [music] so and the
[27:27] granddaughters I think are here. I'd
[27:29] make them raise their hand, but that
[27:30] would embarrass them and then my
[27:31] grandkids [music] would get on to me for
[27:33] that. So, but everybody knows who they
[27:35] are anyway. But, Amen. Turn around and
[27:37] look at each other and say, "God bless
[27:38] you. We're happy to have you here."
[27:40] Shake their hand. Say, "God bless you."
[27:43] Amen. [music] Praise the Lord. Brother
[27:45] Brown said, "There's nothing nicer,
[27:48] nothing better that you can say to
[27:50] someone than God [music] bless you."
[27:52] Think about that. I mean, if God blesses
[27:55] you, wow, you are in. There is nothing
[27:58] that can stand in your way [music] if
[28:01] you're under the blessing of the Lord.
[28:02] How many want that?
[28:04] Now, are you ready for the word?
[28:07] Man, your heart's all primed and ready.
[28:08] Did you come expecting?
[28:10] Oh, I'm here to tell you, the Lord's
[28:12] going to [music] meet an expectation. He
[28:15] absolutely will. Brother Random said he
[28:17] always keeps his appointments and you'll
[28:20] get exactly what [music] you expect.
[28:22] number of brothers and I met here last
[28:24] night, a whole gang of us, and just
[28:26] prayed. These meetings that you're in
[28:28] right now, we have committed it to God
[28:30] to come down and deliver to us the
[28:33] [music] word. The word has everything
[28:35] you'll need, friends.
[28:37] It has salvation. It has healing. It has
[28:39] the Holy Ghost. Amen.
[28:41] So, we want to invite Brother Donnie to
[28:43] come and take his complete liberty.
[28:46] Amen. Amen. Let's sing it again. Brother
[28:48] Anthony, we are standing. [music]
[28:50] We [singing] are standing.
[28:54] Oh yes. Come on, lift it up now.
[28:57] On holy [music and singing]
[28:59] ground.
[29:00] Sing it like you believe it. And I know.
[29:06] I know.
[29:06] Oh, I know.
[29:09] I know. [music] I know. They're all
[29:12] around.
[29:14] Hallelujah. [music]
[29:16] Come on. Make the bra now.
[29:21] [music]
[29:22] [singing]
[29:24] Oh Jesus
[29:27] now
[29:29] my friends cuz [music] we are save.
[29:36] Oh yes. Oh that's beautiful. [music]
[29:39] Ah you're singing. Oh, Jesus Christ.
[29:44] [music]
[29:45] We are
[29:48] [music and singing]
[29:56] [music]
[30:01] Oh
[30:04] [singing]
[30:05] [music]
[30:15] [music]
[30:17] [singing]
[30:19] Jesus. [music]
[30:24] Oh yes, father. [music]
[30:25] We are standing [singing] in his
[30:30] presence on holy [music]
[30:34] ground.
[30:38] Praise the Lord.
[30:41] Amen.
[30:43] We are so blessed
[30:44] to be able to stand in his presence.
[30:48] It's [music] real privilege for us to be
[30:51] gathered together while we're still in
[30:53] time.
[30:54] We can be [music] able to submit our
[30:56] hearts to the Lord and for him to be
[30:59] able to use us and help us [music] to be
[31:03] a blessing to other people. Eternal
[31:06] life, we know, is not living [music] for
[31:09] yourself.
[31:10] When we get there that day and the books
[31:12] are open, which the bride will not be
[31:15] [music] judged at the white throne, but
[31:18] all the things that we do for us, they
[31:20] won't even be listed.
[31:22] You did this, [music] you did this, you
[31:24] did this, you did this, you did this for
[31:26] you,
[31:27] but what'll [music] be listed are the
[31:29] things we've done for other people.
[31:33] I want [music] to do that, don't you?
[31:35] Amen. Amen.
[31:36] Let's turn tonight if you would to the
[31:38] book of Isaiah.
[31:43] Certainly count it a privilege to be
[31:45] able to be here with the with the
[31:46] saints. Brother Jason,
[31:51] just trust the Lord will meet with us
[31:53] this couple of days together as we've
[31:56] assembled in his presence.
[31:59] Isaiah chapter 14 verse 12.
[32:07] All the prophets up to this time knew
[32:10] that there was a prince of darkness.
[32:14] They knew that there was an evil that
[32:17] they were facing and dealing with. But
[32:21] apparently none of them was able to
[32:22] quite see what Isaiah saw.
[32:26] So what we're going to read tonight is
[32:28] quite astounding. It must have been to
[32:30] him as well. for the first man on the
[32:33] earth to be able to ride it this way.
[32:37] How art thou fallen from heaven.
[32:40] Oh Lucifer,
[32:42] the word Lucifer means day star or
[32:46] lightbringer.
[32:50] Lightbringer.
[32:52] How art thou fallen from heaven, oh
[32:55] Lucifer?
[32:56] Listen to another one of his titles. Son
[33:00] of the morning.
[33:02] How art thou cut down to the ground
[33:04] which did weaken the nations?
[33:06] Amen.
[33:07] For thou has said in thy heart, I will
[33:10] ascend into heaven. I will exalt my
[33:15] throne. Oh my goodness.
[33:19] So he is a king
[33:22] and he has a throne.
[33:25] I will exalt my throne above the stars
[33:30] of God. Now, I love this word in the
[33:33] Hebrew, stars. It means progeny or the
[33:38] Messiah's
[33:40] brothers.
[33:42] Hallelujah.
[33:43] Now, I wonder how in the world he knew
[33:46] the Messiah was going to have brothers
[33:50] above the stars of God.
[33:53] And I will sit also upon the upon the
[33:56] mount mount, excuse me, of the
[33:57] congregation
[33:59] in the sides of the north.
[34:02] Now, the prophet tells us it was in the
[34:04] north side of heaven that he started
[34:07] this great war.
[34:09] I will ascend above the heights of the
[34:12] clouds.
[34:14] How many wants to be like Jesus tonight?
[34:20] You're not the only one.
[34:22] Oh my
[34:24] Amen.
[34:25] This is what Satan said. I will be
[34:30] like the most high.
[34:32] But I guarantee you the way you say that
[34:35] is not the same way he looked at it.
[34:40] Look at his desire.
[34:41] What he wanted. He wanted to be God.
[34:48] I will be like the most high.
[34:51] Now, he wanted the sides of the north,
[34:55] but listen what he gets.
[34:58] Yet, thou shalt be brought down to hell.
[35:01] Amen.
[35:03] To the sides of the pit.
[35:07] That's right.
[35:07] You want the north, but you get the
[35:10] pits.
[35:12] You thought you was going to the pits,
[35:14] but God gave you heaven.
[35:17] Glory.
[35:19] Ain't that the mercy of God? Amen.
[35:22] Let me read you this also from Satan's
[35:25] Eden. I find this to be such an
[35:29] astounding statement. Brother Brham
[35:31] refers to this scripture now that we
[35:33] just read. And he said, "Now he said he
[35:35] would exalt himself above the most high.
[35:38] He would ascend above the clouds and the
[35:41] stars and he would sit there like God
[35:44] and be above the most high." Now this is
[35:47] the astounding part.
[35:49] and he has succeeded
[35:52] in carrying out his threats.
[35:58] He has certainly had a marvelous
[36:03] success.
[36:05] That's what I want to use for my thought
[36:07] tonight. A marvelous success
[36:10] in carrying out his threats. Now listen
[36:14] how he says that he was able to do it
[36:17] in carrying out his threats by the
[36:21] people
[36:22] letting him
[36:25] explain away in every age
[36:29] the value of God's promised word
[36:34] to that age.
[36:37] That's exactly he said how he's done it
[36:40] in every age. He explained it away.
[36:47] So when the people allowed him to do it,
[36:49] he explained it away. They took a
[36:52] substitute. They crowned him God.
[36:59] Well, I know one thing. I ain't doing
[37:01] that. Amen.
[37:04] Is that the way you feel in your heart?
[37:06] Amen.
[37:06] Now, none of us not most of the people
[37:09] of the world would never take a crown
[37:12] and set it literally on the devil's
[37:14] head. But when they allow him to explain
[37:17] away the value of the promised word for
[37:18] the age they live in,
[37:20] that's exactly they are helping him
[37:23] fulfill his ambition.
[37:26] How many like to be remembered tonight
[37:28] as we pray? God bless you. just hold
[37:30] your needs, your requests in your heart.
[37:32] [clears throat]
[37:34] Heavenly Father, we count it such an
[37:36] honor that we can be able to gather
[37:38] together here tonight in your presence.
[37:41] For truly we recognize in the presence
[37:43] of God, we can be forever changed.
[37:47] We come here tonight, no doubt, with
[37:49] different needs, different desires,
[37:52] different requests that we have. And the
[37:54] needs would be as diverse as the
[37:56] congregation that's assembled here.
[37:58] people from different assemblies. I see
[38:01] some from different states and no doubt
[38:03] their needs and their requests are so
[38:05] different one from the other. But we
[38:07] know that our God tonight is so mighty
[38:11] that you're able to hear each request.
[38:13] As a matter of fact, if millions of your
[38:15] children around the world were praying
[38:18] at the same time, all of them calling
[38:20] upon your name and you would start
[38:23] answering their request, I would not
[38:26] wind up with Brother Jason's answer.
[38:28] Brother Jason would not wind up with
[38:30] Brother Matt's answer. you would be able
[38:33] to send every individual exactly what
[38:36] they had need of. Hear them all pray at
[38:39] the same time and never mess up like
[38:42] FedEx and UPS does to our house.
[38:44] Right?
[38:45] That's what a mighty God we're serving
[38:47] tonight.
[38:48] Father, I pray you would help us. Speak
[38:51] to us. Help me to shut my mouth, Lord,
[38:53] to anything that would displease you.
[38:56] May these services be a benefit to your
[38:58] bride, your body. speak to us father in
[39:01] Jesus name we pray. Amen. God bless you.
[39:04] You may be seated.
[39:12] [clears throat]
[39:13] I have to say tonight
[39:16] I don't understand Satan.
[39:19] I don't understand his
[39:22] desire
[39:23] to love wickedness.
[39:27] I personally don't love wickedness, sin,
[39:31] evil, decrepitness.
[39:34] I've been in hospitals in different
[39:36] parts of the world and see people
[39:39] suffering with all types of diseases and
[39:42] sickness and um not only old people but
[39:45] children and yet I realize this being
[39:49] that we have described tonight, he
[39:52] actually delights. He delights in
[39:57] perversion.
[39:58] He delights in disease and sickness and
[40:03] heartache and trouble. Now, most of us
[40:06] would think, what kind of a being would
[40:08] that be? We cannot relate to such a
[40:11] thing, can we? That's certainly, would
[40:12] any of us delight to go out tonight and
[40:15] steal someone killed in a car wreck?
[40:18] Would we delight in seeing someone take
[40:21] a gun and blow their brains out? No. No.
[40:23] We that that makes us feel awful. We'd
[40:26] feel sick about it and think, "Oh, God,
[40:28] were they ready?" But yet this being
[40:31] that we have read about tonight actually
[40:34] delights in such stuff. He He loves
[40:38] sorrow. He loves pain. He loves cancer.
[40:42] He loves disease, suffering, heartache,
[40:46] trouble, anxiety, all the evil and the
[40:50] wickedness and the darkness that we see.
[40:53] He actually loves all of that
[40:56] now. But yet Isaiah said that he said in
[40:59] his heart that he wanted to be like God.
[41:02] Well, God certainly doesn't love that.
[41:05] Our father is not the author of cancer.
[41:07] Is that right?
[41:08] Now, we know that cancer uh is like all
[41:11] these other majes major diseases that
[41:13] they are fourthdimension diseases. And
[41:17] we know that when Satan actually
[41:19] preached to those angels in heaven and
[41:22] exalted himself above those angels that
[41:25] those angels which were made to to
[41:28] worship and created to adore and
[41:32] absolutely stand there before the throne
[41:35] of God with no sin. Now think of it.
[41:37] These beings never lied. They was not
[41:40] born in sin like we are. They never knew
[41:43] what corruption was. They never knew
[41:45] what a fallen nature was. They never
[41:47] knew what it was to get angry. They knew
[41:50] never knew what it was to be upset at
[41:52] anyone or to look at anyone and hate
[41:55] them and feel resentment or bitterness
[41:57] or anger. They never knew any of that at
[42:00] all. Like we were born that way, but
[42:03] they actually chose to go in that
[42:07] direction. Now, what was it that brought
[42:09] the impulse of the change upon these
[42:12] beings? Well, of course, we know that
[42:15] God created the angels in different
[42:17] spheres. There are seraraphims, there
[42:20] are cherubams, there are zoons. We read
[42:23] in the book of Ezekiel and we see some
[42:26] of those angels there that actually had
[42:28] four faces. We look in the book of
[42:29] Revelation and we see them that they
[42:32] would have a face on each side and they
[42:34] would turn. Then we see that there was
[42:36] four living creatures. So, we see all
[42:38] types of different degrees of these
[42:40] angelic beings. And we know that God of
[42:43] course in the beginning he was not even
[42:45] God which is object of worship. But the
[42:48] prophet tells us in Christ the mystery
[42:50] of God reveal he said to my opinion the
[42:53] first thing that he made was angels and
[42:56] then he became God because God is an
[42:59] object of worship. So he couldn't be God
[43:02] if there was nothing there to worship
[43:04] him. So whenever he created these angels
[43:07] and made them in degrees, they kept even
[43:11] when they fell, they kept that element
[43:14] of authority. Now we think tonight of
[43:17] those that we are battling against. And
[43:19] most of us, we say, well, the devil told
[43:22] me this and the devil told me that. I
[43:25] dare say most of us have probably had
[43:28] very few battles with the devil himself.
[43:32] Most of us deal with imps. What we deal
[43:36] with of those angels that are of lesser
[43:40] degree. Uh to be honest with you, I
[43:42] doubt that I've had very many uh one-
[43:45] on-one confrontations with the devil
[43:47] himself because I I dare say I don't
[43:50] rank high enough. And probably most of
[43:53] you don't either. But what now? Because
[43:56] we say, "Well, the devil said this and
[43:58] the devil said that and the devil's been
[44:00] fighting me." Now, in one way for us to
[44:02] say it that way, we are exactly right.
[44:05] Because when these angels chose to go
[44:08] with him, they took on his kingdom. They
[44:11] took on his nature and therefore they
[44:15] took on his name and title. Now, when
[44:18] you look at that in the reverse on the
[44:21] other side, when we become a part of the
[44:23] kingdom of God, we take on his kingdom,
[44:26] his nature, his name, everything. Is
[44:30] that right? What? God also has a
[44:33] purpose, but it's so different from this
[44:35] one. Now, I find it amazing that when
[44:38] the Lord Jesus comes that the Lord Jesus
[44:41] has no problem in identifying Satan and
[44:45] giving him his his position and actually
[44:49] his due authority on the earth. Now,
[44:52] there's many differences, of course,
[44:54] between God and the devil, but one of
[44:56] them I'd like to point out tonight is
[44:58] that the devil will never let his
[45:01] followers or his children ever see how
[45:05] great, how wonderful, how majestic, how
[45:08] powerful that our God is.
[45:11] He'll never do that. He will blind them
[45:13] to the grace, to the mercy, and also to
[45:16] the justice and the judgment of our God.
[45:20] He will never let them actually see what
[45:22] God is going to bring them to. If they
[45:25] did, many of them would come to God
[45:27] simply out of fear. But the devil will
[45:30] never allow them to see it. So he will
[45:32] blind their eyes according to second
[45:34] Corinthians. Is that right? Whom the God
[45:36] of this world blinded their eyes. So
[45:38] he'll never let them see that. But the
[45:41] Lord Jesus has no problem in letting us
[45:45] see everything that Satan is. He has no
[45:49] problem in letting us see that Satan is
[45:53] truly a powerful foe. Now, if we believe
[45:56] tonight that Satan is not a powerful
[45:58] foe, we're in a heap of trouble already.
[46:01] So, the Lord has no problem in allowing
[46:04] us to see from one boundary to the other
[46:07] everything that Satan can do. Much of
[46:10] the Bible is written actually of what
[46:12] Satan has been allowed to do to and
[46:15] against the people of God. Look at the
[46:17] book of Job. It shows us the epitome of
[46:19] the life of a man that was a man who
[46:22] loved God with all of his heart. He he
[46:24] feared God, disputed evil, which meant
[46:26] that he turned away from evil and wrong.
[46:28] And the Bible does not hide all that
[46:31] Satan did to him. It does not hide that
[46:34] Satan, when he's allowed by God, can
[46:36] attack our body. He can attack our
[46:38] family. He can attack our home. NOW, WHY
[46:41] DIDN'T GOD HIDE that from his people?
[46:43] Isn't he afraid that some of his people
[46:45] would read that and they would not want
[46:47] to serve him? No. The Lord has no
[46:50] problem in showing you and I absolutely
[46:53] everything from one side to the other
[46:55] side of the spectrum what Satan can do
[46:59] because we can look at that and see him
[47:01] as he is and come right back and say,
[47:04] "But devil, I am not afraid of you and
[47:07] I'm not afraid of what you can do to
[47:10] me." Because God does not have to blind
[47:15] us in order to get us to serve him. The
[47:18] Lord Jesus does not introduce his
[47:20] kingdom in such a way that he offers
[47:23] only the good. Now the social modern
[47:25] Leodysian preachers, they want to preach
[47:27] it that heaven is just, oh, everything's
[47:30] right before you. It's all good. It's
[47:31] all wonderful. No burden, no trouble.
[47:33] You know how they are, all the smiley
[47:35] preachers, and it's all blessings and
[47:37] good and there's nothing hard ever going
[47:39] to come your way. That man's lying to
[47:41] you.
[47:42] As a matter of fact, the Lord Jesus
[47:45] talked about your cross more than he
[47:47] talked about his own. Have you ever done
[47:49] a study on the four gospels? And you'll
[47:51] find out all of them, Matthew, Mark,
[47:53] Luke, and John, that the Lord Jesus
[47:55] mentioned more about your burdens and
[47:58] your cross than he did his own. Would
[48:01] wouldn't that run people away? Well, it
[48:03] might run some people away, but it won't
[48:05] run seed away. That's exactly right.
[48:08] because they will look at it. He has no
[48:11] problem in telling them you're going to
[48:12] be burdened. If you choose me, if you
[48:15] live for me, the people's going to hate
[48:17] you. AS A MATTER OF FACT, HE TOLD US
[48:19] YOU'RE GOING to be persecuted. You're
[48:20] going to be despised. WELL, PRAISE THE
[48:22] LORD. WHY? Because he does NOT HAVE TO
[48:25] HIDE this from his people and give them
[48:29] something which is false and a facade of
[48:32] something that does not exist. But what
[48:35] will Satan do? He will blind his.
[48:38] Because even if they ever saw a glimpse
[48:41] of the mercy of God, IF THEY'RE NOT EVEN
[48:44] BRIDE, many of them would come to him if
[48:47] they ever just caught a glimpse of God's
[48:49] mercy.
[48:51] Now, as a bride of Christ, we have no
[48:53] problem in believing that the love of
[48:56] God is so great and so bountiful that it
[48:59] it poured out from the lamb's book of
[49:01] life, which is God's personal diary of
[49:04] his family, and is spilled over into the
[49:07] book of life, which the foolish virgin
[49:10] and all them have their name written in.
[49:12] And there will be people that will come
[49:14] to the Lord who are not of his DNA, who
[49:17] are not of his genes, but they will
[49:20] come. Whosoever will, let them come and
[49:23] take of the water of life freely. Well,
[49:24] that don't make me mad, does it you?
[49:26] THAT'S THE GRACE OF OUR GOD. AND THE
[49:29] love and the mercy of God will spill
[49:31] right over to them. And many of them
[49:33] will walk up that day and they will have
[49:35] accepted the Lord as their savior.
[49:37] They'll not be bride. They'll not live
[49:39] inside the city. Why? They did not live
[49:41] inside the pyramid city right now
[49:43] through the church ages. You see, when
[49:46] you die and leave this world, you're
[49:48] going into the city which mirrored where
[49:51] you were in this life. What was it? You
[49:54] lived in this pyramid-shaped city
[49:57] according to the seven dispensations of
[49:59] God's grace. Is that right?
[50:01] Now, IN THIS, BUT SATAN will blind the
[50:04] eyes of the people. He tries to do the
[50:06] same thing to you and I when we go
[50:08] through trials and tests. Well, if
[50:09] you're a son of God, if you're a
[50:11] daughter of God, why does God let you go
[50:13] through this and God let you go through
[50:14] that and you know you love him and all
[50:16] you'd have to do is just look your way
[50:19] and drive all your troubles away. Don't
[50:21] tell me he don't try to use that on you
[50:23] because he does. He did on brother
[50:25] Brandham when brother Brandham stood
[50:26] there and there laid his wife and there
[50:28] lady's child and the devil told him HE
[50:30] SAID ALL YOU'D HAVE TO do is look this
[50:32] way and you know people say well the
[50:34] devil can't tell the truth. I beg to
[50:36] differ with you. Brother Bram said
[50:38] everything the devil told him was the
[50:40] truth.
[50:41] Well, praise the Lord. That's exactly
[50:44] right. AND HE SAID ABOUT THE TIME I WAS
[50:46] READY TO SAY, "WELL, IF THAT'S the way
[50:48] he is, I'll never serve him again." But
[50:51] he said something down inside of me
[50:54] raised up and said, "The Lord gives and
[50:56] the Lord takes away. Blessed be the name
[51:00] OF THE LORD."
[51:02] BUT UNLIKE GOD, SATAN HAS to blind his
[51:05] subjects in order to KEEP THEM. SO HE
[51:08] MAKES MANY OF THEM believe that there IS
[51:11] NO GOD. HE MAKES MANY of them believe
[51:14] that there's various ways that you can
[51:16] get to God. SO YOU CAN GET TO GOD
[51:19] THROUGH CENTINUISM. You can come to God
[51:21] through to talism, through communism,
[51:24] all these different things. Sikhs and
[51:26] chains and Buddhists and all that.
[51:28] Several years ago, I stood in in Durban,
[51:30] South Africa, and I went to an Indian
[51:32] festival there with some of the
[51:33] brothers, and they wanted to take me and
[51:35] show me how they do. Uh the last count I
[51:37] had, the Hindus had a total of 33
[51:40] million gods. So, I'm so glad I just got
[51:42] one. Cuz in the middle of trouble, I
[51:45] wouldn't know which one to talk to,
[51:46] would you? You pray to one god for a
[51:48] belly ache, you pray to another god for
[51:50] an ear ache, you pray to another god for
[51:52] a split up finger. I'm glad I've got one
[51:55] God and his name is one. SO THEY WANTED
[51:57] TO SHOW ME HOW THEY DID WHAT it was so
[52:00] unusual to me of course AND YET I SAW
[52:02] these people as they were gathering
[52:04] together and they would get a form a
[52:06] little tiny circle and all of them had a
[52:08] little small set of symbols real tiny
[52:10] things and they go to standing there and
[52:12] playing those things and they'd go to
[52:14] chanting and chanting and chanting and
[52:16] Hindu and then they would just go to
[52:18] jumping and screaming and hollering and
[52:20] shouting and the person standing in the
[52:23] middle they would stand there and they'd
[52:25] surround this individual and they would
[52:26] go to chanting and shouting and
[52:28] screaming and just all this emotional
[52:31] work up. Now, we believe in emotion, but
[52:33] it takes more than emotion to be able to
[52:35] get the attention of God.
[52:37] That's right. NOW, I WATCHED THEM AS
[52:40] THEY WOULD do this, I actually videoed
[52:41] and I've still got it. AND THEY STOOD
[52:43] THERE AND whenever this individual was
[52:46] ready for what was fixing TO HAPPEN,
[52:48] EACH ONE OF THEM, and there were tens of
[52:50] thousands of people that were there, and
[52:52] there was little small huddles, say a
[52:54] huddle there, and one over here, and one
[52:55] over there, and one over here, and one
[52:57] over there, and you could tell when they
[52:59] were ready. Let me tell you what I mean
[53:01] by that. They were going to take a big
[53:03] long pin about this long. And they would
[53:06] start it at the tip of their tongue and
[53:08] they would weave that pin through their
[53:10] tongue in and out, in and out. And they
[53:13] would also take big long grab hooks, we
[53:16] call them, uh, big old fish hooks, and
[53:18] they would stick them in the backs of
[53:20] these worshippers. And then they would
[53:22] tie strings and they would pull a little
[53:25] chariot looking thing, pretty goodized
[53:27] cart, uh, with all these images of these
[53:30] gods. Now they would hook them in their
[53:32] backs and they would pull it and the
[53:34] skin of their backs would pull out from
[53:36] their body.
[53:37] NOW HERE THEY WOULD WALK down through
[53:39] there and they WAS SO OUT OF IT. NOW
[53:42] WHENEVER THEY would get ready, as I
[53:44] said, THEN THEY WOULD LET OUT a blood
[53:46] curdling scream. Well, then these people
[53:49] knew they were ready to be pierced and
[53:52] to have all these pins and all all these
[53:55] things. They would actually take some of
[53:56] these grab hooks and run them into
[53:58] grapefruit and oranges and apples and
[54:00] bananas and they'd hang them all over
[54:03] their bodies. You've seen it, Brother
[54:04] Jason. It's just unbelievable. Now, you
[54:06] know, to most Americans, OH, THEY SAY,
[54:08] "OH, THAT'S OF THE DEVIL." WELL, SURE,
[54:11] we can recognize that as the devil, but
[54:13] how many of them will go to a
[54:15] denominational system which substitutes
[54:18] their denominational teaching for God's
[54:20] word? But will they believe that's the
[54:22] devil? No, they sure won't. But
[54:24] according to what Jesus said in Mark 7,
[54:26] how be it in vain do they worship me
[54:29] teaching for doctrine the commandments
[54:31] of men. So you say whether it's
[54:34] Protestant or Catholic or even message
[54:36] people if they leave the word it's still
[54:38] vain worship. WELL, WHO DOES IT GO TO?
[54:41] THE God of this evil age.
[54:43] NOW HE'S VERY peculiar in the way that
[54:46] he looks at this. Now, you know, if you
[54:49] see us after the service tonight and you
[54:51] walk up to me and you say, "Oh, brother
[54:53] Donnie, God bless you. Good to see you,
[54:54] brother." And then you turn around to
[54:56] Brother Jason and say, "Brother Jason, I
[54:58] really enjoyed that sermon you preached
[54:59] tonight, brother. Thank you for studying
[55:01] and applying the word." And you're going
[55:03] I'm going to look at you and he's going
[55:04] to look at you and we're going to look
[55:05] at each other and say, "My goodness,
[55:07] what in the world?" I mean, I'm not want
[55:09] no credit or nothing like that, but at
[55:10] least just a little pat on the back or
[55:12] something. You mean you're going to give
[55:13] it to him? I'm the one who done all this
[55:15] studying. I'm the one who's been nervous
[55:17] all day long. I'm the one that's a
[55:19] basket case and you're going to give
[55:21] praise to him. NOW, YOU SEE, THE DEVIL
[55:23] is so wound up in himself that he cannot
[55:27] heal. He cannot raise the dead. HE HAS
[55:30] NO HEAVEN to offer you.
[55:32] AS A MATTER OF FACT, HE DOESN'T EVEN
[55:34] love his own family.
[55:37] He don't even love HIS OWN KIDS. HE
[55:40] DON'T EVEN LOVE those that he's taken to
[55:42] hell with him. And yet he will take
[55:45] diverted worship which people are
[55:47] saying, "Oh Lord Jesus, oh Lord Jesus,
[55:51] Lord God, I worship you." But he can
[55:53] only receive it as it's offered up
[55:55] through the revealed word of the hour
[55:57] you're living at. If not, it is VAIN
[56:00] WORSHIP. SO WHERE DOES THAT WORSHIP GO?
[56:02] It's diverted over to this being and he
[56:06] will gladly take it.
[56:08] I think I know brother Jason well enough
[56:10] to know that brother Jason is not going
[56:12] to stand there very long and say hey
[56:14] brother sister you need to TELL BROTHER
[56:15] DONNIE THAT I WASN'T the one that
[56:17] preached sure I've been praying for him
[56:19] and yeah I've been under the load of the
[56:20] medium as a PASTOR YOU ARE BUT BROTHER
[56:23] DONNIE IS THE ONE THAT LABORED THAT BUT
[56:24] SATAN WANTS PRAY SO MUCH
[56:28] THAT HE WILL take it even THOUGH IT HAS
[56:30] the name of the Lord Jesus attached to
[56:34] it
[56:36] you're talking ABOUT A FRIENDS,
[56:39] YOU TALKING [screaming] ABOUT ONE I HOPE
[56:40] YOU UNDERSTAND THAT GOD never created
[56:44] sin. Sin is not a creation. But sin is a
[56:50] perversion.
[56:51] Now when we read this in Isaiah that
[56:54] SATAN SAID, "I WILL." THIS IS actually
[56:58] the beginning of sin IN THE HEAVENLIES.
[57:02] NOW WHERE DID IT COME FROM? EXALTATION
[57:06] of a will above God's will.
[57:09] Now remember THE PROPHET TELLS US SIN
[57:11] DID not start on the earth but it
[57:15] actually started in heaven.
[57:18] WELL WHO? WELL OF COURSE LUCIFER. NOW
[57:20] REMEMBER ACCORDING TO EZEKIEL CHAPTER 28
[57:24] THE BIBLE TELLS US SON OF MAN TAKE UP a
[57:26] lamentation against the king of Tyrus.
[57:29] Now, this was actually a a natural king
[57:31] in this time frame, BUT THE DEVIL HAD SO
[57:34] GOT THIS MAN. HE'S a forerunner of of
[57:36] anti antioxes, of course, in the Roman
[57:39] Empire and also a forerunner of the
[57:41] antichrist in the last days in 2
[57:43] Thessalonians where it will be the man
[57:45] of sin that will be revealed. So, here
[57:47] was a king on the earth in the time of
[57:50] Ezekiel. And Satan had been able to take
[57:52] over this king's body. AND GOD WAS ABLE
[57:55] TO USE THE prophet to speak to the
[57:57] person of Satan inside THIS KING. BUT
[58:00] YET WHAT GOD SAYS ABOUT this king,
[58:02] there's no way that it was this KING
[58:04] BECAUSE HE SAID, "THOU WAS IN THE GARDEN
[58:06] OF GOD. EVERY PRECIOUS STONE WAS THY
[58:09] COVERING, THE CARBUNCLE, THE TOPAZ." And
[58:12] it goes on to mention all of these
[58:13] things. AND HE SAID, "THOU ART THE
[58:16] ANOINTED CHERUB, and I HAVE SET THEE
[58:19] SALT." NOW, ACTUALLY, WHEN YOU LOOK that
[58:20] up in the Hebrew, you realize that
[58:22] anointed cherub was the one who stopped
[58:25] the approach. So, the prophet TELLS US
[58:27] IN QUESTION EXODUS 19:59 THAT SATAN WAS
[58:30] ACTUALLY GOD'S RIGHT-HAND man to
[58:33] fellowship.
[58:35] Now, not when his name was Satan or not
[58:37] WHEN HE FELL, BUT IN HIS ORIGINAL
[58:40] CREATION. OH, I love to wish the devil a
[58:44] happy birthday every NOW AND THEN JUST
[58:46] FOR THE sake of letting him know I know
[58:50] his days are numbered BECAUSE YOU SEE,
[58:54] OH MY, WHEN THERE IS NO MORE DEVIL, YOU
[58:58] STILL WILL BE
[59:00] BECAUSE EVERYTHING THAT HAD A BEGINNING
[59:02] [screaming]
[59:03] WILL HAVE AN END.
[59:05] OH, GLORY. AND THE LORD TOLD HIM, "THOU
[59:08] WAS PERFECT IN THE DAY THAT THOU WAS
[59:11] CREATED until iniquity was found in
[59:15] thee." SO YOU SEE, HE HAD A DAY. HE
[59:17] STARTED, HE WILL HAVE A DAY. HE WILL BE
[59:20] ANNIHILATED. AND NO DOUBT HE WILL BE THE
[59:23] LAST CREATURE WHICH WILL BE ANNIHILATED
[59:27] IN THE LAKE OF FIRE.
[59:30] OH, HAPPY DAY. HAPPY DAY. BUT I'M NOT
[59:33] GOING TO WAIT TILL HE'S DESTROYED TO
[59:36] REJOICE. [screaming] I THINK I'LL GO
[59:38] AHEAD AND DO IT RIGHT NOW. BECAUSE
[59:40] ACCORDING TO THE WORD OF GOD, HE
[59:42] [screaming] WILL BE DESTROYED.
[59:46] ALL THAT SICKNESS THAT YOU'RE BATTLING
[59:48] [screaming] TONIGHT, ONE DAY IT WILL
[59:50] CEASE TO EXIST. THERE WILL BE NO MORE
[59:53] CANCER. THERE WILL BE NO MORE HEARTACHE.
[59:56] THERE WILL BE NO MORE TROUBLE. AND YOU
[59:59] WILL BE WORSHIPING ALMIGHTY GOD WHILE
[1:00:02] THE CEASELESS AGES ROLL ON. WHEN THERE
[1:00:05] IS NO MORE TROUBLE, WHEN THERE IS NO
[1:00:08] MORE ANXIETY, YOU STILL WILL BE.
[1:00:16] [sighs]
[1:00:19] So every now and then when he goes to
[1:00:20] aggravate me, I'll say, "Give me a key.
[1:00:23] Give me a key. [gasps] Happy birthday
[1:00:26] to you,
[1:00:29] devil. Happy birthday to you. I hope I'm
[1:00:34] part of that committee that throws you
[1:00:37] in there. The lake, too.
[1:00:41] [applause]
[1:00:45] Watch the Lord Jesus in St. John 12:31.
[1:00:48] Now is the judgment of this world. Now
[1:00:51] shall the prince of this world be cast
[1:00:55] out. Now this is before he even died. SO
[1:00:58] JESUS DEATH WOULD BRING down and destroy
[1:01:01] the kingdom of Satan. And Jesus is
[1:01:04] saying it as if though it's already done
[1:01:07] BEFORE HE'S EVEN ACHIEVED. I WANT YOU TO
[1:01:10] NOTICE JESUS DOES NOT CALL him a god,
[1:01:16] but Jesus calls him a prince.
[1:01:21] a prince.
[1:01:22] Now, what's amazing to ME IS BEFORE THE
[1:01:25] CROSS and the power of the cross, he was
[1:01:29] called a prince,
[1:01:31] but after the cross, he's actually going
[1:01:34] to be called a god.
[1:01:36] Wow.
[1:01:39] So, when you get prayed for and you get
[1:01:41] worse, don't look at that.
[1:01:43] You look at the promise of God. By his
[1:01:46] stripes, I AM HEALED.
[1:01:49] NOW, HOW IS IT THAT SATAN being a prince
[1:01:52] BEFORE THE CROSS BECOMES A GOD AFTER THE
[1:01:56] CROSS?
[1:01:57] AMEN.
[1:02:01] Notice again in St. John 14:30,
[1:02:05] hereafter I will not talk much with you,
[1:02:08] FOR THE PRINCE OF this world cometh and
[1:02:12] hath nothing in me.
[1:02:15] St. JOHN 16:11 OF JUDGMENT BECAUSE THE
[1:02:18] PRINCE of this world is judged. Now
[1:02:23] Jesus hadn't even broke his back yet,
[1:02:25] but he's speaking it as if though it has
[1:02:28] already happened.
[1:02:30] Now you KNOW THE LORD JESUS WANTS HIS
[1:02:32] CHILDREN to be able to understand. We
[1:02:35] know that even in warfare, I I've
[1:02:38] studied war for years and years. I I I I
[1:02:41] can get myself see a lot of parallels in
[1:02:43] between natural war and spiritual war.
[1:02:46] You understand the civil war, the
[1:02:48] Napoleonic wars and many of those wars
[1:02:50] that were fought hundreds OF YEARS AGO
[1:02:52] ARE STILL STUDIED TO THIS DAY IN
[1:02:54] COLLEGES of war. THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND
[1:02:57] HOW THIS BATTLE WAS LOST at a certain
[1:02:59] place when it should have been at
[1:03:01] Waterlue. It should have been this or
[1:03:02] this or at Gettysburg it should have
[1:03:04] been that or the battle of Antidum. It
[1:03:06] it makes no sense. you know, the North
[1:03:08] had this and the South had that or
[1:03:09] Napoleon had this and and whoever had
[1:03:11] this and it makes no sense. So, they try
[1:03:13] to go back and study the tactics. They
[1:03:15] study the the military count. They study
[1:03:18] even the weather and and the visual view
[1:03:22] of how it was. Was the sun in their
[1:03:24] face? Was was IT IN THEIR BACK? WHAT WAS
[1:03:26] IT THAT CAUSED THIS? I BELIEVE as a
[1:03:28] people of God, God wants us to know our
[1:03:31] enemy.
[1:03:32] All right. I believe if you and I knew
[1:03:35] how how well Satan knew us tonight, oh,
[1:03:38] it'd probably scare us to death.
[1:03:40] He studies you. He knows EVERYTHING
[1:03:43] ABOUT YOU. YOU CAN JUST whimper a little
[1:03:46] bit and he knows what kind of mood
[1:03:48] you're in.
[1:03:48] That's the truth.
[1:03:49] Well, I'll tell you one thing. I wish
[1:03:50] somebody say amen.
[1:03:53] You realize now that he HE STUDIES YOU
[1:03:55] BECAUSE YOU [screaming] ARE THE ONLY
[1:03:58] real threat that is left in THIS WORLD.
[1:04:03] CAN YOU IMAGINE HOW CLOSE HE IS TO
[1:04:06] GETTING THIS ENTIRE WORLD? HE'S WANTED
[1:04:09] IT FOR THOUSANDS OF YEARS. AND THERE'S A
[1:04:12] HANDFUL OF PEOPLE ON THE EARTH THAT ARE
[1:04:15] KEEPING HIM FROM GETTING HIS KINGDOM.
[1:04:18] IT'S NO [screaming] WONDER HE HATES YOU,
[1:04:21] BUT THE FEELINGS ARE MUTUAL. WE HATE
[1:04:25] HIM. WE HATE HIS KINGDOM. WE HATE WHAT
[1:04:29] HE DOES. AND WE ARE CALLED TO DESTROY
[1:04:32] HIM.
[1:04:37] HALLELUJAH.
[1:04:40] Ephesians 2:1 Paul says it this way. In
[1:04:42] you hath he quickened who were dead in
[1:04:45] trespasses
[1:04:47] and in sins WHERE IN TIMES PAST YOU
[1:04:50] WALKED according to the course OF THIS
[1:04:53] WORLD ACCORDING TO THE prince
[1:04:57] of the power of the air.
[1:05:01] The Greek word there is arone and the
[1:05:04] meaning is this ruler, chief,
[1:05:08] magistrate,
[1:05:09] commander,
[1:05:11] first one in authority. Now this comes
[1:05:14] from the Greek word the root word there
[1:05:16] is aray which means first preeminent
[1:05:20] one.
[1:05:21] SO HERE WAS THE CLOSEST THING TO GOD. If
[1:05:26] God wanted fellowship in heaven, you
[1:05:29] know who his pal was?
[1:05:31] Lucifer.
[1:05:34] So he stopped the approach. Any of the
[1:05:36] other angels come up to the throne of
[1:05:38] God, HE'D WALK RIGHT UP. HEY, HEY, HEY.
[1:05:39] [screaming]
[1:05:41] What do you want?
[1:05:43] I want to talk to father. I I want to
[1:05:46] see Adonai, great Lucifer, lightbringer,
[1:05:49] son of the morning. Isn't it amazing how
[1:05:51] close his titles are? Son of the
[1:05:53] morning, morning star. Amen.
[1:05:58] Right there, God's right-hand man. Why
[1:06:00] the prophet calls him God's right-hand
[1:06:02] man to fellowship. How in the world
[1:06:05] could he go from that to being all this
[1:06:08] OUT HERE?
[1:06:10] ALL THIS WE SEE, ALL THIS THAT WE SEE
[1:06:12] HIM DEAL WITH EVERY DAY, ALL THAT WE
[1:06:14] KNOW IS GOING AROUND THE WORLD, ALL THE
[1:06:16] DEATH, ALL THE CRYING, ALL THE SORROW,
[1:06:18] OH MY, EVERYTHING THAT WE SEE ON the
[1:06:20] evil AND THE DARKNESS, IT ALL COMES FROM
[1:06:22] THE PROJECTION OF ONE BEING OF HIM.
[1:06:25] WANTING TO BE LIKE GOD,
[1:06:27] BUT not holy,
[1:06:28] not pure,
[1:06:30] not righteous,
[1:06:31] but in authority.
[1:06:34] He wanted something that he didn't have.
[1:06:42] Oh, God.
[1:06:44] You see, intelligence
[1:06:47] plays a vital part in any war.
[1:06:52] Intelligence.
[1:06:53] Sure.
[1:06:54] SO WE HAVE OUR SPIES all over the world.
[1:06:58] Amen.
[1:06:58] The world has theirs here.
[1:07:03] Russia's got theirs here.
[1:07:05] Well, I don't mean necessarily here in
[1:07:06] this building tonight, BUT [panting]
[1:07:09] CHINA HAS theirs
[1:07:11] and we have ours there
[1:07:13] where THEY LIVE, RIGHT? WHAT'S IT FOR?
[1:07:16] INTELLIGENCE. SO, WE SAW A GREAT TUMO
[1:07:19] JUST A few weeks ago with these balloons
[1:07:22] that were flying over
[1:07:24] and when you heard about it and read
[1:07:26] about it and all that sort OF THING AND
[1:07:29] THEY'RE STILL TRYING TO DETERMINE
[1:07:30] EXACTLY WHAT WAS IT ALL ABOUT AND CHINA
[1:07:34] OF COURSE SAID NO NO NO NOT so no no no
[1:07:36] no no
[1:07:39] America no no
[1:07:45] TAKE TWO 500,000 THOUSAND MISSILES.
[1:07:49] Shoot them down.
[1:07:50] So, we spend a million dollars just like
[1:07:52] that.
[1:07:54] AND WE'RE STILL TRYING TO DETERMINE WHY.
[1:07:56] BECAUSE INTELLIGENCE
[1:07:59] ABOUT YOUR ENEMY IS POWER
[1:08:02] over your enemy.
[1:08:06] Friends, we don't overcome the devil by
[1:08:08] feeling. I love to feel the Lord. But my
[1:08:10] greatest battles, my greatest victories
[1:08:13] that I have won, most of the time have
[1:08:15] been without the feeling of the presence
[1:08:17] of God at all. But standing right there
[1:08:19] toe-to-toe with the devil in faith. You
[1:08:21] know what I'm talking about. Boy,
[1:08:23] there's times I love to hear from God
[1:08:25] just to know HE AIN'T FORGOT ABOUT MY
[1:08:26] ADDRESS. Even if it was a rebuke, I'd be
[1:08:29] glad to hear it. Just to know he still
[1:08:30] loves me. ANYBODY GO THROUGH THAT? WHY?
[1:08:33] SURE YOU DO. BECAUSE YOU LOVE HIM SO
[1:08:35] MUCH. AND SATAN WILL WANT TO TELL YOU,
[1:08:36] "WELL, you don't feel him. You ain't
[1:08:38] felt this and YOU AIN'T FELT THAT." AND
[1:08:40] WE ALL KNOW WE'VE COME THROUGH A
[1:08:42] TERRIBLE time in the last couple of
[1:08:44] years. Co they say, "Well, it come from
[1:08:46] Wuhan." I disagree. IT COME STRAIGHT
[1:08:48] FROM THE PITS OF HELL IS WHERE THAT
[1:08:49] DEVIL come from. I'm not debating that.
[1:08:52] Maybe it DIDN'T STARTLE THEIR NATURAL,
[1:08:53] BUT IT COME FROM THE FOURTH DIMENSION.
[1:08:56] BECAUSE THESE ANGELS THAT WE'RE TALKING
[1:08:58] ABOUT TONIGHT, SOME OF THEM WERE SENT
[1:09:00] into the FIELD OF EPILEPSY. SOME OF THEM
[1:09:02] WERE SENT INTO THE FIELD OF POLITICS.
[1:09:05] SOME OF THEM WERE SENT INTO THE field of
[1:09:06] religion. And they were sending to
[1:09:09] diversify IN ORDER TO BRING ABOUT ONE
[1:09:11] THING. THIS COMMAND RIGHT HERE. I
[1:09:14] [screaming] WANT TO BE GOD.
[1:09:17] That's right.
[1:09:20] Not God is love.
[1:09:22] Not God is mercy.
[1:09:24] But I want power.
[1:09:27] I want control.
[1:09:32] And he will lie. He will steal. He will
[1:09:35] cheat. He will do whatever he's got to
[1:09:38] do
[1:09:39] to get it.
[1:09:41] Then I come back to this of what I read
[1:09:44] you what brother Brandham said which is
[1:09:46] an astounding statement to me that Satan
[1:09:49] has had a marvelous
[1:09:53] success.
[1:09:54] What a thing for a prophet of God TO SAY
[1:09:58] ABOUT our enemy.
[1:10:01] WHAT A THING TO SAY. YOU MEAN THE DEVIL
[1:10:03] HAS BEEN ABLE TO DO what he wanted to
[1:10:05] do? Yeah. [screaming]
[1:10:08] But keep in mind,
[1:10:10] he was allowed to do
[1:10:13] what he wanted to death.
[1:10:15] NOW, FATHER HAD HIS PERSONAL DIARY with
[1:10:19] the name of his elected.
[1:10:22] You imagine the angels as they would
[1:10:23] hover around him and Lucifer would come
[1:10:26] close and try to peek over and see them
[1:10:29] notes. and he'd notice every time he'd
[1:10:31] come real close to that one book, Papa
[1:10:33] would just kind of shut it up.
[1:10:37] Now, you know, the prophet of God tells
[1:10:38] us how that ACTUALLY COME ABOUT. WE KNOW
[1:10:41] THAT WE had to wait till our children
[1:10:43] were born
[1:10:45] to be able to take pictures of them,
[1:10:47] right? AND THEN WE MAKE our little
[1:10:49] family album. Of course, used to we use
[1:10:51] photos. Now everything is digital. SO,
[1:10:53] WE MAKE OUR FAMILY ALBUM AND THERE
[1:10:55] little Donald Lee Reagan Jr. born July
[1:10:58] the 9th, 1956 to Dawn and Betty Reagan.
[1:11:02] And he he weighed so much and so long
[1:11:05] and this and that and the other and they
[1:11:07] had a little picture of me and put it
[1:11:08] there. BUT THE PROPHET TELLS US IN
[1:11:10] QUESTION AND ANSWERS THAT GOD TOOK A
[1:11:13] PICTURE of you when YOU WAS AT YOUR
[1:11:16] BEST,
[1:11:17] NOT WHEN YOU was 18 or 20, BUT BEFORE
[1:11:20] the foundation OF THE WORLD.
[1:11:23] SO YOU IMAGINE PAPA SITTING THERE WITH
[1:11:25] HIS FAMILY ALBUM say [laughter]
[1:11:30] oh
[1:11:31] that's my boy
[1:11:33] Moses a
[1:11:36] young therea
[1:11:39] she's my young one too but boy she's got
[1:11:41] a temper man.
[1:11:46] Oh there's THERE'S LITTLE JOSHUA THERE'S
[1:11:49] HABACOOK. THERE'S ZEPHANIAH. THERE'S
[1:11:51] ZACHARIAH. THERE'S MALACHI. OH, AND AND
[1:11:54] AND LUCIFER WOULD NEVER BE ABLE TO TAKE
[1:11:56] A PEEK INSIDE OF THAT. OH, IT WAS A
[1:11:59] PERSONAL POSSESSION. BUT YOU SEE,
[1:12:00] FATHER, HE HAD THIS WITHIN HIMSELF.
[1:12:02] REMEMBER, HE CANNOT create sin. He
[1:12:04] cannot create evil. No, there's no way
[1:12:06] he can't. But if HE WOULD MAKE A BEING
[1:12:10] THAT WOULD BE ABLE TO WORK under the law
[1:12:12] of contrast, UNDER THE LAW OF CONTRAST,
[1:12:14] you have light and you have darkness.
[1:12:17] UNDER THE LAW OF CONTRAST, you have
[1:12:18] healing and you have sickness. UNDER THE
[1:12:20] LAW OF CONTRAST, YOU HAVE GOOD TIMES AND
[1:12:22] YOU HAVE BAD TIMES. How many lives under
[1:12:24] the law of contrast still in Buford?
[1:12:26] Yeah. Won't you be glad one day the law
[1:12:28] of contrast will be gone? Praise be to
[1:12:31] God. NO MORE NIGHT, NO MORE SICKNESS, NO
[1:12:33] MORE TROUBLE.
[1:12:35] BUT GOD CANNOT MAKE HIM DO IT. HE CANNOT
[1:12:38] MAKE MAN FALL. HE CANNOT MAKE THIS
[1:12:41] HAPPEN. BUT WHAT IF GOD CREATES HIMSELF
[1:12:45] an enemy?
[1:12:47] Amen.
[1:12:48] Amen. and he'll make him WITH GODLIKE
[1:12:52] characteristics and traits. Now, don't
[1:12:55] look at me funny. I just read that quote
[1:12:57] before I come out here.
[1:13:01] So, if God made an enemy, and we'll say
[1:13:04] like this, GOD WAS A GREAT BIG powerful
[1:13:08] God.
[1:13:09] And then God made an enemy about like
[1:13:12] this
[1:13:16] little bitty old T90 enemy. And he just
[1:13:19] kind of come up and punch AT GOD. HEY
[1:13:21] GOD. HEY [screaming] GOD. GOD, I want to
[1:13:24] be like you. Say, "Yeah, right.
[1:13:27] You and what army? You want to be like
[1:13:30] me?" But what if God makes one
[1:13:34] whose ambition
[1:13:37] is like God?
[1:13:41] WOW.
[1:13:43] WHAT IF GOD MAKES ONE that will mimic
[1:13:46] what he sees God doing?
[1:13:49] So God makes a church, he makes a
[1:13:51] church. God has prophets, he has
[1:13:53] prophets. God has pastors, he has
[1:13:55] pastors. God has a church, he has a
[1:13:57] church. What God does, he has to wait.
[1:13:59] Now remember, he's not the originator.
[1:14:01] OH, [laughter] GLORY. HE'S NOT THE
[1:14:03] ORIGINATOR, BUT HE'LL WATCH GOD. AND
[1:14:05] THEN HE JUST MAKES ONE HIMSELF. And then
[1:14:07] HE SENDS IT RIGHT AMONG the religious
[1:14:09] aspect of people that are looking for
[1:14:11] God in that avenue. AND THEY SWALLOW IT
[1:14:13] DOWN HOOK, LINE, AND SINKER. AND YET GOD
[1:14:15] IN EVERY age has HAD THE ELECT OF GOD
[1:14:18] THERE. AND THEY LOOK RIGHT THROUGH and
[1:14:19] they say, "I may not understand it. I
[1:14:21] may not be able to explain it, but
[1:14:23] there's something about that that just
[1:14:24] ain't right."
[1:14:27] Come on.
[1:14:29] So this being,
[1:14:31] it hits him one day, brother Jason,
[1:14:34] he looks around, he says,
[1:14:37] I just realized this.
[1:14:40] I am the greatest angel
[1:14:44] in heaven.
[1:14:48] There aren't two that stop the approach.
[1:14:52] This is the birth of sin.
[1:14:58] Oh, this is so devastating.
[1:15:00] Not only to the devil, but to us.
[1:15:04] We begin to think about oursel, I'm
[1:15:07] this, I'm that, I'm this, that, and the
[1:15:10] other. No. No wonder the prophet tells
[1:15:13] us the way up,
[1:15:16] is down,
[1:15:18] RIGHT?
[1:15:19] YOU SEE, SATAN CAN'T DO THAT. DON'T YOU
[1:15:22] SEE WHAT THE COMING OF THE LORD JESUS to
[1:15:23] the EARTH DID? IT PROJECTED SOMETHING
[1:15:27] THAT THE GOD OF THIS WORLD CANNOT DO.
[1:15:31] HE CANNOT HUMBLE HIMSELF. YOU YOU SAW,
[1:15:33] OH, THE LORD JESUS HUMBLED HIMSELF SO
[1:15:35] MUCH TO BECOME A MAN. YOU'VE ONLY GOT
[1:15:37] PART OF THE STORY.
[1:15:40] He humbled himself to become a sinner.
[1:15:44] NOW, DON'T GET QUIET ON ME. DEMONOLOGY
[1:15:46] PART TWO, PARAGRAPH 199.
[1:15:50] I THINK OF HOW WHEN GOD SENT HIM TO HELL
[1:15:55] because of his sins.
[1:15:58] Now, he never sinned. HE NEVER DONE
[1:16:00] NOTHING WRONG. BUT HE TOOK your sins
[1:16:02] upon himself.
[1:16:05] THE DEVIL CANNOT DO ANY SUCH THING. HE
[1:16:08] CANNOT HUMBLE HIMSELF.
[1:16:11] To me, this is one of the greatest
[1:16:12] proofs Jesus Christ was God. He was not
[1:16:15] a man. He was not an evil spirit.
[1:16:17] BECAUSE EVIL CANNOT HUMBLE ITSELF TO
[1:16:20] SUCH A PLACE.
[1:16:27] [sighs and gasps]
[1:16:29] And how was it that this being was able
[1:16:31] to do it? I'm I'm not I know that you
[1:16:34] already know it, but let me just quote
[1:16:35] it to you that the prophet said he went
[1:16:37] over into the north side of heaven and
[1:16:40] he began to exalt himself above the
[1:16:42] stars of God. Now you imagine
[1:16:45] that it wasn't a bunch of angels that
[1:16:46] come in there and they had cigarette
[1:16:47] smoke on their breasts and they had, you
[1:16:49] know, the cigarette marks them on their
[1:16:50] fingers and they spit out their tobacos.
[1:16:52] They come in and they just cleared the
[1:16:53] porn off of their phone and I mean they
[1:16:55] come in there just been in a bar the
[1:16:57] night before.
[1:16:58] All they had ever known was Hallelujah.
[1:17:03] Hallelu.
[1:17:06] maybe for eons of time,
[1:17:09] thousands, tens of thousands of years,
[1:17:11] they worshiped, they loved, they adored.
[1:17:16] That's all they done. That's all they
[1:17:17] done. Just worshiped.
[1:17:21] And all it took was a little bit of
[1:17:23] discontentment.
[1:17:25] Amen.
[1:17:26] Amen.
[1:17:26] And then Satan let him know, hey, we're
[1:17:28] having a meeting. Any y'all want to
[1:17:30] come?
[1:17:32] And the prophet said that Satan began to
[1:17:36] preach to him.
[1:17:38] The first preacher wasn't Moses.
[1:17:41] It wasn't even Jesus. It was the devil.
[1:17:46] So wonder what he preached. The goodness
[1:17:49] of God,
[1:17:53] the mercy of God, how great GOD IS.
[1:17:56] THERE MUST have been some rebellion.
[1:17:59] THERE MUST HAVE BEEN SOME DISCONTENTMENT
[1:18:01] TO EGG ON. YOU IMAGINE NOW THESE ANGELS
[1:18:04] as they are standing sitting whatever
[1:18:06] their posture was and they hear this
[1:18:08] sermon
[1:18:10] and it actually Yeah.
[1:18:13] Yeah.
[1:18:15] I've been feeling the same way.
[1:18:18] I MEAN EVERYTHING I DO IS FOR HIM.
[1:18:23] IT'S ALL [screaming] ABOUT HIM. EVERY
[1:18:25] DAY IT'S HIM. WHEN I GET UP IT'S HIM.
[1:18:28] WHEN I GO TO BED, IT'S HIM.
[1:18:36] And one by one,
[1:18:40] and notice where Satan started at,
[1:18:42] the prophet tells us in that day on
[1:18:44] Calvary in 1960 that his soul sinned.
[1:18:49] Not his spirit, NOT HIS BODY. HIS SOUL
[1:18:53] SIN FROM WITHIN WITH WHAT? I'LL TELL YOU
[1:18:55] ONE THING. I'M GOING TO GO OUT. I'M
[1:18:57] GOING TO GET SO DRUNK, BOY. I'M GOING TO
[1:18:59] HAVE ME [screaming] A TIME.
[1:19:01] It did not begin with him wanting to get
[1:19:03] drunk. Now, you understand the devil has
[1:19:05] never been drunk in his life.
[1:19:07] The devil will talk you into drinking,
[1:19:08] but he knows better.
[1:19:12] THE DEVIL WILL TALK YOU INTO SMOKING AND
[1:19:14] CHEWING TOBACCO AND DOING ALL THAT SORT
[1:19:15] OF THING. THE DEVIL AIN'T NEVER HAD NO
[1:19:17] amber running out of HIS MOUTH. HE WON'T
[1:19:19] NEVER SMOKE no pale or no Winston. He
[1:19:21] knows better. He's got better sense THAN
[1:19:22] THAT. HE AIN'T GOING [screaming] TO DO
[1:19:24] SUCH. BUT WHERE DID SIN START? IN HIS
[1:19:27] SOUL.
[1:19:28] HIS SOUL GIVES BIRTH TO SIN WITH WHAT?
[1:19:32] [screaming] I
[1:19:37] The most deadly disease man has ever
[1:19:40] known.
[1:19:42] It's not leukemia, not Baris disease,
[1:19:46] not lymphoma.
[1:19:48] It's the eye disease.
[1:19:52] I want this. I want that. I believe
[1:19:54] this. I believe that.
[1:19:56] Yeah.
[1:19:59] Isn't it amazing then when the Lord
[1:20:00] Jesus comes and he says, "Father,
[1:20:03] not my will
[1:20:07] but thine be done." WHAT'S HE DOING?
[1:20:09] REVERSING THE SIN FROM THE SOUL of the
[1:20:13] devil. Don't you understand? Whenever we
[1:20:14] are born, brothers and sister, if it
[1:20:16] wasn't for the grace of God, there
[1:20:17] wouldn't be no hope for us. WE ARE BORN
[1:20:19] LOST. WE WERE BORN IN SUCH A WRETCHED
[1:20:21] mess that we're born Did Which of your
[1:20:24] parents begin to teach you children how
[1:20:26] TO LIE?
[1:20:28] ANY Y'ALL EVER go to lying school?
[1:20:31] Any y'all EVER GO TO DECEIT SCHOOL AND
[1:20:33] YET YOU AND YOUR SISTER was playing with
[1:20:35] something your mama said, "Don't do
[1:20:36] that. Don't do that." And one OF YOU
[1:20:38] BROKE IT AND both of you said, "She did
[1:20:39] it. He done it." No, mama. I promise it
[1:20:41] wasn't me. I swear to God it wasn't me.
[1:20:44] WHERE DO WE GET THAT AT?
[1:20:46] WE GOT [screaming] THAT FROM THE
[1:20:47] ORIGINATOR OF SIN BECAUSE EVE ALLOWED
[1:20:51] HIM EVE ALLOWED [screaming] HIM TO enter
[1:20:56] the human race.
[1:20:58] That's right.
[1:21:03] So God had to have a way to enter the
[1:21:06] human race in order to reverse this.
[1:21:10] A woman let the devil in and a woman let
[1:21:13] God in. Amen.
[1:21:17] [sighs and gasps]
[1:21:19] Now, SINCE THE DEVIL IS A CREATED BEING,
[1:21:23] let me just strip him down a little bit
[1:21:25] for you tonight by the help of the Lord.
[1:21:27] He is not omnipotent.
[1:21:32] He is not omnipotent.
[1:21:35] He is not omnipresent.
[1:21:38] He ain't even the way people make Santa
[1:21:40] Claus. He sees you when you're sleeping
[1:21:43] and he knows when you're awake. No, he
[1:21:45] don't. That's a lie. But you know what?
[1:21:47] IF WE'RE NOT CAREFUL, THAT'S EXACTLY THE
[1:21:49] ATTRIBUTES we'll give to the devil. Oh,
[1:21:51] the devil's this and the devil's that.
[1:21:52] He ain't near as big AS WHAT MANY TIMES
[1:21:55] WE PUT HIM OUT TO BE. I'LL TELL YOU WHAT
[1:21:58] HE IS. HE'S A BLUFF.
[1:22:00] HE'S A BLUFF [screaming]
[1:22:02] AND HE'S A LIAR. AND HE BLUFFS A LOT OF
[1:22:06] GOD'S CHILDREN.
[1:22:08] WOO!
[1:22:10] Oh my goodness. SATAN IS NOT ALL
[1:22:14] KNOWING.
[1:22:16] HE IS NOT [screaming] ALL POWERFUL.
[1:22:20] WELL, GLORY TO GOD. HE CANNOT BE
[1:22:23] EVERYWHERE AT THE SAME TIME.
[1:22:31] You say, "HOW DOES HE DO ALL THIS?" His
[1:22:34] helpers
[1:22:36] Wow.
[1:22:36] Amen.
[1:22:38] You remember when Daniel
[1:22:40] had begun to seek the words
[1:22:43] of Jeremiah's prophecy
[1:22:46] and Daniel began to pray. The Bible
[1:22:49] tells us that he prayed for 21 days
[1:22:53] and finally an angel of God appears
[1:22:55] before Daniel AND HE SAID, "OH DANIEL,
[1:22:58] beloved of the Lord,"
[1:23:00] he don't give him his answer first. He
[1:23:02] gives him the consolation and the reason
[1:23:03] for his delay.
[1:23:06] NOW HE SAYS YOUR PRAYER WAS HEARD IN
[1:23:08] heaven the very first day that you
[1:23:09] prayed.
[1:23:10] Imagine Daniel saying, "Well, why in the
[1:23:12] world you take so long to get here?"
[1:23:14] But this angel IS FIXING TO SHOW him a
[1:23:18] spiritual warfare.
[1:23:21] SO THIS ANGEL THAT GOD SENT down to give
[1:23:25] Daniel this answer was an angel of
[1:23:28] lesser degree
[1:23:31] than the angel over the city he lived
[1:23:33] in. Yeah. Amen.
[1:23:34] Even though that angel had fallen and
[1:23:37] become a demon.
[1:23:40] SO HE WRESTLES AND HE WRESTLES AND HE
[1:23:43] WRESTLED. NOW YOU THINK THEY LOST THEIR
[1:23:44] POWER? NO. DID ELVIS PRESLEY LOSE HIS
[1:23:47] ABILITY to swing his hips and be able to
[1:23:50] sing like a mockenberg when he got out
[1:23:52] of church? No. HE SIMPLY TOOK WHAT GOD
[1:23:55] GAVE HIM AND USED IT FOR THE DEVIL.
[1:23:58] NOW WHEN THESE ANGELS FELL FROM THEIR
[1:24:00] HIERARCHY, THEY DID NOT LOSE THEIR
[1:24:02] [screaming] POWER, THEY CAN APPEAR, THEY
[1:24:05] CAN DISAPPEAR. EVEN SATAN HIMSELF can
[1:24:08] appear as an angel of light. HE CAN
[1:24:11] MIMIC HIMSELF TO look like an angel of
[1:24:14] God CUZ GOD NEVER STRIPPED him of all of
[1:24:17] that authority. Oh my goodness.
[1:24:21] SO HERE COMES THE ANGEL OF GOD TO BRING
[1:24:23] DOWN DANIEL'S ANSWER AND USE THIS DEMON
[1:24:26] OVER THIS KING. HE SAID, "HEY,
[1:24:29] WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
[1:24:31] THIS IS MY DOMAIN." WELL, GOD SENT ME
[1:24:33] DOWN WITH A MESSAGE. I'LL TELL YOU ONE
[1:24:35] THING. SO, THEY GO AT IT. However it is
[1:24:37] that angels fight.
[1:24:41] So, THEY LABOR AND THEY FIGHT AND THEY
[1:24:43] STRUGGLE.
[1:24:46] But this angel finally got some help.
[1:24:49] Yes, sir.
[1:24:50] From the chief angel,
[1:24:52] Michael,
[1:24:53] which is the angel of THE JEWS. SO, HERE
[1:24:56] IS AN ANGEL THAT HAS FALLEN THAT STILL
[1:25:00] HAS A HIGHER RANK, LORD, CHILDREN, and
[1:25:04] people that don't believe they need a
[1:25:05] pastor.
[1:25:07] I WANT YOU TO NOTICE THIS ANGEL OF GOD
[1:25:09] THAT HAD NOT FALLEN. At least he had
[1:25:11] enough sense to know he needed help.
[1:25:15] WELL, PRAISE THE LORD. HE HAD ENOUGH
[1:25:18] SENSE TO KNOW HE WAS OUTGUNNED AND
[1:25:19] OUTMAN. SO, HE SAID, "LORD GOD, I NEED
[1:25:22] SOME HELP. DANIEL, WOULD YOU SEND ME
[1:25:23] SOMEBODY?" SO, WHO DO YOU SEND? MICHAEL
[1:25:26] CHRIST.
[1:25:27] HALLELUJAH.
[1:25:28] OH MY. I WANT YOU TO NOTICE WHAT MICHAEL
[1:25:31] DOES. HE BEGINS TO TAKE ON THIS DEMON
[1:25:34] AND WORSHIP or war WITH HIM AND PUTS HIM
[1:25:37] IN HIS PLACE. AND THIS ORIGINAL ANGEL
[1:25:39] COMES DOWN THERE [screaming] WHERE
[1:25:40] DANIEL IS AND gives him this message.
[1:25:43] Now whenever he gets READY TO GO, HE
[1:25:45] SAID, "DANIEL, LO, I MUST GO. I MUST
[1:25:49] FIGHT WITH THE PRINCE of Persia."
[1:25:54] Amen.
[1:25:57] But the kingdom of Persia had not yet
[1:25:59] been born.
[1:26:01] It was not yet ruling in a world power.
[1:26:05] [snorts]
[1:26:06] The demon that was over Babylon was not
[1:26:09] going to be the same demon over Persia.
[1:26:12] Don't you understand? The demon that
[1:26:13] took charge of the denominational
[1:26:14] systems. That's why they diversify.
[1:26:16] Don't you understand all the cults and
[1:26:18] the clicks and the clans that's raised
[1:26:19] up in our message and all the men that's
[1:26:22] pull off this way and that way and
[1:26:24] another. What is it's just another demon
[1:26:25] out of hell, but they have a different
[1:26:27] trait. They have a different doctrine or
[1:26:29] different characteristic. And they'll
[1:26:31] come and fight OVER THIS AND FIGHT OVER
[1:26:32] THAT. WELL, COME ON, CHILDREN. BUT WHAT
[1:26:34] IS IT? IT'S ALL FROM THE CHIEF DOWN
[1:26:37] THERE IN [screaming] HADES WHO HAS THIS
[1:26:39] DESIRE. I WANT TO BE LIKE GOD.
[1:26:43] DO YOU KNOW ONE OF THE GREATEST conquest
[1:26:46] that a man would take when he would go
[1:26:48] in to take a city?
[1:26:53] They would tell their fighters, their
[1:26:55] warriors, their commanders,
[1:26:57] save the queen.
[1:27:03] And this conqueror
[1:27:05] would come to the queen
[1:27:08] and force her
[1:27:10] cuz to them that was the ultimate
[1:27:14] conquest.
[1:27:15] Not the walls, not just the gold,
[1:27:20] but force the king's wife
[1:27:23] to bear his seed.
[1:27:27] You think Satan wants Buford? Lord have
[1:27:30] mercy. I've been driving down there in
[1:27:32] the last day or two and seeing all this
[1:27:33] grass and all this mud. And I told Carol
[1:27:36] yesterday, I think I'm down back down
[1:27:38] the land of Egypt again.
[1:27:44] [laughter]
[1:27:45] I know. I know some of y'all love it.
[1:27:46] Well, for my part, you can have everlast
[1:27:49] segrass.
[1:27:51] Give me the mountains any day.
[1:27:53] [laughter]
[1:27:54] But I want to tell you one thing. That
[1:27:55] holy city ain't coming down on no flat
[1:27:57] down here in Buford. It's coming down on
[1:27:59] a mountain. So, I do have a scripture
[1:28:00] against you.
[1:28:05] DO YOU THINK SATAN WANTS NEW YORK? YOU
[1:28:08] THINK SATAN WANTS CHICAGO? YOU THINK
[1:28:10] THAT'S WHAT HE'S AFTER? [screaming]
[1:28:12] HIS greatest conquest IS THE WIFE
[1:28:17] OF THE KING HIMSELF.
[1:28:24] And don't you know God's prophet knew
[1:28:25] that his message would become successful
[1:28:28] to every type that had been down through
[1:28:31] the ages. This is why he warned us over
[1:28:33] and over again. There'll be men that'll
[1:28:36] come in and do this. There'll be men
[1:28:37] that'll come and do that. He knew his
[1:28:39] message would follow in THE SAME
[1:28:41] PATTERN. BUT HE also knew there would be
[1:28:43] a bribe. But let me tell you what he
[1:28:44] said about it. HE SAID, "IF I did not
[1:28:46] believe in predestination in an
[1:28:48] election," he said, "I would be a mighty
[1:28:50] discouraged man this morning." CAN YOU
[1:28:52] IMAGINE GOD? LET ME JUST SAY THIS. I
[1:28:54] KNOW YOU KNOW IT. I'd like to preach IT
[1:28:56] SOMETIME. BUT GOD HAS MANY, MANY LAWS.
[1:28:58] BUT one law that I absolutely love about
[1:29:00] God is a law of sovereignty. And that's
[1:29:02] A LAW THAT GOD HIMSELF will step in when
[1:29:05] man is ABOUT TO MESS UP THE WHOLE THING.
[1:29:07] AND GOD'S USED IT ON ME. GOD USED IT ON
[1:29:10] BROTHER BRANDHAM. GOD'S PROBABLY USED IT
[1:29:11] ON MANY of you WHEN YOU WAS FIXING TO
[1:29:14] MESS UP THE WHOLE PROGRAM OF GOD. AND
[1:29:16] GOD RESERVES THAT RIGHT WHEN DEALING
[1:29:18] WITH HIS SEED TO STEP IN AND SAY, "ALL
[1:29:21] RIGHT, DEVIL, BACK OFF. THIS IS MY
[1:29:24] DAUGHTER. THIS IS MY SON. YOU ARE NOT
[1:29:27] DOING THIS TO THEM." THANK GOD FOR THE
[1:29:29] LAW OF SOVEREIGNTY. [applause]
[1:29:32] BROTHER BRANDON WOULD HAVE KILLED
[1:29:33] HIMSELF. BROTHER BRANDON WOULD KILLED
[1:29:35] ANOTHER MAN. [screaming] BUT WHAT
[1:29:36] OVERRODE IT? IT WAS GOD'S LAW OF
[1:29:39] SOVEREIGNTY.
[1:29:41] [applause]
[1:29:44] [sighs]
[1:29:48] DANIEL, you're a man greatly loved of
[1:29:51] the Lord.
[1:29:53] Imagine Daniel saying his mind, I am.
[1:29:58] How come you didn't come?
[1:30:01] So he explained it to him. Now he said,
[1:30:03] "I'm fixing to leave and I'm fixing to
[1:30:06] go fight with the prince of Persia."
[1:30:10] Different channel. A demon had already
[1:30:12] been chosen for the new domain.
[1:30:15] Victory Day 1963. THE PROPHET TELLS
[1:30:17] TELLS US WHAT CAUSES wars is because the
[1:30:21] spirits that control THESE NATIONS. YOU
[1:30:23] UNDERSTAND WHAT happened last year, a
[1:30:25] little over a year ago, whenever Russia
[1:30:27] wanted to attack Ukraine. You understand
[1:30:28] what happened? The demon over Russia got
[1:30:32] jealous against the demon in Ukraine.
[1:30:35] NOW, THINK OF IT. SATAN'S KINGDOM IS
[1:30:38] ESTABLISHED UPON ARGUING AND FUSSING AND
[1:30:42] PERVERSION.
[1:30:44] LORD, can you imagine what it's like
[1:30:45] DOWN IN HELL?
[1:30:48] CAN YOU IMAGINE [screaming] THEM DEVILS?
[1:30:50] AND THE PROPHET SAID, "WHEN what brings
[1:30:51] WAR IS THEM DEVILS get jealous of one
[1:30:55] another." I'll tell you one thing
[1:30:56] friends, we don't need that kind of
[1:30:58] jealousy in our church.
[1:31:00] We need love. We need forgiveness. We
[1:31:02] need understanding of one another. IS
[1:31:03] THAT RIGHT?
[1:31:05] GOD ALWAYS HAS DIVERSITY AND HE WILL IN
[1:31:08] THE NEW KINGDOM. THERE WON'T BE THAT in
[1:31:10] the new city. Always has been, always
[1:31:12] will be.
[1:31:13] BUT WE REALIZE NOBODY CAN TAKE OUR
[1:31:15] PLACE. MY GOODNESS, I CAN'T PREACH LIKE
[1:31:17] some of these brothers. I can't do this
[1:31:19] and that and the other like some of the
[1:31:20] rest of them, but they CAN'T DO IT LIKE
[1:31:21] I can either. WE SAY, "WELL, I AIN'T
[1:31:23] NOTHING. I AIN'T NOBODY. YOU MUST NOT BE
[1:31:26] MORE IMPORTANT THAN THAT CUZ GOD DIED
[1:31:28] FOR YOU. HE COME IN THE FORM OF A HUMAN
[1:31:30] BEING IN ORDER TO PAY THE PRICE. HE
[1:31:32] SAVED YOU. HE GAVE YOU THE HOLY GHOST.
[1:31:34] AND THERE AIN'T NOBODY ON THIS EARTH CAN
[1:31:36] take your place.
[1:31:40] [panting]
[1:31:41] What's this? Paul in Ephesians 6:12.
[1:31:45] Paul calls them principalities,
[1:31:49] powers,
[1:31:51] rulers,
[1:31:53] spiritual wickedness
[1:31:55] in high places.
[1:31:58] If you look at these words and you look
[1:31:59] at each one of them and see the meaning,
[1:32:01] what you see is degrees of these demons.
[1:32:06] Now you imagine a little old regular
[1:32:07] headache devil. He must not have much
[1:32:10] authority.
[1:32:13] Amen.
[1:32:13] He just kind of aggravates folks with
[1:32:15] headaches, you know, just goes around,
[1:32:16] just go here or go there.
[1:32:20] [snorts]
[1:32:20] But what about a cancer devil?
[1:32:22] What about an epileptic devil, which the
[1:32:24] prophet said was one of the only ones
[1:32:26] that ever got away from him?
[1:32:29] Ever got away from him,
[1:32:31] an epilepsy devil?
[1:32:33] Now you SEE, SATAN PICKED THEM AND
[1:32:35] PLACED them according to the delegated
[1:32:38] authority, not given by him, but given
[1:32:41] by God.
[1:32:45] Oh my goodness.
[1:32:48] It ain't no wonder they absolutely hated
[1:32:50] God's prophet in this age.
[1:32:54] We for the first time got a window open
[1:32:58] into the supernatural. Yeah.
[1:33:02] So here a man is standing and them
[1:33:04] demons, these people come up with their
[1:33:06] sickness, their diseases. They go to
[1:33:07] getting all nervous. Church age book. He
[1:33:09] said you ought to watch the expression
[1:33:10] on their face
[1:33:11] when that devil knows he's fixing to be
[1:33:13] exposed.
[1:33:14] I hope you understand this. The devil is
[1:33:17] actually afraid.
[1:33:21] Do you understand? THE DEVIL IS SCARED
[1:33:23] TO DEATH in this service right here
[1:33:24] tonight
[1:33:25] BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHY? HE KNOWS SOME OF
[1:33:27] YOU ARE GOING to see his tricks. AND
[1:33:30] YOU'RE GOING TO FIND OUT A LITTLE BIT
[1:33:31] MORE ABOUT HIS TACTICS AND YOU'RE GOING
[1:33:33] TO GO OUT OF HERE AND YOU'RE GOING TO
[1:33:35] SAY, "DEVIL, I'M SICK AND TIRED OF THIS
[1:33:37] STUFF. OUT OF [screaming] MY HOUSE, OUT
[1:33:39] OF MY BODY, OUT OF MY FAMILY, AWAY FROM
[1:33:42] ME, SATAN, I AM [screaming] ORDAINED TO
[1:33:45] BE MORE THAN A CONQUEROR." WE'RE NOT
[1:33:48] CALLED TO BE SURVIVORS. WE'RE CALLED TO
[1:33:51] BE CONQUERORS. WE'RE CALLED TO BE
[1:33:53] VICTORIOUS IN THIS AGE OF HELL.
[1:34:00] [panting]
[1:34:01] So a person walks up the prophet
[1:34:03] standing there breaks into the realm of
[1:34:05] vision. Isn't it amazing? Fourth
[1:34:07] dimension is the realm of vision. Now
[1:34:10] remember there were seven dimensions
[1:34:11] created in the beginning. God knew that
[1:34:12] he would need them. Ta time would need
[1:34:14] them. Man would need them. That is
[1:34:16] light, matter, time, science where the
[1:34:18] unbeliever goes, where the believer goes
[1:34:19] and where God is. Seven dimensions by
[1:34:21] which the supernatural worlds would be
[1:34:23] able to merge together and affect this
[1:34:25] tangible world. So in the fourth
[1:34:27] dimension is where we got the television
[1:34:29] waves, the ether waves. In the fourth
[1:34:31] dimension is the same realm that a
[1:34:32] prophet sees his vision. So he's
[1:34:34] standing out there just like this, his
[1:34:35] eyes wide open and maybe a person 80
[1:34:38] years old walks up and all of a sudden
[1:34:40] he's trying time traveling. So he goes,
[1:34:45] I see you in a yellow checkress
[1:34:49] coming home from school one day and a
[1:34:52] dog got after you. Yeah,
[1:34:55] you run. You went up on the porch.
[1:34:58] You fell through the screen door. It's
[1:35:01] made you afraid your whole life.
[1:35:04] Then fast forward,
[1:35:08] but go your way. You are healed.
[1:35:12] So in the fourth dimension, it's like
[1:35:14] time travel where he would see them
[1:35:15] there presently, then he would look back
[1:35:17] and see what happened to them maybe 15
[1:35:19] years ago, 15 YEARS AGO. THEN GOD WOULD
[1:35:21] ALLOW him to move up in their future and
[1:35:23] see them as an old man or an old woman.
[1:35:25] So he was moving from one dimension to
[1:35:27] another. AND YOU IMAGINE THEM DEVILS AND
[1:35:30] THEY SAID, "GOOD LORD,
[1:35:33] what in THE WORLD HAVE WE GOT HERE?" IT
[1:35:35] AIN'T NO WONDER THE DEVIL ATTACKED HIM.
[1:35:36] LET ME GO AHEAD AND SAY IT. IT AIN'T NO
[1:35:38] WONDER THE DEVIL'S STILL ATTACKING HIM.
[1:35:41] WELL, COME ON, CHILDREN. WHY? THERE'S
[1:35:43] NOT ANOTHER MESSAGE ON THE EARTH THAT
[1:35:45] SATAN HATES THE WAY HE HATES THIS
[1:35:47] MESSAGE. HE STILL HATES IT. HE'S STILL
[1:35:50] TRYING TO BRING IT DOWN. BUT LET ME GO
[1:35:52] AHEAD AND TELL HIM TONIGHT, HE WILL
[1:35:54] NEVER DESTROY US. HE WILL NEVER DESTROY
[1:35:58] THIS BRIDE. HE WILL NEVER DESTROY THE
[1:36:01] EFFECTS OF THIS END TIME MESSAGE. WHY,
[1:36:03] BROTHER DONNIE? BECAUSE WE [screaming]
[1:36:05] WILL NOT ALLOW HIM TO.
[1:36:12] HE CANNOT DO IT UNLESS we
[1:36:16] as the message followers
[1:36:19] let him.
[1:36:25] Well, as for one, I ain't going to.
[1:36:31] The 27th day of this month,
[1:36:34] 40 years ago,
[1:36:37] I stood in a little church in Kentucky
[1:36:39] that I started
[1:36:41] March the 27th, 1983,
[1:36:44] and I preached about God sending a
[1:36:48] prophet.
[1:36:49] I'm more determined now than I was then.
[1:36:52] You say you're a lot older and uglier.
[1:36:54] Well, not over look in the mirror
[1:36:55] yourself, honey.
[1:36:58] That's right. I am older and I may be a
[1:37:00] little bit uglier along with it, but
[1:37:01] I've got more determination now than I
[1:37:03] had 40 years ago. Anybody in here with
[1:37:06] me? YOU GOT MORE DETERMINATION NOW. WHY?
[1:37:09] [screaming] CUZ YOU BURNED ALL THE
[1:37:10] BRIDGES BEHIND YOU. YOU AIN'T GOT
[1:37:12] NOWHERE ELSE YOU'RE GOING TO. WE'RE NOT
[1:37:14] LOOKING TO GO ANYWHERE ELSE. WE'RE
[1:37:16] LOOKING TO BE CAUGHT AWAY, BUT WE WANT
[1:37:18] TO MAKE HELL PAY WHILE WE'RE HERE.
[1:37:22] THIS IS WAR.
[1:37:26] THIS IS WAR. IF THE DEVIL HAS ATTACKED
[1:37:29] YOUR CHILDREN AND GOT THEM COLD AND
[1:37:31] INDIFFERENT AND BACKSLID, YOU NEED TO
[1:37:33] STAND YOUR GROUND AND SAY, "DEVIL, THIS
[1:37:36] IS WAR." IF HE'S ATTACKED YOUR BODY,
[1:37:39] [screaming]
[1:37:40] YOU NEED TO TELL HIM, "THIS IS WAR.
[1:37:48] [applause]
[1:37:50] [sighs]
[1:37:54] [gasps]
[1:37:54] OH, you say, "Brother Donnie, be
[1:37:56] careful. Be careful. He'll jump on you.
[1:38:01] If he does, he's going to get the ride
[1:38:03] of his life."
[1:38:06] Because greater is he that is in me than
[1:38:09] he that is in the world. Greater is he
[1:38:12] that's in you, he that's in you, he
[1:38:14] that's in you, than he that is IN THE
[1:38:16] WORLD. IT'S NOT US FIGHTING THE DEVIL.
[1:38:18] THE LORD IS ON OUR SIDE.
[1:38:27] [sighs]
[1:38:28] LISTEN AT HIM IN EZEKIEL 28:2, "Son of
[1:38:31] man, say unto the prince of Tyrus, thus
[1:38:35] saith the Lord God,
[1:38:37] because thine heart is lifted up, thou
[1:38:40] hast said, I am a god,
[1:38:43] and I sit in the seat of God."
[1:38:49] This must have been a scary time,
[1:38:51] brother Jason, when a man on the earth
[1:38:53] was saying this so personified by the
[1:38:56] traits of Satan himself that Satan could
[1:38:59] speak out of him.
[1:39:04] I said as God, because thine heart is
[1:39:07] lifted up, oh yet thou art a man and not
[1:39:12] God,
[1:39:14] though thou hast set thine heart as the
[1:39:17] heart of God.
[1:39:21] Behold, thou art wiser than Daniel,
[1:39:29] and there is no secret they can hide
[1:39:34] from thee.
[1:39:38] Oh my goodness.
[1:39:41] And you say, and you preacher, you
[1:39:43] little old two before preacher
[1:39:45] standing up there and telling us that
[1:39:47] we're greater than him, not so much our
[1:39:50] flesh. But the God that's in us,
[1:39:55] THE GOD THAT'S IN US.
[1:39:59] SO HE WANTS TO BLIND PEOPLE.
[1:40:03] [snorts]
[1:40:04] But Paul again says in Ephesians 6:11,
[1:40:07] PUT ON THE WHOLE armor of God. And the
[1:40:11] word put on is in duo, which means to
[1:40:15] envelop in or to hide in and to close
[1:40:22] where you are on the inside.
[1:40:25] So put on
[1:40:26] the whole armor of God,
[1:40:29] right?
[1:40:30] THAT YOU MIGHT BE ABLE to withstand all
[1:40:32] THE POWERS IN THIS. SO HERE IS THE
[1:40:34] POPOLY. THIS IS THE GREEK WORD POPOLY OF
[1:40:38] GOD. THE WHOLE ARMOR. Isn't it amazing?
[1:40:41] Now, Paul is writing to Christians that
[1:40:43] are sounds like substantial people. They
[1:40:45] understand a lot about the word. The
[1:40:47] Ephesus church is one of the greatest
[1:40:48] churches in the NEW TESTAMENT. BUT PAUL
[1:40:50] HAS TO INSTRUCT THEM. Even though
[1:40:53] THEY'RE BORN AGAIN, EVEN THOUGH THEY'RE
[1:40:55] serving the Lord, they still have to put
[1:40:57] on the armor of God.
[1:41:01] See, that's a downside about having a
[1:41:03] preacher that sweats real bad. He drowns
[1:41:05] these things out.
[1:41:09] So now watch. I'm going to envelop my
[1:41:13] upper torso.
[1:41:26] That's what I was trying to say. I just
[1:41:27] didn't become Superman. [laughter]
[1:41:31] Except I'm not Clark Ken. I'm Donnie
[1:41:32] Reagan.
[1:41:33] All right.
[1:41:35] NOW, DID THIS COAT change my looks, my
[1:41:38] appearance?
[1:41:39] Yeah, you said it did because it's the
[1:41:41] only dry thread on you. Yeah. Well, it
[1:41:43] did. It changed ME. NOW, NOW WHENEVER I
[1:41:45] STAND HERE LIKE THIS, YOU KNOW THAT THIS
[1:41:47] IS A three-piece suit, right? Pants,
[1:41:50] vest, and all that. Comes from South
[1:41:51] Carolina, old brother Fred's place. AND
[1:41:53] WHENEVER I PUT THIS ON, THIS GIVES ME A
[1:41:57] sign to you able to SEE AS WELL THAT I
[1:42:00] LOOK MORE FULLY DRESSED THAN I WAS
[1:42:03] BEFORE. NOW I WAS DRESSED, WAS I NOT?
[1:42:06] BUT NOW I LOOK MORE FULLY DRESSED
[1:42:08] BECAUSE I WALK OUT OF HERE AND YOU see
[1:42:10] me with this coat ON IT AND THEN YOU
[1:42:12] KNOW, WELL, he took the coat off. WELL,
[1:42:13] THE ORIGINAL CHURCH WAS A FULLY DRESSED
[1:42:16] CHURCH. THEY HAD THE WORD, THEY HAD
[1:42:18] SIGNS, THEY HAD THE SUPERNATURAL, THEY
[1:42:20] had the revelation of THE MYSTERIES OF
[1:42:22] GOD, AND THEN WHAT DID SATAN DO? LITTLE
[1:42:24] BY LITTLE, HE BEGAN TO PULL THIS OFF OF
[1:42:27] THEM AND THAT OFF OF [screaming] THEM.
[1:42:28] SO THE PROPHET SAW HIM IN THE LAST DAYS,
[1:42:30] AND THERE STOOD THE CHURCH TOTALLY
[1:42:31] NAKED. AND WHAT DID GOD DO? GOD SENT A
[1:42:34] PROPHET NOT JUST TO PUT INTELLECT IN HER
[1:42:37] HEAD AND NOT JUST TO GIVE US A BUNCH OF
[1:42:39] EMOTION, BUT HE SENT A PROPHET TO BE
[1:42:41] ABLE TO DRESS THE BRIDE. REDRESS HER IN
[1:42:44] WHAT? IN BRANDONISM, [screaming]
[1:42:45] IN REAGANISM? NO. IN THE GARMENTS OF THE
[1:42:48] WORD THAT THE BRIDE WILL BE ABLE TO
[1:42:51] STAND THERE IN THE PANOPOLY OF GOD AND
[1:42:53] LOOK TO DEVIL IN THE FACE AND SAY, "OUT
[1:42:55] OF MY WAY, SATAN.
[1:43:00] Thank God.
[1:43:04] Can I take this off?
[1:43:07] I'm not getting rid of my armor now.
[1:43:08] Just my coat.
[1:43:12] I'm still foolish enough after 40 years.
[1:43:18] I've been preaching 48
[1:43:21] and I'm still dumb enough to believe, if
[1:43:24] you want to call it that, that God's
[1:43:26] prophet said a man or woman can live so
[1:43:29] completely surrendered to God
[1:43:32] that the devil don't know what to do
[1:43:33] with it.
[1:43:37] You imagine you getting up in the war.
[1:43:39] [snorts]
[1:43:42] Your hair is sticking up all over its
[1:43:43] head. If you got any, [panting]
[1:43:46] you got a bad breath.
[1:43:49] [gasps and sighs]
[1:43:50] You go in there. Oh, God.
[1:43:54] It's Monday.
[1:43:56] Oh, I'm going back to bed.
[1:43:59] Oh, Lord have mercy.
[1:44:00] I know my boss is going to get me. It
[1:44:03] don't matter if you're a plumber, if
[1:44:04] you're a painter, if you're a catalytic
[1:44:05] converter guy, if you're a preacher,
[1:44:07] whatever you are, the devil hates you,
[1:44:09] don't he? If you're a housewife, if
[1:44:11] you're a factory worker, it don't matter
[1:44:12] what you are. And he don't hate you
[1:44:14] because you come to the church. He don't
[1:44:17] to that one now, too. HE DON'T HATE YOU
[1:44:19] JUST BECAUSE YOU PROFESS THIS MESSAGE.
[1:44:21] BUT HE SEES SOMETHING IN YOU THAT IS
[1:44:24] GREATER THAN YOURSELF. IT'S NOT US. IT'S
[1:44:27] NOT ME. WE GOT SPARES, BROTHERS. IT'S
[1:44:30] NOT [screaming] ME. IT'S NOT YOU. IT'S
[1:44:32] OUR FATHER THAT LIVES INSIDE OF US AND
[1:44:36] HE CANNOT STOP US BECAUSE WE ARE GOD'S
[1:44:40] PEOPLE. WE ARE UNSTOPPABLE. YOU ARE
[1:44:44] UNDEFEABLE. YOU ARE MORE THAN A
[1:44:46] CONQUEROR. YOU ARE GREATER than sin. YOU
[1:44:50] ARE GREATER THAN SICKNESS.
[1:44:57] Thank you, Jesus.
[1:44:59] Hallelujah. mention and that prophet
[1:45:01] would look in their people's life in the
[1:45:03] fourth dimension. Which one do I use? My
[1:45:05] lord
[1:45:10] and that fourth dimension, he'd say,
[1:45:14] "I see you got a cancer.
[1:45:17] Wait a minute. Wait a minute. [snorts]
[1:45:19] It left her.
[1:45:22] You sitting back there, you've also got
[1:45:25] a cancer.
[1:45:27] Can't you hear them?
[1:45:30] So he's not only seeing in that
[1:45:31] dimension, but he's sharing them.
[1:45:33] Amen.
[1:45:34] Now that devil and that woman got
[1:45:36] scared, and this devil and this woman
[1:45:38] got scared,
[1:45:39] and apparently he's getting scared
[1:45:41] again. That's why he's working on these
[1:45:42] microphones.
[1:45:44] SO WHAT WOULD THEY DO? THEY WOULD TELL
[1:45:46] on each other.
[1:45:50] SO THIS DEVIL UP HERE, HELP ME.
[1:45:53] HELP [screaming] ME.
[1:45:54] LORD HAVE MERCY, CHILDREN. IF YOU CAN
[1:45:57] ONLY REALIZE THAT'S WHY THEY ATTACK YOU.
[1:46:02] WE THINK IT'S US SCARED. IT'S US
[1:46:04] RUNNING. IT SHOULDN'T BE.
[1:46:06] IT SHOULD BE US TORMENTING THEM DEVILS.
[1:46:09] IT SHOULD BE THEM SAID, "SOMEBODY PLEASE
[1:46:11] come and help me. SOMEBODY PLEASE COME
[1:46:13] AND HELP ME." THEM YOUNG WOMEN, THEM
[1:46:15] YOUNG MEN, THEY'RE SO FULL OF THE POWER
[1:46:17] OF GOD, THEY HAVEN'T FELT GOD IN TWO
[1:46:19] WEEKS, AND THEY'RE STILL STANDING STRONG
[1:46:21] ON THE WORD. THE DOCTOR GAVE THEM A BAD
[1:46:24] REPORT, BUT THEY STILL BELIEVE A WORD.
[1:46:26] SOMEBODY HELP ME. SOMEBODY HELP ME.
[1:46:32] [applause]
[1:46:35] NOW, look what they would do. So, this
[1:46:37] scared devil would call out to that
[1:46:39] devil,
[1:46:40] right?
[1:46:41] Wherever it was back there,
[1:46:42] they would form a communication line.
[1:46:46] Now, what it was, it was a dark streak.
[1:46:48] Yeah,
[1:46:49] they might have thought there wireless,
[1:46:50] but you can't hide from the eyes of a
[1:46:52] prophet.
[1:46:55] They were wireless communication, but it
[1:46:58] just so happened God had one with fourth
[1:46:59] dimension goggles on and he looked right
[1:47:01] at it and saw a black shriek from this
[1:47:03] woman to that woman. Other times he'd
[1:47:05] see one going all OVER THE CHURCH. WHAT
[1:47:07] WAS IT? THEM DEVILS SAY, "HELP ME. HELP
[1:47:09] ME. HELP ME." HOW MANY KNOW WHEN YOU
[1:47:12] COME TO THE HOUSE OF GOD, IT'S SOMETIMES
[1:47:14] THE WORST BATTLES YOU'VE EVER FOUGHT IN
[1:47:16] YOUR LIFE.
[1:47:17] YOUR MIND WILL GO TO WALMART. IT'LL GO
[1:47:19] TO MAKING A CINNAMON ROLL RECIPE OR
[1:47:21] SOMETHING TO EAT AFTER CHURCH. WHO'S
[1:47:23] DOING THAT TO YOU? IT'S THE DEVIL. WHY?
[1:47:26] HE'S SEEN GOD ANOINT YOUR PASTOR. HE
[1:47:28] SEES THE DIRECTION THAT GOD'S PUT ON HIS
[1:47:31] HEART AND HE SAYS, "OH, I CAN'T STOP HIM
[1:47:33] FROM PREACHING IT, BUT I'LL BUSY their
[1:47:35] minds. I'll busy their minds."
[1:47:39] All of a sudden, you're saying, "Oh,
[1:47:40] praise the Lord. Oh, Jesus. This is just
[1:47:43] what I need." And here comes the
[1:47:45] thought. You didn't unplug the crockpot.
[1:47:57] [clears throat]
[1:47:58] I thought I did,
[1:48:02] but to be honest, I cannot remember.
[1:48:04] [laughter]
[1:48:05] And there you sat and the next 15
[1:48:08] minutes
[1:48:09] was your 15.
[1:48:14] Amen. Amen.
[1:48:16] Oh my goodness.
[1:48:18] Let's stand.
[1:48:21] Let's stand.
[1:48:26] Tomorrow night we will have waterproof
[1:48:27] microphones.
[1:48:34] Oh my.
[1:48:38] Oh children,
[1:48:42] think of God's mercy to us poor mortals.
[1:48:46] when we are living in the worst age
[1:48:49] that's ever been.
[1:48:51] The prophet tells us in 1961 that the
[1:48:53] lid has been tore off the kettle
[1:48:55] and demon demon powers are streaming in
[1:48:58] every direction.
[1:49:00] The opening of the seals not only
[1:49:02] released the power of God,
[1:49:04] but can you imagine hell?
[1:49:07] The angels of God were gathered around
[1:49:09] the tabernacle. I believe, Brother
[1:49:10] Jason,
[1:49:12] cuz they was hearing things they had
[1:49:13] never heard since the foundation of the
[1:49:15] world.
[1:49:16] Secrets of redemption they never heard.
[1:49:18] But I guarantee you, they weren't the
[1:49:20] only thing there at that tabernacle.
[1:49:22] Demons were gathered. They were
[1:49:24] listening. They were learning. Finding
[1:49:27] the facet, the aspect by which they
[1:49:30] could try to divide the people in this
[1:49:31] message was what? Quotes. Of course.
[1:49:35] quotes.
[1:49:39] Then by the time the prophet preaches in
[1:49:41] in 1965,
[1:49:43] God of [clears throat] this evil age,
[1:49:45] preaches, God of this evil age, Satan's
[1:49:46] eating, those great ones right there in
[1:49:48] the last couple of months. And he stood
[1:49:51] there and he said, "There's two spirits
[1:49:54] in the world [music] today.
[1:49:56] One worshiping God by science,
[1:49:59] education, civilization."
[1:50:02] Uhhuh. And he said the other one
[1:50:03] worshiping God by revelation.
[1:50:07] And he says this to the Brandham
[1:50:09] tabernacle. [music] He says both of
[1:50:11] those spirits
[1:50:13] are right in this church today.
[1:50:18] So by then Satan had already made a big
[1:50:21] move where [music] to get around the
[1:50:23] ranks
[1:50:24] of the message.
[1:50:27] Sure. [music] cuz he knows if we ever
[1:50:30] know who we are and who he is,
[1:50:32] we are an undefeable army.
[1:50:36] We'll always have differences. Of course
[1:50:37] we will.
[1:50:39] But brother, sister, I think the closer
[1:50:41] we get to the end of the way, we're
[1:50:42] going to become like Geronimo was.
[1:50:45] They killed the Apaches right and left.
[1:50:48] Make treaties with them and broke it.
[1:50:49] Made another one and broke it.
[1:50:51] Some of the Apache guides actually led
[1:50:56] [snorts] the American army to capture
[1:50:59] Geronimo.
[1:51:00] Then they took their arms from them.
[1:51:02] They stripped them of their identity and
[1:51:04] put them on the same train to Florida
[1:51:07] that they put Gono on. Some of them same
[1:51:09] men that led them to him [music]
[1:51:12] and they captured them. And now they had
[1:51:13] to look him in the face. And Geronimo
[1:51:16] looked at them and said, "There's too
[1:51:18] few of us to fight each other now.
[1:51:23] Let's stand together."
[1:51:24] Yes. [music]
[1:51:26] We'll be always different. We will. Of
[1:51:27] course we will. Some of y'all like
[1:51:29] vanilla ice cream. Some of you like
[1:51:31] chocolate. Some of you like coffee. God
[1:51:34] have mercy on you. [laughter]
[1:51:39] Some of you like broccoli. God double
[1:51:41] where I stand on that stuff.
[1:51:44] Will we have difference? Well, how did
[1:51:45] they act at the day of Pentecost? Are we
[1:51:47] supposed to be more emotional or less
[1:51:48] emotional? We'll always have those
[1:51:49] things. But look around.
[1:51:52] The day is getting darker.
[1:51:53] Amen.
[1:51:54] Amen.
[1:51:54] IT'S GETTING DARKER. WE'RE MORE
[1:51:56] OPPRESSED THAN WE'VE EVER BEEN IF WE
[1:51:57] ever needed one another.
[1:52:00] We need one another now.
[1:52:03] And Satan is doing his best to divide
[1:52:05] us, separate us.
[1:52:08] Why? [music]
[1:52:10] His intelligence tells him his demons.
[1:52:14] I hope you don't think I'm crazy, but
[1:52:17] when there I'm going through certain
[1:52:18] things, I will not even say that out
[1:52:22] loud
[1:52:23] to the Lord.
[1:52:27] You say, "That's crazy, is it?"
[1:52:29] Apparently, you've never heard the
[1:52:30] quote. Question answer 64. Brother
[1:52:31] Brandham, you told us the first time you
[1:52:33] went to Arizona. Now you've went again.
[1:52:35] Why do you tell? He said, "Well, that's
[1:52:36] in my heart." Yeah.
[1:52:37] And he said, "As long as it's in my
[1:52:39] heart, if I say it, [music] Satan will
[1:52:41] hear it."
[1:52:42] That's right.
[1:52:43] Do you understand? When you get down,
[1:52:44] sometimes he don't know how effective he
[1:52:46] is against you until you say, "God, I
[1:52:48] can't go another day. I'm at the end of
[1:52:50] my rope." DON'T SAY THAT.
[1:52:52] YOU'RE TELLING THE DEVIL, YOU'RE
[1:52:54] REPORTING TO THE DEVIL YOU'RE JUST ABOUT
[1:52:56] WHIPPED.
[1:52:58] BUT DONNIE, WHAT IF I FEEL THAT?
[1:53:00] WELL, he's the kind of God that you
[1:53:02] don't even have to say it.
[1:53:04] Wow.
[1:53:05] You just grown. Oh.
[1:53:07] Oh. Oh my.
[1:53:09] AND SATAN SAID, "WHAT HE SAY? WHAT HE
[1:53:10] SAY?" OH.
[1:53:12] OH.
[1:53:14] THE DEVIL CAN'T UNDERSTAND THAT KIND OF
[1:53:15] LANGUAGE.
[1:53:17] OH. HALLELUJAH.
[1:53:18] BUT THE LORD CAN HEAR IT
[1:53:20] WHEN YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT TO SAY.
[1:53:22] YOU ever been there? YOU DIDN'T EVEN
[1:53:23] KNOW WHAT TO SAY. YOU DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO
[1:53:25] ASK HIM. [music]
[1:53:26] HALLELUJAH.
[1:53:28] Oh Lord God my
[1:53:32] hallelujah.
[1:53:35] So we want to serve notice on the
[1:53:37] kingdom of hell tonight.
[1:53:39] Your [music] days are numbered.
[1:53:44] And we are more than [music] conquerors.
[1:53:47] When I get there that day, I don't want
[1:53:48] the Lord Jesus to hand me a t-shirt and
[1:53:51] say, "I survived [music]
[1:53:53] the hill to
[1:53:54] Hallelujah.
[1:53:55] I want to be a conqueror."
[1:53:58] Amen.
[1:53:58] Hope this don't offend you. I already am
[1:54:01] one.
[1:54:03] I ain't hoping for the sweet by and by.
[1:54:05] I'm a conqueror today.
[1:54:07] Oh, you've heard the story Muhammad Ali.
[1:54:09] My my how he could fight and how he
[1:54:11] could box and he done all that sort of
[1:54:13] thing. You've probably heard it told
[1:54:14] before. He was a conqueror. He would
[1:54:16] sweat and he would run and he would
[1:54:20] do all this stuff and he'd go out and
[1:54:22] win the fight and his wife would come in
[1:54:25] and hold out her hand.
[1:54:29] He was a conqueror. She was more than a
[1:54:32] conqueror.
[1:54:33] Amen.
[1:54:33] She didn't run. She didn't sweat. She
[1:54:36] didn't have to watch what she She didn't
[1:54:37] have to do all that. He done all the
[1:54:39] fighting. Oh, hallelujah. If we could
[1:54:41] get it out of our minds. Oh, my me me.
[1:54:43] IT AIN'T YOU. IT AIN'T HOW STRONG YOU
[1:54:45] ARE. IT AIN'T HOW GREAT I AM. IT'S HOW
[1:54:48] GREAT OUR HUSBAND IS. IT'S HOW GREAT OUR
[1:54:51] LORD JESUS IS.
[1:54:53] And what he does, he gives us the
[1:54:55] benefit and said, "Here, sweetheart.
[1:54:58] Here's your old checkbook.
[1:55:00] You need healing. Sign your name with
[1:55:02] mine. [sighs] You need deliverance. You
[1:55:04] need peace.
[1:55:06] [music] What do you need here tonight?
[1:55:08] What do you need? Oh, you saying he
[1:55:10] ain't real? No, no, no, no, no. The
[1:55:12] devil is real.
[1:55:14] Oh, I tell you one thing. I wouldn't
[1:55:16] want to meet him five minutes by myself.
[1:55:19] Without the Lord Jesus, no way.
[1:55:22] But with the Lord Jesus on my side,
[1:55:24] Brother Mark, we'll meet him.
[1:55:26] We'll meet him together.
[1:55:28] We've been made more than coner.
[1:55:34] Sing it now. Overcomers in this [music]
[1:55:38] valley.
[1:55:41] Amen. We've been made
[1:55:45] victorious. [music]

[1:56:00] [singing]

[1:56:05] need help with a disease in your body.
[1:56:09] Maybe you're fighting depression
[1:56:11] and reexia. Bulimia. Oh, [music] there's
[1:56:14] help for you tonight. You're more than a
[1:56:17] conqueror
[1:56:19] through the blood of [music and singing]
[1:56:21] Jesus Christ.
[1:56:23] Everybody with all your heart, close
[1:56:25] your eyes, raise your hands in the
[1:56:28] presence of God.
[1:56:30] We're more than conquerors. Lord Jesus,
[1:56:33] oh

[1:56:41] the bride is made [singing]
[1:56:43] [music] victorious
[1:56:48] through the [music] blood of Jesus
[1:56:51] Christ.
[1:56:53] Let this be your confession. [music]
[1:56:55] We've been

[1:57:51] Christ. [singing]
[1:57:54] [music]
[1:57:56] Hallelujah.
[1:57:58] Oh, give the Lord a hand this evening.
[1:58:00] My [applause]
[1:58:03] wow.
[1:58:07] [applause]
[1:58:09] Amen. And you know, I I I never cease to
[1:58:13] en to enjoy
[1:58:15] at how much it torments the devil for
[1:58:20] prophets and preachers to get before
[1:58:23] God's people and divulge all this top
[1:58:26] secret military intelligence that the
[1:58:29] devil don't want you to know.
[1:58:30] AMEN. IT REALLY UPSET HIM WHEN ISAIAH
[1:58:33] outed him like that cuz he thought
[1:58:35] nobody knew his secret ambition until a
[1:58:38] prophet busted him.
[1:58:40] HALLELUJAH. YOU MIGHT HAVE CAME HERE
[1:58:42] TONIGHT AND THE DEVIL THOUGHT HE HAD IT
[1:58:43] OVER ON YOU, BUT YOU HEARD A MAN OF GOD
[1:58:45] ACTUALLY TELL YOU HE REALLY AIN'T
[1:58:47] NOBODY.
[1:58:49] YOU HAVE THE ONLY SOMEBODY.
[1:58:52] YOU BELIEVE THAT TONIGHT?
[1:58:54] My my goodness. How many enjoyed the
[1:58:57] word of God?
[1:58:59] Oh, you know, I [applause]
[1:59:02] I thought to myself,
[1:59:06] man, for all the all the yelling and
[1:59:08] hallelujah and glory, I'm I might have
[1:59:10] preached half of that sermon. I might
[1:59:12] deserve a little bit of that credit.
[1:59:13] Amen. Cuz I was woo wow, my throat feels
[1:59:17] like I just got done preaching.
[1:59:20] You know, I thought about how that and
[1:59:22] [clears throat] it really gripped me
[1:59:25] cuz I thought about how that,
[1:59:28] you know, and and and and this is just
[1:59:30] me. This is just Brother Jason. But I I
[1:59:33] couldn't help but but think in my mind,
[1:59:35] surely those angels
[1:59:38] who heard that first counter sermon from
[1:59:42] the devil. It was MAYBE NOT REALLY
[1:59:45] RADICALLY DIFFERENT, but just a little
[1:59:48] that's a little different. SEE, CUZ
[1:59:50] THAT'S HOW YOU SAY, "WHY WOULD YOU THINK
[1:59:51] HE DONE IT THAT WAY?" CUZ I know that's
[1:59:52] how he works now.
[1:59:54] AND I I WOULD ALMOST be willing to to
[1:59:58] imagine in my mind that those angels who
[2:00:01] started following him never really
[2:00:04] imagined how evil and dark he would
[2:00:07] become until it was too late.
[2:00:11] And I'll tell you something, friends,
[2:00:12] young people, that's the way Satan does.
[2:00:14] He'll start out and you will never
[2:00:16] imagine how far he'll take you. It'll
[2:00:18] start out sounding so appealing. It was
[2:00:21] be a little different from the word, but
[2:00:23] down the road, you mark it down the
[2:00:25] road, he'll get you so far, and you'll
[2:00:27] never have imagined that a being could
[2:00:29] got you to go that far. I'm glad there
[2:00:32] is a real Lord and a real God and a real
[2:00:35] Christ.
[2:00:36] Oh, friends, I'm glad we've got the word
[2:00:38] of God as our defense tonight. No wonder
[2:00:40] the brother Brandham said, "Stay behind
[2:00:42] it. Stay fortified behind the word. It
[2:00:45] it's it's what God has sent to save us,
[2:00:48] to heal us, to fill us with his
[2:00:50] presence, TO GIVE YOU A BODY CHANGE.
[2:00:54] AMEN. Think about that, friends. You
[2:00:56] tonight
[2:00:58] are part of that privileged people
[2:01:00] who have come already.
[2:01:03] Paul said in Hebrews 12, you have come.
[2:01:06] Not you're coming, NOT SOMEDAY YOU'RE
[2:01:08] GOING TO A REAL CITY, BUT YOU'VE ALREADY
[2:01:10] COME TO THAT CITY, a holy Jerusalem.
[2:01:13] You've already come among just MEN MADE
[2:01:16] PERFECT. YOU'VE ALREADY COME TO angels
[2:01:19] and a heavenly host. You're already
[2:01:21] there right now by the new birth. Isn't
[2:01:23] that a beautiful concept?
[2:01:25] My
[2:01:26] We've been made more than [music] coner.
[2:01:33] Oh, overcomeers [music] in this in this
[2:01:37] life. Oh, do you believe it? For this
[2:01:40] life. [music]
[2:01:41] Oh, we've been made
[2:01:44] victorious.
[2:01:47] Oh, yes. Through the blood of Jesus
[2:01:51] [music]
[2:01:52] Christ,
[2:01:53] we've been made more. Oh, we've been
[2:01:57] [music] made more than conquerors.
[2:02:01] Hallelujah.
[2:02:03] Overcomers [music]
[2:02:05] in this in this life. Lord my [music]
[2:02:09] thank you Jesus. We've been made.
[2:02:15] [singing and music]
[2:02:17] Oh through the blood through the blood
[2:02:21] of Jesus Christ. Sing it one more time
[2:02:23] now. [music] Oh we've been made for the
[2:02:28] coner.

[2:05:37] Father, we're very grateful tonight.
[2:05:39] Lord, you you never fail. Lord, you to
[2:05:44] bring everything that we expect. Lord,
[2:05:46] you never disappoint. You always come in
[2:05:49] a great and mighty way, a meaningful
[2:05:51] way, Lord. Now, I know tonight, Lord,
[2:05:53] that we heard your word. Now, Lord,
[2:05:56] there's there's evil forces that are
[2:06:00] very much resenting what was preached
[2:06:02] tonight AND THEY'RE RESENTING ANYBODY
[2:06:04] WHO would believe it. So, Father, I pray
[2:06:07] that you will put strength and faith in
[2:06:10] the hearts of your people. That's really
[2:06:12] what the devil's afraid of, Lord. HE'S
[2:06:14] AFRAID SOMEBODY WILL CATCH a hold of
[2:06:16] faith and bring forth a promise and
[2:06:19] he'll lose his grip. Lord, I pray that
[2:06:21] that will be the effect of this word
[2:06:23] that was heard tonight, not only in this
[2:06:25] meeting and standing in this building
[2:06:27] tonight out across the airwaves and when
[2:06:29] we leave THIS MEETING AND GO TO OUR
[2:06:31] HOMES AND TOMORROW we rise. Lord, may
[2:06:33] there be your family that'll that'll
[2:06:36] know a greater level of victory and
[2:06:38] freedom and overcoming, Father, than
[2:06:40] perhaps they were even today and every
[2:06:43] day after. Lord, may it just get greater
[2:06:46] unto that perfect day that we're looking
[2:06:48] forward to. We thank you for all of our
[2:06:50] visitors. Thank you for Lord all the
[2:06:53] work and the hard work that's went in to
[2:06:55] make these meetings possible. Thank you
[2:06:57] for loaning us your servant, Lord. And I
[2:07:00] pray now that you will begin immediately
[2:07:02] to resupply him with the strength, Lord,
[2:07:05] and the anointing and the leadership of
[2:07:07] the word of God because we're going to
[2:07:09] come right back here tomorrow. And Lord,
[2:07:11] Lord, we just want to we just want to
[2:07:12] put heaven on notice now. We're going to
[2:07:14] need a fresh batch tomorrow. We're not
[2:07:17] going to be satisfied with what we got
[2:07:18] tonight, Lord. We're going to need a
[2:07:20] fresh batch tomorrow. So bring it to us,
[2:07:23] Father, the word that we will have need
[2:07:25] of. And I pray, master, that you'll the
[2:07:28] the night will go into the late hours
[2:07:30] and you'll still be chasing devils over
[2:07:32] the hill and away from us. May you grant
[2:07:34] it to us, Lord. We commit it now to you,
[2:07:36] Father. The for the refreshments that
[2:07:39] we'll receive outside in the fellowship.
[2:07:41] I pray, Lord, that you'll just take your
[2:07:44] abode right among us. Move among us and
[2:07:46] enjoy seeing your family, Lord. Your
[2:07:49] family fellowshipping one another,
[2:07:50] breaking bread together, talking of the
[2:07:53] good things of God. May you bless the
[2:07:54] food, Lord, and may it give us
[2:07:56] nourishment and strength. And then take
[2:07:58] us home, Lord, safely bring us back
[2:08:01] tomorrow at the appointed hour. We thank
[2:08:03] you for it all in Jesus' name. Amen.
