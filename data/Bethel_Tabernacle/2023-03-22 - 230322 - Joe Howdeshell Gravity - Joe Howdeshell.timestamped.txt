[11:07] and I hear words so cutting
[11:13] and though different from what I've

[11:27] and in all that you desire
[11:32] let me never turn away

[12:05] your will in me fulfilled
[12:09] and if it matters to you Lord that's
[12:15] what I'm willing to be
[12:22] now he knows that we are human
[12:26] and he knows our Frailty
[12:32] and he knows that we could never
[12:36] on our own his will to be
[12:41] oh but that's why he lives within us why
[12:46] we must give him all our life
[12:50] all he asks is full surrender and walk
[12:56] daily by his side
[13:01] [Applause]
[13:03] if it matters to you Lord let it matters

[13:20] lovingly
[13:23] for you are my everything

[24:15] while you're standing
[24:17] let's turn to Psalm 119.
[24:22] verse 59.
[24:26] so good to be in the house of the Lord
[24:27] tonight
[24:31] it was a little bit of a
[24:33] uh kind of a short notice brother Matt
[24:37] wasn't feeling well he had to work over
[24:39] on Hilton Head and he asked me if I
[24:41] could fill in so
[24:43] I said well brother he said the Lord
[24:45] just gave him the unction so I said well
[24:47] I wouldn't go over that for nothing so
[24:48] let's
[24:49] amen
[24:51] and after you see the title of my
[24:53] message you'll know that the Lord's
[24:55] already working tonight just by the song
[24:57] Choices that
[25:01] amen
[25:02] verse 59 I thought on my ways
[25:05] and turn my feet unto thy testimonies
[25:09] let's bow our heads Heavenly Father
[25:12] Lord we're so thankful to be here
[25:14] tonight
[25:16] words can't express it Lord to be able
[25:19] to come and just
[25:21] be able to Fellowship Lord in in Freedom
[25:25] in a nice place Lord to gather together
[25:27] with people Lord of Light precious faith
[25:31] Lord we don't count that as a light
[25:33] thing Lord I hope we never take it for
[25:35] granted
[25:36] God we're so thankful to be here tonight
[25:38] and we're just looking and expecting
[25:40] Lord for you to speak to us in a mighty
[25:43] way
[25:44] father we commit this service to you
[25:46] tonight we just have many requests Lord
[25:48] that will bring to you tonight after the
[25:50] service
[25:51] and God would just ask that you would
[25:53] just help me to step out of the way Lord
[25:55] and may you speak in Jesus name we pray
[25:58] amen you can be seated
[26:03] now David is speaking here
[26:06] he said I thought on my ways and turned
[26:08] my feet unto my testimonies
[26:12] and brother Branham said he kind of gave
[26:13] a little
[26:14] a little bit of a
[26:17] um what you would call he called it a
[26:19] panoramic but I guess you could call it
[26:21] a um
[26:22] uh kind of a story that he told him but
[26:25] he talked about how that David was was
[26:27] running from Saul and Saul was after him
[26:29] and he said I could see David was maybe
[26:32] holed up in a house and he was pacing
[26:34] the floor
[26:35] and said every now and then he would go
[26:37] and he would open the lattice and he
[26:38] would look out and he was nervous and he
[26:40] was ringing his hands knowing that Saul
[26:42] was after him
[26:43] and he said that that knowing that any
[26:46] moment that an arrow could come through
[26:48] and Pierce his bosom
[26:50] and he said he got into thinking on his
[26:52] way
[26:53] and he said it's so sad many times that
[26:56] it takes trouble and it takes hardship
[26:59] for you and I to get to a point to where
[27:02] we really start reflecting on our way
[27:06] but that's okay
[27:07] because we sing that song Whatever It
[27:09] Takes Lord
[27:10] whatever it takes for my will to break
[27:13] sometimes God has to get us to a place
[27:15] to where we'll finally call out to him
[27:18] and I don't discount that at all but
[27:21] wouldn't it be great if we could just
[27:22] serve him all the time
[27:24] when the hard times come you're already
[27:25] ready you already prayed up you stayed
[27:28] up you studied up and when the enemy
[27:30] comes in like a flood the Lord's right
[27:32] there to raise up a standard against him
[27:34] but David you know he was thinking on
[27:36] his way and I was thinking many times
[27:38] I've got into situations myself and I've
[27:42] been maybe floating along I've been kind
[27:45] of complacent does anybody else ever get
[27:47] complacent in life
[27:49] you know complacency and I just wrote
[27:52] this down
[27:54] it comes from a place of not caring
[27:57] not being motivated
[27:59] not convinced
[28:01] it says I have time
[28:04] see maybe sometimes you think you got a
[28:06] little more time than what you do have
[28:08] and so you get a little complacent you
[28:11] get a little lacks in your Bible study
[28:13] you get a lacks in your church
[28:15] attendance you get a little lacks in
[28:18] your fellowship
[28:19] you get a little lacks into things that
[28:21] you start watching or the things that
[28:23] you start listening to you start letting
[28:25] down the bars
[28:26] brother Branham used to have a saying we
[28:28] let down the bars and let down the bars
[28:31] and would compromise with sin
[28:33] we let down the bars and the Sheep got
[28:35] out but how did the goats get in
[28:38] now I know any of you listen to tapes
[28:39] I've heard that many times
[28:41] but it's so true
[28:43] if you let down your standards if you
[28:46] let down then something's going to fill
[28:48] that vacuum
[28:50] if you don't keep it filled up with the
[28:52] word of God if you don't keep the Bible
[28:54] says to continually to have Psalms and
[28:58] spiritual hymns and these things going
[29:00] on in our minds not to fill it up with
[29:03] the garbage of this world
[29:05] see
[29:07] brother were y'all able to get that
[29:08] PowerPoint I sent it to an email but I
[29:10] don't know if you could get it or not
[29:13] Bethel Tabernacle at the sound booth
[29:16] okay that that's fine it's not a big
[29:19] deal short notice so we'll just we'll
[29:22] just go with it
[29:23] I told my wife I said I'm gonna grab my
[29:25] Bible and just go
[29:28] and that's the best way to be be instant
[29:30] in season out of season
[29:32] I tell you one thing you better be
[29:34] because you know what you don't always
[29:36] have a whole lot of time to be prepared
[29:41] but you know what
[29:43] better than a PowerPoint is the power of
[29:45] the Holy Ghost amen
[29:48] Lord just give me that tonight
[29:50] that's all I need amen
[29:53] whatever it takes Lord if it's laying me
[29:56] on my back if it's if it's causing me to
[29:58] lose my job lose my home
[30:00] children straying away all kinds of
[30:04] troubles come to us
[30:06] and we start thinking on our way
[30:09] we start maybe Trouble Comes maybe you
[30:11] got a diagnosis from a doctor
[30:14] maybe you just don't have the joy that
[30:17] you used to have
[30:18] all kinds of things can happen in your
[30:21] life and trouble sets in
[30:23] I'm so glad that we have a place that we
[30:25] can run to tonight
[30:28] we have a bomb in Gilead we've got a
[30:31] place that we can just run to amen
[30:34] God always makes a way
[30:36] he makes a way
[30:39] now I want to turn if you have your
[30:41] Bible take your Bibles and turn to first
[30:43] Samuel 30.
[30:44] we're going to read and we're going to
[30:46] see what else David did
[30:48] and this was so striking when I read
[30:50] this
[30:52] but David was running from Saul
[30:57] Chapter 30 verse 1
[31:00] and he had back he had been on the run
[31:03] so long that he even sided up with the
[31:05] Philistines for a little while
[31:06] things got so bad
[31:09] and it came to pass when David and his
[31:12] men were come to ziklag see David wanted
[31:14] to go fight but they wouldn't let him
[31:16] they're like well we're afraid if you
[31:17] get in the battle with us then you might
[31:19] turn around and and uh and uh attack our
[31:22] rear so they wouldn't let David come
[31:24] with them they they locked him and all
[31:25] but they didn't trust him
[31:29] came to pass when David and his men were
[31:31] come to zip lag on the third day that
[31:33] the amalekites had invaded the South and
[31:36] zeklag had smitten and burned it with
[31:39] fire now this is where he was holed up
[31:41] he went back to ziklag with a contingent
[31:44] of the Philistines
[31:45] and when he went when he got there the
[31:48] amalekites that came so the Philistines
[31:49] went out to fight Saul
[31:51] and while they were gone the amalekites
[31:53] came in to attack one of their cities
[31:56] and had taken the women captives that
[31:59] were therein they slew not any neither
[32:01] great or small but carry them away and
[32:03] went on their way wow could you imagine
[32:05] coming home and somebody had attacked
[32:09] your home and it burned your house down
[32:11] and it kidnapped your family
[32:13] you know we read these scriptures and we
[32:15] just kind of keep on reading but it's
[32:17] good to sometimes just stop and think
[32:19] for just a minute
[32:21] so this enemy had come in and had
[32:23] kidnapped their entire families all
[32:25] their wives all their children their
[32:27] daughters their sons were going to be
[32:29] slaves their daughters were going to be
[32:30] married off to the to the enemy
[32:33] it was a terrible time
[32:35] their homes were plundered and burned
[32:37] and destroyed
[32:39] my
[32:41] and just one one verse there
[32:44] and had taken the women captives and
[32:46] were therein they slew not in any either
[32:48] great or small but carry them away and
[32:51] went on their way
[32:52] so David and his men came to the city
[32:54] and behold it was burned with fire now
[32:56] the whole city was burned and their
[32:58] wives and their sons and their daughters
[33:00] were taking captives
[33:03] to be trafficked no doubt
[33:07] then David and the people that were with
[33:09] him lifted up their voice and wept
[33:12] until they had no more power to weep wow
[33:14] that was some crying they squawed and
[33:17] they squalled and they had and they
[33:18] squatted and had more tears left
[33:20] and Ken just was grieving anybody ever
[33:24] had that much grief in your life amen
[33:27] you just didn't feel like you could get
[33:28] one more SOB out
[33:30] I've been there that's where David was
[33:34] didn't have no more power to weep
[33:37] and David's two wives were taken
[33:39] captives
[33:40] a hint on him the jezraelitis and
[33:42] Abigail the wife of nabel the Carmelite
[33:46] she was really something now
[33:50] and David was greatly distressed
[33:53] for the people spake of stoning him
[33:55] because the soul of all the people was
[33:58] grieved every man for his sons and for
[34:00] his daughters but David
[34:02] this is the part that got me
[34:06] if that was today's
[34:09] situation
[34:12] a lot of times I know it says that David
[34:16] he went and bought some marijuana down
[34:19] at the Circle K
[34:22] it doesn't say that does it
[34:24] he went and got another prescription of
[34:26] Prozac
[34:28] everything was going so bad he had to
[34:30] find some relief somewhere
[34:33] he went down and he bought some
[34:34] Budweiser
[34:36] he went to the the Red Dot and bought
[34:38] him some liquor just to drown all of his
[34:40] sorrows
[34:42] huh
[34:44] it's not what it says
[34:46] it says that David encouraged himself
[34:49] in the Lord he is God
[34:54] I tell you right now we need to
[34:55] encourage ourselves and the Lord our God
[34:58] we need to lay down all the little
[35:00] besetting things that attack us day by
[35:02] day
[35:05] you know you can be addicted to gambling
[35:09] they got a hotline
[35:11] I have no idea how you get addicted to
[35:13] gambling
[35:15] but you can
[35:17] you can get addicted to all kinds of
[35:19] drugs
[35:20] pain medication alcohol
[35:23] pornography
[35:25] all these things and what all these
[35:27] things do they have a way of soothing
[35:29] your mind
[35:32] you see the devil has a false sense of
[35:36] soothing your soul
[35:40] he'll soothe it for just a little while
[35:44] and no if you ever known somebody who's
[35:47] addicted to cigarettes
[35:49] wait till they can't get one and see
[35:51] what happens
[35:54] it's like being around the Devil Himself
[35:57] they're so ill
[36:00] cantankerous
[36:01] I grew up with a whole family full of
[36:03] them
[36:04] and they'd run out of cigarettes and and
[36:06] I was like world war three
[36:08] it was terrible
[36:10] and what it was it was that demon
[36:13] that was plaguing them and harassing
[36:16] them until they satisfied that thing
[36:21] just as soon as they did everything was
[36:23] all right again
[36:24] puffing and a dragon
[36:28] but that's just about the way the devil
[36:30] does
[36:32] and no matter what the vice is in your
[36:34] life they all have a similar outcome
[36:39] it will harass you and it'll plague you
[36:43] until you give into it
[36:46] and then you go and you cry and ask the
[36:48] Lord to forgive you
[36:50] and he does
[36:51] why because he's faithful and he's true
[36:55] to forgive you
[36:59] many times
[37:01] we get caught up in maybe looking at
[37:05] something we shouldn't look at and I
[37:06] know it seems like I preach on this
[37:08] every time I get up here but there's an
[37:10] unction I Can't Describe there's a need
[37:13] that needs that needs to be met
[37:15] because we all have now we want the
[37:18] Dynamics to come into the church
[37:19] but there got to be a time when the
[37:22] mechanics are in line
[37:25] if you don't have the coil wire hooked
[37:27] up to the coil going to the distributor
[37:30] cap
[37:32] you're not gonna get no fire
[37:34] if you've got corrosion on the battery
[37:35] terminals you're not gonna get no fire
[37:39] if you're and and this is an old saying
[37:42] you watch a motor that starts missing
[37:44] pretty soon it stops and you look at
[37:46] people in the church when they start
[37:48] missing pretty soon they stop
[37:51] you don't see them anymore well where's
[37:53] Brother sewing so well
[37:55] he he quit he quit coming for a little
[37:57] while he started missing a lot of times
[37:59] I'll start backsliding all the way to
[38:01] the back door
[38:03] where they used to sit up at the front
[38:07] you can watch them
[38:09] start moving back and pretty soon to
[38:11] keep going back going back
[38:14] on out the back door
[38:17] I've watched it
[38:20] and so
[38:22] but what the devil wants to do is he
[38:24] wants to keep our minds saturated and
[38:28] occupied and entertained and in a
[38:31] drunken stupor because if you ever get
[38:34] convinced of what's getting ready to
[38:36] happen
[38:38] then you'll get concerned
[38:40] and that complacency will go out the
[38:43] window
[38:44] see
[38:46] many times we're not convinced
[38:49] oh we've heard it California is going to
[38:52] sink they make fun of it they even wrote
[38:55] a country song I bought some oceanfront
[38:57] property in California
[38:59] see
[39:02] I'm sorry Arizona
[39:04] that didn't make no sense oceanfront
[39:07] property in Arizona
[39:08] what is going to be one of these days
[39:10] ain't they
[39:12] but they want to make light of it
[39:16] and many times it's it's it's the old
[39:19] thing they'll even make fun of of of
[39:22] living holy they'll make fun of the
[39:23] Rapture they'll make fun of all of these
[39:25] things
[39:26] but one day they won't be making fun
[39:29] all the Laughing is going to stop one of
[39:31] these days ain't it
[39:35] David thought on his ways
[39:38] wonder if we could think on our ways
[39:39] tonight
[39:43] but here's the thing about it Satan has
[39:45] a gravity okay
[39:48] did it ever come up you never did get
[39:50] that that's fine don't worry about it
[39:51] the message that the title of what I was
[39:54] going to preach on is gravity
[39:56] and I thought about after the service
[39:57] singing that song I Feel the pool
[40:00] my brother Tony he beat me to it
[40:03] so we'll just have to sing something
[40:04] else
[40:07] so the devil has a gravity that
[40:09] continually tries to pull you down
[40:12] now anything that's that's trying to
[40:15] pull you down there's an old saying it's
[40:17] already under your feet see
[40:20] it's trying to pull you down it's a
[40:22] gravity it's a force
[40:24] and here's the I looked up the
[40:26] definition of gravity
[40:28] and it's a force that is pulling to a
[40:31] greater mass so if you're out in space
[40:34] and there's a planet the bigger the
[40:36] planet the more gravity it's going to
[40:37] have the more massive the planet not so
[40:40] much size but the mass of it will pull
[40:42] you into it
[40:44] now the devil's got a lot of mass out
[40:47] there
[40:48] and he's getting bigger and he's getting
[40:50] bigger and the Bible says Hell hath
[40:52] enlarged itself
[40:53] and we know that the spirit of
[40:55] antichrist is already here is brother
[40:56] Matt's been preaching that Spirit of
[40:59] antichrist is alive and well and it's
[41:01] working amongst the the world it's
[41:03] working amongst the church
[41:06] you see we have a three exoduses
[41:09] the first Exodus was uh Israelite of
[41:11] Egypt
[41:12] the second one was was the church out of
[41:15] Judaism
[41:17] but the third one is the bride being
[41:19] called out of denominationalism
[41:21] and see that's where that's where the
[41:23] rubber meets the road a lot of times
[41:25] that those spirits of denominationalism
[41:28] are still amongst the bride amongst this
[41:31] message not the bride but amongst this
[41:33] message churches
[41:38] but the complacency have you ever seen
[41:42] the uh that that gravity that I'm
[41:44] talking about so the gravity pulls the
[41:47] the river down stream
[41:50] and it's as it's pulling the water
[41:52] Downstream and many times we get tired
[41:55] and we're floating along we've been
[41:57] rolling and sometimes we just let we get
[41:59] complacent
[42:01] I've started drifting before
[42:03] I've just kicked back
[42:05] I've pulled the oars in and you just
[42:08] start drifting along
[42:09] anybody else ever done that
[42:13] I'm just talking to you tonight
[42:15] and I started drifting along but you can
[42:17] be sure that as long as as sure as I'm
[42:20] standing here as you're drifting down
[42:22] that River there's a waterfall down
[42:24] there somewhere there's destruction
[42:25] waiting for you somewhere
[42:29] now the things in our life that we have
[42:32] to overcome there are things that we
[42:34] must do to overcome
[42:36] of course the Lord like I said a minute
[42:38] ago when we do things and we're sorry
[42:40] for it the Lord will always forgive us
[42:43] of it
[42:44] always then don't beat yourself up about
[42:46] it you just get if you get knocked down
[42:49] get right back up again
[42:51] dust yourself off
[42:53] and say I'm still a child of God
[42:56] what he'll do what he loves to do is get
[43:00] you to fall if he can get you to fall
[43:03] if he can get you to to commit a little
[43:06] sin or commit a little mistake
[43:08] especially you men I'm gonna talk to
[43:09] your brothers for just a moment
[43:11] what if he gets you to to look in the
[43:13] wrong direction or maybe you're on your
[43:15] computer and something pops up and all
[43:17] of a sudden your mind goes to a certain
[43:19] thing
[43:20] you don't mean to do that but that's the
[43:22] devil putting that thing in front of you
[43:25] and if you don't immediately immediately
[43:28] right then and there stop and start
[43:30] praying and ask God to help you then
[43:33] that thing might take a hold of you see
[43:36] and a lot of times women maybe somebody
[43:39] said a little something or you get your
[43:41] feelings heard about something or
[43:43] something can happen in the church and
[43:44] maybe somebody said something and it'll
[43:46] cause a little hard feeling
[43:48] right then and there if you don't rebuke
[43:51] that thing and say I forgive him anyway
[43:53] I love them anyway I'm not going to let
[43:55] that come between me and that sister or
[43:58] me and that brother and hinder my walk
[44:00] with Christ
[44:01] because all that stuff hinders the
[44:04] church
[44:06] it does it has an effect on us
[44:10] and and if you've if you've been caught
[44:13] Brothers if the devil sends that thing
[44:16] by your way
[44:17] and the Bible says that that every man
[44:20] um uh is is tempted when he's drawn away
[44:24] of his own lust and now your own lust
[44:27] can draw you away but that's the word
[44:29] you've got to fight that thing
[44:32] brother Donnie was up here and he was
[44:33] talking about David and Goliath and you
[44:36] don't think that's a hard spirit in this
[44:38] last day
[44:39] am I talking to brothers or I'm just
[44:41] talking to the wind here it's a hard
[44:44] spirit in this day it's a wicked spirit
[44:47] it's a spirit of Jezebel in this day
[44:51] you say Jezebel how's it Jezebel look
[44:54] when Jezebel came against Elijah what
[44:58] was it that that was um the spirit that
[45:01] went out against him it was a it was a
[45:04] spirit but she used her her um her sex
[45:08] appeal to to get everybody in in Israel
[45:12] to wonder after those false gods she
[45:15] used her beauty and her influence over
[45:18] her husband Ahab
[45:21] and the very thing that when she came
[45:23] against Elijah
[45:25] and she said I'll have your head by
[45:27] tomorrow
[45:28] he ran at the threat and found himself
[45:31] held up in a cave
[45:34] what was it discouraged Lord they've all
[45:37] left us there's nobody else down there
[45:40] and God said there's seven thousand that
[45:42] hadn't bowed to need a bail but see that
[45:45] was the spirit of discouragement that
[45:47] went out
[45:48] and it anointed it went out and that
[45:50] that was that demon power that even
[45:52] affected the prophet in that day
[45:55] fast forward to John the Baptist
[45:57] he was another Elijah
[45:59] for they said Elias must first come but
[46:02] Jesus said Elias has already come
[46:04] and you did whatever you wanted to to
[46:06] him
[46:07] so when Elijah came again here comes
[46:10] Jezebel again
[46:11] demons don't die they don't die brother
[46:14] random said that's why he didn't believe
[46:16] in the death penalty for two reasons one
[46:19] capital punishment sent Jesus to the
[46:21] cross and two the demon don't die you
[46:25] just free him to get into somebody else
[46:29] I've never understood it conservatives I
[46:31] listen to conservative radio sometimes
[46:33] they're against abortion but yet they're
[46:36] for capital punishment capital murder
[46:39] and then on the other side the
[46:41] left-wingers therefore abortion and
[46:44] against capital punishment
[46:47] I'm against all of it
[46:51] see no man has a right to take another
[46:53] man's life
[46:55] I don't care what nobody says
[46:58] my
[46:59] so here's herodias now with the spirit
[47:03] of Jezebel owner
[47:05] you don't think she did oh yeah yeah
[47:07] life of the king
[47:09] and she what does she do she had a big
[47:12] party set up and she had her daughter to
[47:15] go out there and dance a seductive dance
[47:18] oh you better know it was seductive you
[47:20] better know it was because she got that
[47:22] King so tore up
[47:23] he said I'll give you whatever you want
[47:25] even up to half the kingdom
[47:27] and she ran back to her mommy and said
[47:29] what do I ask for
[47:31] she said the head of John the Baptist
[47:33] now as that Spirit was Warren against
[47:36] John the Baptist
[47:38] do you remember when he was in prison
[47:41] and brother Adam said that his Eagle Eye
[47:43] got filmed over just a little bit he
[47:45] wondered was Jesus really the one
[47:47] is he the one or not actually he was so
[47:51] anointed and the Holy Spirit came down
[47:54] and he said that's the Lamb of God that
[47:57] takes away the sin of the world but yet
[47:59] when he was in prison locked up he
[48:00] wondered what was even the one see that
[48:03] was that Spirit of discouragement that
[48:05] landed on John the Baptist
[48:08] and you and I fast forward another 2 000
[48:11] years we had an Elijah and we're still
[48:14] fighting The Jezebel spirit in this day
[48:19] and he Wars against us in all manner of
[48:22] ways
[48:22] she does he does whatever you want to
[48:24] call it in this day and time it's trans
[48:27] it's a transgender demon I guess
[48:29] Jezebel I don't know what it is
[48:34] Hashem
[48:39] but what does it do what does it do it
[48:42] gets you it gets you into a place to
[48:44] where you'll listen to it for just a
[48:46] minute if you just stop for just a
[48:48] second
[48:49] it's already got you hold on just a
[48:51] minute all right
[48:53] all right
[48:58] don't worry about it I'll just read it
[49:00] can y'all take my word for it
[49:06] [Music]
[49:06] um
[49:08] but see
[49:10] here's the thing
[49:13] brother Donnie was preaching about David
[49:15] and Goliath
[49:16] and we've got a Goliath we've got the
[49:18] spirit of Jezebel that we're fighting in
[49:20] this day
[49:21] and it's it's it's worn against us in
[49:24] the in the spiritual realm and the
[49:26] Physical Realm in the entertainment
[49:28] realm in every realm that you can think
[49:30] of now you we now like we've been
[49:32] preaching brother Caleb's been preaching
[49:35] these different Brothers have been
[49:36] preaching
[49:37] on warfare
[49:39] spiritual warfare Brother JD brother
[49:41] Matt and brother Brad all these brothers
[49:43] have been preaching on knowing your
[49:45] enemy knowing your foe brother Matt
[49:47] Smith knowing your Foe and we've got to
[49:50] understand the enemy that we're fighting
[49:52] against because look
[49:55] yes we can do this okay well I said a
[49:57] minute ago if you sin you go pray and
[49:59] ask God to forgive you sure
[50:01] but there's something you've got to do
[50:03] too
[50:04] because if I'm on a diet
[50:08] all right
[50:10] and I and I'm saying Lord help me to
[50:11] lose weight
[50:13] but every day I go down to McDonald's
[50:14] and I get me a Big Mac
[50:18] and then when I'm done I'm satisfied and
[50:20] I'm full and I'm crying oh Lord
[50:23] I've done it again
[50:25] I'm sorry Lord help me one more time
[50:27] pick me up
[50:29] don't don't let them calories count
[50:30] against Me Lord
[50:32] hauling fat grams and then I had to have
[50:34] the apple pie and all that see
[50:37] the Lord will forgive you for it
[50:41] but until you make them a step in the
[50:44] right direction see
[50:46] you can keep praying and keep praying
[50:48] but there's something you got to do
[50:52] just like when Goliath was standing out
[50:54] there God could have just snapped his
[50:56] finger and his heart would have stopped
[50:57] and then the battle would have been over
[51:00] but that wasn't how he planned it he had
[51:02] a little little four foot nothing Jewish
[51:05] boy
[51:06] come up
[51:08] and say who is this a circumcised
[51:10] philistine
[51:11] two to five the armies of the Living God
[51:13] see he had to do something that Little
[51:16] Rock wasn't going to do nothing that big
[51:17] old giant but whatever he had in his
[51:19] hand God was going to multiply it
[51:22] amen
[51:23] like a Jawbone of a mule with Samson
[51:26] brother Bram said one hit and it would
[51:28] have just shattered to pieces that was a
[51:30] supernatural Jawbone
[51:32] it had a force field around it that just
[51:34] took out a thousand Philistines amen
[51:37] I bet Samson like Bruce Lee out there
[51:40] like a whirlwind it's a dust cloud now I
[51:42] don't know what's going on I'll see arms
[51:44] and legs over here when I'll settle in a
[51:46] thousand of them laying out there
[51:48] how did he do it amen
[51:51] little man from the tribe of Dan
[51:53] Hallelujah little Samson oh my we need
[51:56] to preach on that one of these days
[51:59] but he stood out there see he had to do
[52:01] something he had to make a step
[52:04] and we have to do the same thing
[52:06] you see
[52:08] brother Brandon preached this on making
[52:10] a way he'll make a way for you
[52:12] if you want him to
[52:15] hello
[52:17] God always makes a way of Escape every
[52:19] time sickness pins you in the corner
[52:22] Satan pinned you down to a place after
[52:24] you become a Christian
[52:26] maybe you've been a gambler you see the
[52:29] cards are on the table
[52:30] come on John we know what's in you see
[52:33] when you've been tempted when
[52:35] something's uh maybe you're an alcoholic
[52:37] he says here maybe you're an alcoholic
[52:39] or drunkard
[52:40] see
[52:42] Satan is there to tempt you but God in
[52:44] every time will make a way of Escape if
[52:47] you'll just accept it
[52:49] maybe you've been a drunkard and the
[52:51] glass is under your nose see now come on
[52:54] John now you want to head to that you
[52:56] now you if you if you want to heed to
[52:59] that voice you'll go right straight out
[53:01] to your wallow again see see
[53:05] where
[53:07] oh maybe it's well okay getting close
[53:09] there hey number 86 if you found it
[53:11] there it is yeah number 86 and then on
[53:14] down uh now I'm down to 80 and 89 but
[53:16] God see you're heading right on out to
[53:19] your Waller again oh my
[53:21] God brothers and sisters I ain't gonna
[53:23] stand up here and tell you that I'm
[53:24] holier than thou I'm just one beggar
[53:27] trying to tell another beggar where I
[53:29] found bread tonight
[53:30] because
[53:32] I'm just one bum on the corner trying to
[53:34] tell you where I found some change all
[53:36] right
[53:37] one panhandler to another because that's
[53:40] all we are amen
[53:42] but we've been made more we've made
[53:44] Kings and high priests we don't have to
[53:46] live like that anymore
[53:49] but I fell so many times
[53:51] how could I get up here and tell you
[53:53] about a testimony without a test
[53:55] I've had tests and I fell flat on my
[53:58] face Time and Time and Time and Time
[54:01] Again
[54:03] and I'll do it again I'm sure
[54:06] but I thank God for his grace tonight
[54:11] it's all sufficient Grace
[54:15] look I believe in holiness
[54:17] but I know a lot of times we've been in
[54:20] churches to where they substitute
[54:22] legalism for holiness
[54:26] anybody ever been around something like
[54:28] that
[54:29] Holiness is something that you live
[54:32] it ain't something you impose on
[54:33] somebody else
[54:35] you see that's when it becomes legalism
[54:39] what did you see did you see what she
[54:41] had on
[54:42] my goodness
[54:44] do you see what he you see his hair how
[54:46] long it was did you my good you know
[54:49] what I'm saying
[54:50] how about we clean up our own back door
[54:52] I guarantee you if you me and everybody
[54:55] else spend as much time worrying about
[54:58] us and him we wouldn't have time to see
[55:01] everybody else
[55:04] um
[55:07] that's what I want
[55:10] we need to get that love amongst us
[55:13] obey the word
[55:15] push play and obey
[55:18] we need to listen to those tapes we need
[55:20] to hear that voice say man you need to
[55:22] know what the prophet said we don't need
[55:24] to be carried or carried about by every
[55:26] win of Doctrine
[55:28] we grew up many times me and my wife
[55:30] were talking about this
[55:31] maybe many of you haven't I'm just
[55:33] talking from my experience of being
[55:35] around a certain Doctrine and when you
[55:38] go to church you're listening for that
[55:39] Doctrine good or bad you're listening if
[55:42] they gonna say something bad about them
[55:43] I ain't going back over there
[55:45] and if you listen if they say something
[55:47] well hey he's right down my alley right
[55:50] instead of listening to what maybe the
[55:52] holy spirit's saying to you you're just
[55:54] listening to see if they're going to
[55:55] preach on your pet Doctrine or not
[55:59] yeah
[56:00] well I'ma tell you right now I've got a
[56:02] Doctrine and that's Jesus Christ
[56:04] no law but love no Creed but Christ and
[56:07] no book but the Bible
[56:09] and we believe this message I believe it
[56:12] is absolutely a perfect message it don't
[56:15] I don't mean my scrutiny it's already
[56:17] been Vindicated by uh absolute Old
[56:21] Testament class prophet
[56:24] of the caliber of Moses of the caliber
[56:27] of Elijah
[56:28] they don't need my little uh blog spot
[56:31] on the Facebook or the internet giving
[56:34] my two cents about it but I'm going to
[56:36] tell you right now if I don't never
[56:37] preach again I'm going to tell you that
[56:40] if it's my last message I want my last
[56:42] message to say this is a perfect message
[56:48] I don't care who says what
[56:52] now if you want to go out and sin and
[56:55] the devil's gravity is pulling all of us
[56:57] all right
[57:00] many times some of us want to go on out
[57:02] there but we want to try to find a fault
[57:05] in this message to excuse it to ease our
[57:09] conscience about leaving church
[57:13] well they may he made a mistake
[57:16] or that really that cloud wasn't really
[57:18] taken out there or whatever kind of
[57:20] nonsense hogwash that they've come up
[57:22] with
[57:24] but I don't need scientific proof to
[57:27] believe the Red Sea parted
[57:30] I don't need scientific proof to know
[57:32] the pillar of fire came down on Mount
[57:34] Sinai and the whole mountain rumbled and
[57:37] it was on a smoke and the people cried
[57:39] and trembled and said oh don't let God
[57:42] speak to us no more but Moses you speak
[57:44] to us
[57:45] I don't need scientific proof to know
[57:48] that water came from a rock
[57:50] this is my proof right here I believe
[57:52] God's word
[57:54] that's enough for me
[57:57] since when did the people of God rely on
[58:01] government documents and scientific
[58:04] proof
[58:07] we need to believe his word
[58:10] and get it out of your mind if you're
[58:12] not convinced that he was the seventh
[58:15] Church AIDS messenger I don't know what
[58:17] else it'll take to convince you
[58:20] he was the messenger for this day he was
[58:23] absolutely thoroughly completely
[58:26] Vindicated
[58:27] Beyond any doubt
[58:30] Beyond any scrutiny
[58:32] as brother JD said there was no
[58:35] absolutely no
[58:38] um question of whether or not the
[58:41] supernatural was taking place in the
[58:43] meetings
[58:44] the question was when the Pharisees saw
[58:47] it they said it was of the devil
[58:50] and there were plenty Pharisees there
[58:54] but when the true bride saw it they said
[58:57] that's nothing but Jesus Christ
[59:00] we say the same thing tonight
[59:02] this message is a supernatural message
[59:05] oh it's so Supernatural
[59:08] the whole nation of Israel was
[59:09] Supernatural they came from a dead man
[59:12] basically
[59:13] he was as good as dead 100 years old
[59:16] reproductive organs gone
[59:20] wife couldn't nurse if she wanted to
[59:23] miraculous
[59:25] Israel
[59:27] so was his message we were listening to
[59:30] it with my daughter a couple years ago
[59:33] we listened to how the angel came to me
[59:35] oh my brother just went all over me I
[59:39] was sitting there listening to How
[59:39] brother Bram said he was there and he
[59:41] was just he said how foolish could it
[59:43] somebody be he was praying for God to
[59:45] take that thing away from those chances
[59:47] those visions and he said he was in that
[59:49] cabin there in that hunting cabin and he
[59:51] said a little light showed and he saw a
[59:53] man he heard footsteps way out in the
[59:55] dark in the woods that'd scare me to
[59:57] death wouldn't scare you
[1:00:00] scared him and he heard footsteps come
[1:00:04] walking up
[1:00:05] and he saw a barefoot in that light
[1:00:08] he looked up and he saw a man about six
[1:00:10] foot tall all of complexion
[1:00:14] brother Billy Paul said when he saw him
[1:00:15] he said if you could look if you could
[1:00:18] if if they were of a race they looked
[1:00:21] like the Armenian people is what he said
[1:00:23] Armenian kind of in between Middle
[1:00:26] Eastern and
[1:00:27] kind of like that
[1:00:29] oh my these words that he told him
[1:00:31] could you and I could just hear it
[1:00:33] brother I could hear it when he said it
[1:00:35] the angel said fear not
[1:00:38] for I'm sent from the presence
[1:00:40] of almighty God oh my
[1:00:48] what you need
[1:00:50] brother rap said Moses you showed that
[1:00:52] sign one time and they never had to do
[1:00:53] it again
[1:00:54] but brother Branham had to do it again
[1:00:56] and again and again and again and again
[1:01:00] still they didn't believe but more
[1:01:02] blessed are them that have not seen
[1:01:05] and believe amen I believe you believe
[1:01:09] tonight oh my
[1:01:11] God I believe it
[1:01:14] Hallelujah
[1:01:15] now
[1:01:18] so the church is going to have trouble
[1:01:20] we have hard feelings unforgiveness and
[1:01:24] all these things that's the gravity of
[1:01:25] the devil
[1:01:27] I already said about the all right so
[1:01:29] here's the weapon I wrote down had
[1:01:31] enough time to write down a few notes
[1:01:32] brother Matt
[1:01:35] but brother Donnie said this and this
[1:01:37] got me he said
[1:01:39] he said that when when he's knocked down
[1:01:42] Goliath with that stone
[1:01:44] brother Branham said it flew A Thousand
[1:01:46] Miles a second
[1:01:48] that's fast
[1:01:50] I did the math on it
[1:01:52] it comes up to Mach 4000. you know what
[1:01:55] that is mocks of Speed and Sound
[1:01:58] 4 000 times the speed of sound
[1:02:01] three million six hundred thousand miles
[1:02:04] an hour
[1:02:06] that's what it comes up to
[1:02:09] hey John didn't have a chance
[1:02:12] I don't care how little David was
[1:02:16] little as much when God is in it oh my
[1:02:19] you believe that little is much when God
[1:02:22] is in it
[1:02:23] but he said that he jumped up on that
[1:02:25] giant and he took the sword that he
[1:02:27] intended to slay David with
[1:02:28] the very weapon that he was going to
[1:02:30] kill him David took it out of his sheath
[1:02:32] and chopped that devil Giant's head off
[1:02:36] how many of he's got a Goliath in your
[1:02:39] life
[1:02:40] maybe a sickness maybe a besetting sin
[1:02:43] maybe a little something is a Glide
[1:02:45] there's a mountain that's always there
[1:02:47] but let me tell you something he said
[1:02:50] take the very weapon now here's the
[1:02:52] weapon the devil really don't have a
[1:02:53] weapon you've got a weapon you've got
[1:02:56] faith there ain't no greater weapon than
[1:02:58] that see you've got faith and you've got
[1:03:00] the word of God okay now here's what
[1:03:03] happens how do you take the Devil's
[1:03:06] weapon and use it against him now
[1:03:08] talking about this in the men's prayer
[1:03:09] meeting so they got to jump on you
[1:03:11] but at cage I was going down the road I
[1:03:13] said Lord how can I take the Devil's
[1:03:15] weapon how can I take his weapon how can
[1:03:17] I take the weapon how can I and I got to
[1:03:19] think of what is this Weapon It's doubt
[1:03:21] it's unbelief his weapon is to get you
[1:03:23] to doubt your weapon that's all his
[1:03:25] weapon is is to get you to discredit
[1:03:28] what you've got it's to get you to
[1:03:30] discredit and how does he do that
[1:03:32] through a thought the greatest battle
[1:03:34] ever fought was in the mind it began in
[1:03:36] the mind so wait a minute I'm not going
[1:03:38] to wait until I've already got you know
[1:03:40] I'm down on my back no you
[1:03:42] ounce of prevention is worth a pound of
[1:03:43] cure we just read that with the kids
[1:03:45] last night Jesus was talking about that
[1:03:49] see he said if you're walking with
[1:03:50] somebody try to make peace with him then
[1:03:52] he said or not they're going to throw
[1:03:54] you in jail take you to the judge then
[1:03:55] the officer is going to deliver you so
[1:03:57] he's like then you're gonna pay
[1:03:58] everything to get out so my kids like
[1:04:00] what does that mean daddy he's like
[1:04:01] don't make a mountain out of a molehill
[1:04:03] and take care of things while they're
[1:04:05] little
[1:04:06] before it gets out of hand and it gets
[1:04:08] too big to deal with
[1:04:10] now that might not be your
[1:04:11] interpretation that was mine
[1:04:14] and the kids enjoyed it so I said well
[1:04:16] praise God they learned something
[1:04:19] but see don't let the little things get
[1:04:21] big things
[1:04:23] when a little thought comes in your mind
[1:04:26] what do you do you maybe you start
[1:04:28] entertaining it you start thinking about
[1:04:29] things and all of a sudden before you
[1:04:31] know he doesn't zone out going out oh no
[1:04:34] here's how you take his weapon me and
[1:04:37] the devil's prayer Partners now and he
[1:04:39] don't even know it I bet he's fuming mad
[1:04:41] screw loose or or peg leg or whatever
[1:04:44] his name is his Downer he's probably
[1:04:45] getting he's probably getting the third
[1:04:47] degree from the devil because he doesn't
[1:04:49] turn something loose inside of me
[1:04:51] because now every time he sends a
[1:04:54] thought my way it's my time to pray
[1:04:58] that's my weapon
[1:04:59] that's my I say thank you devil for
[1:05:01] reminding me to pray today thank you
[1:05:04] devil for reminding me to go to God
[1:05:06] thank you devil
[1:05:09] oh my let me tell you take that weapon
[1:05:12] he's trying to use against you and turn
[1:05:14] it right back around on him
[1:05:17] um
[1:05:18] stop that thing before it gets starts
[1:05:21] taking root
[1:05:23] because if it if it gets implanted you
[1:05:26] know it'll start growing
[1:05:28] and you got a lot of problems then it
[1:05:30] gets real big and then you got more
[1:05:31] problems
[1:05:33] just cut it off
[1:05:34] stop that thing
[1:05:36] now don't that sound easy
[1:05:38] Brothers it is easy
[1:05:41] and you got a good prayer life to boot
[1:05:45] and the devil's just over scratching his
[1:05:47] head but what do I do with him now
[1:05:49] I want to get to a place where the devil
[1:05:51] don't know what to do with me
[1:05:53] [Applause]
[1:05:55] that's where I want to be
[1:05:57] I want to get so deep in the Holy Ghost
[1:05:59] he can't even find me
[1:06:02] oh my I want this whole church to get so
[1:06:05] deep and the Holy Ghost the devil he'll
[1:06:07] be looking I've looked here I don't know
[1:06:10] where he's at Lucifer where I don't know
[1:06:11] where he's at either I don't know he's a
[1:06:13] he's hit he's hiding he's hiding in the
[1:06:16] cleft of the rock that's where he's at
[1:06:18] that dog on how to Shell that Matt
[1:06:20] Watkins he found the cleft in that rock
[1:06:22] I tried to keep him away from it but he
[1:06:25] found it anyway
[1:06:26] glory be to God hallelujah tonight oh
[1:06:30] wow
[1:06:32] find that cleft in the rock
[1:06:34] Hallelujah
[1:06:38] take that weapon and use it against the
[1:06:40] devil this is what brother Branham said
[1:06:42] here oh my
[1:06:44] he said now if you want to heed to that
[1:06:46] voice you'll go right straight out to
[1:06:48] the wallow again bring it back up there
[1:06:50] if you can brother
[1:06:51] 89 but God is always there do this
[1:06:56] turn your mind towards heaven
[1:07:00] this now he's talking about when he
[1:07:01] comes in when the trip when The
[1:07:03] Temptations come when the Trials come
[1:07:05] when the lust comes when the temptation
[1:07:07] to drink the temptation to get upset the
[1:07:10] temptation to get depressed the
[1:07:11] temptation to think that you're
[1:07:13] worthless the temptation to think that
[1:07:15] you're not pretty or that you got low
[1:07:17] self-esteem and nobody likes you and all
[1:07:19] these temptations that the devil is
[1:07:20] going to bring against you
[1:07:23] talking to somebody in here tonight
[1:07:25] just turn your mind towards heaven
[1:07:28] and look towards Calvary that this is
[1:07:31] what the prophet said Do you believe him
[1:07:33] say blessed Holy Spirit
[1:07:36] come to me I'm in need and he said watch
[1:07:39] what takes place God Will Make A Way of
[1:07:42] Escape every time for he will God will
[1:07:46] always do it or you always did it he'll
[1:07:49] do it but we've got to run to him
[1:07:53] we've got to run back to him just as
[1:07:56] hard as we can go
[1:07:57] oh my
[1:07:59] you believe it try not to hold you I
[1:08:02] gotta one more here
[1:08:04] now we want to talk about just a moment
[1:08:07] about that gravity of that Force John 12
[1:08:11] and 32 turned there for just a second
[1:08:14] and I want to read you might some of you
[1:08:16] may know it already
[1:08:19] John 12 and 32
[1:08:22] and we'll see what Jesus said
[1:08:29] y'all forgive me for getting too tore up
[1:08:33] please forgive me
[1:08:35] come on I just thought about
[1:08:37] unforgiveness brother
[1:08:41] oh my
[1:08:44] Sister Sarah up here that Sunday I told
[1:08:47] her I said I didn't have enough room for
[1:08:48] you to sing up here sister
[1:08:51] she was but bouncing up against them
[1:08:54] drum sets in the microphones and
[1:08:56] everything else I said Hallelujah Lord
[1:08:58] part let it pour on all of us like that
[1:09:01] I will tell you right now if you shout
[1:09:03] and you scream and you holler you don't
[1:09:05] make me nervous one bit
[1:09:07] not a
[1:09:09] oh no what makes me nervous is when you
[1:09:11] don't say nothing sitting there looking
[1:09:12] at me
[1:09:15] like brother Brown said a frog eating
[1:09:16] Buckshot or something
[1:09:19] well if it makes you mad at least it's
[1:09:21] making you think
[1:09:23] because I'm gonna tell you right now
[1:09:25] some of the greatest Revelations I've
[1:09:26] ever had it was after I got mad about it
[1:09:28] because you know what it upset my little
[1:09:30] apple car it upset my way of thinking I
[1:09:33] had it all figured out um
[1:09:34] I'll stay on the brother the other day I
[1:09:36] said about 20 years ago the distance
[1:09:39] between what I knew and what I thought I
[1:09:41] knew was about like from here to L.A
[1:09:43] that was a big difference
[1:09:46] but I'm glad that God's merciful
[1:09:49] and he's patient
[1:09:52] he's patient
[1:09:55] oh my
[1:09:56] God and Jesus said talk about gravity
[1:09:58] and if I be lifted up from the earth
[1:10:00] we'll draw all men unto me oh my gravity
[1:10:06] what is that that's a mass grader
[1:10:09] now see what's greater in your life
[1:10:13] are the pleasures of the world
[1:10:15] are the sins of the world is that what
[1:10:18] you really hunger for that ain't what
[1:10:19] you hunger for in here tonight is that
[1:10:21] what you really want is that the
[1:10:22] greatest thing that's going to draw you
[1:10:25] that way
[1:10:25] if you want a good time you want the
[1:10:28] party you want the lies that the devil
[1:10:30] tells you see he'll show you the
[1:10:31] Budweiser commercials and then I'm up
[1:10:33] there just getting down and having fun
[1:10:35] but he don't show you the cirrhosis of
[1:10:36] the liver he don't show you the date
[1:10:38] rape he don't show you the car crash
[1:10:40] into the tree see he shows you all the
[1:10:42] good times he shows you all these good
[1:10:44] things but he don't show you the outcome
[1:10:47] of going down that road
[1:10:52] oh yeah it feels good to get to get a
[1:10:54] little high
[1:10:55] I want to get a little high in here
[1:10:56] tonight too
[1:10:58] but I don't need no fermented yeast malt
[1:11:01] barley grapes or nothing else
[1:11:05] how old the new wine
[1:11:08] I was the Holy Spirit Wine
[1:11:11] um
[1:11:13] man we need some new bottles in here too
[1:11:15] don't we
[1:11:17] new wine and new bottles will be all
[1:11:18] right
[1:11:20] it ain't drunk as you suppose but this
[1:11:23] is that
[1:11:24] that was prophesied by Joel
[1:11:27] hey man this is that
[1:11:29] said I'll be lifted up I'll draw a man
[1:11:32] unto me this is what brother bran said
[1:11:34] he said but let's watch I'm gonna close
[1:11:36] here in just a few minutes but let's
[1:11:37] watch him as he stands there this is
[1:11:39] Jesus talk about gravitation now
[1:11:42] gravitational pull
[1:11:44] oh my I want that gravitational pull to
[1:11:47] go in a different direction
[1:11:49] you know they say the magnetic field
[1:11:51] changed in the earth it actually has a
[1:11:53] scientific proof it used to go sideways
[1:11:55] now it goes up and down they've proven
[1:11:57] it
[1:11:58] I could go into all the details but I
[1:12:01] don't want to bore you
[1:12:03] but gravitation loses its power see now
[1:12:07] watch
[1:12:08] as this is after he rose from the dead
[1:12:11] he appeared to the disciples
[1:12:14] he was seen right here of about 500
[1:12:17] people at this moment they had it going
[1:12:19] away Gathering 500 people saw him
[1:12:23] he said there's a light beneath his feet
[1:12:25] he starts seeing daylight between his
[1:12:27] feet and the ground he rises higher and
[1:12:29] higher higher and higher gravitation
[1:12:32] lost its power just as death lost its
[1:12:35] power he was the center of gravitation
[1:12:39] oh my God
[1:12:41] he was the creator of gravitation he
[1:12:45] held gravitation at his own command as
[1:12:48] he held death at his own command let me
[1:12:51] tell you something brothers and sisters
[1:12:52] we've got to overcome the world in here
[1:12:54] before we can overcome the world out
[1:12:56] here we've got to overcome the Enemy
[1:12:58] Within before we can ever face the enemy
[1:13:01] out there we've gotten to fight we've
[1:13:03] got to we've got to press on we've got
[1:13:06] to press on we've got to overcome it's
[1:13:08] not a maybe it's not a hope so we must
[1:13:11] overcome in this day
[1:13:13] don't give up
[1:13:15] because there's a there's a gravity
[1:13:17] force that I'm pointing to now see I was
[1:13:20] pulled the other way but I was getting
[1:13:22] pulled down that waterfall it was a

[1:13:31] skin starts sagging pretty soon it pulls
[1:13:33] you right on down into the grave into
[1:13:35] the ground and then if you're you don't
[1:13:38] have anything that's anti-gravity
[1:13:39] anti-satian gravity see I believe in
[1:13:42] gravity but if you don't have anything
[1:13:44] that's anti then you're gonna keep going
[1:13:46] down
[1:13:46] and down and brother random he got shot

[1:35:09] Lord we just pray that Lord I stood at a
[1:35:13] deathbed of a woman and she had done
[1:35:15] gone beyond her speech and I asked her I
[1:35:18] said to you accept the Lord Jesus and
[1:35:21] Lord you know that she's I said if you
[1:35:23] if you do just blink your eyes all she
[1:35:26] could do Lord was blink her eyes and God
[1:35:28] I believe that by that confession Lord
[1:35:31] and by that faith in you dear God that
[1:35:34] I'll see her again one day and Lord we
[1:35:36] just pray the same thing and God you
[1:35:38] have all these needs and all these
[1:35:40] requests before you Lord and we just lay
[1:35:43] them knowing that you'll see to it for
[1:35:45] you are Jehovah Jireh Lord we love you
[1:35:48] and we thank you we commit this service
[1:35:50] into thy hands Lord in Jesus name amen
[1:35:56] amen we still got a little bit of times
[1:35:58] anybody gotta testimony
[1:36:01] all right
[1:36:08] I just want to give a praise um
[1:36:11] the Lord put upon my wife's heart
[1:36:13] several weeks ago to pray for a prayer
[1:36:17] cloth over my brother-in-law Ray
[1:36:19] Reddington and she didn't really even
[1:36:21] know why but she did and she took it
[1:36:24] home and then she struggled over what to
[1:36:26] write in the card and she she finally
[1:36:29] sent it while unbeknownst to us he ended
[1:36:32] up in the hospital and um
[1:36:35] I called my sister and I said hey
[1:36:38] there's something in the mailbox for Ray
[1:36:41] I'm getting ready to go to the hospital
[1:36:43] I said would you please go get it before
[1:36:45] you go to the hospital
[1:36:47] and so she went outside and got it and
[1:36:50] it brought tears to his eyes when he
[1:36:51] read the card and he saw the prayer
[1:36:53] cloth and he knew the scripture and
[1:36:57] about a week later he had to go get a
[1:36:59] heart ablation and if they would have
[1:37:02] given him that heart ablation
[1:37:04] he would have died he had stenosis in
[1:37:08] the heart they did a test and they told
[1:37:10] him guaranteed there's no way you would
[1:37:12] have made it through this and so he made
[1:37:15] the doctor let him stay in the hospital
[1:37:17] and four days later he got a new valve
[1:37:20] replacement and he's already back home
[1:37:22] so God is good he cares and I'm just so
[1:37:26] thankful for it
[1:37:33] and then I got a I got another parade
[1:37:35] report uh we've been we had another
[1:37:37] doctor's appointment yesterday and it
[1:37:41] you know their doctors are just so
[1:37:43] uncertain
[1:37:44] but the next doctor's appointment we
[1:37:47] have is about a month from today and I
[1:37:51] am certain that that it's a work that's
[1:37:53] already been done and we we actually got
[1:37:55] better news than we've been getting
[1:37:57] yesterday and so I'm thankful for that
[1:37:59] report in one month that it's already
[1:38:01] done
[1:38:04] foreign
[1:38:10] a couple of weeks ago I was helping
[1:38:12] sister Brenda with a project at her
[1:38:13] house
[1:38:14] we were trying to unfold a table and
[1:38:17] pull the table leg out and the table
[1:38:19] legs were meant to extend as far as you
[1:38:21] needed them extend or go in as far as
[1:38:22] you needed them go in Table leg got
[1:38:25] stuck and I was pulling and pulling on
[1:38:26] it it wouldn't come loose and I thought
[1:38:28] well I'm gonna get this out so I yanked
[1:38:30] on it as hard as I could and when I did
[1:38:31] it popped completely out popped me in my
[1:38:34] left eye I mean hard when I tell you I
[1:38:36] was in pain I couldn't even hardly
[1:38:39] breathe it hurt so bad
[1:38:41] sister Brenda immediately grabbed me and
[1:38:44] she started praying and I knew when she
[1:38:47] started praying I was like that's not
[1:38:49] her praying that's God
[1:38:51] and
[1:38:53] we went in the living room and she gave
[1:38:54] me an ice pack Pride come to the house
[1:38:56] and he prayed
[1:38:58] and when I first opened my eye I could
[1:39:01] not see anything out of the left side of
[1:39:04] my left eye it was totally black
[1:39:06] and the middle the right side of my eye
[1:39:09] it looked like when you're a little kid
[1:39:10] you're playing like your cross side it
[1:39:12] looked like that it was just I couldn't
[1:39:14] see nothing out of my eye
[1:39:16] and we kept praying and praying kept
[1:39:20] that ice pack on there and when Brad
[1:39:22] came and prayed and he left to go get me
[1:39:24] a little eye patch to put on it because
[1:39:26] the light was hurting my eyes so bad but
[1:39:28] within about 20 minutes the Blackness
[1:39:31] went away on the one side of my eye but
[1:39:33] it was still very blurry and I couldn't
[1:39:35] still see very well but within a couple
[1:39:38] of hours the the I started dilating like
[1:39:42] it was supposed to all the blurriness
[1:39:44] pretty much went away by that night I
[1:39:46] went to bed got up the next morning
[1:39:48] there was barely a bruise on my eye it
[1:39:51] was barely puffy at all and I had a
[1:39:54] small little red spot in the bottom of
[1:39:55] it and by the end of the week it was
[1:39:59] pretty much everything was gone it was
[1:40:01] like nothing had ever even happened and
[1:40:02] I know that was a miracle
[1:40:07] okay
[1:40:12] all right go ahead bro
[1:40:17] and Matt was like we gotta go home it's
[1:40:19] no time enough I about jumped up was
[1:40:21] like hey hey wait a minute but I figured
[1:40:24] I better behave but uh the other night
[1:40:28] um
[1:40:30] Meredith was looking at Hazel and she
[1:40:34] opened her mouth and
[1:40:36] um
[1:40:38] Meredith's like wait what was that on
[1:40:39] her tooth and she looked she's like here
[1:40:42] get a light and so we got a light and we
[1:40:44] looked at it and there was behind one of
[1:40:46] her front teeth it was all black we
[1:40:48] thought well
[1:40:49] what is that is that a cavity or is that
[1:40:51] something on her tooth and she brushed
[1:40:53] her tooth and it was still black
[1:40:55] and we were like so she must have a
[1:40:58] cavity on her front tooth there you know
[1:41:02] and uh of course Meredith is in the
[1:41:05] medical field and she looks it up you
[1:41:07] know she's looking at it and she's like
[1:41:09] you know that could ruin her smile you
[1:41:12] know they'd have to work on that tooth
[1:41:13] it could mess up her teeth and ruin her
[1:41:17] smile and you know all that fear just
[1:41:19] starts what if
[1:41:21] and you know what if and
[1:41:25] I I was sitting there and you could just
[1:41:27] feel that just coming down oh my what
[1:41:30] are we gonna do we're gonna make an
[1:41:32] appointment and something just came over
[1:41:34] me and I said
[1:41:35] no sir I said Satan you're a liar shut
[1:41:39] up I was like we're not accepting that
[1:41:42] she's not gonna have that where she's
[1:41:45] well from now on WE that's what we're
[1:41:47] gonna testify is like if you gotta take
[1:41:49] her to the appointment fine whatever but
[1:41:52] we're not accepting that
[1:41:54] couple days later guess what it's gone
[1:41:56] praise the Lord
[1:41:58] [Applause]
[1:42:06] it's a little bit different I know we've
[1:42:07] already prayed and we've and we've
[1:42:09] prayed for brother Jason I'm sorry
[1:42:12] okay you got one I just want to say this
[1:42:14] before I give this to you so I want to I
[1:42:16] want to say this let's all say together
[1:42:19] thank you Lord because it's already done
[1:42:21] thank you Lord for healing brother Jason
[1:42:24] let's say so I'll say it together thank
[1:42:26] you Lord for healing brother Jason and
[1:42:29] now let's give him thanks for healing
[1:42:31] the baby of brother Caleb's sister Joy
[1:42:34] thank you Lord because it's already done
[1:42:37] it's a done deal we've already prayed
[1:42:38] we've given to him
[1:42:40] it's all it's already done amen
[1:42:47] so that night that we had gathered
[1:42:50] around and people the Lord was laying it
[1:42:52] upon people's hearts to have prayer
[1:42:53] cloths prayed over the Lord unction my
[1:42:55] heart
[1:42:56] to have a prayer cloth for my son
[1:42:59] and I got that sent in the mail to him
[1:43:02] and I didn't tell him nothing I waited I
[1:43:05] just wrote him a handwritten letter
[1:43:07] to tell him how that the Lord brought
[1:43:09] that about so he would understand that
[1:43:12] this was something that the Lord is
[1:43:14] giving him
[1:43:15] and I um and so anyway he read it and
[1:43:20] after that he called me
[1:43:23] several hours later
[1:43:25] and he said Mom I got that prayer cloth
[1:43:29] he said when I put that in my pocket he
[1:43:31] slid I slipped it down into my pocket
[1:43:33] and he said I felt the Holy Spirit I
[1:43:36] just thought I felt the Lord just move
[1:43:37] through my entire body
[1:43:41] and I was just like so excited because I
[1:43:44] knew that the Lord had spoke to me and
[1:43:46] you know it was that something that I
[1:43:48] had to go and get that and to think that
[1:43:51] I if I had ever pushed that down just
[1:43:54] because you hate walking in front of
[1:43:55] people at least I do
[1:43:58] and
[1:43:59] that was the gift for him and he had not
[1:44:03] been able to get any
[1:44:04] time with his daughter
[1:44:07] and he's been struggling with that he
[1:44:08] wants his time with his daughter so bad
[1:44:11] and she had been the mother had been
[1:44:14] unwilling to do anything for him like to
[1:44:16] give him anything hardly at all and that
[1:44:19] very day a couple of hours later after
[1:44:21] he got the prayer cloth he got a phone
[1:44:24] call he got the mother started
[1:44:26] negotiating
[1:44:28] so now he's not only got
[1:44:30] more days added to when he gets to spend
[1:44:33] time with his daughter he has overnights
[1:44:35] with her she spends the night two nights
[1:44:37] in a row he's just getting more and more
[1:44:40] and it's just been amazing and he told
[1:44:42] me he said Mom this happened after I got
[1:44:46] the prayer cloth so he was already given
[1:44:49] God the thanks and the you know
[1:44:52] the reason for all this even happening
[1:44:55] he was testifying to the fact that it
[1:44:57] this is working and so I was so excited
[1:45:00] and I know that personally I gotta say
[1:45:04] this I believe that God has way more in
[1:45:07] store for him than just that that was
[1:45:10] just the beginning
[1:45:12] yeah
[1:45:14] [Applause]
