[43:36] pudimos venir acá
[43:38] también entonces es un placer y un
[43:41] privilegio estar con
[43:44] ustedes podría decir muchas cosas acerca
[43:46] de
[43:48] Honduras pero es mejor que ustedes vayan
[43:50] allá
[43:55] [Música]
[43:57] que vamos a ir a la
[44:00] escritura Agradezco al hermano Jason la
[44:05] oportunidad de poder hablarles a
[44:09] ustedes yo sé que han tenido muy buenos
[44:11] predicadores
[44:14] acá pero yo creo que la novia también se
[44:16] goza con las cosas
[44:21] pequeñas Así que si esta mañana son
[44:23] cosas pequeñas
[44:28] le vamos a decir
[44:31] amén y si son cosas
[44:33] grandes
[44:37] tambén vamos al libro de los
[44:40] romanos en el capítulo
[44:43] 12 en el verso
[44:46] un queremos hablar un poquito esta
[44:50] mañana acerca del Dios que sobrepasa la
[44:53] materia
[44:59] una vez que lleguen por ahí pueden
[45:00] indicarlo con un
[45:06] Amén la palabra del señor
[45:10] dice así que hermanos os ruego por las
[45:13] misericordias de Dios que presentéis
[45:15] vuestros cuerpos en sacrificio vivo
[45:17] Santo agradable a Dios que es vuestro
[45:20] culto racional
[45:32] no os conforméis a este siglo sino
[45:34] transformaos por medio de la renovación
[45:37] de vuestro entendimiento para que
[45:39] comprobéis cuál sea la buena voluntad de
[45:42] Dios agradable y
[45:53] perfecta digo pues por la gracia que me
[45:56] es dada a cada cual que está entre
[45:58] vosotros que no tenga más alto concepto
[46:00] de sí que el que debe tener sino que
[46:02] piense de Sí con cordura conforme a la
[46:05] medida de fe que Dios repartió a cada
[46:20] uno una escritura conocida en segunda de
[46:23] Corintios
[46:24] [Música]
[46:29] en el capítulo 4 verso
[46:42] 15 lo
[46:45] tienen porque todas estas cosas
[46:48] padecemos por amor a vosotros para que
[46:50] abundando la gracia por medio de muchos
[46:53] la Acción de Gracias sobreabunde para
[46:55] gloria de Dios
[47:06] por tanto no desmayamos Antes aunque
[47:09] este nuestro hombre exterior se va
[47:12] desgastando el interior no obstante se
[47:15] renueva de día en día
[47:27] porque esta leve tribulación momentánea
[47:29] produce en nosotros un cada vez más
[47:32] excelente y eterno peso de
[47:40] [Música]
[47:41] Gloria No mirando nosotros las cosas que
[47:44] se ven sino las que no se ven pues las
[47:48] cosas que se ven son temporales pero las
[47:50] que no se ven son eternas
[48:04] porque sabemos que si es si nuestra
[48:06] morada terrestre este tabernáculo se
[48:09] deshiciere tenemos de Dios un edificio
[48:12] una casa no hecha de manos eterna en los
[48:16] cielos el verso 51
[48:35] inclin nuestro rostros padre
[48:38] celestial Gracias te damos esta
[48:41] mañana Señor por la oportunidad de estar
[48:44] frente a tu
[48:46] pueblo un domingo de
[48:50] resurrección un domingo de
[48:52] victoria un domingo cuando tú te
[48:54] levantaste de entre los muertos
[48:57] y diste esa
[48:59] promesa por cuanto yo vivo vosotros
[49:02] también
[49:03] viviréis Señor gracias esta
[49:06] mañana te pedimos que inspires nuestros
[49:11] labios nuestros
[49:13] pensamientos y también los corazones que
[49:15] recibirán tu
[49:17] palabra Señor gracias por
[49:20] todo encomendamos el servicio en tus
[49:24] manos para honra y gloria tuya
[49:27] [Música]
[49:29] am tomen
[49:31] asiento también reciban saludos de mi
[49:35] esposa había olvidado decirles
[49:42] eso entendemos que estamos en el tiempo
[49:44] del
[49:48] fin Las edades Las edades están
[49:52] concluyendo las edades han terminado
[49:58] la puerta de los gentiles se está ahora
[50:01] mismo
[50:05] cerrando y Dios está preparando un
[50:07] pueblo para poder llevárselo a
[50:11] casa llevárselo en un rapto
[50:14] glorioso Y eso es lo que nosotros
[50:16] estamos
[50:18] esperando el profeta dijo que las
[50:20] profecías se han
[50:25] cumplido y la única cosa que queda la
[50:28] única cosa que
[50:29] resta y que nosotros estamos esperando
[50:33] es el rapto de la
[50:34] iglesia porque sabemos que el mundo se
[50:37] está preparando para un
[50:40] evento de este lado podemos ver al mundo
[50:43] preparándose para lo que viene para
[50:49] ellos pero en el otro lado podemos ver
[50:52] un pueblo también preparándose para lo
[50:54] que viene a recibirlo a ellos
[50:59] el mundo se está preparando para un
[51:01] tiempo de
[51:04] angustia el mundo se está preparando
[51:06] para ese evento llamado la gran
[51:12] tribulación todo está preparándose todos
[51:15] ellos están preparándose para
[51:18] eso su su vista Solamente les permite
[51:21] ver la gran
[51:23] tribulación Ellos no saben lo que está
[51:26] pasando
[51:28] Ellos no saben lo que viene hacia
[51:30] ellos pero hablemos un poco del grupo
[51:32] que está al otro
[51:35] lado esos son
[51:37] ustedes nosotros no estamos esperando
[51:39] gran
[51:41] tribulación porque el profeta dice antes
[51:43] que las plagas vengan Nos iremos a
[51:48] casa el profeta dijo antes que las
[51:50] bombas azoten la tierra Nos iremos a
[51:52] casa
[51:56] todo esto se está
[51:58] terminando Las edades están
[52:01] acabando Dios ha enviado su
[52:03] mensaje Dios enviado su
[52:05] profeta Dios nos envió el profeta que
[52:08] necesitábamos para este de la
[52:11] iglesia yo no espero un profeta
[52:14] más estoy esperando un octavo Ángel
[52:19] mensajero estamos esperando la venida de
[52:21] nuestro señor
[52:25] Jesucristo
[52:27] avivami más grande que el avivamiento
[52:31] Pentecostal un Avivamiento que va a
[52:33] cambiar mi
[52:35] cuerpo un Avivamiento que va a cambiar
[52:38] mis
[52:40] canas un Avivamiento que va a levantar a
[52:42] los muertos de la
[52:44] tumba un aviamiento para la novia del
[52:49] cordero y eso es para
[52:52] usted y eso es para m eso es lo que esto
[52:58] solamente vea lo que hay en el
[53:00] mundo es triste ver la imagen que hay en
[53:02] el
[53:04] mundo están en
[53:07] esclavitud dice el profeta No hay cosa
[53:09] más triste que ver a alguien que es
[53:15] esclavo él no hace lo que él quiere
[53:19] hacer él él hace lo que su dueño le dice
[53:23] que le haga
[53:26] eso es lo que es el
[53:28] mundo Ellos están en
[53:30] esclavitud el profeta Dice que allá en
[53:33] cincinati
[53:35] él fue un
[53:37] zoológico y miró muchos animales
[53:41] ahí qu mir un león quizás mir un tigre
[53:46] pero hubo algo que llamó la atención de
[53:49] él hubo alguien que tocó su
[53:54] corazón una
[53:58] y í estaba un
[54:00] águila dice el profeta es la imagen más
[54:03] triste que yo haya
[54:06] visto esa águila estaba golpeándose en
[54:09] contra de esa
[54:12] jaula ella quería
[54:14] volar ella quería
[54:17] irse pero ella no
[54:19] podía porque había una jaula que la
[54:22] estaba
[54:24] encerrando dice alguien malvado le había
[54:27] robado la
[54:32] libertad el problema no estaba en sus
[54:36] alas porque sus alas eran fuertes para
[54:41] volar el problema no estaba en en las
[54:44] plumas de
[54:46] ella el problema no era en la
[54:50] naturaleza Ella tenía la naturaleza de
[54:53] águila
[54:55] aleluya ohy yo le digo esta
[54:57] mañana Usted no tiene la naturaleza de
[55:00] un
[55:02] halcón usted tiene la naturaleza de un
[55:05] águila usted tiene las alas de un
[55:08] águila usted tiene las plumas de un
[55:12] águila y esta mañana usted tiene la
[55:15] revelación de una
[55:17] u no hay jaula que pueda mantenerlo
[55:22] atado Somos libres esta mañana
[55:27] la biblia
[55:28] dice todo aquel que elijo libertar será
[55:31] verdaderamente
[55:34] libre Oh para eso vino la
[55:37] palabra para eso vino el
[55:40] mensaje no para atarnos en credos y
[55:43] dogmas no para atarnos en
[55:47] legalism pero para liberarnos en la
[55:50] libertad gloriosa hij de Dios
[55:54] [Aplausos]

[56:06] Señor hay depresión que nos ata muchas
[56:12] veces atados por
[56:16] nerviosismo atados por
[56:20] depresiones atados por
[56:23] ansiedad y usted va al doctor
[56:27] y el doctor le
[56:28] dice le voy a enseñar algunas técnicas
[56:31] de
[56:35] relajación para que usted pueda vivir
[56:37] con
[56:39] eso profeta de Dios
[56:42] dijo toda enfermedad es un
[56:45] [Aplausos]
[56:46] demonio usted no puede vivir con un
[56:48] demonio al
[56:51] lado tenemos un Dios
[56:59] que sobrepasa la
[57:01] luz que sobrepasa la
[57:04] materia que no nos enseña a vivir con
[57:07] las
[57:09] enfermedades él nos dijo que por su
[57:11] llaga hemos sido
[57:14] sanados somos libres esta
[57:18] mañana es solo ir al
[57:21] Calvario porque cuando vamos al Calvario
[57:29] ual no hay grandes y pequeños en el
[57:33] calvario Ah es que él es un
[57:36] predicador él puede ir al
[57:38] Calvario él predica
[57:41] bonito entonces él puede ir al
[57:44] Calvario pero yo no puedo ir al
[57:47] Calvario yo no tengo habilidades para ir

[58:43] alguien
[58:45] mayor alguien que derramó su sangre en

[58:51] Calvario para que pudiera tener
[58:53] compañerismo con él esta mañana
[58:59] dice
[59:02] amoria sea al
[59:04] señor todos somos iguales en el
[59:09] calvario pero vamos al mensaje si no me
[59:11] voy a tomar do horas
[59:18] hoy van a recamar hermano Mateo trajo un
[59:22] predicador tan extenso
[59:30] todo esto comenzó allá antes de la
[59:32] fundación del
[59:35] mundo cuando Dios dice el profeta ni
[59:40] siquiera era
[59:44] Dios él era él era la
[59:48] fuerza él era el autoexistente
[59:53] él era Elohim
[59:57] él habitaba en sí
[59:59] mismo podemos ir allí atrás en el
[1:00:03] pasado dice el profeta parémonos en Los
[1:00:06] barandales de la
[1:00:12] eternidad y veamos lo que pasó en el
[1:00:17] principio yo no creo que somos más que
[1:00:21] nadie pero tenemos una mente profética
[1:00:28] y con la mente deo podemos ver lo que
[1:00:30] pasó
[1:00:33] allá ese Dios
[1:00:36] eterno ese Dios que todo lo
[1:00:40] puede ese Dios que lo llena to todo todo
[1:00:46] todo ese dios quería darse a conocer
[1:00:59] esa F de vida
[1:01:01] eter só una
[1:01:05] luz la Biblia le llama la
[1:01:09] palabra la Biblia le llama el
[1:01:14] verbo pero en el griego la Biblia llama
[1:01:16] el logos
[1:01:21] [Aplausos]
[1:01:29] descendió cond descendió y moró en esa
[1:01:35] luz
[1:01:37] era eso era
[1:01:40] Dios dándose a
[1:01:43] conocer Los Ángeles lo
[1:01:45] [Aplausos]
[1:01:47] vieron inmediatamente comenzaron a
[1:01:51] adorar supieron la única fente de vida
[1:01:59] ese Dios en ese momento amados
[1:02:04] hermanos estaba pensando en
[1:02:08] usted y estaba pensando en
[1:02:12] m Yo quiero decirle el es un
[1:02:18] mentiroso porque llega
[1:02:27] y le dice Tú no eres
[1:02:31] importante Tú no vales
[1:02:34] nada decirle desde el principio Dios
[1:02:38] pensó en
[1:02:41] usted antes de que Dios creara aú un
[1:02:47] ángel nosotros estábamos en la mente
[1:02:50] eterna de
[1:02:54] Dios é no se detuvo
[1:02:57] ahí él no se detuvo allí arriba en la
[1:03:02] eternidad él cond
[1:03:06] descendió y se hizo un
[1:03:10] cuerpo él creó
[1:03:13] materia porque nosotros vivimos en
[1:03:15] tiempo luz y
[1:03:19] materia materia es todo aquello que
[1:03:22] podemos tocar
[1:03:26] esto es
[1:03:28] materia el parlante que está aquí es
[1:03:32] materia la guitarra que está aquí es
[1:03:36] materia el pedazo de papel acá es
[1:03:41] materia todo lo que podemos
[1:03:44] palpar es materia el púlpito es
[1:03:49] materia él es materia
[1:03:53] también yo soy materia también
[1:03:56] usted es
[1:04:00] materia eso es lo que Dios
[1:04:03] hizo Dios hizo la
[1:04:06] materia y y cuando hizo esta
[1:04:11] tierra é él puso leyes en esta
[1:04:15] tierra hay una en la física estudia las
[1:04:18] leyes que hay en la
[1:04:22] Tierra pero aunque Dios haya hecho la
[1:04:24] materia
[1:04:28] a mí me encanta el Dios que
[1:04:31] servimos porque él no está atado a las
[1:04:33] leyes de la
[1:04:38] materia él va más allá de las leyes de
[1:04:40] la
[1:04:43] materia hay una
[1:04:45] ley aquí en la tierra que dice que mis
[1:04:51] pies deben permanecer en el
[1:04:54] suelo llama la fuerza de
[1:04:58] gravedad es una ley y pero pero a Dios
[1:05:03] no le importa la ley de
[1:05:07] gravedad los científicos dicen que Dios
[1:05:09] no puede romper las leyes de la
[1:05:14] física pero mi Biblia dice que a Dios no
[1:05:16] le importa las leyes de la
[1:05:20] gravedad hubo un hombre en el libro de
[1:05:22] Génesis
[1:05:26] tu
[1:05:27] hacer fue caminar con
[1:05:29] Dios y la ley de
[1:05:32] gravedad perdió su fuerza delante
[1:05:36] de yo creo yo s de un pueblo esta
[1:05:40] mañana que está caminando con
[1:05:43] Dios y un de estos la ley de
[1:05:48] gravedad perderá
[1:05:57] y los que hayamos
[1:06:00] quedado seros
[1:06:03] levantados y le veremos a él en el
[1:06:06] aire tocaremos a él le abrazaremos a
[1:06:12] él y estaremos para siempre con
[1:06:15] él alguien lo cree esta mañana dale a
[1:06:20] Dios a Dios no le importan las leyes de
[1:06:22] la materia
[1:06:27] las leyes de la materia me
[1:06:30] dicen que cuando este
[1:06:33] cuerpo pierde toda su
[1:06:38] energía está
[1:06:40] muerto y ahí termina la
[1:06:46] vida no hay amenes a
[1:06:53] eso es que eso no es para ustedes
[1:06:59] esa ley no no aplica a
[1:07:03] Dios Y tampoco aplica al pueblo de
[1:07:08] Dios cuando Dios se hizo
[1:07:11] materia no lo pudieron
[1:07:14] entender lo mal
[1:07:17] entendieron dijeron
[1:07:20] her Yo tengo un
[1:07:23] problema y se lo voy a decir
[1:07:27] yo he encontrado un error en
[1:07:31] usted y el hermano br dijo Yo espero que
[1:07:33] solo sea
[1:07:39] uno El problema es que usted hace mucho
[1:07:41] alar del Señor
[1:07:50] Jesús ese es el problema que tien
[1:07:52] hermano br
[1:07:55] Esa
[1:07:58] muchachita era una maestra de escuela
[1:08:02] dominical y ella su fe estaba basada en
[1:08:07] la cómo se llama se
[1:08:09] llama
[1:08:12] ciencia ciencia
[1:08:15] cristiana y la ciencia cristiana enseña
[1:08:20] algo que la
[1:08:23] mente está por encima
[1:08:27] que si usted tiene un dolor de
[1:08:29] cabeza y usted dice no tengo
[1:08:33] nada no tengo
[1:08:36] nada todo está en mi
[1:08:39] mente su mente es capaz de sanarlo a
[1:08:43] usted eso es lo que explica la ciencia
[1:08:48] cristiana pero profeta
[1:08:50] dice no es la ciencia sobre la materia
[1:08:57] es fe es el poder de Dios para
[1:09:03] sanar le dijo al
[1:09:07] profeta Jesús era solamente un
[1:09:11] hombre profeta dijo dem sus
[1:09:16] argumentos es que é
[1:09:24] lloró era un problema para
[1:09:27] ella pero nosotros lo entendemos esta
[1:09:30] mañana tenemos un mensaje que es la
[1:09:32] palabra
[1:09:34] revelada y ese mensaje nos
[1:09:37] dice que él era hombre en la
[1:09:42] carne pero era Dios en el

[1:15:15] 16 tenían que ser 16 sabía dónde lo
[1:15:18] había

[1:18:53] Jesucristo
[1:18:57] [Aplausos]
[1:18:58] Qué necesitamos en estos

[1:23:09] mí y me dijo Yo estoy viviendo en el
[1:23:11] último

[1:23:37] Humano
[1:23:40] común nosotros no vivimos solamente de
[1:23:43] luz
[1:23:45] cósmica porque la revelación de la
[1:23:48] palabra nos
[1:23:50] dice que el día que venimos a

[1:24:10] usted Este cuerpo
[1:24:13] muestra que la luz cósmica se está
[1:24:18] acabando a mí no me importa
[1:24:20] eso porque dentro de mi alma
[1:24:25] hay una luz
[1:24:26] eterna que no puede ser acabada
[1:24:31] apagada los cielos y tierra
[1:24:34] pasarán pero su palabra no

[1:25:28] repararlo para que usted siga su
[1:25:31] camino y siga creciendo su en el
[1:25:34] señor alguien cree que puede
[1:25:37] hacerlo Yo creo que puede
[1:25:39] hacerlo una vez esa
[1:25:42] luz una vez esa
[1:25:45] luz se hizo
[1:25:47] carne y caminó entre
[1:25:49] nosotros y se encontró con un hombre
[1:25:52] ciego
[1:25:54] no había perdido la
[1:25:57] vista había nacido sin
[1:26:01] ojos se acercó a
[1:26:04] él y le
[1:26:06] dijo los discípulos le dijeron a él qué
[1:26:10] pasó con este hombre quién
[1:26:13] pecó pecó
[1:26:15] él o pecaron sus
[1:26:18] padres el mundo siempre está buscando
[1:26:23] explicaciones
[1:26:25] explicaciones él trae la solución al
[1:26:28] problema Dios es
[1:26:31] acción Dios no es
[1:26:33] teoría Dios es acción é dijo No se
[1:26:37] preocupen yo puedo
[1:26:40] repararlo ni él
[1:26:42] pecó ni sus padres
[1:26:45] pecaron es para que la gloria de Dios
[1:26:47] sea
[1:26:50] manifestada hay cosas que ocurren
[1:26:53] iglesia no por
[1:26:55] pecados no por
[1:26:57] errores es porque Dios está
[1:27:00] esperando que usted pueda creerle a él y
[1:27:03] tomarlo en su
[1:27:06] palabra Gloria a Dios él tomó tierra de
[1:27:11] los tomó polvo de la
[1:27:14] tierra Porque porque ese ciego había
[1:27:17] hecho había
[1:27:20] nacido o había sido hecho de la Tierra
[1:27:25] lo que iba a reparar era
[1:27:28] materia entonces iba a tomar
[1:27:31] materia y
[1:27:35] escupió Oh qué cosa más
[1:27:39] asquerosa lodo hecho con
[1:27:45] saliva y vas a dejar hombre ciego que él
[1:27:49] te ponga esa saliva en los ojos
[1:27:55] eso se ve
[1:28:00] feo V a dejar lo que lo
[1:28:05] haga él sabía que era la única forma de
[1:28:10] venir tomó saliva tomó polvo de la
[1:28:13] Tierra y la puso en sus
[1:28:16] ojos y
[1:28:19] aqu empezó empezó a materializarse
[1:28:25] y a crear
[1:28:28] ojos cuando Dios necesitaba
[1:28:31] reparar
[1:28:33] materia el cuerpo de un
[1:28:36] hombre usó
[1:28:39] materia Pero cuando Dios necesita
[1:28:41] reparar el alma de
[1:28:43] alguien Oh él no va a usar polvo de la
[1:28:47] tierra va usar su
[1:28:49] palabra es por eso que venimos a la
[1:28:52] iglesia porque porque su palabra es
[1:28:55] predicada
[1:28:56] ahí y el libro de salmos
[1:28:59] dice que él ha enviado su
[1:29:02] palabra Para sanar nuestras
[1:29:04] enfermedades y librarnos de la
[1:29:07] ruina
[1:29:09] aleluya gloria a Dios Usted dice eso fue
[1:29:13] hace 2000
[1:29:16] años en los
[1:29:19] 60 uneta
[1:29:23] [Música]
[1:29:27] cuenta que tampoco tenía
[1:29:30] ojos y se acercó al siervo de
[1:29:34] Dios el mismo Dios que el mismo Don que
[1:29:37] estaba en
[1:29:39] Cristo estaba en su
[1:29:42] profeta cuando la muchachita se
[1:29:45] acercó y le dijo Yo quiero recibir mi
[1:29:50] vista é le dijo tú crees que Dios puede
[1:29:53] hacerlo
[1:29:55] Ella dijo claro que Dios puede hacerlo
[1:29:58] él se
[1:29:59] agachó y empezó a orar por ella y empezó
[1:30:03] a decir señor
[1:30:06] crea señor
[1:30:08] crea crea
[1:30:10] ojos espera un
[1:30:13] momento qué color quieres los
[1:30:19] ojos
[1:30:21] hermanos quizá yo estoy loco porque yo
[1:30:24] no vi esa
[1:30:25] cosa pero yo lo
[1:30:28] creo yo no vi a Jesús pero yo le creo yo
[1:30:33] no vi a William br pero yo creo que este
[1:30:36] es su
[1:30:37] mensaje y que Dios se movió
[1:30:40] ahí Y sabes por lo creo porque él es el
[1:30:44] mismo Ayer hoy por todos los siglos
[1:30:46] Jesucristo
[1:30:48] [Aplausos]
[1:30:54] me llené de
[1:30:57] tierra pero me dijeron que estaba en
[1:31:03] casa sabes qu puede hacer
[1:31:07] Dios si el problema es con la
[1:31:12] materia Dios puede Dios puede reparar
[1:31:17] eso voy a terminar
[1:31:22] acá hace casi do
[1:31:27] años nació mi segundo
[1:31:30] hijo y yo estaba
[1:31:33] contento porque iba a abrazar a mi
[1:31:36] segundo
[1:31:39] hijo el mayor de mis hijos está aquí
[1:31:43] conmigo pero el pequeño
[1:31:45] olam nació el año pasado el año
[1:31:50] antepasado Y entonces cuando él nació
[1:31:54] fue una sorpresa no agradable que vino
[1:31:57] con
[1:32:00] él porque cuando lo vimos parecía que
[1:32:04] todo estaba
[1:32:08] bien mi esposa pudo quien estaba con mi
[1:32:12] esposa me mandó una foto del
[1:32:18] niño yoes comencé a ver la fotografía
[1:32:24] dije quiero que te fijes en las orejas
[1:32:25] del
[1:32:28] niño y cuando ella se
[1:32:31] fijó ella me mandó a
[1:32:35] llamar sucede que los
[1:32:40] conductos estaban
[1:32:43] cerrados y una de sus
[1:32:46] orejas estaba más pequeña que la
[1:32:49] otra nosotros no sabíamos qué
[1:32:52] hacer sa los hospitales en
[1:32:56] Honduras ellos no ellos no dan
[1:33:00] explicaciones ni siquiera sabían lo que
[1:33:02] estaba
[1:33:04] pasando mi esposa tenía una
[1:33:09] cesárea entonces esa misma
[1:33:12] noche conseguimos la
[1:33:15] orden para llevarlo llevar a mi niño a
[1:33:18] otro doctor
[1:33:26] el
[1:33:27] pediatra lo
[1:33:30] revisó y dijo no podemos hacer nada
[1:33:34] ahorita váyanse a casa y a los días a
[1:33:39] los
[1:33:40] meses y ustedes hagan este este y este
[1:33:47] examen vayan con un
[1:33:51] audiólogo Cuando llegamos a la primera
[1:33:53] cita con el
[1:33:57] audiólogo él ella revisó eh al
[1:34:04] niño estaba tan cerrado el
[1:34:09] canal de su lado derecho del lado
[1:34:12] derecho de mi niño que casi no podía ver
[1:34:15] lo que había
[1:34:17] dentro el otro oído tenía el agujero un
[1:34:20] poquito más grande
[1:34:24] Así que puso un aparatito allí
[1:34:29] adentro y él dijo ella dijo no veo el
[1:34:35] tímpano y parece allá adentro que que
[1:34:39] que no se formó el oído
[1:34:46] interno Y en el otro
[1:34:49] oído metieron algo muy delgado
[1:34:55] y cuando vieron
[1:34:57] adentro Ella
[1:34:59] dijo No veo nada
[1:35:05] tímpano cuando ella nos dijo
[1:35:08] eso mi esposa empezó a
[1:35:11] llorar ella le dijo No se preocupe vamos
[1:35:14] vamos a hacer una prueba para ver si él
[1:35:16] está recibiendo sonido
[1:35:31] emp a ver su
[1:35:34] máquina pori horas enviando señales de
[1:35:38] sonido a los oídos del
[1:35:42] niñ despu
[1:35:46] horas hauch
[1:35:55] y está y el oído interno no se
[1:36:01] formó Cuántas son madres
[1:36:04] aquí se imaginan cómo se sintió mi
[1:36:10] esposa estaba
[1:36:13] destrozada inmediat el domingo
[1:36:16] siguiente yo empecé a mandar
[1:36:20] textos a los ministros
[1:36:23] y a los amigos que tengo en otros
[1:36:26] lugares la iglesia comenzó a
[1:36:28] orar hermano Luis y la iglesia de él
[1:36:31] comenzaron a
[1:36:32] orar empezamos a orar a orar y a orar
[1:36:35] por dos
[1:36:37] meses porque nosotros
[1:36:40] veíamos que no podíamos aceptar lo que
[1:36:43] los médicos estuvieran
[1:36:46] diciendo Yo recuerdo que mi niño estaba
[1:36:51] dormido el perro estaba ladrando
[1:36:56] fuera mi niño mayor estaba jugando y
[1:36:58] tira la
[1:37:02] puerta y mi niño no se
[1:37:06] despertaba yo recuerdo que me acercaba
[1:37:09] al oído de mi
[1:37:12] niño y yo le decía Jesucristo es el
[1:37:15] mismo Ayer hoy por todos los siglos
[1:37:24] hermano yo no voy a hacer largo
[1:37:26] esto yo solo voy a decirle
[1:37:29] algo Dios es capaz de sobrepasar todo lo
[1:37:32] que la carne
[1:37:37] significa mi niño no tenía no tenía
[1:37:45] tímpano su oído interno no había sido
[1:37:50] desarrollado Así que fuimos hacer otro
[1:37:54] test otra
[1:37:57] prueba porque estábamos viendo
[1:38:00] algo que el niño estaba
[1:38:05] balbuceando entonces algo estaba pasando
[1:38:08] ahí cómo es que el niño no puede
[1:38:14] oír pero est
[1:38:18] balbuceando así que lo llevamos a otro
[1:38:20] doctor
[1:38:23] y lo llevamos con la referencia de la
[1:38:25] primer
[1:38:29] doctora él no puso todos los aparatos
[1:38:32] que puso la primera
[1:38:36] doctora solo miró con esa cosita que
[1:38:39] ellos
[1:38:42] tienen adentro y
[1:38:45] dijo volvió a
[1:38:48] ver no tiene
[1:38:51] tímpano losos interno no se
[1:38:55] formar y volví a
[1:38:59] ver volvió a
[1:39:02] agarrar y volvió a
[1:39:04] ver y me dijo tómele una foto a la
[1:39:10] computadora porque en toda mi
[1:39:13] experiencia toda mi experiencia me
[1:39:16] dice que es es un tímpano
[1:39:23] [Aplausos]
[1:39:30] usted dice quizás se equivocó el
[1:39:35] doctor No señor eso es lo que el enemigo
