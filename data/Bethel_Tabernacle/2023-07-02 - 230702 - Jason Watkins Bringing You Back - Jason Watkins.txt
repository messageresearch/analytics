and smile at everybody say God bless you amen praise the lord it's good to be here today see all of your smiling faces and been a while since I've stood here with the purpose I have today but amen certainly trusting the Lord I appreciate all your prayer prayers of those here and those who are streaming I've had a lot of comments from around the world and I was up in Tennessee and had a quite a bit of people inquiring up there and different things and talking about hey man I said tomorrow's the big day well I um it's it's a wonderful opportunity for me I've I wish I could say I've enjoyed my six weeks off but I probably haven't enjoyed it amen wanting every day to be back in the saddle trying to use the better part of wisdom and follow the doctor's advice and so today I covet your prayers and I'm I've got a number of things to keep me from going crazy amen I brought my pencil so that it'll kind of keep me in a frame of mind to keep stay in the material and amen keep me from becoming a crazy man I don't normally wear my Apple watch when I preach because I get too excited and she thinks I'm being killed and tries to call 9-1-1 that's happened so many times and I've caught it sometimes with within seconds before it dialed the number and so uh so today I've I've got it set to um keep up with my heart rate that's that's actually been the problem whenever I would exert and that's why the doctor The Specialist told me you've got to stop preaching she knew I was rather charismatic and she said whenever you which she was right I knew because whenever I'd exercise that's when I would feel the the back pressure building up in my eye and so uh she said You Know You're vulnerable for a little while to for it to resurface again I said you mean a third time she said oh yeah this thing can just keep keep coming and I said well it can come I thought to myself it can come and come and come but the devil still ain't nobody and we don't we don't regard him not not worried about him because I know that the Lord is in control of my life and my Ministry this is his ministry anyway it's his gift not mine I'm not the gift at all uh I'm just a vessel he placed a piece of Machinery in and um he turns it on and turns it off he uses it preaches through it amen so when you're rejoicing over the word I am too I'm right there with you amen it's wonderful to me as well but I um I'm under advice to just not and that's always my problem is balance I'm always going harder at it than I need to but as you know man it just is like a seven course meal and you sit down and I love to eat everybody knows that and uh the word gets so delicious and I just become into a jubilee and so I'm not not making any claims that I won't hit Jubilee today but I'm going to try to measure it out and um what might happen today is since I can't go extreme I might have to go longer oh for good praise the Lord so you just bear with me and um so as we we want to look into the word of God I've got so much I want to say so many sermons piles and piles of them over these six weeks the Lord has not stopped the fountain that's for sure my problem is I want to preach them all at once so I can't keep y'all here till eight o'clock tonight so we're going to just have to get what's on our heart today I'm quite sure I won't finish it I'm not going to try but I'm going to kind of you might see me doing that I'm just kind of monitoring and just just trying to be use a little wisdom that'd be all right amen so God bless you we want to turn to Ephesians chapter 2 this morning brother Luther we have a request from Brother Caleb to send a prayer cloth with brother Bradley and sister back today someone just I'm Gonna Leave the whole package laying there and try not to let me forget that amen my I'm I'm looking forward to our meetings coming up at the end of this month and I was with brother Daryl in Tennessee and he's looking forward to it a lot and uh so hey that that's what we'll do y'all y'all get plenty of Jubilee preaching at the end of the month so just be patient amen praise the Lord I promise you we're going to have a good good time amen Ephesians chapter 2 verse 1 to 5. I want to speak today on a title bringing you back bringing you back verse one and you hath he quickened who were dead in trespasses and sins wherein in time past you walked according to the course of this world according to the prince of the power of the air the spirit that now worketh in the children of Disobedience now Paul is not trying to hurt your feelings okay he's just trying to make a comparison to say look we all were born in sin we all at one time police says another place at one time we all had our conversation in the lust of the flesh and the things of the world and we were by very nature we Paul were by very nature the children of Wrath even as others God who was rich in Mercy loved us while we were even still a sinner imagine how much he loves you now that you've surrendered your life to him see not that he loves you more you can't make him love you more or less but look at what opportunities you are providing for him now I want you to absorb that you let alone you are providing opportunities for great big God brother Brown said he has no hands but yours no feet but yours no mouth but yours amen we are his continuation his ministry continuing in the earth does that thrill you as much as it does me so Paul is not trying to insult us he's trying to make a contrasting comparison here so so that he can show you in contradistinction what you used to be but you're not that anymore say well I'm still a long ways off from where I want to be but you're not what you used to be huh calm down calm down but God verse 4. oh wait verse 3. among whom also we all had our conversation end times past in the lust of our flesh fulfilling the desires of the flesh we did come on we did we did might as well own it and of the Mind yep guilty been there done that got the T-shirt and we're by Nature the children of Wrath even as others now Paul's going to go on to prove to you we're not going to get into it today but he's going to prove to you that that nature he's referring to wasn't your original nature it was something put on You by a sin birth your original nature come from God that's why you believe his word you believe his word now do you know why you say Amanda's word now because in the in the eons of time back before there was time and morning Stars sang together and sons of God shouted for Joy there was a great battle that took place and some of the some of the Angelic beings refused to say Amen any longer but some of the God's angels and all of God's elected family continued to say Amen to the word you say Amen today because you're reliving your life back there brother remember says just to Veil over your memory you don't remember that see oh my what is what will it be when we get over Yonder but God who is rich in Mercy not just was but is for his great love wherewith he loved us even when we were dead in sins hath quickened us together with Christ by Grace ye are saved amen let's pray Master we thank you today and I'm grateful to be standing here Lord I'm I'm I'm I feel myself hurrying to just get out of the way Lord I'm just looked forward to this time and I just want you to take over now father and bring forth your word Lord we're we're showing up for duty today Lord I have one Express purpose there are numerous things that I'm numerous purposes that I have in my heart but one of the foremost purpose that I have standing here today is to cast out devils and Lord I know that the preaching of the Gospel drives back spirits of unbelief it Cast Away Devils out of the people's minds so that the Holy Spirit can deal with their hearts and get the necessary minerals and vitamins and nutrients and elements of the word of God that we need for this hour so Lord I put Satan on notice he might as well run for it now now because the word is going to pound him oh God I pray today that you'll let the people forget about yesterday don't worry about tomorrow we're here right now and we're ready to hear the word of God I commit it to you in Jesus name amen God bless you as you're seated you know the word of God cast out Devils did you know that you know I was I was um speaking here a couple of days ago to a a young sister a very fine young woman believer very loyal to God and and uh you know she had she had written to me and asking for some time perhaps with sister Debbie and I if we could have some time to sit down together some questions on her mind and things the enemy troubling her with and so I I wrote back to say that be just fine sis right now we're in North Carolina and we're trying to get back and then we know more than got back and we had to leave again and and time went on and so I managed to follow up with her and I said hey so this week it'd be great sister Dave and I have some time and she wrote back to say brother Jason it's all good she said the Lord answered all my questions in a sermon brother Matt preached on Sunday and she said uh Mom it's all good and I thought to myself you know here here here here's what happened and I want you to I want you to grasp this because this isn't a fairy tale this is actually what happened in another realm you know there's another realm Beyond this one you know that you you you have very limited sight you have very limited comprehension you don't even see all the wavelengths of light actually in science we'll tell you there are many wavelengths of light you don't see an infrared you don't see ultraviolet you don't see you actually they say your visible site is a very little tiny in a long chart a visible way of of wavelength and only a little bit of it is visible to you that this is why you should just let God run your life this is why you don't see over that mountain you're you know it's in your way but the Lord and you know you're here needing and praying and asking to do this and he's he's listening but he's looking over the mountain going uh nope can't do that because you don't know what you're going to face over here but I do so I'm gonna I'm gonna have to keep you right here in this training I know you don't like it but you're gonna have to keep training a little while because when you get over here you're going to need that and you go when you get over here you're going to remember back and you're going to thank me Lord thank you amen for guiding my life and I and I thought to myself how that the word of God cast out devils and it drives back spirits of unbelief you know the sister didn't get smarter that's not how she got through it it's not that suddenly she had more common sense or suddenly she got more brilliant she's already brilliant it's not that she got more brilliant and figured it out you know what happened the what was her problem was not intelligence her problem was not comprehension but there's an evil spirit troubling her mind and the word of God preaching cast him away and then the Holy Spirit revealed his word and it fixed the problem I'd say to you today open up your heart and your mind to the word of God I promise you it has an answer for every problem you could ever have every question and brother Branham said you know speaking of the Hidden manner the future aspect of the Hidden manner that it will be the Eternal unfolding of the revelation of Jesus Christ in the ceaseless ages brother M says all the questions you ever had everything you wondered at will be known over there and you know I'm gonna one of the greatest things I don't know about you you say I I want to know more about Christ I do I do too but you know one of the most perplexing questions I have the one of the things that I'm going to want to know more about when I get over there is I'm going to want to understand more about me why was I so weak at times why did I fail so often why didn't I let the devil do this why did that you know and and brother Brandon said when you cross over the first thing that'll go through your mind I'm glad a prophet knows the first thing that'll go through my mind so the first thing that'll go through your mind when you cross over is you ready why was I ever worried I'll be over there and you'll sit down under a tree start thinking about life and all the things you worried about on this side and he said you'll sit down under a tree and just laugh my goodness how did I how what was I worried about I always was the son of God I was always going to get I was always going to get here hallelujah so but you know here we we find that we come through life at the according to the plan of God in Redemption and God was never interested in building a robot economy or robot Kingdom he's not interested in having AI Androids you know be part of his kingdom he wanted people who had Souls who could make a choice who could who could choose him you know I I didn't want a a wife that was forced to marry me I wanted a wife that chose to marry me you know I it's it's it's all about A Love Affair and and so this is what exactly what God wanted and him you know needing and his needs as a redeemer and as a Healer and as a savior to fulfill his his uh his nature and his characteristics I'm just so happy today that I got to be a part of fulfilling his needs you know it's interesting I've I've seen the you know the the the I don't know they want to call it their writings their essays or whatever of agnostics and atheists and I don't read that um and read their stuff very often and if I read it at all it's just to try to understand how they could possibly come to that conclusion trying to figure out a way I can helps see and so I get a little bit of gain out of it like that there's no chance for the devil to dissuade me from the word of God because he's already tried that back in the eons and he failed I was a Believer then I'm a Believer now I'll always be a believer and so because I realize that I'm part of the word that I'm believing and so I could no more deny it than I could deny my own self and it really wouldn't matter what my body would do or my brain or my mind or decisions in my heart I simply there is another another Jason Watkins down inside of me saying Amen to the word and warring against the the Fallen nature in my flesh to bring it under subjection and I'm glad to report to you today that I'm a Christian which means the real me is winning and I want to go on winning and I intend to win I intend to spend my life you people can the world can have it they want fortune and Glory have at it all right fine Brother Branham said don't even don't even you know I forget the word he uses the the thinking is you know don't don't be too hard on the on the center here with his cigarettes and his booze and his gambling and his all of this and brother M said that's the only enjoyment he's ever going to know he's one and done I never wanted to be one and done I I read the testimony of you know I was reading the other day a couple of very famous men one was a very famous politician one was a another uh um a movie star from back in the day and you know here they are neither one of them believe in the afterlife they just think that's it when you die you're done and I thought boy what a what a rude awakening you're gonna have one or two seconds after you die think about that an Awakening after you die you're gonna have a rude awakening after you die because no one's actually died yet and everyone that's ever lived in the earth is still alive today somewhere and they were asking him you know so what do you what are you you're old now what do you think about you've had all the fortune and glory of the world and uh you know you've had all the money women in popularity you could ever have and you've had enough to satisfy a thousand men and and and and and and now here you are at the end and he said and he actually said he said you know he said I'm not afraid to die he said I'm just I'm just mad I'm just mad that I have to and you you could see that there's a desire in him I want to keep living I don't want to die I love life I don't I don't want to see it end and I'm so glad I thought to myself I closed my eyes and a shiver went through me and I thought Lord I'm so glad to know that that life is not ended in death that there's another world just beyond this one brother Branham said a continuation of this same life in another place I'm glad for the gospel the world may not want it but I love it I'm glad for the Holy Ghost the world doesn't want it but I love it Hallelujah foreign to think that I have a part in Redemption and I have a pardon an integral part you do you have an integral part you know in God's Plan of Redemption you say can you quantify or unqualify just how important my part is the rapture can't go without you being in you're holding up if you're not in and you're elected to be in you're holding up 2 000 years of church history you're holding up 2 000 years worth of saints who are earnestly or eagerly waiting for their change as much as you're waiting here you are longing to be there and they're they're longing to be back here Hallelujah they want to be back in their bodies again they're in a word body a theophany body theophonic condition but you know they don't eat and different things like that but they're longing because they're they're not living you say they're in the paradise of God indeed but they're not living a full life yet see and I'm on this side and I've got I've got the body still that they would like to have again but they've got a condition a world that I would like to have I'm glad God's going emerge the two together and we're gonna live here in bodies and we're gonna we're we're gonna we're going to life we're going to live Hallelujah past never more to have to come back here and do this again and anguish and sin and sorrow and hardship and things like that I'm sorry I just have to keep check on that [Laughter] please don't let it distract you even if I just take a quick glance amen and I also got to make sure it doesn't start buzzing and dialing a number but but we find that that's how important you are the Rapture can't go without you you're holding me up and everybody up you're holding God up well there's a silver lining you're you're holding the Antichrist up because he can't begin his ride till we get out of here and if you're the last one that ain't surrendered yet and I'm here to tell you all eyes are on you I I don't want to be the guy on the other side that everybody goes boy were you really holding us up man we were watching and saying my goodness what is he waiting somebody hit him somebody do something but God is bringing us back from this life of Sorrow God's in the restoration business he's in rescue and Recovery he's the greatest rescue and Recovery organization that you ever heard about and you know Adam and Eve they were they were told about Redemption when God gave them bloody skins those bloody skins portended Redemption they they they were a statement where God is saying you know as they're going out and brother Branham says you know those those bloody skins smacking against their legs as they walked dripping with Lamb's blood and and God is he's saying to them how I've got to send you out of the garden you can't stay here anymore in this condition because the tree of life is here and lest you break through and partake of it in your Fallen condition and live forever and mess up the whole plan I'm gonna have to send you out of here I love you but I gotta send you out of my direct presence like this but I I've wrapped you in skins and that's my message of saying to you the last thing you hear me say as you leave the garden is I will bring you back brother Branham said when God seen his creation laying face down in ruin he said he didn't he didn't do away with it he said he he he he started immediately building it back because he's God and he won't be defeated Hallelujah I'm so glad today that he can't be defeated because I get defeated all the time but he can't be defeated and so this is this means a lot to us as we hear Brother Brannon like only a prophet could you know it takes a prophet to go into the mind of God and go all the way back to the to the back parts of God's mind and even even way back I mean it took a profit to discern the Sacred Hearts of Lucifer when when the prophet says oh I got your number loose the first son of the morning how are you falling from Heaven you think you're hiding your intention I'm about to out you to the whole world I'm going to put in a book and it's going to be the best seller for all the all the history no Prophet don't do it secretly I'm gonna tell them you said you set up don't don't that's that's top secret you have no right you said in your heart I will Ascend I will be like the most high God I'll establish my kingdom in the north and and and and and and that's what you are intending to do and here today friends I'm here to tell you you've got access to the very thoughts and intents just like they told the king of Syria when he goes down trying to find it uh Elisha and and uh and every every time you know he goes against Israel to fight him to entrap them Elisha just goes and tells the king here's where they are here's what they're going to do you can go around come up around and surround them I mean you're talking about a hack and he's like hacking life he's hacked the whole Army and the next thing you know serious losing tens of thousands of men until the king says who is a traitor Among Us and thankfully there was somebody that had enough courage to say your majesty ain't none of us traitors but Israel has a prophet who tells the king of Israel what you're thinking in your bed chamber now if you can imagine be the king of Syria for a minute you concoct a plan You're Gonna Go capture the man who knows what you're thinking in your bed chamber good luck with that I mean that's not that's that's dumb oh my be like be like sister uh Emily Curtis that's dumb and so but he actually tries to pull it off and sends an army I'm thinking wow I wouldn't want to be the general who gets the order to go down and capture a man who knows what we're doing and knows we're coming and then when he finds them Elisha just blinds them he don't have to do anything he don't have to pick up his sword his poof okay you're blind walks right out and talks to him let him know who he is oh you're looking for Elisha oh come on I'll show you where he's at and he you know gets a message to the king hey I'm going to lead him right into the Trap set it up no I'll I'll lead him right in and I'll get out of the way and you can spring the Trap and you got them oh my so so God so you've got a prophet now coming to us to say I know the secret in the back part of God's mind wow Elijah do tell well the first thing you need to know is God only has one motive and objective one goal in all the Bible really yes 66 books covering thousands of years yep one goal yep what is it expression all the people and all the Bible and everything you've ever read in the Bible is all God leading to one thing expression did he pull it off he did the prophets priests and kings were living out in real time portions of their life that that literally foretold what Christ would be when he arrived when God became flesh that's why it wasn't hard for the family of God who believed the word of God to identify it when it became flesh because it meant it matched it had the same nature it spoke the same way said the same things Jesus said to the religious leaders of his day why is it you don't understand my speech why are my words strange to you he was doing nothing but repeating everything they claimed to have studied since children and here he was the living representative of it he was actually all of the word they had studied in a human it was all summed up in a man and and the family of God says that's the Messiah who didn't say that I am this that or the other but who do you say they are the Son of God but those and even Devils even when he come to Legion even those Devils Cried Out Jesus thou Son of God see the family of God recognized him Devils recognized him they knew that that he had defeated them they didn't hadn't forgotten that but the religious leaders of the day called him be Elizabeth not just the devil the chief of devils and so so you find then that that that now a prophet says see it was all that his goal his one single goal has been distributed in three stages right first to make himself fully known in Jesus Christ the complete encapsulation of all the prophets priests and kings second was to gain preeminence in his church through the Holy Ghost see now everything that brother Branham is telling us top secret Intel everything he said is historical he be everything in Christ and then for two thousand years he gained preeminence in his church well that's that was then but this is now brother Branham what about now glad you asked the third part the final part the finishing part are you glad to be part of the finishing part the finishing part is to restore the kingdom that's you and me to restore the kingdom to its rightly position that fell by sin in the garden back in Adams day back under the first Adam now listen friends this is exactly why the you know the upper room experience when you have it you say praise God I've been redeemed you have part of you has but I'm not I'm I'm not satisfied neither is God satisfied with having a part of me redeemed he's trying to bring you in your body as the real you as the complete you not a part of you to bring you back to what you would have been in the garden before it fell you're not going that's why brother Branham said Canaan was not the Millennium because they still have thought and had War where you're going there'll be no war you won't have to fight anymore oh glory be to God he's restoring me back to where the greatest battle that's ever fought has been won and done now that's in process right now and that's already having an effect not just affecting where we can sit here today and be glad and rejoice that God is and we get affected by the fact that it's bringing my body subject but that's an effect that's God affecting change places you used to go you don't anymore that's an effective change things you used to say and do you didn't just get affected you got affected God has affected change I want you to know he ain't done Hallelujah is right you should be glad and rejoice because he ain't done he's still working on me he's still working on you this is what keeps me going on a daily basis I regret my failures I do you do we do all together but he ain't done and I'm still going forward and that's the important thing that you keep going forward it's not about perfection it's about progress we're coming to Perfection you can't finish the last part of it brother Tim was preaching on that Friday night if you didn't hear any of the dedication meetings in Tennessee he was preaching about how that Moses built the Tabernacle and the Bible says and Moses completed all the work that he was assigned to do and it was finished it's like Solomon finished but but but the Tabernacle wasn't finished it wasn't finished until it was filled with the glory of God Solomon did all he could do in building the Temple but it wasn't Solomon was finished Moses was finished they had done all they could do but it wasn't finished God had to fill it with Glory we're serving and we're doing all we can but I still can't change my body but there's somebody that can [Applause] you can repent of your sins you can start cleaning up your life you can do all that you can do but you still need the glory of God to fill your vessel you're not born again until you do we didn't you know when you think about the early church you didn't have a church until the Holy Ghost came you had people Gathering she didn't have a church because the church is the Ecclesia the the church was the continuation of his life and so I want you to think now what God is restoring you too say can you line it out for me in really good detail I can and it's easy all right because I can take you back on a little journey and you'll easily go with me in your mind's eye to see what say how will I see what I would have been had there not been a fall by looking at Adam before the fall and there's three things that I want to point out to you today that Adam was unique from you first of all Adam had nothing behind him no no parents back there who had this complex or this problem and it jumped two generations and fell on me nothing from a distant uncle or a distant brother Ram talked about strains in a family remember that remember the young man who had who is engaged and he became rigid and and and and and and he had insulted and his fiancee and he he was in the wrong dead to rights and he and he wouldn't apologize he wouldn't repent because his his mother's family had been like that now his mom wasn't see but brother Brandon when he's it's brother Adam's nephew and he's there with his brother saying look here's the problem he said he's got this thing that come on him at Birth and said it come through the mother and there she's sitting there he said now not you sister the Holy Ghost made you different the Holy Ghost took all that out of you but look at how your family is you walk down the street and wave at him they don't wave back you walk up to the fence he said I've walked up to the fence and said mighty nice day they just stare at me and he said I say well I hope to see at church sometime God bless you and he said they just stare you it was like an arrogance and they there that strain runs in that family and he said to his brother he said now look come on you know as well as I know we our whole families Fighters and drunkards and killers and thieves and no good and Bootleggers he said but now you're not like that why why because the Holy Ghost broke the cycle [Music] oh I love it that the Holy Ghost can break that cycle but we still have to fight those are things that are strains that run in families that you have to keep you have certain propensities that that you were born with you know I mean the these and I've there's a whole sermon I don't want to get into that because I'm still planning my family values uh series and and I don't want to go too far down that path but but but those kinds of strains you know get on just like I I've said you know to you before just in one example you know there's there's many vices that have had tremendous sway in my life before the Lord got a hold of my life but one of them wasn't gambling now that's a disease of that's a demon men I've been around men like that and they can't resist it they'll they'll gamble on on anything unless God delivers them and so but that was not I I I told you a funny story how I played a a game of poker and cards one time and I lost like a dollar and 85 Cent I was mad for days I couldn't believe it somebody had my 1.85 and I earned it and and I what an idiot see so it's not something that would get me because I don't have that propensity but I did have propensity to other weaknesses see and so you know there's even the thing today you know in the in the in the in the whole boy I'm just I don't know why I keep getting pulled in this I don't want to go this way but but you know just that if it might help you you know there's there's the whole political ideology there's not really any scientific data too much to to prove it and although all those scientific data does show elements of it about you know men who live perverted Lifestyles and women who live perverted lifestyles in in same-sex relationships and we're just quick to say oh that's just a devil well nobody's born like that well you'd first of all you've got to understand yes that is a devil but it's a devil who has taken advantage of an of a propensity in the nature of that person now that is scientifically proven it's not nobody's born homosexual but there are people who can't be born with that effeminate slant listen brother Branham talked about the food we eat and hybrid he says is is actually metamorphosing he says you notice that that that that men that women are getting narrow in the hips and men are having the vice versa and he actually talked about how that it's altering the DNA and he said the food is killing us it's literally wiping out a generation uh Generations it's it's leading to an Extinction event so these things are real we're not afraid of that we're just aware that's why I pray over everything I eat the power of prayer sanctifies it but but you have to realize that this world and brother Branham even talked about the incense he said it's it's our bodies are you know he talked about men back in the day who could fight 110 rounds in a heavyweight boxing match bare knuckled and around wasn't a timer you didn't get Saved by the Bell around was when you knocked the man off his feet that ended around you started another one and that fight 110 knockdowns till the till one of the men couldn't get up anymore he said Burly rugged many and he said today even men you find them in perfect physical fitness and strong and in the military and one Blow To The Head and they're gone and dying 40 and 50 years old just dropping dead men's Hearts failing for fear the world is is done Nature's done Nature's ready to get on with the new world that's why I've said to you young people your some of you are are going to college now whatever you do don't let those propaganda institutions pull you away from the mind of God and make you chase fortune and Glory this world is going to Ash and Cinder and you can't keep it you it's burning down you can't stay here we got to have a new world and a new body you look toward the manifestation of the word of God you're not always going to be able to understand Doctrine that's the advantage of the Holy Ghost you don't even need to the Holy Ghost can make you a new creation the Holy Ghost can show you ways you look for manifestation friends I'm not talking about chasing signs and wonders although that's an element of it brother Branham talked about the three definite evidences of what God called Ministries number one it'll be a Ministry established squarely on the word and it won't deviate it'll say Amen to every word and it'll only say what the word says it'll receive I'm here to tell you a god-sent ministry will receive the Elijah Ministry of this day period hands down and it will say what he said I'm not a parent I don't repeat just what he said I'm an eagle but I do preach what he taught secondly it will have signs following it and boy do we have some signs following we've had them right here in this little Church by the seaside how many miraculous things God has done it's appearing Cancers and opening up deaf ears and people be coming back to health again I'm not afraid to put the testimony of Jesus Christ to the test at Bethel Tabernacle and thirdly is the evident fruit the evident fruit of that life that we live and and that's that that is what is so profoundly important see is that you you can see the evidence of what God has done So Adam here's the beauty Adam had nothing behind him nothing to haunt him no Strain coming from somebody behind him that landed on him Adam had nothing behind him Adam had nothing upon him Satan couldn't come and accuse him of all the mistakes he had made like he can me like he can you like he does me like he does you amen none of that he had nothing upon him he had never forsaken God's word he had never committed a transgression in fact it is even the transgression he did was to save his wife out of love portraying Christ Christ also took your sin upon himself and became a sinner he who knew no sin just like Adam he who knew no sin became sin for Eve see and so so we realized that that that that it that protected Eve that saved her life God once Adam took Eve to himself and and mingled his seed in her body then God then now a part of Adam is actually physically inside her and God can't touch her she ought to have been burnt with the serpent that's what the prophet says but God couldn't put a hand on her just like Abraham now God hears Sarah and Sarah laughs and disbelieves the word of God by right she should have died but see but but but what saved say she was part of Abraham that savior that's accurate but brother Branham takes it a layer deeper is that she also believed the promise that Abraham spoke said God said to me and Sarah said I believe that I'm here to tell you God gave a revelation of Jesus Christ and he gave it to the church and the church says I believe it [Applause] and it was her faith in the promise just like Abraham it wasn't just that she was his wife she believed the promise that's what is your salvation friends that you believe the promise you have received the word that God has sent in this hour and you're not a make-believer you really believe it you don't always achieve it but you do believe it Adam had nothing behind him that's what God's restoring you to I'm so glad for that he had nothing on him and he had nothing within him he wasn't born in sin he had no Fallen nature just like Jesus when he told the disciples he says let us go Satan cometh but findeth nothing in me oh he had tried he had he had tried those Pharisees stood there and tried to do not deny his birth tried to go back and you know tried to go back and say you're just a man you're just a carpenter's son we know your dad we know your mom you're nobody you've even got a a smutty name about how you came into the Earth and what your mother did so and so and so and so and so and what they're simply saying to him is you're no different than us but that wasn't true Jesus had nothing behind him but God nothing upon him but but the word and nothing within him but pure faith I'm here to tell you something friends that's what God is spending 24 hours a day seven days a week to take you back and I just say thanks be to God I'm headed where there's nothing behind me and I don't have to worry about the strange or the complexes I don't have to worry about the propensities or the weaknesses there's nothing upon me he can't accuse me anymore it's all under the blood Hallelujah I'm Justified as though I never did in the first place and there's nothing within me I have passed from Death to life and I am a new creation God is constantly telling his family this all down through the scriptures he makes it very clear he says to Moses you're going to go and get the children and you're going to come back to this mountain Moses right here where I'm meeting you you're going to come back here Moses and you're going to bring those people with you at that point Moses needed to worry about nothing when he went to pharaoh and Pharaoh went and do it that didn't rattle Moses when the people got rattled and threatened to Stone him that didn't rattling nothing mattered to Moses because Moses knew I've already got a date with Destiny I'm coming back to that mountain and I'm bringing these people with me he told Jacob the same thing you'll come back here Jacob you're making a promise that you're going to serve me and I'm going to be your God and I'm going to bring you back there was a ladder and he sees angels in ascending and descending and there's the Son of God standing at the top of it talking to him I'm going to bring you back here Jacob I'm going to tell you something there were times in Jacob's life where it didn't feel very much like that there were times in his life he's running for his life he's running scared he's having to sneak and and connive and and be a scoundrel just just to live it doesn't feel very much like he's under the blessing of God it felt like he was in a prison why you think he wanted to leave and snuck out in the middle of the night and he's running for it trying to get a head start he knows his father-in-law chasing down and so he's running with his wives and his children and and the cattle that he had gotten through deceit and all this kind of thing and finally he gets a word and here comes Esau and he's coming to kill him and Jacob had to wrestle it out with the angel but here's what he knew that he promised me he'll bring me back I'm coming back that one that spoke to me and made me a promise you're here today I'm here today and he made me a promise that that there's a that he go went away to prepare a home for me that where he would be I could be also and in this life it doesn't always feel like that and sometimes I wonder can I even make it but I got a promise I got a promise he'll bring me back and he is bringing me back Israel was told as a nation you good Israel was told as a nation he would restore them he would heal them he said I know my plans for you plans of good not of harm I'm going to restore all the years that the canker worm and the caterpillar and the locus and the Palm worm have done my Army that I sent among you see so how many how many had in here had loyal parents that sent belts and Hickory switches among you amen all of these things that I sent among you but I but I know my plans for you and sometimes I know that life can get into such a situation and you wonder at your own self and you wonder at God and and as a human being brother Branham actually brother Brandon wasn't afraid to put it on put it put it in brass tacks and say you know we need to be able to see you know who is God and even if there is a God then let him come and prove himself and God would come night after night Prophet wasn't afraid to challenge just like Elijah you know Let The God Who Answers by fire and so Elijah had very little concern when he's filling the trench full of H2O and he's soaking the wood and soaking the sacrifice and after they're done he tells them do it again and do it again and keep doing it because it ain't gonna matter the fire that's coming ain't going to be stopped by science the fire that's coming nothing let me tell you something friends nor whatever happened in your past whatever kind of strain you were born with whatever was on your life whatever kind of Fallen nature nothing was going to stop the fire of the Holy Ghost from coming down and burning up the sacrifice I will restore you I'll bring you back brother Branham says in a paradox he says we find that among human beings we're prone to be that way he's talking about people wanting wanting something to do in it Israel wanted a law people always want to mess things up and figure out how they can work out their salvation you know with Works which you can't do and you know I'm I I'm I'm I've said it before that I'm very glad to know and and can prove by the Bible that not everybody that goes into the tribulation is going to hell the righteous King who loves life and loves Mercy whose Throne is established in Mercy is going to Grant some people eternal life at the end of at the Judgment bar it's his prerogative and it's not going to be based on works it's gonna because when they ask Jesus how do we work the works of God he said believe on him whom God hath sent that was the work that he needed you to do so when you read Matthew 25 you're not you're not seeing people get in because of a balance scale that they got 946 good and only 819 bad so they get to go in it's not that you can't get eternal life like that it's the king fortunately thank God knows the heart of the people thank God he knows your heart thank God he knows that even when you fail you still love him thank God he knows when you fail you'll repent because you didn't want to fail in the first place that's why he's so quick to forgive you it's why he's faithful if we confess our sins he's faithful and just to forgive us because he knows we didn't mean to do it anyway see and so say well but my flesh My Flesh did want it but your flesh ain't the real you your flesh is a hybrid Hallelujah the real you didn't want to do it else why'd you repent proves you didn't really want to do that friends I there's nothing in me that loves sin I'm done with sin I'm done with the world all my desires for the world are gone sure I still have fleshly temptations that I have to keep keep and Paul said I beat my body under subjection and and and so we we find that that now you you come to a place where where God is is changing you and he's molding you and and the thing that that gains them eternal life is the king can look into their heart and the only work he's looking for is what was your heart's response to the word when it was presented to you in whatever form if you weren't elected to see the message you can never see it anyway that's a that's his election that's God that doesn't mean they can't get eternal life they can be granted eternal life based on their that's why brother Brandon would say many will get in because they were kind to the bride what what were they doing they didn't understand the doctrine they wouldn't have understood it if you'd have tried or believed it or followed it if you tried to explain it to him but they saw you and they knew you're something more than they are and they respected that and oftentimes so it's so it's it's coming down to your heart's response and that's why many of them are going to fill up the new Earth having having freshly been freshly minted with eternal life boom enter into the joys of the Lord boom enter into the joys of the Lord prepared for you from the foundation of the world from the foundation meaning that when God started recording time his predestination knew who all that would be but that's not the elected the elected Jesus and the bride are the only ones in the entire Bible who were elected before the foundation of the world that's that's the only time you find that two scriptures two of them refer to Christ and one of them is in Ephesians refers to the bride you were elected in Christ before the foundation of the world because you you didn't get chosen you are an expression of him that's why real election understood correctly his origin it's not a lottery it's not a fortunate you got picked or you were good enough it has nothing to do with that it's expression I didn't my sons didn't choose to be my sons they are by birth and that's not unfair to the rest of the world that's just nature that is so that so but it's but but it's those who were in Christ he's there's only one elected son according to Isaiah 42 I was in him that's how I'm elected see so brother Branham says we find that among human beings speaking about trying to earn your way trying to do works we're prone to be that way now there's something there's a strain say that's something behind me man that's that's behind you all the way back to Fallen Adam that's what Adam did try to get fig leaves as soon as he fell he tried to do that that's on you from Adam that makes that's a human being see we're prone to be that way there is something we've got to do we feel that we've got to have something in it also now watch this brother Branham says you do have something into it that's your surrender of your own will your own ideas to the will and idea of almighty God and its finished you have the beautiful reality today to agree with the word of God from your heart and say now remember amen remember what that means so be it that you have the ability today to say Lord as unworthy as I am whatever I read in your word from my heart I say so be it unto me I don't care what you have to do I don't care what you have to change I don't care what you have to take from me I don't care what trials I go through I don't care what heart breaks I don't care what I have to separate from I might have an entire lifetime and career invested in my good life and the Lord may take every last bit of it from you and give you something else and you have the ability today to say amen amen so be it unto me Hallelujah that's a privilege you couldn't do that if it wasn't for the Holy Ghost you couldn't do that if you didn't have a gene of God down on the inside of you oh my so we so we find brother Brown goes on here he says you do have something and that is Your Surrender of your own will your own ideas to the will and idea of almighty God and it's finished you say is that all there is I've got an answer for that just ask me is that all there is ready is that all there is I want you to do it louder is that all there is that's all there is that's all there is just take his promise don't think of nothing else walk by it and God does the rest of it Moses could build that Tabernacle Solomon could build that Temple but God had to finish it see brother Branham talks about you know that uh he says new wine skins I'm gonna just have to find a pausing place here and pick it up next time but it just Thrills me because we we talk about brother REM goes on I'm not going to read it but he he talks about how that and you've heard it before you can't take you know put you can't put new wine in old wine skins because they burst because they're old and brutal they've already stretched as far as they can and now they're old and brittle and can't stretch and new wine ferments and expands and so it burst the old wine skin see and so so you have to have a new wine skin now watch this now because brother Branham says he says God does the rest of it he he starts talking about how that uh let me see if I can find it here yeah he says anything that you try to do within yourself it'll always work to your dishonor it'll work to your disadvantage just simply believe God and that settles it and here at the end time brother Branham says we meet the same thing again face to face we're talking about everybody's got to have a denomination everybody's got to have a work everybody's got to have this that or the other and he says we meet the same thing again face to face oh it's up to the Methodist the Baptist the Presbyterians and what more see you can't go on you've got to come back to the entire Full Gospel Paul talks about that Paul talks about that there is a a Grace that a special Grace that is to be released to you who are people of the end time and I'm not it's not an exact wording in the scripture but that's the essence of the teaching that you're to look for it that as we come to the end time you're to look for a Grace that is to be given now you only get there's only one of two things that that can be true about that either it's a Grace that's never been given which I immediately say um can't be because all the fullness of the godhead bodily was met in Jesus Christ and there's no Grace greater than the grace of Christ that he can give me so if it's not a Grace that's never been the only other alternative is it's a restoration of a Grace that had already been but a church went down Through the Ages and lost access to that full Grace that you're here in the end time and you've given a fresh access to do what he says here at the end time we meet the same thing again face to face up to the method as bad as Christians want more you can't go on you've got to come back to the entire Full Gospel listen it was made for the full Man by a complete God who was made flesh and dwelt Among Us I'm here to tell you something friends that it's not only that that if you'll notice what made a complete God did you hear what he said it was a full word by a full God and he goes the word was made flesh and dwelt in Christ I'm here to tell you that when this Grace comes at the end time and it's here it doesn't need to make Christ again it's here to make Mrs Jesus Christ it's here to make you the full word hallelujah to restore you back nothing behind me nothing upon me nothing within me I'm completely restored I've been brought back by the Full Gospel I'm here to tell you this Full Gospel is never going to be able to be contained in this old wine skin These Bars of bone are gonna burst wide open Hallelujah you can't contain me I'm going to have a new wine skin to house the glory that's inside of me oh friends are you you realize today are you grateful for what God has called you to that you have been called out of the world snatched from Satan's grasp he has no authority over you no hold over you nothing to say in my life no he runs nothing about my life my whole life is in the hands of almighty God and I'm being formed into the new image Hallelujah I'm bringing I'm being brought back but no complexes that bother me anymore no failures will bother me anymore no Fallen nature will bother me anymore I'm being brought back the third phase to restore the kingdom to its rightly position that fell by sin God bless you let's stand oh Hallelujah Amen brother can
