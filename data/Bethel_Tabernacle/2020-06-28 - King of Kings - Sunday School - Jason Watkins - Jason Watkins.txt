TRANSCRIPT
========================================
good morning let's stand happy again to be able to carry the Sunday school class two weekends in a row for me I really enjoy it and mean that quite sincerely brother Matt and ended up being in town this weekend but I told him since I was already in the slot I wasn't giving it up and so so he plus he has a service in the Middle afternoon for Arizona today so I'm just wanting to take this little lesson this morning if you got my memo that I sent out this morning we're going to take a title and preach our teacher class here this morning or lesson would be called King of Kings amen Tom is it yeah happy to have you here god bless you sister Jeanne invited her plumber Amen sister Jeanne she's quite the evangelist amen so she's never met a stranger and being that she's probably the friendliest person I know in the planet she has a way of witnessing a man that's really spectacular a man in Revelation chapter 1 want to read from revelation 1 we're gonna read verses 1 through 8 got some interesting things for you to think about today now you know me you know both you know both ends you know I'm gonna try to be staying a teaching gear you know I'm not good at it but you'll just you'll just be patient with me amen sometimes the word gets so delicious I can't stand it and I get into heaven and Jubilee over it and start preaching a man but it's a good meal it's a good diet seven course meal amen it's the bread of life you believe that in Revelation chapter one let's just get those first eight verses the revelation of Jesus Christ which God gave unto him to show unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass and he sent and signified it by his angel unto his servant John who bare record of the word of God and of the testimony of Jesus Christ and of all things that he saw blessed is he that readeth and they that hear the words of this prophecy and an amazing there's a blessing just in hearing it read and reading it or hearing it read and keep those things which are written therein for the time is at hand John to the seven churches which are in Asia grace be unto you and peace from him which is and which was and which is to come and from the seven spirits which are before his throne and from Jesus Christ who is the faithful witness and the first begotten of the Dead and the Prince of the kings of the earth unto him that loved us and washed us from our sins in his own blood and hath made us kings and priests unto God and his father to whom be glory and Dominion for ever and ever amen behold he cometh with clouds and every eye shall see him and they also which pierced him and all Kindred's of the earth shall wail because of him even so amen I am Alpha and Omega the beginning and the ending saith the LORD which is and which was and which is to come here's an important word the Almighty amen if you're the Almighty that means you're the most mighty amen let's pray father we thank you for your word this morning and there is indeed a blessing in the reading it and just hearing it read father but that blessing attaches to those who obey it Lord that's the finished part of that verse Lord that those who keep the sayings which are written therein so father we know we don't want to be merely here but we also want to be doers of all your word help us today be with my lips Lord keep me from misrepresenting your word in the slightest father we just want to lift you up today and teach this little lesson we commit it to you now in Jesus name Amen god bless you as you're seated a couple of quick things that I want you to notice right out of the gate is that when Jesus is returning there's a couple of things to notice it speaks of his return beginning in verse 7 and it describes it further in verse 8 he cometh with clouds and every eye shall see him so we realized then that this of course is the second coming of Christ at the end of the Tribulation Period because in this verse it describes how that every eye would see him and in fact is every eye that will see him and they also which pierced him you say well that's kind of a redundant statement the Jews saw him 2,000 years ago why does it mention it again because don't forget a prophet in this day linked that crucifixion and brought it into the modern day and indicted a generation of the earth to say you have once again crucified the Son of God afresh and so this will be the time when the systems of man religious political and what more will see him everyone will see him there will be no doubt that he is there will be no doubt who he is there will be no doubt what the truth was and and and it's and if you'll notice that that's not the rapture of the church at the before the tribulation because when the rapture of the church goes prior to the tribulation the Bible describes him as coming like a thief in the night no one sees it no one notices it he gathers his his elected takes him home the tribulation set and at the end of the tribulation is when all eyes shall see him and those that pierced him all Kindred's of the earth noticed this shall wail because of him so this is not going to be a party this is not going to be a jubilee this is going to be people wailing because of the sudden absolute reality that they have followed the god of this evil age and they weren't following in fact Jesus that they thought they were they were following another Jesus we'll get to that more in the open the main service and so he we find this description they shall all Kindred's of the earth shall wail it's either these are too loud or this is too loud I'm not sure brother Joe but cut maybe just the monitors down maybe that's all that's needed just seems like I'm in a well but but all the Kindred's of the earth shall wail now catch the language because of him not because of the tribulation they've endured 42 months of the unimaginable horrors of the tribulation period they're not wailing because of their pain or because of their circumstances or because the world is ending they're wailing because of him because when he appears then every eye shall see him and everyone shall know where they stand and then they shall understand that their destiny is not a good one now it's interesting when we talk about the time of the end of the world we we could you know we look at the signs of the world today and it's not lost on us I don't think it certainly shouldn't be that the things the calamities that are be falling the world that the world is is in a state of almost stupid fication over they every report is just it's unprecedented it's son you know it's it's there's no reference they don't know what's happening every news report is bad and as soon as we get a little bit of good news it comes back bad again I believe and maintain this belief until I'm shown otherwise that we're never going back to normal as we knew it the world cannot get better according to Bible prophecy it has to get worse it must get worse because Christ is coming to take his bride out and then the then the sudden you're talking about falling off a cliff I want you to imagine this for a moment that in the that you know we can talk about and go back over hundreds of years and centuries and multiple centuries and even millennia and and you can look down through multiple millennia two three four thousand years back through human history and you will always see that global crisis is a gradual oncoming it just gets worse it gets worse something bottoms out there's kind of a redoing a government passes away an empire passes away another power rises up things start again and these things go over decades and centuries and and many centuries and so you don't find you know the last time you find the earth suddenly coming to a a disastrous catastrophe was in the antediluvian world in the days of Noah you don't find that again from that time all the way down through history and if you can imagine now that when the when the elected Bride of Christ is taken from the earth and a secret catching away that in the space of a mere 42 months that's it the earth will go from fully functioning governments around the world civilize law commerce trade economies births deaths politics social issues religion the earth will go from from operating at full tilt on hitting on all eight cylinders and in the space of 42 months will come to a complete end you're talking about a precipitous fall that's almost uncharted you'd have to go back to the days of Noah to exceed what's going to happen to the earth and and so we find that you know these things that are happening today I'm not here to be the bearer of bad news I'm here to interpret modern events that are made clear to us by prophecy because knowing is half the battle and and and there's a there's a a peace and knowing there's a peace and you know it's when we say peace that passes understanding there is that that the Spirit of God gives us it gives us peace in our heart even in times of sorrow even in times of trouble but there's also a layer of of Shalom a layer of peace that comes upon us when God can reveal what you see happening in the word and you look at it and then you look at it and you go oh okay I see this is supposed to be happening okay y'all everybody calm down God's still in control there's a peace that comes with that and so I'm glad for modern events made clear in prophecy because the with the world you have the exact opposite the Bible prophesized that men's hearts and the last day would fail for fear and there is no greater anxiety or fear than a fear of the unknown just saw a documentary on that very thing where they were talking about that that's the greatest cause of fear and hysteria is when a calamitous event is occurring and no one knows what's happening or why it's happening and even and and they don't know what's going to happen and so this brings a great fear I'm glad today that I know what's happening I know why it's happening and I know what's going to happen say you can predict tomorrow with a 100% certainty say what's your prediction I'm in his hands hallelujah what's your prediction he's got his eye on me I know that he holds my life and he as David said my times are in his hands and I'm glad that it's that way you're looking at a man today friends with the madness of the world I'm glad I'm not making the decisions for my life I'm glad long ago I turned him over to the Alpha and the Omega who could see the end from the beginning there's an article that I read very recently from a professor at a university and he's gay he's garnered quite a bit of attention and in the academic world because of an almost uncanny predictions that he made a decade ago his name is Peter Turchin and he I'm not going to give you the bio on his life he's a university professor and at the University of Connecticut and today he's a 63 researcher who teaches cultural evolution at the University of Connecticut to give you that much and in and in 2010 he took a number of metrics and I don't want to do the whole breakdown today because it's not really what my whole class is about but I just want to drop it in as a note that he he made uh he made startling predictions that at the time in 2010 sounded fantastic that they were just it was too fantastic to believe he he was held even in derision and and yet his predictions have hit on the money and he predicted ten years ago based on multiple metrics that he was measuring historically and it was a complete scientific equation that that in that in or about 20/20 and he actually named 20/20 he said this nation would go into upheaval like we had not seen and he started talking about politics and and and he starts on my political tension he mentions racial tension he talks about finding you know monetary disparity you know between the haves and the have-nots he talked about so issues that we're not getting solved and and he looked back over history and he could see markers and he could see that that about every 50 years that we go through a cycle and he said we're gonna hit one in 2020 and it's interesting now that his colleagues are coming around going my goodness Pete you really hit that one on the head now his response to that is listen you you didn't understand me back then you all jumped on me and you know let me have it because you thought I was prophesying I wasn't prophesying I'm not a prophet I was predicting based on measurable metrics what I was giving you was hard science and and now he has no doubters because seeing is believing and and now here I'll give you this final thought here it's a whole article that you're welcome I'll share it too if you ever want to just let me know but he here's something that caught my attention that he says on top of everything that we that we see that it would need something to touch it off that he said there was such underlying tensions in a multiple multiple areas of human life in America especially but he talks about it being global even and he said there would need to be something a catalyst to touch it off like a powder keg and that ended up being Cove at 19 now the scientists can't predict that God has to allow that so you understand that that what we see happening historically in the present in the future are not based on the contrivances of man the best laid plans of mice and men mean nothing to God they don't mean that to God God has everything in prophecy it's going along exactly I'm here to tell you we're exactly where we're supposed to be God is doing exactly what he said he would do and there is a remedy for our lives who are believers who are receiving a blessing from reading his word hearing his word and doing his word keeping those things which are written therein he says here at the end of his art on top of all of the metrics that I measured he Sturgeon says the COBIT 19 pandemic has further worsened the well-being of large swathes of American population leading a leading driver of national instability and could make the public less likely to trust government institutions boy is that an understatement now listen to this here's his last scent here's his last phrase as millions of Americans remain jobless Turchin says there will be other triggers after this now here's a man and said that's coming a trigger that's gonna set the powder keg off and he's now saying there will be other triggers I can already see it in the same science there will be other triggers and he worries tensions these are his words not mine I'm not an alarmist I'm reading an academic paper to you his words are that there will be other triggers after this and as a scientist he worries that tensions may escalate all the way to a civil war he says here's his last statement unfortunately he says things are not as bad as they can be things are not as bad as they can be now these are the realities of where we live this is our life this is what we see happening so what's what what's what's a man to do what's a believer to do I'm here to tell you something friends I read you all the way down to verse 8 because verse 6 calls him verse 5 calls him the Prince of Kings that means he's the king of all Kings that all kings have a prince over them and they're sovereign over them is Jesus Christ and it doesn't matter whether they call themselves a prime minister a president a Chancellor doesn't matter what they want to call themselves if you can call them a tater you can call them whatever you want you can call them but-but-but doesn't matter because they have a king over them and that is the Prince of all the kings he is almighty and he is in control my first and before this is Robbie Zacharias I love this make sure we got good volume on it okay revolutions and counter-revolutions wealth accumulated and wealth disbursed Shakespeare has spoken of the rise and fall of great ones that Evan flow with the moon I look back upon my own fellow countrymen of England once upon a time dominating a quarter of the world most of them convinced in the words of what is still a popular song that the God who made the mighty shall make them mightier yet I've had a craze cracked Austrian announced to the world the establishment of a German Reich that would last a thousand years I've seen an Italian clown saying he was going to stop and restart the calendar with his own ascension to power I've seen a murderous Georgian brigand in the Kremlin acclaimed by the intellectual elite of the world as a wiser than Solomon more humane than Marcus Aurelius more enlightened than Ashoka I have seen America more wealthier and in terms of military weaponry more powerful than the rest of the world put together so that had the American people so desired they could have outdone a Caesar or an Alexander in the range and scale of their conquests all in one lifetime all in one lifetime all gone gone with in England part of a tiny island of the coast of Europe setting with dismemberment and even bankruptcy Hitler and Mussolini dead remembered only in infamy Stalin is a forbidden name in the regime he helped found them dominate for some three decades America is hunted by fears of running out of the precious lose that keeps a motorway is roaring and the smog settling with painful memories of a disastrous campaign in Vietnam and the victory of the Don Quixote eyes of the media as they charge the windmills of Watergate all in one lifetime all in one lifetime all gone with the wind behind the debris of the fallings of our solemn supermen and imperial diplomatists lies the gigantic figure of one person because of whom by whom in whom and through whom mankind may still survive the person of Jesus Christ now I want you to catch that because because Robby is saying my lifetime I witnessed the rise of these tyrants I saw them rise to power and make these fantastical claims and I in my lifetime has seen it go Gone with the Wind and yet he's also observed that in his lifetime one power has never ceased and that is the one supreme power of Jesus Christ now it's interesting about Jesus and we're talking about King of Kings we read about him in Revelation and how that there's many many many scriptures that prophesy of Jesus in the Old Testament alone I'm gonna give you some numbers gonna blow your mind so really buckle up you ready in the Old Testament alone just the Old Testament Jesus Christ fulfilled more than 40 major prophecies concerning him in the Old Testament there's actually around 300 prophecies that are related related to him in some in some way he in his just in his earthly pilgrimage on his ministry he fulfilled more than 40 of them direct now that's a number watch this now so when we talk about Jesus fulfilling all of those prophecies the odds now watch this the odds of a single person fulfilling just eight of those prophecies the odds of one man fulfilling eight because the book was written over many years by many different people and the odds of a single individual fulfilling merely eight of them is it's a number I've started to put it up here but it's got a lot of zeros it's basically this 1 million trillion to 1 the odds of one man fulfilling merely eight is a million trillion to one and he fulfilled more than 40 of them people don't even understand what a million trillion is let me just let me just break down million billion trillion all right if I said to you today if I said to my son Chris I said Chris I want you to sit in that seat for a million seconds million seconds Chris Chris would say okay million seconds that's pretty fast one two three I mean what am I gonna what could it take few hours how about twelve days a million seconds is 12 days now what about a billion seconds I know what you're thinking before I read and I thought the same as you I thought well if a million seconds wow I was shocked it's 12 days I forgot a few hours okay so it's 12 days well then a billion let's let's dump let's triple it let's triple it and add some let's just call it 50 let's call it 50 days if a million seconds was 12 days a billion seconds I'm sure if I triple it and then add some more fur for just for safety then I'll be sitting there 50 days try 31 years now Jesus fulfilled not eight and it would to fulfill eight would make it a million trillion to one a million trillions we haven't even touched trillion yet so you say okay if million seconds is 12 days then you can sit there still for 12 days Chris you sure couldn't sit there for 31 years if I asked you to sit there for a billion seconds so I need you to sit there for a trillion seconds Chris okay so let's just really reach out there this time I'm not gonna get fooled I'm gonna go ahead man if a billion was 31 years I'm gonna double it I'm gonna triple it I'm gonna Quadra let's just go all the way out there and let's call it 200 years try 31 centuries that's math for you a million seconds is 12 days a billion seconds is 31 years a trillion seconds is 30 1688 years that is more than five times longer than the human history since Adam in the Garden of Eden more than five times since the days of Adam five times and that's one trillion for one man to fulfill eight Old Testament prophecies would be a would be a million trillion to one I'm here to tell you something you're King of Kings has earned his title you're king of kings in fulfilling 40 more than 40 Old Testament prophecies I'm here to take some friends you don't need to worry a prince is in control we don't need to fear that somehow this thing's gonna spiral out of control and forensics in forensics DNA evidence will convict a person of a crime based on one in six billion basically out of all the people on the earth the evidence points only to one person that's one in six billion and and that don't even touch a trillion and we're not even going to speak about a thousand trillion or 10,000 trillion or a hundred thousand tree and how about a million trillion and Jesus only fulfilling eight of would hit that heath fulfilled more than 40 I'm here to take something friends let the earth rock and real I've got a prince on the throne I've got one who has who is so overwhelmingly proven to you that I told my wife today I said if I don't accomplish anything else in my Sunday School class we should be able to dispel anxiety over what's happening out there in the world say what's the government gonna do I don't know it don't matter he's in control what's gonna happen to my life tomorrow what about this circumstance and what about that circumstance and I got this and thing and I got that thing he's in control somebody who fulfilled for the Old Testament I mean I don't even know what the number would be to say how could that even happen I'm here to taste something friends he is in control that's why he said now my last thing before I close I got two minutes really two minutes three minutes over but we allow five minutes for fudge verse six says and hath made us kings and priests unto God and his father to him be glory and Dominion for ever and ever amen this same one who blew a million trillion to one out of the water has made you kings and priests with him brother Branham says when a man or woman is dressed in the full armor of God it ain't power its authority from on high when he says Devils will scream and brakes will squeal squeak even death itself will shudder and graves will open at the authority that Jesus Christ gave his church all men knows this these signs shall follow them that believe and brother Branham says lift up the authority the inside I'll tell you something friends if you've got Christ in your heart now how do you think about greater is He that is in me than he that is in the world I always thought a lot about that song I love to the lyrics greater is he that I don't know what this as I don't care greater is He that send me the he's in the world that has taken a whole new meaning in my life greater you you can't even describe what authority and what power Christ has in intricate control over this world he is the prince of kings god bless you god bless you god bless you we'll have a short intermission and the regular service will begin shortly go Lord we thank you for your word continue to bless us now Lord bless the song service coming the worship service bless the muse musicians and worship leader Lord may it be a banner day for us to worship you in spirit and in truth we commit it to you in Jesus name Amen 5 or 7 or 8 minute intermission we'll be starting right back up again you godless
