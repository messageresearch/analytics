we're just looking forward to the word and everything I don't see hey we're just carrying on it's all we know to do you know we're just doing our best to try to keep up for testimony so we operate this best hood we just talked about it yesterday at the ministers meeting you know if this was they were asking us to stop preaching that ain't gonna happen they were asked us to compromise the word that ain't gonna happen but hey this ain't bad so we'll just carry on kind of a breaking out hopefully you know summertime all kind of see it debate enough to where we full assembly meetings and then I know for sure that we're gonna have a meeting in the air and hang on behalf of us and ain't gonna be the book of life from beta J and then k to Z it's gonna be the book of life from A to Z and letters we don't even have a man praise the name of Lord that heavenly book my what names what secrets what great things how many were there to take already been over thirty minutes and I'm already getting feedback from different people so we want a Greek by the Thames assembly today the Assembly of Bible Christians we're in Tennessee Manchester see the Assembly of Bible Christians god bless you amen everybody turn away with the camera say god bless your saints praise the Lord and man we're happy to have them here amen they're following their pastor today and he's in simply blessed [Music] be the name of the Lord again and we'll invite the preacher to come over to the platform this time I don't think I have any other announcements amen blessed be the name [Music] hey Wow praise the Lord and wonderful atmosphere at number the Jason was just gonna get going and I was just gonna sneak in the back and sit with my family but you know you've arrived when the pastor's fine sitting with his wife and he doesn't need to give you visual cues behind the preach like don't think man so I'll trust that you're still gonna go down there now but you might it might have changed his mind let's just take her Bibles that turn to second Corinthians chapter 10 very happy to be here together with you today and considered a great honor yesterday's ministers meeting was tremendous for myself personally I told brother Tim I felt just for myself that the trajectory of the men's meet the ministers meetings and what they had been doing over these many years just Lord knew that I would intersect at this juncture and it was just perfect for where I'm at in my life I'm very very grateful for it and the different ones that supported it I considered a great honor again to be here in fellowship with you today and we've expressed before just how much we appreciate the ministry here brother Jason and sister Debbie have just been very very good friends to sister Elizabeth and I have been instrumental and the Lord leading us and guiding us you have tremendous ministry here in the church and even if I think about brother Dale the Lord used him in my life appreciate his ministry and then now that he's pastoring in Arizona I think it's just a compliment to to the church here and then the Jason de maras ministry I've enjoyed his friendship ministry and then I think I'm on hold with brother Matthew still right now in the office but his friendship and ministry I just think of my God's really blessed this assembly with wonderful ministry and myself personally I've been benefited not only by the ministry but the friendships and so I just I want to just express that if I haven't said it before how much we love you and we've appreciated the gifts and your assembly and the friendships that they've been to us so I wanted to say that this time since we had another chance to do it and we love you and thank you for the opportunity to be here second Corinthians chapter 10 verses 4 & 5 we know that the book of Corinthians both books are books correction and Paul is having to deal with a lot of carnality in the church and in verses 4 and 5 year of 2nd Corinthians chapter 10 it says for the weapons of our warfare are not carnal but mighty through God to the pulling down of strongholds and I believe this is so instructive to this church that was operating largely in the flesh and carnally casting down imaginations and every high thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ if we could just bow our heads in prayer gracious Heavenly Father thank you for the privilege we have of being assembled in this sanctuary Lord a mindful of those in the alphabet who just by just by prudence and wisdom the the church here has agreed the pastor together with those that labor with them and the assistant pastor that Labor's with you Lord made the decision to divide it among the alphabet Lord we just pray for those of this assembly who aren't here that where they are you could just come to them Lord in and and make them feel a part of this for we know that this the separation this distance is difficult Lord and preaching here I know that there's Arizona believers streaming in father that that are hungry for the word of God and and desirous to have you speak to them so Lord we just pray that wherever they may be Lord wherever they might be right now we just pray that they would feel a part of this service law part of the larger body of Christ if not the Assembly hear and speak to them from your word for the time that we're living in we commit all thanks to you now and ask this in the name of Lord Jesus Christ amen and you may be seated yeah I got the my title is emotional faith and before you assume we're where I'm going with this subject or you think wow if he's preaching on emotional faith this is where he's going to end up I'd like you to broaden broaden your expectations a little bit because I plan on going there and everywhere else too and just try to be right down the middle of the road in this subject and emotional faith is the title but I'm also wanting to make intellectual faith akin to emotional faith and I'd like you to see that connection as we go forward because I'm speaking about emotional faith and I think that we ought to connect intellectual faith as well to emotional faith and it's a broad subject but I want to approach it in a way to encourage genuine faith in Christ just to reassure you about the faith that you have in the word of the Lord how God confirms that faith and just how we are this is a walk of faith if God has birthed his church in faith and going to and then one day is gonna take her off the earth it's going to be faith that's why brother BAM said the rapture is a revelation and he also said the new birth is a revelation and we know faith is a revelation so if you begin in faith and this ends in faith then God's not gonna abandon the principle of faith to get us out of here and in intellectual faith I want to start perhaps with just defining this because I think we have maybe their own ideas when it comes to emotional faith but if we were to define intellectual faith it resides within the human emotions and that's why I want to make them synonymous intellectual faith and emotional faith it this kind of faith resides in our human emotions it's a faith that's more related to our human spirit and our minds as opposed to genuine faith which resides and is anchored in our soul so being we being soul spirit body there can be an intellectual and emotional faith that is in that spirit realm of the man and maybe even just in the physical sense something is transpiring that the spirit the spirit of a man identifies with and that gives him some sort of confidence and that would be the intellectual emotional faith we're talking about but genuine faith from God anchors in the soul and it's actually independent of any sort of sensation or emotion that a person may be having in their spirit or in their body there's times that you have to go by faith apart from what your affection is telling you your memories telling your imagination is telling you all those different things you know and faith anchors in your heart it's apart from all those other things and so intellectual faith emotional faith is both dead and formal on one side but then also emotional and seemingly fanatical on another and so we often maybe just pin one on intellectual faith it's just all cold and formal but intellectual faith can be dead and formal on one hand but it also can be very expressive and energetic on another hand and so intellectual faith will manufacture either emotionalism or formalism it's not that it only tends to one it'll do both intellectual faith will manufacture emotionalism where there's a lot of sensation a lot of expression but that it can also manufacture formalism where there's a restraint or a barrier to expression but genuine faith produces expressive emotions and then also a quietness of stillness and a confidence in genuine faith it can produce expressive worship genuine faith can produce a signs and wonders that might be in terms of gifts and and manifestations but then it can also bring a real steady reverence and a resolve and a quietness to somebody but how that faith is working is from the inside out and I want to just add this as we begin I'm not preaching against the against emotional faith and certainly not preaching against emotions because we are emotional beings and to preach against emotions would just be the pre preach against the very way that God made man and the and the very fact that we that there's fruits of the Spirit and if you look at the fruits of the spirit they're connected with human emotions and so if we try to take emotion out of the gospel emotion about our experience and we're actually just trying to make us non-human but what's important is to understand that our emotions must align with the word and that's maybe more what I'm looking at is just trying to pull from different to show that we must be aligned in the word and if we're in the word and under the word then that's the proper channel that our emotions can be expressed because there's gonna be times when you're gonna have disappointments and and sadness and emotions of discouragement and it's okay to have those emotions because God will actually use those emotions to deal with you that the feeling the feeling of godly sorrow it's an emotion leads one to repentance so without even the feeling of sorrow you could not appropriately repent and God will even use regret to cause you to moderate behavior and he'll deal with us in our emotional realm but he does it not that we may remain emotional or become subject to the emotions but identify that God is wanting to lead us by dealing with us in that realm to bring ourselves subject to the Word of God and there'll be times in your lives when you experience great loss and hardship and sorrow estrangement from family and you can't bury that emotion and say there's nothing to it we know it's very very real very very raw and it can be very visceral the way we want to express it but what we must do is make those emotions subject to the word now brother branham makes this statement and earnestly contending for the faith he says Paul was down here in the natural realm with his PhD he had an intellectual faith but he didn't have a divine faith there's quite a difference in me having an intellectual faith than a divine faith there's where you he says my Baptist friends fail to go on so he's identified if we look at that theological II that the Baptist are really good at believing but they they put a period on it and they remain in that realm of intellectual assent or acknowledgement of truth he says you get the intellectual faith by that but it must be a divine revelation of Jesus Christ to you that just come out of the heart intellectual faith is not enough not to say it's not enough means it is something but it's not sufficient it's good to have but you want more that's alright but it only brings you to the Holy Spirit the Holy Spirit is a personal experience of the birth the new birth regeneration making a new creature in Christ so you can believe but there must be a going on and I realize this is very very basic and fundamental to you and as I've said before it's not a cheap trick to try to get a lot of amens it's just to kind of walk you through these things so you know where I'm beginning to know where I'm going so I said you can have intellectual faith it brings you to the door of the Holy Ghost so to speak it brings you to that place of surrender but there must be a greater surrender and a yielding to then come to the birth of the baptism of the Holy Ghost and so he's saying that's what you come the Holy Ghost is a personal experience of the new birth it's a personal revelation of Jesus Christ to you so intellectually believing the message does not give you a Holy Ghost experience no matter how convinced you are about the message and you may not reason with it you may not argue with that you may not ever debate it you may be absolutely convinced of it but that in itself is not a personal experience of the new birth I realize this can kind of get turned around on us so we get a little bit confused because there's only one evidence of the baptism of the Holy Ghost and that's to have a clear understanding and there's only one evidence of the Holy Ghost and that's the believe the word for your day there's no other evidences of it no other sensations emotions or anything else but you have to realize that just that might seem to be a little bit of a paradox but what what must be understood is there must be an anchor of a personal experience with the word that this intellectual faith has brought you to where in you our birth into the body of Christ you become a new creature in Christ Jesus your soul and God locked together and you become one and no matter what you go through in life your ups and downs and your different standings and no matter how shell-shocked you get there's a part of you that can say I know I've met him face to face and you know where you're standing just as Paul instructed those that he came in contact with in Acts chapter 19 he said have you received the Holy Ghost since you believed and he's asking this question because he says it well he's asking them about the Holy Ghost cuz that's the promise of the day and you knew they were believers but he won to know if they had received the Holy Ghost since they believed and they say well we have not even so much have heard as whether there was a Holy Ghost so then he's thinking well how have you been taught but to what we had you've been baptized too because he understood that the problem even now brother Branham told us that if you don't have the Holy Ghost he says I'm not scolding your friends but God's obligated to give you the Holy Ghost as soon as you've obeyed his word in repentance and baptism and the name of Lord Jesus Christ he says you're either mist taught you don't understand or something's wrong somewhere because God's obligated to give it to you so here Paul begins to look at how they were taught and they were not taught appropriately so he then appropriate that faith and takes that intellectual faith that they had and then brings the revealed word of that day and then that faith dropped down into a revelation and they're baptized they received the Holy Ghost and are baptized correctly and so this is a pattern we see in the scripture something brother branham amplifies quite a bit through his ministry it's not just believing but it's receiving the Holy Ghost as a confirmation of that faith the genuine experience of the new birth is the seal of your faith that is what that is what brings the seal is your faith listen no matter how how you want to cherry-pick from the message brother Branham is very clear on this the baptism of the Holy Ghost which is the new birth is the seal of your faith he's not sealing your good works she's not sealing the fact that you sanctified yourself he's not sealing the fact that she erased your Spotify playlist and he's not he's not he's not he's not sealing the fact that you deleted Netflix from your iPad he's sealing your faith in God seal in your faith in the word and this cannot be substituted it cannot be substituted it cannot be substituted through through apologetics to where we have everything outlined in the message every T crossed every I dotted everything just wrapped up very perfectly even his brother Jason was mentioning yesterday just some kind of unifying theory to everything where it all makes sense and you go I approve I second that motion you've got to have a new birth experience and that Pentecostal experience which was instituted into the body of Christ and birthed the body of Christ on the day of Pentecost the very moment that God brought that Pentecostal experience that experience has been a part of every single bride members life from the beginning brother Bram said every age is the age of the Holy Ghost for the believer and so every individual regardless of what the dispensation was tight as every individual has had to have a Pentecostal experience in order to be a part of that body and the Pentecostal experience is based upon the Word of God in nothing else when this Pentecostal outpouring happened in the book of Acts it was it was an experience with the word it was according to the word they have to understand that those that and even when we talk about those that in the Pentecostal organizations today they're trying to somehow repeat what happened in approximate and simulate what took place in the book of Acts but yet they're not recognizing that when they went to the upper room they were doing it according to the revealed word of that day the the climax of the ministry of Jesus Christ was a hundred and twenty people in an upper room scared to death but under a commandment that the Holy Ghost would come and when that happened that brought forth the new body the of the Jesus Christ it birthed the church and then from then on that experience is for as many as the Lord our God would call and that experience has continued even in the age that we live in now but we realize now that the revealed word of the hour is not pointing us to an upper room experience but pointing us to a meeting in the air and at the very climax of the Christ in this day is it is to take a body change and to be translated so with this experience it cannot be based upon intellect it cannot be based upon emotions upon sensations or any kind of feelings and we cannot have bring to bring any other evidence in view and I was and I I feel like as believers we've really maybe we've moved on a little bit from kovat 19 and the sense that we're not worried about it and we probably should have never been to be we shouldn't have been to begin with I have caught maybe a personal revelation about what the 19 is in kovat 19 its the 19 pounds I gained and I'm just thanking God they didn't name it the Cova 30 but and I share this knowing that no doubt that these things have been ministered on because it was necessary for ministry to address these things that were taking place at the time they're in March and April and even into May with these things but there were different ones who took this attitude based upon certain things that brother banner had said that if you have the Holy Ghost don't worry about getting coronavirus and it might have been the intent of it might have been to create a faith to say hey don't worry bride you're gonna be okay brother BAM said those with the Holy Ghost don't have to worry about these diseases coming but you realize what you have done is you've arbitrarily and humanistically created a false evidence of the Holy Ghost and in doing so you only weaken the faith of a genuine sealed believer because now they're presented with another evidence that will actually confirm whether or not they have it so instead of being certain according to the word by faith that they have it because they've received the word for their day and are walking in it now it's like well now the real test is coming and it's gonna be proven by a you know cotton swab being shoved up your nose or an antibody test no there was there is no truth to that thought that those with the Holy Ghost will not get coronavirus because that becomes another evidence of the Holy Ghost and we only have one evidence of the Holy Ghost there is one disease that the bride is among mune - spiritual death she is immune to deception she's immune to being deceived that's the disease that has fallen upon all the world that the bride is immune to alone that's the last plague that hits the earth that proves between electone Ani lek that the world would know that I the LORD have put a difference between the bride laodicea she will not be to see now ever I have a lengthy quote to be a part of this lengthy sermon but you all are pulling so well today my my goodness if if we were if we were just if we were digging rardy just really really deep here and so once you get halfway you just got to go all the way all the way through to the other side in Satan's Ino try to read this quickly it's lengthy but follow how brother branham attracting this I heard brother Neville say this morning someone might have been asking him why I didn't preach on the Holy Ghost why didn't I do this here it is now based upon what he says here and I'm just inject I don't like maybe I don't like to express my own thoughts but let me share it for myself personally and you can allow the Lord to deal with you but as I read this you realize there had to be some impression in the person's mind about what the Holy Ghost would look like and why brother Branham wasn't preaching on it and as he answers that you realize that they probably were coming from the viewpoint of why don't we see more manifestations of gifts why don't we see more enthusiasm why don't we see more excitement I mean brother Branham when he preaches he never has to tell the people to be seated but brother Browns preaching it's not a bunch of shouting going crazy and people running on his prayer lines are not not the way that they were thinking they should be the way these other charismatic guys were doing them and brother Craig Brewer pointed out to me one time he said brother Aaron it strikes me I hope he's okay with me sharing this and he said it just strikes me we don't do our prayer lines like brother Branham did him the reverence that was there and the faith that was evident and he was just expressing this from his heart and I imagine that in some ways that was kind of what brother Brad was being asked about is hey how come there's not just more of these manifestations and brother ban says here it is the holy ghost is the action in you it's a life not an emotion and that's why I feel that brother Branham this question was asked to brother Brandon why don't you preach preach on the Holy Ghost they were looking for emotions in the outside realm and brother BAE I'm saying it's not an emotion it's an action in you not some sort of fleshly evidence but it is a person Jesus Christ the word established in your heart to quicken every word of this age Amen I want to know what the word is for this age now I think we I want all the word but I definitely want all the word for this age that's because what's promised for this age that maybe other ages didn't have I want you to be cooking for this age he says right watch the Holy Ghost in action not so much in demonstrations outward emotions outward expressions but in action what it does according to the word so it's what it does according to the word that's the Holy Ghost in action so we look at the word and the word says it then we believe it and then we want the word made manifest not so much in things that may be expressive or demonstrative but what it does according to the word and then he backs up to show in addressing this why does it brother been a preach on the Holy on the Holy Ghost and as he expresses this he says now notice the Holy Spirit of God's holy word had a man and a woman naked and didn't know it how beautiful life of the word the seed the word God said there's a tree in the midst of the garden the woman in the midst of the garden is this tree don't haven't even touch it for the day you eat thereof that day you died they were wholly veiled from him didn't know nothing about it darris to touch it they were wholly veiled they were safe in god's pavilion they were alive i had somebody tell me one time they said they were they were they said now god's always been high hid behind a hole lavell I said thank God he's been unveiled in this hour he said they were alive died had no death around them hallelujah they had perfect love for it the other perfect life forever they had perfect love perfect understanding of the love of God they had God's Word and kept it they were alive and safe in God's Eden with no death at all all around them then Satan got Eve to listen to his gospel of theology the gospel of knowledge higher school in higher ethics better civilization higher education and so forth then he got her to stop and listen to him a minute to his reasonings now brother branham is trying to identify that this was the basis this was the basis for her acting and heard and in responding it was it was through reasonings that caused her to act it was reasoning that caused her to disbelieve and he's giving us this example by introducing it with this question why doesn't brother Branham preach the Holy Ghost why didn't I do this why don't I do that and he says because it's not emotion so they're looking for emotion Brother Bear says it's not emotion it's the word and then he says in the beginning Satan used reasoning and intellect to deceive Eve so he's connecting emotions with intellect he says which we are he says he got her to stop a minute to listen to him to his reasonings and so the reasonings appeals to the flesh something that feels good to the flesh it seems reasonable it's something that the flesh a sense to so it's good there's going to be some Accord or satisfaction within your flesh that that makes you think that makes sense so if there's some dissonance if there's some disagreement if there's some way that your spirit wouldn't agree with it then it's not reasonable but through reasons it can actually cause even your emotions and your human emotions to accept what's being said and it's not faith it's all built in an emotional realm so it talks about reasoning don't divorce that from your emotions because some people can be very staid very stoic very reasonable very logical and their approach to things and that's not so much being emotional but rather they're using this knowledge or logic to bring their motions and subject to their reasoning but then somebody who has no logic they might just react in passion and they react just how they're feeling and want to do things and it may be a little bit chaotic but they're both exist within the same intellectual human spirit realm when he got her to listen he says now looky here the church is so-and-so it's been established for so long we're one of the oldest churches in the country brother Branham just certainly Satan didn't say that then right but he's the same old devil now in this age saying this very thing he says he's saying though oldest churches in the country the mayor the city goes he goes I don't care what it is if it's against God's Word be against it that's your enemy anything that against the word is your enemy everything that's for the word is your brother and we can get real legalistic on this and say if they deny the word they're not your brother but the Bible says love your enemies do good to those who who hates you despitefully use you so they shouldn't be able to tell the difference so it doesn't change how we treat them it just changes our understanding so everything that's for the word is your brother he's a part of you notice he pulled off the holy veil to see what sex really was compare that what lust really would do so now the results of this intellectual reasoning is now being expressed in a physical realm and feelings and sensations so he's just walking us right through this process she pulled the veil from off her eyes and that the holy thing that God had put over her eyes she wanted knowledge to know what it was all about so he pulled the veil off to see what it was all about she listened to the devil and noticed what a place it put her in because now through intellect there's passion there's excitement there's there's feeling there's emotion there's sensation he says she listened to the devil and notice what a place that put her in they'll they have done the same in each age thereafter always taking the intellectual side and has now built a kingdom of Satan knowledge his seed that he sowed and has took the world to be an Eden of death the intellectual side always appeals to human emotions regardless of how it might express itself it is rooted in human emotion therefore it can be subject to human passion to lust to perversion it can be subject to feelings of it can actually be subject to to a lack of emotion and hardness and rigidity and a formalism but reasoning lead to lust because it's rooted in the flesh and often intellectual faith is viewed as being without emotion viewed as being dry and having no outward expression but that's not true the intellectual side has a cult has a has a cold formal confession in one sense but also emotional sensations in another it has it can be called informal it can also be a energetic and exciting and emotional but neither way is right in the channel or can be outside the channel but mmm says and I have heard but now I see says no selfish thing will work your motive and objective has to be exactly perfectly right then you have faith to ask if our hearts condemn us not then we have confidence see we've got to have confidence I want this to be the honor and glory of God then faith has a channel to move into he says if it doesn't then you've got mental intellectual faith in not genuine faith from God the that intellectual faith will get you nowhere now we can and we can rightly teach the intellectual faith it is reserved that it doesn't move it uh it's formal it doesn't have life it'll never lead you to a birth and it can be characterized like maybe in a sense like the Baptist you know they just believe and that's it and there's no there's nothing that follows and you're right you can be right to deduce that in and and the word could discern that in and correctly give the diagnosis that's the problem but brother Branham is going to show that how this relationship works he's saying that you want to have faith and you want faith to move into this right channel where you're more of an objective is right he says he says if you got mental intellectual faith and not genuine faith it'll get you nowhere then he says it might get you emotional but it won't get you the healing that you're looking for so intellectual faith can bring emotions it can bring enthusiasm it can bring sensations but it won't bring you the feeling and that's that's brother branham connecting now this intellectual faith in this mental faith with emotional faith and God keeps his word he says now just a moment everyone be reverent don't move stand still pray with all your heart this is very you know he's trying to get the people revered to let the angel of the Lord come and there could be manifestations of healing he says don't be emotionally have faith so don't be emotional have faith your emotions will never build and and if I could finish the sentence form if I could fill in the blank I would say your motions will never build the right kind of faith that your emotions will never build you to a place of healing it'll never build confidence to receive your healing he says it'll build a material intellectual faith but it'll never build faith in your heart so says your emotions will never build faith in your heart but emotions can build intellectual faith in your mind emotions could do them so in one hand he's saying that intellectual faith might get you emotional now he's saying emotional motions can get you intellectual faith he says it'll never build faith in your heart let the words sink down just believe God if you can believe all things are possible so emotions build intellectual faith because you're placing your confidence in your emotions or your emotional expression he say well I feel good that I must have it I feel good so something must be happening and there could be this thought of uh well I'm placed in my confidence in the fact that things are feeling different or you're placing your confidence in some outburst or expression and all too many times and far too many times there's been people experienced I'm sort of refreshing and reviving as the Holy Spirit is being poured out and they feel this expression and they blow out all the steam and it makes them feel really good but they stop there and never go on to a birth and I feel well what how could you explain being slain in the spirit how could you explain running around how could you explain this how could you explain that so well that was the outpouring of the Holy Ghost my goodness let's be careful that when the when something's moving that we don't just always say well that was just some sort of a carnal that was just the Antichrist a devilish spirit moving through no God God pours out his spirit upon all flesh and so there's a there's a rejoicing there's praise there's shoutings and people get caught up in it and then they go outside that realm like man I felt like I had the baptism of the Holy Ghost brother man says yeah you can have every day of your life and still be lost and go to hell because you're saying this emotion it doesn't build the right kind of faith because it obscures things that deviates you and some of you just taking him at his word that the devil can pervert for every fruit of the Spirit the devil has a perversion of it that can be a negative perversion with gentleness which is being the ability to rejoice when someone else is blessed you could have it you can have jealousy and then so the devil can pervert those emotions but then he can also impersonate any fruit of the Spirit now would you be able to say amen to that raise your hand that that's brother Branham that teaches out the devil can impersonate every single one of the fruits of the spirit I'm so emotions only build an intellectual faith an intellectual faith can only build emotions but genuine faith is in the word and by the word genuine faith is connected with the word and the word builds faith faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the Word of God Paul writes in Romans 10:17 faith genuine faith comes by hearing and hearing by the Word of God brother man says faith is not mythical something mentally worked up it's an absolutely fundamental result that happens in a person's heart when faith is appropriated then it's something in the person's heart but it can't be based on say well go touch a tree and you'll get well pray to the PO he says it's got to have a foundation now here it is I want you to get it how much more foundation could you place your faith on any level than the Word of God what more could you put faith in faiths final resting place is on the Word of God we realize without faith it is impossible to please God for he that cometh to God must first believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek Him so if you want to seek God you have to do it by faith if you're gonna find them and when you find them you have to also believe you'll be rewarded by him and all of that happens by faith apart from any other evidence you can't say God I believe you'll bless me when you bless me I'm gonna believe that it's so when it's so no that's why when they say seeing is believing well that's the intellectual side that's the carnal side but faith is actually an evidence of the unseen and that's where God is wanting to bring his bride in this last days is to believe him absolutely apart from sight apart from sensation apart from anything fleshly or carnal generalize that to the Jews he had to reveal himself in flesh as a physical Messiah but to the bride it's not a physical union but an invisible union and that the Gentile bride receives a messiah absolutely and totally by faith without sight without hands touching flesh and she doesn't doubt it and she's actually telling people that she's been invisibly United with the present Jesus Christ without seeing thorn Prince without seeing nail scars but she believes the revelation of the Son of Man has United the word to the bride in this hour [Applause] that's the bride's faith that's what he wants us to walk in and so faith is not mythical it's something not mentally worked up it's absolutely a fundamental result in a person's heart faith is an evidence let me encourage you today if you have any fear in your heart just know this fear is no evidence that's where faith fear lies to you you give in to the fear your fear can create it'll bring the thing bring the very thing you're fearing and the only reason why it does that now just bear with me as you ponder this the only reason why it does that is because you let your faith operate it how else can fear how else can the very thing job fear come upon him unless job took this righteous faith and placed it on the wrong thing and when we miss appropriate our faith and we put it on the wrong thing it can actually bring materialize the things that we fear but not because fear has that kind of power but because your faith isn't placed right fear is no evidence if you're believing for your healing today and your symptoms have you worried look at your symptoms and say I may be worried I may be scared but let me tell you something you're no evidence of unbel unbelief because I believe lord I believe help my unbelief your no evidence that I'm not going to be healed your no evidence that I'm gonna be a failure your no evidence that God's Word isn't true my fear is no evidence even though I may acknowledge it I'm bringing it subject to the promise and say fear you may be real but you're not greater than the power of God inside of it you're not greater than he who's given the promise so you could take this principle of faith being connected with the word and I now express this and believe it was when the Lord dealt with my heart about fear that this whole subject opened up to me then I was I was amazed at how powerful fear was and I realized that we can feed our fears and just listen just by looking at the Cova 19 graphs and tweets that go out and browsing Reddit and all these social media thing listen I think Facebook's done more to feed fear than it has been to connect us with their classmates in our and our colleagues in our family because the things we read the things were digesting you wonder why you're nervous you wonder why you're scared you wonder why you're tore up mentally and you wonder why some of the health things that we succumb to it's because what our emotions are being battered by all these things we're feeding on the things in the world we'll build a fear it grows increases your fear the the word increases your faith change your diet and things will change and so we must feed our faith and you can apply this principle to anything you can do it to salvation acts 2:38 put your faith right on that you can do it to healing by His stripes I'm healed appropriate your faith just Isaiah 53 you can do it by healing to look at the James chapter 5 the prayer of faith Colio is the prayer faith shall save the sick you're placing it on the word yeah you're not even you're not even thinking well my who could I have pray for him if we could just get brother Qadri here and he can lay hands on me her brother jeweller oh my brother Jason do you think you could get brother Ron Spencer here the God is honored his faithfulness and his gift and the dynamic power that's followed and can you bring him here so that I can receive a healing just like he did when she he laid his hands on her when he did this for them and all these great things and you notice your faith is on the things that have been done and not the promise that did it and you want you want a dynamic man of God like brother Qadri to come to lay hands on you but if you've taken your faith and you've based upon an instance where a person was healed by his hands that have you caught the revelation that he was only doing it according to the word and that's what will do it for you brother Branham preached the meeting I believe it was in Kansas and there was a man who had been crushed by her in an accident he said all God would just give me a vision to go lay hands on him he'd come out of that hospital and be well and the Lord spoke to him said the same faith that you put in that vision to lay your hands on him is the same faith you use when you lay your hands on them without a vision and that's the place that God wants his bride to walk in not where we need the vision not where we need the sensation not where we need the Builder but God said it that settles it [Applause] and we direct our faith to the word take God at His Word don't reason it out I believe God's my healer while you were in the kitchen I by His stripes I'm here when it's been don't don't want to hear it no matter what they say well you realize this runs in your family yeah that's why that's why I needed a new birth genetics doesn't have the final say family history doesn't have the final say listen can we just settle the argument death doesn't even have the final say why because a blind man could testify and say hey man I was blind and I got healed I really encourage you and in another person you say well I was lame and now I could walk and and all these different people could testify but then they could actually look at the situation in your zit and I don't know that's a rough one how long have you had it how difficult is it - it looks too bad and I'm just so glad that brother Rodney Griffin wrote the song for greater vision said that Lazarus stepped forward and said excuse me a moment can I testify you just take comfort from Lazarus testimony listen no matter how far gone you think it is no matter how far out there your children are no matter how broken your marriage is no matter how bad your finances are no matter how bleak the situation looks let Lazarus testify there's no situation too far gone for this my faith in God's Word take God at His Word believe them for the impossible now I want to just go further than this I'm having a good time is it alright if you're just here for my fun my goodness I'm enjoying myself if we if we begin just to dissect this further there's a difference between being rational and rationalizing and so when we don't reason it out that doesn't mean we don't have some reason and that we have a godly reasoning that we have we have something in our minds that is a that is aligned with reason because there's a what we acted in faith may seem unreasonable to the world but it seems absolutely reasonable to us as Christians so we're not operating without reason we're not app operating without an understanding and so we're not being we're not rationalizing babari being rational according to the word we're being a if it's scriptural logic so to speak it's a it's a godly reasoning and so we want to approach the word rationally we don't need to amend it with our emotions we don't need to supplement it when God says if we believe this Bible to be true and we were convinced of it if God for some reason aloud allowed the bride to go a stretch let's just say we're just being we're just hypothetically speaking if we allowed the entire body of Christ to go ten years without one miracle it wouldn't change the truth and so God's Word can be believed without evidence God's Word can be believed without substance up lament but thank God he's given us precedent he hasn't left us without precedent but the precedent is connected with the word when a brother testifies God's done this and someone else testifies God than that that gives you faith to believe that that word that God confirms his word he backs it up but I could say we're in the absence of precedent our faith can believe God's Word absolutely because we approached it rationally in understanding God said it better BAM says in question and answers in August of 64 he says what's the use of jumping up and down and shouting and speaking in tongues if you don't know what it's all about he says you got to understand why you were there yeah there's got to be understanding to it he says you can't headlong long plunge into something that you when you don't know where you're going you've got to know by faith now he's in this prayer he's telling a story about a woman when he came to pray for her he says sister do you remember me and she was trying to open her eyes she said who is it I said brother branham and watch this she says and she started crying tears swollen face young woman about twenty-two old brother branham shake my hand shake my hand hey sis now just don't be hysterical sister I took a hold of her hand I said I come to have prayer she said oh and I said now be quiet be quiet don't get all emotional wait till God heals you and then get emotional he says and so I said come solid saintly listen to me now here's a sister that needed healing and she's getting hysterical she's getting emotional she's getting worked up and brother Bannon realizes that won't that won't bring faith if you pondered this that brother Branham said there was people that were healed at Beatles concerts then the the mechanics of that and even to accept the dynamic it is in an emotional realm in an excitement even a misappropriation of confidence or belief and it produces he's the one that indicates it that there's some expression of deliverance or healing in that in that setting not I mean maybe I mentioned it in a where it it deserves a sunday-school so you might have to come back and clean up my mess I'm just kind of just throwing it out there like hey what do you think about that we'll see you guys later it causes you to wonder why that's that's that's amazing and brother man who realizes now you can get all worked up may feel better but that won't bring a permanent healing because soon as you lose that enthusiasm what happens you just be sick again so he says you got to come sane sane ly solidly you got to listen to the word so there has to be some sense there should be a sub sameness that has to be the emotions have to be brought in a line there has to be some harmony emotional harmony so that you're not leaning to any extreme and there's a balance for that moment for you to accept the Word of God take him at his word that's exactly what the word preach does it aligns our spirits with the word it brings our emotions under subjection to the word for our faith to operate preaching is not meant to whip us into a frenzy preaching is not meant to get us all worked up through emotionalism but it stood it's to tie us to distr sup deeply within our souls for something within your soul to rise up say I take God at His Word I believe him for his word and there's a way that the word could the gospel can be presented where it is at the on the majority stirring you up and the majority of people are being stirred up emotionally but yet if the word is coming behind it and in that channel things that may be working only emotional on some people can actually be received deeply in the soul of another and you can have a whole church that's slain in the spirit and then just a real quiet sister back there being delivered of cancer because you just say thank you thank you because the word drops down into that channel and so the preacher of the word is not to get us worked up emotionally but to bring our emotions subject to the word and again I'm on a call back to what I said in the beginning I'm in no way preaching against emotions we are emotional beings and the Word of God the Word of God be in the scripture and the message recognize that and identify that and do not try to strip emotions from our experience and and do not strip the word from dealing with our emotions as a matter of fact in my heart I see the majority of the Word of God being directed towards the born-again believer so that their character can be perfected and their spirits may be perfected in order to match the perfect body because it's a God who hath redeemed our souls and will one day redeem our bodies and is right now redeeming our spirits and so so much of the word is aligning our thoughts and our affections and teaching us how to treat our wives teaching us to not be harsh towards our children it all deals in an emotional realm so I'm not disregarding emotions at all as a matter of fact I'm trying to say that our attitude for so long that basically said well if you've got a problem just you just need the Holy Ghost time's misses the point that yes you need the Holy Ghost but the word needs to deal with our emotions first so he can get the Holy Ghost could you imagine telling an adult who struggled and struggled and struggled and knows they need the Holy Ghost and tells you they got this problem that problem and they come to brother Jason Jason III you're the assistant pastor but I know the pastor speaks to you but I gotta just ask you and I've got this problem and that problem my lifestyle this my life's done that and buddy she just goes well you just need the holy guys you know what the person probably say I know that you know I know that I don't know what it is though that's keeping me from it what is the Holy Spirit do it can go right down in there and find to get that person in that right state of mind when they have that clarity what a brother man talk about that one sister now when you see she said oh and she heard mine came back to her he said right now sister look to Calvary right now I you're in your right mind look to Calvary what is the dynamics of the word putting the person in the right emotional state not that the right emotional state was the final product but putting in her place where she could receive the promise and so a lot of times we're dealing with people and their experience and we're telling why you need the Holy Ghost they know they need the Holy Ghost but they need the word to put them in the right emotional state to get the Holy Ghost and could you imagine how defeating that would be if the assistant pastor told this person well brother you just need the holding go she says Jason I thought I had it I thought I had a new birth experience I I don't have any sin in my life I that I any repetitive sins or habitual sins I love the Lord I've been faithful just really struggle with this and I've had this problem I got angry at work or whatever why you just need the holy God and in both instances the words not addressing the need this might be an adult that needs to let go bitterness it might be somebody that's had some route to follow them and it did word needs to the word needs to take this and deal in an emotional realm do some gardening so to speak brother branham is telling a story it when he preaches a sermon lie to 1957 how he visited a world a girl in an insane asylum as she was a Christian girl if I recall and that she had I might even been that her passion her dad was a preacher I may be kind of amalgamating different things together do I put 25 cents in a jar someone told me about him when a lawyer uses the big word he has to pay throw something in the jar so 20 cents cheaper uh and and how his brother BAM said that she'd went to college and their colleges professor had perverted her and she'd gone crazy and brother says this now him being a psychiatrist he swung the girl's mind until now she becomes so evil so bad till she didn't even want to hear the name of Jesus spoken in her presence and even her father mother can't even see her no more she had lost her mind and this next week we'll go to the institution for shock treatment it's because that she turned her thoughts from Christ she turned her thoughts from Christ unto what that psychiatrist was moving her mind to where was he was moving her mind now let's establish this very clearly what happened to this young girl is what how she was thinking was turned from the things of God to a perversion it's swung her - she went crazy and he says that the psychiatrist swung the girls mind so through psychology through what his his a discourse they're working on her mind he swung her mind from the thoughts of Christ to thoughts of the world and her and she went insane now we might make the mistake then that if she's gone crazy in her head then what she needs is I need to take this hand and plant it firmly on the middle of her forehead and rock it back and forth in the name of Jesus Christ and shut that nasty devil out of her my dad tells the story he'll appreciate this he tells the story when he first came to the message he wasn't Pentecostal and he said the sister was coming through the prayer line and he said rated blaze this has to bless God heal her neck and she went straighten right out and he's like hallelujah now she was he didn't know that was just how you how they worship and so in our in our minds and our thinking we're thinking this devil needs to be cast out of her we would think psychology and the turning of her mind perverted her so we would maybe run the other way listen to brother Browns words and that's what we are here for this morning is to move your mind the devil accomplished the perversion in this girl's life by swinging her mind and turning her thoughts and then brother BAM says I'm here to do the same thing today I'm here to move your mind I'm here to swing your thoughts that's what we're here for this morning is to move your mind and your thinking from the things of the world until the things of God which are eternal unto the things of god which are eternal and that's what preaching is for is to pervert the thinking to a higher and better into a place where Christ is until you become converted then your mind reaches for those things which are above my goodness programs in the very mechanics and dynamics of preaching is that the word is preached so that your mind is first turned from worldliness to godliness it's swain of the mind from bad thoughts to pure thoughts so the first thing that happens by preaching the word is it lies that channel up so the word can get to your soul the first thing preaching is he says to pervert so it's to change preaching and change it from one thing to another preaches to revert your thinking it's it's not as if you're going to sit there in your mind thinking there's nothing to this there's nothing through this is nothing to this and also in your soul goes wow praise the Lord the mind descents the mind agrees the channel opens up so then your mind reaches out so the word deals with our emotions it does it to make them subject to the word bringing us are in the right mind to decide a right time to decide that's why when the spirit is moving with the word has come forth you find yourself in places of clarity and peace with God it's in that moment that you that you want to stand upon faith it's the moment you want to make that decision make that confession brother Branham says and just once more Lord coz this'n we could settle for just a cleansing of our spirits we can settle for just a washing out we can settle just because we see crowd Calvary but it's in that moment you've got to make the decision even when it comes right down to putting what you say you believe into practice and willing to confess the wrong they don't do it it just isn't there they don't have it well that's real conviction that's what we need we've long left a long time ago and swapped in prayer and confession and conviction we've swapped it for emotion a shaking or a jerking or jumping up and down that's the reason there is no holding tight because there's nothing there to hold them until you come upon the basis of God's Word now notice not without emotion he says of godly sorrow ready to repent so that's a feeling that's a readiness of mind and make anything right and do what's right ready to live so he's referring to your intent he's referring to your motive and objective he's dealing with the person's emotions their thoughts and feelings that bring them to the right balance in order to go forward and their experience with Christ let's not settle for that moment when we feel better when we feel better that's the time to go another step maybe we're just always coming to that place where we feel better when you feel better go forward don't be in the cycle of feeling good feeling bad feeling good feeling bad take a step higher I feel good I want to get gooder I feel good I know there's more I don't listen we're gonna walk until better becomes best so I want to get better I want to get better I want to get better until better comes becomes best listen once you've been sealed into the body of Christ it's good getting gooder if you're not sealed it's bad getting battered listen you either need a new birth experience or go forward with it says you know I heard some time in a meeting here long ago someone said just let your mind go blank now he said just look right straight up towards the skies let your mind go blank you'll get an experienced service there's no doubt like what you would that's right you get an experience but what an experience you see when you do that you just open your soul to Satan he'll give you something that's true but I think a person coming to Christ should come with all the intelligence they got quoting in their mind when they come to him every promise in the scripture you're sitting in your emotions on crisis you're making the word the focal point they says with all the intelligence you have quoting the promise keep your mind alert when you come to Christ don't let it go blank the devil will make you do anything they'll give you a sensation he can do that too but you want an experience something that the Bible teaches something that's real it's anchored in the promise he says you've gotten that I'm just gonna start just naming a few here he goes you've got to come first sanely soundly and god's provided way of approach to him and in that place father they come sanely moving up not emotionally just come soberly and no place I believe God's fixing to do something great but now we got to approach it sanely intelligently and write in the Word of God it's taking that emotional faith that intellectual faith and place it upon the word and being focused about the promise in not the things of the flesh not even what's transpiring around you there's the times of the Holy Spirit of God is moving in a dynamic way in meetings and conventions especially in youth camps and you'll hear the cry the cry go out and a shouting and screaming and if you don't pick up the sound of it and the message it's actually torment it's actually an outburst and you could sense it sometimes they'll just give you chills and not because it's the rejoicing of a saint but it's summon wrestling with spirits wrestling's with demons and they just yell out a very tormenting cry and then another one does the same thing and another one does the same thing and we might be going oh praise the Lord in that wonderful but it's it's it's in the wrestling it's in the battle it's in that moment that they need the prayers of God they need their mind to be focused on the promise not all just let it out let it go vent yourself sister just pour it out oh it's been hard life's been hard yeah just VIN it out you've made mistakes just spit it out and then when you it's like almost prophetic weights like I've expressed it I've gotten it out this and I'm in that moment oh just spring it out but yet they didn't come according to the world where Branson works his faith express he says if he promised that he has to do it because he has to keep his word and he promised you the same thing that is if you would believe that it would happen if you can't believe it just won't happen now I can't make you believe neither can you make yourself believe God has to give it to you it's a gift of God to believe not your faith God's faith says your intellectual faith might believe it fine but unless the faith of God is done in your heart and I love this balance see your intellectual faith can accept it do that so if your intellectual faith can accept it do that what I'm emphasizing today is if your intellectual faith believes the message then reject it know if it can do that I mean you do a lot that a lot of people can't do you're still unreasonable to the world even though it's intellectual but you still haven't met God's requirements he says if you can intellectually accept it do that and just keep believing it with all your heart until dark God does reveal it to you just keep believing it until God does reveal it so if all you can do is intellectually believe it then just keep believing her just keep holding on to it and that's what Paul is expressing to the Corinthians he says our weapons are of our warfare are not carnal but mighty through God to the pulling down of strongholds so he says casting down imaginations every high thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ imaginations it's a wreck and it's a calculation in your mind it's a reasoning which opposes God's Word and he's saying that we have to take any thought that's in competition to God's Word and we must cast it down and we don't do this by being loud we don't do this by being emotional we don't do this by saying well I'm just going to walk seven times around my computer it's not anything that we work up and we may try through emotions to get yet get to the place where we can deny something and accept something but it won't work you have to do it on the basis of God's Word we cannot try to manufacture faith in his word through emotionalism that won't last but mom talk she says it this way they had to have a little feeling or something little sensation one this and that and the other and they depended on that he couldn't teach them the deep things so I think it's a it's great when you get a people that you can teach deep things and the Holy Spirit can wind these great truths and anchor it into the people's hearts so that they know where they're standing sensation or no sensation prophecy or no prophecy and whatever it might be this is what brother Branham desires this is what he desired in his own ministry says but when they have to have a little feel in a little sensation this that and the other and they depend upon that he couldn't teach them the deep things it says if you get I love it we have a people you can teach deep things where the word can just be rightly divided it anchors in the hearts and they know where they're standing sensation and OH sensation you so much we just wanted to express here Paul writes in Romans chapter 10 he said they had a zeal speaking of Israel he said my heart's desire that God would bless him he said they have a zeal of God but not according to knowledge zeal that's not channeled towards present truth zooming is an excitement of mine an ardent fervor of something fervor of spirit but he's saying it's not stimulated by the word its enthusiasm but it's Genesis isn't the word coming to pass but the visco made her statement one time he said true worship is connected with the Word of God being fulfilled it never left me I thought that is the only way you could truly worship it has to be connected with the Word of God otherwise what is being worshiped what is being exalted it became a revelation to me one time I went into a charismatic service and literally everyone will stand around talking punching each other on the shoulder man they were just all having a good time and also the song leader got up there and he just went boop boop boop boop Pat it on the mic a little bit and immediately everybody was like wow and I caught me off guard because immediately they were just shouting and praising and everything I'm like my goodness what just happened and I realized they're shouting trying to find God they're trying to work something they got to build themselves into a frenzy so when they've worked up a sweat and somebody passes out in somebody dances and they get so wild and crazy the preacher can't preach they can say my goodness didn't got to have his way and I realized we've got it in the exact opposite it's it's after the word that has gone forth that we find ourselves the most expressive in worship and it doesn't have to be an excitable service it's just once the words gone forth we find ourselves our spirits are aligned we have a harmony with the word and we just feel we man we've been brought back to Center we believe God's Word and we begin to worship a present Christ not trying to find him somewhere not trying to call him out of heaven like they did on Mount Carmel but because he's a present God who just made himself known to us through the Living Word what - is our God that deserves praise this is a God that deserves worship and we don't just sit and service just twiddling our thumbs for whatever the song leader can get back up there and when are we gonna get our worship no bill worship is building as the word goes forth it's building as the word goes forth and you're saying hey man I believe that that's nothing but the truth hey man and as it's coming for something build something build it's something built and when you give vent to that revelation it's not merely just a shout of wonder but it's AIT's like I believe this this is life to me oh thank God for this they had a zeal without knowledge excited emotional listen they had zeal they were so zealous they killed a man that they thought opposed their faith they were so zealous they would rather have a murderer than a blasphemer and a zeal without knowledge can be excited it could be emotional but it's not in harmony with the word because its zeal without knowledge it's zeal when God hasn't spoken its enthusiasm as a prophet saying go down there you can do it you can do it and everyone saying go you can go and then one man with the words thing don't do it he's so excited so emotional you can just slap the bride right across the face slap the word right across the face and say where did the Spirit of God go when it went from you you talk about enthusiasm boldness and emotion but God hasn't spoken our zeal and enthusiasm must be according to the word of the time in the day no other source no other interpretation brother Brennan speaking aloud to Saint Church eggy says now this false Church has zeal make no mistake about that but it is a wrong zeal for it is it is for the house of their own building it is for their own creeds dogmas and organizations their own righteousness you can say about Jesus when he went brother BAM even said about Jesus when he braided those whips and purged the money changers from the house of God he said he wasn't operate in the fruits of the Spirit and he puts it in that context I think we might have Minister on that before and I know all of you just remember perfectly when we preached on love a decade ago or whatever and we point out that Jesus wasn't operating the fruits of the spirit when he did that but yet he was operating according to prophecy so even though it might look like anger even though it might look like an extreme and even though it might look like fanaticism the zeal of thine house hath eaten me up it was thine house and it was prophecy that made him to act so it wasn't out of he says but they have a house of their own building it's for their own creeds dogmas organizations their own righteousness they have put the word out for their own ideas they deposed the Holy Ghost and made men into leaders they have put aside eternal life as a person and made it good works or even church conformity rather than good words listen if I can say this don't live to go to church go to church to live your life isn't about this but but God has put this in your life for life we just don't live for our church experience but our life includes this we go to church to live we have the proper balance yes our life isn't these four walls and we just don't live for it for Bethel Tabernacle but we go to Bethel Tabernacle to live because we see it has a place in the Word of God that there's more to it than just hearing preaching let's be a part of the body part of a move of God part of a local fellowship and I realize that God ordains this not that this could be the all-in-all but that's through this I could reach the all and all that this is part of the all and all that through these organics and dynamics of this I will one day change my body by the faith that I have I will have a power to do it I will have power to be changed and I'll meet the Lord in the air this isn't the result of it that's just church conformity it's not just good works and church conformity my goodness we could get to the place where we just determined which works are the best well brother Jason I hear you're building church in Uganda who you think that's spiritual guess what I'm doing over here I'm feeding the poor in my local community let me start competing over who's actually doing something right when what's the measure you feel led to God to do to start a school you feel that of God to send instruments to the Philippines you feel that of God to go over in Muslim countries and do this you feel that of God to host these things and do these things bless may God bless you may God bless you may God bless you you better do your part because I'm doing mine I can only do mine and if you do yours and I do mind we're getting out of here but when I want to criticize your job and criticize yours job and act like I'm doing mine the this I ain't done my job yet wrong motive wrong objective even though it might be the word I haven't done my job yet listen whatever God reveals to you to do and you do it by revelation if you expect it through legalism for somebody else to do it you lose the blessing of your revelation God's revealed to me to do this well you better do it listen whatever blessing he wanted to give you in obedience you deprive yourself of it when you through legalism expected of somebody else play the part that God's called you to listen I can't be a dynamic man of God that sees cancer's follow that brings the place of the people to places where their things are revealed and things happen I may not have that kind of ministry but I cannot aspire to be that and miss out on what God's called me to i will not fulfill God's purpose so I'm happy to be what he's told me to be and I'm happy you are what you are because there's no way I could do my job if it wasn't for the men that are doing very no one person has it all figured out well my ministry can give you everything you need I've got the healing I've got the teaching I got the dynamic I'm all 5 in 1 you're probably not one of them please don't judge me by your gift I'll fall short every time I'm not gonna judge you by my gift will fall short every time be what God's called you to be do you mind if I finish alright that's that sounds like a quorum brother Jason gave up this is the downside of me being able to see you now you can give me the non visual clues yeah no he says religious oh my they outshine the elect in effort and zeal but it is Laodicean not of christ don't confuse yourself with effort and zeal there's times and let me just be very direct there are certain gatherings around false doctrine that'll be much more charismatic and dynamic than any service we have and they use the charisma and the dynamics as vindication that they're right and then they say you don't you don't have this because what are they entered on and he says Africa's ill he says it's lay over seeing out of Christ for it looks for big crowds big programs startling signs among them they preach and I'm just let this be real rich to you they preach the second coming of Christ but deny the advent of the Prophet messenger are you picking up what he's laying down are you filling them it's a third pull he can't just come right out and say yeah they preached the Second Coming but they denied the very introduction though in power and signs and true revelation he eclipses them all yes this false spirit that in the last days is so close to the real can be distinguished only by its deviation from the word we only needed one prophet I don't need another one I had my messenger but this false peer can only be known not by its lack of signs and wonders but by its deviation from the word and whenever it is caught in being anti word it falls back on one argument we have already shown to be false we get results don't we we have to be of God that's intellectual faith that's emotional things well don't come challenging me that I don't believe the message look at the results I get look at the fruits of it and instead of saying well let's be one with the word let's identify ourselves with the word this must be God and we believe this is God but there's more word let's walk in it they fall back on this excuse that the results are enough for them to deny the word there's Villas not according to knowledge that hasn't been centered I might want to say it hasn't been birthed by the word of the hour but it hasn't been calibrated imbalanced it hasn't been brought into harmony with the floor to the our our emotional intellectual faith is not enough if that's all we have keep doing it till the revelation comes but we must have a revelation of the word of this age the wrong zeal can actually as I mentioned before crucify the word for its day it can be dogmatic here's brother Jason DeMars I'm getting used to the brother JD but it's brother Jason to Mars who said that there's times when we're very dogmatic where God allows differences and allow differences where God's dogmatic and we shouldn't do that and there's people that get dogmatic and they're so dogmatic they persecute the Sunday School lesson could just be I hear is hearing incorporated by reference what was all that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution and we're suffering because all hell is against this revelation that you have the truth alone and so zeal enthusiasm it can persecute it can bully it can intimidate but what matters is the word I'm not preaching against emotions I'd be a hypocrite because I'm getting emotional what if my preaching against it but well I'm wanting to place them on the right foundation I let me finish with this thought who's trying to find it identify this place of rest here if our emotions come from the word then there is no disorder our excitement our enthusiasm our worship our praise our amens if they're birthed by the word then then we it's it's it's in continuity with the spirit there's times where we are we are challenged even the dynamics of preaching say amen to that and and we might find ourselves they then pulled it right out of you will you say praise Lord pray Lord it's just kind of its kind of pulled out in you if I do it if I tell you to say man just something you can't say a man to just bite your lip and I'll just give you the Liberty no I won't it's my brother another brother says can you say amen to that and you can't just go no brother I'm right here with you I'm following you I hear what you're saying but no can say Amen that because we don't want to be pulled into some and there's some activity that it's just this isn't that responsive a reflex of the word of God that Amen and you find yourself excited by the word invigorated by it don't you love the fact that you can come to church looking forward to it is anybody ever been in a church we just didn't look forward to going to it don't raise your hands honey and you weren't excited about it you're like whoa I'm gonna have to do this I'm gonna have to do that and I'm gonna have to yeah and it's it's the worst thing in the world that's wonderful to come to church and have an excitement and enthusiasm and that word to keep building it and building and where that is in harmony and where that is in your heart then praise an expression with if the words first then let it come let me just say this I'm bringing it to a close the seals are opened what wouldn't we worship we're taught after they're open everything is worship we've got reason to praise we've got reason to shout we've got reason to dance we've got reason to live the life we've got reason we'd listen I love a ministry that makes the Seventh Seal relevant on Monday to Saturday not just appropriate on Sunday morning I love it when it hits home and it makes sense every day and it does it just doesn't result in charismatic services or conventions I love a message that's relevant in my daily life and that's what Lucia Smita praise that's what gives me living in the come to church and know this isn't hypocrisy this is coming from my life live by the word [Applause] well the best is everywhere you found Jesus you found a little noise the seals reveal Christ he is those seals that were open he said that kind of fits my Irish disposition and especially when it's been changed what does he acknowledge that some of us are predisposed to it excitement enthusiasm noise may fit your disposition that's why even without a berth you can enjoy certain services even without a berth you enjoy songs even without a berth you could take young people raised in the message who are sanctified who are living clean lives and without a berth you can you can have certain songs that work them to a place of worship and it's entirely through an emotional realm nothing wrong with it at all nothing wrong with it at all we just it can just fit our disposition and it's so if it doesn't fit your disposition don't be critical of it if it just if it doesn't fit if you're not Irish if you're more German brother man said hey where Jesus is there's a lot of noise if it's my disposition it may not fit yours but my goodness don't be critical of Jesus I mean inject this I mean I've taken maybe I've made the mistake of not making myself clear sometimes when I've preached on Pentecost and Pentecostalism and some people just maybe default to say well Pentecostalism that's them that's a way of worship it's a way it expresses no it has nothing to do that Pentecostalism is a failure to walk further in the Word of God has nothing to do with how you how you conduct your song services it has nothing to do with your expression and worship someone can be just as Pentecostal and never one time raise their hands they could be they could be fully possessed by Pentecostalism and never want to shout Amen because it Pentecost was not walking further in the revealed word of the hour where Jesus is there's always noise so it's not whether you're predisposed to emotion or whether or not you're making a lot of noise are you in the word it's the only way you're gonna know if you're walking in truth only way you're gonna know is if you're in the word so everywhere Jesus appears in the message who is Jesus there's usually somebody there to hear him and before he got there he heard a noise so we want to hear him not the noise but recognize that where he is there's noise and they were singing all kinds of song glory to God in the highest and all these fine hands they were singing in some screaming and shouting he says isn't it strange where Jesus is there's always a lot of noise so where Jesus is there's always noise but the message isn't in the noise the message is in his voice we appears he wants to speak and there's always someone there to hear him so we know that where he is there's noise but I don't want to be satisfied with the noise I want to hear him listen the wind the fire and the earthquake declared the presence of God he passed by and there was an earthquake he passed by and there was a wind he passed by and there was an earthquake but the message was in the still small voice he was made known in the voice I don't I don't want the knocking I don't want the noise I want the voice but I recognized that the noise comes before the voice and when he's describing this same what scriptures being fulfilled he comes riding in and fulfillment scripture Hosanna glory to God in the highest the shouting singing praises to him and turned right around and with the same mouth shout crucify oh brother BAM said phew recognized him to be the anointed word of the day what were they worship even him in the enthusiasm of the moment not even realizing what they were doing and we're not just worshiping in the enthusiasm of it we're not worshiping in a glare we're not worshiping under some kind of manufactured Pentecost we have the original Pentecost we've been restored back to Pentecost it's not a dirty word it's not the possession of a domination it's not some other it's not some man's idea it's the bride's and we're worshipping in Revelations five we're worshiping in Revelations 10 we've recognized they don't know two words for this day there was noise there was commotion but really how many solved the attraction Jesus said is the spirit that quickeneth the flesh profiteth nothing the words that I speak unto you they are spirit and they are life it's the word first let the word bring the healing let the word bring the praise let the word bring the manifestations but Aram said jesus never distressed the importance of works as he did the word he knew that the people got the word the works would follow that is Bible if the people got the word the works will follow we'll invite the musicians to come he said Jesus didn't stress the importance of works over the word and so he didn't and he didn't downplay one or the other he just put it in order he knew that people got the word the work should follow so why would you preached against works it's what follows the word and so if you preach against works you only hinder the word but if he preached works first you still hinder the word it's got to be in order so if it seems like Mambro the errand has just been like a pendulum swing well I'm just trying to pull from here trying to pull from they're trying to bring right in the middle to make you realize we've got to be centered on the Word of God it's got to be right in harmony with the truth of it as a young man it ran in the it ran in our family manic depression spirits of melancholy I remember going back and reading my great-grandmother's diary and I would read her words and I'd feel the same feeling she was feeling and it was almost haunting I I know I know how she feels the blue she had to think she was experiencing and I say I know a place in Christ that changes all that there's joy in this message one of my favorite sayings and all the messages at the very very end of the church age book it's not prophecy it's reality and may his coming rejoice your heart we're living in a reality that gives us joy and my joy comes from him my rest comes from him it's not based in Laodicea forgive me I don't mean this disrespectfully it's not even based upon an uncommon uncommon promise it's rooted in a reality it's based upon his the forgiveness of sins the baptism of the Holy Ghost the newness of life and nothing stimulates me more and gets me more excited than the Word of God nothing thrills me more than this message and there's nothing more invigorating and stimulating for you believers may be coming out of the shadow these stay-at-home orders in the specter of a pandemic that is trying to bring us low listen it's time for us to put shoulders back and heads up and rejoice and praise and be loosed because we're not bound by fear we're not bound by politics we're not waiting for the cycle of an election to know which way we're gonna praise which way we're gonna run and what we're going to do we're going up we're going up and this bride is enjoying the stimulation of Revelation the power of Revelation brings stimulation to the believer the power of natural wine stimulates brings a person that's all slumped down to stimulation he goes Weldon now there's a power of Revelation of the word that distillations of joy to the believer stimulation of satisfaction stimulation that it's vindicated it's proved as natural wine reveals itself and stimulated power so does the new one as it reveals the Word of God which is spirit the word itself is spirit on 6:63 the word itself is spirit its spirit in Word form then you see when it's quickened are brought to life the spirit of the word goes to work and acts you have the stimulation of Revelation behind you that's the joy you have though the random in the easter cele says there's a lot of people that really think they got it when they haven't a lot of people do it because they've got some false impression of what they seen other Christians do Satan can impersonate any event we don't want to have like a mimetic compulsion that's what all these means are dealing with and it's some kind of it's like a we say it goes viral yeah it's referring to an infection and everybody starts doing the same thing what are you doing if you ever wonder why your kids are over there doing these funny things it's tick tock don't worry about it well maybe you should worry about it but they're all wondering can you do this dance can you do that can you do this and it infects them and they all begin to act and we see that compulsion work through social media and apps like snapchat and kick talking these things and what is it doing it's working in a round to cause human nature to mimic and we can do the same thing as an impersonator of the real within Christ don't settle for an impersonation get the real thing don't shout because she shouted you shout because you've got it chat with nobody else's dance when nobody else does does praise when nobody else is praising smile and nobody else to smiling why because I got it that on the inside he says as missionaries you can see it in person it shouting dancing speaking in tongues all these things you can see it impersonating anywhere absolutely amongst heathens and people who deny there's even such a thing as Jesus Christ being the son of God and they do all these things themself but the real true quickening spirit that comes to a believer quickens them to God's Word that's back to Eagles food again hey man look I think about how excited we get when we go to eat we get on you know chippy hey man hey how's it going you feel good it's my favorite restaurant whoo checks on me oh my goodness this is awesome everybody gets excited we're feasting on a failing body word of the son of man now we're back to Eagles food again I wanna soar above all these carnal things Carl impersonations so our above intellectual faith so our above emotionalism floor above formalism I want to be balanced as an eagle soaring into the heavenlies and the revelation of the manifestation of the word of this hour has stimulated me stimulates the believer not an interpretation not an impersonation but the very manifestation of the vindicated promise today it stimulates me I won't repress and I won't mimic I won't do anything but yield to the power of God listen if your mind is clear right now before God if through these things we've wondered back and forth of the word if you feel you have an emotional alignment with the Word of God whatever you have need of in this very moment why don't you take God at His Word and receive it not in the work up of it not in the enthusiasm of it even disregard my fervent sing now and just merely look to the promise by his stripes come him God gave the promise that I'd be safe he'd give me the baptism of the holy accept it now in the name of the Lord let's stand to our feet as real believers we accept these things we believe it what is it listen I oh my goodness what a pullings bunch well I know why you cancel the evening service you just heard why you don't have one because you you're likely to preach into the evening it's good thing you didn't preach brother Danny I've heard it preached before I mean no disrespect to the way that it's typed but the story when Jesus visited the Pool of Bethesda the angel the Lord would come and stir the waters and whoever got in got healed and we can accurately we can preach the angel the Lord is stirring the waters get in but the truth that was revealed in that instance was even a that without the waters being stirred Christ is here to meet your need because that's exactly what happened he said I don't have any way to jump into the stirring of the waters and here was the way the truth the life here is the one who could heal him in his need and it wasn't the stirring of the waters anymore it was at one time but now Christ had come to the elective Christ had audience to the one who was ordained the one who had a need for many many years and it wouldn't be met in the stirring of the waters where anyone would come in but now where people misunderstood the love and compassion of God Christ comes down in the midst of the confused and perverse in chaotic age and he comes only to the elect to give them the healing they need I love it when the waters are stirred but right now Christ the word has made himself known to you receive him take him at his word no I believe devil says wow you got a little bit of work well okay that's just in this flesh that's evidence of nothing greater is He that is in me greater is He that is in man listen the trick the devil's played on us is we've taken what seems great and it is big but we've made it greater and you might have in yourself I have a little bit of faith brother here and I have a little bit of faith to believe but got a whole lot of doubt and it's a forced perspective of the devil that makes the doubt look bigger than faith because if you have the least amount of faith it's greater than all the doubt in the world so you take what you have this morning whatever the least is you take it and you fight whatever is great and you say it's greater it's greater its greater this strength is greater it may not seem like much but it's greater why it's connected with the eternal it's Treg connected with the endless let's bow our heads in prayer just thank them now for his touch thank him now for the victory thank him now for the healing thank them for the deliverance thank him for the assurance how could you give that in the absence of an evidence or manifestation faith moves me to worship faith moves me to praise faith moves me to worship under the revelation that's why I'm walking the way that I'm walking or blessed be the name of the law maybe you could just play the song bless the Lord O my soul oh my gosh up the Lord a little bit thank you Jesus thank you Lord Jesus let's just pray our gracious Heavenly Father you're real Lord Lord it strikes us deep or deep this word is real Lord I pray you have spoken to needs today Lord I had no doubt in my heart that I was to speak this I have no wavering even now having delivered it and may you make yourself known to your daughter and your son you knew before the foundation of the world they would intersect with this sermon and may it come welling up inside of them even as they had prayed may they feel this unction of the Holy Ghost say I have heard you'll cry and I am come down to deliver you may it be base solidly upon the promise may they accept it according to thy word I commit them to you Lord in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray bless the Lord O my soul O my soul worship his holy [Music] seemed like never before my less the Lord bless the Lord O my soul O my soul his whole gotta sing it my baby oh my singing again Oh bless the Lord O my soul O my soul worship his home nay like never before oh my do you sing this often I'm sorry I thought I was singing do you sing the song you are God alone let's sing that let's just work there's only one God and there's no other God this message doesn't reveal another God it reveals the one true God let them worship their God let them worship our God through their understanding but God becomes the god to whom he reveals himself and Jill are the ones he's made himself known to so you are the one true worshipers of the Living God and he's not a God of your imagination he's a part of this bride and he's got alone let's just worship oh you were not a God created by human head you are not a god dependent on any mortal man you are not a God in me the very thing we can give by your plan that's just the way from before time began and you are wrong you are God in the good times and bad you are God oh you're the only guy whose power none can contend you're the only God whose name and raise would never end and you're the only God who's worthy of everything we can give oh you are God and that's just the way from before time began you are on death row in the good times and fire oh he's unchangeable he's unshakable oh he's unstoppable oh that's what we'll keep singing it till you believe it oh he's unchangeable his unshakable oh that's what you are singing again I'm changeable all these unchangeable this is unshakable oh he's unstoppable that's what you are he's not alone he is God from before time began [Music] oh you are [Music] you are God [Music] [Applause] [Music] right now [Music] you are on your [Music] [Music] that's what [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] it's wonderful to know that God has sent a word so powerful that it dismisses all other arguments I don't care what other argument your symptom is shouting at you I don't care what other argument your mind may be telling you I realized today I have a new appreciation for brother Branham saying the right mental attitude toward any promise of God because sometimes we got to have the word to get our mental attitude right so that's not perfect faith but that's so perfect faith King Tom how many perceived perfect faith today take this mental attitude toward the promise of God it's more powerful than your sickness more powerful than your trouble more powerful than your circumstance say but my circumstance is real I was fine I'm to say they don't matter the only thing that matters is his word and that he's in control of it all so I love I love I don't think I've ever heard it said like that that sure say well my fear feels real yeah but it's not an evidence yeah but the circumstances it's quite this circumstance I'm in brothers quite real but that's no evidence think about a word that came in dismisses all evidence contrary to God's Word then I don't have to argue with the devil then I can just dismiss it I can truly say Satan you just don't matter and the circumstance fine whatever but it don't matter I believe the word I accepted for me today in my circumstance I'll praise it right in the trial I'll praise don't wait till it's over that's an insult don't wait till it's over don't wait till the victory comes crazy now Amen give vent to your faith by worshipping God in the midst of the trial in the midst of the storm you notice in the midst of the storm the disciples are terrified Jesus wasn't at all terrified he didn't have to wait till he rebuked the storm he woke up not terrified in the story he went to sleep in the storm you know what he did he just you know why cuz the Bible said God giveth his servants rest so you know what he was took not at his word when sleep and when he woke up and they said Lord don't you care that we perish nobody was gonna perish Jesus was in the boat nobody was gonna perish can you just accept that today so he's in my boat I ain't perishing hallelujah I got the master of the wind so it doesn't matter come what may whatever he's allowed fine brother Eddie used to always say that fine you know say it's so dismissive of the devil you know he'd say well this could happen that can I'm fine and he always throw up that hand Wendy's sister mom hey man just throw up that hand go fine it didn't matter only God's Word mattered a man he's a man of great faith amen praise the Lord oh well it's been good to be in the house it's even better to be the house amen now in a virtual way in a literal way however your faith is perhaps a canvas somebody come of our transect give them a real handshake give them whatever you feel amen family the family we're all the family of God amen praise the name of the Lord I don't want to have to tell you where your faith is where your faith is operate there amen and if you say Lord and if all you can say is Lord I believe help thou my unbelief I think God will honor an honest heart life praise the name of the Lord well it's been granted granted all the way around amen and to have brother Aaron here they've got to head back later this afternoon brother Tim sister Kay gonna be here for several more days y'all might even I heard stay through the whole week amen so we're gonna let him stay in the house and living it like they own it and just stay there and vacation this where everybody comes vacations so great you know people ask me where you live I say on a postcard I go overseas in this and what our brother where you from I said I live on an island on South Atlantic I'm an Islander come on so yeah I'm perpetually on a mission trip is that what you said so JD you want to go anywhere you're in a mission trip brother well we're gonna let you be dismissed we've got an afternoon of fellowship planned and so anybody that can stay around for fellowship we're gonna keep these preachers amen brother Dan how long y'all gonna hang out you got a flight later tonight from Atlanta so we'll keep you for a little while anyway before you have to spit at all that's a southern word you'll stick around you'll learn it okay so we're gonna have plenty of fellowship amen god bless you let's bow our heads on the master what a wonderful time what a joyous celebration of the presence of God there's no you know Lord any other celebration that doesn't involve your presence really just illegitimate it's not even worth celebrating Lord if you're not involved in our lives what's the point if you're not my daily bread then what can I even do Lord everything is in you I've invested my whole life in you Lord I'm sold out to the kingdom of God I'm just trying to tell everybody I possibly can what a wonderful place it is to come and live in the planet Jesus amen I've created a world brother BAM said I have enough power faith to create a world and go live on it so I just went ahead and did it I created a world called planet Jesus I live there I invite everybody else come live there it's a wonderful place of
