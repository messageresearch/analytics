[34:21] upon man's wisdom
[34:23] for my joy and happiness
[34:26] amen i i think probably a
[34:29] two-party system is an illusion anyway
[34:31] that's just me i think it's just an
[34:34] illusion to think make you think you got
[34:35] choice i know this the beast powers
[34:37] behind it all up
[34:38] all of it i don't care which side the
[34:40] beast's power

[35:01] colossians chapter 2
[35:04] wonderful letter
[35:06] from saint paul to the church at
[35:08] colossae he says here in verse 8 or
[35:10] catch 8 through 19.
[35:13] we'll let you be seated
[35:16] colossians chapter 2 verse 8 through 19
[35:20] beware
[35:22] lest any man spoil you spoil you
[35:25] through philosophy and vain deceit
[35:29] after the tradition of men
[35:31] after the rudiments of the world
[35:34] and not after christ so i'm already
[35:37] ahead of the game
[35:38] because
[35:40] you know political parties have spent
[35:42] obscene amounts of money trying to give
[35:45] you vain philosophy
[35:47] and i'm not bound by it i don't believe
[35:49] any of it i am looking to christ and i
[35:52] want his mind that's that's my great
[35:55] goal in life verse 9. for in him this is
[35:59] the this is the lord
[36:01] for in him dwelleth all the fullness of
[36:04] the godhead
[36:05] bodily
[36:07] and ye are complete in him isn't that
[36:10] wonderful
[36:11] which is the head of all principality
[36:14] and power
[36:16] in whom also ye are circumcised with the
[36:18] circumcision made without hands
[36:22] in putting off the body of the sins of
[36:24] the flesh by the circumcision of christ
[36:28] buried with him in baptism
[36:31] wherein also ye are risen with him
[36:34] through the faith of the operation
[36:38] of god
[36:39] who hath raised him from the dead
[36:42] and you
[36:44] being dead in your
[36:46] in your sins
[36:47] and the uncircumcision of your flesh
[36:51] hath he quickened together with him
[36:53] having forgiven you all trespasses
[36:57] blotting out the handwriting of
[36:59] ordinances
[37:00] that was against us
[37:02] which was contrary to us
[37:05] and took it out of the way
[37:07] nailing it to his cross
[37:09] and having spoiled that means disarmed
[37:14] he disarmed amen brother kevin you've
[37:16] had to disarm some people in your day
[37:18] he having disarmed principalities and
[37:22] powers
[37:23] he made a show of them openly
[37:26] triumphing over them in it
[37:29] let no man therefore in other words
[37:31] because of everything we just read
[37:34] let no man therefore judge you in meter
[37:36] and drink or in respect of a holy day
[37:39] or of the new moon or of the sabbath
[37:41] days which are a shadow of things to
[37:44] come but the body is of christ
[37:47] let no man beguile you
[37:50] of your reward in a voluntary humility
[37:54] and worshiping of angels
[37:55] intruding into those things which he
[37:58] hath not seen vainly puffed up by his
[38:00] fleshly mind and not holding the head
[38:04] from which all the body by joints and
[38:07] bands
[38:08] having nourishment ministered and knit
[38:11] together increaseth with the increase
[38:15] of god so every time you know god brings
[38:19] an increase it it raises the whole
[38:21] family
[38:23] every time he becomes something more you
[38:26] become something more
[38:28] now he can't become any anything more
[38:30] than he's been but he as he unfolds
[38:32] himself and becomes known as he's
[38:35] becoming known you're becoming known
[38:36] amen
[38:38] all right let's pray
[38:39] father we thank you for your word now
[38:42] and i just am surrendering myself lord
[38:44] on this wednesday night i thank you for
[38:46] these people that have come out
[38:48] lord on a wednesday night to hear the
[38:50] word i pray for them i pray a special
[38:53] grace and blessing be upon them for
[38:55] their labor for their sacrifice lord for
[38:58] those who couldn't make it perhaps
[39:00] they're streaming tonight i pray your
[39:02] great blessing of the word be upon them
[39:04] as well
[39:05] grant it lord lift us up together in
[39:08] heavenly places lord we need you we need
[39:11] this this is a tumultuous time the world
[39:14] is going through lord and we know it
[39:17] can't continue much longer we know
[39:19] father the end of all things is at hand
[39:22] and so we confess our need of you
[39:24] tonight lord we ask humbly that you
[39:27] would supply us with everything that's
[39:29] needed you promised you would and so
[39:31] ours is to believe it and accept it and
[39:34] go forward in faith commit it to you in
[39:36] jesus name amen god bless your friends
[39:38] you can be seated
[39:49] so many
[39:50] wonderful
[39:52] promises
[39:54] of god
[39:56] you being dead
[39:59] in your sins
[40:01] and uncircumcision of your flesh
[40:03] hath he quickened together with him
[40:07] having forgiven you
[40:08] all of your trespasses now it's
[40:11] interesting because
[40:13] when we read this in verse 13 just let
[40:15] me have that back up brother kevin where
[40:17] we'll switch to that other translation
[40:19] in a moment but we'll stay in kjv for
[40:21] now but in verse 13 you being dead in
[40:24] your sins and the uncircumcision of your
[40:26] flesh remember
[40:28] that this dead doesn't mean annihilated
[40:31] it means separated so now you've been
[40:35] separated from the life of god see but
[40:38] you still have life
[40:40] you're still alive you're still a human
[40:42] you're still built in the image of god
[40:45] amen so it doesn't mean that you've been
[40:47] annihilated but you've been separated
[40:50] from his life your life is now separated
[40:53] from his life when you're in sins and
[40:56] trespasses you still bear the image of
[40:59] god but you are separated from god so
[41:03] we're it's as if then we're cut off from
[41:05] his spiritual life like i said now you
[41:08] still have human life all right you
[41:11] still have human life but now paul is
[41:14] showing to us that now god by his spirit
[41:18] has made you alive in other words
[41:20] rejoined you back to the original life
[41:24] amen so that and and he does it
[41:26] according to the scriptures uh we we
[41:29] won't go back and read it but paul dealt
[41:31] with it in the first chapter of
[41:32] colossians that he
[41:34] brings you back your original life
[41:38] using the same exact power that raised
[41:41] jesus from the dead
[41:43] amen not a different life not a
[41:44] different power
[41:46] you you think about resurrection
[41:48] mourning man that was some power
[41:50] here is the lord dead you know through
[41:52] through friday saturday into sunday
[41:55] morning and he's not faking death it's
[41:58] not almost dead he's completely dead
[42:01] and we realized that brother branham
[42:03] said that same quickening power
[42:05] that shook his body to life in a tomb
[42:08] that's the same quickening power that'll
[42:11] translate your mortal flesh in a rapture
[42:13] right amen
[42:14] but don't undervalue the fact that that
[42:18] power is already working in you and it's
[42:21] what reconnected you to god's life
[42:24] because you came here
[42:26] dead in trespasses and sin didn't mean
[42:29] you're annihilated you're still you
[42:32] still alive
[42:33] see you still got human life
[42:35] but you're cut off from the original
[42:38] source of life
[42:39] so we really now that's exactly why
[42:42] friends that
[42:43] when you're born again
[42:45] all right how many born again
[42:47] remember
[42:48] you're not annihilated
[42:51] the sin is still in your flesh amen but
[42:54] you but now because of the life of
[42:56] christ you're separated from sin it
[43:00] still lives in your flesh you still have
[43:02] to keep your mind subject but now you're
[43:05] separated not from god you're separated
[43:07] from the world now you're joined to god
[43:10] hallelujah
[43:11] so so we realized then that paul speaks
[43:14] here you know blotting out the
[43:17] handwriting of ordon's ordinances that
[43:20] was against us it's actually two things
[43:22] that you know first of all that god
[43:25] forgave you of all your trespasses
[43:28] all of them
[43:32] you know what
[43:33] i'm glad that every that all the
[43:36] trespasses he forgave me
[43:39] for
[43:40] some of them i haven't committed yet
[43:44] amen
[43:45] say how do you know that he did that
[43:47] because
[43:48] what he did he did 2000 years ago
[43:52] understand before i was even born
[43:56] before i had ever committed the first
[43:58] transgression i was already separated
[44:01] from death and joined back to christ and
[44:04] all the trespasses i have ever committed
[44:07] or will ever commit are already met in
[44:10] calvary
[44:12] and so not only did he
[44:14] forgive me of all my sins but but this
[44:18] actually when he says here in verse 14
[44:20] this this handwriting of ordinances
[44:23] is that he literally canceled
[44:26] as it were written code against me now
[44:28] some people say the law of moses and
[44:29] that's true in a sense it's a little bit
[44:32] a little bit shallow that doesn't really
[44:33] grasp it because
[44:35] men were still being condemned by god
[44:37] before the law of moses
[44:39] amen
[44:41] you know
[44:41] when when cain got condemned and got
[44:44] marked the law of moses wasn't anywhere
[44:46] in the world
[44:47] so you understand that what separated
[44:49] came from abel is cain believed
[44:51] and abel didn't
[44:53] king
[44:54] abel caught a revelation and he believed
[44:56] cain did not and therefore he was he was
[44:59] sealed in now he was given opportunity
[45:01] to save himself but he didn't take it
[45:03] and the lord warned him of that that sin
[45:05] lieth at the door you've got to conquer
[45:07] it and that's what he didn't do and
[45:08] that's what the world isn't
[45:10] isn't doing they cannot blame god for
[45:12] the condition they're in they've chosen
[45:15] the condition they're in
[45:17] and they're still choosing it to this
[45:20] day so this this book of ordinance that
[45:23] you have to realize
[45:25] goes is goes way further than than the
[45:29] law from mount sinai this book of
[45:32] ordinance is is as if it's a is as if
[45:36] it's a written certificate of death one
[45:39] commentator calls it a written
[45:41] certificate of death here in verse 14.
[45:43] look with me blotting out the
[45:45] handwriting of ordinances that was
[45:47] against us and so it's it's a it's a
[45:51] bill of indebtedness
[45:54] because you were born in sin
[45:56] so you were born
[45:58] in debt you understand so so so this
[46:02] this written code this law this law of
[46:06] sin and death the law that's against you
[46:09] is the day you eat
[46:10] that day you'll die and because that we
[46:13] come through that process the day you're
[46:15] born is the day you're headed for death
[46:18] and it's a law of ordinances it's a
[46:21] written code it's a certificate of debt
[46:24] it's a bill of indebtedness and and
[46:27] here's the problem people you're unable
[46:30] to pay it so that makes you a criminal
[46:34] because you can't pay it
[46:37] so now you're a criminal see and so
[46:40] literally what paul is showing here
[46:42] that jesus takes away the criminal
[46:45] charge how does he do it by paying the
[46:48] debt in his own death and he nails your
[46:51] death certificate to his cross and
[46:53] you're free today because christ paid
[46:57] the debt for you you're no longer a
[46:59] criminal unless you don't accept the
[47:00] pardon
[47:01] amen
[47:03] i don't want to be a criminal
[47:05] i don't want to be an outlaw from god i
[47:07] want to be a son of the king i want to
[47:10] be in fellowship with the holy spirit i
[47:12] accept the pardon for my life i accept
[47:15] that he ablotted out all my
[47:17] transgressions forgave all my sins and
[47:19] took the certificate of indebtedness and
[47:22] nailed it to his tree
[47:24] as if to say to the devil in the world i
[47:27] am paying this debt
[47:30] amen
[47:32] and
[47:33] i forget who i wish i had brother dale
[47:35] here to tell me
[47:36] the the the captain and the boys reading
[47:39] it to him
[47:40] you know when he says it it it you know
[47:42] it helps me my mom always taught me to
[47:45] read the bible like this the cabin boys
[47:46] reading it to the captain
[47:48] and he said you know
[47:50] uh i i took the sins and he put his name
[47:52] there and i was wounded for and he put
[47:55] his name there and i want to tell you
[47:57] something tonight jesus died at calvary
[47:59] for the sins of jason watkins
[48:02] jesus it canceled the debt he paid the
[48:05] debt that jason watkins owed hallelujah
[48:08] now you can't a devil can't nobody can
[48:11] it doesn't matter nobody can resettle me
[48:14] with that debt you know why because it's
[48:16] paid
[48:18] in full
[48:22] so we realized that he nailed it to his
[48:25] cross
[48:28] showing firmly
[48:30] that he has paid the debt all right now
[48:35] so when we begin to look at how that he
[48:39] disarmed he spoiled principalities and
[48:42] powers
[48:43] and he made a show of them openly
[48:47] you know when i look at the sad state of
[48:50] the world i said it to you already i'll
[48:52] say it again i am so ready for a
[48:55] millennium
[48:56] i just feel that way friends if i i
[48:59] think i could just stand up here tonight
[49:01] and this whole thought came upon me just
[49:02] like that i just thought lord this world
[49:04] is so gone it is so tortured it is so
[49:08] broken it is so smashed and there's such
[49:12] lies and deceit and it's coming from all
[49:14] corners and perversion and and people in
[49:18] in and i i even thought to myself that
[49:20] if if the if the
[49:22] if the majority i i can get why they
[49:25] don't like a certain man because of his
[49:26] bombastic egotistical ways i firmly get
[49:29] that i don't care about it myself but i
[49:31] get why people get put off by our
[49:34] president but but i thought to myself if
[49:36] the world could in majority
[49:39] vote for
[49:41] the stated
[49:43] platform
[49:44] of the other side and everything that
[49:47] they stand for the perversions and the
[49:50] filth i said to myself i'm not even sure
[49:53] how i'm going to even think about that
[49:55] to think that they would that they would
[49:58] not only you know oh and i don't want to
[50:00] get all into political issues i'm
[50:01] determined to stay out of that tonight
[50:03] because i frankly do not care like i
[50:05] said i voted for jesus he voted for me
[50:08] and we both won
[50:10] amen and i'm going to end up in heaven i
[50:12] get to live in heaven with him and it's
[50:14] all rigged election anyway so i'm just
[50:16] glad that i'm in christ
[50:20] but i just thought when i thought about
[50:21] the perversions that they that they're
[50:23] pushing for i just thought lord we need
[50:26] a millennium
[50:28] that's the answer that's what the world
[50:29] needs i'm going to tell you something
[50:31] friends where we're running out of
[50:32] answers we're running out of solutions
[50:34] and and and things are happening and
[50:37] dropping upon the world and you're
[50:38] facing them and i'm facing them and
[50:40] churches around the world and the world
[50:41] is falling apart out from underneath as
[50:43] i say even so lord jesus come quickly
[50:47] lord
[50:48] hallelujah
[50:50] i'm so ready for it what this world
[50:52] needs what this world needs is
[50:54] tomorrow's millennium today
[50:56] [Applause]
[50:58] they need it today they don't need a
[51:00] change uh you know they don't they
[51:02] didn't need an election they need a
[51:03] millennium
[51:05] they don't need another program they
[51:06] don't need another superstar they need a
[51:08] millennium
[51:10] hallelujah
[51:13] it would bring
[51:15] some much needed answers to these
[51:18] strange and unsettling times that we
[51:21] have around us
[51:23] you see it i see it we're not naive to
[51:25] it
[51:28] solutions that
[51:30] you know this constant i to me it just
[51:32] seems like a a a a drip of human
[51:36] problems
[51:37] just humanity is so beset by just a
[51:40] steady drip of problems
[51:43] and every day
[51:45] you know you say a drip's not going to
[51:46] be much put up put a pail under a drip
[51:49] and come back do it that morning come
[51:51] back that evening you've got gallons of
[51:52] water
[51:54] and if you don't check on it it'll
[51:55] overflow and then you've got to mess and
[51:57] it's all just a drip
[52:00] and that's where we are today it just
[52:02] seems like satan has
[52:04] has put the world in such a condition
[52:07] that you know we're hardly amazed
[52:09] anymore you're hardly shocked anymore
[52:12] things that would have stunned and left
[52:14] left people without even a way to get
[52:16] their mind wrapped around some of the
[52:18] things that are happening in the day and
[52:19] hour and and i get there's always been
[52:22] problems and sinners and sinful things
[52:23] and people and calamities and all kinds
[52:26] of i get there's been wars and rumors of
[52:27] wars and genocide i'm not talking about
[52:30] that
[52:31] i'm talking about what people are
[52:33] allowing as normal
[52:37] when you go back and want to say all the
[52:38] calamities of the world at least we were
[52:40] against it
[52:42] when you talk about all the filth and
[52:44] the vile of the world at least
[52:46] humanities took a stand and said that's
[52:48] wrong today that thinking is nothing's
[52:51] wrong
[52:52] everything is okay whatever you want to
[52:55] do it's perfectly fine there is no right
[52:57] and wrong oh we need a millennium amen
[53:01] i am so ready
[53:03] for
[53:04] a millennium it sure would solve a great
[53:07] many pressing situations
[53:09] that life has either
[53:13] i don't know
[53:14] recently hit you with
[53:16] hitting you right now
[53:18] or standing around a corner waiting for
[53:20] you to come around the corner
[53:24] the millennium is coming friends
[53:27] it's very real
[53:29] and it's going to be very great
[53:32] and i
[53:34] i want to be there
[53:35] amen amen
[53:38] i'm looking you in the eye and i'm just
[53:40] telling you straight up i want to be
[53:41] there
[53:43] i look at this world and it holds no
[53:44] charm for me
[53:46] there's nothing here to charm me anymore
[53:49] i look and think what a millennium is
[53:51] and what a world we're going to have and
[53:53] where we're going and the life and
[53:54] brother branham said we're going to life
[53:56] we're going to live
[53:58] think of it and think of a world right
[54:00] here
[54:02] not in alpha centauri right here
[54:05] right here on this earth we're not going
[54:07] to have to worry about a white house or
[54:09] a kremlin or a vatican there's going to
[54:11] be a royal city a royal palace a royal
[54:14] king whose law is going to cover the
[54:16] whole earth there's going to be one law
[54:18] there won't be no elections
[54:20] we won't need to have political parties
[54:22] running there's only going to be one
[54:24] party christ
[54:26] hallelujah there's going to be a family
[54:28] a royal family and that's you and that's
[54:31] me and what are we we're the executors
[54:33] we're the where we carry forth the
[54:35] justice of god around the whole world
[54:37] and that's just the beginning friends
[54:39] that's just
[54:40] a honeymoon what does the new heavens
[54:42] and the new oh i want to go i want i'm
[54:45] ready for it in my life i say lord god
[54:48] bring it upon us
[54:50] i want to see my before another
[54:52] generation i don't want to see another
[54:54] generation have to go through what our
[54:56] young people are facing today
[54:58] unimaginable indescribable would have
[55:00] been frankly unbelievable just a couple
[55:02] decades ago
[55:04] none of us would have believed it that's
[55:06] right amen
[55:11] what will it take
[55:14] to be there
[55:16] in this millennium what will it take
[55:18] to be there that really
[55:20] you have to kind of break that down in
[55:22] my opinion my humble opinion because
[55:24] that's really you have to ask two
[55:26] questions in that
[55:28] if you're going to say what will it take
[55:29] to be there i think that
[55:32] you have to make that into two questions
[55:34] number one what has it taken already
[55:38] and what will it take from here
[55:41] what has it taken two questions
[55:44] highly important questions now you all
[55:45] agree with me you want the millennium
[55:48] we want to go
[55:50] we want that world
[55:52] we want to be free of this
[55:54] of the drip
[55:56] drip drip of human misery that is the
[56:00] earth today and it doesn't even matter
[56:03] i i at our at the next time i'll give it
[56:06] to give a little tip off to the senior
[56:09] youth next time brother jason gathers
[56:10] you i got a plan i'm going to show you
[56:12] something i came across
[56:14] and uh i'm gonna show you
[56:16] faces that you'll recognize
[56:19] sports stars hollywood stars you know uh
[56:22] powerful people rich people with all the
[56:25] fortune and glory and big contracts and
[56:28] music stars and and and and and they're
[56:31] interviewing them
[56:33] and
[56:34] they've only got one question
[56:36] does your
[56:37] fame
[56:38] and money
[56:40] bring you happiness
[56:43] and without the exception of even a
[56:46] single one
[56:47] they all say no
[56:50] no
[56:52] the fame doesn't bring me happiness the
[56:54] money doesn't bring me happiness and
[56:57] some of them say the money can buy me
[56:59] pleasures
[57:00] the money can buy me a sale boat in the
[57:02] caribbean i can go i can go sail around
[57:04] the caribbean for half a year but when
[57:06] it's over then i'm back to my my
[57:07] depression now what do i do
[57:10] and finally you spend all your money
[57:11] doing everything there is to do that's
[57:13] fun and you don't even want to do it
[57:14] anymore because you realize your life is
[57:16] just an empty chasing of the wind
[57:19] and every one of them i'm talking about
[57:21] i'd start naming names right now even
[57:23] even even we recognize them star music
[57:26] stars sports stars movie stars famous
[57:29] people on the cutting edge red carpet
[57:31] people
[57:34] does your money make you happy no
[57:37] it can't money can't buy happiness all
[57:40] it can do is buy pleasures but it can't
[57:42] buy happiness
[57:44] and the bible warns of that
[57:47] that people who suffer
[57:49] who suffer you say you mean they're
[57:51] going to suffer the flames of hell that
[57:53] is
[57:54] that it that pales
[57:56] in comparison
[57:58] say something pales in comparison to the
[58:00] flames of hell yeah
[58:02] missing heaven
[58:05] don't try to tell me anything about hell
[58:08] burning i'm burning in the lake of fire
[58:10] that's nothing compared to the gnashing
[58:13] of teeth that people are going to have
[58:15] not because of where they're going but
[58:17] because of what they missed out on
[58:21] and it was right there and they could
[58:22] have had it and it was offered and it
[58:24] was free and god tried to give it to him
[58:26] and preachers tried to preach it to him
[58:28] and parents tried to pray it for him
[58:31] and they and they chose to not go into
[58:34] the millennium
[58:36] oh you're talking about a horror of
[58:39] horrors
[58:44] two very important questions
[58:48] if we say i want to be in the millennium
[58:50] what will it take to get there first we
[58:52] want to look at the first question first
[58:53] important question first monumental
[58:56] question what has it taken already
[58:59] amen
[59:00] and what will it take from here
[59:05] these are
[59:06] i would say that
[59:08] these are the
[59:10] two most important questions
[59:13] in creation
[59:16] what does it take to get
[59:19] to the millennium
[59:21] could you think of
[59:24] i i challenge any mortal
[59:26] to think of a question
[59:28] more important than that here there's a
[59:32] millennium great how do i get there
[59:35] listen close okay
[59:39] i'll promise you this friends
[59:44] the answer to that question is more than
[59:46] all the midnight oil
[59:48] these political parties have burned all
[59:50] night
[59:52] it's more important trying to figure out
[59:54] who's in who's out and who's got
[59:57] i don't need an election to tell me
[59:59] who's got all power in heaven and earth
[1:00:01] i already know who has all power in
[1:00:04] heaven and earth i don't need an
[1:00:05] election to tell me who's in power i
[1:00:07] already know who's in power
[1:00:10] amen
[1:00:11] all of america
[1:00:15] trying to deal with the worry and the
[1:00:17] stress i i
[1:00:19] i'm just
[1:00:20] just what i didn't even i i i looked at
[1:00:24] it off and on just a little bit seeing
[1:00:26] who it was thinking well it looks like
[1:00:28] it's going to go this way and before
[1:00:29] long now it's going that way and that's
[1:00:30] way maybe it's back this way well no not
[1:00:32] it's going to and they don't even know
[1:00:34] and now the lawyers are in it and
[1:00:35] they're already in the courts they don't
[1:00:37] even have an answer
[1:00:38] amen
[1:00:39] they don't even have an answer what
[1:00:41] folly if your life was given to that
[1:00:44] what life would you have can you imagine
[1:00:46] that people dedicate their entire human
[1:00:49] existence
[1:00:51] to that
[1:00:52] one night in november
[1:00:55] everything hinges on that and they're
[1:00:57] not even realizing there's a millennium
[1:01:00] coming
[1:01:01] that is gonna
[1:01:02] it's gonna so make this world seem like
[1:01:05] nothing oh friends young people old
[1:01:08] people married single don't get your
[1:01:10] eyes don't be deceived by vain
[1:01:12] philosophy and imagination that's what
[1:01:15] paul's saying you've been born of god
[1:01:16] you're children of the kingdom
[1:01:21] all of america i thought about all the
[1:01:24] alka-seltzers and
[1:01:25] antacids that they're taking my goodness
[1:01:29] all the whiskey that's getting drank
[1:01:31] drinking drinking their sorrows and
[1:01:34] and you know all the worry and all the
[1:01:36] stress of bad news politically because
[1:01:39] there were no clear winners and so both
[1:01:42] sides seem to have won some and both
[1:01:44] sides seem to have lost some they don't
[1:01:46] have all the answers even still and
[1:01:48] nobody even knows and there there seems
[1:01:50] to be some good news to

[1:05:04] how you got here here's how it happened
[1:05:06] when you came to christ
[1:05:09] you were circumcised but not by a
[1:05:11] physical procedure
[1:05:13] christ performed a spiritual
[1:05:16] circumcision
[1:05:17] the cutting away of your
[1:05:19] sinful nature for you were buried with
[1:05:23] christ when you were baptized and with
[1:05:27] him you were raised to new life because
[1:05:30] you trusted the mighty power of god who
[1:05:34] raised christ from the dead verse 13 can
[1:05:38] it get any better you were dead because
[1:05:41] of your sins and because of your sinful
[1:05:44] nature was was not yet cut away then god
[1:05:49] made you alive
[1:05:50] with christ isn't that wonderful
[1:05:53] but wait it gets better for he forgave
[1:05:57] all your sins and he canceled all of the
[1:06:02] record of charges against us and took it
[1:06:05] away
[1:06:07] by nailing it to his cross
[1:06:11] i don't have a mixed political message
[1:06:13] for you tonight i got all good news how
[1:06:16] did i get on this road to the millennium
[1:06:18] that's how
[1:06:20] it's christ did this for you and you
[1:06:22] have you have become a new creation
[1:06:26] in christ jesus
[1:06:28] back to the kjv brother kevin for verse
[1:06:31] 15.
[1:06:34] having spoiled
[1:06:36] principalities and powers
[1:06:39] he made a show of them openly this is a
[1:06:42] beautiful concept
[1:06:43] he made a show of them openly
[1:06:47] triumphing
[1:06:48] over them
[1:06:50] you know
[1:06:53] what jesus did at calvary
[1:06:56] uh
[1:06:58] he didn't just
[1:07:01] wake up on
[1:07:02] friday and go accomplish it
[1:07:05] jesus had lived a whole life back of
[1:07:07] that friday
[1:07:09] jesus had had had came to john in the
[1:07:12] water
[1:07:14] and john had been telling the people
[1:07:16] all this time i don't know who he is i
[1:07:18] don't know where he is but i know he's
[1:07:20] here
[1:07:21] well how do you know john cause i'm here
[1:07:24] and he sent me to introduce him so i
[1:07:26] know if i'm here he's here
[1:07:29] and all we got to do is wait for the
[1:07:31] appointed hour and the father who sent
[1:07:33] me will reveal him and i have a secret
[1:07:35] i'm going to tell you but i'll know him
[1:07:38] i'll know him when i see him because the
[1:07:40] one who sent me told me how to identify
[1:07:42] him
[1:07:43] and so when john saw him he was able to
[1:07:46] identify him according to the word that
[1:07:47] came to him from god that's how you
[1:07:49] always identify identified by the word
[1:07:53] and so we realize that
[1:07:55] that that that jesus
[1:07:58] when he
[1:08:00] spoiled
[1:08:01] principalities
[1:08:03] and powers
[1:08:04] he made a show of them openly triumphing
[1:08:08] over them you have to understand friends
[1:08:10] that evil powers
[1:08:12] had dogged him his whole life
[1:08:17] evil powers
[1:08:18] who were afraid of him
[1:08:20] tried to have him killed as a child amen
[1:08:24] and would have succeeded
[1:08:26] but god anoints his anoints his
[1:08:29] caretaker joseph and says take the child
[1:08:32] and flee to egypt because they seek his
[1:08:33] life
[1:08:35] and so here hear from a baby
[1:08:39] i mean he can't even hardly find a place
[1:08:42] to be born
[1:08:44] you're saying oh i've been dog the
[1:08:46] devil's dog to me all my life the devil
[1:08:47] was dogging the lord jesus when he was
[1:08:50] still in the womb
[1:08:52] couldn't even find a place to have a
[1:08:55] child no clean sanitary place you
[1:08:57] realize all the complications that were
[1:09:00] now going to be possible in a childbirth
[1:09:02] if god doesn't come on the scene he's
[1:09:04] going to be born in an animal stall
[1:09:08] an animal stall stinking animal stall in
[1:09:11] the middle of the night
[1:09:15] he's born in a manger
[1:09:17] they seek his life from a child father
[1:09:20] has to run with him to egypt and all of
[1:09:23] his life now he's struggling
[1:09:25] because evil powers are struggling with
[1:09:29] him all along you know trying throughout
[1:09:32] his entire ministry what are they what
[1:09:34] is the devil trying to do he's trying
[1:09:37] his best to get him to abandon the path
[1:09:40] of the cross
[1:09:42] now if he had been successful we
[1:09:45] wouldn't be preaching about a millennium
[1:09:47] tonight
[1:09:48] and you just might as well go and figure
[1:09:50] out who you want as a political party
[1:09:52] eat drink and be merry for tomorrow we
[1:09:55] all die and life ain't worth anything
[1:09:57] anyhow but i'm here to tell you the
[1:09:59] devil did not succeed and he made it to
[1:10:02] calvary and there he spoiled
[1:10:05] principalities
[1:10:09] and because he did because he lives
[1:10:12] i can face tomorrow
[1:10:16] the devil tempted him we're not going to
[1:10:18] take the time to read it i'm going to
[1:10:19] run out of time fat run out of time
[1:10:21] quick
[1:10:22] but you can make a note of it in luke
[1:10:24] chapter 4 those first 13 verses you know
[1:10:27] the story from sunday school
[1:10:30] the devil takes him into the wilderness
[1:10:32] and
[1:10:33] you know here he is fasting 40 days and
[1:10:36] he's hungry and he was hungry he was a
[1:10:37] man he says here's stones turn them into
[1:10:40] bread you've got power to do that and he
[1:10:42] did have power to do that
[1:10:44] now
[1:10:45] you you think about this for a minute
[1:10:49] think about
[1:10:50] having the power to do it
[1:10:52] and on purpose not using it
[1:10:54] amen
[1:10:56] amen do you know he only had a single
[1:10:59] reason
[1:11:01] he had a single reason
[1:11:02] for not turning that stone into bread
[1:11:05] which would have pretty much just
[1:11:07] slapped the devil in the face and shut
[1:11:08] him up
[1:11:10] he could just turn it to bread and then
[1:11:12] ate it and been hungry
[1:11:14] and been and been filled
[1:11:17] brother brown says
[1:11:18] he could have done it he had the power
[1:11:20] to do it but he didn't want to use his
[1:11:25] great power
[1:11:27] so that when
[1:11:28] his family
[1:11:30] when you came into the temptation of the
[1:11:32] devil you would realize you don't need
[1:11:35] some supernatural power all you got to
[1:11:38] do is do what jesus did you have the
[1:11:41] same weapon the same access and the same
[1:11:45] authority as the son of god to say it is
[1:11:49] written
[1:11:50] say well that's not a very powerful
[1:11:52] weapon it beat the devil
[1:11:55] it'll beat him every time
[1:11:57] he takes him up on a on a on a on a high
[1:12:00] mountain you know takes him up on the on
[1:12:02] the tabernacle throw on the temple throw
[1:12:04] yourself off
[1:12:06] because it's written now now the devil's
[1:12:08] playing the game oh i can do this think
[1:12:10] you can quote the scripture to me i can
[1:12:11] quote it to you too it's written he'll
[1:12:13] give his angels the devil had read
[1:12:15] psalms he knew what david had said
[1:12:17] he'll give his angels charge over you so
[1:12:19] go ahead
[1:12:20] you know and what does jesus do jesus
[1:12:23] takes him right to the word again
[1:12:25] defeats him with the word again does it
[1:12:26] use his great power
[1:12:28] could have jumped off
[1:12:30] could have floated to the ground
[1:12:33] but that would have completely messed up
[1:12:34] god's plan and jesus didn't want to do
[1:12:36] that so that he could show you that no
[1:12:39] matter what kind of temptation you run
[1:12:41] into you can win it
[1:12:44] you just by the word alone and nothing
[1:12:47] else just your faith in god's word amen
[1:12:53] he takes him in
[1:12:54] and and to a high mountain shows him all
[1:12:57] the kingdoms of the world showed him
[1:12:59] every kingdom in its glory
[1:13:02] showed him the united states in its
[1:13:04] glory showed him europe showed him all
[1:13:07] the countries in their in their pinnacle
[1:13:09] in their glory in their in their zenith
[1:13:12] and said they're every one mind they're
[1:13:14] given under my charge and jesus never
[1:13:15] debated that with him
[1:13:18] because he knew it was true
[1:13:20] but brother ram says jesus knew that it
[1:13:22] wouldn't matter because he would fall
[1:13:24] heir to it anyway
[1:13:26] and he wasn't going to take the devil's
[1:13:28] shortcut listen friends don't take the
[1:13:31] devil's shortcut pleasures for a season
[1:13:34] because that's what he wants you to do
[1:13:36] he wants you to take pleasures for a
[1:13:37] season and trade the millennium trade
[1:13:40] the new heavens and the new earth trade
[1:13:41] all of eternity don't take the deal
[1:13:44] that's a horrible deal it wouldn't
[1:13:47] matter if you had all the money and
[1:13:48] fortune and glory and fame in the world
[1:13:51] i've already can prove to you that
[1:13:53] fortune and glory and money and fame
[1:13:55] cannot buy you happiness
[1:13:58] because there's only one form of
[1:13:59] happiness and the devil ain't got it he
[1:14:02] ain't a happy camper there's only one
[1:14:05] form of real joy and that's that in that
[1:14:08] fountain back in the eternities that was
[1:14:10] a fountain of love and brother ben said
[1:14:12] out of that fountain came joy and peace
[1:14:15] and happiness out of that fountain came
[1:14:18] mercy and grace in our lives and that's
[1:14:21] what jesus was choosing
[1:14:25] and here he is i mean he he's got a you
[1:14:28] know the devil is so strongly
[1:14:30] all through his ministry
[1:14:33] trying to force him to abandon the
[1:14:36] pathway to the cross which is why
[1:14:39] you're here in line for a millennium
[1:14:41] amen
[1:14:42] amen
[1:14:44] say yeah the devil it ain't always the
[1:14:46] devil
[1:14:48] you know
[1:14:49] if we go to matthew 16 let's let's get
[1:14:51] that one kevin matthew 16
[1:14:53] 21-21-23 now watch this one
[1:14:56] here's his own family
[1:14:58] trying their level best
[1:15:00] to stop him
[1:15:03] his own disciples
[1:15:05] from that time forth verse 21 from that
[1:15:08] time forth began jesus to show unto his
[1:15:10] disciples how that he must go into
[1:15:12] jerusalem and suffer many things of the
[1:15:14] elders and the chief priests and scribes
[1:15:16] and be killed and raised again on the
[1:15:17] third day then peter took him began to
[1:15:19] rebuke him said be it far from the lord
[1:15:22] this shall not be unto thee and he
[1:15:25] turned verse 23 and said unto peter get
[1:15:28] thee behind me satan
[1:15:30] thou art an offense unto me for thou
[1:15:33] savrus not the things that be of god
[1:15:36] but those that be of men and that's
[1:15:39] really where every human being has to
[1:15:41] answer the question do i savor the
[1:15:43] things of god or the things of men
[1:15:46] now let me tell you something understand
[1:15:48] that if he savored the things of god
[1:15:51] he's going to he's going to uh suffer
[1:15:55] many things of the elders and the chief
[1:15:58] priests and scribes he's going to be
[1:15:59] killed he's going to die a
[1:16:02] torture death that's if he savored the
[1:16:05] things of god it didn't mean he was
[1:16:06] going on a picnic
[1:16:08] but he knew better than just but peter
[1:16:11] now is savoring the things of man
[1:16:13] because because it here that jesus is
[1:16:16] once again having to work through his
[1:16:18] own family
[1:16:20] you've been there i've been there we've
[1:16:21] had this trial or that trial this friend
[1:16:23] or that friend this family that family
[1:16:25] that this person that person what is it
[1:16:28] i'm here to tell you it's the devil
[1:16:29] trying every way he can to stop you from
[1:16:32] going to calvary to stop you from
[1:16:35] choosing god's will for your life
[1:16:39] trying to take you out of the path
[1:16:43] verse 24
[1:16:45] then said jesus unto his disciples here
[1:16:47] it is here's the secret
[1:16:49] if any man will come after me
[1:16:52] let him deny himself
[1:16:54] and take up his cross
[1:16:56] and follow
[1:17:00] me satan trying to catch him in the
[1:17:03] garden luke 22 52-53 i'm hurrying
[1:17:08] luke 22 52
[1:17:11] then said then jesus said unto the chief
[1:17:14] priests and captains of the temple and
[1:17:15] the elders
[1:17:17] which came to him
[1:17:19] be you come out
[1:17:20] as against a thief with swords and
[1:17:22] staves
[1:17:24] when i was daily with you in the temple
[1:17:26] you stretched forth no hands against me
[1:17:29] but this is your hour
[1:17:30] and the power
[1:17:32] of darkness
[1:17:35] you have to understand friends that at
[1:17:37] calvary
[1:17:39] jesus ridded himself
[1:17:41] at the cross
[1:17:43] he literally ridded himself of all of
[1:17:46] these strains
[1:17:48] that were trying to pull him out of the
[1:17:50] path for god that god had for his life
[1:17:53] he at calvary when what we read i read
[1:17:56] you a minute ago out of the uh what
[1:17:58] christ did for you at calvary and
[1:18:00] spoiled principalities and disarmed it
[1:18:02] and nailed the ordinances nailed your
[1:18:04] sins to a tree forgave all of your
[1:18:06] trespasses made you a new creation in
[1:18:08] christ jesus delivered you
[1:18:11] from death
[1:18:12] joined you back to god who you were
[1:18:14] separated from and now has separated you
[1:18:17] from the world and puts you on the path
[1:18:18] to the millennium
[1:18:20] but but his entire life they're trying
[1:18:23] to stop him trying to turn him trying to
[1:18:25] pull him trying to prevent him trying to
[1:18:27] hinder him i'm here to tell you that at
[1:18:29] calvary he ridded himself of anything
[1:18:33] that would keep him from saving you
[1:18:36] amen
[1:18:39] he stripped himself he divested himself
[1:18:44] himself he did it
[1:18:46] willingly divested anything
[1:18:50] that would hinder him in any way
[1:18:54] from getting you to the millennium
[1:18:58] and that is how you got to where
[1:19:01] you are today
[1:19:03] verse 15 he made a show
[1:19:06] i love this back to colossians 2 he made
[1:19:09] a show of them openly now this public
[1:19:12] display this is interesting i want to
[1:19:14] deal with this a minute there it is
[1:19:15] having spoiled principalities and powers
[1:19:18] he made a show of them openly triumphing
[1:19:22] triumphing over them in it
[1:19:25] so this display then now
[1:19:28] is is literally
[1:19:30] where
[1:19:31] how would i say it this is where
[1:19:34] jesus is literally going to
[1:19:39] strip away
[1:19:40] from satan
[1:19:43] every claim that he had on you
[1:19:48] ever all the claim all of satan's hold
[1:19:53] on humanity all the evil powers that
[1:19:56] when jesus died that horribly
[1:20:00] it tortures embarrassing
[1:20:03] humiliating uh rejected of all men
[1:20:07] rejected even of god
[1:20:10] when he did that he literally the bible
[1:20:13] says he made a show of them openly in
[1:20:16] other words he went there in such a way
[1:20:20] so that he would be able to remove any
[1:20:23] claim in arrears today satan because
[1:20:26] jesus was faithful at calvary because he
[1:20:28] got you on the path for the millennium
[1:20:30] there's nothing satan can do to take you
[1:20:32] off of it there's nothing he can do it's
[1:20:34] not like today where you know they think
[1:20:36] they've got a certain amount of votes
[1:20:38] and then somebody goes in the back room
[1:20:39] and they pull out all these tens of
[1:20:40] thousands oh we got all these to count
[1:20:42] to and suddenly now it's going the other
[1:20:44] direction don't worry don't worry
[1:20:47] nobody's going to come out of a closet
[1:20:49] with all kinds of your sins and your
[1:20:51] failures it was all met at calvary and
[1:20:53] jesus openly
[1:20:56] took away the claim of the devil
[1:20:58] now there's no claim he can ever have on
[1:21:01] you
[1:21:03] that display
[1:21:06] was such a way now i i i want you to
[1:21:09] absorb this for a minute
[1:21:11] because this this display as he
[1:21:14] the the the image of one that was so
[1:21:18] low
[1:21:19] i mean
[1:21:21] you
[1:21:24] you know it's the lord
[1:21:26] amen so to you
[1:21:27] it's all glorious
[1:21:30] amen
[1:21:31] you you you if you sit here
[1:21:34] and you bring the image of christ at
[1:21:36] calvary in your mind's eye
[1:21:38] you see a lovely lord jesus dying for
[1:21:41] your sins
[1:21:42] amen
[1:21:44] but that's not the image
[1:21:47] god was determined to show
[1:21:52] the image
[1:21:53] that god was going to show
[1:21:56] was judgment
[1:21:58] on the most
[1:22:00] low
[1:22:01] down
[1:22:02] filthy twisted perverted
[1:22:05] human being
[1:22:07] that had ever
[1:22:09] lived in the earth
[1:22:12] see
[1:22:13] the lord jesus was never guilty of any
[1:22:15] of that stuff correct
[1:22:17] that's what makes it so wonderful
[1:22:20] he who knew no sin
[1:22:22] became sin he didn't just become sin he
[1:22:26] became
[1:22:27] all your sin
[1:22:29] all combined of all the earth in all the
[1:22:34] ages of all through time his entire
[1:22:38] family
[1:22:39] everything they would ever do every
[1:22:42] mistake they would ever make me you them
[1:22:45] prophets priests king people didn't
[1:22:47] matter
[1:22:48] all of that was brought in one horrible
[1:22:52] one horrible mass of ugly putrified sin
[1:22:58] and was placed on a single man
[1:23:04] and the very the very imagery
[1:23:08] the very imagery that this man i mean
[1:23:10] let's imagine that you don't know who it
[1:23:11] is and you're coming up here's what
[1:23:13] you're going to see you're going to see
[1:23:15] a man first of all he's being crucified
[1:23:18] he's being murdered he's being he's
[1:23:20] being executed so obviously
[1:23:22] rome and israel don't execute good
[1:23:25] people
[1:23:26] so right away you know wow they're not
[1:23:29] just got this guy in jail they're
[1:23:31] actually killing him he must be
[1:23:34] extremely
[1:23:36] evil
[1:23:38] they stripped him naked didn't even give
[1:23:41] him the
[1:23:42] the decency to die clothed
[1:23:46] he he wasn't just dying as an execution
[1:23:50] he was dying having been tortured now
[1:23:53] imagine the casual observer who doesn't
[1:23:55] know who he is and sees this man what do
[1:23:57] you think he's going to think of this
[1:23:58] guy
[1:23:59] wow
[1:24:00] this guy you never know who this is no
[1:24:03] but he must really be one bad person
[1:24:06] because not only has rome decided to
[1:24:09] kill him
[1:24:10] israel decided to kill him
[1:24:12] they literally lacerated his body so bad
[1:24:16] brother branham said he didn't even look
[1:24:18] like a human being
[1:24:22] now you just imagine for a minute put
[1:24:24] yourself there you don't know who it is
[1:24:26] but you're seeing this image
[1:24:28] this image here's some man he's under a
[1:24:32] death sentence by two nations he's been
[1:24:35] stripped of all of his clothes he's
[1:24:37] hanging embarrassed and naked in front
[1:24:39] of the whole world he's lacerated and
[1:24:42] cut and and and even his bones he's cut
[1:24:45] so deeply in his flesh his bones are
[1:24:48] showing
[1:24:49] amen
[1:24:51] they're mocked they're not just killing
[1:24:52] him they're not just torturing him
[1:24:54] they're not just embarrassing him but
[1:24:56] then they're even mocking him and they
[1:24:58] put a crown of thorns down into his
[1:25:00] skull i mean if i don't know who this is
[1:25:03] i'm standing there going wow
[1:25:06] this guy must have really really really
[1:25:10] been nasty
[1:25:13] and then not only that but somebody
[1:25:15] walks up and says you think that's
[1:25:17] something
[1:25:19] the bible says
[1:25:20] god's word says
[1:25:22] cursed is any man who hangs on a tree
[1:25:28] now you're looking at a man
[1:25:31] who's got a double death sentence by two
[1:25:34] nations he's beaten and lacerated till
[1:25:36] his bones are showing and blood is
[1:25:38] gushing he's got thorns crushed in his
[1:25:39] head they're mocking him and spitting at
[1:25:41] him and reviling him they can't even let
[1:25:44] the man die in peace that's how horrible
[1:25:47] this image is he's being hung on a tree
[1:25:50] and the bible god's word says that if a
[1:25:53] man does that he's even cursed of god so
[1:25:56] now he's not discursed of rome he's not
[1:25:58] discursed of israel he's not just
[1:26:00] humiliated he's not just tortured he's
[1:26:02] not just executed he's cursed of god and
[1:26:05] now the sun won't shine and it goes dark
[1:26:08] in the middle of the day and all nature
[1:26:09] and even god runs away and here's this
[1:26:12] poor man
[1:26:15] you're talking about the imagery
[1:26:18] we're talking about the imagery of the
[1:26:21] most horrible person that you could ever
[1:26:24] imagine all the sin of all the people of
[1:26:28] all the ages placed on one individual
[1:26:31] and he's so cursed
[1:26:33] he's so condemned he's so judged that
[1:26:36] even brother branham says
[1:26:39] god
[1:26:40] judged him a sinner and sent him to hell
[1:26:43] and he just didn't send him to hell he
[1:26:45] seemed held tortured sent him to hell
[1:26:46] naked sent him to hell beaten sent him
[1:26:48] to hell crucified sitting to hell
[1:26:51] hung on a tree
[1:26:54] why
[1:26:56] is this imagery so important why does
[1:26:59] god gotta go so
[1:27:02] over the top beyond all sensibility
[1:27:05] beyond all reason why couldn't he just
[1:27:08] lay down and give up the ghost i will
[1:27:10] tell you why this imagery is the worst
[1:27:14] imagery of any man who ever lived who
[1:27:17] died who was ever killed nobody ever
[1:27:20] died of death like this and the the
[1:27:22] imagery is such that that you can come
[1:27:25] into this service tonight and i can say
[1:27:27] to you that i don't care what kind of a
[1:27:30] life you have ever lived i don't care
[1:27:32] what kind of guilt might be upon your
[1:27:34] mind i'm here to tell you that the image
[1:27:37] of your sacrifice was so much worse than
[1:27:40] you could ever imagine you to be i'm
[1:27:43] here to tell you according to him you
[1:27:45] look like a saint of god
[1:27:49] and this is the imagery that god has
[1:27:52] allowed he because he's got to break the
[1:27:56] claim he's going to break the hold on
[1:27:59] satan the hold that satan had on
[1:28:02] humanity for 4 000 years and now you sit
[1:28:06] here today friends how did you get to
[1:28:08] here how did you get on the road to the
[1:28:10] millennium how are you going into a
[1:28:12] millennium because somebody
[1:28:14] came down and i don't care how bad you
[1:28:17] are and i don't care how bad you've been
[1:28:19] and i don't care what mistake you make
[1:28:21] you're free in christ you're clean in
[1:28:24] christ you're redeemed in christ you're
[1:28:26] restored in christ and there's nothing
[1:28:28] you could ever do to look so bad in the
[1:28:31] image of god as the lord jesus christ
[1:28:34] appeared in the image of god
[1:28:37] hallelujah
[1:28:39] because now
[1:28:41] that same one who they
[1:28:43] gave a double execution sentence to two
[1:28:45] nations said he had to die
[1:28:48] the same one who they lacerated and
[1:28:50] tortured and killed the same one who
[1:28:52] they spit and mocked and crowned his
[1:28:54] head with thorns and plucked out his
[1:28:56] beard and railed upon him and humiliated
[1:28:58] him
[1:29:00] that same one
[1:29:02] now stands
[1:29:04] as my advocate
[1:29:06] that same one
[1:29:07] who win that filthy greasy devil tries
[1:29:11] to come up before the throne of god and
[1:29:13] tries to accuse you or tries to accuse
[1:29:16] me and i'm here to tell you he might
[1:29:18] have the goods he might have video
[1:29:20] replay he might have your fingerprints
[1:29:22] he might have your dna and he's standing
[1:29:25] there holding the evidence of your own
[1:29:27] filth in the presence of god but but
[1:29:30] this one who was tortured steps between
[1:29:33] you and the accuser and says father he
[1:29:36] is me and the father says well
[1:29:39] if he is you then he is innocent
[1:29:42] hallelujah friends and that's why we're
[1:29:44] on a road to a millennium tonight
[1:29:47] because i'm innocent not because i was
[1:29:49] good but because he nailed all of the
[1:29:53] book of ordinances that was against me
[1:29:55] he nailed it to his tree and i'm on the
[1:29:58] road for a millennium i can hope for a
[1:30:00] millennium i can speak about a
[1:30:02] millennium i don't have to be bound to
[1:30:04] this world
[1:30:06] i can say let them have it
[1:30:09] let them have it they can elect whoever
[1:30:11] they want to elect i don't even care
[1:30:13] just give me the millennium give me god
[1:30:16] give me christ give me that life i'm
[1:30:18] done with this world i want that purity
[1:30:22] i want that holiness
[1:30:26] we're on our road friends we're on our
[1:30:28] way
[1:30:29] bank on it you're on your way you're
[1:30:32] marching to zion beautiful beautiful
[1:30:35] zion
[1:30:38] satan would try to
[1:30:40] make you disbelieve it all and tell you
[1:30:42] there's
[1:30:43] there's no way for you to get there
[1:30:46] you know i i was preaching here i don't
[1:30:49] remember
[1:30:50] what several services ago about
[1:30:53] jerusalem
[1:30:55] the mother of us all
[1:30:57] you know brother brandon makes a
[1:30:58] statement i don't think i
[1:31:00] don't know if i put it down
[1:31:03] i did oh i did 1965
[1:31:06] trying to do god's service without it
[1:31:08] being
[1:31:09] god's will
[1:31:12] i'm going to close with this
[1:31:15] right near the end of his life
[1:31:17] november 27th
[1:31:20] he's got
[1:31:22] less than
[1:31:23] a month
[1:31:24] the seventh angel
[1:31:26] the seventh star
[1:31:27] the last one
[1:31:29] he's been deployed
[1:31:30] he's he's had a 33-year ministry
[1:31:33] he's coming down to the end
[1:31:35] and before he
[1:31:37] checks out
[1:31:39] and heads to a reward
[1:31:41] way sooner than any of us thought he
[1:31:42] should have amen
[1:31:46] he comes to the pulpit
[1:31:48] and he says abraham
[1:31:52] sought for a city
[1:31:54] on the earth
[1:31:55] you know
[1:31:56] he was looking for it
[1:31:58] because he was going to live there
[1:32:00] someday
[1:32:01] abraham is in that city
[1:32:04] and he went around looking for it
[1:32:07] now brother brahm said the reason he was
[1:32:09] looking for it he knew
[1:32:11] it had to be somewhere
[1:32:13] because he had already met its king
[1:32:15] so he knew this ain't a pipe dream
[1:32:18] this isn't somebody you know it wrote a
[1:32:20] book a fiction
[1:32:21] you know x actually never marks the spot
[1:32:24] archaeologists will tell you at least
[1:32:26] indiana jones will tell you that
[1:32:30] but he knew he had met its king and
[1:32:32] brother brahm says
[1:32:34] he went around looking for it
[1:32:37] and right on the same grounds where he
[1:32:40] looked
[1:32:43] it was just above him
[1:32:45] it was just above him
[1:32:47] he'll return and we'll return in the
[1:32:49] millennium and he'll live in that city
[1:32:52] but being a prophet
[1:32:54] he was ordained and inspired he knowed
[1:32:56] watch he know there was a city somewhere
[1:33:00] and he was looking for it but you see
[1:33:02] the whole revelation of it was hid from
[1:33:05] him
[1:33:06] it wasn't for his age
[1:33:09] on down to john where he saw it coming
[1:33:12] down from god out of heaven that was the
[1:33:14] city now john
[1:33:16] writing the book of revelation that's
[1:33:18] our book that's this day
[1:33:21] to abraham
[1:33:22] it was hid from him
[1:33:24] it was just above him he was searching
[1:33:26] everywhere for it he knew it was real
[1:33:29] but the revelation of it was hindered
[1:33:32] from him i'm here to tell you something
[1:33:33] friends
[1:33:35] jerusalem
[1:33:36] is the mother of us all
[1:33:39] that you know why you know it says that
[1:33:41] because that's where i came from
[1:33:42] jerusalem bore me jerusalem is the city
[1:33:45] of the great king jerusalem is just like
[1:33:47] the earth it's an eternal attribute of
[1:33:49] god this white's eternal could never
[1:33:50] pass away
[1:33:51] jerusalem is an expression of god
[1:33:53] jerusalem above
[1:33:55] jerusalem above mount zion all of these
[1:33:58] types speaking of the bride john sees
[1:33:59] the city he's going to he says i'll show
[1:34:01] you the bride the lamb's wife he sees
[1:34:03] the city
[1:34:05] in the city it's 12 it's all these names
[1:34:08] known of god no way to ever get them
[1:34:10] taken off you only take something from
[1:34:11] friends it didn't matter all of those
[1:34:13] patriarchs all down through the old
[1:34:14] testament did some heinous horrible
[1:34:16] things you know what their names are
[1:34:18] still in that wall
[1:34:20] their names are still in that wall
[1:34:22] hallelujah there's no way to stop it
[1:34:25] because i came from there i'm a part of
[1:34:28] that that's why brother branham said not
[1:34:30] not one time has it ever missed this is
[1:34:32] events made clear in prophecy not one
[1:34:34] time has it ever missed and it won't for
[1:34:36] who are predestinated to see it will see
[1:34:39] it jesus said no man can come except my
[1:34:41] father draws him and all the fathers
[1:34:43] giving me will come it's the word
[1:34:45] joining with the word it can't do
[1:34:48] nothing else how do i get there from
[1:34:51] here i've already told you how we got
[1:34:53] here already how do i get from here to
[1:34:55] there by walking in the word let the
[1:34:57] word be anointed because it's the word

[1:35:04] to go there so bad i'm a part of it i
[1:35:06] came from there
[1:35:08] this world is alien to me i can't get

[1:35:20] new world
[1:35:22] he sent me a word
[1:35:24] and that word will carry me all the way

[1:35:28] word brother branham said

[1:42:43] then um i want you to pray for sister
[1:42:45] debbie you know she i i want to just
[1:42:48] give just a brief explanation
[1:42:50] the lord has done so much for it thank
[1:42:51] you for your prayers she's
[1:42:53] you know probably 95 to 98 percent
[1:42:56] completely recovered she really came to
[1:42:58] the edge of a nervous collapse actually
[1:43:02] some things going on in in her mom and
[1:43:04] dad's health and it caused a lot of a
[1:43:06] lot of sudden
[1:43:08] stress upon her and tipped her over the
[1:43:10] edge
[1:43:11] but thank the lord for
[1:43:13] discerning doctors who was was able to
[1:43:16] diagnose it correctly when all the other
[1:43:18] specialists when all the other
[1:43:19] specialists were running crazy everybody
[1:43:22] had a surgery for or another thing or
[1:43:24] another thing or another thing or
[1:43:26] another thing and uh brother arvin said
[1:43:28] there's nothing wrong with her but her
[1:43:29] nerves
[1:43:30] and i was like what yeah it's just her
[1:43:32] nerves every bit of it's driven by her
[1:43:34] nerves she's having a breakdown
[1:43:36] and we managed to get her some
[1:43:37] medication for it very small dose
[1:43:40] whammo almost overnight
[1:43:42] just shows you the devil i'll tell you
[1:43:43] something friends mind is a powerful
[1:43:45] thing
[1:43:46] and the lord now has brought her almost
[1:43:48] completely out she's even been scaling
[1:43:50] back different medications looking to go
[1:43:52] off all of it trusting the lord and has
[1:43:55] made tremendous strides
[1:43:57] so
[1:43:58] she's not here on wednesdays for now
[1:44:00] because and only for one single reason
[1:44:03] because the last thing that's not yet
[1:44:05] recovered is her sleep cycle
[1:44:07] and if she doesn't sleep then the next
[1:44:09] day she's off the rails and so
[1:44:12] because that
[1:44:13] we literally they have a routine in our
[1:44:15] house everything has to start going dim
[1:44:16] we have all all devices and lights have
[1:44:19] the amber light we take out the blue
[1:44:20] light now everything has to start
[1:44:22] powering down i'm powering down i have
[1:44:24] to walk i have to speak softly not cut
[1:44:26] lights on which so that way she can
[1:44:28] slowly she gets in the bed at 7 30 and
[1:44:31] she's trying to fall asleep by 8 o'clock
[1:44:33] if she doesn't do that then she steps up
[1:44:35] all night you know she'll go to sleep
[1:44:37] she'll wake up and she'll go back sleep
[1:44:38] then she'll wake up and so the problem
[1:44:41] with the wednesday night is is if i
[1:44:42] bring her then her s that whole cycle is
[1:44:45] thrown completely out the window and she
[1:44:48] doesn't get home until after nine nine
[1:44:49] thirty she hasn't had the
[1:44:52] the slow down and so
[1:44:54] just pray because i she wants to be here
[1:44:56] so bad and uh that's why when you see
[1:44:59] her on the weekends she looks so
[1:45:00] wonderful because she is she's doing
[1:45:02] excellent she's just doing excellent and
[1:45:05] so uh i i appreciate man we had you know
[1:45:08] not just brother arvin doc meredith and
[1:45:10] doc andrew and all three of them
[1:45:13] they were the three musketeers for the
[1:45:15] pastor's wife and so i appreciate it
[1:45:18] they

[1:45:30] god bless our caregivers i'm glad we've
[1:45:33] got them you all have benefited from
[1:45:35] them how many hours in the middle of the
[1:45:37] night uh brother andrew and sister
[1:45:38] meredith have taken calls and brother
[1:45:40] harvin just to help just to help
[1:45:41] somebody so i sure appreciate god's
[1:45:45] mercy in all of this and uh but that's
[1:45:48] why she's not making it on wednesday
[1:45:50] nights because we've got a it's so
[1:45:52] important right now
[1:45:54] that's the last symptom she has is her

[1:46:00] that she's doing great she's doing
[1:46:02] wonderful you saw her sunday she's
