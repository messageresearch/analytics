========================================

and uh looking forward to a wonderful time in the Lord this morning um just thought we'd open up this morning with if you want to stand with me I'm just going to read of the book of Psalms this morning Psalms 133 it says behold how good and how pleasant it is for Brethren to dwell together in unity it is like the precious ointment upon the head that ran down upon the beard even Aaron's beard that went down to the skirts of his garments as the Dee of Hermon and as a dew that descended upon the mountains of Zion for there the Lord commanded the blessing even life forever more Our Father we thank you for this grace and mercy you bestowed upon us to be able to come together and Lord we ask you to just bless us this day that truly you the Holy Ghost will will bring us in unity and in harmony together in the lovely name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ we give thanks amen so you may be seated my brothers God bless you um seeing there's several Brothers here that uh has not been part of our meetings uh just wanted to give you a a brief overview of of what we what we do in the ministers meetings that we've now this we're now in our 15 year of these meetings and we've not one time had a brother and slap another brother kick another brother throw anything at another brother or anything like that not once you know there was a lot of things that happened in the past and I've heard a lot of stories I was never a part of that thank the Lord I've never been a part of that and so by God's grace we've never had that we've had some of the old Fighters come and try but by God's grace he's given us the the mercy and the grace to be a little more mature today so you know um we all come together and I'll send out a flyer like this to all the brothers that's on the mailing list so if you're not on the mailing list I'm on the email list if you'll get your email to me I'll see to it that you receive the the uh flyer um we have a website it's called mmm.com me message I mean ministers how did I put it message ministers meetings of the hour or something like that you'll have to forgive me it's been a few years since I put it up but um I post it on the email that I send out our meetings are all topic centered so the last meeting we were at this topic that we have today which is what do we look for to bring Perfect Harmony and unity among the elect was chosen at the last meeting so it came out of the the the congregation of Brothers uh you know somebody brings up a topic we vote on it sometimes there may be two or three different topics many times we've had a brother over here has a topic a brother over here has a topic and as we start looking at it it winds up being one topic uh because they're really looking at something but as we're all individuals it comes out of my mouth a different from comes out of yours and so you know many times that happens but um sometimes we'll have three or four topics and then we just vote to choose which one and go from there and so when we come together we have the the morning session which is it may be one brother like it's going to be today brother uit or it may be two brothers we have had as many as three in the morning session um and that just depends on the host Pastor sometimes they'll have me to choose sometimes the host Pastor chooses sometimes it'll be a combination of the two of us so it just however the Holy Spirit leads that's what we're trying to accomplish not what we want to do not what I believe it's not what you believe but it's what the holy spirit is trying to bring to us and every one of us from the youngest to the eldest has a part to play uh I want uh you know the Lord put this on my heart uh 15 16 years ago and I tried to get away from it didn't want I didn't want to be I didn't want to be you know a person pushing it but that's what the Lord did and when I refused to do it he started taking things away from me until finally I said I give Lord and so uh looking back over the years I can understand why we're doing it because we've had a lot of many blessings amongst us and so as we we go about this brother Tim has you know a time frame that he has to meet because we have to go to lunch we'll go to lunch and then we'll come back and when we come back that's when everyone in the the congregation of Brethren has the opportunity to speak if they want to there's no pressure on you if you want to find if you don't find um if you just want to listen that's fine um but we try to divide that time up between equally amongst the Brethren and so when we do that I wind up being the timekeeper the clock is not favorable Brothers I mean you know it's just like the guy with the basketball and he's he's got 0.1 second it's not favorable you know he's got to get rid of that thing right now and so when the clock clock goes goes off it's time to stop and so I always try to give the brothers a warning hey you know if you see me sitting there waving I'm letting you know you got about a minute left it's time to wrap it up when you hear the hear the clock go off that's not the time to wrap it up it's time to sit down and so and it's not because we want to be ugly it's not because we want to stop the holy spirit it's because we're supposed to perform our brother you and and so that that's you know that's the Simplicity of it is we're supposed to prefer our brother and whenever it's his time we want to uh we want to take care of his time as much as possible now I'll tell you and some of the brothers here know that at times I've given Brothers some extra time because again we're not a denomination we're not an association there's no laws we have one law and that's the law of the Lord Lord the law of the Holy Ghost and so if he puts it on my heart to let him go you're just going to have to have have confidence in me that the Lord's Lord's let led me to do that because they can tell you I'll sit you down I will get up I will stop you I will sit you down but also the other thing is we are not here to promote a Ministry we are not here to tear down a Ministry it's not allowed now that's not to say a brother can't say hey we're having a meeting or something like that no but we're not here to lift somebody up we're not here to tear anybody down we're here to lift up Jesus Christ and we are here to destroy Satan's kingdom that's our purpose but my brother's not Satan you know you know we can all at any time have the wrong Spirit I've had it we've all we've all been in that case so we do our best to come together in a spirit of love and harmony and I have been just as blessed by Brothers I never heard of before in my life as I have brothers that I've known most of my life because I've learned from the Lord that I can only see so much I can't see through your eyes and you can't see through mine but what the Lord shows you if I can have Grace to come to it with an open mind that the Lord is trying to speak to me then I can see things I never saw before I never caught before my buddy sitting back there brother Clark Thomas he and I we're very different he he he always approaches things from a point of view that Tim Calhoun I can't approach it from that point of view and it's not that it's it's his bad or I'm I'm wrong or or he's right but it's we're two different people and I'll sit there and I'll say man that is awesome I love that and so as the Lord has blessed us at this point to come together in that that's what we're trying to accomplish is that the Lord can open his word to us it's not something new we're not trying to bring anything that the prophet didn't say but we're trying to get all that he said and that's what we're looking to do and so I'm going to get out of the way so brother Tim can can have all the time that he needs and so L God bless you Brothers why don't we stand as brother Tim comes God bless you my brother well we're going to read the word of God so that's why we're standing not for me amen I want to say I appreciate being here together with you can everybody hear okay all right so I appreciate being together with you uh Minister brothers and to share share the same burden that you have of the message of the hour I remember you know when I I was just a young preacher boy myself and when brother and you know right shortly after brother brandom left it seemed like um you know the attitude among the ministry was uh who's going to be the greatest Among Us and who's going to take the Manel now and you know who will Who who will be uh you know the jockey for position one's going to be J and one's was going to be Elisha and another Joshua and another you know there everyone trying to take their position and whatever else and um but you know I I don't believe there's any big ones or little ones Among Us and it's just the graciousness of brother Jason that has asked me to to uh speak today so you know I I don't have any message of my own I just love the Lord with all my heart and and I just um want to serve the Lord together with you so I'm here to encourage you in the things of God and maybe just um impart a little something to you today that might be a blessing that you could take home and study and look at and and consider but let's let's look to Joel chapter 2 and verse 25 and then we'll pray and I will restore to you the years that the Locust has eaten the cankerworm the caterpillar and the Palmer worm my great Army which I sent among you and you shall eat in plenty and be satisfied and praise the name of the Lord Lord your God that it dealt wondrously with you and my people shall never be ashamed and ye shall know that I'm in the midst of Israel and that I am the Lord your God and none else and my people shall never be ashamed and it shall come to pass afterward that I will pour out my spirit upon All Flesh and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy your old men shall dream dreams and your young men shall see visions and also upon the servants and upon the handmaids in those days I will pour out my spirit let's just bow our heads for a moment Lord Jesus as we bow before your throne of grace today we approach humbly before you Lord knowing that we are nothing and there and and I'm gathered here Lord with your minister servants today and speaking to those even around the world that may be hearing this Lord in today or in the days to come Lord you know the hearts of your people and the desire of our heart to see you manifest in your fullness asking Lord that you would Minister to us today and that as we would uh speak about things that is the hope that lies within us of the of the great things of God that you will just break the bread of life to us and speak to us in a very special way today as we give ourselves to you just serve you bless these ministers some are are evangelists are are workers in the church other pastors or whatever their position is Lord we pray that you'll bless them abundantly and use them for your glory we ask in Jesus name amen amen God bless you can be seated and uh want to thank you today for your attentiveness and for this opportunity and and uh I think the last time that I was in a Minister's meeting here in the US was when I was with brother Gerald Hughes way back many years ago now and and uh we went had a little Minister gathering in and so you know we I think the subject matter being of what will it take to unify the bride and you know I'm I'm going to take this original question up from my own angle and um I'm just going to look at it from this angle angled for you know because first of all the only unifier for the bride is the Holy Ghost amen there's no man no Bishop no Cardinal no Pope um that can unify the bride right so that's the only unifier that will work man-made and forced Unity is just denominationalism all over again amen so you know today I'm going to speak today on you know what will unify the bride and of course and that is the bride's Revival and I'm not taking this subject lightly I've studied it coming through 2500 quotes on Revival um and you know just looking at it and we'll we'll look at it in different phases of of course both the ausus uh Revival and the healen Revival are declared over and then of course the bride's Revival is already here is not something coming this was brought on by the seven Thunder uttering their voice in the seventh Angel's message and then we're going to just look into perhaps what is the bride's Revival and I'm sure uh even with the the you know the time frame that we have I will not be able to cover this adequately I will tell you that um I have um a lot of different quotes on the subject that I have categorized and um you know put to put together and uh if any of you you could contact Brother Jason if you don't have my contacts I'll be happy to send them to you um you know the whole list of things that I have went through as I've just studied and and as I laid them out by topic but nevertheless as we look into this today it's I I find it's even questionable sometimes in the mind of many as to whether we can even have a Revival in the in the message or the church age book actually brother brandham talked about the land is full of carnal impersonators and in the last day they will try to imitate that Prophet messenger the seven sons of ska um tried to imitate Paul Simon the sorcer tried to imitate Peter their impersonate impersonations will be carnal they won't be able to produce what the true Prophet produces when he says the Revival is over they will go around claiming in the great Revelation that what the people have is exactly right and God's going to do bigger and more and wonderful things among the people and the people will fall for it now I I'm going to go ahead and say you know by reading uh just a few um select quotes and we will read similar ones to the one I just read as we go along that it seems that there's no hope for Revival after the words revealed we are just a settle down in our churches and instead of being under a Baptist or Methodist or Pentecostal label we just take on a new label under the message Banner where Believers just warm a a a message Pew but God has brought us to the restored word and just to settle down and have churches under a new name with a new doctrine no that's not it we we have returned to the land of the body Bible to welcome back Jesus Christ the Messiah and we cannot be encumbered with the spirit of leoa and and and be without the spirit of Revival for for the the true Spirit of Revival is the Holy Ghost amen and this is the rapture age and the Very word rapture means intense pleasure enthusiasm you Foria El something totally opposite of Leo deia who is lukewarm so we know that the leodan ages already had great stirrings of the Holy Spirit the age would begin in um with the isua Street Revival in 1906 and then in 1946 the angel of God came to brother brandham as and was instructed to take um a message of Divine Healing to the world and this sparked the Great Divine Healing Revival of the 1940s and 50s and by the end of his ministry in 1965 um that Revival was over the the faith of the people were dwindling and churches were taking comfortable positions just settling down and each claiming their territories and having their turf wars um but maybe we might asked what was that Revival like and I just like to share a few things with you uh about that Revival from Brother Brandon's word he said and the message influence in bont he said I was here with my old friend brother Bosworth and Raymond Richie many years ago and many of the Brethren came over I I still believe the same gospel hadn't changed a bit just still the same but you see the Revival was going on then and where there's no Revival you just can't get things done the Ministry is far more advanced it was only telling you then this would come how many remembers that sure you do and it come just exactly like it said it would then I would take my the People by and lay my hands upon them I told you what he told me and just the way it happened it's just exactly it's never failed to be the truth each time and every time so it has to come from God no one could doubt it but you see the Revival is not on just your presence to walk in with the people why people would get out out of Cs and stretchers and walk around you just lay your hands upon them and my just send them just sent them whirling I I've seen prayer lines where be four or 500 people come through the lines and deaf dumb blind crossy not one of them failed but what was healed every one of them try it today see there is no fire in Rome when the fires went out in the temple at Vista the people went home see there's no Revival fire to back it up see that's it and and after a while if if the world stands they'll start living in a glare again see and that's the way it's always done passed over and missed him and that generation is to be judged for what passed over them they fail to see him Jesus Christ is alive this afternoon he is walking around here with us he's every presentence where two or three are gathered in my name I am in their midst believe that won't you so I mean it's like Israel in the journey they left the rock but the rock never left them amen The Rock followed them amen now this brings us to the thought of where brother brandham talks about the cycle of Revival and death and how it never fails and he he talks about you know like how history repeats itself that in the generations of Israel they would see one Revival in one generation to see only the fires fading in the next and the third generation Embers may be glowing slightly but in the fourth there will may be no vestage whatsoever of the original flame and then God lights the fire again the same process is repeated and it's simply a manifestation of the truth that God has no grandchildren salvation is not passed on by natural birth anymore than there's true to Apostolic succession it isn't in the word you can't start with truly you or you start out with truly Born Again Believers and when the next Generation comes along they're no longer just plain Christians but now they've taken on a denominational name and our Baptist or Methodist ex and so forth that's exactly what they are too you see they're not Christians you have to be born of the will of God not the will of man to be saved but these people people these folks are all coming together by the will of man now I don't say that some of them are not right with God not for a minute do I say that but the original fire has died down they are not the same anymore that fervent desire to please God that passion to know his word the cry for reaching out in the spirit it all begins to fade and instead of the church being on fire with the fire of God it is cooled off and become a formal of course that was what happened in Ephesus they were getting formal and and it moved right out in fact the matter is if you listen to brother Bram in the second seal he tells you how the devil got in the book of Acts church that you know that it first came there among the poor and and you know the servants and and and poor people so on like that and he said that's how the spirit fell and then they witnessed to their bosses and more fluent people and then they tried to bring people people to meeting and and they didn't want to bring them to that little dimly light lit places you know and so they wanted to dress it up make it more sophisticated and the next thing you know that nickan Spirit got in there said they didn't want them speaking in tongues and shouting and doing that they they didn't want the moving of the spirit anymore and that's how the devil got in the book of Acts church and here the cycle began where it began to die where the emphasis got moved away from the supernatural gospel to just an intellectual Revival now so you see he says that cycle of Revival and death has never failed now I I'm just I'm just one who believes that we're going to be a people who break the cycle right and the reason I get I have scripture for that because they that are alive and remain will not prevent those that are asleep so there's going to be somebody that is living in this generation that will break the cycle of Revival and death and go in a Rapture amen so you see so he he tells you know what happens that soon you know whirling come in they begin to read books that wasn't fit to read to let down the bars you know the whole thing The Cry Of Joy was gone the freedom of the spirit was gone and all they kept on with the form but the fire had died down and and the blackness of ases is all about is left now as we look at that for moment going back this this revival in this last day started with an angel of God in May of 1946 which came to brother brandham as a light a whipping whirling Pillar of Fire that came into the room where he was in and out of it stepped a 6' 200lb man robed in white with shoulder length hair and we saying I've been sent from the presence of God to tell you of his strange and misunderstood life and that you're to take a gift of Divine Healing to the world and it would start a worldwide Revival and it did yes this message began with the supernatural an angel stepping through the portals between the natural and the supernatural the Mysteries that we hold dear today that have been revealed by the opening of The Seven Seals the seven angels coming faster than the speed of light came breaking through the dimension between the natural and the supernatural yes the message will climax with the supernatural yes with the dead in Christ breaching the portals between the two worlds glorifying their bodies and also changing the living and but and the living too will also breach the portals between the two worlds and meet their theophany and be changed in a moment and a twinkling of an eye amen the gospel started out 2,000 years ago with the supernatural it will end with the supernatural amen so you know going back over what brother Bon spoke of this great Revival that he witnessed he said I'm I'm one of the greatest revivals I believe the world's ever seen in these last 10 15 years it's been a Revival not just like the days of Billy Sunday or the wels Revival the days of Wesley Revival movie uh The Moody Revival Billy Sunday Revival it's been a worldwide sweeping Affair around the world great healing services and great Revival fires has burnt on practically every heel there is in the world right tonight over way over in the lands of Africa down in China Japan this gospel is being preached and people are being healed right this very moment very minute around the world and it has been one of the greatest revivals because I believe it's one of the last revivals this world will see a worldwide sweeping Revival but now in the last few years it's quietened out you don't notice the enthusiasm in the people that used to be I remember having the privilege by the Holy Spirit to spearhead that Revival that started when that angel Lord appeared on that River and and said that about many years ago and to see it happen and see it set ministers hearts of fire and everywhere revivals broke out why you could just simply walk into a building and people would just get up out of their Cs and stretchers and walk away heal you didn't even have to say a word just being there that's all it taken I remember one night in vandelia Illinois I walked in the meeting had no longer had been no more been in the meeting over five minutes and there wasn't a feeble person around the place anywhere wheelchairs pushed out piled up blind with seeing deaf and dumb speaking and just simply the spirit of God was present and he just healed the whole group of them now that's what you can do when that re when Revival is going but let that Revival fire die down then you can Harden it the people are still Christians but they're not revived into that spirit that great atmosphere that does something it's just like a forge in a blacksmith shop you got to get the iron hot before you go to pounding it on the Anvil if you don't you'll never straighten it out and that's what it takes to have a Revival is everybody everybody under the heat of the Holy Spirit that's brought down the powers of God and a Revival moving and there's prayer me then there's prayer meetings going day and night every minute everywhere why the people even wouldn't leave the grounds now but you know we asked ourselves a question did the Divine Healing Revival bring the promised Rapture no you know what it did what it did though it made bigger denominations oh yeah oh yeah brother Brandon said himself in question answer 64 I sent 34 of a million of my children to the Assembly of God and others of course we know went to the Oneness and Full Gospel moves you know brother bam compared it to Moses he said in Moses time this is from Paul a prisoner if you want to write the reference you know and I'll try to give you references as I go along and that might help you to at least take notes from Paul a prisoner you can study this he said Moses time he took him out in the desert kept him out there 40 years stripped him of all his theology his ambition and what a time he could look back and see his failure and how we tonight ought to do the same when we see our ambition look at the healing campaign and see if the Lord did something a few years ago to start restoring healing to the sick and so forth everybody every organization it because if it didn't come into their organization they had to give them a Healer you see they they got interested only in only interested if it was for building their Kingdom now he would say to Tommy osbor when he asked you think I have a gift of Divine Healing he said brother Tommy after this revival starts like this there'll be so many Divine healers in the land it'll be pitiful people won't even uh I won't even want to have a meeting unless you got Divine Healing and Divine Healing is a minor you you can never major with the minor salvation is the main thing to the soul Divine Healing is just a minor thing but I said it'll come to pass because when the phenomena is done there's always a mixed multitude like there was in the days of Noah so I want you to get something for a moment and and we'll get to it in a minute remember this revival is not only produces the true it also will produce the false yes sir so it will produce twins so now even even in the midst of this Divine Healing movement there would be twins that would rise up both claiming to be sent from God yes and both having signs and wonders and and miraculous happen and watch this now as we go along so brother Bram finishing this up in Paul the prisoner now and what have we done let's look at just a moment we've done the same thing Moses did we went out and tried so hard to manufacture some kind of miracle I smelt a disease I got blood in my hand I manufacture a miracle and see what we got some of the men in such hard strains that's broke up become regular drunkards and neurotics and got their minds they switched all the way back in the order from the Pentecostal objective back to making organizations and things and you look at the the men that rose up trying to get in Realms and dimensions maybe that they didn't even belong in you know trying to manufacture a miracle you know you had and and and some some of it was not manufactured some of it was for real yes sir there were true Miracles that would fall you know but you'd have um it was reported in the news anyway that AA Allen died a drunk o o Jaggers tried every gimmick to keep in the light timelight oil in the hands and blood in the face it was a lot of that brother randam was when he preached about Sensations and and and emotion and so on it was O jiggers that he was correcting that move within the Pentecostal circles or Roberts prophesied that 900 foot tall Jesus who told him that to raise millions of dollars or God would kill him and and you know that's how his ministry would end and you know with with such an with such an emphasis such such crudeness you know um that that was so against the word but going back to Paul a prisoner what have we done we slew about one Egyptian now remember Moses went to deliver Israel he killed an Egyptian but it didn't deliver the people right right it didn't set anybody free amen now he said now that's right we've tried we've strained we paid we labored all night long in prayer meetings till we had no voice and try to manufacture something and soup up something and all these type of things and find it to be a total failure we need to going back to the desert right yes sir uh camp meetings and struggles why not just give up that's what you ought to do see go go back and give up why we have done the same thing they did same thing Moses did it doesn't do any good after 40 years he find himself a prisoner to the the word of God what we what we what do we try to do when that great blessing come out and the manifestations of these great things that God told us about that we must be born again how we must receive the Holy Ghost the baptism in the name of Jesus Christ all these other things here you see people instead of staying to that word harnessed to it what did they do they started their own denominational Theory which had already failed and try to manufacture something to look like the truth now now I I just want to tell you we need to do a little bit of self- inventory in this message and not just look out there and say they they they but also realize those Spirits keep moving forward amen now you said what have we got tonight but a a nation full of organized people who deny the scriptures of God who would call the life of the Holy Spirit it was mental telepathy he would refuse such to come into their Church they wouldn't permit you to mention one word of serpent seed eternal security and things that the Holy Spirit has revealed and proved to be the word I make challenge after challenge to come and prove it to me wrong and what have they got the same thing that Luther had the rest of them see slew an Egyptian now watch this what was it maybe he made somebody some man stop stealing or maybe live true to his wife all right but what did you make of him out of that a church member oh come join our group that stinking dead man was the only thing he could Point his finger to of his success of 40 years of training a stinking Egyptian laying there rotten and dead and that's about the way it is tonight the only thing we can point to this revival that is crossed over so-called is a stinking bunch of church members that know no more about God than a hot and Dot would know about an Egyptian Knight that would tell them about the word of God and they say I don't believe that I don't care what they say I don't believe that that's an awful thing to have to point back to for all the strains and the struggles and everything we got maybe we could point to a big school but it's dead we could point to an organization but it's dead it's thinking it's like the first thing that we pulled out of like a hog going to his wallow and a dog to its vomit when we return back one dead Egyptian and I just tell you I mean this is not what we want to accomplish amen we don't want to accomplish a bunch of you know just you know a few stinking dead church members somebody that we got to reform and you know be good and now you know kind of kind of be a a father to his kids and a husband to his wife all all those things are good but if if all the are is a church member when it's over with if all we've done is brought a message of reformation and it is not a message of transformation that transformed their lives and made real Christians out of it now out of that movement that began with a Revival at isusa street that Divine Healing Revival there are now 644 million that's over6 billion p Pentecostal charismatic worldwide including members of Pentecostalism 19,300 denominations and fellowships think of that 6 almost 65 billion Pentecostals produced out of Revival not only that 19,300 denominations out of the Pentecostal message and the message of Divine Healing so what would another Divine Healing move produce let's go a little further what about America would she have another Revival you know the old Virginia boy I think he was from Virginia the Baptist preacher Jerry fwell and he he was he was sure there was a moral majority in America there's not it's an immoral majority it's not there America's a Godless Nation that's turned from the Turning from the lamb now to a dragon a beast that devours the spirit of the Spirit of lawlessness is taking over our country defund the police riding in our streets with sodomites screaming for the rights to kill their children transgenders in our streets declaring that they're coming after our kids and they are we just thought it was Sodom and Gomorrah 25 or 30 years ago it's Advanced now brother Bram tells us in God in Simplicity in Albuquerque he says um you hear me if you believe me to be a messenger from Christ to you if you you believe me if you're not in the kingdom of God you better press right quick if it will not get better it will grow worse all the time now just Mark that down just remember see whether that's right or wrong you see if it's going to be right or wrong it's not going to get better it's going to get worse it's going to get harder all the time the Revival is gone you're only gleaning in the field she's over now you say I disagree with it fine it's okay if you do that's all right that's my conviction conviction that's my hearing from Heaven I believe the leoan ages the Pentecostal age where she comes to the place of lukewarm and God Speer from her mouth from his mouth he goes again in this message super sign sort in 63 he said there'll never be a big Revival in America no more like that if you believe me to be a a prophet you remember that's the word of the Lord just watch and see if it isn't dying the churches are dying they are witheren away and it kills me inside of me to know that men and women that I love better than I love my own life that I give my life he goes ahead and trying to do God's service without his will that he and and this is the one in Los Angeles oh no Jeffersonville where where he talked about this so-called Revival that we're having you know and he said you know America God Bless America it's a it's a Christian country I I'm going to just tell you personally I got a little bit offended when Mr Obama stood up and said we're no longer a Christian Nation right and I thought what in the world what do you mean I mean we were founded on Christian principles as a nation what do you mean we're no longer a Christian Nation and then we have Mr Biden come along and said we're a pride Nation oh yeah now sister to the world this is what we are we are a pride Nation so you know we we have come as brother Brandon said now it's a million miles from being a Christian country I don't even pray for it how can I pray for it and it won't repent under the mighty powers of God demonstrated before it and deny it and closing the doors to it and and walking away so they rejected Revival he told us that a America in Israelite where the gospel he said they didn't come to the spiritual Feast that they were invited to you believe God has give America an invitation of the last 15 years to a great Revival to a spiritual Feast but did they come no sir they then to to reject to come is that a life worthy of gospel that they call themselves that again in super sign in sort in 63 there'll never be a big Revival in America no more like that if you believe me to be God's Prophet remember that's the word of the Lord just watch and see if it isn't dying the churches are dying they're withering away I believe that's a redundant but anyway America as he said there tonight that's the reason this nation stay she's doomed there's no hope for it she's crossed the line between judgment and mercy and she's elected what she has here to control the nation she's rot into the the core her politics is rotten and I I don't care what side of the vent you're on here today whether you're a diat or a a republican a Publican don't matter to me you can put whoever you want in the White House you're not going to turn her around we're doomed he talks about Russia the Holy Spirit was poured out on Russia which called was called called it a feast of Pentecost of spiritual Feast they turned it down he's referring back in the times of the um AR Armenians there when when they came over to the sakarians and the people there that receed warning to leave from uh there that they would all be destroyed if they didn't move out and and it came to pass that's why the sicarians were here in the United States having left Armenia but you know Russia turned it down and it turned to Communism England he said turned it down it's not just America it's the whole world yes yes amen you know I know America will burn with fire and I'm not defending that but the whole world's going to Def burn with fire amen but now so he talks about how that he bid three times he sent out and they didn't listen to the feast and he sent again he said go and compel those people to come and the table's got to be set the table's ready there's still room now listen and I believe that maybe maybe within the next few months or something a year or whatever it is God is going to send another shaking across the country for there's still there's somebody still out there somewhere that's a predestinated seed that the light has got to fall on somewhere somewhere in the world the nation itself is gone so the nation is gone but he said there's still a predestinated seed that the light has to fall on Amen so he says go God's going to send another shaken now we know of a certain we cannot reproduce ausa Street and neither should we try we cannot reproduce another Divine heand Revival or another worldwide sweeping Revival amen you see something that would accompany this great feed of adding 6 billion to the cost for the past 100 Years of Pentecostals and the charismatics have tried to Breathe new Revival fires into that and they have blown and blown upon the ashes of that Revival and the only result just being the the so of the P fires blackening their faces oh yes but remember remember in the midst of all this I I want you to catch this and this is from the era of God's Deliverance in 56 remember when God sends a Revival hell sins one two in the lamb and the dove in 1957 brother bradam said here he said now we know in the last day there's going to be a Revival of the supernatural that is not going to be of God whoa let me read it again there's going to be a Revival of the Supernatural That's not going to be of God we know that but the way we to tell it is by the Bible that's right by the Bible because it said many will come to me in that day and say Lord have I not done this and that and he will say depart from me that's right that must be it it must be absolutely be thus sayith the Bible so again as we look at this remember there will be a Revival of the supernatural that is not going to be of God now is now let me get something straight it is not that the devil is going to do Supernatural and bring healing and and no we have done Mighty Works in thy name so it is not I want to get this point I I realize we we talk about the anointed once at the end time but I want you to get something really clear down in your heart the rain is sent for the wheat amen the anointing is for the grain yes but but because the others you know are in the same field they get watered too and they bring forth fruit of the seed that they are yes so don't ever call the anointing false right right amen true you see it you know it is it is a anointed false ones at the end time amen the anointing is true the seed is false how do we know they're false because they're contrary to the word of God now so now God is Sovereign though so Revival is a sovereign move of God no man manufactured to Zeus the street right no man manufactured you know the the the Divine Healing move come on I was a supernatural Heaven open an angel stepped out of a light From Another Dimension it wasn't prayed down it wasn't called down it wasn't forced down it it was God sovereignly moving and so you know this is this is the thing is a Revival is something Sovereign of God Amen it's not something that can be manufactured or man-made or drummed up or worked up or are are made by man amen now so you know the B just said to brother bradam and there's several incidents of this and this is from trying to do God of service in sort he said you know he said I was talking to my Baptist Brethren brother bradam we can only have Revival when we take the word word by word Page by Page Letter by letter he said I believe it too Page by Page I've been trying it all along he said well we must try to find the the Greek interpretation of the word what the Greek said he said I hadn't read too much but reading the history of the church and the n and counsel and prean counsel and Nan fathers they're arguing back there about about the Greek that was 2,000 years ago one said it means this the other said it means that the word the Greek word means this and he said but all the word is inspired and and he says it won't work it won't work it comes by God revealing himself so he said a revival can never come until God The Sovereign God sends it and then he might take up a little knit with that can't even sign his name and do with it that knows not even good English let along the Greek and so he goes on to say now if there's anybody got Mechanics for Revival is our Noble brother Billy Graham but the mechanics is all right but the mechanics won't move it it takes the Dynamics to move it you can build an automobile put fine seats in it find Pistons prove by science what it can do but unless the DI Dynamics is there she is just a piece of a dead piece of goods so again as as we uh go on in there he said that's what God does he alone has the right to send a Revival not get the mechanics together is pray for God to send the Dynamics but even so many of the message community and and I'm speaking generally here and I'm not pointing anybody out but uh just as a community of you know if we say Christians uh one term of that can mean Catholics methodists Baptists what so we're all Christians we're all lumped into that same lump so when I say message Community we're all a part of the same message no matter whether we're two Soul seven Thunder whatever we whatever label we have you know we're all lumped into one the message community so you know but there's but as we say today even of the message Community there's so much that is void of the Dynamics that all we have is a billy gram type of mechanics even the conversion offered by Billy Graham type of conversion is one of easy believism and and that's that's friend is not a raptured message is it tribulation message it won't give you a ticket in the Rapture it'll get you a ticket to the tribulation you see Billy Graham would have thousands who responded to his pleas to come up and receive Jesus as Lord of your life and confess I'm a sinner and I accept Christ as Savior and he found that most of them didn't stick he could come back you know after 30,000 receive Christ come back a year later can't find 10 who stayed true he blamed it on lazy preachers but brother brandham told him the problem you didn't take them far enough so Billy Graham had the mechanics of Revival but not the Dynamics of it today it's not even come up and accept Jesus since because even altar calls are frowned on so just sit tight in your seat and just accept the message as being true and brother brandham is a prophet and if you believe that you got the Holy Ghost oh my and to call that the new birth Brethren is blasphemy no wonder we got a bunch of rotten eggs in the nest cuz they've never been with the male bird amen amen and hear you himm and there's many on this you can go back and study on it but you know where brother bradam talks about a hen can lay an egg but if she hadn't and she can sit till she's so poor to she can't get off the nest but they'll never hatch if she hadn't been with the male bird they're rotten and he said and that's the just what's the matter today we just took in so many members and so forth and babying them here and babying them there and just got a nest full of rotten eggs it's time to clean the thing out and get the people with the mate Christ Jesus with the word of God back in action and power then we will have have a Revival that has Shake something and do something then you'll see Christ right on the scene on the power he cannot come as long as these things are blocking him what What's blocking him we got too many converts to the message who have never been born again right I said some years ago and I've been around for longer than what I want to say but I said some years ago I mean that we were ripe in this message that there would either be a Revival Among Us that would bring the power of the Holy Ghost in in the midst of people or there would be a great Fallen away and we've seen both yes yes amen now listen now in this moment brother brandham calls it that Satan sins a poisoned Revival that's oh my so be Not Afraid 1960 in chitaka he says you know he's preaching on testimony of the sea you know all them similar sermons he said we have we have gone off on a tantrum of how many big fine buildings we can build how many great how well we can make our denomination grow and we went off without him and the devil's come in with his poison winds to start a Revival amongst the people saying don't you believe that's Supernatural there's no such thing as Divine Healing you better go to psychiatrist and get your mind examined before you become a missionary or a minister and all that kind of nonsense a poisoned Revival that tries to say that the power of God that operates through the church is a bunch of fanaticism wow now as I said every Revival produces twins brother bradam starts and there's a junction lot of a lot of times we we take the seals but you got to go back before that because as he steps into the ministry of Elijah if you do a little study you will find out that brother brandham it was as he studied the church ages yes that he understood the last messenger be Elijah and he places it with Malachi 4 yes so before then the Aral quotes about we need another Elijah and so on like that but it's only until then that he steps into that under a a greater inspiration of that Elijah anointing and so he preaches the church ages because he he's showing us where we've been so we can know where we are yes amen uh is it's kind of like this I years ago I I went on a trip with a friend of mine and we were going down to Florida his father had died and and I was going down there to do a little little um uh memorial service for him and so uh as I got into my vehicle to leave I thought oh I said I I said wait wait I got to go back I I forgot my map you know this Ford GPS and all this stuff we have today don't need them no more people don't know how to read them right but anyway I you know I I said I got to get my map and he said ah you don't need no map brother Tim I know it like the back of my hand I've been I've been through I've been through to Florida so many times I know the way all the I said listen you know the way but I don't know the way and I need them M but you don't need them M but I'm going to go get my map amen so I get you know map out chart out where I'm going so I know where I am what highways what Junctions and so on and I start down the road and about 2: in the morning I get tired and now I'm so weary you know I looked over him I said hey you mind driving an hour oh sure I said okay listen I said there's a junction down the road you don't want to miss oh now I know brother Tim I know this way I've been here I I went down here seeing my folks many many times I said yes sir I said but down here's a junction I said don't want to miss it so I okay so he starts driving I go to sleep in about an hour I wake up and the the vehicle stopped and I wake up and I'm I said where where are we at he said I don't know the road just disappeared I said wait a minute the road don't disappear you know what are you talking about he said well yeah he said I was going around here and he said the road disappeared he said look on that map and tell me where we're at I said buddy it don't work that way I cannot look on this map and tell you where we're at all right I said now you got lost there's an all night station go in there and ask him this question where am I yeah and I said when you find out where you are I'll find out where we're at on the map yes and I can get us on the right road to Florida amen now hey friends we had the map yes we had the Bible That's yes yes amen but we didn't know where we were at that's amen so God sends a prophet and says here you are here's how where you traveled all the way down you can go back from Genesis all the way down or you can start at Pentecost you go all the way down but here's all the Junctions along the road and we're at Leo deia all right and the next Junction of course we know what it's going to be it's the resurrection and the Rapture in the next the marriage supper in the next come on we know where to go because we had a prophet amen said you are here and we can now look at the road map now so here he is in the Ephesian Church age I'm emphasizing this as he preached in the r r ojc he said when a Revival comes there's two classes of people comes out of every Revival there's a natural man that goes he'll come at the altar and say yes sir I accept the Lord that Christ is my savior he'll go out what does it happen the first thing you know he'll wind up in some good cold formal church because he thinks well if I join church I'm just as good as an next-man I'm am I not just as good as so and so what difference does it make as long as I belong to church make my confession wh why it's a whole lot of difference you've got to be born again You' got to had the birthright Jacob didn't care how much he was laughed at he wanted that Birthright he didn't care how he had to get it a lot of people don't want that to get the birth right because they think it's just a little unpopular they don't want to get down at the altar and cry a little bit and go without a few meals and do and something another they don't want to do it a lot of women a lot of you make up on that they think it they cry they might wash it off and have to put it on again I don't mean to say that sacriligious hope it don't sound that that way but it's the truth they just don't want it they don't want the new birth because the new birth is kind of messy now wait a minute brother Brandon brings this concept all the way down through 65 past the seals and he says the new birth is kind of messy it's like any other birth any birth is a mess I don't care where it's at if it's in a pig pin or in a barn if it's in a pink decorated hospital room it's a mess so that the new birth is a mess and amen it'll make you do things you didn't think you would do stand on a corner beat a tambourine sing glory to be to God hallelujah praise God glory to God while you'll act like a maniac amen that's what it done to the apostles that's what had done to the Virgin Mary she act like she was drunk she was a mess in society but it takes a mess for life to come out of Amen but the other you know the other I'm a fine fellow I pay my t eyes I do this and but he said you got to die and R there to your thoughts and let the Holy Ghost come and take you over and just do whatever he wants to you and he said get kind of messy with it that sounds horrible not sacriligious but the truth that's the only way I know to punch it out make you understand what's more of a mess than a dignified bunch of Jews that day than to see these people come out there with Stam lips you know what Stam is brother bradam demonstrates what a stammer is other tongues acting like drunk people and demonstrates how drunk person acts that's exactly what they' done they look messy and and he said but these are are these men full of new wine but after what after one kind of got to himself he said let it not be known to you hearken to my word these are not drunk like you suppose but he went back to the scripture this is that that was spoke of the Prophet by the prophet Joel It's come to pass in the last day said God I'll pour out my spirit upon All Flesh that's the way the church was born first how many believes God is infinite then he cannot change and if that's his kind of idea of a church at the beginning that's the kind of church he'll have at the end he cannot change so how are you going to substitute shaking a hand or sprinkling or some other thing that didn't happen back there each one of the Apostles went right back to it amen now so he so you know he he goes on in there but he you know speaking about that there's there's a a lot more that we could read and I'm skipping it to save some time all right now so just looking at this for a moment he says in the message uncertain sound this is in Spokane in 62 that's the reason we're losing it we're taking our boys and teaching them education and and friends if we're not careful on we will turn this message into seminars teaching seminars we will educate people into doing right yes yes that's the truth brother instead of a change of nature that's right we will teach them how to live right and do right and we'll have classes and and and seminars on how to have marriages good marriages and we'll do this and we'll do that friends that ain't it right it's a new birth people are needing amen we'll try psychology and you know set them down and learn how to conform your nature listen it's not confirmation is transformation amen Amen brother amen now so you see there there again you know we it goes right on now remember remember here that needs to be a house cleaning I'm just going to tell you needs to be a house cleaning from the pulpit to the back pew and I'm not going to do it it'll take the Holy Ghost amen I'm not even going to pretend I'm able to do it you know already I just want to say already and you Brothers know it I know this is public may go on the internet may be everywhere but already we've had homosexuals in our pulpits yes yes we have had adulterers in our Pulpit we have had leaning leading ministers who turn and deny the message yes why because even in the ministry we have those who have not the Seal of God Amen brother amen and I don't care how gifted you are and how talented you are you must be born again amen that is the first thing brother brandom emphasized that over and over he said don't you go out and preach or do do nothing Jesus said don't go out and preach or do nothing you meet in the city of Jerusalem till you're empowered yes yes amen with indued with power from on high amen but you know many have run off without the Holy Ghost you can see the evidence in their lives right and because of that you see the evidence in the church yes yes spirit filled it takes Spirit-filled men to give birth to Spirit-filled children that's TR amen that's the truth amen now okay so we we have those even today without the Seal of God is proven now it brings you brother bradam said and spoken words Original Seed he said now this brings you right back to the spoken word then where we are God's word made manifest Jesus said the same thing he he that believeth on me the the and the things and who I am and what I came for the purpose I do to bring a man to bring a man back to believe the word of God and take nothing else with it the works that I do he'll do also there you are why is it not being done today it's hybrid bastard children mixed up it don't it's IMM it don't know what it believes amen and what is the Holy Ghost given for the works that I do say you do also not another work but God wants to bring the Holy Ghost in you to continue right the same work that he was doing in Christ brother what what in the world you expect of of this move and what do you expect we ought to be like well let me just quote from the prophet let's see what he expected this is you know from God of this evil age might help you you know I I read a book on Killing Lincoln and let's see somebody might know Riley oh Bill O'Reilly he he he's the one that was the author of it and I I read a book on you know today the man who had so many days to live he do such and such and he goes through some yeah it's a nice book on history but anyway I read I read that book on killing L and I I it made me think well God what were you trying to impart to us the last few days the few hours of brother Brandon's Ministry yes I mean you had a message this was listen this is not brother Brandon's message that's right this was a message of Jesus Christ to the leoan age and brother Brandon was the messenger yes that's right right amen so God was imparting some things to us and here's one of the last sermons he preaches I'll tell you another study is ashamed of him yes are you ashamed of your Pentecost experience Are you ashamed of speaking in Tong are you saying yes I believe the Full Gospel right that's being ashamed of him that's things God was trying to impart to us last words yes watch now God of this evil age this is August 65 so you see he only had a few months to live one of the last sermons to his church he said and she's caused the whole world to accept the scientific leadership of the educational program that Satan has given to her under the name of a church the leadership of an educational scientific program I'm picturing to you the God of this world and when she as Eve had the very filling of God's word in her hand she could have took God's word but what did she do to that instead of taring for the baptism of the Holy Ghost left science prove to her that the Holy Ghost was only for the disciples all and instead of keeping Divine Healing going when she ought to be raising now raising the dead and doing great Miracles she has L Satan under his religious under his leadership of religious men take the word of God and try to say it was for another age and she's believed it when the Bible said the things that I do shall you do also good Jesus said go you into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature we we're still creatures these signs shall follow everyone that believe amen she denies every bit of it she denies all the supernatural she swapped it for his intellectual conception of the Bible now I'm going to read you a phrase right here where priest holy fathers so-called Bishops Archbishop District presor G overseers now I'm going to leave all that out and read it again where where they have put their own interpretation to it and God has left them dead as 12:00 the only thing we have left in the last days is a bunch of little Pentecostals with a bunch of music whooped up as hard as they can running up and down the floor speaking in tongues and shouting having a form of godliness but denying the word thereof tell them to be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ they'll laugh in your face but what that but God goes right on making it just so just the same proven his word to be so so two groups one with knowledge of the word and no Spirit and the other all spirit and no word you see but it's got to be spirit and truth yes now I'm a farm boy you want to keep a chicken in a pen you clip One Wing that's right don't clip them both he'll have balance he can still fly right clip One Wing he'll just fly around in circles right are you with me amen he can never get off the ground amen now God gave us the the gospel it comes in spirit and in truth yes it takes two wings to fly you can't just have truth without Spirit or Spirit without truth you got to have both of them or you'll never get off the ground amen now so you see there's two groups one all knowledge of the word no Spirit other all Spirit you know one of them fundamental positionally they know by the mechanics that they are Sons and Daughters of God brother Brandon said Pentecostals got all the faith but don't know who they are he said if I could just get the two together yes I believe the message brings the two together amen amen the fundamental and and those who have the spirit Faith were in the word together that was the what the message was to do bring them together amen and so he goes on he said there's where Satan got in to make it all mechanics and no Dynamics back all Dynamics and no mechanics but see we got to put it together we got to have the power of the Holy Spirit but we got to come back with the word to feed this machine it won't feed on a Creed it chokes up the flu and he goes on he said now not just he said man shall not live by bread alone but by every word not just part of it every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God yes it takes both of them two wings of our and every word well brother Tim we believe the Mysteries all right well do you believe the supernatural you believe the gifts of the Spirit you believe in speaking in tongues you believe do you believe in shouting well no we we've left that well you see you're only got one Wing that's right that's right you'll never get off the ground amen now every word you can't leave Holiness out that's right you can't leave mystery truths out amen you cannot deny any of it gifts of the Spirit the token which is the true baptism of the Holy Ghost something beyond the anointing of the of the human Spirit but abides within the soul that seals you to the day of redemption yes amen so you see brother brandom tells us in God's provided place of worship in Los Angeles he said when this great moving power of God comes into a Son of God it quickens him the spirit of Life enters into him then what did it do it seeks him in Heavenly places not there will be we are now now we are already resurrected the Dynamics and mechanics going to work quickened us and we're quick up into the presence of God where his spirit is now we are seated together in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus sitting in there that great seat that's already fired up been raised from the dead we're part of it if you're part of the Bride you are because the Bride is a part of the groom you know and we find out it's the same thing she'll do exactly what's predicted for her to do in this day she won't be a Leo toan by no means a lukewarm she'll be on fire for God she'll be moving on in the spirit of God brother brandham talked about him he talked about movements past this is how can I overcome this is 1963 in August 25 and he says we got a movement some of the Holiness groups they can't call the Holy Ghost Holy Ghost cuz they don't they they identify themselves with Pentecostals when they do that they say holy spirit to keep from saying Holy Ghost because the Pentecostal common people just call it what the Bible says holy ghost which Holy Spirit and Holy Ghost is the same thing but they're very careful about it watch they don't want to be identified with them tongu speaking people and that that's the Holy Spirit itself then he went right on and he said you see what they have done he said the unclean Spirit has gone out of a man and has walked in dry places and that house was in filled with the Holy Ghost and he comes back and they're worse right and there's a lot in the message Community would have been better off to stay in denomination look at the last SL to see an age see how it closes out you study again you know it it you know you see how you see how it closes out with some of the church failing to overcome and actually becoming lukewarm and Powerless and Jesus being refused entrance into his own church now listen folks you can go back and look at the Pentecostal and say oh that was them no it advances forward yes yes and right now in message circles Jesus Christ the holy spirit is being refused entrance yes yes into his own church that's the truth give you a quote door to the heart door of the heart 571 1212 God does not like his church to be lukewarm he said either be cold or hot and because you're lukewarm I'll spew thee from my mouth that certainly fits the situation the day of the modern church and the Pentecostal church today just a lukewarm condition neither cold nor hot it would be better if we would either be back in their old denominational State status or either be up in the Realms of the blessing of God than to sit in a lukewarm condition as we are in now the Lord would appreciate us much more if we would do it spiritual Amnesia brother brandham talks about it you know the experience worldwide he said that kills me as an evangelist no fire burning no enthusiasm There's No Going to it as evangelist it just kills me and he says you're lukewarm now let me just get there I want to just go into a couple of Revival killers Revival Killers now one of the one of the great Revival Killers reason there are no Revival is because we are predestinated secure and the rest can just go to hell if they want to good in the fifth seal brother brandham told us about John Wesley and z zingle and Calvin how they got the church to security till they didn't want no more revivals whatever is going to be is going to be that was all of it and they just lived any kind of lives we're the bride we're predestinate we're the elect We're The Chosen we've received the word we've accepted the knowledge of the Mysteries and we call that the evidence of the Holy Ghost you know again this is a Revival killer that we and yes we got to tell people you're chosen from the foundation of the world and and you you you were in God you understand that's our position in Christ and we're positioned there not by our knowledge of the message amen we are positioned there by the baptism of the Holy Ghost that made us sit in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus and gives us a position in the heavenlies amen now so you said so so again we we have received the word we've accepted the knowledge of the Mysteries and many of us call that the evidence of the Holy Ghost our evidence is we believe the word brother we've emphasized this part 1 Corinthians 13:1 though I speak with tongues of men and angels and have not charity I become a sounding brass and tinkling symbols we have taken this we have minimized speaking in tongu until 98% of our people have never had the supernatural experience of speaking in tongues the least of the gifts much less any of the greater gifts very true and though I have the gift of Prophecy we have preached against gifts until there are no gifts yeah we claim to have the full word now and yet part of it is now declared unwanted or unneeded we now claim they're on the Shelf there's no quote for that by the way Amen brother Bram said I believe I I desire one day that there would be the gifts as it were laid on the mantle right he didn't say on the Shelf said on the mantle but he is not talking about this time he's talking when we enter into eternity when perfect love he said will be and he said there won't be any laying hands on the sick Dan and there won't be any need to preach it'll all be over that's when all the gifts will be laid on the mantle right now For Heaven's Sake we need all of Heaven amen amen we're going to e everything the word says you can't just have part of it amen amen but we've claimed that they're now on the shelf and tongues are just baby talk the only ones who even want the gifts are babies well that's not the teaching of the Apostle Paul right he said follow after charity and but and desire spiritual gifts but rather that you may prophesy right and understand now what what what just just wait for a minute let me let me just say something here we've come down to where every gift is denied till now within the message Community the last gifts of the five-fold ministry which were sent from heaven yes are now being denied oh yeah and unwanted and castigated and set aside and told you have nothing to say Amen he just kept on going yes till it got your gift brother so so again Paul would say I would you all to speak with tongues if I had my desire for you I I wish should' all have this Supernatural experience right it's the least of the gifts but it's still Supernatural that's right that's right oh yeah we know it's impersonated and manufactured but brother bam tells us in standing the Gap that no matter how bad it's been impersonated there is still a real genuine one that's always to be in the church amen standing in the Gap so but but you know how come we never take it this further you know you know well you know though we have tongues of men and angels and you know though I would prophesy and have faith I can move mountains and I without charity I'm another but what about this other part and understand all Mysteries and all knowledge uhhuh yes yes so if we're going to do away with tongues prophecy Moving Mountains faith we got to do away with understanding all Mysteries and all know a true in fact of the matter the Church of Christ spirit that brother brandham went out to defeat when he said I took a little slingshot of Faith this little gift and I went out to meet the Goliath that said the days of Miracles are passed and there's no such thing as Divine Healing that thing has moved right into our message where we minimize the Supernatural and the Church of Church of Christ Doctrine is being preached from message pulpits good so here's another Revival killer I only got time for a little few of these another Revival killer in every age spurning Church age we have exactly the same pattern that's why the light comes to some god-given messenger in a certain area and then from that messenger there spreads the light through the ministry of others who have been Faithfully taught but of course all those who go out don't always learn how necessary it is to speak only what the messenger has spoken remember Paul warned the people to say only what he said 1 Corinthians 14:37 if a man think himself to be a prophet or spiritual let him acknowledge that the things I write unto you are the Commandments of the Lord what came the word of God out of you out from you or came it to you only they adhere or take away there and soon the message is no longer pure and the bival dies down how careful we must be to hear one voice for the spirit has one voice which is the voice of God Amen now so again he said Paul could not change what he wrote he said Peter couldn't change what he wrote amen what he was inspired to say neither can we and he said every fresh and true Revival will be because men have gotten back to the word for their age The Cry of every age is rebuke you have left the word of God repent and come back to the word from the first book in the Bible Genesis to the last book in Revelation there's only one reason for God's displeasure leaving the word and there's only one remedy to regain his favor back to the word amen so we must be believ by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God but you know now we have f trained me ministers in our midst you know we we've uh find training of ministers we've educated them in the message and it's taking the place of and I'm quoting all night prayer meetings in the old time way we used to get to God instead of having preachers we got lecturers men who know the word just as well just sit it to put it there and put it together in such a way it's astounding how they can do it they know the mechanics but that ain't the Dynamics we want the Dynamics I don't care about the mechanics I want to know the Dynamics what does it do yes amen amen now so again brother brandom told us you know what it would be and it is rising in the sun example of two cars one of them got all the bells and whistles God the leather seats and is polished and everything else and it's just beautiful but there's no fire in the engine and the other one has fire in the engine it goes somewhere when brother Brenham left us he left us a car that ran amen it would drive down the road to Divine Healing it would drive to the baptism of the Holy Ghost it would drive right down to the real power of God to Holy life to Godly men and godly women yes amen amen amen it it worked yes it was a gospel it was a card that would go somewhere I don't know who's been fiddle fatling with the mechanics and messing it all around but I tell you many we got many sitting in a church parking lot that won't go not even an inch it won't even hey the battery is so run down it won't even crank anymore right and some of that's all they can do is just grind around on the engine just make a little noise like brother Brandon said he saw this fine train and he described it was had a zephyr engine and I don't know what all you know he was quite enthralled with and I looked at this old train and I said when's it going to move he said can it move he said no sir I'd like to take a little ride no sir it can't move why he said there's no fire in the engine that's what's the matter with the church today it's all pushed up and decorated with no fire in the engine you can only move by fire and what we need today is some more Holy Ghost and Fire yes and that's what's happened to so many they they they've accepted the tradition of easy believism the message of Billy Graham instead of the message to Abraham and that message of Graham of easy believism I just accept the message and say it's right and I believe God sent a prophet and you got the Holy Ghost that'll send you to the tribulation just the same as it will the Baptist that's all to do for you today he said and Fallen the world is again falling apart in fre Port we've studied the mechanics until it's all mechanical I'll tell you what we've had 60 years just about since brother brandham left of studying the mechanics we've had them fiddle fadle with it and whatever else you know we you we got it you know we can put up our charts and we can and all those things you know I'm I'm not down in none of them they have their place amen but that don't bring the power of God where is the power of God that used to be in the church I'm quoting brother Bram where is the Pentecostal blessing that used to flow through the churches you mean a Pentecostal blessing is to flow through our churches you mean that come on brother Tim what do you think we are a bunch of Pentecostals well that's what I am that's what Paul was that's what Peter was that's what James and John was come on that's what Jesus was Pentecost was just receiving the same Holy Spirit the spirit of Jesus that came on the day of Pentecost you know today I just submit to you today is the day when the day of Pentecost fully comes yeah amen but we have great intellectual teachers and where does it take us like I said we've had 60 years of Kingdom Builders and made personality Cults yes since the prophet left us yes now we don't have 19,000 denominations from it yet but we're working on it oh yes amen look look at look at the Folly a powerless group of people whose only weapon is argument right amen Church age Book quote there's no Revival possible unless Jesus is welcome back in the midst again and the ministry and the people quit putting him out of the church like a bunch of leans do now I'm going to challenge you go study the leoan church age how many beli brother bradam was a messenger how many believes that was the age our age leoa seventh angel seventh message seventh Messenger right all right so go listen to his message that's he preaches his message to Leo deia and in that brother brandham tells us he preaches he preaches several thoughts he brings in Jesus with dirty feet the unwelcomed Christ yes that he preaches all over the place that was not just a story he was telling the condition of the age that Jesus had come and he was unwelcomed and unwanted because of Pride that's right first sermon he preaches on it is pride and then he preaches Jesus with dirty feet Jesus keeps all his appointments all these others so he but he talks about Israel and he said what caused the Jewish Branch to be cut off you know we're according to Romans n we are the the Olive Branch the wild branch that was grafted in and because the the true Branch or the original Branch was cut off yeah and so so he said what caused Israel to be cut off the original tree because they rejected Paul's Pentecostal message and do you believe this is the last Church age the Bible said so and what did say going to happen to them they're going to be cut off because of rejecting the Pentecostal message then God will turn to the Jews now then there's the other side all screaming hollering calling at the bride's Revival which which is in in effect nothing more than a bunch of man-made emotional workup right and that's where Satan gets in he gets in make it all mechanics and no Dynamics or all all Dynamics and no mechanics got to have them both together yes sir the word the word of God is is not Creeds of some personality cult it's not some man's Thunder a bunch of Noise with no lightning but it's the power of God on displine we've had years now teachers that claim to be the Aaron to Moses who was needed to say brother help brother Brandon say what he couldn't say oh my you know we we've U we've had self-proclaimed apostles who thought they were needed to bring Clarity to the message again this was thought you know brother Brandon needed help to say what he couldn't say they too have their own books because what they say can't be found in the message had to make their own we've had eighth Messengers oh yes oh yes you know we we we have wannabe prophets that that that have risen they've invaded the pull Pit Brother Brandon said without a call from God they've styled themselves like Fishers of Men the founders of a move of God they say the gifted five the gifted Ministry of Ephesians 4 that God gave the churches failed so they two are taken over and so here we are right in the midst of the Fulfillment of Prophecy called the gainsaying of cor they don't even know they fulfilled it so they add here and they take away there and soon the message is no longer pure the Revival dies down how careful we must be to hear one voice for the spirit has but one voice which is the voice of God Amen now so as we we we got to get back to the blood back to the real power of the Holy Ghost under the token there there is hope for Revival because God is hearing the cries the S because of the bondage he hears the cries of our young people with suicide Spirits delving down in porn perversions of all kinds sex sins un unimaginable are you with me amen you know he hears those cries but as brother Brandon said in the voice of the sign he is only waiting for his people to call call him on the scene he's there he's available but he's waiting on you to call for him and there is a remedy you don't have to go out to these psychologist and whatever to get the remedy the remedy is in the baptism of the Holy Ghost I tell you what the Holy Ghost will fix 99% of marriage problems in your church it it'll fix the behavioral CH problem in your children it'll I I'm telling you the Holy Ghost will I mean you may need 1% of instruction and a little guidance here and there but the rest say you just give them the Holy Ghost they'll take what the word of God said and they'll light up to it yes yes yes it'll take away with your hours and hours of counseling the counsel they need is Get Down The Altar and repent amen sir Amen brother bradam said and Indi he said they call for Revival everywhere how you going to have Revival when the word itself can't work through the people oh my I'm running out of time so we we go right on brother brandom said you know when we see what God has done in this generation what it ought to do for us this is this is why Christ speak we need a repentance we need a Revival I'm saying it myself I need a shaking I need something I speaking to myself this morning or about myself I need a wakening up how was our Prophet well brother Tim the reason there's no hope for Revival that you're expecting is because it's a word Revival and you know it's the word word and the word only and you just said it brother Tim there's only one remedy to get regain his favor and that's back to the word our Revival is the opening of the word brother Tim but yeah why little Bethlehem we bypassed on Creeds and drinking stagnated water for from Sister what we need today is an opening of the word that lives and he's the same yesterday today and forever I tell you what many of what we got no wonder the world don't want it it don't live that's right no wonder the kids don't want it it don't live at home that's right right amen you know and friends you can preach whatever you want to from the pulpit but if it don't live in your home it's worthless life can't come from an intellectual Revival that's right I'm reading this now from broken sister 65 that life cannot come from just an intellectual Revival it's got to come out of the Bible word Revival and the word is the same yesterday today and forever and when it falls today and quickens listen you get the same results you did in Acts 2 amen exactly it always has and always will be because it's the spirit of God that conditions the atmosphere brother wrote me recently and he he is a lay member and he he was from South Africa he said I I'm really concerned about my church brother we have a WhatsApp group and they put on there you know about prayer for so and so and prayer for and he said you know in our church there's never an alter call there's never prayer for the sick and and he said I'm concerned about it I I wrote it back I I'm not concerned that there's no altar calls or no prayer for prayer lines in your church that's not what I'm concerned about I'm concerned that the atmosphere is not there to cause souls to run to the Altar and an atmosphere produced where the sick can be healed that's what I'm concerned amen it's not the physical prayer line and the act of going through the prayer line or people coming down the altar I'm concerned there's no atmosphere it takes the atmosphere of the Holy Ghost amen you you can see what brother Bram said it's got to be brought into Focus if you great message to to listen to is the message look I got so many things from in 1963 brother Bron preached it God read it I I was studying one time coming back on the plane and I was just weeping and crying through every paragraph of it but anyway he said he said if obeying the word taking this range fi finder and bringing it down to place till I see the same thing those Apostles saw and the gospel they preach it'll produce the same results because it did for them it'll strike the target every time no matter what the churches said and the people who claims to be I don't know it'll do it but this is what I want to look at that the word to see that it's exactly in focus to see the same vision they saw and it'll do the same job that it did for them it'll heal the sick it'll raise the dead it'll cast out Devils it'll bring forth a glorious Church who is willing to seal their testimony with their own blood if it comes necessary to do that amen so you see there again we have all of these things of course there's a lot of things that we could go on today but I want to get down to here on the bride's Revival brother brandham told us and I was there as a little boy when brother brandham said this he Saidi not looking for Revival in our generation I'm looking for the coming of the Lord in our generation now they were the Revival he's speaking of was another Divine Healing another great isua movement another world wide sweeping Revival but you realize the coming of the Lord comes first as the word to a prophet the come of the Lord is not moment twinkling in the eye that's her change it happens in stages yes the coming of the Lord comes first as a word to a prophet yes and then the word taken on flesh being fully manifested in Bride form and then finally caught up to meet the Lord in the air see it took the fullness of the word to make a bride uh Christ had to come in word form to a prophet but that ain't where it ends a lot of people get that far God sent a prophet and we got a message that's wonderful but you realize what is produced it must take on flesh amen it must it must produce not just the word coming it must change to the bride coming yes yes amen because if there's no bride if there isn't Christ in Bride form there'll be no Rapture to be nobody to come for and if God had not send us a message there would have been no bride that was born out of that word so that there could be a Rapture but remember it's not the message is only the precursor it's what was pointing to what was it to produce Christ has to be here on Earth in bride's Farm yes now you know I I can go right on down where you know the different things and I'm skipping a lot of things but you know in the third seal brother bandam this famous quote today that's what reason today we the revivals we're supposed to have we have denominational revivals we haven't had a real stiring no no no sir don't think we got revivals we haven't oh they got millions and millions of church members but not a Revival nowhere oh again he he told us just a denominational Revival then he says the bride hasn't had a Revival yet there's been no Revival there no manifestation of God totir the bride yet we're looking for it will take those seven unknown Thunders back there to wake her up again he will send it he promised it now watch so you see here again brother bradam said the bride has not had her Revival yet and many have run off with it well now we are the Brides Revival let me tell you he told us what it would take to bring it it would take those seven unknown Thunders which were the Mysteries contained in the Seven Seals to give us an open book the full word yes and from that full word would come the bride's Revival yes not part of the word that's why I'm advocating today brother not just a part not One Wing amen not just emphasizing one thing that's right oh I know our missionary deals we got you know we get them believe the message okay believe serpent seed all right now be baptized in Jesus name and never take them on to the baptism of the Holy Ghost never pray him through just leave them there in a Sanctified condition if that my goodness my God don't we realize it ain't just baptizing them amen in water they got to be ized by the spirit and you've left out the main thing amen now brother brandham talked about them in those days saying Revival in our time back this that and the other he said they hadn't recognize the Awakening of the bride and I got I I got different things that we could go on but remember he tells us in streetport one of the last things imparted imparted after saying I'm looking for the come the the Lord I'm not looking for Revival in the same sermon he says he said uh it can't go on like this it's got to be something and it's moving right now friend it's on the move is on for the bride that's the truth that's thus saith the Lord so the bride's Revival is a word Revival but it's a not a dead letter but a letter but a word that lives as we said we need today quoting the prophet an opening of the word that lives amen that he's the same yesterday today and forever so it must take on flesh and he and he said until the church becomes both Dynamics and mechanics and the spirit of God that moved him to do the same things that he did if he hit on 16 cylinders so will the bride if he said in John 14:12 he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also I'll give him a charge of my Dynamics and his mechanics that the world won't be able to with stand it now raising up in the last day the Dynamics and mechanics together the mechanics without the Dynamics no good neither is the Dynamics without the mechanics you can scream and shout and jump up and down all you want to and deny his word it won't do any good amen we got to fulfill the Great Commission one thing brother Bram told us in invisible Union the bride he said the Great Commission has not been fulfilled and he said it take the opening of The Seven Seals to fulfill it he said you know because he said you know they can't take even part of the word how in the world can they take the opening of these Seven Seals so he said so that means that it's on your shoulders and mine to fulfill the Great Commission and the Great Commission is to preach the gospel and these signs shall follow them that believe in my name they shall cast out devils they will speak with new tongues is that right amen go you can go through the restoration of the brid tree and brother BR over again and spoken words Original Seed the the different revivals he said the formals had had their Revival and the Pentecostals had there but then he said the word will produce a Revival the word's going to bring Sons and Daughters of God are you with me the bride must prod bride tree must produce the fruit of the groom amen now then I'm going to sum it up just for you just in these next couple of minutes I want you just to get several thoughts brother brandom weaves all the way he starts in Jeffersonville with this so it's to us and then all the way through everywhere that he goes to the country he preaches he preaches two scenarios that he painted in sermons like be not afraid gowake Jesus testimony on the sea and he talks about after coming to the great Revival and they're tested they out on the sea and they're testifying about the velia meetings oh yeah about the how God moved in Chicago how God did this and how God that yeah I'm paraphrasing that so you know I'm trying to bring it current yes cuz they were testifying on the sea you see that blind man that was healed there and pul shalom shalom and all of this but you know we come through this great Revival and there's two scenarios two things that are happening one people have left on the journey without him that's right two Jesus for others Jesus is in their boat but but he's asleep and needs to be awakened two things some went without him they don't have him at all and when he comes they're scared of him it's fanaticism we don't want what happened on the day of Pentecost we got something different from that brother Brandon said it'll it'll produce exactly what was in Acts to that's right the others they got Jesus but they let him go to sleep he needs to be awakened we're in the storm yes we need an Awakening amen of Jesus in our lives yes sir oh yeah we were Awakening we've got the Awakening of the Bride we recognized Seven Seals are open these Mysteries are revealed and we got all these truths and all these mystery truths and yeah we got that but Jesus is asleep storms in in your churches yes storms in your homes storms around the country yes and you need Jesus awaken that's in you amen amen here's another thing starting in Jeffersonville he preaches a sermon a deceive Church by the world and from there he preaches just once more Lord and across the country he is telling us that there's a new crop that old blind Samson in his wretched condition to church that there's still a possibility of a Revival and he says and once more they don't realize it that there's a possibility of Revival they don't realize the possibility they hadn't caught the vision yet yes we're not going to have another isusa Street yes we I know we are not going to go through another Divine Healing meeting and movement as much as personally I'd love to have it oh yes come on Amen but listen friend that's not what's promised but there is possibility of Revival because listen it's not a Revival that Tim pu and evening light Tabernacle has started it happened because of the opening of The Seven Seals and the mysteries of God revealed the Thunder spoke out and it was calling for the bride out of the church you said well we need unity in the church brother Tim what what we need is listen brother bam was crying Unity where the Baptist could meet and the Presbyterian the Catholic how many is there anybody in here that was formerly Catholic raise your hand no Baptist formerly B what one Baptist anybody Presbyterian cathol or Pentecostal denomination anybody else okay there's another anybody okay there you are and we're all meeting under the same roof yes the vision brother Bram had of that Unity is been a gathering out of denomination sitting right in your churches that's right where that they're all together now under one umbrella of one headship and that's Christ amen and there's possibility of Revival yes listen but you got to die to your pride yes amen reason we hold on to a lot of things is because old stinking Pride you got to die to the things of the world need a full surrenderance we need a Revival in the Pulpit before we can expect Revival in the Pew amen we need a coming back and a molding yes and saying God bring back that first love in my life yes yes I got to be willing to pay the price there is possibility of a real Revival you can have it personally what we brother brandham said then why Christ speak and I've quoted it to you he says we need a repentance we need a Revival I'm saying this myself how can I over come he says I'm preaching this sermon because I think it's a time that we should never let the spirit of Revival die how can I overcome well read these books on psychology I tell you what these are some self-help thing I'll give you seven steps of how to get rid of pornography we'll have a seminar of 78 days that won't work church amen it won't work preachers what's going to work is a dying out to sin you know to dying out and coming back to God in a real Revival fire in your own heart and you to preach life dead sermons kill and dead preachers give out dead sermons I'm not talking about you I'm talking about myself not even pointing fingers your way I'm not pointing out anybody individual or any certain group I'm just saying God we all need Revival in the ministry yes yes so there can be Revival in the pure amen we need a real dedication brother Bradon preached that on how can I overcome he said that's the way Christians are becoming they're dead in their sins and trespasses and they become Doty like an old log that he C tried to cross over and he just fell apart he said laying right there in the Stream of life right where the Water of Life is and rottens twice as quick and you'll have them on your pews and sit right there where the word's going for the pure word the holy the word that God sent to a prophet coming right through your pulpit and they'll die right in the Pew because they're not connected to life the greatest goal you ought to have for your church is to see it filled with the spirit we got the mechanics but the Dynamics of this church will be a refilling of the Holy Ghost it's time brother we ask God for a refilling amen sir is there hope for Revival yes sir I want to believe that men like you are hoped for that Revival because it's not going to end in a secular intellectual manner it's going to end with the supernatural display and you you talk about a Divine Healing Revival you haven't heard sir or seen nothing Hallelujah like what's coming you say brother Tim you've just read us listen we're not going to just see partial healings that's right someone with a bad heart give a new heart or a healed heart and somebody 50y old healed still a 50 year old we're going to see gray hair come back to the right C amen we're going to see old age away yes we're going to be transformed in a moment a twinkling of an eye it is the greatest Divine Healing movement that has ever been lays right in front of you yes yes that's the TR where even those who are mere fragments of dust will raise from The Seven Ages whole again yes Hallelujah God bless you Brothers thank you for letting me deliver my heart that's what brings Unity be filled with the spirit your lamps trimmed and [Applause] clear father I'm so thankful you let our brother get out of the way Lord cuz I saw Jesus here today and so father we thank you for that we thank you for this wonderful provision that the Saints here in bethl Tabernacle has provided for us and father we ask you bless and sanctify to our bodies and Lord Jesus as we go out there and sit around and fellowship around the natural food may we not lose what we've just heard in Jesus name we pray amen amen
