be all for the music this morning if you have your Bibles I'd like for you to turn with us you can unel follows and everything that he got his he got involved in was trouble on every hand and his mom and dad said why do you have to go down amongst those Philistines uncircumcised when we have daughters amongst your brethren and it grieve their heart and but if you go on down into the that's in in uh to the next verse it says but they did not know that it was of the Lord because God sought an occasion against the Philistines SC because they had dominion over the children of Israel everything was for God's purpose and his plan and we look at as we're going through it we're like oh my goodness I can't I can't handle this but as you're going through it knowing that there's a purpose and a plan for everything you in your life that God has now some people when hard times come um I had a brother in the message who told me that he lost his son and he said that what happened to him is he just gave up on everything he quit going to church quit talking to people he he didn't want to even be around any believers and that's what'll happen sometimes and what I wanted to talk about is is the world it'll tell you um when you listen to a song or you watch a movie or you see something like that it says well pick up a bottle go to an old bar stool I'll tell it to the old Long Tall cold beer I'll talk I'll talk to that one or I'll talk to the liquor glass or I'll talk to this that and other and that's the answer that the devil wants you to take when a hard time comes he wants you to turn to everything except exep for God if he can put a peel in your hand or somebody says have you got a cigarette maybe when they're nervous see it's these kind of things that'll calm your nerves but brother bam said there's not a pill that can take away that nervousness and we know it's spiritual warfare and the devil puts things in your life to throw you off track oh but what the enemy meant for evil God meant it for good he can't win either way he's a defeated foe from the word go just going through the motions that's right we have to believe amen now there's something that took place in brother brandom's life we wonder why these things have to be my heading on this one is called the danger zone so now the what is the trouble so now so what see so what brother ramam said now there was the hardest and most treacherous time of my life taken from the life story Sharon Rose was laying dying her eyes crossed she was suffering so hard and he said that he prayed and it was like a black sheet came down God wouldn't hear his prayer he said that was the most treacherous time of my life cuz I want to tell you something you're going to go through something your life you are going to get a knock like you've never got before and don't wait till that time to find out where you stand make sure your Hope Is Anchored In nothing less than Jesus Christ because it'll knock you for a loop it'll Knock You Plum out and don't look at somebody who maybe it didn't happen to and say well they're a Superman they're a lot stronger than I am like I told my son the other day I said when you go to the gym and you're a big old boy you might can pick up deadlift 400 pounds or something like that but another fellow might come in like my size I might not be able to get up maybe 200 pounds or something does that make me a less person than him or any is he any better than I am no what it means is that he has put his body through more stress in life because the way that your muscles get stronger is to put them under stress am and that goes the same for your spiritual Constitution if everything's a flowery bed of ease you're going to be just a tub of jelly see but God's got to put you through the ringer sometimes he's got to put you through stress in your life that makes you a stronger person you take an older man maybe in the Hard Knocks are coming and a young man he's just shaking he don't know what to do about it and I told him I said I'm older than you are I've been through a lot more I've been a don't mean I'm no better than you are but I've had the Hard Knocks I've got knocked down so many times and had to get right back up again but that's life and that's a training ground for us that's boot camp you're not going into battle until you go to boot camp gotta go through the training that's right gotta go through that strength training you got to go through the endurance training and God is not going to put anything on you unless you're ready for it now is that right so be ready because it's coming now brother random said this now there was the hardest and most treacherous time of my life when I raised up and looked at her and I thought Satan put in my mind well you mean as hard as you've preached see he's having a pity party feeling sorry for your there devil oh he loves that that's one party he can throw he can give you a pity party oh yeah and that's a danger zone because when you're going through grief and you're going through a hard trial it's a lot feels a whole lot better to turn that grief into anger yeah it's easier to deal with if you can blame somebody you can blame somebody or you can blame something amen you know in this world today accidents just don't happen somebody's always to blame see always got to blame somebody for something and in that little place right there of grief that you're hurting so bad you want to turn that it's so easy to turn it to anger but let me tell you that's the danger zone that's where Satan lives right there when that thing when you get to that point and you will one day you'll get to that point always remember to turn that thing over to God look at what brother brandham did right here Satan put in my mind well you mean as hard as you preached and the way you've lived now when it comes to your own baby he'll turn you down and I said that's right if he can't save my baby then I can't see he almost listen to what the devil had to say wow then I stopped I just didn't know what to do and he said I said Lord you gave her to me and you taken her away blessed be the name of the Lord if you take even me I'll still love you now that's the so what that's the that's the danger zone that the devil has for all of us because what'll happen if you let that slide over to the anger side yes there's a there's a there's a place in there there that you're not going to be able to do anything without anger that's where Vengeance comes from that's where hatred comes from malice and all these things so you can't vent it you can't get revenge what are you going to do so then you get depressed because really depression is is anger it's an unmet need in your life it's an unmet expectation realistic expectation that becomes anger then that turns into depression and that depression it can take you down so low it'll pull you away from fellowship you won't want to talk to nobody you won't want to go to church you won't want to put on a tape you don't want to sing you don't want to play M you don't want to do any of the things that you used to do but that's what the devil wants you to do that's exactly as good as he would have it to have you in a dark place in a deep dark place that's where that that's where the devil lives see and then what happens if you can't get rid of that depression and then that anger is built with it and that self-pity oh woe is me I deserve better than this I don't deserve to be going through this I wanted more time with him I wanted I I I I I it's all about me when you start thinking about oh God I claimed him for you in the name of Jesus Christ I have an assurance My Hope Is Anchored In nothing less I know one thing I I want to give this testimony you believe that God can give you a a message from 15 years before it ever even happens we were up in uh brother Roy Shrewsberry and brother Billy Paul Brandon was there gave his testimony gave a wonderful just a moving testimony as as always just the Holy Spirit came down and brother Steve and brother Bobby was there and my wife and my children we were all there and my goodness my son Joseph was down he got in the floor and he had hands up just trembling praising God about 11 years old 12 years old how that when he went up after the service brother Billy Paul was there and he had his Bible and he took his Bible and went up and said brother Billy I want you to sign my Bible and brother Billy Paul signed it around on the fly leaf there and and so the other day um about a month ago when he passed I was been up all night laying there all night oh my I just you couldn't go to I couldn't go to sleep I just kept seeing him in in my mind amen I get up and I I go I I'm thinking about when brother Brandon went beyond the curtain of time and I was thinking about that and how that when he was there and and he he said when I got there he said you know all the millions of people came running to him they said oh our precious brother and they said one day when Jesus comes we'll go back to Earth and you'll be judged for what you've preached and when you're accepted and if you're accepted which you will be then you'll present us to him as trophies of your ministry and he said about that time and a voice said press the battle and he looked down he he felt something lick his hand and there was a dog right there that was old Fritz his hunting dog and he heard something nicker and there was his horse now if you go back and you remember when Danny Henry had a he was a brother brandom said he was just a um Baptist member of the Full Gospel businessman didn't even know anything about the baptism of the Holy Ghost but he said he came up and got a hold of brother brandham and immediately started speaking in tongues in perfect French and it was it was interpreted by a un interpreter man named Victor leuk and he wrote it out and it was it was um there was like Witnesses is there three two or three other ones a woman came up and and different ones and it paraphrasing I I can't remember exactly what it said but said because you've chosen the hard way which is my way a great portion of Heaven awaits you what a reward I want to take that hard way don't you oh I'll take the way of the Lord's despise few greater portion of Heaven awaits you so when he got up when he went beyond the curtain of time and and you you'll have to go back and listen to it again it'll do your heart good and a voice spoke twice and said all that you ever loved and all that ever loved you will be here what a reward said it again all that you ever loved and all that ever loved you will be there well I remember that and I got up and I got his Bible and I picked up the Bible and I opened up the fly leaf and brother Billy P had signed his name brother Billy Paul brandham and under it he' wrote Matthew 10:41 brother can you pull that up on the screen Matthew 10:41 I didn't even know what it was I've read it but when it comes up I want you to read it with me and it was like the Lord just confirming something to me that he had wrote his Bible I guess that was probably back probably 10 years before I guess it was about 10 years and it was just a confirmation to me you know sometimes the Lord just gives you things on purpose don't he and it's just for you amen whenever it comes up brother is that there it is he that receiveth a prophet in the name of a prophet shall receive a prophet's reward he that receiveth a righteous man in the name of a righteous man shall receive a righteous man's reward I put that on my son's grave marker because I believe that if we receive the word of this hour we'll be beneficiaries of that same reward like brother Jason said that same faith that you have in your heart for your loved one even if you die and go by way of the Grave when you come up that faith is still Al amen he said I believe what is the Holy Ghost he said there'll be a power working in this church one day that'll be so powerful the Holy Ghost will be moving it'll literally draw the Dead from the graves Christ in us he's looking for empty vessels to fill we got to empty out first remember the story of Elisha when the widow woman her husband died and her sons were going to be sold to pay the debt said go get vessels all this all we got go borrow some get all you can get fill it up God's looking for empty vessels this morning but we got to empty out of everything that's not like him amen amen Lord help me covered that already so now what do we do now what that's so what we had what so what now what so we know what the danger is what do we do about it how do we avoid falling into that trap yes you know you can benefit from counselors even even Solomon said that in a multitude of counselors we have safety I believe in that I believe we need to if you're going through something find somebody who can you can talk to and you can you know Godly men I'm not talking about these rep probates out there but I mean Godly men and women somebody who's been through the trials and been through the tribulations and and and you know I'll listen to people even on the radio some of these ministers and and I'll listen to these men I'm like I'm I'm thinking myself why do I enjoy them me and my wife were talking about that why do I enjoy them so much they don't know the truth like like we know it but my soul can really benefit from what they're saying and I'll tell you what it comes down to they may not have the knowledge but the men have wisdom and they've been through some of of the things they've been through the hard knocks and as much as they know they have they have come through the fire so to speak and they have something to offer Amen brother Braham said Billy Graham had the Holy Ghost but he was anointed and he was ordained to do what he did he couldn't do what brother brandom did Brother brandom couldn't do what he did he was in a certain place and he stayed in his position amen now we can talk about these issues that we're having we can we can go through all kind of things but we got to realize there's only one relief from the pain amen and that's God he's the only way now we we know that in on in the book of Hebrews chapter 11 it says without faith it is impossible to please him for he that cometh to God must believe that he is amen comma and he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him so you must believe first off that God is Not was not will be but he is right now he is the god of now he told even he even told that to Moses I am that I am not I will be or or I was but he is the ever present tense God right now to meet the need that you have and you must believe that it won't do you a bit of good to get on your knees and say well this might work no no no You Must Believe even as Paul said that the weapons that we pick up every day that we have is the is the breastplate of righteousness amen oh put it on every morning put on the helmet of salvation but he said this above all what is it the shield of Faith because that's what operates all the rest of them you've got to have faith if a little child gets a thorn in its finger if it don't think it mama can help it it won't go to Mama it won't go to Daddy but it must believe that Daddy can help that take that thorn out oh what a terrible thing that would be for a child to not have the confidence in its own father that Daddy I got a splinter can you help me get it out see a lot of times we don't go to God we don't take like the song says have we trials and temptations is there trouble anywhere take it to the Lord in prayer see we've got to take it to him and I know that sounds simple but when you're going through the battle and you're reing your hands and walking the floor and you don't know what to do with yourself you better remember where to take that grief too take that anger too it's got to go somewhere don't let it stay inside because it'll Fester and it'll grow into something that's ugly it will it'll turn into something real bad and and you'll well I've done said that it'll pull you away it'll it'll put it fill your life with bitterness and anger amen he is the I am that I am so what do we do we've got to give him everything that's right cast all your cares upon Him for he carth for you you got to believe that he does and and when you're praying I'll go through days sometimes it hits you and you're you're going through uh regret sorrow pain anger hopelessness all these feelings every one of them take it to the Lord in prayer let me tell you something when you're going through that if you're maybe it don't have to be losing a loved one it could be financial trouble you want to talk about something that'll weigh on your mind mind more than almost anything is when you can't pay your bills or your your job's in Jeopardy you might be losing your home or something like that's going on it'll shake you and you just can't hardly get no rest or no peace or nothing say God this is this is stronger than I can do this is stronger than I can handle it's too strong for me God help me that's what God wants you to do sometimes he allows things to come into your life just to drive you to him they got I can't do this and and just say oh God I'll give it to you in the name of Jesus Christ you may not feel immediate relief I'm not GNA promise that you will but I tell you what if you do it over and you do it over again that's right God will replace that grief with joy he'll replace that anger with happiness he'll replace that that sadness with oh my just exaltation the next time somebody sees you your have hands lifted up you'll be praising His holy name because the devil wants to get you down into a place to where you feel like that you are nobody and you're nothing tell another thing he'll do to you he'll remind you of your past is that right oh me and brother Jason were talking in the back and I heard this also too that the psychologists are talking and how they had all this out there that positive thinking the power of positive thinking it's so good well that ain't that's okay but if you got this negativity over here you're just piling positive on top of it you still got negativity there the best thing to do is get rid of the negative feelings the negative thoughts empty out of those things you you you can take you say well I can't do it God can that's right say God I can't do help me with this negative thought that I've got I'm always thinking negative about myself I'm worried about about the end of the world I'm worried about making this bill I'm worried about getting sick or cancer or this that and other God take these things from me and restore unto me give me that joy that I need the joy of my salvation CU he promised that he would do it he's the god of our refuge amen he is our refuge and that's the title of this message this morning my refuge amen it's not in a bottle it's not in a pel it's not in a self-help program it's not in all these things that people do but take it to God go straight to him say oh God I give this to you I can't handle it I can't hold it anymore and he said come unto me all ye that are heavy laden I'll give you rest but we got to believe that he'll take it from us see comes back down to faith without faith it's impossible to please him so we've got to believe that he'll do it now here's something else the devil would do see the God is also the god of your past amen as we're seeing now in the as the nation is progressing we see how that that they are trying to rewrite history and and there's a there's a funny thing about that because if you do it in the negative if you rewrite history and and you and you present a different version of historical facts you can literally steer the future of a Nation you can steer the direction that the nation goes in by rewriting what the past was right because if if just take Germany if they continually look back in the past with a uh a a wonderful view of Nazism and they look back in the past and said oh the Glory Days of the Nazi party then what would the future look like they would be steering to the same direction from where they came from but they had to look back into the past and see what a terrible thing that was and it steered the country into a completely different direction as far away from the past as it was see and they're doing that with America now in the negative they're taking all of the principles that were Godly and they're saying oh it was a bunch of racist bigots that started the country and so now it's tainted everything they've written including the Constitution so all these things should be changed by a new enlightened group of people who are running the country nowadays and that's the direction that it's moving into see so you can take that in a positive and a negative but now let's take it into a a positive view amen and let's see what God wants you to see about your own life and about your own past because there's one thing I found out is that I know that if a child is abused as a child and and specifically molested um that child will grow up with a tainted view of its own self it'll grow up with guilt and it'll grow up with depression and it'll manifest itself in drug use and promiscuity and all kinds of of terrible things that it had nothing to do with it was not its fault it was a victim in the affair but they're looking at what happened to them with adult eyes when what happened to them they were a child and Paul said when I was a child I thought as a child but you're looking at yourself and you're condemning yourself for what what happened to you back then see and you'll grow up thinking but when you realize that I I was a victim in that I had nothing to do with that then you're set free from that thing and then you can go on and then you know that God has set you free I had nothing to do with that the guilt is gone guilt of the past and it's what is where is the guilt then put back on to the one who did it to start with that goes for you and I with a life of sin that we had Satan might try to come and condemn you look at what you did look at the life you lived look at all the things that you did oh but let's put that guilt right back on the one where it come from had nothing to do with me Satan you tricked me into it you T me into it I got out there yeah I strayed away but thank God GL he called my name I'm not carrying the guilt anymore I'm not carrying I'm not carrying anymore back on the devil where it belongs amen praise be to God do you have that P could you find that picture you couldn't find it that's okay brother brandom well this is a this is a uh brother could you get my phone off the desk back there I I want to show it I might be able to this is a poem by Cory tan boom he was a holocaust Survivor talk about going through some hard times amen me you and I haven't hardly seen anything her whole bethl Tabernacle sound booth at gmail.com well this is the poem that she wrote or I don't know if she wrote it but this is the one she would give says life is but a weaving my life is but a weaving between my God and me I cannot choose the colors he weaveth steadily oftimes he weaveth sorrow and I and Foolish Pride forget he sees upper and I the underside till the loom is silent and the shuttle cease to fly will God unroll the canvas and reveal the reason why see if I can find that picture you might be able to see it from my phone it's it I think I it's I don't know if you can see this it's uh it's kind of a mess ain't it can you see that just colors you see that some of you might have seen this before but it's just an old mess of colors and red and green and all kinds of things like that but there's something that takes place can y'all see it back there you see there's something that takes place in the life of a believer that believes in what God can do it says God unrolls the canvas and reveal the reason why the dark threads are as needful as the Weaver's skillful hand as the threads of gold and silver in the pattern he has planned he knows he loves he cares nothing this truth condemn he gives the very best to those who trust him now that was the side that we see that's our life that's that's the life that we're looking at all we see is a mess we see the trials we don't understand why but the flip side that was a tapestry and the flip side of that tapestry is what God is weaving for us can you see that there's the crown right there but that's the flip side of it the back side is a jumbled mess it's just nasty looking old strings that's your life that's your trials that's your troubles but what God is weaving in your life right now is a Crown of Glory first Peter when the chief 54 says when the chief Shepherd shall appear you shall receive a Crown of Glory fadeth not way I'm ready for the chief Shepherd to come at you oh even so come Lord Jesus come quickly Lord Jesus brother brandom said this on the life story he said some people say he made mistakes that's fine that's okay he was a man I'm a man Elijah was a man John the Baptist was a man brother Bram said and may all my mistakes in life only be a stepping stone to others W so is it okay if you made mistakes that's all right with me if it'll be a stepping stone for me that would bring them closer to thee granted Lord May Sinners see the footprints on the sands of time may they be led to thee in Psalms 46 it says God is our refuge and strength very present help and trouble therefore will we not fear though the Earth be removed though the mountains be carried into the midst of the sea and then the 10th verse it says be still and know that I am God I will be exalted among the Heathen I will be exalted in the Earth the Lord of hosts is with us the god of Jacob is our refuge he's our refuge you love him this morning that's all I have I think that's enough God is our refuge he's my strength He's My Hope and I I pray that he's every one of your hope that when the Trials come when when the when the Temptations come that you can breathe that holy name in prayer amen say God it's stronger than I am you're the god of my future you're the god of my past I give this grief to you I give this sadness to you I give this heartache to you I give all my trials all the things that that keeps me Lord from reaching that place where I need to be I I want to get close now we sing that song we say Lord whatever it takes whatever it takes Lord to draw closer to you but I wonder how many of us really know what we're singing you you really get oh way wake up call when it happens when it comes down your way when I found it out I said the Lord gives and the Lord takes away blessed be the name of the Lord there nothing within I tell you what I if it was me I'd be a a a sobbing wreck somewhere but it's God who who holds you it's God who lifts you up and when you make him the center of your life amen he can take all the hurt he can take all the pain why he took it into himself you know there's another scripture there's two times in the Bible where it said that somebody's somebody was almost vexed to death almost to death one was was Samson when Delila was was wearing upon him and wearing upon him and he loved her but she didn't love him and and she had him down and and and he was so infatuated with her and he and she kept saying you you you've mocked me and and you won't tell me your secret the devil wants to know your secret this morning he wants to know everything what makes you tick he wants to know how to get your strength from you and that's what she was doing to him and the Bible says that she vexed his soul unto death that he wanted to die he couldn't handle it he wanted to kill himself that he got into such a state from her bewitching and her her um what Jezebel spirit is all it is you want to talk about the spirits they don't die the Bible talks about seven spirits of God in Revelation are there seven gods no it's the seven manifestations of the same spirit of God and so is that devil of Jezebel who was manifested in Jezebel manifested in Delilah manifested in herodias and manifested in this day also to try to Temp the sons of God and the daughters of God away from the kingdom of God Satan will work and he'll do everything he can let me tell you something there's another scripture in the Bible where it said another man who was sorrowed unto death that was Jesus in The Garden of Gethsemane he said I'm sorrowful even unto death not that he wanted to die but that he had to take death on him how was it that the author of Life The Giver of of life and the author of Holiness and righteousness had to take my unrighteousness upon him and my death he stood in my stad amen and he took it upon himself oh God help me this morning God I I I'm sorry that you did that but I'm so glad that you did and I give you all my grief I give you my sorrow I give you you're the god of my tomorrow you're the god of my past and I give everything to you this morning amen let me tell you something there's brother BR said that that you say well how how did how did Samson get into such a a position to where he wanted to die brother bandom said this when them young women come down the hallway he was up in Canada and they were drinking wearing their under clothes and saying kicked up their leg said whoopee this is life brother random said it's not life he said I took him by the hand and said it's death you don't realize what you're doing amen he said that kind of a lifestyle he said well will lead you to Suicide it'll pull you so far away from God and hopelessness and the devil wants to get you out there and even lead you to put your gun put a gun to your head you don't think that's what happened to Samson he got into such a place that he wanted to die he didn't care he wanted her so much that if I can't have her I don't even want to live she's all and I'll give her the secret see gave it up Satan will get you to a place you may not get weak the first day you leave church maybe not even this first week or the first month but just like you take an old like we had a wood stove and you take a hot coal out of that wood stove and it's bright and it's hot and it's burning you take that coal out of that stove and it's still hot and it's bright and it's burning you set it over here on the Hearth give it just a minute it'll get darker darker darker finally just an old lump of coal nothing no life no heat no nothing back in it see and that's a Believer if God if the devil can take you out of church and get you away from Believers and get you out from among the fellowship now he's got you out on his grounds the Sheep leaves the sheep fold the Wolves will come out long as you stay in that sheep fold you're safe there's safety stay in that Sheepfold don't let him draw you out there the devil's got every kind of Temptation you could imagine he's got it I'm going come back here and preach the god the return of the Goddess she's come back she's back in in full swing let me tell you something and I'm not picking on women let me tell you something miss the men are are the real ones that are worshiping that thing brother Bram said that the goddess of America is a naked female men are worshiping following after it and she's loving that worship and receiving that worship and accepting that worship amen well I said I was going to come back and preach it but I I better come back [Laughter] amen my my well let's stand musicians come I want to sing that song you are my refuge brother Matt can you come sing that for me brother you're my refuge You're My Sanctuary when I feel afraid you're my Hiding Place you are my ref you are my [Music] S feel Lord you my oh you are my and when the storm is Raging underneath your wings I'll rejoice and say you

say you are my refuge you are my ref You Are My [Music] Sanctuary when I feel afraid you're my hiding place you are my refuge and when the storm is Raging underneath your wings I rejoice and say you are my refuge amen hallelujah am man just keep that or if he switches that's fine but otherwise you can keep that going just quietly brother Andrew you know I I was thinking about when the critic came to brother brandham and and he tried to say that you know there is no God and uh there there is no Divine Healing there is there are no Miracles there are no Supernatural power and brother brandham just said to him you come too late late for that buddy he said you might have you might have told me that a few years ago he said but you you too late now he said I hav been all around the world he said I done experienced it I've seen it you remember even even by the time he went through that deep dark trial of losing his family and he said Satan didn't try to tell me there was no God he because I'd already met him he said he didn't try to tell me there was no God he he tried to tell me but he don't care about you yeah and you know there's something about taking up a topic and speaking from your heart from experience oh yeah I thought about brother Joe in that sermon I just kept it going through my mind this is a man that's speaking from experience you know when somebody can bring something doctrinally and it might be true but it's not the same thing it's just not the same thing you can't argue with a man who's been there and had that happen you know cuz it happened to him and I was thinking about him and sister Becky as they were singing and what a what a jubilent what a testimony that is what a slap to the face of the enemy yes my you know I thought about a another servant of God you talking about Samson you're talking about the Lord Jesus I thought about Paul Paul got to a point in his life he said we despaired of life yes that's right despaired of life as far as Paul was concerned it was just over there was no way to survive it it was just too too too bad Paul said to the church at Corinthia we are troubled on every side yet not distressed we are perplexed but not in despair persecuted he didn't deny the persecution but not for forsaken cast down that's true that can happen but not destroyed yes always bearing about in the in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our [Music] body you know you know why Paul could have that kind of an attitude you know where his strength came from to admit to all of that distress and trouble and perplexity persecution cast down and yet he's not destroyed he's not in despair he's he he he it's just the dying of the Lord Jesus Christ he's not forsaken he's not destroyed and the reason is found where he says in verse six right right ahead of saying all of that he said for God who commanded the light to shine out of Darkness hath shined in our hearts oh to do what to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ I wonder today if we're willing to bring glory to God in our lives he makes a point in the seventh verse I'll read it to you from the New Living Translation now we have this light shining in our [Music] hearts but listen to this honesty but we ourselves are like fragile clay jars containing this great treasure this makes it clear that our great power is from God not from ourselves how how are you how is Paul Still Standing he's a fragile human that's a fragile human but he's still standing I'm still standing you're still standing we're still believing yes we're fragile yes life is that way sometimes you feel like a shattered clay vessel but oh I'm here to tell you something friends if the light of God is shining in your heart hallu I wonder if you know that way to get to God brother Joe that was such a amazing Point said when you come into those kinds of times you know you you bring all your cares to the Lord you take it to the Lord in prayer but it's not just a an exercise a physical exercise when you go in real prayer you know something friends when you go in real prayer you go somewhere brother Ram talked about that you travel somewhere you might still be in a room you're still in trapped in these Dimensions but you the real you goes somewhere and you lift yourself up into the atmospheres of God how many prayer warriors know that to be a fact you hear things and see things you get a strength that you can't account for Hallelujah and as brother Joe was saying in times of trouble I hope you know how to get back there I hope you know the way to get back if you're practiced if you're if you're stud if you think about it if you if if prayer really means something to you you know my my dad was almost inexplicably able anywhere he had ever been one time he could get back to he didn't need a map he could tell you exactly how to get there and the roads and the direction and what you do and where you turn and having only went there one time I mean we'd go into big Metropolis go into California go into LA and we' go back there and he just knew exactly how to get and where to go and it was almost photographic but it's because he paid attention and he knew how to get back there I why don't you bow your heads with me today all over the building do you know the way into the presence of God do you know friends the way when the Troubles of Life come and you may be in here today in plenty of troubles in your life do you know how to get back there have you been there before say I've been there I know how to get there then go there and just give him that burden and if you don't know how to get there let me pray for you right now maybe you want to slip up a hand to the Lord and say Lord help me to know how to find you in prayer help me to know how where you are I want to job said oh if I could just find his house I would crawl up on his porch and I would knock on his door and he wouldn't turn me way he would strengthen me oh Hallelujah Lord hands honest hands up over the building Lord we need to know that way to you oh God we need to know in times of trouble we are tossed about Lord and and there's and we're distressed and we're perplexed and we're persecuted and hard times and hard trials and and real trials Lord that happened to us in real time and we need to know not just just know to bring it to you but we need to know how to find you help us today Lord deal with Honest Hearts today maybe there's some here that don't know the way clearly I pray you will open it before them Lord be that great direction finder Lord let that Holy Spirit that's what you promised that's what you said Lord that when he the Holy Ghost comes he will lead you he will guide you so Lord be our guide today be that leader that leads us into the word leads us into the presence of God and help us I thank you for this service I thank you for your servant I thank you for his willingness Lord to make himself vulnerable and to open his heart and to speak honestly from a very painful experience that's still very painful we've had others Lord in here who have walked that painful path I pray for them Lord God I pray that you will help us Master to leave all of our burdens with you you said come unto me come unto me ye that are weary and heavy laden I will give you rest we love you Lord for your truth we love you for your presence in our midst I pray that the young and old know how to find you I pray these teenagers lord they're young many of them they haven't
