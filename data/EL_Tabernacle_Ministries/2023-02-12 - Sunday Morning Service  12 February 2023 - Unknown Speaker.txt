Jesus to be like Jesus there is nobody that can be like Jesus unless you come in love in you [Applause] there is no pastor there is no prophet there is no and a possible not even had garage School can match him all of us wants to be like him [Applause] Muhammad says I've got to confess myself that I committed today that I committed yesterday and that I'm committing in the future and he says but Jesus Christ is accepted in this world and the world to come [Applause] because he never prayed to God to forgive him send his sons because he never sent these garbage and how are you gonna know you love him do you want to know how you know you love him it's only one way that you can know that you love him he says if you love me and keep my commands keep my word [Applause] when you keep his word then you ought to know you love him last night we just had his word on the screen that was only my commands and if you keep those Commandments brother Branham told you to do it don't only read the quotes don't only quote the word we're not only hearers of the world we are doers of the word if he says renewable the new birth is a mess you don't worry about your pompadoo you don't worry about your Liz Taylor's perfume if he slays me and I get up there and I look a mess let me look amazing as long as I'm fulfill the word that I know I love him [Applause] how do you know that he loves you how do you know that he loves you now you know when you keep the word then you love him but how do you know how does he love you if he'll if he gives you the Holy Ghost it's a gift [Music] who knows he loves you how many of you got the holy ghosts [Music] [Applause] amen then he loves you he doesn't give it to anybody it's a gift you don't give a gift to everybody [Applause] that's why [Applause] it's not everybody that has this gift foreign the whole of Israel millions of Jews there's only going to be 144. very loves and seals so El Tabernacle how fortunate are we to have the Holy Ghost [Applause] I want to thank the brother that's in there SMS is in last night from Brazil even Botswana I didn't even mention Botswana last night even from Botswana I think by by 11 o'clock last night we had 1 500 viewers across the world I they never knew about langa but since we came here the whole world knows about London [Applause] and I thank God for the um those pastors out in Brazil that also sent in I don't know they must have had an interpreter there because every time they just say Gloria's [Applause] so we want to thank so many people that has I remember it's not the LT of an echo because we had services in every Church we're out of an equally so they were in church this is outside people [Applause] no one is saying if anybody in Cape Town would like to counter that I spoke last night I mean it's not my words it's brother branham's words [Applause] if they do count it you just urge me to come back again and straighten out but it will only be a fool that tries to come up against those quotes were laid down last night they can only do one thing [Applause] is repent and obey the quotes [Applause] that's why that's why I am not concerned when the people says well we got the word we got the word fine everybody's got the word even Rome's got all the tapes they all say have the word the devil also has the word in Matthew 4. 3 when he quoted back to the word the word everybody's not aware that's why I tell you this year the word is dead this word was in the beginning so let them preach in the beginning the word but we preached before the beginning [Applause] you're going to have a life first before the baby talk he needs to be alive and after a couple of months when his brain starts developing through his Spirit the brain is Spirit [Applause] than when the spirit is developed then the word come [Applause] so don't be taken up with people that speak about the word the word the word they don't even know what they're talking about [Applause] and then after your brain is developed your spirit is developed and you know because a word is a thought to express spirit where the spirit expresses the word if there's no spirit and the guys in saying he can't speak a proper word he misplaces the word because his spirit is deranged that's why if they misplace the word that means their spirit is deranged they matter misplaced dislocate [Applause] already preached already praised [Applause] the real world Jesus Christ right is Jesus the word and he only started to talk preach when he was 33 years old but he had to spread it all the time with him [Applause] amen I didn't touch my message so I'm going to try and touch it today [Applause] so let us just read the word of God in numbers again and what a blessing we had if you have given your heart to the Lord last night we we will be over anxious to baptize you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ over anxious and we welcome you in this family [Applause] numbers 13. and they came unto the brook of ashko and cut down from things a branch with one cluster of grapes and they bear it between two upon a staff they put a a pole between the classical grapes how could they miss it I wonder that just that one cluster of grapes how much wine does it make God is telling Israel now I am going to make you drunk when you come into the land [Music] [Applause] God hates a sober Church a sober Church you're always as splits because the guys use the coconut to try and catch you but a drunk guy is just happy you just want the grapes that's all [Applause] can you see how the natural types the spiritual this quote is in the natural and in Acts 2 is the spiritual there the wine came down so how can they say the in the land and they sober can't be two guys said to me to carry it two guys the old in the New Testament will be governed by the grapes and they brought off the pomegranates and are fixed father I thank you for the reading of your word I hand this word into your hands I pray that you'll give me strength and a sound mind to preach this morning I'm so happy that I could work for you Lord so happy that you chose me to work father I am even more happy and glad and joyous that I can see I'm not doing God a service without being his will or his word the fruits of the work is hanging on the tree in front of everybody I hand over this leading into your hands and I pray o God that you'll bless your people when I was a young man I asked you help me to help your people the Lord for 57 years you helped me and I could help your people pray that you'd undertake for me in Jesus name you may be seated amen the fruit of the land and I'd like to start where I finished off last night with a quotation that I told you I love this quotation so very much the uncertain sounds I even print little cards and gave it to the church I told them if you go out and you visit other churches you want to know whether the church is the right Church then that church will have this quote manifested if it's not this quotation then you're in the wrong place look for the church that's got this and I just want the El Tabernacle have you got this [Applause] because you said every time God has a church it'll be this type of a church was the Pentecostal Church a noisy Church positive don't care [Applause] amen and out of an echo I hate a sober person in the church I like a person that forgets about himself [Applause] we don't have a boring Church we don't get bored here why because life is emotions is that right is that what brother Brown says so if you have the life of Jesus Christ in your life then you'll be full of emotions you can't help but praise the Lord you can't help but have prayed through meetings you can't help but have a fasting and a prayer you can but help amen dance in front of your critics even if your neighbor is in the church she'll be shocked how you act in church if we have Baptist people they'll be shocked because this quote says every time God has a church it'll be this type of a church Cape Town there's nothing you can do if your church is not this type of a church you are in the wrong Church you better get to a church that has these Karl Marx amen where people is free and the Holy Ghost comes down he that the spirit sets free is free indeed we know more back then the Baptist amen we're in the Pentecostal age [Applause] thank you if the bishop said if the bishop says if the bishop says if the bishop brother Beckett says anything else brother Branham says he's a liar because this quote has no uncertain sounds amen that's called it's got a real sound because they came a sound from heaven like a rushing Mighty Winder amen and his sound like this quote I hear in this quote I want to tell you yes you are in this quote then let us rejoice and be glad for the lamb has made herself ready the spirit and the bride say come amen [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] then he says they all says well don't worry we've got the Holy Ghost we you know they preach on the Holy Ghost and they think that's all right to preach on the Holy Ghost but this quote knock everybody out he says if you say you got it if you say you got it the Bible Tabernacle says they've got it your brother Beckett says they've got it amen this is the evidence and the proof and the manifestation that you got it watch that brother bam says and you didn't act like that like what like the first church then how did the first church Act they spoke in pounds they danced they shouted [Applause] can you say Amen foreign act like that then there's something wrong with you there's something wrong there's something wrong with the bishop if you preach on the Holy Ghost and the people don't act like that then there's something wrong with him that's what the prophet says and I say what the prophet says so if the man preached on the Holy Ghost and say you've got the Holy Ghost and they never acted like that because brother pranam says that's the way Jesus acted he said Jesus acted that way amen so why don't they act that way but El Tabernacle you will act that way why because Jesus act that way why because Jesus is in you and if Jesus is in you you'll act that same way no other way no other baptism there's only one baptism and there's a baptism of the Holy Ghost and the baptism of the Holy Ghost is full of emotions brother pronounces foreign [Music] [Music] [Applause] that's exactly what it said what what said that's what the Bible says not Bible Tabernacle not brother Beckett with his Baptist manners the Bible says it's a Pentecostal Menace because Pentecost started without an end and it's going on here because it's unto you and to your children and your children's children amen as many as the Lord called here is as many as the Lord called and we are acting the same way we are in the Bible this is the Bible amen we don't quote it we live it foreign [Music] [Applause] then the question comes up then what is the Holy Ghost you know now without it he doesn't know you they that don't have the spirit is none of Jesus none none but now if we have it [Applause] we need to know what how you're going to get it [Applause] the world is again falling apart and boy is it falling apart not even the world the churches is falling apart not even the churches the message is falling apart not even a message the foolish virgins is falling apart [Applause] but not the bride that has the oil the oil the oil make sure you've got the oil now instead of having to pick up the having preachers we've got lecturers man knows the word they know the word that's why I told you don't come to tell me where you got the word the word but otherwise it says the man's got a word another place he says this morning everybody is preaching the word so we passed the stage of the word we're at the stage of fulfilling the way [Applause] we passed the stage where the word was on paper we write now in the paper is turned into flesh and the word became flesh brother Brahm says your place that quote is in your flesh if that quote say dance and you dance that quote is in your flesh it's been made manifest [Music] it says they can sit there and put it together in such a way that it's astounding how they can do it they know the mechanics Ethel knows the mechanics brother Beckett knows the mechanics but then that ain't the Dynamics the mechanics the word that's not the Dynamics it's a mechanics what does he say can you read it for me we want not the word because he's a prophet you already lay down the word so you don't want the word you want the mechanics to go with the Dynamics or you want the Dynamics to work in the mechanics because the mechanics is there I don't have to prove the mechanics brother Branham already proved the mechanics I need the Dynamics to make the mechanics move to actually switch on the car and because all right you ought to shout the truth down you ought to run around this bowling that God gave you the Dynamics to go with the mechanics and make it pleasure again that you can walk with the word amen and talk with the word it has become the Dynamics of God we need the Dynamics and if the spirit of Jesus dwells in you it's gonna Quicken your mortal body and the Rapture will go oh my God now you now you finish this quote for me you finish this quote for me I don't I don't think that went into the third dimension of hell [Applause] foreign [Music] [Applause] my mind couldn't grasp it that a great prophet like that one of the greatest outside Jesus Christ could stand up and say a thing like that I don't care about the Bible the mechanics [Applause] now if he don't care I don't care brother Beckett because I had it for 57 years I know it I know the mechanics and nobody can tell me about the mechanics I know the mechanics everybody knows the mechanics this morning in the churches even the Roman Catholic Church they're going to open the Bible and read the mechanics but don't sit there they'll have the mechanics but they cannot have the dynamic say man we need the dynamic Hallelujah and what do you need Hey Brother Branham says he wants to know the Dynamics how come you don't want to know it brother Beckett amen I want to know it because I want to be like the prophet [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh my [Applause] God can you imagine a proper says you want to know the Dynamics and little Pastor is just got nothing the Wonder Dynamics you make too much noise restoration I think page 34. brother Graham said you they say you make too much noise brother promises the Palm alone is it of the joy you're made too much noise [Applause] and what does he do it brings your joy unspeakable and what does it do they chase cigarettes out of your life and what does it do he Chase sin out of your life and what does he do he Chase these two things out of your life and what does he do it changes you from this and money devil amen and what does he do he changes from B want to be a bishop and you're not a bishop amen you're not even anything but you want to be that get the Holy Ghost then you'll know what you want to do what does he do that's what he does amen I love the old time Holy Ghost and the devil won't go near it that's all the reason people fear right it's good enough for me that's what he does amen oh Hallelujah I love the old-time Holy Ghost I love the old-time way I sing on my redeemer all the days of my life because I loved the old-time Dynamics amen and the Dynamics will make you run the Dynamics will strengthen your legs to jump a man that's what it will do it will make you stand on a street corner and Proclaim Jesus Christ as the king God of Our Lives amen [Applause] how do you know hey man let's take the next one reject Redemption in completion in joy they don't have joy anymore look at them sitting in Bible Tabernacle no joy and the Holy Ghost brings Joy I saw a brother sit here from Tabernacle just here amen with that brother standing and the whole time he just fit like this what's wrong with you guys that come from the Congo and UPS up South Africa you want to act like a bunch of white people we black people we like to toy toy man [Applause] [Music] when I see a black guy sitting like this I said this is a bird that's in a cage and proud of him since the cage is open and he doesn't want to fly out he loves the cage he will never get out of the cage but us as blacks Hallelujah we are brother we know [Music] can you say praise the Lord [Applause] now listen look what brother Brown says about the word look what he says about the word the one before this did we finish it no the one before this [Applause] oh yeah we finish it right now look what he says about the mechanics he says brother please read it just how you said I'm reading the wrong thing [Music] [Applause] [Music] foreign that you can't even get up from your seat and say Amen brother bear said get up there and pick your heels together get a little Dynamics into your fifth word amen fast enough by the word freshen up by the word pattern up by the word he says you round the way you fetch you around you'll be sinned your stomach is so big you

that she's almost around us around so it means is around and as a man saw around us if you are so fed that you're round did you ever hear a fit around man can say Amen can you ever get a 600 pound man or woman that so round fed that can dance you can't even walk from there till there can you see why they did they fattened up by the word now they can't even worship they can't even thank God they can't even thank God for the word they can't even thank God for sending a prophet they can't even thank God for saying Elijah is here they can't even say God for the prophecies that Elijah brought is getting pooped Russia is doing his own thing amen and the world is falling apart they can't even say Amen because they're round they're too fat amen they'll get a heart attack amen their lungs will hit close so they're going to go on sitting in the church threatened up by the word don't come and tell el Tabernacle about the word we want the Dynamics with a word [Applause] and you know what you as much as you want to and then after you eat and you start dancing you exercise you bring your weight down hallelujah amen and that's what we are doing praise God we worshiping God Amen we praising God and in the same time we're eating hallelujah we're eating the word in the same time we do two things in one amen we don't go sit down on our bed amen and our lazy backseat man and can't get up from your seat and come to the front and say amen hallelujah to take the weight down [Applause] give me the next one the token listen here now the token the Dynamics but Israel any Bible student knows that Israel was a type of the church exactly to the promised land and that's where she is turning to to the promised land if Ten Commandments and uh and Mount Sinai and and pull off fire and pull off cloud and uh the rock giving the war to all that is all right but that was just the journey to get to the promised land [Applause] The Ten Commandments was only the journey to get to the promised land now they still in in the journey we have crossed over in 1979 did you hear me we crossed over 1979. [Applause] they saw what justification sanctification justification said we in the baptism of the Holy Ghost as he says underscore [Applause] [Music] but when the evening time comes Wednesday evening time now and the journey was on there was one solemn requirement one after all that after having Moses the Ten Commandments the Smith and Rock Amen the raising of the serpent for healing in the wilderness after all that amen mounts and I after all that the cloud after all that the pull of fire after all that amen there's one requirement after all that after Moses there's one requirement one how many requirements no matter how much Jew he had been regardless of how he says I'm the bride I mean yeah brother says there's brides and brides and he bride regardless if you're a Jew how well you had kept his crops how well he had taken care of the neighbors how much he had done how good a member he was good Amendment Church I stick with brother back as you know and also go to hell with brother Beckett without the Holy Ghost God has no friends when it comes to the Token he even wanted to kill brother brainer took his wife took his shoulder and all that and who's Brother Beckett and brother Branham just sympathized with a Baptist Doctrine not preaching the weapon of the back of preaching hot what a chance does he spend when he dies no chance God can keep me accountable for that I can't see brother Brandon being stroked and really nailed down twice for rejecting the Holy Ghost not rejecting it but compromising with his mother-in-law the other time God straightened him out is when he those Pentecostals came into the church and it started to dance with the tambourine and all that and brother Branham says well you know where I come from I was Baptist I don't believe in this they're making my church a Tavern I'm coming to that and God says what are you sitting in the seat of a scornful Branham [Music] [Applause] he rebuked him twice [Applause] because brother Abraham's first a part of his ministry was baptized against Sensations against uh uh uh uh the the dancing he says I was against it I didn't like it emotions he was against it that was his first part of his ministry he came out with the Baptist idea and all those quotes in the beginning was Baptist but at the end when he asked to be the Elijah of Malachi 4 yet to say Pinnacle starts without a name he had to change [Applause] no matter how much he had done how good a member he was how much titles tithes he paid all these things was fine that was okay he was a good man recognized amongst his people as a good man but just read that so how is brother Becca going to make when brother Brown says without the Holy Ghost Shall Perish oh don't go to the Grave like that brother Becca you're going to have a pleasant surprise this quote is going to nail your height amen set the people free brother Roscoe you're an apostle of God straighten out the thing tell the people I'm in Cape Town and I'm telling you by the quotes [Applause] don't perish with them that is perishing get out from among my people and do not be partakers of their sin that's where the Holy Ghost is it's where the dancing is get away from them that's threatened by the word no how do you know you have got it palm oil locusts Cancun and caterpillar I think it's phase 30. listen what he says there is no place in the Bible where they ever receive the Holy Ghost without having emotions [Music] no place no place and they say we the word the word the word but brother Brahm says no place in the word where anybody ever received the Holy Ghost without emotions [Music] [Applause] so if you receive the Holy Ghost without emotions that means you've got another Holy Ghost but not this one not Malachi Falls Holy Ghost the only place that has this Holy Ghost is here Tabernacle so you're in the right place [Music] you in the right place you in the right place [Applause] [Music] do you believe you're in the right place foreign [Applause] [Music] [Applause] foreign [Applause] [Music] [Applause] not having emotions no place with with brother Becker foreign [Applause] that any of you can show me on tape that they spoke in tongues in Bible Tabernacle or in Georgia's Tabernacle then there is no Holy Ghost there if they didn't receive it like this then they don't have the Holy Ghost now I can tell you brother back had never receive it like this he comes from me unknown and he stopped it in his church he quenched the Holy Ghost it's times that he had the Deacon stand there if you say too much amen they he tells the deacons to tell you to shut up and sit quenching quenching quenching the Holy Ghost but in real Tabernacle quench him in to throw water on the Fire but in El Tabernacle we threw petrol on the Fire and
