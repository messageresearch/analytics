[0:02] Amen.
[0:04] We um
[0:07] want to greet everybody in the name of
[0:08] the Lord Jesus Christ.
[0:11] We have um
[0:13] set this thing out
[0:17] to do this clip
[0:20] and um
[0:22] for tabernacle
[0:25] we have mentioned it
[0:28] as we're going to have these this
[0:31] meeting on the 10th of October Friday
[0:35] night
[0:37] and um we thought that we'll just put
[0:40] out this clip
[0:42] so that um
[0:45] uh our
[0:48] church
[0:49] around South Africa
[0:53] could uh get ready
[0:56] for this meeting.
[0:59] So, um
[1:02] we're just going to have um
[1:06] a little talk
[1:08] around it.
[1:11] to um
[1:13] actually sketch a picture
[1:17] of um
[1:20] this meeting.
[1:22] I'm quite excited
[1:26] um to actually uh preach it
[1:31] and go into it
[1:34] and um I know it is going to be a
[1:39] tremendous blessing
[1:42] to um
[1:45] to uh this part of the bride
[1:48] of Jesus Christ
[1:51] and a person can only do what's in your
[1:53] theophony
[1:55] and uh I believe that this
[1:59] message
[2:01] is certainly something
[2:04] that's been laid in me before the
[2:07] foundation of the world
[2:10] to bring out and preach.
[2:13] So let us go into it.
[2:18] &gt;&gt; Thank you apostle. Thank you for your
[2:20] time. and we let go.
[2:22] &gt;&gt; So agree the church and the saints at
[2:24] large. May God bless you. Um thank you
[2:27] for your time, Apostle.
[2:29] Apostle Mike, first question is that I
[2:33] see you are preaching a lot around
[2:35] Matthew 25. What is the reason?
[2:39] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Well, a good a good question.
[2:44] Um
[2:46] it's uh it's special to me.
[2:51] I preach on it 13
[2:54] years ago
[2:57] and I must mention uh Edgar
[3:01] uh that it didn't go well in the message
[3:04] when I preach it
[3:06] and um
[3:09] I got a little bit of stick
[3:13] for preaching it
[3:15] and um 30 years ago Huh?
[3:21] Because the majority of the message
[3:26] believe it was Pentecost
[3:29] is a foolish virgin.
[3:31] And um
[3:34] but going through it,
[3:37] you know that the spirit of God speaks
[3:39] to preachers.
[3:41] He showed me that it isn't
[3:44] and that the foolish virgin is in the
[3:49] bride and not Pentecost.
[3:53] And
[3:54] because um
[3:57] they went on that brother Brandham
[4:00] seemingly
[4:01] has shown to the Pentecostals, you know,
[4:05] but there's a lot of things that brother
[4:06] Brandham dropped
[4:09] that clearly indicated to me
[4:13] 30, 40 years ago that is in the message
[4:19] and uh
[4:21] in question and answers.
[4:24] He says um
[4:26] the foolish virgin
[4:29] is closer home than what we think.
[4:34] And uh that actually stirred my
[4:36] curiosity
[4:38] that uh Pentecost is not closer home.
[4:43] It's not here near us. We're miles
[4:46] apart.
[4:49] And then
[4:51] I could see that brother Brham
[4:54] was showing
[4:57] where the foolish virgin is going to be.
[5:01] And uh then he says in the 10 virgins
[5:06] she's a virgin.
[5:09] You can only be a virgin through the
[5:12] word.
[5:15] and Pentecost don't have the word
[5:19] so they aren't
[5:22] and will never be
[5:24] a virgin and brother B says both of them
[5:28] are virgins
[5:30] you know and that further showed me that
[5:34] the only virgins you are going to get
[5:38] will be in the message
[5:42] then it says she is so close it will
[5:46] deceive the very elect
[5:49] if it's possible
[5:51] and he makes the sister read the
[5:54] scripture Matthew 24:24
[5:58] so
[5:59] another point
[6:01] that it could not be Pentecost
[6:05] another point
[6:07] that it clearly shows it's in the
[6:10] message
[6:12] so close Pentecost
[6:14] cannot deceive us. Their mouths apart.
[6:18] You know, you just look at a woman and
[6:19] you know they're not close.
[6:22] So that's another point
[6:26] that shows that it is not
[6:29] Pentecost but in the message the foolish
[6:32] virgins is amidst us.
[6:37] She and the wise
[6:40] recognized the same voice
[6:44] Malachi 4 and woke up.
[6:48] Pentecost don't recognize brother
[6:51] Brandham's voice.
[6:53] They're not under that voice.
[6:57] So that is another point
[7:01] that it can't be Pentecost but message.
[7:07] They all press and play. They know the
[7:09] voice of the of the of the of the
[7:12] messenger.
[7:14] And that's another point, a proven
[7:17] point,
[7:18] a solid point to show that it is not
[7:24] Pentecost.
[7:25] They're in the message.
[7:27] right here with us.
[7:29] So um
[7:33] and uh
[7:36] brother Bham says in question and
[7:38] answers if you know
[7:41] what watch that voice came it was not in
[7:45] the first watch it was in the seventh
[7:47] watch go meet the bridegroom.
[7:52] So that voice is a seventh angel's voice
[7:56] which is brother Brham
[7:59] and Pentecost don't recognize that
[8:01] voice.
[8:04] So it is a clear indication
[8:08] that the foolish virgins
[8:10] is amidst the bride.
[8:14] Then um
[8:16] it says that
[8:19] they all woke up
[8:22] to trim their lambs.
[8:25] The wise and the foolish
[8:29] got up and trimmed their lamps. Now the
[8:32] lamb we all know
[8:35] the psalm writer says
[8:39] the word of God is a lamp unto our feet.
[8:43] So the lambs is the word of God.
[8:47] So all of them had the word of God
[8:51] and the word of God in the seventh watch
[8:56] is the message of the hour
[9:00] and they all had the same lamps
[9:04] which they all were under the same
[9:06] ministry
[9:07] of the seventh angel.
[9:11] So um
[9:14] it is another point
[9:17] that makes it
[9:20] more at home
[9:22] than anywhere else.
[9:25] We should not even look at a
[9:27] Pentecostals or anybody else. Those guys
[9:31] are here.
[9:33] Another place brother says the
[9:34] hypocrites.
[9:36] They act as if they are, but they not.
[9:41] They act as if they are bride, but
[9:44] they're not. And that's hypocrisy.
[9:49] That's the reason when you look at them,
[9:53] you can just see it's a facade.
[9:56] It's a put on,
[9:59] you know, and that's another point.
[10:04] And brother Brandham goes on in the 10
[10:06] virgins. He said she preaches the word
[10:12] you know same he said same like
[10:16] the wise virgin.
[10:19] So they had the same word they all they
[10:22] press and played
[10:24] you know and they said the same thing
[10:29] preached the same thing. Brother Brandon
[10:31] says,
[10:32] "So Pentecost don't preach the same
[10:36] message we preach."
[10:40] So again, it's a proven fact
[10:44] that they write here amidst us.
[10:50] And um
[10:53] the prophet says she had everything.
[10:57] The wise
[10:59] virgin had everything.
[11:04] She
[11:06] believe
[11:08] in the blood.
[11:10] She believed in sanctification. Brother
[11:13] Bland says she believe in the atonement.
[11:17] She preached the word.
[11:20] She preached justification.
[11:25] She preached a healing.
[11:27] All the same.
[11:30] And she had a clean life.
[11:33] Brotherson, her life was as clean as a
[11:36] whistle.
[11:38] He says you couldn't put your finger on
[11:40] a life. That means when a guy don't live
[11:43] a life, you can put your finger on him.
[11:47] according to 10 virgins.
[11:49] But with a foolish virgin, you can't you
[11:51] couldn't even do that. She was just as
[11:55] clean
[11:57] as the wise virgin. They had everything
[12:02] the same.
[12:05] But brother Abraham says the only
[12:08] difference between the two
[12:11] was the oil, the quickening power,
[12:16] the good news that the Holy Ghost is
[12:19] here.
[12:21] That was the only difference. All right.
[12:25] &gt;&gt; So now if we look in here
[12:29] and we look at them
[12:31] then
[12:34] or in a message
[12:37] you have to look where
[12:41] the oil is
[12:44] because the oil determines whether she's
[12:46] bride or not bride
[12:50] because she's got the lamp. She's
[12:51] already got the mechanics,
[12:54] but she don't have the dynamics.
[12:57] So, you don't have to worry about the
[12:59] word
[13:01] because she's in the word. But what
[13:05] brother says, I don't care about the
[13:07] word, the mechanics,
[13:09] push and play. I'm worried about the
[13:12] dynamics that must come onto the
[13:14] mechanics.
[13:15] So when you are in a end time church,
[13:21] if you're vigilant,
[13:24] then
[13:26] you will look for a church
[13:30] that has
[13:33] the dynamics and the mechanics. I think
[13:36] in question and answers, he also say
[13:40] uh uh he also says um um he likes a
[13:45] church that's full of the Holy Ghost,
[13:50] you know. So
[13:54] what make them foolish
[13:57] is that they know they don't have it and
[14:01] yet they go on which is foolish. It's
[14:04] like somebody tells you don't smoke,
[14:07] you're going to get cancer and you go on
[14:09] smoking.
[14:14] Is that intelligence?
[14:16] It's not.
[14:19] And uh then what comes to being is what
[14:22] brother Brandham says in Daniel 70
[14:25] weeks. My wife's quote, she used to like
[14:28] it and she always used to tell me,
[14:30] Edgar,
[14:32] this people is willfully
[14:36] blind.
[14:38] You know
[14:40] it's it's not that they are naturally
[14:46] they like what Africans word says as
[14:50] they're going to show you're going to
[14:51] stay in this message under this pastor
[14:55] regardless if he's wrong. So that makes
[14:59] them fools
[15:04] and um
[15:06] because a real Brian member will look at
[15:10] the thing and say this is not right. So,
[15:14] I'm not going to be a fool to follow
[15:17] this thing because this thing ends up
[15:24] in the third dimension of hell.
[15:31] So, foolishness
[15:34] is brought in
[15:37] Matthew 25.
[15:40] And uh what I would like to bring out
[15:43] the Bloom team is
[15:48] they foolish
[15:52] and foolish is to know the truth
[15:57] but you still go for error.
[16:01] You're a fool,
[16:03] you know. So you can look around. I'm
[16:07] sorry to say this and I don't mean to be
[16:10] ugly. How many fools have you got in
[16:13] this message
[16:16] that knows the truth
[16:19] and go against
[16:23] it with everything in you?
[16:28] How could you get u Matthew 25
[16:34] which is prophetic?
[16:37] It is the coming of the Lord.
[16:41] And in that coming the groom tells you
[16:45] what I want from you
[16:49] is oil to come in here. The Holy Ghost I
[16:52] want you to have my spirit.
[16:55] And I could never understand it when we
[16:57] were with brother Coleman those years.
[16:59] We we would like to quote this quote out
[17:03] of question and answers where brother B
[17:05] says the foolish virgin
[17:10] rejected the atonement in its fullness.
[17:14] I could never splice it.
[17:18] I could never ever
[17:20] get my thoughts around it.
[17:24] But now going back into it, I realize
[17:26] that the oil
[17:28] is a seven spirits and seven church
[17:31] ages.
[17:33] It's a baptism of the Holy Ghost.
[17:36] &gt;&gt; Sure.
[17:37] &gt;&gt; So the statue of a perfect man is the
[17:41] full atonement.
[17:44] It's the whole blood. Brother Abraham
[17:47] says the token could only come at the
[17:49] end. Why? Because those seven bloods
[17:52] then came and made the token, the full
[17:54] atonement and they rejected it right at
[17:58] the time
[18:02] of the coming of the broom.
[18:06] Now you want to be bride, you have to be
[18:09] under subjection to the groom.
[18:12] And what the groom wanted
[18:15] was oil to enter in the Holy Ghost.
[18:21] and they rejected it. This message,
[18:26] nobody can come sit in front of me and
[18:28] say they didn't reject it. Nobody.
[18:31] They had many things to say about it.
[18:35] It's hogwash.
[18:37] It's Pentecostalism.
[18:40] It's it's emotions.
[18:44] They just tag everything on it that's
[18:47] ugly. and it became the rejected stone.
[18:51] But I thank God
[18:53] that there was somebody
[18:56] in South Africa that when we go pick up
[18:59] that rejected stone
[19:01] and today they all wanted after fighting
[19:03] all those years today they want it and
[19:07] they don't have it.
[19:09] It's like I told brother Owen Palmer I
[19:11] says Owen just be honest tell me
[19:15] where can I find the Gloria
[19:18] where they preach on it the Holy Ghost
[19:22] but there's no glory
[19:25] nothing there's no atmosphere nothing
[19:31] and yet
[19:33] we want to later on preach on
[19:37] the gospel or what brother mention what
[19:40] the gospel is
[19:42] and where he says that um
[19:46] um
[19:48] the Holy Ghost
[19:54] is the main main thing greater
[19:59] than the word greater than press and
[20:02] play
[20:04] because the Holy Ghost brought press and
[20:06] play the word.
[20:09] So, brother Bam says it's greater than
[20:12] he quotes the scripture of uh speaking
[20:17] against the word, you'll be forgiven.
[20:20] He said, but speaking against the Holy
[20:22] Ghost, no forgiveness. He says that's
[20:26] the greatest.
[20:28] And that's the reason we call this the
[20:31] greatest sermon.
[20:33] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[20:33] &gt;&gt; Because we busy with the greatest thing.
[20:39] And um
[20:42] uh we want to preach later on on um
[20:47] um
[20:49] the working of the Holy Ghost.
[20:52] Not the Holy Ghost. After you have the
[20:54] Holy Ghost, where's the working of the
[20:57] Holy Ghost? Some places
[21:01] they call it
[21:03] the acts.
[21:06] acting, you know, how did you act when
[21:09] you received the Holy Ghost, you know,
[21:12] so we can Holy Ghost, Holy Ghost, Holy
[21:14] Ghost, but
[21:17] you need the working of the Holy Ghost.
[21:20] If you say the Holy Ghost is here, let
[21:23] us see in your church how does it work.
[21:26] You find people say, "Okay, let let us
[21:28] worship God." And the pastor goes there
[21:31] and he blah blah blah, you know, he's
[21:32] the alpha, he's the omega, he's the
[21:34] beginning, he's the end, and blah blah
[21:36] blah blah blah blah blah. And the church
[21:38] also go when he say amen, it stopped.
[21:42] That's not Bible worship.
[21:45] Bible worship you find when the
[21:50] uh tabernacle was dedicated.
[21:54] The Bible says the glory of the Lord
[21:56] came in and the ministers couldn't
[21:59] minister.
[22:02] You know, you can just stand there and
[22:04] the Holy Ghost pours out.
[22:07] That's Bible worship,
[22:12] you know. And uh when the minister's
[22:15] finished blah blah blah blah and the
[22:17] alpha and omega and all that, you know,
[22:19] when he's finished with that, then ship,
[22:22] it's cut off. No feeling, no atmosphere,
[22:28] no pull.
[22:31] And when you take that back to the
[22:32] Bible, you don't find that in the Bible.
[22:37] Find in the Bible emotions. You find in
[22:39] the Bible speaking in tongues. You find
[22:41] in the Bible the working of the Holy
[22:43] Ghost, signs and wonders and miracles.
[22:46] You know, you find in the Bible, you
[22:49] know, the um uh supernatural
[22:53] happens
[22:56] find in the B people drunk and you know
[22:59] a whole deal Gloria
[23:01] and you don't have the Gloria.
[23:05] No way. Dio Gloria means the glory of
[23:09] the Lord.
[23:12] So it that's
[23:15] why
[23:18] I um
[23:24] I'm on this thing
[23:26] because
[23:28] from Revelations 10 the prophecy
[23:34] how could you leave out Matthew 25? Yes,
[23:40] &gt;&gt; cuz Matthew 25 hooks up.
[23:45] I don't know if that answers your
[23:48] question.
[23:49] &gt;&gt; Yes. Yes, Apostle. Thank you. It it
[23:52] actually leads leads into my next
[23:54] question. Um, we we saw when the
[23:57] announcement went out for the services,
[23:59] you've captioned it for us to have a
[24:03] prophetic insight in Matthew 25. Why
[24:07] would you say that? Apostle
[24:12] &gt;&gt; why um
[24:15] if we believe
[24:18] that the seals is prophetic.
[24:20] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[24:22] &gt;&gt; Because that's a prophecy.
[24:25] And um
[24:27] then
[24:30] how could you leave out Matthew 25?
[24:34] Because Matthew 24 is a six seals.
[24:38] Matthew 25 is a main seal, the coming of
[24:41] the Lord. Behold, the bridegroom will
[24:43] cometh.
[24:46] So
[24:49] if I had to preach on Revelations 10
[24:54] and never came back to Matthew 25,
[24:59] then I haven't done justice
[25:03] to
[25:05] Revelations 10.
[25:07] &gt;&gt; And then ask yourself the question, is
[25:09] Revelations 10 prophetic?
[25:14] Why don't anybody preach on it only a
[25:17] prophetic class?
[25:20] So that's the reason when I saw that
[25:23] that it actually slides in
[25:27] to the seals
[25:29] and also when it comes to the twins
[25:34] he'll bring Matthew 24:24 on which is in
[25:38] the six seals.
[25:41] It's close.
[25:45] So
[25:47] that's the reason um
[25:51] I that's one of the reasons I hooked it
[25:55] up because it's the coming of the Lord,
[25:58] the seventh seal.
[26:01] Matthew 25 is the seventh seal.
[26:05] And um the wise virgin Edgar
[26:10] is the book of Revelations 10:2
[26:16] because their names, the wise virgins
[26:18] names is in Revelations 10:2.
[26:25] And that makes it prophetic. That that
[26:28] brings
[26:31] a hallelujah. You know, if we don't if
[26:35] we didn't
[26:37] tie it up over here in the book of
[26:40] Revelations, then we would have had a
[26:42] broken Hallelujah.
[26:47] But so great is this thing here
[26:51] that
[26:55] you can take it and rush it right back
[27:01] to
[27:03] Revelations 10.
[27:06] Her name in the book which is in his
[27:10] right hand.
[27:13] Psalm
[27:15] Revelations 10:1
[27:18] is the bridegroom.
[27:22] Revelations 10:2
[27:24] is is his wife.
[27:29] So how can you go wrong?
[27:33] You know, and
[27:36] she's got his spirit. That's why the
[27:39] prophecy says the spirit and the bride.
[27:42] Brother Bible says
[27:44] &gt;&gt; they were one.
[27:46] Now where did they become one is when
[27:48] she filled up with oil.
[27:54] So it is prophetic
[27:58] and
[28:00] that's why for all these years look the
[28:03] message is nearly around for 100 years
[28:06] but nobody ever
[28:09] touched this.
[28:12] You know, they might mention it, but
[28:19] they haven't got insight.
[28:23] This has to come
[28:25] again in the prophecy.
[28:28] Revelations 10:8,
[28:31] prophesy again. What are we doing? We're
[28:34] prophesying again, but out of Matthew,
[28:39] out of the mouth of the guru.
[28:43] How beautiful is that, you know, to
[28:48] to be able
[28:51] to sit here and look at the whole thing
[28:54] played out.
[28:56] But the scary point is what he says,
[29:02] it's it's so close.
[29:04] They got long dresses. They got long
[29:06] hair. They Brother Brandham around the
[29:08] corner. They push and play. They believe
[29:11] the word. They believe in the atonement.
[29:14] They believe in the crucifixion, brother
[29:16] Brandham says.
[29:18] And they have all that
[29:21] and they just show oil
[29:24] and they miss it.
[29:27] So why go to a church that has all that
[29:31] and you know there's no oil there?
[29:35] That's foolish. That's why the Bible
[29:39] says foolish.
[29:42] You know the truth,
[29:45] but you don't accept the truth.
[29:52] and to him that knows to do good and
[29:57] don't do it to him it's sin. So the
[30:01] insin and sin cannot enter heaven.
[30:06] So
[30:09] yeah, that's why we
[30:13] believe what um
[30:19] what our revelation
[30:22] tells us because it swoops in to the
[30:26] message.
[30:29] And how are they going to hear again
[30:35] if there's not somebody that's coming to
[30:36] preach it again?
[30:39] I mean, they were all shaken up when
[30:41] they quoted Revelations 10:8.
[30:44] &gt;&gt; But how is it does it work? How's it
[30:45] going to be preached again? And some
[30:48] guys ruined and run and say, "Well,
[30:51] that's the bride. You're right."
[30:54] But the whole bride don't preach.
[30:58] There's only a five-fold ministry in the
[31:00] bride that preach.
[31:02] The rest is bride,
[31:05] but they don't prophesy.
[31:07] It takes those five guys to prophesy.
[31:12] And I'm sorry,
[31:14] I have never heard any of them
[31:18] prophesy again.
[31:22] And nailing it down again, whether you
[31:24] like it or not.
[31:27] Brother told me revail and and and and
[31:30] and
[31:32] then uh preach on it said way where way
[31:35] reale didn't even believe in it
[31:41] and up to now he can't answer me he
[31:44] rather got cross
[31:47] so um
[31:49] that's why um it
[31:54] I call it prophetic insight. And I'm
[31:59] making it worse.
[32:02] That's the greatest message
[32:06] that has ever been preached.
[32:10] And I'm going to say it when I preach it
[32:13] that Friday. Why I say this is the
[32:16] greatest message
[32:19] that was ever preached.
[32:22] Show me anything greater.
[32:25] Especially when brother Bram comes
[32:27] around and say the Holy Ghost is
[32:30] everything.
[32:33] And I can take you and show you it is
[32:36] everything.
[32:39] So I think that God really wanted
[32:43] us
[32:46] to come back
[32:49] and speak and preach
[32:53] on this.
[32:55] And I say it again,
[32:58] not only the church is going to
[33:03] appreciate it
[33:05] and like it
[33:08] and
[33:10] lift up their voices and their hands
[33:12] about it, I'm going to feel the same.
[33:17] Cuz as I drew up that message,
[33:23] I
[33:24] drew waters
[33:28] out of the wells
[33:30] of salvation
[33:32] once again,
[33:34] you know.
[33:36] So
[33:38] the criteria,
[33:41] I mean, how could he put a criteria
[33:47] in the seventh seal and he says this is
[33:50] the criteria,
[33:52] not even the word,
[33:55] the Holy Ghost.
[33:59] And that's why we're going to read those
[34:03] quotes, you know, that he says he didn't
[34:06] come to give out the Holy Ghost.
[34:09] So then who
[34:12] had to come behind him and give out the
[34:13] Holy Ghost for
[34:17] 60 years?
[34:20] Everybody knows.
[34:24] So we're going to get into that thing
[34:25] that you know when I look at those
[34:27] things
[34:29] then I really get excited it go not not
[34:33] because it's me but
[34:36] why me
[34:39] if it was not in God's
[34:43] thinking
[34:47] that's why this
[34:49] ministry of ours
[34:51] is completely different
[34:55] and brother couldn't put it better to
[34:58] say there's a oddball ministry
[35:01] cuz nobody preaches like we
[35:04] for 60 years.
[35:08] So
[35:10] therefore I I want to encourage
[35:16] the people
[35:19] to um
[35:22] try and
[35:24] get
[35:26] a visitor and pull him along
[35:32] and
[35:34] also
[35:36] encourage the ones that's going to be on
[35:38] streaming
[35:39] which will be on the storehouse.
[35:43] I will give the details of the
[35:44] storehouse
[35:46] and uh for you to get it.
[35:50] I only have one problem Edgar.
[35:54] I really don't know if I'll be able to
[35:56] finish.
[35:58] It's the only problem I have.
[36:02] If not, we'll have to get another
[36:05] Friday.
[36:08] But I would like to have
[36:12] this message,
[36:15] the greatest of them all,
[36:19] to be on tape
[36:23] from the A till the Z.
[36:28] I think I was spared
[36:32] &gt;&gt; to get to this point.
[36:37] I feel so good
[36:41] that
[36:44] Revelations 10
[36:47] is still moving on the prophecy. It's
[36:51] how long now?
[36:56] And also, Edgar, what I want to say is
[37:00] um
[37:02] why Matthew 25?
[37:04] Because Matthew 25 is the seventh seal
[37:08] and brother Bram says the anointing is
[37:11] on the seventh seal. Now there again I
[37:14] couldn't understand it way back there.
[37:18] I understand it now because I like to
[37:22] nail it back into the Bible.
[37:25] &gt;&gt; And I couldn't understand why he said
[37:28] so. But now I can because in the seventh
[37:31] seal you need the oil the anointing.
[37:34] So where is the anointing?
[37:39] &gt;&gt; On the seventh seal.
[37:42] He said I went west and came back with
[37:44] the Holy Ghost to bring down the Holy
[37:47] Ghost. The oil the seventh seal.
[37:51] The anointing is on the seventh seal.
[37:57] So
[37:59] I hope that
[38:02] that answers
[38:04] your question.
[38:06] &gt;&gt; Yes, surely does
[38:10] mentioning the seven seal apostle.
[38:14] What made you tie it into Revelation? I
[38:18] know you said it's the keystone
[38:19] Revelation. What made you tie Matthew 25
[38:23] into it?
[38:24] Well,
[38:26] I must be honest. Well, I I I I didn't
[38:29] tie it in.
[38:32] Uh, Brother Brandham tied it in.
[38:37] I only was anointed to pick it up
[38:43] and tie it in like brother Brandham tied
[38:46] it in.
[38:48] And that's why when he said
[38:52] the kingdom of God is likened unto 10
[38:55] virgins,
[38:59] 10 had oil, 10, five had oil, five
[39:02] didn't have oil,
[39:05] and they went a cry out at midnight,
[39:10] go and meet the bridegroom. And he says
[39:13] that was the coming of the Lord.
[39:16] And I said, "Wow."
[39:18] Then I went and read the sixth seal. In
[39:21] the sixth seal, he brings up Matthew 24
[39:24] right down and he skips Matthew 25.
[39:28] And then I check in the Bible
[39:32] the six seals
[39:34] one after the other
[39:39] till Revelation 6.
[39:42] It stopped at a six seal. Revelation 6.
[39:46] Revelation 74
[39:49] 144.
[39:50] Then after he skipped that, then he
[39:53] borrowed the seven seals in Revelations
[39:55] 10:8. Is exactly like Matthew 24. He
[40:00] stopped.
[40:01] Then he go to Matthew 25 and he brings
[40:04] out the seventh seal.
[40:07] So I didn't tie it up. I was given
[40:14] eyes and a revelation
[40:17] to see it while nobody else saw it,
[40:22] you know. So, um
[40:26] the six seals
[40:30] he explained
[40:31] and the seventh seal
[40:35] is where the oil is and there's where
[40:38] the anointing is. None of the other
[40:41] seals
[40:43] did you
[40:46] have to have
[40:50] the oil to go in.
[40:55] You were told in the sixth seal
[40:59] with a black horse rider
[41:02] at night
[41:04] oil and the wine it was still there.
[41:09] But that didn't happen there
[41:13] in the third seal. It happened in the
[41:16] seventh seal when they rejected it.
[41:22] Then he says, "Bang, you rejected the
[41:25] oil.
[41:27] I know you're not."
[41:30] Now
[41:33] they preach it a lot of times and it
[41:36] does make sense.
[41:38] What do you mean there I know it not? Is
[41:41] like when a man knows his wife,
[41:46] she receive his seed.
[41:48] But here
[41:50] he knew her not.
[41:53] She had the can and the word but she
[41:57] didn't receive it inside of her.
[42:02] So he says, "I don't even know you.
[42:07] Can you imagine all the years you
[42:10] prophet prophet prophet
[42:13] and in the end he says I don't know you.
[42:18] He rejected the most important thing and
[42:23] I want to say it. I'm going have to say
[42:25] it when I die and stand in front of God.
[42:30] that you have rejected it in the
[42:33] message. You rejected it. You rejected
[42:37] the working of the Holy Ghost is because
[42:40] you didn't have the Holy Ghost. Now,
[42:42] everybody wants it,
[42:45] but there's no deal, Gloria.
[42:50] It's a sad sad sad case.
[42:55] How many pastors did we have that came
[42:58] to our church and says they would like
[43:02] to have what we have? But the time is
[43:06] up.
[43:10] The time is up.
[43:13] There's a time for everything.
[43:17] There was a time that you could get the
[43:18] Holy Ghost,
[43:22] but there's a time it's cut off. Now,
[43:24] why do you say so? Because
[43:29] Jesus told us, I think Matthew 17, as it
[43:32] was in the days of Noah.
[43:35] Now, what happened in the days of Noah?
[43:37] Genesis 6, he says, "My spirit,
[43:40] &gt;&gt; yes,
[43:41] &gt;&gt; shall not always strive with men. My
[43:44] spirit will be taken away."
[43:48] And we know with Simpson and all this
[43:51] and Kabot and all that the spirit was
[43:53] taken away and here we are the spirit is
[43:56] taken away
[43:59] and it's hard saw and I want to say tell
[44:03] the brothers and I mean I tell them I
[44:06] don't know if you will be able to get
[44:07] it. They ask me to pray for them. I
[44:09] said, "I don't know if you're going to
[44:11] get it and be able to take it to your
[44:12] church
[44:16] &gt;&gt; because my concern is
[44:20] you uh
[44:23] you have
[44:26] Revelation 6, Black Rider. There's just
[44:29] a little bit left.
[44:32] That means it dried up until a little
[44:34] bit
[44:36] in the
[44:38] third seal.
[44:41] But when you come to the seventh seal,
[44:42] Matthew 25,
[44:45] there's no oil.
[44:48] The seventh seal, no oil.
[44:53] And that's all that I'm trying to tell
[44:55] them and show them.
[44:59] I said if you can show me where I can
[45:01] get the gloria
[45:04] you know
[45:06] and Jesus makes it so simple for us all.
[45:10] He says by their fruit you will know
[45:12] them. Very simple. If a man says he's
[45:16] evangelist check his fruit.
[45:21] If a man says he's a prophet check his
[45:24] fruit.
[45:26] Is that fruit?
[45:28] He says he is an apostle. Let him show
[45:30] you his fruit of an apostle.
[45:35] It's very simple. The man says the Holy
[45:39] Ghost is gone.
[45:42] And he says, "You show me where I can
[45:45] find it."
[45:47] And you can't find it.
[45:52] Then that guy is right. He's not
[45:55] blobbing.
[45:58] and saying things
[46:01] that is not true. Everybody knows is the
[46:03] truth that the Holy Ghost is gone. A
[46:07] thing that I want to bring in here,
[46:10] people think if they jump and shout and
[46:12] all that that's the Holy Ghost. That's
[46:14] not the Holy Ghost.
[46:17] That's what the Holy Ghost does.
[46:22] It will make you jump and shout and all
[46:24] that.
[46:26] But if you have the Holy Ghost in your
[46:28] church, even somebody outside like how
[46:32] many times it happened just this year,
[46:34] people outside, not of El Tabernacle,
[46:36] Pentecostals and everybody came in and
[46:38] says you can feel the Holy Ghost there.
[46:43] There's an atmosphere.
[46:46] But they preach on the Holy Ghost. No
[46:48] atmosphere, no feeling, no emotions,
[46:53] nothing.
[46:55] So it is only a talk and not a walk.
[47:01] I don't listen to the talk. Just go a
[47:04] token and a token and a to fine
[47:08] but let me see the working of the token.
[47:12] Let me come and hear you preach.
[47:13] Remember that the quote that brother
[47:16] says, you know, uh, let me ask you to
[47:19] come up here and, uh, let the Holy Ghost
[47:22] flow after you preach. You know that
[47:25] quote. And nobody came up.
[47:30] And we have the same thing. But guys
[47:32] speak about the Holy Ghost. Let him come
[47:34] up
[47:36] and preach and show us the dear Gloria.
[47:39] If you can't, you're a deceiver. You're
[47:42] only there to steal tithes.
[47:45] That's all that you care for. And you
[47:48] know you don't have it.
[47:51] That makes it so bad. And that's the
[47:55] reason Jesus
[47:58] emphatically
[48:00] put it down as foolish
[48:06] just because you like the guy's smile.
[48:12] you go with him.
[48:14] You know, I don't care if it's my
[48:17] father.
[48:19] If he don't have the works of his faith,
[48:24] I'm sorry.
[48:30] I hope that is
[48:34] what you asked for.
[48:38] That
[48:42] why we knitted it in to revelations
[48:49] and um
[48:52] brothers is saying they believe
[48:54] everything the lamb that stepped forward
[48:56] and blood and all they believe all that
[49:00] but they just don't have the oil
[49:05] condition.
[49:06] &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's the condition.
[49:14] Okay.
[49:15] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Apostle. Surely we can agree
[49:18] with what you always quote the scripture
[49:21] where you say you've dug deep and drank
[49:25] strange waters. Once again,
[49:28] that scripture is made manifest.
[49:31] I think um for me it makes it a
[49:36] prophetic message. Surely makes it a
[49:38] prophetic message apostle.
[49:40] &gt;&gt; Yeah, it does.
[49:43] It does. And and the beauty part, Edgar,
[49:46] is not that
[49:49] we feel like that.
[49:52] The fact is it is like that.
[49:56] You cannot have the seventh seal and
[49:58] it's not prophetic.
[50:02] That's why they make such a bigger
[50:03] mistake. They say the seventh seal is
[50:07] silence.
[50:08] Brother Bam says is silence in heaven
[50:10] but activity on the earth. What
[50:12] activity? 10 virgins.
[50:15] Look at that activity. And you'll hear
[50:18] Friday
[50:20] the activity
[50:23] that has gone on by supernatural
[50:27] insight.
[50:29] What has gone on there in Matthew 25?
[50:33] the activity that went on there
[50:38] that it really blows your mind
[50:43] when you just read it. My brother B says
[50:46] we in a prophetic class. That's why we
[50:49] can't say this is prophetic, you know.
[50:53] and seeing it with a prophetic eye, you
[50:56] can look between the lines and realize
[50:58] what has gone on here,
[51:00] which is what we want to bring out.
[51:04] Um,
[51:06] on the 10th,
[51:07] Friday,
[51:09] October,
[51:12] what's written in between the lines
[51:17] to everybody else,
[51:20] it looked like crooked lines.
[51:23] But God likes to write
[51:26] straight on crooked lines.
[51:30] So
[51:33] I hope I answered the question.
[51:36] &gt;&gt; No, thank you Apostle. Um that concludes
[51:38] my questions. I thank you.
[51:40] &gt;&gt; Okay. Yeah. And then um
[51:44] I just want to say again
[51:48] I feel really excited.
[51:52] I mean we have a lot of meetings that we
[51:54] are going to handle until November,
[52:00] but I feel that um
[52:04] this one uh this Friday
[52:08] is going to be
[52:12] one of my
[52:16] pet
[52:20] seminates.
[52:23] And that's the reason I believe
[52:27] it is the greatest
[52:30] message
[52:32] that was ever preached
[52:37] in the end time message.
[52:42] So
[52:44] pray for the meeting
[52:48] and um
[52:52] look into what I tried to tell you
[52:59] about the oil
[53:03] and by prophetic
[53:05] insight you'll see
[53:07] that the oil is the Holy Ghost which is
[53:10] the dynamic dynamics and the dynamics
[53:13] change your body for the rapture and
[53:16] they went in. How did they go in?
[53:21] The oil changed their bodies but the
[53:23] foolish virgins bodies wasn't changed.
[53:26] And that's why brother Bam says what
[53:29] happens to them
[53:32] for the thousand years. He says they are
[53:34] in the grave.
[53:38] But because of the oil, our bodies is
[53:40] changed. If the spirit that raised Jesus
[53:45] from the dead
[53:47] lives in you, it will change quicken
[53:52] your mortal bodies and then you can go
[53:55] in cuz flesh and blood doesn't go in.
[53:59] They will really change when the foolish
[54:02] virgins went to go look for oil.
[54:05] Can you see how prophetic this thing is?
[54:09] &gt;&gt; So may God bless you. I dropped a lot of
[54:12] the little things that uh but uh this is
[54:17] worth dropping again
[54:19] in any sermon.
[54:22] Thank you, Edgar. I hope I answered your
[54:24] questions and
[54:26] I hope uh I answered a lot of other
[54:30] questions.
[54:32] Amen.
