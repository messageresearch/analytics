[0:01] [Music]
[0:08] good
[0:09] evening out
[0:12] Tabernacle we um greet
[0:16] you
[0:17] um in the name of uh our precious King
[0:23] and
[0:24] savior the beautiful
[0:27] lovable adorable
[0:30] Lord Jesus
[0:33] Christ to know him his life
[0:37] eternal and uh we
[0:41] are only here
[0:44] to uphold
[0:46] him to please
[0:49] him and to do whatever he unction eyes
[0:54] us to
[0:57] do and um
[1:01] I greet you in his name the Lord Jesus
[1:05] Christ I um have uh taken it on
[1:11] myself to make this
[1:14] clip and
[1:16] um it is especially for Al
[1:21] Tabernacle
[1:23] I was telling the brothers I'm a concern
[1:32] Elder of el
[1:36] Tabernacle
[1:40] tonight this
[1:42] time or the
[1:45] season
[1:47] um and I feel there's a lot of people
[1:51] around that uh is uh totally not
[1:57] concerned on
[2:00] what's taking
[2:02] place in so much so that
[2:06] um we
[2:09] um we're supposed to be in a desperate
[2:14] mode and
[2:16] um I am worried because brother Brams is
[2:20] a lack of
[2:21] desperation is a lack of love and love
[2:25] is the Holy Ghost the angel told brother
[2:28] brandham so it's the lack of the Holy
[2:31] Ghost that's why we're
[2:33] not so
[2:36] desperate and as I said the other day I
[2:39] just felt
[2:41] that a
[2:43] chunk has moved over again towards
[2:48] Israel of the Holy
[2:51] Ghost and the more it
[2:53] leaves the less desperate we will
[2:57] become so we want to
[3:01] try and install it in
[3:05] you
[3:08] to be
[3:12] vigilant
[3:16] observant on what's going on around
[3:19] you
[3:21] so I took it on myself when
[3:25] I was in study on
[3:28] Saturday and and uh check a few things
[3:32] up and it just I was
[3:36] astonished I was
[3:39] really taken back to
[3:44] realize what is really
[3:49] happening in the
[3:51] world
[3:54] today it's one
[3:58] place is FL
[4:01] other
[4:02] place
[4:04] drought other
[4:07] place blot of places
[4:11] Wars and
[4:14] uh
[4:16] famine
[4:18] hunger people complaining about the
[4:21] economy money is drying
[4:24] up and uh it is all being SP spoken of
[4:31] for so many
[4:33] years and now it
[4:36] is it has caught up with us so we'd like
[4:40] to speak on
[4:43] something uh next week
[4:46] Thursday
[4:48] um
[4:50] on Gog and
[4:53] MOG what
[4:58] um what is that
[5:00] happening we used to put it so far in
[5:03] the
[5:04] future we used to speak it about it as
[5:09] if it's so
[5:12] distant but today we cannot do
[5:16] that because that
[5:19] is the thing that has rattled us
[5:24] supposed to have rattled us if we had to
[5:28] realize
[5:30] is what it
[5:34] entails so I need to tell the
[5:38] church what is happening and in closing
[5:42] I would like to say
[5:44] this what motivated me too is I told you
[5:49] that
[5:50] um about
[5:53] Co the plague is
[5:56] here and then I said now what's going to
[5:59] happen after the
[6:00] plague I said it's going to be climate
[6:05] change and now we have climate change
[6:07] all
[6:09] over and then
[6:12] I look at it right after climate
[6:18] change they were saying that they're
[6:20] going to
[6:22] stop um
[6:25] pumping fossil fuel
[6:30] and try and bring it
[6:32] down but
[6:34] n Gog and may go is
[6:37] struck America's pumping more Saudi
[6:41] Arabia is pumping
[6:43] more more fossil fuel is getting
[6:47] used and they clearly forgot
[6:53] about the
[6:55] atmospheric conditions which they laay
[6:58] down just like last year in
[7:02] October and
[7:04] um that is becoming worse and
[7:08] worse and then after that we had
[7:16] Russia getting up from
[7:19] her deep sleep for all these
[7:24] years and she's on the war
[7:28] path and that is something i' would like
[7:31] to just talk to the church if I can get
[7:34] it right to
[7:35] talk and
[7:39] show how close we
[7:41] are at the coming and it comes at the
[7:46] back of what we spoke on the
[7:50] Jubilee the 70th
[7:54] Jubilee when we expect it to happen two
[7:57] to four years
[8:00] in the making and soon after we preached
[8:05] that we had what we've got
[8:10] now after Co we have the Jubilee after
[8:15] Jubilee we have climate change after
[8:18] climate change we
[8:22] have the be
[8:26] walking ever ever bold
[8:31] so we would like to talk on
[8:33] that to see if we can help you just to
[8:36] wake up a little
[8:39] bit and the best thing to become now is
[8:45] to become
[8:47] spiritual
[8:49] so I took it on myself that we are going
[8:53] to have the Tuesday fasting for yourself
[9:00] Wednesday short prayer meeting we're
[9:02] just going to sing a song and then pray
[9:05] and then dismiss for the
[9:08] Thursday and uh the
[9:10] Thursday uh I like to speak to the
[9:13] viewers
[9:14] on a concerned past of e
[9:18] Tabernacle to an
[9:22] unconcerned people in the
[9:25] message so may God bless you and may you
[9:28] pray for us
[9:30] that God should help
[9:32] us uh and strengthen
[9:35] us to try and do whatever we want to do
[9:38] because the Saturday we're going to
[9:39] preach again thank you may God bless you
