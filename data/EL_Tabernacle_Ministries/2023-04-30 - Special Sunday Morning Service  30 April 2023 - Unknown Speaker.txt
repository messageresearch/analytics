my God hey man foreign [Applause] I'm so glad in my soul that I'm not Ahmed some Baptist [Applause] [Applause] s the Pentecostal experience under [Applause] that's why the people that has the Pentecostal experience gets such a lot out of a service [Applause] there is no time to sleep because the Holy Spirit is not gonna make you sleep [Music] [Applause] [Applause] they told Brother Branham how can you preach with all that noise and brother Brandon my answer them and said that's why I'm preaching [Music] [Applause] [Applause] I I've come down again too but every girl or husband and Jonathan as you feel the library dances yeah [Applause] we creature in the name of Jesus king God [Applause] [Applause] will ask him to bless you and we won't so I don't know I'm happy to be here [Applause] we came from bloemfontein and meeting them on Wednesday came down again to have this meeting and just greet you people [Applause] [Applause] are going up to George from yeah after the meeting I'm not gonna rush back home for the meeting next week [Applause] I have a busy schedule I like to be busy anyhow and try to look for that last soul [Applause] and I hope you are also looking for him [Applause] it could even be your friend that you walk with maybe every day to work it could even be a colic at work could be the neighbor it says you look for them [Applause] what else [Applause] let us look to make the time shorter now I don't know I still have a question mark with a you still got to be saved or whether he's gonna get the baptism of the Holy Ghost to be in because the baptism of the Holy Ghost put you in the church and when you come in from outside you only get converted so either way we sick and tired of this old world [Applause] song that's why we have been preaching in 40 countries and we didn't ask any of that 40 countries if we can come and visit them they send me invitation I don't go out to any country [Applause] unless they give me invitation [Applause] so I know there's some brethren as they travel they write and they ask if they could come and preach to their congregations around the world but I haven't asked any ever if I could come and visit their Church I was given invitations to the 40 countries and that's not the only countries that I visited I visited Taiwan Greece China of Africa with Zambia malao in Swaziland I visited Rome Italy Portugal and Malaysia and Singapore Argentina Wales Egypt Jordan and on and on and on it goes [Applause] [Applause] and right now it's been streamed right across South Africa this Gathering yeah [Applause] [Music] [Applause] and by tomorrow it will be worldwide we do not ask them to come onto our stream but people knows where they can get something [Applause] [Applause] and so there's a lot of people a lot of ministers at streams but the people know they're not going to get anything so they don't listen to them they get sick so eight to ten or 20 people listening to their messages because there's no meat on the bone [Applause] and people you cannot fool them all the time [Applause] they're going to find out you look at animal life you'll find animals only there where they can get food the minute they don't get food they travel to another place [Applause] they might they might not like the place but because of the food that's there they might not like El Tabernacle but they like the food that's in our government so therefore we put the food on the table before them and you find them eating [Applause] another Pastor told me the other some time ago told me Brothers go all the two don't have to do please don't stop preaching because we're going to die [Applause] so foreign something you sound and it's selling Maybe you sound some things that the people want and they buy it why must you go and sell something that the people that don't want and leave the thing that you are selling that is actually bringing in something you'd rather leave the other thing and you go on to the thing that works [Applause] [Applause] so we are not gonna give this up for anything amen so may God bless you and uh you pray for me I pray for you [Applause] and remember we didn't come to church today we come here today to speak to something that will speak back to us [Applause] yeah [Applause] you're not going out here with an unanswered question May all your questions the answer is my prayer [Applause] so I think you know already what I'm gonna preach on because I streamed it and I am going to preach on it because I am the elders member in the message now in South Africa or in Africa in the whole of Africa and uh I am the only one that brother Branham laid the hands on [Applause] so so I should know what I'm talking about I I didn't come here to waste your time and waste my time because there is no time [Applause] [Music] [Applause] we have to make sure that everything is in place for us to make it to the gate positively and I don't want to miss it amen therefore let's go to the word of God and let us put down what God wants us to have for this day because he says give us this day Our Daily Bread so may he help us to give you this day your daily bread I like to take two scriptures in Ecclesiastes three one three eight First Corinthians 3 6. and Zechariah 4 6. turning to Ecclesiastes chapter 3. verse 1. and then Ecclesiastes three verse 8. to everything there is a season and a Time to every purpose under the heaven everything has a Time and has a season for every purpose that God sinned on the Earth therefore it's essential to know what time you are living in and what season you are experiencing in the message of the hour we cannot just go on and says I am in the message and you do not know your time in the message and your season in the message because everything has a Time and a season then verse 8 it says A Time To Love and as I said when we spoke on George Martin's thing brother George Martin Pastor George Martin sing I said you can't love all the time and that made me sick in this message wherever you go you hear love love love nice humble love and it's wrong because there's only a Time and a season too long I want to come back there then it says A Time To Love and a time to you can't hate all the time you become an outlaw when you hate all the time but now you can't hate in the time of love That season you need to love and then you can't Love in the Time of hate and judgment Sodom couldn't get love because it was a time of judgment you must have your balance I'd like to take another scripture um as I said Corinthians 3 verse 6. 13 6 I'm sorry 13 6. it says that love rejoices not in iniquity love rejoice in the truth now how could you say you have love and there's no rejoicing in your church then you're a liar because love rejoice you can't have rejoicing Without Love then why isn't there rejoicing in the church because automatically there's no love then why is there such a lot of rejoicing in El Tabernacle now I'm asking you [Applause] because we put a thing the way God wants it have you got it did I speak to somebody right over the air in South Africa where they're listening to me have you got it Johannesburg all those places so no rejoicing No Love and then made it worse rejoice in the truth the truth is the word so they don't have the true word in its season and in its time [Applause] another scripture foreign chapter 4 verse 6. then it answered and spoke unto me saying this is the word of the Lord unto Jehovah Bell I like to put brother branham's name in there saying to brother Brennan it's not by might nor by power but [Music] father we thank you for the reading of your word you said that your word won't turn unto your Void but it will accomplish what it should and I'll pray that you would open it up punctuated anointed throw water on it Let It Grow and never stop growing Lord as we add add the seven birth pings of Malachi 4. I hand a meeting into your hands in Jesus name amen you may be suitable um uh time to love A Time To Love there's only a space of time to love and there's a time space to hate that's why brother Branham says we must be like Jesus Christ we mustn't get too soft that we don't clean out the church he says Jesus Christ went into the church with a whoop and he says he cleaned the church out [Music] now that was not the time to laugh that was not the time to be nice my brother that was not the time to be meek my brother that was not the time that we think that love had to cover the multitude of the Sun in the church that was a time of height because the prophet says he looked at them with hatred malice he was crossed when he looked at him and brother when it says where's your virtues now if you don't hear the balance you would says now how could this be love that was perfect Lord [Applause] that was perfect love when he cleaned out the church and hit on the cross when there was a sin on his right left hand side and guys gambling here at the foot of his is his his cross he looked down on them and he says I forgive you A Time To Love [Applause] so there's a Time To Love and there's a time to hate the Bible says he loves The Sinner that's why he says they know not what they do it was a time that it showed love but in the temple there was no time for love Sodom and Gomorrah there was no time to lie so so he says I hated Esau there was no time to allow [Applause] so I came to the conclusion What is love everybody speaks about love wherever you go love they think that when you rebuke people you don't have love when you tell them where they are wrong they say you have no love [Applause] and then the one that compromises with a guy that is wrong that guy's got love it's got love you know no he's got compromise he's compromising [Applause] give me the man that come up and said brother Roscoe you're wrong then I show you a man that loves me and he shows me in the Bible and he shows me in the spoken word then I would say yes that's a lot [Applause] when you straighten out somebody then they say Mr No Love and yet that's love so what is love What is love is allowed to compromise with your brother if he can't dance and he doesn't want to dance and he'll reject to dance and the Bible says You must dance and you tell him the Bible says so and he doesn't want to listen you are the one that has love but he hasn't got it because God's love is correct [Applause] that's why an El Tabernacle when you're wrong you're wrong [Music] [Applause] What is love I sat in a church in Kimberly in another guy got up and say yeah you must love and I knew it was for me and I look at him I look at this young man and I said this young man don't even know what love is but they speak about love What is love do they know what is love now what a queer title and subject this is What is love and I got it straight from Brother Brennan brother Brandon rejected King I think 1916. I think that's after he preach all the love messages and then after that he preached on the rejected King and the angel of the Lord came to him and he thought this is my chance this is my opportunity this is my time This Is My Season to ask the angel of the Lord and this is what he asked the angel of the Lord angel of God What is love brother praying didn't even know what love is I Didn't Know What Love Is a seventh messenger Didn't Know What Love Is and I'm asking the same question What is love and the angel of the Lord says William Branham you've been preaching it all the time he says but what he says the baptism of the Holy Ghost [Applause] Hallelujah [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] he says the baptism of the Holy Ghost is love now who has love I've got news for you El Tabernacle El Tabernacle [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] so what happened here president Didn't Know What Love Is that came out of the heart of the angel Into the Heart of the prophet then made known through the heart of an apostle this morning this morning this morning [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] so I know what love is but they never knew it because nobody ever preached it this is the first time somebody preaching that the baptism of the Holy Ghost Islam what is the baptism of the Holy Ghost drunk in the spirit what's the baptism of the Holy Ghost president shouting and jumping and screaming what's the battle of the Holy Ghost emotions Say Amen [Applause] [Music] [Applause] oh [Applause] [Applause] you know what they destroyed the library before reading the book they destroy the storehouse before they heard my message and now they're in darkness and our brother Branham tells you you don't have love until it is the Holy Ghost [Music] so you don't listen to them when they speak on love if they don't bring it from the Holy Ghost it's not God's love we want God's love we want God's love we want God's love we want God's love [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] I listen to them as they preach on love and speak about love and love amen and I think in myself they don't even know what they're talking about [Applause] they mix love up with a fruit of love because I'm gonna jump the gun now Galatians tells you that the Fruit of the Spirit is love so love comes out of the baptism of the Holy Ghost it's only a fruit [Applause] of the Holy Ghost and they say that is love that's not love the baptism of the Holy Ghost is love my brother it's love my sister it's love my sinner friend get the baptism of the Holy Ghost and he will lead you into love [Music] [Applause] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] oh the either makes up love with the fruit of the spirit weakness and temperance godliness amen and niceness beautifulness and all that that's all fruit that's not love is the holy ghost that produce those things [Applause] do you understand [Applause] hermanus do you understand [Applause] [Music] so you never believe fables amen that's why you and El Tabernacle [Applause] and that's why you rejoice saying because the word of God has been preached [Applause] [Music] aren't you happy New Year [Applause] [Music] foreign [Music] [Applause] [Applause] then they mix up love with fully Your Love for your love is not love there's only one love can you tell me which love [Applause] they brought us a belief loveman if you love a girl man are you going to be sad [Applause] [Music] [Applause] and if you love God [Applause] they mix up love the world makes up love everybody makes up love they think to give things to the poor and all that that's love that's not love there's only one love and it's God's love and God's love is a rebuking love because it's resumed it rejoices in the truth and the truth shall set you free [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] they mix up love amen they have a compromising love the guy the guy sleeps with every woman he gets and they still have him in the church paying tithes I give his tights back and says get out if I love him I'm going to correct him [Applause] amen [Applause] they believe in a in a compromising love the world believe in a compromising love why love hanging on a chain around their necks is in love but a perverted love and they feel religious would love hanging around the Nets on a chain love as a sticker on the bumper of a car is in love but perverted cloth and they feel secure because they've got love on the bumper of a car that nobody will steal that car that's not love they have love on a Signet of a ring amen that isn't love amen because tomorrow you can take that ring off and throw it away and say you have love that's not love they marry today tomorrow they divorce and the ring is gone that's not love and they feel they secure and they feel they're religious love displayed on a billboard of a building that's not love and they feel that they have salvation because love the word love is there I like brother Layman used to say he says don't come and tell me about love he says he's a loved one love on the postcard and a letter wrote to a woman or a man that's not love it's only a Feeling [Applause] then what is love it's not a Signet love on a ring it's not hanging around a neck it's not on a bumper sticker it's not the Love on a billboard or then what is love tell me church tell me I can't hear you I don't hear you that's too soft yes that is love according to Malachi 4 and according to the angel which is Jesus Christ [Applause] oh the baptism of the Holy Ghost is Alice it's everything [Applause] [Music] why must I settle for less when God gave me the Revelation like another Prophet told me he says you took the best out of the message I said what's that he says the baptism of the Holy Ghost I took the best and I've got the best because the baptism of the Holy Ghost as ours [Applause] foreign [Applause] the baptism of the Holy Ghost is even the blood because the token is the Holy Ghost even the blog the blood that cleans you that's even the Holy Ghost that's even the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the Holy Ghost baptism is greater than the word brother Brennan said [Applause] [Music] so the baptism of the Holy Ghost sees everything [Applause] [Music] Church I'll come and creep and sit in the back there for what my ears year and what my heart fails I peel it in my hands I peel it in my feet I put it way over me the love of God the baptism of the Holy Ghost [Applause] thank you [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] now listen to this they do not know what love is you know why because many love power they love power but I have no power to love they love power but they don't have power to love why because you can only get power after the Holy Ghost has come upon you then you have power to love Hallelujah blessed be my conscious man can preach man Hallelujah [Music] [Applause] I want you to say it with me many love power but they have no power to love what happened when I answered George Martin of Pastor George Martin I said there's no love they speak about love but they don't have power to enforce law they don't have power to send my brother I forgive you but El Tabernacle the power is here for you to love your brother to love your sister to love your enemy power [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Applause] oh my they all speak about the blood [Music] but they never broke the blood but ultimate broke the blood vessel what came out of that what came out of that I want to hear from you what did come out of the blood vessel so that means you're under the blood [Applause] [Music] oh my God Jonathan in the Bible his father wanted him to portray David Jonathan in the Bible was actually hated by his father because of what because of the love he had for David [Applause] and you know what the Bible says the love between the two of them was greater than the love of a woman it was greater than polio love so what love was between Jonathan and David if it was greater [Music] [Applause] then what is the love in El Tabernacle [Music] a holy ghost love the real alarm [Applause] [Music] the baptism of the Holy Ghost alive [Applause] now listen to this preaching my God this guy can preach man listen to this preaching Amen brother Brahm says the guide which is the baptism of the Holy Ghost takes the Believer by the hand in a guide and he leads him into faith and virtue and knowledge and Temperance and patience and godliness he leads you into his own virtues he leads you into his own fruit amen the Holy Ghost [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] and what I like and what I love after he led you right up then he says he lead you into the Holy Ghost then brother man put the Holy Ghost there and the next step is love and Galatians is the the fruit of the Holy Ghost is so the Holy Ghost gives you the Capstone that was for somebody somewhere [Music] [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] there is only one love and that's a couple of all the other loves is a perversion it gets weaker and weaker everything that's not the Holy Ghost is not perfect because when that which is perfect has come that's which is in part will be done away with because the quickening power the Holy Ghost will change this Mortal body [Music] keeping the baptism of the Holy Ghost [Music] [Applause] let me just eat this quickly a couple of his first John 4 16. God is a love and God is a spirit so the spirit has the fruits and all the fruits have the spirit fully Your Love is love for a woman Ephesians 5 28. its husbands love your wives a weaker love now it's not love God is love your wife it's a weaker love the third one as it comes down the ladder Heroes of love Evil's love is a sexual love goes into sex Hebrew 13 4 the bed is undefiled a week of love then it gets weaker it goes to stoic love stoic love is love for another man's wife Exodus 20. Thou shalt not come until thou tree [Applause] then it gets weaker it goes into free love free love free love amen Genesis 6 they took them to themselves wives they didn't marry them free love then it gets weaker it gets into lust full love Matthew 5 28 who sayever look upon a woman and lust after her has commanded adultery with her already lustful love [Applause] listen I can't help for what God gave me I can't help for what a preacher I am I can't help from a gift God gave me I came from the conference of God and I don't read the spoken word like all the other ministers God leads me different [Applause] [Music] then it comes to the loss Brother Bruno says then he comes to the last ungodly love which is Romans 1 24 homosexual love Solomon Gomorrah then God comes into the flesh it's a homosexual love then he comes down himself to come and see if it is soul Amen in homosexual love when it hits homosexual love it leads the the color violet it comes into the color violet and God become a man [Applause] [Applause] when you get here it's so far away from a couple so far away from the spirit of God that it's not resembling God anymore but is resembling the Lucifer then it goes further amen into a a a a furtherance from the agape love it goes into incest father sleeping with their daughters it breaks down it becomes worse and worse and worse and worse are we there [Applause] then you have men sleeping with animals it's also love so what is love those six steps or seven steps is not love there's only one love and that's the Holy Ghost and you don't want it you message groups don't want it and he says that in rejected King when the angel told him that love is the Holy Ghost rejected King is the Holy Ghost rejected of course it was rejected in this message they didn't want to jump they didn't want to have that Pompa do mix up they didn't want to act like maniacs but I'm like Paul my father in the way that Paul Harris say I'll serve the god of my fathers if they don't like it I don't care I'm like David I will dance before the ark because love rejoices in the ark [Applause] come on [Applause] and I don't know how you feel hermanus if you feel like your pastor then you'll do what your pastor do if he dances you will dance [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Applause] [Music] Love Comes weaker as it comes into almost sexuality and then God said Michael Gabriel step into this why Lord he says we're going to take a little stroll [Applause] where to Lord going down to the plains of memory who's in the plains of memory is a plain and simple guy by the name of Abraham [Music] [Applause] but I'm not going to visit Abraham I want to visit Sarah [Music] when God comes into the flesh he don't worry about the prophets he worries about his bride [Applause] [Music] and if God comes into a flesh now he don't care about anything else for great is a mystery of godliness God men are pasted in the flesh [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] he says on the Holy Ghost take 1958. and they come all the way down from a couple to folio love and down to lustful love to the lowest than God himself became man when it comes to the lowest of love then God puts on flesh [Music] when man comes to their lowest and they reject love because the Bible says in Matthew 24 it says that this is what it says for the love the Holy Ghost of many shall wax cold when it comes to that step is the love works cold in the church what love the Holy Ghost it's the Holy Ghost accepted that's why he put the quote in the rejected King because a rejected King is the Holy Ghost [Music] he even takes it for the book the Hebrew book page 157 you can go and read it oh El Tabernacle we can't read the spoken word like thing we're really different because we duck people [Applause] and we're drinking strange Waters plus his strange Waters you hurt it's true never heard it before that makes El Tabernacle so unique and it makes the ministry unique and make people want to know more and you know the quote I gave it to you in the Sin of unbelief he says the word the Holy Ghost is a quick to give than the word amen it's great to lie because you wrote the word says brother I said the Holy Ghost said [Applause] [Music] that's what I'm preaching now amen came out of brother Branham but I say that the Holy Ghost gave it to me because everybody read it and they don't know anything about it and they never ever mention it and they never ever preach it and they never ever testify about it and they never ever wrote about it but there's one Oddball a man that has grabbed it and heard it and preach it and now it is revealed in the Tabernacle [Applause] [Applause] oh my love what is it because faith is love on the battlefield it heals sickness and raise the Dead virtue is love that goes out to others a time to laugh knowledge is love in respond it response to everything knowledge Temperance is love in training controlling your tongue patience is love patience is love in all situations godliness is love incompleteness because God is alive [Applause] El Tabernacle in Africa what are you listening to you're not listening to a preacher you're listening to an apostle of God that gets the word out of the mouth of God [Applause] [Applause] [Music] brotherly kindness is love in action loving your brothers action not with talk action showing action loving for your brother action esteeming your brother higher than yourself that's love in action [Music] and the Holy Ghost is a loving self [Music] [Applause] can you say man man [Applause] Oh My ultimate you can't finish the tapes that I preach there's too much meat on the bone El Tabernacle is more worth than all the tides that you pay those are two year now your Tides can't pay for it God will pay me when I get there [Applause] [Applause] I ask you to support me and you did and that's why you get this because you support me and along you support me I'm telling you you're gonna get it [Applause] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] now we're preaching What is love somebody somebody somebody somewhere has quoted [Music] [Applause] that's why when you go to Corinthians 13 and you read about love the only thing it shows him it says love Saturday long that's the Fruit of the Spirit it's a love is kind of Brotherly kindness that's a fruit of the spirit Corinthians says love envied not is another fruit of the spirit because it's got kindness with it [Music] amen it's gentle another fruit of the spirit I'm reading Corinthians 13. [Music] it's not easy provoke why because it's full of joy it's a fruit of the spirit it beared all things amen that's the Fruit of the Spirit patience like job beareth all things is the Fruit of the Spirit I'm in Corinthians 13. it believe all things another fruit heir to your faith Faith believes God it's a fruit of the spirit I just want to read Corinthians 13 here First Corinthians 13. I just want to read it and I mention it to you but now let me read it verse 4 5 and 6. love charity suffer of law fruit of the spirit love is kind fruit of the spirit charity fruit of the spirit love Galatians 5 and the fruit of the spirit is alive it goes deeper I'm coming to that then we can close vaunted not itself is not puffed up because it's got a joy unspeakable do not behave itself unseemingly you listen to me amen you shut up Bishop if you don't say the Holy Ghost is a love then you shut up [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] the Lord the Bible [Applause] we could not own fruit of the spirit is not easy to provoke think of No Evil and verse 6 Rejoice not in iniquity but rejoice in the truth now watch Galatians at the same God that wrote this road Galatians and in Galatians he comes and he says Galatians 5 22 he says and the Fruit of the Spirit is love now you don't say love and the spirit is the same thing now he makes love the fruit [Applause] and he don't stop there he says now the truth of the spirit is love and not love is and now the Holy Ghost is the fruit of the spirit but the fruit of the spirit is love love is a fruit why is love a fruit because love wasn't there before the foundation of the world there was no hate there because Lucifer was not even created so there was no hate there so love wasn't there but the spirit was there [Applause] now Paul says my brother the fruit of the spirit is love and what does he do next he says love joy Out of Love Comes Joy now how could they have love and they don't have joy because Paul says out of the spirit comes love Out of Love Comes Joy [Applause] [Applause] oh my thank you [Applause] you can't love without the Holy Ghost because the Holy Ghost bath love that's why the Holy Ghost must lead you up the stairs in my guide he says that because what he's leading you into is his fruit it's Galatians 5 22. so they take the fruit as love the fruit is not love it's a fruit of love the Holy Ghost amen I'm going to close I think you're blown out the bulbs are going like this out of love come Joy so give Jesus king God a boasting shout here [Music] [Applause] [Applause] foreign [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] just another five minutes this is the way you should read First Corinthians 13. this is the way you ought to read it though I speak with the tongue of men and angels and don't have the baptism of the Holy Spirit I'm a sounding grass and a tinkling symbol this is the way the proper way to read it and though I have the gift of Prophecy and I understand all the Seven Seals and understand serpent seed and I understand the Mysteries that William Branham brought though I know all those Mysteries but if I don't have the baptism of the Holy Ghost Paul says you are nothing though you're 40 years in the message amen and you don't have the baptism of the Holy Ghost you are nothing [Applause] [Applause] though you are a big preacher a Treasurer a trusting a deacon amen a member for 40 years Amen in the message though you quote the prophet like this without the baptism of the Holy Ghost you are nothing [Music] though you'll have faith to remove mountains seven Thunders and seven Thunders and seven Thunders and nobody ever got the faith of it why because without the baptism of the Holy Ghost nothing works go you bestowed your goods to feed the poor and you don't have the baptism of the Holy Ghost it profits you nothing being in an end time Church you miss it you won't be considered Moses was not considered when he didn't have it God wanted to kill him because he didn't give it to his son brother Branham was not considered that's what his wife and his child was taken and you pastors think you're gonna make it when the prophet was actually a man under judgment when he didn't take it you're not going to be considered [Applause] I'm closing my God I'm closing love poinsure to the Holy Ghost as I said Colossians 5 26 2 says the fruit of the spirit is love thy doesn't say death love is equal with the Holy Ghost it says that's but just the fruit the same writer and I Echo amen why now you think love is going to save you love don't save you it doesn't the Bible says by Grace I will say not by Allah oh my it's so much deeper it's so much deeper love is the Fruit of the Spirit it leads us so deep the holy spirit will give you love so if you don't have the baptism of the Holy Ghost your Void of perfect love you might have love but one of the other loves because Romans 5 5 says the love of God is abroad in your hearts by the Holy Ghost [Applause] love comes into your heart only by the Holy Ghost so what is the Holy Ghost lost so how are you going to get love if the Holy Ghost supposed to put it in your heart so El Tabernacle you're right there you're right there with a Bible and with what brother Branham says and with Apostle anointing it [Applause] [Music] [Applause] let me lay it down the prophet says in Israel and the church page 51. paragraph 122. he says the holy spirit is the love of God I can prove it by the Bible he's challenging them he knows they don't know it because he never knew it and the word comes to the prophet and a prophet gives you to the apostle and the Apostle makes it clear because man comes behind me I can prove it by the Bible and we proved it by the Bible too [Music] so what is love What is love joburg What is love Pretoria What is love hermanus What is love [Applause] [Applause] rejected King 1960 he preached this quality others he already preached now I always wondered you know I always wondered when I read eleventh commandment how come in 11 Commandments he rebukes Canada so bad very bad don't read it or put the tape on and I thought now this man is preaching on love how can he rebuke the people can't you just forgive them or just look over it no he rebuked them writing that book and I couldn't understand it and when God opened it to me he says no he was showing you to love because love is corrective agopo love is corrective and that's why he rebuked them because they had no joy they were stiff and stodgy and stale and dead conservative and the Holy Ghost says I'm preaching on love and you have no joy and if he built them made this message churches that's dead May the year the prophets rebuke them [Applause] I'm closing it's better to light a candle in the dark then to curse the darkness so what is love let us read rejected King 1916 515. if there be those here listen to him he's praying now if there be those here Lord who doesn't know you in that way of love they know the other way of love nicey nicey one the folio one the one that compromises so that everybody can like them they know that one but it's big clear about that one is the one we're preaching on now if there's anybody that don't know it that's a love now watching watching without that type of a love then he says what type of a love the new birth the being born again the Holy Ghost is love if there's anyone here that don't understand it Lord may you open their eyes that the Holy Ghost is love [Applause] open our eyes in El Tabernacle for the scripture and the Bible say the same thing and the Apostle anoint said I'm an anointing it [Applause] I'm closing brother branches and restoration of the bright tree he says the canker worm has added away the joy of the church and then he said shh you're making too much a noise he says it's a Kinko worm but an oddball from Johannesburg [Applause] kills that canker worm and now it's even in Cape Town give God a shout here I killed it I killed it I killed it I killed it I killed it I killed it I killed it I killed it [Applause] [Music] [Applause] I'm gonna close for the love of many wax cold many vexed the Holy Ghost and it took its flight and the churches is cold they tried to clap their hands they can't even collect them why because the love of many [Applause] and now we're closing and as he calls on that message the wings of a snow white now it says Lord on the wings I will slow life down God said he's pure sweet love who brings love the wings of the dark what's the dog the Holy Ghost [Music] [Applause] [Music] I'm closing and I want you to be like Noah and not like the message group Noah broke open the word because the word kept the dove in bondage the ark he couldn't fly but we want to right now release the dove because on its ways is the love of God if the Holy Ghost fly in here don't reject him if the Holy Ghost flies in here don't push him aside if the Holy Ghost flies in here lift up your hands and says not my mother my mother is not my father it's not my brother it's not my sister to me it's me standing in the need of prayer as the dove fly over this audience we're releasing yes you can feel him I know you came he's flying in this bowling right now [Music] on the wings of a Snow White so let the dark lie we're not keeping in prison raise your hands and say Lord It's Me it's me standing in the need of prayer Lord don't cage up the door open the door of your heart let him fly out of the Ark and settle on your ground with all I believe in his mouth [Music] oh I just want the dog to lead me home I just want the dove to lead me home I just want the dove to lead me home

finish this quote and then may God bless you he says further the Holy Spirit God is love we know that is true no matter if we remove mountains now he's showing us to Corinthians 30. by our faith if we did great things still without that without the baptism of the Holy Ghost we could never climb that great ladder can't climb it but with it we have cliented look at it the love of God bless you on the
