TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] Amen. We greet you all in the name of Jesus [Applause] Christ. We are here to unveil a stone and it's not any stone. We are here to identify that El Tabernacle has moved across southern Africa. We are here yet to identify that the man has come around. [Applause] We are here to identify that God is in somebody because how can these things be and how can we wor witness so many miracles in El Tabernacle like we are ministering and seeing every day. So once again, we are witnesses to Pastor Ja down here in the Eastern Cape as he follows the star. [Applause] And I'd like to tell the believers and our pastor Ja, don't follow us, follow the dove. [Applause] because the dove knows the way home. So let us pray. Lord, we come to you as your apostle vision for El Tabernacle is continuing. We are yet to unveil El Tabernacle stone, a stone that is of great essence for the hour we're living in. May you come and bless us as we prepare for the service. Lord, may you come and bless each one of these here has come to witness this day. We give you all the praise, all the glory in Jesus name. Amen and amen. [Applause] Are you happy? Don't look at Paul says, "Wherefore, because they sought it not by faith, but as it were by works of the law, for they stumbled at the stumbling stone. As it is written, Behold, I lay in Z a stumbling stone, a rock which going to be an offense to everybody. And whosoever believeth on him to stone his person. So even there are people that still are confused about him because he's a rock of offense. He's a stumbling stone. You must stumble when he is there. You have big question mark cuz it's he is a stumbling stone. Hallelujah. But he says I'll put that stumbling stone in El Tabernacle. Whoever believe on him will will [Music] be saved. [Music] [Applause] So that's why we are here. So we are here to identify him because it's his stone, his ministry here in the eastern. So pastor Ja follow that stumbling stone and you will be saved with everybody that comes here. Nobody will like the stone. Everybody hates it cuz it's offensive. It tramps on your toes. Tells you you're not right. You can put any tape on, you will hear. It's a rock of offense. But it's God's stone. And in closing, the stone that the builders has rejected is the rejected one. The one that's rejected in the message is become the head of Elwood, El Tabernacle Church. Amen. So, Pastor Ja, you and your wife, can you just open it up for us? Praise the Lord. We are we got lot of these stones across South Africa where sister Maris will be in Heras to change that one to white. We will be there brother. Thank you. But this is how it is from vend right across on every church building of El Tabernacle. It's the church ages Jesus and the megers. Then it has the cross and a star and the seven thunders because the seven thunders is the messengers that El tabernacle follows. Amen. And it's to the glory of God and it's got love and faith and all the virtues. It's got the names of the messengers and it gives you every church age. He has scriptures here. If you want to have scriptures to read before you go into church, there's scriptures given for you before you come in here. It will give you insight to what else heaven. It's written there. That's why we put it down there. Now I know you just walk into church but if you're in Bloomington Estras wherever those scriptures down and read it which I know you didn't see you just put your hand on it but there's scriptures there to be read that the apostle put for a reason and all this has been laid by the apostle E H Ros Rosco all of you boulder and founder of Eaban. He's our rose because he says I am the rose of Sher. He's our rose. And it says here it was done on the of the 2025. Let's give a lot of shabbak for that. [Applause] Amen. God bless you.
