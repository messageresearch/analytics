[7:06] feel the power of
[7:08] yesterday is still with
[7:11] us amen verse
[7:14] 21
[7:15] beloved if you if if your heart condemn
[7:19] us not then have we confidence toward
[7:22] God and whatever we ask we receive of
[7:26] him because we keep his commandment and
[7:29] do those things that are pleasing in his
[7:33] side
[7:35] amen once again may the Lord had a
[7:38] blessing upon the reading of his word I
[7:40] just want to read a quote before we
[7:42] start preaching before we start praying
[7:44] amen one is used to preaching
[7:49] amen the quote is from the book of the
[7:53] Apostle a call to
[7:56] prayer it says it's from communion he
[7:59] abstract from communion it says you
[8:04] see each day we've got to commune with
[8:08] Christ we've got to talk to him each day
[8:13] so if your physical body need food each
[8:16] day to survive your spiritual body needs
[8:20] spiritual food and communion with the
[8:23] Lord each day to survive so each day we
[8:27] have to go to to start stud the Bible
[8:30] but a real real believer that's really
[8:34] spiritually built up he reads his Bible
[8:37] every day and he talks to the Lord
[8:40] that's right
[8:42] amen and we also have the guideline that
[8:45] we have to
[8:47] follow I think this guideline
[8:50] is we have it on our
[8:53] phones amen everyone has this guideline
[8:56] is the guideline that we're going to
[8:58] follow thanking him for saving your soul
