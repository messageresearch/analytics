TRANSCRIPT
========================================
uh good evening El tle it's uh as again we thought about making uh this video clip again uh because things as I told you the last time things are happening so fast that um we can't keep up um because you know you know our ministry is not a ordinary Ministry is is um Apostolic which brother Braham says it's evangelism and uh prophetic uh combin U make the apostolic uh Ministry so it's not an ordinary minist Ministry by taking a word and and expounding on a word and you know but it's uh based more on what brother brandham has prophesied on the prophetic side and um getting the sense of it now we we have anointed that quote for many years in birth pains that brother Bram says men will come after me and make more SS because brother brandham didn't have enough time on many topics that he he actually um uh preached on and prophesied so um uh I think that's the reason he he put that quote out so I I just uh want to remind you about what I heard believe Paul told us when brother B preached on the rapture how that woman went on brother brandham didn't have enough time to finish it because she was running at the back then and waving and telling brother Brandon we must stop and the prophet uh really couldn't put uh his teeth into the thing so uh he um just said enough for the five minut to pick it up and uh uh and Mak sense to it and and and a lot of you know statue of a perfect man all those quotes uh messages so we uh are yeah and U with the prophecy and the the seven visions of brother brandham to actually uh make more sense to it and uh we uh have dissected it and when we saw these things happening the Prophecies of brother brandham came to our attention and that's the reason we busy that's why we say that U we uh we're just different our ministry is different our preaching is different Paul says You Preach according to your faith you know so this is according to our faith on the prophetic level not that we are prophets but brother brandham you know brother sister we in a prophetic class so prophetic class needs a prophet uh to preach to them so brother Brandon preached to us and us in the prophetic class could understand him and further break it down so uh I thought let me just tell you that and uh I uh have entitled the thing is it Camila's is Camila Harris uh uh then the earthquake is it she first and then the earthquake so I got reason why I said so I I'll show you Clips just now that really shocked me so I thought uh let me get back to you because I won't be here um next week on Friday uh we'll be in Angola so I thought uh we'll make this video club for Friday so that you can be on par on what's happening in the world so listen I'm only venturing in I'm only pondering like brother Val used to like this word pondering let's Ponder I'm only pondering I'm only saying could it be or predicting not prophesying in that this thing might be in this sequence so I have the sequence that I feel it might be that way and you know we we all have our own ideas and we have uh our own Inspirations how it'll happen but God is the one that actually put it really in in sequence so uh I have the elections which is going on now and then uh after that the 70 weeks of Daniel and the 70th Jubilee uh running out um in September and uh you know that uh the um rabis is now really on this thing about September where the jubilees is running out and um and point number three is uh could it do money will fail in Statue of a perfect man after that and could after that be the earthquake and could after the earthquake be right in the seventh Vision when Elijah and Moses will be coming to 144,000 and uh could it be in that sequence which is actually the end of the world we know that the ab bomb which is the end of the world will that five things happen like there and the pope sits in Jerusalem and break the treaty now I gave you the quote nothing wrong with probing brother Bram tells you that and SS is a time there's nothing wrong in probing when you probe you just when going to see can it be so that's why he say says is this the time he was probing and uh although it was thus say the Lord and um so we we we only proing so um we have listened to Trump on the on the club of trump uh Trump saying Camila Harris is a beautiful human uh uh woman so let's listen to him Time Magazine think of this Time Magazine doesn't have a picture of her they have this unbelievable artist drawing her and I said is that Sophia Laura and I couldn't who might that be is that Elizabeth Taylor they say she was a beautiful woman who is it so beautiful drawing it's a drawing they took a lot of pictures it didn't work out so they hired a sketch artist I said I'm sure oh they must be celebrating the great Life and Times of the magnificently beautiful Sophia Lauren and you're not allowed to say this anymore you know David don't ever get caught in this trap David please don't ever call a woman beautiful because that'll be the end of your political career please I want to make your life much easier David by the way he's also got a great wife I have to say he's got a great wife but you know I mean I read a a so-called Republican who Ronald Reagan didn't like by the way and she didn't like him but she got credit for being this Reagan speech writer highly overrated I don't know anything about her I don't know her treats me badly but that's okay she called it wrong she's called it wrong now for about eight years but she said one thing that got me she said kamla has one big Advantage she's a very beautiful woman she's a [Music] so I decid to go back and reread the Clause I'm not saying he's but I say that I am much better looking than her I think I'm much better much better I'm a better looking person then CA well there you have it um the um the beauty of Kamala is now now we have the Roman Catholic Church beautiful and now they are saying that Chamilia is but beautiful so imagine being an uh opponent or R rival saying this and we have the prophet saying she look like uh uh she she's a beautiful woman she look like uh he says she you look like Sophia Lauren now if you young people ever saw Sophia Lauren she is also blushing blacking you know she was one of the the Queens in the 60s I think uh but brother brandham also speak about a beautiful woman I wonder if we got a quote then when these women help elect the wrong person then seen a great woman rise up in the United States well-dressed and beautiful but cruel and heart she will either guide or lead this nation to a ruination I got in princes perhaps Catholic Church there you have the quote uh how could brother Brandon 91 years ago say a thing like this and here Trump comes and say the same thing so um it shows you that um it is right in line um with uh What uh the prophet um saw uh 91 years ago 19 uh 33 and uh we could say that that portion of um of the prophecy is fulfilled Trum fulfilled it the other day then the write up on the cover of Time Magazine is um it's a a beautiful picture of her there she is and um we will uh play the quote she'll be a pretty human now both is pretty human as we already played the quote so um and the right up in Time Magazine will take a f things out there the reintroduction of CA Harris excerpts from the article published by Time Magazine inside of Philadelphia Arena on August 6th vice president camela Harris was greeted with a kind of reception a Democratic presidential candidate hasn't G en in years fans packed into overflow spaces waving homemade signs made of glitter and glue as drum lines roared when Harris introduced her new running mate Minnesota Governor Tim Walls the cheering lasted more than a minute if you'd predicted this scene a month ago to anyone following the race they would never have believed you but Harris has pulled off the swiftest vibe shift in modern political history a contest that revolved around the cognitive decline of a geriatric president has been transformed Joe Biden is out Harris is in and a second Donald Trump presidency no longer seems inevitable Democrats resigned to a grim Death March toward certain defeat as one National organizer put it felt their Gloom replaced by a jolt of Hope Harris smashed fundraising records raking in 310 milli in July she packed stadiums and dominated Tik Tock offering a fresh message focused on the future over the past volunteers signed up in droves Trump's widening leads across the Battleground States evaporated over the span of a few weeks in Late July and early August Harris became a political phenomenon our campaign is not just a fight against Donald Trump she told the cheering crowd in Philadelphia our campaign is a fight for the future judging from the past few weeks Harris's own party underestimated her maybe the crowded 2020 primary just wasn't the right race for Harris to Showcase her talents maybe the vice presidency wasn't the right role suddenly she seems matched to the moment a former prosecutor running against a convicted felon a defender of abortion rights running against the man who helped overturn Row versus Wade a Next Generation Democrat running against a 78-year-old Republican perhaps above all she has given Americans the one thing they overwhelmingly told polsters they wanted a credible alternative to the two unpopular old men who have held the job for the past eight long years Harris may still be the dog Trump has arguably the clearer path to 270 electoral votes and an edge on the issues that voters say are most important to them she inherited a campaign infrastructure and policy record from her predecessor but the energy is all hers picking walls as a running mate over more conventional choices signals a belief that this race is as much about feelings as it is about fundamentals Harris's brand shift the happy warrior attitude the viral memes the iroll at Republican weirdos has already done what no Trump opponent has ever been able to do snatch the spotlight away from him she may seem like an overnight sensation but Harris's moment was years in the making quietly her small team of top AIDS had been laying the groundwork for a future presidential run after the Supreme Court's dobs decision the vice president added Reproductive Rights to her portfolio abortion was never a comfortable issue for Biden a devout Catholic but it was a natural fit for his number two Harris believed that with Rog gone Republicans would turn their sights to restricting both birth control and IVF in the months after dobs she traveled the us talking about abortion rights as a matter of reproductive Freedom as far back as the 2022 midterms Aid say she argued for making this the core of the party's National message even as the White House focused on jobs and the economy with Biden no longer a top the ticket the morban Democratic Grassroots came to life Harris was capable of delivering a message that never felt quite right under Clinton or Biden that theirs was the party of the future and Trump was of the past her campaign raised $200 million in the first week in what it said was the best 24 hours of any candidate in presidential campaign history more than 38,000 people registered on vote.org in the 48 hours after she became the presumptive nominee eclipsing the voter registration surge encouraged by Taylor Swift Last year within a week Harris erased Trump's polling dominance in key States turning a burgeoning landslide into a dead heat elections come down to Vibes and CA has got the Vibes right now says David hog co-founder of the genz political organization leaders we deserve after spending his entire political career organizing against Trump and his allies hog explains it felt good to finally have someone to vote for people are feeling the type of energy they felt during the Obama campaign says Michigan state senator Darren caleri who spends his weekends door knocking in his competitive District South of Detroit it feels different than with Hillary different than with Biden celebrities like Charlie XCX and Megan the stallion came out in support of Paris speaking in a packed airplane hanger in Detroit UAW president sha Fain called her a badass woman the campaign's new Harris walls camo hats sold out within half an hour Grassroots groups are seeing an explosion in fundraising and volunteer signups my niece who called Biden genocide Joe called me to say auntie I want to do something recall S leosha brown co-founder of black voters matter the shift is perhaps most visible in the digital sphere while millions of Hardcore Democrats would crawl over broken glass to keep Trump from reelection less reliable voters in gen Z are especially attuned to online trends for months President Biden's online supporters have been on the defensive about his support for Israel's war against Hamas comments about Gaza flooded Pro Biden content posted to social platforms making it difficult to create what digital strategists call a permission structure to support him to many it evoked the online mobs who would mock Clinton's supporters in 2016 preventing her from building traction on social media in 2016 if you wanted to be an online supporter of Hillary Clinton you did it in a private Facebook group says Litman in 2024 you blasted on Tik Tok and you're part of the kive and you make your username the coconut tree her early months as VP were checkered too big interviews went poorly Harris seemed ill-prepared and unsteady on her feet Biden reportedly vented to a friend that she was a work in progress he saddled her with a portfolio of difficult thankless work like addressing the root causes of the flow of undocumented immigrants from Central America's Northern triangle by 2023 Harris had the lowest approval ratings for a vice president in history it's always hard for the vice president because the president is the one setting the policy taking the responsibility says represent ative Adam Schiff a California Democrat and close Ally of Harris and historically vice presidents have often taken on the work that the president doesn't want to do another Democrat puts it more bluntly they set her up to fail from day one one challenge for Harris has been the people around her over the years a rotating cast of senior staff has clouded her message and raised questions about her abilities as a manager she needs a few political consiliari in her life she doesn't have a North star guiding her says one Democratic strategist she has made novice political moves that the political Elite and the pundits have glommed on to that have pushed the narrative that she's not ready for prime time that narrative has been out of date for some time according to allies who have worked with her and watched her closely Harris has mastered the art of arm twisting required to pass major legislation and become a global Diplomat championing Democratic goals she has gone Booker says from being a Padawan to a Jedi master yet if Harris was widely underestimated it's also true that her circumstances have radically changed success in politics is situational Harris no longer has to compete with more than 20 other democrats for attention on the campaign Trail or contort herself to appease liberal pities to win over the party's base she no longer has to be a loyal Deputy to the president who calls all the shots now the moment is finally hers Republicans admit Harris will be harder to beat than a diminished Biden but they believe the candidate Riding High the past few weeks will soon under sustained attack come down to earth if she runs the same kind of campaign she ran in 2019 and 20120 her campaign will collapse and Donald Trump will Waltz into the White House Republican pollster Whit a says on the other hand if she has learned as much as her allies and friends say she has in the last four years she will give Trump a real run for his money Harris is more popular with younger black and Latino voters than Biden was when he dropped out of the race according to polling which puts her in a stronger position to win the Sun Belt states at the same time she may be losing ground with older white voters which makes her more vulnerable in the trio of blue wall States Michigan Pennsylvania and Wisconsin that form that core of the Democrats Electoral College strategy to shore up those States Harris is is leaning on her major labor endorsements and making multiple visits to the Upper Midwest Harris inherited Biden's campaign infrastructure including more than 260 outposts across the Battleground States in Nevada the Harris campaign has 13 field officers to Trump's one in Pennsylvania it has 36 coordinated officers to Trump's 3 according to a campaign memo in the first 12 days of her camp campaign Harris supporters placed 2.3 million phone calls and made 172,000 house visits while Battleground organizers are knocking on swing voters doors the campaign's digital strategy is designed partly around reaching hard-to-reach voters and convincing them to choose between our candidate and the couch says Deputy campaign manager Rob Flaherty the Avalanche of viral memes about Harris the enthusiastic Tik Tok videos and the massive Zoom calls of devoted supporters black women for Harris white dudes for Harris Latino men for Harris have made this task easier that's the kind of enthusiasm that money can't buy Flaherty says but Harris's moment also comes after eight years of transformation and Triumph for American women after Clinton's stinging defeat in 2016 women flooded the streets in the largest protest March in US history then formed a massive Grassroots electoral movement that helped Democrats overperform in most elections since the attack lines from the Republicans are going to be on Race and gender and those are going to work to her Advantage says Ashley etn a former communications director for the vice president all that was baggage is is now an asset amen I hope that you have uh listened carefully to that clip and it's all human human human human and um and human cause the fall we know that just if you take Genesis then you'll see the Decay that's brought by a woman woman fell with a silen in Genesis 3:6 lch had two wives Genesis 2 vers 23 which is polygamy it broke down further Genesis 62 they took themselves wives fre sex out of wedlock fornication Genesis 63 Abram two wives Genesis 1934 lot SL with his own daughters which is incest Genesis 345 sex of its children D not fell Genesis 195 hos sexuality that is just in Genesis how the moral Decay came just there not even any place else in the Bible just in Genesis and here we have a scenario where it's all woman as I said with the last clip that we put on so we see that this was in Time Magazine time says is this the time brother Bram says so we can say is this the time and season when humans going to cause the fall of the world then the next thing that happens which is ironic the Moon Over Australia they called a blue moon if we can get the right up and the club bar tonight you have the chance to see a rare super Blue Moon just step outside or just watch right here this is a live look right now at the moon shining in the night sky cvsa Jasmine Ramirez joins us in studio right now to tell us why this moon is considered to be so rare yeah that's right Marcel and this live look is pretty great tonight's moon it's supposed to be really bright and really big now having a super Blue Moon just anything like this really it only happens about every 10 years a super blue moon is a Celestial phenomenon tonight it was captured around the globe here you can see it glowing in Turkey Rising into the night sky in Greece shining in Portugal and peeking through the clouds in Australia the big excitement is just for the public to look up see a very bright beautiful full moon tonight I talked with Douglas Leonard a professor of astronomy at San Diego State he says a super moon happens when the moon is at its closest point to the Earth this makes it appear super big and super bright next I asked him what a blue moon is if you happen to have four full moons in one season like summer Okay the third of those full four full moons is called a blue moon so just how how rare is it to have a super blue moon to have a blue moon and which occurs about every every two or 3 years and a super moon which occurs about 25% of the time to have those two things occur together on one full moon happens about every decade and so that's what makes it a bit interesting that's why he recommends going outside and catching a glimpse of it this is such a cool event because it's something that everyone can enjoy that everyone can see easily and appreciate Maxwell palao is an astronomer here in San Diego taking photos of the moon and stars is one of his favorite things to do he has advice if you want to capture tonight's moon but if you really want to capture the best way to do it is to either have a pair of binoculars or a telescope and then put your iPhone or your Android device and put right up against the eyepiece and then take a picture of the Moon it'll look incredible and tonight's clear skies in San Diego will also help give a clear view of the moon now it's best to go outside and see it now I'm told the next Super Blue Moon it likely won't happen until 2037 Marcela that's so interesting so you know you hear the phrases once in a blue moon so that's great that you explained why it's rare to have a super moon and also Blue Moon and then people hear the word blue and they're looking at the photo thinking like does it have a little bit of a blue hue is the moon really blue or why does this you know why is it called a blue moon right no I asked that exact same question I did learn the term Blue Moon is really used to describe the third full moon in a season with four of them now in this case we're having four full moons this summer amen no no why we saw on this is because uh the day that Biden resigned I showed you the very night in New York City around the statue of Liberty she was covered or she's been in or behind her was a red moon why did we have this all at one time and we know what the moon represents when brother BR say Pope went to Israel and he showed you how the moon changed until it blackened out and then too in brandham Tabernacle the angel came down and through the seven Church ages as seven moons and the last one was totally dark and brother Bron put a little light in there that's why it represents the church ages resent represents a woman so why is is it's so explicit this time with the moon does he tell us because as above so below he put those things in the heavens as signs and seasons and Genesis says is this a sign that that woman is going to come in and you could have looked for the this week most of the week we had full full moons so it's so unusual the ordinary Moon full and then you had a blue moon you had a red moon everything is Moon which is a human so could them I'm asking could them be a sign that that woman is here if not you heard they can't even tell you the why of the matter they don't even go back to the the the day uh Biden resigned and there was a red moon so there is Def defitely a significance uh I'm sure if brother Brandon was around he wouldn't have left this thing because it's it's a strange phenomena what we are seeing happening just with the moons so as I said as above so below and then the thing that hit me last week in Monday is the earthquake she nearly went why is all these things right in the circle of Camila and it's been shaking ever since so I thought that we will have the clips um on that Quake watch it oh my [Applause] oh my God oh my oh my oh my God isn't that scary we that know what happened when brother Bram preached on choosing a bride how brother brandham puts this in choosing of a bride just take another listen to it I know you heard this but to see a thing happens and then go back to what brother brandham says in the prophecy it's really shaking I do not know I thank God for this guy that came to me he says you know brother Rosco um the things that you have put out there is really scaring it it it buckles my knees I says not only you my brother I am also shaken to see such a lot of things happen at the same time that speaking about meeting the Messiah you know because the seven Visions is before meeting the Messiah you know the earthquake is I'm going to tell you just now what it is it's also to do with the Messiah listen to how it is put in sincerity from the prophet thou City who claims to be the city of the Angels who's exalted yourself into heaven and sent all the dirty filthy things of Fashions and things the even the foreign countries come here to pick up our filth and send it away with your fine churches and Steeples and so forth the way you do remember one day you will be laying in the bottom botom of the sea you're a great honeycom under you right now the wrath of God is belching right beneath you how much longer you'll hold this sandb hanging out over that on that ocean out under a mile deep will slide in there Plum back to the salt and sea it'll be worse than the last day of pompe repent Los Angeles repent the rest of you and turn to God the hour of his Wrath upon the Earth flee while there's time to flee and come into Christ listen to that voice of urgency of desperation and here Monday it was nearly so nearly the only thing is the sequence that 144,000 has to be sealed and this woman must first come in otherwise Los Angeles would have been gone last week look how it look how it actually went just in the street how those cars were shifting look at the buildings collapsing it was like the africanis umerus nearly nearly gone 4 for earthquake so that's what the Bible says as I'm going to read it it's spoken in The Sixth Seal this earthquake Revelation 6:12 a great earthquake then spoken of this of it in the seventh trumpet Revelations 11:13 seven trumpet the Seven Seals same thing verse 192 it speaks about it then it speaks about it in the seventh vial the earthquake the biggest earthquake ever Revelation 16:18 then the great quake in Matthew 282 when the graves was open is this what's going to happen when Los Angeles open will Matthew 28 and Matthew 27 51 and 52 when the dead in Christ shall rise with this earthquake will this be like that that's why when I see a thing like this and I see it in the scripture and I see brother brandham say it I have no doubt I don't care what the critic says it's going to come to pass and as I say it nearly happened last week August month so let's take another clip you might be wondering have we been having more of them than normal well we did get the answer for you tonight and it is yes we are having the most seismically active year in almost four decades and experts say the shaking is likely to continue another earthquake hit Southern California this time near Lake Elenor it happened this morning around 9:30 the magnitude 3.9 earthquake rocked homes but so far no damage has been reported this is the third sizable earthquake in Southern California in just a couple of days Southern California has experienced multiple earthquakes this week as I'm sure all of you know and this is a good reminder now is the time to prepare for an even larger one through the Northridge Earthquake so you know the first thing I said is I think the big one's coming guys Judith gold the owner of Luca natural goods and Highland Park remembers the progression of smaller Quakes leading up to a very destructive one I know that this is the signs that a bigger earthquake is probably going to come I mean I hope I'm wrong it passes us but it usually that's how it was um before the nor northri earthquake some breaking news of 4.4 earthquake hitting the Las Vegas Valley tonight according to USGS Quake hit about 806 about 4 miles Northwest of Indian Springs Nevada the Quake was 5.8 Mi deep Indian Springs is home to Cree Air Force Base is 45 Mi Northwest of the Las Vegas Strip there were no immediate reports of any injuries or damage as you'd expect of a quake of this size but it was felt in a wide area of Nevada the recent earthquake that jolted the Southland is sparking concern and highlighting a much smaller but potentially more threatening fault line the fault running from the Pasadena area to Puente Hills has been very very active in recent months all the way over in Santa Monica a cam facing the pier shows the power of the large shocks well so far there's been a few after shocks but nothing significant two months ago there was actually a smaller quick That Shook that exact same area here in La a lot more recently and did feel a few of those but not nothing that strong as what we just felt in South PAAD from 2013 to 2023 Dr Jones says there was an average of five magnitude four or stronger shakers but 2024 has been a lot more volatile already this year there have been 13 magnitude 4 or stronger Quakes this year is now an active year again 2024 has had more earthquakes than any year we've seen since 1988 here's seismologist Dr Lucy Jones we had a six on this on this system in 1987 and it was like 350 million doll in damage and three direct deaths so when we've modeled what would it be like to have a 7 and a half on the penty Hills thrust we get 10 times as much damage as we see for a 7.9 on the San Andreas because we have so many more buildings and people on top of an earthquake if it's pente Hills Monday's 4.4 magnitude earthquake happened in the same area as a 3.4 magnitude earthquake June 2nd and both produced aftershocks nearby so they're all in about the same location uh within somewhere within the Plenty Hills thrust system so what should the everyday californi take from that not much we have earthquakes this is a great reminder that all of Southern California is earthqu country every one of us in the Los Angeles metropolitan area is within 5 miles of an active fault and which one of those are going to go within our lifetime is random scientists at Yellowstone National Park telling us this was a random event happening without warning some wild new vide showing an explosion at Yellowstone National Park a geyser going off sending tourists running for cover run run run Park officials closed the biscuit Basin area while they surveyed the damage the area is home to several geysers in pools including the sapphire pool which had a similar eruption in 1991 what happened is that an unusual event where a lot of pressure built up and with that so much pressure it again forced its way out it erupted officials say there did not appear to be any signs of an imminent volcanic eruption well that's good news geologists are investigating what exactly happened the scientist in charge with the Yellowstone volcano Observatory says this is not connected to volcanic activity which is often associated with the part well David scientists at Yellowstone tell us that this was a random event without warning still they are investigating exactly what happened and what it might mean for the future of this area David the last time an explosion similar to this happened at Yellowstone's biscuit Basin was back in 2009 yeah that was really something to see MOA thank you amen isn't it scary doesn't that shake a religious conceptions and arguments to put it one side and concentrate on Modern events that prophecy is making clear that we that is in this message we that's walking in this message for over 56 years heard and quoted these things time and time and time again but here it's upon us even the scientist doesn't know when but a scary point is 2024 why 2024 Kam's here the earthquakes has has actually tripled up so where are we at so El Tabernacle as your pastor I cannot help but put it in front in front of you I cannot bring something positive but a negative thing for what I see because I'm am reminded of what brother brandham says this earth needs a funeral service to be preached to and if there ever was a time that this earth needs a funeral service is now and wake up people to the fact that hey is no more F in the future it's on our doorstep it's right here we cannot try and put this thing under the carpet anymore it is staring us right in the face so so I thought that that would be a good thing then I ask you with a combin see that you finished pay your credits why because in Genesis 47:15 money failed in the land of Egypt we know that that is part and parcel of Camila coming in she's going to let America get busted up we know that brother Brenham said that in Statue of a perfect man and it's funny whenever you have a perfect man money goes in Genesis you had Joseph a perfect man and money failed when Jesus came and money was the issue 30 pieces of silver the Rich Young Ruler you know and um a laborous worth his wage and all those things it's always money when a perfect man comes is there another perfect man now that we see money is falling I think so I think that there is a bride that's nearly near Perfection when God is going to let money fail again now let us again listen to brother brandham Lifeline the other morning well you know it's just like you sell Bonds on the go the bonds is already tuck up and this present government now is spending money for what for tax money that they'll be cut in 40 years from now she's done that's Lifeline right out of Washington DC Across the Nation taxes they're spending and trying to buy forign well they're just giving it out anyway don't you see that's exactly what they what they're going to do see what is it now if this nation goes busted the only thing it can do is go busted the only thing it can do is go bankrupt that's the only sensible thing to do change the currency but they won't do it under this presid Administration Roman Catholic Church owns a gold the world and what they'll do is sell out there you are that's what I am looking for now if you are spiritual you see what I'm going to say now kamla Harris is the first Domin Domino to fall you know if that first Domino Falls all the dominoes is falling so we waiting for that first Domino and when we see that all these things earthquakes and Pope and all that then comes into view that all of them isn't going to fall under the prophecy of one of the greatest prophets that ever struck the globe outside of Jesus Christ William mam branam may God bless his heart for giving us the signs of the time and taking all his time and go to Los Angeles and all those places to drop the prophecies that his master gave him so this is all prophecies hanging in the balance it's hanging there will she or Trump fulfill the prophecies will it be it's like a Dustin drum now beating is this behold I come quickly and my reward is with me Revelations 8:13 is then the next thing woe wo wo inhabitants of the earth three woes three world wars will that follow the first war the trumpet blew and got Israel back the second world world war was even worse and More in 1946 actually was going back and Israel became a nation and the third war is the atomic bomb that explodes and not only destroy America but the whole world Revelations 9:12 one war is passed One World War and behold there is coming actually two more WS Revelations 11:14 the second W is passed in other words the second world war is passed and behold the third world cometh quickly
