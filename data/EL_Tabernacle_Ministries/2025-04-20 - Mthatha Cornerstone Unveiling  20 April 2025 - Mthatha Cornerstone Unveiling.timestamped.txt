[0:00] [Music]
[0:01] Amen. We greet you all in the name of
[0:03] Jesus
[0:06] [Applause]
[0:10] Christ. We are here
[0:13] to unveil a stone
[0:17] and it's not any
[0:19] stone. We are here to identify that El
[0:23] Tabernacle has moved across
[0:28] southern Africa.
[0:32] We are here yet to
[0:35] identify that the man has come around.
[0:41] [Applause]
[0:43] We are here to
[0:45] identify that God is in somebody
[0:49] because how can these things
[0:51] be and how can we wor witness so many
[0:57] miracles in El Tabernacle like we are
[1:00] ministering and seeing every day.
[1:04] So once again, we are witnesses
[1:08] to Pastor Ja down here in the Eastern
[1:10] Cape
[1:12] as he follows the star.
[1:16] [Applause]
[1:19] And I'd like to tell the believers and
[1:21] our pastor
[1:23] Ja, don't follow
[1:25] us, follow the dove.
[1:29] [Applause]
[1:34] because the dove knows the way home.
[1:39] So let us pray. Lord, we come to
[1:42] you as your
[1:45] apostle vision for El Tabernacle is
[1:47] continuing.
[1:49] We are yet to unveil El Tabernacle
[1:51] stone,
[1:53] a stone
[1:55] that is of great essence for the hour
[1:58] we're living in.
[2:01] May you come and bless us as we prepare
[2:04] for the service. Lord,
[2:07] may you come and bless each one of these
[2:08] here has come to witness this day.
[2:12] We give you all the praise, all the
[2:15] glory in Jesus name. Amen and amen.
[2:20] [Applause]
[2:28] Are you happy?
[2:32] Don't look
[2:37] at Paul says, "Wherefore, because they
[2:41] sought it not by
[2:43] faith, but as it were by works of the
[2:47] law, for they stumbled at the stumbling
[2:52] stone. As it is written, Behold, I lay
[2:54] in Z a stumbling stone, a rock which
[2:59] going to be an offense to
[3:02] everybody. And whosoever believeth on
[3:04] him to stone his person.
[3:16] So even there are people that still are
[3:19] confused about him
[3:22] because he's a rock of offense.
[3:25] He's a stumbling stone. You must stumble
[3:27] when he is there. You have big question
[3:30] mark cuz it's he is a stumbling stone.
[3:36] Hallelujah. But he says I'll put that
[3:38] stumbling stone in El Tabernacle.
[3:43] Whoever believe on him
[3:45] will will
[3:48] [Music]
[3:49] be saved.
[3:51] [Music]
[3:53] [Applause]
[4:00] So that's why we are
[4:01] here. So we are here to identify him
[4:06] because it's his stone, his
[4:09] ministry here in the eastern.
[4:14] So pastor Ja
[4:16] follow that stumbling stone and you will
[4:20] be saved with everybody that comes here.
[4:27] Nobody will like the stone.
[4:30] Everybody hates it cuz it's offensive.
[4:32] It tramps on your toes. Tells you you're
[4:35] not right.
[4:37] You can put any tape on, you will hear.
[4:41] It's a rock of offense. But it's God's
[4:44] stone.
[4:47] And in
[4:49] closing, the stone that the builders has
[4:52] rejected is the rejected one. The one
[4:55] that's rejected in the message
[4:59] is become
[5:01] the head of
[5:03] Elwood, El Tabernacle Church. Amen.
[5:11] So, Pastor Ja, you and your wife, can
[5:14] you just open it up for us?
[5:29] Praise the Lord.
[5:34] We are we got lot of these stones across
[5:37] South
[5:38] Africa where sister Maris will be in
[5:41] Heras to change that one to white. We
[5:45] will be there brother. Thank you.
[5:51] But this is how it is from vend right
[5:54] across on every church building of El
[5:57] Tabernacle.
[5:58] It's the church ages Jesus and the
[6:01] megers.
[6:03] Then it has the cross and a star and the
[6:06] seven thunders
[6:09] because the seven thunders is the
[6:11] messengers that El tabernacle follows.
[6:15] Amen.
[6:17] And it's to the glory of
[6:20] God and it's got love and faith and all
[6:24] the virtues. It's got the names of the
[6:28] messengers and it gives you every church
[6:32] age. He has scriptures here. If you want
[6:35] to have scriptures to read before you go
[6:37] into church, there's scriptures given
[6:39] for you before you come in here. It will
[6:43] give you insight to what else heaven.
[6:44] It's written there. That's why we put it
[6:46] down there.
[6:51] Now I know you just walk into church but
[6:54] if you're in Bloomington Estras wherever
[6:56] those scriptures down and read
[6:59] it which I know you didn't see you just
[7:02] put your hand on
[7:04] it but there's scriptures there to be
[7:07] read that the apostle put for a reason
[7:13] and all this has been
[7:16] laid by the apostle
[7:20] E
[7:23] H Ros
[7:28] Rosco all of
[7:31] you boulder and founder of
[7:39] Eaban. He's our
[7:42] rose because he says I am the rose of
[7:44] Sher. He's our rose.

[7:50] done on
