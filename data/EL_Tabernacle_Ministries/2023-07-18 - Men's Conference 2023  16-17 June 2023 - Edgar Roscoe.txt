TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] foreign [Music] [Music] Lord we thank you for this morning thank you for this two days that you've given us we can come together as brothers to enjoy you father we thank you for this Memorial occasion we thank you for your Apostle that's guiding and leading us we surely say we have true leadership in our church [Applause] [Music] princess the Lord in let me give you all the glory of Lord and we won't forget to give you the praise the honor and the glory for great things that was done may your bless us father in Jesus name amen amen you can just greet one another [Music] [Music] amen you may be seated we thank God for these two weekends that we've had with the mothers in the daughters and by coincidence the trusses wanted this weekend for the fathers and the sons and the fathers and the sons has been here did you just have a good time [Applause] it's so ironic that tomorrow's Father's Day and the fathers could be with their little ones enjoying things around God Amen what we would like to sow to you to this morning is the two core building blocks of what we believe and what we believe is what you should know and what you should teach your son what else what else Tabernacle in the message of the hour is all about and to say how to put it into the world and what I'm going to sow to you from God's apostle you'll be able to get the pamphlet of it and you'll go through it so that you can relate to it be able to tell your child about it and when your child faces the world and they know what to answer on what we believe and you might say I have a clue what it is but it's good to put it in the world and know what is our belief system everybody has a belief system out there and when you approach them they give it to you this is it and they give you the scriptures and this is what we want to do and the first thing that we'll start off with is the life story of a prophet William Mary and Brenham and you need to know everything about him because you're in the message of the hour and the name of his father was if somebody must ask you what was his father's name you can turn around and say his father's name was Charles Branham because you're in the the message of the hour you ought to know who brother Brian's father was amen who knew that or didn't know that amen it's quite a lot of new people in the church and we need to give you this so that you can go through it so that you can know how to answer amen and the name of his mother does anybody know that if you don't know put up your hand see a lot of yous don't know amen mother's name was Ella Branham the place of birth was Boxville Kentucky in the United States in bucks for Kentucky in the United States I don't know about the Doma knew that but that's actually where he was born amen amen the Apostle we we need to have the answer because we believe that God sent a messenger in this hour amen he was born in a log cabin and his grandmother was the midwife you didn't know that so this is the core things of what God did through the man that he sent amen his grandmother was the middle wife when he was born his mother says The Light Came whirling in and hung over his bed and when his father opened and his father opened the door to the cabin so there was something Supernatural at his birth and he was born in a lock cabin a wooden cabin amen so that was how the prophet of God arrived and that's where he was born then the question comes in when somebody asks you why a prophet why a prophet why do you say why a prophet the scripture goes on and you will have it on the spam flute I don't know if you have it already it says here be all out saying to Elijah the prophet he doesn't say I'll send you Elijah but he'll send you Elijah the prophet that's why it's a prophet because the Bible says I'll send you Elijah and he'll be a prophet before the great and Dreadful day of the Lord so just before that Dreadful day of the Lord that's why we believe he's a prophet he wants to say program is a prophet the Bible says you'll be a prophet and that's why we need to know this and that's why you need to teach your child and tell everybody that's why God sent a prophet and he will turn the hearts of the fathers to the children and the hearts of the children to their fathers lest I come and smite the Earth with the curse Revelation stands seven why a prophet and in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished as he has declared to his servants the prophets that's why we say it's a prophet because he will Revelation stances he will reveal it to his servant and that's why we say this was our Prophet do you believe he was our prophet but on here we are told in Amos 3 7 surely the Lord will do nothing God will do nothing but revealeth his secret to his servants the prophets so in this hour God would have done nothing unless he sent us Malachi 4 that's why we say Prophet because he will do nothing unless he reveals it to his servants the prophet as he revealed it God promised that before he destroys the Earth he will send Elijah the prophet as per Malachi form so before he destroys the world he'll send an answer before he destroys it thus Prophet will be the seventh church as Messenger to the leotician church age he was sent to reveal the misery of God then seven Revelations tell you and it says here in Amos 3 7 God cannot do anything without revealing his secrets to his prophet so when you're out there you're the university wherever this is why we say prophet that's why we believe in the message of the hour because it's Bible amen as it was in the days of Noah so shall it be at the end time when the son of man shall be revealed that's what Jesus is it will be the same and if this is the days of Noah it is exactly what has taken place and that's what we need to know as young people as new converts as old people and to let our sons and our daughters be indoctrinated with what our core doctrines and why we say that amen in Matthew 17 10 down to 13 the disciples acquired of Elijah should still come Jesus affirmed that he has already come a lot of people believe he's still coming but we can surely say he has already come and they knew him not but surely he will come again to restore all things but the brother by Jesus is they knew they didn't know the first that Elijah John and he will surely come again and if I didn't know that one they will know this one and he will restore all things and we know that the spirit of the Prophet Elijah manifested five times according to the scripture so it manifests that five times that's why it's a prophet because God manifested it five times Elijah the prophet who could shut heavens and it reigned not open it again so it could rain Elisha who received the double portion of Elisha's spirit John the Baptist the third Elijah one that came and they knew him not as Jesus responds to his disciples then Elijah I mean William Branham one that Jesus referred to must restore all things before the Dreadful day of the Lord did this happen do you know why he came because it was said he is going to do these things so God's supposedly showing us we are in the word of God and we ought to know these things as preachers we ought to know we don't just say the prophet said it was in the Bible to say that these things will happen and it has already happened but we need to let our children and these young converts know why we say these things thank you and we got to tell our children our sons and our daughters this is why we come to El Tabernacle it's not just because we believe it's why we believe this because God said so then Elijah will return with Moses to preach to Israel during the tribulation period we should let them know the Elijah will come back after we go he'll be back here so Elijah will come how many times sorry okay so you still what what what we are trying to say here to you today he will come five times God said no Prophet to reveal the miseries of God call out a bride from the church as it happened God's Prophet is God's mouthpiece and as it was in the days of Noah this Prophet was sent to warn people before the oncoming judgment warning before judgment that's why it's a prophet and we need to know why a prophet amen let's give the Lord another hand amen do you love your son and does the son love the father and if you do make sure they know why they are and this is what we're trying to show why we believe things amen then the next thing that we want to lay down for you people this morning it's the life story of the Lord Jesus Christ do you know this man Jesus king God I don't know do you know do you know him if you're in El Tabernacle you ought to know him and you ought to know his life story and why and who he is and we also need to know the date of birth when he was born so when the they come and they ask you when was Jesus born you need it to know when he was born when was he born amen amen we agree we agree with you young men in a way to agree but why we have this is to show those young men when he was born and God has got leadership to tell us in this setting that each one must be on the same page to know in the Bible why he was born and when he was born Jesus was the Lamb of God and he was born in Bethlehem did you know he was born in Bethlehem Lambs were born between late March and mid-april so he was born between late March and the beginning of end of April according to the word of God can you say Amen to them [Applause] he was the son of God Joseph assumed fatherly duties being espoused to Mary so Joseph was not his father he took on fatherly duties but the Holy Ghost was his father amen thank you so if you are faced with this question or your son Faith you can teach him this is what we believe based on the word of God amen the name of his mother was Mary and she found favor in the sight of God and was given was a virgin when she was found with child of the Holy Ghost In accordance to the scripture Isaiah 7 14. and he says Behold a virgin shall conceive bear a son and shall be called his name Emmanuel he was born and of the Holy Ghost she was a virgin and Joseph just took on the fatherly duties because he was espoused but his father was amen the place of birth was bethelium of Judea about 10 kilometers from Jerusalem he was born in a manger because there was no place for Mary and Joseph at the Inn measures are normally found in a stable which is perfect manges I am normally in a stable befitting a lamb and the Lamb of God foreign and when he was born there was also a light a star appeared amen then the question comes from why Jesus why not Muhammad why not anything else the Bible says yo Matthew 1 23 says his name Shall be Called Emmanuel which being interpreted God that's why we need him because he is with us the Emmanuel why Jesus [Applause] he was God in flesh in order to redeem his children God came down himself and was manifested in flesh that's why we needed him God himself was manifested in thank you that's why Jesus can you say it after me God himself was manifested in flesh but why was he manifested in flesh why why to redeem us are you redeemed that proves that God was in are you redeemed that proves that God was in why Jesus the Redemptive work God became flesh he took on our sins where no one was found worthy and died on the cross he became sin so that we can become the righteousness of God second Corinthians 5 11 who has no sin but who took our sins away that's why we need Jesus thank you First Corinthians 15 3 2 verse forces for I have delivered unto you first of all which I have received how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures and he was buried and he rose again the third day according to the so the scripture said he will die and Rise Again and it happened just like that that's why is Jesus King God why Jesus why Jesus because it's Bible and it's fulfilled Acts 2 36 says therefore let all the house of Israel Noah surely that God has made that same Jesus whom we have crucified both Lord and Christ that's saying Jesus whom you have crucified is both Lord and Christ there they have the revelation of the name of the Father the Son and the Holy Ghost but the scripture says the son is both Lord and Christ so in other words the name shows that he was God in flesh he was Jesus Christ he's Lord and that's why we believe in Jesus that's why we say Jesus king why is he King God because God made him both Lord and he is the Emmanuel which means Philippians 2 10 and 11 says that by the name of Jesus every knee by the name of Jesus every knee shall bow every tongue shall confess that Jesus Christ is now do we shout Jesus king God because he is Lord [Applause] can you say Amen [Music] [Applause] Revelations 5 John wept because no man was found worthy to open the book of redemption and no one and but one of the elders told him not to weep because the lion of the tribe of Judah the root of David have prevailed to open the book but when he looked he saw a lamb as it has been slain having seven horns seven eyes which are the seven spirits of God sent forth into the Earth that's why it is Jesus that's why it is King and that's why he is Lord when you look at him when John saw him he had seven eyes seven horns seven spirits of God manifested as why he is Lord amen in this day the Lord himself shall descend in this day because he is Lord he shall descend with a shout with a voice and with a trumpet The Messengers were the lamb before the foundation of the world when he was slain the seven eyes the seven spirits of God sent into the Earth The Messengers have they come were they here so why Jesus it's God in flesh as the musicians play before the man of God come why Jesus according to what the Apostle wants his son to understand he was born of a Virgin Mary and Joseph the assumed the parental duties but this was conceived of the Holy Ghost where was he born in Bethlehem because the Bible says he will come out of so that's why we say we don't say he is Lord or that because the word of God says he'll be those things and he is Emmanuel God worth us so does do you understand young man do you know now when was Jesus born between March and April because that's the time when Lambs are born [Music] let us stand to our feet keep this for reference until you know I'll go why we say do you appreciate the man of God because we ask him to come and address US Grace for us this morning amen [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] thank you [Music] [Music] [Applause] all right now oh my thank you you made me see that amen I was not supposed to be yeah I started recuperating and I just forced myself to to be here and that's why I'm here I try to save myself for the combined and uh I want to be really over this thing I think is about three or four years ago when I was struck with covet in bloemfontein is exactly the same time he came and visit me again and then I had quite a fight to get over it and um but I feel much better I have two weeks to go to a combined so um I need to try and get as much rest as I can so um I'm so happy for um these meetings that we had special house wake and now this week to give you the doctrine I'm a noun you heard such a lot from outside that we don't believe in a prophet and we don't even mention his name and we don't I think we even quote the prophet more than anybody else but we also realize that the young people is not indoctrinated with a doctrine that we believe in and we failed to sow it back and so that you can say it over and over and over again to your family imagine the Jews there's some core values that they are sowing back every day for more than five thousand years the same thing those children hear it every time now if you watch How I pulled it up I brought out what we believe is first before Jesus you know and just to clear the thing up people might think how could you put brother Branham in front of Jesus and I'd done that purposely because nobody will ever know Jesus unless you know brother Brennan and um that's why we wanted to lay down the whole history of the man that showed us Jesus now we are word oriented Church and now automatically you ask the question why and where is the word for that the word for that is in Matthew 3. where John the Baptist which is Elijah said behold the lamb nobody knew the land nobody knew Jesus but Elijah did and he pointed out Jesus [Applause] so none of us here know Jesus and you would have never known Jesus if God didn't send Malachi 4. [Applause] and he told us yeah let's look away to Jesus how can you look away to Jesus if you don't know him so he didn't only had to show us but he had to point him out and he pointed him out and that that makes us the only people on the Earth [Music] that knows Jesus [Applause] and that also makes us the only people that calls him Jesus can't hear you I can't hear you the only people that say that it's quite strange that he always want somebody to point him out thank you [Applause] and that's why we bring out brother branham's a life story and the man called Jesus King God that's our Doctrine [Applause] brother CJ told us that he brought a woman and a three children from polokwane to joburg in the time of Ramadan and he saw the kids about two o'clock that they were really lame and and they look as if they're gonna pass out so he pulled up at the shop he says ma'am I see your children is hungry I'll just run in and buy them something and we can go she says you don't do that and he says why she says I'm a Muslim but to buy food he says yes it's Ramadan they must know too fast they'll eat tonight when it comes to this [Applause] when it comes to this you put on your feet and you feel the difference if it's fast they have to fast they need to be indoctrinated the thing is going to be drawn into them if it's Tuesday [Applause] they need to know it's Tuesday there's no eating they need to be brainwashed in what we believe if if if the Jews and Muslims could be so strict on their belief the Muslims are so strict they even believe in lies anything that the elders told them they believe it you take for instance they're saying that Muhammad went to heaven from the Temple mount and you try to look at history Muhammad was never in Israel but they believe it because they get told that every day when you tell somebody a lie every day they're going to believe that lie and if we tell our children every day the same thing over and over and over and over and over again they will believe it so you cannot compromise on one little thing that we teach in El Tabernacle not one thing [Applause] you need to believe everything that we say yeah well if it's not Bible you don't believe it but if it's hurting yeah only ones you put your life on it believe it with everything in you and how could Jonathan even said why is it the Muhammad or somebody like that Muhammad is not a prophet he's never been a prophet there's not one time Muhammad prophesied to our young people must know who Jesus is because they claim Deuteronomy that God will raise up a prophet and they say that is Muhammad but Muhammad is a not a prophet he never prophesied anything you never said something will come to pass and it came to pass so it's not a prophet so we can't believe in it our children need to know not to believe in it I don't have to grow up not to believe in him I don't have to get so strong in their faith and say Jesus Christ is that prophet of Deuteronomy foreign ought to know that Muhammad married an old woman you wanted to taste our old woman taste and when she died he married and slept with a nine-year-old now which prophet ever slept with the baby made his wife but there's a Doctrine they believe in the Quran says that every Muslim can marry Four Women but he had ate so we need reality and we got reality because of our foundation is built on the prophet and the apostles so we can't go wrong because we know we're right amen that's why we told the sisters when that baby is born the minute that baby is born you take a or you take him he always been his ear and you whisper my child remember Jesus is King God my child remember God sent a prophet my child remember God sent the Holy Ghost in E El Tabernacle [Applause] foreign [Applause] so that goes to say brother William the first thing that God hears and that boy or girl years when they enter into this realm is God first thing the ear here now why why the ear because the ear is the first organ that develops while at babies in the stomach she already knows her mother's voice and then when Mom talk into the ear there that is already developed long ago and it catches the the the words from Mom and the words is another dimension God how can a child go wrong and the last thing that shuts off they say the last thing that shuts off when you die is your ear because when somebody is in a coma and you speak they can hear you although they're in a coma because the ear is active so that's the reason it's a must for you to talk into their ear oh and therefore brethren it's good to repeat things I got one problem I preach never the same thing but a good preach is a preacher that repeats things because God keeps on repeating remember remember he'll tell you he repeats himself all the time because we have to forget and we need to remind our children around the table at suppertime remind them about the doctrine remind them about King Jesus remind them about the miracle that has happened to you and then when you finish you bless your wife and you'll bless your children because that's what we don't do we have to do it every time God bless my wife God bless my children brethren this weekend might seem simple but God is hidden in simplicity you know it's such a good thing once in a while just to break away from a wife and children to be a little alone with him like this weekend [Applause] you ought to have a time of your life because you went away from the hustle and the bustle of brethren to be with him who loves your soul so very much [Applause] he has overcome everything he cried victory over everything [Music] he walked over every evil spirit and you know what as I'm closing he could have called Ten Thousand Angels that Saturday the Saturday [Applause] oh I'm sure that wormwood wanted to come with him I'm sure Gabriel was already I'm sure you real was ready I'm very very very very very sure that Raphael was ready to go with him I'm sure 10 000 Legions of angels was ready to join him [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] but you know what [Applause] he remembered his own words in Matthew 24. he says hell was made for the devil and his angels it wasn't made for Heavenly angels and it wasn't made for you and then he said I'm not going to go down there with my bride my bride hell is not made for you he says I'll go down this Saturday alone a one-man invasion [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] it just shows you if anybody goes to hell he goes alone you won't have the brothers with him the rich and ruler said can you just won my brethren not to come to this place he was alone hell is a lonely place [Music] you go there alone [Music] but the funniest part of it all funniest part of it all heaven we go as a group for together we'll meet the Lord in the air and so shall we be with God God bless her [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] oh foreign [Applause] foreign foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Applause]
