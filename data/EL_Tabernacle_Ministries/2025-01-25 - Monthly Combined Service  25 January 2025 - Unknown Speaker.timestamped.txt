[1:47:42] she asked
[1:47:44] forgiveness and
[1:47:47] um she says well she didn't do anything
[1:47:50] else because all the time time she just
[1:47:53] wanted to serve

[1:47:59] uh I said
[1:48:02] well if they're not

[1:48:09] separated and they live like single
[1:48:13] people by all means it's
[1:48:16] fine they could come serve God
[1:48:29] so
[1:48:31] um we uh also laid down a few things
[1:48:35] that U they have to
[1:48:37] do that's why I took a little time for
[1:48:41] to make the announcement
[1:48:43] here so
[1:48:48] um IO to God
[1:48:52] that God would look down on
[1:48:55] them and show
[1:48:58] Mercy
[1:49:09] amen and then
[1:49:13] I I need to tell you this
[1:49:17] one a certain brother by the name of
[1:49:19] brother Benny I think Edwards that
[1:49:22] Indian
[1:49:23] brother that came from Newcastle and he
[1:49:26] came and served God here and he left
[1:49:29] here and he went to branky and I don't
[1:49:31] know he left there where the deacy is
[1:49:35] now I don't
[1:49:36] know but apparently he said he was
[1:49:39] praying and God spoke to his heart and
[1:49:41] he spoke in
[1:49:43] tongues and the interpretation was a
[1:49:48] message to brother Rosal
[1:49:53] and uh he found Charlton is Charlton
[1:50:00] here Charlton right at the back
[1:50:02] there and he told Charlton to hand over
[1:50:06] the message to
[1:50:08] me and the message was
[1:50:12] uh through
[1:50:15] tongues and the message was in three
[1:50:20] parts one I must give
[1:50:25] over L Tabernacle to
[1:50:31] Jonathan
[1:50:34] two I must
[1:50:36] get my house in
[1:50:40] order and
[1:50:44] three I must present I must
[1:50:49] repent and God will show me of what
[1:50:59] so I've listened send him a message
[1:51:04] back and
[1:51:08] um I just felt
[1:51:11] that this
[1:51:13] God that has spoken to
[1:51:16] him it's a bit mixed up
[1:51:19] [Applause]
[1:51:38] um
[1:51:41] maybe maybe you heard from hery Krishna
[1:51:47] [Applause]
[1:51:55] now why I say
[1:52:00] so is that I let him know and he was in
[1:52:04] the church he knows
[1:52:05] it I think 20 years
[1:52:09] ago I then did handle the church over to
[1:52:13] Jonathan who's the head pastor of el
[1:52:30] Jonathan is running the church the
[1:52:32] Deacon
[1:52:33] board the trustey board the
[1:52:37] ministers the
[1:52:40] Bings for 20
[1:52:44] years now you want to tell me my God
[1:52:47] don't know that
[1:52:53] [Applause]
[1:53:05] Point number
[1:53:08] two get your house in
[1:53:11] order well the thing is is that if it
[1:53:14] means my natural
[1:53:16] house there's only one in that house
[1:53:19] that's me
[1:53:24] you want to tell me God don't know
[1:53:27] that now what house must I get in
[1:53:32] order if it means I must get myself in
[1:53:39] order that entails when brother brandham
[1:53:42] and them speak about it that my time is
[1:53:46] up I'm busy
[1:53:50] living that one I welcome
[1:53:55] because I've been struggling in this
[1:53:57] poopit for 59
[1:54:01] years and I worked because I want to get
[1:54:04] in there
[1:54:06] [Applause]
[1:54:23] number
[1:54:24] three
[1:54:27] is I must repent God will show me of
[1:54:33] what now again I don't understand this
[1:54:37] God I'm busy with my God every
[1:54:41] morning between 2: and 4: every morning
[1:55:13] between two and
[1:55:16] four I plead my
[1:55:20] case I beg him
[1:55:26] I think Denny still sleeps and snores
[1:55:29] that
[1:55:30] time when I'm busy with
[1:55:33] [Applause]
[1:55:39] him since a young man I never
[1:55:43] ever stopped praying at that
[1:55:46] time up till now
[1:55:55] so of what must I Repent when I Repent
[1:55:59] every morning for Thought word and
[1:56:02] deed and I ask God for your repentance
[1:56:05] and to forgive you
[1:56:12] Al every morning
[1:56:21] [Applause]
[1:56:25] now say for instance I had
[1:56:28] something and I asked God for
[1:56:30] forgiveness every morning you'll forgive
[1:56:34] me isn't that making my house in order
[1:56:39] or how do you get your house in order by
[1:56:50] repenting now
[1:56:56] I can't understand how funny this God
[1:56:59] is when he came to David he told David
[1:57:02] he
[1:57:04] son when he came to Moses he told Moses
[1:57:07] he
[1:57:08] son wherever he went he tell the people
[1:57:11] what they sinned but when it comes to
[1:57:14] Edgar Osco you don't tell me what's my
[1:57:17] son
[1:57:26] so I say this and not to be
[1:57:30] funny let his hery Krishna God go to
[1:57:45] hell and I cannot
[1:57:48] understand why can God speak to you know
[1:57:52] when I was in India they call guys like
[1:57:54] that num
[1:57:57] poop talk to a guy like that but he
[1:58:00] speak to me 59 years for 59 years he
[1:58:04] spoke to
[1:58:06] [Music]
[1:58:14] me can you see what I go through church
[1:58:18] [Music]
[1:58:24] now I see the
[1:58:27] colonell on Thursday I don't see him yet
[1:58:31] tonight

[1:58:38] him to check all the Rosco's phones if
[1:58:42] it's
[1:58:43] not hacked that's a word
[1:58:47] right and uh because I feel something
[1:58:50] funny

[1:59:32] they can trace the
[1:59:35] people and uh the thing is this that um
[1:59:40] what

[2:40:19] in
[2:40:21] English and that marks the papers of
[2:40:24] the grade
[2:40:27] 12 for the
[2:40:31] Department not like me and brother

[2:40:42] but I'm going to ask her because she's
[2:40:45] now like the authority on English as far
[2:40:47] as the department is
[2:40:51] let us hear from
[2:40:55] her
[2:40:59] okay bless
[2:41:01] you
[2:41:06] amen I'm going to
[2:41:08] put the scripture on the
[2:41:12] board and he crowd with a loud
[2:41:15] voice as when a lion roar it and when he
[2:41:19] had cried seven
[2:41:20] Thunders
[2:41:22] utter their
[2:41:25] voices now I just want her to
[2:41:28] explain that three words there utter
[2:41:32] there and
[2:41:34] voices I want to go and
[2:41:41] sit and I
[2:41:43] hope elado Park Assembly
[2:41:47] listens because you're following a lie
[2:41:50] in
[2:41:52] Alor good evening Al
[2:41:56] Tabernacle I think you are going to be
[2:41:59] my biggest class I've ever taught so
[2:42:01] here we go let's
[2:42:03] English so to utter means to speak say
[2:42:09] or Express something aloud often in
[2:42:13] words so take note they're not sounds
[2:42:17] they are sounds that are articulated in
[2:42:21] meaning so if an animal makes a sound
[2:42:24] you can't interpret it as a human being
[2:42:26] animals understand animals but when you
[2:42:30] utter as a person it comes across in
[2:42:33] words and therefore
[2:42:43] meaning the word there so we're not
[2:42:47] talking about the place t h e r e it's t
[2:42:51] h i e um e i r is a possessive pronoun
[2:42:58] now take note pronouns are used for
[2:43:01] people so if you want to say uh if you
[2:43:04] want to make your sentence um syntax
[2:43:07] correct you won't say the Apostle said
[2:43:10] that the Apostle will take the sermon in
[2:43:13] the apostles Church you say the Apostle
[2:43:16] said that he will take the sermon in his
[2:43:20] church so in this case the word there is
[2:43:24] not for one person but for many
[2:43:31] persons good so
[2:43:35] far
[2:43:37] okay let's go to voice voice is the
[2:43:40] sound produced when air from the lungs
[2:43:44] passes the vocal
[2:43:47] cords causing them to
[2:43:49] vibrate and it is shaped by the throat
[2:43:52] the tongue and the mouth into speech or
[2:43:57] song so if we pause there a moment take
[2:44:00] note that when the sound comes through
[2:44:03] your vocal cords so vocal chords in this
[2:44:07] case remember produces the sound so
[2:44:11] there's a difference between human sound
[2:44:14] and animal sound because although a
[2:44:18] whale makes a sound
[2:44:20] and can articulate meaning to another
[2:44:23] well you as a human won't understand it
[2:44:27] but now humans on the other hand have
[2:44:30] vocal chords they produce sound that
[2:44:34] articulate words and expression for
[2:44:39] meaning so in order for you to
[2:44:42] understand what the Apostle is
[2:44:45] saying he must produce the sound
[2:44:49] from his vocal cords through his mouth
[2:44:53] and then you will understand exactly
[2:44:56] what is happening in his mind and in his
[2:45:07] heart so let's just tie it to the
[2:45:09] scripture and please I'm not a preacher
[2:45:11] I'm only a
[2:45:13] teacher so here we go the seven Thunders
[2:45:18] had to utter words that carried meaning
[2:45:21] as indicated by the fact that what was
[2:45:24] said could have been written down so if
[2:45:27] you're going to the next verse in verse
[2:45:30] 4 that angel would not have been able to
[2:45:33] write anything or record anything if it
[2:45:36] wasn't words if it wasn't
[2:45:46] meaning so in essence that angel would
[2:45:49] have had nothing to record and we would
[2:45:51] not have been able to hear what comes
[2:45:54] from this gift over the
[2:45:57] [Applause]
[2:46:01] pulpit so let's link it back to the
[2:46:04] humans right because the argument is
[2:46:08] that the virtues are the Thunders and it
[2:46:11] can't be
[2:46:13] because a virtue is not a physical body
[2:46:18] a phys physical body carries vocal cords
[2:46:22] it needs to be within a human form and a
[2:46:26] virtue is not a human form it cannot
[2:46:29] articulate meaning it cannot carry or
[2:46:33] produce meaningful words in any way so I
[2:46:36] think the Apostle's view his standpoint
[2:46:40] his his anchor what is trying to bring
[2:46:43] across is that it is just not true it is
[2:46:47] fallible from the start thank you good
[2:46:55] good rala
[2:46:58] 10:4
[2:46:59] now how could God use three words that
[2:47:04] actually refers to human
[2:47:07] beings they say if
[2:47:10] somebody
[2:47:12] actually come back on anything repeat
[2:47:16] anything then he actually he tells you
[2:47:21] watch but now he does it three times and
[2:47:24] show three times it's human
[2:47:29] [Applause]
[2:47:32] beings
[2:47:35] right then how can we be wrong when the
[2:47:39] Bible says it's human
[2:47:40] beings I don't care about elado Park I
[2:47:44] don't care about de Gloria I worry about
[2:47:47] the word of God
[2:47:58] go
[2:48:00] oh this will be nice in a
[2:48:03] court when if we go to court with a
[2:48:05] thing like
[2:48:06] this and they come with virtues the
[2:48:08] judge is going to shake his head man
[2:48:11] he's never going to agree with them he's
[2:48:13] going to agree Hallelujah with the truth
[2:48:16] amen
[2:48:19] seventh under seven virtues is
[2:48:27] garbage that's why when their founder
[2:48:31] died they said he's coming back with
[2:48:33] blue eyes
[2:48:39] [Applause]
[2:48:41] garbage now there you have it you know a
[2:48:44] nutshell now Sister
[2:48:47] Shanti that last verse also refers so
[2:48:51] clearly and
[2:48:53] plainly seal
[2:48:55] up those
[2:48:57] things which the seven
[2:49:02] Thunders so the seven Thunders uttered
[2:49:05] it which means it was spoken
[2:49:12] aloud it was spoken aloud
[2:49:19] so capital S
[2:49:24] seal so all seven was the
[2:49:27] seals that's what of the BAM says that
[2:49:30] there's a
[2:49:31] [Applause]
[2:49:38] scripture thank
[2:49:42] you we have the truth
[2:49:45] man and the Seven Thunders is our doct
[2:49:50] and the right
[2:49:53] Doctrine because the Bible said
[2:49:55] [Applause]
[2:50:00] so and that's the good news the good
[2:50:03] news the seven Thunders are banging
[2:50:07] [Applause]
[2:50:11] [Music]
[2:50:12] [Applause]

[2:50:43] seven Thunder Seven Virtues after
[2:50:45] this I tell you he's not going to
[2:50:47] believe it
[2:50:52] because the Bible said
[2:50:54] [Applause]
[2:50:55] [Music]
[2:51:01] so
[2:51:03] okay let's take some
[2:51:06] interpretation
[2:51:08] on the Bible on Revelations 3 where
[2:51:12] Revelations 3 said is the seven
[2:51:15] messenges let's take Bible
[2:51:18] on Revelations

[2:55:35] men human beings and God emphasizes it
[2:55:40] four times in Revelations 10 that it's

[5:01:00] tonight 1 Corinthians
[5:01:04] 11 verse 23
[5:01:12] for I have received of the
[5:01:14] Lord that which also I delivered unto
[5:01:17] you that the Lord Jesus the same night
[5:01:21] in which he was betrayed took
[5:01:23] bread and when he had given thanks he
[5:01:26] break it and said take itat this is my
[5:01:30] body which is broken for you this do in
[5:01:34] remembrance of
[5:01:36] me after the same manner also he took
[5:01:39] the cup when it up saying this cup is
[5:01:42] the New Testament in my blood this do ye
[5:01:46] as of as you drink it in remembrance of
[5:01:48] me for as often as you eat this bread
[5:01:51] and drink this cup of the Lord you do
[5:01:54] show the Lord's dead till he come
[5:01:57] wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread
[5:01:59] and drink this cup of the Lord
[5:02:01] unworthily shall be guilty of the body
[5:02:04] and blood of the Lord but let a man
[5:02:07] examine himself and so let him eat of
[5:02:11] that bread and drink of that cup for he
[5:02:14] that eateth and drinketh
[5:02:16] unworthily eateth and drinketh Damnation
[5:02:19] to himself not Discerning the Lord's
[5:02:22] body for this cause many are weak and
[5:02:25] sickly among you and many sleep for if
[5:02:28] we would judge ourselves we should not

[5:02:36] come
[5:02:38] together unto
[5:02:42] condemnation wherefore my brethren when

[5:02:46] another and if any man hunger let him
[5:02:49] eat at home that you come not together
[5:02:51] unto condemnation and the rest will I
