[Applause] in our most important person on the earth right now. Our apostle at your rust. Let's give him a shout. Let's give him a tough offering. [Music] We like to use the opportunity to [Music] welcome senior pastor, Pastor Jonathan Rosco. Let's give him a wonderful hand. You love our precious muscles. [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] It's very quiet in here. Amen. [Applause] [Music] Heat up here. [Music] [Music] In 1979, the message of the hour was in a graveyard. There was no hallelujah. [Music] There was no Holy Ghost. There was no people shouting on the top of their voices. But I want you to know 1979 came and the message is still trembling today because of 1979. That's why I say it's a bit quiet in here. [Music] The devil knows that 79 the silence was broken and it will never be silent again. Hallelujah. And today, [Music] Satan, right in this moment, it's 79 again. That's why I say it's very quiet in here. It's very quiet in here. After all that singing, after that the morning when the sun came up, Satan, it's 79 [Music] again. When God's house will never be quiet because when the man came around, he broke the silence. The man came around [Music] Hallelujah. If you still waiting for something, just shout. You still confused what where you are, just open your mouth and [Music] [Music] Wherever Jesus [Music] You'll hear a lot of noise. So, I want to greet you all in the name of Jesus Christ. I'm so glad that the apostle invited me to his [Music] birthday. Me, the least of all, he he invited me to be here. And what makes it worse, he asked me to say something. Oh, I feel honored. Out of 8 billion, I made it. [Music] Yeah. Same as [Music] somebody. So from the bottom of my heart, I want to [Music] say to this body that carries the power of God. Happy birthday, man of God. [Applause] [Music] I have a saying to my father every now and then when I look at him when I saw him say when he was 60 when he preached crossing the line he said I'm an old man but now I don't believe he's an old man there's a young man living in this [Music] Morning. Hallelujah. And I keep saying to the apostle, do me a favor, Daddy. Just keep on breathing. When CO came, I said, "Oh, God man, just keep on breathing." And I'm so glad it is here with us today. words runs out when it comes to Apostle Ros. You can't say enough. It doesn't do justice to the work that God has done in our [Music] tabernacle. I just want to read a scripture or two. I don't have much to say. [Music] And the Bible says in Job 42:12, so the Lord blessed the letter of Job more of his blessings than what he began. The letter part of Job was blessed more. And I can see it and I'm a witness of it that the latter part was more blessed than when Job was blessed. So in blessing, God has blessed this man. Are you a witness of the letter? [Music] And just before that, the man that accused him of sin, God told those men, if that man don't pray for you, you're in trouble. And I'm so glad he prayed for all of us and we are not in [Music] trouble. Let's give the Lord a hand of praise. [Music] [Applause] [Music] Oh my my my my. Can I just say something quickly? Paul says, "Ye are all partakers. You are all partakers of my grace." And I am a witness today that today and this Revelation stand series and crossing the line, we are all partakers of God's apostles grace because God gave him grace. We are here. Are you here? I can't hear El tabernacle. [Music] Hallelujah. Grace has come our way. [Music] And we want to say thank you to the Lord. It's quiet all over. The message, the internet, the preaching, the moving of the spirit has gone quiet all over and it's getting quieter. But in El Tabernacle, there's a man [Music] [Applause] Now in the book of Genesis, I'm not going to be long. I pastor Jude will be come after me [Music] today. And while I'm on that point, he asked tomorrow to preach for his father. So, we'll be broadcasting tomorrow cuz it's our father. [Applause] [Music] Amen. Although there's many rostals around, but at least it's our father. [Music] Hallelujah. [Music] Hallelujah. Before I finish up, Pastor Paul made a wish to the man of God. And he said that at the latter time he brother Bam say he'll choose to come to the earth to help God's people. I feel we already helped why why why the god man gave you the greatest thing that any man could give you. The greatest thing in the world he gave to our tabernacle. Can you tell me what is that gift that he gave? So if he has given you the Holy Ghost, you can't give him a greater gift back. You receive the greatest [Music] gift. Hallelujah. And I was thinking in the book of Genesis, there was a man whose name started with a E. He was the seventh from Adam. And it was in the book of Genesis. There was a man whose name started with an E. And the Bible says this man walked with God. [Applause] And when I heard them sing that song, I can't even walk unless he holds my hand. I realized God has another man whose name starts with an E and he walks with God. [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] My father flies pigeons and he can see every bird in the kit at his age without glasses. I can't see who's behind in the church, but those dove eyes still sees better than his son's [Music] [Applause] eyes. And Enoch walked with God and he was not. that I believe in Revelations 10, there's another man with a ear. Revelations 10:8 and he also walks with God. Pray for the man of God. Love him more. Appreciate him more. Do what he says. And like he said, don't follow us. Follow that dove. Happy birthday to you, my father. I really love you. You've been more than a father to me. And thanks for coming every time for my soul. I'm a preacher today because he allowed me to keep his mic. This will never be my mic, but my father allowed me as a preacher to keep his mic. We love you pastor Apostle and we know that we'll understand it in the by and by you. Many a day wanted to leave this church but you are back here this afternoon. There's something in this place that's holding the reigns. May God bless you. Happy birthday daddy. God bless you. Amen. [Music] [Applause] We can do much better than that, church. Thank you, Pastor Jonathan Ross. Let's give him a shout. Hallelujah. While we welcome our precious pastor, Jude Rosco, let's give him a mighty, mighty, mighty hand. [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] We greet each one in the name of the Lord this afternoon. [Applause] God is so good to us that he sent a gift our way in this hour. [Applause] And so what's so nice, he made the 21st of March a holiday so that we could be here this afternoon. [Music] [Music] [Applause] In 1946, on 21st of March, God brought a gift to the [Music] earth to help you and to help me. Amen. And the amazing thing is we are still very happy that God's gift is still with us. Amen. And leading us on. Amen. [Applause] [Music] I told the apostle in the week I met him at Mall of the South by chance. I said I the the fasting day I listened to silence part two. I said even if somebody could have those notes they wouldn't be able to preach it like that. Even if you listen to it and try to copy it, you won't be able to preach it like that. It was meant to come out of one man's lips. [Music] [Applause] Hallelujah. [Applause] Hallelujah. And what's so heavy is the anointing on those messages. [Applause] No matter how you feel when you put it on, devils and demons runs. Amen. [Applause] That's why I say like Pastor John, it's an honor to say [Applause] something at our apostles birthday. You don't know what to say. Words like Pastor John says fails you. There's so many things to say. And uh I think sometimes words doesn't make justice to what has been put in to this ministry. [Applause] And uh I always wondered what my mother meant when she said, "You know, Edgar, me and you, we die with our boots on." Hallelujah. We work until we die. And it was so funny when she was in the accident and thrown out of the car, her shoes still stayed on her feet. She was trying to tell us, "I died with my boots on." Amen. And I want to tell her on the other side, my father still got his boots on. We we don't wish him anything because he already has what we want to wish him for. Amen. [Applause] I just want to read two scriptures. Psalms 90 verse 10. The days of our years are three score and three score years and 10 that 70 is allotted to men. And if by reason of strength they be four score years even they four score years 80 years. The Bible says yet is their strength labor and sorrows. When the apostle reached 70, we thought it will be smooth sailing. But even if him living up till now, it came with labor and it came with sorrows. But I thank God that it's Revelations 10:8. Sweet in your mouth, butter in your belly. But what I like of our apostl, he doesn't care about the bitterness. He concentrates on the sweetness. Amen. And I can say that song is fulfilled in his life. We'll work until Jesus come. We'll work until he comes. The apostle is working. Amen. And we appreciate him for that. Amen. That's why we are here this afternoon to come and celebrate his birthday. [Applause] Amen. That's why I'm nearly there. Zechariah 4:7 says, verse 6 says, "Then he answered and spake unto me, saying, this is the word of the Lord unto Jerubabel, saying, not by might, nor by power, but my spirit, say the Lord of hosts." He never came with might. He never came with power. But this apostle came with the baptism of the Holy Ghost. You don't overcome by power. You don't overcome by might. God says, "Not by power, not by might, but by my my spirit, says the Lord of hosts." [Applause] Amen. And the spirit did come and the Holy Ghost did fall. Hallelujah. Here's the Here's the witnesses. Each flag the Holy Ghost fell in every country. Amen. Over 40 countries the Holy Ghost did come. [Applause] Who art thou, oh great mountain, before Jerubabel? Thou shalt become a plain, and he shall bring forth a headstone thereof with shoutings, crying, grace, grace. Oh hallelujah. I thank God that the headstone came spring grace grace the mercy seat. Amen. For you and for [Applause] me. Grace. Grace already came. But we have double grace. If a man lives after 70, it's grace. If he lives to 75, it's grace. If he lives beyond 75, it's double grace because grace is number five. Five and five. Amen. That's why we thank God that the headstone cried grace, grace to El Tabernacle. [Applause] That's why we say apostle age is simply the number of years that the world has been enjoying you. We have been enjoying you. The world has been enjoying you for 79 years. El tabernacle. Have you been enjoying God's apostle? [Music] [Applause] Amen. You might be enjoying him for 20 years, 30 years, 40 years. But before that some people has been enjoying him for the his young age and all the world has enjoyed him for all these years. Amen. [Applause] Hallelujah. As the CRS leader comes up. Amen. Getting old is like climbing a mountain. Hallelujah. I thank God that this man was climbing permit mountain. [Applause] [Music] Hallelujah. [Applause] The older he got, the higher he climbed, the wiser he became. The higher he climbed, the further he saw. The higher he went up the tower, the further he could see. Amen. Hallelujah. Can you say amen? Y tabernacle. Can you say praise the Lord? Y tabernacle. [Applause] The older he got, he must have got out of breath. The higher he went. [Applause] The higher he went, the slower he might have gone, but as long as he went [Applause] higher. The higher the eagle goes, the further he [Music] sees. At 79, we want to tell the devil, he went higher and he looked further. [Applause] [Music] The higher you go, the better the view is. And we want to say, Apostle, enjoy the view. Apostle, tell us what's going on on the other side. The further you see, Apostle, tell us what's going to happen. the higher you [Music] go. Daddy, we love you. We appreciate you. We thank you for all your labors. We thank you, Lord, for not giving up on us and fighting the fight. [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] The higher you go, Apostle Take us with you. Pull us with you higher and higher. God bless you. Amen. Oh. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Don't you appreciate Pastor Jun Rosco? No, we can do better than that. [Applause] [Music] just for a short while just give him thanks. Thank you Lord. Thank you [Music] Lord. Thank you for our pastor Lord. Thank you for keeping him Lord. Hallelujah. Oh, happy birthday, my apostle. There's a lady, a special lady that we would like to call the granddaughter of the apostle, the daughter of our senior pastor, Jonathan Rosco, Sister Esther. If she can come, let's give her a wonderful warm hand. [Applause] God bless you saints. We are gathered here today to honor a truly special man, a true man of God, a legend. A man, a man known in the heavens and known around this world. On behalf of the Rosco grandchildren, I'm truly honored as your first granddaughter to deliver a speech to our phenomenal grandfather. Today we the grandchildren have hearts full of gratitude for a man who has not only been our grandfather but also our apostle who has been a guiding light and a pillar of strength in our lives. Our grandfather is not just any man. He's a man of God. A true shepherd. A true shepherd who has dedicated his entire life to preaching the gospel, leading his flock and living out the word with unwavering faith and dedication. Through his sermons and his prayers and most importantly his example, he has shown us what it means to walk with God. The Bible says in Proverbs 13:22, "A good man leaveth an inheritance to his children's children." Many measure inheritance in material wealth. But our grandfather has given us something far greater. The inheritance of the Holy Ghost, the good news. He has shown us that the greatest gift a man can pass down is not riches, but a life rooted in Christ. A legacy of faith and the power of the Holy Spirit working within us. Growing up under his influence has been a blessing beyond measure. His wisdom has shaped us. His prayers covered us. His love has given us strength to live each day with God on our side. Whether through a kind word, a firm lesson, or a simple moment of laughter, he has always reminded us that faith in God is not just something we speak about, but something we live by. Grandpa, your life has been a testimony of faithfulness, perseverance, unwavering trust in the Lord. You have taught us that no matter how difficult the journey, God is always in control, you have shown us what it means to serve with humility, love without conditions, and lead with a heart full of grace. Our family is blessed with many cherished testimonies that continue to deepen our faith in this great, glorious ministry. I too have a testimony. after countless persons to a few doctors. It was only through your prayers, grandpa, that opened my womb, leaving doctors confused and amazed, that I suddenly got to [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] see. And for that, I'm so thankful, Grandpa. All as a daily reminder that God can do miracles. [Music] The power of God has moved throughout our lives, each and every one of us in this family, pinpointing to the fact that God truly walks with you, grandpa. And we cannot deny it. [Applause] [Music] On behalf of all your grandchildren, we want to say thank you. Thank you for always thinking of us, your grandchildren. Thank you for this great and glorious ministry you've built. Thank you for building a school, a safe haven that molded us. Thank you for all the praise that is keeping us for your wisdom, for your love and for your and for your spiritual legacy you have given us. All we have is because of you grandpa. We are proud to be your grandchildren and we pray that God continues to bless you with strength, good health, and the joy in the Holy Ghost. The 79th birthday, thank you for everything, Grandpa. No amount of words or actions will truly describe what you mean to us. It's because of you that we can be who we the people we are today. We love you, Grandpa. We salute you. May God bless you abundantly and may you enjoy your special day with love from your grandchildren. God bless. [Music] I know you well, but you can't lie to me with all those spoken words you don't let. I'm not trying to follow you to the end of the world. I'm just trying to leave something behind in the footprints of Jesus in [Music] God. Words have come from man no Bible. Oh, but I can't help thinking that I heard the wrong crowd. When the Holy Ghost is gone, my job will be true. And I'm trying to leave something behind in the foot of Jesus. Oh, the money is free and the holy smoking [Music] [Music] behind in the forest of Jesus. This whole world is a war. We swallow the moon, but we don't know why. the case but we know I'm trying to something of Jesus I believe we are all I've Heat. Heat. of Jesus. Now there is a ten Yeah. Heat. It's so hard to future [Music] ahead. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat.
