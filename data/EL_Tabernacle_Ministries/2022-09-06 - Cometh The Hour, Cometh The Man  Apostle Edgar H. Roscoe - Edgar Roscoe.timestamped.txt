[0:00] [Applause]
[0:12] [Music]
[0:17] okay and I and I love my
[0:20] [Music]
[0:22] work I just I just love this job 36
[0:26] years I'm doing this job and I still
[0:28] love it and if there's another 36 years
[0:32] I don't
[0:34] know amen I just love
[0:38] it this morning I I I sure didn't have
[0:42] much time with this message I I forgot
[0:46] to look at the program and brother Paul
[0:48] phoned me Friday night and then uh uh I
[0:53] had the wedding and what have you so u i
[0:57] um had to jump in quickly and draw this
[1:00] up and um I pray that you pray for me
[1:06] that God would bless it amen amen and uh
[1:09] as you know now that uh these videos
[1:12] goes all over and I cannot take no
[1:15] chances so um I have to make double sure
[1:19] because there might be a soul in stake
[1:21] somewhere and it'll help that soul and
[1:24] uh when I get over there I don't want to
[1:27] be empty-handed you know I want want
[1:30] some souls to my name
[1:31] [Music]
[1:39] amen if I should entitle this message
[1:42] I'd entitle it cometh the hour cometh
[1:46] the
[1:47] man cometh the
[1:49] hour then cometh the
[1:53] man in every
[1:56] hour that God has
[1:58] predestinated for anything to
[2:01] happen you'll have a
[2:04] man to go with
[2:06] it so come at the
[2:09] hour cometh the
[2:12] man and I would like to take my thought
[2:15] from this quotation that I gave you
[2:18] Church Ages page
[2:20] 246 and that's the reason I wrote those
[2:22] scriptures they cried Hosanna hosana
[2:25] because that was the hour and that was
[2:28] the man
[2:34] [Applause]
[2:41] but in the case of
[2:42] Luther God's time was ripe come of the
[2:46] hour for a definite move he says but in
[2:50] the time of Luther the man God's time
[2:54] was right right the
[2:56] hour for a definite move that that would
[3:00] be the beginning of the
[3:03] restoration when the hour came God had
[3:06] the
[3:08] man and God don't work any other
[3:11] way that's the only way God works and he
[3:14] doesn't break his
[3:17] pattern when the hour
[3:19] comes God will have the right man at
[3:21] that hour to do the work that heaven can
[3:25] do
[3:28] only
[3:33] he says in Luther God's got a man then
[3:37] God's time was right for
[3:41] justification so cometh the hour so
[3:43] cometh the man if the hour hour comes
[3:47] then it's automatically God
[3:50] has the
[3:52] man
[3:54] [Music]
[3:55] [Applause]
[3:57] automatically God has the man when the
[3:59] hour
[4:00] comes amen because we can only serve God
[4:04] through a
[4:06] representative there is no other way
[4:08] that you can serve God you have to make
[4:11] sure that you get the
[4:13] representative and that representative
[4:15] is proven by God and that's the only way
[4:18] that we can serve God Amen is by that
[4:23] representative if you do not accept the
[4:26] representative then you do not accept
[4:28] God because that is the
[4:31] ambassador of Heaven to you and when you
[4:35] you don't accept that Ambassador you
[4:38] cannot be saved and I want to say this
[4:41] this morning if God has an ambassador in
[4:44] this hour and that's the only way that
[4:47] God is going to work through God is
[4:49] going to lift up that Ambassador God is
[4:52] going to show everybody that that
[4:55] Ambassador is the right
[4:58] Ambassador because cometh the hour
[5:00] cometh the man amen if the hour is here
[5:04] the man must be there
[5:09] [Applause]
[5:13] Hallelujah because we can only serve God
[5:16] through a
[5:17] representative amen and Jesus said in St
[5:20] John 20:21 he says as the father sent me
[5:24] so send I you amen praise God God did
[5:29] not not only send me Jesus Christ but
[5:32] God send me amen so that I can send you
[5:37] to be an ambassador at the right hour at
[5:40] the right time this is my time now
[5:43] because the father sent me but there's
[5:46] coming a time where the father's going
[5:48] to send you to be ambassadors and
[5:51] workers for the kingdom of God for when
[5:54] the hour comes amen the man cometh to
[5:57] amen you can't have the hour outside of
[6:01] the man if the hour is here the man is
[6:04] here for I send you Hallelujah to preach
[6:08] the gospel and raise the dead amen
[6:12] [Music]
[6:13] [Applause]
[6:26] hallelujah as the father sent me so send
[6:29] I you amen how did the father send him
[6:32] to preach Deliverance Amen to bring the
[6:34] Holy Ghost Terry he in Jerusalem until
[6:38] you endured with power from on high amen
[6:41] and brother Here We Are Tonight today we
[6:43] are in the same same commission that
[6:46] Jesus Christ had because he sent us amen
[6:50] and when you receive us you receive him
[6:53] and when you receive him you receive his
[6:55] kingdom and when you receive his kingdom
[6:57] you receive the Holy Ghost and when you
[6:59] receive the Holy Ghost you receive the
[7:01] comforter and when you receive the
[7:03] comforter you receive the Dove and when
[7:05] you receive the dove amen it leads you
[7:07] into the promise of God
[7:11] [Applause]
[7:27] hallelujah and when God send that man
[7:29] man he is never received he is never
[7:33] never received cometh the hour cometh
[7:36] the man but the man never gets received
[7:39] amen everybody will be against him
[7:41] everybody will speak against him when
[7:44] Jesus Christ came they couldn't receive
[7:47] him amen they call him a wine Bubba they
[7:50] call him a glonous amen they call him a
[7:54] a man that's born out of wedlock amen
[7:56] they didn't like him they call him babab
[7:59] amen the king of the Devils but cometh
[8:02] the hour cometh the man God send him and
[8:05] there's nothing nobody can do amen
[8:10] [Applause]
[8:11] [Music]
[8:12] [Applause]
[8:27] hallelujah they didn't receive him
[8:30] they rejected him they criticized him
[8:33] the Pharisees was against him the
[8:36] churches was against him amen the
[8:39] preachers was against him but God didn't
[8:42] change his mind because they were
[8:45] against him because this was God's
[8:47] Ambassador this was God's representation
[8:51] upon the Earth and God stood with him
[8:54] amen because cometh the hour cometh the
[8:58] man
[9:00] [Applause]

[9:03] [Applause]
[9:11] [Music]
[9:14] [Applause]
[9:15] Hallelujah and if the man is there he's
[9:18] never received why a prophet is not
[9:20] known in his own country Matthew 13
[9:23] verse 57 a prophet is not known in his
[9:26] own country and if God send a Prophet uh
[9:30] and God a prophet is a new testament
[9:32] preacher even in this message they won't
[9:35] receive him because he's not known amen
[9:38] they just look at him and says well
[9:40] that's so and so and that's so and so
[9:42] because he's not accepted if they accept
[9:45] him that churches will be empty if they
[9:48] say that that man has the word of God
[9:50] that churches will be empty so they've
[9:53] got to be against him amen jealousy
[9:55] comes up in them because God gave the
[9:58] man a gift amen and that gift is without
[10:01] doubt amen that that's the hour and
[10:04] that's the man cometh the hour cometh

[10:36] done that to me they will do it to them
[10:39] that I sent to amen and brother I'm so
[10:42] glad that I'm one of the ministers that
[10:45] can say they did it to me but here I
[10:49] stand because cometh the hour cometh the
[10:52] man and there's nothing nobody can do
[10:55] about that God in heaven will back up
[10:58] that man regardless of how many split
[11:01] away from him cometh the hour cometh the

[11:30] [Applause]
[11:39] [Music]
[11:43] if he is accepted then he's not the man
[11:47] if he is accepted then it has broken
[11:50] every scripture amen why because every
[11:55] time God has a man he's rejected
[11:58] everybody that likees likes him that's a
[12:00] bad sign amen it's a bad bad sign if
[12:04] everybody likes that man that's a bad
[12:07] sign that's not the man because right

[12:34] called you look for a man amen that
[12:37] everybody hates uh everybody speaks
[12:40] against everybody loves to love to hate

[12:58] yes
[13:01] [Music]
[13:02] [Applause]

[13:13] persecuted they the prophets which were
[13:15] before them in Matthew 5:12 so
[13:18] persecuted they the prophets amen that
[13:20] was before them they hated the prophets

[13:39] mind and not the church's mind and not
[13:42] that up and Up's mind they speak the
[13:44] mind of God and what God wants

[14:04] 23:29 you build the tombs of the
[14:06] prophets and gares the seul of the
[14:09] righteous not only the prophets but even
[14:13] the righteous not only do they kill the
[14:16] prophets but the righteous that comes
[14:18] behind the prophet and say exactly what
[14:21] the prophet said they like to kill him

[15:16] true signs that he is the man of God
[15:20] Amen when they reject him and criticize
[15:22] him and look fault in him that's a true
[15:24] sign one of the true signs the other
[15:27] sign is amen he always tries to run away

[22:29] [Music]
[22:30] [Applause]
[22:39] many a men many of men came before
[22:42] Luther amen and they started the split
[22:46] from the Roman Catholic church but in
[22:48] Luther the split actually came they only
[22:51] caused the trem but Luther got brought
[22:54] the
[22:55] earthquake
[22:57] amen they were men that preach exactly
[23:00] what Luther preached they stood what
[23:02] Luther stood for but they couldn't bring
[23:04] a Reformation they couldn't bring the
[23:07] split from the Roman Catholic church

[24:27] man
[24:33] [Applause]
[24:38] they split the Roman Catholic Church
[24:40] they broke away from the Roman Catholic
[24:42] church because of Luther God anointed
[24:45] Luther God gave him the power to split
[24:48] the church without them killing him
[24:50] because one of those uh reformers said
[24:53] one day a goose will come that you won't
[24:55] be able to kill and he was prophesying
[24:57] about Luther and when Luther came it was
[25:00] the hour they couldn't kill this go amen
[25:03] they killed everybody else but they
[25:04] couldn't kill him why because cometh the
[25:07] hour cometh the man and not even a pope
[25:10] could get rid of him not even clever man
[25:13] could get rid of him not even teachers
[25:15] could get rid of him because cometh the
[25:17] hour sister Judith cometh the man they
[25:20] can't get rid of him until God is
[25:23] finished with
[25:27] him
[25:33] [Applause]
[25:41] they split away from the Roman Catholic
[25:43] church because there was a new age
[25:45] coming the only time that you can split
[25:48] if there's a new age if there's another
[25:50] messenger if there's another message
[25:53] amen then you can leave the old message
[25:55] and go into the new message but amen
[25:57] between
[25:59] amen 1520 and 1750 in the sad Church age
[26:04] amen while you've been in the sadan
[26:05] church age under the anointing of uh of
[26:08] Martin Luther if you split there you
[26:10] lost you lost amen there's no way you
[26:13] can be saved because that's the move of
[26:16] God Amen there's where God was moving
[26:18] and God wasn't going to move with
[26:20] anybody else but with Luther amen so if
[26:23] you wanted to split from him God cut you
[26:26] off amen because that is the age that is
[26:30] the hour and that is the
[26:32] man you lost if you do
[26:36] [Applause]
[26:40] [Music]
[26:42] that God was busy with justification and
[26:45] nothing else nothing else even if
[26:48] somebody says well I I feel now you got
[26:50] to be Sanctified amen it's not time for
[26:53] sanctification it's time for
[26:55] justification for the just shall live by
[26:58] faith
[27:00] [Applause]
[27:04] Hallelujah that was the new message and
[27:07] there's where God was roaming around
[27:09] especially in this age of Brotherly
[27:11] kindness this age of honey this age of
[27:16] Psalm 133 how good and how pleasant it
[27:20] is for brothers to dwell together this
[27:23] is the age of how pleasant it is for
[27:25] brothers to dwell together how can you
[27:27] split in an age like this when the age
[27:30] is brotherly kindness and you split

[1:01:03] times when I heard that the Pentecostal

[1:01:08] have the word but you don't have the
[1:01:11] spirit it hurt me for years and years
[1:01:15] and as I went right around the world in
[1:01:16] the message I found it to be the truth
[1:01:19] and I'm truthful in front of God I
[1:01:21] cannot lie behind the pulpit I found the
[1:01:24] church is dead dry and sty and all it's
[1:01:27] word word word word word I couldn't say
[1:01:30] it's not so because I do not know
[1:01:32] whether they visited any any church in
[1:01:34] the message and that's the reason they
[1:01:36] came up with it and it hurt me it hurt
[1:01:39] me so very much that I said oh God
[1:01:42] what's going on I know these people is
[1:01:45] talking the truth and I know that your
[1:01:47] Prophet said Lord there must be a
[1:01:49] feeling in itth Amen in uncertain sounds
[1:01:53] there must be a feeling in itth and I
[1:01:55] said oh God I know that the prophet said
[1:01:58] that this message takes us back to the
[1:02:00] Holy Ghost and Lord the only sign that I
[1:02:03] know that I'm in the message if my heart
[1:02:05] is turned back to the Pentecostal
[1:02:08] fathers then I'll only know that I'm in
[1:02:10] the message Lord and brother amen I
[1:02:13] thank God while God knew my heart and I
[1:02:16] was sulking and I was waiting for God
[1:02:19] then came 79 the hour amen and then
[1:02:24] cometh the man hell
[1:02:27] and then cometh the man amen and then
