[0:00] when was the first Jubilee
[0:02] day and when will be the last
[0:08] Jubilee it's strange I never thought
[0:11] about the
[0:13] 70th I was always worried about
[0:17] 1977 and I think the devil
[0:21] put a screen over the 70th Jubilee and
[0:26] he puffed up
[0:28] 1977 so that everybody could look at
[0:33] 1977 and not look at the 7year
[0:38] Jubilee and God told me you don't look
[0:40] at that come back to the 70th Jubilee
[0:44] and the 70th Jubilee will open up
[0:48] 1977 and we open it up last
[0:53] night now you have to have a special
[0:57] gift to be able to see things like this
[1:01] otherwise you don't
[1:06] see and
[1:08] Peter came to him and said Lord how of
[1:11] shall my brother son against
[1:14] me and forgive him till seven times he
[1:19] thought seven
[1:20] times Jesus said unto him I say not unto
[1:24] thee until seven times until 70 times
[1:34] 7 now we read that we know that but
[1:38] where is Jesus showing
[1:44] us how much is 70 * 7 490
[1:50] years so Jesus don't answer him there he
[1:54] answers him in the
[1:58] Jubilee why did he answer him in the
[2:01] Jubilee
[2:02] because in the
[2:05] Jubilee is the end of sin he's going to
[2:10] make the end of
[2:12] sin and the end of sin is
[2:15] forgiveness so forgiveness goes back to
[2:18] the
[2:20] Jubilee right into that
[2:24] 400 90 so he tells his disciple you
[2:30] forgive the guy 490 times then you will
[2:34] be in the
[2:37] Jubilee that's how I forgive them
[2:40] because in the Jubilee the priest is in
[2:44] the holy of holies and there he forgives
[2:48] the whole of Jerusalem right in that
[2:51] 4009 oh my God come on
