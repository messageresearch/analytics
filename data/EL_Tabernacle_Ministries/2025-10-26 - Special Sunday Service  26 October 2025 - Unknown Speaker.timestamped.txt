[37:58] Pastor Nathaniel. Hallelujah.
[38:00] Amen. Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[38:18] Hallelujah.
[38:26] &gt;&gt; I greet you this morning in the
[38:28] beautiful name.
[38:30] &gt;&gt; The name above all every other name
[38:33] Lord Jesus King God.
[38:38] [applause]
[38:39] Just want to greet God's apostle, my
[38:42] father.
[38:47] The best in the world.
[38:50] There's no preacher like this preacher.
[38:53] [cheering]
[38:54] There's no apostle like this apostle.
[38:58] And that's why we sing it from the top
[39:00] of our voices.
[39:04] Hallelujah. I'm blessed.
[39:07] And um after last night, such a
[39:10] supernatural [music] outpouring
[39:15] &gt;&gt; that we can be beneficiaries
[39:21] &gt;&gt; that God loves [music] us so much.
[39:25] &gt;&gt; Like I say,
[39:28] the prophecy is greater than the prophet
[39:32] &gt;&gt; because we're living in the prophecy.
[39:37] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[39:38] &gt;&gt; And all that I can come with this
[39:40] morning is a thankful heart with a song
[39:42] on my lips and a song in my heart
[39:47] after last night.
[39:50] &gt;&gt; I pray that this song may be a blessing
[39:52] to you this morning.
[40:06] Something
[40:09] [snorts] happened
[40:13] and
[40:16] I know

[42:25] blessed savior. [music and singing]

[52:23] here.
[52:25] [music]
[52:30] Heat.
[52:31] [music]
[52:41] [music]
[52:46] Heat.
[52:48] [music]
[52:53] &gt;&gt; [music]
[53:01] &gt;&gt; Let's just give the Lord a shout.
[53:03] [music]
[53:04] Let's just give the Lord a to
[53:08] give the Lord a tahil.
[53:10] Let's just give him praise. [music]
[53:12] Praise. Praise. Is there someone in the
[53:15] house this morning and said, "Lord, I
[53:19] come to worship you. I come to give you
[53:22] honor. I come [music] to give you glory.
[53:26] He's a good God this morning.
[53:34] Oh, hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[53:38] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[53:41] All across South Africa,
[53:43] [music] I wish you could be here right
[53:46] now.
[53:47] I wish you could feel the vibration
[53:50] right now. I wish you could feel the
[53:54] waves of God, the waves of the Holy
[53:58] Ghost, the good news, the gospel
[54:02] trumpet.
[54:05] Is there a trumpet here this morning?
[54:08] Why don't you lift your instrument up
[54:10] this morning? Why don't you lift your
[54:13] voice this morning? Show Satan on whose
[54:17] side you on this morning. [music]
[54:21] Oh, hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[54:24] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. You
[54:28] can do better than [music] that. Al
[54:29] tabernacle.
[54:36] [music]
[54:40] Oh, hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[54:44] It's like a beehive.
[54:47] It's like a beehive. Bloomain is known
[54:51] to be a beehive. Maybe you forgot that
[54:55] we are at the altar of Ed. [music]
[54:58] Maybe you forgot that there is a
[55:00] beehive.
[55:03] Are there any bees making honey this
[55:06] morning?
[55:09] [music]
[55:13] Oh, hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[55:18] [music]
[55:30] You need
[55:33] a God.
[55:35] You need
[55:37] a God
[55:39] to meet
[55:41] the need of the people.
[55:46] You need a God to meet the need of the
[55:52] day. [music]
[55:53] You need a God to meet your financial
[55:58] need. And I got news for you. He's here
[56:02] this morning.
[56:05] He's here this morning.
[56:07] He's here this morning.
[56:21] Oh, hallelujah. Hallelujah. [music]
[56:25] We greet you
[56:27] every brother, every sister,
[56:30] &gt;&gt; those that have come from near and far.
[56:34] You never wasted your petrol money this
[56:36] morning.
[56:39] You already blessed
[56:42] from the minute the ad went out. It
[56:45] already stirred the neighborhood.
[56:48] It already stirred El Tabernacle.
[56:51] We were already blessed
[56:54] before we even stepped into this moment.
[57:02] What are you saying, preacher?
[57:04] We just playing out.
[57:07] We just came to play out what the author
[57:11] had in the script.
[57:18] And there's no demon in hell that can
[57:21] rob a child of God. God already saw you
[57:25] in this meeting. God already saw you in
[57:28] last night's meeting. God already saw
[57:30] you in Friday's meeting. It's already a
[57:33] done deal.
[57:35] [music]
[57:41] Why, preacher, [screaming] why? Before I
[57:44] conceived you, before you were in your
[57:47] mother's womb, I ordained you. I knew
[57:51] you. I loved you. It's the blood cell.
[57:54] It speaks. It speaks, Lord. It speaks.
[58:00] May your blood shall speak this morning
[58:03] to the throne of God. You are Mrs.
[58:06] Jesus.
[58:08] You are a child of God. You are a
[58:12] daughter of God. There's enough power
[58:15] within you to create a world. [music]
[58:20] to create a world
[58:23] and you can go and [music] live on it.
[58:28] Let's give the Lord a shabbat this
[58:29] morning. Let's give the Lord a shabbat
[58:32] this morning. Let's give the Lord a
[58:34] shabbat this morning. Let's give him
[58:36] just a little louder. Just a little
[58:38] louder.
[58:41] [music]
[58:47] Oh, hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[58:53] Forgive me this morning. I'm a very
[58:56] excited preacher [music] this morning.
[59:05] Why?
[59:08] Why
[59:10] can we have that quotation?
[59:15] I just want to round off the weekend.
[59:19] My cousin started with the quote.
[59:22] My Opa punctuated the quote.
[59:43] And so,
[59:45] and so, and so he's a preacher.
[59:51] Is there a preacher here this morning?
[59:57] His father
[59:59] is a preacher.
[1:00:12] And I think the old man can out preach
[1:00:16] the other two. And what a double
[1:00:19] portion. Because the apostle said,
[1:00:22] "Brother Brandham, it's greater than
[1:00:24] what you think. I've got an uncle that's
[1:00:27] a preacher. [music] I've got a cousin
[1:00:29] that's a preacher. We are family of
[1:00:31] preacher.
[1:00:33] &gt;&gt; [music]
[1:00:35] &gt;&gt; It's greater. It's greater than this
[1:00:38] quote. It's fun.
[1:00:43] [music]
[1:00:46] Can you imagine
[1:00:48] if one of you [music] can chase a
[1:00:52] million demons? What about four
[1:00:55] preachers? [music]
[1:01:00] What about a family [music] of
[1:01:02] preachers? House of hell. You in
[1:01:05] trouble.
[1:01:17] El tabernacle.
[1:01:19] El tabernacle.
[1:01:21] El tabernacle.
[1:01:23] I'm not here uplifting my family. No.
[1:01:28] But we can't help
[1:01:30] for what God has put together.
[1:01:36] You can't help that you're the bride of
[1:01:38] Jesus Christ.
[1:01:41] You can't help as
[1:01:45] God knew it's going to be you.
[1:01:48] So no matter what the critic says this
[1:01:51] morning, I'm embracing my destiny.
[1:01:55] I'm a child of God. I'm a daughter of
[1:01:59] God.
[1:02:01] Oh, hallelujah.
[1:02:08] [music]
[1:02:12] I don't think I'm going to finish this
[1:02:14] morning.
[1:02:16] He says it's mighty nice.
[1:02:25] &gt;&gt; [clears throat]
[1:02:27] &gt;&gt; If you got a family like that, a church
[1:02:30] that has a family like that, it's so
[1:02:33] beautiful.
[1:02:36] Are you happy this morning? Have you
[1:02:38] found the family?
[1:02:44] And I think after last night
[1:02:47] without a shadow of doubt, he's the
[1:02:51] greatest preacher, the greatest
[1:02:53] scientist, the greatest of all time.
[1:02:56] He's the goat in my books.
[1:03:00] [cheering]
[1:03:02] &gt;&gt; You can do better than that. El
[1:03:03] tabernacle, do you appreciate God's
[1:03:06] apostle? Do you appreciate God's
[1:03:09] servant?
[1:03:17] Hallelujah.
[1:03:20] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah.
[1:03:24] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. [cheering]
[1:03:30] There's a saying
[1:03:34] in our family.
[1:03:38] We're in the business
[1:03:40] of saving souls,
[1:03:43] but not only that,
[1:03:46] keeping souls safe.
[1:03:57] &gt;&gt; He knows how to take the vessel.
[1:04:03] &gt;&gt; He knows how to pour the oil in.
[1:04:08] He knows every shape and size of every
[1:04:11] vessel.
[1:04:13] He knows this one needs a little bit
[1:04:16] &gt;&gt; and that one needs a lot
[1:04:19] &gt;&gt; because he's the handler of the oil
[1:04:26] and he's the God of the generations
[1:04:30] and he's imparted his knowledge
[1:04:33] to his family
[1:04:36] because Jehovah
[1:04:38] &gt;&gt; is God with his family.
[1:04:55] He knows
[1:04:58] &gt;&gt; that your vessel is the soul
[1:05:03] &gt;&gt; and in the vessel [music]
[1:05:05] is the nature of God. Zoe, the life of
[1:05:08] God,
[1:05:09] &gt;&gt; the oil
[1:05:14] &gt;&gt; [screaming]
[1:05:19] &gt;&gt; He says
[1:05:24] in in Abraham and his [music] seed
[1:05:30] 610460
[1:05:33] &gt;&gt; when you're filled
[1:05:35] &gt;&gt; with the Holy Ghost
[1:05:38] &gt;&gt; it is the person
[1:05:41] &gt;&gt; of the Holy Ghost himself.
[1:05:47] &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost is a greater gift
[1:05:51] than the word.
[1:05:54] You need the person.
[1:05:58] You need a personal pronoun today.
[1:06:02] [cheering]
[1:06:07] on answers maner. We make mistakes
[1:06:12] [cheering]
[1:06:14] el tabernacle.
[1:06:16] If you can just remember one thing today
[1:06:18] that I have said, you ought to thank God
[1:06:22] daily for the gift that's in this
[1:06:24] ministry.
[1:06:26] You ought to wake up every morning
[1:06:29] knowing, like the apostle said, there's
[1:06:31] a God out there.
[1:06:37] &gt;&gt; We are fortunate people this morning.
[1:06:41] &gt;&gt; I wonder, can we bow our heads?
[1:06:45] &gt;&gt; Gracious Lord,
[1:06:47] &gt;&gt; Father,
[1:06:49] &gt;&gt; Lord, I'm beside myself this morning.
[1:06:53] Lord, I pray that you may bless your
[1:06:55] people.
[1:06:57] &gt;&gt; Father, it is your people, Lord.
[1:07:00] &gt;&gt; Lord, we are nothing
[1:07:02] &gt;&gt; unless somebody
[1:07:05] &gt;&gt; died for us.
[1:07:08] &gt;&gt; Somebody loved us, Lord. [cheering]
[1:07:10] Somebody came our way. [screaming]
[1:07:13] &gt;&gt; And Lord, it's because of that samarita.
[1:07:18] Lord, he took us into the inn and he
[1:07:21] covered our wounds with oil.
[1:07:24] And we want to say thank you, Lord, for
[1:07:27] this ministry. Father,
[1:07:29] may you bless everyone that has come.
[1:07:32] &gt;&gt; Lord, may you strengthen your servant
[1:07:34] this day. May you bless him, Father. May
[1:07:38] you make his heart glad, Father.
[1:07:42] Lord, we love him.
[1:07:44] &gt;&gt; We appreciate him, Lord. May you bless
[1:07:47] your word,
[1:07:49] &gt;&gt; Lord. I cannot break it. But father, the
[1:07:53] way you break it,
[1:07:55] &gt;&gt; the language you speak,
[1:07:57] &gt;&gt; Lord, your sheep understands the
[1:07:59] language. Lord,
[1:08:01] may you bless
[1:08:04] our servers this morning. If there be a
[1:08:07] visitor in the camp,
[1:08:10] &gt;&gt; Lord, may their hearts burn within them
[1:08:14] &gt;&gt; to say, "Father, I'm not going to harden
[1:08:18] my heart,
[1:08:19] &gt;&gt; but I'm giving you my heart this
[1:08:21] morning.
[1:08:23] &gt;&gt; I've given you my heart
[1:08:26] &gt;&gt; and we know it's in a good place this
[1:08:28] morning, Lord.
[1:08:30] Come now
[1:08:32] &gt;&gt; and bless us, Father.
[1:08:34] &gt;&gt; In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:08:36] &gt;&gt; Amen and amen.
[1:08:43] &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[1:08:50] &gt;&gt; But the hotter it gets,
[1:08:53] &gt;&gt; the better.
[1:08:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. [cheering]
[1:09:00] I wonder at this moment in time just
[1:09:03] turn to your brother, your sister, say,
[1:09:06] "It's good to be here.
[1:09:08] I love you. I appreciate you." To the
[1:09:11] visitor friend, just go shake someone's
[1:09:14] hand that you don't know. Welcome to the
[1:09:17] service this morning.
[1:09:35] Oh, it's so beautiful.
[1:09:43] Don't be cross this morning. Just just
[1:09:45] turn to that person, you know, and just
[1:09:47] say, "I love you. I appreciate you.
[1:10:02] Amen.
[1:10:05] &gt;&gt; I just I just want to rub it in a
[1:10:07] little, you know. I just want to rub it
[1:10:09] in a little.
[1:10:15] [music]
[1:10:18] want to do something.
[1:10:25] [music]
[1:10:28] You you
[1:10:32] have my two grandsons preaching with me,
[1:10:36] but I would like to just rub it in.
[1:10:39] I got my grandson on their piano.
[1:10:46] my grandson on the piano [music]
[1:10:54] [applause]
[1:10:56] and I have a double portion.
[1:10:59] I have my grandson on the bass guitar.
[1:11:02] Get up there. Give us a strum there.
[1:11:12] [cheering]
[1:11:19] &gt;&gt; [music]
[1:11:22] &gt;&gt; Jealous Tom.
[1:11:24] Jealous Tom
[1:11:27] [cheering]
[1:11:28] [music]
[1:11:30] and the whole family
[1:11:32] in heaven.
[1:11:40] &gt;&gt; Did you ever see a thing like this?
[1:11:44] &gt;&gt; [cheering]
[1:11:46] &gt;&gt; But our tabernacle,
[1:11:48] we have it here. Thank you.
[1:11:53] Let's give God's apostle a hand.
[1:11:57] Let's give Brother Eda a hand. Let's
[1:12:00] give the troll Augustine a hand. [music]
[1:12:04] Let's give the Augustine family a hand.
[1:12:07] Uncle Ariel,
[1:12:09] my cousins, let's give the family a hand
[1:12:12] this morning. [music]
[1:12:16] [cheering]
[1:12:24] &gt;&gt; I just want to also rub it in. Grandpa
[1:12:28] Topella, do you have that picture?
[1:12:36] It's the angel. Let's just give her a
[1:12:38] hand
[1:12:43] [applause]
[1:12:45] now, man. Sir,
[1:12:49] &gt;&gt; it's a family weekend for ons.
[1:12:52] &gt;&gt; So, I'm entitled to bring out the files.
[1:12:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:57] So they won't tell you it, but I
[1:13:00] actually converted all these cousins.
[1:13:04] [cheering]
[1:13:06] &gt;&gt; They were in my meetings.
[1:13:09] Sister Esther,
[1:13:11] [music]
[1:13:12] there's Uriah
[1:13:14] in one of my church services there.
[1:13:18] So I wasn't ordained a preacher. No,
[1:13:23] man.
[1:13:24] I was born
[1:13:27] I was born into royalty.
[1:13:35] I didn't have a choice
[1:13:38] but I was born into it.
[1:13:41] [cheering and applause]
[1:13:44] And there's no pleasure
[1:13:47] better, no golf game, no singing a song
[1:13:52] can [music] compared to doing something
[1:13:54] for God's people.
[1:13:57] It's better
[1:13:59] than being the president
[1:14:02] of a country is to have a preacher.
[1:14:10] Amen, sir.
[1:14:12] Amen, sir. [cheering]
[1:14:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:14:18] If you have your Bibles this morning,
[1:14:22] turn to two portions of scripture.
[1:14:35] So, let's leave Matthew.
[1:14:38] &gt;&gt; Let's leave Luke.
[1:14:41] But let's go to John
[1:14:44] because John speaks plainly.
[1:14:47] John doesn't beat around the bush.
[1:14:50] John will say who the son of God is.
[1:14:54] [cheering and applause]
[1:14:55] John 5
[1:14:58] verse 39 and 40.
[1:15:03] John 5:39 and 40.
[1:15:08] &gt;&gt; Search
[1:15:09] the scriptures.
[1:15:11] &gt;&gt; I invite you this morning.
[1:15:14] &gt;&gt; Visit a friend eel tabernacle.
[1:15:18] &gt;&gt; Search,
[1:15:20] search this Bible.
[1:15:24] For in them
[1:15:26] ye think
[1:15:30] &gt;&gt; in those scriptures
[1:15:32] &gt;&gt; you think that you have eternal life.
[1:15:40] &gt;&gt; And little do you know
[1:15:42] &gt;&gt; they are they
[1:15:45] &gt;&gt; which only testify
[1:15:49] [cheering]
[1:15:49] &gt;&gt; of me.
[1:15:52] &gt;&gt; Jesus.
[1:15:55] You can go and search the scriptures,
[1:15:59] but it's only a testimony
[1:16:02] of the son Beth.
[1:16:06] &gt;&gt; But the problem we make is we think
[1:16:09] that's where the eternal life is.
[1:16:14] &gt;&gt; Amen, sir.
[1:16:18] Amen. Sir,
[1:16:19] &gt;&gt; amen. [cheering]
[1:16:23] and he will not come unto me.
[1:16:27] &gt;&gt; It's so deep this thing.
[1:16:29] &gt;&gt; It's like the apostle said it's the
[1:16:31] saddest line.
[1:16:33] &gt;&gt; Because we find that they majored on the
[1:16:37] testimony of the word
[1:16:39] &gt;&gt; and they thought they've got life.
[1:16:48] And here Jesus
[1:16:51] your God
[1:16:53] says, "Why don't you search the
[1:16:55] scriptures?"
[1:16:56] &gt;&gt; He invites you this morning.
[1:17:04] [cheering]
[1:17:05] &gt;&gt; But he will not come unto me a foolish
[1:17:08] virgin.
[1:17:10] Even in that scripture,
[1:17:12] &gt;&gt; the scripture doesn't do anything
[1:17:15] &gt;&gt; because you can take this book,
[1:17:18] you can buy it at any bookshop,
[1:17:21] you can this is very available
[1:17:24] &gt;&gt; but this can't save me.
[1:17:27] I need
[1:17:32] [cheering]
[1:17:36] &gt;&gt; [music]
[1:17:41] [cheering]
[1:17:42] &gt;&gt; Did you catch it?
[1:17:44] &gt;&gt; Why do I need that? Because I need
[1:17:47] eternal life.
[1:17:50] &gt;&gt; I never came to church to waste my time
[1:17:52] from Joberg on blue day. I don't I don't
[1:17:55] Why must I be here? I came for eternal
[1:17:59] life.
[1:18:00] &gt;&gt; I came for eternal [cheering]
[1:18:08] &gt;&gt; [applause and cheering]
[1:18:12] &gt;&gt; And he's sad because he says he will not
[1:18:15] come
[1:18:16] &gt;&gt; that you might have life.
[1:18:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:18:30] &gt;&gt; But El tabernacle
[1:18:33] I'm like the hymnwriter this morning.
[1:18:36] &gt;&gt; Say, "Here's my vessel.
[1:18:39] &gt;&gt; Here's my cup.
[1:18:42] &gt;&gt; I want you to fill it up.
[1:18:45] Not with the letter,
[1:18:47] not with the script, but with the
[1:18:50] manifestation of that word, which is the
[1:18:54] eternal life of God, which is Zoe."
[1:19:01] Because the letter
[1:19:04] &gt;&gt; but the spirit.
[1:19:06] &gt;&gt; So if the spirit gives life,
[1:19:08] &gt;&gt; why do they major on the letter?
[1:19:18] &gt;&gt; John 6
[1:19:21] verse 60
[1:19:22] &gt;&gt; to 69.
[1:19:27] Many therefore of his disciples
[1:19:30] &gt;&gt; when they heard this said,
[1:19:33] &gt;&gt; "This is a hard saying.
[1:19:36] &gt;&gt; Who can hear it?"
[1:19:38] &gt;&gt; When it comes to his blood,
[1:19:40] &gt;&gt; when it comes to drinking,
[1:19:43] &gt;&gt; when it comes to the flesh,
[1:19:45] &gt;&gt; it's a hard thing.
[1:19:48] [cheering]
[1:19:53] When it comes to communion,
[1:20:01] &gt;&gt; when Jesus knew in himself that the
[1:20:04] disciples murmured at it, he said unto
[1:20:07] them,
[1:20:08] &gt;&gt; "Do this offend you
[1:20:10] &gt;&gt; in El Tabernacle, is it offending you?"
[1:20:15] &gt;&gt; Because this is where the division
[1:20:16] comes.
[1:20:24] Because you need to have so much faith
[1:20:26] in your leader. Because if you don't
[1:20:29] believe in the leader, he will take you
[1:20:32] to your damnation. He will take you to a
[1:20:36] destination you do not want to be.
[1:20:39] &gt;&gt; So you've got to have faith in your
[1:20:41] leader. [cheering]
[1:20:45] &gt;&gt; [screaming]
[1:20:47] &gt;&gt; David was so powerful
[1:20:50] that the congregation
[1:20:52] that the whole of Israel chanted his
[1:20:55] name because they had faith that this
[1:20:58] David slew a Goliath. That means there's
[1:21:02] a God with this little man. There's a
[1:21:05] God in this little body. There's a God
[1:21:07] in this little man. [cheering]
[1:21:10] And this morning we have another
[1:21:12] representation.
[1:21:14] There's a God in a man
[1:21:17] [cheering]
[1:21:20] that has slayed your Goliath
[1:21:22] in your life.
[1:21:26] [cheering]
[1:21:27] And that is why this is a glorious
[1:21:30] church without spot or wrinkle because
[1:21:34] we know who our leader is. [cheering]
[1:21:39] &gt;&gt; You've got to have faith in God's
[1:21:41] servant. How do you do the will of God
[1:21:44] or the works of God? Believe.
[1:21:50] [cheering]
[1:21:52] [screaming]
[1:21:55] &gt;&gt; That's all you have to do this morning.
[1:21:57] You just got to believe in the scent one
[1:22:01] which is an apostolic gift. [cheering]
[1:22:05] [applause]
[1:22:09] Many want to do something for God.
[1:22:11] Many want to walk for God.
[1:22:14] &gt;&gt; But all you've got to do is believe.
[1:22:16] &gt;&gt; That's the requirement.
[1:22:19] &gt;&gt; Then you pass from death unto life
[1:22:20] because it's not your problem. We in the
[1:22:24] business of saving souls. He's the
[1:22:27] handler of the oil. He knows your need.
[1:22:31] Expel your thoughts to your pastor. Your
[1:22:34] pastor will see you through. It's the
[1:22:37] dove leading the eagle. It's the ammoya.
[1:22:47] Don't burden yourself this morning. It's
[1:22:50] too much for you. Give it over and
[1:22:54] believe it.
[1:22:57] If it's of God,
[1:23:00] it will come to pass.
[1:23:04] If it's of God,
[1:23:06] it will manifest itself.
[1:23:09] If it's of God, it's not your business
[1:23:13] to question.
[1:23:15] Just believe, child of God, [music]
[1:23:26] what? And if ye shall see the son of man
[1:23:29] ascend
[1:23:30] up where he was before. Here Jesus asks
[1:23:33] them a question. Maybe if you see me
[1:23:37] &gt;&gt; ascend.
[1:23:39] Maybe that will boost your faith.
[1:23:41] Because as human beings that's what we
[1:23:43] want. We want an angel now
[1:23:46] &gt;&gt; coming down from heaven. We want a quick
[1:23:48] miracle.
[1:23:50] &gt;&gt; We need something to convince us that
[1:23:54] this is it.
[1:23:56] That's human nature.
[1:23:58] &gt;&gt; That's the life you in. But you need an
[1:24:02] eternal life where you pull your
[1:24:04] strength and you say, "I I don't
[1:24:07] understand it, but I believe it this
[1:24:10] morning.
[1:24:12] I don't need you to ascend.
[1:24:14] I don't need you to go up. [screaming]
[1:24:17] You're on the earth now. You're on the
[1:24:20] earth now. Don't go up. Take me with
[1:24:23] you.
[1:24:29] Say hallelujah somebody.
[1:24:32] Say hallelujah. Somebody. We are not
[1:24:35] like the disciples this morning. We
[1:24:37] don't need a quick thing. We believe it.
[1:24:41] We believe it this morning.
[1:24:47] Oh, hallelujah.
[1:24:54] It is the spirit.
[1:24:56] The spirit that quickenth,
[1:25:00] &gt;&gt; it is the spirit.
[1:25:02] &gt;&gt; That quickenth because your body is
[1:25:04] weak. Your body has mistakes. But the
[1:25:08] spirit within you, it revives you week
[1:25:11] in and weak out. It's your power bank.
[1:25:14] [cheering]
[1:25:20] I'm going to leave the others. Let me
[1:25:21] just get to my point.
[1:25:23] Verse 67. Then Jesus said unto the 12,
[1:25:28] "Ye will he
[1:25:30] also go.
[1:25:33] El tabernacle,
[1:25:35] &gt;&gt; will you also go?" [cheering]
[1:25:38] &gt;&gt; This is Jesus this morning asking the
[1:25:41] church, "Will you also go?"
[1:25:46] Then Simon Peter.
[1:25:49] &gt;&gt; Oh.
[1:25:51] Oh.
[1:25:54] &gt;&gt; Oh, I like Peter.
[1:25:56] Oh, he spoke his mind. He wasn't like
[1:25:59] the 12 that was confused. Oh, who's
[1:26:03] living beside me? Peter jumped up. Peter
[1:26:08] jumped up. Peter jumped up. Oh, and he
[1:26:13] looked the Messiah,
[1:26:15] &gt;&gt; the son of the living loving God in the
[1:26:17] eye
[1:26:19] [cheering]
[1:26:19] and he says, "Lord, [screaming]
[1:26:23] Lord,
[1:26:25] Lord,
[1:26:27] to whom shall we go?"
[1:26:35] El tabernacle.
[1:26:38] El tabernacle.
[1:26:40] Where can we go from this?
[1:26:56] It took
[1:26:58] an apostolic answer.
[1:27:02] It took the guy with the keys to the
[1:27:05] Holy Ghost to answer
[1:27:09] &gt;&gt; and say, "Where are we going to go?"
[1:27:13] &gt;&gt; And Peter doesn't stop there.
[1:27:17] &gt;&gt; El tabernacle, I want you to read it.
[1:27:23] &gt;&gt; Thou,
[1:27:27] &gt;&gt; just read it one more time.
[1:27:32] Just one more time.
[1:27:47] &gt;&gt; You need a preacher.
[1:27:49] You need a leader
[1:27:51] &gt;&gt; that's got the word for your day.
[1:27:54] &gt;&gt; You need someone that's got eternal
[1:27:57] life.
[1:27:58] &gt;&gt; [cheering and applause]
[1:28:01] &gt;&gt; May the Lord add a blessing
[1:28:04] &gt;&gt; to the reading of this word.
[1:28:07] [cheering]
[1:28:07] &gt;&gt; May you just hug your brother and your
[1:28:09] sister before you take your seat.
[1:28:23] &gt;&gt; I'm sorry for keeping you so long,
[1:28:27] Grandpa. I'm sorry for letting you stand
[1:28:29] so long,
[1:28:32] but it needs to sink in this morning.
[1:28:36] It needs to go into your theophony this
[1:28:39] morning.
[1:28:41] You need to realize who you are.
[1:28:44] &gt;&gt; You need to realize that you're just not
[1:28:46] by the way.
[1:28:48] &gt;&gt; You need to realize that any church out
[1:28:50] there can't give you eternal life.
[1:28:58] Mike like for Peter man
[1:29:02] &gt;&gt; the others were so confused
[1:29:08] &gt;&gt; and he throws the ball back to Jesus.
[1:29:12] &gt;&gt; It was the greatest tennis match
[1:29:15] &gt;&gt; because Jesus asked the question first.
[1:29:21] &gt;&gt; Are you going to go? [cheering]
[1:29:24] And Peter said, "Where are we going to
[1:29:26] go,
[1:29:28] &gt;&gt; Lord? Where can we go?"
[1:29:31] &gt;&gt; He says, "You've got the words of
[1:29:32] eternal life."
[1:29:34] &gt;&gt; And imagine how Jesus felt. He knew that
[1:29:37] that answer came directly from the
[1:29:41] father above. Because only the father
[1:29:44] can put that desire in your heart to
[1:29:47] know where you come from, to know where
[1:29:50] you going to, to know who's your leader,
[1:29:52] to know who's your representative.
[1:29:58] [cheering]
[1:30:00] &gt;&gt; And visitor friend, we invite you this
[1:30:04] morning.
[1:30:05] &gt;&gt; Where are you going to go? Which church
[1:30:07] are you going to go to this morning that
[1:30:10] can give you the everlasting gospel?
[1:30:13] That can give you eternal life
[1:30:15] abundantly, that can preach the gospel
[1:30:18] without any shortity.
[1:30:24] You need a church. You need a
[1:30:27] representation
[1:30:29] from the throne of God. You need a guide
[1:30:32] that can take you by the hand and show
[1:30:34] you the ABCs and show you what is the
[1:30:37] basics of the Ephesians church age. They
[1:30:40] can show you there will be babies born
[1:30:43] in the millennium. They can show you the
[1:30:45] genetics of God. They can show you how
[1:30:48] the atom was broken. They can show you
[1:30:51] how life formed. They can show you
[1:30:54] creation started.
[1:30:56] [cheering]
[1:30:58] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[1:31:00] &gt;&gt; like a Pentecostal experience without
[1:31:03] beginning and without the end. That is
[1:31:06] what life is this morning. Life is the
[1:31:08] Holy Ghost.
[1:31:09] &gt;&gt; Life is the Amoya. Life is Zoe. The
[1:31:13] goal. [cheering]
[1:31:16] Oh, I'm excited this morning. I'm
[1:31:19] excited this morning. I want to be like
[1:31:21] Peter. I want to say, "Where can I go,
[1:31:25] Lord? Where can I go? You've got the
[1:31:28] words of eternal life. [cheering]
[1:31:36] For a title this morning, [cheering]
[1:31:39] we started the weekend with a question.
[1:31:45] &gt;&gt; Where
[1:31:47] is the God of Elijah?
[1:31:52] [cheering]
[1:31:57] Let's end it with a question. Lord,
[1:32:01] to whom shall we go?
[1:32:04] &gt;&gt; Thou has the words of eternal life.
[1:32:07] &gt;&gt; I want to take that thought this
[1:32:09] morning. And I want to put it in your
[1:32:11] lap this morning. El tabernacle visit a
[1:32:14] friend.
[1:32:16] &gt;&gt; Where can we go
[1:32:18] &gt;&gt; in the hour that we love him? in the
[1:32:21] time that we're living in.
[1:32:23] &gt;&gt; Deuteronomy 30:1 19 says, "I call heaven
[1:32:27] and earth to record this day against
[1:32:30] you."
[1:32:31] &gt;&gt; That I have set before you life.
[1:32:36] &gt;&gt; I have set before you.
[1:32:40] &gt;&gt; And
[1:32:41] &gt;&gt; so the choice is yours this morning. Do
[1:32:44] you want eternal life
[1:32:46] &gt;&gt; or do you want a wordbased doctrine
[1:32:50] that's full of the scriptures that's so
[1:32:52] hard to digest? But when you have a
[1:32:55] ministry, hallelujah, that's got the oil
[1:32:59] to mix the meal and digest the system
[1:33:02] and move down. And when it reaches your
[1:33:05] system, it knows how to go because the
[1:33:08] body is so beautifully made. There's a
[1:33:11] certain amount of oil that your
[1:33:13] spiritual body needs and when it gets
[1:33:16] that [cheering]
[1:33:19] you feel leer in the service brothers
[1:33:22] they can [cheering]
[1:33:26] say word
[1:33:29] [cheering]
[1:33:35] [cheering]
[1:33:37] a blessing and a curse. Therefore,
[1:33:40] choose life
[1:33:42] &gt;&gt; that both thou.
[1:33:48] &gt;&gt; Can you read it for me? that both thou.
[1:33:55] &gt;&gt; So if this family,
[1:33:59] &gt;&gt; if this preaches,
[1:34:02] &gt;&gt; if the old man
[1:34:04] in the quote
[1:34:06] &gt;&gt; didn't choose life,
[1:34:10] &gt;&gt; read that part again at the bottom
[1:34:11] there, that thy
[1:34:15] &gt;&gt; we are alive this morning.
[1:34:18] We came to preach this morning because
[1:34:21] we have a handler of the oil that chose
[1:34:25] eternal life for his family that says,
[1:34:27] "Rosco family, we're going to choose the
[1:34:29] blessing. We're going to choose the
[1:34:31] blessing. We're going to be like Jacob
[1:34:33] this morning. We're going to steal the
[1:34:35] Holy Ghost from every church, from every
[1:34:38] denomination, from every organization.
[1:34:40] And we took the blessing. We took the
[1:34:43] birthright." The apostle ran with the
[1:34:45] stump, the baptism of the Holy Ghost.
[1:34:48] And he says, "This is for my family.
[1:34:51] [cheering]
[1:34:51] &gt;&gt; This is for my church.
[1:34:55] Amen." [cheering]
[1:34:57] [applause]
[1:35:00] &gt;&gt; Years back they told the apostle, "You
[1:35:04] chose the best part.
[1:35:07] &gt;&gt; [cheering]
[1:35:08] &gt;&gt; You took the best part
[1:35:11] &gt;&gt; of the whole lamb
[1:35:14] of the whole [cheering]
[1:35:19] because everything like Pastor Jude said
[1:35:23] is the Holy Ghost.
[1:35:26] [cheering and applause]
[1:35:33] &gt;&gt; [cheering and applause]
[1:35:38] &gt;&gt; In march to the blood, the apostle says,
[1:35:44] "Isn't sin like death?
[1:35:49] Sin sold
[1:35:51] the prince of life
[1:35:55] &gt;&gt; for a mere 30 pieces of silver.
[1:35:59] It will always
[1:36:01] make eternal life cheap.
[1:36:06] &gt;&gt; Sin in your life will always make
[1:36:10] eternal life cheap.
[1:36:16] &gt;&gt; If you are a sinner, don't treat eternal
[1:36:19] life with contempt.
[1:36:23] If you're not, then why are you still
[1:36:27] going on in sin?
[1:36:29] &gt;&gt; A sinner treats eternal life cheap and
[1:36:33] mortal life gets treated with glory.
[1:36:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. Sir,
[1:36:41] &gt;&gt; can I get a amen? [cheering]
[1:36:44] &gt;&gt; It's hard, but it's the truth.
[1:36:46] &gt;&gt; And not only the sinner, but also in our
[1:36:50] in our in our church.
[1:36:52] We treat our car as if it's everything.
[1:36:55] &gt;&gt; We treat our health as if it's
[1:36:57] everything. But we fail to realize that
[1:37:00] we are not here on our own merit. We are
[1:37:04] called our people.
[1:37:06] We are holy priesthood. We are chosen
[1:37:10] nation.
