with the preaching and I can't keep up the way the things are rolling in and that makes me breed such a lot but e Tabernacle it is to your advantage that God gave us this I just like to pray father forgive us our tra passes lead us not into temptation Deliver Us from Evil give us our daily bread Lord not yesterday's bread but today's bread modern events bread father we ask of you that you'll be

without you predestinated it pray that you bless us bless the listeners bless El Tabernacle around South Africa and outside of South Africa in Jesus name amen now I entitled this a little should I say message or whatever the USA a woman's Nation Revelations 13 and I stood upon the sand of the sea and I saw a beast rise up out of the sea having seven heads 10 horns and upon his horns 10 crowns and upon his head the name of bless me and the Beast which I saw was unto a leopard and his F were as his feet was a bear and his mouth as a mouth of a lion and the dragon gave him his power and his seed and great Authority and I saw one of his heads as it it was wounded to death verse four and they worshiped the dragon which gave power upon unto the Beast and they worshiped the Beast saying who is who is like unto the Beast who is also to make war with him and and was given unto him among speaking great things and verse 8 and all that dwell upon the Earth shall worship Him whose names are not written in the Book of Life of the lamb slain before the foundation of the world verse 11 is the thing and I behold another Beast coming up out of the Earth this one not out of the sea out of the earth and he had two horns religious and political like a lamb and he spoke as the dragon and there's where brother brandham says a America is that Beast cuz she is the only Kingdom that comes out of the earth not a population of people in Europe but the new world like they call it then so that's why we read that scripture because brother brandham referred to it and showed us what Revelations 13 is now I want to make it pretty clear don't go and say I said is the end of the world like some said about September 2023 said that I said the world is coming to an end and um but I vividly said on the 70th Jubilee it's God's desire time to come as we worked out the Jubilee the 70th Jubilee which no one in this message knew or understood um understood it we made it plain because we got it in Gabriel 70 weeks we brother B said the 70th Jubilee the Rapture goes so we went to check up the 70th jub and we bought books from all over what we can get and uh we brought you the times and how it worked out and it worked out right onto uh 2024 September will be the 50th Jubilee from 1974 when the 70th Jubilee started and brother Brian spoke of 1977 which we also clarified 1977 and we had the privilege to shut a lot of people's mouths we thank God for these um Revelations that we could prove by the Bible by the message and also by the history about the 70th weeks of Daniel so that is God's desired time to come and we also said when it comes to God's desired time he has the right to lengthen the time or shorten the time you know because as it was in the days of Noah when God waited listen waited waited in his judgment to judge Noah's day in his longsuffering so if God has a longsuffering then we could say that he that is all in his hand but his wish is to come in the 70th Jubilee which we worked it out and showed you 6,000 years is up exactly like six days God created the Heaven and the Earth so um it is no prophecy of mine but also it's a signs of the end time still a time period it must be scriptural and it must be in the quotes and it must be time and it must be God's season then it will happen that's a quote we know Proverbs says there is a time and a season time and a season for every purpose of God a time and a season so could we venture out and say could this Perhaps Perhaps be God's time and season for the sixth Vision to be fulfilled from that time brother Bram says 1960 the 7 month 16th day he says thus saith the Lord in other words God said it not brother Brenham God said it there'll be a woman rule a woman rule before the end time listen here before the end time she'll either be president or vice president or the Roman Catholic Church listen there's three important points in this quote Point number one before the end time why does he say before the end time because the seventh vision is the end time the abor the seventh trumpet Revelations 11:14 the Third Woe cometh quickly it comes quickly after her that's the end remember that so her coming in is not the end of the world get me straight please but the bride is gone then when this happens when the bomb Falls when that woe comes remember the bride is gone before the end of the world in other words she won't see the end of the world the world so brother BR says a woman will rise she'll be he says she'll be president of Vice President well she's running for both she already fulfilled the one she is and was the vice president and now she's running to be a camp candidate for presidency so the quote is running with God's will so far we're going to bring this back again to you her eyes was 1990 Deputy district attorney 2000 courtroom prosecutor San Francisco two uh3 district attorney 2010 generalist attorney 2016 US senator 2020 elected vice president 2024 president candidate isn't this scary straight with the quote anybody can see this could it be El Tabernacle could it be so the court is running with God's will so far from the same quote from that time he says or the Catholic church so here we see distinctly two woman a natural woman that will be voted in and a spiritual woman which is the Roman Catholic Church that's not voted in she just comes in but the natural woman that will be president she gets voted in so I never saw this just the other day and as I went through the quotes and I think there's about 200 or so many quotes or even more uh and or if you read really those quotes you'll see he speaks every time of two wom that's why we have two candidates for the two woman one is Trump and the other one is Camila one will be Camila that is voted in so far we see how votes went the other one might be Trump that will let the Roman Catholic Church come in because of the pressure of the Roman Catholic church because America owes her trillions of dollars they can't even pay back the interest so will she put the screws on Trump if he gets elected and he will give in then to her and afterwards speak as the dragon it's to two scenarios here because the Roman Catholic Church when he says the Roman Catholic Church he says I got it in Brackets and you know what that mean I don't have to take you to school so um he says all the Catholic Church to human then he concludes the quote by saying thus saith the Lord so if it must come to pass is this the season for it you might have to check that thing out then in condemnation by representation then I seen a great woman rise up in the USA well dressed beautiful but cruel in heart she will either guide or lead this nation to ruination I got in parenthesis perhaps the Roman Catholic Church the second woman is well dressed and beautiful not the first one now we all were under the delusion that that woman that will come in the first one will be well-dressed and beautiful and many people will turn back and say well we don't think it's Camila because she's not so beautiful but he didn't put the emphasis on kamila the first woman he says the second woman the Roman Catholic Church is well dressed and cruel and beautiful now she's so beautiful that the Bible says when John saw her he marveled so beautiful the Roman Catholic Church is we're just eitting the Bible you know we just want you to see the Bible how brother Brandon put things down and he leaves it there for you to go check it up in the Bible so there's the Bible for it she's a beautiful woman he doesn't say that the first woman is pretty the second one then after that he seen USA lay in ashes after this woman comes in by votes or by force through maybe Trump he's the most uh eligible guy to let her come in because his name is Trump does he have the trump card to let it come in I'm just asking so um she will come in at the sixth the end of the sixth vision and then he says then after that he seen USA lay in ashes which is the seventh Vision the atomic bomb when it come to the end he says when it come to the end then he turns around and says it was the end so the seven vision is the end of the Earth and there's ases men mention here which is the atomic bomb so that why he says that's the beginning of it so he says the seven Vision ashes the USA uh is the end but the bride at this time is gone he said before the first eight bomb Falls we'll be in glory so we won't even see the end of the Earth that's why I said it you know we are not here when that seven Vision hit um as I said that pressure will be put on her now how is she coming in big question saw it in 1933 he saw it in 1933 how she will come in Ephesians Church age 196 and the woman being permitted to vote would help to elect the wrong person for this nation that would be the beginning we got back to human again now the woman's vote in America will swing the president don't see her way if they W vote for her because there's more woman voters than men voters there is more human voters in the states than men and right now the poll says the woman of the USA favor Camila Harris she pushes for abortion rights for women and woman can do with their bodies what they want the government can't tell a woman what to do with their bodies this is what woman is waiting for and Camila is a woman that said she will give it to them she'll sign it in to law will she come in with a woman vote it pretty much look like it so we have it right in front of us it closes with this it might be the beginning that quotation it might be the beginning of what what beginning of the seventh Vision the end of the world the human vote is the beginning of the end now five of the seven Visions came to pass the first V the second W 41 ashes atomic bomb is passed at this time with a second world war this now lays in the history books it's out of the Bible into the history books the message why seven things I saw five of them as of already come to pass what's left of the seven Visions the sixth vision and then which is woman president six vision and then the seventh the very very end the uh atomic bomb to follow the six Vision that's the end so Camila's election will be the beginning of the the end so it's obvious now remember let me let me bring this in is the beginning of the end but before the end comes the Rapture takes place get that straight so it's obvious we seeing the sixth one unfolding I say it very much look like it if if if it is then lift up your heads your Redemption of your body is n it's the beginning of the seven vision and the end of the six is that fair comment I think it is fair commence because brother Brenham says in desperation that the newspapers preaches much louder than the ministers and I want to say the ministers in this message because Pentecost is long gone denomination brother B says there's nothing wrong in probing in C is this the time and I probe and this is what I come up with we'll found find out in a few days time now I just want to give you this quote ludian Church age 1960 the nation is a woman's Nation the flag was made by a woman it's number 13 a human now this is a quote it started out 13 stars and 13 stripes woman 13 colonies woman both woman 13 stars on a silver dollar woman appears in Revelations 13 woman everything is human human human human human right on down they already worship a woman anyhow a woman's picture on the money end of quote and I want to add to all that the Statue of Liberty welcomes you into USA which is a woman right in the quotation this is the situation now in the States you can't deny it especially in the message this is scario this is what the ancient culture says the number 13 is represented as feminine which is woman straight with brother brenham's called as the ancient culture says why because it responded to the number of lunar menstral circles in a year 13 * 28 equal 364 days the theory is that as the solar calendar triumphed over the lunan the number 13 becomes anema there's two meanings to anema it means one excommunication by a church two person that's curs or condemned by God the seventh Vision she's condemned by God Los Angeles condemned by God Yellowstone condemned by God abam Seven Vision condemned by God a Prophet prophesying this condemned by God through thus saith the Lord oh my God nature tells you it is so Bible tells you it is so the prophet tells you it is so now the dictionary tells you so as Luke 17:26 says you'll hear it again we're going to play it again for you as it was in the days of Noah hum then Genesis uh Sodom and gomorra Lot's wife remember her Genesis 19 wife again a woman both Noah's day Noah's Genesis 6 Daughters of men became Fair became pretty human and lot's day Sodom Genesis 19 Lot's wife and Jesus tells us in this age remember Lot's wife woman both the end came with woman so shall it be in our day are we seeing the scripture being fulfilled I ask you El Tabernacle check it up I cannot see it any other way but we have to mention it to keep you alert you know so that you know to lift up your head and be already and Virgil and when the time comes she has invaded every space in the world today she's on motor cars all the blackards and all that you know a woman will rise and become president is God going to keep his word that's what he says in that message she choose a partner for vice president and look at this how can we miss it Tim Walls the sure is modern events made clear by prophecy is it prophecy made clear by modern events I looked I like this one I just swapped that title around of brother Brenan and said prophecy this is the prophecy Revelations 13 is the prophecy woman's vote is the prophecy made clear by modern events I like like this one for my day not a one that Revelations 10:8 says prophesy again this is all in the prophesy again do it again and then we have the picture of Biden Statue of Liberty Moon and Kema heris now sit back and listen to the clip thank you the United States of America a woman's Nation comments by the Apostle Edgar Hill Rosco Joe Biden his name means associated with woman he chose a woman as vice president he resigned from the 2024 presidential race on the 21th July 2024 a Blood Moon Over the Statue of Liberty the same night Joe Biden resigns from the presidential race the moon represents a woman the Statue of Liberty representing a woman the next day the endorsement of a woman as candidate for US president Camala Harris [Music] Revelation 13 a woman the United States of America now you don't have to be super spiritual to see this to see what God wants us to see the whole thing is women and now there is 10 women for one man Genesis 6:1 and it came to pass when men began to multiply on the face of the Earth and daughters were born unto them not men was born unto them daughters but daughters were born unto them men so it's fulfilled the daughters were Fair they're pretty even take the black women they're pretty a sign that it is finish can you read this look at this chart and still believe it's not the end Genesis 6:2 and they took them WI of all which they chose then and they took unto themselves wives they don't marry them she just shifts or moves in with you this was Noah's day then the scripture says in Luke the 17:26 and as it was in the days of Noah woman so shall it be also in the days of the son of man Genesis 18:9 and they said unto him where is Sarah thy wife a woman Genesis 18:26 but his wife looked back from behind him and she became a pillar of salt Lot's wife woman again we need to remember Lot's wife Luke 17: 29-32 but the same day that lot went out of Sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven and destroyed them all even thus shall it be in the day when the the son of man is revealed remember Lot's wife lot's day then the end comes when women is displaying themselves now church can you see this pattern being displayed in front of you a sign of the end in there homosexuality at the Olympics openly displayed in a mock show piece that mocks the last supper after they had that the pale horse rider ran out through the water you had to see it the devil made legit then the last thing is the message can't see this clearly she is a woman's Nation she stood in the Forefront in this debate she invaded every space in the world and I predict that a woman will be a great woman you younger people here tonight remember brother Brandon has said this and I said it in 33 when I saw the coming of the Lord and how the automobiles are continually shape up like an age until finally they would come into a perfect age shape maybe part of the Year NOS written on Old papers and things and I seen a woman rid vulgar as she was and dominated the country and I predict that a woman will either be president or do or come into great power of some sort in the United States before the total anation of the world keep that in mind and I have said it the title God keeps his word let's see if God keeps his word now many of you know before I was elected vice president or elected a United State Senator I was an elected attorney general and before that elected district attorney and before that I was a courtroom prosecutor the rise of camela Harris she came from being a courtroom prosecutor San Francisco City Hall then a district attorney San Francisco California then Attorney General of California then a United States Senator then Vice President of the United States now she is running for president of the United States of America look how she Rises up exactly like the quote says Tuesday 6th of August 2024 she chose her partner for vice president she didn't choose a woman to partner her she chose a man ironically she chooses a partner by the name of Tim Waltz Waltz is a dance with a musical beat quite difficult to master what does it mean what does this entail and what is God trying to tell us this is what Waltz

Vision presidency prophecy is modern events made clear by prophecy prophecy will make modern events clear it's clear to us that love this message if she becomes the president it is the end not the very end there's still a time will the devil enter her and the pope Revelation 13 and Revelation 17 then we have the seventh Vision the atomic bomb the third world war the annihilation of America and the world the end of the world we don't know what and where the Middle East is boiling the Ukraine and Russian war is escalating the Uproar in Many Nations is causing concern in Africa it's worrying it's tightening towards the seventh Vision can you see why she has to come in first to open the seventh Vision by her coming in I believe this Revelation 7 will happen afterwards WS after what the six seals Revelation 6 the sixth trumpet Revelation 7 verse1 and after these things I saw four Angels standing on the four corners of the Earth holding the Four Winds of the earth that the wind should not blow on the earth nor on the sea nor on any tree Four Winds War worldwide atomic bomb that's why they can't throw the atomic bomb Revelation 7:2 must happen after this Revelation 7:2 and I saw another Angel ascending from the East having the Seal of the Living God and he cried with a loud voice to the four angels to whom it was given to hurt the earth and the Sea atomic bomb Revelation 7:3 saying hurt not the Earth neither the sea nor the tree till we have sealed the Servants of our God in their foreheads which is the 144,000 Jews now notice at the closing of this these Jews returning saying they were looking for the Messiah to come a great Spiritual Awakening to come in immediately after coming out of the here going right into Israel where there's never been any fanaticism or carrying on or anything right into Virgin Territory and I believe if there will be Awakening of the old Jews for about a million or two to receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost Jesus Christ will come on the scene as certain as anything there's your quote so the Holy Ghost will be taken away from the Gentiles this is the Camala Harris that makes me worried [Music] you can probe into this to find out if it is so because it's history and may God keep us true until the breakup day amen [Music] Our [Music] Father which are in heaven [Music] be th name thy kingom come thy will be the on on Earth as it is in heav
