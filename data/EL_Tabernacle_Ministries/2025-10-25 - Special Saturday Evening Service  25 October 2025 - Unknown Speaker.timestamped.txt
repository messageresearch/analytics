[1:01:13] [applause]
[1:01:17] &gt;&gt; All the years
[1:01:21] of turmoil

[1:01:26] &gt;&gt; sweat,
[1:01:29] &gt;&gt; and tears
[1:01:31] &gt;&gt; and labor.
[1:01:37] &gt;&gt; It's worth

[1:02:56] [cheering]
[1:03:01] [cheering]
[1:03:05] &gt;&gt; We don't have it on that one. [cheering]
[1:03:07] &gt;&gt; Oh, okay.
[1:03:10] I want the world to see it.
[1:03:17] Can we read it?

[1:04:31] [applause]
[1:04:33] [cheering]
[1:04:38] love you. [applause]
[1:04:41] [cheering]
[1:04:53] There
[1:04:55] there has never been anything like that
[1:04:57] in the Bible.
[1:05:00] &gt;&gt; There's
[1:05:02] never been anything like that
[1:05:06] &gt;&gt; in the end time message.
[1:05:10] &gt;&gt; [cheering]
[1:05:15] [applause]
[1:05:18] [cheering]
[1:05:24] [applause and cheering]
[1:05:26] &gt;&gt; So, it's so good
[1:05:30] &gt;&gt; to be able to
[1:05:34] &gt;&gt; not only quote Bible
[1:05:38] &gt;&gt; but to manifest
[1:05:40] &gt;&gt; [cheering and applause]
[1:05:45] [cheering]
[1:05:49] [applause]
[1:05:53] [cheering]
[1:05:55] [applause]
[1:05:57] &gt;&gt; We
[1:06:01] could even say brother Burnham didn't
[1:06:03] have the opportunity
[1:06:09] And uh this weekend you didn't only come
[1:06:13] to a service,
[1:06:15] &gt;&gt; you come to this day.
[1:06:19] &gt;&gt; The scripture
[1:06:23] [cheering and applause] is to
[1:06:30] [cheering]
[1:06:34] [applause]
[1:06:37] &gt;&gt; [cheering]
[1:06:41] [applause]
[1:06:48] &gt;&gt; But what's happening now
[1:06:53] is far more greater than this quote.
[1:06:57] [applause]
[1:07:01] &gt;&gt; Why? [applause]
[1:07:04] Why?
[1:07:06] Because Jesus says
[1:07:09] a son
[1:07:11] &gt;&gt; and a grandson and a grandfather,
[1:07:15] &gt;&gt; but I got two sons and I've got two
[1:07:19] grandsons.
[1:07:21] So it's bigger than this. [cheering]
[1:07:27] [applause]
[1:07:31] [cheering]
[1:07:33] [applause]
[1:07:37] [cheering]
[1:07:38] [applause]
[1:07:43] &gt;&gt; I have already preached with my sons and
[1:07:46] grandsons.
[1:07:48] But I just felt in my spirit,
[1:07:52] &gt;&gt; I like to preach with my grandsons.
[1:07:57] [applause]
[1:08:06] [applause]
[1:08:09] &gt;&gt; And it's far more greater
[1:08:14] than President Mandela.
[1:08:17] &gt;&gt; [cheering]
[1:08:19] [applause]
[1:08:20] &gt;&gt; There's something more greater
[1:08:23] than President Mandela [cheering]
[1:08:27] because he's got no sons that can follow
[1:08:29] him. I have
[1:08:33] and not a kingdom of South Africa, the
[1:08:37] kingdom of heaven.
[1:08:40] [cheering]
[1:08:47] &gt;&gt; [cheering]
[1:08:51] [applause]
[1:08:53] [cheering]
[1:08:56] &gt;&gt; So we come to manifest
[1:09:00] &gt;&gt; that scripture.
[1:09:04] &gt;&gt; Such a lot of scriptures has been
[1:09:05] fulfilled.
[1:09:07] &gt;&gt; Makes sense to the word is fulfilled.

[1:12:19] [cheering]
[1:12:25] [applause]
[1:12:27] [cheering]
[1:12:30] &gt;&gt; We give out eternal life
[1:12:35] &gt;&gt; to men

[1:12:43] &gt;&gt; We gave them eternal life.
[1:12:45] The year turn
[1:12:49] [cheering]
[1:12:50] &gt;&gt; fulfilled.
[1:12:56] [cheering]

[1:13:04] got one prisoner off the hook
[1:13:08] &gt;&gt; and they gave him a medallion or

[1:15:23] [cheering]
[1:15:32] &gt;&gt; I'm happy to be with you again.
[1:15:35] [cheering]
[1:15:35] [applause]
[1:15:37] &gt;&gt; Last night when
[1:15:40] Joe finished preach
[1:15:42] and nearly simultaneously
[1:15:45] me and Jonathan told him, "Um, him and
[1:15:48] his brother Joel,
[1:15:51] man,
[1:15:52] if we get a little more older,
[1:15:56] &gt;&gt; don't put us out of your church, okay?"
[1:15:58] Amen.
[1:16:00] [applause]
[1:16:06] [applause]
[1:16:06] &gt;&gt; So don't put me out of this church.
[1:16:11] [applause]
[1:16:16] &gt;&gt; I wouldn't go.
[1:16:22] &gt;&gt; You can't get rid of me. [cheering]
[1:16:27] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[1:16:30] [cheering]
[1:16:33] [applause]
[1:16:35] &gt;&gt; So I greet all of you.
[1:16:38] I wish we could have been under one
[1:16:39] roof. I see where it's full next door.
[1:16:42] And the tent is also full.
[1:16:46] &gt;&gt; And uh
[1:16:48] but uh as long as you a couple of feet
[1:16:51] from the anointing,
[1:16:54] &gt;&gt; you will still feel
[1:16:55] &gt;&gt; [cheering]
[1:16:58] [applause]
[1:17:01] [cheering]
[1:17:05] [applause]
[1:17:08] &gt;&gt; Now tonight we have a mixed crowd
[1:17:12] and I have to cater for a mixed crowd.
[1:17:16] I have to also preach ABCs around
[1:17:19] &gt;&gt; the band here
[1:17:22] &gt;&gt; and uh
[1:17:26] um
[1:17:28] to reach everybody
[1:17:33] and um
[1:17:36] therefore I'd like to go to what I'm
[1:17:38] busy with
[1:17:41] &gt;&gt; Matthew 25
[1:17:45] If your Bibles with you,
[1:17:48] [applause]
[1:17:50] &gt;&gt; we turn to Matthew 25.
[1:18:01] &gt;&gt; Just one verse.
[1:18:20] Matthew 25
[1:18:23] verse two.
[1:18:26] [crying]
[1:18:29] And five of them
[1:18:31] were wise
[1:18:37] and five
[1:18:40] were foolish.
[1:18:44] Half of the church
[1:18:48] &gt;&gt; was foolish.
[1:19:00] And I'm not going to speak about the
[1:19:02] wise.
[1:19:05] &gt;&gt; I want to speak on the foolish church.
[1:19:10] &gt;&gt; The foolish
[1:19:13] church.
[1:19:16] It's quite strange that God
[1:19:23] &gt;&gt; will put two churches
[1:19:27] &gt;&gt; right in the coming of the Lord
[1:19:31] &gt;&gt; right at the time
[1:19:34] &gt;&gt; when Messiah comes.
[1:19:39] &gt;&gt; Right at that time
[1:19:43] &gt;&gt; where
[1:19:45] Trump put up taxes to tax the people.
[1:19:50] &gt;&gt; As Herod tax the people,
[1:19:55] &gt;&gt; they had to go to Bethlehem where Jesus
[1:19:57] had to be born because of taxes.
[1:20:03] [cheering and applause]
[1:20:05] &gt;&gt; The first coming taxes
[1:20:10] &gt;&gt; and now
[1:20:12] &gt;&gt; taxes again.
[1:20:16] at the coming of the Lord.
[1:20:23] &gt;&gt; So there'll be two churches right
[1:20:27] &gt;&gt; today.
[1:20:32] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[1:20:33] &gt;&gt; There'll be a wise church
[1:20:38] &gt;&gt; and there'll be a foolish church.
[1:20:43] &gt;&gt; And
[1:20:45] you have to think
[1:20:48] &gt;&gt; in which church you are in
[1:20:51] &gt;&gt; tonight.
[1:20:54] [applause and cheering]
[1:20:58] The El Tabernacle
[1:21:00] is a foolish church.
[1:21:03] And I want to tell you, you better get
[1:21:05] out
[1:21:07] &gt;&gt; and go look where there is
[1:21:10] &gt;&gt; a wise church
[1:21:13] &gt;&gt; where the scriptures are being
[1:21:14] fulfilled.
[1:21:15] [applause]
[1:21:17] And if you're from any other church,
[1:21:20] may you sit here in this meeting tonight
[1:21:24] and may you do some calculations in your
[1:21:27] mind
[1:21:29] &gt;&gt; and ask yourself the question,
[1:21:32] &gt;&gt; do I belong to a foolish church
[1:21:37] &gt;&gt; or do I belong to
[1:21:41] &gt;&gt; a wise church? [cheering]
[1:21:44] [applause]
[1:21:48] &gt;&gt; [cheering]
[1:21:53] [applause]
[1:21:59] &gt;&gt; We want to find that out tonight.
[1:22:04] [applause]
[1:22:05] &gt;&gt; Now, so ironic,
[1:22:08] &gt;&gt; nobody actually spoke on this,
[1:22:12] &gt;&gt; but the king himself.
[1:22:16] Hallelujah.
[1:22:17] &gt;&gt; No disciples spoke on this.
[1:22:22] &gt;&gt; No scribe,
[1:22:25] &gt;&gt; no Pharisee,
[1:22:30] &gt;&gt; but the Lord himself.
[1:22:33] [applause]
[1:22:37] [cheering]
[1:22:39] [applause]
[1:22:40] And he tells us
[1:22:44] &gt;&gt; in that time,
[1:22:46] &gt;&gt; open your eyes,
[1:22:48] &gt;&gt; there's going to be two churches,
[1:22:52] [applause]
[1:22:56] &gt;&gt; one foolish church,
[1:23:00] and one wise church.
[1:23:03] &gt;&gt; And you will have to fight through it
[1:23:05] all.
[1:23:07] It's not easy to get into the wise
[1:23:10] church.
[1:23:12] [cheering]
[1:23:15] &gt;&gt; It is a battle.
[1:23:18] It is a revelation.
[1:23:21] [cheering]
[1:23:23] [applause]
[1:23:26] [cheering]
[1:23:32] [cheering]
[1:23:34] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[1:23:38] &gt;&gt; And the king says in Matthew 25,
[1:23:43] &gt;&gt; he said, "Just before I come,
[1:23:48] &gt;&gt; and I hope if you're in El Tabernacle
[1:23:51] &gt;&gt; that you're not foolish.
[1:23:56] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[1:24:03] &gt;&gt; Now why is she foolish?
[1:24:06] &gt;&gt; Why is this church foolish?
[1:24:09] Webster dictionary says
[1:24:12] a fool is somebody
[1:24:15] &gt;&gt; lacking understanding
[1:24:18] &gt;&gt; can't understand
[1:24:20] &gt;&gt; why this people
[1:24:25] &gt;&gt; going like a bunch of mad [cheering]
[1:24:30] heresy
[1:24:32] worshippers
[1:24:33] can't understand. [cheering]
[1:24:44] [cheering]
[1:24:51] A fool is somebody
[1:24:56] &gt;&gt; that lacks judgment
[1:25:00] &gt;&gt; or choosing.
[1:25:03] &gt;&gt; They can't judge properly.
[1:25:06] [cheering]
[1:25:09] [applause]
[1:25:10] &gt;&gt; That's a fool.
[1:25:14] or
[1:25:16] she can't even see common sense,
[1:25:23] &gt;&gt; apples and pears.
[1:25:26] &gt;&gt; She can't discern
[1:25:29] common sense. [cheering]
[1:25:33] [applause]
[1:25:38] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[1:25:42] &gt;&gt; or one that's fooled.
[1:25:46] &gt;&gt; One that's fooled
[1:25:48] get deceived
[1:25:50] with the wrong
[1:25:53] ignorant
[1:25:57] &gt;&gt; things of the world.
[1:26:02] &gt;&gt; Is it to influence them?
[1:26:07] by family
[1:26:10] &gt;&gt; or friends
[1:26:13] &gt;&gt; or popular opinion.
[1:26:15] [applause]
[1:26:17] &gt;&gt; I rather go with a stream.
[1:26:20] &gt;&gt; I rather go with a majority of the
[1:26:23] people
[1:26:26] &gt;&gt; than to accept the right thing.
[1:26:30] [cheering]
[1:26:32] &gt;&gt; That's a fool.
