TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Applause] [Music] okay and I and I love my [Music] work I just I just love this job 36 years I'm doing this job and I still love it and if there's another 36 years I don't know amen I just love it this morning I I I sure didn't have much time with this message I I forgot to look at the program and brother Paul phoned me Friday night and then uh uh I had the wedding and what have you so u i um had to jump in quickly and draw this up and um I pray that you pray for me that God would bless it amen amen and uh as you know now that uh these videos goes all over and I cannot take no chances so um I have to make double sure because there might be a soul in stake somewhere and it'll help that soul and uh when I get over there I don't want to be empty-handed you know I want want some souls to my name [Music] amen if I should entitle this message I'd entitle it cometh the hour cometh the man cometh the hour then cometh the man in every hour that God has predestinated for anything to happen you'll have a man to go with it so come at the hour cometh the man and I would like to take my thought from this quotation that I gave you Church Ages page 246 and that's the reason I wrote those scriptures they cried Hosanna hosana because that was the hour and that was the man [Applause] but in the case of Luther God's time was ripe come of the hour for a definite move he says but in the time of Luther the man God's time was right right the hour for a definite move that that would be the beginning of the restoration when the hour came God had the man and God don't work any other way that's the only way God works and he doesn't break his pattern when the hour comes God will have the right man at that hour to do the work that heaven can do only he says in Luther God's got a man then God's time was right for justification so cometh the hour so cometh the man if the hour hour comes then it's automatically God has the man [Music] [Applause] automatically God has the man when the hour comes amen because we can only serve God through a representative there is no other way that you can serve God you have to make sure that you get the representative and that representative is proven by God and that's the only way that we can serve God Amen is by that representative if you do not accept the representative then you do not accept God because that is the ambassador of Heaven to you and when you you don't accept that Ambassador you cannot be saved and I want to say this this morning if God has an ambassador in this hour and that's the only way that God is going to work through God is going to lift up that Ambassador God is going to show everybody that that Ambassador is the right Ambassador because cometh the hour cometh the man amen if the hour is here the man must be there [Applause] Hallelujah because we can only serve God through a representative amen and Jesus said in St John 20:21 he says as the father sent me so send I you amen praise God God did not not only send me Jesus Christ but God send me amen so that I can send you to be an ambassador at the right hour at the right time this is my time now because the father sent me but there's coming a time where the father's going to send you to be ambassadors and workers for the kingdom of God for when the hour comes amen the man cometh to amen you can't have the hour outside of the man if the hour is here the man is here for I send you Hallelujah to preach the gospel and raise the dead amen [Music] [Applause] hallelujah as the father sent me so send I you amen how did the father send him to preach Deliverance Amen to bring the Holy Ghost Terry he in Jerusalem until you endured with power from on high amen and brother Here We Are Tonight today we are in the same same commission that Jesus Christ had because he sent us amen and when you receive us you receive him and when you receive him you receive his kingdom and when you receive his kingdom you receive the Holy Ghost and when you receive the Holy Ghost you receive the comforter and when you receive the comforter you receive the Dove and when you receive the dove amen it leads you into the promise of God [Applause] hallelujah and when God send that man man he is never received he is never never received cometh the hour cometh the man but the man never gets received amen everybody will be against him everybody will speak against him when Jesus Christ came they couldn't receive him amen they call him a wine Bubba they call him a glonous amen they call him a a man that's born out of wedlock amen they didn't like him they call him babab amen the king of the Devils but cometh the hour cometh the man God send him and there's nothing nobody can do amen [Applause] [Music] [Applause] hallelujah they didn't receive him they rejected him they criticized him the Pharisees was against him the churches was against him amen the preachers was against him but God didn't change his mind because they were against him because this was God's Ambassador this was God's representation upon the Earth and God stood with him amen because cometh the hour cometh the man [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] Hallelujah and if the man is there he's never received why a prophet is not known in his own country Matthew 13 verse 57 a prophet is not known in his own country and if God send a Prophet uh and God a prophet is a new testament preacher even in this message they won't receive him because he's not known amen they just look at him and says well that's so and so and that's so and so because he's not accepted if they accept him that churches will be empty if they say that that man has the word of God that churches will be empty so they've got to be against him amen jealousy comes up in them because God gave the man a gift amen and that gift is without doubt amen that that's the hour and that's the man cometh the hour cometh the [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] man and Jesus said amen in Luke 23:31 he says if they have done this to a green tree how much more shouldn't they do that to a dry tree amen if they done that to me they will do it to them that I sent to amen and brother I'm so glad that I'm one of the ministers that can say they did it to me but here I stand because cometh the hour cometh the man and there's nothing nobody can do about that God in heaven will back up that man regardless of how many split away from him cometh the hour cometh the [Music] [Applause] man [Applause] [Music] if he is accepted then he's not the man if he is accepted then it has broken every scripture amen why because every time God has a man he's rejected everybody that likees likes him that's a bad sign amen it's a bad bad sign if everybody likes that man that's a bad sign that's not the man because right through in the word of God they hated the prophets they killed the prophets amen but how could you be a man of God and everybody loves you it can't be that way amen when they even hated your God Amen they even spoke bad about your God how much more shouldn't they speak bad about you that's a true sign that you are not called that's a true sign that God never called you look for a man amen that everybody hates uh everybody speaks against everybody loves to love to hate him that's the man and that's a good sign [Applause] [Music] yes [Music] [Applause] that's a bad sign if everybody loves him amen because the word of God says for so persecuted they the prophets which were before them in Matthew 5:12 so persecuted they the prophets amen that was before them they hated the prophets because a prophet amen don't compromise a prophet amen will tell you Black is Black and white is white amen a prophet puts the thing down amen a prophet is somebody that speaks God's mind and not the people's mind and not the preachers mind and not the church's mind and not that up and Up's mind they speak the mind of God and what God wants amen so persecuted they the [Applause] prophets [Applause] he says in Matthew 23:29 you build the tombs of the prophets and gares the seul of the righteous not only the prophets but even the righteous not only do they kill the prophets but the righteous that comes behind the prophet and say exactly what the prophet said they like to kill him they like to garnish his tomb when he dies then he want to say what a great man and amen he had a give brother they garnish the tombs of the righteous the man the man he's always rejected evil spoken of criticized hey man but whenever they criticize him God just blesses him all [Applause] that's one of the true signs one of the true signs that he is the man of God Amen when they reject him and criticize him and look fault in him that's a true sign one of the true signs the other sign is amen he always tries to run away from the job when they try to choose him he runs away that's another sign then he sticks to the word of God that's another sign then he anoints the word of God that's another sign then he lives the sermon that he preached that's another sign then he has three pools in his life healing preaching amen and speak the word and it manifest itself amen then you have the man then you have the man then you have the man Hallelujah then you have the Mind [Applause] Glory Jesus Jesus had three pools in his life amen he three steps in his life and in his ministry his first step he came and he healed the sick his second step was he preached the word of God and they hated him for it his third step was was he went down into hell and preached to the prisons to the people that was lost here at three pools and every man that is called of God must have three pools in his life not only preaching he must have a gift of healing not only healing he must speak the word only and it must go out like Thunderbolts of lightning then you have the man then you have the man [Applause] [Music] [Applause] don't only look for a man that preach one sermon and then you fall for him no brother amen he must preach every time the Holy Ghost must be there amen he must heal the sick through the power of a Mighty God he must be an ambassador on the earth he must LIF the life amen praise God Amen then we have the man that's the man you got to look for don't give your soul over to anything else he must have his qualities he must have the Holy Ghost he must have the word he must

what brother every man that follows a man like that is hated the people that follows him is hated amen oh do you go are you by brother so and so's Church oh we know him amen they don't like you why because you have met the man Hallelujah you have had met the man that has the qualities amen that the word of God said you have amen hallelujah because if you work against Power you'll burn amen when you work against Power you burn when you take the wrong wires and you connect it and you switch it on it'll blow up amen because you're working against power but when you work with power the lights goes on and when you work with the power of God in a God man there is God man man that's trained by God God trained man but this is the hour and there must be man that's train Hallelujah to take the word of God further Hallelujah and there must be Believers that stands behind the man same and [Applause] [Music] somebody [Applause] [Music] [Applause] in Luther's day somewhere in the 15th century in the late 14th century yeah many came before him protesting the Roman Catholic Church many came before Luther and they protesting protested against the Roman Catholic church in Church Ages page 254 God raised up many Mighty Men of which Luther was one but one Calvin and and swing swingley were two other luminaries and beside these were many many more who are not so well known many many more more amen was there with Luther and they protested the Roman Catholic Church God will have men with these God men that will go out and protest against the wrong thing whether they like it or whether they don't amen there will be men that will stand with a man of God if that is the hour that is the man and there will be man that will preach exactly what that man says amen and they'll stand under promises uh what that man has stood on Amen and they will not Sherk uh they will not be pulled back they will not be ashamed of the Gospel of Jesus Christ amen they will stand therefore because cometh the hour cometh a [Applause] man many helpers will come when the real man is there they'll just feel to do something for God they know that this is God's path and they want to be in it and they want their names written too and they want other names written next to their names and they'll go out amen as workers of the Gospel of Jesus Christ you workers that go out amen amen God put that in your heart it doesn't come from you it comes from God Amen [Music] [Applause] many a men many of men came before Luther amen and they started the split from the Roman Catholic church but in Luther the split actually came they only caused the trem but Luther got brought the earthquake amen they were men that preach exactly what Luther preached they stood what Luther stood for but they couldn't bring a Reformation they couldn't bring the split from the Roman Catholic church amen why because it was in the hour and they were in the man Calvin and zwingley and Hassam amen they preached the way Luther preached they stood on the things Luther stood they protested against the Roman Catholic church but that was not the hour and they were not the man but when the hour came H amen cometh the hour cometh the man Luther Step Up amen and shook the Roman Catholic Church as he thundered against the Roman Catholic church because he was the man and he was in the hour amen and brother we are in the hour and we have the [Music] man we have the man 54 Ministry [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] man [Applause] they split the Roman Catholic Church they broke away from the Roman Catholic church because of Luther God anointed Luther God gave him the power to split the church without them killing him because one of those uh reformers said one day a goose will come that you won't be able to kill and he was prophesying about Luther and when Luther came it was the hour they couldn't kill this go amen they killed everybody else but they couldn't kill him why because cometh the hour cometh the man and not even a pope could get rid of him not even clever man could get rid of him not even teachers could get rid of him because cometh the hour sister Judith cometh the man they can't get rid of him until God is finished with him [Applause] they split away from the Roman Catholic church because there was a new age coming the only time that you can split if there's a new age if there's another messenger if there's another message amen then you can leave the old message and go into the new message but amen between amen 1520 and 1750 in the sad Church age amen while you've been in the sadan church age under the anointing of uh of Martin Luther if you split there you lost you lost amen there's no way you can be saved because that's the move of God Amen there's where God was moving and God wasn't going to move with anybody else but with Luther amen so if you wanted to split from him God cut you off amen because that is the age that is the hour and that is the man you lost if you do [Applause] [Music] that God was busy with justification and nothing else nothing else even if somebody says well I I feel now you got to be Sanctified amen it's not time for sanctification it's time for justification for the just shall live by faith [Applause] Hallelujah that was the new message and there's where God was roaming around especially in this age of Brotherly kindness this age of honey this age of Psalm 133 how good and how pleasant it is for brothers to dwell together this is the age of how pleasant it is for brothers to dwell together how can you split in an age like this when the age is brotherly kindness and you split you're breaking God's word you're breaking inspiration you're telling God that he made a mistake amen this cannot be that age we need to split no this

holy ghost in a man Hallelujah that's God's representative whether you like it or not that's thus sayeth the Lord and I'm soad glad that I packed the Holy Ghost amen and I preached the Holy Ghost and I gave out the Holy Ghost and that's God's Representative no other representative for work but that representative Hallelujah today is the Holy Ghost a thing that really hurt me for many many years and you must have heard about it many times when I heard that the Pentecostal says you know you in that message you have the word but you don't have the spirit it hurt me for years and years and as I went right around the world in the message I found it to be the truth and I'm truthful in front of God I cannot lie behind the pulpit I found the church is dead dry and sty and all it's word word word word word I couldn't say it's not so because I do not know whether they visited any any church in the message and that's the reason they came up with it and it hurt me it hurt me so very much that I said oh God what's going on I know these people is talking the truth and I know that your Prophet said Lord there must be a feeling in itth Amen in uncertain sounds there must be a feeling in itth and I said oh God I know that the prophet said that this message takes us back to the Holy Ghost and Lord the only sign that I know that I'm in the message if my heart is turned back to the Pentecostal fathers then I'll only know that I'm in the message Lord and brother amen I thank God while God knew my heart and I was sulking and I was waiting for God then came 79 the hour amen and then cometh the man hell and then cometh the man amen and then cometh the man sayen say amen I am not ashamed of the Gospel of Jesus Christ for it's the power of God hallelujah oh oh Hallelujah 10 cometh the hour 10
