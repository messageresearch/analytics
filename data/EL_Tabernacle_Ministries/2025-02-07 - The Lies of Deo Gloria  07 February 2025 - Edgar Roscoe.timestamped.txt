[0:09] well good evening friends or good
[0:14] morning um I have said that I am uh
[0:19] going
[0:20] to count U the restoration of the
[0:25] Gloria and um the veterans
[0:30] that's there will be bringing back the
[0:33] restoration
[0:36] of the
[0:38] Gloria
[0:40] so I am not against
[0:45] that I just want to show in this in this
[0:50] video clip that I'm going to play to
[0:52] you that the
[0:55] restoration didn't take
[0:58] place and I just want show you that for
[1:02] 40
[1:03] years up till now after the
[1:08] 20 um
[1:11] 2024 restoration of the Glorious
[1:14] meetings it's not back in any other
[1:17] Church what you're going to see
[1:20] here
[1:22] so I want to say this that I am not
[1:30] fighting this anymore because Monday my
[1:34] whole perspective
[1:36] changed as said we believe what we
[1:40] believe and Abigail your father believes
[1:42] what he believes we don't see what your
[1:45] father sees and your father don't see
[1:46] what I see that settled it for me
[1:51] because a thing that had me all was
[1:54] Ezekiel when you see somebody do wrong
[1:57] and you don't straighten him out he's
[1:59] blood is on your hands and that was
[2:02] since a young man that he had me that's
[2:04] why I was so bold but I told God now
[2:08] that thing is off me now everybody
[2:11] sealed in and everybody believed what
[2:13] they believe so I will not be going into
[2:17] these things
[2:20] anymore as far
[2:22] as speaking
[2:25] about their beliefs they can chop me
[2:28] with my beliefs it's fine
[2:31] I think I'm big enough to take
[2:33] it as I said with George Martin I'm not
[2:36] going to mention him again and I could
[2:38] have I could have blasted them now with
[2:40] a
[2:41] split you know but it's not my business
[2:44] that's their business they got to go on
[2:47] I must say that I had some people that
[2:49] went to the breakup Church of George
[2:52] Martin and U they did report back to me
[2:55] I I went as far as that you know I just
[2:57] wanted to know if I'm right so uh I hope
[3:02] that you're honest brother brandham says
[3:05] the gospel trumpet is
[3:07] blowing and it's the good
[3:10] news and it says the good news is the
[3:13] Holy Ghost is
[3:14] here he says how do we know it's yeah
[3:18] you watch how it works its
[3:22] manifestation and then he mentions one
[3:24] of the things which the other things
[3:26] I'll mention with my next
[3:28] message um
[3:30] one of the things it brings back is
[3:32] honesty to be
[3:34] honest so uh if the Holy Ghost is y back
[3:39] we're going to have honesty and I just
[3:40] want to be honest you look at deog
[3:43] Gloria what is deog Gloria you young
[3:46] guys you know and see if it going to

[8:11] convention in this video brother Coleman
[8:14] clearly experienced his first genuine
[8:16] touch during a significant outpouring of
[8:19] the Holy Spirit following this sister's
[8:22] testimony she shared her encounter with
[8:24] the mighty angel of God during another
[8:26] meeting in Johannesburg
[8:29] sister bapsy was the first witness to
[8:31] confirm that the Angelic visitations did
[8:33] not begin at the Deo Gloria convention
[8:36] instead she had multiple encounters with
[8:39] the angel while staying with the late
[8:41] sister Moses in Johannesburg see aen
[8:44] from Johannesburg she has a testimony
[8:47] that Sheen the angel of
[8:50] [Applause]
[8:54] the you say but brother can we see
[8:58] angels listen your man read the book of
[9:03] Acts in the book of Acts there was
[9:06] Angels te in all
[9:09] chapter and the Heart being rest back
[9:12] it's Angel time
[9:15] again um again I don't have to explain
[9:23] anything here brother Owen was
[9:26] interpreting the sister with cut off the
[9:30] the tape it's on tape we have it on the
[9:32] other tape and um he uh interpreted it
[9:37] and said well the angel was first seen
[9:41] in Johannesburg before de Gloria I don't
[9:44] have to say much and I don't want to say
[9:47] much so you make up your mind and you
[9:51] believe what you want to believe but
[9:53] this is de
[9:55] Gloria I greet you all in the precious
[9:58] name of our Lord Jesus Christ
[10:00] I've never ever experienced the
[10:02] supernatural yet until this
[10:06] morning I was just sitting there and a
[10:09] sister came up and she gave her
[10:12] testimony that she seen an
[10:13] angel I was sitting there I just raised
[10:17] up my hand closed my eyes just to
[10:19] worship and through my closed eyes
[10:22] behind OE I
[10:23] saw I saw a big guy standing behind
[10:27] him standing Head and Shoulders above
[10:31] him dark colored long hair
[10:36] [Applause]
[10:40] [Music]
[10:47] Barefoot now after sister
[10:50] bubs on on the tape
[10:53] has testified and own
[10:56] testified um while she was there
[10:59] there that same angel that sister BB was
[11:02] speaking about and uh brother Owen was
[11:05] speaking about brother sh saw him on the
[11:09] platform and he gave a testimony yeah
[11:12] and
[11:13] um I just like the way brother Becket
[11:17] was actually aiming uh uh brother
[11:21] Schubert on this very issue here you
[11:25] know if you have if you have the tape
[11:28] you can just rly back and you'll see
[11:31] brother back at at the back there
[11:33] shouting amen hallelujah so that big
[11:37] Angel was prevalent and present right
[11:42] after Bubsy has testified about the
[11:46] angel being in Johannesburg
[11:49] first so you make up your mind what you
[11:53] believe and then I just want to
[11:55] interject
[11:57] here why we
[12:00] um I'm playing this so that you can say
[12:03] don't come from me now the angel of the
[12:07] Lord was first saw in
[12:10] 1979 in
[12:14] Johannesburg then I never told Brother K
[12:17] nothing then we had the coronationville
[12:21] uh
[12:22] Crusade with brother Coleman when he
[12:25] came and he
[12:27] saw that angel and his
[12:31] presence then Coleman called me one side
[12:34] it's like brother Vick said the behind
[12:35] the scenes things then he says brother
[12:38] Rosco when did this happen so I said no
[12:41] October
[12:42] month it happened and then uh brother
[12:45] Becka came and asked me to dedicate his
[12:48] church and I prayed because I didn't
[12:51] know if this was right or wrong and I
[12:53] told the Lord if this Holy Ghost Falls
[12:56] in brother becket's Church then I will
[12:59] never side away from it I said brother
[13:02] Coleman then it did fall in Becka church
[13:06] we
[13:06] have the video of it and uh from
[13:11] Beckett's
[13:12] church then coronation happened where
[13:16] the same thing happened and the people
[13:18] that stayed
[13:20] around the coronationville hall saw
[13:23] smoke coming out and they found the
[13:26] police so the Holy Ghost came down
[13:31] 1979 before deog
[13:33] Gloria 5 years before the GL de Gloria
[13:36] meetings or 4 years before the Gloria
[13:39] meetings all all depends if you take it
[13:42] 83 or
[13:43] 84 and then I want to remind you we're
[13:46] going to
[13:48] play a small
[13:50] Club of 1981 in P
[13:54] Elizabeth when brother Coleman came up
[13:59] and um what happened there
[14:04] so we just want to show you how the Holy
[14:08] Ghost got a hold of brother
[14:11] Coleman when when it was said about the
[14:14] angel of the Lord in
[14:17] [Applause]
[14:22] Johannesburg the mechanics back charity
[14:29] we pray this morning dear God May the
[14:31] young people may you smile upon the
[14:33] testimony may you see them
[14:36] [Applause]
[14:39] away
[14:45] Oh Glory
[14:47] [Applause]
[14:52] Glory
[14:56] Hallelujah HJ
[15:03] receive now here
[15:07] again this is the
[15:10] glory where
[15:13] ministers receive the Holy
[15:17] Ghost now where are we going to have
[15:19] meetings like
[15:22] this yeah brother Coleman the one who
[15:25] brought the Thunders the originator of
[15:27] the seventh Thunder Seven Virtues
[15:30] got so full of the Holy Ghost that he
[15:35] danced and I also got the Holy Ghost
[15:39] there and Owen and them said they got
[15:41] the Holy Ghost there and we'll show you
[15:43] just now brother
[15:46] SMY of
[15:48] Sanai how he got the Holy Ghost there
[15:52] now do glorious to do not only with the
[15:54] people but with ministers receiving the
[15:58] Holy Ghost
[16:01] so you make up your
[16:04] mind and
[16:07] think are they going to get restored
[16:09] back
[16:11] here and we will play just now what own
[16:15] said 40 years it's
[16:17] gone we'll say something on
[16:19] that I like to feel the Angels behind
[16:27] me I want of feel the seven angels in
[16:31] [Applause]
[16:35] them I want to feel the waves of Glory
[16:37] coming from behind me and from in front
[16:40] of
[16:42] me the last time I was on this platform
[16:45] I preach to seven
[16:46] Thunders I thought I was in the
[16:49] graveyard but this time I feel like I'm
[16:51] in glory
[16:54] [Applause]
[16:59] no more
[17:02] graveyard the seven sons is not
[17:06] [Applause]
[17:08] dead now again it raises question
[17:13] marks it was said that the the seven
[17:16] Thunder inspiration brought the Angels
[17:19] but here brother Coleman says when it
[17:21] came that was 1981 brother own is
[17:24] sitting right at the back in
[17:27] P yeah you know and just before that he
[17:30] came from
[17:32] Johannesburg so he said the first time
[17:35] he
[17:36] came and preach the seven
[17:38] Thunders
[17:40] graveyard now how could brother Coleman
[17:45] that preach the seven Thunders say he
[17:48] came to a graveyard when he
[17:51] came but now you feel the angels of the
[17:54] Lord behind it because he preached in
[17:56] Johannesburg in 1979 when the Angels
[18:00] Came now you make up your mind because
[18:03] you sure heard that they say the seventh
[18:06] Thunders uh uh uh inspiration 7th 7
[18:11] inspiration brought the Gloria the says
[18:15] when he
[18:16] came it was a
[18:18] graveyard it was a graveyard and it was
[18:21] a
[18:22] graveyard it was a graveyard but when he
[18:25] came
[18:27] 79 he told is going to take
[18:30] this South African worship and it was
[18:33] not South African worship 79 it was El
[18:36] tacle worship and it's still Al
[18:38] Tabernacle worship back to New York City
[18:42] and then what did Joey sing No American
[18:47] SP
[18:50] what
[18:52] initiated in the Gloria or in
[18:57] Johannesburg so
[18:59] that whole thing falls through the
[19:03] Met because Coleman says when he
[19:06] came it was a graveyard he preached and
[19:09] he tried to preach the seven Thunders
[19:12] you make up your
[19:14] mind everybody I I'm I got to the place
[19:18] now that um I really appreciate what
[19:22] brother said you know your father
[19:25] believe what he believes and we believe
[19:28] what we believe believe you know so we
[19:31] see it different than what he's seen it
[19:34] and he see it different than what we see
[19:36] it I have come to the conclusion of that
[19:40] I am not going to fight
[19:42] anymore because I believe we're all
[19:46] sealed off in what we believe there
[19:50] won't be anymore speaking about seventh
[19:53] and Seven Virtues if you believe it it's
[19:55] up to you but I am this video just to
[20:00] show you what the Gloria is all about
[20:05] and you know I can't say much because
[20:08] Jean already blasted the
[20:10] thing you know and real bad
[20:14] so I'm not going to blast this thing I
[20:16] just want to show the young guys like
[20:19] Vic said we're going to hand over the
[20:20] pattern now what type of a b are you
[20:23] going to hand over with what brother
[20:26] Owen says there was a law for 40 years
[20:28] yes so we don't just want the word
[20:30] restored we want the power restored we
[20:33] want the Holy Ghost restored we want the
[20:35] supernatural restored amen
[20:38] hallelujah went through aoud and so
[20:40] forth 40
[20:42] years and it's still AOW after now we
[20:45] don't have this that we see in here on
[20:48] this
[20:48] video it's only seen in alter anle and
[20:51] I'm sorry to say so if it hurts you I'm
[20:54] sorry but it is a truth that it's only
[20:58] only found in Al anle that angel never
[21:00] left us it's still here so I am not
[21:05] fighting I am showing the young
[21:08] guys the truth

[29:46] little group holding out they don't want
[29:48] none of those pastors coming around
[29:49] that's against the Thunders and so forth
[29:51] they want brother Brown's
[29:52] message precious brother in Christ God
[29:54] bless you and greetings to you the past
[29:56] and all the Believers in the the name of
[29:58] the Lord Jesus Christ trus in the Lord
[30:00] that you and all the other Bethlehem
[30:03] dwellers from the local Christian
[30:05] Assembly are pressing towards Perfection
[30:08] praise God no Pastor last week we had a
[30:12] combined Fellowship service with both
[30:13] groups of Believers here in furnish uh
[30:17] furnace a furnish we listen to the
[30:19] marriage of the Lamb by God servant
[30:21] brother rasal before the message even
[30:24] was through the Believers went on for
[30:27] hours watering the
[30:30] camel brother rasco's message way down
[30:33] in Guyana South America my praising God
[30:37] for ours on on their knees we raise up
[30:41] from our knees with a new vision and a
[30:43] determination to press with all our
[30:46] might to Perfection God is already here
[30:50] that Joseph is here I got refilled
[30:52] brother we are convinced we heard
[30:54] straight from the Throne of God our
[30:56] lives have changed we can never ever be
[30:59] the same everyone is desperate and now
[31:02] on expectation waiting for his or her
[31:05] day to be sealed away the season is here
[31:08] and no devil can stop us
[31:11] so what can I say this is before de
[31:15] Gloria and the angel of the Lord was
[31:18] here and went down to
[31:22] guania and Bless the people for hours
[31:25] there so how could de Gloria
[31:28] produce the angel of the Lord and from
[31:30] the Gloria around the world how can it
[31:32] be here it is before the Gloria and uh I
[31:37] clearly remember how dead this meeting
[31:40] was in penis like brother Coleman said
[31:44] again this is a seventh Thunder meeting
[31:47] and it
[31:48] was dead at a breakthrough and it wasn't
[31:52] the first time twice it happened in
[31:54] colan's church that the church was dead
[31:57] and it took me 6 minutes for the Holy
[32:00] Ghost to come down and visit and then
[32:02] keman came back in in in in in Flores
[32:06] Hill and said this place was dead you
[32:10] can put brother Rosco in a graveyard
[32:12] when he start praying and preaching the
[32:15] dead will rise up and say Amen because
[32:18] we couldn't move you guys here again in
[32:20] pen Harris it was dead that's com's own
[32:23] words then who brought this Angel there
[32:26] again before the Gloria and that angel
[32:30] went right down to guania the same Angel
[32:34] before de Gloria now that's why I said
[32:39] you make up your mind am I lying colan
[32:42] lying
[32:44] or was it
[32:46] lies last year
[32:49] in the
[32:51] Gloria
[32:55] 2024 who was it lies who who's lying I
[32:59] leave it to you I'm not I'm not
[33:02] perturbed anymore because I don't want
[33:04] to speak about these things anymore like
[33:06] I said I finished with George Mar I
[33:08] don't speak about him I never spoke
[33:10] about him again even if you had that big
[33:13] big a breakup and the things those
[33:16] people are saying the same people that
[33:18] was against me and wrote all that
[33:20] commments against me was the same people
[33:23] that's now Downing George Martin so I
[33:27] don't have time for these people they
[33:29] now with you tomorrow they dump you like
[33:32] a hot potato the way they dump brother
[33:34] tum down there I don't even have to go
[33:36] into that
[33:38] so
[33:40] again this is the
[33:43] Gloria the Gloria was still going
[33:46] on before theog Gloria and after deog
[33:50] Gloria we still have a de
[33:53] Gloria in Al Tabernacle and everybody

[37:52] [Applause]
[37:55] God and something told a brother to take
[37:58] another snap and he snapped to the sky
[38:01] there right here we have all the
[38:03] ministers that receive the holy ghost in
[38:07] the
[38:07] Gloria from that
[38:10] angel
[38:11] now why am i showing you this because
[38:15] this is what the Gloria is all about not
[38:18] only the people receiving the Holy Ghost
[38:20] the ministers from Goldman
[38:23] down if that don't get
[38:28] actually Revisited again then you can't
[38:31] have a
[38:34] restoration and the question comes the
[38:36] people is asking now why did it leave
[38:40] for 40
[38:41] years why is this not seen nowhere in
[38:45] the
[38:46] world but in E
[38:49] Tabernacle I don't know it's up to
[38:54] you and my
[38:58] Congo Brothers you cross from me because
[39:01] I said the Holy Ghost left what did I
[39:04] mean by the Holy Ghost left this is what
[39:07] the Holy Ghost was all about this
[39:09] happened at Coleman de Gloria class room
[39:14] right in bis's
[39:15] church and across the world this is what
[39:19] happened but I don't see this no
[39:22] more so did hlyh leave if you don't see
[39:26] this anymore
[39:28] look at how many ministers here is drunk
[39:31] under the Holy Ghost where did you see
[39:34] this this needs to be
[39:37] restored how can we restore this if you
[39:41] don't have the right guys to build a
[39:43] Revival on you know what brother Braham
[39:45] says God get a man and he prepares him
[39:50] to build a Revival on him you know you
[39:53] need the man that God buil the Revival
[39:55] on and the moment of that left
[40:00] 84 then the whole thing fell into
[40:03] chaos according to
[40:07] brother Owen Palm 40 years and I thinkk
[40:14] Owen because he's
[40:18] honest okay I
[40:21] hope you not know what's handing over
[40:24] the
[40:25] pattern of the Glory it's a hell of a
[40:28] big beton it comes from a vision then
[40:32] into a classroom then
[40:35] into uh brother becket's church then
[40:39] into um the coronation convention then
[40:43] into the PE convention and America you
[40:47] know that is the Gloria that's the glory
[40:51] of God you can't have this I I agree
[40:54] with Jean you know we don't agree on a l
[40:57] of things but when he said this is not
[40:59] going to come back I agree with him so I
[41:04] believe what I believe you believe what
[41:06] you believe that is now the Criterion
[41:09] out Tabernacle we have come to a place
[41:13] that brother said you believe what you
[41:15] believe and I believe what I believe I
[41:18] want to see ministers being slain like

[46:50] Johannesburg and he experienced it in
[46:52] Johannesburg not de Gloria Johannesburg
[46:56] now who's lying am I lying but fine you
[47:02] know this tape will be played at
[47:04] electron judgment to show where the
[47:06] thing actually happened and here brother
[47:09] even
[47:10] brother minty they lays on the floor he
[47:14] also as a minister received the Holy
[47:16] Ghost where are we going to have those
[47:19] days 40 years those days was
[47:22] gone and I stress it why did it leave
[47:28] Coleman pan Harris and de Gloria for 40
[47:33] years why never again did they see this
[47:38] you know everybody says brother Oscar
[47:41] because you
[47:42] left and that's the truth I left 84 and
[47:45] from 84 there was nothing going on I
[47:48] went
[47:50] back after I went up there to
[47:54] brother
[47:55] um uh in Canada brother Ed
[47:59] bisco and uh I preached there and the
[48:01] Holy Ghost fell until 1:00 in the
[48:03] morning and uh I first went around there
[48:05] to Coman and them and when I sat there I
[48:08] told my wife she's gone she's gone and
[48:12] it was nothing
[48:13] there when we got up to to uh uh uh
[48:19] Canada there she was again so I'm asking
[48:23] you this is what the people pick up
[48:25] because it's all I got that of of what
[48:28] have happened in in Canada I got it on
[48:30] tape too you know we'll play it sometime
[48:34] and uh the same thing happened there a
[48:35] de Gloria happened there after years
[48:38] after de Gloria so now the problem again
[48:45] is why did it
[48:49] leave why is it
[48:51] gone what type of Aon are we leaving for
[48:54] the young men so young men
[48:57] if you don't see
[48:59] this then you don't have a restoration
[49:02] of the glor
[49:05] Ever from the vision of Ken who will be
[49:09] in the
[49:10] Gloria and it was proven by Three
[49:14] Angels you know so it will never be
[49:17] proven again thank you there brother I
[49:21] started tape service bruty I hired the
[49:24] hall I paid the sign the lease I bought
[49:26] the real and I picked up the people and
[49:29] started tape
[49:32] Services now I don't want to argue
[49:34] about who bought the
[49:37] reals Raymond all that I ask tell me
[49:40] from who did you buy the reals please
[49:43] don't make a mistake
[49:44] here from who did you buy the
[49:48] reals like you
[49:50] say I would like to know now remember
[49:54] Raymond I know the history of
[49:57] ative so don't make a mistake
[50:01] here from who did you buy the reals
[50:03] that's all that I want to know and then
[50:06] also even if you did
[50:09] that this is the quote that I would like
[50:12] the people to
[50:13] read brother say God don't work through
[50:16] Mechanical
[50:17] Devices he use human instrumentality we
[50:21] put tears that
[50:23] quot so it don't help us to go against
[50:27] the prophet you can't put a tape
[50:29] recorder on the street corner and expect
[50:31] people to come in people never came in
[50:34] with a tape recorder people came through
[50:37] human instrumentality just like God's
[50:40] Prophet said so I don't even want to
[50:43] query and argue that because s renica
[50:46] told me the same thing that you bought
[50:48] the reals and I knew it was not sold and
[50:51] all that I ask just tell us from who did
[50:55] you buy the real
[50:57] and as I was saying here
[51:01] is the two sets of tapes that I
[51:04] bought for Al Tabernacle she always had
[51:08] two sets of tapes now if Raymond had
[51:11] bought tapes where is he
[51:14] set this first set is still
[51:18] here that was totally hopeless that V
[51:22] done in the early couple of years of
[51:25] making tapes
[51:27] we only got fter tapes
[51:30] late when I bought the
[51:33] second for e e tacle so if he bought
[51:38] tapes for E tle where is the tapes I'm
[51:42] the pastor of el Tabernacle I know no
[51:46] tapes Raymond that you bought I was here
[51:49] before you point number one point number
[51:53] two Raymond I am the pastor and not
[51:57] you point number three I am your
[52:01] brother-in-law I frequent your house for
[52:03] many years I never saw a set of brother
[52:08] brandham stes in A's house
[52:11] never so I don't know what you're
[52:15] talking
[52:16] about but don't make a mistake remember
[52:21] the real to reals came out before the
[52:24] cassetes you said real to
[52:28] real I just want to know that because
[52:31] that will be my last encounter with you
[52:34] with a real to real and a real to real
[52:37] big tape that tape was so
[52:39] big I'm not speaking about a small tape
[52:42] recorder I'm speaking about the big one
[52:44] the real to real tapes with the real to
[52:46] reals I want to
[52:49] know where did you buy it from the
[52:54] reals and um
[52:58] that's why when they wanted to
[53:01] destroy the cassette tapes I said no
[53:05] leave it it might come up as witness one
[53:10] day and I never
[53:13] thought that will come up
[53:16] now after Sor reica said you said then I
[53:20] remembered I still have the tapes I
[53:23] still have the tapes now any common
[53:27] sense any person that's
[53:30] honest any real end time
[53:34] believer will automatically think if El
[53:38] tacle had two sets of tapes one from V
[53:43] and one
[53:45] filed why why did they need another one
[53:49] from Raymond
[53:51] Thompson that means we should have had
[53:54] three sets of tapes here
[53:57] you never had a set of tapes at home
[54:00] never a full set never I frequent your
[54:05] house so I'm not going to query that you
[54:09] can say you
[54:10] had but just tell me about the real to
[54:13] real so that I can tell the world
[54:15] because they're going to immediately
[54:16] know who's lying you on me from who did
[54:21] you
[54:22] buy the real to real as you said here
[54:28] now I was the pastor of el
[54:32] Tabernacle the next thing I want to ask
[54:34] you if you were so great with the tapes
[54:37] who stopped the tape you you were the
[54:40] the the
[54:42] maduna I sto that tapes I stopped the
[54:46] tape meetings you know why didn't you go
[54:50] on with the tape meetings because I was
[54:52] a pastor and I put a stop to it and I
[54:56] know why because I spoke with I think
[55:00] George vuk and we checked something out
[55:03] and we realize it doesn't work nobody
[55:07] got
[55:09] saved there wasn't one tape meeting that
[55:12] we had where where we LED somebody to
[55:16] the Lord not
[55:18] one so don't come and boast on things
[55:22] that is
[55:25] invalid tapes don't work yeah yeah
[55:28] they're trying push and tape it's not
[55:31] working why are you always busy brother
[55:35] Rayman
[55:36] with things that falls to the med
[55:40] always I'm not
[55:43] fighting I'm asking and uh you know uh
[55:47] the reason I just have to explain what
[55:50] is happening why are we having this
[55:52] convention you know I think it was about
[55:54] two years ago me and pastor and spoke
[55:57] and he just spoke that he says he wants
[55:59] to host a convention where all the young
[56:01] ministers can preach you know so I
[56:04] thought to myself you know the young
[56:06] ministers will always be there but I
[56:08] mean the elderly ministers we don't know
[56:11] how long we'll still have them with us
[56:13] so this convention we decided that we
[56:17] want all the veterans to preach to us at
[56:20] this
[56:21] convention okay uh brother Tim Timothy
[56:24] said that Raymond is
[56:29] initiated this
[56:33] convention and again another
[56:37] flop another flop because brother R
[56:40] comes back he says so happy is here de
[56:42] Gloria blah blah blah blah but he is
[56:44] happy because of a flop now how many
[56:48] times must a man
[56:50] flop pure flock that every minister is
[56:53] talking about this flock
[56:57] and
[56:58] he don't stop and the people still
[57:01] follow him I can't go on with this
[57:04] anymore as I said he believes what he
[57:07] believed and I believe what I believe
[57:10] zedekiah also believed that he's got a
[57:14] Holy Ghost and Mah don't have
[57:18] so I
[57:21] rest myself from now onwards with this
[57:27] but I still want to hear where you
[57:31] bought not the
[57:33] cassette the real to real tapes where
[57:37] did you buy it from

[1:07:58] [Applause]
[1:08:33] we I showed you exactly the same is
[1:08:36] still happening in Al Tabernacle without
[1:08:39] doubt here it
[1:08:41] is and
[1:08:43] um I want to say now that
[1:08:46] um this you'll never find in since
[1:08:49] Raymond Thompson left and split my
[1:08:52] church as he had it in his lawyer's
[1:08:56] letter when he left in ' 87 from that
[1:08:59] time till now Raymond you never had this
[1:09:03] up till now you don't have this so
[1:09:06] nobody has this but El EO only want to
[1:09:12] be
[1:09:12] honest if that was the angel and it's
[1:09:16] still here that means the angel is only
[1:09:19] in E Tabernacle visible and manifested
[1:09:24] yeah I brought out a
[1:09:26] quotation where brother brandham says
[1:09:29] the good news is the Holy Ghost is here
[1:09:33] there's the Holy Ghost nobody actually
[1:09:36] pumping nobody in the pit no musicians
[1:09:40] amen and here's the Holy Ghost here's
[1:09:43] the quote here's the manifestation you
[1:09:46] cannot argue
[1:09:47] it and nobody in the world can argue it
[1:09:51] it's still here so
[1:09:56] I thank you it's your
[1:09:58] problem now to work out who
[1:10:03] lied I want to also just put down here
[1:10:07] remember brother B say what make the
[1:10:09] people dance what make the people shout
[1:10:11] what he says a supernatural being in
[1:10:14] them you don't have to pump you don't
[1:10:17] have to ask please clap your hands
[1:10:19] please shout like you guys do in the
[1:10:23] Thunders say Amen say this you know it
[1:10:26] must be an automatic thing like in Al
[1:10:29] Tabernacle they shout because brother
[1:10:32] Braham says something
[1:10:35] tickles their nervous
[1:10:38] system to yell out and
[1:10:42] scream you don't have to whoop it up God
[1:10:47] pushes it out of the people
[1:10:51] automatically and that you only find in
[1:10:54] alter eckle everybody asked for a hand
[1:10:57] clap shout and all that that's not the
[1:11:01] Holy Ghost this is the Holy Ghost thank
