TRANSCRIPT
========================================
climate change from the two scriptures climate change the world is falling apart the world is falling apart that means that there is without a shed of a doubt that the world is going to have a traumatic climate change which they have never seen before we want to always know what is in the future what is there to follow covered 19. it is unequivocal that human activities are responsible for climate change that's the finding of a new study by the un's intergovernmental panel on climate change it's the most up-to-date assessment of how global warming will change the world in the coming decades environmental experts have called it a massive wake-up call to governments to cut emissions 234 authors from 66 countries have worked on the landmark assessment the report says global average temperature rise could reach or exceed 1.5 degrees Celsius in the next 20 years now that is 10 years sooner than expected that temperature rise will breach the ambition of the 2015 Paris climate agreement and bring widespread Devastation and unprecedented extreme weather this all comes less than three months before the cop 26 climate conference in Glasgow in Scotland vital un talks that will determine the future course of efforts to tackle climate change and the UK Minister responsible for delivering cop 26 has released this statement following the publication of today's report he says our message to every country government business and part of society is simple the next decade is decisive follow the science and embrace your responsibility to keep the goal of 1.5 degrees Celsius alive our environment and energy analyst Roger harobin has more wildfires blazing through Greece and Turkey have horrified people in the region the panel concludes we'll see a lot more fires as temperatures continue to rise and Rise they will as greenhouse gas emissions keep growing and growing The increased heat will change weather patterns bringing more droughts and more rainfall researchers say London was shocked to find areas underwater a few weeks ago rainfall patterns are hard to predict but experts say northern Europe will be wetter overall at London's Hampstead ponds they've already had to raise and reinforce the dams to protect hundreds of homes Downstream from the sort of floods expected in extreme rains that are forecast to come the cost has been huge we're already paying the price of ignoring scientists warnings on climate change so this report States as an absolute fact that human influence is warming the climate and that's a very Stark reminder that it is our activities which are changing the climate and affecting these extreme weather events um and as the planet continues to warm these consequences just get worse ice in the Arctic is melting faster than many scientists predicted that leads to sea level rise which in turn increases coastal flooding the Seas will keep Rising for maybe thousands of years because the ocean deep has absorbed so much heat already political attitudes are changing the UK is getting electric cars we need clean technology for home heating too in the words of one leading scientist we're not doomed but if we want to avoid catastrophe we have to drastically cut emissions now Roger harobin BBC News Valerie Masson delmot is a climate scientist and co-chair of one of the ipcc working groups which produce the Climate Change Report she said the threshold of keeping the global temperature at 1.5 degrees Celsius limit will be breached around 2050. the report shows that in the next 20 years global warming the average temperature at the Earth's surface over a period of 20 euros is expected to reach or exceed 1.5 degrees Celsius above the late 1800s however if we rapidly reduce greenhouse gas emissions if we can reach global net zero CO2 emissions around 2050. it is extremely likely that we can keep global warming well below 2 degrees if we do this it is more likely than not that temperature would gradually decline to below or around 1.5 degrees Celsius by the end of the century with a temporary overshoot of no more than 0.1 degrees Celsius but if Global greenhouse gas emissions remain around today's levels in the coming decades we would reach two degrees of global warming by the middle of this century we joined Now by Tamsin Edwards a climate scientist and one of the authors of this report welcome to BBC News I know your area of expertise is the oceans and sea level change and in fact you spent three years investigating this haven't haven't you so it would be remiss of me not to um find out more about that what did you find exactly well that's right we have over 200 authors um in the whole report we have uh looked at 14 000 scientific studies over three years and I work on ice sheets and sea level rise as you say we don't do new research we assess the robustness of the evidence so for example for the Antarctic ice sheet we looked at the range of possibilities of the future of the ice sheet and therefore its contribution to sea level rise and one of your findings is that the melting of Greenland glaciers is irreversible am I right well that's right so there are different parts of um there are different uh Ice uh regions around the world we have the glaciers of the mountains and the polar regions and we have the great ice sheets of Greenland and Antarctica the mountain and polar glasses are particularly sensitive and we have already committed to further melting over the next decades to hundreds of years we're also going to see more ice loss from the Greenland ice sheet over the next Century over this century and for the Antarctic ice sheet there's a really wide range of possibilities if we limit greenhouse gas emissions we may be fortunate and have a relatively low contribution to sea level rise but if we have very high greenhouse gas emissions and we're unlucky with how sensitive that ice sheet is we could see very high sea level rise indeed so at my right that the message is there's no going back from some change once they've melted they can't be refrozen I assume but there is a core optimism that this could be slowed or indeed even halted or is that putting it too optimistically we think that the the mountain and polar the mountain and polar Glaciers are these smaller glaciers and also Arctic sea ice um could have some reversible changes so if we limit warming and eventually reduce uh temperatures further that those could regrow and restore to some degree the ice sheets are much slower to respond so Greenland and Antarctica will keep responding for hundreds if not thousands of years and combined with the warming of the ocean which makes it expand and contribute to sea level rise that means sea levels are going to remain elevated for thousands of years I was very struck by what Inga Anderson said the executive director of the UN environment program she said scientists have been telling us for over three decades of the dangers of allowing the planet to warm the world listened but did not hear and I wondered do you think government and people will it's a difference isn't it between taking any notice of this and doing something about it of course I mean speaking personally you know I I do sense a real shift in the in the conversation over the last few years but I think what this um ipcc assessment report shows it's much more comprehensive than ever before assessed more of the scientific evidence than ever before obviously the timing with respect to the cop 26 meeting later this year it really shows that if we do have immediate rapid and large-scale reductions in greenhouse gas emissions we can still limit warming to one and a half degrees uh above the sort of late 1800s as we've heard without much overshoot and eventually go to lower warming again but if we don't um enact the policies and pledges that we already have in place and in fact if we don't make those stronger then we won't meet that Target but what are your conclusions about reducing those greenhouse gas emissions and keeping temperatures to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels Can it can it be done well this particular part of the ipcc report is called the working group one report which is around the science of climate change and so we looked at different scenarios of emissions and what that would mean for climate change what we need to look out for next year is the third working group which looks at mitigation in other words where are those emissions coming from what are the different Pathways to cutting those emissions so that will give much more of that detail about exactly the how of cutting emissions whereas what this report is doing is showing the implications of very low emissions or medium intermediate emissions or very high what that actually implies for the extreme weather for the sea level rise and other changes in climate no I understand that's really useful tams in Edwards climate scientist at King's College London and one of the authors of the report thanks so much for your time so what can be next after covert that is the problem what is going to be next after this news flesh the biggest thing that must happen is climate change then the coming of the Lord amen [Music]
