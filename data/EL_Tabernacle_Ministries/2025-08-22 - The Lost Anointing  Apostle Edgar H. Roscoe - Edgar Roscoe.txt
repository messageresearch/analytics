TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] worship. [Music] Amen. It's good to be here this morning [Music] to give God the honor and the praises &gt;&gt; for what he's done. &gt;&gt; We are so glad to be here. Pastor John the Apostle [Applause] [Applause] apostle wanted to be here this morning and um we thank God that we could be here. [Music] Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Are you happy this morning? [Applause] &gt;&gt; We've come to fill up our vessels. Amen. picking up our cups &gt;&gt; because that's what we have need of &gt;&gt; in this later hour. &gt;&gt; We just want more of the oil. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Because it's the requirement of today. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You want to say, Lord, we're not going to give our oil away. &gt;&gt; It's the most important thing to us &gt;&gt; for this day and this our way. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's what we have need of. Amen. If you have your Bibles this morning, &gt;&gt; did you enjoy the singing? Don't you appreciate the the choir musicians? [Applause] &gt;&gt; That's what we want. We want oil in our lamps. Amen. To keep us burning &gt;&gt; till the break of day. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [Music] Can we turn to um Matthew 6 verse 8, [Music] Revelation Ians 3 verse 17. Amen. If you got Matthew 6 verse 8, it says, well, let's read from verse 7. But when you pray, use not vain repetitions, as the heathens do, for they think that they shall be heard, for them much speaking. Be not ye therefore like unto them, for your father knoweth what things you have need of before you ask him. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He already knows what you have need of before you ask him &gt;&gt; because he's your father. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We are people that's needy &gt;&gt; of him. &gt;&gt; That's why that song says he looked beyond my faults. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And he saw my needs. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [Music] And uh Revelations 3:17 says, "Because thou sayest, I am rich and increase with goods and have need of nothing. And knowest not that thou art wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked." Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; May God add a blessing to the reading of his word. You may be seated this morning just for a few minutes. [Music] I think the worst thing that God can hear come out of our mouths is we have need of nothing. Amen. The Leodian church age told God that we have need of nothing. And yet God says you are miserable. You are naked. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; You are wretched. You're poor. You are blind. Amen. &gt;&gt; Because you say you have need of nothing. &gt;&gt; But God knew that they had need &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; of all these things. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Brham says in the exposition of the seven church ages, I have need of nothing. Now when anybody says I have need of nothing, he could very well be saying I have everything. When you say you have need of nothing, you're actually saying I have everything. Or he could be saying I don't want anymore as I'm full. Now you can express this any way you want and it all adds up to the fact that the church is complacent. &gt;&gt; She is satisfied with what she has. She either figures she has it all or has enough. And that is exactly what we find today. Amen. They feel they have it. Amen. That's why those foolish virgins slept because they felt they never needed any oil. &gt;&gt; But I thank God. God will have people that says, "Lord, I need more." [Applause] &gt;&gt; David wasn't satisfied with the full cup. He wanted his cup to overflow. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [Applause] Amen. And I think that's the worst thing you can tell God is I have everything. I don't need anymore. But Lord, we want to say we need more oil. Amen. With this oil, [Applause] we so scarce and you can't find it. There's only a little bit left. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. But we I thank God for health tabernacle. I thank God for a ministry &gt;&gt; that's not satisfied. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We know God, we have need of you. &gt;&gt; We want more of you. &gt;&gt; We want more of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; We want it on a Wednesday. We want it on a Monday. We want it on a Tuesday. We want it every day. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We want the oil. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And we don't want to be complacent. Amen. We don't want to be satisfied. We don't want to say we have enough. &gt;&gt; But we want to say, God, we want more. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We need more. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [Music] &gt;&gt; We definitely need more. Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. The brother Brandon says, "Hallelujah. The God of this evil age." So God be with you. I'm sure that there's one that will be with you. That's Jesus Christ. And he can be. He's the only person that's omnipresent. And he's also omnipotent. So he can supply your every need. And omniscience also knows your need. Ne needs of what you have need of. So he knows because he's omnicient. He knows all things. &gt;&gt; So he knows what tabernacle has need of. Amen. &gt;&gt; He's only present. Hallelujah. And he can supply every need. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He says the God who is rich in mercy. All that I I'm all that I ever hoped to be, I have derived from his grace and mercy. &gt;&gt; I was wretched. I was miserable. I was poor. I was blind. &gt;&gt; But by grace, he has healed me. &gt;&gt; And I'm strong and healthy. &gt;&gt; By the grace of God, I have got eyesight. I have eat, drink, I have whatever I have need of. &gt;&gt; He never promised to supply my wants. &gt;&gt; But he promised to supply my needs. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He will supply your need, not your wants. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He promised it and he's more than able to give it to us. Amen. He says in the fallen a part of the world and they prayed for a Messiah. They prayed for a messiah. &gt;&gt; But here's what I want to say. If he would come, would we receive him or would we do like they did? &gt;&gt; Would we refuse him? &gt;&gt; Do we know what we really need? Sometimes we want pray for our desires. &gt;&gt; And sometimes our desires is not our need. We must realize that we do not understand what we need. We think we do, but God promised to supply our needs. And that he'll do. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He'll do that. &gt;&gt; But sometimes you will pray for your desires. You pray for your wants, but God will supply your every need. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He won't supply your wants, but he will supply your needs. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; He says in the exposition of the seven church ages, there are those who would not take the Holy Spirit. They won't take the Holy Spirit. If God opened the heavens and showed them them, showed them a sign that it's time for them to take the Holy Ghost. Even if God shows them a sign, they won't take the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Now, they all they are all saying and trying to prove that they have it all. They tried to prove out there that they have it all. They got the word. They got this. They got that. &gt;&gt; But we realize, amen, that they don't have everything. &gt;&gt; Or they have enough. They say they have enough. Yet, is that the truth? Compare this 20th century church to the first century church. Go ahead, do that. Where is the power? Where's the love? Where is the purifying church that withtood sin and walked with faith toward Jesus? Where is the unity? You can't find it. If this church has it all it has all it needs, why were they crying out for more of God in the book of Acts? &gt;&gt; Though they didn't have it all, and yet they had far more than they have today. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Acts had far more than what the church has today, but they cried out for more. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; They say they have it all, but the book of Acts. Amen. He said, "Lord, we don't have enough. &gt;&gt; We want more." Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Tell them that I've come to tell you this day that there is more of God. If you want more or need more of God, there is more of God. Amen. Hallelujah. Don't be satisfied. Don't be satisfied. Say, "Lord, I need more. I need more. I need more. I need more." Hallelujah. Hallelujah. I need more. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I need more. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And he says in where has thy strength gone Samson? You little seminar vitamin fed seminary born rooster. Do you only know you heading for the frying pan? Amen. That rooster is heading for the frying pan. Well, what in the world are you crowing about? See, what you need today is the good old-fashioned baptism of the Holy Ghost to preach to preach the people eternal life in Christ. For he lives just the same today as he was then. What good does pretty feathers and intellectuals getting them little pallets all dressed out here and things like that? Do you realize you're heading for the pan? And how many people is heading for the flying pen? The feathers are nice. They're intellectuals, but they're heading for the flying pen. Amen. What good does it do? What's all your intellect going to amount to? What we need today? What we need today is get away from the kind of stuff and back to the Holy Ghost. Back to the power of God. Back to the oldfashioned meetings. Back to the all nighting meetings. Praying and staying at self. That's what we need. Amen. &gt;&gt; Do you believe church? That's what we need today is more of God. Amen. [Applause] Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? Can you say hallelujah? [Applause] &gt;&gt; They say we don't need it, but the al tabernacle says we want it. Amen. If you don't need it, we want it. Amen. We don't want intellectual speeches. We want the Holy Ghost. Hallelujah. We don't want just the lamp, but we want oil in the lamp. The baptism of the Holy Ghost. Amen. We want Hallelujah. Because we need it more than ever before. Amen. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. [Applause] Hallelujah. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I'm just going to run through it and I'm going to give over to Pastor John. Amen. &gt;&gt; What What do you have need of? You don't need a motor car. You don't need a house. You don't need new clothes. You don't need anything. Hallelujah. Amen. What you need for today? What do you need for today? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We want to say like the apostle says, we need oil for today. We need the Holy Ghost for today. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. They cut it off, but we want to say we need it. Amen. Hallelujah. We need it more than ever before. [Applause] Let us hear what the prophet says. What will they need for today? Let's hear what our prophet says, what we need for today. Amen. Hallelujah. I'm just going to concise it out of all his sermons. What he says, what we need for today. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Brother Brandham says in the token, what we need today, what we need today. Hallelujah. Not what we need yesterday, but what we need today. Amen. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Is another baptism of the Holy Spirit and have the real power of God that identifies the works that Jesus Christ promised for this day. Not so much as that day, but this day. The promise that he made here. That was his promise here. He would pour out his spirit. Now he has promised it again in the last days. And what he would do. Amen. And that's what we need today. &gt;&gt; He says in perseverance, what we need today is a house cleaning from the pit all the way to the janitor and they starting over again and get some genuine faith into the people. That's what we need today in W of Bethlehem. What we need today is an opening of the word that lives not dead world but a living word that he's the same yesterday, today and forever. That's what we need today in W of Bethlehem. He says what we need today is a fresh pouring out of the Holy Spirit upon the hearts of the people. That's what we need today. In the token, he says, "What we need today is a refreshing of baptism of the Holy Ghost spirit back in the church. Not a celebration, but the falling up of the baptism of the Holy Ghost." He says the world is falling apart. What we need today is not educational systems. It's not it's not it's not lectures. What we need today is the gospel handled by the power of God to vindicate the word of this hour. Amen. We need the Holy Ghost to vindicate the word for this hour.

[Applause] &gt;&gt; He says in the world is the world is again falling apart. &gt;&gt; But let me tell you what we need today is the word of God anointed for this age that will bring forth the power of the Holy Ghost again. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We need the power of the Holy Ghost again. [Applause] What we need today is a good old-fashioned backwood sky blue sunkilling religion and the baptism of the Holy Ghost back into the church again. A cleaning out, a gun barrel straight, a sky blue religion. We need a cleaning out and a starting all over again. That's the truth. [Applause] What we need today is a God send back to a born again experience of the Bible. What we need today is a message anointed with a messiahship of Christ.

Imagine you're so full of the Holy Ghost. There's no devil that can come near you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. Amen. The devil says God is not much. He says, "Satan, this year you're talking into now, he's got the Holy Ghost in it. &gt;&gt; I can't hear you. [Applause] &gt;&gt; I feel sorry.

It's upon a man anointed. Anointed [Applause] [Music] [Applause] &gt;&gt; and the anointing came mightily upon him. that he told &gt;&gt; the Bible says immediately the spirit came mightily upon the land &gt;&gt; that this little boy &gt;&gt; when the bear camel &gt;&gt; when the moody came &gt;&gt; he says I took out my slingshot &gt;&gt; because this little boy says I fear no evil because the anointing of the prophet is upon me. He slew the bear. &gt;&gt; He slew the lion. [Applause] &gt;&gt; And this morning, Hebron, I don't care what sickness or what trouble you in. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That boy is here &gt;&gt; and he can kill Goliath for you this morning. You come with a spear. You come with a shield. That voice says, "I come in the name of the Lord." Amen. [Applause] May God bless you. Let me introduce the shepherd of shepherds. Let me introduce to you Hebrew, the anointed of the Lord. [Applause] God bless you as God's apostle comes. Heat. [Applause] Heat. [Music] [Applause] Heat. [Music] Heat. [Music] Heat. Heat.

Hello. [Music] Hallelujah. [Music] &gt;&gt; Oh my Thank you. [Music] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. Hallelujah. [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] Thank you. &gt;&gt; God bless you, &gt;&gt; Mama Bonnie. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Nice to meet you. Yes. [Applause] [Music] I thought um two weeks ago we will I wanted to come to Moapani and then we had a funeral and every time I want to come something falls &gt;&gt; and um I waited [Music] And um that the other day I told Jonathan and Jude &gt;&gt; this one day you [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] are. So, we made it. &gt;&gt; Jesus. &gt;&gt; And um &gt;&gt; I think we've been blessed already. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Are you getting a triple blessing? [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] Pray that God bless you father. &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord. &gt;&gt; As I said with the last combine now &gt;&gt; Jacob [Music] wasn't so much worried about the birthight. &gt;&gt; He was worried about the blessing of the birthight. [Applause] &gt;&gt; The trouble, the trouble came in with a blessing &gt;&gt; and not with a birthight. &gt;&gt; Oh my god. &gt;&gt; And then when he had the blessing, &gt;&gt; he wasn't satisfied. And he bumped into the angel &gt;&gt; and he told the angel, "You better bless me again." &gt;&gt; And the angel blessed him again. &gt;&gt; He blessed him so much &gt;&gt; that he changed his name to Israel. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And then God says, "No, because you blessed twice. I'll call your homeland Israel &gt;&gt; because it's a double blessing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [Music] &gt;&gt; We thank God for the blessing &gt;&gt; on the birthright. Everybody's got a birthight. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Talk about the Holy Ghost wherever you go. But that's just a birthright. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But we're looking for the blessing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That don't cease. &gt;&gt; It's there in every service. Is there we come together and uh it never ceases. &gt;&gt; So I greet you again. Nice to see the temple there. Amen. [Applause] I thought if I come over here, I want to preach on something and this is the thing I would like to preach on or maybe just try to speak on it. And um it's a thing that I feel we have to be careful, very careful. It's um maybe just a warning &gt;&gt; for everybody that's in here of tabernacle. And it's a thing that God don't pull back on. &gt;&gt; You can play around with anything else. [Music] But with this thing, you don't fool with it. And I would like to take scripture in Psalm 92 verse 10. If you have your Bibles with you, but my horn shall thou exalt my horn. Whatever little power I have, &gt;&gt; you will exalt it, Lord. &gt;&gt; Like the horn of a unicorn. I shall be anointed with fresh oil. &gt;&gt; I shall be anointed &gt;&gt; with fresh oil. &gt;&gt; And then we know Matthew 25:3 says the foolish virgins took no oil with them. Let us pray. Father, as I also have to be careful with oil, I pray that you'd undertake for us this morning. Bless your word, anointed. [Music] May it go from here to the uttermost parts of the earth as a warning. Lord, let us once again value our values and not let it slip. I ask it in Jesus' name. Amen. And amen. Amen. [Applause] If I if I should entitle this message, I'll entitle it the lost anointing. The lost anointing. Now, when you lose something, it means that you did have it before, &gt;&gt; but you lost it. Something happened that you don't have it anymore. And I do not think there is a church upon the face of the earth that can boast like we do &gt;&gt; of having the anointing. What was that? We are warned not to lose it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's why the scripture says, "Anoint me with fresh." It doesn't mean you weren't anointed. &gt;&gt; It means you were anointed. &gt;&gt; But something happened with your anointing. You lost it in some way. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And because you lost it, you need a fresh &gt;&gt; anointing. If you lost 50 rand, it means you had a 50 rand &gt;&gt; but something happened &gt;&gt; that you lost it. If you had the oil and you lost it, it means that you were experienced of having the oil. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, amen. &gt;&gt; We need a fresh Bathe of oil &gt;&gt; for a fresh anointing. [Applause] This means the oil on the old anointing. That means the old oil either dried up or you lost it or some wise crack. maneuver you &gt;&gt; away from it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And now you don't have it &gt;&gt; what you had &gt;&gt; before. &gt;&gt; Like Esau, Esau had it. It was his. It belonged to him. and he didn't value it &gt;&gt; and he lost it. &gt;&gt; Samson &gt;&gt; was anointed of God, &gt;&gt; heavily anointed. There was nobody that was anointed like him. &gt;&gt; And yet he had it, but he lost it. Somebody stole it from him. &gt;&gt; A deceived church. [Music] &gt;&gt; Some intellect got the oil away from him. And he lost it. Eli the priest had the anointing was the high priest &gt;&gt; highly anointed from a prophet &gt;&gt; and yet he lost the oil and the Bible says it was kabot Amen. [Music] &gt;&gt; Means the glory of the Lord has departed from you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Had it, owned it, but he didn't appreciate it. [Music] Week after week, month after month, Wednesday after Wednesday, convention after convention, Easter after Easter, we have the anointing. [Applause] &gt;&gt; It was ours all the time. [Applause] But friends, have we still have it like we always had it? &gt;&gt; Is there still an excitement &gt;&gt; before you leave home and need to be in the church of God? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Is there still an excitement &gt;&gt; that hey, I want to serve God? Is there stood an excitement that hey I'm a son of God? Is there still a joy unspeakable that I'm a daughter of God? &gt;&gt; Or did we lose our anointing? &gt;&gt; Is it too hard for you to clap your hands? &gt;&gt; Did you lose your anointing? Is it too hard for you to say amen? &gt;&gt; Did you lose your anointing? &gt;&gt; Is it too hard for you to put on some dancing shoes? &gt;&gt; Or did you lose your anointing? &gt;&gt; This is the hour of a lost anointing. [Music] [Applause] Samson lost his anointing. The foolish virgin lost the oil. &gt;&gt; And the Bible says she went to look all over to get the oil, &gt;&gt; but she couldn't find it. &gt;&gt; She lost it. &gt;&gt; Bonnie. Don't let us lose &gt;&gt; the anointing. &gt;&gt; Don't let us lose the oil. &gt;&gt; Amen. Every service, every prayer meeting, every prayer that you put up, every callers that you say, every hand clap that you clap your hands with, say, "Give me oil in my land. Give me burning. Give me burning to The lost anointing. You hear it from church to church. You hear we have no anointing. The church is dry. There's nothing in the church. The young people, the young girls, the young boys says it's monotonous &gt;&gt; to go to church. &gt;&gt; You know what? &gt;&gt; You lost your anointing. &gt;&gt; Church of today, you lost your oil. an elaborate &gt;&gt; while I'm here. &gt;&gt; There's not going to be one drop of oil &gt;&gt; that's going to be spilled [Music] [Applause] all. [Applause] Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; It means that you once had it &gt;&gt; but you lost it. &gt;&gt; Some slick preacher, &gt;&gt; intellectual preacher, &gt;&gt; eloquent speaker &gt;&gt; talked you out of it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And now you sit in a church &gt;&gt; where God left long ago. [Music] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You had it before. Hebrews 6:4. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The Bible says they tasted of the heavenly gift. &gt;&gt; If ever there was a church that tasted of this heavenly gift is us. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Very tasty. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Of the heavenly gift. &gt;&gt; Didn't it taste good? &gt;&gt; It tastes so good. &gt;&gt; Praise God. That we don't want to stay out of church. &gt;&gt; It tasted so good that we dragged our Torah to the church. It tasted so good that we made our husbands and wives follow us to the church. &gt;&gt; It tasted so good that our neighbors is in the church. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Is it fullfasting good? [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] and were partakers of what? &gt;&gt; Of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; I don't hear you. &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Partakers of what? &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; You were a partaker. [Music] You are not a &gt;&gt; spectator. &gt;&gt; You are conceded. [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; You clapped your hands. You spoke in tongues. your love of life. [Applause] &gt;&gt; We are the partaker. [Music] &gt;&gt; Now, for that person that's a partaker of the Holy Ghost, for him to fall away, &gt;&gt; for him to lose it, it's nearly impossible to be. [Music] [Applause] &gt;&gt; Why? because it's a lost anointing. &gt;&gt; You lost your anointing. &gt;&gt; Let us not lose &gt;&gt; our anointing. [Music] [Applause] [Music] Look where he is. When Esau When Esau lost his anointing, look where he landed up. The word of God says he went to go look for it. &gt;&gt; He went to go and search to get it. &gt;&gt; He went from place to place to try and get repentance, but the Bible says he didn't find it. &gt;&gt; He lost it. He lost it forever. &gt;&gt; He could never get it again. [Music] &gt;&gt; It was gone. &gt;&gt; The foolish virgin when she lost it, when there was nothing oil left nowhere, Brother Bram says she went to go look for it. And uh the wise version told uh the the foolish version, you going to buy &gt;&gt; and they tell you must love. Where was the love then? &gt;&gt; There's no time for love. &gt;&gt; There's no time for love. &gt;&gt; It's time for oil. [Applause] And the Bible says And the Bible says that the foolish virgin went to go look for oil and brother Bruno says they didn't find it &gt;&gt; gone. &gt;&gt; Look what happened to them. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He said, "Open the door." &gt;&gt; And the voice says, "I know you not. I don't know you, &gt;&gt; you know, just just because of oil, &gt;&gt; but Lord, I got the lamp. I got the word of God. I've got I've got the mechanics, Lord. I've got it here. He says, I know you're not. &gt;&gt; Mechanics is only the word of the spirit. &gt;&gt; It's not the spirit. The spirit brings the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So the lamp is no good. &gt;&gt; We rode to church this morning. &gt;&gt; And how many people has gone to church and they got big Bibles &gt;&gt; in their hands and going to church? And I said, "My God, look at that. That's only lamp. &gt;&gt; But where's the oil?" &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's only the worm. Where's the oil? &gt;&gt; Many a many end time believer has gone to church this morning with a spoken word in his hand and the Bible in the other hand. Amen. And they go to the church and there's no oil. &gt;&gt; Then what good is the spoken word? &gt;&gt; What good is the Bible? If there's no oil to make it alive, [Applause] &gt;&gt; look where Samson landed up. &gt;&gt; He says, "Let me die now. I got no anointing." Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Look at Eli the high priest landed up. He broke his neck and Kabot came over. Friend, as you sit in this church and you search yourself with oil and there's any wicked way in you, &gt;&gt; why don't you get rid of it? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Any wicked way. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Look on Zedekiah and Micaiah. Zedekiah said, "Micaiah, where did the spirit of God go when he left me?" &gt;&gt; That means once he had the spirit. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But now he don't have it. &gt;&gt; Lost anointing &gt;&gt; to somebody now. Who's up? [Applause] &gt;&gt; It shows you that you got to keep on filling up. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. shows you you can't take a chance to stay out of church, &gt;&gt; brothers. You might lose a cup of oil. &gt;&gt; It shows you that when it is here, &gt;&gt; you grab it with two hands. &gt;&gt; You valued your family. [Applause] Oh my God. So Jude quoted one little Bethlehem. What do we need today? A fresh baptism of the Holy Ghost. Fresh oil. Fresh baptism. &gt;&gt; We need a fresh baptism. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We're going to act like mad people. [Applause] That's [Applause] &gt;&gt; what a fresh anointing will do. &gt;&gt; Samson. Oh, Samson. &gt;&gt; Heavy anointed of God. &gt;&gt; Heavy anointed &gt;&gt; of God. [Music] killed a thousand men, stroking them with a jaw born of an ass. &gt;&gt; Samson, could tear the mouth of a lion like you put a hot knife through butter. &gt;&gt; Samson. &gt;&gt; Samson. He could coin a riddle. from his own testimony &gt;&gt; that nobody could answer. &gt;&gt; Samson, &gt;&gt; oh Samson, &gt;&gt; he could pay his debts to 30 Philistines just like that &gt;&gt; because he promised them if he knows they're little, he'll pay them 30 pieces of &gt;&gt; garments. And he paid them Oh, Samson. &gt;&gt; Samson. He could take 300 foxes. One man catches 300 foxes. So anointed is a man and tie their their tails together &gt;&gt; and send them into the fields of the Philistines &gt;&gt; with a burning torch on it. Mhm. &gt;&gt; One man could do that. &gt;&gt; How many foxes is in the pulpit today that tell tales, Amen, to the congregation until they lose their anointing. Until they found out that the oil is gone, they tell tales. Amen. [Applause] And it's strange. He catches foxes. And when somebody say you're a fox, that means you're a scall. &gt;&gt; And Jesus says, "Could tell Herod that fox. [Music] &gt;&gt; We got too many foxes that lost their anointing &gt;&gt; in the pulpits today. [Music] Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; There's no oil coming from the head &gt;&gt; from the pastor &gt;&gt; down into the skirts of the congregation. &gt;&gt; Amen. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Because it's the lost &gt;&gt; anointing. My &gt;&gt; Samson could do all those things. &gt;&gt; When the anointing was fresh on him, &gt;&gt; Samson could do all those things. When he felt the atmosphere of the Holy Spirit was upon him, &gt;&gt; a thousand men meant nothing to him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because of the anointing. &gt;&gt; The Bible says the anointing breaks the yoke. [Applause] Samson, &gt;&gt; when you walk down the street, &gt;&gt; the people will notch one another. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There goes Samson. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The mighty one. &gt;&gt; He could even walk down the very streets of Kaza. &gt;&gt; Amen. And a guazians will say, "Leave that man alone." &gt;&gt; Because if he's anointed, &gt;&gt; he can kill thousands just like that. &gt;&gt; That's when the anointing is fresh. [Applause] Samson was untouchable &gt;&gt; when the anointing is on him. &gt;&gt; They have to they have to stand back &gt;&gt; when the anointing is on him. &gt;&gt; And I want to tell you &gt;&gt; that hell knows &gt;&gt; when the anointing is on you. Amen. &gt;&gt; That not one demon &gt;&gt; could come and take a chance &gt;&gt; because the yoke gets broken by the anointed. [Applause] And that's when the oil was still fresh on Samson. &gt;&gt; But when he gave away the secret and the secret was they brought in some dead worship. Brother Brandham says &gt;&gt; that was a secret. &gt;&gt; Did you give away your secret? by formal &gt;&gt; dead worship. Sure. &gt;&gt; And the minute he gave away the secret, the minute he gave away the thing that's supposed to keep the anointing, the minute he gave away his wedding garment, &gt;&gt; the anointing left. [Applause] &gt;&gt; The oil left. Then he had a lost anointing. [Music] &gt;&gt; And you know the pity and worst part of it all, the Bible says he knew it not &gt;&gt; that the anointing left. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; They say the Bible says when that anointing left him, you know what Samson cried out? You know what he cried out? He said, "I'll go out like you like all the other times. I'll go out &gt;&gt; and I'll avenge myself like I avenge myself when I killed a thousand of them. &gt;&gt; I'll go out myself." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And I'll do it again. And the Bible says you would not that he had a lost anointing. &gt;&gt; Samson was relying on the God of yesterday. &gt;&gt; Right there now. The now God wasn't vain. They give God glory for what he has done yesterday when he killed a thousand men. &gt;&gt; And they give God glory for what he's going to do. But Samson, where's the now God? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [Music] Samson replied &gt;&gt; on a God of history. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And it didn't help him a bit &gt;&gt; to rely on a God of history. &gt;&gt; It won't help you a bit &gt;&gt; for realizing last week you had an anointing on you. W. &gt;&gt; How does it look now? [Applause] &gt;&gt; They said in the message circles we'll have a restoration of your glory. God. &gt;&gt; In other words, we'll go out again one more time and we'll show the world that that anointing is still with us. Amen. The people will dance. Amen. The pastor's wives will fall in the spirit. Amen. We'll show them again once more time that there'll be tongues. Uh we'll show them once more again that the will walk. We show them once again that angels will walk in the pillows and baptize the people with the Holy Spirit. We'll show them once again. [Applause] [Music] [Applause] And when they went out to show us once again, &gt;&gt; there was nothing. &gt;&gt; What was it? &gt;&gt; A lost anointing. &gt;&gt; A lost anointing. [Applause] [Music] Don't let us lose &gt;&gt; what we had. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Young man, don't lose &gt;&gt; that which you have. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Young golf, young sister, don't lose &gt;&gt; what you have. [Applause] &gt;&gt; They came to the end of 20 years and then only found out it's gone. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Now they wake up. &gt;&gt; We'll go and get it again. &gt;&gt; It's just like Katie's beneer. When they got to Katie's beneer and they rejected it, they lost it. They gave it up. Amen. And the spies actually brainwashed them. They were better preachers than Joshua and Caleb. They preached the people under the table. They couldn't listen, amen, to God's voice in Joshua and Caleb. Because when a man of God speaks, that's the voice of God to them. [Applause] They couldn't even pick up &gt;&gt; who's got the voice of God. So the anointing left them. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And they said, "Man, Moses, we realize now we made a mistake. We realize now that there's something short here in the church. We realize we've got the Ten Commandments without the palire." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We'll go back and we're going to take the land again. And Moses says, "Don't go." Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Just God said we must go. He said no God is not with you. &gt;&gt; He rejected it. &gt;&gt; You lost the anointing. &gt;&gt; Don't go. &gt;&gt; And they went back and they died like flies under the spray of doom. [Music] &gt;&gt; One thing God hates when you reject the land and try to go get it back again. They hate you. &gt;&gt; It kills all of them. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Why? Why? Because it's the lost anointing. [Music] &gt;&gt; There's nothing as sad as to see when a man lost his anointing. It was so sad to see the de J lost his anointing and he gave it over to his daughter. And how can a woman carry the anointing when God says she's not supposed to be in the boost [Music] anointing? Then you find out after 20 years, my brother, after 20 years, they only found out that the glory of God has gone. &gt;&gt; It'sot. &gt;&gt; Can you go on all the time and not pick up that the Holy Ghost is gone? &gt;&gt; Yes. When the ark left &gt;&gt; Israel and it roamed around in the Philistines land and miracles happened in the Philistines land where gods fell to their faces in front of the ark. Israel still went on as if they've got it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And that's exactly what's happening. And it's not going to happen here. &gt;&gt; It's not going to happen here. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Father, hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That the deal gloria was gone. Though they come after they preached and they preached and they preach and they come to the end of the sermonate and they see there is no &gt;&gt; glory and they try to sing songs to bring the glory and the glory still don't come they only become Pentecostals &gt;&gt; when the glory is gone That's when they sang. &gt;&gt; I didn't know &gt;&gt; though when they come to the end of the sermonet and they try to pump and pump and pump and pump. And when they finish pumped, there's no water flowing. &gt;&gt; It's dead. &gt;&gt; The glory of God has departed. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; When they come to the end of that preaching and they beg the people, why don't you? Amen. Why didn't you say hallelujah? Clap your hands. Then the people clap their hands for 2 minutes and it's gone. There is no anointing. There's a noise with no anointing. &gt;&gt; There's a noise [Applause] with no spirit. [Applause] Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It's the lost &gt;&gt; anointing. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; The glory of God. &gt;&gt; You look at guys like Masam. They left here. Come visit their church. Come. They don't see if the glory of God did leave them. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [Music] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And listen, they know it &gt;&gt; because they already tasted it. &gt;&gt; They come from the place where they taste it. [Applause] Samson said, "I'll go out like other times." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But it's like brother Benham says, as I said, he relied on a God of history. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Yesterday, God. has done it. &gt;&gt; Killed a thousand men &gt;&gt; yesterday. He could tie 300 foxes tails together. Yesterday he could kill so many people that you can't count them yesterday. But Samson, can you kill a thousand today? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Samson, &gt;&gt; that god of yesterday that killed a thousand. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Can it kill it today? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Or is it the lost anointing &gt;&gt; of a bunny &gt;&gt; or the second story? &gt;&gt; Don't let anybody rob it from you. Don't let anybody rob this feeling. Get some pani from you. [Music] [Applause] And when Samson lost &gt;&gt; the anointing, &gt;&gt; watch it. When Samson lost the anointing, the first thing he heard, Samson, the Philistines are upon you. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The minute you lose the anointing, &gt;&gt; the Philistines are upon you. &gt;&gt; Is the song on you? &gt;&gt; Have you trusted the song GMA more than Jesus? [Music] &gt;&gt; So can't do nothing. He uses everything God does. &gt;&gt; He tells you to take the boat. Who made the boat? &gt;&gt; He tells you, "Stand there. Let me throw the bones." Who made the bones? [Applause] &gt;&gt; He told you to drink this mine. Who made the m [Music] Now I serve the god of the mut. What does God make? [Applause] [Music] [Applause] &gt;&gt; You know why you go to a sangoma? It's because you've got a lost anointing. &gt;&gt; You need a fresh anointing. Hallelujah. [Music] [Applause] Hallelujah. [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] and &gt;&gt; oh my &gt;&gt; the first thing you &gt;&gt; Samson Samson Oh, Samson. Samson. The Philistines had upon you. &gt;&gt; How did they get in? How did the Somas get in here? &gt;&gt; I tell you, you trust the Soma more than would you trust God. Why don't you strive to trust God the way you trusted the lying &gt;&gt; dirty Soma? And maybe God can do something for us. &gt;&gt; Bring back those happy days with a fresh anointing. [Applause] [Music] [Applause] Hallelujah. [Applause] &gt;&gt; The pathetic part of it all, Joel. The pathetic part of it all. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The worst part of it all. Who's cleaned that the Philistines have upon you? Who's cleaned that? &gt;&gt; His own church. Jezebel. Jezebel told the pastor, &gt;&gt; "The Philistines are upon you. &gt;&gt; The congregation is now telling the pastors, &gt;&gt; you got no anointing. &gt;&gt; Their own congregation, &gt;&gt; their own churches &gt;&gt; say there is no anointing in this church." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [Music] Since a young man I was worried I've read years ago when deceived church brother Brandham that's the the problem when you push and play you get all the things amen from the tape and on the tape brother Brandham cries out in deceive church he says banam tabernacle the Philistines are upon And I tried to find out the place where he retrieved that. He never fixed it up. &gt;&gt; And I wonder if it is still like that. &gt;&gt; I just wonder [Music] what &gt;&gt; as long &gt;&gt; as this man is here. [Applause] [Music] [Applause] Yeah. Heat. [Applause] I really don't care about your tradition. &gt;&gt; I don't care about the salute tradition. I don't care about the su tradition. I don't care about a perry tradition. I only have one tradition and that is thus saith the Lord. [Applause] Can you wave your Bibles to the Solomas? [Applause] Can you wave your Bible to the Somas? This is our tradition. [Applause] [Music] [Applause] I was laughing from Bkari. She's a dun &gt;&gt; and a tun died and uh &gt;&gt; her elders came to her and the elders says mkari rearing your two and tomorrow today you have to come with us down to the graveyard. She says for what? He says no you got to get into the grave. [Music] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And um she says, "And when I don't do it," she said is," they said, "Then you're going to die very, very soon. Maybe in a year's time." She said, "Well, I'm not going." And she didn't go. I asked her the other day, but I was 4 years now. The other day, I says, "Um, how long was your she said, Four years?" I said, "Now, what are you doing here? A bunch of liars. [Music] [Applause] There's a sister in Joelberg. There's a sister in Joelberg. She's in the church now. But before she was in the church, she she liked to go to Soma. Every little penny she has, she runs to the Soma. And she asked the sun about the job. So the sun said, "No, amen. Just kill a goat." A goat belongs to God, but he makes it as if it's his. And you take the skin and you tie it around your home. &gt;&gt; Now the minute you put this, it's like handcuffs. You're cuffed with this one, &gt;&gt; but you tie it up skin. Yes. &gt;&gt; And after she did that, she told me the says, "You'll never lose your job now." &gt;&gt; I says, "Oh, yeah. Did he say that?" Yeah. She says, "So I'm secure. I'm losing my job forever." I came back 2 weeks after that. She's not there. I got a hold of her. I said, "Sister, I don't see you there at a job anymore." "No, I got fired." I said no. I lied. &gt;&gt; How can we listen to him? &gt;&gt; That's a lost anointing. &gt;&gt; And Samson, &gt;&gt; you can't even fool the young people anymore. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; On the internet. &gt;&gt; And then I ask another brother. He says, "No, you must pay laba, man. You must pay laba." I said, "Oh, yeah." I said, "Oh, no. You must pay, you know." So, you want the papi? Well, fine. You must pay. I said, "But dad, uh, have you finished your laba?" He said, "No, I still owe after 30 years." &gt;&gt; What nonsense is that? You stole all Labola, but you want the guy to pay Labala. &gt;&gt; It's a bunch of nonsense. We only have one tradition. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Oh, and Samson &gt;&gt; lost the anointing. Hallelujah. when his hair grew back again for a fresh anointing in Judges 16:30, the Bible says, "So the dead which he slew at his death were more than they which he slew in his life. When the fresh anointing comes, &gt;&gt; then you kill more Philistines in your life. [Applause] Oh my. When the locks close again, &gt;&gt; when the seven thunder locks close again, then you only have one cry. You only have one prayer. &gt;&gt; Lord, let me die with my enemy. that fresh anointing comes, you're going to say, "Lord, is there any wicked way in me? Let me die. [Music] [Applause] Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, then you die. When the new revival comes and the fires are burning, then you die to false teachings. &gt;&gt; You die and you claim &gt;&gt; because all the Philistines are dead in your life. &gt;&gt; Don't you feel like that? Amen. &gt;&gt; A fresh alone. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Let it get away with &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Here's another thing that goes with the foolish virgins &gt;&gt; that lost their anointing. Can I preach on [Applause] &gt;&gt; Judges 16:E 19 &gt;&gt; and this sounds like Matthew 25. It says, "And she, the church, Jezebel, made him, Samson, sleep upon her knees." &gt;&gt; He fell asleep. &gt;&gt; On the knees of a deceived church. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [Music] And the foolish virgins &gt;&gt; fell asleep until Revelations 10 was made clear. [Music] &gt;&gt; And it woke up the church once again &gt;&gt; because he says the seven thunders wakes up the bride. Revelations 10 wakes up the bride. &gt;&gt; We were sleeping &gt;&gt; in the lamp &gt;&gt; of Jezebel churches. &gt;&gt; Pastors. Hallelujah. Sleep until she forgot to get full of the spirit. &gt;&gt; Sleep until the enticing knees of the church. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; May the loser locks. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Sleep church till the power of your Nazarite vow gets exploited by Jezebel. &gt;&gt; Sweep until the Philistines creeps up suddenly and they don't know how the Somas came in. &gt;&gt; Amen. My my my &gt;&gt; run. &gt;&gt; Sleep until they bind you. Bind you with goat skins. Bind you &gt;&gt; hand and foot &gt;&gt; down at the ankles and here with goat skins. [Music] sleep until you grind in the prisons of false doctrine. [Music] Sleep until the soul must eat your last &gt;&gt; s.

Tomorrow I hear you preach in Tucson. &gt;&gt; The next day I hear you preach &gt;&gt; on the robo park. &gt;&gt; Around and around and around you go climbing. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; To try and make your doctor love &gt;&gt; around and around and around you go. &gt;&gt; And you know when a person go around and around, he don't go forward. He comes out to the same place. [Applause] Then you hear he's here. Then you hear he's there. Then you hear he believes this. Then you hear he believes that.

[Applause] [Music] [Applause] Young man, young girl, it doesn't help you to go around and around and try this and try that and see if drugs is good. See if kissing another boy is good. You're going around and around and around, but you're not moving forward. [Applause] And God got sick of it. &gt;&gt; And God got sick of it. &gt;&gt; God got sick of it &gt;&gt; of going around and around around this mountain &gt;&gt; because this is the mountain that brought the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; And God says enough. &gt;&gt; You're going around around around this mountain and the promised land is just a few days away where you can get the baptism of the Holy Ghost on &gt;&gt; the word &gt;&gt; the lost anointed. [Applause] [Music] For the latter killth and the spirit giveth a life. If the oil leaves, they bind you. &gt;&gt; Listen, the minute you lose the oil, you're going to be binded &gt;&gt; by something. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Something is going to bind you. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Because the devil make sure &gt;&gt; that he's got you now because you don't have no power &gt;&gt; to break the yoke. &gt;&gt; So it's easy to bind you. [Applause] If the oil fails, then you hear the cry, "The Philistines are upon you." &gt;&gt; If the oiler leaves, they take out your eyes so that you don't see the revelation &gt;&gt; of the token. [Applause] If the boy leaves, then hell has a taste. &gt;&gt; When Simpson lost his eyes, they were busting. &gt;&gt; They were having a party. They were glad. They got God's champion. That's when the oil leaves. &gt;&gt; If the oil leaves, there's only one prayer left. &gt;&gt; One prayer now. Lord, let me die with my enemies. It's the only prayer. When the oil leaves &gt;&gt; closing, &gt;&gt; what we need &gt;&gt; is fresh oil &gt;&gt; and a fresh anointing.

[Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] You do what the sun says, &gt;&gt; but you don't do what God says. &gt;&gt; We believe so much in a song. Now, &gt;&gt; why don't you take that belief &gt;&gt; and put it on Jesus Christ &gt;&gt; and see &gt;&gt; what the Lord can do. [Applause] You even drink &gt;&gt; the mutyle &gt;&gt; that you stole from God's roots and leaves to make the moody. &gt;&gt; You believe in the mi and the mi is not healing you, &gt;&gt; but this moody &gt;&gt; can heal you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
