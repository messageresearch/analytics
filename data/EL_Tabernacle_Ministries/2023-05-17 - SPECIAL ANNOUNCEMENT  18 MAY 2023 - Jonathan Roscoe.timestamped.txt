[0:00] amen we
[0:02] creature in the name
[0:05] of Jesus king God
[0:11] of making this clip about
[0:15] Alex combined meeting
[0:18] we
[0:21] tend to preach and
[0:24] a subject
[0:27] um
[0:28] Saturday
[0:30] or
[0:34] a title
[0:36] Saturday is here
[0:39] and
[0:41] I think it's going to be
[0:44] a
[0:45] evangelistical
[0:48] and the end a little prophetic one
[0:51] message
[0:52] remember Brother Francis we're in the
[0:54] prophetic class
[0:56] so we can utter and speak and preach
[1:00] unprophetic things
[1:02] so um
[1:04] I think it's going to be a
[1:07] um
[1:08] preaching service
[1:10] uh
[1:12] I believe Minnie's going to be blessed
[1:15] by it
[1:16] and I also just
[1:19] going to clear up
[1:23] two things that last week
[1:26] and Friday and Sunday when we preached
[1:29] um
[1:30] the celebrations of Israel
[1:33] that I feel that I just need to
[1:36] make it more plainer
[1:39] and then I think
[1:42] Pastor Jonathan here
[1:45] 's something to say yes
[1:48] um we've seen a spike you know
[1:51] YouTube
[1:53] that we put on

[1:57] but we will um
[2:00] have to ask if you were interested in
[2:03] looking at how streaming
[2:05] that we have a platform where our stores
