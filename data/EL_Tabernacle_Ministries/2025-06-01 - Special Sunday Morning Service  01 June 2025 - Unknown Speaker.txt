By that saying, we want to greet the Rosco family, our leadership. Amen. We can read Acts Acts 12:1. Amen. Acts 12. Amen. It says, "Now about that time, Herod the king stretched forth his hand to vex certain of the church, and he killed James the brother of John with a sword. And because he saw it pleased the Jews, he proceeded further to take Peter also." Then were the days of the unleaven bread. And when he had appre apprehended him, he put him in prison and delivered him to four portions of shoulders to keep him, intending after Easter to bring him forth to the people, but therefore was kept in prison, but prayer was made without ceasing of the church unto God for him. Like we are praying every Sunday. Amen. And when Herod would have brought him forth, the same night Peter was sleeping between two shoulders bound with two chains. And the keepers before the door kept the prison. And behold, the angel of the Lord came upon him. And the light shine in prison. And he smoked Peter on the one side and raised him up, saying, "Arise up quickly." and the chains fell from his hand. And the angel said unto him, "Guard thyself, and bind on thou's handles, and so he did." And he saith unto him, "Cast thy garment about thee, and follow me." And he went out and followed him. and worse note that it was true which was done by the angel. But though he saw a vision, when they were passed the first and the second w, they came unto a iron gate that leadth unto the city, which opened to them of of his own accord. And they went out and passed through the streets. And forth the angel departed from him. And when Peter was come to himself, he said, "Now I know of situ that the Lord have sent his angel and have delivered me out of the land at the hand of Herod and from the expectation of the people of the Jews." Amen. And the question is, Amen. Hallelujah. Yesterday we were free. We were put free. But what did make us free? Who did made us free? Amen. As we read also Deanomium 15 that the apostle read yesterday. At the end of every seven years thou shall make a release. And this is the manner of the release. Every creditor that landed out unto his neighbor shall release it. He shall not exect it from his neighbor for of his or of his brother because it is called the Lord's released. Amen. And we are released this morning. We are free this morning. That's why we are here to tune in. Amen. But the question is, Amen. Who released us? Who made us free? Praise the Lord. Amen. And there's one thing that I knew. Amen. It was not a man that freed Peter. Praise the Lord. But something freed him. Amen. But it was the angel of the Lord that came upon Peter. Amen. And last night, praise the Lord. It was not a man that freed us, but it was the angel of the pulpit, amen, that freed the people, amen. And that's why we can say we are free this morning. It was not a man's doing. Amen. But it was the angel of the Lord. Amen. And what I liked about this angel, he didn't just free Peter, but he walked with Peter. Amen. Hallelujah. That angel walked with Peter through the wats. Amen. Hallelujah. And when they came at the iron gate, Amen. Hallelujah. The iron gate opened themsself. Amen. Hallelujah. This is the time. Amen.

There's an angel that wants to walk with you. Amen. Hallelujah. There's an angel that wants to take you out of prison. Amen. He don't just release you. He don't just set you free. Amen. Hallelujah. But he walks with you through the wars. Amen. He walks with you through the critics. Amen. Hallelujah. He walks through you. Amen. Through the prison houses. Amen. Until you are free in the streets. Amen. Hallelujah. So it was not a man yesterday. But it was the angel of the Lord setting us free. Amen. Hallelujah. It was like a vision yesterday. We couldn't understand it. It was like a dream. Amen. We couldn't understand it. Amen. Hallelujah. But when we realize, Amen. We are free this morning. Unless we came together this morning to worship Jesus, King God. Amen. Oh, hallelujah.

Amen. Hallelujah. And this morning, we going to pray. Amen. At midnight, Paul and Silas prayed and they sang the praises unto God in the prisons and heard them. Amen. And suddenly there was a great earthquake so that the foundations of the prison were shaken. And immediately all the doors were open and everyone's band were loosened. Amen.

There must be an angel of the Lord on the earth. Amen. To set you free. Like Michael, Jesus, King God. When that angel come came on the earth and hang on Calvary, he set us free. You cannot be set free outside of the angel of the Lord. Whenever there's a exodus, there must be an angel, amen, to take the people out. Amen. Whenever there's exodus, Amen. When Moses came on the scene and he had his exodus to take the people out of Egypt. Amen. There was a angel in the land. had a burning bush experience. The angel was in the burning bush and the angel took the people out of Egypt. Amen. And when Moses couldn't go further, well, they exalted, Joshua took over. Amen.

[Music] When Daniel saw a vision of that, he said, "Though that they do wicked shall do wickedly in the last days, but they that know that God shall do exploits in the last days." Speaking of this time know what exploits is. Exploits of faith will perform signs and wonders, but the wicked will continue to do wicked. said they'll run to and through and knowledge shall increase but said close up the book.

That birth right is what I'm going to have to get a hold of. Amen. That is what we need is the birthight. Amen. Because we're going to do exploits. Amen. That day on Calvary. Now notice greater works was to have the power in the church not only to heal the sick by prayer. Cast out devils by prayer but to impart the eternal life to the believers. The Holy Ghost was coming and given unto the hand of the church to impact impart life. That's what Calvary meant. He took, he stooped, regarded men and women and lifted them into a place to be sons and daughters of God to heal the sick and to impart eternal life by giving the Holy Spirit to be obedient believers. Men who were once unbelievers be made believers and impart spiritual eternal life. Amen. Hallelujah. So the Holy Ghost is not just here. Amen. I will heal our bodies. Amen. Hallelujah.

And God expressed in Jesus Christ who was both father and son, holy ghost, the fullness of the godhead bodily. Now to the complete fullness of the godhead bodily dwells in the church. The preeeminence all that was he poured into Christ and all that was all in Christ was he poured into the church. The believer not a denomination. We'll get that in a few minutes. Everything that was in God, he poured into Christ. But everything was that was in Christ, he poured into me. And that's why we'll do exploits. And this morning, don't think about the possible. When you play, think about what's impossible. Think about the signs and the oneness. As we go [Music] over, as we hold our hands together, pray Jesus King God.

We are also making ourself ready for good big things Lord for the prophet says Lord that once again Lord the world will hear directly from God. Amen. The bride has made us ready. God's apostle has preached something in us. God's apostle has put something in us. What did he put in us? The greater works.

And Lord we can wait heavenly father to say let there be heavenly father when we can't receive nothing from the world. When the world won't give us anything, we will have something in us. Amen. Hallelujah. The prophet said, "Amen." Hallelujah. Wait till that day. Amen. When that little dog is pushed in a corner, when that dog is pushed in a corner, hallelujah. Praise the Lord. And that dog don't know which way to go. Then you will see the power that is in that dog. Amen. And one day, the pride will be pushed in the corner. Amen. Hallelujah. Praise the Lord. And when we are pushed in that corner, when we have a little squeeze, Amen. Hallelujah. That power will come out of us. Amen. Hallelujah. That Holy Ghost power that is in us that we think that isn't there, but is somewhere there. Amen. Hallelujah. There was nothing around God. There was nothing around him. He was there in his loneliness, in the darkness. Amen. Hallelujah. But there was something in him. There was a vessel of the Lord in him. And he said, "Let there be light." Amen. And one day when we don't know which way to go, when it's all dark around that mama, when there is no food in that cupboards, when there is no money on the table, when that mama is in the corner, that mama will only add one thing and is thus sayeth the Lord. Let there be. Amen. Hallelujah. We can wait, Lord. We know it's here, Lord. Hallelujah. Pastor Jonathan said, "Hallelujah. Pench yourself and see if you're not changing." Hallelujah. We are busy changing. Hallelujah. Nature can feel the change. The heavens can feel the change. So the church of Almighty God can feel the change. Amen. Hallelujah. Then we will do great exploits of faith. Uh we will do signs and wonders. We will speak limps into existence. The blind will see again. The couple will walk again. Death will be raised. And is already happened in El Tabernacle that the blinded eyes has opened. The bride will have great exploits of faith. Hallelujah. We're not scared this morning. As the apostle says, God had to take us the long way so we won't turn back. Hallelujah. Jupiteration. We don't turn back to Egypt. But you took us the long way. And yet, Lord, in the long way, we found something. We found the baptism of the Holy Ghost. We found the captain of the Lord's host. We found the angel of the Lord. And the angel of the Lord took us through Jordan. The angel of the Lord took us through the Red Sea. The angel took us through the Philistine and the Sedestine and all the enemies. He took us through. Amen. Hallelujah. When there was no water, he gave us water. Hallelujah. Oh, we thank you this morning. When when Samson fought the Philistines and after he fought, he was tired. He said, "Lord, are you going to let me die here?" Amen. And there the water came out of the ground. That is where we are. We are in a time of the supernatural because no church can move outside of the supernatural. We will have thus sayeth the Lord. Hallelujah. In a time where nothing, God don't care if it's the ground, whatsoever it is, the waters shall come out. And this morning, I am here. I am here. this morning not to do the impossible not to ask the impossible. What my five senses can do. No sir, we come from God. Hallelujah. We come from the impossible. Lord, I'm here to ask the impossible from you, Lord. We are Lord is the believer that will do exploits of faith. Amen. And what is a believer? A believer is when there is nothing. He believes there is something. And I don't care how far deep your children is in the world. I don't care how many people don't believe they can't come out of the prison house. A believer will say, "One day is one day, amen, me and my house will serve the Lord." A believer don't believe today and the next day he don't believe anymore. But the true believer is like Joshua that says, "Me and my house will serve the Lord." Joshua said, "I don't care how many giants is in the land. I don't care how big the walls are. I don't care, but I know my redeemer loveth. I know the walls must come down." Joshua asked for the impossible, and the impossible is here. We come out of the impossible. We're not asking, Lord, today for something that the five senses can get, but we ask something today. Hallelujah. that the six sense can get. We ask something today. We want to step into faith. Amen. And virtue and knowledge and temperance and patience and godliness and godly kindness and charity. The baptism of the Holy Ghost and want to go into impossible. What we think our hands can reach. There is another hand that can reach it is the hand of almighty God. Amen. We don't care the iron pass. We don't care the shackles on our feet. Uh we don't care this morning. We don't care this morning. The angel of the Lord is in our months. The angel of the Lord is in the camp. The angel of the Lord is with us. The angel of the Lord is with this people. The angel of the Lord is here. The angel of the Lord is here. The angel of the Lord is here. The angel of the Lord is hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Why don't you open your mouth speaking? You have so much faith. You can speak your own world into existence. so much of the Holy Ghost and you got one love on it. When nobody can find you, when no problem can find you. Why don't you tell that mountain to move? Why don't you tell that river to open and walk my brother and walk my sister and walk my brother? This is the time to deliver. Whenever the angel of the Lord is there, the people are delivered. The people are set free. The people are set free. We are set free out tabernacle. We have been released. We have been released. We have been released. We have been released. We are set free. Our souls are free. Our children are free. The ministries are free. Everything is free. Hallelujah. Nothing can bound you. Why don't you take it? Whatsoever it is, your hands is open. Your hands is free. Take that drop. Your hands is free. Whatsoever you need, you take it this morning. You go into it. Doesn't care how many Philistines you go into that land. You go into your land. You know what is the difference between the people outside there and you? The difference is you are in El Tabernacle. The difference between the people there you walk and you you are in tabernacle. You are walking with angel. You are walking with angel. We are walking with angel. Lord don't leave us Lord. Lord you said you will never leave us. You will never forsake us. You will never leave us, Lord. You'll never forsake us. This is the time for the angel to be seen. For 400 years, there was no angel. 400 years they were nothing. But when the exodus start, he has stepped the angel forth. And Lord is our exodus. We're going to leave this place, Lord of Texas. We got to leave this world Lord. And when we leave this world, there must be angel leading us. There must be an angel. [Music] This church is not a church for the possible. If you can do it, it's fine. Do it. But Lord, I can't do nothing [Music] wrong. Lord, I can do nothing, Lord. Jesus said, I can do nothing over that. What my father has showed me, Lord, we can do nothing, Lord. Lord, we tired to do things, Lord. We tired, Father. Give up, Lord. We can't do nothing, Father. We can't do anything, Lord. Lord, we give up, Lord. Lord, we give up, Father. And Lord, we know when we give up, when you stop trying to do something, when we stop trying, Lord, still to do something is where you come in, Lord. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. My [Music] Lord. Hallelujah. Glory. Your word. Glory. [Music] We can't save ourselves how we need to save [Music] us.
