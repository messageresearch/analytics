I want to thank God um for the year. We want to thank all the preachers who have serviced El Tabernacle this year. We just didn't forget you. Amen. every sermon preached, every sweat that fell from your face. We want to thank every preacher that left your families many a day just to go out and feed God's people. Can we just give them a hand? I think you can do better than than that. Amen. The reason being if the preacher didn't come, we would have to close the meeting in prayer and you go home. But they do come. Amen. Every week and every service. So we give them may God bless them, inspire them and pray for them. Amen. It's not easy. Amen. And then um in this the preacher of the preachers, the real preacher of of this year that preached like no other this year that gave everything till Richmond and the convention and tonight. You ought to give him a hand tonight. Amen. Can you do it again? We used to sing a song. He didn't have to do it, but he did. And we promise apostle tonight when God speaks, let this church say, "Amen." &gt;&gt; We appreciate the apostle. &gt;&gt; It's definitely God that done it all for us. And we are eternally grateful for him, his vision, this place and every service and sermon he preached to to us. May God bless his servant tonight. Amen. Then um after this I would like to thank every elder who's done a splendid job. They work these brothers. I know whoever is sick. They pray for them. They they they they go out of their way to service the problems on the table of our tabernacle. We appreciate this year every person you prayed for and we want to thank God for healing everyone you prayed for. Some of them are in church tonight because God anoints the elders when you are sick to pray for you. Let's just give God's elders a hand. [applause] They do the se calls. They do the communion for us and they take care of the baptism candidates. Amen. &gt;&gt; And they do a good job and they got lists to confirm their work. Continue in the new year and God will bless you. Amen. We want to thank the deacons for standing on their post of duty. keeping the order of the church as usual. May you continue to be on your point of duty and thank you for 2025. Every case, every weak one and every nappy you had to clean that was dirty. The people are here with clean nappies because you went out to clean their nappies. Amen. Some people are in church. Amen. Let me give the deacons. Oh, good. And I know you some people don't like the deacons, but we love the deacons. We don't like them. We love them. Amen. For knocking on our door. Amen. Then we want to come to not the last group actually the first group but the last group here is the treasurers and the trustees. Oh my did they feed us well at this convention. [cheering and applause] I know sisters they don't cook at home but when they cook for this woman I we enjoyed every meal and every effort you put in and whatever you've done this whole year Sunday in Sunday out. Can we give them a hand? They tried to meet our every need and we are grateful to for them. Amen. Then um this year we want to thank the sponsors of the funday. We made it our tabernacle. We made it. [applause] And did we have a lot of fun days? Amen. But we made it before Easter right until now with your wives. The dedication of every person that tried to give something to make every event a success. And there wasn't one that wasn't a success. But because of your inputs, may God richly bless you. [applause] And with the sponsors, we will try before the dedication to go down to Derban. I mean, it's only fair. Some people really dug deep and we will try before the f before the dedication service for all of you with your wives to go down to Durban before the dedication. I can't think how many sponsors but we will check it out. Donations made it possible. &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; We thank God for the successful tournaments, the joy it brings to our children. Money cannot buy that. [applause] Even the old people that are children that wanted to that played, it brought joy to us and we thank God for making it a success. and everybody that contributed their time, effort, energy to make this a success. [music] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You're looking at me like you know what's on this list. Amen. Then again, we want to thank God for this wonderful occasions we had with the woman's day. I've never seen people so excited like that day. What a success. And to you that was not at the men's camp, get that quote or that clip. It will help you. You've never heard things like we heard at that man's camp. &gt;&gt; Let's just give a God's apostle a hand. Amen. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Then um I don't know if you remember I don't know if you forgot we had a concert here. I don't know if you remember highly successful And the apostle says, "Looking forward for another one in 2026." In a few hours when we eat 20, he's looking forward to another one. The sisters that cook the whole year and for the special meetings. There are people here that do things that you don't know. They slip here on the side and they cook and they move. All that you do, you eat. You don't know who they are that cooked for you. Give them a hand. Amen. Special meetings all over. We went, food was provided. We were in Richmond. They had food provided. Short notice, but people are on the ball. People want to do something. Then again, this year, I don't know about you, El Tabernacle, but these media guys on the cameras, they took us to another level. I don't know if you see the clips and the videos and the preaching. It's on another level. Can we stand up and give them a hand? And the reason why I want you to stand up and give them a hand, they travel the country to record the man of God. And the reason you need to give them a hand, it's easy to buy data to look it on your coach than to travel to the real live meeting. They make it possible for you to relax and watch it at home. Give them a hand. Give them a hand. [music] And they're doing such a good job that every so-cal message Pentecostal is on our stream because they doing a good job. Edgar and Edgar and the people behind it. Amen. They doing a good job. My father says they're just special. &gt;&gt; Servicing the whole world. Apostle says they servicing the whole world. Keeping the voice in this church alive. God's voice alive. Then we want to thank brother Israel, brother Daniel, brother Lost, all the L tabernacle worers that work in the unseen every time to keep us going here. Can we give them a hand? [music] Can you give them a hand? I'm out of cater out of notes but use a spoiled man. Yellow man says kabad. You need to get one of those message pastors and you'll see what it is what you have. Let's give the man on the tower a hand. It's not just running this place. Having a vision for this place every time takes a special man. &gt;&gt; [music] [applause] &gt;&gt; Don't get happy for a man and run after a man here. Any man in the church. Look who anointing that man. &gt;&gt; There's a man anointing people here. [applause] Then we want to thank the school. It's still standing. You know you here but the whole year there's people on the sides here. A school every day every year since we started the school is still here. Not God in the prison only. God in the school. &gt;&gt; [cheering] &gt;&gt; We want to thank the principal, the vice principal, the teachers, and every worker here. They work every day to keep the school going. And you know how many made it because of this El Tabernacle. We gave up on the school, but God did not give up on. And by God's grace, we're going to open up again 2026. You want to give the teachers a good applause. Your regret, your reward is great from the school, the family, everyone. The school was never in a better financial place like now. Going into 2026, we were never all right with the school like now because God is in the school. &gt;&gt; Whatever this man, fruit comes. Forgive me, church, but I like the truth. And if you don't believe it, look at his fruit and worship the fruit. By the end of this year, we'll be able to give a full financial report of what God done in his school. God got a school. [cheering] &gt;&gt; I don't know if you remember, but God's got a school. El Tabernacle. God's got to school. And both my kids made it years ago because God had a school. [music] I don't think Edgar and Esther turned out very bad. They wouldn't have made it if God didn't have a school. Jal and Joel wouldn't have made God had a school. All the grandchildren made it because God had a school. &gt;&gt; Thanks the teachers. Thank the principal. And behind that, thank the God of the apostle. The apostle saw it through for us. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. [music] through that school and everything. Be patient with Edgar Roscoll. &gt;&gt; Be patient with him. &gt;&gt; All is well on our way. We are well on our way that apostle. We want to thank King Jesus for the bonuses we gave all the workers and teachers this year. We could bless them more than any year. [music] Everyone that is from Y tabernet the companies didn't give bonuses that most companies didn't give a year end function but God in El Tabernacle in a man in a in the leader of this blessed you though times are hard he blessed you he didn't have to do it but he did thank you king Jesus Yes, we thank God we could some places we lifted up the bonuses by 2,000 rain. We gave more than any year in the worst time. Is God here? &gt;&gt; Are you pressing stop? &gt;&gt; But God is pressing play. [cheering] That's why whoever wants to stop it will take the remote out and keep it playing. [applause] &gt;&gt; El tabernacle don't say leadership. We got leadership. And brother, the lifting up is just the natural side. How many people was lifted up spiritually this year &gt;&gt; that you can't even talk of? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [music] And then for the first time this year &gt;&gt; or in the in this year especially the people from far cleaned this place not as visitors. &gt;&gt; They slept here not as visitors. They cleaned the hostels and wherever they were the yard, the kitchen not as visitors. They told us now we are El Tabernacle. Let's give them a hand. It's clean around here because people feel that this is their place. I'm almost done. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Then at this time I would like to where's brother Lloyd Ptorius. &gt;&gt; I don't see him. He's here. But we want to wish him happy birthday. Then in a few hours, Sister Jasmine, happy birthday. The 1st of January.

Enjoy it, church. God bless you. [applause] Good evening and welcome back to E News Network, your trusted [music] source for uplifting, inspiring, and informative news across Eban. I'm Rosanne [music] Adams and tonight we're taking a look back and reflecting on the year. Now, in the 2025 World Cup Roller Fly, we saw our local team, the MBRC, make its mark with two familiar names flying high in the face of adversity. Our senior pastor, Jonathan, took to the skies with tough winds and recording a score of 54.08, showing great composure despite the unpredictable nature of the outdoor competition. And then our apostle Edah Hill scored an impressive 125.58. Even under the strong wind conditions, the Apostle's performance stood as one of the greatest representations of our region. Even under difficult weather conditions, qualifying him for recognition on the world stage. I greet you um all I'm uh my name is Edar Rosco and um I have pictures for over 20 is. [music] [music] Now, we witnessed the EHR79 Cup unfold across three major tournaments, and the finale produced one of the most dramatic and intense finishes. At the end of the tournament, Shooting Stars and Volcano were level on 27 points, forcing the championship to be decided by gold defense. Shooting Stars, however, claimed the title with a superior goal difference of 114, narrowly edging out volcanoes on 92 points. Gunners FC, the reigning champions from last year, successfully defended their title, finishing the season on 22 points. Closely behind were Loft House, who mounted a strong challenge throughout the tournament and ended on just two points a drift on 20 points. More than the competition, the EHR 79 Cup stood as a collective sacrifice towards the building of the Durban Church. Every match played, every point scored, and every cheer contributed to God's greater plan. Whether winning or losing on the field, we are all winners in supporting the work of the Lord. [music] [music] &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; The EL1 Racing Championship delivered excitement throughout the year, but there can only be one champion. Team Aston Martin stood victoriously on the podium after speeding through their final race. In terms of individual driver standings, pastor Edgar Karosco Jr. claimed the EL1 championship title. This season was yet another proud moment for Al Tabernacle and a testament to our excellence in every arena. [music] Heat. Heat. [music] &gt;&gt; [music] [music] [music] &gt;&gt; Beyond Sport 2025 was rich in teaching and guiding to our tabernacle. The women's seminar provided wisdom, encouragement, and practical instruction to the ladies of eel tabernacle. While the men's camp became a place of reflection, accountability, and strengthening. Advice given during these gatherings addressed family, faith, responsibility, and purpose, leaving a lasting impact to extend beyond the year. was featured. The atmosphere was electrifying [music] and uplifting. What a blessed and amazing day we had to tell you all. Nothing was outsourced. Our speakers, our caterers, our florists, our decor ladies, everything proudly El Tabernacle. Not forgetting El Tabernacle's Gospel Concert held by our very own mass choir and instrumental ensemble. The seasons of praise gospel concert celebrated our unchanging praise with the changing seasons. And then at the heart of 2025 was the Apostle Ed Rosco who led eel tabernacle through a powerful sequence of services throughout the year. Our 2025 year began with the sermon the mighty angel revelations 10:1 the keystone [music] revelation. The apostle then preached at the January combined meeting the gospel trumpet has sounded part one. On the 2nd of February, we heard the apostle preaching on the bess and beard comments. The 22nd and the 23rd of February, the apostle held the Bible study on the depths of revelations 10 part 5 all the way in Penda. [music] On the 1st of March, the apostle preached the gospel trumpet has sounded part two. During the Easter convention, [music] the apostle has preached the bride's Easter. And on the 31st of May, the Apostle preached part two of the bride's Easter. We then heard the foolish virgin on the 29th of June. And at the funeral of our late elder, the apostle preached after the coffin. What then? On the 2nd of August, we heard the foolish virgin part two. On the 17th of August, the apostle preached in Hebron the lost anointing. And during that August combined meeting, Handlers of the Oil was preached. On the 22nd of September, Handlers of the Oil part two was preached. The greatest sermon ever preached, the prophetic insight in [music] Matthew 25. The seventh seal was preached on the 10th of October. During the Bloomfontain services, [music] the apostle preached on the foolish church and later that week held a question [music] and answer session for the youth at VU during the November month. And on the 7th of December, the Apostle traveled all the way to Richmond and [music] preached on God's journalists. And during the convention, the apostle preached on part two of the greatest sermon ever preached, the prophetic insight in Matthew 25, the seventh [music] seal. Our apostle has gone above and beyond to ensure that our cups are running over. As we look back, it's clear that 2025 was the year of impact for eel tabernacle. impact through sport, impact through teachings, impact through music, and most importantly, impact through the Holy Ghost. And with that, the 2025 season comes to an end. This is E News Network, keeping you informed and connected. Until next time, happy new year. Are you an expectation for the Apostle Edgar Hill Rosco?

[applause] Amen. &gt;&gt; So, uh, in case I don't get to it, [music] I'll do it before the time &gt;&gt; by wishing you A graceful &gt;&gt; 2026. [cheering] [applause] &gt;&gt; May [applause] May you serve him &gt;&gt; even better. Amen. [applause] [applause] &gt;&gt; So without ado, I need to do something tonight. &gt;&gt; Amen. um maybe very contrary to the feeling that you are &gt;&gt; and um I'm bringing forth a confession of a murderer. I killed a man after 60 plus years. I had to make this confession tonight. I need to repent. I call it a confession of a murderer. And they will never find his body. &gt;&gt; The guy &gt;&gt; that I killed &gt;&gt; while I was 18 to 20 years old. I killed a man. [applause] [applause] &gt;&gt; This man was water in my blood. &gt;&gt; Always against me. stood in my way if I wanted to do something. &gt;&gt; Like Paul says, the copper smid. &gt;&gt; This man done me much harm. When I was a young when I was young, he was my best friend. But he made me to dishonor my parents. You know how [clears throat] friends go when it comes to your parents and what your parents want you to be and then they have a way to influence you to dishonor your parents &gt;&gt; and disobey [music] your parents. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I nearly turned out a juvenile delinquent because of him. I nearly became a renegade, disobedient to my parents. When we got older, he introduced me to the wrong company. That's why I know when I see your friends, I know your company &gt;&gt; and I know who you are. [applause] [music] He made me run after goals. I was quite a handsome young guy. [applause] I knew how to dress [cheering] [music] [applause] and I had them flocking after me. Brother Beckard asked me one time him and his wife and all those girls that was running after you. I said I kissed them all because of this friend. [applause] He introduced me to sport that never that nearly took my heart away because I nearly went to England. I doubt there was a guy that scored as many goals as what I have and my friend [applause] boosted me. He took me to the pleasures of the world and he drove me from church. And I said to myself, "So far, my friend." Then I came to a place, how can I kill this guy? I cornered him [applause] [music] one time. I cornered him, Brother Raymond. There was no way out for him. I planned [music] it to precision. at this place. You won't get away. I'm going to kill him. &gt;&gt; Would you like to know what corner I caught him in? &gt;&gt; It was at the altar of the Nazarene church. [cheering] [applause] &gt;&gt; [cheering] [applause and cheering] [music] [applause] [cheering] &gt;&gt; The guy couldn't escape. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; And I killed him at that altar. [cheering and applause] [applause] &gt;&gt; And you know what I done with his body? I took his body and threw it into the sea of forgetfulness. [cheering] &gt;&gt; [cheering] [applause] &gt;&gt; And they couldn't find his body [cheering] [applause] &gt;&gt; cuz his body is gone. [cheering] [applause] His old life is gone. Christina &gt;&gt; [cheering] [applause] &gt;&gt; Because I hated myself. [cheering] &gt;&gt; Oh, wretched man that I am. [applause] &gt;&gt; Who can save me? [cheering] Hallelujah. [applause] [cheering] [applause] [cheering] [applause] [cheering] And every time, every day, brother Raymond, &gt;&gt; he wants to jump up. &gt;&gt; And then I die daily. &gt;&gt; I kill him daily. [applause] [applause] &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; And I was going to ask the church as you look at this man behind the pulpit, &gt;&gt; wouldn't you like to become murderers? [cheering] [applause] [cheering] Let us kill ourselves. &gt;&gt; [cheering] &gt;&gt; and let us have a new life. Jesus Christ. [cheering] [applause] &gt;&gt; And that's my confession of a murderer. [cheering] &gt;&gt; [applause] [applause and cheering] [applause] [cheering] &gt;&gt; I can see all over the world. They say sh [applause] &gt;&gt; [applause and cheering] &gt;&gt; Never forget. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; My confession. &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [applause] [music] &gt;&gt; Now, if you have your Bibles with you &gt;&gt; as you prepare to die next year, [cheering] [applause] &gt;&gt; you came to die today. [cheering] &gt;&gt; Not tomorrow. today. to be. [cheering] [applause] &gt;&gt; I never gave you that one, Edgar, because I didn't want you to steal [applause] my Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; [applause] [cheering] &gt;&gt; There's no judge that can sentence me. [cheering] &gt;&gt; He hasn't got a body. [applause] &gt;&gt; No judge can sentence you. [cheering] [applause] [cheering] [applause] Wow. I woke up two days ago and this thing came to me. I said, "Oh my god, &gt;&gt; a confession of a murderer." [applause] [cheering] &gt;&gt; [applause] [cheering] [applause] &gt;&gt; He has no good people. He has all murderers. Yeah. [cheering] [applause] &gt;&gt; [applause and cheering] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Okay, you've got your Bibles with you. &gt;&gt; We're going to turn to Matthew 25. Matthew 25 verse 10 to find it. I will read it. And while they went to buy, the bridegroom came. While the foolish virgin went out to buy the oil, the bridegroom came. &gt;&gt; The half an hour silence was finished. &gt;&gt; [applause] [cheering] &gt;&gt; And they that were ready went in. The ones that was ready. But the bride has made herself ready. [applause] &gt;&gt; They went in. And my title is as follows. And the door was shut. &gt;&gt; I like to preach on and the door was shut. [applause] &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; I'd like you to say with me again. &gt;&gt; Let's say it together. again. &gt;&gt; Amen. [applause] &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; What a year we had last year, huh? &gt;&gt; I just want to say before going into the message, I really do not know about 2026. Amen. &gt;&gt; I try to look into it. &gt;&gt; I try to see something like normally when I come, it looks so dumb to me because 2025 was based on Trump. He had Kalansky at him. He had most of the presidents visiting him this year. He had a lot of wars that he tries to stop this year. And he hardly stops them then they go on again. He was preaching one gospel peace &gt;&gt; which is Matthew 24 &gt;&gt; war was which is Matthew 24. &gt;&gt; In the meantime he caused war somewhere else. &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; He lifted up the taxes &gt;&gt; money fail. Amen. &gt;&gt; He remind me of that second woman &gt;&gt; in the sixth vision [applause] &gt;&gt; representing Rome. Everything he does [applause and cheering] thus far &gt;&gt; is to do with that sixth vision. &gt;&gt; I do not know it looks so bad. &gt;&gt; Amen. that 2026 America will be 250 years old. In 2026, Israel will be 80 years in the in the promised land. [applause] &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; Now, I hope I'm not prophesying. &gt;&gt; I'm hoping that as things look, I hope Los Angeles sink. &gt;&gt; [applause] [applause] &gt;&gt; It is about the best time &gt;&gt; to sing &gt;&gt; because you will have the World Cup &gt;&gt; in Los Angeles &gt;&gt; next year. [cheering] So remember, I say I hope. [applause] &gt;&gt; And if there's anybody here that don't hope the way I hope, &gt;&gt; then I'm sure you're not ready [applause] &gt;&gt; to move. [cheering] [applause] I want to say even so Lord Jesus &gt;&gt; let you go. [applause and cheering] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [applause] [cheering] It will be two years nearly after the 70th Jubilee. &gt;&gt; [applause] [cheering] [applause] &gt;&gt; There was a lot of cases in 2025. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They never had such a lot of cases. &gt;&gt; Amen. indictments. &gt;&gt; And normally after the indictment come the prison &gt;&gt; sentence. [applause] &gt;&gt; Now why I say so? [applause] It's because when the door was shut &gt;&gt; in the time of Sodom, &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Sodom and Gomorrah &gt;&gt; had an earthquake. [applause] [cheering] &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; So friends, &gt;&gt; you don't have to even ask your pastor about a thing like this. &gt;&gt; You got two eyes and you got two ears. &gt;&gt; Why don't you start looking around? [applause] &gt;&gt; [cheering] [applause] &gt;&gt; And the king of England also wants to visit 2025 &gt;&gt; America. And Trump wants to give a big bash. And normally in the Bible when Nebuchadnezzar had a [cheering] big bash, &gt;&gt; the handwriting [cheering] on the wall. [applause] [cheering] [applause] And that's why I chose this title. &gt;&gt; And the door is shut. [applause] [cheering] &gt;&gt; [applause] [cheering] [applause] &gt;&gt; When the oil stopped and there was no more oil &gt;&gt; and there was no more Holy Ghost &gt;&gt; and there was no more token. Amen. &gt;&gt; These foolish virgins, &gt;&gt; they knew they didn't have oil. [applause] &gt;&gt; [applause] [applause] &gt;&gt; The Bible says that they went out &gt;&gt; to go look for oil. &gt;&gt; And the prophet of those days say when they went out they didn't find oil. Nowhere in the Bible &gt;&gt; does it say they found oil. &gt;&gt; Now, why didn't they find oil? Is because the wise virgin bought up all the oil. [applause] [cheering] [applause] [cheering] &gt;&gt; [cheering] &gt;&gt; Every service [cheering] she pulled up. Every service she bought oil. every service. [cheering] [applause] She didn't set stone [cheering] and let it pass by. She grabbed it. [cheering] Every service and now there is no oil. [cheering] [applause] Hey, [applause] [cheering] [applause] [cheering] [applause] &gt;&gt; and they ran out to try and go and find the oil. &gt;&gt; This one runs to that church and preach to that pastor. to see if he can bring oil to that church while his church hasn't got oil. How can he go to another church to bring oil and that pastor go to another pastor? They went out. Nobody goes out of El Tabernacle. We have the oil. The oil here. [cheering] &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; The oil is here. [cheering] [cheering] [applause] [applause and cheering] Heat. [applause] [cheering] [cheering] [applause] [cheering] [applause] Heat. &gt;&gt; [cheering] &gt;&gt; And while they running up and down to one another's churches tried to bring oil in one another's churches, the Bible says they didn't find the oil &gt;&gt; and then the Bible concludes &gt;&gt; and the doors was I don't hear you. &gt;&gt; [applause] [cheering] [applause] [cheering] [applause] &gt;&gt; that [applause] that same door &gt;&gt; that was shut for them &gt;&gt; was open for us. &gt;&gt; [cheering] [applause] [cheering] &gt;&gt; cuz the roof supposed to come Oh, [cheering and applause] [cheering and applause] [applause] [cheering] love. Hallelujah. [cheering] There [applause] [cheering] [applause] [applause] [cheering] &gt;&gt; gets locked &gt;&gt; at certain junctions. Amen. &gt;&gt; Of God's time. &gt;&gt; Different times in God's thoughts, &gt;&gt; doors get shut, gets closed, [cheering] &gt;&gt; when that door closed, &gt;&gt; God don't care. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. If you're a pregnant woman, &gt;&gt; he kills you. &gt;&gt; God don't care if you dishonor your mother and your father. &gt;&gt; God is after you, young child. He's going to kill you. [cheering] [applause] &gt;&gt; Because the door is closed. [cheering] [applause] He don't care which church you belong to. If you hunted with brother Brennham and you slept with brother Brennham and your brother Brennham around every corner, if you do not have the oil, he's going to kill you. [cheering] [applause] &gt;&gt; [cheering] [applause] &gt;&gt; These foolish virgins was panomites. [cheering] [applause] &gt;&gt; [cheering] [applause] &gt;&gt; And I don't care what the pastor says. I don't care what your pastor says. It's what the Bible says and what brother Brham says. That's it. [cheering] You don't have the oil, you die. The doors are shut. [cheering] [applause] [cheering] [applause] &gt;&gt; The first 2,000 years, God shut &gt;&gt; Noah in. Genesis 7:16, &gt;&gt; the doors were shut. &gt;&gt; 7:16, God tells Noah, "Come into the ark." That means that God was already in the ark. [cheering and applause] Does that mean [applause] if the door is shut that God is in El Tabernacle? [cheering] [cheering] Yes. Yes. Yeah. [cheering] Heat. Heat. [applause] [cheering] [applause] [cheering] &gt;&gt; [applause] [cheering] &gt;&gt; Heat. [cheering] [applause] [cheering] Heat. Heat. [cheering] [cheering] [applause] [cheering] Heat. [cheering] &gt;&gt; [cheering] [cheering] [applause] [applause and cheering] &gt;&gt; The second 2,000 years the Jews rejected. The Gentiles accepted it. [applause] &gt;&gt; As God says in Acts 13:46, Paul says, "Now we turning to the Gentiles because the door for the Jews was shut and it came over to us [cheering] [applause] and here we are tonight. [cheering] The door was open to us. [cheering] The oil came and made us walk into the door. [cheering] [applause] Aren't you happy? [cheering] You didn't sit outside the door. [applause] You walked into the door [cheering] and behind the door Jesus was waiting for you. [cheering] Come in and sap with me. [cheering] Come into the wedding supper. [cheering] [applause] [cheering] &gt;&gt; [cheering] &gt;&gt; Heat. Heat. [applause] [cheering] [applause] [cheering] &gt;&gt; [applause] [cheering] [applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [cheering] &gt;&gt; The third 2,000 years &gt;&gt; is Matthew 25:10. what we read &gt;&gt; after the oil, &gt;&gt; after they rejected the oil, &gt;&gt; after they knew they don't have oil, &gt;&gt; the minute they heard the voice &gt;&gt; of the seventh seal, &gt;&gt; they realized they didn't have oil. &gt;&gt; But these guys in the message, they don't even know they don't have oil. How bad are they? [applause] &gt;&gt; [cheering] &gt;&gt; But when they look in El Tabernacle, they can see they don't have oil [cheering] because the oil is here. [cheering] I claim it. [applause] [cheering] &gt;&gt; [applause] [cheering] [applause] [cheering] [applause] &gt;&gt; And I asked Daniel of Congo, said, "Daniel, could you take me to any place outside of Eltean? that has the oil. I'll pay your fair. &gt;&gt; And I'm saying this for over 20 years. &gt;&gt; For 20 years, nobody came up to come and show me where the oil is. But [cheering] but right here. [cheering] Look at the oil flowing. [cheering] And the oil is coming down. The oil is coming down. [cheering] &gt;&gt; [applause and cheering] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [cheering] [cheering] [applause] Heat. [cheering] [cheering] [applause and cheering] Heat. [cheering] Heat. Heat. [cheering] [cheering and applause] &gt;&gt; [cheering] &gt;&gt; Heat up [cheering] [cheering] [applause] here. &gt;&gt; [cheering and applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [cheering] [cheering] [applause] That makes 6,000 years. And now the door is shut. &gt;&gt; Ministers, you can be cross with me. &gt;&gt; You know I'm talking the truth. &gt;&gt; You know the door is shut. It's closed. There's no movement of the Holy Ghost. Working of the Holy Ghost is none. Nowhere to be found. &gt;&gt; You must beg the people to worship. But when the oil come down, you don't beg anybody [cheering] to dance, to shout, speak in tongues. [laughter] [cheering] &gt;&gt; [cheering] &gt;&gt; Heat. [cheering] [applause] Heat. [cheering] [applause] [cheering] &gt;&gt; [applause] [cheering] [applause] &gt;&gt; Heat. [cheering] Heat. [applause] [cheering] [applause] Heat. [cheering] [applause] [cheering] [applause] Heat.

[applause and cheering] Heat. Heat. [applause and cheering] [cheering] [applause] [cheering] Heat. [cheering] [applause] [cheering] [applause] Heat. [cheering] [applause] &gt;&gt; [cheering] &gt;&gt; Oh my. [cheering] [applause] &gt;&gt; Amen. [cheering] &gt;&gt; The other day I got a phone. I found the wrong number and um Sister Judith picked up the phone and she told me, she says, "Uh, Apostle, I feel that the Holy Spirit told me that there's a big revival coming to South Africa." I kept quiet. I didn't say anything. And she says, "Uh, what do you think, uh, Apostle I said, "Judith, you know I'm going to tell you the truth." &gt;&gt; I said, "It's finished. The door's closed." [cheering] [applause] [cheering] [applause] &gt;&gt; Shot. [cheering] [applause] It's goodbye. &gt;&gt; Never again. &gt;&gt; [cheering] &gt;&gt; Will the thunders fail the Gloria? &gt;&gt; The Gloria came with Dio Gloria Edgarco and it's still here today. It's nowhere else and it will stay here because the oil is here. [cheering] [applause] &gt;&gt; [cheering] [cheering] [applause] &gt;&gt; And listen, [cheering] [applause] &gt;&gt; God was in the ark. &gt;&gt; God was sealed. in the bride in Pentecost &gt;&gt; and the door closed to the Jews. &gt;&gt; And now Matthew 25, the groom closed the door. &gt;&gt; The doors closed. &gt;&gt; When the oil is gone, [cheering] &gt;&gt; the door starts moving. [applause] &gt;&gt; And then what happened when the door is closed? Let's read St. John. &gt;&gt; Could you read it? What happened? &gt;&gt; When the door gets shut, then comes Jesus. [cheering] [cheering] May he come here tonight and answer your prayer. [cheering] May he come here tonight [cheering] and make you a murderer. [cheering] May he come here tonight. May he make you a jailer. [cheering] [applause] Paul a prisoner of Christ. You are prisoner of al tabernacle. [cheering] [applause] [cheering] [cheering] [applause] &gt;&gt; Let's see the sketch. &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; 6,000 years is up. &gt;&gt; The first 2,000 years. &gt;&gt; They walked into the ark. &gt;&gt; God was in the ark. Amen. &gt;&gt; When the door closed, God was inside [cheering] [applause] &gt;&gt; and then it rained. &gt;&gt; And then it rain. [cheering] &gt;&gt; Watch out. It's going to rain after tonight. [cheering] You are not going to be able to sit still, [cheering] stand still because it's going to rain. [cheering] [applause] [cheering] Only in the bride is going to rain. [cheering] The wise virgin [cheering] &gt;&gt; and didn't rain. &gt;&gt; The rain came down in Torance. [cheering] &gt;&gt; And I heard they singing the world. [cheering] &gt;&gt; I hear them singing the world. Can't you see the rain is gone? &gt;&gt; Mhm. It's dry. So dry in every church. Can't you see the rain is gone? The Holy Ghost is gone. [applause] And as it rained, you know what the rain done? [applause and cheering] The rain took the ark, the word, and lifted it up. [cheering] [applause] &gt;&gt; The rain took the word [cheering] and lifted it up. Oh, [applause] [cheering] [cheering and applause] [applause] [cheering] thank you. &gt;&gt; [cheering and applause] &gt;&gt; When when the enemy comes in like a flood, the oil, [cheering] the spirit of the Lord raises you up. [cheering] This is my bride. Yes, she is. [cheering] &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; You lifted up in the message. [cheering] They know who you are. The oil lifted you up. [cheering] And they say there's no church like your church. [cheering and applause] &gt;&gt; [cheering] [applause] [cheering] [applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [applause and cheering] The &gt;&gt; second 2,000 years, God seals the Gentiles. The Jews are rejected. They don't get the Holy Ghost to choose. &gt;&gt; They only get it after we finish with it. [applause and cheering] &gt;&gt; Oh my. &gt;&gt; After it finishes it work [cheering] amongst the Gentiles. Then only [applause and cheering] Revelation 7:1 I saw an angel coming from the east [cheering] putting a mark, the seal of God [cheering] onto the 144,000, [applause] but only After El tabernacle has sucked in every book of the oil. [cheering] Oh [screaming] brother. [cheering] [cheering and applause] [cheering and applause] Tell me. Tell me, tell me that angel of Revelation 7:1, the ceiling angel, &gt;&gt; is it the same angel that you feel here now? He's [cheering] here. [cheering] [applause] [cheering] [cheering and applause] Hallelujah. [cheering] [applause] Hallelujah. [applause] [cheering] &gt;&gt; [cheering] [applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; In Revelation 7:1, &gt;&gt; that sealing angel &gt;&gt; in Elijah and Moses &gt;&gt; seals 144,000. &gt;&gt; But in Matthew 25, that same sealing angel &gt;&gt; in Edgar Ocon [cheering] will seal off the ground. I take my stand. [cheering] Oh, [cheering] [applause] [cheering] [applause] heat, heat. [screaming] &gt;&gt; [cheering] [applause] [cheering] &gt;&gt; We gave you the quote. &gt;&gt; Brother Bram says the Holy Ghost is in the hands of the church [cheering] &gt;&gt; and he gives out the Holy Ghost, &gt;&gt; eternal life. So I take my stand. [cheering] The ceiling angel in at the rostel [cheering] seals you. Keep the oil. Yeah. [cheering] Keep the oil. Yeah. Keep the oil. Yeah. [cheering] &gt;&gt; [applause] [cheering] [applause] &gt;&gt; Heat up [cheering] &gt;&gt; [cheering] &gt;&gt; Heat. Heat. [cheering] &gt;&gt; [cheering] [applause] [cheering] [applause] &gt;&gt; Heat. Heat. [cheering] [cheering] [applause] Come &gt;&gt; [cheering] [applause and cheering] [applause] &gt;&gt; on, let's go. [cheering] [applause] Heat. Heat. [cheering] [cheering] [applause] Heat. Heat. [cheering] [applause] [cheering] [applause] [cheering] [applause] Heat. [cheering] [cheering] [applause] [cheering] Heat. [applause] [cheering] &gt;&gt; [applause] [cheering] [applause] &gt;&gt; Heat. [cheering] Heat. [applause] &gt;&gt; [cheering] [cheering] [applause] [cheering] [applause] &gt;&gt; Heat. Heat. [cheering] [applause] &gt;&gt; [cheering] [applause] [cheering] [applause] &gt;&gt; Just go to Genesis 18. [cheering] [applause] [cheering] &gt;&gt; [applause] [cheering and applause] &gt;&gt; Where is the greater works, [cheering] &gt;&gt; church? Where is the greater works? They don't even preach it because they no know it. And if they know it, they need to produce it. But we know it &gt;&gt; and we producing it. [cheering] [applause] [applause] [cheering] [cheering] [applause] &gt;&gt; [cheering] &gt;&gt; Oh my. [cheering] [applause] [applause] &gt;&gt; [applause] [applause and cheering] &gt;&gt; 11. &gt;&gt; I want to show you something. Yeah. You see, I'm taking my time tonight. [cheering] &gt;&gt; [applause] [cheering] [applause] [cheering] &gt;&gt; I want to read this. Genesis 19 and verse 11. Just give us a chance. [cheering] [applause] &gt;&gt; Don't forget this quote. All these years they said they think they got the Holy Ghost and the Holy Ghost belong to Jesus. No, it belongs to us. Hallelujah. [cheering] &gt;&gt; The wise version says, "We can't give you our oil." [cheering] &gt;&gt; It's not ours. &gt;&gt; I claimed it. &gt;&gt; Nothing you can do. [cheering] [applause] [cheering] &gt;&gt; Let's read. All &gt;&gt; [cheering] [applause] &gt;&gt; two things happens here. &gt;&gt; They first &gt;&gt; smite them. &gt;&gt; They first shut the door. And when the door was shut closed, [cheering] &gt;&gt; they blinded them, &gt;&gt; never to see the rapture, the oil again. [cheering and applause] &gt;&gt; Now tonight, the door is shut and they will never see and find the door, the Holy Ghost, [cheering] the oil. Again. &gt;&gt; Again. [cheering] [applause] [cheering] [cheering] &gt;&gt; You young men see that you get the oil. &gt;&gt; [applause and cheering] [applause] [cheering] [applause] &gt;&gt; And now you know what happens? &gt;&gt; The children in the house. &gt;&gt; Amen. is panic stricken. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; They hear me preach the oil is gone and you don't have it. &gt;&gt; And the children in all these churches &gt;&gt; is shivering &gt;&gt; because they know &gt;&gt; they don't have the oil. [cheering] [applause] &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; But the children in this house [cheering] &gt;&gt; cannot be panicking because [cheering] [applause] [cheering] a champagne epic. Champagne epic. [cheering] [applause] [cheering] &gt;&gt; You only lift up champagne glasses. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; If you have victory, [cheering] &gt;&gt; if you won the battle, &gt;&gt; the wise virgin won the battle. [cheering] &gt;&gt; Is a champagne epic. Let me see your champagne glasses there. [cheering] [cheering] &gt;&gt; [applause] [cheering] [applause] [cheering] [applause] [cheering] [cheering] [applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Now, one thing about a door, &gt;&gt; a door &gt;&gt; is made to open. [applause and cheering] &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; A doors made to open, &gt;&gt; but it's not meant to always be open. &gt;&gt; There's a time it's going to close. [cheering] [applause] &gt;&gt; There was a time when the door Jesus Christ was open. &gt;&gt; Come all ye that labor and I have labor. But there is also a time [cheering] when the door of longsuffering gets some close. [applause] And this is not the time for the door to open. [cheering] This is the time to close the door and lock the bride inside. [cheering] [applause] Are you locked in? &gt;&gt; [cheering] [applause] [cheering] [applause and cheering] &gt;&gt; And a door, [cheering] a door has two hinges &gt;&gt; that opens and close it. &gt;&gt; If it's got what? If if it's got one hinge, &gt;&gt; then it can't &gt;&gt; open or close. &gt;&gt; If you only got the word, &gt;&gt; it can't open and close. But the Lord Jesus Christ got two hinges. Spirit and truth [cheering] [applause] dynamics and [cheering] &gt;&gt; former rain and rain. &gt;&gt; Former rain. &gt;&gt; Then let the door close then. Heat. [cheering] [applause] [cheering] Heat. [applause and cheering] &gt;&gt; [cheering] [applause] &gt;&gt; Now, &gt;&gt; the door can close, but somebody can still open it, right? &gt;&gt; But a door has a lock on. &gt;&gt; And a lock needs a key. [cheering] And a key is faith. &gt;&gt; And faith come by the seven thunders give you faith. [cheering] &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; Have you got the seven thunders? [cheering] &gt;&gt; Then you got the key. [cheering] &gt;&gt; Keep the key. [cheering] [applause] &gt;&gt; [cheering and applause] &gt;&gt; You can open the door. [cheering] [cheering] &gt;&gt; And you can [cheering] [applause] &gt;&gt; [cheering] [applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [applause and cheering] Hallelujah. [cheering] &gt;&gt; Oh my. [applause] &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; My my [applause] [cheering] hallelujah. [applause and cheering] Hallelujah. [cheering] [applause] &gt;&gt; [applause] [cheering] [applause and cheering] &gt;&gt; And then the bridegroom says to her, &gt;&gt; "Come in. &gt;&gt; Come in." Amen. &gt;&gt; While the door was closed to the foolish version, &gt;&gt; Revelations 4:1 says there's a door open in heaven for the bride. [applause] &gt;&gt; And a voice says, "Come up higher." Brian, [cheering] [applause] &gt;&gt; El Tabernacle, &gt;&gt; come up higher. [cheering] Come up higher. [cheering and applause] [applause] &gt;&gt; And yellow is a mystery. &gt;&gt; And he says, "Come in." Now, how could you go in to the wedding supper with this flesh body? &gt;&gt; That means they had a body change. [cheering and applause] &gt;&gt; Before they could go in, &gt;&gt; their body changed. [cheering] [applause] You had a body change [cheering] &gt;&gt; for you killed that old man &gt;&gt; and now you have a body change. &gt;&gt; Your body changed. [cheering] The things you used to do, you do them no more. [cheering] You had a body change. You had a body change. You don't like nice times anymore &gt;&gt; because the night times now lay behind the door. [cheering] [applause] &gt;&gt; Come on now. Come on now. Come on out. [cheering] [applause] Right here in verse 10. The voice and the trumpet took place &gt;&gt; and they changed &gt;&gt; and then they went in cuz they can't go in with their bodies. &gt;&gt; Flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God. &gt;&gt; So I show you a mystery here [applause and cheering] that the wise virgin went in. But you know, &gt;&gt; there was one of the foolish virgins that slipped in with him. &gt;&gt; She look alike &gt;&gt; in every way and she slipped in. How? Nobody knows. But she was in the wedding. Every now and then they slip in. Yeah. [applause] &gt;&gt; [applause] [applause] &gt;&gt; And the bridegroom said to her, "Friend, &gt;&gt; what are you doing here in E Tabernacle? &gt;&gt; You didn't come from Raymond Thompson. &gt;&gt; What do you want here? We see you don't have the your Gloria garment on. [applause] [cheering] &gt;&gt; Get out [applause] [cheering] [applause] friends. and the door was shut. &gt;&gt; I'm going to leave the rest of the message [cheering] &gt;&gt; and the door tonight [cheering and applause] is shut. [cheering] [applause] &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; Will the pianos come? [applause] &gt;&gt; Is there anybody here that needs the wedding garment? &gt;&gt; Is there anybody here that needs more? [cheering] Now, let's call on the Lord. &gt;&gt; Call on him. Cuz when the door is shut, [cheering] he's standing right next to you now. [applause] [cheering] [applause] &gt;&gt; [cheering] &gt;&gt; You speak to him. [applause] [cheering] [applause and cheering] &gt;&gt; [applause] [cheering] &gt;&gt; as the oil is leaving Al tabernacle and going over to Gaza [applause] where the Jews are finishing the thing off. [applause] Let us keep the oil. [cheering] &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; I'm finished. [applause] [applause] &gt;&gt; [applause] [cheering] [applause] &gt;&gt; Everybody. Come &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; on. [applause] Come on. [applause] [applause] &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. [applause] [applause] Heat. Heat. [applause] [applause] [applause] Amen.

[applause] &gt;&gt; [applause] [music] [applause] [music] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [music] Lord, [music] [applause] [music] [music] thank you. [applause] &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; as I finish off this meeting. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Remember, &gt;&gt; more than 20 years ago, &gt;&gt; I told you the Holy Ghost is gone. And now I come back to show you the sequence. If the Holy Ghost leaves, the door gets shut. [applause] [music] &gt;&gt; And now the door is shut. &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; If that door shuts and you still a sinner, you're never going to be saved. Your day is gone. Cuz he shuts the door and you can't find the door no more. You can't even save your children's soul. The foolish virgin said a half an hour to fill up and it didn't fill up. And then the Holy Ghost leaves them and heaven's door shuts. All these years it was just open as much as that &gt;&gt; and you could only go in like a crab like this. Now it's closed. It's gone. But brother Oscar, what about them that's still coming? God's got his talked away that never heard the gospel. But you that hear the gospel. Goodbye. [applause] I hope I'm wrong, but up till now I am not. And the door is shut. It's closed. We going to be able to pick up one here and one there and one there. As I said, the door Jesus is not going to be always open. He closes the door. That's why I came with that little story. A murderous confession. &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; We can only kill ourselves and beg for mercy. You oldtimes that's been so long with us. Watch that the devil don't trick you against the ministry. &gt;&gt; Amen. [applause] Don't get too big for your boots [applause] because the door is closed. You'll never come in back again. Two years ago, we spoke on the 70th Jubilee and the church was packed with vacciners. You remember how many of them could make it? None. None. And how bad is it going to be now when the door is shut? And this is where the foolish virgin made her biggest mistake. We put it on. You're doing what you are told, foolish virgin, but not doing what's right. Your pastors told you a lot of things that's not scriptural. And you were doing what was what they told you, but you didn't do what God said. You do what your girlfriend told you, but you didn't do what is right. Amen. &gt;&gt; Young girl, you're running after flesh and you don't even know it's time to drop the flesh, to kill the flesh. It's time that you search yourself before we go into this new year. A thing that I hate that I see in our tabernacle is these young children that wants to tell their parents what to do. Found a sister from Cape Town. says the child want to go home. Send the deacons over there. The child was under drugs pressing her. She must go home. Since when do we hear listen to children? When Gersian didn't listen, I kicked him out. Al tabernacle don't listen to children. Children listens to us. &gt;&gt; [applause] [applause] &gt;&gt; They do what they told from their friends, but they don't do what is right. It's time we do what is right. [applause] Search me. [applause] Oh Lord, I told a sister the other day, take your heart off your child cuz you're going to lose your soul, too. stubborn. And now it's nearly impossible for you to come back. You struggled with your boy all the years cuz you patched him up. How does he look tonight? How is he looking tonight? It's no time to patch up. Son or no son, kick him out. [applause] [music] If Job, Noah, Daniel had to live in this [music] day tonight, they could only save their own souls. Can't save your children's souls. They want to go to hell. I told Gersian, "When you open your eyes, you saw me here. And when you close [music] this eyes, you're going to find me here. &gt;&gt; [applause] [music] &gt;&gt; You're too nice with your children because you think if you're so nice [music] that's love. That's not love. That's compromise. Because it's your child. I don't know how many people, deacons even that was with me, that straightened out all the other people's children. When it came to theirs, they couldn't straighten them out. They left with their children and they backsliden with their children. Only thing that helps is God's word. [applause] [music] [applause] Search me. Stop looking at your child. Look at Jesus. If you don't act like Jesus is not worthy to be your boy. [applause] Wouldn't you like to kill yourself tonight? [music] &gt;&gt; [music] [music] &gt;&gt; Is there any wicked ways still to live in you? [singing] &gt;&gt; Let's kill that wicked way tonight. [music] &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Let's commit suicide. [music] &gt;&gt; [applause and music] [music] &gt;&gt; God bless you. [music] &gt;&gt; And the doors [music] are shut. And the wise virgin says, "I [music] cannot give you any oil. I just got enough for myself." Brother Oscar, why don't you [music] go to the other churches and help them? I already done it. Here's the flags hanging. They didn't want it. [music and applause] Look at all those flags. But on every flag there's a tape. And now I cannot do it no more because the [music] door is shut. Brother Jonathan &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Let [music] [singing] me see. Amen. [music] &gt;&gt; [music] [music] &gt;&gt; Search [singing] me, [music] oh God, and [music] all [singing] my today. [music] [singing] Oh, [music] save. [singing] Oh [music and singing] my go [music] see [music] the be some [music and singing] Bring the light in me. [singing and music] Amen. [singing] Set [music] me free. [music] Heat. Heat. [music] Heat. Heat. [music] Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. [music] [music] Heat. Heat. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Heat. Heat. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Is there anybody? It says this was for me, not for somebody next to you. Your apostle spoke to me. Is there anybody like that? Not someone else is the target. I'm the target. It was directly to my kill myself. There's people at the altar. &gt;&gt; There's people killing themselves. That way it be and Oh son. Oh God, [music] my heart [music] for we're going to take communion tonight. the crossing over tonight. Is there anyone that examined themselves or was it just somebody else? You felt, "No, that's not for me. Somebody else." But before we take the communion, are you examining what the man said? I beg you to ask him &gt;&gt; who was talking to us tonight. &gt;&gt; Is there a young girl that is rude to her parents? Are you examining yourself? Oh, tonight I realize God's spirit not going to strive with any man anymore. [singing] God is not going to strive anymore. You heard he strived all the time. Is there anyone here? Why are you okay?

I wonder precious brother Ignatius come to read us the scripture for the communion. Amen. As we turn to our scripture, scripture, turn to 1 Corinthians chapter 11, reading from verse 23 to 34. If you have it, it reads as follows. For I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you, that the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed, [music] he took bread, and when he had given thanks, he broke it and said, "Take it. This is my body which is broken for you. This give [screaming] me remembrance of me. After the same manner also he took the cup. [crying] When he has supper, saying, "This cup is the new testament in my blood. This do you as often as you drink it in remembrance of me. For as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup, it will show the Lord's death till he come. Wherefore, whoever shall eat this bread and drink it this cup of the Lord [music] unworthily shall be guilty of the body in the blood of the Lord. But let a man examine himself, and so [music] let him of that bread and drink of that cup. For he that eateth and drinkketh unworthily eateth and drinkketh damnation to himself, not discerning the Lord's body. For this cause many are weak and sickly among you, and many sleep. For if we would judge ourselves, we should not be judged. But when we are just, we are chasing of the Lord that we should not be condemned with the world. Wherefore my brethren, when you come together to eat [music] tar for one another, and if any man hunger, let him eat at home, that you come not together unto condemnation, and the rest [music] will I set in order when I come. We just take moment of silence as we examine ourselves. Amen. I want to ask brotherly to come and pray for the Lord's table. Amen. Amen. Thank you Lord Jesus. Thank you blessed savior. Father, it's with a humble heart. Father, it's with a contrite spirit, Lord, that we bow before thee this evening, Lord, we want to say thank you, Lord. Thank you, Lord, that we are behind the shut door, Lord Jesus. Father, for where you have kept us, Lord. [applause] Father, Lord, we want to say thank you. Thank you, Lord Jesus.

Father, Lord, that it will keep us, Lord. And the apostles said, Lord, Father, that it will keep us, Lord, in this day, Lord Jesus. May you bless the table, Lord. Father, Lord Jesus, as we Lord, partake, Lord, and as we've examined ourselves, Lord, that we will not partake unworthily, Lord Jesus, but Lord, that we've examined ourselves, Lord, Father, Lord Jesus, may you come and have your way now, Lord, and bless this table, we ask it in Jesus precious and mighty name with much praise and thanksgiving. Amen. And amen. [applause] Amen. We're going to start with the communion. We're going to do it rowbyrow and we request that everybody be reverent.

Oh God, Lord, we're so thankful, heavenly father, Lord, that you brought us thus far. And we're so thankful, Lord, that you sent an angel our way, heavenly father. Lord, when we look back to 2025, we started the year with a mighty angel. And we're so thankful, Lord God, that that mighty angels could keep their doors open for El Tabernacle for us to cross over in to the higher calling this evening. Heavenly Father, Lord, thank you, Lord, for an upward pool, oh God, that could pull us in through the door. Heavenly Father, Lord, we're so thankful that we could be part of you and your beautiful kingdom this evening. Heavenly Father, Lord, thank you so much for the man that is the pinnacle of prophecies to the Gentile dispensation. Oh God, Lord, when we look back to 2025, we can see, Lord, that surely you've been Jehovah Gyra, the Lord our provider. Lord, you've been Jehovah Shama, the everpresent help in the time of trouble and trials. Oh God, we're so thankful, Lord, that we've seen you in different attributes and different ways throughout this year. Oh God, and we're so thankful, oh God, that in El Tabernacle, we know you as Jehovah Rosco, the manifestation of God in flesh. Lord, thank you, Lord, for coming down our way to open the way to open the door. Heavenly Father, and to call us into the beloved of the Lord. Thank you for opening the door for us, heavenly father. Lord, that we can be in the joy of the Lord. Heavenly Father, Lord, we're so thankful for everything you've done for us, Lord. And Lord, as we depart, Lord, may your spirit go and prepare the way for those that will be traveling, Lord, to our respective homes. Heavenly Father, Lord, may that same angel that started last year, that started this year, Lord God, may he go with us as he shut us into the Shakina glory, as he shut us into the Aoya of God, may that Aoya that we were shut into move heavenly father, Lord, and protect us as we leave to our respective homes, oh God.
