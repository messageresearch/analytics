[43:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:04] &gt;&gt; We're together again.
[44:24] It was so beautiful.
[44:28] I was sitting in the car
[44:31] and I watched
[44:34] all the sisters was trickling into this
[44:37] place
[44:41] and it's been such a beautiful scene for
[44:44] Hey,
[44:51] [applause]
[44:56] [applause]
[44:59] they
[45:02] they look like angels.
[45:07] [applause]
[45:13] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[45:14] &gt;&gt; moving to
[45:16] a specific place
[45:20] and I
[45:22] said to myself,
[45:25] it had come
[45:30] it was not in vain.
[45:35] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[45:47] &gt;&gt; My loving
[45:51] is not in vain.
[45:54] &gt;&gt; I
[46:03] I thought as the
[46:07] marched in here.
[46:11] I thought when
[46:15] the devil look over the benister of his
[46:19] domain
[46:22] and they look at them,
[46:25] I wonder what does he think?
[46:31] I'm sure
[46:34] He must be jealous, you know.
[46:38] [applause]
[46:49] Because
[46:51] this is just a different bunch.
[46:57] Not the same people.
[47:03] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[47:07] &gt;&gt; So um tonight this question and answer
[47:10] is not so much preaching.
[47:14] Sometimes wonder why we have things like
[47:16] this but they sang the song. Yeah.
[47:21] Jesus is the answer.
[47:29] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[47:35] [applause]
[47:38] &gt;&gt; And we are the question.
[47:44] We got so many questions.
[47:48] So I'm so glad that he is the answer.
[47:58] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[48:04] &gt;&gt; Because before there could be a
[48:05] question,
[48:09] &gt;&gt; there had to be an answer.
[48:20] [applause]
[48:23] So, the university students
[48:27] threw up some questions that we're going
[48:28] to answer tonight
[48:31] because we believe that
[48:37] he is the king of El Tabernacle.
[48:45] [applause]
[48:50] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[48:53] &gt;&gt; and he wants to answer you.
[48:57] So let us just bow our eyes and
[49:01] look towards him.
[49:03] Our heavenly father,
[49:08] I think it's Paul that says
[49:13] he's the greatest,
[49:16] the chiefest sinner of them all.
[49:20] We come to you if we failed you
[49:25] during the course of this day.
[49:28] May you forgive us
[49:31] what we thought
[49:35] and whatever we done that don't satisfy
[49:39] you.
[49:44] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[49:49] &gt;&gt; in thought, word, and deed.
[49:53] Forgive us.
[49:55] We are here tonight
[49:59] because there's questions.
[50:06] Lord, for every question [applause]
[50:09] there's an answer
[50:12] because Jesus is the answer.
[50:17] [applause]
[50:24] I do pray
[50:26] that you would bless your children here,
[50:31] the ones you washed in your blood.
[50:35] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[50:41] &gt;&gt; that we could come out on a Thursday
[50:43] night
[50:45] and have church.
[50:48] So we love church Lord.
[50:52] May you further undertake for us
[50:55] [applause]
[50:57] in Jesus name. You may be seated
[51:02] now.
[51:05] We sorry for the brethren that stands
[51:11] around
[51:13] the hallway. Yeah.
[51:17] We didn't think it's going to be packed
[51:19] like this.
[51:22] Um
[51:24] we were just
[51:26] coming to the university students
[51:30] and um
[51:33] but um
[51:36] it is not what it is.
[51:39] So please just let your hair down
[51:42] and don't look at me as if I come from
[51:46] I do come from space.
[51:55] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[51:59] &gt;&gt; But I'm with you for a long time now.
[52:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:05] So, um,
[52:07] just do me a favor. Turn around and just
[52:11] tell the one next to you,
[52:14] just cool it, my brother. Everything is
[52:16] fine.

[53:11] than sitting in El Tabernacle.

[56:09] Why
[56:11] can't I get an auntie?
[56:16] Question, question, question.
[56:21] And that's a part of our life.
[56:26] Since you know yourself,
[56:28] you have questions.
[56:32] And one thing I notice about God,
