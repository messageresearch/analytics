[41:35] time
[41:38] but but I feel to say something about
[41:43] Billy
[41:45] Paul you may be

[43:19] very very
[43:20] young and brother Bram tells you how he
[43:23] had to carry bully all over and keep the
[43:28] bottle here in
[43:31] his to keep it warm for Bully to
[43:35] drink so bully was without a mother
[43:38] since a young young
[43:41] age and Sarah Rose also died Bully's
[43:46] only
[43:49] sister died at the same time sister hope
[43:54] died and
[44:00] brother brandham didn't want to marry
[44:04] again and the angel of the Lord told him
[44:06] because of the days are so
[44:09] bad that um woman has gone on the
[44:15] Rampage he says You must get
[44:19] married and while God was speaking to
[44:21] him God was speaking
[44:23] to his second wife
[44:26] and he told his second
[44:28] wife behold I'll send you
[44:32] [Applause]
[44:37] [Music]
[44:40] Elijah and one day brother brandham got
[44:44] bully and he said you know
[44:48] bully you had a queen of a
[44:51] mother hope she was a
[44:54] queen
[44:56] she was just something
[45:03] extraordinary she was not maybe a
[45:07] woman she was a
[45:14] lady
[45:17] and all that she wanted to see
[45:21] is success for a husband
[45:26] brother
[45:29] brandham and I think that's why bully
[45:31] was so over brother
[45:33] brandham you can't say
[45:36] anything negative in Bully's presence
[45:40] about his
[45:44] father he was the
[45:48] best
[45:50] friend to his
[45:54] dad and I I always admired
[45:58] that by him what Dad said is yeah and
[46:02] amen settles
[46:04] [Applause]
[46:11] it and Bully couldn't preach
[46:15] because of the marriage and divorce case
[46:17] he
[46:19] had and I watched him all the
[46:22] years he would never go in and go PR
[46:28] because Dad said
[46:36] so he always said I'm a
[46:40] testimony he always said I'm I'm
[46:42] carrying the biscuits to the
[46:46] Brethren brother brandham baked the
[46:49] biscuits but he said he took the
[46:52] biscuits to give it to the
[46:54] brethren
[46:56] so those are the things that I hold
[47:00] dear about
[47:03] bullying and I had the
[47:07] privilege for being in his company quite
[47:10] a few
[47:13] times I do not think there's a South
[47:15] African guy or
[47:19] Minister that had the Privileges I
[47:24] had
[47:27] and therefore I was so rugged in what I
[47:31] believe that they couldn't change my
[47:34] mind at
[47:36] all I know where I am called
[47:41] [Applause]
[47:52] in and
[47:54] um
[47:57] I will
[47:59] always be grateful to
[48:02] God that I had those
[48:06] privileges with brother
[48:12] bully the first time I met him was in
[48:16] 1977 he took me around
[48:19] Jeff took me to the Ohio River his
[48:23] father baptized the 17th person
[48:27] it took me to Spring
[48:33] Street and
[48:35] um he took me to eat at the restaurant
[48:40] brother Bram used to like to go
[48:42] to he took me to the shop where brother
[48:45] BR used to buy that sweets that strong
[48:49] sweets and he bought me a
[48:54] packet he took me to the grave of
[48:56] brother
[49:01] brandham I wouldn't say what happened
[49:05] there he took me to his mother's um
[49:09] grave sister
[49:12] hope he took me to the tour through the
[49:15] church brandham Tabernacle Church
[49:19] because the evening I testified in the
[49:21] church there that's when that guy walked
[49:24] up and told
[49:26] me for all these
[49:28] years we only felt the same anointing
[49:32] that was upon brother Brandon that was
[49:34] on you that was the
[49:40] time and then you know what he gave he
[49:43] gave
[49:44] me and
[49:47] um then he showed me The Minister's room
[49:51] where brother Brandon first went in
[49:53] before he went into the pulpit
[49:57] and in The Minister's room he told me he
[49:59] said
[50:00] uh uh brother
[50:03] Edgar you see this
[50:06] Photograph I said yes I see the
[50:10] photograph he says to me um that
[50:14] photo brother Coleman gave brother
[50:19] brandham and when I looked at the photo
[50:22] God bless you brother when
[50:26] I looked at the
[50:28] photo I saw it was Elijah
[50:39] leaving and brother Brenham hanged it
[50:41] right
[50:43] in he studied there before going into
[50:46] the
[50:48] pit and then without Ado I told Brother
[50:53] Coleman I saw them
[50:56] photograph that you sent
[50:59] brother uh the
[51:03] prophet and then brother Coleman gave me
[51:05] the testimony of the
[51:08] photo somebody drew it painted
[51:12] it and
[51:14] uh and he told me who gave it to him
[51:18] when he received it and looked at it the
[51:21] inspiration of God fell on him brother
[51:24] Coleman
[51:26] and told the inspiration told Brother
[51:29] Coleman wrap it up and send it to my
[51:34] prophet and brother Coleman took the
[51:36] photo wrapped it up and sent it to
[51:39] brother
[51:41] Brenham and without Ado brother Ram took
[51:44] the photo and hanged it in that room
[51:47] it's still there
[51:50] today and
[51:53] um it wasn't
[51:58] long then Elijah did
[52:11] leave and I remember brother K said
[52:15] when when brother random
[52:20] died he walked into the pulit that
[52:24] morning and preach
[52:26] on the shout of the king is in the
[52:30] camp so don't be
[52:33] dismayed the messenger is
[52:36] gone but the shout of the king is in the
[52:44] [Applause]
[52:54] C
[52:56] so many will see that
[52:58] photo but they wouldn't
[53:00] know the history behind
[53:04] it the next meeting with Billy Paul was

[1:00:52] listen to the ministers
[1:00:55] don't listen to a minister that don't
[1:00:57] have the Holy
[1:00:58] [Applause]
[1:01:07] Ghost and he said dad told
[1:01:10] me that that pleased the
[1:01:14] angel so that I could see that angel
[1:01:18] brother osar he stood right
[1:01:20] here and he went right through the
[1:01:23] window gone
[1:01:25] and you know he described the angel
[1:01:27] exactly dark
[1:01:32] [Applause]
[1:01:37] [Music]
[1:01:39] [Applause]
[1:01:40] [Music]
[1:01:41] [Applause]
[1:01:47] skin and you
[1:01:49] hooked Oklahoma up with
[1:01:53] Joe
[1:01:55] to make sure that I
[1:01:57] understood What's
[1:02:00] Happening Now how could I listen to
[1:02:03] these past yeah want to tell me
[1:02:08] something I don't care about
[1:02:11] that I heard straight from the angel of
[1:02:14] the Lord and straight from Brother
[1:02:17] brandham when you laid hands on my head
[1:02:20] I don't listen to No
[1:02:22] Minister you're not on my level and I
[1:02:24] will never listen to
[1:02:26] [Applause]
[1:02:40] you what a testimony that
[1:02:45] [Applause]
[1:02:50] is if you look deep into this story here
[1:02:54] what he says since the angel left
[1:02:57] him he got
[1:03:00] discernment so I look deep into the
[1:03:02] thing I feel that the angel told him sit
[1:03:07] there and tell him who he
[1:03:09] is how else could it
[1:03:12] be and he sat and he waited for me and
[1:03:15] told me who I
[1:03:18] am if you have the right Spirit you have
[1:03:21] the right word I would rather be right
[1:03:23] in my spirit and wrong in my
[1:03:27] Doctrine and here's Al Tabernacle why
[1:03:30] because the blessing is on
[1:03:33] [Applause]
[1:03:47] somebody now how could guy a
[1:03:49] guy a simple black guy like this African
[1:03:53] boy have a blessing from a
[1:03:56] prophet and a prophet son that saw the
[1:03:59] [Applause]
[1:04:01] angel tell me which which black guy up
[1:04:05] Africa way can have a testimony like
[1:04:08] this
[1:04:11] [Applause]
[1:04:23] n
[1:04:26] okay that's why I can't listen to
[1:04:32] anybody brother Brown says this boy will
[1:04:34] preach exactly what I preach Billy PA
[1:04:37] said this boy has got a nicer Spirit
[1:04:40] among the
[1:04:42] Ministries he'll preach exactly the word
[1:04:47] mechanics buly comes he says you have

[1:16:33] [Applause]
[1:16:45] OS now we're coming to the close
[1:16:49] here a buly Paul
[1:16:52] died
[1:16:56] and as I said there such a lot of things
[1:16:59] going
[1:17:01] on lot of people
[1:17:05] talking a lot of people
[1:17:09] criticizing a lot of people ready to
[1:17:11] leave the message
[1:17:18] again the churches has gone small as I
[1:17:22] told you on sister Sunday Monday was it
[1:17:25] Monday Monday it's going to be worse
[1:17:31] now but elter I want to tell you that
[1:17:34] you have a man of God in a poop
[1:17:37] [Applause]
[1:17:52] Hallelujah
[1:18:00] [Applause]
[1:18:04] [Music]
[1:18:07] [Applause]
[1:18:21] w
[1:18:24] [Applause]
[1:18:33] I ain't going
[1:18:35] [Applause]
[1:18:39] [Music]
[1:18:51] nowhere
[1:18:59] [Applause]
[1:19:07] brother bully
[1:19:09] died remember to be spiritual now I'm
[1:19:12] asking you to be spiritual
[1:19:14] now just a little thing can throw you
[1:19:18] out and offboard amen and make you
[1:19:21] believe some fault
[1:19:23] things just a little
[1:19:26] thing that's overlooked in the
[1:19:30] scripture can throw you way back in the
[1:19:36] world therefore a
[1:19:39] pastor must be very
[1:19:42] sensitive
[1:19:44] to the word of
[1:19:51] God
[1:19:55] now this thing of bully Paul in Los
[1:19:58] Angeles a small thing in that quote can
[1:20:02] make you give up deny the
[1:20:06] message reject the
[1:20:08] message reject brother
[1:20:11] brandham and yet brother brandham says
[1:20:14] sometimes things got to be said so that
[1:20:17] some may flock away
[1:20:21] exactly
[1:20:23] but El Tabernacle you're not going to
[1:20:25] flock away I am standing right there I
[1:20:29] will stop you from fing
[1:20:33] [Applause]
[1:20:50] away just a little thing that you miss
[1:20:53] in the scriptures will make you
[1:20:56] backslide or leave the message so your
[1:20:59] leader must be very
[1:21:02] spiritual because God is pruned to hide
[1:21:06] things he likes to do
[1:21:12] it he likes to do things to make you
[1:21:15] like
[1:21:15] [Music]
[1:21:17] [Applause]
[1:21:21] this
[1:21:24] one time brother Brandon was waiting
[1:21:27] for a vision to get
[1:21:30] fulfilled and he waited and he know
[1:21:33] everything was settled everything was
[1:21:34] said there and uh he was wondering now
[1:21:38] what what is wrong that thing had to
[1:21:41] break and you know what was
[1:21:44] wrong a hat was not on the on the right
[1:21:48] place a hat so a hat
[1:21:57] so perfect is your
[1:22:02] God how can we ever be
[1:22:05] [Applause]
[1:22:13] God little
[1:22:15] thing small thing
[1:22:21] ahead
[1:22:23] everything must be lined up then God
[1:22:29] moves
[1:22:31] why because the Song of
[1:22:33] Solomon Chapter 2:1 15 says it's the
[1:22:36] little
[1:22:38] foxes that spoils the
[1:22:42] vine that little
[1:22:45] intri that make you miss
[1:22:48] [Applause]
[1:22:51] God
[1:22:58] so here is a little thing that causing
[1:23:01] the stumbling block and people wanting
[1:23:03] to leave the
[1:23:05] message and as I said I'm responsible
[1:23:08] for El
[1:23:09] Tabernacle
[1:23:11] only I'm going to give an
[1:23:16] account of
[1:23:19] this what I see amen now
[1:23:23] watch be
[1:23:26] alert with every problem in this
[1:23:30] message 20 some OD years
[1:23:33] ago I found the answer to every
[1:23:41] problem that's why we could never go
[1:23:45] wrong and I'm going to tell you the
[1:23:49] [Applause]
[1:23:51] problem
[1:23:53] you want to know the problem you did
[1:23:56] hear it before
[1:23:57] but in the light that it is now you'll
[1:24:01] know it even the
[1:24:03] better
[1:24:05] amen okay let's
[1:24:07] go to 1963
[1:24:11] 721 he cares do you listen to the
[1:24:14] message he cares do you
[1:24:20] care it was on Luther
[1:24:23] King brother Braham says he's going to
[1:24:25] lead thousands of
[1:24:28] people to their death and it didn't
[1:24:31] happen and this guy wrote to brother
[1:24:33] brandham says did you
[1:24:35] prophesy because Martin Luther King just
[1:24:39] died and this is what brother brandham
[1:24:42] had to
[1:24:42] say have we got it
[1:24:45] brother listen to what he says he says
[1:24:47] now see
[1:24:49] listen listen to this now see I've
[1:24:53] always asked you to be careful little
[1:24:56] things be careful amen what you're
[1:25:00] listening to see that's Point number one
[1:25:04] he is educating the bride now to be
[1:25:10] careful what are you listening
[1:25:15] to have you got that
[1:25:20] point let's go on with that
[1:25:24] quote point two not everything is thus
[1:25:28] sayth the Lord that I say so brother
[1:25:31] brandham when he speak is not everything
[1:25:33] is thus sayth the Lord
[1:25:36] amen oh my when brother BR say throw
[1:25:40] that ball is that that say the
[1:25:42] Lord not everything he said now I didn't
[1:25:46] say it brother brandham said it and if
[1:25:47] brother Brenham said it that you have to
[1:25:49] be careful then you have to check
[1:25:51] whether the thing is thus sayith the
[1:25:56] Lord
[1:25:58] hallelujah Glory
[1:26:05] Hallelujah so before you
[1:26:08] run is it God speaking or is it William
[1:26:11] brenham's Human Side
[1:26:13] speaking brother Brenham goes on I'm
[1:26:16] going to show you further he says
[1:26:17] there's many things in the spoken word
[1:26:19] That's The Human Side not the prophetic
[1:26:22] side
[1:26:23] [Applause]
[1:26:25] so when you read the scripture and the
[1:26:27] quotes you must make sure that it is
[1:26:30] thus sayeth the Lord and not brother
[1:26:32] bram's Human
[1:26:35] Side
[1:26:36] amen am that answers all the
[1:26:40] [Applause]
[1:26:47] [Music]
[1:26:49] questions now listen what he says
[1:26:53] Point number
[1:26:54] three for everything in the message that
[1:26:57] goes forth this is what you have to
[1:27:02] do
[1:27:05] what read it for
[1:27:14] me are they doing
[1:27:17] it brother Bram speak like a human being
[1:27:20] and not thus say the Lord then they want
[1:27:21] to say listen brother Brenham is a human
[1:27:24] being not everything he spoke was thus
[1:27:26] say the
[1:27:27] Lord so he says watch when I say that
[1:27:30] say of the
[1:27:32] [Applause]
[1:27:40] Lord oh my my my my my my my my
[1:27:45] [Applause]
[1:27:51] my
[1:27:52] [Applause]
[1:27:58] he goes further point 4
[1:28:01] five it's not me it's him if it's me it
[1:28:05] will fail but if it's him it can't
[1:28:10] fail if it's William brandham that said
[1:28:12] it and not thus sayth the Lord it will
[1:28:18] fail so now you got two streams to watch
[1:28:21] as you read the spoken word is it thus
[1:28:23] say the Lord or is it brother brandham
[1:28:28] [Applause]
[1:28:34] [Music]
[1:28:38] saying can I have a witness
[1:28:40] [Applause]
[1:28:40] [Music]
[1:28:44] [Applause]
[1:28:51] here
[1:28:54] now let's go to the next
[1:28:57] one listen to what he says and I can't
[1:29:00] say it until he tells me I could be
[1:29:03] altogether wrong in my thought about
[1:29:06] Martin Luther King and he was
[1:29:08] wrong because it was not thus sayeth the
[1:29:15] Lord how you going to rock edar
[1:29:19] Osco I have Bible and word
[1:29:23] Hallelujah I am not an ordinary
[1:29:27] Minister I am
[1:29:29] [Music]
[1:29:30] [Applause]
[1:29:38] special Point number
[1:29:41] six this is me
[1:29:43] speaking it's my opinion so I was wrong
[1:29:48] that was just the human side and not the
[1:29:52] thus sayeth the Lord that's why it
[1:29:55] didn't come to
[1:30:04] pass I want to ask you elter
[1:30:11] vano can you see where I'm going
[1:30:20] to
[1:30:22] [Applause]
[1:30:32] when he speaks it's thus sayth the
[1:30:36] Lord now I have dissected the quote from
[1:30:39] bully
[1:30:40] Paul I was in this meeting will he play
[1:30:44] the
[1:30:50] clip reach back
[1:30:53] a new shock of
[1:30:55] hair said just once
[1:30:58] more I believe that's the hour that
[1:31:00] we're
[1:31:02] living I believe that with all of
[1:31:04] us I believe that God making his final
[1:31:10] move going
[1:31:19] home if you want a little s to look at
[1:31:23] you need a little
[1:31:25] sign look at this old man he said I
[1:31:29] won't be an
[1:31:30] old sharks will be swimming where you're
[1:31:35] standing get
[1:31:46] close you
[1:31:50] seated now I want you to be honest with
[1:31:53] edar
[1:31:54] Rosco did he say th say of the
[1:32:00] Lord it says thus say the Lord bully you
[1:32:04] will not be an old
[1:32:05] man so
[1:32:11] n it is not th sayth the
[1:32:15] Lord it is brother bram's opinion in a
[1:32:19] private interview
[1:32:22] with his
[1:32:24] son it is not in the spoken word
[1:32:28] nowhere because the spoken word is for
[1:32:30] the bride so that was not for
[1:32:33] us that was for Billy Paul Point number
[1:32:37] [Applause]
[1:32:46] two point number
[1:32:50] three
[1:32:52] he spoke many of things to Brothers
[1:32:55] personally he told Brother R you'll be a
[1:32:59] preacher that's not in a spoken
[1:33:02] word and Ashley Campbell told Brother
[1:33:04] brand brother buly I was there he did
[1:33:07] tell you that but he never say you're
[1:33:09] fful Minister and bang Dev R
[1:33:14] gos he told bcll some things about a
[1:33:17] woman that Bisal told
[1:33:18] me personal you won't find it in the
[1:33:21] spook
[1:33:22] word he told home how many
[1:33:25] things about Bishop Johnson and what
[1:33:28] have you personal it's not in the spoken
[1:33:31] word so it's got nothing to do with a
[1:33:35] [Applause]
[1:33:39] bride so that is in two parts
[1:33:43] there it's in two parts the one part was
[1:33:46] human speaking to Billy Paul and not
[1:33:50] thus say the Lord the other part of the
[1:33:52] Sharks will swim is thus sayth the
[1:33:55] Lord that's going to
[1:34:01] [Applause]
[1:34:13] happen now why is it thus say the Lord
[1:34:17] is because of Los Angeles choosing of a
[1:34:20] bride
[1:34:22] am when brother brandham came to the pit
[1:34:26] Ed Hunter told me he said brother Rosco
[1:34:28] it was bad you know when brother Brown
[1:34:31] spoke about that cow how she looks and
[1:34:34] that's how some woman
[1:34:37] looks he said don't marry a woman like
[1:34:40] that that's got that cow
[1:34:44] look he says and the Pentecost was
[1:34:46] laughing and joking he says all of a
[1:34:49] sudden the atmosphere switched
[1:34:52] and it was like angel's wings coming
[1:34:55] into the
[1:34:56] church and then brother brandham got up
[1:34:58] he said thus sayeth the Lord Los Angeles
[1:35:02] Los
[1:35:03] Angeles one day you'll find yourself
[1:35:06] beneath the ocean that's thus sayth the
[1:35:09] Lord the Shark part is thus sayith the
[1:35:12] Lord but the Bully part is not thus
[1:35:16] sayith the Lord it is also not on the
[1:35:19] tapes it is also not in the
[1:35:22] [Applause]
[1:35:25] books are you clear on it so why was we
[1:35:29] worry we worry about that say of the
[1:35:33] [Applause]
[1:35:40] Lord and you know how this
[1:35:44] happened brother BR and
[1:35:47] prophesied and said thus say the
[1:35:50] Lord sister
[1:35:52] shakarian demon sharan's sister you
[1:35:56] shall
[1:35:58] die and in the same meeting a guy got up
[1:36:01] and spoke in
[1:36:03] tongues well Paul said he had Go's
[1:36:09] flesh and he was
[1:36:11] worried and the interpretation
[1:36:14] was my daughter you won't
[1:36:17] die you will
[1:36:20] love
[1:36:22] and Bully was
[1:36:25] worried brother Benham looked at
[1:36:28] him and said buly what's
[1:36:33] wrong said no nothing there he said no
[1:36:36] no no you you worried about the
[1:36:39] tongues he says yes yes Dad that was
[1:36:43] really nail biting Goose flesh
[1:36:48] stuff you could feel it brother said to
[1:36:52] him buly all did I say the same angel
[1:36:55] that told me sharks will
[1:36:58] swarm told me she's going to
[1:37:01] die then he added his own opinion he
[1:37:05] says you might not even get an old
[1:37:08] man so that was not thus sayith the Lord
[1:37:11] the Sharks was thus sayith the
[1:37:14] Lord and then two weeks after that Deus
[1:37:18] zakarian's sister died so if she died
[1:37:23] Los Angel because it's the same angel
[1:37:25] that says she's going to die said Los
[1:37:27] Angeles is going to sink it's going to
[1:37:30] [Applause]
[1:37:30] [Music]
[1:37:33] [Applause]
[1:37:37] sink now can you see what God does to
[1:37:40] throw people off he makes brother
[1:37:43] Brenham say give his opinion and not
[1:37:45] thus sayth the Lord but we have a quote
[1:37:47] where brother Bram says you better
[1:37:49] listen to thus sayeth the Lord
[1:37:54] am I don't like this amen yet there's a
[1:37:58] little doubt in this
[1:37:59] [Applause]
[1:38:17] same
[1:38:20] no the cracking thing
[1:38:23] is when did Bully
[1:38:31] die what is
[1:38:36] October is
[1:38:39] October the 70th
[1:38:44] Jubilee we're going into the last part
[1:38:46] of the 70th Jubilee what's the 70th of
[1:38:50] 70th Jubilee
[1:38:52] it's Los Angeles going
[1:38:54] down because there must be an earthquake
[1:38:57] to open the
[1:39:01] graves and brother Bram takes Bly Paul
[1:39:05] and hook it up with a 70th
[1:39:08] Jubilee and he died in the time of the
[1:39:12] 70th
[1:39:15] [Applause]

[1:40:41] tree don't you want to go with
[1:40:44] me God is telling you it's time for Los
[1:40:47] Angeles to go down that's why I
[1:40:49] connected Billy's name with Los Angeles
[1:40:52] IST and how do you know the scientist
[1:40:56] says in 5 minutes or in 5 years those
[1:40:59] angels must be below the
