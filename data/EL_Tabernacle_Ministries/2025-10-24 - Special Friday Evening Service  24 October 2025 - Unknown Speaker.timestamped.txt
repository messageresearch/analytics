[25:40] Now, we going to the more reverent part.

[26:56] And I would like to [music] thank God
[26:58] for being so good to me and my family
[27:01] always handing always handing us under
[27:06] hiding us under his wings [music] from
[27:08] sister. There's an unwritten prayer
[27:11] request. Can the reverently lift our
[27:12] hands believing the Lord will make a way
[27:15] for us tonight as we approach the throne
[27:18] of grace.
[27:20] Great and eternal heavenly father,
[27:24] the most high God, the one who was, the
[27:28] one who is, and the one who [music] is
[27:29] to come.
[27:31] &gt;&gt; Father God, we say thank you tonight,
[27:33] Lord God, that we can live in the days
[27:35] of Dian Apostle at the U Ros.
[27:39] Father God, surely but surely, he is
[27:42] that thunder that shakes the skies. He
[27:45] is the voice of God that makes the skies
[27:48] to tremble. He is the five-fold
[27:52] ministry, Lord God. Heavenly Father, as
[27:54] we can recall, Lord God, he was a elder
[27:57] died five times, Lord God, and the
[28:00] ministry gave him a new heart, Lord God.
[28:03] He was a young man, Lord God, blind, and
[28:05] the ministry prayed for him and eyeballs
[28:08] fall back into his sockets, Lord God.
[28:11] Somewhere in Brazil, a woman lost the
[28:13] arm in an accident, Lord God. And while
[28:16] the ministry preached, the arm grew
[28:18] back, Lord. So, Father God, here's the
[28:20] prayer request tonight. Lord God,
[28:23] [screaming] we pray before the throne of
[28:25] God. Lord God, you told the prophet if
[28:27] you can get this people to believe you,
[28:29] Lord Canel will stand before you. The
[28:32] greater than William Prenam is here
[28:34] tonight, Lord God. [screaming] We
[28:35] believe the man tonight, Lord God. So,
[28:38] none of this in this prayer request can
[28:40] stand before him. Lord God, may you heal
[28:42] the sick and the afflicted, Lord. May
[28:44] you answer the hands that is lifted.
[28:47] Heavenly Father, the unwritten prayer
[28:48] requests, Lord God, we thank you for the
[28:51] thankful hearts, Lord God. It shows us
[28:53] that God is move moving in our midst. We
[28:56] thank you, Lord God. Come and bless us
[28:57] tonight. Come and undertake for us in
[28:59] the wonderful name of Jehovah at Rosco.
[29:03] Amen.
[29:09] Amen. Can we just give the Lord another
[29:11] beautiful hand of praise?
[29:14] Amen.
[29:16] I just wonder as the ashes could go
[29:18] around to collect the tithes and the
[29:20] offerings.
[29:28] Isn't it wonderful being in the house of
[29:30] the Lord?
[29:32] &gt;&gt; I can't hear you, church. Isn't it
[29:33] wonderful being in the house of the

[58:51] It reads,
[58:53] "And he took the mantle
[58:56] &gt;&gt; of Elijah
[58:59] &gt;&gt; that fell from him."
[59:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[59:05] &gt;&gt; And he smoked the waters.
[59:08] And he said,
[59:11] &gt;&gt; And he said,

[59:53] &gt;&gt; Let's get into it. Amen.
[59:56] &gt;&gt; My title tonight,
[1:00:00] &gt;&gt; you should know it already.
[1:00:02] Where
[1:00:04] &gt;&gt; is the God of Elijah?
[1:00:07] &gt;&gt; Where is the God of Elijah?
[1:00:11] &gt;&gt; And for an inspiration,
[1:00:14] handlers of the oil,
[1:00:16] &gt;&gt; I took my title and inspiration
[1:00:19] when God's apostle preached
[1:00:22] the handlers of the oil.
[1:00:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:33] Elijah
[1:00:35] &gt;&gt; in the Bible
[1:00:37] &gt;&gt; and in the scriptures
[1:00:39] &gt;&gt; is a very notable,
[1:00:42] &gt;&gt; a very important
[1:00:45] prophet.
[1:00:47] &gt;&gt; Very little is known about this
[1:00:50] prophet's background.
[1:00:52] &gt;&gt; It almost seems as if he comes out of
[1:00:54] nowhere.
[1:00:56] When you read the scriptures about him,
[1:00:58] there's no background of his father.
[1:01:02] Normally, when you read a scripture, it
[1:01:03] will say so and so,
[1:01:06] &gt;&gt; the father of so and so.
[1:01:09] &gt;&gt; But that's not the case with Elijah.
[1:01:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:14] The prophet explains
