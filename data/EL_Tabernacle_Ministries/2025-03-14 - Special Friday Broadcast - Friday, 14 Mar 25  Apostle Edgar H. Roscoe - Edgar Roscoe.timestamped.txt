[3:43] Daniel
[3:45] Amen if you have your Bibles with you
[3:47] let's turn to the book of
[3:48] Hebrews the book of Hebrews that St Paul
[3:52] wrote because he was a Hebrew of
[3:56] Hebrews touching the Lord he was a
[4:00] Pharisee of
[4:03] Pharisees touching
[4:05] the the dispensation of
[4:09] Grace he was the first and foremost
[4:12] messenger of
[4:14] God touching the writings of the New
[4:18] Testament he wrote them all and
[4:22] everybody had to pattern after
[4:24] him because he says if an angel come
[4:26] from heaven and say anything contrary to
[4:29] what I I say let him be a
[4:32] [Music]
[4:33] curse Hebrews the book of Hebrews the
[4:38] 12th
[4:39] chapter reading the 16th and the 17th
[4:45] verse 16th and 17th
[4:51] verse L there be any fornicators a
[4:54] profane person as
[4:58] Esau who for one morcel of meat sold his
[5:02] birth
[5:04] right for you know how that
[5:07] afterwards after he sold
[5:10] out when he would have inherit the
[5:13] blessing he was supposed to inherit the
[5:17] blessing he was supposed to have
[5:19] been in the kingdom of
[5:23] God he was supposed to make it for
[5:27] heaven but he sold out
[5:31] gave it
[5:32] away didn't want
[5:35] it rejected it played around with
[5:39] it made a fool of
[5:43] it listen to what the word of God
[5:46] says inherited the
[5:49] blessing he was
[5:53] rejected even if he was
[5:59] supposed to have the
[6:03] blessing even if it was he was the son
[6:07] of a
[6:10] prophet even if he was in the
[6:13] lineage of many righteous
[6:17] man even if he
[6:20] was very
[6:25] religious he was rejected
[6:31] he was
[6:33] rejected for he found no place of
[6:41] repentance there was no place
[6:46] found for
[6:53] repentance it's all
[6:57] right no place found for repentance
[7:01] listen to the next
[7:04] line though he sought it
[7:07] carefully with
[7:10] tears
[7:13] carefully took his
[7:16] time went through his
[7:18] life line by
[7:22] line do by
[7:25] dot comma by comma as he took
[7:30] stock of his
[7:35] life and not only checking
[7:38] it but checking it with tears in his
[7:45] eyes maybe many a prayer went up at that
[7:49] moment of his
[7:52] distress and
[7:54] Gloom and being away from God and felt
[7:58] no touch from God
[8:01] anymore rejected
[8:04] it then what
[8:07] happened he
[8:10] cried he checked himself
[8:13] out he was still
[8:16] religious he still believed that his
[8:18] father was a
[8:20] prophet so believing brother Brenham is
[8:23] a prophet and it's your father if you do
[8:25] not live the life you go gone
[8:30] you gone God has no grandchildren the
[8:32] prophet
[8:35] says being in this message and think you
[8:37] are right and live any type of a
[8:40] life don't think that you are
[8:50] right seeking a place of
[8:53] repentance although we sought it
[8:56] carefully with
[8:58] tears cannot play with
[9:03] God God wants you to keep
[9:08] sincerity and fight
[9:11] on my son Jude preached not so long
[9:14] ago Don't
[9:17] Stop Don't
[9:23] Stop seeking it with
[9:27] tears many preachers think that when a
[9:29] man
[9:31] cries God will give him an opportunity
[9:34] to come back he didn't do it with
[9:42] Esau you
[9:44] cry while the grace of God is upon you
[9:48] then God wipes it
[9:51] away but when you cross the
[9:55] line you can cry until the cows come
[9:58] home
[10:03] you would don't listen to
[10:08] you let us bow our
[10:10] heads father what is
[10:15] scripture many and many Ministers of
[10:17] today
[10:19] Lord they'll be shaken when they see
[10:22] somebody cry at the altar like
[10:25] Esau but oh God
[10:31] once they cross that
[10:34] line nothing nothing
[10:38] nothing nothing will help them entering
[10:40] into the
[10:42] joys of the
[10:44] Lord I do pray that this morning

[15:25] On I've heard the other day that uh
[15:28] somebody said
[15:29] I preached on down the horizontal
[15:31] rainbow
[15:33] and uh that Mr
[15:37] Rosco uh doesn't care what he
[15:41] says when he's behind the poopit and
[15:43] speak about sex and stuff like that no I
[15:46] don't
[15:47] care and I don't apologize
[15:52] [Applause]
[15:56] [Music]
[16:00] if your pastor has a
[16:02] wishbone and cannot say those things
[16:04] then let him have a
[16:06] wishbone but I want to tell you I have a
[16:08] backbone and I'll say it again and again
[16:11] and
[16:13] [Applause]
[16:18] again I'd like to say that uh the young
[16:22] people years these things in
[16:25] school and you still want to speak about
[16:27] stalks bringing babies and stuff like
[16:31] that they know the hard facts and that's
[16:33] the reason I preach the hard
[16:36] facts I put it down without rubber
[16:41] gloves brother Brenham had to put it
[16:44] down and speak and it was bad in those
[16:46] times for saying those things that
[16:48] brother Brenham said when he spoke about
[16:51] the hum's underneath
[16:54] clothing is showing and it's a
[16:56] disgrace it was hard for him to say
[16:59] because nobody ever said it but we're
[17:01] living in another age that's worse than
[17:03] brother Bron's age this is
[17:10] worse and now I don't say that the
[17:13] humans underneath clothing is showing I
[17:14] said the penties are showing it's
[17:17] exactly what brother brandham says just
[17:19] brother BR couldn't say the way I say
[17:22] it because this is the age that
[17:25] needs the thing to be said
[17:29] [Applause]
[17:30] amen and if you not call Pastor to say
[17:33] it then don't say it you'll cause a lot
[17:35] of
[17:36] stumbling when you say it but when I say
[17:39] it it cause
[17:42] repentance wherever I preach that
[17:45] message fth came
[17:48] up and people
[17:50] [Applause]
[17:54] [Music]
[17:55] repented I preached that message down in
[17:59] Zimbabwe
[18:00] buo brother Beck walk up to me he says
[18:03] nobody can ever preach that the way you
[18:06] do cuz you have a gift to do it now if
[18:10] you don't have the gift to do it then
[18:11] shut up I'll do it for
[18:22] you years ago brother Coleman preached
[18:25] and in between his preaching he says
[18:27] there that woman sits with the split
[18:29] legs
[18:31] open and most of the ministers came down
[18:33] on him and I met him afterwards he says
[18:36] I do not know what's wrong with the
[18:38] ministers said God says he says uh do
[18:41] they read brother brandom and those guys
[18:43] didn't even know that was a
[18:48] quote can you imagine brother
[18:51] brandham how many years is ago brother
[18:54] Renee 30 some years that brother Rena
[18:57] spoke about a man stucking his fath in
[19:00] the woman and the woman is a a sexual
[19:02] garbage
[19:04] can 30 somewhat years ago and you want
[19:06] to play around Mister amen if you can't
[19:09] preach it get out of the poopet get
[19:10] somebody that will say it and preach
[19:17] it you know they they tried all the
[19:20] years to have something against me but
[19:22] every time they have something it
[19:24] actually boosts me
[19:26] [Music]
[19:29] [Applause]
[19:35] today I'm going to preach something that
[19:37] I think that ministers wouldn't like
[19:39] ministers would U would say how could he
[19:42] do a thing like
[19:44] this how could he show things like this
[19:47] in his
[19:49] church but again I would like to tell
[19:51] you that when I feel inspired of God
[19:53] then I do what God tells me
[20:01] and I'm going to go into things today
[20:03] that is
[20:05] mindboggling and I'm here to try and
[20:07] help my young people as I was told not
[20:09] long ago in the week and before that
[20:13] that somebody said you know there's a
[20:14] lot of virgins in Edgar Rosco's
[20:17] church so you don't have to tell me I
[20:20] know that because that's what I preach I
[20:23] tried to keep them
[20:25] clean and now even the world says he has
[20:28] a of Virgin sitting
[20:30] here so my young sister you think that
[20:33] nobody's watching you and you think that
[20:35] maybe you do not have a boyriend now
[20:37] they they they there's no eyes on you
[20:39] the eyes of the world is on you and they
[20:41] know who you
[20:43] are so keep yourself
[20:50] clean keep yourself
[20:53] clean don't let Devil's coming in and
[20:55] and and and wants to disrupt you and and
[20:57] the devil tells nobody's looking at you
[20:59] and that's why you don't have a
[21:00] boyfriend your boyfriend is on the way
[21:02] and when he's on the way he's going to
[21:04] appreciate you so much that
[21:08] you so you would like to be just around
[21:11] [Applause]
[21:19] you and it's
[21:22] funny uh that somebody phoned me I would
[21:24] not call her name phoned me and told me
[21:27] this but son Saturday after I
[21:30] preach I told my wife you know while I
[21:32] was preaching I looked around the
[21:34] congregation I saw so many virgins I
[21:37] said
[21:38] lovey I feel like fighting
[21:41] [Applause]
[21:52] on and may Lucifer know it may the
[21:56] hounds of Hell know it as long as I'm
[21:59] behind this Pulpit I'll preach Holiness
[22:03] like no man in the pipo ministry will
[22:07] preach
[22:09] it I will preach it with gloves of my
[22:12] hands rugged as rugged can be
[22:18] [Applause]
[22:28] and don't let anybody else tell you
[22:30] anything I am sent to help
[22:35] you I am sent to help
[22:38] [Applause]
[22:48] you and what I'm going to
[22:52] preach might not look so good to other
[22:55] people but it's good to me
[22:58] and they will say well how could brother
[23:00] Ros could do a thing like that but I
[23:03] would like to tell you that um brother
[23:06] Brenham one time was on the hunting trip
[23:08] and he
[23:08] walked and the angel of the Lord told
[23:11] him pick up that cigarette
[23:13] box and he said Lord I I never touch
[23:17] those things he says pick it up that's
[23:20] your message for
[23:24] Sunday a cigarette box and I want to
[23:28] tell you my brother and my pastor friend
[23:30] and
[23:31] preachers I'm picking up my cigarette
[23:33] box this morning and bringing out my
[23:37] message this
[23:45] morning Peter was told when he saw a
[23:48] vision of all the creeping things that
[23:51] the Jews was not supposed to eat and the
[23:54] voice told him eat kill and eat and he
[23:57] says I'm never
[23:59] at Haram
[24:03] before the angel told him listen you
[24:05] what I may don't call it
[24:08] haram slay and
[24:10] [Applause]
[24:17] eat so what I'm going to be busy with
[24:20] you do not call it by Any Other
[24:22] [Applause]
[24:27] Name just say that God showed him
[24:29] something that I never saw be honest
[24:32] once in your
[24:35] [Applause]
[24:37] life I must fulfill my
[24:40] purpose and I must come to make sense to
[24:43] the spoken word of William
[24:45] Brenan as he has
[24:47] [Applause]
[24:51] said in the spoken word that men will
[24:54] follow me in birth pains to make sense
[24:57] to the word
[24:59] and I must fulfill my
[25:01] purpose and so far I'm
[25:03] pleased I can see that I'm fulfilling my
[25:07] purpose what's in my heart I can see
[25:10] it's being
[25:12] fulfilled
[25:15] so I'd like to entitle this
[25:20] message crossing the
[25:24] line
[25:27] crossing the the
[25:31] line don't ever
[25:34] cross the
[25:37] line you'll feel
[25:40] religious you'll still feel that you're
[25:43] in the
[25:44] message you'll still go to
[25:47] church you'll still
[25:50] pray you'll
[25:52] weep you'll feel an anointing but it'll
[25:55] be on the outer cord
[25:59] but you have crossed the
[26:01] line God don't even listen to
[26:04] you
[26:07] crossing the
[26:11] line crossing the line means the place
[26:14] where something like a road a roadway or
[26:19] a Waterway or a line maybe
[26:23] crossed that's what crossing the line
[26:26] means lines get C gets drawn to
[26:30] determine
[26:32] borders that line is is is being drawn
[26:36] to show you this side is that country
[26:38] this side is this
[26:40] country anything that goes over that
[26:43] line is in
[26:46] trouble you are an alien when you come
[26:49] from this side and cross the line on the
[26:51] other side without papers you're an
[26:53] alien in that country
[26:59] God I mean the the the the governments
[27:02] of that country has all the
[27:05] right to put you into
[27:10] ceration and if they feel like throwing
[27:12] the key away they can because you cross
[27:15] the
[27:18] line crossing the line means that you're
[27:20] in somebody else's
[27:24] territory and you broke laws
[27:29] young people don't cross the
[27:33] line don't think that you can go on and
[27:37] on and on and God will just sit there
[27:40] and smile and say nothing and God will
[27:43] Pat you on your shoulder because he
[27:45] wants you to be saved God don't need
[27:48] you you need him
[28:02] could we have that first
[28:06] slide crossing the
[28:09] line
[28:11] normally you have a sign a skeleton or a
[28:15] skeleton's
[28:17] head and they
[28:19] said don't come into this
[28:22] terate and there's a skeleton's head
[28:25] there it means if you cross the line and
[28:29] there's a skeleton's head
[28:32] there
[28:34] then it means that you are going to
[28:38] become like a
[28:39] skeleton you are going to be severed
[28:45] apart you are going to be like the
[28:48] skeleton's head that's what a notice
[28:50] actually
[28:53] means and crossing the line
[28:58] could mean that your mortal life comes
[29:00] to an
[29:02] end crossing the
[29:05] line will make you a skeleton's
[29:10] head normally when they have a sign on
[29:13] the on the gate beware the dogs they
[29:16] have the same head
[29:19] there with a cross on
[29:23] there don't enter into this territory
[29:28] because he has vicious dogs here dogs
[29:32] that will ravage you dogs that will make
[29:36] you look like a
[29:38] skeleton dogs that's put there for one
[29:41] purpose is to protect the territory and
[29:45] everybody that passes the line that dog
[29:49] has the right to sever and tear him
[29:53] apart that's
[29:55] true crossing the line
[30:03] the logistics of that sign is don't
[30:06] cross that line into this
[30:09] territory you'll be SED apart I have

[1:02:09] that could lead him into it but he
[1:02:11] wanted to listen to other
[1:02:17] men that William brandham was the hand
[1:02:21] of God to draw him away from the line of

[1:02:56] it and here you sit in the church where
[1:02:58] the holy spirit is and where you can be
[1:03:00] saved where you'll never cross the line
[1:03:03] why don't you listen to this
[1:03:05] [Applause]
[1:03:13] preacher how will I get how will I know
[1:03:16] if I get the Holy Spirit or I have the
[1:03:18] Holy Spirit of God in Me and uh so I I
[1:03:23] don't quite know that uh this Baptist
[1:03:26] preacher don't even know how to get it
[1:03:28] too and some ministers in this message
[1:03:32] want to be Baptist they even turn around
[1:03:34] and says I would rather be a Baptist
[1:03:36] than a Pentecostal you don't even know
[1:03:38] what you're talking about sir you are
[1:03:40] actually saying that you want to be
[1:03:42] caring the only Eagles that there is is
[1:03:45] Eagles that's got the holy ghost that
[1:03:46] knows where to fly don't you know that
[1:03:55] I don't want to be a Baptist Hallelujah
[1:03:59] but I want to have the Pentecostal
[1:04:01] experience
[1:04:12] amen how would I know if I get the Holy
[1:04:14] Spirit or I have the Holy Spirit of God
[1:04:16] in Me and uh so was I I don't quite know
[1:04:21] that uh I said God has promised us
[1:04:24] everything
[1:04:25] and as long as we're faithful to him
[1:04:27] he'll give us everything we're supposed
[1:04:29] to have and when we get it we'll know it
[1:04:31] when we we have what we're supposed to
[1:04:32] have we'll know it I said I think that's
[1:04:35] Infinity you're talking about Infinity
[1:04:37] he said
[1:04:38] Infinity you're talking if you talk
[1:04:40] about the Holy Ghost you're talking
[1:04:41] about
[1:04:43] Infinity Elvis knew more than a lot of
[1:04:46] bunch of ministers in this message that
[1:04:49] has rejected the Holy Ghost because of
[1:04:51] jumping and shouting if you don't jump
[1:04:53] and Shout you don't have it sir and I
[1:04:55] pull no
[1:04:56] punches that's one of the aspects of the
[1:04:59] Holy
[1:05:08] Ghost we have what we're supposed to
[1:05:10] have we'll know it I said I think that's
[1:05:12] Infinity you're talking about Infinity
[1:05:14] he said well I just want is
[1:05:17] God when you have the Holy Ghost you
[1:05:19] have God God in
[1:05:22] you Hallelujah the word and the spirit
[1:05:25] is God himself not the word the spirit
[1:05:28] and the
[1:05:30] word Let It Roll brother so I think
[1:05:33] that's Infinity you're talking about
[1:05:35] Infinity he said well I just want my
[1:05:37] what my mama had my mama had something
[1:05:38] real good so I kind of thought that was
[1:05:41] up my mama had something real
[1:05:45] good we you hear what brother brandham
[1:05:48] says about his
[1:05:50] mom all ministers in this
[1:05:54] message are you going to cross the
[1:05:57] line for you can never return to the
[1:06:00] Holy Ghost
[1:06:04] again oh I don't want the Holy Ghost
[1:06:06] that's Edgar Rosco's thing that is
[1:06:08] nothing to do with Edgar Rosco that's
[1:06:10] Infinity that's God hallelujah and it's
[1:06:13] for
[1:06:20] everybody I just want my my mama had my
[1:06:22] mama had something real good so I I
[1:06:25] thought that was a a a simple maybe a
[1:06:30] simple statement from him but a very
[1:06:32] deep one because he he was trying to get
[1:06:35] into this thing of he wanted
[1:06:38] everything it was a deep
[1:06:41] one not the word everybody knows the
[1:06:45] Bible but the Holy Ghost is a deep thing
[1:06:49] amen that even the type of Judas es
[1:06:54] scariot Elvis
[1:06:57] Presley knew that the Holy Ghost is a
[1:06:59] deep thing amen I've dug
[1:07:03] deep and I've drank strange
[1:07:11] Waters uh a simple maybe a simple
[1:07:15] statement from him but a very deep one
[1:07:18] because he he was trying to get into
[1:07:20] this thing of he wanted everything he
[1:07:21] could from God he really loved God he
[1:07:23] would discuss spiritual ideas with us
[1:07:26] and it wasn't so much uh what we did it
[1:07:29] was what happened in the room the at the
[1:07:32] atmosphere how it changed
[1:07:35] from one setting to this
[1:07:39] unbelievable setting with Coach chills
[1:07:41] with on your arm you know and and I I
[1:07:43] kind
[1:07:44] of they would sing with Elvis Presley at
[1:07:47] the backstage after he sang rock and
[1:07:50] roll and these guys would go you'll see
[1:07:52] them later on and you're going to have
[1:07:55] the have a question mark to listen to
[1:07:56] the
[1:07:58] music and uh while they were singing
[1:08:01] with Elvis at the back of the stage they
[1:08:04] could feel the Holy Ghost on their flesh
[1:08:06] as goose pimples comes I don't deny that
[1:08:11] but it's not on the right
[1:08:13] place it's on the
[1:08:19] flesh to this
[1:08:22] unbelievable setting with Co chills on
[1:08:25] your arm you know and and I I use the
[1:08:29] soul
[1:08:31] that in in my analogy of the Hol the
[1:08:34] Holy Spirit sort of came in there and it
[1:08:36] sort of dwelt Among Us and and we really
[1:08:39] begin to
[1:08:40] uh watch what he says the Holy Ghost
[1:08:43] dwelt amongst
[1:08:44] them the Holy Ghost don't give up until
[1:08:47] you cross the
[1:08:49] line says he dwelt amidst us but he
[1:08:53] didn't dwell in US
[1:08:59] young people I hope to shake you this
[1:09:02] morning I hope
[1:09:05] so and remember ministers this is for my
[1:09:08] church for my young
[1:09:13] people and this is the way God wants me
[1:09:15] to show them it's not worth it when the
[1:09:18] very stars that they fall follow is
[1:09:22] fallen stars
[1:09:25] and these fallen stars one's
[1:09:31] God go on brother you know and and I I
[1:09:35] kind of use that in in my analogy of the
[1:09:38] ho the Holy Spirit sort of came in there
[1:09:40] and it's sort of dwelt Among Us and and
[1:09:43] we really begin to uh live the words
[1:09:47] instead of singing the words it kind of
[1:09:49] came in there and saturated us made us
[1:09:51] all equal I think that's that's the
[1:09:52] thing that equals us all out because
[1:09:54] when El started singing you knew he
[1:09:57] meant what he what he was singing you
[1:09:59] know he he meant those words almost
[1:10:01] every time
[1:10:03] Elvis would sing How Great Thou Art he
[1:10:07] had a
[1:10:10] special
[1:10:12] feeling I mean sometimes you can pretend
[1:10:16] that you have an emotion in a song
[1:10:17] almost every time you sang that song you
[1:10:20] could feel the spirit of him because
[1:10:24] that was his actual praying prise to God
[1:10:26] he really believed every word in that
[1:10:28] song he knew how great God is I believe
[1:10:32] that he got more joy out of singing that
[1:10:34] song and I think you can tell when you
[1:10:36] see the video and when you hear it this
[1:10:40] this is this is the soul of Elvis when
[1:10:42] he sings that song oh
[1:10:45] Lord my God listen to that gift without
[1:10:50] [Music]
[1:10:52] repentance Wonder
[1:10:55] consider
[1:10:58] all the
[1:11:00] words I
[1:11:02] has have
[1:11:04] [Music]

[1:13:01] [Music]
[1:13:01] [Applause]
[1:13:04] [Music]
[1:13:08] oh you ever heard a gift like
[1:13:13] that you see the anointing behind
[1:13:17] it but that anointing is not calling
[1:13:20] anybody to Heaven it's calling everybody
[1:13:22] to
[1:13:23] Hell the devil sends his messenger with
[1:13:27] an
[1:13:30] anointing the people gets out of their
[1:13:32] mind when they hear him sing because
[1:13:34] gifts and callings is without
[1:13:38] [Music]
[1:13:39] [Applause]
[1:13:44] repentance and oh my God who was singing
[1:13:47] the
[1:13:48] background bul
[1:13:52] Gators group
[1:14:01] he just sang rock and roll now he just
[1:14:04] sang the the the the PS of hell now and
[1:14:08] people and woman would take out their
[1:14:10] penties and throw it uh amen and men
[1:14:13] will run naked around and people will
[1:14:15] faint uh amen because of the gift that
[1:14:19] that the devil gave him and the
[1:14:21] anointing the devil gave him and then he
[1:14:23] comes at the end of the
[1:14:25] coner How Great Thou Art then it feels
[1:14:29] for God he done the devil's Duty now he
[1:14:33] still wants an opportunity with God you
[1:14:36] cannot have God and have the devil at
[1:14:38] the same time out of one Fountain runs
[1:14:41] no two waters it's only one water and
[1:14:44] it's a clean
[1:14:47] water yes yes yes
[1:14:55] you say you say my but brother Rosco he
[1:14:59] sing gospel me brother I don't care if
[1:15:01] he sings gospel me he's still a devil
[1:15:03] why because Judas was also in the church
[1:15:07] and the Bible says they sang hymns and
[1:15:09] he also sang the
[1:15:13] hymns now you people that think the
[1:15:15] devil is Antichrist now you have learned
[1:15:17] something that the devil is
[1:15:20] religious Mah doesn't mean that he's
[1:15:23] right with God if he hasn't got uh if he
[1:15:26] hasn't got uh the qualities uh amen of a
[1:15:30] minister of God uh then you run away
[1:15:33] from him you better get away from

[1:19:04] that group growing up in a Pentecostal
[1:19:07] church he had seen God work powerfully
[1:19:10] and he threw himself into his faith as
[1:19:12] passionately as his music we according

[1:20:10] sense
[1:20:15] to okay we according to Elvis inspired
[1:20:19] him to sing and inspired him to sing the
[1:20:22] way he sings that he got his uh he got
[1:20:26] his expressions and his uh way of
[1:20:28] singing from the Statesman quartet and
[1:20:31] the Blackwood Brothers those were the
[1:20:33] two dominant groups during that era when

[1:23:40] [Applause]
[1:23:47] this Elvis Love B
[1:23:50] singing there was a sing down at the Lis
[1:23:53] Auditorium
[1:23:54] which was two blocks from where he lived
[1:23:57] in the housing project he was always at
[1:23:59] the Saints and then one month he missed
[1:24:02] and the next month he came back I said
[1:24:04] Son where were you last month why didn't
[1:24:05] you come he said I didn't have enough
[1:24:07] money to buy a ticket I said well you

[1:24:11] come to the stage door I let you in for
[1:24:14] nothing and that's the way it remained
[1:24:17] until about the next thing I knew he was
[1:24:19] letting me in his stage door cuz I
[1:24:21] didn't have the money
[1:24:24] though he sang of his faith with
[1:24:26] conviction Elvis was troubled by
[1:24:28] questions that seemed to
[1:24:31] have he had questions and now you know
[1:24:35] what these questions was how can I be
[1:24:40] saved and it says it was never
[1:24:45] answered he died with a question I
[1:24:48] wonder if I've got the Holy Ghost I
[1:24:50] wonder if I'm right with God he had
[1:24:53] tears in his eyes
[1:24:55] young people tears looking for God
[1:24:58] looking for the way back and I'm so glad
[1:25:01] in this 20th century how mean in this
[1:25:04] Century that we're living in that there
[1:25:07] is a way to God uh there is a Divine
[1:25:11] approach amen and I'm not ashamed to say
[1:25:14] itth the spoken word amen the Holy Ghost
[1:25:18] and the spoken word with preaching under
[1:25:21] the anointing takes you back to God
[1:25:23] again
[1:25:24] [Applause]
[1:25:30] life
[1:25:32] loved though he sang of his faith with
[1:25:35] conviction Elvis was troubled by
[1:25:37] questions that seemed to have no answers
[1:25:41] when the storm exactly at that
[1:25:44] time when he couldn't have an
[1:25:47] answer the answer was walking around in
[1:25:50] Jeffersonville on two feet
[1:25:56] but that's not what he
[1:25:58] wanted he wanted an answer that he could
[1:26:02] still be the rock King but this answer
[1:26:05] on 2 in Jeffersonville said you are
[1:26:10] Judas and he didn't win
[1:26:13] that that was God's
[1:26:17] answer okay let it go he sang of his
[1:26:20] faith with conviction Elvis was troubled
[1:26:23] by questions that seem to have no
[1:26:26] answers no answers when the
[1:26:28] storms of life are
[1:26:34] raging stand
[1:26:37] by there was nobody to stand with him
[1:26:40] when the storms was raging when the
[1:26:43] storms of life are
[1:26:48] raging stand by in your day of Calamity
[1:26:51] I will love at you your days of
[1:26:56] storm when the
[1:26:58] world is tosing
[1:27:03] me like a
[1:27:05] ship out on the
[1:27:10] sea thou who
[1:27:13] rulest when
[1:27:17] what stand by I think that Elvis thought
[1:27:21] that he'd wake up and find that it was
[1:27:23] all over with you know it was just it
[1:27:25] was just a dream when I'm
[1:27:27] gr and when he woke
[1:27:32] up it was not only a deem a reality
[1:27:34] according to the prophet of the hour
[1:27:37] he'll tell you where Elvis woke
[1:27:40] up oh here's a quote here brother Bram
[1:27:44] says Alvis will walk up to the judgment
[1:27:47] and all his records will be plain for
[1:27:49] him as he walks up to the judgment
[1:27:54] oh I
[1:27:56] wish but I walk up to the throne of
[1:27:59] God that all my
[1:28:03] messages will be bluring out in front of
[1:28:06] my
[1:28:08] God and I tried my best I tried my best
[1:28:13] I tried my
[1:28:16] best young people I'm trying my best
[1:28:20] [Applause]
[1:28:33] he'd wake up and found that it was all
[1:28:34] over with you know it just it was just a
[1:28:36] dream when I'm
[1:28:38] growing
[1:28:42] old you didn't grow old
[1:28:45] [Music]
[1:28:51] and when I'm growing
[1:28:56] though his most Ardent fans felt he
[1:28:58] could do no wrong Elvis was well aware
[1:29:00] of his shortcomings and grew
[1:29:02] increasingly uncomfortable with the
[1:29:04] agulation lavished upon
[1:29:08] [Music]
[1:29:12] him look at
[1:29:16] this he frequently read the Bible and
[1:29:19] often prayed with those around him one
[1:29:22] you read the word
[1:29:25] from now onward ministers don't tell me
[1:29:27] about the word the word the word tell me
[1:29:29] about the Holy Ghost that leads you to
[1:29:30] the word then I'll start listening to
[1:29:32] you Elvis also read the word Judas also
[1:29:35] read the
[1:29:36] [Applause]
[1:29:43] word he frequently read the Bible and
[1:29:45] often prayed with those around him one
[1:29:48] notable example was the evening he
[1:29:50] learned that Sylvia shenell a member of
[1:29:52] his background group the Sweet
[1:29:54] Inspirations received news that she had
[1:29:57] been diagnosed with cancer we got to
[1:30:00] Vegas and as we he prayed he touched
[1:30:04] Sylvia's stomach and he asked God to
[1:30:06] move whatever it
[1:30:07] was just take it
[1:30:10] away and the next morning when syvia
[1:30:13] reported to Sunrise Hospital there in
[1:30:15] Las Vegas they did the test and it was
[1:30:19] gone whatever it was whether it was a
[1:30:22] misdiagnosis
[1:30:24] or whether God had healed Sylvia through
[1:30:27] Elvis's faith and our
[1:30:31] faith I don't know but we believed and
[1:30:34] Elvis believed also that God had worked
[1:30:37] a miracle through him he would
[1:30:40] discuss Elvis read the word Elvis
[1:30:45] prayed and Elvis had a Healing
[1:30:51] Ministry but the holy ghost thing
[1:30:56] he admitted that he hasn't got
[1:31:05] it
[1:31:07] okay faith and our
[1:31:10] faith I don't know but we believed and
[1:31:14] all us believed also that God had worked
[1:31:17] a miracle from him he would discuss
[1:31:20] spiritual ideas with us and I remember
[1:31:23] that we were standing in a circle one
[1:31:27] night and this was in
[1:31:30] Vegas and he said I want you all to
[1:31:33] close your eyes he said we're going to
[1:31:35] we weren't going to pray but he just
[1:31:37] said I want you to close your eyes and I
[1:31:38] was thinking in my mind I'll never
[1:31:40] forget this I was going to say Elvis
[1:31:42] what do you think about heaven I was
[1:31:43] going to ask him what he thought about
[1:31:45] heaven and I had my eyes closed and he
[1:31:48] said Jim we're going to get to that just
[1:31:50] a
[1:31:51] moment and I open my eyes and he and I
[1:31:54] said to what he said you were going to
[1:31:56] ask me about heaven weren't you and I
[1:31:58] said yeah he even had
[1:32:07] discernment and you people in the
[1:32:09] message says well brother OS who's got
[1:32:10] discernment he's a prophet no Elvis also
[1:32:13] had it and you must have it each
[1:32:16] individual must have
[1:32:17] [Music]
[1:32:20] discernment that's thus sayth the Lord
[1:32:23] because brother Bron said it in
[1:32:25] discernment of
[1:32:28] spirits and Discerning the Lord's
[1:32:31] body okay my brother discuss spiritual
[1:32:35] ideas with us and I remember that we
[1:32:37] were standing in a circle one
[1:32:40] [Music]
[1:32:41] night and this was in
[1:32:44] Vegas and he said I want you all to
[1:32:47] close your eyes he said we're going to
[1:32:49] we weren't going to pray but he just
[1:32:51] said I want you to close your eyes and I
[1:32:52] was thinking in my mind I'll never
[1:32:54] forget this I was going to say Elvis
[1:32:56] what do you think about heaven I was
[1:32:58] going to ask him what he thought about
[1:32:59] heaven and I had my eyes closed and he
[1:33:02] said Jim we're going to get to that just
[1:33:04] a
[1:33:05] moment and I opened my eyes and he and I
[1:33:08] said to what he said you were going to
[1:33:10] ask me about heaven weren't you and I
[1:33:12] said yeah he said we'll get that in just
[1:33:14] a minute that blew me away I don't know
[1:33:19] how how that happened Elvis is very
[1:33:22] spiritual
[1:33:24] he uh believed that he had a certain
[1:33:26] connection with God not so much more
[1:33:28] than anybody else listen closely because
[1:33:31] when I come up to the quotes it's all
[1:33:33] that brother brandham saw even before
[1:33:36] she spoke about
[1:33:38] this and then you'll believe there's a
[1:33:40] prophet in the
[1:33:44] land and the apostolic gift will amen
[1:33:47] that Prophet around every day
[1:33:56] okay brother Elvis was very
[1:33:59] spiritual he uh believed that he had a
[1:34:01] certain connection with God not so much
[1:34:04] more than anybody else did but in his
[1:34:07] search he was trying to get close to God
[1:34:09] so in his
[1:34:12] search and
[1:34:15] Judas what did Judas do for
[1:34:21] repentance he tried his utmost place to
[1:34:25] get
[1:34:26] repentance he was searching for God and
[1:34:28] he yet
[1:34:30] religious there's no way you can find
[1:34:32] god brother briam says God works through
[1:34:35] a
[1:34:36] Ministry only way God works there's
[1:34:39] where you'll
[1:34:42] finding okay brother with God not so
[1:34:45] much more than anybody else did but in
[1:34:49] his search he was trying to get close to
[1:34:51] God so he felt that by helping others
[1:34:54] maybe that was his Elvis had even the
[1:34:58] revelation of
[1:35:02] others God made me preach before we got
[1:35:05] this
[1:35:08] [Applause]
[1:35:16] video but in his
[1:35:18] search he was trying to get close to God
[1:35:21] so he felt that by helping others
[1:35:25] maybe that was his mission and I
[1:35:27] remember just looking at him and I said
[1:35:29] man you are really really blessed and I
[1:35:33] said you know as great as this album is
[1:35:36] and all the success you
[1:35:39] have I said you know God is the one who
[1:35:42] made all this possible I said God has
[1:35:44] placed you in a unique situation and I
[1:35:47] said you know you are really blessed and
[1:35:50] he turned to me and he said you know I
[1:35:52] know that huh and I know that I couldn't
[1:35:55] have done it without God and that just
[1:35:59] keep that one also in mind you'll hear
[1:36:02] what brother brandham
[1:36:06] says okay brother and all this possible
[1:36:10] I said God has placed you in a unique
[1:36:13] situation and I said you know you are
[1:36:17] really blessed and he turned to me and
[1:36:18] he said you know I know that and I know
[1:36:22] that I couldn't have done it without God
[1:36:25] and that just you know a lot of people
[1:36:27] think that he was insensitive to it but
[1:36:29] he realized that everything that came to
[1:36:33] him came from God and he and he
[1:36:36] cherished it that that way his friends
[1:36:39] noted that Elvis was often confused
[1:36:41] about why God had allowed him such
[1:36:43] success in a clan yet he never
[1:36:45] questioned that his gifts were from God
[1:36:48] perhaps that's why the song He Touched
[1:36:50] Me was particularly meaningful to his
[1:36:55] the hand of
[1:36:57] Jesus touched
[1:37:02] me and now I am
[1:37:10] no I'm not here today to make him an
[1:37:13] angel I'm not here to make him a saint
[1:37:15] and I'm just telling you the truth and
[1:37:16] how he was and he but I read believe
[1:37:19] this whole deep this deep Foundation
[1:37:22] that his mother had these deep roots in
[1:37:24] the
[1:37:25] church uh gave Ela something to shoot
[1:37:28] for
[1:37:29] maybe
[1:37:32] something
[1:37:34] happen and
[1:37:36] now I
[1:37:38] know he touch
[1:37:40] [Music]
[1:37:47] me concert he just called us out to do
[1:37:50] it in the concert nobody knew nothing
[1:37:52] about it none of us knew we going to do
[1:37:54] it at all it just sort of an impromptu
[1:37:57] thing but I think it was it really put
[1:37:59] us kind of put us on the map so to speak
[1:38:02] I mean it kind of put us after the
[1:38:04] concer where people knew who we were

[1:41:34] with them I cannot sing with them I

[1:42:55] [Applause]
[1:43:06] though he sang of his faith with
[1:43:07] conviction Elvis was troubled by
[1:43:10] questions that seemed to have no answers
[1:43:13] listen to the song there must be lights
[1:43:17] burning
[1:43:18] brighter

[1:46:33] Jefferson Bol the sun deep sign because
[1:46:35] it is the rising of the
[1:46:38] sun

[1:47:27] backslid you went to the
[1:47:30] world and you left

[1:48:17] the
[1:48:19] funeral they will tell you how I
[1:48:21] preached
[1:48:23] I felt if Elvis could give his all for
[1:48:26] the devil what's wrong with that
[1:48:37] garage at the
[1:48:38] beginning Elvis couldn't see anything

[1:49:22] sweep through the minds of the young
[1:49:24] people by his
[1:49:28] music the 60s started

[1:57:13] talking about if Elvis had the baptism
[1:57:15] of the Holy Ghost and he couldn't say he

[2:00:37] he'll make them sing right through the
[2:00:39] night until the next morning to try and

[2:05:13] Ghana not into uh Zimbabwe not into
[2:05:16] England not into Germany but go into
[2:05:19] South Africa
[2:05:23] going to South Africa and they were so
[2:05:26] why Elvis Presley is a very religious
[2:05:29] boy did you hear that on the video he
[2:05:33] the prophet brings in 1964 Elvis press
[2:05:36] is a very religious boy he sings hymns
[2:05:40] oh that doesn't mean nothing to me it's
[2:05:43] another Judas es
[2:05:46] scariot all the nice hymns that he sang
[2:05:50] all the good How Great Thou Art amen the
[2:05:53] devil also knows how great he
[2:05:56] [Applause]
[2:05:58] is that don't make him a
[2:06:06] Christian if Elvis prey was a Christian
[2:06:09] why did he die of
[2:06:15] drugs his music took him to drugs
[2:06:22] and maybe that same music will take them
[2:06:24] to
[2:06:29] Armageddon right in South Africa here in
[2:06:32] South Africa they say he's religious you
[2:06:33] know he sings religious songs and and
[2:06:35] and and and you know and you listen here
[2:06:38] not all over in South Africa not here
[2:06:40] here we say what the prophet says he is
[2:06:43] a incarnate devil
[2:06:55] yes he
[2:06:56] is handwriting on the wall 1958 and
[2:07:00] Elvis Presley and make a little album or
[2:07:03] some kind of a religious service right
[2:07:06] after the meetings religious service
[2:07:09] rock and roll on one side and religion
[2:07:12] on the other
[2:07:15] side the prophet knew Alva sang
[2:07:18] religious songs and with who did he sing
[2:07:21] it
[2:07:22] bugat
[2:07:25] there now now shook his his
[2:07:30] hips and just now real sad and singing
[2:07:33] one song he gave the whole night for the
[2:07:36] devil and he gave a little two minutes
[2:07:38] for
[2:07:41] God my God needs all the time
[2:07:52] either you serve God or you don't serve
[2:07:54] him at all either you do what God wants
[2:07:57] you to do or you don't do it at all
[2:07:59] young people either you serve God or set
[2:08:02] it home until you made up your mind that
[2:08:04] it's not one side the world and one side
[2:08:07] God it's all Bes sides
[2:08:10] [Applause]
[2:08:17] God we making sense to the word of God
[2:08:26] Now understand why brother Brenham says
[2:08:29] and I could never understand it I'm long
[2:08:31] in the message and that doesn't mean
[2:08:33] that I'm saved because I'm long in the I
[2:08:35] must fight the
[2:08:36] fight but I'm just saying that to make a
[2:08:40] point I could never understand the
[2:08:42] unentertained Christ Jesus with dir fet
[2:08:45] where he says that these singers they
[2:08:47] keep in the note until they blew in the
[2:08:49] face and I said Lord who is is he
[2:08:51] speaking about why does he say that
[2:08:54] until I saw this video they were right
[2:08:56] there when brother Brenham was there and
[2:08:58] brother Brenham saw them amen singing
[2:09:01] amen hymns with uh Elvis Presley and
[2:09:04] brother Brenham nailed Elvis Presley and
[2:09:05] he turned around he says and this Bunch
[2:09:08] that keeps that breath in so long to
[2:09:10] keep the note he says they not singing
[2:09:12] for God that was not singing for God
[2:09:20] [Applause]

[2:09:29] God showed me right in there listen here
[2:09:32] this is that bigus uh concubines that
[2:09:38] brother brandham spoke about they are
[2:09:43] concubines of Elvis Presley he pregnated
[2:09:46] them with hell now they sing until tears

[2:18:55] is I will take the Bible and I will
[2:18:58] reject every other minister if he says
[2:19:01] that Elvis is saved I'll say no he

[2:19:45] convictions after when he couldn't find
[2:19:47] repentance
[2:20:01] the best thing to give drugs is the best
[2:20:04] thing to give up drugs is never to start
[2:20:07] with
[2:20:14] it I won't be able to help you when you
[2:20:17] cross that line
[2:20:28] loving kindness and Alvis prey with his
[2:20:31] All Shook Up rock and roll the reason
[2:20:34] you do it because something in there
[2:20:37] making and craving for that if the Holy
[2:20:40] Ghost
[2:20:42] hand had that heart fold you wouldn't
[2:20:46] have no desire for Alvis fres and his
[2:20:49] rock and roll there BR puts the things
[2:20:53] straight and the Holy Ghost is there
[2:20:55] your desires are
[2:20:58] [Applause]
[2:21:11] changed God keeps his word 57 I do not
[2:21:15] like to call people's names but I'm
[2:21:18] going to call somebody somebody his name
[2:21:21] now but I pray for the young man and I
[2:21:24] pray all the time for him but he is a
[2:21:28] instrument in the hands of the devil and
[2:21:31] that is this man Elvis Presley the
[2:21:34] people are gone Boogie hooi and rock and
[2:21:36] roll
[2:21:38] wild I like church music played like
[2:21:41] church music and not rock and roll in
[2:21:44] the church but when they
[2:21:47] get the spirit there's something
[2:21:50] something behind this you see I said the
[2:21:52] spirit there's something behind that
[2:21:54] Spirit whether it's soft music and nice
[2:21:57] hymns there's a spirit behind it you're
[2:21:58] doing that because you don't like the
[2:22:00] Holy Ghost that's why you like that soft
[2:22:02] music because you don't like dancing
[2:22:05] that's why you don't want the church to
[2:22:06] dance there's a spirit behind it with
[2:22:10] your soft HS message
[2:22:16] Pastor I pull no punches and I have no
[2:22:20] Reg
[2:22:21] [Applause]
[2:22:31] RS so like for there's something behind
[2:22:35] this and the devil puts himself out a
[2:22:38] challenge and it happens to be that this
[2:22:41] poor backslid Pentecostal boy shaking he
[2:22:45] caught it and learned it in church he is
[2:22:48] a member of the first Assemblies of God
[2:22:51] in Memphis Tennessee his Pastor is a
[2:22:54] friend of mine and he is the devil's
[2:22:56] instrument for delting and polluting the
[2:22:59] minds of the
[2:23:02] teenagers that's why I said this is for
[2:23:04] the young
[2:23:05] people polluting the minds of the young
[2:23:10] people they just left the place in
[2:23:13] Canada and I think they sent 14 young
[2:23:15] people to the insane asylum a few days
[2:23:18] after he was there
[2:23:22] they went
[2:23:27] cuckoo when to get this quotes and

[2:46:02] Jackson the two have become one the one
[2:46:06] started it the other one finished
[2:46:10] it the one came with the name of
[2:46:13] brandham and the other one came in the
[2:46:16] name of a man that's called the Apostle
[2:46:19] of God could only come

[2:46:27] the truth
[2:46:38] [Applause]
[2:47:13] [Applause]
[2:47:17] right in the hour right in the
[2:47:21] hour where a
[2:47:23] Ministry came by Revelation and preached
[2:47:27] Michael and open up Michael a fire4
[2:47:32] minister amen and went around the world
[2:47:35] and place
[2:47:37] Michael right at that hour right at that
[2:47:41] time now I spoke about Michael years
[2:47:45] ago and I was first down by the
[2:47:49] ministers because they didn't know
[2:47:51] Christ the mystery and I read it right
[2:47:52] in Christ the mystery and I said it and
[2:47:54] they said where did he get it from even
[2:47:56] up till now they said where does he get
[2:47:57] it
[2:48:00] from but if you're not call on my realm
[2:48:03] it's up to you I preach according to my
[2:48:07] [Applause]
[2:48:15] faith Elvis Presley could only move his
[2:48:19] pis because he was Elvis pis but Michael
[2:48:23] Jackson moves his toes until his head he
[2:48:28] could go like this and there's nobody
[2:48:31] they said never will there ever be a man
[2:48:34] that will be able to dance like Michael
[2:48:39] [Applause]
[2:48:42] Jackson any brother Brandon felt like
[2:48:45] that about Alvis how would he have felt
[2:48:47] about Michael Jackson
[2:48:53] and the same thing that God spoke about
[2:48:56] Elvis it speaks about Michael
[2:49:03] Jackson have we got
[2:49:10] it I was amazed when I saw him dancing
[2:49:13] now you said did you watch it I'll watch
[2:49:15] it because I want to preach on it I
[2:49:16] never knew it and brother and watched
[2:49:19] Elvis and he knew what Elvis sang and
[2:49:21] who sang with Elvis that's why he could
[2:49:23] preach against
[2:49:25] it brother Bram says even the Beatles
[2:49:28] they are
[2:49:29] healers and he made one of the brothers
[2:49:31] read a cut out of Readers Digest how the
[2:49:34] Beatles healed
