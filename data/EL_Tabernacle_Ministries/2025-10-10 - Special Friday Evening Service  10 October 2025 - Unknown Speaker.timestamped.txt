[0:04] Shalom saints.
[0:06] Can we turn to Psalm 1919?
[0:15] If you add it,
[0:17] the heavens declare the glory of God,
[0:20] his handiwork. Day unto day utter
[0:23] speech, and night unto night show with
[0:25] knowledge. There is no speech nor
[0:27] language where the voice is not heard.
[0:31] Their line is gone out through all the
[0:33] earth and the words to the end of the
[0:36] world. In them as he set a tabernacle
[0:40] for a son wishes as a bridegroom coming
[0:43] out of his chamber and rejoices as a
[0:46] strong man to run a race. His going
[0:49] forth is from the end of heaven,
[0:52] and his circuit unto the end of it, and
[0:55] there is nothing from the heat thereof.
[0:58] The law of the Lord is perfect,
[1:01] converting the soul.
[1:03] &gt;&gt; The testimony of the Lord is sure,
[1:05] making wise the simple. The statutes of
[1:08] the Lord are right, rejoicing his heart,
[1:11] the heart. The commandment of the Lord
[1:14] is pure, is pure, enlightening the eyes.
[1:18] The fear of the Lord is clean, enduring
[1:21] forever. The judgment of the Lord are
[1:24] true and righteousness altogether. More
[1:28] to be desired are they than gold, yay,
[1:31] than much fine gold. Sweeter also than
[1:34] the honey and the honeycomb.
[1:37] Moreover, by them is thy servant worn.
[1:41] And in keeping of them there is great
[1:44] reward.
[1:45] &gt;&gt; Who can understand his errors? Cleanse
[1:48] thou me from secret faults.
[1:51] &gt;&gt; Keep back thy servant also from
[1:52] presumptions of my mouth and the
[1:55] meditation of my heart be acceptable in
[1:57] my sight. Oh Lord, my strength and my
[2:00] redeemer. Amen.
[2:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[2:11] What a beautiful psalm.
[2:15] Hallelujah.
[2:18] If you have a need tonight,
[2:21] there's elders
[2:23] while they prepare themselves. Let's
[2:25] just wave our hands.
[2:29] &gt;&gt; We have a shepherd tonight.
[2:31] &gt;&gt; He goes before me.
[2:34] &gt;&gt; He goes before me.
[2:39] &gt;&gt; Just wave your defender behind me.
[2:43] Defender behind me.
[2:48] &gt;&gt; Oh,
[2:50] I won't fear.
[2:52] &gt;&gt; I won't
[2:54] fear.
[2:56] &gt;&gt; I'm filled with anointing.
[3:00] &gt;&gt; I'm filled with anointing.
[3:05] &gt;&gt; And my cup's overflowing.
[3:08] My love's overflowing.
[3:14] &gt;&gt; No weapon can harm me.
[3:17] &gt;&gt; No weapon can harm me.
[3:21] &gt;&gt; Oh
[3:24] say
[3:26] I want thee.
[3:33] We sing hallelujah.
[3:40] I alone.
[3:49] &gt;&gt; He's my comfort.
[3:54] He's my comfort.
[4:01] [Music]
[4:06] &gt;&gt; He always guides me. You always guide me
[4:14] through mountains and valleys
[4:18] and
[4:19] [Music]
[4:22] his joy is refreshing.
[4:25] [Music]
[4:30] &gt;&gt; He restores my soul.

[9:32] It's good to be in this house
[9:37] and we look forward to our father
[9:39] speaking to us.
[9:41] So, let me do my part. Get out of the
[9:44] way so we can all be blessed tonight.
[9:48] Please allow me greet every brother,
[9:51] sister in the beautiful name of Jesus
[9:53] Christ.
[9:55] Please allow me to read the prayer
[9:56] request. We give God a wonderful hand.
[10:00] Then we read a prayer request. We pray
[10:03] and get out of the way.
[10:06] Thankful. God bless you saints. I would
[10:08] like to thank the Lord.
[10:11] Uh
[10:13] this night I made my request known to
[10:16] God before the saints. I was writing
[10:19] this week from Tuesday until today. On
[10:22] Sunday, I submitted a prayer request for
[10:25] God to undertake for me since I was
[10:28] scared and panicking. The Lord is good.
[10:33] All these four days, I could come out of
[10:36] the test room with an hallelujah in my
[10:39] heart because he was there to see me
[10:43] through. Sister Michelle,
[10:46] greetings, saints. I'd like to wish my
[10:48] wife sister Paulina as it was her
[10:51] birthday yesterday. May Jehovah Rosco
[10:54] bless you more with a double portion in
[10:57] your heart desires
[10:59] from your brother Richard.
[11:02] God bless saints. We just want to thank
[11:04] the Lord for safe traveling mercies from
[11:07] Bloom Fontaine to Joek. We're so
[11:09] grateful and thankful sister Louisa.
[11:13] Greetings saints. I would like to thank
[11:16] the great Lord Almighty Jesus King God
[11:20] for his hand of golden grace and
[11:22] healing. I had a major complication with
[11:25] my health a month ago, but the Lord was
[11:28] merciful.
[11:30] I'm currently on my way to a full
[11:32] recovery.
[11:34] All thanks to the God we serve.
[11:42] God turned my impossible situation
[11:48] into a possible possible one. Thanks for
[11:53] safe traveling mercies. Sister Mary from
[11:56] Cape Town. Can we give the Lord a
[11:59] wonderful hand? He's good to us. He
[12:03] cares for us. He provides our every
[12:07] need. and is only a prayer away.
[12:12] We believe. We believe.
[12:15] And whatsoever you have need of tonight,
[12:17] if thou can believe, all things are
[12:20] possible. Prayer requests.
[12:23] We would like to greet the saints in the
[12:25] name of Jovarosco. Please pray for me as
[12:28] I'm not feeling well. In the body from
[12:31] Sate,
[12:33] will the saints please remember us in
[12:35] prayer as we handed our CS in for jobs.
[12:38] God bless Bro Andre. I greet you all in
[12:41] the wonderful name of our Lord and
[12:42] Savior Jesus Christ. Can the saints
[12:45] please pray for my grandmother who is
[12:47] not well in the body and in a hospital.
[12:51] I know when the saints begin to pray,
[12:54] God will make a way for her, Sister
[12:56] Lameisa.
[12:58] Please pray for Ethan who has to go for
[13:02] surgery to remove a fast growing tumor.
[13:06] Please pray for Jehovah Rafa to hear him
[13:10] and be with him during the operation.
[13:12] God bless. Stay still. Greetings saints
[13:15] in Jesus' name. I would like to request
[13:19] prayer for God to please make a way for
[13:21] me to be absorbed in my current company
[13:25] and receive a permanent job, your
[13:27] brother in Christ. Please pray for my
[13:31] upcoming final test and exam.
[13:34] I seem to struggle a lot with
[13:36] remembering the things I study during
[13:39] the exam room.
[13:42] Uh
[13:44] the things I study during the exams, no
[13:48] matter how well and how much I study, I
[13:52] deeply ask for your prayers from your
[13:54] sister. God bless. Please pray for my
[13:57] son who is in prison and a lot is going
[14:01] on in his life now. I know when the
[14:03] saints begin to pray, Jehovah Rosco will
[14:06] make away your sister in Christ your
[14:09] envelope
[14:10] for prayer from sister Lameis.
[14:15] Uh, greetings in the name of Jehovah.
[14:17] Please remember in prayer my neck and
[14:20] shoulder and body is full of pains. I
[14:23] believe when the saints begin to pray,
[14:26] God will heal me completely. your sister
[14:30] in Christ, Sister Felicia Lane. If you
[14:33] have a request, if you have a need,
[14:37] I can only remind you
[14:42] that early this morning, our friend went
[14:44] in
[14:45] and he prayed for us.
[14:49] And I just come to be a little better
[14:52] behind him.
[14:55] So, lift up your hearts, lift up your
[14:57] hands, don't be weary.
[15:00] know that we have a friend.
[15:03] A righteous man's reward is with our
[15:06] friend.
[15:08] Let us pray. Kind one,
[15:11] lovely one, beautiful one. Lord, thou
[15:15] art our God, our father. We come to you
[15:19] in confidence. We come to you knowing
[15:22] that you are alive. We come to you Lord
[15:26] knowing that in this house you are a
[15:29] present tense God. You are not a God of
[15:31] history Lord but oh God the testimonies
[15:36] the living testimonies are walking
[15:38] amongst us Lord as the angels has
[15:41] touched many and even tonight the angels
[15:44] are walking up and down the aisles
[15:47] touching your children. Oh God, our
[15:50] prayer is Lord, manifest what your
[15:53] apostle prayed for already this morning.
[15:56] Lord, as I lay my hands on the request
[15:59] that I've made known, doubtless thou art
[16:03] our father and I believe, Lord, may they
[16:06] come back with a testimony, giving glory
[16:09] to you, Lord, bless your apostle, our
[16:12] friend. Lord, energize his body tonight,
[16:16] oh God, as he brings the unsearchable
[16:19] riches of God to us. Lord, bless also
[16:23] the house of Rosco. Bless the
[16:26] priesthood, Lord. Bless from the
[16:28] youngest to the oldest in the household
[16:30] of Rosco. Bless your children, oh God.
[16:34] As we come together in this house to
[16:36] bring glory to you, may the praises go
[16:39] up higher and higher and higher tonight,
[16:42] oh God, in the name of Jesus, King God.
[16:45] Amen.
[16:46] [Music]
[16:58] Oh my
[17:00] appreciate our elders tonight.
[17:04] Hallelujah.
[17:06] Do you feel like going on tonight?

[17:18] going on.
[17:22] Oh, I feel
[17:24] like
[17:26] like going
[17:28] on.
[17:30] Don't you feel like that?
[17:32] Though trials
[17:36] come
[17:38] on every
[17:41] man
[17:43] I feel love.
[17:46] I wonder this time we can welcome our
[17:48] senior pastor Jonathan Rosco.
[17:51] Oh, I feel
[17:53] &gt;&gt; I feel
[17:57] [Music]
[18:00] [Applause]
[18:03] I feel

[18:29] Do you feel like going on?
[18:32] [Applause]
[18:33] [Music]
[18:36] You ought to forget about your trials.
[18:41] You made it to the house of the Lord.
[18:45] [Music]
[18:48] Amen.
[18:50] [Music]
[18:52] Brother, sister, you may be seated
[18:54] today.
[18:56] [Music]
[19:03] Praise the Lord.
[19:06] We um just want to tell the church
[19:10] about four testimonies
[19:13] that God has done in this time
[19:17] which is resounding
[19:20] beyond explanation
[19:24] and
[19:26] it's just gives us faith to believe no
[19:29] matter what.
[19:35] God is in charge of everything. Amen.
[19:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. There's a policeman in Bora. Do
[19:43] you know what's his name?
[19:46] High ranking policeman.
[19:50] Amen. Can you stand to your feet? I saw
[19:52] him come in earlier.
[19:55] God bless you.
[19:58] I was supposed to give this testimony.
[20:01] Thank you, my brother.
[20:03] We were in Ptoria. The man of God was
[20:07] pressed by the Holy Ghost to get to
[20:10] Ptoria on a Tuesday night
[20:13] and he was dealing with cases
[20:18] and the atmosphere was resounding. It
[20:21] was God in the house although the church
[20:25] was not there
[20:27] but God was at the church.
[20:34] And my precious brother came in, heard
[20:37] that the apostle was
[20:39] in the house of Al Tabernacle on the
[20:42] hill.
[20:43] [Music]
[20:44] And the doctors
[20:46] checked his heart
[20:49] and he was supposed to get a booking to
[20:51] do something on the heart.
[20:54] And the man was shook up because they
[20:56] checked them all the time because in the
[20:58] police force they check them and he was
[21:01] getting himself ready for an operation.
[21:05] But they the devil lost out because the
[21:09] doctor was at the church
[21:14] [Applause]
[21:16] and he said, "Uh, I don't know how am I
[21:19] going to get this booking. There's no
[21:20] place to get me a booking." He got the
[21:23] booking
[21:25] and the doctor checked him and he says,
[21:26] "You got a baby heart
[21:29] after the apostle prayed."
[21:31] [Applause]
[21:34] From a problem
[21:36] to a miracle. It was an instant miracle.
[21:41] [Applause]
[21:49] I know he'll never be the same again
[21:51] because that was God.
[21:54] [Music]
[22:01] He believed that if the apostle he came
[22:03] to the house and he knew the apostle was
[22:07] there and he knew if the apostle pray
[22:09] for him, he won't need an op. And God
[22:13] gave him a baby. The doctor was confused
[22:18] and he's still here. Amen. Am I right,
[22:21] my brother?
[22:23] There's a man with the testimony.
[22:29] Amen. Then brother Daniel,
[22:31] the electrician
[22:34] wife had to go for ops
[22:36] and the last op was quite serious with
[22:39] the cancer.
[22:41] Came for prayer.
[22:43] God made a way.
[22:48] You will ask
[22:50] and God will give it.
[22:54] Normally when the cancer spreads in the
[22:57] woman, it goes to the organs. It goes
[23:00] all over. But God made a way.
[23:06] Then the devil wasn't happy with the
[23:08] testimony.
[23:09] Then brother Daniel was busy grinding to
[23:12] make a carport at home
[23:15] and the ladder swept out under him and
[23:19] the grinder cut him here near the
[23:21] juggler pipe. When he got to the
[23:24] hospital it was already bubbling here.
[23:27] The doctors could not believe the man
[23:29] was alive
[23:31] but there was a god in the house.
[23:37] Instead of a funeral, instead of the
[23:39] juggler pipe, God stopped him to die and
[23:43] bleed to death. The grinder cut him, but
[23:47] God was in here. And God saved him. God
[23:51] made a way for him. And I want to tell
[23:54] you tonight, he can make a way for you
[23:56] also.
[23:58] You just got to believe
[24:00] in a man.
[24:02] All things are possible.
[24:10] Praise the Lord.
[24:13] But the strike foster phoned me
[24:16] to say his wife needs to go for an
[24:18] operation. They detected cancer in her
[24:21] breast.
[24:23] And I told the apostle, the apostle told
[24:25] me, "Jaw." The apostle calls me Jaw.
[24:29] It's my house name.
[24:30] &gt;&gt; Jo. She'll be all right.
[24:36] I just said it to him. The apostle told
[24:39] me she'll be all right. Now, I'm here
[24:42] tonight to tell you she went in the
[24:46] Tuesday, the Wednesday, she was home.
[24:50] All things are possible if you believe
[24:53] there's a God, a doctor, a physician in
[24:58] this house.
[25:00] God bless you.
[25:02] Let's give the Lord a hand of praise and
[25:05] you can go home with an answer as well.
[25:15] [Applause]
[25:17] [Music]
[25:21] We should be running around this place.
[25:25] Hey.
[25:28] Hey,
[25:32] Dr. Los.
[25:35] [Applause]
[25:38] [Music]
[25:44] Somebody say hallelujah.
[25:47] Somebody say hosana.
[25:49] [Applause]
[25:52] [Music]
[25:55] Woo.
[25:56] [Applause]
[26:03] We just want to use this opportunity to
[26:05] welcome
[26:07] all the visitors
[26:11] in the house of Rosco.
[26:15] There's a very special gentleman,
[26:18] Mr. Desmond Gil. He's one of the top
[26:21] golfers that plays with the morning
[26:23] stars in our midst.
[26:25] We want to acknowledge you and we want
[26:27] to welcome you
[26:29] and may you enjoy yourself.

[38:02] This is the night
[38:06] and the day
[38:09] &gt;&gt; when the King of glory
[38:11] [Applause]
[38:12] &gt;&gt; cried out,
[38:15] &gt;&gt; "It is finished.
[38:17] Lord, I am finished.
[38:20] It is finished.

[39:02] to one place to be here tonight.
[39:19] Amen.
[39:21] &gt;&gt; Anyway, we together again
[39:25] &gt;&gt; just praising the Lord.
[39:31] And
[39:34] if we have visitors here
[39:37] &gt;&gt; and you don't understand why we're
[39:39] making such a lot of noise,
[39:43] &gt;&gt; we just want to tell you,
[39:46] &gt;&gt; we're excited about that man.
[40:05] We uh
[40:08] we came back a little late last week
[40:11] after the party and then
[40:14] I relax and I
[40:17] put on football. Uh that's my
[40:20] my weak spot
[40:23] &gt;&gt; and uh yet Chelsea
[40:27] and Liverpool
[40:29] &gt;&gt; was playing.
[40:32] And brothers and sisters, it was
[40:36] it was chaos.
[40:39] It was total madness
[40:44] &gt;&gt; because a little Brazilian on the last
[40:47] minute
[40:50] scored the winning goal.
[40:54] &gt;&gt; And when that ball went in, I sat back.
[40:56] I said, "Now I want to see
[41:00] the spectators
[41:02] or the bartakers."
[41:05] I didn't see any spectators.
[41:09] I only saw bartakers. They were jumping.
[41:22] But
[41:25] &gt;&gt; but don't tell J
[41:29] I was one of them that was jumping
[41:32] cuz I'm glad those guys lost.
[41:35] [Applause]
[41:40] But the thing hit me again once more.
[41:43] They could jump like that for a piece of
[41:46] leather.
[41:51] What about us?
[41:58] Why can't we jump?
[42:00] [Applause]
[42:20] and especially
[42:26] &gt;&gt; to the one
[42:30] &gt;&gt; that conquered
[42:31] [Applause]
[42:33] &gt;&gt; hell,
[42:35] &gt;&gt; dead,
[42:36] and the grave.
[42:42] [Applause]
[43:03] Bullmont.
[43:05] [Applause]
[43:31] Amen.
[43:33] &gt;&gt; Okay. Jonathan told you about
[43:37] those miracles that took place.
[43:40] &gt;&gt; But I heard about
[43:43] Father Kirkwin's wife, Mercedes.
[43:49] &gt;&gt; She had a very, very bad kidney problem
[43:52] and they wanted to put her on dialysis.
[44:04] Hallelujah.
[44:05] &gt;&gt; And when she went, I think a week or two
[44:08] ago,
[44:10] they checked her up
[44:12] and they can't believe it
[44:18] that the kidneys is more stronger than
[44:20] ever.
[44:35] There's a God in this church.
[44:47] [Applause]
[44:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:02] So I thank God for the healing
[45:08] &gt;&gt; and um
[45:11] I just like to thank the um
[45:14] trustees wives and
[45:17] that when I come to church there's some
[45:20] coffee for me behind in the minister's
[45:23] room.
[45:25] Now I don't have a buffazi.
[45:29] [Applause]
[45:32] &gt;&gt; So when I come
[45:36] most of the time
[45:39] they come through
[45:44] but when I come here
[45:47] I get a nice cappuccino.
[45:53] God bless you
[46:03] as you go out of your way.
[46:06] If I am a man of God,
[46:10] &gt;&gt; now listen,
[46:13] &gt;&gt; listen.
[46:14] I'm here 62 years.
[46:18] &gt;&gt; I never came for your woman.
[46:21] I can look at every woman straight in
[46:23] the eye here.
[46:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:26] &gt;&gt; I never came for your woman.
[46:32] &gt;&gt; 62 here.
[46:36] &gt;&gt; And you guys that's got some money in
[46:38] the bank. I know all of you. I never one
[46:42] time knock at your door for money.
[46:44] [Applause]
[46:46] &gt;&gt; So I also didn't come for your money.
[46:51] But I came
[46:54] &gt;&gt; to see you Hello.
[47:05] Ready?
[47:14] [Applause]
[47:41] And then
[47:43] it's brother Julian. Yeah.
[47:47] Julian
[47:50] Bolton.
[47:57] Julian who move you to after 8 you know
[48:00] I just hope that uh that's not
[48:04] backsliding you know
[48:10] I want to thank Julian
[48:13] and brother Charles's wife
[48:16] for the printing of the books I never
[48:18] even read these books so next week you
[48:20] know I've been very very busy
[48:24] &gt;&gt; so next week I have to sit now look how
[48:27] thick this book is.
[48:30] And this is my ministry.
[48:45] My heart is aching
[48:49] to go into this book.
[48:53] And Julian, I would like to know what is
[48:56] this book going to cost?
[48:59] We want to see if we can't make it
[49:01] available
[49:03] to the church
[49:07] at a reduced price.
[49:11] But everybody should have this
[49:22] As you know,
[49:25] all the books that we have printed and
[49:28] all the tapes that I made, over 3,000
[49:31] tapes, I didn't get one cent from it.
[49:36] I don't get the money.
[49:39] [Applause]
[49:47] We put it back into the works of the
[49:49] Lord.
[49:52] &gt;&gt; Then he made another book,
[49:56] the trumpets
[49:57] [Applause]
[50:02] which I didn't have an opportunity to
[50:04] get into it.
[50:07] And I think there's another book
[50:13] So, normally I knock these things off
[50:15] quickly so that they get printed, but
[50:18] they've been waiting on me. I've been in
[50:21] the pulpit most of the time,
[50:26] but I hope next week
[50:29] I'll be able to go into it
[50:32] and we'll tell you
[50:35] what it's going to cost
[50:39] and what
[50:41] we're going to reduce on it.
[50:45] So, I want to thank you, brother Julian.
[50:59] Amen.
[51:02] That concludes my
[51:08] announcements.
[51:11] And now let's get into business.
[51:16] &gt;&gt; Why we are here tonight.
[51:28] I would like to read two scriptures.
[51:32] Matthew 25:10,
[51:35] Revelations 4:1.
[51:39] And I had phone calls from all over
[51:43] &gt;&gt; just on what we already preached.
[51:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:48] &gt;&gt; And what we preach here
[51:53] &gt;&gt; is not preached anywhere.
[52:06] Psalm.
[52:09] Let us read the scripture of a message
[52:12] from the Lord.
[52:13] [Applause]
[52:16] [Music]
[52:21] [Applause]
[52:26] &gt;&gt; If you can help me to read
[52:30] Matthew 25:10. Let's read.
[52:33] [Applause]
[52:45] Watch that.
[52:50] &gt;&gt; They went into the marriage
[52:56] &gt;&gt; and the door was shut.
[52:58] &gt;&gt; That means just before the door got
[53:00] shut,
[53:02] &gt;&gt; the door was open.
[53:04] And they went in.
[53:06] [Applause]
[53:11] &gt;&gt; Went in
[53:14] with him.
[53:18] &gt;&gt; The bride and the groom
[53:23] &gt;&gt; went into the marriage with him.
[53:28] and the other five virgins
[53:32] was outside the door.
[53:35] [Applause]
[53:37] &gt;&gt; So that means right there
[53:41] the oil
[53:43] change their bodies
[53:45] [Applause]
[53:45] [Music]
[53:46] &gt;&gt; otherwise they can't go in
[53:51] &gt;&gt; the quickening power
[53:56] &gt;&gt; change their bodies.
[53:58] so that they can go in
[54:02] &gt;&gt; with the lamb.
[54:07] &gt;&gt; So before we go in,
[54:10] &gt;&gt; we need the oil, the Holy Ghost
[54:14] to quicken our bodies
[54:19] to go in.
[54:27] Amen.
[54:30] &gt;&gt; The other scripture,
[54:33] Revelations 4:1,
[54:36] read
[54:57] come up where he is.
[54:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[55:00] &gt;&gt; Again, the door was open
[55:04] &gt;&gt; and she come in.
[55:06] &gt;&gt; Same like Matthew 25.
[55:10] [Applause]
[55:34] What a thing.
[55:37] &gt;&gt; Now I want to say this.
[55:40] Let us pray first. Father,
[55:45] we are just nothing in front of you.
[55:51] &gt;&gt; Anything that we have and will have
[55:56] &gt;&gt; was because of you.
[56:03] &gt;&gt; We pray that you would undertake for us.
[56:08] Bless the people.
[56:11] &gt;&gt; Let us come this Friday night
[56:17] to be assembled together.
[56:25] &gt;&gt; We have church on a Friday night.
[56:35] Hallelujah.
[56:37] &gt;&gt; Because it all happened on a Friday.
[56:42] &gt;&gt; May you bless the word
[56:48] and may we go out here
[56:51] more wiser.
[56:55] I ask it in the name of Jesus Christ.
[57:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:05] Now,
[57:08] each one of you is here tonight,
[57:12] &gt;&gt; whether you on the streaming,
[57:15] &gt;&gt; whether you're in England, America,
[57:17] wherever this broadcast goes,
[57:21] &gt;&gt; whether you're on the streaming in South
[57:23] Africa tonight,
[57:25] &gt;&gt; each one of you,
[57:28] &gt;&gt; every one of you,
[57:31] &gt;&gt; each one of you here in the church,
[57:32] today.

[57:42] &gt;&gt; that came to church today,
[57:45] &gt;&gt; you just accepted an invitation of God.
[58:03] So give yourself a hand clap.
[58:16] &gt;&gt; You just accepted
[58:20] &gt;&gt; an invitation
[58:23] &gt;&gt; from the greatest man.
[58:26] that ever learn
[58:39] &gt;&gt; because he told you
[58:42] come unto me
[58:44] all he that labor and are heavy laden
[58:48] and I will give you rest. come an
[58:51] invitation
[58:54] and you came tonight
[58:57] accepting
[58:59] the invitation.
[59:23] Hallelujah.
[59:32] Bye.
[59:44] [Music]
[59:50] As you see that day approach on Matthew
[59:53] 25,
[59:55] &gt;&gt; see that you assemble together because
[1:00:01] it's the coming of the Lord.
[1:00:07] &gt;&gt; Assemble together.
[1:00:09] You accepted the invitation.
[1:00:14] &gt;&gt; Let us make full use of it.
[1:00:19] Amen.
[1:00:22] Amen.
[1:00:26] Amen.
[1:00:31] Hallelujah.
[1:00:37] &gt;&gt; Because Jesus,
[1:00:41] King God,
[1:00:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah,
[1:00:44] &gt;&gt; never turn down an invitation.
[1:00:50] You invite him,
[1:00:52] &gt;&gt; he'll come.
[1:00:55] &gt;&gt; He'll come.
[1:00:57] &gt;&gt; He'll come.
[1:01:00] &gt;&gt; And now we say the same thing. If you
[1:01:03] invite us,
[1:01:06] &gt;&gt; we'll be here.
[1:01:25] and therefore
[1:01:28] &gt;&gt; I chose
[1:01:32] &gt;&gt; and entitled this message
[1:01:35] &gt;&gt; the greatest
[1:01:38] &gt;&gt; message
[1:01:40] &gt;&gt; ever preached. Hallelujah.
[1:02:06] and for inspiration,
[1:02:09] the prophetic insight
[1:02:13] &gt;&gt; in Matthew 15.
[1:02:16] &gt;&gt; Now, you can't have a message
[1:02:19] &gt;&gt; unless you have a messenger.
[1:02:21] [Music]
[1:02:22] [Applause]
[1:02:31] And I know that there's a lot of
[1:02:34] messages.
[1:02:36] &gt;&gt; There's a lot of preachers
[1:02:39] &gt;&gt; in the pulpit tonight
[1:02:41] &gt;&gt; and tomorrow
[1:02:44] &gt;&gt; and Sunday.
[1:02:46] &gt;&gt; A lot of preachers.
[1:02:48] And as I told Daniel that year, I said,
[1:02:51] Daniel, you know, there's a lot of lot
[1:02:54] of preachers,
[1:02:57] &gt;&gt; in the message
[1:02:59] &gt;&gt; and in the denominations
[1:03:02] &gt;&gt; and in the churches.
[1:03:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:07] &gt;&gt; That
[1:03:09] they put there
[1:03:12] &gt;&gt; and that feed them garbage.
[1:03:16] Amen.
[1:03:17] [Applause]
[1:03:18] &gt;&gt; So if you have a preacher
[1:03:21] &gt;&gt; that feed you garbage,
[1:03:24] &gt;&gt; then you have just
[1:03:28] you just got yourself a higher killer.
[1:03:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:03:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:03:39] [Music]
[1:03:43] &gt;&gt; He is in the pulpit
[1:03:46] &gt;&gt; for ulterior motives.
[1:03:49] [Applause]
[1:03:49] [Music]
[1:03:51] &gt;&gt; He's in the pulpit to kill the church.
[1:03:55] &gt;&gt; He's in the pulpit to better himself.
[1:03:59] [Applause]
[1:04:02] &gt;&gt; And they are hired killers. Amen.
[1:04:05] &gt;&gt; They kill the children of God.
[1:04:08] &gt;&gt; And you say, "What do you mean, brother
[1:04:09] Brandham? Preach a message. I indict
[1:04:12] this generation
[1:04:14] &gt;&gt; for the second crucifixion
[1:04:17] of Jesus Christ." And the Bible says
[1:04:21] there where Jerusalem,
[1:04:25] they who the hire killers crucified the
[1:04:31] king of glory.
[1:04:33] Who crucified him? Priest
[1:04:37] &gt;&gt; hired killers,
[1:04:43] &gt;&gt; but an eel tabernacle.
[1:04:48] There is a man
[1:04:51] I can turn on the light.
[1:05:09] Say amen somebody.
[1:05:21] So,
[1:05:23] &gt;&gt; we did explain
[1:05:26] &gt;&gt; with an interview with Edgar
[1:05:29] &gt;&gt; the prophetic insight
[1:05:32] &gt;&gt; and why we're going to preach on
[1:05:35] &gt;&gt; the greatest message
[1:05:38] &gt;&gt; ever preached.
[1:05:41] Now before preaching this message,
[1:05:44] &gt;&gt; we will need tonight
[1:05:48] &gt;&gt; to have an introduction into it.
[1:05:52] &gt;&gt; It's too great
[1:05:54] and I can't I can't wait
[1:05:57] &gt;&gt; for the next meeting when I'm going to
[1:06:00] go into it.
[1:06:02] &gt;&gt; But tonight is just the introduction.
[1:06:21] So 40 years ago,
[1:06:24] I told you El Tabernacle
[1:06:28] &gt;&gt; that I do not go into the study go
[1:06:30] looking for a message.
[1:06:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:06:35] When I go into the study, I already have
[1:06:37] my message
[1:06:40] &gt;&gt; because your message comes from God.
[1:06:46] &gt;&gt; It's a inspiration from God.
[1:06:50] &gt;&gt; I already have a message.
[1:06:55] &gt;&gt; But when I go into the study,
[1:06:58] &gt;&gt; I write down my sermon.
[1:07:02] And when I come to church, I deliver the
[1:07:05] sermon. But the message come from God.
[1:07:23] &gt;&gt; That's why we sang.
[1:07:28] There is a message
[1:07:30] &gt;&gt; from the Lord. Hallelujah.
[1:07:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:07:36] &gt;&gt; A message unto you. This pooper dreams.
[1:07:51] So
[1:07:53] &gt;&gt; I need to remind you
[1:07:56] &gt;&gt; that the prophet calls
[1:07:59] all the other messages
[1:08:02] outside of Revelations 10.
[1:08:04] &gt;&gt; You'll never hear any minister preach on
[1:08:07] Revelations 10.
[1:08:09] &gt;&gt; And neither you're going to get it from
[1:08:10] a Bible school,
[1:08:13] &gt;&gt; neither from a university,
[1:08:15] &gt;&gt; neither from a professor.
[1:08:18] They don't touch Revelations 10 and they
[1:08:21] don't touch Matthew 25.
[1:08:26] But here
[1:08:28] we're in the University
[1:08:31] of eternity.
[1:08:50] And the prophet says
[1:08:53] in Revelation series 19:16,
[1:08:58] organizations
[1:09:01] and their flowery messages
[1:09:07] &gt;&gt; won't shake the devil
[1:09:10] &gt;&gt; over the head. Oh yes.
[1:09:12] &gt;&gt; Is flowery messages.
[1:09:15] &gt;&gt; People come in just the way they go out
[1:09:18] &gt;&gt; and they go out just the way they come
[1:09:20] in.
[1:09:21] &gt;&gt; Why? That flowery messages is doing
[1:09:23] nothing.
[1:09:24] &gt;&gt; We don't need flowery messages. We don't
[1:09:27] need intellectual speeches. But we need
[1:09:31] the Holy Spirit to enter in to the
[1:09:35] message and bring a shaking that it'll
[1:09:40] shake you and shake you and shake you
[1:09:43] until you get up.
[1:10:03] All that you hear on TBNN,
[1:10:07] all that you hear on the television, all
[1:10:10] that you hear right there on the radio,
[1:10:14] all that you hear in the message groups
[1:10:16] is little flowery messages.
[1:10:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:10:20] &gt;&gt; That tickle the flesh
[1:10:22] &gt;&gt; and don't stir the soul.
[1:10:25] We don't want our flesh tickled. We want
[1:10:28] our souls to be restored for it restore
[1:10:34] my soul
[1:10:39] on tbn.
[1:10:40] Maya
[1:10:42] man everything of that woman is demonic.
[1:10:46] &gt;&gt; Her hair is demonic.
[1:10:47] &gt;&gt; Her lipstick is demonic.
[1:10:50] &gt;&gt; Her trousers she wear is demonic. But
[1:10:53] the people flock there
[1:10:55] &gt;&gt; and let Edgar Orosco tell you turn
[1:10:57] tonight.
[1:10:59] &gt;&gt; If you dance with the devil,
[1:11:01] [Applause]
[1:11:03] &gt;&gt; listen,
[1:11:04] &gt;&gt; if you dance with the devil,
[1:11:08] &gt;&gt; then you just escorted yourself to hell.
[1:11:14] Hallelujah.
[1:11:16] &gt;&gt; If you go with those ministers and dance
[1:11:19] with them, then you just escorted
[1:11:22] yourself to hell.
[1:11:36] That's why this will never die.
[1:11:40] This is a message from the Lord. This is
[1:11:43] a man of God here.
[1:11:51] [Applause]
[1:12:02] Yeah.
[1:12:04] Yeah. Yeah. We dance with Jesus.
[1:12:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:12:24] You don't hear anybody preach on
[1:12:26] Revelations 10.
[1:12:30] &gt;&gt; So, you know what I done?
[1:12:33] &gt;&gt; I shut my ears
[1:12:36] a long time ago
[1:12:39] &gt;&gt; with what all the critic says about me.
[1:12:44] Amen.
[1:12:49] &gt;&gt; And I watch my fruit of my ministry.
[1:12:53] &gt;&gt; I make my calling and election sure.
[1:13:03] &gt;&gt; So you close your ears
[1:13:06] &gt;&gt; to the clinics
[1:13:08] &gt;&gt; that says you look like a Omar
[1:13:11] &gt;&gt; with your long dress.
[1:13:13] We don't listen to clinics anymore. We
[1:13:16] pass.
[1:13:33] &gt;&gt; I don't listen to critics anymore.
[1:13:36] &gt;&gt; I'm like the weather.
[1:13:38] &gt;&gt; I'm like the weather.
[1:13:41] Unlike the weather,
[1:13:43] &gt;&gt; the weather don't take no nonsense
[1:13:46] &gt;&gt; and notice
[1:13:48] &gt;&gt; from the critics.
[1:13:51] &gt;&gt; If it rains
[1:13:53] &gt;&gt; and the critic says it's too wet, then
[1:13:56] it rains on.
[1:13:58] &gt;&gt; It doesn't listen to the critics.
[1:14:01] If it's hot
[1:14:04] and you say it's too hot and then the
[1:14:06] sun starts burning you, it goes on
[1:14:09] shining. It doesn't listen to clinics
[1:14:21] &gt;&gt; when it snows
[1:14:23] &gt;&gt; and it's cold.
[1:14:56] our ears.
[1:14:58] And now we got one of the best churches
[1:15:03] in the message because we close our
[1:15:06] ears.
[1:15:22] [Applause]
[1:15:22] [Music]
[1:15:25] And today they even lie in the pulpit.
[1:15:29] &gt;&gt; You hear them saying, "Can you feel the
[1:15:32] anointing?
[1:15:34] &gt;&gt; Then there is no anointing.
[1:15:38] &gt;&gt; It's a lie.
[1:15:43] They had thousands and thousands of
[1:15:45] people
[1:15:48] &gt;&gt; right up here with that big church.
[1:15:50] &gt;&gt; They even had to close the road and they
[1:15:53] were pulling for money all the time.
[1:15:59] &gt;&gt; And just 20 minutes preaching.
[1:16:04] &gt;&gt; And after they preached, the pastor came
[1:16:07] up. Can you feel the anointing?
[1:16:10] Yeah, you only anointed their pockets to
[1:16:14] get their money,
[1:16:16] &gt;&gt; but the anointing of God wasn't there.
[1:16:24] &gt;&gt; We don't preach money here. We preach
[1:16:27] the word of Almighty God.
[1:16:42] [Music]
[1:16:46] You don't have to say, "Can you feel the
[1:16:49] Holy Ghost? Can you feel the anointing?"
[1:16:53] &gt;&gt; That's not Bible.
[1:16:55] &gt;&gt; This is what happens
[1:16:58] &gt;&gt; when the anointing is there.
[1:17:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:17:05] [Applause]
[1:17:15] Close your eyes and say, "Lord, seal me.
[1:17:19] Lord, feel me. This is your night.
[1:17:24] This is the light
[1:17:28] for you to feel the anointing.
[1:17:37] [Applause]
[1:17:39] [Music]
[1:17:45] Oh,
[1:17:46] wait.
[1:17:47] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:17:50] Yes. Yes.
[1:18:07] [Applause]
[1:18:08] You can be baptized with the Holy Ghost.
[1:18:11] You can be sealed away. Hallelujah. You
[1:18:13] can grab a hold of the altar tonight.
[1:18:16] Praise God. Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:18:18] [Music]
[1:18:20] Forever
[1:18:23] I
[1:18:24] visitation of the angel in South Africa.
[1:18:29] Here he is.
[1:18:32] Yay. Brother Brandham did not have to
[1:18:36] come back. The angel has come back.
[1:18:39] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:18:43] Thank you Jesus. Thank you Jesus. Glory.
[1:18:48] Glory. Glory. Glory. Glory.
[1:18:51] Glory. Glory. Glory. Glory. Thank you
[1:18:54] Jesus. Hallelujah. Thank you Lord. Thank
[1:18:58] you Lord. Thank you Lord.
[1:19:13] [Applause]
[1:19:23] &gt;&gt; The angel is here now. Close your eyes
[1:19:27] and say, "Lord, seal me. Lord, fill me."
[1:19:31] This is your night.
[1:19:37] [Music]
[1:19:41] Amen.
[1:19:43] So, nobody can tell you, "Can you feel
[1:19:45] the Holy Ghost?" If you don't see this
[1:19:47] there, then he's lying in the pulpit.
[1:19:50] He's lying on a holy place. He's lying
[1:19:53] before God. If you don't see this, there
[1:19:56] is no Holy Ghost. There is no anointing.
[1:20:00] This is S. Amen.
[1:20:17] And
[1:20:19] and the Bible says in Acts chapter 2
[1:20:22] when they came from the upper room they
[1:20:25] couldn't sit still. They couldn't sit in
[1:20:28] their chairs like those people couldn't.
[1:20:30] That's what happened in the day of
[1:20:32] Pentecost.
[1:20:35] They got up and went into the street
[1:20:39] and they were drunk. Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:20:42] Where is that?
[1:20:45] [Applause]
[1:21:12] Hallelujah.
[1:21:24] &gt;&gt; Don't you feel like that tonight?
[1:21:41] Look at it here. Look at it. Look at it.
[1:21:46] A bunch of drunkies here tonight.
[1:22:15] You don't have to tell them.
[1:22:19] Can you feel the anointing is you know
[1:22:22] that's not Bible
[1:22:24] Bible is in 2 Chronicles
[1:22:27] chapter 7 verse two
[1:22:31] readise
[1:22:37] [Applause]
[1:22:59] When the glory comes, the preacher
[1:23:02] cannot preach. When the anointing comes,
[1:23:06] you don't have to say it here. It comes.
[1:23:08] Uh it don't come from a church.
[1:23:11] It don't come from an organization.
[1:23:13] It comes from heaven
[1:23:16] and it calls the church.
[1:23:20] The fire of God.
[1:23:22] You don't have to say it. You can feel
[1:23:25] the fire. You can feel the heat. Can you
[1:23:30] feel it tonight?
[1:24:02] There you go.
[1:24:06] Neahhemiah
[1:24:09] &gt;&gt; Neahhemiah
[1:24:11] chapter 8 and nine
[1:24:14] 8 five and six
[1:24:17] &gt;&gt; read
[1:24:29] &gt;&gt; Hold it.
[1:24:31] &gt;&gt; When he read the word, what did the
[1:24:32] people do?
[1:24:34] What does Elan do when the Bible gets
[1:24:37] read?
[1:24:47] &gt;&gt; I would rather stand up in respect to
[1:24:51] the Bible
[1:24:52] &gt;&gt; than to stand up.
[1:25:04] with the anthem of South Africa.
[1:25:19] &gt;&gt; When the word gets read, we stand up in
[1:25:22] honor.
[1:25:28] and lead on.
[1:25:37] Amen.
[1:25:39] &gt;&gt; Why do you say amen? Is because it's in
[1:25:42] the Bible.
[1:25:44] &gt;&gt; When they finished read the word and
[1:25:46] they heard the word and the word of God
[1:25:48] was preached, the people got up and
[1:25:51] said, "Amen."
[1:25:53] Amen.
[1:25:55] Amen.
[1:25:57] Amen.
[1:26:14] [Applause]
[1:26:39] Hallelujah.
[1:26:43] Thank you.
[1:26:45] Could
[1:26:54] we read on?
[1:27:01] &gt;&gt; No. What? Worth lifting.
[1:27:03] [Applause]
[1:27:07] &gt;&gt; Where do you see that?
[1:27:08] &gt;&gt; I see it in E Tabernacle. I don't see it
[1:27:12] in TBNN,
[1:27:14] but I see it in Eel Tabernacle. People
[1:27:17] get up, shout, "Amen." Amen. Raise up
[1:27:21] their hands.
[1:27:27] You are in the Bible. You are in the
[1:27:30] Bible. You are in the Bible. Full
[1:27:33] obedience to the word.
[1:27:54] And they worship God.
[1:27:59] &gt;&gt; And nobody told them to do it.
[1:28:02] &gt;&gt; They done it automatically.
[1:28:05] &gt;&gt; I never told you to do it.
[1:28:12] Then why are you doing it?
[1:28:16] &gt;&gt; There's a supernatural being in you.
[1:28:20] I said, "Come on, put up your hands.
[1:28:23] Come on, dance.
[1:28:32] Hallelujah.

[1:33:46] All right.
[1:34:08] Yes,
[1:34:10] you don't have to tell the people.
[1:34:14] It's automatic.
[1:34:17] A super. When you ask the people to say
[1:34:20] amen. When you tell the people man can
[1:34:23] you feel the means that they don't have
[1:34:25] the supernatural being in them.
[1:34:27] &gt;&gt; That's why you have to ask them. But if
[1:34:30] they have the supernatural being in
[1:34:32] them,

[1:35:31] I know the service is over.
[1:35:35] I want to push on a little.
[1:35:41] Brother Paul,
[1:35:43] if you have to beg the people to say
[1:35:44] amen
[1:35:47] and you tell the people say amen.
[1:35:51] And if there's anyone that don't amen,
[1:35:55] then he just lost the opportunity to
[1:35:59] gladden God's heart.
[1:36:03] When you don't say amen, you don't
[1:36:05] gladden God's heart. Why
[1:36:09] he writes says amen, brother Brennham.
[1:36:14] And said, thus saith the Lord.
[1:36:17] Thus saith the Lord. It gladden God's
[1:36:21] heart.
[1:36:23] And you say amen tonight.
[1:36:27] It gladden God's heart.
[1:36:30] Oh, hallelujah.
[1:36:37] The fire is going
[1:36:54] Heat. Heat.
[1:37:43] Let me settle. Lord,
[1:37:47] this is too much.

[1:38:25] his art. Go on.

[1:40:11] It's automatic.
[1:40:14] Just something inside said clap your
[1:40:16] hands man. Just inside in you say dance
[1:40:20] man.
[1:40:22] Inside of you said cladding my heart
[1:40:26] with a amen.
[1:40:27] [Applause]
