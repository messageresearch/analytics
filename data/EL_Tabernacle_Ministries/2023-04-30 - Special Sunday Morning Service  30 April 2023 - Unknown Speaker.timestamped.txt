[1:32:35] [Applause]
[1:32:50] we came from bloemfontein and meeting
[1:32:52] them on Wednesday
[1:32:57] came down again to have this meeting and
[1:33:00] just greet you people
[1:33:05] [Applause]
[1:33:14] [Applause]
[1:33:18] are going up to George from

[1:33:25] I'm not gonna rush back home
[1:33:28] for the meeting next week
[1:33:32] [Applause]
[1:33:47] I have a busy schedule
[1:33:51] I like to be busy anyhow
[1:33:55] and try to look for that last soul
[1:34:03] [Applause]
[1:34:17] and I hope you are also looking for him
[1:34:22] [Applause]
[1:34:33] it could even be your friend that you
[1:34:36] walk with maybe every day to work
[1:34:41] it could even be
[1:34:44] a colic at work
[1:34:46] could be the neighbor
[1:34:51] it says you look for them
[1:34:53] [Applause]
[1:35:02] what else
[1:35:03] [Applause]
[1:35:08] let us look
[1:35:11] to make the time shorter now I don't
[1:35:14] know
[1:35:15] I still have
[1:35:18] a question mark with a
[1:35:20] you still got to be saved
[1:35:23] or whether he's gonna get the baptism of
[1:35:27] the Holy Ghost to be in
[1:35:29] because the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:35:31] put you in the church
[1:35:37] and when you come in from outside you
[1:35:40] only get converted
[1:35:42] so
[1:35:44] either way
[1:35:49] we sick and tired of this old world
[1:36:00] [Applause]
[1:36:08] song
[1:36:11] that's why we
[1:36:14] have been preaching in 40 countries
[1:36:19] and we
[1:36:21] didn't ask any of that 40 countries
[1:36:25] if we can come and visit them they send
[1:36:27] me invitation
[1:36:29] I don't go out to any country
[1:36:33] [Applause]
[1:36:35] unless
[1:36:37] they give me invitation
[1:36:39] [Applause]
[1:36:44] so I know there's some brethren as they
[1:36:46] travel they write and they ask
[1:36:51] if they could come and preach to their
[1:36:53] congregations around the world
[1:36:56] but I haven't asked any ever
[1:37:00] if I could come and visit their Church
[1:37:04] I
[1:37:06] was given invitations
[1:37:09] to the 40 countries
[1:37:13] and
[1:37:16] that's not the only countries that I
[1:37:19] visited
[1:37:21] I visited
[1:37:22] Taiwan Greece
[1:37:28] China
[1:37:30] of Africa with Zambia malao in Swaziland
[1:37:38] I visited
[1:37:42] Rome Italy Portugal
[1:37:46] and Malaysia and Singapore
[1:37:51] Argentina Wales
[1:37:54] Egypt Jordan
[1:38:03] and on and on and on it goes
[1:38:06] [Applause]
[1:38:15] [Applause]
[1:38:21] and right now it's been streamed
[1:38:26] right across South Africa
[1:38:32] this Gathering yeah
[1:38:36] [Applause]
[1:38:37] [Music]
[1:38:47] [Applause]
[1:38:59] and by tomorrow
[1:39:02] it will be worldwide
[1:39:07] we
[1:39:10] do not
[1:39:12] ask them
[1:39:14] to come onto our stream
[1:39:18] but people knows where they can get
[1:39:22] something
[1:39:23] [Applause]
[1:39:32] [Applause]
[1:39:35] and so there's a lot of people a lot of
[1:39:38] ministers at streams
[1:39:41] but the people know they're not going to
[1:39:42] get anything
[1:39:44] so they don't listen to them
[1:39:48] they get sick so eight to ten or 20
[1:39:53] people listening to their messages
[1:39:57] because there's no meat on the bone
[1:40:02] [Applause]
[1:40:21] and people you cannot fool them all the
[1:40:24] time
[1:40:41] [Applause]
[1:40:48] they're going to find out
[1:40:51] you look at animal life
[1:40:54] you'll find animals only there where
[1:40:59] they can get food
[1:41:01] the minute they don't get food they
[1:41:03] travel to another place
[1:41:09] [Applause]
[1:41:18] they might
[1:41:20] they might not like the place
[1:41:24] but because of the food that's there
[1:41:42] they might not
[1:41:45] like El Tabernacle
[1:41:49] but they like the food that's in our
[1:41:54] government
[1:42:05] so therefore
[1:42:09] we
[1:42:12] put
[1:42:14] the food on the table before them
[1:42:27] and you find them eating
[1:42:30] [Applause]
[1:42:36] another Pastor told me the other some
[1:42:39] time ago told me
[1:42:41] Brothers go all the two
[1:42:43] don't have to do
[1:42:46] please don't stop preaching because
[1:42:50] we're going to die
[1:42:54] [Applause]
[1:43:08] so
[1:43:10] foreign
[1:43:15] something you sound
[1:43:18] and it's selling
[1:43:21] Maybe
[1:43:23] you sound
[1:43:25] some things that the people want
[1:43:30] and they buy it
[1:43:33] why must you go and sell something that
[1:43:36] the people that don't want and leave the
[1:43:40] thing that you are selling that is
[1:43:43] actually bringing in something
[1:43:47] you'd rather leave the other thing
[1:43:49] and you go on to the thing that works
[1:43:52] [Applause]
[1:43:57] [Applause]
[1:44:02] so
[1:44:06] we are not gonna give this up for
[1:44:08] anything
[1:44:18] amen so may God bless you
[1:44:21] and uh
[1:44:23] you pray for me I pray for you
[1:44:28] [Applause]
[1:44:34] and remember
[1:44:38] we didn't come to church today
[1:44:45] we come here today
[1:44:48] to speak to something
[1:44:50] that will speak back to us
[1:44:54] [Applause]
[1:45:05] yeah
[1:45:06] [Applause]
[1:45:07] you're not going out here
[1:45:12] with an
[1:45:14] unanswered question
[1:45:30] May
[1:45:32] all your questions
[1:45:37] the answer
[1:45:41] is my prayer
[1:45:46] [Applause]
[1:45:49] so I think you know already what I'm
[1:45:52] gonna preach on
[1:45:55] because I streamed it
[1:46:00] and I am going to preach on it
[1:46:08] because I
[1:46:10] am the elders
[1:46:14] member in the message now in South
[1:46:16] Africa or in Africa
[1:46:19] in the whole of Africa
[1:46:37] and uh
[1:46:40] I am the only one that brother Branham
[1:46:43] laid the hands on
[1:46:46] [Applause]
[1:46:57] so
[1:47:00] so I should know what I'm talking about
[1:47:11] I
[1:47:13] I didn't come here
[1:47:16] to waste your time and waste my time
[1:47:21] because there is no time
[1:47:23] [Applause]
[1:47:25] [Music]
[1:47:30] [Applause]
[1:47:32] we have to make sure
[1:47:35] that everything is in place
[1:47:40] for us to make it to the gate
[1:47:44] positively
[1:47:50] and I don't want to miss it amen
[1:47:54] therefore let's go to the word of God
[1:47:58] and let us put down what God wants us to
[1:48:03] have
[1:48:03] for this day
[1:48:06] because he says give us this day
[1:48:11] Our Daily Bread
[1:48:15] so may he help us to give you
[1:48:19] this day
[1:48:21] your daily bread
[1:48:27] I like to take two scriptures in
[1:48:29] Ecclesiastes
[1:48:31] three one three eight
[1:48:35] First Corinthians 3 6.
[1:48:38] and Zechariah 4 6.
[1:48:47] turning to Ecclesiastes chapter 3.
[1:48:51] verse 1.
[1:48:54] and then Ecclesiastes three
[1:49:02] verse 8.
[1:49:05] to everything
[1:49:09] there is a season
[1:49:13] and a Time
[1:49:19] to every
[1:49:22] purpose
[1:49:25] under the heaven
[1:49:29] everything
[1:49:33] has
[1:49:35] a Time
[1:49:38] and has
[1:49:42] a season
[1:49:46] for every purpose that God sinned on the
[1:49:51] Earth
[1:49:54] therefore it's essential to know
[1:49:58] what time
[1:50:02] you are living in
[1:50:10] and what season
[1:50:14] you are experiencing
[1:50:17] in the message of the hour
[1:50:22] we cannot just go on and says I am in
[1:50:26] the message
[1:50:27] and you do not know your time
[1:50:31] in the message
[1:50:33] and your season
[1:50:36] in the message
[1:50:41] because everything
[1:50:43] has a Time
[1:50:45] and a season
[1:50:52] then verse 8 it says
[1:50:56] A Time To Love
[1:51:01] and as I said
[1:51:04] when we spoke on George Martin's thing
[1:51:07] brother George Martin Pastor George
[1:51:10] Martin sing
[1:51:13] I said you can't love
[1:51:16] all the time
[1:51:21] and that made me sick in this message
[1:51:25] wherever you go
[1:51:29] you hear love love love
[1:51:34] nice humble love
[1:51:38] and it's wrong
[1:51:43] because there's only a Time
[1:51:47] and a season
[1:51:50] too long
[1:52:02] I want to come back there
[1:52:05] then it says
[1:52:07] A Time To Love
[1:52:10] and a time to
[1:52:14] you can't hate all the time
[1:52:26] you become
[1:52:29] an outlaw when you hate all the time
[1:52:34] but now you can't
[1:52:38] hate in the time of love
[1:52:42] That season you need to love
[1:52:47] and then you can't Love in the Time of
[1:52:50] hate and judgment
[1:52:55] Sodom
[1:52:58] couldn't
[1:53:00] get love
[1:53:04] because it was a time of judgment
[1:53:11] you must have your balance
[1:53:24] I'd like to take another scripture
[1:53:30] um
[1:53:32] as I said Corinthians
[1:53:36] 3 verse 6.
[1:53:46] 13 6 I'm sorry
[1:53:49] 13 6.
[1:53:59] it says that love
[1:54:02] rejoices not in iniquity
[1:54:07] love rejoice in the truth
[1:54:16] now how could you say you have love
[1:54:20] and there's no rejoicing in your church
[1:54:23] then you're a liar
[1:54:26] because love
[1:54:29] rejoice
[1:54:32] you can't have rejoicing Without Love
[1:54:38] then why isn't there
[1:54:41] rejoicing
[1:54:43] in the church
[1:54:46] because
[1:54:48] automatically
[1:54:51] there's no love
[1:55:01] then why is there such a lot of
[1:55:04] rejoicing in El Tabernacle
[1:55:14] now I'm asking you
[1:55:17] [Applause]
[1:55:28] because we put a thing the way God wants
[1:55:33] it
[1:55:43] have you got it
[1:55:45] did I speak to somebody
[1:55:49] right over the air in South Africa where
[1:55:51] they're listening to me have you got it
[1:55:54] Johannesburg all those places
[1:56:01] so no rejoicing No Love
[1:56:06] and then made it worse
[1:56:11] rejoice in the truth the truth is the
[1:56:13] word
[1:56:15] so they don't have the true word
[1:56:18] in its season and in its time
[1:56:21] [Applause]
[1:56:37] another scripture
[1:56:41] foreign
[1:56:51] chapter 4 verse 6.
[1:56:56] then it answered and spoke unto me
[1:57:01] saying
[1:57:03] this is the word of the Lord
[1:57:06] unto Jehovah Bell
[1:57:13] I like to put brother branham's name in
[1:57:15] there
[1:57:24] saying to
[1:57:26] brother Brennan
[1:57:29] it's not by might
[1:57:32] nor by power
[1:57:37] but
[1:57:42] [Music]
[1:57:57] father we thank you for the reading of
[1:57:59] your word
[1:58:01] you said that your word won't turn unto
[1:58:03] your Void but it will accomplish what it
[1:58:05] should
[1:58:07] and I'll pray that you would
[1:58:11] open it up
[1:58:13] punctuated
[1:58:16] anointed
[1:58:21] throw water on it
[1:58:24] Let It Grow
[1:58:27] and never stop growing Lord
[1:58:30] as we add add the seven birth pings of
[1:58:34] Malachi 4.
[1:58:38] I hand a meeting into your hands
[1:58:41] in Jesus name amen
[1:58:44] you may be suitable
[1:58:54] um
[1:59:16] uh time to love
[1:59:19] A Time To Love
[1:59:22] there's only a space of time to love
[1:59:28] and there's a time space to hate
[1:59:33] that's why brother Branham says we must
[1:59:35] be like Jesus Christ
[1:59:38] we mustn't get too soft
[1:59:42] that we don't clean out the church
[1:59:46] he says Jesus Christ went into the
[1:59:48] church
[1:59:50] with a whoop
[1:59:53] and he says he cleaned the church out
[1:59:55] [Music]
[1:59:58] now that was not the time to laugh
[2:00:02] that was not the time to be nice my
[2:00:05] brother
[2:00:06] that was not the time to be meek my
[2:00:08] brother
[2:00:09] that was not the time that we think that
[2:00:12] love had to cover the multitude of the
[2:00:15] Sun in the church
[2:00:17] that was a time of height
[2:00:19] because the prophet says he looked at
[2:00:22] them
[2:00:25] with hatred
[2:00:27] malice
[2:00:29] he was crossed when he looked at him
[2:00:33] and brother when it says where's your
[2:00:34] virtues now
[2:00:38] if you don't hear the balance you would
[2:00:41] says now how could this be love
[2:00:43] that was perfect Lord
[2:00:48] [Applause]
[2:01:01] that was perfect love when he cleaned
[2:01:03] out the church
[2:01:09] and hit on the cross
[2:01:13] when there was a sin on his right left
[2:01:15] hand side
[2:01:17] and guys gambling here at the foot of
[2:01:19] his is his his cross
[2:01:22] he looked down on them
[2:01:26] and he says I forgive you
[2:01:28] A Time To Love
[2:01:32] [Applause]
[2:01:52] so there's a Time To Love
[2:01:55] and there's a time to hate
[2:01:58] the Bible says
[2:02:01] he loves The Sinner
[2:02:04] that's why he says they know not what
[2:02:06] they do
[2:02:11] it was a time that it showed love
[2:02:16] but in the temple there was no time for
[2:02:19] love
[2:02:20] Sodom and Gomorrah there was no time to
[2:02:23] lie
[2:02:26] so
[2:02:27] so
[2:02:29] he says I hated Esau
[2:02:33] there was no time to allow
[2:02:40] [Applause]
[2:02:53] so
[2:02:55] I came to the conclusion
[2:02:59] What is love
[2:03:03] everybody speaks about love
[2:03:07] wherever you go love
[2:03:11] they think that when you rebuke people
[2:03:14] you don't have love
[2:03:18] when you tell them where they are wrong
[2:03:20] they say you have no love
[2:03:25] [Applause]
[2:03:30] and then the one that compromises with a
[2:03:33] guy that is wrong that guy's got love
[2:03:37] it's got love you know no he's got
[2:03:40] compromise
[2:03:42] he's compromising
[2:03:48] [Applause]
[2:03:50] give me the man that come up and said
[2:03:52] brother Roscoe you're wrong
[2:03:57] then I show you a man that loves me
[2:04:00] and he shows me in the Bible
[2:04:03] and he shows me in the spoken word
[2:04:06] then I would say yes that's a lot
[2:04:11] [Applause]
[2:04:19] when
[2:04:21] you straighten out somebody
[2:04:23] then they say Mr No Love
[2:04:27] and yet that's love
[2:04:37] so what is love
[2:04:45] What is love
[2:04:48] is allowed to compromise with your
[2:04:49] brother
[2:04:52] if he can't dance and he doesn't want to
[2:04:56] dance and he'll reject to dance and the
[2:04:59] Bible says You must dance and you tell
[2:05:01] him the Bible says so and he doesn't
[2:05:04] want to listen you are the one that has
[2:05:07] love but he hasn't got it
[2:05:11] because God's love is correct
[2:05:18] [Applause]
[2:05:26] that's why an El Tabernacle when you're
[2:05:29] wrong you're wrong
[2:05:30] [Music]
[2:05:35] [Applause]
[2:05:46] What is love
[2:05:49] I sat in a church
[2:05:52] in Kimberly in another
[2:05:55] guy got up and say yeah
[2:06:00] you must love
[2:06:01] and I knew it was for me
[2:06:06] and I look at him I look at this young
[2:06:07] man
[2:06:08] and I said this young man don't even
[2:06:10] know what love is
[2:06:13] but they speak about love
[2:06:15] What is love
[2:06:19] do they know what is love
[2:06:23] now what a queer
[2:06:27] title and subject this is
[2:06:30] What is love
[2:06:34] and I got it straight from Brother
[2:06:36] Brennan
[2:06:39] brother Brandon rejected King I think
[2:06:41] 1916.
[2:06:44] I think that's after he preach all the
[2:06:46] love messages
[2:06:48] and then after that he preached on the
[2:06:52] rejected King
[2:06:56] and the angel of the Lord came to him
[2:07:00] and he thought this is my chance
[2:07:03] this is my opportunity
[2:07:06] this is my time
[2:07:08] This Is My Season
[2:07:11] to ask the angel of the Lord

[2:21:19] why
[2:21:21] love hanging on a chain around their
[2:21:25] necks is in love
[2:21:28] but a perverted love
[2:21:30] and they feel religious
[2:21:33] would love hanging around the Nets on a
[2:21:37] chain
[2:21:38] love
[2:21:40] as a sticker on the bumper of a car
[2:21:44] is in love but perverted cloth
[2:21:47] and they feel secure because they've got
[2:21:51] love on the bumper of a car that nobody

[2:22:31] and they feel they secure
[2:22:34] and they feel they're religious
[2:22:37] love displayed on a billboard of a
[2:22:40] building
[2:22:41] that's not love
[2:22:43] and they feel that they have salvation
[2:22:47] because love the word love is there
[2:22:52] I like brother Layman used to say he
[2:22:55] says don't come and tell me about love
[2:22:56] he says he's a loved one
[2:23:11] love on the postcard and a letter wrote

[2:24:50] why must I settle for less
[2:24:53] when God gave me the Revelation like
[2:24:55] another Prophet told me he says you took
[2:24:58] the best
[2:24:59] out of the message I said what's that he
[2:25:02] says the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[2:25:07] I took the best
[2:25:09] and I've got the best
[2:25:12] because the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[2:25:15] as ours
[2:25:18] [Applause]
[2:25:29] foreign
[2:25:31] [Applause]
[2:25:39] the baptism of the Holy Ghost is even
[2:25:41] the blood
[2:25:43] because the token is the Holy Ghost
[2:25:48] even the blog
[2:25:50] the blood that cleans you that's even
[2:25:52] the Holy Ghost
[2:25:53] that's even the baptism of the Holy
[2:25:55] Ghost
[2:26:00] and the Holy Ghost baptism is greater
[2:26:04] than the word brother Brennan said
[2:26:08] [Applause]
[2:26:09] [Music]
[2:26:12] so the baptism of the Holy Ghost sees
[2:26:15] everything

[2:27:55] but I have no power to love
[2:27:59] they love power
[2:28:01] but they don't have power to love why
[2:28:04] because you can only get power after the
[2:28:08] Holy Ghost has come upon you then you
[2:28:11] have power to love Hallelujah
[2:28:15] blessed be my conscious man can preach
[2:28:18] man Hallelujah

[2:29:09] they speak about love but they don't
[2:29:11] have power to enforce law they don't
[2:29:15] have power to send my brother I forgive
[2:29:17] you
[2:29:21] but El Tabernacle the power is here for
[2:29:25] you to love your brother to love your
[2:29:27] sister to love your enemy power
[2:29:32] [Applause]
[2:29:40] [Music]
[2:29:41] [Applause]
[2:29:43] [Music]
[2:29:45] [Applause]
[2:29:58] [Applause]
[2:30:17] oh my
[2:30:20] they all speak about the blood
[2:30:24] [Music]
[2:30:27] but they never broke the blood
[2:30:30] but ultimate broke the blood vessel
[2:30:34] what came out of that
[2:30:38] what came out of that
[2:30:41] I want to hear from you what did come
[2:30:43] out of the blood vessel
[2:30:49] so that means you're under the blood
[2:30:51] [Applause]
[2:31:01] [Music]
[2:31:08] oh my God
[2:31:12] Jonathan
[2:31:13] in the Bible
[2:31:16] his father
[2:31:18] wanted him
[2:31:20] to portray David
[2:31:23] Jonathan
[2:31:24] in the Bible
[2:31:26] was actually hated by his father
[2:31:30] because of what
[2:31:32] because of the love he had
[2:31:36] for David
[2:31:39] [Applause]
[2:31:41] and you know what
[2:31:43] the Bible says the love between the two
[2:31:46] of them
[2:31:47] was greater than the love of a woman
[2:31:51] it was greater than polio love
[2:31:55] so what love was between Jonathan
[2:31:58] and David
[2:32:01] if it was greater
[2:32:03] [Music]
[2:32:04] [Applause]
[2:32:06] then what is the love in El Tabernacle
[2:32:10] [Music]
[2:32:19] a holy ghost love
[2:32:22] the real alarm
[2:32:25] [Applause]
[2:32:26] [Music]
[2:32:29] the baptism of the Holy Ghost alive
[2:32:32] [Applause]
[2:32:34] now listen to this preaching my God this
[2:32:37] guy can preach man listen to this
[2:32:40] preaching Amen brother Brahm says the
[2:32:43] guide which is the baptism of the Holy
[2:32:45] Ghost
[2:32:46] takes the Believer by the hand in a
[2:32:48] guide
[2:32:49] and he leads him into faith and virtue
[2:32:52] and knowledge and Temperance and
[2:32:55] patience and godliness he leads you
[2:32:59] into his own virtues
[2:33:02] he leads you into his own fruit amen the
[2:33:07] Holy Ghost
[2:33:08] [Applause]
[2:33:08] [Music]
[2:33:13] [Applause]

[2:33:26] and what I like and what I love after he
[2:33:31] led you right up then he says he lead
[2:33:34] you into the Holy Ghost
[2:33:37] then brother man put the Holy Ghost
[2:33:39] there
[2:33:40] and the next step is love
[2:33:43] and Galatians is the the fruit of the
[2:33:46] Holy Ghost is
[2:33:47] so the Holy Ghost gives you the Capstone
[2:33:58] that was for somebody somewhere
[2:34:02] [Music]
[2:34:07] [Applause]
[2:34:16] [Applause]
[2:34:26] [Applause]
[2:34:33] there is only one love
[2:34:38] and that's a couple of
[2:34:40] all the other loves
[2:34:43] is a perversion
[2:34:44] it gets weaker and weaker
[2:34:47] everything that's not the Holy Ghost
[2:34:50] is not perfect
[2:34:54] because when that which is perfect
[2:34:57] has come
[2:34:59] that's which is in part
[2:35:02] will be done away with
[2:35:04] because the quickening power
[2:35:07] the Holy Ghost
[2:35:09] will change this Mortal body
[2:35:13] [Music]
[2:35:16] keeping the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[2:35:19] [Music]
[2:35:24] [Applause]
[2:35:27] let me just eat this quickly
[2:35:30] a couple of
[2:35:32] his first John 4 16. God is a love
[2:35:37] and God is a spirit
[2:35:40] so the spirit has the fruits
[2:35:43] and all the fruits have the spirit
[2:35:47] fully Your Love
[2:35:49] is love for a woman Ephesians 5 28. its
[2:35:54] husbands love your wives
[2:35:57] a weaker love now it's not love God is
[2:35:59] love your wife it's a weaker love
[2:36:19] the third one as it comes down the
[2:36:21] ladder
[2:36:23] Heroes of love
[2:36:25] Evil's love is a sexual love
[2:36:29] goes into sex Hebrew 13 4 the bed is
[2:36:34] undefiled
[2:36:36] a week of love
[2:36:40] then it gets weaker it goes to
[2:36:44] stoic love stoic love
[2:36:48] is love for another man's wife
[2:36:51] Exodus 20. Thou shalt not come until
[2:36:54] thou tree
[2:37:00] [Applause]
[2:37:10] then it gets weaker it goes into free
[2:37:14] love free love free love
[2:37:18] amen Genesis 6 they took them to
[2:37:21] themselves wives they didn't marry them
[2:37:28] free love
[2:37:39] then it gets weaker it gets into lust
[2:37:42] full love
[2:37:44] Matthew 5 28 who sayever look upon a
[2:37:48] woman and lust after her has commanded
[2:37:50] adultery with her already lustful love
[2:37:56] [Applause]
[2:38:04] listen I can't help for what God gave me
[2:38:07] I can't help for what a preacher I am I
[2:38:10] can't help from a gift God gave me I
[2:38:13] came from the conference of God and I
[2:38:15] don't read the spoken word like all the
[2:38:18] other ministers God leads me different
[2:38:22] [Applause]
[2:38:25] [Music]
[2:38:34] then it comes to the loss Brother Bruno
[2:38:36] says then he comes to the last ungodly
[2:38:39] love
[2:38:40] which is Romans 1 24
[2:38:42] homosexual love
[2:38:44] Solomon Gomorrah
[2:38:47] then God comes into the flesh it's a
[2:38:50] homosexual love
[2:38:52] then he comes down himself to come and
[2:38:55] see if it is soul Amen in homosexual
[2:38:59] love when it hits homosexual love it
[2:39:02] leads the the color violet it comes into
[2:39:05] the color violet and God become a man
[2:39:09] [Applause]
[2:39:18] [Applause]
[2:39:29] when you get here it's so far away from
[2:39:33] a couple so far away from the spirit of
[2:39:36] God that it's not resembling God anymore
[2:39:40] but is resembling the Lucifer
[2:39:44] then it goes further amen into a a a a
[2:39:48] furtherance from the agape love it goes
[2:39:52] into incest
[2:39:54] father sleeping with their daughters
[2:39:58] it breaks down it becomes worse and
[2:40:02] worse and worse and worse
[2:40:05] are we there
[2:40:13] [Applause]
[2:40:16] then you have men
[2:40:18] sleeping with animals
[2:40:22] it's also love
[2:40:29] so what is love
[2:40:33] those six steps or seven steps is not
[2:40:36] love
[2:40:37] there's only one love
[2:40:39] and that's the Holy Ghost
[2:40:42] and you don't want it
[2:40:44] you message groups don't want it
[2:40:48] and he says that in rejected King
[2:40:51] when the angel told him that love is the
[2:40:54] Holy Ghost
[2:40:56] rejected King
[2:40:58] is the Holy Ghost rejected of course
[2:41:02] it was rejected in this message
[2:41:06] they didn't want to jump they didn't
[2:41:08] want to have that Pompa do mix up they
[2:41:11] didn't want to act like maniacs but I'm
[2:41:14] like Paul my father in the way that Paul
[2:41:18] Harris say I'll serve the god of my
[2:41:21] fathers if they don't like it I don't
[2:41:25] care I'm like David I will dance before
[2:41:29] the ark because love rejoices in the ark
[2:41:34] [Applause]
[2:41:35] come on
[2:41:43] [Applause]
[2:41:47] and I don't know how you feel hermanus
[2:41:51] if you feel like your pastor then you'll
[2:41:54] do what your pastor do if he
[2:41:57] dances you will dance
[2:42:00] [Applause]
[2:42:01] [Music]
[2:42:07] [Applause]
[2:42:14] [Applause]
[2:42:15] [Music]
[2:42:21] Love Comes weaker
[2:42:24] as it comes into almost sexuality
[2:42:28] and then God
[2:42:30] said Michael
[2:42:33] Gabriel
[2:42:34] step into this
[2:42:39] why Lord
[2:42:41] he says we're going to take a little
[2:42:42] stroll
[2:42:51] [Applause]
[2:42:56] where to Lord
[2:42:58] going down to the plains of memory
[2:43:01] who's in the plains of memory
[2:43:04] is a plain and simple guy
[2:43:07] by the name of Abraham
[2:43:09] [Music]
[2:43:22] [Applause]
[2:43:26] but I'm not going to visit Abraham I
[2:43:30] want to visit Sarah
[2:43:32] [Music]
[2:43:34] when God comes into the flesh he don't
[2:43:37] worry about the prophets
[2:43:40] he worries about his bride
[2:43:42] [Applause]
[2:43:43] [Music]
[2:43:46] and if God comes into a flesh now
[2:43:49] he don't care about anything else
[2:43:55] for great is a mystery of godliness
[2:43:58] God men are pasted in the flesh
[2:44:01] [Applause]
[2:44:06] [Music]
[2:44:08] [Applause]
[2:44:16] [Music]
[2:44:20] he says
[2:44:23] on the Holy Ghost take 1958.
[2:44:27] and they come all the way down from a
[2:44:29] couple
[2:44:30] to folio love
[2:44:32] and down to lustful love
[2:44:35] to the lowest than God himself became
[2:44:39] man
[2:44:41] when it comes to the lowest of love
[2:44:44] then God puts on flesh
[2:44:56] [Music]
[2:45:00] when man comes to their lowest
[2:45:03] and they reject love
[2:45:05] because the Bible says in Matthew 24 it
[2:45:11] says that
[2:45:13] this is what it says for the love the
[2:45:17] Holy Ghost of many shall wax cold when
[2:45:22] it comes to that step
[2:45:24] is the love works cold in the church
[2:45:27] what love the Holy Ghost
[2:45:29] it's the Holy Ghost accepted
[2:45:32] that's why he put the quote in the
[2:45:34] rejected King because a rejected King is
[2:45:37] the Holy Ghost
[2:45:40] [Music]
[2:45:55] he even takes it for the book
[2:45:57] the Hebrew book page 157 you can go and
[2:46:00] read it
[2:46:02] oh El Tabernacle
[2:46:05] we can't read the spoken word like thing
[2:46:11] we're really different
[2:46:14] because we duck people
[2:46:17] [Applause]
[2:46:19] and we're drinking strange Waters
[2:46:22] plus his strange Waters you hurt
[2:46:27] it's true
[2:46:30] never heard it before
[2:46:38] that makes El Tabernacle so unique
[2:46:42] and it makes the ministry unique
[2:46:45] and make people want to know more
[2:46:58] and you know the quote I gave it to you
[2:47:01] in the Sin of unbelief
[2:47:04] he says the word
[2:47:07] the Holy Ghost is a quick to give than
[2:47:08] the word
[2:47:10] amen it's great to lie because you wrote
[2:47:12] the word
[2:47:18] says
[2:47:20] brother I said the Holy Ghost said
[2:47:23] [Applause]
[2:47:24] [Music]
[2:47:29] that's what I'm preaching now amen came
[2:47:32] out of brother Branham but I say that
[2:47:34] the Holy Ghost gave it to me
[2:47:37] because everybody read it and they don't
[2:47:39] know anything about it and they never
[2:47:41] ever mention it and they never ever
[2:47:43] preach it and they never ever testify
[2:47:45] about it and they never ever wrote about
[2:47:47] it but there's one Oddball a man that
[2:47:51] has grabbed it and heard it and preach
[2:47:54] it and now it is
[2:47:57] revealed in the Tabernacle
[2:48:02] [Applause]
[2:48:14] [Applause]
[2:48:24] oh my
[2:48:28] love

[2:55:10] I just want to read it
[2:55:12] and I mention it to you but now let me
[2:55:15] read it verse 4 5 and 6.

[2:55:25] fruit of the spirit

[2:55:39] charity
[2:55:41] fruit of the spirit love
[2:55:45] Galatians 5
[2:55:48] and the fruit of the spirit is alive
[2:55:53] it goes deeper
[2:55:55] I'm coming to that
[2:55:58] then we can close
[2:56:00] vaunted not itself
[2:56:03] is not puffed up
[2:56:06] because it's got a joy unspeakable
[2:56:09] do not behave itself unseemingly
[2:56:14] you listen to me amen you shut up Bishop
[2:56:18] if you don't say the Holy Ghost is a
[2:56:21] love then you shut up
[2:56:23] [Applause]
[2:56:24] [Music]
[2:56:26] [Applause]
[2:56:26] [Music]
[2:56:29] the Lord
[2:56:31] the Bible
[2:56:33] [Applause]
[2:56:40] we could not own fruit of the spirit
[2:56:43] is not easy to provoke think of No Evil
[2:56:47] and verse 6 Rejoice not in iniquity but
[2:56:51] rejoice in the truth
[2:56:54] now watch
[2:56:57] Galatians at the same God that wrote
[2:57:00] this road Galatians
[2:57:02] and in Galatians he comes and he says
[2:57:04] Galatians 5 22 he says and the Fruit of
[2:57:09] the Spirit
[2:57:11] is love
[2:57:13] now you don't say
[2:57:16] love and the spirit
[2:57:19] is the same thing
[2:57:21] now he makes love the fruit
[2:57:30] [Applause]
[2:57:52] and he don't stop there he says now the
[2:57:55] truth of the spirit is love and not love
[2:57:58] is
[2:58:00] and now the Holy Ghost is the fruit of
[2:58:01] the spirit but the fruit of the spirit
[2:58:04] is love love is a fruit
[2:58:08] why is love a fruit
[2:58:11] because love wasn't there before the
[2:58:14] foundation of the world
[2:58:16] there was no hate there because Lucifer
[2:58:18] was not even created
[2:58:21] so there was no hate there
[2:58:23] so love wasn't there
[2:58:25] but the spirit was there
[2:58:28] [Applause]
[2:58:45] now Paul says my brother the fruit of
[2:58:49] the spirit is love
[2:58:51] and what does he do next
[2:58:53] he says love joy
[2:58:56] Out of Love Comes Joy
[2:58:58] now how could they have love and they
[2:59:00] don't have joy because Paul says out of
[2:59:03] the spirit comes love Out of Love Comes
[2:59:06] Joy
[2:59:10] [Applause]
[2:59:17] [Applause]
[2:59:20] oh my
[2:59:30] thank you
[2:59:33] [Applause]
[2:59:41] you can't love
[2:59:43] without the Holy Ghost
[2:59:46] because the Holy Ghost bath love
[2:59:53] that's why the Holy Ghost must lead you
[2:59:56] up the stairs
[2:59:58] in my guide he says that
[3:00:01] because what he's leading you into is
[3:00:05] his fruit
[3:00:06] it's Galatians 5 22.
[3:00:10] so they take the fruit as love the fruit
[3:00:13] is not love it's a fruit of love the
[3:00:17] Holy Ghost
[3:00:22] amen I'm going to close I think you're
[3:00:26] blown out
[3:00:28] the bulbs are going like this
[3:00:38] out of love come Joy
[3:00:45] so give Jesus king God
[3:00:48] a boasting shout here
[3:00:51] [Music]
[3:00:51] [Applause]
[3:01:35] [Applause]
[3:01:55] foreign
[3:01:58] [Applause]

[3:03:05] foreign
[3:03:06] [Music]
[3:03:20] [Applause]
[3:03:23] [Music]
[3:03:38] [Applause]
[3:03:53] just another five minutes
[3:03:57] this is the way you should read
[3:04:00] First Corinthians 13.
[3:04:04] this is the way you ought to read it
[3:04:08] though I speak with the tongue of men
[3:04:10] and angels
[3:04:12] and don't have the baptism of the Holy
[3:04:14] Spirit
[3:04:15] I'm a sounding grass
[3:04:18] and a tinkling symbol
[3:04:23] this is the way
[3:04:25] the proper way
[3:04:27] to read it
[3:04:29] and though I have the gift of Prophecy
[3:04:32] and I understand all the Seven Seals
[3:04:35] and understand serpent seed and I
[3:04:38] understand the Mysteries that William
[3:04:40] Branham brought though I know all those
[3:04:42] Mysteries but if I don't have the
[3:04:44] baptism of the Holy Ghost
[3:04:46] Paul says you are nothing
[3:04:54] though you're 40 years in the message
[3:04:57] amen and you don't have the baptism of
[3:05:00] the Holy Ghost you are nothing
[3:05:03] [Applause]
[3:05:10] [Applause]
[3:05:16] though you are a big preacher
[3:05:19] a Treasurer a trusting a deacon amen a
[3:05:25] member for 40 years Amen in the message
[3:05:28] though you quote the prophet like this
[3:05:31] without the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[3:05:34] you are nothing
[3:05:36] [Music]
[3:05:44] though you'll have faith to remove
[3:05:47] mountains
[3:05:48] seven Thunders and seven Thunders and
[3:05:52] seven Thunders and nobody ever got the
[3:05:54] faith of it
[3:05:56] why
[3:05:58] because without the baptism of the Holy
[3:06:00] Ghost nothing works
[3:06:10] go you bestowed your goods to feed the
[3:06:14] poor
[3:06:16] and you don't have the baptism of the
[3:06:18] Holy Ghost it profits you nothing
[3:06:21] being in an end time Church
[3:06:25] you miss it you won't be considered
[3:06:29] Moses was not considered when he didn't
[3:06:33] have it
[3:06:34] God wanted to kill him because he didn't
[3:06:37] give it to his son
[3:06:40] brother Branham was not considered
[3:06:42] that's what his wife and his child was
[3:06:45] taken
[3:06:46] and you pastors think you're gonna make
[3:06:48] it when the prophet was actually a man
[3:06:52] under judgment when he didn't take it
[3:06:55] you're not going to be considered
[3:07:02] [Applause]
[3:07:06] I'm closing
[3:07:09] my God I'm closing
[3:07:12] love poinsure
[3:07:15] to the Holy Ghost
[3:07:17] as I said Colossians 5 26 2 says the
[3:07:21] fruit of the spirit is love
[3:07:24] thy doesn't say death
[3:07:26] love is equal with the Holy Ghost it
[3:07:29] says that's but just the fruit
[3:07:32] the same writer
[3:07:35] and I Echo amen
[3:07:40] why
[3:07:43] now you think love is going to save you
[3:07:47] love don't save you
[3:07:50] it doesn't
[3:07:52] the Bible says by Grace I will say not
[3:07:56] by Allah
[3:08:07] oh my
[3:08:10] it's so much deeper
[3:08:15] it's so much deeper
[3:08:21] love
[3:08:23] is the Fruit of the Spirit
[3:08:28] it leads us so deep the holy spirit will
[3:08:31] give you love
[3:08:32] so if you don't have the baptism of the
[3:08:35] Holy Ghost
[3:08:36] your Void of perfect love
[3:08:39] you might have love
[3:08:41] but one of the other loves
[3:08:46] because Romans 5 5 says
[3:08:51] the love of God
[3:08:53] is abroad in your hearts by the
[3:08:57] Holy Ghost
[3:08:59] [Applause]
[3:09:04] love comes into your heart only by the
[3:09:08] Holy Ghost
[3:09:10] so what is the Holy Ghost lost
[3:09:13] so how are you going to get love if the
[3:09:15] Holy Ghost supposed to put it in your
[3:09:17] heart
[3:09:19] so El Tabernacle you're right there
[3:09:23] you're right there
[3:09:25] with a Bible and with what brother
[3:09:27] Branham says and with Apostle anointing
[3:09:31] it
[3:09:31] [Applause]
[3:09:31] [Music]
[3:09:34] [Applause]
[3:09:45] let me lay it down
[3:09:48] the prophet says in Israel and the
[3:09:50] church page 51.
[3:09:52] paragraph 122.
[3:09:55] he says the holy spirit is the love of
[3:09:57] God
[3:09:58] I can prove it by the Bible
[3:10:03] he's challenging them
[3:10:05] he knows they don't know it because he
[3:10:08] never knew it and the word comes to the
[3:10:10] prophet
[3:10:11] and a prophet gives you to the apostle
[3:10:14] and the Apostle makes it clear
[3:10:17] because man comes behind me
[3:10:39] I can prove it by the Bible
[3:10:42] and we proved it by the Bible too
[3:10:44] [Music]
[3:10:48] so what is love
[3:10:51] What is love
[3:10:54] joburg What is love
[3:10:56] Pretoria What is love
[3:10:59] hermanus What is love
[3:11:02] [Applause]
[3:11:08] [Applause]
[3:11:22] rejected King
[3:11:25] 1960 he preached this
[3:11:29] quality others he already preached now I
[3:11:32] always wondered you know I always
[3:11:35] wondered when I read eleventh
[3:11:36] commandment
[3:11:37] how come in 11 Commandments
[3:11:40] he rebukes Canada so bad
[3:11:44] very bad
[3:11:45] don't read it or put the tape on
[3:11:48] and I thought now this man is preaching
[3:11:50] on love
[3:11:52] how can he rebuke the people
[3:11:55] can't you just forgive them or just look
[3:11:57] over it
[3:11:59] no he rebuked them writing that book
[3:12:04] and I couldn't understand it
[3:12:06] and when God opened it to me he says no
[3:12:09] he was showing you to love
[3:12:11] because love
[3:12:14] is corrective
[3:12:19] agopo love is corrective
[3:12:31] and that's why he rebuked them
[3:12:33] because they had no joy
[3:12:35] they were stiff
[3:12:37] and stodgy and stale
[3:12:42] and dead
[3:12:45] conservative
[3:12:47] and the Holy Ghost says I'm preaching on
[3:12:49] love and you have no joy
[3:12:52] and if he built them
[3:12:55] made this
[3:12:57] message churches that's dead
[3:13:01] May the year the prophets rebuke them
[3:13:04] [Applause]
[3:13:14] I'm closing
[3:13:20] it's better
[3:13:22] to light a candle in the dark
[3:13:27] then to curse the darkness
[3:13:46] so what is love
[3:13:49] let us read rejected King
[3:13:51] 1916 515.
[3:13:55] if there be those here listen to him
[3:13:58] he's praying now
[3:14:00] if
[3:14:02] there be those here Lord
[3:14:06] who doesn't know you
[3:14:08] in that way of love
[3:14:11] they know the other way of love
[3:14:14] nicey nicey one
[3:14:16] the folio one
[3:14:18] the one that compromises so that
[3:14:20] everybody can like them
[3:14:22] they know that one but it's big clear
[3:14:25] about that one is the one we're
[3:14:29] preaching on now
[3:14:30] if there's anybody that don't know it
[3:14:33] that's a love
[3:14:47] now watching
[3:14:50] watching
[3:14:53] without that type of a love
[3:14:56] then he says what type of a love the new
[3:14:59] birth
[3:15:01] the being born again
[3:15:03] the Holy Ghost is love
[3:15:09] if there's anyone here that don't
[3:15:12] understand it Lord may you open their
[3:15:15] eyes that the Holy Ghost is love
[3:15:18] [Applause]
[3:15:21] open our eyes in El Tabernacle
[3:15:24] for the scripture and the Bible say the
[3:15:26] same thing and the Apostle anoint said
[3:15:31] I'm an anointing it

[3:16:16] and then he said shh
[3:16:19] you're making too much a noise
[3:16:22] he says it's a Kinko worm
[3:16:25] but an oddball
[3:16:27] from Johannesburg

[4:08:33] we have already heard from our pastor

[4:08:40] invited
[4:08:42] a Believers you are

[4:08:54] those who's going to remind you who's

[4:09:15] issue of forwarding the names
[4:09:18] to the trustees
[4:09:20] the trustees are very stressed about
[4:09:23] that
[4:09:24] because people forget to to forward
[4:09:28] their names in time
[4:09:30] because it if not if the names now are
[4:09:33] not uh forwarded in time to the trustees
[4:09:36] they struggle very much to to
[4:09:40] organize the transports according to the
[4:09:43] volume of the people and it's it's good
[4:09:45] for for for record purposes to get these
[4:09:49] names in time
[4:09:51] you see so we just would like to urge
[4:09:55] the Believers if you can remember we
[4:09:57] forward the names on Friday
[4:10:00] then we make it
