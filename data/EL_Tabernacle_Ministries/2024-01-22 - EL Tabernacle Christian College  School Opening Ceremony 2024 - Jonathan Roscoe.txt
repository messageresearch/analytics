welcome [Applause] [Music] the only time you should ever look back is to see how far you've come looking back we see things clearly and what formerly appeared to be challenges now appear to be blessings greetings one and all in the name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ I would like to greet the founder the Visionary leader of Al Tabernacle Christian College our Apostle Edgar Hill Rosco his sons Pastor Jonathan and Pastor Jude sister Abby and the Rosco family at large I am truly honored to be standing before you at this momentous ceremony the 20th anniversity of the best school in the world it's amazing how the two years given to us by the critics has spanned to become 20 years I have been privileged to be called to be what they call furniture of the school my mom says I literally begged to be at the school at the tender age of three thank God I was already party today and Glenn thank God if someone had told me that I would be standing here as an alarmist 20 years later I wouldn't believe you I can still see madal staring as she lowers her glasses and glares into your soul to say perform Jay or he brother Glenn laughing in assembly at to his own jokes my arms still remember the burn as M Teddy drilled us arms up sideways down just to get our attention or the weight in my B in my the weight of the bell in in my hand as I was the designated Val ringer this was way before the bleding sidon of brother Owen's horn was imprinted in my mind I can't forget the assemblies when we'd sing Story and run around the sanctuary the days we spend playing church church or open Gates on the grass or when we'd spot that car driving into the rco parking time Stood Still as we flocked to the driver's side door just to feel the warm embrace when the apostle would hug you I'm just reminded of the first award ceremony okay being a 4-year-old girl I was very young so this was too long the ceremony took way too long but I still remember M Sheila waking me up taking me by the hand and walking with me to the podium as I collected the first and only most popular award it was a good memory in my life I can go on reeling about the wonderful times I've had in this place but nothing can ever compare to the moments spent in in the presence of the Lord whether it be on a Tuesday during break when we would come into the sanctuary to pray or Friday morning when the minister would preach or morning assemblies when a tape would be played or the simple Act of reminiscing on the Sunday or the combined preaching the angel of the lord always graced us with his presence You Never Know What You've Got Till It's Gone I can truly attest to this whenever you having a bad day or feeling distressed if you would just knock on Heaven's Door he would answer you would walk in the hallways you would feel the presence of the Lord or you'd even bump into the Apostle or his sons and you just feel better while walking in the passages I just want to thank God for sending his servant our way for giving him a vision and the Zeal to see it through to fruition I personally don't know where or what I would be if it were not for these walls the safe haven against the evil World a place that not only nurtured us and fed us naturally but spirit spiritually the school hasn't only produced doctors accountants engineers and lawyers but it produced learned individuals who know who God is and where he can be [Applause] found I want each and every one of us to take a look around every brick every pillar every window and every door if you don't believe in the Supernatural you are sitting in a miracle that took 9 years I mean 9 months 9 months people to materialize when he laid the first four bricks appointing Michael Gabriel rapael and urel I believe that the Apostle made provision for everything that has transpired in these 20 years thank you Lord for sending your gift our way thank you Apostle for a vision that saw us through and thank you to the Rosco family that gave their father to us Proverbs 22:6 says train up a child in the way he should go and when he is old he will not depart from it thank you Lord for a place that taught us how to fly with both Wings God bless you K just give another beautiful [Applause] hand the next individual one of the first great 12s in 2005 the first head girl of el Tabernacle Christian College in the Year 2005 currently practicing as a chartered accountant can we welcome Jolene [Applause] ludik so I may be from the first class but uh I will say that I keep up with the time so excuse me as I just log in prudy um it's such an honor and a privilege to be here um I must say as I walked in I couldn't help but remember that first day brother Glenn and the small wall at the back there and it just became so real for me um it is an incredible honor and a blessing and a privilege to stand here and speak a little bit about the school and the impact that the school has had on my life so I just firstly want to start by acknowledging the man of God I I think that it goes without saying when you see a man's fruits and his works you cannot doubt that God is with him and I I couldn't help but remember I think it was in Petoria and prudy alluded to this when the Apostle actually announced his vision for this church and the school came with that Vision as well and I remember the Apostle saying that this school will become one of the greatest Outreach mechan mechanisms of the ministry and you know today as I sit here and I think and I look at the faces that sit before me and the ones who have sat in the seats that you now occupy so many Souls that have come through this ministry we can't but thank God for a gift in this [Music] ministry and the and I think it would be a great miss if I do not acknowledge our leadership Pastor Jonathan Pastor Jude Sister Abigail the rosow [Applause] family I remember even sister Sheila the first day and when I came into the ministry I was still a young Christian a very young Christian uh when I came into the school and theila was so instrumental in helping me understand a lot of things and I just want to acknowledge her as well and then I think to just end off my introduction I'd like to just appreciate the teachers of e Tabernacle brother Glenn brother Owen all of the teachers each each one I think that you are handpicked you are chosen of God to cross paths with so many lives and make a difference you may never know the impact that you have um in our lives and I think each of us can attest to a special moment that we share and we carry that with us it's it's those Eternal moments that carry us when we don't feel like we can carry on so thank you to you may God bless you in your efforts as you support the man of God and as you continue this great work so I've been called upon to speak a little bit about the school and uh that includes me as well brother Glenn I when I started I remember with the open day I was very determined to um be in a good good school and overambitious um always wanting to be in a space that I know I'll be able to do well and do my best so because of that and not knowing much about the school it was the first year my mom had arranged for me to have a one-on-one with brother Glenn and uh I I asked brother Glenn I remember sitting in that back classroom brother Glenn you may not remember but I do and I sat down very serious face and I said brother Glenn I just want to make sure you know that this is the right place for me you know and I'm going into matrick and this is an important year and I really just want you to give me that assurance and you know brother Glenn uh gave me that expression which I think many of you can relate to it's a change in the face and it's it goes very serious and you know he you know so I came asking him that and he just turned around and he became very serious and he said to me my sister this is the best place the best school in the world and I have no doubt that you are not going to make a mistake to be in yel Tabernacle and I just took that and I accepted and I walked away and I said you know what um I'm going to give it my all and starting from day one my heart was overjoyed I was like bursting out of my seams because I was so excited to be in a place where I could be surrounded with brothers and sisters of like Precious Faith coming from a a outside school I I just want to give you the short testimony to the young children and Learners City here today um attending an outside school with the dress code a long uniform I remember countless times brother du coming to my home and trying to encourage me to stand despite whatever the obstacle was and those things kept me but when I walked in here it was like home and it wasn't like home I was home and I just want to say to you that the time that you spend here is so critical I have only had the opportunity to be here for one year but I must tell you that this one year was enough to change my life forever I could never be the same after that and I think if I were to just cross over and speak about the school we know that you know the fundamental pillars of the school is to fly with both Wings spiritual and academic and what makes the school so successful and so great and so unique is the spiritual element as I mentioned before I was really young when I joined the school and I needed a lot of help and when I joined the school the thing that always captivated me was the baptism of the Holy Ghost and I'll let you in on a little secret here I know my brother is here you'll probably laugh but just before we join the ministry I um we attended a Pentecostal church and I was so desperate for the holy ghost that I was saying to them you know I really want to change I really want to live right and by then we weren't in the ministry and the the minister is going and he's pushing and uh I was so desperate and then he says raise your hands you know and people start like falling you know in the spirit and then I didn't know the Holy Ghost and I also thought you know what this is the way so I just threw myself on the floor you know like also acting and my brother he was standing next to me with two stoter so um he looked at me and he kicked me saying Joe what are you doing get up you know and um so when I came here I could freely experience the Holy Ghost you know the one thing that I really wanted was that and God afforded me that [Applause] opportunity and I think some of the experiences that I just want to share with you is you know coming out of sister chenel's classroom the classroom was right on the top here on a Tuesday I'll never forget we were fasting and praying and I looked out firstly in the morning the apostle was right here um actually kneeling at the EHR minia and he prayed saints that whole day and the anointing that filled this place I remember being so fascinated and I'm sorry but even as I think about it it's it really touches my my heart and I stood at that window and I looked down and I remember saying God as the man of God sits and lays before you may you place him on my heart on his heart and the Apostle continued to pray that entire day to witness something like that is beyond words it's beyond AC IC achievement it is beyond anything your mind can ever comprehend and I remember thinking that what kind of a man is this that he will sacrifice everything he has for us and because of that I always said God help me that I will keep the hands and arms of the man of God up [Applause] I also remember many times um sitting in the classroom and the Holy Ghost will just pour out it was lifechanging to say the least and for many reasons we can praise the school but I don't think there is a single amount of words that or accolades that that can come remotely close to the impact that the Holy Ghost has on our lives I also just you know in my day-to-day experiences here at the school I think we were privileged to see one another grow brother Glenn um we grew we made mistakes um you know as I stand here and look at the youngsters we made many mistakes but there there was one thing that really resonated with me and it's something I took from the Apostle it's the perseverance I spoke about this brother Glenn you reminded me at my matrick bank with such a simple principle perseverance diligence um Pastor Jonathan once said to me that diligence is the drive to wake up every day and Chase your vision own your destiny and I always kept that with me no matter what and as I begin to speak about academics and corporate you know uh path I really want you to remember that if God could do it for me he can do it for anyone and I I remember when the school just after we met articulated uh the Apostle called us and he wanted us to say what we were going to study and this again I mean you ask yourself on the face of this Earth what kind of school is consistently checking into this day on where their Learners are what they doing and I remember the Apostle um asking each of us we were only nine in matrick and I had U mentioned I wanted to go into education and I remember the Apostle's face he didn't say anything but he just looked at me and something in me told me that I that's not what God called me to do and I went with my passion and thankfully brother Glenn happened to have walked that road before me and so not knowing anything about accounting guys and that's why I want you to if anything take away that in this ministry The Impossible is possible it is possible so as I I matriculated I asked brother Glenn um advice I actually registered for the wrong degree and brother Glenn said to me no Joe you you need to change your degree which I did and I want to thank you brother Glen and I went on to study part-time and I was working and studying which is really hard um the values that the school instilled in us as Learners to work hard to persevere and to never give up and I say this with a reason because it took me 12 years to qualify as a chartered accountant and I woke up every day um and I wrote it on my Bridge uh when I got married one of the first things I wrote I really would I want to be a chartered accountant and at that time it was such a big dream for me in my head in my ability it was very impossible but I am so thankful that throughout my journey I was privileged enough to have the Apostle Pastor Jonathan the leadership of this church and specifically Pastor Jonathan very instrumental in guiding me throughout the journey journey and the gift in this ministry is beyond measure sense I hit the roadblock where I couldn't pass one subject and it was really difficult I told myself this is it I'm giving up and I remember saying to pastor jnan this is it I'm not I can't this is I can't go further than this Believers Pastor Jonathan actually said to me why are you answering a question like this this is how you must answer it and believe it or don't believe it it's my experience it's my testimony and you won't believe it saints that was the exact method to that subject I I did not do something [Music] else so to be found in a place where you are surrounded by God men men of God that are ordained and that have our best interest at heart is the greatest blessing I could ever asked for and I want to close by saying that yes I may have attained the ca I may have attained I attained my goal but I've also been taught don't be satisfied and so as I continue my journey journey I hope to inspire the young mind sit standing and sitting before me here and say and leave you actually with these words Pastor Jonathan once also said that um the more salt you get the thirstier you become and the more you drink and the salt are those challenges it's way when you are most weak when you can't see your way out Pastor Johnson says that's the time when you need to actually use that to own your destiny so I really want to encourage you and say today as I stand Here I Am the general manager of finance Global for a big multinational uh Health um equipment and devices company and I don't say this for my Accolade I only say this to show the power of this ministry the power of the vision of the man of [Applause] God and I want to close with this phrase Pastor Jude said in when he preached Miracles he said you have two choices you have a choice in life life where you choose to say that there are no Miracles and the other way is to say that every day is a miracle and for me today is a miracle it will always be the first day I stood at that war brother Glen was a miracle in my life and it will always be and we know also that time gives you things it's also something that Pastor Jonathan always says time gives you things and as we reflect on the 20 years I thought about it this morning brother Glenn God gave the school many many blessings many many blessings but may it not stop here may God continue to bless you bless the school bless the Learners bless our leadership and I just want to say thank you to my Apostle I want I want to salute you and I want to thank you with everything within me thank [Applause] you JY just give sister Jolene another beautiful hand the likes of sister Prudence a beautiful hand at this time I'm going to welcome brother Jal Augustine a grand son of our Apostle and the visioner of the school just to give us a synopsis on the history of the school can we just [Applause] welcoming [Applause] amen esteemed guest teachers parents and and cherished members of the AL Tabernacle Christian College family I greet you all in the wonderful name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ it's a great honor and a privilege for me to stand in front of you this morning I also can't believe that the the school is 20 years today um at this moment I'd like to greet our Senor Pastor Jonathan Pastor Jude Pastor Edgar Jor and the Rosco family at large and in her absence Mama Sheila who touched our lives and the lives of countless students and will forever be in our hearts her dedication to the school was unmatched as you saw in the clip how she rang that Bell amen and most of all last but definitely not least I'd like to greet God's Apostle Apostle edgil [Applause] Rosco they say you truly can't Savor a meal without recognizing the chef Behind The Culinary Masterpiece they say you can't grasp the essence of a novel without recognizing the author who crafted its Pages they say you can't embrace the beauty of a garden without appreciating the hands that meticulously planted and nurtured each Blossom they say you can't truly feel the power and Grace of the sculpture without acknowledging the sculptor who skillfully chiseled life into stone so this morning before I speak to you about the history of the school allow me to acknowledge and show appreciation for the one that God gave a vision to to build a school in Walkerville this morning just allow me to show some appreciation and acknowledgement to the founder the Visionary the leader that built and shaped Al Tabernacle Christian College to what it is today Apostle Edgar Hill Rosco amen as I look back in all my Years of Living never have I found a man that is so unwavering so dedicated so hardworking so zealous for God Apostle as we look through this 20 years of Al Tabernacle Christian College we can truly say your loving was not in vain what you truly stand for an embody is found in the core and the foundation of the school never have I been with the Apostle and God is Not on his lips never have I spoken to the Apostle without wisdom stepping to the Forefront so this morning when you look at the school you know the foundation of the man that built it it was not only to educate but to save it was not built to empower only but to protect it was not only there to create professionals but to create Holy Ghost filled professionals the heart of the school is Holiness Holiness unto God so let's just take this time to salute God's Apostle for creating a god- centered environment where our children can thrive in the Holy Ghost Apostle we salute you this [Applause] morning [Applause] amen so this morning I was tasked to just give a brief synopsis of the school's history on this momentous occasion celebrating two years two de Decades of unwavering dedication and a Relentless pursuit of Excellence let me take you on a journey that began in 2005 defying the naysayers and the Skeptics who D to question our very existence the naysayers said the school will only last a year maybe two at most but Al Tabernacle it's 20 years to today by the grace of God the school is still standing amen while other pastors were playing the fool Apostle Rosco was building a school in the face of uncertainty Apostle Edgar Hil Rosco's Vision birthed not just the school but a testament to the miraculous power of faith and vision from the the decision to start grade R to 12 simultaneously in 2005 to the groundbreaking achievements of our first grade 12 class of 05 securing 100% pass rate Al Tabernacle set the stage for a legacy of Triumph Against All Odds a paradox the school achieved numerous 100% Pass rates in grade 12 multiple distinctions and Bachelor passes throughout the 20 years I've also been so privileged to count myself amongst the L Tabernacle alumni I started in grade one in 2005 and so happens that my grade one teacher is here today amen and I matriculated teacher IRA and I matriculated in 2016 and like I heard prudy said you only realize something when it's gone amen and I must say you realize the impact of the school once you walk out those doors you just feel and know you cut from a different piece of cloth amen and that leaves an indelible Mark in your life that can't be erased in 2016 we embrac the future with open arms ushering in a digital era of teaching and learning the introduction of tablets not only revolutionized education but became our Lifeline during the unprecedented challenge of covid-19 showcasing the foresight that defines our institution our graduates now scattered across diverse Fields many of medical doctors mechanical engineers electrical engineers Advocates teachers numerous qualifications in the biomed and forensic field Chartered Accountants investment bankers and bom graduates Galore are living embodiment of Excellence master's degrees have been earned distinctions celebrated one of our students achieved distinctions in all his subjects in grade 12 and the spirit of Al Tabernacle is imprinted in each and every success story amen yet beyond the academic accolades our journey is etched with divine intervention the spiritual front of Al Tabernacle is unparalleled across the 20 years over a thousand Learners baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ students enveloped in the presence of the Holy Ghost the school as a scent of Outreach is unmatched True Discipleship is to bring someone into the presence of the Holy Ghost the school

come and wave [Music] amen just wave to the church there [Music] amen these are our young preachers amen may God bless them as well amen God bless are you happy to be here the greatest Miracle is the building you standing in to have attained this building 20 years ago is a miracle then to have the church in this building is also a miracle and then to have the visioner of this great building and this church is a miracle and to have a school around this building just the brick work alone is a miracle that had to be built and then to build a school in the building there two different aspects is also a miracle and then to still have it standing after 20 years is even a greater [Music] Maro I um must say that during the time of Co we really went through a hard patch with the school and the man of God never wavered or said anything we thought we're going to hit a bad spot but we survived Co we survived low student turnout and right now we sitting here in this Tabernacle with the opening of the school which is a supernatural school there's lot of schools but to have a supernatural one it's an honor to see it with your eyes this is a miracle Upon A Miracle on upon a miracle and I realized you can leave the school you can finish your career you can leave the school but the school won't leave [Music] you it's a school of academic achievements and the spiritual achievements cannot be compared to anything that you know or that anybody knows we want to thank the teachers that has been here for 20 years I just want to give them they also a [Music] miracle they are great Mir I think you can give them [Music] a I saw brother Glenn very emotional to see his ex- students but he's not supposed to focus on the ex students he must focus on the current students at because what we did for them we have to do for these that has come amen and even more amen want to welcome all the parents all the EX matriculant may God bless you I will not be a long time is going on and we still have some speakers behind me amen so I like to read the scripture just say something and then we'll go on because we can be here the whole day and still not get to the bottom of it all amen um the Book of Genesis 28 I want you to remember that December was a great convention the Apostle preached a very great sermon here for the two meetings but then I realized that the church was before the school so that 20th convention we had here with what the Apostle preached made I have a jubilee as Al Tabernacle not the school just Al Tabernacle 20 years in this building was also a great miracle today is the follow on of their 20 years I don't know if you with me this morning oh it looks like you forgot that there was a convention and you forgot what was preached there was nothing ever preached like what was preached at our 20th year and I thank God that I was here to hear it and you were here to hear it now the scripture I'm reading is just in light of what we are seeing here Genesis 2811 and he lightened upon a certain place so there's lot of places but there is a certain place and I want you to know and tell the one next to you this is a certain place it's not any place it's a certain place L Tabernacle is not any place you bringing your child to the school it's not any place it's a certain place it's a put out Place ordained by God so we are standing in a certain place you didn't come here by accident God brought you to a certain place this building was built because it's a special place there is no other place like this certain place called Al tacle you are standing in a certain place out of all the places you know this is the certain place it is even better than the house you live in this is a certain place this place is ordained of God for the time we're living in so you don't know and I don't know but this is God's certain place it's a special place of worship you cannot worship ship God anywhere you need to find the certain [Music] place are you in the certain place I want to ask you how did you get here did you plan it did you work it out God brought you to the certain place this eighth Road God put out before the foundation for you you see how those ex matriculant were singing and dancing and being in the spirit they had to all come and leave where they were to the certain [Applause] place and he tered all night because the sun was setting and he took stones of that place and made it his pillow for 20 years we made this our pillow we made this place our resting place we made this place a place where we say I'll rather be a doormat in Al Tabernacle than to be sitting at [Music] home this is a certain place and this is a place where we can rest and have a Sabbath and a rest and and he laid down in the place to sleep and the Bible says he dreamed the dream and I realized we all were in this dream of Al Tabernacle and I want to ask you my brother my sister since we in the school and in L Tabernacle don't wake me up from Hall this dream Don't Wake Me Up To See God moving every week every Sunday every Wednesday I don't want to be woken up because this dream is a wonderful dream called Al Tabernacle why it's a certain [Music] place it's a beautiful place it's a place where you can feel God it's a place where you hear God and it's a place where you can see God this is the miracle of this place don't wake up because the dream we're having here is been fulfilled in front of our [Music] eyes we always says where is God and where's the right church and is there a place where you can meet God I want you to know you in that place and some of you have been here for 20 years is and still you need to be convinced that this is the [Music] place oh but I want to tell Lucifer I want to tell our critics I want to tell all the court cases where to go to I want to tell the old Midville Council this is still the [Music] place we had to go to the high court but this is still the place they wanted to close the school but this is the place there is no place like Al [Music] Tabernacle and why do I say so open your eyes and look it's still happening after 20 years just look I want you to look look around you no you're not you you're not doing what I'm telling you open your eyes look around you and tell you we still here and we still in the place let's give a lord of [Music] shabat oh my brother my sister you know sometimes you got to wait 20 years sometimes to see the miracle but I saw every year a miracle and you know where was that Miracle on the stage every year there was a miracle a some child made it through and they still in the place they finished school but they still here and their children is here and their parents is here why it's the [Music] place don't look for another place we found the place we found God we found a letter and God on top of the letter and God has come down here every time not one s not one cent that we spent to build the place and not one cent that we spent in 20 years can match one of the souls not one Soul could be bought with all the money we spent it was worth it all I want you to give the Lord a Shabbat I want you to jump where you are standing I want you to scream to the Lord show the devil and tell the devil th th th th th is the place why because God has a man in this place God bless you h oh [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] h [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] h [Music] [Music] [Music] he [Music] h [Music] [Music] oh [Music] [Music] [Music] oh [Music] [Music] [Music] a [Music] amen as you welcome our Apostle this [Music] [Music] morning [Music] give me just raise [Music] our because because [Music] he how I love [Music] J oh how I love [Applause] J How I Love Jesus give [Music] our love to [Applause] be he is so he is so wonderful [Music] to he is [Applause] [Music] [Applause] so J Love [Applause] [Music] that reminded me of the night of nights when I met the greatest man that ever [Music] loved the Lord Jesus [Music] Christ they [Music] sang the song and it was like a brand new song oh how I love [Music] Jesus from that moment I have never lost my [Music] love for Jesus king God [Music] we um greet you in his wonderful name I need to apologize I I see everybody's got Ties on and suit on and and the founder of this Bolding in this organism you know looks like this but I've got the colors [Music] [Applause] on so um I thought we just going to sit around and and um and celebrate it cannot be rubbed out it cannot be brushed underneath the table neither can it be ridiculed that this could have only been [Music] [Applause] God for a black man like me to have had a vision like this is unheard heard of a vision that don't end here a vision that's growing as the years flies by it'll go into [Music] eternity because there people that decided young people that come to this school that has decided that they're not going to die the death of an unrighteous that Vision has gone far beyond the grave to the other side of the Ring where the king of glory is waiting for them therefore we didn't have a vision like Mandela had for the put South Africa South Africa that's been cursed by the Jews and the curse is short coming you'll hear tonight what I have to say I'll rather be a Zimbabwean now than to be a South African because a curse is thrown over us whosoever curs Israel God said they will be cursed amen so your vision is not for a struggle I mean we've been in the struggle I've been in the struggle and we thought that the ANC is going to take the struggle away but I'm in a worse struggle now than when I ever was before I'm still struggling therefore these kids hasn't had a vision of thec and Mandela they have a vision of [Applause] Jesus we are not Muslims and we're not Jewish we don't follow mammad to Muhammad and we don't follow Moses we follow the greatest man that ever lived and his name is Jesus and that's what we bow the school on yes sir and that's what we're going to fight for and that's why we're going to stand for the time we have down here might not be very long so I'm sorry that I I look like this casual and uh but it's not the clothes that makes you something what in [Applause] here so may God Rich you bless you you know there's nothing you can do against fruit I don't have to say anything yeah I mean it's been displayed what this is all [Applause] about you don't have to guess what fruit is here you can see it with your own eyes you want to know who somebody is if you want to know who somebody is don't look on how popular he is and all that look at his [Applause] fruit if he steals money and bankrupt a country then what fruit did he bring he stole and fruit is stealing and sto stealing so our fruit will carry on I'm so happy when I saw the ex great 12 a whole church do you know a much [Applause] that act grade 12 as doctors and lawyers and just what you saw yeah and you want to tell me that's not fruit the school has proven itself and that's only the natural side the spiritual side over the the Christmas weekend at our convention was the greatest time I had for my 57th years of serving God in a Ministry that God could give me the keys Stone Revelation in the spiritual realm there has never been messages preached like what was preached over that [Applause] weekend we could clearly and honestly say and I I make no bones about it because I think my job is done yes that we have angels in [Applause] attendance and for the people that had trusted me when I opened the school some of your children is here and they have children now you saw them up here they were children but now they mothers and they they fathers they got children your investment has come to the for today to show you the money you spent it's not worth one of these Souls that was on the spit [Applause] for so it is one of the greatest things that could ever happen in South [Applause] Africa so I just got a few comments to make and uh I don't have to talk you know talk becomes very cheap when you see things like this because the fruit overwhelms it the proof of the pudding is in the eating I only realize after many years what a school entails the beginning of a plant or a seed in the hearts of a child to prepare him for the future the beginning is the school where you plant that seed and that seed is actually there for the future of that child what that child is going to be in the future you planted it right here the mothers and the fathers only have a couple of hours with a child but the teachers is there all the time with a child planting sees either of discrepancy or seeds of Eternity we made it sure that you're not going to have an educated sinner well educated but morals gone we made sure that they're going to be educated but they will have models that no other school will [Applause] have we make sure that what we planted we won't be sorry tomorrow when we see the fruit coming standing here after 20 years I planted that seed way back there with the teachers that was with us and after 20 h I can stand right here now and see the fruit that that seed is producing amen and here they are the husband and the wife come from the school and they are married and they brought for children and that children that they brought forth will be exactly the way they are because the seed don't change if it's a apple it's a apple if it's a pear it's a pear it's a bring forth after its kind and these little guys here has seen today what God has planted 20 years ago May that seed go into them and they do the same thing and become the same fruit of that very very teaching of the [Applause] teachers I wouldn't topel the fight that we had because in intimity I was going to read two verse 15 study to show thyself a proof and that's what we told them study study and here we had on the platform people that took that little bit they studied to show themselves approv today they can take out their certificates and say I'm this and I'm that and I'm that why they studied to show them themselves approved right here today in front of your eyes I am this now and I am that now and I am that now they are proven testimonies of the seed that we [Applause] [Music] [Applause] planted and as I said it didn't go without a fight we had to fight through it I thought Lord how are we going to make it in the covered because the school was closed and we still paid the teachers while they weren't teaching for 2 years now who carried us through not this way there's somebody that's supporting the cause from heaven and we didn't skip one month to pay the teachers and that was in the critical times that was in the bad times that was in the times when we were in the boom backs that God still come behind us and say man it is enough money to pay them and I'm sure that if there's anything ahead of ush that he wants the school if he didn't want the school it had to be closed down but he wants the school and the school will go from strength to strength uh from Victory to Victory from overcoming to overcoming and we'll fight for [Applause] it I will say that we had hard time because you can only judge the good times through the hard times I like what my old sister used to tell me says Edgar when you hit the devil hard watch how hard he's going to hit you then you know whether you're hurting and I'm sure today he hurt because they gave us one year that school only last one [Applause] year uhh it's not what he said it's not what he [Applause] said I'll admit that there was times that we felt like throwing in the towel and those were the times when the plun needed to be pruned so to cut off we to cut off here and cut off there so that the main thing can grow and friends we cut off if we have to cut off we cut off because we know when you cut and you prune more fruit will come after that and because of our cutting more fruit comes from there I will stand here if I have to cut or cut if I have to prune that seed I'll prune it if I have to get rid of the dry Twigs I'm going to get rid of the dry Twigs because I need a living twig uh because the Twigs must love uh I shall not die but I shall love to praise the Lord [Applause] amen and you know after the Twigs was cut off and the dried Twigs was gone I see the people dancing in front you and now you little boys here look at them did you see how they worship they already had that seed in them Hallelujah said hey I must go down and praise the Lord I am not here because of me there's somebody within me that's holding the rain there's something within me I cannot explain there's something within me that gives me strength to carry [Applause] [Music] on so the hard times was the times we went through the wall of critics we were boycotted from all the churches but we carried on we were in the Hall of [Applause] critics but now we out in a Hall of [Applause] Fame now our Fame is growing that even other schools wants to steal our teachers that's the worst thing when you become famous they offer your teachers something better there is no something better than elet because here you have the spiritual side which no school has the spiritual [Applause] side you have god with you and you have education with you how can you lose you can't [Applause] lose I'm glad for God for the job he gave me he he pays me amen and he makes me win souls hallu where can I get a better job than that I'm not leaving this job even if Raposa said he's a Hamas I'm a Hamas you be a h is your business ra but me I'm a Christian I belong to Jesus [Applause] amen it was sure a vision but a vision without hardship without hard work that tries to block it from happening is there no vision you can have a vision is good but a vision is fought because the devil don't want that thing to be made manifest it's going to be critical against his kingdom yeah when the prophet says Jesus will be born they killed all the young children BOS said they kill the young they kill they always kill the young children when Israel was in Egypt did they kill the young children because that young child if he don't have the right seed will grow up a terrorist so kill him while he's young kill the thing they've been killing children all the time through the Bible so therefore we thank God that hardships goes with a vision you can only know a great vision if you see how many hardships you had to fight boy did we fight hardships the government came along and says well we'll give you 200,000 a month but then we have half of what you got anything in a school half belongs to and that's not even the wages we pay and I said man it would have been a help but I do not want the government in here and for 20 years no government funds NOC funds no Raposa funds is in L Tabernacle this thing is funded by the kingdom of heaven [Applause] [Music] [Applause] 20 years is a lifetime when they say they're giving you life and that's 20 years and up it's a lifetime so there's some people here that gave up their lives to make this a success what I like about a vision God gives you a vision before the foundation of the world but he gives you people that will help you to fulfill that Vision you never know why you had to go and go study to become a teacher but God knew he watches watches you he says I want you in my school I want you to be a teacher in my school I want you not only to bring education and bige headedness I want you to bring amen Holy Ghost educated uh angels of God uh so I'm going to direct you here's my sister from Zimbabwe amen amen God directed her she had to come through Amen to South Africa she can't understand it but I think now she understands it she had to come here and support the vision amen and keep the hands up uh that tries his best uh to bring forth a school uh that is actually the best school in in the south [Applause] oh my oh my oh why he always raises up wonderful workers for his ministers and do we have wonderful teachers [Applause] and I assure you the schol is going from strength to strength because in my bones there's no relaxing Hallelujah in my bones is is I'm never [Applause] satisfied we will go on [Applause] improving and let the dogs bark they bark on this side they bark on this side but the Caravan is moving Al tabacal Christian College is moving [Applause] [Music] [Applause] you know in hard times you have no support because failure is a lonely orphan nobody likes failure it's too lonely to be in a group that fails but in that hardship you find people that's got H they don't look here they look down there and down there there's a light in the [Applause] tunnel and I thank God for these teachers that Jonathan than that stood with us in the hard times anybody can come to a nice Church anybody can come to a nice school when everything is nice and all the problems is solved but nobody comes to a place where there's problems and heartaches it take Faith than inivision to be able to stand and see the thing through and I thank you for standing with us in the time of trouble and in the time of me I had had my back covered and today I can for sure say just what you saw on this platform a whole church a whole church came out of the school worshiping God being born again having the peace of God in their hearts amen and having one thing in their mind is to serve God and serve God only and the young people that shows the old people that hey we have found the price uh the pearl of great price and we're not turning back amen we are holding fast uh we have saw the vision uh and we are following the vision uh and we get Victory through the vision uh and the vision will see us through and boy God God Amen isn't the Sur Vision look around you isn't the a vision they say are you going to build a church like this you're a colored man or you're a black man where are you going to find the money only a white man can do this no my brother I've been in the conference of God I've been in the presence of God and he said P it [Applause] [Music] and here you [Applause] are and it's just growing and growing so thank you very much it's so nice to have worked with you for these many many years how many 100% passes did we have JL rolled it out so apply and so good and today even the schools outside says there is no models as good as the children that comes from El Tabernacle I want to say this in closing sometimes I walk the shopping malls and as I walk I just see somebody runs up to me Apostle Apostle T I don't know there there's too many people in L Tabernacle I'm so glad that uh we can call one another brother and sister and not names you understand because I'll never be able to know all the names I was walking there pushing the groceries in the trolley and this guy said to me uh hang on Pastor hang on I'll push this trolley for you and then uh I hang on and he pushed the trolley and I thought let me ask you you know uh where do you come from I said brother

it is and uh I said yeah he says yeah well U don't you remember me I said I said no and she says uh All My Children went to school at your school which is the best school in all of South [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] AF and my heart jumped within me if she didn't watch me out of dance because there's a testimony there there and it could never ever happen if God didn't direct you teachers footsteps to this place to make it [Music] happen I was saying in Victoria I appreciate my job so much that I said not even Mandela know I'm called higher than him cuz God tells the prophet going tell aab the king I say thus sayeth the Lord you don't repent the dog dog will eat his wife's flesh he's higher than a king a man of God a man of vision a man that comes from the Throne of God a man that
