TRANSCRIPT
========================================
is there a time that men will be cut off according to God's Bible when will the 70th Jubilee be the expected time the desired time for God to come not the desired time that edar Rosco said because everybody said something the 7-Day Adventist also had a date and it failed the Jehovah Witness had a date and it failed because it was their date but the 7the Jubilee is nobody's date but yahweh's date that's the difference Lord what will the end be go your way there it's concealed until the time of the end when you see a preacher preach on Maranatha then it sounds for you what will the end be that's why he says it will be the Asing in of the Millennium because the 6,000 years is finished we moving into the seven Hallelujah waited the only thing that can change that date is the longsuffering of Christ nothing more my spirit shall not always strive with men cut off time have you realized that such a short time left in the short time time God in the short time amen Los Angeles has to go down in the short time that woman has to raise in America and 2024 is the USA elections again could it be the date that that woman will be elected that will cause America to go down yes b b yes you will see them going down Los Angeles we are not here forever there must come an appointed time for God to come and isn't there an appointed time for men on the earth yes there is you have prayed maybe five times a day like the Muslims maybe three times a day like the Jews but now you have to pray without ceasing
