TRANSCRIPT
========================================
I believe we are in the wrong fight and I cannot believe what I [Music] was. I went to his house but the Holy Ghost is gone. I came to his house and Holy Ghost is gone. But I tried to leave something behind us. [Music] Now there is a beast that's taken my brain. You can put me to bed, but you can't feel my pain. You could put me to bed, but you can't bear my pain. Leaving the soul from the I'm just trying. I'm trying to leave something behind in the footprints of Jesus God. [Music] is free but the [Music] holy cost more than our [Music] bra come by simply it's so hard to read the future ahead it's already and it's time to leave hunting behind in the footprints of Jesus [Music] King. Now I've got this feeling that I'm still at the shore and my pockets don't know what it means to be poor. I can get through the wall if you give me a door. All the doors is closed. It's time to leave something behind in the footprints of Jesus King. Oh, wisdom is lost in the trees somewhere and you're not going to find it. It's a mental [Music] break. It's locked up from those who hurry ahead. It's time to leave something behind the foot of Jesus [Applause] God. All the money and the ceiling is hard [Music] to when my son stands as a statue of God. He will know what I [Music] meant. Try to leave something behind. I was trying to leave something behind. I was trying to leave something behind. [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] I'd Like I'd like to take a scripture out of St. John 1. It's 46, 47, and 48. And Nathaniel said unto him, "Can there any good thing come out of the El Tabernacle? Philip saith unto him, "Come and see if something good is in Al Teabernc." [Applause] Jesus saw Nathaniel coming to him. Yes. Amen. and sayith unto him, "Behold, an Israelite indeed in whom is no G." [Music] Then Nathaniel saith unto him, Whence knoweth thou me? Jesus answered and said unto him, "Before that film called thee, when thou was under the fig tree, I saw thee." Amen. Let us pray. Father, we thank you for the reading of your word. May our past catch up with our future [Music] as Nathaniel's past caught up in his future. [Music] I do pray that you'd undertake for us. Lord, on my birthday, I wanted church. and you gave it to me. What a boom day present. Church. Thank you that I could be in church with people that was there. with me in the confidence to celebrate the gift that you gave Lord. What a gift. Pray that you'd undertake for us in Jesus' name. Amen. Amen. I will take a title from there. I just want to leave something behind. [Applause] [Music] I just want to leave on this birthday something behind. Nathaniel asked him the question, "Since when do you know me?" He says, "When you were in a fig under the fig tree the other day, Now the minute you say I leave something behind, it means that you showed to the past. So Nathaniel, it might have been a couple of days ago in the past. I saw you, but now your past has caught up with your future. And I want to say El Tabernacle, your past has caught up with you in this future that you're living in tonight. Brother Brandham says, "If you weren't there in the beginning, in the past, you're never going to be there in the future." And that is what it is. I'll leave something behind. And brother Brandham took a song on the wings of a snow white dove and he add words to that song that was on the hip parade [Applause] and he put himself in that song. Though I have suffered, in many ways I cried for healing, he took that song and he pleaded on the wings of a snow white dove. Brother Brandham, when he got near his wife and they were laying on the bed, Amen. And he looked into our eyes and he wanted to serenate her. Amen. He wanted to have a loving evening. And then the prophet will take that song. You are my sunshine. My only sunshine. You make me happy when skies are blue. It takes a song. And then and then he preached a whole message. Loving he loved me. dying. He saved me a whole song. He takes that and he starts preaching a message on it. So I tonight want to take this song in all that I tried to do for 79 years. I was just trying to leave something behind. Everybody leaves something behind. Don't care who you are, bad or good, you leave something behind. Some leaves big wolves behind with a lot of money, but they leave something behind. Others leaves a lot of credit behind, but you leave something behind. Others leave legacies, great legacies, but you leave something behind. Others leaves disappointments and that too you leave [Applause] behind. The thing you leave behind become a memory. People remembers. Look at every funeral you attend. They will come and says, "Well, he did this and this and this." What they left something behind. Memories gets left behind. And from memories it become history. And history makes memorials [Applause] because you just left something behind. The great guys of yesterday year left something behind. [Applause] They always leave something behind, something that people could remember them by. Jenkins Khn left something behind. Alexander the Great left something behind. Napoleon Bonapart left something behind. Hitler left something behind. Pelle left something behind. Jack Nicholas with a golf left something behind. You can be a great guy, you're going to leave something behind. You can be a nobody and yet you're going to leave something behind. soul. William Brennham. Yes. Amen. When he cried out, I'm going to leave this Bible for Joseph. Brother Brennan left something behind. Brother Brennham when he took the cloud and he turned the cloud and he said this will go down in history what did he do? He left something behind. Amen. Amen. The pillar of fire that was at the back of his head. Amen. That's hanging all over where you went and go. What was that? He left something behind. All the mysteries of the entire Bible, every nuke, every corner in the Bible, he revealed it. What did he do? He put it on tape because he wanted to leave something behind. Jesus, King God. [Music] When he says, "I have to go to my father, but I'll send you a comforter." He left something behind. He said, he said, "I must go so that he can come because I'm leaving him behind to lead you into all truth." Yes, he left something behind. Jesus, King God. [Music] When he took his final step and he looked back, he saw footprints on the sands of time that's leading to the promised land. What did he do? I can't hear you. What did he do? He left footprints behind. He left something behind. He left something for you to follow. He left something for you to to be guided because he left something behind. [Music] Oh my [Applause] Paul left something behind. So if anybody comes and says seven thunders and seven virtues let him be a curse because even if it's an angel because I left something behind. [Applause] And then I came [Music] to this place. I went before the beginning. I went in the beginning and I end from the beginning. [Applause] [Music] Woo! Hallelujah. [Applause] Heat. Heat. [Applause] Yes. Yes. Yes. I went before the beginning and I came out to a place before the beginning at the great conference of God. And there we were sitting. Amen. In the great conference of God. And here God saw the deceitfulness of Satan before Satan was actually created. God save our souls already. Took the lamb and slay the lamb. I just wanted to leave. I just wanted to leave. I just wanted to leave something behind. [Music] And I look 3.5 billion years ago and God formed the earth 3.5 billion years ago. And as he forms the earth, the ones names that was in the lamb's book of life, they were there already. And they looked at him creating the earth. And the Bible says in the book of Job, where were you when the sons of God shouted for joy when he laid the foundation, I just want to leave something behind. I don't think Lucifer wanted to hear that one. And the sons of God was shouting for joy. And right now, tonight, God's got another man that makes the sons and the daughters of God shout for joy for a new creation. I just wanted to leave something behind. And while while we were shouting, while we were screaming, while we were drunk in the spirit, Lucifer didn't like it. and it caused trouble in heaven. And God says, "Any man that makes trouble in my church, I kick him out." And I saw Lucifer fall down. How have I fallen on Lucifer? And we're kicking him out here tonight because the sons of God is here tonight. Heat. Heat. Thank you. Yeah. [Applause] When I preached that, hallelujah. When I preach that, what did you do, brother Rosco? I just wanted to leave something behind and God made in Eden and I see him drop down in Eden. Lucifer in the body of the serpent a handsome man. The Bible call him a cherubam. Which cherubam? The man cheruban. The one with the face of a man. He was thrown out. Amen. Into the Garden of Eden. And I look at this cherubam. Amen. A man, a serpent. And then I saw what that serpent could do. The weakness of a man. That's why God had to destroy him because Eve would have ran after him all the time and God slayed him. Then I saw evolution coming right up to the serpent. Lord, I saw the chimpanzee. I saw the H Highleberg man. I saw the Nebraska man. I saw the Bolton down man. I saw the peeking man. I saw the neon grateral man. I see the cro-Magnum man. And then I see the serpent man. And then I see the modern man. Amen. Adam. But also then I saw the real man, the only man, the son of man. I just wanted to leave something behind. And I hear a prophet says there'll come a man one time and he'll preach evolution and nobody in the message preach evolution, but he send a boy that is a man. Now I just wanted to [Music] leave something behind. And finally the man came. When he came He was full of blood, thorns on his head. And he stood in front of Pilate. And Pilate looked at him and he looked at this congressman and he says, "Behold the man, the only man I just wanted to leave something behind. [Applause] Brother Brennham was compelled to come to South Africa 1951. There was a reason why he came because there was a little boy [Applause] And that little boy has become a man. And now he just want to leave something behind. That the prophet laid hands on this head. I just wanted to leave something [Music] behind. Sitting in my study, here come a letter from Billy Paul. And in the letter, Billy Paul says, "Edgar Roscoll, I only listen to my father and you because you got a very fine spirit. I just wanted to leave something behind. From brother Brandham to Billy Paul, from Billy Paul to brother Higginson, the head deacon of Brennham tabernacle and he came into the sanctuary and he felt the anointing and he said the anointing that's here was the same anointing when brother Brandham preached the same the scripture. is fulfilled and this day the scripture is fulfilled. I just wanted to leave something behind from brother Brandham to Billy Paul to the head deacon of Brandham Tabernacle. knows that something has been left behind. El tabernacle, even Jeffersonville had to acknowledge there's going to come somebody that's going to leave something behind. I can't help who I am because I was chosen to leave something behind. Will brother Stephford come up please? Brother [Music] Steph and this cherubam was walking in the garden of Eden. That's why When we hear we devil chasing. Amen. You sisters that don't respect your husband, we one of these days are going to put you out of the church. Your husbands that don't love your wives, we're going to put you out of the church [Applause] because there is somebody that God said leave something behind. Brother Stephen, will you just give them the testimony so that we can just leave it behind. Thank you. Amen. Let's give the Lord a hand clap. Amen. The apostle just wants me to share a short testimony with you. Amen. I was working in this company and in one of our subsidiary companies was a colored guy and this guy wanted an appointment with me and every time he comes to my office I wasn't available and then I said to my PA I said listen just schedule this appointment with this guy. tell him when he comes we make an appointment and I'll see him. So he came and he came under the guise of wanting career advice. But really I could hear when we started to talk. He said he knows I'm a Christian. He knows where I serve El Tabernacle. He knows my apostle Edgar Rosco. So I said to this guy, his name is Nathan Operman. So I said, "Nathan, how do you know my apostle?" He says, "Brother Stephford, let me tell you something." He says, "My father is like a bishop in the AFM church." And around the late 70s, I think around 1977, Kenneth Hagen came to South Africa and he had an audience with Kenneth Hagen, his father Andrew Operman. And this young boy Nathan, he went with his father and he was sitting there when Kenneth Hagen spoke to his father. And Kenneth Hagen said to his father, that was around 1977 when he came to South Africa. He said, "You need to associate yourself with a man by the name of Edgar Rosco. He said that man carries the power of God. And you know as we were talking it only became clear to me. So I told him about the church and all that but it only the puzzle came together only later when his father put in his will that when he dies the apostle must bury him. [Applause] So, this was something phenomenal to me and we wanted to get it on tape and we spoke to him and he said, "No, we'll do it. It'll come on tape." But by the time we wanted to finalize it, he had stage four cancer and within 4 days after speaking to me, he passed away. But his father was buried by the apostle and we all know the rest is history what happened at that service. So to the man of God we salute you and we want to say happy birthday pastor. You definitely left something behind. God bless you. Thank you. Thank you. Now that's the same man that Sol Ranica and them was under that was his mentor. Every Tuesday they had studies with Andrew Oppaman and Andrew Oppaman's got a better chance than Solar Renica. Exactly. And I do not know Kenneth Copelan and all those guys, but you know, God does things like this just to leave something behind. What fruit is on the tree? One of the elders said to John the bride, hallelujah, part in El Tabernacle. told you, "Weep not. You're safe. Weep not, John. You're safe. Just follow the footsteps that's left behind. And I asked the Holy Ghost, who is that elder? And nobody ever mentioned it. And it came down that elder is none else than Paul because Paul was in the third heaven and Paul saw the lamb there that takes away the sons of the world and he cried out, "Don't cry. The line of the tribe of Judah has prevailed. And I came and told you now I leave something behind. Oh my. And that anointed cherubam. It reminds me of the two cherubams that's on the ark. On the one side, the face of a man and on the other side, the face of a lion. Now, you never heard this in a message. They know nothing. Who's that? Two cherubams. Face of a man and a face of a lion. couldn't have been anybody else because the lion of the tribe of Judah has become a man and he poured out his blood on the mercy seat. Hallelujah. I'm just leaving something behind. That was not good enough. I just want to young people. I just want to I just want to leave something behind. Thank you. I was laying in my bed in Jerusalem. Oh Jerusalem, Jerusalem, how beautiful is your mountains. And when David saw it, he says, "I lift up my eyes towards the mountains where from my strength come." I was lying in between the mountains of Jerusalem and he came down and he told me, "You're not going outside seeing today." I said, "Lord, why can't I go out today?" Said, "You s and you read Revelations 10." I said, "But I I know Revelations 10. It's my bread and my butter, Lord." He said, "You stay behind in Jerusalem." I went down. And I said, "Lovey, I can't go out. I can't go sightseeing. I can't go out with you. I must stay." He told me to read a Revelation 10. And they left and I was in the room alone between the mountains that David saw. And shortly here round about 11:00 I think my strength came from the mountains. And as I read Revelations 10, I saw that the Bible says, "And when the seven thunders uttered there," he says, "Stop there." You said that's that's a word that you couldn't spell. When you spell there, you spell it t h e r e. But this is t h e i r. This is human beings. And if the seven thunders are there is seven human beings. And what is utter? Utter means speech. What is utter means preaching. He says the seven thundersu is the seven messengers of the seven church ages and the revelation came down where my strength come. Hallelujah. I just want to leave something behind. [Music] Oh my [Music] [Applause] And then [Applause] to 20 24, he said, pick up Revelations 10 again and read it through. I must still come back and preach the entire Bible folded in Revelations 10. It might it might be the whole year. I don't know. And I started to read it verse by verse. And I came to Revelations 10:8. And I saw Brother Bram says, "That's the bride." He said, "But now watch now. It's the bride. But the sisters is in the bride, too. But they don't prophesy. It's only men that prophesy. So it must be in the five-fold ministry that prophesy." And I he said to me, "Now, who in the five-fold ministry is prophesying again?" And I wasn't ashamed to tell him Edgar Rosco Revelations 10:8. Hallelujah. I just want to leave something behind. [Music] [Applause] And then he gave me Revelations 22 to hook up with Revelations 10:8. Amen. John, see that you don't seal up the prophecy. Now, how could he not seal up the prophecy if he's not going to prophesy again? The only way to keep it open, preach on it for a whole year. I just wanted to leave something behind. [Music] Then I went around the world in a message and all that I heard the word. The word the word the word spokes quotes the word. And I said, "Lord, there's something wrong here." And then he spoke to my heart. He says, "Edgar, there's four parts to the word." [Applause] Oh, I said, "Lord, which four parts?" He says, "The written word don't save you." Everybody preach it. The spoken word don't save you. That's for third Paul. Squirrels. The revealed word don't save you. The minute he says flesh and blood didn't reveal it to you, Peter, the next verse says God told him, "Get behind me, Satan. That don't save you." But what saves you? The living manifested word is the only thing that saves you. I just wanted to leave something behind. [Music] Amen. The loving word saves you. Why? Amen. Then he opens the Bible for me. He says, "Some seeds fall on rocky places. That don't save you. Other seeds fall in between thorns and it gets choked. That don't save you. other word word word falls on dry places that don't save you. So it's not word word but the word that falls on good ground that saves you. Four parts to the word of God. I just want to leave something behind. And then another thing that made me sick is whenever I go, brother, you got to love, man. You got to love, brother. You know, Brother Rosco's got no love. You know, there's no love. Nothing. Amen. And then I walked up and I found in the message rejected King. Brother Brandham says the Holy Ghost is love. [Music] [Applause] Then I found out that the book of Galatians says love is only a fruit of the spirit. Not the spirit is the fruit of love. Love comes out of the baptism of the Holy Ghost. Cannot be any other way. only a fruit. Only a fruit. Then I read Romans 5:5. Could you read it with me? Romans 5:5. How does the love come into your heart? So without the Holy Ghost, no love. [Music] There is seven steps of love. Which love are you talking about? Amen. My Lord. Amen. And amen. Lord. Hey. Then he sings on the wings of the snow. White. What is the white dove? He says, "And love is on the wings of a dove to the wings of the Holy Ghost." Oh, and then I read in the Bible, there's only a time to love. You can't laugh all the time. When are you going to get a re a time to rebuke? When are you going to get a time to hate sin? And there's only a time to laugh. But you want to laugh all the time. When Jesus knocked them out of the temple, where was love? [Applause] Hey, I just wanted to leave something behind. I just wanted to leave something behind. [Applause] [Music] [Applause] The 1979 I walk into the classroom still under the umbrella of the teeth the Holy Ghost without emotions. And when I went in there and preached for 10 minutes chairs went through the window, sisters got slain. The hallelujah and the glory to God was like they shouted for joy. And the Holy Ghost fell from 79 until now. And it never stop. And it won't stop. I won't let it stop because I'm leaving something behind. Enjoy the Holy Ghost. Enjoy the Holy Ghost. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. [Music] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. [Music] Oh my. Can I have another few moments? that I heard the other day. They said the initial evidence is when the word of God says, "Have you received the Holy Ghost since you believe?" And then they turn around believe what the message for your day. They said, "That's the evidence." Now, the Holy Ghost told me that's right. Did you believe the word for your day since you received the Holy Ghost. They say that's it. But my problem is is dancing in the word, is shouting in the word, is being drunk in the word. Then why don't you believe it and do it? You're a liar. Faith without works is dead. I just wanted to leave something behind. Listen, then Phil thief came when the Holy Ghost poured out in Al tabernacle and he came and he said the Holy Ghost with no emotions. Now there is no quote for that but put that back in the Bible. Where are they going to put it? I know where it is. And I told you where it is. Acts chapter 2, there came a rushing mighty wind, the Holy Ghost. No emotions. It fell up the house. No emotions. They were sitting. No emotions. They had cloven tongues over their heads. no emotions. But after that, the Bible says, "And they received the Holy Ghost and emotions came." Oh, put it back in the Bible. I just want to I just want to I just want to leave something behind. Oh my And then I thought, brother, I thought that I'm screaming. I'm shouting. I am dancing. I'm getting drunk. I'm acting stupid. I thought it it's me. And then I picked up a quote. Brother Graham says it's not you. Is the angel of God inside of you shouting, screaming, dancing. It's not you who's screaming there. I see the angels of God. And then we came back and we took the quote to brother B says turn the cloud to your right side. turn it to the right side the cloud. And then I read he says he's got a wig on. And then I saw he say it's the judge. [Applause] 1963 it's the judge. Do you know that we already judged by the word of the prophet? So, we're not going to the white throne because the white throne is the word of God judging. But the judge already came. And I see a a prophet said, "I'm making this tabernacle a courthouse." [Applause] Hallelujah. He made his church a courthouse. And he says, "I will start preaching warning and judgment." And after he preached warning and judgment, he preached, "Now I already warned you. I indict you now." And after he preached indictment, he went around and preached trial, trial, trial, trial, trial. Five trials. And after he preached five trials, he put them in prison. Souls in prison. They in prison now can never get the Holy Ghost anymore. Why the judge is here? I just wanted to leave something behind. I save you from the prison. I pull the prison bars open. [Applause] Oh, then I preached the seven dimensions [Applause] and I preached Saturday is here. What happened Saturday? He went into the prison in the first dimension of hell and he preached in season and out of season. Out of season, Noah's day in his season, his day and they didn't repent. And after he preached, nobody got saved. It was the third pool. And then he went down to the third dimension of hell. And he rearranged Satan. Even his own devils didn't recognize him. He set captivity captive. He triumphed over the devil. He kicked the devil back into hell again. Saturday is here. Then that same Saturday, the blessed the saints under the sixth dimension. And it wasn't sixth dimension. It was paradise. heard him calking and talking to the thief that was on the cross next to him. And he told the thief, "Don't worry. Watch these doors open." And he came to the doors. He said, "Open up your [Applause] doors." And the angel says, "Who are you?" He says, "I'm the Lord mighty in battle. I conquered hell. I conquered death. And I conquered the grave. [Music] Oh my. So, I'm nearly there. My brother, my sister, you can't put me to bed. You can't put me to bed. Because you can't feel my pain. You can put me to bed, but you'll never know my pain. Pain for 59 years in a message. All the different talks against me. Blessed is the man that when they speak all men of evil against him for my name's sake. You do not know my pain. You can put me to bed, but you don't know my pain. Oh my. I'm nearly closing. I can't get through the wall of these churches in the message. That's right. It's true. Hallelujah. Unless they open the door. But all the doors are closed. And they got the Holy Ghost outside. I can't get through their walls unless they open the door. Paul said, "All have forsaken me." Brother Bram says, "I'm alone." When you're a man of God, you are alone. Money is free. Everybody can get a dollar right up to a billion dollars. Money is free. But the Holy Ghost cost more than your natural bread. Simon the sorcerer wanted to buy the Holy Ghost. He didn't have enough money. Money is free, but the Holy Ghost costs more. Money is free, and the Holy Ghost is too far up the ceiling to reach. [Applause] [Music] Oh, the future head is already dead. Lord, it's already dead. because he's painted to a thread. The Pope is on his dying days. Trump is running wild around the world. Money is getting scarce. I'm trying to leave something behind in the footprints of Jesus, King God. I'm trying to leave it behind. So you can go leave and say goodbye. But here I'll stay in El Tabernacle. I'm not going anywhere because I left something behind. You can lie to me with all those spoken word books that you don't love. Exactly. I can't follow you to the end of the world with all that false doctrines. Why not rightly dividing the word? Making the word of God to none effect. Mis consting the word. Misinterpreting the word. Dislocating the word. Add to the word seven thunders seven virtues add into the world subtracting from the word the Holy Ghost without emotions. I can't follow you till the end. My soul will be lost with all the spoken word books that you can't love. Amen. Amen. Oh, I'm nearing the end. Oh, I nearly forgot. I nearly forgot. I walk into the El Tabernacle church right into the sanctuary. I see a man that was blind once standing in front of the pulp. But now worshiping God. His eyes 2020. I'm just trying to leave something behind. right in the church now. Oh, I look and behold a man leaping and dancing right now in El Tabernacle. So crippled. So crippled that they had to carry him to the toilet. I see a couple man in Craig's door while we were dancing took his crutches and threw it away and started to dance. I just want to leave something behind. This couple man is right here now. Why? I just wanted to Leave something behind. I come into the church, the congregation and I witness three to five people raised from the dead. [Applause] I just wanted to leave something behind. I remember Ptoria as sister Lynette and her husband brought it back to my mind. We were having a meeting at George Martins. Knock on the door. Guy came and asked us to just please come over. His wife just died. The morttery was standing there waiting for him, for her. We went over and Raymond, you were there. Raymond Thompson, you were there. Raymond, Raymond, you were there and we went over and we form a circle around her and I prayed just a simple prayer and she was ice cold. The mortary already wrote out her debt certificate and after I prayed for her, she jumped up and said, "Give me some [Applause] water. I just want to leave something [Applause] [Music] behind." Amen. [Applause] I just wanted to leave something behind. Amen. I behold in El Tabernacle now [Applause] a death and a dumb woman was a teacher at the deaf and dumb school. receive a healing, loose her tongue, and stop her ears before the whole congregation. And them all fainted. And there she is still alive today, yuring and talking. I just wanted to read something behind. [Music] Where's my other sister? That was death. Is she here? That was death. She is right in the church. Her ears is open in the church now. I was astonished in El Tabernacle now. A woman whose tubes was cut out and female parts damaged and the doctor says she will be barren all her life. Her husband's sperm bank couldn't make a half a child. God created human parts, raised sperm banks [Music] like in a third Paul manifestation and she gave birth to two children. There she is. I just wanted to leave something behind. [Music] Hallelujah. I lost count of how many women now in El Tabernacle that was barren that's having babies in their hands babies on the two sides. I even told her, you know, the whole plan wasn't given to them. Hallelujah. To multiply. Amen. Right now in El Tabernacle, wouldn't you like to be in a church like this? I just wanted to leave something behind. A elder in El Tabernacle had to have a heart transplant. You know about the testimony. He came to me. He was on his way to hospital. To have the operation on his heart. I prayed for him. When he got to the doctor says, "Let's just check you again." And they checked his heart again. and they found out he's got a heart like a little child and he's still in E tabernacle. I just wanted to leave something behind. [Applause] I'm nearly closing. He had a heart like a baby. A preacher from Freandal. His mother came to the service in Cape Town, not belonging to the church. But she came and we prayed for her. She was barren. And I think the next month or so, she fell pregnant and she brought this boy forth who is a preacher now in our church. Can thou believe? Can thou believe? Then I just want to leave something behind. [Applause] [Music] [Applause] Brother kid, brother Jerry's son, the elder was deranged. Had a deranged mind. They took him just about all over. Amen. Church to church, sang to Sangoma. [Music] Hallelujah. But he couldn't get his healing. I do not know who told him about El Tabernacle and they brought him to Eel Tabernacle and God whipped his mind. He's in his right mind now. Listen. Listen. He's in his right mind now. He even know how to make babies. [Music] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. I just wanted to leave something behind. All these people is right here. By the grace of God. We had brother Grant Augustine's daughter's birthday the other day and the doctor says she will never make it. She's going to die. They're going to try and save the mother. And we prayed. Brother Grant [Music] gave the testimony and two weeks ago she turned 21. [Music] And you know what? She's now ready to make ground another opa because I just left something behind. What a church. What a church. Oh, God. [Music] We had a convention and the food ran out and there was just a little bit of food left and the queue was full very very long and they prayed The trust is prayed. And as they dish, the food got more. As they dished, the food got more. When they dished the last ditch, there was still food over. Like God multiplied the bread, he multiplied the food. I just want to leave. I just want to leave. something behind for you people. [Applause] I'm closing from Venda right up in the north near Zimbabwe. Amen. To the west, Cape Point. Right to the east, Durban. To the south of South Africa, over 10 churches and thousands and thousands and thousands of souls saved. I just wanted to leave something behind. From the baptism of the Holy Ghost, the token with emotions to the four parts of the word to the four aspects of the Holy Ghost to the son of man, the son of God, the son of David, the son of righteousness, back to the son of God again into the worship like John on the aisle of atmos when the book was open. Why are you worshiping? Because Revelations 10 is open and made plain and prophesied again. Healing accompanied all this. People raised from the dead. What is love? Explain. We explain what is love. The virtues came out of the Holy Ghost baptism. The guide says so. Corinthians 13 said so. Prophesying discernment on the back part of El Tabernacle. See all the prophecies there. Amen. The creation of the earth and the 70th jubilee in 1977. And give me a minstra. Let me dance. The evolution from the chimpanzeee to the serpent man to Adam to the real man, the son of man. Hallelujah. But for me, I enjoy preaching in El Tabernacle where the oil and wine is flowing. Not a painted fire because I left something behind. I just magnified my office when I said I left something behind. And what I like the most after all this, I like this very much. Praise him in the sanctuary. Now it doesn't matter which century. It could be Becket century, Ratif sanctuary, George Martin century. The Bible says praise him in the sanctuary. Why don't they praise him in the sanctuary? Psalm 100 says, "When I come into the congregation, I'm praising him." Because you got to praise him in the sanctu. Praise him in the firminant of his power, the moon and the stars and the Milky Way. Amen. And the black holes and the Milky Way and the zodiac. Praise him for his great acts. Praise he the Lord. Praise him according to his excellent greatness. He's so great. He opened the Red Sea and he's got the power to close it, too. I just wanted to leave something behind. Praise him with a trumpet. Praise him with a trumpet. Praise him with a fluid. Praise him with a sexy phone. Praise ye the Lord. Praise him in the dance. Oh, I got to say that again because they don't can't even dance anymore. Let a old man show them how to dance, man. Praise him in the dance. Don't you want to praise him in the dance? Praise him in the dance. Praise him with the strings, instruments, and organs. Praise him upon the loud symbols. Praise him upon the high sounding symbols. Now here it comes. Let everything that has breath, oxygen, praise the Lord. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. [Applause] Shouldn't put this here. Hallelujah. Everything that has breath. Praise ye the Lord. I don't care if it's a lion. Let the lion's roar be praise the Lord. He's got breath. I don't care if it's a coyote. Let his back be. Praise ye the Lord. If it's the bellow of a frog, let the frog bellow be. Praise ye the Lord. If it's the chipping of cricket, let the chipping of the cricket be. Praise ye the Lord. If it's the buzzing of a bunch of bees, a swarm of bees, let the buzzing be. Praise ye the Lord. If it's El Tabernacle, [Applause] Heat. Heat. If if there's anybody here, if there's anybody here that don't want to praise him, God will wake you up one morning and you'll hear the the the the birds singing and their singing will be to you. Praise ye the Lord. If there's anybody here that don't want to praise him, Jesus says the rocks will praise him. Look at the rocks praising him. Look at it. Why are we praising? Because full obedience to the word entitle you. Don't give it. It only entitles you. For the Holy Ghost. Amen. Amen. My Lord. So if you obey, then you'll dance. If you obey, you will shout. If you obey, you'll speak in tongues. If you obey, you'll clap your hands. If you obey, you will dance. If you obey, you will I want to say this is why I was born. To leave something behind. I left something out. I left something out. When he opened the Bible, God wrote in the beginning. God created the heavens and the earth. In the beginning, the better sheet. And a better when you take it from the right to the left spells out the crucifixion. The Bible open up with the crucifixion. In the beginning, there's the whole thing. It opens up with the crucifixion, the barit. And it closed in Revelations 5. Behold the lamb. Amen. Full of blood. It closes the Bible and opens the Bible.
