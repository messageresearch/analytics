[1:17:12] waste your time
[1:17:24] I do not believe
[1:17:28] that the man should go to church
[1:17:32] just to consume time
[1:17:36] just because you've got nothing to do
[1:17:40] and you feel religious
[1:17:43] and you're going to waste your time then
[1:17:45] you get nothing
[1:17:49] I believe we come to church
[1:17:52] come through the doors
[1:18:04] when you leave
[1:18:07] when you leave
[1:18:11] you should
[1:18:15] feel a difference
[1:18:29] I do not have much more time on this
[1:18:33] Earth
[1:18:35] since the time 1951
[1:18:39] when brother Branham lady's head
[1:18:43] ladies hands on this here
[1:18:48] I'm the only
[1:18:52] I'm the only preacher

[1:19:01] [Applause]
[1:19:04] 1951.
[1:19:08] [Applause]
[1:19:13] and I've been here

[1:19:30] churches in every province in South
[1:19:33] Africa
[1:19:36] [Music]
[1:19:46] I wasted
[1:19:48] no time

[1:20:34] so may God bless you we thank God for
[1:20:37] the mayor and our precious Pastor there
[1:20:48] we thank God that they could
[1:20:51] take off time of their busy schedule
[1:20:57] to be with us
[1:20:59] we do not feel Worthy
[1:21:03] but we do appreciate it
[1:21:14] so without
[1:21:17] any ado
[1:21:20] I like to bail into what I want to do
[1:21:23] today
[1:21:36] if you have
[1:21:39] your weapons with you
[1:21:45] As You Are
[1:21:58] the children of God
[1:22:04] we
[1:22:05] are going to turn our Bibles to familiar
[1:22:08] scripture
[1:22:12] that actually coincide
[1:22:17] with
[1:22:18] the happenings today
[1:22:22] we have
[1:22:24] come from Johannesburg
[1:22:27] to ordain a young man
[1:22:31] We Believe
[1:22:35] the fire of God is in his soul
[1:22:42] that has chosen
[1:22:45] straight
[1:22:47] and another way
[1:22:50] I don't
[1:22:52] easily ordained
[1:22:56] any person
[1:22:58] for my 57 years
[1:23:01] you can count them on one hand
[1:23:05] I first want to see fruit
[1:23:10] before I ordain
[1:23:16] anybody
[1:23:21] and I saw this young man didn't go to
[1:23:24] other churches
[1:23:27] to pull people away from another
[1:23:30] fall
[1:23:32] and he went into the streets
[1:23:39] today we're both churches
[1:23:42] from other churches
[1:23:45] we can't then we split the church to
[1:23:47] start a church
[1:23:51] but you can take your head off for a man
[1:23:53] that comes
[1:23:56] start a church
[1:23:58] without anybody
[1:24:01] outside
[1:24:07] the brothers we think
[1:24:10] I hear you that you made it
[1:24:13] God bless you
[1:24:19] if I can draw your attention to the book
[1:24:22] of Ephesians
[1:24:26] as the scholars
[1:24:31] name this book
[1:24:34] as the best writings
[1:24:37] of the first messenger
[1:24:47] in it
[1:24:49] it dovetails and parallels
[1:24:54] the Book of Joshua
[1:24:57] and Joshua
[1:25:00] is the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:25:10] Ephesians 4
[1:25:12] 11 you know the scripture
[1:25:16] but let us read it
[1:25:20] and he gave
[1:25:23] listen
[1:25:25] how it starts
[1:25:28] and he gave
[1:25:34] some
[1:25:36] not everybody
[1:25:43] although you can
[1:25:45] kick under Every Little Bush
[1:25:48] you kick a pasta out
[1:25:51] but the Bible said there's only some
[1:25:54] [Applause]
[1:25:55] [Music]
[1:26:02] it's not every football player that is a
[1:26:05] messy
[1:26:07] or a Ronaldo
[1:26:09] they all play football
[1:26:12] but there's one run out
[1:26:15] and there's one message
[1:26:25] so the Bible picks out
[1:26:30] of all of them
[1:26:32] some
[1:26:37] thank you
[1:26:40] some
[1:26:45] apostles
[1:26:49] don't stop there
[1:26:52] and some
[1:26:57] evangelists
[1:27:02] it's like a million not everybody can be
[1:27:05] a mayor
[1:27:07] but some
[1:27:13] that's why you can't help but take
[1:27:16] ministers and weigh them out
[1:27:18] you weigh them up
[1:27:24] why
[1:27:25] because some
[1:27:29] [Applause]
[1:27:33] the rest is not only there to fill up
[1:27:37] the Gap but they are not in the Sun
[1:27:41] [Music]
[1:27:48] some Prophets
[1:27:52] yes out of all the guys that say the
[1:27:56] prophets
[1:27:59] there's only some
[1:28:04] that's a real Prophets
[1:28:09] evangelists
[1:28:13] somebody told me brother Roscoe you'll
[1:28:15] never talk about evangelism
[1:28:18] evangelists
[1:28:20] I said now first bring me the guy that
[1:28:23] burns up the whole city
[1:28:25] and then I'll call him the evangelist
[1:28:29] if he didn't bring It One Soul
[1:28:32] then he is but only
[1:28:36] evangelist by name
[1:28:39] but evangelist pulls up to church
[1:28:44] [Applause]
[1:28:47] that's why you only have some
[1:28:52] that bring in Souls I had ministers for
[1:28:55] 40 years great preachers
[1:29:00] educational preachers
[1:29:03] but they didn't bring one Soul into El
[1:29:05] Tabernacle
[1:29:07] not one
[1:29:09] they call themselves evangelists
[1:29:13] but the work of the evangelists
[1:29:16] is not there
[1:29:20] some pastors
[1:29:24] to some of them
[1:29:26] not all of them
[1:29:28] some of them is 40 years here
[1:29:32] they've done nothing and now they leave
[1:29:34] the message
[1:29:36] where do they fall in they fall into
[1:29:38] some
[1:29:43] you cannot just join a church
[1:29:48] you're going to know why you're sitting
[1:29:50] in a church
[1:29:51] [Applause]
[1:29:56] and what will these five guys do
[1:30:01] they perfect the Saints
[1:30:09] and the minister in the church they
[1:30:11] would uplift
[1:30:15] and to edify the church
[1:30:18] they'll do anything
[1:30:21] [Applause]
[1:30:25] let us pray I think I'll really preach
[1:30:31] I'm not going to be able to finish this
[1:30:33] message
[1:30:35] father
[1:30:38] Jesus king God
[1:30:43] Jesus
[1:30:46] king of God
[1:30:51] we bow our heads before thee
[1:30:56] and oh God we're incapable
[1:31:01] to handle this meeting
[1:31:06] but father
[1:31:10] to fulfill all righteousness
[1:31:15] to not shun to declare all the councils
[1:31:22] we will stand in the gap
[1:31:26] and do thy will
[1:31:29] may you bless the reading of your word
[1:31:34] and oh God
[1:31:37] hide me behind the cross so the people
[1:31:39] don't see
[1:31:42] the scum that stands here
[1:31:47] but let they see
[1:31:50] the man
[1:31:53] that can cleanse the leper
[1:31:55] [Music]
[1:31:57] [Applause]
[1:32:02] I asked
[1:32:04] in Jesus name you maybe say that
[1:32:07] I'm sorry that you had to stand so long
[1:32:11] but if we Sing the anthem of South
[1:32:14] Africa
[1:32:15] then we stand the springboks are playing
[1:32:18] today
[1:32:20] and you're going to see they stand to
[1:32:22] the anthem of the hand on their heart
[1:32:25] and if we read the word of God this is
[1:32:28] the anthem of Heaven
[1:32:31] we stand to the word of God Amen
[1:32:38] if I should take a title out of there
[1:32:43] the way
[1:32:45] of a true preacher
[1:32:48] I'm going to ordain a preacher
[1:32:52] and that's why I'm titling
[1:32:55] this message
[1:32:57] the way of a true preacher
[1:33:01] and I want to take my inspiration
[1:33:05] through a prophet's message
[1:33:08] God call man
[1:33:12] [Applause]
[1:33:19] the man that God called
[1:33:23] that's why the Bible says
[1:33:27] he'll put into the church
[1:33:31] it's not the church putting in somebody
[1:33:34] as a pastor
[1:33:37] the minutes the church get involved in
[1:33:41] choosing a man of God they've been wrong
[1:33:44] all the time
[1:33:47] as long as the Deacon board come
[1:33:49] together and they put a man in there it
[1:33:53] is altogether wrong
[1:33:55] the minute the disciples chose Barnabas
[1:34:00] and not Paul because the church chose
[1:34:03] Barnabas
[1:34:06] they were wrong
[1:34:12] We cannot put anybody in behind this
[1:34:16] holy desk
[1:34:20] because the Bible says
[1:34:23] and God
[1:34:25] put bring that scripture back in
[1:34:29] and he who's he
[1:34:33] he gave
[1:34:36] he gave
[1:34:37] [Music]
[1:34:37] [Applause]
[1:34:45] not today we get a club of people
[1:34:49] a Ministerial Association in the message
[1:34:53] where ministers feel that one we're not
[1:34:56] having fellowship with him and we kick
[1:34:59] him out and we'll keep this one and we
[1:35:01] have fellowship with this one but the
[1:35:03] one they kick out is the one that God
[1:35:06] chose
[1:35:06] [Applause]
[1:35:07] [Music]
[1:35:12] we want people here behind the secret
[1:35:16] desk of God that is actually called a
[1:35:20] God that knows God we do not want
[1:35:25] hand-picked guys behind the pulpit and
[1:35:29] after 40 years they give up the message
[1:35:33] and they say that brother Branham is a
[1:35:36] false prophet they are hand-picked amen
[1:35:39] but if God put him to the church
[1:35:42] [Applause]
[1:35:48] [Music]
[1:35:49] [Applause]
[1:35:54] you alone
[1:35:56] [Applause]
[1:35:56] [Music]
[1:36:00] [Applause]
[1:36:15] and therefore I want to read the quote
[1:36:18] God call man
[1:36:21] listen to the title of this message
[1:36:24] listen to the vocabulary
[1:36:27] of a true prophet
[1:36:30] listen to what the man of God says
[1:36:33] the men of God says God
[1:36:37] has called The Man
[1:36:44] it won't help me if I call that young
[1:36:47] man
[1:36:49] because it is called by a man
[1:36:51] and it won't work and it can't work it
[1:36:56] will flop it will come to nothing if I
[1:36:59] have called that young man but if God
[1:37:03] called that young man
[1:37:06] [Applause]
[1:37:15] then nobody can stop him
[1:37:20] you can rather stop the Sun but you
[1:37:23] won't stop that young man if God has
[1:37:26] called him a man come hell or high water
[1:37:30] that young man will stand Hallelujah
[1:37:33] because he was not called by a man he
[1:37:37] was called by God Amen
[1:37:46] God called man
[1:37:48] I like that God is calling the man
[1:37:51] [Music]
[1:37:58] God called man
[1:38:03] God
[1:38:05] called man
[1:38:08] Page Six
[1:38:10] he says God cannot send a Revival
[1:38:13] till he's got man shake you take it
[1:38:19] why don't we have Revival in the message
[1:38:21] take me wherever you want to there is no
[1:38:24] Revival take me to a church that's a
[1:38:27] life there is no church alive take me to
[1:38:31] a place in the message where you can
[1:38:33] feel the Holy Ghost move there is no
[1:38:35] place take me to a place where people is
[1:38:38] drunk under the spirit there is no place
[1:38:42] why we were taught right
[1:38:44] [Applause]
[1:39:04] foreign
[1:39:13] they don't even know what's the Holy
[1:39:15] Ghost they don't even know
[1:39:17] City
[1:39:20] amen they know nothing about a Heavenly
[1:39:23] language they know nothing about
[1:39:25] speaking in tongues they know nothing
[1:39:27] about being drunk in the spirit why
[1:39:30] they're not shaped for the Revival
[1:39:33] [Applause]
[1:39:39] we cannot
[1:39:42] we cannot have a Revival until we get
[1:39:44] men
[1:39:46] oh I hope this young man is
[1:39:49] a man
[1:39:51] that'll shake the lovers out of
[1:39:55] Port Elizabeth
[1:39:56] [Applause]
[1:40:04] a god-called man
[1:40:08] listen to what he says God trained man
[1:40:12] now somebody's got a train
[1:40:15] somebody's got to train this man
[1:40:19] now if you don't have a trainer how can
[1:40:22] you have a man
[1:40:23] so you need a trainer you'll need
[1:40:26] somebody that knows God that's got proof
[1:40:30] behind him every man he's got fruit amen
[1:40:34] go wherever he goes That's truth amen
[1:40:37] you need a man like that to train this
[1:40:41] young man to come up higher amen a
[1:40:46] god-strained man
[1:40:49] [Music]
[1:40:54] oh
[1:40:54] [Applause]
[1:41:01] God's winning man
[1:41:04] that's not trained up in the schools of
[1:41:06] theology

[1:41:53] [Applause]
[1:41:54] [Music]
[1:41:57] [Applause]
[1:42:13] when they preach it looks as if they
[1:42:15] swallowed in the whole Webster
[1:42:18] dictionary
[1:42:23] and there's no Revival
[1:42:26] there's nothing going on
[1:42:28] the people must take half an hour to
[1:42:32] actually work out what English word is
[1:42:35] used
[1:42:36] brother I don't have time for that I
[1:42:39] want some plain simple
[1:42:42] straightforward Gospel of Jesus Christ
[1:42:45] because the Bible says that the
[1:42:49] [Applause]
[1:42:53] that the simple heard Jesus
[1:42:57] [Applause]
[1:43:03] but you need old man
[1:43:05] that can train the young man
[1:43:08] now if the old man wasn't trained how is
[1:43:11] the young man going to be they gonna be
[1:43:14] twice as bad as the old man
[1:43:20] but give me an old man
[1:43:22] [Applause]
[1:43:24] that's been in the presence of God
[1:43:29] he can learn and teach the young man
[1:43:39] to be a
[1:43:41] god-called man
[1:43:43] [Applause]
[1:44:06] and he said further
[1:44:09] rugged Man of faith
[1:44:12] you don't have that rugged Man anymore
[1:44:15] because the man that that we have now in
[1:44:18] the message wants to be loved by
[1:44:20] everybody
[1:44:21] [Applause]
[1:44:23] and when you have a pastor that wants to
[1:44:25] be loved by everybody you got a
[1:44:28] compromise behind the death
[1:44:30] I don't want to be loved by everybody I
[1:44:34] want to be loved by God I want God's way
[1:44:38] to be my way every time Hallelujah I
[1:44:44] Wanna Be A Rocket Man
[1:44:47] [Applause]
[1:45:00] a rugged Man of faith
[1:45:03] that God has brought up in the school
[1:45:07] of his rugged training
[1:45:11] he must be hated
[1:45:14] and not loved by everybody
[1:45:16] [Applause]
[1:45:18] and still walk through that
[1:45:22] and say I shall not recant
[1:45:27] Luther will you re can I shall not
[1:45:31] regain rugged me
[1:45:34] Rocket Man

[2:00:41] the prophet said the quote says the
[2:00:44] Bible says it says all right to train
[2:00:46] them by the word
[2:00:50] is that the message
[2:00:52] is that what we hear
[2:00:54] the guy go to a concordance and he gets
[2:00:56] all the quotes
[2:00:57] on one word
[2:00:59] they come and read quotes he says it's
[2:01:02] not dead
[2:01:03] it's not the word it's not the quotes
[2:01:06] then what is it
[2:01:10] what did he says after that

[2:01:15] loving God

[2:01:58] school of the supernatural because
[2:02:01] brother Brown says they are trained by
[2:02:03] the word
[2:02:05] let's not do what he says but the letter
[2:02:07] killeth

[2:11:21] Shepherd that feeds them they don't have
[2:11:25] to go and get fed by anybody else
[2:11:27] [Applause]
[2:11:38] they will lack nothing
[2:11:41] the Sheep will be fed
[2:11:43] [Music]
[2:11:45] so we are not ordaining a gift
[2:11:49] I'm not gonna attain this young man
[2:11:52] because he's got a gift
[2:11:57] I'm not ordaining a gift
[2:12:01] we are daining
[2:12:03] fruit

[2:12:14] I had men that as a gift of preaching
[2:12:17] that your hair will raise after they
[2:12:20] preach
[2:12:22] but there's no Supernatural
[2:12:26] there's no souls coming in
[2:12:31] they got a gift
[2:12:33] but they don't have no fruit
[2:12:35] so I'm not ordaining

[2:14:23] Jesus Says by thy fruit you shall know
[2:14:25] them where did he get it from numbers
[2:14:29] chapter 17 verse 3.
[2:14:32] there's where Jesus got it from
[2:14:35] numbers
[2:14:37] 17.
[2:14:39] and he came to pass that on the marrow
[2:14:42] Moses went into the Tabernacle of

[2:49:39] just be honest you know there's no
[2:49:41] honest people in this message
[2:49:45] they're not honest
[2:49:47] ly

[2:51:06] now the preacher that kills is a
[2:51:08] preacher without the spirit

[2:51:13] end
[2:51:15] Spirit isn't moved
[2:51:19] by the word
[2:51:22] is false anointed ones
[2:51:26] and the word without
[2:51:29] the spirit is false anointed ones
[2:51:35] and
[2:51:38] the spirit
[2:51:42] and the word without the spirit is
[2:51:44] foolish virgin
[2:51:47] if the spirit isn't mixed with the word
[2:51:49] it kills
[2:51:51] the latter killeth by the spirit giveth
[2:51:53] life
[2:51:54] remember this young man
[2:51:56] never preach without the Holy Ghost
[2:51:59] it's the letter preacher that kills
[2:52:03] that preaching without the spirit kills
[2:52:06] why do you think the message right
[2:52:08] around the world is dead because we only
[2:52:10] gave them word all the time
[2:52:12] right in America all over they did why
[2:52:16] because there's no spirit
[2:52:19] it's in word word word word word
[2:52:22] man is a bunch of nonsense
[2:52:26] says it
[2:52:33] [Applause]
[2:52:34] it kills
[2:52:37] word preaching kills
[2:52:40] so a young man
[2:52:43] makes that word
[2:52:45] with a meal and the oil
[2:52:48] you'll have a cake coming
[2:52:53] it's a letter preacher that kills

[2:53:05] glorious time
[2:53:07] jubilating praising God
[2:53:10] even without the word
[2:53:13] they're more happier than what we are
[2:53:18] so when I'm in a message you know we're
[2:53:20] going to hold my message you know but
[2:53:22] just do it
[2:53:24] he's doing
[2:53:25] it

[2:53:59] the preaching that kills is a shapely
[2:54:02] and orderly and eloquent and fluent
[2:54:08] Place preaching and no spirit
[2:54:11] it kills more than
[2:54:15] error
