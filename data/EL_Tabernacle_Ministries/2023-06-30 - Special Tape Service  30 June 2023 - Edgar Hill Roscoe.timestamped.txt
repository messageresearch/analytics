[0:55] we glad to call you father
[1:00] thank you that we could
[1:03] gather her like this Lord
[1:08] and thank you for sending light
[1:13] it's good to find the way
[1:18] but oh God if the way hasn't got light
[1:23] then we'll get lost Lord
[1:27] you might walk over onto the sidewalk
[1:33] or we might trip over some cobblestones
[1:39] but thank you for the light that's on
[1:41] this way
[1:43] the pull off fire
[1:47] the Morning Star
[1:51] that could lead us through Lord
[1:55] we pray this morning as we
[1:59] come to eat of your hand
[2:03] Lord William
[2:06] we need you we need some more fuel
[2:13] to tip us up just to get out of here
[2:15] Lord
[2:18] therefore we ask of you God
[2:22] to come and help us here
[2:27] The Invasion is on
[2:32] people is opening up now
[2:36] to get baptized with the nicolaitan
[2:38] spirit
[2:42] there is also a bride that's opening up
[2:46] to be invaded
[2:49] from the astronaut of Heaven
[2:55] May invade us Lord
[3:01] we ask these Mercies
[3:06] not that we're Worthy
[3:10] but you're the worthy one
[3:12] this morning I give myself into your
[3:15] hand and report for service
[3:19] I give you my gift Lord
[3:22] may you take that gift and work with it
[3:27] pull me aside
[3:30] and use my gift
[3:33] I ask it in the name of Jesus Christ
[3:37] because what good is a gift
[3:40] if I can't get out of the way for you to
[3:42] lose that gift
[3:46] then we can say shine all around us by
[3:48] day and by night
[3:51] I hand this meeting into your hands
[3:55] may your undertake for us amen and amen
[3:59] if you have your Bibles with you
[4:09] Booker Daniel
[4:16] 9.
[4:22] 21 down to verse 24.
[4:30] you also was speaking in prayer
[4:35] while I was speaking
[4:37] in prayer
[4:41] even the man Gabriel whom I had seen in
[4:44] division
[4:47] at the beginning being caused to fly
[4:50] swiftly
[4:52] touch me about
[4:55] the time of the evening oblation right
[5:00] at the evening time he touched me
[5:04] while I was speaking in prayer
[5:07] Gabriel flew in
[5:10] while we speak
[5:13] about Daniel
[5:19] May Gabriel not drop down here
[5:23] because he can only announce
[5:28] what's going to take place
[5:32] but let Michael drop down here
[5:36] because he can transform and deliver
[5:45] we already had the announcement
[5:52] we already heard
[5:54] from Genesis 18 Elohim Michael Gabriel
[5:59] Gabriel already announced
[6:05] but we need Michael the angel
[6:13] to deliver us
[6:15] give us strength
[6:18] help us
[6:25] write about the evening time
[6:28] you while I was speaking in prayer I
[6:31] like that
[6:34] and he informed me and talked with me
[6:36] and said oh Daniel I am now come forth
[6:40] to give thee skill and understanding
[6:46] at the beginning of thy supplication the
[6:48] Commandments came forth and I come to
[6:50] show thee
[6:52] but Thou Art greatly beloved therefore
[6:54] understand the matter and
[6:57] and considered a vision
[7:04] it's quite something
[7:07] Daniel
[7:09] a Jew
[7:11] Joseph
[7:13] a jewel
[7:16] Gabriel said to them
[7:21] but Michael
[7:23] can go both ways
[7:26] Jill and Gentile
[7:35] Raphael
[7:37] the angel
[7:41] stand on the backside
[7:45] drop down
[7:48] through the anointing
[7:51] of the elders
[7:53] healed sister ghani
[8:03] they are here
[8:10] brother Branham calls him the angel of
[8:12] healing
[8:16] the one that stirs the water
[8:22] an ear drop in there
[8:26] and you get healed
[8:30] by that angel
[8:36] at the beginning of thy supplication at
[8:39] the beginning of your prayers
[8:41] when you're laid in front of me
[8:45] the Commandment came forth and I have
[8:47] come to show thee
[8:49] but Thou Art greatly beloved therefore
[8:52] understand the matter
[8:54] and consider the vision
[8:56] 70 weeks are determined upon thy people
[9:00] and upon thy Holy City
[9:04] to do what
[9:06] Point number one
[9:09] to finish transgression
[9:12] Point number two
[9:15] to make make an end of sins
[9:20] Point number three
[9:24] and to make reconciliation
[9:26] [Music]
[9:27] for iniquity
[9:30] Point number four
[9:33] and to bring in Everlasting
[9:35] righteousness
[9:37] Hallelujah
[9:42] Point number five
[9:45] and to seal up the vision and the
[9:47] prophecy
[9:50] Point number six
[9:53] and to anoint
[9:57] for the last time
[10:00] the most holy
[10:06] the six-fold purpose
[10:11] that's why I said
[10:13] you cannot preach purpose unless you
[10:16] preach a mind
[10:18] and when you preach mind you cannot have
[10:21] mind unless you have a prophet
[10:25] therefore the prophet could say six fold
[10:29] purpose
[10:32] and then he comes back in a seal book
[10:35] everything God has three fold purpose
[10:40] and he comes after the seal book and he
[10:44] preached the threefold purpose
[10:52] and they stealing the messages
[10:57] but that same message on purpose they
[11:00] preach they're going to stand in front
[11:02] of God and give an account what they've
[11:05] done with their message
[11:11] brother Branham
[11:25] reaches
[11:27] and the gold mines and the diamond mines
[11:30] of South Africa
[11:33] he means more to us
[11:36] than anything else
[11:39] so we thank him and we praise him
[11:43] what a wonderful savior is he don't you
[11:47] love him this morning
[12:02] now it's been preached
[12:06] The Invasion
[12:08] it has come into the newspaper
[12:11] and that's
[12:15] a rock
[12:18] newspaper
[12:23] and
[12:25] brother Branham says this if a man
[12:28] preaches
[12:30] and God comes behind it like that then
[12:34] it was not the man it was God
[12:38] [Music]
[12:39] [Applause]
[12:49] so
[12:52] we must have heard the voice of God
[12:58] in this couple of months that has
[13:00] elapsed
[13:02] now I can only come and fulfill my
[13:04] purpose
[13:07] and fulfill what God sent me to do
[13:12] and
[13:14] I cannot vouch for anybody else
[13:17] but
[13:19] even if I try to do something else I
[13:22] can't
[13:25] because every man of God is in prison
[13:29] like Paul being a prisoner of Christ
[13:33] we can only do what God has ordained us
[13:36] to do on this mother earth
[13:39] nothing more nothing less
[13:42] and we want to finish the course we one
[13:45] till
[13:47] to get to the bottom
[13:52] and that we could turn around and say we
[13:54] didn't shun to declare all the Praises
[13:57] of God
[13:58] all the councils of God
[14:02] before we leave this world behind
[14:06] and it's so very soon that we're going
[14:08] to go home
[14:12] and we're going to do everything in our
[14:14] power
[14:17] and you see how God is Healing The Sick
[14:22] we had another and announce of last week
[14:26] and Saturday
[14:27] the young sister fullness and told us in
[14:30] Cape Town how
[14:31] are the people is getting healed and I
[14:34] what I'd done was after we had the
[14:36] prayer line I came behind I says now
[14:38] some of you still have the pain and you
[14:40] still feel sick and all that
[14:42] I said but after a while the Holy Ghost
[14:45] will visit you one by one by your house
[14:47] I said the I said the angel of the Lord
[14:50] will visit you one by one at your homes
[14:53] and uh for this last three weeks
[14:58] the testimonies are coming in
[15:01] and last week and Saturday nights sister
[15:04] back at home when we just came back from
[15:07] the um
[15:09] uh uh combined or was it Sunday one of
[15:12] the two days but it was just after we
[15:15] made that announcement and then she told
[15:17] my wife please tell brother roscom
[15:21] that we stole getting in
[15:23] testimonies
[15:26] of the healing power of almighty God
[15:35] psalm
[15:37] very sure something going on
[15:41] we're not just coming to church and sit
[15:43] around
[15:45] the Supernatural is all around you
[15:51] and you supposed to be in desperation
[15:57] amen
[15:59] and um
[16:01] Shiva spoke about the message says even
[16:04] I a lot of churches outside is buying
[16:08] the message that I preached down there
[16:10] pain
[16:12] and um
[16:15] we really glad for what God is doing
[16:19] no I had quite a few invitations
[16:24] to go out this year
[16:27] but as we see such a lot of things are
[16:30] happening I don't feel
[16:32] really or maybe if God speaks to my
[16:37] heart I might move but
[16:39] as far as my mind is concerned because
[16:43] my heart can only do what my mind says
[16:51] and
[16:52] uh as far as my mind is concerned I'd
[16:55] like to stay around
[16:57] and just see a couple of months left and
[17:01] get behind me
[17:02] so I can feel okay
[17:04] because
[17:05] [Music]
[17:06] um
[17:08] everything
[17:09] is ready
[17:11] everything is
[17:16] planned and purpose
[17:20] and on the verge
[17:23] of breaking forth
[17:26] so we really thank God
[17:30] that we posted
[17:33] my concern goes a lot to the young
[17:35] people
[17:38] I am concerned about him
[17:42] and I want you to get the Holy Ghost
[17:46] because if you're not going to get the
[17:48] Seal of God
[17:51] you are not going to stand
[17:56] repentance is all right
[17:59] it's good to repent every day
[18:04] please
[18:06] but the conversion is the thing
[18:09] the Holy Ghost is the thing
[18:13] it's good to be baptized
[18:17] but friends
[18:19] you can be saved and yet not converted
[18:23] and conversion only comes by a baptism
[18:31] so we pray that God
[18:36] would invade you as brother Lenny or
[18:39] Somebody Prayed
[18:44] with the Holy Ghost
[18:46] then I'll feel good
[18:49] then you can go to as many sessions you
[18:52] want to go
[18:54] you can smoke as many cigarettes you
[18:56] want to smoke
[18:59] you can go with any wealthy friend as
[19:02] much as you want to go
[19:06] I feel safe
[19:09] because you're gonna run away there the
[19:11] Holy Ghost is not going to keep you in
[19:13] one of those places
[19:23] so before visiting those places and
[19:25] having a worldly friend
[19:27] get the Holy Ghost
[19:30] and once you have the Holy Ghost
[19:35] then you can do what you want to do
[19:39] all that I know that you seal till the
[19:41] day of your Redemption
[19:45] so my work here
[19:48] is to give you the Holy Ghost
[19:55] God can't do anything in the interval
[20:00] unless he sealed the 144.
[20:04] with the same baptism
[20:07] that's here
[20:13] now I'm glad that God
[20:18] has
[20:19] given me
[20:22] one thing in this life
[20:25] to give out
[20:27] the baptism of the Holy Ghost I'm
[20:30] satisfied
[20:40] and when the young people has the
[20:42] baptism of the Holy Ghost
[20:45] then you can touch one another
[20:52] I want to see if you will be able to
[20:59] go like
[21:05] because the Holy Ghost is a counter
[21:10] it can't smoke it can't drink
[21:15] [Applause]
[21:28] it can't touch a woman it can't touch a
[21:32] man it's a counter can't look at
[21:35] television
[21:42] that's the reason the people fear it
[21:47] can't put the see-through blouse on
[21:50] can't put a short dress on
[21:54] can't have bob hair cut hair
[22:04] but I like the sconther
[22:09] amen
[22:10] so let's get the Holy Ghost
[22:14] a lot of things are going on
[22:18] a lot of things
[22:21] is going past
[22:25] many people
[22:28] but God
[22:31] has been good to us
[22:34] their eyes is open
[22:38] about a year and a half ago
[22:41] we preached
[22:45] when money fails
[22:51] many thought it was just a good message
[22:53] many thought it was just
[22:56] a time to pass by in the Church of God
[23:00] but it was prophecy
[23:04] we told you when you start seeing things
[23:06] like that look up your Redemption is
[23:09] drawing now
[23:14] and those other things that we're
[23:16] watching because brother Branham told us
[23:18] to watch it
[23:21] those are the things that we underline
[23:23] because brother Branham says underline
[23:25] it
[23:26] [Music]
[23:29] and
[23:31] just a couple of weeks ago
[23:38] in Time Magazine
[23:41] how low can it go
[23:46] how low is the dollar
[23:50] and I told you when I preached
[23:55] and I came back from the states last
[23:57] year and I told you about the book there
[24:00] economical earthquake that this guy said
[24:03] that you would only going to America is
[24:06] only going to have two years
[24:09] and it's not even two years yet
[24:13] and she's plunging
[24:16] and when she goes
[24:19] money fails right around the world
[24:26] I looked at how the Jesuits worked out
[24:28] the whole thing
[24:32] what has the dollar got to do with the
[24:34] Yen and with her Benchmark and with the
[24:37] Rand and with the power what what I mean
[24:39] what
[24:41] but it shows you there's power behind
[24:45] the monetary system
[24:48] and the German's money is one of the
[24:50] strongest in Durham Japanese yen is the
[24:53] strongest
[24:56] but they say if this still goes down
[24:59] further
[25:01] than they
[25:04] their money that's so strong will have
[25:06] to go down as well
[25:11] when the dollar goes the whole world
[25:13] goes
[25:15] for each two years ago this day
[25:19] the scripture
[25:22] of Genesis is fulfilled in front of your
[25:26] very eyes
[25:27] [Applause]
[25:36] where Joseph says
[25:39] in Genesis and money fails
[25:43] now when money fails
[25:46] then also on the other side
[25:50] the perfect man is just about to be
[25:52] birthed
[25:56] [Applause]
[26:01] and when the perfect man gets birth
[26:05] then Perfection hits the pyramid
[26:10] then they
[26:13] cannot be made perfect unless we hit
[26:16] perfection
[26:18] then our Perfection
[26:20] raises the Dead
[26:23] 30 40 days of Revival
[26:27] in the sixth time mention
[26:32] where no eye natural eye sees it
[26:37] but our eyes because we'll see our loved
[26:42] ones
[26:43] 30 40 days Revival
[26:49] then we'll fly away in the morning
[26:53] then the interval breaks
[26:55] [Applause]
[26:58] praise God
[27:03] our ministry is not like the other
[27:06] Ministries
[27:07] this is something different here
[27:12] we don't want to say that but it's the
[27:14] truth
[27:17] Suleiman we took her out last night and
[27:20] she said something that really shook my
[27:22] wife and myself
[27:23] and I won't mention
[27:26] some of the sisters that she mentioned
[27:28] and down in Cape Town whenever I go down
[27:30] there
[27:32] and they said man we don't want to
[27:35] listen to anybody but when brother
[27:36] Roscoe come we want to be there because
[27:38] we're going to get something
[27:41] and she turned around she says yeah I
[27:43] just wish that you don't put too much
[27:45] emphasis on the man
[27:47] to let the man fall
[27:49] because we realize that God gave that
[27:52] man something
[27:55] but the tower is too late for any
[27:58] falling
[27:59] it can only be a rapture
[28:01] [Applause]
[28:13] so Wednesday night
[28:17] we're gonna play again when money fails
[28:20] to you
[28:23] bring your mind into rapturing faith
[28:26] and if I catch your mind
[28:29] I don't care about the perfect man
[28:32] character
[28:34] forget you here I've got you
[28:42] all the other things will be added then
[28:54] this alone was a message I Can Say
[28:56] Goodbye
[29:00] [Music]
[29:06] but
[29:09] we still have until six o'clock tonight
[29:12] [Applause]
[29:24] I'm so happy
[29:26] we'll walk in the light
[29:29] oh such a beautiful life
[29:34] what a beautiful light
[29:37] I want to do everything to stay in this
[29:40] light
[29:46] amen
[29:49] so may God just take the gift this
[29:52] morning and do whatever he wants to do
[29:55] with the gift
[29:57] pull the gift this way pull it that way
[30:00] Lord I'm reporting for service
[30:06] each one of us has a gift
[30:14] amen
[30:17] so I'm not gonna put my gift in a ground
[30:21] there but nobody know about it
[30:24] and when
[30:26] the Harvest man comes back
[30:29] I want to know what I've done with my
[30:31] gift
[30:33] the Lord I have buried it no
[30:37] when he comes back
[30:41] I want to produce much fruit amen
[30:46] brother Brahm says if a church don't
[30:50] grow spiritually and naturally within
[30:54] three years or a Ministry don't produce
[30:58] naturally and spiritually in three years
[31:01] God is not with administering
[31:15] so we'll walk in the light
[31:19] amen it's a beautiful light
[31:23] praise God
[31:26] and the last thing I would like to say
[31:28] is um
[31:31] we're waiting for the cutout from
[31:34] Brother Stafford
[31:36] about a certain rock group that's here
[31:39] and they telling the guy not to leave in
[31:42] the interval
[31:46] don't live in the interval
[31:49] now I want to tell you
[31:52] don't you want to try and live in the
[31:54] interval
[31:56] because it's only the foolish virgins
[31:58] that lives in the interval
[32:00] [Music]
[32:03] [Applause]
[32:05] so this message is also in the newspaper
[32:09] saying something don't live in the
[32:13] interval
[32:18] now all these things
[32:21] how can the mind take it
[32:28] It could only be God that's all
[32:36] that's what I would like to bring to
[32:37] your mind
[32:38] to do it to do with God
[32:42] and nothing else amen

[33:32] but this time he's too late
[33:35] [Applause]

[33:42] [Applause]
[33:44] amen said brother Oscar got a problem
[33:48] here I got a problem there amen I don't
[33:50] know if I got the Holy Ghost because I
[33:52] do this wrong and do that wrong that's
[33:55] nothing that's just a leak
[33:58] you're just losing a little Holy Ghost
[34:00] but you've got a Holy Ghost
