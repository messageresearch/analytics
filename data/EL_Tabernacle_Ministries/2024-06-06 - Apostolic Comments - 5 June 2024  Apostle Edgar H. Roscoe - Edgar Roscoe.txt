TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Applause] [Music] [Applause] hallu I think I'm uh more in the pit than anywhere else I don't think there's a pastor that's uh so much in the poopit like uh I am that's why I read that quotation scripture where Paul says I labored more than them all and um I can't stop laboring I'm a workaholic Hallelujah I like my [Applause] job you may be seated amen I am I said I'm going to come this Wednesday to make this clip um about the quotation that brother Sol renica gave us and gave me um that he said he's got the quote where brother Brenham said um you receive the Holy Ghost without emotions and although I told him there is no quote because since 1979 I was was nailing this thing down and if and I call it the Cod and if had a quot you would have blasted me if Gideon had the quot you would have blasted me Beckett had a quote and the whole world went after that quote somewhere in the world would have blasted me and put that quote up and I told him there is no quote like that and then he made a mistake to say that no no received the Holy Ghost without Sensations I said there only one it says this is a Time page 32 and if it's that quote you don't send it to me I got the quote I say you don't have the quote you know so for all these years I've been nailing the thing down and I was shocked that he said he's got a quote and that's why I said I'll give you two weeks and one Wednesday I will come and say whether there is a court like that or whether there is not a court like that and I ask all the the brainy guys you know in in U in elano you know the engineers and uh and and and and the guys with the diplomas from the University you see I come from u a spiritual University and um we gave it two weeks from two we Wednesday when I had a confrontation with him and they've been searching and I asked a few pastors and they told me we're not even going to look because there's nothing like that you know so they just switched me off uh immediately we're not going to waste our time you know there's nothing like that so um finally today is two weeks is up and none of the brainy guys the university guys could find a quote like that so there is no quote like that and another clever guy in the message with us you know that guy very clever in school he came first most of the time you know and he also went through University and he says uh Pastor uh I also looked but I can't find it I said well then I was right for all this years since 1979 so s REO was lying again he lied playing down he lied and you can see that hits of uh the combine I think it's going to 8,000 now and you know you got to times that by bang bang bang because most of them don't listen to it alone so are we near the time that we take it off because we take it off if the hits is above six then we take it off because then we know know the whole world has heard it so um I think the whole world has heard it and I think they're going to sit him flat on that one and also I can understand now why he sits at Will's church because he never danced in his life he never woried he never shouted he never jumped in his life I never seen him do that here I never saw him do it at Raymond's I never saw him do it in tukum serus the only thing he done was to to go against the pits went against my pit went against Raymond's pit went against tok's pit and then also if he feels that uh a minister cannot tell him anything then he leaves and he going sits in the car my wife used to get a fit for that thing and out in tukum I believe Georgie also done the same thing now who the heck are they and they know nothing sir I have never given a guy a hiding a spanking like I gave Sol renica [Music] he came the worst of of them all and he had to start lying you know when you when you get a guy in a corner he's either going to admit or he's going to lie to get out of the corner and I hope that Raymond Thompson told him that he never bought the tape and Ne neither the tape recorders you see the thing that God gave me in Revelations 10:8 nobody had it to think that this Mighty God kept this thing a secret he kept his mouth closed and then he revealed it after he broke it he revealed it to the prophet Revelations 10:7 then nobody saw anything it was on white granite rock then 2023 he says now come on Edgar check that rock and it's still bursting I don't have any time that angel keep me busy telling you I'm busy some sometimes was awake I'm you know I am awake between 2: and 4: in the morning since a young man and I'm an old man I still wake up that time amen you know I sometimes ask mhari to to phone me when I have to get up early and then uh the time she phone I already had a shower I already dressed I'm starting to make myself coffee you know but just in case my age you know will let me that day sleep a little late but it hasn't happened yet so I never disappointed you in praying for you between 2: and 4: in the morning I pray for El tle I never fail and now now now that's all the grace of God it's not me it's God Amen so um he tried to stop it you know and you you'll hear uh the end of the month sir I just finished the messages I got messages until August it's laying it's finished and the end of the month one you'll hear me say there and show you uh when the lion roars who can but prophesy he doesn't say the prophets prophesy he says the who Edgar Osco will hear the Roar of the Lion you watch the end of the month or we're going to preach on that and I'm going to have a prayer line the end of the month he told me to with that message I must have a prayer line so the end of the month we're going to have a prayer line it's going to be announced you know so he says who can stop them after the lon law nobody can stop me not even Sol Rica am man he's nothing he never can you know he thought he stopped me with a split but here I am I'm better of than when he was here he thought he'll stop me at sao's funeral when he walked up out him and his wife as I walked towards the podium he walked out he thought he was going to stop me and I laughed Within Myself he said said that you know I left because I couldn't see the seven Thunders being the Seven Virtues but El Li he Li he walked out by Raymond maybe not believing the seven Thunders seven verges but he didn't leave Raymond chased him away and one of the brothers was in the church and he was hardly in his car and that brother phoned me to say hey man Raymond chase this guy away like a dog I said but how did he look he says the only way I can describe it is a dog with his tail between his legs that's how Sol can walk out of Raymond's church then Raymond looked and he saw this brother in my church sitting there then he says I don't even care if you're going to tell Edgar Rosco because I'm not Edgar Rosco s and you people that sitting here that that that that likes him someone walk out with him that's how he chased Sol away and then I I asked the brothers then who got up and walked out with him he says nobody not not I didn't see anybody walk out with him he walked out alone the professor now the professor is going to be taught by little boys in the message is going to finish him now you don't come up against anointed of God so that I needed to tell the church because I said tonight I am going to and um we couldn't find the tape the the quot and you that's going to listen to me on this clip right around the world as you all are listening to me anyhow you know yeah it's quite something man you all know Sol R Canal so he's not that guy that he keeps himself you know even I was waiting for Jonathan to be born for 2 years you know and after 2 years she only fell pregnant and uh I read the book of Jude and I was really impressed with the with the book of Jude because it's the book before Revelations so I said if I get a boy I'm going to name his name Jude and Jonathan came and he was a boy and I was going to call his named Jude and so Reno went to my mother-in-law and said Jude means Judas and my mother-in-law came up against me and says you're not going to name your son Jude and that's why we changed judee's uh Jonathan's name uh from Jude to Jonathan because of Sol renica and then what happened was uh I looked at this guy and says man Edgar rosu don't get stopped I said if I get the next boy nobody but is going to stop itall I'm a hell of a station masterj when Jude got born I said welcome home Jude nobody stopped me now Jude does mean the other word is Judas but the main word for Jude is Judah the line of the tribe of Judah and here that lion is roaring of Judah in E Tabernacle and S can't take it can't stop a man of God even mingled in my family [Applause] so I am what I am and I'm so sure I mean Daniel played me a club 198 to solica says I trust Edgar Rosa with My Soul it's right on tape but he never did he's a great Pretender that's all that he is he pretends so I thought that I was finished with Joe Daniels and this so I asked God I said Lord now I got two 2 hours in the morning to talk to God and I said Lord why every time I must do a thing like this so he says no this guy was hiding and he was the main culprit he say so he also has to be exposed I'm going to close with this he said to me he said yeah you straighten out everybody I said yeah I did straighten them out he says but nobody left the churches they still believe what they believe I said well I didn't expect them to come I said when after brother brandham straightened out everybody who came 300 of them were supposed to be baptized they never came I said Jesus Christ straightened out everybody yes sir and nobody came yes sir I said but one thing I'm going to tell you brother s they all worried after they heard they must get the Holy Ghost with emotions and they didn't get it that way they are worried because they don't have the token then and if they don't have the token they are none of Christ and they cannot make it and the Death Angel will take them if they don't have now how did you like Sunday when I brought out the mystery of the Holy Ghost without emotions right in the Bible that mystery was only revealed in E Tabernacle you can shout louder than that man [Applause] [Music] [Applause] amen so that mystery is also made known because we got the Holy Ghost we got it and we're giving it out we don't only talk about it people experience it they get drunk they can chuck on the floor they scream you remember that meeting when nearly everybody in the church spoke in tongues you remember WR with the Bible WR with a quote right with the spirit how can we be wrong Hallelujah you ought to give yourself a hand clap for accepting this poopit amen yes my sister amen I say the same thing amen God don't make no mistakes amen okay there's another thing I would like to talk to you about can I ask you what happened in Durban what happened in PE yes sir yes sir they said it was a Tado yes sir do you see how it looked floods all over the world some places droughts yes sir and I told you after cover yes sir what's going to follow yes sir Hallelujah did I prophesy that Hallelujah we can play the tape for [Applause] you right in covert we said next to follow this thing climate change amen yes sir and before coming to service sister stelle before I came here tonight I look at the news and the general of the UN was warning the world he says 5 years ago we warned the world about the climate change he says it's now so bad we can't make a plan tomorrow we have to make a plan today day otherwise the planet is gone go look at the news tonight why is there floods and such a lot of water all over because the ice is melting and the oceans is getting full and the sun is actually sucking up more water and dumping it all over what is that brother Osco that is Romans the Earth is groaning yes [Applause] sir hallah the G10 he says None of the G10 countries has done anything about it for the last 5 years he says it's worth worse than it was ever before and he says I beg of you in other words let us cut out fossil fuel and coal now where is the world going to cut out petrol there's where their money lays money is going to destroy this world don't worry about money's people let us push the gospel you're going to lose it anyhow you're going to lose it anyhow amen you're going to lose it anyhow so let's push the gospel and maybe get in that last one Hallelujah it might be brother BR it might be a black one so I'm looking in in in in South Africa so I'm building churches in in South Africa and not Europe and America in Africa because it might be a black [Applause] one Hallelujah that's why I was in mopani did you see how mopani look on Sunday did you see how mapani look on Sunday it looked like a Revival and the Holy Ghost
