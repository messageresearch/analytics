[0:01] and I'd like to entitle this message
[0:03] moving into Thanksgiving
[0:06] and Jubilee
[0:10] [Applause]
[0:14] there was nobody
[0:17] that could tell me
[0:19] that they didn't know that Jesus is
[0:22] passing through
[0:23] [Applause]
[0:27] his reputation went before him
[0:30] [Applause]
[0:33] and they knew he was coming through
[0:36] Samaria
[0:40] [Applause]
[0:41] but they didn't
[0:44] go out to meet him
[0:49] was just like Jacob
[0:51] Jacob says I knew that God was here
[0:56] but I knew it not
[0:57] [Music]
[1:00] I saw the Angels walking up and down the
[1:03] ladder
[1:04] [Music]
[1:07] I know that's gone
[1:11] and once you know it's gone
[1:13] you will always know it's wrong
[1:17] and what do you do when you know he's
[1:19] passing through
[1:21] you know what you're gonna do
[1:23] [Applause]
[1:25] ah come on
[1:26] I say for pay your thumb
[1:28] [Applause]
[1:30] I say forbade your time
[1:37] El Tabernacle
[1:39] around
[1:41] [Applause]
[1:43] foreign
[1:45] [Applause]
