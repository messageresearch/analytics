want to take this opportunity brother every sister friend family Associates that um took time off to be here today we're so glad that we could take a piece of your life to be with us and I hope that we would not waste your time I do not believe that the man should go to church just to consume time just because you've got nothing to do and you feel religious and you're going to waste your time then you get nothing I believe we come to church come through the doors when you leave when you leave you should feel a difference I do not have much more time on this Earth since the time 1951 when brother Branham lady's head ladies hands on this here I'm the only I'm the only preacher in South Africa that brother Branham laid his hands on [Applause] 1951. [Applause] and I've been here for 57 years I've established churches in every province in South Africa [Music] I wasted no time and most of the ministers come from yeah [Applause] most of them brother twine amend them all come from yeah we started it and we're going on so long as I got breath in mind nostrils I'm gonna push it amen so may God bless you we thank God for the mayor and our precious Pastor there we thank God that they could take off time of their busy schedule to be with us we do not feel Worthy but we do appreciate it so without any ado I like to bail into what I want to do today if you have your weapons with you As You Are the children of God we are going to turn our Bibles to familiar scripture that actually coincide with the happenings today we have come from Johannesburg to ordain a young man We Believe the fire of God is in his soul that has chosen straight and another way I don't easily ordained any person for my 57 years you can count them on one hand I first want to see fruit before I ordain anybody and I saw this young man didn't go to other churches to pull people away from another fall and he went into the streets today we're both churches from other churches we can't then we split the church to start a church but you can take your head off for a man that comes start a church without anybody outside the brothers we think I hear you that you made it God bless you if I can draw your attention to the book of Ephesians as the scholars name this book as the best writings of the first messenger in it it dovetails and parallels the Book of Joshua and Joshua is the baptism of the Holy Ghost Ephesians 4 11 you know the scripture but let us read it and he gave listen how it starts and he gave some not everybody although you can kick under Every Little Bush you kick a pasta out but the Bible said there's only some [Applause] [Music] it's not every football player that is a messy or a Ronaldo they all play football but there's one run out and there's one message so the Bible picks out of all of them some thank you some apostles don't stop there and some evangelists it's like a million not everybody can be a mayor but some that's why you can't help but take ministers and weigh them out you weigh them up why because some [Applause] the rest is not only there to fill up the Gap but they are not in the Sun [Music] some Prophets yes out of all the guys that say the prophets there's only some that's a real Prophets evangelists somebody told me brother Roscoe you'll never talk about evangelism evangelists I said now first bring me the guy that burns up the whole city and then I'll call him the evangelist if he didn't bring It One Soul then he is but only evangelist by name but evangelist pulls up to church [Applause] that's why you only have some that bring in Souls I had ministers for 40 years great preachers educational preachers but they didn't bring one Soul into El Tabernacle not one they call themselves evangelists but the work of the evangelists is not there some pastors to some of them not all of them some of them is 40 years here they've done nothing and now they leave the message where do they fall in they fall into some you cannot just join a church you're going to know why you're sitting in a church [Applause] and what will these five guys do they perfect the Saints and the minister in the church they would uplift and to edify the church they'll do anything [Applause] let us pray I think I'll really preach I'm not going to be able to finish this message father Jesus king God Jesus king of God we bow our heads before thee and oh God we're incapable to handle this meeting but father to fulfill all righteousness to not shun to declare all the councils we will stand in the gap and do thy will may you bless the reading of your word and oh God hide me behind the cross so the people don't see the scum that stands here but let they see the man that can cleanse the leper [Music] [Applause] I asked in Jesus name you maybe say that I'm sorry that you had to stand so long but if we Sing the anthem of South Africa then we stand the springboks are playing today and you're going to see they stand to the anthem of the hand on their heart and if we read the word of God this is the anthem of Heaven we stand to the word of God Amen if I should take a title out of there the way of a true preacher I'm going to ordain a preacher and that's why I'm titling this message the way of a true preacher and I want to take my inspiration through a prophet's message God call man [Applause] the man that God called that's why the Bible says he'll put into the church it's not the church putting in somebody as a pastor the minutes the church get involved in choosing a man of God they've been wrong all the time as long as the Deacon board come together and they put a man in there it is altogether wrong the minute the disciples chose Barnabas and not Paul because the church chose Barnabas they were wrong We cannot put anybody in behind this holy desk because the Bible says and God put bring that scripture back in and he who's he he gave he gave [Music] [Applause] not today we get a club of people a Ministerial Association in the message where ministers feel that one we're not having fellowship with him and we kick him out and we'll keep this one and we have fellowship with this one but the one they kick out is the one that God chose [Applause] [Music] we want people here behind the secret desk of God that is actually called a God that knows God we do not want hand-picked guys behind the pulpit and after 40 years they give up the message and they say that brother Branham is a false prophet they are hand-picked amen but if God put him to the church [Applause] [Music] [Applause] you alone [Applause] [Music] [Applause] and therefore I want to read the quote God call man listen to the title of this message listen to the vocabulary of a true prophet listen to what the man of God says the men of God says God has called The Man it won't help me if I call that young man because it is called by a man and it won't work and it can't work it will flop it will come to nothing if I have called that young man but if God called that young man [Applause] then nobody can stop him you can rather stop the Sun but you won't stop that young man if God has called him a man come hell or high water that young man will stand Hallelujah because he was not called by a man he was called by God Amen God called man I like that God is calling the man [Music] God called man God called man Page Six he says God cannot send a Revival till he's got man shake you take it why don't we have Revival in the message take me wherever you want to there is no Revival take me to a church that's a life there is no church alive take me to a place in the message where you can feel the Holy Ghost move there is no place take me to a place where people is drunk under the spirit there is no place why we were taught right [Applause] foreign they don't even know what's the Holy Ghost they don't even know City amen they know nothing about a Heavenly language they know nothing about speaking in tongues they know nothing about being drunk in the spirit why they're not shaped for the Revival [Applause] we cannot we cannot have a Revival until we get men oh I hope this young man is a man that'll shake the lovers out of Port Elizabeth [Applause] a god-called man listen to what he says God trained man now somebody's got a train somebody's got to train this man now if you don't have a trainer how can you have a man so you need a trainer you'll need somebody that knows God that's got proof behind him every man he's got fruit amen go wherever he goes That's truth amen you need a man like that to train this young man to come up higher amen a god-strained man [Music] oh [Applause] God's winning man that's not trained up in the schools of theology and of Education they preached today as if Oxford and Webster dictionary is her uncle and no Revival because they were trained in this in the school of theology come from the Bible School come from that school come from that school amen but they don't come from the train school where God trained his men [Applause] [Music] [Applause] when they preach it looks as if they swallowed in the whole Webster dictionary and there's no Revival there's nothing going on the people must take half an hour to actually work out what English word is used brother I don't have time for that I want some plain simple straightforward Gospel of Jesus Christ because the Bible says that the [Applause] that the simple heard Jesus [Applause] but you need old man that can train the young man now if the old man wasn't trained how is the young man going to be they gonna be twice as bad as the old man but give me an old man [Applause] that's been in the presence of God he can learn and teach the young man to be a god-called man [Applause] and he said further rugged Man of faith you don't have that rugged Man anymore because the man that that we have now in the message wants to be loved by everybody [Applause] and when you have a pastor that wants to be loved by everybody you got a compromise behind the death I don't want to be loved by everybody I want to be loved by God I want God's way to be my way every time Hallelujah I Wanna Be A Rocket Man [Applause] a rugged Man of faith that God has brought up in the school of his rugged training he must be hated and not loved by everybody [Applause] and still walk through that and say I shall not recant Luther will you re can I shall not regain rugged me Rocket Man that will stand [Applause] Amen on the word of God Amen [Applause] thank you [Applause] yes Rocket Man [Applause] [Music] foreign [Applause] [Music] [Applause] don't see what I see I am not going to compromise with them I would rather not have them as my friends because this year is my friend [Applause] and he goes on and it says men who are not afraid to face the fire [Music] Shadrick and Magic and have an eagle we're heating up the fire for you you have to repaint and regret what you are standing for okay even if you heat it upwards 20 times we are not going to bow young man regardless of how the fires burn against you we gotta saw water the fire is heated and heated and heat it you have to turn around and say beat it even more but we won't bow down to what you think I'm a rugged man I'll play I walk into the fire [Applause] they too scared to walk into the fire they do scared to take a trial they do scared when people actually come up against them but God wants rocket man that will walk right through all that criticism and say we won't repent [Applause] foreign [Music] [Applause] God call man they walk through the fire and I thank God I hope that when this young man walk into the fire maybe his friends don't like the stand he took maybe the church in Port Elizabeth don't like it but he's prepared to walk into the fire and he would have never met the thought man he would have never met the thought of man unless he was prepared to walk in the fire the fourth man waited for him in the fire and the fourth man is walking again that thought man is walking again the postman is walking again the boss man is walking again through the fire through the storm through the smoke and through the Heat [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] foreign this is harmony how many did we how many did he throw into this fire I I I thought it was it was three that we thought through into this fire he said but there's four and the Fourth Man and the thought man and glory to God the Batman The Postman in the fire look like the Son of God Amen [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] thank you [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] and if each one of you walk into your fiery trials walk on you'll be the fourth man [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] El Tabernacle Nebuchadnezzar the king the pastor of Babylon couldn't believe it he says bring them here bring them out of the fire and you know the dangerous part of it all [Music] the guys that threw them in the fire they died and if your pastor never taught you about the fire don't come near the fire you'll burn out you'll die and he brought them out and they stood in front of the king and the Bible says and the Bible says and the Bible says they took them and they smelled them and the Bible says and the Bible says they never ever smell like smoke not even smoke could get onto their garments and now because I said they don't even smell like smoke what smoke they never fell and smell like compromise or no compromising no smoke [Applause] no lovey-dovey with somebody that don't believe like them if you do that then you're smelling like smoke [Applause] rocket man who has come into the presence of God I know his power now if you don't have the Holy Ghost when did you come into the presence of God when the guys finish preach the church is dead dead there's no movement of the Holy Ghost there's nobody that's drunk they're making a mistake they think clamping hands and and shouting that's the Holy Ghost no that's the worship of the Holy Ghost but the Holy Ghost is speaking in tongues amen that is the Holy Ghost and dancing in the spirit [Applause] [Music] all right [Applause] now listen what he says men who are not afraid to face the fire men who come into the presence of God and knows his power they know the power two weeks ago or one week ago men stood up in the pulpit and said medicals count your money [Applause] oh you're there [Applause] [Music] when last do they see a miracle in this message two weeks ago a sister that had cancer Jonathan myself winnegan prayed for the doctor says it's all over and I mentioned count your Miracles one two three four I can hardly count them the Holy Ghost swept over the horse she got up to accept my miracle Monday she went to the doctors the doctors checked her he says you've got nothing there's no there's no cancer here no church can fly outside of the supernatural [Applause] [Music] count your miracles [Applause] a sister that couldn't fall pregnant right when the Miracles was going and the fourth man was walking and the fourth man was walking and she says Lord I claim the miracle I want to be pregnant and that Tuesday she went to the gynecologist said no Michael that's a near God amen you Franklin and Hallelujah count your Miracles it will surprise you because I know the supernatural [Applause] not only coming to church there must be Supernatural signs [Applause] [Music] some man that knows the Living God it's all right listen to what he says it's all right to be trained to train them by the word the prophet said the prophet said the quote says the Bible says it says all right to train them by the word is that the message is that what we hear the guy go to a concordance and he gets all the quotes on one word they come and read quotes he says it's not dead it's not the word it's not the quotes then what is it what did he says after that amen someone that's trying to know the loving God it's all right to train them by the word we're throwing them by the word all the years but we made a mistake it says spirit and then truth parrot and then the quotes [Applause] I don't listen to any guy that come into the pulpit I'll walk out I know he knows nothing he wasn't doing properly he didn't come through the school of the supernatural because brother Brown says they are trained by the word let's not do what he says but the letter killeth the more word you put in your church the more you kill the people you gave them so much word until now they don't believe the word get the spirit to get into the word that Dynamics to the mechanics then you'll see something moved [Applause] [Music] [Applause] you know this is only my introduction all right [Applause] I'd like to put this one down and a teaching for this young man First Kings 18 20. now therefore sinned and gathered to me all Israel unto Mount Carmel the Elijah Ministry our ministry gather them around the pyramid Mountain and the prophet saw bar 450. and the prophets of groves 400. of them so it's 850 right 850. preachers [Music] and Elijah said Gather them gather them bring them what does an expert say the last which 850 preachers eating at Jezebel's table that means she supported her Jezebel was a meal ticket how many ministers is sitting at some rich guys table because he's pouring in money there [Applause] is no rich man that can buy this man unto expensive [Applause] I don't sit at Jezebel's table to have food amen I work for my food I don't need no rich man to sit at his table and prophesy what he wants me to prophesy a meal ticket young man don't let anybody buy you [Applause] the way of a true minister doesn't sit at the table of these rich guys [Applause] they work for their money you know here's page one I haven't started preaching you [Applause] so the Continental Doctrine of the anti-message is for a young man to watch a woman to watch money to watch popularity money woman popularity how many of these men fell with women well you know that seven times this is the seven Villages but you slept with four women you want to tell me that's the virtues you're playing Seven Virtues huh and the guy that brought it amen died and he said he's gonna come back with blue eyes you wouldn't like this eh you don't like it huh but I'm here before all of them [Applause] woman money locks on a woman it's the same spirit when you have money you want more money when you have one woman and you've got a human Spirit you want another one Same Spirit when you are popular you want everybody to like you Same Spirit that's the Cardinal Doctrine of the message [Applause] what is it money Balaam woman Samson Delilah popularity Saul and then when they die these Thunder guys foreign but seventh under seven virtues [Applause] both fool somebody else you don't like it that's your business okay God called The Man God put into the church not the church put into the church Jeremiah 23 verse 4. and I was I God will shed set Shepherds over them which shall feed them the guy come to the pulpit and he's got nothing a quote after a quote after a quote after a quote they light the camel dry you know the quotes back to front how can you still read quotes to me that's 57 years here I know that I need something fresh on that quote and the only thing that kept the word fresh is that Shekinah Glory the only thing that will keep the the quotes fresh it's the baptism of the Holy Ghost [Applause] and I will put Shepherds not the church God will

his weapon The Preacher Man must become the praying man because that's his weapon brother Roscoe why are you so successful why is all your churches right around the country full I don't have to put a seat here and a seed here and a seed here to pull wool over people's eyes at my church is full put the seeds together then you only have two rows full the churches don't even have a hundred people anymore what's going on you're here for 20 years and you don't even have 20 people but what about you brother Oscar I got 3 000 in one place why because the preacher man must be a praying man everybody careful man but be careful [Applause] but [Applause] that's an undying unending weapon the ears that hears him he is him forever if he prayed over the sermon I want to tell you something you know in the lockdown nobody had Church and we just play tapes and I baptize a hundred people without having church just from the tapes [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] the ears that Hears A man that comes from his knees hears him forever the anointing just come off the tape we play tapes that I preached 25 years ago and that tapes will still win souls why [Applause] why must he pray because the real sermons is made in the closet in the study alone with God when he is alone with God then the real sermon come and he preached that sermon and that sermon is energized for 20 solid years [Music] Hallelujah and the people that hear that sermon says man it looks as if this thing was preached just the other day why because that sermon was made on his knees in the closet of his study [Applause] the modern preacher the more money he gets and the more secure he is by money amen is the preacher that has come up from his knees he prays and he gets and he don't pray anymore no ready Mana the Mercedes-Benz Equity you know Mike but [Applause] I'm going to close I don't say the man say closing he never closer he lies I didn't say what time I'm gonna close [Applause] but lest they pray the more money they make they pray Lord give me a million God gives him a million and then after that they don't pray luxury spoils the preacher it takes him from his knees and close the engine of his soul towards holiness these profound as conviction is born in secret conversation and communion with God oh my best times is when I'm alone and I speak to God that's my best time [Applause] that's the reason the world over go wherever you want to I challenge you in the name of God go wherever there's a message Church and go and see how weak the pulpit is just be honest you know there's no honest people in this message they're not honest ly why must I hear one quote after one quote after one quote amen and I know the quotes I'm hearing the quotes for 60 years man certificate it's Anna the life-giving preacher is the true man of God oh I like a thirsty preacher man that makes other people thirsty what a man that is after he leaves the pulpit he sermons lost for over 20 years [Applause] now the preacher that kills is a preacher without the spirit that's the preacher that kills near my end Spirit isn't moved by the word is false anointed ones and the word without the spirit is false anointed ones and the spirit and the word without the spirit is foolish virgin if the spirit isn't mixed with the word it kills the latter killeth by the spirit giveth life remember this young man never preach without the Holy Ghost it's the letter preacher that kills that preaching without the spirit kills why do you think the message right around the world is dead because we only gave them word all the time right in America all over they did why because there's no spirit it's in word word word word word man is a bunch of nonsense says it [Applause] it kills word preaching kills so a young man makes that word with a meal and the oil you'll have a cake coming it's a letter preacher that kills the word messages are only word in this message and the person because those has a glorious time jubilating praising God even without the word they're more happier than what we are so when I'm in a message you know we're going to hold my message you know but just do it he's doing it [Applause] the elected Pentecostals forms the headstall now how can you be elected Pentecostal when you sit like this the preaching that kills is a shapely and orderly and eloquent and fluent Place preaching and no spirit it kills more than error this is told the letter it's told that date later the letter was dead in the Old Testament it was cold it was formal until that seed came into the New Testament and the duck flew over Mary and then the the word loved but it was dead all the time [Applause] [Music] [Applause] amen Philippians come Glory no God is Not mocked you can
