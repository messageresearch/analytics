to welcome the Brazilians back [Applause] [Music] [Applause] I I wonder how do you feel did I tell you the truth that there's no church like El Tabernacle every girl told me they had the back it says man it's just nice to be back you people are something else man God don't have to beg you to worship Him you just do [Music] it so God bless you and we're happy to have you [Applause] back oh and I would like to uh thank everybody I realize I did with uh the New Year's meeting and uh there's other brothers that I didn't mention if I didn't mention your name remember you included in the names of the other people amen we all one amen so I want to thank you the ones that supports the cause here with their tithes offerings and presents and special offerings we um want to thank you once again I want to thank the nurses last weekend Sunday I was laying with pipes in me and they came over Sunday and they come in and ministered to me and um this week I Hopple along I didn't know if I'm going to make make it in the poop this evening but I'm here so I want to thank them uh for coming and uh I don't know which doctor was behind them that gave the inscription for the nurses to administer to me so I thank God and uh may God richly bless you I feel fine and then uh I just want to say that um we straighten our things and uh it's just the kimy um an ail's problem you seen Adel quite back for quite some time and Ed said uh him and Kimmy is not together for a year and a half they they've decided that they want to serve God they divorced [Music] hallah and uh Ariel told us that um he don't even want to bother the Rosco family we must just allow him to come to church and um is doing just that and uh Kimmy called me in I think about a month ago or so and you you know I take my time I like to pray over things she told me that she's back in chelberg and uh she and a is not together and she said she knows that they have done wrong which I told the world you know brother when I said it if they don't do what I tell them they going to hell my son or who ever he is amen the word of God has no biasness it's like [Applause] [Music] that and they listened to me and she said well she realized that she' done wrong she asked forgiveness and um she says well she didn't do anything else because all the time time she just wanted to serve God and uh I said well if they're not together and they have separated and they live like single people by all means it's fine they could come serve God so um we uh also laid down a few things that U they have to do that's why I took a little time for to make the announcement here so um IO to God that God would look down on them and show Mercy amen and then I I need to tell you this one a certain brother by the name of brother Benny I think Edwards that Indian brother that came from Newcastle and he came and served God here and he left here and he went to branky and I don't know he left there where the deacy is now I don't know but apparently he said he was praying and God spoke to his heart and he spoke in tongues and the interpretation was a message to brother Rosal and uh he found Charlton is Charlton here Charlton right at the back there and he told Charlton to hand over the message to me and the message was uh through tongues and the message was in three parts one I must give over L Tabernacle to Jonathan two I must get my house in order and three I must present I must repent and God will show me of what so I've listened send him a message back and um I just felt that this God that has spoken to him it's a bit mixed up [Applause] um maybe maybe you heard from hery Krishna [Applause] now why I say so is that I let him know and he was in the church he knows it I think 20 years ago I then did handle the church over to Jonathan who's the head pastor of el Jonathan is running the church the Deacon board the trustey board the ministers the Bings for 20 years now you want to tell me my God don't know that [Applause] Point number two get your house in order well the thing is is that if it means my natural house there's only one in that house that's me you want to tell me God don't know that now what house must I get in order if it means I must get myself in order that entails when brother brandham and them speak about it that my time is up I'm busy living that one I welcome because I've been struggling in this poopit for 59 years and I worked because I want to get in there [Applause] number three is I must repent God will show me of what now again I don't understand this God I'm busy with my God every morning between 2: and 4: every morning between two and four I plead my case I beg him I think Denny still sleeps and snores that time when I'm busy with [Applause] him since a young man I never ever stopped praying at that time up till now so of what must I Repent when I Repent every morning for Thought word and deed and I ask God for your repentance and to forgive you Al every morning [Applause] now say for instance I had something and I asked God for forgiveness every morning you'll forgive me isn't that making my house in order or how do you get your house in order by repenting now I can't understand how funny this God is when he came to David he told David he son when he came to Moses he told Moses he son wherever he went he tell the people what they sinned but when it comes to Edgar Osco you don't tell me what's my son so I say this and not to be funny let his hery Krishna God go to hell and I cannot understand why can God speak to you know when I was in India they call guys like that num poop talk to a guy like that but he speak to me 59 years for 59 years he spoke to [Music] me can you see what I go through church [Music] now I see the colonell on Thursday I don't see him yet tonight um I went over there and uh I went going to ask him to check all the Rosco's phones if it's not hacked that's a word right and uh because I feel something funny and uh he says no by Monday you'll know if your phone is hugged and uh somebody breaks into your phone to listen to you but I would like them to check all the Rosco phones so be careful what you speak over your phone exactly amen my Lord I and he told me um they can do it and they can trace the people and uh the thing is this that um what happened when they broke into my house and uh what I don't understand is I I'm a very Thrifty guy with my celery I I always put something away even if it's TR but I must put money away I don't spend my whole wages so they knew exactly where I put the money and they stole all that money just came in the house take the money out of the house where I sted it now who knows that so I made them check the house the same guys that's going to check the phone uh special guys from the force and I must say they're very good they picked up everything check my car everything if it's um not uh the dubbed or and uh they picked up things because we we put in some uh security systems you know three of them if the one fail the other one will get you that one fail the other one will get you and they picked it up and I knew know these guys are professional so they checking they're going to check our phone and uh we will know who it is he mentioned names to me already but I'll keep quiet and it's a criminal offense to do a thing like that so we will know by Monday what's happening there so that's what uh the vision of brother Indian now I'm also half Indian I'm mixed up anyhow I don't even know what I [Music] am I I love for um no no I said we pray I prayed that time in the morning and I I just wake up I don't have an alarm he wakes me up exactly that time to talk to me all my life [Applause] and then when Mahari come and she starts at 8:00 and we have another prayer meeting and then I go and do my chores after that so a lot of prayer goes into the thing understand and um so yeah um the colonell will let us person all by Monday and then um that was not the first time it happened um that a thing like that um occurred I was give over the church uh December another guy came from America Luke Gibson I don't even know the guy a Johnny come lately that also wants to be on the pedestal and he came and he preached in brother tm's previous Church where um the concerns took over elwin m Christopher start I called him the three Baptist preachers I wonder how could tum all Baptist like that guys that's not anointed put him out of his church I'll take all three of them one time and Chuck them out in front of everybody no guy with no Holy Ghost mess around with us man I know God [Applause] [Music] [Music] you know the meetings that we have in El Tabernacle mixup meetings people laying on the floor screaming jumping visions and all that PE Tabernacle never had one meeting like that for all the years that twim was there even now so how can they tell me [Applause] that's what thing that's why the thing busted the way it did so he comes around Mr American you know I never worried about American when I see American and I take out my sword there a bunch of brags man [Music] and he preached in that church a lot of things about me my clothing and my dancing and all my ministers and all that but the thing he said other this is in one month Benny and him I just realized God speak to this one God spoke to that one and God spoke to him to preach through the through his preaching that I follow a Lal priesthood by handing the church over to my sons and we're not in the leidal priesthood we in the mesc priesthood that's what he said now if he comes from America and he knows that I gave it over to Jonathan how come Benny don't know how come this little Indian boy don't [Applause] know and then he's got the audacity to say I must come and see him I must run after him a man like [Music] me he must go to heav Krishna man [Music] now in so many words Gibson was also emphasizing hand over the church I cannot give it to my sons I must give it to somebody outside of the family yeah I've got Benny Benny says You must give it to your to Jonathan here Gibson comes and says no I can't to who did God speak to the two of those guys how come God gives two different messages in one month that's not my God one month [Applause] I'm sorry I am very very sorry to which one must I listen to then we had brother bapes brother Shan's son-in-law brother Shan's son-in-law that was with that Prophet the two of them together uh can you see I don't do these guys nothing so all the devil's eyes is upon [Applause] [Music] [Music] and they founded us and says that God spoke to this Prophet guy and to bapes I hope Garden jinda listen to what I got to say now and then they told Jonathan that God spoke to the prophet and told the prophet through babes that they're coming up to joerg and uh with all the papers transfer papers because God said we must hand the church over to them [Applause] and they told Jonathan they said Jonathan just keep the title deeds and a pen you just sign and all the rosos must get out of the church they'll take [Applause] over and Jonathan answered and Jonathan says yeah come come come up brother where are you now he says no we're on our way we just getting the last papers and we'll be there so Jonathan says come up man brothers because God spoke to me too [Applause] and God said if you come up here we'll be waiting for you we'll give both of you some blue eyes like Coleman that's what God told us we never heard from them again hallu so brother Godwin don't say that we didn't handle the man I handled [Applause] him then we were in elders and uh the church was growing and I put up that um balcony there and the church was growing and another guy walked up to me that's in the church he says Pastor Ros I have a message from God to you I said yeah what's it he says I had a vision and in the vision I saw your shoeses walk through I said now what does that man mean it means your ministry is finished and God is going to take you and you must give over the church to me and then in 1987 when brother Raymond Thompson and them split the church not they let they split ugly I heard the knock on my door stadi in anadale I opened the door yes stand a man when I looked at him it was Mr Bon beer Greg's Bon Bear's father and Kenny alus and Cliffy Marshall's stepfather he the man stand at the door I said good afternoon what's the best in bear he said good afternoon he says I don't have much time I have a message from God to you I said to him okay he said can I come in came in my wife let him sit he said don't even worry to make tea this is a a quick thing because you must do it right now and C Bon Beer's father then said God spoke to him him and God told him that I must repent and I must give the church over I said Mr Bon beer when did God say I must give it up say right now if I walk out here you must just hand it over I said oh right now yeah and I looked at him my wife standing there I said was the best you tell me what God is this said what do you mean I said you stink like a tobacco Factory you just smoked before you came here I said then you got to T in you too but does God don't tell you you must must repent of that tobacco repent of that drinking repent of your [Applause] falseness if I didn't have the Holy Ghost they would have taken the church but because I walk with the angel they will never get it right [Applause] so I feel like Jesus telling Peter Peter I pray for you because the devil want to Ser you church I pray for you cuz the devil is after you because there is no church like this church [Music] so after all these years they want to take my wife [Applause] now now that's not something new aimc wanted to take Sarah from Abram and God say you're a dead man and Benny you're a dead man you're a dead man [Music] [Applause] you know the guys that broke into my house we afterwards found the tag they used my tag for a whole year to go in and then we traced them and we went to the to the gate there with the insurance company they don't know how they got that tag my tag of all the people and then we throw the guy we got his car we got his number plate we got his address then brother Co and I went to his house and then he wasn't there and his wife told him so koven and them waited for a couple of weeks and they went back there when they went back there the wife says no he's in hospital says what's wrong brain Dam up till now you don't play with a man of God we had to close the case because the guys are vegetable and it just happened they don't know what how it happened and we will get them that hugs our [Applause] phones okay that was my commands you see you have to pray for this man let's go to Exodus 19 verse 19 and let us see how far we can get into this message Exodus chapter 19 verse 19 and when the voice of the trumpet sounded long and waxed louder and louder Moses spake and God answered him by a voice father I give this scripture into your hands I'm not capable I'm just your servant may you grant unto me the [Music] Insight of this word that I want to preach tonight I pray that he that has an ear let him hear May El Tabernacle be encouraged once more [Applause] I hand it over into your hands Lord thank you Jesus amen you may be [Applause] seated amen now I had um a phone call from somebody and he told me he said brother Rosco I've listened to all the conventions that was held over the Christmas the one in Dubai the one here the one in Deo Gloria the one in oton and there one in brother toam old church and he says I was searching for the Holy Ghost in all those conventions because all of them was echoing out we need the Holy Ghost we need the Holy Ghost and now it's not in my church and he said to me he said you know I don't find that thing that's in your church nowhere Hallelujah [Applause] even the one that people went to Brazil they don't have it like [Music] [Applause] it's so we are going to to have to fight to keep it [Applause] here you're going to have to [Applause] fight every dry [Applause] Spirit until you act like a maniac Israel's got the country they got the land but they can't sit St since 1946 when they got in they have to fight you can't be nice you can't be nice nice outside what are we nice amen you have to fight otherwise they kill [Applause] [Music] [Applause] you so I want to start with this quote out of the mouth of a prophet From The Heart Of God out of the heart of God to the mouth of a prophet can you say [Applause] that I don't hear you [Applause] the M of the prophet and this is what the mouth of the Prophet says Mark of the base 961 now watch he ask you to watch don't just accept anything because nicey nicey being nicey nicey watch now my my title is the gospel trumpet and I was praying that another guy from Petoria is got green eyes you know and and gray comes his hair backwards he shouldn't catch this otherwise I'm going to have no message and I'm I'm I'm thankful for God God shut him up you know he said now watch you hear the gospel trumpet man I want you to read this quote hold it the what G what is the good news the Holy Ghost is what's the good news the Holy Ghost is de Gloria what's the good [Applause] news where yeah yeah yeah what's the good news the Holy Ghost is here then he ask the question out of a mouth of a prophet he asked the question how do you know it how do you know it it says watch it work see what it does it's the good news [Music] [Applause] watch it works how does it work make the people drunk working of the Holy Spirit make the people people shout working of the Holy Spirit make the people speak in [Applause] tongues working of the Holy Ghost make the people working of the Holy [Applause] Ghost if the Holy Ghost is here then those working of the Holy Ghost must also be here is it here [Music] [Applause] hallu and he says that's the good news [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] he the working of the Holy Spirit the other quotation says what make you jump what make you shout What Make You Dance it's a supernatural being in you I make you jump I Make You Dance I make you worship that brings down the glory of God [Music] then if it is like that then the good news is here L Tabernacle the good news there is no other better [Applause] news oh than you the good news the good news the good news the good news is I don't have to tell you to shout like they did in Deal Gloria you shout automatically listen to it man listen listen to it good news it is not like our magazines and TV news and CNN and skying news an Aleria that has 99% of it is bad news the big bold black letters of the newspapers so many reads so many died here so many died in Ukraine so many died here so many died here all that they feed on is bad news am I [Music] right the only way to attract the people in this day is to have bad [Applause] news that takes the headlines bad news the big those bold black lettuce trumpets out famine here and famine there and young people starving children starving with their bellies pushed out and their eyes popped out of the sockets of malnutrition bad news all over and the bad news also over social media where they said in dear Gloria that the Holy Ghost left for 40 years there was a lapse for 40 years bad news the Holy Ghost isn't there's bad news but in El Tabernacle it never ceased so where is the good news [Applause] P bad news then they trumpeting out no scriptural Doctrine 7,000 Seven Virtues that's bad news that's New York City's garbage SC it comes out of it comes out of New York City garbage [Applause] scan it's garbage there's no Bible for it how can you believe in it anything that's not Bible is [Applause] garbage seven Thunders is not the Seven Virtues because the Bible don't say so brother brandham don't say so I rode the track on the seven Thunders and I found difficult to get out to the Seven Virtues I wanted to go to okar but I found myself in Pick and Pay and then I found myself in checkers but I want to be in O Bazar so I had to go and scratch to try make the thing work at the end I didn't have a scripture and I look I say he this is a bunch of garbage FR one FR and I'm going to play it when I preach against the LIE of the Gloria and then they can write me a lawyer letter but this time I'm going to court everything is going to come out this time and I want the newspapers to be there this time [Applause] [Music] [Applause] but now brother Rosco have you got Bible for the seven Thunders Hallelujah being the seven Messengers Hallelujah well I'd like to call up our English teacher that's got a decree in English and that marks the papers of the grade 12 for the Department not like me and brother Raymond that didn't even Pass Time Sate five now I could I could ask the doctors here and I could ask the engineers here but I'm going to ask her because she's now like the authority on English as far as the department is let us hear from her okay bless you amen I'm going to put the scripture on the board and he crowd with a loud voice as when a lion roar it and when he had cried seven Thunders utter their voices now I just want her to explain that three words there utter there and voices I want to go and sit and I hope elado Park Assembly listens because you're following a lie in Alor good evening Al Tabernacle I think you are going to be my biggest class I've ever taught so here we go let's English so to utter means to speak say or Express something aloud often in words so take note they're not sounds they are sounds that are articulated in meaning so if an animal makes a sound you can't interpret it as a human being animals understand animals but when you utter as a person it comes across in words and therefore meaning the word there so we're not talking about the place t h e r e it's t h i e um e i r is a possessive pronoun now take note pronouns are used for people so if you want to say uh if you want to make your sentence um syntax correct you won't say the Apostle said that the Apostle will take the sermon in the apostles Church you say the Apostle said that he will take the sermon in his church so in this case the word there is not for one person but for many persons good so far okay let's go to voice voice is the sound produced when air from the lungs passes the vocal cords causing them to vibrate and it is shaped by the throat the tongue and the mouth into speech or song so if we pause there a moment take note that when the sound comes through your vocal cords so vocal chords in this case remember produces the sound so there's a difference between human sound and animal sound because although a whale makes a sound and can articulate meaning to another well you as a human won't understand it but now humans on the other hand have vocal chords they produce sound that articulate words and expression for meaning so in order for you to understand what the Apostle is saying he must produce the sound from his vocal cords through his mouth and then you will understand exactly what is happening in his mind and in his heart so let's just tie it to the scripture and please I'm not a preacher I'm only a teacher so here we go the seven Thunders had to utter words that carried meaning as indicated by the fact that what was said could have been written down so if you're going to the next verse in verse 4 that angel would not have been able to write anything or record anything if it wasn't words if it wasn't meaning so in essence that angel would have had nothing to record and we would not have been able to hear what comes from this gift over the [Applause] pulpit so let's link it back to the humans right because the argument is that the virtues are the Thunders and it can't be because a virtue is not a physical body a phys physical body carries vocal cords it needs to be within a human form and a virtue is not a human form it cannot articulate meaning it cannot carry or produce meaningful words in any way so I think the Apostle's view his standpoint his his anchor what is trying to bring across is that it is just not true it is fallible from the start thank you good good rala 10:4 now how could God use three words that actually refers to human beings they say if somebody actually come back on anything repeat anything then he actually he tells you watch but now he does it three times and show three times it's human [Applause] beings right then how can we be wrong when the Bible says it's human beings I don't care about elado Park I don't care about de Gloria I worry about the word of God go oh this will be nice in a court when if we go to court with a thing like this and they come with virtues the judge is going to shake his head man he's never going to agree with them he's going to agree Hallelujah with the truth amen seventh under seven virtues is garbage that's why when their founder died they said he's coming back with blue eyes [Applause] garbage now there you have it you know a nutshell now Sister Shanti that last verse also refers so clearly and plainly seal up those things which the seven Thunders so the seven Thunders uttered it which means it was spoken aloud it was spoken aloud so capital S seal so all seven was the seals that's what of the BAM says that there's a [Applause] scripture thank you we have the truth man and the Seven Thunders is our doct and the right Doctrine because the Bible said [Applause] so and that's the good news the good news the seven Thunders are banging [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] together Hallelujah now brother Owen pal likes English you know he's a typical English guy he gets excited when you hear English you think he's going to believe seven Thunder Seven Virtues after this I tell you he's not going to believe it because the Bible said [Applause] [Music] so okay let's take some interpretation on the Bible on Revelations 3 where Revelations 3 said is the seven messenges let's take Bible on Revelations 3 oh my what does the Africans say now we got the English say cl [Applause] cl po arus Mar Cola [Applause] man are these guys [Applause] [Music] [Applause] mad a virtue needs you need a body a virtue don't have a body we heard [Applause] so seven [Applause] bodies just play that again in fore do you think these guys but ex all offer up your stem Amen on [Applause] I just can't be wrong elado Park Assembly I can't be [Applause] wrong Hallelujah [Applause] and [Music] to and he be the off [Applause] now we got an English saying the seven Thunders is seven men human beings and God emphasizes it four times in Revelations 10 that it's human beings four times to ever add to this prophecy all the plagues all the [Applause] plagues now they can't come out anymore and accept this huj they get sealed with that lie brother sorry Rica told me yeah you you nail them all but they don't come out I says praise God you you speak like like Pharaoh spoke out of his own mouth come judgment that means they're in a wall City they Bard in their ear they can't come out can't hear the gospel [Applause] trumpet okay next we go to English Revelation 10:3 and cried with a loud voice as when a lion Roth and when he had cried seven Thunders uttered their voices that's a French and when the seven Thunders had uttered their voices I was about to write and I Heard a Voice from Heaven saying unto me seal up those things which the seven Thunders uttered and write them not that's what the french says the same thing let's have the Greek prophetic di clot that's a Greek the DI clot and this is what it said yeah I read it and this is the Greek and that's what it means and crowed with a loud voice as a lion roars and when he cried the the seven Thunders after to their voices the Greek says the same thing all the languages says the same thing only the bush in in in in elor Park El Park can say it's it's honors amen but bu Hallelujah we said seven Thunders is the seven Messengers [Applause] okay thank you [Music] [Applause] you need to ground your people now we in the Bible right did you see it for yourself [Applause] okay brother brandham spent his whole life trying to get us back in the Bible his whole life that's why El NE we can't take anything that's not in the Bible [Applause] okay the uncertain sounds he says God will keep his word no uncertainty about that when the trumpet of God sounds in your ear it doesn't change your ear listen to what it says if it sounds in your yeah it doesn't then change right okay the ear job 34:3 when it sounds in your ear [Applause] the ear the ear tries now if you say seventh th Seven Virtues the ear try that and say that's not the word am I right I don't hear [Applause] if alerado Park amen say seven Thunders is is a seven virtues then the ear said no man brother brandham don't say so the ear tries it how can I help it my ear ties there and I find out that's not the melody of the word of almighty God that's not aen in the gim sheet of the great [Applause] Shalom even you you go to any church and you sit there and then you come out you says no man this is not why because your ear try [Applause] [Music] it can you turn to the one that's next to you and tell him or her you see my ear tries everything that comes from the pit [Applause] because it has no uncertain sound when anybody preach anything that brother brandham never said it's an uncertain sound seven Thunder Seven Virtues uncertain sound carbage of New York City [Applause] and when the ear years the gospel trumpet it's all finished then you can't help the people they can go to Brazil they can go to another church they can go to England but the year it know am I [Applause] [Music] [Applause] right but yeah if your ear rejected you will reject [Music] it then the quote comes to point number two and point number two is it says that the Holy Ghost is here thank Youk you now they can hold it ghost Holy Ghost Holy Ghost like they want to but they have to have the working of the Holy [Applause] Ghost which you don't have I didn't see it in the [Applause] Gloria now what's the working of the Holy Spirit have you got a CLP the working of the Holy Spirit the club of the convention that's our that's our deal Glory W the

Testament in my blood this do ye as of as you drink it in remembrance of me for as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord you do show the Lord's dead till he come wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord but let a man examine himself and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup for he that eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh Damnation to himself not Discerning the Lord's body for this cause many are weak and sickly among you and many sleep for if we
