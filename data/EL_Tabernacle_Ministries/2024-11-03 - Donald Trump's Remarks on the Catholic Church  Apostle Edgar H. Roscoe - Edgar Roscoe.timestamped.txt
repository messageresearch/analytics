[0:00] okay well
[0:03] we greet you
[0:05] again and
[0:07] again
[0:09] again in The Only Name That's
[0:12] blessed only name that's
[0:16] glorified only
[0:18] name that bears
[0:21] life Jesus king
[0:24] God we
[0:27] um a GL GL again happy
[0:31] to make this
[0:34] recording and um so that you Al bacle
[0:40] people may
[0:42] know the hour and the time and what's
[0:46] going
[0:47] on as I told uh the family about what I
[0:53] see last
[0:55] night on TV about Visionaries
[1:00] people that can look in the
[1:03] future and
[1:05] decipher
[1:07] what is coming what is going to happen
[1:11] and we know that's Bible the Bible says
[1:14] without Vision the people
[1:17] perish so um that's why we feel that we
[1:21] want to do this clip
[1:25] before the elections on
[1:27] Tuesday of the uh presidency of the
[1:31] United
[1:32] States we
[1:34] U Know That
[1:37] U now that there's two things running
[1:41] here the Roman Catholic church and
[1:45] Camila we just want to focus
[1:49] on Trump and play the clips of
[1:54] trump uh with the Roman Catholic church
[1:57] and his commence
[2:01] about the Roman Catholic
[2:03] church and um never
[2:08] before was it taken into
[2:11] consideration and asking
[2:14] for the Catholics to
[2:17] vote and putting them on a
[2:19] pedestal where Trump has put them under
[2:23] so when we mentioned this in the
[2:27] previous Clips I know it was a shocker
[2:31] because it shocked me when I saw there's
[2:35] two possibilities here with
[2:38] this
[2:39] elections and uh and I saw the Roman
[2:43] Catholic
[2:44] church and uh whether it goes camil
[2:48] camil's way whether it goes Trump's way
[2:52] it just don't look
[2:55] good so um Trump as made the statements
[3:01] and we want to play it to you so that
[3:04] you know even before
[3:07] Tuesday either of
[3:09] them spells
[3:12] chaos to the
[3:15] world so uh I hope you enjoy it I hope
[3:18] your eyes open I hope you see it I hope
[3:23] you go
[3:25] dissect the quote End quotes on the
[3:30] Roman Catholic church we know that such
[3:32] a those scriptures that stand behind
[3:34] that Revelation 17 and Mark of the Beast
[3:37] Revelations 13
[3:41] America and uh Rome together
[3:47] so I want my people to know exactly
[3:52] what's taking place and I like what
[3:54] somebody else says he says well remember
[3:57] if it don't come to pass there's still
[4:00] another election in front of us the
[4:03] prophet stands and I want to say why
[4:10] because in spite of the the prophecy and
[4:13] the vision it might ter but it says
[4:18] wait for its fulfillment now we've
[4:21] waited 91
[4:24] years for this prophecy could it be the
[4:28] time and uh uh we saw that the Jubilee
[4:33] 1th Jubilee has finished last week and
[4:38] Friday we seen what happened with the
[4:42] bombing of
[4:44] U
[4:46] um uh the
[4:48] [Music]
[4:49] CH and
[4:51] um and I also would like to say uh
[4:55] Monday that
[4:56] pass was also a good date for us because
[5:00] that was the date when brother Bram laid
[5:02] hands on me in um maranata Park so
[5:07] everything was a cluster everything was
[5:09] together so I pray that uh this will be
[5:12] a blessing for
[5:14] you amen thank you from that time
[5:18] brother Bram says
[5:20] 1960 the 7 month 16th day he says thus
[5:26] saith the Lord in other words God said
[5:32] it not brother brandham God said
[5:37] it there'll be a woman rule a woman rule
[5:44] before the end time listen here before
[5:48] the end time she'll either be
[5:52] president or vice
[5:55] president or the Roman Catholic Church
[6:02] listen there's three important points in
[6:06] this quote Point number one before the
[6:11] end
[6:13] time why does he say before the end
[6:17] time because the seventh vision is the
[6:21] end time the a Bor the seventh trumpet
[6:27] Revelations
[6:28] 11:14 the the Third Woe cometh quickly
[6:32] it comes quickly after her that's the
[6:38] end remember that so her coming
[6:43] in is not the end of the
[6:46] world get me straight please but the
[6:50] bride is gone then when this happens
[6:54] when the bomb Falls when that wo comes
[7:00] remember the bride is gone before the
[7:04] end of the world in other words she
[7:07] won't see the end of the world so
[7:11] brother BR says a woman will
[7:13] rise she'll be he says she'll be
[7:16] president or vice
[7:19] president well she's running for both
[7:22] she already fold the
[7:25] one she is and was
[7:30] the vice
[7:32] president and now she's
[7:36] running to be a candidate for
[7:41] presidency so the quote is running with
[7:44] God's will so
[7:46] far we're going to bring this back again
[7:49] to you her rise was
[7:53] 1990 Deputy district attorney 2000
[7:57] courtroom prosecutor Francisco
[8:01] 20 uh
[8:03] 2003 district attorney 2010 general
[8:08] attorney
[8:10] 2016 US senator 2020 elected vice
[8:16] president
[8:18] 2024 president
[8:21] candidate isn't the scary
[8:31] straight with the
[8:37] quote anybody can see this could it
[8:41] be El
[8:44] Tabernacle could it
[8:46] be so the quote is running with God's
[8:51] will so
[8:54] far from the same
[8:56] quote from that time he says
[9:00] or the Catholic
[9:03] church so here we see distinctly two
[9:06] woman a natural woman that will be voted
[9:12] in and a spiritual woman which is the
[9:15] Roman Catholic Church that's not voted
[9:18] in she just comes in but the natural
[9:23] woman that will be president she gets
[9:26] voted in so I never saw this just the
[9:29] other day and as I went through the
[9:32] quotes and I think there's about 200 or
[9:35] so many quotes or even more uh and all
[9:40] if you read
[9:41] really those quotes you'll see he speaks
[9:45] every time of two
[9:47] woman that's
[9:49] why we have two candidates for the two
[9:54] woman one is Trump and the other one is
[9:57] Camila
[9:59] one will be Camila that is voted in so
[10:03] far we see how her votes
[10:05] went the other one might be Trump that
[10:08] will let the Roman Catholic Church come
[10:11] in because of the
[10:13] pressure of the Roman Catholic
[10:17] church because America owes her
[10:20] trillions of dollars they can't even pay
[10:24] back the interest so will she put the
[10:27] screws on Trump if he he gets elected
[10:31] and he will give in then to her and
[10:34] afterwards speak as the
[10:37] dragon it's two scenarios here because
[10:41] the Roman Catholic Church when he says
[10:43] the Roman Catholic Church he says I got
[10:45] it in
[10:46] Brackets and you know what that mean I
[10:49] don't have to take it to
[10:51] school so
[10:53] um he says all the Catholic Church two
[10:57] woman then he concludes the
[11:01] quote by saying thus saith the
[11:07] Lord so it must come to
[11:12] pass is this the season for
[11:15] it you might have to check that thing
[11:21] out president Trump we are so honored to
[11:25] have you join us in in front of this
[11:28] very very
[11:29] important faith summit uh you are my
[11:33] friend and I am so blessed to have been
[11:35] a part of your life some people don't
[11:36] know for over 24 years as a part of I
[11:40] feel not only family but you're pastor
[11:42] and an advisor and I got to work in the
[11:45] White House and represent people Faith
[11:47] as senior advisor to Faith initiative
[11:49] and opportunity one of the greatest
[11:51] honors ever we have thousands of pastors
[11:54] here and Faith leaders and their number
[11:57] one issue that they want to know about
[12:00] is what about your faith we're going
[12:03] through a lot of problems in our country
[12:05] if you take a look at the anger the the
[12:08] uh the problems that we have and a lot
[12:10] of it is that it's less based on
[12:13] religion now than it was 25 years ago
[12:15] and 50 years ago and I mean we were a
[12:18] really people would say a Christian and
[12:21] really religious even other Faith's
[12:24] country and that seems to be heading in
[12:27] the wrong direction and I think as that
[12:28] goes goes uh down I think that our
[12:32] country goes down I really do I think
[12:34] this is a country that needs religion
[12:36] it's like the glue that holds it
[12:38] together and we don't we don't have that
[12:41] that's why you are the most important
[12:43] people and I'm not sure you even realize
[12:45] it and they're trying to hurt you
[12:48] they're trying to sty you this new
[12:50] Administration this new uh radical left
[12:52] group of people and it's not so new it's
[12:55] been around for a while and uh there are
[12:58] people that are not nice people if
[13:00] you're if you happen to be Catholic we
[13:02] don't have too many Catholics here maybe
[13:04] but boy they are trying they are
[13:06] persecuting Catholics I actually said
[13:08] how could a Catholic possibly vote for
[13:11] Kamala how could that I know the level
[13:13] of anger and the level of uh vitrio you
[13:17] know when you see uh what's going on
[13:20] with the FBI and the Catholic church I
[13:22] say what is happening and you know the
[13:24] expression is that you're next because
[13:27] they're all everybody's next next with
[13:29] this group and they have a very bad
[13:31] agenda and we have to stop it and we
[13:33] have to win this election I think
[13:35] winning this election I think it's going
[13:36] to be the most important election in the
[13:38] history of our country
[13:40] absolutely thank you
[13:42] everybody well thank you very much it's
[13:44] an honor and we are doing well by the
[13:47] way the votes are starting to come in
[13:48] you got to get out and vote and
[13:50] Catholics you got to vote for me just
[13:52] remember you better remember I'm here
[13:55] and she's not I could have done that
[13:57] too but you do something that's
[14:00] incredible the Catholic Church you're
[14:01] helping the poor educating children and
[14:04] supporting the vulnerable all polls are
[14:07] indicating I'm leading big with a
[14:09] Catholic vote as I should be as I should
[14:14] be I want to thank the Al Smith
[14:16] foundation for its Noble work and I want
[14:19] to express my tremendous gratitude to
[14:22] the Catholic Community it's a great
[14:25] Community it's a community I've gotten
[14:26] along with all my life I tell you when I
[14:28] was
[14:29] when I was President I was in the Oval
[14:32] Office and I got a call from the
[14:34] Cardinal and he said we need help it was
[14:38] during the China virus I want to be
[14:39] accurate when I describe it and he said
[14:43] we need help our schools are in
[14:46] devastating shape they needed much more
[14:49] than a billion I won't even tell you the
[14:50] number but much more than a billion
[14:52] dollars but I've known the community and
[14:55] I've known the the schools I knew I know
[14:57] so many people that were educated in the
[14:59] Catholic school system and they are
[15:02] great and they just speak with it like
[15:03] with love much more so than almost any
[15:06] system that I've seen and he said sir we
[15:09] have uh a big problem we need a number
[15:13] of billions of dollars or we're going to
[15:15] have to close down the New York school
[15:17] system the whole system in New
[15:19] York and I said give me 15 minutes I
[15:22] think I can find it and we gave him
[15:25] billions of dollars and you know what he
[15:27] stayed open and they thrive and to this
[15:30] day I hear you did just about the best
[15:32] job there is in
[15:34] education
[15:36] so and that was always an honor that was
[15:39] always and every time he sees me he says
[15:41] thank you very much I said I know what
[15:43] you're talking about but we work
[15:45] together we were a good partnership
[15:46] right we got that money in about 15
[15:48] minutes billions and uh it was put to
[15:51] very good use but I just want to thank
[15:53] everybody this is a special evening Less
[15:55] Than 3 weeks to go till election day
[15:57] here in the United States and the race
[15:59] for president appears to be tightening
[16:02] there's a new National Catholic Reporter
[16:04] poll showing Trump up among Catholics in
[16:08] five of the seven swing States tonight
[16:11] the former president and current GOP
[16:13] candidate talks with me again about the
[16:16] issues important to people of Faith
[16:18] about life and those multiple
[16:21] assassination attempts we met at the
[16:23] 79th annual Al Smith dinner for the arch
[16:26] dasis of New York a dinner his opponent
[16:29] vice president kamla Harris has declined
[16:32] to attend here's my exclusive interview
[16:35] with President Donald J
[16:37] Trump Mr President I'm delighted first
[16:39] of all that you made the Downtown Abbey
[16:41] auditions we I think we're going to fit
[16:43] in nicely we're at the alith dinner of
[16:45] course tell me why did you decide it was
[16:48] important to be here and what message is
[16:51] kamla Harris sending by not being here
[16:53] to Catholic voters well I think you're
[16:55] honoring the Catholic church and you
[16:57] know I've been uh long time supporter
[17:00] and I'm surprised she's not here I think
[17:01] she's the first one in many many in
[17:03] decades actually to miss it as a
[17:05] candidate it was always been a tradition
[17:08] so I'm happy only that the Catholics are
[17:10] going to vote for Trump now but uh no
[17:14] it's look I have a special relationship
[17:16] with the Catholic church and I uh I
[17:19] think it was very important to be here
[17:21] yeah uh I've been noticing on your
[17:22] social media posts on your at your
[17:24] rallies you're playing the a Maria
[17:27] you're posting happy birthday Mary a St
[17:30] Michael prayer to ward off evil is that
[17:33] telling voters something about your
[17:34] spiritual journey what is that no I
[17:36] don't think it's just beautiful to me I
[17:38] mean I I look at the whole thing the
[17:40] words and the pictures the pictures are
[17:42] so beautiful and uh yeah I put up some
[17:45] stuff somebody else asked me that same
[17:46] question and it's really that I think
[17:48] it's really very beautiful okay in 2020
[17:51] you told me I am a pro-life
[17:55] candidate in the interim you got rid of
[17:57] roie Wade and you've said I've returned
[18:00] it to the states and people have to
[18:01] follow their heart some of your
[18:04] supporters is saying well Trump is
[18:06] pro-choice now what would you say to
[18:08] them no no uh I am like Ronald Reagan
[18:11] before me the exceptions are very
[18:14] important to me and that's the life of
[18:16] the mother rape and incest and uh not at
[18:19] all I'm very proud of what we did
[18:21] everybody wanted it to be back in the
[18:23] States where it belongs and the states
[18:25] are voting and frankly some of the votes
[18:26] are very liberal by comparison to what
[18:28] people may have thought but it's now
[18:30] back in the States it's an issue that's
[18:32] torn the country apart for 52 years and
[18:35] now uh and everybody wanted it Democrats
[18:38] Republicans conservatives uh liberals
[18:40] everybody and all legal Scholars wanted
[18:43] it back in the States and now we did
[18:45] that and I have to tell you I give great
[18:47] credit to brilliant Supreme Court
[18:49] Justices we had six brilliant Supreme
[18:52] Court Justices and uh they had great
[18:55] courage and I think the country will now
[18:57] come together will you rein at the
[18:59] Mexico City policy which forbids
[19:01] International spending on abortion well
[19:04] I was the only one that did that as you
[19:05] know no other president did that and
[19:07] we're going to be giving that a very
[19:08] good serious look in other words how
[19:10] that compares and competes with the
[19:12] states but we'll be giving that a very
[19:13] serious look the other day you said I'm
[19:15] the father of IVF as you know some
[19:17] Catholics feel and the Catholic Church
[19:20] believes when you implement this
[19:23] technology you're killing embryos will
[19:25] you have a religious exemption to your
[19:28] IV F mandate for religious organizations
[19:31] and businesses that feel this violates
[19:33] my religious principle well you know I
[19:34] haven't been asked that but it sounds to
[19:36] me like a pretty good idea frankly but
[19:38] uh even Catholics a lot of them they
[19:40] want IVF it's fertilization basically
[19:43] and uh you know they view that as
[19:45] helping a family helping uh parents have
[19:48] a child and it's a very popular thing
[19:51] but certainly if there's a religious uh
[19:54] problem I think people should go with
[19:55] that I should be I I really think they
[19:57] should be able to do that but we'll look
[19:59] at that have an exemption well I got to
[20:02] look I got to get some new ones in here
[20:04] KLA Harris is changing her tactic
[20:07] against you she said to Brett Bear my
[20:09] colleague the other night you president
[20:12] Trump are targeting Americans uh you're
[20:14] calling them the Enemy Within and you're
[20:16] turning the military on the American
[20:18] people you and I both know that he has
[20:21] talked about turning the American
[20:22] Military on the American people he has
[20:24] talked about going after people who are
[20:27] engaged in peaceful protest
[20:29] he has talked about locking people up
[20:31] because they disagree with him this is a
[20:34] democracy your reaction to that and what
[20:36] did you mean when you said the Enemy
[20:38] Within well it's ridiculous that she
[20:40] says that they turning the military
[20:42] these are the really these are the
[20:44] threat to democracy people like actually
[20:46] like her with her language you know
[20:48] she's the most liberal senator in the
[20:50] Senate uh not as smart as most of them
[20:52] but she's certainly more liberal and she
[20:55] likes to say that turning the military
[20:57] how ridiculous is it but I will say this
[21:00] uh the enemy from within we do have an
[21:02] enemy from within we have people that uh
[21:05] are I think more danger to our country
[21:07] when you see the radical left programs
[21:09] that they're espousing and uh we have a
[21:12] a true enemy from within they hate when
[21:14] I say that but whether we like it and I
[21:16] think in many ways it's more dangerous
[21:18] from the outside enemies that we have I
[21:20] want to talk about immigration for a
[21:22] moment the church teaches welcome The
[21:24] Immigrant it also teaches that a nation
[21:27] has a right to protect it borders for
[21:29] the common good how do you president
[21:31] Trump balance welcoming The Immigrant
[21:34] with locking down the border and the
[21:36] deportation promise You' made well as
[21:38] you know we had the strongest borders
[21:39] we've ever had just four years ago we
[21:41] had the most powerful the strongest we
[21:43] let people in but they have to come
[21:44] illegally and I don't think that's
[21:46] changed we want people to come into our
[21:48] country but they have to come illegally
[21:50] uh as you know they allowed people to
[21:52] come in from prisons and frankly
[21:54] murderers the
[21:55] 13,099 murderers where they were let out
[21:58] of prison and convicted murderers and
[22:00] some killed more than one person some
[22:01] killed more than five people and they're
[22:04] now free in our country and we're going
[22:05] to have to get them out and we're going
[22:06] to get them out fast nobody wants that
[22:08] no I want to have people come into our
[22:11] country legally but we have to have
[22:12] strong borders and good elections did
[22:15] you see this lip reader when Joe Biden
[22:18] and Barack Obama were on the side of
[22:20] Ethel Kennedy's funeral this lipr reader
[22:22] who's a forensic expert claims Joe Biden
[22:25] said she's not as strong as I I am was
[22:29] it a mistake to trade KLA Harris for Joe
[22:32] Biden in your opinion well we seem to be
[22:35] winning and we were way up in Joe we had
[22:37] the debate and the numbers were very
[22:39] strong and I just see numbers that are
[22:41] very similar right now they're very
[22:43] similar so we'll see what happens I hope
[22:44] we win because we want to make America
[22:47] great again yeah and and your record of
[22:49] religious liberty how important is that
[22:51] to you religious liberty uh it's a
[22:53] stance that I've taken from the
[22:55] beginning and I'll keep it I wouldn't
[22:57] change it for anything okay final
[22:59] question the pope was asked about your
