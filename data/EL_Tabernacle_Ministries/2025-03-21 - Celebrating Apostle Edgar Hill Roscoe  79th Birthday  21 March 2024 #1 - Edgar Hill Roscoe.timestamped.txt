[1:08:46] [Applause]
[1:08:48] Heat. Heat.
[1:09:11] Hallelujah. Can we give
[1:09:15] our God?
[1:09:23] [Applause]
[1:09:27] in
[1:09:30] our most important
[1:09:33] person on the earth right
[1:09:36] now. Our apostle at your
[1:09:44] rust. Let's give him a
[1:09:49] shout. Let's give him a tough offering.
[1:09:58] [Music]
[1:10:06] We like to use the opportunity to
[1:10:10] [Music]
[1:10:11] welcome senior pastor, Pastor Jonathan
[1:10:16] Rosco. Let's give him a wonderful hand.
[1:10:22] You love our precious muscles.
[1:10:28] [Music]
[1:10:28] [Applause]
[1:10:29] [Music]
[1:10:33] [Applause]
[1:10:42] [Music]
[1:10:59] It's very quiet in here. Amen.
[1:11:14] [Applause]
[1:11:14] [Music]
[1:11:22] Heat up here.
[1:11:31] [Music]
[1:11:41] [Music]
[1:11:49] In
[1:11:52] 1979, the message of the hour was in a
[1:11:55] graveyard.
[1:11:59] There was no hallelujah.
[1:12:00] [Music]
[1:12:02] There was no Holy
[1:12:04] Ghost. There was no people shouting on
[1:12:07] the top of their
[1:12:09] voices. But I want you to know 1979
[1:12:15] came and the message is still trembling
[1:12:19] today because of
[1:12:24] 1979. That's why I say it's a bit quiet
[1:12:27] in here.
[1:12:28] [Music]
[1:12:30] The devil knows that
[1:12:33] 79 the silence was
[1:12:37] broken and it will never be silent
[1:12:47] again. Hallelujah.
[1:12:52] And today,
[1:12:54] [Music]
[1:12:56] Satan, right in this
[1:12:59] moment, it's 79
[1:13:03] again. That's why I say it's very quiet
[1:13:06] in
[1:13:11] here. It's very quiet in here.
[1:13:15] After all that
[1:13:16] singing, after that the morning when the
[1:13:20] sun came up,
[1:13:23] Satan, it's 79
[1:13:28] [Music]
[1:13:29] again. When God's house will never be
[1:13:32] quiet because when the man came around,
[1:13:36] he broke the
[1:13:38] silence. The man came around
[1:13:42] [Music]
[1:13:57] Hallelujah. If you still waiting for
[1:13:59] something, just
[1:14:01] shout. You still confused what where you
[1:14:04] are, just open your mouth and
[1:14:12] [Music]
[1:14:19] [Music]
[1:14:36] Wherever Jesus
[1:14:38] [Music]
[1:14:41] You'll hear a lot of
[1:14:46] noise. So, I want to greet you all in
[1:14:48] the name of Jesus
[1:14:50] Christ. I'm so glad that the apostle
[1:14:54] invited me to his
[1:14:56] [Music]
[1:14:58] birthday.
[1:14:59] Me, the least of all, he he invited me
[1:15:03] to be here. And what makes it worse, he
[1:15:06] asked me to say
[1:15:09] something. Oh, I feel
[1:15:12] honored. Out of 8 billion, I made it.
[1:15:15] [Music]
[1:15:21] Yeah. Same as
[1:15:23] [Music]
[1:15:26] somebody. So from the bottom of my
[1:15:30] heart, I want to
[1:15:32] [Music]
[1:15:35] say to this body that carries the power
[1:15:39] of God. Happy birthday, man of God.
[1:15:44] [Applause]
[1:15:45] [Music]
[1:15:52] I have a saying to my
[1:15:55] father every now and then when I look at
[1:15:58] him when I saw him say when he was 60
[1:16:01] when he preached crossing the line he
[1:16:03] said I'm an old
[1:16:05] man but now I don't believe he's an old
[1:16:09] man there's a young man living in this
[1:16:12] [Music]
[1:16:17] Morning. Hallelujah.
[1:16:24] And I keep saying to the apostle, do me
[1:16:26] a favor,
[1:16:27] Daddy. Just keep on
[1:16:31] breathing. When CO came, I said, "Oh,
[1:16:33] God man, just keep on
[1:16:36] breathing." And I'm so glad it is here
[1:16:39] with us today.
[1:16:42] words runs out when it comes to Apostle
[1:16:45] Ros. You can't say enough. It doesn't do
[1:16:50] justice to the work that God has done in
[1:16:53] our
[1:16:53] [Music]
[1:16:58] tabernacle. I just want to read a
[1:17:01] scripture or two. I don't have much to
[1:17:04] say.
[1:17:06] [Music]
[1:17:11] And the Bible says in Job
[1:17:16] 42:12, so the Lord blessed the letter of
[1:17:19] Job more of his blessings than what he
[1:17:23] began. The letter part of Job was
[1:17:26] blessed
[1:17:28] more. And I can see
[1:17:32] it and I'm a witness of it that the
[1:17:36] latter part was more
[1:17:39] blessed than when Job was
[1:17:42] blessed. So in blessing, God has blessed
[1:17:45] this
[1:17:46] man. Are you a witness of the letter?
[1:17:51] [Music]
[1:18:00] And just before that, the man that
[1:18:03] accused him of sin, God told those men,
[1:18:07] if that man don't pray for you, you're
[1:18:10] in trouble.
[1:18:11] And I'm so glad he prayed for all of us
[1:18:15] and we are not in
[1:18:16] [Music]
[1:18:19] trouble. Let's give the Lord a hand of
[1:18:22] praise.
[1:18:24] [Music]
[1:18:25] [Applause]
[1:18:26] [Music]
[1:18:28] Oh my my my
[1:18:30] my. Can I just say something
[1:18:34] quickly? Paul
[1:18:36] says, "Ye are all
[1:18:39] partakers. You are all
[1:18:41] partakers of my grace."
[1:18:46] And I am a witness today that today and
[1:18:50] this Revelation stand series and
[1:18:53] crossing the line, we are all partakers
[1:18:56] of God's apostles
[1:19:00] grace because God gave him grace. We are
[1:19:03] here. Are you
[1:19:05] here? I can't hear El tabernacle.
[1:19:08] [Music]
[1:19:16] Hallelujah. Grace has come our way.
[1:19:19] [Music]
[1:19:21] And we want to say thank you to the
[1:19:22] Lord.
[1:19:27] It's quiet all over.
[1:19:30] The message, the internet,
[1:19:33] the preaching, the moving of the spirit
[1:19:37] has gone quiet all over and it's getting
[1:19:40] quieter.
[1:19:43] But in El Tabernacle, there's a man
[1:19:53] [Music]
[1:19:55] [Applause]
[1:20:06] Now in the book of Genesis, I'm not
[1:20:08] going to be long. I pastor Jude will be
[1:20:10] come after me
[1:20:11] [Music]
[1:20:13] today.
[1:20:15] And while I'm on that
[1:20:18] point, he asked tomorrow to preach for
[1:20:21] his father. So, we'll be broadcasting
[1:20:24] tomorrow cuz it's our father.
[1:20:29] [Applause]
[1:20:31] [Music]
[1:20:35] Amen. Although there's many rostals
[1:20:38] around, but at least it's our father.
[1:20:43] [Music]
[1:21:00] Hallelujah.
[1:21:02] [Music]
[1:21:09] Hallelujah. Before I finish up,
[1:21:12] Pastor Paul made a wish to the man of
[1:21:15] God.
[1:21:17] And he said that at
[1:21:20] the latter time he brother Bam say he'll
[1:21:24] choose to come to the earth to help
[1:21:27] God's people.
[1:21:29] I feel we already
[1:21:31] helped why why
[1:21:36] why the god man gave you the greatest
[1:21:39] thing that any man could give
[1:21:41] you. The greatest thing in the world he
[1:21:45] gave to our
[1:21:47] tabernacle. Can you tell me what is that
[1:21:50] gift that he
[1:21:51] gave? So if he has given you the Holy
[1:21:55] Ghost, you can't give him a greater gift
[1:21:59] back. You receive the greatest
[1:22:04] [Music]
[1:22:08] gift. Hallelujah. And I was
[1:22:12] thinking in the book of Genesis, there
[1:22:15] was a man whose name started with a E.
[1:22:20] He was the seventh from
[1:22:22] Adam. And it was in the book of
[1:22:25] Genesis. There was a man whose name
[1:22:28] started with an
[1:22:32] E. And the Bible says this man walked
[1:22:35] with God.
[1:22:37] [Applause]
[1:22:39] And when I heard them sing that
[1:22:42] song, I can't even walk unless he holds
[1:22:45] my hand. I realized God has another
[1:22:49] man whose name starts with an E and he
[1:22:54] walks with God.
[1:22:56] [Applause]
[1:22:57] [Music]
[1:22:59] [Applause]
[1:22:59] [Music]
[1:23:01] [Applause]
[1:23:03] [Music]
[1:23:13] My father flies
[1:23:15] pigeons and he can see every bird in the
[1:23:18] kit at his
[1:23:20] age without glasses.
[1:23:24] I can't see who's behind in the church,
[1:23:27] but those dove
[1:23:31] eyes still
[1:23:33] sees better than his son's
[1:23:36] [Music]
[1:23:41] [Applause]
[1:23:47] eyes. And Enoch walked with God and he
[1:23:51] was
[1:23:52] not. that I believe in Revelations
[1:23:56] 10, there's another man with a
[1:23:59] ear. Revelations
[1:24:02] 10:8 and he also walks with God.
[1:24:06] Pray for the man of
[1:24:09] God. Love him
[1:24:13] more. Appreciate him
[1:24:17] more. Do what he
[1:24:20] says. And like he said, don't follow
[1:24:24] us. Follow that
[1:24:27] dove. Happy birthday to you, my
[1:24:30] father. I really love you.
[1:24:34] You've been more than a father to me.
[1:24:39] And thanks for coming every time for my
[1:24:42] soul. I'm a preacher today because he
[1:24:46] allowed me to keep his
[1:24:51] mic. This will never be my mic, but my
[1:24:55] father allowed me as a preacher to keep
[1:24:58] his mic.
[1:25:00] We love you pastor
[1:25:04] Apostle and we
[1:25:07] know that we'll understand it in the by
[1:25:09] and
[1:25:10] by you. Many a day wanted to leave this
[1:25:14] church but you are back here this
[1:25:17] afternoon. There's something in this
[1:25:20] place that's holding the reigns. May God
[1:25:24] bless you. Happy birthday daddy. God
[1:25:27] bless you. Amen.
[1:25:32] [Music]
[1:25:34] [Applause]
[1:25:41] We can do much better than that,
[1:25:45] church. Thank you, Pastor Jonathan
[1:25:49] Ross. Let's give him a shout.
[1:25:53] Hallelujah.
[1:25:55] While we
[1:25:56] welcome our precious pastor, Jude Rosco,
[1:25:59] let's give him a mighty, mighty, mighty
[1:26:01] hand.
[1:26:02] [Music]
[1:26:08] [Applause]
[1:26:11] [Music]
[1:26:22] [Applause]
[1:26:25] [Music]
[1:26:42] We greet each one in the name of the
[1:26:45] Lord this afternoon.
[1:26:49] [Applause]
[1:26:57] God is so good to us
[1:27:02] that he sent a gift our way in this
[1:27:04] hour.
[1:27:08] [Applause]
[1:27:18] And so what's so nice, he made the
[1:27:22] 21st of March a
[1:27:25] holiday so that we could be here this
[1:27:29] afternoon.
[1:27:32] [Music]
[1:27:38] [Music]
[1:27:39] [Applause]
[1:27:41] In 1946,
[1:27:44] on
[1:27:45] 21st of
[1:27:47] March, God brought a gift to the
[1:27:50] [Music]
[1:27:52] earth to help you and to help me. Amen.
[1:28:05] And the amazing thing is we are still
[1:28:09] very happy that God's gift is still with
[1:28:13] us.
[1:28:14] Amen. And leading us on. Amen.
[1:28:18] [Applause]
[1:28:26] [Music]
[1:28:27] I told the apostle in the
[1:28:31] week I met him at Mall of the South by
[1:28:34] chance. I said I
[1:28:37] the the fasting day I listened to
[1:28:40] silence part two.
[1:28:43] I said even if somebody could have those
[1:28:47] notes they wouldn't be able to preach it
[1:28:50] like that.
[1:28:51] Even if you listen to it and try to copy
[1:28:55] it, you won't be able to preach it like
[1:28:58] that. It was meant to come out of one
[1:29:01] man's lips.
[1:29:03] [Music]
[1:29:04] [Applause]
[1:29:12] Hallelujah.
[1:29:15] [Applause]
[1:29:22] Hallelujah.
[1:29:26] And what's so heavy is the anointing on
[1:29:29] those messages.
[1:29:31] [Applause]
[1:29:35] No matter how you
[1:29:36] feel when you put it
[1:29:39] on, devils and demons runs. Amen.
[1:29:45] [Applause]
[1:29:52] That's why I say like Pastor John, it's
[1:29:54] an honor to say
[1:29:57] [Applause]
[1:30:02] something at our apostles birthday.
[1:30:06] You don't know what to say. Words like
[1:30:08] Pastor John says fails you.
[1:30:12] There's so many things to say.
[1:30:15] And uh I think sometimes words doesn't
[1:30:19] make justice
[1:30:22] to
[1:30:23] what has been put in to this ministry.
[1:30:28] [Applause]
[1:30:40] And uh I always wondered what my mother
[1:30:43] meant when she said, "You know, Edgar,
[1:30:45] me and you, we die with our boots on."
[1:30:50] Hallelujah.
[1:30:52] We work
[1:30:54] until we die.
[1:31:07] And it was so funny when she was in the
[1:31:09] accident and thrown out of the car, her
[1:31:13] shoes still stayed on her feet.
[1:31:16] She was trying to tell us, "I died with
[1:31:18] my boots on."
[1:31:23] Amen. And I want to tell her on the
[1:31:26] other
[1:31:27] side, my father still got his boots on.
[1:31:44] We
[1:31:49] we don't wish him anything
[1:31:53] because
[1:31:55] he already has what we want to wish him
[1:31:58] for. Amen.
[1:32:02] [Applause]
[1:32:14] I just want to
[1:32:15] read two
[1:32:18] scriptures. Psalms 90 verse 10.
[1:32:23] The days of our years are three score
[1:32:26] and three score years and
[1:32:29] 10 that 70 is allotted to
[1:32:32] men. And if by reason of strength they
[1:32:36] be four score
[1:32:37] years even they four score years 80
[1:32:40] years.
[1:32:43] The Bible says yet is their strength
[1:32:47] labor and sorrows.
[1:32:52] When the apostle reached 70, we thought
[1:32:54] it will be smooth sailing.
[1:32:58] But even if him living up till
[1:33:02] now, it came with
[1:33:04] labor and it came with sorrows.
[1:33:17] But I thank God that it's
[1:33:19] Revelations 10:8.
[1:33:22] Sweet in your mouth, butter in your
[1:33:26] belly. But what I like of our
[1:33:31] apostl, he doesn't care about the
[1:33:34] bitterness. He concentrates on the
[1:33:36] sweetness. Amen.
[1:33:50] And I can say that song is fulfilled in
[1:33:52] his life.
[1:33:54] We'll work until Jesus come. We'll
[1:34:01] work until he
[1:34:04] comes. The apostle is working. Amen. And
[1:34:08] we appreciate him for that.
[1:34:09] Amen. That's why we are here this
[1:34:13] afternoon to come and
[1:34:16] celebrate his birthday.
[1:34:19] [Applause]
[1:34:25] Amen. That's
[1:34:28] why I'm nearly there. Zechariah 4:7
[1:34:32] says, verse 6 says, "Then he answered
[1:34:36] and spake unto me, saying, this is the
[1:34:39] word of the Lord unto
[1:34:41] Jerubabel, saying, not by might, nor by
[1:34:45] power, but my spirit, say the Lord of
[1:34:49] hosts." He never came with might. He
[1:34:52] never came with
[1:34:54] power. But this apostle came with the
[1:34:56] baptism of the Holy Ghost.
[1:35:01] You don't overcome by power. You don't
[1:35:03] overcome by
[1:35:05] might. God says, "Not by power, not by
[1:35:08] might, but by my my spirit, says the
[1:35:11] Lord of hosts."
[1:35:13] [Applause]
[1:35:19] Amen. And the spirit did come and the
[1:35:22] Holy Ghost did fall. Hallelujah. Here's
[1:35:25] the Here's the witnesses.
[1:35:28] Each flag the Holy Ghost fell in every
[1:35:30] country. Amen. Over 40 countries the
[1:35:34] Holy Ghost did come.
[1:35:41] [Applause]
[1:35:46] Who art thou, oh great mountain, before
[1:35:49] Jerubabel? Thou shalt become a plain,
[1:35:52] and he shall bring forth a headstone
[1:35:54] thereof with shoutings, crying, grace,
[1:35:56] grace. Oh hallelujah. I thank God that
[1:35:59] the headstone came spring grace grace
[1:36:03] the mercy seat. Amen. For you and for
[1:36:08] [Applause]
[1:36:13] me.
[1:36:15] Grace. Grace already came.
[1:36:19] But we have double grace.
[1:36:26] If a man lives after 70, it's grace. If
[1:36:32] he lives to 75, it's grace. If he lives
[1:36:36] beyond 75, it's double grace because
[1:36:40] grace is number
[1:36:42] five. Five and five. Amen. That's why we
[1:36:47] thank God that the
[1:36:49] headstone cried grace, grace to El
[1:36:52] Tabernacle.
[1:36:55] [Applause]
[1:37:05] That's why we
[1:37:07] say
[1:37:10] apostle age is simply the number of
[1:37:14] years
[1:37:17] that the world has been enjoying you. We
[1:37:21] have been enjoying you. The world has
[1:37:24] been enjoying you for 79
[1:37:28] years. El tabernacle. Have you been
[1:37:34] enjoying God's apostle?
[1:37:36] [Music]
[1:37:37] [Applause]
[1:37:44] Amen. You might be enjoying him for 20
[1:37:47] years, 30 years, 40 years.
[1:37:50] But before that some people has been
[1:37:52] enjoying him for the his young age
[1:37:55] and all the world has enjoyed him for
[1:37:59] all these years. Amen.
[1:38:03] [Applause]
[1:38:12] Hallelujah.
[1:38:16] As the CRS leader comes up. Amen.
[1:38:23] Getting old
[1:38:25] is like climbing a mountain.
[1:38:29] Hallelujah. I thank God that this man
[1:38:31] was climbing permit mountain.
[1:38:34] [Applause]
[1:38:35] [Music]
[1:38:39] Hallelujah.
[1:38:40] [Applause]
[1:38:47] The older he got, the higher he climbed,
[1:38:53] the wiser he
[1:38:56] became. The higher he climbed, the
[1:39:00] further he
[1:39:03] saw. The higher he went up the tower,
[1:39:07] the further he could see.
[1:39:10] Amen. Hallelujah. Can you say amen? Y
[1:39:13] tabernacle. Can you say praise the Lord?
[1:39:16] Y tabernacle.
[1:39:17] [Applause]
[1:39:28] The older he got, he must have got out
[1:39:31] of breath. The higher he went.
[1:39:36] [Applause]
[1:39:38] The higher he went, the slower he might
[1:39:40] have gone, but as long as he went
[1:39:46] [Applause]
[1:39:50] higher. The higher the eagle goes, the
[1:39:53] further he
[1:39:54] [Music]
[1:39:57] sees. At 79, we want to tell the devil,
[1:40:01] he went higher
[1:40:03] and he looked further.
[1:40:07] [Applause]
[1:40:08] [Music]
[1:40:13] The higher you go, the better the view
[1:40:16] is. And we want to say, Apostle, enjoy
[1:40:19] the
[1:40:21] view. Apostle, tell us what's going on
[1:40:24] on the other side. The further you
[1:40:27] see, Apostle, tell us what's going to
[1:40:30] happen.
[1:40:32] the higher you
[1:40:33] [Music]
[1:40:35] go.
[1:40:37] Daddy, we love you. We appreciate you.
[1:40:42] We thank you for all your
[1:40:44] labors. We thank you, Lord, for not
[1:40:47] giving up on us and fighting the fight.
[1:40:51] [Music]
[1:41:01] [Applause]

[1:41:08] [Music]
[1:41:09] [Applause]

[1:41:31] Take us with you.
[1:41:33] Pull us with you higher and higher. God
[1:41:38] bless you.
[1:41:42] Amen.
[1:41:45] Oh.
[1:41:48] Hallelujah.
[1:41:50] Hallelujah. Don't you appreciate Pastor
[1:41:53] Jun
[1:41:55] Rosco? No, we can do better than that.
[1:41:58] [Applause]
[1:41:58] [Music]
[1:42:01] just for a short while just give him
[1:42:06] thanks. Thank you
[1:42:09] Lord. Thank you
[1:42:10] [Music]
[1:42:15] Lord. Thank you for our pastor
[1:42:19] Lord. Thank you for keeping him
[1:42:22] Lord. Hallelujah.
[1:42:29] Oh, happy birthday, my
[1:42:32] apostle. There's a lady, a special lady
[1:42:35] that we would like to
[1:42:36] call the granddaughter of the
[1:42:40] apostle, the daughter of our senior
[1:42:42] pastor, Jonathan Rosco, Sister
[1:42:46] Esther. If she can
[1:42:50] come, let's give her a wonderful warm
[1:42:52] hand.
[1:42:54] [Applause]
[1:43:04] God bless you
[1:43:06] saints. We are gathered here today to
[1:43:09] honor a truly special man, a true man of
[1:43:12] God, a legend.
[1:43:15] A
[1:43:18] man, a man known in the heavens and
[1:43:22] known around this world.
[1:43:30] On behalf of the Rosco grandchildren,
[1:43:33] I'm truly honored as your first
[1:43:35] granddaughter to deliver a speech to our
[1:43:39] phenomenal grandfather.
[1:43:41] Today we the grandchildren have hearts
[1:43:44] full of gratitude for a man who has not
[1:43:48] only been our grandfather but also our
[1:43:51] apostle who has been a guiding
[1:43:54] light and a pillar of strength in our
[1:43:58] lives. Our grandfather is not just any
[1:44:01] man. He's a man of God. A true shepherd.
[1:44:11] A true shepherd who has dedicated his
[1:44:13] entire life to preaching the gospel,
[1:44:16] leading his flock and living out the
[1:44:19] word with unwavering faith and
[1:44:25] dedication. Through his sermons and his
[1:44:29] prayers and most importantly his
[1:44:31] example, he has shown us what it means
[1:44:34] to walk with God.
[1:44:36] The Bible says in Proverbs
[1:44:39] 13:22, "A good man leaveth an
[1:44:42] inheritance to his children's
[1:44:45] children." Many measure inheritance in
[1:44:49] material wealth. But our grandfather has
[1:44:52] given us something far greater. The
[1:44:55] inheritance of the Holy Ghost, the good
[1:44:58] news.
[1:45:04] He has shown us that the greatest gift a
[1:45:07] man can pass down is not riches, but a
[1:45:10] life rooted in Christ. A legacy of faith
[1:45:14] and the power of the Holy Spirit working
[1:45:16] within
[1:45:22] us. Growing up under his influence has
[1:45:26] been a blessing beyond measure. His
[1:45:29] wisdom has shaped us. His prayers
[1:45:31] covered us. His love has given us
[1:45:34] strength to live each day with God on
[1:45:36] our side. Whether through a kind word, a
[1:45:40] firm lesson, or a simple moment of
[1:45:43] laughter, he has always reminded us that
[1:45:45] faith in God is not just something we
[1:45:48] speak about, but something we live by.
[1:45:52] Grandpa, your life has been a testimony
[1:45:55] of faithfulness,
[1:45:57] perseverance, unwavering trust in the
[1:45:59] Lord. You have taught us that no matter
[1:46:02] how difficult the journey, God is always
[1:46:04] in control, you have shown us what it
[1:46:07] means to serve with
[1:46:14] humility, love without conditions, and
[1:46:17] lead with a heart full of grace. Our
[1:46:20] family is blessed with many cherished
[1:46:23] testimonies that continue to deepen our
[1:46:26] faith in this great, glorious ministry.
[1:46:30] I too have a testimony. after countless
[1:46:34] persons to a few doctors. It was only
[1:46:37] through your prayers, grandpa, that
[1:46:41] opened my womb, leaving doctors confused
[1:46:45] and
[1:46:46] amazed, that I suddenly got to
[1:46:49] [Applause]
[1:46:52] [Music]
[1:46:53] [Applause]
[1:46:55] [Music]
[1:46:56] [Applause]
[1:46:59] see. And for that, I'm so thankful,
[1:47:02] Grandpa. All as a daily reminder that
[1:47:05] God can do miracles.
[1:47:08] [Music]
[1:47:09] The power of God has moved throughout
[1:47:12] our lives, each and every one of us in
[1:47:16] this family, pinpointing to the fact
[1:47:19] that God truly walks with you, grandpa.
[1:47:21] And we cannot deny it.
[1:47:25] [Applause]
[1:47:29] [Music]
[1:47:35] On behalf of all your grandchildren, we
[1:47:37] want to say thank you. Thank you for
[1:47:40] always thinking of us, your
[1:47:43] grandchildren. Thank you for this great
[1:47:45] and glorious ministry you've built.
[1:47:48] Thank you for building a school, a safe
[1:47:51] haven that molded us. Thank you for all
[1:47:54] the praise that is keeping us for your
[1:47:58] wisdom, for your love and for
[1:48:02] your and for your spiritual legacy you
[1:48:06] have given us. All we have is because of
[1:48:09] you grandpa. We are proud to be your
[1:48:12] grandchildren and we pray that God
[1:48:15] continues to bless you with strength,
[1:48:17] good health, and the joy in the Holy
[1:48:20] Ghost. The 79th
[1:48:23] birthday, thank you for everything,
[1:48:26] Grandpa. No amount of words or
[1:48:30] actions will truly describe what you
[1:48:33] mean to us. It's because of you that we
[1:48:36] can be who we the people we are today.
[1:48:39] We love you, Grandpa. We salute you. May
[1:48:43] God bless you abundantly and may you
[1:48:45] enjoy your special day with love from
[1:48:48] your grandchildren. God bless.
[1:48:58] [Music]
[1:49:14] I know you
[1:49:17] well, but you can't lie to me with all
[1:49:21] those spoken words you don't
[1:49:28] let. I'm not trying to follow you to the
[1:49:32] end of the
[1:49:35] world. I'm just trying to leave
[1:49:37] something
[1:49:39] behind in the footprints of Jesus in
[1:49:44] [Music]
[1:49:46] God. Words have come from man no
[1:49:52] Bible. Oh, but I can't help thinking
[1:49:55] that I heard the wrong crowd.
[1:50:00] When the Holy Ghost is gone, my job will
[1:50:03] be
[1:50:05] true. And I'm trying to leave something
[1:50:10] behind in the foot of Jesus.
[1:50:17] Oh, the money is free and the
[1:50:23] holy smoking
[1:50:37] [Music]
[1:50:44] [Music]
[1:50:48] behind in the forest of
[1:50:54] Jesus. This whole world is a
[1:51:00] war. We swallow the moon, but we don't
[1:51:04] know why.
[1:51:09] the case but we
[1:51:13] know I'm trying to
