[1:31:25] We thought it's going to be seven days.
[1:31:27] It was not seven days.
[1:31:30] &gt;&gt; So, I'm glad everybody made it back.
[1:31:36] And it's that time of the year where we

[1:32:10] I want to thank God
[1:32:14] um
[1:32:16] for the year.
[1:32:19] We want to thank all the preachers who
[1:32:21] have serviced El Tabernacle this year.
[1:32:25] We just didn't forget you. Amen.
[1:32:29] every sermon preached,
[1:32:32] every sweat that fell from your face.
[1:32:36] We want to thank every preacher that
[1:32:40] left your families many a day just to go
[1:32:43] out and
[1:32:45] feed God's people. Can we just give them
[1:32:48] a hand?
[1:32:56] I think you can do better than than
[1:32:59] that.
[1:33:07] Amen.
[1:33:09] The reason being if the preacher didn't
[1:33:12] come, we would have to close the meeting
[1:33:15] in prayer and you go home. But they do
[1:33:18] come. Amen. Every week and every
[1:33:21] service.
[1:33:22] So we give them
[1:33:27] may God bless them, inspire them and
[1:33:30] pray for them. Amen. It's not easy.
[1:33:32] Amen.

[1:33:51] that preached like no other this year
[1:33:56] that gave everything till Richmond and
[1:33:59] the convention and tonight.
[1:34:03] You ought to give him a hand tonight.
[1:34:18] Amen. Can you do it again?
[1:34:24] We used to sing a song. He didn't have
[1:34:27] to do it, but he did.
[1:34:32] And we promise apostle tonight when God
[1:34:35] speaks,
[1:34:38] let this church say, "Amen."
[1:34:45] &gt;&gt; We appreciate the apostle.
[1:34:50] &gt;&gt; It's definitely God that done it all for
[1:34:53] us.
[1:34:56] And we are eternally grateful for him,
[1:34:59] his vision, this place and every service
[1:35:03] and sermon he preached to to us.
[1:35:11] May God bless his servant tonight. Amen.
[1:35:20] Then um after this I would like to thank
[1:35:23] every elder
[1:35:26] who's done a splendid job. They work
[1:35:29] these brothers. I know whoever is sick.
[1:35:33] They pray for them. They they they they
[1:35:36] go out of their way to service the
[1:35:39] problems on the table of our tabernacle.
[1:35:43] We appreciate
[1:35:45] this year every person you prayed for
[1:35:48] and we want to thank God for healing
[1:35:51] everyone you prayed for. Some of them
[1:35:54] are in church tonight because God
[1:35:57] anoints the elders when you are sick to
[1:35:59] pray for you.
[1:36:03] Let's just give God's elders a hand.
[1:36:08] [applause]

[1:36:12] communion for us
[1:36:15] and they take care of the baptism
[1:36:17] candidates. Amen.
[1:36:19] &gt;&gt; And they do a good job and they got
[1:36:22] lists to confirm their work. Continue in
[1:36:25] the new year and God will bless you.
[1:36:28] Amen.
[1:36:35] We want to thank the deacons for
[1:36:36] standing on their post of duty.
[1:36:44] keeping the order of the church as
[1:36:46] usual.
[1:36:48] May you continue to be on your point of
[1:36:50] duty and thank you for 2025.
[1:36:54] Every case,
[1:36:57] every weak one
[1:36:59] and every nappy you had to clean that
[1:37:01] was dirty. The people are here with
[1:37:04] clean nappies because you went out to
[1:37:07] clean their nappies. Amen. Some people
[1:37:09] are in church.
[1:37:12] Amen. Let me give the deacons.
[1:37:16] Oh, good. And I know you some people
[1:37:18] don't like the deacons, but we love the
[1:37:21] deacons. We don't like them. We love
[1:37:22] them. Amen. For knocking on our door.
[1:37:25] Amen.
[1:37:35] Then we want to come to not the last
[1:37:37] group actually the first group but the
[1:37:39] last group here is the treasurers and
[1:37:42] the trustees.
[1:37:49] Oh my
[1:37:51] did they feed us well at this
[1:37:54] convention.
[1:37:56] [cheering and applause]
[1:37:59] I know sisters they don't cook at home
[1:38:02] but when they cook for this woman I we
[1:38:05] enjoyed every
[1:38:07] meal and every effort you put in and
[1:38:11] whatever you've done this whole year
[1:38:15] Sunday in Sunday out. Can we give them a
[1:38:17] hand?
[1:38:27] They tried to meet our every need
[1:38:31] and we are grateful to for them. Amen.
[1:38:36] Then um this year we want to thank the
[1:38:40] sponsors of the funday.
[1:38:46] We made it
[1:38:49] our tabernacle. We made it.
[1:38:53] [applause]
[1:38:54] And did we have a lot of fun days? Amen.
[1:38:58] But we made it
[1:39:06] before Easter
[1:39:09] right until now with your wives. The
[1:39:14] dedication of every person that tried to
[1:39:16] give something to make every event a
[1:39:20] success. And there wasn't one that
[1:39:22] wasn't a success. But because of your
[1:39:26] inputs, may God richly bless you.
[1:39:34] [applause] And with the sponsors,
[1:39:37] we will try before the dedication to go
[1:39:39] down to Derban.
[1:39:45] I mean, it's only fair. Some people
[1:39:48] really dug deep and we will try before
[1:39:52] the f before the dedication service for
[1:39:55] all of you with your wives to go down to
[1:39:57] Durban before the dedication.
[1:40:01] I can't think how many sponsors but we
[1:40:04] will check it out. Donations made it
[1:40:07] possible.
[1:40:14] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[1:40:19] &gt;&gt; We thank God for the successful
[1:40:21] tournaments,
[1:40:23] the joy it brings to our children.
[1:40:26] Money cannot buy that.
[1:40:34] [applause]
[1:40:35] Even the old people that are children
[1:40:37] that wanted to that played, it brought
[1:40:40] joy to us and we thank God for making it
[1:40:44] a success. and everybody that
[1:40:47] contributed their time, effort, energy
[1:40:52] to make this a success.
[1:40:57] [music]
[1:41:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:12] &gt;&gt; You're looking at me like you know
[1:41:14] what's on this list. Amen.
[1:41:17] Then again, we want to thank God for
[1:41:19] this wonderful occasions we had with the
[1:41:23] woman's day.
[1:41:29] I've never seen people so excited like
[1:41:31] that day. What a success.
[1:41:40] And to you that was not at the men's
[1:41:43] camp,
[1:41:44] get that quote or that clip. It will
[1:41:47] help you. You've never heard things like
[1:41:50] we heard at that man's camp.
[1:41:57] &gt;&gt; Let's just give a God's apostle a hand.
[1:42:00] Amen.
[1:42:06] &gt;&gt; [music]
[1:42:17] &gt;&gt; Then um I don't know if you remember I
[1:42:21] don't know if you forgot we had a
[1:42:23] concert here. I don't know if you
[1:42:25] remember
[1:42:31] highly successful
[1:42:34] And the apostle says,
[1:42:37] "Looking forward for another one in
[1:42:40] 2026." In a few hours when we eat 20,
[1:42:43] he's looking forward to another one.
[1:42:55] The sisters that cook the whole year
[1:42:58] and for the special meetings. There are
[1:43:01] people here that do things that you
[1:43:02] don't know. They slip here on the side
[1:43:05] and they cook and they move. All that
[1:43:09] you do, you eat. You don't know who they
[1:43:11] are that cooked for you.
[1:43:14] Give them a hand. Amen.
[1:43:27] Special meetings all over. We went, food
[1:43:30] was provided.
[1:43:32] We were in Richmond. They had food
[1:43:35] provided.
[1:43:39] Short notice, but people are on the
[1:43:42] ball.
[1:43:43] People want to do something.
[1:43:51] Then again, this year, I don't know
[1:43:54] about you, El Tabernacle, but these
[1:43:56] media guys on the cameras,
[1:43:59] they took us to another level.
[1:44:03] I don't know if you see the clips and
[1:44:04] the videos and the preaching. It's on
[1:44:07] another level. Can we stand up and give
[1:44:11] them a hand?
[1:44:13] And the reason why I want you to stand
[1:44:15] up and give them a hand, they travel the
[1:44:17] country to record the man of God.
[1:44:26] And the reason you need to give them a
[1:44:28] hand, it's easy to buy data
[1:44:32] to look it on your coach than to travel
[1:44:36] to the real live meeting. They make it
[1:44:39] possible for you to relax and watch it
[1:44:42] at home. Give them a hand.
[1:44:53] Give them a hand.
[1:44:56] [music]
[1:45:00] And they're doing such a good job that
[1:45:03] every so-cal message Pentecostal is on
[1:45:08] our stream because they doing a good
[1:45:11] job.
[1:45:16] Edgar and Edgar and the people behind
[1:45:19] it. Amen. They doing a good job.
[1:45:28] My father says they're just special.
[1:45:34] &gt;&gt; Servicing the whole world. Apostle says
[1:45:36] they servicing the whole world. Keeping
[1:45:39] the voice in this church alive.
[1:45:44] God's voice alive.
[1:45:57] Then we want to thank brother Israel,
[1:46:00] brother Daniel, brother Lost,
[1:46:03] all the L tabernacle worers
[1:46:07] that work in the unseen every time to
[1:46:10] keep us going here.
[1:46:14] Can we give them a hand?
[1:46:17] [music]
[1:46:18] Can you give them a hand?
[1:46:28] I'm out of cater out of notes but use a
[1:46:31] spoiled man.
[1:46:35] Yellow man says kabad.
[1:46:45] You need to get one of those message
[1:46:46] pastors and you'll see what it is what
[1:46:48] you have.
[1:46:54] Let's give the man on the tower a hand.
[1:47:02] It's not just running this place. Having
[1:47:05] a vision for this place every time takes
[1:47:08] a special man.
[1:47:29] &gt;&gt; [music]
[1:47:34] [applause]
[1:47:36] &gt;&gt; Don't get happy for a man
[1:47:40] and run after a man here. Any man in the
[1:47:42] church. Look who anointing that man.
[1:47:48] &gt;&gt; There's a man anointing people here.
[1:47:53] [applause]
[1:48:00] Then we want to thank the school. It's
[1:48:03] still standing. You know you here but
[1:48:06] the whole year there's people on the
[1:48:08] sides here. A school every day every
[1:48:12] year since we started the school is
[1:48:15] still here.
[1:48:19] Not God in the prison only. God in the
[1:48:22] school.
[1:48:24] &gt;&gt; [cheering]
[1:48:30] &gt;&gt; We want to thank the principal, the vice
[1:48:32] principal, the teachers, and every
[1:48:35] worker here. They work every day to keep
[1:48:40] the school going.
[1:48:42] And you know how many made it because of
[1:48:45] this El Tabernacle.
[1:48:48] We gave up on the school, but God did
[1:48:50] not give up on. And by God's grace,
[1:48:53] we're going to open up again 2026.
[1:49:03] You want to give the teachers a good
[1:49:05] applause.
[1:49:07] Your regret, your reward is great
[1:49:19] from the school, the family, everyone.
[1:49:22] The school was never in a better
[1:49:24] financial place like now.
[1:49:36] Going into 2026, we were never all right
[1:49:40] with the school like now because God is
[1:49:42] in the school.
[1:49:45] &gt;&gt; Whatever this man,
[1:49:51] fruit comes.
[1:49:54] Forgive me, church,
[1:49:56] but I like the truth.
[1:50:00] And if you don't believe it, look at his
[1:50:02] fruit and worship the fruit.
[1:50:08] By the end of this year, we'll be able
[1:50:10] to give a full financial report of what
[1:50:13] God done in his school. God got a
[1:50:16] school.
[1:50:20] [cheering]
[1:50:22] &gt;&gt; I don't know if you remember, but God's
[1:50:25] got a school.
[1:50:29] El Tabernacle. God's got to school.
[1:50:34] And both my kids made it years ago
[1:50:37] because God had a school.
[1:50:41] [music]
[1:50:43] I don't think Edgar and Esther turned
[1:50:44] out very bad. They wouldn't have made it
[1:50:47] if God didn't have a school.
[1:50:50] Jal and Joel wouldn't have made God had
[1:50:54] a school.
[1:50:57] All the grandchildren made it because
[1:50:59] God had a school.
[1:51:03] &gt;&gt; Thanks the teachers. Thank the
[1:51:05] principal. And behind that, thank the
[1:51:08] God of the apostle.
[1:51:10] The apostle saw it through for us. Thank
[1:51:14] you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
[1:51:16] Thank you. [music]
[1:51:39] through that school and everything. Be
[1:51:42] patient with Edgar Roscoll.
[1:51:45] &gt;&gt; Be patient with him.
[1:51:48] &gt;&gt; All is well on our way. We are well on
[1:51:51] our way
[1:51:58] that apostle.
[1:52:00] We want to thank King Jesus
[1:52:03] for the bonuses we gave all the workers
[1:52:05] and teachers this year. We could bless
[1:52:08] them more than any year. [music]
[1:52:11] Everyone that is from Y tabernet
[1:52:15] the companies didn't give bonuses that
[1:52:18] most companies didn't give a year end
[1:52:20] function
[1:52:22] but God in El Tabernacle in a man in a
[1:52:26] in the leader of this
[1:52:29] blessed you
[1:52:32] though times are hard he blessed you
[1:52:35] he didn't have to do it but he did thank
[1:52:39] you king Jesus Yes,
[1:52:47] we thank God we could
[1:52:50] some places we lifted up the bonuses by
[1:52:53] 2,000 rain. We gave more than any year
[1:52:57] in the worst time.
[1:53:00] Is God here?
[1:53:03] &gt;&gt; Are you pressing stop?
[1:53:05] &gt;&gt; But God is pressing play. [cheering]
[1:53:12] That's why whoever wants to stop it will
[1:53:15] take the remote out and keep it playing.
[1:53:21] [applause]
[1:53:26] &gt;&gt; El tabernacle don't say leadership. We
[1:53:29] got leadership.
[1:53:38] And brother, the lifting up is just the
[1:53:40] natural side. How many people was lifted
[1:53:43] up spiritually this year
[1:53:45] &gt;&gt; that you can't even talk of?
[1:53:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:53:51] [music]
[1:53:57] And then for the first time this year
[1:54:01] &gt;&gt; or in the in this year especially the
[1:54:05] people from far cleaned this place not
[1:54:09] as visitors.
[1:54:12] &gt;&gt; They slept here not as visitors.
[1:54:16] They cleaned the hostels and wherever
[1:54:18] they were the yard, the kitchen not as
[1:54:20] visitors. They told us now we are El
[1:54:24] Tabernacle.
[1:54:29] Let's give them a hand. It's clean
[1:54:32] around here
[1:54:34] because people feel that this is their
[1:54:36] place.
[1:54:44] I'm almost done.
[1:54:47] Hallelujah.
[1:54:48] &gt;&gt; Then at this time I would like to
[1:54:50] where's brother Lloyd
[1:54:52] Ptorius.
[1:54:56] &gt;&gt; I don't see him. He's here.
[1:55:00] But we want to wish him happy birthday.
[1:55:07] Then in a few hours, Sister Jasmine,
[1:55:11] happy birthday. The 1st of January.
[1:55:16] Sister Darie, Pastor Edgar's wife, happy
[1:55:19] birthday from the church, the apostle
[1:55:21] and the family. Sister Esther, happy
[1:55:24] birthday. Sister Myra, happy birthday.
[1:55:28] And whoever birthday it is today or
[1:55:31] tomorrow or whatever, happy birthday.
[1:55:36] We are ready
[1:55:38] to receive
[1:55:40] the man of God. Do you appreciate the
[1:55:42] man of God?
[1:55:46] There will never be a thing like this
[1:55:49] ever again.
[1:55:51] Enjoy it, church.
[1:55:54] God bless you.
[1:55:58] [applause]
[1:56:22] Good evening and welcome back to E News
[1:56:24] Network, your trusted [music] source for
[1:56:26] uplifting, inspiring, and informative
[1:56:29] news across Eban.
[1:56:31] I'm Rosanne [music] Adams and tonight
[1:56:33] we're taking a look back and reflecting
[1:56:35] on the year.
[1:56:38] Now, in the 2025 World Cup Roller Fly,
[1:56:42] we saw our local team, the MBRC, make
[1:56:45] its mark with two familiar names flying
[1:56:47] high in the face of adversity.
[1:56:50] Our senior pastor, Jonathan, took to the
[1:56:52] skies with tough winds and recording a
[1:56:55] score of 54.08,
[1:56:57] showing great composure despite the
[1:56:59] unpredictable nature of the outdoor
[1:57:01] competition.
[1:57:03] And then our apostle Edah Hill scored an
[1:57:07] impressive
[1:57:09] 125.58.
[1:57:11] Even under the strong wind conditions,
[1:57:14] the Apostle's performance stood as one
[1:57:16] of the greatest representations of our
[1:57:18] region. Even under difficult weather
[1:57:20] conditions, qualifying him for
[1:57:22] recognition on the world stage.
[1:57:35] I greet you
[1:57:38] um all
[1:57:41] I'm uh my name is Edar
[1:57:44] Rosco
[1:57:46] and um
[1:57:48] I
[1:57:51] have pictures for over 20 is.
[1:58:01] [music]
[1:58:07] [music]
[1:58:20] Now, we witnessed the EHR79 Cup unfold
[1:58:24] across three major tournaments, and the
[1:58:26] finale produced one of the most dramatic
[1:58:28] and intense finishes. At the end of the
[1:58:31] tournament, Shooting Stars and Volcano
[1:58:33] were level on 27 points, forcing the
[1:58:36] championship to be decided by gold
[1:58:38] defense. Shooting Stars, however,
[1:58:41] claimed the title with a superior goal
[1:58:43] difference of 114, narrowly edging out
[1:58:47] volcanoes on 92 points.
[1:58:50] Gunners FC, the reigning champions from
[1:58:53] last year, successfully defended their
[1:58:55] title, finishing the season on 22
[1:58:58] points. Closely behind were Loft House,
[1:59:01] who mounted a strong challenge
[1:59:03] throughout the tournament and ended on
[1:59:05] just two points a drift on 20 points.
[1:59:10] More than the competition, the EHR 79
[1:59:13] Cup stood as a collective sacrifice
[1:59:16] towards the building of the Durban
[1:59:18] Church. Every match played, every point
[1:59:21] scored, and every cheer contributed to
[1:59:23] God's greater plan. Whether winning or
[1:59:26] losing on the field, we are all winners
[1:59:28] in supporting the work of the Lord.
[1:59:40] [music]
[1:59:45] [music]
[1:59:51] &gt;&gt; [music]
[1:59:57] &gt;&gt; The EL1 Racing Championship delivered
[1:59:59] excitement throughout the year, but
[2:00:02] there can only be one champion. Team
[2:00:05] Aston Martin stood victoriously on the
[2:00:07] podium after speeding through their
[2:00:09] final race. In terms of individual
[2:00:12] driver standings, pastor Edgar Karosco
[2:00:14] Jr. claimed the EL1 championship title.
[2:00:18] This season was yet another proud moment
[2:00:20] for Al Tabernacle and a testament to our
[2:00:23] excellence in every arena.
[2:00:32] [music]
[2:00:39] Heat. Heat.
[2:00:45] [music]
[2:01:04] &gt;&gt; [music]
[2:01:15] [music]
[2:01:20] [music]
[2:01:28] &gt;&gt; Beyond Sport 2025 was rich in teaching
[2:01:32] and guiding to our tabernacle. The
[2:01:34] women's seminar provided wisdom,
[2:01:37] encouragement, and practical instruction
[2:01:39] to the ladies of eel tabernacle. While
[2:01:42] the men's camp became a place of
[2:01:43] reflection, accountability, and
[2:01:45] strengthening. Advice given during these
[2:01:48] gatherings addressed family, faith,
[2:01:51] responsibility, and purpose, leaving a
[2:01:53] lasting impact to extend beyond the
[2:01:56] year. was featured.
[2:01:58] The atmosphere was electrifying [music]
[2:02:02] and uplifting.
[2:02:04] What a blessed
[2:02:06] and amazing day we had to tell you all.
[2:02:10] Nothing was outsourced.
[2:02:13] Our speakers, our caterers, our
[2:02:16] florists,
[2:02:17] our decor ladies, everything proudly El
[2:02:21] Tabernacle.
[2:02:25] Not forgetting El Tabernacle's Gospel
[2:02:27] Concert held by our very own mass choir
[2:02:30] and instrumental ensemble. The seasons
[2:02:33] of praise gospel concert celebrated our
[2:02:35] unchanging praise with the changing
[2:02:38] seasons.
[2:02:55] And then at the heart of 2025 was the
[2:02:58] Apostle Ed Rosco who led eel tabernacle
[2:03:02] through a powerful sequence of services
[2:03:04] throughout the year. Our 2025 year began
[2:03:07] with the sermon the mighty angel
[2:03:10] revelations 10:1
[2:03:12] the keystone [music] revelation.
[2:03:14] The apostle then preached at the January
[2:03:16] combined meeting the gospel trumpet has
[2:03:19] sounded part one. On the 2nd of
[2:03:22] February, we heard the apostle preaching
[2:03:24] on the bess and beard comments. The 22nd
[2:03:28] and the 23rd of February, the apostle
[2:03:30] held the Bible study on the depths of
[2:03:33] revelations 10 part 5 all the way in
[2:03:36] Penda. [music]
[2:03:38] On the 1st of March, the apostle
[2:03:40] preached the gospel trumpet has sounded
[2:03:42] part two. During the Easter convention,
[2:03:45] [music] the apostle has preached the
[2:03:48] bride's Easter. And on the 31st of May,
[2:03:51] the Apostle preached part two of the
[2:03:53] bride's Easter. We then heard the
[2:03:56] foolish virgin on the 29th of June. And
[2:04:00] at the funeral of our late elder, the
[2:04:02] apostle preached after the coffin. What
[2:04:06] then? On the 2nd of August, we heard the
[2:04:10] foolish virgin part two. On the 17th of
[2:04:13] August, the apostle preached in Hebron
[2:04:16] the lost anointing. And during that
[2:04:19] August combined meeting, Handlers of the
[2:04:21] Oil was preached. On the 22nd of
[2:04:24] September, Handlers of the Oil part two
[2:04:27] was preached. The greatest sermon ever
[2:04:30] preached, the prophetic insight in
[2:04:32] [music] Matthew 25. The seventh seal was
[2:04:36] preached on the 10th of October.
[2:04:39] During the Bloomfontain services,

[2:20:45] I'm bringing forth
[2:20:48] a confession
[2:20:51] of a murderer.
[2:20:57] I killed a man
[2:21:04] after 60 plus years.
[2:21:09] I had to make this confession tonight.
[2:21:14] I need to repent.
[2:21:19] I call it a confession
[2:21:23] of a murderer.
[2:21:27] And they will never find his body.
[2:21:32] &gt;&gt; The guy
[2:21:36] &gt;&gt; that I killed
[2:21:42] &gt;&gt; while I was 18 to 20 years old.
[2:21:48] I killed a man.
[2:21:51] [applause]
[2:22:00] [applause]
[2:22:02] &gt;&gt; This man
[2:22:04] was water in my blood.
[2:22:08] &gt;&gt; Always against me.
[2:22:13] stood in my way if I wanted to do
[2:22:15] something.
[2:22:20] &gt;&gt; Like Paul says, the copper smid.
[2:22:25] &gt;&gt; This man done me much harm.
[2:22:30] When I was a young when I was young, he
[2:22:33] was my best friend.
[2:22:36] But he made me to dishonor
[2:22:39] my parents.
[2:22:43] You know how
[2:22:45] [clears throat]
[2:22:46] friends go
[2:22:48] when it comes to your parents and what
[2:22:50] your parents want you to be
[2:22:54] and then they have a way to influence
[2:22:57] you
[2:22:58] to dishonor your parents
[2:23:02] &gt;&gt; and disobey [music] your parents.
[2:23:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:23:07] I nearly turned out a juvenile
[2:23:09] delinquent
[2:23:12] because of him.
[2:23:16] I nearly became a renegade,
[2:23:21] disobedient to my parents.
[2:23:25] When we got older,
[2:23:28] he introduced me
[2:23:31] to the wrong company.
[2:23:36] That's why I know
[2:23:42] when I see your friends, I know your
[2:23:45] company
[2:23:47] &gt;&gt; and I know who you are. [applause]
[2:23:56] [music]
[2:23:59] He made me run after goals. I was
[2:24:04] quite a handsome
[2:24:07] young guy.
[2:24:10] [applause]
[2:24:12] I knew how to dress
[2:24:15] [cheering]
[2:24:17] [music]
[2:24:19] [applause]
[2:24:19] and I had them flocking after me.
[2:24:26] Brother Beckard asked me one time him
[2:24:28] and his wife and all those girls that
[2:24:31] was running after you. I said I kissed
[2:24:33] them all
[2:24:36] because of this friend. [applause]
[2:24:46] He introduced me to sport that never
[2:24:50] that nearly took my heart away because I
[2:24:53] nearly went to England.
[2:24:57] I doubt there was a guy that scored as
[2:25:00] many goals as what I have
[2:25:03] and my friend [applause]
[2:25:06] boosted me.
[2:25:11] He took me to the pleasures of the world
[2:25:20] and he drove me from church.
[2:25:27] And I said to myself, "So far, my
[2:25:30] friend."
[2:25:36] Then I came to a place, how can I kill
[2:25:39] this guy?
[2:25:45] I cornered him [applause]
[2:25:47] [music]
[2:25:50] one time. I cornered him,
[2:25:54] Brother Raymond. There was no way out
[2:25:57] for him.
[2:26:00] I planned [music] it to precision.
[2:26:05] at this place. You won't get away.
[2:26:10] I'm going to kill him.
[2:26:18] &gt;&gt; Would you like to know what corner I
[2:26:21] caught him in?
[2:26:26] &gt;&gt; It was at the altar of the Nazarene
[2:26:29] church. [cheering]

[2:26:54] [applause]

[2:26:56] &gt;&gt; The guy couldn't escape.
[2:26:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[2:27:02] &gt;&gt; And I killed him at that altar.
[2:27:05] [cheering and applause]
[2:27:14] [applause]
[2:27:15] &gt;&gt; And you know what I done with his body?
[2:27:19] I took his body and threw it into the
[2:27:22] sea of forgetfulness.
[2:27:25] [cheering]
[2:27:32] &gt;&gt; [cheering]
[2:27:35] [applause]
[2:27:38] &gt;&gt; And they couldn't find his body
[2:27:41] [cheering]
[2:27:44] [applause]
[2:27:45] &gt;&gt; cuz his body is gone.
[2:27:48] [cheering]
[2:27:51] [applause]
[2:27:52] His old life is gone. Christina
[2:27:56] &gt;&gt; [cheering]
[2:27:57] [applause]
[2:28:07] &gt;&gt; Because I hated myself.
[2:28:11] [cheering]
[2:28:11] &gt;&gt; Oh, wretched man that I am.
[2:28:15] [applause]

[2:28:55] Raymond,
[2:28:56] &gt;&gt; he wants to jump up.
[2:28:59] &gt;&gt; And then I die daily.
[2:29:02] &gt;&gt; I kill him daily. [applause]
[2:29:11] [applause]
[2:29:17] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[2:29:19] &gt;&gt; And I was going to ask the church
[2:29:23] as you look at this man behind the
[2:29:25] pulpit,
[2:29:27] &gt;&gt; wouldn't you like to become murderers?
[2:29:30] [cheering]
[2:29:37] [applause]
[2:29:39] [cheering]
[2:29:42] Let us kill ourselves.
[2:29:45] &gt;&gt; [cheering]

[2:35:14] &gt;&gt; I'd like you to say with me again.
[2:35:19] &gt;&gt; Let's say it together.
[2:35:36] again.
[2:35:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:35:51] [applause]
[2:36:00] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[2:36:05] &gt;&gt; What a year we had last year, huh?
[2:36:11] &gt;&gt; I just want to say before going into the
[2:36:13] message,
[2:36:17] I really do not know
[2:36:20] about 2026.
[2:36:23] Amen.
[2:36:27] &gt;&gt; I try to look into it.
[2:36:31] &gt;&gt; I try to see something like normally
[2:36:33] when I come,
[2:36:38] it looks so dumb to me
[2:36:47] because 2025 was based on Trump.
[2:36:59] He had Kalansky at him.
[2:37:02] He had
[2:37:04] most of the presidents visiting him this
[2:37:07] year.
[2:37:10] He had a lot of wars
[2:37:14] that he tries to stop this year.
[2:37:21] And he hardly stops them then they go on
[2:37:23] again.
[2:37:27] He was preaching one gospel
[2:37:31] peace
[2:37:33] &gt;&gt; which is Matthew 24
[2:37:36] &gt;&gt; war was
[2:37:37] which is Matthew 24.
[2:37:45] &gt;&gt; In the meantime he
[2:37:48] caused war somewhere else.
[2:37:54] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[2:38:02] &gt;&gt; He lifted up the taxes
[2:38:05] &gt;&gt; money fail. Amen.
[2:38:18] &gt;&gt; He remind me of that second woman
[2:38:24] &gt;&gt; in the sixth vision
[2:38:27] [applause]
[2:38:28] &gt;&gt; representing Rome.
[2:38:33] Everything he does
[2:38:34] [applause and cheering] thus far
[2:38:40] &gt;&gt; is to do with that sixth vision.
[2:38:50] &gt;&gt; I do not know it looks so bad.
[2:38:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:38:56] that
[2:38:58] 2026
[2:39:02] America will be 250 years old.
[2:39:12] In 2026,
[2:39:15] Israel
[2:39:18] will be 80 years in the in the promised
[2:39:20] land. [applause]
[2:39:30] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[2:39:35] &gt;&gt; Now, I hope I'm not prophesying.
[2:39:40] &gt;&gt; I'm hoping
[2:39:43] that as things look,
[2:39:48] I hope Los Angeles sink.
[2:39:51] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[2:40:01] [applause]
[2:40:01] &gt;&gt; It is about the best time
[2:40:06] &gt;&gt; to sing
[2:40:09] &gt;&gt; because you will have the World Cup
[2:40:12] &gt;&gt; in Los Angeles
[2:40:15] &gt;&gt; next year.
[2:40:18] [cheering]
[2:40:24] So remember, I say I hope.
[2:40:28] [applause]
[2:40:31] &gt;&gt; And if there's anybody here that don't
[2:40:33] hope the way I hope,
[2:40:37] &gt;&gt; then I'm sure you're not ready
[2:40:41] [applause]
[2:40:44] &gt;&gt; to move. [cheering]
[2:40:48] [applause]
[2:40:54] I want to say even so Lord Jesus
[2:40:58] &gt;&gt; let you go.
[2:41:04] [applause and cheering]
[2:41:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:41:09] [applause]
[2:41:09] [cheering]
[2:41:15] It will be two years nearly after the
[2:41:20] 70th Jubilee.
[2:41:32] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[2:41:34] [cheering]
[2:41:41] [applause]
[2:41:42] &gt;&gt; There was a lot of cases
[2:41:48] in 2025.
[2:41:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:41:56] &gt;&gt; They never had such a lot of cases.
[2:41:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:42:07] indictments.
[2:42:10] &gt;&gt; And normally after the indictment come
[2:42:13] the prison
[2:42:16] &gt;&gt; sentence.
[2:42:19] [applause]
[2:42:25] &gt;&gt; Now why I say so? [applause]
[2:42:28] It's because
[2:42:31] when the door was shut
[2:42:35] &gt;&gt; in the time of Sodom,
[2:42:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:42:38] &gt;&gt; Sodom and Gomorrah
[2:42:42] &gt;&gt; had an earthquake.
[2:42:44] [applause]
[2:42:50] [cheering]
[2:42:54] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[2:42:57] &gt;&gt; So friends,
[2:43:02] &gt;&gt; you don't have to even ask your pastor
[2:43:05] about a thing like this.
[2:43:08] &gt;&gt; You got two eyes and you got two ears.
[2:43:12] &gt;&gt; Why don't you start looking around?
[2:43:16] [applause]
[2:43:18] &gt;&gt; [cheering]
[2:43:22] [applause]
[2:43:27] &gt;&gt; And the king of England also wants to
[2:43:29] visit 2025
[2:43:32] &gt;&gt; America.
[2:43:36] And Trump wants to give a big bash.
[2:43:41] And normally
[2:43:43] in the Bible
[2:43:45] when Nebuchadnezzar
[2:43:48] had a [cheering] big bash,
[2:43:51] &gt;&gt; the handwriting
[2:43:54] [cheering] on the wall. [applause]
[2:44:02] [cheering]
[2:44:05] [applause]
[2:44:10] And that's why I chose this title.
[2:44:17] &gt;&gt; And the door is shut.
[2:44:21] [applause]
[2:44:25] [cheering]
[2:44:30] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[2:44:30] [cheering]
[2:44:36] [applause]
[2:44:43] &gt;&gt; When the oil stopped
[2:44:47] and there was no more oil
[2:44:50] &gt;&gt; and there was no more Holy Ghost
[2:44:53] &gt;&gt; and there was no more token. Amen.
[2:45:01] &gt;&gt; These
[2:45:03] foolish virgins,
[2:45:07] &gt;&gt; they knew they didn't have oil.
[2:45:11] [applause]
[2:45:17] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[2:45:24] [applause]
[2:45:25] &gt;&gt; The Bible says
[2:45:28] that they went out
[2:45:31] &gt;&gt; to go look for oil.
[2:45:35] &gt;&gt; And the prophet of those days say when
[2:45:37] they went out they didn't find oil.
[2:45:42] Nowhere in the Bible
[2:45:44] &gt;&gt; does it say they found oil.
[2:45:49] &gt;&gt; Now, why didn't they find oil?
[2:45:53] Is because the wise virgin bought up all
[2:45:55] the oil.
[2:45:57] [applause]
[2:45:58] [cheering]
[2:46:03] [applause]

[2:46:23] she bought oil. every service.
[2:46:28] [cheering]
[2:46:28] [applause]
[2:46:33] She didn't set stone
[2:46:36] [cheering] and let it pass by.
[2:46:39] She grabbed it. [cheering]
[2:46:42] Every service
[2:46:48] and now there is no oil. [cheering]
[2:46:52] [applause]
[2:46:55] Hey,
[2:46:57] [applause]
[2:47:00] [cheering]
[2:47:04] [applause]
[2:47:07] [cheering]
[2:47:09] [applause]
[2:47:13] &gt;&gt; and they ran out to try and go and find
[2:47:16] the oil.
[2:47:18] &gt;&gt; This one runs to that church and preach
[2:47:20] to that pastor.
[2:47:24] to see if he can bring oil to that
[2:47:26] church while his church hasn't got oil.
[2:47:30] How can he go to another church to bring
[2:47:33] oil
[2:47:35] and that pastor go to another pastor?
[2:47:38] They went out.
[2:47:40] Nobody goes out of El Tabernacle.
[2:47:44] We have the oil. The oil here.
[2:47:48] [cheering]
[2:47:50] &gt;&gt; [applause]

[2:48:39] &gt;&gt; [cheering]
[2:48:43] &gt;&gt; And while they running up and down to
[2:48:45] one another's churches
[2:48:47] tried to bring oil in one another's
[2:48:51] churches,
[2:48:52] the Bible says they didn't find the oil
[2:48:56] &gt;&gt; and then the Bible concludes
[2:48:59] &gt;&gt; and the doors was

[2:49:30] &gt;&gt; that was shut for them

[2:51:39] [cheering]
[2:51:39] [applause]
[2:51:41] He don't care which church you belong
[2:51:44] to. If you hunted with brother Brennham
[2:51:47] and you slept with brother Brennham and
[2:51:49] your brother Brennham around every
[2:51:51] corner, if you do not have the oil, he's

[2:53:28] &gt;&gt; the doors were shut.
[2:53:32] &gt;&gt; 7:16, God tells Noah, "Come into the
[2:53:36] ark." That means that God was already in
[2:53:38] the ark.
[2:53:40] [cheering and applause]
[2:53:46] Does that mean [applause]
[2:53:49] if the door is shut that God is in El

[2:55:42] &gt;&gt; The second 2,000 years
[2:55:45] the Jews rejected.
[2:55:48] The Gentiles accepted it.
[2:55:52] [applause]
[2:55:53] &gt;&gt; As God says in Acts 13:46, Paul says,

[2:56:36] Aren't you happy? [cheering]
[2:56:38] You didn't sit outside the door.

[2:56:47] and behind the door
[2:56:50] Jesus was waiting for you. [cheering]
[2:56:55] Come in and sap with me. [cheering]
[2:56:59] Come into the wedding supper.

[2:57:49] &gt;&gt; The third
[2:57:51] 2,000 years
[2:57:58] &gt;&gt; is Matthew 25:10.
[2:58:01] what we read
[2:58:04] &gt;&gt; after the oil,
[2:58:06] &gt;&gt; after they rejected the oil,
[2:58:09] &gt;&gt; after they knew they don't have oil,
[2:58:12] &gt;&gt; the minute they heard the voice
[2:58:15] &gt;&gt; of the seventh seal,
[2:58:17] &gt;&gt; they realized they didn't have oil.
[2:58:21] &gt;&gt; But these guys in the message,
[2:58:23] they don't even know they don't have
[2:58:25] oil.
[2:58:27] How bad are they?
[2:58:30] [applause]
[2:58:32] &gt;&gt; [cheering]
[2:58:34] &gt;&gt; But when they look in El Tabernacle,
[2:58:36] they can see they don't have oil
[2:58:40] [cheering]
[2:58:42] because the oil is here. [cheering]
[2:58:46] I claim it.

[2:59:20] said, "Daniel,
[2:59:23] could you take me to any place outside
[2:59:25] of Eltean?
[2:59:27] that has the oil. I'll pay your fair.
[2:59:31] &gt;&gt; And I'm saying this for over 20 years.
[2:59:35] &gt;&gt; For 20 years, nobody came up to come and
[2:59:37] show me where the oil is. But [cheering]
[2:59:44] but
[2:59:48] right here. [cheering]
[2:59:54] Look at the oil flowing. [cheering]
[2:59:58] And the oil is coming down.
[3:00:01] The oil is coming down. [cheering]

[3:02:12] &gt;&gt; Ministers, you can be cross with me.
[3:02:15] &gt;&gt; You know I'm talking the truth.
[3:02:18] &gt;&gt; You know the door is shut. It's closed.
[3:02:23] There's no movement of the Holy Ghost.
[3:02:26] Working of the Holy Ghost is none.
[3:02:30] Nowhere to be found.
[3:02:33] &gt;&gt; You must beg the people to worship.
[3:02:36] But when the oil come down, you don't
[3:02:38] beg anybody [cheering] to dance, to
[3:02:41] shout,
[3:02:43] speak in tongues.

[3:08:32] Apostle,
[3:08:34] I feel that the Holy Spirit told me that

[3:08:42] I kept quiet. I didn't say anything.
[3:08:46] And she says, "Uh, what do you think,
[3:08:49] uh, Apostle I said, "Judith, you know
[3:08:52] I'm going to tell you the truth."
[3:08:57] &gt;&gt; I said, "It's finished. The door's

[3:10:07] [applause]
[3:10:09] &gt;&gt; God was in the ark.
[3:10:12] &gt;&gt; God was sealed.
[3:10:17] in the bride in Pentecost
[3:10:19] &gt;&gt; and the door closed to the Jews.
[3:10:24] &gt;&gt; And now Matthew 25, the groom closed the
[3:10:27] door.
[3:10:28] &gt;&gt; The doors closed.
[3:10:32] &gt;&gt; When the oil is gone, [cheering]
[3:10:35] &gt;&gt; the door starts moving.
[3:10:38] [applause]
[3:10:42] &gt;&gt; And then what happened when the door is

[3:11:08] What happened?
[3:11:12] &gt;&gt; When the door gets shut,
[3:11:15] then comes Jesus. [cheering]
[3:11:22] [cheering]
[3:11:24] May he come here tonight

[3:16:53] The Jews are rejected.
[3:16:57] They don't get the Holy Ghost to choose.

[3:19:28] &gt;&gt; seals 144,000.
[3:19:32] &gt;&gt; But in Matthew 25, that same sealing

[3:27:23] us.
[3:27:24] Hallelujah. [cheering]
[3:27:25] &gt;&gt; The wise version says, "We can't give

[3:27:33] &gt;&gt; I claimed it.

[3:28:37] [cheering]
[3:28:38] &gt;&gt; they blinded them,
[3:28:41] &gt;&gt; never to see
[3:28:44] the rapture, the oil again.

[3:28:50] &gt;&gt; Now tonight, the door is shut

[3:30:03] &gt;&gt; They hear me preach the oil is gone and
[3:30:06] you don't have it.
[3:30:08] &gt;&gt; And the children in all these churches
[3:30:11] &gt;&gt; is shivering
[3:30:14] &gt;&gt; because they know
[3:30:16] &gt;&gt; they don't have the oil.

[3:32:03] Now, one thing about a door,
[3:32:07] &gt;&gt; a door
[3:32:09] &gt;&gt; is made to open.
[3:32:19] [applause and cheering]
[3:32:26] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[3:32:27] &gt;&gt; A doors made to open,
[3:32:31] &gt;&gt; but it's not meant to always be open.
[3:32:38] &gt;&gt; There's a time it's going to close.
[3:32:40] [cheering]
[3:32:41] [applause]
[3:32:41] &gt;&gt; There was a time when the door Jesus
[3:32:44] Christ was open.
[3:32:46] &gt;&gt; Come all ye that labor and I have labor.
[3:32:50] But there is also a time [cheering]
[3:32:53] when the door of longsuffering
[3:32:57] gets some close.
[3:33:00] [applause]
[3:33:02] And this is not the time for the door to
[3:33:04] open. [cheering] This is the time to
[3:33:07] close the door and lock the bride
[3:33:10] inside.
[3:33:12] [cheering]
[3:33:12] [applause]
[3:33:14] Are you locked in?
[3:33:20] &gt;&gt; [cheering]
[3:33:22] [applause]
[3:33:26] [cheering]
[3:33:30] [applause and cheering]
[3:33:35] &gt;&gt; And a door, [cheering] a door has two
[3:33:38] hinges
[3:33:40] &gt;&gt; that opens and close it.
[3:33:44] &gt;&gt; If it's got what? If if it's got one
[3:33:46] hinge,
[3:33:48] &gt;&gt; then it can't
[3:33:50] &gt;&gt; open or close.
[3:33:54] &gt;&gt; If you only got the word,
[3:33:56] &gt;&gt; it can't open and close. But the Lord
[3:34:00] Jesus Christ got two hinges.
[3:34:05] Spirit
[3:34:06] and truth [cheering]
[3:34:11] [applause]
[3:34:14] dynamics
[3:34:17] and
[3:34:19] [cheering]
[3:34:20] &gt;&gt; former rain and rain.
[3:34:23] &gt;&gt; Former rain.
[3:34:25] &gt;&gt; Then let the door close then. Heat.
[3:34:28] [cheering]
[3:34:30] [applause]
[3:34:34] [cheering]
[3:34:35] Heat.

[3:34:48] &gt;&gt; [cheering]
[3:34:50] [applause]
[3:34:50] &gt;&gt; Now,
[3:34:52] &gt;&gt; the door can close,
[3:34:55] but somebody can still open it, right?
[3:34:58] &gt;&gt; But a door has a lock on.
[3:35:02] &gt;&gt; And a lock needs a key.
[3:35:05] [cheering] And a key is faith.
[3:35:08] &gt;&gt; And faith come by the seven thunders
[3:35:11] give you faith. [cheering]
[3:35:14] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[3:35:16] &gt;&gt; Have you got the seven thunders?
[3:35:19] [cheering]
[3:35:22] &gt;&gt; Then you got the key. [cheering]
[3:35:26] &gt;&gt; Keep the key.
[3:35:31] [cheering]
[3:35:33] [applause]
[3:35:40] &gt;&gt; [cheering and applause]
[3:35:43] &gt;&gt; You can open the door. [cheering]
[3:35:52] [cheering]
[3:35:55] &gt;&gt; And you can
[3:35:58] [cheering]

[3:36:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[3:36:14] [applause and cheering]
[3:36:21] Hallelujah. [cheering]
[3:36:24] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[3:36:28] [applause]

[3:37:07] [applause]
[3:37:12] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[3:37:13] [cheering]
[3:37:21] [applause and cheering]
[3:37:26] &gt;&gt; And then the bridegroom says to her,
[3:37:30] &gt;&gt; "Come in.
[3:37:34] &gt;&gt; Come in."
[3:37:37] Amen.
[3:37:38] &gt;&gt; While the door was closed to the foolish
[3:37:41] version,
[3:37:43] &gt;&gt; Revelations 4:1 says there's a door open
[3:37:45] in heaven for the bride.
[3:37:49] [applause]
[3:37:49] &gt;&gt; And a voice says, "Come up higher."
[3:37:55] Brian, [cheering]
[3:37:56] [applause]
[3:37:57] &gt;&gt; El Tabernacle,
[3:38:00] &gt;&gt; come up higher. [cheering]
[3:38:05] Come up higher. [cheering and applause]
[3:38:16] [applause]
[3:38:21] &gt;&gt; And yellow is a mystery.
[3:38:25] &gt;&gt; And he says, "Come in."
[3:38:27] Now, how could you go in to the wedding
[3:38:30] supper with this flesh body?
[3:38:37] &gt;&gt; That means
[3:38:39] they had a body change.
[3:38:43] [cheering and applause]
[3:38:44] &gt;&gt; Before they could go in,
[3:38:48] &gt;&gt; their body changed.
[3:38:51] [cheering]
[3:38:54] [applause]
[3:38:58] You had a body change [cheering]
[3:39:02] &gt;&gt; for you killed that old man
[3:39:07] &gt;&gt; and now you have a body change.
[3:39:10] &gt;&gt; Your body changed. [cheering]
[3:39:13] The things you used to do,
[3:39:16] you do them no more. [cheering]
[3:39:19] You had a body change.
[3:39:22] You had a body change.
[3:39:27] You don't like nice times anymore
[3:39:30] &gt;&gt; because the night times now lay behind
[3:39:32] the door.
[3:39:36] [cheering]
[3:39:39] [applause]
[3:39:40] &gt;&gt; Come on now. Come on now. Come on out.
[3:39:43] [cheering]
[3:39:50] [applause]
[3:39:51] Right here in verse 10.
[3:39:54] The voice and the trumpet took place
[3:39:59] &gt;&gt; and they changed
[3:40:02] &gt;&gt; and then they went in cuz they can't go
[3:40:05] in with their bodies.
[3:40:07] &gt;&gt; Flesh and blood cannot inherit the
[3:40:09] kingdom of God.
[3:40:12] &gt;&gt; So I show you a mystery here
[3:40:16] [applause and cheering]
[3:40:18] that the wise virgin went in.
[3:40:22] But you know,
[3:40:27] &gt;&gt; there was one of the foolish virgins
[3:40:30] that slipped in with him.
[3:40:34] &gt;&gt; She look alike
[3:40:36] &gt;&gt; in every way
[3:40:39] and she slipped in.
[3:40:43] How? Nobody knows. But she was in the
[3:40:45] wedding.
[3:40:49] Every now and then they slip in. Yeah.
[3:40:55] [applause]
[3:41:03] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[3:41:12] [applause]
[3:41:14] &gt;&gt; And the bridegroom said to her,
[3:41:17] "Friend,
[3:41:19] &gt;&gt; what are you doing here in E Tabernacle?
[3:41:24] &gt;&gt; You didn't come from Raymond Thompson.
[3:41:28] &gt;&gt; What do you want here?
[3:41:31] We see you don't have the your Gloria
[3:41:34] garment on.
[3:41:38] [applause]
[3:41:40] [cheering]
[3:41:42] &gt;&gt; Get out [applause]
[3:41:48] [cheering]

[3:41:58] and the door was shut.
[3:42:02] &gt;&gt; I'm going to leave the rest of the

[3:42:05] [cheering]

[3:42:12] [cheering and applause]
[3:42:13] is shut.

[3:42:36] [applause]
[3:42:38] &gt;&gt; Is there anybody here
[3:42:41] that needs the wedding garment?
[3:42:47] &gt;&gt; Is there anybody here that needs more?
[3:42:50] [cheering]
[3:43:00] Now, let's call on the Lord.
[3:43:03] &gt;&gt; Call on him.
[3:43:05] Cuz when the door is shut, [cheering]
[3:43:08] he's standing right next to you now.
[3:43:12] [applause]
[3:43:14] [cheering]

[4:05:38] [applause]
[4:05:43] [applause]
[4:05:46] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[4:05:51] Yeah.
[4:05:56] &gt;&gt; [music]
[4:06:02] &gt;&gt; Thanks.
[4:06:09] Thank you so much.
[4:06:19] [applause]
[4:06:26] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[4:06:27] [music]
[4:06:34] [applause]
[4:06:34] [music]
[4:06:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[4:06:41] [music]
[4:06:45] Lord,
[4:06:47] [music]
[4:06:48] [applause]
[4:06:56] [music]
[4:07:01] [music]
[4:07:05] thank you. [applause]
[4:07:12] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[4:07:14] &gt;&gt; as I finish
[4:07:19] off this meeting.
[4:07:21] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[4:07:26] &gt;&gt; Remember,
[4:07:32] &gt;&gt; more than 20 years ago,
[4:07:37] &gt;&gt; I told you the Holy Ghost is gone.
[4:07:43] And now I come back
[4:07:47] to show you the sequence.
[4:07:50] If the Holy Ghost leaves,
[4:07:54] the door gets shut.
[4:08:03] [applause]
[4:08:05] [music]
[4:08:06] &gt;&gt; And now the door is shut.
[4:08:08] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[4:08:12] &gt;&gt; If that door shuts
[4:08:18] and you still a sinner,
[4:08:22] you're never going to be saved.
[4:08:25] Your day is gone.
[4:08:29] Cuz he shuts the door
[4:08:33] and you can't find the door no more.
[4:08:45] You can't even save your children's
[4:08:48] soul.
[4:08:59] The foolish virgin said a half an hour
[4:09:05] to fill up
[4:09:08] and it didn't fill up.
[4:09:13] And then the Holy Ghost leaves them
[4:09:18] and heaven's door shuts.
[4:09:26] All these years it was just open as much
[4:09:28] as that
[4:09:31] &gt;&gt; and you could only go in like a crab
[4:09:34] like this.
[4:09:38] Now it's closed.
[4:09:48] It's gone.
[4:10:02] But brother Oscar, what about them
[4:10:03] that's still coming?
[4:10:08] God's got his
[4:10:11] talked away that never heard the gospel.
[4:10:16] But you that hear the gospel.
[4:10:20] Goodbye.
[4:10:23] [applause]
[4:10:28] I hope I'm wrong,
[4:10:30] but up till now I am not.
[4:10:38] And the door
[4:10:41] is shut. It's closed.
[4:10:46] We going to be able to pick up one here
[4:10:50] and one there and one there.
[4:11:00] As I said, the door Jesus
[4:11:03] is not going to be always open.
[4:11:13] He closes
[4:11:16] the door.
[4:11:20] That's why I came
[4:11:26] with that little story.
[4:11:36] A murderous confession.
[4:11:41] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[4:11:42] &gt;&gt; We can only kill ourselves
[4:11:46] and beg
[4:11:48] for mercy.
[4:11:51] You oldtimes that's been so long with
[4:11:53] us.
[4:11:54] Watch that the devil don't trick you
[4:11:58] against the ministry.
[4:12:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:12:04] [applause]
[4:12:10] Don't get too big for your boots
[4:12:12] [applause]
[4:12:20] because the door is closed.
[4:12:23] You'll never come in back again.
[4:12:28] Two years ago, we spoke on the 70th
[4:12:31] Jubilee and the church was packed with
[4:12:35] vacciners.
[4:12:39] You remember
[4:12:41] how many of them could make it?
[4:12:49] None.
[4:12:51] None.
[4:12:55] And how bad is it going to be now
[4:13:00] when the door is shut?
[4:13:05] And this is where
[4:13:07] the foolish virgin made her biggest
[4:13:09] mistake.
[4:13:13] We put it on.
[4:13:15] You're doing what you are told,
[4:13:19] foolish virgin,
[4:13:21] but not doing what's right.
[4:13:26] Your pastors told you a lot of things
[4:13:30] that's not scriptural.
[4:13:34] And you were doing what was
[4:13:38] what they told you,
[4:13:42] but you didn't do what God said.
[4:13:47] You do what your girlfriend told you,
[4:13:52] but you didn't do what is right. Amen.
[4:14:01] &gt;&gt; Young girl, you're running after flesh
[4:14:07] and you don't even know it's time to
[4:14:08] drop the flesh,
[4:14:13] to kill the flesh.
[4:14:21] It's time that you search yourself
[4:14:26] before we go into this new year.
[4:14:33] A thing that I hate that I see in our
[4:14:35] tabernacle
[4:14:37] is these young children
[4:14:40] that wants to tell their parents what to
[4:14:42] do.
[4:14:44] Found a sister from Cape Town.
[4:14:47] says the child want to go home.
[4:14:50] Send the deacons over there. The child
[4:14:52] was under drugs
[4:14:56] pressing her.
[4:14:58] She must go home. Since when do we hear
[4:15:00] listen to children?
[4:15:03] When Gersian didn't listen, I kicked him
[4:15:05] out.
[4:15:08] Al tabernacle don't listen to children.
[4:15:14] Children listens to us.
[4:15:17] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[4:15:25] [applause]
[4:15:27] &gt;&gt; They do what they told from their
[4:15:30] friends,
[4:15:32] but they don't do what is right.
[4:15:35] It's time we do what is right.
[4:15:39] [applause]
[4:15:46] Search me. [applause]
[4:15:49] Oh Lord,
[4:15:56] I told a sister the other day,
[4:15:59] take your heart off your child
[4:16:03] cuz you're going to lose your soul, too.
[4:16:23] stubborn.
[4:16:28] And now it's nearly impossible for you
[4:16:30] to come back.
[4:16:40] You struggled with your boy all the
[4:16:42] years
[4:16:44] cuz you patched him up.
[4:16:47] How does he look tonight?
[4:16:52] How is he looking tonight?
[4:17:02] It's no time to patch up.
[4:17:05] Son or no son,
[4:17:08] kick him out.
[4:17:13] [applause]
[4:17:19] [music]
[4:17:24] If Job, Noah, Daniel
[4:17:27] had to live in this [music] day tonight,
[4:17:32] they could only save their own souls.
[4:17:35] Can't save your children's souls.
[4:17:40] They want to go to hell.
[4:17:42] I told Gersian, "When you open your
[4:17:44] eyes, you saw me here.
[4:17:47] And when you close [music] this eyes,
[4:17:49] you're going to find me here.
[4:17:55] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[4:17:57] [music]
[4:18:03] &gt;&gt; You're too nice with your children
[4:18:08] because you think if you're so nice
[4:18:10] [music] that's love. That's not love.
[4:18:14] That's compromise.
[4:18:16] Because it's your child.
[4:18:19] I don't know how many people,
[4:18:22] deacons even
[4:18:25] that was with me,
[4:18:28] that straightened out all the other
[4:18:30] people's children. When it came to
[4:18:32] theirs, they couldn't straighten them
[4:18:35] out.
[4:18:37] They left with their children and they
[4:18:38] backsliden with their children.
[4:18:42] Only
[4:18:45] thing that helps
[4:18:51] is God's word.
[4:18:55] [applause]
[4:19:02] [music]
[4:19:04] [applause]
[4:19:08] Search me.
[4:19:14] Stop
[4:19:16] looking at your child. Look at Jesus.
[4:19:19] If you don't act like Jesus is not
[4:19:22] worthy to be your boy.
[4:19:33] [applause]
[4:19:34] Wouldn't
[4:19:45] you like to kill yourself tonight?
[4:19:51] [music]
[4:19:58] &gt;&gt; [music]
[4:20:06] [music]
[4:20:09] &gt;&gt; Is there any wicked ways still to live
[4:20:11] in you?
[4:20:12] [singing]
[4:20:16] &gt;&gt; Let's kill that wicked way tonight.
[4:20:19] [music]
[4:20:26] &gt;&gt; [music]
[4:20:26] &gt;&gt; Let's commit suicide.
[4:20:36] [music]
[4:20:43] &gt;&gt; [applause and music]
[4:20:48] [music]
[4:20:51] &gt;&gt; God bless you.
[4:20:54] [music]
[4:20:57] &gt;&gt; And the doors [music]
[4:21:00] are shut.
[4:21:05] And the wise virgin says, "I [music]
[4:21:07] cannot give you any oil.
[4:21:14] I just got enough for myself."
[4:21:19] Brother Oscar, why don't you [music] go
[4:21:21] to the other churches and help them? I
[4:21:24] already done it. Here's the flags
[4:21:25] hanging.
[4:21:28] They didn't want it.
[4:21:30] [music and applause]
[4:21:31] Look at all those flags.
[4:21:34] But on every flag there's a tape.
[4:21:41] And now I cannot do it no more
[4:21:49] because the [music] door is shut.
[4:21:53] Brother Jonathan
[4:22:00] &gt;&gt; [music]
[4:22:09] &gt;&gt; Let [music]
[4:22:11] [singing]
[4:22:12] me see.
[4:22:15] Amen. [music]

[4:22:36] &gt;&gt; Search [singing]
[4:22:39] me,

[4:26:57] &gt;&gt; [music]
[4:28:05] &gt;&gt; Is there anybody?
[4:28:11] It says this was for me, not for
[4:28:14] somebody next to you.
[4:28:17] Your apostle spoke to me.
[4:28:20] Is there anybody like that?
[4:28:38] Not someone else is the target. I'm the
[4:28:41] target.
[4:28:44] It was directly to my
[4:28:58] kill myself.
[4:29:06] There's people at the altar.
[4:29:10] &gt;&gt; There's people killing themselves. That

[4:30:16] for we're going to take communion
[4:30:20] tonight.
[4:30:22] the crossing over tonight.
[4:30:26] Is there anyone that examined themselves
[4:30:28] or was it just somebody else?
[4:30:34] You felt, "No, that's not for me.
[4:30:36] Somebody else."
[4:30:39] But before we take the communion, are
[4:30:42] you examining what the man said?
[4:30:47] I beg you to ask him
[4:30:50] &gt;&gt; who was talking to us tonight.
[4:31:04] &gt;&gt; Is there a young girl that is rude to
[4:31:06] her parents? Are you examining yourself?
[4:31:18] Oh, tonight I realize God's spirit not
[4:31:20] going to strive with any man anymore.
[4:31:22] [singing]
[4:31:25] God is not going to strive anymore. You
[4:31:27] heard he strived all the time.
[4:31:31] Is there anyone here? Why are you okay?
[4:31:35] You feel okay? It's fine.
[4:31:39] You'll feel

[4:32:16] want to be like that.
[4:32:19] I want to tell you, but I'm not doing
[4:32:23] help the preacher tonight. Lord,
[4:32:28] tabernacle,
[4:32:30] it's later than what you think it is.
[4:32:33] [music]
[4:32:42] I believe the spirit spoke plainly
[4:32:44] tonight.
[4:32:46] It was not it was plainly speaking to
[4:32:49] us.
[4:32:51] He that has an ear,
[4:32:54] let him hear what God told you to know.
[4:33:31] Thank you.
[4:33:38] Spirit to the earth.
[4:33:43] Lord,

[4:48:06] &gt;&gt; [music]
[4:48:24] [applause]
[4:50:01] &gt;&gt; Dad,
[4:50:03] stop.
[4:52:40] I wonder
[4:52:44] precious brother Ignatius
[4:52:49] come to read us the scripture for the
[4:52:51] communion.
[4:53:15] Amen.
[4:53:17] As we turn to our
[4:53:20] scripture,
[4:53:25] scripture,
[4:53:27] turn to 1 Corinthians
[4:53:30] chapter 11,
[4:53:32] reading from verse 23
[4:53:35] to 34.
[4:53:40] If you have it, it reads as follows.
[4:53:44] For I have received of the Lord
[4:53:48] that which also I delivered unto you,
[4:53:52] that the Lord Jesus the same night in
[4:53:55] which he was betrayed, [music]
[4:53:57] he took bread,
[4:54:00] and when he had given thanks, he broke
[4:54:03] it and said, "Take it. This is my body
[4:54:08] which is broken for you.
[4:54:12] This give [screaming] me remembrance of
[4:54:14] me.
[4:54:16] After the same manner also he took the
[4:54:20] cup.
[4:54:22] [crying] When he has supper, saying,
[4:54:25] "This cup is the new testament in my
[4:54:28] blood. This do you as often as you drink
[4:54:31] it in remembrance of me.
[4:54:35] For as often as you eat this bread and
[4:54:40] drink this cup, it will show the Lord's
[4:54:43] death till he come. Wherefore, whoever
[4:54:48] shall eat this bread and drink it this
[4:54:51] cup of the Lord [music] unworthily shall
[4:54:54] be guilty of the body in the blood of
[4:54:57] the Lord.
[4:54:59] But let a man examine himself,
[4:55:03] and so [music] let him
[4:55:05] of that bread and drink of that cup. For
[4:55:09] he that eateth and drinkketh unworthily
[4:55:13] eateth and drinkketh damnation to
[4:55:15] himself, not discerning the Lord's body.
[4:55:19] For this cause many are weak and sickly
[4:55:23] among you, and many sleep. For if we
[4:55:27] would judge ourselves, we should not be
[4:55:30] judged. But when we are just, we are
[4:55:33] chasing of the Lord that we should not
[4:55:36] be condemned with the world. Wherefore
[4:55:39] my brethren, when you come together to
[4:55:42] eat [music] tar for one another, and if
[4:55:46] any man hunger, let him eat at home,
[4:55:51] that you come not together unto
[4:55:52] condemnation,
[4:55:54] and the rest [music] will I set in order
[4:55:58] when I come.
[4:56:02] We just take
[4:56:04] moment of silence as we examine
[4:56:06] ourselves.
[4:56:20] Amen.
[4:56:22] I want to ask brotherly
[4:56:25] to come and pray
[4:56:27] for the Lord's table. Amen.
[4:56:46] Amen.
[4:56:51] Thank you Lord Jesus.
[4:56:54] Thank you blessed savior.
[4:56:57] Father, it's with a humble heart.
[4:57:00] Father, it's with a contrite spirit,

[4:57:10] Thank you, Lord, that we are behind the
[4:57:12] shut door, Lord Jesus.

[4:57:40] and tonight we find ourselves behind the

[4:57:58] and break bread with thee behind closed
[4:58:01] doors tonight Lord.
[4:58:04] Father Lord Jesus we had a foolish
[4:58:06] virgin will not have this opportunity
[4:58:10] Lord to come and break bread with thee
[4:58:13] Lord. Father tonight Lord Jesus we want

[6:27:15] Oh God, Lord, we're so thankful,
[6:27:18] heavenly father, Lord, that you brought
[6:27:20] us thus far.
[6:27:22] And we're so thankful, Lord, that you
[6:27:23] sent an angel our way, heavenly father.
[6:27:26] Lord, when we look back to 2025, we
[6:27:29] started the year with a mighty angel.
[6:27:31] And we're so thankful, Lord God, that
[6:27:33] that mighty angels could keep their
[6:27:35] doors open for El Tabernacle for us to
[6:27:38] cross over in
[6:27:41] to the higher calling this evening.
[6:27:43] Heavenly Father, Lord, thank you, Lord,
[6:27:45] for an upward pool, oh God, that could
[6:27:47] pull us in through the door. Heavenly
[6:27:49] Father, Lord, we're so thankful that we
[6:27:51] could be part of you and your beautiful
[6:27:53] kingdom this evening. Heavenly Father,
[6:27:56] Lord, thank you so much for the man that
[6:27:58] is the pinnacle of prophecies to the
[6:28:00] Gentile dispensation. Oh God, Lord, when
[6:28:03] we look back to 2025,
[6:28:05] we can see, Lord, that surely you've
[6:28:07] been Jehovah Gyra, the Lord our
[6:28:09] provider. Lord, you've been Jehovah
[6:28:11] Shama, the everpresent help in the time
[6:28:14] of trouble and trials. Oh God, we're so
[6:28:17] thankful, Lord, that we've seen you in
[6:28:19] different attributes and different ways
[6:28:21] throughout this year. Oh God, and we're
[6:28:23] so thankful, oh God, that in El
[6:28:25] Tabernacle, we know you as Jehovah
[6:28:27] Rosco, the manifestation of God in
[6:28:29] flesh. Lord, thank you, Lord, for coming
[6:28:32] down our way to open the way to open the
[6:28:35] door. Heavenly Father, and to call us
[6:28:37] into the beloved of the Lord. Thank you
[6:28:40] for opening the door for us, heavenly
[6:28:42] father. Lord, that we can be in the joy
[6:28:45] of the Lord. Heavenly Father, Lord,
[6:28:47] we're so thankful for everything you've
[6:28:49] done for us, Lord. And Lord, as we
[6:28:52] depart, Lord, may your spirit go and
[6:28:54] prepare the way for those that will be
[6:28:56] traveling, Lord, to our respective
[6:28:58] homes. Heavenly Father, Lord, may that
[6:29:00] same angel that started last year, that
[6:29:03] started this year, Lord God, may he go
[6:29:04] with us as he shut us into the Shakina
[6:29:07] glory, as he shut us into the Aoya of
[6:29:09] God, may that Aoya that we were shut
[6:29:12] into move heavenly father, Lord, and
[6:29:14] protect us as we leave to our respective
[6:29:17] homes, oh God. May you just bless us
[6:29:19] with safe traveling mercies. Lord, we
[6:29:21] pray Lord for our precious apostle that
[6:29:23] you'd strengthen him. Heavenly Father,
[6:29:25] like never before, Lord. We've never
[6:29:27] seen a man such as this. Heavenly
[6:29:29] Father, thank you for sending us an odd
[6:29:31] pole. Thank you for sending us a man
[6:29:34] that we can see right through the
[6:29:36] footprints of the Bible. Lord, we pray
[6:29:39] Lord that you'd restore all the virtue
[6:29:40] that has left his body. Remember our
[6:29:42] precious senior pastor Jonathan, Pastor
[6:29:44] Jude, our precious pastor Edgar Rosco
[6:29:47] Jr., Brother GL, the entire Rosco
[6:29:49] family, Lord. God, bless and undertake
[6:29:52] for them even the more, Lord. May the
[6:29:54] same fullness that dwells upon the
[6:29:55] father dwell upon each and every one of
[6:29:57] them, Lord. And just like Aaron, Lord,
[6:30:00] may it reach from the head down to the
[6:30:03] beard, heavenly father, Lord, and even
[6:30:04] down to the skirts. And may we just be
[6:30:07] filled with more of that rain that
[6:30:09] Apostle says should fall upon us,
[6:30:11] heavenly father. May it rain so much
[6:30:13] upon us until we lose trace of our flesh
[6:30:16] in the sea of forgetfulness. Lord, may
[6:30:18] you take our flesh so deep in the sea of
[6:30:20] forgetfulness until we cannot even go
[6:30:23] and take it back. Heavenly Father, thank
[6:30:25] you so much for this beautiful service.
[6:30:26] May you bless each and everyone that is
[6:30:28] here. And may we depart Lord in your
[6:30:30] shakina glory. We ask it not by might,
[6:30:33] not by power, but by the baptism of the
[6:30:35] Holy Ghost of the apostle in your
[6:30:37] infallible name of [music] Jesus King
[6:30:38] God. Amen and amen.
