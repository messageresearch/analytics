[0:09] how many Christian exchange brandom for
[0:12] a medium for an antichrist for a false
[0:16] prophet for a deceiver how can it be
[0:21] what a mental
[0:23] perversion what a spiritual
[0:25] Madness what a religious
[0:28] foolishness now if John the Baptist was
[0:33] more than a prophet and John did not
[0:36] operate any healing Miracles or any
[0:40] Wonder but he simply announced the
[0:43] arrival of the
[0:44] Messiah what about then the ministry of
[0:49] William ranam who in addition to the
[0:51] great wonders and the wonderful and
[0:55] Powerful Miracles that he performed and
[0:58] the signs and the visions and the
[1:02] prophecies and The Apparition of angels
[1:05] and the pillar of of of cloud and the
[1:09] voice from Heaven and the opening of The
[1:11] Seven Seals and beside all this his
[1:16] ministry that forun the Rapture of the
[1:19] bride and the second coming of the
[1:23] Lord H what about the ministry of
[1:27] branam branam who who discerned the
[1:31] thoughts of men's heart in all
[1:35] details branam who commanded the demon
[1:38] to leave the sick and the disease
[1:41] disappeared Bram who called the dead to
[1:45] life and during his ministry seven dead
[1:48] people
[1:50] resurrected branam who received visions
[1:53] that came to pass to the letter Bram who
[1:58] interpreted the dreams of the people
[2:00] without them telling him the dream but
[2:04] first he told them what they had dreamed
[2:07] and then he gave them the
[2:09] interpretation like Daniel did Bram whom
[2:14] the angel of the Lord spoke face to face
[2:17] Bram whom the Lamb of God opened the
[2:21] Seven Seals and revealed to him the
[2:24] contents Bram through which Ministry God
[2:28] did many all those wonderful
[2:32] things is
[2:34] therefore branam more than a prophet yes
[2:41] he is more than a prophet I firmly
[2:45] believe that anyone who says a single
[2:48] word against this Prophet or against the
[2:51] message that he preached it will never
[2:54] be
[2:55] forgiven never
[2:57] forgiven why not be forgiven given
[3:01] because he who speaks against this work
[3:03] of the Holy Ghost in This man does not
[3:08] speak against the man but against God
[3:12] against the Holy
[3:15] Spirit and this is a
[3:18] blasphemy yes one of these days the
[3:21] Bride of Jesus Christ will be taken away
[3:25] and you will be left here in the Great
[3:27] Tribulation where there will be weeping
[3:30] nashing of
[3:32] teeth if you reject the ministry of
[3:34] William ranam you have rejected Jesus
[3:38] Christ himself why because it was the
[3:43] spirit of the Lord Jesus Christ that was
[3:45] working through William Marian branam
[3:50] did not Jesus said that whosoever
[3:53] receives the one that he sends receives
[3:57] Jesus and did not Jesus said that
[4:00] whosoever rejects the one that he sends
[4:03] rejects Jesus if you reject this
[4:07] ministry of branam one of these days you
[4:11] will say the same thing that the Jews
[4:13] said in front of Jesus crucified truly
[4:18] this man was the son of God they
[4:21] recognized him too late they recognized
[4:25] him after they had rejected him and
[4:28] crucified him him remember it is not
[4:33] what you say of ranam that determinates
[4:36] who is William branam no but it is what
[4:42] you say of branam that determines what
[4:45] you are and what will be of you I
[4:49] concluded by repeating the question what
[4:53] do you say of William Mariam
[4:57] BR if you do not know anything about the
[5:00] ministry of William branam I suggest you
[5:03] to visit the sites that you will find
[5:07] Hereafter
[5:09] investigate examine search the scripture
[5:12] do not stand on here say will you listen
[5:16] to my heartfelt
[5:19] advice will you be humble enough in your
[5:22] spirit to examine the preaching of
[5:24] William ranham comparing it not with the
[5:28] belief of your denomination
[5:30] but with the Bible or you want to be
[5:33] part of that large number of believers
[5:36] who say Lord Lord but do not do the will
[5:40] of God and Jesus on that day not now
[5:45] will cast you away from his presence
[5:48] telling you that he has never known you
[5:53] as it is written in Matthew 7 verse
[5:57] 23 I leave it to you the
[6:04] [Music]
[6:08] choice
