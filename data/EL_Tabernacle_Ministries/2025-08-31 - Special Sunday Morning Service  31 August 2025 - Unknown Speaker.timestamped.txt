[11:09] I wonder this time where we are in as we
[11:12] stand. We're going to welcome brother Y
[11:17] to open the word this prayer meeting in
[11:19] a word of prayer. As we bow our heads
[11:23] and we close our eyes,
[11:29] we all bow and close eyes of Jesus, King
[11:32] God. Heavenly Father, it's truly an
[11:34] honor and a privilege, oh God, to
[11:36] approach your throne of grace, your
[11:38] throne of mercy this morning. Oh God,
[11:42] what can we say after a service like
[11:44] yesterday's? Oh God, we are truly
[11:46] blessed, Lord, to have a leadership, oh
[11:49] God, a man of God sent by you, oh Lord.
[11:52] We thank you for him. We pray that you
[11:54] may strengthen him, oh God. You
[11:56] undertake for him. May you guide him in
[11:58] every step of the way. May you just
[12:00] strengthen each and every bone, every
[12:02] fiber in his being. You go before the
[12:04] Rosco family. May you be with him. Keep
[12:07] them in the palm of your hand and my
[12:08] savior. Please, Lord Jesus. May you be
[12:11] with the tabernacle this morning. You
[12:12] fill us with the Holy Ghost. Lord God,
[12:15] we lift up our vessels toward you, oh
[12:17] God. We submit ourselves to you, oh God.
[12:20] Lord Jesus, King God, in everything that
[12:22] we do today, may it all come together in
[12:24] order to give you all the glory, the
[12:26] honor, and the praises. Lord, we ask
[12:28] this in God's name. Amen and amen.
[12:36] Church, don't you just appreciate God's
[12:38] apostle for the powerful message he gave
[12:40] us yesterday?
[12:42] Then you turn around in your homes and
[12:44] just give God, your neighbor, a
[12:47] wonderful hug. Say, "I love you. I
[12:49] appreciate you."
[12:52] Just tell your loved one next to you, "I
[12:54] appreciate you with my whole heart." as
[12:57] we sing. Holy, holy, holy are you Lord.
[13:04] [Music]
[13:06] Sing it with me. Sing holy, holy, holy
[13:11] are you, Lord.
[13:17] Holy, holy, holy are you, Lord.
[13:24] [Applause]

[13:30] the redeemed worship.
[13:35] Holy, holy, holy are you Lord.
[13:42] Sing with me. Say holy, holy, holy are
[13:48] you Lord.
[13:51] With your hands raised, holy, holy, holy
[13:57] are you.
[14:01] Holy
[14:04] angels.
[14:07] The redeemed
[14:09] worship you.
[14:12] Holy, holy, holy are you Lord. because
[14:18] you're welcome to minister. Oh,

[14:25] you Lord.
[14:28] Singing

[14:36] Oh,
[14:39] the earth angels b
[14:43] the red worship you.
[14:48] Holy, holy, holy are you Lord.
[14:54] Can we give God a handy praise?
[14:58] [Music]
[15:05] Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[15:08] So good to be in his house this morning
[15:13] on the Sunday
[15:16] sunrise morning.
[15:19] Many people didn't wake up this morning
[15:24] but we thank God that we could see
[15:26] another sunrise,
[15:28] another morning where the sun has risen
[15:31] in our lives. the son called Beth,
[15:36] the son of the living God.
[15:38] We want to say thank you to Jesus, King
[15:42] God, this morning for waking us up and
[15:46] how blessed we are after this combine
[15:49] to hear God's servant to hear the
[15:52] apostle preach a masterpiece.
[15:56] And I could only think last night about
[15:59] of how he threw out theology,
[16:04] threw out tradition out of the water.
[16:08] And it just shows you that if you a son
[16:10] and a daughter of God, if you come from
[16:13] God and you're going back to God again,
[16:15] there's no tradition,
[16:18] there's no situation on earth that you
[16:21] can say this is the way I am. But we've
[16:25] learned the character of Jesus Christ.
[16:28] We've learned the nature of Jesus Christ
[16:30] through a ministry, through a vessel,
[16:33] through an apostle. And I just want to
[16:35] thank God this morning for true
[16:37] leadership because it shows you that
[16:40] there's only one garment. It shows you
[16:43] there's only one way to enter in, and
[16:46] that's through this ministry.
[16:50] Hallelujah.
[16:52] And this morning I just want to start
[16:53] off with a quotation, two quotations and
[16:56] two scriptures before we go into the
[16:58] prayer. It made me think of prophet
[17:01] visit South Africa.
[17:03] Um brother Brandham says during another
[17:06] meeting in Johannesburg, a young boy
[17:08] about seven or eight years old was
[17:10] called up in a prayer line.
[17:13] A prayer line. A prayer line. But the
[17:17] Brandham spoke to the boy for a few
[17:19] minutes explaining that the weak heart
[17:22] which he had was caused by demon
[17:24] oppression. And the apostle said a while
[17:27] back he said that to know the depths of
[17:31] God, you need to know the depths of
[17:34] Satan. And I thank God for an apostle
[17:38] that knows the depths of Satan, that
[17:41] took us out from all our demonology,
[17:44] that showed us the way. Hallelujah.
[17:48] He told him that he would be delivered
[17:51] someday
[17:53] would be preaching and he would be
[17:55] preaching the exact same gospel that was
[17:59] being brought to the people of South
[18:02] Africa.
[18:04] Suddenly, brother Brandham turned to the
[18:05] audience and during a few minutes or
[18:08] moments of silence, it was evident that
[18:11] he was seeing a vision of something over
[18:14] the audience.
[18:16] In other words, the weak heart of the
[18:20] apostle.
[18:22] It's something that he knows the stories
[18:24] we've heard growing up. He knows the
[18:27] underworld. He knows the other side. And
[18:30] I just want to thank God this morning
[18:33] that we have an apostle. We have a
[18:37] leader. We have someone that can take us
[18:40] out from where we came from, from all
[18:43] the things we believed. It just shows
[18:46] you that we have the right ministry. And
[18:48] this morning, I have a grateful heart, a
[18:50] thankful heart. And just one more
[18:53] quotation before I read the scripture.
[19:00] The world is again falling apart.
[19:04] They have a refreshed
[19:07] anointing, anointed word of promise for
[19:11] this age. And he is always the word. If
[19:15] God sent us an anointed promise word
[19:19] again for this age, in other words, you
[19:22] cannot have an anointed age, you cannot
[19:25] have an anointed man, you cannot have an
[19:28] anointed word without the oil. You need
[19:31] the oil to anoint the word. In 1946, he
[19:36] would be the same
[19:39] as he was when he come in the beginning,
[19:42] the anointed word for the age. And El
[19:45] tabernacle, we've got the anointed age.
[19:48] We've got the anointed word and we've
[19:51] got the anointed man. We've got the oil
[19:54] this morning. So, right there in your
[19:56] home,
[19:58] may you reach out this morning. And I
[20:01] believe there's no ministry like this.
[20:03] It's evident that we have the token.
[20:06] Hallelujah.
[20:08] The word of the Lord says in Luke the
[20:11] 18th chapter
[20:14] and he said and spake a parable
[20:18] unto them to this end that men ought to
[20:22] always pray and not faint. You always
[20:26] got to pray. You don't have to faint
[20:29] this morning. saying, "There was in a
[20:33] city a judge which fearth not God,
[20:35] neither regarded man, and there was a
[20:38] widow in the city, and she came and said
[20:41] unto him, saying, Avenge me of mine
[20:43] adversary, and ye would not for a while,
[20:47] but afterwards he said unto him, Though
[20:50] I fear not God, nor regard men, yet
[20:54] because this widow troubleth me, I will
[20:57] avenge her, lest by her continually
[21:00] coming, she worry me. And we were taught
[21:03] that whatever you ask God in prayer, you
[21:06] ask and you ask and you ask until God
[21:10] answers that prayer. And this morning,
[21:12] we want to wear him this morning. We
[21:15] want to ask God this morning. We want to
[21:18] plead our case this morning. Hallelujah.
[21:23] One more scripture before we go into the
[21:25] prayer.
[21:27] Judges 16 verse 26.
[21:33] And Samson
[21:36] said unto the lad that held him by the
[21:39] hand,
[21:41] suffer me that I may feel the pillars
[21:45] whereupon the house standeth,
[21:48] that I may lean upon them.
[21:51] Now the house was full of men and women,
[21:54] and all the lords of the Philistines
[21:55] were there.
[21:58] And there were upon the roof about 3,000
[22:01] men and women that beheld while Samuel
[22:04] Samson made sport. And Samson called
[22:08] unto the Lord. He prayed
[22:11] and said, "Oh Lord God, remember me. I
[22:15] pray thee the strength
[22:19] and strengthen me. I pray thee only this
[22:23] once, oh God. He asked for a once more,
[22:27] Lord. And this morning, we want to ask
[22:30] for a once more, Lord. Because I believe
[22:33] that in this house, there is someone in
[22:37] this house that standing between the
[22:39] pillars, the vessel of oil. There's a
[22:42] pot of oil in our house this morning.
[22:46] And I believe we have the right pot of
[22:48] oil. We have the right vessel that can
[22:52] answer our need. Just there in your
[22:55] home, wherever you are. There's no
[22:58] moment like this moment. There's no
[23:01] moment like the present time you're in
[23:04] right now. As the apostle said
[23:06] yesterday, he said it's about the today.
[23:10] It's a fresh anointing. So why don't we
[23:13] pull down that fresh anointing when you
[23:16] go to work on a Monday, on a Tuesday, no
[23:19] matter what moment you're in. The fact
[23:22] that we saw the sun come up this
[23:24] morning, it's a new day. It's a new
[23:26] chance. It's a new opportunity to show
[23:30] the Messiah that we are alive. As we bow
[23:34] our heads this morning,
[23:37] gracious eternal heavenly father.
[23:41] Lord, you are wonderful.
[23:44] Lord, you are God, Lord. You are the
[23:48] mighty conqueror. You are the prince of
[23:51] peace. You are the lily of the valley.
[23:55] You are the bright, the morning star.
[23:58] Father, this morning we humble our
[24:00] hearts to your throne. We thank you that
[24:04] we could feel the brush of angels wings.
[24:07] We thank you Lord that we know which
[24:09] kingdom we belong to. We thank you this
[24:12] morning Lord that we know that our
[24:14] answer Lord is found in you oh Lord
[24:18] Father. And this morning we want to say
[24:20] that we love you. We appreciate you
[24:23] Lord. Lord as your people has gotten up
[24:26] this morning Lord to plead their case
[24:30] Lord. We realize Lord that we are in a
[24:32] ministry father that has the answer
[24:35] Lord. Lord we are in a ministry Lord
[24:39] that we know that we know that we know
[24:41] that you have made a way for us. Oh
[24:44] Father Lord you have called us oh Lord.
[24:47] Lord you have washed us Lord. You have
[24:50] made us whole Lord. And this morning we
[24:53] humble ourselves to your throne.
[24:55] Thanking you Lord that you are not just
[24:58] a God that we do not see but we feel you
[25:01] Lord. We see you Lord. We know that you
[25:04] are there Lord. And just to know that we
[25:07] have the opportunity this morning that
[25:10] we have the opportunity father Lord to
[25:13] come into your courts Lord with
[25:15] thanksgiving and a joyful heart. Lord,
[25:19] we are so grateful this morning because
[25:22] you are our God, Lord. Lord, we do not
[25:25] believe in fables, Father, but we know
[25:27] that there's a land beyond the river
[25:29] called somewhere, somewhere somewhere,
[25:32] Lord. And we want to say thank you this
[25:34] morning for your house, oh Lord. We want
[25:37] to say thank you this morning that you
[25:39] are God, Lord. Lord, you are so
[25:42] wonderful. You are so kind. You are so
[25:46] gentle. You are our savior. You are our
[25:50] king Lord. And this morning we humble
[25:52] ourselves to your throne. Knowing Lord
[25:55] that our strength, knowing that our joy,
[25:59] knowing that a brand new touch is in
[26:02] stock for us this morning, Lord. Lord,
[26:05] and we cannot sh to declare that you are
[26:08] with us, Lord. Lord, we cannot help
[26:10] ourselves this morning because we
[26:13] realize, Father, that you made a way
[26:16] through it all. Through it all, through
[26:18] it all, Lord, when we were at our
[26:20] lowest, you came our way, Father. And
[26:24] this morning, we want to say thank you,
[26:26] Lord. We want to lift you higher. We
[26:29] want to lift you even the more because
[26:32] you are a good God, Lord. Lord, and you
[26:35] are a wonderful God, Lord. Lord and you
[26:38] are a blessing in our lives, Lord. Lord,
[26:42] we do not want to just leave you one
[26:44] side, Father. But we want to embrace you
[26:47] this morning. We wanted you to come and
[26:50] kiss each and every heart in each and
[26:52] every home. May you come with a fresh
[26:56] anointing. Lord, may you come and visit
[27:00] El Tabernacle this morning, Lord. Lord,
[27:03] we want to say you are God. You never
[27:06] changed. We want to say that you are our
[27:09] Lord and you never change, Lord. Lord,
[27:13] you are still the same this morning. You
[27:16] are still the same God in our lives. And
[27:20] we want to lift you higher this morning.
[27:22] We want to give you the Tahilas this
[27:24] morning. We want to give you the toas
[27:27] this morning. We want to say, Lord, even
[27:30] so, come Lord Jesus. Because in you
[27:33] there's life. In you there's another
[27:35] chance in you, Father God. There is
[27:38] there is there is something Lord in the
[27:42] nothing. Oh Lord, there is always
[27:44] something in nothing, Lord. Lord, you
[27:47] are always there when we least expect
[27:51] it, Father. Lord, and your people this
[27:54] morning, we want to say we are your
[27:57] people, Lord. We want to say we love you
[27:59] this morning. We want to say we
[28:02] appreciate you, Lord. We want to say you
[28:04] are God this morning. Lord, we do not
[28:07] want to replace you. We know that you
[28:09] are a jealous God. Lord, we know that
[28:12] you are a jealous God. Lord, let us not
[28:15] put anything in your place this morning,
[28:19] but let us come with a made up mind that
[28:22] we know that we know that we know who
[28:25] our creator is, who our father is. Lord,
[28:29] you said ask and it shall be given unto
[28:32] you. You said knock and I will open the
[28:35] door. You said walk through the Red Sea.
[28:38] I will make a way, Lord. And this
[28:41] morning we know that there is a power
[28:44] from on high. We do not need a song this
[28:48] morning. We do not need anything from
[28:50] this world, but we have the answer. We
[28:54] have the oil. We have the anointing. We
[28:58] have the brush of angels wings. Father,
[29:01] this morning we humble ourselves. We
[29:05] speak the word, Lord, and we taking a
[29:08] positive step in the right direction,
[29:10] Father. Lord, may you forgive us where
[29:14] we fail you. May you try us out even the
[29:17] more, Lord, because we love you, Lord,
[29:20] because we want to be right, Lord. Lord,
[29:22] you said in your word that a Christian
[29:25] falls seven times. A righteous man, he
[29:29] falls, Lord. But we know the answer,
[29:31] Father, this morning. We know that we
[29:34] just got to get up again. We know that
[29:36] we just got to dust ourselves off and
[29:39] you will step in, Lord. You will bless
[29:42] the upkeep, Lord. You will bless the man
[29:45] of the house, Lord. As we look to your
[29:47] servant, Father, as we look to this
[29:50] ministry, Lord, we know that the hope
[29:53] that we have, it make us not ashamed.
[29:56] This morning we know that we have a
[29:58] hope. This morning we know that we have
[30:01] the answer. This morning Lord, there is
[30:04] no devil in hell that can keep a child
[30:07] of God bound because we know where our
[30:11] power comes from. We know where we come
[30:14] from and we know where we are going to
[30:17] this morning. Set the people free this
[30:20] morning. On the Sunday morning. on the
[30:24] Sunday morning, on the S O N. Lord, may
[30:29] you walk in our lives. May you ride in
[30:32] our lives, Lord, as the son of
[30:35] righteousness with healing in his wings.
[30:38] Lord, if there's someone this morning
[30:40] that needs healing this morning, Lord,
[30:44] if there's someone that needs a touch
[30:46] this morning, Lord, if there's someone
[30:49] that needs your heart to come to them
[30:52] this morning, Lord, may you open up the
[30:56] windows of heaven, may you open up the
[30:59] windows of heaven this morning, sister,
[31:02] my brother, may you touch the hem of his
[31:05] garment. He's not too far. He's not too
[31:08] far to hear your heart's cry as you
[31:11] touch him this morning. My sister, my
[31:14] brother, he's there. He's there. He's
[31:16] there. Lord, if there's someone this
[31:18] morning that needs a brand new touch,
[31:21] may you touch them even the more. May
[31:24] you come their way. Lord, if there's
[31:26] someone that needs a job this morning,
[31:29] Lord, may you come and may you
[31:32] intercede, Father. May you open up a
[31:35] company for that person, Lord, because
[31:38] you are still a creator, Lord. You are
[31:40] still a provider. You are still Jehovah
[31:43] Shabba, Jehovah Ni, you are still God
[31:47] this morning, Lord. I pray if there's
[31:50] someone that needs a brother and a
[31:53] sister, Lord, and doesn't know which way
[31:55] to go, may you help them to find you on
[31:59] their knees, Lord, as you reveal to them
[32:02] in prayer, Lord. May the signs come
[32:05] through. May the signs and the wonders
[32:07] come through because what God has put
[32:09] together, let no man put us under, Lord.
[32:13] You know who that brother and that
[32:15] sister is. May you be Lord with every
[32:19] brother, every sister that has a mind
[32:22] battle this morning, Lord, Lord, that
[32:25] doesn't know where they are, Father. May
[32:27] they make up their minds. May they look
[32:30] to the cross. May they look to the
[32:33] strength, Lord, in that Holy Ghost dove.
[32:36] Lord, may you open up heaven for them
[32:38] this morning, Lord. If there's anyone
[32:41] that's afflicted with demon oppression,
[32:44] with demon oppression this morning, may
[32:47] you come their way, may you be, Father
[32:50] God, the powerhouse this morning.
[32:54] Because Lord, we know where our power
[32:57] lies, oh Lord. Lord, we know which
[33:00] kingdom we come from. We know that on
[33:04] Saturday night, Lord, you went down to
[33:07] hell, Lord, and you kicked open the
[33:11] door, Lord, and you took the keys of
[33:15] hell, death, and the grave, Lord. There
[33:18] is no devil. There is no demon that you
[33:22] haven't seen before. Lord, there is no
[33:26] demon in hell that you do not know.
[33:30] Lord, when you were on earth, you came,
[33:33] Lord. And the demons cried out. Have you
[33:37] come to torment us already, Lord? They
[33:40] know you.
[33:44] They know you, Lord.
[33:46] Lord, and I know they know us, oh Lord.
[33:50] They know the power in this church. They
[33:54] know the power in this man. They know
[33:57] the power in the vessel because there's
[34:00] only one vessel of oil. Lord, may the
[34:04] oil. May the anointing
[34:08] break the yoke as the anointing breaks
[34:11] and it breaks and it breaks, Lord. May
[34:14] you break it this morning, Lord.
[34:17] Whatever they going through, whatever
[34:20] they facing, may you break the yoke of
[34:23] the enemy in the name of Jesus. In the
[34:27] name of Jesus. Jesus. Jesus. There's
[34:31] only one name. There's only one name,
[34:35] Lord, that shakes, Lord. And we know, we
[34:39] know, we know, we know that you've come
[34:42] down. You've come down. You've come down
[34:45] to bless us, Lord, to commute with us,
[34:49] Lord. You've come down, Lord. May you
[34:51] bless your children. Bless El
[34:53] tabernacle. Bless us even the more
[34:56] because we know where the power comes
[35:00] from. We know it comes from the head,
[35:03] even the head of Aaron, the high priest.
[35:07] I pray that the blessing may flow Lord
[35:10] from this priest Lord the apostle of God
[35:15] Lord your vessel for this hour your
[35:18] messenger your messenger of the latter
[35:21] rain there is coming another ball there
[35:25] is coming another message bleeding eagle
[35:29] and Lord we are loving in the
[35:31] manifestation of the prophecy Lord our
[35:35] eyes have behold
[35:37] Lord, our eyes have beheld. You have
[35:40] come down. And we want to say as El
[35:43] tabernacle, Lord, you've called us for a
[35:46] time like this. You've called us for a
[35:49] man like this. You've called us to stand
[35:53] upon the promises of God. Lord, if my
[35:57] mother doesn't want to do it, if my
[35:59] uncle doesn't want to do it, I will
[36:01] stand. Lord, Lord, we're not looking to
[36:03] the left. We're not looking to the
[36:05] right, but we are holding on to the
[36:08] promise of God because we know where the
[36:11] power comes from. Lord, may you set
[36:14] free. May you set free this morning. May
[36:17] you set free. Set free. Set free in the
[36:20] name of the Lord Jesus Christ. We love
[36:23] you. We love you. We appreciate you. We
[36:27] thank you, Lord, for a vessel. We thank
[36:30] you for the oil. We thank you for the
[36:34] house. Lord, we know that we have found
[36:39] someone that can stand between the
[36:41] pillars. They can stand between the
[36:44] pillars, the seven pillars, the seven
[36:47] thunders, Lord. And he knows how to
[36:49] handle the word. Lord, we want to say
[36:52] thank you. We want to say thank you that
[36:55] in this house there is seven pillars. We
[36:57] want to say thank you that we have the
[37:00] pot of oil in the house. We want to say
[37:03] thank you that we know who we are. We
[37:06] want to say thank you that we are not
[37:08] shaking. We are not shaken, Lord, but we
[37:11] are standing on the promises of God. May
[37:14] you come and deliver the young people
[37:16] this morning. Lord, may you come and set
[37:18] them free. May you come and do something
[37:22] exploits in their lives. Lord, may they
[37:24] know that they know that we are not just
[37:27] soul, but we are an army. We are the
[37:30] sons and the daughters of God. May you
[37:32] bless the church. May you bless every
[37:35] brother, every sister. Lord, we love you
[37:38] this morning, Lord. We appreciate you
[37:40] this morning. You are our God. Lord, in
[37:44] you there's life. In you there's another
[37:47] chance. In you there's a sweet
[37:49] anointing. In you there's a fresh touch.
[37:52] In you there's hope. And we want to say
[37:54] thank you. We want to say thank you. We
[37:57] want to say thank you. We want to say
[37:59] thank you. We want to say thank you. We
[38:01] want to say thank you once more, Lord.
[38:05] Just once more, Lord. Just once more,
[38:11] Lord. As Samson cried out, Lord, just
[38:14] once more, Lord. A fresh touch, Lord. A
[38:18] new anointing, Lord. Just once more,
[38:21] Lord. Just once more. Just just just
[38:25] once more. May you be with us. May you
[38:28] touch us this morning, Lord. As we feel
[38:30] your anointing, as we feel the presence,
[38:34] Lord. It is not something that we can
[38:36] wake up. It's something that's within
[38:38] us, Lord. Something that's pushing out,
[38:42] Lord. It may push out this morning. In
[38:45] every home, in every situation, may the
[38:49] angel of the Lord push through. Push
[38:52] through. La
[38:55] just push through the mud. Just push
[38:58] through. Push through. Just push through
[39:00] this morning. You just about to see the
[39:03] sun. You're just about to see the sun.
[39:06] Why don't you push through this morning?
[39:11] He's
[39:15] all you need. He's all I ever needed.
[39:19] He's a wonderful God. He's the mighty
[39:23] conqueror,
[39:24] the prince of peace.
[39:29] We love you this morning, Lord.
[39:32] We appreciate you this morning. We want
[39:35] to say thank you, Lord, for the Holy
[39:37] Ghost. We want to say thank you for the
[39:41] vessel this morning. We want to say
[39:44] thank you that you've come our way in
[39:48] the good times, in the bad times. Lord,
[39:51] we feel like Job of old, Lord. Job,
[39:56] Lord, no matter what he was going
[39:57] through, no matter what happened, Lord,
[40:01] he said, I know that my redeemer loveth,
[40:05] Lord, and we know that we have a hope
[40:07] this morning. We know that we got a hope
[40:10] this morning. We know there's more
[40:12] that's found in you, Lord. No matter
[40:15] what comes our way, no matter what the
[40:17] enemy puts in front of us, we are not
[40:20] going to deteriorate this anointing,
[40:22] Lord, we're going to keep it, Father.
[40:26] There's just a little oil left, Lord.
[40:28] Lord, may we embrace it this morning.
[40:31] May we kiss it this morning. May we
[40:34] embrace it even the more, Lord. We found
[40:37] it, Lord. It has found us, Lord. Lord,
[40:41] we are your people, Lord. called by your
[40:44] name, Lord. And in your name there is
[40:47] hope, Lord. Lord, we want to say thank
[40:50] you this morning. Thank you for your
[40:53] anointing. Thank you for your anointing.
[40:57] Thank you for your vessel, Father. You
[41:00] be with us this morning. May you be with
[41:02] every brother, every sister. Lord,
[41:05] whatever we going through, we want to
[41:08] also say thank you Lord for all your
[41:11] blessings. Father, if we can only sit
[41:14] back and realize what you've done in our
[41:17] lives, Lord, if we can only take a halt
[41:21] this morning and sit back and look at
[41:24] the hand of the Lord in our lives, Lord.
[41:27] You've done so much for us. You've come
[41:30] our way, Lord, and we are still here. We
[41:34] are standing on the promises, Lord. May
[41:37] you be with your people. May you be with
[41:40] El Tabernacle. May you be with every
[41:42] brother, every sister, every brother,
[41:45] every sister. Lord, may you know, Lord,

[41:51] hearts this morning. Lord, may you open
[41:54] up heaven, Lord. May you smile on us
[41:57] today, Lord. I can imagine how heaven
[42:01] feels when they see a true son and a
[42:05] daughter of God worshiping you because
[42:09] that's your answer. That's your your
[42:12] weakness. It's the worship of El
[42:15] Tabernacle this morning that kisses your
[42:18] heart, Lord. Lord, and you give us back,
[42:21] Father God, a fresh anointing because we
[42:26] worship you, not just by word, Father,
[42:30] but by the spirit within us, Lord,
[42:32] manifested this morning. We want to say
[42:35] thank you for your anointing. We want to
[42:39] say thank you for this apostle. We want
[42:42] to say thank you for this church. We
[42:45] want to say thank you for your sweet,
[42:48] sweet, sweet anointing. Lord, we love
[42:51] you. Lord, we appreciate you. May you
[42:54] come by. May you come by. Come by.
[42:59] Someone is calling you. Come by, Lord.
[43:03] Just the once more. Just the once more.
[43:06] just the once more. Lord, we love you
[43:09] this morning and we appreciate you. We
[43:12] are thankful. We are blessed. We are not
[43:16] deteriorated.
[43:18] We know who we are. We know who we are
[43:22] this morning. Lord, may you bless your
[43:24] people. May you be with us and may you
[43:27] come and visit each and every home in a
[43:30] mighty way. Lord, may we ride on last
[43:33] night. May we ride on this anointing,
[43:36] Lord, cuz we are a chosen people, Lord,
[43:40] that can handle the word, Lord. A group
[43:43] of people, a special group, a special
[43:47] group that can handle, Lord. There will
[43:51] be people that will stand with the oil.
[43:55] There will be people that will stand
[43:59] with the oil. And we are one of them
[44:01] this morning. We want to come and say
[44:03] thank you, Lord. We want to come and say
[44:06] thank you for the anointing. Thank you
[44:09] for the anointing, Lord. The Holy Ghost,
[44:13] it is in us. It is everything. It is
[44:17] with us, Lord. May we continue to look
[44:20] for you. May we continue to kiss your
[44:23] heart, Lord, as you come to us, Lord.
[44:26] May you kiss us back, oh father, this
[44:28] morning. It is a love affair. It is
[44:32] another love affair. We love you this
[44:34] morning, Lord. You are our bridegroom.
[44:38] You are our king. You are our counselor,
[44:42] our father, our eternal thought. Lord,
[44:46] you are Zoe. You are the life of God.
[44:50] And we want to say thank you this
[44:51] morning that that life, that character
[44:56] is in your people, Father. We want to
[44:58] say thank you once again Lord. Once
[45:02] again, Lord, for this ministry, Father,
[45:06] that can open barren wombs that can heal
[45:09] us. Lord, we want to say thank you for
[45:12] that little boy that is no more a little
[45:15] boy. But we've seen the manifestation of
[45:19] that, Father. He's preached what Mother
[45:21] Brham has said. He's taken the C a
[45:25] little further, Lord. And we pray that
[45:27] we will stand with him this morning
[45:31] as his people. Everyone that has gotten
[45:34] up on this sunrise morning. Lord, may we
[45:37] not forget what we felt last night.
[45:39] Lord, may we not forget it's the
[45:42] anointing. Lord, may we not forget you
[45:46] are the one that has come to El
[45:49] Tabernacle. Lord, it's Christ in the
[45:52] ministry
[45:54] moving. Lord, we've seen you. Thank you
[45:58] for the angel. Thank you for this great
[46:01] vessel, Lord. Thank you, Lord, that
[46:04] you've come our way. And this morning,
[46:07] Father, as we look to the heavens,
[46:11] may you look our way, Father. May you
[46:14] open up every door, Lord, that the devil
[46:17] is holding bound, Father, from your
[46:19] children. May you be there, Father.
[46:23] Lord, correction
[46:27] from a pulpit
[46:29] is what we need, Lord.
[46:31] Lord, that's how we know you love us,
[46:33] Lord. Lord, and this is why we want to
[46:36] take the stand, Father. And if there be
[46:39] any wicked way in us, Lord, may you
[46:43] cleanse us this morning, Father. May you
[46:46] make us whole this morning, Lord. If
[46:49] there be any wicked way within us this
[46:51] morning, if there be any little thing
[46:54] that is not of you this morning, if
[46:57] there be any little thing that you do
[46:59] not desire, if it be our time, our
[47:02] energy,
[47:04] Lord, may you try us out once more. We
[47:07] ask forgiveness this morning. We ask for
[47:10] a fresh anointing. May you be with us
[47:13] through this week. May you go with us
[47:15] through this week as we reminisce Lord
[47:19] as we ponder on these things Lord and
[47:22] our hearts will say within us it was
[47:25] burning as he spoke to us Lord because
[47:29] only you can speak like that Lord only
[47:33] you have the language Lord only you know
[47:37] how to kiss our hearts Lord your voice
[47:41] your voice
[47:43] your voice Lord makes the difference.
[47:48] We want to say thank you this morning.
[47:50] May you come and be with us. May you
[47:53] come and visit us, Lord. May the
[47:56] testimony stand, Father. True. May you
[47:59] be with us, Father. Be with our
[48:02] leadership, Lord. Be with our apostle,
[48:05] Lord. Be with him that you strengthen
[48:07] him, Lord. Lord, as he has labored,
[48:10] Father, may you bless him this morning,
[48:13] Lord. Lord, and may you restore the
[48:14] virtue for our sake this morning, Lord.
[48:18] Be with our pastors, Lord. Senior Pastor
[48:21] Jonathan and Pastor Jude. May you be
[48:24] with them, Father, as they stand with
[48:26] the men of God. Lord, all the ministers,
[48:29] the pastors, Lord, Lord, the elders,
[48:32] Lord, the trustees, Lord, Lord, each and
[48:36] every office bearer, may they be on
[48:39] their post of duty working towards the
[48:42] kingdom of heaven, knowing Lord that we
[48:45] are not doing it for earthly things, but
[48:48] we have a goal. We have a a destination
[48:54] and that one goal is one life.
[48:58] One life. One life.
[49:01] Oh, hallelujah.
[49:03] Lord, may they know that in this life
[49:07] it's all about heaven this morning.
[49:09] Lord, may you ble with our church. May
[49:12] they come a sturdy, Lord, like never
[49:15] before. May they come a fresh anointing
[49:19] on each and every brother and sister,
[49:21] Lord. May they be so zealous. May they
[49:24] be so on fire. May they have the drive.
[49:28] May they have the zeal to do more for
[49:31] the kingdom of God. Lord, we give our
[49:34] time. We give our energy for so much
[49:38] nonsense on this earth. But Lord, as our
[49:41] tabernacle, we make a declaration this
[49:44] morning. We make a declaration this
[49:47] morning. Lord, once more. Try us out
[49:52] once more, Father. Just a once more,
[49:55] Lord. Just a once more, Lord. Lord,
