TRANSCRIPT
========================================
well good evening friends or good morning um I have said that I am uh going to count U the restoration of the Gloria and um the veterans that's there will be bringing back the restoration of the Gloria so I am not against that I just want to show in this in this video clip that I'm going to play to you that the restoration didn't take place and I just want show you that for 40 years up till now after the 20 um 2024 restoration of the Glorious meetings it's not back in any other Church what you're going to see here so I want to say this that I am not fighting this anymore because Monday my whole perspective changed as said we believe what we believe and Abigail your father believes what he believes we don't see what your father sees and your father don't see what I see that settled it for me because a thing that had me all was Ezekiel when you see somebody do wrong and you don't straighten him out he's blood is on your hands and that was since a young man that he had me that's why I was so bold but I told God now that thing is off me now everybody sealed in and everybody believed what they believe so I will not be going into these things anymore as far as speaking about their beliefs they can chop me with my beliefs it's fine I think I'm big enough to take it as I said with George Martin I'm not going to mention him again and I could have I could have blasted them now with a split you know but it's not my business that's their business they got to go on I must say that I had some people that went to the breakup Church of George Martin and U they did report back to me I I went as far as that you know I just wanted to know if I'm right so uh I hope that you're honest brother brandham says the gospel trumpet is blowing and it's the good news and it says the good news is the Holy Ghost is here he says how do we know it's yeah you watch how it works its manifestation and then he mentions one of the things which the other things I'll mention with my next message um one of the things it brings back is honesty to be honest so uh if the Holy Ghost is y back we're going to have honesty and I just want to be honest you look at deog Gloria what is deog Gloria you young guys you know and see if it going to ever be able to hand over de Gloria to you young guys thank you and I'm not fighting H you can come behind me and write me and say what you want to after this tap I'm finished I'm not going to answer you we cannot leave you and listen in 1983 84 when it happened in de Gloria it's in shock waves around the world that bright stirring it stirred the world Listen young people you may not realize this what happened here in South Africa and mind you Kimberly bar is actually the center of South Africa few kilometers down the road there's a pole there they believe that's the center of South Africa so God chose the center of South Africa C the bride here to meet us here to have literal they seen the fire the fire fell people were slain anointed filled with the Holy Ghost amen and uh it went around South Africa around Africa it hit America they took it back South America Allelujah Europe amen Germany all places of the world Amen the anointing from de Gloria went is that right by the way it went around the world from here so we are happy we're not bragging but we're happy to say God chose us we represent the Bride of South Africa we representing the bride and Africa we're representing the bride around the world this morning as God saw it fit to start here with the outpouring of the Holy Ghost unprecedented anointing that happened here in 84 unprecedented aen the world that to recognize that what can we say my God Amen a brother in my church had a dream on December 2nd that twice a Thursday and December uh 1st and he had a dream that uh it was in a like a like a hot place and brother Musgrove brother rusco and myself were there was very warm like South Africa or the tropics he and there he was sealed which was back in New York and he said but there he was seal and he seen the cloud and Three Angels like like smoke coming down here they are amen and it had the dream two times and charity poured out at the last day the holy spirit is here now and God has confirmed it what can we say bless the Lord the eyes that see and the ears that hear we are here we are here we are here praise God Amen now you have heard what brother woman said the Gloria actually didn't just start it started with a dream a vision that um brother mazov myself and brother Coleman uh was in the tropics hot place de your Gloria as brother Coleman was saying and uh Three Angels dropped down and and he showed you the photo now if you can make up your mind this is what bog Gloria is brother colan and myself mainly brother mazra wasn't here in 83 I think and 84 he came I think and um then we were together but the thing started with brother colan and myself that is the Gloria by a vision that's why we had the meetings there you can make up your own mind what you think it is the Angel was first cited at El Tabernacle in Johannesburg before the Deo Gloria convention in this video brother Coleman clearly experienced his first genuine touch during a significant outpouring of the Holy Spirit following this sister's testimony she shared her encounter with the mighty angel of God during another meeting in Johannesburg sister bapsy was the first witness to confirm that the Angelic visitations did not begin at the Deo Gloria convention instead she had multiple encounters with the angel while staying with the late sister Moses in Johannesburg see aen from Johannesburg she has a testimony that Sheen the angel of [Applause] the you say but brother can we see angels listen your man read the book of Acts in the book of Acts there was Angels te in all chapter and the Heart being rest back it's Angel time again um again I don't have to explain anything here brother Owen was interpreting the sister with cut off the the tape it's on tape we have it on the other tape and um he uh interpreted it and said well the angel was first seen in Johannesburg before de Gloria I don't have to say much and I don't want to say much so you make up your mind and you believe what you want to believe but this is de Gloria I greet you all in the precious name of our Lord Jesus Christ I've never ever experienced the supernatural yet until this morning I was just sitting there and a sister came up and she gave her testimony that she seen an angel I was sitting there I just raised up my hand closed my eyes just to worship and through my closed eyes behind OE I saw I saw a big guy standing behind him standing Head and Shoulders above him dark colored long hair [Applause] [Music] Barefoot now after sister bubs on on the tape has testified and own testified um while she was there there that same angel that sister BB was speaking about and uh brother Owen was speaking about brother sh saw him on the platform and he gave a testimony yeah and um I just like the way brother Becket was actually aiming uh uh brother Schubert on this very issue here you know if you have if you have the tape you can just rly back and you'll see brother back at at the back there shouting amen hallelujah so that big Angel was prevalent and present right after Bubsy has testified about the angel being in Johannesburg first so you make up your mind what you believe and then I just want to interject here why we um I'm playing this so that you can say don't come from me now the angel of the Lord was first saw in 1979 in Johannesburg then I never told Brother K nothing then we had the coronationville uh Crusade with brother Coleman when he came and he saw that angel and his presence then Coleman called me one side it's like brother Vick said the behind the scenes things then he says brother Rosco when did this happen so I said no October month it happened and then uh brother Becka came and asked me to dedicate his church and I prayed because I didn't know if this was right or wrong and I told the Lord if this Holy Ghost Falls in brother becket's Church then I will never side away from it I said brother Coleman then it did fall in Becka church we have the video of it and uh from Beckett's church then coronation happened where the same thing happened and the people that stayed around the coronationville hall saw smoke coming out and they found the police so the Holy Ghost came down 1979 before deog Gloria 5 years before the GL de Gloria meetings or 4 years before the Gloria meetings all all depends if you take it 83 or 84 and then I want to remind you we're going to play a small Club of 1981 in P Elizabeth when brother Coleman came up and um what happened there so we just want to show you how the Holy Ghost got a hold of brother Coleman when when it was said about the angel of the Lord in [Applause] Johannesburg the mechanics back charity we pray this morning dear God May the young people may you smile upon the testimony may you see them [Applause] away Oh Glory [Applause] Glory Hallelujah HJ receive now here again this is the glory where ministers receive the Holy Ghost now where are we going to have meetings like this yeah brother Coleman the one who brought the Thunders the originator of the seventh Thunder Seven Virtues got so full of the Holy Ghost that he danced and I also got the Holy Ghost there and Owen and them said they got the Holy Ghost there and we'll show you just now brother SMY of Sanai how he got the Holy Ghost there now do glorious to do not only with the people but with ministers receiving the Holy Ghost so you make up your mind and think are they going to get restored back here and we will play just now what own said 40 years it's gone we'll say something on that I like to feel the Angels behind me I want of feel the seven angels in [Applause] them I want to feel the waves of Glory coming from behind me and from in front of me the last time I was on this platform I preach to seven Thunders I thought I was in the graveyard but this time I feel like I'm in glory [Applause] no more graveyard the seven sons is not [Applause] dead now again it raises question marks it was said that the the seven Thunder inspiration brought the Angels but here brother Coleman says when it came that was 1981 brother own is sitting right at the back in P yeah you know and just before that he came from Johannesburg so he said the first time he came and preach the seven Thunders graveyard now how could brother Coleman that preach the seven Thunders say he came to a graveyard when he came but now you feel the angels of the Lord behind it because he preached in Johannesburg in 1979 when the Angels Came now you make up your mind because you sure heard that they say the seventh Thunders uh uh uh inspiration 7th 7 inspiration brought the Gloria the says when he came it was a graveyard it was a graveyard and it was a graveyard it was a graveyard but when he came 79 he told is going to take this South African worship and it was not South African worship 79 it was El tacle worship and it's still Al Tabernacle worship back to New York City and then what did Joey sing No American SP what initiated in the Gloria or in Johannesburg so that whole thing falls through the Met because Coleman says when he came it was a graveyard he preached and he tried to preach the seven Thunders you make up your mind everybody I I'm I got to the place now that um I really appreciate what brother said you know your father believe what he believes and we believe what we believe believe you know so we see it different than what he's seen it and he see it different than what we see it I have come to the conclusion of that I am not going to fight anymore because I believe we're all sealed off in what we believe there won't be anymore speaking about seventh and Seven Virtues if you believe it it's up to you but I am this video just to show you what the Gloria is all about and you know I can't say much because Jean already blasted the thing you know and real bad so I'm not going to blast this thing I just want to show the young guys like Vic said we're going to hand over the pattern now what type of a b are you going to hand over with what brother Owen says there was a law for 40 years yes so we don't just want the word restored we want the power restored we want the Holy Ghost restored we want the supernatural restored amen hallelujah went through aoud and so forth 40 years and it's still AOW after now we don't have this that we see in here on this video it's only seen in alter anle and I'm sorry to say so if it hurts you I'm sorry but it is a truth that it's only only found in Al anle that angel never left us it's still here so I am not fighting I am showing the young guys the truth [Applause] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] refilling all the baptism of the Holy Ghost Lord reform me tonight bre for me tonight Lord God give me a brand new touch tonight Hallelujah [Applause] [Music] [Applause] amen Lord here am I do not pass me Lord while on other th calling do not pass me by Lord I need a touch from you tonight Lord I'm feeding that Camel Lord I want to write it now I want to write it Lord I want to write it I want to write it [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] Hallelujah the angel of the Lord is in the camp he's here as brother Brenham says in God's Eagles he stands next to [Applause] [Music] [Applause] you okay now this is been Harris in October month before de Gloria and here we already speaking about the angel before the Gloria you know so the problem is is now was the angel first saw in deog Gloria or long before theog Gloria because this is not P Harris before the Gloria October 83 this happened in the states and there's the same Angel the same worship so how come it is not here now and it's not it's not in the Gloria point one and it's not in pen Harris anymore and I want to say this I'm sorry to say it is it because Edgar Rosco left and I'm going to play you a clip of our December convention and even the last combined meeting where everybody saw on Saturday how the Holy Ghost poured out with nobody in the pit no band playing nothing just the angel of the Lord moving for over an hour on the people so it sto with us it left Coleman it left pen Harris it left um uh uh uh de Gloria and I'm quoting brother Omen pal which he honestly said for 40 years and it is 40 84 to 2004 is 40 years judgment No Angel no Holy Ghost no pouring out like this whatsoever so you make up your mind again I am not fighting you know any fool can see it black and white I got all the tapes I got all the tapes you know and I got all the full tapes I'm just playing you little shots because we're handing over the Batton to the young guys they must see what the pattern is that they need to run with this is the pattern [Applause] [Applause] oh [Applause] what can we say Amen the intelligence is here that's not a man that's the Holy Spirit that's here now amen praise there was a binding spirit in here the there was a hole in back and God used his servant to bust a thing it's free now Glory the Holy Spirit has now to baptize you tonight amen praise God I feel the same anointing that was in Holland Saturday night is here now it's only 8:25 this may be your day this may be your night oh hallelujah praise God that same God that came down in the upper room on 120 Souls that same holy spirit is here tonight praise God to seal your way into the kingdom of God don't you back up now come on praise God Press Your Way Hallelujah glory to God praise His Wonderful Name the holy spirit is here oh praise God hallelujah my my let's have a word of prayer almighty God In The Name of Jesus Christ we pray for them now father this is the Holy Ghost night there's many in here that want to be married to the lamb Glory let us be glad let us rejoice for the marriage of the Lamb is come amen and father in order to be wife we have to have an experience oh God come down tonight and give him a old Backwoods sky blue sin killing experience of the fire burning the demon out of the Soul tonight May the holy spirit in fire the pillar of fire come down tonight Glory the intelligence hallelujah praise God and come into people's souls and burning out tonight Lord God May the Holy Spirit pour out tonight and seal the people away in the kingdom of God hallelujah that they might be ready for the call to the mar supper Glory let us be glad and rejoice praise God God for many shall be sealed in the name of Jesus Christ we ask a blessing amen and amen Oh [Applause] [Music] Glory my let me share something with you with the Saints down in Guyana in Bur beast and how they I thank God for this little group holding out they don't want none of those pastors coming around that's against the Thunders and so forth they want brother Brown's message precious brother in Christ God bless you and greetings to you the past and all the Believers in the the name of the Lord Jesus Christ trus in the Lord that you and all the other Bethlehem dwellers from the local Christian Assembly are pressing towards Perfection praise God no Pastor last week we had a combined Fellowship service with both groups of Believers here in furnish uh furnace a furnish we listen to the marriage of the Lamb by God servant brother rasal before the message even was through the Believers went on for hours watering the camel brother rasco's message way down in Guyana South America my praising God for ours on on their knees we raise up from our knees with a new vision and a determination to press with all our might to Perfection God is already here that Joseph is here I got refilled brother we are convinced we heard straight from the Throne of God our lives have changed we can never ever be the same everyone is desperate and now on expectation waiting for his or her day to be sealed away the season is here and no devil can stop us so what can I say this is before de Gloria and the angel of the Lord was here and went down to guania and Bless the people for hours there so how could de Gloria produce the angel of the Lord and from the Gloria around the world how can it be here it is before the Gloria and uh I clearly remember how dead this meeting was in penis like brother Coleman said again this is a seventh Thunder meeting and it was dead at a breakthrough and it wasn't the first time twice it happened in colan's church that the church was dead and it took me 6 minutes for the Holy Ghost to come down and visit and then keman came back in in in in in Flores Hill and said this place was dead you can put brother Rosco in a graveyard when he start praying and preaching the dead will rise up and say Amen because we couldn't move you guys here again in pen Harris it was dead that's com's own words then who brought this Angel there again before the Gloria and that angel went right down to guania the same Angel before de Gloria now that's why I said you make up your mind am I lying colan lying or was it lies last year in the Gloria 2024 who was it lies who who's lying I leave it to you I'm not I'm not perturbed anymore because I don't want to speak about these things anymore like I said I finished with George Mar I don't speak about him I never spoke about him again even if you had that big big a breakup and the things those people are saying the same people that was against me and wrote all that commments against me was the same people that's now Downing George Martin so I don't have time for these people they now with you tomorrow they dump you like a hot potato the way they dump brother tum down there I don't even have to go into that so again this is the Gloria the Gloria was still going on before theog Gloria and after deog Gloria we still have a de Gloria in Al Tabernacle and everybody knows that you make up your mind I don't care anymore we believe what we believe and Abigail your father believe what he believes you know so there's where we are now we're all sealed in and what we believe everybody's sealed in on what he believe we'll see when we get Yonder who was right and who was wrong if I'm wrong I'm gone so you make up your mind I'm playing you the videos I got all these videos and I mean by now Raymond must know that I'm sitting with all the old radio or all the old uh uh tapes so I can go scratch them out whenever I want to if I want to know what rock um brother um uh Mike and them when they were with us and Monty what they said way back there I just going to take the tapes out and I can play it so that they can hear with their own words but now you have 2024 theog Gloria and you have that words and now you have these words you can pay it up it's not my business anymore you know I told every girl after I heard well we believe what we believe you believe what you believe that settled it for me even if I catch a pastor in bed with a woman I'm not going to say anything I'm going to walk on Hallelujah the angel is here now close your eyes and say Lord seal me Lord Fill Me This Is Your Night this is the visitation 1983 GL Hallelujah the angel of God himself is here hallelujah Glory hallelujah hallelujah thank you Jesus Hallelujah [Applause] [Music] Jesus Loves [Applause] Me we pray this morning de God young people when you smile upon the testimon hands when you see them [Applause] awaiting was the Lord all the [Music] time he was [Applause] there all the waiting patiently so patiently and [Music] love he was there [Music] the he was [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] there praise [Applause] God and something told a brother to take another snap and he snapped to the sky there right here we have all the ministers that receive the holy ghost in the Gloria from that angel now why am i showing you this because this is what the Gloria is all about not only the people receiving the Holy Ghost the ministers from Goldman down if that don't get actually Revisited again then you can't have a restoration and the question comes the people is asking now why did it leave for 40 years why is this not seen nowhere in the world but in E Tabernacle I don't know it's up to you and my Congo Brothers you cross from me because I said the Holy Ghost left what did I mean by the Holy Ghost left this is what the Holy Ghost was all about this happened at Coleman de Gloria class room right in bis's church and across the world this is what happened but I don't see this no more so did hlyh leave if you don't see this anymore look at how many ministers here is drunk under the Holy Ghost where did you see this this needs to be restored how can we restore this if you don't have the right guys to build a Revival on you know what brother Braham says God get a man and he prepares him to build a Revival on him you know you need the man that God buil the Revival on and the moment of that left 84 then the whole thing fell into chaos according to brother Owen Palm 40 years and I thinkk Owen because he's honest okay I hope you not know what's handing over the pattern of the Glory it's a hell of a big beton it comes from a vision then into a classroom then into uh brother becket's church then into um the coronation convention then into the PE convention and America you know that is the Gloria that's the glory of God you can't have this I I agree with Jean you know we don't agree on a l of things but when he said this is not going to come back I agree with him so I believe what I believe you believe what you believe that is now the Criterion out Tabernacle we have come to a place that brother said you believe what you believe and I believe what I believe I want to see ministers being slain like this the last time I saw it was 50 to 100 ministers in Brazil with B this thing happened in the temp praise God you can be baptized with the Holy Ghost you can be sealed away Hallelujah you can grab a hole of the altar tonight praise God Amen Hallelujah Lord God my all is on the alt I'm waiting for the fire waiting waiting for the fire all over this place the angel of the Lord is seeing hallelujah praise God Amen hallelujah praise God the young people are sing outside praise God God is busy moving like a magnet [Music] [Applause] hallelujah oh hallelujah hallelujah praise God praise God the fir of God is here tonight oh Hallelujah the angel of God is here [Applause] hold on hold on don't let go tonight I will not let you go I will not let you go until you bless me praise God hallelujah hallelujah so Hallelujah s Hallelujah forever [Music] I pray your visitation of the angel in South Africa here he is Glory brother brandham did not have to come back the angel has come back himself Glory that angel is here now Glory he's sealing the people Glory you begin to pray Lord seal me Lord seal my children father don't let them so here we have The Minister's wives under the Holy Ghost I'm not speaking about the congregation I'm not speaking about I'm speaking about the ministers and the ministers wives that got folded up where is that is that going to come back you know I agree with you brother John I'm sorry I don't agree with you with many things but this is something different than anything else and the big question is why did it leave why did it leave brother Coleman why did he leave the seven Thunders why did he leave South Africa this very thing that started in South Africa it's up to you again to make up your mind no more me the precious of me me I'm going to have a good time after this and I'll believe that you can believe even a Jehovah Witness Doctrine and I told God I'll speak about it very very soon all the power of God is all over the place hallelujah thank God for anointed Minister amen edar Rosco do you know what edar means Ed means protector of property Hallelujah he is protecting the property of God you are God's Property he is protecting you that's why he's blasting you that's why s I'm hitting you hitting you hitting you [Applause] thank you Jesus thank you Jesus thank you Jesus after I came back from Johannesburg brother sister Hallelujah the very first the very first uh day after been back we had our Wednesday night service and I related to the dear ones what has happened what God is doing on the land brother sister you know what happened this Sunday morning after I came from the cross of Amen coming to preach the word of the Lord there was no time to preach amen hallelujah the Holy Ghost strike that place until the worship went on for three solid hours no time to preach the worship went on for 3 hours listen this is the hour for God's power and for the manifestation Hallelujah [Applause] Jesus loves [Music] me yes now yeah here we have brother theck and you might make out what he meant by saying those words he came from the r which is Johannesburg and he experienced it in Johannesburg not de Gloria Johannesburg now who's lying am I lying but fine you know this tape will be played at electron judgment to show where the thing actually happened and here brother even brother minty they lays on the floor he also as a minister received the Holy Ghost where are we going to have those days 40 years those days was gone and I stress it why did it leave Coleman pan Harris and de Gloria for 40 years why never again did they see this you know everybody says brother Oscar because you left and that's the truth I left 84 and from 84 there was nothing going on I went back after I went up there to brother um uh in Canada brother Ed bisco and uh I preached there and the Holy Ghost fell until 1:00 in the morning and uh I first went around there to Coman and them and when I sat there I told my wife she's gone she's gone and it was nothing there when we got up to to uh uh uh Canada there she was again so I'm asking you this is what the people pick up because it's all I got that of of what have happened in in Canada I got it on tape too you know we'll play it sometime and uh the same thing happened there a de Gloria happened there after years after de Gloria so now the problem again is why did it leave why is it gone what type of Aon are we leaving for the young men so young men if you don't see this then you don't have a restoration of the glor Ever from the vision of Ken who will be in the Gloria and it was proven by Three Angels you know so it will never be proven again thank you there brother I started tape service bruty I hired the hall I paid the sign the lease I bought the real and I picked up the people and started tape Services now I don't want to argue about who bought the reals Raymond all that I ask tell me from who did you buy the reals please don't make a mistake here from who did you buy the reals like you say I would like to know now remember Raymond I know the history of ative so don't make a mistake here from who did you buy the reals that's all that I want to know and then also even if you did that this is the quote that I would like the people to read brother say God don't work through Mechanical Devices he use human instrumentality we put tears that quot so it don't help us to go against the prophet you can't put a tape recorder on the street corner and expect people to come in people never came in with a tape recorder people came through human instrumentality just like God's Prophet said so I don't even want to query and argue that because s renica told me the same thing that you bought the reals and I knew it was not sold and all that I ask just tell us from who did you buy the real and as I was saying here is the two sets of tapes that I bought for Al Tabernacle she always had two sets of tapes now if Raymond had bought tapes where is he set this first set is still here that was totally hopeless that V done in the early couple of years of making tapes we only got fter tapes late when I bought the second for e e tacle so if he bought tapes for E tle where is the tapes I'm the pastor of el Tabernacle I know no tapes Raymond that you bought I was here before you point number one point number two Raymond I am the pastor and not you point number three I am your brother-in-law I frequent your house for many years I never saw a set of brother brandham stes in A's house never so I don't know what you're talking about but don't make a mistake remember the real to reals came out before the cassetes you said real to real I just want to know that because that will be my last encounter with you with a real to real and a real to real big tape that tape was so big I'm not speaking about a small tape recorder I'm speaking about the big one the real to real tapes with the real to reals I want to know where did you buy it from the reals and um that's why when they wanted to destroy the cassette tapes I said no leave it it might come up as witness one day and I never thought that will come up now after Sor reica said you said then I remembered I still have the tapes I still have the tapes now any common sense any person that's honest any real end time believer will automatically think if El tacle had two sets of tapes one from V and one filed why why did they need another one from Raymond Thompson that means we should have had three sets of tapes here you never had a set of tapes at home never a full set never I frequent your house so I'm not going to query that you can say you had but just tell me about the real to real so that I can tell the world because they're going to immediately know who's lying you on me from who did you buy the real to real as you said here now I was the pastor of el Tabernacle the next thing I want to ask you if you were so great with the tapes who stopped the tape you you were the the the maduna I sto that tapes I stopped the tape meetings you know why didn't you go on with the tape meetings because I was a pastor and I put a stop to it and I know why because I spoke with I think George vuk and we checked something out and we realize it doesn't work nobody got saved there wasn't one tape meeting that we had where where we LED somebody to the Lord not one so don't come and boast on things that is invalid tapes don't work yeah yeah they're trying push and tape it's not working why are you always busy brother Rayman with things that falls to the med always I'm not fighting I'm asking and uh you know uh the reason I just have to explain what is happening why are we having this convention you know I think it was about two years ago me and pastor and spoke and he just spoke that he says he wants to host a convention where all the young ministers can preach you know so I thought to myself you know the young ministers will always be there but I mean the elderly ministers we don't know how long we'll still have them with us so this convention we decided that we want all the veterans to preach to us at this convention okay uh brother Tim Timothy said that Raymond is initiated this convention and again another flop another flop because brother R comes back he says so happy is here de Gloria blah blah blah blah but he is happy because of a flop now how many times must a man flop pure flock that every minister is talking about this flock and he don't stop and the people still follow him I can't go on with this anymore as I said he believes what he believed and I believe what I believe zedekiah also believed that he's got a Holy Ghost and Mah don't have so I rest myself from now onwards with this but I still want to hear where you bought not the cassette the real to real tapes where did you buy it from Raymond don't make a mistake here thank you oh take my life take my thoughts Lord I don't want to worry about anything oh fill me with your Holy Spirit father fill me with your spirit Lord Lord We Worship You We Praise You Lord sweep over my soul Spirit of the Living God for fresh on me today Lord Break Me Lord melt me

there's the Holy Ghost nobody actually pumping nobody in the pit no musicians amen and here's the Holy Ghost here's the quote here's the manifestation you cannot argue it and nobody in the world can argue it it's still here so I thank you it's your problem now to work out who lied I want to also just put down here remember brother B say what make the people dance what make the people shout what he says a supernatural being in them you don't have to pump you don't have to ask please clap your hands please shout like you guys do in the Thunders say Amen say this you know it must be an automatic thing like in Al Tabernacle they shout because brother Braham says something tickles their nervous system to yell out and scream you don't have to whoop it up God pushes it out of the people automatically and that you only find in alter eckle everybody asked for a hand clap shout and all that that's not the Holy Ghost this is the Holy Ghost thank you I'm [Music] finished is Tru still
