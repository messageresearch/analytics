please [Music] and I feel free [Music] but you'll pray can mark the only one that can set you free foreign [Music] [Music] [Applause] well [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] foreign we are surely pleased with King Lord Jesus for giving us the opportunity again to be here in London I came down years and years to Cape Town and I never dreamed that one day I'll be coming to langa and Jonathan told me that it's steadily growing a minimum of people about 16 that's without hermanus I am I'm pleased to God as I said week before last walls dedication I said I nail down a peg when everything seems to go wrong and all the lies that has been told and if made people believe those lies I hit down the pig and I look at that pig Wherever I Go that Prophet visits South Africa page 80. when I stood in front of brother barana [Applause] and he laid hands on me [Applause] now now there's no other minister in South Africa that can say that it's only me [Applause] and then I hit down another Pig as I told the ministers up in joburg it's when bully Paul wrote me a letter and told me brother Roscoe I don't listen to anybody just my father and you I hit down that page [Applause] then I hit down another page with brother higginson the head deacon or brother or Branham Tabernacle came and visit us with brother Brown and after the service I could speak to him but during the service he told the people he says the last time I felt the presence of God like this is when brother Branham preached on this day the scripture is fulfilled that was a loss I felt it until now [Applause] now who's going to stop me who's going to stop me Nigeria Ghana Zambia Cape Town can't stop me I'm ordained from a prophet [Applause] and all the positives all of them can't say what I'm saying now [Applause] so so I didn't come down here Taking Chances I don't take chances because I know who I am I come down to Cape Town many years and I and the people in London came in because of the tapes and that made me come down here I come down here just to pull out some seeds because Billy Paul told me he said brother Roscoe I deserved you and you got one of the best spirits of all the ministers he said to me he said to me he he gave me a gift after I told my dad don't go to Cape Town if the angel of God told you not to go to Cape Town then don't go and he said that please the angel to wake me up to see the angel so I do not know why the angel didn't want to come down to Cape Town I think it's because they rejected the Holy Ghost and bless him did so I'm just looking for someone that will go with me [Applause] to my father's house [Applause] so we are here not by chance we are here to come encourage the ones that's walking with us in Cape Town they will never have what you have never [Applause] on the oldest guy in the message now brother Beckett and them all came afterwards when brother Becca left joburg he didn't even preach he was not even a preacher I learned the preaching I was here teaching him so how can he teach me how can I learn from somebody that don't know as much as I know he doesn't know what I know and I'm getting old and I don't like nonsense anymore I don't play church or churchy and I do not play with people's Souls so I bring greetings to El Tabernacle Johannesburg Victoria storm he bloomfontein the people that has called in from the USA Brazil Swaziland leidenberg mobile planning Cecil bug [Music] polokwane and uh and all my Pentecostal friends it's on the streaming may you be blessed two Pentecostal Brothers two weeks ago pastors walked up to me I said brother Roscoe we're following you on a stream although we painted coastals but we silent Believers in here I greet you my brothers your Baptist is listening to me I greet you I look forward to one day share the Holy Ghost with you [Applause] and over in Vendor may God bless you as you streaming tonight and I hope that the streaming will just make you walk closer to God that's all that it's all about as I said the storehouse we'll try to put the details on for years that don't have the details to sign on we'll put it on after the service and tomorrow morning and uh we hope that all those tapes I preached over 3 000 tapes so this will never run dry [Applause] now bully Paul and Joseph Brennan can tell all the ministers to switch on and press and listen to the tape but they can't tell me that brother Graham says this boy will preach exactly what I preach [Applause] brother Branham says I must preach [Applause] and I can't listen to them I must listen to brother Brennan [Applause] so may you be blessed and the few families in the USA that's listening in may God just come your way to another as you listen to it this broadcast so let us preach I hope you're going to have patience with me tonight I must see how far we get I do not know I got comments to make before I preach and if you've got a pen and PayPal write down what I'm going to say go back home we're going to check it up don't go to your pastor because he's gonna lie to you go look it and they came unto the brook of s call Brokers where the water flows and cut down from cinch a bunch with one cluster of grapes they bit off a branch just with one cluster of grapes that was not the whole branch that was part of the branch that they broke off and the Bible says and they bear it between two upon a staff two guys had to carry that bunch of grapes it was so heavy one couldn't two had to carry The Grapes of the Promised Land God doesn't change and they brought off the pomegranates amen and of the figs three types of fruit in the Promised Land have your church got this fruit in their church have you got these fruit in your church I'd like to take another scripture I'd ask you to be patient with me right Galatians 5. now that's the fruit of the land and the land is the Holy Ghost now if your pastor preached on the Holy Ghost and that fruit is not in his ministry then he's lying to you then he is a Baptist trying to pull wool over your face if he hasn't got grapes in his ministry then he's not called Galatians 5. and verse 22 but the Fruit of the Spirit let me say but the fruit of the land because the land is a spirit so the two scriptures goes together am I right is love joy now they say love love love love but love is only a fruit of the spirit the spirit don't come out of love love comes out of the spirit so get the spirit first because you say brotherly kindness brother don't come and tell Edgar Osco that because Edgar Osco want to see the holy ghost first then the fruit of the spirit love [Applause] otherwise he is not loved that man and out of love joy they love love love love love love but there isn't no joy in the church the pastor never danced around the pulpit yet but he speak about love and he's got no joy brother we have joy we have love and we have the baptism of the Holy Ghost [Applause] amen did you catch that I'd like to take Romans I didn't I didn't give this to you Edgar I just thought I'm gonna throw it in the air and read the scripture Romans 8. verse 23 first Romans 8 23. and not only then but ourselves also which what now what is the first fruit of the spirit love the Bible don't contradict itself then why is the pastors contradict themselves why does Bible Tabernacle lie like that let's take another one eight same Romans 8 I think verse 9. focus on this is already too much but you are not in the flesh but in the spirit it's so be that the spirit of God dwells in you not if any man have not the spirit of Christ he is none of his you don't even belong to Jesus even if you in Bible Tabernacle if you don't have the spirit you're none of his he's going to say turn around I know you not and they never had the Holy Ghost in Bible Tabernacle they never had an outpouring in Bible Tabernacle they never had a dance in Bible Tabernacle [Applause] that pasta never danced Hallelujah can you imagine brother Becca dance [Applause] but I saw brother Brennan dance [Applause] [Music] that's why longer stay where you are stay where you are [Applause] [Music] I think and the only one that can correct back it but he can't correct me amen I can show you where he's wrong let me tell you this just this before you said we went Florida and Bob Browns Church and brother Beckett only preached porber holiday like he now recently just preached van diyao and sing with dry Baptist Methodist songs that's why please give me a monster [Applause] and it was so dead in that church after Beckett preached brother Becca preached we went to the hotel and brother Becker threw himself on the bed he says you know brother Roscoe my church is dead but this church is deader I said Angel just write down what he says now [Applause] this word catch him just after he died just after he died that will come to him out of his own mouth his church is dead I went same thing happened church is dead he went on the Sunday morning was was he fell asleep I went in the evening and I made them laugh I made them I made them loose [Applause] and when Bob Brown's church was loose you know you sat right in front here every time you finish preaching don't close the meeting you don't say nothing what you preach you just turn around to the people and say you dismiss that was Beckett's right-hand guy that that was brother Beckett's Colonel of a guy I said I look at brother back and I said no what is this people with hats on but Beckett will go after that nonsense and thus is recorded in heaven and when I was finished and they were laughing and they were free I put in the Holy Ghost there [Applause] Hallelujah [Applause] so can brother Becca tell me anything out of his own multi-cities church is dead nobody can tell me anything I was here before they were again okay that's enough of that if I should entitle this a message tonight or to tell entitle it the fruit of the land the fruit of the land I have never heard anybody preach on the fruit of the land the pomegranates the honey the figs and the grapes all speaks about the Holy Ghost [Applause] [Music] he told Israel when you get in the land that's what you're going to get amen let's buy our heads father I've traveled a thousand miles or kilometers down here not to waste any time but to be glad to be able to work for you and not doing you a service but do everything that I do to show back into the Bible [Applause] may you a father look at the heart and please give us something to think about I ask it in Jesus name amen you may be seated [Applause] now as I said I've never heard anybody preach on the fruit of the land because the land's got fruit and he told them it's got fruit and we want to check that fruit up but before going in there I just got something to say before I start preaching I'd like to take Point number one and now let's see how many has discernment discernment is to be able to discern between two things right and wrong virgin or foolish virgin God or not God see if you got discernment quote but manifested quote it's good to quote but he said quote manifested in your church so I want to see as this gets streamed out who's got discernment where is the discernment it's to match up two things the right thing and the wrong thing so just for a couple of minutes let's see if Cape Town has discernment are they taking what their pastor says or what brother Branham says are they taking just a quote and not a manifested quote amen if you have your paint pins and papers to it right around the world I would like you to write down these quotes the first one is the middle is festered manifestation of thy Resurrection to the people of this day listen to that brother Brahm says there I can hear a noise a noise do you hear a noise in the churches in the message in Cape Town but brother Brown says I hear a noise I can imagine the poor blind beggar said it's this noise all about why does el Tabernacle make a noise what is this noise all about [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] now listen you know he tells us you know well I'm in Bible temp I'm in that Temple I'm in that type of and and I'm in you know but he tells you do you know that say that you're in the message you know usually where Jesus is there was always a little noise [Applause] foreign [Applause] it upsets the Baptist because brother Beckett comes from the Baptist um it always upsets the Baptist if there's a noise and I heard they said the last time I was here you can't you can't shout all the time who tell you you can't why do the cherubims shout day and night all the time [Applause] get behind me Satan [Applause] it's a little upsetting they get upset the Baptist in the message they get upset and you know for 57 years that I'm in the message they got upset but you think they could change me I had a pet down I had a peck done [Applause] couldn't stop me can't stop me will never stop me I will dance like David does [Applause] [Music] amen then he says why why a lot life comes in life what what brings a noise and you say you got life and there's no noise you're a liar because brother Branham says life brings a noise [Applause] foreign [Music] [Applause] churches get out of that synagogues of Satan get out where there's a noise [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] I believe the prophet and not Bible Tabernacle no I told you to have discernment could Bible Tabernacle take this quote [Music] then when you miss one word you're going to hell one word with all the Nigerians and whatever it is in your church you're going to hell miss this quote now when I like to say this I said discernment between the right and wrong now if you take the opposite of this good he says where there's a noise there's Jesus Jesus is there where there's a noise now the opposite if there is no noise is Jesus there [Applause] [Music] do you believe the prophet do you believe this quote then why don't they do it [Applause] I wonder can you do me a favor you turn around to one another and tell one another wherever Jesus is there's a noise [Applause] [Applause] foreign [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] foreign [Applause] [Music] [Applause] oh [Applause] my God [Music] [Applause] foreign [Applause] [Music] [Applause] you see I got a very little blacks from up ethical way Congo Zambia all very few I all got local blacks here because I got local black blood in there thank you shame on you you can't even give God the glory you sit there like a pope get out man get out [Applause] let us just say this did I just say this when light comes in life brings a noise now tell me is Jesus life is that what he says in Saint John 14 does he say that I am the [Music] [Applause] [Music] okay that was a quote in 1954. in case you want to know where it is it's your write you down so when a devil come to you I tell you don't make such a lot of noise you show him this quote [Applause] do you want another one let's take number two simonian Church 1960 1206 money in church look what he says I like a good now this is what your Prophet likes is not what Bible believers Baptist Prof uh Pastor like this is what the prophet William Branham likes he likes this he says I like a good what just hold it there the power of God Must Fall it mustn't be that the pastor goes up and he says let's worship God and then our theme and when he gets tired the whole church is tired it dies down no it falls and automatically there's a shouting there's a jumping that amen [Applause] [Music] [Music] through spruce man Bruce for tell me oh yeah but the prophet fellow do you like what the prophet likes [Applause] then you won't like Bible Believers you won't like that church if you like what the prophet likes and he likes when the Holy Ghost Falls not when he comes let's worship and when he gets tired everybody gets tired and assume there's no Holy Ghost that's not the Holy Ghost that's a Strange Fire amen we need fire all right [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] he says where the power of God is falling what does he say further can you read it for me holy I thought you must be quiet like brother Beckett you must be quiet no no no no no no no no no not evgar Roscoe I'll scream I'll shout I'll praise God I'll dance Hallelujah why the prophet light say it [Music] and you like it and you like it and you like it [Applause] [Music] some guys were sent to Elijah and Elijah says you'll go back go tell ayab Elijah is here you go back you can tell Beckett the good old schools here [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] it says you are screaming shouting praising God doing what langa are you having a good time foreign [Music] you preachers and now watch what he says but you but we you can't hear amen hardly anymore it's our man and back at you well Abraham says that's nonsense it's her amen it's a amen what's some feeling in it that's what he says [Music] can you give the devil a nice amen can't hear you [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] that's where this end time Church is this is only my commands I'm not preaching the message yet I'm too full [Applause] foreign number three the bridge between the seven Church ages and the Seven Seals well you know 1963. write down write down could you imagine Peter and James and John and then in the upper room saying oh we got the Holy Ghost like they say in Bible Tabernacle we've got the Holy Ghost we've got the Holy Ghost now but maybe we better keep stall a quiet Holy Ghost brother said maybe they they said we've got to have a a holy ghost without emotions there is no quote like that anyhow but Beckett and they made it a quote with valyria teeth but there is no quote like receiving the Holy Ghost without emotions I blasted that thing they don't even use it anymore and yeah brother Branham comes back he says you've got the Holy Ghost and you see we must keep still you don't have to be so excited you're making too much noise if you get a holy ghost my friend you're going to make a noise [Applause] [Music] [Applause] we should keep stall listen to brother Branham brother says brother in other words Hey Brother in Bible table Miracle brother wake up you're in the wrong place you're keeping stole while the chatterbombs is crying holy holy holy holy and you keeping stop [Applause] and this is in the seals what did they do through Windows imagine they climbed through Windows after receiving the Holy Ghost so emotional they were they went through the windows they went through the doors and everything they needed to go out and make a noise [Applause] they went out into the street [Applause] you think brother Beckett can do that he can't even do it in his church because he don't have the Holy Ghost I will stand at the day of judgment and judge him for rejecting the Holy Ghost [Applause] [Music] [Applause] I will be his judge [Music] play with fire play with your mother than to play with Edgar Oscar [Applause] they went through everything out into the streets doing what I don't hear you did you read it thank you I don't hear you that's that's viable Tabernacle act like a bunch of drunks then what are you doing there he says that's what the Holy Ghost does so if you don't act like a drunk man amen walking up and down and blubbering hey man he published you can't even hear him and his brother is hallelujah [Music] speaking in tongues a drunk man [Music] [Applause] just read that for me again acting can they still be in the message can Bible but Tabernacle still be in the message how many quotes did I give you that they can't perform struggling for 53 years since I'm in the message 57 years in fact and they will never get it if your pastor don't have it the church won't have it if the pastor can't be drunk how can the church be drunk if the pastor don't have it he can't give it but come to a pasta come to El Tabernacle come here where we have the dynamic Center mechanics [Music] [Applause] this is thus saith the Lord [Applause] because it's the quotes [Applause] how does he end this how does he end this quote can you end this quote for me [Applause] I don't hear you [Applause] so that's the real Holy Ghost not the quiet back at Holy Ghost that's Holy Ghost with a shouting and a jumping and a good time in the Lord and a joy unspeakable and full of glory and a half has never yet been told Amen brother a dancing Holy Ghost amen that's the real Holy Ghost thus saying the prophet not thus Saiyan brother Beckett thus saith William Branham [Applause] foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] foreign [Applause] [Music] [Applause] Jesus don't know it but I know the prophet but brother when he says you can know the prophet you can pay your tithes you can come to church you can quote call Will quote brother Branham he said but still you need the token if you don't have the token you'll die if you die because you're none of his [Applause] [Music] foreign [Applause] church church here in London just finish this quote again for me now there's only one baptism not true not Bible Tabernacle and El Tabernacle one of the two must be wrong who's wrong I don't hear you I don't hear you and who's right Tabernacle propose the quotation [Music] [Applause] [Music] foreign that's that's the appeal that's a Real McCoy man how do you say in xhosa for real ESO so Indiana [Applause] [Music] [Applause] you want more that's not my message it's my comments but it's more powerful than brother Beckett could ever preach when we're in a platform back again to sit at the back of me because I'm The Real McCoy because I bring the real genuine Holy Ghost the one that President speaks about foreign [Applause] I'm an apostle I need to

tastes he was not in the promised land he never carried the grapes amen the real fightful Ministry carried the grapes why should God let the real preachers come with grapes you make wine from grapes so the land is full of wine so God don't want any sober people he wants strong people he says in my land Allah [Applause] they drunk they carry those grapes staggering as they came hey man they stick it on at it brother Branham say you need to be drunk were you ever drunken Bible Tabernacle you say anybody ever drunk not with the Teaching Ministry but otherwise her teaching Minister he can't give you the Holy Ghost and check all her teachers they never got the Holy Ghost and they never gave out the Holy Ghost because brother Branham said so Becca is a dry preacher maybe he saved me just to tell you could this be the reason why the angel didn't want to brought brother Abraham to come to Cape Town they rejected the grapes the bishop rejected the grapes and the angel said Prophet you don't go there oh why Why did Why did why why didn't he want him to come here but he says get to Johannesburg there's a little boy there I want you to lay hands on him because he's my Apostle he's going to make this quote love and shake the world [Applause] can I pick Afrikaans proud foreign [Applause] he goes on the Virgin Mary like she was drunk staggering staggering means walking like this did you ever want to see brother Beckett or anybody I'm an arrow amen all those dead aim and Baptist in brother Packard's church ever walk like this but he says Mary did and they say they got the Holy Ghost you're a liar if you have the Holy Ghost you'll stagger you speak in tongues you will dance you will shout with a life of Jesus Christ [Applause] brother Beckett I am the apostle [Applause] [Music]

preacher told me brother Oscar you see you're a black guy your temperament and we white temperaments is two different things if you dance shout and all that which we don't condemn you it's your temperament but we want to be quiet check all the white churches they quiet I got off from I said this is your liar he says what do you mean I says when Elvis Presley cleaning and he made like this [Music] I said your woman got so mad amen they put their underneath clothing and threw it on they were shouting and jumping I said in a soccer matches sir Amen in England amen when when they score a goal those guys jump up but you'll come to the message we whites shame on you [Applause] same on you you lying [Applause] laughs [Applause] no I highlighted this I want you to read that highlight now that's the way that the church is ordained that's the way the church started Now read on his Bible his Bible Believers that kind of a church do they Shout do they scream with a life behind it they justify Sanctified but they never enter the Promised Land they got the Ten Commandments the 10 seals and all that but without the promised land they died in the wilderness and all in in Becca's church is gonna die because they that don't have desperate that brother pranam says is none of his not some good at temperament and others got that temperament don't work that way you want another one oh my my time is gone the Easter seal I believe that Pentacles began without an ending [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] oh the Indian s Bible Believers Tabernacle it ended there because he said a couple of years ago about 30 years ago he said he'd rather be a baptism a Pentecostal but here brother Brahm says it started without an end it's going on in langa right now [Applause] [Music] I believe it's to be to every creature all times all times all times now tomorrow Damon 100 years at 200 years 2000 years amen 3.5 billion years it's all the time Pentecost [Music] [Applause] all the time at all places the boats will be all over Ali Becca do you know why Ali placa do you know why Aldi placa but all in US is [Applause] [Music] all places that Pentecost should always remain yes they're in trouble Bible Believers is in trouble brother Beckett is in trouble [Music] [Applause] should always remain the Pentecostal blessing should be upon the people keep it upon the people keep Pentecost all the people amen don't ever take it away don't quench the Holy Ghost don't throw water on the Holy Ghost don't quiet the people down if they live the life then they're going to shout for victory [Applause] oh my I don't know what to do said the last one day okay let's go it's only my commands the sign of unbelief when God gave Solomon a great gift of discernment and all Israel rallied around it oh wouldn't it be a great day today if all the churches would rally around God's great gift the Holy Spirit would you not be wonderful if we just forget our differences and denominations and just realize rally around the greatest gift that God gave ever sent to the Earth the Holy Spirit his son died that he might come could you read the other one the holy spirit is greater and the Bible and Hugo on the prophet says the prophet said the prophet said the prophet says the Holy Ghost is greater than what the prophet said because the Holy Ghost wrote the Bible [Applause] it says you speak one word against he says you can speak against the word it will be forgiven him but speak against the Holy Ghost it will never be forgiven here [Music] by Christ came the spirit when they called him Balsam up he said you say that against me the son of man they quote the scripture I'll forgive you but when the Holy Ghost has come and does the same thing one word against it will never be forgotten forgiven in this world not the word to come and George Martin calls falling in the spirit they fall like monkeys when they dance they dance like Michael Jackson one word I don't care what you're saying the invoice it's goodbye No Redemption and how many words did that two guys speak against the Holy Ghost the minute they die they have to face this for what they said against the Holy Ghost it's one word against it will never be forgiven in this world not the world to come and this is a greater day than that was just a day now when God has poured out his spirit from Johannesburg right down to Cape Town right overseas it's a greater gift amen giving out the Holy Ghost over 40 countries people is under the spirit it's a greater day this day when he poured out his Spirit according to Joel 2 and I'll pour out my spirit at All Flesh it's a greater day than when brother pranam was here amen because the Holy Ghost has gone right around the world Amen and baptizing people amen the way brother Branham says the Holy Ghost is jumping and shouting and emotions thank you the Holy Spirit working universally in his church universally 40 countries it never happened with anybody that's stupid right here took it around over 40 countries I think I'm gonna close give it another one there's another one yep the Seal of God that's the way God does when he he sends his power down with the baptism of the Holy Ghost and he moved in right there and Away went the message Hallelujah and they shouted and screamed you mean when the message went down they shouted and screamed and spoke in tongues and went out there and that was the mark that God put upon the people that was the mark shouting and screaming that was the mark that God put on the people did he put it on you [Applause] then why are you so quiet [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] could you read the next line for me is that right when when you've been here in langa you mean right now that kind of a mark [Applause] do you understand why the shouting and the jumping is here and the speaking in tongues and loving the word not quoting the word and not be years of the word but doers of the word that's really the other lines the same seal what was the Seal of God shouting jumping screaming is that the seal if that angel come down here and he's here you're shopping and jumping and he seals in amen because that's the type of a seal there is no Baptist Bible Tabernacle sale two different seals there's only one seal and this will produce jumping and shouting and being drunk in the Holy Ghost [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] foreign [Music] [Applause] you can clap your hands it's all right [Music] [Applause] foreign [Applause] [Music] what type of seal is this Lord I do not know why you gave that girl the greatest thing in the Bible to complete the baptism of the Holy Ghost they try to tell me the Holy Ghost receive the Holy Ghost
