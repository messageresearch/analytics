TRANSCRIPT
========================================
when was the first Jubilee day and when will be the last Jubilee it's strange I never thought about the 70th I was always worried about 1977 and I think the devil put a screen over the 70th Jubilee and he puffed up 1977 so that everybody could look at 1977 and not look at the 7year Jubilee and God told me you don't look at that come back to the 70th Jubilee and the 70th Jubilee will open up 1977 and we open it up last night now you have to have a special gift to be able to see things like this otherwise you don't see and Peter came to him and said Lord how of shall my brother son against me and forgive him till seven times he thought seven times Jesus said unto him I say not unto thee until seven times until 70 times 7 now we read that we know that but where is Jesus showing us how much is 70 * 7 490 years so Jesus don't answer him there he answers him in the Jubilee why did he answer him in the Jubilee because in the Jubilee is the end of sin he's going to make the end of sin and the end of sin is forgiveness so forgiveness goes back to the Jubilee right into that 400 90 so he tells his disciple you forgive the guy 490 times then you will be in the Jubilee that's how I forgive them because in the Jubilee the priest is in the holy of holies and there he forgives the whole of Jerusalem right in that 4009 oh my God come on [Music] [Applause] Church [Music] [Music]
