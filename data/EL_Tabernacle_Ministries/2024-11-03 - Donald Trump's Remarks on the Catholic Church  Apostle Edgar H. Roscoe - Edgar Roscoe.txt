TRANSCRIPT
========================================
okay well we greet you again and again again in The Only Name That's blessed only name that's glorified only name that bears life Jesus king God we um a GL GL again happy to make this recording and um so that you Al bacle people may know the hour and the time and what's going on as I told uh the family about what I see last night on TV about Visionaries people that can look in the future and decipher what is coming what is going to happen and we know that's Bible the Bible says without Vision the people perish so um that's why we feel that we want to do this clip before the elections on Tuesday of the uh presidency of the United States we U Know That U now that there's two things running here the Roman Catholic church and Camila we just want to focus on Trump and play the clips of trump uh with the Roman Catholic church and his commence about the Roman Catholic church and um never before was it taken into consideration and asking for the Catholics to vote and putting them on a pedestal where Trump has put them under so when we mentioned this in the previous Clips I know it was a shocker because it shocked me when I saw there's two possibilities here with this elections and uh and I saw the Roman Catholic church and uh whether it goes camil camil's way whether it goes Trump's way it just don't look good so um Trump as made the statements and we want to play it to you so that you know even before Tuesday either of them spells chaos to the world so uh I hope you enjoy it I hope your eyes open I hope you see it I hope you go dissect the quote End quotes on the Roman Catholic church we know that such a those scriptures that stand behind that Revelation 17 and Mark of the Beast Revelations 13 America and uh Rome together so I want my people to know exactly what's taking place and I like what somebody else says he says well remember if it don't come to pass there's still another election in front of us the prophet stands and I want to say why because in spite of the the prophecy and the vision it might ter but it says wait for its fulfillment now we've waited 91 years for this prophecy could it be the time and uh uh we saw that the Jubilee 1th Jubilee has finished last week and Friday we seen what happened with the bombing of U um uh the [Music] CH and um and I also would like to say uh Monday that pass was also a good date for us because that was the date when brother Bram laid hands on me in um maranata Park so everything was a cluster everything was together so I pray that uh this will be a blessing for you amen thank you from that time brother Bram says 1960 the 7 month 16th day he says thus saith the Lord in other words God said it not brother brandham God said it there'll be a woman rule a woman rule before the end time listen here before the end time she'll either be president or vice president or the Roman Catholic Church listen there's three important points in this quote Point number one before the end time why does he say before the end time because the seventh vision is the end time the a Bor the seventh trumpet Revelations 11:14 the the Third Woe cometh quickly it comes quickly after her that's the end remember that so her coming in is not the end of the world get me straight please but the bride is gone then when this happens when the bomb Falls when that wo comes remember the bride is gone before the end of the world in other words she won't see the end of the world so brother BR says a woman will rise she'll be he says she'll be president or vice president well she's running for both she already fold the one she is and was the vice president and now she's running to be a candidate for presidency so the quote is running with God's will so far we're going to bring this back again to you her rise was 1990 Deputy district attorney 2000 courtroom prosecutor Francisco 20 uh 2003 district attorney 2010 general attorney 2016 US senator 2020 elected vice president 2024 president candidate isn't the scary straight with the quote anybody can see this could it be El Tabernacle could it be so the quote is running with God's will so far from the same quote from that time he says or the Catholic church so here we see distinctly two woman a natural woman that will be voted in and a spiritual woman which is the Roman Catholic Church that's not voted in she just comes in but the natural woman that will be president she gets voted in so I never saw this just the other day and as I went through the quotes and I think there's about 200 or so many quotes or even more uh and all if you read really those quotes you'll see he speaks every time of two woman that's why we have two candidates for the two woman one is Trump and the other one is Camila one will be Camila that is voted in so far we see how her votes went the other one might be Trump that will let the Roman Catholic Church come in because of the pressure of the Roman Catholic church because America owes her trillions of dollars they can't even pay back the interest so will she put the screws on Trump if he he gets elected and he will give in then to her and afterwards speak as the dragon it's two scenarios here because the Roman Catholic Church when he says the Roman Catholic Church he says I got it in Brackets and you know what that mean I don't have to take it to school so um he says all the Catholic Church two woman then he concludes the quote by saying thus saith the Lord so it must come to pass is this the season for it you might have to check that thing out president Trump we are so honored to have you join us in in front of this very very important faith summit uh you are my friend and I am so blessed to have been a part of your life some people don't know for over 24 years as a part of I feel not only family but you're pastor and an advisor and I got to work in the White House and represent people Faith as senior advisor to Faith initiative and opportunity one of the greatest honors ever we have thousands of pastors here and Faith leaders and their number one issue that they want to know about is what about your faith we're going through a lot of problems in our country if you take a look at the anger the the uh the problems that we have and a lot of it is that it's less based on religion now than it was 25 years ago and 50 years ago and I mean we were a really people would say a Christian and really religious even other Faith's country and that seems to be heading in the wrong direction and I think as that goes goes uh down I think that our country goes down I really do I think this is a country that needs religion it's like the glue that holds it together and we don't we don't have that that's why you are the most important people and I'm not sure you even realize it and they're trying to hurt you they're trying to sty you this new Administration this new uh radical left group of people and it's not so new it's been around for a while and uh there are people that are not nice people if you're if you happen to be Catholic we don't have too many Catholics here maybe but boy they are trying they are persecuting Catholics I actually said how could a Catholic possibly vote for Kamala how could that I know the level of anger and the level of uh vitrio you know when you see uh what's going on with the FBI and the Catholic church I say what is happening and you know the expression is that you're next because they're all everybody's next next with this group and they have a very bad agenda and we have to stop it and we have to win this election I think winning this election I think it's going to be the most important election in the history of our country absolutely thank you everybody well thank you very much it's an honor and we are doing well by the way the votes are starting to come in you got to get out and vote and Catholics you got to vote for me just remember you better remember I'm here and she's not I could have done that too but you do something that's incredible the Catholic Church you're helping the poor educating children and supporting the vulnerable all polls are indicating I'm leading big with a Catholic vote as I should be as I should be I want to thank the Al Smith foundation for its Noble work and I want to express my tremendous gratitude to the Catholic Community it's a great Community it's a community I've gotten along with all my life I tell you when I was when I was President I was in the Oval Office and I got a call from the Cardinal and he said we need help it was during the China virus I want to be accurate when I describe it and he said we need help our schools are in devastating shape they needed much more than a billion I won't even tell you the number but much more than a billion dollars but I've known the community and I've known the the schools I knew I know so many people that were educated in the Catholic school system and they are great and they just speak with it like with love much more so than almost any system that I've seen and he said sir we have uh a big problem we need a number of billions of dollars or we're going to have to close down the New York school system the whole system in New York and I said give me 15 minutes I think I can find it and we gave him billions of dollars and you know what he stayed open and they thrive and to this day I hear you did just about the best job there is in education so and that was always an honor that was always and every time he sees me he says thank you very much I said I know what you're talking about but we work together we were a good partnership right we got that money in about 15 minutes billions and uh it was put to very good use but I just want to thank everybody this is a special evening Less Than 3 weeks to go till election day here in the United States and the race for president appears to be tightening there's a new National Catholic Reporter poll showing Trump up among Catholics in five of the seven swing States tonight the former president and current GOP candidate talks with me again about the issues important to people of Faith about life and those multiple assassination attempts we met at the 79th annual Al Smith dinner for the arch dasis of New York a dinner his opponent vice president kamla Harris has declined to attend here's my exclusive interview with President Donald J Trump Mr President I'm delighted first of all that you made the Downtown Abbey auditions we I think we're going to fit in nicely we're at the alith dinner of course tell me why did you decide it was important to be here and what message is kamla Harris sending by not being here to Catholic voters well I think you're honoring the Catholic church and you know I've been uh long time supporter and I'm surprised she's not here I think she's the first one in many many in decades actually to miss it as a candidate it was always been a tradition so I'm happy only that the Catholics are going to vote for Trump now but uh no it's look I have a special relationship with the Catholic church and I uh I think it was very important to be here yeah uh I've been noticing on your social media posts on your at your rallies you're playing the a Maria you're posting happy birthday Mary a St Michael prayer to ward off evil is that telling voters something about your spiritual journey what is that no I don't think it's just beautiful to me I mean I I look at the whole thing the words and the pictures the pictures are so beautiful and uh yeah I put up some stuff somebody else asked me that same question and it's really that I think it's really very beautiful okay in 2020 you told me I am a pro-life candidate in the interim you got rid of roie Wade and you've said I've returned it to the states and people have to follow their heart some of your supporters is saying well Trump is pro-choice now what would you say to them no no uh I am like Ronald Reagan before me the exceptions are very important to me and that's the life of the mother rape and incest and uh not at all I'm very proud of what we did everybody wanted it to be back in the States where it belongs and the states are voting and frankly some of the votes are very liberal by comparison to what people may have thought but it's now back in the States it's an issue that's torn the country apart for 52 years and now uh and everybody wanted it Democrats Republicans conservatives uh liberals everybody and all legal Scholars wanted it back in the States and now we did that and I have to tell you I give great credit to brilliant Supreme Court Justices we had six brilliant Supreme Court Justices and uh they had great courage and I think the country will now come together will you rein at the Mexico City policy which forbids International spending on abortion well I was the only one that did that as you know no other president did that and we're going to be giving that a very good serious look in other words how that compares and competes with the states but we'll be giving that a very serious look the other day you said I'm the father of IVF as you know some Catholics feel and the Catholic Church believes when you implement this technology you're killing embryos will you have a religious exemption to your IV F mandate for religious organizations and businesses that feel this violates my religious principle well you know I haven't been asked that but it sounds to me like a pretty good idea frankly but uh even Catholics a lot of them they want IVF it's fertilization basically and uh you know they view that as helping a family helping uh parents have a child and it's a very popular thing but certainly if there's a religious uh problem I think people should go with that I should be I I really think they should be able to do that but we'll look at that have an exemption well I got to look I got to get some new ones in here KLA Harris is changing her tactic against you she said to Brett Bear my colleague the other night you president Trump are targeting Americans uh you're calling them the Enemy Within and you're turning the military on the American people you and I both know that he has talked about turning the American Military on the American people he has talked about going after people who are engaged in peaceful protest he has talked about locking people up because they disagree with him this is a democracy your reaction to that and what did you mean when you said the Enemy Within well it's ridiculous that she says that they turning the military these are the really these are the threat to democracy people like actually like her with her language you know she's the most liberal senator in the Senate uh not as smart as most of them but she's certainly more liberal and she likes to say that turning the military how ridiculous is it but I will say this uh the enemy from within we do have an enemy from within we have people that uh are I think more danger to our country when you see the radical left programs that they're espousing and uh we have a a true enemy from within they hate when I say that but whether we like it and I think in many ways it's more dangerous from the outside enemies that we have I want to talk about immigration for a moment the church teaches welcome The Immigrant it also teaches that a nation has a right to protect it borders for the common good how do you president Trump balance welcoming The Immigrant with locking down the border and the deportation promise You' made well as you know we had the strongest borders we've ever had just four years ago we had the most powerful the strongest we let people in but they have to come illegally and I don't think that's changed we want people to come into our country but they have to come illegally uh as you know they allowed people to come in from prisons and frankly murderers the 13,099 murderers where they were let out of prison and convicted murderers and some killed more than one person some killed more than five people and they're now free in our country and we're going to have to get them out and we're going to get them out fast nobody wants that no I want to have people come into our country legally but we have to have strong borders and good elections did you see this lip reader when Joe Biden and Barack Obama were on the side of Ethel Kennedy's funeral this lipr reader who's a forensic expert claims Joe Biden said she's not as strong as I I am was it a mistake to trade KLA Harris for Joe Biden in your opinion well we seem to be winning and we were way up in Joe we had the debate and the numbers were very strong and I just see numbers that are very similar right now they're very similar so we'll see what happens I hope we win because we want to make America great again yeah and and your record of religious liberty how important is that to you religious liberty uh it's a stance that I've taken from the beginning and I'll keep it I wouldn't change it for anything okay final question the pope was asked about your candidacy and kamla Harris and he instructed Catholic voters to vote for the lesser of two evils who do you think he means and why well I think he wants them to vote for me and I stand for really everything that you stand for and that the church stands for and she doesn't she's a a very different kind of a person she's a Marxist her father was a Marxist and still is a Marxist and they are not big into religion I will tell you and I'm not just talking about the Catholic religion I'm talking about any religion uh the whole Democrat Party has gone really radical left and I'm the opposite I am totally in favor of religion and I also like the Catholic Church a lot and I also like the Catholic Church a lot and I also like the Catholic Church a lot thank you Mr President what a pleasure we'll see you soon thank you [Music]
