[0:00] God sent me to you and to tell you

[0:16] yet tender
[0:19] when this happened these Branch yet
[0:21] tender it's not summer yet but summer is
[0:24] coming
[0:27] this happened in 1946 when he was tender
[0:31] and he put forth his leaves
[0:34] but he don't have fruit yet

[0:56] which is Jubilee Davis
[1:00] the angel which is the divine
[1:04] told him to get married on that dates
[1:10] so how could he be wrong when an angel
[1:13] gave him that date and he changed into a
[1:17] young man and his wife was young
[1:20] standing in front of him the dead in
[1:23] Christ
[1:24] so how can he not have known oh my
[1:28] [Applause]
[1:30] divine inspiration
[1:33] he says there'll be signs in the heavens
[1:36] the Stars which is actually those two
[1:40] planets welcome together
[1:45] 23 is God's private number
[1:50] that's why he lets the Jubilee comes on
[1:55] its private number
[1:57] 23rd of October
[1:59] [Music]
[2:01] that's why I stand at the creation on
[2:04] the 23rd of October private number
[2:10] and nobody knew that number only the
[2:15] Jewish priests
[2:16] [Music]
[2:20] and he gave brother Branham his private
[2:23] number
[2:26] to get married
[2:27] 23rd and the last thing he tells us as
