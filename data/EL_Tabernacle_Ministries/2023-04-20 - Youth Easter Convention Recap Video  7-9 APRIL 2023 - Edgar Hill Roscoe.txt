is Worthy is Worthy is Worthy is [Music] Hallelujah [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] He's Worthy there's no one else like him [Music] Lord and Savior Jesus Christ I'm a bit nervous it's actually my first time standing here [Applause] I'd like to share some few testimonies that took place at the University to where I'm studying uh what God has done for us is the young people that side so um it all started in 2019 so 2019 the first brother that came there was uh brother Teng from Springs and uh that's the priority that testified to me as well and then when he came there he said to me my brother I won't stop testifying until the whole future becomes the UL Tabernacle um those words actually came in straight into my heart and that's what I told myself as well is that I won't stop testifying until the whole Beauty becomes the new El Tabernacle [Applause] uh so the first test we actually have a lot of testimonies but uh because of time I'll just say a few that are close to my heart or the ones that threatened me in my faith in L7 naked uh so last year so we were actually at the at the rest is normal so it happened that one of the students there they She fainted and When She fainted now they try to wake her up and then to pour water on here but nothing happened she wasn't waking up and then the rest manager actually he knows what we are Christian so he said no they have to call those guys they have to call those young men's to come and help us and then they call they called us and then we looked at her and then yeah she was not moving nothing and then we went to the study here and we told them that okay everyone must come out and it was only us and the brothers and the and that girl and then we took um we we played an instrument a mystery and then when you play that instrument um we started uh we started praying and then we prayed and prayed and prayed and then I heard they're screaming once and then she woke up and then when we put out actually when we got out to find out that the rest manager was standing at the door his wife was also there all the students were there they even called the ambulance to come and take that girl but when we came out with her she was fine completely fine [Applause] and then yeah it was it was a big scene my brothers and sisters because even those people of the ambulance they didn't know what happened they just too careful test but we went the following day she told us that she was perfectly fine [Applause] um and then the next testimony I would like to share is actually the one whereby um I realized something about this man that we have here the apostol uh is not an ordinary man brothers and sisters now it's not an ordinary man this man doesn't just preach the weight he unknowns the weight I believe everywhere that comes out of the Apostles mouth those words they are anointed I remember this other time I was actually testifying to one see stuff from the University of Pretoria usually here if she's baptized now uh I was just I was testifying to her and I remember this one time I said you know what my sister next time will speak I will be telling you about the Holy Ghost what is the Holy Ghost how do you receive the Holy Ghost and how do you know that you have the Holy Ghost and then I didn't know what where to start I didn't know what to say so I decided to watch the one of the Apostles tape is called how do you know you have the Holy Ghost I actually listened to that tape and I was like saying to myself I'll just get some something then I'll write some few notes and then I found myself writing almost the whole thing and then when I was done I think I had two or three pages and then I called there I said okay now I'm ready my sister and then I started reading what the apostle was saying as I was reading she was aiming but when I was left with a half a page she was crying and I asked myself ah maybe she doesn't like what I'm saying but I continued reading and the time I was almost done she started crying my presence because she cried and now I didn't know what to say anymore because I kept on saying amen my sister amen you know what the Apostle says after the surface that's what I said I didn't know what else to say and then I hanged up the call and then after that I was thinking what just happened and then the thought just hit me and say remember you were fellowshipping about the Holy Ghost and then says if you can speak about the Holy Ghost and nothing happened then you will lie [Applause] and then I realized that actually what I said about the Holy Ghost it is what the apostle was preaching and then the same thing that happened on that tape happened when that Fellowship when I was fellowshipping to her and then as I continued fellowshipping with that girl there was this other day I posted a picture of the Apostle on my status and then I wrote The caption I said The only voice I know and then she replied and said what do you mean I called there and said that's what I mean it's the only voice I know she said to me are you saying that this man is God I said yeah I believe that this man is God [Applause] and then she said to me she said no no no wait wait from the church I am from they are telling me that that man is God so she was from zcc she was saying that man is God I said yeah there are many gods but we don't just want any other court but we want the core of the Bible [Applause] I said um you want the god of Abraham the god of Jacob the god of Isaac that's the god that we are looking for we are not just looking for any other God but we are looking for that God and then I could you took the Bible I said you know what let us put these two Gods on the test you say this man is God I said yeah he's God I'm saying this one is God but let's check which one is the god of the Bible and then I Fellowship to her I told her about Genesis 18 as it was in the days of Lords I told her about the desire of the court of this Bible I told them everything that I know about this God and then after some okay and then it was fine after some few months I think she was in the message there was this other day she was on a call with another sister from nelspruit he says the sister spoke and then she had three voices at the same time she said she was scared now she hanged up the call she called again she had three voices okay she said my sister do you have flu then no I don't have flu but he said hey what's happening now she hanged up the call and then she was sitting on his on her chair and then she says that as she was sitting she saw she saw the Apostle Pastor Jonathan and Pastor Julie's [Applause] and then that's where I found out that I that's why I found out I'm sure even now she knows that there are many chords but we have found the core of the pirate bless your Saints I reach all in the wonderful name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ there's actually a lot of things to say about this ministry uh not knowing where to start because the Lord has done so much for us uh just start by sharing a few testimonies because I'm actually in the University of Johannesburg but I'm working together with the brothers from Val and the president Justified to me is the brother that just spoke we actually come from a place near the border of Mozambique and also Swaziland the reason why we call it nelspade is because I believe that it's a place that many of you are familiar with and um but the name of the place is actually Gomez so by the grace of God in 2019 the brother testified to me I was still doing metric at the time and I remember he went to University at the time and what really took me up by this ministry is that I have known this brother all my life and all of a sudden there was just something different about him I've known him all my life I knew that this Prada we used to do worldly things together but all of a sudden I remember it was during October he told me my brother I found a church and I thought to myself okay you found the church and said to me no but we'll talk when I get there I said no it's fine he came December I remember he started testifying to me and the first time I saw him he was there was just something different about him there was just something about him that I couldn't understand and even the way he spoke the things he was telling me it was things I've never heard before I've been reading the Bible but it was different so now I thought to myself okay this is new and at first I was a bit resistant but the more I spend time with him the more I started to change as well the more I spend time with him the more I something happened to me so by the grace of God I remember the first day he played to me was the mind of Christ and when the apostle was preaching the mind of Christ I remember there's this part where the Apostle says now lay hands on one another and the brother laid his hand on my head I laid my hand on his head I never told him this but it happened after we were done praying he removed his hand and there was just like the palm of his hand there was fire on my head and I said this is God I realized that this is God and since the time I came in it was 2020 it was locked down so we couldn't come to church for two years I couldn't come to church but I was testifying it was just a fire in my soul the things that I heard it was just too much for me and I remember at the church that I was at I remember almost everyone that I got in contact with I told them about the things that I heard I remember at the time it was tips such as uh modern events made clear by prophecy I gave away my wedding comment it was such tips that I told them about that a woman is not allowed to preach it was the basic things things that were supposed to know but for me I remember when I took it I thought that everyone else is going to take it because he this was the truth and I had the mindset that the truth shall set you free I thought that these people were not free so let me go and tell them so that they can be free and by the grace of God uh the whole December so now another story the whole December I remember we were speaking about the apostle and I remember I didn't know him at the time I didn't I it was my first time hearing about this man but there was just something different about him I remember we came to one point we were fellowshipping with the brother the whole December through fellowshipping about revelation 22 16 and he said that no the Apostle is the Angel that's what we had that's the first revelation that we had because the Apostle says you grow in Revelation so we were growing in Revelation you're getting closer and closer and closer so what happened was what happened was um what really shook us is that every time it Fellowship a brother would come in a fellowship the exact same things that he was speaking about so that really shook us but the most remarkable thing is that the whole December through we're speaking about the Apostle being the angel and if you remember Saints the 31st of December 2019 the title of the Apostles message was I sent my angel before you [Applause] so after that I I remember I was supposed to go to university and things didn't work out I believe that God wanted me to stay at home because there were other things that came in during the time testifying and mind you come from a place where at the time there was no deacons no Elders nothing it was only us young people but the tapes kept us alive and I I remember the the statement which Paul made he said I'm uh absent in the flesh but present in the spirit so I think that God was there because he as I said we have a lot of testimonies but because of time we can't share all of them so just going back a bit to what happened this year not very long ago it was last week and last of last week at rest there's a sister from the same rest that I stay at I testified to her last year by the grace of God she got baptized and she's also testifying as well we're winning souls for the Lord so what happened was uh last week we were because sometimes we come together and we have Fellowship so the sister came and there was another soul that she came with and there was another sister which is a message believer she's not in church but she's a message believer so I remember her telling me that I met this other sister but she's a message believer and she said to her that she asked her do you know about El Tabernacle do you know about the Apostle she said she doesn't know anything about that I said it's fine my sister we'll talk about it when we get to the fellowship so we go to the fellowship I remember um as we started fellowshipping and the only thing I could tell her was the quotes of Prada pranam where he speaks about 1946 was the cold weather speaks about that angel he says those seven angels are Earthly Messengers but he says that there's that one angel that will come to announce something he says that there's that one Angel that's gonna come and he's gonna announce something he says that angel is revelation 10. so I was telling the sister about that and as you continued speaking about taking out the quotes and then I started I just drifted I don't know what happened but I just found myself speaking about the jubility how the apostle was raised how he grew up the testimonies he had and all of a sudden uh the sister as I mentioned the sister from rest I won't mention any names but the Holy Ghost fell and she started feeling the Holy Ghost and I could see that the Holy Ghost is falling and not only that since but even the soul that you brought with the soul that she brought with God's slay even the message believer got slain [Applause] and since um even I think last week Wednesday uh before I came to church because I think that Wednesday he was supposed to share this testimony but due to change of plans we had to come today but even that Wednesday before I left I said to the sister my sister can you please all just come together and let's just have a fellowship because I won't be there on Thursday and Friday and she said it's fine my brother we came together and I remember we were fellowshipping the same thing happened the Holy Ghost came down again [Applause] and then now um in closing uh uh as the brother said that um he doesn't believe that the Apostle is an ordinary man and I'd like to say that um I remember when he came in the ministry he used to share his testimonies with me told me you know my brother I had a dream about the apostle but I think that with me and as I mentioned that I only came to church after two years with me I wasn't that much bothered with not dreaming about the Apostle I believe that God comes to all of us in a different way and with me there was just something different there's just this feeling that I get whenever I the the angel of the Lord is there and there's even the sister from nelspruit the brother mentioned about her that sister can attest to that I remember there was this one time I went to where she stays and we had a fellowship I told her my sister connect the angel of the Lord is here and all of a sudden the sister started feeling the angel of the Lord the Holy Ghost was present so the last testimony I remember there was this other sister I was testifying to we used to go to the same school together but I take her as my little sister and this sister I remember we spoke and over the phone he was speaking and I was sharing to her about um uh what I was listening to because we only had tapes and there was some brothers that used to Fellowship to us another product from secunda so I was listening to a tape and I remember at the time if my memory says me correctly I remember it was uh the revelation of Hell and its Dimensions part two and I remember I was sharing to the sister about that um tape and all of a sudden the sister was responding but something happened and as the sister there was a moment where the sister got silent and I but I could also feel that the Holy Ghost came and all of a sudden I just heard the sister Scream the Holy Ghost came into the room she was speaking over the phone so I felt that the Holy Ghost was present and believe you're saying this this was happening even before I got baptized I only got baptized in 2021 February but then it was still 2020 and every time it Fellowship the Holy Ghost would come down [Applause] so now this is the when she screamed and she fell down on the floor and as I said I was worshiping I just put the phone down I started worshiping and all of a sudden as the Holy Ghost began to subside and then the the sister came to me uh she came back on the phone we started speaking again and then she told me brother you won't believe what happened I I said to her my sister what do you mean she said to me uh something just happened she said to me when I screamed uh uh my sibling came into the room and asked me if I'm fine and she said uh to The Sibling no it's fine you can go out and The Sibling left the room close the door she said she felt as if a door was opening again and when she looked the door was closed and she said that the thing is with her door when you open it it makes a noise she said that she felt a presence in a room once you fill that presence in the room she said when she looked up she saw a light and that light changed into a figure and the figure was a man wearing a white suit and she said the man wearing a white suit was the Apostle at the hill roster foreign amen

just hang on a little bit and I go to news and I prayed for that kidney [Applause] and I thought when I heard having kidney stones my mind shot the devil shot me with something I wonder if it's not
