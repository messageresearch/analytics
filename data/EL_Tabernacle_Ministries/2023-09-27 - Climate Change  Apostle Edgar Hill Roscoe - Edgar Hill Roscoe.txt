TRANSCRIPT
========================================
wild weather rages around the world do I think you know the end of the world's coming no I don't uh it's just it's it's just a weird feeling and it's all across our globe extreme weather of seemingly biblical proportions now a painful New Normal well it's been a week of extreme weather conditions and weather related disasters around the UN says this is a code red for Humanity and there is nowhere to hide I do not look for anything more than the signs of the coming of the Lord the biggest thing that must happen is climate change then the coming of the Lord are we watching without seeing what's going on are we not realizing that the climate is changing men will see that things are happening and if their eyes are closed they cannot see that it is transpiring right in front of them [Music] thank you
