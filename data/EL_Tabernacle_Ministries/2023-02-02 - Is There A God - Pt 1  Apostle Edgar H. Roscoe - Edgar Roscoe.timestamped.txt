[0:01] is there a God
[0:04] so I want to later on go into physics
[0:10] and tomorrow I would like to take and go
[0:13] into genetics
[0:17] and our science actually
[0:21] proves God
[0:24] if you really
[0:32] study
[0:34] cans thou by searching
[0:37] find out God
[0:40] can thou find out the almighty unto
[0:45] perfection
[0:48] everything was created
[0:51] and everything had a great thought
[0:53] but who is the creator
[0:58] of the god of the Hebrews
[1:01] and the god of the Muslims and the god
[1:04] of the Christians
[1:06] he has no beginning of days
[1:09] he has no end of life
[1:13] nobody created him
[1:15] [Applause]
[1:18] and that's the God you are serving
[1:21] beginning God God said let there be
[1:24] Lifetime and there was Lifetime and the
[1:28] atoms verse and now we have a universe
[1:31] and we have people lifting up the atoms
[1:35] towards God and saying praise the Lord
[1:38] praise the Lord for I was once a sinner
[1:41] but now I am a saint I was once lost but
[1:46] now I am found I am once a hell-bound to
[1:51] headache but now God cleanse me
[1:54] [Applause]
[1:59] is there a God
[2:02] can't hear you
[2:05] [Applause]
