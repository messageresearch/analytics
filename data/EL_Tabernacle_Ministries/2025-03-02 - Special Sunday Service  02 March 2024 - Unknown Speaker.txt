hands where every we standing h [Music] oh Lord we love you Lord we love you wherever you are in your homes just sing the stream Lord and He uted these words saying this Bullit is The Mercy Seat of e [Music] Tabernacle Lord help me Lord help me Lord help me he says what is the bullpit is to pull you out of the butt and there was an angel in E Tabernacle that pulled me out of the butth Hallelujah I was a good for nothing I was hopeless but there was another Angel another Angel and I say another Angel and I want to say that angel is no other than [Music] Rosco and the another angel came and stood at the altar having a golden sensor and there was given unto him much in sense that he should offer it with the praise of the Saints unto the golden altar which was Before the Throne there's an angel in E Tabernacle that takes our prayers and he mixes it with sweet smelling Savor so that when it comes to the altar it comes to the presence of God he cannot help but turn and he and look where that good smell comes from but it's all because of that angel of this SP and the smoke of the incense which came with the prayers of the Saints ascended up before God out of the Angel's hands and the angel took the scent and filled it with fire of the Altar and casted into the Earth and there were voices and thunderings and Lightnings and earthquake when this Angel comes in to [Music] your needs your desires the whole Earth and Heaven shakes at the same time may God add a blessing to the reading of his word [Music] hallelujah the 28th of [Music] February it was a happy visitation day the 28th of February was when the cloud appeared and in Revelations 10:1 it says I saw another Mighty Angel come down from heaven clothed with a cloud and here is that Mighty Angel clothed with a cloud his clothes is a cloud Hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah blessed be the name of the most high God and this [Music] was 2001 in maranata park where that angel was blowing the [Music] trumpet want to play you one clip [Music] Hallelujah God bless everyone I pray that you have a good day with God today brother brandham says when you want to get closer to God you pray and you read your Bible so where you were last week and this week it's two different levels that you can get so if you want to get more closer to God you're going to have to pray and remember what the Apostle said when you pray pray some part of you goes to the throne and God recognizes your voice and he says I know that voice that's my child speaking to me now and while you speaking he listens because you're part of him and by him recognizing your voice in prayer he will answer your prayer because he knows you are on the earth and you're going through a trial going through a hard time you are in a battle but he knows he's with you in the battle but he wants you to cry to him and when you cry out to him remember the answer is already on the way he says in the Millennium before you ask he will answer and it's already we are right there now that before we even ask God anything he already has worked out the answer because all things Works to together for the good to them that love the Lord so remember your prayer this Tuesday he's already answered but he wants you to ask so do the leadership and yourself of favor ask God today and then see if the answer comes and if the answer comes then you thank him for the rest of the week for answering your prayer cuz he's looking for an an excuse for you to talk to him he's every day looking for an excuse for you to meditate on him he's looking for an excuse to heal from you and you have a way to God's thrown by the representative on the earth so how come God cannot answer your prayer when he already sent somebody so that your prayers can be answered the Apostle praise you pray it's done Satan it's done House of hell it's done you just got to open your mouth buy your subconscious mind pray and God knows your voice God bless [Music] [Music] you spend time in the presence of God uh that man spends time with Jesus Christ that man hears from the Throne of God hallelujah he's under the unction and God wants more young men like that even if they said that you cannot pray he says I cannot pray that's my hour prayer no but the king said you I don't care what the king says I am going to pray Hallelujah young people God wants you to pray God wants you to [Music] [Applause] [Music] pray God bless you I just want to say this before we go into the prayer session just remember this that God's Apostle he moves in two Dimensions at the same [Music] time so I want show you that this holy ghost that is in this place can move in your homes wherever you are this morning you will feel the you will hear the footsteps of that angel because he can be here and there at the same time as we bow our heads and close our eyes [Music] great Eternal Heavenly Father Lord we come with bowed heads and bowed Hearts to your throne of grace your
