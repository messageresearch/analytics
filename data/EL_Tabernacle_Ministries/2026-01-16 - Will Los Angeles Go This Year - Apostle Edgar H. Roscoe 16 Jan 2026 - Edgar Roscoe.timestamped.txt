[0:10] He's coming back.
[0:12] &gt;&gt; On a silver cloud of glory.
[0:15] &gt;&gt; He's going to take me away. Take me
[0:19] right away.
[0:20] &gt;&gt; I'm looking now at the sign of his
[0:23] returning.
[0:25] Won't be long. It may just be today.
[0:30] Jesus has gone to prepare for me a
[0:33] mansion way up on Glory Avenue.
[0:40] I'm standing firm on the promise that he
[0:43] made. Where I am, you can be there, too.
[0:49] He's coming back on a silver glory.
[0:54] He's going to take me away right away.
[0:59] &gt;&gt; I'm looking now at the sign of his
[1:02] returning. Won't be long. He may just be
[1:06] there.
[1:27] How many times have I dreamed of
[1:30] disappearing
[1:32] when he will take his bride away?
[1:37] I'm making plans to attend that marriage
[1:40] supper on that great eternal wedding
[1:44] day.
[1:47] He's coming back. Coming back.
[1:51] He's going to take me away.
[1:56] I'm looking back.
[2:01] Won't be long.
[2:06] He's coming back.
[2:10] He's going to take me away.
[2:15] I
[2:17] sound return
[2:22] today.
[2:43] He's coming back soon.
[2:48] He's going to take me away.
[2:53] I'm looking now.
[2:57] Won't be long
[2:59] today.
[3:01] Well, he's coming back soon.
[3:07] He's going to take me away.
[3:11] I'm looking at the sign of his return.
[3:16] Won't be long.
[3:21] I greet you again and again and again
[3:27] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ,
[3:30] our savior,
[3:33] our king,
[3:35] and our god.
[3:39] I um really didn't think I'll be
[3:44] on stream and uh
[3:47] busy again
[3:50] uh so soon this year.
[3:54] But uh things happens
[3:57] and then you just have to fall in.
[4:01] And this is one of those things that
[4:05] just happened.
[4:07] And uh
[4:10] it caused a question
[4:13] and what I said on New Year's Eve,
[4:17] a message,
[4:19] I never had it on my notes.
[4:22] I never thought about it.
[4:25] I never
[4:28] felt inspired
[4:30] to go
[4:32] this way. But I just found myself
[4:37] saying,
[4:39] I pray that Los Angeles should go down
[4:43] this year,
[4:44] 2026.
[4:49] And that made some ears pop up in the
[4:53] church.
[4:56] So some brothers ask about it.
[5:00] And now I'm telling you what happened
[5:02] there. It just
[5:04] it just came up
[5:07] while I was speaking and or preaching
[5:11] and then even brother Gus picked it up
[5:13] and uh we had uh a lengthy confident
[5:18] conversation on it and we were shocked
[5:21] what came out of it
[5:23] because he on the other side went back
[5:27] check up a few things
[5:29] and some of the things I'm going to
[5:31] mention Yeah.
[5:33] And it um
[5:36] really blew our minds.
[5:39] Um
[5:41] and that's the reason I thought I'll
[5:42] just come and speak to the church. And I
[5:45] want to make it pretty clear
[5:48] this is for my church.
[5:51] So um
[5:54] I am responsible
[5:57] not for the outside world
[6:00] but outside of my church
[6:02] I'm responsible
[6:05] for my church. So if something happens I
[6:08] need to tell them because Paul says I
[6:11] didn't shun to declare all
[6:14] and that is actually what I want to do.
[6:16] whatever is in my heart and whatever
[6:18] comes up
[6:21] I need to let
[6:24] uh the church know about it. I think
[6:27] that is scriptural
[6:30] and it's also
[6:32] ethic
[6:34] and um
[6:36] I know that uh this heading that we put
[6:40] up
[6:42] is quite shocking.
[6:44] Could Los Angeles go down this year?
[6:48] Uh now I know that um
[6:53] uh it causes ripples
[6:56] uh a title or a heading like this
[7:00] and uh I know there's many ministers
[7:02] that would never do a thing like this.
[7:05] And um
[7:08] I
[7:10] I'm not different. I'm just a human
[7:12] being.
[7:14] So, um, if you really check the heading,
[7:20] and I want you to please note what I'm
[7:24] saying.
[7:26] could.
[7:28] Not God said could
[7:33] or I said on the tape
[7:36] or I pray
[7:39] that Los Angeles should go down this
[7:43] year.
[7:45] I don't think that is rational
[7:49] for anybody to even
[7:53] say a thing like that.
[7:56] But uh I think Paul felt the same way
[8:00] the rapture will take place and he will
[8:02] change and brother Brandham also and
[8:05] that's why brother Brandham says and
[8:07] says this is the time there is nothing
[8:10] wrong in probing
[8:12] checking up things God wants us to check
[8:16] up things search he says and that's what
[8:21] we are doing
[8:23] and I'd like to saying you look at a
[8:25] message you preach on coming storms of
[8:28] judgment it's not that judgment is here
[8:31] I can see it comes on
[8:35] at the same time he preach on flashing
[8:38] red light of his coming not that he has
[8:41] come this is what's going to happen
[8:43] before he comes
[8:46] and u you find the guys every day have
[8:51] weather predictions
[8:53] It's not that the weather is like that
[8:55] when they start the predictions. They
[8:59] said tomorrow it will be rainy. So rain
[9:01] is coming tomorrow. So it's a
[9:04] prediction. It's a feeling. It's
[9:07] something that's coming.
[9:10] And uh brother Banab speaks about
[9:13] when a boat goes down or when a
[9:17] earthquake comes that animals all runs
[9:20] and stands once in a group they know.
[9:24] And brother B says now if animals knows
[9:27] oncoming storms of judgment how much
[9:30] more us.
[9:32] So now that on that premises I
[9:37] I want to speak to you that I feel
[9:41] like those animals like the predictions
[9:44] that this thing is coming
[9:47] and um
[9:49] I um
[9:52] would like to go into it and you can
[9:55] make up your mind how you feel about it.
[10:00] But uh this is the way I feel
[10:04] and that's why I said uh I know it's not
[10:06] a rational thing.
[10:08] Uh it is really controversial
[10:12] in a sense.
[10:14] Now I would like to say point number one
[10:18] we know she has to go down.
[10:23] It's been prophesied
[10:27] been prophesied by Nradamus,
[10:30] Ed Galaci,
[10:33] William Mariam Brandon.
[10:36] The scientist says even up till today
[10:41] she can go down in 5 minutes
[10:44] or in 5 years.
[10:47] So
[10:48] it has already been predicted and it's
[10:51] already said she's going down and the
[10:55] Bible also said she's going down in
[10:57] Revelation 16:18.
[11:00] So the fact of those angels was going
[11:03] down
[11:06] is inevitable.
[11:09] Everybody knows she's going down.
[11:11] There's been films made also
[11:15] that she's going down.
[11:18] So are we in that
[11:21] environment or in that space now
[11:26] that it is logical
[11:30] for her to go down?
[11:33] I like to talk about that environment
[11:38] to you El Tabernacle.
[11:40] have we come into that sphere
[11:45] that you could go down.
[11:50] Um so it's prophesied already.
[11:55] Now it's only time and season.
[11:58] The prophecy is done already.
[12:01] It's only is it time or is it season?
[12:05] Now
[12:08] we need to
[12:10] realize that
[12:12] it is already determined. Time is
[12:14] already there. The scientist says in 5
[12:17] minutes was any time or within 5 years.
[12:23] It's anybody's guess.
[12:27] The season is the problem
[12:30] that's left to anybody's
[12:33] speculations.
[12:35] Is this the season? We know the time is
[12:39] ripe for it to go
[12:43] like Paul, everybody was shaken because
[12:45] it it didn't happen.
[12:49] But it only didn't happen because it's
[12:51] not season. It's the right time.
[12:55] She's cracked up already.
[12:58] Even the scientist says they don't know
[13:00] what is keeping her up.
[13:03] So the time I haven't got any problems
[13:06] but did we enter the season
[13:10] for her to go down? We know how perfect
[13:12] God is even with brother Brennan. You
[13:16] know, if a head is out of place, it
[13:18] could be time.
[13:21] But if it's not season
[13:24] for that thing to be that had to be on
[13:27] the right place and that human's got to
[13:30] sit in the right chair, nothing will
[13:32] happen.
[13:34] So we have everything
[13:40] just
[13:42] have we
[13:44] work out is this the
[13:50] real season
[13:54] for her to go.
[13:56] So um
[13:59] uh so my speculations and feeling and
[14:03] pray
[14:05] and dream
[14:07] is
[14:09] could you go 2026?
[14:15] I hope I'm wrong.
[14:18] I hope I'm wrong. I hope my feeling is
[14:22] wrong. I hope my season is wrong.
[14:28] But if it isn't,
[14:32] then we are in great great problems.
[14:36] Is because
[14:38] is there enough desperation
[14:41] like Daniel when he saw there was two
[14:44] years left, he went straight into
[14:47] desperation.
[14:51] And the same thing
[14:53] should occur to us.
[14:55] And therefore when I spoke on that, you
[14:59] can go listen to the tape.
[15:02] I also said um
[15:05] the handwriting is on the wall for it to
[15:07] go.
[15:09] I mentioned it on there.
[15:12] And I said, if you don't feel that way,
[15:14] there's something wrong with you
[15:17] because
[15:20] you still want to
[15:22] mess around
[15:26] in this vomit
[15:31] of
[15:33] this life.
[15:35] Brother already preached the world is
[15:37] falling apart anyhow.
[15:40] So all those things comes up and builds
[15:44] up the season.
[15:46] You see they asked Jesus what will the
[15:49] end be and then he gave them steps
[15:55] before it's going to happen.
[15:58] Matthew 25,
[16:00] before the door shut, there's steps.
[16:04] Certain things needs to be fulfilled
[16:06] step by step before the door could close
[16:10] up.
[16:12] So that's what we want to get to.
[16:15] So let's go straight into 1956.
[16:21] The handwriting on the wall preach
[16:25] by the prophet William Marian Brham.
[16:28] Now listen,
[16:33] it's 56 when he preached
[16:36] and this is what he says.
[16:39] And 2 years ago
[16:43] in California, he says, "Two years ago,
[16:47] he made this statement." Now, if you
[16:50] remember, I preached the 70th Jubilee.
[16:55] And I said, "There's two years to it
[17:01] right here."
[17:04] And we didn't realize how quick that two
[17:06] years has went.
[17:10] And the chronologist says it won't go
[17:13] past 2026
[17:17] from the time we preach this. We said
[17:20] two years. Watch the two years.
[17:23] Daniel, two years left. Now two years.
[17:28] And brother Brandham comes with
[17:29] handwriting on the wall and it says two
[17:32] years ago
[17:36] in California which is Los Angeles
[17:40] when we was at the cow
[17:44] palace
[17:46] where
[17:48] the in California in a meeting. Why? I
[17:53] happen to think that Pentecost is 50
[17:57] years old. 1956,
[17:59] it's been 15 years old this year. Now,
[18:02] he done calculations
[18:05] and there was a reason he done it.
[18:08] Now, watch what he says.
[18:12] This year in America. This year in
[18:15] America. Look. Revelations 13.
[18:19] And writing on the wall. America 1956.
[18:26] This is what he says. This is 50 year
[18:30] Pentecost. 50
[18:32] years ago. The Holy Spirit fell the
[18:36] first time ever since Pentecost.
[18:41] 1956
[18:43] for the first time
[18:46] 50 years ago the Holy Spirit fell first
[18:49] at Yuzuza
[18:51] which is Los Angeles.
[18:54] So Los Angeles is hooked in with
[19:01] the Holy Ghost the oil.
[19:09] The Holy Spirit fell first at Yuza
[19:11] Street and the old Yuza Street mission
[19:14] in California.
[19:16] So here's points here
[19:19] and I want to draw your whole attention
[19:21] to this quote. Two years ago,
[19:28] we spoke about it here
[19:34] 2026
[19:36] and he preaches
[19:38] the handwriting is on the wall.
[19:43] That means what is on the wall
[19:47] is Pentecost and the Holy Spirit in
[19:50] California
[19:54] if
[19:57] you are spiritual.
[20:01] So the first time the Holy Ghost fell at
[20:04] Pentecost
[20:06] started 1906.
[20:10] There was the first time it fell.
[20:14] But it was in Los Angeles. The Holy
[20:17] Ghost fell
[20:19] and it's Los Angeles
[20:21] that gets the earthquake.
[20:27] A black brother started it. The Holy
[20:31] Ghost to fall in Los Angeles.
[20:34] And right now in 2026,
[20:39] we have a colored guy.
[20:42] Every second word out of his mouth
[20:46] is
[20:48] the greater works, the Holy Ghost,
[20:52] receive and give.
[20:54] Nobody ever
[20:57] underline it as he did.
[21:01] Psalm
[21:07] We have
[21:09] Trump says
[21:12] nobody can make war against the USA.
[21:17] I want to get into something. But the
[21:19] United States proved once again that we
[21:22] have the most powerful, most lethal,
[21:23] most sophisticated, and most
[21:26] fearsome. It's a fearsome military on
[21:30] planet Earth. And it's not even close.
[21:31] And I've been saying it for a long time.
[21:33] Nobody can take us. Nobody. We don't
[21:34] want to have it. We don't have a
[21:36] discussion. But you read all and you see
[21:39] everything else. Nobody could have done
[21:40] that. Nobody has our weapons. Nobody has
[21:43] the quality of our weapons. The problem
[21:44] is we don't produce them fast enough.
[21:46] We're going to start producing them much
[21:47] faster. We're going to be very tough on
[21:49] the companies. We have the best weapons
[21:51] in the world, but it takes too long to
[21:52] get them, including allies. When allies
[21:55] want to buy them, they have to wait four
[21:56] years for a plane, 5 years for a
[21:58] helicopter. We're not letting that
[22:00] happen anymore. We're telling our
[22:01] defense contractors, you're going to
[22:03] start building faster.
[22:05] Pharaoh says, "No army will dare to make
[22:08] war against Egypt."
[22:13] Babylon felt the same.
[22:16] Rome felt the same.
[22:19] On the battlefield,
[22:22] no nation can touch them.
[22:26] Trump says that inequivocally
[22:32] no nation will dare to come against us.
[22:35] We're too powerful.
[22:38] So I notice the minute
[22:41] they say a thing like that,
[22:47] then God steps in
[22:50] and he destroys
[22:53] that nation
[22:56] with natural
[22:58] disasters,
[23:02] plagues.
[23:04] They can't fight it with swords and
[23:06] shield. America,
[23:09] Los Angeles,
[23:12] they can't keep up with all the
[23:15] technology.
[23:17] Yellowstone will erupt
[23:20] and they can't stop
[23:23] the blast.
[23:26] Will that bring her on her knees? Now,
[23:29] why do you go to America? Because it
[23:32] first fell in America.
[23:34] Revelations 13.
[23:38] All this
[23:40] builds up that atmosphere
[23:44] that God
[23:47] wants to
[23:49] destroy you.
[23:53] Now
[23:55] I want to say again,
[23:58] will Los Angeles be down
[24:04] at the bottom of the ocean and
[24:07] Yellowstone erupts
[24:10] and the atomic bomb
[24:13] finishes up
[24:16] this year.
[24:18] So
[24:20] now the Mets
[24:23] is scary on that quote as brother
[24:26] Brandham does the calculation 50 years
[24:29] he calculated.
[24:31] Now, if we do the maths on that thing,
[24:34] the first time the Holy Ghost fell was
[24:37] 1906,
[24:41] which was when Pentecost
[24:44] broke out in America, 1906.
[24:49] We're in the year 2026. This is this
[24:52] year. Now, watch. Let's do the maths.
[24:58] 1906
[25:00] and 2026
[25:03] will give you 120 years.
[25:09] Now thing starts happening.
[25:14] 120 years.
[25:16] The message preached 1956 handwriting on
[25:20] a wall.
[25:24] If you minus it by 50, you come out to
[25:28] 1906
[25:30] Yiza Street.
[25:33] Now from 1906 to 2026
[25:39] 120 years
[25:44] scary calculations
[25:49] that the Holy Ghost is now here
[25:53] for 120 years.
[25:57] And here comes a guy after
[26:00] 120 years and he says the oil is gone.
[26:04] And now after the oil is gone, the door
[26:07] is shut. So he brings in Noah
[26:13] because Noah preached 120 years and the
[26:17] door was shut.
[26:19] Are we in that environment
[26:25] for Los Angeles to go
[26:30] 120 years this year? Says the Holy Ghost
[26:33] fell. Luke 17:28.
[26:36] As it was in the days of Noah, so will
[26:39] it be when he comes,
[26:43] the doors get shut.
[26:47] I didn't know why I preached that. I
[26:50] didn't know it's going to fall in like
[26:51] this. I didn't know the 120 years is up
[27:01] and here it caught us with our pins
[27:04] down.
[27:07] And that made me so scary that I could
[27:09] jump in and come and tell you.
[27:13] You've been in these series of meetings.
[27:15] Go check this book up and all the dates
[27:18] here to 2026.
[27:22] And here we back here
[27:25] in 2026
[27:27] referring us back.
[27:30] There is now 120 years.
[27:34] So 2026 the Holy Ghost is here. Then the
[27:38] Holy Ghost oil is taken away
[27:41] like in Genesis 6. My spirit will not
[27:43] strive.
[27:45] And immediately after that
[27:48] 120 years is given and God destroys the
[27:53] earth
[27:55] after he preach
[27:57] 120 years is the door shut my brothers
[28:02] and the Holy Ghost is taken away
[28:05] this year 2026
[28:08] he takes his spirit in Genesis 6 and
[28:11] lock
[28:13] the war.
[28:16] We said two years ago that there's two
[28:18] years left.
[28:20] Now we found out with the street and the
[28:24] earthquake. So is it possible according
[28:28] to this calculation
[28:30] that this could be the year?
[28:34] I don't know. I hope I'm wrong.
[28:38] I'm only human.
[28:40] I also have feelings.
[28:43] I believe Paul and them had feelings. I
[28:46] have feelings too.
[28:48] All right. Check out is this the season?
[28:51] It's so much look like it with a
[28:54] calculated years. Now at 120th
[28:59] this book at 120th Jubilee the prophet
[29:05] and the chronologist says the rapture
[29:08] must go.
[29:13] And they said it can't go further than
[29:16] 2026.
[29:18] I didn't say so.
[29:21] That's what brother Brandham says in
[29:22] Daniel 70s. That's what the chronologist
[29:26] all of them say.
[29:28] The 120 years is up this year. And the
[29:33] 70th week
[29:35] actually
[29:38] goes
[29:39] right in to Daniel 70 weeks with the
[29:45] 70th jubilee. It all ends this year.
[29:50] So that's the reason I said we have to
[29:52] come into the season. These are the
[29:55] things that makes me think this is the
[29:57] season.
[30:03] So because 120 jubilees from creation
[30:08] the creation was 44
[30:11] to 2026 is
[30:14] 120 jubilees
[30:16] exactly.
[30:22] song
[30:24] is that why it just came in to me to say
[30:28] it without knowing this. We only found
[30:30] out this when we went back and good
[30:32] search.
[30:37] That's why I said it's it's it's my
[30:41] feeling
[30:44] that the season
[30:46] is right for her to go.
[30:49] And 120 jubilees,
[30:52] if you times it 50 by 50,
[30:56] 50 is jubilee. So if you multiply 120 *
[31:02] 50, you get 6,000.
[31:08] And we're now 6,000 years on the earth.
[31:14] And men was made on the 6th,000th
[31:18] year,
[31:21] the sixth day,
[31:24] which is 120 jubilees.
[31:28] So how could it be
[31:31] so perfect?
[31:38] So man is on the earth for 6,000 years.
[31:43] 6,000 years of sinning
[31:46] this year.
[31:49] And God on the sixth day made man.
[31:54] Is God going to make a new man, the
[31:56] statue of a perfect man for the seventh
[31:59] day
[32:01] which is millennium?
[32:03] The meek shall inherit the earth.
[32:07] So anything after this
[32:10] speak about the Sabbath,
[32:13] but it must be
[32:16] Los Angeles
[32:19] to open up. Now we went through all this
[32:23] in Matthew when the earthquake came, the
[32:25] graves open and the dead raised. So we
[32:28] know what this mean.
[32:35] Is the wise version going to be called
[32:38] to enter the door? It's scary times.
[32:44] Maybe they know what I preach.
[32:48] Enter the door with an earthquake.
[32:52] Noah's day the fountains open.
[32:57] In Genesis 7:11,
[33:00] the founders of the deep was open up.
[33:04] What was that? The earth can't just open
[33:06] up. It had to open up with the
[33:08] earthquake for the water to come, the
[33:10] underneath rivers to come up
[33:14] and then also the atomic explosion
[33:20] or waiting for America.
[33:25] So
[33:26] could it be
[33:30] that at the 120th year of the Holy Ghost
[33:35] and at it's funny at the end of the 120
[33:38] years here's a man crying and shouting
[33:41] and preaching about the Holy Ghost
[33:45] the atomic bomb in Noah's day too.
[33:49] So it looks pretty. So
[33:53] Jesus said it, nobody ever speak
[33:57] such a lot
[34:00] about peace
[34:02] like Trump.
[34:04] &gt;&gt; All right, let's go now uh to Mara Lago
[34:06] where President Trump is ringing in the
[34:08] new year tonight with festivities at his
[34:10] Palm Beach uh mansion. It is a
[34:12] star-studded crowd tonight at that
[34:14] event. our own Libby Dean. Uh she is
[34:16] there as well. And just a short while
[34:17] ago, she had a question for the
[34:19] president about his resolution uh for
[34:22] the new year ahead. Take a listen.
[34:24] &gt;&gt; Do you have a New Year's resolution?
[34:26] &gt;&gt; I have peace. Peace on earth. Peace on
[34:31] earth.
[34:32] &gt;&gt; Peace on earth. Before uh the
[34:34] celebrations began and Trump wished uh
[34:36] for world peace, there there was work to
[34:38] be done. It was
[34:39] &gt;&gt; every time he says and talks, he talks
[34:42] about peace.
[34:44] And the Bible says
[34:47] they'll speak about peace, peace,
[34:50] and sudden destruction will heed them.
[34:56] In 2026, America will be 250 years old
[35:01] this year.
[35:03] 1786
[35:05] * 250
[35:08] is 2026.
[35:13] Trump is already planning a big party.
[35:15] &gt;&gt; My campaign for president, I pledged to
[35:17] give America the most spectacular
[35:19] birthday party the world has ever seen
[35:21] for America's 250th anniversary on July
[35:25] 4th next year. Already, we've had big
[35:28] celebrations to commemorate the 250th
[35:31] birthdays of the Army, the Navy, and the
[35:34] United States Marines. But there is
[35:36] much, much more to come. We're going to
[35:38] have a good time. As we ring in 2026,
[35:41] Americans across the nation will see the
[35:43] iconic Washington Monument illuminated
[35:46] with festive birthday lights to honor
[35:48] the start of this historic anniversary
[35:51] year. Then from June 25th to July 10th
[35:54] of next year, we will host the Great
[35:57] American State Fair on the National
[35:59] Mall, featuring pavilions from all 50
[36:02] states, highlighting breathtaking
[36:03] innovations and celebrating America's
[36:06] exceptional history and culture.
[36:08] Frankly, you'll never see anything like
[36:10] it, and you'll never see anything like
[36:12] it again. In the fall, we will host the
[36:14] first ever Patriot Games, an
[36:16] unprecedented 4-day athletic event
[36:19] featuring the greatest high school
[36:20] athletes. one young man and one young
[36:23] woman from each state and territory. But
[36:26] I promise there will be no men playing
[36:29] in women's sports. You're not going to
[36:30] see that. You'll see everything but
[36:31] that. As I first announced in 2020, we
[36:35] will build the National Garden of
[36:36] American Heroes featuring statues of
[36:39] alltime greatest Americans. And we will
[36:42] build a triumphal ark as we celebrate
[36:45] 250 years of American freedom. We are
[36:48] the only major
[36:51] city. We are the only major capital. We
[36:55] are the only major place without a
[36:58] triumphal arc. A beautiful triumphal
[37:01] arc. One like in Paris where they have
[37:04] the uh great a beautiful ark in Paris.
[37:07] They call it the arc the triumph. And
[37:09] we're going to have one in Washington DC
[37:12] very soon. Construction will start in
[37:14] the very near future. And next spring,
[37:16] we will host a major prayer event on the
[37:19] National Mall to rededicate our country
[37:22] as one nation under God. We're not
[37:25] changing that. There are a lot of people
[37:27] would like to see it. It'll never
[37:28] happen. And on Flag Day, we will have a
[37:31] one-of-a-kind UFC event here at the
[37:34] White House. It'll be the greatest
[37:35] champion fighters in the world, all
[37:38] fighting that same night. The great Dana
[37:41] White is hosting and it's going to be
[37:43] something special. But all of this is
[37:45] just the beginning. 2026 will be a
[37:48] celebration of America like no other,
[37:50] honoring our nation and all of its
[37:52] glory. To help carry out these exciting
[37:55] plans, we have created a new public
[37:58] private partnership. It's called Freedom
[38:01] 250. Working with states, companies, and
[38:04] organizations across the country, we
[38:06] will renew the patriotism, pride, and
[38:09] pioneering spirit of America and lay the
[38:12] groundwork for the next 250 years of
[38:15] independence and freedom. This will be a
[38:17] time like you've never had in your
[38:19] lives. America 250. Thank you. I love
[38:22] you all.
[38:24] Just like bel
[38:28] you back to handwriting on the wall.
[38:32] They had a big big party that night.
[38:36] And what was it all about? They were the
[38:39] greatest.
[38:40] The walls were so thick nobody can
[38:42] penetrate it.
[38:45] They didn't worry about
[38:48] using security on anything because they
[38:50] felt so secure.
[38:53] And here the handwriting on the wall was
[38:55] that there's another nation
[38:58] that's busy going to take over.
[39:05] And now he puts handwriting on the wall.
[39:09] What is the handwriting on the wall now?
[39:14] What do you read?
[39:17] What's on the wall now?
[39:22] Only thing that's on the wall is modern
[39:24] events.
[39:26] America, America, America.
[39:31] That's all that you read about. And he's
[39:36] going to give a big bash.
[39:38] And while they were drinking
[39:42] and going on,
[39:46] the enemy struck.
[39:49] Could it be while the big party is going
[39:52] on this year
[39:54] for a celebration of 250 years of
[39:57] America?
[40:01] Can that thing happen while the party is
[40:05] on?
[40:08] The FIFA World Cup Soccer Tournament
[40:12] look like one of the best spectacles
[40:16] world the world will ever witness.
[40:20] All the world will be represented there
[40:24] and all that I said let the coliseums
[40:28] of America open and the games begins
[40:33] and sudden destruction hit them.
[40:37] What a season for it to go down.
[40:42] What a time
[40:47] while they were partnering
[40:50] for it to go down. While the whole world
[40:53] is watching,
[40:57] I don't know how many billions is
[40:59] watching.
[41:02] She shakes
[41:05] and she sings
[41:08] a tenth part of the earth
[41:13] right at her party.
[41:19] Then
[41:21] we have the king of England is already
[41:24] planning a trip to the USA.
[41:27] Another special occasion.
[41:30] The whole thing this year
[41:33] is a celebration.
[41:38] Will God then use this
[41:41] celebration like he does it right
[41:44] through in the Bible
[41:51] to shake Los Angeles.
[41:57] I feel
[42:00] that the atmosphere and the season is so
[42:03] right right now for it to happen.
[42:09] Is this opportune time for the earth
[42:13] will give way and a tenth part
[42:16] will lay beyond the ocean. you in this
[42:19] message as you listen to your
[42:23] listen to me
[42:26] it's supposed to shape you
[42:28] if it is like that
[42:31] where am I standing
[42:34] how can I keep my peace
[42:38] but preach Matthew 25:10
[42:42] and the doors were shut
[42:45] and the earthquake is going to rock the
[42:48] world
[42:50] and the graves will open
[42:53] and the dead in Christ will rise
[42:58] and we that's alive
[43:01] will be changed by the oil the
[43:03] quickening power
[43:06] to meet the Lord in the air.
[43:11] Now Rome the Pope has closed the doors
[43:13] of Jubilee for 2026. Also,
[43:19] &gt;&gt; this is the final stage marking the end
[43:21] of the Catholic Church's Jubilee 2025.
[43:25] On Tuesday, Pope Leo I 14th closed the
[43:27] holy door of St. Peter's Basilica.
[43:30] Before bringing the celebrations to a
[43:32] close, the pontiff recited the prayer of
[43:35] thanksgiving for the holy year. This
[43:37] holy door is closed but the door of your
[43:39] clemency is not closed was the formula
[43:42] provided by the right. The actual
[43:44] walling of the door will take place
[43:46] privately later in about 10 days. This
[43:50] will bring to a close the jubilee of
[43:52] hope inaugurated by Pope Francis in
[43:54] December 2024 marking the first time in
[43:57] history that a jubilee year was presided
[44:00] over by two popes.
[44:03] &gt;&gt; I didn't know that.
[44:06] I just walked in and preach
[44:09] and the door is shut
[44:13] and closed the door too.
[44:18] And the world sees
[44:21] the pope or whoever it is
[44:24] closing the jubilee jubilee pentecost
[44:30] door
[44:34] 120 years up
[44:37] now how can't I say these things when I
[44:41] see these things how many things did I
[44:44] mention now
[44:47] that actually points to one and one
[44:49] thing only
[44:51] that she's got to rock down to the
[44:54] bottom of the ocean. She must.
[44:59] The sixth vision of William Brham,
[45:02] a woman will rise in the USA.
[45:06] And then he says, well,
[45:08] it might be Rome. Two women and I told
[45:10] you two years ago, the other woman Rome.
[45:15] And I said, "Will Trump
[45:19] spiritually
[45:22] be
[45:24] that
[45:26] other woman
[45:28] Rome?" I ask you if Trump will portray
[45:33] that woman
[45:34] that William Brandham saw the Roman
[45:37] Catholic Church.
[45:40] And I just want to go through this and I
[45:42] can close.
[45:44] Revelations 13:3. Revelations. We know
[45:48] that's America. I don't have to go in
[45:50] there. You
[45:53] heard me preach on it. And you in the
[45:56] message know it's America. Now, in
[45:59] Revelation 13:3,
[46:03] it speaks about the dragon
[46:06] and the beast. Two of them. The dragon
[46:09] and the beast.
[46:11] The dragon roam. Revelation 17,
[46:16] the beast. America, Revelations 13, two
[46:19] of them, America
[46:22] and Rome, or Rome and America.
[46:28] That is already fulfilled. The two of
[46:31] them, it's fulfilled before eyes.
[46:36] Revelation 13:4
[46:40] it says, "Who is like unto the beast?"
[46:44] Trump says, "Who in the world can
[46:48] compare with America?"
[46:51] You heard it. How many times did you
[46:54] know Revelation 13
[46:56] verse 4 was fulfilled? Right there out
[46:59] of his own mouth is fulfilled.
[47:03] So now we have Revelation 13:3 is
[47:06] fulfilled.
[47:08] We have Revelation 13:4 is fulfilled.
[47:12] Especially now when he went in there
[47:16] to Venezuela,
[47:19] he says it just took us
[47:22] so long.
[47:24] We didn't lose anything.
[47:27] &gt;&gt; Late last night and early today
[47:31] at my direction, the United States armed
[47:35] forces conducted an extraordinary
[47:38] military operation in the capital of
[47:42] Venezuela.
[47:45] Overwhelming American military power.
[47:47] Air, land, and sea was used to launch a
[47:51] spectacular assault.
[47:53] And it was a an assault like people have
[47:55] not seen since
[47:58] World War II.
[48:01] It was a force against a heavily
[48:03] fortified military fortress in the heart
[48:06] of Caracus
[48:08] to bring outlaw dictator Nicholas Maduro
[48:11] to justice.
[48:13] This was one of the most stunning,
[48:16] effective, and powerful displays of
[48:18] American military might and competence
[48:23] in American history. Not a single
[48:26] American service member was killed and
[48:28] not a single piece of American equipment
[48:31] was lost. We had many helicopters, many
[48:34] planes, many, many people involved in
[48:38] that fight. But think of that. Not one
[48:41] piece of military equipment was lost.
[48:43] Not one service member was more
[48:46] importantly killed. The United States
[48:48] military is the strongest and most
[48:51] fearsome military on the planet by far
[48:54] with capabilities and skills. Our
[48:56] enemies can
[48:58] scarcely begin to imagine we have the
[49:00] best equipment anywhere in the world.
[49:02] All Venezuelan military capacities were
[49:06] rendered perilous as the men and women
[49:08] of our military working with US law
[49:10] enforcement successfully captured Maduro
[49:14] in the dead of night. It was dark. The
[49:20] uh lights of Caracus were largely turned
[49:23] off
[49:25] due to a certain expertise that we have.
[49:30] It was dark. and it was deadly
[49:34] and everybody is shaking.
[49:40] The second thing of Revelation 13:4 is
[49:43] who can make war against her now?
[49:48] Is that what he says?
[49:50] There's nobody,
[49:52] no army in the world can compare to
[49:58] America. They too advance.
[50:01] When they went in there, they switch off
[50:03] the lights of the whole country. Nobody
[50:05] know how they done it.
[50:07] But is that Bible?
[50:09] That's Bible. Nobody can
[50:14] can fight her.
[50:16] She stops wars and she causes wars.
[50:20] She make law and she break the law and
[50:24] nobody says anything. I do not know if
[50:27] you listen to the news last night,
[50:30] yesterday
[50:32] when Macron and uh the council of
[50:36] Germany and uh
[50:39] uh that English guy spoke.
[50:44] They asked him straightforward
[50:46] questions.
[50:47] Was America right to go into another
[50:52] country and take over? None of them.
[50:55] None of them
[50:58] actually owned up that it's wrong.
[51:02] They all dived away. Why? Because who
[51:07] can make war against her?
[51:10] Brothers,
[51:13] there is somebody that's watching these
[51:15] things.
[51:16] There's nobody in the message that
[51:18] preaches these things and look at these
[51:20] things in L tabernacle.
[51:24] We don't only preach evangelistical
[51:26] stuff and so forth. We want to know
[51:29] what's happening now.
[51:32] What is modern events now? And nobody
[51:36] says anything.
[51:40] But now you'll know
[51:42] that Revelation 13:4
[51:46] is fulfilled.
[51:48] Trump's fulfilled it. Then we got
[51:51] Revelation 13:5.
[51:54] He's given a mouth.
[51:57] The Bible says he's given a mouth. Who's
[52:01] got a bigger mouth than Trump? Everybody
[52:05] speaks about his mouth.
[52:08] Hey
[52:10] Who is more braggadocious
[52:13] than that mouth?
[52:16] Don't you know that that scripture
[52:19] he's given that mouth?
[52:24] And I don't have to say nothing here
[52:26] about that mouth.
[52:28] They say it every day over the radio and
[52:31] over the TV.
[52:33] He likes to yap and he goes over time
[52:36] when he speaks about anything else that
[52:39] mouth just goes like that and you sit
[52:42] there and you don't know that scripture
[52:45] that is Bible
[52:47] and that is also fulfilled.
[52:51] This scripture is also fulfilled.
[52:55] Verse six and seven will come to pass.
[52:57] This is his first term.
[53:00] In his second
[53:03] term,
[53:05] now verse seven,
[53:08] it says power was given him.
[53:12] He's got so much power,
[53:16] not even the UN
[53:18] can stop him.
[53:21] He ignores the world courts
[53:25] and justice courts. He doesn't get taken
[53:28] up. Putin go into a country, he takes it
[53:31] over. He is now a war criminal.
[53:35] He goes in, nobody touches him.
[53:38] &gt;&gt; The foreign minister of Greenland, she
[53:39] said a while ago in a press conference
[53:41] in the embassy of Denmark that she made
[53:43] very clear in the meeting that happened
[53:45] here in the White House, what are their
[53:47] limits? She also said that it was a very
[53:50] respectful meeting. Um, are those limits
[53:53] going to be respected?
[53:55] Well, we're going to see what happens
[53:56] with Greenland. We need Greenland for
[53:58] national security. So, we're going to
[53:59] see what happens. Uh they're going to
[54:01] brief me on the meeting right after this
[54:03] conference.
[54:04] &gt;&gt; In fact, the sooner I get you out, the
[54:06] faster I'm going to know exactly what
[54:07] happened. But we have a very good
[54:09] relationship with Denmark, as you know.
[54:11] We'll see. But, uh you know, we're doing
[54:13] the Golden Dome. We're doing a lot of
[54:15] things and we really need it. Uh if we
[54:17] don't go in, Russia's going to go in and
[54:19] China's going to go in and there's not a
[54:22] thing that Denmark can do about it. But
[54:23] we can do everything about it.
[54:25] &gt;&gt; There's no more than what they can do
[54:26] that.
[54:27] &gt;&gt; Well, we're going to see. I mean, look,
[54:28] we're going to see what happens. Uh, but
[54:30] we need it. You know, I'm not the first
[54:31] one. This was talked about in by
[54:33] President Truman and 40 years before
[54:36] President Truman, they were talking
[54:38] about it. They've been talking about
[54:39] this for 100 years. This is not anything
[54:41] so new. A lot of people don't realize
[54:43] that, but this was a hot subject.
[54:46] Probably not as hot as it is now, but it
[54:48] was a hot subject for a long time. We
[54:49] need it for national security and that
[54:51] includes for Europe and I spoke with as
[54:54] you know Mark the head of NATO
[54:58] and he really wants to see something
[55:00] happen on NATO right now it sounds like
[55:03] you are saying that you would
[55:05] potentially acquire Greenland by force
[55:08] that would be a NATO country united are
[55:10] are you saying that would you do that
[55:12] &gt;&gt; you're saying that
[55:13] &gt;&gt; would you acquire them by force you're
[55:15] telling me that that's what I'm going to
[55:17] do you don't know what I'm going to
[55:19] So what are the options? Your network
[55:21] doesn't know either. The the Danish
[55:23] foreign minister said that there's still
[55:24] fundamental differences after the
[55:26] meeting with Rubio and with the vice
[55:28] president. Are you willing to uh leave
[55:31] the NATO alliance in order to get what
[55:34] you want with Greenland? What are the
[55:35] options right now?
[55:36] &gt;&gt; I won't be telling you what I'm willing
[55:37] to do. Certainly. I'm not going to give
[55:39] up options, but it's very important.
[55:40] Greenland's very important for the
[55:42] national security, including of Denmark.
[55:44] And the problem is there's not a thing
[55:46] that Denmark can do about it if Russia
[55:48] or China wants to occupy Greenland. But
[55:50] there's everything we can do. You found
[55:52] that out last week with Venezuela.
[55:55] There's everything we can do about
[55:57] things such as that. Not going to
[55:58] happen. Uh we're not, you know, I can't
[56:01] rely on Denmark being able to fend
[56:04] themselves off. You know, they were
[56:05] talking about they put an extra dog and
[56:07] they were serious about this. They put
[56:08] an extra dog sled there last uh month.
[56:12] They added a second dog sled. That's not
[56:14] going to do the trick.
[56:15] &gt;&gt; Denmark fought alongside the United
[56:17] States in both Afghanistan.
[56:18] &gt;&gt; Thank you for coming. I appreciate it. I
[56:21] have a living relationship and we'll see
[56:23] how it all works out. I think something
[56:25] will work out.
[56:26] &gt;&gt; What power is that?
[56:30] &gt;&gt; The G20 shake under him. They say we
[56:33] can't do anything until Trump comes.
[56:37] That scripture fulfilled.
[56:42] Never was there a man that had so much
[56:45] power
[56:48] and power was given him.
[56:52] So right behind him
[56:55] there stands
[56:59] the dragon.
[57:03] This is also fulfilled.
[57:05] Revelation 38.
[57:08] Look at all the world trembling before
[57:10] him.
[57:11] presidents run after him.
[57:14] It's only the bride William Brennham had
[57:17] called out. The wise virgin will not
[57:20] fall for the beast and the dragon.
[57:24] Revelations 13, Revelation 17. We can
[57:28] play you the clips that all the
[57:31] presidents shake before him.
[57:35] This scripture also fulfilled.
[57:39] Thank you,
[57:43] Prophet William Brennham.
[57:46] Revelation 13:11
[57:48] got two homes
[57:52] like a lamb Christianity.
[57:55] He gives Israel back
[57:58] Jerusalem.
[58:01] Nice. A lamb Christianity
[58:05] religious
[58:06] horn
[58:09] adhorn political
[58:11] play with politics like a cat plays with
[58:15] a mouse.
[58:18] They can't catch him on politics.
[58:21] He walks over them.
[58:24] Is that your two?
[58:27] But you see exactly
[58:29] no politician stands against him.
[58:34] So, Revelations 13
[58:37] verse 11 also fulfilled.
[58:41] Revelations 13:12
[58:44] and the all the world saw
[58:47] future saw
[58:50] exercise all the power of the first
[58:52] beast before him. He will lead everybody
[58:56] back to the dragon. Most of his cabin
[59:01] is Roman Catholic. We gave you that
[59:04] already. Kennedy is the biggest one.
[59:08] His wife is a Catholic. His children is
[59:12] Catholic.
[59:13] And here's a pig that he looks like the
[59:16] Pope.
[59:19] Catholic.
[59:23] deadly womb which the Protestants
[59:26] afflicted is healed now.
[59:30] How is it healed? She's got American
[59:37] pope.
[59:40] So that healed the wound. America heal
[59:42] the horn. Now you got an American pope
[59:46] which is the dragon.
[59:49] And you got an American president who is
[59:53] the beast.
[59:55] The wound is healed.
[59:58] There's nothing against her.
[1:00:01] Revelation 13:13,
[1:00:03] he does great wonders. He makes fire
[1:00:07] come down from heaven.
[1:00:10] Is that fulfilled?
[1:00:13] He makes fire come down from heaven.
[1:00:17] Did we see how he took over
[1:00:20] with playing the clip?
[1:00:23] How the fire came down from heaven when
[1:00:25] he took Venezuela? How the fire came
[1:00:28] down and took the boats out? Fire came
[1:00:32] down in Yemen. Fire came down out of
[1:00:35] heaven and finish off
[1:00:39] Iran.
[1:00:42] And everybody is shaking.
[1:00:46] Every other president is shaking. He can
[1:00:49] come in any time and take over and
[1:00:52] there's nothing you can do.
[1:00:55] Here is the fire that comes down from
[1:00:57] heaven
[1:00:58] fulfilled.
[1:01:00] Revelation 13:16 and 17. Receive the
[1:01:04] mark of the beast.
[1:01:08] Oil gone. Seal of God gone. But now mark
[1:01:12] of the beast. Not out of Rome.
[1:01:16] the dragon revelation 17 by the mark of
[1:01:19] the beast come out of revelations 13
[1:01:21] America comes the mark of the beast now
[1:01:25] what is the mark of the beast so that
[1:01:27] you can't buy or sell
[1:01:31] who brings the boycott
[1:01:34] who says you're not going to sell oil to
[1:01:35] that place you're not going to do this
[1:01:38] unless we say it who does that the
[1:01:41] buying and the selling now
[1:01:43] not
[1:01:44] Revelation 13.
[1:01:47] Unless you carry his mark,
[1:01:51] unless you agree with him,
[1:01:54] you can't
[1:01:57] make business
[1:01:59] anywhere in the world.
[1:02:05] He says
[1:02:07] we put a boycott on China, Russia, South
[1:02:11] America, Africa. She takes them all.
[1:02:19] And isn't that exercising the power of
[1:02:22] the first beast?
[1:02:24] Who takes them in a time of Jesus?
[1:02:28] Rome.
[1:02:31] Who is this
[1:02:34] fulfilled? Revelations 13.
[1:02:38] We will give you page 218 of this book.
[1:02:43] It must be 120 jubilees to 2026.
[1:02:47] And on page 162, birth of Jesus, 3 and 4
[1:02:52] AD, 4,000 years from creation. From that
[1:02:56] another 2,000 years to 2026,
[1:02:59] 70 jubilees all together 120 jubilees.
[1:03:04] The 6,000 years is over. We need a
[1:03:07] Sabbath.
[1:03:09] Then he brings in the fig tree 1948
[1:03:13] 2028.
[1:03:17] And
[1:03:21] if we should go to Matthew 24:32 as I
[1:03:24] close.
[1:03:26] the fig tree when his branches is yet
[1:03:28] tender when she's still young
[1:03:32] and put forth leaves when it's still
[1:03:35] young. You know summer is nigh. So
[1:03:39] likewise when you see all these things
[1:03:44] the tenderness
[1:03:47] know it is near then he comes back even
[1:03:51] at the door.
[1:03:54] This was angelless even at the door. Not
[1:03:57] it's near, it's even at the door. When
[1:03:59] the door open, it's finished.
[1:04:04] Truly I say unto you, that generation
[1:04:07] shall not pass till all these things be
[1:04:10] fulfilled. If we take 1946
[1:04:14] when the angel told William Marian
[1:04:16] Brham, Israel is a nation
[1:04:21] and we do the maths of it.
[1:04:24] 1946 to 19206
[1:04:28] is 80 years. 80 years this year, that's
[1:04:32] two generations.
[1:04:35] And Jesus says one generation.
[1:04:39] This is not tender branches. She's not
[1:04:41] attended little nation anymore. She's a
[1:04:44] world power.
[1:04:47] So already we in the second generation.
[1:04:54] Could
[1:04:56] this
[1:04:57] be the time
[1:05:00] for Los Angeles
[1:05:04] to go down?
[1:05:06] I leave it up to you
[1:05:09] and
[1:05:11] each one of us
[1:05:13] has a feeling
[1:05:16] and this is my feeling
[1:05:19] that
[1:05:22] she
[1:05:24] without doubt
[1:05:26] is in the right season
[1:05:30] to go.
[1:05:32] I pray that there's such a lot of people
[1:05:35] that don't have the Holy Ghost
[1:05:39] and I don't know where they're going to
[1:05:40] get the Holy Ghost from.
[1:05:43] And the door is shut.
[1:05:47] How they going to make?
[1:05:50] Now not only outside there right here in
[1:05:53] our church al tabernacle
[1:05:57] if you have missed it while sitting in
[1:06:01] tabernacle
[1:06:02] there's not much we can do for you.
[1:06:06] We have run after the backsliders
[1:06:09] all these years
[1:06:13] and uh they didn't come.
[1:06:17] We can't run after them anymore.
[1:06:21] We can only help them that wants to be
[1:06:24] helped.
[1:06:27] So I want to ask the deacons
[1:06:30] to check out
[1:06:33] which of them
[1:06:36] wants
[1:06:38] to go into the door. God bless you.
[1:06:41] Thank you.
[1:06:44] The Bible says there were 120 gathered
[1:06:46] in the upper room according to Acts
[1:06:49] 1:15.
[1:06:50] And in those days Peter stood up in the
[1:06:53] midst of the disciples and said, "The
[1:06:55] number of names together were about
[1:06:57] 120." Now we are 120 years down the line
[1:07:02] after the Holy Ghost came at Isuza
[1:07:05] Street, Los Angeles, California, 1906 to
[1:07:09] 2026
[1:07:11] equals 120 years. Watch that 120. Could
[1:07:16] it be this year?
[1:07:22] An exposition of the seven church ages.
[1:07:25] Nine. The Leodysian church age. The name
[1:07:30] Leodysia which means people's rights was
[1:07:33] very common and was given to several
[1:07:35] cities in honor of royal ladies so
[1:07:38] named. This city was one of the most
[1:07:40] politically important and financially
[1:07:43] flourishing cities in Asia Minor.
[1:07:46] Enormous amounts of property were
[1:07:47] bequeathed to the city by prominent
[1:07:50] citizens. It was the seat of a great
[1:07:53] medical school. Its people were
[1:07:55] distinguished in the arts and sciences.
[1:07:57] It was often called the metropolis as it
[1:08:00] was the county seat for 25 other cities.
[1:08:04] The pagan god worshiped there was Zeus.
[1:08:07] In fact, this city was once called
[1:08:10] Diopoulos, city of Zeus, in honor of
[1:08:13] their god. In the 4th century, an
[1:08:16] important church council was held there.
[1:08:18] Frequent earthquakes finally caused its
[1:08:21] complete abandonment.
[1:08:23] How fitting were the characteristics of
[1:08:25] this last age to represent the age in
[1:08:27] which we now live.
[1:08:32] &gt;&gt; That's solemn warning. We don't know
[1:08:35] what time and you don't know what time
[1:08:37] that this city one day is going to be
[1:08:41] laying out here at the bottom of this
[1:08:42] ocean.
[1:08:45] Oh, Capernium said Jesus, thou who
[1:08:48] exalted into heaven will be brought down
[1:08:51] into hell. FOR IF THE MIGHTY WORKS HAD
[1:08:54] BEEN DONE IN SODOM AND GOMORRAH, it had
[1:08:56] been standing to this day. And Sodom
[1:08:58] Gomorrah lays at THE BOTTOM OF THE DEAD
[1:09:00] SEA, and Capernium's in the bottom of
[1:09:01] the sea. Thou city who claims to be the
[1:09:06] city of the angels,
[1:09:09] WHO'S EXALTED YOURSELF INTO HEAVEN, AND
[1:09:11] SENT ALL THE DIRTY, FILTHY THINGS OF
[1:09:14] FASHIONS AND THINGS TO EVEN THE FOREIGN
[1:09:16] COUNTRIES COME HERE TO PICK UP OUR filth
[1:09:18] and send it away. THROUGH YOUR FINE
[1:09:20] CHURCHES AND STEEPLES AND SO FORTH THE
[1:09:23] WAY YOU DO. REMEMBER, ONE day
[1:09:27] you will be laying in the bottom of this
[1:09:29] sea. You're a great honeycomb under you
[1:09:33] right now. THE WRATH OF GOD IS BELCHING
[1:09:36] RIGHT BENEATH YOU. HOW MUCH LONGER
[1:09:38] YOU'LL HOLD THIS SANDBAR HANGING OVER
[1:09:40] that when that ocean I enter a MILD DEEP
[1:09:41] WILL SLIDE IN THERE, PUMP BACK TO THE
[1:09:43] SALT AND SEA.
[1:09:46] &gt;&gt; IT'LL BE WORSE THAN THE LAST DAY OF
[1:09:47] POMPEI.
[1:09:50] REPENT, LOS ANGELES.
[1:09:52] REPENT THE REST OF YOU AND TURN TO GOD.
[1:09:55] THE HOUR OF HIS WRATH IS UPON THE EARTH.
[1:09:58] FLEE WHILE THERE'S TIME TO FLEE AND COME
[1:10:01] INTO CHRIST.
[1:10:04] &gt;&gt; The ancient Roman city of Pompei was a
[1:10:07] wealthy tourist city that sat on the
[1:10:10] coast near the Bay of Naples. In AD62,
[1:10:14] an earthquake of 7.5 magnitude
[1:10:17] demolished the city of 20,000 people,
[1:10:19] killing more than 2,000. The damage
[1:10:22] extended to the city of Herculanium, and
[1:10:25] the destruction was as extensive as the
[1:10:28] tsunamis in Japan and Indonesia in the
[1:10:31] 2000s.
[1:10:32] Due to an inability to communicate
[1:10:34] immediately, Rome was unaware of the
[1:10:37] earthquake. And on that same day,
[1:10:39] February 5th, the port of Austia in Rome
[1:10:43] was hit by a tidal wave caused by the
[1:10:45] Pompei quake, destroying three ships
[1:10:48] containing a year's supply of grain for
[1:10:51] Rome. The city of Pompei experienced
[1:10:54] extensive damage. On August 24th, AD79,
[1:11:00] Mount Vuvius, directly outside of
[1:11:02] Pompei, erupted for 24 hours, creating a
[1:11:06] bigger disaster than Pompei had already
[1:11:09] seen more than 16 years earlier. The
[1:11:12] eruption was accompanied by two
[1:11:14] different phases. The first was that of
[1:11:17] pummus fallout in which a rain of
[1:11:19] lightweight pellets of pummus and ash
[1:11:22] fell from the sky burying the city in
[1:11:25] 2.5 m of debris. Plenny described seeing
[1:11:29] the plume of ash that rose from the
[1:11:31] mountain as an umbrella pine that
[1:11:33] gradually fell over the surrounding
[1:11:35] areas. The second phase was the
[1:11:38] pyrolastic surge, a 100 mph cloud of
[1:11:42] poison gas and pulverized rock that
[1:11:44] poured down the mountain, engulfing
[1:11:47] everything in its path. The first part
[1:11:50] of the eruption produced total darkness,
[1:11:53] filled with some electric charges, and
[1:11:55] engulfed everything in Pompei and
[1:11:57] Herculanium.
[1:11:59] This killed numerous people.
[1:12:04] The Roman city of Pompei, 1st century
[1:12:08] AD,
[1:12:10] an affluent, vibrant, and progressive
[1:12:13] hub near Naples. With Mount Vuvius
[1:12:16] towering over the city,
[1:12:20] inactive for centuries, the people of
[1:12:22] Pompei had no fear of the great volcano.
[1:12:27] But deep inside Vubuvius,
[1:12:30] molten rock had been leaking from the
[1:12:32] Earth's crust,
[1:12:35] a thick plug of rock in the volcano
[1:12:37] blocked its exit,
[1:12:39] and explosive pressure slowly grew
[1:12:42] inside.
[1:12:45] On the morning of August 24th, 79 AD,
[1:12:48] Pompei was about to meet its fate.
[1:12:54] The volcano finally erupted, sending
[1:12:57] molten rock 15 km into the sky.
[1:13:02] The day turned black as the hot rock
[1:13:06] mixed with the air over Pompei, blocking
[1:13:09] the sun, cooling and falling on the city
[1:13:11] as pmis rock, ash, and rain.
[1:13:17] 4 billion tons of material would fall on
[1:13:20] Pompei within 24 hours.
[1:13:23] Ash and magma collided in the air,
[1:13:25] triggering volcanic lightning.
[1:13:28] As the eruption continued, the magma
[1:13:30] chamber eventually emptied and
[1:13:33] collapsed.
[1:13:40] The first pyrolastic surge towards
[1:13:42] Pompei begins.
[1:13:46] These are groundhogging avalanches of
[1:13:48] hot ash, pummus, and volcanic gas that
[1:13:51] rush towards Pompei at 100 km per hour.
[1:13:59] The first surge falls just short of the
[1:14:02] city,
[1:14:03] but asphyxiation from toxic gas and ash
[1:14:06] killed many.
[1:14:11] 16 hours after the first eruption, the
[1:14:14] volcano column completely gave way.
[1:14:19] &gt;&gt; Pyrolastic waves smashed through houses,
[1:14:25] leaving victims instantaneously encased
[1:14:27] in blankets of ash and pummus.
[1:14:36] The city and its people were frozen in
[1:14:39] time.
[1:14:45] Mount Vuvius buried Pompei in 25 m of
[1:14:50] volcanic rock and ash.
[1:14:59] Pompei was rediscovered by accident over
[1:15:01] 1500 years later in 1594.
[1:15:10] Amen.
[1:15:12] Good evening everybody.
[1:15:15] We greet you in that beautiful name of
[1:15:17] our Jesus, King God.
[1:15:19] As we've listened to this clip
[1:15:23] and we realize
[1:15:26] the lateness of the hour, where we are
[1:15:28] standing,
[1:15:30] where we've come to,
[1:15:32] what time it is,
[1:15:36] we would like to extend this invitation.
[1:15:40] If there's anybody,
[1:15:42] anyone,
[1:15:44] any backslider,
[1:15:47] anybody that feels touched by this
[1:15:51] broadcast that has come,
[1:15:55] we would ask
[1:15:57] that you
[1:16:00] make a way back to God in this last
[1:16:03] call.
[1:16:05] If there's anybody that's convicted out
[1:16:07] there, there's anybody that feels they
[1:16:10] want to come in in this late hour,
[1:16:15] we will
[1:16:17] contact you or you contact us
[1:16:20] and we will look into trying to get you
[1:16:24] in the last call, the last plea in the
[1:16:28] lateness of this hour.
[1:16:31] So take this opportunity, take this
[1:16:34] time,
[1:16:36] take what God is giving you cuz it's
[1:16:39] already too late to even make up your
[1:16:44] mind to make it in. But from the
[1:16:47] ministry, from El Tabernacle to anyone,
[1:16:52] please contact us. We will try our level
[1:16:55] best. Give your heart to the Lord.
[1:16:59] get yourself back to God before
[1:17:03] and if it is already too late, we will
[1:17:06] go this extra mile with you. It's in the
[1:17:09] context that we make this clip and this
[1:17:13] plea the days of Elijah when he said he
[1:17:17] was the only one left. God told Elijah
[1:17:20] opposite on the other side of this
[1:17:22] mountain, I've got 7,000 that didn't
[1:17:26] bow.
[1:17:27] they need to bow.
[1:17:30] Maybe you one that God is calling for.
[1:17:35] And in that context, we extend this
[1:17:38] invitation. Maybe you that one that God
[1:17:42] is waiting for. Be that one. Take the
[1:17:46] opportunity.
[1:17:48] You'll never get it again. May God
[1:17:51] undertake for us all. And may God richly
[1:17:53] bless you. But take this plea, take this
[1:17:58] call, give your heart to the Lord
[1:18:02] and make way, make make a way back to
[1:18:04] God
[1:18:05] in Jesus name. Amen and amen.
