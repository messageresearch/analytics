Description:
A powerful gathering marked by revelation, freedom, and the undeniable move of God. From the call to “Go Tell It on the Mountain” to profound teachings on the oneness of God, His intelligence, and the prophetic utterance of Matthew 25, hearts were stirred and faith ignited. We were reminded of our calling to proclaim the Gospel boldly, to walk in true spiritual freedom, and to recognize that we are living in the time of the greatest works — the manifestation and outpouring of the Holy Ghost.

✨ Truly a convention to remember.
