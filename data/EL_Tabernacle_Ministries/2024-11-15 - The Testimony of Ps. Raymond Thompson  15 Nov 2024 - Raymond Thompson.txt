it it explain um I never even spoke to the family about this type my the first time they will hear about it uh the other thing is this um uh I don't even think brother Raymond remembered this tape it's the tape that we took out of the archives there a lot of tapes in our archives and uh but uh it is um it's encouragement praise God you may be seated at the time a certain lady one [Music] time she wrote a letter to Sister Brandon she said sister bam I want to thank you for your husband says I was in a nervous condition I was taking about 24 PS a day to car my nerves to cool me down and nothing would help since it went on for weeks days months years says but praise God I'm writing this letter of appreciation says because your husband was willing to go to forsake his family forsake his children he was prepared to lay himself and stand in the Gap says he was many miles away from your home he was in our country the doctors had given up hope there was nothing they could do for me but your husband came into the country God sent you there so there I was without hope my children was rued my house was rued say but because someone was willing to go so that night I came into the meeting he called my name he told me what was wrong with me I told you not to worry sister it's all over it say ever since that day I'm a perfect Norm person sister Bram I want to tell you these words it would never have happened if your husband wasn't willing to lay all on the Altar and I believe there's many yet tonight that feels the same way about our precious Pastor I know there's many sitting here tonight who you know through his ministry you've been set free God came into your life God did something praise God [Music] hallelujah praise God when your marriage was ready to break up and in the phone call in the middle of the night he came and set for hours and spoke and brought the two together who was it my brother praise God when that seems there was no God had a man God had a man [Music] amen praise God brother say God once God called man man that's not afraid of the fire of God and this church here tonight is the most you hear what I'm saying you we going to be the most responsible people before almighty God for what God has placed in our life tonight we're going to be the most responsible people tonight in the whole of the world tonight friends praise God oh when it seems like oh Hope Was Gone someone came driving up your driveway and knocked on your door and came and spoke and says brother you're doing the whole thing why someone was willing to go I think it said our brother Bram one time he came home and his own own child didn't even know him when he knocked on the door I think the daughter says the little baby says mommy he has some man at the door and it was his own father praise God what can we say words fail us tonight I'm a witness I like to give Witness what happened in Cape Town as we drove down to brother Layman's funeral tired and we as we got there and there are so many ministers and they gave each Minister a chance to say something there was all the Pentecostal ministers each of them got up and identified themselves and gave all the titles and who they were and what the churches was under them as he went from minister to minister eventually came to the ministers in the message and there were all the ministers and they got up and each one said each thing but there was just no fear some ministers got up and said some nasty things and Tred to stick the pastor I said there since God I've seen you anointing so many times Lord I've seen God with the seems like the the other was against him I see you anointing him Lord and it came to the time where the pastor had to speak brother I never seen something like that in all my life each M had 10 minutes to speak and the pastor came and he ripped out the mic and he says praise God he says Pastor OS he says I come from Jesus Christ praise God it says I got no church but his church and brother when he spoke the anointing of God dropped on praise God in the face of the critics in the face of all the forers in the face of all the HS against him brother the power of God came down and anointed him and the glory of God was in the place in 10 minutes time in 10 minutes time the presence of God the Angels was walking up and down the aisle the glory of God was there praise God the dropped down in 10 minutes time Hallelujah I'm a witness I'm a witness I'm a witness tonight that the glory of God came down all over the building in 10 minutes [Applause] time oh my God I think I believe from tonight on we know it's the truth it's the first time the pastor spoke like he did tonight and I believe from tonight we we're going to pray more for him we believe as his body is tired and weary and the eggs begin to come in the body we're going to be like Moses when he got tired to lift up his hands in prayer and pray for him every morning you get up you remember the pastor's name every morning you get up you call upon his family's name you pray for them and say God give him new Strength God give him a new charge God restore Health God give him a new burst of faith and strength will you do that friends I believe the Bible says pray for them who watch over your souls pray for them pray for them who watches over your souls pray for them brother that watches over your Souls praise God my as apostle said all over there looking for a man to stand in a gap and you know what's going around you know what's happening all over the country the news is out people want some man like this friends people is looking for someone that can bring down the presence of God people is looking for someone that's got reality the world is sick of imitations the world is sick of brother sister Social Gospel but God wants a god call man a God man on the face of the Earth with the anointing of God upon Him Do You Believe don't you appreciate the pastor tonight don't you appreciate his wife tonight let's give the Lord a hand in Praise thank you Lord oh hallelujah thank you Jesus praise God oh Hallelujah words will fail us tonight to go through the things that has happened and transpired through all the years but we want to say we appreciate him tonight praise God want to tell him we appreciate him we're going to stand with him like never before praise God and uh the pastor wants us wants he uh to thank the deacons from his side he appreciate the deacons that have stood with him all the years he wants to say appreciate them praise God from my side I want to say I appreciate the elders the de consy praise God I want to put my appreciation in with the praise God and knowing that the hour is here brother praise God charity never faileth the brotherly kindness is here the honey is here what to stick us together like never before to love your brother with such a Godly love why because godliness is beginning to pour into the Church of God and what is God is a God man praise God to express brotherly kindness you're going to love your brother love your sister love one another and brother says let nothing come between you nothing praise God you refuse to let anything come in between you and your brother you and your sister and you watch brother and sister when that church becomes one and the Revelation becomes one among them like the day of Pentecost when they were in one Accord it says the power of almighty God will drop down and signs wonders and miracles we see it but you're going to see it in a bigger scale brother if we dedicate Our Lives to him don't you love him tonight don't you want to say Lord I Surrender tonight praise God let us stand to our feet praise God there's some uh quotes I wanted to read but praise God everything has been said what can you say brother after such a meeting what can you say to know that Mark 14 the Bible says she did she did everything she could do praise God and I believe we're going to do everything we can do from tonight on we're going to pray like never before we're going to be sincere we're going to do everything the Bible says he did everything she could do and that was to anoint her master and you have it in your power tonight to do everything I don't care what is on your job at home at school you do everything that you can for the master tonight and the Bible says that he was pleased with what he did and I believe God is pleased with what has been done in this church praise God As we sing I surrender all tonight your head bow your eye Clos Lord I surrender all tonight just before we go into the communion tonight Lord I want to surrender my life I want to dedicate it I want to anoint your head tonight God praise God lord I want to I want to anoint it God I want to break the alabaster box tonight God and let the anointing of God flow tonight Lord Jesus we can say like Paul says time fails us to tell about B and all the Great Men of old and I believe time would fail us tonight if we would say and speak about the things that God has done in the ministry of our precious Pastor time would fail us but we want to show more appreciation from our sides more respect praise good so um I was uh told by a young preacher some time ago um what did you all the guys left for us what Legacy did you leave for us and he mentioned U brother becket's name and my name especially and um he um then went on to say all that you guys has left us is fighting and jealousy and bad mouthing one another and you had unkind words all the time against one another and to him it seemed as if this message started that way and that is what we all the brothers has left behind and that made me play this tape because if you listen to this tape here's Raymond Thompson for instance we can play you a tape of Solen and what he says to and it wasn't all dark and Gloom and uh fighting and fussing and at the beginning when we started we were actually watching one another's back way back there we were one in spirit truth way back there so young man if you think that we started with what you call backbiting and fighting and being jealous of one another and had unkind words I played you this tape to show you that at the beginning there was no unkind words on this tape there's no unkind words words on this St there is no ugliness and that was way back there when we started and that's the way it was so I thought I'm going to play the tape um to show these young men or young preachers that has come in it wasn't all the time Doom and Gloom and and bad mouthing we used to have conventions and we all go went to the convention and will convention we were there when uh brother Layman down in Cape Town had conventions we were there when we had conventions out in de Gloria we were there and uh I will admit that afterwards uh things happened and maybe up till now we still have that animosity and fighting and uh because everyone went with with his little Doctrine you know uh we had the peruja doctrine with brother Billy and brother Harold Beckett and uh then we had uh brother Raymond and them and myself with a seventh underd Doctrine and all that but um then afterwards we found out the brother Brenham didn't see a thing like for instance um would say you receive the Holy Ghost without emotions and all that I wanted all the years is to see those words come out of brother brenham's mouth then I believe it but that's not a quote that's not what brother Bram says the same with the thund not so there's where the the the problem started and we started to break up and we had um our scages and uh people didn't greet one another and we don't visit one another's churches and uh because uh I think we got to a place where we were scared we going to lose members well I would say I thought that I wouldn't like to lose more members at that time but uh at before all these doctrines came we didn't have my brother all these fightings and stuff that you see so we left a legacy even our Legacy if I look at you then I ask myself how did you come in here you in the message what Legacy are you leaving have you done anything we were on fire for God we had Fellowship right through the night and uh you don't even have that anymore so uh we U we thought that we would um play this tape um so that you could um understand that when this message started we didn't have what we have today day uh we gave one another accolades like on the tap you heard brother Raymond giving out accolades he was we had conventions together and um we covered one another's backs we move freely to one another's churches if they were was other the churches and um even way back there with brother Beckett was in Joba before we went to Cape Town also we all were together so uh we don't um fight all the way from the beginning the fighting only started afterwards so I play the St to show you what happened way back there and um even the statements that brother Raymond made I'm sure there States out there too that I made statements about brother Beckett being my friend that's why he has in his um study there's nothing like old friends and I can tell you if I phone him uh all these years although we had our differences we still get together and have something to eat with his wife and what have you and we respect one another you know we have our differences so brother don't come with your own ideas about we leaving a legacy like that we didn't leave a legacy like that that's why I know that right now you know like u a certain prominent brother told me what's happening in the states there more people leaving the message than in the message I know things are very critical I know things are very bad but uh it wasn't so way back there so uh I hope that you would uh uh listen carefully how we covered one another's backs may God bless you and uh um maybe you could if you have an opportunity or a chance to uh thank brother Raymond for that accolades that he gave out on the stap may God bless you and there's nothing negative on the St thank you
