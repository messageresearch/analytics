I wonder this time where we are in as we stand. We're going to welcome brother Y to open the word this prayer meeting in a word of prayer. As we bow our heads and we close our eyes, we all bow and close eyes of Jesus, King God. Heavenly Father, it's truly an honor and a privilege, oh God, to approach your throne of grace, your throne of mercy this morning. Oh God, what can we say after a service like yesterday's? Oh God, we are truly blessed, Lord, to have a leadership, oh God, a man of God sent by you, oh Lord. We thank you for him. We pray that you may strengthen him, oh God. You undertake for him. May you guide him in every step of the way. May you just strengthen each and every bone, every fiber in his being. You go before the Rosco family. May you be with him. Keep them in the palm of your hand and my savior. Please, Lord Jesus. May you be with the tabernacle this morning. You fill us with the Holy Ghost. Lord God, we lift up our vessels toward you, oh God. We submit ourselves to you, oh God. Lord Jesus, King God, in everything that we do today, may it all come together in order to give you all the glory, the honor, and the praises. Lord, we ask this in God's name. Amen and amen. Church, don't you just appreciate God's apostle for the powerful message he gave us yesterday? Then you turn around in your homes and just give God, your neighbor, a wonderful hug. Say, "I love you.

[Music] Blessed be the name of the Lord. So good to be in his house this morning on the Sunday sunrise morning. Many people didn't wake up this morning but we thank God that we could see another sunrise, another morning where the sun has risen in our lives. the son called Beth, the son of the living God. We want to say thank you to Jesus, King God, this morning for waking us up and how blessed we are after this combine to hear God's servant to hear the apostle preach a masterpiece. And I could only think last night about of how he threw out theology, threw out tradition out of the water. And it just shows you that if you a son and a daughter of God, if you come from God and you're going back to God again, there's no tradition, there's no situation on earth that you can say this is the way I am. But we've learned the character of Jesus Christ. We've learned the nature of Jesus Christ through a ministry, through a vessel, through an apostle. And I just want to thank God this morning for true leadership because it shows you that there's only one garment. It shows you there's only one way to enter in, and that's through this ministry. Hallelujah. And this morning I just want to start off with a quotation, two quotations and two scriptures before we go into the prayer. It made me think of prophet visit South Africa. Um brother Brandham says during another meeting in Johannesburg, a young boy about seven or eight years old was called up in a prayer line. A prayer line. A prayer line. But the Brandham spoke to the boy for a few minutes explaining that the weak heart which he had was caused by demon oppression. And the apostle said a while back he said that to know the depths of God, you need to know the depths of Satan. And I thank God for an apostle that knows the depths of Satan, that took us out from all our demonology, that showed us the way. Hallelujah. He told him that he would be delivered someday would be preaching and he would be preaching the exact same gospel that was being brought to the people of South Africa. Suddenly, brother Brandham turned to the audience and during a few minutes or moments of silence, it was evident that he was seeing a vision of something over the audience. In other words, the weak heart of the apostle. It's something that he knows the stories we've heard growing up. He knows the underworld. He knows the other side. And I just want to thank God this morning that we have an apostle. We have a leader. We have someone that can take us out from where we came from, from all the things we believed. It just shows you that we have the right ministry. And this morning, I have a grateful heart, a thankful heart. And just one more quotation before I read the scripture. The world is again falling apart. They have a refreshed anointing, anointed word of promise for this age. And he is always the word. If God sent us an anointed promise word again for this age, in other words, you cannot have an anointed age, you cannot have an anointed man, you cannot have an anointed word without the oil. You need the oil to anoint the word. In 1946, he would be the same as he was when he come in the beginning, the anointed word for the age. And El tabernacle, we've got the anointed age. We've got the anointed word and we've got the anointed man. We've got the oil this morning. So, right there in your home, may you reach out this morning. And I believe there's no ministry like this. It's evident that we have the token. Hallelujah. The word of the Lord says in Luke the 18th chapter and he said and spake a parable unto them to this end that men ought to always pray and not faint. You always got to pray. You don't have to faint this morning. saying, "There was in a city a judge which fearth not God, neither regarded man, and there was a widow in the city, and she came and said unto him, saying, Avenge me of mine adversary, and ye would not for a while, but afterwards he said unto him, Though I fear not God, nor regard men, yet because this widow troubleth me, I will avenge her, lest by her continually coming, she worry me. And we were taught that whatever you ask God in prayer, you ask and you ask and you ask until God answers that prayer. And this morning, we want to wear him this morning. We want to ask God this morning. We want to plead our case this morning. Hallelujah. One more scripture before we go into the prayer. Judges 16 verse 26. And Samson said unto the lad that held him by the hand, suffer me that I may feel the pillars whereupon the house standeth, that I may lean upon them. Now the house was full of men and women, and all the lords of the Philistines were there. And there were upon the roof about 3,000 men and women that beheld while Samuel Samson made sport. And Samson called unto the Lord. He prayed and said, "Oh Lord God, remember me. I pray thee the strength and strengthen me. I pray thee only this once, oh God. He asked for a once more, Lord. And this morning, we want to ask for a once more, Lord. Because I believe that in this house, there is someone in this house that standing between the pillars, the vessel of oil. There's a pot of oil in our house this morning. And I believe we have the right pot of oil. We have the right vessel that can answer our need. Just there in your home, wherever you are. There's no moment like this moment. There's no moment like the present time you're in right now. As the apostle said yesterday, he said it's about the today. It's a fresh anointing. So why don't we pull down that fresh anointing when you go to work on a Monday, on a Tuesday, no matter what moment you're in. The fact that we saw the sun come up this morning, it's a new day. It's a new chance. It's a new opportunity to show the Messiah that we are alive. As we bow our heads this morning, gracious eternal heavenly father. Lord, you are wonderful. Lord, you are God, Lord. You are the mighty conqueror. You are the prince of peace. You are the lily of the valley. You are the bright, the morning star. Father, this morning we humble our hearts to your throne. We thank you that we could feel the brush of angels wings. We thank you Lord that we know which kingdom we belong to. We thank you this morning Lord that we know that our answer Lord is found in you oh Lord Father. And this morning we want to say that we love you. We appreciate you Lord. Lord as your people has gotten up this morning Lord to plead their case Lord. We realize Lord that we are in a ministry father that has the answer Lord. Lord we are in a ministry Lord that we know that we know that we know that you have made a way for us. Oh Father Lord you have called us oh Lord. Lord you have washed us Lord. You have made us whole Lord. And this morning we humble ourselves to your throne. Thanking you Lord that you are not just a God that we do not see but we feel you Lord. We see you Lord. We know that you are there Lord. And just to know that we have the opportunity this morning that we have the opportunity father Lord to come into your courts Lord with thanksgiving and a joyful heart. Lord, we are so grateful this morning because you are our God, Lord. Lord, we do not believe in fables, Father, but we know that there's a land beyond the river called somewhere, somewhere somewhere, Lord. And we want to say thank you this morning for your house, oh Lord. We want to say thank you this morning that you are God, Lord. Lord, you are so wonderful. You are so kind. You are so gentle. You are our savior. You are our king Lord. And this morning we humble ourselves to your throne. Knowing Lord that our strength, knowing that our joy, knowing that a brand new touch is in stock for us this morning, Lord. Lord, and we cannot sh to declare that you are with us, Lord. Lord, we cannot help ourselves this morning because we realize, Father, that you made a way through it all. Through it all, through it all, Lord, when we were at our lowest, you came our way, Father. And this morning, we want to say thank you, Lord. We want to lift you higher. We want to lift you even the more because you are a good God, Lord. Lord, and you are a wonderful God, Lord. Lord and you are a blessing in our lives, Lord. Lord, we do not want to just leave you one side, Father. But we want to embrace you this morning. We wanted you to come and kiss each and every heart in each and every home. May you come with a fresh anointing. Lord, may you come and visit El Tabernacle this morning, Lord. Lord, we want to say you are God. You never changed. We want to say that you are our Lord and you never change, Lord. Lord, you are still the same this morning. You are still the same God in our lives. And we want to lift you higher this morning. We want to give you the Tahilas this morning. We want to give you the toas this morning. We want to say, Lord, even so, come Lord Jesus. Because in you there's life. In you there's another chance in you, Father God. There is there is there is something Lord in the nothing. Oh Lord, there is always something in nothing, Lord. Lord, you are always there when we least expect it, Father. Lord, and your people this morning, we want to say we are your people, Lord. We want to say we love you this morning. We want to say we appreciate you, Lord. We want to say you are God this morning. Lord, we do not want to replace you. We know that you are a jealous God. Lord, we know that you are a jealous God. Lord, let us not put anything in your place this morning, but let us come with a made up mind that we know that we know that we know who our creator is, who our father is. Lord, you said ask and it shall be given unto you. You said knock and I will open the door. You said walk through the Red Sea. I will make a way, Lord. And this morning we know that there is a power from on high. We do not need a song this morning. We do not need anything from this world, but we have the answer. We have the oil. We have the anointing. We have the brush of angels wings. Father, this morning we humble ourselves. We speak the word, Lord, and we taking a positive step in the right direction, Father. Lord, may you forgive us where we fail you. May you try us out even the more, Lord, because we love you, Lord, because we want to be right, Lord. Lord, you said in your word that a Christian falls seven times. A righteous man, he falls, Lord. But we know the answer, Father, this morning. We know that we just got to get up again. We know that we just got to dust ourselves off and you will step in, Lord. You will bless the upkeep, Lord. You will bless the man of the house, Lord. As we look to your servant, Father, as we look to this ministry, Lord, we know that the hope that we have, it make us not ashamed. This morning we know that we have a hope. This morning we know that we have the answer. This morning Lord, there is no devil in hell that can keep a child of God bound because we know where our power comes from. We know where we come from and we know where we are going to this morning. Set the people free this morning. On the Sunday morning. on the Sunday morning, on the S O N. Lord, may you walk in our lives. May you ride in our lives, Lord, as the son of righteousness with healing in his wings. Lord, if there's someone this morning that needs healing this morning, Lord, if there's someone that needs a touch this morning, Lord, if there's someone that needs your heart to come to them this morning, Lord, may you open up the windows of heaven, may you open up the windows of heaven this morning, sister, my brother, may you touch the hem of his garment.

If there's anyone that's afflicted with demon oppression, with demon oppression this morning, may you come their way, may you be, Father God, the powerhouse this morning. Because Lord, we know where our power lies, oh Lord. Lord, we know which kingdom we come from. We know that on Saturday night, Lord, you went down to hell, Lord, and you kicked open the door, Lord, and you took the keys of hell, death, and the grave, Lord. There is no devil. There is no demon that you haven't seen before. Lord, there is no demon in hell that you do not know. Lord, when you were on earth, you came, Lord. And the demons cried out. Have you come to torment us already, Lord? They know you. They know you, Lord. Lord, and I know they know us, oh Lord. They know the power in this church. They know the power in this man.

It's yours this morning." God bless you. Hallelujah. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] [Music] Jesus. [Music] May your good Lord bless and keep you. May he make his face to shine upon you.
