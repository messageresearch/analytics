So, God bless you. And if you can turn to your Bibles, we'd like to read from Psalm chapter 63. Amen. Amen. Psalms chapter 63 verse one says, "Oh God, thou art my God. Early will I seek thee. My soul thirsteth for thee. My flesh longeth for thee. In a dry and thirsty land where no water is to see thy power and thy glory. So as I have seen thee in the sanctuary because thy loving kindness is better than life. My lips shall praise thee. Thus will I bless thee while I live. I will lift up my hands in thy name. My soul shall be satisfied as with marrow and fatness, and my mouth shall praise thee with joyful lips. When I remember thee upon my bed, and meditate on thee in the night watches, because thou has been my help, therefore in the shadow of thy wings will I rejoice. May God add blessing to the reading of his word. Let us bow our hands as we want to pray and ask God's blessing upon the service this morning. Let's lift our hands.

They can't say cannot enter. Amen. And one day we be approaching heaven's doors like that. They can't kick us out. The angels have to welcome us. Because we are sons and daughters of the living God. So I want to thank all of you for your support for the Easter meetings here at the headstone tabernacle. I want to certainly appreciate all of you as one sister commented how smooth things were executed in the absence of brother Isaac and myself and it's a sign truly of a growth and I love that we have not injected ourselves into the people. So the church must go on. Amen. Praise God. So we see it and we bless the Lord. Thank you all who participated in the branch. Those who have helped, serve, contributed, supported with bacon, cooking, all that was done to make it such a successful event. I want to say I truly thank you. I praise the Lord. I I want to appreciate also brother Gideon, brother Anthony, brother Steven for standing in the gap to share the word of God with you that could be blessed. And uh the turnout was great. So that shows that you're not coming to see a man or men, but you're coming to hear what God have to say. That's the training that we always desired of you. So if we put on a tape, we bring somebody from outside, doesn't matter who is to speak the word. We are not connected to flesh and blood. I was tell my wife something and say, you know, it's so foolish. All this thing about race is so stupid. It's so dumb. Because the original man is a spirit man. You not seeing me. God put this train that brown dust over this thing. And if if we had to fade away as a skull and and and and and bones there and God could hang yellow flesh around it. God could hang white flesh around it. God could hang black flesh around it. And but the real person is on the inside. It's not this outside man. So people fighting with this outside man. This man have to go back to the ground. You know he said dust thou shalt return. We we like animals in that sense. outside flesh but the inside have a soul and that's where you come in and that's what what what what make you respond to the word of God is what God put inside of you. Oh praise God. So greetings again from Ivory Coast powerful meetings and this morning you're going to hear what we're going to play the last service first last service where Isaac spoke tremendous tremendous meeting and I want to share something before I put on that tape. It's not a long service. So we want to share something before That tape comes on and was saying Noah's time they had great giants and today they got those great intellectual giants in the land too. I hate to say this if there is one here. I hope I don't hurt you. He's talking to if any intellectual giant was sitting there. I don't want to hurt you but it is Satan spies again. in the church is fine. And you say sure intellectual giants come around to prove that all the shouting and saying amen and going to the altar and breaking up because of your sins, that's emotion. That's intellectual talking that they want everything without sensation. They dancing calypos so they going to band so they ain't going football. So they going cricket so they're not going to no sports like that. So but they come to come to church and stone dead. Satan inject them with some kind of com something. But when you come here, you come to worship because that's what Jesus told the woman at the well. And you know, worship is not about your problems and your situations. Worship is about who God is. As long as you recognize who God is, you come to worship him. Sometimes you worship him and he come and bring an answer for you. You worship him and he bless. He's a person. You know, God is not a it. You know, he's a person, you know, a person he could talk to and get answer from. You know, I heard the Lord. He heard my cry. I cry unto him. Oh, glory to God. You could hear you. You know, you could start from where you are. I'm in the pit, Lord. Deliver me. I'm in prison, Lord. Open up them prisons. I am sick. Lord, heal me. I am dumb. Lord, pick me up. I need a revival. I need a breakthrough. I'm a boozer. I'm a drinker. I'm a drug addict. Deliver me. Free me for what I am. Oh, give the Lord some praises. Glory to God. Remember, they came out of Egypt, but Egypt didn't come out of them. Glory to God. That's why they were in the condition they were in. You could come out, but the thing that you come out are still inside of you. You're delivered when it get out of you. When your desire has changed. When your nature has changed, when your thinking has changed, then you are changed. Oh, give the Lord some praises. Come on, church. Don't change you. The word does. God does. The fire does. Oh, glory to God. Not your intellectual mind. [Applause] That's intellectual giant. There's no such thing. Walk up, dry eye, say, "Well, I'll join this church. I believe Jesus Christ son of God." Satan does too. And no sign he is saved. That's right. It takes more than that. It takes a new birth. It takes a new birth. Not just saying that it takes something that happens in here that makes you something happening here that makes you different. Amen. Praise the Lord. So the prophet was talking about a rookie in the army packing uh so much of thing on their back for training and whatnot. And when we came to the airport there, I saw so much army people. I don't know. I don't know what they're here for. If they're going to Venezuela, if they coming election, I don't know what they're here for. But if you see some woman there and they packing some big back on their back, I say, "Wow." Oh, we talking about women and men. You know, if you see the size of them things, if you put an back, you fall right down with that. But the train, the army, they not selling snow cone in the army. When you come here, you come here to get in court. So you come here, get a backpack. Not other people monkey on your back. You know, people get people business in your back and you're walking and you have poisons with other people. Don't do that. You know, you have enough of yourself. You know, walk with nobody back. So Bam say he got this new suit on and and 90 lb pack and all these shovels and hand grenades and everything else. He said that is why the all wise God equipped his army with the baptism of the Holy Ghost. He know these intellectual giants would stand in this last day. He know they will stand and they will be able to explain by their great wisdom and the powers of Satan like a roaring the lion. But he said, "I will not leave you comfortless. I am going to be with you." So he equipped his army with the baptism of the Holy Ghost to deal with these intellectual giants. Oh, blessed be. That's why you can't use your mind inside of here. You can't use your feelings. You have feel to come to church this morning. Tell your feelings stay home. We going put your feelings to one side. If you follow your feelings, you get in trouble there. Know there's no feel good. Do it. You know it's what God said. Isn't that right? So, okay. So, they are intellectual giants. They are men, great men, powerful men. They know Greek. They know Hebrew and can set together and settle together. So, intellectual. But where is the revival? Where is that God that burns the heart of the human being? Not how intellectual it is. Here we go. It takes simplicity to bring the power of God. Because we know now all the mysteries and all the crazy revelations and mutual revelations and mighty revelations, it bring down no power. And if you give them a chance next 50 years, they'll be talking the same talk that they talking the last 50 years past. So it will take something to break through. And that is what I want to be pulit in your heart like a beep boop boop because that's that's what Jacob had. You know, Jacob wasn't the best of believer and best he was a trickster. He's a man. If you see Jacob, I no fool with him, you know. But you know what God love about Jacob? He had a heart for the birthright. He had a heart for the Holy Ghost. He had a heart for the things of God. And go I love that man. He trickster now. He doing all kind of skully, all kind of thing now. But you see he I love that man. Because a man who have a heart like that, he could change. You have to have a heart for it. And God already put it in your heart. That's why you're here this morning. You had just come here this morning. He said all who we for we called. All we call it justified. already justified. He already glorified. God had to put the desire inside of you or you stayed just as you are. So you didn't pull yourself. You didn't call yourself. Jesus said it this way. You have not chosen me, but I have chosen you. He chose you as you are. But you're not going to remain as you are. Oh, give the Lord some praises tonight. Hallelujah. You are God's choice. As miserable as you are, as terrible as your behavior is, watch me like I'm not talking to you. we're talking to. Hallelujah. Your mouth loose, but God still choose you. Your behavior this way and that way, but God still choose you. Tell the devil he's a liar this morning. God has chosen [Music] [Applause] me. Glory to God. Hallelujah. I don't know what condition and past and history that shape you as you are to be as you are. That's not important to God. Because when God saw the woman in the well, he wasn't watching with a woman, how much man she had and who she was with and who she wasn't with. He was looking at the seed in her soul. He had the book. He had her name. She know who she was. And God know who you are. Oh, give the Lord some praises. He can bring you out this morning. Oh, he can deliver you this morning. That's why we are here to preach the gospel to every creature. That's why we are here to free to see you loosed from your bands. Almost done here. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Brother Brandon, there are so many voices in the earth today. That is absolutely a hard thing because it deadens the voice of the supernatural. So therefore, everybody on Facebook, every on Tik Tok, everybody have a voice. Everybody is reporters, everybody trying to do something for likes, laughs, whatever they want to do for, right? So watch something now. There are so many intellectual voices, great voices of mighty man who are intellectual and in their intellectual conditions even shake the nations. They are not overnight people but they shake nations. They bring big floral campaign and a person would be a bit confused and how these things can go on and prosper. And there's voices that raise up that do these things and causes the voice of God to be placed way back somewhere. The true voice of God and the voice of God they say, how will we know it's the voice of God? Because then it was in a vindicated prophet today. How will we know it's the voice of God? Because here we go. It's a manifestation of the prophet's word. Amen. That's how we know it's the voice of God. Not because the man talking 4 hours and 5 hours and explaining the mysteries. That is not the voice of God. That that does not mean that the voice of God. It must be the manifestation of the prophet's word. Here we go. And a true voice of God only brings back that real living supernatural God with his supernatural word with his supernatural sign that we know is the voice of God. There is so much in the other but it will glisten. It will come forth. And the last quote I have here is about David. David was sent, we know to face Golad. Golad, one of them giants in the land. And then B said this here. And and and when David was about to leave, that's when Golad came for. He didn't know Golad was around. He just saw those brothers sharpening the sword and whatnot. And they're not looking up. They're just sharpening. That people sharpening because the challenge of Goliath was send me send a man to fight me. And you cannot defeat what you're not prepared to confront. So burying a head in the sand doesn't deal with your issues or doesn't deal with your giants. You have to understand there's a giant and I have to deal with it. I don't know how. I don't know when. I don't know what. But it has to be dealt with. And you have to confront your demons. You have to confront your giants. You have to confront your issues. I say confront it. Not dock it. Confront it. Not putting it back in your mind. Confront it. Deal with it. Oh, glory to God. This is the age. When I was a child, I talked like a child. I spoke like a child. But when I became a man, I put up with childish things. You have to deal with things as a man. So David give the testimony. I had a bear. I deal with it. I had a lion. I deal with it. That goliath going to be just like them things there. Give the Lord some praises. Glory to God. And then the prophet begin to prophesy. He said God is got a lot of sheep that gone astray. Organization that stole them out, brought them into psychology. God, give us David's with the word of God and the power of God to direct it when we go and meet these intellectual giants. Give me the word of God and the power of the Holy Ghost. And I tell you, we can slay every giant on the field. Praise God. So this morning, I know you're going to be blessed. The inspiration that I had was every giant must fall. Oh, praise the name of the Lord. Let's all stand as we want to go straight into the tape now. It's not a long tape, but you'll be blessed this morning. God bless you. going straight to the the Ivory Coast. Praise the Lord. for the name of the Lord. I power the [Music] righteous. I bless the name. I bless the name. Blessed be the name. Blessed be the lamb of the Lord. Hallelujah. Bless the name. Bless be the lamb. Oh, blessed be the name. Bless be the name. Blessed be the name of the Lord. The lord is savior. [Music] sing. Hallelujah. Oh, I said oh [Music] baby I [Music] God [Music] listen to him face to [Music] face where there be no more. We [Music] don't [Music] see where no more we shall be changed.

[Applause] Amen. Amen. What a great time in the presence of the Lord. Are we happy to be here at the convention? Have we been blessed? Amen. I would like to greet you tonight one more time in the precious name of Jesus Christ. And I want to thank you all. [Music] making the convention the convention. Without you there is no convention. So we salute the bride of Christ in our presence for your faith for your fire for the anointing for making a church. I will make a revival. And we know without a shadow of a doubt he who started the work is more than able to bring it to pass. So we love you. We appreciate you. I want to salute brother Paul one more time for the vision to have the convention. We love you brother Paul, your family, the church. Amen. Amen. And all the helps and governments. There's a lot that goes into a convention and we don't ever want to take it for granted. You know, one of these days we'll have our last service. One of these days we'll sing our last song because one of these days this battle will be all over. But until that time comes, we will do everything we can for the kingdom of the Lord. You may be seated. I want to take one more time to salute the servants of God, the Levites who carried the ark of the covenant and brought the word of God to us this week. Brother Solomon Nachina, brother Stephanos, brother Theo, you appreciate the men of God. And we thank the Lord for that. What services? What an anointing. You may be seated. And tonight it's the final service. It's amazing how quickly the time goes by. Felt like the first service we were just in the first service. We already in the final service. But by the grace of God, we are here to do one thing. Give the devil one more punch. We are here to give the devil the knockout punch. And for you who are here, this knockout punch may not even be for you. It could be for your family. It could be for your son. It could be for your daughter. So if you didn't give it your all in all the previous [Music] services, a few moments before the prayer line. I don't care if you use your [Music] hand. If you use your feet, it doesn't matter. One more knockout punch for the honor and glory of God. [Applause] So if we could take off, if we could stand for the reading of the word. By the grace of God tonight, I want to preach a message of faith before the prayer line and we will see what God will do. I have two portions of scripture. Reading from the book of Matthew and reading from the book of Joshua. One verse in Matthew, chapter 1 verse [Music] one and Joshua 14. Matthew 1 verse one, the book of the generation of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham. [Music] Reading Joshua 14 and reading from verse six. Then the children of Judah came unto Joshua in Gilgal. And Caleb the son of Jeffa the Kennzite said unto him, Thou knowest the thing that the Lord said unto Moses, the man of God concerning me and thee in Kadesh Bania. 40 years old was I when Moses, the servant of the Lord, sent me from Kadesha to espy out the land, and I brought him word again as it was in mine heart. Nevertheless, my brethren that went up with me made the heart of the people melt, but I wholly followed the Lord my God. And Moses sway on that day, saying, Surely the land whereon thy feet have trodden shall be thine inheritance, and thy children's forever, because thou hast wholly followed the Lord my God. And now, behold, the Lord hath kept me alive, as he said these 40 and five years, even since the Lord spake this word unto Moses, while the children of Israel wandered in the wilderness. And lo, I am this day four score and five years old. As yet I am as strong this day as I was in the day that Moses sent me. As my strength was then, even so is my strength now for war, both to go out and to come in. Now therefore give me this mountain whereof the Lord spake in that day. For thou heardest in that day how the anarchims were there and that the cities were great and fenced. If so be the Lord will be with me, then I shall be able to drive them out as the Lord said. And Joshua blessed him and gave unto Caleb the son of Jeffa Hebron for an inheritance. Hebron therefore became the inheritance of Caleb the son of Jeffa the Kennzite unto this day because that he wholly followed the Lord God of Israel. And the name of Hebron before was Kathaba, which Aba was a great man among the Anakims, and the land had rest from war. May the Lord had a blessing to you. Shall we pray? Our gracious heavenly father, We thank you tonight for this last service. And Father, we pray that your Holy Spirit would take complete control. May you walk out the pages of the Bible. May you speak to your people. May you take me out of the way. May you raise the faith of the people. Lord, as we prepare for the prayer line, May we take every spirit under control for the honor and glory of God. May you have your perfect way in the precious name of Jesus Christ. And the church says and the church says, "Amen." You may be seated. So I have a strange title tonight. The mystery of Caleb between Abraham and David. Abraham. The mystery of Caleb between Abraham and David. Abraham. And for an inspiration, every giant must fall. Every giant must fall. And in this meeting, we serve notice [Music] on every giant. Because if you read the Bible, every giant that was found in scripture was destroyed. Almighty God did not allow any giant to survive. the sons of God destroy every giant and the church say and I believe in this convention we are serving notice of every giant I don't care if that giant is sickness I don't care if that giant I don't care if that giant It doesn't matter. Every giant must fall. We are not leaving this convention until every time. We are not leaving coast until every time the church say we serve notice tonight. If that giant is cancer tonight, that giant must fall. If that giant is high blood pressure tonight, that giant must fall. I don't care what the sickness is. Every giant, every giant, not one giant survive tonight. [Music] Amen. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. You may be seated for a minute. We read that scripture, the book of the generation of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham. So Jesus was pleased to identify himself as the son of David and the son of Abraham. So I asked a question. There must be a connection between something Abraham between something. You don't hear me say amen. Now we know that Abraham Abraham was the father of faith. We know that when God started to build his people, [Music] Isaac, Jacob, Joseph, the whole line of Israel parted with Abraham. God told Abraham that thy seed shall possess shall possess the gates of the enemy. But more than that, he told Abraham, look to the left, look to the right, look behind him, look in front of you. Everything you see. Everything you see belongs to you. Can the church say amen? So Abraham Abraham was the foundation. Are you with me? God spoke to Abraham when he was 75 years old. God gave him a promise of a son. But he gave him a promise, a [Music] landmark land. They are giants in the [Music] [Applause] land. Can the church say amen? Amen. That's why we say tonight, every child, every child must [Applause] [Music] [Applause] fall. Let's go. Continue. Abraham Abraham is 75 years old. God tells him, "All the land is your land." When Lot left him and told Lot, choose where you want to go. And when Lot walked away, Abraham, look around you. All is yours. Listen carefully. Abraham Abraham didn't have an army. Could it be? I'm looking at Abraham's army. When Abraham received the promise, he did not have the people to fulfill the promise. You don't hear me tonight. Abraham Abraham had the promise. He didn't even have a child land. You don't hear me this say amen. Amen. [Applause] I'm dropping some seeds in here. Remember my title, the mystery mystery of Caleb between Abraham and David, it's important. So Abraham Abraham, he is getting older. He is getting older. and he knows that there's a land that belongs to him. But read the Bible. There is no scripture that shows that Abraham possessed the land. [Applause] God gave him the land. [Music] But Abraham Abraham never got to possess it. In Genesis 23, the Bible tells me that Sarah died. She was 127 years old. [Music] Abraham Abraham was 137 years old. He knows about the promised landmine is going to possess it. There's something in here. So when Sarah dies, the Bible says that Abraham Abraham went to the Hittites. And he said, "I want to buy. I want to purchase piece of land so I could bury my wife." Now, I want you to notice this is land in Canaan. God already gave him this land, but he doesn't have the army to possess the land yet. But Abraham knows the resurrection, the promise, the power is in the land. So Abraham Abraham goes to the Hittites and say, "Sell me a piece of land." They say to Abraham, Abraham, whatever land you want to get, bury your family, we will sell it to you. Abraham says, "There's a piece of land that I like. I like I see a piece of land that I like. That piece of land looks a certain way and in that land it has a piece that looks like a mountain. That land has a cave. [Music] And the Bible says that Abraham Abraham paid 400 400 pieces of silver to buy Hebron. [Music] [Applause] So Abraham, Abraham, God gave him the land. In order to bury Sarah, he for the land, land called Abram. So he could bury her. The Bible says, Abraham, Abraham was buried in Hebron. Sarah was buried in Hebrew. All the patriots were buried in Hebrew. Now listen, it's one thing for somebody to give you land. It's a whole different story. When you pay for land, this particular piece of ground called Hebron was given to Abraham and Abraham paid for. So there were two reasons to fight for this particular ground. It was given to him and he paid for it. No wonder Caleb said Give me this mountain. You don't hear me tonight. You don't hear me tonight. A lot of land that's part of the promised landing this mountain. I know that God gave me the land. But Abraham, he paid for this people. This is the thing I want. Abraham is buried here. Sarah is buried here. Now therefore, give me this mountain. [Applause] Listen, when Abraham Lord Abraham paid for the land, there were No giants there. [Music] [Applause] It would have been very difficult to do a funeral service for Sister Sarah if there were giants there. But over the passage of time, God told Abraham, "Your people, your seed will sjourn in a strange land. And for 400 years, they were in bondage in Egypt. While they were in bondage, giants inhabited the land. You don't hear me. You don't hear me. While they were in bondage, giants inhabited the land. And when man fell in Genesis, man have been in bondage, and giants had infested the land. [Applause] I've got good news. Bondage is temporary. Bondage is temporary. When God was ready, he said, "I have heard the cries of my people in [Music] Ira and I have come down. I have come down. I have come down. [Applause] I have forgotten to look at my notes. I'm still on page one. You are helping me to preach. Listen. When Moses left Egypt, I want you to understand in the book of Deuteronomy, chapter 3, the Bible tells us, the first major battle, Moses had to deal with was a king named King Og. The Bible said, He was the last of a line of giants. So the first giant killer in the Bible was Moses. Moses, God told Moses. Do not fear him. Do not fear that giant. You will take that giant. Can the church say amen? Amen. I want to encourage you church in that battle. There would have been a young brother in the front of the convention. That young brother saw. When Moses killed that giant, that young brother kept it in his heart. [Applause] This young brother was special. Because this young brother was not a [Music] [Applause] Jewish Bible says that he was a Kennesite. It meant he was from the land of Canaan. something in his heart attracted him to the convention in Ivory Coast. Anybody with me? There are 12 tribes in Israel. I don't know how this Kennesite gets to join the tribe of Judah. But this genocide came to be known as Caleb of the tribe of Judah. Now listen, Moses is anointed. Moses is inspired. He said, "I want 12 ministers [Applause] to go investigate the land. Find me your 12 bless men. The tribe of Simeon. They got a brother who was on [Music] fire. They got the from the tribe of God. They got a brother on fire. From the tribe of Reuben, brother on fire. from the tribe of Napali tribe of Zebulun. All these brothers, faithful brothers, they born in church. They grow up in church. When they call the tribe of Judah, there's this brother coming up. He doesn't look like a Jew. He doesn't walk like a Jew. He's a gentile. team. He's a gentile. In addition to He's a gentile. [Applause] So friends, 12 brothers. 12 tribes, 11 Jews, one Gentile, Joshua and Caleb. They pull to the side because they moving different. Their faith is different. Their expectation is different. Their understanding is different. Their revelation is different. Their is different. is different. Hope is different. Is different. [Applause] church. 12 brothers [Music] have all the quotes, all the books, all the know what God did. They knew he took them from Egypt. They knew he took them through. But when they got to the land, Joshua and Caleb, they were eating grapes, drinking milk, had a spoon of honey. Some giants passed by. Caleb kept eating. He kept eating. He kept eating. He kept eating. He didn't move. He wasn't scared. He knew that the bride had a revival. He knew seven thunders. He knew seven. He knew that the book was open. Hallelujah. Every giant [Music] [Applause] church, brother Brandham taught us to be true ministers. will misunderstand this prophet. [Applause] But Joshua and Caleb, listen, the other 10 brothers, I am not sure if they ate one grape. [Music] The other brothers when they saw that the promise of the Holy Ghost just as real, they scratched their head giant of unbelief. Those 10 brothers ran back to Moses and they gave a report and I want you to picture the people and and Joshua and Caleb, they are running back to camp. They are running back to [Music] Captain Caleb's shirt. When he went to the land, it was a white shirt. When he came back, it was a purple shirt, grape [Music] juice, milk, food. He said we are going [Music] to let us go up at once. Let us go at once. Let us go tonight. Let's go now. [Applause] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. [Applause] Church, we know the story. The Bible said that the children of Israel tried to stone Joshua and Caleb. Could you imagine the thing we fought for all these years? All of these conventions, all of these meetings, all of this sacrifice, and you want to tell me I have to go home the way that I came, you got to be kidding me. You have to be kidding me. After all these years, I'm going to miss the rapture. You have to be kidding me. We are more than able. We are more than able. Sickness is defeated. Unbelief is defeated. Tonight, every giant must fall. [Applause] [Applause] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. [Applause] Church, the scripture we read for years, Caleb had to walk in the wilderness because of unbelief. They did not take the land. But you know what I love about Caleb? The scripture we read. He said, "My brethren who did not believe." Listen, he didn't even speak bad about them. He still called them brethren. Said, "My brethren, made the people's heart to melt. But here I stand 2025. I'm 85 years old. I was 40 years old. When we started this journey and in this year I'm just as strong. The message is just as strong. The anointing is just as strong. Foxy Fox. [Applause] [Music] [Applause] Moses Moes killed one giant. [Music] I don't know if Moses had advanced warning [Music] that a giant was the next [Music] challenge because along's life's journey you meet challenges that you have not prepared for. that you never had to deal with. Kill him. He saw these giants before over 40 years ago. These were the same giants. There were no different giants, the same ones that he saw before that was still there. He said, "I am ready to go up." He said, "If God is with me, I don't even need help. If God is with me, I don't need my brothers. If God is with me, I am more than able. And tonight, if the Lord is with us, we are more than able to start a revival [Music] that will change the [Music] world church. This is not the Ivory Coast Convention. Not the earth. You don't hear me tonight. You don't hear me tonight. Tonight we shall notice every giant every country this earth belongs to us. [Music] [Applause] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Church, we have an eternal [Music] visa. No country can stop this. government. No politics, no minister, every child. [Applause] [Applause] Hallelujah. Heat. Heat. [Music] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hosana. Hosana. Hosana. Hosana. Hosana. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Glory. Hallelujah. Satan is in trouble. The devil is in trouble. Church. [Applause] These giants had names and names have meanings. [Music] Tonight we are not guessing. [Music] We are not hoping to hit. These giants the Bible has a finite number, a specific number. So we know the giant called Goliath. We know what happened to him. He had to fall. You know the Bible says that Goliath had a brother. [Applause] Church when David killed Goliath, it made giant killing normal. You don't hear me [Applause] tonight. You don't hear me tonight. [Applause] [Music] in second Samuel 21 in verse 15. I'll just paraphrase. The Philistines at war again with Israel. [Music] And David went down and fought the Philistines. And the Bible said that David waxed feet. David was tired. I want you to picture right now of that day. David was the only minister that had ever killed a giant. When when David got saved, the Bible says that is another giant. [Applause] He thought he got a good idea. He tried to kill David. And on his way to kill David, another brother named Abishai without his sword and he felt inspired. Nobody told him to do it. He said, "Look, a giant and the Bible said, he killed that giant. David is resting." One of David's men, he took out the giant. If David could have spoken to us tonight, he would send us a message. Every giant must fall. Listen, it doesn't it doesn't stop there. That same scripture and it came to pass There was another battle and another brother killed S. He was another giant. These were the cousins of of Goliath. [Applause] Goliath was dead and all of his cousins were still trying to exist. David's mighty men, David's gentile warriors, they were not prepared to let one giant live. If it looked like a giant, if it walked like a giant, If it moved like a giant. If the bed was too big, if the house was too tall, you don't hear me. Can the church say amen? They had a revelation that every giant had to fall. [Music] [Applause] Hallelujah. Let me try to bring this home. The mystery mystery of Caleb between Abraham Abraham and David. Abraham Abraham bought the land of Hebron. King David would be crowned as king on Hebron. If Caleb did not expel the sons of Anoch from Hebron this story would not connect. Abraham bought it. Caleb leanth and David was crowned at the earth. Church, there is no crowning unless you deal with your child. I'm trying to find a place to close out. Brother Brandham said when Satan was in heaven, Satan knew some of the plans of God and Satan tried to interrupt God's program. God was always planning to make David [Music] king. Saul was never part of the [Music] plan was the devil's attempt to give the people a [Music] substitute. But in God's mind, the scripture in Matthew 1:1 was already written, son of Abraham, Abraham, son of David, and in there a mystery of a gentile, a type of us. If there was no gentile there, he would have never been part of the story. He was a gentile adopted adopted into Judah the royal tribe. You don't hear me this. [Applause] And then one day, this is what Easter proves, and I'm getting ready to close out. One day, the son of Abraham, the son of David, the great high priest, who was also a king. Never before was there somebody who had so many titles in the Old Testament. To be a king, you had to be in the tribe of Judah. To be a priest, you had to be in the tribe of Levi. But here came someone who could trace his genealogy. After Abraham, he could trace his genealogy. to David and his order was higher than the order of Aaron because he was of the order of Melazc. He was a priest. He was a king. He was a judge. He was a healer. He was a way maker. He was a miracle worker. [Applause] Listen church, I'm getting ready to close. By the time Jesus came, there were no more giants on the earth, could kill with a sword. But there were three giants that David couldn't deal with. [Music] Caleb couldn't do it. David's men couldn't do it. There was a giant called death. There was a giant called hell. There was a giant called the grave. And when Jesus came, he said, "Don't worry. I got this. I got this. I got this. Listen. Caleb expelled the three sons of Anoch. Jesus came and expelled death, hell and the grave. Jesus walked into hell on Saturday between Friday and Sunday. They were having a celebration. They thought he was dead. For Jesus, the great giant slayer knew that every giant must fall. Sickness must fall. Cancer must fall. Death must fall. The grain must fall. [Applause] Jesus must open the door, walk straight up to the devil. The security couldn't stop him. Those demons couldn't stop him. He took the keys, and he lifted up the keys. The mighty conqueror, the mighty conqueror. Every giant is already dead. No more giants. [Music] Finish. You are free. You are free. You are free. And who the son of man says free is free indeed. [Music] May the Lord bless you. [Applause] [Applause] [Music] Give him a shout of praise. Because you are free. You are free [Music] tonight. You can turn around and preach your brother and your sister. Hallelujah. One man of man is Jesus. Hallelujah. [Music] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. [Music] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
