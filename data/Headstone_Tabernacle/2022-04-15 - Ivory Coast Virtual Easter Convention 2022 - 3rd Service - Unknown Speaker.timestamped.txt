[33:11] we welcome him today amen so god bless
[33:13] you as he comes amen
[33:18] god bless you brothers and sisters
[33:22] today i would like to send you a
[33:24] greeting from germany
[33:26] and i would especially like to send my
[33:29] greetings to brother paul in abhijan
[33:31] from the ivory coast
[33:33] and i'm happy that we can have
[33:35] fellowship with each other like this
[33:40] i would like to
[33:42] call out to you with a few words of
[33:45] encouragement
[33:47] nothing new
[33:49] but i think it is so important
[33:53] keep going
[33:56] the road we still have to travel is
[33:59] certainly not far
[34:00] even if it becomes increasingly
[34:03] difficult we are looking up to heaven
[34:08] the political and economic situation
[34:11] here in europe is very frightening in
[34:14] the face of this terrible war
[34:18] but we know
[34:20] that god's judgment hanging over this
[34:23] world to judge the poor of babylon is
[34:27] being prepared
[34:29] we would like to escape from all these
[34:32] pressures and
[34:34] inconveniences
[34:36] but we know that there is only one way
[34:39] to get out of this dilemma
[34:42] and that is to go up
[34:44] in a
[34:46] rapture roman
[34:49] chapter 8 verse 22 to 25 contains the
[34:54] forces we all know well
[34:58] for we
[35:00] know
[35:01] that the whole
[35:03] creation growneth and travail it in pain
[35:07] together until now
[35:10] and not only they
[35:12] but ourselves also which have the first
[35:15] fruits of the spirit even we ourselves
[35:18] grown within ourselves
[35:21] waiting for the adoption to wit
[35:24] the redemption of our body
[35:28] for we are saved by hope
[35:30] but hope that is seen is not hope
[35:33] for what a man
[35:35] seeth
[35:37] why does he yet hope for
[35:39] but if we hope
[35:41] for that we see not then do we with
[35:45] patients wait for it
[35:50] paul says that not
[35:52] only they the creation
[35:54] groan
[35:56] but also we who have the first fruits of
[35:59] the spirit
[36:01] the people of that time were baptized
[36:04] with the holy spirit
[36:06] and yet they groaned
[36:09] even peter whose shadow was sufficient
[36:12] to heal the sick
[36:14] they did not obtain it
[36:16] because they had to wait until the
[36:19] fullness of the gentiles was called out
[36:25] that is
[36:26] why they waited for the adoption
[36:30] the redemption of their body
[36:32] and paul urges us to wait in patience
[36:37] but this is also very important to
[36:39] understand that jesus tells his
[36:41] disciples in luke 21 verse 28
[36:45] that there will be a time for us to lift
[36:48] up our heads because our redemption is
[36:52] drawing nigh
[36:56] this is the redemption of our bodies
[36:59] our souls are redeemed
[37:01] we are sons and daughters from the
[37:03] beginning
[37:05] attributes of god
[37:07] but there is a quality in the sons and
[37:10] daughters of god that shall become
[37:13] invisible
[37:14] at the end of time that will bring a
[37:17] great change
[37:21] the speaking of the word
[37:23] the fullness of the third pull and the
[37:25] transformation of our earthly body into
[37:29] a glorified body
[37:32] we have understood that these things can
[37:34] only come forth in fullness when the
[37:37] pressure on earth comes to a certain
[37:40] point
[37:42] and it is rapidly increasing due to a
[37:45] pandemic and war with international
[37:48] implications
[37:50] we can learn something from the great
[37:53] pentecost 2000 years ago
[37:56] pentecost 2000 years ago
[37:58] brought about such a tremendous change
[38:01] or innovation so that this earthly body
[38:05] had to obey the spirit of god and they
[38:08] begin began to speak in new tongues so
[38:12] that the gentiles could grasp the gospel
[38:16] for their heard the believers speaking
[38:19] in their own languages
[38:22] will not something similar happen again
[38:26] at the end of time
[38:29] that the gospel will be returned to the
[38:31] jews
[38:32] we think of the two witnesses moses and
[38:36] elijah
[38:37] and the saints will be called out of the
[38:40] tombs
[38:42] a bride ready
[38:44] to be the final voice in the final age
[38:49] it took the transformation of tongues
[38:52] to call the gentiles will there not also
[38:55] be a transformation of the bodies in
[38:58] calling those who have died in christ
[39:01] how wonderful brother branham has
[39:04] explained this great mystery to us
[39:12] jesus said say to this mountain
[39:16] you have heard about
[39:18] what's been taking place
[39:20] that's the ministry that we are entering
[39:23] into
[39:24] we are way up the road now
[39:27] soon the coming of the lord jesus and we
[39:30] have
[39:31] got to have rapturing faith in a church
[39:35] that can be changed in a moment in a
[39:37] twinkling of an eye
[39:39] and go out or will not go
[39:43] but don't worry it will be there
[39:47] it will be there and when the power of
[39:50] this church
[39:52] our church the bride in the end time
[39:55] rises it will bring its brethren
[39:59] the power of that church
[40:01] the overcomers from the church age
[40:03] before our age rises will bring its
[40:07] brethren
[40:08] the power of that church will bring the
[40:11] other brethren
[40:13] then there will be a general
[40:14] resurrection
[40:16] and we know at the end after the
[40:19] millennium
[40:20] there will be a white throne judgment
[40:24] and we are looking forward
[40:27] to it
[40:30] oh
[40:31] what a time we are entering now
[40:36] brother branham
[40:39] said
[40:46] his great glorious presence shall strike
[40:50] the earth
[40:51] he cometh in clouds
[40:54] oh i love that clouds
[40:56] there will be a wave
[40:59] after a wave
[41:01] of his glory
[41:03] will come across the earth and the
[41:05] resurrection of the saints shall come
[41:08] when that blessed holy spirit
[41:11] that lived in their hearts and they died
[41:14] with their corpse laying there and the
[41:17] deer stains over their cheeks and things
[41:20] like that
[41:22] and they are placed out here in the
[41:24] graveyard a great wave
[41:27] of
[41:28] that same spirit
[41:30] and
[41:31] a wash
[41:33] wave after wave
[41:36] he that was last will be first and he
[41:38] that was first will be last
[41:41] how can it be that way
[41:43] that's the order of the resurrection
[41:47] won't know
[41:49] nobody in the generation before me
[41:52] or the generation after me
[41:54] i'll know those in the generation of
[41:57] this
[41:58] and every generation will come
[42:00] successfully
[42:02] right as it went down they which were
[42:05] last will be first sure it has to be see
[42:09] i'll know my people
[42:11] the next fellow my dad will know his
[42:14] people his grandfather
[42:16] his people on down like that
[42:20] wave after wave after wave after wave
[42:24] and the saints

[52:29] amen
[52:35] greetings church in the name of the lord
[52:37] jesus christ you may be seated just for
[52:39] a short greeting
[52:46] so uh this morning again i'm standing on
[52:48] behalf of the pastor for the virtual
[52:50] convention
[52:52] for cote d'ivoire ivory coast
[52:54] hosted by pastor paul on jake
[52:58] jacob so just on behalf of the pastor
[53:02] etmb johannesburg south africa we just
[53:04] want to greet the virtual convention
[53:06] in the name of the lord jesus christ
[53:13] and then also just to acknowledge the
[53:15] ministers that will be preaching the
[53:16] ministers that will be greeting we want
[53:18] to thank god for them
[53:20] and appreciate each and every one that
[53:21] will be watching these meetings when
[53:23] it's streamed may the lord bless you
[53:26] grant your heart's desires
[53:30] now
[53:31] brother paul's
[53:33] theme of the convention i just want to
[53:34] read that
[53:35] before we go into the scripture reading
[53:39] the theme of the convention is the life
[53:41] of christ in you
[53:43] is the vindication of the rapture
[53:47] and his inspiration is the revelation by
[53:50] the life
[53:51] of christ
[53:53] and so my message today is purely on the
[53:55] revelation of jesus christ
[53:58] and i trust and believe that it will be
[54:00] a blessing
[54:01] why because i'm preaching from a
[54:02] vindicated word
[54:04] that the prophet of malachi 4 had
[54:06] already brought
[54:07] and i pray that it will be a blessing to
[54:09] you
[54:11] today and also to
[54:13] the
[54:14] audience that will be watching it
[54:15] afterwards
[54:17] when we stand to our feet
[54:20] just to invite you to the reading of the
[54:22] word
[54:26] i've got three portions of scripture
[54:29] first one is second corinthians 3 and
[54:32] we'll read from verses 18
[54:34] and if you want to keep the other one
[54:36] ephesians 3 9
[54:39] and in colossians 1 15
[54:42] and we'll read from there
[54:52] if you found it
[54:54] second corinthians 3 from verses 18
[54:57] it says but we all with open face
[54:59] beholding as in a glass the glory of the
[55:02] lord
[55:03] are changed into the same image from
[55:05] glory to glory
[55:07] even as by the spirit of the lord
[55:11] and then if we can go to
[55:13] ephesians 3 9.
[55:22] it says and to make all men see what is
[55:25] the fellowship of the mystery
[55:27] which from the beginning of the world
[55:29] hath been hid
[55:30] in god
[55:31] who created all things
[55:33] by jesus christ
[55:36] and then i want to go to verses 26 to 29
[55:40] it says that he would grant you
[55:42] according to the riches of his glory to
[55:44] be strengthened
[55:46] with might by his spirit in the inner
[55:48] man
[55:49] that christ may dwell in your hearts by
[55:52] faith
[55:53] that he being rooted and grounded in
[55:55] love
[55:55] may be able to comprehend with all sins
[55:58] what is the breath
[56:00] and length and depth and height
[56:04] and to know the love of christ which
[56:06] passeth
[56:07] knowledge
[56:08] that he might be filled with all the
[56:11] fullness of god
[56:12] now unto him that is able to do
[56:14] exceeding
[56:16] abundantly
[56:18] above all that we ask or think
[56:22] according to the power that worketh in
[56:24] us
[56:25] unto him be glory in the church by
[56:27] christ jesus throughout all ages
[56:31] world without end
[56:34] then the last one
[56:36] colossians 1 and we read from verses 15.
[56:48] who is the image of the invisible god
[56:52] the firstborn of every creature
[56:54] for by him were all things created
[56:57] that are in heaven
[56:58] and that are in earth
[57:00] visible and invisible whether they be
[57:03] thrones
[57:04] or dominions or principalities
[57:07] or powers
[57:09] all things were created by him and for
[57:12] him
[57:13] and he is before all things and by him
[57:15] all things consist
[57:18] my
[57:19] and he is the head of the body the
[57:21] church who is the beginning the
[57:23] firstborn from the dead that in all
[57:26] things
[57:27] he might have the preeminence
[57:29] for it please the father
[57:31] that in him should be all fullness
[57:35] dwell
[57:37] and then let's go to 26-29
[57:40] same chapter
[57:42] even the mystery which has been hit from
[57:44] ages and from generations but now is
[57:46] made manifest to his saints
[57:49] to whom god would make known
[57:51] what is the riches of the glory of this
[57:54] mystery
[57:55] among the gentiles
[57:57] which is
[57:58] christ in you the hope of glory
[58:01] whom we preach this is paul
[58:04] warning every man and teaching every man
[58:06] in all wisdom that we may present
[58:09] every man
[58:10] perfect in christ
[58:11] jesus
[58:12] where unto i also labor
[58:15] striving according to his working which
[58:18] worketh in me
[58:19] mightily may the lord add a blessing to
[58:22] the reading of his word you may be
[58:23] seated amen
[58:25] my the scripture is already anointed
[58:29] [Applause]
[58:36] amen
[58:40] i trust you're going to be preaching
[58:41] with me this morning
[58:45] and uh i'm going to do brother luke i
[58:47] can't do brother raymond because that's
[58:49] two big shoes
[58:50] to fill
[58:52] so church the title of the message is uh
[58:55] living images of the living god
[58:59] subject revelation and manifestation
[59:02] an inspiration messiah it's on the earth
[59:05] again
[59:09] now in a message christianity versus
[59:11] idolatry the prophet says this
[59:13] he says you and i are made partakers of
[59:16] his holiness
[59:17] why because we are made in his image
[59:20] the prophet says we are living images of
[59:23] the living god
[59:25] and he says now when he says the living
[59:27] god he says he's not talking about a
[59:28] mythical
[59:30] or an imaginary god some way but he's
[59:33] talking about a living god
[59:35] and then he turns around in that message
[59:36] he says what is a living god he says
[59:38] it's the word in you
[59:40] making itself real
[59:44] and so therefore it's a living god that
[59:46] is being made manifest in living
[59:48] tabernacles
[59:49] so you and i are the living tabernacles
[59:51] that the living god is making himself
[59:53] known
[59:54] at this end time
[59:57] now the prophet says now god according
[59:59] to john cena 1 1
[1:00:01] god was the word he says god is the word
[1:00:04] and if he is made manifest in you then
[1:00:06] it means that the word is made flesh
[1:00:09] again
[1:00:10] the very same way that the word was made
[1:00:12] flesh in him
[1:00:15] now looking at the inspiration of the
[1:00:16] convention
[1:00:18] i mean i just couldn't get away from
[1:00:20] this i mean this entire message is just
[1:00:23] built around christ
[1:00:25] is the mystery of god revealed
[1:00:29] and you know how the prophet breaks it
[1:00:31] down we talks about the threefold
[1:00:33] purpose of god the threefold unfolding
[1:00:36] of god
[1:00:36] and the threefold revelation of god
[1:00:39] and and you come to the realization that
[1:00:41] the bride is part of that unfolding
[1:00:44] why because you and i fulfill the second
[1:00:46] part
[1:00:47] of the threefold unfolding
[1:00:49] so you were part of the revelation of
[1:00:51] god himself
[1:00:53] for the purpose to bring back
[1:00:56] fallen eve he says to back to that
[1:00:59] hidden condition
[1:01:00] now if you look at the word revelation
[1:01:02] it says
[1:01:04] that it's a divine unfolding
[1:01:07] it's a disclosure
[1:01:09] it's an unfolding of himself or an
[1:01:12] unveiling
[1:01:14] of himself to you
[1:01:16] and that's a revelation
[1:01:18] now in christ is the mystery of god
[1:01:20] revealed he says now do you know that
[1:01:21] god is known
[1:01:22] by simplicity
[1:01:25] and of a revelation of jesus christ to
[1:01:27] the most illiterate person
[1:01:30] so in other words you get this
[1:01:32] revelation
[1:01:33] only by god
[1:01:34] you cannot get this revelation by your
[1:01:37] education not by your denomination not
[1:01:40] by being a good self or being a good
[1:01:42] moral christian he says he's christ is
[1:01:44] known
[1:01:46] only by a revelation of jesus christ
[1:01:49] and this is what we're going to base
[1:01:50] this entire message on
[1:01:53] my mind give the lord and praise for
[1:01:54] that
[1:01:54] [Applause]
[1:02:01] the prophet continues he says and by
[1:02:03] this revelation he's bringing his life
[1:02:06] to the body
[1:02:09] now he's the head the church is his body
[1:02:12] but by the revelation he brings his life
[1:02:15] to the body
[1:02:18] and for what he says in a vindication
[1:02:21] for the rapture
[1:02:23] and as we go along you'll see how it
[1:02:25] unfolds because all of this is the
[1:02:27] threefold purpose of god
[1:02:29] in matthew 16 18
[1:02:32] who do you say peter i am
[1:02:37] well some say you are elias
[1:02:41] some say you one of the prophets
[1:02:44] jesus christ zoned into him
[1:02:47] and he said i'm not interested in what
[1:02:49] the group says
[1:02:50] i'm not interested in what your church
[1:02:52] says i'm interested to hear what you say
[1:02:56] who do you say
[1:02:58] i the son of man am
[1:03:00] and what did peter turn around he said
[1:03:02] thou art the christ
[1:03:04] the son of the living god now peter
[1:03:07] flesh and blood has not revealed this to
[1:03:09] you flesh and blood can never reveal
[1:03:11] this to you only my father in heaven can
[1:03:15] reveal this mystery
[1:03:17] can reveal it to you
[1:03:19] [Applause]
[1:03:20] and on that revelation
[1:03:23] he builds his church
[1:03:25] not on peter not on the catechism not
[1:03:27] only denomination upon the revelation of
[1:03:31] who jesus christ is
[1:03:33] to the individual
[1:03:35] that is where he builds his church
[1:03:38] by the revelation
[1:03:40] and by the revelation he has his
[1:03:41] preeminence
[1:03:43] in the body
[1:03:44] my am i it's powerful
[1:03:49] now in a message christ is the mystery
[1:03:51] of god revealed the prophet says jesus
[1:03:54] said
[1:03:55] at that day
[1:03:57] will know then the prophet turns around
[1:03:59] and he says which day
[1:04:01] he says this day
[1:04:02] you will know it and then he says when
[1:04:04] the revelation
[1:04:06] is made known
[1:04:08] then you will know that i mean my father
[1:04:11] my father is in me
[1:04:13] i am in you
[1:04:14] when the revelation is made known
[1:04:17] then you will know
[1:04:20] my my mind let's give the lord and the
[1:04:21] priest
[1:04:23] caleb give me more volume
[1:04:30] [Applause]
[1:04:33] he continues he says when the revelation
[1:04:35] comes forth
[1:04:36] then it's in you and you in me
[1:04:39] he says now do you see the threefold
[1:04:41] purpose
[1:04:42] of god
[1:04:43] unfolding himself
[1:04:45] now
[1:04:47] all of hell
[1:04:48] is against this revelation
[1:04:51] all of hell is against this teaching he
[1:04:54] says all of hell is against this truth
[1:04:56] why because it exposes him
[1:04:59] it takes away your spiritual amnesia
[1:05:02] why because it shows you who you are
[1:05:05] it shows you what plan what what what uh
[1:05:08] position you play
[1:05:09] in this drama in this unfolding of god
[1:05:13] himself
[1:05:14] so all of hell is against it
[1:05:19] yes the prophet says but it's truth
[1:05:20] nonetheless
[1:05:23] and it's these divinely revealed mystery
[1:05:26] truths that will literally turn the
[1:05:29] hearts of the children
[1:05:31] back to the pentecostal fathers
[1:05:37] so peter on this rock
[1:05:39] of the revelation of who i am to you
[1:05:43] is where i will build my church
[1:05:45] now he says the gates of hell can not
[1:05:48] never will prevail
[1:05:50] against this revelation
[1:05:54] in exposition of the seven church ages
[1:05:56] now satan knows
[1:05:58] that if the people get the true
[1:06:00] revelation
[1:06:02] of the true church what she is
[1:06:05] and what she stands for
[1:06:07] that she can do the greater works the
[1:06:10] prophet says she will be an invincible
[1:06:12] army
[1:06:13] and that's the revelation that's the
[1:06:15] reason why christ him said the grace of
[1:06:17] el canned not prevail
[1:06:19] why because she becomes an invincible
[1:06:21] army because of the revelation of jesus
[1:06:23] christ
[1:06:25] now satan hates revelation
[1:06:27] the prophet says he hates it but you and
[1:06:30] i we love revelation
[1:06:32] [Applause]
[1:06:34] why because by the true revelation in
[1:06:36] our lives
[1:06:37] the gates of hell
[1:06:39] cannot prevail against it
[1:06:42] my my mind
[1:06:43] he continues and he says now what are
[1:06:45] you going to do
[1:06:46] when you get all that group together
[1:06:49] where the revelation is perfectly
[1:06:53] in harmony
[1:06:55] what are you going to do when that
[1:06:57] revelation becomes in harmony
[1:07:00] he says the church will know and she
[1:07:02] will realize the position
[1:07:05] if the church knew it
[1:07:08] then he says she will
[1:07:10] one day
[1:07:12] amen amen and give the lord and praise
[1:07:15] my my my mind
[1:07:19] i just want to get out i want to get it
[1:07:21] out
[1:07:23] now in matthew 11 25 the prophet says
[1:07:25] this what the scripture says
[1:07:27] now i thank you father
[1:07:30] lord of heavens and earth
[1:07:32] that you
[1:07:34] that heed these things
[1:07:36] from the eyes of the wise and the
[1:07:38] prudent
[1:07:39] and you have revealed it
[1:07:41] to the babes
[1:07:43] that will learn
[1:07:46] i thank you father
[1:07:48] that you have kept it for these
[1:07:50] who the prophet further down in another
[1:07:52] quote he says the sons of god then he
[1:07:55] turns around and he says we're the sons
[1:07:57] of god it's the same sons of god that he
[1:07:59] told job about where were you when the
[1:08:02] sons of god shouted for joy so when he
[1:08:04] comes and he reveals that mystery to you
[1:08:07] you are those sons of god that shouted
[1:08:09] for joy from before the foundation of
[1:08:11] the world
[1:08:12] amen
[1:08:14] why am i my mind so he's bringing that
[1:08:16] revelation to you why because you had
[1:08:19] representation
[1:08:20] before the foundation of the
[1:08:22] world amen
[1:08:25] who is this melchizedek
[1:08:28] the whole bible is the revelation of god
[1:08:30] the whole church is built upon the
[1:08:31] revelation of god there is no other way
[1:08:34] to know god only by revelation
[1:08:36] to whom the son will reveal him
[1:08:38] revelation everything is revelation and
[1:08:42] then he turns around and he says now not
[1:08:43] to accept revelation he says then all
[1:08:46] you are you are only a cold theologian
[1:08:49] and he says then there is no hope for
[1:08:51] you
[1:08:52] mine
[1:08:54] so
[1:08:55] in christ is the mystery of god reveal
[1:08:57] the prophet says that paul knew jesus
[1:09:00] by the revelation
[1:09:02] he says the very same way that peter
[1:09:04] knew empire revelation now paul did not
[1:09:07] meet him in the flesh even though they
[1:09:08] had lived in the same time period he
[1:09:12] he wasn't he didn't have the privilege
[1:09:13] of meeting him in the flesh
[1:09:15] he says but peter knew him in the flesh
[1:09:17] so in other words he knew him he was
[1:09:19] associated with him but peter also
[1:09:22] knew him
[1:09:23] by a revelation
[1:09:25] in other words really knew who this man
[1:09:27] was
[1:09:29] what was tabernacle behind that flesh
[1:09:32] and by that revelation he knew him
[1:09:36] now the prophet turns around again he
[1:09:38] says now you know that paul had
[1:09:39] something greater than any of these
[1:09:41] apostles
[1:09:42] now they could have turned around and
[1:09:43] said but paul we knew him
[1:09:45] we fished with him we walked with him we
[1:09:48] were with him on the campaign trail
[1:09:51] but paul saw him
[1:09:53] [Music]
[1:09:54] in in a different light he saw him in
[1:09:56] the way that the israelites saw
[1:10:00] it now
[1:10:03] he continuously says paul saw him after
[1:10:05] he was dead buried and rose why because
[1:10:07] he expressed himself
[1:10:09] to paul in the pull of fire when he said
[1:10:12] to him paul why are you persecuting me
[1:10:14] well who are you lord i am jesus
[1:10:19] and paul knew because he could identify
[1:10:21] within the polar fire this this
[1:10:23] this is what they knew the overwatch
[1:10:27] because that great pillar of fire is
[1:10:29] what led the children out of israel
[1:10:35] paul knew him as he was a burning a
[1:10:38] flame in the bush that had spoken to
[1:10:40] moses
[1:10:42] now the prophet says he proved to paul
[1:10:45] that he was the same yesterday today and
[1:10:47] forever in other words he was the god
[1:10:50] that the israelites knew he was god
[1:10:53] jehovah he was god jesus in the flesh
[1:10:57] and he turned back to god in the pillar
[1:10:58] of fire
[1:11:00] now the prophet says now can you imagine
[1:11:02] that revelation that peter had is that
[1:11:04] paul
[1:11:07] he said no wonder you could separate the
[1:11:08] law from grace
[1:11:11] because he got that perfect revelation
[1:11:13] straight from god
[1:11:15] now the prophet says in christ is the
[1:11:17] mystery and here he is today
[1:11:20] now remember he preached christ is the
[1:11:21] mystery in 6307
[1:11:23] and this was just after the seals he
[1:11:25] says yeah he is today in the same manner
[1:11:28] by the same pillar of fire expressing
[1:11:30] himself and vindicating himself the same
[1:11:34] he's revealing the mystery of god that's
[1:11:37] been hit since the foundation of the
[1:11:38] world
[1:11:40] that was the ministry of the son of man
[1:11:42] in a son of man
[1:11:45] my mama let's give the lord and praise
[1:11:54] now the holy ghost is the only revealer
[1:11:57] of this divine revelation of jesus
[1:11:59] christ
[1:12:01] and it will only reveal it to the
[1:12:02] predestinated seed
[1:12:05] all that the father has given me will
[1:12:08] come
[1:12:09] and no man
[1:12:11] will come except the father draws him
[1:12:15] so the revelation comes to the
[1:12:17] predestinated seed
[1:12:20] now let's look at the threefold
[1:12:21] revelation of god
[1:12:22] spoken word is the original seed the
[1:12:24] prophet says that god the father was god
[1:12:27] that lived in the pillar of fire
[1:12:30] god the father lived in the sun
[1:12:33] why because the sun was only an
[1:12:35] expression
[1:12:36] the sun was the expressed image of god
[1:12:39] he was the image of the unseen god
[1:12:42] expressed in the sun
[1:12:45] and now because of the sun's death
[1:12:47] burial and resurrection he comes now as
[1:12:49] the holy spirit to dwell in the church
[1:12:52] to fulfill exactly what he did
[1:12:55] and he fulfills and he lives his life
[1:12:57] through the bright body the very same
[1:12:59] way he did
[1:13:01] in the sun
[1:13:02] why because it's the same spirit that
[1:13:05] was in the sun
[1:13:06] give the lord a praise amen
[1:13:09] my my my mind
[1:13:14] so the threefold purpose
[1:13:17] god wanted to reveal himself
[1:13:20] he wanted to make himself known
[1:13:24] the prophet says he wanted to make
[1:13:25] himself material
[1:13:27] because god is the spirit
[1:13:30] now he says how could he do it
[1:13:32] being this great being
[1:13:36] being this
[1:13:38] fountain of eternity
[1:13:40] he says he covered all of space and
[1:13:42] eternity
[1:13:44] it would have been too mysterious
[1:13:47] how could he reveal himself to man
[1:13:50] by becoming man
[1:13:53] the prophet says and what did he do he
[1:13:54] manifested himself as son
[1:13:59] son of man
[1:14:02] and he says no wonder he kept saying
[1:14:04] that the son of man they must they
[1:14:06] didn't see it or in other words they
[1:14:08] didn't catch what he was saying
[1:14:11] now
[1:14:13] as the sun he could express himself
[1:14:16] now the unseen god can be touched
[1:14:24] and he come to now now this is the
[1:14:26] unfolding this is the revelation of
[1:14:28] jesus christ that was heat from before
[1:14:30] the foundation of the world
[1:14:33] now the second fold is he wants to have
[1:14:35] a preeminence
[1:14:37] in a body of believers
[1:14:40] the prophet says his bride
[1:14:43] he wants to live in people
[1:14:46] because that is the very purpose that
[1:14:48] man was created for
[1:14:50] in the first place
[1:14:52] before the fall man was created for the
[1:14:55] indwelling
[1:14:57] of jesus christ for the indwelling of
[1:15:00] god himself
[1:15:01] that he can work
[1:15:03] through them and in them to fulfill his
[1:15:06] purpose
[1:15:08] [Applause]
[1:15:11] now the prophet says for what purpose
[1:15:13] it's to bring her back
[1:15:15] to eden
[1:15:18] is to bring back fallen eve
[1:15:21] back to eden
[1:15:23] then he says now what is god's purpose
[1:15:25] in all of this because i can say
[1:15:28] why did he let adam and eve fall
[1:15:30] why didn't he just prevent that from
[1:15:33] happening
[1:15:34] the prophet says then he is the entire
[1:15:37] attribute would not have been made known
[1:15:41] in other words in him was to be a savior
[1:15:44] now in that message he says how could
[1:15:46] god
[1:15:47] be a savior he says only through christ
[1:15:50] in him wants to be his son how could god
[1:15:53] be the son he says only through christ
[1:15:56] in him was to be a healer how would he
[1:15:59] be a healer he says only through christ
[1:16:04] now we see that all things
[1:16:07] are wound up in that one person
[1:16:10] the lord jesus christ
[1:16:13] [Applause]
[1:16:15] can we see the unfolding
[1:16:18] do you understand this mystery
[1:16:20] do we understand the unfolding of the
[1:16:22] revelation of jesus christ
[1:16:25] let's move on amen
[1:16:28] my
[1:16:38] christ is the mystery of god revealed
[1:16:41] the prophet says this secret of mystery
[1:16:44] is now revealed
[1:16:47] what is revealed god is manifested
[1:16:50] he says god and man had become one
[1:16:53] the anointed man he says the christ
[1:16:56] what does christ mean
[1:16:59] it means the anointed one
[1:17:01] then the prophet asked he says the
[1:17:03] question what is anointed one what was
[1:17:04] he anointed with he says he was anointed
[1:17:06] with the fullness of the godhead bodily
[1:17:11] that made him christ
[1:17:12] the anointed one that made him the
[1:17:15] messiah
[1:17:16] he says and for what purpose was god
[1:17:18] manifested it was to show god
[1:17:21] to man
[1:17:23] now this secret
[1:17:25] of mystery
[1:17:27] is now revealed
[1:17:29] only the prophet of malachi 4 could say
[1:17:31] that
[1:17:32] what is a secret it is something that is
[1:17:34] known not known or seen what is a
[1:17:36] mystery it's something that is difficult
[1:17:39] or impossible to understand
[1:17:41] but the secret of this mystery is now
[1:17:44] revealed
[1:17:45] god and man
[1:17:47] has become one
[1:17:49] my my mind let's give the lord a praise
[1:17:51] for that
[1:17:52] god and man has become one
[1:17:55] amen
[1:17:56] [Applause]
[1:18:06] he is the head of the body
[1:18:09] and by his own spirit the prophet says
[1:18:12] the body will move
[1:18:16] he will have preeminence in his church
[1:18:19] he says why because that's his rightful
[1:18:21] position
[1:18:23] because he is the head of the body
[1:18:25] the body will move by the intelligence
[1:18:27] of the head
[1:18:28] and by the spirit
[1:18:30] and like we preached before the very
[1:18:31] same way that eve's body was quickened
[1:18:34] to life
[1:18:35] by the dynamics of
[1:18:37] of adam
[1:18:39] my
[1:18:40] invisible union of the bride of christ
[1:18:44] in saint john the first chapter
[1:18:47] in the beginning was the word and the
[1:18:49] word was with god and the word was god
[1:18:52] and the same was made flesh
[1:18:54] and dwelt among us
[1:18:56] christ was the living word
[1:18:59] oh he always was the word he still is
[1:19:02] the word he always will be the word
[1:19:05] he was only the manifestation of the
[1:19:08] attribute of god
[1:19:09] for he was the son of god
[1:19:12] the only begotten of the father
[1:19:15] now
[1:19:16] this is a beautiful quote and we've read
[1:19:19] it before but
[1:19:20] just listen to what the prophet says
[1:19:22] because this alone
[1:19:24] just encapsulates it
[1:19:25] it gives you your purpose why you are
[1:19:27] here
[1:19:28] now he says
[1:19:30] any son
[1:19:32] is the attribute of his father
[1:19:34] and just as you were in the genes of
[1:19:36] your father
[1:19:37] in the body of your father when he was a
[1:19:40] young boy
[1:19:41] you were in him
[1:19:44] yet he could not have fellowship with
[1:19:46] you
[1:19:47] now when you are in your father you
[1:19:49] don't know
[1:19:50] you don't have recollection
[1:19:52] but you are in him
[1:19:55] as an attribute
[1:19:57] now
[1:19:58] the only way he could have fellowship
[1:20:00] with you is by the
[1:20:01] wedding grounds of the mother
[1:20:04] and he says now
[1:20:06] you are brought forth into the earth
[1:20:09] and
[1:20:10] you become in the image of your father
[1:20:15] and then you can have fellowship with
[1:20:17] you
[1:20:18] and so when they look at the baby elixir
[1:20:22] why because he's an attribute of his
[1:20:24] father
[1:20:25] he's now made manifest
[1:20:26] now the father can
[1:20:28] fellowship with him
[1:20:31] now here's the beautiful part about it
[1:20:33] the prophet says
[1:20:35] so
[1:20:36] and so were you
[1:20:38] sons of god and daughters of god before
[1:20:42] they even was a moon
[1:20:44] stars or a molecule
[1:20:48] now just as i was in my father i don't
[1:20:50] have a recollection of that
[1:20:52] but yet i was there
[1:20:54] now so you are sons and daughters of god
[1:20:56] you were in him the way you in your
[1:20:59] earthly father
[1:21:00] he says even before there was a sun even
[1:21:03] before there was moon even before there
[1:21:05] was a molecule
[1:21:06] so in other words you were part of that
[1:21:08] logos that came out of the eternal
[1:21:10] fountain of life you were an attribute
[1:21:13] in him and when you are made manifest on
[1:21:15] the earth
[1:21:16] the prophet says that you
[1:21:18] and i want to read the quote he says
[1:21:22] you are sons and daughters of god for
[1:21:24] you are only the physical manifestation
[1:21:27] of the attributes that was in god at the
[1:21:31] beginning
[1:21:32] you now
[1:21:34] you standing here today
[1:21:36] are the physical
[1:21:39] manifestation
[1:21:40] of the attribute that was in god at the
[1:21:43] beginning
[1:21:45] so in other words i was in him when he
[1:21:47] stood on the invisible platform
[1:21:49] and he said let there be light
[1:21:51] and there was light
[1:21:53] so i was in him
[1:21:55] i was an attribute in him and when i
[1:21:57] come into my designated decreed season
[1:22:00] now i become a manifestation
[1:22:02] of that attribute that was in the father
[1:22:05] that was in him
[1:22:07] way before the foundation of the world
[1:22:09] even before there was a molecule even
[1:22:11] before there was a moon even before
[1:22:13] there was in what was was the sun
[1:22:16] why am i
[1:22:18] catch the revelation
[1:22:21] know who you are
[1:22:27] let's get lord in the praise amen
[1:22:42] he says you don't know nothing about it
[1:22:44] neither did you know when he was in your
[1:22:45] earthly father he says but you are
[1:22:47] manifested in his image
[1:22:50] in the image of god you are made
[1:22:53] and you were manifested
[1:22:55] for the glory and for the fellowship of
[1:22:58] god
[1:23:00] the very same way that you were
[1:23:02] manifested because your father earthly
[1:23:04] wanted to have fellowship with you he
[1:23:06] wanted to know you because you were an
[1:23:07] attribute in him and he says for that
[1:23:10] very same purpose he says you were
[1:23:12] manifested for the glory and for the
[1:23:14] fellowship
[1:23:15] of god
[1:23:17] it's beautiful
[1:23:21] he says and therefore as sure as your
[1:23:23] gene had to be in your father
[1:23:25] before your natural birth
[1:23:27] your spiritual gene had to be in god
[1:23:30] because you're an expression
[1:23:32] of the attribute of his thoughts
[1:23:36] before the foundation of the world no
[1:23:38] way around it
[1:23:39] that's right he says now we notice then
[1:23:42] that life being in you it's god's life
[1:23:45] being in you from the foundation of the
[1:23:48] world
[1:23:48] so what does that make you a living
[1:23:51] image
[1:23:52] of the living god
[1:23:54] let's give the lord a praise
[1:23:59] my my
[1:24:03] now we come to nicodemus
[1:24:05] saint john 3.
[1:24:09] he knew that jesus knew something about
[1:24:11] life the prophet says
[1:24:14] and he wanted to inquire
[1:24:18] and the scripture says that except a man
[1:24:20] is born again
[1:24:22] the prophet says born of water and of
[1:24:23] spirit you cannot see the kingdom of god
[1:24:26] and the scripture continues and says
[1:24:28] that which is born of the flesh is flesh
[1:24:31] and that which is born of spirit is
[1:24:33] spirit
[1:24:34] now he says nicodemus knew
[1:24:38] that he knew something about life
[1:24:41] he says he just didn't know that he
[1:24:42] himself was eternal life
[1:24:47] that's why the scripture says the light
[1:24:49] shineth in darkness
[1:24:51] and the darkness comprehended is not
[1:24:55] he came to his own and his own received
[1:24:57] him not
[1:24:58] the prophet continues he says you know
[1:25:00] why because they were living in the
[1:25:01] glare of a previous age
[1:25:03] they were too invested in the washing of
[1:25:05] pots and pans
[1:25:07] and failed to see that god
[1:25:09] was manifested in the flesh
[1:25:15] now
[1:25:16] let's look at the natural
[1:25:19] and this is in why i'm against organized
[1:25:21] religion
[1:25:22] he says for you and i to have natural
[1:25:24] life the life that we now live
[1:25:28] he says for you to be become active
[1:25:31] in natural life
[1:25:33] it required a natural birth
[1:25:36] so in other words what did the natural
[1:25:38] birth do for you it puts you into five
[1:25:41] senses
[1:25:42] that's what the natural birth done for
[1:25:44] you
[1:25:45] so now you become active in this world
[1:25:48] now you can walk you can talk
[1:25:50] you can feel you can taste you can smell
[1:25:53] but that's all that the natural birth
[1:25:54] does for you
[1:26:00] and what that only makes you it only
[1:26:02] makes you a human being
[1:26:04] it only makes you a mortal
[1:26:06] man you are born to die
[1:26:10] now
[1:26:13] the prophet says that that first birth
[1:26:16] made me active
[1:26:18] and job turns around and he tells you
[1:26:20] but that man
[1:26:22] that is born of a woman
[1:26:24] is of a few days
[1:26:27] and he is full of trouble
[1:26:30] but
[1:26:31] the man that is born of christ
[1:26:34] is eternal
[1:26:40] then he says
[1:26:41] if that man that now that man that is
[1:26:43] born of christ
[1:26:44] is born from above
[1:26:48] now if you had to look at those two
[1:26:50] births which one would be more important
[1:26:52] to you
[1:26:59] why because the natural birth only made
[1:27:01] me
[1:27:01] active in this world
[1:27:04] but
[1:27:05] to be born from above
[1:27:07] will make me active
[1:27:09] in the things
[1:27:11] above
[1:27:12] now listen how the prophet puts it
[1:27:15] [Applause]
[1:27:21] he says now it is for himself to act in
[1:27:25] his word through you
[1:27:27] he says that's the reason why he said
[1:27:28] that i am the vine
[1:27:30] you are the branches
[1:27:32] in other words if you are born from
[1:27:34] above he can throw his own life into the
[1:27:36] branch
[1:27:37] why because the vine doesn't bear the
[1:27:39] fruit
[1:27:40] the branch is what bears the fruit so
[1:27:42] the branch bears the fruit by the life
[1:27:45] of the vine
[1:27:46] and that is makes you active
[1:27:49] in the things from above
[1:27:51] why because now you are born
[1:27:53] from above
[1:27:59] he says that's the reason jesus said if
[1:28:01] i do not the works of my father believe
[1:28:03] me not
[1:28:06] why because he came to fulfill the life
[1:28:09] of the father through that earth that
[1:28:12] body that was man created man
[1:28:15] now nicodemus was still confounded
[1:28:19] why because jesus said to him no man has
[1:28:21] ascended up to heaven but ye that came
[1:28:23] down from heaven
[1:28:25] he says he should have seen it in other
[1:28:27] words he was almost there he almost got
[1:28:29] the revelation but he just didn't get it
[1:28:34] he says why because he ought to have
[1:28:36] seen that that is god
[1:28:39] this isn't why i'm against organized
[1:28:40] religion
[1:28:42] but he failed to see it he was there he
[1:28:45] was almost there
[1:28:46] he says but he failed to see that that
[1:28:49] is god
[1:28:53] now in the message the seed is not here
[1:28:55] with the shaq
[1:28:56] we know at this age that we are living
[1:28:59] in
[1:29:00] that the word is to be born into a
[1:29:02] manifestation
[1:29:04] in the last days
[1:29:05] in other words we know that the message
[1:29:07] of the hour was the full restoration of
[1:29:09] the word
[1:29:10] and when the restoration of the word
[1:29:12] came it came with the restoration of the
[1:29:13] power
[1:29:15] now in seed is not here with the shock
[1:29:17] he says now notice
[1:29:19] but at the opening of the seven seals
[1:29:21] revelation 10 the full word is to be
[1:29:23] born
[1:29:24] into manifestation again
[1:29:27] and vindicated by the same spirit of god
[1:29:30] in the full strength as it was when he
[1:29:32] was here on earth
[1:29:34] [Music]
[1:29:37] it was to be manifested he says in the
[1:29:39] same way doing the same things
[1:29:42] then it would that it did when he was
[1:29:44] here on earth then the prophet says
[1:29:46] hebrews 13 8 jesus christ the same
[1:29:48] yesterday to reign forever
[1:29:51] now
[1:29:52] the spirit
[1:29:53] that comes upon the promised word for
[1:29:55] this age
[1:29:58] it brings forth and it manifests
[1:30:01] not two tablets of stone the way he did
[1:30:02] in moses's age he says but it manifests
[1:30:05] the presence of the living god
[1:30:08] now what was that that was a
[1:30:09] manifestation of luke 17 30 why because
[1:30:12] god himself prophesied
[1:30:14] and he said in that day
[1:30:16] when the son of man is to be revealed
[1:30:18] again
[1:30:20] and that day is this day
[1:30:22] this is this age that we are living in
[1:30:24] now the prophet says that that was a
[1:30:26] manifestation of the son of man again in
[1:30:29] our midst so in other words the very
[1:30:31] same way that he manifested himself
[1:30:33] in the flesh of jesus christ
[1:30:35] he stepped behind another flesh
[1:30:38] of malachi 4 and he manifested the son
[1:30:41] of man
[1:30:44] then he needed the rising of the sun
[1:30:45] then ask yourself
[1:30:48] who opened the seals then what was the
[1:30:50] opening of the seals
[1:30:52] it was revealing christ
[1:30:54] why because that's the purpose that
[1:30:56] malachi 4 came for to reveal christ that
[1:30:59] was the reason for the opening of the
[1:31:01] seals
[1:31:02] why because
[1:31:04] he is those seals
[1:31:08] he's the one that opened those seals
[1:31:10] [Applause]
[1:31:12] christ is the seals that was opened
[1:31:15] to you and i thank you
[1:31:17] my my let's give the lord and the priest
[1:31:25] i love this quote in the guide also he
[1:31:26] says now at the finishing of the seventh
[1:31:28] seal the mystery of god
[1:31:31] should be finished
[1:31:34] at the finishing of the seventh seal
[1:31:36] the mystery of god is finished
[1:31:38] and when it's finished then he says in
[1:31:40] the guide then it we see it and we know
[1:31:44] who god is
[1:31:46] he says we know what he is we know how
[1:31:48] he lives
[1:31:50] we know his nature he says he is being
[1:31:52] and when all of that comes he says we
[1:31:55] are all the way up here to the top of
[1:31:56] the purim why because now he's formed us
[1:31:59] into the full statue of sons and
[1:32:01] daughters of god
[1:32:02] and all that is left is he comes down
[1:32:04] and he caps the pyramids of our lives
[1:32:07] why because that makes you then the
[1:32:09] living image
[1:32:11] of the living god
[1:32:12] on earth in this last day and age
[1:32:15] my my mind let's give the lord a praise
[1:32:17] amen
[1:32:20] i'm almost there i think we're going
[1:32:21] well
[1:32:24] [Applause]
[1:32:26] [Music]
[1:32:26] [Applause]
[1:32:30] spoken word is the original seed these
[1:32:32] last days the troop church pride comes
[1:32:34] to the headstone
[1:32:36] what will that make it will make a
[1:32:37] superchurch
[1:32:39] a super race
[1:32:40] as she nears the headstone
[1:32:42] they will be so much like him even they
[1:32:45] will be in his very
[1:32:47] image
[1:32:49] in order to unite her him with the bride
[1:32:52] they will be one they will be the very
[1:32:55] manifestation of the word of the living
[1:32:58] god the prophet says your denomination
[1:33:00] will never be able to produce this
[1:33:03] your denomination will only produce
[1:33:04] creeds and dogmas
[1:33:07] but the revelation of jesus christ
[1:33:10] makes you into the image
[1:33:12] of god the father
[1:33:14] my my
[1:33:16] statue of a perfect man what christ was
[1:33:19] these people are because his life is in
[1:33:21] here
[1:33:22] he says they are in christ and their
[1:33:24] life is dead and hidden christ through
[1:33:26] god sealed in there by the holy ghost
[1:33:29] first corinthians 12 that's right he
[1:33:31] says you reckon yourself dead then
[1:33:33] you're born of faith then virtue and
[1:33:36] these other things is added to you tell
[1:33:39] you a perfect living image of god
[1:33:44] the prophet says that's wonderful
[1:33:46] and the congregation says
[1:33:50] amen
[1:33:53] that's how he forms you into the loving
[1:33:55] image
[1:33:56] of the living god
[1:33:59] my my mind
[1:34:00] and then god through that as brought
[1:34:02] also seven church ages to show the seven
[1:34:05] steps that he brought building his
[1:34:07] individual into his image he's built a
[1:34:09] complete church in his image and at the
[1:34:12] resurrection his complete body will be
[1:34:14] raised up to live with him forever why
[1:34:16] because it is
[1:34:18] a bride
[1:34:20] his presence in the individual with a
[1:34:22] personal vindication of himself
[1:34:24] expressing himself in the living word
[1:34:27] that's promised for the day expressing
[1:34:29] itself through you he says a vindication
[1:34:32] of the great revelation of god
[1:34:35] now he says now look
[1:34:36] it was only an individual and never in a
[1:34:39] group
[1:34:41] so so then we can turn around like the
[1:34:42] prophet said in invisible union oh that
[1:34:45] spiritual union
[1:34:47] of christ and his church
[1:34:49] he says when flesh is becoming word
[1:34:51] and word is becoming flesh
[1:34:54] why to be manifested and vindicated
[1:34:57] he says and we near the coming of jesus
[1:35:00] he says when he's united with his church
[1:35:02] he says when the word becomes the word
[1:35:05] why because she is him
[1:35:08] because she was taken from the bosom of
[1:35:10] the word that makes her word
[1:35:13] she is him
[1:35:14] now the prophet says we near the coming
[1:35:16] of jesus
[1:35:17] where he's united with his church
[1:35:20] my my my let's give the lord and the
[1:35:21] praise amen
[1:35:24] i just want to see where i'm at
[1:35:35] now in a message the messiah
[1:35:37] the prophet speaks about he says the
[1:35:39] word of god is a conductor
[1:35:42] he says in the word of god he's a
[1:35:43] conductor to use the power
[1:35:46] the dynamics
[1:35:48] and he sent his word as a gift
[1:35:50] to you and i
[1:35:52] in other words he sent the conductor
[1:35:53] that will be able to conduct the power
[1:35:55] that you will be sending
[1:35:57] now if you look at a conductor he says
[1:35:59] what is a conductor it's a substance in
[1:36:02] which an electrical charge
[1:36:04] is carried
[1:36:06] in other words conductivity in general
[1:36:09] is the capacity to transmit something
[1:36:12] such as electricity or heat
[1:36:15] so if the word is the conductor of the
[1:36:17] power
[1:36:19] then we need to get the word in us
[1:36:21] because when he sends the power he is
[1:36:23] sending it on his word
[1:36:25] in other words that's the reason why
[1:36:26] we're feeding on
[1:36:28] son of man's seed
[1:36:30] so that when he sends the promise of his
[1:36:32] father
[1:36:33] we'll be able to conduct that power
[1:36:36] free flow through you as the individual
[1:36:40] now the prophet says outside of that
[1:36:42] word being in you you are lost
[1:36:45] that's the reason why he said
[1:36:47] if he abide in me and my word abide in
[1:36:50] you
[1:36:51] then you will ask what you will
[1:36:54] why because you and the word have become
[1:36:56] the same you become one
[1:36:58] and he turns around in christ is the
[1:36:59] mystery he says and by that he has the
[1:37:01] preeminence
[1:37:03] in his bright body
[1:37:04] then like paul you become a prisoner
[1:37:07] he says and why because you are so yoked
[1:37:09] to christ
[1:37:13] [Applause]
[1:37:14] and then you would also be able to say
[1:37:16] like he said i do only that which
[1:37:18] pleases my father
[1:37:22] then you can say like saint john 5
[1:37:25] 19
[1:37:27] i do only what the father shows me
[1:37:30] and that scripture continues and it says
[1:37:32] the father loveth the son and he share
[1:37:34] with him all things that himself doeth
[1:37:37] and he will show him greater works
[1:37:40] than these
[1:37:41] why because the word is in the bride
[1:37:44] and the mind of christ
[1:37:46] and she knows what he once done
[1:37:48] with the word
[1:37:52] now listen to this quote in the messiah
[1:37:55] he says a conduct is a wire that
[1:37:56] conducts
[1:37:58] and let a man with that same faith in
[1:38:00] the conductor of the word of god he says
[1:38:03] he can raise the dead
[1:38:05] [Music]
[1:38:06] he cleanses the lepers
[1:38:08] he casts out devils
[1:38:10] he says amen he's fashioned like a god
[1:38:15] why because he's in the image he's made
[1:38:17] in the image of his father
[1:38:19] then he says he looks like god
[1:38:22] sure was
[1:38:23] that's the reason god was man
[1:38:25] man was god
[1:38:28] and this is his offspring
[1:38:30] then he says man
[1:38:32] man is his offspring
[1:38:34] he says he's only trying to get a hold
[1:38:36] of man he's trying to get man into his
[1:38:39] hands
[1:38:41] that he might walk with that he may work
[1:38:42] through man
[1:38:44] to fulfill his purpose
[1:38:47] amen that's dominion yes
[1:38:51] now the message the messiah
[1:38:54] man is made up of 16 elements
[1:38:58] and we know that man is also made up of
[1:38:59] cosmic light
[1:39:01] the prophet in that message he says now
[1:39:05] if we can only get to a place
[1:39:08] where we can push the cosmic light to
[1:39:10] the side
[1:39:12] because your body is meant is cosmic
[1:39:14] light he says if we can only get to a
[1:39:16] place where we can push cosmic light to
[1:39:18] the side he says and get the eternal
[1:39:20] light to come in
[1:39:21] he says then you have god in a man
[1:39:23] [Applause]
[1:39:24] my
[1:39:32] he says then god can dwell supremely
[1:39:35] he says he can do our thinking
[1:39:37] then he can do our walking
[1:39:39] then he can do our talking why because
[1:39:41] it's no longer man but it's god in the
[1:39:43] man
[1:39:46] in other words it's no longer deity in
[1:39:48] heaven it's deity in you
[1:39:52] so all we want to get to is we want to
[1:39:53] just push the cosmic light of this
[1:39:55] earthly body just push it a little bit
[1:39:58] to the side so we can get that eternal
[1:40:00] light
[1:40:01] to come in and what do you have you have
[1:40:04] god
[1:40:05] in the
[1:40:06] man that's the image of the living god
[1:40:11] [Applause]
[1:40:17] my my
[1:40:19] [Applause]
[1:40:24] in messiah
[1:40:25] but the kingdom of god is established in
[1:40:27] the heart and the soul of a man by
[1:40:30] a revelation of jesus christ
[1:40:33] he says and to have that revelation he
[1:40:36] says you become a believer
[1:40:39] and you believe that these signs
[1:40:42] will follow them that believe
[1:40:45] then he says do you see what messiah is
[1:40:49] he says messiah is the kingdom of god
[1:40:52] what is that he says you you become an
[1:40:54] anointed one why because he was anointed
[1:40:57] with the fullness of god
[1:40:58] that made him the messiah
[1:41:02] now if you are anointed with that same
[1:41:04] spirit
[1:41:05] what does that make you
[1:41:07] a messiah
[1:41:10] why because you are anointed with that
[1:41:12] same spirit that that body was anointed
[1:41:14] with
[1:41:16] then he says any church that's anointed
[1:41:19] with that same holy spirit is a messiah
[1:41:22] a little smaller god
[1:41:24] and someday when this body is
[1:41:27] resurrected i hope beforehand that god
[1:41:29] can get a hold
[1:41:31] of a bunch of people
[1:41:33] that will manif manifest his power
[1:41:36] listen to what he says in every
[1:41:38] dimension that it's supposed to be in
[1:41:42] [Applause]
[1:41:44] in every dimension that it's supposed to
[1:41:46] be in
[1:41:48] now when he gave peter the keys he said
[1:41:49] to peter whatever you
[1:41:52] die on earth
[1:41:54] will be tied in heaven whatever you lose
[1:41:57] or bind
[1:41:58] whatever you lose i will lose it
[1:42:01] what did he do with william branham
[1:42:03] william branham you speak to the storm
[1:42:06] and when you speak on the earth
[1:42:09] heaven will agree and nature will obey
[1:42:13] that's what it is
[1:42:14] because it's a manifestation in all the
[1:42:16] dimensions
[1:42:17] that it's supposed to be in
[1:42:19] william branham what do you need you're
[1:42:21] looking for squirrels speak it
[1:42:24] heaven will agree
[1:42:25] and nature
[1:42:27] will obey
[1:42:29] my mind
[1:42:31] why because it's the messiah
[1:42:34] it's the anointed one that's in a bright
[1:42:36] body manifesting himself the way he
[1:42:40] manifested himself in that body
[1:42:43] two thousand years ago
[1:42:45] you speak
[1:42:47] heaven agrees nature obeys
[1:42:50] let's give the lord a praise
[1:42:54] my my my
[1:43:08] [Music]
[1:43:10] [Applause]
[1:43:15] amen
[1:43:18] [Music]
[1:43:23] [Applause]
[1:43:25] now in this last days we know that the
[1:43:27] son of man is to be revealed again
[1:43:32] then in a message christ is the mystery
[1:43:33] of god revealed the prophet says this
[1:43:36] now he says that's the reason when this
[1:43:38] man sitting here dropped dead the other
[1:43:40] day
[1:43:42] now in that message there's someone that
[1:43:43] was sitting in the audience
[1:43:45] that had dropped dead maybe a couple of
[1:43:47] days before the prophet says
[1:43:49] and and the prophet prayed for him and
[1:43:50] called him back to life
[1:43:52] now listen how he says it in that
[1:43:54] message
[1:43:55] he says that's the reason when this man
[1:43:57] sitting here dropped dead the other day
[1:44:00] and he's sitting here now
[1:44:03] he says prophet says we could say
[1:44:05] come back life
[1:44:08] now the prophet was able to identify in
[1:44:11] himself the very same way and he says
[1:44:14] how close was jesus and the father
[1:44:17] he says the father was the very spirit
[1:44:19] and the life in him
[1:44:21] now willem branham could identify
[1:44:23] himself when he said we
[1:44:25] he says why because the holy spirit said
[1:44:27] so
[1:44:28] but the holy spirit spoke through him
[1:44:30] when he said life
[1:44:32] come back
[1:44:33] and he says here's this man sitting here
[1:44:35] today
[1:44:37] and this is when he preached christ is
[1:44:39] the mystery of god revealed
[1:44:42] then the prophet says now it's not them
[1:44:44] people
[1:44:46] he says it's the headshot in the body
[1:44:47] that has become one
[1:44:49] why this was the worst first wave shift
[1:44:51] he was manifesting the oneness
[1:44:56] and he says it is god that is making
[1:44:58] himself manifest in his people
[1:45:01] he says it's the anointed body of christ
[1:45:03] for what purpose it's to prove and to
[1:45:06] manifest god
[1:45:07] in that like it did in that body now
[1:45:10] he's referring to the body of jesus
[1:45:12] christ
[1:45:13] then he says that body is what redeemed
[1:45:15] these bodies
[1:45:16] and by that redemption he can have the
[1:45:18] preeminence
[1:45:20] and he can work through you the very
[1:45:22] same way he could work
[1:45:24] through that body over 2000 years ago
[1:45:27] and he says for what purpose it's to
[1:45:29] bring them back to the kingdom
[1:45:31] is to bring fallen eve back to an even
[1:45:33] condition
[1:45:35] and that's his threefold purpose
[1:45:37] that's the mystery of god revealed
[1:45:41] my
[1:45:49] [Applause]
[1:45:52] now let's get to saint luke 24.
[1:45:56] saint luke 24 this is the day of the
[1:45:58] resurrection
[1:46:01] we come upon a scene
[1:46:04] and we look at
[1:46:07] two believers
[1:46:09] the one's name is cleopas the other one
[1:46:11] is let's pull this one yes
[1:46:13] the other and and so it's cleopas
[1:46:22] and his friend
[1:46:25] in a message when the eyes were opened
[1:46:27] these two were walking
[1:46:30] and he says their hearts was heavy
[1:46:33] they were sad
[1:46:34] they were despondent
[1:46:37] why because jesus of nazareth
[1:46:41] was crucified
[1:46:43] he had died and they laid his body in
[1:46:45] the tomb
[1:46:50] now
[1:46:52] they had a different impression of what
[1:46:54] he was to do
[1:46:56] why because he was to come and restore
[1:46:58] the kingdom of israel
[1:47:02] and in their despondent state
[1:47:06] walking on the road to emmaus
[1:47:08] from jerusalem
[1:47:11] jesus himself drew nigh
[1:47:16] and said to them why are you so sad
[1:47:19] why are you so despondent
[1:47:22] [Applause]
[1:47:25] they turn around to him and say but are
[1:47:27] you a stranger in jerusalem
[1:47:29] don't you know what had happened in
[1:47:31] these last couple of days
[1:47:34] and they tell him about jesus
[1:47:36] now their eyes were failed
[1:47:40] now the prophet says
[1:47:42] hey
[1:47:44] jesus
[1:47:46] wants to preach the mystery of himself
[1:47:49] to them
[1:47:52] on the road to ebayers and he says why
[1:47:54] because they loved him
[1:47:55] they were one of his followers
[1:47:58] and the prophet in why in their eyes
[1:48:00] open he says the very same way that many
[1:48:02] of us people today he says we love him
[1:48:04] so much but we don't recognize him
[1:48:07] we don't know that he's alive
[1:48:10] we worship him as a
[1:48:12] historical god
[1:48:13] he says we worship him in our creeds
[1:48:16] but he's alive
[1:48:18] you're walking on the road emails being
[1:48:20] despondent don't you know he's alive
[1:48:24] don't you know for this purpose he came
[1:48:25] into the world
[1:48:26] [Applause]
[1:48:27] [Music]
[1:48:29] and this is what he was preaching to
[1:48:31] them
[1:48:34] the scripture says that he opened up
[1:48:37] the scriptures to them and he preached
[1:48:40] all of the scriptures from moses from
[1:48:43] genesis up until their time to show
[1:48:46] himself
[1:48:47] in scripture
[1:48:52] and he says it was pertaining to himself
[1:48:55] and
[1:48:56] at the cool of the evening in other
[1:48:58] words when evening it said
[1:49:00] [Music]
[1:49:01] he made us if he was going to pass by
[1:49:05] now the best thing that they could have
[1:49:08] ever done in their lives
[1:49:10] was to invite jesus
[1:49:12] in other words
[1:49:14] abide with us
[1:49:16] because when they said abide with us
[1:49:19] they were going to see the manifestation
[1:49:20] of the resurrection
[1:49:22] why the prophet says because on the road
[1:49:24] he only preached
[1:49:26] the resurrection
[1:49:28] but in the evening time
[1:49:30] he was to manifest
[1:49:32] the resurrection
[1:49:34] [Music]
[1:49:35] how
[1:49:36] by the breaking of the bread
[1:49:38] by the opening of the word
[1:49:40] by manifesting the resurrection
[1:49:42] [Applause]
[1:49:45] and the scripture says jesus blessed the
[1:49:47] bread
[1:49:48] and when he had broken it
[1:49:50] their eyes went open
[1:49:52] and they knew him
[1:49:55] the eyes went open what was it it was
[1:49:57] the opening of the word
[1:50:01] and by the opening of the word their
[1:50:03] eyes went open and they knew him
[1:50:05] [Music]
[1:50:05] [Applause]
[1:50:07] this is jesus
[1:50:09] this is the same jesus that we knew
[1:50:13] a couple of days we know that he died
[1:50:15] all of heaven had declared that he was
[1:50:18] dead
[1:50:19] but he's alive
[1:50:21] [Music]
[1:50:22] [Applause]
[1:50:27] now if you listen to the account of luke
[1:50:29] 24
[1:50:31] he disappeared
[1:50:33] after that
[1:50:34] that very same night
[1:50:36] it took them six hours to walk from
[1:50:37] jerusalem to emmaus
[1:50:40] and prophet says jesus preached the six
[1:50:42] hour sermon to them
[1:50:46] that very same night they were back
[1:50:48] ran back to jerusalem what to
[1:50:50] testify to the 11
[1:50:53] in the house that indeed
[1:50:56] he is alive
[1:50:57] and he is risen
[1:50:59] from the dead
[1:51:00] they had a perfect revelation
[1:51:03] of who he was of who he is
[1:51:07] as they testifying to the eleven
[1:51:10] jesus himself appears
[1:51:13] in their midst
[1:51:15] and says to them peace be unto you
[1:51:19] some that were sitting there that night
[1:51:20] thought they seeing a ghost
[1:51:22] [Music]
[1:51:24] he said behold i'm not a ghost
[1:51:27] a ghost doesn't have flesh and blood
[1:51:29] i mean in other words flesh and bone
[1:51:33] that very same glorified body
[1:51:35] asked for something to eat
[1:51:38] showing
[1:51:39] god himself in other words that same
[1:51:41] body
[1:51:42] that was dead
[1:51:44] the dynamics power that came back into
[1:51:46] it made that body live again made it
[1:51:48] real
[1:51:49] but made it a glorified body that can
[1:51:51] disappear
[1:51:53] appear and disappear and still be able
[1:51:54] to eat
[1:51:56] they gave him a piece of broiled fish
[1:52:00] now again if you understand the mystery
[1:52:06] some of them that was sitting there had
[1:52:08] a perfect revelation of who jesus christ
[1:52:10] was
[1:52:11] peter is an example
[1:52:13] but there was some there that was
[1:52:14] elected seed but still needed to
[1:52:16] understand it
[1:52:17] still needed to catch the revelation now
[1:52:19] luke 24 45 that same
[1:52:24] chapter
[1:52:25] says and then
[1:52:26] jesus
[1:52:28] opened up their understanding
[1:52:32] to the scriptures
[1:52:34] in other words jesus christ in that
[1:52:35] glorified body preached to them again
[1:52:38] and opened up the scriptures to them why
[1:52:40] because they needed to catch the
[1:52:41] revelation understand this is god
[1:52:43] unfolding himself this is all of this
[1:52:46] jesus christ coming in the flesh dying
[1:52:48] he's going to be ascending back into
[1:52:50] heaven why because he's going to be
[1:52:51] sending
[1:52:52] the promise of my father
[1:52:54] but some of you still need to catch the
[1:52:56] revelation so he's going to open up the
[1:52:58] scripture to you so that you can catch
[1:53:00] the revelation of who he is
[1:53:02] why because in a couple of days from
[1:53:04] that
[1:53:05] i will be sending the promise of my
[1:53:07] father
[1:53:08] so terry in jerusalem until i send
[1:53:12] the power from on high
[1:53:14] and that was the purpose why he preached
[1:53:16] to them
[1:53:17] the revelation and opened up the
[1:53:20] scriptures to them
[1:53:22] my my we're almost there
[1:53:26] in when the eyes were opened they knew
[1:53:27] him
[1:53:29] everything that pertained to the christ
[1:53:31] he had vindicated it
[1:53:33] a virgin birth
[1:53:35] healing the sick discern the thoughts of
[1:53:37] the hearts everything that you are
[1:53:39] supposed to be
[1:53:41] be the messiah he vindicated it
[1:53:44] he says
[1:53:46] raised from the dead and they still
[1:53:47] didn't recognize it they still didn't
[1:53:50] know it
[1:53:51] after the scriptures had been revealed
[1:53:54] in other words he came to fulfill
[1:53:56] what was written of him
[1:53:58] now remember how beautiful that is the
[1:53:59] word that he was revealing to them you
[1:54:01] are showing them they had walked right
[1:54:03] with him for three years
[1:54:05] and recognized that and know that he
[1:54:07] fulfilled that word
[1:54:09] there they went walking on to the down
[1:54:12] to emails he says just didn't understand
[1:54:15] it
[1:54:16] they didn't get it
[1:54:17] and for that purpose now you can think
[1:54:19] of it so think of it
[1:54:20] jesus went to them
[1:54:25] those two that needed the revelation
[1:54:28] why because they were represented
[1:54:31] before the foundation of the world and
[1:54:33] he needed to open up himself the way he
[1:54:35] did to the lady at the well
[1:54:38] now the prophet says that and this is in
[1:54:40] when the eyes are open they knew him he
[1:54:42] says that lady knew the scriptures
[1:54:45] even in a state
[1:54:47] he says her eyes come open and she knew
[1:54:50] him and when she recognized him he said
[1:54:53] i am me
[1:54:56] [Music]
[1:54:58] so they just busted the revelation so he
[1:55:00] needed to just give them that quickening
[1:55:03] he says now those disciples after the
[1:55:05] resurrection they didn't know the
[1:55:06] scripture
[1:55:07] that's the reason why to open it up to
[1:55:09] them
[1:55:10] and the very same way that the pharisees
[1:55:12] of the day didn't know him
[1:55:16] that's why he said to them search the
[1:55:17] scriptures
[1:55:19] for in them you think you have eternal
[1:55:20] life for they are they that testify of
[1:55:23] me
[1:55:23] what i came to do what i am to do
[1:55:26] and fail to see it
[1:55:29] no he says peter's eyes was opened why
[1:55:32] because he was looking for him
[1:55:35] he says nathanael's eyes was opened
[1:55:37] because he was looking for you
[1:55:41] [Applause]
[1:55:43] and jesus could say to them i knew you
[1:55:45] before the foundation of the world
[1:55:50] now in that same message now listen what
[1:55:52] the prophet says now in the face of all
[1:55:54] of this
[1:55:56] and he's asking a question here
[1:55:59] in the face of all of this in this age
[1:56:02] that we're living in
[1:56:04] what has it done to your eyes
[1:56:06] [Applause]
[1:56:06] [Music]
[1:56:07] [Applause]
[1:56:11] so we ask ourselves the question
[1:56:13] in this age that we're living in in the
[1:56:15] face of all of this
[1:56:17] what has it done to our eyes
[1:56:19] if we recognize him have our eyes come
[1:56:22] open
[1:56:23] and we see him
[1:56:24] for who he is
[1:56:26] what he was doing in this great
[1:56:28] unfolding of himself
[1:56:32] [Music]
[1:56:35] now the prophet says you you're gonna
[1:56:37] you're gonna be either associated with
[1:56:39] the pharisees
[1:56:40] or you'll be associated with the
[1:56:41] apostles or the believers
[1:56:43] now what was the difference between
[1:56:45] those two groups of people
[1:56:47] the one was theo theology
[1:56:50] they knew him by the theology
[1:56:52] the others knew him by a revelation
[1:56:55] so this is where we want to identify
[1:56:56] yourself with to know him
[1:56:59] is life
[1:57:00] [Applause]
[1:57:02] and that's how we want to know him by a
[1:57:04] revelation
[1:57:06] of jesus christ the prophet says why
[1:57:08] because that is the new birth
[1:57:11] now ever in in a message evidence of the
[1:57:13] resurrection
[1:57:15] listen to this one
[1:57:18] if that isn't just exactly what he's
[1:57:19] done again in these last days
[1:57:22] at the setting of the sun
[1:57:26] you can see where i'm going
[1:57:28] the prophet says now did you notice what
[1:57:30] he did with the church
[1:57:33] throughout the day
[1:57:34] and he's typing this with the road to
[1:57:36] emails
[1:57:40] so at the evening time he manifests the
[1:57:42] resurrection but throughout the day he's
[1:57:44] preaching it
[1:57:47] he says throughout the day he was only
[1:57:48] preaching the word
[1:57:51] but
[1:57:53] evening time has come
[1:58:02] now we know the message of the hour is
[1:58:04] the evening time message
[1:58:06] why because there will be light in the
[1:58:08] evening time
[1:58:11] now over seven church ages
[1:58:13] all he was doing he was preaching the
[1:58:15] resurrection
[1:58:16] or the revelation so over two thousand
[1:58:19] years in seven church ages was the road
[1:58:21] to emmaus
[1:58:23] that's all it was only because he was
[1:58:24] only revealing parts of himself in the
[1:58:27] scripture in that scripture
[1:58:28] justification
[1:58:30] a little bit in that scripture from
[1:58:32] their sanctification we're still on the
[1:58:34] road to emails over the seven church
[1:58:36] ages
[1:58:38] restoration of the gifts
[1:58:40] but now we have invited him in
[1:58:43] and we said to him abide with us
[1:58:46] in the evening time
[1:58:49] and now because we said abide with us in
[1:58:51] the evening time message
[1:58:53] he's going to be breaking the bread
[1:58:56] he's going to be opening the word
[1:59:00] he's going to be manifesting the
[1:59:01] resurrection
[1:59:05] by revealing the son of man
[1:59:08] why because it's only the son of man
[1:59:11] that was the one preaching along the
[1:59:13] road
[1:59:14] it's only the son of man in the evening
[1:59:16] time that was revealing and breaking the
[1:59:18] bread
[1:59:19] only he could do it
[1:59:21] no one else
[1:59:23] in this end time he only used a
[1:59:25] different body to do it
[1:59:27] but it was the son of man
[1:59:29] in a son of man
[1:59:31] at the evening time
[1:59:34] manifesting the resurrection
[1:59:36] and what do we say in this day he's
[1:59:38] alive
[1:59:40] we know him
[1:59:41] our eyes have come open and we know that
[1:59:43] jesus christ is the same yesterday the
[1:59:46] same today and forever more that's the
[1:59:49] reason why the one that was in the midst
[1:59:52] of the candlesticks was the son of man
[1:59:55] [Applause]
[1:59:57] he is the alpha and omega it was god
[2:00:00] himself through seven church ages it's
[2:00:02] god himself at the end time in the
[2:00:04] evening time
[2:00:05] that showed himself alive
[2:00:07] to you and i
[2:00:09] and our eyes have gone open
[2:00:14] and like them didn't our hearts burn
[2:00:16] within us
[2:00:17] as he spoke to us
[2:00:19] along the way
[2:00:20] didn't our hearts burn within us as he
[2:00:24] unveiled himself to us
[2:00:27] by a message of the hour
[2:00:29] [Applause]
[2:00:30] it's a wonderful revelation
[2:00:34] my mama let's give the lord a praise
[2:00:45] christ is the mystery of god revealed
[2:00:48] malachi 4 was to bring back the faith of
[2:00:51] the fathers
[2:00:52] to the children
[2:00:54] that's right to bring that same thing
[2:00:57] the same pillar of fire
[2:00:59] in on the scene the same signs the same
[2:01:02] wonders the same jesus
[2:01:05] making him the same preaching him the
[2:01:06] same vindicating him the same
[2:01:09] yesterday today and forever
[2:01:11] now remember the holy ghost alone is the
[2:01:13] revealer of the divine revelation of
[2:01:16] christ
[2:01:18] and has been in all ages now the prophet
[2:01:20] says now who did the word of the lord
[2:01:21] then come to
[2:01:23] only the prophet
[2:01:24] so what was william branham's ministry
[2:01:27] it was a son of man revealing
[2:01:30] the son of man
[2:01:32] manifesting scripture vindicating
[2:01:35] malachi 4 5
[2:01:37] vindicating luke 17 30 vindicating
[2:01:40] revelation 10 7.
[2:01:41] all it was was it was ace it was the son
[2:01:44] of man
[2:01:46] doing it through a son of man
[2:01:48] we're almost there
[2:01:50] serpent seed
[2:01:52] now god is healed from the eyes of the
[2:01:54] wise and the prudent and he promised
[2:01:57] to reveal it to the sons of the last day
[2:02:01] then he says which sons he says the same
[2:02:03] sons that rejoiced
[2:02:05] before the foundation of the world
[2:02:07] he says that's the reason that god is
[2:02:08] opening these things to us it is god
[2:02:11] bringing his sons into a manifestation
[2:02:14] now how is it doing this he says he goes
[2:02:16] beyond the limitations of
[2:02:18] any human understanding
[2:02:21] or any human knowledge
[2:02:23] he says he goes way into the spiritual
[2:02:25] revelation as he brings it to you
[2:02:28] this is in serpent seed
[2:02:31] then in christ is the mystery of god
[2:02:33] revealed now the prophet says now
[2:02:35] what is the new birth
[2:02:37] it is the revelation of jesus christ
[2:02:39] personally to you
[2:02:43] so that's the new birth
[2:02:46] he says it's christ in you and then
[2:02:48] prophet says that is the revelation that
[2:02:50] he builds his church upon
[2:02:53] he says it's god revealing to you this
[2:02:56] great mystery
[2:02:58] that
[2:02:59] and the prophet says that's the new
[2:03:01] birth
[2:03:03] in patmos vision
[2:03:05] placing the foundation upon the deity of
[2:03:06] the revelation it's god being revealed
[2:03:09] in christ now where is god to be
[2:03:11] revealed in
[2:03:12] he says his church with his people in us
[2:03:16] the same spirit the same works the same
[2:03:19] manifestation the same love
[2:03:21] he says the same forgiveness
[2:03:24] why because that's god's spirit being
[2:03:26] revealed in you in other words when he
[2:03:29] pours in himself
[2:03:31] it's his faith it's his virtue it's his
[2:03:34] knowledge
[2:03:35] and what does it be it bears his fruit
[2:03:39] what does it bear the same forgiveness
[2:03:42] the same long suffering
[2:03:44] the same gentleness
[2:03:46] the same patience
[2:03:48] he says peace mercy all that was in
[2:03:50] christ is in the church
[2:03:52] now the prophet says remember and keep
[2:03:54] this in mind all that god was he put
[2:03:57] into christ
[2:03:58] he was the fullness of the guarded
[2:04:01] bodily and all that christ was
[2:04:04] he poured into the church
[2:04:07] so what does that make the church the
[2:04:09] the mystery of christ revealed
[2:04:12] and so we see then this was god above us
[2:04:16] god was with us
[2:04:17] and now it's god in us
[2:04:20] am i give lord and a praise
[2:04:23] almost there we are muslim
[2:04:31] now at that day you will know
[2:04:34] when the revelation comes forth
[2:04:37] now the prophet says now this is greater
[2:04:40] greatest either seen you he that is in
[2:04:41] you
[2:04:42] he says if we could only realize what
[2:04:44] that scripture means
[2:04:47] he that is in you is greater than ye
[2:04:49] that is in the world
[2:04:52] he says we know it to be true he says
[2:04:53] but we just don't understand it
[2:04:56] then again he asks you know what is what
[2:04:59] is in you that's so much greater
[2:05:04] he says it's christ
[2:05:06] the anointed god
[2:05:08] that same anointed god that was in
[2:05:10] christ is in you
[2:05:12] [Applause]
[2:05:17] then if he then if if it is heated in
[2:05:20] you then it's no more you living
[2:05:23] it's christ in you
[2:05:25] the hope of glory
[2:05:30] he that is in you he says no wonder the
[2:05:31] winds and the waves obeyed him why
[2:05:34] because that was the very manifestation
[2:05:36] of god in flesh
[2:05:38] and when he spoke through that human
[2:05:40] lips it was god speaking
[2:05:43] he says no wonder the winds and the
[2:05:45] waves obeyed him
[2:05:47] then he turns around and he says no
[2:05:48] wonder the demons was paralyzed
[2:05:51] when he spoke
[2:05:53] why because it's only he that is above
[2:05:56] all principalities and powers and demons
[2:06:00] so they knew who was in the flesh
[2:06:03] of jesus christ
[2:06:05] because he's the one who spoke speaks
[2:06:09] no wonder he could
[2:06:11] still
[2:06:14] the wind and the waves
[2:06:17] why because that was the creator of all
[2:06:19] of heavens and earth
[2:06:21] because all of what we see and all of
[2:06:23] that that was created came about by his
[2:06:26] word
[2:06:27] so the creator spoke and said peace be
[2:06:30] still
[2:06:31] and nature had to obey
[2:06:33] why because the creator himself was
[2:06:35] speaking through that flesh
[2:06:37] or speaking through that mouth
[2:06:40] no wonder the dead
[2:06:43] that was turning back to the dust
[2:06:46] when he called his friend lazarus back
[2:06:48] from the dead
[2:06:50] now the prophet says that his nose had
[2:06:52] really fallen in in other words
[2:06:54] corruption had already set in
[2:06:56] so corruption knew its master
[2:06:59] and corruption had to reverse its
[2:07:00] process
[2:07:04] why because that was the god of the
[2:07:05] heavens and the earth
[2:07:07] that was speaking
[2:07:09] when he said lazarus
[2:07:11] come forth
[2:07:13] the dust that was turning back to dust
[2:07:17] became back again
[2:07:19] in human flesh
[2:07:20] why because the creator had spoken
[2:07:23] from those lips
[2:07:26] and again if that creator or that same
[2:07:28] spirit dwells in you
[2:07:30] it shall also
[2:07:32] quicken your mortal bodies
[2:07:35] it shall also speak through your lips
[2:07:39] it shall also raise the dead
[2:07:43] it shall also speak and heal the sick
[2:07:46] why because it's that very same spirit
[2:07:49] that was in jesus
[2:07:51] is dwelling in his bright body
[2:07:56] and
[2:07:57] demons will be paralyzed
[2:08:00] why because it's the same god that is
[2:08:01] speaking through your lips
[2:08:04] that's why will and bran could say when
[2:08:05] we sit
[2:08:07] life come back
[2:08:08] into the man
[2:08:10] because the holy spirit spoke through
[2:08:12] him
[2:08:13] and that's the reason why it could
[2:08:15] happen
[2:08:16] as he spoke
[2:08:18] and so now you see that scripture or
[2:08:20] rather that quote that the pastor loves
[2:08:22] to quote
[2:08:23] we will be the final voice to the final
[2:08:25] age and when she speaks it will flash
[2:08:27] like lightning
[2:08:30] why because what she speaks will create
[2:08:32] itself
[2:08:34] because the very anointing
[2:08:37] that same anointing is now in the body
[2:08:41] of believers
[2:08:43] and that's the second part of this
[2:08:45] threefold purpose of god preeminence
[2:08:48] he wants to live in his bright body
[2:08:52] and that ultimately is to take her back
[2:08:55] to an even condition
[2:08:59] my mama let's give the lord a praise
[2:09:01] i'm almost there the musicians can come
[2:09:03] up
[2:09:11] [Music]
[2:09:18] now there was something that that
[2:09:21] if we go back to cleopas and his friend
[2:09:23] even in the evening time
[2:09:26] when when when jesus had broken the
[2:09:28] bread
[2:09:30] the prophet says that
[2:09:33] they recognize the sign
[2:09:35] then he says
[2:09:36] that that he done was something that
[2:09:38] he'd done before
[2:09:40] his death
[2:09:42] and i was thinking i mean what did he do
[2:09:44] before that they could recognize
[2:09:46] that this is the same man
[2:09:49] if you think about it
[2:09:52] now in that message when the eyes went
[2:09:53] open they knew him
[2:09:55] the prophet says that
[2:09:56] he done something
[2:09:58] in front of them
[2:10:01] as a sign
[2:10:02] so that they might recognize him
[2:10:05] but he that thing that he done he done
[2:10:08] before his death
[2:10:12] now was a time that
[2:10:17] he was preaching to 5000 on the hill
[2:10:22] and after the sermon they wanted to feed
[2:10:24] all of this multitude of people
[2:10:29] and they found a little boy with a
[2:10:31] basket
[2:10:32] two fish five loaves of bread
[2:10:34] this is all we have to be able to feed
[2:10:36] this multitude of people
[2:10:39] now
[2:10:40] the cleopas and his friend must have
[2:10:42] been there
[2:10:45] they knew what happened that day
[2:10:48] why because that day and it's in in he
[2:10:51] that is in you also
[2:10:55] he broke the bread
[2:10:57] and as he broke the bread
[2:11:01] the prophet says even when he broke the
[2:11:03] fish he says another piece grew
[2:11:07] you may stand to your feet
[2:11:15] so that was the sign that they would
[2:11:17] recognize him by
[2:11:19] now
[2:11:22] i just want to see where that was
[2:11:28] i think i skipped it actually
[2:11:30] but in any case the prophet says that he
[2:11:32] he he performed a sign you can play
[2:11:34] something
[2:11:35] he performed the sign that he did before
[2:11:37] he was
[2:11:38] he was dead
[2:11:40] so if you think about it the only thing
[2:11:42] that could have happened is because
[2:11:43] remember now jesus if they could see his
[2:11:45] palm they might have seen
[2:11:47] the nail pierce
[2:11:50] when he had broken the bread
[2:11:53] that was how they recognized him
[2:11:56] and
[2:12:00] the prophet then turns around and he
[2:12:02] says now isn't this isn't he that is in
[2:12:04] you
[2:12:05] isn't that the same one that could take
[2:12:07] a piece of fish
[2:12:09] and break it
[2:12:11] and another piece grown
[2:12:14] then he says now he didn't actually have
[2:12:17] to have that
[2:12:19] he could have said it
[2:12:23] sure
[2:12:24] i'll just catch it just play play play
[2:12:26] with louder looks
[2:12:30] he says he didn't actually have to do
[2:12:32] that
[2:12:34] because he could have said it in other
[2:12:35] words he could have just spoken it
[2:12:38] and it would have multiplied itself
[2:12:41] but if you think about it you needed to
[2:12:43] do it in that way because the prophet
[2:12:44] says he's the same one that breaks the
[2:12:46] fish another piece grows he's the same
[2:12:48] one that breaks the bread another piece
[2:12:50] grows and they recognize that as the
[2:12:52] sign only the messiah could do that
[2:12:55] and so therefore at the breaking of the
[2:12:57] bread the opening of the word that's how
[2:12:59] they recognized him
[2:13:02] so why did he why did he keep that why
[2:13:04] did he do that it was so that he could
[2:13:06] reveal himself to cleopas and his friend
[2:13:09] at the cool of the evening in other
[2:13:11] words in that way he was manifesting the
[2:13:13] resurrection to them
[2:13:19] a message a prisoner
[2:13:22] if we could only keep that in our mind
[2:13:23] and according to the word of god that in
[2:13:25] these last days he's going to have a
[2:13:28] church
[2:13:29] he's going to have a people
[2:13:31] and these things that he promised is
[2:13:32] going to do them
[2:13:34] he said that he would and we're living
[2:13:36] in the time
[2:13:38] the prophet says we're there
[2:13:41] he's just trying to get us to be real
[2:13:44] prisoners
[2:13:46] to be locked in with him
[2:13:51] so that he could do that through us
[2:13:54] revelations 10 7
[2:13:56] but in the days of the voice of the
[2:13:58] seventh angel them
[2:13:59] when ye shall begin to sound
[2:14:02] the mystery of god
[2:14:04] is finished
[2:14:09] now as he closes out that message in
[2:14:11] christ is the mystery of god revealed
[2:14:13] now just look at the type
[2:14:15] because only in the evening time
[2:14:18] he revealed himself
[2:14:20] because all along the road it was just
[2:14:22] preaching
[2:14:23] the resurrection
[2:14:25] but at the evening time he was going to
[2:14:27] reveal himself
[2:14:29] now the prophet says you have to watch
[2:14:31] spiritual things
[2:14:33] then he says not knowing this
[2:14:36] but god knows it
[2:14:38] he tells the audience at that time when
[2:14:40] he was preaching crisis the mystery he
[2:14:41] says now if you'll turn and look at the
[2:14:44] clock
[2:14:45] it's on the dot two o'clock
[2:14:47] the end of the second pool the prophet
[2:14:49] says the third pool is at hand
[2:14:52] now what was the third pull it was the
[2:14:54] opening of the word
[2:14:56] it was the breaking of the bread
[2:14:59] and our eyes went open
[2:15:02] and we knew him
[2:15:03] we know who he is we have a perfect
[2:15:05] revelation
[2:15:07] you have a full understanding of who he
[2:15:09] is
[2:15:11] now all along the road it was god
[2:15:13] himself it was god through seven church
[2:15:16] ages it was god in that man
[2:15:20] that broke the bread it was gone in that
[2:15:22] man that was that that brought us the
[2:15:25] revelation
[2:15:26] of himself
[2:15:31] this is one of my best quotes i love
[2:15:32] this one
[2:15:35] anointed ones at the end time
[2:15:37] i wasn't the one that appeared down
[2:15:40] on that river
[2:15:41] i was only standing there when he
[2:15:44] appeared
[2:15:45] i'm not the one that performs these
[2:15:47] things and foretells these things that
[2:15:49] happens as perfect that they are i'm
[2:15:52] only one that's near
[2:15:54] when he does it
[2:15:58] the prophet showing to us clearly that
[2:16:00] he was only a son of man
[2:16:02] revealing the son of man
[2:16:06] i was only a voice that he used
[2:16:09] to say it
[2:16:10] i wasn't what it wasn't what i knew
[2:16:13] it's what i just surrendered myself to
[2:16:15] that he spoke through he spoke through
[2:16:19] it isn't me
[2:16:21] it wasn't the seventh angel oh no it was
[2:16:25] the manifestation
[2:16:26] of the son of man
[2:16:30] let's give the lord a praise man
[2:16:32] [Applause]
[2:16:44] it isn't me it wasn't the seventh angel
[2:16:48] it was the manifestation of the son of
[2:16:50] man it wasn't the angel his message it
[2:16:53] was the mystery
[2:16:55] that god unfolded
[2:16:58] it's not a man it's god
[2:17:01] the angel was not the son of man he was
[2:17:03] the messenger
[2:17:05] from the son of man
[2:17:07] the son of man is christ he's the one
[2:17:09] that you're feeding on
[2:17:11] you're not feeding on a man a man in his
[2:17:13] words will fail
[2:17:14] but you're feeding
[2:17:16] on the unfailing body word
[2:17:19] of the son of man
[2:17:22] amen
[2:17:24] he says if you haven't fed fully on
[2:17:26] every word to give yourself strength to
[2:17:28] fly above all
[2:17:30] these denominations and things
[2:17:32] of the world
[2:17:34] then he says will you at this time do it
[2:17:36] while we pray
[2:17:38] let's bow it
[2:17:40] grace is eternal father
[2:17:43] the very same way that he prayed that
[2:17:44] day when he said
[2:17:47] o father
[2:17:49] lord of heavens and earth
[2:17:52] i thank you
[2:17:54] that you have hid this you've hid these
[2:17:57] things from the wise and the prudent
[2:18:00] and you have revealed it to babes

[2:18:05] lord we want to thank you for your grace
[2:18:07] it's grace grace grace

[2:18:21] father bit us come

[2:18:30] the way he did with paul
[2:18:31] the way he did with peter the way he did
[2:18:34] with nathanael
[2:18:36] he reveals himself to us
[2:18:39] through a message of the end time
[2:18:41] and he says to us i am ye
[2:18:44] we thank you father god for this mystery
[2:18:46] of god
[2:18:48] that has been unveiled before us
[2:18:51] we thank you father god jesus that we
[2:18:52] are a part of that mystery
[2:18:55] we thank you lord that you have sent
[2:18:56] malachi 4 to take away the spiritual
[2:18:58] amnesia

[2:19:04] that we are part of that threefold
[2:19:06] purpose of god
[2:19:08] for him lord to take us back to an eaten
[2:19:10] condition
[2:19:12] and that's his ultimate
[2:19:15] plan of redemption for us
[2:19:18] father i thank you and i pray that this
[2:19:19] message will be a blessing
