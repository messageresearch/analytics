[32:52] for witness so he has did that don't you
[32:55] Genesis the beginning surely God has a

[33:03] has more than one man that he can lay
[33:06] his hands on because we are coming down

[37:32] South Africa brother Thompson was there
[37:34] and many others well such a glorious
[37:36] time process and this is something
[37:39] special for me to be with believers
[37:42] because there is not too many in this
[37:46] end time will be a few and to be
[37:50] together with you and fellowship with
[37:52] you and as the precious Word of God
[37:55] means a lot for me brother brand him I
[37:58] just want to take only this one quote
[38:02] from a letter from brother Brennan and
[38:05] it means also much for me to encourage
[38:08] us in the time we are living to make to
[38:12] make it to make it real in our heart to
[38:16] anoint ourselves and he is writing in a
[38:21] letter of 58 to the voice of healing
[38:26] and he's saying I now purpose to be away
[38:30] for a rest for a few months waiting on
[38:33] God and gaining new strings
[38:35] I'm confident said I will return to the
[38:38] field prepared for the fresh and greater
[38:41] anointing and I believe now this is a
[38:44] point please please watch it now
[38:47] I believe brother Branham said sets a
[38:50] vision of the coming glory will be
[38:53] fulfilled and he by his grades are a
[39:00] part of this coming glory make use in
[39:05] these meetings to get closer to him and
[39:10] speak to him personally it's not it's
[39:13] not so much our face the Prophet said
[39:18] God cannot can only have confidence in
[39:21] you when you fellowship with him and
[39:25] this is what we are coming here to
[39:28] fellowship with him during this time and
[39:32] this attitude of believing and prophets
[39:37] spoke of a true witness and to be a
[39:40] witness and we had one true witness but
[39:43] the brain said I am living since more
[39:45] than 30 years in heavenly places he said
[39:49] I never came out
[39:52] isn't that the challenge and he said
[39:55] this coming glory he prophesied an end
[39:58] this is here so we come into a place
[40:01] where we never come out and he said he
[40:04] said I have the confidence and I will
[40:06] never go out and this is our place his
[40:11] coming glory we are living right in the
[40:14] midst of this as there as many
[40:16] misunderstanding but that doesn't matter
[40:18] we are living right in the midst of his
[40:21] coming glory
[40:23] it's raining outside it's raining inside
[40:26] the Lord is with us Jesus said it's at a
[40:30] you don't know that I'm in the father
[40:34] that's great brothers and sisters and he
[40:37] said I am in you and you and me and we
[40:41] are together with him in the father's
[40:44] glory god bless you richly make use for
[40:48] your soul in these meetings and I'm so
[40:52] happy to be here and may God bless all
[40:54] the anointed ministers and may we say

[57:33] can go across to the first page and I
[57:37] just wanted to say how much I appreciate
[57:38] the inspiration pastor the harvest time
[57:43] it is so broad so wide you could take
[57:48] several there's many facets to to this
[57:50] Dimond of the harvest time it's not
[57:53] Luther's time it's not whizzed least I'm
[57:56] not the Pentecostal time but this is
[57:58] harvest time may a few words that I will
[58:01] speak be a great inspiration to you is
[58:05] my prayer the scriptures I want to look
[58:07] at today in the what shall I do I'll
[58:10] just raise my hand I guess to go on to
[58:12] the next slide I want to go just in
[58:15] these four scriptures so I'm 27 verse 1
[58:18] the Lord is my light and my salvation
[58:24] whom shall I fear
[58:28] him and the Lord is the strength of my
[58:33] life of whom shall I be afraid
[58:37] amen Psalms one two six six goes on to
[58:41] say he that goeth forth and weepeth Amen
[58:45] Bharath precious seed shall doubtless
[58:48] come your shall doubtless come again
[58:52] with rejoicing bringing his sheaves with
[58:57] him
[58:58] a man charity can't fail as I 59:19 so
[59:04] shall they fear the name of the Lord
[59:07] from the West and his glory from the
[59:11] rising of the Sun when the enemy shall
[59:17] come in like a flood the Spirit of the
[59:19] Lord shall raise lift up a standard
[59:24] against him
[59:25] hallelujah man finally Galatians 6:8 for
[59:31] he that soweth to his flesh shall of the
[59:36] flesh reap corruption but he that soweth
[59:40] to the spirit shall of the Spirit reap
[59:44] life everlasting praise be to God let's
[59:49] go to be the picture slide brothers and
[59:51] then we're praying now gracious God I'm
[59:53] very if you were honored not only to be
[59:56] behind the sacred desk today but also to
[59:59] be seeing my beloved brethren the
[1:00:02] ministry here o God if I were to express
[1:00:05] my the depths of my appreciation to each
[1:00:09] one without exception dear God it would
[1:00:12] take nearly over time but dear God may
[1:00:14] they collectively receive my very deep
[1:00:19] appreciation Lord and love for them for
[1:00:21] the battle we are fighting together for
[1:00:23] the their arms we are joining together
[1:00:25] to fight this common enemy

[1:00:48] you can be seated since God bless you
[1:00:50] richly praise be to God and I wanted to
[1:00:53] bring a little thought today which ties
[1:00:56] in obviously with the harvest time
[1:00:59] inspiration and I'm calling it seed in
[1:01:03] the son
[1:01:04] a man it sounds good it sounds happy but
[1:01:08] let's talk about it amen because it is
[1:01:11] the seed that's in the Sun and brothers
[1:01:14] you could just go to the next slide
[1:01:16] pretty much when I turn my papers you
[1:01:18] can just start over here a harvest time
[1:01:20] and I wanted to talk about this great
[1:01:22] great subject as Noah and Moses and
[1:01:26] David reflected the coming of this
[1:01:31] perfect bridegroom
[1:01:32] so has Lusa Pentecost and wisly and
[1:01:39] Pentecost reflected the coming of a
[1:01:42] perfect bride isn't that real clear a
[1:01:46] man as those reflectors reflected
[1:01:51] jeepers
[1:01:52] he was a masterpiece so is the bride and
[1:01:55] identified masterpiece hallelujah and it
[1:01:59] came on like that and God is depending
[1:02:02] on you to be cut by the hammer by the
[1:02:08] chisel he's depending on you to stand
[1:02:12] there and say Lord cut me Lord
[1:02:16] shake me Lord take away everything
[1:02:21] that's not me hallelujah he's depending
[1:02:25] on you to stand there say Lord I'm ready
[1:02:28] to be cut hallelujah
[1:02:31] somebody once said we love the surgeon
[1:02:34] but we don't like the knife
[1:02:37] we love the surgeon which is the Lord
[1:02:40] Jesus Christ but we don't like the knife
[1:02:42] then I hurts but we give God glory he's
[1:02:45] chipping chipping chipping chipping
[1:02:47] everything away that we can become a
[1:02:50] masterpiece in this end time praise be
[1:02:53] to God that's why I put the picture of
[1:02:55] the masterpiece up there let's go let's
[1:02:57] go next to the next picture brothers and
[1:02:59] here's something I think is gonna be a
[1:03:01] blessing to you but now at the end time
[1:03:04] look at this shucks here notice in the
[1:03:09] week
[1:03:09] the complete mystery of the life is suit
[1:03:17] up inside that shock we see it in Luther
[1:03:23] coming up we see it in tassel coming up
[1:03:27] we see it in the stalk coming up coming
[1:03:32] over here now it's in the in a shuck
[1:03:34] form almost like at the Pentecostal age
[1:03:37] but the real mystery is hidden side
[1:03:43] hallelujah that's where you'll find it
[1:03:45] inside there
[1:03:46] you can't just rejoice with the shock
[1:03:49] the shock is just doing a job
[1:03:52] hallelujah but inside is the mystery
[1:03:55] that is sealed up I guess that seal has
[1:03:59] to be broken Amen for this this mystery
[1:04:03] to be revealed another row these are
[1:04:06] kind of platform quotations and the next
[1:04:08] one can play brothers he says oh brother
[1:04:12] sister are you catching it we could go
[1:04:15] cross brothers to the to the next life
[1:04:17] thanks and he says don't you see it's
[1:04:20] been failed all these ages according to
[1:04:26] what God said it will be opened in the
[1:04:29] last days those seven seals would be
[1:04:34] broke and the full thing would come into
[1:04:39] view of the people aren't you God for
[1:04:43] the fool thing the seals have been
[1:04:47] broken we can see the fool thing we know

[1:10:10] grains gotta be more ripened when I was
[1:10:13] a child I spake as a child I understood

[1:11:45] the gifts sorry what was sanctification
[1:11:49] Pentecostal was the restoration of the
[1:11:51] gifts but this can we shout this is this
[1:11:58] is the introducing the headstone the
[1:12:04] last day the bride tree which is
[1:12:08] contrary to all of it but it's the same
[1:12:12] light for the matured we've got a mature
[1:12:16] we can't be into petty politics and and
[1:12:21] envy and comparing and childishness

[1:17:32] the seed and it protects
[1:17:35] Kamisha protects it protects it and it
[1:17:40] nurtures it until happening and or if
[1:17:45] it's behind the shock who can see that
[1:17:48] can shot a man it will never get ripened

[1:43:57] but Jesus was all alone but he never
[1:44:00] said oh I'm alone and what Watchtower
[1:44:02] just mentioned this then I'll move on he
[1:44:04] says he just feels just a little bitty

[1:44:56] no David this guy has a soldier from his
[1:45:00] from his youth David you need some
[1:45:03] protection David said I don't need no

[1:45:17] his armor he put the helmet of brass on
[1:45:19] his head
[1:45:20] David he girded his sword and he is safe
[1:45:24] but he had not proved it he says I
