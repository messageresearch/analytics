and amen God bless you thanks for coming out have faith in God Amen tonight we want to have a a scripture one scripture second Peter 1 we want to read from verse 47 2 Peter 1 47 says here whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by these you might be partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust and besides this giv all diligence add to your fate virtue and to Virtue knowledge and to knowledge Temperance and to Temperance patience and to patience godliness and to Godliness brotherly kindness and to brotherly kindness charity may God bless his word you may be seated oh praise the Lord amenl our title tonight the restoration of the true Apostolic Faith true Apostolic teaching through Bible Spirit of a subject the word living and in action the Bible bride and have an inspiration life and godliness through the knowledge of him life and godliness through the knowledge of him now Hosea 4:6 says my people are destroyed for lack of knowledge because thou has rejected knowledge I will also reject thee that thou shall be no priest to me seeing that thou Hast forgotten the Lord of thy God I will also forget thy children so the devil's job is to keep people in ignorance that you know not you don't know and the Bible talk about a fold Ministry till we come into the unity of the faith into the knowledge of the Son of God unto a perfect man am so there has to be a restoration back to the Bible to come back to believe just what God have said because God can't lie regardless of what it looks like is what God Said don't ever look what it looks like you know is what God had said and once we stick with that it will materialize isn't that right so therefore what the devil trying to keep you away away from is thus say the Lord and thus say the Lord comes to the prophets sir so man shall live bread alone but every word that proceed out of the mouth of God and the mouth of God is not men mouth of God is not any man the mouth of God Is His prophets so beginning at Moses who write the the Genesis and all these books and whatnot God spoke to these men and then other men at a su level carry out and pack out the message that these men said but God always have His prophets that bring the the final abitor of the word then what God said it comes to the m of the the prophet that's why the prophet said the spirit the prophet and the bride will say the same thing and what they say will already been said in the word because the prophet cannot come contrary to the word there is a false prophet a prophet only could bring what the word what is in the word so that's why if the word was lost remember the word was lost Through The Seven Ages God sent a prophet to get us back to that that's the whole thing you know that back to that back to the restored word Oh Glory to God why he said I'll send you Elijah the prophet and he shall turn your hearts back to the faith of the fathers because the faith of the fathers come by original word so God had to bring us back to the original and God's spoken word is the original not not not confusus not not all these philosophers no God word is original not not not not Facebook posts not not Time magazine articles God word is original so you have to come back to God's word not this man have an opinion about what God's word say and and and and you know he's seen it so and it's unfolding so not that what God said Oh Glory to God we have to come back to what God said because that's how the devil was able to bring destruction he asked Eve what did God say because he didn't hear from God and you have to hear from God and if you hear from God you're going to get the answer tonight oh give the Lord a shout in the house glory to God do you get that tonight so you get from God by Revelation and Revelation is the father revealing by his spirit so the devil job is to do what get people out of the Spirit get them in the flesh get them into carnality get them all natural but Flesh and Blood ha not reveal it unto you but my father have reveal this upon unto you and Upon This Rock I'll build my church Oh Glory to God do you believe that so there's going to be a Bible bride word living and in action I talk spoke word quotes I'm talking about word living and in action because those disciples they were the Living Word Oh Glory to God because the New Testament was not written yet they were now about to write it by their lives oh give the Lord some Praises so they become the Living Word and the bride in the last days will become the Living Word Oh Glory to God not just a spoken word coat but the Living Word itself it will Thunder Oh Glory to God that will Thunder and I'm going to shake hell's Kingdom you're going to shake the devil's Kingdom oh give the Lord some Praises live voices it going to thunder once more once more the world will hear direct from God it will be a voice word a Living Word Oh Glory to God hallelujah it will line up with the Scriptures it will line up with Living Word it will line up with the spoken word oh God the spoken word The Living Word and the written word Oh Glory to God a Bible bride Hallelujah the word living and in action Oh Glory to giving the world one last view of what God is like oh give the Lord a praise in the house giving the world one last view of what this almighty God is like the unveiling of the Mighty God this bride will unveil God and to unveil God you have to Veil him first oh give the Lord some praises and he is veiled by the word because the secret is the word is in the bride Oh Glory to God all she waiting for is the mind of Christ to know what he wants done with the word oh praise the name of the Lord so don't perish because of lack of knowledge how people get rip off and all kind of fin Financial schemes because they don't know and somebody say hey latest thing they they crash some pyramid scheme some kind of scheme is a scheme that way it is a money scheme lack of knowledge so therefore brother brandham says that he rather a man right in spirit and wrong in Doctrine than a man um how you say um I prefer a man W in the spirit and wrong his doctrine that a man writing his doctr wrong in the spirit that's all well and good but the message didn't come for us to be wrong in Doctrine the message come that will be right in spirit and right in Doctrine because God sent a master teacher in the last days to bring us back to the apostolic teaching because the standard was Paul so God picked a man that could even go further than Paul and he picked that man William Maran brandham to be that end time Elijah Prophet to reveal the whole mystery of God for the rapturing of the church that's the object of revealing the entire mystery Hallelujah and we have sent it more than once the reveal of the Mysteries was that the people might know how to behave themselves and conduct themselves by the spirit Oh Glory to God so the Mysteries is not just to say well we have Mysteries and we following Mysteries we in fivefold Ministry because we can talk plenty and talk long hours about knowledge and information that's not the purpose the purpose is that we'll know how to behave because your behavior is what will set you onto adoption your behavior is what you will get the father's approval your behavior is where the voice will say this is my son in whom I'm well pleased please please to set him to be tested oh give the Lord some Praises I feel good about that one brother Kang Hallelujah not pleased to get power yet not pleased to get power yet my son is I'm pleased with him I could test him now I could test him with his wife I could test him with his children I could T him with SI sickness I could test him I could test him whatever I could test him now I am pleased and that's the road Jesus walked the father was pleased and God loed Jesus to be tested and tempted and then he overcome Hallelujah after busting the devil's throat in the wilderness with it is written because I was a sharp sword you know you know sharp that is Devil Couldn't touch him with that you know it is written it is written is also written a man that could stay with that and deny his own self flesh feelings emotions and everything else that's a powerful man oh glory to God he have control over himself and before the adopted sons have control and power over others and other things he have power over himself oh give the Lord some Praises so Jesus was led by the spirit into the willingness to to demonstrate power over self oh give the Lord a that is what is lacking power over self and the word itself come to bring power over self by these seven things after to your faith virtue and to Virtue knowledge and to knowledge temperance and to Temperance patience and to patience godliness and to godl brotherly kindness these seven steps and charity Oh Glory Glory these virtues are the tools and the means and the keys to unlock power over self what has been the problem the problem is as soon as God bless somebody they get to over yes I think two Sundays are back but we preach about it that God was telling them when they get in land remember me don't forget me the land is a promotion you're not under Pharaoh you're not inness you could plant it's your land because I give it to you have H and Je but is your land I give it to you you going to get blessed Oh Glory to God no more man are falling you could plant and reap you could SW you could get blessed with the labor of your hands Oh Glory to but remember me remember that have gods in it it have people in it it have all Inspirations in it don't go and follow them Inspirations I am the Lord thy God and beside me there is none else have no Idol before me no man Idol Oh Give the Lord a shout no car Idol no woman Idol no Idols Before Me Oh Glory to no church Idol no Pastor man Idol Oh message of the hour man Idol no Idol before me I the Lord thy God oh glory to God give the Lord I

their children keep passing on the word this living God we talking about the God of Moses the god of Isaac Jacob the god of Abraham that God is alive tonight he are sleeping and he are dead he's the same yesterday today and forever that same God that work with William Branham he is here tonight oh glory to God he took the prophet but not the angel oh I see another mind the angel come down from

you panto so long farewell friend on no friend let that work in me let Christ's virtue his knowledge flow out that I may able to teach those so this is fold ministry here now that the virtue going to come and flow out his knowledge that we might teach correct teaching Apostolic teaching for God has set in the church Apostles prophets teachers pastors evangelists all for the perfecting watch this part now and bringing all these virtues into it that's the F Ministry they can't bring in what they do have that's why you say let Christ work in me upon my Foundation let virtue knowledge flow out that had from inside out all right watch bringing all these virtues into it for that Perfection of the coming of the Son of God see that there brother George not son of man not son of man son of man is Luke something3 but after son of man is Son of God each one of these stones are Material off of that one this is material of this which is each one right each one of the virt belong into him and they are pouring out out of him down through them amen and then we have you how God has set some in the church through the labor pains they get tremendous sometime Hallelujah and the church is that this is what is lacking now people just believe is almost like they're entitled to the Rapture they're entitled to God blessing because they believe a prophet I not seen that in the word here I am not seeing that friends I'm in the message as an entitlement no here what he say when a church is groaning under the persecution of the outside world Believing on the Lord Jesus that the promise that's the promise of the Holy Ghost is just as real to us the promise alone the promise you have to believe the promise you know the promise of the Holy Ghost you get to the Holy Ghost just the promise of it that's the promise when when when when Jesus said behold I send the promise of my father upon you those disciples didn't say well you know they see my soul so you know I mean no they see his whole thing they were believing the promise of the father behold I send the promise of my father upon you but carry in the city of Jerusalem until until your head get fat until no until you get more knowledge of the seals and the vials and the trumps and the wars no until you receive power from on high oh glory to God that's why when power come and manifest itself they know is from high on high oh glory to God we have nothing to show but power coming from shout out on high some again on high power power come on high oh glory to God watch this now that the promise of the Holy Ghost just read to us as it was the Pentecost could you give me some more here on the platform how they grown and cry under labor pains groaning church that's what I want you to be this a Bible Church here groaning travailing Lord give me the Holy Ghost Lord Fill Me Lord refill me Lord baptize me Lord revive me Lord steal me Lord not come and sit down with a book and a pen you waiting to write a new mystery cu the Bible prophesied they have teachers the ears itching because they're not satisfied with what the word presting so they tired hear these promises is it real to them yet or no but they tired he give us something new Moses went up to get the Commandments of God and in no time at all somebody felt inspired and led say m we don't know where going make us a god Aaron Aaron is a priest Aaron is Moses like right hand man make us a god somebody get get get all the gold they make a golden calf by the time Moses come down they don't Worship in a c already a next God a next anointing and next inspiration next spirit and and you know it's not that God I know what they're doing you know but God working through a channel Moses the ears of God Moses on the on the on the Rock hearing from God when Moses finished so Moses is a man going down there hearing songs of rry is because another God there you know then who's on the Lord's Side and you know the story destruction so watch when they are born and positionally born born and positionally born not just one not just one when they are born and positionally Born Into the kingdom of God then the Holy Ghost has set in the church not something Pastor say I'm a pastor I'm an apostle well you see how I'm moving I like a prophet you see a few words on inspiration not that that's foolishness that's not the message of the hour those men are lined down the pulpit they have to be positionally born God has to identify and place them positionally then then then the Holy Ghost has set not a man Appo not the congregation vo him not not we have nobody else to put not the pastor dead and some Pastor take over and that it and that it no then God set God after to set in the church and and what God set no man could unset no congregation could unet no Bishop could unset God sets in the church not just in the set in the church God sets in the church Glory Give the Lord a shout in the house God sets in the church Oh Glory to God and God will stand by the man he sets in the church hold Heaven behind that man because that is God's Man Standing on the word that he plac position amen Wonder Hallelujah watch this then God's what then the Holy Ghost has sett in the church some Apostles not one some prophets not one some teachers not one some pastors not one some evangelist not one then he give dear speaking with tongues interpretations of tongues knowledge wisdom healings Gifts of healing all kinds of Miracles yes it's one complete package it's not a fivefold Ministry and it ends let me say it good it's not a fold Ministry and it ends because gifts is Pentecostal no no no no no this is the word here now this is Apostolic teaching this is how the Bible we have a Bible right 1 Corinthians 12 says this verse four now there are diversities of gifts but the Same Spirit yes there are differences of administration but the same lord and there are diversities of operations but it is the same God say same God same God same God which worketh all in all but the manifestation of the spirit is given to every man to profit with for to one is given by the spirit the word of wisdom to another the word of knowledge by The Same Spirit to another Faith by The Same Spirit I like how Paul emphasizing It Is by The Same Spirit not a different Spirit to another the gifts of healing by The Same Spirit to another the working of Miracles to another prophecy to another Discerning of spirits to another diverse kinds of tongues to another the interpretation of tongues but all these work at that one and the selfsame spirit dividing to every man severly as you will for as the body is one and had many members and all members of that one body being many are one body so also is Christ yes sir and this is where we get 1 Corinthians 13 by one Spirit we are all baptized into one body whether we be Jews or Gentiles do you understand that 144,000 will be sealed I heard the number the angel from the East having the seed of the Living God I thought they seeding their soul too but they have to be sealed and before the Jews are sealed there's a bride to be sealed with the same Holy Ghost the inkhorn writer oh give the Lord some Praises for by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body whether we be Jews or Gentiles whether we be bonded or free and have be made to all drink into one Spirit yes sir for the body is not one member but many if the foot shall say because I'm not the hand I'm not the body is it therefore not of the body if the air shall say because I'm not an eye I'm not of the body is it therefore not of the body if the whole body were an eye where were they hearing if the whole body were hearing where were the smelling now God God here we go had set the members every one of them in the body as it had pleased him oh give the Lord some Praises L as it has pleased him he pleaseed to give you a gift of a a spirit of Miracles he pleased to give you a gift of faith please to give you a gift of discernment please to give you a gift of faith please to give you tongues and interpretation GL Hallelujah that's Verse 18 now God had set the members every one of them in the body as that pleased him and if they were all one member where is the body now but now are there many members but yet one body and here we go the eye cannot say unto the hand I have no need of thee no again the head to the feet I have no need of you nay much more those men members of the body which seem to be more feeble are necessary I want to underline are necessary tonight you may see them as feeble but God say are necessary and those members of the body which we think to be less honorable upon these we bestow more abundant honor and our uncomely paths have more abundant comeliness for our comely Parts have no need but God has tempered the body together having given more abundant honor to the part which lacked purpose verse 25 that there be no Schism in the body that's the purpose that has to be tempered Hallelujah everything in its place we want the hands where it's supposed to be the eyes where it was supposed to be you want to turn back but you can't want don't want one eye going the back of your head because you want to see what's going on behind no you want your eyes in front just how God put you you want your ears in the right position is that right here we go now that there be no Schism in the body and that the MERS should have all this is zeroing now to a purpose that the members should have the same care one for another oh give the Lord some Praises glory to God the car that to come now Hallelujah and when one member suffer all the other members suffer with it when one member be honored all the members Rejoice with it now jealous Spirit envious Spirit do that you know that by that Spirit not anybody that get a fight you can't congratulate you can't honor you can't bless God bless somebody and you fighting up in your own mind because you want what they have but you're not doing what they did oh give the Lord some praise at me started tonight oh give the Lord some Praises you don't know what they have been through to be plucked up and blessed the way they are blessed I can give you a hint though pray to the father who see it in secret and he who it see it in secret shall reward thee shout out open the Don't Be Afraid again openly he going to reward you openly all right so whether when when one member suffer all the members suffer with it when one member be honored all the other members Rejoice with it and ye are the Body of Christ and members in particular God had set some in the church first apostles secondarily prophets thirdly teachers after that Miracles then Gifts of healing helps governments diversity of towns so this covers all the administration yes sir helps governments diversity of tongues gift of healing Miracles and the fivefold question verse 29 are all Apostles are all prophets are all teachers are all workers of Miracles have all the gifts of healing do all speak with tongues do all interpret but covet earnestly the best gifts yet show I unto you a more excellent way and after that you get 1 Corinthians 13 which I would not read tonight where he said do I speak with the tongues of men and angels do I give my body to be burned have the charity I am nothing do I feed the poor do I have all knowledge including the Thunders and the vials and the woes and have and all Mysteries without charity I am nothing oh give the Lord a shout in the house are you enjoying the word tonight all right St a per man Prophet speaks before this is addressing fold Ministry now all right so notice for a while now what I'm doing right fold and the people fivefold and the church I'm not trying to separate it I'm trying to show you both sides of the coins what's have to happen before you can give out virtue you have to have it that that could stand by itself that statement stand by itself tonight that's what we preaching you can't teach that you have to have it to give it virtue is what came out of Christ Hallelujah with the blood issue he said he said uh uh um the one person touching he said who touched my clothes the disciples said but everybody touching you he said no I felt a virtue left me he had it that's why she could pull it out oh give the Lord a shout it wasn't a teaching it wasn't a mystery it wasn't a revelation it was a power that was resident in him that have to be resident in us oh give the Lord a shout in the house Oh Glory to God do you see it tonight before you can give out virtue it is specific not Faith because faith is a revelation faith comes from God we can't give you faith we can preach the word but the spirit have to give you Faith Revelation comes from God faith comes from God but virtue is power coming on top on top the faith is virtue in other words virtue start the spirit life saying something things tonight Hallelujah virtue is not information virtue is power sir Hallelujah virtue start the spirit ladder that comes upon Faith you break into the spirit when you break into virtue you break into the spirit when you break into Power you break into the spirit now you can get Spirit knowledge not information it's the knowledge of Jesus Christ oh give the Lord some Praises tonight hallelujah hallelujah Give the Lord some Praises Hallelujah before you can give out virtue you have to have it so add to your faith virtue understand he said now then thirdly you add knowledge now that don't mean worldly knowledge CU that is foolishness to God but knowledge to judge judge what right from wrong how do you judge it then if you got Christian knowledge with your virt Faith you judge whether the word is right or wrong and if you can lay aside all your Creeds your unbelief and everything you claim you have done then you have knowledge to believe that God cannot lie that is what knowledge break out to you oh Glory this is good my I'm enjoying this tonight knowledge correct knowledge taught reveals to you that God can't lie that the first level of knowledge that means there's no unbelief in you to doubt God what God said because the revelation of knowledge means God can't lie once that word speaks it it got to come to pass hey the devil have no room to push you back with unbelief no room because you have a knowledge now that God can't lie oh give the Lord some Praises hallelujah hallelujah so it makes you shake off your unbelief shake off your doubt shake off your fears because the knowledge reveals that God can't lie Hallelujah all right let's continue now watch something let every man words be a lie and man be true see now you're getting knowledge that is supreme knowledge you don't have to have four degrees in some college because all these virtues are given to you by God to place upon the foundation of your faith that you might come to the full stature of a real living man of God at knowledge because knowledge of his word you must believe it this way such as we believe it and accept it that the days of Miracles is not passed knowledge that what God Said God is able to perform form then he said Abraham believe that and when he was 100 years old he staggered under the promise of God true unbelief look how ridiculous that would look here's a man 100 years old looking for a baby to be born into his home by a woman 90 years old almost 50 years past bearen Liv with her since a young girl Teenage here he is his live stream dead and SAR room Dead all hopes is gone as far as hopes is concerned against hope he beli in Hope because he acknowledged that God was able to keep everything that he promised okay the Lord praise so I don't care how dead you are tonight if God say resurrect you revive you restore you you are going to be revived resurrected restored oh give the Lord a shout in the house I can't look at what the eyes see I have to look at what God promised what God Said Amen through the knowledge now when you got it like that then add to your faith when you got true virtue add it to your faith amen and watch well watch he said no well no this scripture is just right and acts 238 I don't know what to do about it because you don't have enough knowledge enough to know God yet but the Bible doesn't contradict itself but when you can see that the scripture is not contradictory that you can say that and can see that by revelation of God the whole word of God is wrot in Mysteries and only the knowledge of God can reveal it then when you get and say and puncture every word of God with an amen add that to your faith now you're getting to be pretty a good man now you're coming up see with faith with virtue knowledge is building this man no way of escaping it this is the way to become in the full statue of Christ to judge right from wrong then you are beginning judge right when the preacher says the days of Miracle is passed the Bible says Jesus Christ him yesterday forever then you know what to believe the next thing the preacher will tell you many you say these things you read the Bible they for another day we don't need it we don't need to practice those things Divine Healing we don't practice speaking in tongues in the church to keep our church straight we don't do this now let's continue a man can't understand why people shout a man can't understand why a human being's language would change and speak in tongue the natural man can't see how a glory of God could come over a man's eye and he sees vision and tell man certain things and what to do tell them things that are fixing to happen and things fixing to come to pass like the Lord did the natural mind trying to figure it out now to see and man speaking in tongues here we go and somebody interpret and tell just exactly to a certain member of the body what they have done and what they should not do this quote came from Kelly Shar this quot with me powerful so this is showing what the operation of the gifts is for do you see this now come to a service somebody speaking tongues like interpret and speak to sister so and so specifically what you're doing is off stop doing that and sister so and so know that there who speaking tongues and interpet knows nothing about that it's only God doing that do you understand that God is not coming down in a p of fire and speaking out of the pill of fire like it in the Old Testament in that way no he's using the gifts that is given by the spirit into the body he don't have to use the ministry be the pulpit they have tongues and interpretation of tongues for that amenallah to war you don't pass that road because they're having an earthquake and having a flood tonight pass this other Road that's what he said that he gift of the spirit in operation that has to be restored back in the church so I'm prophesying tonight of the restoration of the gifts back in the church along with the placement of the fold Ministry in the church oh give the Lord a shout after born and positionally born then God sets in the church tongues and interpretations and gifts and all these that we want the whole scroll glory to God I want nothing less than what his promising is are hallelujah hallelujah Glory Hallelujah he said we are not building an organization I'm not here this morning to build an organization Christ never sent me to build an organization let's go Christ sent me William brandham to build individuals shout out individuals so where the message PO on the control churches they fast and they out of place take your hands off of God's people mind your own business see out your own church Oh Glory to God leave mines alone leave what God put in my hands alone this church is suffering no outside influence Oh Glory to God no outside man no outside influence at all has to be the Holy Ghost you yeah saying this and yeah saying that you say it you say it you tell me what they say who I supposed to say I ain't quoting this I quoting that I quoting this one as if that a password supposed to say the apost and this one say and that one say it's is that right I will say what God put in my mouth only what God put in my mouth oh glory to God hallelujah Christ sent me to build individuals into the stature of Jesus Christ purpose that they might be the PowerHouse and the dwelling place of the Spirit by his word to build the individ to that place glory to God each person here we want you to be a Powerhouse Oh Glory think about it now you generating your own power you have to plug into somebody else when you come here come here on fire you come here like a Dynamo because you have Dynamics upon you you have a self-generating power inside of you he that believeth in me as the scripture said out of his belly shall flow Oh Glory to God that Dynamo self- regenerating self charging Oh Glory they that solar thing you know Hallelujah this is inside your belly Oh Glory to God so then God sent him to the bill individuals to the stat of Christ that they might be a Powerhouse The Dwelling Place of the spirit by his word not build an organization to a great organization denomination but build individual to Sons and Daughters of God that's the idea so if you become a whole son like you hear Brother Isaac preach the fful ministry is over when we all come into the knowledge and perfect man they can't perfect what is perfected you have come to Perfection the word is living seven living virtues shoes yes sir Hallelujah then the spirit could pick you up like Phillip and send you here and pick up like spirit and assign you here like Peter and Paul being sent here have nobody permission please not school days Miss yes sir no it don't have that men still want that you know yeah men still want this thing here boy and because we not giving it they have problems they want the salute the parade of the beef we call it and God hates that that is man on Parade God will get the glory from that you know and that's why God tell him tell them there too much of people here they go they go say by the power the might they get this Victory cut it down and that get Gideon 300 oh give the Lord some Praises because God wanton Glory big golad little David God get Glory I'll cut his head off Oh Glory to get God glory from that oh glory to God not getting Glory from our strength and our might our intellect that why Paul said I come among you with trembling oh that your faith will not rest oh in the knowledge that I have in my enticing speech and words but in the power of God glory to God so when Paul left there they know the power of God hit the place Dynamics and mechanics form and latter rain word and spirit that what Paul had glory to God and they knew the spirit was energizing the word they knew it wasn't the intellect of man they knew it was the power of God oh my hallelujah praise God Amen you believe it tonight all right let's go the scriptures cannot lie and there's no private interpretation the Bible said you just believe it the way it's written you've got to have these things and the only way you'll ever be able to have them is to have heaven born knowledge and heaven born knowledge will vindicate the word heaven born knowledge wouldn't explain it way with a different type Give an example years ago I met a sister or a sister I believe and and she was I sister to a brother can't remember exactly but she was talking about justification wood with m in it soon as she said that I no just going off because they know better than that but it's a type they want to use to show that is different from what in the books and they getting this thing so she say justification script of the Moss no justification pick up the word with moss in it sanctification script of the most and Holy Ghost shaped the wood I say but is the same wood the wood had changed is just SC M off and you do carving like them fellas and he block this carve stuff out the wood I said tell me what the prophet says justification you pick up a dirty glass satification you wash the glass Holy Ghost you pour milk into the glass I see a Fredy milk that's what they AF that milk is a new element that is the Holy Ghost to pour inside your glass you shaped the word the same old trining wood shaped and he pass like this because God shaping that man shaping that you that a't God shaping that at all all right so you've got to believe not make believe it but you got to say I watch now you got to believe not make believe it none of these make beliefs see if you say try to say I got it don't be a black bird putting on peak of feathers in yourself because they will fall out they are not naturally grown in there they are stuck in now there will be another thing on this knowledge we might speak of Godly knowledge has the Bible in this day lost its meaning a lot of people tell you that the Bible doesn't exactly mean that if God watches over me and corrects me in my sin and if I am a Son of God he does that he does you that way Sons and Daughters when you do anything wrong he corrects you then if God is so particular about you that he watches over you and corrects you how much more has he in his word in other words God who could correct us will guard this word to make sure it have no contradict treating in it in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God the word is the revelation of Jesus Christ that word saying again the word is the revelation of Jesus Christ the Bible said so Christ being revealed in his word and if he has watched over you when you transgress these laws he condemns you for it how much more has he watched over his law that condemns you amen I believe in genuine Holy Ghost knowledge Holy Ghost knowledge will always punctuate the word with amen hallelujah praise God oh let's continue let let's knowledge not worldly it's reasons any kind of knowledge worldly knowledge reasons but faith has no reasoning God reveals to you a certain thing is going to happen every scientist in the world will tell you it's contrary it could not happen you believe it anyhow see it doesn't reason the Bible said we cast down reasoning we don't reason with faith you know we come like come from Mexico um I was tired I kind of maybe sleep along and then get to the airport and by the time I get to the counter they say well the the door for taking luggage closed so now I have to go and stand by and I don't think I'm traveling since 982 I've never been on standby before this is the first time yeah I can't remember ever being on standby so I was supposed to leave on the morning flight and this now put me on the evening flight I said so what happen if I don't get on these flight evening time they say I keep coming back until until until and this is the end of the year everybody and the grandmother come in to come for Hest night everybody everybody so when I got to the airport now I prayed you know that because Lord I said Lord since in can since in in in Mexico I want to go home straight after last I want to go straight home I wish had a PL take me straight home one time um but I said Lord I really don't want to stay back here again you know so when I got to the airport now I seen 12 people on standby now when I first check in the counter they say my name was first I was I was glad for that you know I have first choice and first opportunity when I got to the airport I see my name is for and there's a family of three same name in front of me so I see I'm fourth and then there are uh eight other people waiting for standby so they going in going in they say well cter close everything now so now they're dealing with the standby and in the meantime now I guess some level of unbelief start to hit me I said to check hotels now if I had to go to a hotel back to hotel and which I Repent afterwards of course I had to repent and uh there want to know what is happening so the man said I have two seats available so he turned to the woman was a family of three a woman and a son and daughter they were big children and said you'll have to split up only two could go two will go and one stay back and what and the woman said I can't split up and that is how I was able to get in I I was amazed I say that's like a miracle because if there was four different people in front there or three in front of me different people I couldn't go and come home when I when when I came but I stood there and watched a miracle happen in front of my eyes the woman said no I'm not going to split up I ready to go second to last person inside the plane that was that was close but then I learned something though unbelief doesn't hinder God and we have to believe him and trust him more I have to believe and trust him more we have to I mean we are challenge it was a challenge because this is not normal and my all all I wondering now is if my luggage will come with me I say I want what they had the luggage but now I have a kind of tag that I have in my suit case that I could find out which way it is when I got in the plane I check it luggage say it's right there on me the luggage right there say I said these people good they was they have standby waiting whoever gets stand by they to the luggage in so luggage coming with me felt good about that but it's showing you that in situations that come how we have to trust God and how God will make a way where it looks so impossible oh glory to God you're number four and you see only two seats remaining two seats have there and you still have to go because God Will Make A Way God ensure that that party in front they could make it and that made a way for me to make it blessed be the name of the Lord Give the Lord some Praises he would make a way for you Oh Glory to God hallelujah so it's not worldly knowledge it's Heavenly knowledge it's a spiritual knowledge of the word knowing what God Said do what God Said that is right now if somebody tells you I'm going to finish here all right oh no I know realize I'm now five out of 11 just 11 pages but I'm want five if somebody tries to tell you that the Bible has lost it power there's no such a thing as the baptism of the Holy Ghost don't add that am if somebody said he SE in his soul and you know I mean you can Bly ghost and and be lost there's no such thing as ask them if that baptism and his flesh and his soul and his Spirit where the baptism coming from all right so if there somebody said there's no such thing as Holy Ghost don't add that it won't work I said and Paul wasn't one of the 12 that was in the upper room and he had the gift of healing I said look at look at the gift of healing and Plum on 30 years later he was still in Corinthians ordaining the gift of healing into the body of Christ oh my but brandham said this now the bride if the bride in the beginning was the word or the bridegroom and if the bride is taken from the bridegroom it must be the word also the bridegroom watch why must the bridegroom be the word manifested made plain is because the bride and the bridegroom are one she is just a smitten piece off of him the Masterpiece it was smitten and God is going to do it he's going to bring this little bride that's smitten right back to the side of the original word I will restore sayeth the Lord all the years that the pmer and the can all these other things has eaten I'll restore again Malachi for said he restore the hearts of the children and the Fai of the people back to original fathers she is smitten from the church talk about the bride from the church body she is smitten with her master for the same purpose she is the word just as the same as Joseph was smitten from his Brethren because he was the word and Jesus was spitten from his Brethren because he was the word the bride is spinning from the church because she is the word the word living and in action the Bible bride not some man-made bride the Bible bride smitten and Afflicted of God no Beauty we should desire her yet we did esteem her smitten Afflicted of God she stands alone she is smitten from all denominations she is smitten out of L churches and she was raised up in this church was raised up in can't you Pentecostal man see that if that other talk had to die if the Tass die so much the H die stands alone like the bridegroom rejected of men despised rejected of the churches the bright stands as way I talk about the message churches yes sir will reject them the bride because the bride going to be the word manifested the word living not the word tested I know that's not a word but not the word in talk but the word manifested are you with me what is it the Masterpiece again see is the word that he can work through made manifest rejected so now we quoting quotes and prophesying accordion 101 that's we do right now but it going to switch over Oh Glory to God hallelujah when John the Baptist came it was a sign that the Messiah was at hand we didn't know how long the Messiah was coming but John was preaching I'm cutting down a road I'm preparing a way for the Messiah to come the Messiah would be scriptures made manifest when Jesus came and they asked could somebody come and read he step up to read and say the spirit is upon me and say this this script fulfilled then he begin to manifest the word the bride will do the same the bride will pick up a scripture in r 27 the spirit and the bride say come because the bride will become the word that the spirit can mon the bride amen because the spirit will be rested upon the bride upon whom you see the spirit resting and remain that's the bride we're talking about the spirit will come down and remain and what Spirit about charity not brotherly kindness charity you could fail with that but charity never fail it charity comes down upon the bride the bond of perfectness the cement of love to seal the whole thing oh glory to God give the Lord a shout in the house hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah and this is we got the title from now at the Harvest time I'm going to close the seed is back to its original life why why because the Original Seed went down and went to processes and the processes is the church ages seed go down into the ground up come blade tassel and so on and it come back to seed put at the corn you put the corn down and what happen all Sho come out and it grow grow and under the flowers and then you get a corn again in other words the seed go through processes and come back to seedall at Harvest time it's back to the original seed come back to seed Alpha and Omega same thing give the Lord some Praises hallelujah hallelujah are you with me now at the harest time the seed is back to its original life back to the Bible I didn't say it he said it we have to go back to what back to the Bible back to the true Apostolic teaching Oh Glory to God hallelujah back to the apostolic faith back to the true Bible Spirit watch this now and watch something you must have all you must have all the will to be deceived so you cannot reject like how the Pentecost they believe the Bible hit the Malachi for they don't believe that they I send you letter the prophet the message they say they believe but AB Bram hit them the Thunders they pull off of that Thunders is Christ thing the mighty Angel open his mouth and Thunders went out to gather the bright together to give the bright Faith to show to prepare that's the Thunders is all about that's bright business so if they're not preaching the Thunders they're not preaching bright business they're preaching other things all right here we go God bless your heart this is Brother brand I don't believe I won't leave you in that condition I tell you what God Said but I will restore to you all that the coner had eaten all of the P had eaten all the P has eaten I will restore say the Lord so help me butam say I make this prophecy are you ready for the prophecy are you ready before the coming of the Lord the true Apostolic Faith the true Apostolic teaching the true Bible spirit it's on its road now trying to eat its way up and grow out again it's going to be restored oh give the Lord a shouting out that where I get a title from before the coming of the Lord it will have what what will it have the true Apostolic Faith the true Apostolic teaching the true Bible Spirit Oh Glory to God hallelujah then the Pentecostal had it to start with what did they do draw a little ring around it and begin to denominate watch they keep coming they want me that Lin outpour make an organization out of that they want me to come and join the assemblies I stood right in the midst of every Branch hanging out there and I saying this is the foundation cut off these Old Rag lines here so the life can get into you then you will have prophecies then you'll have discernment then you'll have the spirit then you'll have the power you'll have the restoration of the true church when you get back to the True Vine and the true life Oh Glory to God so the word become like a hull through which the spirit could go through so God couldn't let the spirit flow because the word was disconnected there was no channel of the word because the Lord was cut up in Seven Ages misplaced through Seven Ages divided through seven ages and brother Ram come like a plumber and connect all together and tie the word back together into the word that the the spirit now have a line to flow through and God take the word brother George and put it in men because the secret is the word is in the bride so he put it in men and begin to flow true the word in men that's the fold Ministry oh give the Lord a shout he put the pastor word in the pastor and flow through the word of the pastor and then you see the pastor in operation oh give the Lord some Praises do you understand that when he say I sat in the church pastor and teacher that's a word now Pastor is a word now that word comes into the man and God begin to go through that word so he's not using the man he using the word in the man the Pentecostal Hallelujah he was using the men and they were backsliding adultery fornication all kind of life but now he's not doing that he's doing the word in the man that's why when the word begin to work through the man it will be rejected oh give the Lord I shout that's Joseph Perfection the Capstone word rejected oh give the Lord a shout in the house oh Hallelujah that's the rainbow quote word rejected God bless you friends I know you think I'm a little bit noisy a little out of order but I'm not I think I'm in the order with this word the spirit of God is here the same spirit that wrote the Bible and if the spirit that wrote the Bible will say Amen every time the Bible word is spoke and if that is the true spirit of God then the true powers and manifestation of the spirit will manifest itself with this true spirit amen judge ye the word what you hear judge it by the Bible watch its actions watch its work I'm going to close please but Bram we will always judge you talk about uh I want to all right he said he says talk about a good thing for minister to follow right we have an order from God is for the Discerning of spirits and he said trying the spirit I believe that this is a very great lesson for the church is to try the spirit of anything of have discernment of spirit I do not think that we should ever by any means try to judge a person by the denomination they belong to or what group they assemble with whether they be Methodist Baptist Presbyterian Pentecostal we should never judge a man by the denomination that he belongs to they don't do that in the mage message they want to know where you going to church and based upon where you say go to church they have their own opinions they judg it by that he said don't do that do you hear that the prophet say here they not what they're doing but the prophet say here brother don't do that we should always judge him by the spirit he has don't judge them by what church you go to you know the pastor could be a rascal and a cook and a cuckoo no judge the person by the spirit that they have whether he's latter rain former rain inner rain outter rain nor rain Doctrine whatever it might be we should never judge him by that but by his Spirit we have to discern Spirits watch what the man has in mind what he's trying to achieve if the man by a gift no matter how great the gift is there are so many days things we liveing put the gifts so many people judge me by gifts that they have and I believe that these are gifts I believe what takes place god-given gifts now if we do not use them in the right way that God intended them to be used we do more harm with the gifts than we could if we had didn't have gifts the other night I made a statement at the pulpit saying I'd rather see Brotherly Love existing among the church if we didn't have one case of healing we must know what these things are for I rather have a church that so in love with each other and with Christ I rather have that than every spiritual gift of preach in the church now that might sound hard among a Pentecostal group where they are gifts they can fail where there are gifts there'll be in confusion where they are gifts they can be questioned where where there's love is perfect and if you have perfect love you would have perfect gifts oh that's beautiful so he's bringing it out of the Pentecostal realm and that the realm that God bringeth in the message after he set the five for Ministry he sets under there the gifts but that means charity is there then to govern the gifts so if you had perfect love Lov you would have perfect gifts so work with love Lov and that brings fellowship and fellowship bring gifts what brings Fellowship love what brings Fellowship not Doctrine love Doctrine do bring argument love brings real Fellowship now if a man comes at a great gift almost finished no matter if he belongs to our denomination another denomination don't judge him by the comes from how he dresses but what you want to see is what is he trying to do with that gift what's the purpose he has if he's trying to take his influence and build it and himself a great name out of it I have discernment of spirit to know that's wrong once you see flesh beef on Parade wrong no matter how great a teacher he is he know every mystery hidden Myster to that mystery and that com that he combo watch this now how powerful he is how intellectual he is how his gift operates if he isn't trying to achieve something for the benefit of the body of Christ your own personal discernment your own spiritual discernment would tell you that's wrong no matter how accurate the man on point take the point and put the point aside how perfect how it is it's wrong if it isn't used for the body of Jesus Christ so when you're here you see what we have trouble it doesn't have what we have and they don't have what we have it doesn't have that all right to achieve something almost done we are nine 11 maybe he's got a great gift that he could draw people together with great intellectual or spiritual power that could draw people together maybe he's trying to take that gift and make himself famous so you have a big name so others look up to him that say looking for the salute as some big person then that's wrong maybe he's trying to edify a certain thing here that he wants everybody else to get out of the picture and let him and his group be in the picture that is still wrong so trying to wipe out everybody else and say well a subtle thing to do you know paint that picture you know when you're painting the sa mind the says no we alone have it that is it how they deceived in their own head and mind if he has a gift of God and he's trying to edify the body of Christ then I don't care what he belongs to you are not Discerning the man you are Discerning the spirit the life that's in the man and that is what God told us to do not one time was we ever commissioned to discern the man's group but we are constrained and commanded by God to discern the spirit and the man what he's trying to do what the spirit in his life is trying to lead him and then
