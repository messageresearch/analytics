pastor already give you that update we want to go straight into the word this morning we greet you in jesus name it's good to be here well eternal bibles to exodus chapter 23 i want to read from verse 20 to 33 joshua chapter 14 one verse verse 12 judges chapter 1 28-34 and we go back and read verse 20. exodus chapter 23. behold i sent an angel before thee to keep me in the way and to bring thee into the place which i have prepared be way of him obey his voice provoke him not for he will not pardon your transgression for my name is in him but if thou shalt indeed obey his voice and do all that i speak i will be an enemy unto that enemies and an adversary unto thine adversaries for my angels shall go before thee and bring thee unto the amorites the hittites the parasites the canaanites hivites jebusites and i will cut them off thou shalt not bow to their gods nor serve them nor do after their works but thou shalt utterly overthrow them and quite break down their images for ye shall serve the lord your god he shall bless thy bread thy water and i will take away sickness away from the midst of thee they shall nothing cast their young nor be barren in thy land the number of thy days i will fulfill i will send my fear before thee and will destroy all the people to whom thou shalt come i will make all nine enemies turn their backs onto thee i will send hornets before thee we shall drive out the hivites the canaanite the hittite and before thee and i will not drive them out from the before the in one year lease the land become desolate and the beasts of the field multiply against thee by little and little i will drive them out from before they until they'll be increased and inherit the land hallelujah praise god and i will set thy bones from the red sea even under the sea of the philistines and from the desert unto the river for i will deliver the inhabitants of the land unto your hand and thou shalt drive them out before thee thou shalt make no covenant with them nor with their gods they shall not dwell in thy land at least they make these sin against me for if thou serve their gods it will surely be a snare unto thee joshua chapter 14 verse 12. this is caleb given his testimony praise be to jesus now therefore give me this mountain dear way of the lord speaking that day for thou who this in that day all the anakims were there and that the cities were great and fenced if so be the lord will be with me then i shall be able to drive them out as the lord said judges chapter 1 we want to go from verse 28. and it came to pass when israel was strong that they put the canaanites the tribute and did not utterly drive them out verse 29 neither did ephraim drive out the canaanites that dwell in giza but the canaanites dwelt in giza among them neither did zebelin drive out the inhabitants of kitran not inhabitants of nahola not the canaanites dwelt among them and became tributaries neither did usher drive all the inhabitants of akko no the inhabitant of zidon no alab no asib no hilab no ethnic nor rehab but the ashlights dwelt among the canaanites and inhabitants of the land but it did not drive them out okay neither did naftali drive all the inhabitants of beshmesh not inhabitants of bananas and he died and he dwelt among the canaanites the inhabitants of the land nevertheless the inhabitants of bashimesh and besanas became tributes unto them and the amorites force the children of dan into the mountains for they would not suffer them to come down to the valley let's go to verse 20. that's the last script you're going to read of that same chapter and they gave hebron unto caleb as moses said and he expelled against the three sons of enoch let's borrow his heavenly father we thank you for your word may you come and interpret into our hearts may this be a transformational service lord that no one will leave here the same way they came if the tongue made the leave up if they came sick when they leave heal if they came broken may you bind the broken hearted if the lay down out may you strengthen the feeble knees if they need encouragement bring that encouragement to them refine the saints lord quicken the people to the word of god if they're sinners or omits may they be saved backsliders may they be restored in jesus name we ask it amen you may be seated give the lord a shout as you take your seeds oh glory hallelujah [Applause] who praised god hallelujah what a scripted reader okay number 13 the people bought the report after the spies were sent out to bring back a report and they said they told him we came onto the land where did all sentences and surely it flew it with milk and honey and this is the fruit of it nevertheless the people are strong that dwell in the land and the cities are walled and very great moreover we saw the churn of anak there the americas dwell in the land of the salt the hittites jebusites amorites dwell in the mountains kill the nightstand by the sea and by the coast of jordan that was the report they say yes land is good it is nice it is wonderful but it's just that it have giants in that land and caleb still the people before moses and said let us go up at once and possess it for we are well able to overcome it that's my inspiration this morning we are well able to overcome it and my title is drive them out praise god but that's what we come to do this morning we come to drive them out i don't care even in the home if in your heart if it's in your life if it's in your body if it's in sickness i don't care what disease i don't care what condition i became what demon power be i had to drag them out [Applause] hallelujah i'm caleb said if the lord be with me i shall be able to drive them out we had to drive them out we are going to accept living with no canaanite living with no jebusite living with no hit height zebulun didn't drive them out but caleb expel the sons of enoch there are going to be some sons of god oh hallelujah called to drive these demons out hallelujah praise god praise god let me be seated i appreciate the message but isaac spoke before you left the unfolding of the bride praise god but i answered it when it dies they're bringing forth fruit much fruit but the world john beneficies of the resurrection and by the stephen last sunday possessing your individual inheritance and that was such a tremendous blessing to me because that is the word you see god is that coming for church the people are deceived in churches because they think of god coming for a church so they figured in the best group god is not coming from a group there will be one taken and one left that between the field what will be taken while we left so we're not here to talk about that group talk we had to talk about an individual give me my mountain okay the lord i shout in the hole i don't know about you i don't know about you but i come to possess what i know is my own my jesus you may be seated glory to god hallelujah how about you say write the vision make it plain that he has written me run why why why why because the vision is for appointed time so you wouldn't get frustrated you wouldn't get fed up you will not why the lord ain't come yet no no no the vision is for appointed time and when you catch the vision you should wait on it i will wait till my change come oh give the lord a shout in the hope the vision itself is for an appointed time oh hallelujah glory to god abraham waited 25 years to see isaac come forth noah waited 120 years to see the rain fall generally israel waited for 100 years before the liver come but god can't lie god is not a man if god say you're gonna be delivered there's no devil in hell to stop that deliverance i'm coming and i feel somebody gonna be delivered inside this very day this very morning [Applause] not coming for church coming for individuals isn't that right it's an individual's going to catch revelation and efficiency revelation is done right abraham faith isaac love jacob grace joseph perfection god working his way out is not right so this vision of god this prophetic vision that was loosed by seven seals and seven thunders produce the spirit of prophecy because once you see the vision then you know you could prophesy because the vision can't lie abraham could say isaac is coming there is no evidence there is no witness but isaac's still coming because god gave a vision and he had a revelation that put him on expectation and a spirit of worship that he's targeted not at the promise of god through unbelief but was strong in faith giving glory to god you can't have faith and you can't worship faith must have worship with it you could never have faith and you're dumb and you're dead no no faith is already a substance faith is something you can't show anyone faith is revealed [Applause] do i hear a shout in the house right now god is healing you my god my god we don't have a dead message this message is real [Applause] let me seated hallelujah the only way abel could do different and cain is because it was revealed to him it was a divine revelation to evil abel offered unto god a more excellent sacrifice and that's why jesus come and say who do men say either son of man some say you're this some say you're that some say you're that opinions men thoughts he said who do you say i am and peter break out and say don't worry the christ and jesus flesh and blood have not revealed this unto you but my father in heaven revealed this god could reveal himself to a drunkard to a murderer to a backslider to a hater that drug pusher it doesn't matter what condition him somebody remain scared some are prostitute god is suffering god reveals to whomsoever he will and if god is sovereign he could sufferingly deliver you this morning i don't care if he was boozing last night and piping coke there before it matters not when you overcome your outcome my god when the hour for your healing come the hour for your healing come when you're all for deliverance come your hour for deliverance come on you may be seated praise god for 400 years between malachi and matthew no prophet no messenger just priests tradition pots and pans everybody's seeing pharisees and scribes and sadducees and this is how we just do it here and god loose a man named john the baptist not zebekaya not zechariah john the baptist gave him a different name different kind of a man to shake the thing up well i never see it so that's right it's different from everywhere else it has to be different because he's making way for messiah he's making way for dynamics if they can wait for power it's have to be different [Applause] what this message need is a revolution and we're going to have one a seven thunder revolution a revolution of the sons of god fearless men fearless sons be available come on now come on now come on now come on you sons of y'all what are you saying my robin i'm saying that devil in your house when you see leave here peace out in the tremble because you're leaving you with something that devil in your home that devil in your life that going not going you're selling notice all know in the spirit realm angels are being dispatched to come to your assistance because faith is pushing say it is speaking say the same amen fate is worshipping faith is saying hallelujah faith is on the move and god must respond to faith [Applause] listen you don't know how i'm feeling notice jesus never said feel as though this never how you feel it's always believers doubt this the girl is sick somebody come and say don't worry to come she is dead he said i go wake her. in other words you circumstance he flipped the whole thing over you said sick i said sleep come on now you said i said walk you said blind i said see you said dumb i said speak come on i'll give the lord a shout you said bong i set free i'm not hearing you ride with me this morning ride with me this morning that devil have to lose you and let you go oh get the lord and shout in the house [Applause] glory will be caesar so god told daniel seal up the book the book is sealed till the time of the end there is coming a vision to unfold a mystery of that book that book must be unfolded to show you what to reveal you to reveal to you your here we go land of promise [Applause] all joshua and israel was a natural in type to a spiritual land that god promised us so he called him out of egypt like he called us out of the world the journey is not the destination i'm sorry for some of you who expect so much thing in the journey but the journey is to a place you say i'm caring i've taken you to a place that i have prepared you're going to a place along the journey you have this problem that problem but as i say you had to travel from grenada to here to there to get to ivory coast that's what from grenada let's say germany that's not the destination the decisions i recourse but you're flying and stopping different places along the journey of turbulence playing rocking a little bit fasten your seatbelt you have shakes a little bit scary a little bit you land here you get all to pick up your luggages you put it on there that's process but you have a destination destination is ivory coast destination dynamics destination holy ghost land destination revival destination come on now preach back to somebody so all the shakes along the journey don't let it upset you the child of your fate being more precious and cold don't let that shake you don't let child shake you in problem don't let it shake you give the devil romans here 28. for we know all things work together for good remember love god to them that called according to its purpose and the purpose of god must stand [Applause] jesus said in the spirit of jesus come spirit of truth he would lead you and guide you into all truth so the spirit of truth that was to come after the prophet could only speak according to the vision that the prophet bought so there are no new mysteries that any man could bring there are no new mysteries or hidden mysteries every mystery has been revealed it may not be revealed to you or me but it has been revealed to a prophet because the word comes to a prophet no other man can come and claim a mystery that the prophet did not reveal that's false that's contrary every mystery has been revealed scorching a prophet but the mysteries and the mysterious christ to be in you the hope of glory all right so all hell all hell will be against this prophetic vision that is why god hate the nicolaitan spirit he hit ministers taking the place of god playing there the holy ghost hallelujah the holy ghost is a promise to you no no man there any perpetrators of the holy ghost no the holy ghost is your promise i'll be with you but i'll be in you come on say amen somebody [Applause] oh remember this do not forget this when israel asks for a king samuel dropped to the ground don't go there don't ask for that they want the king like other nations i came to go before them a man god is a king will you want refreshing blood for we were human for pillar of fire hanging by night cloud hanging by day he brought you out with a mighty hand we want a man for we are one flesh and blood four [Applause] he told samuel they have not rejected you they rejected me give them what they want you see if you don't want god's perfect will he give you up a missive will and he could bless it in his permissive will too but that is not the bride the bride will have perfect will when i see him god bless you by receiving but he said the church member will not be abducted because the church members and go back up the philistines [Applause] this bride is born to overcome this is the age of overcoming so you are blessed to get the test don't just shake your head so say amen say hallelujah you are blessed to get the test you are honored to be tested [Laughter] he's the best man on the earth i am telling you what inside that man you can change all we think are wrong him don't watch satan's interpretation of joke is he have a hedge around him and that is why he behave in himself you have money of a nice car your family every attack everything nice that is why he's serving god that is why in church god telling the devil that's not why he's in church if you're stripping off his money his car his wealth has helped he will conserve me is not what around him is what's in him my god my god you don't make him refuse to preach what i had to rough things up man to make sure there's nothing connecting to you in you that is a contrary desire you're going to break this and bring this and break your pride and humble you and humiliate you because that's what jesus did he humbled himself and became in the form of a servant and he became obedient to the cross then he said learn of me i'm humble and meek and lowly and hurt there's a spirit of god that dwells in humility that belongs to the first sign of the holy ghost humility that's what's lacking people are too proud and god will show down your kingdom or give the lord some praises whether you say emerald so this messenger of malachi 4 is going to do two things according to malachi 4 he will turn the hearts of return to the fathers then he revealed the mystery of the seven thunders in version 10 which are the revelations contained in the seven seals it will be these here we go divinely revealed not humanly stated and and preached divinely reveal mystery truths is what will literally turn the heart of the children back to the fathers turn it back to the fathers which is another ephesians the promised land so if our understanding is open of this prophetic vision then you will see you belong to that land no pastor no elder no bishop no church could keep you out of it god do have no secretary to pass through give the lord a shout in the house god have sons and daughters that's why god tell joshua listen moses was dead god didn't going to weep in more than oh god mr moses dead god not in that mood god said joshua mold myself it is dead now therefore takes people across jordan it was very simple three things cross jordan fight and divide the land [Applause] very simple the message of the hour is very simple moses is dead no joshua take the people over cross children fight drag them out i'm not hearing you i'm not hearing you some of you looking for god to fight for you [Applause] [Music] on you i give you the land you want me to bring watching cut last you want to bring hoe you're wearing fork you almost are in just to help you cut the grass you don't want to take nothing you just want to just sit down there and relax and i do do all the work for you and say you overcome what there was a land to be taken this land was possessed by seven tribes the tithes jebusites gracious as all the heights plus palestines let me arrange there yet couldn't hit this height and after he couldn't deal with that height them is low-level fellas the philistines that must be dreadlords [Applause] of they iron don't even talk about that yet take adoptions that handle them guys all day but for now we're going to drive out all their might all what we can drive up we're gonna drive them out could somebody say amen could somebody give a shout in the house this messenger of malachi first to do what bring back the original fate and he call it the resurrection fate that the same jesus after he was raised from the dead working among them by the world preacher masterpiece to identify the resurrection ministry of jesus christ among the disciples was not dear easter the lord is among us he's back yeah he is back but that is not your easter easter was pentecost so he came among them show evidence he's alive he'll sit multiply this fish and everything else do miracles for them but it was to give them a faith to go and believe the dynamics in the upper room so testifying we see the lord we see that's great that's a good testament we've seen you know we're saying lord yeah yeah in your room [Applause] but he promises not to be among us his promises to be in you so you can't sit back and say oh we have a wonderful group no no no until this fire come inside of you fight press push until you connected to the actual source god i have no grandchildren god has sons and daughters that's who are here this morning is that right oh my my my lord so therefore what you must see is jesus back among the people since that prophet left so the prophetic vision brings on the fate shows you that the fate has been restored defeat has been revealed the fate must be ripened and the feet must be manifested hallelujah but abandon restore the fate that fate came as a revelation seven seas seven thunders it revealed but that faith must mature ripen hallelujah then manifested not talk not talking-fested manifested not just pulpit eyes peter peter had more than that his his intellectual faith making the united christ his intellectual faith make him run but when holy ghost came upon peter he didn't run he said selman go have i none what am i i could give unto you rise up and walk that was the power we're talking about that's the power to be in sons permanent power resident power not temporary power permanent power resident power that's your promise could i hear the sons of the host amen [Music] [Applause] [Music] believe it or not that's the backdrop [Applause] let's go into the message that's the curtain behind that's the backdrop the prophetic vision revealed the promised land another ephesians the prophet the prophetic vision reveal a holy war of occupation god wants you to occupy the land not run and say die my land you know up that hill there jordan in front of you know but you're using spyglasses god tell joshua are you ready every place you put your foot is yours if you don't put it it's not yours come on now preach back to me somebody every place you put your foot you got to put your foot on your lap [Applause] don't leave the devil on your husband if you don't pray where your eyes open pray when the eyes close don't leave the devil and your wife claim huh don't leave the devil in a chair and claim them [Applause] deliverance has come speak speak speak one of the hardest things is to do something that was never done before that's the hardest change you see if you're custom doing something and a little shift another shift that's easy but when you are challenged to do something you have never done before that is a transformational experience this is what these brothers encountered god promised them a land words is what they're hearing god couldn't wait to bring them up to the land god couldn't wait to send out spice to see it and bring back evidence here one more talk not when you're reaching land you want to bring back evidence of signs wonders miracles powers healings deliverances you want evidence back that's what the grapes represent that's what the wine represents that's what the oil represents that's what the milk represents evidence that god keeps his word the brethren testimony was yes it's true but we see giants we see we see cheering of enoch and this guy is who are gonna expel the the boss man himself and his two brothers so so we see giants and and therefore we we're not able to take it caleb who was the shortest man in the camp but the brother said came up at the staff on a box what a paradox smallest man on a box telling people let's go up at once we are well able to possess it with all them giants and people only watching him and shaking their heads so no i have a thought behind this whole thing let us stand like joshua and kayla you have a choice this morning stand with m10 spies who see and their faith get weak because the challenge is too big my husband is my child this are sick with this and that and all that is all that is all that is the talk it's so giant oh god i have cancer aloo keema i had this i have a tumor i had this case i lost my job i just get fired i'll insure one's up and what that all that is just giants [Music] when you could flatten them giants and pull up we are [Applause] oh give the lord a shout when last time you were shocked when i pitied the shout shout because the lord had given us the victory we are well able [Applause] hallelujah glory to god glory to god this is brother branham you speak about elijah on a juniper tree he was tired he was hungry angel woke him up eat some more because the journey is very hard um is prophesying oh what we need in this journey that we is now is to find a place of rest and to feast on the word of god that it will give us strength he said before there is a great journey and a great battle ahead for the church and i believe we have been children long enough god is going to turn this church into manhood now we have played and followed as children but now we're going to have to put up with childish things and take on manhood maturity who would have thought we will be here almost 50 years since the last has already come long journey her journey and we are feasting on the word with the prophetic vision that the land belongs to us listen if you see that it changes you then you're on your road to possess you could only possess what you know is your own [Applause] you can't claim somebody else's land amen [Music] hear this one and they saw my brother jesus he sent this for me just in time beautiful quote from version chapter 5. you understand now what the seven seal book was what it is we got it in scroll now and just remember in these last days it was kept in an earthling vessel you understand that now who was the earthly vessel jesus christ no man had it nobody had it it's only through him it wasn't even written in the word if it was written in the word it was hidden so you couldn't even find it that's right and if it's in him that's it's revealed then in that earthly vessel it wouldn't rust or rust when he comes he pulls back one to his church so this seven sea scroll book is to be veiled in earthen vessels oh man it has to be veiled behind you so it's a little more than talk right it's a little more than preaching it right it's a little more than explaining it right what it is it has to be veiled in you that's why the prophet has to eat the book it was represented of taking in the word and getting the word on the inside so you have to receive the word and become the word then you fail the word itself because you are the words of the book so you will be veiling the book itself oh glory to god hallelujah remember adam had the book the book had names in it adam was supposed to call the names but adam fell the book went back to god but the book came back down then you like adam god bring back the book to put it back in sons in the last days back on the call names you're going to be born into manifestation oh jesus [Applause] my god help me this morning if you know what i'm seeing this morning i'm seeing beyond your failures be on your sin be on your fault be on your fear i'm seeing sons i'm seeing seeds i'm seeing genes i'm seeing germ i'm seeing what you have to become not what you are oh glory to god help me jesus i want you to see what i'm seeing i could see why the devil fought this prophetic vision because if you catch it you'll begin to fight with all your might you would recognize there's no system longer just taking things for granted you're accepting your sickness you're acting this is the cause and this is how it is lord and no no you stop that start to speak a little thing look look go tell moses bring the people to this place the bush at me right and then they end up with red sea in front of him mountains on both sides hard case moses fall back in humanistic ramp begin to crash under god god say why crimes i mean speaking forward then moses come back in order to say red see you have to move you know [Applause] [Music] now elijah was a little different he was a different kind of a man he had he had to talk he just take his mantle and destroy the jordan river jordan's supposed to understand give me room let me pass i want to pass jordan open up get the lord and shout out that's what we're talking about right now we need a revival right now we i feed the stepper foot on the river stepping foot on signs wonders miracles lay hands upon the section recover speak in the word put your faith on that you have a right to speak just as god spoke remember you see that a woman had a child was sick she was in the in the audience and a woman next to her fellow led to pray for her baby and she prayed for the baby and then one company prayer line or something like that becoming a full story it might be all the details of it and then bahram says a lady next you pray for the baby and baby was healed because god saw that we wanted more compassion and i and god used everyone to pray for the child so the prophet did not pray for the baby a woman ordinary person not pastor wife not bishop wife not elder wife ordinary soul daughter of god with faith good pray and god can answer prayer you to make god to answer your prayer satan trembles when he sees the weakest saint upon them [Music] so many say if the lord will take this evil spirit from me from drinking from gambling from lying or stealing i'll save him that's up to you you have got something to do did i overcome shall inherit all things they are overcome you have power to do it [Applause] see somebody tired and dead let the host catch a fire [Applause] see if they're so tired because you're blocking dead tiredness is relative to the environment that overcome this temptation oh yeah let something else come man you would run like joseph it all depends upon the environment that's why satan has make it nice to william but the wages of sin is still dead that's why the way is narrow and hard and that's the choice we make we choose this rugged way we choose to overcome our own selves we have to there is something called denying yourself that's a word people don't use denying self wife won her own way husband wants his own way everybody no why do you want to deny and just say deny yourself put yourself last night try it out and see how does it work [Applause] people want an eye but god wanted a nice self because that's what christ did he put self aside in order to press forward not my will but i will be done i i wish i could put this aside but there's a cost hallelujah oh my hallelujah so you see god could not push us through a pipe and pull us in the other end and say blessed he will overcome it you have nothing to overcome he just pushed you through but you have got decisions for yourself decisions are beautiful should i shouldn't die should i move toward a lot of fruit is what you see of your decisions so then you are challenged to seek god to make the right decisions because they want the right fruit oh glory to god amen hallelujah god they wanted a king god give them soul so start off nice they always do until pride overtake them then they're going off track isn't that right samuel comes they kill everything kill everything don't even take the flop nothing else come a day and hear britain he said was that a year bleeding he said we keep something for the lord and then king aegon big guy he he covered he feeling safe man samuel draws sword kill ki god i mean it was it was finished because god said don't do it don't touch it i will send a hornet before you i will send my angel before you there you'll be there will be your enemy to be your enemy and your enemy to your enemies as long as you stay with that word [Applause] but israel had always backslide in and anytime your backslide is a king to take you into captivity and when you repent god punish that king so we must know when you repent because you'll come back with the joy and your hands back up in the air when you see you're in trouble hands down [Applause] there's nothing scriptures alone are the four beasts 24 elders no no they will say me amen hallelujah that's that's god is the object of worship that when you could praise him anyhow praise him in any circumstance praise him in a tongue and a timbrel praise him in the dance praise him in the fiery furnace praise him in your heart trial praise him when you don't understand what you're going through [Applause] praise him when you're on the putter spinning wheel and your life is spinning and it's cast up but your shape and he's molding praising when your money going low in your pocket praise him and y'all and everything that i bet praise god let god be a record this morning that your faith is worshiping your faith is present you reject the circumstances i see the air is here listen where are you going what do they do in canaan they were possessing their rights possessing their say rights now watch you could be your father worst child i didn't say you are but when he leave the deed and the will and leave property for you or something for you that is your right brother a b c and d who was the good doers in the house they could say what they want if your father said this is yours that is your right you didn't ask him for it he did it he willed it when jesus died you didn't ask him for it [Applause] he wearing it he did you might be seated so let's say the pr the father have three properties there's three brothers or three sisters property a property b to privacy when you come and head indeed well the rail is red and you was given property see and you said i wasn't worthy i feel so bad the father she said shouldn't i leave that for me are you saying that but you're glad because it was left for you the other two in the family can say none for you they can send none how much they want when you go to the lawyer office you say come um to sign for my rights my father left this to me where do i put my signature your sin that has nothing to do with it you fail that has nothing to do with it you're backslidden that has nothing to do with it where do i sign i want to put my name i want to put my foot i want to rest on what is mines [Applause] so let's eliminate this i'm not worthy and i misbehaved and i acted no forget that don't go there jesus gave bibles to demonstrate how the father sees things he gave the parable of the prodigal son who went and spent all the money he'd pick food and he said i'll rise i'll come back home and the father in the meantime looking out for his son to come back now listen he's that i said but he's a son once a son always a son you will not be denied [Applause] you can't go to heaven's daughter and say i don't know you wants a son always a son you will not be denied so stop high in your head like if you're the worst sinner in tongue you are not okay the lord i shout is there anybody inside this house this morning [Applause] watch they were possessing their rights they could not possess their rights till they got into canaan they didn't own nothing in the wilderness when they come in canaan they had rights and we have got rights but you have to fight for it every inch of ground you have to fight for it when you receive the holy ghost you're in canaan you have to fight for it every inch or wrong you have to fight that's the reason people say brother branham you pray for me today get over in canaan once brother you realize where you belong watch prayer start things you're no no when you get on camera i said wait a minute i didn't know all is his minds healing his minds breakthroughs minds deliverances minds a great primate in his life you know you're going to depressions and frustration and why this happened and why this happened with you all of that because you're hitting online yet when you hit canaan land you can't explain all what happened but you're cutting off depression you're pushing back frustration you're getting the joy of the lord which is your strength you don't have to get a movie to get some joy and then the joy loss no the joy is in the holy ghost you're getting a revival in the word you're getting a revival coming to church you're getting your breakthrough in the kingdom of god o glory to god hallelujah praise god so abraham was heir to all things he could claim to everything and that was the land and abraham had been given a promise and it looked like everything went going wrong for abraham yet he owned the whole thing abraham could possess that land or what was in it god gave it to him and lot was part of that land so abraham had a right to it he could call or lay hold of it listen to this now god made a promise and that was the land and that was mine you made a promise now my kinsmen have been taken and he is gone and abraham i lay a whole of the promise it's my possession you told me so and then you can go after that enemy the devil and slaughter you see many of us don't feel we could go after the enemy you can [Applause] the bible said in my name we shall cast all devils devils are not to be discussed with let's have a discussion um over coffee we have a tea party and we'll discuss this thing no no devils are to be cast out when the devil see you he said he come in let's go they coming that's a church on the moon they're not easy they get a word this morning to drive them out i want you anointed and commissioned to drive out the enemy [Applause] [Music] you have to get a breakthrough right in your home yes go back and back him up you can't pray can't get yes they're gonna pray and bust right to you [Music] [Applause] i like what god is doing though moses run from egypt take a photo break and god pack him up and send him straight back to you same place you run from the same place you're running from go go seniority back there to deal with the enemy and all you have to tell yourself to every goliath there is a divot oh let's change it this way to every goliath there's a stone so once you know good luck his family say enoch he's same family it's all lemon and giant thing but steam stone once there's a giant he could be conquered we have no reason to don't anymore i don't care for a giant as cancer tumor leukemia i don't care what condition it is it could be conquered i gave a shadow of death hanging over you no that could roll back hallelujah is that one time a man a man god said protect your papers time up for you and that man stayed before god and said god i serve you all these years i need more time and god give him more time that can all could be conquered oh my my my i call you young man because you're strong don't ever let the devil tell you you're weak he called because you have a strength as a young person to stand and withstand the devil come on say i met somebody what abraham says we are heir to every spiritual blessing abram had a right to the promise the promise was his and yet he had to fight to possess it there you are believer today we're here to all things yet we are heir to every spiritual blessing every physical blessing every blessing the bible promises yet you have to fight every inch of it that's the way god get it set up character is not a victory character is not a gift rather character is a victory and a victory is something that you have overcome and i see over the years i've never seen my blessings give people character does all mean pain suffering anguish hurts this is what forms you into the image of god i have seen blessings destroy people because it wasn't even repaired for it amen hallelujah that's why god could have blessed solomon with riches in him because solomon acts for wisdom he didn't accept yes he has a wisdom to govern god's people and because he asked for that god could well put wealth on him because you have the wisdom to manage it [Applause] sometimes when blessings come too fast and too much people go wrong because your human spirit cannot handle it like a brother says something in the middle was so powerful he said i don't want to know your weakness because i don't know how i could handle it i don't want to dig up and file where you do wrong and go wrong and no i want to know that you say because god know your weakness i need his attitude towards he doesn't change his nature towards you doesn't change but as a human we could change we could feel this way and feel that way but when god sees you he looks beyond your faults he looks beyond your weakness he looked beyond your struggle when god saw saul new testament saw god saw him becoming paul he was riding his high horse fighting the church killing battling all unbelievers running from saul and god see paul coming but he riding us all right in his high horse god knock him off his high horse who i thought lord who would have taught saul what's going to become paul we write off the man called saul because he fight in the church but god didn't write them off there's a real difference between opinion and judgment you can have an opinion about somebody that's fear that's fine with more information your opinion could change i didn't know this i don't have new information my opinion changed that person but when you judge somebody you put them in concrete there's nothing they could do because you have them fixed they could smile you still don't like them they can bring a gift for you with bow tie you still don't like them because you have an opinion and a judgment on that person thank god he's not like that [Applause] he said peter you deny me but after you're converted strengthening brethren peter did everyone want to sit for like wheat he could tell what could have happened he could tell where you're going to fail but he could tell when he would be restored tell you when you're gonna bounce back tell where you're gonna stand he can tell all about you he still choose you that's why you should be rejoicing you should be thanking god no god wants you to possess your land no no i'm skipping yours jumping here listen to this version 10 christ mighty angel russian 10 7 the messenger represents them three and four seven thunders after the voices the message by russian 10 8 11. john represented the bride said take the book eat the book though must prophesy again why should we have to prophesy because the time is not yet and the vision is from appointed time then you have to get the spirit of prophecy to prophesy over your own life david said the lord will perfect that which considered me you have to connect with the prophecy your own prophecy to step into your position because you have to be a heart of the children who turn hearts back to the faith of the fathers you have to connect with your prophecy the spirit and the bride said come this is you he shall turn the half of the children back to the faith of the fathers peter waiting on you paul written on you we have to go back and pick up what they had and go further than them we have to bring up the resurrection because they without us not made perfect we have to go and pick up what they had and go beyond them we are called to go beyond where any other people went before think about it north korea have their nuclear thing america feeling this way bombs threats the world is going crazy i miss all of that god is still not the heat but our bride has to be ready before anything take place the bride has to be ready and the bible said his wife had made herself ready that means she have done something about the clothes of the world she had just said she make herself ready look this morning thousands and tons of people in churches sitting enjoying our service enjoying a preacher preaching they love the pastor they love the preacher and whatnot but is adi be me ready if we don't make you ready we have failed if you don't catch the prophetic vision we are failed if i am the vision you have nothing to do just sit down and watch me watch watch your tv like a movie just come and watch but when you understand that the whole creation is grown in travailing for the sons of god to step forward and you are that you are called to that the people that know their god what you know luther didn't know what you know wesley didn't know you who know the whole secret of god because in a prophet anyone you could go back on the age of your messenger with the knowledge that you have of this world therefore to whom much is given much is expected much is required we have a higher order we have a higher calling hallelujah look look look the president of america said he didn't know job was so hard he applied for a job and received a job that he didn't even recognize what what all involved noise he thought it was an easier life in the other easy like before this that's what america have right now that's what they vote for god can i risk that son's coming position and power well well you see they're ready oman is ruling dictatorship and ruled rigor that's why god have to look for sons with character because god can't wait to put his signature to put his ring on his sons in the beginning he was proud of adam you know he's saying he's turning his back man let us make man in our own image and likeness let him have dominion when he put adam he walked away oh hallelujah the bible said and he saw it was good god didn't get a fight oh gosh homicide acting like me no a son reflecting the fathers adam was just like god god even tell adam to name the animals and the bible said whatever the name was that was the name thereof adam was authorized authorized to name the animals adam was had full dominion on the earth he had the book he had the authority he had the power but there was war in heaven [Applause] and satan got kicked out and the battle of angels became the battle of men oh hallelujah so that battle fell on the earth and tonight we're in a great battle but we have a word drive them out and if michael take out lucifer out of heavenly places what do you think we gonna do here on the earth think about it he was kicked out in heaven what are we gonna do here we're gonna do the same drive them out oh glory to god hallelujah praise god glory hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah thank you jesus abraham says tell satan give it back give it back with his mind don't let him bluff you stand right there and say he'll give it back but you have to believe in your authority not power yet authority when a policeman go out on the road and stop the trafficking power to stop no traffic that guy could knock him straight down and get control driving but what the respect is the uniform because he had backings the whole action that police force they hold the authority the whole legal system is behind that policeman so he can be small he could be a new recruit and he's looked in and fresh you know how this look already everything looking heavy on them looking like they overloaded and he could be thin as they haven't come and do so you have to stop it's not how tinny is so you could be a teen believer i'm not much physically thin in spirit but once you have the uniform authority authority so from the day today we're going to exercise authority but power coming just stop the car do you understand what i'm saying right now you're exercising authority but power coming stop devils cast every soul heal the sick that's power raise the that's power you will be seated that's power language is dead we have you laid him even now lord power where have you lead him lazarus comfort that's power hallelujah praise god praise god and there's a scripture after lazarus here from the dead describing pharisees plotted to kill lazarus you know yes there's a scripture they say this is too much now mind reason you didn't have to treat it the whole world go off this man called jesus let me kill lazarus you're going to kill the man who was dead let me kill him again so when they recognize he kept all the bag everywhere you know what lies right now they say you know what let me go after jesus oh hallelujah you think the devil will just let you just go just easy just like that even phil changes his mind you know say take your clubs take your thing and go and go and take your place and go and they're leaving and they're very scratching it until god are we gonna look oh my god everyday let's go see me how are we supposed to feel i'm feeling bad who build my cities you say no what let me go after them that's what god wanted because wanting to deal with them they don't understand that let that enemy come against you they come after you playing fresh not after this morning when the angel of the lord and camp are wrong goes that thing not after this morning this after this morning you've got to understand angels have been dispatched to assist you in your warfare i will send my angel before you [Applause] oh glory hallelujah the prime minister doesn't come out just like that i just dropping i can't take a try and go and drive you have escorts you have blue lights you have police in front and polition motorbike and whatnot why because of his office because of his position and when the church finds his place in christ because of your position oh no devil they never ever get permission to approach you because angels are there to protect you because you have a destination you have a purpose in your system like duck your ordained head for the water you have a purpose to manifest the sons of god or money for saying something you have to come to manifestation do you believe that oh glory to god hallelujah praise god praise god hallelujah oh my god so many people i listen to enticing spirits instead of taking the word of god spirits there in the world they are demons and they get into places and they get among men ministers they get amongst church members they get among good people and they cause them to come into an illusion and they say things and do things and teach things and practice things that are contrary to the word of god he called them enticing spirits he said what we need is another pen not not a pentecost but the god of pentecost you're coming to jordan men and women each one of you is coming out to jordan i don't know when that may be in minute before daylight come but there's come at a time when you're going to need more than an old eaten rope of some church you're going to need a god that set that teacher fire in the early days you're going to have to have the vision that they had in the early church hallelujah oh glory to god i could tell somebody that money you need is vision people can have money have no vision the main thing is the vision what do you see son of man what do you see what's what you see god see potential people that sometimes don't even understand what they're looking at why would god leave the pharisees and the scribes who know scriptures to pick up peter fisherman who no cousin i know strong language peter can we read and write but god pick him up because god going beyond head god's seeing what's in our heart god going beyond education god's seeing a vessel that he could just step into it come on now hallelujah god seen a house that he could live in he could walk in he's seen his shoes he could put on a dress he could wear a tie he could put on that's what we're talking about oh glory give the lord i shout hallelujah hallelujah that's why god choose those guys they had the fights they had the pride they had the battle one time they debated who's the greatest who's the greatest she'll bring a little child except you'll be like yeah they become like that little child then jesus bless a kill ball in them he that graves among you let him save for the son of man came not to be served but the son of man kept himself come and wash the feet and say see what i do do for one another who great serve wash one on our feet try to demonstrate leadership by silver silvitude servant leadership he demonstrated it to them he said that gentiles have rulers ruling over them don't do like that if they want to rule silv or could be the last and praises [Music] he is our example he is the example of son he is who we connect with in order to live and operate the life of jesus christ oh my my my my my oh hallelujah oh glory to god glory to god enticing spirit going forth demons under disguises people wondering brother branham how do you let go i've got a lot of people say i'm gonna fast for 40 days so i can do something you don't need a 40-day fast you need to let go of the world and all these devilish things and take god word in your heart you've got to be taught how to do that you don't do it by jumping up and down neither you do buy a 40 day fast you do buy a surrendered heart to almighty god and then he compared to a little baby he said like a little baby i noticed a little baby back there his mother tried to put a little jacket on him this morning and he wanted to get his little arm in the sleeve he couldn't put his arm in there he don't know how you have to guide his little arm he wants to get his arm in there but he's beaten all around he will never get the sleeve he knows not how to get in the sleeve so that is what you are you are not right with god when you are back biting lying doing everything you can't be right with god i don't care how much teachers you belong to until your soul becomes converted that's old-fashioned that's that's that's boiled down and put soup in your soul watch until you could he's got to have somebody direct him and that's the way it is every born-again christian when he really gets into god he watches his life with god's word and he realizes he's lined up with every bit of it he's got long suffering gentleness quietness meekness power faith love joy peace he impossible like the troublesome amen hallelujah praise god his thoughts are pure his heart is pure his intentions are pure his alternatives are right and he knows he's lying with the word of god hell can't move him he's lined up with the word of god he's got divine love puting heart for every man and every woman he's abstained from the things of the world they're dead to him he don't want them no more enticing spirits versus the word of god how do you do it brother branham just let go all you have to do take god's word don't try to work up nothing don't get out of the water and beat another lord give me the holy ghost give me the holy ghost he ain't coming with you beaten on the altar that don't do no good he said it's taken him at his word now here we go i want to get to this part look at peter peter is in trouble look like he's going to die and he's in the lord walking on the water he said lord if that's you bid me to come the lord said come on now if peter said wait a minute lord let me gonna fall to the first to see if i can walk on the water i like this so peter said lord you got the bread no no no lord that you beat me to come he said come peter step one come on peter responded and walk on the water no faulty day first no i had to have to take my time but no no you just acted on what god said oh lord let me get enough spirit on me that i can dance in the spirit and speak in tongues then i can step out so peter didn't do that talking tongues and things step out no there's no need for that he said walk you walk jesus tell a money stretch out your hands the man of the stretch of his hands next time jesus said a man pick up your bell and walk i like that one that i wanted i love that one the man only on on on the couch and he said pick up your bed and walk no no you're hearing that you got to make a channel you're crippled he said pick up your bed and walk you're out of tune how did you turn your finger you're more tuning and afterwards you recognize you're getting up then you pick up your bed and walk [Applause] now if you say picker you're gonna walk and you say lord i don't know man to pick them up you're in trouble you say you need a man to pick you up he said pick up your bed amen one woman take her coach she was crippled she laid a kitchen from her anointed in prayer and said don't the spirit come out and she just woke up the next woman was crippled with clutches came up to the platformer brother branham and when he covered she had him the crutches and walked back off no prayer needed you didn't get that when faith is present prayer not even needed notice the woman with the blood issue she said if i could just touch the hem of his garment she asked for prayer you know she said if i could touch and god set it up that the they crowded around jesus so she have a choice to go back home and change her mind and say well if i could you know see him but she decides she said touch and she going untouched the crowd didn't matter because she spoke a word so she had to push now and press now and fight now and because them fellas were watching wrong jesus they're not then they don't fit them come to see things they come because they have no other place to go they come because there's no drama around jesus so they just they like this supporting boat but she's a star she comes because she have a need and she is pressing away if i could touch this morning i wouldn't leave it the same way my home will not be the same way my life will not be the same way and she pushed and touched and was healed and jesus said who touched my clothes i felt a power left me oh glory to god hallelujah couldn't take a little more what if moses had said moses gone to egypt and said let my people go what did moses say let me go to what did they fast first and see if i got fit enough to obey you god moses never actually questions he just took god under his hood and took off hallelujah and that's the way you have to do it take god at his word i don't care what happened last night yesterday last week last

fight accept it no matter how you feel how you feel don't wait till prayer starts accept it now if you can't move your foot but you find your movie at all that's all you need right now little by
