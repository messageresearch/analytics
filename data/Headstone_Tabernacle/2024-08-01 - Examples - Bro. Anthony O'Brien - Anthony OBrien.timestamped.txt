[28:25] tonight and greet you in the precious
[28:27] name of Jesus Jesus
[28:29] Christ just a one portion of scripture
[28:32] we want to read in here 1 Corinthians 10
[28:34] and verse
[28:36] 6 and it says now these things were our
[28:40] examples to the intent uh that we should
[28:44] not lust after evil things as they also
[28:49] lusted amen let's bow our heads for word
[28:52] of
[28:53] prayer almighty God we thank you to be
[28:57] in your presence father father Lord we
[28:59] thank you Lord that at your feet we can
[29:02] gather Lord feel your presence and be
[29:06] taught by you tonight and to learn of
[29:09] you Lord father it is a privilege Lord
[29:12] father that Lord uh is more than we
[29:15] could talk about and so Lord for a few
[29:17] moments as we get ready to uh enjoy the
[29:20] word portion of this uh of the service
[29:22] we pray that your holy spirit will come
[29:24] down and meet us father and help us Lord
[29:27] God
[29:28] give us strength for the journey Lord
[29:30] father equip us Lord father with tools
[29:33] Lord uh in this scripture Lord that you
[29:36] could help us with life and all the
[29:38] things that we have to to deal with Lord
[29:41] and the road ahead Lord You're the god
[29:43] of wisdom Lord father there's there's no
[29:45] end to your understanding and so father
[29:47] we just open our hearts and our minds to
[29:49] receive you tonight and I pray that you
[29:51] take this thought that I have tonight
[29:53] Lord and may help us along the way Lord
[29:56] I surrender to you Lord Lord we
[29:58] surrender to you tonight father we just
[30:00] pray that you just come and anoint the
[30:02] scripture in your own wonderful way
[30:05] father Lord we surrender now and pray
[30:07] for a few moments that you just uh
[30:10] anoint us with your presence as we as we
[30:13] Feast on your word uh granted almighty
[30:15] God we pray and ask in Jesus name amen
[30:18] and amen you may have your seats
[30:32] praise
[30:33] God it's certainly a privilege to be
[30:35] here tonight and uh it's always a
[30:38] privilege to be in the house of God uh
[30:41] we see the pages of time moving uh in a
[30:44] very interesting way as the year closes
[30:47] and uh we know that God is still in
[30:50] control uh but prophecy must also be
[30:53] fulfilled amen uh but before the end
[30:56] could come uh this gospel must be
[30:59] preached uh into all the world as a
[31:02] witness and then the end shall come uh
[31:05] so we're not too bothered about the evil
[31:07] signs we know that those things will
[31:09] happen um but we know that God promised
[31:12] to pour out his Spirit upon the church
[31:14] in the last day and that's what we're
[31:16] here for tonight amen I have a title uh
[31:20] for this portion of service tonight and
[31:23] God will help us by the way to unfold
[31:26] this as we go along my thought tonight
[31:30] is
[31:31] examples that's my title
[31:33] tonight examples and the scriptures we
[31:37] read 1 Corinthians 10 and verse 6 and I
[31:40] want to read it in the amplifi just to
[31:42] get a make expanded version of it it
[31:45] says with now these things the warnings
[31:48] and
[31:49] admonitions that took place as examples
[31:53] for us that we should not crave evil
[31:57] things as they did that's the example uh
[32:00] the Amplified version of that scripture
[32:03] we just
[32:04] read and so it's an interesting thought
[32:07] and we just wanted to zoom in on this
[32:09] word
[32:11] examples and an example simply put is a
[32:16] reference point isn't that right it's a
[32:19] it's a point of
[32:21] reference uh when we look at an example
[32:23] of something it helps us to make the
[32:26] picture of what we're trying trying to
[32:28] talk about or what we're trying to
[32:31] convey a little more clearer to the
[32:34] person who's meant to receive the
[32:36] message you know the challenge of
[32:38] sending a message is UN whether the
[32:41] recipient of that message is going to
[32:44] get the message the way that they're
[32:46] meant to get it so sometimes to make
[32:49] that message more clear it's good to
[32:53] have an
[32:54] example uh something you could point at
[32:58] something that you could show that helps
[33:00] convey the message and make it more
[33:03] clear uh it's one way it's one it's good
[33:06] to use words but it's it's also good to
[33:09] have something even tangible in front of
[33:12] you that you could see and point at and
[33:15] say here's an example uh and I genuinely
[33:19] believe tonight that that is what all
[33:22] this word and God sending us a prophet
[33:25] in the last days uh was all about
[33:29] because we are supposed to be living
[33:32] examples of what God Said would hap
[33:35] happen in the last days uh I genu
[33:38] believe that God is going to raise up a
[33:40] group of people that are going to be
[33:42] living examples that are going to be
[33:45] living testimonies that are going to be
[33:49] written Epistles read of all men so that
[33:53] people could take note and the whole
[33:56] purpose of God being able to say here is
[33:59] my beloved Son or here is my beloved
[34:03] daughter in whom I am well pleased hear
[34:06] ye him or hear ye her what is God really
[34:10] saying in other words here is an example
[34:14] of what I was talking about you heard
[34:16] about sons of God being raised up in the
[34:18] last days but God wants to be able to
[34:21] point his finger at somebody in the last
[34:25] days and say here is an example
[34:28] of living right here is an example of
[34:31] somebody who pressed through here is an
[34:34] example of someone who prays here is an
[34:38] example of a Christian Life I believe
[34:41] God tonight is trying to raise up living
[34:44] examples oh Halle in this last days oh
[34:48] hallelujah hallelujah of here's my
[34:50] spirit flowing freely God wants someone
[34:53] so Anointed with the presence of God
[34:56] that they could live their lives and as
[34:58] an example of how it means to live a
[35:01] Christian Life what it means to walk a
[35:03] Christian way what it means to say no to
[35:06] the devil what it means to receive the
[35:09] Holy Ghost what it means to have a life
[35:12] that is so influenced by the scripture
[35:14] what it means to have a life oh somebody
[35:17] help me tonight what it means to have a
[35:19] life that is so influenced by the
[35:21] spirits that you become a living example
[35:25] a written epistle a walking testimony a
[35:29] walking pyramid of here is my spirit
[35:34] flowing freely here's another one over
[35:37] there here's this one over there I can
[35:40] touch him I can place her God wants
[35:44] tonight living examples oh somebody help
[35:47] me praise him oh
[35:51] Hallelujah glory to
[35:54] godall so an example is a reference
[35:56] point
[35:58] it can be used as an illustration
[36:00] Hallelujah that we can use to carry over
[36:03] a teaching or a principle that we are
[36:06] trying to communicate or Express and God
[36:11] has many things that he's been trying to
[36:13] communicate and express to us through
[36:16] his word and you know we have the
[36:19] written word but now what we needed was
[36:22] an expression of that word to make it
[36:25] real to make it alive to have skin on it
[36:29] and that's why the word became flesh and
[36:33] dwelt among us we beheld his glory the
[36:36] glory is of the only begotten of the
[36:38] father because yes the Pharisees and the
[36:41] Sadducees had the written word h but
[36:43] here was the Living Word expressed oh
[36:46] Hallelujah isn't that right walking
[36:48] among them Healing The Sick raising the
[36:51] dead casting out Devils he was living
[36:55] something among them he was an example
[36:58] oh that they could look at and say there
[37:01] goes one oh that the spirit is following
[37:05] oh hallelujah hallelujah isn't that
[37:09] right so it can be used as a benchmark
[37:12] talking about examples right a standard
[37:15] that can be set you could use an example
[37:17] as a standard that's right that's right
[37:19] yeah setting an example in other words
[37:22] so if God give example of how we want to
[37:24] do a certain thing or he wants a certain
[37:26] thing done
[37:28] that becomes the basis by which he will
[37:30] operate the second time because it's
[37:33] based on the example that was shown
[37:35] isn't that right oh the early church
[37:39] that was uh filled with the Holy Ghost
[37:41] Amen in the upper room is an example to
[37:44] us hallelujah because God promised to
[37:47] pour out the spirit again in this end
[37:49] time and we have a book of Acts which is
[37:53] not the Acts of the Apostles in that way
[37:55] but it is the acts of the Holy ghost in
[37:58] the apostles that were positionally
[38:01] placed by fire and that is an example to
[38:05] us tonight of how God wants the church
[38:08] to come back to uh throughout the ages
[38:12] we have fallen away from these great
[38:14] examples and Church begin to organize
[38:17] isn't that right they organize after
[38:19] Wesley they organized after Luther they
[38:22] organized after the Pentecostals raise
[38:25] up but what God wants to come back to
[38:28] what he is longing to come back for is
[38:31] for a church that he has already shown
[38:34] an example of in the book of Acts when
[38:38] this church Rises up there are actually
[38:41] going to be a
[38:43] continuation of the book of Acts in
[38:46] other words what that means is God is
[38:48] going to raise you and I up tonight to
[38:51] be a continuation of the examples that
[38:54] he has set in Scripture of how men were
[38:58] positionally placed by the Holy Ghost
[39:02] and the prophet said when God has set in
[39:06] the church some Apostles some prophets
[39:10] some evangelists some pastors when God
[39:14] releases the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[39:17] when God releases the spirit and
[39:19] positionally places Sons and Daughters
[39:22] of God in these last days they are going
[39:26] to be a
[39:27] continuation they are going to be living
[39:30] examples they are going to be living
[39:32] written Epistles read of all men God
[39:36] wants to make an example out of you here
[39:40] tonight
[39:42] oh can we praise him can we praise him
[39:46] God wants to be able to boast about you
[39:49] tonight and tell the devil look at him
[39:52] look at her nothing against them chose a
[39:55] Perfection upon them it's God in them
[39:59] working there working his way out it was
[40:02] God in you tonight working your way out
[40:04] of every trial working out of your way
[40:07] out of every test working your way out
[40:09] of every storm working your way out of
[40:12] every mind battle something in you just
[40:14] wouldn't give up something in you just
[40:16] wouldn't let go why because you are
[40:19] raised up for such a time as this to be
[40:23] a living example God put something in
[40:26] your all that the devil didn't give and
[40:30] the devil cannot take it away somebody
[40:33] give the Lord a
[40:34] [Applause]
[40:37] shout
[40:39] hallelujah glory to godj so this is the
[40:43] fire us up
[40:44] tonight to let us know that
[40:47] God allowed things to
[40:50] happen all throughout
[40:52] scripture and even in our
[40:55] lives as example
[40:58] to help illustrate the point because
[41:01] it's one thing to see it but it's
[41:04] another thing to experience it to see it
[41:08] tangible to hold it in front of you uh
[41:13] you had to go through
[41:15] stuff God always have his men to go
[41:18] through stuff isn't that right Moses was
[41:23] a great
[41:24] intellectual he was raised up as a
[41:26] prince in the house of Egypt isn't that
[41:28] right he was raised up a certain
[41:31] way but uh God had to beat all that out
[41:35] of him and bring him through God's
[41:39] School of character
[41:42] training only when he experienced God's
[41:45] way could he walk in God's way that's
[41:49] outside of that he was walking in his
[41:51] own way he was walking in Egypt's way he
[41:55] was walking in the way that he was
[41:57] taught by those Egyptian schools but God
[42:01] has his own school
[42:03] tonight God has his own way of doing
[42:06] things God has his own way of making the
[42:09] nails real making the scars real so that
[42:14] when you come through that experience
[42:17] you know where you're standing at you
[42:19] could tell somebody I've been through
[42:21] the fire and I know he is God I've been
[42:26] through the
[42:27] storm and I know he is God because when
[42:32] everything else was Stripped Away God
[42:35] Was Made Real in my prayer he was made
[42:38] real in my
[42:39] testimony oh he's the only thing that
[42:43] I'm chasing after tonight money has
[42:46] failed me popularity has failed me
[42:49] material things has failed me but the
[42:51] word of God can never fail and when
[42:54] everything else Falls away the word of
[42:57] God will still stand it will still be
[43:00] sure oh and we are standing tonight on
[43:04] the word of almighty God he promised to
[43:06] deliver you he promised to restore he
[43:10] promised to make a way he promised to
[43:13] fill you with the baptism of the Holy
[43:16] Ghost and Fire that is not your word
[43:19] that is God's word and we believe God's
[43:22] word tonight oh Hallelujah
[43:28] Hallelujah
[43:30] glory
[43:36] hujus and I can safely say that being 35
[43:39] years
[43:40] old has changed me in a lot of
[43:46] ways I'm not what I was when I was
[43:49] 25 I'm not what I've seen when I was
[43:53] 15 all the things that God allowed me to
[43:56] go through
[43:59] has broken me in some
[44:01] ways shaped me in others and I know it's
[44:04] his predestination for me and I believe
[44:09] you could have the same testimony
[44:11] tonight that God passed you through
[44:14] different trials and situations and
[44:17] storms to make his presence real to you
[44:22] to make his word real to you because
[44:24] it's one thing to talk about God but
[44:27] it's another thing to experience
[44:30] God and because because your praise
[44:33] becomes different when you come to
[44:35] church and you've been through something
[44:39] and somebody sitting next to you hasn't
[44:41] been through something that's all right
[44:44] they're waiting on their shout you
[44:46] already got yours because you went
[44:48] through the trial you went through the
[44:51] storm you went through the depression
[44:55] you went through the frustration and
[44:57] somehow in the midst of all that mess
[45:01] God proved his love to you God opened up
[45:04] his alabat the box for you God showed
[45:07] you who you are that you are a child of
[45:10] the king and that you are his own and
[45:13] that no weapon formed against you could
[45:17] ever Prosper that's why he allow weapons
[45:21] to come against you but he didn't let
[45:23] him Prosper he allowed you to go through
[45:26] trials some through the waters some
[45:29] through the flood some through great
[45:31] trials oh we cried in the night when
[45:35] nobody was watching we cried in a shower
[45:39] how could this happen to me uh yet
[45:41] through it all I learn to trust in Jesus
[45:45] I learn to trust in God because the
[45:48] tears will bring you closer to the
[45:51] shepherd the tears will bring you closer
[45:54] to the master that's why he allowed
[45:58] you to go through
[46:02] stuff to make your Christian
[46:05] experience real to you and I hallu that
[46:08] you know it's not a
[46:10] game you know that if it wasn't for
[46:13] God your story would have been a
[46:15] different story I could have had a
[46:18] really different story but Jesus came
[46:22] down and he broke past he he bur past
[46:26] all my all my thoughts and he saw my
[46:29] needs and he stretched forth his hand to
[46:32] Calvary and pulled me through the myy
[46:35] clay he pulled me up he put my feet on a
[46:39] rock oh some of us here tonight the only
[46:42] reason we are standing is because he
[46:44] pulled us up his strength was perfect in
[46:48] your weakness he reached down and pulled
[46:52] you up out of the Mary clay and he set
[46:55] your foot upon Rock he is the only
[46:58] reason you could come into this church
[47:01] tonight and raise up your hands and give
[47:04] God a shout of praise that's why the
[47:06] devil can't take my praise oh
[47:10] Hallelujah if you haven't been through
[47:12] nothing it's okay you can keep quiet if
[47:15] you haven't been through a trial it's
[47:16] okay you can keep quiet but if you've
[47:18] been through a storm if you know that
[47:21] God you did you know that you know that
[47:23] he's the same yesterday he's the same
[47:26] DayDay he's the same forever if you know
[47:29] that he's a bread on your table the
[47:31] clothes on your back he is the shoes on
[47:34] my feet he put a song in my heart
[47:39] tonight
[47:42] Hall when you go through that and you
[47:45] know that it's
[47:46] real then the devil cannot take it out
[47:49] of you because it doesn't matter how
[47:52] many storms you go through what God put
[47:55] inside of you as an anchor what God put
[47:58] inside of you is a rock it's a rock
[48:00] solid fate that Crips The Rock which is
[48:03] Jesus
[48:06] Christ that rock is
[48:08] Jesus he is the
[48:11] one that rock is
[48:13] Jesus God's only
[48:16] son be very
[48:18] sure that your Anchor
[48:21] Holds and grips the solid rock amen and
[48:25] amen hallelujah hallelujah
[48:27] glory to
[48:30] God so in life and even in the
[48:33] scriptures there are good
[48:35] examples and there are bad examples
[48:38] we're talking about examples tonight
[48:40] right the broad brush spectrum of it
[48:44] examples are
[48:46] examples it's like good and bad
[48:48] hallelujah it's like it's like
[48:51] leadership
[48:53] leadership most of the times we think of
[48:55] leadership as a good thing
[48:57] leading people in a good way but
[48:59] leadership as a broad brush there's good
[49:02] leaders and there's bad leaders it all
[49:05] depends on which way the tree is
[49:07] leaning isn't that right it's just like
[49:11] parenting parenting as a
[49:14] spectrum is what it is it's parenting
[49:17] but there's good parents and there's bad
[49:21] parents and there's no book like brother
[49:24] always to say book book of parenting
[49:28] where you could say we're doing it by
[49:30] this
[49:31] book there's no school that says this is
[49:33] how you're supposed to do
[49:34] it so if that be the case then as
[49:40] Christian parents and as Christian Le
[49:43] leaders we ought to lean on
[49:46] God for wisdom and understanding because
[49:51] God himself is a
[49:53] leader and God himself is a parent
[49:57] God himself is an
[50:00] example he's someone to
[50:05] follow he's a a point of
[50:09] reference he he gives context to life in
[50:12] a way that we would not usually out of
[50:15] had outside of the
[50:17] scripture uh we would do things
[50:19] according to our own mind that's right
[50:21] according to our own
[50:23] Fashions because who we are is how we
[50:27] lead and our environment is a natural
[50:31] reflection of our
[50:33] leadership the environment we create is
[50:36] a reflection of who we are as
[50:40] individuals it's very important your
[50:42] home it's a reflection of of who you are
[50:44] the things around you the things that
[50:47] are in your charge that are in your care
[50:51] that God put into your hands to take
[50:53] care of our reflection of of who you are
[50:58] isn't that right and
[51:01] God Is A Healer Hallelujah and that is a
[51:05] reflection of who he is in other words
[51:08] he's a he is he can heal because he is a
[51:12] Healer he can love because he is love he
[51:17] can help you because he is our help oh
[51:21] isn't that right oh he is a rock for us
[51:24] he is a fortress for us because that's
[51:27] what he is isn't that right Hallelujah
[51:30] and the proof of scripture throughout
[51:33] the Bible as we see God unfolding
[51:36] himself in different ways and in
[51:38] different attributes only gives a
[51:41] reflection of who he is because in him
[51:44] was these attributes uh locked up all
[51:46] the time he was always that but he just
[51:50] didn't have an opportunity to show what
[51:53] he was so that's why he passed through
[51:56] the Wilderness and he he he threw the uh
[52:00] had down at the bitter Waters in memory
[52:02] and so forth like isn't that right and
[52:04] uh told them to hold up the brass
[52:06] serpent with Moses and and and all these
[52:08] things that happened throughout
[52:10] scripture was to show that he was a
[52:12] provider that he could provide that he
[52:15] could restore because he is a restorer
[52:18] he can restore oh hallelujah hallelujah
[52:23] and God wants a bride on the earth
[52:25] tonight that can reflect the same
[52:28] because you can't give it if you don't
[52:30] have it so God found a way through Jesus
[52:34] Christ to bring Perfection to us so that
[52:38] he can get into us this pyramid so that
[52:41] when this is in you you become the
[52:45] scripture and then you could say like
[52:47] Peter Silver and Gold Have I None but
[52:51] such as I have give I unto you because
[52:55] healing was in
[52:57] he could heal the lame man oh Hallelujah
[53:00] because virtue was in him it could flow
[53:02] out of him and touch the lame man and
[53:05] raise him up at his point of need oh God
[53:09] wants to fill you with himself so that
[53:13] all that he is could be inside of you so
[53:16] that when you walk the streets of
[53:19] Trinidad and Tobago all of God would be
[53:23] poured into you tonight that you could
[53:25] be a living expression a living example
[53:30] of God on the earth Healing The Sick
[53:33] raising the dead casting out Devils
[53:37] because if you have the same spirit that
[53:39] Christ had in him when he was on the
[53:42] earth if he heal the sick if you have
[53:45] the same Spirit then you also will heal
[53:48] the sick if he raise the dead then
[53:51] you'll raise the dead because it's the
[53:53] same spirit it's the same life therefore
[53:57] it does the same works oh that he did oh
[54:01] then if he overcame you will overcome
[54:03] somebody give him a shout if he stood
[54:06] the test then you also will stand the
[54:08] test oh and if he came through the
[54:10] Wilderness you're going to come through
[54:12] your Wilderness because greater is he
[54:15] that is in you than he that is in the
[54:18] world oh greater more powerful all the
[54:23] examples he show in the Bible of who he
[54:26] was was will be in the church in the
[54:29] last days the same things that he did
[54:32] the same examples he
[54:34] set Hallelujah because he is the example
[54:38] seed son of the scripture isn't that
[54:41] right hallelujah oh glory to God he said
[54:43] I do nothing thank you unless my father
[54:47] show me first isn't that right so
[54:51] they're good examples and they're bad
[54:52] examples isn't that right Hallelujah
[54:54] isn't that right and so God is a leader
[54:57] and one of the ways he leads is by
[55:00] example it's one of the ways that he
[55:03] leads you know gives examples and I like
[55:06] it because now we have a clear picture
[55:10] of what is expected we have a clear
[55:13] picture of what happens when we do right
[55:17] and what happens when we don't isn't
[55:19] that right and as I like to say in life
[55:22] we're always learning something either
[55:25] we're learning what to do do or we are
[55:27] learning what not to do but at every
[55:30] instance you're always learning
[55:33] something that's the way it is and when
[55:36] we see life as this great school or book
[55:39] of training and learning then I think it
[55:42] changes our perspective begin to
[55:44] appreciate all the things that come upon
[55:48] our doorstep because now we're seeing it
[55:51] as learning opportunities for us to
[55:54] embrace and when even when things don't
[55:57] go the way we expected we can ask God
[56:01] how to go about it how to deal with this
[56:04] and now it provides an opportunity for
[56:07] God to show himself as who he is because
[56:10] when we run out he's just getting
[56:13] started oh and when we can figure out he
[56:16] knows exactly what to do next oh because
[56:19] daddy is just that good at getting
[56:22] things done oh hallelujah hallelujah
[56:25] hallelujah
[56:26] Hallelujah Glory so have you spoken to
[56:29] your daddy yet
[56:31] tonight Daddy
[56:33] knows you know my son the the
[56:36] electricity went out last night and he
[56:38] asked for Titi I said
[56:41] okay so had to go and make the Titi with
[56:44] boiling water and
[56:45] everything and all of a sudden a moth
[56:47] came in the room and started flitting
[56:51] about and started running around and
[56:53] making a lot of noise you know um in the
[56:55] roof in the ceiling
[56:56] and he's like Daddy
[56:58] Daddy Daddy Daddy fix the problem daddy
[57:00] there's a moth you know and he's
[57:02] starting to freak
[57:03] out and now regardless of whether I'm
[57:06] afraid or
[57:08] not I am apparently
[57:12] daddy so so it falls in my lot to
[57:17] address the portfolio of Daddy and uh
[57:20] and get a side of a slipper and do the
[57:24] job you know and it had to be Fairless
[57:26] at the job too cuz this thing is moving
[57:27] really fast you know but it's I just
[57:31] watched it because I was amazed to see
[57:34] you know my son's confidence in
[57:39] Daddy he knew that I could do
[57:45] it that's
[57:47] amazing he didn't know my
[57:49] background he didn't know how I grew up
[57:53] if I could use a sling or not amen he
[57:56] just knew daddy could fix a
[57:58] problem and I genuinely feel like that's
[58:01] what real childlike faith
[58:04] is when we
[58:06] know that Daddy is just that
[58:11] good who my daddy he can fix any problem
[58:16] you bring your problems to Daddy and
[58:18] Daddy's got an answer oh and tonight our
[58:22] Daddy has an answer to every problem to
[58:26] every challenge to every mind battle to
[58:29] every sickness to everything that you
[58:32] are facing in life Daddy's got an answer
[58:36] oh have you spoken to your daddy today
[58:39] glory to go he's waiting to hear from
[58:41] you oh pick up that Royal telephone to
[58:45] glory and talk to your daddy tonight
[58:48] amen amen amen he's waiting With Arms
[58:51] Wide Open No Matter What sin it's as far
[58:55] as he EAS is from the see that's how far
[58:57] he has removed our transgressions from
[59:01] us so that we can come back into contact
[59:05] with our father we can speak to our
[59:07] daddy again amen and amen so he uses
[59:12] examples to teach us and he gives us
[59:14] examples to follow to teach us about his
[59:16] word and so forth amen isn't that
[59:18] right uh yeah so we went through all
[59:21] that amen and he unfolds himself in in
[59:24] others and here's the thing he gives us
[59:28] examples in the form of men and women
[59:32] who have have walked the Earth and
[59:35] throughout the scripture we could see
[59:37] these
[59:39] examples uh as we turn the pages I I
[59:42] find that to be one of the most
[59:44] wonderful things about scripture is that
[59:47] you know scripture the Bible is many
[59:49] things is a book of Prophecy it's a book
[59:50] of inspiration and knowledge and wisdom
[59:54] but one of the things that always blows
[59:56] my mind is that uh the Bible itself is a
[59:59] book of stories stories of men just like
[1:00:03] us women just like us similar challenges
[1:00:08] like us similar situations some of them
[1:00:11] having the same mind battles this they
[1:00:14] felt the same fears that you would have
[1:00:17] felt had you been in that situation and
[1:00:20] yet somehow throughout scripture we
[1:00:22] always see in its unfolding how the
[1:00:26] mystery of God in these people found its
[1:00:30] way out isn't that right it found its
[1:00:33] way out of them that when presented with
[1:00:36] the challenge of the hour something
[1:00:39] inside of them held on to a faith
[1:00:42] something they couldn't see with their
[1:00:44] eyes they weren't trusting in their own
[1:00:46] plan or their own idea they were
[1:00:49] trusting in God's plan they weren't
[1:00:51] trusting in God's idea about it they had
[1:00:54] an interest in what God has to say about
[1:00:56] it they had an interest in God's purpose
[1:00:59] and program and forsaken all else they
[1:01:03] pursued after righteousness forsaken all
[1:01:06] danger and Calamity and and and what
[1:01:10] would happen to them they threw caution
[1:01:12] to the wind at times in order to fulfill
[1:01:15] God's Own word and we could see that
[1:01:17] that is Faith it's only faith that can
[1:01:20] do that when your human reasoning fails
[1:01:24] something else kicks in and says no not
[1:01:27] this time something else kicks in and
[1:01:30] says if I perish I perish but I go in to
[1:01:33] see the king if I die I die oh what kind
[1:01:37] of Faith would do that it's not the
[1:01:40] faith of a man that's the faith of God
[1:01:43] in a woman that's a faith of God in a
[1:01:46] man who says I'll turn aside to see what
[1:01:49] the attraction is on the mountain a
[1:01:52] faith that God put in a man to say I go
[1:01:55] to tell phoh to let my people go that's
[1:01:59] God's faith oh hallelujah hallelujah
[1:02:02] think about yourself tonight what made
[1:02:05] you come here what made you accept the
[1:02:08] gospel what made you want to get saved
[1:02:11] what made you want to get baptized in
[1:02:13] water that's not the faith of a man
[1:02:15] that's the faith that God put inside
[1:02:18] your hearts that God put inside your
[1:02:22] soul to make you stand up and say yes I
[1:02:26] believe I believe every word that is
[1:02:28] written in this scripture I believe the
[1:02:31] words that are written in this book I
[1:02:33] believe that there is a God out there
[1:02:35] somewhere and though I can't see him
[1:02:38] with my hands the faith inside my soul
[1:02:41] says that he is real my faith says amen
[1:02:45] amen to the word amen to his promise
[1:02:51] amen my
[1:02:53] faith is anchored am in the
[1:02:57] Lord my faith brought me to church
[1:03:00] tonight my faith helps me to walk by it
[1:03:04] because I don't walk by sight I don't
[1:03:07] walk by the things that I can see I
[1:03:09] can't even trust my own eyes but I know
[1:03:12] if I hold Daddy's Hand tonight he can
[1:03:15] lead me through the valley he can lead
[1:03:18] me up the mountain he can lead me in the
[1:03:22] darkness because when I can't see no
[1:03:25] more
[1:03:26] he can see very clearly oh Hallelujah
[1:03:29] he's a God that sees oh hallel you may
[1:03:32] not be able to see him tonight but he
[1:03:35] can see you tonight oh hallelujah
[1:03:38] hallelujah
[1:03:40] hallelujah hallelujah he sees you
[1:03:43] tonight and he hears you tonight that's
[1:03:47] why we should have
[1:03:48] confidence when we go to God In Prayer
[1:03:52] cuz we're not praying by what we could
[1:03:53] see with our eyes but our faith is what
[1:03:56] gives us eyes to see the possibility of
[1:04:00] a supernatural God in our lives a
[1:04:03] supernatural God in our walk a
[1:04:05] supernatural God
[1:04:07] intervening when we pray Hallelujah
[1:04:10] prayer is powerful pray is one of the
[1:04:12] greatest weapons that God had give to
[1:04:15] man men ought to pray and not to faint
[1:04:19] oh H isn't that right and even brother
[1:04:22] is talking about many examples in
[1:04:24] scripture about men in the Bible who
[1:04:27] offered a sacrifice and even our
[1:04:29] precious brother Isaac over is talking
[1:04:30] about altars on Sunday appreciate that
[1:04:32] word amen oh wonderful it was so
[1:04:36] timely and you know I was thinking about
[1:04:38] that scripture and I think brother was
[1:04:40] making an example of lot as well I think
[1:04:43] he was one that the Bible rarely ever
[1:04:46] records him offering sacrifice isn't
[1:04:49] that right and uh one of the other
[1:04:51] examples in scripture we could look at
[1:04:53] is also Samson uh Samson lifestyle was a
[1:04:57] kind of loose one isn't that right uh he
[1:05:00] wasn't a very prayerful individual a lot
[1:05:03] of what he did was about his own pride
[1:05:05] and his own testimony and his own
[1:05:08] proving himself isn't that right uh uh
[1:05:11] but it really didn't really glorify God
[1:05:14] in the truest way and uh when you look
[1:05:16] at it it's interesting because he has a
[1:05:19] man with so much promise he is a man
[1:05:22] with so much ability he is a man with so
[1:05:25] much
[1:05:26] physical strength um that seemed very
[1:05:29] impressive to the Natural Eye uh but
[1:05:32] because of a life that was UN prayerful
[1:05:35] uh because of a life that was so loose
[1:05:38] and
[1:05:39] unguarded uh all of that promise that
[1:05:42] was in Samson kind of died away and it's
[1:05:46] only in the end that God is able to
[1:05:48] redeem him when he told that boy to lead
[1:05:52] him to the pillars because he saw a
[1:05:54] possibility that he could somehow redeem
[1:05:57] himself after all that he had failed and
[1:06:00] flopped at uh and we think about that
[1:06:03] because here is an example of how a life
[1:06:06] could have been so different uh had he
[1:06:09] done
[1:06:10] differently had he surrendered more had
[1:06:14] he had not trusted his eyes and followed
[1:06:16] after this woman Delilah uh who
[1:06:19] entreated him and who deceived him into
[1:06:22] getting his haircut and losing his
[1:06:25] Covenant losing his testimony so friends
[1:06:29] it gives us it behooves us tonight to
[1:06:32] have wisdom and righteousness as we look
[1:06:35] through scriptures to see the examples
[1:06:38] that God give by his word and by the
[1:06:41] lives of men and women who come through
[1:06:44] the scriptures from chapter after
[1:06:46] chapter and book after book we can see
[1:06:50] how God used individuals and some of the
[1:06:53] key notes in these examples like
[1:06:56] surrender and prayer uh and humility and
[1:07:01] reverence and sacrifice and a clear
[1:07:05] understanding of God in the in the midst
[1:07:07] of their lives is what led them to make
[1:07:10] better choices than those who fell by
[1:07:13] the way because they couldn't mix the
[1:07:16] word that they were hearing with faith
[1:07:19] in order to receive what God was trying
[1:07:21] to bring them to a land of promise God
[1:07:25] wants to bring you tonight to a land
[1:07:27] flowing with milk and honey he wants to
[1:07:30] bring you into Prosperity Prosperity
[1:07:33] naturally Prosperity spiritually why
[1:07:37] because he wants to make you a living
[1:07:39] example he wants to be able to Point At
[1:07:42] You just like he point at job and say
[1:07:45] look at my man on the earth there's not
[1:07:48] another like him to call the devil and
[1:07:51] say take a look at this one have you
[1:07:54] considered my servant job you see he
[1:07:57] wasn't just any servant it's something
[1:08:00] special when God pointed you and said
[1:08:03] here is my servant he is someone who
[1:08:05] offers sacrifices he is someone who has
[1:08:09] an altar he is someone who has a prayer
[1:08:11] life here's someone who has a testimony
[1:08:14] that he pleased God oh hallelujah
[1:08:18] hallelujah he does something to show the
[1:08:20] faith Hallelujah that he professes to
[1:08:23] have in me Hallelujah there's an action
[1:08:25] be behind every word that he has that
[1:08:28] proves that he's there walking the talk
[1:08:31] amen and it's not just talk but he's
[1:08:34] walking the talk and tonight God wants
[1:08:36] men and women on the earth who could
[1:08:38] walk the talk amen amen can't just be
[1:08:41] all fluff you got to be able to walk in
[1:08:44] a holy way you got to be able to talk
[1:08:46] you got to be able to live it you got to
[1:08:48] be able to isn't that right preach
[1:08:51] it not everyone can stand on the pulpit
[1:08:55] but just says the prophet says you are a
[1:08:57] preacher uh and we are all preaching
[1:09:00] something where by the way we walk by
[1:09:03] the way we live by the way we act by the
[1:09:07] things that we do it creates an
[1:09:09] atmosphere around us words that we speak
[1:09:12] to others and doesn't matter where we
[1:09:15] are uh when we have the wisdom of God
[1:09:18] inside of us and it's really expressing
[1:09:20] itself outwardly um I believe it can
[1:09:23] change any situation the says a kind
[1:09:26] answer can turn away wrath I believe D
[1:09:30] tonight that there is a more excellent
[1:09:32] way and it's up to us tonight in this
[1:09:34] last day to find that excellent way and
[1:09:38] I believe God gives us the tools to find
[1:09:41] an excellent way and how to conduct our
[1:09:44] business and how to conduct our Affairs
[1:09:47] and how to be fathers and how to be
[1:09:49] mothers and how to be husbands and how
[1:09:51] to be wives God wants to equip us and I
[1:09:55] believe that's why he released these
[1:09:56] seven
[1:09:58] spirits excuse me into all the Earth
[1:10:01] seven manifestations of one Holy Spirit
[1:10:05] he released it in the last days to catch
[1:10:08] a brine so that we can live these things
[1:10:13] and be real examples of God on the earth
[1:10:17] that's the whole purpose you see so it
[1:10:20] ought not to be complicated amen but it
[1:10:23] ought to get pler as we see the the day
[1:10:25] approaching amen so God was so
[1:10:27] mysterious he wanted to unfold himself
[1:10:29] in a way that we could understand so he
[1:10:31] give us examples that we could follow in
[1:10:34] scripture and look back at what God has
[1:10:36] done isn't that right and we could use
[1:10:38] them as lessons isn't that right we
[1:10:41] needed an example we needed an example
[1:10:43] of a positionally placed son so what did
[1:10:46] he do he showed Adam in the Garden of
[1:10:49] Eden placed in the Garden of Eden here's
[1:10:51] a perfect example of God's son being
[1:10:54] placed in position isn't that right
[1:10:57] Bible said that God planted a garden
[1:10:59] Eastward called Eden and then he placed
[1:11:03] the man that he had created in that
[1:11:06] garden and plac him positionally in
[1:11:08] there and said Till the soil do the work
[1:11:11] isn't that right until the time will
[1:11:13] come for him to to to get a wife
[1:11:15] afterwards isn't that right and so he
[1:11:17] was placed positionally into that garden
[1:11:20] and here was Adam an example of God's
[1:11:23] original intent for man God used him as
[1:11:27] an example to show what he wanted for
[1:11:31] mankind since the very beginning isn't
[1:11:34] that right he would speak and it would
[1:11:36] create itself just like that he named
[1:11:39] the animals he showed and demonstrated
[1:11:43] before the devil got into the picture uh
[1:11:45] God allowed him to show and demonstrate
[1:11:48] his sunship on the earth for a time and
[1:11:52] a season so that we could have an
[1:11:54] example
[1:11:55] of what Eden condition is so that we
[1:11:58] know that when the prophet came in this
[1:12:01] last day and said little fishy I give
[1:12:04] you your life when he came and spoke and
[1:12:06] said son come out and Shine for 4 days
[1:12:10] we begin to realize that these examples
[1:12:12] that the prophet was even living in his
[1:12:14] time begin to look a little familiar to
[1:12:17] us it looked like something we've seen
[1:12:19] before in Scripture it looked like that
[1:12:22] man Adam when he was here on Earth he
[1:12:24] dis playay that same kind of a power and
[1:12:27] God's going to have a bride on the earth
[1:12:30] who's going to display that same kind of
[1:12:32] a power oh Hallelujah God had an example
[1:12:36] and he's going to have it one more time
[1:12:39] an example on the earth sons of God on
[1:12:41] the earth with spoken word power oh
[1:12:45] they're going to speak oh and the word
[1:12:47] of God will create itself just like that
[1:12:50] oh Hallelujah isn't that right
[1:12:56] just like Adam did Hallelujah God's
[1:12:59] original intent Hallelujah for man's
[1:13:01] existence on earth a time before
[1:13:04] sickness a time before disease before
[1:13:07] pestilence before strife and and enity
[1:13:10] and all these things uh uh there was a
[1:13:13] Peaceable picture uh and God allowed
[1:13:16] that example to flow on for a time and
[1:13:18] season knowing that all this fall would
[1:13:21] take place uh but God would bring us
[1:13:24] back to that picture picture again we
[1:13:26] have that picture in scripture we have
[1:13:29] that example in Scripture that gives us
[1:13:31] faith and it gives us hope to know that
[1:13:34] that picture will return again that
[1:13:37] situation that existed in Eden is going
[1:13:39] to come back again oh Hallelujah and a
[1:13:42] bride on the Earth is going to break in
[1:13:44] to the supernatural break in to her
[1:13:46] Eternal Church age and bring on another
[1:13:49] Eden bring on another Eden condition
[1:13:53] where men are going to walk the earth
[1:13:54] just like Adam did where women are going
[1:13:57] to walk the earth isn't that right holy
[1:13:59] and without Plame before him in love oh
[1:14:03] Hallelujah Hal isn't that right and
[1:14:06] you're going to be living examples isn't
[1:14:07] that right my God my God word became
[1:14:11] flesh in the trip report Prophet said in
[1:14:13] 1954 said what kind of people should we
[1:14:15] be now this was Adam talking about Adam
[1:14:18] and he was living in the spirit isn't
[1:14:20] that right that's right when he was on
[1:14:22] Earth he lived every day in the Spirit
[1:14:26] what a condition always in that realm
[1:14:29] it's only when sin came into the picture
[1:14:32] it changed and then he got cut off from
[1:14:35] that Spirit-filled life but he always
[1:14:38] had it up to a point in time isn't that
[1:14:41] right uh and and here's a prophet
[1:14:43] talking about how we ought to be in this
[1:14:45] kind of atmosphere amen as we see the
[1:14:48] day
[1:14:49] approaching uh paragraph 181 he says
[1:14:51] what kind of people should we be uh if
[1:14:54] the very if the very Holy Spirit has you
[1:14:56] so embodied or empowered that you don't
[1:15:00] use your own thoughts you don't use your
[1:15:03] own mind you don't use your own opinions
[1:15:07] but the Holy Spirit has you so built
[1:15:12] until your thoughts and your being is
[1:15:14] God's spirit expressing itself through
[1:15:18] you he said what kind of a church would
[1:15:21] we be what kind of a people would we be
[1:15:24] this morning and we say here tonight if
[1:15:27] this Bram Tabernacle he said was so
[1:15:29] filled with the presence of God why
[1:15:33] where you don't even use your own mind
[1:15:36] didn't even use your own thoughts didn't
[1:15:39] have no ultimate of your own but just to
[1:15:43] be led by the spirit oh that's the kind
[1:15:47] of church tonight that God's going to
[1:15:49] have in the last days a spirit-led
[1:15:52] church a spirit filled Church church do
[1:15:55] you believe it he said and they that are
[1:15:58] the sons of God are led by the spirit of
[1:16:02] God and then when the human element goes
[1:16:05] out and the spirit of God fills that
[1:16:10] vacancy where you empty yourself oh Hal
[1:16:14] you empty yourself you get all the trash
[1:16:18] out you boil out all the nonsense you
[1:16:21] get out all the idols all the things
[1:16:23] that you put before God God when you get
[1:16:26] that out then the human element goes out
[1:16:30] and then the spirit of God fills that
[1:16:34] vacancy how by the baptism of the Holy
[1:16:36] Ghost the spirit of God is Promised
[1:16:39] tonight to fill that vacancy in your
[1:16:43] heart oh God put a vacancy in there
[1:16:46] nothing in the world can satisfy nothing
[1:16:49] the world can offer can satisfy the
[1:16:52] longing in the hearts and The Thirst
[1:16:54] bursting in the soul for the filling of
[1:16:57] the spirit to fill that human heart
[1:17:00] inside of you oh
[1:17:03] Hallelujah that's what we need
[1:17:06] tonight that's what puts a fire in the
[1:17:09] soul that's what makes you get up in the
[1:17:11] morning it makes you acknowledge God as
[1:17:14] the first thing of your day a living
[1:17:17] presence that keeps you in the time of
[1:17:20] the storm like the prophet said you're
[1:17:22] not a hybrid plant hybrid plants you
[1:17:25] have to water it and pet it and and
[1:17:27] spray it every 2 seconds to keep the
[1:17:29] bugs off but when you are an original
[1:17:32] seed when you are an original plant you
[1:17:35] don't need to be hybrid you don't need
[1:17:37] to be petted and pugged oh Hal you've
[1:17:40] got something in you that keeps you in
[1:17:42] the storm and when the winds blow
[1:17:45] contrary you are mechanized you are
[1:17:47] designed for your roots to go deeper
[1:17:51] deeper in the love of God you get deeper
[1:17:53] into prayer you get deeper into
[1:17:56] consecration because you know that's
[1:17:58] where your strength comes from
[1:18:01] oh I need somebody tonight to be able to
[1:18:04] connect with their God on a deeper level
[1:18:07] and to understand that the fruits on top
[1:18:10] are own a reflection of the roots
[1:18:12] [Music]
[1:18:13] below the only reason you're standing is
[1:18:16] because of what he put you through made
[1:18:19] your roots go deeper now you pray more
[1:18:22] deeper now you seek God more deeper
[1:18:25] and all of a sudden out of that bears
[1:18:27] fruits of patience fruits of Love fruits
[1:18:30] of tenderness fruits of humility fruits
[1:18:33] of reverence fruits of Godly fear
[1:18:36] because of what he's putting you through
[1:18:37] in the
[1:18:40] roots no wonder God could have
[1:18:42] confidence hallelujah hallelujah say I
[1:18:44] will
[1:18:46] restore all the years that the
[1:18:48] cankerworm and the caterpillar and the
[1:18:50] Locust had eaten away from you you see
[1:18:54] they ate at the top they had a feast all
[1:18:57] on the top above the ground but the
[1:18:59] secret is the word is in the bride the
[1:19:02] secret is what's really going on below
[1:19:04] the half oh the other half has not yet
[1:19:07] been told how deep your roots go and
[1:19:10] that's why God can prophesy over your
[1:19:13] life because he knows how deep those
[1:19:15] roots go oh H you can say I will restore
[1:19:19] to you all the years that the devil had
[1:19:22] taken from you that the devil had taken
[1:19:24] from from your family that the devil had
[1:19:26] taken from your life and your prayer and
[1:19:28] your consecration I will restore it
[1:19:32] won't be by your might it won't be by
[1:19:34] your strength but the power of God unto
[1:19:37] salvation is going to rip you out of the
[1:19:40] world and into Glory it takes the power
[1:19:43] of God to do it and God's power is here
[1:19:45] tonight to give you the power oh

[1:22:47] spiritual house it's not something we
[1:22:49] could build with our hands it's not
[1:22:51] something we're doing with our own minds
[1:22:53] or with our own free will it's not
[1:22:56] turning over a new Leaf in that sense

[1:23:01] down your own will when you put yourself
[1:23:04] on God's altar oh Hal isn't that right
[1:23:06] and offer yourself and say Lord live in

[1:23:19] pleasure just like Moses denied the
[1:23:21] pleasures of Egypt to be identified with
[1:23:24] modders so do we deny the pleasures of

[1:33:05] you tonight amen oh my I really enjoyed
[1:33:09] preaching to you and as we get ready to
[1:33:11] close Prophet said we're like
[1:33:14] Abraham uh he said Abraham received the
[1:33:17] word and anything was contrary to the
[1:33:19] word he called it as if it wasn't and
[1:33:21] any trueborn child of God receive God's
[1:33:24] word he said and I don't care what
[1:33:26] anybody says what system speaks against
[1:33:30] that word that word is true
[1:33:33] anyhow and he said God is obligated to
[1:33:37] meet you on the basis of his promises
[1:33:40] outside of them promises he can meet you
[1:33:43] because you cut yourself off from him
[1:33:46] and he said that's the reason our world
[1:33:49] is falling apart in closing that we
[1:33:52] might say this he says anything that's
[1:33:54] contrary to it it's a though it wasn't
[1:33:57] such a madade system he said we never
[1:34:00] look to that no sir being then baptized
[1:34:04] into this Kingdom oh how by the baptism
[1:34:08] of the Holy Ghost you are baptized into
[1:34:11] this Kingdom isn't that right he said we
[1:34:13] are now sitting in Heavenly places in
[1:34:17] Christ Jesus Oh My with our anointed
[1:34:21] king with us feasting on his kingdom
[1:34:25] promised word anointed and Vindicated
[1:34:28] right Among Us
[1:34:30] amen he says there it is his kingdom
[1:34:35] promise made right before us nothing can
[1:34:38] turn you from it no sir amen and amen do
[1:34:43] you believe it tonight praise God
[1:34:45] hallelujah
[1:34:46] hallelujah so we know Jesus was our
[1:34:48] example yes and then when he poured out
[1:34:51] his Spirit upon him in the upper room he
[1:34:53] made made them Witnesses unto him he
[1:34:56] made them written Epistles he made them
[1:34:59] examples Place sons and daughters in the
[1:35:01] kingdom of God Apostles prophets
[1:35:03] teachers Etc God placed a group
[1:35:06] Hallelujah into that early church there
[1:35:07] thank by the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:35:10] is that right that's the example he set
[1:35:12] to the early church and he said and now
[1:35:15] today what uh God wants to do the same
[1:35:17] thing today tonight to make us examples
[1:35:20] also amen God wants to make examples out
[1:35:22] of us you believe that
[1:35:24] amen that's just my notes here but
[1:35:25] here's a prophet here says in Revelation
[1:35:26] Jesus Christ let me show you another
[1:35:28] reason why Satan hates This Book of
[1:35:30] Revelation he knows that Jesus Christ is
[1:35:32] the same yesterday and today and forever
[1:35:36] Hallelujah he changes not his example
[1:35:39] amen he knows that a whole lot more than
[1:35:42] 90% of the theologians the devil he
[1:35:44] knows that since God is immutable in his
[1:35:48] nature he's just immutable in his ways
[1:35:51] he's constantly God isn't that right
[1:35:55] thus Satan knows assuredly that the
[1:35:57] original church at Pentecost with the
[1:36:00] power of God St Mark 16 in action is the
[1:36:04] true church that Jesus claims as his own
[1:36:08] and all else is false it has to be oh so
[1:36:12] we want nothing less tonight than St
[1:36:15] Mark 16 in action go for Healing The
[1:36:18] Sick raising the dead casting out Devils
[1:36:21] that's the example he sets and we are
[1:36:24] raised up to receive the same holy ghost
[1:36:26] that Peter received the same holy ghost
[1:36:29] that Mary received the same holy ghost
[1:36:31] that James and John you are going to
[1:36:33] receive it and you are going to do the
[1:36:35] same works that they did when they were
[1:36:38] here healing a sick raising the dead
[1:36:41] casting out Devils freely as you have
[1:36:43] received freely do you give you could
[1:36:46] forgive you could repent you could fly
[1:36:49] away to heaven like they
[1:36:51] did because you're a living example of
[1:36:55] what they did with the same spirit in
[1:36:58] them same works that they did amen he
[1:37:01] said how can we turn that word to a
[1:37:03] system what does it do it denies the
[1:37:04] word you have to reject the truth before
[1:37:07] you can have an error that's exactly
[1:37:08] right you play something Me Softly you
[1:37:10] believe that congregation says amen all
[1:37:13] right he said well that's the hour we're
[1:37:15] living in the world is falling apart
[1:37:17] there hangs in the hangers bombs there
[1:37:20] hangs the things just to do it exactly
[1:37:23] weapons of of mass destruction right
