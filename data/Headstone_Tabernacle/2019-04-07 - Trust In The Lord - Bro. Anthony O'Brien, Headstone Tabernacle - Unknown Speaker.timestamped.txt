[1:09:43] 3
[1:09:55] Reverb chapter 3 and when I read from

[1:10:08] Lord with all thine heart and lean not
[1:10:12] unto thine own understanding in all thy
[1:10:16] ways acknowledge him and he shall direct
[1:10:19] thy paths as tell over to Ephesians one
[1:10:24] also and we want to read from verse 11
[1:10:28] their visions 1 and verse 11 says in
[1:10:41] whom also we have obtained an
[1:10:43] inheritance being predestinated
[1:10:44] according to the purpose of him who
[1:10:47] worketh all things after the counsel of
[1:10:50] his own will that we should be to the
[1:10:53] praise of his glory who first trusted in
[1:10:56] Christ in whom ye also trusted after
[1:11:00] that ye heard the word of truth the
[1:11:04] gospel of your salvation in whom also
[1:11:07] after that he believed he was sealed
[1:11:10] with that holy spirit of promise which
[1:11:13] is the earnest of our inheritance until
[1:11:16] the redemption of the purchased
[1:11:18] possession unto the praise of his glory
[1:11:21] and God a blessing to the ring of his
[1:11:23] word

[1:12:56] in leading in Jesus name Amen and amen
[1:12:59] praise God he may have his seats him in
[1:13:07] preschool are you happy to be the house
[1:13:11] of the Lord this morning certainly a
[1:13:13] privilege to be gathered in his name to
[1:13:16] feel his spirit all around us
[1:13:18] amen amen I said you want to ppreciate
[1:13:20] but Isaac of in last week and a message
[1:13:22] a man worries me I am undone amen and it
[1:13:29] just brings us to a reality of condition
[1:13:33] and all flesh is as filthy rags in the
[1:13:36] sight of God and now we need more of him
[1:13:39] this morning we're not afraid to
[1:13:41] acknowledge or littleness this morning
[1:13:43] how low we are how much we need him
[1:13:47] among how much he needs us this morning
[1:13:50] to surrender ourselves completely to his
[1:13:53] word and to his will and to his purpose
[1:13:56] because there's something he's trying to
[1:13:59] achieve and because he has a plan and
[1:14:01] because he has a program on an order
[1:14:04] he can't have rebels in his kingdom he
[1:14:08] can't have people who are free thinkers
[1:14:10] he's got to have people who could use
[1:14:14] people he could talk to a witness that
[1:14:17] he could lay his hand upon and say here
[1:14:19] is my spirit flowing freely he's got to
[1:14:23] have some brother some sister who's got
[1:14:26] compassion enough and like the Prophet
[1:14:29] said compassion is not feeling sorry for
[1:14:31] somebody but compassion is to be the
[1:14:34] ability to do the will of God somebody
[1:14:38] that he could use this morning to do his
[1:14:41] will and to do his purpose
[1:14:43] somebody who has a heart this morning so
[1:14:46] this spirit of God this morning is
[1:14:47] moving throughout the earth and he's
[1:14:49] looking for hearts this morning he's
[1:14:52] looking for lives this morning that
[1:14:54] wants to be changed that want to be
[1:14:56] transformed that are not comfortable at
[1:14:59] where they are that are not satisfied
[1:15:02] with just a sprinkle that are not
[1:15:04] satisfied with just a little dash of
[1:15:06] blessings but they want a shower of
[1:15:08] blessings this morning because there's a
[1:15:10] shower of blessings shower blessing we
[1:15:14] need that's promised in this scripture
[1:15:16] and it's promised for you this morning
[1:15:18] it's done to you and to your children
[1:15:20] it's unto you until your family and as
[1:15:23] many as a lord or God shall call oh
[1:15:26] there's a reason to shout this morning
[1:15:29] there's a reason to worship this morning
[1:15:31] there's a reason to praise God this
[1:15:33] morning Oh hallelujah amen any man glory
[1:15:40] be to God hallelujah Eman so have a
[1:15:44] title this morning amen my title is
[1:15:48] trust in the Lord trust in the Lord and
[1:15:57] I'm gonna take my time because I you
[1:15:59] know I feel like this kind of needs to
[1:16:02] be not rushed again so maybe just
[1:16:05] meditated on but that would trust is
[1:16:11] just about five letters but it's a big
[1:16:15] word
[1:16:16] it's very big you know and we live in a
[1:16:22] world where it's hard to trust people
[1:16:26] sometimes you don't know who to trust I
[1:16:29] worked in a company one time and one
[1:16:32] time the manager somebody calling the
[1:16:34] phone and I was like yeah sure and
[1:16:35] whatever so and then I hung up and then
[1:16:38] they asked the question who is that so
[1:16:42] they want a certain product or service
[1:16:44] or something and when I call they get
[1:16:46] that number I felt like I was being one
[1:16:49] interrogated a mess for taking the phone
[1:16:52] call you know legitimately wanted
[1:16:55] something from the business but you know
[1:16:58] they just wanted to know where this call
[1:17:00] came from you know they wanted to kind
[1:17:01] of monitor and track you know the
[1:17:03] activity I guess whatever its to
[1:17:04] marketing or to with a mouth but it just
[1:17:08] felt I sold it you know I felt
[1:17:09] interrogated at the time because you
[1:17:11] know I'm you know just I didn't mean to
[1:17:13] take the call let's take the call you
[1:17:14] know but he asking where this person
[1:17:17] come from you know who do they hear
[1:17:19] about us you know that kind of thing and
[1:17:21] you know they had their ways and so on
[1:17:23] and you know and they want to just make
[1:17:26] sure that things was all right and
[1:17:27] people wasn't commenting and random off
[1:17:30] the street you know because they had
[1:17:32] assets to protect they had a you know
[1:17:34] investments they had their thing going
[1:17:36] on and they didn't want to feel like
[1:17:38] their security was being breached by
[1:17:40] intruders isn't there a praise God we
[1:17:43] live in such a world like that where we
[1:17:45] where we where we it's hard to trust
[1:17:48] because man is in his fallen condition
[1:17:50] and a heart of man we know is corrupt
[1:17:54] it's desperately wicked it's doomed to
[1:17:57] failure it's doomed to fall but for
[1:18:01] Jesus this morning
[1:18:03] we'd be doomed to fall we'd be doomed to
[1:18:06] failure nothing that we do in our laptop
[1:18:10] could ever attain what God has in store
[1:18:14] for us but it's because he died he made
[1:18:18] a way for us
[1:18:20] to come back to the perfection that we
[1:18:23] once knew but had he not done that there
[1:18:28] is nothing that you could do in your
[1:18:30] natural ability to ever attain Christ
[1:18:34] but because he loved us he reached out
[1:18:38] to us because he loved us his love
[1:18:43] projected itself and that love took on a
[1:18:46] form that love to go to face and that
[1:18:50] face was Jesus that love had a voice and
[1:18:54] that point said Peter come and you come
[1:18:58] Phillip come pitch you to come come unto
[1:19:03] me all that I heavily laden and I'll
[1:19:06] give you rush oh do you want rest this
[1:19:11] morning do you want help this morning do
[1:19:15] you need shelter this morning it's in
[1:19:17] Jesus it's in the Savior don't worry
[1:19:24] about anybody tries to point you to a
[1:19:26] certain group or to a certain belief or
[1:19:29] to a certain thing hope is in Christ
[1:19:32] belief in God in his word that's the
[1:19:36] only way out outside of that is just
[1:19:38] man-made systems man-made ideas because
[1:19:42] it's not written in his word anywhere
[1:19:44] that is flesh that flesh will glory in
[1:19:46] his presence no no no anytime someone's
[1:19:49] pointing you back to the flesh it can't
[1:19:51] be that it has to be the word it has to
[1:19:55] be what he says and that's what we are
[1:19:58] trusting in this morning not in our own
[1:20:00] understanding not in our own
[1:20:03] interpretation not in our own idea not
[1:20:07] in our own opinion but we want to trust
[1:20:09] entirely in the Lord this morning
[1:20:12] because outside of him there's no way
[1:20:15] out outside of him there's no rapture
[1:20:18] for the church but because he died he
[1:20:21] made a way and he rose on the third day
[1:20:24] as the firstfruits of them that slept to
[1:20:28] prove that there is a way out that
[1:20:31] there's coal appear as
[1:20:32] action that is gonna be a rapture the
[1:20:35] evidence Oh hallelujah hallelujah glory
[1:20:40] to God and what we see or to make a
[1:20:44] church not a make a revival what we see
[1:20:47] or to put every soul into action what we
[1:20:50] see or the get us desperate what we see
[1:20:52] all together sprayed up what we see or
[1:20:55] to get us on fire what we see oughta
[1:20:57] make us worship or to make a shouts or
[1:21:00] to make us praise God for what he has
[1:21:03] done for us Oh hallelujah we have never
[1:21:06] made it if it wasn't for him Oh
[1:21:10] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:21:12] do you believe in this morning man is
[1:21:16] finite man is measured number than these
[1:21:22] is nothing hallelujah but God is eternal
[1:21:25] and it's word is eternal
[1:21:27] so therefore if God is eternal and it's
[1:21:30] word is eternal we are only about
[1:21:32] adoption time then how are we to trust
[1:21:36] in this God of the universe how are we
[1:21:39] to trust in this core of the heavens how
[1:21:42] are we to trust in his ways
[1:21:44] trust in his word it might sound simple
[1:21:47] this morning but it's a big way God
[1:21:55] wants the church you love him prophet
[1:21:57] said soon not if he to love him you
[1:21:59] gotta trust him you gotta trust that
[1:22:02] things will be okay even when it doesn't
[1:22:05] look like it's going to be okay you're
[1:22:07] still trusting in something a higher
[1:22:10] wind a higher power a higher purpose a
[1:22:15] higher program hallelujah it's so good
[1:22:19] to trust in Jesus when all the world
[1:22:22] fails when all our minds fail and all
[1:22:25] our achievements feel when all that
[1:22:28] we've tried to do fails God cannot fail
[1:22:32] when our family fails what our friends
[1:22:36] fail God cannot fail
[1:22:39] he is his word or what he promised he'd
[1:22:42] be with you no I'll be with you always
[1:22:45] even to the end of the earth no other
[1:22:49] friend like Jesus no other lover like
[1:22:52] Jesus he's a lover of your soul this
[1:22:54] morning he woke you up this morning it
[1:22:58] wasn't your alarm clock but Isaac alarm
[1:23:00] clocks never woke nobody up but you had
[1:23:03] a soul inside of there that caught
[1:23:05] predestinated before the foundation of
[1:23:08] the world God has a purpose for you this
[1:23:11] morning trust in the Lord
[1:23:13] believing alone hope in God I had an
[1:23:28] interesting experience yesterday I went
[1:23:32] to the mechanic and uhm it's funny I am
[1:23:38] I went there with a problem and then
[1:23:40] when I left I realized that the problem
[1:23:42] wasn't fixed you know and I knew that
[1:23:46] because I was I'm accustomed driving my
[1:23:49] car so I I think I kind of know how it
[1:23:51] feels so I left the shop and I said well
[1:23:55] thank you no I paid the money and
[1:23:56] everything and I left and after I was
[1:23:58] driving I was like this doesn't feel
[1:23:59] right so I I said I got to go back
[1:24:04] because I didn't get what I wanted
[1:24:06] I'm not satisfied with you know my
[1:24:09] service so I went back and I said you
[1:24:11] know I'm still getting the same problem
[1:24:14] you know and sometimes I feel like
[1:24:17] that's how we feel in life sometimes we
[1:24:18] come for an answer for something and
[1:24:20] maybe we get a little encouragement
[1:24:22] along the way but maybe it's not enough
[1:24:25] maybe that certain thing isn't fixed yet
[1:24:27] you know it's wrong but you're trying to
[1:24:31] pretend like it's okay the light is
[1:24:34] blinking you're ignoring it but you need
[1:24:39] to go to the mechanic
[1:24:41] you need to get a checked out don't be
[1:24:45] satisfied with a halfway performance in
[1:24:48] your Christianity when you tumble the
[1:24:51] engine you wanna feel it raw you wanna
[1:24:55] know that you caught the extra to make
[1:24:58] it to glory I wanna know that I've done
[1:25:01] all I can to make it to glory I wanna
[1:25:04] know I've got what it takes
[1:25:06] I've made the requirements I've got the
[1:25:09] Holy Ghost whatever it is that God is
[1:25:11] asking of us we've got to have it
[1:25:14] friends it's something else and you know
[1:25:20] when it's wrong you know and it feels
[1:25:23] kind of funny in the first gear mash
[1:25:26] down is just not right you're asking up
[1:25:28] the engine and it's just not doing what
[1:25:30] it's supposed to do you're trying to
[1:25:32] pray in it feel like you hitting a wall
[1:25:35] somewhere raise up your hand to worship
[1:25:38] but feel a little condemned you need a
[1:25:41] mechanic this morning oh need somebody
[1:25:49] to check you out check out your insides
[1:25:52] see how you're moving see how you're
[1:25:55] flowing test it a little bit try it a
[1:25:58] little bit shake it a little bit do
[1:26:01] something crazy oh yeah now let's see
[1:26:09] somebody buys a car they buy a car
[1:26:10] hypothetically all right $100,000 150 or
[1:26:13] something you know maybe the back
[1:26:15] showroom and they love that kind of the
[1:26:18] car drive around in it that's a little
[1:26:19] space you know it's a little gospel
[1:26:21] music you're in your zone a man so if
[1:26:24] you like your value you value this thing
[1:26:25] because you can't really get around much
[1:26:27] and it's kind of expensive to travel
[1:26:29] these days so it makes sense but now you
[1:26:34] have to now trust this vehicle that you
[1:26:36] paid your money with to a mechanic and
[1:26:40] you have to trust that this guy knows
[1:26:42] what he's doing
[1:26:43] this how much have a hundred thousand
[1:26:46] vehicle or whatever you have to know put
[1:26:48] it in his hands and say I don't know
[1:26:49] what to do and that's a big level of
[1:26:52] trust
[1:26:53] because in an investment you made for
[1:26:56] you and your family or whatever you're
[1:26:58] benefiting from and you're hoping you're
[1:27:00] praying that this guy knows what he's
[1:27:01] doing
[1:27:02] it's nothing so that's kind of how I
[1:27:06] felt he meant and I and I sat over the
[1:27:09] bonnet looking at him doing his thing
[1:27:11] and he and he started yanking stuff out
[1:27:16] yeah it's tough my heart is in my hand
[1:27:21] I'm just pulling our tubes he's
[1:27:23] unhooking this moving that moving that
[1:27:25] moving that he was saying there's
[1:27:27] something down there we need to get to
[1:27:29] he moved the battery out he pulled the
[1:27:31] poles out rip this out
[1:27:33] pulled a blow out he said in this house
[1:27:34] ago that has to go leave a nice idea
[1:27:37] half my engine is laying on the ground
[1:27:39] until he got to the source then he took
[1:27:43] a big drill and he kept going and he
[1:27:46] didn't stop until he pulled out a tiny
[1:27:49] little that was just busto a good way
[1:27:52] this is warning to him you need a new
[1:27:55] one and he replaced it and guess what
[1:27:58] when he was put in the back he knew
[1:28:00] where every piece was he knew where
[1:28:04] every piece was he wasn't worried he
[1:28:07] wasn't afraid he knew what he was doing
[1:28:10] he had the experience the knowledge to
[1:28:12] know where to put what and today I'm
[1:28:14] saying that Jesus has he experienced
[1:28:16] this morning to know where to put what
[1:28:19] sometimes he's yanking stuff out in
[1:28:22] their life don't worry just trust him
[1:28:25] he knows what he's doing this morning
[1:28:28] he's trying to get to the source of your
[1:28:31] problem this morning
[1:28:33] sometimes it's deeper than you think
[1:28:35] sometimes it's deeper than you feel but
[1:28:38] it's a problem but he knows this morning
[1:28:41] how to get it out this small sometimes
[1:28:49] you take a trial sometimes they take a
[1:28:51] test some then take a rebuke sometimes
[1:28:54] they take a correction sometimes he
[1:28:56] passes to the fire some to the flood but
[1:29:00] all through the blood all his sons and
[1:29:03] daughters
[1:29:04] in order to pass through they've got to
[1:29:06] be tested they've got to be proven to be
[1:29:10] the right kind of a son to be the right
[1:29:12] kind of a doctor that he could say here
[1:29:15] is my spirit flowing freely trust it's a
[1:29:39] really big word God wants the church to
[1:29:42] trust him
[1:29:43] trust that he'll take over we always
[1:29:46] talk about that story with butter
[1:29:48] Branham when he was a guy it's not right
[1:29:50] and he was a training tracker he knew
[1:29:54] his way around the woods he knew his way
[1:29:56] around the forest he knew where to go
[1:29:59] how to feel the tree and no way it was
[1:30:02] and different things is not right
[1:30:04] but it got to a point where he realized
[1:30:07] that he couldn't lead himself no more
[1:30:10] because he went around and he'd come
[1:30:13] back to a point that he recognized it
[1:30:15] was the same point he was making a
[1:30:18] circle but he still kept telling himself
[1:30:20] it's okay I'll make it out and he kept
[1:30:24] going on again and he came back to the
[1:30:26] same point he said the Indians call it
[1:30:28] the death walk and some people make the
[1:30:31] death walk in their lives making circles
[1:30:35] going around and around thinking that
[1:30:38] they're okay like what Isaac said last
[1:30:41] week but you're not okay you need help
[1:30:44] you need deliverance you need salvation
[1:30:48] you need a repentance you need that guy
[1:30:50] this morning you need somebody to take
[1:30:53] you by the hand and show you where to go
[1:30:57] because we don't know the way we have
[1:31:00] not been this way before but we are
[1:31:03] leaning on the everlasting arms this
[1:31:05] morning
[1:31:07] to show us how to get out of here this
[1:31:10] world is so full of evil that it's
[1:31:13] impossible jesus said unless that these
[1:31:16] are shortened no flesh would be saved
[1:31:19] but for the elects sake he will shorten
[1:31:24] those things and for your sake this
[1:31:27] morning because of who you are God said
[1:31:31] shall I hide from Abraham what I'm about
[1:31:35] to do because you are who you are God
[1:31:39] has to show you certain things so that
[1:31:42] the pride is not caught unawares but I
[1:31:45] should be ready when the bridegroom
[1:31:47] comes Oh will your lamps be trimmed and
[1:31:51] burning Brides oh when he comes
[1:31:54] brother you got to be ready you got to
[1:31:57] be prayed up you got to be on fire you

[1:32:05] be making preparation for the angel to
[1:32:08] come in your home in your community in
[1:32:11] your life in your family this morning
[1:32:17] [Applause]
[1:32:22] [Music]
[1:32:24] got to be ready there has to be a way
[1:32:27] prepared for him to come look at Jesus
[1:32:32] he couldn't just roll in God ordained
[1:32:34] John a witness to cool before and to
[1:32:39] make a path straight that the Messiah
[1:32:42] could come through he said I am NOT the
[1:32:45] one I am baptizing only with water but
[1:32:49] it's coming one who shall surely visit
[1:32:51] you with fire he's gonna baptize you
[1:32:54] with the Holy Ghost he's gonna change
[1:32:57] you my ministry is only to prepare you
[1:33:01] for his coming my ministry is only to
[1:33:05] prepare you for what's about to take
[1:33:07] place
[1:33:08] the voice of one crying in the
[1:33:10] wilderness prepare ye the way of the
[1:33:12] Lord
[1:33:13] hallo Leute make every Valley low
[1:33:15] oh this later root of the tree I can
[1:33:20] imagine Chan out there preaching isn't
[1:33:22] that right
[1:33:23] but over McDermott has it many times
[1:33:25] John so Whitney with the Hezekiah
[1:33:29] obadiah's around there was just this man
[1:33:31] called John Ethan while locusts and
[1:33:34] honey in the backside of the desert but
[1:33:37] God calling for purpose God calling for
[1:33:39] witness
[1:33:40] God calling for a specific thing to do
[1:33:42] honey I might have looked funny to the
[1:33:44] world hello but John hallelujah was
[1:33:47] trusting in the Lord he wasn't trusting
[1:33:50] in what the Pharisees were saying
[1:33:51] nothing what the Sassy's were saying
[1:33:53] nothing what the sexes were saying the
[1:33:54] scribes or whoever prays didn't matter
[1:33:57] what kind of church they were having

[1:37:23] from God all we trust in too much
[1:37:26] frivolous things sometimes we need to
[1:37:29] turn our attention upon Jesus and trust
[1:37:32] in the Lord that he who made a good work

[1:39:16] else so what other people say but you're
[1:39:19] trusting in the Lord it's enough for you
[1:39:25] to keep you when things don't go right
[1:39:29] there's somewhere you could turn to oh
[1:39:33] hallelujah
[1:39:34] Oh hallelujah hallelujah
[1:39:39] David said there's a river streams
[1:39:42] whereof shall make a city of God though
[1:39:46] a thousand fall in my right hand of ten
[1:39:48] thousand on my left shall not come nigh
[1:39:51] thee only with that I shall shall behold
[1:39:54] and see the reward of the wicked because
[1:39:57] thou has made the law which is that
[1:39:59] habitation to help he is a present help
[1:40:02] in time of trouble oh-oh we need him we
[1:40:13] need him we need him every hour we need
[1:40:18] him every moment
[1:40:19] oh honey of every day hallelujah
[1:40:26] you know the shepherds the Shepherd's
[1:40:28] they they keep the flocks the Bible
[1:40:31] relate speaks about Shepherd's a lot and
[1:40:33] especially the Old Testament and
[1:40:35] different things and Jesus made
[1:40:36] reference to shepherds you know we think
[1:40:39] about sometimes Oh shoppers they take
[1:40:42] the Sheep far out grazing sometimes and
[1:40:45] you know they are there grazing and
[1:40:47] bleating and so on sometimes a shepherd
[1:40:49] would look up into the horizon and
[1:40:51] there's an oncoming storm
[1:40:53] sometimes it's it's too far to get back
[1:40:56] to the to the pen so sometimes a
[1:40:58] shepherd to take the flock and it would
[1:41:01] carry them up into the high a high part
[1:41:06] under a rock and a cleft of a rock
[1:41:10] sometimes that's the only escape that
[1:41:13] there is from the oncoming storm and
[1:41:16] under day might Kindle a fire they might
[1:41:19] run rally the sheep around the fire and
[1:41:22] keep warm just until the storm blows
[1:41:24] over and how precious it is to have a
[1:41:27] place a safe haven that a shepherd could
[1:41:31] go with his sheep hallelujah and fine
[1:41:34] rest and find refuge from the oncoming
[1:41:38] storm
[1:41:39] no wonder David's had lead me to the
[1:41:42] rock that is higher than I when my heart
[1:41:46] is overwhelmed when the storms are
[1:41:48] raging when the lightnings flash when
[1:41:52] the thunders roar
[1:41:53] Jesus lead me to the rock take me in the
[1:41:57] cleft of the rock in there hide me in
[1:41:59] your presence hide me in your bosom
[1:42:02] sometimes it's the only safe place you
[1:42:04] could go
[1:42:05] Oh hallelujah when King Uzziah died I
[1:42:08] say oh as expose he couldn't go to the
[1:42:12] psychiatrist he couldn't go to the
[1:42:14] therapist he couldn't go to his friends
[1:42:16] he couldn't go to his family they didn't
[1:42:19] have no answer he couldn't help him but
[1:42:23] I see a new one place that he could go
[1:42:25] where he could finally answer for what
[1:42:29] he was looking for and I say I ran into
[1:42:32] the temple and they got caught up in a
[1:42:42] vision see the power of God moving back
[1:42:47] and forth the post booth
[1:42:52] what a vision some people come to church
[1:42:56] first show so we become the church just
[1:42:59] to make up space but that wasn't Isaiah
[1:43:02] that's not you this morning we come the
[1:43:05] catch of vision our vision is greater
[1:43:08] than us a vision to inspire to wake us
[1:43:13] up out of our folly and say woe is me I
[1:43:17] am undone I need your help Lord I need
[1:43:22] your strength Lord I need your guidance
[1:43:24] law I can't make it without you
[1:43:26] I didn't make it this far without you
[1:43:29] and I can't go on without you oh not the
[1:43:33] way you feel this morning hallelujah
[1:43:36] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah we hid
[1:43:40] the surrender
[1:43:41] we hid a let go and let go amen now
[1:43:48] there's two kinds of trust that I want
[1:43:50] to speak on that's the trust we haven't
[1:43:54] gone it's not right and there's also the
[1:43:58] trust that God places in us I want to
[1:44:02] speak on out as well because in the
[1:44:04] beginning God had a man he could trust
[1:44:07] my name Adam isn't alright says I give
[1:44:11] you dominion over the fowl of the air
[1:44:13] the fish of the sea I give you power
[1:44:15] over every creeping thing God trusted in
[1:44:19] this man so much that when he was
[1:44:23] finished he turned about his tiny
[1:44:25] balcony
[1:44:26] arrest a man is that right he was able
[1:44:28] to turn his back and leave man to run
[1:44:31] and rule things he was able to come down
[1:44:34] in the cool of the evening just to get a
[1:44:36] report on how things were doing and how
[1:44:39] he did this and how he moved that and
[1:44:41] how he changed this color hand I named
[1:44:44] this animal here there was a man that
[1:44:47] God could trust trust him with his woman
[1:44:50] trust him with power trust him with
[1:44:53] authority how could he trust this man
[1:44:56] because he had the same nature he had
[1:44:59] the same likeness like this man and he
[1:45:02] was a perfect reflection
[1:45:03] of God on the earth when God looked down
[1:45:06] you see himself and God had no problem
[1:45:10] to trust this man with power and with
[1:45:13] glory
[1:45:16] people said who is man did you have
[1:45:19] crowned him with glory and power what is
[1:45:21] man that thou art mindful of him
[1:45:23] there's something about you this morning
[1:45:25] that's very very special and a devil's
[1:45:28] job is to try to make you not see that
[1:45:31] so we're trusting in our eyes what we
[1:45:34] could see trusting in our ears what we
[1:45:37] get here but we're not trusting on God
[1:45:39] we're not leading away from our own
[1:45:41] understanding it's now looking at the
[1:45:46] opinions of others rather than what God
[1:45:48] has to say about it but God's Word is
[1:45:52] above that above all pinions above what
[1:45:56] people think above ideas above above any
[1:46:00] potentate any sovereign throne above all
[1:46:05] of that it's a word of God no matter
[1:46:08] what law man makes
[1:46:10] God's Word is above it this morning so
[1:46:13] therefore the law of sin and death that
[1:46:16] dwells within your members it's trying
[1:46:18] to keep you down this morning it's
[1:46:20] trying to keep you from praising it's
[1:46:22] trying to keep you from worshiping then
[1:46:24] this morning there's a higher law the
[1:46:26] law of the Spirit which is life in
[1:46:29] Christ Jesus that is here to set you
[1:46:32] free this morning from the law of sin
[1:46:35] and death there's a higher law this one
[1:46:44] hallelujah hallelujah priest goodie man
[1:46:50] huh so God had a man Iike trust isn't
[1:46:55] that right and that man forfeited
[1:47:00] doctrines it's now right
[1:47:03] you gave up the word and he received an
[1:47:06] interpretation of how to multiply and
[1:47:09] replenish it's not right what the devil
[1:47:12] thought it was he shall not surely die
[1:47:15] and him a man and down went the whole
[1:47:20] nature because so much was entrusted in
[1:47:24] this man's hand and when he fell it all
[1:47:27] fell upon a lion would lay with the lamb
[1:47:30] but when that took place it was a
[1:47:33] different scene it was chaos it was wall
[1:47:38] it was famine there was strife there was
[1:47:42] sickness there was politics there was
[1:47:45] confusion Burana brought out hearty
[1:47:49] atmospheres filled with sin filled with
[1:47:54] with with pollutant in the atmosphere in
[1:47:57] the spirit world isn't all right but
[1:48:00] when that holy time come when go to
[1:48:03] cleanse the earth with fire all that
[1:48:06] gonna get cleanse away all that's gonna
[1:48:09] get cleared away John said I beheld and
[1:48:12] saw a city coming down from God out of
[1:48:14] heaven adorned as a pride for a husband
[1:48:18] Oh hallelujah a beautiful city a city
[1:48:21] with streets of gold a city with Jesus
[1:48:25] in it where the lamb is the light Oh
[1:48:27] hallelujah hallelujah that's a promise

[1:48:33] think about that promise it makes me
[1:48:35] wanna shout hallelujah thank you Jesus

[1:48:48] get excited about there's a promise
[1:48:50] beyond

[1:48:53] new earth a new system a new order Ohana

[1:49:25] eyes every frustration every depression

[1:50:17] yes sir could you imagine could you
[1:50:20] imagine every prophet walk the earth
[1:50:23] seeking a city whose making below is God
[1:50:26] they were dressed in priests gone all
[1:50:30] tattered rags sometimes I need a stick
[1:50:32] in their hand sometimes they were just
[1:50:34] traveling through but they were not from
[1:50:36] here
[1:50:37] they were not seeking anything glory
[1:50:39] they were not seeking any riches of this
[1:50:41] world their riches was in heaven holiday
[1:50:44] came with the wood over the Lord they
[1:50:46] came with the word of Almighty God
[1:50:48] that's what they trusted in that's what
[1:50:51] they rested upon the holy prophets and
[1:50:54] apostles stood for the truth Oh
[1:50:57] hallelujah praise God a meddler
[1:51:00] or here we are 2019 the pride of Jesus
[1:51:04] Christ Oh hallelujah standing upon that
[1:51:07] same word that the prophet said upon the
[1:51:10] apostles sit upon they longed to be here
[1:51:13] in this age but we are here this morning
[1:51:15] and we are trusting in this we are
[1:51:20] trusting what put a pranam said the
[1:51:23] prophet of this age Oh what he said
[1:51:26] shall come to pass a man is now right he
[1:51:30] said I'm only building
[1:51:32] I'm only laying a foundation for short
[1:51:35] quick message that's gonna shake the
[1:51:37] whole nation let's go to shake Europe
[1:51:40] shake Trinidad shake Africa oh it won't
[1:51:44] be long but it will be Oh hallelujah
[1:52:01] so we know today the devil is a liar
[1:52:04] that the devil's finish his time is over
[1:52:07] his time is about up the Bible says he
[1:52:10] has a short time to work but when his
[1:52:12] time is finished it's finished there's
[1:52:15] no more he could - so he's doing all he
[1:52:18] could do now because when that time
[1:52:20] comes it'll be a different thing when
[1:52:22] that which is perfect is come that
[1:52:25] richness isn't Pop's will be torn away
[1:52:27] which there will be a pride on the earth
[1:52:30] who will not be moved she will not be
[1:52:32] shaken she will not be destroyed she
[1:52:35] will be trusting in God she will do
[1:52:38] nothing unless the father sure Oh
[1:52:44] [Music]
[1:52:48] Halloween or give him praise or give him
[1:52:52] praise or give him praise Lord of her us
[1:53:12] to trust him sometimes you have to go
[1:53:15] through stuff sometimes gotta learn to
[1:53:22] trust him doesn't happen overnight
[1:53:29] acknowledge him in all your ways he
[1:53:33] shall direct thy paths so there's a
[1:53:37] there's a path that you have to take is
[1:53:42] now and God knows the way David even
[1:53:48] said thy word Oh Lord is a lamp unto my
[1:53:52] feet and a light unto my path so has
[1:53:57] that path again and the Word of God is
[1:54:01] acting as a lamp now just picture it all
[1:54:06] around the world is darkness everywhere
[1:54:08] is talk sometimes you can't see your
[1:54:12] hand in front your face so dark but the
[1:54:16] word is a lamp unto your feet if that
[1:54:24] don't make you shout I don't know what
[1:54:25] will and you know it's interesting
[1:54:35] because it's not a floodlight we'd like
[1:54:40] a floodlight that sounds really good but
[1:54:45] then where's the trust in there because
[1:54:47] you see everything so now there's no
[1:54:49] need to trust but if it's a lamp it
[1:54:52] shows you just
[1:54:54] just enough oh come on
[1:55:01] it just shows you what you need to know
[1:55:07] oh don't worry he knows the wing he'll
[1:55:14] take you to glory but trust him here
[1:55:17] first and then trust him a little more
[1:55:20] again and just keep moving forward
[1:55:23] don't turn around to the left hand no to
[1:55:26] the right hand just stay with the work
[1:55:30] and if you stay with that woman that God
[1:55:34] will show you a continuation of the
[1:55:42] church glory to God I feel inspired this
[1:55:47] morning if we stay with this word you're
[1:55:50] gonna see another vision
[1:55:51] you're gonna see another book of Acts
[1:55:53] the sick is going to be healed the blind
[1:55:55] will see the crippled walk there be more
[1:55:58] sons and daughters adopted like the
[1:56:01] Prophet was praise we stay with that
[1:56:06] word pray
[1:56:11] [Applause]
[1:56:13] I like until your path Oh hallelujah
[1:56:20] Jesus said straight to the gate now
[1:56:23] always doing few there be that find it
[1:56:27] it's not a highway it's not something
[1:56:31] you can find on ways Oh Google Maps no
[1:56:35] it's probably unmarked Road I think
[1:56:39] Google knows about this sometimes they
[1:56:41] ask Google who's Jesus and Google said
[1:56:44] I'm still learning well I don't need
[1:56:48] that Google who Jesus is I just have to
[1:56:50] flip through this book here praise God a
[1:56:52] man well He healed the sick he raised
[1:56:55] the dead
[1:56:55] he cast out devils he spoke to the storm
[1:56:58] praise God he made his tongue quiet
[1:57:00] praise God hallelujah
[1:57:03] he did this he did that I don't need
[1:57:05] Google to tell me when science fails
[1:57:08] Cortland never fail where technology
[1:57:11] fails
[1:57:12] God will never fail he will always be on
[1:57:14] time he's always there for you
[1:57:33] light onto your path lamp unto your feet
[1:57:37] I just love that word this morning he
[1:57:42] just shows you what you need to know you
[1:57:46] see because there's so much David said
[1:57:49] knowledge so high for me I cannot attain
[1:57:53] it description so much to know and
[1:58:00] people get caught up in that knowledge
[1:58:03] puffeth us up people get in the spirit
[1:58:07] of I know that like to keep going a
[1:58:11] mystery no need to find out that they
[1:58:14] have the mystery you got to come to them
[1:58:17] to figure out the mystery so don't miss
[1:58:20] Church now and trying to corner people
[1:58:24] you know like the Bible said II the
[1:58:30] things are secret they belong to God but
[1:58:34] the things which are revealed they
[1:58:36] belong to us they belong to you
[1:58:39] and if God sent a prophet and we believe
[1:58:43] he reveal every mystery then what other
[1:58:46] mystery are you gonna bring for me that
[1:58:48] the Prophet didn't already revealed
[1:58:50] there's no new message this is the same
[1:58:54] message that were preaching this morning
[1:58:56] there's no new revelation there's no new
[1:58:59] teacher it's the same God but what he's
[1:59:03] gonna do he's gonna take his word and
[1:59:05] make it more positive every single time
[1:59:09] and that's how he raises a standard so
[1:59:15] that when the enemy comes to try to
[1:59:18] shake you comes to try to move you comes
[1:59:21] to try to deter you your soul is
[1:59:23] anchored he the word in you it's been
[1:59:28] raised up inside of you he is making
[1:59:31] that more positive and you know you're
[1:59:33] gonna be living and you know you're
[1:59:35] gonna be here I know you're gonna make
[1:59:38] it you might see anything around you
[1:59:42] don't worry about what you see but the
[1:59:45] word that he gives you trust in that
[1:59:48] this morning trust in the holy spirit
[1:59:53] his ability will you first trusted in
[1:59:56] Christ then when we believe we are
[1:59:59] sealed with that Holy Spirit of promise
[2:00:07] [Music]
[2:00:09] so the Holy Ghost Holy Spirit that seal
[2:00:14] of God is coming to anoint the face
[2:00:17] inside of you to let you know that you
[2:00:20] are standing on the word it's going to
[2:00:24] anoint the word in your soul and make
[2:00:28] that live then it's no more than letter
[2:00:32] but the Spirit is now giving it life
[2:00:36] then you don't have to tell you the
[2:00:38] worship but the Spirit in you you lift
[2:00:41] your hands up the spirit in you you
[2:00:44] can't help it there's a fire in your
[2:00:48] heart that's burning and his name is
[2:00:51] Jesus and he bought you with a price and
[2:00:55] in you speaking back thou art the Son of
[2:00:58] God that's what I want that's what I
[2:01:03] come for this morning nothing short of a
[2:01:06] genuine experience of the Holy Ghost
[2:01:08] Halle hallelujah is knowledge where it
[2:01:11] speech and virtue and knowledge and
[2:01:13] temperance
[2:01:15] oh no Senora for us to trust him yes sir
[2:01:39] we have to go through some stuff
[2:01:43] sometimes not easy but that's the only
[2:01:47] way you could get us to trust him
[2:01:49] Abraham was told a promise your name is
[2:01:53] Abram I called you Abraham father of
[2:01:56] Nations you're gonna have a son what a
[2:01:59] pronouncement but Abraham didn't know
[2:02:02] that would it take a long time for that
[2:02:05] to take place
[2:02:06] God spoke that and went away for what 25
[2:02:10] years or so it's not right and Abraham
[2:02:12] had to believe what God said will come
[2:02:17] to pass and every day he woke up he
[2:02:20] looked the same you feel the same but
[2:02:23] the word was also still the same huh
[2:02:28] Sarah looked the same that's Sarah how
[2:02:31] you feeling this morning

[2:02:35] so nothing changed you said that's okay

[2:02:39] we're still gonna have a son Oh
[2:02:42] hallelujah come hell or high water that
[2:02:48] would remain the same they made their
[2:02:51] mistakes different things took place but
[2:02:54] God was still in control God was still
[2:02:57] gonna get the glory out of his story but
[2:03:01] Abraham had to trust that God would do
[2:03:04] it and he know that call would do it
[2:03:06] even when to talk to said Abraham me too
[2:03:09] old your wife is too old what are you
[2:03:12] doing Abraham said I heard from God
[2:03:15] nothing can move me he counted
[2:03:18] everything else as though it were not
[2:03:20] hallelujah praise God and I promise
[2:03:22] would remain true
[2:03:24] that promise would remain sure Halle
[2:03:27] Abraham had Isaac before yeah Liza

[2:03:33] was Isaac in the favor ahem he knew it

[2:04:41] of life Sarah's in a tent

[2:04:47] she laughed within herself

[2:05:01] very hard knowing that there's doubts in
[2:05:03] there but no matter how much zero
[2:05:06] doubted God still predestinated her to
[2:05:11] bring forth that promise son and I don't
[2:05:14] care how much you doubt this morning you

[2:05:22] pronounced a blessing over your life

[2:05:37] good to them that love call under them
[2:05:42] that I'll call according to his purpose
[2:05:46] glory to God so don't you doubt its
[2:05:56] trust and believe me man I want to read
[2:05:59] something here from the Prophet said a
[2:06:03] message called leadership and he said
[2:06:06] this remember this that each one of us
[2:06:08] young and old your first step that you
[2:06:12] ever made in your life he said someone
[2:06:15] had to lead you that's right and your
[2:06:19] last step you ever make someone will be
[2:06:22] leading you it's now right someone has
[2:06:26] to lead and he said God has liking us
[2:06:29] unto sheep and if anyone knows anything
[2:06:31] about or knows about raising sheep and
[2:06:33] the nature of sheep why you know that a
[2:06:38] sheep cannot find his way around that he
[2:06:41] has to be led even in the slaughter pens
[2:06:44] and we find that they bring that sheep
[2:06:47] in there and that he's led up into the
[2:06:48] slaughter by a goat and a goat leads him
[2:06:51] up and then when he gets up to the end
[2:06:54] of the day of the shoot he jumps out and
[2:06:57] the Sheep goes right on into the
[2:07:00] slaughter so we find that a sheep cannot
[2:07:04] find his way around he said now I
[2:07:06] remember experience I had is one time he
[2:07:08] said I was a state game warden in
[2:07:10] Indiana and I had I had been out in the
[2:07:12] field and I heard something the most
[2:07:15] pitiful cry and he said it was a little
[2:07:18] lamb had lost his mama and he couldn't
[2:07:22] find his way to her and the mother
[2:07:25] couldn't find her way to the little lamb
[2:07:28] and I picked the little fellow up and
[2:07:31] how quiet he laid against me and I went
[2:07:35] along there my hands holding little
[2:07:37] fellow and crying and I heard him how he
[2:07:42] just snuggled his little head down
[2:07:43] against me and it seemed like he knew
[2:07:46] that that I was going to help
[2:07:49] he said the Prophet said I thought all
[2:07:51] Rock of Ages cleft for me pick me up in
[2:07:56] the arms of the Lord Jesus just be
[2:07:59] content as I know I'm going home to be
[2:08:02] with my loved ones I thought that at the
[2:08:04] end of my life's journey Lord just bring
[2:08:07] me into your arms Lord just like that he
[2:08:10] said that I know I'll be carried across
[2:08:12] the river then they on the other side
[2:08:15] where there be no more sorrows and
[2:08:17] sicknesses and things that I'll be loved
[2:08:20] with the loved ones that I've loved
[2:08:22] isn't alright
[2:08:23] it was a prophet picking up a lamb and
[2:08:26] so tender and so vulnerable and that's
[2:08:30] how we are in the arms of God sometimes
[2:08:33] we think we know it all
[2:08:34] sometimes our knowledge put us up on a
[2:08:37] pedestal almost or maybe we put other
[2:08:39] people up on a pedestal trusting in them
[2:08:42] instead of trusting in the Lord
[2:08:44] trusting in your hopes your dreams
[2:08:47] trusting in your ability or maybe own
[2:08:49] achievements but not trusting in the
[2:08:51] Lord enough for him to take you into his
[2:08:54] hands and to guide you and to lead you
[2:08:58] jesus said unless you be like a little
[2:09:00] child you can no wise enter into the
[2:09:03] kingdom of God you know sometimes I was
[2:09:06] driving in my car I'm driving
[2:09:08] Eden to school and she's in the backseat
[2:09:11] sometimes she's just quiet staring out
[2:09:13] the window and I thought my God how
[2:09:16] innocent she's trusting that I'm not an
[2:09:19] evil person and I'm not gonna do any
[2:09:22] harm
[2:09:23] and I'm not gonna do her wrong she's
[2:09:24] just trusting she can't lead herself she
[2:09:28] can't carry herself to school she can't
[2:09:30] carry herself to the road or wherever
[2:09:32] she's trusting that whoever in charge
[2:09:35] knows what they are about and that what
[2:09:38] faith is all about this morning a trust
[2:09:41] in God
[2:09:42] that he is able to make a way out for
[2:09:44] you that in every temptation he makes a
[2:09:48] way of escape but then that love him Oh
[2:09:52] hallelujah for his loved ones Oh
[2:09:54] hallelujah Holly just trust and believe
[2:09:56] this morning
[2:09:58] and even though the devil trying to
[2:09:59] shake you try to get into your mind try
[2:10:02] to tell you can't make it the word stand
[2:10:05] sure forever and ever
[2:10:07] there's power in the word this morning
[2:10:10] to keep you in your trial in your test
[2:10:14] in your situation the power of the word
[2:10:18] is able to keep your feet from falling
[2:10:21] this morning there's power in the world
[2:10:25] hallelujah isn't the prophet said it's
[2:10:30] like a policeman
[2:10:30] he doesn't have power to stop the car
[2:10:33] but he has authority he might be a
[2:10:36] scrawny little fellow he might be a four
[2:10:39] foot five foot something maybe he's a
[2:10:41] dwarf it doesn't matter if he has on a
[2:10:44] uniform and he has a badge issued by the
[2:10:48] government of the country then he's got
[2:10:51] the authority vested in him as an
[2:10:54] officer of the law and if he gets out
[2:10:57] into that road and puts his hand up that
[2:11:00] car has to stop you have to come out of
[2:11:03] the vehicle oh because he's backed by
[2:11:06] the law and that's who we are this
[2:11:08] morning God is gonna have a people in
[2:11:11] this landscape whose power the Pope
[2:11:14] could be in you hallelujah praise call
[2:11:18] him hallelujah now we know that power is
[2:11:26] coming but right now you have power in
[2:11:28] the form of this world here everything
[2:11:32] that he died for it's written in this
[2:11:34] book everything that he died for he paid
[2:11:38] the price for it's belongs to you this
[2:11:40] morning hallelujah hallelujah and we
[2:11:46] said on Wednesday night when we were
[2:11:49] here talking about that lamb and he was
[2:11:53] stood upon the throne said who is worthy
[2:11:55] to take the book and to loose the seals
[2:11:57] thereof and John began to weep
[2:12:00] John knew that all nature had fallen
[2:12:04] because a man that was entrusted with
[2:12:06] his power and Dominion had forfeited it
[2:12:10] but when he forfeited it he gave up the
[2:12:13] D to the earth and the devil tried to
[2:12:17] grab it with his greasy hands but he
[2:12:20] couldn't hold on to it that title deed
[2:12:23] didn't stay there but it went back to
[2:12:26] the hands of the original owner
[2:12:30] Hollander is not and here was the
[2:12:32] original owner sitting on the throne he
[2:12:36] who is ready to loose the seals thereof
[2:12:38] in this title key to the earth lay our
[2:12:42] Dominion lay our inheritance lay our
[2:12:46] promises in this title deteriorate later
[2:12:50] pop system of the Holy Ghost glory
[2:12:52] hallelujah hallelujah your family's
[2:12:55] gonna deliver right in that book your
[2:12:58] husband your wife your loved one your
[2:12:59] children whatever you ask for it shall
[2:13:02] be done until you the authority of the
[2:13:05] sons of God was leaning it was leaning
[2:13:14] there I'm John knew it but he couldn't
[2:13:21] do anything about it the Bible said he
[2:13:24] wept much it's not right because there
[2:13:27] was no man found worthy to open the book
[2:13:31] neither to loose the seals thereof just
[2:13:34] think about it
[2:13:35] no in heaven none on the earth none had
[2:13:39] the right none had the kinsman redeemer
[2:13:42] shipwrights to do what was required
[2:13:46] because it had to be one of us it had to
[2:13:51] be a kinsman redeemer somebody would
[2:13:54] flesh like us somebody who make mistakes
[2:13:59] but Jesus made no mistake when he came
[2:14:03] he came as flesh he was subject to
[2:14:06] temptation he was something to triumph
[2:14:08] but here he learned obedience but it
[2:14:11] sinks he suffered and he came closer to
[2:14:13] God and he cannot walk talk or work with
[2:14:15] God I've got to work with him and he
[2:14:18] said I do nothing unless the father show
[2:14:20] me and he was used by God
[2:14:23] though he was tempted though he was
[2:14:26] tempted saw though he grown with a
[2:14:28] headache sometimes though he was tired
[2:14:30] yet and obedience he subjected himself
[2:14:33] to the Word of God he had power to do
[2:14:38] whatever he wanted
[2:14:39] yet he was obedient to the voice of God
[2:14:42] he walked all over the place and healed
[2:14:45] one man because he did nothing unless
[2:14:48] the father show him how was the kind of
[2:14:51] son he was oh it's not and someone
[2:14:56] tapped John on the shoulder and said
[2:14:58] weep not for the Lion of the tribe of
[2:15:00] Judah had prevailed to open the book and
[2:15:03] when he turned to look for a lion he saw
[2:15:07] all and bleeding bloody slain pizza his
[2:15:14] blood poured out for us his blood poured
[2:15:17] out for you but that lamb went all the
[2:15:20] way to the throne and took the book and
[2:15:29] [Music]
[2:15:31] John said all in heaven all on the hood
[2:15:35] I can't praise Cooke hood I can worship

[3:20:05] and we certainly want to remind the
[3:20:07] church that we are just about three
[3:20:10] months away from our convention or
[3:20:12] annual convention and we do continue to
[3:20:16] solicit your support your financial
[3:20:18] support towards the convention towards
[3:20:21] the meetings knowing that one of these
[3:20:23] days we would have a last convention if
[3:20:25] it's God's will we don't know this might
[3:20:27] be the last convention before we leave
[3:20:29] here because I believe we are walking on
[3:20:31] the Kings Highway and just like Enoch
[3:20:34] one day he was walking and just walking
[3:20:36] and then he found himself no longer
[3:20:37] touching the earth because he was
[3:20:39] walking to another dimensions another
[3:20:41] place so while we could do all we can do
[3:20:44] we want to do all that we can do because
[3:20:47] it will come a time when our strengths
[3:20:49] will be limited our efforts will be
[3:20:51] limited and then it'll be all over and
[3:20:54] then we switch over to that side so
