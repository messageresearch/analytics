[29:13] a christian that's right
[29:14] that meant so much to me because that
[29:16] that is my testimony
[29:18] but i have to be
[29:20] you know you can be anywhere you just
[29:22] live your life
[29:23] and

[30:06] back from africa and i was telling him
[30:08] on the phone the other day and said i
[30:09] feel like there's a the level of
[30:11] anointing has increased
[30:14] just my personal testimony
[30:16] but
[30:17] we're in a new season we're stepping up
[30:19] it just we're climbing that pyramid
[30:22] coming up into that holy ghost
[30:26] and it won't be us anymore friends
[30:30] i just would like to welcome brother
[30:32] over to the pulpit this morning
[30:34] and having him share what the lord has
[30:36] on his heart
[30:37] with us
[30:40] let's sing that song
[30:42] amazing grace how sweet the sound
[30:44] because it was god's grace
[30:46] it saved a wretch like me

[31:31] grace
[31:50] foreign
[32:05] too many dangerous toys
[32:54] that's jesus
[32:59] hallelujah
[33:36] see gross darkness covered in earth
[33:39] we see across darkness cover the people
[33:41] you see nations and kingdoms and kings
[33:43] and presidents they don't know what to
[33:46] do
[33:47] a time of trouble
[33:49] or upon the earth
[34:05] break the sluggishness
[34:06] break the deadness
[34:08] bring the coldness out of us
[34:10] sanctify us lord
[34:12] lord we thank you for the specials
[34:15] oh god that the portable work on us
[34:17] the lord that the alabaster
[34:24] to worship king lamb
[34:26] father bless the singers lord
[34:28] bless the worshippers your father for
[34:30] your long for the people to worship you
[34:32] in spirit and the truth
[34:34] come into your word and speak to our
[34:36] hearts in jesus name
[34:49] you want to go to isaiah chapter 61
[34:53] isaiah 28
[34:55] revelation 22. isaac 61 102
[34:59] 28
[35:00] already from fourteen to twenty two
[35:03] average
[35:26] 61.
[35:30] spirit of the lord god is upon me
[35:33] because the lord had anointed me preach
[35:35] good times unto the link
[35:37] yet assembled
[35:39] openhearted
[35:40] to proclaim liberty to the captives
[35:55] was 14.
[36:22] ourselves
[36:24] therefore saith the lord god behold in
[36:27] zion for a foundation of stone
[36:29] a dried stone the precious comes to
[36:32] a sure foundation
[36:34] he that believeth shall be like
[36:37] judgment also rarely
[36:47] and your covenant with death shall be
[36:49] disarmed and your agreement with hell
[36:51] shall not stand
[37:03] shall pass over by day and by night it
[37:06] shall be of excession
[37:21] he shall be wrought as an invalid given
[37:24] that he may do his work his strange work
[37:27] and bring the past his act his strange
[37:31] part
[37:32] now therefore be nothing
[37:33] release your hands remain strong for
[37:36] have heard from the word of god
[37:51] and the spirit and the blessing come
[37:54] that he will hear it see come let him
[37:57] when the things come and whoever will
[38:00] let him take
[38:01] the word of life
[38:45] last night i kind of stumbled into your
[38:47] second message preaching germany last
[38:49] year when you were identifying the
[38:51] ministry of jesus christ quite inspiring
[38:53] and when you made the remark that they
[38:56] have been coming up on my heart lately
[38:58] there's a 5-4
[39:26] the same if you will stand
[39:30] after you receive the holy ghost and
[39:33] make yourself a christian
[39:36] and act like a christian
[39:39] so this ties in perfectly with what
[39:44] he said make yourself a christian and
[39:47] act like a christian
[39:49] if you will put your faith in god's word
[39:52] and your eyes towards heaven and let
[39:54] your
[40:21] god will let the
[40:39] the brother says this quote
[40:41] takes away complacency
[40:44] and premature self-appointed pleasing
[40:48] making all to keep striving and to
[40:51] behave ourselves i'm just in love
[40:55] hallelujah
[40:56] hallelujah in other words we have not
[40:58] attained we press towards the map
[41:01] hallelujah hallelujah
[41:03] said not that i have a team i pressed
[41:06] towards the mark
[41:07] and the coach he called it was from
[41:09] an adoption time 1983 i think his 12th
[41:12] of november 11th in december
[41:14] uh the lord's messenger was in the
[41:16] lord's message you can't separate it and
[41:18] when that messenger stays in that
[41:20] message that message becomes part of him
[41:23] and what's the bride's message
[41:26] seven living voices
[41:29] when that becomes part of you then the
[41:31] anointing is with you charity is with
[41:34] you and can't know minister paul
[41:38] and i said this yesterday can't no
[41:40] minister put this into you
[41:43] unless it's already anointed in him
[42:00] it can't be there we had 40 years of
[42:03] that
[42:04] we are talking about something different
[42:05] that's right hallelujah we're talking
[42:08] about future power
[42:10] men empowered by god
[42:12] to be channels of communications
[42:24] there is my spirit flowing freely to
[42:28] begin with
[42:34] so what he can't point into you by
[42:36] revelation he's got to point to you by
[42:38] experience it's got to be something that
[42:42] he has
[42:43] silver and gold have i none such as i
[42:46] have i give it unto you then you'll have
[42:49] to take note that that man has been with
[42:51] jesus
[42:52] oh he's not wonderful
[42:54] praise god this is from a message called
[42:57] inheritance preach june 20th
[43:02] now you mean omnipotent speaking yes and
[43:05] the miraculous does confirm it
[43:08] not just taking all the quotes and
[43:10] scriptures and putting them together
[43:12] perfectly more than that it needs here
[43:15] we go the miraculous
[43:17] to confirm or the for it to make it come
[43:20] to pass to vindicate and to confirm it
[43:23] so nobody can get that confirmation
[43:53] i know he's among you
[43:55] not me i don't have to be here for him
[43:57] to move in
[43:59] all right i will say it again
[44:02] i don't have to be here for christ who
[44:05] is
[44:17] oh
[44:35] come i'm not saying coming
[44:37] i'm listening to spirit in the brain
[44:40] subject
[44:41] restoration and judgment
[44:43] and uh
[44:45] oh it's a tough one but god
[44:58] [Music]
[45:01] you have to click the refresh button
[45:45] experience
[45:48] to break and napoleon and effective
[45:52] these promises i couldn't stand here in
[45:54] front of you today
[45:56] i couldn't have the resentment and
[45:58] inspiration
[46:12] vision that
[46:25] here we go
[46:34] these messages are not directed to any
[46:37] certain individual
[46:39] and we wouldn't want people to think
[46:42] that we are sort of clan
[46:44] or a bunch of fanatics that they gather
[46:47] ourselves together
[46:48] to separate ourselves seemingly not
[46:50] having defeat
[46:52] or serving ourselves against anyone or
[46:55] against god or against the church
[46:59] we are
[47:00] for the church
[47:01] but we are only trying to point out by
[47:03] the holy spirit and himself the reason
[47:07] for this segregation that we have today
[47:18] [Music]
[47:37] which that we have all separated out
[47:41] we believe that it should be together as
[47:44] one great united group of the body of
[47:46] jesus christ
[47:48] now that's a different thing now you say
[47:50] body of jesus christ okay
[47:53] waiting for that glory is coming they
[47:55] should not be separated at all
[47:58] and what separates it
[48:01] there is born to be some basic reason
[48:04] that we are not together
[48:06] and in studying it i realized in
[48:08] studying it it's not the colors of our
[48:10] skin
[48:11] because yellow black brown and white all
[48:13] separate in different organizations it's
[48:15] not the kind of food we eat we all eat
[48:17] the same food we wear
[48:27] of the gospel each man
[48:30] and they ought to be some way to
[48:32] definitely show which is right and wrong
[48:34] and the only way you'll ever do it is
[48:37] not to put an interpretation to the word
[48:39] but read it the way it is
[48:41] and believe it that way
[48:43] each man put in his own interpretation
[48:46] makes it see something different and
[48:48] brings it back to the original
[48:50] organization of the catholic church
[48:52] which the catholic church believes that
[48:54] god is in the church
[48:57] and the word has nothing to do with it
[49:01] god
[49:02] is in
[49:03] his church now we may think about jesus
[49:06] but what we have in mexico is the same
[49:08] thing that's right because when you give
[49:09] people the word they don't take the word
[49:11] they say no we believe this
[49:13] but god is the world in the beginning
[49:16] was the word it was with god and the
[49:19] word was god so this is brother branham
[49:22] we protest and we find revelation 17 all
[49:25] of them together that the catholic
[49:27] church was the mother of organizations
[49:29] and we see that the protestant
[49:31] organization blindly has the same nature
[49:34] of the catholic church
[49:36] the bible called the catholic church
[49:39] and called the protestant church
[49:41] and that the was the mother of
[49:43] hearts and that is people that is
[49:46] ill-famed woman who doesn't live true to
[49:48] her my referrals we all claim to be the
[49:51] bride of christ
[49:52] and yet so untrue
[49:55] what would make the untrueness by living
[49:58] here we go not by talking by living
[50:00] contrary to the discipline that god has
[50:03] laid out for his bride to live by
[50:07] that's my own opinion the bible and his
[50:10] informal word of
[50:12] and therefore we find out that the
[50:14] protestant church in order to have an
[50:15] organization
[50:17] separate itself even from the scriptures
[50:19] to make our organization
[50:21] ministers or they will hold to those
[50:23] things and they come
[50:38] do i'll be begging bread in other words
[50:41] he's getting a salary from the church
[50:43] and he can't make a stand because if
[50:45] he'd make a stand he'd get cut off and
[50:47] he'll be begging bread now watch i've
[50:49] got a ministry i've got to get to the
[50:51] lord i've got to get to the people i
[50:54] have no backing up do you realize that
[50:56] christ is our backing up
[50:58] the bible is our backing up then you see
[51:00] the protestant church is exactly the
[51:02] same thing that cognitive is
[51:04] praise the name of the lord
[51:06] oh
[51:09] this is what is happening today
[51:11] praying in the name of the lord but a
[51:13] random testimony will eternal god he's
[51:15] praying what else could we expect of
[51:17] judgment
[51:18] when the mercy is overstep then judgment
[51:20] must come and god i pray that you enjoy
[51:23] your people together with the chords of
[51:25] love and bind your hearts together that
[51:27] soon when gabriel walks to that green
[51:30] baptist
[51:31] my friends
[52:14] in the air
[52:28] he said your church come together and go
[52:30] up to meet him in the air before the
[52:32] great judgment shall blast the earth
[52:34] with the graces of god oh god have mercy
[52:36] he said there are many here tonight have
[52:38] the last opportunity grant lord that
[52:40] they will be saved tonight and filled
[52:42] with thy spirit very simples we need be
[52:45] healed tonight drunk lord and little
[52:47] scream go up lord until tomorrow that i
[52:49] seek to be awakened with great
[52:50] testimonies anoint yourself and then if
[52:53] i fall with you lord i pray you senator
[52:55] portion tonight that i will not i will
[52:58] not be speaking but let the holy spirit
[53:01] speak
[53:02] oh blessed be the name of the lord
[53:04] let's continue from revelation chapter
[53:06] four
[53:08] that garden the tree of life and he's
[53:10] talking about i want you to notice that
[53:12] he said that they are interested in
[53:14] keeping the tree of life he said they
[53:16] kept the tree of life and that's the way
[53:18] of life now i want to show you a link
[53:21] this is an altar business
[53:40] he expressed
[53:47] so jesus was the expression of god
[53:50] so god wanted to reveal himself that was
[53:52] one of his goals
[54:09] were to keep that and grant that
[54:11] to get back there
[54:13] you know always the only way you can get
[54:15] back by the altar it must be covered
[54:37] altar
[54:38] was a judgment seat
[54:41] in eden
[54:42] it was not a mercy seat
[54:44] it was always a judgment scene but the
[54:46] blood on it
[54:49] [Music]
[54:51] on earth is what make it a mercy seat
[54:54] so we only have mercy because there is
[55:09] [Music]
[55:17] and the truth
[55:18] is but if we confess ourselves he is
[55:21] faithful and just to forgive us from our
[55:24] sins and to cleanse us of all
[55:26] unrighteousness
[55:38] [Applause]
[55:44] reveal himself in christ in her bride to
[55:47] take her back to eden let's say it again
[55:49] god so mysterious elohim reveal himself
[55:52] in christ then come to a bride and take
[55:54] her back to eden listen to this the only
[55:57] thing will enter into this gate of eden
[55:59] will be through the blood of jesus
[56:01] christ
[56:02] so to get back to either you have to
[56:04] come to the altar you have to come to
[56:06] the blood there is no other way but the
[56:08] fire oh give the lord some praise people
[56:11] oh
[56:12] hallelujah
[56:14] amen and paul told timothy in 2nd
[56:16] timothy 4 he said preach the word be
[56:18] instant in season out of season rebuke
[56:22] reprove exhort with all long suffering
[56:24] and doctrine for the time will come when
[56:27] they will not endure song doctrine but
[56:30] after their own lust shall he unto
[56:32] themselves teachers having eaten ears
[56:35] and they shall turn away their heirs
[56:37] from the truth and shall be turned on
[56:39] the fables but watch them in all things
[56:42] and draw
[56:43] do the work of the evangelists make full
[56:45] proof of your ministry
[56:48] you know if you split when the church
[56:51] gets away from the world it will believe
[56:53] anything
[56:55] amen anything all right this is what we
[56:57] see today
[56:59] now i just want to kind of dig back into
[57:02] listen's message and not even really
[57:03] complete it but i was talking about a
[57:06] goal that you could pursue and we're
[57:08] going to talk about the mechanics all
[57:10] that we could do
[57:39] praise god
[57:42] exodus 3 2 the angel of the lord

[57:51] roman manual
[57:52] speaking
[58:01] [Music]
[58:05] god sent an angel unto jesus to destroy
[58:08] and as he was destroyed the lord be held
[58:10] and he repented
[58:12] him of the evil and sent to the angels
[58:14] it is enough
[58:16] stick your hand
[58:17] so when god commissioned an angel
[58:59] there is no such thing as a holy
[59:09] oh

[59:50] opened the prison doors brought them out
[59:53] angel doesn't come just to come and say
[59:55] the angel is there the angel come to
[59:57] pull you off the prison

[1:00:39] which is god himself

[1:00:57] the keepers before the door kept the
[1:01:00] prison and behold the age of the lord
[1:01:01] came upon him and shine right in the
[1:01:03] prison he smote peter on the side raised
[1:01:07] him up saying arise quickly and his
[1:01:09] chains fell off his hands and the angel
[1:01:11] said unto him great thyself and bind on
[1:01:14] my standards and so he did and he said
[1:01:16] cast thy comment about and follow me
[1:01:19] that's the angel
[1:01:20] oh hallelujah
[1:01:22] praise god this is the amplified and
[1:01:24] when they had passed through the first
[1:01:25] guard and the second they came to an
[1:01:27] iron gate which leads into the city of
[1:01:29] its own accord the gates were moving
[1:01:31] and they went out and passed on one
[1:01:33] street and at once the angel left him
[1:01:41] israel 1947 and when the age of the lord
[1:01:44] spoke to me last time speaking by the
[1:01:46] way night before last i see them again

[1:05:52] all right what is the holy ghost there's
[1:05:54] a vast difference between a christian
[1:05:57] and a holy ghost filled christian all
[1:05:59] right now we're going to get this on the
[1:06:01] scripture and visit exactly the
[1:06:02] scripture the first place is a christian
[1:06:05] that professed to be a christian but if
[1:06:07] this christian has not yet been filled
[1:06:10] with the holy ghost he is only in the
[1:06:12] process of becoming a christian
[1:06:15] he's a professor believe it he has woken
[1:06:18] to it but god has not yet given him this
[1:06:21] spirit of the holy ghost he has not yet
[1:06:24] reached that glory with god
[1:06:27] so you've got to press
[1:06:29] the kingdom is preached
[1:06:43] yes
[1:07:10] the holy ghost is your possession
[1:07:16] speaking about this woman
[1:07:18] perseverance
[1:07:19] blood issue woman she had many
[1:07:20] hindrances and if you happen to think
[1:07:22] about it a faint didn't have any
[1:08:08] she had a promise and she had a
[1:08:10] determination this was the last chance
[1:08:13] and mommy ran out and she got to
[1:08:15] something she began to push and there
[1:08:17] was a big tall guy standing there she
[1:08:19] said excuse me amen he said no i don't
[1:08:22] believe that man preaching
[1:08:50] i don't care what
[1:09:03] he's a baptizer he can set you free he
[1:09:06] is a winner he's the same yesterday
[1:09:10] forever
[1:09:28] her faith had no hindrances
[1:09:30] fate
[1:09:31] doesn't know him
[1:09:47] like the cell phone you have a nice cell
[1:09:48] phone it's nice it's the latest it's big
[1:09:50] it's broad and everything else but if
[1:09:51] it's not activated
[1:09:53] you might as well use them all thank you
[1:09:55] just like that yeah because that can't
[1:09:57] call anybody they've got to get it
[1:09:59] activated
[1:10:10] get activated
[1:10:28] if
[1:10:36] to achieve anything you've got to set a
[1:10:38] goal
[1:10:40] that's right
[1:10:56] all right
[1:11:53] to open up the eyes of the prayer
[1:11:55] jesus come the scripture
[1:11:57] and today the bride will find the
[1:11:59] scripture
[1:12:00] to declare the offendings of allah
[1:12:21] is going to be restoration and judgment
[1:12:22] that's why it will not the brand they're
[1:12:24] going to be a call from revelation 2017
[1:12:27] a call of blood a call of mercy but flip
[1:12:30] that over the bride will pick up the
[1:12:32] avengers the path of jesus
[1:12:48] your goal is to come in the knowledge of
[1:12:50] the son of god onto a perfect man into
[1:12:53] your measure of the stature of a perfect
[1:12:56] man brother branham said this is
[1:12:58] perfection now this is always random
[1:13:01] talk about perfection from products he
[1:13:14] couldn't stay there
[1:13:28] you see
[1:13:29] once a turn into
[1:13:48] [Music]
[1:13:58] they want to speak to him
[1:14:22] john said there is one standing among
[1:14:24] you he shall baptize you with the holy
[1:14:26] ghost and
[1:14:35] that's what we want in our churches
[1:15:21] also
[1:15:36] is
[1:15:44] [Applause]
[1:15:49] see woman
[1:15:50] moving under the power of the holy
[1:15:51] spirit if something is done wrong they
[1:15:53] will quickly come and confess it before
[1:15:55] the spirit got ahold of it amen praise
[1:15:57] god that's the truth of the world oh my
[1:16:00] poor heart is getting old i've been
[1:16:02] wrong
[1:16:03] i've changed like that perfect works of
[1:16:05] god without sin
[1:16:08] oh hallelujah jesus did the works of his
[1:16:10] father because the father was in him
[1:16:12] that's why the work was done
[1:16:14] he was the incarnate god do you believe
[1:16:17] that
[1:16:18] god the father which is the father of
[1:16:20] jesus the great spirit
[1:16:22] dwelt in the fullness of his power in
[1:16:24] jesus christ which was the tabernacle of
[1:16:27] god
[1:16:28] so jesus
[1:16:29] was god's talent
[1:16:46] [Music]
[1:16:50] he is the head of the body who is the
[1:16:53] church so when he's at church we're
[1:16:55] talking about a body when we say body
[1:16:57] we're talking about one spirit we are
[1:16:59] baptized into the body and he becomes
[1:17:02] your head
[1:17:03] not headquarters in this church or some
[1:17:05] man in your head jesus is your head
[1:17:09] he becomes your headship he's a headship
[1:17:12] over the body he's a great magnet to
[1:17:14] connect with you and then when you
[1:17:17] become perfect he connects with you and
[1:17:19] we raise the dead you're going to fall
[1:17:22] out from the prayer we're going to pull
[1:17:24] them off from the grave because you are
[1:17:26] going to become the magnet
[1:17:28] stay without
[1:17:56] now listen and the word was invisible
[1:18:00] listen close the world was invisible
[1:18:03] until it was made flesh then the word
[1:18:05] become
[1:18:11] there he visible forward now truly
[1:18:13] sacrificial death recovery
[1:18:15] and his resurrection
[1:18:17] positionally
[1:18:18] placed his church in that realm
[1:18:22] that the same invisible god
[1:18:25] could come into the individual right
[1:18:28] all right
[1:18:29] [Applause]
[1:18:31] amen
[1:18:33] coming to the
[1:18:35] individual and make the world visible
[1:18:39] i wish my church would get that if you
[1:18:41] could see it friends the invisible god
[1:18:44] made visible
[1:18:45] then we could say sirs we will see jesus
[1:18:49] so friends
[1:18:50] do you understand
[1:18:52] your message amen the invisible god was
[1:18:55] the word
[1:18:56] ministry of the words
[1:18:59] now it's made visible by the ministry of
[1:19:02] the spirit
[1:19:06] hallelujah so always god is invisible
[1:19:09] when it's just worth it but when the
[1:19:11] music of the spirit which we are moving
[1:19:13] into you will see that invisible
[1:19:16] becomes visible
[1:19:20] which we are not breaking into it
[1:19:22] oh hallelujah hallelujah
[1:19:25] what spirit the spirit is upon me
[1:19:31] not looter not wesley not pentecost but
[1:19:34] the spirit itself
[1:19:36] comes upon our brain
[1:19:39] underground
[1:19:40] the spirit upon the prayers
[1:19:42] glory to god in heaven hallelujah
[1:19:55] [Music]
[1:20:17] here we go to that perfection of the son
[1:20:19] of man here we go when husband and wife
[1:20:22] will be the same self persons right
[1:20:26] amen but
[1:20:28] explain what he means by that right
[1:20:29] after
[1:20:30] himself persons god
[1:20:33] will be so manifested into his brain
[1:20:37] his church they will be the same that's
[1:20:39] right oh glory hallelujah they are one
[1:20:42] now you see where we are at praise the
[1:20:44] name of the lord praise god seven
[1:20:47] rainbow and always
[1:20:49] looking for the money position
[1:20:52] when he says
[1:20:57] but he was not speaking about
[1:21:11] jesus
[1:21:24] yes
[1:21:43] oh
[1:22:02] oh
[1:22:17] in the united states would run around
[1:22:19] the gift that god has given us that is
[1:22:20] the holy ghost god's gift
[1:22:22] and if all the children would break down
[1:22:24] their barriers when running around the
[1:22:25] great gift of godly love and the baptism
[1:22:28] of the holy spirit it would be the
[1:22:30] greatest defense this nation could have
[1:22:33] right
[1:22:34] on all the scientists and atomic bombs
[1:22:35] they could invent
[1:22:37] so what god wants us to do all of us all
[1:22:39] right in our different denomination
[1:22:42] he'll keep on listening this is the
[1:22:43] winner yeah
[1:22:44] there isn't what says and see how much
[1:22:47] we believe this i'm not talking negative
[1:22:49] i think but i'm just still working
[1:22:52] this is what god wants us to do is to
[1:22:55] recognize one another
[1:22:57] as brothers and sisters
[1:23:00] rallying around this great great gift of
[1:23:02] god which is the holy ghost
[1:23:05] that comes with power and manifestation
[1:23:08] and demonstration of his presence right
[1:23:11] notice he didn't say quotes
[1:23:13] all right
[1:23:14] and teachings
[1:23:15] and mysteries
[1:23:17] and revelations you're not talking about
[1:23:19] that he's talking about rallying around
[1:23:21] the holy ghost that comes with power and
[1:23:23] manifestation and demonstration of his
[1:23:26] presence then there would not be one
[1:23:28] cruel word spoken against any move of
[1:23:31] god
[1:23:32] we will all be one in one great bundle
[1:23:34] of godly love and listen that is what
[1:23:37] it's going to take for the church to go
[1:23:39] to rapture
[1:23:43] so we are not going anywhere i am not
[1:23:46] going anywhere if i am separated from my
[1:23:49] resume
[1:23:50] something got a
[1:23:52] something got to take place we have got
[1:23:54] to have a reminder
[1:23:57] [Applause]
[1:23:59] and we are going to have a relay
[1:24:17] [Music]
[1:24:22] [Applause]
[1:24:42] heal the sick they are afraid to offer a
[1:24:45] gift i had great meetings great
[1:24:47] evangelical citizens and one souls
[1:24:49] jesus from wonders from those things
[1:24:51] many will come to me in that day and say
[1:24:53] lord i'm gonna cast out devils in your
[1:24:55] name in your name
[1:25:02] it takes more than the power of gifts
[1:25:05] it takes more than joining church
[1:25:08] and takes the birth of the holy spirit
[1:25:11] to break down our walls and unite us
[1:25:14] together as one christian body moving
[1:25:18] from one objective and one goal
[1:25:21] it takes the holy
[1:25:25] not ghost
[1:25:26] not books
[1:25:28] not to believe it the way others preach
[1:25:31] it it takes the holy ghost
[1:25:33] what did every minister preach this what
[1:25:35] if every man said break take this spirit
[1:25:37] and preach it to the
[1:25:39] tell the congregation it takes the holy
[1:25:41] land
[1:25:52] [Applause]
[1:25:52] [Music]
[1:25:53] [Applause]
[1:26:06] i don't want to be anybody
[1:26:19] because you have to have faith in what
[1:26:21] god blessed you all
[1:26:22] you are this is the way that i am this
[1:26:25] is my calling this is how i preach i
[1:26:28] pray for the faith that god does i pray
[1:26:30] for the messenger
[1:26:31] i pray for the grace of god
[1:26:47] and when god made you he's the one of
[1:26:49] you oh give me the lord
[1:26:52] you are free this morning you are free
[1:26:54] to shout you are free to praise the
[1:26:56] living god
[1:26:58] oh hallelujah
[1:27:00] oh glory to god
[1:27:02] so it takes
[1:27:06] [Music]
[1:27:16] one purpose
[1:27:18] he wanted to achieve
[1:27:20] the entire bible
[1:27:22] amen is that right
[1:27:24] praise the lord
[1:27:26] and all the acts of the believers in the
[1:27:29] bible
[1:27:30] has been entitled expressing
[1:27:33] what god great goal is
[1:27:35] and now in the last days he reveals and
[1:27:38] shows it
[1:27:39] now you can't make the world contradict
[1:27:41] itself because in the beginning of the
[1:27:43] world
[1:27:44] the world was
[1:28:14] but when christ
[1:28:15] here we go he's identified in you
[1:28:18] identify himself then you are christ's
[1:28:20] life amen christ
[1:28:23] identified in you then you are christ's
[1:28:26] life
[1:28:27] which the word christian means to be
[1:28:29] christ-like there is your identification
[1:28:32] oh praise god not i believe this you are
[1:28:35] christ's side
[1:28:36] you see because somebody is christ like
[1:28:38] and let's say the belief is wrong when
[1:28:39] somebody show themselves
[1:29:06] i'm praying for you
[1:29:20] will give up on us
[1:29:48] foreign
[1:30:02] in order for them
[1:30:10] and the duck's gonna have fellowship
[1:30:22] [Music]
[1:30:37] [Music]
[1:31:01] from is the world
[1:31:03] because now once there's a word the word
[1:31:06] becomes a conductor of spirit so elohim
[1:31:09] thoughts the word the conductor of
[1:31:11] spirit but the spirit becomes through
[1:31:13] the world to make it visible
[1:31:18] oh
[1:31:22] [Applause]
[1:31:42] i
[1:31:53] that was his own inspiration
[1:31:55] let him lift the seal
[1:32:24] you are in
[1:32:26] [Applause]
[1:32:37] secondly to have the preeminence in a
[1:32:39] body of believers that it is bright that
[1:32:42] he could take us back to either to
[1:32:43] restore the kingdom isn't that right so
[1:32:46] god is the word is not right away from
[1:32:49] the prophets the word spoke to israel is
[1:32:51] not right blessed be

[1:41:23] this kingdom destroyed this body i'm
[1:41:26] going to see you there's a pride in
[1:41:28] pennsylvania
[1:41:51] and he was a sign of deliverance to
[1:41:53] israel
[1:41:54] and a sign of judgment
[1:41:57] even
[1:42:13] [Music]
[1:42:23] the very waters that choked the world
[1:42:25] drawn the world was the
[1:42:39] notice jesus he said is the inclinity of
[1:42:42] vengeance
[1:42:44] when jesus read the scripture
[1:42:50] but within that judgment of being right
[1:42:52] now
[1:42:53] there is a mercy
[1:42:55] under revelation 2017
[1:43:01] you see if i am not in
[1:43:03] i can still come in
[1:43:08] so
[1:43:21] you can't shake me
[1:43:30] [Applause]
[1:43:32] oh you are free this month
[1:43:34] oh wonderful wonderful
[1:43:41] israel
[1:43:42] there we go after 400 years
[1:43:46] remember what kind of promise to deliver
[1:43:47] right but here what happened after phone
[1:43:49] visible
[1:43:54] and god
[1:43:56] never reveals himself
[1:43:58] and shows himself until his people is
[1:44:02] ready to receive what he shows
[1:44:04] it is
[1:44:12] so it shakes you off from being
[1:44:13] complacent
[1:44:14] it shakes you from being lazy it shakes
[1:44:17] you from being just you know accepting
[1:44:19] god said it will come to pass no no no
[1:44:21] no no you're going to press
[1:44:25] reveal oh praise the name of the lord
[1:44:29] god will never meet with man
[1:44:31] unless but under the blood when you turn
[1:44:34] the blood down then your meeting place
[1:44:37] where god has been taken away
[1:44:39] god first decision in the garden of eden
[1:44:41] that man will only worship him under the
[1:44:42] shadow of sacrifice and that's the only
[1:44:44] place that god will meet man then and
[1:44:46] that's the only place god ever meets
[1:44:48] with man
[1:44:49] and the only place he meets with man
[1:44:51] today is under the shed blood of the
[1:44:53] sacrifice you see i don't care if you're
[1:44:55] messing this
[1:44:56] baptist presbyterian if you can forget
[1:44:59] your differences roman catholic whatever
[1:45:01] you might be i will come under the shed
[1:45:03] blood glory meet with both of us
[1:45:07] that is where we can all meet and
[1:45:09] fellowship on receiving grounds but
[1:45:10] otherwise he will not meet you because
[1:45:13] you are a methodist he will not meet you
[1:45:15] because you're pentecostal he will meet
[1:45:17] you under one condition how many believe
[1:45:20] that did you believe that in this
[1:45:21] message
[1:45:24] when you believe with them
[1:45:25] or you join their organization or join
[1:45:28] their group or join their church is as
[1:45:30] if god has been privatized
[1:45:54] because he's going everywhere
[1:46:11] and the blood is always with him and
[1:46:12] therefore he can only see you through a
[1:46:14] chapter your white is snow when you
[1:46:16] confess your sins otherwise you're not
[1:46:17] then you can't fellowship
[1:46:19] that's the reason you don't see things
[1:46:21] happen in the churches they confess that
[1:46:22] they believe the blood but they reject
[1:46:24] the plan to get to the blood of the word
[1:46:27] and there is only one we go with one of
[1:46:29] that word
[1:46:30] you will never say
[1:46:31] sound you can't do that the only way you
[1:46:33] can do is under the messages of god
[1:46:36] oh praise it right now
[1:46:38] from the indictment
[1:46:53] thee who is that the truth that they
[1:46:54] they found fought with the man who was
[1:46:56] the word is that right they fought forth
[1:46:58] with the man who was the world no
[1:47:00] defined for with the word working
[1:47:02] through the man now this is
[1:47:06] his ministry and god is working through
[1:47:07] him
[1:47:08] and people have rejected it and he will
[1:47:10] bring an indictment to each other stands
[1:47:13] across the world or abandons his word
[1:47:16] jesus lawyer has brought a indictment
[1:47:19] this is not me being elected
[1:47:33] okay so watch it for all of us so you
[1:47:36] say watch he said watch
[1:47:38] they fall forward the man who was the
[1:47:40] word now they find fault with the word
[1:47:41] working through the man
[1:47:43] which is the person the holy spirit will
[1:47:46] get through is called vindication
[1:47:49] here there it is today
[1:47:51] it strikes maybe some little man when it
[1:47:53] went off had a call of god he felt he
[1:47:56] went to some seminarians and creed he
[1:47:58] must live by that creed or give up his
[1:48:00] fellowship
[1:48:05] he is blackmart
[1:48:07] nobody else would have him because once
[1:48:09] he belonged to something else
[1:48:10] no he don't belong to it they figure
[1:48:12] there is something wrong with that man
[1:48:14] they will not have him in the
[1:48:15] congregation and when the congregation's
[1:48:16] only looking for one side here it is
[1:48:18] then the congregation only came on one
[1:48:20] side that is if he believes what they
[1:48:22] believe
[1:48:23] that's the only way he accepted him not
[1:48:25] if he's a minister like one time when
[1:48:27] iran went to a service
[1:48:29] and they heard
[1:48:59] oh it's not something else you say what
[1:49:01] they're doing today they're trying to
[1:49:02] push by the spirit they call for revival
[1:49:04] everywhere holy revival when the world
[1:49:07] itself can't go through the people
[1:49:09] how are you gonna build a platform here
[1:49:11] that they crucify him that
[1:49:21] jesus christ
[1:49:23] was the person
[1:49:25] man god
[1:49:26] here we go he was the manifestation of
[1:49:29] god he was god in body form to reflect
[1:49:32] the word for that age to make that ac
[1:49:35] growth for me for that age and the holy
[1:49:37] ghost today is the same thing
[1:49:39] it's the spirit of god upon the written
[1:49:42] word
[1:49:43] trying to find somebody to reflect
[1:49:46] itself
[1:49:47] do you understand what this means amen
[1:49:50] it's the spirit of god to come upon you
[1:49:53] that's right therefore this written word
[1:49:55] must become you
[1:49:56] then the spirit come upon you the pride
[1:49:59] is not the spirit it's the spirit and
[1:50:02] the brand
[1:50:04] is the word
[1:50:05] and the spirit comes upon the brag oh
[1:50:08] it's
[1:50:12] do you see it now
[1:50:14] jesus was the example son jesus said the
[1:50:17] spirit is upon me
[1:50:19] he had anointed me
[1:50:23] the bride will do the same thing
[1:50:25] therefore the spirit will drop on the
[1:50:27] brain
[1:50:28] and she will say the spirit is upon me
[1:50:32] [Music]
[1:50:33] i can know it is
[1:50:35] okay
[1:50:50] 4. he would raise up to turn the house
[1:50:52] of return back to the pentecostal
[1:50:54] fathers now i condemn you guilty and
[1:50:57] challenge you and indict you before god
[1:50:59] with wicked selfish nomination
[1:51:02] you have crucified the word of god
[1:51:03] before the people i call you guilty
[1:51:05] ready for judgment i call the same thing
[1:51:07] that peter did he called for repentance
[1:51:08] of that generation i call repentance to

[1:51:15] word come back to the faith of the

[1:51:21] my god and if i can stand and sit trying
[1:51:24] to challenge my precious minister and
[1:51:25] brother
[1:51:26] to come back to the holy ghost come back
