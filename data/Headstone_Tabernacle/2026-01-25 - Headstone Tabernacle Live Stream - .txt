Welcome to the house of the Lord. Uh we like to turn [music] our Bibles over to Psalms chapter 100 for a scripture reading this morning. A psalm of praise this morning. Amen. And I know you're familiar with it. So if you know it, say it along with me as we read this morning from the Holy Rit, Psalms 100. that says, "Make a joyful noise unto the Lord, all ye lands." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Serve the Lord with gladness. Come before his presence with singing. Know ye that the Lord he is God. [music] It is he that had made us and not we ourselves. [music] We are his people and the sheep of his pasture.

Our eyes are steadfast upon you, Lord. Father, Lord, to see what you would speak to us, Lord. We are ready in waiting this morning. Pour out your spirit this morning. Pour out your anointing, Father.

What a song. for the presence with you this morning and we are grateful. Amen. Praise God. God bless you. It's good to be home. I know you were blessed last week with the message from Pastor Ulu, the house that love built. Amen. Brother Steven Oliver sent me this testimony. God bless you, brother. I have a small testimony. I was listening to uh William Brown's message this week [music] and at the end he was praying for the sick and each time he was saying do you believe me to be [music] God's prophet God's servant I asked myself for a moment why is it that he had to ask each person that question it played on my mind a bit but today God in his great love for me explained the answer in such great detail it could not have been a better explained it was truly God thank support for the meeting every need through his word through his ministry. So praise God he was really blessed with brother's message and also we had three baptisms last Sunday and I was very pleased how this unfolded in the absence of brother Isaac and I. God bless you all and was very happy to hear the report. Amen. [applause] Also want to thank brother Steven uh for overseeing the baptism service and for brother Andy and for brother Adrian for conducting the baptisms and so on. [applause] You know when I was heard about the baptism and and brother but Isaac and I will be out. Um somebody said if we do when we come back I said not not at all the church have to move on. And this is what we want to see. We want to see that nothing must hinder &gt;&gt; what has to be done. Praise God. It's not the church is not built upon us. It built upon Jesus Christ the rock of revelation. Amen. &gt;&gt; Okay. So we also want to thank uh brother Sein Barandi, brother Adrian and also for brother Anthony songs at the baptism service. No brother Isaac was in Lagos Nigeria where he ministered in pastor de church and also pastor Lou's church and the Lord did bless tremendously. So last weekend I was in Miami in two churches in Miami and I preached on the latter rain is fixing to fall and um another message the restoration of the person of Christ to the bride by Malachi 4. Now in the latter rain fixing to fall just want to read a quote from it. What is the seed of life? The word of God. Therefore for life you can't come through a creed. You can't come through a denomination. You have got to come back to the word. This to do with a group thing. What church you go to on tabernacle have nothing to do with that. You've got to come back to the word now. The seed of life. All right. His word is a seed and his spirit is the water. So it's not just word word. The word is a seed, &gt;&gt; but the spirit is the water. &gt;&gt; Right back to John 3:13. Jesus is the word of God. Yeah. Here we go now. And he that was to be busted open that life. So Jesus just just didn't die at Calvary and pay the price. You know &gt;&gt; his that seed had to break open &gt;&gt; that life could be released and that's why you in this building this morning &gt;&gt; because his life is what reach you &gt;&gt; because no man could come except the father by his spirit pulls and draws and woos. So if the spirit had draw you can't come &gt;&gt; if the spirit haven't drawn you. You cannot come. &gt;&gt; You can only come because something is moving you. Remember the devil pulling to you now. Devil pulling downwards, God pulling upwards. &gt;&gt; So God pull you to get you where you are. &gt;&gt; You might be broken, but he still got you. &gt;&gt; You might be wounded, but he still got you. You may have dirt and mud on you, but he STILL GOT YOU. HE COULD clean you UP, BUT HE GOT YOU. Give the Lord some praises. There's no reason for anybody inside of here not to praise God this morning because HE GOT YOU. WHATEVER CONDITION IS, he got you. HE HAVE YOUR BACK. HE GOT YOU. &gt;&gt; OH, praise God. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Here we go now. Therefore, if the spirit of God comes forth to water the seed, if it's a seed, it's watering, it'll produce a life in the seed. &gt;&gt; Is that clear? It produce the life of the seed. And that's what is given for. &gt;&gt; Amen. And the restoration of the person of Christ by the bride by Malachi 4. God didn't sell God didn't send a prophet William Brandham for us to be preaching William Brandham. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's not the object. Brandon Brandon Brandom. I know the purpose. He sent a prophet. A prophet is for purpose. You know, as John the Baptist was sent to forun my coming, first coming, you have a message that was for my second coming. God sent William Brandham to introduce Jesus Christ. Let me say it good. God sent William Brham to introduce THE PERSON OF JESUS CHRIST. THE PENTECOSTALS ONLY HAD GIFTS. They didn't have the person &gt;&gt; because the person comes by the word &gt;&gt; and the word is in that pyramid there. &gt;&gt; FAITH AND VIRTUE AND KNOWLEDGE AND TEMPERANCE. THAT'S JESUS CHRIST. [cheering] [applause] &gt;&gt; So let me give you his own words here now. And my inspiration in that message was from the prophet to his prophecy. People stuck at the prophet. But what about the prophecy? &gt;&gt; The prophet that come to say I'm a prophet. I'm a prophet. I'm a prophet. You have a prophet. What are you doing with that? &gt;&gt; The prophet come the prophesy. &gt;&gt; Amen. You have to get from the prophet to the prophecy. &gt;&gt; All the time they were prophesying. Messiah coming. Messiah coming. Here come John the Baptist. He said, "Behold the lamb OF GOD." AND RIGHT THERE IT SWITCH FROM THE PROPHET &gt;&gt; to the prophecy. &gt;&gt; Follow him. &gt;&gt; Who him? Jesus Christ. Well, give the Lord some praises. &gt;&gt; This is the words of William Brham. We are not building an organization. I am not here this morning to build an organization. Christ never sent me to build an organization. Christ sent me to build individuals to the stature of Jesus Christ that they MIGHT BE A POWERHOUSE AND A DWELLING place of the spirit BY HIS WORD. HALLELUJAH. PRAISE GOD. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHAT GOD WANTS YOU TO BE A POWERHOUSE. NOT A DEPENDENT HOUSE, NOT A LOOSE HOUSE, A STACK HOUSE. I'm not HEARING YOU. GOD SENT YOU TO BE A [screaming] POWERHOUSE. POWERED BY THE SPIRIT, &gt;&gt; POWERED BY THE WORD, [cheering] [applause] &gt;&gt; not we Christians. All these drones they flying on all these drones with Ukraine and attacking. But these things are very accurate. You know, &gt;&gt; you could be emotional about essay writing and thing you got 90 or 80.

Not to follow some man, &gt;&gt; not to follow some church. BECAUSE THIS IS THE AGE of maturity. &gt;&gt; I can't say it here now. That's a whole message by itself. The reason the Pentecostals couldn't get the mystery is because he said they were begotten. &gt;&gt; You know what that means? They were in the womb. &gt;&gt; The baby had born yet &gt;&gt; up to now with all the million dollar billings they have, all the million dollar congregation they have, all the thousands and thousands, they're still failing and falling. They have no life &gt;&gt; because the LIFE COME BY THE WORD &gt;&gt; AND THE WORD COMES TO A PROPHET AND THEY TURN ON THE PROPHET. THEY TURN ON THE LIFE. [screaming] THEY HAVE CHURCH, THEY HAVE MILLION, THEY AIRPLANE, THEY HAVE THIS, THAT EVERYTHING YOU THINK ABOUT it and they still falling one by one. It has to fall, has to fail because man kingdom has coming down. DANIEL SAY I SEE A ROCK cut up without the hands of man. What you're about to see is without the hands of man.

[cheering] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; You may be seated. &gt;&gt; These stars falling into the constellation backyard that angel coming. I said, "And John the Bapt was sent to wind up the Old Testament and to bring forth the introduction of Christ, a message will wind up the loose ends &gt;&gt; and introduce the Messiah." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Just before his coming. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Introduce who? &gt;&gt; Messiah. &gt;&gt; Aha. You mean brother Brandham came to introduce the Messiah? &gt;&gt; That's right. The Messiah came down in Revelation 10. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. The Lord himself the seven of them with a shout with the book open AND SEVEN THUNDERS BUST OUT them books bust out those voices. Those voices was loosed to the bride together to get the bride faith TO SHOW THE BRIDE HOW TO PREPARE. THAT IS ONLY BRIGHT THING NOT BRIDE MAID BRIGHT THING. &gt;&gt; He come to get that bride. Go get that bride. &gt;&gt; There are millions of church members but the bride is a minority. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Praise God. So I was blessed to have to be in a ministers meeting over there also. So praise God. Uh very happy for what the Lord is doing and we can only expect greater things. So let's stand. We want to go into the word one scripture. This is the first time I think I only read on a one verse scripture here. So Galatians 4:19 just one verse. My little children of whom I travail in birth until Christ be formed in you. Let's bow our heads. Almighty God, we thank you for your word and your scriptures. And I pray you'd come down in a special way among your people. God, you know what you placed upon my heart and what to share. And I pray that you would honor your word this morning. Confirm it with signs, wonders, and miracles and report your Holy Spirit upon the lives of your children. May lives be changed here, Lord. May lives be transformed here that many come, they hear, they go back home, and all they do is hear. But I pray today that you would arrest them that they will go beyond hearing and they go to acting upon the word and receiving. Granted, Father, in Jesus name I ask it. Amen. You may be seated. Praise God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; I got a a note from a brother. I just a question that I'd like to read for you. Greetings, brother over in the precious name of Jesus. I pray that this correspondence meets you in good health and strength. I choose to write rather than speak so that my thoughts would be properly ordered and not come across as scattered. In the latter part of 2025, I've been making it a daily habit to listen to a message from the prophet or to one of our church services in its entirety. Did you hear that? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I get two amens. &gt;&gt; Because it say here, I made it a daily habit. &gt;&gt; You see before it comes unconscious habit or conscious doing, you have to consciously do it. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Because habit actually produces character in life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To listen to a message from the prophet or to one of our church services in its entirety. &gt;&gt; On January 19, 2026 around 7:15 p.m. While searching through YouTube under the tab title righteousness, I came across a trailer for our July 2020 virtual convention. I allowed it to play through its entirety and immediately after it ended, it transitioned into a sermon preached by you on May 15 prior to the convention. The title of the sermon was, "Let us cross Jordan to an open vision of another Ephesians." What struck me as unusual was that the sermon began playing from the middle of the service. From that message, what stayed with me most was that a as Christian believers seeking to attain the crown of adoption, we must cross Jordan with no shortcuts. The central theme of the sermon was death to self. Early the next morning, I awoke with a question pressing strongly upon my heart. Is the approach to Jordan intentional or is it by conditions? This brought to mind the prophet's statement, "If love does not get us, desperate &gt;&gt; conditions will." &gt;&gt; This question arose directly from what was preached in the sermon, particularly concerning debt to self and forsaking of certain comforts and desires of this life before crossing Jordan. Now, as the Lord Jesus said in Matthew 19:29, "And every one of you that had forsaken houses and brethren and sisters or father, mother or wife, children, or lands for my name's sake shall receive a hundfold and shall inherit everlasting life." The scripture I felt pressed to read that morning was Romans 8 in its entirety with verses 1 and 12 and 15, especially remaining with me. There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit. Therefore, brethren, we are debtors not to the flesh to live after the flesh. For if you live after the flesh, you shall die. But if you through the spirit do modify the deeds of the body, you shall live. For as many as are led by the spirit of God, they are the sons of God. For you have not received the spirit of bondage to fear, but you have received the spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Aba, Father. So my question remains, is this crossing of Jordan something that comes by divine conditions or by intentional surrender and obedience? I also reflected on brother Brandon's experience with his first encounter with Jesus own only Pentecostal people. When his mother-in-law warned him not to take her daughter among that, she considered such trash. The consequence of not obeying the voice of God and instead listening to his mother-in-law was extremely severe, the loss of his wife and daughter. I will appreciate I would greatly appreciate your thoughts and spiritual insight on this question. Yours sincerely in Christ, Brother Shane Williams. I love this question. So when I got this question, I said, "Bro Shane, I'll answer it, but I want to read this for the church." So is So I have this here. is crossing the Jordan by condition or by intentional surrender and obedience. So I want to answer this because this is important because of what I had in my heart to preach and this ties in straight perfect there. So let me give you the title of what I have here this morning. The title I have is when you are dying and Christ is coming to life. And the subject I have the age of dying out the death of a corner wheat. That's the subject I have tonight. &gt;&gt; Amen. The age of dying out. Now I know there's not um Okay. So let's just answer this question a bit. Is crossing the Jordan by condition or by intentional surrender and obedience? Joshua 1 2 and 3 God speaks. Moses my servant is dead. Now therefore arise, go over this Jordan. Now we saying Jordan, but Jordan represent debt. &gt;&gt; Do you understand that? &gt;&gt; All right. Go over this Jordan, thou and all this people into the land which I do give them, even to the children of Israel. Every place that the soul of your foot shall tread upon, that have I given unto you, as I said unto Moses. &gt;&gt; That is the big print. &gt;&gt; Every place you put your foot is yours. Right? &gt;&gt; The fine print is later on. We're not going to read it. It says meditate on the word day and night &gt;&gt; to have good success. &gt;&gt; So if you read the the top print all is yours and everything else. That sounds great. That sounds good. But you have to always look for the fine print &gt;&gt; where you're going to meditate when you're going to think about these things. Isn't that right? &gt;&gt; And the other scripture I have is from 2 Kings 2 and we know the story when Elijah told Elisha stay here and stay here and so on. But this these three verses here and Elijah said unto him tar I pray thee for the Lord has sent me to Jordan. So the man said stay at Betal stay at Gal stay at Jericho and he said I'm not staying &gt;&gt; now that's a brother with revelation. &gt;&gt; He's not saying the prophet tell me stay here I ain't moving. &gt;&gt; Oh no. So he's still moving. &gt;&gt; He dead where he is. &gt;&gt; You have to move sometimes. &gt;&gt; But you have to have revelation to move. &gt;&gt; And he had a revelation. He want more. Where that come from &gt;&gt; because Elijah took his mouth and drop it on him and pull it off. &gt;&gt; So something TOUCH HIM, &gt;&gt; SOMETHING HIT him and I hope something hit you this morning. &gt;&gt; That you will want you would want more OF WHERE THAT COME FROM. &gt;&gt; AMEN. Are you with me? &gt;&gt; So watch. Elijah said unto them, Tyrie, I pray thee, for the Lord had sent me to Jordan. And he said, as the Lord liveth, as thy so live, I will not leave thee. And they two went on. And 50 men of the sons of the prophets went and stood to view a far off and there two stood by Jordan. So there's al people to witness your dying. [laughter] &gt;&gt; There will always be people to witness your transformation. &gt;&gt; You're not going to be transformed in the dark. You know you No, no, no. There will be people seeing you dying &gt;&gt; that you're changing &gt;&gt; that your hot not your hot mouth not so hot no more. Amen. &gt;&gt; I got about six. Amen on that one. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You wouldn't be rude no more. You wouldn't be in discipline no more. &gt;&gt; All right. So, watch this. And Elijah took his mantle, wrap it together, smoke the waters, and they were divided and thither, and they two went on dry ground. &gt;&gt; Here we go. Giggal, Bethl, Jericho, then Jordan. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Three steps then die. &gt;&gt; Amen. Luther, Wesley, Pentecost, and then the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The corner wheat. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; The instruction was arise and go over this Jordan. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; So, it's not a question if we should die. &gt;&gt; We have to die. &gt;&gt; It's not taught in the message or preach much in the message. What you hear your bride &gt;&gt; and you the eye in the bride. &gt;&gt; I not seeing that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The bride is the Holy Ghost punch. &gt;&gt; Amen. The bride have the extra oil. &gt;&gt; The bride is not the foolish virgins &gt;&gt; or the stupid virgins. &gt;&gt; Brother, some of the prophets said to Elisha, "Do you know your master will be taken from you?" He say, "I know it, but hold your peace." &gt;&gt; He said, "I like that. I am going to stay right with him no matter what the rest of them say." &gt;&gt; Elijah turned around and said, "No, you t here for God is sending me to Jordan." Then brother Brown speak this three places justification gigal sanctification the school of the prophets and to the baptism of the holy ghost at Jordan where Jordan represents death notice Martin Luther John Wesley Pentecost and down to the Jordan &gt;&gt; dying out time &gt;&gt; so there's a time for you to receive the word there time for you to die out you start first with receiving the word there in the word you because you see you don't know God &gt;&gt; until God revealed himself to you. &gt;&gt; When Moses brought the people out, they had no clue who God is. &gt;&gt; Moses met God, &gt;&gt; not the people. &gt;&gt; The people were following a prophet CALLED MOSES BECAUSE HE MET THE PILLAR OF FIRE. BUT GOD TOLD THEM, "BRING THEM TO THIS mountain &gt;&gt; that I could talk to them, THAT I COULD SHOW MYSELF to them, THAT I COULD PROVE MYSELF TO THEM. BRING THEM TO THIS MOUNTAIN." OH, HALLELUJAH. THEREFORE, WHEN THE RED SEA WAS IN FRONT OF MOSES, MOSES WAS SUPPOSED TO KNOW BETTER BECAUSE WHEN GOD GIVE YOU A COMMISSION, NOTHING STOPS IT. NOTHING COULD HINDER IT. NOTHING COULD BLOCK IT. So when MOSES BEGAN TO CRY, HE SAID, "WHY CRY UNTO ME? SPEAK AND MOVE FORWARD." AND THEN THE [screaming] REST HAD TO OPEN UP BECAUSE GOD GAVE HIM A RETURN TICKET TO THAT MOUNTAIN. WHAT CAN THE LORD SHOUT IN THE HALLELUJAH? GOD DIDN'T GIVE HIM A ONEWAY TICKET TO EGYPT. HE GAVE A RETURN TICKET. GO TO EGYPT AND BRING THEM OUT. &gt;&gt; BRING THEM TO THIS MOUNTAIN. HALLELUJAH. AND GOD BROUGHT US A MOUNTAIN. &gt;&gt; MOUNT PYRAMID. LOOK AT THERE. &gt;&gt; THAT'S THE MOUNTAIN WE COME TO NOW. [applause and cheering] OH, GIVE THE LORD A SHOUT IN THE HOUSE. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; But the third stage is coming on. The church still follows on. Elijah. Elisha. Following Elijah down to the Jordan. Jordan the meaning of of separation or debt. You heard many times when I come down to the Chile Jordan. Jordan was debt. The Lutheran age followed by so did the Methodist age. But we come to another age now. &gt;&gt; I never said this before. I'm reading the age of dying out. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You see Wesley was dynamics of Lutheran. Pentecost was dynamic to the wesians. &gt;&gt; Every time God come on the scene, it changes what was passed. &gt;&gt; So when the word come, the Pentecostal birth was nothing. &gt;&gt; God pushed that back in the womb because now the word is required. &gt;&gt; You see, you can't go back and build an ark from like Noah's day saying rain coming. &gt;&gt; Young people say out of timing. Then &gt;&gt; for Noah's time, &gt;&gt; you understand I'm saying? You have to find out what is promised for this day. &gt;&gt; And fight up with God's requirement for this day. &gt;&gt; And this day, God requirement is perfection. [applause] &gt;&gt; I want you to say amen. Right with me now. Right with me now. &gt;&gt; THIS IS NOT CHURCH. PENTECOST TO Jehovah Witness and Baptist. THAT'S CHURCH. &gt;&gt; WE TALKING ABOUT PERFECTION. &gt;&gt; We not EVEN TALKING ABOUT SALVATION. WE TALKING ABOUT REDEMPTION. REDEMPTION IS TO BRING YOU BACK TO WHERE YOU were before. IT GOES BEYOND BEING SAVED. IT IS GOING BACK TO WHAT ADAM HAD. LET US MAKE MAN IN OUR IMAGE, OUR LIKENESS. LET THAT MAN have dominion over the fish, OVER EVERY CREEPING THING. YOU HAVE TO HAVE DOMINION, NOT ON THE OTHER SIDE. DOMINION IS NOT FOR THE OTHER SIDE. OH, DON'T GET ME STARTED THIS MORNING. DOMINION IS NOT FOR THE OTHER SIDE. LOVE AND JOY IS NOT FOR THE OTHER SIDE. YOU HAVE TO HAVE IT HERE. YOU HAVE TO EXERCISE IT HERE. YOU HAVE TO DISPLAY HERE. GOODNESS, GRACIOUSNESS. [cheering and applause] You're mean as the devil. You're stingy as Satan himself. You don't want to give nobody nothing. When you give, when you go in your side, when I go side, I will give. Who you giving to? Who you deceive him? &gt;&gt; I go love when I love your side. You hating down here now for now. &gt;&gt; The blood can't take this one. I cast on this one. &gt;&gt; [laughter] &gt;&gt; You are to want to love your enemies. &gt;&gt; Therefore, you can't be gossiping about enemies. Oh, God. She's the enemy of God. You don't do it. &gt;&gt; I thought you want to love your enemies. &gt;&gt; God set up the enemy's face of love. &gt;&gt; But you only complain about the enemy. Oh, God. The enemy of God. You call this one that stop it. Cut it out. That's the enemy. How you going to love that? [applause] Let me STICK YOU NOW. OR YOU COULD LOVE GOD WHO YOU CAN'T SEE AND YOU HAVE A PROBLEM TO LOVE YOUR BROTHER AND YOUR SISTER who right in front of your face who next door to you who behind you. You want to shake your hand. Oh, don't get ME STARTED THIS MORNING. YOU KNOW YOU HAVE TO DO better than that. YOU HAVE TO GET MORE MATURE THAN THAT. YOU HAVE TO GROW HARDER THAN THAT. [cheering and applause] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. My blood. &gt;&gt; The age of dying out. &gt;&gt; Are you ready? &gt;&gt; All your worldly pleasures. God has got to do something with you &gt;&gt; in order for he could give you the Holy Ghost. You got to die out and get dead. You don't die. You see, that is why the message will like Mary, be it done unto me according to your word. They love that &gt;&gt; because they have no work to do there. &gt;&gt; They have no work. &gt;&gt; That's nice. Baptist doctor according to your word. Yeah. Why Mary in the upper room? &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Because B say she had to die out, you know. &gt;&gt; She had to get all the prize. She's the mother of Jesus and you know she had to sit down next door to Mary Magdalene who had who and living with who and who had who and who [laughter] had who say Mary and B hallelujah glory and so on you know. OH GOD, DON'T LOOK AT ME STARTING here this morning, you know. Amen. HALLELUJAH. SO YOU CAN'T BE HALTY TOY WHILE YOU'RE PROUD AND you feel you're better than somebody. Yes. Spit them but YOU DON'T CARE. HALLELUJAH. WHO YOU THINK YOU ARE? YOU NEVER FORNICATE. You never adulterate. You never work but you never sin. You never that make you special. &gt;&gt; All have sinned. In case you're misreading the Bible, not some. All have sinned. AND COME SHORT OF THE GLORY. BEHAVE YOURSELF. &gt;&gt; Even if you say amen, a sin, you behave yourself. &gt;&gt; Behave yourself righteous self. &gt;&gt; BEHAVE YOUR HOLIER THAN THOU SELF. &gt;&gt; BEHAVE YOUR PHARISEE SELF. &gt;&gt; [cheering] &gt;&gt; GO SAY AMEN. I'm still coming. &gt;&gt; I ain't done yet. I'm still coming. I still coming. I still coming. I STILL ON MY WAY. I'M COMING. I COMING. I COMING. I'M COMING. GOD WANT YOU STRIPPED. &gt;&gt; God want YOU ON THE CROSS. GOD WANT YOU HUMBLED. [cheering] [applause] HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; GLORY. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; Out of death comes life. &gt;&gt; Out of the death of Christ come the resurrection of life. &gt;&gt; And the only way you can tonight become alive of faith in God is die out to yourself and symptoms and everything around you and become alive. Die out. Die out to your symptoms. Die out to your circumstances. Die out with everything else and become alive in Christ. &gt;&gt; Sometime I was preaching about Isaac. on Isaac planting in the time of famine. &gt;&gt; That just boggles my mind. &gt;&gt; Rain falling. You know &gt;&gt; and that man dig up the ground and putting seeds out there. &gt;&gt; Anybody looking at him say you a mad man. &gt;&gt; We in dry season. &gt;&gt; Famine &gt;&gt; and he's still planting. &gt;&gt; But you know what Isaac had? &gt;&gt; Faith. &gt;&gt; Faith doesn't make you look at the weather. &gt;&gt; Faith doesn't make you look at God &gt;&gt; because God controlled that. Amen. &gt;&gt; You see, we have a responsibility, as I said on Friday, to till the ground. &gt;&gt; We have a responsibility to put the seed. &gt;&gt; And only God could send rain. &gt;&gt; Man don't control rain. &gt;&gt; God does. &gt;&gt; That's why he said, "Your figures shall bring forth his fruit, and I will restore, and I will send you rain in the first month, EVEN THE FORMER RAIN AND THE LATTER RAIN. And it shall COME TO PASS AFTERWARDS, I WILL POUR out my spirit UPON ALL FLESH [screaming] AND YOUR SON. LET THEM LAUGH. THE RAIN IS THE SEED IS IN THE BAND. LET THEM LAUGH. THE SEED IS INSIDE OF YOU, BUT the rain is fixing to fall. WHEN THAT RAIN FALL, LIFE WILL COME FORTH. HALLELUJAH. JESUS ALREADY PROPHESIED, "OUT OF YOUR BELLY SHALL RIVERS OF LIVING WATER, THE SPY OF THE SPIRIT." OH, GIVE THE LORD A SHOUTING OUT. WE NOT CRAZY HERE. AMEN. &gt;&gt; THIS IS THE TRUTH. &gt;&gt; THIS IS THE WORD. [applause and cheering] [applause] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; What a shame. Thank you for that question. &gt;&gt; Is it some people waiting for pressure? You know there some people like that. I not accusing anybody here. &gt;&gt; There are some people like to um study the day before the exams. Do you know who I talking about? I I know who I talking about. I know I know specific people all the time during the months they are studying see close to exam time final week and and they're so gifted. You know the things the study has come it's amazing that the gifted the blessed lucky and so right I'm not talking about that but you don't have to wait for circumstances &gt;&gt; to act. So I will take the approach of intentional. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The word intentional means done on purpose. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; Deliberate. &gt;&gt; Like some people I wouldn't say they intentionally do wicked &gt;&gt; but they do things and they doing like if they intend to do it you didn't intend to do it. &gt;&gt; Plotting and planning and thing. I mean I not in that area. I can't live on plan. I just had to live. &gt;&gt; But intentional means done on purpose. &gt;&gt; Being intentional means making deliberate choices. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; To reflect what is most important to us. &gt;&gt; Becoming intentional can help us maintain a positive mindset, reach goals, experience more clarity. It can also increase our focus and commitment and bring more purpose and meaning to our lives. &gt;&gt; That's the problem today. People are not focused. They're mind everywhere. They're not intentional. Something intentional was done on purpose. If a crime was intentional, it was no accident. &gt;&gt; Remember, brother, if you follow Christ, you'll be hated by people. &gt;&gt; Amen. For all that live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If you come to Christ, you will not come by any church or denomination or creed. You'll come by the blood. That's the only avenue. &gt;&gt; You cannot bring no one with you. You will come alone and stand on your own confession &gt;&gt; and your own faith. &gt;&gt; You have to confess with your mouth. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Jesus Christ. You have to confess with your mouth your deliverance and your breakthrough and your healing and your blessing and restoration. You come as an individual when you come to God. And many times we make those foolish choices. Let me continue. What if Lot when he seen everything easy, he saw where there was money and much popularity. We know the story. God called Abraham. Abraham, Abraham bring along family and the blessing fall on Abraham family too. Family prospering or whatn not then fight among the herdsmen. Abraham the bigger brother come and tell let's not fight. Let's let's say family we don't need that. &gt;&gt; Let us let us take take apart. You go to the east, I go to the west. You you choose. &gt;&gt; God called Abraham and Abraham tell you choose. &gt;&gt; Abraham look the eyes. You look and see all the what? So what? Sodom. You look and see all the wells. You see desert. So you see what your eyes see now. &gt;&gt; He see in desert. So he see water and well towards Sodom. So he start going down this way. Abraham say fine. But Brown, he he because he was a smart man. Watch. I've got faith in God. I just go down into Sodom. I'll make some extra money. I become a great man. Make a wonderful preacher. But you have a choice to make. &gt;&gt; The ley have a choice to make. &gt;&gt; But Abraham, Lot didn't see his family breaking up. &gt;&gt; Lot couldn't see his wife turning the pillar of salt. Lot couldn't see the secondary consequences of a decision to go to what sort of &gt;&gt; so many times our decisions and our choices have consequences that are farreaching. &gt;&gt; That's why I say ask God to lead you in your choices and decisions. Sometime the choices make it look hard &gt;&gt; but you make the right choice. &gt;&gt; It's the harder way. &gt;&gt; It's a narrow way. Sometime people mock that way and they quarrel and they try to put seeds but you stand with your choice &gt;&gt; when God lead you the way God leading you. [cheering] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Tell my son brother Isaac say listen I recognize do you're damned. Don't you damned. I either do or don't. I do as I feel led. &gt;&gt; Because you can't please everybody. &gt;&gt; Everybody looking to be pleased. I cannot please everybody. So I please no one. I pleasing God. &gt;&gt; As long as God is happy, I am happy. Who vex loss? As you say, who vex loss? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [screaming] &gt;&gt; Anytime you're catering for others, your life will be manipulated. &gt;&gt; When you cater for others opinion and ideas, your life could be controlled. &gt;&gt; But when you hold steady with what God has revealed to you, you can stand as a rock. I shall not be moved. &gt;&gt; HOW DAVID SAID IT. DON'T 10,000 FALL MY RIGHT SIDE. I shall not be moved. &gt;&gt; Look what David say. And you come in here and get a fight with this one, a fight with that one. A fight. Gulak live inside of here. &gt;&gt; You see a giant inside of here. &gt;&gt; Please don't leave without telling me and show me that giant. You know, don't come here and get fight. You know, get all your fights home and you come come and rejoice. &gt;&gt; You fight with the deacon, you fight with the usher, you fight with the preacher, you fight with the elder, you fight with everybody that people like that, you know, they come come to fight. They not come for harmony. They come not come for fellowship. They come for faults. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; And if you want to live a false, come to me. &gt;&gt; I could show you. I will help you. I will show you all the faults. &gt;&gt; I know them, you know. Yeah, I will help you. Come and see mine and all too. Yeah, I will help you. I will escort you. Then he escort you straight out. That's why I can't understand people criticizing this preacher, criticize him, criticize him, criticize him. Now what they doing? They're criticizing the preachers all around. So the people will tell that man, he everybody else falls. be right. Everybody else wrong. He's right &gt;&gt; because the people that's what cut in the mind this one off that one off that one off that one off that one. If Christ was doing like that when he say Peter so he could deny me. &gt;&gt; If Jesus was in the same vein of how we think he touch Peter you know I see behold he will deny me. I am one man. I want brother Timothy inside. I ain't going to use PAUL BECAUSE YOU FIGHT THE CHURCH. &gt;&gt; God said my thoughts are not YOUR THOUGHTS. &gt;&gt; MY WAYS are not your ways. &gt;&gt; People who you think not going to make it, they're going to make it. &gt;&gt; People you think wouldn't come, they're going to come. People you think God won't deliver, God will deliver. I LOOK HOW HARD IT IS. DON'T LOOK AT THAT. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Thank you for amen to that. You're not see me. Amen to the word. &gt;&gt; The lady has a choice to make. I going to sit in church and everybody in tongues thinks is the best church and mayor of the city belongs to this church. But you still have to judge that church and its people by the scriptures. Notice this. Abraham the only thing he could do was to take a second choice. Ah, sometimes the second choice is better than the first. &gt;&gt; I get two amens on that. &gt;&gt; Abraham could have check first choice or you know Justin. I could see one man just right now to get the front of the picture cuz he figure easy. I wouldn't I wouldn't go there. I wouldn't call his name among among world leaders and so Abraham can say listen God called me you know I am the man that God has called Lot. Go behave yourself. &gt;&gt; Go in that corner there. &gt;&gt; And Abraham straightened Lot and put Lot in his place. &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? &gt;&gt; But what did Abraham do? Lot you choose. &gt;&gt; Give Lot first choice. &gt;&gt; Give Abraham second choice. &gt;&gt; And Abraham take second choice. And second choice are better than first choice. &gt;&gt; So sometimes stop complaining. I was the first choice. I was the first choice. Cut that crap out. I just read for you. Second choice is better than first choice because second choice put you in God's plan in God's program. Lot got MESSED UP. HIS FAMILY GOT MESSED UP. HIS WIFE TURNED TO PILLAR SWORD. STOP COMPLAINING. God saving you from yourself. Oh give THE LORD A SHOUT IN THE HOUSE. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. [screaming] &gt;&gt; GLORY. It only notice it wasn't long. Lot seen a big city. He didn't see his wife turn the pillar of salt. Though he didn't see the fire burning of the city. But Abraham took the way of the lost his wife few. He stayed in the desert. So being intentional is living purposefully, deliberately, and in alignment with God's word and will. &gt;&gt; You get up in the morning, you're not doing today. God, what are you doing? You know, poke a poke. You're nothing. You are nothing. You can't wake up in the morning and start to figure out what you're going to do. Your planning should be the night before. &gt;&gt; I want to hear more amens than that. Your planning for your tomorrow day is supposed to be the day before. &gt;&gt; You can't wake up on some Sunday morning to plan to go to church. &gt;&gt; Six. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When you're living intentional, you have to write down things &gt;&gt; because your peanut brains are going to remember everything. &gt;&gt; I don't put nothing up there. Don't think it's a joking because I had something to get Isaac this morning. I put that inside my phone. &gt;&gt; He give me an alarm because in my bag &gt;&gt; and if I come with it in my bag and I don't give it to him, I'll forget. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But when it pop up so I put it at alarm for 10:00 &gt;&gt; pop up. &gt;&gt; Soon as he come in the office that this for you. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That done you know. &gt;&gt; My brain had too much thing to deal with. &gt;&gt; That's true. So I have this Google for &gt;&gt; I just upload everything on that &gt;&gt; so my brain's clear to get fresh inspiration. &gt;&gt; I don't want my brain having a hole. I had to go to the bank. I had to go here. I had to visit once here. No, my brain I I don't my brain have all them things. &gt;&gt; Some of you know what that is for. But I help you this morning. &gt;&gt; Offload. I remember the church was about six seven people and boy was pressure thunder good &gt;&gt; I said Lord Jesus I wouldn't say was terrorism but it was quite a character up there and one day I said Lord Jesus I put them into your hands &gt;&gt; I offload them &gt;&gt; and after that never pick them up again &gt;&gt; pray for them &gt;&gt; so being intentional is living purposefully, &gt;&gt; deliberately, &gt;&gt; in alignment with God's word and his will. The opposite is living by reacting, acting by impulse, acting by feelings, emotions, drifting on the sea of life or just reacting. The Bible said lazy man, he said there's a land in the street. &gt;&gt; That's why he not going out. &gt;&gt; He pull the sheet over and take a next leap. Okay. So this is to live on purpose not by chance but by forethought. This [snorts] is you choosing to obey. This is you choosing obedience on purpose &gt;&gt; not by chance. &gt;&gt; Choice is a great thing. In many things of life we have a give a choice. The way of life itself is a choice. We have a right to make our own way. Choose our own way that we want to live. Education is a choice. We can choose whether we going to be educated or whether we are not going to be educated. That's a choice. Right and wrong is a choice. Every man, every woman, boy or girl has to choose whether they are going to try to live right or not live right. It's a choice. Choice is a great thing. And your eternal destination is a choice. And maybe tonight some of you might make that choice where you will spend eternity before this service might end tonight. There'll be one time if you turn God down many times. There'll be one time you will turn him down the last time. This is the line between mercy and judgment. It's a dangerous thing for a man or woman, boy or girl to step across that line. There's no return. There's another choice we have in life. The life, a life companion. A young man, a young woman stepping out on life has been given a right to make a choice. The young man chooses. The young woman has a right to accept or reject. It's still a choice on both sides. Both man and woman, they have a right to choose. And you have a choice as a Christian. You have a choice of the church. Choose any church you want to belong to. That's your choice. There's nobody can tell you or make you come to a certain church. That is our freedom. Every man can choose for himself. Freedom of religion is a great thing. Then he said, "God, help us to keep it as long as we can." So when you choose this church, you can choose whether you are in this church, whether you will choose a church that will guide you to eternal destination. You can choose a church that has a certain creed that you might think that creed is just what you want or the other church has their creed and then there's the word of God. You have a choice. You have to make that choice. There's some people love the church. There's some people love the word. &gt;&gt; The church people love the church. They love the pastor. They love everything and whatnot. They in church. They are the same as Catholics &gt;&gt; in the message. THEY ARE SAME AS BAPTIST in the message. The Catholic churches they go they go and play the cannival. They come and get the ashes and they get normal normal. They going to church, they're not missing mass &gt;&gt; and you're missing mass. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The people come, they smoke up the place and whatnot. They do all little similit and they smoke on the place and they sing like little him and man do little things cross thing like that. People feel religious. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; AND THERE THOUSANDS GO TO every single Sunday. &gt;&gt; I know I was part of it. I was acolyte you know. &gt;&gt; All right. So you watching a here exacolyte I come out and become I come out to walk in the light. &gt;&gt; Keep the light. &gt;&gt; Okay. Here we are. &gt;&gt; So watch. I believe it was Elijah one time at Mont Caramel with the showdown. But there will come a time when you will have to make a choice. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And you men here, he said the hour going to come or you going to make a choice. You're going to either go into go this world council or you're going to go into the denominational or you're you're not going to be a denomination anymore. You're going to have to do that. That choice is coming soon. &gt;&gt; It's a dangerous time to wait till the last hour because you might take on something that you could never shake out of it. And you talk about the Jubilee. When the Jubilee comes and the priest roing to go free and people don't want to hear and go free, they had their ears bored and they could hear it and they can't go free anymore. Elijah said, "Choose you this day whom you shall serve. If God be God, serve him. If Bal be God, serve him." So I think I want to conclude here. So listen, Jordan crossing Jordan dead has to be intentional. &gt;&gt; When they was trying to press Jesus one time, she said, "My hours yet come." In other words, you can't touch me. They can't hold me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When his hour come, he said, "My hour is now come." &gt;&gt; Jesus whole temple changed &gt;&gt; because how he know he's setting out towards Calvary. &gt;&gt; So the first part of his ministry, cast no devils, healing the sick, multiplying the bread and fish and so on, healing the people and so on, blessing them and so on. He knew he was on a mission. &gt;&gt; He knew this path was temporary. He knew he's coming to a purpose. He told his disciples privately, if I don't go, the comforter will not come. I will not give you comfortless. I have to go. &gt;&gt; But I send him back something. I have to go for it to come. &gt;&gt; Don't try to hold me back. [laughter] I have to go for it to come. If I don't go, it will not come. If I don't go, it will not come. You have to wait for it to come. &gt;&gt; Oh, give the Lord some praises. &gt;&gt; So, when he rose FROM THE DEAD, HE [laughter] START TO TALK TO THEM AND TELL THEM, "BEHOLD, I send the promise of my father upon you. Carry in the seat of Jerusalem until you get power from on high." They need power to deal with them devils. They need power to deal with their children. You need power to be WITH THAT HUSBAND, WITH THAT WIFE, OH WITH THAT FAMILY, WITH THAT BOSS. YOU NEED POWER TO DEAL WITH THEM SEX SPIRITS AND ALL THEM DEMONS AROUND THERE. YOU NEED POWER IN YOUR LIFE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; OH, GIVE THE LORD SOME PRAISES. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; WHEN YOU COME TO CHURCH, BE EMPOWERED. [cheering and applause] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; Let's go. All right. John 12 20-2 24 scripture and there were certain Greeks among them that came to worship at the feast the same came therefore to Philillip which is a basa of Galilee and desired him saying sir we worship Jesus Philip come as telling Andrew again Andrew and Philip tell Jesus and Jesus answered them saying the hour is come that the son of man shall be glorified &gt;&gt; verily I verily I say unto You except a corner we fall into the ground and die. It abideth alone. But if it die, it bringeth forth much fruit. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So these people come to see Jesus. I want to see him. Why? They heard about him. So the hearing part wasn't the issue. Faith come by hearing, hearing the word. The issue wasn't what they heard. They didn't come to hear about him or hear him. They wanted to see him or meet him. They came to the disciple and unlike these modern disciples now taking um let me tell you about it but we not what they did. He said these disciples representing the true five ministry bring the seeker to Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All right let's go. He said except a corner we fall into the ground and die alone. If you want to bring forth fruit, here we go. Die to yourself and your own man-made theology and be born again of the spirit and the resurrection. That's right. Get rid of that old spirit of selfishness and dryness that is in you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Take on new life. &gt;&gt; There are too many people just coming to church hearing and going back home. &gt;&gt; They're not even examining what they are hearing &gt;&gt; as a applied to themselves. Amen. &gt;&gt; When you hear this here old spirit of selfishness, &gt;&gt; you have to examine yourself. &gt;&gt; You have an antisocial spirit. &gt;&gt; Got to examine yourself. &gt;&gt; You can't mix. You can't. So, what happened to heaven? Heaven, you get plenty trouble. You know, you you not corner by seven heaven. You ain't mixing. Stay down here with that. That can't make heaven. You follow what I'm saying? &gt;&gt; So we have to come out of us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You have to come out of your Trinidad thing. &gt;&gt; Some people love the train thing in the I want to get on that this morning. There's a whole sermon by itself. That that terrible trainer. A terrible spirit trainer. Say God is not a Trinidadian. Don't don't fool yourself right now. &gt;&gt; One man say train that bride had to be perfected by train flesh. Oh yeah. &gt;&gt; That come from the bottomless pit of hell. That the kind of demon doctrines of devils that was pedling in this message. Train that bride has been fed by train flesh. Flesh flesh. &gt;&gt; You're crazy. &gt;&gt; All right. Unless a grain of corn falls into the ground and rots, unless a man rots to his own t uh theology. Listen to this now. So they heard that God was using used this miracle working Hebrew God in the land. This is Greeks. So it attracted the attention to come to see Jesus. And notice usually the way that people want to find Jesus is to find somebody who knows how to take them to him. And if he ever chooses a servant, he always chooses somebody that will bring the people to him. &gt;&gt; We find that here we go. &gt;&gt; They brought they were brought into his presence. &gt;&gt; How much years of human preaching that this is what the people need to get into. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Not into theology. Not into mystery and all kind of revelations but to come into presence. &gt;&gt; The fight is to get you into presence. In the Old Testament was dead to go in. Now it's dead to be outside his presence. &gt;&gt; The churches are struck by the kangly with spiritual debt. That why they said dead in church this morning. And the excuses the preaching mysteries and the preaching histories and revelation. 4 hours burning out the people praying weary after that jars of biscuit. No worship, no atmosphere, no moisture. And the prophet taught us it will take the water. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Your water, the water is the praises. &gt;&gt; When you worship, you create an atmosphere on the seed that you're receiving. [applause] &gt;&gt; If you keep quiet, you fall in the amorphous, you know, you just fall asleep just cold, cool, cool. And an angel, some angel will come and find some air condition breeze right over you there. and your top lip get sealed up there and in your head just n day &gt;&gt; I know where they go subconscious and you're dead as a don inside the church go and put a toothpick and open your eye go and wash your face and come back up or something but start to give God praise and create atmosphere you wouldn't do that in football you wouldn't do that for cricket you wouldn't do that in your house and you're watching cricket you would be dead oh god goal or cricket or ball I don't know football or whatnot or cricket or score or you know wicket wicket wicket World Cup is just your head. &gt;&gt; People looking to have World Cup. You long say that. &gt;&gt; Thousands of people they paint their face, they paint the color, the the the color of the flag and whatnot. They in the spirit, they're in the atmosphere of it. &gt;&gt; When you come to service, you have to come to see your goal. You got to come TO SEE JESUS SCORE. YOU HAVE TO COME TO SEE MIRACLES AND SIGNS AND WONDERS. YOU HAVE TO COME OUT OF THE EXPECTATION. You have to come out the excitement. The hand all them st and make a look at OUR OLD NOISE. THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY WORSHIPING. BUT WE KNOW WHAT WE WORSHIP. WE KNOW WHO WE WORSHIP. WE KNOW WHY WE WORSHIP. OH, GIVE THE LORD SOME PRAISES. LET JESUS CALL A GOAL THIS MORNING. [cheering and applause] HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. YOU COME HERE BUT YOU DO DON'T HAVE TO PAY NO PLANE TICKET. &gt;&gt; You had to go and get no visa to go to America cuz you know problems with the visa thing already &gt;&gt; right here. &gt;&gt; You can get IN THE ATMOSPHERE &gt;&gt; RIGHT HERE. &gt;&gt; DON'T KNOW WHAT THE PREACHER HAVE TO DO with you &gt;&gt; the woman WITH THE BLOOD ISSUE WASN'T BOTHERED BY ALL THOSE BIG HULKING MEN STANDING THERE WITH NO FAITH WHATSOEVER. SHE WASN'T BOTHERED BY HER SISTERS WHO COME INTO GOSSIP AND MOCK AND WHATNOT. SHE WASN'T BOTHERED BY THE CROWD AROUND JESUS. SHE WAS CONCERNED THAT THE BLOOD ISSUE NEED TO BE STOPPED. SHE WAS CONCERNED THAT SHE NEEDED A HEALING. SHE WAS CONCERNED SHE NEEDED A BREAKTHROUGH AND NOTHING WAS GOING TO STOP HER THIS MORNING. OH, give the Lord some praises. WHEN YOU GET THAT FOCUS, WHEN YOU GOT THE DETERMINATION, WHEN YOU GOT THAT INTENTION, SHE WAS INTENTIONAL. OH, GLORY. LOOK GOOD. SHE SAID, "IF I COULD TOUCH THE HEM OF HIS GARMENT, I'LL BE [screaming] MADE WHOLE." GIVE THE LORD SOME PRAISES. THAT WOMAN WAS INTENTIONAL. &gt;&gt; [cheering] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; She wasn't going by her feelings. &gt;&gt; She told herself something. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And when she come the crowd around Jesus. Now, if she was in the feelings, she say, "Well, I'll come back tomorrow." You know, my less unbeliefless people tomorrow wasn't coming. She said, "Today is the day." &gt;&gt; When she left the house, she said, "Today is the day. &gt;&gt; I want you to leave your house like that. &gt;&gt; I want you to come to church like that. STOP COMING TO CHURCH. STAY HOME. IF YOU DON'T HAVE EXPECTATION, STAY HOME. WE DON'T BEGGING YOU TO BE IN YOUR CHURCH. NOW, YOU COME HERE BY YOUR CHOICE. YOU COME HERE BECAUSE YOU WANT SOMETHING FROM GOD. YOU COME HERE TO TEACH THE PASTOR. YOU COME HERE TO EXPLAIN NOTHING TO THE PASTOR. YOU COME HERE TO SHOW THE PASTOR NOTHING. [applause] YOU COME HERE BECAUSE YOU NEED HELP. YOU COME HERE BECAUSE YOU NEED A BREAKTHROUGH. YOU COME HERE BECAUSE YOU NEED DELIVERANCE. [cheering and applause] OH, give the Lord SOME PRAISES. &gt;&gt; [applause and cheering] &gt;&gt; I WAS expecting a better sermon than that this morning. You know, go with expectation. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I'm not here to fulfill your expectation. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So they brought them into Jesus presence. &gt;&gt; Not the vials, wolves, trumpets, and when a man finish. That's why Paul said, "I come to you not with enticing words &gt;&gt; because I don't want your faith rest on me. &gt;&gt; I want your faith rest on the power of God. &gt;&gt; So I come to bring that impress my my my my explanation and revelation when you feel so but I see I have been in meetings where people just shake their no when they say shake their head not because they believe or not not because they revelation you know it's because unbelief taking them. They don't even know what the man saying. &gt;&gt; I see men I don't think they're conscious of it. is scratching their heads though. &gt;&gt; Cuz do you understand what going on? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Don't feel confused. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And God is a God of clarity. &gt;&gt; If you ain't get nothing else, get this. &gt;&gt; God wants to get it to you clear. When you have clarity as a business person, as an individual, as a teacher, lawyer with clarity, it's clear before you. &gt;&gt; You could effectively execute. What a point. If a mechanic doing SOMETHING AND HE CAN'T GET THROUGH, he don't know what going on here and he get something and he unfold and what what it's clear &gt;&gt; break this not break this not do this put this here put this here it's over &gt;&gt; because you get clarity what did Habac say WRITE THE VISION &gt;&gt; MAKE IT PLAIN &gt;&gt; THAT YOU WILL REACH AND RUN NOT MAKE IT COMPLEX OR GIVE THE LORD A SHOUT MAKE IT PLAIN GOD LOVES CLARITY Tallel &gt;&gt; vision brings clarity. &gt;&gt; That why Jesus operate by vision. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That why Bible say without a vision you perish. &gt;&gt; Vision means you see it before it happens. &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord. &gt;&gt; This church is built by vision. &gt;&gt; What you see here was vision &gt;&gt; materialized. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I ask you on Friday to say and repeat after me, make me a revival. &gt;&gt; Let the revival be in me. &gt;&gt; You want revival for the church. You know you, you &gt;&gt; individual. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You're poor father, POOR MOTHER, POOR HUSBAND, poor wife. But make me a revival. &gt;&gt; It will change your whole atmosphere around you. &gt;&gt; [applause and cheering] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; They were brought into the presence of Bam. Just as soon as these Greeks was pointed to Jesus, Jesus did not point to himself. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; So why all these ministers pointing to the church? &gt;&gt; Jesus never say, "Aha, all you want to see me. Here am I. I am. You know who I'm Jesus. Oh, I'm so glad to meet you. God bless you. No, Jesus didn't do that. Listen to this. He did not make himself known to them because you cannot know Jesus in that way. &gt;&gt; Jesus is known in that way. But we see here in the scripture when the Greeks was brought up to Jesus, here we go. And was in his presence, &gt;&gt; we're not talking about brought up to books and tapes &gt;&gt; and I believe the message. We're not talking about that. &gt;&gt; We're talking about beyond the word. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We talking about presence. &gt;&gt; See what we fighting for? &gt;&gt; That's why I say praise God. Worship God &gt;&gt; because normally and naturally you're not into that. &gt;&gt; You in your flesh. You're in yourself. &gt;&gt; You're in your human. &gt;&gt; But to praise God is to defy gravity. To lift your hand. That say praise him. Praise him in the good time. Praise him in the bad time. Hallelujah. Praising is not about you. It's about who he is. Worship is not about you. is about who God is. He's the object of worship. Hallelujah. Whether things working out or not, you're still worshiping. Then the God could say, "Look at them. They're worshiping me regardless. THEY CUT THE PAY, THEY WORSHIP. THEY LOST THEIR JOB. THEY WORSHIP. THE TASK GET TWO FLAT TIRES AND THEY'RE STILL WORSHIPING. I have to bless that person. I have to back that PERSON UP. LET THE ANGELS GO FORWARD." OH, GLORY TO GOD. HALLELUJAH. YOU THINK THAT'S FARFETCHED? Let me tell you something. No, the the two were brought brothers, Bished. &gt;&gt; God didn't tell them and whis in their ears. They accustom praying, busting the door open. They wasn't backslitting as us. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Catch them. &gt;&gt; There's three times that they pray. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I wouldn't ask how much time you pray &gt;&gt; and show I raise of hands. I wouldn't ask that. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Three times a day &gt;&gt; and they make a commandment because them jealous them fellas and them them fell so blessed they want to out the light &gt;&gt; and when fellas hear the commandment them bust the door open &gt;&gt; let them hear him pray &gt;&gt; pray normal &gt;&gt; when they say we go send in the fire &gt;&gt; they say no problem &gt;&gt; they answer you know &gt;&gt; now if you're not in the faith think about it give me back a call this evening at 4:00 not them fell you know &gt;&gt; no call 4:00 you know he said we want to let You know, &gt;&gt; we don't go bow. &gt;&gt; We're not bowing down. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Take us one time. We're not bowing down. &gt;&gt; Our God is God. He is able to deliver TO BOW DOWN. OUR ABLE GOD IS ABLE TO DELIVER US. AND IF WE DON'T DELIVER US, WE ARE NOT GOING TO BACK UP. OUR GOD IS ABLE TO SEND DYNAMICS. OUR GOD IS ABLE TO SEND ON FIRE. OUR IS GOING TO SEND NO MIRACLES. WE ARE NOT GOING TO BACK DOWN. WE ARE NOT GOING TO GIVE UP. LISTEN, [cheering] you may be seated. It was so impressive. God has telling me to hold back, hold back, hold back. I go NUMB MYSELF. HALLELUJAH. I go numb myself. And when THEY PUSH THEM FELLAS IN THE FIRE, THEIR BANDS WERE LOOSE AND THEY SAW A FOURTH MAN. THEY THREW THREE MEN IN THE FIRE. THEY SAW A FOURTH MAN IN [screaming] THE FIRE. OH, HE SAID IT LOOK LIKE THE SON OF GOD. WHEN DEVIL WANT TO PUSH YOU IN HIS FIRE, [screaming] GOD GOING TO STEP INTO YOUR FIRE. GOD GOING TO STEP INTO YOUR TRIAL. GOD GOING TO STEP INTO YOUR CONDITION. COME ON SAINTS, HAVE FAITH IN GOD. [cheering] [cheering] [applause] You may be seated. &gt;&gt; I believe the angels are looking in. I believe angels looking into this service this morning. &gt;&gt; I believe the pillar of fire is here. &gt;&gt; I believe God give us the UNCCTION TO FUNCTION. HALLELUJAH. I BELIEVE GOD GIVEN US THE UNCCTION TO SPEAK. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. I BELIEVE THAT GOD GIVEN US WHAT TO SAY. [cheering] &gt;&gt; [crying] &gt;&gt; as soon as they were brought into his presence. That's the main thing. &gt;&gt; Get the people in his presence. &gt;&gt; I told his ministers in M right here in that I said I don't want to hear all the revelations. I want to hear what the prophet say. &gt;&gt; I want to hear no private revelation. God sent a prophet for me to bring no private revelation. God bring me God sent me to do that. I dream last night and dream last night and that certain things I don't touch. &gt;&gt; I touching the star, the moon, the comet and I don't touch them things at all. &gt;&gt; They have enough external sign to fight up with. I want to know what's supposed to be inside of here. &gt;&gt; I want to know what is the bright sign. &gt;&gt; It have people food is on astrology and diet of of stars and Venus and Mars and and where this blue blood moon and all kind of thing. I had nothing on blood moon stars and what my calling. Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, Rome doing what? Putin doing what? All I'm doing thing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Why you want to do my thing? &gt;&gt; The thing that God want me to do. &gt;&gt; Put do anything. I got Trump doing anything. Anyway, &gt;&gt; that's Trump say and back down. He could do that. &gt;&gt; We can't do that. &gt;&gt; God can't do that. When God say his thing, he don't back down on it. HE SAID, "MY WORD SHALL NOT RETURN IN the void." God don't BACK DOWN WHEN HE said his thing. He says seven time revival. He can't BACK DOWN ON THAT. HEY, GLORY TO GOD. I DON'T CARE WHO DON'T WANT TO SAY IT. I'M SAYING IT BECAUSE YOU CAN FIND WHERE IT'S WRITTEN. THEY CAN FIND WHERE IT'S SPOKEN. SEVEN TUNNELS IS THE BRIDE REVIVAL. THAT IS THE FREE CHURCH. THE CHURCH HAVE NO REVIVAL TO GET. BUT THE BRIDE, OH GIVE THE [screaming] LORD A SHOUT. THOSE SEVEN VICES WILL BE MADE KNOWN TO THE TRUE CHURCH. &gt;&gt; [cheering] [applause] &gt;&gt; GLORY. GLORY. [cheering] HALLELUJAH. WHERE THERE IS GOD, THERE IS NOISE. NO NOISE. NO GOD. WHEREVER JESUS IS. HOSANA. HOSANA. HOSANA. Give the LORD SOME PRAISES. I AM NOT ASHAMED OF THE SON OF MAN NOR HIS WORDS. I AM NOT ASHAMED OF THIS MESSAGE. I AM NOT ASHAMED OF THIS GOSPEL. [cheering] That's the main thing. What's the main thing? Get the people in his presence. As soon as in his presence Jesus said, "Except a corner of wheat falls into the ground and die, it's abide alone." &gt;&gt; What an unusual thing. Instead of accepting the introduction, the thing he done was pointing them to the place where they could find him. &gt;&gt; He pointed them to that great truth. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; How to see him. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; They could not see him in that eternal life &gt;&gt; standing there the way he was. He was a man. But he pointed them in his presence. Christ. Oh, [groaning] I now get it. Because the people not coming into presence, they're not seeing the Calvary &gt;&gt; where they're supposed to go and die out &gt;&gt; to see Jesus. &gt;&gt; So then they fall in love with the church. &gt;&gt; They fall in love with the doctrine of the church, the creed. &gt;&gt; That's decreed. You know, &gt;&gt; Catholic church have decreed &gt;&gt; that message with the creed. &gt;&gt; You see? So hear us now. He pointed them there in his presence. Christ pointed them to the truth. He said how to see him was to go to the cross &gt;&gt; except a corner wheat falls. It abides alone. And if he did not die, listen with Christ now. If he did not die, &gt;&gt; he would have to abide alone himself. &gt;&gt; If he did not die, but him being the corner wheat that fell into the ground, then if it falls into the ground, it would bring forth an abundance. If it falls into the ground and die, first it has to be a gumatized grain. &gt;&gt; That means have to be a grain with the spirit baptism in it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; To be a corner wheat. &gt;&gt; So first you have to identify what this corner wheat is. &gt;&gt; He said first it must be a gemized grain or it won't bring forth nothing. But he had to give his own life in order to
