switch over god bless you saints and greetings in the precious name of jesus and it's always a privilege that we could come in god's house we have the liberty to serve christ liberty to worship we still have that freedom of religion it will always be that way but this is what we have for now so this morning i have a few comments uh just before we get into the word and i just want to read something that uh was on the news and i feel that it will edify you and help you tallahassee hospital staff she had breaking stories of talking dead covet patience the situation is so heartbreaking right now that many of those doctors many of those nurses are referring to some of these patients that are sick of the sick as the quote are talking dead i ask why and the answer is also really heartbreaking here that's because that refers to some of those patients whose lungs are so heavily damaged by this virus that they can no longer breathe on their own and here's the thing those are patients who are still awake right now who are still conscious so they are having these very difficult conversations with their doctors and their nurses and facing that very tough reality that if that life-sustaining equipment that's breeding for them is removed as this hospital official describe it for me they could be dead in a matter of minutes and that really does speak to the heartbreak of what's happening in many of these hospitals throughout the sunshine state another one children under 12 get in covet 19 at an alarming rate that's another piece of news one more washington post this was wednesday 18th august a mom who died of covet days after a husband makes one final wish make sure my kids get vaccinated a few weeks ago lydia rodriguez thought her body was strong enough to fight the coroner virus without the vaccine but after a week-long church camp she and other members of her family tested positive for the colonel virus by the time rogers 42 changed her mind and asked for the shot it was too late a doctor said a doctor said a ventilator awaited her her cousin dotty told the washington post out of options the garvin sun texas mother of four asks her family to make a promise please make sure my kids get vaccinated rodriguez a piano teacher told her sister during her last phone call rodriguez died monday two weeks after her husband lawrence rodriguez 49 also died after coronavirus complications the couple fought the virus on hospital beds just a few feet from one another in a texas intensive care unit june said lydia and lawrence rodriguez who were married for 21 years were among the tens of millions of americans who have not yet received at least one dose of the conor irs vaccine which is available free to anyone over the age of 12. health officials have stressed that the vaccine significantly lowers one chance of becoming severely ill or dying of the virus the now orphaned children of the rodriguez family joined the millions tragically affected by the sometimes deadly illness the case of rodriguez family echoes that of other unvaccinated patients who have begged their doctors for vaccine doses before being intubated lydia has never really believed in vaccines jones 55 told the post she believed that she could handle everything on her own and you didn't really need medicine a neonatal nurse jones was familiar with the serious effects of covet 19 had on mothers and baby she treated at the sugarland texas hospital where she worked she shared with rodriguez how she had watched patient after patient be connected to a ventilator for weeks without much improvement jones could have gone on and on but her cousin silence spoke for itself i knew she would never get vaccinated jones told the post i was very concerned rodriguez husband who shared her anti-vaccine beliefs also declined to get the shot three of their four children are eligible i have not yet received a vaccine in early july after rodriguez and the children returned from a christian church camp jones's worst fears became true one by one each member of the family including rodriguez's husband who did not attend camp because of work tested positive for the kona virus the family didn't tell anyone that they were sick until rodriguez husband drove her to the hospital on july 12th after she began experiencing shortness of breath rodriguez was admitted to the icu and her husband was admitted to another ward jones said by then the rest of the family stepped in bringing groceries and medicine to the couple's four children who were all infected and quarantined at home the youngest child the youngest child and by then the rest of the family stepped in as to bring groceries and messenger to the couple's four children who were all infected and quarantined at home the youngest child was the only one to experience mild symptoms jones said the rest were asymptomatic at one point lawrence rodriguez condition appeared to be improving but a couple of days later he was admitted he was rushed to the icu he requested a coronavirus vaccine shortly before being put on a ventilator jones said it was also too late for him he died august second and by then lydia rodriguez was fully dependent on an oxygen mask that prevented her from talking to her children who called to check in and sing christian hymns to lift her spirits we are praying for you on taking care of the kids jones recounted telling her cousin during the last days hospital staff called family august 16 to report the rodgers had died the family has relayed her last wishes about a vaccine to the couple's 18 year old twins joan said dot the plan is to schedule an appointment for the 11 year old daughter as soon as she qualify and the couple's six-year-old son is expected to get the shot soon and so on i share this with you because i know we have people in this church and i could only talk about districts who are still unvaccinated and strange enough they don't want the government to make it mandated to take it but pastors take it on their own cells to mandate to the congregation don't take the vaccine so they've taken instruction from a message pope or some pope behind the pulpit not to take the vaccine but they don't want to take it but what i want to say this morning is this don't let your liberty affect the lives of others this christian woman she went to camp her husband didn't go to the camp but she brought it from the camp to her house and she affected the home and this is my this is where we come now you have your liberty to be unvaccinated but do you have liberty to kill this one or infect that one it is well known that more people come through the virus than have died so much people have died some people got infected and christian non-christian most people are coming true some people have died yes but i don't want to talk about those that have died i want to talk a little bit about those that are in this condition just call them the talking dead so sick so affected that they're living off this machine i trust that this shakes some of you in your head because to me it is not love it is not care it is plain downright selfishness and indifference and people will get hurt i hope and trust that trinidad could become so what they call it um a herd immunity to protect all of those who are not vaccinated or don't want to be vaccinated that all they could beat all your chest and say oh you'll win fine i have no problem with that i trust that we get her humanity because other than that if what we are seeing in the states and elsewhere with this delta variant and the variants that are coming out it beginning to affect children children beginning to die we talk about four-year-old turning under 12 years old being infected whereas the first wave of the virus didn't interfere with turret didn't touch children but it's so doing so now so i want you to think what your so-called liberty and choice that you have that you could affect your husband your wife your girlfriend your boyfriend your son your daughter you could do that you could break them bring the the virus straight in the house and take out grandma wipe out grandpa take out the family for what purpose i wonder what kind of conscience these pastors gonna have to live with when these things begin to hit churches and hit lives i wonder how they will sleep well telling the people don't take the vaccine if the man's scared and don't want to take the chap that is his business but he has no right dictating to me his revelation of the vaccine he have a right to preach with a god and i'm not here to preach on vaccine i get to make this as comments so i hope they speak to your heart and tell yourself you better think carefully if you want to stay in your own box and stay permanent and don't move that's your choice but it come in you can't say how you can say when all you could say do something about it there is no room not to do anything do something be quite common to you so don't take your liberty to kill somebody don't take your liberty to afflict somebody don't take that that's your freedom and if you don't be unvaccinated fine but be careful that that same freedom affects some others one last comment there was a woman in russia they watched this virus mutate about 40 times and they said the virus was using a body like a gym to improve itself think about it now jehovah praise anybody you want to switch over now we want to get into the words [Music] hallelujah [Music] fight for your name one more time jehovah is your name jehovah hears your name jehovah [Music] he's a mighty warrior crazy [Music] one more time father god we thank you for your word this morning as we go to your word lord may your spirit come lord you said go into all the world and preach the gospel and i believe what we have to share this morning is something from you father and i pray it will speak to the people's heart and they get revelation they get inspiration they get discernment granted lord and jesus may ask it amen and amen god bless you saints and thanks for coming out i've been online uh i think it's the next two weeks we should be back in church by the grace of god and that's that's wonderful scripture this morning first samuel 17 wanna read 28-51 joshua 1 1-3 and second kings 2 1-6 samuel 17 28-51 this is david coming to drop victory pictures some some of the stuff from his father to his brothers to his and eliabe's eldest brotherhood when he speak unto the men and the layups anger was kindle against david he said why came as though his and with whom hast thou left those few sheep in wilderness i know thy pride and the naughtiness of their heart for thou art come down the door might just see the battle and david said what have i no done is there not a cause and he turned from him towards another and speak after the same manner and the people answered him again after the former manner and when the words were heard which they would speak they rehearsed them before saw and he sent for him and david said to saul let no man had failed because of him thy servant will go and fight this philistine and saul said to david thou are not able to go against this philistine to fight with him for the what but a ute and he a man of war from his youth and david said on the soul die save and kept his father's sheep became a land and a beer and took a lamb out of the flock and i went after him and smote him and delivered it out of his mouth and when he arose against me i caught him by his beard and smote him and slew him thy servants through boat the land and the bear and this uncircumcised philistine shall be as one of them seeing he had defined the armies of the living god david said moreover the lord had delivered me out of the poor of the land out of the poor of the beer he would deliver me out of the hand of this philistine and saul said unto david go and the lord be with thee saul armed devil with his armor he put an helmet of brass upon his head and he armed them in a quota mail david greeted his sword upon his armor he has said to go for he had not proved it and david said i cannot go with these i have not proved them and david put them off him he took his staff in his hand chosen five smooth stones out of a brook he put him in shepherd's bag which he had even in a script and his sling was in his hand and he junior to the philistine and the philistine came on and drew near unto david and the man that bear the shield went before him and when the philistine looked about and saw david he disdain him for he was but a youth ready of a fair countenance and the philistines said unto david am i a dog the dog came comes to me with stabs on the philistine cursed david by his gods and the philistines said to david come to me and i will give thy flesh unto the fold of the air unto the beast of the field then said david to the philistines don't commence to me with sword with spear with a shield but i come to dean the name of the lord of hosts the god of the armies of israel whom thou has defied this day will the lord deliver thee into my hand and i will snipe thee and will take thine head from thee i will give the carcasses of the host of the philistines this day unto the falls of the air under the wild beasts of the earth that all the it men know that there is a god in israel and all this assembly shall know that the lord saveth not with sword and spear for the battle is the lord's and he will give you unto our hands and came to pass when the philistines arose and came and drew near to meet david that david hasted and ran towards the army to meet the philistines and david put his hand in his back took dance's stone slang it smoked the philistine in his forehead and the stone sunk in his forehead and he fell upon the face to the earth so david prevailed over the philistine with a sling and a stone and smote the philistine and slew him but there was no sword in the hand of david therefore david ran and stood upon the philistine and took his sword and drew it out of his sheet therefore and slew him and cut off his head there with when the philistines saw the champion was dead they fled like that when the champion was dead they fled and the men of israel and judah arose and shouted and pursued the philistines until that until they'll come to the valley under the gates of ekron and the wounded of the philistines fell down by the way of sharim even unto the gut unto akron and the children of israel okay i'll stop right there praise the lord amen so let's go now to joshua chapter one and we're going to read uh verse one to three now after the death of moses the servant of the lord it came to pass that the lord spake unto joshua the son of nun moses minister saying moses my servant is dead now therefore arise go over this jordan dull and all these people unto the land which i do give them even to the children of israel every place that the soul of your foot shall tread upon that have i given unto you as i said unto moses our last scripture is from first samuel chapter 2 1 to six and it came to pass when the lord would take up elijah into heaven by aware of him that elijah went with elisha from giga and elijah said to elisha tarry here i pray thee for the lord that sent me to better elijah said unto him as the lord liveth as i so live it i will not leave thee so they went down to bethel and the sons of the prophets that were that helped him fought elisha said unto him knowest doubt that the lord will take away thy master from thy head today he said yeah i know it hold your peace elijah said unto him elisha tarry here i praise him for the lord that sent me to jericho he said as the lord live it as i so live it i will not leave thee so they came to jericho and the sons of the prophets that were jericho came to elisha and said unto him know his doubt that the lord will take away thy master from thy head today he answered yeah i know it hold your peace elijah said unto him terry i pray thee here for the lord that sent me to jordan he said as the lord live it as i so live it i will not leave thee and the two went on may god bless this world you may be seated god please bless you and are we so grateful to be here this morning where is brother over going to all these scriptures [Laughter] all right so the title this morning the fifo ministry in types that's the title this morning five-fold ministry in types on a subject david's ministry joshua's ministry elisha's ministry and i have an inspiration the ministry of jesus christ in the adopted sons in the last day of the context scripture acts chapter 4 31 to 33 and it reads and when they had prayed the place was shaking where they were assembled together and they were all filled with the holy ghost and they staked the word of god with boldness and the multitude of them that believe who have one heart and of one soul neither said any of them that ought of the things which he possessed as his own but they all had things in common this is the voice i want to get to and with great power gave the apostles witness of the resurrection of the lord jesus and great grace was upon them all oh blessed be the name of the lord great power is what the bosses have to give witness of the resurrection of jesus christ now let's go buddha bryan let's go back to the real first light the old pentecostal blessing and the power of the holy ghost back in the church they put it all on the preacher today it ain't the preacher here we go the holy ghost is just as much to the laity as it is to the preacher or give the lord a shout feeling good already the holy ghost is what just as much to the laity as it is to the preacher he ain't got all the religion they cut it out here i am one today this is god a manner that believes that we ought to get the spirit of god back in the church where we can have the gifts of the spirit operating with unction and power this is not a brother to your thing this is what a brand i'm saying i want i'm one today that believes we ought to get the spirit of god back in the church where we can have the gifts of the spirit operating with unction and power but today we find men wearing the beginning in the church ages you notice it started at deeds of the nicolaitans after a while it become a doctrine well what is it we have taken all the spirit away from the congregation and make bishops oversteers popes you see where i get message poop from because that's what they make when they take the spirit off from the congregation and put it on men message men pastor men so-called fivefold men not not god fightful as men who assume things now they have taken all the spirit away from the congregation and made bishops overseers popes put it all in the pulpit and the pulpit got intellectual hallelujah no more spirit just talk and more talk mystery on top of mystery just intellectual explanation a reference from who say and who said who said who say oh there i ain't come to preach some time magazine or music magazine that's what them say all day i'm come to preach i'm the word of god because the word is original seed what word not my word the word from the mouth of the prophets oh glory to god amen so watch they put it all in the pulpit and the pulpit got intellectual and there you got a hybrid church again under intellectuals but obama said god sent us back to the holy ghost amongst the people let the unction of the spirit move among the people giving forth messages and power and manifestation if we have to stand on the street corner or get a chicken hole to abandon somewhere oh praise the name of the lord and if jesus christ lived in the apostles and done the signs that he was hearing it it will do it again if we get zeroed in we have got to get zeroed i don't care what the church says that's why i try to say zero on this promise i want to know what has promised the bride i don't want to know what the devil this doing out here and that doing out here i want to know what is my promise because i have to deal with the press with room with with false prophets with false people you have to deal with all of that oh praise the name of the lord if the apostles hit the dot we can hit the dot too could somebody say amen if we will get zeroed with god's word let our experience zero with his word they did it if they did it we can do it too amen oh blessed being of the lord that's so wonderful the subject we talk about david's ministry joshua ministry and elijah ministry the fight for ministry and type now david was virtually an unknown god told samuel david are nobody virtually unknown anointed to be king by samuel under divine instruction and we know we know the story and i wanted to show as this is a type of the fifo ministry because i keep saying it i know a lot of ministers and brothers disagree what i'm saying but i keep seeing it anyhow because it's what i believe and this is what i'm seeing in the word and i'll preach it because i see it and i believe it there's a fiffold ministry yet the reason i'm saying that it will take dynamics to produce the five world ministry so right now we are doing a work of apostles doing the work of a prophet doing a work of evangelist doing the work of a teacher doing for pastor i've been doing this thing for many many years but it takes god to place me in the position that's something different that is something absolutely different they come like if you ask a question to you do you believe they are false anointed ones not in the way that was prophesied they are bridging who are false they are blessed who are teaching false teachings and false doctrines they are false but they are not anointed false yet when the anointing strike then they become the anointed ones faults but for now maybe god could flip them wrong i don't know because when the door for the gentile was about open about to be open there was a man named saul that was fighting the church now if we stay back as the church and say saul false anointed he's fighting the message he's fighting inspiration we was going to be off because saul was going to become paul so that was the beginning so god gave saul that space flip him over he was changed to paul and we know he wrote the new testament and so like that that was in the beginning now this is the ending now there's the ending where the door of the gentile is about to be closed and seeds have been sown and you cannot change your seed mid harvest you cannot in the middle of your being a corn and you're saying you know what i want to be a peas no it's too late a little while you'll be a corn a little by you'll bear your hate or your animosity or your evil or your unforgiveness and a little while you're getting your harvest you can't change it even when the holy spirit told the prophet pick up the pendant right he said many the holy spirit said many true ministers will misunderstand that prophet so i cannot say this one false and that one verse no here's why the true anointing have to come forward first and we haven't seen that yet oh glory to god hallelujah we haven't seen that yet because dynamics will push forward the true anointed and this is where david coming off oh hallelujah oh glory to god i feel inspired now david god gets fed up with saul and god tells samuel go and anoint me a king of one of jesse's son we know the story david was not even considered by jesse he bring out all them star boys all them regulars and when samuel said is there any more because what i'm seeing here i have no witness the teaching was good the preaching was perfect the revelation was very good but the witness of the spirit wasn't there upon that prophet so yeah they say send some more is there any more they bring david unknown guy seen about she poured the oil upon him all right then david gone back into obscurity yeah yeah about david david seemed about sheep no david's father inspired to send david with some rituals for his brothers his brothers trying to embarrass him and belittling him and david said isn't there a cause because when david was leaving goliath made his role send me a man we know the story david gave a testimony that none of them had he had given experience that none of them had that is why he didn't care about sword and spear and armor and shield or even goliath size he said who is that uncircumstance i'm going to fight him that's the fightful ministry the fightful ministry going to take out goliath oh glory to god hallelujah in this message the faithful ministry going to be positioning place internationally to deal with the intellectual giants in this message oh gloria that's david's ministry that is christ's ministry oh blessed be the lord but about many meetings many men many ministers come to me and confess that they believe that name of jesus christ right to be baptized in but our organization will put us out you poor excuse he said take saul amma off he said give me the power and the strength of the holy spirit god send me with a slingshot no matter what it is how little um beat the enemy down david said this thing don't look right and you talk about the lion and the beer he said that's what the matter today god has got a lot of sheep that's gone astray the organization has stole them out and brought them into psychology god give us david's that's where the fight will come in god give us what david's oh hallelujah hallelujah god give us david's with the word of god and the power of god to direct it where we're going to meet these intellectual giants with all the phd and lld or give the lord a shout from 1965 to no them giants well big they grow real tall they're real big real organized but god give us some david i am telling you david ministry is going to be coming on the scene a fifo ministry ordained and anointed and appointed by god whom i hear them he said watch you say god give us david's plural with the word not not idi david's another one-man show david's okay with the word of god and the power of god to direct it when we go to meet these intellectual giants with all the phd whatever it might be give me the word of god and the power of the holy ghost and i tell you we can slay every giant on the field oh glory to god hallelujah we're not talking about local giants we're talking about giants on the field men who have influence and power over believers over bright churches because listen these spiritual man these guys they could control church but they can't control bride because christ is the head of the body called the church oh hallelujah david was the poorest excuse there was on the field to go fight with a giant he didn't have any of these big intellectual degrees he wasn't well trained praise god saul he was the best he had shoulders above the army he was the one auto went and fought him but he was scared and today we know we need a revival or or we know we need a stirring amongst the people it will not take a doctor of divinity it will take a weakling you say hallelujah that will take the word of god in the power of the resurrection of christ and say the thing it will bring christ to the country and let them see he can still open the blind eyes he can still heal the sick he can still raise the dead he is god he's a conqueror we need a david untrained in theological schools we need a man who knows nothing about that some little blowboy something somewhere stooped with stupid shoulders not much to look at will come walking down the road with the power of god you see a young man a man a god a minister a servant of god walking down with the power of god will embarrass all these intellectual slick talking preachers hallelujah the bible call them line and wait to deceive with the slayer of hand just doing tricks making you see what they want you to see not what god's saying you know not the vision you know they want you to see what they want you to see oh praise the name of the lord but abraham he said now watch no support of denomination no support of eclassical set up but in simplicity and the power of the holy spirit i fell on pentecost watch you say you won't be honest i played a bunch of these diction illusions which i call it two in a row but brother you'll have something in your hand as long as the spirit of god will get into that word it will conquer and bring back them lord sheep that gone astray oh my amen confess our weakness throw off your doctor of divinity show off your knew it all your membership strip yourself before god spiritually speaking and call yourself unworthy then god can go to using you and don't see it from your mouth bring it from your heart strip yourself unworthy call yourself unworthy no they call himself the holy ghost the bible say you are the temple of the holy ghost a man conquered a revelation you are the holy ghost a lion spirit doctrines of devils and people believe that foolishness literally believe that the words they receive in the holy ghost they are the holy ghost now they have not even cry for the holy ghost because they are that deceived mine so david that the strip themselves he was among the weakest among the whole crowd think of it tens of thousands of hundreds of thousands of soldiers on the hill all of them trained every one of them with a phd every one of them with spears they were soldiers each one of them corporal so and so private so and so private general so and so luton and so on so i'm still reading great foster general saul bishop your honor sir every one of them standing there train men and the enemies tying a fixer saying you bunch of cowards up in the camp come a little shoulder oh god like a ruddy looking fellow little slingshot over his back with a reason tying his hand from here for his brother and that giant come down and make her cry once too often and said you mean to tell me you bunch of trained soldiers will stand there and let that uncircumcised defy the army of the word of the living god are you afraid of him what was it david was the most annoying of the bunch no school of fighting nothing like that at all but he trusted god his faith was in god he says satan has his intellectual giants you remember they said there were giants in atlanta and them these giants he still has them intellectual giants isn't that right intellectual giants come are wrong to prove that all they shouted saying amen going to the altar breaking up for your sins that is just emotion that's an intellectual giant they want to worship they don't want to shout they don't want to alter call they want people to just raise their hand and stick their hand down like that but we want the old time singing old times shouting old time preaching oh give the lord some praises hallelujah glory i could hear murder he shouted hallelujah that's the intellectual giant walk up dry eye just say joint church well i believe jesus christ you know and say well i'm being positionally pleased i have a knowledge of the word let's continue this is going good this morning praise god why aren't going because i'm saying going good no because this is the word watch that's why the always god equipped his army with the baptism of the holy ghost okay come back up a little bit that's the intellectual journal there's no such thing walk up dry and just say well i'll join this church well i believe jesus christ son of god satan does too no sign that he's saved it takes more than that it takes a new birth it takes a new book not just seeing that here we go it takes something that happens in here that makes you different see that's why here we go the always god equipped his army with the baptism of the holy ghost he knowed who he know these intellectual giants would stand in this last day he know they would stand and they will be able to explain by their wisdom he called it powers of satan peter said they're like a roaring lion devouring what we will now i'm not talking about outside them in this message i'm not talking about people outside okay the intellectual giants they are here in this message hallelujah and david ministry go get them david's ministry going to deal with them hallelujah and that is a type of the fightful ministry oh glory to god hallelujah so watch they're like a roaring lion but i'm continuing deeper he said i'm not going to leave you comfortless i'm coming again i'm going to be with you he equips his army with the baptism of the holy ghost go up there every one of you and wait luke 24 49 behold i send the promise of my father upon you but towering the seat of jerusalem until you'll be enjoyed performing high and after this the holy ghost is come upon you then you'll be witnesses of me in jerusalem judea plum on down to the uttermost part of the world so when the holy ghost fell and the fire began to fall again they were all filled with the holy ghost not taught about the holy ghost not understand what is the holy ghost they will fill with it whatever it is they will fill with that that is the promise hallelujah another bunch of men explaining this and explaining this the object is to get not god wit not god above or wit but god in honolulu and the baptism of the holy ghost is what puts god in brother branham so now god knowing this is good that in the last days will come intellectual giants they will come everything intellectual all kinds of reasoning god packed in the baptism of the holy ghost with what speaking with tongues interpretation of tongues prophecies gifts all kind of things they may seem hard in training but brother on the battlefront every one of them has got to be used so it can't be the preacher only it cannot be the pulpit only it has to be the tongues interpretation of tongues prophecy gifts are healing every gift you want your eyes your nose your toes you want all part of your body oh give the lord some praises hallelujah glory to god god equipping soul is exactly what it takes to use one they might say just learn psychology that won't work that's as thin as i brought made up of the shadow of a chicken that starts to death that's no good we have to have power of the holy ghost coming upon a man with all the nine spiritual gifts dwelling in him you say i just don't like to get out i don't like to pray all night i don't like well then you're going to get killed in the battlefront you stay there till god equips you with the baptism of the spirit then everything you've got need of in this world or the world to come lives right in you that's why jesus said behold the kingdom is within you oh glory to god and by further revelation the prophet identified the kingdom is the word made spirit and power in your life he said the words that i speak they are spirit and they are life oh give the lord some praises do we have some shelters in the house this morning hallelujah in your house are you shouting the praises of god this morning let your neighbor hear you oh glory to god let the devil hear you let the devil hear you what side you're on whose side you're on oh my the all-wise god knowed how to equip his army he equipped with the baptism of the holy ghost that's exactly what he sent these in last days he knew we would have to have it are you ready here's why hear the bomb he knew we would have to have it he knew that people would reason would go to reading this word when it become in print out here what would happen so this wise god know that in his last days the word will get in print where people could read and reason reason and read read and reason that is why i have so much uh a a way called disinformation now people want to say things contrary all kind of foolishness on the internet because listening or hearing some rasta profit from jamaica and sometimes some mountain and a bunch of people up there mountain they say he was interviewed by bbc and and so on like that and he's talking about so long he's talking about his virus coming years ago i know they're up on the land and they're waiting for jack to come and you know quoting scriptures and different things like that and talking about deep population and all kind of deep population i said what does this have to do anything deep population and this virus come to depopulate who controlling that somebody said depopulatory in that deep uprising america deep it's also foolish but then i satan planned satan said i want bodies to use satan jealous you doing mother's body he can't come now an earth he's a disbodied embodied spirit oh glory looking for bodies to use the bible said except god shortened the the time or no flesh shall be saved because the supernatural running around punt oh glory to god the earth was blacked out the holy spirit droid blacked out and put around and put a little sliver of light to represent you and i oh we should be praising and thanking god organized conspiracy theories all kind of nonsense we're not here to preach that we have a preacher solid word solid promises by these promises you can become partaker of his divine nature or give the lord some praises hallelujah praise god praise god praise god so don't fight any vaccine them them upon a mountain after eating jar food eaten eaten italian food oh hallelujah praise god amen they feeling like the escape ones on the mountain up there oh so the otherwise god knowing how to equip the people with the the equip them with the battle he goes that's exactly he knew we would have to have it why he knew that people would reason they would go to reading this word when it come out in print then whether they print you could twist it remember peter and them didn't have it in print you know peter them had old testament scripture but the new testament they were the living word what was their spoke common print but they had nothing to print to make a record as such they actually manifested and produced another book of acts which become our record oh give the lord some shout booker peter book of philippians book of romans holla book of corinthians that become the new testament by men that was living so you had to actually take these men as living word speak in the word of god that's why paul could say if i preach some other gospel when i first preached that may be a curse oh if an angel come from heaven preaching in the gospel so today there's intellectual giants there's men who are great men great powerful men they could set everything together so intellectual but where is that revival where is that god that burns on the heart of the human being it takes simplicity to bring the power of god that's a good one it takes what simplicity to put the bring the power of god he said it takes the simplicity of believing god to make his word speak out to show that jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever it takes a humble act dedicated to god to bring jesus christ in the present tense oh glory to god hallelujah you want to see jesus it takes a certain heart a humble heart dedicated to god to bring jesus christ in the present tense it's not my mind it does not take knowledge it he said it it does not take knowledge it's not my power it's not by might but it's by my spirits here the lord i'll unfold this mystery and we will cry to it grace grace with shoutings oh blessed be the name of the lord hallelujah so jesus had proven that he was the right kind of son so cody just take jesus for granted he was he had to prove he was the right kind of a son and you know he was adopted and he said they said that's the thing that god will do for his sons here on earth someday he will call you a side church if you'll only obey him and stay on the word and believe it he will place into the church he will place where into the church before the coming of jesus christ he replaced into the church all the powers that christ had in him will be in the church all that god was he poured into jesus all that jesus was he pours into the church god wanted his work done he sent it into his son his son wanted the work done he sent us into the church at that day you shall know i am in the father the father me and you and you and me at that day because the same power here we go that was in jehovah god rested in jesus christ and the same power that resident jesus christ rest in placed sons in the body of christ and that is why i say the true anointed comfort yet because it take dynamics to push them forward or let me rephrase that it will take a manifestation to push them forward or give the lord some praises understand this if david had wear uh the army saul and them armor he is just like your sediment where any amman defeated when the armor all of my name all of my spear and shield helmets and whatnot he can't go like that they have all the armor they have all this stuff and they're still defeated the cafe is going so david have to show him have something different he has faith in god he said god will deliver you into my hands glad prophecy i'll feed her to the birds and wherever it is and david probably said right back here back down you know you probably said take your head off today you are mines hallelujah you are living here alive oh glory to god i did limit you that's the fight for ministry david ministry going to step forward what kind of measure is that fearless anointed hallelujah met god on the backside it takes a manifestation to push david forward how else could they ever be recognized except god prepared the environment for david to step forward the beer the lion that was backside of the desert experience the anointing upon him is only his brothers were witness to that all that is in the god's private dressing room but you see when god created the environment for david to step forward to deal with goliath that was public there's a public show there's a public ministry to identify this is my son he's anointed he is commissioned he is dealing with intellectual giants on the field or give the lord some praises this is the fight for ministry of tight hell not grumbling behind some pulpit and throwing on this brother and training on that church that not that there are no fighter ministry hallelujah this is what we're talking about here david's ministry oh do you love him this morning glory to god so brother brahm says here watch so watch the same power that rested in jesus christ rest and place sons in the body of christ placing of a son take him out to a certain place he's explaining it i don't need a deeper explanation than that take him out to a certain place have a ceremony before angels place him positionally in the body of christ then that person has the authority let me say this if you caught me a fanatic from this night on that's the very same thing that i'm speaking of will be done there will be a power put into the church and now coming in noticing you talk about the mystery talking mystery revealing mystery unfolding he said there's a power coming into the church and now it's coming in that the holy spirit not some man some message man some fightful man some only man know that the holy spirit will so anoint the people till they will speak the word it will create ourselves right there we haven't seen powers yet it is coming into the church now i know it for as a fact hallelujah see that means god gave him vision he knows as a fact it's solidified say unto this mountain don't talk in your heart but believe that what you said shall come to pass you can have what you said the placing of the church in position where the fullness of the power of the holy ghost comes into the church then the critics mouth will be shot so right now let them talk let them pray let them brag let them boast let them laugh that's okay here's the promise here that the fullness of the power of the holy ghost comes into the church then the critic's mouth will be shut there will be a short time jesus come right off the mountain straight to calvary but it won't last long but it will be here what a prophecy but anthony he said it won't last long but it will be here so let them laugh let them mock let them scoff let them say be crazy but i know the critics mouth will be shut you notice when david you lose that stone my goddamn other philistines they begin to run they fled oh glory to god hallelujah david drop that sword on the light head and then guys have to take off and when god becomes anointed david ministry the fightful ministry they're gonna lie at them philistine go run oh glory to god they're gonna run all over the country they're gonna be running because god will identify david's ministry fight for ministry oh hallelujah oh critics mug will be shot not now let them criticize they're supposed to criticize hallelujah but abraham says there are so many voices in the earth today that is absolutely a heart thing to hear the voice of god because there's the death is the voice of the supernatural there are so many intellectual voices great voices of mighty men now they are mighty men you know mighty men who are intellectual and in the intellectual condition they're shaking nations we just they had knowledge nation shook ministers shook churches shook because nobody knew it like them nobody could explain like them nobody could show it repeatedly like them they're shaken up nation without power shaking a nation without spirit that's the head at work anointed grey mata they are not overnight people but they shake nations bringing great organization together great campaign flourish and a person would be a bit confused it's enough to confuse them on how these things could go on and prosper and there are voices that are raised up that do these things and it causes the voice of god to be placed way back somewhere and i realize forget these guys to be effective deceiver they have to disconnect the people from the prophet clicks pull the plug on the prophet and then it gets focused on them oh hallelujah oh my i'll say this we have an android phone samsung right and that operating system is android but sometimes have a skin over it that that that is the that the ui the graphical surface over it all the other companies would have android the source is the android but they could put things over it so you see now our source is the bible that is the source code that's the original source that but could read the scripture the spirit of the prophet is subject to the prophets and after that scripture he could unfold church order because that is the key that is his source so every time he's called a scripture he's a mystery scripture so mystery is not just mystery a mystery is scripture a previously divinely hidden truth naughty finally reveal but with it leave a supernatural amen atmosphere around it and something like that isn't that right so every word that was revealed he had was to come from the scripture that when the angel came to him to open the seals he compared what the angel was telling him with the scripture i'm not saying there is no angel it's half angels talking to guys but it's what them saying if it's in the scripture so you have to able to match it up so i don't want to hear what bill gates saying about the population that is not my gospel i don't hear what this one's saying and that one's saying i'm not reading what them saying i want to know what the bible say in the last day be a super church that's what i know the people that know their god shall do great exploits that's what i know i have nothing with deep population and the vaccine and the vaccine and vaccine like foolishness like destruction they're so foolish all the time people die in a courier virus now the vaccine is the issue faction is mark the beast and the prophet said right now you're being mocked your judgment is later on and that he said that before that vaccine hallelujah ezekiel 9 cry and say seal those who ate take the vaccine that's the bible the scripture for that think about it now what the bible checking you already by the word oh my hallelujah but i'm talking about this now he said i'm the voice of god so he's prophesying they say how will we know is the voice of god so he's prophesying for our time when we would ask the question oh we will know is the voice of god he said because for today then it was a vindicated prophet talking about himself all right now today how we know is the voice of god because it will be a manifestation of the prophet's word this is god's prophet and a true voice of god only brings back brings back that real living supernatural god with a supernatural word with a supernatural manifestation of the true word oh my so i'm going to conclude with david here now david's ministry is to check the intellectual giants on the field by and with the power of god that's the fifo ministry to the bride body around the world so them giants they wouldn't escape no no no no they wouldn't escape god have david in type to show how they will be handled hallelujah it wouldn't be court versus quote it wouldn't be expedition versus explanation it wouldn't be debate versus debate this won't be an online debate and an online question and answer situation this is not that david ministry is the power of god the spirit of god oh god upon a true fightful ministry to deal with them with the electoral giants with power oh my then we come now to joshua ministry oh hallelujah oh do you love him this morning glory to god i've shown you the fight for ministry and types joshua now after the other moses servant of god read the scripture go tell joshua the moses is dead all right let's go over this jordan don't want all these people into the land which god gave to them every place if your foot should i try to point that out of him to you now remember this god is talking loud speaker they know the lord speaker god talking you know god shouting joshua and everybody hearing that that god telling that no god tend not to judgment the people hear that that's not the voice for the people that's the voice for joshua so he had to obey god right there shall not be any man so he described from the river river euphrates and so on like that and the wilderness going on to the sea shop your coast there shall not be any man be able to stand before thee always of thy life as i was with moses so i will be with thee i will not fail thee nor forsake thee thy quarterly joshua the people don't know nothing about that the people just watching joshua they don't know as god was with moses he is now with joshua they don't know that they have no revelation of that all they know is this man that was moses minister is now stepping forward to lead us that's all they know so he's an unknown yet known just as moses minister he's no prophet he ain't no preacher thing he's just moses minister he's dead with moses everybody joshua look moses all right he told him mate in the world there night so but abram says hear this now here we go and there's a great lot of types we could go into we'll bypass some of them for instance like moses brought the church up to sinai to their theology of last night moses was not permitted to take the turn over into the promised land because he had failed so barbara is preaching and the church organization denomination has failed they will not take the church over god will raise up a new system an interdenominational system by the power of god that will take the church into the promised land organizations and denominations has messed it up each one after their own theology each one after their own thinking but god will take his holy spirit and will raise up his joshua's plural that will take the church to the promise with no denominational string tied anywhere but will take over his church he will take his holy spirit and raise up his joshua's who is that ministry fight for military type oh glory to god the guys that god gonna raise up to take the church over oh glory to god hallelujah moses had failed he was a lawgiver joshua was called of grace he took the church on we find that joshua knowing his commission knowing it lays in his hand god had called him for a duty and he must not fail he had to walk softly before god he said how the church ought to look this morning to what for what to find a spirit working amongst the people if you want a church home where the spirit that raised christ from the dead the holy spirit that will move among the people not just pulpit holy spirit oh glory to god hallelujah thank you lord jesus watch the spirit are real all right okay he said god called ministers he said god called ministers ought not to be stuffed up with theology but but have visited the land to where we are going bringing back evidence of divine love and the power of jesus christ to make known to dear congregation that there's a lambian river now last night preaching going up jordan and when we get to that river it divides us it separates us on the other side something has to happen oh my now joshua knowing what command was great and having the assurance he could be fearless he could be as we call it reckless as long as he was pointed the right way notice david ministry fearless look at joshua ministry fearless because he was pointed the right way oh glory to god and so can the church of the living god be reckless and fearless in faith if we are pointed the right way for he said as i was with moses i will be with thee i will not fail before forsake sake he'd never forsake moses he never failed moses he will not fail joshua he will not fail us as i was at malachi 4 so will i will be ephesians 4 the true fifo ministry oh give the lord some praises hallelujah [Applause] so that was joshua one right joshua tree this is this joshua said unto the people sandify yourselves for tomorrow the lord will do wonders among you joshua speak unto the priest saying take up the ark of the covenant passed over before the people and they took up the ark of the covenant and went before the people and the lord said unto joshua so just spoke to the people now god talking to joshua the lord said in joshua this day will i begin to magnify thee in the sight of all israel oh glory hallelujah my god if you find a camp this day will i begin to magnify thee in the sight of all israel that they may know that as i was with moses i will be with thee all glory to god all the time trust and know it privately but no god going to make it publicly as i was with moses i am going to be with thee give the lord a shout for a field fire and a building oh glory to god hallelujah thank you lord jesus notice look at what god did there all that talk was moses joshua in his ears privately no god telling joshua listen man i'm going to open this thing i go and show the people i'm going to magnify your ministry oh that's the fight for ministry hallelujah when god take man aside give them something to shake the nation with shake the whole nation the lord said to joshua this day will not begin to magnify thee in the sight of all israel and they that they may know that as always moses i will be with thee and thou shalt command the priests that bear the act of the covenant saying when you come to the brink of the water of jordan you shall stand still in jordan and joshua said unto the train of israel come here hear the words of the lord your god and joshua said hereby he shall know that the living god is among us no joshua have the anointing joshua know what god is about to do so joshua is telling them and hallelujah praise god and jesus said hereby he shall know that the living god is among us not because we have a book not because of our taste but because something's about to happen there's going to be a manifestation that you're going to know that the lord god is among us oh glory to god hallelujah give the lord a shout out joshua said hereby you shall know that the living god is among you that he will without fail drive out from before you the canaanites the hittites the hivites the perizzites the kershawshites the amorites and the jebusites behold the ark of the covenant of the lord is the earth passing before you into jordan and therefore take you twelve men onto the tribe of israel out of every tribe a man it shall come to pass as soon as the souls of your feet of the pre shall bear the act of the lord the lord of all the eight shall rest in the waters of jordan that the waters of the jordan shall be cut off from the waters that come from them above and they shall stand upon a heap oh so he prophesied joshua prophesied and said listen when them guys for touch that water i'm going to open up oh give the lord i shout oh glory to god you talk about divine leadership you talk about divine appointment oh glory to god hallelujah oh glory [Applause] he said once you know what notice were taking place there was esau moab he said no brother the real church of god has got no forms no creeds led by the power of god in every individual heart passed by your brethren his brethren don't fuss at them we are greater than they don't fuss at them just go by he said watch he said many of those people are actually borderline believers justification left egypt sanctification praise god he said but the third stage was when they crossed jordan into the promised land where the inheritance laid what you lutheran believe in justification and you met this nazarene's church at god believe in signification killing of the evil that's in you taking all the root of evil belongs right but to you men and women there is something in you calling you out the deep to the deep there's a jordan yet across a land beyond the river oh my he said you're going to pass by your bridge and i started your journey right you're going to pass by your brethren and they're near the borderline no if you're passed by them don't say nothing to them i have given the east of this mountain i've given more of this country i know why you're fussing at them press the lighting oh god hallelujah don't push the light you'll get more bodies and you'll get your children just move gently you know where you're going don't take up the habits oh i'm going to skip down we'll leave bill i'm alone and then fellas some other time tell him guys he said if all your deep you've got have been satisfied stay where you are but for me and my house for me there is something more than we have seen there's a land beyond the river somewhere they said a deep calling to the deep i cannot be satisfied with theology i cannot be satisfied with a good church i cannot decide with a good campaign i cannot be sized with a healing service there is something beyond that that calling oh man i've given esau this mountain don't touch him i've got something different for you cross over praise god are you ready let everything go wrong let everybody else prosper let errors prosper let the men who have a former godliness deny the power of prosper show view back but if you know where you stand you withstand regardless if the whole world turns you down you will not vary from that word my hallelujah oh thank you lord jesus brother branham praise god this is from paradox you see what coming down to the jordan meant we are done here now let's cross over now let's quit playing let's cross the other side now because it all belongs to us it's all ours then visions has never failed they can't fail because they come from god i believe it with all that is within me we are not the howling that would run back into the wilderness we will cross jordan the separation god break to us the seals that's on the back of the book in other words break to us them seven thunders on the back of the book let us enter into that great place now for joshua they violated the people the inheritance that god had left for them now the commission that joshua was threefold we know it cross over fight and conquer and then divine you cannot divide what you have not conquered and you cannot conquer if you don't confront let me say it again you cannot divide what you have not conquered and you cannot conquer what you're not prepared to confront and it's interesting how god put jericho just right in front of joshua the first thing the hardest thing jericho and when they could conquer jericho you could conquer anything and god showing not by might not by power but by the captain the captain of the host that follow instructions obedience come on now come on now oh glory to god tested on obedience and then you get the victory on the obedience all right but abraham said this now hallelujah we cannot have a revival until we got men god called men so you know how blast men are blast number six had to say them hard because i i got terribly uh was a terrible experience in my early years in this message in trinidad to see men manipulate people's lives i hated it if you're spitting all the color you spit you want a little house to buy what car to buy where to go go to school not to go to school don't do this all control many of them have destroyed life and never even repented of it that's right take people out of the school affect people's careers people's future and life and family and everything else yeah i rejected all of that yeah one time i i go to the same attila when he said pretty pants because i thought that is what you're supposed to wear i buy wool pants and all because people buying wool until the ants bite holes inside the pants i recognize them through that here you don't need that kind of pants until i change my tailor and all i want when actually telling them because i wasn't wearing any pants like he's like by the pants you shall know them those with the deeds i was a radical i want to look like this hallelujah you say become a revival until we get men god called men one two god trained men that is not trained up in the school of theology and education but rocket men of faith and god has brought up in the school of his rugged training men who are not afraid to face the fire men who has come into the presence of god that knows this power that knows his omnipotence that knows his healing power some men are trained out to know the living god it's all right they're trained by the word but they let her kill it but the spirit gave it life and before we can have this revival god has to call out men and train men god trained men to carry this message they don't care what the opposition is they're willing to go to the fiery furnace and defeat to the alliance then whatever maybe they're ready to go because they have been in the presence of god and know that he is whether the victory or defeat they still stand the same that's the kind of training god does to men it's very strange to think that god would do that that god trains men like that but he does god leads his people to great trials to purge them to what you know these criminal viruses are pushed into yeah it's bringing out what people it's bringing believe what in people's heart and i recognize people don't believe this message you know they may mess it but they don't believe what braham says they believe what the pastor telling them and they said chicken is a man on board examining horns they check any horns hallelujah god leads people through great trials to purge them and sometimes it takes years to do that not months not weeks years as for myself tonight i believe that right now god is training such men to meet the front line who are going through time shook from their feet sometimes looked like the whole thing has fallen yet in the midst of it all they know the living god and keep their face forward and when usually when god about to do something in the supernatural realms he usually gets a man that he could put his trust in and anoints him and sends him out and he is fearless at the job that's the kind of man we need today not polish scholars but men who know god in the power of his resurrection oh it means have a scholarly knowledge and the power of actual knowledge that's right for instance there was a man in the bible by the name of moses who had got all his training he knew all the theology he knew everything he should know he would have needed an education he could teach the masters of israel in israel or egypt he didn't he didn't need one thing and the bible tell us that he was learned in all the wisdom of the egyptians why he could teach their scholars he could teach a scientist he had keyed up every point when it comes to intellectual and yet here we go it took 40 years to beat all of that out of him all day in the sands when he got all his intellectual conceptions of god beat out to him out in the sands the metal was ready to be moulded over and that's the way god takes his men beats out all their fears all the intellectuals and when the great master potter puts them on the wheel and begin to moan them over again workmen worthy is god's man who could train a man more than god himself watch the way he trains him oh my hallelujah praise god hallelujah i'll be coming to elisha hallelujah living in the pub with 12 yuka oxen are you going to take your eyes off the plug it go go zigzag it go go so he had to keep his eye focused you got to keep his zero you can look back hallelujah when he when that elijah dropped demand on him and pull it off so he said wait wait i'm coming back he burned the auction he burned the whole thing he was single focused he said coming after you i felt something i felt a power oh god not church i could hold me hold me hallelujah hallelujah i want a manifested reality oh praise god amen isn't that right amen so you have to train some men afterwards keep them on the bible on the word lined up with the word say straight in line so god had to school him a little bit for elisha you tarry here for i'm going over to giga the lord has called me oh my hallelujah praise god thank you jesus he went to the giga place a christian confession and baptism he said just no no that's that's that's good enough you owe me the confession that's good now watch that wouldn't be all right for any professor but you stay right here but listen elijah couldn't think that way you know he already felt the power of god see that's the problem people don't know god's power there's no going on presence they never encounter supernatural or the believers intellectually what they're hearing is the word they're sincere they're believers they believe the word but they never had a breakthrough experience like how moses had it oh like all the children of israel had it like all the people have in the ulysses had it rather say oh my he said let me tell you something now a man that ever tasted god will not be willing or cannot quench his taste at a man-made system he can't do it all the theology they had at the school of the prophets could not quench the taste of that man of god he had a taste for god and they kept persuading him you should stay here why in six weeks or just he said he said watch do you know your head will be taken away today you say yes i know it but hold the peace in other words save your breath don't try to tell me about it don't try to tell me what i'm doing i know where i'm going what i'm after god give us men like that god trained men who knows not to wiggle off of this wiggle off and that i know i am going don't speak to me about it hold your breath don't try to discourage me because it's not going to do any good oh hallelujah that's the fightful ministry in type hallelujah no intellectual through the amount actually the prophet said this way not the prophet the spirit that took him picking away he said no man can make them do otherwise no man no part of the planet earth could make them do otherwise they have thus shared the lord or they keep still and thus a lot ain't coming from any pulpit just say lord come from the prophet we have to say back what the tips say to bring it as thus say the lord will give the lord a shout the bible love dustin why why because the spirit the prophet and the bride will be saying the same thing and what they say you make sure you made that well already been said in the word oh god because that prophet malachi 4 is revealed every mystery all the mysteries is to be revealed by that elijah all not but some all and if all has been revealed we don't need another man to come bringing like he could reveal something the prophet did not reveal he's a liar a false teacher a false prophet or give the lord some praises all the mysteries of god would be revealed by that elijah yes we could come and preach back the mysteries we can come and unfall back the mysteries but he has revealed every mystery oh give the lord some praises hallelujah don't try to discourage me cause it's not gonna work elisha said we are going to jordan and the two went on god requires a jordan in every life my lord wow bahram said the old prophet was really trying them out stay here stay there there's some people they have a testimony i could give a testimony since the prophet told me to stay right here better than the last 40 years i am here i'd better i am moving no revelation none no vision that's why they're better that's where they are giggle that brother jericho that's why they stay there permanently they die in there but not elijah no no no no he caught a vision the vision was driving him so let's go not elisha not that man who had once been touched by god felt the power of the anointing upon him he said as the lord lives as your soul never dies i will not leave you he had a purpose he saw the vision he knew what he was going to take place and they both went under jordan jonah means death there they stan i love this part the old man and the young man it represents christ and his church and there they stood by the jordan there she is coming down the judean hills the great riffles rolling like that elisha with his gray hair hanging on his back his dimmed all eyes looking across jordan and the young man watching every movie made one the young man was waiting for vision to carry the will of god the other was going home my pause is raised when i read that hallelujah praise god the old man going home and the young man waiting for vision to do the will of god and when god take elijah up he came back with a double portion of his spirit he was ready for the revival of them notice the man then a poor boy before god made his name immortal i want you if you could connect with three dots between david ministry joshua ministry and he likes the ministry elijah ministries boy unknown hallelujah just some plow in the field god tell him that manga replaced it dropped the mantle on him and the mantle all glory that god felt on the day of pentecost and that mantle that fell nintendo cause going on jumping a fifo ministry one more time the spirit of elijah oh glory to god will rest upon elijah this is a fight for ministry oh glory to god elijah is a type elijah the type of that oh my praise god but ibraham said this notice the man then just a poor boy before god made his name immortal all the prophets that stood around watching him had to bow to his feet because he had the power of god upon him hallelujah not books not quotes not intellect not i get a revelation you know what come to me not that you're the power of god upon him all them devils couldn't move and but the brown wasn't wrong they couldn't say a peep when he was wrong oh glory to god because they know god was with him oh hallelujah i take every spirit under my control for the glory of god which man talking that talk now oh give the lord a shout there's going to be adopted sons with the ministry of jesus christ in the last days hallelujah then he prophesied after this year then he prophesied there is coming an hour when god will make the world bow at the feet of men and women who have plunged through and cross jordan did you hear that did you hear that prophecy there is coming an hour when god shall make the world bow at the feet of men and women that has plunged through and crossed jordan and separated them from the things of the world brother and sister tonight whatever you do whatever you think you cross journal with god go over and separate and leave the world behind let god train you for his own service oh my hallelujah we are living in a day before this revival and god institutional trying to find hearts oh my hallelujah so elijah mantle is the spirit revolution 22 17 the spirit and the bride say come oh glory to god when god dropped the mantle on the bride the bride will be given a voice hallelujah that's why he said the voice of god will be in her he will confront the church by the spirit and the bride you're going to confront the world through them because the world is the church of the world the church message world is no longer speaking for god they speak in their own message they're speaking known in revelation they're making a mockery that we don't need a prophet they need it then he can't get these guys gods and a prophet with all their messages for us to hear these guys with their thoughts and revelation what about the prophecy that the prophet brought so i brought these three types to show you david's ministry joshua ministry elisha ministry david ministry dealing with the intellectual joshua ministry he calls jordan elijah ministry across jordan vote debt have to die let's let's listen to what the prophet said about this fight for ministry now lust for money lots of big things lust for popularity these things are dead to the believer he said we don't care a tent or cottage why should i care live or die sink or drown this is the thing that i'm interested in the kingdom of god whether i maintain my home whether i maintain my family whether i maintain whatever it is let me maintain christ our hope and glory and then he said this build me up oh lord into this let christ be my head that's working through me so this is ministry now okay on my foundation my fee that's in him led virtue knowledge temperance patience godliness brotherly kindness work in me oh lord is my prayer i don't care live or die sing or drunk denomination or no denomination friend or friend let that work in me let christ's virtue his knowledge flow out that i might be able to teach those let christ's virtue his knowledge flew out so he's not talking about revelation here now he's talking about the actual possession and when we talk about virtue we're not talking about the text virtue or reading about virtue or using the word virtuous virtue we're talking about what left jesus when the woman where the blood is you touch him he said i felt virtue left me i don't know what you tired any pulpit i never remember that kind of vote you please no we're not talking about that you're wary and you're tired like what you like you i'm not talking about that not that kind of what you're talking about i'm talking about the virtue that heals the future that delivers the power oh glory to god that oozing out leaking out that man of god fifo minister it's going to be because there will be some adopted sons that's the fight for ministry you know the fight for ministries really adopted sons let me say it again the fifo ministry will be adopted sons because adopted sons will have the ministry of jesus christ oh glory to god for god has set in the church right after that he said let us work in me let christ virtue his knowledge flow out that i might be able to teach those for god are set in the church apostles prophets teachers pastors evangelists all for the perfecting and his detailedness now all for the perfection you know man says like you talked for the fighting church no but here yes all for the perfecting and bringing all these virtues into it oh that's different now that is more detailed of the job description not just perfecting not just preaching and teaching but bringing the virtues into it how do we do that by a text by a message we have to have that to impact that we have to have that in us to give out that all for the perfecting and bringing all these virtues into it for the perfection of the common son of god each one of these stones our material offered that one this is the material of this each one of those virtue belonging to him oh my oh blessed be the name of the lord o praise the name of the lord hallelujah all right are you ready we are done yet we're still in here we're still in the cockpit now what jesus said watch this now the works that i do he's doing them right now but obama is speaking the works that i'm doing now healing the sick raising the death open the eyes of the blind these works shall you do also you will do these if you believe in me you will do these works and then are greater than this shall you do for i go to my father little while the world will see me no more but you will see me i'll be with you even in you to the end of the world i would not leave you comfortable no notice here we go the greater works was to have the power in the church not only to heal the sick by prayer or cast castle devils by prayer but to impart eternal life to believers aha now this sticks in a different door altogether this is a different door there's not there's a different door let me read it again now the greater works was to have the power was to have the power in the church not only to heal the sick by prayer cast out devils by prayer but to impart eternal life to believers the holy ghost was coming and given into the hands of the church to impact life oh that's what calvary meant it took stoop degraded men and women and lifted them into a place to be sons and daughters of god to heal the sick and to impart eternal life by giving the holy ghost to obedient believers men who were once unbelievers will be made believers and impart spiritual eternal life how much great it is to see this sick woman laying here i can pray a prayer of faith and she'll be healed that's a great thing that's what he's doing then but he said greater than this shall you do i'm going to give you power not only to raise him up for a while but to give him eternal life which will be eternal forever poor blind wretched people how do you miss that don't you see what the greater thing is the greatest thing that could ever happen was to impart eternal life to people what is eternal life the life that he lived the life that was in him in power to others can a man do that a son of god can a vindicated son a son with a pillar of eye in him an adopted son with the ministry of jesus christ oh give the lord a praise of friend there you are give the lord a shout hallelujah glory to god hallelujah that's from that dead calvary we know paul had the holy spirit do you believe that when he was 14 days nice upon the sea without moon and stars right and he went down to the gallery to pray and he came back and told him man we have got courage for the angel of god whose servant i am came to me last night and said fear not paul is that right not the holy spirit the angel of god sent from god not the holy spirit jesus said the angel now when john the revelator the book of relations wrote i sent my angel jesus did john fell into worship the angel but the angel said stand up worship god see the true angel won't stand to be worshipped he said he was of the prophets and his fellow servants that would signify these things therefore therefore angelic beings is ordained ministers of god to come to the earth to be a record of god and they work through mortal beings just as they did to daniel and back to the ages back there i believe it with all my heart so therefore friends as your brother that's all i am but god's gift is the spirit of god that came down in the form of an angel he didn't have wings he looked like a man i heard him when he walked just as that and walked on the floor walked right over just as normal as any man just stand there man he comes time and time through the room and different places when i am fasting and praying the gift is the spirit of god that come down in the form of an angel see that's the level the prophet was at when the angel was working with him in the early part of his ministry he said i represent the faith by way of a divine gift because the angel didn't come yet because he wasn't adopted yet for the angel to come into him to work with him in that way so he just had a gift he said i represent defeat because the fate is god god-filled oh hallelujah oh my let's continue we get in there we get in there i reckon the sufferings of this present time right now are not worthy to be compared with the glory which are revealed in us for the earnest expectations the creation waited for the manifestation of the sons of god isn't that right waiting for the manifestation of the sons of god it is waiting for the church to come into this position waiting god trying to place his church in position to manifest himself you see this is very important this morning because before you the believers are placed the minister have to be placed let me say it again before the church is placed the fifo ministry have to be placed because that is god's order that is just god's order so listen to this god trying to place his church in position to manifest himself getting one that he can work through like this and say there is my spirit flowing freely there it is i can work here for his spirit to fall freely it means that man like a pipe it could blow right through there's no hindrance there's no self there's no pride there's no personal ambition there's no issues he's like a pipe spirit could flow freely it could flow how there is my spirit flowing freely not coming down pouring out no flowing through him he becomes a channel of god there's my spiritual freebie there it is i can work here i get another one over here place him i can place him adoption placing manifesting adoption placing manifesting take him out there and put a ceremony on him visit him with an angel oh glory to god visible what an angel the gift of god the spirit working an angel when it comes to the pulpit the angel is standing right there with him not a devil move until he says so oh give the lord a shout hallelujah oh glory to god look at this elisha following elijah stay here stay here stay here notice when he accept the challenge across jordan no more talk stay anywhere when he crossed jordan what it is i could do for you he said double portion hallelujah he said stay focused son if you see me go you could have it so here i'm watching newspaper here and watching magazine he's not watching this on facebook and seeing what people say no no he watching the promise if you see me go you can have it now all the school of the prophets was watching you know they see when he went across the elijah you know they saw elijah open up the jordan you know they know he had a boat to come back he went by boat hallelujah so when elijah elisha got the mantle and fit it on he thought he had it now he tear up his own clothes his own ideas and put on the robe of elijah and he said wait a minute it looks more than this yes he wanted all these coats yes i get the mantle as he would but where is the fire where's the power he take he said where is the lord god of the election and he take the man and strike the jordan river and the river open up whatever that guy's gonna see they're watching from our fire when they see elijah walking backward a man you know what they say the spirit of elijah god rest upon elisha hallelujah troubling the enemy's camp oh glory to god a man from obscurity brought to jordan and come back with power oh hallelujah so watch uh uh watch he get get one he will walk through i can place him adoption placing manifesting he said take him out here put a ceremony on him visit with an angel tell him something now if he told the truth or if he making up something it won't work see no that won't work we have a lot of that i mean manifestations of sons of god when god manifests himself he sends him out and then he goes for it what he says is truth what he does is the truth what he does what he does he manifests christ how do you judge him by the way he stays with the word right with the word see that's how you know all men by the way he stays with the word if they speak not according to the word there's no life in them oh my oh my hallelujah let's go he presents his army in the form of five offices this is god now he presents his army in the form of five offices not playing a tape of brother branham in the church that is not his army he had put our army at a players the fifo ministry is not people playing tape that is not the word that was never taught by the prophet there's another teaching altogether like that's off all right listen to what the prophet saying here he presents his army in the form of five offices first apostles prophets teachers pastors evangelists that's his army that's his soldiers that's his commanding officers all with the baptism of the holy ghost i wonder which one they said i won 24 hours you still be lost it's not that you're talking about here right all this army here have the baptism of the holy ghost waiting out there to meet the enemy on any grounds he comes upon to meet the enemy with the word amen each one backing one another up not chopping one up backing one up see that's where the five hole is true fivefold because the spirit of god cannot behave in one man and misbehave in another man no something is wrong somewhere see each one backing one another up with him the chief captain here we go here's the part the main part not out here in front not up here above not back behind but in them that's the army glory the god the army is god veiled it will become to the unveiling of the mighty god in a fightful ministry called unveiled to the bride and the bright church unveiled to the rest of the world or give the lord some praises vindicating what his resurrection by the proof of his words my my my mind hallelujah i'm almost done okay so let's try now the ministry of jesus christ put a brand let's turn to ephesians four there's some perfect man he gave some apostles some prophets remember the last night don't try to take another man's office some evangelists some pastors some teachers for the perfection of the god does it read like that congregation says no the perfection of what the saints who are the saints the sanctified one is that right perfection of the saints for the working of the ministry the ministry of jesus christ so they like to say perfectly saints but by the working partner working of the ministry which ministry my ministry know the ministry of jesus christ for the edith of the body of christ amen for the building it up eddy fine until we come to the unit of the fate and the knowledge of the son of god onto a perfect man under the assurance to the measure of the statute of christ oh my god what about him the gentile church is in the laodicean the end of the laodicean age the jews are in the homeland already there and the gentile apostasy has already taken place we have a president like we have we have a nation that's broke up like we have we have atomic bombs hanging in the hangars we have the church that's lukewarm we have a church a people that draw themselves together we have a ministry that patterns the ministry of jesus christ for to catch the stone when it comes so the ministry of jesus christ is not to say we have the message jesus christ the ministry of jesus christ is to catch the stone when it comes what's left to happen it might be at any minute there is nothing else left we are the end time the church is weak the church is today we are broke up organizational strife separation of brotherhood methodist baptist presbyterian fiveness all kind of stuff we are broke up that's the way it's supposed to be you hear it that is the way it's supposed to be it's got to be that way here we go then there will come a message you say oh hallelujah we know that it's the same pillar fire that that israel we know that the same ministry that accompanied jesus christ by that pillar fire that had him anointed is accompanying the church today so the church mashup and all these disagreements and all these arguments and regional one and shaykh and and whatnot that is how it's supposed to be but then they'll confront a god ordained fightful ministry with the pillar of fire oh glory to god with the ministry of jesus christ do you see it now here it is science i prove it we don't need that god has proved it we need the ministry of jesus christ to fit that headstone coming under that was brought to church into the place he's praying now father we realize that the church has come through the stage of justification come to the state of signification come to the stage of the receiving holy spirit now the stones are being honed down for the fitting of the ministry of jesus christ to blend in to take the church and we get that last week wednesday that holy spirit slot my almost finished but see we could come up to the piano when a man in the foundry is making a bell he has got a certain tone he has to put in it when he is setting this mold and putting his iron puts in so much brass so much steel so much copper wire he knows exactly how much you put in and that's what jesus has done by his brain he had to put in so much looter so much methodist so much presbyterian so much pentecost in it but what does he comes out with his own reflection what is it just like the pyramid message you see it's heaping right up this come to the minority with the headstone the ministry of jesus christ on earth has to be the same as the ministry he had or he can't come to it just like the head to the feet the head feet is not the head but the head packs the feet that makes the feet tells it where to go wesley was a great light okay justification service time signification justification on the looter it had to come to simplification on the wesley and salvation service time until we come to the baptism of the holy ghost and the baptism of the holy ghost servants time until the holy spirit which is only one god blends into the church and the church unto christ it makes jesus christ reflected on the earth what he promised oh my i'm closing what ties all this together just referring and everyone close up you could begin to play something softly but it's even david anointed in the presence of his brethren private literally unknown god will design the environment for david to come forward by his father being inspired someday with food for his brothers just when goliath making his move god digged him from the back and brought him to the front fivefold minister in type hallelujah brought out of obscurity by manifestation [Music] but abraham talked about moses minister joshua he knew something had to take place he couldn't tell the people god called me angel spoke to me go tell me this otherwise moses no there had to be a manifestation that clearly identified that just as god was with moses he was a joshua hallelujah before the people it could be texts it can't be scripture it can be a message spoken it has to be a manifestation that come forward elijah was the same thing oh my god hallelujah friends i trust that this would help you to realize it's not a game it's not a a verbal game it's not a messages game it's real [Music] but abanamata comes to all his processes lost his wife he lost his daughter he lost the anointing god squeezed him and pressed him until he come just like jesus what about us we have our times ahead of us all this environment we're in right now is part of what god set up what he has arranged for us to come true on top this game let's bow heads heavenly father we thank you for your love and your presence and the audience here lord i'm so privileged to have shared this florida i'm not talking down to them i'm sharing this with them and my son will always say having a conversation lord and this is how it was partly but this is your word this is your truth lord where the sons of god be manifested father god i know many pastors ministers will disagree with what i have taught lord i'm not trying to fight with anyone but this is how i've seen it in the world it will take dynamics to positionally please this fightful ministry with the ministry of jesus christ the manifestation of

the life and the resurrection of jesus christ brought upon your people father may they understand by revelation inspiration the need to even pray for the ministry because the ministry must be placed first then they too can be placed for god a church that believeth in the holy ghost is just as real when they are born and positionally born then god sets in the church pastors and teaches the fight for ministry and on the deer have all the gifts returning oh god set the church in order father your prophet said what we need is a prayer meeting to say send on the adoption of the holy ghost oh god
