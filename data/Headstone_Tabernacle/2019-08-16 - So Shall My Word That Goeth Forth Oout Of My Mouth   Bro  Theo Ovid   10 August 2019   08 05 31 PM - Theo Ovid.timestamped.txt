[42:35] of the Lord came unto me saying son of
[42:38] man what is that proverb that you have
[42:42] in the Land of Israel
[42:43] seeing the days are prolonged and every
[42:47] vision feel it
[42:48] tell them therefore thus saith the Lord
[42:51] God I will make this provoke to cease
[42:54] they shall no more use it as a proverb
[42:57] in Israel but say unto them the days are
[43:01] at hand and the effect of every vision
[43:05] for there shall be no more vain visions
[43:08] of flattering dim ignitions praise God
[43:12] hallelujah blessed be the name of the
[43:15] Lord hallelujah praise be to Jesus there
[43:23] shall be no tell them for there shall be
[43:25] no more vain vision of flattering
[43:27] divination within the house of Israel
[43:29] for I am the Lord I will speak and the
[43:33] word that I shall speak shall come to
[43:35] pass it shall be prolong it shall no
[43:38] more
[43:39] for ended in your DS or rebellious house
[43:41] will I see the word and will perform it
[43:46] see it the Lord God again the word of
[43:48] the Lord came to me saying son of man
[43:50] behold day of the house of Israel see
[43:52] the vision that we see it is for many
[43:55] days to come
[43:56] and it prophesied of times that are far
[43:59] off
[43:59] therefore see unto them thus saith the
[44:02] Lord God they shall none of my will be
[44:04] prolong any more but the word which I
[44:07] have spoken shall be done

[44:13] you for the inspiration here we target
[44:15] for your people and your man servants
[44:17] lord I hear and become by the churches
[44:20] Lord may empower us to go as the
[44:23] laborers in your field and this time of
[44:25] harvest take me all to the way tonight I

[44:41] home in Trinidad we're certainly glad to
[44:43] be here and all those fellow laborers
[44:45] here it was minister of the gospel we
[44:47] had to put our shoulder to the wheel
[44:49] that we could press on towards the
[44:51] coming of the Lord
[44:52] our contact scripture like to read you'd
[44:55] have to find it it's on first
[44:56] Corinthians 347 and Paul was seen for
[44:59] one said I am of Paul another I am of
[45:01] apollos are we not carnal who then is
[45:04] Paul who is Apollo's but ministers by
[45:07] whom he believed even as the Lord give
[45:09] to every man I have planted Apollo's
[45:12] watered but God gave the increase
[45:14] so then neither is he that planted
[45:16] anything near the sea that watered but
[45:18] God that gave the increase
[45:20] today my context capitalist tonight and
[45:22] if a title a so shall my word be that
[45:26] goeth forth out of my mouth as the title
[45:29] so shall my word be that goeth forth out
[45:31] of my mouth and have a subject one saw
[45:33] it another water it but God gave the
[45:36] increase
[45:37] or praise the name of the Lord so we're
[45:40] looking forward to see what the Lord
[45:41] will not do tonight amen praise God I
[45:44] love the inspiration they that sow in
[45:46] tears shall reap in joy
[45:49] and I put some time on that that was
[45:51] like a burden in my heart to bring to
[45:53] the people you have to beat reveal you
[45:55] have to be a groaning you have to be at
[45:57] revealing you have to be a crying and
[45:59] sign the message has become very
[46:01] comfortable the message has become very
[46:03] flat where people are satisfied to know
[46:06] that they believe a prophet and there
[46:08] are books and tapes and they will
[46:09] grandma said no that's not the message
[46:11] you know your fire coming your your
[46:15] challenges is coming but a Branham out
[46:17] to face his own and so will the bride he
[46:20] said a private be a hunted persecuted
[46:22] group oh so you mean better over we're
[46:24] not going to sit down on a church bench
[46:26] I'm just gonna rupture no that's not
[46:28] happening
[46:28] that is not going to happen Oh glory to
[46:31] God the bride will go to a rough time
[46:33] well glory to God but we have a word
[46:36] from the Lord
[46:36] brick that his wood will not return void
[46:39] everything spoken about the bride will
[46:41] come to pass it has nothing to do with
[46:44] your feelings there's nothing to do with
[46:45] your emotions it have to do with what
[46:47] God have said or glory to God it has
[46:51] what to do what God have said and one
[46:53] time a prophet hadn't got angry and
[46:55] upset Elijah and my god want to know
[46:59] what's the word for the Lord what is
[47:00] word of the Lord and he said bringing me
[47:02] a minstrel because he in an upset mode
[47:05] and once there's a upset it has to have
[47:08] an atmosphere to bring the prophet in
[47:10] the spirit so he get the right singing
[47:13] and the music he said does hear the Lord
[47:15] dig me a valley full of ditches you
[47:18] wouldn't see win praise God he would me
[47:21] he'll win you wouldn't see rain but
[47:24] water going to come after them
[47:25] don't go by your feelings don't buy
[47:29] emotions don't my your feeling tonight
[47:31] Oh glory to God hallelujah and that's
[47:35] why we had that scripture he that we
[47:37] carry the will shall not sow we refuse
[47:39] the conditions around us
[47:42] we refuse to accept what does around us
[47:45] we're going to do what we have to do
[47:48] speak what have to be spoken and I shall
[47:51] surely come to pass do believe that even
[47:55] you will be seated oh praise God so
[47:58] brother Branham in Revelation chapter 4
[48:00] he was talking about the cherubims had a
[48:02] Freeman sword the Garden of Eden to keep
[48:05] the tree of the Tree of Life
[48:07] there was a Garden of Eden and this is
[48:09] the gate right here swings out at the
[48:12] gate there were turbines
[48:13] it said cherubims and they were to God
[48:16] the way of the Tree of Life he said who
[48:20] is the way Jesus they kept the Tree of
[48:23] Life and gathered it the way of life now
[48:26] you must remember that there was an
[48:28] altar at the Garden of Eden
[48:30] it's an altar this must have been an
[48:32] altar at the Garden of Eden I will tell
[48:35] you why you remember Cain and Abel came
[48:37] to worship so that shows that God's
[48:39] altar was moved and set there at the
[48:43] Garden of Eden and the only way back to
[48:45] Eden is by the altar the only way back
[48:49] to Eden is true the altar so the way
[48:52] back to Eden is by the altar and through
[48:55] the altar and that altar had to be
[48:57] covered with blood he say all kind of
[49:00] people see it nothing but the blood they
[49:02] had to be an atonement they had to be a
[49:05] mercy seat this is the author of
[49:07] judgment that must become a mercy seat
[49:10] God in this gate so Cain went out of the
[49:14] presence of the Lord from the kid at the
[49:16] garden so the presence of the Lord must
[49:19] have been by the altar or glory their
[49:22] God where I guess in the presence of the
[49:23] Lord right by the altar and the altar
[49:27] was at the gate and it's coach dwelling
[49:29] place and Kim went out from the presence
[49:32] of the Lord from this place

[49:37] earth as a pattern after heaven so any

[1:11:10] put it inside you and I so what put that
[1:11:13] seed like a miracle under the Seventh
[1:11:15] Seal put seven thunders under there and
[1:11:17] tied it right up inside of that on the
[1:11:19] nail that the devil will know nothing
[1:11:20] about it
[1:11:21] silence put the seed inside of you and
[1:11:25] the devil to know what's inside of you
[1:11:27] because he can't discern at heart or the
[1:11:30] thoughts inside aha so what put his seed
[1:11:32] inside of your heart no the devil can't
[1:11:35] get inside idea to mess with that seed
[1:11:37] or glory to God that seed is original
[1:11:40] that's either secure or glory to God do
[1:11:44] you believe that nothing wrong with a
[1:11:47] seasonal the ground becomes the issue
[1:11:50] stony ground hallelujah rocky ground
[1:11:54] poor negro hallelujah
[1:11:57] nothing is wrong with the message
[1:12:00] nothing is wrong with the seven thunders
[1:12:03] nothing is wrong with the seven seals
[1:12:05] nothing was wrong with this message
[1:12:08] [Applause]
[1:12:15] that's why I'm ABC's it that's like
[1:12:18] policy once I'm Apollo's I'm appalled
[1:12:20] and this easy ice carnal its flesh
[1:12:24] inside the way man getting in front ago
[1:12:26] to me affecting the flow of things and
[1:12:29] then he said one show one reap but one
[1:12:32] show on water but quad give the increase
[1:12:34] God is who want to bring the increase
[1:12:37] but somebody after so and somebody after
[1:12:40] water if you saw a seed is half tap
[1:12:43] water to bring it forth let's continue
[1:12:45] the Spirit of God comes forward to water
[1:12:48] the seed at this back up a bit you may
[1:12:49] be seated
[1:12:50] they don't smoke what is your own seed
[1:12:52] Jesus is the word of God and he was
[1:12:56] busted open the life is inside the seed
[1:13:00] and this life which is the spirit was
[1:13:05] water flowing over the spirit over the
[1:13:09] seed of God will bring forth the life of
[1:13:10] the seed and it bring forth something
[1:13:12] else there is some kind of see there do
[1:13:15] you understand if the Spirit of God
[1:13:18] comes forth to water the seed if it's
[1:13:22] the sea it is watering it will produce
[1:13:25] the life of the sea so when Jesus died
[1:13:29] water was released which the spirit was
[1:13:32] released because seeds were coming and
[1:13:35] that water release is to come to your
[1:13:38] seed so right now you haven't manifested
[1:13:41] what they're supposed to be yet because
[1:13:43] you're waiting for the water to come to
[1:13:46] your sea and every seed will be full
[1:13:50] after its kind Oh glory to God so he
[1:13:54] said I believe the Bible is the whole
[1:13:56] truth and Jesus the Word made manifest
[1:13:58] he was that seed that Eve should have
[1:14:02] produced he was the sea that Eve was to
[1:14:06] produce but she hybrid it by disbelieve
[1:14:09] in God's Word so he was the seed and the
[1:14:12] only way that life could be reproduction
[1:14:17] of life life had to come to that seed
[1:14:20] and in order to spread out the life
[1:14:22] can't you see it that is why the water
[1:14:24] was given to water the seeds the holy
[1:14:27] spirit that was in the Garden of Eden
[1:14:29] was the water the seed and that's what
[1:14:32] we will fight the holy spirit on the
[1:14:33] devil would fight the holy spirit and
[1:14:34] fight the atmosphere and fight the
[1:14:36] worship and have it on the Cana
[1:14:37] intellectual just talking talking
[1:14:39] killing time with no atmosphere and the
[1:14:42] atmosphere made the difference that's
[1:14:44] how you come to creature atmosphere he
[1:14:46] said one minutes like a bingo revival if
[1:14:47] the minister's cabin Reviver we should
[1:14:49] have it a long time ago he said every
[1:14:51] five I'll have to come by the people you
[1:14:53] have to been revival from when you're
[1:14:55] home some in your lives and when you
[1:14:57] come and understand by revelation and
[1:14:59] inspiration that you have to bring the
[1:15:01] revival not only that he said God is
[1:15:03] written for the people to call upon God
[1:15:05] to get his servants into action
[1:15:08] or we have another big men and big this
[1:15:10] and big Pope's I message Pope and who's
[1:15:12] the manager and what not all that
[1:15:13] foolishness that have to cut out there
[1:15:16] waiting on you if you don't pray the
[1:15:18] table moves the way they're supposed to
[1:15:20] move but when you come under expectation
[1:15:23] when you come on weekend the water with
[1:15:25] your praises and worship watch them men
[1:15:28] of God began to speak by direct
[1:15:30] inspiration
[1:15:31] what's corridors men or give the Lord a
[1:15:35] shock
[1:15:36] Oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah sis
[1:15:43] know how great the man is an ugly the
[1:15:45] pastor is and how good this evangelist
[1:15:46] is and how egregious one is it's not
[1:15:48] that who is Paul with the bottles one
[1:15:53] water one sure but his car but God give
[1:15:58] the increase
[1:15:59] all glory to God amen let me see that if
[1:16:03] you want the church start with the Word
[1:16:05] of God you want that life of God stop
[1:16:08] with the Word of God
[1:16:09] accept the word and its fullness no that
[1:16:13] is where you laughter in brothers coming
[1:16:14] up you see where you're going after a
[1:16:16] while he said no watch then the works
[1:16:18] will be manifested in him at the same
[1:16:20] for it is the same seed word of God
[1:16:24] God's Son was his example seed and if
[1:16:28] his life was when that spirit born after
[1:16:31] him and his baptism and the Holy Ghost
[1:16:33] come upon him here we go
[1:16:35] the very life that he produced that same
[1:16:39] water in spirit of the Holy Ghost will
[1:16:44] bring forth the same kind of a life
[1:16:46] doing the same thing he did if it is the
[1:16:50] same seed Son of God seed

[1:25:02] hallelujah Oh glory to God just a little
[1:25:07] more oh my this one this one is
[1:25:13] something special to me once I remembers
[1:25:16] Allah be seated I remember seen a year
[1:25:17] and six months in the book of Revelation
[1:25:19] and that is what I been teaching I love
[1:25:23] I just love teaching I think it's
[1:25:24] wonderful it gives the basis and settles
[1:25:27] the church no in preaching now there are
[1:25:31] some people are preachers they can pick
[1:25:34] up the word with inspiration and sweet
[1:25:37] audiences that is watering the seeds
[1:25:41] that the teacher has taught
[1:25:47] [Applause]
[1:25:48] they're not soup so if we don't have an
[1:25:55] understanding of how the gifts operate
[1:25:58] we could mystic things so the teacher
[1:26:01] brings the seed and a lot of people like
[1:26:04] the books and said you know the teacher
[1:26:07] positionally pleases you cobra I said
[1:26:10] that and the preacher the Evangelist is
[1:26:12] preach to a mine or something like that
[1:26:14] so they're making mockery and front of
[1:26:16] preachers and they have an affinity and
[1:26:18] a Cruces that I want to teach us but my
[1:26:20] question is what are you being pleased
[1:26:23] for if the teacher is placing you and I
[1:26:27] then you have to be placed for to
[1:26:30] receive power not place place that's my
[1:26:34] son I'm citizenship so that night nada
[1:26:35] placed the teachers kneel them into the
[1:26:39] place they can't move right now D taking
[1:26:42] notes in there please when they supposed
[1:26:44] to listen to tape for my right ear nose
[1:26:45] and worship God and create the
[1:26:46] atmosphere they place
[1:26:52] [Applause]
[1:27:01] we had 50 years of work mystery mystery
[1:27:06] mystery mystery si si si
[1:27:08] where are the preachers to bring the
[1:27:11] water to the very seed one soul but God
[1:27:22] gonna give the increase my my my
[1:27:34] hallelujah may be seated
[1:27:36] I know brethren who like to see Baran
[1:27:39] say and he's almost like a mockery he's
[1:27:41] a he's a very forceful speaker and he
[1:27:45] just rocked back on a soft and a
[1:27:46] teaching and a teaching but when when I
[1:27:49] preach I come
[1:27:49] he's a very forceful you know but Rama
[1:27:52] wasn't like that good he was the Prophet
[1:27:56] [Music]
[1:27:57] yeah yeah ah prophets prophesy
[1:28:00] let's continue an increasing there are
[1:28:02] some people that are preachers they can
[1:28:03] pick up the word with inspiration and
[1:28:05] straight out there in places that's
[1:28:07] water in the seas that the teacher has
[1:28:09] taught now you got to put some Syrian
[1:28:12] first and then water it and the watering
[1:28:17] comes from the preaching of the word I
[1:28:22] want to hear bigger even than that
[1:28:26] because if you want I could come back
[1:28:28] and teach you know I can rock back and
[1:28:33] teach teach or preach alright here we go
[1:28:38] I just teasin now watch there's a vast
[1:28:41] difference between a teacher and a
[1:28:45] preacher it is two different gifts of
[1:28:49] the Spirit altogether and as I humbly
[1:28:53] say this I have a gift of either he was
[1:28:57] a prophet he said no preacher I have no
[1:29:00] teacher but he he don't have the gift of
[1:29:02] either by two different gifts so do we
[1:29:05] get at church
[1:29:06] Mary's belief and I believe you notice
[1:29:08] one know Mary could have waited till she
[1:29:10] had some kind of sign
[1:29:11] that she was going to be mother and you
[1:29:14] could read after the meeting is over
[1:29:16] until you feel that you could move your
[1:29:18] crippled leg or a little better you
[1:29:20] could hear or that deaf air or cancer
[1:29:22] seemed to be it wasn't burn you so much
[1:29:24] that is not taking God at His Word to
[1:29:27] take God at His Word is the here's word
[1:29:30] accepted and stopped rejoicing in it
[1:29:34] your rejoice is evidence that you have
[1:29:38] to take one of this world because faith
[1:29:41] is the substance of what you open for
[1:29:43] it's the evidence of what you have not
[1:29:45] seen so once I receive it because the
[1:29:47] hallelujah tonkin Lord have a healing me
[1:29:49] tonight thank you for the literally
[1:29:51] risen night glory hallelujah I'm
[1:29:56] somebody next to you don't know why you

[1:31:40] Seas and so on and the can worship and
[1:31:42] John types the bride I'm John was
[1:31:46] weeping he was saved he was an
[1:31:49] atmosphere heavenly places and he was

[1:33:04] they were in the upper room praising and
[1:33:08] blessing God continually it was not
