our bibles to psalms chapter 22 one verse verse 28. we want to read malachi 4 verse 5 and 6. and we also want to read revelation 2 1-7 i want to thank you for coming to that power of prayer uh yesterday it was really a blessing to see all of you out and uh we're looking forward for the next one amen praise of god so we want to look at psalms 22 28 it says remove not the ancient landmark which thy fathers have said malachi 4 and six behold i will send you elijah the prophet before the coming of the great great and dreadfully of the lord and he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children on the heart of the children to their fathers beside common smiley earth with a curse and from revelation chapter 2 unto the angel of the church of ephesus right these things say that he that hold up the seven stars in his right hand who walk it in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks i know thy works thy labor like patience how that's though can't not dare them which are evil or these church folks you talk more here now and thou has tried them would see their apostles and are not and has found them liars and as born and as patients and for my name's sake has labored and has not fainted nevertheless i have somewhat against thee because that was left thy first love remember therefore from wednesday what fallen and repent and do the first works or else i will come unto thee quickly and will remove that candlestick out of his place except thou repent but this dog asks that thou hate us the deeds of the nicolaitans which i also hate he that had an ear let him hear what the spirit said unto the churches to him that overcome it will i give to eat of the tree of life which is in the midst of the paradise of god let's pray father we thank you for your word and hear your people lord needing revelation inspiration and power into their lives father may you come and speak life to me in jesus name we ask it amen god bless you may be seated praise god i have a title this morning returning to the ancient landmark that the fathers have set that's the title returning to the ancient landmark that the fathers have set and have an inspiration back to your first love o praise the name of the lord hallelujah back to your first love remember when you first came to the lord how sweet it was how precious this was you couldn't miss a service you have to read your bible you have to pray you're asking god for things and you've seen it coming you're asking off for protection you see asking god for blessings whatever you ask god as a child giving you this you're giving it this he he blessing you he's helping you a long life journey oh my hallelujah praise god god bless you brother samuel and this morning we want to announce that brother samuel rollins will make him yes home church could you stand by brother he said brother samuel roland god bless you amen praise god he came just a few seriously back and he came and see me sometime and tell me you know he was avoiding me he looking for home church and he just want to make sure he's the right place and whatever you got the confirmation i like that isaac tell him in kyle make sure god confirmed to you that this is the place to be because when they go and get hot it'll get rough you have to know if you're supposed to be here oh glory to god hallelujah praise god because we want people who are committed people that are dedicated praise god hallelujah so i told him i said my i'm saying i'm looking for god to send the right people among us hallelujah the right people because something about the break forth and we have to have the right people to pack the burden and to carry the weight of the word of promise hallelujah praise god hallelujah you know there are some people they only like to be around when the wheels already turning they're not part of the reasoning at all they're not part of the labor and the sweat and the prayers and the tears hallelujah praise god they want to get the throne and go go through the suffering and the pain but they admire that trone but they want to sit on it but you have to overcome the sit on it she not overcome it will sit with me on my throne hallelujah it have no free right you know kyrie wasn't free you know it was painful but he loved you so he he was hanging in there because of you hallelujah god loved constraining him to pay the price he knew you would fail he knew you would sin he knew you had backslide he knew you'd fall but he still loved you still he's still pushing push and pushing [Music] [Applause] so when people come we say welcome when people go we say bye-bye and no love lost and we have a certain way in this church with a streetcar nice but here come on you go so some people could go and they could come back because we didn't treat them bad that's just how we just do things people just get fights we just restore people too quickly you want them sitting in the mood as bench for years is either god forgive fear your sins or god i forgive you if god forgive you who are me who am i to hold your sins against you when jesus dropped your charges want a manipulator to control you i am not interested in that sorry i don't have the ability to do that i want to be controlled by the holy ghost i want the holy ghost move i want to be like how the bible said men of god move by the holy ghost i can have notes here i have 30 something pages here but i don't know where i'm going to today i have something upon my heart though praise god return to the ancient landmark that the fathers have set there was something about history and about grandfather and great grandfather and the fathers is there something about that hallelujah the old time ways the old pathways as brother solomon natina preached earliest night in ghana the old pathways there's something about that that is original no wonder why he goes in a prophet he said he shall turn the hearts of the children back to the faith of the fathers you can't go forward until you go back you have to pick up what the father's had become with the fathers as original how about young people want to do their own thing and they're not taking advice or counsel from the fathers they feel the father is old school well old school almost more wisdom than new school yeah mathematics and and engineering all kind of stuff but the fathers have the experience oh glory to god so god they're bringing something new he bringing back what the fathers had because fathers had the original word the original life the original power the original glory that's what the fathers have and we backfired from that but god said i will restore and the devil have to hear that and get nervous because god going to restore not only will god restore what is promised but he will restore you i'll hear you i am here yeah i am here there's a promise over your life a full restoration full full restoration [Applause] god's so good he said all that the kangaroo had left oh i will restore to you all where they eat though i'm going to bring it back i'm going to bring it back i'm going to bring it back you're going to get a bumper cup you're going to get doubled for your trouble oh glory to god don't get me started this morning hallelujah hallelujah get to miss tattered this morning glory [Applause] this is no time to say nobody knows the trouble i've seen they're not amazing that you know this he said no i'm not no i have not seen no heirs have heard the glory and this is time to quote the scripture my god the present suffering is not worthy to be compared with the glory that shall be revealed this is time to quote that [Applause] and if you're not in trouble now you're in trouble let me say it again if you're not in trouble you're in trouble you may be the devil leaving you alone something wrong maybe on the devil's side because when you see you're on god's side it's troubles his accidents his disaster his war is all kind of upset these things they can't even explain because the devil is mad because he have no chance of becoming a manifested son he missed himself up there oh gloria he was sunday morning all kind of music and everything else and he had a thought in his heart to be like the most high he wanted to play god hallelujah and he got a whole bunch of revolutionaries and boxes and spirits angels they wasn't falling here they wasn't falling yet they were part of the angelic host oh glory to god tried to overthrow whispering one one another to be like the most high and you get two tests of the angels praise god humber tells the angel to fight and michael fought in a dragon fought and if michael had a fight what about you praise god you mean you ever fight you want a priest the catholic church is up so this is different here this is the place where the kingdom is preached and every man press into it i am a man of the hour only man message man don't come with that you know not here and have that elsewhere don't come with that ear this is where the kingdom is preached and every man press say press press their way into earth there's a kingdom depression too [Applause] [Music] glory give the lord our prayers [Applause] you may see that your mother can't put you in it your father can't put you in your pasta father can't put you in it your elder father can put you in it your dicky father can put you in it your wife can't put you in your husband can put you in get serious there between a bed one sleeper and the next one sleep into that's what the bible tell me one will be sleeping and the other one will be left you sleep i go on oh give the lord a shout you better believe that you are leaving this place brother we have come here to be tribulation saints we are coming to clean glass another pity party because you missed the rapture that is not what we preaching all these years for we come your face to make it his wife had made us not ready we come here to be inspired we come here to be anointed oh glory to god you said he said you should listen to wednesday's service mission go back and listen to the wednesday night series oh hallelujah joshua rebuke how long some tribes how long are you slack to possess your promise hallelujah kind of foolish virgin anointing slack were you waiting for joshua to come and hang your land we're going to pick up dirt and bring for you that's alright one tribe go to the joshua and said he land too small he said well he said going cut like you're mounting up there you find your property too small you find your portion too small your joy too small you find everybody has more joy than you take joy who's stopping your joy nobody can take care or read your bible and pray every day your joy will grow your faith will grow your life will grow you're on the phone wasting time gossiping on your whatsapp you're on this you're under that william your joy must go double sucking it normal normal normal dry dry dry dry your life joined on hallelujah he said i know that works i know you could do this i know you could do that but one thing i have against you hallelujah left your first love so god want quality stuff god i want a big bunch of mules walking for the chat and working for the lord and there is no love behind that come on don't get me started inside of here you have to have love as the fire of god love as the motive of god love as the objective of god love has the unction the inspiration of god behind every move and action [Applause] i love god i love the word i love his people i love the cause that is why i will fight the way i fight him [Applause] that's why when you don't even look and you're looking miserable and you look at the press and whatever it is i didn't look at you i believe in god for you sometimes if i keep looking at you i will walk off the property and don't preach but because i know that there is something inside of you i know that's not how you always will be i know the potential that lays within you and i am here to activate to motivate to inspire to annoy don't really let you know who you are where you come from and where you're going you are not going to remain as you are all glory to god no no no no you are not going to remain as you are you're going to become what god attains to become oh hallelujah you'll be seated the labor for his name he said anything you can't do in jesus name leave it alone you can't take a drink in jesus name you can't play cards in jesus name you can't say smarty joke in jesus name you can't cuss in jesus name [Applause] subconsciously you don't want to say amen you know who you are whatever you do in the word or deed do all in the name of jesus christ hallelujah so jesus said i have something against you these are nice believers you know because they're making them apostles who say they are not sweat now this wasn't the pastors doing that channel ordinary believers you know what i stand up you're not saying what paul say paul said this that ordinary believers because then believers know the word challenging apostles mighty man of god oh yeah let me hear what that angel is saying because if that angel is saying what what what the prophets say that angel has to run you know hallelujah god will present a prophet to the generation for naught the prophet is not another preacher another exalter a kind of evangelist on a higher level that is not a prophet you know a prophet this prophet we're talking about here is one of the stars in the right hand of almighty god eduardo star and little steiner they don't have seven and a half you know if you only have one star in every age and all them seven stars in the right hand of god or give the lord a shout so when their men speak they're not speaking their thoughts they're speaking thus says the lord and we are resting on that we are resting on god says the lord we're not resting on our dream we're not wrestling our opinion we're not resting on your feeling we're not even resting on your prophecy because prophecies will fail but thus here the lord can fail he said you held my name i appreciate that i commend you for that i've seen your trident who see the apostles and so forth from their lives they don't cope with the word i appreciate all of that but there's something i got against you that is you left your first love but the bible says charity covers are much of their sins so when somebody running around exposing someone exposes one there's no charity that is you trying to say you better than that one because the pharisees say i am not like that man outside there he don't do this he do i ain't doing this and i doing this you know you know what i did lord you know between you and i how we just go down that man outside saying lord another word they're coming remember me do you say that man also more righteous than that one that man is it's close i am dumb you see my responsibility is so sharp but the man on the outside is more righteous so he sees a hot thing amen that's why god can say about man from my own heart jake god knows even when come the birthright jacob not compromising with us at all he's a trickster for everything else we see that he don't make joke with that that that that that is the baptism of the holy ghost that is me rolling on the floor that is me carrying on that's me staggering like a drunk man don't play with that i don't want to be too holy and to be churchy i want to be amen i want to be in the spirit like john was in the spirit i wanted people to move if the pressure could move on you can't move something wrong with you if the pressure could dance and you get down something wrong with you if the people could shout and you cash out something wrong with you because i'm leaving your shelter not even here dancing i live in your praising my god [Music] [Applause] the saints have to come back to the first love for the old-fashioned type meetings for the holy ghost type meetings not the no take and meet his holy ghost meeting you can always play back the tape and take all your notes home but when you come here you better come to worship i have been in convention when ministers don't want to worship and when people were saying god they're right and they're writing nothing don't need scribbling screaming because they don't want to stand up they don't want to pray that that is not our nail but they're beating the people to worship or give the lord a shout but we don't want to hear spirits in the water here boy spiritual water boy fire fire fire and a man saying put a little water here put the water away there's no real fire man the real fire man is go in the front you go in front with the fire hose facing the fire oh give the lord a shout oh glory to god i can't tell you to worship and i can't worship [Applause] i can't tell you the show can i cash out i can't tell if the praise god and i can't praise god i have to be able to praise and worship my god abraham built the altar jacob peter alter moses build the altar all them brothers pray all tests and give god praise not a sister altar give the lord a shout you bro you men of god inside out here open your mouth and give god blu-ray guru [Music] maybe he sees that that's one of the better speeches in ghana when abraham when abram was about to offer isaac and the lamb was there he called the priest yo vagiera it's not god's name if he call it and god approve it god approved his name as to go by tyra god approved the name as banner [Applause] all of them brought us back inspiration revealed the seven compound name of jehovah and god wrap it up in jesus christ he is our planner he's our healer he's our love he's our glory to god [Applause] jehovah of the old jesus of the new by revelation and inspiration when things happen the people are altered call up his peniel praise and wrestle with god oh glory to god then follow his name and things like adam's name and things god called adam to name the animals and whatever adam name was the name thereof i'm an adama discernment and you have to have a resentment that's been moving in a different cycle altogether he said when the power of this church rises not when the power go down oh give the lord a shout don't tell me no power come on now come on now not no power going down not power going down [Applause] let me see [Music] let's go this girl a person when i prayed god a long time all right now here we go he said no uh something against you you left your first love you left that love that you once had for them good old-fashioned holy ghost meetings this is what i want to have they were going standing over see on top that power our prayer gonna drop a faster somebody said if he had fast he wouldn't last oh yeah you know why we're going there we're going back to the landmarks that the fathers have said paul talk about fasting often all that is part of the landmarks i know the modern generation get away from that they don't know whether some of them know we're fasting again all right so you begin to kind of backside into that formal thing you know and people sit back and relax and they believe pastor bringing the bread and the manna and here i keep operating a big creepy any puppet and he's just pulling out bread doing giving out bread and i don't know bread listen i do have a message you know i preaching another man's message let me say it again i don't have a message enough god said behold i send you the entire world elijah the prophet and he will do something i like what he said that you see you have to translate that when he say he he gone but he is his message [Applause] that's the conversion the people just missed like we read something thinks wednesday night about ezekiel bone god brought ezekiel to the vagia dry bone and said can these bones live question that's a scary thing you bring our man a bunch of bones your bones are even connected together only bones like bonesville bones country and said can these bones live well is he smart he didn't fresh and just run his mouth and say ah he said don't know it i i i don't know but but you know then then because he can relax himself and say you know god tell them prophesy say unto these bones that you shall live i will cause bread to come into you watch bread community bones is the final product but it have a process to get the bread so when god said he shall turn the house of the children back to the faith of the fathers there's the process and how he will do that [Applause] so when god pronounced something over your life is the process to get to what is pronounced [Applause] it doesn't change what he has pronounced let me give an example god told samuel go to the house of jesse and anoint me a king he didn't say a boy he's a king god seen david mature on the throne god saw david kingship david is still a boy here qualified to settle not thrown yet but god he anointed him no he's anointed you have to go through the process to reach where the anointing has pleased him [Applause] so god can pronounce things over you but then there's a process to get there in between where you are and where you are to be here come satan lying to you everybody clear come on read back to me help me help me somebody where you are and where you want to be here come the devil talking to you because you're not there yet yet [Music] you reach there yet but you're on your way maybe he said that's that's what i do with what man saying because man didn't give the prophecy and i wouldn't let a man speak into my life who not authorize to speak in my life don't let nobody speak into your life or don't authorize to speak in their life they may speak the wrong thing into your life and you may happen to believe that person and that person could be a liar or god and a liar speaking their life and mess up your life you don't want that you want the right person to speak into your life and that right word must be it must be the word that woman in the world what everybody's telling see she's there she died they're talking about her she newspaper she's the talking whatsapp on facebook all kind of stuff like that but jesus was the one to speak into her life you say woman if you know who speak to you you will ask me for water to drink and the water i give you will spring up at the everlasting life she said give me of that water or give me get the lord i shout then jesus said he that believe it on me as the scripture had said out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water [Applause] so god always wanted it to be personal and internal oh glory to god let me say it again god always wanted to be personal and internal he never want no god to be an a man he wanted in his people oh give the lord i shout that man god was jesus word made flesh to multiply and bring other sons or give the lord a shout you are not normal people you are sons and daughters of the living god [Music] called to a higher order a higher life [Applause] if god had that against this church he got it against that one too because you left your first love i've got it against you i have something against you that's my complaint you once had a great time you let the world begin to creep in you've got to act in a little formal you're still holding my name you're still doing things that is right you got a lot of patience and so forth you labor like a mule just labor and work you left grace and faith and power and swap it for labor and works i tell you about the brandon i help every greater woman i can that's a good thing i commend you for that but where is the first love you once had david said restore unto me the smile i once had no respond to me the joy smile and joyous different things [Applause] you could smile in your heart heavy as lead but joy you can't hide your joy oh [Applause] god [Applause] ever see a man where do you love one from him somebody get a gift of a new car and an effects thanks again you ever see that somebody get razor

bible says you say wear them all night prayer beatings and tears on your cheeks tears on your cheeks when else you have it my goodness you see the bible even dusty and got cobwebs in it you read love stories and news and things the people who are more in tune with the news number the bible and the promises of god see and things that ought to even be allowed to be published put out for the trash can and we penetrate people pick them up and just left over them like a bunch of flies in a garbage can he said what we need is back to our first love back to pentecost and after ephesus where you see they lost their first love the next age is smoother and the words will not come from bitterness root of bitterness coming into them this church the main church the big part the majority of them was hammering against the holy ghost ruling in the church and they wanted to rule themselves they wanted to set up a priesthood they wanted to act like the old testament they wanted priests and how we classify ourselves we got our organization denominations standing in class and we got grandchildren it's that been took in by adoption so forth we don't have isn't this bad we don't have the whole line of pentecostals that used to die out and really come true with god that genuine faith so in those old days it wasn't come to church and baptize another saint ain't the saint yet until that same prayer true and breakthrough and we're not talking about doing casual prayer where you're listening to your own prayer and you're listening to how you're praying to god not that the prayer coming from your heart sign talking about them polish praying oh and you know you're quoting all these things god wanted here and that do you want god to hear you you know but i had talking and i'm outgoing today god can come along and escape that you know you say you you had too much teaching looking for new light that's the problem in yesterday people are too much are teaching and they're looking for what teachers they know the bible said they would be having itching ears because he prays hard die not his heart yes getting in the spirit that's hard listening to teachers and teaching that's easy as long as you have a man of the hour bringing some teaching or whatever easy listen to him if he falls god help you but when you understand this word is to become activated in your life hold it hold it and the man or the teacher can activate it to you then your faith comes a little different because you ain't coming just to hear a man you're coming for the spirit to activate the way that the man is preaching you want that to come alive in your spirit in your heart and your soul so you ain't comfort letter you come for a reality [Applause] so i'm gonna skip and skip a lot of stuff so it had left his first love leaving his first love of the word of god was revealed to us as having fallen from his origin which was pentecost in plain english that means this church was in danger of being taken away from the leading of the holy spirit the control of the spirit this was exactly what took place after moses that israel of egypt the way of god is to lead them by the cloud of fire prophetic utterance miracles and signs god-given wonders this was to be accomplished by god selected god ordained god equipped god sent men with the whole camp being dominated by a holy ghost move they rebelled they wanted a set of rules and preached to go by it become like these people who don't have self-discipline don't have inner discipline they like the pastors who could pick you whip on them because they need licks to come into line so they'll lead the kind of man that could put licks on them and then they shake them and then they had to come back from all its it's almost like they're looking for abuse there's some people somehow they have a kind of sadistic thing about being abused but when you're motivated by love you can't wait to come to church you can't wait to pray in other words because of the love for god you're serving god now because your father dragged you inside of here you're serving god because you love god if you're father backslide you are not going to backslide if your white backside you're not gonna backslide if your husband backs that you're not gonna backslide because of your love for god is that a man called you is god call you is that man your servant is god you're serving [Applause] you're not serving god because of the preacher just because of god because of what he has done for [Applause] you now i believe in leadership but it's not what what what but isn't but it's not the relationship of men i believe in i believe in the leadership of the holy ghost coming through the word i believe also that god has set men in the church who men who are gifted by the spirit and they will keep the church in order i believe also that the church is ruled over by men that god sends to take charge but that rule is by the word so that is not men really ruling but is the spirit of god for the word and spirit is one that is why i bring the quote quote unto the quote this is hard you know i could press play and play a tip for you on one message what am i starting to do i must stick up how many different messages i have to where i get this culture because it's not one message not one book so i have to hunt for these things i can't tell nobody hunt for me i ain't looking like them cruel certainly post waiting for accidents that happen to each other you know you have them just waiting on the post looking to see an accident gonna happen with some church they're gonna pick up some dead bird i nothing that you know we fly in a long time flying to get we won't meet oh glory to god brother isaac was the preacher this morning he felt ill he had the flu and so on that's how i end up preaching but he was the preacher this morning so ika what was you press play how to find meat fresh killed crackers blood dripping blood has to be dripping when you put your beacon you have to rip that meat there and how to feed your spirit how to feed your soul has to do something for your life like freshly killed tacos oh glory to god you love him remember them which i've ruled over you who have spoken unto you the word of god whose fate follow considering the end of their conversation and that is life but see what is happening back here that false vine was getting a hold i was teaching that rulership by man was right so they could quote that scripture right it taught the pete the church had to be governed it taught a control over the people but instead of doing it god's way they simply took authority invested all the spiritual power in their own hands and came out with a holy priesthood standing between god and the people and they went right back to the old ironic system and i god said you have one thing that i hate the deeds of the niculator because anytime you put a man like mary or put a man between you and go that trouble it has to be you seeing that you have direct access it has to be you seeing that when you come to service every service are getting a password and a username username is you the password is the word and it's giving you the authority which is faith to approach god and pull down any blessing [Applause] so you kind of get unauthorized injury you are authorized by the blood of jesus by a new unliving way to enter into the holiest of holies no angels until you stop you can't go you're your son he died once all glory to god and perfected forever then that are sanctified so his blood made a way hallelujah glory to god it's not about you it's about him it's not your sacrifice it's his sacrifice oh give the lord some praise do you see it do you see how that gives you access to every redemptive blessing oh glory to god let's continue jesus wants fellowship that's what god's heart longs for tonight he longs for it in dallas and every place in the world a breaking down of prejudice a cleansing from the pulpit all the way to the basement an old-fashioned revival that will shake denominations together and will fill the real church of the living god shake hands with the holiness the baptist the methodist the pentecostal the nazarene he longs to get into our fellowship to his people he come to come to commune and to bring you something good but the church and the people keeps him away well that group don't believe just like i do what difference does that make that has nothing to do with it and that's why people go on with the profession of the doctrine it's almost apostle creation it's catholic i believe this i believe that i believe that and your life terrible well let your life con leave something now don't tell me where you believe just just treat me nice [Music] people pastors straight they can't shake your hand because they believe you believe different is that right like that jesus in you passing me straight amen you're going to fight with me you see he said we need a breaking down a cleaning up a house cleaning a real revival to start when the gifts and the powers and the manifestation of the holy spirit can come into the church showing great signs and wonders how can god do it upon a divided group we can't do it god loves his people we must all come together grace mass meeting and forget being practiced and presbyterian and so forth you tell me the churches god got around the holy ghost they could gather wrong with the holy ghost they don't want to get around the holy ghost they want to gather wrong teachings i have a bomb to drop for you hallelujah glory you say he knocks on the door of every mortal that's his duty he is here for no one gets passed by all of them is invited halt blind every church here methodist baptist pentecostal nazarene

shout do you believe that we have to make the papers oh give the lord some praises people i'm not afraid of the papers at all we gonna make news you think god's gonna lift the veil over that pride and don't identify publicly who she is there'll be one more ride he said i'll ride this trail once more you may be seated it will cause something to happen take place that headlines will come into the paper television will cast it around the world when christ come into thousands of homes that's what these meetings are for that's the idea of these ministers sitting on the platform that's my purpose of being here is to try to tell you that christ loves his people and we must get together for the moon of the holy spirit and the rapture of the church seven thunder's going to gather the bride together you can't take that out [Music] there's going to be a great gathering brother hungary no devil i'm going to stop it you may be seated whatever i'm talking about some farmers have some ducks and there's some big walls around them ducks and then god sent me rain and they were making the fall and the water began to rise higher and higher and higher and the water rise so high it went over the walls and ducks swim over here and ducks swim over there and ducks at our fellowship what we need is a rain rain that is what this neighbor says it rain a bunch of holy ghost rain okay out the bishops they go sit down the popes oh give the lord some praises hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah glory to god yeah the obama want to hit you right now he said no watch that group don't believe just

anybody said amen they're questioning i want to get this here this is this is beautiful we will never see eye to eye until we see him face to face and be changed on men in his own glorious body that dead every eye to eye foolishness we will never see eye to eye but we can work together for the kingdom of god and for the glory of god and for the saints of the living god oh give the lord some praises thank you luke right from a certain all those brothers were different the reports are connected but from different viewpoints that's what god we have served they have something called mangoes but mango is not one it have so much different types of mango it has something called watermelon it only has one type it have all kind of watermelon it has believers is that one type [Applause] when nobody is saying anything peter say lord if that is you beat me come not a man move all them disciples who didn't think they may walk they may even talk people say that you made me to come jesus said come he just had to walk you sink no you can go and make a poem over of business thinking you can write a song about people thinking he's still saying that you will become [Music] now the way i am i like that kind of guy [Applause] peter like adventure peter will step out i like not but not everybody's sure matthew is a different dude philip is a different kind of guy all of them have different characteristics john's sticking close to close to jesus and jesus said what is this eve you know charitably come and they're going by their own interpretation of how john and hold jesus love john and john have to reveal the book of revelation and john's second well close to jesus so you can't jealous anybody and look at anybody you have to love being who you are [Music] guys right here we have no impersonation go to some churches in the past say see all them many meaning one just like the pastor deep as well so all i'm hand as what doing that say oh lord i'm saying they're not getting holy ghosts they're getting not man's spirit that troubled me for years you know are you the trouble with that is a man doing so everybody still doing so they're born saying nobody's seeing this so much but that's not here you know i ain't seen nobody being like me is the holy ghost spirit of god you gotta copy me you gotta follow me praise god you have to be the word oh pray say love that quote do we not see eye to eye until the other side but we could work together let our differences be our strength you know what i said let our differences be our strength not our to separate brotherhood and so on like that hallelujah praise god amen let's continue now now moses he was born with these great gifts and and quality within him then it only takes something to flash across to bring that thing to life the seed of god is actually placed in us from the foundation of the world so you are not now being recognized by god god puts something in you and what in you is what responds to the gospel most times we can't even explain how we come to the lord if something move upon us something something pull us we can't explain that something regardless if you're halfway a quarter way or no way a boxing that doesn't change that's something inside of you it's still there i've taught many times woman of the world her condition though she was ill-famed life was degraded she was in that condition because that traditions had never touched her and though when that life was struck her she recognized it and there was something there to respond and moses was a born a prophet he was raised in an intellectual school pharaoh's fears paris palace and so on moses being born with his great gift of faith then he was anointed and commissioned at the brilliant bush to deliver god's people you see what great qualities this man had he was born for a certain thing and god had a purpose in it and god got the purpose of you being here if you can only get to that place how much trouble you see of god and yourself too so stop talking why me and why me and why me stop that that's that's just foolishness i'll save you a whole lot of trouble there right now so stop that stop that why me and why are you in this and how this happened to me stop that why aren't this condition stop that that is foolishness god life have a purpose behind it tell the devil stop it tell the devil don't bring back ever bring back that you again you're gonna get the will of god and the mind of god for why you are where you are how you are right now if god wanted me to be 16 years old now he could have been born long long after where i was born but god wanted me in the age i mean right now i can't want to go back young like a 16 years old i'm not 16 years old i passed that hallelujah i'm heading down this way hallelujah the devil wants to send me in the wrong direction i go in this way if i keep going this way i'll come back that way because this way you bring him back to young again see i think i'm gonna go back y'all i do this and i do this and i'm wearing fancy clothes and trying to like look young again and what no i'm not trying to do that i'm going this way in the 60s go 70 80 90. who knows i'm gonna make a hundred i don't know do you have to come between a hopefully rapture and gone when i come back 18 19 years old so i am not an old man praise god i still young praise god i'm going back to you seeing grey here i see him black here oh hallelujah praise god oh glory to god i'll miss emptied every tea could come back gonna have to eat oh glory to god no dentist repairing nothing on the other side there'll be no dentist there there have been no doctor there there have been no food repair hand repair never repaired kidney repair there be no doctors over there trying to repair you across there the lamb will be the light oh glory to god you're gonna sit down with your eat we have our we are a grand thyme oh give the lord some praises this gospel is real this gospel is original we're not preaching fairy tale you may be seated glory to god let's continue moses born what notice the sea laying deer with an intellectual conception this is the message world right now see with all faith he was born to deliver his people it's inside now faith is the victory that overcomes the world and that seed is the new to overcome everything that you have to overcome yet let me say it again the faith is already in you to overcome everything you have not overcome yet what has to happen let's continue let's let's let's do the word watch so noses uh the sea leaned here and when you when i'm preaching this you have to see yourself all right uh with an intellectual conception with all faith all with all the faith he was born to deliver his people and yet here we go it never come to life until that light from the burning bush flushed across it until he's seen not something he read about aha so they're not reading a book now there's not reading spoken books no this is beyond reading now this is coming into a reality that you know is god no man can give you that no man can preach do that you've got to encounter that oh give the lord a shout out [Music] hallelujah what not something he read about but something he's seen with his eyes something that spoke to him and he spoke back to it and that bring the thing to life and i think a woman boy or girl i think in an intellectual conception of what they think the word is and so forth can never have a full foundation stand until they have met that light that brings that word to a reality i want that to be a burden upon your heart that you want that word to become a reality you know it is right you know it is true you know it is god speak it you know the prophet spoke it but you want beyond that you want the reality of it hallelujah shout out reality amen praise god so moses knows intellectually the seed that was born in him was laying in his heart watch and he tried she was intellectual experience with the word like that his intellectual so there's a next there's an intellectual experience you could have with the word this is big to bring them out to deliver them knowing he was born for that purpose he know that time the scriptures said it and so on and hear the prophet breaking you know we are coming to the rapture we have lived the time out at the time of the rapture is at hand we are looking for rapture and faith that can pull the church together and give it some supernatural strength that can change these bodies that we live in and we see a god that can raise the dead off the floor or out of the yard and bring him back to life again and present him before us when we see a god that can take a cancer that eat a manta shadow and raise him up on strong healthy man that ought to give rapture and fate to the people now let me drop a bomb on you he said rapture and faith is leaning a message but when you're translating that it has to have a manifestation of the dead being raised up of a cancer case being corrected and that will give rapture and faith to the people because the rapture is a glorified divine healing the rapture is your body being changed in a moment of trick of an eye and you having the faith that your body could be changed and when you see god to take a man from cancer death and pull him back to life you could know god to change your body when you could see god to change humor and kidney trouble and diabetes and reverse back height blood pressure whatever it is you could know god could change you transform you [Applause] so watch rapture in faith leading the message but that's not just an intellectual quote to preach that not letter word let's continue oh my hallelujah so it's not just wrapped in faith missing so wrapped in faith lay in the message that's the word part of it the word part that's the latter part the man being raised from the floor dead man that's the manifestation path you need boot word and spirit come on give the lord a shout out some people have the knowledge of the word but they have no manifestation that brings the word to life you have to want it you have to thirst for it you're not changing from my word it's your simple life [Applause] let's continue could we take some more now watch here moses based on his great call upon the word it was great this is big moses base is called upon the word until one day he met this light and the very word itself spoke back to him then he got his anointing that anointed what he had in him that was on the inside i'm still reading so all this faith was on the inside what's the secret the word is in the bright is that's the secret it's not outside that right it's in the bride well that word in you has to be anointed how could it be anointed when dynamics is the anointing for the word and the bride he said no other life could work in her so something because an anointing can anoint you it will take dynamics itself that is what we're preaching for you shall receive power when after the holy ghost [Music] now if i don't preach this how you will expect it how do i look for it if i don't preach this what you'll be looking for you have to know what you're looking for as a true believer you have to know what you're looking for you're looking for your portion you might be the seated is not complicated or not joshua had three things to do take them over conquer the land and divide the land it's not no mathematics and rocket science three things take the people over you can't divide away not conquered everybody in london your city are yours that you're yourself things i'm going to lick you up say i just show them who's the boss you have to show them that this is your land and you have to kick them out i'll use the wording bible call it drive them out that devil moving show so you have to get the authority to drive them out say satan not in my house not upon my son not upon my daughter i'm taking that i had it for years but after this service today i take an authority in my house and i pray in the blood of jesus come on come on now come on now come on now when do you try to make claims like that it will be recognized in them that's not the prayer requesting there's a claim i claim a husband that recording in heaven you know and then he's had to pray god's had to follow your vial up this is maryland prayer and god said to philip this is paul in prayer and god had to fill it up [Applause] this is shame prayer and god said to philip what's up to fill up your prayer vile i said the prayer goes on the full of your prayer full of your prayer fill up your prayer oh glory to god when the vile fall you start to pour it out speaking to answer your prayers angels dump all what you're asking for or what you're longing for oh give the lord i shall even never shout before shout out as i say already if your pipe dripping home and it dripping slowly yeah fix it they're still dripping that's not a problem it dripping if you're sleeping nearby your body right about here drip dripping like torture but you see if your home get fire started and they say there's a fire you see there's a fire one eye open all the eye open you have that tire come from work and tired and the water dripping there but everything but if you hear fire all that tiredness just disappear you know [Music] that that don't even come into the picture all of a sudden you get a super strength because fire will burn on your house and you're not in this house burning down business and god will restore in your house you're not in that so you're looking to deal with that one time well there are certain things you have to deal with one time because that devil will burn [Applause] are we preaching to anybody here this [Applause] morning if we're looking for apostolic blessings we have to expect apostolic conditions come on now come on now preach back to me if we are looking for an apostolic church they're gonna have a personal condition but the church have to be ready before they put licks and peter in them they had an uproar experience you might be seated when the holy ghost came out in the upper room the devil thought that they were just excited and overexcited because he was not dear he didn't feel the pillar of fire he didn't see the pillar of fire he wasn't invited in the upper room he had had no clue as far as he concerned the junk they drifting but i'm talking about them demons come back and say they're having a time inside they get there forget it that's really exciting jesus is dead and gone they get them happy happy birthday special singing saturday i'm a nice inspiration because people imagine like inspiration i just sing like this sing sing sing why you don't like a good permission why did you come together and say we have a good hole he goes three days are praying fast and how do people come together and gather to pray and see if god rock trained with this glorious divine message sent by the prophet malachi 4. why we have a call for that no nobody's singing well that was so they sing they worship they come out standing up a room say let's finish then peter go on till they get quite beautiful and you see the man begging there and peter is a giver is that how it keeps spiritual for you when you're stingy and mean to keep money spirits off of you you have to give see people who don't want to give that's problem you have to be able to give so peter put his hand down to give i wouldn't recognize you and don't he don't have and you can't have where you don't you can't give what you don't have some people the more they get the most energy they get they get greedy because they find that they have to they want to give so they get tighter and they get tighter peter put his hands he says the same thing i don't have none but you know what i have something [Applause] something happened to me in the upper room [Applause] i am not the same peter that denied jesus i'm not the same man you seen the same outside man right you know i deny him right but what i have you don't have what i have i could give what i have empowered to give what i'll have i am anointed to give rise up and walk in the name of jesus christ [Applause] [Music] listen that must have a leap and jump don't come the newspaper don't call me television cameras they're taking pictures they're printing it now it's news the whole are jews when i'm shook up because here is somebody and everybody knew was crippled he is walking and jesus not are wrong [Music] last time he heard about that jesus was doing this thing but here come a here come a son [Applause] [Music] jesus was a child of that day and they returned to the faith that jesus had here come that faith manifested we are on this side and we are turning back to the faith that the fighters had [Music] you mean that same thing going to happen right over yes are you expecting it yes you expecting people to lie downstairs coming up the church to be prayed for yes you are expecting cripples to walk yes blind to see yes got to be raised up yes i am preaching my expectation [Music] wait no you expect miracles yes you may be seated where is the miracles i mean miracles you know i mean the same god has been walking to wine you know one minute wine run out the next minute you have wine next minute you leave the best wine for last that's a miracle go give the lord a shout miracle miracle miracle oh glory to god hallelujah my god a miracle in your life a miracle is coming to you today oh glory to god a miracle is coming to you today oh glory to god a miracle coming to you today [Applause] wherever god is there are miracles where the god is never signs whether god is there is wonders oh glory to god hallelujah praise god thank you lord jesus so we cannot expect god to come down to our level of thinking whoa we cannot bring god bring don't go to our level of thinking we gotta rise ourselves to his level of thinking and meet him on the grounds that he provided for us oh glory to god so the scribes and pharisees the hats they had their creeds they had their dogmas they had their robes the long beard the long gong and the tall hats and they were the representative of christianity or the law of that day because of the looks and the appearance and the dressing and song people respected them jesus had no long hacked had not looking nothing like them he was outside the system altogether and he busted them no listeners what about he said they had their creeds pharisees said you see herodians what more all different forms and sexy religion each one had did his that he didn't believe in resurrection no angel or spirit the other one believe in both resurrection angel and spirit one believe a certain way you wash your hands the other way do it in the day christ could could come in sort of a thing like that but when he comes in his power of his transaction christ that is to make this a part to make people live and act and behave themselves and to change their attitudes and to change their ways and to change their living they don't want nothing to do with that [Music] they want teachings they want doctrines they don't want something to influence their behavior and their life i hear enough even on that and this is still the word whether you say amen or not this is still the truth that's why people are comfortable to confess what they believe they feel proud so what they want to live just like they want to live they want to continue right on living the way they lived and yet be very religious and go to church and be a member thereof they can go on a sunday morning whatever time it is a 15-minute sermon walk with the pastor and walk away from there kind of have settles and go back to live the way yesterday thy church okay

what a church is [Applause] so when somebody talking about moreover the church than about the word about god you know the oath because jesus had come to bring what church is he can't represent what god is not what church is but what god is jesus came that he might present god to man and man didn't want it and the holy spirit today likes the manner to present god to man but the man wants to go to

go by the way of the cutters another carter girl how much bone she was living 40 pounds or much pongs or just bones and when his prince prefers she stood them bones gave that bed and run and touch the grass something just bones just bones run over there my glock would but am i scripting for that can these bones live oh god bones could run bone could come together it'd have to have a noise though oh glory to god people don't want no noise they're so quiet in this mess i sorry for them and they claim to see the name on watchbook which book some copy book they see the same name or what book that john saw when john saw his name so don't say all in heaven all the greatest thing you could get the greatest revelation outside the revelation of jesus christ the greatest revelation you could get is your name is on that book when you know your name no preacher could rub it off no deacon no elder no trusty not church if you leave the church your name on the book hallelujah if you leave this country your name is still in the book if you hide in hell yes damn still in the book oh give the lord i shout once you get a revelation of your name on that book that's it [Applause] i don't know how i'm going to get to reach where i want to reach oh glory to god let's continue now the holy spirit will not misbehave itself in one person and behave itself in another so if one person misbehaved another person behaving that one person whom is behaving i don't care what they're teaching or they're preaching or what they're saying it's not the holy ghost and vote listen to how the prophet brought here it will make each person come into its character because it's a spirit that leads you it brings or makes you subject to its nature you don't bring it subject to its nature like a brother say bye tell your sister wait to the government i will deal with you see he work in the spirit so now when you go by the people no like god i rebuke my sister must take that that is not what you're talking about here amen just because brother branham had was to be tested with power now look at it but the punch god can't give me power because the behavior is so terrible they will cause a lot of trouble and confusion they will make a bunch of mess that's why he have to wait for character here it is brother branham had power and god had to test him with the power i don't want to get away no because god wanted to give him further so the people come making love in church and he said god drop dog and save you say blind if i said death whatever whatever you say you'll be done and he said i forgive you with power to do debt with power to say what a blind he said i forgive you because he knew himself he saw himself he was authentic he was real he wasn't mechanical he was an intellectual he was for real and we have to become authentic real not mechanical original this is me i forgive you and the holy spirit poured out because the holy spirit was pleased he said the right thing oh hallelujah later on god told him by voice tongues and interpretation because thou has chosen this narrow path you have walked in your own chosen you have picked the precise and correct decision it is my way it's the harder way but he picked it he said you walked in your own chosen i didn't force you you choose to walk this christian path where you choose the bloody footprints on the sons of time you choose that hallelujah so much it will bring you into its nature you don't bring it subject to your nature it makes you subject its nature the holy spirit makes you live and love to do it how you love to give up the things of the world when the holy spirit comes in how it cleanses you and washes you and put a desire in you to follow him a thirst and a hunger for more of it just baiting yourself he brings realities who does that the holy spirit brings realities brother branham said though in the early church they they they had so much of the holy ghost and every opportunity they're asking us for more more more when they beat them they come and say oh god strictness and give us more and they get that double portion they refill by the holy ghost you see this age hardly have it and they're not even asking for it but that early church their fathers and them oh they're only asking for more more holy ghosts more holy ghosts more power more love more witness and power oh glory to god hallelujah praise god we believe it hallelujah when god placed men here in the days of the lord jesus he gave men a true road map to power to his power a road map is something that tells you where you are headed if you want to go and that's the way god wants us to know he's talking about he from california i've missed the time he could know where to go california and only driving time back and forth he said that's the way god wanted us to know his word we know it we have traveled it we have tested it we have tried it you know where it leads to now his road map is his bible the map is what there's not google map or apple map this is the bible's map this is a map to lead you to power oh glory to god the bible is the road map that leads to the power of god faith leads you to the power so seven tennessee faith to do what to lead you to the power and power produces the promise he said we need power so watch the world gives faith right and faith lock the bottom there and write on top of it is what virtue and virtue is power that is what left jesus right so the first thing god gives you the revelation to give you faith and you expect with your faith now you move to god's power hallelujah and with power you could add the rest of your life because all these things are supernatural how many knows this is not natural you can make out buy a rainbow color cloth undressing it that is not a perimeter inside of you that's the dress you're wearing so this is not that rainbow cloth you're going on a new feast and buy this some color cloth and make up a rainbow dress that's not working what you need is this inside of you it starts with faith faith is a revelation but you have to get power isn't that right power need promise so okay now listen all right here's what ram says now christ the bishop got revealed the christ in you makes him the center of the revelation christ's life in you makes him the center of the revelation christ in the bible makes the bible the complete revelation of christ christ in you makes you the complete revelation the whole thing sees what god's trying to do what is the new book then you say well brother branham what's the new book it is the revelation of jesus christ personally to you now this is the word the new book is the revelation of jesus christ personally to you but that's not all next quote the new birth is an experience it's a gift of god it's the seal of your faith so if i preach new word is a revelation it's a revelation it's a revelation and don't tell you it's also an experience you're stuck with revelation and you have no expectation for the experience the right question must be asked if you're saying revelation and experience the question is which one come first then revelation comes first and experience after boat is the truth the new boot is a revelation and a new build is an experience and you come right down the middle and you take both of them oh glory to god you don't let nobody talk you out of experience hallelujah glory to god what you want is the revelation and the experience [Applause] because faith is the substance of what you're hoping for you have not yet experienced it in reality but you have it by faith oh give the lord a shout abraham had a revelation of isaac but he never saw isaac for 25 years he hung in there with his revelation he couldn't even show his wife the revelation he could talk it but he can show it it was inside of him and when it's revealed to you it is yours oh give the lord a shout when it's revealed to you it is yours isaac wasn't abraham abraham knew it by revelation because god spoke to him oh glory to god and that's what happened with peter when jesus said who do men say i am some say you're this i'm see you that he said who do you say i am he said what the christ then jesus said flesh and blood heart not reveal this unto you but my father oh glory to god that come from heaven then i come from texas a minister that comes from heaven and upon this rock i will build my church and the kids of hell will never prevail against it so we are in a triumphant church this morning the church of the ransom first born the glory of god hallelujah because it's built upon the faith my god glory hallelujah to god in many many many men my my my lord oh lord jesus hallelujah give him some praises people hallelujah [Music] glory in natural realm with his pg he had intellectual faith he didn't have divine faith there's a quite a difference in me having an intellectual feet than a divine feet my baptist friends failed to go on he said you get the intellectual fear by that but it must be a divine revelation of jesus christ to you and that just come out of the heart the intellectual faith is not enough good enough that's all right it only brings you but it only brings you to the holy spirit the holy spirit is a personal experience of built a new birth regeneration making a new creature in christ oh hallelujah praise be to jesus he said pentecost is an experience not an organization we experience pentecost by the new birth now when you talk about penny when you talk about sunderland people say pentecostal in this message they have no sign no wonder they don't want to preach about it too i can't join them if they don't have faith in that one is that is them are you faithful are you ready for the power of god i'm looking for the power every single service i'm under expectation for the power of god to come into the church that the minister came and sent the minister i will god fly me up flat flap me out here are you on your own oh glory to god hallelujah if you think i'm not looking for my portion i like my portion oh glory to god you think i'm not looking at my oh you think i know my portion after they cross over the land and they fight and they settle down and they come joshua comes to one thing like that kill him kill everyone and say george now joshua you you know the word moses spoke about me can i be playing shy and bashful and say look at who asking for something he said no jeff give me my mountain i ain't know about nobody else give me my mountain i know that trees giants on top of there but if the lord be with me them fellas sharp i shall be able to drive them out i can deal with that i could deal with that is my land i could deal with anything that come on my land my territory when you begin to understand your territory no devil is supposed to be on your [Applause] this body is your land too you have a right to say don't demon get out [Music] that's your right to [Applause] pentecost in an experience not an organization we experience pentecost by the new birth pentecost an experience that that a methodist can have baptist catholic whosoever will can have a pentecostal experience oh glory to god why and say god was god word were unfolding we must unfold as the word of god unfolds as times unfolds at signs unfolds he said we are living in the last days we're living in a time that god's great beautiful church ought to be standing on his feet shining like the leader of the valley well we are back there i belong to presbyterian and methodists and pentacles around this that what are this grace we should be unfolding god's spirit pouring out not just one little gosher not one baptism baptism after baptism not a revelation or what revelation after revelation power after power glory after glory we ought to be this way up the road ready for translation so as we go forward we're supposed to be unfolding revelation upon revelation power upon power glory upon glory where are we going to the translation [Applause] we're not going backward friends hallelujah oh glory to god thank you lord hallelujah i'm still in the first one i think it was a second dominion i'm good so i could spend two three hours here so buckling inside of there but one day i will run along the line you know hallelujah i know anything playing anything no i'll run it down the line you know all right let's continue here now the purpose of sending the holy ghost was for god to continue to a bunch of people to continually manifest god to the world that is not all not by a creed not by denomination but by the power of his resurrection by making his word real come on now that is the purpose [Applause] of sending the holy ghost do you see it now make it worth real by taking his promise how are you doing that by taking his promise and standing on the side of the minority which is where we are now and believe in god and watch the black skies move back and the power of god move in and take over so we define systems we define conditions we define we saying everything outside is a lie we said this word is true there's going to be a super church there's going to be a super race there's going to be a power coming to the church and now coming in that the people will be anointed that they're going to speak the word we're on our way to the rapture oh glory to god hallelujah so watch through the blood cell of jesus came forth the holy ghost that had itself bound up in the body called jesus that blood sanctified away by faith to call the redeem or the elected of god and when the holy spirit has taken all the meanness out of you he moves right in god himself to work his will now your how your meanest you have your attitude and behavior god are living with that you know god coming with some dynamite and some grenades and ripping it off and blowing inside the deer blowing up your heart with fire and the snake that inside your heart that burning out too and then the atmosphere is right for him to step in and sit on your throne oh chloe [Music] [Applause] glory hallelujah so then you have jesus in your heart and that is what a nice sapphire did not underhand understand you may be seated that cuss but peter got firebombed and his his demon his his snake got blown out and christ was always sitting in peter's heart so when they lie in church he said he lied to me you liked the holy ghost they failed to understand the holy ghost is operating in that man if you want to go back to his man force and feel like that is your business but you'll be judged because god they have no lion coming inside the church he'll have a glorious church without support or wrinkle that's the purpose of sending this message to have the right kind of church that the devil can't deceive because this bribe will not be like eve this pride could be a different bite altogether this probably your word bright this bride will be behind the world she will be the word the spirit will come upon that bride because the bible be the word the spirit has to come upon you because you are the word you will become the word the living word or glory of god hallelujah hallelujah you have to be listen listen the word manifested to be the bride not some church joiner no you will never hear me preach stay here and you'll be right by the rapture can't preach that stay with your pastor you're the intelligent

supernatural thing you know this happened before moses says stand back and rock back and just wait and watch and watch a snake eat up the other two turn back into the stick seriously all right all right if you say i can't understand no one but all right and that was an introduction to the wrongs that was just an intro and when moses finished with himself he said take your people take your flock take and go just just code let's go please pray for me just go and brother branham said you could live such a life that the devil don't know what to do with you devil's fed up you're just punishing

start from the bible a lot of people know what brother branham said but they don't know what the bible say but brother branham came to review what the bible say because this book was sealed says daniel say go die with daniel the book is sealed till the time of the end so the revelation of the seven seals was to reveal the bible so we have the authority to go back to the bible back to the word back to the landmark that the fathers have set on the day of pentecost they set it a certain way are we going back to that they had prayer they had fasting that crying that sign they had prayer meeting they had all things in common nobody was content among them oh glory to god had everything come and everybody had a portion everybody was surviving and living oh glory to god halal god added to the church such as would be saved the church had power steve my deacon had power power was in the church power to raise the dead power the castle devils but what the heel is sick it was no dead church it was no dry service it was no dry church it was a powerful church a church that god was proud of and once more god gonna get back a church that he's gonna be proud of hallelujah a church

be upon you he said you shall be witnesses unto me who is me the head soul the capstone the love jesus christ you shall be witnesses god bless anyone who will go back to the old landmark of the bible and start from the bible not according to theology not some man-made theology but the true bible theology start from the old landmark and move up and god will move with you and i know if we in this church start with the old landmark that the fathers have set goal going to move with us i will never leave you to forsake you the lord himself [Applause] went everywhere with them what's the proof what's the proof confirming the word do i shout the news let israel give a show this is not we trying nothing is that we trying something the lord himself [Applause] went everywhere with them [Applause] let me see then all right david say why why did he rage and the people imagine the fainting they say where is your god where is your god what god you say where is your god we're going to prove that god hallelujah the god of malachi for lives he said behold i send you elijah the prophet and he shall turn the hearts of the children back to the faith of the fathers we're going to prove the faith of the fathers has been restored that's the only way we could prove and confirm malachi fought in this world right now by going back to the faith of the fathers and picking up what they had [Music] no man can come now and explain to me this message i go run him hallelujah there's nothing in this world he could come and explain me that he's supposed to what i don't know what i want is the promise what i want in this power to produce the promise the promise is the holy ghost the promises that come upon you the fires to come upon the bride oh glory to god hallelujah so i'm looking for when the press come down look for the press so i'm looking for the right hundred percent group without power you'll be killed but my bible tell me you shall receive power after the holy ghost comes upon you and faith was given to pull down the holy ghost the same holy ghost that was bombed by the rule euphrates is to be loosed by the even time message to bring back god among the people because the word was invisible until the world became flesh and they confirmed the word become flesh omnipotence must speak and to confirm omnipotence being spoken the miraculous must take place do i shout in the house you can't tell me god is speaking and there is no miraculous because my omnipotent speak [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] and the first thing you know he began to prosper him and he built up garrison so that all these uncircumcised could not come in that's what the church needs today is a garrison of the old-time apostle teaching so this lukewarm formal in and out up and down doesn't get into our church one time i was wondering if they take anybody let me get a testimony in the early years i had no interest whatsoever in anybody from any church any group in this message because the behaviors were so horrible the ministers was teaching some crazy stuff and manipulating and controlling people's lives that i pledged to god i wouldn't do that i made a pledge to god and to this day i kept that pledge so we went on the fields and miara different places i still go preachers sinners and win them to the lord i didn't want nothing to do with them people out there that was my heart i remember a time in the arrow preaching and on the house and nobody would come i tell the lord if nobody come next service i cancelled him out and my friend brought a kangaroo next to us so i cancelled because nobody came my friend barkangli say um he said um oh you could do that that's what i told you lord that i fired six months later the holy spirit go back now and i went back and with baptism after baptism and there's amazing the hall will use you could walk from here the beach right down there he was taking them from here baptizing them walking down to the beach the hall is still there it broke down and run along in a wooden place and and dear and some backstage come the idea and tell them what anybody i i don't see when there's no children from some big super church and he come to criticize and whatnot he hasn't backed his mouth for baptism we still have people here who got baptized from sister and they come to the service and after service i said i want to see you you said me i said yes you get frightened i want to see you don't move you don't move yet i said don't come here this is a sovereign church a suffering group like fire under him later in the years thank god they come and repent got no dispersion yet dealing with these guys a long time though that's why i used to fight whoever survived long time used to come in young yeah i brought you up to that time i preaching man bloody smoke from a gun because i was blazing formula this is a comedy gang for a long time cooper brothers and they come to gang wrong here and they come for me and they come for me i pick out one see you you come i want to see you are you looking i said we're looking back for like my friend in front of us you are talking to deal with them one by one this battle is

omitted too many things to creep in brethren too many things that we left the old landmarks from the bedroom i began to keep we never garrosh in the church okay let me just kind of see what happened here the time has come when they are teaching doctrines of devils perverting the bible teaching into theories and theologies to draw groups and people away to them the time has come and we read this before that god will gather his church together under one great big banner of the lord jesus and poured his powers among them with great signs and wonders oh my hallelujah praise god we got you got to get back to the old pentecostal landmark what you need here in the valley i was looking around today is a good old-fashioned god sent sky blue sin killing religion the power of the holy ghost back in
