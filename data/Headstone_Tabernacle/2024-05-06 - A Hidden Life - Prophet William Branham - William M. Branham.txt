message is a hidden life amen so you amen take be a part of the the word amen by by the grace of God God bless you amen and then maybe speak on the word just for a few moments in my own oldfashioned sass R way of doing it and so uh over in Hebrews the 10th chapter and the 19th verse we read this having therefore Brethren boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus let's ask our lord to bless his word father we are so grateful to have the word for Faith cometh by hearing the word and we as your servants today as men and women sitting here coming out of the field to refresh ourselves in this convention we pray heavenly father that you'll come to us again this afternoon as thou has always done for you promised you would and would bless us together today and let Thy word find its resting place in every heart for we ask it in Jesus name amen I would thought maybe just knowing last evening and never prepare anything because it's usually something else when I get there but just happen to think on this having boldness to enter into the holiest of holiest by the blood of Jesus Christ I thought we might take a little text to say afternoon for a few moments on a hidden life now most all of us are in these conventions and so forth to try to find out how to have a closer walk with God I'm sure that's your brother's uh uh I um way this afternoon I I was thinking maybe I'd talk about the Supernatural and I don't know how to approach that it's just as much mysterious is it is to you and um well then a hidden life with Christ some way that we could hide away and get away from all of it and live with Christ am I looking at Henry Gro God bless you brother Henry I haven't seen you for a long time and brother I just happen to look back and seen dad and recogniz him when I had my great breakdown or come off the field for about 8 months they were real brother and daddy to me they stayed right with me all the time I know we'll forget the day that brother Grill up there we went out in the cornfield to pray I was so nervous I stayed in the vision so long I couldn't tell whether it was in or out I never will forget brother gr when he knelt down to pray with me put his arms around me just simple like said now Papa God will you come help brother Brandon Papa God will you come help brother Brandon that's always stay with me brother Co oh what will it be brother gr someday I hope I have my arm around you sit down with the evergreen trees where The Fountains of the Waters of life is Flowing from another Throne we have be in the presence of our Papa God then forever and forever to live in his presence now God has made it so simple and of the Bible and to make the gospel so simple to even a person like myself that's uneducated uh would have an opportunity to speak uh and preach the gospel and uh I was saying to the Brethren coming over how funny I feel to get up there today and know that before Scholars and some of the smartest men in the country sitting here and how my grammar how poor it is and how all unqualified but but you know probably you all feel this like I do if you had to set before some Bishops and so forth but you know Brethren God doesn't dwell so much in theology he dwells in love and humbleness where you can really everybody can get acquainted with him and know him I'm so glad that he's he hasn't selected just a little handful or certain denomination he said whosoever will and so that even gives me and you a chance to come in and have fellowship and speak of him now God has made it so wonderful that in the Old Testament he where usually I go to for refuge for a text once in a while he's made the Old Testament in Parables and in symbolic forms to express itself and his doings that the simple-minded might be able to have a conception of his will and what he's done many times in the Old Testament how I have went back to find the old typing the new always God did in what he's doing now in the New Testament he foreshadowed it in the Old Testament and all of those who neglected God and forsaken God in the Old Testament we can see by example what become of them and those who Dar to have faith in Jehovah and stepped out in the Old Testament we see what happened to them now we make our choice that's right and we are thank God for a free nation and a place of worship to where we each one can set our sails in the faith of God and fly away from this Earth I'm glad of that today for there's plenty places you couldn't do that now for instance in the Old Testament how God gave all of his uh Parables back there and set forth his his um things that would be a shadow of today then that's the only way that I can teach the Bible they talk about Big Greek words and so forth they just tie me in all kinds of places but if I look back and see what God did back there as a foreshadow then I have some general conception of what he's doing today because that was a shadow if I'm going to the uh to the west and my Sun's rising in the East and My Shadow is before me and if I never seen myself or never know what I look like or a human being I'd have some conception of my form when I seem a shadow and the old testment is the shadow of the coming of Christ and everything foreshadowed the cross and in Christ all God's Redemption all these plans all the Plan of Salvation all was met at Calvary now how beautiful in the Old Testament how God foreshadowed this holy spirit that we're enjoying today how that he foreshadow the order and these conventions and how we could come together in fellowship and have a a fellowship together back there we see how in the early beginning of the of the church that how that God Force shattered the place today where I think Brethren that we're entering now for this next blessing everyone knows that we're just on a bar Tim like the great blessing of Divine Healing and the powers of the supernatural it's gone out that's brought about a Revival that's actually shucked the world the hardest that's ever been shucked in all the all the time there has never been time in any age that Christianity shuck the entire world like it has in the last five or six years right and every nation under ever Place through radio through by evangelist by uh we go into a place in different countries where they don't believe in God and there they find where the ordinary missionary had passed out some tracks which is fine but when they see the operation of the supernatural tens of thousands of heathen fall at the cross and serve the Lord Jesus it's been a mighty move now we've held this ground so long and I believe with all my heart that we're on the threshold of stepping into another Veil y somewhere the were the greater mysteries of God will be known to the church and me for one I've got both ears and eyes and heart open to hear the message when it comes examine it for Satan will put out on many a false Runner but just lay it aside remember it's only signifying that something real is going to take place when you see it for Satan will do everything as I said last night to blockade the real Jewel of God when it's coming forth you'll you'll hear it he put out a blockade to catch Abel he put out one to catch Joseph one to catch Jesus and so forth and he'll do it one to get Moses for you can notice those things that Satan will try to block it and now for I believe that the many Cults and things as we see rising over the nation is only a light post to say look out it will be here soon I've noticed among our Brethren that many of you as coming into to you as Full Gospel people coming from the Baptist Church myself and accepting the doctrine of the baptism of the holy spirit being a separate uh work of the Holy Spirit and I thought then when we when the Martin Luther reached justification by faith he thought that settled it that was a light for his day and he preached it and believed it and held on to it and it was the light of that day then he entered another Veil a man John Wesley when Calvinism begin to sweep the nation and it settle down to saying what God's going to do he'll do and does is no good to have a Revival God raised up John Wesley and he certainly smashed Calvinism to the ground to the place where it ought to have its right bounds Under The Works of sanctification the second work of Grace nazarenes carried it on and Along come the Pentecostal then next in the baptism of the Holy Spirit moving on up into the higher Heights and now when the Brethren received the baptism of the Holy Ghost they said this is the summit this is all of it but Brethren that's wrong there is no Summit to God's power we move on and on and on it's the unlimited resources of God has never been tapped yet blessings and powers that we know nothing about has never been even revealed to Arch Angels is laying just ahead for his church that will believe for Eye Has Not Seen ear is not heard either has it enter the hearts of men what God has for them is story that love him so let's move up and claim name our rights as God opens the gates and swings out the welcome that let's move on up into deeper depths and never colonize ourselves to organize ourselves and to get into a place where this is we believe this and that's all let's believe this plus how much more we can hear from God I think that ought to be the motive of every man and woman that loves the Lord Jesus they'll receive all that you can from the hand of his Bountiful mercies ah it's my heart that's the reason I never JN any organization or tuck sides with any groups because I wanted myself wide open for the love of God and for what he could give to me I noticed in the Bible one time assembly as we're Church of God we are to be alone in that quiet Stillness with God don't you believe it certainly we ought to be notice when the high priest once the year entered in the first Veil then the second Veil on the outside of the levers where they wash the sacrifice then the sacrifice was killed put on the brazing Altar and the blood was put in a charger and the high priest once the year walked in behind the veil to make an atonement and notice of dressing of this high priest before he could enter the veil he had to be stripped and dressed right to go in that's what the church is today what it needs is a stripping off of all these little Cults and things and dressed in the righteousness of Jesus Christ and ready to enter [Music] in Hallelujah his walk must be different every along the hymns of His Garment he had a pomegranate and then a bell and as he walked his walk was so perfect until the bells played holy holy holy unto the Lord what we need today is not whether we are assemblies or Church of God or oness or whatever it might be our walk ought to be playing to the public holy holy holy unto the [Applause] Lord another thing he must be anointed before he goes in the anointing oil was made with the rose of Sharon and the crushing of the Rose brought forth the perfume and they put it on the or it run on Aaron's beard Plum to the hems of his skirt covered all over with the anointing or walking right living right moving right dressed right there he went taking before him the blood and as he went behind the curtain into the third room there was a veil that dropped behind him that the outside world could not see him no more more and every man or boy or woman or girl that ever is Anointed of God and Walks Behind that Temple the veil of God the Holy Ghost puts him in a secret place the veil drops behind him and the world and all of its things are cut off behind him that's the reason Brethren that we're holding up the adoption of God is our difference of life and fussing and quarreling amongst one another is a reason the veil can't drop behind us and we can go into that presence of God that's right we're so interested in our denominations we're so interested in what the next fell what's what is that to thee follow thou me it's an individual Affair between every Minister how a minister ought to always get along to himself even before he preaches before he prays before he does anything he should get alone with God in that quiet place hid away with God go how that that Veil once coming down now the furniture in this inside this veil was different from the outside way back in the congregation the lever that washed the Beast and the next veil was what it was the um the burning of the beast's body and in there was the seven golden candlesticks on the that represented the lamp and give the light and out into the outer courts was sunlight in the first veil was artificial notice and when they walk in here by this lamp then they go into the next court which was the holiest of holies as they walked in their anointed how that God has so planted out it's such a beautiful thing for us as we see the great plan there of God's Eternal salvation how that his ministers should walk in this how they should prepare themselves to enter into this now on the inside of this ENT Court the called the holiest of holies there was a piece of furniture sitting there called The Mercy Seat and the Covenant was in the ark and the Ark had two cherubin and it was on the inside that was a Furniture inside of the Holy place next coming out was the golden candlesticks then on out to the Laver now perfectly represents the age of Luther Wesley and Pentecost exactly the three steps are dispensations of his grace that's been given to Mankind we are in the last dispensation I believe that with all my heart see now notice then also in this great move how God brought them in there in this great uh Place Moses one time was told by God when the Mana Begin to Fall the Mana was a type of Life Christ coming down from heaven and perishing here on Earth that he might give us life the Mana Came From Heaven laid on the earth and the people eat it to sustain life Christ came down from heaven and become Mana that we might live by him and notice now the people eating the Mana they had to get it quickly and eat it because when the sun rose it wasn't long till it was perished the type there of Christ the Holy Spirit the Mana was a type of the Holy Ghost today as God brought the church in natural with natural manner he's bringing the church today spiritual on spiritual manner one the church had first overcome come over the Red Sea type of the blood passed over into the journey on the road to the promised land Mana rain the first night amen and when the church was passed over from Life unto death on the day of Pentecost God reigned the spiritual Mana Out of Heaven that sustained the church until Jesus comes again or we pass into the Millennium into the promised land amen oh when they picked it up and they would eat it they said it was sweet it tastes like Honey in the Rock they said tastes like honey David Called It Honey in the Rock and that's what it is now notice a tip the Mana never did cease to fall until the day they entered the promised land for 40 years the same Mana fell every day hallelujah how are you going to take the Holy Ghost and leave it at Pentecost brother it's been one continually Pentecost that cause the hardness of man's heart to fail to eat the Mana that's right notice that it was a tipe now on the day of Pentecost when our Mana as soon as the people had went into the upper room and obeyed the Commandments of the Lord Jesus and carried waited at the city of Jerusalem for the going forth of the Holy Ghost the first time there came from the heaven a sound like a Russian Mighty Wind that filled all the house where they were setting clothing tongues set up on them like fire they were all filled with the Holy Ghost and begin to speak with other tongues as the spirit gave them utterance out into the streets they went a cowardly little bunch of preachers hid away in an upper room but all of a sudden there came the mana come pouring down to sustain their souls and out into the streets they went with an experience that they had never had before a beautiful type of God sustaining his church through this journey to the promised land notice Brethren then how long was this Mana to last it lasted the entire Journey until they hit into another dispensation over into the promised land how long is this to last until Jesus comes Peter said repent every one of you and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins and you shall receive the Holy Ghost for the promises into you and to your children and to them as far off even as many as the Lord Our God shall call how long was it to last as many as the Lord Our God shall call and as long as the dispensation of Grace last God will still call men and women to his service so the Holy Ghost is just as real today now he never said now when they eat this Mana remember if they eat it many people eat it and said this is it they had to gather it fresh every day that's right that's right they had to gather the man fresh every day because along about 9:00 on their second step it would go to Melton it would perish and many times people living in God's second room even in communion after they've already received the word and come into the second step of receiving Christ into their life and never yet know what that secret room is what that bedroom what that rest place is they eat the Mana but did you notice if they let it lay too long it finally melted out there was it perished away and I think a lot of people has had a lot of Campground cramps anyhow that when they go and eat of the Lord on the campground and before another revival can come along they're all back and twisted up in some kind of cult or something else what's the matter brother you've never walked in somewhere else God said Moses make you golden pot Hallelujah and in there place this mana and remember that a Believer when he walked in there that Mana never did run out it was always fresh and new and sweet as the days went by as the years went by and any man who comes to Christ and hides away in the veil falls behind him he's in the presence of almighty God eating the Mana day and night from one hour to the other it's always just as sweet as it was the first day fell into your soul Hallelujah that's what we need today is get in where the things are at not stand off and pretend or not stand off and act but actually get in there amen thank God the man once now remember only Believers only the elect comes into that that God has chosen you I believe in Revelations 2 said he that overcometh so it's promised to Overcomers you said oh I overcome smoking that ain't what he's talking about the whole lot more goes to this Christianity besides not smoking cigarettes or drinking whiskey he that overcometh shall inherit all things and he'll be my son I'll be his God and listen I will give him of the Hidden Mana hallelujah amen I'll hide him away and I'll give him the hidden things the world on the outside of the curtain don't know nothing about it Hallelujah though they eat man but they don't know about this I'll give to him the hidden Mana I'll give him a stone with his name in it you get what I mean entering in to the adoption are the hidden place with God Ministers of the Gospel don't care about your denominations and what the world thinks but seek to enter in to the hidden Mana hallu for the full revelation of God is made love perfect in your heart and you and God and everything else is at rest let anything come what may your hidden away what a place to live oh that's let me abide there as a song said let me rest neath the tree where the so freely flows where the lamb is the light and the soul of the saved never die amen sure they ate man out there but they didn't know about this they've never been in there have you my dear brother don't despise my ignorance but I want to ask you something Have you ever come to the place in life where Christ meant more to you and all the arguing you could do about your church has Christ meant more to you than all the world I don't mean from any emotional or mental workup I mean from the depths of your heart that something settled in there at something's taking place that you don't know how it come but you're hid away and your whole motive is to serve Jesus Christ have you entered that place my dear brother have you come into that place where you don't care what anyone says not to go out and act smart but the little love of God Is So anchored into you that you can't see nothing else your whole motive is to do the will of God love for everybody flowing free from everywh a place to live that's the hidden place that's the place where we got to come to my brethren that's a place where God Reveals His secret things that's a place where God does a placing in the calling you get what I mean in this same place we don't have much time cuz I got to hurry but just for another thought in this same place they put Aaron's Rod to make a decision who God had chosen who he hadn't and that Rod that was a dead stick and one night's time come to life brought buds brought flowers and brought arms it both come to life brought blossoms and yielded fruits a very [Music] typical pattern of The Sinner being brought to God into the holy Place remember that Rod passed over every one of those other elements and it got inside the holy place still dead but to abide it never come to life when he brought first brought it in there that's the reason the holy spirit's watched you since you receive the Holy Ghost see your attitude towards his King Kingdom if it's been selfish motives if the things that you thought of is in farther denomination or if it's to in farther better you your position if to make you a man looked up to in the world if it's to build you a big church somewhere or some popularity or some other thing outside of increasing or EMB bettering the kingdom of God brother something's wrong amen now when that old dead Rod was brought in there and laid in the presence of God himself what happened it budded it blossomed and it yielded fruit right showing that we borned in that Rod was off of an alond tree and when it was cut off it died and when man was cut off from God he died spiritually but once brought into the place of God before the presence of God he comes to life and he yields life he yield blossoms he yields fruit Jesus come to the tree to look for fruit on it it had everything but fruit that's right and that's what's the matter with our churches today we got everything but fruit we can shout we can speak with tongues we can argue the scriptures we can teach our theology but when it comes to fruit bearing the tree is very lean what is the fruits of the spirit love joy peace longsuffering gentleness goodness patience that's it shows many is still outside on the first altar you're still open to the public you're still listening to hear what John's got to say about it what the neighbor will think or something for yourself but once behind the bail and the curtains has dropped you're hiding God to Christ see notice what a beautiful picture of the cner laying in the presence of God now this Rod laying there it was refreshed it was fragnant brought the fragrance of the Blossom and it yielded fruit the buds came forth now a beautiful type of that is given Earthly speaking the first thing that we have to do before we can have a crop we have to have seed and the seed placed in the ground will yield its fruits is that right now the first thing we have to do is to receive receive Christ now the tree had to be an almond tree to start with and Christ you have to receive him before you come into this place and then in the presence of this great God then these things take place what see the word Christ was the word in the beginning was the word and the word is with God and the Word was God Christ comes into the life of the human being now notice the first thing was a refreshment what makes a sea grow did you ever get up of a morning and find the Dew that's fell down from heaven and refreshes the Earth how does it refresh it when it's at peace the D don't fall in daytime the DW falls in the night time when everything is is at peace the D can never fall on you my brother as long as you're fussing and arguing and stewing about the things you're on this Earth get along with God and let the D Drops of Mercy P upon on you in the Stillness Precious Memories how they linger how they ever fill my soul in the Stillness of the midnight Secret Secrets unfold how that God can get his believer with the curtains dropped around him alone to himself he'll bring down a refreshing from Heavens that there's no other person or no other way in the world to ever know it only he that's laying there did you ever walk out of a morning that real fresh School feeling God has refreshed his Earth fragnant did you ever go into a rose garden down my place that got a lot of honeysuckles the honeysuckle don't smell much along In the Heat of the day but it's early of the morning when all the air has been purified then that Romeo of the honeysuckle let a man be out fussing fighting stewing and you'll never get much of a Roma from that of the Gospel but let him get alone one time in the Stillness of God every man that comes to the pulpit ought to dwell alone first then comes the fruits yielding forth its fruits every man that stays in the presence of God into this great secret place hid away will yield the fruits of righteousness peace love joy longsuffering goodness gentl patience don't fuss about these other things get that in your life and you'll never get it till you hide away with God into that land of adoption another thing we'll call your attention just before we close look at the light on the outside in the courts it was the fervent that Lit it up sunlight and so forth some days was cloudy some days the sun didn't shine at all some days it was dark now that's in the outer Court the next court was the lamp of God where the Justified stands and it was lit by human hands that's where we argue our denominations where we argue our differences split hairs and oh I don't believe in Divine Healing I don't believe them Visions come from God I don't believe this I don't believe that you're arguing because you're living yet you're eating Mana but you're living under artificial light that's right sometimes the lights goes out sometimes your lamp gets smoked up but to he who desires to hide away walk into the next place there's no artificial life anywhere but down in between the arch of the wings of these Chans was a supernatural light hanging in there which was a Halo of God that Lit the whole room and a man once entered into that Shak Glory Hallelujah that news back there in the presence of the dness of this world and the artificial organizations and whole manmade Creed has passed away and he's living in the shakina glory of almighty God my brethren let's ask God for that place to live shall We Stand oh dear Jesus Christ the son of the Living God my dear brothers and sisters who are standing here now this afternoon in the housing place of this little church called the Philadelphia church named after brotherly love I pray thee dear God to be merciful from the pastor to every event evangelist and ever noted Pastor our teacher that's in divine presence and oh God May the Holy Ghost wrap our hearts so tight against the cross until we'll grab it up Hallelujah self-sacrificial and rush to the Shak of Glory right quick where we'll not be running across the Earth and splitting hairs with man and arguing about whether this is right or not but live and abide in his presence and eat the Mana that's been stored up there for those who are HID with him Grant it Lord May that blessing fall on this convention and every man and woman go away from here hid away under sh Glory of almighty God granted
