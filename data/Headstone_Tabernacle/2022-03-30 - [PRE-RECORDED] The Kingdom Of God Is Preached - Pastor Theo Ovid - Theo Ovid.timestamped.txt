[20:06] way you think hallelujah it will change
[20:09] the way you walk you will not walk the

[20:22] you're going praise god oh hallelujah
[20:25] but raymond thompson was tremendous
[20:27] praise god we're talking about how you
[20:29] hear from god vertical
[20:31] some people only hearing only talking
[20:32] horizontal from man to man to man to man
[20:35] to man did not hear him from above
[20:38] oh glory to god but you had to hear from
[20:39] above then you could go across
[20:42] praise god hallelujah praise god when
[20:44] you hear from above then he could go
[20:46] across to others but you've got to hear
[20:48] from god as a son of god as a daughter
[20:50] of god you know what brother branham
[20:52] says the bride has the ability to hear
[20:54] from god
[20:55] so you could be vaccinated in 25 years
[20:57] that has nothing to do with it
[20:59] when god ready to speak to his son he
[21:01] gonna speak to his son and nobody could
[21:03] stop that god from speaking to his son
[21:05] or his daughter or his children
[21:08] do you believe that
[21:10] oh glory to god hallelujah hallelujah
[21:13] hallelujah understand this
[21:15] all around you is just earthly trappings
[21:19] environmental issues of the egyptian
[21:22] life so when they take moses moses was
[21:24] an ordinary hebrew baby
[21:27] but he was sealed into the hands of
[21:29] pharaoh
[21:30] and they raised him up as a prince
[21:32] all he knew is his royal highness
[21:35] all he knew is grapes and everything
[21:37] nice around him but that's just the
[21:39] ultraman
[21:40] that's just his human spirit that's that
[21:42] the gene taught in his soul
[21:45] no that's the trappings of egypt but
[21:48] when god was ready to get that man
[21:52] hallelujah nothing could stop it not the
[21:54] woman not the money not the popularity
[21:58] not the style of life nothing going to
[22:01] stop that man
[22:02] from coming face to face into what god
[22:05] ordained him to be
[22:07] what could stop you this morning
[22:10] when you ordained the comfort
[22:12] god grew when he was thinking about you
[22:15] god travailed when he was bringing you
[22:18] for
[22:19] you've got to come for
[22:21] okay we give the lord a shout of praise
[22:24] this morning
[22:26] you want to go into the world
[22:29] let's just stand up we want to sing
[22:31] through the blood through the blood
[22:33] through the blood we can come into his
[22:34] presence
[22:36] through the blood
[22:38] remember this friends all have sinned
[22:39] and come short of the glory
[22:42] not some
[22:43] all
[22:45] all have sinned
[22:46] so you really can't
[22:48] sit down on a self-righteous chair
[22:51] and judge this one and judge that one
[22:53] and condemn this one and ripo this one
[22:56] no there's a chance there's an
[22:58] opportunity there's a possibility that
[23:00] that blood
[23:01] could speak on that person's behalf
[23:03] let's close your eyes and say true
[23:11] [Music]
[23:15] through
[23:18] [Applause]
[23:22] says
[23:40] [Music]
[23:43] the blood
[23:44] [Applause]
[23:46] through
[23:48] [Music]
[24:01] jesus
[24:04] [Applause]
[24:17] before i read the word i want to raise
[24:18] her hand just worship him as the music
[24:20] plays
[24:22] [Music]
[24:29] [Music]
[24:33] oh glory
[24:35] hallelujah
[24:37] [Music]
[24:54] into his presence
[25:04] this morning we want to look at three
[25:05] portion scriptures luke 16
[25:08] verse 16
[25:10] luke 17 2 verses
[25:12] 20
[25:13] and 21
[25:15] and from the book of hebrews
[25:17] want to read verse chapter 12
[25:20] verse 25
[25:22] to 29.
[25:36] luke 16 16 reads the law
[25:40] and the prophets will until john
[25:43] since that time the kingdom of god is
[25:45] preached
[25:46] and every man
[25:48] present
[25:49] into it
[25:56] luke 17 20
[25:59] and when he was demanded of the
[26:00] pharisees
[26:02] when the kingdom of god should come
[26:06] he answered them and said
[26:08] the kingdom of god cometh not with
[26:10] observation
[26:12] neither shall they say low here or low
[26:14] there
[26:15] for behold
[26:17] the kingdom of god
[26:19] is within you
[26:24] and hebrews 12 25
[26:27] see that he refused on him that speaketh
[26:30] for if they escape not
[26:32] who refused him that spake on earth
[26:36] much more shall not be escaped
[26:38] if we turn away from him that speaker
[26:40] from heaven
[26:41] whose voice then shook the earth
[26:44] i know he had promised saying
[26:46] yet once more
[26:48] i shake not the earth only but also
[26:50] heaven and this word
[26:53] yet once more
[26:55] signifying the removing of those things
[26:57] that are shaking
[26:59] as of things that are made
[27:01] that those things which cannot be shaken
[27:02] may remain
[27:04] wherefore we receiving a kingdom
[27:08] which cannot be moved
[27:10] let us have grace whereby we may serve
[27:12] god acceptably
[27:13] with reverence and reverence and godly
[27:15] fear
[27:16] for our god is a consuming fire let's
[27:19] bow our heads father god we thank you
[27:20] for your word and we pray that you're
[27:22] giving sight
[27:24] and inspire to our hearts
[27:26] and speak to us lord that will be
[27:28] changed and will be transformed how i
[27:31] thank you for the word vision
[27:34] that you have unfolded in this are
[27:36] may each plug into it and get into it
[27:39] that they can see themselves in the word
[27:41] and conduct conduct themselves correctly
[27:44] in json we ask it
[27:46] amen and amen you may be seated oh
[27:48] blessed be the name
[27:50] of the lord give the lord some praises
[27:53] as you have your seat oh blessed be the
[27:56] name of the lord
[27:57] hallelujah hallelujah
[28:00] praise be to jesus
[28:02] oh glory to god
[28:05] hallelujah you love him
[28:07] oh praise be to jesus
[28:10] but
[28:11] my my my my my
[28:14] oh
[28:15] hallelujah praise god
[28:18] hallelujah
[28:20] i will context scripture here from uh
[28:22] this is from mark you'd have to find it
[28:24] mark 1 14. now after that john was put
[28:26] in prison
[28:29] jesus came into galilee preaching the
[28:31] gospel
[28:33] of the kingdom of god
[28:35] and saying
[28:37] the time
[28:38] is fulfilled
[28:40] the kingdom of god is at hand
[28:43] repent ye
[28:44] and believe the gospel
[28:46] o blessed be the name of the lord so
[28:49] this morning my title is the kingdom of
[28:51] god is preached
[28:53] and my subject is the kingdom is not in
[28:56] word
[28:57] but in power
[28:59] i have an inspiration striving to enter
[29:02] and be positionally placed
[29:11] so today we want to talk a little bit
[29:12] about
[29:14] this kingdom of god and how to do some
[29:17] search some research
[29:19] because
[29:20] in africa like in nigeria and different
[29:22] parts of africa they still have
[29:24] kings they still have chiefs
[29:27] and some time ago we're sharing with the
[29:29] brethren across there that we in the
[29:31] west we have no concept of that
[29:34] i don't know what that is
[29:36] we have prime minister and presidents
[29:38] and so on we don't know about that we
[29:40] have never lived in that environment of
[29:43] king and chiefs
[29:44] and and and so on we have never lived in
[29:47] that kingdom type thing
[29:49] uh the british has it they have to say
[29:51] of the queen and so on that's a kingdom
[29:54] uh the french had it different kingdoms
[29:56] and empire but it's not something
[29:58] familiar with us
[30:00] but we want to kind of get into it
[30:02] this morning a bit
[30:04] i have another scripture here from john
[30:06] 18 then pilate entered in the judgment
[30:08] hall again called jesus and said unto
[30:10] him i doubt the king of the jews
[30:12] and jesus answered him saying says thou
[30:15] distinct of thyself
[30:17] or did others tell it d of me
[30:20] and pilate answered am i a jew i know
[30:23] nation and chief priests have delivered
[30:25] thee unto me what has thou done
[30:28] and jesus answered my kingdom
[30:31] is not of this world
[30:34] if my kingdom were of this world notice
[30:37] we're not talking about church
[30:40] ah
[30:41] courtyard we're not talking about church
[30:43] you see the church part is easy you go
[30:45] to church you go back home
[30:47] but this is not church now this is
[30:49] kingdom
[30:50] he said my kingdom is not of this world
[30:54] watch
[30:55] if my kingdom were of this world then
[30:58] would my servants fight that i should
[31:00] not be delivered to the jews but now is
[31:02] my kingdom not from hence
[31:04] and the amplified say this way jesus
[31:07] answered my kingdom or kinship or royal
[31:12] power belongs not to this world if my
[31:15] kingdom or of this world my followers
[31:17] who have been fighting to keep me from
[31:19] being handed over to the jews but as it
[31:21] is my kingdom is not from here it has no
[31:25] such source or origin
[31:28] i kind of like that
[31:29] so the kingdom where i am from this
[31:31] earth didn't source it it didn't
[31:33] originate from this earth i am not from
[31:35] here
[31:36] oh glory to god hallelujah do you
[31:38] believe that
[31:40] okay just a little background we've
[31:42] always had to preach a kingdom as a king
[31:46] and the king owns everything in the
[31:48] kingdom
[31:49] including the people themselves
[31:52] in the kingdom the people are called
[31:54] subjects or citizens
[31:58] that's why ephesians 3 said we are no
[32:00] more strangers
[32:01] or aliens but fellow citizens of the
[32:04] whole show of god
[32:06] hallelujah
[32:08] are you with me
[32:09] and i like that the people are called
[32:11] subjects
[32:12] because they're subject to the king
[32:14] you don't vote the king in
[32:17] and you don't vote the king out
[32:19] it is not a democracy
[32:21] it's not the people's choice
[32:23] the king owns everything
[32:25] or could we give the lord a shout and
[32:27] pray
[32:28] no i don't want you to see it from a
[32:30] natural standpoint i want you to see
[32:32] from a heavenly standpoint we messiah is
[32:34] the king of king and he owns everything
[32:38] hallelujah
[32:39] are you with me
[32:41] so the definition or the subject is a
[32:44] person
[32:45] who is under the dominion or rule of a
[32:47] sovereign king
[32:49] when you live in the kingdom you are
[32:51] under the rule
[32:53] of the king
[32:54] in a kingdom everyone have a job or
[32:57] purpose to fulfill and the kingdom of
[32:59] god is no different
[33:02] the bible is all about a king
[33:04] his kingdom his royal children to be
[33:07] accepted as a child of god you must
[33:09] accept that he choose a kingdom rule
[33:12] not communism
[33:14] not a republic not a democracy but a
[33:16] kingdom rule
[33:18] so now you could understand when the
[33:20] people of israel asked for king
[33:23] and god told samuel they have not
[33:25] rejected you
[33:26] they have rejected me
[33:28] because god seeing that i am their king
[33:31] why should they ask for a king when i am
[33:34] their king they have not rejected you
[33:36] they have rejected me because i as king
[33:39] supposed to rule and reign over their
[33:41] lives
[33:42] because somebody give a lord a shelter
[33:43] praise
[33:44] hallelujah glory to god so the kingdom
[33:49] comes from king and domain a king have
[33:52] to have a domain or territory to which
[33:54] to rule so that's where the word kingdom
[33:56] come from a king over a domain isn't
[33:59] that right
[34:00] a kingdom is a governing impact of a
[34:02] king who will over a territory or domain
[34:05] his influence over the people isn't that
[34:08] right and a kingdom always have a king
[34:11] but that king is automatically a lord
[34:14] even up to now in england they have lord
[34:15] this and lord that and lord that that
[34:17] from way we old school there lord isn't
[34:20] that right and it's the quality of
[34:21] lordship that distinguishes a king from
[34:24] president prime minister mayor or
[34:27] governor in fact a king's lordship makes
[34:30] him different from any kind a leader
[34:33] lordship make the king unique a king
[34:36] sovereignty is absolute it's not it's
[34:38] unquestionable there's again more than
[34:40] 10 commandments so let it be written so
[34:42] let it be done to him is absolute so let
[34:45] it be written so let it be done their
[34:47] word is lord their word is god and jesus
[34:49] he is king and he is also lord whatever
[34:52] he speaks it's got to come to pass
[34:54] whatever he speaks it can't fail
[34:56] whatever it speaks it's going to go rate
[34:58] and create itself isn't that right
[35:01] hallelujah hallelujah
[35:02] glory to god
[35:04] so therefore the domain refers to
[35:06] territory dominion refers to the king
[35:10] to the king's authority
[35:13] so kings
[35:16] okay i'll just skip that
[35:19] all kingdoms have certain qualities i'm
[35:21] going to just strike some of them
[35:23] all kingdoms have a king
[35:25] a lord a sovereign amen all kingdoms
[35:28] have a territory
[35:29] all kingdoms have a constitution
[35:32] all kingdoms have citizenry or subjects
[35:34] they have laws they have privileges
[35:37] they have code of ethics they have an
[35:39] army they have a culture
[35:41] all
[35:42] kingdoms
[35:43] just want to strike
[35:45] just one or two with that i want to talk
[35:47] about this citizenry a little bit
[35:49] the citizenry is the people that live
[35:51] under the rule of the king amen citizens
[35:53] in a kingdom is not a right but a
[35:55] privilege as a result of the king's
[35:57] choice
[35:58] the benefits and privileges of a kingdom
[36:01] are only accessible to citizens
[36:05] that's why it's good when you become a
[36:06] citizen
[36:07] of the kingdom
[36:09] it means all the rights of the kingdom
[36:11] is available to you
[36:13] you don't have to access them but they
[36:15] belong to you
[36:16] you know if you're sick you can call the
[36:17] ambulance if you want but it's up to you
[36:20] to accept the health services that the
[36:22] government offer
[36:23] it's not that it's not there it is there
[36:25] is if you want to access it
[36:28] your healing is there your deliverance
[36:30] is there your breakthrough is near
[36:32] hallelujah yes your breakthrough is
[36:34] there it's whether or not you want to
[36:37] access it or you want to stay how you
[36:39] are but if you know you are citizen of
[36:41] the kingdom then you have a right to joy
[36:43] you're the right to peace you're a
[36:44] righteous ritual because you belong to
[36:47] the kingdom you are no longer a stranger
[36:50] you are not an alien you're not a
[36:52] foreigner you don't have to look along
[36:53] like if you don't belong here this is
[36:55] your home
[36:56] [Applause]
[36:59] oh give the lord a shout
[37:01] hallelujah you belong in his presence
[37:05] whose presence the presence of the king
[37:07] oh give the lord some praises people
[37:10] oh hallelujah
[37:12] glory
[37:14] hallelujah
[37:15] the king is obligated to care for and
[37:18] protect all citizens
[37:20] and their welfare is a reflection on the
[37:22] king himself
[37:23] oh glory to god it's the king
[37:25] responsibility the battle is not yours
[37:28] the citizens in the fight
[37:30] the army has fight for the citizens the
[37:32] battle is not yours it's the laws the
[37:35] lord will fight for us
[37:36] but glory to god the egyptians you see
[37:38] today you shall see them no more foreign
[37:41] come unto the lord i shout the praise we
[37:43] gotta know you're gonna know who you are
[37:45] you're gonna know who you are
[37:47] you are royalty oh give the lost and
[37:50] praise this people
[37:52] hallelujah hallelujah you are sons and
[37:54] daughters of the living god you are
[37:57] children of the father you are children
[37:59] of the king
[38:01] oh give the lord a shout out
[38:03] glory to god amen
[38:06] hallelujah
[38:08] glory glory glory
[38:11] the privilege
[38:12] the privileges
[38:15] are the benefits the king lavishes on
[38:16] his faithful citizens
[38:20] this aspect is different from other
[38:22] forms of government
[38:23] in a kingdom
[38:25] citizenship is always desired by the
[38:27] people because once you are in the
[38:29] kingdom the king is personally
[38:32] responsible for you and your needs
[38:35] and because the king owns everything
[38:38] within his kingdom he could give to any
[38:41] citizen any or all of his wealth
[38:44] that he desires
[38:47] i'm gonna leave it up today i'm gonna go
[38:48] forward
[38:49] oh glory to god hallelujah it's up to
[38:51] the king
[38:53] oh to give whosoever he will you can't
[38:56] tell the king don't give this one though
[38:58] he is the king
[38:59] and he is suffering
[39:01] grace is suffering
[39:03] love is sovereign heal hallelujah give
[39:06] the lord a shout you going to be
[39:08] delivered this morning
[39:10] oh glory to god if you want to deliver
[39:12] this morning is your morning today is
[39:15] your day
[39:16] for your breakthrough you're gonna know
[39:18] whose son you are whose daughter you are
[39:20] you're gonna know that today hallelujah
[39:24] oh glory to god amen
[39:26] hallelujah
[39:27] [Applause]
[39:35] how do they raise these royal children
[39:37] never did this before
[39:39] it's very interesting
[39:41] [Music]
[39:43] as reading
[39:45] they don't raise their children
[39:48] some of these queens or whatever it is
[39:50] they see the children one or for the day
[39:52] they turn a play center what they call
[39:54] royal nannies and tutors and people
[39:56] responsible for that now i understand
[39:59] why
[40:00] when the baby is born is an ordinary
[40:02] baby
[40:03] if prince william's baby was born and
[40:06] they send that baby to trinidad to be
[40:08] raised and train their parents and so on
[40:09] that baby will be raised like a
[40:10] trinidadian
[40:12] when he kind of talks he will talk
[40:13] trinidadian he will go to the school's
[40:15] normal normal he wouldn't even know he's
[40:17] a prince
[40:21] so when you're born you don't know
[40:22] you're a prince this and prince that
[40:25] prince the other you don't know you are
[40:26] kings and priests you think you are
[40:28] ordinary baby that's why you come to
[40:31] church to come on the tutors and
[40:33] governors
[40:35] come on now you know where i'm going you
[40:37] know where i'm going you know where i am
[40:40] going that's why i'm telling you you're
[40:42] not going to be the same after this
[40:44] service
[40:45] [Applause]
[40:48] glory hallelujah
[40:50] oh glory
[40:53] you see
[40:54] you see they have to teach the babies
[40:56] from small
[40:58] you are not
[40:59] like everybody else
[41:01] the other people are commoners
[41:06] the other people are egyptians
[41:08] [Applause]
[41:10] but you are jews
[41:12] the other people is of the eighth
[41:15] but you are from heaven
[41:17] you are not ordinary
[41:18] praise god you are somebody
[41:22] you are attribute sons of his spirit i'm
[41:25] not hearing you this morning
[41:26] i'm not hearing you this morning
[41:28] oh glory to god
[41:30] glory to god
[41:32] no doesn't that sound familiar
[41:34] to what the prophet taught us you may be
[41:36] seated he said when a tal is born
[41:38] into the kingdom he is placed on the
[41:41] tutors
[41:46] the parents don't raise him the tutors
[41:49] raised him and the tutors reported the
[41:51] father
[41:52] hold the sun coming along
[41:55] come on now come on now we talking about
[41:57] adoption
[41:59] we're talking about loyalty we're
[42:01] talking about the kings the kingdom
[42:04] oh hallelujah we're talking about whose
[42:07] son am i now
[42:09] oh give the lord a shout of praise
[42:16] so you leave that child alone
[42:18] to mix with the other children play with
[42:21] the other children whether england
[42:22] otherwise he would be just another child
[42:24] laughing talking whatever he would know
[42:26] the pics of royalty
[42:28] the culture what he's responsible for
[42:31] how he must view himself you see you
[42:33] have to get him into royal thinking and
[42:35] that's what god wanted to do to you
[42:37] because you are kings and priests you
[42:40] have to get to change your mind batman
[42:42] said be transformed by the renewing of
[42:45] your mind
[42:46] that you may prove what is that good and
[42:48] acceptable and perfect will of god
[42:51] oh hallelujah hallelujah so some point
[42:54] in time that's why jesus oh yes
[42:58] you may be seated
[42:59] when jesus rose from the dead one of the
[43:01] disciples he opened up the word
[43:03] and he opened up the understanding
[43:05] to show them that their royalty to show
[43:07] them what they're about to receive that
[43:09] they want to get power they see power
[43:12] yet because the kingdom
[43:14] is not in word oh glory come on now let
[43:17] me preach somebody i said the kingdom my
[43:19] man is not in word
[43:21] but this is in power that's first
[43:24] corinthians 4 20 the kingdom
[43:26] [Applause]
[43:29] hallelujah
[43:31] hallelujah
[43:32] hallelujah but i've got news for you the
[43:35] kingdom is preached
[43:38] oh hallelujah
[43:41] glory to god the kingdom will be
[43:43] preached
[43:45] you're going to receive the kingdom
[43:47] you're going to have the kingdom
[43:49] oh glory to god hallelujah hallelujah
[43:51] hallelujah could we take some more
[43:54] so therefore
[43:56] much of the history
[43:58] the young children of british monarchs
[44:00] were primarily raised by nannies
[44:03] almost never mixed with commoners
[44:05] and spent much of their time being
[44:08] drilled by private tutors
[44:11] in history
[44:12] decorum
[44:13] and various languages
[44:16] they are tutored into royalty
[44:18] to think and act and live a certain way
[44:23] oh hallelujah so when they jump on them
[44:25] royal carriages and then chariots and
[44:27] everybody wave and they're supposed to
[44:29] get that wave because they are who they
[44:31] are
[44:32] oh coming and we are compass about with
[44:34] so many angels and the angel of god and
[44:37] compass around those that fear him
[44:40] oh
[44:41] hallelujah are you with me
[44:44] glory
[44:45] all right so that's the background
[44:48] let's get down into the word now
[44:51] hallelujah you love him
[44:53] love what are you going so far
[44:55] you realize it's not about church now
[44:58] oh hallelujah it's not about church now
[45:00] church is over
[45:02] oh my gosh
[45:05] when the kingdom come oh glory to god
[45:09] our father who art in heaven hallowed be
[45:11] thy name thy kingdom come but when the
[45:13] kingdom has come church over
[45:16] come on give the lord a shout
[45:18] you don't belong to no man
[45:20] you don't belong to this church
[45:23] no you belong to the kingdom of god
[45:26] [Applause]
[45:30] hebrews
[45:31] people say we have received a kingdom
[45:34] that cannot
[45:37] be moved
[45:39] okay
[45:40] he said oh god there's some white people
[45:41] talk about take me back to sheikah glory
[45:44] take me in the field with you
[45:46] i'm satisfied with jesus
[45:49] let me loose myself and find it in you
[45:53] get into the inner veil where all the
[45:55] wholes of the world the bible says in
[45:57] the last days there will come a famine
[45:59] upon the earth not for bread and water
[46:01] alone but for hearing the true word of
[46:04] god and people will go from the east to
[46:06] the west and everywhere trying to find
[46:09] it that hour is here
[46:11] here we go listen
[46:13] the hour is here where men are putting
[46:16] themselves up like gods
[46:18] and wanting to be glorified
[46:20] because the people said doctor so and so
[46:22] big so and so all paul said i have one
[46:25] fear
[46:26] that is except you would try to worship
[46:28] me instead of the thing that i'm
[46:29] preaching
[46:30] i never come to you with an enchanted
[46:32] word of man's wisdom but in the power of
[46:34] the resurrection of jesus christ
[46:37] gabriel instructions i understand this
[46:39] comes covers in the last days i
[46:40] understand that nation will be in
[46:42] against nation i understand that women
[46:44] will pop their head off in the last days
[46:46] i understand they wear short clothes
[46:48] walk with high heel shoes i understand
[46:49] that the mall will be so low i
[46:51] understand preachers will be false
[46:52] shepherds in the last days that will
[46:54] compromise i will not feed the people
[46:57] the word of god but will go after creeds
[46:59] and things instead but i understand that
[47:01] there will be a voice coming the last
[47:03] days crying out in the wilderness
[47:05] calling the people back to the original
[47:07] message
[47:08] back to the things of god
[47:10] i understand those things will take
[47:12] place i understand the last days become
[47:14] a famine here we go
[47:16] yeah
[47:17] the churches will be so organized so set
[47:21] in the last days there come a famine it
[47:24] will not be bread and water but for
[47:25] hearing the true word of god people go
[47:28] from the east the west the north and
[47:29] south seeking to hear the true word
[47:32] hear how they're gonna be starved out of
[47:34] it but the churches will be so organized
[47:36] and tightened that they failed to hear
[47:38] it
[47:39] they'll be settling to churchianity
[47:42] that's why brahma was so against
[47:43] organization because organization is
[47:45] rebellion against god
[47:47] because the organization makes you
[47:49] independent of his authority and
[47:51] kingship dominion
[47:54] hallelujah when man israel and god can
[47:56] rule
[47:57] come on wherever man is reigning god can
[48:00] be king
[48:01] an organization is man ruling and
[48:04] reigning over god's people that's why he
[48:06] says i'm gonna come now and call my
[48:08] sheep myself
[48:12] there'll be one more ride
[48:14] all glory to god but it will not be
[48:17] worth only
[48:18] it's gonna be power
[48:20] and demonstration of the holy ghost it
[48:22] will be the kingdom of god that has come
[48:27] all glory to god hallelujah
[48:30] hallelujah hallelujah
[48:32] glory to god amen
[48:34] oh hallelujah
[48:37] the church will be so organized
[48:39] tighten up
[48:40] that they will fail to hear it
[48:43] oh glory to god and i understand that by
[48:45] books
[48:46] i understand you said elijah before the
[48:49] day comes at the end time
[48:52] and rather messed it up we'll turn the
[48:53] half of the train back to the fathers
[48:55] turn them back to the original go back
[48:57] again to the end and start
[49:00] i understand that that takes place just
[49:04] before the spirit leaves a gentile
[49:06] church
[49:07] to return to the jews
[49:08] for the spirit to go to the jews have to
[49:10] leave the gentile church the spirit is
[49:12] about to leave here that's why we are
[49:13] striving
[49:14] before it leaves think about it like a
[49:16] tail about to leave and you are hanging
[49:18] inside a deer you are pressing the enter
[49:20] to get him and be positioned on the
[49:22] place before the straight splat strike
[49:25] oh glory to god hallelujah hallelujah
[49:29] oh my god praise god amen
[49:33] from the baptism holy spirit brother
[49:34] brandon if the baptist turned me down
[49:36] the methodist
[49:37] the pentecostal upon the initial
[49:39] evidence speaking in tongues that's the
[49:40] reason we're not penecostals we don't
[49:42] believe that speaking of tongues makes
[49:44] you feel the holy ghost no more no you
[49:46] leave living in a band make you a pig
[49:48] all right
[49:49] or you standing like all right doesn't
[49:50] make you a cup
[49:53] no more than living at king's past will
[49:54] make you a king you could be a servant
[49:59] we believe
[50:00] you receive the holy ghost by an
[50:02] experience
[50:05] not by some mythical intellectual
[50:07] conception of the scriptures
[50:08] lord quickness to me
[50:11] but come to me my understanding open up
[50:14] no
[50:16] but by an experience that you alone know
[50:20] and if you want to know whether it was
[50:22] the holy ghost
[50:23] watch how your life patterns after that
[50:28] not watch so much revelation watch how
[50:31] your life
[50:32] patterns after the experience
[50:34] and it will tell what kind of spirit
[50:36] that coming to you
[50:38] oh give the lord a shout our praise
[50:40] oh
[50:41] hallelujah
[50:42] glory
[50:44] hallelujah
[50:46] you see everlasting and there's no
[50:48] question answers everlasting eternal is
[50:49] two different things and israel was cast
[50:51] out but not out of god's mind
[50:53] and paul was saying here that we
[50:55] gentiles have to take heed the way we
[50:57] walk
[50:59] because if god didn't spare the first
[51:01] branch
[51:02] which was the original branch and we
[51:04] were grafted in and israel was blinded
[51:06] for a season just for season is always
[51:09] blinded that's right but the veil will
[51:11] be lifted from the eyes
[51:13] and that is when here we go
[51:16] the last gentile is born into the
[51:19] kingdom of god
[51:23] then another quote he said maybe the
[51:24] last time i mean africa
[51:26] when that last one is sealed the book is
[51:28] closed
[51:29] not one more person is saved after that
[51:32] amen
[51:34] the pride will be on the earth
[51:35] witnessing god unveiling god because you
[51:38] know what adoption is adoption is
[51:40] unveiling god
[51:41] [Music]
[51:43] adoption without bringing tracks and
[51:45] courts and preaching word
[51:47] no
[51:48] man
[51:51] jesus didn't preach about healing he
[51:53] healed the people
[51:54] jesus didn't preach about raising the
[51:56] dead he raised the dead
[51:58] jesus didn't preach about the caster
[51:59] devils he cast out devils he did the job
[52:03] because the kingdom
[52:06] is not inward
[52:08] but in power
[52:12] but you have a promise
[52:13] acts 1 8
[52:15] you shall receive power
[52:18] after the holy ghost
[52:21] come upon you
[52:22] so all the messages messages messages
[52:26] all the mysteries mysteries mysteries
[52:28] have to unlock the key
[52:30] to bring them the power the prophet said
[52:32] it is this the mystery of the thunders
[52:35] to bring back the power into the church
[52:38] the mission of the tunnels to bring back
[52:39] the headstone
[52:43] all glory glory glory glory hallelujah
[52:46] hallelujah

[52:49] when the last gentile
[52:51] is born into the kingdom of god
[52:54] notice not coming to the message
[52:59] notice not believe gods and a prophet
[53:02] no
[53:03] when that last gentile
[53:05] is born
[53:07] into the kingdom
[53:08] [Applause]
[53:10] amen
[53:11] amen
[53:12] hallelujah
[53:16] [Music]
[53:19] the gentile door is closed
[53:21] there is no grace left for the gentile
[53:24] at that time
[53:25] oh hallelujah
[53:28] five definite identification of the
[53:29] church
[53:30] but ibrano
[53:31] we have access to our king
[53:34] we have an interview with him whenever
[53:36] we want to call upon him we have no
[53:38] other intercessors
[53:40] no other mediator between the king and
[53:42] us
[53:43] but one man christ jesus the bible call
[53:46] it the messiah kingdom in other words
[53:48] where the messiah rules
[53:50] in every life
[53:52] in his dominion ruling the lives of his
[53:54] people are called our people he's the
[53:56] core lord one
[53:58] oh hallelujah now the church of god
[54:00] today is the same thing called out of
[54:02] the world called out of a religious cult
[54:04] call out of every religious denomination
[54:06] call out of every religious organization
[54:08] to walk with god not being governed by a
[54:11] bishop
[54:12] but being governed by christ
[54:14] in his messiah oh my
[54:18] ah
[54:22] hallelujah
[54:27] oh being gone by christ in his messiah
[54:29] kingdom
[54:30] christ is the king now you see what the
[54:33] church means church means call a bunch
[54:35] call out people that is governed by the
[54:38] king of this messiah kingdom
[54:42] oh glory to god is not wonderful
[54:45] no
[54:46] the kingdom
[54:47] the messiah empire the right to put it
[54:49] the messiah can pass so barbara doing
[54:51] research himself
[54:52] he's referring to a writer
[54:54] he's he like that there is that one such
[54:55] thing as church of the living god ever
[54:57] been organized
[54:59] organization is something that was
[55:00] adapted adopted to take the place of
[55:04] but when god was made flesh and become
[55:05] the messiah
[55:07] then if we yield ourselves to be
[55:08] anointed like he was we become messiahs
[55:12] we become little lights
[55:14] isn't that right god i like this messiah
[55:17] church so the real church of god
[55:19] supposed to be a bunch of little
[55:21] messiahs
[55:22] when they see you they see jesus
[55:24] they thought they just see jesus passed
[55:25] by they see another brother come and see
[55:26] jesus again they see your sister passed
[55:28] by this jesus again they said that
[55:30] plenty jesus no plenty messiahs plenty
[55:32] little messiahs little ones like him
[55:35] because they are they are royalty
[55:38] oh no they are sons and daughters of
[55:40] living god then you walk like a prince
[55:42] you talk like a prince you act like a
[55:44] prince you live like a priest you don't
[55:45] live like a dog you live right you talk
[55:47] right you act right give the lord a
[55:49] shout in the house
[55:50] [Applause]
[55:55] glory
[55:57] if messiah means anointed one
[56:00] and means king
[56:01] then if the church is anointed by the
[56:03] messiah spirit
[56:04] it become a lesser but still a messiah
[56:07] because it has his light reflecting his
[56:10] power
[56:11] reflecting his glory reflecting his
[56:13] dominion so it is the messiah how to
[56:16] reflect him in his kingdom in his domain
[56:18] as i told him in africa
[56:21] i said the destination is not heaven
[56:25] heaven is part of the itinerary
[56:28] i get problems to pronounce that one
[56:29] itinerary
[56:30] i think i see it wrong in africa
[56:33] heaven is part of the itinerary

[56:37] god's original intent is for us to reign
[56:40] on the earth

[1:06:18] the church of the living god with
[1:06:20] messiah
[1:06:22] with signs wonders miracles that's what
[1:06:24] we're talking about

[1:07:01] emphasis on the mechanics we need to put
[1:07:03] emphasis on the dynamics
[1:07:05] that's what we are doing because we are
[1:07:07] pressing into a position
[1:07:09] that god could say there is my spirit
[1:07:12] flowing freely
[1:07:13] hallelujah pressing the position to
[1:07:15] become a channel of communication with
[1:07:18] god to flow through
[1:07:19] men that are gonna die out
[1:07:21] [Music]
[1:07:22] christ could come alive
[1:07:24] oh glory to god the kingdom is to
[1:07:26] demonstrate the same life same sign same

[1:07:49] believe god for miracles to believe god
[1:07:51] for healing people sell out all the
[1:07:52] things that travel to the brown mutants
[1:07:54] because they're looking for deliverance
[1:07:55] and healing are we going to have that
[1:07:57] kind of meeting once more

[1:08:20] and then pharisees come and say who
[1:08:22] healed you jesus he said no he's a
[1:08:25] sinner he said a man said whether he

[1:12:57] sleeping in the same thing even though
[1:12:59] he faces the same trials even though
[1:13:02] he's having the same tribulation
[1:13:04] he is acting different because he have a

[1:13:42] is the tutors he had back in africa
[1:13:44] is his ability to walk
[1:13:46] oh glory to god to walk upright and all
[1:13:48] the other states walking broken and down
[1:13:50] he's walking with his shoulder up he's

[1:13:54] walking with dignity
[1:13:56] he's walking with grace he is walking
[1:13:58] with humility because he have the
[1:14:00] kingship upon him

[1:15:02] help me here this morning
[1:15:04] oh glory to god glory to god
[1:15:07] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:15:09] hallelujah
[1:15:10] oh my god praise god christ is the head
[1:15:14] of this messiah kingdom
[1:15:17] and you cannot organize a kingdom
[1:15:19] of which christ is the head
[1:15:21] you cannot denominate a kingdom which
[1:15:24] christ is ahead
[1:15:25] because christ is king
[1:15:27] and you cannot take the intellectuals of
[1:15:29] man
[1:15:29] and make an organization to which christ
[1:15:31] will govern
[1:15:32] therefore any companies any peoples any
[1:15:35] groups of men that tries to organize the
[1:15:38] kingdom of god is going contrary to the
[1:15:40] king
[1:15:41] and if they are going contrary to the
[1:15:42] king it will be against the king and if
[1:15:45] it's against the king it will be
[1:15:47] antichrist that's pretty rough
[1:15:49] if i had a more voice i'll make it
[1:15:51] clearer it is antichrist and an
[1:15:54] antichrist spirit tries to take a people
[1:15:57] and call them from organization to
[1:15:58] organization organize them together
[1:16:00] which will never was the will of god
[1:16:02] people has always fostered me because i
[1:16:05] struck so hard an organization it isn't
[1:16:07] the people in there i'm striking up it's
[1:16:09] that dominating spirit
[1:16:12] that makes the people think
[1:16:14] we
[1:16:14] are the people
[1:16:17] so it's a mindset
[1:16:19] that they present upon the people
[1:16:21] thinking that they are it
[1:16:23] they are it and everyone
[1:16:25] must come there
[1:16:26] to be part of it but this kingdom is the
[1:16:30] mystical body
[1:16:31] of jesus christ
[1:16:33] the people in the united kingdom in
[1:16:35] africa and that kingdom and europe and
[1:16:36] that kingdom and america and south
[1:16:38] america all around the world because the
[1:16:40] bible said dawa's redeemed us of thy
[1:16:42] blood out of every nation
[1:16:45] so you can't put anybody in and you
[1:16:48] can't take anybody out but luke 16 16
[1:16:52] said the law and the prophets was until
[1:16:54] john
[1:16:54] and since that time the kingdom is
[1:16:57] preached
[1:16:58] and every man
[1:17:00] come on now
[1:17:01] say it lord
[1:17:03] say it lord say it lord
[1:17:05] every man press their way into it
[1:17:12] [Applause]
[1:17:14] oh
[1:17:15] hallelujah
[1:17:16] no
[1:17:17] they tell the people once they're in the
[1:17:18] message they are it
[1:17:20] that's not what the bible teaches that's
[1:17:22] not what the prophet taught he said hear
[1:17:24] me bring them tamina except you apply
[1:17:26] the token
[1:17:28] you've got to have the token to be in
[1:17:30] the entire message
[1:17:32] not join some church
[1:17:34] people just warmed out of here
[1:17:37] some people
[1:17:40] it's what you want to do
[1:17:42] hallelujah
[1:17:45] oh glory to god amen
[1:17:47] hallelujah
[1:17:48] glory to god
[1:17:50] hallelujah
[1:17:52] glory to god's people is this call of
[1:17:54] people i believed in every denomination
[1:17:57] they could be catholic listen they could
[1:17:59] be protestant
[1:18:00] they could be jewish
[1:18:02] there could be any kind of church but
[1:18:03] the real church is the mystical body of
[1:18:05] jesus christ
[1:18:07] and you cannot organize the mystical
[1:18:10] body of christ
[1:18:12] and every person that comes to christ
[1:18:14] comes out of the world comes into christ
[1:18:16] comes into that mystical body
[1:18:19] is the man right
[1:18:21] and he liking it that parable like
[1:18:22] husband and wife he calls the church the
[1:18:24] bride the bride is no longer bragging is
[1:18:26] no longer two people they're one she's
[1:18:28] flesh of his flesh bone of his bone and
[1:18:29] when a man or woman is called to the
[1:18:32] mystical body of christ by the holy
[1:18:34] spirit they become a full member of his
[1:18:36] body and then they are filled with the
[1:18:38] holy ghost because god took the spirit
[1:18:40] out of christ raise up his body place it
[1:18:42] on his throne and send back listen here
[1:18:44] we go send back the holy spirit to make
[1:18:47] up the mystical body
[1:18:49] of jesus christ that's why the prophet
[1:18:51] said one day the last drop in the pocket
[1:18:53] gonna be finished
[1:18:55] because the spirit was released to make
[1:18:58] up the mystical body
[1:18:59] so every time somebody get baptized is
[1:19:01] one slot taken another slot taken
[1:19:03] another take me one day the last
[1:19:05] name on the book that would take that
[1:19:07] slot
[1:19:08] then that mystical body is complete then
[1:19:10] they're waiting for the head
[1:19:15] are you getting that
[1:19:16] we're talking about bright body but
[1:19:18] here's the head
[1:19:20] then they're waiting for the head and
[1:19:21] the head come like a magnet to take up
[1:19:23] the body
[1:19:24] oh hallelujah are you with me
[1:19:28] we on earth will be magnetized to the
[1:19:29] headstone so when the headstone come
[1:19:32] it's taking up all those who are
[1:19:33] magnetized to it
[1:19:37] so one big headstone magnet gonna be
[1:19:39] sweeping across the world picking up the
[1:19:41] elect that's the rapture
[1:19:43] oh give the lord a shout out
[1:19:46] [Applause]
[1:19:48] praise hallelujah
[1:19:51] that mean you have to have the thing
[1:19:52] inside of you to be taken up
[1:19:54] oh glory to god then this mortal put any
[1:19:57] more talents here this corruption put an
[1:19:59] incorruption we shall be changed
[1:20:02] why the magnet power of the headstone
[1:20:05] the capstone
[1:20:08] [Applause]
[1:20:09] oh glory
[1:20:11] hallelujah
[1:20:13] [Music]
[1:20:15] the kingdom of god is his word made
[1:20:17] power hallelujah
[1:20:22] the kingdom of god
[1:20:25] is
[1:20:27] his word
[1:20:29] made
[1:20:31] power
[1:20:32] say after me would made power
[1:20:35] for all these years a hearing word
[1:20:38] but that would
[1:20:39] have to be me in power
[1:20:42] hallelujah
[1:20:44] this is what brother branham was able to
[1:20:46] do
[1:20:47] demonstrate the power of god
[1:20:50] so he would preach
[1:20:51] and then wait
[1:20:53] and then he said the angel is here
[1:20:56] he's no i represent the faith but we
[1:20:59] have a divine gift
[1:21:00] there was one time that prayer cards
[1:21:02] there
[1:21:03] and a man put a wrong thing you know
[1:21:04] what it was burj george something he put
[1:21:06] on it
[1:21:08] diabetes or some kind of that
[1:21:11] and a man came up in the prayer line
[1:21:12] because the man taught burma was a
[1:21:14] gimmick
[1:21:15] he thought barbara was a fraud
[1:21:17] he thought he was an imposter and
[1:21:18] pushing it so he put some kind of
[1:21:20] contrary disease that he did not have
[1:21:23] and brahms said you're not sick
[1:21:25] he said you put that on the prayer card
[1:21:26] you have it
[1:21:30] right there you got it
[1:21:32] god judge that man right there
[1:21:34] by the time barbara said boy had close
[1:21:36] eyes there's an epileptic spirit there
[1:21:38] trying to cast out be reverent bow ahead
[1:21:40] close your eyes
[1:21:43] a bunch of people keep the eye open
[1:21:45] he begged them
[1:21:47] he pray the spirit leave this person and
[1:21:50] drop them all at them
[1:21:51] all them had it afterwards
[1:21:54] god demands respects
[1:22:00] a woman
[1:22:01] you tell her about a church dressed in
[1:22:02] church whether it is cover whatever it
[1:22:04] is and he said she wouldn't like she
[1:22:05] could take that kind of religion within
[1:22:07] 24 hours she needs hospital dying
[1:22:09] for
[1:22:13] laws
[1:22:14] understand when the king is angry
[1:22:18] you ever hear about the wrath of the
[1:22:20] king
[1:22:21] that's why god had been so angry about a
[1:22:22] man who was speaking his behalf that he
[1:22:24] did not send
[1:22:32] the anger of the king
[1:22:35] the wrath
[1:22:36] of the king is the king you talking
[1:22:39] about
[1:22:42] and i try to bring this today in this
[1:22:44] way because we don't have that concept
[1:22:46] here
[1:22:48] in britain there's a whole big thing the
[1:22:50] only pom-pom manually carried that sir
[1:22:52] them still have characters from liberty
[1:22:54] 14th or 16th or 17th how much do we have
[1:22:58] i think right now there are only certain
[1:22:59] names they could choose for cheating for
[1:23:00] the future and baby baby
[1:23:02] then choose all the cuckoo names
[1:23:04] is that elizabeth or harry william or
[1:23:06] what whatever it is but the certain
[1:23:08] names
[1:23:10] that are confined to
[1:23:12] they can't filter make up a name and say
[1:23:14] you know what chili baby
[1:23:23] you can't do that
[1:23:25] this is royalty
[1:23:28] even jesus get a new
[1:23:31] [Music]

[1:23:35] too
[1:23:36] because it's royalty
[1:23:39] give the lord a shout
[1:23:41] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:23:43] glory to god
[1:23:45] so god wants to promote you but before
[1:23:48] he does he had to get your mind right so
[1:23:50] let's go wrong in adoption a little bit
[1:23:52] yeah but abram's having a child is born
[1:23:54] putting a treat on the governors
[1:23:56] then he says the tutu is what speaks to
[1:23:58] the father
[1:23:59] he said how'd my son come along boy this
[1:24:02] boy is real trouble
[1:24:04] not doing his homework not listening to
[1:24:06] advice not taking console and whatnot
[1:24:08] give him some more time he must be you
[1:24:10] know

[1:24:32] a child you just like everybody else
[1:24:34] and you remain under tutors and
[1:24:36] governors until
[1:24:38] until
[1:24:39] time appointed by the father
[1:24:44] so even though you are son of the king
[1:24:46] you are heir to all things you have to
[1:24:48] wait

[1:26:31] i get to know each other
[1:26:33] that jones minds you know what's going
[1:26:35] to happen there right the bible said
[1:26:37] david lost his head
[1:26:40] you don't do that that that not even
[1:26:41] wise
[1:26:43] david already anointed he knows that
[1:26:45] look what baby said the same day he was
[1:26:46] anointed that he was picked up on soul
[1:26:49] know the cure for that is to bring a man
[1:26:51] who could play well
[1:26:52] bring some music
[1:26:56] so they went to the music classes and
[1:26:58] see who will play the best
[1:27:00] and david was the best
[1:27:03] [Music]
[1:27:05] david playing
[1:27:07] by the throne
[1:27:08] that he was sitting something
[1:27:10] david is walking through the palace that
[1:27:12] he would walk what has happened he
[1:27:13] getting training
[1:27:15] the environment

[1:30:46] word get yourself killed out i'm
[1:30:49] persuaded that many of us friends have
[1:30:51] received the holy ghost but we just
[1:30:53] receive enough holy ghost in us to make
[1:30:55] us to a place where we don't want to lie
[1:30:57] we don't want to steal we don't want to
[1:30:58] do anything but god wants to fill every
[1:31:02] fiber of his church he wants to fill
[1:31:03] your thinking he wants to fill your mind
[1:31:06] he wants to fill every bit of you to
[1:31:08] make you completely dead to yourself to
[1:31:10] your thinking and surrender to the life
[1:31:12] of god that there is word making life
[1:31:14] he said no watch on the bibles in the
[1:31:16] last days there will be churches to

[1:31:45] how do you get into the kingdom the
[1:31:47] kingdom of god is the word of god made

[1:31:55] arising on his son he said another
[1:31:57] message will come that the full maturity
[1:32:00] of the world have turned itself back
[1:32:03] again into power
[1:32:04] the full maturity of the world has
[1:32:08] turned itself back into power
[1:32:10] therefore i know power going to be
[1:32:12] released
[1:32:13] because it is promised
[1:32:15] i don't have to work up about it i'd
[1:32:17] have to try and say oh like you're
[1:32:19] trying to manufacture something
[1:32:21] the fish though don't try to say i'm
[1:32:22] taking a deep breath
[1:32:25] the fish swims
[1:32:27] because it's built in
[1:32:29] the buddha run like
[1:32:30] run a high rate that just to take off
[1:32:32] the bird just flies because it's built
[1:32:35] in the power is built in
[1:32:38] that word there's something built into

[1:32:44] hallelujah
[1:32:46] glory to god amen are you with me
[1:32:49] hallelujah
[1:32:50] praise be to jesus
[1:32:52] here where i want to get to
[1:32:54] who praised god as the head
[1:32:57] was took from the grave
[1:32:59] so the body must fall in back to eden
[1:33:02] watch where the head of the family the
[1:33:04] man
[1:33:05] the bridegroom the bride being the body
[1:33:08] of the bride remember the brain is the
[1:33:11] body called the church
[1:33:14] amen
[1:33:15] he is the head of the church
[1:33:17] therefore the head of the body but the
[1:33:20] bride is the body
[1:33:21] call the church
[1:33:22] not this physical thing that man-made
[1:33:25] thing not that
[1:33:26] the mystical body
[1:33:28] that's the real church
[1:33:30] he's upon his rock i will build my
[1:33:31] church not some pastor bill some church
[1:33:33] he promised to build his church oh glory
[1:33:35] to god and the gates of hell can't touch
[1:33:38] that
[1:33:38] wrestle with it but i can't overcome it
[1:33:40] so therefore that rock that he put
[1:33:42] inside of there he placed in your soul
[1:33:44] before the foundation of the world he
[1:33:46] put a gene inside of you he put a seed
[1:33:49] inside of you you couldn't help but come
[1:33:51] to this message you couldn't help but
[1:33:53] respond to the voice of god in the last
[1:33:56] days
[1:33:57] oh glory to god because then you had
[1:34:00] that gene
[1:34:02] that thought
[1:34:04] [Applause]
[1:34:05] glory to god
[1:34:07] that thought
[1:34:09] must be expressed
[1:34:11] and a word is a thought expressed so you
[1:34:13] were in the thoughts of god oh glory
[1:34:17] you might be seated you're in the back
[1:34:18] part of elohim's mind
[1:34:20] you were part of his thinking
[1:34:22] when he spoke he spoke for you
[1:34:25] glory to god amen
[1:34:27] hallelujah you may be seated so when you
[1:34:30] came forth he is no longer elohim he is
[1:34:33] jehovah
[1:34:34] one with his family
[1:34:36] is finally time
[1:34:37] we going back to eden but when the book
[1:34:40] came down he had to produce evidence
[1:34:42] that the book is unearthed we have to
[1:34:44] see evidence that the book is on the
[1:34:47] earth and but abraham said son come on
[1:34:49] and shine four days
[1:34:51] proving the same god that was with
[1:34:53] joshua that says son stand still
[1:34:56] that god is alive
[1:34:58] [Applause]
[1:35:02] oh glory to god
[1:35:05] my god
[1:35:08] you understand that
[1:35:09] brother branham was reflecting kingdom
[1:35:11] dominion
[1:35:12] and kingdom authority because the bible
[1:35:15] said we shall have dominion over the
[1:35:17] fish over the sea over every creeping
[1:35:19] thing
[1:35:20] so when that dead fish is a little fishy
[1:35:22] i give you back your life
[1:35:25] he was demonstrating dominion over the
[1:35:28] flesh
[1:35:29] to make another death itself
[1:35:31] oh give the lord a shout and pray
[1:35:33] oh hallelujah
[1:35:35] power over the element
[1:35:38] hallelujah power over nature
[1:35:42] power over the beast
[1:35:44] so god make him confront a killer bull
[1:35:45] you may be seated
[1:35:47] a beast of the field
[1:35:48] he forget his gun
[1:35:50] he said if he had his gun human he was
[1:35:52] gonna shoot the ball and pay for the
[1:35:54] ball
[1:35:55] but that gun was forgotten
[1:35:57] human
[1:35:58] that he don't have to rely upon human he
[1:36:00] had to rely upon divine
[1:36:02] then something happened something came
[1:36:04] over him he said bull you spoke to the
[1:36:07] bull it wasn't the words
[1:36:10] it was what came over him
[1:36:13] i'm not hearing you
[1:36:15] hallelujah
[1:36:16] something gonna come over you
[1:36:19] mary asked the question how shall this
[1:36:22] be
[1:36:23] he said the holy ghost going to come
[1:36:26] over you
[1:36:27] and you're going to produce the messiah
[1:36:29] something's going to come over you
[1:36:32] i believe it's here this morning
[1:36:34] the dynamics is here
[1:36:36] the holy ghost is here
[1:36:38] [Applause]
[1:36:42] glory
[1:36:44] glory
[1:36:45] glory
[1:36:46] glory
[1:36:48] oh glory
[1:36:49] rub your sleepy eyes
[1:36:51] wake up inside of here
[1:36:52] oh glory to god
[1:36:54] we have received a kingdom
[1:37:00] glory to god
[1:37:02] my god you may be seated
[1:37:04] the word was lost through the ages the
[1:37:07] prophet said it took seven angels to
[1:37:10] gather all the scattered word and tied
[1:37:12] back into the word to bring down the
[1:37:14] holy ghost heaven consists of the word
[1:37:17] so the kingdom of god had to come down
[1:37:19] to the earth as the word of god and the
[1:37:22] mystery of god comes strong from god as
[1:37:24] the word of god to reveal god to the
[1:37:26] people so god couldn't send the kingdom
[1:37:28] of spirit because we wasn't ready yet if
[1:37:31] the spirit came are we not ready we end
[1:37:33] up like pentecostals but god didn't want
[1:37:36] that he want the same life same signs
[1:37:39] same wonders same miracles same what
[1:37:42] same life
[1:37:43] [Applause]
[1:37:44] then because they had the gifts but not
[1:37:46] the life because the lives come by the
[1:37:48] word and the word come to the prophet
[1:37:50] and they reject the prophet
[1:37:51] [Applause]
[1:37:52] so that they couldn't go on to be
[1:37:54] adopted sons
[1:37:57] nice big pentecostal ministries and
[1:37:58] ministries and healing and signing
[1:38:00] wonders but not to be abducted sons
[1:38:02] because the doctor's son signed the
[1:38:03] check
[1:38:05] just like the father
[1:38:07] that's why you say when you see me
[1:38:08] [Music]
[1:38:09] you see the father
[1:38:11] don't even ask about the father
[1:38:13] oh hallelujah my signature just as good
[1:38:17] hallelujah just tell me how much how
[1:38:19] much you're right how much a sign on
[1:38:20] that check my signature just as good if
[1:38:23] i say higher you were hired if i said
[1:38:25] five you are fine oh glory to god i'm
[1:38:27] gonna adopt the son the father said hear
[1:38:29] ye him don't even bother with me hear
[1:38:32] him
[1:38:32] oh glory to god my voice is in him my
[1:38:35] word is in him my power in him my
[1:38:38] kingdom is in him
[1:38:44] my god i'm in the spirit now
[1:38:47] now we can understand what jesus said
[1:38:49] whatever you're buying on earth
[1:38:51] it's born in heaven whatever we do on
[1:38:53] earth reflect it in heaven because god
[1:38:56] brought heaven down to the earth he
[1:38:58] wanted earth to reflect what was in
[1:39:01] heaven that's why he put man here to
[1:39:03] bring god to the earth to bring god to
[1:39:06] man
[1:39:07] and the word was become flesh and dwell
[1:39:09] among us oh give the lord a shout of
[1:39:11] praise
[1:39:13] oh
[1:39:14] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:39:16] oh glory to god
[1:39:18] oh praise god
[1:39:20] so brother branham he said on as long as
[1:39:22] you are pregnant
[1:39:24] with the same word which is his body you
[1:39:27] have took his body
[1:39:28] become in him and when you took the word
[1:39:31] not the creed
[1:39:32] therefore here we go
[1:39:34] are you ready
[1:39:35] that's why
[1:39:36] we seem so contrary to everything else
[1:39:39] yes what
[1:39:40] people
[1:39:41] get problems with me quoting
[1:39:43] they still complain about that channel
[1:39:45] i ain't no preacher that is true
[1:39:47] i'm a coach i'm a reader
[1:39:48] i'm an inspired reader
[1:39:51] hallelujah
[1:39:53] but all i know the spoken word
[1:39:56] is original seed
[1:39:57] so i prefer to stay with the spoken word
[1:40:00] i prefer to preach the spoken word
[1:40:02] i read the frame what i say by the word
[1:40:04] itself so here we go
[1:40:06] the body don't fail to get this brother
[1:40:08] said the body therefore
[1:40:10] cannot
[1:40:12] recognize
[1:40:13] any hatred but the word
[1:40:17] so the bride body guy recognize those
[1:40:18] headquarters
[1:40:20] in europe in america south america
[1:40:22] africa there's no headquarters to
[1:40:23] recognize
[1:40:25] the pope have that
[1:40:27] as barajan was saying in africa mr
[1:40:29] francis
[1:40:35] the catholics have mr francis
[1:40:37] in the headquarters in rome
[1:40:39] francis is like a rock star right now
[1:40:41] were you waiting for mr francis in
[1:40:42] america
[1:40:44] but we have jesus
[1:40:47] as our king
[1:40:49] [Applause]
[1:40:51] and we are about to demonstrate what
[1:40:53] kingdom we are

[1:43:05] in that drama when he is seen from the
[1:43:07] natural it looked like so much pressure

[1:44:08] morning
[1:44:09] he was high up
[1:44:11] until he got lifted up in pride and said
[1:44:13] i'll be as the most high i want some

[1:50:55] he took their fishing ability and said
[1:50:57] you know what i will take a skill to
[1:50:58] next level
[1:50:59] is that a catching fish you catch men
[1:51:02] but you have to get the gospel
[1:51:04] get the good news you have to preach the
[1:51:06] kingdom
[1:51:07] so he send these guys to preach the
[1:51:09] kingdom to catch other men
[1:51:11] because it was the spirit of god coming
[1:51:13] back to get back adams
[1:51:15] take it back sons
[1:51:16] the spirit of god haunting the elect
[1:51:19] so jesus one man called 12 and that 12
[1:51:23] grew
[1:51:24] and then it called 120 in the upper room
[1:51:27] spirit baptized them and then it grew
[1:51:29] tree toes and added
[1:51:31] what was god doing his spirit is now
[1:51:33] going through all the earth to gather up
[1:51:36] the elect
[1:51:38] hallelujah
[1:51:39] hallelujah
[1:51:41] when the jews finally turn it down paul
[1:51:43] turned he said turn to the gentiles they
[1:51:46] don't want it i tuned this way god
[1:51:48] ordained that
[1:51:49] the jews got blinded that paul could
[1:51:51] take the gospel to the gentiles
[1:51:53] hallelujah then the match for the
[1:51:55] gentiles is on well we have had seven
[1:51:57] ages
[1:51:58] of gentiles
[1:52:00] and we come to the end of the age before
[1:52:02] judgment strike god say behold i send
[1:52:04] you elijah the prophet
[1:52:06] oh hallelujah we coming to the end of
[1:52:08] the gentile dispensation as god about to
[1:52:10] go back to the jews oh hallelujah oh
[1:52:13] glory to god oh i'm almost done
[1:52:15] hallelujah praise god
[1:52:18] listen to the part that touch me there
[1:52:20] for the body here we go cannot recognize
[1:52:23] any of the headship
[1:52:24] but the headship of the world
[1:52:26] here we go are you ready
[1:52:28] then our hatchet is a kingdom
[1:52:30] [Applause]
[1:52:32] and the kingdom is within you
[1:52:34] the bible said we are not a denomination
[1:52:36] we belong to a kingdom and the kingdom
[1:52:38] is the word of god made spirit and life
[1:52:41] in your own life bringing to pass every
[1:52:43] promise in this day as it is in that day
[1:52:46] when the word and god was won
[1:52:48] oh hallelujah praise the name of the
[1:52:52] lord so god said go into all the world
[1:52:54] and preach the gospel then he meant go
[1:52:56] to all the world and demonstrate the
[1:52:59] power of god to every creature
[1:53:01] in order to preach the gospel here we go
[1:53:04] this is a bomb
[1:53:05] before you can make it a gospel preach
[1:53:09] amen
[1:53:11] so the kingdom must be preached right
[1:53:12] yes but before
[1:53:14] you can make it gospel preach
[1:53:17] you have got to have
[1:53:18] the power and demonstration of the holy
[1:53:21] spirit to prove the gospel
[1:53:23] the letter kill it but the spirit make
[1:53:25] it life
[1:53:26] so the gospel is not really the gospel
[1:53:29] until it comes with power
[1:53:30] [Music]
[1:53:31] so we have a promise of power
[1:53:33] that is what you're looking for
[1:53:36] your own inheritance your own power
[1:53:39] virtue to come into your being
[1:53:41] how to fill your spirit
[1:53:44] that is what you make in preparation for
[1:53:46] oh glory to god hallelujah blessed be
[1:53:49] the name of the lord hallelujah praise
[1:53:52] god isn't that right
[1:53:54] glory to god after the seed in you that
[1:53:57] seventh under seed in you is crying for
[1:53:59] the life
[1:54:01] of second peter 1 427 that you can have
[1:54:03] a living faith and living virtue and
[1:54:05] living knowledge we wanted to live
[1:54:07] it must be manifested
[1:54:09] and tested
[1:54:12] did you get that
[1:54:14] it must be manifested and tested and
[1:54:16] then it's proven to be inside the idea
[1:54:18] oh hallelujah praise god amen okay
[1:54:23] here we go
[1:54:24] praise god hallelujah did you know that
[1:54:27] men that are sons of god are amateur
[1:54:29] gods
[1:54:31] god said they were gods because they had
[1:54:32] full domain over dominion of the world
[1:54:35] he gave them dominion over all things
[1:54:36] but he lost his godship he lost his
[1:54:38] sonship he lost his domain and satan
[1:54:41] took it over
[1:54:42] but brother we are waiting
[1:54:45] for the manifestation of the sons of god
[1:54:47] who will come and take it back over
[1:54:48] again
[1:54:50] so this is the prophecy
[1:54:52] we are waiting for kingdom sons
[1:54:54] sons will come into position to know who
[1:54:56] they are
[1:54:57] who know the father is waiting for the
[1:54:59] fullness of time when the pyramid gets
[1:55:01] to the top where the full sons of god
[1:55:04] will be manifested
[1:55:06] when the pyramid gets
[1:55:08] to the top
[1:55:09] isn't that right
[1:55:11] god wanted to place his church sons and
[1:55:13] daughters god help live to see me see it
[1:55:16] is my prayer so close till i could feel
[1:55:18] it with my hands almost that's what i've
[1:55:20] longed to see waiting for the time when
[1:55:22] walked down the street the earlier
[1:55:23] crippled lane there from the mother's
[1:55:25] womb silva and gold having none waiting
[1:55:27] for the manifestation of the sons of god
[1:55:29] when god will make himself known they
[1:55:31] would stop sickness they would stop
[1:55:32] cancer they would stop diseases you
[1:55:34] think can say something the bible said
[1:55:36] they come at a time when men will rot in
[1:55:38] their flesh and the buzzers will eat off
[1:55:41] their carcasses before they even die
[1:55:42] kansas are two take to what's coming but
[1:55:44] remember that horrible thing was
[1:55:46] forbidden in that day to touch those who
[1:55:48] were the seal of god and that's what we
[1:55:50] are striving for now to get in here we
[1:55:52] go that's where the inspiration comes
[1:55:54] from we are striving to get in and be
[1:55:56] positionally placed into the kingdom of
[1:55:59] god before these horrible plagues strike
[1:56:02] you have no time to be a church member
[1:56:04] jesus remember we'll get you the
[1:56:05] tribulation hallelujah the thing you're
[1:56:07] the strife force to get into the kingdom
[1:56:09] of god i want to put that as a burden
[1:56:11] upon you i want to be in that kingdom
[1:56:13] i want to be part of that kingdom people
[1:56:15] are caught up in church the ministers
[1:56:17] that make the church so nice and churchy
[1:56:19] and the history and all what they're
[1:56:20] going through and all that said that
[1:56:22] drama and whatnot all the people know
[1:56:23] his church there's nobody pastor he lied
[1:56:26] he writes everything about it all you
[1:56:28] know his church but the kingdom they
[1:56:30] don't know anything about that and
[1:56:32] that's what jesus came to introduce the
[1:56:33] kingdom
[1:56:34] of god hallelujah are you with me praise
[1:56:38] be to god
[1:56:39] hallelujah
[1:56:41] it's a king it's a spiritual kingdom
[1:56:43] isn't that right and i'm talking about
[1:56:45] the approach praise god to this new
[1:56:47] birth approach to the birth he said you
[1:56:49] cannot go to the same process you can't
[1:56:50] go to the same way at thinking he said
[1:56:52] to get this born again you have to
[1:56:54] change your thinking you have to change
[1:56:56] your way you and you know what i
[1:56:57] realized whatever you tolerate you don't
[1:57:00] change
[1:57:02] you see people are tired of themselves
[1:57:04] and your ways
[1:57:05] you haven't come to a dead end yet
[1:57:06] whatever you tolerate you're still
[1:57:07] allowed because you're tolerating it but
[1:57:10] if you get angry
[1:57:11] and you say you know this enough is
[1:57:13] enough i want a change in my life
[1:57:15] this is it
[1:57:16] it will change
[1:57:18] because you had enough of you
[1:57:20] you had enough of you
[1:57:22] you come like job i hate myself people
[1:57:24] don't talk that kind of way but that is
[1:57:25] when you come to the spot
[1:57:27] [Applause]
[1:57:29] glory
[1:57:30] that's what jacob come through jacob
[1:57:32] jacob was wealthy
[1:57:34] and he had to go back to meet his
[1:57:35] brother he got horrors
[1:57:37] he sent his wife one way family one way
[1:57:38] and jacob was caught all alone
[1:57:40] then he met the angel the angel wanted
[1:57:42] him alone because when you're with the
[1:57:44] crowd you get drifting with the people
[1:57:47] god can't get you alone
[1:57:49] that's why the gentile is individual you
[1:57:52] can't lean on your mother revelation
[1:57:53] father husband wife revelation you have
[1:57:55] to get your own revelation
[1:57:57] so when jacob was caught alone he began
[1:57:59] to wrestle with the angel
[1:58:00] he had one talk changed me
[1:58:07] that's all
[1:58:09] change me
[1:58:10] and he rest and he's holding on because
[1:58:11] this is where his blessings at
[1:58:14] give me a scripture luke 16 16 the
[1:58:16] kingdom of god is preaching every man
[1:58:18] press their way into it so here it is
[1:58:20] jacob rasmuth angel for what a blessing
[1:58:22] he wants his life change
[1:58:24] he don't want to testimony ah i touch
[1:58:26] the angel i come back senator testimony
[1:58:28] i touch the angel
[1:58:29] and your work is the same
[1:58:31] you're talking the same you don't want
[1:58:33] to touch the angel you want to touch you
[1:58:35] [Music]
[1:58:37] so jacob jacob wrestled all night long
[1:58:40] all night long that man was desperate
[1:58:43] because you see when you are desperate
[1:58:45] you can't let that injure go
[1:58:47] the angel wanted to go he said go let me
[1:58:48] go it's coming morning he said where you
[1:58:50] going
[1:58:51] i will not let you go till you bless me
[1:58:55] hallelujah then the angel touch him
[1:58:57] then he started walk different
[1:58:59] i couldn't walk with that bump no more
[1:59:00] you gotta walk with a limp now
[1:59:02] you don't look like a little old man now
[1:59:04] you had to walk a little different now
[1:59:06] hallelujah you had to walk a little
[1:59:07] different now you gotta take it easy
[1:59:09] when you're young you're feeling strong
[1:59:10] when you're young you want to do it well
[1:59:11] everything you want to do but when
[1:59:13] you're getting in the wall it's a
[1:59:13] different kind of thing so jacob walking
[1:59:15] down all the fear leave him now he ain't
[1:59:17] fear the brother because he got the fear
[1:59:19] of god upon him now you see when you
[1:59:21] conquer with god
[1:59:23] you end bother with man
[1:59:25] when centuries overcome the devil no
[1:59:26] willingness what man could stop him
[1:59:28] doing that he said go tell that fox
[1:59:29] tomorrow cast our devils praise god my
[1:59:31] always not yet come
[1:59:33] you can't stop me i called for this
[1:59:34] thing
[1:59:35] oh glory save this hallelujah give the
[1:59:37] lord some praises
[1:59:39] that's when a man encounter god
[1:59:41] it takes away fear of men
[1:59:43] the ministers association the boys the
[1:59:45] fivefold fall whoever in the fall take
[1:59:48] away from all of them praise god
[1:59:50] hallelujah who think that the angel and
[1:59:52] the ancient angel oh glory to god
[1:59:54] hallelujah are people going to run from
[1:59:55] us you know oh yes when they see us come
[1:59:57] on they will flee
[1:59:59] praise god hallelujah praise god when
[2:00:02] they say yeah yeah they're going to flee
[2:00:03] you know one time jesus went someplace
[2:00:05] and there was a christ say holy please
[2:00:08] because they recognize him come on now
[2:00:10] you don't understand what i'm saying the
[2:00:11] people the people see jesus but the
[2:00:14] devil seeing the king is wrong
[2:00:17] when the kings are wrong when the lands
[2:00:19] are wrong everybody is shut up called
[2:00:20] the land of the tribe by judah when that
[2:00:22] land anointing come everybody just shut
[2:00:24] up and that's what god's going to
[2:00:26] produce the land right but judah this
[2:00:28] bible is so annoying nothing will stop
[2:00:29] this bride
[2:00:30] fear no king fear no commandment fear
[2:00:33] nothing
[2:00:34] oh glory to god hallelujah you
[2:00:36] understand what is going to be like
[2:00:38] elijah walker didn't say not even to a
[2:00:40] rain will fall i called for it i shut
[2:00:42] the heavens up that's a man with power
[2:00:44] that's a moment of authority that's the
[2:00:46] gospel
[2:00:48] but just as elijah could shut up the
[2:00:49] heavens another man could unlock the
[2:00:51] heavens
[2:00:53] and say let it rain or give the lord a
[2:00:56] shout of praise inside of here
[2:00:58] oh
[2:01:00] hallelujah hallelujah oh glory to god
[2:01:02] glory to god glory
[2:01:04] [Applause]
[2:01:06] so when our church has grown in
[2:01:08] under the persecution of the outside
[2:01:09] world
[2:01:10] believing on the lord jesus
[2:01:12] that the promise of the holy ghost is
[2:01:14] just as real to us
[2:01:15] as it was the pentecost
[2:01:17] how they grown and crying their labor
[2:01:18] pains but when they are born
[2:01:21] and positionally born
[2:01:23] ephraim even
[2:01:25] then god set in the church
[2:01:27] apostles and prophets
[2:01:29] and teachers and evangelists
[2:01:31] started with a man lots of money lots of
[2:01:34] big things that's the popularity all
[2:01:36] these things are dead to the believer
[2:01:38] we don't care
[2:01:40] a tent or cottage
[2:01:41] live or die i think what wrong this is
[2:01:43] the thing i'm interested in the kingdom
[2:01:46] of god
[2:01:47] whether i maintain my home whether i
[2:01:50] maintain my family
[2:01:53] whether i maintain whatever it is let me
[2:01:55] maintain christ
[2:01:58] the hope of glory
[2:02:00] build me upon the lord into this let
[2:02:01] christ be my head
[2:02:03] that's looking to me on my foundation my
[2:02:05] feet that's in him let virtue knowledge
[2:02:08] temperance patience godliness burly
[2:02:10] kindness work in me oh lord is my prayer
[2:02:12] i don't care live or die sing or drone
[2:02:14] denomination no no mission friend no
[2:02:15] friend let that work in me let christ
[2:02:18] virtue his knowledge flow out
[2:02:20] that i might be able to teach those for
[2:02:22] god has set in the church apostles and
[2:02:24] prophets and teachers and pastors and
[2:02:25] evangelists all for the perfecting and
[2:02:28] bringing all these virtues into it
[2:02:31] how could the ministers bring the
[2:02:32] virtues into the people if they
[2:02:34] themselves don't have the virtues
[2:02:37] these men were filled with the virtues
[2:02:40] but abraham had the virtues
[2:02:42] he had the life of christ in him
[2:02:45] they asked him a question brother
[2:02:46] branham how come you could go to all
[2:02:48] these different churches and they don't
[2:02:49] believe what you believe you say hoping
[2:02:50] someday knowledge to know what they
[2:02:51] believe temperance patience with him is
[2:02:54] the virtues inside of him
[2:02:56] this is what these brothers had they had
[2:02:58] no argument with men
[2:03:00] they did what it's supposed to do and
[2:03:02] what they published
[2:03:03] isn't that right
[2:03:05] oh glory to god blessed be
[2:03:08] so but watch it when you surrender your
[2:03:10] complete being when the holy then the
[2:03:12] holy spirit just pours through you in
[2:03:15] these virtues as a living tabernacle
[2:03:18] listen here we go i'm almost done
[2:03:21] then the people would look out and say
[2:03:22] that's a man full of virtue knowledge he
[2:03:25] believes the word temperance patience
[2:03:28] godliness brotherly kindness he's full
[2:03:29] of love of the holy ghost there he is
[2:03:31] what in the wrong a statue that
[2:03:33] unbelievers can look at and say there is
[2:03:36] a christian
[2:03:37] that's why i see people in messages
[2:03:39] they're not christians other are not
[2:03:41] christians they are message believers
[2:03:45] they believe prophet
[2:03:46] they believe ghosts
[2:03:48] christians have a christian
[2:03:50] christian is to be christ-like
[2:03:54] not the people in your church to
[2:03:56] everyone
[2:04:07] when a man possesses this all these
[2:04:09] virtues
[2:04:10] then the capstone comes down and seals
[2:04:13] them into the kingdom of god
[2:04:16] which is the holy ghost so on top of
[2:04:18] faith virtue knowledge temperance
[2:04:19] brother kindness you get holy spirit
[2:04:21] come and seal the whole thing but
[2:04:23] charity and paul call it the bond of
[2:04:25] perfectness
[2:04:26] then there's no leaks in your building
[2:04:29] nothing leaking out anymore you are
[2:04:31] sealed
[2:04:32] and you become a living monument
[2:04:36] you go in some of these countries you
[2:04:38] always see some bronze statue
[2:04:42] you're asking who is that there's a man
[2:04:43] some low general and whatever what can i
[2:04:45] start you so hold on some statue of this
[2:04:47] man kitchener statue this one statue
[2:04:49] that's at you
[2:04:50] them statues are dead
[2:04:53] you can't talk to that
[2:04:54] but then when you are sealed you become
[2:04:56] a living monument
[2:04:59] a living statue
[2:05:00] a statue that could walk and talk
[2:05:02] in other words you come back to
[2:05:04] eden satan in trouble because you you
[2:05:08] and satan eaten but you and your eden
[2:05:11] with dominion and authority those devils
[2:05:13] that cry out and move out of your way as
[2:05:15] you pass you have police escort
[2:05:19] natural government are blue lights you
[2:05:21] have angel likes
[2:05:23] satan know you coming because he said he
[2:05:25] enters in front
[2:05:26] royalty coming
[2:05:28] royalty don't drive alone there are
[2:05:29] people in front of people behind
[2:05:31] security in front secret inside
[2:05:35] [Applause]
[2:05:36] so after a while the angel coming to
[2:05:38] clarity wait for you
[2:05:41] because the angels are servants but you
[2:05:43] are sons
[2:05:47] come on now

[2:05:51] oh hallelujah
[2:05:53] oh praise the name of the lord
[2:05:55] glory
[2:05:57] to be born of the spirit
[2:05:59] is to believe and behave yourself in the
[2:06:02] spirit
[2:06:03] is to understand and believe with your
[2:06:05] heart
[2:06:06] that jesus is the christ
[2:06:08] this is his word
[2:06:10] and no other words can be added or taken
[2:06:12] from it
[2:06:13] without your name being taken out of the
[2:06:15] book of life
[2:06:17] that is a strong one
[2:06:19] that's a strong one
[2:06:21] to be born means to be booted from above
[2:06:24] right isn't that right
[2:06:26] you have to be born from up here to be
[2:06:28] born again then that kingdom is so much
[2:06:31] higher than this kingdom
[2:06:33] till this kingdom is foolish to that all
[2:06:35] right so afterwards the world become
[2:06:37] foolish to you
[2:06:38] you truly become a stranger
[2:06:41] and a pilgrim
