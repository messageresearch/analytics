[42:18] any big human dignitary here just to
[42:20] know the Lord Of Glory is in our midst
[42:22] amen the spirit is here this is a
[42:25] encouragement testimony here de brother
[42:28] ID I found myself continue to think
[42:30] about the last several weeks the forever
[42:32] lifechanging testimony that the Lord has
[42:34] left behind us in brother Chandler but
[42:37] Isaac's
[42:38] preaching uh two services in Miami which
[42:41] s to me like Revelation 4:5 out of the
[42:43] throne proceed Lightnings and Tong and
[42:45] voices and the services of Correction
[42:47] and instruction recently received from
[42:49] the Lord I feel very humbled and
[42:51] grateful to be a partaker of all these
[42:52] great old points of Love grace and mercy
[42:55] from the Lord that we have received
[42:58] when our daughter L started medical
[42:59] school she said so much was being poured
[43:02] into them as students it was like
[43:03] drinking from a firose I have felt much
[43:06] the same way in the last several weeks
[43:08] the Lord has poured us gushes upon us
[43:10] I'm so grateful God bless you brother
[43:12] kis giving God praise
[43:17] amen and you may not know this many
[43:19] times I go back home and in
[43:23] awe and wonder as to what happens to
[43:26] this
[43:27] uh many times I get stuff and I don't
[43:29] know how we're going to just connect
[43:31] together and right behind the pulpit
[43:33] here I see all the connections like like
[43:35] as plain as ever and I am astonished I'm
[43:39] astonished as if I'm not the preacher
[43:41] I'm astonished if I'm sitting on hearing
[43:43] when I listen back I hear it and I know
[43:45] it's the Lord and this is a testimony
[43:48] you know sister she got a like a mini
[43:50] stroke and she sent this to me morning
[43:52] blessings brother ID I saw the neurolog
[43:55] the neurologist on Monday he didn't
[43:57] mention how fortunate I am to experience
[44:00] no complication of the stroke as he
[44:02] explained the magnitude of such Strokes
[44:05] I know it is nothing but God while you
[44:08] were praying for me a calm came over me
[44:12] and I too be to praise God starting
[44:14] telling everyone that this experience is
[44:17] so that God would be glorified and as I
[44:19] was reading the book of John on on two
[44:22] occasions the blind man healed and
[44:25] Lazarus raised from the dead Jesus said
[44:27] these things happen that God would be
[44:29] glorified and God used you to speak
[44:32] directly into it glory after prayer the
[44:35] pressure immediately started going down
[44:38] from 170 over 120 to 147 over 95 God was
[44:42] indeed glorified as some doctors said
[44:45] this could never be a stroke but an
[44:47] allergy during this period I've never I
[44:50] was never afraid or even I even enjoyed
[44:53] my stay at hospital testifying that I am
[44:55] well by God's grace
[44:57] and that God will be glorified and God
[45:00] did keep his word Monday's examination
[45:03] of the city scan report showed I had a
[45:05] previous stroke when the doc believes
[45:08] that it could have been a result of my
[45:09] covid episode but my sleep app and my
[45:12] sleep apneia which can put a lot of
[45:14] stress on the body God is good all the
[45:17] time my sensory system is intact my Moto
[45:20] system is a bit weak a slight weakness
[45:22] as noted in my right Upper Limb even it
[45:25] is not affecting me in any way
[45:27] I do experience anxious moments now and
[45:30] I guess thinking about strokes but I'm
[45:32] trying to relax and continue reading
[45:35] God's word intermittent mild headaches
[45:38] like things are noted today I'm having
[45:40] some therapy at the seaside nature God
[45:43] thank you very much for continuing
[45:45] Allowing God to use you to be a blessing
[45:46] to my family and I blessing to you the
[45:48] family also sister Don giving God praise
[45:58] so this morning we have a special tape
[45:59] we like to share with you it's a tape I

[46:04] funeral and brother U had preached the
[46:05] Sunday after that and at the end of it
[46:08] the family played a clip of what was at
[46:10] the gravide and so like but the family
[46:12] there about a six minute clip you'll see
[46:14] that also but brother the old preacher

[46:25] everybody and he wants wants everybody
[46:27] to love him you know sometime people
[46:29] don't see God as a person they see God
[46:31] as a being but God is a person that
[46:35] loves that talk I'm a jealous God he
[46:39] cares he he's merciful he's a person and
[46:43] he wants us to praise him he want us to
[46:45] repent he want us to get our hearts
[46:47] right because he want to bless us he
[46:48] cannot bless us outside of his laws okay
[46:51] so Christ loves everybody he wants
[46:53] everybody to love him and this is his
[46:55] kindness to you that you might love him
[46:58] and believe him and have faith in his
[47:00] finished work for you now if you had an
[47:03] artisian well blowing out water on the
[47:05] hill and you had crop burning up now you
[47:07] could stand on the hill with the Crouch
[47:09] is and holler Great Well Spring your
[47:11] water over to me and water my crop so I
[47:13] can have food you could holler until you
[47:15] could holler no more it won't act if
[47:17] you'll work according to the laws of
[47:20] gravitation you can bring the water
[47:22] right down to your crop that there's
[47:24] enough electricity in any room to light
[47:26] it up but you can't holler great
[47:28] electricity I'm conscious of you are
[47:29] here light up this room no you've got to
[47:32] work according to the laws of
[47:34] electricity and then it's light up the
[47:35] room and it's the same way it is we are
[47:38] conscious that God is here God doesn't
[47:42] heal the people just by going to church
[47:44] or making confession he heals you up on
[47:47] your faith in his finished work that's
[47:50] the only basis that he can heal you and
[47:53] if you believe that it's not a bunch of
[47:55] ministers hands the touch of a
[47:57] Minister's hands it's not the anointing
[47:59] of the oil it's not the prayer that he
[48:01] pray so much it is your fate to accept
[48:05] the finished work that Christ did for
[48:07] you so when you look at it if you could
[48:09] fix yourself and you could fix your mix
[48:11] you don't need
[48:14] Jesus let me say it again if you could
[48:17] fix yourself you don't need the Lord we
[48:21] come because we need him to fix us we
[48:25] have a problem not him
[48:28] we need him as a savior we need him as a
[48:30] deliverer we need him so our confession
[48:34] is not in our strength and our human
[48:36] will and our ability no our confession
[48:39] is in God who could keep and preserve
[48:44] us do you believe that I could go down
[48:48] deep inside there Romans 7 talk about
[48:50] Paul say what I would not what I don't
[48:52] want to do that's what I find myself
[48:53] doing and what not and I find inside of
[48:56] me law in other words the law the mind
[48:59] having a thought of what is right
[49:01] doesn't make you do
[49:03] right thinking about the right things
[49:06] doesn't make you do the right things
[49:08] that's your thoughts God have to come
[49:10] and make an operation in your heart and
[49:13] that causes you to do the right
[49:15] thing your father tell you your mother
[49:18] tell you the preacher tell you and what
[49:19] not you still be still misbehaving
[49:21] because there the human mind you're
[49:22] talking about a the heart is is is
[49:25] sinful and who could know but God God
[49:27] but when God turns the operation in your
[49:29] heart and life then you will love what
[49:31] he loves and hate what he
[49:33] hates then you become a a lover of God
[49:37] hallelujah you love the ways of God you
[49:40] love the things of God you love the word
[49:42] of God in God you get strength in God
[49:45] you get your
[49:48] Energizer
[49:50] Hallelujah glory to God so when you're
[49:52] leaning on things and God move that prop
[49:55] from under you then you fall you was
[49:57] leaning on that that what happened to
[49:58] Isaiah and King Uzziah and God had to
[50:01] remove that prop from him because he
[50:02] doesn't want anybody propping you up you
[50:04] must rest upon God suppose God take away
[50:07] your wife suppose God take away your
[50:09] husband suppose God take away your
[50:11] mother your father your brother your
[50:12] sister whoever your little child what do
[50:15] you
[50:18] do you see there still storm coming

[51:32] church for to get a whift of what is
[51:35] coming and get an inspiration how can we
[51:38] prepare because the Bible said his wife
[51:40] had made herself ready in other words
[51:41] how his wife got into the preparation
[51:43] mode and got prepared and God was made
[51:45] ready oh give the Lord some Praises

[51:51] there's one door to peace my peace I
[51:53] give to you he's only one door of
[51:54] genuine peace he says now uh you might
[51:58] accumulate enough money to get your
[51:59] children clothes have food to eat you
[52:02] might have accumulated enough popularity
[52:04] to be popular among the people but when
[52:06] you slip off your shoes at night and get
[52:09] ready to lay down there's only one thing
[52:11] can give you peace that is if you know
[52:15] how you are dying that night there's
[52:17] only one piece and Jesus is the peace
[52:20] he's our peace he's our healing and I am
[52:24] the Lord thy God that heals all of your
[52:27] diseases he is the door to heaven and
[52:30] there's no other door or no other way
[52:32] but through Jesus Christ he's the door
[52:33] to heaven and now if Jesus is the door
[52:36] to all these things and faith is the key
[52:40] that unlocks the door now if Jesus is
[52:43] the door to all these promises of God
[52:45] here we go faith in his finished work
[52:48] unlocks every door to every treasure
[52:52] there is inside the kingdom of God faith
[52:55] is the key
[52:56] that unlocks every promise he make the
[53:00] key of Faith does that faith in his
[53:02] finished work it's these keys that we
[53:05] are speaking on oh praise God this work
[53:07] is already finished when Jesus died at
[53:10] Calvary he paid the price for your
[53:12] Redemption he paid a price for you to
[53:14] get delivered as a sinner and to be
[53:16] justified it doesn't mean you remain a
[53:19] sinner he take the opportunity to scoop
[53:21] you up and bless you and sanctify you
[53:23] and clean you up you must want that you

[1:01:54] you
[1:01:56] um my name is brother
[1:01:58] Olu and I from Lagos
[1:02:02] Nigeria and it's a blessing to be
[1:02:05] here though I can say with very mixed
[1:02:08] feelings for purposes I mean for reasons
[1:02:11] that we all are aware
[1:02:14] of but I want to say to start
[1:02:17] off um to thank the church
[1:02:20] again because it's so easy to see and
[1:02:24] appreciate the quality of the Holy
[1:02:25] Spirit in this
[1:02:28] church it's greatest to see the spirit
[1:02:31] among the
[1:02:33] Believers Spirit of
[1:02:36] togetherness the spirit of
[1:02:38] unity and a sweet Spirit of
[1:02:40] Love brother bam said the beauty of the
[1:02:44] church is not so much in the building
[1:02:47] the beauty of the church is the
[1:02:48] character of the
[1:02:50] people and you all are a truly beautiful
[1:02:54] group of Christian belever
[1:02:57] and I don't say that for
[1:02:59] effect because many of you don't know me
[1:03:01] but I I I've been in this church a long
[1:03:04] time this is my church in the city of
[1:03:07] London from way back in the
[1:03:10] 80s and you're a true lovely group with
[1:03:14] a very sweet
[1:03:15] spirit and I ask and
[1:03:18] admonish and plead and pray that you
[1:03:21] please remain that
[1:03:23] way that way
[1:03:32] so I remember my wife and I coming
[1:03:34] through in
[1:03:37] 1985 on our way back home from Brother
[1:03:39] moso's first meetings in
[1:03:44] Tulsa and um um brother Peter had me uh
[1:03:49] speak I mean while I was
[1:03:52] here but I remember the service where he
[1:03:56] spoke and give a testimony about the
[1:04:00] convention and he said something he was
[1:04:02] talking about how the service the
[1:04:04] services really changed
[1:04:07] him and he made this statement he said
[1:04:10] my wife told me you are changed and then
[1:04:15] he said when your wife tells you you are
[1:04:19] changed you really are
[1:04:21] changing meetings really
[1:04:24] change now why that struck me because
[1:04:28] minister is not used to saying
[1:04:31] that and I came through the Anglican
[1:04:35] Church the Baptist Church and the
[1:04:38] Pentecostal church and didn't get used
[1:04:41] to ministers saying
[1:04:44] that um because ministers are not
[1:04:46] supposed to
[1:04:48] admit such things like they
[1:04:52] changed um but here was this man this
[1:04:54] pastor doing just
[1:04:57] and even at that young age I realized
[1:05:00] that this was a very
[1:05:01] sincere transparent
[1:05:05] Minister not for the Optics not for the
[1:05:09] effects but genuine sinere St from the
[1:05:14] heart and for those of you who knew
[1:05:16] brother
[1:05:16] Peter you can know whether I'm just
[1:05:18] saying nice
[1:05:19] words I'm saying the
[1:05:21] truth amen amen so um um it was this
[1:05:26] type of sincere
[1:05:28] display why that struck me it was this
[1:05:31] type of sincere
[1:05:33] display that I saw in brother Bram and
[1:05:36] that's what brought me in the
[1:05:38] message I didn't come in the message
[1:05:40] because I understood God Head what a
[1:05:42] baptism as a matter of fact my
[1:05:45] background I argued about those things I
[1:05:48] like the man's Spirit reading the salmon
[1:05:51] books but I didn't agree what he was
[1:05:53] saying no eternal hell
[1:05:56] it cannot be but I like the man's spirit
[1:06:00] I I love the
[1:06:01] transparency because they the
[1:06:03] Pentecostal the big guys I mean I
[1:06:07] wouldn't mention names but the big
[1:06:08] Pentecostal guys who are brother
[1:06:11] contemporaries I thought they never did
[1:06:13] anything
[1:06:15] wrong and here was I a young Christian I
[1:06:18] wasn't living in sin I got saved once by
[1:06:21] the grace of God but I recognized my
[1:06:24] Humanity I n perfect and I had
[1:06:27] challenges I had to overcome but when I
[1:06:30] look at those ministers it's like they
[1:06:32] have no challenges at all and I felt so
[1:06:35] helpless I felt so
[1:06:37] disempowered but when I but when I read
[1:06:40] brother bham and he said this thing he
[1:06:43] talked about um the the
[1:06:47] attorney and when he had the tax case
[1:06:50] and he told this lie and I'm in shock
[1:06:54] this man that I'm reading about
[1:06:56] with these Miracles and these things
[1:06:59] admitting that he told a lie he did
[1:07:02] something for me it encouraged me that
[1:07:06] if I make a
[1:07:08] mistake all hope was not
[1:07:11] lost and then I heard him another time
[1:07:15] say he came back from a tree and then he
[1:07:17] was talking to his wife and she wanted
[1:07:20] him to spank
[1:07:22] Joseph and he said no I can't I don't
[1:07:24] have the heart to do it and she slammed
[1:07:26] the door on him and said if you had to
[1:07:29] stay with this children all the
[1:07:31] time and then he said later when he was
[1:07:33] praying the angel told him to tell her
[1:07:37] that he did not like she should not have
[1:07:40] done
[1:07:41] that this was my background and I'm in
[1:07:44] days I don't understand what this man is
[1:07:47] saying I don't believe what he's saying
[1:07:50] but I will go with this man that's how I
[1:07:51] came in the message and the
[1:07:54] understanding came later
[1:07:55] so when I came in to the church heon's
[1:07:58] Hall and I'm hearing brother Peter talk
[1:08:01] about the conention changed me I feel
[1:08:04] this is genuine same type of spirit that
[1:08:08] brought me in the message and so that
[1:08:11] Spirit of plainness and and
[1:08:15] sincerity and honesty the
[1:08:19] Integrity as characterized by the Peter
[1:08:22] group and that's why I say that please
[1:08:25] don't change
[1:08:27] us amen so it's good to be here
[1:08:30] today
[1:08:32] amen um let me just um do a song quickly
[1:08:37] before I'm sorry the musicians if you

[1:12:06] [Music]
[1:12:10] assembly and I bring GRE to you again on

[1:12:34] you amen all
[1:12:37] right can we go
[1:12:40] ahead are you
[1:12:42] ready I'm not much of a of a Preacher so
[1:12:46] and I want to apologize up
[1:12:48] front I'm trying to grow into the slides
[1:12:51] and
[1:12:53] things because Peter had that perfected
[1:12:56] to a to a
[1:13:01] signs um so um I trust and hope that
[1:13:06] I'll be able to see something that will
[1:13:07] be a blessing to
[1:13:10] you
[1:13:12] amen so we thank God for the enter
[1:13:16] message of Malachi
[1:13:18] 4 and that Prophet came and revealed The
[1:13:21] Mystery of the entire Bible
[1:13:25] amen and he came out as Jesus Christ the
[1:13:28] same yesterday today and forever the
[1:13:32] prophet made the
[1:13:33] Bible present
[1:13:35] tense everything in the Bible the
[1:13:38] stories the history the different
[1:13:42] circumstances the situations the prophet
[1:13:44] brought them into
[1:13:46] present so that he transported the land
[1:13:48] of the Bible to you and I and we can
[1:13:52] relate to the things in the Bible as
[1:13:55] though they were happening today so the
[1:13:57] Bible becomes not a book of
[1:13:59] stories but a book of
[1:14:01] life and the Bible is a book of lessons
[1:14:06] that God's spirit
[1:14:08] breathed and spoke to 40 different um
[1:14:14] writers and they were spread over 1,500
[1:14:18] to 2,000
[1:14:21] years and that's how the Bible was
[1:14:23] written God wrote it but through
[1:14:27] men and there is not one single
[1:14:31] contradiction in the Bible written by
[1:14:34] men from diverse
[1:14:36] backgrounds but you can't find one
[1:14:39] single
[1:14:40] contradiction I know that's contrary to
[1:14:42] what these atheist and some of these
[1:14:44] other folks try to tell us but they're
[1:14:47] wrong but that's not the subject of our
[1:14:49] talk
[1:14:50] today so the Bible is God's instruction
[1:14:54] manual
[1:14:56] for
[1:14:56] mankind and we thank god brother bam
[1:14:59] came with a message to make the Bible
[1:15:04] not a book of history but a Living Word
[1:15:08] a living book that you and I can relate
[1:15:11] to
[1:15:12] you amen am it's a book that teaches us
[1:15:17] all the lessons that
[1:15:19] life has ever and will ever teach
[1:15:22] mankind because God put those lessons
[1:15:26] the Bible is a book of life in all his
[1:15:30] ramifications Natural Life spiritual
[1:15:34] life you find the answer in the Bible
[1:15:37] you find the instructions in the Bible
[1:15:39] and we thank God for that prophet of
[1:15:42] Malachi for who came and preached the
[1:15:45] entire Bible so how privileged we
[1:15:49] are for many young folks who are born in
[1:15:53] the message there a t value these
[1:15:56] things is almost sometimes feels like
[1:15:59] you know we we like being hedged
[1:16:02] in but for those who have been able to
[1:16:06] taste out of the message you find that
[1:16:09] there is nothing that even comes a close
[1:16:13] second to this message and we're not
[1:16:16] saying that in Pride we send that with
[1:16:20] gratitude to the grace of God so we
[1:16:23] thank God for Prophet that came and
[1:16:26] unveiled and revealed the Bible and
[1:16:29] uncovered the life
[1:16:31] lessons that are hidden within its pages
[1:16:35] from the different lives and the
[1:16:37] characters in The
[1:16:39] Bible and that Prophet revealed shadows
[1:16:42] and
[1:16:43] types from the Bible and with a message
[1:16:47] around it and by that message he has
[1:16:51] called out a
[1:16:52] bride shape a bride
[1:16:55] molding a bright so she will be like
[1:16:58] Jesus
[1:16:59] Christ so she'll be prepared and made
[1:17:02] ready for the resurrection and the
[1:17:05] Rapture because that's what we are here
[1:17:07] doing on the face of this
[1:17:09] Earth the most important job any
[1:17:12] Minister can do is to prepare their
[1:17:14] people for the coming of the Lord
[1:17:18] because after all has been said and
[1:17:20] done the ENT time message of Malachi 4
[1:17:25] the Seven Seals and the Seven Thunders
[1:17:28] that that Prophet brought that great
[1:17:30] Elijah Prophet is end time message is
[1:17:35] only an
[1:17:36] invitation to live the life of Jesus
[1:17:39] Christ that's all there is to it is an
[1:17:42] invitation that you might be like Jesus
[1:17:45] it breaks down to world to you that even
[1:17:49] a little child can understand I want to
[1:17:53] be like Jesus not in your head but
[1:17:56] something in your soul to be like Jesus
[1:17:59] how we thank God for that great Elijah
[1:18:02] prophet of Malachi 4 that's what the
[1:18:05] message is about so we've come here
[1:18:08] today as we do on all days we come to
[1:18:11] church and even in our homes when we
[1:18:14] read the word or when we have a family
[1:18:16] devotions or even in our private
[1:18:19] lives when we pick up the word we pick
[1:18:22] up the word to learn life lessons from
[1:18:25] the
[1:18:27] Bible from what the the prophet of
[1:18:29] malach for has revealed to us I'm
[1:18:32] speaking about learning the Bible
[1:18:35] carries this thought
[1:18:37] further because we learn from the Bible
[1:18:39] like I said already but the Bible
[1:18:41] carries it further and let us understand
[1:18:44] that we also can
[1:18:46] learn even people whose lives have been
[1:18:50] impacted by God whether they here
[1:18:54] whether they have passed
[1:18:56] on and this Lear
[1:18:58] experience is what we all
[1:19:01] need to Perfect The Art of
[1:19:05] Doing so that our lives can be
[1:19:10] shaped to be more like Jesus every
[1:19:12] single day amen especially when somebody
[1:19:15] has passed
[1:19:17] on that occasion offers us a great
[1:19:19] learning
[1:19:21] experience to learn from the life of one
[1:19:25] who used to be with us but has now
[1:19:28] passed on
[1:19:29] eternity Ecclesiastes 7 vers 108 I'm
[1:19:33] trying to keep a TB on my time
[1:19:35] here um um because um it says verses
[1:19:41] 108 I'll just read through that quickly
[1:19:44] a good name is better than precious
[1:19:45] ointment and the day of death than the
[1:19:48] day of one's
[1:19:49] birth why he saying this here is because
[1:19:53] that offers us chance to look in the
[1:19:56] present's life and
[1:19:58] learn when we learn from their lives we
[1:20:01] add it to our lives just become better
[1:20:05] people become more shaped into the image
[1:20:07] of Jesus
[1:20:08] Christ he say it's better to go to the
[1:20:10] house of morning than to go to the house
[1:20:12] of feasting for that is the end of all
[1:20:14] men and the living will lay to his
[1:20:21] heart sorrow is better than laughter
[1:20:24] amen by the sadness of the countenance
[1:20:26] The Heart Is Made
[1:20:30] better these are like you know what you
[1:20:33] call like oxymoronic
[1:20:35] things how can sorrow be
[1:20:38] better and all of that but it's because
[1:20:42] when there's a death we have a the
[1:20:45] opportunity to look at the life and we
[1:20:49] can connect the dots things we did not
[1:20:51] even we did not even see
[1:20:54] didn't place any importance on while the
[1:20:59] person was alive when they are gone we
[1:21:02] can connect the dogs and see oh and
[1:21:06] apply to our lives
[1:21:10] amen verse four the heart of the wise is
[1:21:13] in the house of mourning but the heart
[1:21:15] of fools is in the house of
[1:21:17] merth in other in other words our pastor
[1:21:23] brother Peter has passed on and we still
[1:21:26] hurt because I still hurt and if I feel
[1:21:30] this way I know you still hurt and
[1:21:33] nobody tells me not to hurt what Jesus
[1:21:35] said is don't hurt and sorrow like the
[1:21:39] world be
[1:21:41] hurt but in the midst of that we want to
[1:21:45] look back and see how brother Peter's
[1:21:48] life inspires us to be better people oh
[1:21:52] that's what Pastor was saying and we let
[1:21:55] the devil know even though our pastor is
[1:21:57] gone we're living
[1:22:00] testimony of what he wanted to us to be
[1:22:03] I wish the pastor Could See Me Now to
[1:22:06] see I'm
[1:22:07] better today than I was last week and
[1:22:11] I'll be better tomorrow
[1:22:12] still that's what is all about the heart
[1:22:16] of the wise is the has of morning even
[1:22:19] though we mourn let's be wise so we can
[1:22:22] learn from this great life that that was
[1:22:26] here with us and shephered us and lived
[1:22:31] an example and a legacy before us the
[1:22:35] heart of the wife the has of morning but
[1:22:37] the Heart of Heart of foce is in the
[1:22:39] house of
[1:22:40] Mer and I'll move on down to verse eight
[1:22:43] better is the end of a thing than the
[1:22:45] beginning thereof and the patient in
[1:22:48] spirit is better than the proud in
[1:22:52] spirit so what the is saying here it's
[1:22:56] better at the end of a life when a baby
[1:22:58] is born you can't learn anything from
[1:23:01] the baby's life because the baby might
[1:23:03] turn out good it might turn out not so
[1:23:06] good but when somebody's passed on you
[1:23:08] can take a look at their lives and
[1:23:10] connect the dots and take inspiration
[1:23:13] for your own life and that's why the end
[1:23:16] of a thing is better than the beginning
[1:23:19] there so we want to learn from the life
[1:23:23] of one who was here with us until just a
[1:23:25] few weeks ago our pastor brother Peter
[1:23:29] Chandler and I don't mean just today I'm
[1:23:30] mean like every single day that's what
[1:23:33] you do when when you think what would
[1:23:36] Jesus
[1:23:37] do what would he do how would Pastor
[1:23:40] want this handle how would Pastor want
[1:23:43] me to do this here not because you are
[1:23:46] glorifying a man but you are leaving a
[1:23:49] testament and you are taking an
[1:23:51] inspiration from the life of one that
[1:23:54] went ahead of you so we want to learn so
[1:23:57] that in the midst of our pain and
[1:23:59] sorrow the lessons from his life will
[1:24:02] more us into better human beings better
[1:24:04] Christians than we were even while he
[1:24:07] was
[1:24:07] here so we come to church to learn to
[1:24:10] learn the Life of Christ life is all
[1:24:14] about
[1:24:15] learning we human beings are learning
[1:24:20] creatures that's just how God made us
[1:24:23] that's just how we are wise
[1:24:25] you don't have to feel that way that's
[1:24:28] just how we
[1:24:29] are amen we were created and programmed
[1:24:33] by
[1:24:34] God the Creator to
[1:24:37] learn and unfortunately we also happen
[1:24:39] to learn the
[1:24:40] good and the bad but it wasn't supposed
[1:24:44] to be that way because in the beginning
[1:24:46] you were programmed to learn the good
[1:24:49] but the fall changed all that and the
[1:24:52] ability and the capability to learn the
[1:24:53] bad
[1:24:55] came in after the fall so life all life
[1:24:58] is about
[1:24:59] learning and as we learn we
[1:25:03] live and as we learn we grow you know
[1:25:07] the scripture that says um um he that is
[1:25:11] dead while
[1:25:14] leaving those people are leaving but
[1:25:16] they're not learning
[1:25:18] anything and when you don't learn you
[1:25:21] are not leaving you are just alive
[1:25:25] you are not leaving life so as we learn
[1:25:28] we leave we grow because when we stop
[1:25:32] learning we stop growing we stop leaving
[1:25:36] and we
[1:25:38] die and we begin this PR of
[1:25:41] learning only hours after we are
[1:25:45] born some say six hours after we are
[1:25:48] born the baby starts to learn its
[1:25:51] environment start to learn the feel of
[1:25:53] the plank
[1:25:55] start to learn the warmth of his
[1:25:57] mother's body and even stories tell us
[1:26:00] now I mean for some time now that we
[1:26:03] even start this learning process from
[1:26:05] the
[1:26:06] womb that's why you'll see mothers
[1:26:08] talking to their babies while they in
[1:26:10] the womb and that baby in the womb has
[1:26:13] learned the mother's voice so that when
[1:26:16] that baby comes out it knows the
[1:26:18] mother's voice and goes right away to
[1:26:20] the mother's
[1:26:22] bosom to try to get milk
[1:26:25] for so that is what learning does to us
[1:26:29] we start learning as soon as we come
[1:26:32] here into the world and as we learn we
[1:26:36] form
[1:26:37] habits and the habits shape us and form
[1:26:40] our
[1:26:41] character and the character that we form
[1:26:44] defines the person that we
[1:26:47] become therefore when we are born each
[1:26:51] one of us tou on a learning ADV
[1:26:55] Adventure which is called the Journey of
[1:26:59] life and what we make of our journey
[1:27:01] through
[1:27:02] life is defined by what we learn it's
[1:27:06] defined by our
[1:27:07] learning because life is all about
[1:27:11] learning the Lord Jesus he came here
[1:27:16] with the gospel of
[1:27:17] redemption not justification but
[1:27:20] Redemption and when he came he came was
[1:27:24] to the lost sheep of the House of
[1:27:26] Israel and Israel rejected his message
[1:27:30] and history tells us St Matthew 11 I
[1:27:34] think Scofield says that and other
[1:27:36] history that St Matthew 11 was the
[1:27:40] lowest moment in the physical existence
[1:27:44] of the Lord Jesus Christ because he had
[1:27:46] been rejected nobody lacked rejection he
[1:27:50] had been rejected and he was feeling so
[1:27:52] low and in that state
[1:27:54] he turned around with a new message to a
[1:27:58] new audience and said come unto me all
[1:28:02] you that labor and a heavy laden and I
[1:28:05] will give you rest come and learn of
[1:28:09] me and take my yoke upon you and you
[1:28:12] shall find rest your souls for my yoke
[1:28:15] is easy and my bur is light that's how
[1:28:18] he announced his his Gospel of
[1:28:22] redemption he did not say come and be
[1:28:25] saved it didn't say Come and Get Right
[1:28:27] with God it didn't say come and be rid
[1:28:30] of your sins none of that he said come
[1:28:33] and learn come and learn amen
[1:28:39] hallelujah ever wonder why he said come
[1:28:41] and
[1:28:43] learn because veiled away and talked
[1:28:47] into the
[1:28:47] learning is the story of
[1:28:50] redemption Redemption not justification
[1:28:54] the Redemption
[1:28:56] justification sanctification the baptism
[1:28:59] of the Holy Ghost the forming of the
[1:29:01] word image an adoption time to where
[1:29:05] born Sons F Sons will speak and their
[1:29:09] words will be back all that is veiled in
[1:29:12] that common land of me God very God in
[1:29:16] human skin that's how he announced his
[1:29:19] his ministry amen and in in in the word
[1:29:23] learning is heeding how this all came
[1:29:27] about is that word learning is heeding
[1:29:30] all the story from way back in elohim's
[1:29:34] mind in that and in there is veiled also
[1:29:38] how we can
[1:29:40] appropriate these blessings of
[1:29:42] redemption for ourselves so life is a
[1:29:46] journey a journey of
[1:29:48] learning and if you if you
[1:29:50] notice a typical Journey has two
[1:29:53] character istics to it two qualities at
[1:29:56] least to
[1:29:57] it has a destination and has a
[1:30:01] purpose but I ask is that invariably
[1:30:05] so it should be but is it invariably so
[1:30:10] a a journey has a destination and a
[1:30:12] purpose it should be but not necessarily
[1:30:15] so because when uh um um God spoke to
[1:30:20] Lucifer in Job chapter one said where
[1:30:23] you going
[1:30:24] said nowhere I just been going through
[1:30:28] and I have no purpose this I'm I'm just
[1:30:31] going around so that proves to
[1:30:34] you that you can have a journey that has
[1:30:37] no purpose at all and the devil anoints
[1:30:40] people in the world today who are in
[1:30:44] this world here as though this life has
[1:30:46] no purpose as it has no
[1:30:48] meaning amen but even
[1:30:52] though you can go through life or a
[1:30:55] journey without a particular specific
[1:30:57] purpose I mean without a destination
[1:31:00] rather every Journey has a specific
[1:31:03] purpose like Lucifer did not have a
[1:31:06] destination said I'm going through andow
[1:31:08] but he had a purpose to cause
[1:31:11] trouble and every Journey even though it
[1:31:14] does not have a
[1:31:16] destination has a
[1:31:18] purpose amen but even H but but our
[1:31:22] journey of life has a destination has a
[1:31:26] [Music]
[1:31:28] purpose and once your journey is
[1:31:30] completed you go back to your
[1:31:33] destination like I've come here from
[1:31:35] Nigeria I've finished my journey the
[1:31:38] purpose I go back home Jesus said I come
[1:31:41] from God to finish this work and I go
[1:31:44] back to God
[1:31:47] again that's
[1:31:49] right right we are born into this world
[1:31:53] brought here by
[1:31:55] and this journey of life has a
[1:31:58] purpose and also has a
[1:32:00] destination even though many would like
[1:32:02] us to
[1:32:03] believe we just we're just here and when
[1:32:06] we leave here that's all that all there
[1:32:09] is to it don't you believe it don't you
[1:32:12] believe it because there's nothing could
[1:32:14] be further from the
[1:32:15] truth and it doesn't make sense even a
[1:32:19] little child can know that doesn't make
[1:32:21] any sense I came to the UK
[1:32:24] and then I have no destination I just I
[1:32:26] just they will ask you at the at the
[1:32:28] Visa I mean the the border border post
[1:32:31] what is your purpose in coming
[1:32:35] here and many times they ask you where
[1:32:37] is your address that you are
[1:32:40] staying so you have a purpose and a
[1:32:42] destination for every but the Journey of
[1:32:45] Life someone will believe you are just
[1:32:47] here and when we die that's it we just
[1:32:51] disappear no it it doesn't even make
[1:32:53] sense from
[1:32:54] nature doesn't make any sense at all so
[1:32:57] it's so easy for a child to see the
[1:32:59] Folly and the fallacy of that
[1:33:02] argument because what those people fail
[1:33:04] to understand about the Journey of life
[1:33:08] is that God gives each one of us the
[1:33:12] choice to determine our own
[1:33:15] destination when our journey is ended
[1:33:19] and our time on Earth is complete so
[1:33:21] when you hear somebody saying just there
[1:33:24] he hasn't chosen his
[1:33:26] destination but if you don't choose your
[1:33:28] destination there's a destination you
[1:33:30] are going to go to but God rich in Mercy
[1:33:34] gives us the choice to choose our
[1:33:36] destination so when our journey on life
[1:33:38] is finished we go back to our father's
[1:33:41] home Jesus said I come from God I go
[1:33:45] back to God again
[1:33:48] hallelujah amen so my young man my young
[1:33:52] woman whoever don't let anybody tell you
[1:33:56] that we come here and we just die and
[1:33:59] nothing happens after that it doesn't
[1:34:01] make sense we come here there's a home
[1:34:04] to go to there's a head to stay away
[1:34:07] from and by God's grace we believe we
[1:34:10] are
[1:34:11] predestinated to go back to our father's
[1:34:14] home
[1:34:15] Hallelujah so we are here for a specific
[1:34:19] purpose That's Unique for each one of
[1:34:21] us and they suddenly just
[1:34:24] destination waiting for each one of us
[1:34:26] at the end of life Journey but that
[1:34:28] destination God gives us the choice to
[1:34:31] decide whether where we want to go to if
[1:34:33] we if we don't take a choice by default
[1:34:37] we have taken a choice that we are going
[1:34:40] to the place of the town for here we are
[1:34:43] God's Sons and Daughters
[1:34:45] predestinated to come from God
[1:34:48] predestinated to go back to God again
[1:34:52] Hallelujah so here with a purpose we are
[1:34:55] here in this world here whether you
[1:34:57] young or old you are you have a purpose
[1:34:59] in being here there's a purpose while we
[1:35:02] are here now speaking of purpose our
[1:35:06] purpose in life has two parts to
[1:35:09] it two sides to it one part of the
[1:35:13] purpose is a common purpose we all
[1:35:16] have and the other part of the purpose
[1:35:19] the second half of it is specific for
[1:35:22] you for you to do Jesus said 33 years
[1:35:27] old he said father I thank Thee I have
[1:35:31] finish the work which you gave me to do
[1:35:35] he was 33 years old he finished the work
[1:35:39] that God gave him to do each one of us
[1:35:42] here you have a specific job that God
[1:35:46] has given you to do and you will do it
[1:35:50] by the grace of almighty God we didn't
[1:35:52] just come here
[1:35:54] to LLY gag around we came here for a
[1:35:57] purpose we are Purpose
[1:35:59] Driven out of my way Satan ad of my way
[1:36:02] I got the king's message we are here for
[1:36:05] a purpose we come from God and we go
[1:36:08] back to God again beli thou this beli
[1:36:12] thou this
[1:36:15] Hallelujah so I said our
[1:36:18] purpose one half is two purpose is
[1:36:22] twofold one half is common to all of us
[1:36:25] and one half of the purpose is specific
[1:36:27] for you what's the half common to all of
[1:36:30] us Solomon told us that and I read the
[1:36:33] scripture Ecclesiastes 12 this is the
[1:36:37] whole duty of man to Ser God and keep

[1:36:45] are or you are Joe Biden or Donald Trump
[1:36:49] or you are the little boy in the garage
[1:36:51] or you are the bus conductor
[1:36:54] let's hear the conclusion of the whole
[1:36:57] matter Every Man Has This purpose to
[1:37:01] serve God to serve God to serve God and
[1:37:05] keep his
[1:37:06] Commandments
[1:37:08] [Music]
[1:37:09] [Applause]
[1:37:13] amen the purpose to serve God to make it
[1:37:17] our lives work that's the whole duty of
[1:37:22] man
[1:37:24] hallah Ecclesiastes 12 tells us that all
[1:37:28] of us have that
[1:37:29] job that work so to speak where you are
[1:37:33] called to serve that's a
[1:37:36] ministry that's a
[1:37:38] Ministry
[1:37:40] amen I I I don't know in the UK how they
[1:37:43] do it but but in Nigeria and most parts
[1:37:46] of Africa they call the government
[1:37:48] departments
[1:37:51] Ministries in Africa those guys think
[1:37:54] they are there for you to serve them but
[1:37:56] a minister that's why call a minister of
[1:37:58] the Gospel a minister is to
[1:38:02] serve the minister
[1:38:04] serves the minister of of of Education

[1:38:13] sector the minister of the Gospel she
[1:38:15] serve the gospel sector Ser the people

[1:38:21] of man to ser God it means God given
[1:38:25] each one of us a Ministry to share to
[1:38:30] find the spot where God wants us to be
[1:38:33] so we can serve him and let your light
[1:38:35] shine for Jesus you must shine it from
[1:38:37] your heart to brighten up the
[1:38:40] corner where you are
[1:38:44] [Applause]
[1:38:52] Hallelujah amen the other half that's
[1:38:55] specific to
[1:38:56] you what is that that's a specific thing
[1:39:01] that God gave you to do you can say I'm
[1:39:05] serving God that's the whole duty of man

[1:40:42] together the two parts of our Po in life
[1:40:45] out up to this in addition to Every
[1:40:48] Man's specific
[1:40:49] work and
[1:40:52] purpose every specific work and purpose
[1:40:55] we find a universal purpose common to
[1:40:58] all of us which is to serve God and keep
[1:41:01] his Commandments which is essentially a
[1:41:04] Ministry doesn't make you a Ministry of

[1:41:39] day so what is what this ultimately
[1:41:42] means is that your work is not only your

[1:41:50] where God has planted you to serve God
[1:41:53] and keep his

[1:42:08] committed our purpose our task our
[1:42:11] ministry our walk here on Earth it's
[1:42:14] time to go back to our
[1:42:16] destination it's time to say like Jesus
[1:42:19] I have finished the work which you have
[1:42:22] given me to do and I come back to you oh
[1:42:24] father that you glorify me with the
[1:42:27] glory I had with you before the of the
[1:42:29] world oh Hallelujah can you say
[1:42:32] hallelujah
[1:42:35] hallelujah
[1:42:37] hallelujah so how much time do you and I
[1:42:40] have to fulfill this this calling that's
[1:42:44] been given to
[1:42:45] us to serve God in a calling to have a
[1:42:51] ministry as a pastor
[1:42:54] as a father as a mother as a farmer to
[1:42:58] have it how long time do we have how
[1:43:01] long time do we have truth truth is none
[1:43:05] of us knows none of us knows how long
[1:43:07] time is to
[1:43:10] on so how much
[1:43:12] time to us we do not
[1:43:15] know but let's hear what job said in the
[1:43:17] Bible Job 14 ver 1 5 the man that is
[1:43:22] born of a woman woman is a few days and
[1:43:26] full of
[1:43:29] trouble he come for like a flower
[1:43:32] beautiful and is cut down it fleeth also
[1:43:35] as a shadow and Contin
[1:43:40] not and does thou open Thine Eyes Upon
[1:43:43] such an one and bringest me into
[1:43:46] judgment with
[1:43:49] thee who can bring a clean thing out of
[1:43:52] an unclean
[1:43:54] one seeing his days that's man seeing
[1:43:58] his days are
[1:44:00] determined the number of his months are
[1:44:02] with me God are with thee God thou has
[1:44:06] appointed his bounds that he cannot
[1:44:12] pass so what job is here saying is that
[1:44:15] God set the boundaries of our time on
[1:44:18] out here our entry and our
[1:44:22] exit they could not extend it by one
[1:44:24] Split
[1:44:25] Second nothing happens to God by
[1:44:28] accident what you and I should focus on
[1:44:30] is I want to finish the
[1:44:33] work I must finish the work I must
[1:44:36] finish the work Jesus finish his work
[1:44:39] and I'll show you Pastor Chand finish
[1:44:41] his work I will show you from the Bible
[1:44:44] Hallelujah and you and I are still here
[1:44:47] are we going to finish our work that's
[1:44:49] what God is interested in it's not how
[1:44:51] long or how short
[1:44:54] amen so how much time do we have to
[1:44:56] finish our
[1:44:57] work nobody knows but this much we know
[1:45:01] from what we read in job each of us has
[1:45:03] only a few
[1:45:05] days and those days have been
[1:45:07] predetermined by God and we can't extend
[1:45:10] those days not even by a second I me
[1:45:14] even though we all trust three score
[1:45:15] years and 10 and even up to
[1:45:18] 8 as some says but if you notice even
[1:45:23] our Lord Jesus Christ God is example son
[1:45:27] did not spend half of 70
[1:45:29] years he spend only 33 years but in
[1:45:33] spite of that short period of time he
[1:45:36] came at the end of those 33 years and
[1:45:38] said father I have finished the work
[1:45:41] which th gave us me to do he was a young
[1:45:44] man in our context but he has finish the
[1:45:47] work what a Purpose Driven young man
[1:45:50] what a Purpose Driven young man oh
[1:45:54] hallelujah amen only 33 years of age but
[1:45:57] he finished the work that he was sent
[1:46:00] here to do he finished the work which
[1:46:03] God appointed him to do he achieved his
[1:46:05] life purpose and talk about the
[1:46:08] impact that his life those short 33
[1:46:10] short years had on all
[1:46:14] Humanity mankind has never been the
[1:46:17] same amen he impacted life so
[1:46:21] much that 2,000 years
[1:46:25] on that impact is still going
[1:46:28] on so life is all about the purpose and
[1:46:33] the destination we're going to but also
[1:46:35] about the
[1:46:36] impact that we live so the Journey of
[1:46:39] life is not about how
[1:46:40] long or how short the Journey of life is
[1:46:43] about purpose and the work that you do
[1:46:48] to engage in and fulfill that
[1:46:51] purpose it's all about finishing your
[1:46:53] work and fulfilling your purpose and
[1:46:56] then after your work has been done and
[1:46:59] your purpose has been fulfilled what is
[1:47:02] the impact and the legacy of your work
[1:47:06] in the life of others both for the
[1:47:09] present and the
[1:47:11] future
[1:47:12] Hallelujah so the Journey of life is all
[1:47:15] about finishing your work and leaving
[1:47:17] behind an impact as great and as massive
[1:47:20] as it can
[1:47:21] be like Jesus in the Journey of his
[1:47:24] life 33 years old when he when he died
[1:47:28] he finished his work he fulfilled his
[1:47:30] purpose and lay behind an impact and a
[1:47:33] legacy that last up until today so I ask
[1:47:36] you today as I'm trying to wind down
[1:47:39] here do you know why you're here on
[1:47:42] Earth my young man my young woman do you
[1:47:44] know why you're here on Earth fathers
[1:47:46] mothers do we know what we
[1:47:48] here amen Jesus said I have finished the
[1:47:51] world and we tell God that the work you
[1:47:53] gave me to
[1:47:54] do amen I'll show you in a minute how to
[1:47:58] arrive at that amen I see many people I
[1:48:02] don't mean here
[1:48:03] generally young people I want to know
[1:48:05] what's my purpose what's my purpose no
[1:48:07] you don't have to do that yeah there are
[1:48:09] things you can consider but I'll just
[1:48:11] show you from the life of Jesus how to
[1:48:14] walk into your purpose amen amen amen
[1:48:19] amen so I ask you today again do you
[1:48:22] know why
[1:48:23] here do you know your
[1:48:25] purpose I told you one half of the
[1:48:27] purpose to serve God and keep his
[1:48:31] Commandments but in there also we all
[1:48:34] have to have a specific thing that God
[1:48:37] gave us to do not everybody could be the
[1:48:40] Savior only one could do that Jesus not
[1:48:44] everyone could be the mother of your
[1:48:46] child only you could do that whatever
[1:48:49] God wants you to do it's specific to you
[1:48:52] and I so do you know why you're here on
[1:48:54] Earth sadly many human beings don't and
[1:48:58] that's why they conform you find young
[1:49:00] people even some older people just
[1:49:03] conform just want to be like everybody
[1:49:05] else but Romans 12 tells us to prove
[1:49:09] that people just conformed Romans 12
[1:49:12] tells us be not
[1:49:14] conformed to this world but be
[1:49:17] transformed by the renewing of your mind
[1:49:21] so you may prove what is is that good
[1:49:23] and perfect and acceptable will of God
[1:49:26] so I ask you why are you living at all
[1:49:31] why are we here but more specifically
[1:49:33] why are you here have you found out your
[1:49:36] purpose the work you are send here to
[1:49:38] accomplish and finish when you find your
[1:49:42] purpose then your life becomes a Purpose
[1:49:44] Driven Life that purpose drives you
[1:49:48] brother gram said in that famous message
[1:49:51] that I spoke to the young people people
[1:49:53] he said that young man he said something
[1:49:56] present it to you a certain something
[1:50:00] presents it to you and it's right in
[1:50:02] your soul and that certain something
[1:50:04] drives you drives you towards your goal
[1:50:08] drives you that when you find what your
[1:50:12] purpose is when you find that purpose
[1:50:15] nothing can stand in your way when you
[1:50:17] find out what your purpose is the Devil
[1:50:19] is a finished Hallelujah
[1:50:22] oh hallelujah amen brother Peter found
[1:50:26] his
[1:50:26] purpose Hallelujah Jesus found his
[1:50:29] purpose and he finished his work I have
[1:50:32] finished the work and on calvary's
[1:50:35] Mountain the last words he spoke it is
[1:50:38] finished even before he went to face the
[1:50:41] devil in hell I finished the
[1:50:44] work oh hallelujah what is said what a
[1:50:47] lord What A
[1:50:49] Savior and I can tell you without any
[1:50:51] Shadow of Doubt
[1:50:53] that brother Peter Chandler he found his
[1:50:56] purpose and he lived a Purpose Driven
[1:50:59] Life brother Peter found his found out
[1:51:02] his life's purpose found his life's work
[1:51:06] he found life's true meaning how do I
[1:51:08] know because it's easy to identify
[1:51:11] someone anyone who's living with
[1:51:14] purpose someone who's living for a curse
[1:51:17] it's easy to find
[1:51:18] out is you to find out somebody too who
[1:51:21] is just going here there just going to
[1:51:24] and throw but when you find somebody who
[1:51:27] live for a purpose it's easy to see
[1:51:31] it
[1:51:35] amen when you find somebody who from the
[1:51:38] purpose they live with passion they live
[1:51:41] with Zeal they live with
[1:51:43] diligence
[1:51:45] Hallelujah and therefore I say without
[1:51:48] any shadow of a doubt that brother Peter
[1:51:51] was ready for death he was ready to go
[1:51:55] not that he wanted to leave but he was
[1:51:57] ready to leave this world here and we
[1:52:00] also should make ready because we don't
[1:52:02] know when the when when when the time is
[1:52:04] going to come sister Monica gave that
[1:52:07] testimony that when she saw the look on
[1:52:08] mother Peter's face he was like he said
[1:52:11] I made
[1:52:12] it of course he made
[1:52:15] it I believe that last moment that's
[1:52:18] when that settled on his face I'm going
[1:52:20] out of here goodbye World good morning
[1:52:24] glory I made it Hallelujah and he's
[1:52:27] waiting for us on the other side he's
[1:52:29] waiting for every one of us young and
[1:52:31] old male female boy and girl our pastor
[1:52:35] is waiting on the other side Hallelujah
[1:52:38] who's going to go who's going to go
[1:52:42] hallelujah
[1:52:43] hallelujah like Jesus Christ Peter could
[1:52:46] cry out I finished the work which you
[1:52:49] gave me to do like Jesus on the cross
[1:52:52] they could cry out it is finished I made
[1:52:56] it I finished the work which you sent me
[1:52:59] here to do so in closing here how do you
[1:53:03] find your life's purpose how you find it
[1:53:06] from the life of Jesus by living a life
[1:53:09] that's full of
[1:53:11] zeal amen so the question you and I have
[1:53:15] here today how do you find your life's
[1:53:17] purpose and Jesus answered this for us
[1:53:20] by living your life with zeal with
[1:53:23] passion with diligence with commitment
[1:53:26] with dedication with energy with a zest
[1:53:29] for
[1:53:30] Life leaving life not reacting to life
[1:53:34] taking charge of Life Hallelujah not not
[1:53:39] lethargic letting life happen to you but
[1:53:42] being
[1:53:42] proactive and taking the son of the
[1:53:45] spirit and marching on in life

[1:56:51] carpenter
[1:56:53] that was what his life's work at the
[1:56:54] time and he did it with
[1:56:56] diligence seal the same seal he applied
[1:57:00] when he became the
[1:57:05] savior he was known the Bible says the
[1:57:09] carpenter of
[1:57:10] Nazareth in other words if you get to
[1:57:13] Nazareth where's the carpenter they will
[1:57:16] take you to Jesus
[1:57:18] shop because he made Master tables
[1:57:22] IA was a joke compared to him he was

[1:57:31] name the carpenter of
[1:57:34] Nazareth and they call you the N of

[1:57:53] I'm going to die on the cross no that
[1:57:56] Zeal him
[1:57:58] up that's the pathway to find your
[1:58:01] purpose in life oh
[1:58:06] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:58:10] [Applause]
[1:58:11] am
[1:58:15] H the
[1:58:16] purpose the Zeal Le the purpose and then
[1:58:21] when Le the purpose
[1:58:23] he will energize you on a daily basis to
[1:58:27] work in that purpose to fulfill your
[1:58:30] life's purpose oh my I think I just let
[1:58:34] let this
[1:58:36] go be sure that somebody won't feel I'm
[1:58:39] just talking about hard work I'm talking
[1:58:42] about passion then you'll find people
[1:58:46] they tell that musk has lot passion that
[1:58:49] you don't even have
[1:58:52] has passion for his job I'm not talking
[1:58:54] about
[1:58:55] that because I said the purpose is in
[1:58:59] two
[1:58:59] halves first half serve God keep his
[1:59:03] Commandments second half what you are
[1:59:06] given to do specif for you it might be
[1:59:08] speci for ellon musk to do all the
[1:59:10] things he's doing but how about the
[1:59:12] first house because until you connect
[1:59:14] the two together you hav't find your
[1:59:16] real purpose and until you find your
[1:59:18] real purpose you haven't assured your
[1:59:20] destination yet you have not confirmed
[1:59:23] your reservation
[1:59:25] yet so Alon musk has found the other
[1:59:28] half and he's doing a great job with it
[1:59:31] the president of your company the
[1:59:33] president of the company the mayor of
[1:59:35] London or whoever they there maybe they
[1:59:38] found that and they're doing a great job
[1:59:40] of it but how about the other half that
[1:59:42] says the whole duty of man is to serve
[1:59:45] God and keep his Commandments that's
[1:59:47] where we come in that's where we are
[1:59:49] different we combine the two together
[1:59:52] and find our purpose so we can confirm
[1:59:55] our destination when we live here so we
[1:59:58] can say I have finished the work that's
[2:00:01] what Pastor CH say I have finished the
[2:00:03] work I have confirmed my reservation and
[2:00:06] therefore now it's l up for me a Crown
[2:00:09] of
[2:00:10] Glory like Paul said oh
[2:00:15] hallelujah hallelujah amen I know anyone
[2:00:18] who knows Pastor Chandler knows that he
[2:00:20] lives his life like Jesus lived I'm not
[2:00:24] saying he was Jesus I said this message
[2:00:27] is an invitation to be like
[2:00:30] Jesus and Pastor CH live his life like
[2:00:34] Jesus lived with Zeal with deligence can
[2:00:38] I get a witness in the house can I get a
[2:00:41] witness in the house with passion can I
[2:00:44] get a witness in the house come on can I
[2:00:47] get a witness that's our pastor with
[2:00:50] Zeal with diligence I seen pictures the
[2:00:54] Zeal of the house of the Lord Brother
[2:00:55] Chandler knocking doing the carpentry
[2:00:58] work doing all the things just
[2:01:01] serving not waiting to be served but
[2:01:04] serving do whatever needs to be done
[2:01:07] resal at him
[2:01:08] up the Zeal eats you up on your job in
[2:01:12] Microsoft and doesn't eat you up in
[2:01:14] church you miss something there but if
[2:01:17] there ISS up in Microsoft ISS up in the
[2:01:20] house of God whether you are just singer
[2:01:22] in the service you're a worshiper Let
[2:01:25] Your Presence be felt in
[2:01:27] church like brother Raymond will always
[2:01:29] say I came to church to let the devil
[2:01:33] know what side I am on let that Zeal eat
[2:01:37] you up when you come to church let the
[2:01:40] devil know he's in church she's in
[2:01:44] church why the Zeal of the house of the
[2:01:47] Lord you oh Hallelujah
[2:01:52] hallelujah amen my last comment here and
[2:01:56] I try to close in by 5 minutes
[2:02:01] amen so you see now that zeil is
[2:02:05] everything but what does you really mean
[2:02:07] to live with
[2:02:08] Zeal I said so I said it already let me
[2:02:12] make it real clear real Zeal is not only
[2:02:16] passionate about his
[2:02:18] purpose let me get this let me do well
[2:02:21] on my J
[2:02:22] let me do this well no real Zeal Focus
[2:02:26] not not not just on the purpose of the
[2:02:28] journey real Zeal focus is also on
[2:02:31] finishing the journey and arriving at
[2:02:34] the destination which is the end goal of
[2:02:36] the
[2:02:37] journey I'm saying about all these guys
[2:02:40] they've done a great job but are they
[2:02:42] arriving at the destination to go back
[2:02:45] to a
[2:02:45] guard
[2:02:47] well you can judge in other words real
[2:02:52] is not just about diligence and
[2:02:54] passion it's also about arriving at the
[2:02:58] destination amen so in the scriptural
[2:03:01] context of
[2:03:02] zeal we must fulfill the two houses of
[2:03:06] our purpose on Earth before we'll arrive
[2:03:08] at the destination after our time on
[2:03:11] Earth has
[2:03:12] ended the elos and and all the guys of
[2:03:15] this world here God is waiting on them
[2:03:18] to fulfill the second half which is to
[2:03:21] Ser God
[2:03:23] they can say at the end of their Liv my
[2:03:27] therefore it's little for me a Crown of
[2:03:28] Glory Hallelujah but mostly the people
[2:03:32] neglect the more important Health which
[2:03:35] is which is to make the service of God
[2:03:37] as the sole purpose of Our
[2:03:39] Lives because it's this First Health
[2:03:42] that ensures that you make a
[2:03:44] choice to arrive at your Eternal
[2:03:46] destination in the father's home above
[2:03:49] after your journey on earth is
[2:03:52] like Israel in the Old
[2:03:54] Testament all these guys who don't focus
[2:03:57] on serving
[2:03:59] God as the more important purpose of
[2:04:02] their lives they're like Israel in the
[2:04:04] Old Testament like Paul said of them
[2:04:07] Brethren they serve God according to
[2:04:09] Zeal but not according to
[2:04:12] knowledge amen Romans 10 verse1 verse to
[2:04:15] ver4 Brethren my heart desire and prayer
[2:04:18] to God for Israel is that they might be
[2:04:21] saved
[2:04:22] for I bear them record that they have a
[2:04:23] Zeal of God but not according to
[2:04:26] knowledge for they being ignorant of
[2:04:28] God's righteousness and going about to
[2:04:30] establish their own righteousness have
[2:04:32] not submitted themselves to the right of
[2:04:33] God for the for Christ is the end of the
[2:04:36] law to
[2:04:38] them Hallelujah so church so Church what
[2:04:43] does it mean to be Zeal us Revelation 3
[2:04:46] and verse 19 as many as I Lord I rebuke
[2:04:50] and chasten
[2:04:52] be Zeal us
[2:04:53] therefore and repent brother bam said to
[2:04:57] be truly zealous you must repent
[2:05:00] first the Journey of zeal begins at
[2:05:05] repentance did Al musos begin at
[2:05:07] repentance I don't know but your journey
[2:05:09] of zeal that's going to win you a Crown
[2:05:12] of Glory begins our
[2:05:14] repentance the relationship with the
[2:05:16] father Hallelujah the Journey of zeal
[2:05:20] begins at repentance is not just being
[2:05:22] diligent and hard working no he deeper
[2:05:25] than that real Zeal drivs you to
[2:05:28] repentance first your inner man is
[2:05:31] changed somebody steps into your heart
[2:05:33] somebody steps into your life you become
[2:05:35] a prisoner of Jesus Christ Hallelujah
[2:05:39] and when you are that way then you can
[2:05:41] go in Microsoft or or wherever you are
[2:05:44] KPMG whatever and let that seal because
[2:05:48] that seal is now under the control of
[2:05:51] the spirit of God under the control of
[2:05:54] God's word because you know my whole
[2:05:57] business in this job is your Ser God and
[2:06:01] keep his Commandments our pastor an
[2:06:03] example our pastor an example ofal that
[2:06:07] get by repentance a repentant heart a
[2:06:11] heart in relationship with Jesus Christ
[2:06:13] a heart that turn around and walking
[2:06:15] with Jesus every day and you apply that
[2:06:18] Zeal in your heart it flows out
[2:06:22] every day into your external things on
[2:06:25] your job in your home on the farm so you
[2:06:29] got it all together the inner game and
[2:06:33] the outer game of zeal connected
[2:06:37] together oh hallelujah hallelujah I'm
[2:06:41] finished that's what it means to be
[2:06:43] zealous repentance relationship with
[2:06:46] Jesus Christ and then that Spirit drives
[2:06:50] you
[2:06:52] to be Zeal Us in the things of God and
[2:06:55] you can say like Jesus you can say like
[2:06:57] Peter Chandler the Zeal of the house of

[2:07:18] prophet thank God for an example

[2:08:25] and we saw a life full of seal we saw a
[2:08:27] life that was passionate that was
[2:08:29] diligent in doing his pastoral
[2:08:32] work amen and whatever need to do we saw
[2:08:36] that so the example of our pastor to be
[2:08:39] a Guiding Light to all of us because we
[2:08:42] could never ask for a better example to
[2:08:44] be a comfort
[2:08:45] to am miss the grief of losing him so
[2:08:48] unexpected and so soon and so sudden
[2:08:52] brother Peter gave all of us especially

[2:09:10] by sharing with us the good news of the
[2:09:13] gift of God the gift of God Jesus Christ

[2:12:43] did don't do that LC it doesn't work out

[2:12:58] commanded that will we do and that have
[2:13:00] I done Joshua buil upon

[2:13:21] now do you remember that the enemy will
[2:13:23] come and when he does just cling them
[2:13:26] much closer together and the one that
[2:13:29] the devil is using for an enemy will
[2:13:31] either get out or come in and be one of

[2:46:35] Services seven men of God coming under
[2:46:40] great expectation for such a time as
[2:46:42] this and we know the prophet taught us
[2:46:44] that the preacher cannot bring the
[2:46:46] Revival but the people are the ones who
[2:46:48] move the Revival so the Revival starts
[2:46:50] with us in our home in our prayer
[2:46:51] closets in our expectation and brother
[2:46:54] bham taught us you get what you expect
[2:46:56] so I encourage you to dig your Valley
[2:46:58] full of ditches but Bram said the deeper
[2:47:00] you dig the more blessing you could hold
[2:47:01] the more water you could hold so dig
[2:47:04] deep ditches raise your expectations
[2:47:07] higher than you've ever had it before
[2:47:09] but Bram said we need to ask for big
[2:47:10] things so whatever your need is whatever
[2:47:13] your desire is you need to raise
[2:47:15] it whatever whatever your hope is raise
[2:47:17] it you didn't ask enough so ask for more
[2:47:20] ask God for big things so we're looking
[2:47:22] for God to restore homes families
[2:47:24] marriages situations backsliders and I
[2:47:28] feel like as we are coming to the end of
[2:47:30] this journey as it were when was time
[2:47:32] for Moses to leave Pharaoh say take
[2:47:35] everything take your flocks take
[2:47:37] everything and go and we're going to
[2:47:39] reach that point friends where the enemy
[2:47:41] will say just take your family and go
[2:47:43] take them I know they they messed up
[2:47:44] here I but just take them and go because
[2:47:46] I tired of dealing with this God that
[2:47:49] you serve is too too this God is too big
[2:47:51] so I going to encourage you Church we're
[2:47:53] not going to leave one behind you're not
[2:47:55] going to leave your son behind you're
[2:47:57] not going to leave your daughter behind
[2:47:58] you're not going to leave your loved
[2:47:59] ones behind and brother bam taught us
[2:48:01] all that he ever love or love you will
[2:48:03] be over there so we are prophesying of a
[2:48:06] restoration of a Deliverance of every
[2:48:08] backslider of your children your family
[2:48:11] your friends your loved ones they are
[2:48:12] going to be under the blood and the and
[2:48:14] Jesus told them the promises unto you
[2:48:16] and to your children and to them that
[2:48:18] are far off and as many as the Lord Our
[2:48:21] God shall call so we are looking you
[2:48:23] better hold onto your seat because God
[2:48:24] is going to break chains and shackles
[2:48:26] and you're going to see people rushing
[2:48:28] inside of here not to see man but to see
