========================================

Amen. Blessed be his wonderful name. Reading from the book of Exodus, just one verse there, chapter 3 and verse 8. And it says, "And I am come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians, and to bring them up out of that land, unto a good land, and a large, unto a land flowing with milk and honey, unto the place of the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites." And just to paint a picture here, this is just after Abraham had the challenge to sacrifice Isaac. God provided a ram. And this was the promise at this point. Amen. &gt;&gt; I am come down to deliver. And he went on to say the land was a good land flowing with milk and honey. And he said it was the place of the Canaanites and the Hittites and the Amorites and Perizzites and Hivites and Jebusites. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, if we were to turn to Deuteronomy 11, reading from verse 22 to 25, speaking to Moses here, he said, "For if ye shall diligently keep all these commandments with which I commanded you to do them, to love the Lord your God, to walk in all his ways, and to cleave unto him, Then will the Lord drive out all these nations from before you, and you shall possess greater nations and mightier than yourself. Every place whereon the souls of your feet shall thread up thread shall be yours. From the wilderness and Lebanon, from the river, the river Euphrates, even unto the uttermost sea shall your coast be. There shall no man be able to stand before you. For the Lord your God shall lay the fair of you and the dread of you upon all the land that he shall tread upon as he had said unto you. And if we were to shift with me to Joshua 1:es 1:5, it sounds very similar, but it says, "Now after the death of Moses, the servant of the Lord, it came to pass that the Lord spake unto Joshua the son of Nun, Moses minister, saying, Moses, my servant is dead. Now therefore arise, go over this Jordan, thou and all this people unto the land which I do give them, even to the children of Israel. every place that the soul of your foot shall tread upon, that have I given unto you, as I said unto Moses, from the wilderness and this Lebanon, even unto the great river, the river Euphrates, all the land of the Hittites, and unto the great sea, toward the going down of the sun shall be a coast. There shall not any man be able to stand before thee all the days of thy life. As I was with Moses, so I will be with thee. I will not fail thee nor forsake thee. Let's just bow our heads. Oh heavenly father, we've read your word, Lord. Lord, any man could read your scripture, Lord, but I pray that you would inspire it to us tonight, Lord. I pray that you will open it aresh to us, Lord. Lord, I pray that whatever be said, Lord, that you will guide it, Lord. Lord, I pray that these few broken up words here be stitched together seamlessly, Lord, the way you want to deliver, Lord. Lord, I pray that you would bless your people tonight. Speak lip to air to them. Take me out of the way, Lord, Lord, and use me just as as a mouthpiece tonight, Lord. That your word could go forth, Lord. Lord, I pray that when we leave this place, we will be better or worse, Lord. That you will stir our hearts, Lord. That you will drive us into action in Jesus name we pray. Amen. &gt;&gt; You may have your seats at this time. &gt;&gt; You love the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, I read three scriptures and to some it may sound like I'm reading the same thing. different parts of the Bible the same thing. But I want to start with a simple point and I will start by giving my title actually for a title. The mission must be completed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The mission must be completed. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; For an inspiration not without a fight. &gt;&gt; It's not going to be easy. &gt;&gt; It's not going to be simple. It's not going to be a walk in the park. not without a fight, but the mission must be completed. &gt;&gt; Now, if if you could picture this now, &gt;&gt; God in speaking to Abraham, the angel came down. God provided a ram and there was a sacrifice made and he said, "Listen, I'm going to deliver the people of Israel. I'm going to take them to a good land. I am going to take them to a land that have giants in it." He probably didn't say it like that. He said, "A place of the Canaanites and the Hittites and the Amorites and the Perizzites and the Hivites and the Jebusites." But later on we see when speaking to Moses, he said, "Listen, I want you to take them there. The same thing I promised before, I want you to carry them through and he described the same place to Moses. Subsequent to that, Moses would have passed. So Abraham would have passed. Moses would have passed and Joshua was on the scene. He said, "As I was with Moses, the promise is still the same. It doesn't matter that that that Moses died. The mission must be accomplished. I will come down myself and fulfill my word." &gt;&gt; Amen. So it doesn't matter the circumstance. It does matter once God promised it, it will come to pass. &gt;&gt; So he could use whoever he want. Amen. &gt;&gt; So here we see God made a promise to to Abraham &gt;&gt; to be able to possess a p a a certain inheritance to be able to to to inhabit a particular place. &gt;&gt; And at the same time he said listen it not finished yet. Moses I want you to take them out of Egypt and take them to the same place that I promised them that are promised that they will they they will be able to occupy and possess. Don't mind it have Canaanites and Hittites and Jebusites in it. That is still the promise that I made to you. &gt;&gt; And even if you die, &gt;&gt; I will raise up a man. This was Moses minister. And we still must complete the promise I made. I still want more people to come here and possess the land. So it doesn't matter if you worship tonight. It doesn't matter if you praise tonight. He will he will raise up persons to worship and praise. He will raise up his seeds. He will raise up the predestinated bride to to be able to take the word and accept it and hand IT THERE AND SLICE AND CUT. AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Speaking about Joshua in s we would see Jesus paragraph 32 brother Brandham said brother footprints is possession. &gt;&gt; Minister and brethren don't be afraid to put footprints where God has told you to go. Amen. It's possession. He told Joshua, "Everywhere the souls of your feet set, that's yours. &gt;&gt; Every promise he leave, every promise he laid down, EVERY PROMISE EXPRESSED, THAT'S YOURS. BUT YOU HAVE TO POSSESS IT. SO YOU HAVE TO STEP ON IT. YOU HAVE TO WALK ON IT. YOU HAVE TO GO and experience it." Amen. He said, "Don't back up. We take what God said and that's the truth. No matter what the opposition is, how great it seems, and how DIFFICULT IT SEEMS." THAT SOUND LIKE FIGHTING TO ME. IT SOUND LIKE YOU WILL FACE SOME RESISTANCE. IT SOUND LIKE listen that you need to stand and you need to withstand. It sounds like you can't just be on the defense. You need to be on the attack BECAUSE HE SAY NO MATTER HOW GREAT THE OPPOSITION SEEMS, HOW DIFFICULT IT SEEMS, IF GOD SAID SO, IT'S YOURS. &gt;&gt; So healing is MINE TONIGHT, IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT THE DOCTORS SAY. &gt;&gt; LISTEN, listen to this. It says when he gave it to Joshua, he never said, "I'll take all all the Habites and Philistines and give it to you." Joshua had to fight for every inch. &gt;&gt; Every inch of ground. But God was with him. And every inch of ground you'll cover, brother, to make footprints, you'll fight your way through. &gt;&gt; So, you're not going to become victorious WITHOUT A FIGHT. YOU HAVE TO FIGHT YOUR WAY through in order to possess this land. &gt;&gt; But take the sword of the spirit, brother, and move right on. Footprints is possession. No matter how simple, how triv listen, deliverance is yours tonight. You know, &gt;&gt; healing is yours tonight. BUT YOU HAVE TO POSSESS IT. YOU HAVE TO FIGHT BECAUSE LISTEN, Satan is not going to sit back and say, "Look, look, they're winning. Look, you see the sons of God are rising. You see, they're moving on to perfection. No, no, no, no, no. He's not going to rock back. Let's expose them tonight. He is going to do what it takes to derail you, to distract you, to discourage you, to frustrate you, to drive you, and and and make sure you have a mental health crisis. He want you to start to feel like you're going crazy. He want you START TO DOUBT. HE WANT YOU TO START TO live in fear. He want you to be overly CONCERNED ABOUT THINGS THAT MAY not concern you. Remember, his job is to steal, to kill, to destroy, to derail and distract. &gt;&gt; He want to steal your joy. &gt;&gt; He want to steal your peace tonight. &gt;&gt; He want to KILL YOUR POTENTIAL. &gt;&gt; HE want to kill your prayer life. He want to destroy your family. He want to destroy your marriage. He want to destroy your relationships. He is out to get you. He's not going to leave you alone. When he talk about Job, what he say? He was moving to and fro. He was busy. Listen, he not taking vacation or no. He not taking time off and sick leave. The devil is seeking to see who he could devour. He's seeing who he could attack. He is coming to to look for chinks IN YOUR ARMOR. HE'S COMING TO see where you have weak points. He's coming to ensure that he could probe you and poke YOU AND MAKE YOU UNCOMFORTABLE. That that's his role. &gt;&gt; We not vex for that or know that's him doing his role. &gt;&gt; That's what he's doing. But listen, greater is he that is in you tonight. &gt;&gt; God has promised that listen, no matter what the opposition looks like, you will be victorious. &gt;&gt; You will overcome. You know why? The battle is not yours. When David saw Goliath, Goliath seemed like a great opposition. He seemed LIKE A BIG BAD WOLF, A BIG OPPOSITION COMING AGAINST THE ARMIES of the living God. AND DAVID SAW HIM AND SAY, "LISTEN, when he got a revelation that the battle was the Lord, they said David ran in haste. HE WAS SO CONVINCED. HE HAD A TESTIMONY. He had a A PERSONAL REVELATION THAT THIS BATTLE WASN'T AGAINST FLESH AND BLOOD. THIS BATTLE WAS ORCHESTRATED BY JEHOVAH. AND GUESS WHAT? IF YOU FAST FORWARD THIS FILM, Jesus gets the victory. &gt;&gt; Victory belongs to Jesus. He is the mighty conqueror. He is the prince of peace. HE'S THE EVERLASTING FATHER. HE'S THE LILY OF THE VALLEY. HE IS THE ROSE OF SHARON. HE IS THE BRIGHT AND MORNING STAR. SO NO DEMON, NO DEVIL, LISTEN, NO SATAN COULD COME AND defeat you. HE COULD CHALLENGE YOU. HE COULD STAND UP AGAINST YOU. HE COULD OPPOSE YOU. HE COULD TRY TO SHAKE YOU AND SHIFT YOU AND THROW YOU OFF. BUT HE WILL NOT GET THE VICTORY. Victory belongs to Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Listen. Moses Moses had a commission. He went and he saw the burning bush. And God said, "Listen, I've heard the cries of my people." And we know the story. We heard it over and over. I've heard the cries of my people, but keep in mind, he still had a promise. He promised to deliver them and carry them to this land. &gt;&gt; Since Abrahamic days, he said, "Listen, this is the place you will occupy. This is the place your seed will occupy. This is THE PLACE THAT THAT generation after generation will occupy. You may not see it today, but I see it by vision and I could tell YOU THEY'LL OCCUPY IT. BY FAITH, I KNOW THEY'LL OCCUPY IT. SO Moses was commissioned to bring them out of Egypt because he said they will sjourn in a strange land as slaves. &gt;&gt; So they spent 400 years in slavery. The thing about it, I have a feeling that because of the experience between Moses and Pharaoh, Pharaoh had to know. He had to know that something was up when this excon, this ex criminal came and said, "Let my people go." Because normal people don't do that. &gt;&gt; Criminals tend to hide. They want to be obscure. They want to to live in the shadows. So for this man to boldly come and say listen I am sent me. Let my people go with boldness AND CONFIDENCE. PHARAOH HAD TO KNOW THAT THIS MAN WAS SERIOUS. THIS MAN HAD AN EXPERIENCE WITH GOD. SO I KNOW YOUR BOSS HAVE TO KNOW THAT AFTER ALL THEY DO. WHEN YOU WALK WITH CONFIDENCE, WHEN YOU WALK IN POWER, KNOWING THAT YOU HAD AN EXPERIENCE WITH GOD, YOUR NEIGHBOR HAD TO KNOW THERE WAS SOMETHING DIFFERENT ABOUT YOU. YOUR FAMILY AND YOUR FRIENDS HAD TO KNOW THAT SOMETHING WAS DIFFERENT. THAT YOU WEREN'T THE SAME AS YOU WAS YESTERDAY. YOU MAY NOT BE what you want to be, BUT THEY KNOW YOU'RE NOT WHAT YOU USED to be. Amen. PHARAOH HAD TO KNOW SOMETHING WAS DIFFERENT. IMAGINE. Just imagine for a second Moses came and you saw one plague. You see water turn to blood. YOU SEE FLIES. YOU SEE FROST. YOU SEE BOILS AND so on. Plague after plague after plague. I think it's safe to say it would be safe to assume that Moses knew the time was at hand. Moses knew this wasn't normal living. Moses knew that God was fixing to move plague after plague. He may have been surprised at first. He see the snake. He see the rod turn to a snake. &gt;&gt; He himself, he would look on and he say, "Listen, this is not the norm. This is not what I'm ACCUSTOMED TO. SOMETHING HAVE TO HAPPEN. THIS IS COMING TO A CLIMAX." But but just picture Pharaoh now. Pharaoh was observing. He noticed, okay, Moses staff turned into a snake and ate up the snakes of his men. From a distance, he saw the water turned to blood. From a distance, he saw flies and frogs and so on. He saw plague after plague, and he saw the climax when the firstborn was being killed. He would have witnessed this. And as a man that would have studied because you couldn't be Pharaoh Jessu. You had to go to school. You had to have tutors. You had to have governors. You had to study history and mathematics and leadership. Amen. After all that, can you imagine? He looked at them and he said, "You know what? This is it. Go ahead. Go ahead. Go ahead. I give up. This is the last straw. There's nothing more I could do. But remember, &gt;&gt; victory belongs to Jesus. &gt;&gt; God is not satisfied with the enemy giving up. &gt;&gt; I don't serve a God that allows you to win by default. &gt;&gt; He don't want your win by default. He don't want the enemy didn't show up so by default you get the victory. &gt;&gt; The enemy get little fed up and allow you to go. No. So here's what the Bible said. In the Bible it said God hardened the heart of Pharaoh. Because God had a point to prove. &gt;&gt; He wanted beyond a shadow of a doubt like in court where they say beyond reasonable doubt. He wanted to ensure &gt;&gt; that you know that I know that this is God business. &gt;&gt; This is not by might. This is not by my power and MY STRENGTH BUT BY his spirit. AND AS SUCH HE HARDENED THE HEART OF PHARAOH and he said you know what I know I tell them to go ahead I tell them take everything I tell them take the cattle take the you know all the beasts take all their belongings take the clothes the shoes whatever they could move with I tell them to go because I felt it was about time to do so but when God hardened his heart &gt;&gt; there was a change at that point &gt;&gt; God was just getting started. You know, you may have thought it was about the plaguesh, but this was the final showdown. &gt;&gt; A final showdown has to come. &gt;&gt; It's not for your natural eye to see, but God was setting up this play to get checkmate in a game of chess. He wasn't playing checkers. He wanted checkmate. So, he said, "Listen, let me harden his heart. Let me allow him and read the Bible. It says Pharaoh got every chariot he could find. He didn't take a few, you know, he didn't take some some supervisory chariots, just three or four to chase them down and watch them. No, it say he got all. And he got men. He got captains. He got men with leadership qualities, trained, experienced men to ride THESE CHARIOTS AND FOLLOW THEM into the sea. &gt;&gt; But you see, God made a way. And when God made a way for you, that way was predestinated for you. It wasn't predestinated for the enemy. But what he created for you was for you to escape. That way of escape was really destruction of THE ENEMY. THAT'S WHY IT WENT ON TO say the Egyptians you see today, you're going to see no more forever. SO YOU MEAN TO TELL ME THE WAY I FEEL TODAY, I'm not going to feel anymore. The thing that held you bound, THE THING THAT HELD YOU CAPTIVE, TODAY IS THE LAST DAY FOR THAT. YOU MEAN THAT DEPRESSION HAVE TO GO TODAY? YOU MEAN THAT FRUSTRATION HAVE TO GO TODAY? YOU MEAN THAT THAT FEELING OF GREED, THAT FEELING OF ANXIETY, THAT FEELING OF BACKBITING, THAT FEELING OF FRUSTRATION HAVE to disappear today forever? He could do it. HE DID IT FOR THEM. HE TELL THEM, "LISTEN, WATCH FOR THEM." You see them? You see those Egyptians? The ones that used to beat you. The ones you thought you had to slave over. THE ONES YOU THOUGHT YOU had to serve forever, as of today, YOU'RE GOING TO SEE THEM NO MORE. FOREVER. It went on to say, Moses said, listen to Moses now in Exodus 14 verse 13. And I love this. He say, fear not. Fear ye not. Stand still. In other words, this is not about you. This is not about you and what you do and and you feeling to move a particular way. He says stand still. See the salvation of the Lord &gt;&gt; which he will show you today, &gt;&gt; not tomorrow. Today for the Egyptians whom you have seen today, you shall see them again no MORE FOREVER. BUT VERSE 14, here's what it says. THE LORD SHALL FIGHT for you and ye shall hold your peace. So that tells me, LISTEN, THIS BATTLE IS NOT AGAINST FLESH AND BLOOD. IT'S NOT ABOUT YOUR STRENGTH AND YOUR MIGHT. IT'S NOT ABOUT YOUR POWER AND how you feel. He will do the battle for you. ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS GET STARTED AND HE WILL do the rest. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It reminds me of the three Hebrew boys. No matter what in scripture, WHEN YOU'RE ABOUT TO GET THE VICTORY, &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH, &gt;&gt; they turn up the heat a little bit. They turn up the fight a little bit. &gt;&gt; The three Hebrew boys were were boys. &gt;&gt; They serve the Lord with innocence. &gt;&gt; They believe what they believe by faith and they held on to that. &gt;&gt; They stood firmly on that. &gt;&gt; When challenged and the king said, "Listen, if you don't bow down, we're going to heat the furnace seven times hotter." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Come on. &gt;&gt; They stood their ground. &gt;&gt; They stood up. They probably considered what he said and said, "Listen, I think this is an appropriate response. The God we serve is more than able to deliver us. But in the event in the unlikely event in the given the circumstance if for any particular reason perhaps there is some kind of flaw in our communication today and he's unable to come and deliver us. We have decided that we are still not going to bow to your request. We are not going to bow to worship you. We are not going to serve you how you believe we should. We are not going to go in the places you think we should. We're not going to drink your drinks. We're not going to eat your food. We going to stand our position because this is what we believe. So, we're not GOING TO CUT OUR HAIR. WE'RE NOT GOING TO WEAR THE MINISKIRT BECAUSE WE HAVE DECIDED THAT EVEN IF you don't deliver, we are not going to give in. We not going to GIVE UP. WE'RE NOT GOING TO BACK DOWN. WE'RE GOING TO STAND ON OUR FAITH. STAND IN OUR belief because WE BELIEVE THAT THE PROMISE WE HOLD ON TO IS MADE BY GOD AND IF GOD COULD PROMISE IT, HE WILL BRING IT TO PASS. SO WE SAYING HERE UNTIL BETTER COME WE STANDING on this AND GUESS WHAT WE KNOW THE STORY BEFORE LONG THEY SAY THE MEN who threw them in were burnt. IT WAS SO HOT THEY THEMSELVES WERE BURNT. But when there was the FOURTH MAN IN THE FIRE and the king ordered them to come out, they said not even the smoke was ON THEM. THEY SAID NOT EVEN THE SMELL OF SMOKE WAS ON THEIR CLOTHES. He is such AN AWESOME GOD. HE IS SUCH A PROTECTOR. HE WANTED TO ENSURE THAT MAN COULDN'T TAKE THE GLORY. HE WANTED TO ENSURE THAT MAN COULDN'T TAKE THE PRAISE. So when they WALK BACK OUT, THEY COULD WALK IN CONFIDENCE KNOWING THAT THIS victory belonged to Jesus. THAT NO MATTER WHAT, NO MATTER WHAT THE OPPOSITION, NO MATTER WHAT THE CIRCUMSTANCE, HE IS GOING to deliver. THEY MAY HAVE HAD A FIGHT. THEY MAY HAVE HAD OPPOSITION, but he is able to DELIVER THEM AND BRING THEM THROUGH. AMEN. &gt;&gt; At the end of the day, nobody said it was going to be easy. &gt;&gt; You weren't promised a easy ride, a easy journey. God has no spoiled children. It's natural for us to say, you know, child, you know, I love you so much. And you lift them up and you give them things. And God loves you, &gt;&gt; but he don't love your shipping. &gt;&gt; He want you to be trained. So, it's one thing to be a son. And yes, you're a son and you're a daughter and that sounds good. But when it comes to adoption, &gt;&gt; he don't just take you and pull you through and say, "Hey, that's my son, so you get a pass." He said, "No, he put you under tutors and governors. He give you classes and guidance cuz he want you to have wisdom. He want you to have experience." It even says Jesus learns. He had to learn obedience by the things that he suffered. &gt;&gt; He had to go through. And guess what he said? To as many as I love, I rebuke and chasen. &gt;&gt; So he don't want you to say the same and just say, "Bless me, Lord. I'm I'm good. I'm fine." No. He said, "Listen, if you bring forth fruit, he want to prune you. He want to cut you. He want to bend you because he want you to bring forth more fruit. He want productivity. He want multiplication. He want to see YOU CAN APPLY THE PROMISES TO YOUR life and see abundance. HE SAID, "I CAME THAT YOU MIGHT have life and HAVE IT MORE ABUNDANTLY, NOT LIVE LIKE everybody else." &gt;&gt; He want you to live a particular way. He wanted to walk a particular way. Amen. &gt;&gt; David, sorry, Daniel. Daniel, &gt;&gt; was an interesting guy. Yes. &gt;&gt; He had such a close relationship with God that he prayed all the time. &gt;&gt; You pray all the time. Daniel prayed and and you know what it says? It says while he prayed, the angel of of the Lord was fighting. &gt;&gt; It said not without a fight. The angel didn't just come and say, "Daniel, because of you, I just want to show up on the scene." No. The angel had to fight serious demons to come &gt;&gt; in order to come to his rescue, to come to his aid. He had to do something and the angel was working on the next side. &gt;&gt; So he had to pray and the angel had to fight. IF HE STOPPED PRAYING, the angel stopped fighting. So what you think we have to do? &gt;&gt; What about us? &gt;&gt; The victory is guaranteed or know &gt;&gt; but not without a fight. YOU HAVE A JOB TO DO. You have a task and a role to do. You have something to do tonight. You have something to do tomorrow. Right? Like Daniel in a in a message at thy word, paragraph 54, it said, "So what happened?" Here's what it was. The angel of the Lord who had spoke the word was coming through the neighborhood confirming his word. &gt;&gt; See, sometimes they can't get on a spury moment. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So you pray and you didn't hear the answer today. So what sometimes they can't come at the spur of the moment Daniel prayed the angel said it was 21 days I believe before is that right before he got to him now we must remember it's God but when God had said anything it's the truth &gt;&gt; hold right onto IT IT'S GOT TO HAPPEN IF you're weakened then unbelief will take over but you stay with the word of God you remember that guy came through the prayer line brother Brian ministry and he said, "You're going to see." He was blind and he came back and he had doubt in his heart and his faith had none to hold on to. And he sold the paper and say, "Extra, extra, read all about it." Familiar story. And while in the barber shop, he was just anointing his feet, &gt;&gt; anointing it, anointing it, anointing it. It wasn't easy, you know. He didn't come through a prayer line and he walk out, I could see, blessed be the name of the Lord. He had a process to go through &gt;&gt; and while he was anointing it and testifying about it, it happened like that. &gt;&gt; All of a sudden it happened. &gt;&gt; After a while, all of a sudden it happened. So Daniel was praying and the angel was fighting and all of a sudden the angel show up and it happened. But it took A FIGHT. IT TOOK a process. It took some work to get there. &gt;&gt; What about you and I tonight? Listen, when Jacob &gt;&gt; was a shy, right? He was a smart man, as we would say. When Jacob was around, listen, he wanted the birthright. As we know, &gt;&gt; Jacob thought he was the smartest man around. &gt;&gt; Until he had to come come face to face with himself. &gt;&gt; There came a time in which he said, "You know what? I want to appease my brother Esau cuz I know what I did. I know myself. I could look in the mirror and I know I know good. I'd do what I had to do. I know it didn't sound right. It didn't look good, but this is me being me. Still thinking in his humanness, he said, "Listen, let me send some gifts. Let me send some presents. Let me see if I could appease my brother because I feel my brother hate me. I feel he don't like me. I feel he had problems with me." And for good reason. I know what I did and he know what I did. He even sent different camps out and he said listen present him with presents and tell him I just behind send one out two out three out it didn't matter how much you sent know Esau not budging because this is my wicked brother &gt;&gt; this is my brother who steal the birthright who fake and forge his way into getting it. So he have a serious problem until one day &gt;&gt; the Bible gives an account and says he sent his wife, his family, his his cattle, everything away. And the Bible says Jacob was left alone. He alone just like you and I alone. But it didn't stop there. When he was left alone, he had to come face to face with himself. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Alone. Amen. &gt;&gt; At some point you will come face to face with yourself &gt;&gt; alone. No matter how busy you are, no matter how much you run and you hide and you play and you fuss, you have to come face to face with yourself. &gt;&gt; You and you alone. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And at that moment, he realized how fickle he was, how weak he was, how undone he was. And he had an experience with an angel. It says he wrestled all night. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he was determined. He was resilient. He listen, no matter what happened, he wasn't going to let go. It said the angel pushed and ensured that listen, his hip was out of joint and he still wasn't letting go. The daytime was coming. Day was about to break and he's still not letting go. &gt;&gt; Talk about fight. THIS IS THE FIGHT HE HAD TO GO THROUGH. &gt;&gt; He and the angel alone. He said, "Listen, I not even letting you go under any circumstance unless you bless me because I reached the point where I realized I can't go to church and go back home the same way anymore. I can't go to church every Sunday and Wednesday and Friday and convention and and this and that and the other anymore. Tonight, tonight, tonight, I'm not going to let you GO UNTIL YOU BLESS ME." LIKE THAT MAN WHO SAID, "IF YOU DON'T CENTER IN, YOU'RE GOING TO FIND MY BONES RIGHT HERE. &gt;&gt; UNTIL YOU BLESS ME, I'M NOT GOING TO LET YOU GO. I'm not going to leave you alone." &gt;&gt; Until the angel could say, "Listen, &gt;&gt; take win. &gt;&gt; We started to fight as Jacob, &gt;&gt; but you're going to have a name change. &gt;&gt; You're going to be Israel from now on." After that experience, you could have seen this wasn't the same man that went into the fight. &gt;&gt; This wasn't the same man that was face to face with himself because he had an individual experience by himself with the angel. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Jesus in the garden of Gethsemane &gt;&gt; and we know the story prophets that that is where he conquered. That is where he understood that it wasn't about him. It wasn't about his will. It wasn't about his feelings and his his experience and how traumatic it would have been to have been crucified. He knew he came for a purpose. He knew he came to be that bridge to ensure that we could accept redemption. &gt;&gt; He knew his blood had to be shed. So he say listen if it were possible &gt;&gt; let this cup pass &gt;&gt; but not my will &gt;&gt; that was a fight for him. &gt;&gt; Now he was going to get the victory you know &gt;&gt; but not without a fight &gt;&gt; not without a fight. &gt;&gt; No matter what happened he knew the mission had to be completed. He had to go and die for us &gt;&gt; for you and I. It wasn't by any means a easy walk. It wasn't an easy journey. IT WASN'T WITHOUT A FIGHT. BUT HE HAD TO GO through to get the victory. &gt;&gt; He couldn't get the victory just walking and talking and having a good time. IT HAD TO COME TO A FINAL SHOWDOWN WHEN HE COULD come face to face with death itself. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; At that point, the mighty conqueror had prevailed &gt;&gt; on the cross. &gt;&gt; When they pierced it side and blood dripped down, he had the victory. &gt;&gt; The victory belonged to Jesus. No matter what, when the the skies turned black and the earth quaked and shook under the presence of Almighty God, the victory was won for you and I. That's why we here tonight. &gt;&gt; But it took a sacrifice. It took a price. This message is dripping with blood. When you think about it, through the dark ages, they try to boil it out. They try to burn it at the stake. They tried to even crucify them. They stoned them. They beat them, kill them. But you know what? They couldn't kill that seed. &gt;&gt; They couldn't kill that predestinated seed from coming forth &gt;&gt; no MATTER WHAT. NO MATTER HOW THEY FIGHT AND TRIED TO CRUSH IT, &gt;&gt; LUTHER FOUGHT and Wesley fought. THE PENTECOSTALS FOUGHT, BROTHER BRANDHAM FOUGHT. &gt;&gt; What about you and I in this day? &gt;&gt; WE HAVE TO FIGHT. NOT WITHOUT A FIGHT TONIGHT. &gt;&gt; There is no easy wins. There's no easy victory. We're not going to be victorious by chance. And we happen to get a good run. Listen, the the the enemy was real weak. You know, we went and beat them up. No, listen. The devices of the enemy are the crosshairs on you. you know, &gt;&gt; well trained on you. You know, if you don't have that full armor like Ephesians 6 describes, you're in trouble. You know, &gt;&gt; YOU HAVE TO HAVE the helmet of salvation, &gt;&gt; the sword of the spirit, the shield of faith. You have to be listen, you need to be dressed for the occasion. This is not a jokey army. Listen, no, nobody enters the army because they they want to learn to match. That is for that is for cub scouts and school and thing you like to march so you doing march pass that that sports thing when it come to battle is training or no &gt;&gt; the objective of joining the army they don't enlist you and recruit you and they come and they make you run for miles and they tell you look discipline march push-ups handle guns whatever it is is not because they want independence parade or no they do that because They want you to be able to defend yourself and they want you to be able to attack. &gt;&gt; They know when called upon you need to be prepared. &gt;&gt; Just like cub scout motors always be prepared. When the army recruits you and they put you through training is because they want in the event that they have to sound the alarm. You are well trained and you're ready. &gt;&gt; Once you hear a certain sound, you could respond. Just like the army of the Lord, the Christian soldiers, God wants, he want them well trained. &gt;&gt; He want them disciplined because there's going to be a final showdown. &gt;&gt; THERE'S GOING TO BE A BATTLE. &gt;&gt; There is no way the the devil is not going to sit back and watch you and say them guys real well. No, look how they're walking up every step to perfection. &gt;&gt; No, no, no, no, no. &gt;&gt; Remember the devil believe and tremble, you know. &gt;&gt; Yes. So as he see you trying to to listen, I want to to expand my faith. I want to practice the presence of God. I want to imp drawn closer to to the Lord. I want to delve deeper in the word. As you're doing that, listen, he have arrows. He have darts. He have all kind of thing he going to send your way. You know, &gt;&gt; he want to mash you up and know. &gt;&gt; He want to kill you if he can. But you are predestinated to beat him anywhere, any place, any under any condition, NO MATTER WHAT THE CIRCUMSTANCE, you were predestinated before the foundation of the world to conquer that. You know, &gt;&gt; you see a eagle is a eagle no matter what. &gt;&gt; Even in a cage, a eagle is a eagle. &gt;&gt; The behavior is a is the same. &gt;&gt; Even a wounded eagle is a eagle. or no &gt;&gt; when they see the storm they don't say they see me I really tired of this eagle thing I want to be a vulture I want to be a dove no it don't work so no it's innate innate means built in it's something in the inside that you can't take away the same way it's it's built into a believer have faith it built into the eagle TO STORE SO ABOVE THE STORM ABOVE THE CIRCUMSTANCE ABOVE YOUR CHALLENGE ABOVE YOUR PROBLEM BECAUSE YOU WERE BORN AN EAGLE LISTEN, you may have been caged for a while. You may have been tied up for a while, but when you hear mother eagle call, &gt;&gt; you know how to respond. &gt;&gt; Just Sunday, brother preach. He said, "Listen, a cat says meow. &gt;&gt; A dog says roof. &gt;&gt; You can't make the dog say meow." No, &gt;&gt; the roof is built in. &gt;&gt; The meow is built into the cat. So the eagle it's built in the DNA that when the storm come I don't want to stay here as a matter of fact from birth when mother eagle decide to take it for that listen that virgin trip that very first experience and the wind blowing through the wings and the wings not quite strong enough they know it's builtin to fly you know when the mother eagle throw them off and shake them off mother eagle know that's my boy that's my girl At some point they will learn to fly. When they they they BRUSH ALL THE FEATHERS out the nest and make them uncomfortable and uneasy. They're not waiting and you come to church going to get a little juice or you got Bible or you get a hopspread. No, you know you come and you could take the word and you could hand it there AND YOU KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH IT. YOU KNOW WHEN to move. You listen, YOU'RE SPIRITUALLY MATURE. AT THAT STAGE, the mother eagle could watch you because THEY KNOW YOU TRIP OFF THE OLD BLOCK. YOU'RE JUST LIKE ME because it's built in. It doesn't go eagle school to learn to fly. You know, a bird doesn't run down the runway and take off like a plane because it's built in to operate a particular way. Just like that. You are eagle tonight. The fight IS BUILT IN. YOU ARE A BELIEVER TONIGHT. THE FIGHT IS BUILT IN. YOUR MISSION must be completed. IN A LITTLE WHILE, WE'LL REVISIT THE MISSION BECAUSE IT MUST BE COMPLETED. GOD DOESN'T START THINGS and don't finish. I showed you through history. He's told Abraham, "Listen, the land where the Canaanites and Jebusites and Hivites and Amorites are, that's where my people will be. THAT'S WHERE I'LL carry them." By the way, Abraham just had a son. Then, you know, &gt;&gt; he just almost sacrificed Isaac. And the angel say, "Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. I know you believe ME SO MUCH &gt;&gt; THAT YOU'RE willing to do &gt;&gt; exactly as I say &gt;&gt; in obedience to the word &gt;&gt; so I trust you. &gt;&gt; I could show you more." &gt;&gt; Later on, when he told Moses, "Deliver my people, &gt;&gt; the promise was still unfolding." You know, &gt;&gt; it didn't matter time. So I know you read the quotes and you say but you know the quotes say and we in 2025 but you know it didn't matter. &gt;&gt; It's still the word &gt;&gt; the promise is the same yesterday, today and forever. &gt;&gt; His word don't change and God can't lie. &gt;&gt; So think about that. &gt;&gt; So the manifestation &gt;&gt; has to be close. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham came to restore the faith. Yes sir. And I believe in the message of contest he said raise up mighty men, &gt;&gt; mighty warriors of the faith. &gt;&gt; Warriors of the faith. He didn't say raise up men who could just go through the motion. The difference between a warrior and a warrior &gt;&gt; is the ability to fight. You know, &gt;&gt; warriors are men of war. &gt;&gt; Are those who listen, they trained for this thing. &gt;&gt; They polishing boots whole day. They know to draw their sword quickly. &gt;&gt; They know the gun clean and loaded. They don't have to wonder, you know, I did that some time ago. I remember some time ago they talk about the virtues, you know, but I just can't put my finger on it. Not like that. They sharpen like mercenaries know. So, brother say, "Listen, raise up them kind of men in this hour because they have a job TO DO. THERE'S A FINAL show coming and he saved this battle for his best men for his best SONS AND DAUGHTERS THAT ARE TRAINED TO handle the word. Amen. He wants a church without spot or wrinkle. He looking for perfection and adoption. He looking to see those who could go THROUGH THE PROCESS, NOT LOOKING FOR THE SHORTCUT, WHO COULD UNDERSTAND the sacrifice and walk through, COULD UNDERSTAND THE FIGHT. And you spot the devil wherever he coming and you know you're ready for him. Just like David, listen, they say David didn't just run to Goliath. He run towards the army. I wasn't sure what he was up to. But he was so convinced he was going because he knew it wasn't him. He knew it was the Lord. He knew the Lord was with him. He was empowered to do what he did. It didn't matter if he swing slow, swing fast, if it was a big stone or small stone. Goliath was bound to fall. No matter what happened, your challenge tonight bound to be defeated or your your problem, your mind battle bound to fall because it's not about you, BUT YOUR FAITH IN HIS WORD, YOUR FAITH IN HIS PROMISE GOING TO MAKE IT MANIFEST. In the fourth seal it say wait till them seven thunders utter THEIR VOICES TO THAT group who really can take the word and hand IT THERE IT'LL SLICE AND CUT and it'll close THE HEAVEN. AMEN. THAT'S THE KIND OF GROUP WE'RE looking for. The group that could make a church that could make a REVIVAL THAT SIN CAN'T EVEN WALK IN IT. That listen if the sick come they will be healed. That nobody will leave the same way that THEY CAME. THAT'S WHAT we looking for. This battle is not yours. I'm not asking you to pick up arms. I'm asking you to pick up faith. I'm asking you to pick up virtue and knowledge and temperance and patience and add godliness and brotherly kindness and charity, the absolutes to your life. So you'll realize it's not against flesh AND BLOOD, BUT AGAINST PRINCIPALITIES, against powers, AGAINST RULERS OF DARKNESS of this world, against spiritual wickedness IN HIGH PLACES. THAT'S WHAT WE FIGHTING AGAINST. The musician could get ready in in in the message, the greatest battle ever fought. Paragraph 149, it says, "The great hour of charge is at hand. It's not TIME TO PLAY. IT'S NOT TIME TO SLACK OFF. IT'S NOT TIME TO RELAX BECAUSE THE GREAT HOUR OF CHARGE IS AT HAND. HALLELUJAH. Soldier with armors gleaming, colors streaming, faith and doubt is setting yourself in array in this tabernacle this morning. And I said tonight, doubt on one side, faith on the other. Soldiers, stand at your POST OF DUTY. THAT'S YOUR COMMISSION. THAT'S the mission TO ENSURE THAT WHEN THE SON OF MAN COMES HE COULD FIND THE SAME FAITH THAT WAS RESTORED UNTO THE SAINTS THAT when the holy spirit come that you could be magnetized to that absolute YOU CAN BE MAGNETIZED TO THAT WORD. &gt;&gt; Listen it said soldier stand at your post of duty. Hallelujah. Our captain the morning star leads on. He never goes back. HE NEVER, HE DON'T KNOW THE word retreat. WE'RE NOT HERE TO BACK DOWN. WE HERE TO STAND UP AND FACE THE DEVIL EYE TO EYE, MANTO MAN WITH YOUR SWORD DRAWN WITH YOUR SWORD DRAWN BECAUSE YOU'RE READY FOR WAR. YOU'RE READY TO FIGHT BECAUSE YOU WANT THE VICTORY. You're not going to just sit down and wait for SOMETHING TO HAPPEN, BUT YOU'RE GOING TO CAUSE SOMETHING TO HAPPEN. IT SAYS certainly the greatest battle ever fought. She is going on right IN HERE NOW, SIR. YES, SIR. Between life and death. Between sickness, you can play sound something softly. Between sickness and health, between faith and doubt. Oh my.
