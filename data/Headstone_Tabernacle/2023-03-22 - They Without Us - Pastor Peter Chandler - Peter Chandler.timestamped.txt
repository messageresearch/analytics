[38:29] book of Hebrews
[38:31] brother Ben says the Hebrews book is a
[38:35] yellowish green
[38:37] the color of the pillar of fire
[38:40] and it's a great book
[38:43] Hebrews 11. I've often wondered this
[38:47] he said in the last chapter it's the
[38:51] last part of the 11th chapter when it
[38:55] talks about Abraham
[38:57] the great faith chapter

[1:04:15] because that's the last one because
[1:04:19] he did his part yeah
[1:04:21] please ask me where to find the quote he
[1:04:25] introduced
[1:04:26] amen Christine he introduced it this is
[1:04:31] introducing
[1:04:32] he said the next is intelligence amen
[1:04:38] we have no intelligence
[1:04:41] of our own the new man is his
[1:04:44] feet
[1:04:48] the lips and then the eyes
[1:04:56] just the intelligence
[1:04:58] Jesus did nothing except the father
[1:05:01] showed it
[1:05:03] the intelligence
[1:05:06] is the intelligence and we have no
[1:05:09] intelligence
[1:05:11] it's his intelligence we have no sight
[1:05:14] of our own how can a man foresee he
[1:05:18] can't do that it's God himself it's
[1:05:21] coming a place he's governed the body
[1:05:23] all the way through all the way through
[1:05:25] all the way through then the complete
[1:05:27] body of Christ
[1:05:35] it is the intelligence
[1:05:38] Christ that's the next step he says what
[1:05:42] is it God walking on two feet
[1:05:44] footsteps of the righteous is ordered
[1:05:49] of the Lord amen amen amen I'm walking
[1:05:53] because the intelligence is

[1:06:21] need the Intelligence
[1:06:24] on the right side then you will catch
[1:06:28] all the fish you want so let's go a bit
[1:06:31] deeper here
[1:06:32] in Hebrews they could not be perfect
[1:06:36] without us because the hands
[1:06:42] cannot be perfect without the brain

[1:06:52] then the building's completely but you
[1:06:54] might complain you can't see a as

[1:09:04] intelligence mind of Christ perfect and
[1:09:09] finishes the bride when his mind the
[1:09:14] bride will do nothing
[1:09:18] then she will move
[1:09:34] the true bride Church the true bright
[1:09:39] Church anybody can say I'm in the
[1:09:41] message
[1:09:42] but the true bright Church comes to the
[1:09:46] headstones
