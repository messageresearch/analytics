[12:59] God bless you and again tonight welcome
[13:02] thanks for taking this
[13:05] pause
[13:07] tonight I'll give you my title for this
[13:10] call called a House of
[13:14] Prayer called a house of
[13:17] prayer and I want to start by reading
[13:19] this before I read the scriptures
[13:21] brother brand I was a little I was a
[13:23] little boy first recognition I have it
[13:27] in my book it'll be all pretty soon
[13:30] my mother's own words concering what
[13:32] taking place a little cabin the morning
[13:35] when I first
[13:37] came I never come here by my own power
[13:41] you never come by your own power I never
[13:44] knew when I was coming I don't know when
[13:47] I'm leaving none of us do we may yet
[13:51] some of us may leave the world before
[13:53] the night is over I do not
[13:55] know but I was 7 years old I was in
[13:59] water from a well and a voice spoke to
[14:02] me out of a bush as a whirlwind in a
[14:05] bush and said don't never
[14:08] smoke or
[14:10] drink or defile your body in any way
[14:14] they'll be a work to do when you get
[14:18] older I said that is sacred let me
[14:22] repeat that part he was just seven years
[14:24] old and a voice said don't never smoke
[14:27] or drink or defile your body in any way
[14:32] there'll be a work to do when you get
[14:35] older so tonight to scriptures Isaiah
[14:39] 567 and Matthew 211 12-13 Isaiah 567
[14:46] says even them will I bring to my Holy
[14:50] Mountain and make them joyful In My
[14:53] House of
[14:54] Prayer their burnt offerings and their
[14:57] sacrifices shall be accepted upon mine
[15:00] Altar for mine house shall be called a
[15:05] house of prayer for all
[15:08] people Matthew 21 12 and 11
[15:13] 12-13 and Jesus went into the temple of
[15:18] God and cast out all of them that sold
[15:24] and bought in the temple and overthrew
[15:27] the tables of the money Changers and the
[15:30] seats of them that so does and said unto
[15:34] them it is written my house shall be
[15:38] called The House of
[15:40] Prayer but you have made it end of of
[15:44] Thieves may God bless his word so Jesus
[15:46] actually was referring to that scripture
[15:49] in
[15:50] Isaiah so Jesus knew the word and his
[15:54] action and his
[15:56] expression and all that he did was a
[15:59] reflection of what the scriptures are
[16:02] prophesied so what Jesus was saying to
[16:06] them is that this house that is to be a
[16:10] House of Prayer you have defiled it by
[16:14] what you do in
[16:16] it I want you to think about these words
[16:19] a House of Prayer being
[16:23] defiled by what you
[16:25] do now we want to
[16:27] show you you as that house not a
[16:31] physical
[16:32] building your body now what is
[16:35] defilement what is defilement the act of
[16:38] making something F Duty or
[16:41] unclean the violation of something
[16:44] considered secret or the act of making
[16:48] something ceremonially
[16:51] impure
[16:52] defilement spoiling something or someone
[16:56] so that is less beautiful or pure
[17:01] corrupting the Purity or Perfection of
[17:04] something making something physically
[17:07] unclean with something
[17:10] unpleasant or
[17:13] contaminated so defilement refers to the
[17:17] act of making something impure unclean
[17:20] Unholy either physically morally
[17:22] spiritually it often denotes a state of
[17:26] separation from God due to sin unclean
[17:30] actions or association with something
[17:34] considered unclean or
[17:37] profane now Jesus in Mark 7 verse 20 he
[17:43] said these words he said that which
[17:45] cometh out of the man that defileth the
[17:50] man I want you to think about the man
[17:53] being your body being your house for
[17:56] from within or out of the heart of men
[17:59] proceed evil thoughts
[18:02] adulteries
[18:04] fornications murders tests
[18:08] covetousness wickedness deceit
[18:13] lishness and evil eye
[18:16] blasphemy Pride
[18:20] foolishness all these evil thing come
[18:24] from within and defile the man
[18:29] but BR some Ephesian Church AG he said
[18:32] the way of God is Holiness let it be
[18:34] known to every member here of the body
[18:37] of Christ until you live a holy life God
[18:42] refuses your
[18:44] sacrifice so think about it the house or
[18:48] the temple was a place to bring
[18:52] sacrifice to bring an offering to bring
[18:55] whether it's a bull or a goat or
[18:57] whatever it is it's a place is to bring
[18:59] a sacrifice unto God and here the
[19:02] prophet is saying let it be known to
[19:04] every member here of the body of Christ
[19:06] he's not talking to a church now he's
[19:08] not talking to a group he's speaking to
[19:11] the body of Christ that means this is
[19:12] international around the world until you
[19:15] live a holy life God refuses your
[19:19] sacrifice the sacrifice must be offered
[19:22] with holy hands the high priest before
[19:25] he could even come in to offer the
[19:26] sacrifice you had to be holy dedicated
[19:28] anointed perfume and everything and
[19:30] before you could even walk in the
[19:32] presence of God to offer the sacrifice
[19:33] is that right then here we go how can
[19:37] you go out here and cheat and steal and
[19:41] fuss and fight with your neighbors and
[19:44] everything else and carry on the way you
[19:46] do and then come in here and say oh Lord
[19:49] Praise Jesus Hallelujah so he's
[19:51] showing that your
[19:54] mindset has to adjust and change as to
[19:58] who God is and who his house is the
[20:02] question was asked what house will you
[20:05] build me and I want you to think now a
[20:09] house is built Brick by Brick cement
[20:13] gravel sand it is built and if he has to
[20:18] have a house of prayer it must also be
[20:21] built how you start how you come through
[20:27] in building this house because brother
[20:29] bam said he made praying a habit and you
[20:31] can also whe you're exercising whe in
[20:34] the bathroom and you're bathing whether
[20:35] you're on the streets traveling you can
[20:37] make this praying or have it you could
[20:39] be in your own Zone and you could be
[20:42] crying out unto God so let's
[20:45] continue now under the law I want to get
[20:49] an idea of how God saw it under the law
[20:54] this word
[20:56] defilement Leviticus 18
[21:00] 20 to
[21:02] 27 moreover thou shall not lie Carly
[21:05] with thy neighbor's wife to defile
[21:08] thyself with her Thou shalt not let any
[21:12] of thy seed pass through the fire of Mo
[21:15] neither shalt thou profane the name of
[21:17] thy God I am the Lord Thou shalt not lie
[21:22] with mankind as with
[21:24] womankind it is
[21:27] abomination neither shall thou lie with
[21:29] any Beast to defile thyself therewi
[21:32] neither shall any woman stand before a
[21:34] beast to lie down there there too it is
[21:38] confusion defile not ye yourselves in
[21:41] any of these things for in all these the
[21:45] nations are defiled which I cast down
[21:48] before you so he seeing these are the
[21:51] acts these are the performance of the
[21:52] nation and God cast them out verse 25
[21:56] and the land is defiled
[21:59] that's how God viewed that's God opinion
[22:01] of it not just the people but the land
[22:04] itself is defiled
[22:06] therefore I do visit the iniquity
[22:09] thereof upon it and the land itself
[22:12] vomited out
[22:14] inhabitants ye shall therefore keep my
[22:17] statutes and my judgments and shall not
[22:20] commit any of these Abominations neither
[22:23] any of you of your own Nation nor any
[22:26] stranger that sourth among you for all
[22:31] these Abominations have the men of the
[22:33] land done which were before you and the
[22:37] land is
[22:40] defiled so we want to go now in this
[22:43] terminology I'm using here about
[22:45] defiling the house Ezekiel
[22:48] 511 so just relax and just listen listen
[22:53] closely these are scriptures we never
[22:55] really touched before but I believe it's
[22:57] applicable now
[22:59] Ezekiel 511 States wherefore as I live
[23:02] sayeth the Lord God surely because thou
[23:05] has defile my Sanctuary with all thy
[23:08] detestable things and with all thine
[23:11] Abominations therefore will I also
[23:13] diminish thee neither shall my eyes
[23:16] spear neither shall I have any
[23:19] pity Jeremiah
[23:21] 7:30 for the children of Judah have done
[23:24] evil in my sight seeth the Lord they
[23:27] have set their abomination in the house
[23:30] which is called by my name to pollute it
[23:35] so this is not man's opinion this is
[23:38] God's opinion this is God's Viewpoint I
[23:41] say to you this way you have your
[23:44] thoughts I have my thoughts I may be
[23:47] wrong you might be right you might be
[23:49] wrong I might be right but it is
[23:51] irrelevant your thoughts and my thoughts
[23:54] what is most important is God thoughts
[23:59] you may have strong conviction about
[24:00] certain things that's okay that's fine
[24:04] but how does God see it and this is
[24:07] when we shake off the load of people's
[24:11] thoughts and ideas when we begin to look
[24:15] again and ask the question in our
[24:19] behavior in our attitude in our words
[24:23] how does God see this this is me and
[24:27] this is me I'm not talking about you
[24:29] because you are troubled all by yourself
[24:30] born in sin shap iniquity non rightous
[24:33] no not one we are wicked that's how God
[24:36] sees us that's why we come to Christ we
[24:37] are wicked we are evil that's why we
[24:40] repent and we bring our sins upon the
[24:42] altar that the cleansing blood could
[24:44] cleanse us to make us right there is
[24:47] none righteous no not one that's the
[24:48] word so we cannot approach it from our
[24:51] self righteous position we can't do that
[24:54] so let's let's continue
[24:58] 1 Corinthians
[25:00] 3:16 Says know you
[25:03] not that he are the temple of God and
[25:07] that the spirit of God dwelleth in
[25:09] you if any man defile the temple of God
[25:15] him shall God
[25:17] destroy for the temple of God is Holy
[25:21] which Temple ye are so now we begin to
[25:25] see in the context of the scripture
[25:27] saying
[25:28] we are fearfully and wonderfully made
[25:32] God made this body or this house or this
[25:37] Temple that he could dwell in it that
[25:40] his Spirit could work in it and through
[25:44] it we have our own Spirit we have our
[25:47] own choices I know a lot of these women
[25:51] live and and and and and wom talking
[25:54] about my choice my body and whatnot but
[25:57] is it our body or is it what God give to
[26:01] us our hands our eyes our feet our lungs
[26:08] from the crown of our head to the soul
[26:10] of our feet un loan and you hear me oft
[26:13] times the time was given to fulfill
[26:15] purpose so in this time this body called
[26:20] time the Prophet this body called time
[26:22] and time at a beginning and time of an
[26:24] ending and his body called time he give
[26:27] us this opportunity
[26:29] to fulfill his purpose so he sees our
[26:34] bodies as a temple do you see your body
[26:38] as a temple or you just doing your own
[26:41] thing 1 Corinthians
[26:43] 316 and the Amplified says do you not
[26:46] discern and understand that you the
[26:49] whole church at Corinth are God's Temple
[26:53] his sanctuary and that God's spirit has
[26:56] his permanent dwelling in you to be at
[26:58] home in you collectively as a church and
[27:02] also
[27:03] individually verse 17 Amplified if
[27:05] anyone does hurt to God's Temple or
[27:09] corrupts it with false doctrines or
[27:12] destroy it God will do hurt to him and
[27:16] bring him to the corruption of debt and
[27:18] destroy him for the temple of God is
[27:21] Holy and sacred to him and that Temple
[27:24] you the believing church and his
[27:26] individual Believers are
[27:31] so you could take
[27:33] note why I read but bram's testimony of
[27:37] when he was seven years old where God
[27:40] told him don't smoke Don't drink don't
[27:44] defile your
[27:45] body because I have a work for you to
[27:50] do at
[27:53] 87 he is not in a position to do any
[27:56] work but at 8 Heaven he could hear God's
[28:01] voice to give him an opportunity to
[28:04] prepare his mind and your mind have to
[28:07] be set in order for
[28:08] Holiness now we are not just throwing
[28:11] out words
[28:13] tonight these are very specific things
[28:16] that your mind can set it in order for
[28:21] Holiness set it in order in preparation
[28:24] to be used by God so now we find out
[28:28] that by God telling him that it means
[28:32] that God uses a certain type of
[28:36] vessel and that is why you hear me say
[28:40] God is not looking for a better sermon a
[28:42] better text a better Exposition go
[28:45] looking for a better man is you he's
[28:48] looking
[28:49] for when he got fed up with Saul he said
[28:52] I see a better man and that better man
[28:54] was David David would have his fla and
[28:57] his flaws but the fact is he saw a man
[29:00] after God's Own Heart and this is how
[29:03] you have to become you grew up from
[29:06] wherever part of train that you grew up
[29:08] from whe background or whatever and you
[29:10] have your own thoughts and ideas
[29:12] sometimes the family is lopsided
[29:14] sometime their family is not balanced
[29:15] and you out of your own family come out
[29:18] with a unbalanced view unbalanced view
[29:21] of Life unbalanced view of things around
[29:24] you and you are challenged to drop your
[29:28] view drop your thoughts and ideas and
[29:31] embrace God's thoughts as it comes
[29:33] through by the word all of us will have
[29:36] issues and challenges from our family
[29:38] background and how we grow up and what
[29:40] we see and what we taught and our
[29:42] educational background or lack there of
[29:44] whatever it might be but when it comes
[29:47] to the word IT addresses all rich poor
[29:50] Born Free poor Rich IT addresses all and
[29:55] God is no respect of persons you don't
[29:57] respect or you're rich or you have money
[29:59] Car Land house motorbike or airplane it
[30:02] doesn't M it doesn't matter what you
[30:03] have he is not respecting you by what
[30:05] you have he respects his word if you
[30:07] respect his word if you honor his word
[30:09] he will honor you after to finish this
[30:12] what I'm doing tonight let's continue 1
[30:14] Corinthians
[30:16] 6 15-
[30:18] 20 Meats for the belly and the belly for
[30:21] Meats but God shall destroy both it and
[30:25] them now the body is not for forication
[30:29] but for the Lord and the Lord for the
[30:31] but so God sees fornication certain way
[30:34] he sees sexual impurity certain way he
[30:37] see defilement a certain way and the
[30:39] scriptures Clearly say now the body
[30:42] which is your body or your house is not
[30:44] for fornication but for the Lord and the
[30:47] Lord for the body I'm still reading and
[30:49] God had both raised up the Lord and will
[30:53] also raise us by his own power knowing
[30:57] not that your bodies are the members of
[31:00] Christ shall I then take the members of
[31:03] Christ and make them the members of a
[31:05] hot God forbid what know ye not that he
[31:10] which is joined to UNH harot is one body
[31:13] for two s he shall be one flesh but he
[31:16] that is joined unto the Lord is one
[31:19] Spirit flee
[31:21] fornication every sin that a man do it
[31:23] is without the body but he that commit
[31:26] fornication sin it against his own body
[31:31] so we see from the scriptures you can
[31:33] actually sin against your own body then
[31:38] Paul in verse 19 went on further what
[31:41] know ye not that your body is the Temple
[31:43] of the Holy Ghost so I hope God will
[31:46] write this in your heart like an iron
[31:48] pen that you are your body is the Temple
[31:52] of the Holy Ghost which is in you which
[31:53] you have of God and ye and not your own
[31:58] for ye are bought with a price
[32:00] therefore glorify God in your body and
[32:05] in your spirit which are
[32:08] Gods as we hit the home stretch here now
[32:12] familiar scripture 2 Corinthians 7
[32:15] verse1 this is the
[32:19] instructions 2 Corinthians 7 vers1 says
[32:21] having therefore these
[32:23] promises dearly beloved let us cleanse
[32:28] ourselves from all filthiness of the
[32:31] Flesh and spirit perfecting Holiness in
[32:36] the fear of God shall wrap up
[32:37] here in terms of going over some so Paul
[32:43] teaching emphasizes the Holiness of the
[32:46] body and the responsibility of
[32:49] Christians to live in Purity and
[32:51] honor and church friends Christians you
[32:55] must see your body as his
[32:59] house again he said know you not that
[33:02] your body is a temple of the Holy
[33:05] Ghost he are bought with a
[33:09] price so God is calling not just to
[33:12] avoid sin but the sin especially that
[33:17] defiles the
[33:19] body If any man defile the temple of God
[33:22] him shall God destroy now Romans
[33:25] 121 Paul begging asking I beseech you
[33:29] therefore Brethren by the mercies of God
[33:32] that you present what your bodies or
[33:35] your house or your temple a Living
[33:37] Sacrifice holy acceptable unto God which
[33:42] is your reasonable service so you're
[33:45] expressing about the sanctity of the
[33:48] body your physical body so your body is
[33:52] not just a vessel of physical existence
[33:56] but it is to be a sacred place where
[33:59] God's Spirits
[34:01] dwell so this implies avoiding behaviors
[34:04] that desecrated such as sexual
[34:07] immorality substance abuse or
[34:12] neglect into this
[34:14] body we are called to maintain Purity in
[34:17] thought word and deed and therefore as a
[34:23] responsibility to glorify God as
[34:27] believers we are called to honor God
[34:29] through our action
[34:32] choices and
[34:34] lifestyle you know that's called
[34:36] diabetes two things in diabetes
[34:39] sometimes is inherited gen um genal gen
[34:44] genetically and sometimes it's
[34:47] lifestyle lifestyle could be addressed
[34:50] you cannot do anything about your genes
[34:51] pass down from Grandfather or whatever
[34:53] it is but the lifestyle you know with
[34:55] the choices you make what you eat what
[34:57] you drink where you go that is life
[35:00] C how do we address
[35:03] defilement defilement is anything that
[35:06] tarnishes a person's Purity Holiness or
[35:10] relationship with God how do we address
[35:13] that defilement can be cleansed through
[35:16] repentance and obedience to God word 1
[35:18] John 1:9 says if we confess our sins he
[35:22] is faithful and just to forgive us our
[35:24] sins and to cleanse us from all
[35:29] unrighteousness here we go the scripture
[35:32] about it read is a beautiful scripture
[35:34] I've never preached on it I always refer
[35:38] to it now and again but it's a lovely
[35:40] scripture Isaiah
[35:42] 58:12 and they that shall be of thee
[35:47] shall build the old way
[35:49] places thou shall raise up the
[35:52] foundations of many
[35:53] generations and thou sh be called the
[35:57] the repairer of the
[35:59] breach the
[36:01] restorer of paths to dwell in I just
[36:05] love the scripture the repairer of the
[36:07] breach the term breach refers to a gap
[36:11] or a broken
[36:12] Place often symbolic of broken
[36:16] relationships society that straight from
[36:18] God moral failings a repairer of the
[36:21] breach is someone who restores what is
[36:23] broken whether it's spiritual
[36:26] relationships whatever
[36:29] Believers are called to be repairers of
[36:33] the
[36:34] breach reconciling others to God 2
[36:37] Corinthians 518 said all things are of
[36:40] God who had reconciled us to himself by
[36:42] Jesus Christ and have given to us the
[36:46] ministry of reconciliation not the
[36:49] ministry of cutting off
[36:50] others no the ministry of reconciliation
[36:55] to wit that God was in Christ
[36:56] reconciling the world un himself not
[36:58] imputing their trespasses unto them and
[37:01] have committed unto us the word of
[37:04] reconciliation and then we are
[37:06] ambassadors for Christ and as though God
[37:09] did bese you by us we pray in Christ
[37:12] said be reconciled to God and this is
[37:16] what I'm trying to encourage you tonight
[37:18] to be reconciled to God regardless of
[37:21] your feelings your shortcomings your
[37:24] backslidings you have an opportunity
[37:26] tonight to be reconciled to God for he
[37:28] had made him to be sin for us who knew
[37:30] no sin that we might be made the
[37:32] righteousness of God in
[37:34] him so to be a repair of the breach is
[37:37] to be a
[37:38] restorer a
[37:40] reconciler one who addresses
[37:43] Brokenness and this is the final page
[37:46] and I'm
[37:47] done I have a caption here called
[37:50] called
[37:52] call there's one calling called call the
[37:55] children of God that Matthew 5:19
[37:57] blessed are the peacemakers for there
[38:00] shall be called the children of
[38:03] God it has called by my name 2
[38:06] Chronicles 7:14 If my people that are
[38:08] called by my name shall humble
[38:11] themselves and pray and seek my face and
[38:13] turn their Wicked Ways then will I hear
[38:16] from Heaven I will forgive their sin and
[38:18] will heal their
[38:20] lamb Rian 21:19 called The Bride the
[38:23] Lamb's wife and there came unto me one
[38:25] of the Seven Angels which had the seven
[38:27] vow follow of the seven last plagues and
[38:29] talk with me saying come hither I will
[38:31] show the the bride the Lamb's
[38:33] wine Isaiah
[38:36] 126 and I will restore thy judges as at
[38:39] the first and thy counselors as the
[38:42] beginning afterwards Thou shalt be
[38:44] called the city of
[38:46] righteousness the faithful
[38:49] City and the last one I have here is
[38:53] called the House of
[38:56] Prayer Saints we cannot continue this
[39:01] prayerlessness look how God has blessed
[39:03] us even as we short him Matthew 21:13
[39:09] and he said unto them it is written my
[39:12] house shall be called The House of
[39:16] Prayer but you have made it a den of
[39:20] things so
[39:22] friends starting tonight I hope it
[39:24] starts
[39:25] tonight that this house
[39:27] this Tabernacle this
[39:29] body could be called a House of
[39:33] Prayer you know sometimes I've heard
[39:36] testimonies of people in
[39:38] Witchcraft and how they couldn't attack
[39:41] some homes they couldn't attack some
[39:44] houses because they were always praying
[39:48] they can't attack and subvert and
[39:51] Destroy and affect a
[39:54] house in prayer

[1:31:58] read something to you but Brandon was
[1:32:00] speaking he was talking about how the
[1:32:02] devil hat his book of Revelation he
[1:32:04] knows that God cannot change do Satan
[1:32:07] knows assuredly that the original church
[1:32:08] at Pentecost the power of God s Mark 16
[1:32:12] and action is the true church that Jesus
[1:32:15] claims as his own all else is force it
[1:32:17] has to be remember this Christ in the
[1:32:21] true church is a continuation of the
[1:32:23] book of Acts but the Book of Revelation
[1:32:25] shows that the Antichrist Spirit would
