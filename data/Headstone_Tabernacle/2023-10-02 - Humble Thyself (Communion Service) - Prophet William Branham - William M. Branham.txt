God God bless you this evening as we get ready to change y to the service we'd like to put on a tape amen uh for um the title of it is humble thyself amen preached by Prophet William Mariam brandham amen so God richly bless you enter in praise God as the word goes on you may have your seats at this time you could go ahead and seat amen so just enter in and may God richly bless you this evening amen e e e e e e e e e e e e e 8 or 8:30 and uh we'll give them a pray prayer card as they come in the door however they do it and um then we'll have a prayer line and pray for the sick and you see what the holy spirit will do I believe he'll do wonders if we'll just believe him am but we got to believe him for that now with all of our heart and I think that the great hour has arrived that when God in so much as we speaking this morning has showed us so much and brought us to a certain just up to a spot just to push over that little healing that's all you need and then away it goes uh going just like it was the same thing with the discernment same thing by the prophetic to watch I stand in Calgary I beg your pardon uh it was the Queen City down in Regina Regina and er bter was standing there and a bunch of us and the Lord had told me right there the platform that'll come to pass you know the very secret of their heart and that's righty and I never thought of that in that manner I walked up the platform that night with ER and started praying for the sick and you're coming man along just laid out his entire life first time it ever happened just like that in a moment in a healing service and then I looked out over the audience and hear it begin to come down over the audience and think oh when we reach the other side the half has never yet been told of the things to watch out and see things in people's life I don't say anything about it just let it alone see unless I'm really compelled to say something and I I look for this next to start like that see God in his own way his own Sovereign time to begin it and it'll it'll be another things that will be be Way Beyond any of these other team amen and I'm looking for that to happen and maybe I thought if I had a little healing service maybe next Sunday and then the following Sunday I'll probably be away with the kids and them because they got to go back and go to school and then the next Sunday of course I'm up in Chicago at the meeting up there and then um come back to the following Monday to leave on Tuesday for for Arizona where the kids get back to school well what'd you find [Music] Pastor well I've discovered something very strange good that's very fine now we want to hear about it so now the Lord bless you all real real good and uh uh hope to see you here next Sunday and Wednesday night and listen don't forget these little churches like brother rutle brother Jackson brother porn now and all those little Brethren who are struggling hard and they feel like that we are there their their sister church here you see we're kind of like a little mother group to them that's where they were born out of here pastors and so forth this little fellow back here brother I made the other night over there Alan little brother Alan uh I hope brother Collins's here will get with brother Allan if he doesn't know him they're both me Methodist ministers and um it's seen uh truth of word which the the organization of the Methodist Church which is a fine bunch of people in that Methodist Church you never think they're not they are there's a fine bunch of people in that Catholic Church there's a fine bunch in the Presbyterian church and all those places there it's man and women that are waiting to see that light flash over their path you just keep flashing the light in humility sweetness that's all grow close to God by humbling ourselves yes don't forget this Tabernacle will lose its strength remember that this is a target where Satan's got every gun in Hell trained on he'll cause one person to do something it's contrary to watch the other things he's doing that he's up to it that's his business if he can get somebody to say something somebody to talk about another say well listen did you know so and so did don't you listen to it don't you listen to it at all that's the devil see it's Satan don't you believe it if there's anything that somebody's done wrong pray for that don't pray in a selfish way say I my I God pray for that brother you take it your heart really down for that a sister and this talk and be real sweet and the first thing you know you find him right back in the service against because after all we're headed towards the setting of the Sun the Lord Jesus will be coming one of these days and you I think you'll be so s and so so sweet so uh there'll be 100 100 of 100% of the whole world will never know when that Rapture take place it'll just go so quietly that nobody know nothing about see and it'll be of course the little groups will say oh no so and so all they say it's fanatic mnch over there said a group left from over there and they that's not so they just gone out somewhere we've had that fanaticism see um while they say that little Tabernacle in a place called Jeffersonville there was so many of them members that's missing see they just play that up they say oh there's nothing to that to see like that it'll be passed and they won't know it across the nation will come those who are dead in Christ will rise first the Rapture will take place the church will be taken home and then the tribulation will set in and oh my we don't want to be here during that time I don't want to be here in the tribulation you know God forbid that any of us can ever be here during that time because he that's filthy is filthy still he that's holy is Holy still he that's righteous is righteous still there's no the lamb has come forth with his book of redemption and the bride has been taken out those who turned it down has to go through a tribulation period both Jew and Gentile what a time of tribulation I don't want that Lord sanctify me now that's good nazarine Doctrine in amen and and it's truth too it's truth that's right amen fill me now with your Holy Spirit Lord take all the world out of me now Lord don't is the old color brother said so I got my ticket in my hand it's already punched and when I come down the river that morning I don't want no trouble so that's about right I I don't want no trouble hold your ticket in your hand because we're going over just think of it the great time of redemption is at hand amen and now another thing brother uh what's his name up here at UD I think brother grim and another brother there that's pastoring there brother what Shanks or something like that brother s a pastor all together brother Snelling a pastor up at UD now I think their prayer meeting is on Thursday night Thursday night how you know it would be real night if we would slip up there on Thursday night and show those fellas a little Fellowship see and then when brother Jackson the times that he has his if we just do a little grbs together and go just keep praying keep digging don't stop just like when Elijah told him said dig ditches out there when you get down you hit an old Tim can and say I'm too tired throw it out the way and keep digging let's keep digging cuz we got to dig we just got the Dig that's all because if you if you expect to miss the tribulation you better start diing and now for myself I'm preaching to myself there I'm going to start digging deeper than I ever go because I feel like that in the nation and around the world that this ministry will again as it's known now about everywhere over the world I I must go again wife said to me other morning I said I w't you to go with me when I leave I'm going to leave around January PR the Lord Willl I want to take a complete World Tour all the way around amen come back and maybe have services in United States sometime next summer and she said I'm too old to go well I said I went when I about my last trip overseas is about 8 years ago and I feel like I'm in better shape now it was 8 years ago I know more about it now then we got on the subject if the Lord said I'm going to lot you 25 years you're not going to get feeble you be able to go and I'm going L you 25 years on Earth would you take from from birth to 25 or from 25 to 50 50 to 75 or 75 to 100 now any man is lot at any time on Earth will certainly do a most racial thing if you don't spend that time in service of God I don't care what he does if you're going to be a heartbreak for the women or so for you better take that young age that first 25 if you're going to be a carpenter a mechanic or something you better take the second 25 see but I was thinking about what about me what would I take I'd take from 75 to 100 I'd be smarter wiser i' be more settled I know more about what I'm doing I'm 10 eight or 10 years old than the last time I was overseas I won't jump in like I'm killing snakes I know more about it I know how is it like a dog fighting Theon see you know about how to take a hold of you don't jump in there scratch you up see know his tricks and watching what he does and we learn more about the enemy so we've got to find out all his techniqus and how he approaches and what he does learn these punches then you're trained to going on you see so I believe now I told wife I believe I'm better shape now once when it's 40 years old one over I'm 54 now I believe if I live and can still get around as good as can I I'm 100 if I Jesus would carry that long I'd be in better shape than I am now to go because you know more about it you know more about what to do and how to handle it how to handle the situation amen take a lot of people out if you're going to get operated on say say a new doctor just graduated the other day just come out of medical school you never had an operation yet let him do it oh no you say nothing do it not that guy no sir yet I don't want him putting on KNE on me I better to go down here and get so and so I know he's had a lot of operations he knows how to do it that's that's you think think about this but what about that soul I want somebody who knows where they're at who knows the road who's traveling yes indeed Lord bless you all right brother n get up here now and God bless brother n don't forget now next time I was just uh had a surprise in my heart for the thing because in myself I had recognized I esteemed the ministry of my many brethren outside of there before brother brandham come I said I don't know is he'll Minister tonight I was talking to Dr Le Veo here and I said I was in the meeting at Middletown Ohio and you were the one that talked through the day and I said I deeply appreciated the meeting along with the teaching that brother Vale did over there in conjunction with the meeting at Middletown yes and I said I esteem the Servants of God and uh one of us I said whoever preaches it always does the other one good because the ministry is all inspired by the same spirit amen and uh there isn't any any selfishness or ambitiousness in me and I Delight to welcome the Ministers of God especially who are cooperating together with this and in it together with us I Delight to hear from them amen so I asked Dr Lee Bale I said would you Minister if brother brandham doesn't brother Brandon didn't he might have known this didn't say anything about so I asked brother Vale tonight if he would Minister for us in case that brother brandham didn't because he associated with him in the meetings and he knows about the way this way and we're glad to have brother veale I appreciate him and respect him as well as to do any of the other ministers and like I do all the others and so if he will come tonight and speak for us I'd be delighted to have him to do it God bless and let's pray for brother Vil some of you have never heard him and I trust that you pray for him I apologize to the audience I didn't know sit there did this is fixed up God bless you brother D it wasn't fixed up he said come good that's fine I'll get he myself brother B spoke of Any Time ahead of in the meetings and and so forth he managed the meetings for a long time and was fine Brother done a swell job and I'm sure this audience is always glad to hear Brother B when he speak Lord bless [Music] brother so much was said uh I couldn't say nothing to make it any better and I truly believe that it was the Lord that worked us out for brother Veil to bring this man amen after this morning yes so do I you see it has to work that way we we accept that from God yes well there's so many things he was saying I I I have 20 sermons go down here off what he said I was thinking here of one little illustration to back up what he said now we look at this watch to find out what time it is unless that every instrument in that watch is coordinating one with the other will never know the correct time amen is that right and that takes all of us all together if we want to see the third pool really do something for God it's coordination with every one of us together to Humble ourselves before God and confess our wrongs and pray and believe God for these things I truly believe that what brother B said is the truth that God will never put his spirit in Unholy unrighteous disobedient Temple it's got to come in the The Way of the cleansing of our heart from all G and iniquity that we might be pure before God that he might work his pure Holy Spirit through us to bring these things to pass I I think that when you go home tonight if you would read that little book of Jude you just learn a whole lot now of what brother Bale has said and he said and I earnestly contend for the faith that was once delivered to the Saints they got away from it how a man of corrupt mind and so forth had come in and beguile him away from the from the real things of God and God can only operate as we let him operate and so many wonderful things about saying you know people want power and really they don't know what power is amen they don't really know what what what goes with it the the Way Up Is Down always you if you want Power see how humble you can get just get away from all your worri thinking and humble yourself before God and then you got more power than the man that runs all over the building and makes a big lot of noise because you have been able to conquer yourself and commit yourself to Christ to humble yourself before him that's really powerful you show me a church that's humble real humble not a a irant a church just a sweet Humble Church I'll show you a church that has a favor and power of God Amen that's the thing it takes hum humility humbling ourselves before God letting God just work to us you don't have to make a lot of noise uh sometimes as the farmer said he went out to the field with his wagon and every time he hit a bump it just rattled and went on but when he come back he hit the same bump didn't make no noise at all because it loaded with good things so I think that's about right that we get filled up with the good things of God that the fruit of the spirit might be known through us as he referred so much to First Corinthians 13 there how that though I give my body be burnt and have all these things and have not charity it's nothing prophets mean nothing you see we want to do that above all things it's our individual Souls that we're responsible before God see it's it's you going to heaven it isn't whether I go or he goes It's You Going see it you first and you've got to look this out and come sweet before the Lord and I've always found out that the man that humbles himself is the man that God exalts when you take a person with his chest out knows everything and you can't tell him nothing and he's arrogant and well that that's a person that never gets anywhere but you take that person that humbles themselves and walks sweetly I was talking to a man dur a DAT it's just organizing a church up at the uh uh pulled out of an organization that had been what brother Bose and then Church where they they had that great church there for so long and the Lord is Blessing and the people got to a place that they want to polish up like the rest them and want to throw it into an organization and when they did it just those humble Christians in there did not want that all their life have been taught against it so they walked away from it now they've got a group and the Lord has blessed them until they're coming in up into a big place now again bought a church now that puts up about 4 5,000 people and they're starting over and they come to me and said brother brand sitting right there in in the office of the church office the other day and he said one of the leaders brother the CL them said what must we do I said find a man to be the Shepherd that has no reputation all denomination just a real good janeline sweet humble brother that lives a life God will take care of the rest of him I said a good pastor that feed the sheep and be humble and than God will do the rest if you not some big know it all is coming he's going to put this in order and this has to be this way cutting things around I said it'll never work you just got through it that's it every piece in the church must work together and you must keep up your part of it so we can see what time we're living in we may be closer than we think we are now we appreciate by the veil don't we the Lord bless you by the veil thank you and we thank the Lord for bringing this great message to us tonight and got a note a few minutes ago one of the sisters had had something she wanted to tell in a dream if you just write it out tell me sister they give her some dreams that has been absolutely true we don't accept all dreams no no but when they're of God we want to know it it's God talking to it like everything speaks the tongues we don't believe it but when there's an interpretation comes that tells us something that's going to happen we see it happen and we thank the Lord for it see we want to keep it running smoothly sweetly and in order uh of the Lord so just remember that your part may be the main spring of it may be the little uh some little hand or some little part of the winding stem whatever it may be or it may be the hands on the face the clock it tells the time but whatever it is it takes us all working together in harmony with the Gospel of Jesus Christ to bring this to P just think if gifts is so great what we call power and Paul said though I have faith that I can move them and have not charity I am nothing amen amen think that and though you say well though I understand I wish TR know the Bible though I understand all the mysteries of God see and still go on good do it and have not charity I I'm know see I haven't got no wor yet see the main thing is love God and humble yourself with it I surely uh after all these years on the field and around the world and seeing different people I Al know a little bit about the gate to enter in at and if you want to get somewhere with God never let a irran spirit ever come around don't let No Malice come in no matter what anybody's done if they are wrong don't you never build up a complex against that person you'd be sweet and kind remember God loved you when you were in sin and if the spirit of God's in you you love the other person when he's in love just pray for them and love one another above everything love God and love one another and be humble with God and around one another and God will bless us and hard down what he will do usually when Church begins to get numbers and get to getting a little bigger or something like that then they get away from that real thing the real thing you know what brought these things to pass when I first started the Lord appeared to me down the river and told me that brother B saw that I believe in the paper in Canada many years ago where that angel of the Lord appeared on the river down there is on Associated Press Mystic light over a local Minister wild bapti and and you know what I did that when we had the tent meeting just across the street a tent that seated about or 2 200 people ministers come from Able work said brother come here minute not just a boy but or just a kid and he said how do you keep those people in one Accord they love one another till they I never seen people love one another That's the Law that's what this church was established upon on that Godly brotherly love for one another I've SE them even shake hands to one another leave in the place and cry like babies to leave one another they love one another that well and I could go to their house to Vis them and times the Bible was laying open and stain with tears coming at night time where fathers and mothers was gathered together and there little children around on the floor kneeling around and fathers and mothers on their knees crying and praying and I'd stand at the door and wait and wait and wait and they did stop praying I just sat down on my steps and start praying myself wait for see and that that was what and they love one another they love one another we used to stand and sing that old song blessed be the ti that binds our hearts in Christian love a fellowship of kindered mind is like to that above when we areer part it gives us inward pain but we shall still be jwn in heart and hope to meet again I say this with great joy in my heart to Christ many of them are sleeping around in these Graves mark and I waiting for that great Resurrection where we'll meet together again let not that Spirit ever depart from this place if it ever does then I don't care how eloquent your pastor might be how well he might bring the word of God the spirit of God is grieved away and we can have all things and fellowship in common love one another then God will work with us and we're keeping time that the people come by and say if you want to see a church that's really humble a church that really loves God droping up at that Tabernacle one time and watch them look at the care they have for one another the respect when the gospel is being preached how reverence how everything just in order that's then they can look and see what time we're living you'll see the spirit of God moving among you great signs and wonders and things will be taking place if the things working together it's telling the time but if it isn't working then time is stopped it won't tell the time no more so if we want to know what time we're living just start everybody working together in the gospel loving one another loving God and the hands itself will tell the time what we amen do you believe that amen amen the Lord bless your real richly don't forget now get around this week and if you know any of the sick people that's coming in tell them when he come say dear I uh I want to ask you we're having uh prayer for the sick Sunday morning over the Tabernacle and um uh you've been sick for a while now one well I want to go I've always want to go now I just heard a message Sunday night from a brother there that how we must confess our faults one to another and pray one for another that we might be heal James 5:14 131 14:15 that we must confess our faults one to another before we even come for healing confess our fults one to another and pray one for the other see see that this is exactly what he's talking about tonight brings back the Beatitudes in with Mark 16 BR that together you've got it then healing take place look at Jesus nothing but one bundle of Love see he was God manifested he God expressed himself through him no wonder Miracles and things happen his humble life and consecrated life to come from to from being God to be a man here on Earth to express God to himself that's what made him what he was I've always said what made Jesus God to me was the way he humbled himself he was so great and yet be so small that's right the Lord bless you real good now let's stand up and for the dis amen let's all stand glory to God hallelujah thank you Jesus let's just give him praise now oh Father we thank you we praise you we glorify your holy name oh Hallelujah glory to God I want to live the way Jes Jesus wants me to live I want to give until there's just no more to give I want to love love till there's just no more Lord what I could never never out love the Lord one more time with all your heart I want to live oh the way that Jesus wants me to live I want to give until there's just no more to give I want to love oh love till there's just no more love and I could never never I love my Lord oh give him praise right now in your own [Music] way Hallelujah give him praise lift your hands oh Hallelujah I want to live

time I want to live oh I want to live the Jesus wants me to live I want to give until there's just no more give I want to love love till there just no more love I can never really out love the Lord amen and amen if you have your Bibles like to turn to 1 Corinthians chapter 11 reading from verse 23 for I've received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you that the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread and when he had given thanks he break it and said take eat this is my budy which is broken for you this do in remembrance of me and after the same manner also he took the cup when he had stopped saying this cup is the New Testament in my blood this do ye as offer he drink it in remembrance of me for as often as he eat this bread and drink this cup you do show the Lord's dead till he come wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord but let a man examine himself and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup for he that eat it and drink it unworthily eat it and drink a damnation to himself not Discerning the Lord's body for this cause many are weak and sickly among you and many sleep for if we would judge ourselves we should not be judged but when we are judged we are chastened of the Lord that we should not be condemned with the world let's bow our heads almighty God we thank you for being here this evening we thank you for the articles of the bread and wine and we pray a blessing upon it as your people participate Lord may bring healing strength and make bring that anointing of obedience to your word and to your will to follow through to obey this till you come bless them Lord as we wait upon you in Jesus I ask it amen and am let's bow our heads and close our eyes as we just want to reflect on our lives just for a minutes in prayer and you pray for the ministry Min pray for you praise the Lord amen you may be seated as we [Music] continue [Music]
