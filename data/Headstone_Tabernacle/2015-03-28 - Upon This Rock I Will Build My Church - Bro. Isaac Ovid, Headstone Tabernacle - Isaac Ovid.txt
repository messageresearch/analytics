brother jerome from mother pop well amen uh he's down with the virus and i know a few people are suffering um i know the enemy was mad with sunday service and he was mad with wednesday's service in diego martin and he was mad with fizzy service right here this week i myself was battling a bit of a sore throat and i'm kind of suffering a bit with my throat but the devil is a liar i said the devil is picking the wrong fight fighting the wrong people at the wrong time because the church is coming into power you don't mess with the church when the church is coming into power we pray for the sick and the sick is recovering the sick is being healed and the devil doesn't like that he don't want us to pray for the sick he don't want us to cast out devils but that's what the church is supposed to do so i stand my ground tonight and if the devil wants to punch we're going to punch right back but the random taught us when the devil said boo we're gonna say boo right back so i'm depending on god tonight to use my vocal chords to use this body tonight because i have no strength of my own and for everyone that may be sick or down here on the internet god is still a healer he is still the same yesterday today and forever there is no doubt in my mind take that devil we are going victorious we are gonna be victorious so shall we bow our heads in a word of prayer our gracious heavenly father lord healing is a children's bread lord we already see signs lord of your people being touched being healed being delivered being set free lord god as we wait on you and wait on that angel to move to

this tape bother me you touch them also may your healing rain pour out father may you bring great deliverance and restoration to your people today lord we ask in the precious name of jesus christ and the church says amen we want to welcome uh sharian george and greville constantine i believe it is invited by brother granville welcome to the headstone tabernacle we're happy to have you here with us amen i'd like to also welcome ronald griffith elizabeth griffith and antonella griffith invited my brother batiste welcome to the headstone tabernacle we're happy to have you here with us as well so you love the law this evening hey man i'd like to go straight to the world i'd like to welcome everyone in the precious name of jesus to our special two services today at five and tomorrow uh 5 p.m service there will be no 10 a.m service tomorrow so we are on a great expectation for what god will do today and tomorrow amen amen reading one portion of scripture today we want to read from the book of saint matthew chapter 16 and we want to read uh from verse 13. amen matthew 16 and verse 13. when jesus came into the coast of caesarea philadelphia he asked his disciples saying whom do men say that i the son of man am and they said some say that thou art john the baptist some elias and others jeremiah's or one of the prophets you see it unto them but whom say ye that i am and simon peter answered and said thou art the christ the son of the living god and jesus answered and said unto him blessed are thou simon by jonah for flesh and blood had not revealed it unto thee but my father which is in heaven and i say also unto thee that peter and upon this rock i will build my church and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it and i will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven then charge his disciples that they should tell no man that he was jesus the christ and from that time fort began jesus show unto his disciples how that he must go into jerusalem and suffer many things of the elders and chiefs priests and scribes and be killed and be raised again the third day then peter took him and began to rebuke him saying be it far from thee lord this shalt not be unto thee but he turned and said unto peter get thee behind me satan thou art an offense unto me for those savories not the things that be of god but those that be of men then jesus and uh then jesus unto his then said jesus unto his disciples if any man shall come after me let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me for whosoever shall save his life shall lose it and whosoever shall lose his life for my sake shall find it for what is a man profited if he shall gain the whole world and lose his own soul or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul may the lord have a blessing to the reading of his word shall we pray gracious heavenly father we thank you for your love for your grace for your mercy lord that you extended to us today to be gathered lord once more in your presence lord any man can read the scripture but it takes the holy spirit to breathe life upon it father may you speak to your children here today father may you take me out of the way and bring great deliverance to the captives father god may you bring restoration to your people lord a time of lord god or refreshing for the church oh god as we approach this season of easter follow me you be with us me you anoint my vocal cords may you annoy my body may you take away all the discomfort father and lord may you speak lip the air to your children today in the precious name of jesus christ and the church says amen you may be seated amen so we are gathered in the presence of the lord this evening under great expectation for what god will do this evening and in the message expectations brother branham said what we need is back to the bible back to real holiness back to god back to where people can have faith amen and in the message jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever he said we're living in the end time and i believe it's time for the restoration of the church that was promised that god would send in the last days and i believe this is the day that when the world has been preached so much and the day is getting so dark and so evil till according to god's word he was to restore all that the caterpillar had eaten the palmer worm had eaten will be restored back again but the branham said in the restoration of the brine tree now that's the tree that joel spoke about it cannot die the worms eat it down but it couldn't die because in its root it had the predestinated truth which is god's word can the church say amen joel saw every one of them eat down to the bottom but he said i will restore saith the lord for the predestination of god lays in the roots of the tree it's got to come forth because it's holding the predestinated word of god can the church say amen so what are we seeing this evening there's a predestinated seed inside of your soul you can't even avoid it if you wanted to you couldn't even miss this service if you wanted to because god promised to restore god promised to build god promised to restore his church can the church say amen so i have a title this evening and my title is taken from matthew 16 upon this rock i will build my church and my subject who do you say that i am and an inspiration despite the revelation a supernatural element still remains can the church say amen let me say that one more time for my title upon this rock i will build my church and for a subject who do you who do you say that i am and for an inspiration despite the revelation a supernatural element still remains so today we find ourselves focused on matthew 16. and every scripture has its place every scripture is important it's very difficult to place great importance and one scripture and great importance in another scripture because every scripture has its place but as we approached palm sunday and good friday and isa sunday i felt compelled to kind of focus on matthew 16 tonight but before we could really appreciate matthew 16 i want to briefly consider what happened before matthew 16 because what happened before matthew 16 and what happened after matthew 16 is what makes matthew 16 so important in the book of matthew it's the first book in the new testament it's the first of the four gospels and in matthew chapter one and two it focuses on the birth of the christ in matthew 3 we are introduced to john the baptist and we see jesus baptized in matthew 4 jesus is led into the wilderness to be tempted and tested and he overcomes by the word it is written it is written it is written and after jesus overcomes he goes into the temple to identify his ministry the spirit of the lord is upon me for he had anointed me to preach and and bring the good news and to break down the panzer to lose the change he was letting everybody know what his ministry was but they still did not even realize who he was and they asked the question is this not joseph's son he didn't realize who he was isn't that right from matthew 5 6 and 7 jesus is just preaching he's just teaching he's he's a good teacher he's he's bringing things to the people that they could hold on to he's bringing hope and possibility and a renewal they have never heard good news like this news before for years the children of israel had went from one conqueror to the next from the greeks of the persians to the persians to the syrians at this one and they were finally on the oppression of the romans and here was somebody who was bringing good news to them and they were happy because jesus was in town we are building to something in matthew 8 jesus heals a leper and a centurion walks up to jesus and and says listen just speak the word and my servant will be healed in matthew 8 jesus calms the storm and he casts demons into swine and people start to get upset with jesus because it's all right to say good things but when you begin to change how we do things and how we are used to doing it then it becomes a a disruptive force in matthew chapter 9 we find jesus preaching normal service but four believers open up the roof while jesus is preaching jesus is getting along to a good point and four believers decide to climb up the side of the church open up the roof and drop their friend inside because there was no room to get into this and jesus confronted with this situation says thy sin be forgiven these and and the scribes and the pharisees and the critics and everybody else who is around they're like how could you forgive sin and he says which is easier to forgive sins or heal this man and he tells a man to pick up your bed and walk can the church say amen we're building to something in matthew 9 that same chapter there comes a woman to jesus with an issue of blood spent all that she had went to every doctor went to every specialist went to every advisor and could find no solution to the problem that she faced and something taller if i could just get to jesus if i could just get to jesus and maybe there's somebody here tonight with that same prayer on the inside because you didn't come to hear me preach tonight you came to just get to jesus the situation that you came in here with you have carried for a long time like that woman she was bleeding for so long that she felt weak she felt tired she had no more money she had no more strength but she said to herself if i could just get to jesus i don't know really who he is whatever just get to jesus i'm not sure what he is saying but if i could just get to jesus i don't have all the answers but if i could just get to jesus if i could just touch the hem of his garment i'll be made whole you may be seated and she had to press away she had to fight away she had to because there were people around jesus and and at this time up to this moment it is so important because jesus still has not told anybody who he was understand this israel had always been used to prophets it was not to use the word common but they were used to having prophets so it was easy for them to say this jesus is just like another prophet but this woman she began to press away and as she touched the hem of his garment jesus asked the question who touched the disciples around jesus at this point in time they had been with jesus for some time so they kind of know oh jesus they say but jesus how could you ask who touch you when everybody's around he said this is different this person made a withdrawal from the heavenly bank account i felt virtue left me i felt power left me i felt grace left me i felt healing rain left me she signed a check there are blank checks hanging over and somebody gonna put their request on the check and she put a request on the check can the church say amen that's matthew 9. in matthew 10 jesus begins to focus a bit more on his disciples and focuses on instruction and training for these 12 men because there's a responsibility ahead there's a work ahead it's a challenge ahead and unless there is training you cannot confront what lies ahead it is impossible to deal with the challenges of anything unless you are trained and prepared for it you cannot say i want to be a firefighter and when there's a fire you just run inside the fire there is there has to be training so you know the right approach where to put your foot what signs to look for so that you could do the job and so too jesus had to invest time and effort and energy to explain to his disciples what they were about we still haven't reached matthew 16 yet in matthew 11 john the baptist is locked in prison and sends his disciples to ask jesus a question a very important question a question john has been wondering about for some time now when he says he said we say go ask that teacher that preacher that man over there who's doing all go ask him are you the one or should we look for another one and jesus still doesn't answer the question he said tell john tell john tell john the sick of being healed tell john the blind is seen tell john the lame is walking tell john the dead is coming alive tell john there's a revival among the people of god tell john there's a liberty in the house of god tell tonder young people are on fire tell john the sinner is coming back to court tell john those who haven't been in church for a long time finding new joy new peace new victory new satisfaction tell john you may be seated in other words jesus was saying john's supposed to know what that means i'm not ready to tell anybody who i am just yet but tell john because my works are supposed to speak of me the things that i do are supposed to speak of me and the same works that i do you are going to do also i don't hear you deceiving them i don't hear you this evening that's only 40 percent but tell john can the church say amen you may be seated are you the one or should we look for another john had trained his people that we ought to be looking for somebody that there's somebody who's gonna come and the captives are gonna go free when this man comes the sick will not stay sick when this man come the sinner no matter what condition there was one woman who was so black on earth in her condition with how much men she was living with but when she met jesus jesus took and he raised up and erased her past erased what the world set up out of erase it didn't matter what the history book said about him when jesus takes the eraser of the blood up and he puts it on you what you did yesterday what you did five years ago i don't care how bad it was he is still the same of yesterday today and forever hallelujah you may be seated what are you preaching about preacher i'm preaching about jesus that's what this is about it's always about jesus if you can't preach about jesus we can't have church what kind of church is this this is the jesus church can the church help me because he's the same yesterday he's the same today he's the same forever hallelujah you may be seated the deep question today is do you know him do you know this jesus i know you heard about him i know you heard messages about him but do you know jesus have you shook his hand have you touched his clothes have you ate with him have you fellowship with him well today god wants a personal relationship with you can the church say man hallelujah hallelujah i'm starting to feel better i told my wife at home i said when the anointing touches me i'll be all right she said you want to take this medication i say nah i'll take this one i'll take that one i'll say but when the anointing gets ahold of me just let me get to church i'll be all right just let me get in the present i'll be all right i took all kinds of stuff this morning but just let me get into the presence of the shekinah glory then all the bad feeling got a cold all the sword showed that to go because he is still jesus christ the same yesterday the same today the same forever can the church say amen hallelujah glory to god you could be healed today you could be healed today you could be delivered today you could be set free i don't care this is the first time you were in church in 10 years today is your day to get a revival to get your personal experience all hell is against you all hell try to stop you the devil try to stop you from being here today but too late devil too late you made it to the upper room you made it to the presence of god you made it to the shekinah glory and he who started to work in you is more than able to finish it up he is a finisher he is the author he is the finisher he is our he is omega he is the beginning he is the ender he is the person he is the last son he is jehovah tyrell he is jehovah's psalm hallelujah hallelujah glory to god somebody give praise to god he inhabits the praises of his people maybe you don't understand why we make so much noise but when you come into contact with god you can't help but make noise you can't help but worship because he did it for me i didn't do it for myself i couldn't save myself he saved me he picked me out of the mary clay what do you think about jesus he's all right what you think about jesus oh don't tell me that my lord is dead he woke me up this morning don't tell me hallelujah hallelujah oh i feel good i feel religious i feel like this your old time kind of church hallelujah you may be seated i got so much toffee i don't know where to go but somebody's already pulling because it's it really came upon me how many people sit in the message they know the message but they don't know jesus that's the whole problem they know the message but they don't know jesus the message is about jesus that's why brother branham could say you don't need to know the mechanics but just know the dynamics brother said he is the dynamics he said point to jesus it's all about jesus it's not about me it's not about you it's about him it's about him it's about him it's about him it's about him it's not your sadness it's about him it's not your frustration it's about him it's not how you feel it's about him hallelujah you may be seeing it you don't pull me off my notes already hallelujah we're trying to get to matthew 16. we just reached matthew 12 now in matthew 12 the scribes and the pharisees decide to pick a fight with jesus so it should be no surprise when you start to stand firmly in the wood when people start to say well why are you doing so and why are you doing this and you know it's a paradox the scribes and the fairies weren't worldly people no they were the religious people the people who had the scriptures and they had the books and they have the tapes and they have the records but they decide to pick a fight with jesus matthew 12. in matthew 13 jesus begins to speak about the kingdom of heaven and he gives a number of parables he speaks of the parable of the sower goes forth to sow and he talks about that entire parable he speaks about a treasure buried in the field the pearl of great prices picks up the net thrown out into the sea that pulls all kinds of different people jesus is trying to bring such clarity to the minds of the people that they understand the message that he is bringing to them moves on to matthew 14 where john the baptist is killed and jesus continues to heal in that chapter jesus walks in the water peter also walks underwater this man called peter this morning i told my wife i said peter was really a character peter was we're going to talk a bit about peter but peter was special then in matthew 15 we find a woman says to jesus jesus my daughter is that with the devil she has problems with the devil and jesus says well it's not fit to take the children's bread and cast it to dogs and she quickly put that statement on facebook hashtag what jesus said but it takes a special understanding of jesus for you to see through his eyes and for that brief moment when she heard that statement she saw something few people would see and she said the right thing because she understood that jesus was testing so when jesus said it's not fit to take the children's bread and cast it to dogs she said but even the dogs get some kind of crumbs from off the masters table isn't there a crumb for me jesus didn't even say your daughter is healed he said quote woman coke woman call that away you're good you're good you're good because she said the right thing god give us some christians who could say the right thing you may be seated now we come to our text this evening do you have time this evening because i'm i'm healing them we can go for five hours today this is this is getting good it's like ice cream we totally peel on it coming in nice right now can the church say amen so we come to our text matthew 16 our area of focus we will spend the rest of the service stuck in this chapter this scripture represents a turning point in jesus's ministry for some reason jesus decides to take his disciples to file a pie which is not even part of the israel or judea or whatever name you want to call this is gentile territory in other words he takes them aside away from prying eyes away from everybody else he breaks the routine he breaks the tradition he does something different like have a saturday 5 pm see obviously there's something a little out of the ordinary a little a little out of the ordinary oh yeah in that very chapter it started with him having an argument with the pharisees because the pharisees are saying this jesus healing with power from the devil and and in that scene matthew 16 jesus reminds his disciples of how he fed the five thousand and then he comes down to the meat of the taxidermy he asks a very important question who do men say that i am amen and this is a question almost like an icebreaker if they could use it it's really a conversation started because this is not really the question he wants to get to he is starting a conversation to get a specific point so he said who do men say that i am and the bible says that some say you are john the baptist some elias some jeremiah so one of the prophets and it's easy for us to talk about what men say about him and many people in the church could only say what men said about him many young people could only say what the preacher said about him what their parents said about him because quite frankly they don't know him so jesus brought the question and it's so deep in and of itself because by this time jesus had already been rejected by the people people loved him but he didn't worship him they didn't know who he was he never made clear who he was and when he asked who do men say i am his disciples picked the very best answers they could come up with at least they knew he wasn't bad so they picked good names john the baptist he liars jerry myers you have to be uh one of the prophets and then he asked the question we really want to come to today who do you say that i am and if you read this original not in the english but in original greek this who do you say it's not just you as in you that you had a certain inflection on the word that went like who do you who are with me who do you who have been with me since matthew 4 5 6 7 8 who do you who have seen what i've done who do you who have heard me preach who do you who have seen all these signs wonders say that i am but this question was not just a question because jesus was at a crossroad in his ministry jesus could not go on until this issue was dealt with so jesus called a halt in matthew 16 to his ministry to confront his disciples he could not go on until he revealed certain things to his disciples but before he could reveal it to his disciples they had to really understand who he was and that's how so many of us find ourselves on our christian journey we don't even realize that before we can even go forward we have to come to our face off with who he really is who you really are who the enemy really is jesus knew that matthew 24 was coming jesus knew that breathing upon them as he received you the holy ghost was coming but you can't reach matthew 24 until you get through matthew 16. you can address the power coming into the church unless you deal with matthew 16. you cannot have a manifestation of the sons of god until you deal with matthew 16. can the church say amen amen and peter says thou are the christ the son of the living god amen and jesus answered and said unto him blessed are those simon barjona for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee but my father which is in heaven peter was convinced that that was the messiah it didn't make a difference what anybody else says it didn't make a difference with the priesthood he had a revelation from god and if you ever get a revelation from god it separates you from everybody else because god has spoken to you and if you have a revelation it doesn't matter who does what you heard from god can the church say amen brother branham and speaking about revelation he says the church is built on spiritual revelation we know that right and he made a type with the first display of breaking out a revelation with cain and abel and in question and answers he said cain was a believer think about it keane was a believer he went to god he built an altar he done every religious thing that abel done but he didn't have the spiritual revelation of the will of god amen he didn't have the spiritual revelation and that's the matter with the church today and jesus said he will build his church on that spiritual revelation hallelujah the church say amen cain come he built an altar he worship he brought sacrifice he knelt down he praised god he worshipped god he done everything religious like abel and god refused him because he didn't have a spiritual revelation friend somebody could invite you to church you could be in church for 10 years and not have a revelation amen there are people in church for 20 years and they don't have a revelation god has not spoken to them just like the disciples before matthew 16 they were just following without revelation because from matthew to 16 nobody had a revelation can the church say amen but abandonment said follow the same line of cane right down to the ark from the ark right up to israel from israel right on into jesus and from jesus right on till this day and see if that carnal fundamental church stiff and starch scholarly i mean men who have the scriptures who know all the doctrine and the theologies they could explain it like that by the random said but without spiritual revelation he said that's the doctrine of cain can the church say amen but in christ is the mystery of god with you but but the bible said god is known by simplicity and of revelation of jesus christ to the most illiterate person in other words you don't need to be a theologian to understand jesus to the most illiterate person god could reveal himself to you not your theology is the revelation of jesus christ and upon this rock i'll build my church can the church say amen no other rocks accepted no other things accepted no other roman rock no other protestant rock no other school no other nothing but on exactly the revelation of jesus christ through the new boot he born in there and he injects his own life is there anybody want that new pert and an injection of his own life and your life is gone it's no more no more your life but it's his life somebody say man and the life of christ is projecting itself through you with the preeminences to the people that they see the very life and the works and signs and wonders that he did and is doing the same thing through you outside of that the rest of it is not even called it and it's a lack of this revelation is why we have so many divisions can the church say amen so friends there's no school there's no theologian there's no teaching of the bible that can give you revelation revelation is between you and god it's a personal individual affair with the person of christ that's revealed to you and revelation is sovereign god only to ask permission to give you a revelation god can speak to you right now and give you a revelation that you are a child of the king and you are born for a purpose and your past is over can the church see amen and you are going to get the holy ghost and you are going to get adopted and you're going to be perfected and you're going to have a living faith a living virtue a living knowledge a living temperance god delivered a revelation today that your child no matter what he's doing can be delivered can be delivered your husband your wife whatever it is he is still god tonight and jesus said to peter that thou art peter and upon this rock i will build my church and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it matthew 16 is so important because in the four gospels matthew mark luke and john jesus only uses the word church in two chapters he doesn't use the word church in mark he doesn't use the word church and luke he doesn't use the word church in john he only uses the word church in the book of matthew and in chapter 16 and then chapter 18. so this passage of text is the first time that jesus introduces the word church he said upon this rock i will build my church he's not talking about a physical church he's not talking about this church and that church and this group and that group he's from his church where he is the head of the church and by one spirit we are baptized into the party you see upon this revelation i will kill my church and the case of hell will not prevail against it can the church say amen god always wanted to build this church because the devil came and destroyed god's first church god had a church in the garden of eden adam and eve was a church and the devil came and break down that church and jesus came to build his church but to build anything you have to have a foundation and jesus said the foundation of this church is spiritual revelation the revelation of jesus christ revelation in the church that he's the same yesterday today and forever in the message ephesian church is whether branham said we want to be right oh my it's a serious thing brother we have got to get this thing right we'll never be able to have a church until god gets a foundation to lay it on he will never build his church upon a bunch of nonsense he has to come on his word or he won't come at all right on his word is that why we have to fight for a clean church a holy church a sanctified church a church in order on god's word not on our idea or interpretation of how it should be somebody's saying man sometime i asked a question the prophet would stand in the pulpit and some of us act the way we act what would he say because they hated the prophet when he was blasting all the bull heads and the styles and the fashions they hated it everybody loves the times and the wonders but they don't like to be straightened up but he has to come on his word and the word itself is a revelation can the church say amen hallelujah but the brandon said i know you think i'm crazy but if i am let me alone i'm happy this way i feel better this way than i did the other way when i had my right mind i don't think you heard me but he ran him in a wedding scepter in in the messenger wedding supper he said the holy ghost that was in christ comes into the believer that's got an invitation to the supper and he's counted her son because he becomes a part of the father he says i know you think i'm crazy but if i am let me alone i'm happy this way i feel better this way than i did the other way when i had my right mind oh it's wonderful it's joy unspeakable and full of glory i tell you if you are a christian and you don't have joy there's something wrong with your testimony if you tell me you're a christian and you can't smile there's something wrong with your testimony because no matter how bad things get you could just pull a scripture all things work together for good weeping may endure for night you have so many scriptures so many quotes so many you wanna why you gotta walk around depressed frustrate him i don't know what's going on the devil trying to get you the devil is supposed to try to get you that's why the bible says put on the full armor of god so you could withstand this is not a game this is warf here can the church see man there's a time for war there's a time for peace well it's war right now and if the devil wants war we will give him war i'm not going to back down i'm not going to give up i'm not going to backslide can the church say man you may be cheating if i have to drag myself into the house of god i'll drag myself but i'm going to praise him i'm going to love him i'm going to save him i said in the service on wednesday people aren't convinced that this is real you know people are not persuaded judgment is coming they've gotten so used to the way the world is that people don't really believe that this world is coming to an end the devil has brought so much stuff to keep you so occupied to keep you away from the word that's why it's so important that's where the bible says as the day approaches gather yourselves together more often because the devil will accelerate your distractions god said for the true bride they would not be just be suddenly worshippers alone they love to worship they love to hear the word so if you call a monday service they're going to be there you call a tuesday service they want to be there they wonder when in service but but i don't have time for my family i'd have time for this i want to go and do this yes you want to do that and then when you have to account for your life you'll say well i already took time to study and that'll be your reason for why you're busy rapture when you are standing on sinking sand and there's only one rock of safety only one rock of safety we have to put the priorities right because god wants to build a church and god's gonna have a church whether it's two or three or five or ten people he will have a church and this building i'm not talking about this building i'm not talking about this physical church god will have a church it'll be his church he will be head of that church can the church say amen i want to be in that church do you want to be in that church just after brother branham said oh it's wonderful joy unspeakable and full of glory but i said when that robe comes in there there's a little hidden power that comes down in your heart that all devils in hell can't make you doubt it could you imagine when there's a power inside your soul that the no devil could make you tout it that hidden power but if adam said not a great big something across your forehead and a doctor of divinity it's a hidden power it's on the inside he said it's been god's program since the first lamb was slain outside of eden he said samson had it he had a hidden power what was it a touch of the holy ghost he said people say samson was big he said listen that would be no mystery to me to see a man with shoulders like bandos to slay a lion or take up a gate and walk away with it but samson was just a little pity mama's boy a little curly headed shrimp about like that now that's what fooled the people can the church say man he was just an ordinary boy had seven little curls hanging down his back looked like a little sisi you can't make this stuff up this is the prophet that's right everybody will laugh at him a type of the holy ghost church and he was a weakling but when the hour come that god wanted to use him he was a giant brother but the branham said that's what fooled them and god's gonna use you to fool the devil to fool the critics he said you may be seated god wants a church that he can lay his hands on and okay how little it is two or three gathered in my name i'll be there in the midst god is gonna have somebody god's gonna have somebody who will stay focused on making this thing live can the church say man do i have a witness today is there somebody here today who want to see this live whether i maintain my family let me maintain christ whether all the world turns against me let me maintain christ whether i lose my job let me maintain christ because heaven and earth will pass away but this world will never never never pass away let me tell you something brother god wants a church that moves in the divine will of god based upon thus saith the lord god will build his church upon the foundation of jesus christ and that's the bible outside of that all other grounds is sinking his hands god doesn't change his nature does not change he's the same yesterday today and forever can the church say amen god has waited for a long time to build this church a long time he has waited to build this church and god will not let me or you or anybody else stop this church can the church say amen he will have a perfect church a church that sin cannot stay in that church a church without spot or wrinkle a church at the moment you come upstairs you are healed without hands even being laid on but the branham said right now we pray for the sick but in that time we'll command the devil to leave hallelujah you don't hear me in that time we will command the devil cancer leave tumor leave at rightist leave blindness leave oh glory to god hallelujah high blood pressure leave it's got to go wide an adopted son will be speaking a son with the sea german the body the same power that jesus had people were healing peter's shadow peter wasn't even praying as peter walked his shadow he didn't have to come and touch with his shadow and you were healed what kind of church is that that's the kind of church that jesus came to build upon this rock i will build my church up this church nothing will stop it the first church you may be seeing the first church was in the garden of eden then god built a church with the apostles and that church fell but this was a master plan because god purposed himself to give the devil the final knockout punch god wanted to hit the devil where it hurts the most to build his eden to build it the best way he wanted to build it because god when he finished eden it was beautiful it was perfect there was no mistake nothing was out of place and the devil went into god's eden and upset the plan of god so god told satan go ahead go ahead and satan has built the best his best edom all the technology all the fashions all the styles everybody in place of all the politics everything looking nice and god is saying yes now i'm gonna have my people come and that eden all sin will be around them all hell will be against them but they're not gonna fall they are not gonna fail they're gonna have power they're gonna speak the world and it'll flash like lightning wait till the seven thunders utter their voices to that group what they see is gonna happen hallelujah glory to god somebody give god a shout out pray you may be seated but the brown said missing limbs will be restored it takes revelation to even repeat that you mean i don't even have to have a hand and god could speak a hand into existence what did he tell moses moses i was the one who made mountain i was the one who made your tongue i was the man who made your head what are you telling me what are you gonna say i will give you power i'm a creator i will create if there's a spine bone missing i'll put it back because i am god i don't need permission to fix you i don't need permission to heal you i don't need permission to take the pieces of your life and pray put it back together hallelujah somebody's saying man you may be seated god didn't ask permission to put the sun in place he didn't ask permission to put the moon in place and all things god will move whatever he has to move to get you into your place of god waiting to place his church into position you may be seated brother branham taught us perfect fate is based on your position you see when you know what your position is and you know what your authority is and you know what your power is oh you know god almighty wait till the church gets to know who she is she'll be an invincible army what is invincible mean nothing will stop you nothing will stop you nothing will stop you the gates of hell will never prevail never prevail you may be seated i'm feeling good i'm feeling good that's why we came here to church you may be seated i want this to rest deep on the inside inside because listen it's not just about this feeling i was sharing with them in digger martin on wednesday i said a lot of people love to deal with the symptom and not deal with the problem so when you get sick you want the doctor to give you a painkiller to kill the pain but the fact that pain exists is because there's some kind of bacteria virus or infection so people want to get the pain removed but they don't want god to operate and perform the surgery to cut out the infection can the church say amen so this sin problem sin is not the symptom sin is the root cause of the problem so when you see somebody smoking drinking fornication adultery those are all symptoms of the problem and some people come to church they just want the symptom address they want to come to church and feel good and then by wednesday by thursday they're a different person but god is coming with a knife today the knife of the world to perform surgery to make sure all the bad parts get cut out all the jealousy envy lust movie spirit evil spirit lion spirit you know what you have what the knife is here the table is open tonight we can do multiple surgeries tonight it doesn't have to be one at a time god is able to do simultaneous surgeries he's the only doctor to operate on everybody in the room at the same time at the same time you don't have to wait your turn he is operating right now oh do you know this jesus that i'm speaking about hallelujah you may be seated i'm not going to be too much longer with you but upon this rock i will build my church it is not the responsibility of the pastors to build the church of the teachers to build the church jesus himself identified in matthew 16 who accepted the responsibility to build a church he said upon this rock i will build my church jesus is in the construction business jesus is in the building business jesus is in every kind of business he's not going to trust man to build this church all god wants is to give you a revelation and that revelation is to send you to your destination you're going to get it to the minute don't worry you you you gonna get it your revelation is to guarantee your destination because if god reveals himself to you it don't matter if you backslide that revelation is locked to your destination i'm jumping ahead of myself but you maybe see them this same peter who said tower to christ and jesus said upon this rock i build my church flesh and blood and reveal this to you later in matthew 16 when jesus was revealing finally himself to them peter said no i don't where you die jesus said get behind me satan the same peter with the revelation when jesus was about to be crucified this same peter was like i know i was not in church i don't know the church i don't know jesus i don't know james john them fellas this same peter when jesus died he said i am going fishing jesus took him from fishing listen without backsliding and signing right back to where he starts to know he didn't just backslide and say well let me just go and fast and pray no he said i'm going to take back my net right back where she doesn't find me i'm going right back there you have degrees of backsliding you know this is slide back to point one you see i go fishing right where jesus finds me as if only three and a half years don't matter just wipe it off push and then brothers with no revelation say well we're going fishing matthew attacks collector he don't he never pull a line in his life complete backslidden condition deny christ did they take away the revelation no that revelation somehow pulled him to the upper room he was nervous in the upper room but the brandon said they haul themselves in that room and you know what hall mean like you drag yourself he didn't walk in the upper room god bless you this is upper room service no no no fellas take the time it was pressure but when they got to the upper room the bible said when the day of pentecost was fully come brother that's seeing peter that seeing peter when the holy ghost when he got his own lick of fire not james like a fire not john licker fire when he got his own lick of fire he said these men are not drunk as you suppose we might be acting drunk we might be looking drunk you might not understand all of my words but this is that that the prophet joel spoke about you could watch me but you can't touch me and gold i don't have but such as i have i can give to you because the holy ghost i pray this helps somebody today to look differently at your trials look differently at your situations look differently at your problems and look to your destination which is the upper room your personal experience with the pillar of fire it's between you and god by yourself you maybe see this my my mind upon this rock rock a revelation so let me drop this in every age had a revelation so i thank god for a prophet who took the revelation from each church age seven revelations seven voices seven confessions seven thunders and upon this rock of the entire revelation we can now rebuild the church by the power of the spirit to build a super church a super race as we near the headstone a church that will be the final voice to the final age where you will have power to speak for your children to speak for your wife to speak for your husband to speak for your situation you won't even need a pastor to speak you will have power to speak yourself can the church say man let me skip some of it you already preached me out already just going to read two more quotes and then get ready to close out with iran i'm in the message revelation of jesus christ said let me show you another reason why satan hates this book of revelation of jesus christ in the church but i'm taught that satan hates two books in particular genesis and revelation because if the church gets a revelation she's unstoppable this is brother branham he said he knows this is satan knows that jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever and he changes not he knows that a whole lot more than do 90 of the theologians he knows that since god is immutable in his nature and that word immutable means unchanging in his nature then he is just as immutable or unchanging in his ways thus satan knows assortedly that the original church at pentecost with the power of god saint mark 16 in action is the true church that jesus christ claims as his own and all else is false now remember this christ in the true church is a continuation of the book of acts but the book of revelation shows that the antichrist spirit would come into the church and defile it make it lukewarm formal and powerless the book of revelation exposes satan revealing his works right down to the time he is cast into the lake of fire and he fights that he cannot stand it he knows that if the people get the true revelation of the true church and what she is what she stands for and that she could do the greater work she will be an invincible army if they get a true revelation of the two spirits within the framework of the christian church and by god's spirit discern and withstand the antichrist spirit satan will be powerless before her can the church say amen is that the kind of church we're looking for where we can discern the spirit in the church and withstand the antichrist spirit and withstand the worldly fashion and the styles can the church see him so after jesus said i will all say also unto thee in verse 18 that what peter and upon this rock i will build my church and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it and then jesus goes on and speaks of the authority that he is placing in the church and he said i will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven that whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven and whatsoever thou shalt loosen it shall be loosed in heaven and this authority still rest in the church today can the church say amen this authority is still here today and today we are losing souls that have been in bondage for a long time but you are set free today to possess your individual inheritance the musicians can get ready now notice this friends after the revelation comes out in verse 21 the bible says and this is what jesus was really trying to get to all along because he wanted to share certain things with his disciples but he could not tell them until he was sure they knew who he was then the bible says from that time forth began jesus to show unto his disciples how that he must go into jerusalem and suffer many things of the elders and chief priests and scribes and be killed and be raised again the third day then peter took him and began to rebuke him peter is really something else peter began to rebuke jesus see be far from the lord this shall not be unto thee but he turned and said unto peter get thee behind me satan thou art on offense unto me for those savoriest not the things that be of god but those that be of men what do you savor today is it the things of god or or is it the things of men and then jesus goes on and as a musician begin to play something softly and then jesus shares something really powerful then jesus said unto his disciples if any man will come after me let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me amen deny yourself means denying the things that you want to do the things that you like to do deny yourself of your dreams and visions and passions and take up his cross and follow me follow follow after jesus jesus is saying if if if any man will come after me let him deny himself that is one of the hardest things to do to deny yourself because it's so easy for you to have your plans your dreams your ambitions your desires what you want to achieve what you like to see for yourself and how you want to see your house and your your family and whatever it is god is saying deny yourself and follow me amen for whosoever this is scripture whosoever shall save his life shall lose it so any attempt that you make to save your life you're going to lose it but whoever shall lose his life for my sake shall find it and the challenge today is how many of us are really ready to give it all away for jesus to give it all away that he could really be the driver of this car just this life and verse 26 says for what is a man profited it's so paradoxical how in this one chapter of matthew 16 is such a journey to this one chapter from jesus battle with the pharisees to him reminding his disciples of how he broke bread and fed for five thousand then he asked them who do men say i am then and who do you say i am and he tells them the authority that upon revelation i'll build my church and i'm gonna give you the keys and then he ends with her with a sermon a powerful sin and a message in and of itself what is a man profited if he shall gain the whole world and lose his own soul or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul so many times we find ourselves fighting doing this running doing this trying to do this trying to achieve this trying to gain the whole world and our soul is at risk some time ago i said at a house meeting i'm not too bothered by your feelings your emotions your self-esteem their their times we spend time talking about these things but your esteem goes up and down your feelings go up and down their days your sadder days that you're happy what i'm concerned about is the destination of your soul because you could have high self-esteem and lose your soul you could have money in the bank and you could lose your soul your marriage could be perfect and you could lose your soul you could have the best children in the world and and lose your soul you could be respected in your community and you could lose your soul you could be jumping and shouting in church and lose your soul you could be a minister and lose your soul you could be a pastor and lose your soul elder deacon trusty and lose your soul don't you take that risk with your soul if other people want to give their soul up to the world that's that's them deny yourself deny yourself some of the friends that you want to keep around you deny yourself some of the places that you want to go to deny yourself some of the books that you want to read deny yourself some of the things that you want to see deny yourself for the sake of christ is there anyone here today who doesn't know jesus it's a real deep question because many people don't know jesus they know church you know the message they know books they know tapes but they have never had a personal encounter with jesus to hear that still small voice saying go and sin no more that still small voice saying have you decided to follow me that still small voice that says whatever you shall lose for my sake you're gonna gain so much more maybe there's one person here today that's why we call this a restoration service to restore your contact with god to restore your relationship with god to restore your communication with god to restore your prayer life with god and to reach the point in your life that you are truly ready not just to sing the song i give myself away but to really give yourself away lord i give i give my friends away i give i give everything away because i give it all away i give it i give myself away my own thoughts my own feelings my own ambitions i give it all away i give it i give it all away because this revelation is so real to me i want to be part of that church lord i'm ready today to give it all away if i lose my job i give it away today if i lose my prestige i give it all away people can laugh at me but i give it all away branham said god cannot build this church and a bunch of nonsense you can't dress how you want live how you want you have to give away how you want to dress give away how you want to live give away how you want to act because you want to follow christ not follow the church not follow the past or follow christ that's what we are preaching today brother branham came to point to christ i'm pointing to christ that same jesus and as we approach easter palm sunday good friday easter sunday jesus in matthew 16 was sharing something intimate with his disciples as he said i'm about to go to jerusalem i'm about to suffer many things he wasn't suffering for himself he was suffering for us i'm about to be beaten i'm about to be bruised i'm about to be laughed at mark spit on and i'm gonna die a painful death whosoever wants to follow me deny yourself deny yourself today deny yourself today deny yourself today may the lord bless you lift your hands up close your eyes oh hallelujah give him praise just give him worship right where you are just worship him oh right where you are just begin to communion with him this evening oh hallelujah
