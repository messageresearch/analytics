[19:49] Matthew 25 and reading from verse 1
[19:53] thank you the Gideon Matthew 25 and
[20:00] verse 1 then shall the Kingdom of Heaven
[20:04] be likened unto ten virgins which took
[20:08] their lamps and went forth to meet the
[20:10] bridegroom and five of them were wise
[20:12] and five were foolish they that were
[20:15] foolish took their lamps and took no oil
[20:17] with them but the wise took oil in their
[20:21] vessels with their lamps while the
[20:24] bridegroom tarried they all slumbered
[20:25] and slept and at midnight there was a
[20:28] cry made behold the bridegroom cometh go
[20:30] ye out to meet him then all those
[20:33] virgins arose and trimmed their lamps
[20:34] and the foolish said to the wise give us
[20:37] of your oil for our lamps are going out
[20:39] but the wise answered saying not so lest
[20:43] there be not enough for us and you but
[20:45] go ye rather to them that sell and buy
[20:48] for yourselves and while they went to
[20:51] buy the bridegroom came and they that
[20:54] were ready went in with him to the
[20:56] marriage and the door was shut
[20:58] afterward came also the other virgins
[21:00] saying Lord Lord open to us but he
[21:03] answered and said verily I say unto you
[21:05] I know you not watch therefore for ye
[21:09] know neither the day nor the hour
[21:11] wherein the Son of man cometh
[21:14] middle-order the blessing to the reading
[21:15] of his word he may be seated tonight in
[21:18] the presence of the Lord is such a great
[21:20] privilege to be back in the house of the
[21:22] Lord tonight and I really was blessed on
[21:24] Sunday how many were blessed on Sunday
[21:26] the double service the pillar of fire by
[21:29] the Anthony in the morning and brother
[21:31] over it in the evening your thoughts
[21:33] your testimony your life really really
[21:37] really a tremendous tremendous time and
[21:40] we looking for God to continue to do
[21:43] something for us in a special way
[21:44] tonight and I have a little thought
[21:46] tonight making preparation
[21:49] for the coming of the Lord making
[21:52] preparations for the coming of the Lord
[21:55] and in the message looking for Jesus but
[21:58] Abraham said now we want to speak us
[22:00] every meeting so this is my desire
[22:02] tonight about Jesus Christ he's a center
[22:04] for worship the center of our attraction
[22:07] the center of all of our life all that
[22:11] we have and want are and will be is
[22:14] based upon him he was the one who came
[22:17] and gave his life for us scheme down
[22:19] from God out of glory and was made flesh
[22:21] dwelt among us and taken upon him the
[22:24] sin of us all the sickness of us all boy
[22:27] awaits at Calvary and they appeared the
[22:29] price he's worthy of all the praise that
[22:31] can be given him do you feel that way
[22:33] this evening that he is worthy of all
[22:36] the praise that can be given to him and
[22:38] in God had a provided way I'm gonna is
[22:40] gonna touch in a few quotes God likes to
[22:43] show his power not that he has to but he
[22:46] loves to do it that's really powerful so
[22:48] he loves to do it it pleases him in his
[22:50] omnipotence to let his subjects know who
[22:53] he is and and he lets his subjects know
[22:55] who he is by his power but everyone said
[22:57] I'm so happy of it because he showed me
[22:59] his power so we talking tonight about
[23:02] preparations and Mary banner said before
[23:04] God before you want more of God there's
[23:07] got to be more of God to respond to that
[23:09] crave so before God could have a desire
[23:11] in your heart that needs to be filled
[23:13] the the thing that is supposed to fill
[23:16] the desire how to exist before the
[23:18] desire could be there so there had to be
[23:20] some preparations mean before there
[23:23] could be a desire to have what has been
[23:24] prepared can the church say mmm so we're
[23:27] building to something but Abraham said
[23:29] the people in the spirit of the latter
[23:30] days the nations are in the spirit of
[23:33] the end time they got atomic weapons
[23:35] hydrogen weapons all kinds of things
[23:37] because it's a spirit of the deal
[23:40] the people are in the spirit of the
[23:42] endtime the church is moving together
[23:44] under the power and the impact of the
[23:46] Holy Spirit the world is running out
[23:48] yonder and making fun scoffing laughing
[23:50] and they living like the devil every day
[23:52] it's in the spirit of the thing God's
[23:55] getting ready to take his and the devil
[23:57] is getting ready to take his so it's a
[24:00] preparation thing that's going on
[24:02] God is getting ready the devil is
[24:04] getting ready the world is getting ready
[24:06] the church is getting ready the bride is
[24:08] getting ready this preparation that's
[24:10] happening all the time you may not think
[24:13] something is going on but you are
[24:14] getting ready the student who is going
[24:16] to school when you are not studying you
[24:19] are getting ready you're getting ready
[24:20] to fail because if you're not studying
[24:22] you're actually preparing yourself for
[24:24] failure but the person who is studying
[24:26] you're preparing yourself to overcome
[24:28] you're preparing yourself to pass the
[24:30] exam because you're putting things in
[24:32] place because you're getting ready so
[24:34] even when you think you're doing nothing
[24:36] you actually still making preparation
[24:38] because separation is always going on
[24:40] can the church mmm
[24:42] nobody brand himself before God does
[24:44] anything he always prepares for it
[24:47] so God is not now deciding to do
[24:49] something he already prepared for it
[24:52] before he could do anything there has
[24:54] been a preparation made can the church
[24:57] amen but if I said before we go over to
[25:00] fight a wall first we have to prepare
[25:02] for the war you don't go to war without
[25:04] having some type of preparation some
[25:06] type of plan what am I going to do if
[25:08] you want to travel somewhere you got to
[25:10] make preparation you can't travel
[25:11] without a passport you can travel
[25:13] without a ticket
[25:14] so you need to think about the passport
[25:16] before you could travel you have to
[25:18] think about the ticket before you could
[25:19] travel if you need clothes for the
[25:21] environment and you're going to you have
[25:23] to have clothes packed in your bag to
[25:25] meet the conditions that you're about to
[25:26] meet and with a random set to get over
[25:28] there you have to have divine love
[25:30] packed in your bag before you can get
[25:32] over there so you got to make
[25:33] preparations here so that you can meet
[25:35] the condition that exists over there
[25:37] can the church same and so for our title
[25:40] tonight making preparations for the
[25:42] coming of the Lord before you could
[25:44] fight you got to make preparation before
[25:46] you can run a marathon you can't just
[25:48] wake up if you wake up in the morning
[25:49] and you have not been working out
[25:51] there's no marathon that you could run
[25:53] before you go 10 15 20 minutes you don't
[25:56] burn out if you want to run a marathon
[25:57] if you want to run a sprint a
[25:59] long-distance runner those people
[26:01] practice if it's every team every other
[26:04] team they watch what they eat they watch
[26:06] how they rest they do their push-ups
[26:08] they do their setups they do everything
[26:10] because they know what they are
[26:11] preparing to and if we are prepared for
[26:14] if we are prepared for a resurrection if
[26:16] we are preparing for wedding supper if
[26:18] you're prepared for a healing if you're
[26:20] prepared for deliverance there's got to
[26:22] be some preparation that we are making

[29:57] just waited for the call it's time to
[29:59] leave it's time to leave but before we
[30:02] get that call there's got to be a power

[30:14] unto you and to your children so you are
[30:17] getting prepared to prepare them by fire
[30:20] by power by marriage so we can leave
[30:24] this place and the church say man
[30:27] Oh glory he may be seated
[30:31] the children of Israel went out the
[30:34] chilling abyssal would hear the cheering
[30:36] events our world living in pondage
[30:38] didn't know their head from their foot
[30:40] he didn't know how they were gonna make
[30:42] it out they had been in bondage for so
[30:44] long
[30:45] didn't even thought it was a distant
[30:47] memory that a deliverer was gonna come
[30:50] but when Court is ready to have a
[30:51] deliverance he puts a man in there who
[30:54] can handle it and God flipped it so
[30:57] smooth he slipped Moses to be fed
[30:59] clothed and trained in Egypt so that he
[31:02] had the best food he had the best
[31:04] clothes he had the best education and
[31:06] when Cora's more prepared for him
[31:08] you see no common going to the desert
[31:10] and toe-out a little bit
[31:12] what is going to hit already he's making
[31:15] sure the conditions are right he's
[31:16] making sure everything is in place
[31:18] God loves he's a chess player he loves
[31:21] to put this piece here and put this
[31:23] piece here
[31:24] he said not yet not yet not yet but when
[31:26] he's ready here comes Moses coming down
[31:28] into Egypt what Kingdom do you represent
[31:31] the kingdom of the Most High what God do
[31:34] you represent I don't know if you know
[31:35] his name but he said I am that I am sent
[31:38] me come on somebody preach back to me
[31:42] you know what I love the children of
[31:45] Israel dearly have feet but Moses is
[31:47] feed for them was bigger than the tow
[31:49] taker of even oh come on somebody preach
[31:52] back to me the faith in the experience
[31:55] that Moses had was bigger than the tote
[31:58] the collective tote could not destroy
[32:00] Moses feet come the church say Amen
[32:04] because when hero increase the work that
[32:07] was under people they had to have feet
[32:09] in something and they had to trust that
[32:10] Moses knew what he was talking about
[32:12] because it's not a damn mama they see
[32:14] you talking deliverance and the child's
[32:16] got heavier you're talking breakthrough
[32:18] and the pressure increase and Moses has
[32:20] extremos other people hang in there just
[32:23] keep watching God is getting ready he's
[32:25] getting ready to break Pharaoh he's
[32:27] getting ready to set you free
[32:28] he's getting ready to restore your
[32:30] children what your grandfather went
[32:32] through that your children don't have to
[32:33] go through because the deliverer has
[32:35] come I had to wait all these years I was
[32:38] waiting for you to
[32:39] get here I was waiting for children to
[32:41] get here because somebody have to go
[32:43] over to the promised land
[32:45] somebody say man you may be seated
[32:51] hallelujah dear collective doubt let me
[32:55] say it again the collective doubt of the
[32:57] people was not enough to the minister
[33:00] faith Moses had Sarah's feeling about
[33:02] her woman our condition was not big
[33:05] enough the doubt she had could not open
[33:07] the feet that Abraham had come on now
[33:09] somebody speak to me
[33:11] so tonight I'm not talking about the
[33:13] faith of your family the night I'm not
[33:15] talking about the feet of your children
[33:17] I'm talking about your feet being
[33:19] prepared to come to perfect fate because
[33:22] public sale is based on the position
[33:25] that you're standing in and all these
[33:27] the escort has been preparing you for
[33:29] your position as a son and daughter in
[33:31] the economy of God somebody's Amen
[33:34] tonight Oh hallelujah can the church say
[33:40] man David didn't know you may be seated
[33:43] that when he came to play Lee hop timber
[33:47] Ovid preached it that he was being
[33:49] prepared for the throne but you don't
[33:51] just get to the throne you got to
[33:53] understand how the throne room operates
[33:55] you got to understand who has the
[33:57] influence over where the ice bucket is
[33:59] you have to know which fan man is the
[34:01] man who controls the fans you have to
[34:03] understand which security guard but keep
[34:05] certain people out so I'm giving us here
[34:07] playing the harp he is watching what's
[34:09] moving he knows who he gotta talk to
[34:12] he knows who has what influence what is
[34:14] God doing preparing David because one
[34:17] day this little boy is going to be a
[34:18] king he didn't even understand what he
[34:20] was walking into but Cora's making
[34:22] preparations and God has been preparing
[34:24] you in your job in your school all these
[34:27] years every action every action is
[34:30] course preparation from the church say
[34:32] men but Abraham said God hidden sundry
[34:37] times he wanted his children to have the
[34:40] best do you believe that
[34:42] God wants you to have the best yes
[34:46] here's something nice in him he has here
[34:48] something good enough
[34:50] he ain't wanna have now said he said
[34:51] what he what he have the best so if
[34:55] you're not the best yet it means you're
[34:57] still Airy so what God's plan is for
[34:58] your life because he wanted us to have
[35:02] the best
[35:02] so he made preparations so his
[35:05] preparation is for you to have what the
[35:07] best and the church same and so he
[35:10] foreshadowed it through with prophets he
[35:12] had revealed it in Christ and the table
[35:15] is set today and every man and woman
[35:17] that's inviting us all welcome to come
[35:19] to this table for he was wounded for our
[35:21] transgressions and with His stripes we
[35:24] were healed it's all foreseen it's
[35:27] provided and prepared the meal is ready
[35:30] the call is given he foresaw it he made
[35:34] preparations it's God's provided way for
[35:37] you when your soul is hungry can the
[35:40] church Haman and Betty one said call
[35:43] always prepares the people for the
[35:45] events that's just about to happen so
[35:48] everything that's happening right now
[35:50] God has prepared his people for what's
[35:52] about to happen and I know in recent
[35:54] times at all these coronavirus
[35:57] understand that you have a lot of people
[35:58] people living in Salem people making all
[36:02] kind of memes and jokes and comments and
[36:04] thing and it's a real thing it's a real
[36:06] people living in fear I mean one thing
[36:12] that Jesus said a lot was for fear not
[36:14] fear not till about 63 times you see a
[36:17] fear not fear not whenever is fear not
[36:20] you see for God hath not given us a
[36:21] spirit of fear so it is not in the
[36:26] vocabulary of Christians you see I'm
[36:28] afraid er what I mean fact where the
[36:30] branch said be reckless and fearless
[36:34] anybody with me tonight
[36:37] I'm very balanced and some of God's
[36:40] preparation has been so ridiculous to
[36:42] the people who depend on a tree of
[36:44] knowledge because God's preparation has
[36:47] been absolutely ridiculous to the
[36:49] natural mind because a natural mind can
[36:52] conceive the things that are of God
[36:54] because they are foolishness to him and
[36:56] he just think the thing is horrible to
[36:59] say why would God do something
[37:00] can the church say Amen so the whole
[37:02] world is preparing for funeral service
[37:04] but there are some people who are
[37:06] preparing for the resurrection they are
[37:08] preparing for the rapture they are
[37:10] preparing for the wedding supper listen
[37:12] if you want to take part in you Olympics
[37:14] I saw some training years ago for one of
[37:17] these swimmers in the Olympic race and
[37:18] listen it was not just women you know
[37:21] it's every kind of hard exercise and I
[37:24] said for three years you have a routine
[37:26] because you want to win and it lasted me
[37:28] he was this far from it a little bit and
[37:30] the amount of work what is it it's
[37:32] preparation that needs to be made can
[37:35] the church same and so there are people
[37:38] who are preparing because Jesus is
[37:40] coming for bride and by faith and
[37:42] declaring tonight the final call is one
[37:45] behold the bridegroom cometh
[37:47] I'm on the expectation because we have a
[37:49] purpose we have a destination but before
[37:52] we leave here god has got to give us
[37:54] something kind of church shame and now
[37:57] God but everyone said cannot make a
[37:59] decision today and tomorrow come back
[38:01] and make a better decision because his
[38:03] first decision is perfect he never has
[38:06] to change it so we can rest upon
[38:08] whatever God says can the church say
[38:10] Amen it's not something we can rest upon
[38:14] whatever he says because he cannot come
[38:16] and make a better decision so when God
[38:18] called you there's no better plan he
[38:20] could put in place you already call you
[38:21] that's the best plan in place
[38:23] he picked the best out of everybody to
[38:26] give them this great gospel this great
[38:28] message and they're true many churches
[38:30] many groups many countries but they're
[38:32] all called on the one Lord on the one
[38:35] feet under one baptism can the church
[38:38] say man and it's always been God's Way
[38:41] to let his people know what's gonna
[38:43] happen before it happens he doesn't let
[38:46] everybody know he doesn't let
[38:48] though the wool itself no but he lets
[38:51] his children or predestinated people or
[38:54] call out people so we are not surprised
[38:56] can the church see mmm by what's
[38:58] happening in the political around we're
[38:59] not surprised by what's happening in the
[39:01] economic realm we're not surprised by
[39:04] was happening with wars and plagues and
[39:06] rumors of wars before the rain could
[39:08] fall in the days of Noah God had to let
[39:10] nor know what's going to happen
[39:12] he couldn't even judge Sodom and
[39:14] Gomorrah without elected Abraham know
[39:16] what is gonna happen he said how can I
[39:19] hide from Abraham what I'm about to do
[39:22] hallelujah and the relationship God had
[39:25] with Abraham was different than the one
[39:27] he has with you because you are pride
[39:29] you are wife he will have to let you
[39:32] know what he's about to do before he
[39:35] does anything he's gonna make sure that
[39:37] you are in the place you're supposed to
[39:39] be in before anything could happen to
[39:41] you and the church say man his love for
[39:44] you
[39:44] that's how love is love wants to reach
[39:46] out to you to let you know what's gonna
[39:48] happen
[39:48] can the church say Amen so no I was not
[39:52] surprised by when the rain began to fall
[39:55] no one knew how the story would end
[39:57] because God showed him the end because
[40:00] God is the beginning and the end he
[40:02] could show the end of the story before
[40:04] the turn of Israel when pundits quote
[40:06] already told the end before the pondage
[40:09] he said with a mighty hand I'll bring
[40:11] them out he spoke of deliverance before
[40:13] they even went hit abundant come on now
[40:15] somebody preached back to me oh come on
[40:20] now so you don't think God knows all the
[40:22] struggles and the trials you went
[40:24] through and already nobody and looking
[40:26] like and he already kicked that end and
[40:28] true foreknowledge wrote your name in
[40:30] the book
[40:31] that's no devil career is it no
[40:34] situation I can move it no child could
[40:36] destroy it in fact he said what shall
[40:39] separate us from the love and cup pass
[40:41] person pestilence fear nothing so
[40:47] tonight we know how the story's gonna
[40:49] end
[40:49] oh we know our end and we know the
[40:52] devil's end I know my end because I
[40:55] don't have an ending come on somebody
[40:57] preach back to me oh the devil things
[40:59] you know so you
[41:00] gonna end but I have no in there because
[41:02] I always was in corner Oh everything
[41:05] that had a beginning has an end name we
[41:07] never had a beginning because we were
[41:09] always a part of God but the devil had a
[41:12] beginning and he has to have an ending
[41:14] can the church say man this is what
[41:16] you've been preparing for Oh hallelujah
[41:21] Oh blessed be the name of the Lord
[41:26] Oh right now your story might be filled
[41:28] up and looking on the ups and down but
[41:30] God already knows how your story is
[41:33] gonna end
[41:33] Oh at the end of your story I see the
[41:36] rapture at the end of your story I see
[41:38] your family at the end of the story I
[41:40] see a smile on your face at the end know
[41:42] your story us here your gray hair tune

[42:39] hottest child the hottest testing Oh
[42:42] glory to God that be who have gone
[42:44] before without us could never be made
[42:46] perfect they are wondering how we could
[42:49] make it because this age is the age of
[42:51] deception this age is the age of false
[42:53] doctrine and false teaching this age is
[42:55] so slippery it's so easy to fall on one
[42:59] side and fall on the next side it was
[43:01] easy in those days you know you believe
[43:03] you don't believe now its doctrine is
[43:05] creted Dogma it's just it's sad and

[43:18] their part in the preparing God did his
[43:21] part in the preparing he sent His
[43:24] Prophet Oh hallelujah
[43:26] to prepare a way for a bride to meet the
[43:28] bridegroom come on now
[43:30] no we have to get ready his wife has
[43:34] made herself ready oh you may be seated
[43:39] so the devil only has a short time to
[43:42] try to stop you every day you make it up
[43:45] in the morning the devil see another day
[43:46] I'm now another day because he knows the
[43:49] countdown is on he knows he listen when
[43:52] the devil knows something is about to
[43:53] change he tries everything in a win when
[43:55] the deliverer was born he's had to kill
[43:56] everybody when Jesus Bush had to kill
[44:00] everybody so when he see the intensity
[44:02] of the attack is him trying to wipe out
[44:04] you heard what the pastor said the boss
[44:06] tried to lick him down did they try to
[44:07] drown him to try to kill him and that's
[44:09] the devil trying everything he could and
[44:11] we all of our testimonies what we have
[44:13] seen on what he have not seen because
[44:15] core dispatch angels to prepare our way
[44:18] for you hallelujah when you don't even
[44:20] see the angels they are at your left
[44:22] they are right in front of you big why
[44:25] because you are son of the king
[44:26] you testin know you a royalty you walk
[44:29] in the school thinking you that's
[44:30] another school boy you think another
[44:32] school girl but you didn't even see the
[44:34] angels who are marching in front of you
[44:37] you sitting in your class and see good
[44:39] morning sir good morning miss and all
[44:41] around that room because of you angels
[44:44] just dispatched around you you kind of
[44:47] fly down a taxi and the interesting not
[44:49] this one not this one not this one and
[44:51] all of a sudden a couple of you don't
[44:54] know why it stopped for you but it was
[44:55] angels of state formation because they
[44:58] have to go where you go you walk and
[45:01] Istanbul you know how you're made at
[45:03] home you don't know what kept you alive
[45:04] but there was something over you what is
[45:07] it God calling from the ladies from the
[45:10] west from the north from the south
[45:12] Lix of fire he already seen the liquor
[45:15] fire hanging over your head one body
[45:21] made up of different members and we are
[45:24] not leaving this place until every man
[45:27] take its place
[45:28] Oh hallelujah you don't hear me tonight
[45:32] can the church say Amen we're not
[45:35] leaving here until every man is in his
[45:37] place when this body is ready to move
[45:40] when every man is in position but a
[45:42] bouncer won't end the last steam could
[45:44] be in Africa somewhere but one day the
[45:46] last name will be called and that last
[45:48] thing will take its place and that last
[45:50] name will meet the pillar of fire and
[45:52] the pillar of fire will move from God
[45:54] above us accord with us to court in US
[45:57] and then when that last one is in its
[45:59] place when we have all come into the
[46:01] unity of the faith into the knowledge of
[46:03] the Son of God it's an a measure of the
[46:05] stature of the fullness of Christ till
[46:07] there's no more you and me but we are
[46:09] one calling us i sha glory to God you
[46:16] may be seated where he is ahead of the
[46:18] body wherever he moves the body moves
[46:21] where he looks the body looks no more
[46:24] man in the middle of the relationship
[46:26] that's why I say the fivefold ministry
[46:28] is unlimited people don't like to hear
[46:30] that boy is a limited ministry because
[46:32] God always wanted a personal connection
[46:35] with you personal connection with me he
[46:38] want no secretary between you and him
[46:41] you don't want nobody else to represent
[46:43] you before him it was Christ was the
[46:45] only water to even relate to you before
[46:47] him can the church amen
[46:51] making preparations for the resurrection
[46:54] for the rapture for the wedding supper

[50:44] Christ somebody preached back to me
[50:46] they'll look for you you always used to
[50:48] be here but I can't find you because
[50:50] you're hitting it you're hiding inside
[50:51] of Jesus Christ and the church say man
[50:54] or no more you were only attached the
[50:57] preparation until it's not you it's not
[51:00] me and the more you are like Christ and
[51:03] the more hip you are in Christ is you're
[51:05] shaking off this humanistic realm and
[51:08] this
[51:08] humanistic thinking and you begin to
[51:10] reverse the effects of aging well the
[51:14] thing you're talking crazier because the
[51:16] closer you get to God and the more you
[51:18] get like him anymore your behavior your
[51:20] nature your being your attribute
[51:25] you're thinking be gonna change you walk
[51:28] be gonna change your talk begin a change
[51:30] Oh somebody say man I heard recently
[51:34] they did an experiment with some things
[51:38] some people who like over like 70 80
[51:40] years old and the sat with him and he
[51:43] started to talk with him and decided to
[51:44] take them back memory lean to when they
[51:46] were younger back tuck me in and in the
[51:49] situation and existed when they were
[51:50] like in their 20s and I found something
[51:52] very interesting before they did the
[51:54] experiment they put some visual things
[51:56] for them to read and stuff and when they
[51:58] started the same no the yen always
[52:00] nineteen whatever take them back after
[52:02] why the city people like I said the see
[52:04] better because their brains had to tell
[52:06] them they're ready back in nineteen
[52:08] twenty and they started to believe that
[52:10] they were no longer in 2000 or whatever
[52:13] so and the experiment showing how
[52:15] powerful the mind is about your state of
[52:17] behavior so that if you think you're
[52:20] young you're is very true when you have
[52:21] a think you're feeling young I said I
[52:23] move a certain way your body actually
[52:25] respond so you're thinking so when you
[52:27] say I'm defeated your body actually is
[52:29] response to that call' of you being
[52:31] defeated when you say I am tired you
[52:34] know you actually reinforce in sadness
[52:36] you signing it you are proving it
[52:38] you you that's why I let you week see
[52:42] and when you begin to speak a certain
[52:45] way all of a sudden so where he's gonna
[52:47] say I'm getting ready I'm getting ready
[52:48] to leave this place
[52:49] I'm getting ready for my healing I'm
[52:51] getting ready for my deliverance I'm
[52:52] getting ready to welcome my son who's
[52:54] back sitting home all of a sudden things
[52:56] begin to move in please
[52:58] because you are walking in this thing
[53:00] you are prophesying in this thing you
[53:02] are living in an atmosphere you are
[53:04] actually making preparations with your
[53:06] worship you're making preparations with
[53:08] your declarations oh come on now but
[53:12] Icarus your family is coming yes we're
[53:14] gonna say it they're coming oh but I'm
[53:17] Mikey say it they're coming oh but I'm
[53:19] gonna say it they're coming just imagine

[53:23] they they're coming
[53:25] they have to come when he's gonna tell
[53:27] you my family have to come do you know
[53:29] when you speak that they have to wonder
[53:30] if you could hold them because you don't
[53:32] need to have more power so anybody who
[53:35] come aggressive at the table that's why
[53:36] butter brown suggests a boob
[53:37] ooh I'll be boys nah no complicated
[53:41] phrase a BB can say boo so you see when
[53:44] you say boo but everything okay because
[53:47] the devil has no power the devil lost

[53:52] Jesus died on the cross he went I'll
[53:54] take the keys of death take the keys of
[53:56] hell you never walk around saying stevia

[54:09] out of being depressed anytime you can
[54:12] walk out your frustration anytime you
[54:14] could walk out of whatever's holding you

[54:28] woman who welcome to the Prophet with
[54:29] the crutches and before the Prophet and
[54:31] pray for her she just took the crutches
[54:33] and handed to him what it is she walked

[54:37] such a level did she realize that there
[54:40] was nothing stopping her there was
[54:41] nothing holding her back from climbing

[58:01] the church say man and we are an
[58:04] expectation for a seventh on the revival
[58:06] we are an expectation for the coming of
[58:08] the Lord
[58:09] Simeon was an expectation to see the
[58:11] Christ the Bible said Simeon was just
[58:14] under vote and the only way you can get
[58:16] the Holy Ghost is to be just under vote
[58:18] just like the 3,000 souls who were just
[58:20] under vote on the Holy Ghost fell upon
[58:23] him Cornelius was just a new vote and
[58:25] prayed all the time a memorial went up
[58:27] to heaven for his prayers are you
[58:30] building a memorial for your prayers
[58:32] that you could be recognized as a prayer
[58:35] warrior are you looking for something I
[58:37] you default are you running around in
[58:39] another world are you not sure where
[58:41] you're standing you don't know where
[58:42] you're at what are you looking for
[58:44] but Simeon was just and devout waiting
[58:46] for the consolation of Israel and we are
[58:49] waiting for the consolation of the bride
[58:51] a power of God what dynamics to the
[58:53] mechanics and the Holy Ghost was upon
[58:55] Simeon and the Holy Ghost is upon you
[58:58] tonight hallelujah it was revealed to
[59:00] him by the Holy Ghost that he could not
[59:02] see depth and it is revealed to us by
[59:04] the Holy Ghost Ruth a word that we shall
[59:06] not seek that we shall not all sleep it
[59:08] was revealed to us that we are gonna be
[59:10] made perfect it was revealed to us that
[59:12] we are going to be adopted is revealed
[59:14] to us that it's gonna be a power come
[59:16] into your life not just to the church
[59:17] but into your life into your home into
[59:22] your bedroom on your job there be a
[59:24] power that you are gonna have not just
[59:26] the church but you are gonna have your
[59:28] individual inheritance you will have
[59:30] power you will have authority if you
[59:33] shall see this is not the preacher but
[59:35] maybe you if you shall sake and the
[59:38] church say man Simeon was old Simeon was
[59:42] tired
[59:43] Simeon's friends maybe they stopped
[59:45] coming to church but not Simeon because
[59:47] he was under expectation to see the
[59:50] Lord's Christ could you imagine the
[59:51] critics simians critics the Sadducees
[59:54] the Pharisees though whoever it was in
[59:56] church a long time since Simeon who do
[59:58] you think you are you that you wanna see
[1:00:00] the Christ you take all these years you
[1:00:02] think you are important see me another
[1:00:04] high priest you know Eliot a deacon you
[1:00:06] know to you what do you think
[1:00:08] this hand the church semen but nothing
[1:00:10] could stop Simeon from getting up every
[1:00:13] day and being way supposed to be
[1:00:15] adventure today is the day so he was
[1:00:18] making preparations because he didn't
[1:00:20] know what day would come that the Lord's
[1:00:22] Christ will come walking into the temple
[1:00:24] and we don't know what they will come
[1:00:26] that'll be your deal for the Holy Ghost
[1:00:28] your day for your breakthrough so every
[1:00:30] day not just services but every day we
[1:00:33] make preparation hallelujah
[1:00:37] because we are under expectation but
[1:00:40] they Branham an expectation so he sent
[1:00:42] here Noah he was expecting a terrine
[1:00:45] so he made preparations for the rain he
[1:00:48] said Oh make preparations as long as you
[1:00:50] hear God's would then make preparation
[1:00:53] for it to happen
[1:00:53] and wait under expectation or that makes
[1:00:56] me start feeling religious the thing
[1:00:58] that God said will be expecting it and
[1:01:00] if God has promised a revival here we're
[1:01:03] gonna have it
[1:01:04] let's make ready for it if God promised
[1:01:06] to heal let's make ready fit you don't
[1:01:08] have to make preparation for your
[1:01:10] healing kind of Church say man but if I
[1:01:14] said Abram and he started to make
[1:01:15] preparations for this child because if
[1:01:19] you're really expecting a child where do
[1:01:21] US attorney and would you have to make
[1:01:23] the preparation so whenever I'm bored
[1:01:25] crib and buy your toy or whatever see by
[1:01:29] he's sure in that decision is he he he
[1:01:31] really crazy yes that what he were said
[1:01:34] Iran already believe this thing you know
[1:01:35] people could do one levy brambly because
[1:01:38] his life testified he believed it wrong
[1:01:41] way go this morning to the baby store
[1:01:44] where we're sitting again after the
[1:01:48] groceries are going to the baby store I
[1:01:50] have to make up something your dear in
[1:01:53] here our child comment
[1:01:58] oh yeah see here I've already lost it
[1:02:00] now you know or if I'm going through way
[1:02:02] I mean when he was young
[1:02:04] for years he and CH on average have no
[1:02:07] ear on all of us and you know working
[1:02:09] when he rung a rail and Sarah who
[1:02:12] couldn't have a child rail all they
[1:02:14] bolted him walking around the mall happy
[1:02:16] happy happy buying baby this baby this
[1:02:18] baby this baby this
[1:02:20] yeah after year every city baby room
[1:02:24] because Abraham don't know what he egg
[1:02:26] on coming no think about it go ahead and
[1:02:29] tell him is 25 years so when he brought
[1:02:31] me here at Iran study car one time went
[1:02:34] straight to the baby store because feet
[1:02:36] without works is dead and Abraham is the
[1:02:39] father of feet and he staggered not at
[1:02:41] the promise of God but was strong even
[1:02:43] Prince to God so when Abram I feel a
[1:02:46] feeling great you have a grab a child
[1:02:50] and be critics I will hear what you you
[1:02:52] know know after a few months Abraham
[1:02:57] could a satyr it was some of us after a
[1:02:58] few months you say oh gosh I wonder if I
[1:03:00] might ask you know but Abraham the next
[1:03:03] year because you don't have this is a
[1:03:04] year and year after tonight this is the
[1:03:06] and yeah after year Abraham going you
[1:03:09] know which here and and I don't know how
[1:03:11] this is it's a serious thing you know
[1:03:13] because it's against human nature to
[1:03:17] maintain hope against hope because it's
[1:03:20] not as if getting younger every year and
[1:03:24] getting worse I want to think about it
[1:03:27] every year getting worse
[1:03:28] every hit harder to what he believed
[1:03:31] twenty years ago and yet 21 reach Syria
[1:03:35] you ready see we're moving a little
[1:03:37] slower she did 20 years ago
[1:03:39] yeah already let me go on my next story
[1:03:42] because God said we gonna have a child
[1:03:44] why didn't make him preparation fit but
[1:03:48] in all of a sudden when at 25 years come
[1:03:50] you see the unveiling of the
[1:03:52] manifestation of the feet and they
[1:03:54] realize it was worth it for all
[1:03:56] hallelujah was worth it all and God
[1:03:58] didn't tell us what year he was gonna
[1:04:00] fill us he didn't tell us what he is
[1:04:02] gonna call he didn't tell us what year
[1:04:04] he's gonna keep you to break through
[1:04:05] what he egg when I get your new house
[1:04:06] what a yeah you're gonna bless you
[1:04:08] abundantly
[1:04:09] he didn't tell you that but he wanted a
[1:04:11] walking
[1:04:11] don't trust them and keep on living and
[1:04:13] fit it's gonna be well all is well
[1:04:16] remember that that lady whose child died
[1:04:18] and she was heading to the Prophet and
[1:04:20] they asked her what is going on the area
[1:04:22] recognized that there the breaking his
[1:04:23] speed limit and they're gonna have
[1:04:25] demerits of your license you say all as
[1:04:27] well all is well can the church say man
[1:04:34] so if God has promised a revival let's
[1:04:37] make ready for it if God has promised a
[1:04:39] here let's make ready for it
[1:04:40] Oh hallelujah if Jesus said the work
[1:04:43] that I do shall you do also
[1:04:45] let's make ready for it move out
[1:04:48] everything get ready we're right in time
[1:04:51] it'll seem foolish well you not know you
[1:04:55] say well how it's gonna happen in a deal
[1:04:57] like this and when all this I don't care
[1:04:59] what anything contrary is to that it's
[1:05:01] wrong we can't see it I see no hope of
[1:05:04] it look like but if God said so let's do
[1:05:07] it anyhow because God said so it'll
[1:05:09] happen anyhow I'm expecting it can the
[1:05:12] church say ma'am so I'm on the
[1:05:14] expectation for revival so I'm making
[1:05:16] preparation for revival that's what my
[1:05:19] expectation is I'm looking for revival
[1:05:21] I'm looking for something to move I'm
[1:05:22] looking for the spirit to move in the
[1:05:24] face of what is happening everywhere
[1:05:26] I'm under expectation for God to do
[1:05:28] something because we have had a
[1:05:30] miniature the word for all these years
[1:05:32] and the letter killeth but the Spirit is
[1:05:34] what gives life so we're looking for
[1:05:36] life to come into my life into your life
[1:05:38] life to come into your family life to
[1:05:41] come into the church a revival disturb
[1:05:43] the season but I bands had already
[1:05:45] planted and nurtured same an
[1:05:48] old-fashioned singing old-fashioned
[1:05:51] dancing old-fashioned shelton
[1:05:53] old-fashioned plain old-fashioned
[1:05:56] praising give me old-fashioned week and
[1:05:58] the church amen
[1:05:59] Oh what but I've answered every five
[1:06:02] will causes five things do you remember
[1:06:03] is a verifiable bring souls to Christ
[1:06:06] bring the church back to us the
[1:06:08] spiritual condition it should be in it
[1:06:10] brings back close communion with God it
[1:06:13] brings back fellowship among the
[1:06:14] churches it brings back praying for the
[1:06:16] sick these are the five things that
[1:06:18] revival brings are you looking for a
[1:06:19] revival in the church in your life kind
[1:06:22] of church say ma'am but if I said that's
[1:06:24] what we need to know
[1:06:25] in making a valley full of ditches
[1:06:26] that's what really tonight is a good
[1:06:29] old-fashioned backwoods sin killin
[1:06:31] sky-blue religion bleach under the power

[1:06:49] be planted you know the devil has no
[1:06:53] power so he can't attack with power I
[1:06:56] can't attack the power so the devil's
[1:06:58] only weapon is to try to come against
[1:07:00] the wood to try to plant seeds of error
[1:07:04] but the pride cannot be deceived go out
[1:07:07] to it all easiest situation had to come

[1:08:14] hallelujah hallelujah let me get ready
[1:08:17] to wind down touch the scripture that I
[1:08:21] read on a familiar scripture but it's
[1:08:23] really a scripture of preparation of
[1:08:27] getting ready
[1:08:32] blessed be the name of the Lord then
[1:08:34] shall the Kingdom of Heaven be likened
[1:08:35] unto ten virgins which
[1:08:38] took the alarms and went forth to meet
[1:08:39] the bridegroom five wise and five
[1:08:42] foolish all virgins all holy all go into
[1:08:46] church all in the message all have the
[1:08:49] books all have the tapes all nor the
[1:08:52] expectation all nor the requirement all
[1:08:54] understand that the token is a life and
[1:08:57] a token supposed to be displayed and
[1:08:58] they have all these things but some were
[1:09:03] wise and some foolish all have the
[1:09:09] inspiration some inspiration some type
[1:09:12] of inspiration but some wise and some
[1:09:14] foolish all have access to the prophetic
[1:09:17] message all of access to Scripture but
[1:09:20] some wise and some foolish Jesus himself
[1:09:24] settled the debate about who is wise and
[1:09:26] who is foolish he said deal of her
[1:09:28] foolish took their lamps and it took no
[1:09:30] oil with them but the wise took oil in
[1:09:33] their vessels with their lamps in other
[1:09:35] words the wise made preparation there
[1:09:39] was something more that they did they
[1:09:41] were already they did something more
[1:09:45] they put something else in please if
[1:09:47] you're going on a trip you have to make
[1:09:49] preparation I put them gas in your car
[1:09:52] you have a car
[1:09:53] we have no gas we're going doors that
[1:09:57] were foolish took their lamps with no
[1:09:59] oil
[1:09:59] it's like it start up your car and you
[1:10:01] have no gas but those that were wise
[1:10:04] have a car but they fill it up with gas
[1:10:08] and they a lot of people sit along in
[1:10:11] message churches and they think they're
[1:10:12] wise virgin we couldn't understand this
[1:10:15] mystery of the oil and this is the key
[1:10:18] of the matters but always said let's
[1:10:20] keep the main thing the main thing how
[1:10:23] books have tips have revelation have
[1:10:25] understanding of the scripture didn't
[1:10:27] know what the expectation didn't know
[1:10:29] about Rome didn't know about the plagues
[1:10:31] then normal defiles first will second
[1:10:33] but simple they have all these great
[1:10:35] knowledge and mysteries and revelations
[1:10:39] but you know what there are many Bible
[1:10:41] scholars who know all this stuff too
[1:10:45] but oil in the lamp oil in the lamp but
[1:10:51] a Branham taught us the oil represents
[1:10:52] the Holy Spirit the oil is in the church
[1:10:55] he always had a movement
[1:10:56] he always had a belief the oil isn't
[1:10:59] under a pastor that's turn the oil the
[1:11:01] oil is the Holy Ghost and it has to be
[1:11:04] in something can the church say Amen so
[1:11:07] they're different between the wise and
[1:11:08] the foolish was not what church you go
[1:11:10] into not who your pasta is not what
[1:11:13] teams you play in church and if you're
[1:11:15] playing tapes in the children and who is
[1:11:17] preaching and who is not preaching and
[1:11:19] if it's live or if it's not live or how
[1:11:22] long in the message or how long in
[1:11:24] church and what do you believe in it you
[1:11:26] really love God that's the toil
[1:11:30] how many quotes you read there's only
[1:11:33] one difference the wise had oil and the
[1:11:36] foolish had no oil every Sunday people
[1:11:39] sit in church and in that church is wise
[1:11:42] and foolish because what separates our
[1:11:45] wives from the foolish is the wise are
[1:11:47] putting things in place by ensuring that
[1:11:50] they have oil in their lamps they do a
[1:11:52] little more they did a little extra
[1:11:54] they're getting ready they get them
[1:11:56] prepared they don't know when they don't
[1:11:57] know how they don't know why but they
[1:11:58] get already somebody say man but I ran
[1:12:01] to the extra oil is the difference he
[1:12:04] said the difference is too token the
[1:12:06] token is a life it's a virtue sits at
[1:12:08] unless it's voices it's charity because
[1:12:10] only the life could be received by the
[1:12:12] groom can the church hymn and making
[1:12:18] preparations for the coming of the Lord
[1:12:21] it's not reading books that's on the
[1:12:24] preparations he's adding oil hallelujah
[1:12:29] hallelujah hallelujah I said it some
[1:12:32] time ago I said go auto just for Mary
[1:12:34] teeth on the wood day and night to
[1:12:37] meditate on something you have to know
[1:12:39] it before I can meditate on it so
[1:12:41] reading the wood it will really Bradley
[1:12:44] Bible like is it newspaper you know but
[1:12:47] after you read it you meditate on it you
[1:12:50] read the prophet message and you know
[1:12:51] your meditate on what you read how is
[1:12:54] this helping me how is this applied to
[1:12:55] my life what do I need to change Lord I
[1:12:57] want to be more like you
[1:12:58] you're going to pray a DM naked thinking
[1:13:00] you're here sermon tonight Lord I want
[1:13:03] the extra oil I want to have too much I
[1:13:05] would have eat I want to have so much
[1:13:06] island I don't risk I don't want to be
[1:13:08] at risk and it's doing a convent I want
[1:13:10] to have everything I don't want to
[1:13:12] believe somebody would I want to believe
[1:13:14] only what so open no I have my unbelief
[1:13:16] take away the top perform surgery
[1:13:18] tonight in my heart I don't want to
[1:13:20] measure it by my ruler I want your ruler
[1:13:23] Lord can the church say manases is this
[1:13:26] helping anybody tonight it's a reality
[1:13:28] in your workplace it's a reality in your
[1:13:31] house is a reality if nobody else wants
[1:13:33] it you want the extra oil can the church
[1:13:36] say man but a Branham in the token he
[1:13:40] said the differently life and death was
[1:13:42] a token which are my life and death now
[1:13:45] you know because with all these plagues
[1:13:47] come he said touch not my anointed touch
[1:13:51] that anyway the seal of God it ever was
[1:13:54] a time to make sure you have oil it's
[1:13:56] know if there ever was a time to make
[1:13:59] sure that your walk is right with God
[1:14:01] it's know if there ever was a time to
[1:14:04] put the skills of life and where your
[1:14:06] life against the word is know and see if
[1:14:09] you come up wanting hallelujah
[1:14:12] hallelujah and so will it be at the
[1:14:16] coming of the Son of God when he brings
[1:14:18] the bride out of the church heard what
[1:14:20] he said
[1:14:21] bride out of the church people believe
[1:14:25] that sitting in a message church means
[1:14:27] you are bride there's nothing to support
[1:14:29] that don't let any minister confuse you
[1:14:33] attendance in church doesn't equal pride
[1:14:39] people have put their faith in men faith
[1:14:41] and systems fit in Church have hid in
[1:14:46] court
[1:14:48] have faith in coat you must have the
[1:14:51] token personally displayed hallelujah
[1:14:57] but a bad sense now listen close this
[1:15:00] evening and see that isn't a token would
[1:15:02] be the difference there has got to be a
[1:15:05] difference so the only difference
[1:15:07] between the bride between the wise and
[1:15:10] the foolish would be the token you can
[1:15:12] have all the knowledge that's not the
[1:15:15] difference
[1:15:16] God is not comparing knowledge against
[1:15:18] knowledge your understanding of the
[1:15:20] sixth seal and the seventh seal endure
[1:15:22] the wars and the plays and the vials and
[1:15:24] the woman when God says the day I'm
[1:15:27] looking for the difference he said
[1:15:29] where's the oil somebody could come into
[1:15:32] the message for a war month and have oil
[1:15:34] somebody for 30 years and have look at
[1:15:39] the century and he didn't grow up under
[1:15:41] the church even grew up in the temple
[1:15:43] but when he came with a knee to Jesus in
[1:15:45] all of Israel I haven't seen Fiat like
[1:15:47] this under semi Cayenne Obadiah and you
[1:15:51] sat on the temple for forty years and he
[1:15:53] have no fear this Centurion has more
[1:15:55] feet in Luther's day the extra oil the
[1:16:04] difference the token of his day was the
[1:16:07] just shall live by feet those who broke
[1:16:10] out of what they were in and accepted
[1:16:13] that message apply the token for the ID
[1:16:16] they did the extra for deity they
[1:16:19] invested what it took that needed to be
[1:16:21] invested to reflect what was required
[1:16:23] for that day they will prepare to meet
[1:16:25] the challenge of the oil for that day
[1:16:28] they had the extraordinary seeming but
[1:16:33] Abraham thought it was the same hole he
[1:16:34] goes in every age so Luther had enough
[1:16:37] of the Holy Ghost for justification then
[1:16:40] Wesley had word luta had passed some
[1:16:42] more there was a new difference because
[1:16:45] the season change so you couldn't go
[1:16:47] over to measure that you had from
[1:16:49] looters D into a CD you have to have
[1:16:51] more
[1:16:53] can the church say man the Lutheran's
[1:16:56] Wesley's message became the extra
[1:17:00] Wesley's message required more
[1:17:02] preparation more revelation a greater
[1:17:06] experience you have to know get the oil
[1:17:09] to meet the requirement because we're at
[1:17:12] brendham talk--i there was a blending in
[1:17:14] justice when John was there and Jesus
[1:17:16] was there there was a shift John is
[1:17:19] still preaching but those who saw Jesus
[1:17:21] started to follow Jesus and they were
[1:17:24] those who were still under John's
[1:17:25] ministry not realizing that the season
[1:17:28] had changed in so much so when Paul in
[1:17:35] acts 19 goes about he says unto what
[1:17:38] were you baptized hunter John's baptism
[1:17:42] because John didn't stop baptizing when
[1:17:44] Jesus came on the scene Jesus was
[1:17:46] baptized and he went on in his ministry
[1:17:48] was coming into view and and John said I
[1:17:51] must decrease so that his ministry could
[1:17:53] increase and so it was Luther is fading
[1:17:56] away and then Wesley's message slipping
[1:17:59] in and extra oil there were those who
[1:18:03] had whole long to looters teaching but
[1:18:05] this is all we know this is all we have
[1:18:07] this is how it's been this is what
[1:18:09] Luther told us but there was oil that
[1:18:14] have to be put into lamps to meet the
[1:18:16] requirements of the age are you with me
[1:18:18] as we was one watch but around you as
[1:18:22] one watch feed into the next watch those
[1:18:27] that were all right in Luther's age had
[1:18:29] to make a choice to accept or reject the
[1:18:32] extra that Wesley brought it required a
[1:18:35] new level of preparation a new level of
[1:18:38] dedication it required a new level of
[1:18:40] sanctification because his message was
[1:18:42] one of sanctification the believers who
[1:18:46] will Luther search and understand the
[1:18:48] sanctification thing but know you have
[1:18:50] to be more ready more prepared more
[1:18:52] dedicated more consecrated more so loud
[1:18:56] you have to give up more things because
[1:18:57] there was no oil required can the church
[1:18:59] same and anybody with me tonight
[1:19:03] I'm almost finished then the Pentecostal
[1:19:06] scheme and the gifts were restored and
[1:19:08] tongues and these things it was more
[1:19:11] extra another level
[1:19:13] another requirement another level of
[1:19:16] preparation another level of dedication
[1:19:18] and it's a blending in and in the height
[1:19:21] of the Pentecostals as their eye
[1:19:23] exploding here comes a little profit
[1:19:27] brings the food the full light every
[1:19:32] mystery revealed and in the fullness of
[1:19:35] the world now requires a fullness of
[1:19:36] dedication a fullness of surrender a
[1:19:39] fullness of the spirit of match the
[1:19:42] fullness of the word because when a
[1:19:44] Branham taught that from that first age
[1:19:46] until the prophetic age told the
[1:19:48] conductor the wood had been lost and the
[1:19:51] power that should have been floor into
[1:19:53] the church couldn't Florida way it was
[1:19:54] supposed to but when it's little 20th
[1:19:57] century Kentucky prophet began to preach
[1:19:59] here see the discrepancy serpent see the
[1:20:02] citizen ear with the shocker adoption
[1:20:05] begin to pull these little things
[1:20:06] together and slowly slowly under the
[1:20:09] devil's eyes and everything else how
[1:20:10] much is going on he was gathering here
[1:20:12] from Genesis from Revelation pulling the
[1:20:15] pieces together trying to catch the
[1:20:17] attention of four people catch the
[1:20:22] attention of virgins as it were but
[1:20:25] within their wise and foolish there were
[1:20:28] those who see the man who see the gifts
[1:20:30] who see what he performed and those who
[1:20:32] are listen to the words
[1:20:33] because I recognize is not even by the
[1:20:35] Branham he's pointing to Jesus it's
[1:20:39] about Jesus Malachi 4 and she used to
[1:20:43] talk on the life of Jesus Christ once to
[1:20:45] 25 others five musicians no get ready
[1:20:47] while the bridegroom tarried they all
[1:20:50] slumbered and slept while God has been
[1:20:53] preparing because the bridegroom went to
[1:20:55] prepare with Alma making preparations
[1:20:57] for the coming of the Lord while
[1:20:58] quarters preparing they all slumbered
[1:21:00] and slept two different words
[1:21:02] slumber and slept and not the same
[1:21:06] wherever I'm type it out SEP fall asleep
[1:21:09] slumber waiting almost dozing as it were
[1:21:12] different
[1:21:14] sleepin already did but abandoned
[1:21:17] brother tapped the bride from the Seven
[1:21:18] Cities are sleeping but slumber means
[1:21:21] dormant inactive not moving waiting for
[1:21:23] something so it must mean the living
[1:21:25] bride is slumbering slumbering in the
[1:21:29] message with books and tips slumbering
[1:21:32] in the message with the power because
[1:21:34] the word is power no wonder that
[1:21:37] prophecy it takes something to to give
[1:21:39] the bride seat sorry to wake up someone
[1:21:42] is still into action can the church say
[1:21:45] man
[1:21:45] o the telling Christ suppose arise we
[1:21:48] who are alive we who are slumbering
[1:21:50] that's why but it Branham said and
[1:21:51] people fight this cord the bride has
[1:21:53] done had a revival yet she has been no
[1:21:56] revival there no manifestation of God
[1:21:58] stir the bride we are looking for it
[1:22:01] it'll take those seven unknown turn this
[1:22:03] back there to wake her up again he will
[1:22:06] send it he promised it I'm under
[1:22:08] expectation for it I'm making
[1:22:10] preparations for it I'm almost finished
[1:22:13] in other words a manifestation of behold
[1:22:16] the bridegroom cometh will be seven
[1:22:18] thunders uttering their voices I'm

[1:26:02] with this word because her you handless
[1:26:05] what is a measure of your character and
[1:26:07] your understanding of the need to be
[1:26:09] prepared can the church say Amen trim
[1:26:14] the excess all the virgins so listen
[1:26:17] carefully wise and foolish trim an
[1:26:20] accessor it's coming up to a close race
[1:26:24] I'm almost finished
[1:26:26] Oh all the footage in the road but
[1:26:29] occurence all trim their lamps all cut
[1:26:34] off things from the world all trim the
[1:26:36] excess oil making an effort it's a real
[1:26:39] effort in not playing Church they want
[1:26:43] to be right and look around the land and
[1:26:44] their people who love God they love the
[1:26:47] message and love the word doing the best
[1:26:49] he could but that's not the question is
[1:26:52] there oil in your lamp and it's after
[1:26:56] the trimming it's only after the
[1:26:59] trimming the question comes the foolish
[1:27:02] said to the wise give us of your oil
[1:27:04] because in the act of trimming in the
[1:27:07] act of cutting away what should not be
[1:27:09] there it allows you to look back at your
[1:27:12] life and reconsider have I done all I
[1:27:15] should do to make this rupture have I
[1:27:18] done everything I should do to make this
[1:27:20] cut and in cotton you realize there's
[1:27:22] only then when you take time to look in
[1:27:25] the mirror of the word and inside to
[1:27:27] realize I'm short of something I'm Maria
[1:27:31] I'm missing something after 30 years in
[1:27:34] a message I have knowledge but have no
[1:27:37] oil of information but no oils I have
[1:27:42] revelation but no oil
[1:27:44] and no mysteries and I don't have oil
[1:27:46] and no history and I have no oil I know
[1:27:51] where God brought us from but I have no
[1:27:53] oil and no bride history but I have no
[1:27:57] oil I'm living right but I've trimmed
[1:28:03] and I have no oil I have a desire to
[1:28:05] serve God but I have no oil but the band
[1:28:07] said he shakes at the D way young people
[1:28:09] come to the altar and they pray but
[1:28:11] across the line in other words it's too
[1:28:12] late no salvation left for them because
[1:28:16] the cry has gone out there's no more
[1:28:18] time to prepare the foolish said to the
[1:28:22] wise give us of your oil for our lamps
[1:28:24] are worn out what little they had listen
[1:28:28] carefully they had something but it
[1:28:30] didn't have enough because what they had
[1:28:33] went out so it's not that they didn't
[1:28:35] have or they never had something you
[1:28:37] know they didn't have enough have you
[1:28:41] done enough
[1:28:41] but the PanAm scream that have I done
[1:28:44] enough have you done enough have we done
[1:28:46] enough but the wise answered saying not
[1:28:51] so lest there be not enough the issue
[1:28:55] becomes enough for us and for you but
[1:28:58] going rather to them that sell and buy
[1:29:01] for yourself and why they want to buy
[1:29:04] what is painful because this shows
[1:29:07] friends the desire to do right this is
[1:29:12] not these people want to go into the
[1:29:13] world they're not trying to go and drink
[1:29:15] and smoke and party they're looking now
[1:29:17] for oil but it's actually too late they
[1:29:21] no catch a revelation of what they
[1:29:23] should have been doing all along except
[1:29:26] that they caught the revelation to lead
[1:29:27] because they were comfortable being
[1:29:29] virgins comfortable having what they
[1:29:32] thought was enough and not realizing
[1:29:34] that there was more preparation that was
[1:29:36] required and that this preparation
[1:29:39] should have been happening but was not
[1:29:41] happening maybe they were too busy maybe
[1:29:46] they were too busy I'm challenging us
[1:29:49] I'm challenging me I'm telling you
[1:29:50] tonight
[1:29:53] well they went to buy the bridegroom
[1:29:55] came and V the
[1:29:57] already went in are you ready tonight
[1:30:02] went with him to the marriage and the
[1:30:05] door was shut did that already be that
[1:30:09] already and afterward came all to the
[1:30:14] other virgins in Lord Lord open to us
[1:30:18] but he answered and said verily I say
[1:30:20] unto you I know you not all your years
[1:30:23] in the message and the peer you get for
[1:30:27] it is I know you not because you did not
[1:30:29] pass the exam that was required what's
[1:30:34] there for watch therefore is a this is a
[1:30:37] warning now about being vigilant about
[1:30:41] being on point about being ready about
[1:30:44] not ever getting slack about not ever
[1:30:46] getting comfortable watch therefore for
[1:30:48] you know neither the day nor the hour
[1:30:50] wherein the Son of man cometh foolish
[1:30:55] virgin
[1:30:55] those that truly believe that they have
[1:30:58] what it takes
[1:30:59] they believe that they're going to make
[1:31:01] it but when the call goes out they
[1:31:03] realize they don't have enough they had
[1:31:06] all they had something but it did not
[1:31:08] have extra they had experiences they may
[1:31:11] have had a booth they may have spoken in
[1:31:13] tongues they had oil but they did not
[1:31:15] have extra they had a small measure but
[1:31:19] the mystery filling of what was worked
[1:31:21] in a small measure can the church say
[1:31:25] man I'm finished in the breach between
[1:31:27] the seven church ages and the seven
[1:31:29] seals but about him said for the trumpet
[1:31:31] of God shall sound at the last trumpet
[1:31:33] and when this last scene is broke and
[1:31:36] when the seven angel giving his message
[1:31:38] the last trumpet shall sound and the
[1:31:39] dead in Christ shall rise and we which
[1:31:41] are alive and remain shall be caught up
[1:31:44] together with them to meet him in the
[1:31:46] air
