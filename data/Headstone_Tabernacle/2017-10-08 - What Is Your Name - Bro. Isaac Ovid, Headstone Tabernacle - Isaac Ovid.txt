[Music] Oh blessed be a name let's just bow our heads for the word of Prayer Heavenly Father we are so grateful this morning to be in your presence to be under the canopy of life Lord there's no place that will rather be as the psalmist David said I was glad when they said unto me let us go into the house of the Lord father we thank you for bringing us to this spot and we thank you for your grace and your mercy towards us as we look back through our lives as we look back through the years through the months through the weeks Lord we come to the great realization that we could not have done it on our own Lord our own strength of our own ability has failed us many times but you have never filled us Lord and we thank you for preserving our lives that father we can give you worship and praise as we were born to do and to prove to the devil in such a time exists that we will not be like Eve we will not be received but we have received your prophet we have received your word and it has kept us alive we have our up days and we have our down days but we are alive we have our good moments and our bad moments but we are alive father Lord your prophets said Lord one slow we are neither far the Lord is a purpose for a live Lord because when a man is done you take him off the scene so we are here this morning because of our purpose is not yet accomplished our purpose is not yet fulfilled and even though we are up and down sometimes we come to surrender our lives to your purpose we come to surrender our lives to your will Lord me you have the preeminence this morning lovely you bless the reading of the word me you bless the hearing of the word me you bring a great deliverance to your people all we want to remember sister Christine and a family in the Cherno are not well that you would heal them in a special way you would touch them it is anyone sick in the building this morning me you touch them is there anyone who is not here in the house for whatever reason may you touch them it is a backslider the houses spawning father me your handle Lord grip the sword and cut through it find what's not right and cut it out me you perform spiritual surgery this Smalley may you search the camp because you promised the church without spot you promised the church without wrinkle you promised a church where the power of God could move freely where the sick cannot stay sickened that there cannot stand their father lift us up where we belong me you take me out of the way and speak directly to your people Lord take away my thoughts my ideas and Lord me the Holy Ghost minister Lord even to me this morning we pray a special blessing on our pastor this morning Lord that he will touch him Lord in his body lomi give him a good rest and look at him strengthen unction to continue to battle me you bless his wife also lorry labor in the pulpit last week the week before three services love me you touch him in a special way we commit the service into your hands and the church says amen and amen and amen you may be seated just for a few greetings before I get to the message this morning so you happen to be in the house of the Lord today amen we'd like to welcome Saleem Jack invited by brother Barry where is Jack okay god bless you welcome to headstone tabernacle and we also have a note of praise from mother Mondays I like to thank God for the praise of the scenes I am back on my feet god bless you were the mothers [Applause] [Music] then a men a many many men you know and but the random said that to have a victory that must be a battle so to have a victorious life you must have a life as full of methyls and I'm more convinced than ever that the devil has a job to do so we ought not to be upset when he does his job but commensurate or in parallel with his job we also have a job to do and our job is to make his job harder and to overcome our job is to make him look like he's doing nothing and to win and his job because our story is already written the conclusion of his story is also written and the conclusion of our story is also written can the church say Amen amen so I bring greetings this morning in the precious name of Jesus Christ firstly from the believers in South Africa from Durban from Johannesburg from believe Cape Town's SATA hime and different IRA's in South Africa we were in a tremendous youth meeting in Dillon and the Lord really blessed I think it was on Sunday morning close to maybe around 500 or so people were there and it was really really a tremendous time I was able to speak us on the mornings on the evening then when the meeting was over and Tuesday night I spoke about a blessed Church and all over the world the Spirit is moving we men to the believers send their greetings but the players sense is greetings and the family matured with a Rhema Thompson family and church and the ministers over there and then I slipped over to Germany and last Sunday I spoke about the coulomb Rhenish which in Germany so where the : Rena sends his greetings his family and the church as well and it's certainly good to be back home and I was really blessed to hear the worship and the singing and the anointing and the atmosphere because that is what makes the difference is the anointing that makes a difference and I believe in my heart as brother Branham taught us the minister could never bring the revival there's no man of the hour who is pouring out and carrying out a revival it is still up to the people God you remove that privilege from men and please sit on the people so that you could call upon him whenever you have need and get a response and God loves that because he is a part of the audience he's a God who loves fellowship he's a God who loves relationship when he was there by himself he felt lonely he was not satisfied just to be there by himself and when he got the angels he still was not satisfied because he couldn't relate about your struggles he can relate because the angels had no struggles he angels have no trials but but when man came and man felt for the first time he could hear how rough your day was and how and what what trouble you had and he could extend himself and display his attributes ooh so God loves fellowship and and he loves when you call upon his name he loves it when we worship he loves it when we lift our hands and and when the ground said we defy gravity we defy the laws of nature when we bring pass our Normand and do something different I mean I'm a big believer in doing something different I'm a big believer in doing the unexpected I'm a big believer in breaking the routine so I said to the people if you are custom raising one hands raise both hands if you never raise both hands on one foot before tries out today I don't think Alda you saw me if you'll never raise board hands at one foot before it sounds crazy but doing something that's unexpected the devil dunno if you're coming if you're going if you're happy or you're sad you're in the middle of your trial was in the house of God and the devil is in trouble because you are here he tried to keep you out of home he you tried to tell you this is not working out he he tried to tell you there you're not gonna make it he tried to tell you to throw in the towel he tried to tell you to give up but something kept holding me holding on to me and he's not gonna let me go he's not gonna let you go because he knows your name he knows your every thought he knows who you are better than you know yourself blessed be the name of the Lord Oh hallelujah so are you ready for the word this morning are you excited about the Lord did you come to church this morning to spend the day in the presence of the Lord you forget about the bills you forget about the work you forget about tomorrow Bobby says take note thoughts even the Apostles didn't even think about what had to say because the spirit moved one of these days listen there'll be no more work no more house no more mortgage let's practice how that's gonna be today no more plaque me let's get let's try it out this morning oh then I have a care in this world to not have a stress or a child or worry about the budget or the price of diesel doesn't have nothing to do with it we come from an eternal Kingdom we perform any time our place we turn up when we need to move we can move like that faster than a plane faster than a rocket translation tape what didn't you see me next without world that's what in until it is made diesel come back to me this morning Oh what was on the inside expressed itself on the outside and one of these days this word that you have been worshipping this word you've been feasting on will transform itself from on the inside into these 16 elements Oh give the Lord a hand of praise give the Lord a shout of praise that's only 5% give the Lord a shout of praise that's 45% give the Lord a shout of praise the Bible says he inhabits the praise of his people and I was praises his house praises his house he lives in the praise so when you praise you are creating a place for him to live he inhabits the praises of everybody what of his people he inhabits the praises of his people and his people are born to praise his people are born to worship his people know who he is Jesus saw the woman at the well the hour cometh and now is for the true worshipers the use of the word true would indicate that they are also false worshipers there are people who worship because it's what they're supposed to do that's not what I'm talking about the true worshipers worship from their belly their worship from all that's within them when I have money or don't have money he still deserves the worship when I woke up on the good side of the bed or the bad side of the bed he still deserves worship whether he can do what I asked for he didn't give me what I wanted he still deserves or ship what I've been in church for 40 years for one day he still deserves the worship because he has halfa years Omega he is the beginning is the end is the Rose of Sharon his name is wonderful he has pounced about he is Prince of Peace of he is your shield he is your reward he is your buckle up he is the shoe brand what you think about Jesus he's alright I don't know what's gonna happen this mornin but we came to lift heaven high and here the devil town I don't know about you but I can't wait to put my foot on the devil for a long time he pulled through your house and it's time to put your foot we've seen it the devil try to take carpet among us but you know what he still standing his time is not yet just like job you can touch what you want but don't touch his life didn't touch the car but don't touch his life because his purpose is not yet done but when it is over you're gonna get trouble for your trouble you're gonna get all you had a ball because that's your promise you are chosen of God you are called of God you are hallelujah Oh see that only smaller before we leave this place everybody gotta be on fire that's my mission this morning we're not leaving one behind we're not leaving you in Egypt we are not leaving you in Egypt there's a promised land to be taken we are telling Pharaoh let my people go so let's turn to our feet Thank You musicians thank you for the anthony if you have your bibles will you turn with me to two portions of scripture reading from the book of Genesis and the book of Revelation as the Prophet said there are two books in the Bible the devil hits so we are being very very deliberate this morning the devil hits the book of Genesis he it's the book of Revelation so we gonna take him on both sides this morning from the book of Genesis and to the book of Revelation Genesis 32 and reading verse 24 and Bible says and Jacob was left alone is that wonderful to be left alone away from your co-workers away from the church away from the believers left alone you and your thoughts you and your identity you and your mission you and your purpose you and God and Jacob was left alone and they wrestled a man with him until the breaking of the D and when he saw that he prevailed not against him he touched the hollow of his thigh and the hollow of Jacob's thigh was out of joint as he wrestled with him and he said let me go this is the angel speaking for the day bring it and he said Jacob said I will not let me go except thou bless me and he said unto Him what is thy name and he said Jacob then he said and he said thy name shall be called no more Jacob but Israel for as a prince has thou power with God and with men and hast revealed reading revelation chapter 2 and reading verse 17 revelation 217 and it says here he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches to him that overcometh will I give to eat of the hidden manna and will give him a white stone and in the stone a new name written which no man knoweth save he that receiveth it made a lot of a blessing to the reading of his word you may be seated this morning so I have a title this morning what is your name what is your name a subject the unfolding of the bride and an inspiration the mystery of who you are what is your name reading throughout the Bible starting from the book of Genesis just want to read this or two there in the beginning God created we know it's and God said let there be light going on to verse three and down to verse five it's the first time the process of a meme comes into play I'm going all the light D so the light was given a name and the darkness he called night so way back one of the first acts that God did was meme to name something and one of Adam's purposes so the purpose that Adam had in the beginning was to name the animals now a name can apply to animate as well as in animate objects so a human has a name an animal could have a name this has a name if I say chair something comes to your mind because it has a name names have three main purposes on the one hand a name is used to identify so I could walk up to brother George and say that is brother Terrence so the name identifies him so if you meet somebody for the first time that is who he is so the name can be used to identify a name can be used to refer so I could go out to buy the George and say by the George did you hear however the Terence was worshipping so the name now refers to him it's time identifying him he's already identified because he knows who he is know I could refer to him I can't refer to him unless he knows his name are you with me so a name can be used to identify a name can be used to refer and a name can also be used to address so I can say brother Terrence how is your walk with the Lord by calling for the Terrence I don't expect brother Mikey to answer because I was addressing him and throughout scripture we see these encounters and that's why I act with a tree to sing that song he knows my name [Applause] naming is powerful because a name is not just by what you are call and their different ways because the name also represents something so in different cultures around the world taking Africa for example when a child is born the father would walk around and meditate and look at the Stars and look at the child and we take a couple of days most times we have what's called a naming ceremony because the name you give to the child has significance it has it has meaning that's in the natural if you call it in a natural in the spiritual and the Bible and the Prophet speaks about it when those Ebru mother's give birth in birth pains they call the name I'm not even Joshua led by the spirit to change the policeman that their names place them in the promised land so names have great meaning what is your name [Music] go through the scripture God meets Abram we call him Abraham but when God met him his name was Abraham but God knew his name and we read this scripture from which the tackle is taken this morning of this man called Jacob but the Branham refers to him quite a bit and his story is known I would expect by almost everyone Jacob the deceiver Jacob the liar Jacob the scamp Jacob the cheetah they call him Hawkins stuff and when it came time for the butch right his mother was complicit she was very much the hands was in the cookie jar because she loved this boy called Jacob and even God said from from before they were even here Jacob I love and Esau I hate it so there was something about this man Kim called Jacob all was not well with him but he was still loved by God but in growing up the Bible says one time Esau was out hunting and around that time is when the father Isaac was about to pronounce the blessing and when you got time you could go through it and during that time the mother saying you can go and get the blessing the Bible says that Jacob put on skin because his brother was hairy so he covered himself up so he could appear like his brother because he wanted the birthright but by custom the boots right would only go to the firstborn and Jacob was not the firstborn there were twins in their mother's womb but Esau was the fortunate one to come out first so Jacob didn't stand a chance but he was desperate to get this thing called the birthright it was a by any means necessary kind of things for him so but to jump to this spot after all and had been done it so happened and Isaac blessed him and the bush right went to Jacob and Jacob would have felt good because the blessings that Jacob pronounced could not have even been taken back the blessing that I said pronounced upon Jacob was it was spoken he couldn't even undo it and say I made a mistake it was supposed to be Esau here but I blessed Jacob Jacob got the word blessing and that covenant could not even be broken as I couldn't gonna say I made a missing and bless the wrong one the moment it was spoken and uttered the word took an effect upon Jacob's life and in his deceiving backslidden campus condition the words started to operate upon Zeke there was no undo button you may be seated for a minute you know how in Microsoft Word and Excel and these things you could undo there was no undo because when Isaac was blessing he was blessing peace and the law of God my word kind of returns void when I speak when I speak is got to happen so this is an encouragement to us even if you are here by mistake because Jacob was there by mistake even if you are here by mistake once the one step speak into your life [Applause] [Music] and the church say Amen everybody with me this morning [Applause] so Jacob is walking with the blessing and he's feeling good about himself his flocks are growing his his family is growing and then Esau just gets upset he said this thing not right and Jacob heard wood that Esau was coming to be with him the Bible says were the sheen that Jacobs has the same family this way sin flux this way you say you know what you go this way until everybody else had left him and as the Scripture we read Jacob was left on who and that's the problem with many of us in our Christian walk because God doesn't judge us in a group we hear it all the time it's an individual of fear it's between you and God your testimony is more valuable to God when you are alone your testimony listen in this environment but the Nepean is normally no it's not exceptional because you're supposed to put your hand up here but when you put your hands up in your house by yourself now that's exceptional there people say they have a test for trial with his brother with his sister in a church that's not no test because you're still in an environment where a certain level of behavior is expected but it's when you're not in the environment to be expected and you're on your job and there are no brethren to audit your behavior the pastor is not been the ELA is not there the minister is not there to put pressure you know the some young you'll see on the back one the back I don't know how to under fight that many times getting scared on the back home there's nobody to hold it back because you are left alone and in that moment when you are alone God could really deal with you and it comes down to the choice you make when you are alone - the Bible says dad Jacob was left alone and he wrestled all night the Battle of all night was based on the fact that he was afraid he was desperate he didn't want to meet he saw in the condition that he was in he couldn't afford to me he saw in the condition that he was into the Bible says he wrestled all night and what you'd understand he wasn't wrestling with mortal man he was wrestling with an angel you could tackle angels Jacob a normal man put so much pressure on angel he is at the back to go Jacob's desperation his desire his planning to be transformed was so great the angel at the actual mission and Jacob was so determined he gave the angel conditions is that I will not let you go until you bless me if we have to stay for a week we are moving but I'm not letting you call until [Applause] what will happen to the church if everybody comes to children's in Lourdes I'm not leaving here until you bless me I'm not letting you go I'll tell my son is delivered I'm not letting you go until I am delivered I'm not letting you go until I am healed he may be seated don't remember the Prophet give the story when they asked about the Holy Ghost and I said Lord if you don't fill me you're gonna find my bones right here that's the same quality of spirit that it takes to get the results and the church say man everybody feeling fine we're talking him on your name this morning the problem with Jacob is he did not know his name he thought he knew his name because your knowledge is limited by your past unless you are prophet to see in the future or like the prophets about back into the past your knowledge is limited to your existence think about it it's not like the angel didn't know who you was fighting but he asked him what is your name and the Bible says Jacob saying I'm Jacob and the angel his response was that's not your name [Music] what's happening here God saw it before there was a moon before there was a star this moment in time this battle has taken place this is not a surprise to God but this is the lecture even if your name is not Jacob your name is not a deceiver your name is not a scam your name is not a cheater you are Prince of course your name is Israel that is your name another preacher seal one time when Esau would ever meet Jacob and say you did this you did that you did that the man who was called Jacob is now Israel see that wasn't me my name is Israel if you're looking for Jacob go and look somewhere else for living that's not my name my name is Israel and we have many believers in the church who need to come to an understanding of who they are because they are walking around after years and the message saying my name is Jacob my name is Jacob and I'm here to let you know your name is not Jacob because you are born to overcome and to him that overcome when I grant undo name and your name identifies your characteristics your name speaks to your attributes your name speaks to what you could do your name speaks to your authority [Applause] you may be seated I'm laying a background for something what is your name the Bible says in Hebrews 11 by faith Noah by faith Abraham and you go down and you reach to Moses and the very story of Moses is by faith because the parents had to have feet that take Moses and put him in an aisle that was used to killing babies but they had to feet and they launched Moses out there the Bible says that Moses was trained in all that Egypt had but the Bible says by faith Moses refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter to refuse to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter men that Moses had a revelation that that's not my name now it's deeper than that friends because when you study the scripture think about it at that time your name was your power open the house in the name of the king as the son of Pharaoh's daughter it made Moses eligible for the throne but that temptation of power did not move him he said that's not my name as the son of Pharaoh's daughter he was entitled to the red carpet but the babies that he refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter he said that's not my name when Moses walking around I said what's your name isn't that Moses that's not my name God give us some believers who will walk around and say what you calling me that's not my name Moses was offered the throne of Egypt the riches of Egypt the power of Egypt but that's not my name my name is different my name has a different power and the devil will give you all kinds of names it's time you start to declare that's not my name depression is not your name sickness not your name that's not your name unbeliever that's not your name make believer that's not your name true believer that's me overcome that's me victorious that's me church member that's not my name a non-believer that's not my name into the All Tomorrow's that's not my name bride of Jesus Christ that's my name what is your name what is your name who are you and the church say man you may be seated can we give the Lord a hand the praise so that's my little introduction this morning I love it when the bag was speaking about Jesus to come that I said and his name will be wonderful and he will be called counsel draw the whole Bible he was speaking about this name that was higher than every other name in so much in the name of Jesus demons are cast out in the name of Jesus every knee has the pot every tongue must confess that he is Lord that's the power of her name to this day when you hear certain names it creates certain thoughts history when you hear Hitler it means something when into another here Eric William it means something and that's just the name most people have not met Eric Williams but just the name creates a certain feeling that's how Jesus is and the name we said we introduced it a name could identify a name could refer and I name could address what did the Prophet say he said when you talk about him he comes near [Applause] so for most people the he has been identified when he's on a reefer is a bit closer because you can identify that's the president you can refer to him that's somewhat more because you refer to him but then when you address him that's the direct relationship mr. president can I have this can I have that and what we need to do in our Christian journey is move from him being identified to sing I want to be like Jesus to refer into Jesus he's a healer he's a savior that's wonderful but he want to reach the point we could have a conversation women said Jesus I love you Jesus I worship you the name above all other names counselor Prince of Peace Rose of Sharon lily of the valley that his name that's who he is that's his behavior that's his being that's his attributes and if we are to be bride of Jesus Christ it must also mean that our name and what we are call must also have attributes it must be that you are called overcomer it must be that you are victorious it must be can the church same [Applause] the mystery of who you are whatever the random say the Prophet said the names in the book is not the literal name he said it's not all my Nevel it's not leave him he said it's the mystery of who you are and when you read the Bible the Bible we preached before is a book of names but anybody looking at it didn't know what it was because it was a mystery to them that's why I'm speaking about the mystery of who you are so for years the scripture was there virgin shall conceive but if Ellen said scripture is mystery mystery of Scripture but it's also a name and for yes that name was there waiting for the person to be called that name so when Mary is walking to get some water that scripture is her name she doesn't know it yet until an angel comes to meet her and say Hail Mary tower highly favored a woman I'm an angel brought her name to her that angel called her name from in the book and identified that virgin will conceive that's you that is your name if I call you Mary but when God looks at you you are the virgin that will conceive and bring forth a son that's your name that's who you are oh you don't hear me this morning anybody in the house is smaller suppose this is born they seem Moses who refuse to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter he didn't know his purpose he just knew that while he was in Egypt he didn't feel comfortable the pilot said he rejected the riches of Egypt to be like the mud of us as the Prophet call him he rejected the offer that they had for him because something in him was different he was trying to solve her his identity crisis of he knew that was not his name but he didn't know what his name was he knew he was not from the world but he needed to know Who am I he knew that he was not caused a drink and a smoke and to commit fornication and to commit adultery and to be a good Methodist and a strong Baptist and a tongue weekend Pentecostal he knew he was still exact but they had to come a point to Moses to hear Who am I anybody in the house this morning anybody in the house this morning supposes he refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter and that's a first step I'm not of this world I might be in the world but I'm not of this world this one is not my home I don't know who I am yet but with a Branham said one name the bride will get to know who she is and when that happens then the rapture will go so we know we are not from the world we are not familiaris here we are not from this time we are from the empty we are from eternity we come from God we go back to court [Applause] or somebody get on a sauna praise hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah we didn't read it but when Jacob for the angel brother Anthony and interlock shake up what is your name said she could be said you'll be no longer called chica because Israel Jacob as he enter what is your name and the Bible says the angel didn't response he said oh you don't need to know my name but look at Moses Moses he runs away from Egypt he refused to eat he could have stayed and been on a nice throne in a nice kind a nice house and the battery knew all the science he knew all the religious you know order the philosophy and the history and he had all the degrees this was dr. Moses this was Prince Moses and and he rejected that he could have been well - he rejected that he could have been whatever you wanted the people he rejected that his name in Egypt gave him access listen carefully his name in Egypt gave him access to the wealth of Egypt his name in Egypt give him access to opportunities in Egypt strive for access and opportunity and power and wealth Moses his name as the son of Pharaoh's daughter gave him all of that but he refused it and walked a destiny not knowing where he was going a former Prince as it were a former wealthy man is there in the desert under a tent with his wife with his son with some chickens with some dogs with and then he sees a pudding bush he doesn't know what it is he knows what he's not but he doesn't know what he is he doesn't even know what it is so he said I will turn aside and see what this is this thing is strange but there's something attractive meter I don't know what it is let me turn aside and see this great sight and when he gets up there take off your shoes for when you're standing this is holy ground and Moses see wait a minute this is this feels us this feels different all my experience in Egypt pan compared with this all I saw in Egypt the science in Egypt can explain this you may be seated understand this all of his education all of his experience could not prepare him for what he encountered God being in a Minnesota Moses but the Branham said was a burning bush experience five minutes in the presence of God your life is changed forever and God began to tell Moses Moses I'm calling you to deliver the people Moses former politician former Prince former rulers in Lord I can't walk I am positive Moses they trained in speech but under the law of the pillars I see Laura catwalk and we preached this before when he was done God see any more excuses you're still going because you are born to be a deliverer and God took Moses through some experiences he dropped on your rod and and he showed them and then Moses a question who shall I see what is your name and God responded I am tell them I am that I am so Moses got the first key into this powerful name I am whatever you need you need healing I am your healing you need the LeBaron's I am your deliverance you need a breakthrough I am your break see you need the Holy Ghost I am the Holy Ghost you need power I am power you whatever you need that's what I am and Moses but the random tortoise that David Moses Abraham drawed scripture where the Knights had no clue of what they represented on the great plan of God they live their lives not knowing the purpose that he had but when God would have told Abraham that my seed was the gern in a strange land and with a mighty hand I would bring them out God was talking about Moses that was his name that was his mystery that was his scripture Moses just had to find it you have to find your word you have to find your scripture you have to find a mystery of who you are because that's the key to your revival that's the key to your breakthrough that's the key to you overcoming you have to know who you are because once you know who you are then the rapture is gonna go hallelujah where their parent auteurs Jesus have perfect faith which was peace in his position and your position is also based on who you are when you know your son of the king that gives you authority you can be the son of the President it doesn't matter if you slept outside your house last night you still the son of the president you can make a mess here it doesn't matter you are still the son of the President and we are children of the King our Father is the king of kings he is the lord of lords he is mighty in pattern and your mistakes your failures what you did wrong will not stop the plan of God concerning you from the moment you were born the prophecy of God hung over your life to bring you to the spot until you can realize [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] look at Jesus Jesus grew up as Joseph's son in fact there in script addressed is not this Joseph's son there was nothing spectacular about him when he was one two three four five six seven eight his only when he was in the temple and the parents came and they left him and they left him with the elders and the teachers and they forgot Jesus and they went and they realized that when they come back they came back to see the elders taking knows God Jesus confounded them they had no idea even then that they were speaking to the wood itself they just marveled he was just here fellowship and along the scriptures opening and see I never heard that one before I've been to so many seriously what that boy said is my but there was still no Marvel about him and the battery said it was his custom to go to church it's what the Bible says Jesus is in church just like we all in service this morning and in that day brother Stephen they would invite a young brother to take a chance cual every description it was normal so they call brother Jesus would you come they have no expectation of anything that he would do so Jesus just walks up find the scripture whatever any heart brother does share with any heart and find open the choice that one I want Isaiah 60:1 oh yeah that service it was turnaround grittier brother and me turn around God bless you Jesus Simon David ding Jeremiah Ella who she's one of the brothers nobody knew who he was and he says to read Spirit of the Lord is upon me for he has anointed me to I when he finished reading everybody normal normal and when Jesus supposed but he said this Dida script is fulfilled and that's when the season changed what was it he found his scripture he found his name he found his message he found his ministry he found his purpose he found his identity [Music] and that was when his ministry started [Music] you see if you don't know who you are then you will never become all that you could be that's a problem to me people live in identity crisis in the message don't know who they are coming to church but don't know who you are because when you know who you are you can't be in any way you want to be here it takes me back to the story the Prophet said of the slave owners and the slave traders and this man came to buy slaves and he looking around and everybody just there they're there but there was one who says different so you say can i man I want to see he's not for sale does he eat better than everybody else no does he sleep anyway I don't know so what's about him I always wonder that myself until I found out that we're back in Africa his father is the king of the tribe and despite the fact that he is in America he knows he's a son of a king and he acts like one he knew who he was his environment didn't change who he was the food didn't change who he was the clothes he wore didn't change who he was where he slept didn't change who he was and when you get a revelation of who you are in God your house your car your job doesn't matter because you are some of the King and your inheritance is done here we shall reign on the earth that's become that's your inheritance that's your portion that's your promise can the church seaman [Applause] so cata revelation this morning so the Bible is a book of mysteries and every mystery has to be unfolded and Bible says in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound a mystery of God should be finished so we had a time when there are no more mysteries because the Prophet came to reveal every mystery so it'll be a mission to the world but to the bride instant one mystery because God has been revealing himself since Genesis he has been revealing himself and we have preached it before that God has a mystery he was too big he was too powerful to reveal himself all at once he was too majestic he's too mighty he's too powerful to come all at once at the beginning of time so he had to out for himself in pieces yet unfallen self in parts as it were yet then fall himself slowly because the world can handle all it was this power that's coming would be so great but the balance said it'll be a short quick message doctor shake the whole nation he's in a world when the neighbors are empty in the power [Applause] and in Jesus had attributes you know and it's a word but we are getting to somewhere and Jesus had attributes to be a deliverer how can he display that attribute of a deliverer so when Abraham showed us that all these characters in scripture in the world and in the message was God revealing himself in part so Moses was the deliverer that was the attribute of God as a deliverer in God was the attribute to be a shepherd so God had to find somebody to express this attribute of a shepherd so you found David and went even was living he was expressing his Shepherd attribute of God in quad was the attribute to be a warrior he said the battle is not yours but it's the Lord but the banner piece of message great warrior Joshua he said there was no warrior like Joshua Joshua represented the attribute of God as a warrior you know hear me this morning in God was the attribute to be prophet there's a mighty prophet in the Bible name is Elijah the prophetic ministry of Elijah is so powerful it's repeated its own five times in Scripture Elijah Elijah John the Baptist William Branham and Elijah to come and that was all reflecting the prophetic attribute that was locked up in God God was slowly unveiling himself in the simplest of ways using men who didn't know what they were doing but he was unveiling himself he was revealing himself when Solomon was writing all the great wisdom he was representing the great wisdom of God he was no man on earth as wise as Solomon that was God being expressed through Solomon and the church came in when shunga was fed up of the Philistines or whoever it was come in and take what he had come God took the Ox coat and he said listen enough is enough Sanga was expressing attribute of God to say enough is enough you have been troubling my people for too long all you don't hear me this morning Oh somebody pitch back to me somebody puts back to me they all had their scriptures they all had in ministries they all had their messages there'll be a voice of one crying in the wilderness of that scripture enough over until John the Baptist came and his ministry was unfolded every ministry was hidden in secret wrapped up in the mind of God the devil away she knows what Scripture is your scripture the devil wishes he knows what prophecy is your prophecy you may be seated for a minute when they found the scripture about deliverer when they heard a rumor there was a deliverer that's why Pharaoh such a killer all little children in the time of Jesus being born when the three wise men came down to Jerusalem and all that the reason they tried to kill the kids is because there was a rumor there was a scripture there's a prophecy and the devil always tries to figure out even with Jesus if they'll be if they'll be he didn't even know who Jesus was he didn't even know what Jesus purpose was and the devil doesn't know who you are he doesn't know what you I put my sins he doesn't know what your measure is [Applause] or somebody please back to me that's obviously if the devil knew what Jesus ministry was and if he understood what Jesus had to do the devil would have never let Jesus died he would have propped him up he would I make sure he stay as long as possible but the devil had no clue he doesn't understand the way God works because God said for my daughter I higher than your torture the devil has no idea and the mystery of who you are is she'll under the Seventh Seal hidden under the seven shield so that the devil could do nothing about it but the Branham said if I have a secret I don't want you to know about it I'm not gonna tell anybody so heaven went silent when you open the Seventh Seal There was silence in heaven because the mystery of who you are had to be unfolded but God didn't trust anybody with that secret because you are too important to him [Applause] [Music] Oh hallelujah shake yourself this morning shake yourself this morning hallelujah shake out of your condition check out of your sickness that is not your name being a church member that's not your name just being a message that's not my name coming to church that's not my name my name is greater than that my name is more powerful than that you may be seen it for a minute let me preach some more so when all these men were here they were all representing parts of God David apart solomon apart elijah apart elijah apart david apart Elijah apart solomon apart just walk apart Noah apart Moses apart John the part when Jesus came but the Branham taught us that Christ Himself was the mystery of God all of the pots came into this one he was prophet he was teacher he was Messiah he was king of Jesus he was Lord of lords he was the Rose of Sharon he was the lily of Valley it was Jesus in Noah it was Jesus in Abraham it was Jesus in the prophets it was Jesus when David was swinging that sling it was Jesus in Athens overcame Goliath [Applause] hallelujah who do you think has been keeping you alive all this time but the panel said you are not even the believer the world in you that Jesus is the believer he believes his own word he will bring his words a pass you are not even never leave er but the word in you that's the believer somebody you gonna shut up raise you couldn't come here this morning unless the Jesus and you woke you up this morning because he wanted to come into his tabernacle and fellowship with the scene so it was Jesus Jesus and me Jesus in me [Applause] [Music] Oh you may be seated for a minute hallelujah oh it feels good in here this morning it's not you keeping yourself it's not you believe it but it sees us the world see them in your soul it's in seed form hasn't grown fully yet but it still Jesus Jesus and the manger was the weapon that God was gonna use to destroy the sinners shoot he was little as a baby Oh Gaga googoo and the devil if he had known that that Gaga ku1 T would be Lazarus come floor he would have killed him if the devil knew when you are baby the two are weapon of mass destruction hallelujah Oh somebody brings back to me when you balance when you make mistakes you were just like Abraham just like Elijah you may be seated the Bible call them men of light passions just like you and me the same struggles that you go through Elijah went through the Bible called Stephen a man after God's own heart you may be seated read the sounds in the book of sounds you read and see every emotion that man could go through Lord how they are increase that trouble me Mary I need eyes up against me many Athena shades of my soul there's no help for him in God but but now Oh Lord are a shield for me isn't that what we go through he is the shear he is the buckler [Applause] and David was just a pot [Applause] Oh Oh somebody please back to me Oh downstairs in the back all over the pillar had some vision what is your name your name is overcomer your name is bride of Jesus Christ your name is a hidden mystery [Applause] [Music] [Applause] name above names name above names there's a reason sickness has names everything has a name and if you know the name then to expose the name and to bring the power of the name listen if a sergeant the balance' the authority of a police officer is based on his uniform and of what he represents so when he speaks he's speaking in the name of something so that's why in the country there's a commander-in-chief so take the British Army the the ships are each MS Her Majesty's service they're coming in the name of the Queen but there are different levels of names so the cancer is a name cancer can be identified you can refer to it and we can also speak to it depression is a name you can identify it you can co-ed adoptees seller you are depressed alright it's been identified you can refer to it but I my depression really really hammer under the roots and it has to come a point in your walk where you have to address it so even Jesus when he came to Legion what did he do he asks a question what is your name because he needed to understand what he was dealing with because once he knows the name and his name is a name above all other names [Applause] you are coming in a Hyomin you really didn't I give an example so a sergeant could be operating but if the Commissioner comes if the sergeant tell you pack your things all the car the commissioner speaks of a higher name because his position carries greater weight so you can say put it back and in sergeant car come and see I tell him no because the commissioners rank his authority his name is higher than the name of the sergeant by whose authority are you here when sergeant so-and-so never to come nowhere tell him the Commissioner told you it's ok because his name is higher than his name so when you read scripture and you study scripture Jesus is not a king the Bible discovers the King of Kings because of all kind of Kings but this one is different his kingship is bigger than other kingship that's why listen you may be seated sirrah called Abraham Lord as always teased my wife without him Sirocco Abraham Lord I'm still working that net that message I get home yet but Jesus is the Lord of lords King of Kings Lord of lords his name is higher than every other name so what is your problem this morning can we name them and if we can name them we could overcome them so if your trouble is lost this morning I speak the last I addressed earlier please by the name of all of the needs in the name of Jesus that lost demoness clap to call that demon of prancer by the name above every other name at the name of Jesus dancer has classic old Depression catechu flat-sided classical whatever it is we bring under subjection to the greatest power this world has ever seen [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] can we take someone so Elijah David Abraham they were all part part and Jesus came he was all and then the Prophet brought her all that was in God pour into Christ all of us in Christ porns is right this did not exist with Abraham this is it did not exist with David they could not have contained all they were just a part but what makes this unique is that this is private Okemo yes when Abraham when sorry when Adams today in the Garden of Eden and go out perform surgery and put Adam as with a daily spoke under anesthesia and perform surgery and cut off your rib and and when you wake up Eve walking around aimlessly in the garden and but the day they said Adam and Eve who are you I don't know where I come from I don't know where you're going I don't know Marilla said Adams all Eve's identity crisis said you are flesh of my flesh you are porn of my porn you are spirit of my spirit and because you were taken out of me he had to give her name you will be called woman because you have to have a name there's no name unless you know that nameless and he got of a meal but when God saw that God loved it and for all these years he has been waiting for his opportunity to be able to do like Adam you are flesh of my flesh you you are born of my own see you you are spirit of my spirit God have been waiting for centuries to be able to finally right lady who he could describe and that he have searched high and low he has searched all over until he can find somebody he can see you flesh of my flesh you pull of my bone you spread on my skirt this is a different relationship this is not Abraham and David no this is wife but Abraham said she is him they will be one so in the past even throughout after Jesus left Peter said in the name of Jesus rise up and walk what did it brother branham said he said he won't even need to say in Jesus name because she and him is one when she speaks is one speaking her name is as good as her husband's name it's a joint account see so many brothers shaken I wanted em join the contine listen we see the thing about this account is the call is inexhaustible the money means account does never run out so she could write whatever checks you want she could take a card and swipe how much time she wants and the account still of money because it's God's account and she is united to him they will be one that's why the devil is so mad and that's why I just want you to know who you are because once you know you are you know your authority and your access you are being prepared right now you are walking into the bank account to receive your card [Music] you are being prepared because his wife had made herself ready there's coming a time when you'll be ready and that's what God is waiting for once more the world will hear direct from God it'll be the final voice of the final is Jesus has done his part he's waiting for his lady to represent him because this bride will not be like if this bride will give the devil the knockout punch that Abraham couldn't give him Moses couldn't give him David couldn't give him trust what couldn't give him when this bride is rich with the devil that will be wiped out thousand years locked up can the church seamen so get ready get ready get ready this is our dream this is our season holy mother Bremen is craving bright time see time manifestation time this is what you've been waiting for women here for more church we're not here for more church church age is over we are here to get out of here this is rapture time this is family time this is release my son it's time to go that's the time we're living in temple take your hands off my daughter take your hands off my wife take your hands off my child take got to go what did when the balance said right now we lay hands on the sick but when that time comes what do you do you commanded ever you commanded ever they got to go can the church say Amen could you take some more okay so that's the introduction I want some little energy thing in here [Music] we have prepared retailer Gianna we've been picked me up and go all the way you painted spare our lives worshiping and fellowship your David you know there they are looking on right now shock to them it's because they were not qualified for this is work with you but the Brandon said is he hard is it if you're in school you can go from form one two four five or homesick so from one to form fifty university you'll fail and Godman court looked at the ages he say you know what Abraham perfect man early you have totally powerful ministry but early because this is the age of deception so I need to have a people who will look like they're not gonna make it what did when the random study said when you get over there you will see people over there who you didn't think we're gonna make it so God pick some people who look as they're not gonna make it and the devil looking at you and he think he knows your name but I but I know Tony I know I know you're I know I know and what a devil doesn't realize that all easy as we have been wrestling with the angel in whatever way you've been wrestling with the injured and it wasn't your own strength rustling but God is working his way out because you war he longs to express himself he has no eyes but your eyes he has no hands but your hands he has no feet but your feet he belongs to expressives to make himself known so you are going to make it don't be discouraged you have what it takes to have a testimony you have what it takes to have a testimony in this day and age can the church say Amen Oh give the Lord I have a praise not gonna be too much longer but you are the mystery that was in the back parts of God's mind your mystery tear family your mystery to your friends young people you are mystery and as a messenger people do remember that under 21st Saturday the 25th we have youth service and all are welcome but you are miss city of families your mission to your friends stop even trying to explain yourself to them because they cannot understand you we will never understand you what the world is not an explanation the world is alive because that's the funder that sheiks the devil you are God's mystery hallelujah the world cannot understand you you are the mystery of God can the church say Amen but the Branham said if you know positionally who you was and what you are tonight say today there wouldn't be a feeble person in here in the next five minutes so every service we are preaching the word to bring you to a spot to realize who you are to realize and we have to die out to our own feelings our emotions or perceptions even our our understanding because our understanding is limited what we could comprehend is unlimited and God is so simple that he doesn't require education to understand him so it's not about your intellect if God could take a prophet who was not educated to bring the greatest message to the it it's not about your education it's about surrender it's about surrendering completely to God can the church say Amen but Iran I'm in a message beginning and ending of the Gentile dispensation he says see we come out of eternity that's where we come from we was before there was a world did you know that God made man in his own image where was you he said to Joe when Jobe thought he had some wisdom look hope with the random describes is when job thought he had some wisdom God had to remind you where was you when I laid a foundation hallelujah blessed be the name of the Lord hmm the power of a name just thing friends that when Jesus stood at the grave of Lazarus where the Branham said if he didn't call Lazarus my name everybody was gonna come at the grave you know my my my my but he knows your name and every service we come to is the word calling your name so when you hear the word preach and you hear the word speaks about adoption you say wait a minute that's that's me you might not understand it but but you're talking about me you hear perfection that's me you're talking about me you hear the Holy Ghost that's me you hear overcome and that's me when you hear sinless life that's me children ah sputtering oh that's me I want to be in that church I out but that's who I am but that is my name that's my identity that's my identification that's who I am can the chat's amen Oh blessed be the name of the Lord the musician we'll get ready I'm gonna keep you too much longer the mystery of who you are when I get to something here I have enough notes for two hours but Laurie I want to kneel along your name Bella Branham said in Mary's belief he promised in the last is that the church will grow so close from the days of Luther justification days of Wesley certification deeds of the Pentecost the restoration of gifts right into their headstone and truths that would bring forth the whole body the resurrection of every believer but as the Spirit of God grows closer just like the shadow of my hand the shadow gets darker and darker until the shadow and the hand becomes the same thing the church come from justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost now going into the very headstone and the presence of the angel of God Jesus Christ the Holy Ghost so present doing exactly the same works and he did a huge which is bringing for the church and Christ to unite together just exactly like you promised don't let listen to the prophet your conscience beat down now wake up in smoke ability original CD says all right now here's what I'm trying to say to you the law of reproduction bring forth of its kind these last days true church bride comes to the headstone will be the super Church a super race as they made a great answer that's your name that's describing you the same way scripture described everyone in the Bible this is your description as they need a great headstone super Church super ace they will be one even they will be in as very image in order to be united with him there will be the very manifestation of the word of the Living God that is your name you will be the very manifestation of the word of the Living God when you hear that you say that's me I will be the very manifestation of the word of the I want I want you to say it I will be the very manifestation of the world of the living god that's who you are that's your name so then once you know that that's your name you could begin like Moses to refuse every other name anything else is false anything else is off but the balance that denominations could never produce this they will produce their creeds and their dogmas mixed with the wood and bring a hybrid product then when they balance it from a little group a little group of the true seed of the world we know the court God will present Christ a beloved bride flesh of my flesh born of my bone spirit of my spirit a virgin of version of his would and through them and by them whip you fulfil all that has been promised for the word in the Virgin who knows no man may increase and dogmas that's your name that's who you are no madman Creek gone is not trusting no man with his lady it's his lady is his bride and she were not perfect but they ran a said be manhandled this is his lady you belong to God you are engaged to God but the Branum call it a wedding or the engagement ring of predestination the engagement and the wedding planner precision that's what was pleased on you before the foundation of the world and the devil is mad about it Oh hallelujah he's upset about it here is the secret the word is in the bride and the mind of Christ to know what he wants done with the wood and she does it in his name she has thus saith the Lord no one can persuade them different family cannot persuade you different your coworkers can persuade you different the young people cannot persuade you different they have thus saith the Lord or they keep still then they will do the works of God can the church seamen go ahead and waiting a long time for this super church that's your name you are part of that super church Oh hallelujah glory glory glory oh and your purpose will be accomplished and friends you can't run from it you can't hide from it and every move you step I sweated young people in South Africa you even realize you in an aquarium your every move is checked when you want to go

born under you could try whatever you want when God said Jonah I have a work for you oh yeah do what I say that not not Mina I mean Jonah was supposed to go this way Joe and I had this way as quick as he could took out over attacked you whatever he took when the other way and end up on a ship the viruses and Jonah on this ship what I love about Jonah is that when DeStorm come do an if' pretending they're people who Peter is not them ignore the situation let him you know join say listen I am the problem throw me overboard and that is what shows he has seated on you know but the Branham said when a sheep for than a mud what does it do it cries it bleeds the Christ but when you put a pig any mud because he loves to wallow the Prophet said in that environment so it shows that Jonah is sheep because when these ships after Rock he recognized I am the problem that's it and we have to come to this spot analyzes in Lord I've been the problem God is the problem and they will preach some weeks ago and says people blame Gordon Gordon around is we but the brand said God never leaves us we any ones who walk away and he said if you want to get back with him go right back to the place that you left him what is your name this morning we know Jesus is his name but he is called wonderful he is called the counselor he is called so your name and I believe it but the Branham also said you have your name and his name you make for yourself the Bible said it's better to have a good thing then all said all other stuff all right so but what is your name there are people whose names identified by the behaviors when I was in primary school these are called me all kind of names read boy so if you commemorate by the new who was being referred to other thing is the same but this new comer square head [Music] but it Stephen you cannot get cookin another that was not my name but it was what I was called so his name is Jesus but he's called wonderful he's counselor right but our lives create a name for us is the naming me for yourself so like Jacob his name is Jacob but he was a deceiver in our lives in our marriages in our houses on the job we all have names it might be in a pleasant waiting nickname or few people give my college boy I rather they call me church boy than party boy because your name speaks to your life so when we read all these quotes and the Prophet said is not leave alone my never list that's not the name my name is the mystery of who you are the name is a new word John the Baptist his name is voice of one crying out in the world as we call him John but his name is voice of one crying in the wilderness that's his identification he could find where it's written so too you need to look at your life and be able like Jacob to say well my name is Jacob but there's another name because you have overcome your past you have overcome your weakness you overcome some people that name is duty could you always duty in some places you see lead comma just reach it's not what your name is was what they call you is still identified by the same thing but if that's your Testament is that is that your name what is your name your name is player L player a player and we live in a world where people take on names on their lives I'm shutter key laughs that is your name is that what you want to be cool on that great day when were like what what did they call it because your name is called by your life so that's why when Jesus is described he's described as wonderful counselor because the name is the descriptions of his activities behave his nature so you can identify it so all that's wonderful in your life that's Jesus counselor mighty God everlasting father Prince of Peace when people say George kangri what do they say when they say eyes are covered what do they say when they say money what do they say about you what is your name your name is your testimony their people have stood in funerals and services and we can poll and see one thing we could see he was a prayer warrior so he can attach that to your name what do we attach to your name today what is your name is it great warrior is it I've never said she was a real seed she loved the Lord all of time you could hear tippling in the background what is your name do you have one name in church and another name Anuja some ham I'm brother John but in work to puck and instead of being like Moses and Hebrews who refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter the Bible says what nîmes are you rejecting your name is not movie watcher your name is not social drinker your name is not compromiser your name is not trying to fit in in fact with the brand name use another name to describe us he called us alcohol that's my name if you don't want to call me Isaac call me up walk we talked about Joshua what's his name but they're random attached great warrior to it great warrior Joshua so if you walk to the camps of the truth of Israel and you don't know his name you see where is the great warrior and they could point you in the direction of Joshua because his behavior his conduct his attribute brought his name to life we're the random taught us your name is the Michelle who you are and the most important theme is not the name if you were given it's a name that you make for yourself Lord we have the name of pray warrior Lord let me have a name of overcomer because the purposes of the him that overcometh will I give a new name that only he will know in fact the Prophet frozen when Jesus overcame he also ascended and received a new name that's why the prophecy that's where the Hollande showed the way they do and they don't get their presence er but that neighbor very feelin abundance that's the message this applies beyond applying it in the context of church Petropolis their life as a husband as a wife as a young person as a son as a daughter as someone on your job in your school what name are you known by what is your name it might sound rough when they say your Chili's boy and you're boring let boring be my name if boring keeps you away from the world take what Moses did because Moses rejected do you know how tempting it is to be fair what if more so I say you know if I could be fair oh you know I could release the children of Israel you know much thought sort of going through his mind as his son of Pharaoh's daughter but the Bible says he rejected the riches he rejected a temptation he refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter and preferred being identified with the slaves Moses his greatest achievement greatest achievement is saying no because he had not said no there would be no tablets with the commandments Moses wrote the first five books of the Bible that he had not said no who would have written those books thank God that Moses said no thank God and Moses refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter we can be born in this world but we are not of this world we reject what the devil places upon us we reject the temptation and desires it's so simple but it's choking our lives you have books and teeth with your praises choked because you are taking on other names trying to sound like the world trying to be like the world what is your name is your name as a father never around where's your name example my father is a good example it's okay to talk about what you did not have I remember years when I was young maybe eight nine years old and I'm old brother 50 some years would say he still can overcome hope his father didn't give it my long pants and it might sound maybe funny and one is a extent but that was his testimony but it has to come a point where you shake that off and decide what you do for your children because you can't change the past you cannot go back in the past Paul taught us to forget the things of the past he said I reach I stretch I press my way towards before the beautiful thing about Jacob is his name change overnight and that's what I'm looking for in my life what I'm looking for in your life that you're gonna walk into this service with one name and leave this service with another name so now when the devil might be looking for you under your only when you walk out you can walk straight pass him and say I don't know who you talking about [Music] if you want to check for that guy you can look for him but he's no longer here that guy doesn't live in this house anymore in this house lives the Holy Ghost and this houses sheets lets you knowledge temperance patience godliness brotherly kindness charity the Lord sits on the throne of my heart that's the old man I put away the old man my name has been changed my identity has been changed my nature has been changed that's what the Holy Ghost is given so young people don't Emily do it this thing about names is a powerful thing all these artists young people I'm gonna speak it on people for a little bit all these artists why is it they change their names we could go into that in a long way but many things are connected and such deep spiritualization you have no idea and people put names on the children based on movies based on artists based on books written by demon-possessed people and they place these names on their children so the Prophet taught us give your child a good name but we are not talking right now but what you are called on people what about the name you make for yourself let your name be a testimony let's when people mention your name they think of honesty you think of truth they think of righteousness they think of peace they think of a prayer life let them associate you with Christianity how many young people don't want to be known as Christian what's wrong with you this is the best thing you could ever decide to do I have decided to follow Jesus and not just be a Christian but to have this message and not be blinded and to have the truth that is a rapture coming I have the truth that the Holy Ghost is mentored well in us and control us that all age is waiting for us to come to perfection whether brother Branham is waiting on you and I Abraham is waiting and you and I to come to perfection to bring on the resurrection that's my name that's my purpose that's what I'm supposed to do or maybe change your walk this morning change your walk when Jacobs name was change his walk change he was out of joint so it's not just a teen of your name and your behavior but your walk is different your talk is different and you have to be willing to give it up willing to give up what you hold dear willing all for the cross beam is healing can begin to play something softly I want to give you a challenge this week for words that's not my name when the music comes when the temptation come when you feel like gossiping that's not my name gossip is not my name doubt is not my name unbelief is not my name this week is gonna be the best week of your life when depression comes that's got my name frustration that's of my name black bean that's not my name I'm not accepting that name when you get down time to in your private moments of Prayer and as everyone to bring other stuff for you to do that's not my name and something on the inside begins to take over and you press your way because you want a relationship with God what good is it to come to church and go home to see what use is it to come to the house of God and go home the same but the Brandon said you can't even come to the presence of God and go home the same you change either for the better for the worse and I'll close it with this I said it I believe a couple Sundays ago I said it's the most painful Scripture I've read in my life when I saw it the way that I did because you would normally think that when you meet Jesus everything is all right you would feel aware he would come to Jesus your questions will be answered you would think that when you come to Jesus you will leave knowing that all it's gonna be all right but when the rich young ruler came up to Jesus he came as it were with a sincere heart he said Lord what must I do to get eternal life and he was asking for something and we ought to be pressing our lives too and make our pricey lord I want eternal life lord I want the whole it was Lord I want to be different Laura what must I do and Jesus looked at him the wood made flesh and said obey the commandments honor your father and mother couldn't do the law and the old men said I've done that from my youth but and I'm not missing something what lack I yet and the word itself a discerner of the thoughts and a heart begin to scan his life as it were like the world is scanning our lives this morning scanning all of our lives a spiritual x-ray as it was to get a deeper look and where the luck is in me where the luck is in you and Jesus said to him sell all you have and give to the poor and the saddest scripture in the Bible to me this man walked away from Jesus sorrowful how could you walk away from Jesus said how could you walk away from Jesus without help how can you walk away from Jesus without getting your problem so how could you walk away from Jesus disappointed how can you walk away from Jesus and still be sick how could you walk away from Jesus and not get an answer to your problem how could you walk away from Jesus and I'd want to do something about your trouble when the word identified your trouble by name Jesus identified what his trouble was and he walked away sorrowful friends don't leave their service disappointed don't lean a service without getting their answers you need to take you to where you need to be in Christ I challenge you father mother brother sister young person old the word has spoken this morning and every Sunday every service the word speaks to you get your life right with God get your heart right with God what is your name I'll close with this I believe was the sons of sceva but time I cast out Devils and the devil spoke to them Jesus I know my name pizza I know who are you [Music] not only must God know your name the devil must know your name and when your life has power the devil will take note that your life has power and the batteries that you shall receive power after the Holy Ghost comes upon you and you shall be witnesses unto me God is looking for individuals to be witnesses the letters will know you could have some but you cannot have all [Music] you could have some of the marriages but not all you could have some of the young people but not all we will have individuals who will stand for truth stand for righteousness middle or richly bless you [Music] [Applause] Oh
