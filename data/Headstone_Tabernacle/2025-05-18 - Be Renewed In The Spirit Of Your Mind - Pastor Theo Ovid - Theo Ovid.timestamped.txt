[38:10] with me in the darkness, in the tempest,
[38:13] in the storm. He deserves all the glory.

[38:19] friend to the friendless. He's a father
[38:21] to the fatherless. He's here this
[38:23] morning. He's my help in time of need.
[38:26] He's my strong tower. He is my rock. He
[38:30] is my fortress. He is my reason. He is
[38:33] my heartbeat. He is my song. Somebody

[43:05] morning. If you have your Bibles, I'd
[43:07] like you to go to the scriptures.
[43:08] Ephesians 4. We want to read from verse
[43:11] 17 to
[43:13] 32 from the book of Ephesians chapter 4.
[43:23] This I say therefore and testify in the
[43:27] Lord that he henceforth walk not as
[43:30] other Gentiles walk in the vanity of
[43:33] their mind having the understanding
[43:36] darkened being alienated from the life
[43:38] of God through the ignorance that is in
[43:40] them because of the blindness of their
[43:42] heart. who being past feeling have given
[43:45] themselves over to lazifiousness to work
[43:48] all uncleanness with greediness, but you
[43:51] have not so learned Christ. If so be
[43:54] that you have heard him and have been
[43:57] taught by him as the truth is in Jesus
[44:01] that you put off concerning the former
[44:03] conversation the old man which is
[44:05] corrupt according to deceitful lust and
[44:09] be renewed in the spirit of your mind
[44:14] that you may put on the new man which
[44:16] after God is created in righteousness
[44:19] and true holiness. Wherefore put no way
[44:22] lying. Speak every man truth with his
[44:25] neighbor. For we are members one of
[44:28] another. Be angry and sin not. Let not
[44:31] the son go down upon your wrath. Neither
[44:34] give place to the devil. Let him that
[44:36] stole steal no more. But rather let him
[44:39] labor working with his hands the thing
[44:41] which is good that he may have to give
[44:43] to him that need it. Let no corrupt
[44:46] communication proceed out of your mouth,
[44:48] but that which is good to the use of
[44:50] edifying, that it may minister grace
[44:53] unto the hearers. And grieve not the
[44:55] Holy Spirit of God, whereby you are
[44:57] sealed unto the day of redemption. Let
[45:00] all bitterness and wrath and anger and
[45:02] clamor, evil speaking, be put away from
[45:04] you with
[45:06] malice. And be kind one to another,
[45:09] tender-hearted, forgiving one another,
[45:11] even as God for Christ's sake had
[45:13] forgiven you. Let's bow our heads.
[45:14] Heavenly Father, we thank you for your
[45:15] word this morning and I pray will come
[45:18] into it and speak to our hearts. We need
[45:20] to hear from you. We need this word to
[45:23] come alive and be made real to your
[45:24] people. So may that revealing anointing
[45:26] come upon your people this morning and
[45:28] give them divine revelation in Jesus
[45:30] name I ask it. Amen. And if you may be
[45:32] seated. Praise God. A wet morning, a
[45:35] rainy day. We under yellow alert, bad
[45:38] weather, but we all of you coming out
[45:40] here this morning. It's great. Thanks so
[45:42] much for coming out. Amen. Praise the
[45:44] Lord.
[45:45] Amen.
[45:47] Okay. So, I have a title. Be renewed in
[45:50] the spirit of your mind. Amen. That's
[45:53] the title. Be renewed in the spirit of
[45:56] your
[45:57] mind. Having that means having a fresh
[46:01] mental and spiritual attitude.
[46:05] I think that
[46:06] uh they say sometimes as different
[46:09] things is like some kind of cross in
[46:11] your brains and at times I guess people
[46:14] sometimes get cross in their mind
[46:16] sometime they going through routines and
[46:18] and rhythms and like the scribe and
[46:21] Pharisees they would be going through
[46:22] the same routine over and over so it
[46:25] become a ritual no sincerity to God
[46:27] they're just performing rituals they're
[46:30] just doing things after a while people
[46:33] come to church like that it's like a
[46:35] ritual. It has no real depth or meaning.
[46:39] You don't want to appear backsliden, so
[46:40] you come to church. But the reality is,
[46:43] is it a reality to you? Is it does it
[46:47] mean anything to you? What does it mean
[46:48] to you? Now, note
[46:51] that um that the people that he is
[46:55] preaching to here, Paul, is believers.
[46:57] Amen. And he is telling them now you
[47:00] have
[47:01] to put on the new man and put off the
[47:05] old man. And I remember hearing a story
[47:07] about young brother who was hearing
[47:10] about not in this church about put
[47:12] putting out the old man putting out the
[47:14] old man and he they want to come back to
[47:16] church no more. He said but what the old
[47:18] man do them? They only want to put out
[47:20] the old man. They preaching against the
[47:21] old man and the old man. And he said he
[47:23] find this church don't not supporting
[47:25] old men at
[47:26] all. And something that somebody think
[47:29] about how the mind of a child will be
[47:31] thinking what's wrong with the old man
[47:33] just keep they keep put off the old man
[47:35] throw off the old man get rid of the old
[47:37] man. So it's not that old mom you're
[47:39] talking about it's the real old mom
[47:41] you're talking about which is you and
[47:42] your senses. All right. So tonight I I
[47:46] feel great about what I've been here
[47:48] this morning and I want to share
[47:50] something with you brother.
[47:54] Lookie friends, let me give this
[47:55] illustration. I might done it before.
[47:57] What color is that shirt? It's white.
[48:00] Anyone knows sight that shirt is white.
[48:03] You have five senses of the body. See,
[48:06] taste, feel, smell, and hear. Now, none
[48:09] of those senses will declare God.
[48:13] Amen. I want you to listen closely to
[48:17] today. None of those senses will declare
[48:20] God. When God made man, he made him in
[48:23] his image instead of man's. And he put
[48:26] him in five senses to contact his
[48:28] earthly home, not to contact God with.
[48:33] So those senses don't declare God. They
[48:36] declare the earthly home where man had
[48:39] to contact his earthly home. He had to
[48:41] see, taste, feel, feel, smell, and hear.
[48:44] But faith is the substance of things
[48:47] hoped for, the evidence of things not
[48:49] seen. You do not see it, taste it, feel
[48:53] it, smell it, hear it, but you believe
[48:55] it. This we getting on to the message
[48:58] now. Now, if every person in here, if
[49:02] this boy sitting here, if this lady
[49:05] sitting here, the young lady sitting
[49:06] here, I'm talking to cripples of course
[49:08] here and there, and the people that got
[49:10] diseases. If you believe, if you pray
[49:13] right now until you are so sure that you
[49:16] were healed, just as sure as say that
[49:18] that that's white, the shirt is white.
[49:21] In other words, he's showing you faith
[49:22] as something tangible. Faith is not an
[49:25] imaginary thing. Faith is actually a
[49:28] substance. It is that real. Faith is not
[49:31] hope. Faith is that real. It's a
[49:35] substance of what you're hoping for.
[49:36] Isn't that right? I assure you if you
[49:39] get that type of faith, God Almighty
[49:41] will speak through me and tell you you
[49:43] are healed and will reveal it. Remember
[49:47] God Oka heal you now you're already
[49:49] healed. Is your faith appropriating that
[49:52] healing or your faith claiming that
[49:53] healing or that breakthrough or that
[49:55] deliverance? He already done it. He
[49:56] can't do it again for you. He already
[49:58] done it.
[50:00] When a man was put in human flesh, then
[50:02] God give him five senses to contact. Not
[50:05] God, but his only home.
[50:08] These things the senses of the body is
[50:10] only to declare or contact earthly
[50:13] things here on earth not heavenly
[50:14] things. Then your inward man is the
[50:17] spirit has two senses faith and
[50:19] unbelief. Now faith is the six sense.
[50:22] Five senses control this man. God put
[50:24] man in five senses that earthly home.
[50:26] And there's two senses of the soul.
[50:28] Faith and unbelief. And if you are
[50:30] possessed with faith, here we go. Faith
[50:34] is just as real a reality to you as
[50:38] sight is.
[50:42] So now you begin to see by what he is
[50:44] speaking here, people not really walking
[50:46] by faith. And the faith they think they
[50:49] have, they don't have because faith is a
[50:52] substance.
[50:53] In other words, faith is a reality. I
[50:55] remember uh docking exams at the
[50:58] government service and and whatnot and
[51:01] always ignoring the exam and one day I
[51:03] just knew I was going to pass the exams.
[51:04] I just go on the exam and I'll pass the
[51:06] exams and it get true. But there was
[51:08] something inside of me that that that is
[51:11] faith then faith is just believe things
[51:13] that almost look impossible and you
[51:15] don't even know why you believe it is
[51:16] revealed to you. Praise God. Praise God.
[51:19] Praise God. Faith is a living thing.
[51:21] It's a reality. Praise God. But I stand
[51:24] here by faith today. And I know this
[51:26] will become real to you because there
[51:28] some of you still in your senses.
[51:32] Hallelujah. All right, let's
[51:35] go. Faith is an individual sense besides
[51:41] any dear. It is the sixth sense. So he's
[51:46] identifying faith as a sense. I call it
[51:49] have the sense of sight, the sense to
[51:52] smell, the sense to taste, it have a
[51:54] sense of faith, and when Bar said the
[51:57] faith is milky white out there. He's
[51:59] feeling the faith. Then he said anything
[52:01] could happen because he's contacting the
[52:04] faith amongst the people there. He says
[52:06] white inside of here. Hallelujah.
[52:09] Anything could happen. Praise God. We
[52:11] want the church to come back to that a a
[52:14] position where anything could happen.
[52:16] Not just you come for information or you
[52:18] come for knowledge or you come for
[52:20] mysteries or you come for a long sermon
[52:22] or you come for something to hear
[52:23] something you never heard before. No,
[52:25] you come to get your faith alive. When
[52:27] you leave here, you must be a walking,
[52:29] moving monument of faith. When you open
[52:32] your house, you open out your faith.
[52:34] Glory to God. Hallelujah. When the devil
[52:37] knock on your door, you don't go and run
[52:39] in the bedroom. You open the door and
[52:41] you push your head outside of there and
[52:43] that devil got to go. Oh, give the Lord
[52:45] a shout because thy sea shall possess
[52:47] the gate of the enemy. Hallelujah.
[52:50] Hallelujah.
[52:53] [Applause]
[52:55] Hallelujah. We are too fearful.
[52:59] And fear is connected with unbelief. All
[53:00] right. Let me just go ahead. All right.
[53:02] Go
[53:03] ahead. All right. Notice. Oh, look. I
[53:07] just say that there and the next thing
[53:08] is that there unbelief or completely
[53:10] fear. See, see what inspiration is real
[53:13] there. I am looking at the nose then
[53:15] soon. Next thing is unbelief for
[53:17] companies. I have titles over the where
[53:19] I'm going. Man is soul, body, spirit.
[53:22] Now in his body he has five sensly home.
[53:26] Two senses of his spirit. One of them is
[53:27] unbelief which is of the devil and the
[53:29] other is faith which is of God. Now
[53:31] unbelief can't do nothing for you but
[53:34] damn you. That's all it can do. Destroy
[53:37] you. Faith is the only thing that can
[53:40] help you.
[53:42] Say amen to that. Is the word I'm
[53:45] preaching. Say amen to that. Faith is
[53:47] the only thing to help you.
[53:50] Let's go.
[53:54] Unbelief. There's no value in unbelief
[53:56] at all.
[53:58] And unbelief accomp.
[54:02] Unbelief accompanies fear. Or fear
[54:04] accomplish. When you go to reason and
[54:06] wondering, then you begin to fear.
[54:10] So you have an interview coming up for a
[54:11] job and you're wondering somebody
[54:14] laughing there like somebody going for
[54:15] an interview boy
[54:19] and you're wondering now if you have
[54:22] faith or something revealed through a
[54:24] revelation you have no fear if that job
[54:27] is for you it's for you if it's not for
[54:29] you it's not for you suppose it's not
[54:31] for you you can have all your faith and
[54:32] I believe I believe it's not for you God
[54:34] don't want you there and if God want you
[54:37] there again listen God going to make
[54:39] sure it work out that you get through.
[54:42] As brother but Andrew shared, you're
[54:44] going to find favor and God going to put
[54:45] the key person to unlock the door to
[54:47] say, "Yeah, I won that one." Oh, give
[54:49] the Lord some praises. Glory to God.
[54:52] Hallelujah. When everything against you,
[54:54] God could drop a favor upon you.
[54:58] [Music]
[54:58] [Applause]
[55:00] ask is over much time be coming to the
[55:02] immigration have luggage and sell
[55:04] luggage and stuff and what and they
[55:05] sending everybody to the machine to see
[55:07] what they have and what through the
[55:08] machine and when they see us just let's
[55:10] go through thank you favor
[55:14] and faith
[55:22] I said some time ago if I was in a dead
[55:25] cell and was to die in the Morning by
[55:28] the governor estate was putting me to
[55:31] death in the morning. Fear wouldn't do
[55:33] me any good at all. I go dead. The
[55:36] doctor go dead. Yeah. Go dead because
[55:40] you believe you'll die.
[55:42] Doctor Doctor final say Jehovah have the
[55:46] final say.
[55:48] [Music]
[55:49] Your uncle, your grandfather, your
[55:51] neighbor, people who hate you, they have
[55:53] the final say.
[55:55] Somebody hate you and they saying all
[55:56] kind of thing. This will happen to you.
[55:58] You blight your this that. They don't
[55:59] have the final say. God have the final
[56:02] say. Hallelujah. That's why you carry
[56:05] rely upon man. You can't rely upon your
[56:07] five senses. Because Abraham make senses
[56:10] look foolish. Oh, give the Lord a shout.
[56:13] Abraham defy his own senses. He consider
[56:16] his own body now dead. And you sit there
[56:19] in your flesh feeling, feeling, feeling,
[56:22] feeling. Forget your feeling. Away with
[56:25] your feeling. Who cares about your
[56:27] feeling? God cares about your faith. The
[56:30] only currency that heaven, praise God,
[56:33] respond to. We give the Lord a shout. I
[56:36] don't care if they come to repossess
[56:37] your house in the morning. Faith could
[56:39] make a way.
[56:41] [Music]
[56:43] [Applause]
[56:45] [Music]
[56:50] So he said if he was to be put to death
[56:51] tomorrow, he say unbelief. Give him no
[56:53] help at all. Yes, sir. That's right.
[56:55] Amen. Amen. Then he switched. He said,
[56:58] "Lady sitting here sick. I guess she has
[57:01] a pillow laying by her." Now she's a
[57:03] sick person. She's probably coming to
[57:05] hear the word and maybe to be healed.
[57:07] Now all the fear you have sister would
[57:11] do you no good at all. So he's dealing
[57:14] with fear because fear is also like a
[57:17] substance. You know when fear grippy
[57:19] grippy you know when get rippy all your
[57:21] heart beating fast your chest heaving
[57:24] you're nervous you you don't know how to
[57:26] walk you're walking nervy nervy fear
[57:28] taking you know but the Bible said
[57:30] perfect love cast that out
[57:34] perfect love cast that outl
[57:37] [Applause]
[57:40] I wonder how Daniel must have felt when
[57:42] they was leading to lion's den
[57:47] you At
[57:49] least somebody a mouse. Some people
[57:51] place break
[57:52] up a
[57:56] mouse. This is lion's you know. And that
[57:59] brother had to walk like a soldier. Oh
[58:03] God. Oh God. No. Oh God. I deny him.
[58:07] Are you serving God no more? Hallelujah.
[58:10] Not Daniel. He know God is living. He
[58:13] has faith in God. He have confidence and
[58:16] like all the Cub boy said if the Lord be
[58:19] with us. Praise God. He he he able to
[58:21] deliver us. But if he don't deliver us,
[58:23] we still not going to bow down to the
[58:25] world counselor churches to il papa in
[58:28] Rome to Satan Superman to whatever the
[58:31] governments have to offer. We will not
[58:33] bow down because we have faith in our
[58:35] souls. Faith of our fathers is living
[58:39] still. Tell the world the message is not
[58:42] dead. Tell the world seven thunders is
[58:45] not dead. Give the Lord a shout. It's
[58:47] still divided revival. It's still give
[58:49] faith. Preachers don't want to say it,
[58:51] but we going to say it because the God
[58:53] said it. Oh, give the Lord a shout.
[58:56] There's going to be a super church, a
[58:57] super race. Praise God. Hallelujah.
[59:00] Because God said it. You shall be
[59:02] baptized with the Holy Ghost and fire
[59:05] because God said
[59:07] it. Praise God. Praise God. Your family
[59:10] is going to be delivered. The loved ones
[59:12] are coming in. The sick is going to be
[59:14] healed. The blind is going to see. The
[59:17] deaf is going to heal. The dead is going
[59:19] to be raised. And we going to have a
[59:21] seven thunder bride revival. Oh, the
[59:23] Lord has shout in the house. Take that
[59:25] devil. Praise God. We are free this
[59:28] morning to believe everything that God
[59:30] have said.
[59:35] And if God can't bring it to pass, he is
[59:37] big enough to speak what he can bring to
[59:39] pass. Anything God speak, it could come
[59:42] to pass.
[59:44] Will come to pass.
[59:47] [Applause]
[59:47] [Music]
[59:49] [Applause]
[59:54] I wonder if we coming back to this. Oh,
[59:56] brother Brandham could be talking to
[59:57] sick people. Listen, it had services
[1:00:00] where men only have well people in the
[1:00:03] sick people was come by because them
[1:00:06] intellectual well well taught education
[1:00:09] people and whatn not they only have the
[1:00:11] intellectual crowd but the people want
[1:00:13] to be healed they know where to go the
[1:00:15] people want to be delivered they know
[1:00:16] where to go they know when brother
[1:00:18] Brandham is around there the devil have
[1:00:19] to take a leave but he have to pump some
[1:00:21] faith inside of them because he have to
[1:00:23] show them by the word that the healing
[1:00:25] is already in effect and they have to
[1:00:27] claim it. They have to walk in the light
[1:00:29] of it. Praise God. That's why faith
[1:00:31] could grow. Faith could ripen. Faith
[1:00:32] could mature. Faith don't have to stay
[1:00:34] stunted. And
[1:00:37] you have a kind of short faith. I don't
[1:00:38] know. We call the faith. Then you
[1:00:40] have a kind of faith. Faith how
[1:00:42] to stay no
[1:00:45] Your faith have to grow. And as you hear
[1:00:48] the word, your faith could grow and and
[1:00:51] it growing how? Pass your senses, pass
[1:00:53] your feeling, pass your past, pass your
[1:00:56] fears, pass your complexes. That's why
[1:00:59] you can't bother with all the complexes.
[1:01:00] We can't go through that. You have this
[1:01:01] complex, you have a A complex, a B
[1:01:03] complex, a C complex, where you have 27
[1:01:05] complexes. What we do all of that, we
[1:01:07] have one word for all them complexes.
[1:01:09] Have faith in God. Give the Lord a
[1:01:11] shout. Praise God. Where you're
[1:01:12] crippled, whether your tongue, you can't
[1:01:14] talk, whether you have diabetes, whether
[1:01:17] you have high blood pressure, it doesn't
[1:01:18] matter what you have. God ask you what
[1:01:20] you have. He say if you believe all
[1:01:22] things are possible then you can be
[1:01:24] healed this morning. Then you can be
[1:01:25] sealed this morning. Then if you
[1:01:27] delivered this morning then God can lift
[1:01:29] that darkness over your life. Oh that
[1:01:31] blight over your life could be lifted.
[1:01:34] Oh give the Lord a shout in the house.
[1:01:37] [Music]
[1:01:39] [Applause]
[1:01:43] So he's talking to a woman sick pillow.
[1:01:46] She was lying on somewhere and she said,
[1:01:48] "Listen, all the fear you have, sister,
[1:01:51] would do you no good." So maybe he's
[1:01:52] smelling the fear or seeing the fear on
[1:01:54] on her. He said, "All the fear you have
[1:01:55] wouldn't do you no good. Fear has not
[1:01:57] one value to it. So discard it."
[1:02:01] He's telling a sick woman to discard the
[1:02:03] fear. Oh God, my doctor,
[1:02:08] why would Jesus said, "Pick up and
[1:02:10] walk."
[1:02:12] The man Jesus said, "Help him."
[1:02:14] Oh, God. You sick. Come on. Let me help
[1:02:17] you.
[1:02:19] That trailer I don't know. Hallelujah.
[1:02:23] Hallelujah. He said pick up your bed.
[1:02:27] He didn't just say pick up your bed and
[1:02:29] walk.
[1:02:32] It's just I don't want to lie down there
[1:02:33] on the ground there to show you how you
[1:02:34] do it.
[1:02:36] Can I stop say something wrong with the
[1:02:37] preacher? But that man had to twist. He
[1:02:41] got so good. I s for 40 years
[1:02:45] that not what you hear. You know a
[1:02:48] feeling I feeling stiff.
[1:02:52] I feeling I can't move. Jesus said pick
[1:02:55] up your bed and walk. You hearing that
[1:02:57] and you're still there.
[1:03:00] Well, you dead twice plucked up. You you
[1:03:03] finished.
[1:03:05] If God say pickle bed and walk, start to
[1:03:07] move now.
[1:03:09] start to move towards the back bed ser
[1:03:12] and as you move your hand got
[1:03:14] a hey and you push yourself off the
[1:03:17] ground
[1:03:21] not
[1:03:22] only walk out to your bed too don't
[1:03:25] leave nobody to pick up your bed too
[1:03:27] walk get up your bed take up your bed
[1:03:28] and walk out with your bed don't expect
[1:03:30] nobody to come and clean up your room
[1:03:32] for you clean up your own room pick up
[1:03:34] your own bed clean up your own stuff
[1:03:37] give the Lord a shout
[1:03:38] in the house. Hallelujah.
[1:03:41] [Applause]
[1:03:45] You say, "Well, brother Bernham, if you
[1:03:47] was going to die in the morning, the
[1:03:49] governor had done sign your debt. What
[1:03:51] have faith can you do?" Faith can sign a
[1:03:53] pardon.
[1:03:55] But fear will never do it. Now, if so,
[1:03:59] if fear is no good at all, has no value
[1:04:02] in it at all, let's discard the thing
[1:04:04] all together. Let's throw out fear.
[1:04:07] Let's have faith and believe God. So
[1:04:09] it's by faith we know God, not by
[1:04:12] knowledge. So we have a bunch of people
[1:04:15] who message folks and they head
[1:04:18] high with knowledge and little faith.
[1:04:22] Their faith so low they can't even
[1:04:23] forgive their brother. Their faith so
[1:04:26] low they renewing theirs as if it's
[1:04:29] their yearly license
[1:04:32] and they missing the payment at all. You
[1:04:34] know they reunite they make sure I
[1:04:37] always talk about the story the old
[1:04:39] mothers always saying things and the
[1:04:41] grandchild say um grandma um why we
[1:04:43] don't talk to them again but it's so
[1:04:46] long I forget
[1:04:50] but from grandmother it passed on to
[1:04:52] child granting grandchild and all they
[1:04:54] know is that we don't talk to them
[1:04:59] the child have no condition no
[1:05:00] connection no arrangement it's just
[1:05:03] spirit And I I see the same thing as
[1:05:05] racism. Racism a bunch of foolishness
[1:05:08] because you're here a certain way. You
[1:05:09] stick you're sticking with your kind.
[1:05:10] What what nonsense is that? That you
[1:05:12] know who that is
[1:05:16] when you check it carefully. You see a
[1:05:18] Chinese person, a white person, a black
[1:05:20] person, Indian person, whatever person,
[1:05:21] you know who really who's that person
[1:05:22] behind there. You seen the house.
[1:05:25] So all that is connected with the house.
[1:05:27] Black house, white house, red house,
[1:05:29] wherever house. But you know the person
[1:05:31] behind that inside or behind that have
[1:05:33] devils, murderers, crooks, liars,
[1:05:36] adulterers, fornicators, haters, malice
[1:05:38] behind all them different color houses.
[1:05:43] Lord, so when you examine it, it's
[1:05:45] foolishness. Because out of one blood,
[1:05:47] God made all flesh.
[1:05:50] [Applause]
[1:05:52] Do you understand that? So because Jesus
[1:05:55] know the names in the book, he can say
[1:05:57] Peter come. Andrew come, this one come
[1:05:59] that. Yes, your family come and all them
[1:06:01] all all the people who you like is not
[1:06:03] who you like is who God forne you before
[1:06:05] the foundation the world
[1:06:07] oh give the Lord a shout in the house
[1:06:14] when I go to them other countries like
[1:06:16] India different places and whatn not I
[1:06:17] don't touch them with the clothes
[1:06:18] whatever they wear you know I see
[1:06:20] brothers think special with barefoot
[1:06:21] barefoot you know tell them how to get
[1:06:23] polish your shoes
[1:06:28] tell them
[1:06:30] We western side western wolf I go and
[1:06:32] tell them yeah how you going to look you
[1:06:36] see
[1:06:38] come s on the ground on the floor we
[1:06:41] tell them sit on the chair we get chairs
[1:06:43] for them that's how we meet them you
[1:06:45] know sisters on this side want them on
[1:06:46] the floor
[1:06:50] but I know what God said out of many
[1:06:53] nations kingdom and tongues so God is
[1:06:56] responsible for that not me not my my
[1:06:59] standard there is a trinidad across the
[1:07:01] there's different countries across the
[1:07:02] different cultures and what god go
[1:07:04] beyond that to call them and they will
[1:07:06] be part of the bride too so we have to
[1:07:08] understand is one god call a people from
[1:07:11] around the world out of every nation out
[1:07:14] of every tongue and that god can't
[1:07:16] lie a people for my name's sake god call
[1:07:21] you sometime and listen sometime it's
[1:07:23] for his sake that he bring you out you
[1:07:25] know because you you just be
[1:07:27] embarrassing sometimes
[1:07:28] So God has to work things off for for
[1:07:30] your sake. He tell Israel you think is
[1:07:32] your behavior and attitude I bringing
[1:07:33] you out. It's for my name's sake.
[1:07:36] I invest too much in this for the enemy
[1:07:39] to laugh and to make mockery my people.
[1:07:42] So I will come now and cleanse you and a
[1:07:45] new heart I will give you. A new spirit
[1:07:47] I'll give you. I'll put my spirit in
[1:07:50] your spirit. Oh glory to God.
[1:07:52] Hallelujah. This message sweet.
[1:07:57] Oh God, this is a good message.
[1:07:59] Hallelujah. A new heart, a new spirit,
[1:08:01] and my spirit. And I will cause you to
[1:08:03] walk in the light of my law. Oh, give
[1:08:06] the Lord a shout. And when God put that
[1:08:08] inside of you, he will set you up as a
[1:08:10] light. And you don't take a light and
[1:08:12] hide it. You don't have a light and
[1:08:14] cover it down. You take a light and put
[1:08:16] it on top. On top. Oh, give the Lord a
[1:08:19] shout. God going to take you and put you
[1:08:21] on top. Let give the Lord a shout in the
[1:08:23] house.
[1:08:24] [Music]
[1:08:26] [Applause]
[1:08:30] Hallelujah. If you understand that, then
[1:08:33] you can't jealous anyone. You can't be
[1:08:36] envious of anyone. Because you know in
[1:08:38] God in God due time, he's going to
[1:08:40] promote you. He's going to Amen. He's
[1:08:43] going to bless you. He going to help
[1:08:45] you.
[1:08:50] You may be seated.
[1:08:51] So God give those senses and they're
[1:08:54] given to you as a gift and it depends
[1:08:56] upon how you what you yield these senses
[1:08:59] to will be the way that your life is
[1:09:02] controlled.
[1:09:06] So if you leave your senses to Facebook
[1:09:10] you whatever you yield your senses to is
[1:09:13] how your life will be controlled. So
[1:09:16] after this service you have to know how
[1:09:18] you're going to treat them senses.
[1:09:23] If you take this as another sermon and
[1:09:25] you just go come and go, well then
[1:09:26] nothing happens. You come back next week
[1:09:28] and afterwards you become a ritualist.
[1:09:32] Somebody to come to church as a ritual.
[1:09:34] It has no value. It means nothing. It
[1:09:36] has nothing upon your life. You don't
[1:09:38] want you want to be like that.
[1:09:41] Uh what guy name? Dayton and Kora. When
[1:09:43] they came out, they didn't ask to come
[1:09:45] out here.
[1:09:49] Everybody's going out, you know. So,
[1:09:50] it's embarrassing if they stay back
[1:09:52] because they had a barber shop. They had
[1:09:53] that that business and thing. They what
[1:09:55] inferior payroll and whatnot. They don't
[1:09:58] know what going to go on. They was
[1:10:00] getting kickbacks.
[1:10:02] They wasn't politic. They were Jewish,
[1:10:04] but they were in politics of thing.
[1:10:06] Where are we going? Where are we going?
[1:10:08] You tell the man the picture when the
[1:10:10] door open. So, they said, "Where are we
[1:10:12] going?" The man don't even know this is
[1:10:14] the house. Yeah. Who put blood blood on
[1:10:17] my door?
[1:10:19] Somebody put blood in the door.
[1:10:22] See? Who put blood on my door? I pay
[1:10:24] bite.
[1:10:27] He don't even know he's protected by the
[1:10:29] blood.
[1:10:30] Where are we going? He he don't know. He
[1:10:32] don't know where where they going. Are
[1:10:34] we going out? That why first time travel
[1:10:36] come they started complaining. Ah Moses
[1:10:39] brought you out in the wilderness to
[1:10:40] die. I just go back to who? To Pharaoh
[1:10:43] because he know you have a role. their
[1:10:44] post to keep them in check.
[1:10:48] So they so that's why when Israel came
[1:10:50] out was a mixed multitude the elect plus
[1:10:54] a real tough generation that God was
[1:10:56] going to kill by giving them 40 more
[1:10:58] years to die out and this die not die
[1:11:01] out of flesh die out and die dead and
[1:11:05] God was seeing their children going over
[1:11:07] because God said God have to keep his
[1:11:09] promise it's not a this generation next
[1:11:11] generation God wasn't playing games with
[1:11:13] that oh give the Lord a shout that's why
[1:11:16] Caleb didn't wait for nobody to talk.
[1:11:18] When it came to division time, he said,
[1:11:20] "Now therefore, give me my mountain."
[1:11:22] Moses spoke about me. I ain't waiting
[1:11:24] for no tribe. I wait for no group. I
[1:11:26] wait for no tabernacle. I wait over this
[1:11:28] fellowship and that fellowship. I come
[1:11:30] in this morning and saying, "Give me my
[1:11:31] mountain." I run a long time now.
[1:11:33] Fighting a long time now. Cutting demons
[1:11:36] and Philite a long time now. And it's
[1:11:38] time we have a revival. It's time we
[1:11:40] have the shout and the voice in the
[1:11:42] camp. Give the Lord a shout in the
[1:11:44] house.
[1:11:46] [Music]
[1:11:46] [Applause]
[1:11:49] Hallelujah.
[1:11:50] So Caleb wasn't waiting for a minister's
[1:11:52] meeting to call for his inheritance. He
[1:11:56] said, "Give me my mountain now." And let
[1:11:58] me tell you something. You see them
[1:11:59] giants up there? I am able along in the
[1:12:02] battle. And if the Lord be with me, I
[1:12:06] will fight and I will expel him out the
[1:12:09] land. And the Bible said, "Kill him
[1:12:10] expel them." You know what I say? Expel.
[1:12:14] be seated.
[1:12:16] When a school or principal expel a
[1:12:18] student you have put throw them out the
[1:12:19] school you know take a three days out
[1:12:21] you know expel you know everybody was
[1:12:24] lying with them not Caleb Caleb expel
[1:12:26] them throw them out cousins aunts
[1:12:29] everybody here knows that Caleb expelled
[1:12:31] them and mother master be Isaac brought
[1:12:34] about the power of that monkey what
[1:12:36] happened on Mount Hebron Abraham buried
[1:12:38] there Syria buried there Joe buried
[1:12:40] there a monkey and David was crowned on
[1:12:43] top of that there give the Lord a shout
[1:12:46] Praise God. You got to conquer before
[1:12:47] you get crowned. Give the Lord a shout.
[1:12:50] You got to be conquer before you get the
[1:12:51] crown. You want a crown? Praise God. You
[1:12:54] don't buy
[1:12:55] that in the marketplace. You don't buy
[1:12:57] that in on Amazon. Grow the Lord some
[1:12:59] praises. You have to conquer and
[1:13:02] overcome. Overcome the lust of the eyes.
[1:13:04] Come on now. Overcome the lust of the
[1:13:05] flesh. Come on now. Overcome the pride
[1:13:07] of life. Overcome the five senses of the
[1:13:10] spirit, conscience and imagination and
[1:13:12] affection and reasoning.
[1:13:15] Imagination is something else, you know.
[1:13:19] Imagine imagine sending your next world
[1:13:22] and if you come out there to hit a
[1:13:23] reality, you're up in heaven. You're up
[1:13:25] there where the air is rare.
[1:13:32] Going up there by imagination when it
[1:13:33] hit reality. So you say, "Whoa, good
[1:13:35] lord." You want to go back in that why
[1:13:38] people go on drugs because the drugs
[1:13:40] keep them in another realm. when they
[1:13:42] come back to reality. I don't want to
[1:13:43] stay here. Stop the world. I want to get
[1:13:46] off. All right. So, God give your senses
[1:13:49] as a gift. And what you see, what you
[1:13:52] hear, what you taste, smell or feel,
[1:13:56] whatever those senses are yielded to,
[1:13:58] they will dominate. You
[1:14:01] know that today.
[1:14:03] And we are grateful to God that we have
[1:14:06] the five senses. But by no means was
[1:14:08] these five senses given to you to guide
[1:14:10] you. They were given to you to
[1:14:12] completely contact and there was given
[1:14:14] you the sixth sense and the sixth sense
[1:14:17] belongs only to the Christian. You
[1:14:19] cannot have faith this six sense until
[1:14:21] you become a Christian is the only way
[1:14:23] that you can ever have any more than the
[1:14:25] five natural senses or the natural
[1:14:28] person. But the sixth sense is better
[1:14:30] known to the Christian as fate. It is
[1:14:33] the one that governs and guides you. It
[1:14:36] is superior to all the other senses. It
[1:14:39] is superior to all the other senses, the
[1:14:42] other five senses. Now, I would say that
[1:14:45] because we receive the six sense that
[1:14:46] the five senses are no more good. Yes,
[1:14:49] they are. Those five senses were given
[1:14:51] to you by God and they are to be used.
[1:14:55] Now, let's go deeper. But when the five
[1:14:57] senses are contrary to the word of God,
[1:15:00] then they are lying. Amen. Your senses
[1:15:05] lying to you,
[1:15:08] not me.
[1:15:10] Hallelujah. Your own senses lying to
[1:15:14] you. Now, the six sense cannot lie.
[1:15:17] Amen. That's a big one.
[1:15:20] The sixth sense cannot lie.
[1:15:24] It's a super sense.
[1:15:27] That is what I want to speak about this
[1:15:29] morning. Super sense. Oh my brother but
[1:15:34] this is a sacred order of the church.
[1:15:36] What order he's talking about? These
[1:15:38] signs shall follow them that believe.
[1:15:42] If they lay hands on the sick they shall
[1:15:44] recover. How the message will want to
[1:15:46] cancel that.
[1:15:48] These signs we just talking talking we
[1:15:51] just we we just talk this. That what the
[1:15:53] Pharisees was, you know, they talk as
[1:15:55] long gong hats, ceremonial and
[1:15:58] everything else. And Jesus come and bust
[1:16:00] that by preaching, teaching and with
[1:16:03] sign and wonders. And Bram said his
[1:16:05] ministry exposed them. It was the
[1:16:08] ministry of Jesus Christ. And when the
[1:16:10] ministry of Jesus Christ returns, it
[1:16:12] will expose those who don't have that.
[1:16:15] All right. Now, watch here. The first
[1:16:16] thing you must do is surrender yourself
[1:16:19] entirely to Christ. Surrender your mind
[1:16:22] to his word. Listen to what words he's
[1:16:24] saying. And I want you to work with me
[1:16:26] with this. Lord, I won't act upon my own
[1:16:30] feelings, upon my own thoughts. I will
[1:16:33] act upon your word. This is what you
[1:16:36] have to speak. That you're not going to
[1:16:39] act upon your feelings. You're going to
[1:16:41] act upon your thoughts. You're going to
[1:16:42] act upon the word. I'll have no control
[1:16:45] of my thoughts concerning it. I will act
[1:16:47] upon your word. Now, get that straight.
[1:16:49] Now, you're not going to go down and
[1:16:51] say, "Well, I've lost my healing." If
[1:16:53] you do, brother, it will be worse than
[1:16:54] ever if you ever make this committal.
[1:16:57] You have to stand right now. Remember,
[1:16:59] just like coming to church, you are
[1:17:00] supposed to make a committal. Say,
[1:17:02] "Lord, God of heaven, I'll stand by your
[1:17:04] word. So, help me till the last drop of
[1:17:06] blood left my body or bread." You
[1:17:08] believe when your baby passed through
[1:17:09] the line, it's going to be healed.
[1:17:10] Sister, you do that. Frankly, it's
[1:17:13] already healed. But I want you to pass
[1:17:15] through the line anyhow. It's healed a
[1:17:17] while ago. I want you to come through so
[1:17:20] you will follow the regular. So you
[1:17:21] already know the baby heal. Baby was
[1:17:23] sick. You say already healed already.
[1:17:25] But I still want you to pass through the
[1:17:26] line. Now all of you that wants to make
[1:17:28] this committal, put your hand on your
[1:17:30] heart like this. And those who are
[1:17:32] standing here, those who cannot lay your
[1:17:34] hands on there, raise up your hand and
[1:17:37] say now you now commit yourself to God.
[1:17:40] And from this time hence, you believe
[1:17:42] that you are healed by the power of
[1:17:44] almighty God. You will do that.
[1:17:48] So all of this but Ram was teaching the
[1:17:50] people. He was just saying, "Come, let
[1:17:52] me pray for you. Let me pray for you.
[1:17:53] Let me pray for you." No, he was
[1:17:55] teaching them. Because you see, not only
[1:17:57] must you get your healing, but you have
[1:17:59] to keep your healing, too.
[1:18:01] You see, just as faith get the devil and
[1:18:03] sickness away from you, unbelief will
[1:18:05] bring it back right back. I I'll say it
[1:18:07] again. Just as faith got your heal push
[1:18:10] it away from you, your unbelief will
[1:18:12] bring it right back to you. Amen. Amen.
[1:18:16] Now, the only thing a minister can do is
[1:18:17] to preach the gospel, tell you the
[1:18:19] truth. You believe it, accept it, act
[1:18:21] upon your confession, go out and say
[1:18:23] you're well. Believe you're well. Act
[1:18:25] like you are. You say, "But man, should
[1:18:27] I do that before?" You never feel
[1:18:30] nothing. In other words, he saying
[1:18:32] before I start to feel, you speak, you
[1:18:34] confess, you accept, you acknowledge, I
[1:18:37] am healed. Praise God. He said Jesus
[1:18:40] never said, "You're not saved by
[1:18:42] feeling. The devil can beat you around
[1:18:44] every stop in the country saying it's by
[1:18:46] your feelings. I'm not saved because I
[1:18:48] feel like I'm saved. I'm saved because
[1:18:50] God would say I'm saved.
[1:18:54] Are you ready for some more? Listen, the
[1:18:56] word of God will defeat the devil any
[1:18:58] place, anytime, anytime, under any
[1:19:00] condition. And when Jesus was here on
[1:19:02] the earth, the father was in him. God
[1:19:04] was in Christ reconciled the world to
[1:19:05] himself. We believe that all the fine
[1:19:07] qualities that was in the father was in
[1:19:09] him. And when he met Satan, look how he
[1:19:10] did. He brought it into your reach.
[1:19:13] Yours. He never used his great gift. He
[1:19:16] said, "It is written." It is written.
[1:19:18] And it is also written. Now, if you're
[1:19:20] not in the word, how you going to know
[1:19:22] what is written to fight that devil? How
[1:19:25] you will know who you're fighting? You
[1:19:28] will get licks right through. Oh, praise
[1:19:30] the name of the Lord. Praise God. Do you
[1:19:31] believe that? So, the word of God is a
[1:19:33] seed. You believe that? Accept it in
[1:19:35] your heart and water it. Testify of it.
[1:19:38] Take it as your own personal need and
[1:19:40] God will bring it to pass. Hallelujah.
[1:19:43] God, I'm receiving this word today. I
[1:19:46] have to deal with my senses. Hallelujah.
[1:19:48] I have to get over my senses.
[1:19:50] Hallelujah. So the church going to be
[1:19:53] under five senses and the bride will be
[1:19:55] under the six sense. Give the Lord some
[1:19:57] praises. So the prophet he can turn our
[1:20:00] hearts back to that six sense which is
[1:20:02] the fate of the fathers. Is that right?
[1:20:05] So 2 Peter 1:4-7 is the bride. Faith and
[1:20:08] virtue and knowledge. Those seven steps
[1:20:10] there going up to God. That's the bride.
[1:20:13] Isn't that right? And second Timothy 3
[1:20:15] is the church. Who are they? Heady,
[1:20:17] highminded, lovers of pleasures more
[1:20:19] than lovers of God, truth breakers,
[1:20:20] false accusers, all that is flesh.
[1:20:23] Hallelujah. Give the Lord some praises.
[1:20:25] All of this cannal mind in the message
[1:20:27] walking with the books and the tapes.
[1:20:29] Give the Lord some praises. Right with
[1:20:30] me now. Right with me now. Hallelujah.
[1:20:34] Hallelujah. And of course their
[1:20:36] ministers going to be Matthew 24:24 to
[1:20:38] the church and Ephesians 4 to the bride
[1:20:41] for anointed to go them have a gift to
[1:20:43] the church because the church have ears
[1:20:45] and they want to hear some new
[1:20:46] revelations things that never in the
[1:20:47] word and the the ears speak up. They're
[1:20:51] like spock pointed ears pointed ears
[1:20:55] like that. So and they wait to hear the
[1:20:57] next set of revelation. So the church
[1:21:00] would be operating in the realm of the
[1:21:01] five senses.
[1:21:03] Where are you at? What is the realm you
[1:21:06] are living in and operating in? But you
[1:21:08] don't like me. Is that right? But then
[1:21:10] maybe God will love you too. God like
[1:21:12] you too. It's not my liking. God love
[1:21:15] you. But he love you if you want to come
[1:21:17] into his word. He love you as you are.
[1:21:19] He love you to be to see you change and
[1:21:21] transform. God tolerates foolishness.
[1:21:24] That's why prophet talk about an Safra
[1:21:26] that is going to repeat. They were if
[1:21:28] you examine that case, you will see how
[1:21:30] terrible they were because they could
[1:21:33] have said, "I'm giving the church $10,
[1:21:36] $15, $20."
[1:21:38] That is honesty. They sell and and is
[1:21:41] this all? She said, "Yes, he lied."
[1:21:44] Because I said, "No, this is not all.
[1:21:45] You know, because I put something to
[1:21:46] build house. I give some to my aunt and
[1:21:48] my or whatever." That's all. And that
[1:21:51] that's cool. It's your money. It's
[1:21:53] yours. Wealth is whatever it is. But the
[1:21:55] man looked at Peter and said that is
[1:21:57] all. He said enlighten man lie to the
[1:22:00] Holy Ghost. He didn't come to lie to the
[1:22:03] Holy Ghost intentionally. But he was
[1:22:05] lying all the time. That wasn't the
[1:22:07] first lie. Now that was the capitalized.
[1:22:10] He was a liar. And the Bible said put
[1:22:13] away lying. Okay. The Lord has shout in
[1:22:15] the house. They were brothers and sister
[1:22:18] Safira coming to church every Sunday.
[1:22:24] But they had stuff they didn't put away
[1:22:26] and one of those stuff was lying.
[1:22:30] Note the one I well he said call your
[1:22:32] husband. She said I have none. He said
[1:22:33] he had five living which is not yours.
[1:22:36] This you said truly you see the
[1:22:38] difference. She terrible condition no
[1:22:41] but she's speaking truth and Jesus bear
[1:22:43] record of that. Oh the Lord I shout in
[1:22:47] so much that he say I that speak unto
[1:22:49] you am he. The Messiah talking about it
[1:22:52] living. It's present tense. It's alive.
[1:22:54] It's here. Messiah is on earth now. I
[1:22:57] that speaking to you, I'm here. Oh,
[1:23:00] praise the name of the Lord. So, the
[1:23:02] church will be operating in the realm of
[1:23:03] the five senses, imagination, reason,
[1:23:05] affection, conscious, memory, but the
[1:23:07] bride will be operating under the realm
[1:23:09] of the six sense which is fate. Amen.
[1:23:13] Praise God. Colossians 3, I want to read
[1:23:15] this from verse two. Colossians 3, it
[1:23:18] says, "Set your affections on things
[1:23:19] above, not on things on the earth." And
[1:23:22] you know the devil have everything to
[1:23:23] offer on the internet. Everything offers
[1:23:26] the latest. That's putting people and
[1:23:29] the heart a better car, a better house,
[1:23:31] a better land, a better cut, a better
[1:23:32] hole, a better fork, a better split, a
[1:23:34] better spoon.
[1:23:37] That's the devil. But he set your
[1:23:40] affections on things above. People go
[1:23:43] and get America and
[1:23:45] lo them.
[1:23:47] Forget it. That light out the life I see
[1:23:50] and out the Christianity light too
[1:23:52] bright and that is just natural things.
[1:23:55] Jesus got the offer all these things and
[1:23:57] minds to give whoever I want. Just bow
[1:24:00] down and worship. A lot of these singers
[1:24:03] and pe singers and musician make
[1:24:04] covenant with the devil to be rich
[1:24:07] temporarily.
[1:24:11] After 30 years it can't go good.
[1:24:15] Amen. Hollywood stars afterwards bur the
[1:24:17] dead but they have 50 movies. They have
[1:24:21] 100 movies. Who cares about the movies
[1:24:22] they gone? Where they going? Heaven or
[1:24:24] hell?
[1:24:29] So when David expressed to God about the
[1:24:31] man spreading like a b tree and God
[1:24:33] asked the question, have you considered
[1:24:35] the end?
[1:24:36] All the games people playing in this
[1:24:38] message, all the game people playing in
[1:24:40] church, there's an end to that, you
[1:24:41] know. Amen.
[1:24:44] Hallelujah.
[1:24:47] The Bible says they all heard the same
[1:24:49] rock, all hear the same sermon. But with
[1:24:51] many of them, God was not pleased. He
[1:24:53] killed 10,000 with this, he with that.
[1:24:55] God was not pleased. And I say this way,
[1:24:57] the same people that God brought out, he
[1:24:59] killed them.
[1:25:02] God brought me out. He brought me out.
[1:25:04] Hallelujah. Glory glory. Yeah. You know,
[1:25:08] same God. You know, you're not serving
[1:25:11] the church. You're not serving me.
[1:25:13] You're not serving the message. You come
[1:25:15] to serve the living God.
[1:25:19] They did not know that God. Moses met
[1:25:21] that God. Moses encountered that God.
[1:25:24] Moses asked a question. He know what he
[1:25:25] had to deal with. He said, "God, when I
[1:25:27] go down there, what who shall I send
[1:25:29] me?"
[1:25:31] But them people are taking that. So God
[1:25:33] send me. Send who? Who are you? You put
[1:25:35] might put some licks in your You can't
[1:25:37] just go there and tell them God send
[1:25:38] you. Amen. Moses is stupid. Moses said,
[1:25:41] "God, what what what I tell you? Tell
[1:25:42] them I am."
[1:25:45] Go and tell them I am sent. And Moses
[1:25:47] went down do miracles. They saw the
[1:25:49] miracles but they didn't see God. They
[1:25:52] saw the flies and the plagues but I
[1:25:54] can't believe but they didn't see God.
[1:25:56] God said bring them down to the
[1:25:57] mountain. That I will reveal myself to
[1:26:00] them. And then when God came on the
[1:26:02] mountain, the monks had a shake. Now you
[1:26:04] know that it's not a brush shaking or a
[1:26:06] broom or some kind of tree shaking. The
[1:26:08] whole mouth had to shake. The people
[1:26:09] said don't let God speak. Let Moses
[1:26:12] speak because when God start to rock
[1:26:14] that mountain, man strip you man have
[1:26:16] nothing to say. You can't party time
[1:26:18] there. You can't feel the party when God
[1:26:20] rocking that mountain. You know when
[1:26:21] pillar of fire on top of there
[1:26:29] they fighting. Man need bucking. Then
[1:26:33] Moses had to go for the ten
[1:26:34] commandments. Word
[1:26:36] spending a long time up there. Somebody
[1:26:39] got a revelation. Yeah. Why Moses
[1:26:41] spending? No.
[1:26:44] Suppose he did.
[1:26:46] Now you see that is time eyes
[1:26:51] observation. They're not thinking this
[1:26:54] man sent by God brought two million
[1:26:57] people out of Egypt passes through a Red
[1:26:59] Sea. Some clong some intellectual idiot
[1:27:02] stand up and say suppose he dead.
[1:27:06] Aaron,
[1:27:08] make us our God.
[1:27:15] Aaron, you know the skills of the high
[1:27:17] priest. Make us a god. A golden calf.
[1:27:22] And that was a fresh
[1:27:25] re why we didn't think about that
[1:27:27] before.
[1:27:31] Hallelujah. That come fresh. Amen.
[1:27:35] I see I see light when I see that gold
[1:27:37] and calf.
[1:27:40] Gather the gold from the people and them
[1:27:42] mixing gold. Yes. And Aaron heart heavy
[1:27:45] heavy heavy cuz he know better than you.
[1:27:48] But then this man have a bigger mouth
[1:27:51] and he's taller and bolder. And in those
[1:27:54] days the bigger mouth shout the bigger
[1:27:56] mouth the bigger
[1:27:58] influencer. didn't have that terminology
[1:28:00] back there. But Coral and they were
[1:28:02] influencers.
[1:28:06] That were they were influencers.
[1:28:08] When Moses do come down party, carnival
[1:28:13] wasn't a a midnight thing, you know. Was
[1:28:16] it was a couple of day celebration. When
[1:28:18] Moses come down, you see I hear noise.
[1:28:21] What is that revalry? Them people
[1:28:24] partying. Now listen, a few days away,
[1:28:26] they get licks and Pharaoh be in the
[1:28:28] middle. Yes. You see what liberty is? I
[1:28:32] want my freedom. My mother give me my
[1:28:34] back. Father give me my back. When I
[1:28:36] leave home, I want my freedom. Freedom
[1:28:38] of a cost. You know,
[1:28:40] they were free to do whatever they want
[1:28:44] doing the wrong thing. We know what
[1:28:45] happened. God killed some of them. Moses
[1:28:48] who lord side come towards me cuz God
[1:28:50] say I will kill all of them you know and
[1:28:52] start a new generation you know. And
[1:28:54] then Moses had a plea for them. Yes.
[1:28:57] Because he studying how the other kings
[1:28:58] will see it. God killed them because he
[1:29:00] couldn't bring them out. He couldn't
[1:29:02] bring them through. For your name's
[1:29:04] sake. For your name's sake. Not for dear
[1:29:07] sake. For your name's sake. You can't
[1:29:09] let this message be corrupted where we
[1:29:11] have no evidence, no vindication, no
[1:29:13] confirmation. For your name's sake. Send
[1:29:15] fire. For your name's sake. Send on the
[1:29:18] power. For your name's sake.
[1:29:22] To vindicate Malachi 4. to vindicate. He
[1:29:25] have turned the hearts of the children
[1:29:27] back to the faith of the fathers because
[1:29:28] I'm a witness that the six sense is
[1:29:31] resident and the six sense is living in
[1:29:33] me. Give the Lord some praises. That is
[1:29:35] what we have to come to. The faith of
[1:29:38] the fathers. It was more than talk.
[1:29:43] Set your affections on things above, not
[1:29:46] on things on the earth. For ye are dead
[1:29:48] and your life is hidden. Christ in God.
[1:29:51] And when Christ who is our life shall
[1:29:53] appear, then shall ye also appear with
[1:29:55] him in glory. Listen to
[1:29:58] this. Mortify therefore your members,
[1:30:01] which is your body, which are upon the
[1:30:03] earth, fornication, uncleanness,
[1:30:06] inordinate affection, evil concussence,
[1:30:09] and covetousness, which is adultery. For
[1:30:11] which things sake the wrath of God
[1:30:14] cometh on the chin of disobedience. This
[1:30:16] is after coming to the message. You want
[1:30:18] to act rebellious. You don't want to
[1:30:19] follow through with the word. You don't
[1:30:21] want to you don't want to follow with
[1:30:22] the order of spirit then you in here
[1:30:25] become a child of rebellion that will be
[1:30:27] judged. So then a rebellious child is
[1:30:29] like witchcraft and judgment is upon
[1:30:30] that person. Amen.
[1:30:34] For which things sake the wrath of God
[1:30:36] cometh on the children of disobedience
[1:30:38] in which ye also walk some time when you
[1:30:43] lived in them. He's going deeper. But
[1:30:46] now you also put off these. Paul is
[1:30:49] speaking to the church. I'm speaking to
[1:30:51] you this morning. Put off these anger,
[1:30:54] wrath, malice, blasphemy, filthy
[1:30:58] communications out of your mouth. Lie
[1:31:01] not one to another. Seeing you have put
[1:31:04] off the old man with his deeds. Here
[1:31:07] come the old man again. He's not good.
[1:31:11] You had to put him off. And put and have
[1:31:14] put on the new man. So the old man had
[1:31:17] to go out. The new man come in, which is
[1:31:20] renewed in knowledge after the image of
[1:31:23] him that created him. Where there is
[1:31:25] neither Greek nor Jew, circumcision nor
[1:31:27] uncircumcision, barbarian, skintian,
[1:31:29] bond nor free, but Christ is all in all.
[1:31:32] Put on
[1:31:33] therefore as the elect of God, holy and
[1:31:38] beloved, powers of mercies, kindness,
[1:31:41] homalous of mind, meekness,
[1:31:43] longsuffering. Amen. Amen. This is the
[1:31:46] elect we're talking about. You know,
[1:31:48] elect have to be able to do this.
[1:31:50] Forbearing one another and forgiving one
[1:31:53] another. If any man have a quarrel
[1:31:56] against any, even as Christ forgive you,
[1:31:58] so also do ye. And then he said, above
[1:32:01] all things, these things put on charity,
[1:32:04] which is the bond of perfectness.
[1:32:06] And you heard on the tape I preached
[1:32:08] that all these attributes of charity is
[1:32:10] to live here on this side. Yes. Nobody
[1:32:12] can tell me brother I love you on the
[1:32:14] other side. Liar.
[1:32:16] Hallelujah. You got to love on this
[1:32:18] side. You got to be kind. Char suffered
[1:32:20] long and is kind. Does not puffed up.
[1:32:22] Isn't easily provoked because across the
[1:32:25] is perfect. So you can't talk about the
[1:32:27] other side. It's here. You have to
[1:32:29] exercise love. It's here. You have to
[1:32:30] exercise patience. It's here. You have
[1:32:32] to forgive. It's here. You have to hug
[1:32:34] your brother and hug your sister and
[1:32:36] pray for your brother and pray for your
[1:32:37] sister. It's here. You have to do them
[1:32:38] things.
[1:32:40] Hallelujah.
[1:32:42] Amen.
[1:32:44] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:32:46] You get it now? Amen. The elect of God
[1:32:49] having bows of mercies and compassions.
[1:32:51] I know um we said it before, but Abraham
[1:32:54] talk about uh when looking at the seals
[1:32:57] and he saw those crying for judgment.
[1:32:59] How long Lord? How long? He said that
[1:33:00] can't be the bride. That's the Jews
[1:33:03] crying for judgment. He said the bride
[1:33:05] don't cry for that. Amen.
[1:33:08] So I cannot see somebody that have a
[1:33:10] revelation of being justified as if they
[1:33:11] never did it holding ought against
[1:33:13] anybody else. They have no revelation be
[1:33:15] justified. They are self-righteous and
[1:33:17] religious. They have no revelation of
[1:33:19] that because if you are forgiven because
[1:33:21] that's what the Bible just talk about
[1:33:23] the parable you know the man was guilty
[1:33:25] he was in jail and then he came out and
[1:33:27] the man forgive him and what not and
[1:33:29] afterwards he locked somebody neck for a
[1:33:30] little bit of money. Yeah, people was
[1:33:32] dis that was despicable because you get
[1:33:35] forgiven for $10,000 and somebody have
[1:33:37] $10 for you and you making $1 million
[1:33:40] and they carry on your foolishness
[1:33:41] afterwards back to the jail.
[1:33:44] Hallelujah. Jesus showing the quality of
[1:33:47] behavior and attitude. And when he said
[1:33:49] love your neighbor, they were who is my
[1:33:51] neighbor? He had to go in a parable, a
[1:33:52] story. I have a hidden mystery inside
[1:33:55] that story. man walking on the street
[1:33:57] and sick and everything else and this
[1:33:59] long dress passer this passing but the
[1:34:02] brother so and so pass him everybody
[1:34:03] passes him message
[1:34:06] until a Samaritan saw the man booked the
[1:34:08] man in the hotel and then straighten say
[1:34:10] listen if you have any bill I'll pay for
[1:34:11] this man who's your neighbor then
[1:34:16] so they know who the neighbor is in the
[1:34:17] message I am your neighbor
[1:34:22] say I'm your neighbor Amen.
[1:34:25] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. But you of the
[1:34:27] word of the word. You're helping your
[1:34:29] neighbor. Come and show me which part
[1:34:31] I'm supposed to get back on the word.
[1:34:33] You see me going down the road and you
[1:34:34] you see he off. Tell anybody. He off. He
[1:34:36] off. Way off. He off the highway. He on
[1:34:39] his shoulder.
[1:34:41] And that is why we have to encourage one
[1:34:43] another to stay on that path because God
[1:34:46] has vindicate truth. You know, God has
[1:34:48] vindicate the right thing. You know, God
[1:34:51] has always do that. You know, I don't
[1:34:52] care what you're going through right
[1:34:53] now. If you stay with God, God will
[1:34:55] stand with you.
[1:34:58] All right, let's go.
[1:35:01] So, but when the battle on earth
[1:35:02] started, the the battle to rage, the
[1:35:06] battleground started in the human mind.
[1:35:08] There's where the battle starts. The
[1:35:10] human mind was chosen because here the
[1:35:12] reason decisions are made from the mind.
[1:35:16] You could choose to love, you could
[1:35:17] choose to hate, you could choose to
[1:35:19] forgive, or you could choose who you
[1:35:20] ought. You could choose to steal back
[1:35:21] dig up in the past like but but I'm
[1:35:23] talking about somebody plant a seed. You
[1:35:25] plant a seed every morning you're
[1:35:26] digging up the seed looking growing. It
[1:35:27] will not grow. You have to be able to
[1:35:30] commit it to the ground and cover it up
[1:35:32] and turn your back. Let rain fall. Let
[1:35:34] the sunshine. It will spring forth. And
[1:35:37] that's the same thing with the word of
[1:35:38] God. You can't dig up, dig up, dig up.
[1:35:40] No, you have to believe that this
[1:35:42] service here will deal with your senses
[1:35:44] because you have been judging things
[1:35:45] through your senses and your feeling.
[1:35:46] You operate with your children through
[1:35:48] your senses and feeling. That is not how
[1:35:49] God want you to be with your children.
[1:35:51] That not righteous judgment. You have to
[1:35:53] judge by the word.
[1:35:56] You have to judge things by the word.
[1:36:00] This is not as you pass pass.
[1:36:03] You said it in the Bible. You ever see
[1:36:06] God get anybody like that? He pass.
[1:36:09] Nobody see nobody
[1:36:11] pass. God didn't get David a pass. He
[1:36:14] didn't give Abraham a pass. He didn't
[1:36:16] give Solomon a pass. None of them you
[1:36:18] give a pass. What about Adam? Firstborn
[1:36:23] son. The day you eat there of that day
[1:36:25] you die. Oh God. Oh God. I know I said
[1:36:27] it but oh God it will hurt my heart too
[1:36:28] much. Oh God.
[1:36:30] Adam. That's how we as judge. That is
[1:36:34] son. Oh God. Oh kick him
[1:36:37] out. Not God. You know he told him the
[1:36:40] day you eat that day you die. To be God.
[1:36:44] You have to keep his word. Amen. We have
[1:36:47] to become like God. We have to love the
[1:36:49] word more than anything else. You have
[1:36:51] to love this thing like more than any
[1:36:54] else. God first. Your family second and
[1:36:57] you are last. You love God. You love the
[1:37:01] word. You love the cause. You love his
[1:37:03] people. You love the things of God. You
[1:37:06] speak it.
[1:37:08] [Applause]
[1:37:08] [Music]
[1:37:10] Is that some people love Christmas?
[1:37:14] Yes, they love the songs. They love
[1:37:16] painting, changing
[1:37:19] curtains. I remember a long time my
[1:37:22] mother house, we used to change the what
[1:37:24] you call it again on the
[1:37:27] ground. Night before
[1:37:31] Christmas when you get up on Christmas
[1:37:33] morning, Christmas, you smell
[1:37:36] that you're baking before night. the
[1:37:39] baking Christmas. Christmas day, you're
[1:37:42] dead tired.
[1:37:45] Dead tired. What on earth is this about?
[1:37:49] But that was the Catholic culture.
[1:37:52] Christmas. Some people like carnival.
[1:37:53] They can't wait to come. Christmas over
[1:37:55] and carnival in their body
[1:37:59] already. And they talking it, you know.
[1:38:01] They say, "I love Christmas. I love
[1:38:03] listen. They giving you a chair. They
[1:38:04] giving you a drink. In fact, after
[1:38:06] Christmas, don't come back in front of
[1:38:07] the house looking for that.
[1:38:09] Wrong anointing, wrong season, wrong
[1:38:10] time and see Christmas time. Oh, I know
[1:38:13] because we used to do it. You just go by
[1:38:15] house merry Christmas happy. You know
[1:38:18] people going to serve something. You
[1:38:20] can't go that after that time. That
[1:38:21] anointing leave them back to normal
[1:38:23] again. You know, normal normal normal.
[1:38:26] You get what I'm saying?
[1:38:29] So you have to be able to express your
[1:38:32] love for God. Your love for the word. It
[1:38:35] will come part of you. You can't wait to
[1:38:38] be in service. You can't wait to come to
[1:38:40] church. You can't wait for the prayer
[1:38:43] meeting. You can't wait to worship God.
[1:38:45] You have to speak it. If you don't speak
[1:38:48] it, you're coming here.
[1:38:49] [Applause]
[1:38:52] But when you in speaking it and in that
[1:38:54] atmosphere when you come here. Oh, glory
[1:38:56] to God. Hallelujah. Thank you,
[1:38:59] Jesus. What you doing? You're in the
[1:39:01] spirit. You have expectation. You're
[1:39:04] expressing it by your mouth. You have to
[1:39:06] speak it like how God spoke it. He said,
[1:39:09] "Let there be light am all the
[1:39:10] darkness." He didn't care how long light
[1:39:12] was coming, but he knew light was going
[1:39:14] to come because it came out of his
[1:39:16] mouth. I love the Lord. He heard my
[1:39:19] voice. He answered my prayer. I wait
[1:39:22] patiently upon the Lord. My soul waited
[1:39:25] upon God. Oh, as the heart plant after
[1:39:28] the water broke, David was expressing it
[1:39:30] in song, expressing it in poems. So my
[1:39:33] soul thirst after the living God. God is
[1:39:36] hearing that. The angels is hearing
[1:39:38] that. And the devil is hearing that. Oh,
[1:39:40] the Lord has shouted the house.
[1:39:43] [Music]
[1:39:45] [Applause]
[1:39:51] Express how your faith is growing.
[1:39:56] Some people express how their faith
[1:39:58] weak. Their faith weak because their
[1:40:00] senses active and alive. You're feeding
[1:40:03] the senses like a man came to Indian
[1:40:05] brother and saying have two goat dogs a
[1:40:08] black dog and a white dog and they
[1:40:09] fighting one another. He said who does
[1:40:12] win? He say which one I feed.
[1:40:18] You feeding that dog with with with
[1:40:22] television and with everything Hollywood
[1:40:24] have to offer. You feeding that dog with
[1:40:26] the world and things of the world. We
[1:40:27] expect dog that dog must grow. So when
[1:40:30] you saying you come you when you saying
[1:40:32] in church quiet nobody grew
[1:40:36] is that big dog you have there if you
[1:40:38] starve that dog and feed the faith dog
[1:40:41] it's a different thing all together
[1:40:45] when that that dog you say shut up he
[1:40:48] has to shut up because your faith is
[1:40:50] growing you have to believe your faith
[1:40:52] could grow how many believe your faith
[1:40:54] could grow
[1:40:56] [Applause]
[1:40:59] hallelujah Amen.
[1:41:01] We will test that feeling. You have
[1:41:02] faith grow. I have a testimony and pass
[1:41:05] the microphone to you say give us a
[1:41:07] testimony how your faith
[1:41:11] growing look the bathroom look around
[1:41:15] heading for the exit because you have to
[1:41:17] be able to give a testimony.
[1:41:20] Amen.
[1:41:22] So decisions are made in the mind, the
[1:41:25] head, there is where Satan meets you and
[1:41:29] decisions because God made man that way.
[1:41:33] So before you could be renewed in your
[1:41:35] mind and the title is be renewed in the
[1:41:37] spirit of your mind. Amen. Having a new
[1:41:40] outlook because if we could get your
[1:41:42] outlook to shift from you there some
[1:41:45] people they are on
[1:41:47] theirel. They wouldn't say that you
[1:41:49] don't have a sign m I am on me but you
[1:41:51] live that
[1:41:54] because if you live higher than where
[1:41:55] you are because of you seeing a greater
[1:41:58] picture a higher picture as I say don't
[1:42:01] live above the animals live lower than
[1:42:03] the angels
[1:42:05] go make you no like animal God want you
[1:42:08] to be angelic God want you to be in the
[1:42:10] spirit God want you walk as a son God
[1:42:12] want you to walk responsible
[1:42:14] why you think God called that man with
[1:42:16] the talent buried a wicked
[1:42:18] Amen. He had one and he buried it. He
[1:42:23] was lazy.
[1:42:25] A lazy man. The best he could do is keep
[1:42:28] it safe. God said, "But I want added to
[1:42:30] that. I want interest." You got to put
[1:42:32] in the bank. Even if they give 1% now
[1:42:35] almost half percent and whatnot is
[1:42:36] ridiculous. But the point about is not
[1:42:38] the bank is the issue. The the issue is
[1:42:40] God want productivity.
[1:42:43] That why people say add not subtract.
[1:42:45] Add to your faith virtue and knowledge
[1:42:46] and temperance. God want you to grow.
[1:42:48] God want you to prosper. God want you to
[1:42:50] produce fruit. God don't want you
[1:42:52] hanging like a tree and nothing coming
[1:42:53] forth. You have to bring forth.
[1:42:58] We were sent to produce something. He
[1:43:00] said what we see should make a church
[1:43:03] that would make a revival. We have to do
[1:43:05] something with what God has given us.
[1:43:08] We can't wait until somebody else do it.
[1:43:10] We have to see our responsibility. We
[1:43:12] have to make a church. 10 thunders going
[1:43:16] to be a manifestation also. They want to
[1:43:19] mystify it but it's going to be a
[1:43:20] manifestation. They will say the seven
[1:43:22] thunders that are not written is being
[1:43:25] manifested. Oh give the Lord a shout.
[1:43:28] And if it's mysteries Christ is the
[1:43:30] mystery of God revealed. Then all the
[1:43:33] revelation that come into our
[1:43:35] manifestation have to reveal Jesus
[1:43:37] Christ. And he's the same yesterday,
[1:43:39] today and forever. Same power, same
[1:43:41] signs, same wonders, same
[1:43:46] miracles. What you're saying the days of
[1:43:48] the apostles is here. We going back to
[1:43:51] the days of the apostles. Super church,
[1:43:53] super race as we near the headstone. We
[1:43:56] be more radical like than brother Bam
[1:43:58] because he was one man. But there's a
[1:44:00] many membered pride around the world.
[1:44:02] Give the Lord a shout. There'll be one
[1:44:04] more ride. I'll ride this trail once
[1:44:07] more. Oh, give the Lord a shout. Oh,
[1:44:08] glory to God. Hallelujah.
[1:44:11] The Holy Ghost, the white horse rider,
[1:44:17] [Applause]
[1:44:23] so my objective today is to rock your
[1:44:24] senses, to rock you off your five senses
[1:44:28] and get you back into the sense of
[1:44:29] faith. Because the sense of faith is
[1:44:31] what make them see Jesus go up and went
[1:44:33] in the upper room praising God
[1:44:35] continually. They wasn't praising God
[1:44:37] for him to come back. They were praising
[1:44:38] God for the promise. You shall receive
[1:44:40] power after the Holy Ghost come upon
[1:44:43] you. That is the promise of the father.
[1:44:45] And if the father give you that promise,
[1:44:47] expect it. Look for it. Glory to God to
[1:44:51] go greater or your sickness to go
[1:44:52] greater or your tumor to go greater. Oh,
[1:44:55] glory to God. Depression to go greater.
[1:44:57] That's not the promise. It's the Holy
[1:44:59] Ghost to come upon you. God could heal
[1:45:01] you today from every sickness, every
[1:45:02] disease.
[1:45:06] My Bible tell me he healed all manner of
[1:45:09] sickness, all manner of disease. He had
[1:45:11] question of his diabetes, headache, high
[1:45:13] blood pressure,
[1:45:15] nothing. As it come, he deal with it.
[1:45:18] Give the Lord a shout. come deal
[1:45:20] with it. Death come with it. Lane come
[1:45:22] deal with it. Blind come deal with
[1:45:25] it. We going to deal with it. Oh, give
[1:45:28] the Lord a shout.
[1:45:32] [Applause]
[1:45:33] [Music]
[1:45:38] [Applause]
[1:45:40] Hallelujah.
[1:45:43] Hallelujah.
[1:45:46] Your mind accepts the life which is the
[1:45:47] word of God. No. Dead brings a life.
[1:45:50] Just your thought doesn't do it. Your
[1:45:52] thought doesn't do it. But the word of
[1:45:54] God brought in the channel of your
[1:45:56] thought. So what do you come here to get
[1:45:59] to hear the word? Faith come by hearing.
[1:46:01] Amen. and hearing by the word. So when
[1:46:04] you hear the word, it lifts you. It
[1:46:07] inspires you. Whatever condition you're
[1:46:09] in, it lifts you up.
[1:46:12] Amen. What that does, it give you faith.
[1:46:16] Even if it's faith for this hour here,
[1:46:18] even it's faith for two hours here, but
[1:46:20] the time that you're under this word, it
[1:46:22] giving you faith. It increasing your
[1:46:25] faith. It growing your faith. Is what
[1:46:28] you do after is what will make that
[1:46:29] faith explode.
[1:46:31] [Applause]
[1:46:35] Hallelujah. So I'm not point you to the
[1:46:37] faith of the preacher. Some people only
[1:46:39] have faith in the in the preacher and
[1:46:40] pastor. They figure that they reach
[1:46:41] because the pastor is the man of the
[1:46:43] hour. And if he dead, he's a dead man in
[1:46:46] the hour.
[1:46:49] Makes no sense. Your faith can't be in a
[1:46:52] man. Your faith have to be in the word.
[1:46:55] In other words, if God send a donkey to
[1:46:57] speak it, you're taking the word. Leave
[1:46:59] the donkey alone, but take the word.
[1:47:02] [Applause]
[1:47:04] Do you get it now?
[1:47:07] Say, but you're rough. But you're rough.
[1:47:10] Hallelujah. I don't know how you going
[1:47:12] to handle Jesus. When Jesus come to the
[1:47:14] temple and when he see them gambling
[1:47:16] them fell kind of naturally gambling all
[1:47:18] they see is loot and more loot. Money
[1:47:21] and more money. The M playing Mark
[1:47:23] playing
[1:47:24] play lotto wherever it is they playing
[1:47:27] inside. You take a a sudden beat
[1:47:30] overturn the tables. They say Jesus
[1:47:32] going
[1:47:33] violent report next week. Pastor going
[1:47:37] violent wreck the whole temple. He said
[1:47:40] my father's house shall be called a
[1:47:41] house of prayer which make it a thieves.
[1:47:44] That's how carnal become. That's how far
[1:47:46] from God it become. I was thinking about
[1:47:48] how what I'm talking about. He give the
[1:47:50] new spirit to to work with the Holy
[1:47:52] Spirit. That mean our natural spirit is
[1:47:54] terrible. Yeah. That's why he give you a
[1:47:56] new heart. Our heart is too corrupt. So
[1:47:59] you take out your old heart. Stony
[1:48:01] heart. He call it stony heart. A heart
[1:48:03] against God. He give you a new heart. A
[1:48:05] heart towards God. Then he give you a
[1:48:07] clean up spirit that you could smile and
[1:48:09] laugh and enjoy the Lord and enjoy the
[1:48:11] BS and the blue and the flowers and
[1:48:12] everything else and shake your hand and
[1:48:14] feel nice and so on. And that new spirit
[1:48:17] is to work with the Holy Spirit. So how
[1:48:20] come you got jump from canal into
[1:48:21] charity?
[1:48:25] We have to have brotherly kindness on
[1:48:28] display
[1:48:29] so God will have issues around you to
[1:48:32] see what you will do if you will drop
[1:48:35] it. If you would forgive, if you would
[1:48:38] press past the past,
[1:48:40] [Applause]
[1:48:41] God testing the other person and God
[1:48:43] testing you.
[1:48:47] Could you be right and say you're sorry?
[1:48:50] Oh, that's a killer there. You know
[1:48:52] you're right. The person is wrong. And
[1:48:54] you say, "Sorry, forgive me,
[1:48:57] brother." That mash them up. They don't
[1:48:58] know how to handle that. not mashing you
[1:49:01] up because that's killing you and giving
[1:49:03] more room for the spirit to grow inside
[1:49:06] of you. You can't win every case. You
[1:49:08] can't fight every battle. Certain things
[1:49:10] you just have to let go and let God. Oh,
[1:49:13] give the Lord some praises.
[1:49:16] All
[1:49:18] right. Your mind accept it. It grasp it.
[1:49:21] What is your mind controlled by? Your
[1:49:23] spirit. Hallelujah. So your spirit
[1:49:26] catches the word of God. And that's the
[1:49:29] thing that got life in it. Not from Time
[1:49:32] magazine and Newsweek magazine. The word
[1:49:35] is what have life in it. God is who
[1:49:38] spoke this word. God is who wrote this
[1:49:40] word. And we come to preach the word.
[1:49:43] Which is the gospel and that word is
[1:49:45] what your spirit catch. That what raises
[1:49:48] you up. Look that centurion man. He
[1:49:50] stood there watching Jesus operate. And
[1:49:52] when it struck him he said don't even
[1:49:55] come and touch my servant. Just speak
[1:49:58] the word.
[1:49:59] Because I am a son, a servant under
[1:50:02] authority. And I say to one, go and he
[1:50:04] goeth. Hallelujah. Say to one come, he
[1:50:07] cometh. Speak the word. What is he
[1:50:09] saying? I understand by revelation the
[1:50:12] authority you have over sickness,
[1:50:14] disease, and devils. Hallelujah. Just as
[1:50:17] I have authority, you have authority.
[1:50:19] You don't need to come and lay hands.
[1:50:21] You just have to speak and it shall be
[1:50:24] so. Oh, give the Lord a shout. That's a
[1:50:27] gentile. That's not a baptized believer.
[1:50:30] That's a man watching the operation of
[1:50:33] the gift of God in Jesus and identify
[1:50:37] himself with it.
[1:50:40] To be in authority, we have to be under
[1:50:42] authority. We have to be authorized to
[1:50:45] do, to work, to administer. And once we
[1:50:49] under authority, then all heaven is
[1:50:51] behind us. Glory to God. The angels are
[1:50:54] behind us because we are under
[1:50:57] authority. Oh, give the Lord a shout.
[1:51:00] You can't give yourself authority. You
[1:51:02] have to be under authority. And the man
[1:51:05] recognize that Jesus was the under the
[1:51:07] authority of his father. Then he could
[1:51:09] do all things. Oh, give the Lord a
[1:51:11] shout. Wait till that bride recognizes
[1:51:14] the headship over the body which is
[1:51:16] charity, the voice of the archangel, the
[1:51:19] word hanging over that bride under
[1:51:21] authority. Woo! Anything can happen.
[1:51:26] Hallelujah.
[1:51:29] So watch your mind is controlled by the
[1:51:32] spirit. Your spirit catches the word.
[1:51:35] That's the thing that got life in it. It
[1:51:37] bring life into you. Watch what's the
[1:51:40] matter. You have to open the channel
[1:51:43] first. You got to get the soul of the
[1:51:45] Holy Spirit placed at the battlefront
[1:51:48] and take God's word. He is the word and
[1:51:50] he stands there and there's nothing
[1:51:52] going to stop it. Every one of the other
[1:51:55] channels is cleared out.
[1:51:58] That's what the matter with so much
[1:52:00] blowed up Christians is because they
[1:52:01] don't clean the channels out. What's he
[1:52:04] saying? They don't go down on the
[1:52:06] inside. So that's that's mean you're
[1:52:08] living a surface life. A surface life is
[1:52:12] a life that is not examined. Amen. You
[1:52:15] come to church, you go back home. But
[1:52:17] are you examining your walk, your talk,
[1:52:20] your desires, your attitude? Because
[1:52:22] when you want to be changed, you want to
[1:52:24] be changed from the core.
[1:52:28] Hallelujah.
[1:52:30] If you live a service life, you're not
[1:52:32] seeing you. So you're almost walking in
[1:52:34] denial.
[1:52:38] You're not recognizing what God called
[1:52:40] you onto. So today you're saved and
[1:52:42] tomorrow you feel so saved. You're not
[1:52:43] saved tomorrow. And today back and
[1:52:45] forth, back and forth. And God hates
[1:52:46] that. Amen. God want you to stand by
[1:52:49] your confession. What if God told
[1:52:51] Abraham, you know, I mean, 25 years for
[1:52:53] that baby, you know, and Abraham decided
[1:52:55] to drink until next 24 years, he come
[1:52:57] back
[1:52:58] out. A back Lord, hallelujah. Glory.
[1:53:00] This is the year. This is the year of
[1:53:03] Jubilee of faith. That's foolishness.
[1:53:06] Thanks, God didn't tell him how long it
[1:53:07] would take. He just dropped the promise
[1:53:09] on them and said, "Walk Abraham." Every
[1:53:11] year you walk in. 10 years pass and you
[1:53:14] don't even know how you make it. And
[1:53:15] many time you look back, we don't know
[1:53:16] how we come through all these things.
[1:53:17] You know, we pass through hell and all
[1:53:19] kind of stuff, man. And we still alive
[1:53:21] and kicking and the devil ain't get us.
[1:53:24] He's behind us, but he catch us. We are
[1:53:27] running this race. Oh, glory to God. And
[1:53:30] we're not running just to run. We
[1:53:31] running to win. Go hear a shout in the
[1:53:34] house. You're not running just to enter
[1:53:36] the race. You're running to win. And we
[1:53:39] will win. God ordain winners in this
[1:53:41] hour. He all ordain overcomers. This is
[1:53:44] our oh glory. We shall not all sleep.
[1:53:47] Hallelujah. Some will sleep but not all.
[1:53:50] Oh give the Lord some praises. So
[1:53:52] because they don't clean the channels
[1:53:54] out, they don't go down into the inside.
[1:53:56] You have got to clear it out.
[1:53:58] Conscience, memory, thoughts.
[1:54:00] Just just we talk about imagination. If
[1:54:02] you don't arrest your imagination and
[1:54:04] arrest and lock it up and chain it up,
[1:54:06] you're going floating in the air.
[1:54:10] Yes. True people fear truth. But it's
[1:54:11] true for everybody. Me too. Yes. If I
[1:54:14] tell you my imagine take me, I wouldn't
[1:54:16] tell you.
[1:54:21] I would tell you cuz sometime want to
[1:54:23] stay there and say you that not
[1:54:26] real come
[1:54:29] from helping this one doing this for
[1:54:31] this one doing for everybody. But
[1:54:34] they're not real.
[1:54:36] All right. Listen to this one. No matter
[1:54:39] if 10,000 died on this side today, trust
[1:54:42] him. 10,000 died on that side tomorrow,
[1:54:44] trust him. That has nothing to do with
[1:54:46] me. Could you say that?
[1:54:49] [Applause]
[1:54:55] I remember by Andrew telling me about
[1:54:56] how they used to do sales a long time.
[1:54:58] How they used to wonder how much nos
[1:54:59] you're going to get. You go and sell by
[1:55:00] yourself. No. No. And they are trained
[1:55:03] in a way where they counting how much
[1:55:05] nos because every no that they get
[1:55:07] coming to a
[1:55:09] yes what different mindset
[1:55:12] somebody who don't have that mindset
[1:55:13] whether he had two three
[1:55:15] nos this not for me you know but you
[1:55:18] can't tell that to a man train like
[1:55:21] Andrew because he know he get six nos
[1:55:23] nine nos and he know yes coming after 10
[1:55:26] year nos he get a yes that's what you're
[1:55:28] looking for you're not looking for the
[1:55:29] nose you're looking for the Yes. Because
[1:55:32] you out to sell. Oh, give the Lord a
[1:55:35] shout in the house. Could we be like
[1:55:37] that? Don't 10,000 fall on this side.
[1:55:39] Don't 10,000 fall on that side. That has
[1:55:42] nothing to do with me.
[1:55:44] This one fail. This one fall. This one
[1:55:46] backslide. What you telling me that for?
[1:55:48] That has nothing to do with me. That is
[1:55:51] their story. That's not my story. Give
[1:55:53] the Lord a shout in the house.
[1:56:01] When you could go through the nose like
[1:56:02] that, you're rock solid. In other words,
[1:56:06] negativity don't affect you. Period. So
[1:56:09] actually the negatives only bring you to
[1:56:11] a positive. So they're laughing at the
[1:56:13] nose because the nose making it a yes.
[1:56:16] That's faith. That's what faith does. We
[1:56:19] are not taking no. We going to have a
[1:56:21] breakthrough. We are not taking no.
[1:56:23] We're going to have people inspired by
[1:56:24] the spirit. We are not taking no. We are
[1:56:27] going to have people that going to be
[1:56:28] delivered. Hallelujah. Give the Lord
[1:56:30] some praises.
[1:56:34] I'm the one that believe it. If we want
[1:56:37] to open up a challenge, then we can. We
[1:56:39] find Oh, okay. Let's get this one. If
[1:56:40] you got your senses, see, taste, feel,
[1:56:42] smell, and hear. They're all right. But
[1:56:44] don't trust them unless they agree with
[1:56:47] the word. But watch. Imagination,
[1:56:49] conscience, memory, reasoning,
[1:56:51] affections, they're all right if they
[1:56:52] agree with the word. But if your
[1:56:54] affection doesn't agree with the word,
[1:56:55] get rid of it.
[1:56:58] If your conscience, anything disagrees
[1:57:00] with what on the inside, get rid of it.
[1:57:03] That is the battleground. The mind is
[1:57:05] the gate to the spirit. Your mind opens
[1:57:09] up and accept the spirit or reject the
[1:57:11] spirit. Some people attitude, they fold
[1:57:13] their hand. They want to worship God and
[1:57:15] what not. They're rejecting.
[1:57:17] They're rejecting the atmosphere. They
[1:57:18] don't like the scream and they shout.
[1:57:20] They want somebody that could just talk
[1:57:21] to them and explain and whatnot hours
[1:57:23] just killing time and so on. But you
[1:57:25] have to get in the spirit fighting for
[1:57:26] that. What for? That the Holy Ghost
[1:57:29] could reveal it to you because the Holy
[1:57:31] Ghost alone is the revealer of the
[1:57:33] revelation of Jesus Christ personally to
[1:57:35] you. You need your own revelation. You
[1:57:38] can't go by your father, your mother,
[1:57:39] your brother, sister. You cannot go by
[1:57:41] any family. You have got to get your own
[1:57:43] revelation. That's why David could
[1:57:45] testify. Oh, give the Lord a shout. When
[1:57:48] nobody want to face Goliath, David can
[1:57:50] give his testimony. I was out with my
[1:57:52] sheep and here come a bear and I God
[1:57:55] delivered that bear into my hands and
[1:57:57] out with my sheep and here come the lion
[1:57:59] and God delivered the lion into my
[1:58:01] hands. He has given a testimony. Faith
[1:58:03] is real to him. He exercised his faith.
[1:58:06] He prove his faith. Isn't that right?
[1:58:08] And he said, "The God that delivered the
[1:58:10] bear and the lamb into my hands shall
[1:58:12] show deliver unto me." Oh the Lord a
[1:58:15] shout. That's what David said. He had an
[1:58:18] experience. And usually you have to have
[1:58:20] experience to have faith and faith
[1:58:22] brings experience. Oh give the Lord a
[1:58:24] shout. Faith is a living thing. It's not
[1:58:27] a talking thing. Is a living thing.
[1:58:29] Glory of God. When David got his five
[1:58:32] smooth stones, he ran to meet Goliath.
[1:58:34] He was so convinced. If he was walking
[1:58:37] and look and examine his size closely,
[1:58:39] he said, "Nah, God too big. Guess I
[1:58:40] going back." But David wasn't watching
[1:58:42] Goliath's size. He was watching the God
[1:58:45] that was upon him. Are you going to
[1:58:47] sing? The spirit of the Lord is upon my
[1:58:49] heart. Oh, glory to God. I can sing like
[1:58:52] David's son. Hallelujah. And the spirit
[1:58:56] of the Lord comes upon my hand. Oh,
[1:58:59] glory to God. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:59:02] David ran to meet
[1:59:05] [Applause]
[1:59:06] [Music]
[1:59:07] Goliath.
[1:59:08] Golth fearless. He is big. He's bold.
[1:59:12] He's bad. He said, "I'll feed you to the
[1:59:14] beds."
[1:59:16] He's embarrassed. David said, "You come
[1:59:18] with me with spay unsured. I come to you
[1:59:20] in the name of the Lord. Today, not next
[1:59:23] week, not next service. Today, I cut
[1:59:26] your head off. Today, you are corner.
[1:59:29] Today, you are finished. Today, you
[1:59:31] exiting this life. Oh, the Lord, I shout
[1:59:33] in the house. Vector to
[1:59:36] Goliath. Oh, glory to God. protected
[1:59:38] that demon hanging over you, binding
[1:59:41] you, cramping you, holding you back.
[1:59:44] Hallelujah. Praise God. Glory to God.
[1:59:47] And David without a sword said, "I'll
[1:59:50] cut your head off." That is faith.
[1:59:55] Do you see it? David wasn't going by
[1:59:58] senses. He had no sword and he
[2:00:00] prophesied I,
[2:00:03] not I, my brother. Yeah, cuz your
[2:00:05] brothers only complain about David and G
[2:00:07] confusing the all kind of old stripper
[2:00:09] talk. Well, why why you doing out here?
[2:00:11] What to the father sheep and you coming
[2:00:13] here to see the battle like a battle
[2:00:14] going on? The only polishing shoes and
[2:00:16] polishing spear and reading spoke with
[2:00:18] books and listening to tapes. No
[2:00:20] exercise of faith whatsoever.
[2:00:21] Hallelujah. When David take out Golad
[2:00:24] here, they both we win.
[2:00:26] Everybody win. Yeah, that's right.
[2:00:28] Because one man had the courage not to
[2:00:31] talk about Goliath or shining sword or
[2:00:33] or sharpen sword what not looking at
[2:00:35] Goliath. One man had the courage to take
[2:00:36] him out.
[2:00:40] And you know at first they didn't move
[2:00:41] right until they saw the head rolling
[2:00:43] down. You know all them fell so much in
[2:00:46] the senses so much in the flesh they had
[2:00:47] to make sure that man really did. You
[2:00:48] know when they see the head rolling down
[2:00:50] they start to shout. He really did. But
[2:00:52] he really did. He really did. He really
[2:00:53] did. God may we see that head rolling
[2:00:56] down tonight. Oh, give the Lord a shout.
[2:00:58] Let us see the head of them five senses
[2:01:00] rolling off the praise
[2:01:03] God. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. That you
[2:01:05] could rejoice in spirit. That you could
[2:01:07] rejoice in faith. That rejoice that God
[2:01:10] elected you to be in such a time as
[2:01:12] this. Amen. Amen.
[2:01:15] Amen. My God, we going
[2:01:19] good. Your mind opens up and accept the
[2:01:21] spirit or reject the spirit. He says you
[2:01:24] can have little consciousness, little
[2:01:25] feelings, little sensations that has
[2:01:28] nothing to do with it. That's just
[2:01:29] sensation and things. When it comes to
[2:01:31] reality, your mind opens it up. Your
[2:01:35] mind either accepts it or rejects it.
[2:01:38] It's your mind that open up the door or
[2:01:40] closes the door. Faith come by hearing
[2:01:43] and hearing the word. So the word comes
[2:01:45] bring it intellectual faith. Then when
[2:01:47] the Holy Spirit operate in it and drop
[2:01:48] it on your heart, it become a spiritual
[2:01:50] revelation. Anchor in your soul. That's
[2:01:52] the faith that the devil cannot take
[2:01:54] out. It's anchored in your soul. You
[2:01:57] have all what you have possessed yet,
[2:01:59] but there's something God put in you
[2:02:00] that the devil can't take it. And you
[2:02:02] know it. It's an anchor point. That's an
[2:02:06] anchor point. That's where you can go
[2:02:07] back in your Christian walk and put a
[2:02:09] stake and anchor it right there. That's
[2:02:11] where God dealt with me. That's where
[2:02:13] God kept me. That's where God held me.
[2:02:15] Devil, you can't move from that. It's an
[2:02:17] anchor point. Oh, give the Lord some
[2:02:20] praises.
[2:02:22] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Glory. So your
[2:02:25] mind open up the door or closes the
[2:02:26] door. Listens to your conscience.
[2:02:29] Listens to your memory. Listen to your
[2:02:31] affection.
[2:02:35] If I was listening to people, I go on a
[2:02:37] long time. You know, it's just that I
[2:02:40] You ever hear about the the frog that
[2:02:43] was deaf
[2:02:46] and they telling me can't make it? Yeah.
[2:02:48] And he was bunking me with milk and keep
[2:02:49] jumping, jumping, jumping. And the milk
[2:02:51] is get hard and hard and he jump out. I
[2:02:54] said I was telling you couldn't make it.
[2:02:55] You couldn't make it. But the was
[2:02:56] deaf. So he wasn't hearing they couldn't
[2:02:58] make it. And I get deaf to every other
[2:03:00] voice outside telling me we can't make
[2:03:03] it. Everybody say can't make it. You
[2:03:05] can't make it. But here we are. We are
[2:03:07] going to make it because we climbing
[2:03:09] that
[2:03:10] pyramid. That's what we doing. You know,
[2:03:12] we climbing that pyramid, you know. And
[2:03:14] I'm preaching faith. Faith to climb
[2:03:16] higher. Oh, give the Lord some
[2:03:18] praises. All of you who are stuck on
[2:03:21] that pyramid, you're going higher
[2:03:23] tonight.
[2:03:24] This is the day for you to go up. Come
[2:03:27] on, give the Lord a shout in the house.
[2:03:29] This is the day for you to go beyond
[2:03:31] where you
[2:03:31] [Applause]
[2:03:35] are. So, your mind open, that door,
[2:03:37] closes the door. Listens to your
[2:03:39] conscience, listens to your memory,
[2:03:42] listens to your affections. And when
[2:03:44] your mind closes under these things and
[2:03:46] let God's spirit of his word come in and
[2:03:48] blow the rest of the stuff out, every
[2:03:50] doubt is gone. Here we go. Quote me.
[2:03:51] Every fear is gone. Every sensation is
[2:03:54] gone. Every feeling is gone. And there
[2:03:56] is nothing standing there but the word
[2:03:58] of God. And Satan cannot battle against
[2:04:01] that.
[2:04:04] So you find brother saying, I don't know
[2:04:05] if he'll come. I don't know, you know,
[2:04:07] I'm waiting on don't know if he'll come
[2:04:08] or what not. Then all of a sudden he
[2:04:10] said, he is here. Yes. Note what
[2:04:12] happened after that. Then he says, I
[2:04:14] take every spirit. And when he says that
[2:04:16] is every spirit. I take every spirit
[2:04:19] here under my control for the honor and
[2:04:23] glory of God. He knew every demon in
[2:04:26] that place is subject to him. At that
[2:04:29] point, brother Abbrand knew the whole
[2:04:31] heaven behind him because the angel is
[2:04:33] present
[2:04:37] under that anointing. He is fearless.
[2:04:39] under that anointing. He could call out
[2:04:41] diabetes, any kind of condition. One
[2:04:43] time he said all who have diabetes all
[2:04:44] stand up. He said to deal with them by
[2:04:47] groups. Yes. Hallelujah. Because demons
[2:04:50] have to ask other demons for help. You
[2:04:51] know, he said this one call for help
[2:04:52] across there. Say stand up there. Bow.
[2:04:55] Cast all them out one time. Group
[2:04:57] dismissal.
[2:05:00] Oh, glory to God. Hallelujah. We
[2:05:02] dismissing them by the groups. All of
[2:05:04] their sickness and bow all them. Get out
[2:05:08] of here. Get out of here.
[2:05:13] [Music]
[2:05:18] Hallelujah.
[2:05:20] Hallelujah.
[2:05:23] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:05:26] You said, "Let's get the atomic bomb."
[2:05:27] What is it? F AI T. Fate. That's called
[2:05:30] atomic bomb. You say, "Is that right,
[2:05:32] brother Brandham? Why then? Why does it
[2:05:34] on some and not on others?" It's because
[2:05:37] of the channel. You can look out and
[2:05:40] see. And you've got to have it here
[2:05:42] looking this way, not out here looking
[2:05:44] in. But you got to be in looking out.
[2:05:46] You can't come through reason. You can't
[2:05:49] come through these other things. You've
[2:05:51] got to come through the God's channel
[2:05:53] right down into your soul. He said, you
[2:05:55] say your senses, I can feel it. Yeah, I
[2:05:58] might smell it, but and all these things
[2:06:00] is reasoning. He said, but God's word
[2:06:02] above all things I would that you
[2:06:04] prosper in health. Look how God busting
[2:06:05] this thing about healing. I would that
[2:06:07] you prosper and be in health. Now, how
[2:06:09] can you be a real soldier out there? You
[2:06:11] say, "I want to prosper in health."
[2:06:16] Amen. We can't help you if you claim
[2:06:18] that's how your father was and your
[2:06:19] grandfather was and your
[2:06:20] great-grandfather and your great great
[2:06:21] grandfather had it and you have it too.
[2:06:23] That doesn't help your situation.
[2:06:26] You have to believe that God wants you
[2:06:29] to be in good health. Because good
[2:06:31] health is serving better.
[2:06:35] Hallelujah.
[2:06:37] Hallelujah.
[2:06:39] You have to let him in. Okay. I might
[2:06:41] read this here. All right. Am I tireing
[2:06:43] you? All right. If Satan get through
[2:06:46] here by these conscience and all these
[2:06:48] things then he gets down here to the end
[2:06:50] of the soul in the mind. Now you will
[2:06:53] never look at one of them thing until
[2:06:55] first you have to let him in there. You
[2:06:57] have to let him in. And when he gets in
[2:06:59] he's got control. Then what does he do?
[2:07:02] He begins to use the conscience.
[2:07:06] So somebody did you something and you
[2:07:09] forget about it and
[2:07:11] whatnot and somehow you bounce them up
[2:07:14] again. And when you bounce them up, your
[2:07:16] eyes see them, you remember what they
[2:07:18] do. That's when they come back in. All
[2:07:20] the time you ain't seen them, it gone.
[2:07:22] When you see them and afterwards it
[2:07:24] raise back up.
[2:07:26] Right there. You have a choice. Let it
[2:07:29] go or renew it. I call renew your
[2:07:32] passport or driver's permit. And some
[2:07:35] people just renew this. You say,
[2:07:37] "Renew."
[2:07:39] And then you have a ought now when you
[2:07:41] come into it. Hallelujah. Ding the
[2:07:43] glory. Singing sweet, sweet, sweet,
[2:07:46] sweet. Hallelujah. Amen. And you have a
[2:07:49] inside of there.
[2:07:51] Revive us again. God say what? Revive
[2:07:53] what? That inside you. How you expect a
[2:07:55] revival inside? when you have a inside
[2:07:57] of that. Now listen friends, I am
[2:08:00] encountering it so often. This oath and
[2:08:03] bly forgiven is a serious issue.
[2:08:08] It's a issue since in Jesus time that
[2:08:11] Peter come say Lord if a brother offend
[2:08:13] me shall I survive for forgive him seven
[2:08:14] times a day.
[2:08:16] Peter run with the number. He thought it
[2:08:18] was a big number. You know, it's a big
[2:08:20] number. But seven times a day, you
[2:08:22] expect your brother to offend you seven
[2:08:24] times, boy. I have the brother around so
[2:08:26] long times.
[2:08:30] Jesus is 70* 7. So it was an issue that
[2:08:33] was there as humans. We are here in the
[2:08:36] flesh. There are things we may not
[2:08:38] directly do. We may not want to offend.
[2:08:40] But sometime you do things that offend.
[2:08:42] Yes. And and and and is unintentional.
[2:08:46] and somebody take it in an offensive
[2:08:48] manner and react. How do you do that as
[2:08:50] brothers and sisters and and so on like
[2:08:52] that? You have to be able to let things
[2:08:53] go, forgiving one another, loving one
[2:08:55] another, encourage one another instead
[2:08:57] of going and talk and talk and talk and
[2:08:58] talk and find it and find out. You don't
[2:08:59] know what the person have been through.
[2:09:03] So use your conscious, he used this
[2:09:05] outlet, taste, smell, hear, imagination,
[2:09:08] conscious, memory, reason, affection. He
[2:09:10] begin to use all these different title
[2:09:11] type of channels, right? He's got to
[2:09:13] come into your mind first. You got to
[2:09:15] accept it. He said come out from amongst
[2:09:17] the people Abraham they are the thing
[2:09:19] they are doubters unbelievers leave all
[2:09:22] your conscience and senses behind you
[2:09:24] like that
[2:09:26] tonight church why don't you come out
[2:09:29] from your senses and your feelings and
[2:09:31] emotion start to believe what God said
[2:09:33] not just from a general perspective but
[2:09:35] from what God said about you
[2:09:39] when you hear he said you have not
[2:09:41] chosen me but I have chosen you and you
[2:09:44] accept you as God's choice voice. So you
[2:09:46] stop talking this thing. I am worthy and
[2:09:48] I worthy. When you cut out that
[2:09:50] foolishness, take your unworthiness and
[2:09:52] go with it. God said you have not chosen
[2:09:55] me. I have chosen you. He chose you as
[2:09:58] you are. Not to remain as you are, but
[2:10:00] to change your life, to change your
[2:10:02] walk, to change your attitude. And we
[2:10:04] are trying to encourage you to be
[2:10:06] renewed in the spirit of your mind by
[2:10:08] having a new perspective, a fresh
[2:10:10] perspective of life that you could
[2:10:12] breathe, that you could live. He said,
[2:10:14] "I come that my life have it more
[2:10:15] abundantly." All right, we almost
[2:10:17] finished here.
[2:10:21] Musicians begin to come
[2:10:26] out. He said, "Come out from among the
[2:10:28] people." Abraham,
[2:10:30] separate yourself and lift for me. What
[2:10:32] is it? So, he's detailing this here.
[2:10:36] Leave all your conscience and senses
[2:10:37] behind you like that. Open up your mind
[2:10:40] and remember it is me. Come live with
[2:10:43] me. And hear the bomb here. Now God is
[2:10:46] calling every seed of Abraham this
[2:10:48] morning to that same kind of a life. God
[2:10:51] wants his children separating themselves
[2:10:54] from see, taste, smell, hear,
[2:10:57] imagination, conscience, memories,
[2:11:00] reason, affection, everything. Open up
[2:11:03] their mind and let the word come in and
[2:11:07] march with the word. Oh, glory to God.
[2:11:11] So when Isaiah said, "Wo is me. I'm
[2:11:12] undone." God sent fire from off the
[2:11:15] altar. He said God was showing the
[2:11:17] prophet that his cleansing power was
[2:11:19] fire off the altar. God cleansing power
[2:11:21] today is not by receiving a creed or a
[2:11:24] message quote or being in a message
[2:11:27] group. God cleansing power today is not
[2:11:29] reciting a creed to join a church. It's
[2:11:31] the power of the Holy Ghost and fire
[2:11:33] that comes down and cleanses a man from
[2:11:36] all his unbelief. God's way of cleansing
[2:11:39] a prophet is by fire, not by creed. What
[2:11:42] would a prophet know about a creed? He's
[2:11:43] going to be used by God. The word was
[2:11:45] going to make manifest through him.
[2:11:47] Confession first and cleansed by fire.
[2:11:51] Confession first, cleansing second,
[2:11:54] commission was third. A man can repent
[2:11:57] of his sins and be still be thinking,
[2:11:58] well, he's an immoral man. Every immoral
[2:12:00] looking woman he finds, it's still
[2:12:02] there. Maybe he's a drunkard. Every time
[2:12:03] he smells the drink, it is still there.
[2:12:05] But when he gets sanctified, that
[2:12:07] cleanses the desire out of him. It takes
[2:12:09] the want of it away. He can still be
[2:12:12] tempted, but it takes the want of it
[2:12:13] away. God cleansed that man. Oh, glory
[2:12:16] to God. And sanctification. He said he
[2:12:18] calls the church through justification,
[2:12:19] through sanctification, then fill it
[2:12:21] with the Holy Ghost and fire. He took it
[2:12:22] through a process. Are you with me? All
[2:12:26] them want to be the bride instant bride.
[2:12:27] I give it instant coffee and Kentucky
[2:12:29] fried chicken. Here it is. He take the
[2:12:31] church through a process that he
[2:12:33] himself, the Holy Spirit himself, the
[2:12:35] son of God could dwell in the human
[2:12:37] heart. It has to go through that before
[2:12:40] he can come into it.
[2:12:43] So hear me message world, you have to go
[2:12:45] through the process.
[2:12:49] It's not I believe message I may bride.
[2:12:51] It does happen. So our process it has to
[2:12:54] go through baptism of fire, holy fire
[2:12:56] from God which cleanses the earth. The
[2:12:58] earth cleanses then it is purchased so
[2:13:00] that the redeemed can live on it. Notice
[2:13:02] the baptism of fire is to cleanse it
[2:13:04] from sin. Talking about the earth, from
[2:13:05] sickness, from disease, from sinners,
[2:13:07] from the devil, all his group, he's to
[2:13:09] be cast out in the lake of fire. Holy
[2:13:11] fire from God come down from God out of
[2:13:13] heaven and builds it up. Notice to make
[2:13:15] it ready for God to dwell in. For God in
[2:13:18] the new world is to come to dwell on the
[2:13:20] earth. Now watch. And the same plan of
[2:13:23] redemption is used to redeem both the
[2:13:26] world and the persons that live in it.
[2:13:28] So we have to get that baptism of fire.
[2:13:31] So he said this year, now here's the
[2:13:32] problem. The heart has to be cleansed
[2:13:35] like that. You see like that before God
[2:13:38] can come down in the person of the Holy
[2:13:41] Ghost, which is Christ coming down and
[2:13:43] dwell in the human heart. He said after
[2:13:45] add all all them virtues then the love
[2:13:47] of God Christ himself comes down and
[2:13:49] then you become a living moving monument
[2:13:51] with charity the abundant perfectness
[2:13:53] covering you amen holy fire from god
[2:13:57] comes down burn all desire from himself
[2:13:58] you become a new person not a old
[2:14:00] patched up one by joining church not
[2:14:02] turning a new page you're a complete
[2:14:04] brand new unit God takes the old man
[2:14:06] burns him out completely with the Holy
[2:14:08] Ghost and fire comes himself
[2:14:11] all right
[2:14:12] when the Holy Ghost comes into the heart
[2:14:14] quickly. He becomes a twofold being. One
[2:14:16] on earth to die and one of heaven to
[2:14:19] live. In his body, he's still subject to
[2:14:21] death. But in his soul, he's passed from
[2:14:24] death unto life. In his body, he has his
[2:14:26] earthly contact with five senses. In his
[2:14:28] spirit, he has contact with God through
[2:14:30] the Holy Ghost. And the angels of God
[2:14:33] visits them, speaks with them, and they
[2:14:36] are messengers sent from God to reveal
[2:14:39] and to bring messages from God. Amen.
[2:14:42] I'm going closing with this here. I want
[2:14:44] to pray something softly. Galatians 2:20
[2:14:46] says, "I am crucified with Christ." Paul
[2:14:48] the apostle, Paul the prophet said, "I
[2:14:50] am crucified with Christ. Nevertheless,
[2:14:52] I live yet not I, but Christ liveth in
[2:14:56] me. And the life which I now live in the
[2:14:59] flesh, I live by the faith of the son of
[2:15:02] God who love me and give himself for
[2:15:05] me." Romans 12, we almost almost read
[2:15:08] it. present your bodies. But I want to
[2:15:10] read it in the amplified and we close.
[2:15:11] That's all I have. That's it. I appeal
[2:15:14] to you, brethren, and beg of you in view
[2:15:16] of all the mercies of God to make a
[2:15:19] decisive decision, decisive dedication
[2:15:22] of your bodies, presenting all your
[2:15:24] members and faculties as a living
[2:15:26] sacrifice, holy, devoted, consecrated,
[2:15:29] and well pleasing to God, which is a
[2:15:31] reasonable, rational, intelligent
[2:15:33] service, spiritual worship. Do not be
[2:15:35] conformed to this world, fashion after,
[2:15:38] adapted to it external superficial
[2:15:40] customs, but be transformed, changed by
[2:15:44] the entire renewal of your mind, by its
[2:15:47] new ideals and its new attitude, so that
[2:15:49] you may prove for yourselves what is
[2:15:51] that good and acceptable and perfect
[2:15:53] will of God, even the thing that is good
[2:15:55] and acceptable and perfect in his sight
[2:15:56] for you. Let's all stand and give God
[2:15:58] some praises. Father God, we thank you
[2:15:59] for your presence. We thank you for your
[2:16:01] word, Lord. Lord and I pray you have the
[2:16:03] prayer ministers even right now in the
[2:16:05] hearts of and lives of your believing

[2:25:12] blessings upon them also, Father. May

[2:25:20] And amen. Give me a key for that song.

[2:26:42] I don't do it again. I can't do it
[2:26:47] again.
[2:26:50] Oh, I have
[2:26:53] no faith in his word. God can do it.
[2:26:57] Well, now yesterday and the day before

[2:28:12] him he's real today. Hallelujah. My
[2:28:15] declaration
[2:28:45] I can't live without
[2:28:47] him. That is why I love you
[2:28:53] so. Amen. You appreciate the Lord this
[2:28:57] morning. Come to give the Lord a hand of
[2:28:59] praise. Are you happy to be in the house
[2:29:02] of the
[2:29:03] Lord? What a time in the presence.
[2:29:07] And what a
[2:29:09] blessing to brave the weather, to brave
[2:29:11] how you feel, to brave the circumstances
[2:29:14] of life, and to make a choice to be here
[2:29:17] in the house of the Lord for God to
[2:29:19] speak to us in the only the way that he
[2:29:21] can. Amen. You could play something
[2:29:23] softly. We have some prayer
[2:29:27] requests uh from brother Andy Henry
[2:29:30] requesting prayer for my wife Victoria
[2:29:32] who is down with the flu and body pains.
[2:29:35] also Andrew and Alexander who is coming
[2:29:38] down with it that God will bring total
[2:29:40] healing and deliverance and I know there
[2:29:42] are a number of people who are
[2:29:44] struggling with different types of
[2:29:46] viruses and these things. We want to
[2:29:48] also remember them in
[2:29:50] prayer. Also
[2:29:52] uh from brother Hugh Williams I had a CT
[2:29:55] scan on my head and the doctor said the
[2:29:58] swelling could be a tumor. However, he
[2:29:59] requested a body scan to see if there's
[2:30:03] any more or other swellings. I'm
[2:30:05] scheduled to do that body scan in June.
[2:30:07] Please pray that all will be well and
[2:30:10] results will be favorable. So, we want
[2:30:11] to remember God's servant brother Hugh
[2:30:13] in prayer. And if there's any other
[2:30:15] requests this morning that you want to
[2:30:16] show by raise of hands as we approach
[2:30:18] the throne of grace, the throne of
[2:30:21] mercy, knowing that God is a healer,
[2:30:23] he's a way maker. He's a bomb in Gilead.
[2:30:27] The enemy has a job to do. But more
[2:30:29] importantly, we have a job to do. We are
[2:30:32] commanded to push back sickness. We are
[2:30:34] commanded to cast out diseases. We are
[2:30:37] commanded to lay hands on the sick and
[2:30:39] see them recover. We are commanded to
[2:30:41] pray. And knowing that God, he is a
[2:30:44] healer. He's a way maker. He is a
[2:30:46] deliverer. He's a restorer. And there's
[2:30:49] nothing that's too hard for him to
[2:30:50] address this morning. Can we approach
[2:30:52] the throne of grace? Heavenly Father, we
[2:30:55] stand, Lord, at your feet, Lord, looking
[2:30:58] for more from you. We thank you for the
[2:31:00] word that was spoken to us today through
[2:31:02] your son, your servant, and our pastor,
[2:31:04] Brother Theo, Lord, that he would stand
[2:31:06] behind the sacred desk and minister the
[2:31:08] words of eternal life. Lord, to
[2:31:11] continually point us to the promises, to
[2:31:13] the word, to the expectations of the
[2:31:16] word, for the standard of the word
[2:31:18] that's required for us to contend for
[2:31:20] the faith in such a time as this, Lord.
[2:31:23] We also understand that this message
[2:31:25] Lord is Lord. Yes, it has rapturing
[2:31:28] faith in it. Yes, it has Lord adoption
[2:31:30] in it, but it also has healing in it
[2:31:32] also. Father, Lord, you are our healer.
[2:31:35] You said healing is a children's bread.
[2:31:37] And we come this morning to eat of that
[2:31:39] bread this morning, Lord, knowing, Lord,
[2:31:42] that you want the best for us, Lord. So
[2:31:44] we pray this morning for Lord Sister
[2:31:47] Victoria in a special way, Father. Lord,
[2:31:50] how the enemy has attacked with the flu
[2:31:52] and the body pains, Father, that even
[2:31:53] now as the prayer goes forth, she'll get
[2:31:56] immediate relief in the mighty name of
[2:31:58] Jesus Christ. Lord, may you touch her
[2:32:00] completely from the crown of her head to
[2:32:02] the soles of her feet. Lord, may all be
[2:32:04] well. May that virus leave her body
[2:32:07] completely. Lord, we claim it. We speak
[2:32:09] it. We rejoice in it. We thank you in
[2:32:12] advance for a finished work this
[2:32:13] morning. And Lord, may you cover Andrew
[2:32:16] and Alexander even now how the enemy is
[2:32:19] trying to attack them also, Lord. May
[2:32:21] all be well in the mighty name of Jesus
[2:32:23] Christ. And may this request come back
[2:32:25] to us as a note of praise, Father. Lord,
[2:32:28] for your son and your servant, Brother
[2:32:30] Hugh Williams, Lord, he has stood
[2:32:32] faithful for all these years. Lord, this
[2:32:35] has been recorded, Father. Lord, he has
[2:32:37] stood for the truth for all these years.
[2:32:39] This has been recorded, Lord. And Satan
[2:32:41] is upset about it. Satan is mad about
[2:32:44] it, Father. Lord, and at this point in
[2:32:46] his journey, Lord, he has to deal with
[2:32:48] this swelling. We say, Satan, take your
[2:32:50] hand off of God's son now, in the mighty
[2:32:53] name of Jesus Christ, there's power in
[2:32:55] the church of the living God over every
[2:32:58] sickness, over every disease. We choose
[2:33:01] to relieve the report of the Lord. Whose
[2:33:03] report will we believe? We come against
[2:33:06] that negative report. We come against
[2:33:08] that swelling. We come against if it's
[2:33:10] we don't know what it is but we are
[2:33:11] whatever it is. House of hell give way
[2:33:14] to the name of Jesus Christ this
[2:33:16] morning. We pray dear God that that
[2:33:18] report will come back saying we can't
[2:33:21] find anything. There's nothing there
[2:33:23] because the great physician has already
[2:33:25] intervened. The great physician has made
[2:33:27] himself known. a great physician has
[2:33:30] showed up to make himself alive here
[2:33:33] among us in 2025. So, Father, whatever
[2:33:36] it is, we come against it in the name of
[2:33:38] Jesus. You promise to heal, you promise
[2:33:40] to deliver, you promise to raise up.
[2:33:42] Lord, may this be a time of his reward
[2:33:44] in the mighty name of Jesus Christ,
[2:33:46] Father. And Lord, for every hand that
[2:33:48] was raised, every knee that was
[2:33:50] expressed, every plea that was in the
[2:33:52] hearts of your people, every burden Lord
[2:33:55] that has taken a hold of your people, we
[2:33:58] unite as a church today. He said that if
[2:34:00] there are two touching anything in
[2:34:03] agreement, they could have whatever they
[2:34:04] ask for. We stand in agreement this
[2:34:07] morning for every sick in our midst. Uh
[2:34:09] for every downtrodden in our midst, uh
[2:34:12] for everyone that's struggling in our
[2:34:13] midst, uh for those that are connected
[2:34:15] online, uh for those that couldn't make
[2:34:17] it here today, we stand in the gap for
[2:34:20] everyone. Father, oh God, may you move
[2:34:22] through the camp. May you touch your
[2:34:24] sons and daughters. Lord, may healing
[2:34:27] rain pour down upon your people, Lord.
[2:34:30] Not just physical but mind, body, soul,
[2:34:33] spirit, psychologically, emotionally,
[2:34:36] financial healing, marital healing,
[2:34:39] family healing. Whatever the strain
[2:34:41] might be, whatever the stress might be,
[2:34:44] we cover with blood. Today, we plead the
[2:34:47] blood today. We apply the blood today.
[2:34:50] We apply the token on this church in the
[2:34:53] mighty name of Jesus Christ. May you
[2:34:56] bless our pastor. May you bless the
[2:34:58] leadership of the church. May you bless
[2:35:00] every brother, every sister that's a
[2:35:01] member of this church, Lord. May you
[2:35:03] bless every fellowship around the world,
[2:35:05] Lord, locally, regionally,
[2:35:07] internationally. Lord, we are one body
[2:35:09] and by one spirit. We are baptized into
[2:35:12] this one mystical body. May you
[2:35:14] strengthen your bride body. Father, we
[2:35:16] know the times are changing. We see the
[2:35:18] political moves. We see the economic
[2:35:20] moves. We see the religious moves.
[2:35:23] Father, even so, come quickly, Father.
[2:35:25] Lord, help us to be ready. You said the
[2:35:27] bride had made herself ready. Oh God,
[2:35:29] help us to be ready. May you bless the
[2:35:32] preparations for the upcoming
[2:35:33] convention. May you bless the meetings
[2:35:35] all over the world where the spirit of
[2:35:37] God is moving. Lord, may we be ready to
[2:35:40] receive the Holy Ghost to be revealed uh
[2:35:43] to be adopted, to be changed, to be
[2:35:45] transformed, for these 16 elements to go
[2:35:48] through a body change. Father, we commit
[2:35:50] your people into your hands. We commit
[2:35:52] the church into your hands in the mighty
[2:35:54] precious name of Jesus Christ. And the
[2:35:56] church says, And the church says,
[2:35:59] "Amen." You may be seated
[2:36:01] for a few
[2:36:04] minutes. May God bless you
[2:36:06] [Music]
[2:36:08] richly for
[2:36:10] our
[2:36:12] announcements. Service continues this
[2:36:14] coming Wednesday here at the tabernacle.
[2:36:18] looking forward for God to to do
[2:36:20] something tremendous for us. If you
[2:36:22] could be here, we encourage you to do
[2:36:24] so. Uh this coming Friday, we will have
[2:36:27] our Zoom prayer meeting online 8:00 p.m.
[2:36:31] Uh make it your business to be there.
[2:36:34] It's a serious hour that we're in and we
[2:36:37] are counting down and I believe that God
[2:36:39] has something special in store for us.
[2:36:42] This coming Sunday uh is the last Sunday
[2:36:45] of this month and we have a special
[2:36:48] service. Um although it's a Sunday
[2:36:51] service, we want to also dedicate this
[2:36:54] coming Sunday uh especially to the young
[2:36:57] people. And we want to also dedicate the
[2:37:00] service this Sunday for those that have
[2:37:02] been struggling. So we want to call it a
[2:37:04] bit of a youth focus service as well as
[2:37:07] a breakthrough service. So we are
[2:37:09] charging you and giving you a mandate to
[2:37:12] reach out to the young people, reach out
[2:37:15] to those that have been struggling,
[2:37:17] reach out to the backsliders, encourage
[2:37:19] one another, looking for God to do
[2:37:21] something for in a special way as we're
[2:37:24] just over a month away from the
[2:37:25] convention. And I believe that one of
[2:37:28] these days, as we often say, the last
[2:37:30] song will be sung, the last service will
[2:37:32] be had. And with all that's happening
[2:37:35] around, we don't know if this will be
[2:37:36] the last convention. We don't know if
[2:37:38] this will be our last year on the earth.
[2:37:39] We don't know because everything is just
[2:37:42] so volatile right now. And the Bible
[2:37:44] says that Satan knows that time is
[2:37:47] short. So if he knows that time is short
[2:37:49] and and he has a limited window of
[2:37:51] opportunity to do what he is supposed to
[2:37:53] do, then we have a limited time to do
[2:37:55] what we are supposed to do. And there's
[2:37:57] a promise and a prophecy over all of us
[2:38:00] that our family will be there. You know,
[2:38:02] God through the prophet said all that
[2:38:03] you love will be over there. So we want
[2:38:05] to have a special burden for our young
[2:38:07] people, for our families, for the
[2:38:09] backsliders, for those that are
[2:38:10] struggling to have a special service
[2:38:12] this coming Sunday. And we want to
[2:38:13] encourage you to be prayed up, come
[2:38:15] under expectation. Bring your fire, come
[2:38:17] with a burden. And we're doing this out
[2:38:19] of love. This is not to scare anybody,
[2:38:21] but it's to encourage one another that
[2:38:23] we got to be ready to leave here. So
[2:38:25] it's a very important time for us. So we
[2:38:27] want to encourage you, make every effort
[2:38:29] to not only be here, but encourage
[2:38:31] someone to be here also. maintenance
[2:38:34] team group five please meet with brother
[2:38:36] Blackman after the service and next week
[2:38:39] Lord willing uh it'll be group four
[2:38:42] which is brother Maron's group is carded
[2:38:44] to serve and also reminder the countdown
[2:38:48] is on to the upcoming convention July
[2:38:51] 18th 19th and 20th we're looking for a
[2:38:54] tremendous time in the Lord please
[2:38:56] continue to give your support in prayer
[2:39:00] your financial support your support in
[2:39:02] time and effort in contribution, making
[2:39:05] yourself available, and we're looking
[2:39:06] for God to do something special in our
[2:39:10] midst. And uh last and certainly not
[2:39:13] least,
[2:39:14] uh Sister Nicholas has a note of praise
[2:39:17] here. I'm seeing thanking God for
[2:39:20] allowing me to see another year for
[2:39:23] health and strength throughout my
[2:39:24] journey this year. And I believe today
[2:39:26] is sister Niko is today. My my my my
[2:39:29] happy birthday, Sister
[2:39:31] Nicholas. We love you. We appreciate
[2:39:33] you. And I am told that there's ice
[2:39:37] cream and cake for the entire church
[2:39:39] downstairs. So, Sister Nicholas clearly
[2:39:41] has a special impact that there's ice
[2:39:44] cream and cake for the entire church to
[2:39:45] celebrate your birthday. So, may God
[2:39:47] richly bless you and we invite the
[2:39:49] church to celebrate with her um
[2:39:51] downstairs. I know her family is excited
[2:39:54] to be here to do that for her as well.
[2:39:56] So, may the Lord Richie bless you,
[2:39:57] church. stay on the firing line. And uh
[2:40:01] no matter what you go through, I was
[2:40:03] sharing with someone recently, you know,
[2:40:06] the psalmist David said, "I've never
[2:40:08] seen the righteous forsaken
[2:40:11] or his seed beg bread." When you pause,
[2:40:14] because many times you look at the word,
[2:40:15] we we say these things, but we don't
[2:40:17] pause. It meant that David caught
[2:40:20] himself at a point in time, and when he
[2:40:23] reflected, he could make a I've never
[2:40:25] seen it. When I look back a year, 2
[2:40:28] years, 5 years, 10 years, I can't find
[2:40:31] one case study of the righteous
[2:40:34] forsaken. I can't find one piece of
[2:40:36] evidence of the righteous forsaken or
[2:40:39] ever seeing the seed beg bread. And I
[2:40:42] found myself sharing with someone else.
[2:40:43] I say listen, his strength is only made
[2:40:46] perfect in our weakness. So sometimes
[2:40:48] you come to a point where you feel low
[2:40:50] and you feel weak and you feel weary and
[2:40:53] you feel like things aren't working out.
[2:40:55] That is the only time when God's
[2:40:57] strength could be made perfect because
[2:40:59] the perfection of his strength could
[2:41:01] only be displayed when we are weak. Oh,
[2:41:04] come on now somebody. So, so sometimes
[2:41:06] we feel like we at the end of our road
[2:41:08] and how I end up here and God is saying
[2:41:10] I'm just waiting a little more to see
[2:41:11] you to that spot that my strength could
[2:41:13] step in in its perfection to carry you
[2:41:16] through. So, I want to encourage you
[2:41:18] church no matter how dark it gets, no
[2:41:20] matter how dismal it get. Brother
[2:41:22] preached. He said they could be coming
[2:41:23] to foreclose your house tomorrow. Faith
[2:41:25] has hair on its chest. Faith could step
[2:41:28] in the gap. Faith could say not this
[2:41:30] one. Mercy said no. So may the Lord
[2:41:33] richly bless you. God bless you. Thank
[2:41:39] you. Amen. You appreciate it today.
[2:41:42] Praise God. May God bless you as the
[2:41:44] ushers come. May you go out with a shout
[2:41:46] and faith in your heart. My friends
[2:41:49] don't like me because I am walking with
