i want to turn your bibles to one portion of scripture from john chapter 2. i want to read the scripture tonight jerald chapter 2 i want to read verse 1 to 15. next week wednesday night there'll be no night service we have a day of prayer and fast and in the morning to the evening and that will be there'll be no friday night service next week but we'll be seeking the lord amen so we're going to read joel chapter two reading from verse one blow ye the trumpet and zion sung an alarm in my holy mountain did all the inhabitants of the land tremble for the day of the lord cometh it is nigh at hand a day of darkness of gloominess a day of closure of thick darkness as the morning spread upon the mountains that great people and are strong yet not been ever the like neither shall it be anymore after it even to the years of many generations of fire devoured before them behind them a flame burn it the land is of the gardener even before them and behind them a desolate wilderness year nothing shall escape them the appearance of them is as the parents of horses and as horsemen so shall they run like the nose of charts on the tops of mountains shall they leap like the noise of flame of fire that devoured the stubble as a strong people set in battle array before their face the people shall be much pained all faces shall gather blackness they shall run like mighty men they shall climb the wall like men of war they shall march everyone on his ways and they shall not break their ranks neither shall one trust another they shall walk everyone in his path and when they fall upon the sword they shall not be wounded they shall run to and fro in the city they shall run upon the wall they shall climb up upon the houses they shall enter in at windows like a teeth the earth shall creep before them the heavens shall tremble the sun and the moon shall be dark the stars shall withdraw the shining and the lord shall utter his voice before his army for his camp is very great for he is strong that executed his word for the day of the lord is great and very terrible who can abide it therefore also now said the lord turning even to me with all your heart with fasting and with weeping and with mourning and ring your heart and not your garments and turn unto the lord your god for he is gracious and merciful slow to anger and of great kindness and repented him of the evil who knoweth if he will return and repent and leave a blessing behind him even a meat offering a drink offering unto the lord your god blow the trumpet in zion sanctify your fast call assembler call a solemn assembly may god bless his word you may be seated amen oh praise god could you say praise the lord tonight that's what we're here to do to praise him and to worship him oh praise god so tonight i will try to blow a trumpet song on a lamb that's the title tonight blow a trumpet song and the lamb and i believe this is a call to go out to call you out of samba out of liturgy out of being lukewarm and prayerless a call to repentance a call to confession a call to prayer now this trumpet was first announced in numbers 10 numbers 10 verse 1 to 10 and i'll read it and the lord's taken to moses saying make two the two trumpets of silver of whole peace shall now make them and don't misuse them he would have held purpose to them for the calling of the assembly for the journeyian of the camps when they shall blow with them all the assembly shall assemble themselves together to thee at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation if they blow but with one trumpet then the princes which are heads of thousands of israel shall guide themselves unto thee when you blow on a lamb then the camps that lie on the east parts shall go forward when you blow an alarm the second time then the camps that lie on the south side shall take their journey they shall blow alarm for their journeys but when the congregation is still gathered together you shall blow but you shall not sung an alam and the sons of aaron the priests shall blow the trumpets and they shall be to you for an ordinance forever throughout your generations and if you go to war in your land against the enemy that will present you then you shall blow an alarm with the trumpets and it shall be remembered before the lord your god you shall be saved from your enemy and on the day of your gladness and in your solemn days in the beginnings of your months you shall blow with the trumpets over your burnt offerings over the sacrifices of your peace offerings that they may be to you a memorial before your god i am the lord your god amen so that was where god introduced these trumpets and you notice that the trumpet gave a song to cause a certain action whether for war for gathering for announcement it had a purpose behind it it had instructions behind it it gives a distinct and a certain song for a certain purpose but tonight i am trusting that god so it to your heart then that you will arose you into action to shake you into action and not this intellectual sitting in church taken hearing word message thing not that but to spill you and to steal your interaction hallelujah do you believe that it was the duty of the priests to blow the trumpets for the assembling of the congregation to remove the camp to go out to war to announce danger it was the duty of the priests to blow that trumpet the church is in need of a weakness no wonder the prophet said the bride had no revival yet there will be no manifestation of god to stood up bride it will take them seven thunders the prophet knew that it would take something to wake up the people to wake up not the people i should say wake up the bride because she was sleeping but something going to wake her up oh do you believe that tonight so this trumpet was used a song and a lamb to give fear the danger is at hand a warning coming isn't that right to arose of impending danger arouse the people that they could be sensitive to the judgments that was at hand oh praise god hallelujah so we believe that there's a need for an awakening oh glory to god to get a fresh burden for your children and your family people take it for granted you know god is good what is good god is good you can save my children no burden no tears no travail no crying and sign parents and church children outside and there's no burden hallelujah or they're in a condition that you will get a burden oh to blow a trumpeting sign and sung an alarm to shake yourself to say this cannot continue something have to take place something of the breakfast oh glory to god when zion travels i am brought forth you can continue just like if normal normal normal a trumpet is a song that's saying something is about to happen judgment is about the strike it's the day of the lord i think of darkness and gloominess idea of judgment and earthquakes and all kind of disasters is coming nobody could stop it oh hallelujah praise the name of the lord hallelujah glory to god to shake the church from his dullness and from the lord oh glory to god whenever the trumpet song in it's given an an announcement that the judgment is certain hallelujah the judgment is near and the judgment is terrible all glory to god is not what people expect it is terrible and what the message i've not seen yet is the judgments of god oh glory to god the message never seen yet yet they come to church they believe a prophet and they come to church and they figure that there's certainly lord being in church that's not it you know god is the word hallelujah oh do you believe that what the scripture says let the inhabitants of the earth tremble who trembling now i have need of nothing now this year let the inhabitants of the earth tremble that's the scripture we read hallelujah praise god hallelujah praise be to jesus let's get it back here now oh glory to god hallelujah blow the trumpets in zion sunlight my holy mountain let all have tremble for the day of the lord cometh it is nigh at hand oh praise the name of the lord hallelujah let's continue praise god it was a call to an awakening of a deep repentance he said come deal with all your heart with fastings with reaping with travailing praise god and i hoping that god could give the out like like like truths to awaken you hallelujah people have so much information how they get settled with it they know everything you know more than looter you know more than than them messengers who was a mess early age they have more knowledge now than what they've been messing the age had and those old early like wesley and so forth people now know more than that because of what was revealed in the last day but what are they doing to what they know when jesus solomon faith in the earth whereas the works to express that faith when works is faith expressed faith is not a thought faith isn't writing something in our book faith is not reading scriptures faith is not reading preach any message that is not faith you know faith has to be expressed to be vindicated as fate and you can only do that by works oh glory to god harlow yuka had faith here tonight to come to church but don't miss the opportunity of what god wants to speak to you tonight don't think this is a light service you know don't think this is just a normal service you know this is a trumpet being blown oh glory to god a warning going out hallelujah praise the name of the lord hallelujah praise god hallelujah hallelujah trumpet songs and timer warning trumpet of the announced war all glory to god and a war against the family against your loved ones against your sons against your daughters against your husband against your wife spiritual wickedness in high places attacking from every corner oh glory to god you can't sit and do like it that's what's happening it is happening it's a war in the church it's a war again there's this church oh it's a war against your life it's a war against your soul you are fighting for your life tonight you are fighting to take your land tonight you are fighting to possess what you know is your own oh glory to god hallelujah warnings have always been given by god before judgment always he don't ever send judgment without warning he always send a warning for judgments people ignore the warning but the judgment is always coming but a warning give an opportunity to escape the judgment warning give an opportunity to make preparation for their judgments hallelujah glory to god people have conformed to the world so much like the world is nothing christian in the world you know it's nothing not like the old time days but we have to get back to spirit but i want to say the world is in their spirit they solomize in their spirit but the church is not in the spirit of the coming of the lord so there is a spirit of the coming of the lord that the church have to get into and the message was supposed to produce that the message is to produce that spirit of the coming of the lord under your heart turn back to the fate of the fathers oh glory to god amen hallelujah deadness and prayer prayerlessness no prayer life hallelujah to find back that channel where prayer becomes your breath prayer becomes the very life there becomes your energy prayer becomes where you went like all you have to go to the gas station to get gas to drive your car without prayer you have no gas prayer become your gas without the prayer you have no gasoline that mean you're running out hallelujah that means you ain't going nowhere you think you're going but you're not going anywhere because it's not your might it's not your power it's not your strength it's not your human energy and human spirit it has to be the spirit of god [Music] they're coming upon you oh glory to god amen the third pull is five things five things open up the word i've and you know i was thinking about it in my data on it and it comes like a sequence in an order he didn't say it in this order but i see it in his particular order open of the word tent vision spoken word king sword and preaching to eternal loss the eternal loss is the last one the opening word is the first one the tenth vision in the ten vision there was a little room that the fire the holy ghost the lord tell the the prophet the pillar fire went in there he said i'll meet you in there and when he asked about that little room god gave him a scripture when you pray pray to the father who seated you in secret and your father who sees you in secret shall reward you openly i don't have the time tonight but every one of the purple a scripture behind it king sword spoken word opening of the word every one of the scripture including preaching to eternal loss but they have to start by the opening of the word the word open to you hallelujah not the knowledge of the word the opening of the word where god reveal himself to you and have an effect upon your life like an open vision like what isaiah had that could drive him to the temple and say whoa with me i'm undone i'm a man of unclean lips a personalized vision of god that no family can shake it off your husband can shake you off your children can shake you off your body can shake you off nobody can shake you off because it's a vision from god hallelujah man i give you and manka take it away man i give it to you and mankind uninspired from you it's a vision that god give you it's in your heart hallelujah glory to god it can make you talk like caleb i brought word as it was in my heart oh glory to god we are well able to take this land because i'm bringing word as this was in my heart oh glory to god i've sat in this message for all these years and nobody ever affect me from going to possess this land the spirit land this mountain of god oh glory to god i will not back down from it all that was in god he poured into christ all that was in christ he pours into the church oh glory to god hallelujah lame wiki half their church god had promised to have that bride let me say it good jesus is going on marino have that bride oh glory to god some half dead woman what she has to do with that he can't walk through that he can't use that he can't anoint that it's very best may as well bury that no one is already hot or cold oh glory to god but if you're lukewarm or as your moat lukewarm you're looking like you're alive but you're dead he wants you on fire he wants your heart he wants your red heart he wants you under expectation for his coming he already redeemed you by his blood he already took the book oh glory to god not for himself but for you he took the book to bring you your redemptive rights oh give the lord i shout in the house oh hallelujah praise god amen that's why he took the book that you could get your redemptive rights hallelujah praise god hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah glory to god amen hallelujah praise god oh let me leave you with a scripture quickly hallelujah this revelation chapter 4 after this i looked and behold the door was open heaven and the first voice which i heard was that it was a trumpet talking with me saying come up hither i will show these things which must be thereafter oh glory to god that voice was like a trumpet tell him come up here trumpet voice said come up here don't stay in that earthly atmosphere don't stay in that natural country you have to come higher you have to come in the spirit to see further to see deeper to catch more or give the lord a shout you can stay in that fleshly kind of natural family selfish stuff and expect to see what you think you want to see christ what's the door christ is the door isn't that right and baron said before i set before you an open door and he's bringing a revelation inside of here he said this is from revelation chapter four justin ville he said you know i've said before the open door he said that to the methodist church they turn away from it i've set before an open door i put an open door which is the holy spirit amen hallelujah so when god put the open door here put no man with that door he put the holy spirit and set before their open door holy spirit and that age was an open door that anybody could that's why the pentecostal age had no man messenger it was open door still that's why the holy was poured upon them because open door isn't that right watch watch i'll put an open door which is the holy spirit and he said by one spirit we are all baptized into one body which is christ he set that message before the methodist church and they turn aside from it become the samification and refuse the holy ghost remember that's the open door how do we get into christ by one spirit holy spirit which is christ spirit we are enter in not by handshaking not by sprinkling but by one holy ghost baptism we are all baptized into one body and made particles of that one body one holy ghost baptism into that door oh hallelujah i saved again one holy ghost baptism into that door this door was set in heaven he looked up towards heaven and he seen an open door on the first voice song like a trumpet and all the scenes changed from patmos to heaven the voice here we go the voice that will walk with the seven golden candlesticks that same voice didn't change but the voice when it was heard in the first time how many remember that i was in the spirit of the lord's day in the spirit isn't that right i was in the spirit and lord's day and i heard behind me a voice of a trumpet that sounded like many waters and that many waters is the voice of the ministers the voice of the preachers the voice of many waters the voice of the people he explained what the voice of many waters is it's god's voice throughout the ages speaking the word to people and as they rejected the voice turned to judgment oh glory to god remember revelation is still a book of symbols a lot of things representing something else let's continue hallelujah and when i turned it look i saw one star in the midst of semicolon stands six and as he showed all the mystery of them seven golden candlesticks holding seven stars he looked and saw an open door an open door into heaven how do you get in by christ jesus one door one way any man can climb other way any other way same as a teeth and a rubber and in the parable there we go of the one who climbed up and was in the wedding supper without the garment on was found guilty was bound and cast into outer darkness only one way i believe i preached here not long ago whenever somebody gets married in the old country he gave out invitations himself he has to finish the robes and when he met this man sitting there how many remember the parable he found a man at the supper table without a wedding garment on what is it the bridegroom stands at the door and all who comes up with an invitation no man can come to the father except by me or when you come to the invitation so that everybody will look alike look alike not you better than who and i'm better than who look alike watch watch whether they're rich or poor bundle free black or white male or female they are all one in christ jesus and the bridegroom stood at the door and received the invitation and put the robe around his fellow so the rich and the poor all look alike that's the way it is in the kingdom of god there's no big guys and little guys there's only one guy one christ jesus one in christ oh do you believe that so this man he came to this back door and the master came and said friend how did you get in here with otago jesus said to himself he said he called to the porter bind him foot on hand he was cast into outer darkness where there was weeping and wheeling the national teeth that's christ's own words he was cast out because it proved here we go without the weather and garment he comes some other way besides the door because if he come to the door he would have received the wedding garment he said oh listen to this then if the wedding gamut is the baptism of the holy spirit how are we going to be represented any other way you've got to come by christ jesus the way the truth the life oh hallelujah not by some joining some church and everybody message and everybody brother branham what is that without the door you're only getting started the bible you said the devil believe and tremble oh hallelujah let's continue but here's what i want to get to revelation 1 10 3 13 i want you to notice the voice that he heard speaking to him had the clearness of a trumpet you know our trumpet songs it gave a short song what does a trumpet mean question in the bible what does a trumpet mean war anytime you see a trumpet blow it is war in the bible time it is a song then meant a war then he went further either a revelation or something to take place so identify treatings a war a revelation or something to take place oh glory to god hallelujah hallelujah praise the lord wonderful hallelujah praise the name of the lord thank you jesus hallelujah praise be to jesus thank you lord praise be to jesus give him some give him some wish okay let's continue hallelujah come up here war this is the setting of the great battle the people that rejected god's message rejected the holy spirit the messenger of the seven churches oh the one that had rejected this message of his grace has nothing left but judgment and that's why with a jubilee trumpet song those who don't want to go free had to be bored in the air so that they will have no more effect upon them they have to hear it and they can't be released from their condition because they choose not to go free oh glory to god that's exactly right when it comes to that set spirit set condition he says 50 50 still righteous still holy still oh this is not skim milk hallelujah there's one that rejected this message of his grace had nothing but judgment was ready while he was making ready to pour the place upon the earth come up here i will show you what was taking place hallelujah moses had to act first before he saw the miracles the three human boys had to act first before they saw the fought man in the fire they had to act on the word so the word is not given to sit down just to think about and to talk about and to explain about and to fellowship about the word country to act on it george sent me something i guess i think i'm going to read it sometime not tonight about a woman who came and she was too late for the prayer line and she was healed before of some disease or something like that and she commented back and brahmana was leaving abraham said the same god that helio the first thing will heal you what you have now or something like that and as she got here three months later the miracle was performed on her and it broke brother george mine it would take three months it took three months but it was done i said brother george she was a believer she believed what the prophet said oh glory to god because you have instant miracle and it have span of time miracles so god could give you a miracle and it's already released to you praise god hallelujah praise god it already released you see it yet but already released that blind man he was already healed oh glory to god it might take seven days ten days two weeks one month three months one year it doesn't matter your family shall be delivered he released your miracle he give me back your family already praise god you're waiting on that miracle but you are acting upon what god said [Music] glory hallelujah thank you lord jesus hallelujah praise god joshua let's go back to this morning he marched around the wall exactly like the chief captain told him the enemy was defeated because day was inside the wall but now he was going to get in how he will get inside of there so he took a little stroll to meditate and then he met a man he draw his sword and joshua thought maybe this might wanna be the enemy or whatever he joins are you forced are you against us and he said i am the captain of the host and he told him what to do and it's a kind of hard thing to think watch that you could blow a trumpet and make a wall fall down i want you to think about that the instruction looking kind of flimsy that you could blow a trumpet and make a world fall down but he acted and god makes it simple and silly it goes plum over the head of the lamb it takes those unlearned that don't know very much to understand it but when you try to figure it out you can't figure it out you got to take god's word for it the way he said to do it not the way we think to do it but the way he said do it oh glory to god when i beat you to shout shout and then drop them trumpets on them walls oh glory to god i guess if science would go into it now they might say hold them trumpets start to hit a song and hit some kind of toenail level and and start to zoom some kind of thing they could explain it away right now but god said when i beat you to child shout oh glory to god when i shout there is something reverberation going to start up and i go take it from there like how david was doing a sling and when they even released the stone god david said god said release it and i will take the stone from there oh give the lord a shout but i'm taking a rock and chewed up in the air and then done come a whirlwind he said you have to do something for something to happen give the lord a shout inside of here do you get a church do you get that believers you've got to do something for something to happen not just talk about it do something about it oh hallelujah glory hallelujah hebrew boys they acted upon the word of god they said you should not bow down to any image they will not do it either bowdoin or two in the fiery furnace now wait a minute god is able to deliver us we know what we will do but we are not going to bow down our god is able if he doesn't develop deliver us no problem but we're not going down we obey the word this is what we're talking about if god don't deliver you you're still staying with the because the word is god and when god saw those brothers under the faith have faith to act upon the word he said i come not myself fought man in the fire oh glory to god to bless his sons who stand faithful for him and god some some sons in the last days who are staying with that word and if you stay with the world god will show you a contingency of the word or give the lord a shout oh splew us hallelujah glory to god they acted upon the word of god and then god brought that miracle daniel acted upon the word of god and and then he saw that miracle oh praise the name of the lord do you love him tonight praise god hallelujah matthew 24 verse 2 jesus said unto them see not these things verily i say unto you they shall not be left here one stone upon another that shall not be thrown down and he sat on the mount of olives disciples came unto him privately saying tell us when shall these things be what shall be the sign of thy coming at the end of the world and then jesus said unto them take heed no man deceive you and watch them fellas over there will no man come and tie up and deceive you for many shall come not few shall come in mine and say i am christ and shall deceive many i am anointed hallelujah under bringing false teachings of false word see and you shall hear of wars and rumors of wars do not be troubled for all these things must come to pass but the end is not yet nation shall rise against nation kingdom against kingdom there shall be famines and pestilences earthquakes others places all these the beginning of sorrows then shall they deliver you up to be afflicted and shall kill you and you shall be hated of all nations for my name sake and then shall many be offended and shall betray one another shall hate one another and many false prophets not a few expect them by the

moses time is moses they want to get oh hallelujah but the devil can't get you because god put your name and ordained you to be [Music] nothing going to stop the purpose that god raised you up for and this is how it must be accomplished oh glory to god i don't have long again just exhorting it tonight from isaiah 58 verse 1 god speaking cry aloud spear not lift up thy voice like a trumpet and show my people their transgression and the house of jacob their sins yet they seek me daily and delight to know my ways as a nation that did righteousness and forsook not the ordinances of their god they ask of me the ordinances of justice they take the light and approaching to god wherefore have we fasted say they and thou see us not god look how fast i'm like yeah recognize yes see nothing wherefore have we afflicted our soul and don't take us no knowledge and then god speaks behold in the day of your fast you find pleasure exact all your labors behold you fast for strife and debate and to smite with the face of wickedness you shall not fast as you do this day to make your voice to be healed and i in other words there's a fasting that makes your voice be good and high i call fasting amplified prayer that's when prayer have volume on it oh hallelujah let's continue is such a fast that i have chosen a day for a man to flick his soul is it to bow down his head as a bull rush to spread suck cloth and ashes under him will they'll call this a fast unacceptable day to the lord is not this the fast that i have chosen what for to lose the bands of wickedness to undo the heavy burdens to let the oppressed go free and to break every yoke is it not to deal vibrate to the hungry that don't bring the poor that the castle to thy house when though sees the naked the dog cover him and don't hide not thyself on my own flesh then shall thy light break forth as the morning then hell shall spring forth speedily thy health and thy righteousness shall go before thee the glory of the lord shall be your reward then thou shalt call and the lord shall answer those shall cry and he shall say here i am if thou will take away from the midst of thee the yoke and putting forth the finger and speaking vanity if thou draw thy soul to the hungry and satisfy the afflicted then thy shall thy light rise in obscurity like darkness be as the noonday and the lord shall con guiding continually and satisfy thy soul and drought and make fat thy bones and those shall be like the watered garden like the spring of water whose waters feel not and they that shall be of thee shall build always places thou shalt raise up the foundations of many generations and all shall be called the repairer of the breach the restorer of parts to dwell in we have a great ministry ahead a great calling ahead but there's a cost that goes with it i'm almost done ezekiel 33 reading from verse 1. again the word of the lord came unto me saying son of man speak to the chair of israel and say unto them when i bring the sword upon a land if the people of the land take a man of their coast and set him for their watchman when he see the sword come upon the land he blow a trumpet and warned the people then whosoever here at the song of the trumpet and take it that warning if the sword come and take him away his blood shall be upon his own head he heard the song of the trumpet took not warning his blood shall be upon him but he that taketh warning shall deliver his soul but if the watchman see the sword come and blow not the trumpet and the people be not warned if the sword come and take any person from among them he is taken away in his iniquity but his blood will i require at the watchman's hand oh so this give a different perspective now of this trumpet to be blown oh hallelujah if the watchman don't blow the trumpet and things happen god require it at the watchman's the men so son of man so dawg verse 7 so so thou o son of man i have set thee a watchman unto the house of israel therefore thou shalt hear the word at my mouth and warn them from me when i say unto the wicked o wicked man thou shall surely die if thou dost not speak to warn the wicked from his way that wicked man shall die in his iniquity but his blood will require a dying hand nevertheless if the war on the wicked of his way to turn from it and he turn not from his way he shall die in iniquity but that was delivered thy soul therefore though son of man speak unto the house of israel thus he speaks saying if our transgression of our sin be upon us and we find our way how shall we live say unto them as i live said the lord i have no pleasure in the death of the wicked but that the wicked thing from his way and live turn me from your evil ways why will you die o house of israel so if you see from these scriptures god have a burden for people to really repent because he wants to forgive he wants to restore he wants to heal he wants to bless do you believe that isaiah 21 11 12 the burden of douma he called it to me of the seer watchman what of the night watchman what of the night the watchman said the morning cometh and also the night if he shall inquire inquire ye return come and then baraban and preach that message wash my word at night he says and then he's talking about as soon as we get washed up and groomed up talk about people that's dramatizing we will meet at the tavern as usual and i'm sure john you are you all this table body message we here today watching under the tower trying to make a dick to joy all the whole life trying to tell us there's approaching danger because the watchman in the tower he's seeing something and these people want a party they want to drink and whatnot so he's talking about people talking about it would this watch man want to take away the joy from us he said now what and you know we have the best army there is i mean our soldiers meet each night same place we enjoy fellowship together gambling a few drinks i saw myself he said i would refuse to be alarmed about any of this stuff that this watchman would talk about or rabbis know about this or pastors and so on do you believe that there will be a possible chance the wash man could be right all this warning and warning thing you know we don't have to take that so serious you know this this is barbara you know there's something about danger there's something about debt that seems to have a forewarning of it many times that loved ones before passing across set side a warning comes to them hallelujah a watchman must be on duty at all times he was to warn the people of approaching dangers that was his duty to watch for approaching dana danger he was up in a tower that was built much higher than the walls and this tower had to be up there in it the books of astronomy and so forth he could watch the stars and tell the time any approach and time of the day he could tell it then he was he could see further than anyone on the ground he could see further he was up higher actually before they built the city walls they built the tower that's the first thing they built was it all first thing so they kept piece of land they built a tower and they put was found up there and he watching and even fighting and they watching lane bricks they built the wall they built the gate then they said they built houses they fortified but that watch man you had to put him up there because he had to scan the horizon because there are always some demons some spirits some heights looking to see they could come and take back get back hit back revenge back always that's just the nature of life and the holy spirit is that watchman who is making ready the people and giving warnings to god hallelujah that watchman had to be trained he had to know what he was doing for at any distance as soon as he arose the enemy could detect it he could tell their walk he could tell their match he could tell their color he could tell their rank and file just as far humay could see he could see it he was higher than the rest of them he was trained to know the enemy and god required the whole city as at hand oh my musician come up please oh praise god i'm closing i know we read a lot of scriptures tonight but this is what i got to share with you tonight laura trumpet shake yourself now hallelujah second peter 3 9 the lord is not slack considering his promise as some men called slackness but his long suffering to us what not willing that any should perish but all should come to repentance and hebrews 12. this is all our scripture verse 18 for you are not come unto the monks that might be touched that burn with fire no under blackness and darkness and tempest and the song of a trumpet and the voice of words which voice they heard entreated that the word should not be spoken to them anymore for they could not endure that what was commanded so if as much as a beast such a mountain it shall be stoned to trust you with a doubt so terrible was the sight that moses said i exceed me free and quick but you are commenting among zion under the city of the living god the heavenly jerusalem and into an innumerable company of angels to the general assembly and the chase of the firstborn which are written in heaven unto god the judge of all unto the spirits of judgment made perfect and to jesus the mediator of the new covenant unto the blood of sprinkling that speaketh better things than the donald favor see that he refused at him that speaketh for if they escape not to refuse him to speak on earth how much more shall we not escape if we turn away from his speed from heaven whose voice went shocked the earth but now we are promised yet once more i shake not the earth only but also heaven and this world yet once more signify the removal of those things without
