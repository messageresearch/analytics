[28:22] amen praise the Lord God bless you and
[28:26] uh if you have your Bibles
[28:29] let see what's going on here like to
[28:32] turn to three portion of scriptures in
[28:33] John 1 we want to read verse 12-3 St
[28:37] John 15 1 verse verse 16 Ephesians 1
[28:40] verse4 to 5 St John 1 reading 12 13 as
[28:46] many as receed him to them give he power
[28:49] to become the sons of God even to them
[28:51] which believe on his name which were
[28:53] born not of blood nor of the will of the
[28:57] flesh know of the will of
[28:59] man but of God St John
[29:03] chapter 15 I want to
[29:07] read verse
[29:11] 16 ye have not chosen me but I have
[29:15] chosen you and ordain you that you
[29:18] should go and bring forth fruit that
[29:21] your fruit should remain that whatsoever
[29:24] he shall ask of the father in my name he
[29:26] may give it you
[29:28] our last script is from Ephesians
[29:30] chapter 1 reading verse 4 and five
[29:35] according as the has chosen us chosen Us
[29:37] in him before the foundation of the
[29:40] world that we should be holy and Without
[29:43] Blame before him in love having
[29:46] predestinated us unto the adoption of
[29:50] children by Jesus Christ to himself
[29:53] according to the good pleasure of his
[29:55] will may God bless his word you may be
[29:57] seated praise
[30:06] God good to see all of you out here
[30:08] tonight it's always a blessing to be in
[30:11] the house of God and In God's
[30:14] Presence okay so tonight I have a title
[30:18] chosen in him before the foundation of
[30:21] the
[30:22] world chosen in him before the
[30:26] foundation of the world so God is not
[30:28] just randomly doing things God is
[30:33] deliberate in what he's doing he's
[30:35] deliberate in his objective and motive
[30:38] in what he wants to
[30:39] achieve his word as he declared it my
[30:42] word shall not return unto me void but
[30:45] it shall accomplish what he sent forth
[30:47] to accomplish so this elect was chosen
[30:51] in him and
[30:53] predestinated to be conformed to the
[30:55] word image that's what you're PR Destin
[30:58] unto in other words this is more than
[30:59] coming to the church this is coming to
[31:02] church having knowing that there's an
[31:03] intelligence and a mind of God
[31:05] considering your own life and there's a
[31:08] purpose and objective behind your own
[31:10] life here on this Earth you're not just
[31:12] a random mishap or just happen and so on
[31:15] there's a purpose behind you being here
[31:17] amen praise the Lord
[31:20] amen
[31:23] let turn
[31:25] on all right let's see we go now but BR
[31:29] when Israel left Egypt they all believe
[31:31] in one's Prophet message they seen signs
[31:34] of God by Moses every one of them saw it
[31:36] that each saw come out of Egypt to the
[31:38] Red Sea baptizing into Moses each one
[31:40] saw the power of God strike him when he
[31:42] sang in the spirit when Miriam bit the
[31:44] Tambour each one of them every night eat
[31:46] fresh Heavenly Man Out of the Skies each
[31:48] of those drank of that spiritual Rock
[31:50] and there were two million people left
[31:53] Egypt how many made it to the promised
[31:55] land two two out of two
[31:58] ion and Jesus said they perish your
[32:02] fathers eat Mana in the wilderness for
[32:04] the space of 30 years and they are dead
[32:07] but oh Christians okay if Jesus come he
[32:11] said now there about 500 million
[32:13] Christians in the world tonight counting
[32:15] Catholic Protestant if Jesus would come
[32:17] in that Rapture according to what I've
[32:18] just said there' be 500 missing in the
[32:20] world
[32:22] tonight oh Christians let us buckle on
[32:25] the armor of God let us do all all we
[32:28] know how to serve him love him and wait
[32:32] for that great time there's not going to
[32:36] be great millions and multitudes come
[32:37] out a generation like somebody asked m a
[32:40] question but M the children of Believers
[32:42] are they going to going to heaven what
[32:44] he said no he said God have no
[32:46] grandchildren they have to get the Holy
[32:47] Ghost they have to get the same
[32:49] experience so you can say well because
[32:50] my mother is a preacher or my mother my
[32:53] mother is a saint or my father is a
[32:54] preacher or my father is a elder or
[32:55] Deacon I'm going in no you have to get
[32:57] your own experience so it's serious it's
[33:00] not man you are serving it's God it's
[33:03] not the Prime Minister trying to
[33:04] interview you it's God you have to meet
[33:06] are you with me here we go each day ends
[33:10] a 40-year period for
[33:12] somebody and each day so many is sealed
[33:16] away into the
[33:19] kingdom one day the last day will arrive
[33:23] that mean the sealing is going on
[33:25] tonight God is seeding people into the
[33:28] kingdom of God that's why he said grieve
[33:29] not the Holy Spirit until you by by
[33:32] which you are sealed into the kingdom of
[33:34] God God put in a seal upon you is that
[33:36] right then the prophet said this don't
[33:38] stop don't you stop don't rest day or
[33:40] night until that quickening power has
[33:43] brought you from the things of the world
[33:45] into the kingdom of God and you are
[33:48] truly are brought into the kingdom of
[33:50] God and quickened by the spirit of God
[33:52] how happy with tears of joy we should be
[33:55] on our knees day and night thanking God
[33:57] for what he has done oh praise the name
[34:00] of the Lord thanking God for what he has
[34:03] done oh blessed be the name of the Lord
[34:06] hallelujah praise God and then he begin
[34:08] to describe a story about bam and balac
[34:11] the King ask and and he talking about
[34:13] bam and Bam was not a Suiter he was a
[34:16] prophet of the Lord and that's the man
[34:18] who was asked to curse Israel and he
[34:20] said I can't only I could only speak
[34:22] what God put him my M and we end up
[34:24] blessing Israel isn't that right but bam
[34:27] was not a suit say was a prophet isn't
[34:28] that right and what we get we what and
[34:32] he said and the Lord was with them and
[34:34] every enemy that raised up before Israel
[34:36] was moved out of the way for God said he
[34:38] would send Hornets before them and would
[34:40] drive out the enemy as long as they walk
[34:43] in obedience to his command the job was
[34:45] never too big the amalekites the Giants
[34:48] of the day meant nothing to Israel
[34:50] though they were small man in stature
[34:52] but they were walking in dust say the
[34:53] Lord so when you're walking in dust say
[34:55] the Lord you could be Fearless no weapon
[34:57] form against a could Prosper God I'll be
[35:00] with you even in you no necromancy no
[35:02] funny business no witchcraft nothing
[35:04] could affect you because you're walking
[35:06] in dust sayth the Lord isn't that right
[35:08] praise God in Israel watch Moab is a
[35:11] type of the church they had slew some
[35:13] Kings and WR to the enemy Moab was a
[35:15] nation that served the same God that
[35:17] Israel serve so Moab in the message tro
[35:19] all under the prophet Moses isn't that
[35:21] right and the land of Moab was
[35:23] originally started with lot's Son by his
[35:25] own daughter now Israel was the the Seed
[35:28] of Abraham not of lot Israel come out of
[35:30] Isaac Jacob and Israel sprung out from
[35:33] the 12 tribes of Jacob later called
[35:35] Israel because he wrestled with the Lord
[35:37] isn't that right now every time that man
[35:40] made an organization the spirit of God
[35:42] left it never did return ask any
[35:46] historian he said when they organized
[35:48] God laid it on a shelf because they grow
[35:52] in members but never Awakening of the
[35:55] spirit never no more the numbers looking
[35:59] good but the spirit is poor is absent
[36:02] why because they cap God they cap God to
[36:04] their thing to their Doctrine to their
[36:07] interpretation to their Church they cap
[36:09] God right there and God will not be
[36:10] capped anytime they cap God he move on
[36:12] out oh give the Lord a shout isn't that
[36:15] right I want to get something Moab here
[36:17] was a type of such because they had
[36:19] organized Nation they had their own land
[36:21] and they had they had their own religion
[36:23] and they were moabites believe in
[36:25] Jehovah God they were organized group of
[36:27] people
[36:28] now they represent here we go Church
[36:32] natural Israel represent the spiritual
[36:35] church in his journey so now we know in
[36:38] this message have church natural and
[36:41] church spiritual Hallelujah Church
[36:43] natural and church spiritual in the
[36:45] churches in the groups in the fellowship
[36:48] I don't care how much you say this is
[36:49] God and this is the bride and speaking
[36:50] the bride he say Church natural Church
[36:55] spiritual Hallelujah are you ready and
[36:58] now we find
[36:59] always shout out always when these
[37:03] natural and
[37:05] spiritual spirits of churches and
[37:07] organizations meet there's always a
[37:09] clash
[37:10] yes so don't look for no Clash no Clash
[37:13] I a CL with nobody you know you're not
[37:15] you're not you're not in the real world
[37:17] he said always there is a clash anytime
[37:21] the spiritual natural meat has to have a
[37:23] clash it never failed to be so it always
[37:27] always clashes because we find there is
[37:30] a jealousy in this jealousy it causes
[37:34] caral comparison and impersonation when
[37:37] God does something for an individual
[37:39] everybody tries to copy what God did for
[37:41] that
[37:42] person it causes a
[37:44] competition and it makes canaly and once
[37:47] there's competition there's no
[37:48] cooporation amen people don't cooperate
[37:51] when they competing because they want to
[37:53] beat you they want to win you they want
[37:54] to fight you they want to press you and
[37:56] put you in a corner to say I am top you
[37:58] below I'm the head you are the
[38:00] tail amen there's no cooperation but the
[38:03] prophet said we have to get the unity of
[38:04] the spirit until we come to Unity of the
[38:07] faith and unity of the spirit have
[38:09] nothing to do with Doctrine and teaching
[38:11] it have to do with the quality of spirit
[38:12] in a human being to love God and to
[38:14] serve God and to demonstrate God and
[38:17] Jesus told his own disciples by this
[38:19] shall all men know that you're my
[38:20] disciples not by what you talk by how
[38:22] you love one another how you treat one
[38:24] another and you have to treat each other
[38:26] because you them in front of your eye
[38:28] and if you cannot treat your brother in
[38:30] front your eye right how you going to
[38:31] treat God who you still can't see is not
[38:33] right so you see it caus it comp
[38:35] competition it makes canal and then they
[38:38] cannot the other side get the spiritual
[38:40] results and they take it by political
[38:42] power or substitute something to upset
[38:45] the people's mind what for to draw
[38:48] disciples after
[38:50] themselves so the natural and spiritual
[38:52] C and Abel worship the same God they
[38:54] both built the same kind of altar they
[38:56] both worship the same God at the same
[38:58] church same altar but Cain by caral
[39:01] reasoning brought in the fruits of the
[39:02] land and thinking surely God will answer
[39:05] that but we know what Abel by faith
[39:08] which is by Revelation he just kill a
[39:11] lamb and God approved that oh praise the
[39:14] name of the Lord and that that fate of
[39:17] Abraham is what give him I call it
[39:20] Anthony say a hack that faith is what
[39:22] brought favor with God God make an
[39:24] approval and I approve that son that's
[39:26] revelation
[39:28] Oh Glory to God maybe Abel came was a
[39:30] better behaved person but Abel by Faith
[39:33] by Revelation Oh Glory to God and that's
[39:35] what the church is built upon not
[39:37] feelings not emotions not works the
[39:39] Faith Church is built upon Revelation
[39:42] somebody be backing 40 years walking
[39:44] here tonight and by Revelation something
[39:46] break upon them and they're free and you
[39:48] cannot explain what happened the last 40
[39:50] years 40 years doesn't count your past
[39:52] doesn't count is what is revealed to you
[39:54] tonight oh give the Lord some praises
[39:57] Upon This Rock I'll build my church and
[39:59] the gates of hell can't Prevail against
[40:01] it oh praise God you believe that that's
[40:04] the power of the word that's the power
[40:06] Revelation Jesus can't lie Jesus himself
[40:09] said Upon This Rock I will build my
[40:11] church and the gates of hell can Prevail
[40:14] against it so if we see somebody fall
[40:16] down and flatten what Revelation did
[40:18] they have they had none whatsoever
[40:20] because he said the Gates of Hell cannot
[40:21] Prevail against it and you have man who
[40:23] standing year in year out trial in trial
[40:26] out up the mountain down the valley
[40:28] they're still standing because they have
[40:30] a rock of Revelation and the devil can't
[40:32] take that out joob prove it oh give the
[40:35] Lord I shout though he slay me then I
[40:37] will trust him oh butam proved it when
[40:40] he lost his wife he lost his child
[40:43] Hallelujah he said the Lord Give the
[40:44] Lord take it away because a rock was
[40:46] inside his soul Oh Glory to God you lost
[40:49] this you lost that it doesn't change the
[40:52] faith that God put inside your soul
[40:54] hallelujah praise God but a man didn't
[40:56] come to make weak he come to make us
[40:58] strong he come to turn our us back to
[41:00] the faith of the fathers for you to
[41:02] overcome for you to speak
[41:05] positive Glory
[41:07] Hallelujah great to speak the things
[41:09] they need to
[41:11] speak man notice Abel by faith offer the
[41:15] more excellent sacrifice and the canal
[41:17] believer thought it was the works of his
[41:18] own hands and his fruits his beautiful
[41:20] offering he brought that God would
[41:22] recognize and made it and made a clash
[41:24] we find Abraham and lot had a clash
[41:26] Moses dayon and Kora had a clash is not
[41:29] right Kora was caral I want to raise up
[41:31] organization and and he said you take
[41:33] too much upon yourself the whole
[41:35] conation is Holy you you you are the
[41:37] only holy man we find out that b a lot
[41:40] of problems and when the caral and the
[41:42] spiritual meets there was always a clash
[41:44] when Judas and Jesus meet there was a
[41:46] clash and favor always brings a clash
[41:49] and that's why when Joseph was favored
[41:52] by the father and give that that coat of
[41:54] many colors and had all these dreams
[41:56] that had a CL with his brothers these
[41:58] the older brothers you know these the
[42:00] Big Brothers you know who supposed to be
[42:01] protecting that young man you know they
[42:03] tried to sell him and kill him because
[42:04] they had a problem with what was
[42:06] spiritual upon him and Joseph didn't
[42:08] couldn't help it Oh Glory there was a
[42:10] something inside of him he couldn't help
[42:12] it he couldn't help dreaming he couldn't
[42:14] help finding favor Oh Glory to God
[42:16] that's is how he was that favor they
[42:18] couldn't stop it he found favor in
[42:20] potifa house he found favor in the
[42:22] prison he found favor with Pharaoh he
[42:24] found pharoh right through Oh Glory to
[42:26] God a man that finds favor with god oh
[42:28] don't you want to be that kind of man a
[42:30] man that find favor with God that's the
[42:32] kind of way you want to live not you're
[42:34] not hallelujah praise the name of the
[42:37] Lord do you love him
[42:39] tonight all right just one more this's a
[42:41] backd drop I'm dropping here now now
[42:43] watch the natural always tried to have
[42:45] the spiritual but as in Jacob and Esau
[42:47] now when it comes to doing good works I
[42:49] believe Esau actually was a better man
[42:51] than Jacob in the sight of
[42:54] man so if you're judging with your eyes
[42:57] you say Jacob is my man no Esau is my
[43:00] man because he's a very nice guy you
[43:04] what I'm saying now he had take care of
[43:06] his daddy he was blind a prophet all the
[43:08] tried to do but yet Esau didn't think
[43:11] about that just being Canal work he
[43:13] thought he could get in by what he's
[43:15] done do something good for somebody
[43:18] which is all right but Jacob let we go
[43:21] his whole soul was to get that birth
[43:23] right that is what God recognized in him
[43:27] a spiritual where's the the Holy Ghost
[43:30] his whole soul is got a spiritual
[43:32] breakthrough his whole soul whether you
[43:34] have money or not car or not house or
[43:36] not land or not it doesn't matter what
[43:38] natural come his way he's hungering and
[43:40] thirsting glory to God even David said
[43:43] as the heart pant after the water broke
[43:44] so my soul thirst after the Living God
[43:47] he wasn't letting nothing quench his
[43:48] thirst you kick out whatever trying to
[43:50] tie you up mess you up cover it up you
[43:53] you rip that out your system and let it
[43:55] flow let it grow amen
[43:59] Jacob his whole soul was to get that
[44:01] birth right and that's what God
[44:02] recognized in him as spiritual notice it
[44:04] is always cause the natural to hate the
[44:09] spiritual never the other way around you
[44:11] will never get a spiritual man hating a
[44:13] natural man is always the natural man
[44:16] have the spirit of hate upon him so if
[44:18] somebody hat you let them continue
[44:19] hating you don't hate them back love
[44:21] your enemies do good to them praise God
[44:24] hallelujah don't hate them back
[44:26] Hallelujah love them back because they
[44:28] don't have love to love but you have
[44:30] love to love ask God to give you the
[44:32] love to love them back with you going
[44:34] beat them with love you Hallelujah would
[44:37] bust them with kindness Hallelujah and
[44:39] overow them with humility oh give the
[44:41] Lord some Praises let's go they even try
[44:45] to destroy the influence they try to
[44:48] destroy everything because it's nothing
[44:50] but jealousy it started from Cain prove
[44:53] it was jealousy is still the same today
[44:55] it proves it Satan because jealousy

[48:39] a living Soul Adam was supposed to speak
[48:41] for his sons his son was supposed to be
[48:44] spoken with sons his sons was supposed

[50:18] Way oh give the Lord some Praises
[50:20] hallelujah hallelujah
[50:23] hallelujah it was not God's perfect will
[50:26] for children to be bornn on the earth
[50:28] through sex god created Man Out of the
[50:32] Dust of the earth and breath the bread
[50:34] of life into him and he became a living
[50:37] Soul he took from that man a helpmate
[50:39] and made a wife to him that was God's
[50:42] first an original will but when sin come
[50:46] in and did what it did then he permitted
[50:50] man to marry a wife legally and have
[50:52] turned by her multiply and replenish the
[50:55] Earth then if that's the way you're

[51:19] into sex and through this fall we had to
[51:22] bypass our
[51:23] Tony so we move from thought to flesh
[51:27] and we bypass the word but he chose us
[51:31] he thought of us he predestinated us
[51:35] Romans 8:29 says for whom he did for

[52:12] Justified and whom he justified them he
[52:16] also glorified Oh Glory to God why could
[52:19] he justify us how could he justify us
[52:22] because if Adam didn't do what he did we
[52:24] never be where we are oh Give the Lord a
[52:27] shout we only here because of Adam and

[1:23:00] adoption of children according to the
[1:23:02] good pleasure of his will let me point
[1:23:05] out here that according to these verses
[1:23:08] Jesus Christ is choosing his own bride
[1:23:11] just as men choose their Brides today
[1:23:14] the bride today doesn't simply decide
[1:23:15] she's going to take a certain man for a
[1:23:17] husband it is the groom who decides and
[1:23:20] chooses the certain woman then he quot
[1:23:23] quote the scriptures in joh 156 you have
[1:23:25] not chosen me but I have chosen you the
[1:23:28] bride was chosen before the foundation
[1:23:31] of the world this chosing of the bride
[1:23:33] was purpose in himself that the purpose
[1:23:36] of God according to the election might
[1:23:39] stand you can't read it any other way
[1:23:43] the heart purpose the Eternal purpose of
[1:23:46] God was to take a bride of his own
[1:23:48] choosing and that was purpose in himself
[1:23:52] and being Eternal was decreed before the
[1:23:55] foundation of the world watch carefully
[1:23:58] before there was evered status before
[1:24:01] God was God he was known as the eternal
[1:24:05] spirit the bride was already in his mind
[1:24:09] so when it was eloh him the
[1:24:11] self-existing one alone with his
[1:24:14] thoughts you were in his thinking you
[1:24:17] was part of his mind and the Loos was
[1:24:20] not expressed yet before the logos
[1:24:23] before the
[1:24:25] Elohim Fountain of spirit the rainbow
[1:24:29] the thoughts the gene the attribute that
[1:24:32] is what was dear and in the beginning
[1:24:35] the expression from thought to word was
[1:24:39] the Loos Oh Glory to God so you are a
[1:24:42] germ and when God spoke you were in that
[1:24:46] word oh and because the byass offy you
[1:24:49] have to come back to the word hallelujah
[1:24:52] Give the Lord a shout in the house
[1:24:54] because a word is a thought expressed
[1:24:57] and for you to be expressed you have to
[1:24:59] be expressed through the word oh give
[1:25:01] the Lord some Praises let's go
[1:25:05] watch he was known as eternal spirit the
[1:25:09] bride was already in his mind she was
[1:25:11] existing in his thoughts now what about
[1:25:14] the thoughts of God they are Eternal are
[1:25:16] they not the Eternal thoughts of God let
[1:25:19] me ask you are the thoughts of God
[1:25:22] Eternal God is unchangeable
[1:25:24] in both Essence and behavior we have
[1:25:27] studied that and proven God is infinite
[1:25:30] in his abilities therefore he has God
[1:25:32] must be omniscient if he's omniscient
[1:25:36] then he's not now learning now is he
[1:25:38] taking counsel even with himself nor is
[1:25:42] he at any time adding to his knowledge
[1:25:45] if he can add to his knowledge then he
[1:25:46] is not omniscient the best we could say
[1:25:50] is that sometimes he will be but that is
[1:25:52] not scripture he is omnicient he has
[1:25:55] never had a new thought about anything
[1:25:58] that is nothing to make a shout and run
[1:26:00] he has never had a new thought about
[1:26:02] anything because all his thoughts has
[1:26:05] always had always will have and knows
[1:26:09] the end from the beginning because he is
[1:26:11] God th the thoughts of God are Eternal
[1:26:14] they are real they are not
[1:26:18] simply my God my God my God my god
[1:26:23] listen this but I say
[1:26:25] they are they are not simply like a man
[1:26:28] with a blueprint he has drawn up which
[1:26:30] one day will be translated into
[1:26:32] substance and form but they are already
[1:26:34] real already Eternal and part of God so
[1:26:38] God TS not like a drawing I had to build
[1:26:40] this house you know I I blueprint no God
[1:26:44] taught before it's expressed it's
[1:26:47] already real it's tangible that's why he
[1:26:50] slay the lamb in his mind before the
[1:26:54] foundation of the world that you cannot
[1:26:56] be deceived oh the Lord I
[1:26:59] shout oh Hallelujah help me Jesus
[1:27:03] tonight praise God God always had his
[1:27:06] thoughts for Adam hallelujah hallelujah
[1:27:10] hallelujah watch this now Adam was form
[1:27:13] of the Dust of the earth his spiritual
[1:27:15] being was created by God and when Adam
[1:27:18] became God's thought expressed those
[1:27:21] Eternal thoughts are now Express watch
[1:27:24] he said he has chosen Us in him before
[1:27:26] the found of the world I'm right a close
[1:27:29] that means that we were right there with
[1:27:31] him in the mind and thoughts of God
[1:27:35] before the foundation of the world that
[1:27:37] gives an eternal quality to the elect
[1:27:41] you cannot get away from that oh praise
[1:27:43] God hallelujah hallelujah these elect
[1:27:48] I'm F finishing now these elect were not
[1:27:52] only the Eternal thought of God which to
[1:27:54] be expressed in flesh in their due
[1:27:55] season but this same elect are called by
[1:27:59] another name Romans 4:16 he said
[1:28:02] therefore it's of faith that it might be
[1:28:04] by grace to the end the promise might be
[1:28:06] sure to all the seed neither because
[1:28:09] they were Seed of Abraham are they
[1:28:10] called children but in Isaac shall Li be
[1:28:13] called that is they which are the
[1:28:15] children of the flesh these are not the
[1:28:17] children of God but the chain of Promise
[1:28:20] accounted for the seed Galatians 3:16
[1:28:23] after Abram to re seed with the promise
[1:28:25] given not as seeds as many but as one
[1:28:28] and if ye are in Christ ye are Abraham's
[1:28:31] seed and our ears according to the
[1:28:34] promise Paul puts himself and all
[1:28:37] believers under that designation because
[1:28:40] say Abraham who is the father of us all
[1:28:42] he goes on not only to narrow down his
[1:28:44] definition but rather to finalize it in
[1:28:47] Galatians 3 he identified the seed
[1:28:49] singular with Jesus and counted the seed
[1:28:52] children as children of promise and
[1:28:55] promise have to do with election the
[1:28:57] choosing of God oh give the Lord a
[1:29:00] shout
[1:29:02] election and the chosing of God and that
[1:29:05] is exactly what we have been saying
[1:29:07] those who are of the royal seed are the
[1:29:11] elect of God are the predestinated the
[1:29:14] forn of God when the mind of God in his
[1:29:17] thoughts in very plain language the true
[1:29:20] bride of Christ was in the mind of God
[1:29:23] eternally though not expressed until
[1:29:26] each came forth in the designated
[1:29:28] decreet season and each member came
[1:29:31] forth it become Express and took its
[1:29:33] place in the body thus this bride is the
[1:29:37] literal spoken word seed bride and
[1:29:39] though she is feminine in designation
[1:29:42] she's also called the body of Christ it
[1:29:44] is very apparent she ought to be called
[1:29:47] that for she was predestinated in him
[1:29:50] came from the same Source was eternal
[1:29:52] with him and is now manif esting God in
[1:29:55] a many membered body here we come to the
[1:29:58] conclusion as the Eternal Loos God was
[1:30:02] manifest in the son and Jesus dwelt all
[1:30:05] the fullness of the god Bly that Eternal
[1:30:07] one was the father manifest in flesh
[1:30:10] therefore gain the title of son son even
[1:30:13] so we here we go Eternal in his thoughts
[1:30:15] in our turn become the many member
[1:30:18] spoken word seed manifest in flesh and
[1:30:22] those Eternal thoughts now manifest in
[1:30:24] flesh are the sons of
[1:30:27] God sons of God is not
[1:30:30] trity the Eternal thoughts of God
[1:30:33] manifest In the Flesh hear the B now
[1:30:35] even as we are so called we did not
[1:30:37] become seed by the rebirt we were seed
[1:30:42] and therefore we reborn for only the
[1:30:44] elect can be reborn because we were seed
[1:30:49] is the reason we could be quickened in
[1:30:51] non seed there is nothing to Quicken Oh
[1:30:55] Glory to God hallelujah
[1:30:58] hallelujah glory to God redeem means to
[1:31:01] buy back my sheep hear my voice and hear

[1:31:17] kind there is no change of species as we
[1:31:19] were in the thoughts of God and
[1:31:21] expressing flesh there had to come a day
[1:31:24] when you we would hear his voice the
[1:31:26] word and hearing that voice become aware
[1:31:30] of our father calling us and recognize
[1:31:32] we are sons of God a Son of God can go a
[1:31:35] long time before he recognizes he's a
